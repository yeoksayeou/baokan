<h3>二次太平洋會議之召集難</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>英美日海軍預備會議之初步談話自六月十九日發軔以來。歷經折衝。迄少進展。其中最大癥結。厥為日本主張之堅決。及英國態度之𥡸稜。按日本之軍縮方針。早經擬定。其內容不外要求各國撤廢比率主義而代以總噸數主義。及確保國防自主權軍備平等之原則。觀其實際意義。殆欲廢棄華府海軍條約。以發揮其獨霸中國海與西部太平洋之野心耳。按諸該約規定。如簽約國中之任何一方在一九三四年年底以前宣布取銷者。則期滿卽歸無效。今日本既抱此廢約之決心。自將轉而影響其他各締約國之立塲。夙以維持現約為職志之美國。乃首當其衝。不能不起而積極抵抗。計其抵抗之策略凡二。一則為充實太平尖中美屬海空軍根據地。使日本感覺絕大之威脅。再則在海軍技術與戰略問題中雜以政治問題。使太平洋中各關係國家在政治上有所要求者。可由此而取得加入一九三五年海軍會議之門徑。此點與日本之現有利益互相衝突。亦為識者所公認。最近美政府決撥鉅欵。改造夏威夷等軍港。而華盛頓高級官員中復有研究召集二次太平洋會議及討論政治問題之說殆卽為實行上述二種策略之表現也。</p>
<p>自首次太平洋會議召集以來。太平洋上之局勢。屢有變遷。舉其犖犖大者。則為偽滿之成立。蘇俄勢力之擴充。菲列濱獨立之確定。海空軍技術之進步。及日本［四一七］恫嚇聲明書之宣佈。凡此種種。對於今後太平洋之局面皆有絕大影響。可不待言。</p>
<p>美國前國務卿史蒂生氏以為華府海軍條約與四國條約九國條約等。關係密切。不容分離。而況以今日國際情勢之複雜。往往可以牽一髪而動全身。故海軍問題之不能與政治問題相絕綠者。實因事勢使然。而無從否認。據史氏之理論而推斷。則在日本通告廢除華府海軍條約以後。四國九國二條約亦必將連帶而起變化。按照情理。自應予以重新之估價。顧日本則以為凡此悉為政治問題。不應與海軍問題相並論。而況如。［滿洲事件。前在日內瓦之爭論。已證明會議外交之無效。遠東大局今已明白規定範圍。無事可供討論］云云。觀其強詞奪理之聲口。蓋絕無遷就之誠意。在此美日對立聲中。英人處於舉足輕重之地位。不幸英人之態度。𥡸稜兩可。徘徊於親日親美之歧途中。躊躇不決。影響所及。乃適足以增高日人之氣燄。本年七月十八日。英外相西門答議員之質問。曾謂一九三五年海軍會議除海軍問題外。不致擴大範圍。討論太平洋與遠東之政治問題。說者謂英政府與日人事前早有默契。故能言之鑿鑿。此言而信。則華盛頓方面縱有召集二次太平洋會議之宣傅。去事實上之可能性實甚遠也。</p>
<p>吾人猶憶第一次太平洋會議。雖假美總統哈定之名義而召集。其動機實出於英國之慫恿。而英屬各自治殖民地因不滿於英日同盟之存在。竭力催促。尤為熱列。今觀於英人之態度。已足使人深抱悲觀。而況當第一次大會之召集。歐戰甫停。人心厭亂。和平聲浪。風靡一時。故赴會者。咸抱相當之誠意。再以遠東方面言。中日間之重要懸案。首推山東問題。日人明知英法意美等國在巴黎和會席上。皆曾主張將德人在山東之利益轉讓日本。此一問題如在大會提出。勝利必操諸已。故尚敢有恃而無恐。然仍以為此次赴會。無殊於出席國際法庭。聽候公判。遲疑至再。勉強就道。至於今日之東京政府。早為軍閥所操縱。與首次會議時已不可同日而語。而滿案之污點。又經舉世指摘。與當時山東問題之情勢。亦大相懸殊。其不肯率爾參加二次太平洋會議。以從事於政治問題之討論。庸有疑義。日本茍不參加。則［會］且不成。［議］於何有。足見華盛頓方面之宣傅。充其量亦不過為威脅日本之一種策略而已。固萬難見之於事實也。</p>
<h3>海軍談判入於重要階段</h3>
<p>日覆文送交英代表</p>
<p>英日舉行五次會商</p>
<p>三國談話失敗英美先謀妥協</p>
<p>倫敦日英第五次會談、決定於十九日下午三時半開始、（十九日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦海軍談判頃已入於最後決定之陛段、英國外交界某要人今晨向英國報界宣言、謂一般人現擬在理論上承認日本海軍平等權之原則、但英國政府則欲發見一種協定之方式、使英美海軍在事實上得保持相當優勢云、又據今晨消息、日本方面似已承認英帝國海軍防衛之廣大需要、但對於美國與英國有同等之海軍需要、則不允加以承認云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦日本對於英國折衷方案之覆文、今夜將由日大使松平送交英外相西門、聞英國在其建議中指出日本聲明雖欲得共同高度、但未有造艦逹此程度一節、故英國詢問日本其為體面起見而作海軍平等之要求、可否一方面以日本地位平等之承認、及一方面以海軍力量規定之繼續饜滿之、同時英國又向日本提出另一意見、各國海軍之比較的力量、不妨由各國將其五年或十年內之造艦程序預先宣佈、以便多少維持其現有程度、俾代替華盛頓比率、衆料今夜松平與西門會見時、將佈置英日全體代表之會議、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>同時英國正在努力以求商獲妥協、如不能實現、則英美間將先謀妥協、庶日本能於稍緩加入之、英方覺華盛頓公約中有可貴之若干條文、應加保存、例如在約之國添造軍艦、應通告他國、及不設軍備之條文、（第十九條）但此節今尚未作密切之計論、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦日本拒絕英國所提出之海軍折衷方案後、英美代表卽於星期杪籌商打破海軍討論僵局之方法、美代表現殷待華盛頓對英國所提準備訂結新約血每國均作讓步建議之覆文、美方對於新取又途徑、仍抱樂觀、所謂新途徑者、卽許日多置潛艇、許美多置大戰艦與飛機母艦、許英多置巡洋艦、在原則上承認日本之平等、而仍保留五五三比率是也、聞日本對於比率問題、仍堅持其原來主張、而一方面則在研究一種妥協方法、俾使其於建造軍艦上得事撙節、而免在國內喪失顏面、英外相西門將於今日宣布海軍談話最近之局勢、但在發言之前、英國將以星期杪外交部克萊奇與日大使署參贊加藤談話之情形通告美代表、美代表對於加藤近致克萊奇公文之性質、迄今尚毫無所知也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國外交努力調和美日異見</h3>
<p>尋求技術折衷方式</p>
<p>免致談話陷於破裂</p>
<p>倫敦外相西門與日本駐英大使松平、定於本日午後五點四十五分會晤、此次會晤、將為一種外交式之談話、蓋談話目的、多半在於謀避免因日本拒絕妥協對於海軍談判所可發生之影響、而不在於討論一種折衷方案、以調和現有各種不同之主張、本日英日談話中、將由松平大使詳細說明日本政府對於英國建議案之答覆、一般人承認日本拒不接受英國建議之結果、倘出以鹵莽滅裂之方式、則海軍談判必將完全失敗、因此本日會商、雙方之任務、乃在設法使下次談話時、空氣不至過於緊張、或將出以矯揉造作之方式、俾儘可能範圍、緩和日美間之衝突、一般人以為松平大使較諸日本海軍代表山本中將、更具妥協之傾向、據今晨松平大使左右人士所稱、如美國接受日本提案之原則、則日本可在細目上作相當讓步、以相交換、惟此種宣言、僅係日本代表團一部分之意見、當屬無疑、日本代表團內部意見既不一致、英國方面擬乘機運用、以謀轉團之法、但如以為日本代表團內部意見、有根本之差別、則不免言之過甚、緣日本代表團內、外交人員以為談判失敗、如不能避免、則至少當避免談判失敗之責任、不寗唯是、英國此種外交活動、能否獲得結果、亦成疑問、至於美國方面人士對於日本軟化之可能、頗抱悲觀、美國某代表曾謂、［茲事體大、不易收拾］、總之、海軍談話在本星期以內、將專由英國方面作二重之努力、首先圖謀避免談判立刻趨於緊張、繼則尋求技術的折衷方式、而此種努力、或將由麥唐納首相出面為之、蓋首相因英國內政外交關係、亟欲避免談判破裂、較任何人尤切也、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法名記者觀察談話難期成就</h3>
<p>巴黎名記者貝蹄納在巴黎廻聲報發表論文、評論海軍談話問題、謂［日本對于英國所提之折衷案、必將拒不接受］其主曰、［英人如欲挽救一九二三年及一九三○年華府及倫敦兩次海會之成績、不任其歸于消滅、則須依照如下方法表示讓步、卽各國所能建造之各種軍艦、不再要求限定雙數、而將各種艦型之噸數及武裝加以限制是也、但此種方式、將使一九三五年海軍會議程序為之縮減、姑不論美國極端反對、卽日本亦未必樂於接受、美國所以反對者、端因此種方式一經採用、則該國不復能利用其財政工業上之優越地位、以建造超過他國之偉大軍艦、至於日本、則其海軍當局正擬恢復自由、以便從事於海軍技術之改進、質的限制自亦非該國所樂聞也］云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>召開太平洋會日本付之一笑</h3>
<p>東京據華盛頓消息、美國官方擬召集以討論政治問題為目的之太平洋各國一般會議、現正在考慮之中、而日本外交當局對此付之一笑、所持意見如下、美國方面既同意倫敦預備會商、不討論政治問題、縱令提唱此種會議、英國必不贊成、卽日本目下日美間並無爭論之問題、現以廣田赫爾之換文為外交基調、故開多邊的國際會議等不成問題云、（十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>美日意見懸隔英方求兩全策</h3>
<p>海軍限制重質不重量</p>
<p>倫敦星期泰晤士報載稱、若干方面對於海軍量的限制一項原則、批評日甚、謂如以最為限制、［則主張大海軍者、必將貪得無厭、而此日所認為最高數量、明日卽將認為最低數量云、一般人以為美日兩國之見解、長此相持、實非長策、有傅說海軍談話將迅速向一新方向進行、蓋以量的限制、徒使各國增加大批海軍經費、而彼些海軍相比較之力量、未必因之加強、因而主張注重質的限制、英國政府已為此說所動、觀於此次海軍談話、財相張伯倫積極參加、可見倫敦政府不願增加財政負擔明矣、吾人因此相信海軍談話、將努力於各種軍艦大小及武裝強弱之限制、藉以擴大華府海約、關於質的規定、此種辦法英國方面至最後時期、必有採用之可能、特此種辦法雖於日本所提要求間接相合、而其遭美國之抵杭、必然無疑、緣美國代表臺維斯及其同僚、對於原有見解堅持不讓、且嚴格保守一種原則、卽維持華府海約、不增不減］是也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>廣田會見岡田</h3>

<h3>日本海軍要求追加預算</h3>
<p>東京海軍首腦部關於海軍豫算堅決要八千九百萬元之復活、海軍所主張之理由如次、一主力艦應依照既定方針、於昭和十一年完畢改裝為國防上絕對必要之事、主力艦改裝經費、無論有任何理由、絕對不能讓步、二新艦維持費及航空隊維持費為實行二次補充計劃之必要經費、海軍絕對要求此經費之被承認、三水陸整備費、及軍用品整備費、亦係實行國防計劃之絕對必要經費、當然要求其實現、四日本政府不惜國防預算之態度、在海軍預備會議及明年軍縮會議能使日本主張容易貫澈、（十九日日聯電）</p>

<p>敦煌多古蹟、最著名者有二、一日月牙泉、是天然的、一日千佛洞、是人工的、皆各充分顯示其名勝特點、殊有一述之價值、月牙泉、卽古涯洼池、漢武帝元鼎四年秋、天馬出渥洼水中、武帝得之、作天馬之歌、卽此、先是有山自安西來、多青黑石、伸入敦境、化為白沙嶺、質色雖截然不同、而山脈仍屬一貫、沙嶺行至城南、約十里處、支脈相錯、成一幽谷、隨口繞入、有泉一望清碧、窈然以深、周約一里、依山作月眉形、故名月牙泉、</p>
<p>泉味甘美、中產鐵背魚、七星草、服之可長壽、泉深傅有四十丈、嘗游泳其中、覺其浮力較弱、中心碧綠清幽、瞰不見底、頓疑身若憑虛、為之一驚、草草圍繞邊際、蒼勁稀疎、別具風緻、牙泉之背、為一淺草坪、三四丈外、沙山壁立、高三十馀丈、危峭逾於山石、嶺背如刀刃、人登之、隨足頹落、經宿風吹、輙復還如舊、坐而脧下、作轟轟響、有時雖在晴天、亦自然發出殷殷之雷聲、故有［嗚沙］之稱、掬沙檢視、明分五彩、亙古沙不填泉、泉不涸竭、此皆泉之神秘、輙令常人百思莫解、月泉之裹、地勢稍高、榆楊沙棗、蔚然成林、中建嗚山寺。三聖宮。藥王廟。等寺、高閣凌霄、曲廊入勝、但占不多、因後又有高嶺之限制也、俛瞰四周沙隴、相契相套、又另呈一月眉樣、因亦有月牙山之稱、</p>
<p>有臺曰［第一泉］、正當泉裹中心、足供遊憇、由臺北視、始為月泉裹緣之蘆葦、繼為月泉中段、汪然碧波、若動若靜、四周景物、倒影千變、再遠卽為草坪、為壁立之嗚沙山、左右顧盼、卽月牙之兩角、深深包抄於後、倘不移步數十丈、卽難目窮其極、遊人至是、每詩與大發、遍題所感於臺壁、額有［月泉一色］、［別有天地、］聯有［泉通星宿海、嶺接火炎山］、詩有［敦煌城南衆峯峙、蹊徑別開林壑美、積沙成嶺勢突元、萬古風吹沙不起、］歌有［……沙聲一嗚四大空、衆山皆響歌大風、尋聲不知何處是、人間恍惚廣寒宮……］、千佛洞。亦名雷音寺、在城東南四十里、不知建自何時、惟有斷碑、云為唐代重修］疏巖鑿石、成洞千百、佛龍層疊、廟貌壯麗、頗似大同雲崗之作品、然亦有其異岡乃細沙所凝、此為大如蠶豆之粗砂所成、前者色黃、後者色青、三此處塑佛、什九為女像、尤其多數侍者、體成嬌嬈、裸露上身、細腰修腿、富有西洋彫刻美人之姿式、三間有黑像、想係塑黑種人之修佛者、四佛窟雖多至千百、但佛像大部雷同、五雲岡佛像、無論大小、概就原巖鑿之、此處大佛泥塑、小佛彩畫、殊異雲岡、但極工緻、且由上述二三兩點、可證此處之佛像、已顯然帶有中西合璧之色彩、此皆雲岡佛洞之所無、</p>
<p>千佛洞、萃鑿一崖之剖面、高分四五層、傅各層洞外、昔有樓閣聯貫、今已全毀、惟一二層、可得遊覽、嘗見兩大洞、塑佛高十丈、且為坐像、中一洞、現正重修九層大殿、（發插影）聞已用資五萬元、另有一右側橫臥之大佛、長亦七八丈、其後。排立丘尼丘僧七十二、狀如生人、惟丘尼體態高健、頗似西女、且有二三番裝者、其馀中小洞、大可二三立方丈不等、洞衾正中之坐佛、多屈石臂、舉掌胸前、左手。則撫於所盤之左膝、頗有荘嚴肅穆之氣象、旁配侍者、各三四位、立坐倚斜、姿式活潑、撚花捧瓶、表情各異、（如插影）</p>
<p>旁侍女像之裝飾、類為肩上圍一項圈、作金色、中緊數金花、分垂兩肩及前後胸、手腕手臂、各套滿嵌寶玉之金鐲兩雙、另用五彩飄帶、自右肩斜披下、而打結於左脅、兩乳一臍、有被飄帶所掩者、有完全祼露者、腰下垂裙、長及腳背、赤足玉趾、脈脈欲動、</p>
<p>三千年前、佛教東漸、敦煌首當其衝、一時文物燦爛、在中西文化溝通史上、當點重要之一頁、清季外人司坦因及伯希和等、卽在敦煌千佛洞、因雨陷落之石窯中、發現古西夏圖籍、手寫漢番佛經、及唐咸通九年、中國本部王玠印施之金綱經等、皆被擇尤竊去、誠頹世之珍也、民國十年、有白俄數百人、得楊增新（時任新省督軍）介紹、來此避難、又於最高層之窟中、見一女子跌坐、以真金玉為裝飾、華貴一如佛像、白俄一一竊去其寶物、女屍卽頹然而散、視如灰土、嘗讀一［莫高窟碑］、記青海王后公主捐金修寺事、想此華貴女屍、或卽此輩古代貴族婦女之修佛者也、各洞精彩之壁畫、歷久而色不變、亦多被外人偷拓而去、所幸特畫全國像形圖之一洞、尚屬完璧、當時某外人、復賄白俄十萬金、囑設法竊之、事為敦煌人士所悉、極力保護、始得無恙、如此佛洞古物、工偉效杳、創時確係勞民傷財、但既經古人創造成功、在某種意義上、後人卻有保管之價值焉、</p>
<p>千佛洞東南、隔岸數里、三峯聳峙、危然欲墜、是卽［舜流四兇、徒之三危］之山也、三危山。昔誌高巔積雪、四時不消、近代想因氣候變遷、僅冬日見雪矣、又城西一百四十里、為漢龍勒縣地、後改置壽昌縣、再西六里、卽古詩西出無故人之陽關、今均葬於荒沙中、壽昌已掘獲漢磚而認定、惟陽關尚不知究在何處、楊縣長擬於秋涼時、前往挖尋、如成事實、諒必有有價值之古物發現、</p>
<p>記者由敦返安、適值哈密緾頭商人、名［阿薩］者、將驅駝隊、返新經商、承遠岑君介紹、決於明日、相偕西進、邊疆絕塞、郵電鮮通、將來觀感如何、恐須於東返後、始獲與讀者再見也、（十月四日）</p>

<h3>法租界郁寳善堂主婦綁案全部破獲</h3>
<p>蘇滬先後擒到綁匪</p>
<p>肉票業已安全起出</p>
<p>上月二十一日晨八時許、法租界西愛咸斯路第六十號粵籍富商郁寳善堂之老主女郁老太太、乘自備包車擬赴天主堂祈禱之際、詎甫出門、行抵附近江蘇高三分院門口、突被三匪、綁入停於路旁事先預向黃色汽車公司、白克路分行租來之第一二○三二號之汽車內、綁匿無蹤、詳情已誌本報、惟本案發生氨今、將近匝月、因綁匪狡詐性成、無從獲取綫索、但絕因法捕房中西警務人員之努力、卒於昨日將本案全部破獲、肉票安然起出、計在蘇州本埠兩地、先後捕獲綁匪多名、茲將詳情分誌於下、</p>
<p>太太信教</p>
<p>綠法租界西愛咸斯路江蘇高三分院西首第六十號門牌、為素負財名之粵商郁寳善堂大廈、內有女主人郁老太太、雖年逾花甲、而精神矍鑠、尤篤信天主教、每逢星期假日、氏必往教堂參與彌撒禮、行之既久、從無間斷、惟儉約成性、外出時僅以包車一輛、（市照會七五七號租界八三○號）以代步、</p>
<p>綁上汽車</p>
<p>上月二十一值禮拜日、氏於七時卽起身、盥洗既畢、稍進早餐後、時已八時有零、氏亟卽跨上包車、車夫陸惠祥、卽將車挽出、向東直拉、詎甫拉抵高三分院西首第五號門牌門口、突由迎面擁上綁匪三人、各出手槍、追令車夫止步停車、同時兩匪卽將郁氏挾入預停路旁一黃色汽車中、風馳電掣向東而去、而該汽車號碼、第一二○三二號、</p>
<p>捕房追緝</p>
<p>當時包車夫陸惠祥目擊主婦被綁、已嚇得呆若木雞、良久驚魂稍定、急將空車拽回、歸家報告、隨由家人據情、轉報該管盧家灣總巡捕房、再待捕頭大批中西探捕四面追拿時、奈已查如黃鶴、捕頭急用電話通知公共租界及公安局各分警局注意截獲、但卒無影蹤、直至當日中午十二時許、該項汽車、始發現於高朗橋蘭路附近、但已人去車空、卽汽車蔡阿毛、亦同時失蹤矣、</p>
<p>綁匪租車</p>
<p>先是本埠著名黃色汽車公司白克分行、於當日七時二刻左右、突來不速顧客兩人、一著深綠綢衫、頭戴瓜皮小帽、一御灰色長衫者殿後、聲稱租車一輛、單送至北泥城橋珊家園、言時卽從身畔取出現洋一元、付給該行賑房、賑房卽派汽車夫通州人蔡阿毛、（年三十六歲）駕駛租界照會第一二○三二號汽車、兩人相繼登車、直馳而去、</p>
<p>監視嚴密</p>
<p>自從索發生後、法捕房警務當局、異常重視、加之肉票都老太太又係現任法捕房盜案班西副探長萬郎登之岳母、故性質尤顯重要、法捕房全體探員、晝夜購尋綫索、卒因匪徒狡詐多商、終無要領、更因捕房之覧視週密、故毫無接洽馀地、</p>
<p>突來雨函</p>
<p>直至半月前、郁宅突接匪方寄來一函、署名洪軍總司令王寳端、函內命家屬卽日至蘇州三新旅館贖票、郁宅曾一度派人至蘇、但匪卒未出面、遂又返滬、詎至最近、郁宅又接第二函、約定於昨日下午一時、仍在蘇州原旅館談判、</p>
<p>接洽符號</p>
<p>匪方來函、並寫明來人接洽標識、須攜花雕酒二瓶、紅錫包香煙五罐、綱籃一隻、籃中有橘子水梨等物、郁宅接函後、遂密報法捕房、捕頭卽先派出女探員二人、然後以正探目張子楹。探目周步廣、化裝為郁宅家人、於三時十時抵蘇、不料張。周二探、甫行下車、</p>
<p>嫌疑犯供</p>
<p>卽在月臺上發現一穿西服、一御長袍之形跡可疑兩少年、兩探審視確定、遂立卽加以逮捕、會同車站長警押赴蘇州、公安局經蘇偵緝隊、細詰一過、一供名王福庚、一名奎仲英、直認接洽贖票不諱、並立時供明肉票現仍在上海榆林路三百八十六號亭子間內</p>
<p>兩探協捕</p>
<p>張。周兩探詢明藏票所在後、乃卽用長途電話向滬報告、時已入晚七時、由西總探長繞伯澤。副探長萬郎登。華督察長金九林、率同正探目錢裕民。副探目蘇石癡。王榮桂。周秉澄。包探蔣長文。張春勝。楊以隆。秦有裕。尹寳珂。金炳文。王茂柳等、會同公共捕房探長蘇長生。包探金萬榮。劉子生。湯鵬飛。及預備隊多名、按址馳往、比抵目的地時、紛紛將該屋四下包圍、然後由包探張春勝、首先奮勇衝入、時亭子間及樓上匪衆業已聞警、開槍拒捕、故張探大腿命中一彈、但此時匪膽已餒、衆探乘虛一擁而入</p>
<p>擒獲四匪</p>
<p>匪共四人、一鼓成擒、奪獲手槍兩支、子彈八十馀粒、肉票自亭子間內、安然救出、但已被驚跌仆受傷、四匪一名林德、三十歲、一名陶水根、四十一歲、江惠之、三十四歲、另一看票又匪名周菊琴、二十四歲、均紹興籍、惟林犯腰部已傷、陶匪一指已斷、連同肉票、均齊送廣慈醫院醫治、</p>
<p>蘇犯提滬</p>
<p>至蘇州人所獲兩匪、本定晚間十時來滬、法捕房特派探員多人、前往迎接、並請該管寳山路分局、加派長警多人保護、堆至午夜十二時始到、立卽押上警車、直駛盧家灣捕房、歸案訊辦、一面嚴緝馀黨、</p>

<h3>柏林中國學生槍殺德國女友</h3>
<p>傷女友後復自殺</p>
<p>情塲慘變之結果</p>
<p>國民新聞社十九日柏林電、有中國學生名胡昌揚（譯音）者、以手槍將其十五歲之德國女友擊傷後、又復以槍自殺、該德少女已送入醫院就診、其勢甚危、據云彼二人友好甚篤、此次女者忽欲分離、致有此不幸之結果、故此慘劇大約係因妒生忌所致、各報皆載其事、惟並不作左右袒、而認其</p>
<p>為人生一大不幸而已、</p>
<h3>警察探監竟敢私遞煙泡</h3>
<p>查明斥革送法院訊辦</p>
<p>南市某警察所巡警俞子濂、前日突至地方法院看守所、探望在押之友人陳三緣、陳為黑籍中人、俞晤談之際、暗遞煙泡數枚、俞卽慌忙離所、當為所丁見而生疑、乃將陳周身搜檢、在手掌中、發現煙泡四枚、詰其何來、陳語詞吞吐、該所丁明知為探望者遞給、遂呈明所長查閱家屬接見簿、始悉探望者名俞子濂、且注明為某警察所巡警、當由所長據情面陳鍾尚斌首席檢察官、以該警知法犯法、咎由自取、乃函致市公安局、將俞子濂先行斥革、立解地方法院、由檢察官訊供判押候辦</p>
<h3>人力車夫反對登記</h3>
<p>擬具理由五點送工部局</p>
<p>交董事會核議取消登記</p>
<p>新新社云、本市人力車總代表陳國樑。錢有福。徐慶子。姚勝亭。陸紹德。萬月興。李少慶。等五萬人、反對工部局新章令公用人力車夫登記事、迭次呈請工部局收回成命在案、曾於本月十六日下午三時、各代表向工部局請願、要求取消登記事、由副總辦菲利浦君接見時、車夫代表陳國樑等陳述車夫登記困難情形事實、必致發生重大糾紛、並蒙菲君允即轉達鍾總辦、請提交董事會討論、茲悉該會昨日根據議決案、再函工部局補充理由、要求取消車夫登記、請求提交董事會核議、各情如下、</p>
<h3>車夫生活</h3>
<p>一如車夫登記、規定每輛黃包車夫、登記三人或四人、分為日夜班、支配拉車營業、查滬上車夫有八萬馀人、過半數為謀過渡生活性質、該三人分為甲乙丙、倘甲另有別種生意出缺、尚有乙丙二人、如乙得病、尚有丙、如丙一人能否拉日夜兩班、如丙再返江北外、車夫既有示登記不能拉車之規定、是以此輛祇可停業、車捐亦必無著、損害三方面之利益、此為不能登記理由之一、</p>
<h3>往返不定</h3>
<p>二查車夫多數係江北籍、每年舊習慣、春去冬來、倘或春季車夫登記後、即返江北務農去、尚有不務農之車夫來滬、一心謀拉車者、並未登記、即不能拉車、不但影響生計、尚且有來的盤川、而無去的路費、時車夫是否懷恨不利之新章、將來有車子無人拉、有人有車子不能拉、此不能登記理由之二、</p>
<h3>失業影響</h3>
<p>三查現時特區人力車夫與華界小照會之車比較、雙方車夫之滿足、查特區車夫八萬馀人、如發生登記合格三萬人、其馀被淘汰之五萬馀車夫失業、無家屬妻子兒女合算之下、有十馀萬平民影響生計、發生恐慌、即行鋌而走險時、不但承放人、決向車夫追討、欠欵之糾紛、未能登記之車夫、與登記之車夫一個要拉車子、一個不許拉、雙方必定不但要拼死、大起奮鬬、將關係租界治安、此為不能登記理由之三、</p>
<h3>車樣問題</h3>
<p>四表示換車樣問題、我們車夫不知你們將車樣改得如何地步、由承放人放於我們車夫手中、即是車夫問責任、查滬地電車汽車、無路不有、即是車夫問責任、查滬地電車汽車、無路不有、倘或汽車行駛疾速、一經將人力車撞毀、逃去時、車夫將彼撞毀車輛、拉至車公司內、承放人必定要令車夫負責賠償、如車價重大、車夫亦負賠償之南、將來賠償之責任、概不負擔、如改造新車樣與車夫、頗不相宜、</p>
<h3>救濟車夫</h3>
<p>五車夫五濟會、由該委員會操縱組織、查組織之種種設施情形、不但與救濟車夫事實不符、尚且耗費公欵、如果照此情形辦理、將來事主必定藉口停止助費、反將前功盡棄、如符貴工部局救濟車夫之互濟會、撥歸勞資雙方管理、以便澈底化除爭端、方可達到目的、</p>

<h3>特載憲法草案關於中央政府的一章（續）</h3>
<p>演講者立法委員陶履謙</p>
<p>地點上海八仙橋青年會</p>
<p>－時間十一月十七日下午七時卅分－</p>
<p>第三點　照現行制度、五院之上、有國民政府之組織、復有介乎黨政之間的中央政治會議、為一切政治策動之源泉、故五院名義上為最高機關、實際上則重要事件、必須請命於政治會議、國民政府幾成為政府會議與五院間之承轉機關、雖國民政府組織法內、有國民政府委員會議之規定、而事權不屬、意義早失、此種制度、本為訓政時期試行之方式、若憲法頒布、憲政告成、則中央政權屬於國民大會、（建國大綱第二十四條、治權分屬五院、政權與治權之界限、既經畫分清楚、政治會議、當然可以不設、至五院各有專司、權責分明、分之則為各個獨立機關、合之則構成中央政府、（總理總於五權憲法之演講內第三圖）故亦不必於五院之外、另組具體的國民政府、以凌駕五院之上、論者每以五院獨立、行使職權為疑、主張應由總統督率五院而總其成、或設國務會議、以為五院綜合調和之具、否則五權分立之極、勢必閡隔散漫、不易形成強有力之中樞、履謙對於此種顧慮、不敢謂為無相當理由、立法院同人亦未嘗不注意及此、但茂採用上述兩種方法、則五權憲法之精神將根本消滅、而五權憲法可以不定、蓋總統雖為國家元首、第元首職權有一定限度、即本章第三十六條至四十三條所列舉者、至其兼攬行政權、則為憲法所特別堪予、而非元首本身所自有、故總理演講五權憲法、亦僅謂［在行政人員、］一方面另外立一個執行政務的大總統一、並未嘗謂五院　　　總統督率而總其成、倘憲草規定總統　　　　　院之權、則其結果必致五權變為一權、　　　　不堪設想者、即在三權制下之國家、亦無此辦法也、若欲藉國務會議來綜合各院有關係的事務、調和各院間的感情、以期減少糾紛、用意何嘗不善、惟在憲法頒布以後、我們應該面望各機關都能守法、不應該希望以調和手段、情感作用、來毀壞法治的軌道、果使各機關能夠守法、則職權既定、各負責任、似無綜合之必要、倘甲侵乙權、則侵者固然違法、即受侵者亦屬溺職、更無調和之可言、況五院中如立法院。如監察院。均為委員制、為集議制、全院向國民大會負責、與司法考試兩院由院長負責者不同、即使有國務會議之組織、立監兩院院長亦不能代表全體、事實上仍多窒礙、因此上述兩種辦法、立法院同人、認為不能採用、但是中央之有五院、猶如人身之有五官、雖然各有機能、各司專職、並非彼此隔絕、痛癢無關、我們總想在五權分立的原則下、尋出一種聯絡貫通的途徑、同時我們覺得五院之中、立法監察兩院、對於其他三院、關係較多、亦最易發生誤會、因此在第六十五條及第九十三條、規定立法院監察院得向各院各部各委員會提出質詢、此種質詢既無不信任權為後盾、其性質與國會的質詢權完全不同、不過係詢間明白免除閡隔的意思、且立法院得向行政司法考試監察考試提出質詢四院監察院亦得向行政立法司法四院提出質詢、並非專對行政部分而設、譬如立法院通過一件法律案、總統已經公布、而主管機關尚未執行、在此種情況之下、立法院當然可以提出質詢、主管機關、應將延緩執行的原因、詳細答覆、又如監察院訪聞某公務員有違法的舞弊的嫌疑、但對於其真相內容、不甚清楚、儘可於提出彈劾之前、先向某機關提出質詢、某機關應負確實答復之義務、監察院再就其答覆情形、決定彈劾案之應否提出、有此種聯絡辦法、不獨無形中可以減少無數糾紛、亦不致有各自為政各不相謀之弊、況按第三十七條規定、總統依法公布法律、發布命令、並須經關係院院長之副署、此條足以表明總統與各院間的聯屬關係、而含有二種意義、在總統方面、可以公布法律、發布命令、但附有條件、即（一）須依法、（二）須經關係院長副署、在五院方面、凡本院已經解決的事項、如係法律、應送請總統公布、如係應以總統名義發布之命令、（如特赦宣戰任免官吏等）應送請總統依法辦理、是總統雖祇兼管行政、而對於其他四院之重要事項、未嘗不得預聞、特不能干涉耳、所謂分之則為各個獨立機關、合之則構成中央政府、義即在此、至恐各院間發生衝突相持不下、則法律上之解決、國民大會制裁、均足以濟其窮、似毋庸鰓鰓過慮也、</p>
<p>第四點　按照總理遺教、憲法制定之後、由人民選舉總統以組織行政院、選舉代議士以組織立法院、其馀三院院長、則由總統經立法院之同意而委任之、現在憲草規定行政院長由總統自由任免、立法監察兩院院長、由國民大會選舉、而司法考試兩院院長、則由總統經立法院之同意任命之、與總理所定辦法、微有出入、但精神上並無衝突、因監察權本屬立法機關、總理為防止立法機關假借彈劾權以挾制行政機關起見、纔把監察權從立法機半中分出、立監兩院、既係同一的來源、所以兩院長的產生方法、亦不妨相同、又監察院職司糾案、不獨可以彈劾一般公務員、並且可以彈劾總統、如果監察院院長人選、由總統提出、總統方面、平時易受操縱監察院的嫌疑、而萬一總統被劾、監察院院長所處的地位、亦不免感受困難、根據上述理由、我們決定監察院院長、亦由國民大會選舉、嚴格的保持監察權獨立之精神、（未完）</p>

<h3>人類的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>人類的悲劇就在這兒吧！不信神，但卻要造出一個神的偶像，讓自己來膜拜。但等到這個神的偶像快完成，自己的信心又動搖了，再把這偶像用自己的手打毀，另造一個神的偶像，但這偶像的命運依然像先前一樣，在半途中被自己的手所打毀。希伯來人說上帝創造人，是按照上帝自己的形相。事實上是人造上帝，按照人自己的形相。毛病就出在這兒。因為人既按照他自己的形相來造上帝，賦與了上帝形相，卻沒有賦與了他內在的生命－一個不斷適應環境的力量。所以一當人類日在變動過程中的外在環境一有了變革，人類過了不久卽會適應那新的環境，而神的偶像卻無這種能力，人就不得不打毀這舊的偶像，而造一個新。</p>
<p>在希臘，有著宙斯（zeus）纂奪他的父親克羅諾　斯（cronos）的神話，在基督教，也有著當耶穌誕生的時候，野林中有人聽見宣告盤神（pan，乃基督教徒所認為一切異端的代表）死的消息，這是新的偶像，去毀滅舊的偶像，然而偶像本身卻是不能自生自滅的，因為偶像在客觀上根本是一個不存在的空虛（non,existent　void），換句話說，是根本沒有的，卽是有，也不過是人腦中的一個概念。人類把他的概念形象化了變為神，所以神，不過是人的心靈的玩的一種花樣，在安慰他客觀的缺陷而己。</p>
<p>總之是人類創造神，而不是神創造人類。有人也許講，在任何社會中，只看到祭司跪在神座下，替神說教，替神服役，似乎他是神的奴隸，而惟神的命是聽，事實上是神聽命於祭司，祭司為主宰，而神為奴隸。他借助於神的說教，以達到他的目的。（如果神而有知，他定會暴怒起來，首先殛死他祭司。）原始社會中，祭司成為一特殊階級，支配著其他人，卽是執兵器的武士，也受他的支配。其後社會稍進化，武士階級雖代祭司執政權，然而祭司階級雖失去了他們的部分的勢力，然而在他方面，他卻得著武士們的特殊優待，因為武士階級也知道這服役於神的祭司，在某種方面，有特殊用處的。所以一直到現在，在野蠻社會中，以及那些號稱為文明的社會中，武士與祭司仍相互的執著政權。神對於祭司們自然有其特殊妙用，而極端擁護偶像的人們，自然也是這批祭司們。講到他們是否真實地信仰，那又是另一個問題。不過假使有人舉起手來想把那偶像推倒，那末他就要以衛護正教者自居，起來擁護了。就拿基督教來講，先前是羅馬人起來屠殺基督教徒，後來是基督教徒自己來把他們所謂異端者釘在十字架上，或用積薪焚死。又到了後來是他們自己互相火併，舊教徒殺新教徒，新教徒殺舊教徒，殘殺了一世紀，舊的偶像固然有了改變，新的偶像也被抬出，大家息手了。其實在這兩方面的後面，都有著武士們與祭司們在作崇，都是借偶像以達到他們所求的目的。戳穿了都是這麼一回事。</p>
<p>在二十世紀的今日，在科學的三稜鏡下，大概總可以用不著神的偶像了吧！然而未嘗沒有人做祭司的夢，雖則有人已經舉起了手。這在社會學上，呌做蠻性的遺留。</p>
<h3>關於［吳下諺聯］和著者王北荘先生</h3>
<p>— 朱馨谷</p>
<p>讀陳君子展［再談吳下諺聯］一文，不禁使我引起［我思古人］－我們的鄉先輩王伯荘先生。先生住邑之觀型堂鎮楊家荘。據陳君的推想，以為他［用素箋題一門聯：普天率土含悲處，復旦重華仰頌時。聯尾自署青浦素史臣王有光，大約他是由一個翰林出身，得過清朝的好處，感激涕零，那是當然的。……王老先生究竟做過什麼官呢？我想在青浦縣志裹，總可以找到。……］但，卻使人出乎意料之外，王老先生，原來是個諸生。青浦縣志文苑傅載道：</p>
<p>王有光，字觀國，諸生。從唐鼻戴駿龐薛鼎銘游。性穎悟，通經史，能以古事參處今事；四方就質疑義，無虛日。弟子最著者，黃金鐘陸企照程爘徐淵董用賓，皆蜚聲癢序。居北楊荘！楊維禎別墅也！有梅數百本，吟哦其下，澄心淡慮，人稱北荘先生……</p>
<p>然而北荘先生的著作，除［吳下諺聯］一書已刋之外，尚有未刋本甚夥，如［素史］［百物志］［北荘清話］等書，現在，祇存書名而已。</p>
<p>據我鄉顧倜羣先生告我：［步香先生！名之勳，北荘先生之曾孫！生前曾談及，北荘先生的著述，經洪楊之亂後，皆已散佚無存，惜哉！］</p>
<p>北荘先生，本一介寒儒，課館度日，絕無馀資刻書，［吳下諺聯］的所以能夠存在，還是經他的弟子陸企照我嵩父子的力量，捐資刋印。現在，該書板本，尚藏在先生後裔處。</p>
<p>北荘先生的軼事，至今還相傅為趣談，我鄉有一諺語：［撒屎不揩（讀如捒之去聲）臀，楊家荘裹人。］這便是說北荘先生的當時情況，在他撰［吳下諺聯］的時候，正是費寢忘食，有一次，方如廁，偶然想到一聯，急忙取紙筆錄下，便忘掉大便後還沒揩臀呢。因此可想見北荘先生著［吳下諺聯］一書，的是［精誠所至］哩。</p>
<h3>比蘭台羅的戲劇</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>今年的諾貝爾文學獎金決定授與意大利有名的劇作家兼小說家比蘭臺羅（piaendello，suigi）氏了。他有［意大昨的莫泊桑］的異名，這並不是他採取莫泊桑的文學方法，乃是他像莫泊桑一樣，是短篇小說（conte）作家，多產且又優秀的緣故。</p>
<p>比蘭臺羅如始終是小說家，則恐怕只是一個國內作家，沒有得這次這樣的榮冠的機會吧。到年垂五十（一九一七年）他突然轉變為戲曲，他的劇本在各國變成在戰後最可觀的存在，他的名字遂開始為世界所認識。處女劇作是［請隨尊意］，一九二一年作的［六個找尋作家的登塲人的］（中文有徐霞村譯本，水沫版）一出，始一躍而為歐洲劇作家的中心。最初介紹此書者是萊因哈爾特，但更真實的上演是翌年巴黎的彼得愛夫戲院。由於此劇的大衝動，差不多巴黎全部前衛演劇家都和他是握手，以至出現一九二五年的［比蘭強羅時代］。這是意味著他五個劇本的同時競演，特別是意味著傑作［亨利四世］之壓倒的成功。</p>
<p>沒有一國像法國那樣鑑賞他，愛寵他。他最活動的舞臺是在法國；有最多的文學友人的也是法國。影響現代法國文學最深者，一是杜斯妥也夫斯基，二就是他。有才能的批評家潘查克里苗是他的繙譯者，或者也是一因。傾向於普萊斯特（marcel　proust　1871-1922），范勒里（paul　anioroisevalery1871）或弗羅伊德主義的當時的文學感情，無疑地是成為歡迎他的適時素地。所謂比蘭臺羅主義，一方面是指他的文學的認識方法，一方面是指作為演劇問題的他的演劇學。作劇上的比蘭臺羅主義，既已在通俗劇都看出其姿態地，有了強力的影響。這是與立體主義（cubism）入音樂舞臺是同樣的理由。他的作劇術如何強健新鮮，也成為旁證。在這個意味上的比蘭臺羅主義，我想加以多少的考察。</p>
<p>比蘭臺羅的演劇，和易卜先及蕭伯納同稱屬思想劇，但他的興味全是非社會的，在意識與認識的問題上大有不同。他自稱為一哲學的作家，［使與一歷史的作家］對立（克里苗［享利四世］序文）。他全部作品，可說把［form］的問題終結於哲學。</p>
<p>六個登塲人物為著求得完成而去找尋作者，享利四世與諱名的狂人最快愈而再希望成為亨利四世。［祼體與衣服］，［形式與生活］，［理想與現實］，［狂亂與正氣］，［意識與認識］，他的主題莫不求之於這些關係的葛籐之中。在這樣的意味上，稱他為哲學的是恰當，但應注目其顯露至［人情底的］的作家態度。在他之中藏著［form］與［實］的相克。</p>
<p>作劇上的比蘭臺羅主義當然不能與那些思想的特徵分離。在一切近代劇作家中，像他那樣非常關心舞臺的可能性或演劇之動的效果的作家恐怕沒有吧。他是所謂反文學的作家，尚動作，重視舞臺裝置，在這兒有演劇的現代主義者的立塲。他的戲曲之臺本的特質是非常強的。有不安（suspense）的連續，chromatic的呈露，使人感到偵探小說的，俗劇（melodrama）的煽情。加之他熱知劇塲的機能，強度地考慮觀客的演劇參加力，從舞臺拓展到觀客度的事屢屢有之。各大各說是其通例，登塲人物與觀客席為伍。在六人上，無背景與扮裝的媒介，觀客直接與赤裸的舞臺及演員個人會面。撤廢第四壁的意志之如此徹底，確未見類例。在［亨利四世］中，在表演時演員自身把大道具都搗毀散亂完了。觀客在觀客席是愚蠢的，連在劇塲裹也不能不懷疑。</p>
<p>但是比蘭臺羅主義不單是終結於舞裹的技巧（trick）。是把［舞臺與觀容］，［演劇與現實］，［優伶與登塲人物］，［大道具與實物］等關係，直接結合於他的［form］與［實］的哲學之產物。他驚異的地驅使舞臺的機能，這可達到演劇的目的同時達到哲學的目的之點，尤可注意。大道具，幕，衣裳，在他都各各成為哲學的對象。這樣來思考演劇，使發生他的作劇術的。作意與作劇術之到達如此的直接結合之例，可說完全絕無。哲學具象化於演劇，亦少見其例。要之，因為舞臺受與從來完全不同的處理而生出眩惑，乃被稱為［西西里魔術師］之原因。但演劇的近代精神，決不以他為異端。可以說是最端正地代表戰後劇的大傾向的作家。（十一月十二十三日朝日新聞巖田豊雄：比蘭臺羅的演劇）</p>
<h3>箱子蓋上</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>到那麼一個小鎮上來過教書匠生涯，已是半個月多；平日寫作的時間，也從此完了。課間想偷閒看點兒書，又沒有安靜地方，但是成天兒不翻點書，像日子終難挨過似的。</p>
<p>一到晚上，常是一個人住宿校中，房間沿著河，很靜寂，河灘邊常有好多條販賣東西的船泊著，好月亮的夜，聽舟子在月光的河上扯閒話，哼傷感的歌調，在這悄靜的黃昏的境界中，我想自家幹點夜課吧！</p>
<p>然而，房間內，沒一條桌子，所帶的幾冊書，又佔了半張椅子，看書寫字，全無著落，但是我想出一個很寬大的桌子來了。把隨身跟來的一隻破皮箱兒，利用一下吧！擱到一條闊板凳上，箱子蓋上那麼平坦坦的，比椅子面寬大多了。</p>
<p>於是箱子蓋是我書案啦！</p>
<p>黃昏上點上一盞煤油燈，把嗽口盅合倒下來做燈座子，燈罩上加上一個反光的紙罩子，再燃下個煙蒂兒，就默默的伏到這箱子蓋的書案上做我的夜課了。</p>
<p>每夜上把一天精力賣乏了的身體再伏到箱子蓋上去。</p>
<p>夜窗，孤燈，孤寂窮困的異鄉人，凄涼地，人生的悲涼味兒，也浮在這境界裹了。</p>
<p>深夜，窗外邊月亮移過了河心，街頭的狗吠聲，繼續的起落著，在窗口偶而有一個年老的路人拖著鞋跟遲遲的誓過去，咯咯的打咳聲一同地。</p>
<p>我合下書，放著筆桿子，伸下兒腰，眼珠兒痛到再支不住，把身子伏到箱子蓋上去，精神是疲乏透了。</p>
<p>一上床，第一個心念想到的！！</p>
<p>不知何時發給第一個月的八折薪水？</p>
<p>一，一四，浦荘</p>
<h3>江湖客（十一）</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>他搖幌著，站立不穩的樣子。小二扶持他的肩胛，打斷他：</p>
<p>［你喝多了，［良心］……還有明兒咧。］</p>
<p>［不，我不醉］他掙脫小二的手。［乾乾…唔，可是毒害過人命嗎，香莩？有些人，你看，不是拏毒藥當白糖賣嗎？正是！誰又指明他是殺人（的）賊？沒有一人！…白糖，哎，白糖！白糖的毒藥我破了。乾乾……」</p>
<p>他幾乎摔在桌下。小二拉住他的胳膊。</p>
<p>［明天乾，老朋友！明天。］</p>
<p>他低下頭，搖著微坍的膀光，手節緊著桌子，哼出一支歌來。</p>
<p>［喝喝，喝呀！］頭掛在脊梁上，嘴角流著白沫。掙扎著，終於倒在椅上。［喝……喝多啦多啦！酒是要命東西哪，酒！……］</p>
<p>像野狗哭似的，他大聲呻吟著了。</p>
<p>香莩賣者和天氣一樣霉氣，他遭兩個！！也許還多的人搥打了。</p>
<p>剛落過雨的車站土埠下，滿是泥濘和小水潦，閒散和不閒散的人踏來踏去，發出喞喞的沾風聲。不時有哄笑騰出，顯然已觀望好久，尚有著甚麼不滿足。一時沒有散閒的意思。</p>
<p>兇手已經逃了。［香莩］從泥淖裹爬起，灰布大褂被扯作幾條，滿浸了泥漿和水，血由額際流出，塗在那巖石塊的臉上，混合著泥污。流在不潔的鬍子上轉動著，滴落在水泊裹，泛起紅暈，就雲霧似的散了。</p>

<h3>江角續漲銅元回縮</h3>
<p>昨江南小洋、早市為八百二十八元、午市為八百三十一元八角、結果　前日續漲三元八角、交　　面、午市　出七千角、早市則無聞、廣東小洋、早市為七百四十八元一角、午市為七百四十八元二角、結果　前日僅好二角、游出交易、早市十四萬角、午市九萬角、　元為三百十七千文、較前日回小一千五百元、交易數額三萬六千四百七十五　文、含代價洋一萬一千五百元、</p>
<h3>證劵洋拆日高債券市況變動倐忽</h3>
<p>震盪終日漲跌互見</p>
<p>金短高惟六角五分</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、因洋拆忽掛二角一分、人心又虛、初跌頗厲、後又以劃頭見縮、補空回漲、趨勢瞬息即有變化、投機份子、疲於奔命、惟據金融界言、洋拆暫時未必見縮、一則以現金流出、再則以內地商業活動、運用現金頗湧、上海存底減少、洋拆尚有續高可能、目下已屆交割相近時、洋拆適於此時頗有升降、故價市波動、亦隨之震邊不已、昨日趨勢、稍有軋多之狀、上午開盤、賣氣已盛、三十五號賣出最湧、二十一及價驟跌一二角至六角半、此完全受洋拆高漲至二角一分之影響、次盤即起回風、亦係猛跌之反響、回上五分一角至三角半、午後聞劃頭祇做一角二三分、因此洋拆或不致再高、趨勢頓有改變、頭盤前列略小一二角左右、後列自統稅起、漸漸向上、尚好起一二角、人心頓又稍定、收盤聞時局消息良佳、三十五號止賣、市價漸漸趨漲、愈漲愈勁、入後金短猛漲六角半、市價結果、亦不一致、前列小一二角至四角半、市價紹果、亦不一致、前列小一二角至四角半、後列自統稅起逐漸向上、金短猛漲六角半、趨勢以遠期為佳、多頭亦頗有掉期、成交總數、計共約在二千萬元左右、茲將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左（單位元）</p>
<h3>紗花接連下跌五天後標紗突然高騰</h3>
<p>連跌五日之紗市、今則突然轉漲、因某公司在近月有決意收貨說、彌漫市塲、同時金價趨高、致人心愈挺、一般浮空活動抵補、市盤乃愈開愈緊、但多頭方面之舉動、仍在他號進彼號出、且額量頗鉅云、</p>
<p>本月紗收貨說熾</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美印棉市平疲、塲中市氣稱定、但本月份多頭方面仍拉緊不放、各月漲一。二。三。四角、午後市上傅說某公司收貨之說極盛、買風更熾、而金價漲風又起、因之市價愈開愈緊、各月均漲八。九角至一元四角、金日成交統計三萬六千五百包、查賣出吉豊六百五十包、大豊六百五十包、錦昌七百包、同興五百包、顧大六百五十包、元一四千二百五十包、益昶八百五十包、同孚六百五十包、源大一千包、元德五百包、買惟穗降四百包、吉豊二千二百五十包、大孚六百包、通記二千零五十包、明德六百五十包、賡豊二千包、昶記五百包、泰興八百包、瑞大一千包、長豊一千零五十包、信誠七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現紗做開一千包強</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚好、查全日各少買去統計一千零三十包、行情漲五角、各幫買額如下、</p>

<h3>期花人氣後市轉好</h3>
<p>棉市晨平午漲、形勢又見挺秀、但海外棉市狀況依然衰弱、詎紏午後聞金債又漲至一千元左右、同時紗市趨漲、棉市人心亦被其激動、空頭抵補尤急、而漲四解半、</p>
<p>鄭標回張四角</p>
<p>獲棉前市開盤、因外棉依然軟化、塲中市況平平、但拍至收盤時略轉昂勢、結果近月不動、遠跌五分至一角半、午後開盤突緊、形勢甚硬、因金價漲風又起、接近一千元關口、故人心大為良好、買氣心足、各月均漲三四角、全日成交統計七萬七千五百擔、查賣出大孚一千一百擔、吉豊二千三百擔、大豊一千六百擔、均昶三千六百擔、遠大四千七百擔、益康二千五百擔、通記二千八百擔、源大三千九百擔、錦昌一千擔、益豊一千擔、買進大豊二千二百擔、大孚二千二百擔、穗降二千一百擔、明德一千四百擔、仁豊一千一百擔、同和一千七百擔、源興昌一千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>外廠採現漸勤</p>
<p>現棉銷路尚活動、外商進胃漸開、來源計姚花一千一百七十八包、通花九百六十五包、</p>
<p>靈寶花　六二。五○　同興廠進　一六四件　現貨送廠　天津美種花　五五。四○　上海廠進　一○○件　現貨送廠　靈寶花　五五。一○　裕豊廠進　八二件　現貨送廠</p>
<h3>天津紗花銷清市平</h3>
<p>津訊、本市棉紗客銷轉滯、高陽帶買三十二支八馬紗十包、價開二百二十二元、香河幫買十六支八馬紗三十包、價開一百七十六元半、（統稅在內）</p>
<p>又西河花市況暗澹無神、各方購辦甚呆、洋商進胃吸收並不見暢、祇西商買進二百包、開價為三十五元五角、其他未有成交云、</p>
<h3>美印棉市之回顧</h3>
<p>十七日紐約棉市內、一大現貨行家收買十二月份、而拋出遠期、開盤時稍有套賣與了結、惟利物浦電訊良好、故未發生任何影響、但一般購買不力、消息又復沉寂、價格略跌、現貨異常緊張、故當十二月份浮多了結清浄後、市價可期上升、目下交易者觀望不前、正在等候政府對於明年收成限止之新發展、市價已見昨報、</p>
<p>上週孟買棉市堅昂、投機家買進、因日本及歐洲之需要擴大、運輸商亦有買進、中國漸有進意、惟本地廠家因待新棉之湧至、殊不活動、目下新棉走動未增、賣戶無從壓迫、故甚礎價格、仍能保持在水平綫以上、布疋實銷、據報尚稱滿意、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<p>一九三三年　一九五四年</p>
<p>九月一日起收數累計　九八　一三五　週琳現存　五五一　五六九　九月一日起出口累計　一二五　一八三　輸往歐洲　八二　六六　輸往中國　四一　一○　輸往日本　－　一○二　其他各地　二　五</p>
<h3>糧食粉麥已見回漲</h3>
<p>粉市昨日上午開盤後、由定轉挺、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好一二角左右、坎拿大近期不動、遠好四分左右、當開價時、以賣氣已靜、各廠方面、亦多觀望、本月份之回籠貨生意、則頗熱鬧、傅營口安東等處、半因封河已近、半因加稅問題、連日動裝頗急、因此各月份人心、平靜之中、遂帶俏利也、迨至下午開盤、本月份以客幫仍有抽裝、廠方亦略有抵補、遠期各月份、交易未見暢旺、惟以新空甚少、業外心思、仍然堅勁、故市氣又一致良好也、結果本月份回漲二分半、十二月份漲二分半、一月份漲二分、二月份漲二分、一釐半、三月份漲二分、四月份漲一分七釐半云、</p>
<p>麥市開價時、以拋戶見稀、業中人心思、微見帶緊、市塲方面、因國麥存量步少、拋戶當然難湧、此進非有洋麥做籌碼、前途發展當然為難、故欲過落、亦覺不易、下午各盤、交易仍清、價呈平穩、較上午無甚上落、結果本月份較好二分、十二月份好四分、一月份好三分、二月份好一分、三月份好三分、現麥市況、高貨仍穩、中次帶軟一二分、開山車白麥三元八角二分、紅麥三元八角、瑤灣麥三元七角九分、江北麥三元七角半、計二千包、由阜豊辦去云、</p>
<p>支加哥雜糧市況向上、傅澳麥有損害、美國西南赴仍旱、迄未得雨、收成消息雖劣、然國外市況疲弱、小麥遂不能上漲、交易清凈、但因玉米到貨稀少、且無拋售、緊強有力、小麥亦得、相當助力、而見略漲、然一般以為價茍續漲、或將引起國外糧食之進口、</p>
<h3>各米來源轉旺</h3>
<p>斛價　降：陰元獨漲</p>
<p>糧米　昨日滬南各業來源三十馀號、（貨共近五千石）、銷塲呆木、人心異常虛弱、客幫包胃、有寗波　動辦百馀包、及北洋煙臺等種續進四五百包、惟剔選奇嚴、屬意高料之貨、吃盤獨緊、各色晚稻續跌一二角、厚糧小角馀不等、僅蘇同幫粳因到源有限、尚未跟小、杜洋尖容尖不景氣象已成、相隨下游二角許、至若陰元為酒戶幫在內地大事搜買、致貨源抵埠者察若展星、人心緊昂、市色獨俏、至滬北各地到船二十馀號、河存一百四五十艘、市銷方面、新粳破粳新羊杜埠尖等均清淡、陳白元因客元到多銷呆、薄稻勒價略有交易、客尖平淡、新粳高料小角外、中次小二角、薄稻小一二角、新羊尖杜尖小一角、陳白元小二三角、破糧客尖平　、</p>
<p>客秈　來源見多、人心趨下、查昨日新到湘米有二萬四千五百包之多、尚有一萬五六千包已在途中、幸內地去化尚活、價低小角許至二角、全日開出各秈四千五百包、多數為內地辦去、</p>
<p>洋米　昨受客秈影響、亦帶小五分、且定貨日上可到、後形甚　、期米月永大等兜售、昨日回籠米已小五分、新交易尚在擯持中、惟暹邏元米為本街內地爭辦、昨日　獨漲一角、全日開出只有一百包、蓋市上存到兩少也、期米共計八百五十噸、現西貢等共計一千包云、</p>
<h3>黃荳到貨仍不繼</h3>
<p>－上千未已－</p>
<p>昨日黃荳市比較週六又漲五六分、刻下腳地頗穩、蓋因車運不接、輪運祇河南貨續到、但為數不多、大運牛荘產價高而到頭亦少、致市面又見上騰、廢家辦荳胃口見濃、故到之存枯之頴州陳荳、更覺俏俐、昨市開自三元四角四至三角半、成交十三四車、去路為廠家及錫常油坊歸德新荳成交一千三百馀包、價自三元三角半至三角、亦為錫常及本街辦去、尚有新安鎮新荳成交七百馀包、價目三元二角九至二角六、亦為錫常本街之胃、其馀各荳共交易八百馀包、由本街及客戶採去云、</p>
<h3>絲茶路荘珍眉歐銷暢達</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋荘茶市、婺源屯溪遵安等路之珍眉綠茶、英商協和怡和福時等行、均因國外來電需求、茶價不大、據實仍不遺馀力、全市感交七　馀　、婺滬高荘貨、頂盤做開八十四元、屯溪貨、售開六十八元、遂安貨、售開五十元、驚上星期均無上落、惟計總賣　絲茶等花色、莫　　　等荘、謂有零星談判、但因國外米價緊縮、未有成交、形勢頗為呆廠、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　紹笑遠迎挑燈照憔悴饑腸驅迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>當胡嫂子那樣拒絕賈多才的時候，這小西天一個最工心計的茶房呌小紀的，正在一邊閑看著，他這就向胡嫂子笑道：喂！你是窮瘋了嗎？胡嫂子正因賈多才說了他兩句，氣不過，身子也站不住，手扶了院子門，向賈多才的去路望著，於今見小紀也來說他，便瞪了眼道：窮到窮，瘋可不瘋，老娘心裹，比你們這娃娃明白。小紀冷笑道：你還說你明白呢，一個人無論如何，也不會得罪財神爺吧？你知道剛才這位賈先生幹什麼的，他可是銀行裹的人呢。他那洋錢，真是用把抓。胡嫂子向小紀週身打量打量，看他是不是撒謊，沉吟著道：憑他那個樣子，會是銀行裹的人？小紀道：銀行裹的人怎麼樣？臉上都貼著鈔票嗎？胡嫂子笑道：不是那話，我想銀行裹的人，一定都是福福氣氣的，頭也大，臉也圓，這個人可是個瘦子。小紀舉起右手，將中指和拇指夾住了一彈，對著胡嫂子臉上拍的一下響，笑道：你少誇自己知道事吧？如今有錢的人，不像從前，長得胖豬一樣了，他們日夜想著，怎樣的在錢上掙錢，人都想瘦了。越是大有錢的人，現在倒越容易瘦。胡嫂子笑道：這樣說，你也該有十萬八千，你不是很瘦嗎？小紀正了臉色低聲道：我並不是說笑話，這位賈先生，實在的有錢，你現在不是替你那親戚，要找個有錢的主嗎？他也正有心想在西安找一個人，你們兩下裹兩好湊一好，正是好不過的事，為什麼把他得罪了。（六八）</p>
<h3>金山尋墓記</h3>
<p>— 一震</p>
<p>偶然翻閱［金山志］，看見一段很好的史料，是敘述一個民族英雄的故事：［徐明山呂巷鎮之泖灣人，明永嘉時，倭人自金山衛登陸，入寇松屬，而金山首當其衝，蹂躝尤甚。倭以路徑不諳，拘明山為向導，明山虛與委蛇：會天寒甚。倭不慣，苦之。明山獻策，謂江南稻草，勝于棉絮；倭人令為之所，明山擇大廈，建草舍使倭聚處其中，倭樂甚。一日歡飲，明山潛出縱火，四周盡著，倭人千數，無一逃生。］</p>
<p>我因為呂巷有朋友，便搭船前往，一方面去看看朋友，一方面把這件事探問個究竟。到了那裹，和金君談起了這個故事，他也沒有知道，他說：［泖灣就在我們鎮之東北七八里，高興我們去走走吧！］次晨我們兩個便步行走去，想訪問徐義土的墳墓和他的生前詳情。</p>
<p>失望！大半天我們還不能得到一些另外的消息。後來從該地的一個在家老道土處得到一些。徐明山是泖涇鄉人，為人放蕩不覊，沒有一定職業，到處流浪。性喜杯中物，每飲輒醉，醉後分外放肆，當地歌謠中之［買酒要請徐明生］就是這個出典。徐氏自從殺敵後，要現瘋態，半年後，醉死。徐氏的墳墓已經不可調查，他的後裔也不知所在。</p>
<p>最近，省教育廰通知該鄉，以徐義士之事蹟，採作小學的國語教本的補充讀物。並令民衆機關，以這件事蹟的始末，立碑記念。徐義士泉下有知，亦可聊以自慰了。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （基爵）</p>
<p>約法上標明了男女在法律上一律平等，但內外親等的規定不同，以及禁止堂兄弟姊妹的結婚，而不禁姑表之間的聯姻，似乎仍末解除［男性中心］的故習。</p>
<p>［姦淫未滿十四歲的女子，以強姦論］。然則姦淫十四歲零一天的女子，不算強姦子，不算強姦了。所以說法律是死的東西，誠不能規範到避法犯法的人。</p>
<h3>四個朋友速寫</h3>
<p>— 琢</p>
<p>逕啟者：鄙人有四個朋友，他們都各有其環境，個性，所以人生觀也不相類同。原擬替他們各人造一幀象，因某種關係（這句是大衆辭典上檢出來的）。不果。這裹姑且速寫幾筆。</p>
<p>一個朋友有些［黃衫客］的遺風，喜歡管閑事，打抱不平，可是他也有他的宗旨。往往一件小事情，經他參與之後，保管事態擴大，［一日千里］，僥倖獲得最後勝利，他當然是功臣，一旦感到事情棘手，他便轉風使舵，顯出他的主義來，掉頭不再管事了。甚至他還埋怨別人：［同你們這班人幹事，不會有好結果的］</p>
<p>一個朋友藹然可親，嘴犄角上時常浮著微笑，從沒有疾言厲色的時候。遇人也一視同仁，兩鬢如霜的丐者，向他伸手，他照例不給錢；但他不是為富不仁的人，他說：［你這樣年邁了，為什麼還要東闖西撞，不在家裹享享清福呢？］遇見同一階級的人，他對什麼都沒有批評，一切都是［好！好！］卽使人家背著牆隅如厠，他也會向人說：［你撒尿時的姿勢，真有詩意！］</p>
<p>一個朋友非常工心計，他慣在陰面攻訐人家，說話的藝術又高明，在人前他是應酬得面面俱到，一團和氣，誰知這人蓄心，竟是一團別氣呢！此外，他又有特殊技巧能使人雙方衝突，又能天天吃人家的酒飯，不讓人惹氣，而且願意同他親近。祇是奇怪，他雖豪於飲，而每飲輒醉，酒帳總是別人會鈔的；不遇人家遺忘在桌上的高貴的香煙，他倒瞧得清楚，每次順手帶走了。</p>
<p>一個朋友是文質彬彬的斯文人，雖然讀書不多，卻學會了一些［下流才子］的皮毛，也喜歡弄弄琵琶，或則拉了壽器店的帳房先生，下一局象棋。於寫字，他天賦獨厚，好一手顏魯公的字體，居然磅磚有奇氣！他的芳鄰三好婆看見他習字，總贊他方方正正，又粗又大！去歲廢曆年底，特地買了一張梅紅紙，裁一為二，恭恭敬敬請他寫春聯。居然蒙他金諾，毫不思索，一揮而就，聯曰：［物華天寶日，人傑地靈時。］</p>
<h3>小茶館</h3>
<p>— 朱瘦桐</p>
<p>二三十戶人家的鄉村裹，大概總有著一所小茶館；同樣是用稻草蓋的屋子，不過在外面簽下，懸掛著一塊斗大紅色［茶］字的油溙方形招牌，引起人們的注意。屋子裹邊的陳設，也十分的簡陋，幾隻桌子，四周圍放了長橙。茶具當然談不到精美和素雅，完整一點，沒有缺口或是裂痕，已經僅見的了。</p>
<p>茶客盡是附近一帶的農人，目的並不在於解渴，藉此進來休息一回，也有想找個熟人談天。有時偶有提了籃子，呌買香煙，花生，瓜子及糖食等類東西的小販經過，更是投著他們的所好了。</p>
<p>在這裹，時間也消失了它的價值。他們都是悠然自得，毫沒有急促的神情。閒坐半天，也算不得怪。有的無聊到極點的當兒，伏在桌上瞌睡，一覺醒來，已經夕陽西下，方才懶洋洋的回去。</p>
<p>窗上鑲的不是玻璃，都糊著白紙，經歷了常久的風吹日曬，已變作灰白色，因之屋裹異常的陰暗。茶爐邊的那盞油燈，忍不住微風輕拂，時常搖搖欲滅，氛裹，似乎格外的靜寂起來。這一點，確能使人感受到詩的意味。</p>
<p>小園藝</p>
<h3>花果小品</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>一剪秋羅</p>
<p>秋花爛歲，不襄春色，剪秋羅其一也，一名剪秋紗，又名漢宮秋，為多年生草。葉似剪春羅，莖高二三尺，叢生細毛，仲秋著花，有白及深綘淺江三色，瓣分數歧，尖峭可愛，花時甚久，秋盡猶開。性喜陰，春分後分裁，植於沃土，灌以清泉，不可曝於烈日中。若下子種，則將稻秧置監其上，以防暴雨。別有一種花，作黃色者，曰剪金羅，亦殊艷茂。或謂皆萱花之附庸。</p>
<p>摘剪秋羅葉搗爛之，和以蔴油，可以治癬。此友人許仲周為予道者，謂甚有效也。</p>
<p>維揚校書蔣茝香，性風雅，能詩詞，喜與名流往來，而於詩詞中輒黨惟悴自傷之意。有翦秋羅一絕云：［幾輩零落夕陽中，冷蕊疏枝也自紅，莫效輕羅作團扇；恐隨漢苑棄秋風］。作楚楚可憐語，讀之令人銷魂無已。</p>
<p>二文竹</p>
<p>竹饒淇澳之趣，具凌雲之既。然亦有婆婆而矮，為書齊清供者，厥為文竹，乃竹之別種，盆植數竿，便生渭川之想。湘中記云：［高平縣有文竹山，上有石床，四面綠竹扶疏，隨風委拂此床。按高平，即今之新化縣也］。</p>
<p>玉峯胡石予師，喜栽文竹，曾謂：［文竹幽秀深碧，望之如新繤成林，疏密參差，風致自媚，乃盆景之佳者。惟栽之不得其法，則過於修長，易致欹斜，失美觀矣。欲其免此，夜不宜露，不露則不至過長，又不宜置之牆側，牆下迴風迫壓，則欹斜不正。又有一法，栽時以風鑪灰夾人泥土中，則清滋有致，且免過長之病，鑪灰無資養分故也。大約土七灰三，最為適中。又宜用白油瓦盆，或白磁盆，取其與綠色相掩映耳。盆中或更配置小石，以成合景，案頭座石，養目之佳品也］。</p>
<p>我吳顧鶴逸，為盡苑祭酒，茲已歿世有年，鶴逸嘗書齊額為［楊梅文化之家］，驟視之以為指庭圃間垂紅密峯之點綴而言，實則不然，楊梅謂楊補之畫梅，文竹謂文與可畫竹，傅世真跡，為稀有之珍，而顧家收羅古書畫，竟得藏之，因以名耳。</p>
<p>三波羅蜜</p>
<p>果類中多甘汁者，西瓜椰子之外，當推波羅蜜為佳品，波羅蜜本為梵語，其養為度彼岸，謂由此岸而度登彼岸，離生死而人湼槃也。移為果名，始於明代，類函云：［明光祿寺甜食房，宦者掌之，專治糖果以供佛前，名波羅蜜］。</p>
<p>樹為常綠喬木，產於嶺南，及東印度等處。葉為倒卵形，花小，叢集成穗，實橢圓，多者每株結十馀枚，少者五六枚，外裹厚皮，多棘刺，每枚重可二三斤，剜去外皮，肉層疊如橘　。滬上果肆偶亦有售，最普通者，則為罐頭物中，宴飲之際，煮之為甜美，殊可口也。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我在長廊下流連了約莫有半小時模樣，漸漸地覺得疲倦起來了；因為第一層原因，今天我自己的確也累得很辛苦了，事實上真有安息一會的需要：第二層原因，像這樣獨自冷冰冰地的在廊下站著，也未免太枯寂此；於是我就走進了我自己的寢室，躺下床去，打算做一個短短的甜夢。可是合上了眼，偏又睡不熟，只能矇矇朧朧地假寐著；待到快要真正的睡熟了，忽又給一個宮女走來把我喚醒，告訴我說太后已在翻身了，不消幾分鐘工夫，伊一定會醒過來，所以這宮女忙特地趕來通知我，好讓我立刻穿起衣服來準備端整，待伊一醒，便馬上走進去侍候。</p>
<p>太后果然在十分鐘之後便醒了，伊老人家也少不得又要梳洗穿紥一番；這樣，時候已是不早了。經不起伊再和我們隨便說了一會閑話，晚膳的時間已到，於是日常的那一套繁文褥節又開始了；照例那多得不合實用的一百碗正菜，便蜂擁似的端將出來，彷佛和開什麼展覽會一般的舖滿在太后的面前。我簡直是見了就害的，可是習慣如此，無論在北京的皇宮裹，或頣和園裹，或御用列車上，地點儘管不同，這一百碗菜總是每餐所必備的：如今到了奉天，當然也不能獨免。</p>
<p>晚飯過後，大家仍在太后的便殿上聚著，伊對於這一處新的環境，倒像並不如何注意，不但不想秉燭夜遊，簡直說話中也不見提起，彷彿是伊老人家根本沒有到過奉天一樣。（一七八）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>複議中新刑法通姦罪</h3>
<p>— 皮</p>
<p>立法院此次通過刑法草案第二百三十九條，［有夫之婦與人通奸者，處一年以下有期徒刑，其相奸者亦同。］惟有婦之夫，與人通奸，則法無科罪之規定，以致引起娘子軍大興問罪之師。</p>
<p>茲悉中央政治會議，業經通過，依照男女平等原則，交立法院複議。至其將來複議之結果如何，頗為全國人士所注目，據可靠方面的消息，複議的結果，不出兩途。</p>
<p>一為有夫之婦，或有婦之夫與人通奸者，同等科罪，（惟後者為顧全事實上之困難起見，必須加以附文。）</p>
<p>二有夫之婦或有婦之夫與人通奸者，均不科罪。</p>
<p>據我的意見，第一途雖則同等科罪，而後者必須加以附文，此與平等之中仍有不能完全平等之意，不若採用第二主張，較為直捷痛快。</p>
<p>孟子曰，［食色性也。］孔子曰，［我未見好德者如好色者也。］則性的要求，卽聖賢亦所不免，並且性的要求，男女亦同一須要，原不能盡責諸男子，也不能盡責諸女子。原來此種事件，本是生理上的一種秘密，也是造化小兒故弄狡乘，本來算不得一種駭人聽聞的事情。</p>
<p>自古人定出了一種婚姻制度，所謂［三從四德］所謂［從一而終］宋儒又變本加厲，所謂［餓死事不上，失節事大］等等，而夫婦之間，從此多事矣。</p>
<p>卽以事實言之，專制婚姻，主重法律，而自由婚姻，主重道德，凡男女的一方，茍與人通奸，則對於法律上的責任，雖無可逃，而對於道德上的責任，更無可逭。但是鼠竊狗偷的事，倘若加以仔細考查，恐尚不止如王博士所云有十分之二三以上。所以性的問題，只有聽其自生自滅，不必於法律上強加裁制。</p>
<p>並且有夫之婦，或有婦之夫，既與人通奸，則對於本夫或本妻的感情，既經淡薄，自不必言，只有雙方脫離了關係，否亦聽其自然，最為直捷爽快的事，故古人云，［妻子如衣服，兄弟如手足。］［你愛誰去跟誰］到也兩得其便。</p>
<p>世界婚姻的製度，原沒有一定的，有多妻制的，也有多夫制的。如南洋某地，有兄弟多人合娶一妻者，而某處也有所謂典生子的習慣者，（例如甲的妻，可租與乙若干年，乙方出租金若干，以便生子。）此種情形，多因時代的不同，和社會的組織而定其方式。僅恃法律的裁制，原無多大的效力也。</p>
<p>並且婚姻既經絕對自由，則離婚也絕對自由，所以司法院前日所訂的離婚條件判例，異常寬大，其解釋云，所謂不堪同居之虐待云者，［不僅以身體為限，卽其精神上感有不堪同居之痛苦，亦以虐待論，］亦得離婚，何況夫妻的一方，而與人通奸，天然更有離異的必要。如此則法官省了許多麻煩，而夫婦之間，亦少卻許多糾葛不清的事，豊不是好。</p>
<h3>北平的色彩</h3>
<p>— 峰</p>
<p>－北平印象錄之二－</p>
<p>色彩是可以左右人的感情的，藍的安靜，白的純潔，紅的興奮，桃緋的柔媚；都是例子。</p>
<p>無論如何，北平是難於使人興奮的。記得俄國的盲目時人到北平時，曾嘆息過［真寂寞啊］的話，這話是不錯的。北平真寂寞，打個比喻，那真像一個曾經輝煌過一時的門第，如今卻只落下個空敝而近於荒蕪的院宇了。</p>
<p>如果拿北平來和一個中古的城堡或近代的都市比，我覺得北平像城堡而沒有多少近代都市的風味。人口雖有一百多萬，但這些人並不曾把北平現代化起來，高聳的洋房，沒有；煤煙氣息，沒有；忙得要撞個滿懷的人羣，沒有；在北平，人膠是安閒的，像白塔，像城樓；說來也有趣，北平的電車－－也許是太老太重的緣故產，我覺得也是安閒的。</p>
<p>每到下午四五句鐘的時候，我的院裹，真寂寞到可以聽見向日葵的老根吸水的聲音。斜陽透過小胡同，斜照在東房上，灰舊的房瓦，像個老人的眼睛在看我。推開窗簾，如果有小麻雀飛下院時，躁下腳便是很有趣的事，那嘆的一陣驚惶的飛，才真顯出小院的寂莫來。向日葵背過臉去，像不忍悵望著夕陽，而瓦房的馀暉，卻映得淡黃的花更顯寂寞。這時，聽胡同裹轔轔的車聲，那是鐵箍的輪，輾著坎坷的地面，捲灰塵而俱遠了。靠牆根的一聲呌賣，那猛可地一聲喊，有時真像古墓道裹墜下土來。一下抽鞭，拍！馀聲猶可在灰牆間反覆地回撞：一陣糖鑼，胡同裹定有個長長的人影在挪動，隨著又是孩子們的嚷嚷這一切，都是寂寞的，說北平是近代的都市吧！近代的都市是這樣的嗎？</p>
<p>北平的夜，是尤其寂寞的，十點左右，卽是最熱鬧的處所也會寥寂起來；那時，在大街上你可聽到人們咳嗽的聲音，人力車夫疲倦拖著車在哼著小調，遠遠的店舖上門聲；街燈下，冒著白煙，幾個賣力氣的人在圍著；大都市的夜，是不會這樣的</p>
<p>夜再深，梆聲，犬吠聲，火車咽嗚聲，便佔滿了寂寞的空間。</p>
<p>這不是個古城堡嗎？那麼安閒地，寂寞地。</p>
<p>表示這安閒和寂寞得近於頹廢的色彩，是灰暗的。</p>
<h3>平時不燒香急來抱佛脚</h3>
<p>— 潘湖昭</p>
<h3>爐畔</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>一鐵鏟一鐵鏟的煤粒子送進了爐灶裹，熊熊的火燄不住在往上冒，它彷彿像血一樣的股紅，黑的煤粒也變成了紅的火塊。爐傍站著的幾個人，都給燻灼得成了南菲洲土人那麼般的可怕，他們的血液，全給這一千幾百度的高熱熾乾了：油光烏黑的臉上，嵌鑲著一隻僅能翕動的嘴馬，和一對沒有力的白眼球。伸出來的手，像鐵一樣的黑，似柴一樣的乾。他們不論春天廈天或秋天冬天，總是鎮天的站在那隻爐灶邊，把一塊一塊或一條一條的鐵送進那隻爐裹，讓那熊熊的火熖把它灼著，再從紅得像血般的火燄子裹去掬出一塊塊的紅餅子來，放在鐵墩子上，於是每一個鐵鎚都在那</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>紅餅子上搥著。無數的火星在空中飛進，飛到牆上，飛到身上，甚至飛到他們的臉上。搥得它透不過氣來，值至紅的變了灰黑的纔歇，但接著又去打第二塊了。</p>
<p>他們的生命是沒棫的，終日生活在那堆滿灰煤的黑屋子裹，一隻爐灶便是他們的生活源泉，打了一整天的鐵，除了吃飯睡覺的時間外，幾乎連舒一口氣的機會都沒有。到了晚上，便將一個勞苦毒壞了的肢體，一骨碌扔進了那個骯髒的破被窩裹：這在他們是一天疲勞換來的特有代價－－唯一的安息。他們總以為自己是天生成的苦骨頭，能夠不餓肚子已經是很僥倖的啦！</p>
<h3>此時低頭下拜彼時踢你一腳</h3>
<p>— 董文淵</p>
<p>能屈能伸方是大丈夫，沒法的時候，鑽鑽狗洞，不愧是英雄本色，古來英雄丈夫，均以此達成功之途，所以當今之世能［此時低頭下拜彼時踢你一腳］者誠不乏其人的了。</p>
<p>因為在這如梯一般的社會裹，誰不想往上爬，然而爬得不好是要跌下來的，於是聰敏人便從事於研究此中秘密，而發明了爬梯術，也就是登龍之道，所謂爬梯術者，無非是：</p>
<p>－此時低頭下拜，彼時踢你一腳。</p>
<p>這就是在沒有辦法的此時，大丈夫大英雄們都得低頭行屈以求全，而從事於鑽狗洞而過生活，遇到有人伸出大腿要踢的時候，便跪著下拜，並苦苦的哀求道：</p>
<p>－可憐我！幫幫忙，讓我吃口飯。</p>
<p>要是那個收回大腿不再踢你的時候，便在狗洞裹鑽了進去，也就是爬上了一級梯子，於是從沒有飯吃的人變到有飯吃了，休息一下，又得向上望，在哀求，下拜，挨苦中又設法爬上一級，像這樣無止境的努力，一直到爬上梯的頂級，以達躍登龍門的目的為止。</p>
<p>但是當他在向上爬的時候，一邊就連帶做一種踢人的工作，只要上了第一級，馬上把第一級的踢去，而向第二級上的哀求，因為這樣一方面可以在自己爬的時省去了擠軋，另一方面又滅去了將來的後患，原來等他爬完梯子，梯子上的也早被踢光了，豈不是可以安安心心的神氣一輩子？</p>
<p>所以現在的人，要想成功大享便得學這一套，否則那裹還談得上什麼大丈夫和英雄？</p>
<p>像這種英雄丈夫，假使只有一個是不妨事，等到有了二個三個的話，那就簡直糟啦！你也鑽，我也鑽，你也踢，我也踢，社會就從此不得安寗，同時還苦了普通的一班人。</p>
<p>他們在社會上固有的地位被人佔去了，結果連吃口飯都會被人踢下來的。有時跌得頭破血淋，就此完結，而在梯子上的人卻拍掌大笑，得意忘形。</p>
<p>不知何年何日，另有一術取而代之。</p>
<h3>東西南北</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>小時候喜歡讀武俠小說，對於那些二道白光的人物真是心響往之，雖然沒有半夜裹起來從窗口上跳出去的實騐一番。</p>
<p>今年張武士學斌在大滬花園擺梅花椿，這是無論如何值得一看的，可是為了些小事一躭擱，就此失卻了［千載難逢］的機會，除了唸阿彌陀佛沒有辦法。</p>
<p>今晨讀報，發見幾方塊的［真正］梅花椿，上海人的眼福［真正］不淺。</p>
<p>張學斌的梅花椿是真是假，因為沒有親眼目覩，不能臆料。其實就是目覩了，不識貨的人等於瞎子，我們還是莫明其妙的。現在據這位藝界聞人的廣告，顯然是［真正老牌］了，自然先覩為快，毫無疑意。</p>
<p>記得不多時前［王先生］在中央上演，為了［親自登臺］，引起了誤會，後來在東南就自稱［冒牌］王先生，偶然與現在的［真正］梅花椿對比起來［真正］夠幽默的！</p>
<h3>行路散記</h3>
<p>— 金人</p>
<p>與上海這社會接觸以來，有相當的時候了，覺得要學習一點做人（在上海做人）的藝術，最好是跑到馬路上去，耳朶所聽到的，眼睛所見到的，決不是幾冊什麼ＡＢＣ之類所能及於萬一。</p>
<p>在軍車站上的煙兌店，兌換的價值永遠沒有像水牌上寫的那末多，而雜角雜洋都作為整個價格兌出去的。雖然到處有這種同類的事情發生，然而為何在電車站上獨多呢？而且每個人都能略略知道這種弊病，卻沒有人在這必要的時間內設法避免它。同時電車站上的乞丐也是特別多，他們的說好話藝術也使人驚奇，他們只要從對象的服飾舉動上，說恰得其當的好話，那樣純熟的背書似的，在某種人或者這類好話正是他所思念而沒有表示出來的；某種人對於他們的好話都有相當的經騐而麻煩起來，這樣類乎慷慨的一枚銅元正是他們所希望的。但對於這一件事還沒有到結果的時候，除非你所要等候的電車剛剛疾馳而來，否則，接踵而至，他們就能以你施與一個銅元的故事作為他說好話的根據，自然他是沒有到你手裹來搶，不過你能保牢這二枚銅元是很難的工作。</p>
<p>這二件是上海每天要發生數千百件的最普通的事，如果以為做人的藝術不過如此，那我是世界是上第一個大罪人了。我們要透視這二件事的真相，就是這二件事為什麼發生得這樣普遍，這樣迅速呢：這中間就有做人的藝術在。假若你做了煙兌店的老闆，（這是相當可能的）或做了乞丐，（這是一個極大的笑話，不過有人研究［死］的真相，而弄假成真自縊而死，嘗試做一次乞丐，未必你就是個不可救藥的人物，在自食其力的一點上說，你有著偉大的人格，所以或者不是個笑話。身當其衝就知道這一點藝術關於做人之道大矣哉！</p>
<p>我又說要一句不使人信任的話了，馬路上是最不平等的塲合。雖說無論貧富貴賤都可以在這馬路上走走，但是正因為貧富貴賤都在這馬路上，就發生了不平的事，不過知道明哲保身之說，你大可以逢兇化吉的取三十六著之最上策，只要自己不捲在漩渦之中。在馬路上切忌是激昂慷慨，這在做人的藝術之中呌處世哲學，似乎已是大家知道的事了，熱而殃及池魚的當不在少數。</p>
<p>如果要詳細地的記述起來，在短短的千字篇幅中無論如何容納不下的，而且未曾經我發見的甚多，且後有閑，當做一件像中國文學史類的工作，望同志們共襄盛舉。</p>
<p>最後聲明，做這類工作衣服不要十分破陋不堪，否則是絕大的障礙，我每天有幾小時的時間化在馬路上的，平均總背上一襲老虎皮的西裝，價格雖不甚高貴，式樣卻很入時，某日天雨，因未備雨衣，穿長袍而帶雨傘，猶被愛多亞路窗洞中的仁兄捉住了我的手，他單刀直入說我近來運氣不佳，命註破財，雖經過他幾次的［不　］我終於掉頭走了。這在他的失望很大，正因為他做人的藝術沒有爐火純青的緣故。</p>

<h3>希臘與羅馬之建築（上）</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>（甲）希臘建築</p>
<p>希臘建築為什麼這樣的發達，大半就因了牠的環境優美的緣故。希臘真可以說是得天獨厚的地方；在世界上很少有別的地方能比牠有更完美的山水風景。因此牠的人民都是受天然美景的陶冶，審美的觀念極其發達，自然他們的建築也就特別的充滿著美麗和雄壯。從其建築上我們可以看出希臘人很喜歡應用簡單的直綫美，他們更注重於力的表現。</p>
<p>希臘宗教和我們以前所說過的埃及宗教不同，牠不是一個含有恐怖性的東西，其所崇拜者惟有美麗，真實，和善三假想像。這三種假想觀念就溶化在精明的希臘人的生活中。</p>
<p>更有一點特殊的地方顯露在他們的文化上和建築上的，就是希臘人的民族精神很堅強。在那時奴隸雖尚未取消，但這不過是私人的一種顯繼罷了，奴隸可以不再受到專制國王的暴虐。他們的城市與城市之間，爭勝頗厲害，每一個城市內的居民，一定要稱他的城市的優點，並且還盡力以使期美觀。所以希臘建築，如廟宇，公共建築等，可以說不是賴著奴隸的苦力而建造成功的，這完全是一種愛的真實工作。</p>
<p>希臘人是極有理智性的人民。他們建造房屋的任何一部，必定先有相當的用處。所以他們建築中的列柱並非是用來裝飾美觀的，每一根柱上都有一部房屋的重量載著。他們不喜歡用弧形或任何曲線形的建築方法，以為這是缺少力量和直線的雄壯。因此他們就專用直柱與直線來建造許多偉大的奇觀，在建築史上便成一派。</p>
<p>但是希臘人並不是突然地發明出一種新的建築法，他們也是從逐漸地改良而得來的。當一所房屋建造成功之後，他們必再細心研究牠的各部份怎樣去改良使其美觀，然後全部的工程就日進於完美的地步，此乃希臘建築師成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>因為希臘宗教不是含有恐怖性的，所以牠的建築就毋須便禮拜者感到畏敬的意思，這不過是神人供奉的地方，空氣中滿充著天上和平的氣象。禮拜者都是留在廟宇以外的空地上朝拜，因此希臘人的廟宇並不怎樣廣大，他們可以注其全力以發揮建築之美觀。這一種從量的方面移轉到質的考究，便是藝術上一大進步的表示。</p>
<p>希臘建築式別的不同，可分三大類</p>
<p>一多列司式（doric　）</p>
<p>二伊華尼式（ronic）</p>
<p>三哥林多式（corinthian）</p>
<p>三式的不同地方全在柱頭（capitals）與屋盤（entablature）的分別。所謂柱頭，就是指柱的上端，其修飾可有各種不同之形式。所謂屋盤，就是在柱上統直的一部份，所謂屋盤，就是在柱上統直的一部份，包括了軒緣（architrave）與小壁（frieze）。在屋盤與屋頂之間，就是所謂三角頂（pediment）。多列司式。伊華尼式與哥林多式，都是從牠們的創造者的種族名而稱名的。我們有時呌牠們做三種［柱式］，因為其分別大半在柱上的緣故。</p>
<p>希臘人賴著藝術的天才，就從這三種柱式上翻造出無數偉大的建築來。其最尊貴的要算他們的廟宇，設計得十分簡單，但是都是極其巧妙的完美。這些廟宇並非是神妙不測的聖廟，所以牠們不像埃及廟宇的這樣黑暗龐大，其美麗卻要在光明的日光之下來顯示出各部的整齊和荘嚴。</p>
<p>但是希臘人對於他們住屋的建築很不注意，大都是十分狹小的房屋，原因就因為他們平日喜歡到市塲，戲院，廟宇等公共的地方去，不時常住在家裹的緣故。所以這些古時的城市中，充滿著一列一列的好像小的白方塊一般的房屋，一點也沒有什麼可注意的地方。可是那些公共建築卻都是很整齊，裝飾得非常美麗，直到現在雖然破壞不堪，也仍可以表示了從前人的可敬的工作。</p>

<p>嘗考我國史冊記載：亞東中世紀之一般建築，其精神及物質，與歐洲法蘭西中古時期之建築，確有殊途同歸，遙遙相對之概，蓋一則受宗教之縛束，一則由儒家之統治也。在法國中古時代，凡屬為希臘現世精神，因卽嬗蛻而演成哥德式之築風；在我國中古期，以受印度佛法之流傅，於是不期然而有笈多式築風之實現，換言之；十字軍之戰爭，六朝之紛亂，是皆藝術之革命，而為建築之成功。緣是，由中古以迄近古，應咸推宗教之建築物，最有價值，最稱偉大！漢晉之世，崇尚名節清談，遺風所被，南北朝繼起而研究佛老，土大夫受思潮之影響，壓世逃禪，比比皆是；甚至一代帝王，舍去名器，投身於寺院，職是之故，當里廟宇寶塔，關於宗教之建築物，遂以繁興，抑且荘嚴宏壯，穆肅堂皇，莫不絕端神秘，罕世無儔。</p>
<p>宗教文化，時代思想。固可於建築物中，而有顯然之表示，但建築工程為一事，建築之義意，為又一事，信未可同日而語。譬之：夏桀商紂之築宮苑池沼，專為個人娛樂；秦始皇之築長城，則為國防禦侮；雖同為開一代建築之風，然在桀紂，固不足法，卽秦始皇在當時，勞民傷財，不為世諒，而責其為大興土木之罪人。獨觀於歷史之宗教建築，反無悠悠之口，訾議其間，抑又何歟？可知我國歷代之宗教建築物，其義意涵育至廣，包羅亦大，而宗教與建築，又若十分密切，視為當然之象徵，是誠令人百思而不得其解。</p>
<p>石窟之建築，自亦有關係宗教者也。如北魏之雲崗，及龍門兩處。最稱偉大。而北響堂之刻經洞，釋迦洞，大佛洞，與夫南響堂之華巖，般若七洞等，尤足驚人！他如：隨代山東這龍洞，玉函山之佛龕，雲門山駝山之石窟；唐朝歷城神通寺之千佛崖，墩煌嗚沙山之石窟等等：迄今依然崢嶸而存，尚有遺跡之可尋也。</p>
<p>最近蔣軍委長因西行巡視，道經大同，震於雲崗建築之奇特偉大，曾經便道往游。按雲崗石窟建築之奇，非特國內鮮有其匹，恐全世界中亦無有可比。蓋各窟內所雕塑之佛像，皆就崖石而琢成，大小不一，共計在二十萬尊左右，最高大者，竟至六七十丈之間，約有六百馀，小者乃微至一二寸三四寸不等，每一石佛，神形各異，妙到毫顛，卽此一點，已屬鬼斧神工，似此曠代建築物，豈但足稱神秘藝術而已哉？故歐美之建築家，雕刻家，來華游此，無不咋舌，幾不信為人工所製。惟吾國人多不知此古代藝術之可寶，尤其一般貪利枉法之徒，往往持器偷確佛頭，希圖售賣牟利，致使萬佛壁上，無頭之石佛，觸目皆是。因小失大，毀及國寶，罪不容誅，故此次蔣氏知其事，特面囑晉省當局，嚴加禁止與保護，無使此偉大藝術再受摧殘也。</p>
<h3>新式住宅設計上應有的注意（續）</h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>會客室和廚房的距離，對於整個住宅的命運有很密切的關係，過去的住宅設計，每把會客室和廚房間相離很近，這種設計，差不多很普遍，而同時，最不能使人滿意，牠的最大的缺點，就是一切嘈雜的鬧聲（如整理蔬菜，煮菜等聲浪）和討厭的間霧，會不斷地擾亂會客室的清靜，飛舞的煤煙和灰質使你會客室內潔白的牆壁染汗，所以新式住宅的設計，應當使牠們間的距離愈遠愈妙，最好牠們中間隔著一個儲藏食料室，同時可收便利的效用。</p>
<p>廚房內部設計最困難的地方，就是［清潔］的保持，因為廚房內一切的東西，例如油類，燃料等，最容易使牆壁和天花板染上烏黑的油灰，使整個廚房陷入黑暗世界，這種不清潔和不合衛生的設計，應當盡力的免除牠，多量的通風，能免減少煙灰的生成，便於粉刷的牆壁和天花板，都可以釀造科學化的［廚房］。</p>
<p>二牆壁隔離的重要</p>
<p>僅用磚和泥砌的牆壁，已證明有極壞的現象，一方面使牆壁易於損壞，另一方面使室內溫度調節困難，而生不快的感覺，過去住宅建築的缺痕，就在此點。</p>
<p>新式建築的牆壁中間，都需要一層薄薄的隔離物，這種隔離物，用金屬或是木料製成，牠們能夠保持室內的溫度平均，同時使磚塊或是水泥層不發生熱漲冷縮的現象，因而延長牠們的生命，這是很經濟的，在外國，這種隔離物已發明的有幾十種的多，每一種隔離物都有牠的特殊應用，聲浪的隔離，近年來各國已有很速的進步，新式住宅設計時都應加以考慮和商確。</p>
<p>三窗戶方向的重要</p>
<p>窗戶的方向，影響整個住宅的安適，設計時應那以特別的考慮，充滿太陽光照射的房屋，每使牠們有［生氣］和合於衛生，面北的窗戶，應當盡力的免除，萬不能免時，最好同時開放其他方向的窗戶，務使適當的日光射入，以清潔室內的空氣，（殺除微菌），玻璃窗的面積，最好佔地板面積十分之一，最易得到良好的結果。</p>
<p>過去住宅設計中對於窗戶的方向問題，都漠然置之，這是很不好的現象，我們應該盡力的改良牠。</p>
<p>四建築材料的選擇</p>
<p>建築材料的選擇，關係整個住宅建築的經濟和堅固問題很大，在設計的時候，我們應當選擇同樣堅固而最經濟的材料，這樣一來，不但使建築費用減輕，同時使你的設計容易成功，這種機巧的設計，是二十世紀中所最需要的，笨重的實料磚塊憶被輕巧的空心磚塊所淘汰，空心磚的質量和價格都比前者輕，但是有同樣的支持力，所以權衡起來，建築費用減輕多多，巨大的十九世紀石質建築，現在已被質輕而更堅強的鋼骨水泥所替代，凡此種種，都顯示著材料選擇的重要。</p>
<p>新式住宅中，絕對避免用顯露的柱子，因為牠們足以減少住宅的體積，同時足以妨害觀瞻，用工或工形樑以替代柱子，最屬經濟，此建築家所應注意的。</p>
<p>總之，過去住宅建築之所以不能使人滿意，由於設計的墨守舊規，而疏忽最重要的部分，新式的住宅設計中，我們應該努力地去改進牠。（完）</p>

<h3>Extended Memorial Week in Jiangxi</h3>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Three-Point Report</h3>

Now that the bandit suppression work is about to be completed, we should redouble our efforts and continue to strengthen ourselves. Otherwise, everyone's past hard work and achievements will be wiped out. Next, he said that during the past bandit suppression period, he proposed the slogan of "three parts military and seven parts politics," but in reality, perhaps seven parts of military force and three parts of political force were used. In the future, the Party and government must work together to at least achieve seven parts of effort to eliminate the remaining bandits, engage in reorganization and construction. Finally, he said that this time he inspected the provinces in North China, and he felt that there has been progress in the politics of each province. Although some provinces lack talent and economy, the achievements are particularly good, which is even more commendable. Jiangxi should intensify its work.</p>

It has been verified that this place has been occupied by bandits for a long time and is called the 'pseudo-capital.' Now that it has been recovered, the bandits have lost their base. Having heard the news, our joy knows no bounds. Thinking of the past few years, our Chairman has been working tirelessly and worrying, not even sleeping. Now that the bandits have been swept away and the country's prestige has been greatly enhanced, it shows that the decision-making and planning are well-calculated and certain to win. The bandit gangs are like the great achievements of Yang Ming in pacifying the rebels, and the strongholds of Huai and Cai are like Pei Du's achievements in capturing Wu Yuanji. The command is well-established, relying entirely on your wise intentions. As for the soldiers on all routes, they have killed the enemy and achieved results, both loyal and brave, and are truly hardworking and meritorious, adding glory to the history of war. We still hope to take advantage of this great victory and move forward with the wind, destroying those fierce and stubborn elements, so that no remnants are left. Then, the Zhang River and Gong River will help to celebrate, and the Gengling Mountains and Lushan Mountains will all open with smiles. The glorious world is all rebuilt by our Chairman and the soldiers on all routes. Sincerely praying, we humbly ask for your consideration. The Special Party Department of the 41st Division of the Army respectfully kowtows. [Stamp]</p>

<h3>Telegrams to the Three Northeastern Provinces Should Be Routed Through Us</h3>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Cables International Telecommunications Union</h3>
<h3>Requesting Notification to Contracting Countries to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Nanjing Special Dispatch, 19th: The Ministry of Communications reported that since May 21 of this year, the Shanghai Pacific Underwater Cable Company has been sending telegrams to various places in the Three Northeastern Provinces via the Shanghai-Nagasaki underwater cable of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, rather than sending them to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau for forwarding. Nor do they pay us the line fees. The Ministry believes that telegrams from all countries to China should be forwarded through the Chinese Telegraph Bureau as the proper route. The Three Northeastern Provinces are our country's territory. Not only does our country not recognize the existing pseudo-organizations, but all countries in the world also regard them as illegal. All telegrams to that place, although transmitted by the Japanese Ministry of Communications and the International Telecommunications Union, may be delivered by Japan, but our country has solemnly declared that it does not recognize the company's change of telegrams to the Three Northeastern Provinces to be forwarded by Japan, which infringes upon our country's telecommunications sovereignty and damages our country's interests. A serious protest has been lodged with the company. Recently, the company replied that it will forward telegrams to the Three Northeastern Provinces through the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau in the future. As for the telegrams that were changed to be forwarded by Japan after May 21, the company is willing to pay China's line fees. Therefore, this case has now been resolved through negotiations. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, the Ministry yesterday telegraphed the International Telecommunications Union again, notifying all signatory countries to pay close attention. Except for Russia and Japan, which border the provinces, all telegrams to the Three Northeastern Provinces of China should be sent to Shanghai for transshipment through China's domestic lines.</p>
<h3>Malanyu Can Be Received at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch, 19th: Regarding the Japanese side's receipt of Malanyu, they indicated that the documents could not be processed in time and that they would be returned on December 1. The Japanese and puppet military camps in Xinglong are being repaired. Recently, 100 Japanese troops and two companies of puppet cavalry were stationed in Malanyu, most of them near the Eastern Tombs. According to reliable information, this matter is related to the incident in Huairou. If the Huairou case is resolved, the receipt of Malanyu will not be a problem.</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch, 19th: The Japanese army currently stationed in Malanyu has 100 infantrymen, led by Captain Miyamama. On the 17th, he went to Chengde on official business. The puppet army stationed in Malanyu city has two companies of cavalry. There are about 700 Japanese and puppet troops in the Eastern Tombs area.</p>
<h3>Tangshan Public Security Bureau Busts Traitor Organization</h3>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch, 19th: Recently, traitors Qi Duanqing, Song Mingyong, Shi Zihua, Wang Wanfa, and Li Runtian secretly organized the "Donghui Company" in the Tongle Tea Garden in Xiaoshan, Tangshan. It served as the East Office of the pseudo-country stationed in Tangshan, and also trafficked in drugs. On the surface, they colluded with pimp Liu Jiangshi, and prostitutes Liu Yufen and Jiang Yixia, pretending to open brothels to avoid attention. On the 18th, the Tangshan Public Security Bureau investigated the case and dispatched Inspector Wang Yunhan, the Public Security Team Captain Luo Weifen, the Inspection Office Director, and detectives to ambush the place at night. A thousand people were arrested, and many relevant documents were seized.</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch, 19th: On the night of the 18th, Wang Yunhan, Inspector of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, led the Public Security Team Captain and police officers to the Tongle Tea Garden in Xiaoshan and arrested the traitors Qi Duanqing, Song Mingyong, Kang Zihua, Wang Wanfa, Li Runtian, the pimp Liu Jiangshi, and the prostitutes Liu Yufen and Jiang Xia, who were using the opening of a brothel as a cover. Many important documents were seized. The bandits were ordered by the pseudo-state to set up an East-West company in Tangshan to spread the pseudo-political orders to the counties in the war zone.</p>
<p>Tianjin Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th: The Tangshan Public Security Bureau received reports that a Communist Party organ had been set up, ostensibly as a brothel, but with some other purpose. On the evening of the 17th, it sent detectives to surround and arrest the criminals Song Minyong, Lian Zihua, Wang Wanfa, Li Runshi, and eight prostitutes. Many pieces of evidence were seized. Because the case was serious, they will be sent to the provincial government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Visits Huang Fu</h3>
<h3>Reports on the Latest Situation in Chahar East</h3>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch, 19th: This morning, Song Zheyuan summoned Qin Decun and Xiao Zhenying to his private residence to talk.

<h3>No New Developments in the Shi Case</h3>
<h3>Lu Diping Submits Reply to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<h3>Reports on the Handling Progress</h3>
<h3>Plans to Reissue Orders Limiting Time to Capture Criminals</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Special Dispatch, 19th: Zhejiang and Shandong Chairman Lu Diping sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, which read: "I have received your telegram with respect. Zhejiang Province's transportation and public security have been developed into a plan last year, and I have urged my subordinates to implement it. Unfortunately, this case occurred on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. There was indeed insufficient prevention, and I feel deeply guilty. After the case occurred, a reward of 10,000 yuan was offered, and I strictly ordered the entire province and repeatedly telegraphed the political, military, and police agencies in Nanjing, Jiangsu, and Shanghai to arrest the criminals. I also instructed the Hangzhou Garrison Command, the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and the county magistrates of Hangzhou and Haining to capture the criminals within ten days and send them for trial, and ordered the departments to jointly draft a plan for national highway transportation security protection. I have also ordered the responsible officials to be investigated and dealt with. In accordance with the previous instructions in the telegram, in addition to ordering my subordinates to intensify the investigation, I have combined the handling of the case and submitted it for inspection.

<h3>The Difficulty of Convening a Second Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>The preliminary talks of the Anglo-American-Japanese naval preparatory conference have been underway since June 19th. After much negotiation, little progress has been made. The biggest sticking point is the firm stance of Japan and the ambiguous attitude of Britain. Japan's disarmament policy has long been formulated. Its content is nothing more than demanding that all countries abolish the ratio system and replace it with the total tonnage system, and ensure the principles of national defense autonomy and equal armaments. In essence, it almost wants to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty in order to exert its ambition to dominate the China Sea and the western Pacific. According to the provisions of the treaty, if any of the signatory countries announces its cancellation before the end of 1934, it will become invalid upon expiration. Now that Japan is determined to abolish the treaty, it will inevitably affect the position of other contracting countries. The United States, which has always maintained the current treaty as its duty, is the first to bear the brunt and cannot but actively resist. It is estimated that there are two strategies for its resistance. One is to strengthen the US-owned naval and air force bases in the Pacific, making Japan feel a great threat. The second is to mix political issues with naval technology and strategic issues, so that countries with political demands in the Pacific can obtain access to the 1935 naval conference. This point conflicts with Japan's existing interests and is also recognized by informed people. Recently, the US government decided to allocate huge sums of money to renovate military ports such as Hawaii, and senior officials in Washington are studying the convening of a second Pacific conference and discussing political issues, which are probably manifestations of the implementation of the above two strategies.</p>
<p>Since the first Pacific Conference was convened, the situation in the Pacific has changed repeatedly. The most prominent of these are the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, the expansion of Soviet Russian power, the determination of Philippine independence, the advancement of naval and air force technology, and the announcement of Japan's [417] threatening statement. All of these will have a great impact on the future situation in the Pacific, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Former US Secretary of State Stimson believed that the Washington Naval Treaty, the Four-Power Treaty, and the Nine-Power Treaty are closely related and cannot be separated. Moreover, the complexity of today's international situation often allows a single hair to move the whole body. Therefore, the reason why naval issues cannot be separated from political issues is due to the force of circumstances and cannot be denied. Judging from Mr. Stimson's theory, after Japan notified the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Four-Power and Nine-Power Treaties will also change accordingly. According to reason, they should be re-evaluated. However, Japan believes that all of these are political issues and should not be discussed in parallel with naval issues. Moreover, [the Manchurian Incident and the previous disputes in Geneva have proved the ineffectiveness of conference diplomacy. The overall situation in the Far East has now clearly defined the scope, and there is nothing to discuss,] and so on. Looking at its forceful and unreasonable tone, it has no sincerity to compromise. In this atmosphere of US-Japan opposition, the British are in a pivotal position. Unfortunately, the British attitude is ambiguous and wavering between pro-Japanese and pro-American paths, hesitating and unable to make a decision. The impact is just enough to increase the arrogance of the Japanese. On July 18 this year, British Foreign Secretary Simon's reply to a member of parliament stated that the 1935 naval conference would not expand its scope beyond naval issues to discuss political issues in the Pacific and the Far East. It is said that the British government had a tacit understanding with the Japanese in advance, so it could say it so definitively. If this statement is credible, then even if the Washington side publicizes the convening of a second Pacific conference, it is actually far from possible.</p>
<p>We still remember that the first Pacific Conference, although convened in the name of US President Harding, was motivated by British encouragement. The British autonomous colonies, dissatisfied with the existence of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, urged it vigorously and enthusiastically. Looking at the attitude of the British, it is enough to make people feel deeply pessimistic. Moreover, when the first conference was convened, the European war had just ended, and people were tired of war. The voice of peace swept the world, so those who attended the conference held considerable sincerity. As for the Far East, the most important outstanding issue between China and Japan was the Shandong issue. The Japanese clearly knew that Britain, France, Italy, and the United States had all advocated at the Paris Peace Conference that German interests in Shandong be transferred to Japan. If this issue was raised at the conference, victory would be in their hands, so they dared to be confident. However, they still believed that attending this conference was no different from appearing in an international court to await public judgment. They hesitated again and again and reluctantly embarked on the journey. As for the Tokyo government today, it has long been manipulated by the military, which is different from the first conference. Moreover, the stain of the Manchurian case has been criticized by the world, and the situation is very different from the Shandong issue at that time. There is no doubt that it will not readily participate in the second Pacific conference to engage in the discussion of political issues. If Japan does not participate, then the [conference] will not be held, and what [discussion] will there be? It can be seen that the Washington side's propaganda is at best a strategy to threaten Japan. It is absolutely impossible to see it in reality.</p>
<h3>Naval Negotiations Enter an Important Stage</h3>
<p>Japanese Reply Delivered to British Representative</p>
<p>British and Japanese Hold Fifth Consultation</p>
<p>Three-Country Talks Fail, Britain and the United States Seek Compromise First</p>
<p>London The fifth British-Japanese talks will begin at 3:30 pm on the 19th. (19th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>London The naval negotiations have now entered the final decision stage. A senior British diplomatic official declared to the British press this morning that the general public is now planning to theoretically recognize the principle of Japan's naval equality, but the British government wants to find a way to reach an agreement so that the British and American navies can maintain a considerable advantage in practice. According to this morning's news, Japan seems to have recognized the vast needs of the British Imperial Navy for defense, but it does not allow the United States to have the same naval needs as Britain. (19th Havas)</p>
<p>London The Japanese reply to the British compromise plan will be delivered to British Foreign Secretary Simon by Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira tonight. It is heard that Britain pointed out in its proposal that although Japan stated that it wanted to reach a common height, it has not built warships to this extent. Therefore, Britain asked Japan whether its demand for naval equality for the sake of face could be satisfied on the one hand by the recognition of Japan's equal status and on the other hand by the continued regulation of naval power. At the same time, Britain also put forward another opinion to Japan that the comparative strength of the navies of various countries may be maintained to some extent by each country announcing its warship construction program for the next five or ten years in advance to replace the Washington ratio. It is expected that when Matsudaira meets Simon tonight, he will arrange a meeting of all the British and Japanese representatives. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>At the same time, Britain is working hard to reach a compromise. If it cannot be realized, Britain and the United States will seek a compromise first, so that Japan can join later. The British side feels that there are some valuable clauses in the Washington Convention that should be preserved, such as the notification to other countries when a country in the convention adds warships, and the clause not to set up armaments (Article 19), but this section has not yet been closely discussed. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>London After Japan rejected the naval compromise plan proposed by Britain, the British and American representatives discussed ways to break the deadlock in the naval discussions at the end of the week. The American representative is now eagerly awaiting Washington's reply to Britain's suggestion to conclude a new treaty, in which each country makes concessions. The American side is still optimistic about the new approach, which is to allow Japan to deploy more submarines, allow the United States to deploy more battleships and aircraft carriers, and allow Britain to deploy more cruisers. In principle, it recognizes Japan's equality, but still retains the 5:5:3 ratio. It is heard that Japan is still insisting on its original position on the ratio issue, and on the other hand, it is studying a compromise method so that it can save money on building warships and avoid losing face at home. British Foreign Secretary Simon will announce the latest situation of the naval talks today, but before speaking, Britain will inform the American representative of the situation of the talks between British Foreign Office Clerk Craig and Japanese Embassy Counselor Kato at the end of the week. The American representative still knows nothing about the nature of the document Kato recently sent to Craig. (19th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Diplomatic Efforts to Reconcile US-Japan Differences</h3>
<p>Seeking a Technical Compromise</p>
<p>To Avoid Talks Breaking Down</p>
<p>London Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira are scheduled to meet at 5:45 pm today. This meeting will be a diplomatic-style talk. The purpose of the talk is mostly to avoid the impact that Japan's rejection of the compromise may have on the naval negotiations, and not to discuss a compromise to reconcile the existing differences. In today's British-Japanese talks, Ambassador Matsudaira will explain in detail the Japanese government's reply to the British proposal. The general public recognizes that if Japan's refusal to accept the British proposal is carried out in a reckless manner, the naval negotiations will completely fail. Therefore, the task of both parties today is to find a way to avoid the atmosphere being too tense during the next talk, or to use a contrived way to alleviate the conflict between Japan and the United States as much as possible. The general public believes that Ambassador Matsudaira is more inclined to compromise than Japanese Navy Lieutenant General Yamamoto. According to people around Ambassador Matsudaira this morning, if the United States accepts the principle of Japan's proposal, Japan can make considerable concessions on the details in exchange. However, this declaration is undoubtedly only the opinion of a part of the Japanese delegation. Since the opinions within the Japanese delegation are inconsistent, the British side plans to take the opportunity to use it to seek a way to transfer the delegation. However, if it is believed that there are fundamental differences in opinions within the Japanese delegation, it is inevitable to exaggerate. The diplomatic personnel in the Japanese delegation believe that if the failure of the negotiations cannot be avoided, they should at least avoid the responsibility for the failure of the negotiations. Whether this kind of British diplomatic activity can achieve results is also a question. As for the American side, it is quite pessimistic about the possibility of Japan softening. A certain American representative said, [This matter is of great importance and difficult to deal with]. In short, the naval talks will be carried out by the British side with double efforts within this week. First, it seeks to avoid the negotiations from becoming tense immediately, and then seeks a technical compromise, and this effort may be made by Prime Minister MacDonald. The Prime Minister is more eager than anyone to avoid the breakdown of negotiations due to British domestic and foreign relations. (19th Havas)</p>
<h3>French Famous Reporter Observes That Talks Are Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>Paris Famous reporter Betina published an article in the Paris Echo, commenting on the naval talks, saying that [Japan will definitely refuse to accept the compromise proposal put forward by the United Kingdom]. He said, [If the British want to save the results of the Washington and London naval conferences in 1923 and 1930, and not let them disappear, they must express concessions in the following ways, that is, no longer require the limitation of the number of various warships that countries can build, but limit the tonnage and armament of various types of ships. However, this method will reduce the procedure of the 1935 naval conference. Regardless of the extreme opposition of the United States, Japan may not be happy to accept it. The reason why the United States opposes it is that once this method is adopted, it will no longer be able to use its financial and industrial advantages to build great warships that exceed other countries. As for Japan, its naval authorities are planning to restore freedom in order to engage in the improvement of naval technology, and qualitative restrictions are also not welcome by the country]. (19th Havas)</p>
<h3>Japan Smiles at the Convening of the Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo According to Washington news, American officials are considering convening a general conference of Pacific countries for the purpose of discussing political issues, and the Japanese diplomatic authorities laugh at this. The opinions held are as follows: Since the American side agreed that the London preparatory consultations will not discuss political issues, even if this kind of conference is advocated, the United Kingdom will not agree. Even if there are no controversial issues between Japan and the United States at present, the exchange of notes between Hirota and Hull is the diplomatic basis, so there is no problem with holding multilateral international conferences. (19th Dentsu)</p>
<h3>US-Japan Opinions Differ, Britain Seeks a Win-Win Strategy</h3>
<p>Naval Restrictions Focus on Quality Rather Than Quantity</p>
<p>London The Times reported on Sunday that some parties are increasingly criticizing the principle of limiting the amount of naval forces, saying that if it is most restricted, [those who advocate large navies will be greedy and insatiable, and what they consider the highest quantity today will be considered the lowest quantity tomorrow. The general public believes that it is not a long-term strategy for the United States and Japan to hold on to their views for a long time. It is said that the naval talks will quickly move in a new direction, because limiting the amount of naval forces only makes countries increase a large amount of naval expenditures, and the comparative strength of those navies may not be strengthened as a result. Therefore, it is advocated to focus on qualitative restrictions. The British government has been moved by this statement. Judging from the active participation of Finance Minister Chamberlain in this naval talk, it is clear that the London government is unwilling to increase the financial burden. We therefore believe that the naval talks will focus on the limitation of the size and armament strength of various warships in order to expand the qualitative provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty. This method may be adopted by the British side until the final period, but although this method indirectly conforms to the requirements put forward by Japan, its resistance from the United States is undoubtedly inevitable, because the American representative Davis and his colleagues insist on their original views and strictly adhere to a principle, that is, to maintain the Washington Naval Treaty, without increasing or decreasing it].

<h3>Japanese Navy Requests Additional Budget</h3>
<p>Tokyo The Navy Headquarters is determined to restore the 89 million yuan in the naval budget. The reasons advocated by the Navy are as follows: 1. The main battleship should be completed in Showa 11 (1936) in accordance with the established policy, which is absolutely necessary for national defense. The refurbishment cost of the main battleship cannot be compromised for any reason. 2. The maintenance cost of the new warships and the maintenance cost of the air force are necessary expenses for the implementation of the second supplementary plan. The Navy absolutely requires this expense to be recognized. 3. The land and water maintenance costs and the military supplies maintenance costs are also absolutely necessary expenses for the implementation of the national defense plan, and of course, they require its realization. 4. The Japanese government's attitude of not sparing the national defense budget can make Japan's claims easier to implement in the naval preparatory meeting and the next disarmament conference.

<h3>International Wool Federation Resolves to Boycott Japanese Dumping</h3>
<p>Reuters Paris, October 30 The Board of Directors of the International Wool Federation is here. The main event of its discussion is to boycott the dumping of Japanese wool goods. One article has been passed, and the resolution is as follows: [The Board of Directors of the International Wool Federation recognizes the astonishingly rapid expansion of Japanese exports, especially in markets outside Europe, and its selling price damages the industries of member states and the living standards of European production centers. Therefore, it advocates that the national committees organized by members of the International Wool Federation urge their respective governments to consider the need to implement import quotas or other self-defense methods to boycott Japanese wool products.]</p>
<h3>International Management of Arms Trade Issues</h3>
<p>Wilmington, USA Dupont, the general manager of Hengxin Company, wrote to Senator Nye, chairman of the Senate Fire Investigation Committee, today, advocating that the arms trade should be controlled by the government and supervised internationally. Dupont agrees to manage it very strictly in accordance with the regulations of the National Land Convention and proposes that American arms should not be allowed to leave the country without a government license. However, he opposes the government's monopoly on arms in any form because it would weaken or destroy national defense. When the Senate investigated the arms trade, the business of Hengxin Company attracted much attention, because the company's stock during the European War, the so-called Dupont pigment stock, received extremely good interest. It is estimated that the company's surplus reached 458% of its original capital. (19th Reuters)</p>

<p>The report of the League of Nations Committee investigating the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay reflects the experience gained by the League of Nations in handling the Sino-Japanese dispute. This report is similar to the Lytton Manchuria Report in general, but its suggestions seem to be more progressive than the suggestions of the Lytton Investigation Team. All the work of the committees dealing with the Bolivian dispute has a pre-determined deadline, which is a new feature. Approximately the two South American belligerent countries can accept this report, and this report can be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Content of the Recommendation</h3>
<p>The recommendation states that neither of the warring parties has fulfilled the obligations under Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant (this article stipulates that members agree to submit disputes that could lead to a rupture to arbitration or review by the Council and refrain from resorting to war rashly). However, if they accept the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, they can compensate for the crime of breach of contract. Both parties must accept all recommendations. The report advocates for the establishment of a neutral supervisory committee with six members to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire and the establishment of a neutral zone. After this neutral zone is established, neither party shall build fortresses or transport military supplies. Within one month of the establishment of this plan, negotiations for a peace treaty must begin in the capital of Argentina and will last for a maximum of two months. The report supports the actions of some members of the League of Nations to prohibit the supply of arms to the warring states, but it advocates that if one party accepts the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly while the other party does not, the nation that has accepted the recommendations of the General Assembly can be exempt from the prohibition of supplying arms.

<p>The twenty-two-member committee in Geneva mediating the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America unanimously adopted a report yesterday, which was released, stating that the measures set forth in the report must be accepted in their entirety and cannot be selectively chosen, and there are no other conditions except that the opposing country also accepts. This report, under the supervision of a neutral committee, will be formally notified to the two countries involved. Hostilities must cease within six days of notification. The neutral committee will be composed of Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and other countries. Brazil and the United States will also be invited to participate. A demilitarized zone 100 li wide shall also be demarcated within ten days under the supervision of the neutral committee. The mediation committee advocates that the neutral committee (which is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the cessation of hostilities) should meet in the capital of Argentina, and decisions will be made by a majority vote and will have all the material means necessary to monitor the ceasefire. The demilitarized zone is absolutely unrelated to the borders between the two governments. At most, within one month after the cessation of hostilities, a meeting must be held to discuss border issues. In addition to Bolivia and Paraguay, neighboring countries as well as Ecuador and Venezuela should also participate. If the discussion yields no results after one month, or if arbitration fails, the case will be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for judgment. The report passed by the mediation committee advocates the prohibition of the transport of arms and ammunition to warring countries as a means of maintaining the ceasefire. For the measures recommended by the mediation committee, an advisory committee will be organized to monitor their implementation. All twenty-two countries of the mediation committee are included, and the United States and Brazil will also be invited to participate. The advisory committee should meet no later than December 12 of this year. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Latvia Celebrates Independence Day</h3>

<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on Latvia and the Nordic Alliance</h3>
<p>The Moscow Pravda published an article on the military cooperation of the Scandinavian countries, stating that [for several months] the Scandinavian press has commented on the issue of military cooperation among the four countries of the peninsula, especially the military press. Since the meeting of the ambassadors of the four countries in September of this year to discuss the matter, propaganda for a military alliance has been particularly intensified. To this day, the idea of a military bloc of Scandinavian countries has been proposed. Norwegian Navy Captain Kvamm wrote an article that was widely published in peninsula newspapers. Kvamm strongly asserted that a war against the Soviet Union is inevitable, and its ultimate victory or defeat will be determined on the Baltic Sea coast. Pravda commented on this and pointed out that the author excluded Denmark from the Scandinavian military alliance because of territorial disputes between Denmark and Germany. [This alone is enough to show the pro-German nature of the Scandinavian military alliance. The clamor of the peninsula press is clearly inspired by a large amount of external influence. Finland has a significant influence on the strengthening of the military tendencies of the Scandinavian countries, and the close connection between the Finnish fascist warlords and the German fascist warlords is well known.] Pravda concluded that [the purpose of the blocs and alliances in this plan is not difficult for us to discern. The fact that German fascism supports these plans is a fact. Its intention is to turn the Baltic Sea into a Germanic lake and the Scandinavian countries into its own bases.] (TASS, 18th)</p>

<h3>China's Silver Export Tax Makes People Pay Attention to India</h3>
<p>A report from the National City Bank of New York today stated that China's silver export tax has shifted the world's attention to India. India is an important source of silver supply, and its treasury reserves are currently around 338 million ounces, a decrease of 118 million ounces compared to 1931. However, there is still a lot of silver in private hands, which they are temporarily unwilling to sell, hoping to get a good price. If both China and India stop supplying, the price of silver will reach a high of $1.29 per ounce. However, if other countries do not buy silver from each other, this high price may not be sustainable. If the United States continues to raise its price, China will inevitably levy a higher export silver tax to protect its monetary system. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>The Fujian Provincial Government Bans the Planting of Opium</h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government issued an order today banning the planting of poppies within the province, with violators subject to the death penalty. The authorities have printed 800,000 leaflets of this ban and distributed them by airplane in the western and southern parts of the province.

<p>A Record of Observations in the Northwest</p>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya.</p>
<p>Crescent Moon Spring and Thousand Buddha Caves in Dunhuang</p>
<p>Dunhuang has many historical sites, the most famous of which are two: Crescent Moon Spring, which is natural, and Thousand Buddha Caves, which are man-made. Both fully display their scenic characteristics and are worthy of description. Crescent Moon Spring, also known as Ancient Cliff Depression Pool, is where Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty obtained the Heavenly Horse from the water of the Cliff Depression Pool in the autumn of the fourth year of Yuanding. Emperor Wu wrote the Song of the Heavenly Horse. It is here. There was first a mountain from Anxi, with many blue-black stones, extending into the Dunhuang territory and transforming into the White Sand Ridge. Although the quality and color are completely different, the mountain range is still consistent. The sand ridge runs to the south of the city, about ten miles away, where the branches are staggered, forming a secluded valley. Following the mouth of the valley, there is a spring, which appears clear and blue at a glance, deep and quiet, about one mile in circumference. It is shaped like a crescent moon according to the mountain, hence the name Crescent Moon Spring.</p>
<p>The spring water is sweet and produces iron-backed fish and seven-star grass, which can be taken to prolong life. The spring is said to be forty feet deep. I once swam in it and felt that its buoyancy was weaker. The center is verdant and secluded, and I cannot see the bottom. I suddenly suspected that my body was relying on nothing and was shocked. I hastily circled the edge, which was rugged and sparse, with a unique charm. Behind the Crescent Moon Spring is a shallow grass lawn. Thirty or forty feet away, the sand mountain stands tall and upright, more than thirty feet high, steeper than the mountain stones. The back of the ridge is like a knife edge. People climb it, and it collapses with their feet. After a night of wind, it will revert to its original state. Sitting and sliding down makes a rumbling sound. Sometimes, even on a sunny day, it will naturally emit a faint sound of thunder, hence the name "Singing Sand." Picking up the sand and examining it, it is clearly divided into five colors. The sand has never filled the spring for thousands of years, and the spring has never dried up. These are all mysteries of the spring, which often leave ordinary people unable to figure them out. Inside the Crescent Moon Spring, the terrain is slightly higher. Elm, poplar, and jujube trees form a lush forest. The Wushan Temple, the Three Saints Palace, the Medicine King Temple, and other temples are built in the middle, with high pavilions towering into the sky and winding corridors leading to scenic spots, but they do not occupy much space because there are high ridges behind them. Looking down at the surrounding sand ridges, they are mutually related and fit together, presenting another crescent moon shape, hence the name Crescent Moon Mountain.</p>
<p>There is a terrace called "First Spring," which is located in the center of the Crescent Moon Spring and is sufficient for tourists to rest. Looking from the terrace to the north, first there are the reeds on the edge of the Crescent Moon Spring, then the clear, shimmering waves in the middle of the Crescent Moon Spring, which are both moving and still. The surrounding scenery is reflected in a thousand changes. Further away is the grass lawn and the upright Singing Sand Mountain. Looking left and right are the two corners of the crescent moon, which deeply surround the back. If you do not move dozens of feet, it is difficult to see its end. Tourists who come here often express their feelings with great poetry and write what they feel on the walls of the terrace. There are inscriptions such as "The Color of the Moon Spring is Unique" and "Another World," and couplets such as "The spring connects to the sea of stars, the ridge connects to the Flaming Mountain," poems such as "Many peaks stand in the south of Dunhuang City, a path opens up the beauty of forests and valleys, accumulated sand forms ridges that rise abruptly, and the wind blows for thousands of years without raising the sand," and songs such as "...The sound of sand roars and the four great elements are empty, all the mountains resonate with a strong wind, searching for the sound but not knowing where it is, the human world is vaguely like the Guanghan Palace..." The Thousand Buddha Caves, also known as Leiyin Temple, are located forty miles southeast of the city. It is not known when they were built, but there is a broken stele that says they were rebuilt in the Tang Dynasty. Numerous caves are carved out of the rock, with Buddhas and dragons layered upon each other, and the temple is magnificent, much like the works of Yungang in Datong. However, it also has its differences. The Yungang caves are condensed from fine sand, while these are made of coarse sand as large as broad beans. The former is yellow, while the latter is green. Secondly, most of the Buddha statues here are female, especially the numerous attendants, whose bodies are delicate and charming, with bare upper bodies, slender waists, and long legs, possessing the posture of Western sculptures of beauties. Thirdly, there are black statues, presumably of people of African descent who practiced Buddhism. Fourthly, although there are as many as a thousand Buddha caves, most of the Buddha statues are similar. Fifthly, the Buddha statues in Yungang, whether large or small, are all carved from the original rock, while the large Buddha statues here are mud sculptures and the small Buddha statues are colored paintings, which is quite different from Yungang. However, they are extremely exquisite, and from the above two or three points, it can be proved that the Buddha statues here clearly have a blend of Chinese and Western colors. All of this is not found in the Yungang Buddha Caves.</p>
<p>The Thousand Buddha Caves are carved out of the profile of a cliff, divided into four or five layers. It is said that there used to be pavilions connecting the layers, but they have all been destroyed. Only the first and second layers can be visited. I once saw two large caves with Buddha statues ten feet high, and they were seated statues. In one cave in the middle, a nine-story hall is currently being rebuilt. (Photograph inserted) It is said that 50,000 yuan has been used. There is also a large Buddha lying horizontally on the right side, also seven or eight feet long. Behind it are seventy-two nuns and monks standing in a row, looking like living people. However, the nuns are tall and strong, quite like Western women, and there are two or three dressed in foreign attire. The remaining small and medium-sized caves can be two or three cubic feet in size. The seated Buddha in the center of the cave often bends his stone arm and raises his palm in front of his chest, while his left hand rests on his crossed left knee, with a solemn and respectful air. He is accompanied by three or four attendants, standing, sitting, leaning, and reclining, with lively postures, holding flowers and bottles, and expressing different emotions. (Photograph inserted)</p>
<p>The decorations of the female attendant statues are similar, with a collar around their shoulders, made of gold, tightly holding several golden flowers, hanging down on both shoulders and in front and back of the chest. Each wrist and arm is full of two pairs of gold bracelets inlaid with precious stones. A colorful ribbon is used to drape diagonally from the right shoulder and tie a knot on the left rib. Some of the breasts and navel are covered by the ribbon, while others are completely exposed. A skirt hangs down from the waist, reaching to the back of the feet. The bare feet and jade toes seem to move.</p>
<p>Three thousand years ago, Buddhism gradually spread eastward, and Dunhuang was at the forefront. For a time, culture and relics were brilliant, and it was an important page in the history of Sino-Western cultural communication. During the late Qing Dynasty, foreigners such as Stein and Pelliot discovered ancient Western Xia illustrated books, handwritten Chinese-Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, and the Diamond Sutra printed and distributed by Wang Jie of China in the ninth year of Xiantong of the Tang Dynasty in the stone kilns that had collapsed due to rain in the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves. All of them were selectively stolen, truly treasures of a declining world. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, hundreds of White Russians came here to seek refuge with the introduction of Yang Zengxin (then the military governor of Xinjiang Province). In the cave on the highest floor, I saw a woman sitting cross-legged, decorated with real gold and jade, as luxurious as a Buddha statue. The White Russians stole all her treasures one by one, and the female corpse collapsed and scattered, looking like ashes. I once read a "Mogao Caves Stele," which recorded the Qinghai Queen Princess donating gold to repair the temple. I think this luxurious female corpse may be a Buddhist practitioner of the ancient aristocracy. The exquisite murals in each cave have not changed color for a long time, and many have been stolen by foreigners. Fortunately, one of the caves with a special picture of the national pictographic map is still intact. At that time, a certain foreigner bribed the White Russians with 100,000 gold to ask them to find a way to steal it. The matter was known to the people of Dunhuang, who tried their best to protect it, so it was unscathed. Such ancient objects in the Buddha Caves, the construction of which was magnificent and the effect far-reaching, were indeed a waste of money and resources when they were created, but after they were successfully created by the ancients, in a certain sense, later generations have the value of keeping them.</p>
<p>Southeast of the Thousand Buddha Caves, across the bank for several miles, three peaks stand tall and precarious, which are the mountains of "Shun's exile of the four fierce tribes to the Three Dangers." In the past, the Three Danger Mountains were recorded as having accumulated snow on the high peaks that did not melt in all seasons. In modern times, it is thought that due to climate change, snow is only seen in winter. Also, 140 miles west of the city is the site of the Han Dynasty Longle County, later changed to Shouchang County. Six miles further west is Yangguan, the ancient poem's "Westward out of Yangguan, there are no acquaintances." Now they are all buried in the desert. Han bricks have been excavated in Shouchang and identified, but it is still unknown where Yangguan is. County Magistrate Yang plans to go to excavate in the cool autumn. If it comes true, it is expected that valuable ancient objects will be discovered.</p>
<p>When the reporter returned from Dunhuang to Anxi, it happened that a Uyghur merchant from Hami, named "Assa," was about to drive a camel caravan back to Xinjiang to do business. With the introduction of Yuan Cenjun, I decided to travel west with him tomorrow. In the remote border areas, postal and telecommunications are rare. I am afraid that it will be after returning to the east that I can share my future impressions with readers. (October 4)</p>
<h3>隴海路大湖站被匪刧</h3>
<p>Dahu is the first station east of Xuzhou</p>
<p>Stationmaster Abducted but Fortunately Escaped</p>
<p>Xuzhou communication, the eastern section of the Longhai Railway line, often passes through desolate areas, and management and protection are always difficult to ensure. In recent years, banditry has been largely suppressed, and travel is very safe. Unexpectedly, Dahu Station on the line, 18 li from the city, is the first station east of Xuzhou. The second station is Damiao, and the third station is Daxujia. The distance between Damiao and Daxujia is quite far, with the abandoned Huangji Station in between. Bandits lurk here. On the 15th, the bandits learned about the Longhai Railway payroll and went to Dahu Station to rob it. There were only five bandits, who broke into the station at 12 o'clock at night, went straight to the ticket office, grabbed Stationmaster Wu, and asked about the payroll. Wu replied that the station's payroll had already been paid, and his own payroll had to be transferred from Xuzhou Station, and there was no money stored in the station. The bandits did not believe him and opened the iron cabinet, finding only more than ten yuan in silver. They then abducted Wu and his belongings. The bandits were all armed with guns, two with Mauser pistols and three with handguns. They fired shots as a warning. After leaving the station, they took Wu northeast, passing the east end of Damiao Station, crossing a ditch, and reaching the 366-kilometer mark. It was about 4 a.m. on the 16th. A locomotive numbered 1181 was coming from the east. The bandits ordered Wu to hide under the roadbed. After the train passed, the bandits blindfolded Wu and said that they had arrived at Sanbao. They walked east again to Juanshang Village, northeast of the abandoned Huangji Station. They put Wu in a thatched hut and tied his hands and feet. They dug a deep pit under the bed and put him in it, giving him a little food. Then they ordered Wu to write a letter to his family, demanding a 20,000-yuan "meeting gift," and another letter to the Longhai Railway Bureau, demanding 150,000 yuan for his ransom. At this time, the Tongshan County government had dispatched Zhao Benji, the captain of the Sixth Guard Company, to lead his troops east, disembark at Daxujia, and search westward. They also sent Zhang Yaxuan, the deputy commander of the general team, to lead the First Company and a mounted artillery detachment east, searching eastward from Damiao. Both sides searched, and clues were found in Huangji. They entered the village to search. Three of the five bandits were outside and immediately fled. Captain Zhao led his troops to pursue and captured one bandit, Xu Angui, and seized a No. 2 Mauser pistol. Two bandits were still in the thatched hut. Hearing the gunshots outside, they broke out of the door and escaped. Zhao led his troops to intercept them. At this time, Wu's fifteen-year-old daughter, who was in the room under the bed, cried and entered the room, ordering Wu to flee. She then cut Wu's ropes. Wu then escaped, seeing that the location was only half a li from the railway line. He ran to the No. 6 road shed and saw the 71st train coming from the east. Wu stopped the train with a red flag and boarded the train to Xuzhou. He arrived in Xuzhou on the evening of the 17th and reported to Section Chief Dong Yaotang and Section Chief Li Yushu. His hands and feet were bruised. He is currently recuperating. The general section has telegraphed the Zhengzhou Bureau. The Tongshan Guard Team has escorted the captured bandit to the city. The troops will return to the city after the search is completed. Traffic on the eastern section remains normal. The remaining three or four small bandits have already fled far away. (18th)</p>

<h3>County Government Discusses Determining Tax Grain Purity</h3>
<p>The farmland in the county has already been harvested, and the time for collecting rent and taxes is approaching. The county government followed past practice and convened a meeting of district chiefs, representatives of landlords and tenants from each district, and various agencies at 1 p.m. on the 19th in the county government's conference room to discuss the issue of tax grain purity for this year's winter rent, in order to establish a standard for taxation. The Party Department also sent representatives to attend. After comprehensively reviewing the harvest situation in various townships, it was generally agreed that although there was a drought in the summer of this year, fortunately, there was sufficient rainfall during the grain-filling period, and the harvest was considered to be promising. After discussion, it was decided that the purity of the tax grain would be set at 77%, that is, seven dou and seven sheng of rice would be levied for each shi (unit of dry measure). The southern and northern parts of the county would be treated the same. However, strict measures would be taken against landlords who collected extra fees. Those who had no harvest would be exempted from taxation after the landlords verified the facts.</p>

<h3>Lavish Dowry Coveted by Thieves</h3>
<p>Zhang Xuelian, a household in the Huoshaoqiao area west of Erzaohang Town in the First District, has three sons. The eldest son, Zhixiang, and the youngest son, Sanguan, live in the same house. Recently, Sanguan remarried, and his dowry was quite lavish, which aroused the covetousness of thieves. At around 1 a.m. last night, suddenly eight small pirate ships, with more than 30 bandits, came from the southern waterway. They landed and broke down the doors of Sanguan's house, entering each room, tying up all the men and women in the three families, and severely beating Zhixiang, forcing him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Then they smashed the cabinets and searched for silver, foreign currency, clothing, fabrics, and other items. After about an hour, they let out a whoop, took the stolen goods onto the boats, and fled towards Jinjiadang. The three families suffered losses estimated at more than 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Large Number of Unlicensed Opium Smokers Discovered</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Anti-Opium Association has completed the registration and licensing of opium smokers. All opium dens and smoking establishments have also started operating. The Provincial Anti-Opium Association specially dispatched five investigators to join members of the County Anti-Opium Association and police officers, dividing into four groups to investigate whether there were any unlicensed opium smokers smoking in the establishments. After two hours of effort, they discovered a total of 53 such smokers inside and outside the city, including 22 in the First Precinct, 15 in the Second Precinct, and 13 in the Third Precinct. They also found many blank licenses where there were supposed to be licensed smokers. They were all sent to the County Anti-Opium Association for handling on the morning of the 19th. For the smoking establishments that accommodated unlicensed opium smokers, the responsible persons will be sent to the province for military prosecution. The opium smokers smoking without a license will be dealt with by the County Anti-Opium Association according to the severity of their cases.</p>

Yesterday, he also went to Yixing to visit the two famous caves. When the reporter visited Mr. Huang at the hotel, he talked about Article 239 of the Criminal Law, which stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery with a man shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year. This matter has been decided by the Central Political Conference and handed over to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the principle of equality between men and women. After the Legislative Yuan receives the resolution, it will be submitted to the Criminal Law Review Committee for joint review and amendment, and then submitted to the Legislative Assembly for review. In his opinion, adultery is a matter of private morality. To achieve equality between men and women, efforts should be devoted to the political sphere.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Active, Silk Factories Resume Operations</h3>
<p>In recent years, the failure of China's silk industry has reached its extreme, causing the silk factories in the county to close down one after another. Since the autumn, Chinese silk has been slightly more active in overseas markets, and prices have gradually increased. It is reported that the silk market in Lyon, France, is starting to weave spring silk fabrics in spring, and all are competing to purchase spring silk raw materials. Hosiery factories have also started purchasing. Therefore, the silk factories in the county are gradually resuming operations. Currently, 27 factories, including Yongtai No. 1 Factory, Yongtai No. 2 Factory, Huaxin Silk Factory, Yuqi Silk Factory, Dingchang, Zhenyi, Gansheng, and Minfeng, have started operating, presenting a vigorous atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Obstructing Land Price Declaration, Escorted to the Province for Strict Punishment</h3>
<p>The Wuxi urban land price declaration was previously repeatedly telegraphed to the National and Provincial Governments by local public organizations and gentry, citing the people's economic exhaustion and the impossibility of further increasing the burden of land tax, requesting a postponement. The provincial government then approved the temporary suspension of land tax collection. However, the land price declaration is still required for the work of tidying up land implementation. It is currently being urged by the county to complete it within a time limit. Recently, however, Hua Yisan, Wang Jianru, Hou Shaoxian, Cai Yinjie, Hu Dingjing, Xue Suiyan, Gu Chunwu, Wang Jishi, and 1,574 others published an advertisement in the Shen and Xin newspapers, declaring their opposition. After reading the newspaper, Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government was extremely angry and sent a telegram to the County Magistrate Yan, stating that such people were spreading rumors and causing trouble, attempting to provoke discord, which was actually detrimental to public security. He ordered that the initiators be identified and arrested strictly and escorted to the province for investigation. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Yan immediately ordered an investigation. Hua Yisan and the other nine people had already sent a letter to the county government, stating that they had no preconceived notions about the land price declaration and that they had not known about the advertisement in the newspaper beforehand. The county government believed that Hua and others were all highly respected elders and upright local gentry, and that this action was obviously being manipulated by a small number of people. It specially ordered the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation in order to bring them to justice and offered a reward for the arrest of those who spread rumors, caused trouble, and distributed reactionary leaflets. It was also heard that the provincial government had secretly dispatched special agents to Wuxi to investigate a few days ago, who first stayed at the New World Hotel and then moved to other places, keeping their movements very secret. They have already obtained leads from various sources. It is said that the publication of the advertisement was funded with a total of 1,000 yuan (advanced by a certain Qin), drafted by a certain Wang, and that the distribution of leaflets in the market was related to a certain Sun. The special agents sent by the province have returned to the province to report.</p>

<h3>Famine Victims in the Sixth District Surround and Rob Rice Wagons</h3>
<p>The famine victims in the Sixth District previously gathered thousands of people to demand the issuance of wheat seeds and the reduction of rents, causing unrest. Fortunately, the district chief, Hu Sheng, managed to mediate and resolve the situation. Now, on the afternoon of the 18th, a rice robbery occurred again. A rice merchant from Laowu City went to Luhe Town in Taicang to buy rice, which was divided into five wagons for sale in Changshu. Unexpectedly, while passing near Changshou Temple, hundreds of farmers suffering from famine suddenly swarmed forward, surrounding the rice wagons and robbing the first wagon entirely. Later, after the rice merchant earnestly pleaded and issued five copper coins per dan (unit of dry measure), the remaining four wagons were spared. It is said that these famine victims were from Jiejie Township and Changshou Township in the Sixth District, which borders the Yangtze River and has a very strong local culture. They are known as the "Wild Eight Group."</p>
<h3>Electric Plant Adds Rural Lines</h3>
<p>The local electric plant has been in operation for 20 years. Considering the increasing need for electricity in the countryside, it plans to expand its rural lines to meet the needs of rural factories and farmers. The original Meili Electric Plant has suffered losses for years, and its machinery only provides direct current. It is also insufficient to meet the demand, resulting in dim lighting. It has now signed a contract with Changdun Electric Plant to take over operations and extend the lines to Hupu, Zhitang, Wushi, and other areas. It is expected to be completed by the spring of next year. As for the western rural lines, they have now been connected to Dayi Bridge, and electricity is available along the way.</p>

On the 18th, the county government issued a notice stating that in order to prevent sea bandits from using fishing boats, all fishing boats are temporarily prohibited from going to sea during the bandit suppression period.</p>

They throttled him with both hands, causing him to vomit a lot of blood. They then dug and broke his scrotum, and he died immediately. On the 15th, his younger brother, Wu Baozhen, learned of it and reported it to the public security bureau nearby.

Once approved, they will set up an office to handle the matter.</p>

<h3>The Financial Bureau Approves the Revocation of Landlords Paying Property Tax on Behalf of Tenants</h3>
<p>The previous announcement issued by the Municipal Finance Bureau stated that landlords should be responsible for paying property tax on behalf of tenants who delay payment, and that the amount paid on behalf of the tenant could be deducted from the rent. Representatives of landlords from the Shanghai South and Zhabei districts, Wu Baodi and Xu Zuoliang, believed that this measure not only contradicted the previously announced regulations on property tax collection but was also unfair in practice. They jointly submitted a document requesting its revocation, as reported previously. Now, the Finance Bureau has issued approval No. 987, approving the revocation and submitting it to the municipal government to revise and announce the amended regulations on property tax collection. The original approval is recorded below: We have received your submission. Upon review, Article 13 of the Shanghai Property Tax Collection Regulations, which adds [If the tenant delays or fails to pay, the landlord shall be responsible for payment, and the amount paid on behalf of the tenant may be collected from the rent], does not emphasize that the property tax should be paid by the landlord. In fact, it must still be collected from the tenant in accordance with the regulations. Your submission requests revocation, and the Bureau, in order to comply with public opinion, has deleted the above-added clause and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval and revised announcement. You are hereby informed.</p>
<h3>American Aviator Tao Arrives in Shanghai Four Days After Getting Lost Leaving Ganzhou</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Both Himself and the Plane Are Safe and Sound</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, American aviator Lieutenant Tao Sai is an expert in the aviation field. He arrived in China a month ago. Last week, he flew the world's fastest Boeing aircraft from Shanghai to Nanchang, reaching the destination in two hours and fifteen minutes. After completing his business, he flew the original aircraft back to Shanghai from Nanchang at 2:30 PM on Friday the 16th, hoping to reach his destination in one hour and forty-five minutes. Representatives of the American Export Company, Lewis, and Boeing Aircraft Factory expert Peel, left Nanchang by train at 2:00 PM on the same day and arrived in Shanghai the next day via a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Jiujiang, assuming that Lieutenant Tao had already arrived first. However, upon arriving in Shanghai, they could not find him. When they inquired at the Hongqiao Airport, they were told that Mr. Tao had not left Nanchang. Therefore, they assumed that his departure had been postponed due to bad weather and did not think further about Mr. Tao. Unexpectedly, the said gentleman did indeed fly out of Nanchang around 3:00 PM on Friday the 16th. Shortly after, he encountered heavy fog and ascended to an altitude of 11,000 feet. Looking down, he could see nothing. After flying for about an hour and a half, he slowly descended and was shocked to see the plane on the water. He had unknowingly been blown south by the wind to Hangzhou Bay, but Mr. Tao thought it was Lake Tai. So, he continued forward until he reached a mountainous area. Mr. Tao did not recognize the place and decided to find a place to land. He then saw a patch of open space that looked like a rice field, but it was quite small and not large enough for a Boeing aircraft to land. Fortunately, Mr. Tao was skilled in aviation and landed in the field without any damage. A few seconds later, more than a thousand Chinese people surrounded him, and more continued to arrive. While the crowd was pulling him out of curiosity, Mr. Tao almost lost his clothes. Mr. Tao could not speak Chinese, and the villagers could not speak English, so they just looked at each other. Furthermore, the thick fog had not dissipated, and he could not continue his flight. Mr. Tao still did not know where he had landed. On Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday, day and night, Mr. Tao stayed by the plane, not leaving its side. He only had two half-spoiled eggs to eat. This morning (the 19th), Mr. Tao still did not know where he was. He checked the plane's fuel and found that there were only 40 gallons left. The weather was clearer, so Mr. Tao decided to continue his flight. However, the people around him did not disperse, so he tried to take off but stopped repeatedly. Finally, he gestured to persuade the crowd to retreat before he could take off. At that time, Mr. Tao knew that he was on the coast and headed north along the coast. Before long, he reached the prosperous city of Shanghai, circled the city once, and landed safely at the Hongqiao Airport. At that time, there were only 10 to 15 gallons of fuel left in the plane. Although he encountered an accident this time, both Mr. Tao and the plane were safe. However, Mr. Tao was exhausted from being hungry for several days and needs to rest for several days before he can recover.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Women's Association, a Central Government-Designated Legal Organization, Was Established Yesterday</h3>

<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Women's Association, after active preparations by female leaders such as Ms. Lin Kecong, was officially established yesterday.

<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The women's movement in this city had been in a state of decline since the Shanghai Women's Relief Association ceased operations. With women facing both internal and external troubles, it was imperative to strive for self-salvation and national salvation. Lin Kecong, a leader in the women's movement in this city, specifically invited more than 50 advanced women from all walks of life in Shanghai to initiate the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Association as a center for the movement. With the approval of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters, a founders' meeting was held on September 16th at the China Vocational Education Society. At the meeting, Lin Kecong, Jin Shiyin, Zhang Sujun, Zhang Jingyi, Luo Gengyang, Huang Bingpei, Shu Huizhen, Wang Menzhao, Jin Guangmei, Zhang Ju'e, and Zhu Cuiying were elected as members of the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>Established Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the association had been prepared for a long time and approved by the Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters, it has now obtained more than 300 members. Therefore, at 11:00 AM yesterday, a founding meeting was held in the auditorium of the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road. More than 500 people attended, including Lin Kecong, Jin Shiyin, Zhang Suojun, Shu Huizhen, Wang Wenzhao, Jin Qingfen, She Guyin, Huang Yunxia, Shen Xun'er, Gu Songya, Lin Yuxiang, Ye Huijie, Xu Zhurou, Weng Huiyao, Jin Juying, Zhuang Yongfen, Shi Xingyue, Tu Wenying, and guests. The Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters sent a representative, Zhao Erchang, to attend and provide guidance.</p>

<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Lin Kecong gave an opening speech, saying, "Today, our association is officially established. We are very honored to have all the representatives and guests here to provide guidance. Chinese women have been oppressed by patriarchal society and feudal forces for thousands of years. Now, some women have become aware, so in addition to enriching our abilities and seeking our own liberation, we should also unite to overthrow all evils and seek the liberation of the entire nation."</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Speech</p>
<p>Next, Zhao Erchang, a representative of the Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters, gave a speech, saying that the reason why the Central Government has stipulated the establishment of women's associations in various provinces and cities is because China is currently in a difficult situation with both internal and external troubles. Women should organize themselves to directly participate in the revolutionary work or indirectly help the country and promote the family. In addition, women should also participate in social production and promote national construction. Then, the charter was discussed, and directors were elected.</p>
<p>Elected Directors</p>
<p>Lin Kecong, Jin Shiyin, Zhang Sujun, Luo Gengyang, Wang Jiuen, Shu Huizhen, Jin Qingfen, and Wang Wenzhao were elected as directors. Shen Xun'er, She Guyin, and Huang Yunxia were elected as alternate directors. They were then sworn into office, shouted slogans, and dispersed.</p>
<p>Legal Organization</p>
<p>Here is a further exploration of the association's history: The Central Government initially stipulated that the legal women's organizations were the women's associations in various provinces, cities, and counties. Later, they were changed to women's relief associations, and recently they have been changed to women's associations. This city established the Shanghai Municipal Women's Association in 1927. In the summer of 1931, it was reorganized into the Shanghai Municipal Women's Relief Association. Today is the Shanghai Municipal Women's Association. Therefore, the association is the only legal women's organization in this city.</p>
<p>Association's Guidelines</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association has been in the process of initiation and preparation for more than two months. The internal work has been very intense, but it has not published anything in the news. The reporter believes that the association's attitude is very different from that of ordinary women's groups, so he made a special trip to visit it. Here are the attitudes that were explored: 1. Focus on practical work, not empty talk. 2. Do one thing, say one thing, work first, talk later. 3. Prove the association's attitude with facts.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies Chambers of Commerce in All Regions to Pay Attention to the Fuhua Overshoe Factory</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the practice of counterfeiting domestic goods with foreign goods trademarks was previously ordered to be banned by the Ministry of Industry. Now, the Fuhua Rubber Factory's shoe-brand overshoes are actually manufactured by the Japanese Gongda Factory, but they are falsely claiming to be entirely domestic goods. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce specifically notified the Chambers of Commerce in all provinces and regions yesterday, based on an investigation report, to pay attention. The notice stated, "According to a letter from the Shanghai National Rubber Products Industry Association, it has been found that Su Zisu of the Xinyi Chenghao Store in Mantingfang is changing the products of the Japanese Gongda Rubber Factory to Fuhua Factory production, fraudulently registering the Xietu brand trademark with the Trademark Bureau, falsely claiming to be entirely domestic goods, deceiving the public, and selling at low prices everywhere, competing with domestic goods. In response, the Association requests that you publicize this information and kindly forward it to the Chambers of Commerce in all ports to uniformly prohibit the sale in order to maintain domestic goods and show our slight efforts." It was received by the Association. After inquiring with all relevant parties, it was stated on the 3rd of this month by Su Ziying, the manager of Xinyi Cheng Huazahuo Store, that the Fuhua Factory was originally the Japanese Gongda Rubber Factory, which Xinyi took over in March of this year and hired Tanaka Katsu and Tanaka Kazuo as technicians. The takeover price was 55,000 yuan, to be paid in four installments over four years. The first installment was paid on March 1st of this year, with a Jianghai Bank check as proof. However, when asked to submit important books and records such as capital, silver, and purchase records for inspection, he said that they had been sent to the Social Bureau for review. He then went to the Social Bureau to inquire, and they said that the factory's books had never been submitted for review. When the Association planned to visit the factory, a factory employee named Chen came out and said that the factory affairs were managed by Japanese technicians and could not be visited at will. The first installment paid to the Japanese for the takeover was investigated, totaling 13,750 yuan. Only 3,000 yuan from the Qishun Yuzhuang on April 9 was cashed by the Japanese Tanaka Katsu. The remaining 10,750 yuan was still collected by Xinyi Cheng, which formed the Fuhua Factory from the takeover of the Gongda Factory. It was also found that when a labor dispute occurred at the factory in September, Song Yexian of the Rubber Products Industry Union went to investigate. According to his report, the factory owner was Kotanaka, the Ota was Otanaka, the engineer was the Japanese Ooyoshi Ryo, the drying room was the Japanese Koyoshi Ryo, and the foreman was also Japanese, named Yamamoto, etc. If this is true, then Tanaka Katsu and Tanaka Kazuo are not technicians, and there are other technicians. The Association believes that the above points are extremely noteworthy and specially sends this notice to all locations, only to inform all circles to pay attention."</p>
<h3>US Consul-General to Shanghai Watson and Wife Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Fake Trademarks and Adulterated Coal Briquettes Sold</h3>
<p>Huarongda Accused</p>
<p>The Huarongda Coal Store, operated by Huarongda at 179 Rue Poncet in the French Concession, has been in business for many years and is quite prosperous. It has been doing business with the Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory, but suddenly stopped trading on June 1st of this year. The factory became suspicious and sent an employee, Qiu Guozhen, to secretly investigate. It was discovered that Huarongda owner Hua Rongmu had recently imitated the red bamboo strips of the factory and purchased discarded trademark papers sold by the Zhonghua Factory. He was using inferior coal briquettes from other sources and selling them under the Zhonghua Factory name for profit. The Zhonghua Factory reported the situation to the French Concession Police Station, which dispatched detective Lu Changsheng to the Huarongda store. He found more than a hundred of the counterfeit bamboo strips, dozens of trademark papers, and two baskets of counterfeit coal briquettes that had already been filled. He took the owner Hua Rongmu into custody. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Eighth Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. The complainant, Qiu Guozhen, representative of the Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory, stated, "After investigating and clarifying the circumstances of the defendant's counterfeiting, the defendant Hua Rongmu confessed: I have always sold Zhonghua coal briquettes. Since June 1st of this year, another runner has been soliciting business, so I no longer directly purchase goods from the Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory. All the empty baskets in the store are my own, and the two filled baskets are not mine, and so on." After Presiding Judge Wu Fangyan reviewed the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded and rescheduled the hearing for the 24th.</p>
<h3>The Sixteenth Batch of Expelled Overseas Chinese from Japan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese Levy a Handling Fee of 24 Yuan Per Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Chinese Students Studying in Japan Handle the Return Registration for Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The sixteenth batch of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, Chen Youren, Wu Ziying, Ren Fuwan, and five others, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Tsukuba Maru from Tokyo at 4:00 PM last night. The ship docked at the Waibaidu Bridge Wharf. After disembarking, the refugees dispersed to the Laogong Inn at the 16th Pier and the Fuxing Inn in Hongkou. The situation was quite wretched. According to overseas Chinese Chen Youren, the reporter from the Nichinichi News Agency stated that there are still more than ten overseas Chinese in Tokyo who have been detained by the Oshima-cho and Sunamachi Police Stations, waiting to be deported on the next ship. The Japanese treat Chinese people with all kinds of oppressive measures. This time, they even declared that all overseas Chinese who have not been expelled and wish to work in the country must first pay a handling fee of 24 yuan, otherwise they will be deported. However, the overseas Chinese in foreign countries earn meager wages from their hard work, barely enough to eat, let alone have extra money to pay this large sum. Therefore, there are now about 200 overseas Chinese in Tokyo, Yokohama, and other places who will inevitably be deported en masse. Fortunately, the Chinese Students Association in Japan, seeing the Japanese's cruelty, stepped forward to handle the registration for the overseas Chinese. According to reports, after registration, they will submit a request to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing to gather the deported overseas Chinese and send them to Anhui to build Lecun for land reclamation.</p>
<h3>Statement from the Maritime Administration Bureau Regarding the Handling of Registration for Low-Ranking Seamen</h3>
<p>Petitions from Various Seamen's Organizations</p>
<p>Uncoordinated Wording and Inappropriate Terminology According to the Guowen News Agency, yesterday's newspaper reported that various seamen's organizations in this port had jointly petitioned for the exemption of the handbook fee. The reporter made a special trip to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau to inquire. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, regarding the registration of seamen, the Bureau has been handling it in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Seamen" promulgated by the Ministry. The regulations were promulgated by the Ministry of Transportation on October 1st of the 20th year and filed with the Executive Yuan. Since the implementation of the regulations, due to the large number of seamen and the complicated registration procedures, registration of senior seamen was started first. Now that the registration of senior seamen is about to be completed, the registration of low-ranking seamen has been started since October 1st of this year. Quite a few people have come to register in accordance with the regulations. As for the collection of the "Seamen's Handbook Fee" of two yuan, it is entirely in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations, [The following two types of seamen, those in the deck department and the engine department, who are employed on ships for the first time, shall apply for the issuance of a seamen's handbook at the same time as applying for approval from the shipping registry port maritime administration bureau; those who have already been employed on ships before the implementation of these regulations shall apply for the issuance of a supplementary seamen's handbook. 1. Deck Department: Captain, Chief Officer, Second Officer, Third Officer, Helmsman, Boatswain, Seaman; 2. Engine Department: Chief Engineer, First Assistant Engineer, Second Assistant Engineer, Third Assistant Engineer, Oiler, Fireman, Chief Fireman, Fireman.] The petitions from various seamen's organizations state that the Bureau is extorting the handbook fee, which is not only ignorant of the regulations but also inappropriate terminology. It is true that seamen's salaries are low. The attached schedule to the regulations originally listed six other fees. In order to reduce the burden on seamen, the Ministry ordered their cancellation in November of the 22nd year. Furthermore, the seamen's handbook fee for ships under 50 gross tons has also been reduced by one yuan with the approval of the Bureau to show compassion. The Bureau has printed the regulations for the understanding of all seamen and will distribute them immediately for public inspection to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>New Building of the Great China Department Store</h3>
<p>Constructed by Fu Kee Construction Company</p>
<p>Shanghai Great China Co., Ltd. purchased land at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road to build a department store. The design and drawings were done by Kee &amp; Choon Architects.

In addition, a basement is also built, all of which will also be used as a market. These are all innovations in Shanghai. The owner of Fu Kee Construction, Tao Guilin, is a well-known builder in this city. He recently completed the 22-story building of the Four-Bank Joint Savings Society on Jing'an Temple Road, as well as the Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and the Qinghai Naval Shipyard, all of which have earned the satisfaction of the owners and the praise of society.

<h3>China United Bank Acting as Agent for Liyuan New Village</h3>
<p>China United Trust &amp; Savings Bank, located on Jiangxi Road, in order to solve the problem of housing for the public, previously established China United Village on West Tiyuhui Road. Its excellent layout and superior equipment have long been renowned in Shanghai. Recently, it was entrusted by the owner to act as an agent for the Liyuan New Village on two sections of Yuyuan Road. The location of Liyuan is on the main avenue of Yuyuan Road, connected to the city center in the east and to the suburbs in the west. Zhaofeng Garden and Liwa Village are both nearby. In addition, the municipal administration is excellent, and the beauty of the environment is unparalleled. The convenience of transportation goes without saying. As for the facilities for water, electricity, and gas, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, Electricity Company, and Gas Company provide them, making them very convenient to use. The land in the garden is divided into several areas according to precise planning and based on various uses, using the most economical method. The areas vary in size, from two or three acres to one acre. All the rest are uniformly square and suitable for building houses and shops. The selling price is also very low, which is in line with the desire of investors for stable profits. Moreover, it is really impossible to find a small, square piece of land in the Yuyuan Road area. Now that Liyuan is being divided and sold, it really meets the needs of the public. However, there are only eleven areas of land in the garden. Those who are interested in investing and building houses can go to the Real Estate Department of China United Trust &amp; Savings Bank as soon as possible to order, so as not to miss this good opportunity.</p>

<h3>Illegal Organizations such as Bao Dayong</h3>

<p>Deadline to remove signs and advertisements is within fifteen days</p>
<p>When the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was ordered to investigate the Yache Night Market Agency, it discovered many gold and silver goods trading markets similar to exchanges, such as China, Central, and Second Exchange Companies, and the Yache East Agency of Shanghai Gold Bullion Company (ie, Bao Dayong). It was reported to the Social Bureau and then to the Ministry of Industry for handling. Now it has been ordered to be banned. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry Order to Ban The Municipal Social Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry, stating that China Exchange Company, Central Exchange Company, Shanghai Gold Bullion Company, and Bao Dayong Gold Shop (or translated as Yache East Agency) are engaged in gold bullion trading without approval and in violation of regulations, and should be banned immediately. The order immediately instructed the above four companies to cease business. The order stated: "It has been found that this Bureau previously received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry regarding the case of the Yache East Goods and Silver Night Market Agency, whose organization is illegal and should be shut down. It has been reported by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce that this company is similar in nature to the Yache East Agency and has not been registered and approved by the Ministry of Industry. It is requested to review and submit it to the Ministry of Industry, etc." It has been reported to the Ministry of Industry, which issued an instruction, Commercial Letter No. 29647, which stated, "The report is noted.

Shanghai Gold Bullion Company, located at 55 Haining Road, is a British company; 4. Bao Dayong Gold Shop (ie, Yache East Agency), located at 15 Xinkang Road, is a Chinese company. However, when the reporter investigated, in addition to Shanghai Gold Bullion Company acting as an agent to buy and sell gold bullion, China and Central Exchange Companies were acting as agents to buy and sell ticket gold and Hulk stocks. According to China Exchange Company, it is a member of the Foreign Merchants Broker Association. However, Bao Dayong Gold Shop claimed to be a Chinese company and denied being the Yache East Agency. However, its telephone number is 16005, which is listed in the telephone directory as the Yache East Agency. All four companies denied having received instructions from the Social Bureau.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Zhu Lan Jia Did Not Embezzle or Underreport the Selling Price</h3>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Lan Jia wrote to this newspaper, stating: Dear Sir, I have read a news item in your newspaper on November 16th, in the Shanghai News section, titled [Lawyer Zhu Lan Jia Accused of Underreporting Land Selling Price]. It does not conform to the facts. The truth is as follows: Lv Tao Baobao had previously authorized Gu Changsheng to be his full agent to transfer the original reclamation and original possession rights of the land he occupied. In November of last year, Gu transferred the task to this lawyer to introduce Mr. Zhang Jun Dexiang to sign a contract for the transfer of the land possession rights. At that time, it was clearly stated in the contract that all procedures for obtaining licenses, paying supplementary prices, increasing grain, and exchanging certificates were not related to Tao Baobao. Subsequently, Mr. Zhang immediately paid the price to the official property bureau of the Ministry of Finance and obtained the ministerial certificate in accordance with the law, and requested the Land Bureau to supplement the price, increase grain, and exchange certificates. Until March of this year, this lawyer was entrusted by Mr. Zhang to sell the land to a Mr. Huang, agreeing to use the land practice certificate as the subject of the transaction, so the selling price was higher. Unexpectedly, Tao Baobao, influenced by people with ulterior motives, actually fabricated the facts and filed a private prosecution against this lawyer for breach of trust. For the sake of self-defense, this lawyer submitted all the evidence to the court and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. A few days ago, Tao Baobao, knowing that his case was weak, was willing to publish an apology in the newspaper and announce the facts, requesting reconciliation. As for all the procedures, he still took care of the performance of the contract signed between Changsheng and the Zhang family. This lawyer felt that he was ignorant, was used by others, and was worthy of sympathy, so he agreed to reconciliation. All the important statements of apology made by Tao Baobao to this lawyer have been published in various newspapers in facing advertisements from the 14th to the 17th of this month. All the facts have evidence to prove that there is absolutely no breach of trust or underreporting of the selling price. In the news item, it was said that he entrusted Lawyer Zhu to handle the increase in taxes and sales, and as a result, it was discovered that Zhu had breached the trust and underreported the selling price, etc., which was obviously inaccurate and damaged the reputation of this lawyer, which is very regrettable to read. Moreover, on the day this news item was published, an advertisement of apology from Tao Baobao was published in the advertisement column of your newspaper, which proves that the record of this news item is inaccurate, and there is no doubt about it. I have always heard that your newspaper is extremely cautious in publishing news. Accordingly, I enclose a copy of the apology advertisement published in your newspaper and send this special letter to inform you of the truth. I hope that your newspaper will publish the entire letter to the public to restore the reputation of this lawyer. Sincerely, To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Lawyer Zhu Lan Jia, November 19, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Second Petition Delegation of Songhan Water Drawing Petition Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Dalianwan Road Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>Most of the Stolen Goods Were Seized</p>
<p>Jiang Yingwo, a Ningbo woman living at No. 7, Lane 547, Dalianwan Road, was suddenly invaded by two bandits at about 9:00 am on the 8th of this month. They robbed her of banknotes, silver dollars, and gold jewelry worth 644 yuan and fled without a trace. The case was reported to the Huishan Police Station. At 12:50 pm the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Liu Shishan arrested a bandit named Zhang Chunsheng, a Ningbo native, in Dongyouheng Road. Zhang confessed that he had mailed part of the stolen gold jewelry and pearls to Li Gao, a Lu woman living at a certain number on Maite Hesitu Road. Liu rushed to the address, found a jewelry box, and learned that his accomplice, He Lesheng, a Pudong native, was hiding at No. 7, Dajing Road, Jiumu Diji, in the Chinese area. He also went to meet with the detectives of the Public Security Bureau under the jurisdiction of the Civil Administration, and continued to capture He, as well as the original stolen diamond gold rings and other items that had been pawned in various pawnshops, and brought them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Engineering Bureau, stated that the defendant, Zhang Shousheng, had known the plaintiff, Jiang Ying, for some time. At that time, he and He Lesheng knocked on the door and entered the house. Seeing that Jiang was still in bed, He immediately covered Jiang's face with a blanket to prevent her from making noise, and held a rope, saying that if she shouted, he would strangle her with the rope. Therefore, Jiang was afraid of being murdered by them and had to let the two defendants rummage through the boxes and cabinets and rob her of the aforementioned jewelry and 80 silver dollars. He then presented the stolen goods for inspection and requested an adjournment. Liu Shishan then reported the process of solving the case, and the plaintiff Jiang Ying, the servant woman Wu Mao, gave a detailed account of the robbery situation at that time. Li Gao also testified that she had known Zhang Chunsheng for only a week, and at that time he temporarily deposited an iron box with her, and she did not know that it was stolen. When asked of the two defendants, their confessions were vague. Judge Wu then ordered that they be returned to custody and the case be reviewed again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of a Russian Man Driving and Killing Someone</h3>
<p>Xu Jinrong, a native of Suzhou, 59 years old, lived at No. 7, Jinxiu Road, Ximen, and had a Kaiyuan Electrochemical Factory in West Shanghai. At about 7:00 pm on the 16th of this month, Xu was riding in a private chartered car, driven by the driver Yang Shaorong, on his way home from the factory. Unexpectedly, when he passed the intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin Road, traveling from west to east, a Russian man, Boduogaofu (who is now a musician at the Yangzi Hotel Dance Hall), suddenly drove a car with license plate number 6549 at high speed from behind. He was unable to brake in time, and the chartered car was overturned. Xu and the driver Yang Shaorong were both seriously injured. The Jing'an Temple Police Station received the report and sent the injured master and servant to the Red Cross Hospital. Unfortunately, Xu was too seriously injured at the time and could not be rescued. He died shortly after. The next morning, the First Special District Local Court dispatched Prosecutor Tang to inspect the body at the mortuary, confirming that the body was genuine, and learned that the Russian man was suspected of negligence. The police station was instructed to file a public prosecution. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted the Russian man to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court for prosecution. First, the police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin reported that the defendant was being prosecuted for negligent homicide under Article 291 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that it had been verified that the brakes of the car involved in the accident were slightly damaged, and the wheels were slightly different from those of ordinary cars. At the time, the deceased was hit and fell out of the car, 12 feet and 3 inches away from the scene of the accident. It was verified that Xu's brain was bleeding and his skull was broken. The chartered car driver Yang Shaorong suffered injuries to his left chest and right leg and is still being treated in the hospital. Judge Wu Tingqi asked the defendant Boduogaofu for information. Boduogaofu confessed that he was Russian, 29 years old. At the time, his car was driving through the area, and another car was coming from the opposite direction. Its lights were very bright, which made him unable to see the chartered car in front, so this unfortunate incident occurred. He also hired a lawyer to handle the case. Judge Wu announced the verdict in court, stating that the facts were clear and ordering Boduogaofu to pay a fine of 600 yuan. The civil litigation part was transferred to the civil court for trial. Within the appeal period, he was allowed to post a bail of 1,000 yuan to be released from custody.</p>

Representatives from various circles were invited to visit. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Building Interior</p>
<p>The building has twenty-two stories above ground, is approximately 300 feet high, and occupies an area of 1.6 acres. The total volume of the building is 2,020,000 cubic feet. The central portion of the ground floor and mezzanine floor are the offices of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society. Floors two through nineteen are leased to the International Hotel.

All four walls of the tower are glass windows. From the tower, one can see rows of rooftops, crisscrossing streets, and the entire city. The dome of the tower is made of gold glazed porcelain tiles, radiating golden light and dazzling the eyes. Above it, the national flag flies, surveying the entire city of Shanghai. There is also a basement floor for vaults. The entire building uses steel pillars as a framework, with the outer walls built with Taishan facing bricks, and the inner walls and floors are paved with marble. Most of the materials used were domestically produced. The construction cost is estimated at 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Four Banks Relocation</p>
<p>The offices of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society that relocated yesterday include the Society's General Office, Preparation Treasury, Shanghai Western District Branch, Shanghai Real Estate Department, and Corporate Research Department. The newly added safe deposit boxes are also located there. All departments are located on the ground floor and have been prepared for formal business operations. The Chairman of the Society, Qian Xinzhi, led many staff members in welcoming guests and guiding them to tour the various facilities. The savings department counters are paved with marble and inlaid with steel patterns, making them beautiful and clean. The lighting inside the building is also soft and pleasant.</p>
<p>Treasury Facilities</p>
<p>The vault is located in the basement. Upon entering, one goes down the stairs to the right.

A small staircase leads to the upper floors, as floors twenty and twenty-one are for the electrical and water facilities. All water and electricity for the entire building are self-sufficient. The elevator equipment is also the latest type. Passengers wishing to reach a certain floor press the button, and the elevator stops on that floor. The doors also open automatically. If there are passengers getting on or off halfway, pressing the button will also automatically stop the elevator. The speed of ascent and descent is also fast, traveling 500 feet per minute.

It is said that the hotel will officially open on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>The Entire Case of the Kidnapping of Madam Yu Baoshan Tang in the French Concession Solved</h3>
<p>Kidnappers apprehended in Suzhou and Shanghai</p>
<p>The victim has been safely rescued</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM on the 21st of last month, Madam Yu, the elderly female head of the Yu Baoshan Tang family, a wealthy Cantonese merchant living at No. 60 Rue Massenet in the French Concession, was kidnapped just as she was leaving her home to go to church to pray in her private car. As soon as she left the house and arrived near the gate of the Jiangsu High Court Branch, she was suddenly kidnapped by three bandits and forced into a car rented in advance from the White Russia Road branch of the Yellow Taxi Company, car number 12032, and disappeared without a trace. The details have been reported in this newspaper. However, since the incident occurred almost a month ago, no leads could be obtained due to the cunning nature of the kidnappers. But thanks to the efforts of Chinese and Western police officers in the French Concession Police Department, the entire case was finally solved yesterday, and the victim was safely rescued. Multiple kidnappers were arrested in Suzhou and Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Madam Believes in Religion</p>
<p>No. 60 Rue Massenet, west of the Jiangsu High Court Branch in the French Concession, is the mansion of Yu Baoshan Tang, a Cantonese merchant known for his wealth. The female head of the family, Madam Yu, although over sixty years old, is energetic and a devout Catholic. Every weekend and holiday, she would go to church to participate in Mass without fail. She is frugal by nature, and only uses a private car (Municipal License No. 757, Concession No. 830) for transportation when going out.</p>
<p>Kidnapped into a Car</p>
<p>On the 21st of last month, a Sunday, she got up at 7:00 AM. After washing up and having a quick breakfast, it was already past 8:00 AM. She immediately got into the car, and the driver, Lu Huixiang, started pulling the car eastward. As soon as they reached the gate of No. 5, west of the High Court Branch, three kidnappers suddenly rushed up, each with a pistol, ordering the driver to stop the car. At the same time, two bandits kidnapped Madam Yu into a yellow car parked on the side of the road, and sped eastward. The car number was 12032.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>At that time, the driver, Lu Huixiang, was stunned when he saw his employer being kidnapped. After a long time, he regained his composure and hurriedly pulled the empty car back home to report the incident. The family then reported the incident to the Louza Police Station in charge. The detectives immediately launched an investigation in all directions, but it was like chasing a phantom. The police urgently notified the Public Concession and the Public Security Bureau of various branch police stations to be on the lookout, but there were no traces. It was not until about 12:00 noon on the same day that the car was found near Gaolang Bridge and Lan Road, but it was empty. The car driver, Cai Amao, also disappeared at the same time.</p>
<p>Kidnappers Rent a Car</p>
<p>Earlier, at around 7:20 AM on the same day, two uninvited customers suddenly came to the White Russia Road branch of the famous Yellow Taxi Company. One was wearing a dark green silk shirt and a melon cap, and the other, wearing a gray long gown, followed behind. They claimed to rent a car to go to the Shanjiayuan near North Mud City Bridge. While speaking, they took out a silver dollar from their pocket and paid the station attendant. The station attendant immediately sent the car driver Cai Amao (36 years old, from Tongzhou) to drive the concession license No. 12032 car, and the two men got into the car and drove straight away.</p>
<p>Close Surveillance</p>
<p>Since the incident occurred, the French Concession police authorities have attached great importance to it. In addition, the victim, Madam Du, is the mother-in-law of Wan Langdeng, the current deputy detective of the French Concession Police Department's theft case team, so the nature of the case is particularly important. All detectives of the French Concession Police Department were searching for clues day and night, but due to the cunning and treacherous nature of the bandits, there were no important leads. Moreover, due to the police's close surveillance, there was no room for contact.</p>
<p>Sudden Letter</p>
<p>Until half a month ago, the Yu family suddenly received a letter from the bandits, signed by Wang Baoduan, Commander-in-Chief of the Hong Army. The letter ordered the family to redeem the hostage at the Sanxin Hotel in Suzhou. The Yu family once sent people to Suzhou, but the bandits did not show up, so they returned to Shanghai. Recently, the Yu family received a second letter, agreeing to negotiate at the original hotel in Suzhou at 1:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Contact Symbol</p>
<p>The bandit's letter also specified the identification for the person coming to contact them. They must bring two bottles of Huadiao wine, five cans of Hongxibao cigarettes, and a bamboo basket containing oranges, pears, and other items. After receiving the letter, the Yu family secretly reported it to the French Concession Police Department. The captain first sent two female detectives, then Zhang Ziying and Zhou Buguang, disguised as family members of the Yu family, arrived in Suzhou at 10:30 AM. Unexpectedly, as soon as the two detectives got off the train,</p>
<p>Confession of Suspects</p>
<p>They discovered two suspicious young men on the platform, one wearing a suit and the other wearing a long gown. The two detectives identified them and immediately arrested them. Together with the station chief police, they escorted them to the Suzhou Public Security Bureau. After detailed questioning by the Suzhou Detective Team, one confessed to the name Wang Fugeng and the other confessed to the name Kui Zhongying, and they directly admitted to contacting the ransom. They immediately confessed that the victim was still in a pavilion room at No. 386 Yulin Road in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Two Detectives Cooperate in Arresting</p>
<p>After Zhang and Zhou learned of the location of the hostage, they immediately reported to Shanghai via long-distance telephone. It was already 7:00 PM. The chief of the Western District Detective Section Rao Boze, Deputy Detective Wan Langdeng, Chinese Inspector Jin Jiulin, along with Detective Qian Yumin, Deputy Detective Su Shichi, Wang Ronggui, Zhou Bingcheng, Detectives Jiang Changwen, Zhang Chunsheng, Yang Yilong, Qin Youyu, Yin Baoke, Jin Bingwen, Wang Maoliu, and Public Concession Detective Su Changsheng, Detective Jin Wanrong, Liu Zisheng, Tang Pengfei, and many members of the reserve team, rushed to the address. When they arrived at the destination, they surrounded the house, and Detective Zhang Chunsheng bravely rushed in first. The bandits in the pavilion room and upstairs had already heard the police and opened fire to resist arrest. Detective Zhang was shot in the thigh, but at this time the bandits' courage had been broken, and the detectives took advantage of the situation and rushed in.</p>
<p>Four Bandits Captured</p>
<p>Four bandits were captured, and two pistols and more than 80 rounds of ammunition were seized. The victim was safely rescued from the pavilion room, but she had fallen and injured herself in shock. The four bandits were Lin De, 30 years old, Tao Shuigen, 41 years old, Jiang Huizhi, 34 years old, and another bandit Zhou Juqin, 24 years old, all from Shaoxing. Lin was injured in the waist, and Tao had a finger broken. Together with the victim, they were all sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Suzhou Criminals Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>The two bandits captured in Suzhou were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:00 PM. The French Concession Police Department sent many detectives to meet them, and requested the Baoshan Road Branch Bureau to send many officers to protect them. They arrived at midnight, and were immediately escorted onto the police car and driven straight to the Louza Police Station for investigation. At the same time, the remaining accomplices were being closely pursued.</p>
<h3>New Seedling Scam</h3>
<p>Mortgaging Land by Calling a Deer a Horse</p>
<p>Setting Boundary Markers to Deceive the Owner</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of seedling scam has been discovered in Shanghai, and the content, organization, and scale are very large. The method of deception is to first acquire a piece of land at a low value, then draw a forged map, graft flowers onto trees, and call a deer a horse, thus turning it into a valuable piece of land in a good location. At this time, accomplices are scattered to mortgage it everywhere. When there is a gullible owner, on the eve of the owner's visit to inspect the land, people are sent in advance to secretly set up boundary markers. After the inspection is completed, they are removed. The most important guarantor for the mortgage is also an accomplice. Once the fraudulent loan is obtained, the guarantor's company also closes down, making it impossible for the deceived to investigate. Once the deceived are trapped, it involves tens of thousands of yuan. The police authorities in both the Chinese and Concession areas have begun to conduct close investigations.</p>
<h3>Ye Rongjun, Owner of the Hua Feng Military Uniform Factory, Suddenly Assassinated</h3>
<p>Thugs Carried Ye Downstairs and Fired a Shot</p>
<p>The bullet entered from the right side of the neck and exited from the back</p>
<p>Ye was seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment</p>
<p>Ye Rongjun, owner of the Hua Feng Military Uniform Factory at the intersection of Qingyun Road and Zhiyuan Road in Zhabei, a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang, 42 years old, has one son and three daughters. In addition to running the military uniform factory, Ye also co-owns the Hongda Fruit Shop with friends at No. 21, Lane 171, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou (i.e., Huaianli), specializing in selling American fruits, and the business is very prosperous. Ye and his family also live upstairs at No. 21 Huaianli. At around 7:00 AM yesterday, two men suddenly came, speaking with a Ningbo accent, posing as visitors and asking for Ye. At that time, there was only a maid downstairs and Shao Jingguo, the fruit shop's accountant, had already gotten up. They asked the men their intentions, and they claimed to be visiting Ye Rongjun. Ye had not yet gotten up, so the maid told them to wait a moment and went upstairs to inform him. Before the maid could finish her reply, the two men suddenly pulled out pistols and imprisoned the maid and Shao in the downstairs side room, and called in another thug outside the door to guard them with a gun. The two thugs immediately went upstairs, broke into Ye's bedroom, and dragged Ye out of bed. Ye was awakened from his sleep and could not resist. He allowed the thugs to carry him downstairs. When they reached the landing of the staircase in the guest hall, Ye tried to struggle. One of the bandits, without asking any questions, raised his gun and fired a shot at Ye's neck. The bullet entered from the right side of the neck and exited from the back. Ye immediately bled profusely and fell to the ground seriously injured. The thugs, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, rushed upstairs, and with the thug downstairs, fled out the door. Shao and others witnessed this scene and were terrified. They hurriedly reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, who sent detectives to the scene. The thugs had already fled far away. The detectives urgently sent Ye to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and conducted an investigation at the scene of the incident, and asked about the appearance of the murderers. They reported to the police station to pursue the fugitives. As for why this murder occurred, it could not be ascertained because Ye was still unconscious.</p>
<h3>The Cai Yangqi Case is Almost Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Lang Zuyin Consistently Refuses to Appear</p>
<p>Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective at the Old City Gate Police Station, handled a theft case at the Longshun Gongdihuo Trading Company on Fujian Road this summer. Cai Yangqi, a Chongming native who worked at the company, was highly suspected and was arrested. After repeated hearings by the First Special District Court, it was deemed irrelevant and he was found not guilty. Cai was released home, and his wife then hired a lawyer to sue Lang Zuyin for abusing his power and injuring her husband. The First Special Court has opened the court ten times, but has been unable to conduct the trial because Lang Zuyin has refused to appear. Although the court has submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice to transfer the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the British Ambassador, requesting that the Municipal Council order Detective Lang to surrender to the court for legal trial, this negotiation has not yet yielded any results. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the trial again. Because Detective Lang had not yet surrendered, Judge Liu ordered a postponement to December 9th in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Barber's Wife Swallows Sleeping Pills</h3>
<p>Early Treatment Saves Her Life</p>
<p>Huang Youcai Repeatedly Uses Poisonous Schemes</p>
<p>Cao Kaifu, a barber from Yangzhou at the Guoji Barber Shop at No. 1063 Jing'an Temple Road, his wife, Xie Xiuhua, from Guangdong, 22 years old, specializes in manicures. Everyone in the barber industry knows about "Little Guangdong". Xie is currently a manicurist at the Yangzi Hotel hair salon. The couple lives together at No. 520 Zhejiang Road. Cao Kaifu has a friend named Huang Youcai, from Jiangbei, who is a barber at the Dadong Barber Shop. Because the two are very friendly, Huang often visits Cao's home. Seeing that Xie is somewhat attractive, he has bad intentions, often flirting with her and inviting her to go to a hotel. After being rejected, he harbors resentment. At 8:00 PM on the 8th of this month, when Xie left home to work at the Yangzi Hotel, Huang Youcai suddenly appeared while passing the entrance of Ciheli on Yunnan Road, holding a small bottle and throwing it at her face. Xie blocked it with her hand, causing the bottle to fall to the ground. The contents of the bottle were all corrosive acid. The bottle broke and the acid spilled out. Xie's third toe on her right foot was injured by the acid. Huang fled immediately. Xie reported the incident to the Old City Gate Police Station, who ordered detectives to arrest Huang, but he was nowhere to be found. After this incident, Xie resigned from her job at the Yangzi Hotel and went to work at Guoji. On Friday afternoon of last week, at 3:40 PM, Zhu Yucheng, the owner of the Qihua Barber Shop on Guangxi Road, from Jiangbei, called Xie Xiuhua, asking her to withdraw the charges against Huang. If she did not withdraw the charges, Huang would harm them and then flee to Qingdao. After being threatened, she was extremely frightened and bought nine sleeping pills, which she swallowed at about 7:00 PM on the 17th of this month. After the poisoning occurred, she was sent to Guangren Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, the treatment was early, and there was no major problem. After receiving a notice from the hospital, the Old City Gate Police Station sent Detective Zhao Ziren and Detective Xie Guisheng to investigate and arrested Huang and Zhu. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the previous events and charged Huang under Article 294 of the Criminal Law and Zhu under Article 318 of the Criminal Law. He also said that Xie Xiuhua was still unable to leave the hospital, so she could not attend court today, and requested a postponement. Huang Youcai confessed that he was asking Cao for 50 yuan that he owed him, which led to an argument. On the 8th, Xie called him to talk at the scene of the incident, but Xie used acid to splash him, which he blocked with his hand, but his clothes and face were injured. He denied that he had flirted with her and been rejected. Zhu Yucheng confessed that he was acting as a mediator because both parties were friendly and there were no threatening words. The head of the Criminal Court, Qian Hongye, reviewed the confessions and ordered the case to be postponed for one week. Zhu Yucheng was released on 500 yuan bail, and Huang Youcai was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Liang Tongfang Hopes to Continue His Studies</h3>
<p>Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association Asks Various Organizations for Assistance</p>
<p>Mr. Liang is Currently Receiving Treatment for His Injuries at the Civilian Sanatorium</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association believes that the patriotic hero Liang Tongfang's injuries have not yet healed and need to be recuperated. At the same time, Liang aspires to continue his studies and hopes to pursue further education. Yesterday, they sent letters to various organizations and the Civilian Sanatorium requesting assistance. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Various Organizations</p>
<p>The association's letter to various organizations states: "We respectfully inform you that the patriotic hero Liang Tongfang was released on bail on November 17th. However, his limbs are injured, which affects his livelihood. Our association believes that Mr. Liang sacrificed himself for the service of society, and society should jointly bear the responsibility for his aftermath. We plan to raise one thousand yuan to help him establish a career. Mr. Liang has stated that he aspires to study in order to pursue further education, so that in the future, although he cannot support society with actions, he can still help the country with theories. Our association admires his lofty aspirations and is even more respectful. However, the cost of schooling is indeed not small. Mr. Liang's father has been disabled for a long time, and his old mother is also frail. Although there is no burden of raising children, there is the regret of supporting parents. Mr. Liang has contributed to society, and we members of society should comfort him, so as to eliminate his family concerns and focus his mind on advancement. We dare to ask for donations from benevolent people to allow the patriotic hero to finally have a home. This is to reward those who bravely do what is right and to save the fate of the country."</p>
<p>Letter to the Lawyers Association</p>
<p>Letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association and the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association of Chinese Citizens states: "We respectfully inform you that on November 14th (October 29th), we received your reply, and we admire your impartiality and the heroic words overflowing in your expressions. Our fellow villager Liang Tongfang was released on bail by our association on the 17th of this month. Once his injured body has recovered slightly, we will send him to thank you in person. We respectfully send this letter to express our gratitude, hoping that you will appreciate it."</p>
<p>Letter to Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Letter to Dr. Chen Shaohua states: "Great Doctor Shaohua, we admire your reputation and are deeply impressed. We have long heard of your benevolence and admire you even more. Now, the patriotic hero Liang Tongfang has sacrificed himself for society and has suffered injuries to his limbs, which have not healed to this day. If not for a doctor with compassion and a reputation for chivalry, Mr. Liang cannot escape from the suffering of illness. We dare to ask you to introduce him to the Civilian Sanatorium and request that they provide free treatment. In these times, there are few virtuous people. To cultivate virtuous people is to build the country, and to heal virtuous people is to heal the country. We respectfully hope for your permission and wish you well."</p>
<p>Letter to the Sanatorium</p>
<p>Letter to the Civilian Sanatorium states: "We respectfully inform you that Dr. Chen Shaohua has introduced our fellow villager Liang Tongfang to your hospital for treatment. We hope that you will perform the surgery and allow Mr. Liang to escape the sea of suffering as soon as possible. The Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association of Shanghai respectfully submits this to the Director of the Shanghai Civilian Sanatorium."</p>
<h3>Chinese Student in Berlin Shoots German Girlfriend</h3>
<p>After Wounding Girlfriend, He Commits Suicide</p>
<p>The Result of a Tragic Love Affair</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 19th: A Chinese student named Hu Changyang (transliteration) used a pistol to wound his fifteen-year-old German girlfriend, and then shot himself with a gun. The German girl has been sent to the hospital for treatment, and her condition is very critical. It is said that the two were very close, but the girl suddenly wanted to separate, resulting in this unfortunate outcome. Therefore, this tragedy is probably caused by jealousy. All newspapers have reported this incident, but do not take sides and recognize it as a major misfortune in life.</p>
<h3>Police Detective Dares to Privately Pass Opium</h3>
<p>After Investigation, He is Expelled and Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Yu Zilian, a patrolman at a police station in the South City, suddenly went to the detention center of the District Court the other day to visit his friend Chen Sanyuan, who was detained. Chen is a member of the underworld. During the meeting, Yu secretly passed several opium pills to Chen. Yu hurriedly left the detention center, which aroused suspicion among the guards. The guards searched Chen and found four opium pills in his palm. When asked where they came from, Chen was evasive. The guard knew that they were given by the visitor, so he reported it to the director for review of the family visitation register. It was found that the visitor was named Yu Zilian, and it was noted that he was a patrolman at a police station. The director reported the situation to Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin, stating that the police officer knowingly violated the law and was responsible for his own actions. He sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to first expel Yu Zilian, and then immediately send him to the District Court, where the prosecutor would interrogate him and order him to be detained pending trial.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Oppose Registration</h3>
<p>Drafting Five Reasons to Send to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Submitting to the Board of Directors for Deliberation to Cancel Registration</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the general representatives of the city's rickshaw pullers, Chen Guoliang, Qian Youfu, Xu Qingzi, Yao Shengtin, Lu Shaode, Wan Yuexing, Li Shaoqing, etc., representing 50,000 people, oppose the Municipal Council's new regulations requiring rickshaw pullers to register. They have repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Council to withdraw the order. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, the representatives petitioned the Municipal Council, requesting the cancellation of the registration requirement. Deputy Director Philip met with them. Rickshaw puller representative Chen Guoliang and others stated the difficult circumstances of rickshaw puller registration, which would inevitably lead to major disputes. Mr. Philip agreed to forward it to Director Zhong and submit it to the Board of Directors for discussion. It is now known that the association yesterday sent another letter to the Municipal Council, supplementing the reasons and requesting the cancellation of rickshaw puller registration and requesting submission to the Board of Directors for deliberation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Livelihood</h3>
<p>One, if rickshaw puller registration is implemented, stipulating that each rickshaw puller must register three or four people, divided into day and night shifts, to control rickshaw business, it is found that there are more than 80,000 rickshaw pullers in Shanghai, and more than half of them are of a transitional nature to make a living. The three people are divided into A, B, and C. If A has another business and is absent, there are still B and C. If B is sick, there is still C. If one person C can pull both day and night shifts, and if C returns to Jiangbei, since there is a regulation that rickshaw pullers cannot pull a rickshaw without registration, this rickshaw can only be suspended, and the rickshaw donation will also be lost, damaging the interests of all three parties. This is one of the reasons why registration cannot be implemented.</p>
<h3>Unstable Travels</h3>
<p>Two, it is found that most rickshaw pullers are from Jiangbei. According to the old custom, they come in the spring and leave in the winter. If a rickshaw puller registers in the spring and then returns to Jiangbei to farm, there are also rickshaw pullers who come to Shanghai who do not farm and are wholeheartedly seeking to pull rickshaws. If they are not registered, they cannot pull a rickshaw, which not only affects their livelihood but also has travel expenses coming and no travel expenses going. Whether the rickshaw pullers harbor resentment against the new regulations is unknown. In the future, there will be rickshaws without pullers and people with rickshaws who cannot pull them. This is the second reason why registration cannot be implemented.</p>
<h3>Impact of Unemployment</h3>
<p>Three: Comparing the current rickshaw pullers in the Special District with those in the Chinese areas, and considering the satisfaction of both groups of rickshaw pullers, there are over 80,000 rickshaw pullers in the Special District. If a registration system is implemented, only 30,000 will qualify, leaving over 50,000 unemployed. Considering their families, wives, and children, this will affect the livelihoods of over 100,000 civilians, causing panic. When they resort to desperate measures, not only will the owners demand payment from the rickshaw pullers for outstanding debts, but the unregistered rickshaw pullers will fight with the registered ones, one wanting to pull the rickshaw and the other forbidding it. Both sides will inevitably fight to the death, which will affect the security of the concession. This is the third reason why registration cannot be implemented.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Design Issues</h3>
<p>Four: Regarding the issue of changing the rickshaw design, we rickshaw pullers do not know how much you will change the design. If the owners place the responsibility on us rickshaw pullers, it becomes the rickshaw puller's responsibility. In Shanghai, trams and automobiles are everywhere, so it is the rickshaw puller's responsibility. If a car drives too fast and crashes into a rickshaw and flees, if the rickshaw puller pulls the damaged vehicle to the company, the owner will definitely make the rickshaw puller responsible for compensation. If the rickshaw price is substantial, the rickshaw puller will also bear the responsibility for compensation in the future, and we will not bear any responsibility for compensation. If the new rickshaw design is not suitable for the rickshaw pullers...</p>
<h3>Relief for Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Five: The Rickshaw Pullers' Relief Association is controlled and organized by the committee. The various facilities and circumstances of the organization not only do not match the actual relief for rickshaw pullers but also waste public funds. If it is handled in this way, the principals will inevitably find an excuse to stop the subsidies, reversing all previous efforts. If the Mutual Aid Association for rickshaw pullers, funded by your esteemed Public Works Bureau, is handed over to the management of both labor and capital, so as to completely eliminate disputes, the goal can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Crime Log</h3>
<p>Chen Yaodong's Home: Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, four robbers, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, suddenly arrived at the home of Chen Dongyao, a Ningbo accountant at the Dacheng Rice Shop, No. 131 Zhuhang Lane, Nanshi. They pretended to be public officials and used the excuse of searching for red pills and drugs to enter the inner room. They drew out handguns, drove the Chen family to a corner, and forbade them from making a sound. They ransacked the boxes and chests, seizing over 160 silver dollars, two pairs of gold bracelets, one pearl flower, one gold watch chain, five gold rings, four gold lockets, one gold flower, three gold bells, one share of Nanyang Tobacco Company stock, and one diamond watch belonging to Gu Zhenhu, who lived with the Chen family, as well as other valuable ornaments (worth over 4,000 silver dollars). They took the loot, left the house, and scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>Han Changji's Home: Han Changji, a 33-year-old Shanghai native, living at No. 53 Wangjiazhai, Nanshi, was suddenly visited by five robbers yesterday morning around 10:00 AM. They showed handguns, forbade any noise, and seized two diamond rings and valuable clothing and ornaments belonging to the Han family. They took the loot, left the house, and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, Han immediately reported the situation to the Dongjiadu Police Station under its jurisdiction, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Xu Xiuzhi's Home: At the home of Xu Xiuzhi, residing at No. 28 Fuyouli, Danfeng Road, Xinwenhe, around 7:00 PM the night before, four robbers suddenly arrived, all speaking with a Ningbo accent. They drew out handguns and robbed over 330 silver dollars and over 100 small coins, then left swaggering away.</p>
<p>Yu Garden Road: The home of a certain surname at No. 28, Lane 66, Yuyuan Road, was suddenly broken into by five bandits yesterday morning around 8:30 AM. Only two of the bandits had handguns. They first guarded the people in the house and forbade them from making a sound. Then they forced them to hand over the keys to the chests, ransacked the boxes and chests, and looted at will. After about half an hour, they left fully laden. The homeowner urgently reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station under its jurisdiction after the incident, requesting a pursuit. The total loss is estimated at over 700 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Huishan Road: No. 7 Huishan Road was suddenly visited by two bandits around 3:00 AM yesterday morning. Only one of the bandits had a handgun. They opened the cash register and robbed over 300 silver dollars before fleeing. Afterwards, the shop owner reported to the Lanthe Bridge Police Station under its jurisdiction, requesting a pursuit.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuzhi Wounded by Companion with a Knife</h3>
<p>Cause of Injury Unknown</p>
<p>Wang Yuzhi, from Funing, living in Taiheli, Qiqihar Road, was suddenly visited by four or five men around 10:00 AM yesterday morning. After a brief conversation with Wang at his residence, they went out together. Unexpectedly, when they reached the wasteland near the boundary between the Chinese and French Concessions at the end of Qiqihar Road, the men suddenly drew out a sharp axe and hacked at Wang. Wang Yuzhi, unprepared, was hit by five axe blows, seriously wounded and fell to the ground, covered in blood, barely breathing. The murderers, seeing their goal had been achieved, scattered like crows and beasts. Fortunately, a passerby saw them and hurried to report to the Yinxianggang Branch Bureau. By the time the police arrived, the murderers had already fled without a trace. Wang was rushed to the hospital for treatment, and his condition is critical. The reason for the injury is unknown, but it is rumored that the case is related to Zhang Damaizi from Jiangbei.</p>
<h3>Fire on Hengtong Road, Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>An Elderly Woman Failed to Escape</p>
<p>A firewood shop at No. 247, west end of Hengtong Road, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, suddenly caught fire at 2:30 AM this morning. Thick smoke filled the air and burst through the roof, quickly spreading to the barbershop at No. 245, the pancake shop at No. 349, and the funerary shop at No. 341, as well as the houses opposite at No. 242 and No. 246. The fire brigade arrived on the scene after hearing the alarm and poured water to extinguish the fire. It was gradually extinguished at 3:30 AM. It is reported that there was an elderly woman inside No. 247 who failed to escape and is feared to have been burned to death.</p>
<h3>Zhu Rongzhuang Donates Paintings to Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Zhu Rongzhuang of Yixing is skilled in painting. He has lived in Shanghai for over ten years and has served as a lecturer in the Sea Cang Sheng Ming Zhi University, Shanghai Art College, and Chinese Art College. His son, Mingxin, follows the style of Xinluo and is especially skilled in calligraphy, and once had the reputation of being a child prodigy. His daughter, Mingqing, paints landscapes that closely resemble the style of the Four Wangs, with a unique and elegant touch. The family is refined and does not seek fame. Seeing the severe drought in their hometown, with rural areas bankrupt, they specially arranged for a hundred tons of paintings created over the years, and a hundred pairs of couplets written by Mingxin, all finely bound, to be publicly exhibited, with all proceeds going to disaster relief. Due to the temporary lack of a suitable location, they urgently asked Madame Jialing Luo Tai, who generously lent her new house opposite the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road for use, to fulfill their ambitions. This is truly admirable. It is scheduled to open on the 21st of this month. The exhibition will feature ink paintings by Mr. Ji Juemi, adding much to the event's appeal. His calligraphy has a unique style, majestic and ancient, directly following the Qin and Han dynasties. He can write large characters of one zhang and eight chi in length using the thirteen-section linked-pearl brush outside of the 嶁蝌蚪 style. His playful works, such as writing with eyes closed, with left and right hands, from the back, and with three brushes simultaneously, are all worth seeing. Mr. Ji's calligraphy is mainly for his own enjoyment and initially did not intend to exhibit. However, after Mr. Zhu's repeated urging, he reluctantly agreed to the request. It is also said that Mr. Zhu also generously offered to sell his collection of Shigu's copy of Tang Xieyuan's Mountain Residence Conversation Map to aid in disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Famous Painter Qi Jingxi from Beiping Hosted Guests Yesterday</h3>
<p>Qi Jingxi, a famous painter from Beiping, made a special trip south at the invitation of friends in Shanghai, and is taking a short rest in Shanghai. He plans to tour famous scenic spots in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. He brought more than 20 of his best works, and at the invitation of the owner of Rongbaozhai, they are displayed at the Lake Society. Viewers praised them endlessly. Last night, Qi's close friend Zhu Xinpei invited friends from the calligraphy and painting circles and the press in Shanghai, such as Ma Qizhou, Zheng Wuchang, Yan Esheng, Ke Ding'an, Xiong Songquan, Xie Yucen, Luo Liqin, Bao Shuxian, Liu Hanfeng, Bei Huanlong, Zhu Boyuan, and Xu Qiwen, to a banquet at the Taolechun Restaurant on Edward Road, which was a grand occasion. It is heard that Mr. Qi is currently residing in Rongbaozhai on Henan Road. Anyone wishing to obtain Mr. Qi's paintings can go directly to him.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Bicycle Repair Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Since receiving approval from the Municipal Party Headquarters for its preparation, the Bicycle Repair Industry Workers' Union has made unremitting efforts. More than 180 workers have joined. Therefore, at 10:00 AM on the 18th, a founding meeting was held in the auditorium of the Qingji Elementary School on Guling Road. More than 120 members attended. The Municipal Party Headquarters specially sent Comrade Fan Guoren and the General Labor Union specially sent Comrade Fang Rusheng to attend and provide guidance. Representatives of the two industry associations for selling, manufacturing, and renting bicycles, Wang Disheng and Li Fengting, also attended. Zhang Yingmei, an inspector from the General Patrol Room, was specially sent to oversee the scene. Hou Shuigen, Chen Xiaobao, and Hu Genbao were publicly elected as the presidium. After the ceremony, Hou Shuigen first reported the significance of the meeting, followed by speeches from representatives of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union. Subsequently, the regulations were approved, and many proposals were discussed. Finally, Hou Shuigen, Zhang Xingcai, Han Dafu, Chen Xiaobao, and Zhu Ayou were elected as official directors, Hu Genbao and Chen Agou were elected as alternate directors, and Su Maotou, Zhu Bingzhang, and Shi Asong were elected as supervisors, with Wu Peixi as an alternate supervisor.</p>
<h3>Plain People's Sanatorium Adds a Tuberculosis Department</h3>
<p>The Plain People's Sanatorium at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road, with its magnificent architecture and large scale, is a famous plain people's sanatorium in the city. Director Wang Peiyuan enjoys a high reputation in the medical field, and Director Yang Zhongfu is also a renowned figure in the medical community. Therefore, the sanatorium's affairs are becoming increasingly developed, with a great potential for future success. The sanatorium pays close attention to the health of plain people, and strives to provide relief to poor patients. Furthermore, Director Yang spares no effort in the administrative construction of the sanatorium. It is said that various internal facilities are modeled after those in Europe and America. Moreover, the sanatorium is located in a quiet area, surrounded by forests, and the air in the wards is fresh, making it very suitable for the treatment of lung diseases. Director Yang, aware that there are many patients with lung diseases, recently added a tuberculosis department. In addition to hiring a specialist doctor to reside in the sanatorium, he also opened various rooms on the fourth floor as specialized tuberculosis treatment rooms. Patients who come to the sanatorium for examination do not incur any fees, which shows the general welfare provided by the sanatorium.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Store's 7th Anniversary Grand Sale with Unprecedented Sacrifice</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Store in this city, famous for specializing in authentic Sichuan tremella and ginseng, has always been praised by people in and outside the city for its genuine goods and fair prices, and its business is very prosperous. Recently, the tremella mountain farm owned by the store in Sichuan had a more abundant harvest this year. A large quantity of newly produced tremella has now arrived, and a large amount of ginseng and bird's nest have been purchased in various places. Coinciding with the 7th anniversary, a special grand sale will be held simultaneously at the Nanjing Road (intersection of Shanxi Road) headquarters and the Bowling Alley branch (i.e., the old store) for three weeks from November 20th, to thank all sectors for their patronage over the years. In addition to improving the quality of tremella, ginseng, and bird's nest and offering discounts, there will also be unprecedented sacrifices, such as old tremella, which was originally priced at five yuan last year, now selling for two yuan, and those originally priced at two yuan last year, now selling for one yuan. The store rarely reduces prices, and this time the sacrifice of each item is the cheapest ever seen in this city, which is a good opportunity for many people to replenish their health. There is sure to be a lot of excitement on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>City Sounds</p>
<p>Peide Company Winter Sale: Peide Necktie Company, No. 355 Sichuan Road in this city, is the most comprehensive necktie company. Its famous products, various neckties, are completely different from those sold on the market. This is because Peide Neckties employs specialized technicians who carefully manufacture them with modern styles and a wide range of colors. They have been sold throughout the country for more than ten years and are highly praised by users. The company believes that Peide Neckties are most suitable as gifts as the winter solstice approaches. A winter sale has now been held for twenty-five days starting yesterday, with hundreds of types of the latest winter neckties and imported neckties, woolen goods, leather shoes, gloves, and all kinds of Western clothing items, discounted from 30% to 70%. Westerners who want to buy cheap goods should not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Blue Emden Popular Throughout the Country: Emden cigarettes, a famous product of Jiangzhe Tobacco Company, have long been known throughout the country for their excellent tobacco and high-quality materials. Recently, the company has also launched a new type of ten-pack Blue Emden cigarette, and the taste is even better. Since its release, it has been unanimously welcomed by society, and its sales have broken all records. There are also valuable gifts inside the package, with every package promising a prize. The total amount of gifts reaches tens of thousands of yuan, which is different from the common practice of only giving away matches. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Chapter on the Central Government in the Draft Constitution (Continued)</h3>
<p>Speaker: Legislator Tao Lüqian</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai, Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA</p>
<p>Time: November 17th, 7:30 PM -</p>
<p>Third point: According to the current system, above the Five Yuans, there is the organization of the National Government, and there is also the Central Political Council between the party and the government, which is the source of all political actions. Therefore, the Five Yuans are nominally the highest authorities, but in fact, important matters must be requested from the Political Council. The National Government has almost become a transfer mechanism between the Government Council and the Five Yuans. Although there are regulations for the National Government Committee Meeting in the National Government Organization Law, its powers do not belong to it, and its meaning has long been lost. This system was originally a method for trial implementation during the period of political tutelage. If the Constitution is promulgated and constitutional government is achieved, then the central political power belongs to the National Assembly (Article 24 of the Founding Program, the power of governance belongs to the Five Yuans, and the boundary between political power and the power of governance has been clearly defined, so the Political Council can naturally be abolished. The Five Yuans each have their own responsibilities, and their powers and responsibilities are clear. Separately, they are individual independent agencies; combined, they constitute the central government (Premier's speech on the Five-Power Constitution, third diagram). Therefore, there is no need to form a concrete National Government outside the Five Yuans to surpass the Five Yuans. Some argue that the independence of the Five Yuans in exercising their powers is questionable, and advocate that the President should supervise the Five Yuans and bring them to fruition, or establish a State Council as a means of integrating and coordinating the Five Yuans. Otherwise, the extreme division of the five powers will inevitably lead to isolation and dispersion, making it difficult to form a strong central hub. Lüqian dares not say that this kind of concern is without considerable reason. My colleagues in the Legislative Yuan have also paid attention to this. However, if the above two methods are adopted, the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution will be fundamentally eliminated, and the Five-Power Constitution can be rejected. Although the President is the head of state, the powers of the head of state are limited, as listed in Articles 36 to 43 of this chapter. As for the executive power that he also holds, it is specifically granted by the Constitution and is not inherently possessed by the head of state himself. Therefore, the Premier's speech on the Five-Power Constitution only stated that "in terms of executive personnel," another president should be established to execute administrative affairs, and did not say that the Five Yuans should be supervised and brought to fruition by the President. If the draft constitution stipulates that the President has the power of the Yuan, the result will inevitably be that the five powers become one power, the consequences of which are unimaginable. Even in countries with the three-power system, there is no such method. If you want to use the State Council to integrate the affairs related to each Yuan and coordinate the feelings between the Yuans in order to reduce disputes, the intention is good, but after the Constitution is promulgated, we should hope that each agency can abide by the law, and should not hope to destroy the trajectory of the rule of law through coordination and emotional effects. If each agency can abide by the law, then the powers and responsibilities are fixed, and each is responsible, and there seems to be no need for integration. If A infringes on B's power, then the infringer is certainly violating the law, and the infringed is also neglecting his duty, and there is no coordination to be discussed. Moreover, the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan are both committee systems and collective deliberation systems. The entire Yuan is responsible to the National Assembly, which is different from the Judicial and Examination Yuans, which are responsible by the Presidents. Even if there is an organization of the State Council, the presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans cannot represent the entire body, and there will still be many obstacles in reality. Therefore, my colleagues in the Legislative Yuan believe that the above two methods cannot be adopted. However, the central government has five Yuans, just like the human body has five senses. Although each has its own functions and responsibilities, they are not isolated from each other and indifferent to each other's pain. We always want to find a way to connect and integrate under the principle of separation of five powers. At the same time, we feel that among the five Yuans, the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans have more relations with the other three Yuans and are most prone to misunderstandings. Therefore, in Articles 65 and 93, it is stipulated that the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan may raise questions to the Yuans, ministries, and committees. This kind of questioning has no vote of no confidence as a backing, and its nature is completely different from the questioning power of the parliament. However, it is intended to clarify and eliminate misunderstandings. Moreover, the Legislative Yuan may raise questions to the Executive, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory branches; the Supervisory Yuan may also raise questions to the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, and Examination branches; it is not specifically set up for the executive branch. For example, if the Legislative Yuan passes a bill, the President has already announced it, but the competent authority has not yet implemented it, in this case, the Legislative Yuan can of course raise questions, and the competent authority should answer in detail the reasons for delaying implementation. Also, if the Supervisory Yuan learns that a certain civil servant is suspected of violating the law and engaging in corruption, but is not very clear about the truth, it can ask a certain agency before filing an impeachment. The agency shall be obliged to provide a true answer. The Supervisory Yuan will then decide whether to file the impeachment based on its response. With this kind of communication method, not only can countless disputes be reduced invisibly, but also there will be no drawbacks of each acting independently and not consulting each other. Moreover, according to Article 37, the President shall promulgate laws and issue orders in accordance with the law, and must be countersigned by the president of the relevant branch. This article is sufficient to show the affiliation between the President and each Yuan and contains two meanings. On the President's side, he can promulgate laws and issue orders, but there are conditions attached, namely (1) he must do so in accordance with the law, and (2) he must be countersigned by the president of the relevant Yuan. On the side of the Five Yuans, all matters that have been resolved by this Yuan, if they are laws, should be sent to the President for promulgation; if they are orders to be issued in the name of the President (such as pardons, declarations of war, appointments and removals of officials), they should be sent to the President for legal processing. Therefore, although the President only manages the administration, he has not been barred from hearing important matters of the other four Yuans, but he cannot interfere. The so-called "separately, they are individual independent agencies; combined, they constitute the central government" is the meaning of this. As for the fear that there will be conflicts between the Yuans that cannot be resolved, legal solutions and sanctions by the National Assembly are sufficient to solve the problem, so there is no need to worry too much.</p>
<p>Fourth point: According to the Premier's teachings, after the Constitution is formulated, the people elect the President to organize the Executive Yuan, and elect the parliamentarians to organize the Legislative Yuan. The presidents of the remaining three Yuans are appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. Now, the draft constitution stipulates that the President freely appoints and dismisses the President of the Executive Yuan, the Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans are elected by the National Assembly, and the Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans are appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. This is slightly different from the methods set by the Premier, but there is no conflict in spirit. Because the power of supervision originally belongs to the legislative body, in order to prevent the legislative body from borrowing the power of impeachment to control the executive body, the Premier divided the power of supervision from half of the legislative body. Since the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans have the same source, the method of producing the presidents of the two Yuans may also be the same. Moreover, the Supervisory Yuan is responsible for investigating cases and can not only impeach general civil servants, but also impeach the President. If the President proposes the candidates for the President of the Supervisory Yuan, the President's side is usually prone to the suspicion of manipulating the Supervisory Yuan, and in the event that the President is impeached, the position of the President of the Supervisory Yuan will inevitably feel difficult. Based on the above reasons, we decided that the President of the Supervisory Yuan should also be elected by the National Assembly, strictly maintaining the spirit of independence of the power of supervision.

Over the New Year, he discovered the central route of the Han Dynasty to the Western Regions and the campsite for the Western Expedition against the Xiongnu. Now that Mr. Huang's investigation has been successful, he has returned to Beiping and took a train to Beijing on the 17th to report his trip to Xinjiang to the Ministry of Education. The reporter interviewed Mr. Huang before his departure, and he graciously agreed to be interviewed. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>I departed in early October of last spring, following the New Sui Highway Survey Team of the Ministry of Railways, via the Mongolian grasslands, heading to Xinjiang. It took slightly less time to pass through the grasslands. When we reached the Ejina River, we discovered a huge Han Dynasty [ancient site] east of Heicheng, with the ruins of more than eighty camps, covering an area of about forty square li. It should have been the location where soldiers were stationed during the Han Dynasty's campaign against the Xiongnu. About one to two hundred li nearby the ancient site, there are villages that retain pottery, all complete jars and tiles. The ancient site is likely the ruins of the Western Han Dynasty. The "Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty's Western Conquest" mentions the capture of cities near the Black Water, which must be this site. After staying here for about two months, we proceeded further, reaching Hami in early February this year. Due to the unrest, the route to Dihua was blocked, so we went to Yanqi, hired camels and went to Lop Nur. The results of the investigation were quite good. In the ancient site I discovered in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic (Huang went to Xinjiang once in the 19th year of the Republic), I found remnants of the "Analects" written during the Western Han Dynasty, and records of the Juju Granary, which are quite precious. The wooden slips are inscribed with "Yu Yi Yu Wu Jia Zhu Ren Zi Yue Ci Fei [余亦欲毋加諸人子曰賜非]," which differs from the current "Analects." The character "Ye [也]" is missing after "Ci [賜]." As for the records of the Juju Granary, it reads "Ju Lu Zi Cang Zheng You Xing [居廬貲倉征郵行]," but the "Wei Lue [魏略]" does not contain the character "Zi [貲]." It is thought that it was deleted by the person who wrote the "Wei Lue," and "Ju Lu Zi [居廬貲]" is a Xiongnu word. We also discovered an ancient road nearby, about five li from the beacon tower I discovered, running east-west, which is indeed the central route to the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty as recorded in the "Wei Lue." Along the road, we picked up more than eight hundred Five-Shu coins, bronze arrowheads, and other items. We also explored ancient villages, houses, ditches, ancient tombs, etc. along the Kongque River. Later, due to the hot weather and the death of many camels and horses, and the depletion of the food we brought, we turned to Dihua. When we investigated education, the new unrest had just subsided, and we were warmly welcomed, and guided to visit various schools. Due to economic difficulties, the schools lacked educational supplies, textbooks, and books. Currently, Xinjiang has one Russian political science school, one middle school, and one primary school. Many primary school students are enrolled. There are two girls' schools, one provincial and one county. The provincial one is run by Madame Sheng Shicai and has better results. The ethnic groups' demand for knowledge is also strong. As for my archaeological findings, they are all transported by the New Sui automobiles, but they have not yet been shipped to Ping. Among them are issues related to the topographical changes of Lop Nur. Lop Nur has a tendency to move north because the Kongque River has changed its course. On this trip to Nanjing, I will make a detailed report of this trip to the government and the people of the country. Recently, I have been entrusted by the people of Xinjiang to ask cultural traders to provide substantial assistance to education and culture, and to communicate the goodwill of various ethnic groups. I believe that the government will not disappoint the border people. This time, I returned to Ping by the New Sui automobile. The automobile route is slightly different from the route I took when I went. If they can be mutually referenced, a perfect New Sui route can be formed. I can say that I have successfully explored the archaeological route to Xinjiang on this trip, so I am very pleased. (Jin)</p>

Adjacent to this magnificent park, in the public sports field, fifty-nine elementary schools from the Jiangxi provincial capital, with fourteen to fifteen thousand innocent and lively children, are holding the first joint elementary school sports meet in the Jiangxi provincial capital.</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, Chairman Chiang, returning from an inspection of the Northwest, arrived gracefully. The military band played loudly as Chairman Xiong and Director of Education Cheng welcomed him onto the platform. Chiang expressed his great joy upon seeing the neat and energetic rows of elementary school students. The solemn, serious, and grand event officially opened amidst the stirring military music and the sounds of saluting cannons. President Cheng Shikui delivered the opening address.</p>
<p>Chiang's Instructions</p>
<p>Next, Chairman Chiang gave instructions. Chiang asked loudly from the platform, "Can those in the back hear me?" He then ordered the people on the left and right to close ranks and move ten steps forward, forming a dense formation. The movements were quite swift. After the formation was complete, Chiang saluted the whole assembly and spoke from the temporary oath-taking platform. The gist of his speech was as follows: "Today is the first joint elementary school sports meet in the Jiangxi provincial capital. Elementary school sports are the foundation of all sports. A good foundation leads to a model for all sports. Therefore, every athlete should aim to be a foundation and a model for the nation. The most important thing in sports is for each person to abide by discipline, follow order, and obey commands. Doing so aligns with the principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. The most pressing need for us now is to cultivate national morality. The basic conditions for morality are understanding propriety, knowing shame, and abiding by discipline. Therefore, do not lose morality and propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame in sports. To do so would be a great disgrace. The revival of the nation is centered on Jiangxi, making it a model. All of you elementary school students are the foundation of the people of Jiangxi. I, the Chairman, hope that you will bear this intent and mission in mind, cultivate yourselves into moral and exemplary citizens, become models for the nation, and revive China." After Chiang's speech, he returned to his camp. Governor Xiong Shihui and Central Committee Member Ding Chaowu then gave brief instructions, all explaining propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, emphasizing strengthening the race and wiping out humiliation, aiming to teach a sense of shame and prepare for war. After the instructions, all the athletes raised their right hands together, and Xiao Dequan delivered the oath. Then, the entire assembly paraded around the field three times, completing the ceremony, and the athletic competitions began.</p>
<p>Day One</p>
<p>The first joint elementary school sports meet in Jiangxi opened on the 14th. Chairman Chiang personally attended to give instructions. After the opening ceremony, various schools performed drills (44 schools in total), performing six sections of freehand exercises. Their neatness and speed showcased their liveliness and innocence. After the performance, the entire assembly paraded around the field once, and the competitions began. The results for the first day are as follows:</p>
<p>Field Events: In the boys' Group C long jump, Xiong Gonghua of Shunwai Elementary School achieved 17.57 meters. In the girls' Group B high jump, Hui Juan of Beitan achieved 1.12 meters. In the girls' Group C long jump, Hui Rong of Zhuangyuanqiao achieved 3.36 meters. All broke the city records. In the boys' Group A and B iron javelin throw, Deng Yangui of Tianhou reached 17.57 meters. In the boys' Group D shot put, Wang Bengen of Buting reached 6.97 meters. In the girls' Group A high jump, Cheng Rairong of Tianhou Palace reached 1.12 meters. In the girls' Group C javelin, Wang Zaixiang of Jingtang reached 22.25 meters. Due to the large number of participants, the track races did not have finals.</p>
<p>Performances: All the participating schools had group performances. The performers today included Xu Gongmeng and others from the No. 2 Normal School Primary School, who performed the Liuhequan and sword dance. Chang Chunsheng performed arrow steps and double knives. Li Fushen performed Yue's Eight Styles. Huiminmen Elementary School performed the Four Joys Fist as a group. The elementary school students' performances of double knives and sword dance were both agile and energetic. However, one matter must be specially reported today: After Chiang visited the sports meet and returned to Beitan, he saw that the park and the sports field were surrounded by overgrown weeds reaching the knees, which was very desolate. He instructed Chairman Xiong and the two municipal directors to clean it up within twelve hours and ordered them to pay attention to the neatness and cleanliness of the entire city.</p>
<p>Day Two</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The 15th was the second day of the Jiangxi Provincial Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. Because the weather was sunny and the Lakeside Park, which leaned against the sports field, was filled with chrysanthemums like brocade and clouds, the audience was still very enthusiastic. Around the venue, the open space was covered with Boy Scout camps, like an army gathered in a barracks. Children singing wildly and laughing innocently were swarming all over the yellow grass. Those who were competing back and forth in the field were all nimble and active youngsters. The disciplinary team of the conference was made up of strong men in uniform, one guard every five steps, and one sentry every ten steps, so the order was better than yesterday. From nine AM to twelve noon and from one PM to five PM, there were thirteen finals for both boys and girls, many breaking city records. There were more than twenty preliminary and semi-final events. More than ten schools did group performances. In the midst of the intense track and field competition, eight airplanes flew, like swallows and shuttles, floating and diving, circling and dancing in the air above the conference. The venue cheered and jumped continuously. The results for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Field Events: 1. Long Jump: In the boys' Group A, Zhang Ji of the Nanshi Affiliated Elementary School reached 4.86 meters, breaking the city record. In Group B, Yang Zuojie of Niuxing reached 4.38 meters, breaking the city record. In Group D, Liu Kexin of Guangxiao reached 3.70 meters. 2. Softball: In the boys' Group A, Fan Xuxi of Louji Cemetery reached 40.24 meters. In Group C, Fu Yiru of Faxiao reached 3.876 meters. In the girls' Group A, Liu Yu of Louxiao reached 22.85 meters. In Group B, Liu Juan of Beitan reached 16.51 meters. 3. Shot Put: In the boys' Group B, Shen Qinfa of Puxiao reached 7.71 meters. In the girls' Group A, Cheng Rairong of Tianhou Palace reached 6.45 meters, breaking the city record. 4. In the boys' Group A 200-meter relay, Nanshi Affiliated Elementary School reached 28.2 seconds.</p>
<p>Performances: A total of 40 people from Nanshi Affiliated Elementary School performed martial arts, 30 people from Baoling Affiliated Elementary School performed group games, 80 people performed flexibility exercises, Zhengmeng kicked Jianzi, 35 people from Erlang Temple Elementary School performed martial arts, and Buddhist People's Elementary School performed songs and dances. Among them, Erlang Temple's solo performance was the most exciting. Their various games and group exercises were also quite remarkable, and the enthusiasm of the participants shows that sports are becoming more and more popular.</p>
<h3>Results of the General Practice for the Race Walk</h3>
<p>The fourth open race walk competition will be held on the 25th of this month. The last practice was held yesterday. More than fifty people participated. The Chinese Race Walking Association specially prepared a car to send staff to follow, observe, and take care of the participants. The results were quite good. However, one or two people had a fast pace, but their knees were not straight, and their steps were jumping, which violated the rules. It is hoped that they will pay attention to this. The enthusiastic Westerner A. Jek also accompanied the race walkers and prepared milk and snacks in Shen Garden to comfort the cold participants and offer a little consolation. The weather was not good this morning, with heavy rain at times, so the results were inevitably slightly worse. More than thirty people completed the entire course. The names and times of the top fifteen are as follows: 1. Zheng Chengshan, 1 hour, 50 minutes, 25 seconds; 2. Fan Jiahong, 1 hour, 56 minutes, 15 seconds; 2. Qian Qiming, same time; 2. Ge Zhigao, same time; 5. Zhang Xianfeng, 2 hours, 1 minute, 40 seconds; 6. Tan Rongsheng, 2 hours, 3 minutes, 25 seconds; 7. Zhi Xiongde, 2 hours, 5 minutes; 7. Yang Derun, same time; 9. Shi Liangyan, 2 hours, 7 minutes; 10. Tang Wanyi, 2 hours, 7 minutes, 30 seconds; 11. Wang Baoquan, 2 hours, 7 minutes, 32 seconds; 12. Chen Chungeng, 2 hours, 9 minutes; 13. Duanmule Qin, 2 hours, 9 minutes, 50 seconds; 14. Mo Shilong, 2 hours, 10 minutes; 16. Zhou Yinhua, 2 hours, 11 minutes.</p>

The Guangzhao team has a strong lineup, but the ABC team was not to be outdone. It happened to be raining, and the fierce battle was unusual. They braved the rain and wind, covered in mud. Both sides were like drowned chickens. In the end, ABC won 3-2. The scores were 21-10, 21-19, 17-21, and 21-19.</p>

<h3>Humanity's Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>The tragedy of humanity lies here! We don't believe in God, but we want to create an idol of God for ourselves to worship. But when this idol of God is about to be completed, our own faith wavers again, and we destroy this idol with our own hands, and create another idol of God. But the fate of this idol is still the same as before, being destroyed by our own hands halfway through. The Hebrews said that God created man in His own image. In fact, it is man who creates God, in man's own image. The problem lies here. Because man creates God according to his own image, giving God form, but not giving Him an inner life - a power to constantly adapt to the environment. So when humanity's external environment, in the process of daily change, undergoes a transformation, humanity will soon adapt to that new environment, but the idol of God has no such ability, and man has no choice but to destroy this old idol and create a new one.</p>
<p>In Greece, there is the myth of Zeus usurping his father Cronos. In Christianity, there is also the news that when Jesus was born, someone in the wilderness heard the announcement of the death of Pan (who is considered by Christians to be the representative of all heresy). This is the new idol destroying the old idol. However, the idol itself cannot arise or perish on its own, because the idol is fundamentally a non-existent void in the objective world. In other words, it simply doesn't exist. Even if it does, it is only a concept in the human mind. Humanity has visualized its concept and turned it into God. Therefore, God is merely a trick played by the human mind, to comfort its objective defects.</p>
<p>In short, it is humanity that creates God, not God that creates humanity. Some may say that in any society, we only see priests kneeling under the throne of God, preaching for God, and serving God, seemingly slaves of God, and only listening to God's commands. In fact, it is God who obeys the priests. The priests are the masters, and God is the slave. They use God's teachings to achieve their own purposes. (If God were conscious, He would surely be furious and strike dead His priests first.) In primitive society, priests became a special class, dominating others. Even the warriors wielding weapons were subject to their control. Later, as society evolved slightly, although the warrior class replaced the priests in exercising political power, the priestly class, although they lost some of their power, on the other hand, received special treatment from the warriors, because the warrior class also knew that these priests serving God were useful in some ways. So, up to the present, in barbarian societies, as well as those calling themselves civilized societies, warriors and priests still hold political power together. God naturally has His special uses for the priests, and those who extremely support idols are naturally this group of priests. As for whether they truly believe, that is another question. However, if someone raises a hand to try to topple that idol, then they will stand up in defense, posing as defenders of the true faith. Take Christianity as an example. First, the Romans rose up to massacre Christians. Later, the Christians themselves crucified those they called heretics or burned them at the stake. Then, they fought among themselves, Catholics killing Protestants, Protestants killing Catholics, slaughtering each other for a century. The old idol was certainly changed, and a new idol was brought out, and everyone ceased fighting. In fact, behind both sides were warriors and priests conspiring, all using idols to achieve their desired goals. Stripped bare, it is all the same.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century today, under the scientific prism, there may be no need for idols of God. Yet, there are still those who dream of being priests, even though some have already raised their hands. In sociology, this is called the legacy of barbarism.</p>
<h3>About [Vernacular Couplets from Wuxia] and its Author, Mr. Wang Beizhuang</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xingu</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Chen Zizhan's article [Revisiting Vernacular Couplets from Wuxia], I couldn't help but think of [our predecessors] - our esteemed local elder, Mr. Wang Beizhuang. Mr. Wang lived in Yangjiazhuang, Guanting Tangzhen in our county. According to Mr. Chen's conjecture, he [used plain stationery to inscribe a couplet for the gate: 'All under heaven, all lands mourn; the restoration of China, all look up and praise.' At the end of the couplet, he signed himself 'Wang Youguang, Plain Historian of Qingpu.' He was probably a Hanlin scholar who benefited from the Qing Dynasty and was naturally moved to tears… What official position did Mr. Wang hold? I think it can be found in the Qingpu County Gazetteer…" But, unexpectedly, Mr. Wang was originally a scholar. The Qingpu County Gazetteer, in its "Biographies of Literary Figures" section, states:</p>
<p>Wang Youguang, courtesy name Guanguo, was a scholar. He studied with Tang Bi, Dai Junpang, and Xue Dingming. He was intelligent, well-versed in the classics and history, and could use ancient affairs to address current issues. People from all directions came to him with doubts and questions every day. His most outstanding disciples were Huang Jinzhong, Lu Qizhao, Cheng Can, Xu Yuan, and Dong Yongbin, all of whom gained fame in the imperial academy. He lived in Beiyang Village! The villa of Yang Weizhen! He had hundreds of plum trees, under which he would chant and meditate, clarifying his mind and thinking lightly. People called him Mr. Beizhuang…"</p>
<p>However, besides the published book [Vernacular Couplets from Wuxia], Mr. Beizhuang had many unpublished works, such as [Plain History], [Record of Hundred Things], [Beizhuang's Pure Talks], etc. Now, only the titles of these books remain.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Gu Diqin from my village, [Mr. Bu Xiang, whose name was Zhixun, was the great-grandson of Mr. Beizhuang! He once mentioned before his death that after the Taiping Rebellion, all of Mr. Beizhuang's writings were scattered and lost. What a pity!]"</p>
<p>Mr. Beizhuang was originally a poor scholar, making a living by teaching at schools. He had no surplus funds to publish books. The reason why [Vernacular Couplets from Wuxia] was able to exist was thanks to the efforts of his disciple Lu Qizhao, who donated money for its publication. Currently, the printing blocks for the book are still kept by Mr. Wang's descendants.</p>
<p>Anecdotes about Mr. Beizhuang are still talked about as interesting stories to this day. There is a local saying in my village: ["Defecating without wiping (pronounced as 'shu' in the departing tone) the buttocks, that's a person from Yangjiazhuang."] This refers to Mr. Beizhuang's situation at the time. While he was writing [Vernacular Couplets from Wuxia], he was so engrossed that he would forget to eat and sleep. Once, he happened to be in the toilet when he suddenly thought of a couplet. He hurriedly grabbed paper and pen to write it down, forgetting that he hadn't wiped his buttocks after defecating. From this, we can imagine that Mr. Beizhuang wrote the book [Vernacular Couplets from Wuxia] with [sincerity and perseverance].</p>
<h3>比蘭台羅的戲劇</h3>
<p>— 林煥平</p>
<p>This year's Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to the famous Italian playwright and novelist Luigi Pirandello. He has the nickname "the Maupassant of Italy." This isn't because he adopted Maupassant's literary methods, but because, like Maupassant, he was a prolific and excellent short story (conte) writer.</p>
<p>If Pirandello had remained solely a novelist, he probably would have been just a domestic writer, without the chance for such a glorious crown. Around the age of fifty (1917), he suddenly turned to drama, and his plays became the most remarkable presence in various countries after the war. His name then began to be recognized by the world. His debut play was "Right You Are (If You Think So)," and the 1921 play "Six Characters in Search of an Author" (translated into Chinese by Xu Xiacun, published by Water Foam) propelled him to the center of European playwrights. The first to introduce this book was Reinhardt, but the more authentic performance was the following year at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. Due to the great impact of this play, almost all avant-garde dramatists in Paris shook hands with him, leading to the emergence of the "Pirandello Era" in 1925. This signified the simultaneous performance of five of his plays, especially the overwhelming success of the masterpiece "Henry IV."</p>
<p>No country appreciates and cherishes him as much as France. His most active stage is in France; he also has the most literary friends in France. The two who most deeply influenced modern French literature are Dostoevsky and him. The talented critic Panchacriemieux is his translator, which may also be a reason. The literary sentiments of the time, leaning towards Proust (1871-1922), Valéry (Paul Ambroise Valéry, 1871), or Freudianism, undoubtedly created a suitable foundation for welcoming him. The so-called Pirandellism, on the one hand, refers to his literary method of understanding, and on the other hand, it refers to his dramaturgy as a theatrical problem. Pirandellism in playwriting has already shown its posture in popular drama, having a strong influence. This is the same reason that Cubism entered the music stage. This also serves as a side proof of how robust and fresh his playwriting technique is. In this sense of Pirandellism, I would like to conduct some examination.</p>
<p>Pirandello's theater, like Ibsen's and Shaw's, belongs to the category of thought plays, but his interest is entirely non-social, with significant differences in the problems of consciousness and cognition. He calls himself a philosophical writer, contrasting with "a historical writer" (Kriemieux's preface to "Henry IV"). His entire work can be said to bring the problem of "form" to a philosophical conclusion.</p>
<p>Six characters looking for an author to complete them, Henry IV recovers quickly from feigned madness and hopes to become Henry IV again. "Nakedness and Clothes," "Form and Life," "Ideal and Reality," "Madness and Sanity," "Consciousness and Cognition," his themes all seek them from the tangled relationships of these. In this sense, it is appropriate to call him a philosopher, but attention should be paid to the "human" attitude he reveals. Within him lies the conflict between "form" and "substance."</p>
<p>Pirandellism in playwriting, of course, cannot be separated from these ideological characteristics. Among all modern playwrights, there are probably none who are as concerned as he is with the possibilities of the stage or the effects of theatrical movement. He is a so-called anti-literary writer, valuing action and emphasizing stage design, which is where the modernist in theater stands. The qualities of the script of his plays are very strong. There is a continuity of suspense, chromatic presentation, making people feel detective novels and melodrama-like sensationalism. In addition, he knows the function of the theater well, strongly considering the audience's participation in the performance, and often expanding from the stage to the audience. Major changes are its usual practice, with characters mingling with the audience seats. In "Six Characters," without the mediation of background and costume, the audience directly meets the bare stage and the individual actors. Such a thorough abolition of the fourth wall is truly unprecedented. In "Henry IV," the actors themselves completely destroy and scatter the stage props during the performance. The audience is foolish in the audience seats, and cannot help but doubt even inside the theater.</p>
<p>But Pirandellism is not simply confined to stage tricks. It is the direct combination of the relationships between "stage and audience," "performance and reality," "actors and characters," "props and real objects," and so on, with his philosophical product of "form" and "substance." It is especially noteworthy that he surprisingly drives the function of the stage, which can achieve the purpose of drama while achieving the purpose of philosophy. Props, curtains, and costumes each become objects of philosophy for him. It is in this way of thinking about theater that his playwriting arises. An example of such a direct combination of intention and playwriting technique can be said to be completely non-existent. An example of philosophy being embodied in theater is also rare. In short, it is because the stage receives completely different treatment from the past, creating bewilderment, that he is called the "Sicilian Magician." But the modern spirit of theater will definitely not regard him as a heretic. He can be said to be the writer who most uprightly represents the major trends in postwar drama.

<h3>箱子蓋上</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<h3>On the Box Lid</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Having come to such a small town to live the life of a schoolteacher for more than half a month, the time for writing on weekdays has also ended. During breaks between classes, I want to steal some time to read, but there is no quiet place. But not turning a page of a book all day long feels like the days are hard to get through.</p>
<p>At night, I often stay alone in the school. The room is along the river, very quiet. There are often many boats selling things docked by the river beach. On nights with bright moons, listening to the boatmen chatting idly and humming sad tunes on the moonlit river, in this quiet dusk, I think I should do some night work!</p>
<p>However, there is no table in the room, and the few books I brought take up half a chair. There is no place to read or write, but I have come up with a very large table. Let's make use of the broken leather suitcase I brought with me! Put it on a wide stool, and the lid of the box is so flat, much wider than the surface of the chair.</p>
<p>So the box lid is my desk!</p>
<p>At dusk, I light a kerosene lamp, put a rinsing cup upside down to make a lamp holder, add a reflective paper lampshade, and then light a cigarette butt. I silently prostrate myself at this box lid desk to do my night work.</p>
<p>Every night, I prostrate myself on the box lid again with a body that has sold its energy for the day.</p>
<p>Night window, lonely lamp, lonely and impoverished sojourner, desolate, the taste of life's misery also floats in this realm.</p>
<p>Late at night, the moon outside the window has moved past the center of the river, and the barking of dogs in the street continues to rise and fall. Occasionally, an old passerby dragging his heels slowly swears past the window, accompanied by a hacking cough.</p>
<p>I close the book, put down the pen, stretch my waist, my eyes hurt so much that I can't support myself anymore. I prostrate myself on the box lid, my spirit exhausted.</p>
<p>As soon as I get into bed, the first thought that comes to mind!!</p>
<p>I wonder when the first month's 80% salary will be paid?</p>

<p>He swayed, looking unsteady. The waiter supported his shoulders, interrupting him:</p>
<p>"You've had too much to drink, 'conscience'… there's still tomorrow."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not drunk," he shook off the waiter's hand. "Dry dry… um, but have I poisoned anyone, xiangfu? Some people, you see, aren't they selling poison as white sugar? Exactly! Who points out that he is a murderer? No one!... White sugar, hey, white sugar! I broke the white sugar poison. Dry dry…"</p>
<p>He almost fell under the table. The waiter grabbed his arm.</p>
<p>"Drink tomorrow, old friend! Tomorrow."</p>
<p>He lowered his head, shaking his slightly collapsed bladder, his knuckles gripping the table tightly, and hummed a song.</p>
<p>"Drink, drink, drink!" His head hung on his back, foam flowing from the corner of his mouth. Struggling, he finally fell on the chair. "Drink… drank too much, too much! Wine is a deadly thing, wine!..."</p>
<p>Like a wild dog crying, he moaned loudly.</p>
<p>The seller of xiangfu was as unlucky as the weather. He was beaten by two!! Maybe more people.</p>
<p>Under the earthen embankment of the station, which had just rained, was full of mud and small puddles. Idle and not-so-idle people stepped back and forth, making a squeaking sound. From time to time, bursts of laughter erupted, clearly having watched for a long time, still with some dissatisfaction. There was no intention of dispersing for a while.</p>
<p>The murderer has already escaped. "Xiangfu" climbed out of the mire. The gray cloth gown was torn into several strips, soaked with mud and water. Blood flowed from the forehead, smeared on that rock-like face, mixed with mud. It flowed on the unclean mustache, rotating, dripping into the pool of water, creating a red halo, scattering like clouds.</p>

<h3>金融消息利於買戶金價曾出千元</h3>
<h3>Financial News Favors Buyers, Gold Price Once Exceeded One Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>最後漲度念元零九</p>
<p>Final Increase of Ten Yuan and Nine Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was driven by rumors favorable to buyers, coupled with continuous aggressive buying from powerful parties, firm sentiment among dealers, and weak selling pressure under heavy buying pressure. As a result, the foreign exchange market was unusually tight, and the trading floor was dry. It once traded above the one thousand yuan mark. In the morning, it was reported that the overseas silver market and the US market both contracted, and forward silver prices also saw continued declines. Although London pure gold did not change, the exchange rate shrank, and sentiment was very good. The over-the-counter preliminary trading opened and immediately rose to 982 yuan. The central bank's listed price was announced, and nothing changed. It was flat after opening, and although the bank supplied some, it was overwhelmed by the fierce buying from large players. Rumors spread that the central bank would continue to ship 25,000 cash bars for export, and that only 9,000 or so bars remained. The buying fever was quite strong and gradually rose. However, because the bank's appetite was still strong, it took advantage of the high price to supply sources, and gradually fell back after reaching a high point. The silver balancing tax was announced, levied at 7.75%, half a point lower than last Saturday. At this time, it was weak for a while. However, under the joint aggressive buying of large players, sellers panicked and fled. Afterwards, the upward trend rose again, but high sellers were slightly active. Afterwards, although there were large players who continued to buy, the overall trend had stabilized by noon, with only a few struggles in the middle. In the afternoon, large players came to buy aggressively over-the-counter, and the market was firm as soon as it opened. Rumors spread that our country was discussing restrictions on the outflow of silver, or prohibiting the circulation of silver between provinces. Generally powerful parties aggressively entered the market, and at the same time there was a flow of short covering. Dealer sentiment suddenly turned good, and sellers generally did not become active. The foreign exchange market was unusually tight, and the gold market continued to flourish. Powerful parties continued to buy aggressively, and sellers panicked under the trend of buying. The trading floor dried up, and the gold market formed a one-sided situation. Floating shorts had to painfully close their positions, so that it once traded above the one thousand yuan mark. The bank took advantage of the high price to supply, and the activity slightly declined. Before long, large players took profits and exited the market, and it fell back for a while.

<h3>Securities Foreign Exchange Rate Rises, Bond Market Fluctuations Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Day-long Oscillations with Mixed Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Short-Term Money High at Sixty-Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the foreign exchange rate suddenly jumped by twenty-one cents, causing renewed anxiety. Initial declines were sharp, but later, a head-and-shoulders pattern emerged, short covering led to a rebound. Trends changed in an instant, leaving speculators exhausted. However, financial circles believe the foreign exchange rate is unlikely to decline temporarily. This is due to cash outflows and active commercial activities in the interior requiring cash, reducing Shanghai's reserves, making further increases in the foreign exchange rate possible. With the settlement period approaching, the foreign exchange rate is prone to fluctuations, leading to corresponding market volatility. Yesterday's trend showed signs of a short squeeze. At the opening, selling pressure was strong, with No. 35 contracts experiencing the most selling, causing the price to plummet twelve cents to sixty-five cents, entirely influenced by the foreign exchange rate rising to twenty-one cents. The second session saw a rebound, also a reaction to the sharp decline, recovering ten and a half cents to thirty-five cents. In the afternoon, rumors of a head-and-shoulders pattern at twelve or three cents led to expectations that the foreign exchange rate would not rise further, causing a shift in trend. Front-end contracts were slightly lower by ten or twenty cents, while back-end contracts, starting with the unified tax bonds, gradually rose, with some gaining ten or twenty cents, calming anxieties somewhat. At the close, favorable news about the situation led to the cessation of selling of No. 35 contracts, and the market price gradually trended upward, gaining momentum. Short-term money surged by sixty-five cents after hours. Market results were inconsistent. Front-end contracts were lower by ten or twenty cents to forty-five cents, while back-end contracts, starting with the unified tax bonds, gradually rose. Short-term money surged by sixty-five cents. The outlook for long-term contracts was better, and bulls also engaged in some switching. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 20 million yuan. A comparative table of the gains and losses is listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Both Decline for Five Days, Then Marked Yarn Suddenly Soars</h3>
<p>After five consecutive days of decline, the yarn market suddenly rebounded today, due to rumors of a certain company's intention to take delivery in the near future, spreading throughout the market. At the same time, gold prices rose, further boosting confidence. General short covering activities caused the market to tighten. However, the bulls' actions still involved moving positions from one contract to another, and the volume was quite significant.</p>
<p>Rumors of Yarn Delivery in the Current Month Intensify</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session for marked yarn, market sentiment was stable due to weakness in the American and Indian cotton markets. However, bulls continued to hold on tightly to positions for the current month, with each month rising by one, two, three, or four cents. In the afternoon, rumors of a certain company taking delivery became widespread, further fueling buying interest. The rise in gold prices also contributed, causing market prices to tighten, with each month rising by eight or nine cents to one yuan and forty cents. The total trading volume for the day was 36,500 bales. Sales included 650 bales from Ji Feng, 650 bales from Da Feng, 700 bales from Jin Chang, 500 bales from Tong Xing, 650 bales from Gu Da, 4,250 bales from Yuan Yi, 850 bales from Yi Chang, 650 bales from Tong Fu, 1,000 bales from Yuan Da, and 500 bales from Yuan De.

<h3>Cotton Futures Sentiment Improves</h3>
<p>The cotton market was stable in the morning and rose in the afternoon, showing a strong trend, but overseas cotton market conditions remained weak. However, in the afternoon, news of gold bonds rising again to around 1,000 yuan, coupled with the rising yarn market, stimulated sentiment in the cotton market, leading to urgent short covering, and a rise of forty-five cents.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rebounds by Forty Cents</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session for purchased cotton futures, the market was flat due to the continued softening of foreign cotton. However, the trend turned slightly bullish towards the close, with near-term contracts unchanged and far-term contracts down five to fifteen cents. The market opened sharply higher in the afternoon, with a very strong trend, due to the rise in gold prices approaching the 1,000 yuan mark, greatly improving sentiment and boosting buying interest, with each month rising by thirty or forty cents. Total trading volume for the day was 77,500 dan. Sales included 1,100 dan from Da Fu, 2,300 dan from Ji Feng, 1,600 dan from Da Feng, 3,600 dan from Jun Chang, 4,700 dan from Yuan Da, 2,500 dan from Yi Kang, 2,800 dan from Tong Ji, 3,900 dan from Yuan Da, 1,000 dan from Jin Chang, and 1,000 dan from Yi Feng.

The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Factories Actively Purchasing Spot Cotton</p>

<h3>A Review of the American and Indian Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>In the New York cotton market on the 17th, a major spot trader purchased December contracts and sold far-term contracts. The opening saw some hedging and liquidation, but the favorable Liverpool telegraph had no impact. However, general buying was weak, and news became quiet, with prices falling slightly. Spot cotton was exceptionally tight, so once the excessive December positions are liquidated, market prices are expected to rise. Currently, traders are watching and waiting for new developments in the government's restrictions on next year's harvest. Market prices have been reported yesterday.</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market was firm last week, with speculators buying due to increased demand from Japan and Europe. Carriers also purchased. China gradually showed interest, but local factories were inactive, awaiting the influx of new cotton. The movement of new cotton has not increased, and sellers have no way to suppress prices, so basic prices are still able to maintain above the baseline. Actual sales of cloth are reported to be satisfactory. Attached is a summary of last week's statistics (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>1933 1954</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1st 98 135 Weekly Inventory 551 569 Cumulative Exports Since September 1st 125 183 Exports to Europe 82 66 Exports to China 41 10 Exports to Japan - 102 Other Regions 2 5</p>
<h3>Grains, Flour, and Wheat See Rebound</h3>
<p>After opening yesterday morning, the flour market turned from steady to firm, with quoted prices for foreign wheat showing gains of about ten to twenty cents for Chicago wheat. Canadian near-term prices were unchanged, while far-term prices were up about four cents. When prices were quoted, selling pressure was weak, and most factories were also watching. Business in returning goods for the current month was quite lively. Reports from Yingkou and Andong indicated that, partly due to the approaching river closure and partly due to tax increases, there was a rush to ship goods in recent days. Therefore, sentiment for each month was calm, with a hint of strength. When the afternoon session opened, the current month saw continued withdrawals by merchants, and factories also made some short covering. Trading in far-term months was not active, but with few new shorts, outside interest remained strong, so market sentiment was uniformly good. As a result, the current month rose by 2.5 cents, December rose by 2.5 cents, January rose by 2 cents, February rose by 2 cents, 1.5 cents, March rose by 2 cents, and April rose by 1.75 cents.</p>
<p>When wheat prices were quoted, sellers were scarce, and sentiment among traders was slightly tight. In the market, because the domestic wheat inventory was declining, it was difficult to find abundant sellers. Therefore, without foreign wheat as a bargaining chip, future development would naturally be difficult, so it was not easy to see declines. In the afternoon sessions, trading remained light, and prices were stable, with little fluctuation compared to the morning. As a result, the current month was better by two cents, December was better by four cents, January was better by three cents, February was better by one cent, and March was better by three cents. In the spot wheat market, high-quality wheat remained stable, while medium and lower-quality wheat were slightly softer by one or two cents. Kaishan Che Bai wheat was 3.82 yuan, Hong wheat was 3.80 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 3.79 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat was 3.75 yuan, totaling 2,000 bags, which were handled by Fu Feng.</p>
<p>Chicago's coarse grain market is trending upward. Reports indicate damage to Australian wheat, and the American Southwest is still experiencing drought with no rain. Although harvest news is bad, weak international market conditions have prevented wheat from rising. Trading is light, but due to the scarcity of corn arrivals and the lack of selling, there is strong support. Wheat also received a corresponding boost and saw slight gains. However, it is generally believed that continued price increases may trigger imports of foreign grains.</p>
<h3>Various Rice Sources Strengthen</h3>
<p>Market Price: Declines; Yin Yuan Alone Rises</p>
<p>Rice: Yesterday, more than thirty sources in South Shanghai (with nearly 5,000 piculs of goods) faced sluggish sales, and sentiment was extremely weak. Merchants made purchase commitments, with Ningbo merchants handling over a hundred bags and Northern Ocean Yantai varieties continuing to arrive in batches of four or five hundred bags. However, selection was extremely strict, with a preference for high-quality goods. Demand for these was particularly strong. Various late-season rice continued to fall by ten or twenty cents, with thick-grained rice falling by a small amount. Only Su Tong bang japonica rice, due to limited arrivals, had not yet followed the decline. The bleak outlook for Du Yang jian and Rong Jian rice was evident, following a decline of about twenty cents in downstream prices. As for Yin Yuan rice, it was heavily sourced by wine merchant groups in the interior, resulting in a flood of arrivals. Sentiment was tight and bullish, and the market was exceptionally brisk. As for the North Shanghai area, there were more than twenty arriving ships, with a river inventory of one hundred forty to fifty vessels. In terms of market sales, new japonica, broken japonica, new Yang Du Bu Jian, and other varieties were all sluggish. Chen Bai Yuan rice faced sluggish sales due to large arrivals. Thin-grained rice saw some transactions with price reductions. Ke Jian rice was flat. New japonica rice, excluding high-quality rice, was down by small amounts. Medium and lower-quality rice was down by two small amounts. Thin-grained rice was down by one or two small amounts. New Yang Jian Du Jian rice was down by one small amount. Chen Bai Yuan rice was down by two or three small amounts. Broken-grained Ke Jian rice was flat.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Sources increased, and sentiment trended downward. Yesterday, new Xiang rice arrivals totaled 24,500 bags, with another 15,000 to 16,000 bags already en route. Fortunately, internal digestion remained active, and prices were down by small amounts to twenty cents. A total of 4,500 bags of various Xian rice were offered throughout the day, with most being handled internally.</p>
<p>Yang Rice: Yesterday, affected by Ke Xian rice, it also fell by a small five cents, and with fixed orders arriving daily, the future outlook was very uncertain. Qi Mi, Yue Yong Da, and others were trying to sell off stock. Yesterday, returning rice was down by a small five cents. New transactions were still being negotiated. However, Siam Yuan rice was sought after by merchants in this district, and yesterday it rose by one cent, alone. Only one hundred bags were offered throughout the day, as there were few supplies arriving and in stock. Qi Mi totaled 850 tons, and current Saigon and other varieties totaled 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Arrivals Remain Limited</h3>
<p>- Unfinished with Thousands -</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow soybean market rose by another five or six cents compared to Saturday. The current foothold is quite stable, due to transportation disruptions. Only shipments of Henan goods continued to arrive by water, but in small quantities. The price of goods from Zhuangniu by sea transport was high, and arrivals were also small, causing the market to rise again. Waste processing factories showed strong appetite for beans, making Chen soybeans from Yingzhou, with limited arrivals, even more popular. The market opened from 3.44 yuan to 3.35 yuan, with thirteen or fourteen carloads changing hands, destined for factories, tin and Changzhou oil mills, and Guide. New soybeans traded for 3.335 yuan to 3.30 yuan, also destined for tin and Changzhou and this district. There were also new soybeans from Xin'anzhen traded for 3.29 yuan to 3.26 yuan, also destined for the stomach of tin and Changzhou. The remaining various soybeans traded for over 800 bags, purchased by this district and customers.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Luzhuang, Zhenmei, and European Sales Are Robust</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, English merchants such as Xiehe, Yihua, Fushi, and other firms actively sought to buy Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Zunan, due to demand telegraphed from abroad. Tea prices were not high, but they spared no effort. The entire market traded more than seven hundred ____. Wuhu Gao Zhuang goods opened at 84 yuan for top-grade tea, Tunxi goods sold for 68 yuan, and Suian goods sold for 50 yuan, with no change from last week. Only the total sales ____ of silk and tea varieties, such as ____ Zhuang, were said to have had some sporadic negotiations, but due to the tightening of foreign rice prices, no transactions were made, and the situation was quite dull.</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Shao Xiaoyuan Welcomes with Lanterns, Pale and Weary, Driven by Hunger, Learning to Apply Powder to Pursue a Flirtatious Style</p>
<p>While Auntie Hu was rejecting Jia Duocai in that manner, the most cunning tea house worker in this Little Western Heaven, called Little Ji, was idly watching from the side. He then laughed at Auntie Hu and said, "Hey! Are you crazy because you're poor?" Auntie Hu was still upset by Jia Duocai's words, unable to stand steady, holding onto the courtyard door, watching Jia Duocai leave. Now, seeing Little Ji also teasing her, she glared and said, "Poor as I may be, I'm not crazy. I know more than you young punks." Little Ji sneered, "You say you know more? No matter what, you shouldn't offend the God of Wealth, right? Do you know what that Mr. Jia does? He works at a bank. He scoops up money with his hands." Auntie Hu looked Little Ji up and down, checking if he was lying, and mused, "Does he look like he works at a bank?" Little Ji said, "What should people at a bank look like? Should they have banknotes pasted on their faces?" Auntie Hu laughed, "That's not what I meant. I thought people at a bank would all be prosperous and happy, with big heads and round faces. But that person is skinny." Little Ji raised his right hand, snapped his middle finger and thumb together, and slapped Auntie Hu's face, laughing, "Stop showing off how much you know! Rich people these days aren't like they used to be, looking like fat pigs. They're thinking day and night about how to make money off money, so they all want to be thin. The richer they are, the easier it is for them to be thin now." Auntie Hu laughed, "If that's the case, you should have a hundred and eighty thousand! Aren't you very thin?" Little Ji straightened his face and said in a low voice, "I'm not joking. That Mr. Jia is really rich. Aren't you trying to find a rich husband for your relative? He's also looking for someone in Xi'an. The two of you would be a perfect match. Why did you offend him?" (68)</p>
<h3>Seeking a Grave in Jinshan</h3>
<p>— By Yi Zhen</p>
<p>I happened to be browsing the "Jinshan Chronicle" when I came across a very interesting historical account, telling the story of a national hero: "Xu Mingshan was a native of Lüxiang Town's Maowan, during the Yongjia period of the Ming Dynasty. Japanese pirates landed at Jinshanwei and invaded Song County, with Jinshan bearing the brunt and suffering the most destruction. The pirates, unfamiliar with the roads, forced Mingshan to be their guide. Mingshan pretended to cooperate. It was extremely cold. The pirates, unaccustomed to the cold, suffered. Mingshan suggested that Jiangnan rice straw was better than cotton batting. The pirates ordered him to prepare it. Mingshan chose a large building and built straw huts to house the pirates. The pirates were delighted. One day, during a feast, Mingshan secretly set fire, surrounding them completely. Thousands of pirates died without a single survivor."</p>
<p>Because I have friends in Lüxiang, I took a boat there, partly to visit my friends and partly to investigate this matter. When I arrived, I talked to Mr. Jin about this story, but he didn't know about it. He said, "Maowan is just seven or eight miles northeast of our town. How about we go take a walk there!" The next morning, we walked there, hoping to find Xu Yi's tomb and learn more about his life.</p>
<p>Disappointment! We were unable to obtain any additional information for most of the day. Later, we got some information from an old Daoist priest who lived in the area. Xu Mingshan was a native of Maojing Township, a dissolute and unconventional person, without a fixed occupation, wandering everywhere. He was fond of alcohol and would always get drunk. After getting drunk, he would be particularly unrestrained. The local folk song "Ask Xu Mingsheng to buy wine" refers to this. After killing the enemies, Xu went mad and died drunk half a year later. Xu's tomb is no longer traceable, and the whereabouts of his descendants are unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, the Provincial Department of Education notified the township to adopt Xu Yi's deeds as supplementary reading material for the national language textbook for primary schools, and ordered public institutions to erect a monument to commemorate the beginning and end of this event. Xu Yi, if he knows in the afterlife, can be comforted.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Ji Jue)</p>
<p>The provisional constitution states that men and women are equal before the law, but the different regulations for internal and external relatives, and the prohibition of marriage between cousins but not between maternal cousins, seem to still not have removed the old customs of "male-centeredness."</p>
<p>"Rape of a girl under the age of fourteen is considered rape." So, raping a girl who is fourteen years and one day old is not considered rape. So, it is said that the law is a dead thing and cannot regulate people who evade and violate the law.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Four Friends</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have four friends, each with their own environment and personality, so their views on life are also different. Originally, I planned to create portraits for each of them, but due to certain reasons (this phrase is from the public dictionary). I couldn't. Here, I will just quickly sketch a few lines.</p>
<p>One friend has some of the remaining style of a "Yellow-Clad Knight," likes to meddle in other people's business, and stand up for the wronged, but he also has his principles. Often, a small matter, after his involvement, is guaranteed to expand in scale, "advancing a thousand miles in a day." If he is fortunate enough to achieve final victory, he is naturally a hero. Once he feels that the matter is tricky, he changes his course and shows his principles, turning his head and no longer caring. He even complains about others: "Working with you people won't have good results."</p>
<p>One friend is kind and approachable, with a smile often floating on the corners of his mouth, never speaking harshly. He treats everyone equally. He doesn't give money to beggars with frost on their temples when they reach out to him. But he is not an uncharitable person. He says: "You are so old, why are you still wandering around? Why don't you stay at home and enjoy your old age?" When he meets people of the same class, he has no criticism of anything, everything is "Good! Good!" Even if someone defecates against a wall corner, he will say to people: "Your posture when you urinate is truly poetic!"</p>
<p>One friend is very cunning. He is used to attacking people in the shadows, and his art of speaking is highly skilled. In front of people, he is always able to handle everything perfectly, a picture of harmony. Who knows that this person harbors ill intentions and is a bundle of other intentions! In addition, he has special skills that can cause conflict between people and can eat their food and drink their wine every day without making them angry, and make them want to be close to him. It's just strange that although he drinks generously, he always gets drunk, and the wine bill is always paid by others. He does not notice the expensive cigarettes that others have forgotten on the table, but he sees them clearly and takes them away every time.</p>
<p>One friend is a gentle and refined gentleman. Although he hasn't read many books, he has learned some of the superficial knowledge of "lowly talents" and also likes to play the pipa, or play a game of chess with the accountant of the coffin shop. In writing, he is uniquely gifted, with a good hand in Yan Lugong's calligraphy style, with a strange power in his strokes! His good neighbor, Auntie San Hao, sees him practicing calligraphy and always praises him for being square, upright, thick and large! At the end of last year's lunar calendar, she specially bought a piece of red paper, cut it in half, and respectfully asked him to write spring couplets. He surprisingly agreed readily, without hesitation, and completed it in one stroke, the couplet reading: "The days are rich in resources and natural treasures, the people are outstanding and the place is spiritually gifted."</p>
<h3>Small Tea House</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shoutong</p>
<p>In a village with twenty or thirty households, there is usually a small tea house. It is also a house covered with straw, but a large red square signboard with the word "Tea" painted on it hangs outside, attracting people's attention. The furnishings inside the house are also very simple, with a few tables and long benches placed around them. The tea sets are of course not exquisite or elegant. It is already rare to see one that is complete, without any chips or cracks.</p>
<p>The tea drinkers are mostly farmers from the surrounding area. Their purpose is not to quench their thirst but to take a break, or to find an acquaintance to chat with. Sometimes, peddlers carrying baskets and selling cigarettes, peanuts, melon seeds, sugar, and other things pass by, catering to their needs even more.</p>
<p>Here, time has lost its value. They are all leisurely and content, without any sense of urgency. Sitting idly for half a day is not considered strange. Some, bored to the extreme, fall asleep on the table. When they wake up, the sun is already setting, and they reluctantly return home.</p>
<p>The windows are not inlaid with glass, but pasted with white paper, which has turned grayish-white after a long time of wind and sun exposure, making the house unusually dark. The oil lamp next to the tea stove often flickers and threatens to go out in the gentle breeze, making the atmosphere seem particularly quiet. This can indeed make people feel a sense of poetry.</p>
<p>Small Horticulture</p>
<h3>Flower and Fruit Sketches</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>One: Lychnis coronaria</p>
<p>Autumn flowers flourish late in the year, not vying with spring's colors. Lychnis coronaria is one such flower, also known as Lychnis coronaria alba, or Han Palace Autumn. It is a perennial herb. Its leaves resemble those of Lychnis coronaria, its stems grow two to three feet tall, with fine hairs growing in clusters. In mid-autumn, it bears flowers in white, deep crimson, and light blue-green. Its petals are divided into several pointed and charming branches. It blooms for a long time, even until the end of autumn. It prefers shade. After the vernal equinox, divide and transplant it into fertile soil, watering it with clear spring water. Avoid exposing it to the hot sun. If planting seeds, place rice seedlings over them to protect them from heavy rain. Another type of flower, with yellow blossoms, is called Lychnis coronaria flos-cuculi, which is also particularly vibrant. Some say they are all appendages of daylilies.</p>
<p>Crush the leaves of Lychnis coronaria and mix them with sesame oil to treat ringworm. This was told to me by my friend Xu Zhongzhou, who said it is very effective.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaixiang, a proofreader from Yangzhou, was elegant and refined, skilled in poetry and lyrics, and enjoyed associating with famous scholars. Her poems and lyrics often expressed feelings of loneliness and self-pity. She wrote a poem about Lychnis coronaria: [Several generations wither in the setting sun, cold buds and sparse branches are still red, do not imitate light silk to make a fan; lest you be abandoned by the Han Garden in the autumn wind]. It expresses a pitiful sentiment, and reading it is haunting.</p>
<p>Two: Asparagus Fern</p>
<p>Bamboo possesses the charm of the Qi and Ao shores and the aspiration to soar into the clouds. However, there is also a kind that is short and stout, used for elegant offerings in study rooms, which is the asparagus fern. It is a special type of bamboo. Planting a few stems in a pot evokes thoughts of the Wei River. Xiangzhong Ji states: [Gao Ping County has an Asparagus Fern Mountain, on which there is a stone bed, surrounded by lush green bamboo, swaying in the wind over this bed. Gao Ping is now Xinhua County.]</p>
<p>My teacher, Hu Shiyu of Yufeng, loved to grow asparagus ferns. He once said: [Asparagus ferns are secluded, graceful, and deep green. Looking at them is like seeing a newly woven forest, with varying density, naturally charming. They are excellent for potted landscapes. However, if not planted properly, they will grow too tall and easily become crooked, losing their beauty. To avoid this, do not expose them to dew at night, as this will prevent them from growing too long. Also, do not place them next to walls, as the wind reflected from the walls will cause them to lean and become crooked. Another method is to mix furnace ash into the soil when planting, which will provide nourishment and prevent them from growing too long, as furnace ash has no nutrients. Approximately seven parts soil and three parts ash is the most suitable. It is also best to use white oil tile pots or white porcelain pots, to contrast with the green color. You can also place small stones in the pot to create a scenic view, making it an excellent item for nurturing the eyes at the desk.]</p>
<p>Gu Heyi of my Wu region, served as a libationer in the Imperial Garden, and has now passed away for many years. Heyi once wrote a study room plaque that read "Yangmei Culture Home". At first glance, one might think it referred to the red and dense peaks adorning his courtyard. In fact, "Yangmei" refers to Yang Buzhi's plum blossom paintings, and "Wenzhu" refers to Wen Yuke's bamboo paintings. These are rare treasures passed down through generations, and the Gu family collected ancient paintings and calligraphy, thus the name.</p>
<p>Three: Jackfruit</p>
<p>Among the fruits with abundant sweet juice, besides watermelon and coconut, jackfruit should be considered an excellent choice. "Jackfruit" is originally a Sanskrit word, meaning "crossing to the other shore," referring to crossing from this shore of life and death to the other shore of Nirvana. It was adopted as the name of the fruit starting in the Ming Dynasty. Leihan states: [The sweet food room of the Ming Guanglu Temple was managed by eunuchs, specializing in making candy for offerings before the Buddha, called jackfruit.]</p>
<p>The tree is an evergreen tree, produced in Lingnan and eastern India. Its leaves are obovate, its flowers are small, clustered into spikes, its fruit is elliptical. Each tree can bear more than ten fruits, or five or six at least. It is covered with a thick, thorny skin. Each fruit can weigh two to three catties. The outer skin is carved away, and the flesh is layered like tangerine segments. It is occasionally sold in Shanghai fruit shops. The most common form is canned, boiled into a sweet treat for banquets, which is quite delicious.</p>
<h3>Fragrant Shadows: A Record of Imperial Life</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I lingered in the long corridor for about half an hour, gradually feeling tired. Firstly, I was indeed very tired today and genuinely needed some rest. Secondly, standing alone and coldly in the corridor was too desolate. So, I went into my bedroom, lay down on the bed, and planned to have a short, sweet dream. But even with my eyes closed, I couldn't fall asleep easily, only dozing off faintly. Just as I was about to fall into a deep sleep, a palace maid came and woke me up, telling me that the Empress Dowager had stirred and would wake up in a few minutes. So, the palace maid hurried to inform me, so I could quickly get dressed and ready, and as soon as she woke up, I could immediately go in to attend to her.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager indeed woke up after ten minutes. The old lady had to go through the process of washing and dressing again. By this time, it was already quite late. After chatting with us casually for a while, it was time for dinner. Then, the usual set of elaborate rituals began. As usual, the hundred bowls of main dishes, many of which were impractical, were brought out like a parade, filling the table in front of the Empress Dowager. I was simply afraid of them, but it was the custom. Whether in the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Summer Palace, or on the imperial train, regardless of the location, these hundred bowls of dishes were always required for every meal. Now that we were in Fengtian, there was no exception.</p>
<p>After dinner, everyone was still gathered in the Empress Dowager's private chamber. She didn't seem to pay much attention to this new environment. She didn't even think about taking a candlelit tour, and didn't even mention it in her conversation, as if she had never been to Fengtian at all. (178)</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Conversations</p>
<h3>Reconsidering the Adultery Law in the New Criminal Code</h3>
<p>— Pi</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan recently passed Article 239 of the draft criminal code: [A married woman who commits adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year; the person with whom she commits adultery shall be punished in the same way.] However, if a married man commits adultery, there is no provision for punishment, which has led to the "Amazonian Army" raising a hue and cry to demand justice.</p>
<p>It is now known that the Central Political Conference has passed a resolution, in accordance with the principle of gender equality, to send it back to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The outcome of this reconsideration is being closely watched by people across the country. According to reliable sources, there are two possible outcomes of the reconsideration:</p>
<p>1.  Married women or married men who commit adultery shall be punished equally (however, to take into account practical difficulties, an additional clause must be added for the latter).</p>
<p>2.  Neither married women nor married men who commit adultery shall be punished.</p>
<p>In my opinion, although the first option provides for equal punishment, the need to add an additional clause for the latter means that equality is not fully achieved. It would be better to adopt the second approach, which is more direct and straightforward.</p>
<p>Mencius said, [Food and sex are human nature.] Confucius said, [I have never seen anyone who loves virtue as much as they love beauty.] Thus, the need for sex is something that even sages and wise men cannot avoid. Moreover, the need for sex is the same for both men and women. It cannot be entirely blamed on men, nor can it be entirely blamed on women. Originally, this kind of event is a physiological secret, a mischievous trick of nature, and not a shocking thing.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, a marital system has been established, with so-called [Three Obediences and Four Virtues] and [Staying faithful until death.] Song Confucianism made it even more extreme, with the saying [Starve to death rather than remarry, losing chastity is a grave matter.] Since then, there has been much trouble between husband and wife.</p>
<p>In fact, despotic marriages emphasize law, while free marriages emphasize morality. If one party in a marriage commits adultery, they cannot escape legal responsibility, and they cannot escape moral responsibility either. But if we carefully examine acts of petty theft, I am afraid that it is more than 20-30% as Dr. Wang mentioned. Therefore, the issue of sex should be allowed to run its natural course, and there is no need to impose strict legal restrictions.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a married woman or a married man commits adultery, their feelings for their husband or wife have already faded, needless to say. The most straightforward and satisfying solution is for both parties to end their relationship, or to let things run their natural course. Therefore, the ancients said, [Wives and children are like clothes, brothers are like limbs.] [You can go with whomever you love,] which is mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>The world's marriage systems are not fixed. There are polygamous systems and polyandrous systems. In some parts of Southeast Asia, several brothers marry one wife together. In other places, there is the custom of "renting a womb" (for example, A's wife can be rented to B for a certain number of years, with B paying A a certain amount of rent to have a child). Such situations are determined by different times and social structures. Relying solely on legal restrictions is not very effective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if marriage is absolutely free, then divorce should also be absolutely free. Therefore, the precedents for divorce conditions established by the Judicial Yuan the other day were extremely lenient. The explanation is: the so-called abuse that makes cohabitation unbearable [is not limited to physical abuse, but also includes mental suffering that makes cohabitation unbearable] and divorce is permissible. How much more necessary is divorce when one party in a marriage commits adultery? This will save judges a lot of trouble, and reduce a lot of messy entanglements between husband and wife, which is a good thing.</p>
<h3>The Colors of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>— Record of Impressions of Beiping, Part Two —</p>
<p>Colors can influence people's emotions. Blue brings tranquility, white brings purity, red brings excitement, and peach blossom pink brings tenderness. These are all examples.</p>
<p>In any case, it is difficult for Beiping to excite people. I remember when a Russian blind poet came to Beiping, he sighed, [It is so lonely.] This is true. Beiping is truly lonely. To use an analogy, it is like a once-glorious family that has now fallen into decline, leaving only an empty and almost desolate courtyard.</p>
<p>If I were to compare Beiping to a medieval castle or a modern city, I would say that Beiping is more like a castle and lacks the flavor of a modern city. Although it has a population of over one million, these people have not modernized Beiping. There are no towering Western-style buildings, no smoky air, and no crowds rushing to collide with each other. In Beiping, people are leisurely, like the White Pagoda and the city towers. It's interesting to note that even Beiping's trams - perhaps because they are too old and too heavy - also feel leisurely.</p>
<p>Every day around four or five o'clock in the afternoon, my courtyard becomes so quiet that you can hear the sunflower roots absorbing water. The setting sun shines through the small alley, casting its light on the east-facing house. The old gray roof tiles look like an old man's eyes watching me. When I open the curtains, if a small sparrow flies down into the yard, the sound of its feet is very interesting. Its panicked flight truly highlights the loneliness of the small courtyard. The sunflowers turn their faces away, as if unable to bear the sight of the setting sun, while the afterglow on the tiled roof makes the pale yellow flowers appear even more lonely. At this time, I hear the clattering of carts in the alley, the sound of iron-rimmed wheels rolling over the bumpy ground, stirring up dust and moving away. A shout from a wall corner, a sudden cry for sale, sometimes sounds like soil falling in an ancient tomb passage. A crack of a whip! Snap! The reverberating sound can still be heard bouncing off the gray walls. The sound of a candy gong, there must be a long shadow moving in the alley, followed by the shouts of children. All of this is lonely. To say that Beiping is a modern city! Is this what a modern city is like?</p>
<p>The night in Beiping is especially lonely. Around ten o'clock, even the most lively places become deserted. At that time, you can hear people coughing on the street, rickshaw pullers wearily dragging their carts and humming tunes, the distant sound of shops closing their doors. Under the streetlights, a few laborers are gathered around, breathing out white smoke. The night in a big city is not like this.</p>
<p>As the night deepens, the sound of clappers, dogs barking, and trains whistling fill the lonely space.</p>
<p>Isn't this an ancient castle? So leisurely, so lonely.</p>
<p>The color that represents this leisure and loneliness, which is close to decay, is gray.</p>
<h3>Only Burning Incense When You Need Help</h3>
<p>— Pan Huzhao</p>
<h3>By the Furnace</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Shovelful after shovelful of coal particles are sent into the furnace. The raging flames keep rising. They seem to be as red as blood, and the black coal particles turn into red fire bricks. The few people standing by the furnace are scorched and blackened, becoming as frightening as natives of South Africa. Their blood is completely dried by this extremely high heat of a thousand degrees. A mouth that can only twitch and a pair of lifeless white eyeballs are embedded in their oily, black faces. The hands that are stretched out are as black as iron and as dry as firewood. Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, they stand by that furnace all day long, putting chunks or strips of iron into the furnace, letting the raging flames scorch them, and then scooping out chunks of red cakes from the blood-red flames, placing them on iron anvils. Then, every hammer pounds on those red cakes. Countless sparks fly into the air, flying onto the walls, onto their bodies, and even onto their faces. They pound until it can't breathe, stopping only when the red turns gray-black, but then they go on to pound the second piece.</p>
<p>Their lives are without end. They live all day long in that black house filled with coal dust. A furnace is the source of their livelihood. After hammering iron all day long, they barely have a chance to take a breath, except for the time to eat and sleep. In the evening, they throw their exhausted and poisoned bodies into that dirty, tattered quilt. This is the unique price they pay for a day of hard labor - the only rest. They always think of themselves as born to be bitter bones, and it is already very lucky to be able to not go hungry!</p>
<h3>Bowing Low Now, Kicking You Later</h3>
<p>— Dong Wenyuan</p>
<p>Being able to bend and stretch is what makes a great man. When there is no other way, crawling through a dog hole is the true nature of a hero. Throughout history, heroic men have used this to achieve success. Therefore, in today's world, there is no shortage of people who can [bow low now and kick you later].</p>
<p>Because in this ladder-like society, everyone wants to climb up. However, if you don't climb well, you will fall down. So, smart people engage in studying the secrets of this, and invent the art of climbing the ladder, which is the way to success. The so-called art of climbing the ladder is nothing more than:</p>
<p>— Bowing low now, kicking you later.</p>
<p>That is, when there is no other way at this time, great men and heroes must bow their heads and seek to preserve themselves, and engage in living by crawling through dog holes. When someone sticks out their leg to kick, they kneel down and beg bitterly:</p>
<p>— Have pity on me! Please help me, let me have some food.</p>
<p>If the person withdraws their leg and doesn't kick you, then crawl into the dog hole, which is to say, climb up one step of the ladder. Then, people who had no food to eat become people who have food to eat. Take a rest, then look up again. In begging, bowing, and enduring hardship, they find a way to climb up another step, making this endless effort, all the way to climbing to the top of the ladder, in order to achieve the goal of leaping over the Dragon Gate.</p>
<p>However, while he is climbing up, he also does the work of kicking people. As soon as he climbs up the first step, he immediately kicks away the first step, and begs to the one on the second step. Because in this way, on the one hand, it saves squeezing when climbing, and on the other hand, it eliminates future troubles. Originally, by the time he finishes climbing the ladder, everyone on the ladder has already been kicked away. Wouldn't it be possible to live a carefree and smug life forever?</p>
<p>Therefore, people today, if they want to succeed and enjoy wealth, must learn this set of skills. Otherwise, how can they talk about being a great man or a hero?</p>
<p>If there is only one such heroic man, it doesn't matter. But when there are two or three, then it's simply terrible! You crawl, I crawl, you kick, I kick, and society will never be peaceful. At the same time, the ordinary people suffer.</p>
<p>Their inherent position in society is taken over, and as a result, even eating a meal will be kicked down. Sometimes they fall and get their heads broken and bleed to death, while the people on the ladder clap their hands and laugh, beside themselves with joy.</p>
<p>I wonder when another art will replace this one.</p>
<h3>East, West, North, South</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>When I was a child, I liked to read martial arts novels, and I really yearned for those characters with two white lights flashing from their eyes. Although I never wrapped myself up in the middle of the night and jumped out of the window to try it out.</p>
<p>This year, martial artist Zhang Xuebin set up plum blossom poles in the Dahua Garden in Shanghai. This is definitely worth seeing. But due to some small matters, it was delayed, and I lost the [once-in-a-thousand-years] opportunity. There's no way to deal with it except to chant Amitabha.</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper this morning, I found several pieces of [genuine] plum blossom stakes, the Shanghai people's good fortune is [genuine] not shallow.</p>
<p>Whether Zhang Xuebin's plum blossom stakes are real or fake, because I didn't see them with my own eyes, I can't speculate. In fact, even if I saw them, people who don't know the goods are like blind people, and we are still confused. Now, according to this well-known figure's advertisement, it is obviously a [genuine old brand], so naturally, I want to see it first, without any doubt.</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, [Mr. Wang] was performing in the Central Theatre. Because he [personally went on stage], it caused misunderstandings. Later, in Southeast, he called himself a [fake] Mr. Wang. By chance, compared with the current [genuine] plum blossom stakes, [genuine] is humorous enough!</p>
<h3>Scattered Notes on Walking</h3>
<p>— Jin Ren</p>
<p>Since I came into contact with Shanghai society, it has been quite a while. I feel that to learn some art of being a person (being a person in Shanghai), it is best to run to the street, what the ears hear and the eyes see, is definitely not something that a few ABC books can match.</p>
<p>At the cigarette exchange shop in the army station, the exchange value is never as much as written on the sign, and mixed change and foreign coins are all exchanged as whole prices. Although similar things happen everywhere, why is it particularly common at tram stations? And everyone can slightly know about this drawback, but no one tries to avoid it during this necessary time. At the same time, there are particularly many beggars at the tram stations. Their art of saying good things is also surprising. They only need to say appropriate good things based on the object's clothing and actions. That kind of skillful recitation is exactly what some people have been thinking about but haven't expressed; some people have considerable experience with their good words and get annoyed. That generous copper coin is exactly what they hope for. But before this matter has come to a conclusion, unless the tram you are waiting for is just rushing by, otherwise, one after another, they can use the story of you giving one copper coin as the basis for them to say good things. Naturally, they don't come to grab it from your hand, but it is very difficult to keep those two copper coins safe.</p>
<p>These two things are the most common things that happen thousands of times every day in Shanghai. If you think that the art of being a person is only like this, then I am the first great sinner in the world. We need to see through the truth of these two things, that is, why these two things happen so universally and so quickly. There is the art of being a person in between. Suppose you become the boss of a cigarette exchange shop, (this is quite possible) or become a beggar, (this is a very big joke, but someone studied the truth of [death], and made it true by hanging himself, trying to be a beggar once, maybe you are not an incurable person, in terms of self-reliance, you have a great personality, so maybe it's not a joke. If you are in the midst of it, you will know that this little bit of art is greatly related to the way of being a person!</p>
<p>I am going to say another sentence that makes people distrust me, the street is the most unequal place. Although it is said that both the rich and the poor can walk on this street, it is precisely because the rich and the poor are all on this street that unequal things happen. But knowing the saying of "wise men protect themselves", you can take the best policy of the thirty-six stratagems to turn misfortune into good fortune, as long as you don't get involved in the vortex. The most important thing to avoid on the street is to be passionate and generous. This is called the philosophy of life in the art of being a person, and it seems to be something that everyone knows. There are not a few cases where the fish in the pond are affected by the heat.</p>
<p>If I were to describe it in detail, it would not be possible to accommodate it in a short thousand-character space, and there are many things that I have not discovered yet. In the future, when I am free, I will do something like a history of Chinese literature, and I hope that comrades will join in this grand event.</p>
<p>Finally, I declare that when doing this kind of work, don't wear clothes that are too tattered, otherwise it is a huge obstacle. I spend several hours every day on the street, and I always wear a tiger skin suit. Although the price is not very high, the style is very fashionable. One day it rained, and because I didn't have a raincoat, I wore a long gown and carried an umbrella. I was still caught by the kind gentleman in the window of Edward Road, who went straight to the point and said that my luck had been bad recently and I was destined to lose money. Although I went through his several [no], I finally turned around and left. This was a great disappointment for him, precisely because his art of being a person was not perfect.</p>

<h3>Architecture of Greece and Rome (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>(A) Greek Architecture</p>
<p>The reason why Greek architecture was so developed was largely due to its beautiful environment. Greece can truly be said to be a place favored by heaven; few other places in the world can compare to it in terms of perfect mountain and water scenery. Therefore, its people were nurtured by natural beauty, and their aesthetic sense was extremely developed. Naturally, their architecture was particularly full of beauty and grandeur. From its architecture, we can see that the Greeks loved to use simple straight lines and paid more attention to the expression of strength.</p>
<p>Greek religion was different from the Egyptian religion we mentioned earlier; it was not something containing terror. What it worshipped were only three imaginary concepts: beauty, truth, and goodness. These three imaginary concepts were dissolved in the lives of the discerning Greeks.</p>
<p>Another special point revealed in their culture and architecture is that the national spirit of the Greeks was very strong. Although slavery had not yet been abolished at that time, it was only a kind of private inheritance. Slaves could no longer be subjected to the tyranny of autocratic kings. Competition between their cities was quite fierce. The residents of each city had to praise the advantages of their city and do their best to make it beautiful. Therefore, Greek architecture, such as temples and public buildings, can be said to have been built not by relying on the hard labor of slaves, but entirely by a kind of loving and sincere work.</p>
<p>The Greeks were a very rational people. Any part of the houses they built must first have considerable use. Therefore, the columns in their architecture were not used for decoration; each column carried a part of the weight of the house. They did not like to use curved or any curved architectural methods, thinking that these lacked the strength and grandeur of straight lines. Therefore, they specialized in using straight columns and straight lines to build many great wonders, becoming a school in architectural history.</p>
<p>However, the Greeks did not suddenly invent a new architectural method; they also gradually improved it. After a house was successfully built, they would carefully study how to improve each part to make it beautiful, and then the entire project would gradually become perfect. This is the secret of the success of Greek architects.</p>
<p>Because Greek religion did not contain terror, its architecture did not need to make worshippers feel awe. It was just a place for gods and people to worship, and the air was filled with the atmosphere of heavenly peace. Worshippers all stayed in the open space outside the temple to worship. Therefore, Greek temples were not very large, and they could focus all their energy on developing the beauty of architecture. This kind of shift from quantitative considerations to qualitative research is a major sign of progress in art.</p>
<p>The different styles of Greek architecture can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>1. Doric</p>
<p>2. Ionic</p>
<p>3. Corinthian</p>
<p>The differences between the three styles lie entirely in the differences in the capitals and entablature. The so-called capital refers to the upper end of the column, and its decoration can have various different forms. The so-called entablature is the part that is straight on the column, including the architrave and the frieze. Between the entablature and the roof is the so-called pediment. Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian are named after the names of the races of their creators. We sometimes call them three "orders" because their differences are mostly on the columns.</p>
<p>Relying on their artistic talent, the Greeks created countless great buildings from these three orders. The most noble of these were their temples, which were designed very simply, but all were extremely cleverly perfect. These temples were not mysterious and unpredictable holy temples, so they were not as dark and massive as Egyptian temples. Their beauty was to be shown in the bright sunlight, displaying the neatness and solemnity of each part.</p>
<p>However, the Greeks did not pay much attention to the architecture of their dwellings. Most of them were very small houses, because they usually liked to go to public places such as markets, theaters, and temples and did not live at home often. Therefore, these ancient cities were filled with rows of houses like small white blocks, with nothing noteworthy. However, those public buildings were very neat and decorated very beautifully. Even though they are now badly damaged, they can still show the respectable work of the people of the past.</p>
<h3>The Great Value of Chinese Religious Architecture</h3>
<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>Temples, monasteries, pagodas and beyond,</p>
<p>Buddhist statues are the most mysterious and artistic.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang inspects Yungang,</p>
<p>And examines the records of our country's history.</p>
<p>I have examined historical records of our country and they reveal that the general architecture of East Asia during the Middle Ages, in spirit and in matter, has similarities with the medieval architecture of France, in Europe. One is bound by religion, while the other is ruled by Confucianism. In France during the Middle Ages, the spirit of Greece evolved into the Gothic style of architecture. In our country during the Middle Ages, due to the introduction of Indian Buddhism, the Gupta style of architecture was realized, without prior arrangement. To put it another way: the Crusades and the turmoil of the Six Dynasties were all artistic revolutions and led to the success of architecture. As such, from the Middle Ages to the early modern period, religious buildings should be considered the most valuable and the greatest! During the Han and Jin dynasties, the emphasis was on reputation and pure conversation. Influenced by this legacy, the Southern and Northern Dynasties continued to study Buddhism and Taoism. Influenced by the trend of thought, the literati avoided the world and sought refuge in Buddhism. Even emperors of generations abandoned their titles and joined monasteries. For this reason, temples and pagodas, religious buildings, flourished, and were solemn, magnificent, and majestic. They were all extremely mysterious and unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>Religious culture and the spirit of the times can be clearly expressed in buildings. However, building construction is one thing, and the meaning of architecture is another. They should not be confused. For example, Xia Jie and Shang Zhou built palaces, gardens, and ponds solely for personal entertainment; Qin Shihuang built the Great Wall for national defense. Although they all initiated a style of architecture, Jie and Zhou are not worth emulating. Even Qin Shihuang, at the time, was accused of exploiting the people and wasting money, and was blamed for being a sinner for undertaking large-scale construction. Only religious buildings throughout history have not been criticized. Why is that? It can be seen that the religious buildings of our country throughout history have a broad and all-encompassing meaning. Religion and architecture are very closely related, and they are seen as natural symbols. This truly makes one wonder.</p>
<p>Cave architecture is also related to religion. The Yungang and Longmen grottoes of the Northern Wei Dynasty are the most magnificent. The Sutra Carving Cave, Shakyamuni Cave, and Great Buddha Cave of Beixiangtang, as well as the Huayan and Prajna Seven Caves of Nanxiangtang, are even more astonishing! Other examples include the Dragon Cave in Shandong during the Sui Dynasty, the Buddha niche on Yuhan Mountain, and the grottoes on Yunmen Mountain and Tuoshan Mountain; the Thousand Buddha Cliff of Shentong Temple in Licheng, Shandong, and the grottoes on Dunhuang Mingsha Mountain during the Tang Dynasty. To this day, they still stand tall and their remains can still be found.</p>
<p>Recently, during his inspection tour to the west, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek passed through Datong and was impressed by the unique and magnificent architecture of Yungang. He made a detour to visit it. The unique architecture of the Yungang Grottoes is not only rarely matched in the country, but also incomparable in the world. The Buddhist statues carved in each cave are carved out of the cliffs. They vary in size, totaling about 200,000 statues. The tallest ones are 60 to 70 feet tall, about 600 feet long. The smaller ones are only one or two inches to three or four inches. Each Buddha statue has a different shape and spirit, and is wonderfully detailed. This alone is the work of gods. Such a unique building is not only worthy of being called mysterious art. Therefore, architects and sculptors from Europe and the United States who come to China to visit this place are all tongue-tied and can hardly believe that it was made by humans. However, many Chinese people do not know the value of this ancient art, especially those who are greedy for profit and break the law, who often steal Buddha heads with tools, hoping to sell them for profit, resulting in headless stone Buddhas on the walls of thousands of Buddhas. Because of small losses, national treasures are destroyed. The crime is unforgivable. Therefore, after Chiang Kai-shek learned about this matter, he especially instructed the authorities of Jin Province to strictly prohibit and protect them, so that this great art would not be destroyed again.</p>
<h3>Things to Pay Attention to in New-Style Residential Design (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>The distance between the reception room and the kitchen has a very close relationship to the fate of the entire residence. In the past, residential designs often placed the reception room and the kitchen very close together. This design was almost universal, and at the same time, it was the most unsatisfactory. Its biggest drawback was that all the noisy sounds (such as the sounds of cleaning vegetables, cooking, etc.) and annoying mist would constantly disturb the quietness of the reception room. The flying soot and ashes would stain the white walls of your reception room. Therefore, the design of a new-style residence should make the distance between them as far as possible. It is best to separate them with a storage room for food, which can also be convenient.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of the kitchen interior design is maintaining "cleanliness." Because everything in the kitchen, such as oils, fuels, etc., can easily stain the walls and ceiling with black soot, plunging the entire kitchen into a dark world. This unclean and unsanitary design should be avoided as much as possible. A lot of ventilation can reduce the generation of smoke and ash. Walls and ceilings that are easy to paint can create a scientific "kitchen."</p>
<p>2. The Importance of Wall Isolation</p>
<p>Walls made only of bricks and mud have proven to have very bad phenomena. On the one hand, they make the walls easy to damage, and on the other hand, they make it difficult to regulate the indoor temperature, causing unpleasant feelings. The flaw in past residential buildings lies in this point.</p>
<p>A thin layer of insulation is needed in the middle of the walls of new-style buildings. This insulation is made of metal or wood. They can maintain the average indoor temperature and prevent the bricks or cement layer from expanding and contracting due to heat, thereby extending their lifespan. This is very economical. In foreign countries, dozens of types of insulation have been invented. Each type of insulation has its special application. The isolation of sound waves has made rapid progress in various countries in recent years. All of these should be considered and discussed when designing new-style residences.</p>
<p>3. The Importance of Window Direction</p>
<p>The direction of the windows affects the comfort of the entire residence. Special consideration should be given to this when designing. Houses full of sunlight tend to have "vitality" and are hygienic. North-facing windows should be avoided as much as possible. If they cannot be avoided, it is best to open windows in other directions at the same time to ensure that adequate sunlight enters to clean the indoor air (killing germs). The area of glass windows should preferably account for one-tenth of the floor area for the best results.</p>
<p>In the past, the problem of window direction in residential design was often ignored. This is a very bad phenomenon, and we should try our best to improve it.</p>
<p>4. The Choice of Building Materials</p>
<p>The choice of building materials is closely related to the economy and solidity of the entire residential building. When designing, we should choose the most economical materials that are equally strong. In this way, not only will the construction cost be reduced, but also your design will be easily successful. This kind of ingenious design is most needed in the 20th century. Heavy solid bricks have been eliminated by light hollow bricks. The quality and price of hollow bricks are lighter than the former, but they have the same supporting force. Therefore, when weighed, the construction cost is reduced a lot. The huge 19th-century stone buildings have now been replaced by lighter and stronger steel-reinforced concrete. All of these show the importance of material selection.</p>
<p>In new-style residences, the use of exposed columns should be absolutely avoided, because they can reduce the volume of the residence and also hinder the view. The use of I-beams or I-shaped beams to replace columns is the most economical, which is what architects should pay attention to.</p>
<p>In short, the reason why past residential buildings could not satisfy people was due to the adherence to old rules in design and the neglect of the most important parts. In the design of new-style residences, we should strive to improve it. (End)</p>
