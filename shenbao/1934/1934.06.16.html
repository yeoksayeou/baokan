<p>時評</p>
<h3>挽救紡紗工業之危機</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>我國工業具近代產業雛形者。首推紡織工業此爲後進工業國家之常態。亦世界進化之共同現象。然自一九二九年世界經濟發生恐慌以來。我國經濟界。外受狂潮之侵逼。内感市塲之狹小。向外輸出。旣遭關稅壁壘之阻礙。對内亦有舶來品之强烈競爭。故當業者雖曾盡力所及。將减少工作。限制出品數量等種種方法。次第施行。而卒未能稍見成效。且每况愈下。紗價上漲依然無望。貨棧堆積。仍難掃除。於是棉紗工業界整個之危機益迫。設使無切實適當之救濟辦法者。則前途將陷於與絲業同一命運矣。</p>
<p>惟吾人欲論救濟。不能不先探求紗業危機之所自來。就經濟市面整個情形論。世界任何工業。莫不顯示衰落。紡織工業如英國之闌開夏。亦異常衰頺。我國固不能例外。但其主要原因。則尙在沙塲之日見狹小也。溯自一九二九年以來。當世各國。皆傾向於自給自足之經濟政策。盡量使外國製品輸入减少。本國輸出品增加。自本國以至殖民地。莫不盡力經營我國棉製品之消塲。雖不能及於世界。然南洋各屬。猶尙有挿足餘地。乃近來一受當地市面不佳之影響。再受日本製品之强度壓迫。於是海外消塲。已等於零。而同時外國製品。復侵入我本國市塲。致使在國内亦失去優越之地位。甚且外人在我國境内投資設廠。挾其純熟之技術。利用我低廉之工資。一切地理上便利。皆與我共。而產業經營出品運輸。遂被盡占先着。此又一危機之主因也。</p>
<p>我國紗廠。以本身有低廉工資之便。就近產消之利。而竟不能與人競賽乎。蓋紗廠出品。一受政治經濟不良影響。如苛捐雜稅之繁重。如運輸費用之過巨。皆足使我國棉紗。退居於外國出品之後。在經濟市面較好時期。或可以勉强撑持。一旦外力襲來。必卽立處於困境。加以我國經營紗廠者。固多能運用近代方法。而蹈已往積習。工廠而官僚化者。恐亦有所不免。此等工廠開支浩繁。工作不力。而出品反出一般之下。在平時尙不能與强敵競爭。况在此經濟　爭激化之際乎。爲今之計。紡紗工業界。欲亟圖挽救當前之危機。自身須具徹底之覺悟。第一先謀經營合理化。革除本身之積習。第二須詳細探察内外市塲關係。圖在最短時間内。挽回已失之市塲。</p>
<p>我國本爲世界之廣大市塲。足以消納巨量之商品。我產業界綽有開發之餘地。何奈整個國民經濟。頽廢至此。大衆生活。皆處於動搖破敗之中。故無論今日欲圖經濟界暫時之小康。或爲一種產業謀出路。皆須先注視整個國民經濟之狀况如何。以定應付之策略。紗業欲在國内開拓消塲。並圖此種消塲之發展。必先謀穏定國民經濟。使一般日常必需品之消費。向上增加。則紗業自受其惠。且我國生產消費。當以最大多數之農民爲主體。能積極復興農村經濟。亦卽間接爲棉紗業闢消塲也。</p>
<h3>法西斯兩領袖　領導世界相標榜　改造歐洲當務之急　威尼斯談話守秘密　傳意允助德達到軍備均等　以德對奥問題休戰爲交換　昨上午檢閱泛繫黨軍下午砲艇會議</h3>
<p>威尼斯本日首相墨索里尼與德總揆希特勒第一次會晤、以德語談話、歷兩點二十五分之久、絶無第三人參加、彼此解釋相互政治上態度、此項談話純爲交換消息、明日兩巨頭在威尼斯海面遊覧時、將繼續談話、至晚間舉行第二次談話之後、始能得到結論、報界人士以爲德國與波蘭爲但澤問題旣能言歸於好、則奥國問題、亦未始不可和平解决云云（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>威尼斯德意兩雄今日在此會議、墨索里尼首相不事繁節、卽敏疾行動、與希特勒總理開始談判、意相敦促德總理重返日内瓦、以利完全實踐四强公約、（十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>兩揆會晤第</h3>
<p>日昨日兩狄克推多於午宴後會於璧柴尼古邸、商榷歐洲重要事務、歷兩小時半之久、室無第三人、故談話之眞正性質、不虞洩漏、此爲希特勒就總理職後第一次出國、亦爲其第一次會晤意相墨索里尼、</p>
<h3>談話内容秘不宣</h3>
<p>談話消息沉寂無所聞、故一般人士對於兩狄克推多是否商得同意一節、至爲關切、兩人似皆互相欽佩、當握手之際、歷時久而表情摯談話用德語、蓋墨氏亦精於此也、</p>
<h3>儼如古英雄凱旋</h3>
<p>昨日希特勒與墨索里尼同入威尼斯時、儼如古共和國兩英雄之凱旋、中古時代之絢爛景狀復見於今日、當希特勒由飛機降落時、墨索里尼卽向行法西斯黨式之敬禮希氏卽報以國社黨式之敬禮、兩人旋操德語寒暄數分鐘、於是卽同立小輪、沿運河入威尼斯、後隨無數小輪、如長蛇之　　而進、旣抵古城、意人見其首相、咸和熱烈歡呼、德人則集於希特勒稅駕之大旅社外、歡呼希特勒萬歲、當局曾作嚴密戒備、保護此貴賓、並置軍警以衛旅社、</p>
<h3>預定程序有變更</h3>
<p>預定之程序已稍有變更、墨索里尼未在璧柴尼邸度夜、而宿於列杜之高尙旅社、該旅社爲夏季熱鬧處所、今猶未開市也聞兩總揆昨僅交換意見、今日會晤時、或將有所决議、昨夜墨索里尼曾至大旅社答拜希特勒、兩人旋駢肩緩步而出、情殊相得、</p>
<h3>涉及奥獨立問題</h3>
<p>維也納政界消息靈通者現信希特勒關於奥國獨立問題、將多容納墨索里尼之意見、</p>
<h3>水上提燈迎貴賓</h3>
<p>昨夜大運河曾舉行水上提燈會、參加者有燈船二百艘、極一時之盛、蓋示歡迎貴賓之意焉、</p>
<h3>威尼斯戒備森嚴</h3>
<p>現入希特勒等所寓大旅社者、槪須向當道領取通行證、憑證騐放、無證者槪禁入内、威尼斯港口四周置有隠藏之砲、瞭望塔上置機關槍兩架、日夜有人守衛、其戒備之嚴、可見一斑、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法密切注視</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間政界方面現正嚴密注視希特勒與墨索里尼之會議、報紙並登載長文評論此事、並稱、此係歷史的會議云、晨報稱、墨索里尼希望消弭軍縮會議失敗後世界競爭軍備之危害、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦泰晤士報今日威尼斯訪電聲稱、意德總揆之會晤、爲人歡迎、因此事昭告世人、德國並不孤立於歐洲也、意相墨索里尼始終抱有一種信仰一以爲歐洲和平僅可以根據四國公約基本原則而作之行爲担保之、卽如遠東時局、亦因歐洲各大國不能銷釋異見、致起非必要之糾纷、一般意人仍信墨氏恢復中歐商業繁榮之計畫、乃唯一可行之辦法、且宜一面保全奥國之完整、一面予德國以其所應有之若干政治上勢力與商業上利益、衆望墨氏可勸令希特勒對奥採取友好之態度、因墨氏在軍備問題上或以新贊助給予德總理也云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國報紙對於希特勒與墨索里尼之會議、表示深切興趣、某報稱、此項會議或無不可告人之隠、談話資料當不出歐洲局勢云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>德意報紙論調　希兩國不欲簽訂任何條約　希四强合作有裨歐洲和平</h3>
<p>（柏林）今晚德國報紙載稱、希特勒總理與墨索里尼首相之會議、實非德國外交政策急轉之信號、希特勒總理今次意國之行、在外國方面不致發生政治的衡動、因並未預備在威尼斯簽訂任何正式條約也、希特勒及墨索里尼不過欲討論全部複雜之政治問題耳、如奥國問題未能解决其咎在奥、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬羅馬新聞報今日載一論文、對於德總理希特勒氏之來意、　衆　　歡迎之意、該報謂「希氏不特爲一鄰國之大賓、應予以最高之榮譽、及最熱誠之歡迎、彼實亦爲操持命運之人、彼具有不可制止之魄力、及不可動搖之信心、故能使全國之人一心皈依、而重鑄德邦、使精誠團結於國社黨旗幟之下」云、該報繼謂兩國之雄、竟擇此際爲會晤之期尤屬富有意義、蓋最近軍縮會議决議案之通過、實於歐洲之時局並無裨益、且無論何種决議若欲長久有效、維持歐洲之和平、保障歐洲之將來者、亦非有德國參加不可、此在現今已成無可疑問之事、故今日希墨二氏晤談之意義、實至重要、此後歐洲外交界之擾亂、庶可暫告平靜、德國之復返日内瓦實爲一永久之問題、非以公理與人道爲基礎甚難得一適當解决之方、惟舉世之人、能發一言以澄淸歐洲之時局促成世界之和平合作者、亦非朋尼託墨索里尼莫屬也、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬講壇報對希特勒總理表示歡迎稱、法西斯主義之意國承認德國所請求之歴史上之地位、並尊敬希特勒總理爲解放德國運動之領袖、希特勒完成之解放、卽爲歐洲再造之一部、僅此種改造已足使歐洲恢復其指導世界之精神、而此種精神亦卽墨索里尼所標榜者、反對墨索里尼與希特勒者、必須從此點觀察二人之會議、歐洲當務之急、在各國能有穏固及負責之政府、始能應付吾人之難題、意大利日報載稱、希特勒與墨索里尼之會議、係和平及廓淸紛亂之權力的表現、歐洲時局現甚困難且危機四伏、如軍縮之失敗、軍縮競爭之復活、集團政治之崛起、及希望壓迫極端派以延長經濟恐慌等等、故安定爲不可能之事、墨索里尼反對集團政治、而忠於四强公約之合作辦法、四强和平公約者、歐洲秩序與和平之理想基石也云、（十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>英國對日貿易戰爭　（倫敦通信）　不能再忍受日貨壓迫　必須即固定英國市場</h3>
<p>英日兩國之間、近來經濟的對立、越見嚴重、在英國必須保持他旣得利益、尤須維繫其在自治領殖民地上之經濟的優越地位、而日本方面、也不肯輕於表示讓步、隨便就退出英國的勢力範圍、何况退出之後、並沒有適當的代替塲所、因此英日間爲了調和這種貿易上的對立關係、曾由民間選出代表、在當地開過會議、終於因爲輸出數量與市塲的區劃得不到一致之點、到底還是破裂了、自那一會議破裂以後、日本更加推進他的對英輸出、英國則祇有從事於防守、還有一種英國很自危的事是、英國雖屬於帝國主義的先進國家但紡紗工業、還是占工業中很重要的地位、而一九三一年到一九三三年、這三年當中、英國的紡紗錠子竟减少了六百九十八萬一千錠、反之在日本方面、則增加了一百四十五萬錠、彼此相形之下、英國是何等的憤恚、所以商務總長倫西曼發表了一道聲明書其大意如下、</p>
<p>「英國政府之於日本商品競爭問題、促起日本政府之注意者、已二年於茲矣、在此期間、日本貨品之輸出、乃愈見增加、於是英國政府、遂不能不作到貿易自衛之結論、然本身並不以爲二十年來之通商關係條約有破棄之必要、惟英國市塲、政府以爲絹絲關稅問題不能再行延期、故財長命令關稅諮詢委員會應趕速完成其報告、並要求　亞非利加以外之殖民地及保護領士之當局、實施適當之限額制度、此種限額制度、卽由外國輸入棉製品及人造絲製品之限額是也、其數目當以一九　七年至一九三一年之平均輸入額數爲凖、各殖民地政府應卽制定此種必須之法律、該項法律預計輸入須以不妨害限額制之實施爲原則、並可卽日（五月七日）發生效力、西非殖民地以英日條約妨碍英國製品之特惠、故已於去年五月十六日通告撤消該約、此後將講求限制日本製品之方法、余之爲此申明殆、不欲涉及棉製品及人造絲製品以外問題、而政府則以爲與日本競爭、當不僅限於棉製品與人造絲也、故於其他商品在殖民地市塲上正考慮應施行何種關稅政策、至於英國本國以上述關稅法爲一種普通方法之對策、我政府對此問題、無論日本提出任何提案、設爲互相恊定之解决、（英國）固有意加以深切之考慮與注意也、</p>
<p>這個申明、無異於商業上的對日「哀的美敦書」、英國還是堅决的主張是一九二八年到一九三一年的日本輸出平均數爲基凖、我們試略考查這五年的數字、日本對印度棉布輸出、這四年平均爲四三六·八六九千平方碼、對海峽殖民地輸出棉布爲三二·八一八千平方碼、對埃及輸出棉布爲九九·四五四千平方碼、對澳洲爲一五·二八五千平方碼、及至一九三三年、印度則增加至於四五一·八○三千平方碼、海峽殖民地增至九五·七六九十平方碼、埃及增加二一·三五一千平方碼、澳州增加五四·九九七千平方碼、其他英屬各地除香港而外類皆爲日本棉製品所壟斷、英國以統治者資格、反而退居於被動地位、在這時候、當然不能不亟圖反攻了、在各自治領方面、現在誠然還沒有明白表示態度、但是澳洲依舊懷着恐日病、加拿大更是戒備森嚴、印度埃及也是有交換條件纔對日較好、（例如要日本購買印度棉花）其餘多半以英國本國的意旨爲轉移、總之英日間的經濟關係對立的程度是越見深刻了、（五月九日）</p>

<h3>桂省經濟調查印象記（續）</h3>
<p>— 千家駒</p>
<p>賓陽是廣西的一個手工藝區、又是出產瓷器最著名的地方，因爲這地方主人多地少，居民都從事一種手工藝，以維持生活，且人民富於模倣性，故又有」小東洋「之稱，他們會模倣各式各樣的小玩藝，如氈　喼帽·銅鐵器·帳鈎·兒童玩具，甚至會倣造駁殼槍，往往有一個村莊，這村莊的居民整個兒都從事一種手工業，這種手工業亦就成爲這村莊的特產品，例如方村的人織燈心帶，石坎村的人做紙扇紙被，粟村的人製日用小鐵器，王謝村做泥箕燈繩，大莊村的人做雨帽，孟村做蓆子，石村做碓子，上寨村做梳箆，羅村製筆，東路蒙村織手袖，楊村做喼帽，東海村做牙刷······他們終年都從事這一種工作，做好了的東西就挑到墟上去賣，賓陽有一個蘆墟，是廣西四大墟塲之一，三日一市，不惟是該縣出入口貨的集散地，而同時也還是賓陽鄰屬各縣商品貿易的總匯，在墟的一天，這些手工業者無論做帽的做雨傘的，銅鐵器的······都停止了工作，一早起來就挑着担來到蘆墟，蘆墟是離城十里的一個鎭，這一天的熱鬧緊張，逈異尋常，眞是萬頭鑽動，人聲沸騰，宛如北平舊曆年的廠廟一樣要到了下午四五點鐘，人才慢慢散去，過了這墟期，蘆墟就變得像死城一樣，店門虚掩，生意蕭索，又像我們内地家家閉户過新年那種氣象了，在這裏，我們不惟可以看出廣西的商業還停留在集市制度上，而且，手工業者同時還兼遊行商販，這種封建經濟的組織是爲在大都市住慣了的我們所意想不到的，</p>
<p>賓陽瓷器之在廣西有如景德鎭瓷器之在江西一樣，雖然景德瓷器有國内市場，而賓陽瓷器却祇不過有一部份的省内市塲而已，賓陽瓷器的發現，據說已有八十多年的歷史，最初發源於老窰村，其時僅製無釉之瓦器，後有江西人從軍雲貴，道經賓陽，資斧斷絶，輾轉至老窑村工作，二三年間卽發現白釉石，始研究掛粗糙的釉，後來淥思（村名）江族派人到江西醴陵等處，考察製法，研究顏料，近年又經當局的提倡，製造方法遂大有改進，到了前年七月，建設廳特聘請技士，開始調查及試騐該地瓷質，結果他們發現這裏的坭質次於江西而優於上海，但因所用方法過於拙劣，於是撥銀四百元以資獎勵，本地窑户這時也頗具熱心，集資共二千元，後又向建設廳借洋四千元，遂成立新瓷器廠，現該廠歸工商局辦理，他們所出的瓷器，比土法的便優良多了，這種瓷器是完全仿照江西瓷而改良的，雖然還不及江西出產的那麽精細，然而與土瓷相比，是有天壤之别的，不過現在他們的產品還不多，市塲上尙無售買者，據廣西當局的意見，他們改良賓陽瓷器的目的，並不想與江西瓷或舶來品到省外市塲去競爭，他們祇是希望賓陽改良瓷器將來能奪取江西瓷廣東瓷在省内市塲的位置，因爲丨直到現在爲止，賓陽土瓷器僅能銷至西江上游邊僻的縣份，自貴縣的下游，以及南寗·柳州·桂林·鬱林······等地，市塲上莫不充塞着湖南瓷與江西瓷，所以如把賓陽瓷提倡起來，則桂省的一部份漏　也可以抵制了，</p>
<p>除新瓷器廠外，賓陽大槪有三百多窰户，二十多個窰，每年生產瓷器的總値約達十五六萬元，他們往往是幾家合用一個窰，每窰九節，頭尾兩節燒空，還有七節可以裝東西，故每窰少者七八户，多者十三四户，這種窰往往是他們的祖上遺傳下來唯一的生產工具，</p>

<h3>甜夢中暴徒突至</h3>
<p>徐州人董道芳、年四十歲、向在紗廠作工爲生、妻王氏、年三十四歲亦在紗廠織布間織布、夫婦兩人同寓於榮慶里五十六號前樓、昨日淸早五時十分許、夫婦同床正在酣睡之際、樓下二房東適啓門、倒洗便桶、兩暴徒突疾馳而來、直闖上樓、破門而入、夫婦均從萝中驚醒、</p>
<h3>力不敵雙斧齊下</h3>
<p>董夫婦瞥見兩人各持利斧、知來尋釁、遂一躍而起、正擬詰問、詎已雙斧齊下、奮力猛砍、董雖竭力抵抗、奈因一不敵二、氏先受傷倒地、董見氏已傷倒、猶負傷與兩暴徒揪扭至樓下客堂中、究因力乏、卒被砍斷後頸暈倒、兩凶手見目的已達、遂疾馳而逸、當由隣居立卽電知海格路紅十字會醫院、派救護車趕至、將董與氏車回院中、</p>
<h3>樓上下血流遍地</h3>
<p>該管六區譚區長得報、立派程巡官及偵緝隊正領班巫克忠、副領班董文瑞、偵緝員楊淸、吳以和等馳往、查得該前樓上下血流遍地、並向二房東詢問一過、復至醫院、見董之頭面有刀傷五六處、後頸骨已被砍斷、手臂肩背亦受傷五六處、業已氣絶斃命、而王氏面旁肉砍落一塊、頭頸手胸等約有七八處、神志昏迷、奄奄一息、亦在十分垂危之間、兩人共受傷二十三處、</p>
<h3>兇手係兄弟兩人</h3>
<p>後經巫董兩領班從事偵詢、查悉兇手係住居同里一百三十一號亭子間内之山東流氓霍瑞亭、霍瑞蘭兄弟兩人、其原因爲霍瑞亭之妻陳氏、與董妻王氏同廠作工、素所認識、本月五日曹家渡出會、兩氏同出觀看後、陳氏忽然失踪無着、霍卽四處找尋、迄無影跡、迭向董及王氏交涉、誣董謀害、故下此辣手、以圖報復云云、旋由譚區長飭令各偵緝員及所屬官警、一體上緊嚴緝該兩兇手拘案懲辦、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀文學書的興趣　丨丨答顧念椿，李行魚二君丨丨</h3>
<p>在未說到正文以前、我想先向讀者們談一點别的事。一年前我到某内地一個中學敎國文，剛到時，那位介紹我去的朋友（也是敎國之的）特意向我說、「這裏學生的頭腦是很舊的，大多數還要讀古文，所以用的課本，也是某書店出版的古文選本。」我問他這是什麽原因，他回答，「白話文他們自已一看就懂感不到什麽興趣，古文則不然······」我當時沒有表示意見，但總感到他的話並不盡然，所謂興趣，决不是生成的，不可轉移的東西，而且當敎師的也不應該遷就學生的興趣，而牽他們陷入泥坑。於是，我一方面向學校當局交涉，我敎授的幾班國文，不用課本，由我編講義；另一方面，我自已擬了一個計劃，先選一些五四時代「及古文的文章，再選幾篇文學論文，附帶幾篇純文藝作品，其用意，在於先打破他們迷信古文的成見，然後使他們懂得文學的眞實意義在那裏。果然，我的計劃見效了。在最初的幾個星期，確有些人反對，要求選讀古文，但後來這種情形，眼見逐漸減少；不至半年，連那敎古文的老敎師，反而被學生趕走，造成了學校内的一種新文藝的空氣。</p>
<p>試拿这段事實來解釋顧李二君讀書的興趣的問題，是非常容易得到答案的。</p>
<p>顧君說，丨丨讀了幾本文藝書覺得枯燥無味，及把讀書的興趣打斷了。</p>
<p>李君說，丨丨愛讀　公予且的小說，而不愛讀魯迅茅眉的小說。</p>
<p>顯明的，兩君之癥結所在，由於不知怎樣從文藝書中領受到興趣，或者由於感受力的薄弱。而决定點則在他們的生活和他們對於文藝的素養。</p>
<p>鄕下人看到城裏的學生踢皮球，是認爲最無聊不過的事，卽他偶然因爲好奇而去踢一兩脚，甚至要弄得腿痛腰酸，但在一般好運動的學生看來，打球是比什麽都有味的玩意兒了，這是什麽原因呢？這並非關於某一個人的特性，是因爲他們不同的日常生活，才養成了他們不同的興趣。當然，也有人對於和他的特殊生活相反的事件發生興趣的。譬如，書香人家的子弟，往往不願讀書而喜歡胡調，深居高樓大厦的人，偏偏喜歡去游中玩水，這是常有的現象，然而，仍祇能拿他們的生活去說明，這些興趣的發生，是他們生活的反響，不滿或疲倦於自已的生活，才對　　　　　主興趣的。</p>
<p>其次，在　生活的情　　　　　事於某件事體，各人的興趣仍有不同，這完全是因爲他們對於某件事體所理解的程度有差别。一個初上學的孩子，常常要賴學，但有許多學者，甚至可以不吃飯，都不能呌他不看書。關於這也許有人要懐疑·人爲什麽又會「喜新厭舊」呢？」我可以回答，這是人類的好奇心。由好奇可以引人興趣，然而好奇却與興趣無關。老先生進舞塲看跳舞，是完全由於好奇心，倘因此而說他對於跳舞有興趣，那便是寃枉。對一個剛識「之無」的人，大談其文章眞諦，自然要發生對牛彈琴之感；如果只有負担五十斤重量的氣力，而要使負起百斤重担，那更是只有逼人走上死路了。</p>
<p>山於上面的說明，可見，顧李二君讀文學書不能引起興趣，决不是値得驚奇的事，而實有其各自的原因；由於作者的經騐，（如上述的事實，）要解决這問題丨提高自已對於讀文學書的興趣，一方面是要使自已的生活與文學更接近另一方面，决不要想「一步登天」而要學那，按步就班，」引人入勝的步法，當然，這也並不是很容易的事。（未完）</p>

<h3>中華兒敎社　考察日本記（九）周尙</h3>
<p>一、國家學校爲國家之理想而培養其基礎、</p>
<p>二、社會學校鑑社會之要求而啕冶其實際、</p>
<p>三、兒童學校導兒童之生活而恊助其向上、</p>
<p>又覩該校之三大特質、一·鍜鍊體格重視職業指導二·從事校外指導充實休閒生活、三·聯絡職業指導上之後援機關、</p>
<p>該校視職業指導爲立於國家·社會·兒童三者之契合點且係敎育之必然要求非僅爲時外部粉飾時髦品而已也、舉凡遊戲生活·閑暇生活在在須以職業指導爲核心、蓋職業指導爲全敎育之成果、因之、眞正之敎育有待於般陶冶及職業指導兩者合理的結合與表現、是以職業指導常關聯於整個敎育舉其比較的顯著者如下、</p>
<p>（一）職業陶冶欲使兒童獲得職業之理解職業之實技實能則兒童對職業之精神態度、不能不先應樹立、一·學習指導·訓練施設體育養護各項之特殊施敎、二·各科之鄕土化·實　化·作業化、三·同窗講座·職業講話·標本蒐集四·校内接待賓客並通電話、自由車販賣練習·各科指導之連絡統一、五·勤勞服務·假設就職職業參加等、</p>
<p>（二）選職指導選職人盡其用爲目標、一面督兒童努力精進、俾順應職業而養成適應個性適應環境爲目標、一·各種性能檢查與全體之觀察、二·兒童自已之省察與職業之希望、三·境遇之省察與父兄之希望四·選職上之個别指導與聯絡父兄會、五·求人推荐及其調查、六·就職斡旋及假想就職、</p>
<p>（三）就職後之輔導就職後學校·本人·社會間之聯絡、常留意輔導、一·通信·訪問·召集指導二·受職輔導部之特設、三·　人會·愛職·同窗會雜誌、</p>
<p>以上所述、皆該校之主張、有一部份有採納之價値參觀旣畢、招待吾人入禮堂欵以茶點、放映學校生活電影、先開映起居生活、如校舍、朝會·休息·吹軍號·早操·行禮·各種運動、次映科學生活訓練、如顯微鏡下研究、實騐室工作、工廠工作、畜養情形、園藝種植、繼映商業實習如匯兌·數票·打字·販賣技術、博覧會出品等、旋復映閑暇生活、如旅行、烹飪等、國家精神、如祭祀楠公英雄等社會生活如登舟參觀等、畢業生生活如小烏之離巢各處服務情形等等、</p>
<p>統觀全校精神無往而非集注於職業敎育、據該校長稱歷年畢業生百之九十、皆有職業、今歲三月底千餘人畢業、大半業已就職、其中計小店員三○五人、實習生三四○人、升學三一人、其他六四人、就業各生中由學校介紹者三七三人、家庭介紹者一三三人、其他介紹者二一○人、日本現感就職難」、據最近調查報告、全國有業者二千九百餘萬、無業者三千四百餘萬、有業者祇百分之四五點六、男佔百分之五九點一、女百分之三一點九、該校畢業生易謀位置、要非平日訓練得宜、安能有此功績、</p>
<p>日本今日敎育之立脚點爲勞働訓練軍國民敎育係其舊有基礎、職業敎育、已臻前進之目標矣、預料工廠化之學校、多角之職業敎育實施行、外强中乾之日本、不二十年、或可與美國並駕齊驅也、彼邦之手工科數十年來依然爲手工科、不若吾國之手工科一變爲工藝、再變爲勞作等新名詞、察其結果、視他人仍望塵莫及、現日本可稱人人皆受敎育、（最近統計千人中祇二人未受敎育）故其販夫走卒亦咸識字區區女僕至少亦有六年小學畢業資格、</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>一到夏季，照例就得穿紗的衣服；那末我們可是眞穿紗的衣服嗎？不錯，我們是眞穿紗的衣服！祇是在紗的底下特地做一重綢的夾裹，中間還塞一些棉花。這樣，我們一方面旣可免除違反法令之罪，一方面又不致受凍了。不過這種辦法也不是一種新發明，也不是一種秘密，乃是一個公開的折衷辦法；也許在當初制定這些四季不同的衣服之後，不多幾時，就有人想出這個辦法來了。便是太后自已，也往往照此辦理。但是因爲伊的地位旣是這樣的高貴，穿的衣服當然總得比人家特出些，所以我們儘管用棉花，伊却必須用絲棉。絲棉是一種蠶吐的亂絲，溫度比棉花高，重量比棉花輕，又是宮中一般養蠶女專誠給伊備就的，當然應由伊享用了。</p>
<p>一到四月，就是春季的開始，宮中所有的女官，就得一齊挿戴起珠寳的飾物來了。舉凡壓髮針，耳環，指環之類，不是珠串的，便是玉鑲的，不是翡翠，便是瑪瑙，每一個人都是打扮得珠光寳氣，目爲之眩。</p>
<p>讀者看了上面這幾段簡單的叙述，便不難想見當日在滿淸皇帝統治下的中國，無論官民的服裝，都是何等的整齊一律；雖然他們的政治是那樣的腐敗，但對於外表的衣飾，倒是的確很注意的，現在讓我再講一些女人的服式。當然女人是更考究了，根本因爲女人是都愛打扮的，又是都愛趨時的；卽無法令規定，伊們也一定會自動的變出花樣來。所以一到冬天，他們所有的服裝上便齊有臘梅花點綴着了。（五九）</p>
<h3>飛人的研究</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>這在西方神話史上，飛行的小仙人，身體碩狀，如五六個月的小孩，手執弓箭，有欲射的形象。又有愛普塵羅的飛行，無影無形。手中執有一長矛，在美女身上，任何部分刺了一下。在伊目光初啓時，所有見的第一人，生生死死跟着，不肯一步相離。</p>
<p>中國小說上，王莽在神山上，聘來了一位巨人，身高十丈，背生雙翼，能飛行數百里，取大將首級，如探囊取物。昆陽之戰，巨無覇幾次飛起，都被雷雨將他打落下地。最後一次，拚命起飛。剛到了劉秀頭上，一聲霹靂，劉秀無羔，巨無霸戰死，所以後史名呌風雨戰昆陽就在這一聲雷。</p>
<p>徽欽在金兵圍城時，曾有一隊六甲神兵，能够飛起三丈。雖不是妖言，惑衆，終於無救國事。徽欽被掠，神兵解散。說岳傳中，又載牛臯打碎了御賜犒軍酒。車夫吃了一杯，便七竅流血而死。牛臯一怒打碎了，並沒有一滴留存。雖有說功，實在太魯莽了。被逐出營，無路可走，逢着了一位神仙，傳他穿雲箭，波浪履，奪命丹。這在大破場公時，穿雲箭射下一片席雲，捉到了一名飛名的妖人。波浪履捉了楊公。奪命丹救了岳飛性命。</p>
<p>難道眞有人會飛行嗎？某報曾經在紀念刋物上，畫有一位美貌女郎，駕著足蹈飛行器，在半空中散報。</p>
<p>美術生活第在期，有六幅飛人的照片，將肺中炭酸氣吹入廻轉飛行器中，便能起飛了。升空前的一瞬，高飛至離地面十二米突，萬轉的仰觀，下降的情形，安全著陸後對一記者，講述他飛行騐試；「這四十秒的飛行，眞像作夢一般。」</p>

<p>指頭畫，創自何時，殊不可考。昔曾般師及始皇侍者，嘗以足指畫水神；，以此推擬，周秦之世，當亦有以指頭畫者。小山論畫云：「唐張璪卽以手畫，畢宏見而異之！或問所授，曰：外師造化，中得心源，」云云。知唐時指畫固亦有之，淸高且園亦工指畫，名「指頭生活；」人物，山水，禽魚，無不生動！遼東高秉嘗著指頭畫說云：「恪勤公八齡學畫，遇稿輒撫，積十餘年，盈二簏；弱冠卽恨不能自成一家！倦而假寐，夢一老人引至土室，四壁皆畫，理法無不具備，而室中空空，不能撫仿；惟水一孟，爰以指醮而習之；覺乃大喜！奈得於心而不能應之於筆，輒復悶悶；偶憶土室中用水之法，因以指蘸墨，仿其大略，盡得其神；信手拈來，頭頭是道；職此，遂廢筆焉。······」是豈眞由神授哉！乃因臨畫十餘年，工夫已深，忽有所悟，便能隨意揮灑，與所謂「中得心源」者，同一心理。於是指頭畫遂卓然在我國畫壇占一格，賢士大夫，多戲爲之。</p>
<p>晚照樓主閻甘園先生，關中耆宿，精鑒别，富收藏，善書能畫；書精各體，蒼勁古茂，譽滿天下：畫以指頭生活爲多，山水，人物，仕女，花木，魚龍，烏獸，一經指點，無不氣韻生動；而一種蒼厚雄深之致，尤非毛頴所能及！殆先生生長河岳之間，外師造化易得江山之助；抑亦篤於好古，陶養旣深，得心應手，有如是者。夫張璪手筆，余未曾見，不敢妄加比擬！若以視甘園所作，則今人固遠勝古人也。先生今年七十，精神矍鑠，如四五十許人；近作指頭書畫凡數百幅，將於月之十五，十六，十七，三日；在寗波同鄕會供衆展覧。世之讀先生畫者，得無如畢宏之見張璪耶。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十回　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城</p>
<p>我們中華民國的好漢，從前都征東征西過了的。於今我們是對着外國人，都很客氣的，他要這樣的對待咱們，咱們受得了這口氣嗎。在這個時候沒有别的話說，就是要我們的命可以，一寸土地不讓人家拿去。好比說，你住在家裏，並沒有什麽事得罪人，人家可打進你家裏來了，你能說一點也不動手，坐在這裏讓人家揍嗎？是好種都來罷。我們同來把這大門關住，可不能讓敵人胡亂闖進來。幹罷，弟兄們。自强說畢，兩手舉起鋤了來，又在土壕裏挖了起來。有了他這一番興奮的動作，這才把各位弟兄那種怠惰的趨勢，給他們從事復興起來。自强心裏想着，怪不得我們寳營長爲人十分忠勇，原來是有原故的。一個作頒袖的人，一舉一動，都與全體同事有關的，不能不處處留心的了。一個當軍人的，必須要學我們營長。自强爲了這樣一轉念，他本是在戰壕上監工的，現在且不監工，也親自跟着弟兄，在一處來挖土。可是這種工作，不是平常的一種挖壕工作。在口外，天氣比關裏要早冷兩個月，而且是要冷上幾倍。這個時候，已經下過好幾塲雪，雪下來了，决不會溶化，滿山滿谷，都是銀子裝成的。地上的雪，雖不向下滲透，可是地面上的寒氣，却一直降到土裏去幾尺深，於是土裏一些潮濕，受了冷氣，將地皮凍得成了鐵板一樣。若是將鋤子鋤了下去，那地皮能够把鋤子濺了回來。所幸寳芳事先已經明白了這層困難，預已挖了兩道壕，於今不過是再加一道而已。（四一○）</p>

<h3>端陽的藝術化</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>歲時佳節，是民衆娛樂的日子。在天下太平的時候，物阜民殷，佳節良辰，當然有不少的民衆娛樂來點綴，不能說是勞民傷財的事情。而且，在佳節時所有的娛樂，並不是毫無意識的，不過沿習已久，慢慢地失却當初的本意吧了。單把端陽節來講，吃的方面；角黍啦，枇杷啦，靑梅啦，鰣魚啦，應時的鮮菓佳饌，不勝枚舉。娛樂主面：龍舟竸渡啦，懸掛鍾馗啦，繡製香囊啦，蒲劍艾虎啦，形形色色，很有藝術的意味，不單是歷史上有悠久的價値吧了。節届天中，風和日暖，花開草長，趁這炎暑還未到臨的當兒，談談端陽的故事，豈不是一件爽心樂事嗎？</p>
<p>（一）鍾馗相傳唐明皇病瘧，晝夢一大鬼，破帽，藍袍，角帶，朝靴，捉小鬼吃了，自稱終南進士鍾馗，曾經應舉，不中，觸階而死。明皇夢醒病愈，便詔吳道子畫了鍾馗的像。後來民間以端陽以後，天氣漸熱，疫病將至，以爲是有鬼魅作崇。便在端陽這天，繪了一幅鍾馗，掛在廳堂，以爲可以嚇退魔鬼了。其實，鍾馗便是考工記裏的終葵，是椎的别名，古人以椎逐鬼，馬融廣成頌的揮終葵揚玉斧，便是明證。不知怎樣一來，明皇想出一個破帽藍袍角帶朝靴的一位鍾進士來，請吳道子繪畫。吳道子是有名的畫師，畫這鍾鬼怪，尤其是擅長的，當然寫得非常好了。鍾馗是醜的，他的妹子是美麗的，醜美畫在一起，醜的也變成美的。所以　人又畫了鍾馗嫁妹圖，却是非常好看了。端陽之畫鍾馗，不是一個藝術化麽？</p>
<p>（二）競渡梁宗懍荆楚歲時記說：「屈原以五月五日投汨羅，故武陵以此日作競渡以招之。」在端午這天，俗有龍舟競渡之舉，與其說是紀念屈原，不如說是提倡水中運動。因爲湘贛浙吳鄂諸省，江河交差，民衆習於水嬉，端午又是天氣和暄的節季，最宜於提倡水中運動，鼓勵尙武精神，大槪這競渡一回事，吳王夫差，越王勾踐，已經來提倡了。後人踵事增華，把龍舟造得華麗精美，鼓樂喧天，鷁首盡發，古人練習水戰的遺意，也變做藝術化了。</p>
<p>（三）蒲劍相傳五月五日有殺韃子之說，因爲韃子視我們漢人如奴隸，强姦婦女，無所不爲。咱們漢人恨極了，約定在五月五日門上，家家門上掛蒲艾爲號，大家起來殺完韃子。這個傳說，雖然不甚可靠，可是掛蒲劍這事，至今還是盛行的，其中必有一件故實了。大槪金元蹂躪中國，散處各地，依仗自已强盛，必有侵佔民田，姦淫擄掠等事，睚眦必報，殺之始快，掛蒲劍，殺韃子，未必無這件事呢。人心未死，覇道難久，咱們中國人難道忘記了古人的意思麽？</p>

<h3>新樂器</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>利用眞空管低週率振盪器製成的樂器，種類很多，本篇所介紹的一種，原名Ｔｒａｕｔｏｎｉｕｍ，是德國Ｔｒａｕｔｗｅｉ博士所設計的。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>第一圖爲常用之眞空管低週率振盪器，振盪時，其週率之多寡，隨栅路内的電阻及電容量而變。因爲要擴大變動週率的範圍起見，所以電容器有電阻，都採用較大的數値。使用時，先旋轉開關ＳＷ以定音量之大小，或使與其他樂器相諧振，次以手指按捺銅絲，卽得高低不同的音階。（各種音階一定之地位，則須俟試騐後，纔能决定。）</p>
<p>本器構造十分簡單，雖對於無綫電毫無研究的人，也不難按圖試騐。製成後，如無振盪產生，可調換低週率變壓器，初級綫圈（次級綫圈亦可）之兩綫頭，倘再無效，卽係眞空管内部有損，須施以復活法或更換新管。</p>
<h3>第二圖</h3>
<p>再，據實騐所得，以使用三極眞空管效力爲最大，至於種類則不論交流直流眞空管均可。</p>
<p>本器所需之材料及其數値，有如左述：</p>
<p>ＣＩ＝Ｉｍｆ·Ｔ＝低週率變壓器</p>
<p>Ｃ２＝·５ｍｆ·Ｖ＝３ｏ眞空管</p>
<p>Ｃ３＝·２５ｍｆ·Ｒ＝２ｏ歐姆可變燈絲調節器</p>
<p>Ｃ４＝·Ｉｍｆ·ＲＩ＝五節綫繞式固定電阻</p>
<p>Ｃ５＝ｏ５ｍｆ·每節十萬歐姆（見第二圖）</p>
<p>Ｃ６＝·ｏ２５ｍｆ·</p>
<p>Ｃ７＝·ｏＩ５ｍｆ·</p>
<p>Ｃ８＝·ｏＩｍ·</p>
<p>Ｃ９＝·ｏｏ５ｍｆ·</p>
<p>ＣＩｏ＝·ｏｏｒｍｆ·</p>
<p>ＣＩＩ＝·ｏｏｏ６Ｉｍｆ·</p>
<p>ＣＩ２＝·ｏｏｏ２５ｍｆ·</p>
<h3>簡單的交流電壓控制器</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>在都市中的電燈電源，常因用户用電量的不同，日夜間的電壓時有變動，電壓的變動，對於收音機的收音甚有影響的；且電壓過高，足致眞空管斷絲，或屏流過大而損壞，故應當予以控制，以防萬一，現萬一，現介紹一種最簡單而經濟的交流電壓控制器，發法簡單，喜弄無綫電的同志，皆能自製，請視附圖，在一只膠木管上密繞十六號雙紗包綫四十圈，（綫圈上若塗一層漆質，以增加絶性緣則更佳）二綫頭一端接於變壓器，一端接於電源，再用尺寸適當的軟鐵桿一根，或以長螺絲帽釘代替亦可，挿入膠木管中，如遇外來電壓降落時，將鐵桿抽去；若遇外來電壓升高時，將鐵桿挿入，使這簡單的裝置，完成阻流圈的工作，綫圈的多少，不一定拘於四十圈，以視當地的電壓變動如何而定；或較少於四十圈，或較多於四十圈，或接中分綫頭亦可。總之，以調節適當的電壓，使電源變壓器的副圈電壓常保持規定値，則收音機的收音感着滿意，而眞空管亦不致損傷。</p>
<h3>失眞</h3>
<p>— 吳善長</p>
<p>除開高樓大厦中特别設計的收音機外，業餘愛好者自已做的收音機、失眞（Ｄｉｓｔｏｒｔｉｏｎ）是很普遍的現象，這種現象報務員是不必注意的，但業餘者要改善其音質時，非注意不可</p>
<p>那麽我們先問：收音機是否穏定？有高週波擴大級的，當轉到一電台，是否有振盪的傾向？這種不悅耳高音調的「噝噝」之聲，使音樂要變嘘嘯而急。</p>
<p>修改的方法是改造高週波擴大級，或加以隔離罩，但祇要重新排列另件佈置，如綫圈角度及主要接綫等，也就行了。高放的不穏定，祇不過佈置及地位設計上的問題，並不是由於特别狀態。</p>
<p>在高放級若綫圈及電容器已用隔離罩而仍不穏定，那是沒有的。</p>
<p>失眞在低放方面比高放方面多。</p>
<p>用兩級低週波擴大，或末級用五極强力管（Ｐｅｎｔｏｄｅ）爲輸出，那麽最好用電阻交連。</p>
<p>眞空管過荷，也有引起失眞的可能，乙電壓不正確，也是一種原因。</p>
<p>每種眞空管必定有它正確的屏電壓及栅電壓，故仿單上指定的，必須注意之，一定之乙電壓應用一定之丙電壓旣省屏電，音又淸爽。</p>
<p>眞空管乙電壓已足，丙電能否工作，亦須注意，普通丙電，能支持到六到八個月，（指外國電池而言，國貨比較上不能用到如此久）否則應用電表量後再用。</p>
<p>，輸出過響，也能引起失眞，因此只有减低它的音量，或用輸出力較大之眞空管。換句話說，就是用强力管來代替，這類眞空管所用丙電値較在，因之屏電流亦因之增大。</p>
<p>有許多業餘者有喜用高比率變壓器的傾向，這種希望有時要受打擊的，因擴大效能有一定限度，方始不失眞而穏定，故用兩級變壓器交連的低放其比率用得低一點好。</p>
<p>用兩隻變壓器交連的低放，將變壓器之鐵心通地，接綫之地位，距離要適當，可預防不穏定。</p>
<p>劣質變壓器，週波特性亦劣，往往引起失眞，所以便宜貨以少用爲上策。</p>
<p>至於用三回路再生式之收音機，或再生力過大，乙電壓過高，亦易引起失眞，那時祇要乙電壓减低些，或把再生力减小些，就可防制之。</p>
<p>業餘者能注意上述數點，失眞之弊，當能免除。</p>
<h3>獲得以太</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>無線電波在空中傳怖進行，自必有據藉的媒介物質，此種媒介物在無線電學上，假定名之爲「以太」（Ｅｔｈｅｒ）但所謂以太者，完全爲虚空假設之名詞，其形體如何，性質如何，更無從解答，卽究竟存在與否亦尙屬疑問，無數大科學家，不知絞盡幾許腦計，作過幾千萬次的實騐，欲證明此以太之存在，以及表現其特性，但終歸失敗。</p>
<p>最近捷克斯拉夫京城柏拉格（Ｄｒａｇｕｅ）大學的敎授普斯傑潑（Ｖａｃｉａｖｐｏｓｊｐａ）自信已獲得以太瞬息的現影，他設想以太必爲含有大羣的原子微粒，類如氧原子的中心核，但並無電荷，彼曾以鋼（金屬原素之一）製之細線，置於眞空極完全的管中，設法使之加熱，並在未熱之前及已熱之後，均可測得其電阻。實騐的結果，發現管内的氧核分散，而聚集於鈀線上，普斯傑潑敎授深信儲藏的此項微粒，卽爲以太。巴黎大學敎授可登（ＡｉｍｅＣｏｔｔｏｎ）亦謂以太可在眞空中，分散水的分子而獲得云。</p>

<h3>懷中交流收音機</h3>
<p>— 王彩文</p>
<p>這種所說的懷中收音機，並不是小得可以藏入懷中的，不過牠的大小可以說比從前的任何小型的收音機小得多。</p>
<p>當我開始設計個收音機時，其目標在於盡量縮小，而於效率方面竟無暇計及，但結果却出乎意外的優美，故特介紹於此。</p>
<p>因爲這個收音機，目的在乎小，所以眞空管都用最新式的。其次的變量電容器，若用普通的則被占地位很多，所以用新式的變量電容器，這個新式的變量電容器，容量○、○○○三三、厚只有十五衯公尺，寛六十三衯公尺，比從前的小得多。</p>
<p>枝路電容器是用８ｕｆ的電解式，濾波器中所用的低周率阻流圈是沒有使用，而另用一德國式的耗阻。檢波是用五七號工式管，這在低壓，用來做栅檢波，則其效率非常好，所消費的電流又小量　　茲將全機所使用另件列舉於下，</p>

<p>Ｖ３ＫＸ１２Ｂ</p>
<p>如用二二七Ｂ代Ｖ２的二七Ａ·雖效率比較好，但其形稍大，所以有時候不便使用。</p>
<p>調整及感度</p>
<p>一看這個綫路圈，所感覺到不安的事情，就是交流音的問題，因爲Ｃ６及Ｃ８是大容量，而Ｒ６Ｒ７的數値過大，所以由於波漣（Ｒｉｐｐｌｅ）所發生的交流音不成問題，非注意不可的，就是由於誘導所發生的交流音，最初實騐時覺得很煩惱，當聲筒掛在耳朶時哦哦音聲發生得不得了，後來種種改變，這個雜音好容易纔屏除了。</p>
<p>感度是頗良，像這樣的極小的收音機，能聽得到這樣的明瞭，牠的成績實在是很可驚，讀者諸君不妨一試。</p>

<h3>紗花　現銷寥寥紗花續疲</h3>
<p>紗市仍疲、因外棉趨跌、現紗銷路頗滯、查全日各帮買去僅二百餘包、此種生意冷淡情形、爲多日未、因之人心不振、但買方態度仍安靜、預料節後實銷、恐有發展、所以節後市面、當有一度變化、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉趨落、上日廣帮了結、致人心帶鬆、各月跌二·三角至五六角、二三盤聞天津帮對於現紗有進胃、同時空頭來進、市盤突然回漲、結果各月漲一·三·五·六·角、午後市况忽然轉疲、賣風稍起、因上日天津帮購買現紗祇數十包、且日紗價跌二元外、因此形勢又變、總之棉紗交易不暢、各月又跌四·五·六·七·角、全日成交統計四萬二千六百包、查賣出達記五百包、大豐一千一百五十包、源大七百包、泰興七百包、賡豐一千一百五十包、長餘六百包、恒昌二千七百五十包、恊生五百包、德記五百包、買進大昶七百五十包、長豐六百五十包、愼記五百五十包、錦昌七百五十包、通記一千包、椿記一千五百包、達記二千五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市甚弱、因美棉及趨下落、有力多頭者業已完全放手、惟某銀行購進四萬多擔、在高價未及放出、故市塲上空氣尙堅、然紗市不佳、現棉需要較少、查本月份檢騐處審查合格之貨、已有四五萬擔之說、因此市面漲力較弱、</p>
<h3>鄭標軟弱狀態</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、隨美棉而跌、塲中買户不多、惟某多頭本月份限價五元三角買進、遠月被其帶緊、拍至二三盤以紗市帶上、結果各月跌五分至二角、午後塲中形勢仍弱、檯面較鬆各月又跌一·二角、全日成交統計九萬六千三百擔、查賣出益昶一千三百擔、泰昌一千七百擔、仁豐二千八百擔、長餘一千八百擔、源大一千八百擔、穗隆一千五百擔、惠康五千一百擔、賡豐三千一百擔、長豐三千八百擔、益豐三千一百擔、新亨一千六百擔、買進大豐三千四百擔、大孚二千六百擔、通記三千八百擔、恒益二千一百擔、振大一千二百擔、愼昌七千一百擔、泰昌一千四百擔、恒昌一千八百擔、長和四千一百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食期粉步見上升</h3>
<p>昨粉市、上午開市後洋麥雖小、然因粉交停市二天、浮户競先抵補、市面開市後迄居挺勢、繼有錢莊帮收買遠期、市乃步砌、午後名月繼續挺站、祇九月份有大廠抛賣、廠方限價二元零九分、故始終未能衝出二元零九分之價以上、餘月有業外囤户與補空收買、均見挺漲、收市價六月八月各漲一分二五、七月十月各漲一分、十一月漲一分半、九月祇大半分、</p>
<h3>期麥晨軟午回</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、洋麥小六七角、現麥湧到、市面與人心均爲虚軟、且行販客户紛紛套賣、開市卽見平軟、午後有補空問津、方始轉機、但收市價遠月仍各小一分、近期則無上落、新麥到銷兩旺、但市面頗穏、高貨明光麥開二元九角、中二元七八角、次至二元六角四分、計由福新去二千一百包、阜豐去七百包、華豐五百包、</p>
<h3>晚稻市盤稍稍轉定</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源仍祇二十七八號、（三四千名）惟其中晚稻頗多、計占有在分之一、是雖北洋帮包胃績能暢辦、而其吃盤遂因此　較轉緊、經售方一度扳做、但結果終難收效、如所去之靑角松泗練塘等貨二千餘包、行情悉已轉呈定盤、各厚粳店胃業已梢能動動、形勢似較轉緊、惟價格猶無上落、杜洋尖依舊平平、陰元未見做開、變元續步跌風、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來源十五六號、市上各種去路、白粳高料平常、中次續化、白元略有交易、早薄稻及各秈零化平淡、市形高白粳定、中次稍緊、白元略有上落、早薄稻及各秈定勢、</p>
<h3>靜定之客秈</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、到銷兩淡、因各方預備度節、無意買賣、進户意在擯小再買、而貨主心思堅定、不肯絲毫貶價輕脫、大約過節後閩帮首先發動、卽本街與浙帮亦有問津之必要、目下進出兩少、大約須到節後方始活動、昨日全市只有本街應酬湖南機紅米五十包、又　靖米六十六包、其他均無交、所開零數爲本街臨時交易、亦非正式市而、價雖稍小、市則居平勢也、</p>
<h3>新莞豆亦見上市</h3>
<p>昨日新莞豆亦已上市、計蕪湖湯莞到七十三包、江北小粒莞到五十包、出品方面蕪湖貨色身兩佳、身份在九五之上、江北貨稍遜均由洋莊辦去、開蕪湖貨三元零三分、江北貨二元八角半、</p>
<p>津帮採去、刻下來源略形稀落、且高貨大多由船轉棧、貨户有扳售之意、故市或可定、</p>
<h3>絲茶新繭運滬絲廠開工</h3>
<p>（滬市已達二十五家）滬市單雙宮絲廠本有一百十三家、近年來海外絲銷一落千丈、絲價慘跌、各絲廠虧倒頻聞、在新繭上市前、勉强工作者祇十一二家、今歲蘇浙春蠶均告豐收、改良種繭質優而售價不大、繭市先後告終、新乾繭次第運滬、本市各絲廠陸續開工、茲　全滬開車絲廠計雲成·怡昌一·二·三·正大·　　·積餘·公大·豐記·源記·復昌·裕通·公記·豐泰·福綸恒·緒興·祥綸·裕豐·統益·通緯·錦雲·楚信·等二十五家、尙有寳泰信昌等數家、現正修理機車、日内卽當開機工作、</p>
<p>（歐美廠經價調查）海外市塲、因日絲商積極廉價競售日新絲、致華絲市面極度疲滯、Ｂ級白廠經「紐約」八十分匀度二十至二十二條份現市售價祇扯四百五六十元、「里昂」十三十五條份祇五百二三十元、各廠商新絲成本須扯五百五六十元、虧本難售、滬市依然停頓、</p>
<p>（雙宮絲印需仍殷）邇來雙宮絲印需仍殷、前是英郵船拉瓦爾兵弟號出口又有雙宮絲二十三包、運英轉運印度、</p>
<p>（電轉廠經價仍小）歐美生絲市塲、現絲廠進仍懈、絲價盤旋、各歐莊昨晨雖接有海外來賬、而白廠經來價仍小、華洋雙方談判仍相懸四五十元、卒難就範、昨祇綢廠進黃廠經白乾經各五包、價仍平疲、</p>

<h3>零食</h3>
<p>— 莫朕</p>
<p>出版界的現狀，期刋多而專書少，使有心人發愁，小品多而大作少、又使有心人發愁。人而有心，眞要「日坐愁城」了。</p>
<p>但是，這情形是由來已久的，現在不過略有變遷，更加顯著而已。</p>
<p>上海的居民，原就喜歡喫零食。假使留心聽，則屋外呌賣零食者，總是「實繁有徒」。桂花白糖倫敦糕，猪油白糖蓮心粥，暇肉餛飩麫，芝蔴香蕉，南洋芒果，西路密橘，瓜子大王，還有蜜餞，橄欖，等等，等等，只要胃口好，可以從早晨直喫到半夜，但胃口不好也不好也不妨，因爲這又不比肥魚大肉，分量原是很少的。那功效，是在消閒之中，得麗年之益，而且味道好。</p>
<p>前幾年的出版物，是有「養生之益」的零食，或曰「入門」，或臼「ＡＢＣ」，或曰「槪論」，總之是薄薄的一本，只要化錢數角，費時半點鐘，便能明白一種科學，或全盤文學，或一種外國文。意思就是說，只要喫一包五香瓜子，便能使這人發榮滋長，抵得喫五年　。試了幾年，功效不顯，於是有些灰心了。一試騐，如果有名無實，是往往不免灰心的，　如現在已經很少有人修仙或鍊金，而代以浩　泉和買獎劵，便是試騐無效的結果。於是放養了。「養生」這一面，側到「味道好」那一面去了。自然，零食也還是零食。上海的居民，和零食是死也分拆不開的。</p>
<p>於是而出現了小品，但也並不是新花樣。當老九章生意興隆的時候，就有過「筆記小說大觀」之流，這是零食一大箱；待到老九章關門之後，自然也跟着成了一小撮。分量少了，爲什麽倒弄得鬧鬧嚷嚷，滿城風雨的呢？我想，這是因爲在擔子上裝起了篆字和羅馬字母合璧的年紅電燈的招牌。</p>
<p>然而，雖然仍舊是零食，上海居民的感應力却比先前敏捷了，否則又何至於鬧嚷嚷。但這也許正因爲神經衰弱的緣故。假使如此，那麽，零食的前途倒是可慮的。</p>
<h3>什麽是文言</h3>
<p>— 曹棨仁</p>
<p>「···等到白話文風行全國，人人都可以多少用文字發表他的意思，那士的階級向來所居奇的能力也就無所施其技了。·······中國文字的通俗化，對於人民一方面是使他們得到一個新的發表意思的工具，幾千萬以先緘默的人如果學到三五百字就可以發表他們簡單的意思、而對於士的階級一方面正是剝奪了他們唯一的武器。······老先生們反對白話文不是無意識的；那正是他們最末次的奮鬥，他們生命最終的光燄。」</p>
<p>丨丨陶孟和：士的階級有人告訴我：「『文言復興』，「小學讀經」，有人在倡導，在附和，甚囂塵上，復古運動怕的眞會成爲事實呢，」我微笑不答，請他把倡導者的文章給我看。我說：他們自已所做的，算得是文言嗎？世事正如此離奇，凡憧憬於文言的，其病正在於根本不了解「什麽是文言」這種「新民叢報」式的文體，不獨桐城正宗　之以鼻，卽斯文種子必搖頭嘆息以爲世道人心之大患（見康梁二氏），而他們沾沾自喜以爲他們做的便是文言，豈非大大的笑柄！　　單說倡導文言復興是頑固守舊，不足以服其心的，我且平心靜氣地來談談所謂「文言的究竟」。我想，倡導文言復興的，總該服膺桐城派的主張，那是他們的老祖師。在桐城派姚們四弟子中，以方東樹爲最拘謹，且看他的說法：「三代之書，詞氣遞降，時代爲之也。况在晚近，古訓罕通，與其文之而人不曉，何如卽所共喻，而使之易曉乎？」（書林揚解）曾國藩幕下，習古文者以吳擊甫（汝倫）造詣最高，請聽他的主張：「中國非廢漢文無以普及敎育；蓋漢文過於艱深，人自幼學之，非經數十寒暑，不能斐然可觀，而人已垂老無用，吾國學問不及東西洋之進步者此也。」徐彬彬先生說得好：「人無新舊，只須事理明達，自有平心中肯之主張。」　　愛開倒車的人，大都是數典忘祖不通事理的笨伯！</p>
<p>將「文言」和「白話」對立，以爲兩者絶不相侔；他們自以爲覇了那個營壘，竪起師旗，和白話這營壘對敵起來，這是一應錯誤觀念的根源。語言文字，在社羣中產生，在社羣中應用，永遠在不斷的變選進程中，要想截取一時一地的語文，名之爲文言，名之爲古文，那是絶對不可能的。劉知凡云：」天長地久，風俗無恒，後之視今，亦猶今之視昔；而作者皆怯書今語，勇效昔言，不其惑乎！」又云：「夫三傳之說旣不習於尙書，兩漢之詞又多違於戰策，足以騐甿俗之遞改，知歲時之不同。而後來作者通無遠識，記其當世口語，罕能從實而書，方復追傚昔人，示其稽古。用使周秦言辭，見於魏晋之代，楚漢應對，行乎宋齊之日，僞修混沌，失彼天然，今古以之不純，眞僞由其相亂。一我們用歴史的眼光來觀察語言文字的變遷，卽知「文言」二字根本不能成立，他們所據的是夢幻的境界，並沒有實際的營壘，拿什麽來和「白話」對壘呢！</p>
<p>原來中國語言文字，以秦代爲分水綫。秦代以前，各民族經營各自的文化，運用自已的方言寫文章，今日所謂周秦古文，在當時正是方言文。狀人之美，滬語爲「漂亮」，以之行文，文言者總以爲太俗，必改用「窈窕」·「艷麗」方爲古雅。而言言云：「窕·艷·美也。宋衛晋鄭之間曰艷·陳楚周南之間曰窕。」刻正是那時的方言；必廢「漂亮」而取「艷」·「窕」·豈非知二五而不知一十？初民人事簡單，初用交字，以一字狀，義。（同是外族，東曰夷，西曰戎，南曰蠻，北曰狄。）人事漸繁，字日增多，記憶上十分困難，自然而然趨向於用詞的新路。用詞傾向，周秦之間已漸萌芽，漢以後格外顯明，單字廢而複嗣興，由簡趨繁，勢所必然。漢晋以後，複詞之增，與時代成正比，至白話文乃純用複詞。主文言的無非憧憬古代用單字之簡樸，而不知古人正苦於简樸之不足以應用呢？袁中郎雪濤閣　序云：「夫古有古之時，今有今之時，襲古人語言之迹，而　以爲古，是處嚴冬而襲夏之葛者也。」袁伯修白蘇　集論文云：「今之圓領方袍，所以學古人之綴葉蔽皮也。今之五味煎熬，所以學古人之茹毛飲血也。古人之意期於飽口腹，蔽形體，今人之意亦期於飽口復蔽形體，未嘗異也。彼摘古人字句入已著作中，是無異綴業於衣袂之中，投毛於殽核之内也。大抵古人之文專期於達，而今人之文專期於不達，以不達學達，是可謂學古者乎？他倆的話，正是主張文言復興者的對症良藥！</p>
<p>主文言者必高談漢魏古文，把司馬　捧到天上。假使他們處在司馬遷的時代，至少該復興殷周之文。而司馬遷作五帝本紀，將　典「允釐百工，庶績咸熙」譯爲「信飭百官，衆功皆興。」豈不廢文言而改用漢代白話了嗎？臯陶　：「下民昏墊，予乘四載，隨山刋木，曁益秦庶鮮食。」豈不簡古，而史記夏本紀必改爲「下民皆服於水，予陸行乘車，水行乘舟，泥行乘　，行山刋木與益予衆，庶稻鮮食。」不是捨簡取繁，承認今語勝於古語嗎？主文言者必推崇韓柳歐蘇，以爲唐宋古文，盡美盡善。韓退之樊紹述墓誌銘云：「惟古於　必　出，降而不能　　　。宋祁好　古字，歐陽悠　　宵寐　禎，札蘭鴻　」八子以嘲之。唐宋古文家病當時文人好用古語，（猶今人好用文言）矯揉造作，故以「平文」易之（古文之名，明人所造。唐宋文人皆稱平文，平文者平整通達之文，猶小說之有平話。）韓柳復生於今世，必斥文言復興爲　　。主文言者必祖述桐城派，桐城派以歸有光爲祖，方姚之先，　有顧亭林，魏禧諸家繼之。顧亭林日知錄論文人求古之病曰：「後周書雄蚪傳：「時人論文體有今古之異，蚪以爲「時有今古，非文有今古。」此至當之論。夫今之不　　二漢，猶　漢之不能爲尙　　氏，　剿或　漢中　　法以　　　　　　其　二字句　　之於文，殊爲不稱。以今日之地爲不古，而借古地我；以今日之官爲不古，而借古官名；舍今日恒用之字，而借古事之通用者，皆文人所以自盡其俚淺也。」未知主文言復興者讀之作何感想？歸光所以異於前後七子者，前後七子一意做假古董，　虎不成，弄巧反拙：歸有光自平易近情入手，反入勝境。桐城派主張運用士大夫階級的雅馴詞語，時地官制必用今制，大小篇幅集注於一中心點，其意卽在糾正前後七子復古觀念之錯誤，使學文者易曉，與時代相適應，豈有「生今之世」而可行古之道」者乎　以上所論，都是老生常談，本不必說了又說。我不過如收了機個劣等生，再三耳提面命，希望他們旣莫自誤，更莫誤盡天下蒼生。最要緊的，他們該明白所謂文言者，根本沒有這樣東西，不必再作夢想，說夢話了！（阿堵，寗馨，舊文人所謂文言文也；此皆晋人土語（阿堵）猶言（這個），「寗馨」猶言「這么樣」。史記」狀周勃之口吃，故云：「臣期期以爲不可」舊文人乃以「期期以爲不可」爲文言。聖人云知之爲知之，不知爲不知，是知也，不懂什么是文言的人，還是免開尊口罷！）</p>
<h3>箇舊廠（下）</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>洞内是非常悶，加以一個個進去揹鑛的，頭上還挿着熊熊燃燒的煤氣燈，所以洞内的空氣差不多就完全是濃厚的炭氣，等到進去把鑛揹出來時，人的面色已變灰白，氣喘呼呼的忙將沉重的兩口袋鑛砂摔在地上，人便是這麽要死一般的靠在褡　上。</p>
<p>這幅可憐的樣子，我一見便呆住了，我丨丨一個十二三歲的孩子，遠離開爸媽到此地來，不也是要幹這種非人的工作嗎？</p>
<p>我凄然的想哭，但是我不敢，我默默地踉着那個「走水」的熟人，由這家伙房至那家伙房，踏着一堆堆的鑛砂，沙沙地走過去。</p>
<p>在路上，他講給我聽，那些挑鑛的人是做「草皮活」的，那些爬進洞裏去的，是「下班」的。······</p>
<p>「你要做草皮活嗎？下班？」忽然他問着我。「做草皮活的要一天挑到晚，下班的只要一天能揹得够那幾桶鑛，就可以了。你是喜歡那樣？」</p>
<p>我恐懼的沒有回答他。</p>
<p>他領着我到了花扎口的一家伙房裏，一隻大黑毛狗，氣勢洶洶的猛向我們撲來，但給伙房的人攔住了，此地的狗多是這樣兇惡呵，那個「走水」的熟人說。</p>
<p>在伙房裏，吃過了飯，（飯是沙穀夾雜着的糙米飯，菜是唯一的一鉢「老媽媽湯」）那個「走水」的熟人便把我介紹給老板，並且還說我是可以下班的，工錢隨便······</p>
<p>老板抬着烟筒望着我，嘿的笑了一聲：「好好，明天你就學學！」</p>
<p>老板說了後，我的心裏却是異樣的感覺得難過！</p>
<p>在那晚上，我躱在被單裏，沒有使人知道，悄悄的淌了幾滴悲哀的眼淚！</p>
<p>這地方是一個活地獄喲：有着無人性的殘，蠻横的忍剝削，黑暗的壓迫，不到此地來，天哪，我怎麽曉得呢？</p>
<h3>桂英爸（二）</h3>
<p>— 曄子</p>
<p>我因此不大下樓。每到同妻他們也無話可說無事可爲的時候，我就上床睡覺，暫時把寂寞丢在帳子外面。</p>
<p>這樣的一直過了半個月之後，我纔如獲至寳一般的發現了桂英爸。</p>
<p>「知道」桂英爸是較早的事情，桂英和婆的兩個姊姊是同學，和妻也很要好，彼此還是鄰居。桂英的家和酒店只隔了兩個别的人家。桂英嫁了一個南京人，住在上海。家中只　了年老的父親和母親。她那母親和我的岳母是朋友，我的岳母之所以肯把最幼的愛女嫁給我這「外路人」，還是受了桂英媽的勸告而决定的，因此，桂英媽常對我們以恩人自居，呌我們休要把她忘了。在這一點上，我固然感激她，但我對於她，其實還是憎惡的感情居多。她的樣子很醜，稀疏的頭髮，蓬着不梳，一隻眼是瞎的，但那一隻孤獨的亮眼，却蓄着很多兇光，似乎把那一隻瞎眼所應有的兇不也併在一起了。她的臉色黃中帶靑，却配上一張血盆似的大嘴，嘴裏只　了一個上門牙。她露着這一個尖刀似的門牙，專門駡街以及挑撥是非，半條西街的人都對她存着戒心。她不常笑，但當她笑的時候，嘴張得愈開，門牙露得愈出，樣子也就愈可怕。她的左手是麻木了的，老是呌右手抬着。脚也有點毛病，走路一拐一瘸地。她身上穿的老是髒得發臭的一套黑衣，令人作嘔。這一切，把她　成一個鬼物的樣子。只有我的岳母同她相當要好，聽信她的幾句話，此外則誰也對她沒有好感。</p>
<p>不但旁人，連親生女兒的桂英，對她的感情也很壞，桂英是能幹的女人，她在外面做事，每月總寄十多塊錢到娘家，但好的心是很痛苦的。有一回，我們同她在上海遇見，談到家中的狀况時，她泫然地說：</p>
<p>「我是很爲難的，這些錢，不寄去也不好，寄去也不好。我的錢本是想寄給爸爸用的，爸爸一向待我好他又太辛苦，太可憐。年紀六十多了，還在賣燒餅賣山粉腐，而且自從我的哥哥去世他哀傷得幾乎發瘋，頽唐得了不得。現在他所望的只有我了，我一定要安慰他　　我每月寄十塊錢去，本來他可以不做買賣的了。然而我那娘，實在太狼，我寄去的錢，都是她一個人藏着，一文也不給爸爸用，仍舊逼着爸爸做買賣。她很知道享福，每天非魚肉不能下飯，但是她不讓爸爸同享，留給他的只有骨頭和湯。這種情形說來眞慘！有時候。，我氣不過，想不寄錢了，我記得母親從前怎樣虐待我，我失了業連在家裏吃口飯都不許，把我逼到外面來。幸而我的運氣還好，得到朋友們的帮助，居然在高中讀畢業，嫁了丈夫，現在自已也有個職業，這都是我自已赤手空拳掙出來的，父母對我有何恩惠。只因爲爸爸太可憐，我纔想對他盡點責任，誰知結果爸爸仍沒有受到我的好處，反被狠心的母親占了便宜，那麽我的錢豈不是化得太寃枉了還要寄它則甚？然而，我仔細一想，要是我不寄錢去，母親待爸爸一定會得更惡，那麽爸爸愈將吃苦了。總是爲了爸爸，所以我依舊按月把錢去　我母親的　　。</p>
<p>當我住在岳母家裏的時候，我還不曾知道這些情形。那時候，我只知道桂英媽是個老厭物，而她和她的丈夫却是很苦的。桂英爸在城門洞下賣山粉腐，站在酒店門口就可以望見他，是一個秃頂而矮胖的老頭子。他到酒店裏來打酒的時候，我也見過幾回。他看見我，總是微笑地點一點頭，不說話，接了酒，默默地付了錢就走。我是每天下午都要吃一些點心的，而街上雖然冷淸，但也常有賣麵和賣山粉腐的經過，有一回，我正在酒店門口等，忽然桂英爸送來了一大碗山粉腐請我吃。山粉腐是我本來所喜歡的，但是對於他所賣的，我却不敢領敎。因爲我看到他的山粉腐，就要聯想到桂英媽的樣子以及他們那低小陰黑的房子的樣子，這樣一聯想，就連看着那碗山粉腐也要作嘔了。</p>
<p>那一回幸而是阿仁替我效勞，吃完了那一大碗。但從此以後，我就專實麵吃，而不買别人的山粉腐了。要是我買别人的山粉腐，桂英爸一定是仍會看見的，這是太難乎爲情了。</p>
<p>聽妻她們說起，桂英爸曾有一個兒子，當革命的時代做過縣黨部的常務委員，後來被槍斃了。從此以後，桂英爸的神經就有點異樣。有時候默不作聲，做完生意就呆坐在自已家裏的屋角流淚，有時候爆發起來，則故言亂語，手舞足蹈，在街上大鬧</p>
<p>我的知道的桂英爸的情形，就只有這些。但在起初的半個月内，我沒有見他「爆發」過一次，大槪那時候正是沉默期了。</p>

<h3>電界之聲　日本通與意大利通</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>日人之熟諳我國情形能說我語言者，輒被稱爲「支那通」，於是我國仿之，有「日本通」之名詞出。「通」非惡名，就個人言，祇須抱定公而無私，就事業言，則屬於交通，無論關係國際或國内，通之一字，更具重大之意義；惟時至今日，通亦難言，有黨通而通者，有不當通而不可通者，權衡審愼，當局率於此三致意焉。</p>
<p>日本以暴力攫取東北，造成僞滿，舉國上下，莫不悲憤，但依據經過事實，中日間之國際關係，依然存在；中日間之國際貿易，亦依然不絶。縱時見入超，然我國輸出額，按月亦達六七百萬元之數，貿易所需，通信自繁，此外關於外交及私人往來電報，按諸歷年統計，亦見增進。昔時報務，經由水綫，權非自主，利多外溢，自經我國國際無綫電台，積極擴充，依照規定步驟，旣已分别與歐美各國先後通電矣，獨對於日本，遲未實現，揆諸情形，未免失策。况中日間通信聯絡，彼已有政府自辦之滬崎水綫，根基早樹，此次無綫電路卽不完成，在彼固然所傷，在我則獨遭損失。茲旣要訂合同，權操自我，斯後我政府及商民拍寄日本電報，均得由自辦之國際電羣傳遞。在獨立主權下發展國際通信，增裕國庫收入，是則無綫電「日本通」，自有其「通」之必要，初非不黨通而通也。</p>
<p>國際無綫電　，截至現在，通達全世界計十二處。美德法俄旣通於前，英日電路，又通於後，茲正與意大利騐，正式開放，不日可期，一通而無所不通，對於各國然，對於日本亦然，故由國際通信之原則及立塲上觀察，新近無綫電之日本通，與本年以前之美法德俄通，本年二月之英國通，轉瞬之意大利通，均無二致，决不能與社會注目之僞滿通車通郵等問題併爲一談也。</p>
<h3>電報業務稽查員與民衆</h3>
<p>— 開</p>
<p>我國電報事業，創辦以來，已有五十多年的歷史，但與歐美各國及東鄰日本比較，其普遍發達程度，相差尙遠！致其所以不發達不普遍之綠故，當然非常複雜；如國民知旘程度太低，尙未養成發電習慣，電報價目太高，超過一般民衆經濟能力，加之内戰頻仍，商業蕭條，官電充斥，擁塞綫路等等，都是電報不能發達之重大原因，而歷來電報事業本身，腐敗官僚習氣太深，亦是阻碍　報進化之一端。當局有鑒於此，深知欲謀電報事業之發達普遍，非先從電報事業本身之革新不可，非將電界中一切腐化宫化積習，澈底剷除，積極振作不可，所以近來種種設施與改革，均按步向商業化民衆化方面進行。當局又以爲僅謀内部整頓與革新，而不與民衆方面時常接觸聯絡，民衆對於電報事業，仍舊抱瘈從前漠視態度，則對於發展電報事業之前途，仍不免有許多隔膜和阻力，於是各繁要局臺，乃有電報業務稽查員之創設。每日出外查詢，宣傳，解釋，藉與民衆作切實之聯絡，以爲改進業務之借鏡，是則電報局臺之設置電報業務稽查員，就便利民衆與發展事業上言之，確具有深切之意義與董大之使命也。　　電報業務稽查員，旣然爲便利民衆與推進業務而設置，其職務亦就此原則，而有詳細之規定：</p>
<p>（一）收發報人對於發寄電報各項省費辦法或章程手續，有不明瞭之處，應一一詳細解答。</p>
<p>（二）收發報人對於往來電報，如有稽延錯誤情事，應代爲查對追究，俾收發報人得一圓滿之答復。</p>
<p>（三）收發報人對於電報局　有不滿意之處：如來報不譯，抄寫不淸，違章收費，報差需索等等，儘可和盤托出，稽查員自應切實報告局臺，藉可據以改善或取締。</p>
<p>（四）收發報人如有對於局臺應興應革之意見，儘可向其建議，稽查員應誠懇接受，代達當局，酌予採納實施。</p>
<p>（五）收發報人如需要各項電報章程電報價目表及去報紙等，應儘量供給。</p>
<p>（六）收發報人對於Ｃｙｖａ（卽國際無綫電臺）有不明瞭之處，應將該臺創設經過，内容辦事情形，詳細陳說，俾得了解國際電臺之眞相。</p>
<p>總而言之，從前民衆對於報局臺種種隔膜，要藉稽查員之訪問解釋，使之明白了解，從前電報局臺種種缺黠，要藉稽查員之查詢澈究，使之日益改進。所以身任電報業務稽查員者，固應澈底認識本身職務之性質，及所負使命之重大，努力出勤，各盡其職，無論向商行機關團體及私人查詢宣傳之時，態度務宣謙和，言詞務須懇切，對答務須詳明，建議務須誠懇接受，務使各收發電報民衆，無形之中得到一種良好之影象，而在收發電報的民衆方面，也應深切了解，電報業務稽查員之對於民衆，是有百利而無一害，凡遇彼等前來查詢之時，應予以種種便利，俾能完成其使命。如此電報業務，得民衆之恊助乃可達到眞正商業化與民衆化之目的。</p>
<h3>無綫電應用短波的研究（三）</h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>短波無綫電話通信，有時因通話過遠，而放能發見低减，這是因爲送話器通話尤遠，上綫上的發射力尤應加大，如發射力維持舊有程度，則送話效率，勢須减弱。普通極長電波的無綫電話，其天綫上的電力，實際放射的，不過百分之十至十五而已，如爲十五公尺的較短電波，則天綫上放射的電力，往往達百分之七十。由此觀之，譬如其一長波，其電源的電力爲三百基羅瓦特（Ｋｉｌｏ·ｗａｔｔ·Ｋ·Ｗ·）則供給大綫者，將爲一百五十基羅瓦特，而實際放射的，不過十七基羅瓦特。如爲短波，電力爲三十基羅瓦特，天綫上需要十基羅瓦特，而放射的電力，亦可達七基羅瓦特。若此短波機的天綫，爲定向式的，所有放射電波，都集中在一方向，其力量的宏大，自不待言。</p>
<p>無綫電應用短波，對於通信回路，得有大量的增加，短波的能普通遍實用，大致此亦理由之一。茲試舉一例，假定，某一較長的電波，其周波帶有五十至一百基羅周波秒的範圍，則就使將各周波帶的闊度，减少至二千二百周波，（此數在商用無綫電上，已爲最小限度），所有周波輸送力，互相擠壓，使各周波帶間，幾無餘隙可容，然而所得有效的通信回路，仍不能超過二十五。如在使用短波的塲合，照近代實騐所得結果，在六千至一萬二千基羅周波秒的周波率範圍内，使用二百回路的無綫電話，其各發電周波帶間的隙度，仍可有三十基羅周波秒，試將此項隙度，减少至十基羅周波秒，則可用的無綫電話回路，可以增加三倍，共得六百回路，這是事實所可能，亦爲短波進步的一點。</p>
<p>瑣屑述來，綴成短文，而短波無綫電通信的利弊，似已詳論無遺，本來電波遞信，瞬息萬變，短波固未達盡善盡美的境地，欲其改良至於百利而無一弊，誠非一朝一夕之功，可以達其目的，但是，以現代科學的萬能，日後的進步，無可計日以待。</p>
<h3>電信綫路</h3>
<p>— 寄然</p>
<p>電信—無綫電電報電話除外—無論其爲電報或電話，所以構成相互間之電氣聯絡，實現傳遞電信之工作，厥賴綫路與機械。機械屬於内部，其如何構造？如何管理？如何動作？非參觀局内裝置，社會人士，每不易悉其大槪。至綫路方面，所經過者，城市間之街道，鄉野間之田塍，以及汽車道旁，鐵路地帶，巍然豎立，蜿蜒如帶者，目所接觸，隨處可見。我人習焉若忘，初無足奇，以爲此種電桿電綫，不過爲一種通信之工具；然或細加默想，則此一根細綫之上，每秒鐘間，有若斷若續之各種符號電流，或忽亮忽沉之各種談話電流，在交互地流動，在不絶地往來。苟使電波經過，有方法可以映入人之眼簾，當見有長短不同，負有傳信使命之電流，在些微電綫上，交流着，直流着。其迅速之程度，非言語所可形容，總之，與各種能力之傳送相比較，「電」之速度，儘次於「光」一面已。</p>
<p>電信綫路，約舉之可分爲架空綫路，地下綫路，水底綫路三種，地下及水底綫路，均用電纜：而架空綫路，則除裸綫之外，亦有用電纜者。大抵綫路藉支持物，高架空中者，名曰架空。　所架之綫條，或亦可稱爲明綫（卽裸綫），因其明而易見，與電纜中綫條，外層包蔽者，得一顯著之區别。</p>
<p>在陸地上建設電信綫路（包括電報電話），使用電纜，在美國頗屬常見；蓋兩城相隔，距離不遠，長途電話之敷設，往往舍明綫而取電纜。若綫路逾千里以上，如非應需綫條之數量，超過一根電桿所能擔負，率皆利用明綫，以通報話。考厥原因，由於電纜之成本較貴，工費又倍昻。在經濟上着想，明綫固甚有利益也。我國電信事業，雖有五十餘年之歷史，除沿海及長江一帶，間用水底電纜，城市電話，有用架空或地下電纜者外，其餘遠程陸上通信，以採用架空明綫爲多。</p>
<p>綫路經過，江，河，湖，海，無繞道之可能，應用水底電纔，殊無疑義。若横斷大陸之遠程通信，非事業上所需要，則多主用明綫。美國爲電話最發達之國家，故紐約至斐勒特爾斐亞，聯絡華盛頓等處，及其西部横經大陸各重要城市均用地下電纜，是因電話之需要激增，其回綫數量，有非電桿所能負荷者，此層已如上述。至就實用方面言，電纜深埋地裏，對於風雪災害，影響可免，平時維持費用，可以節省；不過一旦發生障碍，開掘修理，耗工費時，不及明綫一經發覺，沿途巡視，立能以迅速方法修復耳。</p>
<p>上舉已將綫路之構成，約略申說，惟猶有欲言者，明綫之在歐美，逐漸有捨而改用電纜之勢，尤以在都市内爲甚。都市之内，綫條縱横，舉凡電燈電車等等，星羅棋布，有碍市容，且多危險。救濟辦法，惟有將綫條深藏地裏（卽地下電纜）或成纜懸空（卽架空電纜）；且長途電話之發達，有日升月進之趨向，因電話回路之增加，處處右咸覺電纜之需要而製造公司更復探索研究，以成完善。至近年經專家之發明，如增音設備，足以　大話機之收音，電波載送，足以增加傳　之效率，電纜之用途既廣，幹路之採用隨繁，此在電信發達之國家，固已視明綫爲較落伍但衡諸我國，則以現在業務之尙未充分發達，使用電纜，尙非切要，此由情形之不同，殊未可一槪而論也。</p>
<h3>公衆合作對於電話事業之關係</h3>
<p>— 汪啓堃</p>
<p>電話事業之性質，對於國家則屬於交通事業，對於地方則屬於公用事業。其使命之完成及業務之發展，固端賴經營機關之努力，然亦須待公衆予以合作與維　，始能充分達到目的。所謂公衆者，包括一切電話用户在内，軍政機關苟裝用電話，電話局卽視之爲對手之公衆。茲以首都爲例，將電話事業與公衆間之關係、分述於後。</p>
<p>（一）財政</p>
<p>電話事業旣係國營，其經費自應由國家籌措，然在國家財政困難之際，公衆苟需要電話，亦宜共體時艱，予以經濟上之援助，俾得早日擴充，而公衆亦可早日利用，有相當之利益上收穫。以日本言，民國十二年大地震時，其東京横濱二處之電話幾全毁滅。因財政關係，僅能按期恢復舊用户之電話，更無餘力以事擴充。然請裝電話者照例逐年增加，勢難一槪拒絶；不得不另定變通辦法，由新用户担任建設費。其後經國會制定法案，電話可認爲用户之資產，得隨意買賣，惟新用户每裝電話一具，須繳工程費一千五百元日金。復因電話局之恢復工程與擴充工程，旣多且鉅，勢難全數新用户同時裝設，每年僅能收容一部分，定期公開拍籤，中者始得付欵裝機，卽可無需設法購用。吾國靑島一地亦仿此法，惟工程費定爲二百三十五元；故話局收入較豐，擴充較易。首都電話局除浦口外，有總分局三所，總局之容量爲三千號，數用前已裝滿，不能再加；故决定增設南分局，先裝二千號之設備，並已購定相當地基，然因經費支絀，擴充不得不稍遲延，其困難情形，似爲公衆所諒解者也。</p>
<p>次之，再以日本而言，其政府對於電話之擴充，固極努力；然財力究有限，電話預算須經國會通過，每年僅能在　若干地開設新局。公衆對於電話之需要，旣甚殷急，勢難視若無覩，故又制定特設電話辦法。某地公衆如欲於國家預算外，提前特設電話局，可聯名呈請，由政府爲之計劃一切，所需工料各費，統由呈請者分担，供獻於國家，事前事後皆毫無報酬，惟其地接至全國之長途電話，則由國家籌建（此當然亦需事前列入預算内）。返觀吾國，交通部以經費關係，不能積極擴充市内之長途電話，各省乃紛起自行設立，同一電話事業，在日本則公衆無代價的供獻於國家，在中國則有屬於地方者，屬於中央者，價目制度，互有　　。日人譏吾國爲無組織，雖意存汚衊，吾人似亦宜反窮自者。　　復次，用户有使用電話之權利，卽有納費之義務。在東西洋各國，用户海先期繳付租費，良我義務應先於權利，且電話苟係國家所經營，租費無異於稅收也。我國僅靑島一地之用户，例於每季初到話局預付租費三個月，其他各地幾皆由話局派員分往收取，往往有欠費等情事。此雖由於收費員催收不力或品行不端，苟用户能抱合作之精神，自用的到局繳費，則不獨話局收費員可裁，且可防意外之弊端。郵政與電報旣皆須到局繳費，電話未嘗不可如此。</p>
<p>（二）使用</p>
<p>電話用户之使用方法是否適宜，對於電話事業之服務能否滿意，極有關係。蓋　話局之設備無論如何周密，皆有一定的限制，而以自動式爲尤甚；倘用户無節制的使用，斯供應難期相應，話局與用户將同感痛苦。茲將用户使用電話時所應注意各點，分述於後：</p>
<p>一，用户號數登載號簿上，今年起交通部令各話局將裝拆遷移更名之用户，業印號簿更正單，每月一次，以便　檢查。惟新裝用户仍有不及印入者，故話局設有間訊臺，以便用户查詢一切。首都公衆之習慣，於打　話前每不檢查號簿，卽呌問訊臺代查；以致此種不必要的呼數意外增多，佔用機綫，妨碍正當通話。用户苟肯顧全大局，勿憚於翻閱號簿，直一舉手之勞耳。</p>
<p>二，用户遷移時每將電話留讓他人項替，接受者又每圖省事省錢，久不報請過户，以致號簿上仍載舊户名稱。外人如欲接至此用户，旣不能自號簿上查知其號數，問訊臺亦無從查復；囑查者誤以爲問訊臺服務不周，固有關名譽，然發話人與此用户間之正事亦被躭誤，雙方皆受其害。</p>
<p>三，電話局設備有限，全局用户不能同時通話，至多亦不過十之二三。用户如在冗長無聯之通話，不獨久佔機綫，妨碍他人正當通話；卽他處發來之緊要通話，亦無從接到，自誤誤人，莫此爲甚。在每日電話較忙時（例如上午十時至一時，下午三時至四時，）尤宜力避無謂之通話。</p>
<p>（三）綫路</p>
<p>電話綫路設於路旁，因經費關係，不能一槪派人巡守，端賴軍警及公衆爲之維護，遇有盜竊或損壞，卽通知話局，俾從速修理，以利交通。至於電桿及電綫設於私人田地，原係不得已之舉；如地方認爲有碍，可囑其遷移，否則要求賠償。民國十八年八月五日國府公佈之電信條件，其第十八條規定：「國營電信機關之綫路，不論經過何地，得擇便建設。但因妨碍私人之權利，經被損害者之請求，由國民政府行政院交通部或其委托機關查明確實後，得給以相當之賠償。」長途電話及電報之木桿，除極小一部分外，皆植於私地上，不免妨碍農作物，然公衆諒解電信事業之重要？並抱先公後私之犧牲精神，向不要求此項賠償。其在日本則規定電桿植於私地上，每年應付租費銀一分，然亦無人向政府索取此項租費。近來首都電話局接得一奇異的警告書，略謂今日貴局代張××公館裝置電話，電綫竟穿過，魏××已地三丈餘領空，本人雖係浙江嵊縣人，在南京人地生疏，是亦不失爲中華民國一份子，對貴局有組織的侵害本人產業，謹特提出警告，限三日内答覆理由，否則决求司法及行政解决，等語。此君竟將國營電信機關之綫路，與擅飛華北領空之日本軍用飛機，等量齊觀，其曲解不待辭闢。獨念首都之資產階級，對於電話綫路之性質，尙不能認識，當然不肯合作而加以維護；無　五千年前吾國初創電報時，湖南等省公衆因風水關係，有焚毁電桿之學。　有進者，長途電話及電報綫路之大部分，經過市外，其至設於窮鄉僻野，其測　時之標榕，建設後之桿綫，幾皆設於私人土地，倘不能得地主之合作，在在有失窮被　之虞，卽卽無從完成其使命。</p>
<p>總上所述三項，公衆合作對於電話事　之關係，其重要已可槪見。夫電話之發展旣與公衆之利益有關，公衆諒亦不　合作。電話愈發達，則愈需要公衆之合作，公衆愈合作，則愈能使電話發　；此二事互與因果，交相利賴，如謀電話事業之進展斯吾人所期　於公衆　不得不股且切也。</p>
<h3>談電信用木桿（一）</h3>
<p>— 幹</p>
<p>電桿有木桿，鐵桿，三和土桿，三和土桿等數種。其中以木桿價値較廉，爲用亦最廣，故先述木桿。</p>
<p>報話綫路上使用之木桿，材亦不一。在美國所採用者，有杉木，栗木，紅松等種。大抵美國森林較富，就地取材，可省運輸之費，故落機山以西綫路，多用紅松；而東方各州及中部，產杉栗爲多，電桿採伐，亦取以上二種。就比。較上言，電桿取材，以杉木爲多數國家所樂用，因其农漸生長，幹部挺直，適合於電綫路之裝置。栗木卽多彎曲，用諸市内，頗不如杉木之美觀；不過有一長處，杉木乾燥易裂，而栗木則否。普通電豎立於人烟稠密之區，頻受薰炙，輒易鬆脆，惟栗木能忍受無妨。又桿木着火時，栗木因内質堅强，抵抗力獨大，而受燒亦較别種木材，遲而能耐，此固不無可取也。歐洲各國，以木材產量不多，自給之外，間有運自美洲者。其所用木桿，產於本洲者，祇斯干地拿維亞，芬蘭，及蘇俄之一部。大半係紅松之類；惟西比利亞，森林極富，能適用於電桿者亦多。歷年運銷於我國東北及關内，數頗不少，卽所稱黄華松是也。　　我國木材，内地各省，種植爲多　廣西，湖南，江西，福建等省，年有大批木材，行銷於外。尤以漢口居全國中心，爲木商匯集之地。　信所用木桿，多數源自漢口，非有不得已原因，絶少購自外洋。我國電信用材料，機械電綫，以至零件，大半仰給他邦。以實業之不興，製造之無力，漏巵甚大，迄今尙無法挽回；惟此木桿，與舶來品較，殊無遜色，爲一般從事電信者所採用，如碩果之僅存焉。涉筆至此，爲之喟然。　　雖然，就電信一端而論，每年需用之木桿，已有巨大之數目。據美國統計，全國所有電桿，在三千五百萬根以上。假如木桿之壽命平均爲十年，則每年更換十分之一，卽須三百五十萬根木桿。我國電信，於民國二十年調查，截至十九年底止，計有綫路十七萬五千八百七十三里，電桿之數，計一百十八萬七千九百三十四根，如以美國作比例，亦須年換十一萬八千餘根。苟我國造林事業，不加講求，勢必電信需要之桿，旦旦而伐之，亦恐難乎爲繼，况其他賴乎木材之供給者，正指不勝屈。總理提倡造林，其理由雖不祇一端，卽小之從電信用途上着想，亦應喚起社會上之注意也。</p>
<h3>電信世界</h3>
<p>— 楨芳</p>
<p>蘇俄電信之新建設</p>
<p>二月二十五日爲喬治亞蘇聯制度成立第十三週之期。第夫力斯，莫斯科間（三，二一八公里）之無綫電話，已經完成，正式開放營業。本月以前，莫斯科，塔什干間（三，三二八公里）之短波攝影無綫電話開始工作。此爲蘇聯初設之長距離通信，亦爲世界最長電路之一。本年内莫斯科，伯力間之報話線正從事動工　，其長度爲九，○○○公里，超過紐約至舊金山綫之距離，其新綫將經過薩摩剌，伯力，伊庫斯克，赤塔等處。由伯力至海參崴，阿穆爾省及亞庫次克省之電聯絡綫，亦在計劃設立中。爲增加音量起見擬將建設三十個特别增音站云。</p>
<p>大阪碼頭電話之開放</p>
<p>大阪港連絡船岸之碼頭電話業務，於二月十五日設立，因該埠碼頭與商業中心點之距離頗遠，電話設置，甚爲需用。其話費每日日金五元，但城中通話不收附加費，至長途通話費，照常價徵收。大阪船舶停泊時，船岸間尚無如神户所裝設之無綫電話，該項業務，</p>
<p>法國傳眞電報之推廣</p>
<p>據英國郵政局通告：英法間之傳眞電報業務，現已推廣至波爾多里，里昻，馬寳，尼西，皮斯特拉斯堡等省之市鎭間。嗣後由法至英畫片之傳遞，僅緾巴黎中央電報局接轉足矣。</p>
<p>英國著名電台之停閉</p>
<p>英國哥納瓦爾所屬Ｐｏｌｄｈｕ地方之無綫電台，定於本月月終停閉。此項通告傳出後，引起一班注意。該台爲馬可尼在紐芬蘭接收第一次横斷太西洋莫爾斯信號之台，亦爲第一次傳遞由英到美無，綫電話之台，現因集中研究，無須用此老式電台矣。</p>
<p>美國各商辦電報公司改訂電報價目</p>
<p>美國各商辦電報公司先後通告，自本年起，實行馬德里國際電報會議修訂之各項國際電報價目。原有之十碼暗語，改爲五碼暗語—按尋常電價百分之六十收費。加急電價目，向照尋常電價三倍收費，現改按尋常電價目兩倍收費。又大西洋兩岸往來之優先電報，和按尋常電價加百分之二十五計費，現一律照加急電報計費。此項優先電報價目，向祗適用於美國與歐洲各國往來電報，與其他各國往來者，係稱爲加急電。此次改訂報價卽將優先電辦法取消。據一般人觀察，此後美國與倫敦，巴黎，阿姆斯旦，柏林等處往來國際滙兌，及股票買賣，將受相當影響，因美國原有之優先電報，以交易所及銀行業拍發者居多也。</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>— 社友</p>
<p>改訂無綫電材料進口護照辦法</p>
<p>交部以原有之「無綫電材料臨進口護照時辦法」頗不完備，現經改訂爲「請領無綫電材料進口護照辦法，」呈奉行政院團奉羃府指令核准。此項辦法與舊臨時辦法不同之處，擇要錄後：</p>
<p>一，進口材料屬於收音用品者，領照時應塡長聲請書，連同發貨票及其抄件三分呈部。</p>
<p>二，進口材料屬於發射用品者，領照時除照前條辦理外，應詳叙用途　如係代人訂購琽，應附糧訂購人之用途證明書。</p>
<p>三，發射用品出賣時，出賣商行應取得買主之聲講書呈部，核發許可證後，方得出賣。</p>
<p>四，護照費　照材料價値計算，　費除外。</p>
<p>詳細辦法可向本社函索。</p>
<p>郵電局内將裝設公用電話</p>
<p>交通部爲便利民衆通話起見，最近特訂定電局及郵局内設置公用電話辦法，通令通商大埠之郵電局，凡當地　有部辦市内或畏途電話者，應一律裝設公用電話，以便零售市内或長途電話。此項辦法最近期内卽可實現，嗣後民衆隨時隨地可以通話，必覺便利異常云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>好男兒不食僞國飯</h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>昨見報載，遼寗自衛軍總司令鄧鐵梅被捕後，四日經日軍千餘名押至瀋陽禁陸軍監獄内，由日軍一小隊監守，僞國官吏及日人震鄧名者紛紛往訪，鄧除與一二稍有人格者交談外，默不發言。入獄後已數日未食，日人送筵宴數桌，均置不食，謂好男兒不食僞國飯，對僞官吏直斥其事仇無恥，聞者均赧然俛避云。這眞可以使得我們聞而肅然起敬，繼而爲之漸愧無地的一條値得可歌可泣的寳貴消息。</p>
<p>中國民氣是久已消沉了，自從九一八以來，日本以砲火迫使整個中國向他屈服，當時雖也有一些激昻慷慨的學生，小市民，做出一些表示不屈事情，但不久也就完全消滅了，至於現在，抗日這名詞，差不多已完全聽不見，大家都似乎很安靜的過着被壓迫日子，淫靡，享樂，塞滿了每個都市，中國民氣如此消沉，中國是完全無希望的了。一般人都是如此觀察。其實完全是錯誤的。中國民氣何嘗是消沉呢？不獨不消沉，反是在暗地裏，在社會的核心裏，日益潛滋暗長，相應着外圍客觀事實的鞭策，而在益加激急抗進。如鄧鐵梅的激昻慷慨的誓不食僞國飯，這雖是他個人的行動，但從他的背後，我的就可立刻看到許許多多成千成萬的整個東北抗日民衆。</p>
<p>整個東北抗日民衆的抗日行動，不自今日始了，差不多自九一八以來，卽跟着帝國主義槍砲的壓迫，而開始了其空前的流血的鬥爭。這鬥爭至今日而達到更激烈更尖銳的階段。我們不要以爲久不見關於東北義勇軍們消息，就認爲東北民衆抗日力量已經消滅，這是錯誤的。</p>
<p>不要悲觀，中國反抗力量是不會被消滅的，而且也永遠不會消滅的。</p>
<h3>表姊</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>闊别了十年的表姊，這次在回家的時候忽然春到了·十年前在腦膜内表姊的身影和十年後的她已完全變成兩個人。我不禁暗暗地嘆息着：靑春易逝，表姊眞是老了呵！</p>
<p>記得在年輕時，她時常到我家中來住，那時她正十七八歲的少女，而我只有十歲左右。她長得頂好看，美麗有如一朶令人愛惜的將開放的百合花，在狠多女親戚中間，差不多沒有人比上她。自幼時人家便呌她做「美娘」。我也不知道她的我字直到現在還是仍然如前一樣呼她「美姊」。她對我眞够愛護，老是摸着我的頭髮，帶我一塊去玩，而我對她亦感非常溫柔可親。因爲她長的實在美，又沒有弟妹，單獨一個人，所以父母都十分珍惜她，看得同如掌上明珠一般，尤其是關於婚姻一件事，他們更是不輕易就遷就，一方面是希望爲兒子揀個配得上的對象，一方面却亦是不願她離開了身邊，因此一談到這回事，都說緩緩挑，緩緩挑。的延下去。</p>
<p>以後我離掉了家到外邊流浪，一直不曾回去，但不久間終於聽到表姊出嫁的消息了。</p>
<p>這次回家，表姊剛好也來家裏，使我們有了一個見面的機緣。然而表姊再不是往昔的表姊，她已做了在四個月孩子的母親了。臉上隠約地劃着狠多縐紋，笑着眉尖都打結。靑春底顏色全行退盡，一絲不留，少女的活潑也永遠和她隔絶。時間的積疊加上人事的磨難，使她消失了一切，使她很快地憔悴下來。一種人生的憂鬱與愁苦濃厚地表現在她的行動上，以及言談上，少女芳郁的時期夢一樣過去了。</p>
<p>全像是中年人母親型的表姊呵！</p>
<p>管理兒子和所有家庭瑣碎的負担都重重田壓在也的背膊，把她的感覺都麽折得異樣遲滯了。她簡直成爲了一架機械似的，從早上到夜間。横的豎的勞碌着，操作着，沒有一刻可以讓她休息。四五個孩子老是胡鬧着，不是吵食，便是是吵喝，不那個吵，便是這個哭，哄道了大的，少的又纒着，弄得手脚忙個不了。</p>
<p>每天，都是那樣麽苦到骨顯發麻。到了夜裏，整一天的疲勞感到困倦的不可支持了。就草草的躺在床上，預備舒適地睏一睏。可是孩子們又巴巴的嚷起來；要開水，要糖吃，如果她裝着不理，孩子更搥着母親的身體，一定非呌醒不可。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，表姊只得暫時到親戚處住住，躱避的安閑數天，而我的家便是她喜歡來，自已家裏的雜務一時是鬆去了的。但是孩子們的糾纒正是一</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>同帶了來。</p>
<p>早上，看見表姊撇開了胸膛，露出乳喂一個不滿年的嬰兒，一邊在對着鏡子響裝，大約是躺在屈着的膝盤上不舒服，雖然有得喝，可還作怪，拚命的攅動着，母親沒法，放下手，抱起來搖了幾搖，另塞了一雙乳子往孩子嘴裏，孩子仍是嘶着咽喉哭個不停。於是表姊氣惱了，在孩子的屁股上用力揍了幾下，駡着；</p>
<p>！　種，哭死你的，早死早乾凈。</p>
<p>！表姊，孩子懂得什麽，打也不中用，緩緩騙他好了。我在旁邊輕聲地說着。</p>
<p>！你不知道的，這些死短命，好像是前世去的寃仇，故意來討債似的我眞是麻煩够了。</p>
<p>這樣地，我可發覺了表姊的性子大大的改變。在平常時每逢着心境惡劣不過時，那個孩子正好又來歪纒，她便抓住着摜了幾隻巴掌，似乎籍此出出氣，母親們常常喜歡如此的，受不了丈夫或是婆婆的氣，而又無從發洩，就把孩子做出氣調，表姊也有了這種脾氣啊！</p>
<h3>荆棘</h3>
<p>— 言危</p>
<p>學步都是荆棘啊，這又是一次體騐。</p>
<p>早晨，天是那樣地陰暗，正是梅雨時節，像要下雨的樣子。妻和我都沒有帶着雨具，又怕雨打濕了新衣，只揀了兩件隨便的衣服穿着，就從故鄉丨慈谿丨上了火車，動身到上海來。</p>
<p>在都市中養尊處優慣了的我們，經不起一個月來太陽光下的游處，皮膚早就黑了許多。因天天跑山的綠故，沒有多餘的工天半下來理髮，所以頭髮也長了好些。　依不舍地和這故鄕山水離别了，火車一輪輪地送我們越過村落，惘然地看那景物流移，禁不住有一種特殊的觸。</p>
<p>火車停在ＸＸ車站上，在蠭擁的人羣中，我們被擠出了車站。正要呌車子的時候，穿軍衣的兵士把我們截住了。　　兵士的臂上纒着多角形的徽章，驚心觸目地是肩頭掮看刀出銷的木槍，胸前更是什麽什麽的零雜東西，總之可以毁滅我們的可驚怖的武器。</p>
<p>兵士說：「打開來！」舉手一指。</p>
<p>在兵士的指揮下，我方始感覺到自已生命太渺小，纔想到武士要看我手上的行篋呢。肅然地，將帶着的一只挈篋放在地上，正在比時，武士又下令；</p>
<p>「快一點！」</p>
<p>驚慌着，急切到連鎖兒也打不開來，經過了一陣擾亂，總算打是打開了，可是兵士的氣色就不在好看，他潦草地翻去了衣服，文件書報都不關心，却把親戚送我們的幾包食物往返不已的細看。說一句商人化的話，恰如江西珠寳商觀看古董似的，他認爲最可疑的是一包剝了殼的桂圓肉。</p>
<p>「這是什麽？」</p>
<p>「桂圓肉！」</p>
<p>他似乎不大相信，拿出幾塊，命令我嘗了幾塊。看我沒有苦痛，他認爲有嘗試可能，也嚼了一些，可是嚼了有滋味就不得了，他抓了一大把送到嘴裏。　　我的公事完了，搜到了妻，妻也是一隻挈篋，早就預備打開了。</p>
<p>可是女人們的東西自然零碎些，他發見了寳藏，看了那件，又是那件，我有些光起火了。就鼓着勇氣：</p>
<p>「可否請你快一些，查出些什麽來！」</p>
<p>「你說什麽？」</p>
<p>我一看情形不對，忙不嚮了</p>
<p>不料妻篋中也有一件可疑之物，是一包中國陳藥，名曰辟瘟丹。</p>
<p>照例的受審問，我告訴了他，他又要呌我呌了，可是有一些爲難。我告訴他這是藥，他始終不加信認，這可難了。</p>
<p>「好，」這姿勢又不同，大槪意思是將此案保留，再尋别的吧。他又像獵犬似的亂尋了。</p>
<p>啊！武士的行爲中止了，那兒有一包信，其中一封信是一個朋友托一個大老轉交給我們的，他拿着信封看了一番，又指着大老名字，問我認識嗎？大槪他以爲大老可以轉交的信，這個人一定有些來歷，於是閉上挈篋，擲還辟瘟丹，說：「完了。」</p>
<p>狼狽地走出了車站。</p>
<p>舉步都是荆棘啊，這又是一次體騐</p>
<h3>粽話</h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>中國是野蠻民族，根本不知藝術是什麽，但是生米能够煮成熟飯之外，更能裹以棕箬，實以猪油夾沙，赤荳肉骨，做出多角形粽子其名的東西來；而粽子更以泗涇爲最著。節届端午，各大土產公司卽以粽子大王相號召，最富麗者，售價六元，鄕下人誤認上海是遍地黃金或者就是這類傳聞失實所致。但是立夏吃櫻桃靑梅，中秋吃月餅，端午吃粽子的習俗，前者還可說新貨上市，先吃爲快；後者着實有些神話無稽，就是龍舟競渡，也變爲多銷幾張門券的好廣告了。這顯明中國人的善於掮死人牌頭，試觀屍骨未寒，而遺著早已登龍有術了。</p>
<p>我自到了上海，下令禁止無意識的祭祀，所以判决罪名爲「滅祖宗」。當然，吃月餅，吃粽子這類有閑的口福，更不在吃飽了白米飯之後的賬内了。去歲端午，有位女友親送粽子數件，說是「端午不吃粽，老來嘸人送」的，她是個大學生論理應該比我多讀一點書，或者竟是合於科學化的原理，我就在午時三刻大啖了粽子一頓。但是據非科學的說：」積　防飢，養兒防老。一而粽子與兒子有同樣的效力，實是我有生以來所不知道的奥妙。</p>
<h3>父親死了後的孩子們</h3>
<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>孩子們對着近日母親的反常行爲有些懷疑；怨恨一好像母親的現在對待他們，並不如先前那樣溫柔，體貼。常使露出兇厲的目光來；假使是一件錯事，在先前這樣做了，並不會使母親如何憤怒！再不會像這麽拉起褲胯的下襟動手打。卽使把那件做錯了的事改糾正了或是敎訓了一頓，下次不能再這樣做；絶不如像現在動手的就打屁股！好像是怪純熟了的一個技術似的，經過了幾次的實習經騐過後。</p>
<p>孩子們在被一陣莫名的打過了後，哭了一陣，沒處訴苦！眼看母親又打扮得花枝招展的換上新衣出去了。臨走出房門，還重新再回進來，對了鏡子，搽上一回胭脂，又幾次凑近鏡面瞧上半天，似乎塗紅的兩塊，不大匀稱。感到掃興！</p>
<p>從鏡子的斜角間，望着兩個孩子却停了眼淚偷看着，不禁又張起了一把火趕前去，兩只手，領高了兩個拉長的耳朶。</p>
<p>！母親我們下次不······</p>
<p>其實孩子並不曾明瞭得，所以這次母親拉他耳朶的原因。</p>
<p>看這次母親眞個離開了大門，很遠很遠看不到影子！</p>
<p>兩個孩子掛着兩條蒸乾的眼淚，用手背掯過的　團烏痕。並肩坐了下來在　板凳上，大的伸過手去摸了摸小的那只被拉過的耳朶。</p>
<p>！弟弟，可還痛？小的沒有回答，又哭出聲來。連身子翻在大的懷里</p>
<p>！哥哥，我眞不相信，她是我們媽，我們親生的媽？</p>
<p>哥哥拉着了弟弟的手，那個掯過眼睛的烏黑手背。響不出什麽？不知在時麽時候，滾下一點眼淚在弟弟手背上。　　！啊，哥哥，你在哭！你耳朶還痛嗎。弟弟跳了起來！全忘掉自已的眼淚也還掛着。</p>
<p>我！不是耳朶痛！我在想，爲什麽爹爹死後，母親亦會對我們不好啦？難道爹爹死了，母親就應該可以打我們的；不然僅就爲了搬了一碗荳，而遭着這麽毒打！弟弟，你說，哥哥今年幾歲啦？昨天，張老伯告訴我，母親和前村的金阿四很親熱！就是那個滿臉雀班和麻子的吃烟阿四；她要求我們喚他娘舅，我爲了不情願喚他，又給母親扭起嘴唇一塊靑。那個人看來就惹厭！偏偏母親却和他好上了。</p>
<p>！哥哥，我們買手槍來開死他！</p>
<p>但是孩子們始終還沒有這麽胆量的！</p>
<p>在母親下嫁金阿四的消息公佈後，兩個孩子拖住母親的衣角不肯放，眼淚哭得像硼斷了的自來水龍頭。</p>
<p>張老看不過到金阿四那邊講情！允許把兩個孩子帶了來吧！那邊不答應！理由是自已孩子嫌着太多，不再須要再加兩個抽油瓶。</p>
<p>而母親的意思也凖定抛棄這兩個孩子；以三十元的代價，賣給了陳老爹看牛當雜作。</p>
<p>過後孩子們的影象，在母親的記憶中是忘懷而消失了。</p>
<h3>投稿須知</h3>

<h3>Memorial Oration by the Central Executive Committee to the Martyrs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party's memorial oration for the martyrs of the Military Academy reads: On this, the fifteenth day of June in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Central Military Academy, all officers, students, and staff have gathered together in joyous assembly. Remembering the martyrs, we solemnly conduct this sacrificial rite, a most grand ceremony. The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, with fragrant flowers and millet wine, offers this sacrifice to the spirits of all the martyrs: Alas, from ancient times, those who undertake great deeds and establish great achievements must have assistants who are like arms and hearts, pillars and beams, to maintain and support them together. Success is like the three thousand of Zhou Wu, and righteousness is like the five hundred of Tian Heng. Although their circumstances differed, their unity of purpose, their shared assistance, and their unwavering commitment were the same. Only our Premier Sun, following the times in revolution, lamented the incompleteness of the overall accomplishment and sought to consolidate the cadres. Thus, in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he skillfully selected talented individuals and founded this academy. Relying on the diligent efforts of those in charge of instruction and training, they achieved success within months. The following year, they launched the Eastern Expedition, and the year after that, the Northern Expedition, advancing bravely without hesitation, achieving victory wherever they went, and thus extinguishing rebellions and unifying the country. All of this was due to the unity of purpose and concerted efforts of our comrades from the Military Academy. In times of national crisis, however, worries and anxieties frequently arose. Year after year, troops were mobilized to maintain peace. Our comrades from the Military Academy took the lead in rushing to the front lines, participating in every battle without exception, breaking through enemy lines and crushing resistance without looking back. This allowed our weak and oppressed nation to muster its remaining strength and somewhat revitalize itself. Is its significance not great? Alas, since the founding of the Military Academy, the number of our officers, students, and staff who have dedicated themselves to national affairs to the point of death and injury is countless. Yet, those who fall but are followed by others, who persevere despite setbacks, who break their necks and shed their blood, who die nine times without regret, are inspired by the Premier's teachings and the Party's principles, which motivate their ambition and uplift their spirits. Now, with weeds and tares yet to be eliminated and foreign threats imminent, it is even more crucial that we unite our efforts to suppress tyranny, avenge our humiliations, strengthen our principles, improve our scholarship, temper our bodies, and sharpen our spirits. We must approach matters with loyalty, sincerity, and integrity, and maintain a strong and resolute spirit, doing our utmost to respond to events and alleviate crises. This is the responsibility of those who come after. The Book of Changes says, "Its ruin! Its ruin! It is tied to a clump of mulberry trees." Am I not of this kind of people? With whom shall I associate? These are the words that I wish to share with all those in the Party who are like arms and hearts. May the spirits of all the martyrs truly witness this. Accept this offering. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Memorial Oration to the Martyrs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Chung-cheng, President of the Central Military Academy, offers this memorial oration to the spirits of the academy's martyrs: On this, the fifteenth day of June in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the tenth anniversary of the founding of this academy, President Chiang Chung-cheng, respectfully leading all officers, students, and staff, offers this sacrifice to the spirits of the martyrs of this academy: Alas, ten years have passed since the founding of this academy. These ten years have been nothing but a history of hardship and struggle, a history of sorrow and heroic sacrifice. When this academy was founded in Whampoa, it was trapped on an isolated island, surrounded by enemies on three sides. All the comrades of the academy, numbering only a few hundred, were inspired by the spirit of the Premier and the resolute protection of Party Representative Liao, all vowing to be diligent and courageous and to take the implementation of the Three People's Principles as their responsibility. In the fourteenth year, during the Eastern Expedition, they led several thousand newly trained troops to quell the rebellions of Chen, Lin, Yang, and Liu. Unexpectedly, just as the battle in eastern Guangdong was achieving victory, the Premier departed from us and passed away. The base in Guangdong was just beginning to be established when Party Representative Liao was also assassinated by enemies. In the face of this immense shock and grief, our comrades from the academy became even more resolute in their efforts to fulfill the Premier's and the martyrs' unfinished aspirations. In the fifteenth year, the Central Government launched the Northern Expedition. In the course of two years, they fought across thousands of miles and shed blood in more than ten provinces. Among the revolutionary armies, comrades from our academy served as their cadres. After the Party unified the country, the Red bandits caused trouble internally, and powerful neighbors pressed from outside. The clouds of war spread across the northern frontier, and the threat extended to the south of the Yangtze River. In suppressing internal rebellions and resisting external aggression, in charging into enemy lines, comrades from our academy served as the backbone. Our academy's history of revolutionary struggle spans ten years, and the comrades from the academy who have sacrificed themselves for the revolution number in the thousands. Since the Eastern Expedition, in all the revolutionary battles, I have served as the commander, and the comrades from our academy have all followed me onto the battlefield, vowing to share life and death. Whenever the fighting became intense, seeing bullets flying horizontally and treasured swords about to break, the terrible suffering of my beloved comrades, or even their abandoning me to pass away forever, my heart ached, and tears fell. How can I describe the sorrow? It is not that we do not know that we fight for principles, that we desire something greater than life, and that if the revolution succeeds, the spirit of the group will endure forever. However, the feelings are unavoidable when one has discussed and studied together with comrades, spending day and night together, as close as flesh and blood. Alas, the reason why the martyrs treated life lightly, facing sharp blades with courage and sacrificing themselves as if returning home, was for the sake of the Three People's Principles, for the sake of the Party and the nation. If the Three People's Principles cannot be fully realized one day, if the Party cannot be strengthened one day, if the nation cannot achieve freedom and equality one day, then even I and the comrades who come after cannot fulfill the wishes of the martyrs. Ten years have passed in a flash. Looking back at our achievements, there are still many regrets. Offering this sacrifice to the martyrs today only increases the boundless pain in my heart. What I vow to do is to lead the comrades who come after, to endure hardship and self-refinement, to dedicate all my heart and strength, to complete the work of those who have passed away, and to fulfill the ambitions of those who have passed away, so that I may be worthy of the Premier, Party Representative Liao, and all the martyrs. Alas, on this day of sacrifice, the past and present comrades of our academy are gathered here. The events of the past ten years are as vivid as yesterday. If the spirits of the martyrs are aware, they will surely feel as if flesh and blood have been reunited, and they will witness once again the joy of gathering together to discuss etiquette and warfare. But for us, the appearances and voices of the martyrs are gone, and we can only see them in the deep of night, in our thoughts and memories. Is this not sorrowful? Alas, woe is me! Accept this offering. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Opening of Traffic Between Beiping and Shenyang; The Time of Realization Still Awaits</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The time of realization for the issue of opening traffic between Beiping and Shenyang has not yet been decided. The date of Yin Tong's return north has not yet been confirmed. Huang Fu is scheduled to enter Beijing from Shanghai on the 17th to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss everything, and then go north. It is estimated that he will arrive in Beiping by the end of this month. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Continental Press news. The plan and details for opening traffic between Beiping and Shenyang have now been largely completed. Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, is taking it back north. One party widely rumored that this traffic plan and details must be signed by the responsible parties on both the Chinese and Japanese sides and submitted to the competent authorities of their respective countries for approval before it can be entrusted to a third party to handle. It is also heard that the so-called third method is only a regulation in principle. The representatives of this third method are: (1) organizing an international travel agency; (2) organizing a Beiping-Shenyang transportation company; (3) the Oriental Transportation Association establishing a transportation branch. The first one is Yin Tong's proposal, and the latter two were proposed by Usami, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, and Ota Kyusaku, the director of the Fengtian Railway Bureau. It is currently unknown which one will be adopted in the future. However, general observations indicate that the method of an international travel agency is more appropriate. According to transportation industry news, Usami, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, and Ota Kyusaku, the director of the Fengtian Railway Bureau, the Japanese representatives negotiating the opening of traffic, are now preparing for the opening of traffic. The Shahekou Railway Factory operated by the South Manchuria Railway is creating vehicles, and the ones that have already been created are 11 passenger cars and 24 freight cars.

<p>(Nanjing) Although Huang Fu's nasal disease has been cured, he still has no intention of returning to his post. Chiang and Wang intend to summon him to Nanjing to comprehensively discuss plans for stabilizing North China. It is also heard that regarding issues such as opening traffic, opening postal services, and establishing customs, the opening of traffic between Beiping and Shenyang has only been discussed in principle, and whether it will be implemented depends on the situation. The issue of opening postal services is still far from reality and has not been studied yet. As for establishing customs checkpoints at various passes of the Great Wall, this is a necessary plan by the Ministry of Finance for preventing smuggling and has nothing to do with the Japanese puppets. It is rumored that it was discussed with the Japanese puppets. The outside world does not understand the inside story, causing false rumors. In fact, it has not been completely decided yet. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is heard that Yin Tong boarded the Japanese ship Dalian Maru at the Huishan Wharf in Shanghai on the 11th and returned north by sea.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Situation in the Northeast Under Violent Control</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from western Rehe talked about how the Japanese are actively promoting opium cultivation. The Japanese designate a certain household to plant opium on a certain amount of land, and the tax is reduced. If the opium cultivation exceeds the previous year in the following year, there will also be rewards. Many farmers are lured by the profit. The Japanese have established loan offices in important places in Rehe Province to forcibly lend money to local residents, with varying amounts, using real estate deeds as collateral, with monthly interest rates of three or four percent, to be paid monthly. Any delay will result in arrest and imprisonment. If they refuse to borrow money, the Japanese regard them as wealthy households and will inevitably suffer unexpected losses. Dolun was occupied by the Japanese as an initial plan to invade Inner Mongolia. The Japanese are actively building roads on the border between Rehe and Chahar to facilitate the transportation of military vehicles. The main road of Heidaziying in the 24th district from Chengde to Guyuan is an important base in military terms. When the road was repaired last year, the puppet county magistrates of the various counties sent laborers. Several village chiefs in a certain place were forcibly buried alive by the Japanese for failing to do their jobs properly. The situation was extremely tragic. Residents on the border between Rehe and Chahar are under the brutal abuse of the Japanese and all hate them very much. Residents of Xin Yuan in Duolun still contact Guyuan County to handle tax deeds and other matters. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>American Missionary Ingle Dies Tragically After Being Killed by Bandits; Has Been in China for 46 Years; Devoted His Life to Medical Affairs; The 70-Year-Old Man Still Fought the Bandits; Only Five Yuan in Cash Was Robbed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The American missionary Ingle, who was vacationing in the Western Hills with his family, was killed by bandits last night. This news shocked Pingcheng this morning. Mr. Ingle was 75 years old and had been in China for 46 years. He devoted his life to medical affairs, especially surgery, and had written several medical books in Chinese. Although Mr. Ingle had retired, he still had close ties with the Chinese Language School and had written textbooks for foreigners learning Chinese. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) American missionary Ingle went to his residence in the Western Hills with his wife and several grandchildren yesterday afternoon, intending to return to Beiping tonight. The residence is in a rather remote area, but there had never been any bandit incidents. The tragedy occurred around 12:30 AM when the whole family had fallen asleep. Suddenly, four or five bandits broke in through the window and pointed their guns at Mr. Ingle's head, forcing him to hand over the cash. The language spoken by the bandits was difficult to distinguish, indicating that they were from elsewhere. The children, hearing the sound of bandits breaking into the house, ran to Mr. Ingle's bedroom and climbed onto his bed. The bandits held a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other, pointing the gun at people's faces and ordering them not to move. However, for the safety of his wife and grandchildren, Mr. Ingle suddenly got up and grabbed a bandit, pushing him against the wall. During the struggle, the bandit's hand holding the gun was freed, and he fired at Mr. Ingle, one bullet hitting his left arm and one hitting his head. After the second bullet was fired, Mr. Ingle fell to the ground and died. The 70-year-old cook was also imprisoned in another room by the bandits. The bandits then searched the house and took two pairs of glasses, a watch, and five yuan in cash before leaving. After the bandits left, Mrs. Ingle went to the train station at dawn and notified her daughter, Mrs. Pratt, in Beiping by telephone. Mr. Ingle's remains were transported back to Beiping this morning. People in Beiping, both Chinese and foreign, mourned the missionary's death. This morning, the American Embassy has notified the Chinese authorities of this case, and the authorities have promised to arrest the perpetrators and punish them and to protect foreigners near Beiping. After Mrs. Ingle returned to Beiping, American Ambassador Johnson immediately went to offer condolences, and some Chinese officials also went to offer condolences. It is reported that the bandits robbed four shops in a nearby village last night. It is also reported that Mr. Ingle went to the residence in the Western Hills to get blankets for his grandchildren who were going to Beidaihe. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Pirates Rob and Are Captured at Beidaihe; Gunboat Captures 22 Pirates; Norwegian Merchant Fights Bravely Against the Bandits</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said on the 15th that pirates were discovered on the beach in Beidaihe on the 13th. After a fierce suppression by our coastal defense soldiers, in addition to those killed on the spot, a total of 17 were captured alive. They are currently held in the coastal defense department and will be transferred to Tianjin for interrogation and trial within days. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China Star received a telephone call from its Beidaihe reporter, describing the capture of pirates. It is said that 22 pirates came from outside the Great Wall to Qinhuangdao, seized three fishing boats, and attempted to seize a grain ship outside the Beidaihe lighthouse. While fighting with the grain ship, two fishing boats took the opportunity to escape. The people on the boats landed in Beidaihe and telephoned the Qinhuangdao Customs authorities. The authorities immediately sent a patrol boat to the scene to attack the pirates. The pirates stubbornly refused to surrender, so the patrol boat opened fire. Later, 11 pirates were captured. Before the patrol boat arrived, Mr. Billen, manager of a Norwegian construction company in Shanghai, saw that the ships were acting suspiciously and went to the beach with a knife and stick. Although the numbers were unequal, Mr. Billen was still able to repel six pirates and cut off their escape route. When the patrol boat arrived, they were all captured. Three pirates tried to escape by jumping into the water, and two of them disappeared. When the patrol boat opened fire, one of the boat bosses was killed by the pirates, and one of the pirates' bodies was washed ashore. Another pirate was seriously wounded by a bullet and is unlikely to survive. (Reuters dispatch, 15th) (Tianjin) A confirmed report received this afternoon from Beidaihe states that the pirates were captured not by a customs patrol boat but by a Chinese gunboat. A total of 19 pirates were captured. At the time, fishermen reported to the police, and two policemen immediately notified the gunboat, which led to the capture. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Saving the Crisis of the Spinning Industry</h3>
<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>China's textile industry is the earliest to take on a modern industrial form, a common characteristic of emerging industrial nations and a universal phenomenon of global progress. However, since the global economic panic of 1929, China's economy has been pressured externally by the raging tide of the depression and internally by the limited market. Outward exports have been hampered by tariff barriers, while domestically there has been intense competition from imported goods. Therefore, even though the industry has done its best to implement various measures such as reducing work and limiting production quantities, it has ultimately failed to achieve any effect and has only deteriorated further. The hope for rising yarn prices remains elusive, and the stockpiles in warehouses remain difficult to clear. Thus, the crisis of the entire cotton yarn industry has intensified. If there are no practical and appropriate relief measures, the future will face the same fate as the silk industry.</p>
<p>However, if we want to discuss relief, we must first explore the source of the yarn industry's crisis. From the perspective of the overall economic situation, every industry in the world shows signs of decline. The textile industry, such as Lancashire in England, is also experiencing unusual decline. China is naturally no exception. But the main reason is still the increasingly shrinking yarn market. Since 1929, countries around the world have leaned toward economic self-sufficiency, minimizing the import of foreign products and increasing domestic exports. From the home country to the colonies, all are trying to manage the consumption of our cotton products. Although it cannot reach the world, there is still room to maneuver in the Nanyang region. However, recently, it has been affected by the poor local market and by the intense pressure of Japanese products. As a result, overseas consumption has been reduced to zero. At the same time, foreign products have invaded our domestic market, causing us to lose our superior position in the country. Moreover, foreigners invest and set up factories in China, taking advantage of their sophisticated technology and our cheap labor. All geographical advantages are shared with us, and they have taken the lead in industrial operation, product production, and transportation. This is another main cause of the crisis.</p>
<p>Is it possible that China's yarn factories, with the convenience of low labor costs and the benefit of local production and consumption, cannot compete with others? The output of yarn factories is affected by negative political and economic factors, such as heavy taxes and excessive transportation costs, which are enough to make China's cotton yarn lag behind foreign products. In times of better economic conditions, it can barely be maintained. Once external forces strike, it will immediately be in trouble. In addition, although many of those who operate yarn factories in China are able to use modern methods, they still follow past habits. It is feared that some factories are bureaucratic. Such factories have huge expenditures and poor work performance, and their output is even below average. They cannot compete with strong enemies in peacetime, let alone in this era of intensified economic competition. For now, the spinning industry must be thoroughly aware of the current crisis in order to save it. First, it must seek rationalization of operations and eliminate accumulated habits. Second, it must carefully investigate the relationship between domestic and foreign markets and strive to recover the lost market in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>China is originally a vast world market, sufficient to absorb huge quantities of commodities. Our industry has plenty of room for development. But why has the entire national economy been so devastated? The lives of the masses are in a state of upheaval and ruin. Therefore, whether we want to seek a temporary small-scale prosperity in the economic sector today or find a way out for an industry, we must first pay attention to the state of the entire national economy in order to determine the strategy to deal with it. If the yarn industry wants to develop consumption at home and this type of consumption's expansion, it must first seek to stabilize the national economy and increase the consumption of general daily necessities. Then the yarn industry will naturally benefit. Moreover, China's production and consumption should be mainly based on the vast majority of farmers. Actively revitalizing the rural economy is also indirectly creating a market for the cotton yarn industry.</p>
<h3>Fascist Leaders Compete to Lead the World; Reconstructing Europe is an Urgent Task; The Venice Talks Are Secret; Reportedly Agreed to Help Germany Achieve Military Equality in Exchange for a Truce on the Austrian Issue; Yesterday Morning, They Reviewed the Pan-Fascist Party Army; Afternoon, A Conference on Gunboats</h3>
<p>Venice Today, Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler met for the first time, speaking in German for two hours and twenty-five minutes. No third party participated. They explained their mutual political attitudes to each other. This conversation was purely an exchange of information. The two leaders will continue their talks tomorrow when they cruise on the waters of Venice. Conclusions can only be reached after a second talk in the evening. The press believes that since Germany and Poland have been able to reconcile on the Danzig issue, the Austrian issue may also be resolved peacefully. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Venice The two giants of Italy and Germany are meeting here today. Prime Minister Mussolini acted swiftly and began negotiations with Chancellor Hitler. He is urging the German Chancellor to return to Geneva in order to fully implement the Four-Power Pact. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Venice The nature of the talks between the Italian and German Chancellors remains strictly confidential and has not been disclosed. According to rumors, the Italian Prime Minister intends to allow Italy to mediate so that Germany can honorably return to the League of Nations and obtain military equality. The Italian Prime Minister will ask Germany for a truce on the Austrian issue as a reward.</p>
<p>Venice After reviewing the Pan-Fascist Party Army this morning, Mussolini and Hitler jointly attended a banquet hosted by the Italian government. After the banquet, the two prime ministers will take a speedboat to the village of Murano by the lake to begin their second political consultation. A welcome rally will be held in St. Mark's Square tonight, and Mussolini is expected to deliver a speech. It is predicted that this speech will be a major political event. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Venice This afternoon, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler will meet again on a gunboat. The boat will cruise outside Lido, and another 20 warships will be distributed nearby.</p>
<h3>The First Meeting of the Two Leaders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the two dictators met at the Villa Pisani after lunch to discuss important European affairs. It lasted two and a half hours, and there was no third person in the room, so the true nature of the conversation is not expected to be leaked. This is Hitler's first trip abroad since taking office as Chancellor and also his first meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>
<h3>The Content of the Conversation is Kept Secret</h3>
<p>There is no news about the conversation, so the general public is very concerned about whether the two dictators have reached an agreement. They both seem to admire each other. When they shook hands, it lasted a long time and their expressions were sincere. The conversation was in German, as Mussolini is also proficient in this language.</p>
<h3>Like the Triumphant Return of Ancient Heroes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when Hitler and Mussolini entered Venice together, it was like the triumphant return of two heroes of the ancient republic. The magnificent scenery of the Middle Ages was seen again today. When Hitler landed from the plane, Mussolini immediately gave the Fascist salute, and Hitler returned the National Socialist Party salute. The two then spoke in German for a few minutes. Then, they boarded a small boat and entered Venice along the canal, followed by countless small boats, like a long snake advancing. Upon arriving in the ancient city, the Italians enthusiastically cheered for their Prime Minister, while the Germans gathered outside the grand hotel where Hitler was staying and cheered "Long live Hitler." The authorities took strict precautions to protect this distinguished guest and stationed police and soldiers to guard the hotel.</p>
<h3>The Scheduled Program Has Been Changed</h3>
<p>The scheduled program has been slightly changed. Mussolini did not spend the night at the Villa Pisani but stayed at the luxurious hotel in Lido, which is a popular place in the summer but is not yet open. It is said that the two prime ministers only exchanged opinions yesterday, and a decision may be made during today's meeting. Last night, Mussolini went to the grand hotel to return Hitler's visit. The two then walked out side by side, and their relationship seemed very harmonious.</p>
<h3>Involves the Issue of Austrian Independence</h3>
<p>Political sources in Vienna now believe that Hitler will be more accommodating to Mussolini's views on the issue of Austrian independence.</p>
<h3>Lanterns on the Water Welcome the Distinguished Guests</h3>
<p>A lantern festival was held on the Grand Canal last night, with 200 illuminated boats participating, which was very grand and showed the intention of welcoming distinguished guests.</p>
<h3>Venice is Heavily Guarded</h3>
<p>Now, anyone entering the grand hotel where Hitler and others are staying must obtain a pass from the authorities and be admitted based on the pass. Those without passes are prohibited from entering. Hidden cannons are placed around the port of Venice, and two machine guns are placed on the watchtowers, guarded day and night. The strictness of the security is evident. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Closely Monitor</h3>
<p>(London) Political circles here are closely monitoring the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. Newspapers have published long articles commenting on the matter, calling it a historical meeting. The Morning Post said that Mussolini hoped to eliminate the dangers of the global arms race after the failure of the Disarmament Conference. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times' Venice dispatch today claimed that the meeting between the Italian and German Chancellors was welcomed because it told the world that Germany was not isolated in Europe. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always held the belief that European peace can only be guaranteed by actions based on the basic principles of the Four-Power Pact. Even the Far East situation has caused unnecessary disputes because the major European powers cannot resolve their differences. The general Italian population still believes that Mussolini's plan to restore commercial prosperity in Central Europe is the only feasible solution and that it should both preserve Austria's integrity and give Germany some of the political influence and commercial benefits it deserves. It is hoped that Mussolini can persuade Hitler to adopt a friendly attitude towards Austria, and Mussolini may provide the German Chancellor with new assistance on the issue of military equipment. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers have expressed deep interest in the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. One newspaper said that there may be nothing to hide in the meeting, and the topics of discussion will not go beyond the European situation. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Newspaper Opinions: Both Countries Do Not Wish to Sign Any Treaties, Hoping Four-Power Cooperation Will Benefit European Peace</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers tonight reported that the meeting between Chancellor Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini was not a signal of a sudden turn in German foreign policy. Chancellor Hitler's trip to Italy will not cause political upheaval in foreign countries, as there are no plans to sign any formal treaties in Venice. Hitler and Mussolini merely want to discuss all complex political issues. For example, the fault for the unresolved Austrian issue lies with Austria. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome. The Rome News published an article today, expressing the enthusiastic welcome for the visit of German Chancellor Hitler. The newspaper said, "Mr. Hitler is not only a distinguished guest from a neighboring country who should be given the highest honor and the warmest welcome, but he is also a person who controls destiny. He has an unstoppable spirit and unwavering confidence, so he can make the people of the whole country sincerely embrace him and recast Germany, uniting with the national socialist banner." The newspaper continued, saying that it is especially meaningful that the two leaders have chosen this time to meet, because the recent passage of the disarmament conference resolution is of no benefit to the European situation, and no matter what kind of resolution is to be effective for a long time, maintain European peace, and protect the future of Europe, it must have Germany's participation. This is now an unquestionable fact. Therefore, the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini today is of great importance. The chaos in the European diplomatic community can be temporarily calmed down. Germany's return to Geneva is a permanent issue, and it is difficult to find a suitable solution unless it is based on justice and humanity. Only Benito Mussolini can say a word to clarify the European situation and promote world peace and cooperation. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>The Roman Tribune welcomed Chancellor Hitler, saying that Fascist Italy recognizes the historical status requested by Germany and respects Chancellor Hitler as the leader of the liberation movement in Germany. The liberation completed by Hitler is a part of the reconstruction of Europe. This kind of transformation alone is enough to restore Europe's spirit of guiding the world, and this spirit is also what Mussolini advocates. Those who oppose Mussolini and Hitler must observe their meeting from this point of view. The urgent task in Europe is for countries to have stable and responsible governments in order to cope with our problems. The Italian Daily News stated that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini is a manifestation of the power of peace and clearing up chaos. The European situation is now very difficult and full of crises, such as the failure of disarmament, the revival of the arms race, the rise of bloc politics, and the hope of suppressing extremists to prolong the economic panic, etc. Therefore, stability is impossible. Mussolini opposes bloc politics and is loyal to the cooperation method of the Four-Power Pact. The Four-Power Peace Pact is the ideal cornerstone of European order and peace.

<h3>Austrian Border Violence: National Socialists Temporarily Lie Low</h3>
<p>Vienna. Today, the terrorist acts of National Socialists in Austria have temporarily stopped. Generally, people say that because German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are now meeting in Venice, the National Socialist cadres in the German city of Salzburg have ordered their followers to temporarily restrain themselves.

<h3>France Increases Expenses to Strengthen National Defense: The Government Submits to the House of Representatives for Discussion; Prime Minister Doumergue Recalls the Lessons of the European War, Saying That He Cannot Sit Back and Watch Neighboring Countries Grow Their Wings; The Socialist Party's Motion to Postpone Discussion Is Rejected</h3>
<p>(Paris) On March 10 this year, the government submitted a draft law on national defense expenditures to the House of Representatives, with a total expenditure of 2,980,000,000 francs for the army, navy, and air force. Later, because the border defense project was to be completed quickly and construction encountered difficulties, it was increased to 3,120,000,000 francs. This case was fully approved by the House of Representatives Finance Committee on June 6 by 22 votes to 12. Today, the House of Representatives met to discuss this case. The orthodox socialist party first raised a preliminary question. The government proposed a vote of confidence to show its opposition. The House of Representatives finally rejected the socialist party's proposal by a majority of 472 votes to 125. At this point, the rapporteur stood up to report, saying that the government's bill included three items: (1) Construction of border defense projects, (2) Construction of naval liquid fuel storage facilities, (3) Allowing the Air Force to act in conjunction with the Army and Navy. Army Minister General Petain explained from a technical point of view the necessity of disbursing funds to protect the safety of residents. The Socialist Party also requested that the national defense expenditure case be postponed for discussion. Prime Minister Doumergue strongly opposed it. In the end, the Socialist Party's postponement proposal was rejected by a majority of 459 votes to 125. Prime Minister Doumergue gave a speech, recalling past lessons, saying that before 1914, he was responsible for renovating fortresses in the areas of Nancy and the Gomuz Mountains. During the war, that place never fell into the hands of the enemy. The Prime Minister also said that past history, in short, is "We French were attacked, but we also struggled to defend ourselves. The past of the European War is like this." Since the end of the European War, France has shortened the length of military service, while foreign countries have secretly reorganized their military equipment at a rapid pace. The disarmament conference is working in Geneva, but some countries believe that it is of no value. In October 1932, the current German Chancellor sent an open letter to former Prime Minister von Papen, saying that international conferences only ratify what has already been done, and said, "Germany's rearmament or France's reduction of armaments, in our view, is the same thing. In conclusion, rearmament lies in Germany's own efforts and cannot be sought from Geneva. Once Germany's military equipment is completed, the situation will be a fait accompli. What can the international community do to me? Otherwise, it is difficult to hope for the recognition of the disarmament conference." This is the German side's argument. Therefore, it is not France that considers the "disarmament conference meaningless." Doumergue strongly stated that if France sits back and watches Germany's rearmament without taking precautions, France will be too late to regret it when a strong neighbor has grown its wings. Therefore, the government advocates that the discussion of the national defense expenditure case should not be delayed. Moreover, Germany has recently increased military spending and expanded its armaments. Doumergue concluded that if the national defense expenditure case is extended, he will take responsible actions based on his obligations. The audience applauded enthusiastically, except for the far left. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>If Disarmament Fails, Britain Seeks Its Own Security, Hoping Germany Will Return to Geneva: MacDonald's Election Speech</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald delivered a speech to voters today, saying that as a result of recent talks in Geneva, there has been no significant progress on the issues of security and disarmament. He believes that all countries should earnestly assist in the solution of the disarmament issue within the scope of not harming security. The British government has always advocated disarmament among countries, and this purpose has never changed. If other countries cannot follow suit, then Britain, although it will not join the arms race, will ultimately ensure its own security. MacDonald went on to express his regret over Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference, saying that the reason for Germany's move is still unclear. Finally, the Prime Minister hopes that a disarmament convention can be concluded and applied to European countries. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald said in a speech to the public in the Han district today that we hope Germany will give us more support and contribute to the disarmament issue. Germany has the power to do this, only if it makes all countries in the world not doubt its policies. Among the European countries, Britain will feel the great difficulty of fulfilling its obligations when war breaks out. Britain will continue to work for disarmament. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy to Hold Large-Scale Exercises This Summer</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy has decided to hold large-scale naval exercises in the seas off Kyushu, Korea, and Taiwan from the beginning of August.

<p>(Tokyo) Navy Vice Officer Iwamura issued a statement saying that this year's naval exercise will be held during the hot summer and typhoon season, and will be supervised by Admiral Fushimi-no-miya. Foreign navies have all their warships participating in exercises, but due to budget constraints in the Japanese Navy, half of the warships stay in naval ports. Only the annual large-scale exercise can make up for this shortcoming. (Japan Union News, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The authorities officially announced today that a large-scale naval exercise will be held around Japan's mainland and the seas around Kyushu, Korea, and Taiwan, starting in August and ending in October, supervised by Navy Chief of Staff Fushimi-no-miya, with a total of 180 large and small warships and more than 200 aircraft participating in the exercise.

<h3>Soviet Union Establishes New Airfield in North Sakhalin Island, Japan Attaches Great Importance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a telegram received from a certain place stated that the airfield that the Soviet Union started building in Katangli, North Sakhalin Island, has now completed all the projects and various equipment. Recently, it will implement regular aviation in order to connect with the Soviet mainland. This route must also be connected with Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. At the same time, Japan's northernmost aviation rights will be stimulated in fact, so the general public believes that this matter is worth considering. (Japan Union News, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Russian government has recently announced that it will start air transportation between Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk from the 16th, and its route starts from Vladivostok, passes through the North Pacific, and reaches Petropavlovsk, a key location on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the East, which can be connected to the Alaska air route in the United States in the future.

<h3>Airfield in the Middle of the Atlantic Ocean Begins to Be Used, Located on Noranha Island</h3>
<p>(Paris) The first airfield in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, located on Noranha Island, began to be used today. The famous French aviator Mermoz's large plane, the Rainbow, flew from Natal, Brazil, today to refuel there. The island is 125 miles from the eastern end of Brazil, one mile wide, and about five miles long. It has little to do with world commerce. Although many ships see it, few visit it. The island is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and is a volcanic rock with trees and good scenery. There is a small farm on the top of the island. It was first discovered by Captain Noranha in 1503, so it is named after him. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>German Propaganda Minister Visits Pilsudski, Places a Wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier: Polish Newspapers' Suspicion of Germany Is Difficult to Eradicate</h3>
<p>Warsaw. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived here yesterday. Today, General Pilsudski received him in a private capacity. Foreign Minister Beck and German Ambassador to Poland Motz were present. They talked for 50 minutes before parting. Goebbels then went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Poland to place a wreath in front of the tomb to pay his respects. Polish President Moscicki is now away from the capital, taking a summer vacation at the Spala summer villa, so Goebbels's visit to the Presidential Palace was not granted an audience. He registered his name in the guest book. It is heard that Goebbels is afraid that someone will plot against him, so news about his itinerary is not accurate in order to avoid accidents and ensure safety. Today, military police were densely stationed near the German embassy and on the main roads in the capital, and security was tight. When Goebbels paid tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, idle people were driven away from the square in front of the tomb, and a large team of police stood around to protect him. All newspapers remained silent about Goebbels' visit and did not make any comments. The right-wing newspapers mostly recalled Germany's previous demands on Poland, but they cannot help but wonder whether they will now sincerely abandon all demands. (Note: Germany's demands on Poland are the return of the Corridor and the provinces of Posen and Upper Silesia.) The ABC newspaper said, "Goebbels once declared that Germany will reach out to its former enemies to make peace, but what is hidden in the other hand? The secret contained in this second hand is the mystery of the relationship between Germany and other countries." In addition, the socialists and Jews here are very agitated, because these people regard Goebbels' visit as a provocative action in the world's second-largest cluster of Jews.

<h3>International Labor Conference: Japanese Representative Defends Dumping Policy; General Assembly Passes 40-Hour Workweek Draft</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, when the International Labor Bureau met in Geneva, Japanese government representative Yoshisaka spoke to defend Japan and refuted the accusations of social dumping. This morning's meeting continued to discuss the Labor Bureau's Director's report. The Japanese representative claimed that Japanese trade in 1929 and the years before the economic decline was greater than it is now, but no one has paid attention to this. Japan is working hard to restore prosperity, but to this day, all the results are not enough to absorb a small part of the unemployed. The Labor Bureau Director's report compares 1931 with 1933, which is actually inappropriate, because 1931 was an unusual year. He believes that 1929 should be used as the standard. According to 1933, Japanese world trade only accounted for 3.19% of world trade. Japanese export trade only accounted for 3.13% of world exports. Japan's imports are more than exports. Japan buys many raw materials and manufactured goods from foreign countries, which greatly helps the recovery of world trade. If Japan is forced to reduce its purchases of foreign goods, the world will suffer a major disadvantage. Japan did not use manpower to control currency. The depreciation of the Japanese yen was natural. If it is not allowed to depreciate, it will be manpower control. Finally, the Japanese representative thanked the International Labor Bureau for publishing the facts about Japan's industrial situation, and said that Japan's industrial situation is not worse than that of some European countries.

<h3>British House of Commons Questions Reform of the Shanghai Special Court: Eden Says He Has Obtained Sufficient Information; The Government Will Not Issue Any New Instructions for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Eden said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Conservative MP Lyne that the British government has obtained very sufficient information about the reforms required by the Shanghai Special District Court. British Ambassador to China Maude will continue to collect information whenever there is an opportunity. Foreign Secretary Simon does not want to issue any new instructions on this reform for the time being. Foreign Secretary Simon later said in response to a question from a member of parliament that the British government is well aware of Australian Deputy Prime Minister Latham's mission to visit the Far East. He believes that members of Congress should also congratulate Latham on the success of this trip. Latham's mission is very valuable to both Australia and Britain, and has now created a result that promotes good relations between Britain and countries in the Far East. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Germany Announces Suspension of Debt Payments: Creditor Countries Discuss Countermeasures; Bank for International Settlements Protests</h3>
<p>(London) The creditor countries regard the German National Bank's announcement of suspending the payment of various debts for six months as an arbitrary act and are greatly panicked. The most relevant countries, such as Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, are now discussing retaliatory measures. The British government stated at the beginning of debt negotiations that if Germany does not pay the Dawes and Young loans, the British government will take it seriously. What kind of actions the British government will take now has not yet been decided, but according to non-official predictions, the British government will adopt a kind of compulsory clearing house method. All Dawes and Young loans owed to Germany will be deducted from the German goods paid by Britain. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain agreed to make a statement on this matter in the House of Commons today. According to news from New York, the international banking community believes that if this suspension method is not revised, it will cause intense international disputes. After the National Bank announced the suspension of payments, the market price of German bonds fell. The Bank for International Settlements, the manager of the Young loan, held an emergency meeting and drafted a protest to be sent to the German government, opposing the suspension of interest payments on the Dawes and Young loans. It is heard that this protest leaves room for negotiation. According to today's news, the suspension of interest payments is a legal act of violating the Hague and Lausanne treaties. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Basel. The Bank for International Settlements will represent bondholders and reserve all the rights and interests of all bondholders, and will file a formal protest with the Berlin government, opposing the suspension of debt payments. The Bank for International Settlements' protest will announce that the suspension of debt payments violates the contracts under the Dawes and Young plans. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(New York) The financial community today hopes that Germany will find a way to continue paying the reparations under the Dawes and Young plans. Since the announcement of the suspension of payments, German bonds have become stronger, because although foreign exchange cannot be paid for debt temporarily, it will still be paid in marks. It is generally believed here that Germany is prepared to negotiate with various countries in order to find a solution for continuing debt payments. The New York market was not affected by Germany's suspension announcement, because it was expected here. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, well-informed sources predict that the French government will levy special taxes on various payments to Germany to benefit the French who hold Dawes and Young bonds. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(New York) Today, the New York Times' Washington dispatch stated that if other governments file a formal protest against Germany's decision to suspend debt payments, the United States may also join the protest. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Four Other Countries Suspend Payment of War Debts to the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) Italy, Poland, Romania, and Hungary today jointly notified the United States that they would suspend payment of war debts due tomorrow. Therefore, the debtor country front has become unified. France and Belgium have already sent payment suspension notifications to the United States. Italy owes the United States a total of US$2,407,677,000. There had never been any delays in payments before 1932. Italy has repaid US$98,839,859 in war debts. From 1933, it adopted the British method of only making credit payments in order to avoid the name of delays in payments. However, the Johnson Act passed by the US Congress has included this credit payment in the list of delays in payments. Poland owes a total of US$435,687,550 in principal and interest. By the end of 1932, Poland had paid a total of US$3,302,980 and has not paid a penny since then. Romania's total debt is US$122,506,260, of which US$4,761,945 has been paid. Hungary owes a total of US$4,693,240 and had paid US$478,466 by the time payments were suspended in 1932. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>British Trade War Against Japan (London Correspondence) Cannot Tolerate the Oppression of Japanese Goods Anymore; Must Immediately Fix the British Market</h3>
<p>The economic opposition between the United Kingdom and Japan has recently become increasingly serious. The United Kingdom must maintain its vested interests, especially its economic superiority in its autonomous colonies. However, Japan is unwilling to easily concede and withdraw from the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom. Moreover, after withdrawing, there is no suitable alternative location. Therefore, in order to coordinate this trade opposition relationship, representatives selected by the private sector held meetings locally, but ultimately broke down because they could not agree on the export volume and market division. Since that meeting broke down, Japan has further promoted its exports to the United Kingdom, while the United Kingdom has only engaged in defense. Another matter of great concern to the United Kingdom is that although the United Kingdom is an advanced country in imperialism, the spinning industry still occupies a very important position in the industry. However, from 1931 to 1933, during these three years, the number of spinning spindles in the United Kingdom decreased by 6,981,000 spindles. On the contrary, in Japan, it increased by 1,450,000 spindles. In comparison, how angry is the United Kingdom? Therefore, Secretary of Commerce Runciman issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"The British government has drawn the attention of the Japanese government to the problem of competition from Japanese goods for two years now. During this period, the export of Japanese goods has continued to increase. Therefore, the British government has had no choice but to come to the conclusion of trade self-defense. However, it does not itself believe that the commercial relations treaty of the past twenty years needs to be broken. However, the government believes that the silk tariff issue cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the Finance Minister has ordered the Tariff Advisory Committee to complete its report as soon as possible, and requests the authorities of colonies and protectorates outside Africa to implement appropriate quota systems. This quota system is the quota for the import of cotton products and rayon products from foreign countries. The number should be based on the average import volume from 1927 to 1931. The colonial governments should immediately formulate this necessary law. It is expected that the law requires that imports not hinder the implementation of the quota system and can take effect immediately (May 7). The West African colonies have already notified the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese treaty on May 16 of last year because the treaty hinders the preferences for British products. In the future, methods will be sought to restrict Japanese products. I am issuing this statement because I do not want to involve issues other than cotton products and rayon products, and the government believes that competition with Japan should not be limited to cotton products and rayon products. Therefore, it is considering what kind of tariff policy should be implemented on other commodities in the colonial market. As for the United Kingdom itself, the government considers the above-mentioned tariff law as a general countermeasure. No matter what proposals Japan puts forward on this issue, if a mutually agreed solution is proposed, (the United Kingdom) is certainly willing to give it deep consideration and attention."</p>
<p>This statement is no different from a commercial "ultimatum" to Japan. The United Kingdom still firmly insists that the average number of Japanese exports from 1928 to 1931 should be the base. Let us briefly examine the figures for these five years. The average Japanese cotton cloth exports to India in these four years was 436.869 thousand square yards, cotton cloth exports to the Straits Settlements were 32.818 thousand square yards, cotton cloth exports to Egypt were 99.454 thousand square yards, and to Australia were 15.285 thousand square yards. By 1933, India had increased to 451.803 thousand square yards, the Straits Settlements had increased to 95.769 thousand square yards, Egypt had increased to 21.351 thousand square yards, and Australia had increased to 54.997 thousand square yards. Other British territories, except Hong Kong, were mostly monopolized by Japanese cotton products. The United Kingdom, as the ruler, has retreated to a passive position. At this time, of course, it must try to counterattack as soon as possible. In terms of various autonomous colonies, there is indeed no clear expression of attitude at present, but Australia still harbors fear of Japan, Canada is even more heavily guarded, and India and Egypt are better to Japan only if there are exchange conditions (for example, requiring Japan to purchase Indian cotton). Most of the rest are transferred by the will of the United Kingdom itself. In short, the degree of opposition in the economic relationship between the United Kingdom and Japan is becoming increasingly profound. (May 9)</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppets Drafting Soldiers in the Northeast; Different Numbers Drafted from Each Village; Villagers' Cries Shake the Heavens</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: A person from Shenyang said that the Japanese recently ordered the puppet State Military and Political Department to implement conscription, starting from the southern part of the puppet Fengtian Province, divided into three types of villages: A, B, and C, to determine the number of draftees. Villages of type A with more than 100 households will draft 80 people, about one person from each household; villages of type B with more than 50 households will send one person per household, about 40 people; villages of type C with more than 20 households will draft 20 people, one person from each household. After conscription, they will be trained by Japanese instructors in the puppet garrison command headquarters in various places. It is said that this type of recruitment is in preparation for defense against Russia. Liaoyang, Liaozhong, Shenyang, and Xinmin counties have already started recruitment. A few days ago, 80 young men were drafted from Nanshuchihutun, Shenyang. Villagers, men, women, old and young, cried and wailed, seeing them off for more than ten miles and unwilling to part. The misery is indescribable. Rumors of a war between Japan and Russia have been spreading even more intensely recently. A branch of the volunteer army of two or three thousand people has also been found in the Andong area, elusive and moving unpredictably along the Anfeng Railway line, making it impossible for the Japanese army to grasp its whereabouts. According to the Japanese investigation, this volunteer army is determined to be led by Yang Yaojun, the former department of Li Du and Ding Chao. They were defeated in the Chulin Mishan last year and retreated to Russian territory. After being trained by the Soviet Union, they were ordered to return to the eastern region to serve as a separate detachment when a war between Japan and Russia occurs in the future. Therefore, the Japanese army is deeply afraid that this volunteer army will expand its power and disrupt the rear, and has sent aircraft to search for its headquarters everywhere. In Shenyang City, large and small businesses have been extremely desolate for half a year, and all merchants have no business to speak of. For example, Ruilinxiang shop in Brick City only sells two to three hundred yuan per day, less than one-fifth of what it was before the incident. The city is heavily guarded. Every day after 8 or 9 pm, the police hold large guns and set up posts on the main thoroughfares, inspecting passersby. After 10 pm, even with a pass or as a member of an organization, it is difficult to pass. The Japanese oppression of the people in southern Fengtian is increasing day by day. Tangmazhai, west of Liaoyang and Anshan, is the confluence of the Hunhe River and the Taizi River. There are more than ten agricultural villages clustered on both banks. Because the Taizi River floods every summer and autumn, the farmland on both banks is always destroyed by thousands of acres. Therefore, more than ten villages raised funds to build two dikes for flood prevention, which have been repaired by the villages over the years. On the 7th of this month, some Japanese and Koreans rented hundreds of acres of rice fields on the west bank of the river and established a rice field company, wanting to dig up the dikes and divert water for irrigation. The farmers in dozens of villages, because their lives and properties are at stake, came forward to stop them. The Japanese refused to listen and continued to dig. The villagers were furious and gathered more than 4,000 people to protect the dikes, living on the dikes day and night, with food and drink delivered by women. The Japanese and Koreans ran to the Japanese army in Liaoyang, saying that the villagers were anti-Manchu. A large team was dispatched and opened fire on the farmers in several rows, killing dozens of people. The villagers remained united and did not disperse. The Japanese army had no choice but to capture several people, designated them as representatives, and ordered everyone to disperse, but the villagers did not give in. The stalemate has lasted for five or six days, and no results have yet been obtained. (12th)</p>
<h3>Sixth Route Army Captures Biaohu; Remnants Flee from Yuexi, Retreating to Xingguo</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Sixth Route Army, under Xue Yue, tasked with advancing from Yongfeng towards Xingguo and Ningdu, forming a pincer movement with the Third Route Army advancing from Guangchang. After recovering Longgang, Xue's troops immediately began building a road from Yongfeng through Longgang to Xingguo territory. At that time, the fake 23rd Division of Sun Chaoqun, the fake Western Independent Regiment 123, and various local guerrillas, constructed pillboxes and strong fortifications at Biaohu (south of Longgang) to prevent the National Army from advancing. Commander-in-Chief Xue, in order to complete the road from Longgang to Gulonggang, and to destroy the pillboxes and blockade the bandit areas, ordered Han Hanying's troops to attack south. On the 3rd of this month, at Xiazhang, fifteen miles south of Longgang, they discovered bandit fortresses built by the fake 23rd Division on the high mountains of Biaohu on the west bank of the river. Zhang's regiment of Han's division immediately forced a crossing and launched a frontal attack on the bandits. Tan Desheng, the fake commander of the 67th Regiment, and Yu Chujie, the commander of the 69th Regiment, personally supervised the battle at the front line. The National Army fought bravely, pressing forward step by step. After three hours of fighting, they completely captured Biaohu. The remaining bandits retreated from Yuexi and Liangcun into Xingguo territory. Xingguo is only a few dozen miles from Gulonggang, with mountains upon mountains, and was once the lair of the Red Bandits. Further advance must wait until the roads are repaired, and the rear supply and deployment are complete. However, judging from the current situation, it is expected that by the end of this year, the various route armies will be able to completely recover Xingguo, Yudu, Huichang, Ruijin, Ningdu, and Shicheng.

<h3>Southeast and East Route Armies Encircle Western Fujian Bandit Area; Longyan to Xinquan Highway Completed</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Jiang Bocheng arrived in Guangdong on the 7th and consulted with Commanders-in-Chief Chen and Li regarding bandit suppression plans. The First and Second Columns of Guangdong will attack Huichang and Yudu within a short time. At the same time, the troops of Huang Renhuan and Chen Zhang stationed in Yongding, Shanghang, and Wuping in western Fujian, together with the East Route Army, will encircle Changting. According to military news today, the Red Bandits in northern Fujian are currently gathered in Changting, Ruijin, Shicheng, Gucheng, Ninghua, Qingxi, and Guihua, numbering about 40,000 to 50,000, but their combat power is extremely weak. The highway from Longyan to Xinquan was completed last month through the cooperation of the military and civilians. Last month, the Central Army advanced to Baisha, and from Baisha, Hexi, Chadi, and Taiba, advanced to Jiuxian in Shanghang. Everywhere they went, the Communist bandits scattered at the mere sight of them. Now, they have moved from northern Fujian to western Fujian. The National Army encircling the bandit area has very strong forces. Last month, when the Central Army advanced to attack Guangchang, they fought fiercely with the bandits for four days and nights, and the main force of the Red Bandits was almost completely annihilated. The bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi now are large in number but lack quality, merely having an empty appearance. After the Central Army advanced into Liancheng, Zhong Zhaokui's troops moved from Lanjia Ferry and stationed in Baisha. Another unit patrols back and forth in the area bordering Yongding and Shanghang. A few days ago, more than a thousand Communist bandits raided Dajing but were defeated by Zhong's troops. More than thirty female Communist bandits were captured alive, all of whom were young women. More than two hundred female bandits are also imprisoned in Shanghang Prison, all of whom were captured on the front lines. Luo Pai, near Changting, has the fake army's Independent 8th Regiment, with 500 to 600 rifles, specializing in disturbing Bingguofang on the Fujian-Guangdong border. Lian Rihui has joined forces with the local militia to search and suppress them, and they have retreated to the rear. (8th)</p>
<h3>Former Henan Industry Department Head, Zhu Tingfen, Commits Suicide in Poverty in Jinan; Appointment Arrives Hours After Death; Well-wishers Unaware, Mourners at the Door</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Zhu Tingfen was a native of Gushi County, Henan, over fifty years old. It is said that he graduated from the Army University in Beiping during the late Qing Dynasty and even served as the school's principal. After the Republic, when Wu Ziyu stationed troops in Henan, Zhu served as the head of the Henan Industry Department and concurrently as the Land Reclamation Director. He was upright and honest, leaving office with no savings. His circumstances have worsened in recent years. Because he had a fellow-township relationship with Zhang Honglie, the head of the Shandong Construction Department, he traveled to Jinan this spring, seeking a place to settle. Zhang, noting that there was work here but there were more monks than porridge, said it would be difficult to arrange something immediately, providing some funds and asking him to wait. Zhu stayed at the Tianxiang Inn in Xian Dong Xiang in the city from March 7th, feeling depressed and bored. For months, he had not found a place to eat. Recently, Zhang Honglie recommended Zhu to the Salt Affairs Audit Office. Yesterday, he completed the appointment, appointing Zhu as a counselor and supervisor of the Qingdao Salt Fields, with a monthly salary of over one hundred yuan. That evening, it was sent to Zhang's place. Today (the 13th) at eight o'clock, Zhu Tingfen got up as usual and went to a nearby Douzhi shop for breakfast, then returned to the inn (Room 4 downstairs). Afterwards, he was not seen leaving. Zhang Honglie sent someone to deliver the appointment to Zhu at eight in the morning. The inn's tea servant saw that the room door was unlocked and there was no one inside, and replied that Zhu had gone out and would return shortly. From morning to afternoon, the messenger went several times but did not see him. It was not until four o'clock in the afternoon that the female owner of the inn went upstairs to look for something (there were no other guests upstairs) and discovered that Zhu had hanged himself. He had been dead for some time. The inn reported it to the Construction Department. Zhang Honglie, noting that Zhu had been in Jinan for several months and had only secured work today, yet Zhu died on this very day, a difference of only a few hours, lamented his tragic fate. He notified his family (Zhu has an old wife and five sons) on the one hand, and sent someone to report to the court for an inspection, buying a coffin for the burial. Fellow Henan townsmen in Jinan heard the news and went to offer condolences, all sighing deeply.</p>
<p>It is said that Zhu was most proficient in mathematics. Recently, he had a work sent to the Commercial Press for publication. Although he was depressed in the inn, he showed no other signs before his death. However, a week ago, he said to someone, "My mathematical skills are unmatched. I have gained insights from studying integrals, and I have made a final work. I am afraid I will die soon." At the time, the listener thought it was a joke, but unexpectedly, Zhu hanged himself. How tragic! (13th)</p>
<h3>Qingpu: Fire at Kerosene Depot Injures Person</h3>
<p>Shen Zhongqing, a kerosene merchant in this county, opened a Yuanmao kerosene depot in his own residence on Dongmen Street. Since starting the business, his situation has been good. However, in late April of this year, he suffered a fire, and his son was burned, and has not yet recovered. After this setback, the merchant, in order to maintain his livelihood, tried to raise funds and obtain loans to rebuild a new house on the original site for both residential and business use. At the same time, he opened a branch store in Fangjia Yao in District 12 to start business first. Unexpectedly, less than two months later, the branch store suffered another fire at noon the day before yesterday. In an instant, all the houses and goods were reduced to ashes, and a clerk in the store was burned. It is said that the injury is quite serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: New Police Chief Takes Office</h3>
<p>Shen Wei, the police chief of Wu County, was ordered to be transferred to the police chief of Changshu County. Wang Bolin was appointed to fill the vacancy. Wang was appointed and came to Suzhou, originally scheduled to take office on the 14th. Because the predecessor did not complete the handover procedures, it was changed to yesterday (the 15th) at 9:00 am to take office.</p>
<h3>Chefang Township Robbery Injures Person</h3>
<p>On the night of the 14th, two bandit boats carrying more than ten bandits arrived at Chenjia Ham in Chefang Township. After landing, they first swarmed into the home of villager Wu Yiwu to rob. They beat and injured his nephew Wu Yujiang. They then went to the homes of Chen Junxian and Zhang Linzhao to search and rob, and then fled with their loot. It is estimated that the three families lost about five or six hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Anti-Smoking Conference Resolves Important Cases</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Anti-Smoking Personnel Conference has hired Li Tiping, Qian Sunqing, and Gu Shuzhi as committee members, appointed by Concurrent Chairman Yan and local officials. Later, Gu Shuzhi firmly requested to resign, and Cheng Jingtang was hired as a committee member instead. Yao Fusheng was appointed as secretary, Hua Hongtao as the general affairs section chief, Chen Yuchu concurrently as the investigation section chief, Zhu Yuancheng as the license section chief, and Jiang Zhizhen as the audit section chief, to handle various affairs and report to the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee for approval. Yesterday, the first committee meeting was held, and the following matters were resolved: (1) Designating Puren, Tongren, and the Sanatorium, and the Physicians Association to handle the smoking cessation center and scheduling regular meetings to coordinate methods. (2) Future regular meetings will be held twice a month, and temporary meetings will be held as needed. At this point, the registration and licensing procedures for smokers have been actively prepared. Officially designated native opium dens: two native opium dens are allowed to be set up in the Wuxi urban area, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Those who hold licenses will pay donations according to the grade. Grade A will pay 2,400 yuan per year, Grade B will pay 1,400 yuan, Grade C will pay 800 yuan, and Grade D will pay 400 yuan. Once the number of native opium dens and opium shops is limited by the County Anti-Smoking Committee, no new ones will be allowed to be added, and they will be gradually reduced each year, completely banned within four years. As for opium sales points, they are not currently being established for the sake of caution. The total number of smokers has never been statistically counted. Now, according to the provincial order to urgently investigate and report the exact number of smokers, based on the confirmed number of smokers who obtained licenses during the anti-smoking campaign in 1918, estimated to be more than 15,000 people, it was decided to report first in order to obtain licenses.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Continue to Request Exemption from Improvement Fees</h3>
<p>Xinyi, Xingji, Yuji, and eighteen other silk factories are against the Silkworm Model Area's collection of three yuan per load of dry cocoons for improvement fees. Because the dry cocoons transported by each factory to the city have been detained, the raw material supply has been cut off, and the factories are about to stop production. The livelihoods of most female workers are in danger. Yesterday, they continued to meet and resolved as follows: (1) Continue to submit a petition to the Model Area to fight for exemption and ask the Chamber of Commerce to request the release of the detained cocoon ships first. (2) Telegraph to fellow businesses in various counties in this area to fight for exemption together. (3) Recently, some people claiming to be inspectors freely enter the factories without any courtesy, hindering work, and should be unanimously rejected and not allowed to enter the factory. The county government believes that the improvement fees collected by the Model Area are used for improving the silkworm industry, which is of great interest to the silk merchants themselves. The factories' firm opposition is unreasonable. In addition to issuing an order not to allow it, it also intends to summon representatives of each factory, Chen Geshu and others, to the government to talk and persuade them. The Chamber of Commerce is also deeply concerned about various extreme measures and has invited Qian Fenghao and Hua Shaochun, the chairmen of the silk factory and cocoon industry guilds, to the meeting to coordinate and find a proper solution.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhuomin Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Liu Zhuomin, the former chief of the Second Public Security Branch, was found guilty of obstructing official duties for resisting the handover. His wife, Wen Rongzhen, was found guilty of insulting public officials on the spot. The local branch court interrogated and detained them, which also led to the mutual accusations between Gu Renfa and Li Shuyun. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Liu Zhuomin and his wife, after being prosecuted by the prosecutor, were tried by Judge Liu Bingzhen of the criminal court, and the verdict was announced yesterday (the 15th) at 10:00 am. Liu Zhuomin was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for concealing items under his official control as a public official. Liu Wen was sentenced to forty-five days of detention for insulting public officials on the spot while they were performing their duties according to law. After the verdict, Liu Zhuomin was returned to detention, while Wen Rongzhen was released on bail with a written guarantee of five hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Riot in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhu Yunting, a famous doctor in the northern suburbs of this county, was previously kidnapped twice by bandits and was finally released after paying a ransom of one thousand yuan. Later, Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the county water patrol, arrested Yu Hailin, a key criminal in the case, in Shanghai and brought him back to the county for interrogation and detention. Unexpectedly, Yu, incorrigibly wicked, behaved lawlessly in prison, bullying fellow prisoners. Yesterday, during mealtime, after the prisoners finished their silk reeling work in the workshop, they were about to eat when Yu suddenly had a quarrel with a prisoner over a minor matter and then started fighting. The prisoner was severely beaten with an iron tool, causing injuries all over his body and unable to move. Seeing this, the other prisoners became indignant and questioned Yu. Yu shouted loudly, "I am a kidnapper, a more serious crime. My treatment is different from yours. You must give me some consideration in everything!" His attitude was arrogant and unreasonable. Then, a prison worker reported the situation to Warden Xing Yuantang, who led armed police to suppress the riot, and they dispersed. Afterwards, the prisoners, in the name of the entire group, made two requests to the authorities: (1) Yu Hailin is lawless in prison and should be punished severely, with the death penalty. (2) Or transfer the prisoner to the judiciary for handling.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Ministry of Finance Abolishes Deputy Transport Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>Zhou Zonghua, the manager of the Yangzhou Salt Affairs Audit Branch and concurrently the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai, after being ordered to be transferred to the Zhejiang Hangzhou Audit Branch and concurrently the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai, his vacancy has been filled by Yao Jingyu. Now it is heard that the Salt Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, feeling that the auditing affairs in the southern Huai area are becoming more leisurely and in order to economize public funds, plans to abolish the Gutang Branch and the Yangzhou Deputy Transport Commissioner's Office, and change Yangzhou to an Audit Branch subordinate to northern Huai. It is also heard that Niu Jianxia, who previously served as the assistant of the Gutang Branch, has been confirmed as the assistant of the Yangzhou Branch.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Policeman Attempts Extortion, Frightens Woman to Death</h3>
<p>Shen Zhenxing, who privately set up a smoking den in Machao, Hanbeimen Street, had a mistress, Zhang, who ran the business at home. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 13th, three men dressed in long robes and wearing yellow police trousers, resembling policemen, entered the Shen family's house intending to extort money. The woman, seeing their fierce appearance, ran out wildly and suddenly fell to the ground outside the house, dying. The three men, realizing that they had caused trouble, fled together. Afterwards, the family tried to save her and urgently called a Western doctor to examine her, but it was too late to revive her. Her family felt resentful because the policemen had extorted and threatened her to death, and requested the authorities to investigate and bring the policemen to justice.</p>
<h3>Famous Library Almost Destroyed by Fire</h3>
<p>The Tieqin Tongjianlou Library, a famous Chinese library belonging to the Qu family, was built in Jinlilu Village outside the east gate of this county. However, the valuable books inside have all been moved to Shanghai. Now, the site contains only an ancient building and ordinary books. The day before yesterday afternoon, a fire suddenly broke out at the Qu family's house. Because the countryside lacks firefighting equipment, it soon became a raging fire. Although there were many villagers, they had no way to extinguish it. The Tieqin Tongjianlou Library was nearby, in great danger, and everyone was alarmed. They urgently used the telephone to hire a gasoline boat from the city fire department to rush to the rescue, and fortunately, it was extinguished immediately. The library was unharmed, but many houses belonging to the Qu Wenqing family and the nearby Zhu family's hotel were destroyed, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Hangzhou Republic Daily Reorganized into Southeast Daily</h3>
<p>Since the Hangzhou Republic Daily purchased a web printing press last year, increased its pages, reformed its layout, and enriched its content, its sales volume has increased sharply from 12,000 to over 20,000 copies within nine months. Its distribution area has expanded to various provinces in the southeast. As highways in various provinces are gradually being built, Hangzhou is gradually becoming the transportation center of seven provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei. The Oriental Grand Port is also being actively surveyed. The newspaper's president, Hu Jianzhong, consulted with the editor-in-chief, Liu Xiangnu, and decided to further implement a major reform plan. He requested the Provincial Party Department to allow the newspaper to be jointly run by public and private interests, to solicit new shares and form a board of directors. Zhang Daofan, Chen Bulei, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Guo Renyuan, Zheng Yi, Fang Qingxu, Luo Tian, Xu Shaodi, Zhang Qiang, Ye Suzhong, Hu Jianzhong, and other thirteen people will be directors, with Chen Guofu as chairman. Wang Tingyang, Xiao Zheng, Zheng Wenli, Hong Ludong, and Pan Gongzhan will be supervisors.

<h3>Impressions of Economic Survey of Guangxi Province (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>Binyang is a handicraft area in Guangxi and is also the most famous place for producing porcelain. Because there are more people than land in this place, residents are engaged in a kind of handicraft to maintain their lives, and people are rich in imitation, so it is also known as "Little Japan". They can imitate all kinds of small toys, such as felt hats, copper and iron utensils, curtain hooks, children's toys, and even imitate Mauser pistols. Often there is a village where the residents of the entire village are engaged in a kind of handicraft, and this handicraft has become a special product of this village. For example, people in Fangcun weave wick cords, people in Shikan village make paper fans and paper quilts, people in Cucun make small iron utensils for daily use, Wang Xie village makes mud baskets and lamp ropes, people in Dazhuang village make rain hats, Mengcun make mats, Shicun make pestles, Shangzhai village make combs, Luocun make pens, Donglu Mengcun weave sleeves, Yangcun make hats, Donghai village make toothbrushes... They are engaged in this kind of work all year round. The things they make are carried to the market to sell. Binyang has a Lixu, which is one of the four largest markets in Guangxi, a market every three days. It is not only a distribution center for import and export goods in the county, but also a general meeting place for commodity trade in neighboring counties in Binyang. On the day of the market, these craftsmen, whether making hats, umbrellas, copper and iron utensils... stop work. They get up early and carry their burdens to Lixu. Lixu is a town ten miles away from the city. The excitement and tension of this day are extraordinary. It is really a sea of people, and the voices are boiling, just like the factory temple of the old lunar year in Beiping. It is not until four or five o'clock in the afternoon that people slowly disperse. After this market period, Lixu becomes like a dead city, with the shop doors ajar, business is bleak, like the atmosphere of the New Year when every family closes its doors in our mainland. Here, we can not only see that Guangxi's commerce is still staying in the market system, but also that craftsmen are also part-time traveling merchants. The organization of this kind of feudal economy is unexpected for those of us who are used to living in big cities.</p>
<p>Binyang porcelain is to Guangxi as Jingdezhen porcelain is to Jiangxi, although Jingde porcelain has a domestic market, Binyang porcelain has only a part of the provincial market. The discovery of Binyang porcelain is said to have a history of more than 80 years. It originated in Laoyao Village. At that time, only unglazed pottery was made. Later, people from Jiangxi served in the army in Yunnan and Guizhou. They passed through Binyang and their funds were cut off. They went to Laoyao Village to work. Within two or three years, they discovered white glaze stone and began to study how to apply a rough glaze. Later, Jiang of Lusi (village name) sent people to Jingdezhen, Liling and other places in Jiangxi to investigate the manufacturing method and study pigments. In recent years, with the promotion of the authorities, the manufacturing method has been greatly improved. In July of the year before last, the Construction Department specially hired technicians to investigate and test the porcelain quality in the area. As a result, they found that the clay quality here was inferior to Jiangxi but better than Shanghai. However, because the method used was too crude, 400 yuan was allocated to encourage them. Local kiln owners were also very enthusiastic at this time, raising a total of 2,000 yuan, and then borrowing 4,000 yuan from the Construction Department, and then established a new porcelain factory. Now the factory is managed by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. The porcelain they produce is much better than the native method. This kind of porcelain is completely imitating Jiangxi porcelain and improving it. Although it is not as fine as the products of Jiangxi, it is completely different from the local porcelain. However, their products are not many now, and there are no sellers on the market. According to the Guangxi authorities, their purpose of improving Binyang porcelain is not to compete with Jiangxi porcelain or imported products in the market outside the province. They only hope that Binyang improved porcelain will be able to seize the position of Jiangxi porcelain and Guangdong porcelain in the provincial market in the future, because until now, Binyang native porcelain can only be sold to the remote counties in the upper reaches of the Xijiang River. From Guixian downstream, as well as Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, Yulin... The market is filled with Hunan porcelain and Jiangxi porcelain. Therefore, if Binyang porcelain is promoted, a part of the leak in Guangxi Province can also be resisted.</p>
<p>In addition to the new porcelain factory, Binyang probably has more than 300 kilns and more than 20 kilns. The total value of porcelain produced each year is about 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. They often use one kiln together, each kiln has nine sections, the first and last two sections are empty, and there are seven sections that can be filled with things, so each kiln has as few as seven or eight households and as many as thirteen or fourteen households. This kind of kiln is often the only production tool inherited from their ancestors.</p>

<h3>General Manager of Sichuan Minsheng Company, Lu Zuofu, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Talks Freely About the Recent Situation in Sichuan Province and the Company</h3>
<p>Lu Zuofu, a Sichuan industrialist and general manager of Minsheng Industrial Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM on the Minsheng Company's Yongnian Wheel from Chongqing. A reporter from the Xinsheng Society met with Lu at the Minsheng Shanghai Branch yesterday and heard him express the following:</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Completed</h3>
<p>Since Xu Xiangqian's unit, the fake Fourth Front Army of the Communist bandits in western Hubei, sneaked into Sichuan, Supervisor Liu Xiang has cooperated with various armies and divided into six routes to encircle and suppress them: First Route Deng Xihou, Second Route Tian Songyao, Third Route Li Jiayu, Fourth Route Yang Sen, Fifth Route Tang Shizun, Sixth Route Liu Bangjun. Initially, there were about 150,000 Communist bandits. After phased and painful suppression, they have gradually been eliminated. The Communist bandits are hiding in Tongjiang and Wanyuan counties, with about 40,000 to 50,000 bandits. The general attack order for the fourth phase of encirclement and suppression has been issued, and the number of suppression troops has been increased. It is expected that they can be completely eliminated within sixty days. At the same time, food to the bandit areas has been cut off, so the bandits are feeling a great shortage of food. Unless there are unexpected events, the bandit suppression plan will be completed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Construction Begins</h3>
<p>Supervisor Liu Xiang recently held a production and construction conference in Chengdu. Various administrative officials and local gentry and merchants participated in the conference and decided on many construction methods, which have now begun and are being carried out separately. As for the highways in Sichuan Province, such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Tongchuan, Guang'an, and Shunqing, they have all been connected and long-distance buses are running, making transportation very convenient. After the bandit suppression is completed, they will engage in post-war reconstruction and reorganize the army to carry out construction work with full force.</p>
<h3>Consolidation of Taxes and Currency</h3>
<p>Various tax rules in Sichuan Province have now begun to be consolidated, based on the principle of a single tax system. The detailed methods are still under discussion, but the kerosene and cigarette tax rules have already implemented a single tax system. In short, everything will only be successful after the bandit suppression is completed. The lack of uniformity of currency is also being consolidated. The Sichuan Mint has stopped minting currency.</p>
<p>The Sichuan armies in Chengdu and Chongqing both commonly use Sun Premier's currency. However, it is not commonly used outside of Sichuan province because the silver content is slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Company Business</h3>
<p>Minsheng Industrial Company has (A) operating businesses, now divided into three categories: (1) Shipping, operating on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with a total of twenty-eight ships, totaling approximately seven thousand tons. (2) Machine factory, located in Chongqing. (3) Power plant, located in Hechuan, which has been in operation for eight years. The initial capital was eight thousand yuan, with more than six hundred shareholders. The capital has been increased year by year, and now it has reached 1,169,500 yuan. Accumulated public reserve funds and insurance are about 1 million yuan, totaling approximately 2 million yuan. (B) Investment businesses: (1) Beichuan Railway, totaling 100,000 yuan, from Datiankan to Baimiaozi, 16 kilometers long, on the banks of the Jialing River. It is now planned to extend the railway to the Qu River, approximately 60 kilometers. This railway is a light-rail type, specializing in coal transportation. (3) Coal mines, totaling three locations, on the banks of the Jialing River and in Yunyang, totaling 50,000 yuan. The above two items are Minsheng Company's investments in local construction.</p>
<h3>Social Enterprises</h3>
<p>(1) The China Western Scientific Research Institute, located on the banks of the Jialing River, is divided into four departments: Biology, Agriculture and Forestry, Geology, and Physical Chemistry. Its annual funding is 50,000 yuan, all subsidized by various parties, such as the Sichuan Provincial Bank, Minsheng Company, China Cultural Foundation, Beiping Geological Survey Institute, Academia Sinica, and Chief Supervisor Liu, etc.; (2) The Gorges Defense Regiment Affairs Bureau trains 500 members of the local militia for the purpose of preventing threats to mines and rural areas. The bureau also established a local hospital and a public education center, including a public night school, a boatmen's school, and a career placement center, etc.; (3) Within the public sports field, there are parks, libraries, zoos, museums, etc.</p>
<h3>This Mission Here</h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Lu added that his most important mission in coming to Shanghai from Chongqing this time is to inspect the Shanghai branch of Minsheng Industrial Company. He will stay in Shanghai for about a month before returning to Sichuan. It is said that in addition to inspecting the Shanghai branch, Mr. Lu will also take the opportunity to investigate Shanghai's industries. General Manager Gongquan of the Bank of China, etc., will schedule a meeting.</p>
<h3>Important Figures Travelled to the Capital Last Night to Meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Who Will Come to Shanghai for a Short Rest</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission returned to the capital yesterday morning to participate in the 10th-anniversary celebration of the military academy. Various important figures also went to the capital to gather. Elders Li Shih-tseng and Zhang Jingjiang, former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Song Zi-liang, etc., took the 11 o'clock night train to Nanjing last night to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is reported that Mr. Chiang plans to stay in the capital for a few days and then come to Shanghai before returning to his ancestral home in Fenghua or going to Hangzhou for a short rest. Huang Fu, chairman of the North China Reorganization Committee, has no plans to leave Shanghai recently and may wait until he has met with Mr. Chiang in Shanghai before returning north.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Saying the Kagemoto Incident is a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>The China Eastern News Agency reports that Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren returned to Nanjing in a hurry from Jiangxi on the 13th. When Vice Consul Kagemoto was found, and after Consul General Suma paid his respects and apologies to Wang [Jingwei], the matter was superficially concluded on the 14th. Mr. Tang came to Shanghai by night train the day before yesterday to change his medicine. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Tang at his residence yesterday, inquiring about the ins and outs of the Kagemoto incident. According to Mr. Tang, the matter is a thing of the past and he hopes that the people of the country will regard it as a fleeting cloud and not be concerned about it, forgetting it completely. Therefore, he does not want to comment on the matter any further. He also said that he deeply admired the calm and composed attitude of the Chinese press towards the matter, and hoped that it would maintain this attitude consistently. Mr. Tang returned to Nanjing by night train on the same day due to being busy.</p>
<h3>Kagemoto Incident, Huang Fu Expresses His Thoughts: Sharp Nerves Often Lead to Mistakes; Remaining Calm Often Leads to More Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that after Kagemoto was found, a reporter from the New News Agency wanted to know the details of the incident and drove to visit Huang Fu, chairman of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, who was staying in Shanghai, to ask for his thoughts. He stated his thoughts as follows: After Vice Consul Kagemoto disappeared, both the Chinese and Japanese governments attached great importance to it. Fortunately, he was found by the military police in the capital, and Mr. Kagemoto is safe and sound. This is indeed a cause for celebration for both China and Japan. Before he was found, both Chinese and Japanese people inevitably made alarming speculations. Now that the doubts have been dispelled, we know that the previous speculations were excessive. Things in the world are often misled by sharp nerves. Who knows, under calm and composed circumstances, the result may be more satisfactory. What is particularly interesting to me is that Mr. Kagemoto, unable to endure hunger, went down the mountain to seek food. In his extreme distress, he sought comfort in resigning himself to his fate, yet he still adhered to his moral principles and was not opportunistic. He paid for his meal with a gold button. The owner of the small restaurant, who runs a small business, surprisingly did not accept the gold from the strange foreign guest whose language and appearance he did not recognize. The giving and receiving were conducted with courtesy and respect, which shows the nobility of Eastern morality and the depth of cultivation. If this kind of method and this kind of spirit are promoted in general international relations, and if both sides hold the highest standards of humanity, examine themselves, and adhere to rational principles, there will be no problems that cannot be resolved peacefully.</p>
<h3>Kagemoto Left Beijing Yesterday Afternoon, Arriving in Shanghai This Afternoon to Enter Hospital for Treatment; Whether to Return to His Country Will Be Determined Based on His Condition</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that, according to sources at the Japanese Embassy, Japanese Vice Consul Kagemoto Hideaki, who was stationed in Beijing, rested briefly in Beijing after being found after his disappearance, and then, following the instructions of Dr. Matsui, took the Japanese ship Nanyo Maru from Beijing to Shanghai at noon yesterday. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon and will first enter the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road to treat his neurasthenia. Whether he will return to his country will be determined after examining his condition. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet changed his position as vice consul, nor has it sent any telegrams to Beijing or Shanghai recalling him to his country. It is still unknown what will happen after Kagemoto recovers. Mr. Asahina, the embassy secretary who went to Beijing from Shanghai the night before last, and Dr. Matsui of Fumin Hospital, stayed in Beijing for one day and arrived in Shanghai by night express train at about 7:30 yesterday morning. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Asahina immediately visited Minister Yoshizawa to report on the situation. Mr. Arino, the embassy counselor, and Mr. Kawai, the head of the information department, are still staying in Beijing on official business and have not yet returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company Opens New Lanzhou-Ningxia Route, Scheduled to Officially Open on the 19th; Li Jingzong Returned to Shanghai from Jiangxi Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Mr. Li Jingzong, the general manager of the Eurasia Aviation Company, was summoned to Jiangxi by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the beginning of this month to inquire about aviation matters. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Li at the company yesterday and inquired about his visit to Chiang in Jiangxi and the company's plan to open a new Lanzhou-Ningxia route. He spoke as follows:</p>
<h3>Visit to Chiang in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Li, reports stating that his visit to Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi this time was to ask for instructions on the opening of the Eurasia route are not factual. His trip was purely at the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek. After arriving in Jiangxi and meeting with Chiang, he was asked in great detail about aviation matters. These aviation matters do not refer specifically to the Eurasia route, but the details are not yet ready to be announced.</p>
<h3>Opening of the New Lanzhou-Ningxia Route</h3>
<p>In order to develop transportation in the northwest, the company decided to open a new Lanzhou-Ningxia route. The route is 400 kilometers long, from Lanzhou to Ningxia, and can be reached in two hours. It is scheduled to officially open on the 19th of this month. The opening of this route was not planned in advance. During his last inspection of the Northwest, Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Commission, flew over the route on a Eurasia plane and believed that the route was very short, had a large population, and definitely needed to be added. Therefore, there will be no more test flights before the official opening. As for the schedule, flights will depart from Shanghai to Lanzhou every Tuesday, and then from Lanzhou to Ningxia. Every Friday, flights will depart from Ningxia to Lanzhou and then to Shanghai. The fare is set at over 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Trip to Xinjiang to Meet Sheng is Undecided</h3>
<p>As for the completion of the Eurasia route, the situation in Xinjiang is not yet very clear. To this day, planes can only reach Lanzhou. Although the company has repeatedly sent telegrams to negotiate, it has not been effective. Recent news has it that Sheng Shicai, the governor of the province, is now running his own private airline within the province. According to a telegram from Sheng, the airline has been established and flies to the Hami-Tacheng route, and he has requested that Eurasia planes fly to Hami to facilitate connections. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Li believed that Sheng's move was related to the contract signed by the Ministry of Transportation and the German company for the Eurasia route. Therefore, he immediately sent a telegram stating his views and requesting to go to Dihua to meet with Sheng to discuss the matter in person. A month has passed since the telegram was sent, and no reply has been received. Therefore, he will send another telegram to request it so that the Eurasia route can be completed as soon as possible. As for the date of going to Xinjiang to meet with Sheng, it will be determined after the reply telegram arrives.</p>
<h3>Commentary by the Central Bank Corporation on the Current State of China's Railways: Progress is Being Made and the Future is Optimistic</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the Sino-British Bank Corporation, a financial institution that invests in China's railways, is very familiar with the situation of China's railway administration. The company recently held its annual meeting, and Chairman Bernard reported that: (1) The Beining Railway was affected by the situation last year, and the Tianjin-Yushu section was not opened to traffic until August last year. The Shenyang-Yushu section of the railway was also occupied by the Japanese. However, the monthly income of the section within the customs area is still 800,000 yuan; (2) The income of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway last year was about 13.5 million yuan, an increase of more than 4 million yuan compared with the previous year. The total surplus for the year was about 6 million yuan. The construction of the Shanghai Railway Station and the Nanjing Ferry cost a lot. The compensation and interest are paid monthly as scheduled; (3) The income of the Jinpu Railway last year was about 21 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan compared with the previous year. The total net surplus was 6 million yuan. The chairman concluded that although China's railway administration is in a very difficult environment, there are signs of progress and the future is optimistic.</p>
<h3>Government Consults with China Travel Service to Undertake Through Train Service; The Company is Still Considering Carefully</h3>
<p>The China Eastern News Agency reports that, according to reliable sources, there is no problem in principle with the through train service, but in terms of technical aspects, the organization of the commercial agency undertaking this matter has a major relationship with the principles. If this kind of agency is well organized, it can completely avoid the suspicion of contacting pseudo-agencies and can safeguard national sovereignty. It is said that although the agency is jointly organized by China and Japan, it must be in accordance with Chinese law. In the government's opinion, China favors China Travel Service. China Travel Service has a long history in society and is trusted by both China and foreign countries. If it is appointed to this matter, it will greatly benefit national sovereignty and status. The authorities have repeatedly consulted with the travel agency, hoping that the travel agency will prioritize the country and resolutely undertake the task. However, the company is still considering it carefully. Once it is resolved, it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>The General Situation of China's Trade with Southeast Asia in the First Four Months of This Year: Trade Surplus with Singapore and the Philippines, But the Total Still Shows a Deficit of Over 50 Million</h3>

<h3>All North China Merchant Ships Will Implement Alliance Cooperation Tomorrow; Freight Rates and Commissions Are Still Being Negotiated; Implementation Methods Have Already Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Sixteen Chinese shipping companies, in order to save North China's shipping industry, have formed a cooperative alliance to increase freight rates and unify shipping fees. This matter was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the joint unity of the companies and the request for foreign shipping companies to join have been actively carried out. The news that this newspaper reporter continued to obtain is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Methods</h3>
<p>The cooperation methods of the 18 Chinese and foreign shipping companies have been agreed upon by the representatives of the various shipping companies. After being unanimously approved, each shipping company will send one responsible representative to form a joint office. Five representatives will be selected from the representatives to serve as executive members of the joint office, and the remaining representatives will serve as supervisory members. It is stipulated that each company must first pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan to the office, which will be deposited in the bank in the name of the executive members. If it is to be withdrawn, it must be signed by all the executive members before it can be withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Increase Freight Rates</h3>
<p>The allied companies decided to increase shipping fees, starting with rice and flour, appropriately increasing freight rates, and then continuing to discuss the increase in freight rates for groceries. The allied companies will set uniform commissions and must abide by the shipping rates set by the joint office. After that, there must be no more temporary declines in prices in secret. The joint office may send supervisory members to the various shipping companies to inspect books and accounts. If they object to the inspection or violate the agreed-upon shipping rates, the office may confiscate their 2,000 yuan deposit.</p>
<h3>Exchange Bills of Lading</h3>
<p>If the allied shipping companies load rice, grain, and wheat flour, they must send a report to the association and notify the various companies after three days to facilitate exchange.

<h3>Delineation of Boundaries Between Shanghai, Songjiang, and Nanhui Counties is Underway; Shanghai County Mainly Delineates the Songjiang-Nanhui Border Area</h3>
<p>Miao Qiping, commissioned by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has come to investigate the issue of the boundary delineation between Shanghai, Songjiang, and Nanhui counties. It is learned that this case originated from the third administrative meeting held by Shanghai County last month. Members Huang Yunshun and Jiang Shijie proposed that the current area of the county is less than 500 square li and the population is less than 110,000. It is found that Zhuanqiao, Fengzhen, Zhujiaxiang, Changqiao, and other places belonging to Songjiang County are far away from Songjiang City. In order to facilitate administration, they should be劃歸 under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County. In addition, the nine townships, including Zhongxinhe, belonging to Nanhui County should also be劃歸 under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County. It was resolved to present the reasons in detail by the county and request the provincial government to re-劃歸. Now, Provincial Commissioner Miao has been accompanied by Pan Zhongjia, the county magistrate of Shanghai County, Jin Tigan, the county magistrate of Songjiang County, and Yuan Xiluo, the county magistrate of Nanhui County, as well as the district chiefs of the disputed areas, to conduct investigations separately. However, the people of Songjiang and Nanhui counties oppose the re-劃歸 and demand that the original state be maintained, and each submitted a petition. The people of Nanhui County, on the other hand, demanded that Sanlin, Chenhang, and other places belonging to Shanghai County be劃歸 under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County, on the grounds that although these two places are under the jurisdiction of Shanghai, they are separated by the Huangpu River and should be劃歸 under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County according to their natural form. Commissioner Miao recorded the investigation separately and drew a map of the terrain, which will be returned to the province for review. It is unknown how it will be resolved in the future.</p>

The two public association members</p>
<p>The five public associations, including the Industry, Transportation, and Trucking Industry, have reported, but because they have defaulted on membership fees for more than two years, the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees decided to suspend their attendance. In addition, the nine public associations, including the Fur Industry, Hat Shop, Silk Thread, Restaurant, Textile Machinery Materials, Cyan Cloth Dyeing Workshop, Thermos Bottle, Seafood Shop, and Straw Hat, have not reported in accordance with the regulations.

<h3>Dunbenli Property Owners Voluntarily Reduce Rent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dunbenli properties on Zhoujiazui Road and Yuanfang Road, which are handled by the Dunxu Bank, were newly built last year. As soon as the rent reduction movement began, the price of the properties in the area was reduced. However, after the tenants in the area formed a branch, they requested a further reduction. After a negotiation between the two parties, it was decided to reduce the rent by another 5%. From yesterday, the rental staff of the bank have been collecting rent from the tenants in the Citizens' Joint Association of the First Special District.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Letter to Concession Authorities: Request to Postpone Pressing for Renovation of Street-Facing Buildings</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the British Concession's Public Works Department, and the French Concession's Municipal Council, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: On the 14th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Pawnshop Association stating that rents in Shanghai are already high, and miscellaneous expenses are also substantial. Since the January 28th Incident, the market has declined daily, and prices have plummeted. In addition, the dumping of foreign goods has led to the near bankruptcy of most industrial and commercial businesses, with many already feeling unable to maintain operations. They are doing their best to weather the storm by economizing, but housing costs are a major expenditure. Many businesses cannot afford rent, and their rent arrears are growing. Landlords are renovating city properties hoping to revive the market, but this only leads to higher rents, making it even harder for businesses to lease. City properties are closing, affecting the city's appearance. We only wish that when raising rents, they would consider the difficulties businesses face in operating. We would like to request that you forward this letter to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the British Public Works Department, and the French Municipal Council, requesting that they temporarily postpone pressing for the renovation of street-facing buildings, so as to temporarily maintain the market and protect industrial and commercial businesses. We have observed that landlords, in order to increase rental income, are renovating buildings that are not yet particularly old and renting them out to new tenants. This self-serving behavior has become almost a common practice. While this may be related to revitalizing the market, in reality, rents are only getting higher, further exacerbating business difficulties. Based on the aforementioned circumstances, we respectfully request that your bureaus consider the current economic hardship and, in the future, when landlords apply for renovation permits, if their buildings have not reached the point where renovation is absolutely necessary, handle the matter strictly. Regarding the renovation of street-facing buildings, unless the construction poses a genuine safety hazard, we also request that you temporarily postpone urging landlords to renovate in order to alleviate business difficulties. We would be most grateful."</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Charity Play a Great Success: President Kong Attends and Gives a Speech; All Programs are Brilliant</h3>
<p>The Charity Play, sponsored by the Charity Association, lasted for three days. The day before yesterday, the 14th, was the second day. The president of the association, Kong Xiangxi, came to Shanghai from Beijing to personally participate and give a speech to the audience on the importance of the charity work. A record of the speech is as follows:</p>
<h3>Kong's Speech</h3>
<p>I am very grateful to the Yong'an Music Society, Mrs. Du, Mrs. Zhang, Mrs. Lu, Miss Hua, and others for performing and raising funds for our association. As the president of the Charity Association for six years, I have always felt that carrying out charity work stems from our inherent love and our bounden duty. People's circumstances in life are different. If those who are well-off can help those who are less fortunate, we can all live in happiness and peace. Children are the weakest members of humanity, especially those who are uneducated, uncared for, harmed, or abused. Adults with the ability to protect themselves should love and care for these children with the love of a mother, educate them, and cultivate them into complete individuals. National wealth and strength will then be achieved without even trying. Today, the performers on stage are giving their best, and the guests in attendance are enthusiastically participating, which shows that everyone has a broad love for children and recognizes the responsibility for charity. I feel very honored for the China Charity Association and very optimistic about the future of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Crowded with Guests</h3>
<p>Because the play on the first day was so well received by the audience, the ticket sales today were even more enthusiastic. Celebrities and beauties gathered in one place, and the streets were packed. In addition to the president of the association, Kong Xiangxi, and the general secretary, Xu Jianping, famous people such as Wang Xiaolai, Guo Shun, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin attended together.</p>
<h3>Brilliant Programs</h3>
<p>Today, the Yong'an Music Society performed "Love in Troubled Times," with excellent singing and acting, and outstanding artistry. Mrs. Zhang and Xiao Dazi's performance of "Sangyuan Hui" (The Mulberry Garden Meeting) was lively and interesting, with superb skills. The whole audience was captivated. Mrs. Du, Mrs. Lu, and Miss Hua's joint performance of "Huilong Ge" (The Returning Dragon Pavilion) was elegant and harmonious, filling the entire hall. Their male attire was heroic and impressive. When the gongs and drums stopped, the audience was still reluctant to leave, truly making it the best of the play.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Hosts Guests from All Walks of Life to Visit Public Bus Management</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau has been operating public buses on the Shanghai-South, Longhua, and Three-Route Circular City lines for over a month. Due to proper management methods, the results have been excellent. Bureau Director Xu Peihuang, in order to gather more ideas, has specifically scheduled a visit on the 19th of this month (i.e., Tuesday) from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM at 252 Xie Xu Road in the South City to host representatives from all municipal agencies, various sectors, and newspaper reporters to visit the bureau's public bus management.

<h3>Women's National Products Year: Joint Meeting of Design and Economic Committees; Holding a National Products Exhibition at Various Girls' Schools; Requesting National Products Stores to Indicate Manufacturer's Trademark</h3>
<p>The Women's National Products Year Movement Committee held a joint meeting of the Work, Economic, and Design Committees at its clubhouse on Longhua Road last night. Key issues were discussed, such as marking national products for easy identification. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The seventh joint meeting of the Work, Design, and Economic Committees was attended by committees include Tang Guanyu, Lin Kecong, Zhu Wang Wanqing, Li Manyun, Huang Bingpei, Wei Zengpei, Cai Zhoujun, Yang Weiyu, Huang Renzhi, Wang Hanqiang, Pan Yangyao, Wu Zhihao, Sun Daosheng, Shen Jinghui (represented by Wei Taishun), Cheng Shouzhong (represented by Ni Baiyan), Ni Baiyan, and observers Wei Taishun, Zhou Xixin, Fei Xia, Cao Fengxiang, and others, totaling over thirty people. Chairman Lin Kecong reported that since the establishment of the committee, the promotion of national products has gained considerable recognition from all sectors of society. However, the results are still limited, failing to achieve widespread understanding and significant impact, which is regrettable. Half a year has passed in a flash, and the colleagues should redouble their efforts in future steps and work to avoid being laughed at by outsiders. Subsequently, Ni Baiyan reported on the work progress in the West Shanghai market, and Huang Bingpei reported on the economic situation.</p>
<p>Resolutions: (1) Proposal to amend the committee's work outline for the second half of the year: (Resolved) To be submitted to the Design Committee for design and voted on at the next meeting.

(5) How to hold a national products exhibition at various girls' schools? (Resolved) The committee will prepare to contact factories and schools, with Zhu Wang Wanqing, Huang Bingpei, Pan Tang Guanyu, Lin Kecong, Li Manyun, Fei Xia, Zhou Xixin and others representing the promotion efforts.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Puan" Vessel: Dispute over Tips Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>A dispute over tips between the workers in the third and fourth-class cabins of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Puan" vessel and the steward, Situ Langchuan, was formally resolved yesterday through mediation by the Seamen's Union with the signing of an agreement. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Dispute over Distribution of Tips</h3>
<p>The "Puan" vessel was leased by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the Navy Department last year and began operating on the Shanghai-Qingdao and Shanghai-Putuo lines. The steward, Situ Langchuan, hired workers to serve passengers in the first, second, third, and fourth-class cabins. When the workers first started working on the vessel, the steward determined whether to allow workers to pay a deposit or not based on whether they had credit. Those who paid a deposit paid different amounts, such as thirty, fifty, or one hundred yuan. The workers also had to pay 80% of the tips they received from serving passengers to the steward. Later, the workers felt that they only received 20% of the tips each time, which was not enough to live on, so they had a dispute with the steward. The workers in the first and second-class cabins resolved the dispute themselves after both parties agreed a month ago. However, due to the steward dismissing Liu Awei and two others on trumped-up charges, the opinions of both sides became increasingly polarized. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the General Seamen's Union mediated several times, but without results.</p>
<h3>Signing of Resolution Method</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially dispatched Section Chief Yao, together with Seamen's Union members Jiao Bolin, Shanghai Branch members Lu　Zhi, Lü Shuangxi, Secretary Si Shijian, and staff member Song Xiaoyun, to convene a mediation session and sign the following agreement: (1) The distribution of tips will temporarily follow the "five-five" and "four-five" distribution, i.e., 55% for the workers and 45% for the steward, Situ Yuchuan, and all miscellaneous expenses will not be borne by the workers (This section only applies to third and fourth-class cabins; the first and second-class cabins will continue to follow the "five-five" custom). (2) The deposits paid by the workers must be deposited with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, or the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be responsible for returning them. (3) Whether Liu Awei and the other two have committed any errors will be investigated and handled by the union within one voyage. During the investigation period, the three will leave the ship for one voyage. If it is found that they have not committed any errors that warrant dismissal, they will return to work on the ship after one voyage. (4) The steward, Situ Langchuan, shall not hire new workers, thereby reducing the livelihood of the original members. The current quota is twelve, and it shall not be changed easily. However, if it is necessary to hire new workers due to business reasons, the approval of the bureau must be obtained, and the union may introduce members to be selected by the steward.</p>
<p>[P&gt;Manufacturers in Penglai Market Oppose Landlord Increasing Rent; Organize a Petition Delegation; Submit to the Municipal Government Requesting Prohibition</p>
<p>The Penglai Market in the South City was built with the sole investment of Kuang Zhongmou, who promoted it as a way to promote national products and prosper the market. He invited domestic manufacturers to rent shops and set up stores. Over the years, it has become the only national products market in the South District. The rent was initially ten yuan per room, then increased to fifteen yuan. After the January 28th Incident, it increased to twenty yuan. Recently, Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the market, plans to continue to increase the rent. The manufacturers and stores believe that at a time when the market is sluggish, business is declining, and the entire city is carrying out rent reduction movements, the market is actually proposing a rent increase, which is an intentional attempt to destroy the national products business. They have expressed their opposition and organized a petition delegation, which yesterday jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters, and sent letters to the municipal chamber of commerce and other groups, requesting them to find ways to stop the rent increase and provide righteous assistance.</p>

<h3>Dragon Boat Races at Bansong Garden</h3>
<p>The Bansong Garden in the South City has always been renowned. The pavilions, ponds, mountains, and water scenery in the garden have always been a famous scenic spot in Shanghai. Therefore, dragon boat races are held every Dragon Boat Festival to embellish the scenery. The dragon boats this year are not only beautifully decorated and novel, but also dazzling and moving, making the event even more lively. It is estimated that the ticket sales this year will be over 20,000. In order to guarantee income, the garden has negotiated with Wang Xianglin and Lian Yaobang, the managers of the Sihai Insurance Company, to underwrite the ticket sales income. If there are any remaining tickets due to rain, the company will compensate the amount accordingly.</p>

<h3>Lantern and Garden Party Held at Xu Garden for the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>The Lantern and Garden Party held by the Xiehe Company at the Xu Garden on Kang Nao Tuo Road for the Dragon Boat Festival ended yesterday. It is reported that the ticket price was only thirty cents in order to be accessible to the public. Therefore, gentlemen and ladies from near and far flocked to visit. Yesterday was the first day of the opening. From morning to night, tourists flocked to the garden, with shoulders rubbing against each other and heels bumping into each other, creating a crowded scene. The deserted and desolate Kang Nao Tuo Road was transformed into a bustling and noisy city with heavy traffic. The garden was full of lanterns and streamers. At night, the lights were dazzling and eye-catching. The most eye-catching things in the garden were the two green and white divine snakes, which were said to have been produced in the Five Sparrow Mountain in Quzhou, Zhejiang. They were purchased at a high price and transported to Shanghai for display. The white snake was pure white, like bright jade, while the green snake was emerald green, like green jade. They were truly rare objects in the world. According to legend, the ancient books said that the White Lady and Xiaoqing came down to earth. Although this is close to superstition, it is also a coincidence. In order to avoid congestion, the association has specially issued snake viewing tickets attached to the entrance tickets, allowing visitors to visit in order. However, people were still scrambling to get in, causing congestion. The dragon boat on land, which was said to have been made by Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty, was exquisitely constructed, with interlocking corners and meticulous craftsmanship. It was truly a spectacle. There was also a rolling dragon boat, which was even more brilliant and superb, with lively eyebrows and dancing eyes, making people exclaim in admiration. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival according to the lunar calendar. It is expected that there will be even more tourists today than yesterday. However, the event will only last for two days, so the opportunity will not come again.</p>
<h3>Pan Xulun Talks About Xinhua Village</h3>
<p>Since the news of the construction of Xinhua Village was released, all sectors of society have paid close attention. According to accountant Pan Xulun, the village is located on the West Sports Association Road, which can be said to be the Yuyuan Road of Shanghai's eastern district. The air is clean, the scenery is beautiful, the transportation is convenient, and the equipment is complete. It has the convenience of a city and the pleasure of a countryside. The new village has a small vegetable market and a small school, which can save residents the trouble of traveling and provide children with a good education. I (Pan Xiansheng calls himself) have always paid close attention to living conditions. Because our mental fullness, mental flexibility, and work efficiency are all closely related to where we live. The British and American people regard housing as one of the most important things in life. Therefore, when building houses, they must choose excellent environments, which is why they are physically strong and mentally energetic. We Chinese are the sick men of East Asia. Now, Xinhua Village is truly an ideal place to live. Living there will definitely benefit the body and mind. Another thing is that the purchase of land and houses in Xinhua Village is done through installment payments, which are paid back monthly, making it easy to pay off the house money. After a few years, the houses and land will all be self-produced, and the housing problem will be solved forever, which is very good. Therefore, I have already ordered two lots of land in the village and decided to build a house to solve my own housing problem.</p>

<h3>Japanese Restaurant Incident: Love Triangle Erupts; Owner and Waitress Compete for Affection; Chinese Man Violates Morality, Takes Another Man’s Wife</h3>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily reported on the 15th that a Japanese woman, Terazaki Fukuko, aged 47, came to Shanghai after the incident and opened a restaurant in Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road. Later, due to poor business, she incited her waitress to engage in prostitution. In March of this year, a druggist named Nakanishi Ichiro from Wakayama Prefecture frequented the restaurant and became involved with the waitress, Midoriko. Before long, Nakanishi Ichiro also became inseparable from the owner, Fukuko. At the end of last month, the waitress, Midoriko, discovered that Nakanishi was also having sexual relations with Fukuko, and jealousy consumed her, brewing into a physical altercation. It was resolved with the mediation of a third party, and Midoriko was eventually fired. As a result, Fukuko gained exclusive possession, and Nakanishi moved into the restaurant in March, living with Fukuko as if they were husband and wife. However, their finances were very poor. Nakanishi owed 15 yuan to the Hiroshima Inn for lodging, and Fukuko could not afford to pay the rent and trade association fees. However, to revitalize the business, in addition to Fukuko's younger sister serving as a waitress, they recently went to Nagasaki to find three or four beauties. Currently, the Japanese puppet town council has learned that Fukuko is already married and that her behavior is disrupting public order. They have resolved to expel her.</p>
<h3>After Divorcing His Wife, Ye Xunruo Sues to Affirm Invalidity; Loses First Trial and Now Appeals; Opposing Party Unwilling to Reconcile</h3>
<p>Ye Xunruo from Ningbo is a member of the same clan as the late Ye Chengzhong, who donated his wealth to promote education, and is from a wealthy family. However, he is inherently addicted to gambling and prostitution. After marrying Zhu Wenjuan, he continued his ways, indulging in drinking and gambling, and seeking pleasure with prostitutes, and the family's fortunes gradually declined. Although his wife repeatedly advised him, he rarely repented. Therefore, Zhu felt unwilling to live with him until old age, as he was immersed in pleasure. She hired a lawyer years ago to negotiate a divorce. After discussion, a divorce agreement was signed, and their relationship was terminated. The children born were to be raised by Ye, and Zhu would not interfere. Ye promised to repay 10,000 yuan of Zhu's private savings that he had used. Later, because Ye failed to repay the debt as scheduled, Zhu filed a lawsuit against Ye, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the 10,000 yuan debt. Initially, it did not involve the marriage issue. Unexpectedly, Ye, when sued, suddenly filed a lawsuit against Zhu Wenjuan, demanding confirmation that the previously signed divorce agreement was invalid. From then on, the debt dispute turned into a divorce case. After the first instance trial by the First Special District Court concluded, it was ruled that the divorce agreement had the signatures of both parties and was certified by the lawyers hired by both parties, and the procedures were not inconsistent. How could it be overturned afterward? The plaintiff was ruled to have lost. However, Ye was very dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon, three judges, Han, Jiang, and Cai, specially convened a collegiate panel to hear the case. The appellee, Zhu Wenjuan, was absent. The lawyer representing the appellant, Ye Xunruo, stated the grounds for the appeal, saying that Ye really did not want to divorce his wife and requested that Zhu be summoned to court so that Ye could meet with her and attempt a reconciliation. The lawyer representing Zhu Wenjuan replied that Zhu was absolutely unwilling to meet with Ye again. The divorce agreement was signed with the full consent of both parties at the time, and the procedures were handled very carefully. If Ye hoped to reunite, he would have to hire a matchmaker again and remarry. However, this was not something that the law could remedy, nor could the lawyer or the presiding judge advise. He requested that the appeal be rejected. The court then questioned Ye about the circumstances of signing the agreement. According to Ye, he signed it at Cai's law firm. He had no lawyer at first, and although he was not forced to sign, Cai's words were very serious at the time, and he had to sign. After the contract was handed over to his three lawyers for review, they said that he had been fooled, but there was no way to remedy it. After the court finished questioning, it ordered that the date of the judgment be announced later.</p>
<h3>Jointly Established Textile Dyeing Experiment Hall; Director Candidate Determined; Director-General Ding Wenjiang Comes to Shanghai to Visit Cai; Language Group of Research Institute to Move to Beijing Next Month</h3>
<p>After Yang Xingfo, Director of the Academia Sinica, was assassinated by thugs last year, Cai Yuanpei, the director, hired Professor Ding Wenjiang of Peking University as the director-general of the institute, and reorganized the internal structure, reduced the scope of the general office, and changed the Natural History Museum into the Institute of Zoology and Botany. The institute's operations have taken on a new look. It is learned that Ding has come to Shanghai from Beijing to handle various construction matters. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Ding Goes South to Visit Director</h3>
<p>The new Director-General Ding Wenjiang, after taking office in Beijing last month, convened a meeting of the staff of each group to announce the reorganization plan and notified them separately of the reorganization situation. Later, because the teaching affairs at Peking University were not yet finished, he hurriedly returned to Beijing. Now that the school affairs have been concluded, he specially went south from Beijing to Shanghai a few days ago to pay his respects to Director Cai and ask for instructions on everything. Then he will go to Beijing to take up his duties.</p>
<h3>Planning for Textile Dyeing Hall Completed</h3>
<p>The joint establishment of a cotton textile dyeing experiment hall by the Academia Sinica, the National Economic Commission, and the Cotton Control Commission is entirely for the purpose of improving the national cotton production and developing the textile industry. The funding is 400,000 yuan, with the Academia Sinica contributing 150,000 yuan and the remaining amount borne by the Cotton Control Commission. The hall will be located in Shanghai, and the candidate for director has been appointed by the institute as Xu Kuangfu, the former director of general affairs and director of the International Publications Exchange Office.</p>
<h3>Language Group to Move to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has three groups remaining in Shanghai, except for the Archaeology Group, which has moved to Beiping for office work. It is learned that the Language Group will move to Beijing next month for the convenience of work and reference. It will temporarily use the old Geological Institute as its office location. After the new building of the institute in Beijige is completed, all other groups will move to the new building for office work.</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Investigate Maoshan Geology</h3>
<p>According to news from the former office staff of the institute, experts from the Capital Geological Institute have gone to Maoshan several times to investigate the geology. Because the mountain area is vast, it cannot be surveyed completely in a short time, so there are no results yet. Now, geologists Meng Xianmin and Li Yuyao have been sent to survey. After the Maoshan survey is completed, personnel will be sent to Anhui to survey Huangshan.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Assassinated in Inn on Balijiao Street; Man Seizes Opportunity to Flee; Young Woman Already Stabbed to Death</h3>
<p>Last night, a young woman was murdered in an inn on Balijiao Street (i.e., West Xinjiao Street) in the French Concession. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Place of Secret Rendezvous</h3>
<p>The Rongxing Inn at 335 Balijiao Street, outside Xiaobeimen in the French Concession, is owned by Yang Xie, a woman from Ningbo (41 years old). It has been open for many years. Although small in scale, the business is doing quite well. In reality, it is a place for temporary secret rendezvous for lower-class men and women.</p>
<h3>Man and Woman Arrive Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 4 p.m., two young customers, a man and a woman, suddenly arrived at the inn. The man looked like a worker, and the woman looked like a maid. The man signed his name as Zhu Axing, 26 years old, and the woman's name was Zhu Lu, 24 years old. Both were from Anhui and made a living by rowing boats. After entering the inn, the waiter Wang Afu led them to room number 4 upstairs. They paid a room fee of 40 cents.</p>
<h3>Man Leaves First</h3>
<p>After the room fee was paid, the waiter Wang Afu, as usual, brewed tea and brought it along with the washing water, and then left. There was nothing unusual at the time. After a while, the sound of laughter was heard from the two. Two hours later, at about 6:15 p.m., the man called the waiter Afu to buy two bowls of salty rice porridge. About ten minutes after the waiter left, one of the men and women suddenly stepped out of the room, talking to himself, and left.</p>
<h3>Tragic Scene on the Bed</h3>
<p>Before long, the waiter Wang Afu had bought the salty rice porridge. When he entered the room and looked around, the man was gone. At first, he suspected that he had gone out for something and would return soon. After waiting for about ten minutes and still not seeing him return, Afu entered the room to wake up the woman. Unexpectedly, she did not respond no matter how often he called. Knowing that something was wrong, he quickly opened the curtains. He saw that the woman was naked, with only one sock on her foot, and blood was flowing from her neck.</p>
<h3>Stabbed Ten Times in Total</h3>
<p>Seeing this, Afu was extremely frightened and shouted loudly. The innkeeper and other staff members entered the room together to check. She was already dead. They quickly reported to the constable, who immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. It was estimated that there were ten stab wounds on the head and neck, and two stab wounds on the wrist. He immediately notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Examination Office and ordered the mortician to carry the body to the examination office to await a report to the Second Special Court for examination.</p>
<h3>Huo Brothers Axe Dong Couple; Reason is Huo Ruiting's Lost Wife; Result is Dong Daofang Couple Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 15th) at 5:10 a.m., near Jisifeier Road and Kaina Road in western Shanghai, inside Rongqing Lane 56, next to the Chinese Bank dormitory, a case of brothers wielding axes to kill a couple occurred. The two victims suffered a total of 23 stab wounds. The man was already dead, and the woman was also in critical condition. Blood was flowing everywhere, and the scene was too horrible to look at. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Thugs Arrive Suddenly in Sweet Dreams</h3>
<p>Dong Daofang from Xuzhou, 40 years old, worked in a yarn factory. His wife, Wang, 34 years old, also worked in the yarn factory's weaving room. The couple lived together in the front building of Rongqing Lane 56. Yesterday at 5:10 a.m., as the couple was sleeping soundly in bed, the landlord downstairs happened to open the door to empty the chamber pot. Two thugs suddenly rushed in and went straight upstairs, breaking down the door. The couple was awakened from their dreams.</p>
<h3>Strength No Match for Double Axes</h3>
<p>When the Dong couple saw two people each holding a sharp axe, they knew they had come to cause trouble. They jumped up and were about to question them, but the axes were already coming down, hacking fiercely. Although Dong tried his best to resist, because he was one against two, Wang was injured and fell to the ground first. Seeing that Wang had fallen, Dong, still injured, grappled with the two thugs to the hall downstairs. Due to exhaustion, his neck was cut off and he fainted. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two murderers fled quickly. The neighbors immediately telephoned the Haige Road Red Cross Hospital to send an ambulance to take Dong and Wang back to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Blood Stains Everywhere Upstairs and Downstairs</h3>
<p>Tan, the district chief of the sixth district, received the report and immediately dispatched Inspector Cheng and the detective team leader Wu Kezhong, deputy team leader Dong Wenrui, and detectives Yang Qing and Wu Yihe to rush to the scene. They found bloodstains everywhere upstairs and downstairs in the front building, and questioned the landlord. They also went to the hospital and saw that Dong had five or six stab wounds on his face and head, his neck bone had been cut off, and his arms, shoulders, and back were also injured in five or six places. He had already died. Wang's cheek was cut off, and there were about seven or eight wounds on her head, neck, hands, and chest. She was unconscious and on the verge of death. The two victims suffered a total of twenty-three wounds.</p>
<h3>Murderers are Two Brothers</h3>
<p>After detectives Wu and Dong conducted an investigation, they learned that the murderers were Huo Ruiting and Huo Ruilan, two brothers from Shandong who lived in the pavilion room at 131 in the same lane. The reason was that Huo Ruiting's wife, Chen, worked in the same factory as Dong's wife, Wang, and they knew each other. On the 5th of this month, they went to see the temple fair in Caojiadu together. After that, Chen suddenly disappeared. Huo searched everywhere, but there was no trace of her. He repeatedly negotiated with Dong and Wang, accusing Dong of plotting against her. Therefore, he resorted to this cruel act to seek revenge. District Chief Tan ordered all detectives and police officers to tighten their grip on the two murderers and arrest them for punishment.</p>

<h3>Jin Menggen Assassination Case: Murderer Found from Letters; Accountant Recognizes Huang Amei as One of Four People</h3>
<p>Jin Menggen, chief inspector of the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, western Shanghai, was suddenly shot and killed on the morning of the 11th of this month. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is learned that after the case occurred, Tan, the district chief of the sixth district, ordered detective team leaders Wu Kezhong and Dong Wenrui to arrest the murderer. Team leader Wu found out that Jin had met with four people before his death when Jin held a shareholders' meeting at the Tiansheng Inn in Baxianqiao, French Concession. One of the four people was named Huang Amei. The day after Jin was killed, his family received a letter saying that the murderer was Huang Amei and others. After obtaining this clue, team leaders Wu and Dong took Cao Chuqiao, Huang Peilin, Wang Yixin, and Hu Zongxi to 19 Huangjia Lane and arrested Huang Amei, seizing a single-edged sword. They were taken to the district. Then, Xue Qingrong, the accountant of Tiansheng Inn, was summoned to the district and identified Huang Amei as one of the four people who came to the inn. When questioned, Huang's confession was evasive and cunning. It was decided to write a report and send him to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yihua Foreign Firm Expands Business</h3>

At the beginning of the change of ownership of the Guangyao ship, business operations will be improved and perfection will be pursued.

According to the manager, the Guangyao ship will resume sailing in a few days after the rectification is completed. It is also learned that the new company's office is located in the Dachuantong Building on Jiujiang Road.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>The Interest in Reading Literary Books 丨丨Answer to Gu Nianchun and Li Xingyu丨丨</h3>
<p>Before talking about the main text, I would like to talk to readers about something else. A year ago, I went to a middle school in a certain inland area to teach Chinese. When I first arrived, the friend who introduced me (also a Chinese teacher) specifically said to me, "The students here have very old-fashioned minds. Most of them still want to read classical Chinese, so the textbooks used are also classical Chinese selections published by a certain bookstore." I asked him what was the reason, and he replied, "They can understand vernacular Chinese at a glance and don't feel any interest, but classical Chinese is not..." I didn't express my opinion at the time, but I always felt that his words were not entirely true. The so-called interest is definitely not something that is born and cannot be transferred, and the teacher should not cater to the students' interest and lead them into the quagmire. So, on the one hand, I negotiated with the school authorities that the Chinese classes I taught would not use textbooks, and I would compile lecture notes; on the other hand, I devised a plan myself, first selecting some articles from the May Fourth era "and classical Chinese, and then selecting a few literary essays, with a few pure literary works attached. The intention was to first break their prejudice against classical Chinese, and then make them understand the true meaning of literature. Sure enough, my plan worked. In the first few weeks, some people did object and asked to read classical Chinese, but later this situation gradually decreased; in less than half a year, even the old teacher who taught classical Chinese was driven away by the students, creating a new literary atmosphere in the school.</p>
<p>It is very easy to get the answer by using this fact to explain the question of Gu and Li's interest in reading.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu said that 丨丨After reading a few literary books, I found them boring and tasteless, and interrupted my interest in reading.</p>
<p>Mr. Li said that 丨丨I love to read Gong Yuzhi's novels, but I don't love to read Lu Xun and Mao Dun's novels.</p>
<p>Obviously, the crux of the two gentlemen lies in the fact that they do not know how to receive interest from literary books, or because of the weakness of their perception. The deciding point lies in their lives and their literacy in literature.</p>
<p>Villagers think that it is the most boring thing to see students in the city playing football. Even if they occasionally kick one or two feet out of curiosity, they may even end up with leg pain and back pain. However, in the eyes of general sports-loving students, playing ball is more interesting than anything else. What is the reason for this? This is not about the characteristics of a certain person, it is because of their different daily lives that they have developed different interests. Of course, there are also people who are interested in events that are contrary to their special lives. For example, the children of scholarly families often do not want to study but like to fool around, and people who live in tall buildings prefer to swim in the water. This is a common phenomenon. However, it can still only be explained by their lives. The occurrence of these interests is a reflection of their lives. They are dissatisfied or tired of their own lives, and they are interested in the "Lord" interest.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the situation of "life", the interest of each person is still different in doing something, which is entirely because of the difference in the degree of understanding of something. A child who is just starting school often wants to rely on learning, but there are many scholars who can't even eat and can't stop him from reading. Regarding this, some people may wonder, "Why do people 'like the new and dislike the old'?" I can answer that this is human curiosity. Curiosity can lead to interest, but curiosity has nothing to do with interest. An old gentleman goes to a dance floor to watch dancing entirely out of curiosity. If he says that he is interested in dancing because of this, then it is a wrong. Talking about the true meaning of his article to a person who has just recognized "zhiwu" will naturally give rise to the feeling of playing the piano to a cow; if he only has the strength to bear a weight of fifty catties, and he wants to make him carry a burden of one hundred catties, then he can only force people to walk on the road to death.</p>
<p>Based on the above explanation, it can be seen that it is not worth being surprised that Gu and Li cannot arouse interest in reading literary books, but there are actually their own reasons; due to the author's experience (such as the facts mentioned above), to solve this problem 丨Improve your interest in reading literary books, on the one hand, you need to make your life closer to literature, on the other hand, you must not think of "reaching the sky in one step" but learn that "step by step" step by step, of course, this is not an easy thing.

They asked for the arrears to be paid so that they could resign and seek another life. There was no solution so far, and they should resign unanimously. (2) Please ask the bureau to send someone to take over within three days, and will not be responsible if the deadline is exceeded (3) The arrears of salary before June 15 will be required to be paid in full by June 15, and if they are not paid by the deadline, they will sit and demand payment together with the teachers (4) All teachers and teachers will organize a salary-demanding group, and the principals will petition the county government, and the secretary will meet with them. The result was satisfactory, and the final decision will be made after County Mayor Li returns to Jinhua.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Naval Academy to Begin in the Second Half of the Year</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Chen Shaokuan stated on the 14th that the plan to establish a Naval Academy had been drafted by the Ministry of the Navy two years ago, but it was not implemented due to lack of funding. The case is currently still under review and discussion by the Central Political Council. It is hoped that preparations can begin in the second half of the year, but rumors that the academy will open on July 1st are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>The China Child Education Society's Record of Observation in Japan (9) Zhou Shang</h3>
<p>1. National schools cultivate the foundation for the nation's ideals.</p>
<p>2. Social schools temper the practicalities according to the demands of society.</p>
<p>3. Children's schools guide children's lives and assist them in their upward progress.</p>
<p>Also observed were the school's three major characteristics: 1. strengthening physical fitness and emphasizing vocational guidance; 2. engaging in extracurricular guidance to enrich leisure life; 3. connecting with post-employment support organizations in vocational guidance.</p>
<p>The school views vocational guidance as the convergence point of the nation, society, and children, and as a necessary requirement of education, not merely a superficial and fashionable accessory. All aspects of play life and leisure life must have vocational guidance as their core. Vocational guidance is the result of holistic education. Therefore, true education awaits the reasonable combination and expression of both general cultivation and vocational guidance. Thus, vocational guidance is often linked to the entire education system. The following are some of the more obvious comparisons:</p>
<p>(1) Vocational Cultivation: To enable children to gain an understanding of occupations and practical skills, the children's mental attitude toward occupations must first be established. 1. Special instruction in learning guidance, training facilities, physical education, and health care. 2. Localization, pragmatism, and operationalization of various subjects. 3. Fellow student lectures, career talks, specimen collection. 4. Receiving guests and answering the phone in the school, practicing bicycle sales, connecting and unifying the guidance of various departments. 5. Diligent service, simulated employment, occupational participation, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Job Selection Guidance: With the goal of making the best use of talent, on the one hand, supervise children to work hard and make progress, so that they can adapt to the occupation, adapt to their personality, and adapt to the environment. 1. Various performance checks and overall observation. 2. Children's own reflection and occupational aspirations. 3. Reflection on circumstances and the hopes of parents. 4. Individual guidance on job selection and communication with the parents' association. 5. Job referrals and investigations. 6. Job placement and simulated employment.</p>
<p>(3) Post-Employment Counseling: Maintaining contact and counseling among the school, the individual, and society after employment. 1. Correspondence, visits, convening guidance. 2. Special establishment of a post-employment counseling department. 3. Alumni association, job love, alumni association magazines.</p>
<p>The above are all the school's claims. Some parts are worth adopting. After the visit, we were invited into the auditorium and served tea and snacks, and a movie about school life was shown. First, daily life was shown, such as school buildings, morning meetings, breaks, bugle calls, morning exercises, salutes, and various sports. Next, scientific life training was shown, such as research under a microscope, laboratory work, factory work, animal husbandry, and horticulture. Then, commercial practice was shown, such as remittance, counting tickets, typing, sales techniques, and exhibition products. Then, leisure life was shown, such as travel, cooking, etc. National spirit was shown, such as worshiping the hero Nan Gong, and social life was shown, such as boarding a boat for a visit. The lives of graduates were shown, such as chicks leaving the nest and serving in various places.</p>
<p>Looking at the spirit of the entire school, it is all focused on vocational education. According to the principal, 90% of the graduates over the years have jobs. At the end of March this year, more than a thousand people graduated, and most of them have already been employed. Among them, 305 are shop assistants, 340 are interns, 31 are going on to higher education, and 64 are others. Among the employed students, 373 were introduced by the school, 133 were introduced by their families, and 210 were introduced by others. "It is difficult to find a job in Japan now." According to a recent survey report, there are more than 29 million employed people and more than 34 million unemployed people in the country. Employed people only account for 45.6%, with men accounting for 59.1% and women accounting for 31.9%. Graduates of this school can easily find positions. If it were not for the proper training on weekdays, how could this achievement be possible?</p>
<p>The foundation of education in Japan today is labor training and military national education, which is its old foundation. Vocational education has reached an advanced goal. It is expected that factory-like schools and multi-faceted vocational education will be implemented. Japan, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, may be on par with the United States in less than twenty years. Their handicraft courses have remained handicraft courses for decades, unlike our country's handicraft courses, which have changed to crafts, then to labor, and other new terms. Observing the results, others are still far behind. Today, Japan can be said to have everyone educated (according to recent statistics, only two out of a thousand people have not received education). Therefore, even vendors and waiters are literate, and even maids have at least six years of primary school graduation qualifications.</p>

The reporter visited Tan Jingjun, the host of the association, yesterday for details, which are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Plans to Invite Cochet to Perform in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Tan Jingjun, it is a pity that the American professional player Tilden Vines stopped performing in China. The association is now planning to invite the former world amateur tennis champion, now a professional player, the French Cochet, to perform in Shanghai, with a reward of 5,000 yuan. Upon hearing the news, the reporter deeply admired Tan Jingjun's enthusiasm for tennis and his spirit of invigorating Chinese tennis skills. I hope this matter can be realized and create a new era for the Chinese tennis community.</p>
<h3>Participants in the Open Doubles</h3>
<p>The open doubles tennis tournament is scheduled to begin next Monday. There will be a total of sixteen participating pairs. The strongest pairs are Pan Lifei and Carlson, and Defu and Xu Chengqi.

In addition, there are also pairs of Hennisbao and Mada, Hade and Chen Yixu, and Hede Min and Mr. Li. Lin Binhua did not join due to an arm injury, and Qiu Feihai was unable to participate due to the Shanghai Tennis Association.</p>
<h3>Xu Chengji's Position Has Been Settled</h3>
<p>The young tennis player Xu Chengji has intended to stay in Shanghai since returning from the Far Eastern Games, because there are more tennis talents in Shanghai and he can have more opportunities to hone his skills. Tan Jingjun helped him to introduce a position. According to Tan, Xu has been employed by Puyi Real Estate Company. From then on, Xu's life will be stable, and his tennis skills will be improved. He will practice at the Chinese Tennis Association every afternoon at 4 pm.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tennis Association to Open Soon</h3>
<p>According to Tan, the Shanghai Tennis Association (formerly the Chinese Tennis Association) operated by Qiu Feihai, the land lease is completely free, and 10,000 yuan is used as the association's expenses. It is now scheduled to officially open on the 24th of this month. It is planned to invite Xu Chengji Fukaelson and others to perform the opening competition. Xu Chengji, a member of the Chinese Tennis Association, has agreed to participate in the performance. After Qiu took over the Shanghai Tennis Association, there has been no formal notice.</p>
<h3>Construction of the Chinese Tennis Association</h3>
<p>The clubhouse of the Chinese Tennis Association will be completed soon. According to Tan, during the summer competition, it is planned to put white canvas awnings on the stands so that visitors do not feel the pain of sunlight. It is also planned to build a three-story clubhouse on the back end of the red sand court when tennis sports are stopped in winter. The internal equipment strives to be perfect, and badminton can also be played, so that members can have sports and entertainment opportunities throughout the year.</p>

<h3>World Heavyweight Boxing Championship, Baer Wins Over Canella, Wins Championship and is Loved, Canella Loses Due to Lack of Strength</h3>
<p>(Havas Agency, New York, 14th) The Italian giant boxer Canella held the world heavyweight boxing championship with the American California boxer Marks (surname) Baer (name) here today. The game was scheduled for fifteen rounds, and in the eleventh round, Canella was unable to support it. The notary ordered a stop to the game and ruled that Baer won. Some spectators said that Canella himself asked the notary to stop the game. After the game, Baer went out and was warmly welcomed by the crowd outside the venue. Canella was stuck in the room, tears filled his eyes, and gave a speech to the press, saying that he was dizzy because his ankle was dislocated in the first round. He fell from time to time, that is, his foot was painful and he could not maintain his physical balance, not that he was knocked down by Baer. "After the first round, Yu reluctantly continued the game, and it was very inconvenient for the foot to be dislocated. It is not true that some viewers said that he asked the notary to stop the game," he said. A doctor wrapped Canella's ankle. Apart from this, the visible scars on the body were only a high swelling on the brow and some abrasions.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Instructions</h3>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan's remarks were that the results of this elementary school games were very good, and more new records were created than in the past. There were also more participants in the public games than in previous years. This shows that not only schools pay attention to sports, but also the general public pays great attention to physical fitness. We all hope that the number of participants in the games will increase year by year, and the sports results will also improve year by year. Giving awards is just to encourage participants to have a stronger interest in sports. Everyone should always remember that the games are for physical fitness, not for private fights, but to serve the country and the nation. Recently, I have seen many places, even schools, losing their original purpose and treating athletes as protectors of personal interests and bodyguards.

<h3>Shanghai Racing Club's Ball Shooting Accuracy Competition Successfully Concluded. Ding Mingyi Champion of Group A, Xu Shizhang Runner-Up. Xu Baomin Champion of Group B, Yu Junfa Runner-Up</h3>
<p>The second members' ball shooting accuracy competition initiated by the Shanghai Racing Club was held sequentially from the 1st of this month with great enthusiasm. The finals for Group A were held the night before last (the 14th). The competitors were Xu Shizhang, who is well-known in Shanghai, and Ding Mingyi, a rising star. Judging from their combat experience and skills, Xu was indeed formidable. Therefore, Zhuang Fengming and Fang Bofen, the impartial judges of the club in charge of this event, announced that Xu would have 800 points as the finish line, while Ding would have his points reduced to 620 as the finish line, so as to balance the strength of both sides. As a result, the audience was packed. Initially, Xu took the lead all the way. In the first 20 shots, he scored 276 points, far surpassing Ding's 93 points. The 180 points Xu gave Ding was a head start. Later, when Xu reached 400 points, Ding was still defeated, so everyone expected Xu to win easily. Unexpectedly, Ding suddenly had a smooth run, scoring many points in a row, step by step catching up, directly chasing little Xu, from close to even, and finally surpassing little Xu, winning with 620 points compared to Xu's 60 points, taking two and a half hours. The referee was Zhuang Fengming, and the recorder was Hu Yongan.</p>
<p>The Group B finals were also very interesting. Xu was a fledgling tiger, full of courage and vigor. Yu Junfa was a master, with excellent ball skills. Both were famous players. The difference in their balanced strength points was large. Xu had 215 points, and Yu had 420 points. Despite the difference, many still expected Yu to win steadily. During the competition, Yu once led by 200 points, but unexpectedly suddenly slumped, just like little Xu in Group A. The two were very similar, and Xu and Yu can be said to be in the same boat. In the end, when Xu reached the finish line in 25 minutes, Yu scored 391 points, taking two hours and five minutes. The referee was Jia Changhui, and the recorder was Qiu Yuanming.</p>
<p>The champions and runners-up of both Group A and Group B were each awarded a silver cup. After the Group A competition ended the night before last, Ms. Chen Zhaolu was respectfully invited by Lu Xiwu, the executive member of the club, to present the awards. The closing ceremony was then held amidst cheers and excitement.</p>
<p>The highest score in a single series of shots in each group in this competition was: Group A: Xu Shizhang with 61 points; Group B: Yu Junfa with 31 points.</p>
<h3>Chinese Athletic Association's Sports Meet Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese Athletic Association has scheduled its third sports meet for 1:30 PM today. Originally, it was planned to be held at the National Sports Advancement Track and Field Ground on Labor Father Road, but because the bamboo fences around the area have been removed, spectators would inevitably flood the field, making it impossible to maintain order and hindering the games. Therefore, it was decided to change the venue to the Municipal No. 1 Sports Ground on Daji Road. The track and field team members who were selected on the 9th will all compete in the finals today. At the same time, the association's national martial arts group will perform boxing techniques, and spectators are welcome to attend without needing an admission ticket.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of Fragrant Incense Drifting</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Once it comes to summer, we must wear gauze clothing as usual; So are we really wearing gauze clothes? Yes, we are really wearing gauze clothing! It's just that under the gauze, we specially make a layer of silk lining, and some cotton is stuffed in the middle. In this way, we can avoid violating the law on the one hand, and avoid being frozen on the other. However, this method is not a new invention, nor is it a secret, but an open compromise; Perhaps shortly after the formulation of these different clothes for the four seasons, someone came up with this method. Even the Empress Dowager herself often does the same. But because her position is so noble, the clothes she wears must always be more distinctive than others, so we use cotton, but she must use silk floss. Silk floss is a kind of messy silk that silkworms spit out. It has a higher temperature and lighter weight than cotton. It is also prepared by the silkworm-raising women in the palace specially for her, so of course it should be enjoyed by her.</p>
<p>Once April arrives, it is the beginning of spring, and all the female officials in the palace must wear jewelry ornaments together. All hairpins, earrings, rings, etc., are either strung with pearls or inlaid with jade, either jadeite or agate. Everyone is dressed in jewels and treasures, which is dazzling to the eye.</p>
<p>Readers can easily imagine how neat and uniform the clothing of officials and civilians in China under the rule of the Manchurian Qing Emperor was, after reading the above simple description; Although their politics were so corrupt, they did pay great attention to the appearance of clothing. Now let me talk more about women's clothing styles. Of course, women are more particular, simply because women love to dress up and love to follow the trend; Even if there are no legal regulations, they will definitely automatically create new styles. Therefore, when winter comes, all their clothing will be decorated with wintersweet flowers. (59)</p>
<h3>The Study of Flying Men</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>In the history of Western mythology, the flying little fairies are stout, like five- or six-month-old babies, holding bows and arrows, with the image of wanting to shoot. There is also the flight of Apuchen Luo, without shadow or form. Holding a long spear in his hand, he pierced any part of the beauty's body. When her eyes first opened, all the first people she saw followed her to the death, unwilling to leave a step.</p>
<p>In Chinese novels, Wang Mang hired a giant on the sacred mountain, ten feet tall, with wings on his back, who could fly hundreds of miles and take the heads of generals as easily as taking things out of a bag. In the Battle of Kunyang, Ju Wuba flew up several times, but was struck down to the ground by thunderstorms. The last time, he desperately took off. Just when he reached Liu Xiu's head, there was a thunderbolt. Liu Xiu was unscathed, and Ju Wuba died in battle, so later history called it "Fengyu Zhan Kunyang" (Battle of Kunyang in Wind and Rain) because of this thunder.</p>
<p>When Hui Qin was besieged by the Jin soldiers, there was a team of six armored soldiers who could fly three feet high. Although it was not a rumor to confuse the public, it was of no help to saving the country. Hui Qin was captured, and the divine soldiers were disbanded. In "The Story of Yue Fei," it is also recorded that Niu Gao smashed the imperial wine to reward the army. The coachman died after drinking a cup, bleeding from all seven orifices. Niu Gao smashed it in anger, and not a drop remained. Although there was merit, it was really too reckless. He was expelled from the camp and had nowhere to go. He met a fairy who taught him piercing-cloud arrows, wave-walking shoes, and life-seizing pills. When attacking Chang Gong, the piercing-cloud arrows shot down a piece of Xi Yun and captured a flying demon. The wave-walking shoes captured Yang Gong. The life-seizing pill saved Yue Fei's life.</p>
<p>Is it true that someone can fly? A newspaper once drew a beautiful woman in its commemorative publication, driving a foot-powered flying machine and distributing newspapers in mid-air.</p>
<p>The "Art Life" magazine had six photos of flying men, blowing the carbon dioxide in their lungs into a rotary flying machine, which could then take off. The moment before taking off, flying as high as twelve meters above the ground, the upward view of thousands of revolutions, the situation of descending, and after safely landing, he told a reporter about his flying experiment: "This forty-second flight was like a dream."</p>
<h3>Finger Painting</h3>
<p>— Qia Qing</p>
<p>When finger painting originated is difficult to determine. In the past, Zeng Banshi and the servants of the First Emperor once painted water gods with their toes; Based on this inference, there should also be people who used their fingers to paint in the Zhou and Qin dynasties. Xiaoshan commented on painting: "Zhang Zao of the Tang Dynasty painted with his hands, and Bi Hong saw it and was surprised! When asked who taught him, he said: 'Externally, I take nature as my teacher, and internally, I obtain the source from my heart.'" Knowing that finger painting in the Tang Dynasty certainly existed, Qing Gao Qieyuan was also skilled in finger painting, calling it "finger life"; Figures, landscapes, birds, and fish were all vivid! Gao Bing of Liaodong once wrote a theory on finger painting: "Lord Keqin learned painting at the age of eight. Whenever he encountered a draft, he would stroke it. After more than ten years, he filled two baskets; When he reached adulthood, he regretted that he could not form his own style! Tired and drowsy, he dreamed that an old man led him to an earthen room. The four walls were covered with paintings, and all the theories were complete, but the room was empty, and he could not imitate them; Only a bowl of water, so he dipped his fingers and practiced with it; When he woke up, he was overjoyed! However, he could not apply what he had learned to the brush, so he was often depressed; He suddenly remembered the method of using water in the earthen room, so he dipped his fingers in ink and imitated the general outline, and obtained all its spirit; He could do whatever he wanted, and everything he did was perfect; Therefore, he abandoned the brush..." How could this truly be taught by the gods! It was because he had been painting for more than ten years, and his skills were already deep, and he suddenly realized something, so he could paint at will, which was the same mentality as the so-called "obtaining the source from the heart." As a result, finger painting stood out as a unique style in the Chinese painting world, and many virtuous scholars and officials playfully engaged in it.</p>
<p>Master Yan Ganyuan of the Late Evening Building, a senior in Guanzhong, is an expert in appraisal, rich in collections, good at calligraphy and painting; His calligraphy is exquisite in all styles, vigorous and ancient, and his reputation is well-known in the world; He mainly paints with his fingers, landscapes, figures, ladies, flowers, trees, fish, dragons, birds, and beasts. Once touched by his fingers, they are all vivid in spirit; And a kind of thick, majestic, and profound charm is especially beyond what the brush can achieve! Probably because Mr. grew up between the rivers and mountains, it is easy to obtain the help of the landscape from nature; Or because he is devoted to antiquities, and his cultivation is deep, he can handle things with ease, like this. I have never seen Zhang Zao's handwriting, so I dare not make any comparisons! If compared with what Ganyuan has done, then modern people are far better than the ancients. Mr. is seventy years old this year, and his spirit is hale and hearty, like a forty- or fifty-year-old man; He has recently created hundreds of finger paintings and calligraphy works, which will be displayed to the public at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth of this month. Those who read Mr.'s paintings in the world, wouldn't they be like Bi Hong seeing Zhang Zao?</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty: Watching Sorrowful Geese Bury Their Heads to Defend the Country; Bullets Pierce Strong Arms and Sprinkle Blood to Stain the Lone City</p>
<p>Our heroes of the Republic of China have all conquered the east and the west in the past. Today, we are very polite to foreigners, but they treat us like this, can we endure this? At this time, there is nothing else to say, it is that they can take our lives, but not an inch of land can be taken away by others. It's like, you live at home, and you haven't offended anyone, but people can break into your house, can you say you won't fight back at all, and just sit here and let people beat you? All good kinds come. Let's close this door together, we can't let the enemy rush in. Do it, brothers. After Zi Qiang finished speaking, he raised the hoe with both hands and dug in the trench again. It was this exciting action of his that revived the lazy trend of the brothers. Zi Qiang thought to himself, no wonder our Battalion Commander Bao is so loyal and brave, it turns out there is a reason. A person who leads others, every move is related to all colleagues, and must be careful everywhere. A soldier must learn from our battalion commander. As soon as Zi Qiang turned his mind like this, he was originally supervising the work on the trenches, but now he did not supervise the work, but personally followed his brothers and dug in one place. But this kind of work is not an ordinary trench digging work. In the outer part of the pass, the weather is colder two months earlier than in the pass, and it is several times colder. At this time, it had already snowed several times. When the snow fell, it would never melt, and the mountains and valleys were all made of silver. Although the snow on the ground did not seep down, the cold air on the ground kept dropping several feet deep into the soil. As a result, some moisture in the soil was frozen into iron plates by the cold air. If you dig the hoe down, the soil can splash the hoe back. Fortunately, Bao Fang had already understood this difficulty in advance, and had already dug two trenches, and now it was just adding another one. (410)</p>
<p>Local Customs and Traditions</p>
<h3>The Art of the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>— Tiansheweng (Old Farmer)</p>
<p>A good festival of the year is a day of entertainment for the people. In times of peace and prosperity, when goods are abundant, good festivals and auspicious days are of course decorated with a lot of public entertainment, which cannot be said to be something that wastes people and money. Moreover, all the entertainment during the festival is not without consciousness, but it has been followed for a long time, and it has slowly lost its original meaning. Taking only the Dragon Boat Festival as an example, in terms of eating; Zongzi, loquats, green plums, shad, seasonal fresh fruits and delicacies are countless. Main entertainment: dragon boat races, hanging Zhong Kui, embroidered sachets, calamus swords and mugwort tigers, all kinds of things are very artistic, not only have a long history of value. The festival is in the middle of the sky, the wind is warm and the sun is warm, the flowers are blooming and the grass is growing, taking advantage of the time when the heat of summer has not yet arrived, talking about the story of the Dragon Boat Festival, isn't it a refreshing and happy thing?</p>
<p>(1) Zhong Kui It is said that Emperor Ming of Tang Dynasty suffered from malaria and dreamed of a big ghost, wearing a torn hat, a blue robe, a horn belt, and court boots, catching small ghosts and eating them. He claimed to be Zhong Kui, a scholar from Zhongnan, who had once taken the exam but failed, and died after touching the steps. Emperor Ming woke up from his dream and his illness was cured, so he ordered Wu Daozi to paint Zhong Kui's portrait. Later, the common people thought that the weather would gradually get hotter after the Dragon Boat Festival, and epidemics would come, thinking that ghosts and monsters were causing trouble. So on this day of the Dragon Boat Festival, they painted a portrait of Zhong Kui and hung it in the hall, thinking that it could scare away demons. In fact, Zhong Kui is the Zhong Kui in the "Records of Examination of Artisans", which is another name for a hammer. The ancients used hammers to drive away ghosts. Ma Rong's "Guangcheng Song" of waving Zhong Kui and raising jade axes is clear evidence. I don't know how, Emperor Ming came up with a Zhong scholar wearing a torn hat, blue robe, horn belt, and court boots, and asked Wu Daozi to paint it. Wu Daozi was a famous painter, and he was especially good at painting these ghosts and monsters, so of course he wrote very well. Zhong Kui is ugly, and his sister is beautiful. When ugliness and beauty are painted together, ugliness also becomes beauty. Therefore, the world has painted a picture of Zhong Kui marrying his sister, but it is very beautiful. Isn't the Dragon Boat Festival painting Zhong Kui an art?</p>
<p>(2) Dragon Boat Racing Liang Zonglin's "Chronicle of Jingchu" said: "Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of May, so Wuling used this day to race dragon boats to summon him." On this Dragon Boat Festival, there is a custom of dragon boat racing, which is more about advocating water sports than commemorating Qu Yuan. Because in the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Wu, and Hubei, rivers intersect, and the people are accustomed to playing in the water. The Dragon Boat Festival is also a season when the weather is warm, and it is most suitable for promoting water sports and encouraging martial spirit. Probably, the dragon boat racing was already promoted by King Fucha of Wu and King Goujian of Yue. Later generations followed suit and embellished, making the dragon boats gorgeous and exquisite, with drums and music, and the prows of the boats all dispatched. The ancient people's legacy of practicing naval warfare has also become artistic.</p>
<p>(3) Calamus Sword It is said that on the fifth day of May, there is a saying that the Tartars should be killed, because the Tartars regarded us Han people as slaves, raped women, and did everything. Our Han people hated it so much that they agreed to hang calamus and mugwort on the doors of every house on the fifth day of May as a sign, and everyone would rise up to kill all the Tartars. Although this legend is not very reliable, the matter of hanging calamus swords is still prevalent today, and there must be a reason for it. Probably, when the Jin and Yuan dynasties ravaged China, they were scattered everywhere. Relying on their own strength, they must have occupied people's fields, raped and looted, and they must retaliate for every grievance. Killing them was the only way to be happy. Hanging calamus swords and killing the Tartars, there may have been such a thing. The hearts of the people are not dead, and hegemony is difficult to last. Have we Chinese people forgotten the meaning of the ancients?</p>
<h3>Mr. Yan Ganyuan's Finger Painting of Snow Scenes</h3>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>New Musical Instrument</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>There are many kinds of musical instruments made using vacuum tube low-frequency oscillators. One of the instruments introduced in this article, originally named Trautonium, was designed by Dr. Trautwein of Germany.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<p>Figure 1 is a commonly used vacuum tube low-frequency oscillator. During oscillation, the frequency varies with the resistance and capacitance within the grid circuit. Because it is necessary to expand the range of frequency variation, both the capacitor and the resistor use relatively large values. When using, first turn the switch SW to set the volume, or to resonate with other instruments. Then, press the copper wire with your fingers to obtain different scales of pitch. (The exact position of each scale must be determined after experimentation.)</p>
<p>The structure of this device is very simple, and even people with no knowledge of radio can easily experiment according to the diagram. After completion, if no oscillation occurs, you can switch the two wire ends of the low-frequency transformer's primary coil (the secondary coil can also be switched). If this still doesn't work, then the inside of the vacuum tube is damaged and needs to be revived or replaced with a new tube.</p>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to actual experimentation, the use of a triode vacuum tube is most effective. As for the type, both AC and DC vacuum tubes are acceptable.</p>
<p>The materials required for this device and their values are as follows:</p>
<p>CI = Imf T = low frequency transformer</p>
<p>C2 = .5mf V = 3o vacuum tube</p>
<p>C3 = .25mf R = 2o ohm variable filament regulator</p>
<p>C4 = .Imf RI = five-section wire-wound fixed resistor</p>
<p>C5 = o5mf·Each section is 100,000 ohms (see Figure 2)</p>
<p>C6 = .o25mf·</p>
<p>C7 = .oI5mf·</p>
<p>C8 = .oIm·</p>
<p>C9 = .oo5mf·</p>
<p>CIo = .ooImf·</p>
<p>CII = .ooo6Imf·</p>
<p>CI2 = .ooo25mf·</p>
<h3>Simple AC Voltage Controller</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>In the city's power supply, the voltage often fluctuates day and night due to the different power consumption of users. The voltage fluctuation has a great impact on the radio's reception; Moreover, excessively high voltage can cause the vacuum tube to break, or the screen current to be too large and damage it. Therefore, it should be controlled to prevent accidents. Now, a simple and economical AC voltage controller is introduced. The method is simple, and comrades who love radio can make it themselves. Please refer to the attached diagram. Wind forty turns of No. 16 double yarn-covered wire densely on a bakelite tube (it is better to apply a layer of varnish on the coil to increase insulation). Connect one end of the two wire ends to the transformer and the other end to the power supply. Then, use a soft iron rod of appropriate size, or a long screw nut nail can also be used, and insert it into the bakelite tube. If the external voltage drops, remove the iron rod; If the external voltage rises, insert the iron rod, so that this simple device completes the work of the choke coil. The number of turns of the coil is not necessarily limited to forty turns, depending on how the local voltage changes; It can be less than forty turns, or more than forty turns, or connect the center tap. In short, adjust the appropriate voltage to keep the secondary coil voltage of the power transformer at a constant specified value, so that the radio's reception is satisfactory and the vacuum tube is not damaged.</p>
<h3>Distortion</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanchang</p>
<p>Apart from specially designed radios in high-rise buildings, distortion is a very common phenomenon in radios made by amateur enthusiasts. Radio operators do not need to pay attention to this phenomenon, but amateurs must pay attention if they want to improve the sound quality.</p>
<p>So let's first ask: is the radio stable? If there is a high-frequency amplification stage, does it tend to oscillate when turned to a radio station? This unpleasant high-pitched "hissing" sound makes the music turn into a whistling and hurried sound.</p>
<p>The modification method is to modify the high-frequency amplification stage or add a shielding cover, but simply rearranging the component layout, such as the coil angle and main wiring, will do. The instability of high-frequency amplification is only a problem of layout and position design, not due to a special state.</p>
<p>It is impossible for the coil and capacitor in the high-frequency amplification stage to still be unstable after using a shielding cover.</p>
<p>Distortion is more common in the low-frequency amplification than in the high-frequency amplification.</p>
<p>When using two stages of low-frequency amplification, or using a pentode as the output in the final stage, it is best to use resistance coupling.</p>
<p>Vacuum tube overload can also cause distortion, and incorrect B voltage is also a reason.</p>
<p>Each vacuum tube must have its correct plate voltage and grid voltage, so the instructions specified in the instruction manual must be noted. A certain B voltage should use a certain C voltage to save plate power and the sound is clear.</p>
<p>If the B voltage of the vacuum tube is sufficient, it is also necessary to pay attention to whether the C voltage can work. Ordinary C voltage can last for six to eight months (referring to foreign batteries, domestic products cannot be used for so long in comparison). Otherwise, use a meter to measure it before using it.</p>
<p>Excessive output can also cause distortion, so only reduce its volume or use a vacuum tube with a larger output power. In other words, use a powerful tube instead. The C voltage value used for this type of vacuum tube is higher, so the plate current also increases accordingly.</p>
<p>Many amateurs tend to use high-ratio transformers. This hope is sometimes hit hard because the amplification efficiency has a certain limit before it is stable without distortion. Therefore, it is better to use a lower ratio for low-frequency amplification with two-stage transformer coupling.</p>
<p>For low-frequency amplification with two transformer couplings, grounding the transformer core and appropriately spacing the wiring positions can prevent instability.</p>
<p>Inferior transformers also have poor frequency characteristics, which often cause distortion. Therefore, it is best to use cheap goods less.</p>
<p>As for using a three-circuit regenerative radio or excessive regeneration, excessive B voltage can also easily cause distortion. At that time, just reduce the B voltage or reduce the regeneration to prevent it.</p>
<p>If amateurs can pay attention to the above points, the drawbacks of distortion can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Obtaining Ether</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Radio waves must have a medium for propagation in the air. This medium is hypothetically named "ether" in radio science. However, the so-called ether is completely a hypothetical term. There is no way to answer what its shape and nature are. Even whether it exists is still a question. Countless great scientists have exhausted their brains and done tens of millions of experiments to prove the existence of this ether and express its characteristics, but they have ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Recently, Professor Vaclavposjpa of Prague University in the capital of Czechoslovakia is confident that he has obtained the fleeting image of ether. He imagines that ether must contain a large group of atomic particles, similar to the central nucleus of oxygen atoms, but without charge. He once placed a thin wire made of steel (one of the metal elements) in a completely vacuum tube, and tried to heat it, and its resistance can be measured before and after heating. The experimental results showed that the oxygen nuclei in the tube dispersed and gathered on the palladium wire. Professor Pospěch is convinced that this stored particle is ether. Professor AimeCotton of the University of Paris also said that ether can be obtained by dispersing water molecules in a vacuum.</p>
<h3>Improvement of a New Type of Power-Saving Single-Tube Machine</h3>
<p>— Ma Xixian</p>
<p>I am most interested in experimenting with new vacuum tubes, so after reading Si Lianjun's single IA6 tube machine in the last issue, I immediately went to get one to try. As a result, the volume was of course louder, but the sensitivity and selectivity were still not satisfactory, so after many disassembly and reassembly, I changed it to a single-tube three-use machine with one stage of high-frequency amplification, one stage of detection, and one stage of low-frequency amplification. Its performance is really amazing. When receiving large and small radio stations in this city, almost no antenna is needed, so it is best to install it in a suitcase as a travel machine.</p>

<h3>Pocket AC Radio</h3>
<p>— Wang Caiwen</p>
<p>This so-called pocket radio is not small enough to be hidden in a pocket, but its size can be said to be much smaller than any small radio in the past.</p>
<p>When I started designing this radio, my goal was to minimize it as much as possible, and I didn't have time to consider efficiency, but the result was unexpectedly beautiful, so I especially introduce it here.</p>
<p>Because the purpose of this radio is to be small, all vacuum tubes are the latest type. Secondly, if ordinary variable capacitors are used, they will take up a lot of space, so new variable capacitors are used. This new variable capacitor has a capacitance of 0.00033, a thickness of only 15 mm, and a width of 63 mm, which is much smaller than before.</p>
<p>The branch capacitor is an 8uf electrolytic type. The low-frequency choke coil used in the filter is not used, but a German-style resistor is used instead. The detection uses a No. 57 industrial tube, which has very good efficiency when used for grid detection at low voltage, and the current consumption is small. The list of parts used in the whole machine is as follows:</p>
<h3>Coil</h3>
<p>L1 25 turns on a one-inch cylinder</p>
<p>L2 115 turns of 30 gauge enameled wire</p>
<p>L3 415 turns</p>
<p>Capacitors (unit uf)</p>
<p>VC1 VC2 new variable capacitor as mentioned above Co·ooo25 grid capacitor C2o·oo1 C3o·1 C4o·o1 C51·o</p>
<p>C68·o C72·o C88·o</p>
<h3>Resistors (unit ohms)</h3>
<p>R1 500,000 to 2 meg</p>
<p>R2 2 meg to 3 meg</p>
<p>R3 300,000 to 500,000</p>
<p>R4 1 meg to 2 meg</p>
<p>R6 50,000 R7 30,000 RCH 1 omh</p>
<p>RT secondary winding</p>
<p>200 volts 30 amps</p>
<p>5 volts 0.5 amps</p>
<p>2.5 volts 3 amps</p>
<p>V1 UZ57</p>
<p>V2 UY27A or UY227A</p>
<p>V3 KX12B</p>
<p>If you use 227B instead of V2 27A, although the efficiency is better, its shape is slightly larger, so it is sometimes inconvenient to use.</p>
<p>Adjustment and sensitivity</p>
<p>The thing that feels uneasy when looking at this circuit is the problem of AC hum, because C6 and C8 have large capacitance, and the values of R6 and R7 are too large, so the AC hum caused by ripple is not a problem. What must be noted is the AC hum caused by induction. The initial experiment felt very annoying. When the earpiece was hanging on the ear, the oh-oh sound occurred terribly. Later, after various changes, this noise was finally eliminated.</p>
<p>The sensitivity is quite good. It is really amazing that such a small radio can be heard so clearly. Readers may wish to try it.</p>

<p>The reputation of Patterson radios. The manager of the Arctic Electric Refrigerator Company, Patterson radios, received a letter from a user a few years ago proving the effectiveness as follows: Dear Sir, I was told by a friend on May 28 that I had the first opportunity to listen to the direct broadcast program of the American NBC Broadcasting Radio Station from BoundBrook, New Jersey. I was very happy. My friend installed a Patterson eight-tube radio. After it was discovered at 11 pm that day, I was immediately notified. The one I prepared was also a Patterson eight-tube machine, so there was no difficulty in receiving the station. The broadcast program continued for about an hour. The music, talks, and other programs broadcast were powerful and clear through 2SA5, R6NN. I am writing to inform you and share it with fellow enthusiasts. Respectfully yours, Tang Mansion, No. 537 Wuchang Road.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance. Silver futures fell, and the gold standard rebounded by 1.2 yuan. Low premium is unfavorable news. The firm and stable situation eventually became weak.</h3>
<p>The gold market plummeted yesterday due to the sudden drop in silver prices, and short sellers generally became pessimistic. The market rose as soon as it opened, but because banks stuffed out hedging and arbitrage, foreign countries were unwilling to pay war debts, and the swap rate became cheaper, the market was extremely weak in the end. In the early morning, the overseas silver market shrank slightly, and the US silver market was flat. The forward silver price on the gold and silver exchange fell by 2.8 to 4.1 cents, the exchange rate rose slightly, London raw gold fell by 5 pence, US cotton fell by 19 pounds, US wheat shrank by another 2 cents, stocks fell by 1.6 yuan, and the initial price of goods was 18 yuan for preliminary trading, and the opening price also rose to 17 yuan. Overnight short sellers mutually made up their positions, and the situation was stable. After the opening, the bank's appetite tilted out, and the process hardened, so there was an appearance of oversupply. The HSBC listed price for British and American currency was flat and gradually decreased. People's hearts were still calm, and there was a lot of struggle in the middle, because the bank was still accepting forward US dollars. However, the trend of the exchange market eventually hardened. Reuters called and transferred European countries, saying that they had sent letters to the United States stating that it was difficult to fulfill their war debts due tomorrow. The market situation became weak again. Later, there were more people buying on dips, and there was a rebound. Although the report of the night silver price in Seattle came, the market was extremely calm with a message of decreasing 125.625.375. It hovered at the sight of five yuan. Although it declined slightly before noon, it was still able to rebound after being low. It was extremely mediocre. Later, the night silver price in Seattle rebounded by 25.25 and no change, although it did not have a big impact, but because the swap was prepaid, only 1.5 yuan was added by the bulls, and people's hearts turned weak. As soon as the market opened, it frustrated. Later, it was rumored that the United States would issue silver certificates after the Congress was closed. The domestic market hardened. The industry generally speculated that the price was too cheap, and generally many bulls switched positions. In addition, the swap rate became cheaper, and there was an oversupply in the market. However, the buying power was still strong after the low, and it was still able to pull up. The market situation was mediocre. The swap for this session, the market initially shouted 2 yuan, the official opening price was 5 corners for the bulls to pay, the closing price was 3 corners, and finally the flat swap was made. The red gold price was 1027.5 yuan. Today, after recording the market situation for a day,</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 1017.5 yuan, which was 7.1 yuan higher than the previous close. The opening price of goods was 7.4 yuan. The exchange market's morning opening price for the near-term selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 625, and the US exchange rate was 33 yuan. After the opening, Shanghai and Citibank stuffed out US dollars for July 0625, and Bankgen, Sumitomo, Shanghai, and Banque Belge stuffed out US dollars for August 1875. Dachengyu, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Shunli, Yuqingyong, Hengtai, and others all came to sell, and retreated from the upper corner of seven yuan to the sight of six yuan. At this time, Qianchangxiang and Yukang limited the board to enter, and there was still struggle.

The interbank lending rate for foreign banks saw further weakness, dropping an additional 0.03, totaling 0.05. The morning and afternoon markets were similar, with no additional water added to the clearing amounts, generally resulting in plain clearing.

Afternoon and small general association transactions each exceeded 400,000. Pledge transactions from foreign banks, normally with significant activity near the end of the month, are now experiencing a lack of willingness to engage due to the uncertain production and sales prospects, fearing oversupply, resulting in few dares to provide pledges, and leading to scarce transactions. Yesterday, redemptions exceeded 500,000, with only slightly more than 900,000 in new pledges. Banknote withdrawals and issuances totaled 1.7 to 1.8 million, customer sources reached 200,000, and cash payments were 500,000 in cash and 300,000 in banknotes.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Continue to Reach New Highs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the Sino-Japanese issue became easier to resolve following the discovery of hidden capital. Mr. Huang Fu is also planning to go north, and the thorns ahead are gradually being removed. In addition, the establishment of the Construction Bank Company is imminent, which has absorbed various bonds. Market sentiment is high, the highest ever, and the financial community is showing particular interest. The gold short bond rose sharply after breaking through the 72 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 73 yuan. Other bonds such as the Consolidated Salt Tax and the Sixth Series also continued to reach new highs. The market conditions were excellent, with no signs of weakness. The 75 yuan gold short bond is also approaching. Consolidated Salt Tax is expected to reach 70%, which is very close. Judging from the large-scale purchases by No. 32 yesterday, there is no sign of satisfaction, and it can be expected that there will be special new highs in the future. The silver market is loose and the arbitrage is surging. The previous statement was not a fantasy. Yesterday's progress: The market was initially stable, but after the gold short bond rose by 0.03, it quickly broke through the 72 yuan mark, and market sentiment turned激昂 again.

In the afternoon, when the market opened, No. 20's interest was even stronger, and the demobilization bond rose by 0.04. The gold short bond reached a new high of 73 yuan. The salt tax reached 56.5 yuan, and the interest from many parties seemed to be still in full swing. At the close, No. 48 made slight sales, but all parties were buying. The long positions on the table slightly decreased, and the market price only dropped by 0.05 to 0.1. The good market conditions made the short positions have no way out, and the delivery period is gradually approaching, so the short positions still face danger in the future. In summary, the market prices all continued to rise, from 0.02 to 0.03 to about one yuan. The total turnover was estimated to be about 25 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Scarce, Yarn and Cotton Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak due to falling foreign cotton prices. Spot yarn sales are quite sluggish. It is found that only about 200 packs were bought by various parties throughout the day. This kind of sluggish business situation has been the case for many days, so people are depressed. However, the attitude of the buyers is still calm. It is expected that there will be development in the actual sales after the festival, so there should be a change in the market after the festival.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Loosens</h3>
<p>The opening of the forward yarn market was affected by the fall in US cotton and the closing of Guangbang on the previous day, causing people to feel loose. The prices for each month fell by 0.02 to 0.03 to 0.05 to 0.06. In the second and third rounds, it was heard that the Tianjin Bang had interest in spot yarn. At the same time, short sellers came in, and the market suddenly rebounded. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06. In the afternoon, the market suddenly turned weak, and the selling wind started slightly. This was because the Tianjin Bang only bought dozens of packs of spot yarn on the previous day, and the price of Japanese yarn fell by two yuan. Therefore, the situation changed again. In short, the transaction of cotton yarn was not smooth, and the prices for each month fell again by 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 42,600 packs. It was found that 500 packs of Da Ji, 1,150 packs of Da Feng, 700 packs of Yuan Da, 700 packs of Tai Xing, 1,150 packs of Geng Feng, 600 packs of Chang Yu, 2,750 packs of Heng Chang, 500 packs of Xie Sheng, and 500 packs of De Ji were sold. 750 packs of Da Chang, 650 packs of Chang Feng, 550 packs of Shen Ji, 750 packs of Jin Chang, 1,000 packs of Tong Ji, 1,500 packs of Chun Ji, and 2,550 packs of Da Ji were bought.

<p>North Bang 10, Inland 85, Ningbo 1, Fujian 15</p>
<p>Tianjin 50, Changsha 20, Shantou 45</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak because US cotton is falling. The strong bulls have completely let go. However, a certain bank bought more than 40,000 bales, but it has not been released at a high price. Therefore, the air in the market is still strong. However, the yarn market is not good, and the demand for spot cotton is less. It is found that the goods that have passed the inspection of the inspection office this month are said to have 45,000 bales. Therefore, the market is weaker.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Weak State</h3>
<p>The forward cotton market opened and fell with US cotton. There were not many buyers in the market. Only a certain bull bought the limit price of 5.03 this month, and the distant months were tightened by it. In the second and third rounds, the yarn market brought it up.

<p>Total 796,300</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Factories Don't Open</h3>
<p>The spot cotton sales market is very sparse, and the factory taste is very dull. Because the yarn market has turned down again, the intention to handle raw materials is particularly weak. Moreover, the number of people who reduce working hours and stop working is gradually increasing. The source is estimated to be 550 packs of Tonghua and 200 packs of Yaohua.</p>

New wheat arrived and sales were strong, but the market was quite stable. The high-quality Mingguang wheat opened at 2.09 yuan, the middle at 2.07 to 2.08 yuan, and the second at 2.064 yuan. It is estimated that 2,100 packs were sold by Fuxin, 700 packs were sold by Fufeng, and 500 packs were sold by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Market Slightly Transferred</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of each party is still only No. 27 to 28 (3,000 to 4,000 people), but there are quite a lot of late rice among them, accounting for a fraction of them. Although the North China Party's stomach can continue to run smoothly, its eating plate is therefore tighter. The seller made a move, but in the end it was difficult to achieve results. For example, more than 2,000 packs of Qingjiao Songsi Liantang and other goods have all turned into a fixed plate, and the stomach of each thick japonica rice shop has been able to move slightly, and the situation seems to be tighter, but the price has not risen or fallen, and Duyang Jian is still flat. Yin Yuan has not been opened, and Bian Yuan has continued to decline.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various roads in Hexia was No. 15 to 16. Various sales channels in the market, white japonica high materials are normal, the middle and second continue to change, white yuan has a little transaction, early thin rice and various indica are flat and dull, the market is high white japonica fixed, the middle and second are slightly tight, white yuan has a slight ups and downs, and the early thin rice and various indica are fixed.</p>
<h3>Static Guest Indica</h3>
<p>Yesterday's guest indica market, both arrival and sales were weak. Because all parties are preparing for the festival, they have no intention of buying and selling. The entrants intend to buy small again, but the owners are determined and do not want to devalue the price slightly. It is estimated that the Minbang will first launch after the festival, and this street and the Zhejiang Bang also have the need to ask. At present, there are few entries and exits, and it is estimated that it will only be active after the festival. Yesterday, the whole city only received 50 packs of Hunan machine red rice and 66 packs of Jingmi. There were no other deliveries. The scattered numbers opened were temporary transactions on this street, not formal market, and although the price was slightly smaller, the market was flat.</p>
<h3>New Wan Beans Are Also on the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new Wan beans were also on the market. 73 packs of Wuhu Tangwan and 50 packs of Jiangbei small Wan arrived. In terms of products, Wuhu products are good in body and both. The identity is above 95. Jiangbei products are slightly inferior, all handled by foreign banks. Wuhu products are opened at 3.03 yuan and Jiangbei products are 2.085 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Bang took it away, and the source is slightly scarce below. Moreover, most of the high-quality goods are transferred from the ship to the stack, and the cargo owners intend to sell, so the market may be fixed.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea New Cocoons Transported to Shanghai Silk Factory Opens</h3>
<p>(25 Factories Have Arrived in Shanghai) There were originally 113 single and double palace silk factories in Shanghai. In recent years, overseas silk sales have plummeted, and silk prices have plummeted. Factories that went bankrupt are frequently heard of. Before the new cocoons were launched, only 11 or 12 factories worked hard. This year, Jiangsu and Zhejiang spring silkworms have reported a bumper harvest. Improved seed cocoons are of good quality and the price is not high. The cocoon market ended one after another. New dry cocoons were transported to Shanghai one after another. Each silk factory in the city has started work one after another. Now 25 factories in Shanghai have started running, including Yunchang, Yichang 1.2.3, Zhengda, Jiyu, Gongda, Fengji, Yuanji, Fuchang, Yutong, Gongji, Fengtai, Fulunheng, Xuxing, Xianglun, Yufeng, Tongyi, Tongwei, Jinyun, and Chuxin. There are still several factories such as Baotai and Xinchang. They are currently repairing locomotives and will start work within a few days.</p>
<p>(Overseas Factory Price Survey) In the overseas market, Japanese silk merchants actively sold cheap Japanese new silk, resulting in extremely sluggish Chinese silk market. The current market price of Grade B white factory warp, "New York" 80% evenness, 20 to 22 yarns is only 456 to 460 yuan. "Lyon" 13 to 15 yarns is only 520 to 530 yuan. The cost of new silk for each manufacturer is 550 to 560 yuan. It is difficult to sell at a loss, and the Shanghai market is still stalled.</p>
<p>(Double Palace Silk Indian Demand Still Strong) Recently, the demand for double palace silk printing is still strong. Previously, there was also 23 packs of double palace silk exported on the British mail ship Laval Soldier Brothers, which was transported to India via the UK.</p>
<p>(Electro-transferred Factory Warp Price Still Small) In the European and American raw silk market, the current silk factory entry is still sluggish, and silk prices are hovering. Although each European bank received an overseas account yesterday morning, the white factory warp price is still small. The negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties are still suspended by 40 to 50 yuan, and it is difficult to comply. Yesterday, the silk factory entered 5 packs each of yellow factory warp and white dry warp, and the price was still flat and weak.</p>

<h3>Snacks</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhen</p>
<p>The current state of the publishing industry, with many periodicals and few specialized books, makes those with a heart worry, and many small pieces and few great works also make those with a heart worry. People with a heart really have to "sit in the city of sorrow" every day.</p>
<p>However, this situation has been going on for a long time, and now it is only slightly changed and more obvious.</p>
<p>The residents of Shanghai have always liked to eat snacks. If you listen carefully, the snack vendors outside the house are always "really busy". Osmanthus white sugar London cake, lard white sugar lotus seed porridge, shrimp meat wonton noodles, sesame bananas, Nanyang mangoes, West Road honey oranges, melon seed kings, as well as candied fruits, olives, etc., etc., as long as you have a good appetite, you can eat from morning to midnight, but it doesn't matter if you don't have a good appetite, because it's not like fatty fish and big meat, and the portion is very small. The effect is that in leisure, you get the benefits of Lilian, and the taste is good.</p>
<p>The publications of the past few years are snacks that "benefit health", or "introduction", or "ABC", or "overview". In short, it is a thin book, as long as you spend a few cents and spend half an hour, you can understand a kind of science, or a complete literature, or a kind of foreign language. The meaning is that as long as you eat a pack of five-spice melon seeds, you can make this person flourish and grow, which is worth eating for five years. After trying it for a few years, the effect was not obvious, so I felt a little discouraged. If the test is inconsistent with the name, it is often inevitable to be discouraged. For example, there are now very few people who practice immortality or refine gold, and instead use Haoquan and buy lottery tickets, which is the result of ineffective testing. So it was released. The "health" side has been moved to the "taste good" side. Naturally, snacks are still snacks. Residents of Shanghai cannot be separated from snacks even if they die.</p>
<p>So small pieces appeared, but it was not a new pattern. When the business of Lao Jiuzhang was booming, there was a "Grand View of Notes and Novels", which was a large box of snacks; after Lao Jiuzhang closed, it naturally became a small pinch. The portion is smaller, so why is it so noisy and raging, causing a storm in the city? I think this is because a signboard with a seal character and a Roman alphabet combined with a New Year red electric light is installed on the load.</p>
<p>However, although it is still a snack, the Shanghai residents' sensitivity is more agile than before, otherwise why would it be noisy? But this may be due to neurasthenia. If so, then the future of snacks is worrying.</p>
<h3>What is Literary Chinese?</h3>
<p>— Cao Qiren</p>
<p>"…Once vernacular Chinese becomes popular throughout the country, and everyone can use writing to express their ideas to some extent, then the extraordinary skills that the scholar class has always possessed will have no place to be used… The popularization of Chinese characters, on the one hand, provides the people with a new tool to express their thoughts, allowing tens of millions of previously silent people to express their simple ideas after learning three to five hundred characters; on the other hand, it deprives the scholar class of their only weapon… It is not without awareness that the old gentlemen oppose vernacular Chinese; it is precisely their last struggle, the final brilliance of their lives."</p>
<p>丨丨Tao Menghe: The Scholar Class Someone told me: "'Literary Chinese Revival', 'Elementary School Classics', there are people advocating, echoing, the noise is deafening, the restoration movement is really afraid it will become a reality," I smiled without answering, and asked him to show me the articles of the advocates. I said: What they themselves do, can it be considered Literary Chinese? The world is so bizarre, those who yearn for Literary Chinese, their illness lies in not understanding at all "what is Literary Chinese?" This kind of "New Citizen Journal" style of writing, not only would the orthodox Tongcheng school disdain it, even seeds of culture must shake their heads and sigh at it as a great calamity for the world and people's hearts (see Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao), and they are complacent thinking that what they do is Literary Chinese, isn't that a big joke! Just saying that advocating Literary Chinese revival is stubborn and conservative is not enough to convince their hearts, I will calmly talk about the so-called "essence of Literary Chinese". I think, those who advocate Literary Chinese revival should adhere to the Tongcheng school's claims, that is their old master. Among the four disciples of Yao Nai of the Tongcheng school, Fang Dongshu was the most cautious, let's see what he said: "The writing of the three dynasties gradually declined in style, the times made it so. Moreover, in recent times, ancient teachings are rarely understood, rather than writing in a way that people do not understand, why not use what is commonly understood and make it easy to understand?" (Explanation of the Book Forest) Under Zeng Guofan's command, Wu Jifu (Rulun) had the highest attainment in learning ancient prose, let's listen to his argument: "China cannot popularize education without abolishing Han Chinese; because Han Chinese is too difficult, people learn it from a young age, and it is impossible to become refined and admirable without decades of hard work, and by then people are old and useless, this is why our country's scholarship is not as advanced as the West." Mr. Xu Binbin said it well: "People are neither new nor old, as long as they are clear about the principles of things, they will naturally have a fair and pertinent argument." Those who love to drive backwards are mostly ignorant fools who forget their ancestors and do not understand the principles of things!</p>
<p>Opposing "Literary Chinese" and "Vernacular Chinese", thinking that the two are absolutely incompatible; they think they have seized that camp, raised the banner, and opposed the Vernacular Chinese camp, this is the root of all wrong ideas. Language and writing are produced in the community, used in the community, and are always in a constant process of change and selection, trying to intercept the language of a certain time and place, calling it Literary Chinese, calling it ancient Chinese, that is absolutely impossible. Liu Zhifan said: "As time passes, customs are impermanent, later generations will look at the present as the present looks at the past; but writers are all afraid to write in the language of today, and bravely imitate the language of the past, isn't that a delusion!" He also said: "The theories of the Three Commentaries are not familiar with the Book of Documents, and the words of the Han Dynasty often contradict the strategies of the Warring States, enough to verify the gradual changes in popular customs, and to know the differences in the times. But later writers have no foresight, record the spoken language of their time, rarely write truthfully, and then imitate the people of the past, showing their antiquarianism. This makes the language of the Zhou and Qin dynasties appear in the Wei and Jin dynasties, and the responses of the Chu and Han dynasties are used in the Song and Qi dynasties, falsely repairing chaos, losing their naturalness, the present and the past are impure because of this, and the true and the false are confused by their mutual mixing. We use a historical perspective to observe the changes in language and writing, and we know that the words "Literary Chinese" cannot be established at all, what they are based on is a dreamlike state, there is no actual camp, what can they use to oppose "Vernacular Chinese"!</p>
<p>Originally, Chinese language and writing took the Qin Dynasty as a dividing line. Before the Qin Dynasty, various ethnic groups managed their own cultures and used their own dialects to write articles, what is called ancient Zhou and Qin writings today, were in fact dialect writings at the time. To describe the beauty of a person, the Shanghai dialect is "pretty", using it in writing, those who advocate Literary Chinese always think it is too vulgar, and must change it to "graceful" or "beautiful" to be ancient and elegant. But the Erya says: "Graceful, beautiful. Between Song, Wei, Jin, and Zheng is called beautiful, between Chen, Chu, Zhou, and South is called graceful." It is precisely the dialect of that time; must abandoning "pretty" and take "beautiful" or "graceful", isn't that knowing two fives but not knowing one ten? Early people's affairs are simple, and characters were first used to describe meaning with one character (same as foreign tribes, East is called Yi, West is called Rong, South is called Man, North is called Di). As human affairs gradually become complicated, the number of characters increases day by day, which is very difficult to remember, and naturally tends towards the new path of using words. The tendency to use words gradually sprouted between the Zhou and Qin dynasties, and became more obvious after the Han Dynasty, single characters were abandoned and compound words rose again, from simple to complex, the trend is inevitable. Since the Han and Jin Dynasties, the increase in compound words is directly proportional to the times, and vernacular Chinese is purely using compound words. What those who advocate Literary Chinese yearn for is nothing more than the simplicity of using single characters in ancient times, but they do not know that the ancients were suffering from the inadequacy of simplicity! Yuan Zhonglang's Snow Waves Pavilion Preface says: "The ancient times had their own times, and the present times have their own times. To imitate the traces of ancient people's language and think it is ancient is like wearing summer clothes in severe winter." Yuan Boxiu's Essay on Collecting Bai Su says: "The round-collared robe of today is to learn from the ancient people's covering themselves with leaves. Today's five-flavored decoction is to learn from the ancient people's eating raw meat and drinking blood. The ancient people's intention was to satisfy their hunger and cover their bodies, and today's people's intention is also to satisfy their hunger and cover their bodies, there is no difference. Those who pick ancient people's words and phrases to put into their own works are no different from sewing leaves into their sleeves or throwing hair into the meat. Generally speaking, the writing of the ancients was dedicated to being clear, while the writing of today's people is dedicated to being unclear, learning to be clear from being unclear, can this be called learning from the ancients? Their words are the right medicine for those who advocate Literary Chinese revival!</p>
<p>Those who advocate Literary Chinese must speak highly of ancient Han and Wei prose, praising Sima Qian to the skies. If they were in Sima Qian's time, they should at least revive the writing of the Yin and Zhou Dynasties. But when Sima Qian wrote the Basic Annals of the Five Emperors, he translated the Shang Shu's "sincerely ordering the hundred officials, and the many achievements are all glorious" into "sincerely admonishing the officials, all the achievements are flourishing." Isn't that abolishing Literary Chinese and using Han Dynasty vernacular? Gao Yao said: "The people are submerged in darkness, I ride in four vehicles, follow the mountains to cut wood, and give to the Qin people fresh food." Isn't that simple and ancient, but the Historical Records' Basic Annals of Xia must change it to "The people are all afflicted by the water, I travel on land by carriage, travel on water by boat, travel on mud by sled, travel on mountains to cut wood and give to my people, so that the people have rice and fresh food." Isn't that abandoning simplicity for complexity, admitting that the language of today is superior to the language of the past? Those who advocate Literary Chinese must admire Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi, thinking that the ancient prose of the Tang and Song dynasties is completely beautiful and perfect. Han Yu's Epitaph for Fan Shaoshu says: "Only by being ancient can one necessarily be strange, and those who descend cannot be strange. Song Qi liked ancient characters, and Ouyang Xiu leisurely slept and recorded auspicious signs, Zhalan Hong teased him with eight characters." The ancient prose writers of the Tang and Song dynasties were critical of the literati of the time for liking to use ancient language (just as people today like to use Literary Chinese), artificially creating, so they replaced it with "plain writing" (the name ancient prose was created by the people of the Ming Dynasty. The literati of the Tang and Song dynasties all called it plain writing, plain writing is plain and clear writing, just like novels have plain speech). If Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan were to be reborn in this world, they would definitely denounce the revival of Literary Chinese as... Those who advocate Literary Chinese must follow the Tongcheng school, and the Tongcheng school takes Gui Youguang as its ancestor, before Fang and Yao, there were Gu Tinglin and Wei Xi and others who continued it. Gu Tinglin's Daily Knowledge Records' criticism of literati seeking ancient ways says: "The Post Zhou Book's Biography of Xiong Tuo says: 'People at that time discussed the difference between ancient and modern styles of writing, Tuo thought that "times have ancient and modern, not writing has ancient and modern." This is the most appropriate argument. It is like the Han cannot do Shang. To copy or imitate the way of the Han Dynasty to replace... the two words of... in writing, is particularly inappropriate. To consider today's land as not ancient, and to borrow ancient land names; to consider today's officials as not ancient, and to borrow ancient official names; to abandon the commonly used characters of today, and to borrow the commonly used things of ancient times, are all ways for literati to exhaust their vulgarity." I don't know what those who advocate Literary Chinese revival think after reading it? What makes Gui Youguang different from the Seven Masters Before and After is that the Seven Masters Before and After intended to make fake antiques, failing to draw a tiger, becoming clumsy instead: Gui Youguang started with being plain and approachable, and unexpectedly entered a better state. The Tongcheng school advocates using the elegant words of the scholar-official class, and must use the current system for times and places, officials and institutions, focusing the collection and commentary of large and small chapters on one central point, its intention is to correct the mistakes of the restoration concepts of the Seven Masters Before and After, to make it easier for those who study writing to understand, and to adapt to the times, how can one "live in today's world" and practice the ways of the ancient world? The above discussion is all old news, it was unnecessary to say it again. I am only like a teacher who has taken in a few inferior students, repeatedly instructing them earnestly, hoping that they will neither mislead themselves, nor mislead the people of the world. Most importantly, they should understand that there is no such thing as Literary Chinese, they should not dream anymore, or talk in their sleep! (Adu, Ningxin, old literati called Literary Chinese writing; these are all earthy words of the Jin people (Adu) is like saying (this), "Ningxin" is like saying "like this". Historical Records, describes Zhou Bo's stuttering, so it says: "Your subject thinks it is impossible again and again," old literati then used "thinks it is impossible again and again" as Literary Chinese. The sage said, to know is to know, to not know is to not know, this is knowledge, those who don't understand what Literary Chinese is, better keep your mouth shut!)</p>
<h3>Gejiu Mine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>The cave is very stuffy, and with each person going in to carry ore, with a burning gas lamp stuck in their head, the air in the cave is almost entirely thick carbon gas, and by the time they carry the ore out, their faces have turned pale and they are panting heavily, throwing the two heavy bags of ore onto the ground, and leaning against the carrying pole as if they are about to die.</p>
<p>I was stunned when I saw this pitiful sight. I, a twelve or thirteen-year-old child, have come all the way here away from my parents, isn't it also to do this inhuman work?</p>
<p>I felt sad and wanted to cry, but I didn't dare. I silently followed the "water carrier" acquaintance, from this gang's shack to that gang's shack, stepping on piles of ore, walking past with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>On the way, he told me that those who carry ore are doing "grass skin work", and those who climb into the cave are "off-shift"...</p>
<p>"Do you want to do grass skin work? Or off-shift?" he suddenly asked me. "Those who do grass skin work have to carry all day, those who are off-shift only need to carry enough a few buckets of ore a day. Which do you prefer?"</p>
<p>I was afraid and didn't answer him.</p>
<p>He led me to a shack in Huazhakou. A big black dog rushed towards us fiercely, but was stopped by the people in the shack. The dogs here are mostly so fierce, the "water carrier" acquaintance said.</p>
<p>After eating in the shack, (the rice was coarse rice mixed with sand and gravel, the only dish was a pot of "Old Mother Soup") the "water carrier" acquaintance introduced me to the boss, and also said that I could work off-shift, and the wages were negotiable…</p>
<p>The boss looked at me over his pipe and chuckled: "Okay, you can learn tomorrow!"</p>
<p>After the boss said that, I felt a different kind of sadness in my heart!</p>
<p>That night, I hid under the blanket, without letting anyone know, and quietly shed a few tears of sorrow!</p>
<p>This place is a living hell: with inhuman cruelty, tyrannical exploitation, and dark oppression. If I hadn't come here, how would I have known?</p>
<h3>Guiying's Dad (2)</h3>
<p>— Yezi</p>
<p>So I didn't go downstairs much. Whenever my wife and they had nothing to say or do, I would go to bed and sleep, temporarily leaving the loneliness outside the mosquito net.</p>
<p>After half a month of this, I discovered Guiying's dad as if I had found a treasure.</p>
<p>I had known about Guiying's dad for a long time. Guiying and my wife's two elder sisters were classmates and very good friends, and they were also neighbors. Guiying's house was only separated from the hotel by two other houses. Guiying married a Nanjing man and lived in Shanghai. Only her elderly father and mother were left at home. Her mother was friends with my mother-in-law, and the reason why my mother-in-law was willing to marry her youngest daughter to me, this "outsider", was decided after being persuaded by Guiying's mom. Therefore, Guiying's mom often treated us as benefactors, telling us not to forget her. On this point, I was certainly grateful to her, but in fact, I had more hatred than gratitude for her. She was very ugly, with sparse hair, disheveled and uncombed. One of her eyes was blind, but that one lonely bright eye held a lot of fierceness, as if it had also combined the fierceness that the blind eye should have. Her face was yellow with a hint of green, but it was matched with a blood-basin-like big mouth, in which there was only one upper incisor. She bared this dagger-like incisor, specializing in cursing the streets and stirring up trouble. People on half a street had a wary attitude towards her. She didn't laugh often, but when she laughed, her mouth opened wider, her incisor was more exposed, and her appearance became more terrifying. Her left hand was numb, and she always had her right hand supporting it. There was also something wrong with her feet, and she walked with a limp. She always wore a set of dirty and smelly black clothes, which made people sick. All of this made her into a ghostly figure. Only my mother-in-law was quite close to her, and believed her words. Other than that, no one had a good impression of her.</p>
<p>Not only outsiders, but even her own daughter, Guiying, had a very bad feeling towards her. Guiying was a capable woman. She worked outside, and always sent more than ten dollars a month to her parents' home, but her good intentions were very painful. Once, we met her in Shanghai, and when we talked about the situation at home, she said sadly:</p>
<p>"It's very difficult for me. It's not good not to send this money, and it's not good to send it either. I originally wanted to send the money to my dad for him to use. My dad has always treated me well, and he is too hardworking and too pitiful. He is over sixty years old, and he is still selling sesame cakes and kudzu starch jelly, and ever since my brother passed away, he has been mourning so much that he has almost gone crazy, and he has become terribly decadent. Now his only hope is me, I must comfort him... I send ten dollars a month, and he could have stopped doing business. However, my mom is really too greedy. She hides all the money I send, and doesn't give a penny to my dad. She still forces my dad to do business. She knows how to enjoy herself very well, and she can't eat without fish and meat every day, but she doesn't let my dad enjoy it with her, leaving him only bones and soup. This situation is really tragic to talk about! Sometimes, I can't stand it and want to stop sending money. I remember how my mother used to mistreat me. When I lost my job, she didn't even allow me to eat a mouthful of rice at home, forcing me to go outside. Fortunately, I had good luck and got help from my friends, and I actually graduated from high school, married a husband, and now I also have a profession. All of this I earned with my own bare hands, what kindness have my parents shown me? Just because my dad is too pitiful, I want to do my duty to him, who knew that in the end my dad still hasn't benefited from my good intentions, but has been taken advantage of by my cruel mother, then isn't my money being spent too unjustly? What's the point of sending it anymore? However, when I think carefully, if I don't send money, my mother will definitely treat my dad even worse, then my dad will suffer even more. It's always for my dad's sake that I still send the money to my mother every month..."</p>
<p>When I lived at my mother-in-law's house, I didn't know about these situations yet. At that time, I only knew that Guiying's mom was an old annoyance, and that she and her husband were very miserable. Guiying's dad sold kudzu starch jelly under the city gate, and you could see him from the hotel entrance. He was a bald and short old man. I had also seen him come to the hotel to buy wine a few times. When he saw me, he always smiled and nodded, without saying a word, took the wine, silently paid the money, and left. I had to eat some snacks every afternoon, and although the street was deserted, there were often people selling noodles and kudzu starch jelly passing by. Once, I was waiting at the hotel entrance when Guiying's dad suddenly brought a large bowl of kudzu starch jelly and asked me to eat it. Kudzu starch jelly was something I originally liked, but I didn't dare to accept what he sold. Because when I saw his kudzu starch jelly, I would associate it with the appearance of Guiying's mom and the appearance of their small, dark house. This association made me want to vomit even when looking at the bowl of kudzu starch jelly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that time A Ren helped me out and finished that big bowl. But from then on, I only ate noodles, and didn't buy kudzu starch jelly from others. If I bought kudzu starch jelly from others, Guiying's dad would definitely still see it, which would be too embarrassing.</p>
<p>I heard my wife and them say that Guiying's dad had a son who had been a standing committee member of the county party department during the revolutionary era, and was later shot. Since then, Guiying's dad's nerves had been a little strange. Sometimes he would remain silent, finish his business, and sit in the corner of his house, crying, and sometimes he would erupt, and then speak nonsense, wave his hands and feet, and make a big scene on the street.</p>
<p>My knowledge of Guiying's dad's situation was only this. But in the first half month, I had not seen him "erupt" once, probably that time was the silent period.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Special Issue</p>
<h3>Voices of the Telecommunications World: Japan Expert vs. Italy Expert</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Japanese people who are familiar with our country's situation and can speak our language are often called "China experts." Thus, our country imitated it, and the term "Japan expert" was born. "Expert" is not a bad name. As far as individuals are concerned, it is only necessary to adhere to being fair and selfless. As far as undertakings are concerned, it belongs to communication. Whether it is related to international or domestic affairs, the word "expert" has greater significance. However, today, "expert" is also difficult to define. There are those who are experts through party affiliation, and there are those who should not be experts but cannot be experts. Weighing carefully, the authorities should pay attention to these three points.</p>
<p>Japan forcibly seized the Northeast, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo. The whole country is indignant and grieved. However, according to the facts, the international relations between China and Japan still exist; the international trade between China and Japan also continues unabated. Even though there are occasional trade deficits, our country's export volume also reaches six to seven million yuan per month. Communication is naturally busy due to trade needs. In addition, regarding diplomatic and private telegrams, according to historical statistics, there has also been an increase. In the past, the telegraph business was conducted through submarine cables, and the rights were not independent, and the profits mostly flowed overseas. Since our country's international radio station has been actively expanding, and in accordance with the prescribed steps, it has already communicated with various European and American countries one after another, only with Japan has it not been realized, which is somewhat ill-considered. Moreover, China and Japan have established a government-run Shanghai-Nagasaki submarine cable for communication, with a solid foundation. Even if this radio circuit is not completed, Japan will not be severely damaged, but we will suffer losses. Now that we have signed a contract, and the rights are in our own hands, then telegrams sent to Japan by our government and merchants can all be transmitted through our own international telegraph network. Developing international communication under independent sovereignty and increasing the national treasury revenue, then the wireless radio "Japan expert" has its own necessity to be an "expert", and it is not being an expert through party affiliation.</p>
<p>As of now, the international radio station is connected to twelve places worldwide. The United States, Germany, France, and Russia were connected previously, and the British and Japanese circuits were connected later. It is now being tested with Italy, and formal opening is expected soon. One connection and everything is connected, for all countries, and also for Japan. Therefore, from the perspective of the principles and position of international communication, the recent radio Japan expert is no different from the US, France, Germany, and Russia experts before this year, the British expert in February of this year, and the Italy expert that will be connected soon. It cannot be discussed together with the issues of opening traffic and mail with the puppet state of Manchukuo that have attracted social attention.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Business Inspectors and the Public</h3>
<p>— Kai</p>
<p>Our country's telegraph business has been established for more than fifty years, but compared with various European and American countries and neighboring Japan, the degree of its widespread development is still far behind! The reasons why it is not developed and not widespread are of course very complicated; such as the national level of knowledge is too low, the habit of sending telegrams has not been cultivated, the price of telegrams is too high, exceeding the economic capacity of the general public, coupled with frequent civil wars, commercial depression, official telegrams are rampant, clogging the lines, etc., are major reasons why telegrams cannot be developed, and the deep-rooted corruption and bureaucratic habits of the telegraph business itself have also been an obstacle to the evolution of telegrams. The authorities are aware of this, and deeply know that if we want to develop and popularize the telegraph business, we must first reform the telegraph business itself, we must thoroughly eradicate all the corrupt and official habits in the telecommunications world, and actively revitalize it. Therefore, recent measures and reforms are proceeding step by step towards commercialization and popularization. The authorities also believe that if we only seek internal rectification and reform, and do not maintain frequent contact and communication with the public, and the public still maintains the same indifferent attitude towards the telegraph business as before, then there will still be many barriers and resistance to the future development of the telegraph business. Therefore, in various busy bureaus and stations, the position of telegraph business inspector has been created. They go out to inquire, promote, and explain every day, to make practical connections with the public, as a model for improving business. Therefore, the establishment of telegraph business inspectors by telegraph bureaus and stations, from the perspective of facilitating the public and developing business, does have profound significance and important mission. Since telegraph business inspectors are set up to facilitate the public and promote business, their duties are also based on this principle, and have detailed regulations:</p>
<p>(1) If senders and receivers do not understand the various provincial fee methods or regulations and procedures for sending telegrams, they should be answered in detail one by one.</p>
<p>(2) If senders and receivers have any delays or errors in incoming and outgoing telegrams, they should be assisted in checking and investigating, so that senders and receivers can get a satisfactory reply.</p>
<p>(3) If senders and receivers have any dissatisfaction with the telegraph bureau: such as incoming reports not being translated, the transcription is not clear, fees are charged in violation of regulations, telegram deliverers demand gratuities, etc., they can be fully revealed, and the inspectors should report them to the bureau and station in a timely manner, so that they can be improved or banned.</p>
<p>(4) If senders and receivers have any opinions on what the bureau and station should improve or reform, they can make suggestions to them, and the inspectors should sincerely accept them, convey them to the authorities, and consider adopting and implementing them.</p>
<p>(5) If senders and receivers need various telegram regulations, telegram price lists, and delivery slips, they should be provided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(6) If senders and receivers do not understand Cyva (namely the International Radio Station), the station's founding process, content, and handling of matters should be explained in detail, so that they can understand the truth about the International Radio Station.</p>
<p>In short, the various barriers between the public and the telegram bureau and station in the past should be clarified and understood through the inspector's visits and explanations, and the various shortcomings of the telegraph bureau and station in the past should be thoroughly investigated by the inspector, so that they can be improved day by day. Therefore, those who are telegraph business inspectors should thoroughly understand the nature of their own duties and the importance of the mission they bear, work hard and diligently, and do their best in their duties. Whether when inquiring and promoting to businesses, organizations, groups, and individuals, the attitude must be humble and gentle, the words must be sincere, the answers must be detailed and clear, the suggestions must be sincerely accepted, and every effort must be made to ensure that the people sending and receiving telegrams get a good image invisibly. On the side of the public sending and receiving telegrams, they should also deeply understand that the telegraph business inspectors are beneficial to the public and not harmful at all. Whenever they come to inquire, they should provide them with various conveniences, so that they can fulfill their mission. In this way, the telegraph business can only achieve the true goals of commercialization and popularization with the help of the public.</p>
<h3>Research on Shortwave Radio Applications (3)</h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>In shortwave radio telephone communication, sometimes the power is found to decrease due to excessively long communication distances. This is because the transmitting power on the line should be increased, especially when the transmitter is used for long distances. If the transmitting power is maintained at the original level, the transmission efficiency will inevitably be weakened. In ordinary very long-wave radio telephones, only about 10% to 15% of the actual power on the antenna is radiated. However, for shorter waves of 15 meters, the power radiated by the antenna often reaches 70%. From this perspective, for example, if the power of a long-wave transmitter is 300 kilowatts (kW), the power supplied to the antenna will be 150 kilowatts, but the actual radiated power is only 17 kilowatts. In the case of shortwaves, if the power is 30 kilowatts and the antenna requires 10 kilowatts, the radiated power can still reach 7 kilowatts. If the antenna of this shortwave machine is directional, all the radiated waves are concentrated in one direction, and the magnitude of its power is self-evident.</p>
<p>The use of shortwaves in radio can greatly increase the number of communication circuits. This is one of the reasons why shortwaves can be widely and practically used. Consider the following example: Suppose a relatively long wave has a frequency band of 50 to 100 kilocycles per second. Even if the width of each frequency band is reduced to 2,200 cycles (which is the minimum limit in commercial radio), and all the frequency transmission power is squeezed together, leaving almost no space between the frequency bands, the number of effective communication circuits obtained still cannot exceed 25. If shortwaves are used, according to modern experimental results, within the frequency range of 6,000 to 12,000 kilocycles per second, using 200 circuits of radio telephone, the spacing between each transmitting frequency band can still be 30 kilocycles per second. If this spacing is reduced to 10 kilocycles per second, the available radio telephone circuits can be increased threefold, for a total of 600 circuits. This is factually possible and is a point of progress in shortwaves.</p>
<p>In trivial detail, I have compiled this short article. The advantages and disadvantages of shortwave radio communication seem to have been discussed in detail. Originally, radio wave transmission is ever-changing. Shortwaves have not yet reached perfection. Improving them to be entirely beneficial and without any disadvantages is not something that can be achieved overnight. However, with the omnipotence of modern science, future progress can be expected day by day.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Lines</h3>
<p>— Jiran</p>
<p>Telecommunications—excluding radio telegraphs and telephones—rely on lines and machinery to form electrical connections and realize the transmission of telecommunications, whether telegraph or telephone. Machinery belongs to the internal workings. How are they constructed? How are they managed? How do they operate? It is not easy for the general public to understand the gist without visiting the equipment within the bureau. As for the lines, they pass through city streets, rural fields, and along motorways and railways. The stately erected, winding lines are visible everywhere. We are accustomed to them and do not find them odd, considering these utility poles and wires to be merely communication tools. However, if we think about it carefully, on this single thin wire, various symbolic currents flow intermittently every second, or various talking currents flicker and fluctuate, constantly flowing and going back and forth. If radio waves could be made visible, one would see currents of different lengths, carrying the mission of communication, alternating and direct, flowing on these tiny wires. The speed is beyond description. In short, compared with the transmission of various kinds of energy, the speed of "electricity" is only second to "light".</p>
<p>Telecommunications lines can be roughly divided into overhead lines, underground lines, and submarine lines. Underground and submarine lines use cables, while overhead lines use bare wires as well as cables. In general, lines that are supported and raised in the air are called overhead. The lines erected can also be called open wires (i.e., bare wires), because they are clear and easily visible, and are clearly distinguished from the wires in cables that are covered with an outer layer.</p>
<p>Building telecommunications lines (including telegraphs and telephones) on land using cables is quite common in the United States. For example, when two cities are not far apart, long-distance telephone lines are often laid using cables instead of open wires. If the line is over a thousand miles long, unless the number of required wires exceeds what one pole can bear, open wires are generally used for communication. The reason is that cables are more expensive and labor costs are much higher. From an economic perspective, open wires are certainly more advantageous. Although China's telecommunications industry has a history of more than fifty years, except for submarine cables used in some areas along the coast and the Yangtze River, and overhead or underground cables used for urban telephones, most long-distance land communications use overhead open wires.</p>
<p>When lines pass through rivers, lakes, and seas, where there is no possibility of detouring, it is undoubtedly necessary to use submarine cables. However, for long-distance communications across the mainland, unless required by the business, open wires are mostly preferred. The United States is the most developed country in telephone communications. Therefore, underground cables are used to connect New York to Philadelphia, Washington, and other important cities across the western continent. This is because the need for telephone lines has surged, and the number of circuits is beyond what poles can bear, as mentioned above. In practical terms, burying cables deep underground can avoid the impact of wind and snow disasters, and save on routine maintenance costs. However, once a problem occurs, excavation and repair are time-consuming and costly, unlike open wires, which can be quickly repaired by patrolling along the route as soon as a problem is discovered.</p>
<p>The above has roughly explained the composition of lines, but there is still something more to be said. In Europe and the United States, there is a growing trend to abandon open wires in favor of cables, especially in cities. Within cities, lines crisscross, with electric lights, trams, and so on scattered everywhere, which is detrimental to the appearance of the city and often dangerous. The only solutions are to bury the lines deep underground (i.e., underground cables) or to suspend them in cable form (i.e., overhead cables). Moreover, the development of long-distance telephones is progressing rapidly. Due to the increase in telephone circuits, there is a general sense of the need for cables, and manufacturing companies are further exploring and researching to perfect them. In recent years, experts have made inventions such as amplification equipment to amplify the sound of telephones, and radio wave transmission to increase transmission efficiency. The use of cables has become widespread, and the adoption of trunk lines has become more frequent. In countries with developed telecommunications, open wires are considered outdated. However, considering the current state of development in China, the use of cables is not yet essential. This is due to the different circumstances and should not be generalized.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Public Cooperation and the Telephone Industry</h3>
<p>— Wang Qikun</p>
<p>The nature of the telephone industry is that of a transportation enterprise for the nation, and a public utility for the locality. The completion of its mission and the development of its business depend on the efforts of the operating organization, but also require public cooperation and maintenance to fully achieve its goals. The term "public" includes all telephone users, including military and government agencies. Taking the capital as an example, the relationship between the telephone industry and the public is described below.</p>
<p>(1) Finance</p>
<p>Since the telephone business is state-owned, its funding should be raised by the state. However, when the state is facing financial difficulties, if the public needs telephones, they should share the burden and provide financial assistance so that the industry can be expanded as soon as possible. In this way, the public can also benefit earlier, with considerable gains. In Japan, during the Great Earthquake of 1923, almost all telephones in Tokyo and Yokohama were destroyed. Due to financial constraints, only the telephones of old subscribers could be restored on schedule, with no resources left for expansion. However, the number of requests for telephone installation increased annually, making it difficult to reject them all. Therefore, an alternative solution had to be found, with new subscribers bearing the construction costs. Later, a bill was enacted by the Diet, recognizing telephones as the assets of the subscribers, which could be bought and sold at will. However, new subscribers had to pay an engineering fee of 1,500 Japanese yen for each telephone installed. Furthermore, because the restoration and expansion projects of the telephone bureau were numerous and large-scale, it was difficult to install all new subscribers at the same time. Each year, only a portion could be accommodated, with public lotteries held regularly. Only those who won the lottery could pay the fee and have their phones installed, thus eliminating the need to find ways to purchase a line. Qingdao, China, also imitated this method, with the engineering fee set at 235 yuan, resulting in higher revenue for the telephone bureau and easier expansion. In the capital, the telephone bureau has three branches in addition to Pukou, with a capacity of 3,000 numbers at the main branch. All numbers were already filled, making it impossible to add more. Therefore, it was decided to establish a new South Branch, initially installing equipment for 2,000 numbers, and a suitable site has been purchased. However, due to financial constraints, the expansion has had to be delayed slightly, a difficult situation that seems to be understood by the public.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's consider Japan again. While the government is working hard to expand telephone services, its financial resources are ultimately limited. The telephone budget must be approved by the Diet, allowing for the establishment of new bureaus in only a limited number of locations each year. The public's need for telephones is urgent, making it difficult to ignore. Therefore, a special telephone installation method was established. If the public in a certain area wishes to establish a special telephone bureau ahead of the national budget, they can jointly submit a petition, and the government will plan everything. All required labor and material costs are borne by the petitioners and contributed to the state, with no compensation before or after. However, long-distance telephone connections from that area to the rest of the country will be built by the state (which, of course, must be included in the budget beforehand). In contrast, in China, due to financial constraints, the Ministry of Communications cannot actively expand long-distance telephone services within cities. Provinces are therefore establishing their own services. Thus, the same telephone business is contributed to the state in Japan without compensation, while in China, there are those belonging to the local government and those belonging to the central government, with different prices and systems. The Japanese criticize China for being disorganized, and while there may be an intention to defame, we should reflect on ourselves. Furthermore, subscribers have the right to use the telephone, which implies the obligation to pay fees. In Western countries, subscribers pay the rental fees in advance, recognizing that obligations should precede rights, and that telephone rental fees are no different from taxes if the telephone service is operated by the state. In China, only subscribers in Qingdao pay the rental fee three months in advance at the telephone bureau at the beginning of each quarter. In other regions, the bureau sends staff to collect the fees, which often results in arrears. While this may be due to the lack of effort or misconduct of the collectors, if subscribers could embrace a spirit of cooperation and voluntarily pay the fees at the bureau, not only could the number of collectors be reduced, but also the potential for corruption could be prevented. Since postage and telegram fees must be paid at the bureau, telephone fees could also be paid in this way.</p>
<p>(2) Usage</p>
<p>Whether telephone subscribers use the service appropriately has a significant impact on the satisfaction of the telephone industry's services. No matter how comprehensive the equipment of the telephone bureau is, it has certain limitations, especially in the case of automatic systems. If subscribers use the service without restraint, the supply will not be able to meet the demand, and both the telephone bureau and the subscribers will suffer. The points that subscribers should pay attention to when using the telephone are described below:</p>
<p>1.  The subscriber's number is listed in the directory. Starting this year, the Ministry of Communications has ordered all telephone bureaus to print correction slips for subscribers who have installed, removed, moved, or changed their names, once a month, to facilitate verification. However, the numbers of newly installed subscribers may not be included, so the telephone bureau has an information desk to assist subscribers with inquiries. In the capital, it is customary for the public not to check the directory before making a call, but instead to ask the information desk to check the number. This has led to an unexpected increase in unnecessary calls, occupying the lines and hindering legitimate calls. If subscribers could consider the overall situation and take the trouble to consult the directory, it would only require a small effort.</p>
<p>2.  When subscribers move, they often allow others to use their telephone without transferring the account. The new users, in turn, often try to save trouble and money by not reporting the transfer for a long time, so the directory still lists the old subscriber's name. If someone wants to reach the new user, they cannot find the number in the directory, and the information desk cannot provide the correct information. The caller may mistakenly think that the information desk is not providing good service, which affects its reputation, and the caller's business with the subscriber is also delayed, harming both parties.</p>
<p>3.  The telephone bureau has limited equipment, so not all subscribers can talk at the same time, at most only 20-30%. If subscribers engage in lengthy and irrelevant conversations, they not only occupy the lines for a long time and hinder others' legitimate calls, but also prevent important calls from being received from other locations, harming both themselves and others. During peak telephone hours (e.g., 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM), it is especially important to avoid unnecessary calls.</p>
<p>(3) Lines</p>
<p>Telephone lines are located along the roadside. Due to financial constraints, it is impossible to assign people to patrol and guard them, so it relies on the military police and the public to maintain them. If there is any theft or damage, the telephone bureau should be notified promptly so that repairs can be made quickly to facilitate communication. As for telephone poles and wires set up on private land, this is a last resort. If local residents consider it to be a hindrance, they can request that it be moved, or demand compensation. Article 18 of the Telecommunications Conditions promulgated by the National Government on August 5, 1929, stipulates: "State-owned telecommunications organizations may choose convenient locations for the construction of lines, regardless of where they pass. However, if it obstructs the rights of private individuals, the injured party may request compensation after the Ministry of Communications of the Executive Yuan of the National Government or its entrusted agency has verified the facts." Long-distance telephone and telegraph poles, with the exception of a very small number, are all planted on private land, which inevitably obstructs crops. However, the public understands the importance of the telecommunications business and embraces a spirit of sacrificing private interests for the public good, and has never requested this compensation. In Japan, it is stipulated that a rental fee of one cent per year should be paid for each telephone pole planted on private land, but no one has ever asked the government for this rental fee. Recently, the Capital Telephone Bureau received a bizarre warning letter, stating that today, the bureau installed a telephone for Mr. Zhang ××'s residence, and the wires passed through Mr. Wei ××'s land and occupied more than three zhang of airspace. Although the writer is from Sheng County, Zhejiang, and is unfamiliar with Nanjing, he is still a member of the Republic of China. He warned the bureau about this organized infringement on his property and demanded a response within three days, otherwise he would seek judicial and administrative solutions. This gentleman equated the lines of the state-owned telecommunications organization with the Japanese military aircraft that illegally flew through North China's airspace, a distortion that does not need to be refuted. It is regrettable that the bourgeoisie of the capital cannot recognize the nature of telephone lines and are unwilling to cooperate and maintain them. It is reminiscent of the burning of telephone poles by the public in Hunan and other provinces due to feng shui concerns when telegraphs were first introduced to China five thousand years ago. Furthermore, the majority of long-distance telephone and telegraph lines pass through the outskirts of cities, and even in remote rural areas. The surveying markers and the poles and wires after construction are almost all located on private land. If the cooperation of the landowners cannot be obtained, there is a risk of being attacked and it will be impossible to fulfill their mission.</p>
<p>Based on the three points mentioned above, the importance of public cooperation to the telephone business is clear. Since the development of telephones is related to the public interest, the public will surely cooperate. The more developed the telephone, the more public cooperation is needed, and the more the public cooperates, the more the telephone can develop. These two things are mutually causative and mutually beneficial. If we seek the development of the telephone business, this is what we hope for from the public, and it is imperative.</p>
<h3>Talking About Wooden Poles for Telecommunications (1)</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>There are several types of telephone poles: wooden poles, iron poles, and concrete poles. Among them, wooden poles are the cheapest and most widely used, so I will start by describing wooden poles.</p>
<p>The materials used for wooden poles on telegraph and telephone lines also vary. In the United States, fir, chestnut, and red pine are used. In general, the United States has rich forests, and materials are sourced locally to save on transportation costs. Therefore, red pine is mostly used for lines west of the Rocky Mountains, while fir and chestnut are more abundant in the eastern states and the Midwest, and the above two types are used for pole harvesting. Relatively speaking, fir is preferred by most countries for pole materials because it grows slowly and the trunks are straight, making it suitable for the installation of electrical lines. Chestnut wood is often curved, making it less aesthetically pleasing than fir in urban areas. However, it has one advantage: fir is prone to cracking when dry, while chestnut wood is not. Ordinary electric poles erected in densely populated areas are often exposed to smoke and become brittle, but chestnut wood can withstand it without harm. Also, when pole wood catches fire, chestnut wood has strong resistance due to its firm inner quality, and it is slower and more resistant to burning than other types of wood. This is certainly an advantage. In European countries, where timber production is not high, some is imported from the Americas in addition to self-sufficiency. The wooden poles used that are produced in this continent are only from Scandinavia, Finland, and part of Soviet Russia. They are mostly red pine; however, Siberia has extremely rich forests, and many are suitable for telephone poles. Over the years, large quantities have been sold to Northeast China and within the customs, which is what is known as Huanghua pine. In China, timber is mostly planted in the inland provinces of Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces, and large quantities of timber are sold to other places every year. In particular, Hankou is the national center, where timber merchants gather. Most of the wooden poles used for telecommunications are sourced from Hankou, and are rarely purchased from overseas unless absolutely necessary. China's telecommunications materials, from machinery to electrical wires and parts, are mostly supplied by other countries. Due to the decline of industry and the lack of manufacturing capacity, the leakage is very large, and there is still no way to reverse it. Only this wooden pole, compared with imported goods, is not inferior, and is used by the general telecommunications workers, like the only remaining fruit. Touching upon this, I cannot help but sigh. However, from the perspective of telecommunications alone, the number of wooden poles required each year is already huge. According to US statistics, there are more than 35 million telephone poles nationwide. Assuming that the average lifespan of a wooden pole is ten years, then one-tenth must be replaced each year, which requires 3.5 million wooden poles. According to a survey of China's telecommunications in 1931, as of the end of 1930, there were 175,873 li of lines, and the number of poles was 1,187,934. If we use the United States as a ratio, we would need to replace more than 118,000 poles annually. If China's afforestation efforts are not improved, then the poles needed for telecommunications will be cut down day by day, and it may be difficult to sustain. What's more, the suppliers who rely on timber are countless. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated afforestation for more than one reason, even if we think of it from the telecommunications use, it should arouse the attention of society.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications World</h3>
<p>— Zhenfang</p>
<p>New Construction of Telecommunications in Soviet Russia</p>
<p>February 25th marked the 13th anniversary of the establishment of the Georgian Soviet system. The wireless telephone between Tiflis and Moscow (3,218 kilometers) has been completed and officially opened for business. Before this month, shortwave photo wireless telephone between Moscow and Tashkent (3,328 kilometers) began to work. This is the first long-distance communication established in the Soviet Union and one of the longest circuits in the world. This year, the telegraph and telephone line between Moscow and Boli is under construction, with a length of 9,000 kilometers, exceeding the distance from New York to San Francisco. The new line will pass through Samarra, Boli, Irkutsk, Chita, and other places. The electrical connection line from Boli to Vladivostok, Amur Province, and Yakutsk Province is also planned. In order to increase the volume, it is planned to build 30 special amplification stations.</p>
<p>Opening of Osaka Wharf Telephone</p>
<p>The wharf telephone service of Osaka Port connecting ship shore was established on February 15. Because the distance between the wharf and the commercial center is quite far, the installation of telephones is very needed. The telephone bill is 5 yen per day, but there is no additional fee for calls within the city. The long-distance telephone fee is charged at the normal price. When Osaka ships are docked, there is no wireless telephone installed between the ship and the shore like Kobe. That business,</p>
<p>Promotion of French Fax Telegraph</p>
<p>According to a notice from the British Post Office: the fax telegraph business between Britain and France has now been extended to the cities and towns in the provinces of Bordeaux, Lyon, Mabaud, Nice, and Pistertrasbourg. After that, the transmission of pictures from France to England only needs to be transferred through the Paris Central Telegraph Office.</p>
<p>Closure of Famous British Radio Station</p>
<p>The Poldhu radio station in Cornwall, England, is scheduled to close at the end of this month. The release of this notice aroused a group of attention. The station was the station where Marconi received the first transatlantic Morse signal in Newfoundland, and it was also the station where the first wireless telephone was transmitted from England to the United States. Now, due to centralized research, there is no need to use this old-fashioned radio station.</p>
<p>Amendment to Telegraph Prices by US Commercial Telegraph Companies</p>
<p>US commercial telegraph companies have successively announced that, starting this year, they will implement various international telegraph prices revised by the Madrid International Telegraph Conference. The original ten-character codewords have been changed to five-character codewords - charged at 60% of the ordinary telegraph price. The express telegraph price was charged at three times the ordinary telegraph price, but now it has been changed to two times the ordinary telegraph price. In addition, priority telegrams traveling to and from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean are charged at 25% of the ordinary telegraph price, but now all are charged at the express telegram price. The priority telegram price was only applicable to telegrams between the United States and European countries, and those traveling to and from other countries were called express telegrams. The revised price cancels the priority telegram method. According to general observations, international remittances and stock trading between the United States and London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, etc. will be greatly affected, because the original US priority telegrams were mostly issued by exchanges and banks.</p>
<h3>Bi-Monthly News</h3>
<p>— Club Member</p>
<p>Revised Method for Radio Material Import Passport</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the original "Method for Temporary Import Passports for Radio Materials" is not perfect, and has now been revised to "Method for Applying for Import Passports for Radio Materials," which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the Fumu government. The differences between this method and the old temporary method are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  For imported materials that belong to radio receiving products, a long application form should be filled out and submitted to the ministry, along with the shipping invoice and three copies of it.</p>
<p>2.  For imported materials that belong to transmitting products, in addition to the previous article, the purpose should be described in detail. If the order is placed on behalf of someone else, a certificate of purpose from the person ordering the food should be attached.</p>
<p>3.  When transmitting products are sold, the selling merchant should obtain a statement from the buyer and submit it to the Ministry for verification and issuance of a permit before selling.</p>
<p>4.  Passport fee is calculated according to the value of the material, excluding the fee.</p>
<p>Detailed methods can be requested from our company by letter.</p>
<p>Public Telephones will be installed in Post and Telecommunications Bureaus</p>
<p>In order to facilitate public telephone calls, the Ministry of Communications has recently formulated a method for setting up public telephones in telecommunications bureaus and post offices, ordering the post and telecommunications bureaus in large commercial ports that have municipal or remote telephone services run by the Ministry to install public telephones so that they can retail municipal or long-distance telephone calls. This method can be realized in the near future, and the public can make calls anytime, anywhere, which will be extremely convenient.</p>

<h3>A True Man Does Not Eat Food of a False Nation</h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that Deng Tiemei, the Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoning Self-Defense Army, after being captured, was escorted by over a thousand Japanese soldiers to the Shenyang Army Prison for detention. A small Japanese squad guarded him. Officials of the puppet government and Japanese individuals who admired Deng's reputation flocked to visit him. Deng only spoke with one or two individuals who possessed some integrity and remained silent otherwise. He has not eaten for several days since entering the prison. The Japanese sent several tables of banquets, but he refused to eat, saying, "A true man does not eat food of a false nation." He directly rebuked the puppet officials for their shameless treachery, causing those who heard him to feel ashamed and avert their faces. This is truly a precious and moving piece of news that should fill us with awe and make us feel increasingly ashamed.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Chinese people has long been declining. Since September 18th, Japan has used artillery fire to force the entire country to submit. At that time, there were indeed some impassioned students and small citizens who made some displays of defiance, but these were soon completely extinguished. As for now, the term "anti-Japanese" is almost never heard, and everyone seems to be quietly living under oppression. Debauchery and pleasure fill every city. Many people observe that with the spirit of the Chinese people so diminished, China is completely without hope. In reality, this is completely wrong. How could the spirit of the Chinese people have declined? Not only has it not declined, but it is secretly, at the core of society, growing and developing day by day. Responding to the impetus of objective external facts, it is becoming increasingly urgent and progressive. Deng Tiemei's impassioned vow not to eat the food of a false nation, although it is his personal action, immediately reveals to me countless tens of thousands of anti-Japanese people in the entire Northeast behind him.</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese actions of the entire Northeast anti-Japanese populace did not begin today. Since September 18th, they have started an unprecedented bloody struggle, following the oppression of imperialist guns. This struggle has reached an even more intense and acute stage today. We should not think that just because we haven't seen news about the Northeast Volunteer Armies for a long time, the anti-Japanese forces of the Northeast populace have been extinguished. This is wrong.</p>
<p>Do not be pessimistic, the anti-resistance forces of China will not be destroyed, and will never be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Cousin</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>After a separation of ten years, my cousin suddenly returned home, appearing much older. The image of my cousin from ten years ago is completely different from the way she looks now. I couldn't help but sigh secretly: youth is fleeting, my cousin has truly aged!</p>
<p>I remember when she was young, she often came to stay at my house. At that time, she was a girl of seventeen or eighteen, while I was only about ten years old. She was very beautiful, as beautiful as a cherished lily about to bloom. Among the many female relatives, almost no one could compare to her. From a young age, people called her "Beauty." Even now, I still call her "Sister Beauty." She was very loving and caring towards me, always touching my hair and taking me out to play. I also felt very gentle and affectionate towards her. Because she was so beautiful and had no siblings, my parents cherished her very much, regarding her as the apple of their eye. In particular, regarding the matter of marriage, they were not easily accommodating. On the one hand, they hoped to choose a suitable match for their daughter, and on the other hand, they were reluctant to let her leave their side. Therefore, whenever this matter was mentioned, they would say to choose slowly, to choose slowly, delaying it.</p>
<p>Later, I left home to wander outside and never went back, but soon I finally heard the news of my cousin's marriage.</p>
<p>This time when I returned home, my cousin happened to be there too, giving us the chance to meet. However, my cousin was no longer the cousin of the past. She had become the mother of a four-month-old child. Her face was vaguely marked with many wrinkles, and her eyebrows knitted together when she smiled. The color of youth had completely faded, leaving not a trace, and the vitality of her youth was forever separated from her. The accumulation of time and the tribulations of life had caused her to lose everything, causing her to quickly wither. A sense of life's melancholy and sorrow was strongly expressed in her actions and speech. The fragrant and youthful period of a young woman had passed like a dream.</p>
<p>What a middle-aged mother-like cousin!</p>
<p>The burden of managing her son and all the trivial family matters was heavily pressed on her shoulders, making her senses strangely dull. She had become like a machine, working tirelessly from morning to night, without a moment to rest. Her four or five children were always making trouble, either arguing about food or drink, or one crying and the other screaming, pacifying the older ones, while the younger ones cling to her, keeping her hands and feet constantly busy.</p>
<p>Every day was so exhausting that her bones felt numb. At night, the fatigue of the whole day made her feel unbearably sleepy. She would hastily lie on the bed, preparing to sleep comfortably. But then the children would start clamoring again: wanting water, wanting candy. If she pretended not to care, the children would hit their mother's body, insisting on waking her up.</p>
<p>In this situation, my cousin had no choice but to temporarily stay with relatives for a few days to seek peace and quiet, and my house was where she liked to come, freeing her from the chores of her own home for a while. But the children's entanglements came along with her.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>In the morning, I saw my cousin baring her chest, breastfeeding an infant less than a year old. She was also putting on makeup in front of the mirror. The infant was probably uncomfortable lying on her bent knees, and although she was drinking, she was still acting strangely, struggling desperately. The mother had no choice but to put down her hand, pick her up and shake her a few times, and then stuff another nipple into her mouth. The child still cried hoarsely. So my cousin became annoyed, slapped the child's bottom forcefully, and cursed:</p>
<p>"You little bastard, cry yourself to death, die early and be done with it!"</p>
<p>"Cousin, the child doesn't understand anything. Hitting her won't help. Just coax her gently." I said softly from the side.</p>
<p>"You don't understand. These short-lived things seem like enemies from a previous life, deliberately coming to collect debts. I'm really fed up."</p>
<p>In this way, I discovered that my cousin's temperament had changed greatly. Usually, whenever she was in a bad mood, and the child happened to be bothering her, she would grab her and slap her a few times, seemingly using this to vent her anger. Mothers often like to do this, unable to bear the anger from their husbands or mothers-in-law, and having no way to vent it, so they take it out on their children. My cousin had also developed this kind of temper!</p>
<h3>Thorns</h3>
<p>— Yan Wei</p>
<p>Every step is a thorn, and this is another experience.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sky was so gloomy, it was the season of plum rains, and it looked like it was going to rain. My wife and I didn't bring rain gear, and we were afraid of getting our new clothes wet, so we chose two casual outfits and took the train from our hometown, Cixi, to Shanghai.</p>
<p>We, who are used to a pampered life in the city, could not withstand a month of roaming under the sun, and our skin had turned much darker. Because we ran in the mountains every day, we didn't have time to get haircuts, so our hair had grown quite a bit. Reluctantly, we bid farewell to the mountains and rivers of our hometown. The train took us past village after village, and as we listlessly watched the scenery shift, we couldn't help but feel a special emotion.</p>
<p>The train stopped at XX Station. In the crowded crowd, we were挤 squeezed out of the station. Just as we were about to call for a car, soldiers in military uniforms stopped us. The soldiers wore multi-pointed badges on their arms, and alarmingly, they carried wooden guns with exposed blades on their shoulders. Their chests were covered in various miscellaneous items, in short, frightening weapons that could destroy us.</p>
<p>The soldier said, "Open them!" and pointed with his hand.</p>
<p>Under the soldier's command, I began to realize how small my life was, and only then did I realize that the warrior wanted to see the suitcase in my hand. I solemnly placed the suitcase I was carrying on the ground. Just then, the warrior ordered again:</p>
<p>"Hurry up!"</p>
<p>Panicked, I was so eager that I couldn't even open the lock. After a commotion, I finally managed to open it, but the soldier's expression was no longer pleasant. He perfunctorily flipped through the clothes, and didn't care about the documents or newspapers. Instead, he repeatedly examined the packages of food that our relatives had sent us. To put it in merchant terms, it was like a Jiangxi jeweler looking at antiques. What he considered most suspicious was a bag of peeled longan meat.</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>"Longan meat!"</p>
<p>He seemed not to believe it, took out a few pieces, and ordered me to taste a few. Seeing that I didn't suffer any pain, he thought it was safe to try, and chewed some too. But once he tasted the flavor, it was all over. He grabbed a large handful and stuffed it into his mouth. My business was finished. I looked for my wife. My wife also had a suitcase ready to be opened.</p>
<p>But women's things are naturally more miscellaneous. He found a treasure trove, looked at this item, and then that item. I started to get a little angry. So I mustered up my courage:</p>
<p>"Could you please hurry up and find out what's what!"</p>
<p>"What did you say?"</p>
<p>I saw that the situation was not right, and quickly shut up.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there was also a suspicious item in my wife's suitcase, a package of Chinese medicine called Plague Averting Pills.</p>
<p>As usual, we were interrogated. I told him what it was. He wanted to call me again, but he was a little embarrassed. I told him it was medicine, but he didn't believe me. This was difficult.</p>
<p>"Okay," this posture was different again, probably meaning to keep the case, and look for something else. He searched around like a hunting dog.</p>
<p>Ah! The warrior's behavior stopped. There was a package of letters, one of which was a letter from a friend asking an important person to forward it to us. He looked at the envelope for a while, and then pointed to the name of the important person, asking if I knew him? He probably thought that if the important person could forward the letter, this person must have some background. So he closed the suitcase, threw back the Plague Averting Pills, and said, "Finished."</p>
<p>We walked out of the station in a panic.</p>
<p>Every step is a thorn, and this is another experience.</p>
<h3>Zongzi Talk</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>The Chinese are a barbaric people and don't know what art is. However, in addition to cooking raw rice into cooked rice, they can also wrap it in bamboo leaves and fill it with lard and bean paste, red beans, and meat bones to make a multi-angled zongzi, as it is called. The zongzi from Sijing is the most famous. During the Dragon Boat Festival, major local product companies promote themselves as the Zongzi King. The most luxurious ones sell for six yuan. Country people mistakenly believe that Shanghai is paved with gold, or this is due to this kind of exaggerated rumor. But the customs of eating cherries and green plums at the Beginning of Summer, eating mooncakes at the Mid-Autumn Festival, and eating zongzi at the Dragon Boat Festival, the former can be said to be new products on the market, eat them quickly; the latter are indeed somewhat mythological and absurd. Even the dragon boat races have become good advertisements for selling more tickets. This clearly shows that the Chinese are good at exploiting the reputation of the dead. Just look at the fact that the bones of the deceased are not yet cold, and their posthumous works have already been promoted with great skill.</p>
<p>Since I arrived in Shanghai, I ordered a ban on unconscious sacrifices, so I was judged guilty of "extinguishing ancestors." Of course, leisurely pleasures like eating mooncakes and eating zongzi are not included in the account after eating enough white rice. Last year on the Dragon Boat Festival, a girlfriend personally sent several zongzi, saying that "if you don't eat zongzi on the Dragon Boat Festival, no one will send you any when you're old." She is a university student and should have read more books than me, or perhaps it is in line with scientific principles, so I devoured the zongzi at noon that day. But according to unscientific sayings: "Accumulate grain to prevent hunger, raise children to prevent old age." To think that zongzi has the same effect as children is a mystery that I have never known in my life.</p>
<h3>The Children After Their Father Died</h3>
<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>The children had some doubts about their mother's unusual behavior recently; resentment – it seemed that their mother's current treatment of them was not as gentle and considerate as before. She often showed a fierce gaze; if it were a mistake in the past, it wouldn't make her angry! She wouldn't pull down their pants and start hitting them like now. Even if she corrected the mistake or taught them a lesson, they wouldn't do it again; it's not like now, where she hits their buttocks as soon as they make a move! It seems like a very skilled technique, after several practice experiences.</p>
<p>After being beaten for no apparent reason, the children cried for a while, with no one to complain to! They watched their mother dress up gaudily, put on new clothes, and go out. Before leaving the room, she even came back in again, looked in the mirror, applied rouge again, and then leaned close to the mirror several times to look at her face. It seemed like the two patches of red were not very even. She felt disappointed!</p>
<p>From the corner of the mirror, she saw the two children stopping their tears and peeking. She couldn't help but get angry again, rushed forward, and with both hands, grabbed the two children by their long ears.</p>
<p>"Mother, we won't do it again..."</p>
<p>In fact, the children didn't quite understand the reason why their mother pulled their ears this time.</p>
<p>Seeing that their mother had truly left the door, very far away, and they couldn't see her shadow!</p>
<p>The two children sat down side by side on the wooden bench, with two streams of dried tears on their faces and dark bruises where they had rubbed them with the back of their hands. The older one reached over and touched the ear of the younger one that had been pulled.</p>
<p>"Younger brother, does it still hurt?" The younger one didn't answer, and cried out again. He leaned into the older one's arms.</p>
<p>"Older brother, I really don't believe it, she's our mom, our own mother?"</p>
<p>The older brother held the younger brother's hand, the dark back of his hand where he had rubbed his eyes. He couldn't say anything? He didn't know when, a tear rolled down onto the younger brother's hand. "Ah, older brother, you're crying! Does your ear still hurt?" The younger brother jumped up! He had completely forgotten that he still had tears on his face too.</p>
<p>"It's not that my ear hurts! I'm wondering, why is mother so bad to us after father died? Could it be that because father died, mother can hit us; otherwise, just for moving a bowl of beans, we would be beaten so badly! Younger brother, how old is older brother this year? Yesterday, Uncle Zhang told me that mother is very close to Jin A-si from the village ahead! The one with the freckled and pockmarked face who smokes; she wants us to call him uncle. I didn't want to call him that, so mother twisted my lips until they were blue. That person is so annoying! But mother is so fond of him."</p>
<p>"Older brother, let's buy a pistol and shoot him dead!"</p>
<p>But the children still didn't have that much courage!</p>
<p>After the news of their mother's remarriage to Jin A-si was announced, the two children clung to their mother's clothes and wouldn't let go, crying as if the tears were coming from a burst water faucet.</p>
<p>Uncle Zhang couldn't bear to see it and went to Jin A-si's side to plead! Allow them to bring the two children! They didn't agree! The reason was that they already had too many children, and didn't need two more burdens.</p>
<p>And their mother was also determined to abandon these two children; she sold them to Old Man Chen for thirty yuan to look after the cattle and do odd jobs.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the images of the children faded and disappeared from their mother's memory.</p>
<h3>Notes for Contributors</h3>
<p>— Wu Qi</p>
<p>Do you know the criteria for submitting articles to magazines? I know a thing or two and don't dare to keep it a secret. Now I'm making it public.</p>
<p>Because readers are worshiping idols, magazine editors are pleased to sell the heads of savages: celebrities, scholars, PhDs, important people, and well-known writers. Articles from these people are very welcome, no matter how many articles from unknown people are piled up like mountains. They ask them for articles in person and also send letters urging them to submit. Some even ask others to intercede and help get an article. In this situation, articles submitted by unknown people are either returned unopened with postage stamps attached, or thrown into the wastebasket without postage stamps, sentenced to imprisonment. If you understand this situation, if you hope that your own masterpiece will be published, you should (1) discuss it with celebrities, scholars, PhDs, important people, and well-known writers, and submit the article with their brand. This will guarantee your success. But if the manuscript fee is only one to two yuan per thousand words when you submit it yourself and it is lucky enough to be published, but now it is submitted with a brand and is published, it is five to ten yuan per thousand words. Then you should obediently let the owner of the brand distribute the manuscript fee to you. Even if it is one to two yuan per thousand words, and he earns a lot without working, you have to endure it and not say anything. This is speaking about dissertations and literary creation. If it is a translation, then you should (2) discuss it with celebrities, scholars, PhDs, important people, and well-known writers, add their brand as "co-translator", and submit the article. This will also guarantee your success. But the manuscript fee or royalties for "co-translated" articles must be split with the owner of the brand, either 50/50 or 60/40. You should endure the distribution of the "co-translator" and not make any claims. And for both of the above methods, practitioners should "keep the secret strictly." If someone exposes you and publishes the truth, and the "co-translator" and the nominal author order you to come forward and declare that what people are publishing is a rumor, you have to do it respectfully. | Don't people know the way? Let me tell you all: the first shop to start this kind of transaction was a romance novel shop, followed by a drama expert shop, an XX research expert shop, and a somewhat "pushed" essay expert shop. | However, the boss of the last shop once bought manuscripts without paying, so it is best to sign a contract with him to avoid future disputes.</p>
