<h3 id="c17">白銀出口徵稅與平衡收支　素 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>自我財部宣布白銀出口徵稅以後。國際方面對於這個政策的批判。似乎有些「大驚小怪」的模樣。什麽「加入金鎊集團。」什麽「中國人的高明在美國之上」的種種議論。都是些片面的揣度。要知道在一種新政策開始樹立的當兒。自然免不了帶着一些嘗試的性質。就是美國總統羅斯福的藍鷹運動。亦何曾諱言試諗。只要目標正大。上下能抱着一致合作的心理。那未這政策至少能發揮一部分的效能。我們現在要問。財部新政策的目標是什麽呢那是很簡單的。</p>
<p>我國是一個銀本位國家。每年須支付巨量的商品入超的。代價但國内並沒有可供支付的巨量生金銀。從地面下挖掘出來。因此目前散布在民間的以及保留於銀行的存銀。便是準備國際支付的唯一工具。萬一存銀的外流過於巨大。那末採取緊急處置的手段。便是很自然的結果。財政當局這次徵收白銀出口稅。原是針對着美國抬髙銀價的政策而採取的一種緊急的處置但其目標却只在發揮自衛的精神。而並沒有對付任何國家的意味。至於直接禁銀出口。或宣布改用金本位。儘管在表面上似乎可以收到同樣的效力但究不如徵稅仍可以保持伸縮的作用。同時。徵稅還可以避免許多權限上的困難。因爲客卿在稅權上的妨碍。究竟是有限的。</p>
<p>但是。最後我們還得追問一下。保護國内存銀的目標。單靠徵稅的方法。是否就能達到。又是否就能發揮國家經濟政策的基本意義呢。這是一個相當繁複的問題。第一這個問題的意義。可以把他當作防止私運看。雖然說徵稅愈高。私運的魔力亦愈。大但只要政府與金融業能充分合作。却亦沒有什麽困難第二從另一方面看。防止白銀外流一事。如果要做得完全美滿的結局必得從外流的原因加以根本解决。解决得適當。不但白銀不至外流或許還可以流入。這便是大量的外貨入口問題。第三徵稅的目標。固然在於自衛。惟目前貿易的入超甚巨。而白銀不能流出。外匯就要昻貴起來。豈不是要和國外的通貨膨脹運動立於針對的地位嗎。若非外貨進口日縮。我們的自衛原則。是很不易維持的。</p>
<p>照上面的說法。徵收出口稅。誠然是比較最適宜的政策。但若非有積極的輔助方法。以挽回目前國際收支的均勢。那末。這個適宜的政策。也就不易發揮效能了。目前財政當局正在進行匯兌平準委員的組織。似乎各種積極的輔助方法。已有逐漸實現之望。這自然是合於時世需要的擧動。</p>

<p>省垣方面　學校教育、頗爲發達、高等教育、計有甘肅學院一所、内分大學高中兩部、大學部又分法律·醫科·文學科·農科·專修科·四系、高中分三級、全校學生人數二百五十餘名、每月經費七、三五三·○○○元、中等教育、計有第一師範學校、分高初二級、師範科一班、初中科六班、附小八班、學生約四百餘人（附小不計）、每月經費五、○八五·六五○元、每一中學、分高初兩級、初中六班、高中二班、學生約五百餘人、每月經費四、七三九·八○○元、第一農業學校、並通科三班、學生約一百六十餘名、每月經費三、六九○·六五○元第五中學、初中五班、附小六班、學生約一百四十餘名（附小不計）、每月經費二、五一一·九七○元、第一工業學校、普通科三班、學生約一百一十餘名、每月經費三、六九○·六五○元、第一女子師範學校、高中師範科一班、初中四班、幼稚師範一班、職業科一班、附小六班、幼稚園二組、學生約一百二十餘名、（附小幼稚園不計）、每月經費三、六七○·五六○元、</p>
<p>以上中高七校、每月經費、共計三萬零七百四十二元二角八分、以一千五百二十餘學生分配、每生每月約佔經費數二十元有餘、而設備費尙不在内、此輩中高畢業生、除學雜書籍等費不計外、其歷年所佔經費總數、在一千四百餘元以上、畢業生卒業後、倘無門路以從事社會生産事業、則社會與畢業生、更將交受不良之影響、是豈教育之本意歟、</p>
<p>本省教育行政、（甲）高等教育、改國内留學學費爲獎學金、教廳昔爲培養專門人才起見、特於國内各大學及學院或專科學校、設有省費名額、嗣以省費生之能攷入國立大學者少、而攷私立大學者多、能入自然科系者少、而入社會科系者多、以致所學不能適應本省需要、教廳爲矯正此弊、特將國内留學生學費、改爲獎學金、按學生成績之優劣、酌給省費、以增進學效率、（乙）中等教育、通令各中等學校加授番文、並令第五中學添辦蒙藏特别班、教廳前奉教育部令、准中等學校外國語科目、增加蒙藏語、於是教廳除令省立第五中學、積極計畫添設蒙藏特别班外、並令飭各縣各級中學校、加授番女、藉教育爲開發西北、促進文化之途徑、（丙）初等教育、目前之重要行政工作、爲恢復各縣停頓之各級小學校、各縣因連年水旱爲災、教育經費、瀕於破産、以致各級小學校、停頓者甚多、初等教育、爲一切教育之基礎、亟應速謀恢復現教廳已令飭各縣教育局、切實遵照恢復辦法辦理矣、（丁）社會教育、設立民衆教育館曁社教推廣處、民衆教育館之設立、所需經費浩大、故教廳計劃呈請省府將甘肅省教育館、劃歸教育廳、改辦民衆教育館、此外、教廳又分設社會教育推廣處三所、内設宣傳·調查·體育·三股、月、支經費二百四十三元、現以添置書報閲覽室、月增經費五十元、（戊）教育經費、撥全甘捲菸特指爲教育補助費、省垣中上各校、每月約需經費三萬餘元、經臨時維持會議决、將甘肅推運局全部收入、　作各該校專欵、省府改組成立後、適値淡月、專欵難期收足、而各縣中等各校、除舊欠外、應領二十一年上期經費、亦多拖欠、教廳爲維持全省教育現狀計、提案省府、請准將捲菸特税局收入、一併劃作教育經費、以資恊助、並會同財政廳議定保障是項教育專欵辦法三條、經省會議决通過施行、於是歷年以積你彌補之甘省教育經費、始得有的欵維持、如於各級學校增加設置費、减縮經常費、提高教員待遇、則甘肅教育前途、大有希望也、</p>
<p>教育廳長水楚琴、自二十一年接辦以來、對於教育設施、雖曰維持現狀、但於可能範圍中、亦能盡力亟圖改進、故成績日著、聲譽頗好、據談、甘省民族複雜、人民向來不重讀書、民元以前、回番兩族同胞、更絶對不使子弟入學、近年回教領袖、已知提倡教育、而番民之知讀書者、仍屬寥寥、所謂開發西北、無論水利交通農田礦産文化方面、均非先有詳密計劃、以謀等量發展不可、以教育言、對現有普通學校、宜謀充實與改進固矣、但對於大多數之番回同胞、不另設特殊方法、使受教育、并提高等文化程度、實爲理勢所不意、幸回番領袖、亦極力贊成、或另設回番學校、或於各校附設特别班均可、惟各地連年災害、民生凋敝、無論對任何方面之開發與建設、非賴中央及東南人士之實力贊助、殊難以言效果也、</p>
<p>甘省新聞事業、在清光緒末年間、少數知識分子、始間有知閲覽報紙者、民元光復、國民黨首在蘭州、創刋大河日報、同時共和黨亦有蘭州日報之刋行、旋相繼停刋、民國五六年間、有「河聲」及「隴右公報」出版、亦僅曇花一現、民國七年、邊聲週報刋發、宗旨在融洽漢回種族意見、資金困難、逾年停刋、十四五年國民軍入甘、有新隴日報、與省黨部主辦之民國日報、新隴日報十八年停刋、民國日報持續至今、迨至二十年以來、始驟形發達、出版報紙及通訊社·有如雨後春筍、日報計有民國日報·西北日報·新隴日報·隴南民聲日報·四種、日刋計有五涼之聲·烏蘭日刋·二種、週報計有徽光週報·邊關週報·隴西民聲·河西週報·甘州民聲·民言報·河陽週報·七種、通訊計有民間通訊·民輿通訊·正聞通訊·臨夏通訊·武陽通訊·航電通訊·醒民通訊·景泰通訊·農村通訊·西和通訊·三隴通訊·邊聞通訊·十二種、此外尙有各機關學校之刋物、名目繁多、不及備載、然對社會文化、皆各有供獻焉、</p>

<h3 id="c127">加徵白銀出口税後顧馨一談雜糧市况 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>麥粉價漲交易所追繳證金</p>
<p>國産農産物暢銷農民得益</p>
<p>中央社云、自財政部宣告加徵白銀出口税後、本市各種貨物交易、市塲上之市况、均現激增之象、中央社記者、特訪本市雜糧公會主席顧馨一、叩詢雜糧市况、據談如次、</p>
<p>麥粉價漲　據顧氏首稱、本市雜糧及麵粉等市價、自入秋均現下跌、而外貨乘虚傾銷、更有一蹶不振之槪、惟自財政部因我國最近來白銀出口數之激增、於是宣佈增加白銀出口税後、在白銀本身、則可减少出口之數、而外貨因受此影響、市價見增、譬如小麥一項、原有加拿大等國來華銷售、假定原價爲二元、惟以白銀徵收出口税後、則其價格同時亦須增價、於是國内市價、因亦見髙、</p>
<p>追繳證金　邇日市塲各種物價漲風甚盛、故各交易所對於繳付證金一事、亦需增加、現經决定小麥每一千包、其應繳證金增至五百元、麵粉每五百担應繳證金增至四百元、現以追繳空頭證金、暫告停拍、一俟空頭證金、一律繳齊後、再行開拍、</p>
<p>物價看高　顧氏復謂、按目前情形、各種物價、尙有續漲之勢、而政府尙擬於出口税後征收平衡税、現在本市卽將成立平衡委員會、按照倫敦白銀市價、與本市市價折合後、其所差之數、卽加征平衡税、使本市白銀出口時與倫敦市價相等、故白銀平衡税增收後、則各種物價、勢將繼續見高</p>
<p>農民得益　顧氏末謂、此次政府毅然征收白銀出口税及平衡税、使各種貨物、均能見增、商人方面、對於政府此舉、深表同情、而農村中因各種農産物之價格亦均見增高、則外貨可抵制入口、而國産農産物得以暢銷、故於農民生活上自亦得益非淺、現以實行伊始、市塲上不免略有波動、但不久當可卽告平穩、</p>

<p>第三回　未解　零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>平地上堆着一個長方形的土臺子，那就是睡覺的坑，土壁上釘些木頭椿子、挖幾個大小窟窿，他們家的箱子櫃子，也都在那裏了。窮人眞有窮到這樣子的，我想那和死屍躺在地裏頭，没有什麽分别。你們這小西天，是闊人來往的地方。好像我們雖是不闊，呌我住窰洞了，我也是不幹的。你們爲什麽要做窰洞子呢？茶房將嘴向屋後面一努，笑道：窰洞子就在後院裏，你可以去看看。都是窰洞子，那好壞可大有分别。程志前笑道：怎樣的好法，我倒要去看看。說着，出了這個小院子，就向後面大院子走來。這裏正有拆卸的舊屋子，還留了一點軀殼，在裏面亂堆石灰，蔴繩，匠人用的傢具。空過這舊屋，兩三進新蓋的房屋，未曾完工，八百十來個瓦木匠，都停了工，在院子裏聚攏着。程志前心想，莫非有什麽問題，索興走近前來看看。等待他進了這裏院時，原來是工人門進餐呢。觀察起來，倒别有情景，他三個一堆，五個一羣，或圍了階沿石坐着，或一順邊的靠了墻坐着。他們都是滿身泥灰，談不到乾凈，所以大家都是坐在地上。在他們許多人中間，有個大籐籮，裏面裝着拳頭在的冷黑饝。籮邊有隻帶了蓋的木桶，盛了一桶水，看去縱然是熱的，也不是煮開了的水，因爲看到工人喝水，很隨便的喝下去，並不像個燙嘴的樣子呢。這裏另有幾十隻瓦質的碗，和一筐筷子。工人來了，取一隻碗和一雙筷子去。於是拿筷子的手，在籮裏拿去一塊黑饝，那瓦碗呢，却在桶裏，舀了大半碗水。（四四）</p>

<p>瑰奇卓行之士，每藉賢母之敎誨，而有所樹立，此古今中外所同也。輓近黨國賢達，社會聞人，秉母敎而奮發狀志，剏建偉業者，尤比比。民國二十三年秋，余始識郭君劍英於海上，深欽其嶽峙淵渟，不同凡器。一席傾譚，乃得詳悉其母太夫人之生平。敬作而言曰：如太夫人之聖善美德，足以傳矣！謹按：太夫人姓蕭氏，爲粤南蕭公敏基之第八女。蕭公客於檀島，以貨殖起家；雖積資豐贍，而太夫人禀性儉約，絀華屏欲，未嘗爲奢靡習谷所囿。年十八，歸郭公榮輝。越一年，誕劍英君。更越一年，郭公卽下世。太夫人旣賦寡鵠，哀不欲生。時郭公之兩親猶健在；太夫人虔侍尊章，勤撫孤子，弗逆弗怠，以敎以養，遂成一鄕之女表，而藉藉於人口。自舅姑謝世，太夫人督敎劍英君益力。蓋太夫人藉隸中山，熟聞中山先生一代偉人，其　年好學，壯歲力行，胥由於良好家敎；故居恒詔劍英君曰：爾父早世，爾當努力求學，勉秉先業。旣復曰：他日學成致用，服務社會，當以盡瘁祖國爲前提，勿以個人之席豐履厚爲已足。洎劍英君學業告成，旅澳洲，事懋遷；投足商塲，雅不願陶朱致富：關心國事，恒思效卜式輸邊。此非太夫人往昔之慇勤敎誨，曷克臻此？二十二年秋，劍英君鑒於國難日亟，不遑寗居，方遠涉重洋，作對外宣傳，並籌應急紓困之資；而太夫人適病殁里中。劍英君以不及終養，迄今追念，猶泣數行下。嗟乎丨太夫人之期望於劍英君者，而惟公而忘私，國而忘家耳；今劍英君能憂國如飢渴，我知太夫人且含笑九京，更有何憾乎？太夫人生於民國紀元前三十二年，存年五十有四。子劍英，孫男二，孫女一。</p>

<p>— 徐碧波</p>
<p>這幾年來轉變轉變的聲浪，閙得烏烟瘴氣，任你什麽一界，倘使没有新的改革，人們都在那兒聚議着，「他是落伍；」就是指文藝一方面講，文言果然是落伍透了頂，便連到語體的使用，也有好多位歡喜轉變的先生們，閙着要用大衆語來打倒它；我倒不覺想到落伍又落伍的諺語詩歌「長江後浪催前浪，世上新人換舊人，一兩句來對照這現在的景界，實在感慨系之咧！</p>
<p>不過無論什麽東西，倘使有其不可磨滅的眞價値的，任便怎樣變換，終有識者能够表着同情的；便像文言，雖然一部份人，認爲落伍，但是另有一部份人，却認爲國粹，始终保持着擁護的精神，不使它湮没凈盡的。</p>
<p>現在的武俠小說，當然也在淘汰之列，一般矯枉過正的人們，直視「武俠」兩字，和毒蛇猛獸一樣；所以民氣漸漸地消沉，成了「不抵抗」的懦怯習尙了，這眞呌有心人短氣呢！</p>
<p>我友顧明道，以病於足，不得已息影家園，專事著述，初以賺人眼涙的「啼鵑錄，」博世人歡迎，惟君以太習於頽廢，於是移轉其雄偉作風，改撰「愛國」「革命」「武俠」種種體裁的長篇作品，尤以「荒江女俠」最膾炙人口，因爲這部小說，混合着以上三種意識，描寫一個風塵女俠方玉琴，如火如荼，簡直使人讀了他的著作，要廢寢忘食的；友聯影片公司，併且探製了影片，更加風行寰宇，相得益彰，現在他的巨著第四集，又與世人相見了，他託出版這書的三星書局，送了一部來，讀後覺得承上啟下，妙緒環生，而寫玉琴生龍活虎般的姿態，眞足使人悠然意遠呢。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在這頂碩大無朋的靑紗帳裏，儘够窩藏巨數的騎隊：不要說人的身體决不會給外面的人瞧見，便是馬的脚，也是絕對不會露出來的。</p>
<p>這時候，我們所經過的一段地域，都是很荒凉的所在，在軌道兩旁，並没有什麽偉大或多量的建築物：只有一堆一堆分散着的矮屋，用破瓦遮蓋着，多分是一般窮人的巢穴，聯蔽風雨而已。還有些野生的，或已有人飼養着的走獸，如牛，羊，馬，豕，麋鹿之類，在田野裏出没着：有的把它們整個的身子浸在那些汚穢不堪的小河裏，弄得混身全是泥，看了也很可令人發笑的。太后平日對於鳥獸，原是很歡喜的，現在看它們自由自在的在野外縱跳着，當然格外容易感到興趣了。可惜伊所帶的這些人中間，從隨駕大臣起，一直到底下的小太監爲止，没有一個對於動物學特别有研究的人，否則伊一定會立刻重用起來了。</p>
<p>在關外，旣然一般也是屬於中國境内，那末有一件東西，自然也少不掉的了！那便是許多纍纍然盈野的土饅頭，丨丨死人的墳墓。中國人對於利用土地的不懂經濟原則，正是到處皆然；但在關外，野草似乎比關内長得繁盛些，所以每座墳上，都有一張碧油油的草氈舖着，而看去也就比較上美觀些了！這裏並没有什麽高山隆起，在地平綫上的，祇是這些土阜了。（一五四）</p>

<p>— （承昭）</p>
<p>蘭州地處黄河之濱，泥質肥沃，灌漑也極便利，因此居民除了種植麥子榖類外，大都以瓜果茶蔬爲「唯一」的副業。</p>
<p>每當黄昏的時候，在月色朦朧的恬靜的河面上，那些果販便很悠然地搖着小舟，到各村落去販賣下一天的貨色。一面「欵乃」地搖着，一面又哼着個「小調兒」，那種態度，怪興奮和有味的。</p>
<p>在天色還未透露魚肚白的當兒，果販們已搖着沉重的小舟歸來了，很忙碌的在洗滌「新貨」預備趕早市哩。</p>
<p>蘭州特産的名果，有蘋果，生梨，柿，呆蛋子，及沙果等幾種。西瓜，黄瓜等很少。</p>
<p>每天，每天果販所賺的錢約在二三元左右，儘够一家開銷哪！所以蘭州果販的生活，委實的很富裕的。</p>

<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>讀了張枕綠君「說開篇」·以後，使我腦海中浮起了許多没有統系的感想！</p>
<p>自從無綫電流行，家家户户，整大價丁丁當當，只聽見那絃索之聲；說書先生們總算拜着物質文明之賜，做了好一晌的好買賣，附屬品的開篇，也就跟着時髦起來。去年我曾經爲趙鶴孫編雙蝶綠彈詞、和爲朱耀祥趙稼秋編御碑亭彈詞，所以開始和說書先生們往還，他們便要求我做開篇，不免應酬一二；其實這頑藝兒實在不容易對付，做的太深了，太雅了，聽的人聽不清楚；太粗淺了，便變成東鄕調之流亞，未免敎人聽了汗毛兒站班；彈詞家祁蓮芳告訴我說；毛子堅先生很歡喜聽書，對於時人做的開篇，少所許可，惟獨稱許戚飯牛先生和我所做的開篇，說是雅俗共賞；其實戚先生以文學家並爲光裕社社員，少年時代，本有詩名，如今老了，出其餘緖，做這游戲筆墨，所調内家的作品，自是不同凡俗，至於我呢，一時高興，隨筆塗抹，那計工拙？未免辜負了毛子堅先生的稱許呢！</p>
<p>有位彈詞家，能自己做開篇，不論做的工否，總算是庸中佼佼的了！他的父親死了，他便編了一支哭父親的開篇，居然十分時髦，電臺裏幾乎每天有人點唱；其實仔細研究起來，簡直不可爲訓！你瞧古往今來，有多少詩人詞客，可曾瞧見過集子裏有哭父的詩詞？因爲罔極深恩，是不能以言語形容的，古人登高能賦，賦山川，賦兩京，可從不曾聽見有賦六合賦宇宙的，古人說的好，呌做；至哀無文，生我者一旦棄養，哭泣孺慕之不暇，那有心情尋章摘句，弄索調絃？然而話得說回來，這個年頭兒，知道「博孝名」的，尙不失爲君子，一般時髦人，不跟着陳獨秀高喊「萬惡孝爲先」的口號，已是十二分難得的囉！</p>
<p>朱耀祥出一本開篇集，呌做「書中樂」，一半是抄本的老開篇，一半是朱在電臺上播音本外埠聽衆寄給他的新作品；因爲怕有不妥的所在，所以拿一部分敎我潤色，我以爲這頑藝兒雖然小道，可是於舊詩没有相當修養的，休想能對付得了！因爲平仄其實便是天然的音節，而開篇和舊詩一樣須講平仄也。至於押韻的所在，雖然「東冬」「江陽」通用，可是須要依照蘇州的土音，譬如「時」「離」雖同隸四支，而在開篇裏，能避去最好！可見這小頑藝也有格律，倒不是率爾操觚者所能學步！</p>
<p>說書先生很能取巧，前幾天看見朱耀祥把我替他做的御碑亭中，孟月華與王有道妹妹互相調謔的一段唱片，改做了一支開篇，呌做姑嫂相謔，登在新聞夜報上。又有一家小報上，登的陳素芬情死開篇，明明是在下所做，可是被那位說書先生看中了，便寫上他的大名·算是他的大作了，眞是吃飯忘記了種田人！不過把别人的作品攘爲己有，質諸天君，怕不免有些慚愧吧？</p>

<p>春秋部編輯先生大鑒十月四日　貴報所登御香縹緲錄附言，「昨承毅　先生見告，清制非在旗大臣不稱奴才，故袁世凱覲見西太后時，應稱臣」，鄙人清末在江北提督王士珍幕中辦事，見共奏章稱奴才，王係正定府人，並不在旗，當時亦以此爲疑，嗣訽諸許豫生　文案據云凡漢籍武臣，有資格可以直接出奏者，得稱奴才，當袁世凱在北洋任内，統綰六鎭師干，覲見時稱奴才。或爲清例所許，蓋今以稱奴才爲恥，當時以稱奴才爲榮也，用貢所聞，以備參考，並請毅　先生指敎爲感，此頌撰安嚴仲文敬啟。</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>丨試騐振盪器之用法丨</p>
<p>髙週率收音機的各級調節綫路，一旦如果失掉平衡，那麽，牠的靈敏度，選擇性，音量和音質，都立刻會受到重大的影響，第七十九期本刋「振盪試騐器」　一文内，已經說過。本篇再詳述多級調節綫路較準的方法，以便讀者得窺全豹。</p>
<p>任你構造怎樣複雜的收音機，牠每級的調節綫路，總不外乎一個綫圈和一個可變電容器而已。通常調節綫路内的綫圈，差不多都是固定的，所以我們要想較準失掉平衡的綫路，便不能不在可變電容器上着手了。</p>
<p>舊式收音機内所用的多連可變電容器，設計尙未十分完善，除掉每節裹面附有小量補整電容器（見第二圖Ｔ）一只外，並無其他調節的設置，因此，較準時，也僅能在某一點纔能得到眞正的諧振，（Ｅｘａｃｔ　Ｒｅｓｏｎａｎｃｅ）此外也就無法顧及。</p>
<p>新式的收音機，採用每節頭尾兩動片改成扇形小片（Ｆａｎ·ｓｈａｐｅｄ　Ｓｅｇｍｅｎｔｓ）（見第二圖１，２，３，４，及５所示）的可變電容器後，上述的缺黠，便一掃而除！</p>
<p>第一圖，示較準調節綫路最普通之方法：先旋動收音機之多連變量電容器，至第一扇形小片探入定片内一半時爲上，（如第二圖虛綫所示之地位。（次將試騐振盪器　（七十九期内之附圖，Ｂ電池正極，直接地綫，使用時不甚便利，茲改如圖示。）　之Ａ，Ｇ兩柱，用隔離導綫（Ｓｈｉｅｌｄｅｄ　Ｗｉｒｅ）（見後述）直接收音機的天地綫接綫柱上再旋動電容器Ｃ，使與收音機諧振。此時串聯檢波管屏路内千分安培表　（如無千分安培表，改用作用靈敏之電壓表亦可。）　之紀錄，便立即增加。　（圖中所示者，係屏路檢波法。如係柵路檢波，電表數値，便見减低）再以旋鑿逐一推動各節電容器（第一節Ｃ２除外）之第一小片，同時並略動轉軸，以電表得到最大（或最小）之數値爲止。此時調節綫路内第　週波段（週率約自　Ｉ５００Ｋ·Ｃ·至ＩＩ２０Ｋ·Ｃ·各廠家出品微有不同。）之較準手續，卽告完畢。其餘第二週波段（週率約自ＩＩ２０Ｋ·Ｃ·至８４０Ｋ·Ｃ·）以迄第五週波段（週率約自６００Ｋ·Ｃ·至５５０Ｋ·Ｃ·）　之較準法，均仿此，茲不贅述。</p>
<p>調節綫路之較準法，已見上述，現在再將較準時應注意的幾點，附説於後；</p>
<p>一，收音機之天綫，必須預先除掉，以免感受外來電波之騷擾。　（但地綫必須接上。）</p>
<p>二，收音機必須置於十分乾燥之桌面上，切忌靠近金屬物，以免發生電容作用。</p>
<p>三，爲避免收音機感應振盪器射來之電波，以期週率穩定計，振盪器須裝於隔離箱内。</p>
<p>四，同上，天綫亦採用隔離導綫。地綫卽藉隔離物爲之傳遞（見第一圖）。</p>
<p>五，推動各節電容器小片之旋鑿必須採用絕緣物製成者。（參閱本期「絕緣旋鑿」）。</p>
<p>六，音量調節器，須開至最大點。</p>

<p>酷烈而煩悶的夏日總算過去了，凉爽的初秋使人增加了不少的愉快而髙興的情緖。想起玩玩超短波吧。一個髙興，便嘗試了這超短波通話的實騐。</p>
<p>我採用的綫路是Ｕｉｔｒａｕｄｉｏｎ式，Ｕｉｔｒａｕｄｉｏｎ之適用於超短波振盪器是在普通簡易綫路中値得推贊的。又爲了减少漏電損失見，屏壓接在近柵極之一端，中問串一阻流圈ＲＦＣ２。如此柵極所受之髙週率電壓，較屏極爲低了。全圖如下：</p>

<p>Ｌ１Ｌ２的製法—用小乾電池堅硬外殼一個，放入蠟中煎透。用電鈴綫在中間部份繞兩圈，相距１／１５吋，作Ｌ２。再在Ｌ２兩端相距約１／４吋跨繞兩圈。作Ｌ１。（參看圖２。）繞時須使緊貼。寛鬆後週率必致不穩定。Ｌ２卽可旋在Ｃ１不須另行接綫。</p>
<p>ＲＦＣ—用１／１８吋徑膠桿或筆管，截成一吋長者兩根，兩端先將１／４吋闊之紙條膠成一凸起物。（參閱圖３。）用３０號綫依次繞上，間隔之距離，適等於２６號綫之直徑：（繞時用一根３０號一根２６號者一同繞上，臨了將２６號綫抽去就得）</p>
<p>ＭＴ—話筒變壓器能用現成的最好。作者是用較大鐵心的低週率變壓器，次級拆去，用３２號綫繞上二百五十圈。效力也還不錯。至於話筒的開關，用插入式接綫柱可以替代。在不說話時將接綫柱拔出。話筒電池連Ａ電可用４　１／２伏脫的現成Ｃ電接法見圖１。</p>
<p>各部接綫都應該用銲錫銲牢。綫圈和調節儲電器都應和ＲＦＣ遠離。面板最好用鋁板。底板用膠板。</p>
<p>以上另件。均須置備兩付，製成超短波機兩架。</p>
<p>作者最初校騐時，Ｂ電用４５Ｖ。不生振盪。後來增至９０Ｖ時，波短部份纔生振盪。後來减小Ｃ２容量，用６７，５Ｖ　作Ｂ電時。振盪方纔穩定，所以初次校騐時。如有不生振盪之困難情形發現時。Ｃ１與Ｃ２的接綫可以暫時拆去。Ｃ２的最小容量應擇充分微小的。自製用兩條彎角銅片相對而立。釘在一條膠板上。可以遠近移動，以增减電容量。一經校準，以後不必再動，控制Ｒ２就行。Ｃ４是用作防止Ｃ２短路的。</p>
<p>這次試騐。天綫用一丈半長皮綫兩根，直立庭中。接在Ｌ１的任何一端。起初校騐時，相距極近。收得電訊幅度極狹，因爲不用微動度盤，調節頗覺吃力。電訊的强度在聽筒中聽來也不髙大。後來逐漸移遠。一二十丈處收到的電訊的尖呌聲還是這次響。這大約是幅度太狹，人耳一時辨不出來。最遠的距離就在敝社貽孫君和敝人兩者的家裏完成了。我們中間直綫距離大約有１／３里。所發的音樂和談話都很淸淅的波此收得。婉轉的Ｍｅｒｒｙ　Ｗｉｄｏｗ在耳鼓中很和柔的聽得了。没有噪擾。沒有衰落。多麽好的區域啊！</p>
<p>爲了秋季開學期已到。停止了我們的試騐。雖然這兩架機件在製作上覺得簡陋而不滿意。「包不失敗」爲了這個緣故敢介紹給想嘗試玩玩的同志們。或者改良後使牠的效力大大的增加起來。那格外好了。</p>

<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>變壓器或阻流綫圈斷綫後，卽須拆開重繞，或接其二綫端至二百二十弗打之交流電綫上，利用電錦作用使斷處自動聯接。但前者手續麻煩，使人望而生畏。後者設　短路，殊爲危險；均非善法。茲有一較穩妥之法，可解决此難題，其法如下：</p>
<p>先設法得一「火花綫圈」（Ｓｐｓｒｋ　ｃｏｉｌ。此物普通物理實騐室大多有之）　將其次級接至斷綫綫圈之二端；初級則接至一六弗打之蓄電池上，並於其間串接一瞬時開關（Ｍｏｍｅｎｔａｒｙ　Ｓｗｉｔｓｈ）以司初級圈内電流之啟閉裝置旣畢乃將瞬時開關按動，使火星花圈之初級圈内電流時啟時閉。經若干次後，該斷綫綫圈之斷處，卽可銲聯矣。若經數次通電後，仍未能銲聯，則可再增加一或二只六弗打蓄電池使爲十二或十八弗打，以銲聯之，但有時因斷處之空隙過大，此法亦不能奏效，則必須拆開重繞。</p>
<p>此法行使時，該被修綫圈内、僅有瞬時之電流流過，故並無十分危險。且能銲聯之希望較用二百二十弗打者尤大，故爲介紹。</p>

<p>— 蔡光華寄自東京</p>
<p>和世界各國一般，近幾年來無綫電廣播事業在日本的進展，也是很神奇的　。一九二五年日本全國祇有三個電台（東京，大阪和名古屋），並且都是私營性質的，這是日本廣播事業的萌芽時代。一九二六年，遞信省丨交通部丨根據英國廣播事業管理法，採用絕對政府干涉主義，援助日本放送恊會（Ｂｒｏａｄｃａｓｔｉｎｇ　Ｃｏｒｐｏｒａｔｉｏｎ　ｏｆ　ｊａｐａｎ）的成立，管理全國和電台，上述三個私營電台，當也同時在恊會登記，歸併恊會管轄。</p>
<p>至於所謂日本放恊會者，名義上標榜着「社團法人」丨受法律制裁的一種社會團體組織丨實際上大半的資本是屬於政府的，南滿鐵路株式會社，日本郵船會社等都是同樣的組織，也就是日本政府的一種深謀遠慮的策略，因爲這樣，萬一日本和任何國家開始戰爭而戰敗以後，這許多事業，才可以撑着國際公法上「戰勝國家不得侵佔戰敗國家民營事業」的愰子而受得保障，祇少，也可以有所措亂而不致全部喪失。</p>
<p>恊會的總機關設在東京，它的實際職務是禀承遞信省的意思而管理全國各電台和從事研究無綫電各項事業，因此，它的權利是有限的，當然决不會有過分的行動發生，他的經常費是很充足的，所以它是負着日本全國無綫電事業進展的責任的。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c223">關於「文學作品裏的頂點」之一談 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 牢一</p>
<p>閱十月二日自由談發表黃懷白先生所作「文學作品裏的頂點」　一文，槪論：文學作品之於頂點，猶山勢之於髙峯，海潮之於浪頭然。看山者須極其最髙峯點，觀潮者須致其突起的浪頭；而鑑賞文學作品者，一定要盼望其　「頂點」　之到臨，這是必然的道理了。否則頂點無着，重心失去，讀者感覺得沒有興趣，作品不成其爲作品了。</p>
<p>黃先生所引「紅樓夢」黛玉焚稿，「項圈」　結果是假鑽石的項圈，以及　「父與子」的巴扎洛夫之死，皆係其全書中「頂點」　之所在，全文論點甚多，蓋其癓結是如此。我們試稍一加以尋思，覺得，黃先生所說，尙有一種商榷的地方。</p>
<p>所謂「頂點」者，首先，我們便有這樣的一個疑問，在文學作品裏，是指思想的重心而言？抑是故事的結局而言呢？（這是兩件事，不能混爲一談）據其所擧引證，似乎是指故事的結局，並不在思想的重心。我們知道：紅樓夢思想的重心之點，在暴露貴族家庭之罪惡，黛玉焚稿，係其結局。項圈思想的重心之點，在對虛榮者的警示，假鑽石的項圈之告白，是其結局。至父與子的重心之點，完全在說明兩個不同的時代思想之矛盾，巴扎洛夫之死是其結局。事實顯然，無可隱蔽了。果如此，凡文學作品中，無論思想内容之種種如何，則種種如何之中，一定有一個故事的表白；而且故事的表白，一定有一個必然的結局，關於這，好像無須乎說的了。不過，我們進一層的想：「頂點」之意，在文學作品裏，似乎不僅在故事的結局而已；而是在使一個故事的結局，結得比較刺激一點，甚至使它盡量的刺激丨倘使是這，我們當另有一個論證了。</p>
<p>誰也不否認，眞正鑑賞文學作品的人，却不一定偏重在故事這一方面；尤其不一定著意於故事之結局有不有怎樣的刺激。只要，作者的思想正確，感情充實，與夫文字各方面的技術的成功，而讀者的心靈中。無論如何，總是在緊張的情緒中，一個一個字的追逐下去的。結局的刺激怎樣？「頂點」　的意象如何？他是無暇計念的了。比如：我們讀托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平一時，時時刻刻只感到它的雄渾，空闊，以及一切的無邊際，一切似有形而又無形之處，把讀者的心境，不知不覺牽引到像一種汪洋大海之中，只見茫茫然的天，茫茫然的水，茫茫然的騰霧，茫茫然的浪濤，而自身不曉得到那裏去了？當那時候，你還能想到它的結局怎樣？「頂點」如何麽？况且，「戰爭與和平」的全部結局，結得又是那末的平常，那末的一點也沒刺激，「頂點」之處，不易找出。然戰爭與和平，能不能說它不偉大呢？水滸傳的情形也是這樣，中部動人，結局無所感味，所謂全書「頂點」之所在，更是不便找出。那末，水滸一書，能不能算是一部有價値的作品呢？</p>
<p>退一步說，卽使文學作品裏，非有其所謂「頂點」之不可。那末，據黃先生所引，我們覺得除「項圈」故事之結局，不能不以一個假鑽石項圈的告白來完成其所謂全書的「頂點」以外；如「父與子」於巴扎洛夫之死，「紅樓夢」於黛玉焚稿之一事，充其量，不過在讀者的心目中，多加了一次感情的刺激而已！究竟與全書搆成之價値無所關。且焚稿一事，出之於髙鍔的續本中，曹雪芹八十回的紅樓夢並不見有；然曹雪芹的紅樓夢能不能成立，能不能有價値呢？</p>
<p>因此，我們可以知道；由於「項圈」，「父與子」，「紅樓夢」，諸書之結局的刺激，故引起了黃先生的所謂「頂點」，甚至主張文學作品裏非有其「頂點」不爲功。我則以爲文學作品裏，有「頂點」（能够稱作頂點的話）也可，無「頂點」也可。前者如「項圈」，後者如「戰爭與和平」「水滸」等是。是以文學作品之成立，完全由於作者的個性與手腕來分别其多方面的成功。「頂點」之說，似近主觀性質，未可槪其整個文學作品之意義。</p>

<p>到了嘉陵碼頭。</p>
<p>他很神秘的吸着烟，烟的霧，罩住了他的那一張白得有如電光的臉。</p>
<p>我看着那張臉就想發氣</p>
<p>然而對岸的停着的美國船其春號的汽笛已經響了</p>
<p>我只好隱忍着和他跳上了一隻划船。</p>
<p>進了三等艙。</p>
<p>他照常的又是吸烟，把左腿架在右腿上，做一種老在行，走江湖的神氣。</p>
<p>我只好瞪着眼，瞧着這人，一個同行半月，難以言狀的侶伴。</p>
<p>江水嗚嗚的呌着。</p>
<p>就這樣挨了兩天丨丨吃飯丨丨抽烟丨丨睡覺丨丨抽烟丨丨拉屎丨丨抽烟丨丨我的心情完全被這人的生活方式弄壞了。</p>
<p>然而，船已到了這個風喘，浪急，猿嘯的巫峽。</p>
<p>那時淡黃的下弦的月，正照在半腰環雲的山頭上。我們跳下了輪船，坐在划船上，輕輕的，輕輕的，泊近了夔府城磯，亂石堆成的碼頭。</p>
<p>我踏着影子，他也踏着影子，我們一齊披着月光的銀色的羽衣，踏進了這座被許多死去英雄諸葛亮李雄王建等曾細心的用冷雋的眼瞟過的城。</p>
<p>我坐着；他也坐着。我噓着長氣；他也打着吁吁的嘯了。在昏黃的燈火傍，我帶着懷古傷今的氣息，問着當地人的地方情形。他把一枝烟頭緊接着燈，也說着這樣的不合地道的話丨丨「可惜，這地方太淸靜了。」</p>
<p>我覺得這旅程已完全被戲化了。</p>
<p>我想發一點牢騷，對這人，但苦無充份的理由。我只好躊躇着，埋着頭，帶着慘敗的心情，折回了輪艙。</p>
<p>將欲回手關上三等艙的門，一隻瘦長的指爪，冒着蚯蚓狀的靑脛，緊揑着半截烟屁股的看厭了的手，已經硬挺挺的伸進了那一隻玻璃門。</p>
<p>我只好苦笑着。</p>
<p>烟，發亮的電光臉，斯文的架子腿，依舊毫不違例的刺激着我。</p>
<p>「朋友！你讀過這樣的一篇東西丨丨我的旅伴？</p>
<p>我帶着諷刺的問。</p>
<p>「唔！」他很驚奇；然而依舊很悠然的噴着很巧妙的烟圈。</p>
<p>我知道這情形是再也無法可想了。</p>
<p>到了宜昌，我决計換上了長江大輪英國船沙市號，向武昌去。</p>
<p>走進了這船二等艙第五號，我倒退了兩步，我額角淌着冷汗，我發現了一個驚人的奇蹟。</p>
<p>事情原來是這樣的。</p>
<p>他早經髙臥在第一張牀位上，陶然入夢，嘴角浮着一種得其所哉的微笑，還枕着一條新買到的美麗牌香烟！</p>
<p>我無話可說。</p>
<p>在我的心底，只是這樣的怪呌着：</p>
<p>「毒物商人？魔術師？包探？……·？」</p>
<p>我只好坦然的歸罪於命運，師罪於這一段倒霉的水程，還有啥辦法可趨避呢！</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>紐約！那是一個喧閙的，樂觀和憂鬰交雜的，說話隨便的城。城中有凉爽的電影院，有上挿雲霄的髙厦，有窮奢極侈的富翁，有衣食不給的貧漢。那是各國想得發財機會的磁石。</p>
<p>倫敦！沉浸在傳統的習慣中。你在那裏，可常常看見英皇英后乘車經過白京漢宫的大門。你在夜俱樂部中，或餐館中，會忽然覺得你自己坐在皇太子的身旁。你在艦隊街會撞着魁梧奇偉的約翰森博士的陰靈。倫敦是世界上的淸算室。</p>
<p>巴黎！是快活有趣而不負責任的。是美國富翁的娛樂處。是美姐兒，成衣工，香水製造家，廉價酒，好餐館，僥舌的男女薈萃之地。你在那裏假使少給汽車夫酒錢，他他摔在你的臉上。（等你走開了，他又會從路旁溝裏拾起來。（巴黎，牠的快樂的厚地殼，恰好把裏面一切苦楚都蓋沒了。</p>
<p>假使有人問你：「什麽地方你快要去住了？倫敦，巴黎，紐約，你選那一處啊？」</p>
<p>紐約可算得居住最舒服的城。煖氣冷氣設備的完美，什麽地方都比不過牠。住在倫敦的人，遇到極熱極冷的天，使人很不舒服，因爲住家，餐館，電影院，火車中天熱沒有冷氣，天冷沒有煖氣的。」巴黎人不喜歡新鮮的冷空氣，所以室内大都有精緻的煖氣設備、但是防熱的設備，都付闕如，一到夏季，家庭和旅館中那種悶熱，使人很難受的。</p>
<p>紐約地方尋常人家的廚房，差不多都裝有自動的洗滌器，但是巴黎倫敦兩處，只有富户能够享到這種便利。紐約因爲運輸制很完善，所以一年四季，新鮮果品和菜蔬，常常吃得着的，倫敦巴黎，到了冬季，莓和豌豆，就無從可購了。</p>
<p>巴黎的浴室，會使紐約的主婦見了淌下淚來。有一次，我和布爾喬亞階級中的幾個人住在一處，我問他們：「浴室在竹麽地方？我想洗個澡哩」。他們都很詫異地望着我，終究因爲我是英國人，聳聳肩膀，原諒我，領我到一間小黑室，便走開了。我四下一望，裏面只放着一隻小洋鐵盆，裏外都不潔凈，我躊躇了一會，决計放棄可疑的洗澡快樂，又退出了。</p>
<p>紐約除了起居舒服，還有什麽好處呢？</p>
<p>紐約的電話，是世界上最靈捷的。有一次，我住在巴黎，想發一個電話給鄰街的友人，費了二十分鐘，才接通。我曾由紐約發電話到倫敦，十分鐘便接通了。</p>
<p>紐約女子的服裝，比起巴黎倫敦來，旣廉且美，但是男子的服裝，比世界任何地方都貴。</p>
<p>紐約牙科的進步，遠出倫敦之上，歐洲牙醫只要說他是在美國留學的，便能索髙昂的手術費，這是他們唯一生財之道因爲美國人慷慨好施，所以紐約的醫院，設備很完善，爲他處所不能及。美國人在巴黎所辦的醫院，從未有一張空床。</p>
<p>倫敦居家是很好的，有一著名畫師對我說：「紐約是做事賺錢的好塲合，論到居家，我願在倫敦。看：牠的街名，像皇街啊，林肯蔭啊，種種，便很合家庭生活。至於紐約的街名，像東三十二條街啊，西六十二街啊，都是俗不可耐，令人望而生厭。」許多美國人不過爲了短遊，到倫敦去，但也有許多，爲了安樂，住在那裏的。</p>
<p>倫敦人擇交最愼，但是相交之後，畢生不忘。數年前，我在紐約時，許多人一見如故，願和我永結金蘭，信誓旦旦，使人異常感動。新近我再到紐約，只有三個人還記得我，也有離開紐約，住在他處的，其餘若干人，見面如不相識，我有時發電話給他們，那回話老是「柯拉哈姆麽？對不住，我認不得你！」</p>
<p>倫敦人冷靜而少情緒，（除在英皇英后出臨民衆之前，或著名女伶登臺之時。）他們不像紐約人或巴黎人，一時會如火熱，一時又會如冰霜之冷。</p>
<p>巴黎人的生活，和英美旅行人的生活，全然不同，他們對於外國人到巴黎行樂的，勉强含着笑臉招待，但是只要外國人肯花錢，儘管可去的。</p>
<p>巴黎人很勤勞，他們起早睡晚。餐館的烹調很好，也很潔淨。每晚紳士們大都帶了他們的太太到心愛的食所，只吃兩道菜，而談天總要費去四小時的光陰。巴黎人很愛好音樂，許多咖啡館都僱有兩三位提琴師，和一位鋼琴師。</p>
<p>巴黎的美麗，超過倫敦紐約，像三色的Ｃｈａｍｐｓ　Ｅｌｙｓｅｅｓ，，Ｔｈｅ　Ｐｌａｃｃ　Ｖｅｎｄｏｍ，和Ｔｈｅｂｏｉｓ　ｄｅ　Ｂｏｕｌｏｇｕｅ幾處地方，都是蓋世無雙的。巴黎的建築很整齊，房租比倫敦紐約都便宜。</p>
<p>巴黎人厭惡外國人，甚至於勝過英人。他們的朋輩中，難得雜一英人，或美人。他們的性格，狂蕩無覊，喜歡和人開玩笑，（尤其是頑皮的）把玩笑當作家常便飯。他們以爲生活是上帝所作的一種戲弄，人當笑樂，哭是傻子的行爲。</p>
<p>這三個大城，各有各的優點，要選擇其一，很是困難。</p>
<p>有一位很聰明的人曾說道：「每處住一年的三分之一，那才可以完全領略牠們的優點哩。」</p>

<p>這旅館沒有附設餐室，辛弟以外，僅有五個茶房。這茶房頭自己，祖威利斯是常常坐近桌子的。有兩個料理房間的女僕，她們是在早上做工，一個老僕做粗重打掃工作和一星期洗刷一次或兩次，還有那兩個小茶房丨丨一個晚工，一個夜工。但這兩個茶房已經在那裏很外，他們安排着他們所適合的鐘點。差利納脫像辛弟一樣，起初是年紀很小，但在那兒却長大了。其他一個茶房，實在不是一個小孩，而是一個老人，自從旅館開張以來他就在旅館了，辛弟很怕他，好像怕那總管一樣。</p>
<p>這位茶房的名字是喬治格勒克先生。他的制服是破爛和骯髒的，但他榮耀地穿着：他的走動宛如所有這些在旅館的重担都是他肩上似的。他知道每一件事怎樣做，每一件物件放在什麽地方，每一個老顧客歡喜什麽。他能够猜着以前在這兒住過一天的新客人的嗜好。脅肩諂笑去逢迎白種人，兇暴跋扈的對付黑種的同事，喬治是大總管，其次才是祖威利斯。他每日要找辛弟工作上的一點錯處，直至他歡喜這孩子，丨丨因爲辛弟永不曾回過他，或者諉避工作如喬治所說許多黑孩子一樣。過些時後，這老人便很少麻煩地去查察辛弟的痰盂和注意角落的灰塵了。然而，倘若一個人要想在這僑商旅館做工的，他祇讓他不快意和服從。</p>
<p>除了是那茶房頭的左右手之外，喬治也是這屋子裏的公家販私酒人。其實當他放工的時候他是藏起他的酒料在旅館的地窖裏，由差利，這另一個小茶房，給他發賣給上面房間打招呼要買的人。他們在這屋裏不做其他買賣，但這椿買賣是尋常的。一些白種女人開這些房間，</p>
<p>她們呌她們的主顧來買，可以從喬治那裏討點佣錢。</p>
<p>辛弟長時間在這旅館的工作上知道這許多詭計。「你眞是一個啞小鬼，」差利是不斷引動他。「但你祇燈了一會，將來你會懂得的。」</p>

<h3 id="c227">看他們作惡現醜到幾時？ <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— ＨＹ</p>
<p>最近，在友人處看到一本「東北消息彙刋」，實是四個勾人的字眼。</p>
<p>翻開來往下看，在目錄上印有大小相同的兩幅照片。照片是兩頁相對的，也可說是顯示出兩種相反的事實。其一，題名「願我抗日英雄竟前功」，照片是王（德林）馬（占山）蘇（炳文）李（杜）抗日各將領歸國過柏林歡迎會的留影。其一，就是本文的題目，不過綰筆者在「他」字下面給多添了一個「們」字，因爲下面還有一條說明「東北僞組織傀儡叛逆速寫一覽」，照片上的人物，是溥儀，鄭孝胥，袁金鎧，熙洽，張景惠，張海鵬，臧式毅……等。因爲是好多人，添上「們」字，看來是應該的。</p>
<p>中國人有一種最不好的惡習，就是不論遇到什麽事情，所取的步驟，不是抱着「各人自掃門前雪，休管他家瓦上霜」的宗旨，就是靜待事情的自然發展。老大的中華民族，所以淪落到如今這種地步，未嘗不是惡習傳染的。</p>
<p>筆者要說的話在這裏：東北所以鬧到現在這種地步，不能不怪罪我們自己坐以待斃，聽其自然發展的過失。自己的衣服被强盜搶去，你自己旣不想追取回來，又怪那失落的衣服生滿了霉瘡，坐看霉瘡能生到幾時，這總不是說得出口的事情。何况，就算將來有個大好人（事實上是沒有的），把失落的衣服替你追回來，那滿衣霉瘡已經失去原來本有的質地！</p>
<p>應用這個　喻，我們就對於本文題目不能不引起異議！一看他們作惡到幾時　？「看他們作惡到幾時」？如果你自己不想雪淸恥辱，收復失地，他們這些傀儡總免不掉要在人世上時時胡作非爲的。他們就算不幸都讓大疫瘟死了（這也未心是可能的），還是有新的傀儡接着登塲的。</p>
<p>所以，我們不能坐着「看他們現醜到幾時」的，我們應該揭起旗幟，去收復失地，這才是他們一羣傀儡滅亡的時候！新傀儡的肇生，自然更不可能了。</p>
<h3 id="c228">隔膜 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>隔膜如一座高牆，橫在人與人的中間，無邊無際的伸展着。隔膜，在我的心頭上一堆　蘿籘似的，跟着時日的推移漸漸地植下牢固的根起來。於是隔膜感一天天的濃厚了。因了此，就在無形中彷彿有一種了阻礙物竪立在眼前，把眼前一切的人一切的事遠遠的被分開着，都感到異樣的生疏了。</p>
<p>因隔膜同時發生對於世間冷漠之感，雖欲不孤獨總不由不孤獨着了。隔膜會分化人與人之間的親切和同情，而代替以猜忌的誤解，以至於逐漸形成離拆的結果，而這結果是個無法塡補的缺憾。除非隔膜能有一日消滅方能消滅這缺憾，可是隔膜無論如何是永遠地長植下去的，且將因紛擾複雜的人事而繼續增加着。</p>
<p>我的思想便是被它的侵蝕以致變成畸形狀態，原先我對於身外世界本絕無所憎惡，然而，現在不知怎的我對一切都極厲害的憎惡起來。尤其是人，每天所接觸的或是熟，或是生的人。</p>
<p>時常逢着在某種塲合上，有些人談得够起勁，自己亦是發言者對象之一，他所說的也許我有靜心聽一聽的必要，但是，我總沒有這樣的心思，人說他的，我儘管想我的；便是偶然扯上我的身來，我仍然不能起什麽内在的反響，還是當作聽不見瞧不見似的，老以爲人們所談的我並不是坐在那兒的我，而是另一個看不着的我。</p>
<p>誰也沒有像我自己知道自己的深切的。</p>
<p>如果碰着單一個人來找我的話，此時我的痛苦就不可言了。不問對方的表情如何懇摯，話的如何有親密味，我根本就認定那是在作假，嘴笑心不笑的一種虛僞的表現，對方給予我的只是無名的反感，反感，第三個反感。他儘在興高采烈的談呀說的，我心裏邊則儘在作惡。然而，面當面，雖不願聽亦不得不打着像是很留神的嘴臉，這種難堪的遭遇不知有多少遍了。多了一次像那麽完全勉强的周旋，隔膜感卽跟着加厚。到了最後，幾乎連自己都不相信自己了。</p>
<p>每一個人都是各自分離着生活似的　每一個的情感思想亦都爲隔膜的高牆攔阻着。也曾細細反省，這說不定是自己神經過敏的懷疑。實並不，前幾天在路上邂逅一個多年不見的可說是很有交情的舊同學，我重又深深地　着稀有的隔膜感了。當時一瞧見他，便情不自禁的嚷着，熱烈地和他握手，接着問東問西，問他這幾年的日了可過得寫意，我是如從前一樣的表示着最大的親暱。然而料不到他却變了，他已不是我記憶上數年前的他，我問他一大串話，他祗短短應了幾句，而且紅着臉，神情亦十分不自如，像逢到一個初次見面的陌生人似的。這是怎麽一回事呢？最後我邀他揀一個地方吃點東西，可以談個痛快，他也不好意思似的，說有事體婉詞拒絕了。分手後，我茫然若有所失，在熙熙攘攘的路上走着，却感到獨行於無人烟的荒郊一樣。人之隔膜我亦如我之隔膜人，都各各隔膜着的過着日子呵！</p>
<h3 id="c229">船中 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 辛</p>
<p>流浪人是這麽輕易的，來去不定。昨夜還不大定神的睡在韓山麓的故校内，絞着無限的悵惘；明天便怱怱又再踏過湘子橋，登車駛向汕島。弄了點兒錢，買好船票，離開故鄕了。</p>
<p>船開了，故鄕在我迷茫的腦海中，好像沉没沒了似的。我的心神給船中的一切吸住了。肚子是空空的，但這樣組亂難堪的浪入的生活，使人不能痛快的嚥下飯去。錢是不充分，時間又急，小菜就不嘗買，可以說是太疏忽些吧！飯吞了兩口就放下去。船搖得這樣，本來已昏頭昏腦的人更加支持不住。就倒下去，安靜的忍着三天三夜吧？好容易過了個夜，早上人家起來洗臉吃粥，飲牛奶。勉强爬上來看看，虛暈十足的還是仍舊倒下去妥當些。</p>
<p>風更大了，船搖動得滿船騷動起來，行李自己會跳。風和雨就直飄打到蹲在厠所旁這近船旁的流浪人，什麽都濕了。緊抓住東西，靠在船壁上，忍着快要嘔出來的酸和難堪的東西，面色是靑白的。厠所大小便的嗅氣，是沒有閒情領受了。暈，痛，懶，酸，餓，連倒下去的地方都沒有。暗自呌苦以外，再沒有别的辦法了！比什麽都痛苦呵，船中窮苦的流浪人！弄到船快到時，人已經像病了好幾天了。瘦削的臉，像貼了黃紙。船進吳淞口，人家多半收拾好行李，穿整衣服，高興的在等着上岸了，但這流浪人却搶着暫舖着羣蓆子，倒下去躺下了。船進黃浦江，外灘近在眼前，這才整一下子破舊的西裝。</p>
<p>「流浪到這大都市裏來了！」他低微的自語着。</p>

<h3 id="c230">飄泊者 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>在前年的秋天，吾們鎭上突然地出現了一位衣衫襤褸的怪客，不知從那里來的却沒有人知道；然而鎭上的人大都用着驚訝的，疑惑的眼光去注視他的。他到了這里，就在離鎭上不上半里路的一只破土地祠里住下了。他來的時候，沒有帶舖蓋和行李，祇挾着一個小包裹，携着一支洞簫，便飄飄然的飄到了這里來。再奇怪的，自從他到了這里，差不多已經一年，但他旣不做去什麽賣買，更不曾向人乞食；並且從沒見他向任何一個人說過一句話兒。就是人家見了他也不過平淡地瞥他一下，誰也沒有工夫去注意他。</p>
<p>自他來了之後，這個小小的鎭上，便每在晨光熹微之時，或月白風淸之夜，無論春夏秋冬，總要聽到一種動人的嗚嗚溜溜的聲音，那末悠揚的，那末悲凉的，在這深夜里或破曉前使人聽了，彷彿空谷猿鳴，嫠婦悲泣；使得這週遭的環境，都充滿了蒼凉的氣雾丨這是傷心人的悲歌，這是飄泊者之心曲！他啊！他也是一個悽凉落寞的可憐人兒呵！</p>
<p>吾討厭這種逗人的音調，但吾却又愛聽這音調；當每次聽到了這簫聲，便使吾想起了自己，追懷到往事，也不自覺的撲朔朔地流着熱淚。吾深深的感覺到他的身世和吾一樣的可憐！命運一樣的惡劣！遭遇一樣的悲痛！</p>
<p>有一天的晚上，吾聽到了這聲音，實在不能睡覺了；就披衣起了床，輕輕地開門出去。這時恰好一圓凉月髙髙地掛在樹梢，吐出它幽幽的柔光；把這大自然里照成了一個美麗的銀色世界。碧藍的天幔上，閃鑠着不少的星星，好像在替月姊助威而要想戰勝這黑暗的世界；草坪里的秋蟲，也似乎已感到生命將殘的悲哀！一陣一陣的凉風，襲在吾僅穿了一件薄衣的身上，覺得有些寒冷。</p>
<p>這一切的組織，都給那悲凉的調子奏成一個悲凉的世界。但吾依舊尋聲而往；走到一座柏樹林里，向着一條漫長的墓道上走去。那聲音更近了，吾猜準這聲音一定就在這裏發出的。在這時，吾感到那空氣陰森得可怕；但終於鼓足了勇氣，向前走去，走去。果然，在墓前的一條小木橋上，坐着一個人，把一支洞簫凑在嘴角上吹着。</p>
<p>然而當吾走近那小木橋時，簫聲突然止了，再看看橋上，人已不知所在；吾不禁感到失望！站上橋去，向四下望望，又沒有一個人影。這時吾好像匆匆若有所失，覺得眼前是無涯際的寂寞，空虛，悲哀！</p>
<p>從那一天起，這鎭上，這墓前，這土地祠里，便失却了這個衣衫襤褸的飄泊者了。就是晨光熹微之時，或月白風淸之夜，從不會聽到這動人的聲調了。</p>
<p>「這是怎末一回事？」吾始終是這樣的懷疑着……</p>
<h3 id="c231">小丑的悲哀 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>記得童年時在北方一個古城裏，日暮時走過故居前面的一塊荒地，往往看見許多人圍了一個類似小丑的人物在鑑賞他的「民間藝術」，那人拱拱手，做出許多可笑的姿態，因而赢得觀衆的讚嘆，把些銅錢擲了過去，等到人們漸漸散盡，只剩他一人緩緩歸去的時候，我注意到他眉宇間所流露出的疲倦，那一步一顚地凄凉景象，眞比方纔那些把戲還能動人。那時自己年紀還小，不大懂得什麽人生的悲哀，可是那含有喜劇悲劇兩種意味的經過，却不斷地在刺激我弱小的心靈，在渴望着解答。</p>
<p>最近幾天從浙江路偷鷄橋一帶走過，常常可看到幾家小商店的門首，站立着全部小丑裝束的人，有的竟塗着腮臉，在怪聲呌呼着希望人們來進店買東西。當我看到這樣一種古怪的形象時，我是被引誘得站住了，我和另一些爲同一原因而停止行進的人們擁擠地堆到那小丑的面前去，那戴着尖帽穿着花衣的怪物便在人們驚訝聲中手舞足蹈地講說起來。當然，那景象是非常滑稽。不過也許因爲過度滑稽的原故，那些已經擠到門口的人們都把全神貫注在小丑的鑑賞上面，而忘了進去買東西，指手劃脚裝腔做勢只成了徒然的努力，結果人們在一陣轟笑中散走了，說句實話丨這時雖已是深秋，可是在那小丑的臉上，還可依約地看出一些涔涔的汗珠。</p>
<p>我想笑，然而那汗珠使我沉默下去了。</p>
<p>我們生活在世上，陳在我們前後左右的原有不少笑料，這些笑料往往以新奇的刺激使我們不由自主的笑了起來，可是在暄笑聲裏，却很少有人突然沉默下來，去揭開歡笑的外幕而看看那内在潛伏的悲哀之本質。在剛剛看到小丑時，我們應會得笑上兩三聲的，可是笑過之後再去嚴肅地思考一下，就會發現這</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>喧囂裏含有多少凄凉，這滑稽裏含有多少辛酸，所謂扮小丑引人發鬆者，其實全是因爲度着無情的生活的鞭撻使然。在前一種小丑的心裏，不知在思忖着什麽家裏等着飯吃的老母弱子，在後一種小丑的心裏，不知多們焦灼地在企望從這經濟衰落市面不景氣的局面中，替自己這小本經營在垂危中保留下一綫生機。這正好比包着糖衣的藥丸，在甜的外衣下蒙藏着難吃的苦劑。人們往往因爲那外面滋味的甜，遂把裏面的苦處遺忘了。</p>
<p>其實，所們所見到的又何等有限，凡是風塵中强顔歡笑的娼妓。曲意拍馬的到處逢迎的小職員，撑持着疲倦向人們遞送秋波的舞女，何嘗不是這輾轉於生活重壓下連呻吟都不敢呻吟的可憐的生物？</p>

<h3 id="c233">一個灰色的故事 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>一年容易又秋風，度了幾年小學校長的淸苦生涯，又踏進了上海的最髙敎育機關丨市敎育局，開始幹起社會敎育的工作，在繁複的工作中，差幸又認識了一些人生的意義，社會的痛苦。</p>
<p>這是一個灰色的故事，滲雜着不少凄楚的意味。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的，局長接到市長的令函，說是有一個失學失業的靑年，在日暮途窮的境地中，希望市長救濟他。而這一件工作，恰巧輪到我身上。</p>
<p>先把這一個靑年上市長的信詳細看了一遍，文筆雖然那麽幼稚，他姓黃，生長在四川自貢市，家庭還不差，所以還能在榮縣文學專門學校讀書二年，終因爲土匪兵匪的蹂躪，文官武官的横征暴歛，使他一家人口的生活，弄到不能維持的地步，他憧憬着上海的繁華，他想上海的確可以給他一條生路，於是他開始踏上征途，走到這東方的巴黎，可是東方的巴黎，在一方面固然是繁榮，在另一方面郤也是飢饉，他開始感覺到失望了，他更感覺到前途的危險，他已受到飢餓的侵迫了，他在這蒼茫的征塵中！向市長發出呼救的凄號。</p>
<p>他住在中央公寓，一間狹小黑暗的房間。我跑進去的時候，他正在寫信，請求社會人士救濟的信，他已經生了病。我說明了來意，他立刻現出驚惶的樣子，他想不到一封信竟動了市長的仁慈，派員澈查。他把他的境地如信上所寫的告訴我一遍，並且把他的家鄕四川的情形·很詳細的叙述，我就對他説；「上海也是沒有辦法的，你還是回去好，你有家庭，有父母，回去不比在上海好得多吧？」他感傷的說道；「回去也是一條死路呀！現在的自貢市，回去除當兵投匪以外，絕沒有第二條生路，回去幹什麽呢？而且茫茫長途，怎樣的回去？」接着，他翻出他父親給他的一封信，他説；「我的父母也閙飢荒了！」我把信詳細的看一遍，大意是；「在這四面楚歌，衣食不週的生活，使我感覺到人生的無意義。家庭，再也不能住下去了，不知道你在外面有了寄托沒有？」我更加感到重壓，我再也不能坐下去了，安慰他幾句，就跑出了中央公寓。</p>
<h3 id="c234">憂鬱的心 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 尼琪</p>
<p>將憂鬱的心安放在彈簧椅上，合在眼睛享受這二小時的安適，這是個奇怪的消遣，我以理髮作爲對象，已是許多時候了。</p>
<p>秋天，灰色的季節，懷了顆憂鬱的心踅上霞飛路。兩手揷在褲袋裏，安閑地端詳着　一家美麗的窗飾，就這樣進了按着「電燙三元」的理髮店了。</p>
<p>彈簧椅驅走了那顆憂鬱的心。</p>
<p>「修面？」穿白制服的問我。</p>
<p>「理髮。」回答了。旋過頭來向鏡中望去，笑了笑；掄起指來計算，不滿十天哩。</p>
<p>理髮匠懷疑地工作起來。</p>
<p>「安適的消遣啊！」忖着。</p>
<p>秋天的日子，短的，周圍的電炬全亮了，反箭兩手穿秋大衣的時候，對鏡中的女子笑着向我招呼。</p>
<p>「那個憂鬱的主人啊！」歸來的心低微地呼着。</p>
<p>僕歐灣着腰，敝開了門，秋風像箭，刺痛了我憂鬱的心，反上衣領，望着自家兒脚尖向前走了。</p>
<p>從每個美麗的窗飾前掠過，耳畔送來了輕微的聲音：</p>
<p>「爲什麽不理我呢？剛才我招呼了你二次呢！」憂鬱的　丨心的主人啊！</p>
<p>「對不起，沒有聽見，」搖着頭，「今天我沒有想到去理髮的。」</p>
<p>「這是意外的收獲吧！」</p>
<p>「我們似乎這樣說過的。」</p>
<p>「請你原諒，我跟他到外埠去的，回來沒有一個月。你收到我的信嗎？」</p>
<p>「我知道的。丨丨你沒有向我道歉的必要！」</p>
<p>從每個美麗的窗飾前掠過，我到了家。</p>
<p>「再會，希望下一次的　「意外的收獲」！」</p>
<p>「你搬了家，什麽時候？」</p>
<p>「去年和你分别的下一天。」</p>
<p>「那沒有收到我的信？」</p>
<p>「都收到的，謝謝你。我們再會罷。」我轉身掏鑰匙開門。</p>
<p>「你太殘酷了！」她幾乎哭了。</p>
<p>我想接受這意外的收獲，但是心兒告訴我，她是憂鬱的主人啊，你以後再也不能坐在彈簧椅上享受二小時的安閑了。</p>
<p>門隔住了外面的秋風，我無力地仆到臥床上，和我憂鬱的心。</p>

<p>Concerning Legal Principles and Criminal Responsibility</p>
<p>Both Passed the Second Reading According to Amendments</p>
<p>…………………………………………………………</p>

After the members expressed their opinions and debated each other, the articles passed the second reading according to the amendments until noon, when the chairman announced a recess. The review continued at 2 PM. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued its review of Chapter 3, Criminal Responsibility, of the Criminal Law amendment at 2:30 PM on the 19th, and the entire chapter passed the second reading according to the amendments. During the discussion of the age of culpability for minors in this chapter, the members debated fiercely. Fu Bingchang, Cheng Zhonghang, Lou Tongsun, and others argued that the amendment stipulating that the behavior of those under the age of fourteen would not be punished, considering fourteen years old too high, firmly advocated maintaining the existing Criminal Law's old standard of thirteen years old, but were defeated due to lack of support. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 9 AM on the 20th. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Kejun, Luo Chaojun, Luo Ding, Sheng Zhenwei, Zhao Chen, Shi Yan Kuan, Lin Bin, Cai Xuan, Qu Zengze, and Xu Yuangao, members of the Criminal Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, reported to President Sun and Vice President Shao on the amendment process of the Criminal Law. The original report stated that in December of the 20th year, they were ordered by the Yuan to revise the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law. In September of the 21st year, they began to revise the Criminal Law, completing the revision of the General Provisions by the end of the year. In March of the 22nd year, the Criminal Law Committee held a meeting to re-examine the General Provisions, completing it in April. They then went to Tianjin, Jinan, Pinglu, Xi'an, Suzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to investigate the judiciary and prisons in various places as a reference for the revision. They held a meeting in Qingdao in July and completed the revision of the entire Criminal Law in January. After another review, they completed the first draft of the Criminal Law amendment in December, totaling 345 articles. It was published and sent to the Ministry, forwarded to courts at all levels in various provinces, and directly sent by the committee to lawyers' associations, law schools of various universities, and law journals to solicit opinions. In April of this year, the Criminal Law amendment was completed. Based on the opinions of Minister Luo Wengan, Director Dong Kang, and advisors Bao Dao and Lai Banya, the amendments were re-organized, resulting in twelve chapters and ninety-seven articles in the General Provisions and thirty-five chapters and two hundred and fifty-three articles in the Special Provisions, totaling three hundred and fifty articles. Compared to the current law, forty articles were added, seventy-three articles were deleted, two hundred and sixty-nine articles were amended, and forty-five articles remained unchanged. The draft was revised four times, and a total of 148 meetings were held. This is a general description of the Criminal Law amendment process. As for the standard of this Criminal Law amendment, given that the current law has been in effect for several years and has deeply penetrated the minds of general judges and the public, it is not appropriate to make too many changes. Therefore, on the one hand, we referred to recent foreign legislative examples, such as the 1932 Polish Criminal Law, the 1931 Japanese Criminal Law Amendment, the 1930 Italian Criminal Law, the 1928 Spanish Criminal Law, the 1927 German Criminal Law Draft, and the 1926 Soviet Criminal Law, etc., for reference. On the other hand, we relied on the findings of the investigation and, according to the actual situation of the current level of judges, prison facilities, public education, and social environment in our country, carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of the original articles of the current law, in order to achieve perfection. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has 82 key points of the Criminal Law amendment. Liu Kejun reported to the assembly on the 19th on the most important points of the amendment: (1) The "Definitions" chapter in the current law's General Provisions contains provisions on kinship already covered by the Civil Law. The remaining articles are all interpretations of the text and are summarized into one article, attached to the "Legal Principles" chapter. Some of the "Time Limits" are stipulated in the Civil Law, some in the prison regulations, and the remaining article on the calculation of prison terms is incorporated into the "Punishment" chapter. Therefore, the "Definitions" and "Time Limits" chapters are deleted. The "Discretionary Punishment" chapter and the "Increase and Decrease" chapter are combined into one chapter, making the discretionary punishment, increase, and decrease of punishment more concise. A new chapter on "Security Measures" is added. The scope of election crimes in the current law's Special Provisions is too narrow, so this amendment changes it to crimes obstructing voting. The forgery of public bonds, stocks, postage stamps, and other valuable certificates are all stipulated in the "Forgery of Documents" chapter, which seems inappropriate, so this amendment divides it into two chapters. The exploitation of exorbitant interest is heinous and is explicitly stipulated for punishment in the chapter on fraud and breach of trust, named "Fraud, Breach of Trust, and Usury Crimes." (2) The proviso below Article 2 is different from the principle adopted below the proviso of the current Article 2. The current law only imposes a lighter sentence. This amendment changes it to the law that is most favorable to the offender. This is one aspect. The current law only compares the laws at the time of the act and at the time of the judgment. This amendment requires comparison of the laws after the act but before the judgment, applying the most favorable law among them. Since the principle of leniency is adopted, the most lenient interpretation should be considered, not limiting it to the act being lighter at the time of the act. If the new law believes that a certain act in the old law does not need to be punished, and the judgment according to the old law has not been executed or is not completed, the execution of the punishment is waived. (3) The reason for establishing a chapter on security measures is that the current law's various provisions on reformatory education, supervision of conduct, imprisonment, and parole control rules are the provisions of what this amendment calls security measures, but the scope is too narrow. For example, those who commit crimes due to opium addiction, alcoholism, laziness, or habitual criminality are only subject to punishment, which is not enough to achieve the purpose of improving the offender. Therefore, recent legislative examples in various countries have provisions for security measures, which our country should imitate. For example, drug rehabilitation centers, such as those already set up in the Qingdao and Shanghai concessions, are among the security measures. This is to consider the domestic situation and follow the world trend, shifting from punitive principles to defensive socialism. (4) It is proposed to raise the age of responsibility to under fourteen years old for leniency and to under eighteen years old. Because education is not widespread in our country, and juveniles unfortunately commit crimes, emphasis should be placed on education, not using prison terms as a method of improvement. Therefore, most legislative examples raise the age of responsibility, and security measures are used to assist them. (5) Instigators are particularly malicious and should be punished independently, shifting from an objective perspective to emphasizing the subjective perspective. (6) The provisions on the execution of penalties in the chapter on types of punishment are to be stipulated in the execution section of the Criminal Procedure Law or the Prison Law, so they are deleted. (7) Article 54 of the current law has five provisions regarding deprivation of civil rights: 1. Civil servants, 2. Voters and those eligible to be elected, 3. Enlisting in the military, 4. Teachers in official and public schools, 5. Lawyers. This law only stipulates civil servants, and the others are relegated to other laws. Moreover, during the discussion of the Conscription Law in the Yuan, a majority advocated not imposing restrictions. (8) Conversion of short-term imprisonment into fines is adopted in the Provisional Law. In principle, there should not be such articles, but in fact, there are often difficulties. Often, due to family, occupation, and other reasons, serving a prison sentence is very unfavorable to the offender, and it is better to convert it into a fine. The current law deletes it, and many courts advocate restoring it. Therefore, this amendment has forty articles stipulating a limit of imprisonment of six months or less, with strict restrictions. (9) Deduction of detention time is stipulated in the current law as two days equaling one day, which is reasonable, but in actual inspections of various detention centers, most are worse than prisons. Therefore, this amendment changes it to one day equaling one day. (10) The maximum amount of fines is currently stipulated as five thousand. This amendment raises it to ten thousand. However, sometimes the benefits gained from a crime often exceed the fine by several times. Imposing a small fine is insignificant. Therefore, this amendment gives judges the power to increase the fine within the scope of the benefits gained. (11) In cases under the jurisdiction of the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecutor can decide not to prosecute, but the principle of expanding the scope of private prosecution has been decided by the Political Council. Therefore, all victims can directly file a private prosecution with the court. If the court believes that the circumstances are clearly pardonable after the private prosecution, there seems to be no need for punishment. Therefore, Article 60 is added to this amendment. (12) The habit of corruption among civil servants is generally considered to require urgent correction. The central government has repeatedly made resolutions on punishing corruption. Therefore, this amendment particularly increases the penalties for various articles on bribery of civil servants. Other articles concerning civil servants are also increased, and new provisions are added for civil servants who do not perform their duties, abandon land, or overstep their authority in accepting civil and criminal lawsuits, or for prison guards and escorts who abuse or neglect their duties, causing disasters, all to be strictly punished. (13) Examinations are one of the five powers and are extremely important. The Criminal Law should have appropriate provisions to prevent abuses. The Examination Yuan has also sent its opinions. Therefore, Articles 135 and 130, paragraph 2, are added to this amendment. (14) Commercial credit should be greatly maintained. There is often a type of deception in our country's markets where goods are falsely labeled as being from a certain country. This behavior must be punished, and those who sell such goods are also shameless and must also be punished. (15) Opium and other drugs should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, the penalties for each article in the chapter on opium crimes are appropriately increased. Morphine and other drugs are even more harmful than opium, so the penalties are further increased. Most of the other reasons are detailed in the amendment's main points. Increases, decreases, or amendments that are unimportant or obvious are not explained. If there are any doubts during the discussion of the articles in the future, a detailed explanation will be given. This is a general description of the Criminal Law amendment. Please discuss whether it is appropriate. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Believes It is Still Far From Reality</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the previous note from the Ministry of Finance to the United States regarding the silver issue, it was proposed that the two countries exchange gold and silver to achieve a common goal, and it was mentioned that the Chinese government would gradually prepare to adopt the gold standard. According to Ma Yinchu, the US reply did not give a positive answer to our proposal for the gold-silver exchange. It stated that all countries currently purchasing gold and silver can conduct government-to-government transactions in the open market, which has never been implemented, clearly stating that it is impossible. The reply concluded by saying that friendly discussions could be held in the future, but this was merely a friendly gesture, unwilling to refuse outright. General observation suggests that the US-China gold-silver exchange is merely a wish. The Ministry of Finance's statement that it is preparing to gradually adopt the gold standard probably refers to the virtual gold standard of the (Kemmerer) plan. I personally believe that it is still far from reality because our country currently has no gold reserves at all. Where would we start? (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Silver Export Tax and Balancing Payments - Su <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since our Ministry of Finance announced the silver export tax, the international reaction to this policy seems to be somewhat of an "overreaction." All sorts of discussions, such as "joining the gold-pound group" and "the Chinese are smarter than the Americans," are all one-sided speculations. It should be known that when a new policy is first established, it is inevitably experimental. Even President Roosevelt's Blue Eagle movement did not shy away from admitting to experimentation. As long as the goal is righteous and everyone can cooperate sincerely, then this policy can at least achieve some effectiveness. What is the goal of the Ministry of Finance's new policy? It is very simple.</p>
<p>Our country is a silver standard nation that must pay a huge amount of merchandise import surplus each year. The price is that there is no huge amount of gold and silver to be extracted from the ground within the country for payment. Therefore, the silver circulating among the people and reserved in banks is the only tool available for international payment. If the outflow of silver is too great, taking emergency measures is a very natural result. The fiscal authorities' collection of silver export tax this time was originally an emergency measure taken in response to the US policy of raising silver prices, but its goal is only to exert the spirit of self-defense and does not mean to target any country. As for directly banning silver exports or announcing the adoption of the gold standard, although they may seem to have the same effect on the surface, it is not as good as taxation, which can still maintain flexibility. At the same time, taxation can also avoid many difficulties in terms of authority, because the obstruction of foreign advisors in tax rights is limited after all.</p>
<p>However, in the end, we must still ask: can the goal of protecting domestic silver be achieved solely through taxation? And can it embody the basic meaning of national economic policy? This is a rather complicated question. First, the meaning of this question can be regarded as preventing smuggling. Although the higher the tax, the greater the temptation for smuggling, as long as the government and the financial industry can fully cooperate, there is no difficulty. Second, from another perspective, if preventing the outflow of silver is to have a perfect ending, the root cause of the outflow must be fundamentally resolved. If the resolution is appropriate, not only will silver not flow out, but it may also flow in. This is the issue of massive imports of foreign goods. Third, the goal of taxation is, of course, self-defense, but the current trade import surplus is very large, and if silver cannot flow out, foreign exchange will become expensive. Isn't this to stand against the inflationary movement abroad? If foreign goods imports do not shrink daily, our self-defense principle will be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>According to the above, collecting export tax is indeed the most appropriate policy. However, if there are no active supporting methods to reverse the current imbalance in international payments, then this appropriate policy will not easily be effective. The fiscal authorities are currently organizing a foreign exchange equalization committee, and it seems that various active supporting methods are gradually becoming realized. This is naturally a move that meets the needs of the times.</p>

<p>Appears to Accept Japan's Proposal for Total Tonnage System</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Believes It Is Just Lip Service</p>
<p>(Washington) US senior naval authorities today slightly revealed their recognition of Japan's need for equality and safety, and at least partially accepted its total tonnage plan. These experts stated that if naval powers reduce armaments based on absolute safety, Japan's position, surrounded by sea, is not easily attacked by enemies, which is completely different from Britain's proximity to Europe and the United States' vulnerability to British and Japanese attacks. Therefore, its special safety position accounts for 35%, and the remaining 65% can be supplemented by naval strength. Speaking of the universal tonnage system, Japan can freely build appropriate warships. Because Britain and the United States lack geographical security, they should have 100% of naval power to be on par with Japan. Therefore, according to this proposal, Japan's total tonnage should be increased by 5% compared with the current 5:5:3 ratio between Japan, Britain, and the United States. Britain now opposes the total tonnage plan, but may agree to reduce the number of cruisers with 8-inch and 6-inch caliber guns on the principle of partial reciprocal numbers as a solution to the problem. It is learned that the US naval authorities are quite in favor of Japan's total tonnage plan, as this would allow the United States to build larger warships. The United States has remote territories, and its defense problem is more suitable for large warships. (18th Guomin Telegram)</p>

The US proposes revising the talks into a three-nation (US, UK, Japan) roundtable conference. Japanese opinions on this will be sought. The US strongly agrees to holding a roundtable conference. The US is currently concerned that Yamamoto's proposal to limit armaments based on total tonnage will lead to an arms race that representatives are trying to avoid. They believe that the talks should be based on "their comparative naval needs." Americans are also citing British submarine wartime experiences to refute Japan's claim that submarines are not offensive weapons. Britain, France, and Italy all wish to continue the Washington Naval Treaty or negotiate a similar London Naval Treaty to replace it.

<p>(Tokyo) With the London preparatory conference about to reopen, the highest authority of the US delegation has announced the US attitude, stating that the US is prepared to avoid wording regarding the ratio of naval power, etc., so as not to hurt the self-esteem of various countries. However, they still cannot agree to Japan's proposal to abolish or reduce offensive military strength and Britain's proposal to reduce battleship size. The US will insist on the principle of large ships and big guns. How much concessions will be made is another matter, but they will always adhere to this principle. Awaiting the Japanese Navy's intentions on this matter, the following is stated: If the US still insists on the principle of large ships and big guns, then the threat to Japan and other countries lies in this, which fundamentally contradicts the principle of non-threatening and non-aggression. It is useless to use words like "relative necessity" or "relative security guarantees" instead of ratios. The problem is not in the wording, but in the substance. Therefore, Japan is absolutely opposed to limiting Japan with relatively differential naval power. (Den-tsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese naval authorities have clarified the direction of the London Preparatory Conference to the US Navy, observing that the "some concessions" mentioned by the US are a blank slate. It is ridiculous for the US to talk about concessions when it has not yet proposed anything for this initial consultation. If the US insists on transoceanic operations, Japan and other countries will be threatened, which is contrary to the principle of non-threatening and non-aggression. The US is quite concerned that Japan dislikes the Washington Naval Treaty. However, abandoning this treaty is the exercise of a treaty right, and is only intended to establish a fair and appropriate new treaty. Terminating the word "ratio" and using words such as "relative necessity" or "relative security guarantee", the problem is not in the wording, but in the reality. If Japan is limited with relatively differential naval power, Japan will absolutely oppose it. (Den-tsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy Ministry has decided to appoint Vice Admiral Takahashi Sankichi, the current commander of the Second Fleet, as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet on November 15. Admiral Nagano Osami, Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, will be appointed as a military councillor. Admiral Nagano served as the plenipotentiary representative of the Navy at the disarmament conference last year, so he will enter the Military Council. (United Japanese Press, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) After the delegations of the US and Japan participating in the initial naval talks arrive here, it will take a considerable amount of time before the talks begin. Various rumors have therefore arisen in political circles. The *Daily Herald* reports, "Last night, someone said that the plan brought by Yamamoto, the chief Japanese expert, has already been submitted to the British experts. But as far as we know for certain, the British Foreign Office's Naval Department knows nothing about the Japanese plan other than the points announced by the Japanese themselves. In addition, someone else rumored that the purpose of adopting a bilateral talk format for this initial talk is to allow the UK and Japan to reach a compromise first, and then seek US consent. But as far as we can see, aside from whether the Japanese side has this intention, it is unknown, the British side absolutely does not have this intention." The *News Chronicle* believes that the Japanese representative Yamamoto may spend the weekend holiday with Prime Minister MacDonald in the Cotswolds area. The *Morning Post* took the opportunity of the German pocket battleship "Deutschland" cruising in Scotland to point out the uselessness of naval tonnage limits, saying that this limit is very easy to circumvent. For example, the German pocket battleship is only 10,000 tons, but its equipment is complete. It can easily be converted into an aircraft carrier if necessary, and the ship is equipped with six 280mm guns and eight 150mm guns. Even if it encounters an enemy ship more than three and a half times its tonnage, it can resist, and it can travel 10,000 nautical miles without adding fuel, with a speed of 20 knots per hour. Its armament even exceeds all battleships. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Rome) According to today's official announcement, Italy's two 35,000-ton new cruisers are scheduled to be laid down on October 28 in Trieste and Genoa. Premier Mussolini ordered the allocation of 480,000,000 lire for the construction of new ships during the naval conference convened in Geneva earlier this year. The news of the construction of the two ships was announced this summer during the naval negotiations held in London, drawing attention to Italy's attitude. Mussolini insists that the Italian Navy should be equal to France. However, even if France recognizes its demands, it is questionable whether Italy wants to be on par with the French Navy. After the completion of the two 35,000-ton new cruisers, the Italian naval power will still be far below the limits of the London Treaty. (National News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) Today's editorial in the *Times* of London criticizes the confusion in China's exchange rates, saying that it is unclear to London business circles whether the Chinese government's actions are wise in practice. Critics believe that it is doubtful whether exchange rates can be fixed artificially, regardless of the price of silver. On the surface, the Chinese government's move clearly stems from concerns about China's export trade, as China's export trade has recently felt the negative impact of silver prices. However, high silver prices strengthen the purchasing power of Chinese currency, which can promote China's import trade. No government should consider this difficult problem solely from the standpoint of trade benefits, because import and export trade are equally important in a broad sense. Sharp exchange rate fluctuations, if artificial, can further disrupt export and import trade. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Elko, Nevada, USA Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senator from Nevada, formerly a fervent supporter of the silver faction, recently declared, "If the Chinese government believes that restricting silver exports is beneficial, it certainly has the absolute right to restrict exports." Recent discussions about China's imposition of silver export taxes are all meaningless, as all governments can freely protect their monetary system. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Due to China's imposition of a silver export tax, currency exchange in Dalian has been extremely active this week, reaching 10 million yen per day. The number of transactions per day ranges from 20 million to 30 million yen, and has not decreased so far. This intense trend has caused turmoil in the exchange market. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>The Pound Falls Due to Seasonal Pressure</p>
<p>(London) London financiers believe that today's surge in Chinese exchange rates is a natural reaction to the recent decline, as the recent decline may have been excessive. However, there are many reasons for this, for the balance of Chinese trade. The general opinion is that the price of silver, which was suppressed by speculative selling, will inevitably rise, but no one is willing to express an opinion on the outcome of the so-called Sino-US silver war. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Has the seasonal decline of the pound sterling ended, or is the large-scale replenishment by European debtors the reason for the pound's turnaround? Market participants are divided into two factions on this issue. One faction believes that the US dollar is more stable because it is backed by gold coins, indicating that the French franc is the weakest of the currencies of the three countries, France, the US, and the UK. Although the panic caused by the Marseilles assassination has now temporarily subsided, the future of the French government is now quite worrying, so speculators are now replenishing the pounds they have sold for safety. Another faction says that the popularity of the pound sterling is now better than before. Yesterday, there were more sellers than buyers of US dollars in the New York foreign exchange market. This situation shows that the seasonal pressure on the pound has passed. The *Financial News* said that even if the pound sterling still falls as low as in the autumn, it will lose no more than 2%. However, if there is a turnaround, the gain should be 10%. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Clarifying Future Monetary Policy</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau officially announced today that the profits earned by the government from implementing the Silver Purchase Act will not be allocated to ordinary expenses. Morgenthau also said that the Treasury Department will temporarily record this surplus in the Treasury's daily report as a special deposit, rather than as ordinary income. According to senior Treasury officials, the Secretary means that the silver surplus will also be the surplus obtained from reducing the gold content of the dollar, which will be retained by the Treasury Department as a reserve. The total amount of silver purchase surplus reported in today's Treasury report is $3,171,296, but it does not include other silver deposits in the Treasury Department. The coinage surplus of this type of silver deposit is $167,153. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Renowned economist Ayres, upon returning from a tour of Europe, declared today that leaders in European industry and finance all believe that the dollar problem is the biggest obstacle to world recovery. Ayres also said that no one in Europe approves of the government's silver purchase plan. President Roosevelt will deliver a speech at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association next Wednesday. Wall Street is paying close attention to it, as the speech may reveal the government's future monetary policy. The general impression on Wall Street is that the government has a tendency to adopt more conservative policies. Conservative newspapers in New York also hold this view, and unanimously say that the rise in securities is due to the president's shift to the right. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(New York) Federal Reserve Bank President Bullock declared here today that the dollar cannot be stabilized when the pound sterling is fluctuating.

<p>Ryojun (Port Arthur) Prime Minister Okada instructed Governor-General Hishikari by wireless, stating that he hopes to do his utmost to appease the officials of the Kwantung Leased Territory. Therefore, Governor-General Hishikari immediately moved to the Kwantung Leased Territory. The executives of the Territory are now understanding the Governor-General's intention and are cooperating with the Governor-General to appease the officials. (Den-tsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The intention of all 10,000 officials in the entire Kwantung Leased Territory to resign en masse is extremely difficult to dissuade. They will express their intention to resign within two or three days. The executives of the Kwantung Leased Territory are doing their best to persuade them to stay, but the officials' solidarity and intention to resign are very firm. The current executives are quite anxious and have no other choice but to temporarily endure and remain in their current positions, and to persuade the officials to stay. In addition, the newly established Dalian Special Affairs Agency of the Kwantung Army is deeply considering countermeasures to solve the resignation problem. (Den-tsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of Vice-Minister Tsubegami of the Colonial Ministry taking responsibility for appeasing the officials within the ministry, the hardliners including the Directors of the Third Bureau Iikoma, Kitajima, and Takayama have also suspended their resignations. However, Vice-Minister Tsubegami will resign at an appropriate time. (United Japanese Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Ryojun) The resignations of the Kwantung Leased Territory officials have been submitted to the bureau and section chiefs. Yesterday, the heads of the respective bureaus gave earnest instructions, saying that our resignation is an unavoidable move, and we sincerely hope that you will remain in your positions and complete your duties. Subsequently, the section chiefs returned the resignations. After the return of the resignations, officials below the rank of commissioned officers held an emergency meeting and decided to act jointly with the executives and submit the resignations again today or tomorrow. (Den-tsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) As the atmosphere of resolving the Kwantung situation gradually intensifies, there is suddenly a movement to withdraw the resignations of all officials in the Kwantung Leased Territory and all police officers in Manchuria. The intention is to arouse the unity of the military, civilians, and officials. Representatives from more than 50 districts in the city, backed by 300,000 Dalian citizens, convened a joint meeting of district chiefs, initiated by the chairman and vice-chairman of the association, Ozawa and Matsuda. They are scheduled to hold a temporary meeting of district chiefs at the city hall in one or two days, requesting the withdrawal of resignation letters in order to clean up the mess, and will begin their vigorous movement.

<p>Franco-Italian Compromise is Key to European Peace</p>
<p>The Trip is Scheduled After the League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources in political circles today, the diplomatic policy left by former French Foreign Minister Barthou will continue to be pursued by the new Foreign Minister Laval without any changes. Laval has no intention of canceling his trip to Rome. This trip is the key to promoting Franco-Italian and Italian-Yugoslav compromises. However, because Laval needs to personally participate in the discussion of the Saar issue in the next few days, this trip must wait until the end of November. (National News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the death of Foreign Minister Barthou, French foreign policy remains the same. The new Foreign Minister Laval has studied the files left by his predecessor, discussed them with the responsible officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and consulted with various diplomats in order to understand the actual situation of various international issues. After such discussion, consultation, and research, he has also reached a certain understanding. In short, it can be asserted that French foreign policy will not change its direction. As for approaching Italy, it is still one of the goals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The trip to Rome, which was planned by Barthou, will now be taken by Laval. It is too early to say when the trip will be scheduled. It will probably be after the middle of November, because the League of Nations Council will discuss the Saar issue at that time. Laval is paying close attention to this matter, so he will be able to travel only after the Council meeting is over. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>The Hungarian capital Prime Minister Gömbös set out for Warsaw this morning, where he will stay for three days. Before departing, he gave a talk to the press, mentioning the Marseilles assassination, saying that its results are not at all worrisome. Hungary sincerely hopes that the truth of this case will come to light as soon as possible.

<p>The Leader of the Terrorist Party Arrested</p>
<p>The Case Will Have New Developments</p>
<p>(The Hungarian capital) Political circles have recently learned that the Yugoslav embassy in Hungary has asked the Hungarian government for some information related to the Marseilles bloodshed in the usual diplomatic manner, but in order to facilitate the investigation, neither side has issued any public announcements. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Pavelić, the leader of the Croatian terrorist group "Ustaše", and his assistant Kvaternik have been arrested by the Italian police in Turin. The two do not admit to being involved in the assassination of the Southern King Alexander, but the results of today's interrogation have proved that Pavelić is indeed the leader of the "Ustaše" group and wants to achieve Croatian separation by violence. Pavelić is about 50 years old and has been sentenced to death in absentia by the Yugoslav court. After leaving the country, he traveled between Italy, Austria, and Hungary from time to time. As for Kvaternik, also known as Karamer, he is the leader of the Marseilles bloodshed murderers. At the beginning of this year, King Alexander I of the South visited Zagreb. Someone tried to assassinate him, but fortunately failed. The authorities' investigation revealed that the instigator was Mr. Kar, who spent most of his time with his sister, whose brother-in-law is a German industrialist. French police officials have sent detectives to Italy to verify the origins of the two men, Pav and Kar. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Marseilles) It is now known that Pavelić and Kvaternik were indeed living in Marseilles at the end of last month. After the two men were arrested in Turin, Italy, the police showed their photos to various hotels in Marseilles. A hotel official immediately recognized them. In addition, another arrested party member, Marni (i.e. Kraermivo), was escorted here from the city of Meulun. After being confronted by an official from a hotel in Aix, he immediately confessed that he had indeed stayed there. As for the blonde beautiful woman, Wooterlov, the police are searching for her everywhere, but she has not yet been arrested. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey Michailov, the leader of the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, i.e. the "Ohrana" Party, previously fled to this place from Bulgaria. The authorities believe that Michailov's stay here is very inconvenient, so they have transferred him to the Gastamonu area for five days. As for the final decision, it will be made within days. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>The capital of Bulgaria Prime Minister Georgiev recently issued a statement to the Yugoslav *Truth* newspaper regarding the Marseilles tragedy, saying that the Bulgarian people are outraged at the news of the tragedy. The nests of Macedonian terrorist organizations in Bulgaria have been cleared. (After the visit of the late King Alexander of the South to Bulgaria at the end of September, Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgiev ordered the dissolution of the terrorist organization "Ohrana.") The government believes that suspicions can be eliminated and good relations can be restored between Slavic peoples. Who would have thought that Macedonian terrorist Georgiev (i.e. Karlman) would take vicious action and put the Southern King to death? Before the Marseilles tragedy, the murderer had killed many Bulgarians. His party members have unpredictable intentions. We must find ways to prevent them so that the friendship between the Southern and Bulgarian nations can continue to be maintained. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>A Declaration by the French Premier</p>
<p>Opens a Path to Amicable Agreement Between the Two Nations</p>
<p>From Kaiserslautern, Germany: Special German Saar Affairs Envoy, Mr. Borchardt, stated in a speech today that French Premier Doumergue's Saar policy is contrary to the principles outlined in the memorandum of the late Foreign Minister Barthou. Therefore, it is highly beneficial to the future of friendship and cooperation between Germany and France. According to Mr. Borchardt, Mr. Doumergue's declaration has raised hopes among the general public regarding the Saar issue, and it is deeply felt that there is a possibility for Germany and France to seek peace with sincerity and openness in the future as a basis for understanding between the two countries. However, such hopes have existed between the two countries before, but disagreements have ultimately led to the hopes being shattered. Mr. Borchardt then provided a brief account of the memorandum issued by Mr. Barthou during his lifetime, and pointed out that the memorandum predicted that France would directly interfere in Germany's internal affairs after a public vote, which could significantly influence the future of the vote and allow the status quo to continue. However, Germany's view is based on the international privileges of the nation, and it has been repeatedly confirmed that all residents of the Saar region are Germans. Therefore, Germany only wants unconditional recovery of its territory. Unfortunately, this need is obstructed by French economic imperialist groups, who falsely claim that there are 150,000 French citizens in the Saar region and are trying their best to persuade French politicians to be used by them, creating a situation against the Saar's annexation to Germany. In the first year after the Saar's separation from Germany, France tried its best to entice the German citizens in the Saar region in an attempt to gain their trust. Fortunately, the people there are all patriotic and not confused by this. Now, France is thinking of taking advantage of the changes in German domestic politics and using the power of the anti-government faction to establish a minority ethnic group in the Saar region and fight for the maintenance of the status quo. This is Barthou's strategy, which is completely contrary to what Doumergue is now declaring. Mr. Borchardt then reviewed the people who support maintaining the status quo. Mr. Borchardt said that they are not at war with Germany, but with the German government. Therefore, they misunderstand the intention of the vote, taking the German political system as a prerequisite, and forgetting the Saar region's own issues. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Twenty-One Aircraft Participating</p>
<p>Took Off from England This Morning</p>
<p>Will Stop at Five Locations Along the Way</p>
<p>(London) One of the British aircraft participating in the London-Melbourne air race suffered significant damage this afternoon during a test flight at the Mildenhall airfield. The aircraft was the De Havilland Comet, piloted by Jones and Walter. After a smooth landing after the test flight, it was pushed along the ground for several yards, but suddenly the rear seemed inflexible, and the aircraft stopped moving forward. The engine was quickly shut down, and it was found that the propeller had been twisted due to contact with the ground. It was initially thought that it would not be able to participate in the race, but it is now hoped that a new propeller can be found in France before Saturday and installed on it. American woman, Ms. Cochran, one of the four women participating in the race, announced today that she will fly her Granville monoplane and set off. The participating aircraft will stop at five locations along the way: Allahabad, Singapore, Darwin, and Charleville in India. These five airfields are now exceptionally active. According to news from Allahabad, efforts are now being made to economize the time it takes for aircraft to arrive and depart. Powerful gasoline pumps have been installed that can refuel eight aircraft simultaneously. The Iraqi government has passed special legislation exempting all aircraft from customs, passport, and health regulations. According to experts, after arriving in Baghdad, the aircraft will only need to stop for 20 minutes before flying to India. According to news from Allahabad, the Indian Viceroy will observe the aircraft passing through at a certain location.</p>
<p>A lottery was held this afternoon. The famous British aviator, Morrison, and his wife, Amy Johnson, will be the first to depart from the Mildenhall airfield at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. The remaining aircraft will take off every 45 seconds. The last to depart will be the young Australian aviator, Melrose. All aircraft must be ready one hour before departure. Only a sudden fog could delay the race. Air Force officer Gilman arrived in Mildenhall at dusk, one of the last to arrive among the participants. There are a total of 21 aircraft participating in the race, some for speed racing, some for obstacle racing, and some for both. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>New York: Before the opening of the New York stock market, the favorable factors for the market were: (1) Although there were no exciting developments, the atmosphere of the stock market was reassuring. Public confidence was slightly in favor of further development, and transactions would inevitably increase rapidly. (2) It is anticipated that the copper industry will improve, as some railways are in the process of purchasing supplies. The unfavorable factors for the market were that the commodity market was not in good condition, and failed to attract buying interest in the stock market. The sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange were also a cause for unease. Stocks opened steadily this morning, with price fluctuations limited to single digits. Merchants remained cautious and expected the market to remain narrow. Everyone is currently paying attention to Washington, as the authorities have a trend of encouraging commerce.

<p>(Guihua) The finals of the Sui-produced horse show were held on the 19th. Twelve outstanding horses were selected. Chen Hansan's horse from Baotou won the championship and was named "Shuo Xiong" by the Hou Tao region association, receiving a prize of 350 yuan. Thirteen pacers were selected. Cao Shizeng's horse won the championship and was named "Bian Feng," with a time of one minute and one second. Six draught horses were selected. Cui Zhu's horse won first place and was named "Yu Lin." The origin of the winning horses was all in Sui. Each received a prize of 150 yuan. The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 PM. The next show is planned to add cattle and horse competitions. Feng Yuxiang and military and association representatives Peng Zhenguo and Chuan Zuoyi gave speeches, saying that Mongolian horses are not weaker than foreign horses and hoping that attention will be paid to horse breeding in the future.

Therefore, Gu showed off his skills against them. The audience was amazed and exclaimed him the "Little Hero of the Frontier." (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Hebei Daming Tax Police Open Fire, Killing Salt Farmers in a Bloodbath <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Death Toll Reaches as High as Thirty-Eight</p>
<p>Inspection Office Dispatches Personnel to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Eighth District Tax Office of the Changlu Salt Affairs Inspection Office, stationed in Daming, led by District Chief Yang Yi, dispatched police officers from the entire district to Zhao Gu Village in the county on the 8th of this month to destroy salt ponds. Local salt flat residents gathered to resist with weapons, leading to a conflict. Tax police opened fire on the spot, killing eighteen people and seriously injuring more than twenty. On the tax police side, one person went missing and seven were injured. After this incident occurred, the people of Daming County were quite agitated by the tax police's barbaric actions and the multiple deaths and injuries, creating a situation where the Eighth District tax police, who caused the incident, could not easily get away with it. The Changlu Salt Affairs Inspection Office considered the situation serious and specially dispatched Zhang Zhongli, Director of the Tax Police Bureau, to rush to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate and find a solution nearby. The course of events is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The sale of salt produced in the Changlu area has been sluggish recently. According to an investigation by the Salt Transportation Department, as many as seventy-three counties throughout Hebei Province are manufacturing and selling nitrate salt, affecting salt tax revenue and causing monthly losses. In recent months, only 1.8 million yuan has been collected each month. Changlu tax revenues are a source of military funding for the north, and 1.5 million yuan must be allocated to Beiping for military supplies each month. Zeng Yangfeng, the Salt Transportation Commissioner, in order to rectify the situation, first added tax police and dispatched Deputy Director Su of the Tax Police Bureau, along with tax police, to Gaoyang County, where the most nitrate salt is produced, for investigation. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Hebei Provincial Government requesting assistance in suppressing it. At 10:00 AM on the 8th of this month, the Daming Eighth District Tax Police, led by District Chief Yang Yi, went to the Zhao Gu Village nitrate salt ponds. The ponds were relied upon by hundreds of salt farmers as a source of food and clothing. Upon hearing that the tax police were coming, they gathered to resist and refused with armed force. Tax Police District Chief Yang Yi then ordered them to open fire. Initially, the one hundred and fifty tax police fired a volley into the air, intending to intimidate them, but the salt farmers did not retreat and instead charged forward. Yang then ordered them to fire a second time, killing eighteen people on the spot and seriously injuring more than twenty. The salt farmers, seeing deaths and injuries, retreated slightly. After the incident unfolded, Daming gentry and representatives of the salt farmers jointly appealed to the province, requesting that the Finance Ministry remove and punish District Chief Yang Yi, who caused the disaster by opening fire. Zeng Yangfeng, the Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner, upon receiving the report, on the one hand ordered the tax police not to act rashly, and on the other hand requested the Provincial Government to telegraph Daming County Magistrate Cheng Tinghuan to properly appease and assist in resolving the matter. According to a telegram report received by the Provincial Government from Daming County Magistrate Cheng Tinghuan, the tax police opened fire for half an hour that day, consuming more than fifteen hundred rounds of ammunition. Salt farmers were lying dead and injured everywhere, in a very tragic state. Daming legal entities, at the request of the families of the injured and dead salt farmers, have sent telegrams to the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee and the Military Sub-Committee, demanding that the perpetrators be punished. According to the person in charge of the Changlu Salt Transportation Department, the Daming tax police destroying the salt ponds was done under orders. The Transportation Department stipulated a price of three jiao for every hundred catties of nitrate salt to be purchased in full, and forbade further violations. The measures were not inadequate, but the salt farmers resisted in reliance on their numbers, which was inappropriate. It was decided to handle it according to the law. As for the fact that the tax police, in the performance of their duties, opened fire and caused deaths, the department has also decided to handle it according to the law, it was said. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Border Area to be Designated a Special Administrative Region <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Special Region Relief Association Submits to Henan Party Affairs Office</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Henan Special Region Relief Association, considering that the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui border area is mountainous and has suffered from banditry in the past, specially requested the Provincial Party Affairs Special Commissioner's Office yesterday to designate it as a special administrative region, in order to assign responsibility and eliminate the source of the chaos. The original submission from the association is recorded below: "Regarding the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui border area, with overlapping mountains and many bandits, we respectfully request that it be designated as a special administrative region in order to assign responsibility and eliminate the source of the chaos. We have investigated that the counties formerly under Ruguang in Henan are connected to Yingliu in the east and bordered by Huangma in the south. The myriad mountains intersect, and the streams and paths twist and turn, making every place a strategic point. Furthermore, they are far from the provincial capitals of each province, so if there is any trouble, it immediately becomes a situation beyond their reach. Therefore, those who plot wrongdoing seize the opportunity to cause disturbances. This can be seen throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties. However, they were all bandit natures. Once defeated, they would flee elsewhere. Only the Red Bandits have ideology and organization. The local people, through their Red influence, are difficult to move. Over the years, although they have been repeatedly encircled and suppressed by large armies, and defeat has left them unable to form an army, the remaining bandit forces rise and fall intermittently, and there has been no way to settle the aftermath. Previously, Commissioner Chen Jicheng of the Ninth District of Henan suggested to the Central Government and the Ministry that a new province be established in the border area of the three provinces to unify military and civilian affairs. The Ministry of Interior approved, saying, "The establishment of a new province in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is for the sake of pacifying the local area and facilitating administration. What has been stated is not without merit. The office should consider the local conditions and natural terrain in detail, make detailed plans, and submit three proposed province names, along with explanations of their meanings, to the ministry for further review and decision." Hearing this, we were greatly pleased, believing that once the special region was demarcated for governance, the displaced would surely return to their former occupations. However, this matter is of great importance, and the procedures are cumbersome, so it is feared that it cannot be realized in a short period of time. It is proposed that you consult the previous case submitted by Liu Zhenhua, the former commander of the three border regions for bandit suppression, and designate the counties formerly under Ruguang in Henan, the counties formerly under Yingliu in Anhui, Kongshan, Macheng, Luotian, Qishui, Huangmei in Hubei, as well as Shouchun, Fengtai, and other counties in Anhui, and set up more county governments in important places far from the county seats, to create a special administrative region in order to receive the effect of mutual assistance and to achieve the overall plan for complete elimination. In this way, the masses infected by Red influence will no longer be able to repeat their tricks of dividing the whole into parts and dividing the parts into wholes, avoiding the real and going to the virtual, making noise in the east and fleeing to the west. With no opportunity to seize, hidden dangers will naturally disappear. There is no better way to settle the aftermath than this. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Feng Yuxiang Arrives in Jinan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>To Mourn His Old Friend Gu Liangyou</p>
<p>After Boarding the Train, He Sat Among the Poor</p>
<p>Feng Talks About His Recent Life Reading in the Mountains</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Feng Yuxiang, who resides in Mount Tai, arrived quietly in Jinan this morning (the 17th) at 7:00 AM with light luggage and few attendants. It is reported that Mr. Feng received the shocking news last night (the 16th) that Gu Liangyou, Commander of the Third Route of the Shandong Militia, had passed away and was extremely saddened. He urgently wanted to come to Jinan to pay his respects in person. There were no trains heading north at that time, so he waited until about 3:00 AM this morning, in the dim starlight, and walked down the mountain. Those who came with him included the guard captain Wang Zhiyi, attendants Liu Chunde and Zu Mingfeng, and four guards. Liu Chunde and the others were initially unaware of where Feng was going when he left his residence late at night and were all worried and helpless, but they did not dare to stop him and simply followed. At 4:00 AM, they arrived at the Taian Railway Station. Two passenger trains were stopped at the station. Feng sent a follower to ask where the trains were going. After a short wait, the follower reported that the train was heading south. Feng was silent and unhappy. Soon after, another follower reported that the other train was heading north. Feng then urged them to buy eight third-class tickets. The attendants asked where to buy the tickets to, and Feng replied Jinan. At this point, Liu Chunde and the others realized that Feng was coming to Jinan to mourn a friend and were relieved. They then bought tickets and boarded the third-class passenger car. Feng sat precariously by the window in the car, while the attendants sat nearby to protect him secretly. When Feng first entered the car, most of the passengers in the car were poor people from southern Shandong going to the Northeast to make a living, supporting the old and carrying the young, wearing tattered clothes, in a very pitiful state. Seeing Feng arrive, they mostly looked at him strangely because of his height and build. An old farmer sat with Feng, nearly seventy years old. Feng looked at him and talked to him, asking where he was going. The old man replied that he was going to Tianjin to transfer to the Northeast to make a living. Feng then asked why he was leaving Guan to make a living. He replied that his family was very poor and it was difficult to make a living, so he had no choice but to leave his hometown and travel far to make a living outside the border. After talking for a long time, Feng took out the vernacular poems he had brought with him and gave them to the old man. The old man flipped through a few pages and fell asleep, while Feng read books by the window until dawn. When Feng arrived in Jinan and got off the train, the passengers in the car and the sleeping old farmer still did not know that this was Feng. Feng arrived in Jinan. Because no one knew about it in advance, no military or government officials came to the station to welcome him. Feng was still wearing a blue coarse cloth cotton trousers and jacket, black cloth cotton shoes, white cloth socks, and a coarse cloth cotton coat. After getting off the train, he walked out of the station and went straight to the municipal government. Someone who recognized Feng hurriedly reported to the municipal government by telephone. Mayor Wen Chenglie hurriedly went out to greet him and met him on the way. They went to the municipal government together to rest. At that time, provincial government advisors Ge Jinzhang and Guo Zhigang also heard the news and rushed to meet him. At around 8:00 AM, Feng, together with Wen Chenglie, Ge Jinzhang, Guo Zhigang, and others, went to Jinan Hospital to mourn Gu Liangyou. Feng saw the coffin and cried bitterly while stroking it. After much persuasion, he stopped crying and returned to the municipal government. At around 9:00 AM, Liu Xizhong, Director of the Provincial Automobile Road Bureau, Duan Yucun, Provincial Government Advisor, Zheng Jicheng, Provincial Government Counselor, and Chai Chunlin, Director of the Shandong Tax Police Bureau, successively visited Mr. Feng at the municipal government. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, was attending the Boy Scout Grand Camp outside the South Wuzimen Provincial Public Sports Field and did not arrive at the municipal government to meet Feng and have breakfast until 11:00 AM. At around 11:00 AM, after breakfast, Han returned to the provincial government, and Feng took a nap at the municipal government. At 11:30 AM, Feng boarded a special car prepared by Han and left Jinan to return to Tai.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Mr. Feng's Remarks <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>A reporter interviewed Mr. Feng at the municipal government, asking about his recent life and his thoughts on the current situation. According to Mr. Feng, "Yu and Gu Xinzhi (i.e., Gu Liangyou) were old friends for many years. After joining the army, we were together day and night, living together for more than ten years as if it were just one day, and we shared a bed for two years. Our friendship was closer than flesh and blood. Last night, I suddenly heard the shocking news and was overwhelmed with grief, so I rushed to Jinan today (the 17th) to pay my respects. I will not stay in Jinan and will return to Tai today. I will not attend the Fifth National Congress and have no thoughts on the current situation. Living in the mountains, reading and writing, I feel quite comfortable, so I have not been going elsewhere recently. In addition to continuing to work hard on poetry, books, rites, music, politics, economics, and social sciences, I often read new poetry in my spare time. The books I read in the car on the way from Tai to Jin today were selections of vernacular poems by Lu Xun, Hu Shi, Liu Bannong, Guo Moruo, and others. The spirit of new poetry can deeply describe the social state of the big bullying the small, the strong oppressing the weak, the rich suppressing the poor, and the disregard for women. As for the national spirit, national shame, and national humiliation, they should be sung with great emotion to inspire national pride. Among the poems of Shi, Bannong, and Moruo, Moruo's are the most powerful and can best represent the strong and unyielding blood of the Chinese nation. Zhao Wangyun, a rural photographer, previously created more than one hundred rural photographs, which nakedly depict rural life, the rural economy, and rural suffering and can well represent modern rural China. I wrote separate inscriptions on the photographs. Recently, Mr. Zhao traveled to the frontier, visiting Luowenyu, Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Zhangbeikou, and other places with anti-Japanese battle sites, and all were commemorated. He took photographs everywhere he went, compiling a total of one hundred and ten photographs. He previously sent them to me to write poems for them, and I have completed one hundred and six poems, with four still unfinished. I will complete them upon my return to the mountains tonight. In the past, Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and Zuo Qiuming wrote the Zuo Zhuan. Their brush strokes were critical, exposing the darkness of their time without reservation, making them the best historical records. Every time I read an article, if I felt something in my heart, I would write it down in a book. Over the years, I have collected more than one hundred articles, which I have now completed and will be published soon under the name "Reading the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Book of Rites." Recently, I have further organized my miscellaneous feelings from reading the Book of Documents and the Book of Poetry and am also preparing to compile them into a book under the name "Reading the Book of Documents, the Book of Poetry, and the Book of Rites." It will also be completed soon. I have decided to study and engage in writing in the future and will not ask about other matters. Many farmers in Taian raise silkworms, but they stick to the old methods and do not know how to improve them, so the results are not good. Previously, Mr. Cai Renbao wrote to me to discuss sending two people to Tai to provide guidance and asked me to select two farmers to go to Yidu to study silkworm breeding so that they could return to Tai to provide guidance. However, the farmers are all poor and it is difficult for them to leave home, so it did not happen. During my leisure time living in the mountains, I often walk in the mountains, look north with my head raised, and think of the four northeastern provinces that have fallen into the hands of foreigners, the beautiful rivers and mountains, the hundreds of cities, which have not yet been recovered. Tens of millions of compatriots, countless elders, brothers, aunts, and sisters, are all in deep water and fiery heat, crying and shouting, waiting for rescue. We who live in the interior, hoping and longing, cannot but be ashamed of ourselves. After the September 18th Incident, we relied on the League of Nations today and the League of Nations tomorrow. As of today, the League of Nations investigation team has long since returned east, and there is no solution. Furthermore, our country's seat on the League of Nations Council has been lost. The League of Nations' attitude towards China is clear. If the Chinese people do not rise up and struggle, it will be difficult to imagine the future. Batches of overseas Chinese residing in Japan are being deported back to the country, while the arrival of Asahi Shimbun airplanes in Tianjin is being celebrated on a grand scale. I wonder what the Chinese people think of this. As of today, the state of the nation is such that if the Chinese people do not wake up, unite sincerely, and resist foreign aggression together to overcome the difficulties of the time, there will be a danger of national subjugation. I sincerely hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will understand this intention and rise up to save the country. There is still a glimmer of hope for the future of the nation," he said.

<h3 id="e102">Gansu Province Education Situation <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, education in Gansu Province has suffered from financial constraints, barely maintaining the status quo. Objectively, the number of schools has been increasing annually, but the facilities remain rudimentary. Few middle school graduates have the means to pursue further education, leading to a significant shortage of specialized talent. Furthermore, most county middle schools are headed by local gentry, resulting in uneven educational development across the counties.</p>
<p>In the provincial capital, school education is relatively developed. Higher education includes one Gansu College, divided into university and high school departments. The university department is further divided into four departments: law, medicine, literature, and agriculture, plus a special studies department. The high school department is divided into three levels. The total number of students in the college is over 250, with monthly expenses of 7,353,000 yuan. Secondary education includes the First Normal School, divided into higher and lower levels, with one normal class, six junior high classes, and eight attached elementary classes, totaling over 400 students (excluding the attached elementary school), with monthly expenses of 5,085,650 yuan. The First Middle School is divided into higher and lower levels, with six junior high classes and two senior high classes, totaling over 500 students, with monthly expenses of 4,739,800 yuan. The First Agricultural School has three general science classes, totaling over 160 students, with monthly expenses of 3,690,650 yuan. The Fifth Middle School has five junior high classes and six attached elementary classes, totaling over 140 students (excluding the attached elementary school), with monthly expenses of 2,511,970 yuan. The First Industrial School has three general science classes, totaling over 110 students, with monthly expenses of 3,690,650 yuan. The First Women's Normal School has one senior high normal class, four junior high classes, one kindergarten normal class, one vocational class, six attached elementary classes, and two kindergarten groups, totaling over 120 students (excluding the attached elementary school and kindergarten), with monthly expenses of 3,670,560 yuan.</p>
<p>The total monthly expenses for the above seven middle and high schools are 30,742.28 yuan. Divided among over 1,520 students, the monthly expense per student is over 20 yuan, excluding equipment costs. In addition to tuition and book fees, the total expense per middle and high school graduate over their years of study is over 1,400 yuan. If graduates have no avenues for engaging in social production after graduation, both society and the graduates will suffer adverse effects. Is this the true intention of education?</p>
<p>Educational administration in the province: (A) Higher education: changing domestic study fees to scholarships. In the past, the Education Department, aiming to cultivate specialized talent, set aside provincial-funded quotas at various domestic universities, colleges, and vocational schools. However, few provincial-funded students were able to enter national universities, while many entered private universities. Few were able to enter science and technology departments, while many entered social science departments, resulting in the education received not meeting the needs of the province. To correct this problem, the Education Department specifically changed domestic student fees to scholarships, providing provincial funding based on academic merit to increase learning efficiency. (B) Secondary education: issuing a general order for all secondary schools to add Tibetan language instruction and instructing the Fifth Middle School to establish special Mongolian-Tibetan classes. The Education Department previously received an order from the Ministry of Education approving the addition of Mongolian and Tibetan languages to the foreign language curriculum of secondary schools. Therefore, the Education Department, in addition to ordering the provincial Fifth Middle School to actively plan for the establishment of special Mongolian-Tibetan classes, also ordered all county-level middle schools to add Tibetan language instruction, using education as a means to develop the Northwest and promote culture. (C) Elementary education: the most important administrative task at present is to restore the closed elementary schools at all levels in the counties. Due to years of water and drought disasters, educational funding in the counties is on the verge of bankruptcy, resulting in the closure of many elementary schools at all levels. Elementary education is the foundation of all education, and rapid restoration is urgently needed. The current Education Department has already ordered the county education bureaus to strictly follow the restoration measures. (D) Social education: establishing public education centers and social education promotion offices. The establishment of public education centers requires enormous funding, so the Education Department plans to request the provincial government to transfer the Gansu Provincial Education Hall to the Education Department and convert it into a public education center. In addition, the Education Department has also established three social education promotion offices, each with propaganda, investigation, and sports divisions, with monthly expenses of 243 yuan. An additional 50 yuan per month has been added to establish reading rooms with books and newspapers. (E) Education funding: allocating all Gansu cigarette special taxes as education subsidies. The middle and high schools in the provincial capital require monthly expenses of over 30,000 yuan. The temporary maintenance meeting decided to allocate all income from the Gansu Transportation Bureau as special funds for these schools. After the reorganization and establishment of the provincial government, coinciding with the off-season, it was difficult to ensure sufficient special funds. Moreover, the county middle schools were owed a large amount, including arrears from the previous year and the first half of the 21st year. To maintain the current state of education in the province, the Education Department proposed to the provincial government to approve the allocation of income from the cigarette special tax bureau as education funding to assist. The Department also jointly formulated three measures with the Finance Department to guarantee this special education fund, which were approved and implemented by the provincial conference. As a result, Gansu's education funding, which had been relying on years of accumulated deficits, finally had reliable funds to maintain operations. If increased equipment funds are allocated to schools at all levels, regular expenses are reduced, and teacher salaries are increased, the future of education in Gansu will be promising.</p>
<p>Since taking office in the 21st year, the Director of the Education Department, Shui Chuqin, has strived to improve educational facilities to the best of his ability, even while maintaining the status quo. As a result, achievements have been made daily, and his reputation is quite good. It is said that Gansu Province has a complex ethnic composition, and the people have historically not valued reading. Before the founding of the Republic, the Hui and Tibetan ethnic groups absolutely prohibited their children from attending school. In recent years, Hui Muslim leaders have begun to advocate for education, but the number of Tibetan people who know how to read remains very small. The so-called development of the Northwest, whether in terms of water conservancy, transportation, farmland, mineral resources, or culture, cannot be achieved without first having detailed plans to seek equitable development. In terms of education, it is necessary to enrich and improve existing regular schools. However, without establishing special methods to educate and raise the cultural level of the majority of Hui and Tibetan compatriots, it is impossible to achieve the desired results. Fortunately, Hui and Tibetan leaders strongly support this, either by establishing separate Hui and Tibetan schools or by attaching special classes to various schools. However, due to continuous disasters and economic hardship in various regions, development and construction in any aspect cannot be effective without the strong support of the central government and people from the southeast.</p>
<p>In Gansu Province, the news media was only known to a few intellectuals around the end of the Guangxu era in the Qing Dynasty. After the founding of the Republic, the Kuomintang first published the Dahe Daily in Lanzhou. At the same time, the Republican Party also published the Lanzhou Daily, but both were subsequently discontinued. Between the fifth and sixth years of the Republic, the "Hesheng" and "Longyou Public Report" were published, but they were only fleeting. In the seventh year of the Republic, the Biansheng Weekly was published, aiming to harmonize the opinions of the Han and Hui ethnic groups, but it was discontinued after a year due to financial difficulties. In the fourteenth and fifteenth years, the National Revolutionary Army entered Gansu, and the Xinlong Daily and the Republic Daily, sponsored by the provincial party headquarters, were published. The Xinlong Daily was discontinued in the eighteenth year, but the Republic Daily continues to this day. Since the twentieth year, there has been a sudden surge in development, with newspapers and news agencies springing up like mushrooms after rain. There are four types of daily newspapers: Republic Daily, Northwest Daily, Xinlong Daily, and Longnan Minsheng Daily. There are two types of daily publications: Wuliang Voice and Wulan Daily. There are seven types of weekly publications: Huiguang Weekly, Bianguan Weekly, Longxi Minsheng, Hexi Weekly, Ganzhou Minsheng, Minyan Bao, and Heyang Weekly. There are twelve types of news agencies: Minjian News, Minyu News, Zhengwen News, Linxia News, Wuyang News, Hangdian News, Xingmin News, Jingtai News, Rural News, Xihe News, Sanlong News, and Bianwen News. In addition, there are publications from various agencies and schools, with numerous titles too numerous to list. However, they all make their respective contributions to social culture.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce Requests Revision of Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce believes that the stamp tax law compiled by the Legislative Yuan goes against commercial practices. Therefore, they telegraphed Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, requesting a revision. The message stated, in brief (greetings omitted): "Recently, we read in the newspaper that the stamp tax law only benefits those below three yuan, and those above three yuan are subject to progressive taxation, causing extreme harassment to merchants. Moreover, those who are not familiar with the law are at risk of being fined. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and commerce is in decline, merchants are already unable to bear the burden. We urge the President to consider the difficulties of merchants, comply with public opinion, and approve revisions to alleviate the merchants' hardships."</p>

<p>In a thatched shed near Xinglong Bridge outside the East Gate of Wuxi, near the Ye Qin Yarn Factory, lived Tang Kun, a 32-year-old Yixing native, who made a living by rowing Changzhou fast boats. His wife, Zhou, was somewhat attractive and worked as a female worker in the Ye Qin Yarn Factory. She recently became acquainted with Yuan Fuchang, a Taizhou native who worked as a leather craftsman nearby. Around 8 PM the previous night, Yuan sneaked into Tang's house again to rekindle their affair. As they were being intimate, Tang suddenly returned home and was furious. He punched and kicked Fuchang, giving him a beating. After neighbors intervened, Fuchang fled. However, not long after Fuchang left, several uninvited guests suddenly arrived at Tang's house and forcibly dragged Kun out. Yuan Fuchang was also waiting outside and together they dragged Tang Kun to a deserted area across the river from the Jiatai Silk Factory. There, Fuchang used an axe to strike Kun twice on the back of his neck and the left side of his head, causing blood to flow profusely. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, fled. Kun, despite his injuries, pursued them. Near the Longchang Silk Factory, the assailant Yuan Fuchang was captured by people from the workshop and handed over to the police, who took him to the First Precinct of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and detention. The other assailants escaped. Tang was rushed to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, but due to the fractured skull, his survival is doubtful.</p>

<p>The Yongsheng Rice Store in Sanli Bridge, Beiting, was jointly opened by Wu Yunxi, Wu Yaoting, and Feng Haoxi, and has been in business for nearly ten years. Feng Haoxi served as manager, and the business was thriving. The store's accountant, Zhu Zhongming, in his twenties, was usually cautious in his work. However, he was addicted to gambling and liked to frequent prostitutes, leading him to embezzle over 300 yuan from the store. Recently, he had a sudden idea and, at 9 AM yesterday, withdrew 5,000 yuan in cash from the Xingye Bank, with which the store regularly did business, and fled. After manager Feng Haoxi noticed, he sent people to various places, including Beijing, Shanghai, Wucheng, to search for him, but so far there has been no news of him.</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Government sent Shi Ziquan, chief of the third section, to the province the day before yesterday to meet with Shen Baixian, Director of the Construction Department. He stated that the disaster victims in the four rural areas of the county were suffering from hunger and cold, and it was urgently necessary to organize work relief to dredge the river, which could help some of the disaster victims. He requested that funds be allocated immediately for the organization. The Department stated that the funds for work relief to dredge the river were only 400,000 yuan and had to be distributed among 36 counties. With too few resources for too many monks, the documents requesting funds from various counties have not yet been approved. Director Shen promised that the funds could be distributed to various counties after Director Zhao returned to the province. However, for Wujin, the Department could allocate at least 40,000 yuan to be effective. After Section Chief Shi returned to Chang, he began to organize work relief to dredge the river starting yesterday (the 18th). It is planned to first selectively dredge the northern section of Baihe, Tongzi, and Sanshan Port, as well as the Zhi Canal. Technicians Jiang Tong and Yu Mengyin were sent to the above rivers to survey and design. Work is expected to begin in early next month.</p>

<p>The Jiaxing Local Bank branch is also in charge of the county treasury and issues banknotes, which are not small in number. Recently, after the He Di Three Qian Zhuang and one bank successively announced liquidation, outsiders suddenly made various rumors, causing a run on the bank's banknotes starting in the afternoon of the 18th, which was even more severe on the 19th. Fortunately, the bank was well-prepared, and those who presented banknotes for redemption were given cash. Therefore, the redemption was scarce in the afternoon. Merchants in the market also continued to accept the banknotes as usual. The county government also issued a notice on the 19th, ordering the bank to prepare sufficient cash to continue redemption and ordering tax collectors to continue accepting the banknotes.</p>

<p>Losses Estimated at Around 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance increased the silver export tax, the price of marker gold has soared daily. A large number of speculators in the financial market have suffered huge losses. Therefore, the De Kang Gold Shop at No. 69 Jiujiang Road suddenly collapsed yesterday. Fortunately, the shop acted as an agent for customers in the gold exchange, so the impact on other parties was small. Xin Ruikang, the owner of the shop, stated that the losses were estimated at around 20,000 yuan. The reason for the collapse was entirely due to the sudden surge in the price of marker gold on the 17th and 18th, causing the margin to be unpayable. The notice issued by the Gold Exchange is recorded as follows: (1) De Kang Gold Shop has not cleared its margin and should be temporarily suspended from business. This notice is issued. (2) De Kang Gold Shop has now been temporarily suspended from business. As of the close of the market on the 18th, there were still seven marker gold short positions. The Exchange has designated Fu Tai Xiang Gold Shop to settle them today in accordance with the rules of business. This notice is issued.</p>
<h3 id="e121">International Trade Bureau Informs Chamber of Commerce of Tax Reduction on Silk Exports to England <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "According to Instruction No. 28251 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted that the Consulate General in Liverpool has reported that the French government suddenly reduced the number of English coal imports at the beginning of February of this year, and England immediately increased tariffs on French goods. The French government, motivated by domestic tension, considered abolishing the commercial treaties signed between England and France in 1826 and 1822. A new treaty has now been negotiated and will take effect on July 1st. Until April 1st of next year, during this period, the number of English coal shipments to France will be fully restored, and the 20% increase in tariffs on French goods to England will also be cancelled. At the same time, England will reduce tariffs on silk, rayon, vegetables, and other items. The tariff on silk has now been reduced, and China can enjoy the same treatment under the most-favored-nation clause. The three copies of the English-French commercial treaty, the abolition of the old treaty, and the three copies of the exchange of letters are attached for reference. Please forward them to the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. The relevant items are attached and sent to your Ministry to be forwarded to the chambers of commerce in various places to pay attention to the reduction of tax rates enjoyed by Chinese silk imported into England and French silk. This order, etc., is issued. Accordingly, the tax rate schedule in the commercial treaty is translated into Chinese and attached to this letter for reference. Please forward it so that everyone can pay attention." The Silk Tariff section of the first part of the tax rate schedule is excerpted below: (1) Silk cocoons and waste silk, not bleached, six pence per hundredweight if wholly or partly bleached (excluding short-fiber waste silk); short-fiber waste silk, six pence. (2) Raw silk, not bleached, one shilling six pence; wholly or partly bleached, two shillings two pence. (3) Silk yarn, not bleached, two shillings two pence; wholly or partly bleached (excluding spun silk), two shillings nine pence; spun silk, nine pence.</p>
<h3 id="e122">City Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Executive Yuan Requesting Postponement of New Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The law violates the principles determined by the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>Please revise it carefully to reduce the burden on merchants.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: Regarding the draft stamp tax law prepared by the Legislative Yuan, it has been reported that it was passed by the 73rd Yuan meeting on October 12th. Article 16 stipulates the documents subject to stamp tax and the tax rates. Among them, (1) delivery notes, (2) receipts for money and goods, and (3) bills are all subject to a stamp tax of one cent for each amount of three yuan or more but less than ten yuan, and an additional stamp tax of one cent for each additional ten yuan, but with a maximum limit of one yuan. According to the current stamp tax regulations, Article 2 stipulates that delivery notes are subject to a stamp tax of one cent regardless of the amount, and money receipts are subject to one cent for less than ten yuan and two cents for ten yuan or more. Comparing the new tax law with the current regulations, the maximum tax amount for delivery notes has increased by 100 times, and the tax amount for receipts has increased by 50 times. The bill item is not included in the current regulations. It is true that merchants have already clearly stated the payable invoices in the invoices when selling goods. Except for hotels and restaurants, there are no independent bills. Now, a new item is also established, and stamp tax is added according to the amount up to one yuan. All of these are where the new tax law is heavier than the current regulations, but it is inappropriate in terms of reason, commercial affairs, and situation. The Central Political Council is the highest political authority and has the power to create and formulate. Therefore, whenever a law is drafted, the Central Political Council first formulates legislative principles and hands them over to the Legislative Yuan to draft detailed articles. It is clear that the Legislative Yuan should not have contrary provisions to the legislative principles formulated by the Central Political Council. According to Article 5 of the stamp tax law principles formulated by the Central Political Council last year, those with more significant evidence of validity or rights, or those used for a long time, should be taxed heavily, while those with less significant evidence of validity or rights, or those used for a short time, should be taxed lightly. Article 6 states that documents for frequent behaviors should mostly adopt a simple and easy fixed-amount tax, and documents for rare behaviors should mostly adopt an easy-to-calculate progressive tax. Delivery notes, bills, and receipts are the most common documents for merchants and are daily behaviors, which are completely different from the subletting documents, stock certificates, joint venture business documents, and corporate bond tickets listed in the appendix to the law, which are documents for rare behaviors. Now, progressive tax is also levied on documents for common behaviors, the same as subletting documents, etc., which violates the principles formulated by the Central Political Council. Also, if the goods and payments for invoices, receipts, bills, etc. are settled immediately, the time of validity of the documents is extremely short. In addition, those who settle accounts at the end of the month, whether it is a large or small month, have a validity of only half a month or a month. Those who settle accounts at the end of the year have a validity of only three festivals, which is completely different from the significance and long validity of the rights of subletting documents, stock certificates, and joint venture business documents. Now, the tax amount is increased by 50 times or 100 times compared with the current regulations, which is disproportionate and violates the principles formulated by the Central Political Council. In addition to the fact that the affiliated association had previously telegraphed the Central Political Council on the 12th of this month to request correction, Article 24 of the association states that the date of implementation of this law shall be determined by order. Before the Central Political Council corrects this tax law based on the stamp tax law principles formulated last year, we would like to request your Yuan to submit it to the National Government for temporary non-promulgation and implementation by order, so that it can be revised carefully. This matter is related to maintaining the principles of national legislation and reducing the undue burden on merchants, and is of utmost urgency. We respectfully submit it to the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that China's postal savings and remittance business is still in its infancy, and that there is a particular lack of specialized talent, has decided to dispatch six students, Wang Dizhong, Chen Jiajun, Dong Xijin, Zhang Qirong, Wang Zishuang, and others, to Austria for study in order to strive for development. All departure procedures have been properly handled by the Ministry, and they are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st of this month (tomorrow) for a period of two years, so that they can return to the country to serve after completing their studies in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Part of American Journalists Group Returns Home This Morning <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>

<h3 id="e125">Unemployed Overseas Chinese from the Netherlands Transported by Hai Yuan Ship <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Approved to arrive in Shanghai on November 2nd</p>
<p>The first Hai Yuan ship newly built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company set sail from England on September 14th. According to the speed of the ship, it could reach Shanghai in 35 days. Now, when departing from England, the Chinese Embassy in England received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In recent years, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands have suffered from the global commercial depression. Those who stay in various places in the Netherlands have not only lost their ability to do business, but the Dutch authorities have also restricted the entry of overseas Chinese due to the increasing number of unemployed in the country. Those who have already been engaged in business and work in the country have been subjected to even stricter crackdowns, resulting in all the overseas Chinese stranded in the Netherlands having their livelihoods cut off and being unable to return to their country. They have asked the envoys and consuls stationed in the country to telegraph the central government to find ways to provide relief. The central government immediately ordered the Ministry of Communications to inform Wu Daming, the commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stationed in England for supervising the construction of new ships, and to notify the embassy stationed in England to order him to go to the Netherlands to carry this large group of overseas Chinese back to China when the first new Hai Yuan ship built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in England returns to China. However, when Hai Yuan left England, it did not report this intention to the bureau in a telegram. After departing from London, it went to the Netherlands to load this large group of expelled unemployed overseas Chinese and return to their country. The bureau was deeply worried about the delay in the arrival of the Hai Yuan ship because it did not know about this matter. Fang Ziwei of the Radio Station once telegraphed all the Hai Yuan ships of the bureau near Hong Kong to call out. Because the short wave could not reach Shanghai directly. There was no response the first time. It was not until the second time that it was called. The Hai Yuan ship had already gone from England to the Netherlands. After carrying a large number of overseas Chinese, it sailed along the Indian Ocean. Yesterday, the Hai Yuan ship had telegraphed Shanghai, saying, "This ship has now reached 89 degrees 15 minutes east longitude and 5 degrees 50 minutes north latitude. If there are no major storms along the way, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on November 2nd with overseas Chinese living in the Netherlands." After receiving the telegram, the bureau's shipping department had prepared to send a telegram to Hong Kong when the ship arrives, asking for the exact date of import to Shanghai, so that the bureau could send a pilot to Tongsha to lead the new ship to Jinliyuan Wharf to dock. Because the Hai Yuan has a definite date of arrival in Shanghai, Liu Hongsheng telegraphed the Ministry of Communications yesterday to ask what name to use for the new ship to entertain people from all walks of life to visit. Soon, he received a reply from the Ministry, saying that the Hai Yuan's arrival in Shanghai for entertainment should be approved in the name of the Ministry of Communications. Minister Zhu will also come to Shanghai to preside over the event. The Ministry of Communications also notified the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the date of arrival of the Hai Yuan ship that rescued the Dutch overseas Chinese and asked it to send personnel to Jinliyuan Wharf at that time to take care of everything.</p>
<h3 id="e126">City Federation Appeals to the Government to Protest Japan's Expulsion of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Please order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a strong protest</p>
<p>Urge the Japanese government to stop it to maintain justice</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation telegraphed Chairman Lin of the National Government yesterday, saying: Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Greetings. Recently, overseas Chinese in Japan have been expelled from the country by the Japanese authorities for no reason from time to time. All their property has been confiscated. Even the remaining travel expenses have been confiscated by the Japanese police, causing the overseas Chinese to suffer infinite pain and only be able to return to their country alone. Even on the ship, they are subjected to increased abuse, which is outrageous to hear. All countries trade with each other, and they all attach importance to friendly relations. Overseas Chinese from all countries in China are treated equally and protected with all our efforts. Today, Japan is using tyrannical means to treat our overseas Chinese, regardless of international justice, which is the worst. We should ask your government to order the foreign affairs authorities to file a strong protest, urging the Japanese government to awaken, or to protect overseas Chinese and prevent the above-mentioned incidents from happening again in the future, so as to strengthen friendly relations and maintain justice. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e127">After the Increased Export Tax on Silver, Gu Xinyi Discusses the Market Situation of Miscellaneous Grains <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Wheat flour prices rise, the exchange pursues margin payments</p>
<p>Domestic agricultural products sell well, and farmers benefit</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance announced the increase in export tax on silver, the market situation of various goods transactions in this city has shown a sharp increase. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Miscellaneous Grains Association of this city, to inquire about the market situation of miscellaneous grains. According to the interview as follows:</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Prices Rise According to Gu, the market prices of miscellaneous grains and flour in this city have shown a decline since autumn, and foreign goods have taken advantage of the opportunity to dump them, and there is even a possibility of a complete collapse. However, since the Ministry of Finance announced the increase in export tax on silver due to the recent sharp increase in the number of silver exports from China, the number of silver exports itself can be reduced. Foreign goods are affected by this, and market prices increase. For example, for wheat, there were originally sales from countries such as Canada to China. Assuming the original price was two yuan, but after the export tax on silver is levied, the price must also be increased at the same time. Therefore, the domestic market price has also increased.</p>
<p>Pursuing Margin Payments In recent days, the price of various commodities in the market has risen sharply. Therefore, the exchanges also need to increase the payment of margin. It has now been decided that the margin payable for every 1,000 bags of wheat will be increased to 500 yuan, and the margin payable for every 500 dan of flour will be increased to 400 yuan. Now, the short position margin is being pursued, and bidding has been temporarily suspended. After all the short position margin has been paid, bidding will be reopened.</p>
<p>Prices Looking High Gu also said that, according to the current situation, the prices of various commodities still have a tendency to continue to rise. The government also plans to levy a balancing tax after the export tax. Now, a balancing committee is about to be established in this city. After converting the London silver market price and the local market price, the difference will be used to levy the balancing tax, so that the silver export price in this city is equal to the London market price. Therefore, after the balancing tax on silver is increased, the prices of various commodities will continue to rise.</p>
<p>Farmers Benefit Gu concluded that this time, the government resolutely levied export tax and balancing tax on silver, so that the prices of various commodities can increase. Merchants deeply sympathize with the government's move. In rural areas, the prices of various agricultural products have also increased, so foreign goods can be resisted from entering, and domestic agricultural products can be sold well. Therefore, farmers can also benefit a lot in their lives. Now that it has just been implemented, there will inevitably be slight fluctuations in the market, but it will soon be stable.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The First Batch of Shaanxi Cotton Will Be Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Quality is higher than before</p>
<p>According to news from the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Commission yesterday, the cotton production in Shaanxi Province has greatly improved after the province has made great efforts to promote it. New cotton has now entered the harvest season. The Cotton Production, Transportation, and Sales Cooperative, guided by the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute, specially sent a letter to the Cotton Control Committee requesting that five experienced cotton graders be sent to the province to carry out cotton grading work. There are currently sixteen cotton production, transportation, and sales cooperatives in Shaanxi, distributed in Sanyuan, Jingyang, Weinan, Huazhou, and other counties, which are famous for cotton production, with a total of about 200,000 mu of cotton fields, with an estimated cotton production of about 50,000 dan. The cotton graders sent by the Cotton Control Committee will be assigned to work in the above-mentioned areas. Before the cotton is packed, the grades will be determined and identified, and the grade level and length will be noted on the package, and then it will be directly transported and sold for the convenience of various yarn factories to purchase. According to a recent letter from the graders to the cooperative, the cotton grade level and length are about between medium and high grade, and the length is about from 13/16 to 15/16 inches. Therefore, the quality is higher than that produced in previous years. It is heard that the first batch of graded cotton will be shipped to Shanghai soon, and it is predictable that it will be welcomed by various yarn factories. In addition, the Central Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Institute, which is affiliated to the committee, received a communication from the Shaan County branch of the Henan Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Institute yesterday, saying that the Shaan County branch of the Henan Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Institute recently discovered a batch of cotton adulterated with water and impurities and a water gun in a packaging factory. They were sent to the Commissioner's Office for investigation and handling according to law. It is heard that the case was sentenced to three months in prison and fined 800 yuan as a warning.</p>

<p>Both parties agreed to sign a new contract</p>
<p>According to Shiye News Agency, the Great China Rubber Factory in this city, since the labor dispute occurred, has been mediated by party and government agencies and various groups, and the Social Affairs Bureau has advised it to resume work as soon as possible. The factory, in consideration of the majority of good workers, convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors the day before yesterday and decided to resume work yesterday. All 1,300 good workers have entered the factory to work yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel such as Tan Peiyan to the site to supervise. The two parties signed a new labor-capital contract, and the factory also gave appropriate subsidies to the piece-rate workers. Both parties considered it satisfactory and signed it with the consent of the Social Affairs Bureau representative, and then resumed work as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Jiangsu Stamp Tax Sub-bureaus Jointly Petition to Return the Remaining Stamps <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the order to abolish and replace the stamp tax tickets, the local sub-bureaus have been unable to sell the stamps they have been claiming on a monthly basis, because there are already too many stamps in the business community, and there is no way out at all. However, the original order of the Ministry of Finance states that "all the stamp tax tickets that have been claimed but not sold by the bureau and its subordinates should be compiled into a clear list and submitted to the Ministry." It is generally believed that the remaining stamps can be returned after the end, and the capital can be recovered. However, the provincial bureau submitted a report to the Ministry, and then added restrictions, only allowing those who claimed in October to return them. In fact, in these consecutive off-seasons, very few sub-bureaus in various places have claimed as late as August and September, let alone October. The above-mentioned restrictive measures are tantamount to declaring that the sub-bureaus are not allowed to return the remaining stamps. Therefore, the sub-bureaus, with the same environment and accumulating remaining stamps, were all panicked and exchanged letters and telegrams to discuss relief measures. Recently, a joint office of sub-bureaus across the province was organized at No. 61, Lane 576, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. Recently, the heads of the sub-bureaus gathered in Shanghai for a meeting. Everyone believed that the sub-bureaus in this province were all appointment-based and did not contain the nature of a contractor who recognized the amount and contracted sales, and did not bear any liability for compensation at all. Moreover, the cancellation was at the beginning of the peak season, which prevented the sub-bureaus from adjusting the surplus to make up for the expenses. Forcing them to compensate for the sales of the remaining stamps was too harsh. On the spot, Xi Yin Shi Ruiting, Nantong Ge Songting, Wu County Xie Zuxi, and Nan Fengchuan Ma Haishan were elected as representatives of the entire group to petition the provincial bureau, requesting to return the remaining stamps, reissue the expenses, and request severance pay as an example. At the same time, it was resolved that the transfer would not be made until the goal was achieved, and further petitions would be made.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Banks Have Paid Up Savings Guarantee Securities <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In order to implement the bank savings law, the Ministry of Finance ordered all banks to organize a savings deposit guarantee reserve management committee, and ordered all banks to deposit one-quarter of the savings in various securities with the Central Bank for safekeeping, in order to protect the interests of depositors. It is now known that all banks have paid up this guarantee certificate, with a total amount of approximately 80 million yuan. However, some of the securities, etc., that have been paid in are still under review by the management committee. It is also known that the committee will notify each bank to make up for the securities at any time when the market price of the securities fluctuates, and vice versa, but the amount of the change is at least five yuan, so as to avoid the trouble of small refunds. Also, if the total amount of savings in each bank changes, it will be increased or decreased every six months according to the accounts of each bank.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Draft Measures to Compel the Industry to Join the Guild</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its third plenary committee meeting on the 18th. The committee members present were Li Wenjie, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Xiaowen, Wang Xiaotong, Xi Yushu, Sun Xiaolou, Xu Yongzuo, Cao Zhigong, Zhang Zhengxue (substituting for Xu Yongzuo), Pan Xulun, Xie Chunpu (substituting for Li Wenjie), and other ten people. The meeting was chaired by the standing committee members Fang Jiaobo and Li Wenjie to discuss the following matters: (1) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting to formulate sanctions against industrial and commercial companies and firms that do not join the same trade association, in order to petition the central government to include them in the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Trade Association Law. First, Li Wenjie reported on the process of handling the case by the committee and the content obtained from reviewing the files over the years. It was resolved that, after investigating the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, it originally took the principle that members could join the association at will. The Legislative Yuan changed the word "may" in Article 7 of the law to "shall." The sanctions against non-members were not included in the article, so that the meaning of the law and the text of the law could not be matched. The spirit of the compulsory membership system could not be fully utilized. In addition, such as the implementation rules of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, the articles of association of various trade associations, and the regulations of various industries, many of the provisions are not compatible with the current meaning of the law, and it is necessary to plan for them as a whole. Therefore, (A) the committee should send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to collect the regulations of each industry and the articles of association of each trade association and send them to the committee. (B) Sun Xiaolou, Xi Yushu, Cao Zhigong, and Li Wenjie were appointed to formulate a number of effective measures to compel the industry to join the association based on the information. (C) All committee members will be notified again to express their opinions within a certain period. (D) Finally, the standing committee members will synthesize the opinions of all parties and formulate a specific plan to respond to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter from Executive Committee Member Xiao Die to Standing Committee Member Zheqing Chen, which should be studied together. It was resolved that Chen's opinion did not involve the scope of legal research, so the results of the factual research should be added to the opinion and responded to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (A) It should be handled by the organization section of the Commercial Affairs Department. (B) It is in line with the provisions of Article 10 of the Implementation Rules of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, and the organization section of the Commercial Affairs Department should also pay attention to it. (C) It is absolutely impossible to send the industry regulations to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. (D) Omitted. (E) This is the responsibility of the product display center. (3) Committee Member Li Wenjie proposed that the Shanghai Lawyers Association petitioned the government to abolish the Shanghai Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules. After investigating that the Land Bureau is the land administration agency of this city, and the land registry and measurement map data of this city are all in the hands of the bureau, there are places where the mortgage registration of real estate must be demanded from the Land Bureau in particular. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce should petition the Ministry of Justice to pay attention to the characteristics of the land practice certificate in this city. Except for the part of the real estate mortgage registration rules that conflict with the provisions of the Civil Law, the court and the Land Bureau should still be responsible for cooperating in handling real estate rights registration matters before the Land Law is implemented. (Resolved) Passed, and responded to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Photographic Record of the Drought Disaster in Huzhou <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Disaster area covers six counties</p>
<p>Nearly one million disaster victims</p>
<p>Huzhou has always been known as a rich area, but due to years of disasters, the silk industry has plummeted, and the livelihood of farmers has been on the verge of collapse. This year, it has also encountered a strange drought, and the fields in the four villages have become barren. Even if there is a lucky harvest, the wages for bailing water are too high, and it is not worth the loss. Now, wailing is everywhere, and the hungry are waiting to be fed. The local public funds of each county have long been embezzled. Although there is a desire for relief, there is a lack of magic. They can only telegraph the disaster situation to the outside world and ask for relief. In recent days, the Huzhou Relief Committee in this city has received telegrams from various groups in the six counties of Huzhou requesting relief, which are like snowflakes flying in. The committee is concerned about its hometown and has a sense of justice. On the one hand, it distributes donation booklets and strives to raise donations. On the other hand, it appeals to the Zhejiang authorities for relief. The day before yesterday, Tian Xin, the deputy director of the committee, was selected to attend the Zhejiang Relief Meeting in Hangzhou and returned two days ago. According to him, the provincial government has agreed with the banking group to borrow 600,000 yuan for relief funds for distribution. However, there are more than 60 counties in Zhejiang Province, and the disaster situation is generally very serious. The small amount of funds seems difficult to help. Therefore, after Shen reported on the situation of attending the meeting, he is now trying to raise more donations in order to prevent the people of his hometown from becoming displaced. Now, the disaster situation in the six counties of Huzhou has been investigated and recorded as follows: (Wuxing) The total area of cultivated land in the county is 2,089,000 mu, and the disaster area is 627,000 mu, accounting for 30% of the total.</p>
<p>(Disaster situation (Severe drought for months, branches and ports have become streams, uncultivated fields have been turned into stones, and most of the cultivated rice has turned yellow and withered. Even if there is a slight harvest, it is not worth the loss due to the excessive wages for bailing water. There are more than 300,000 disaster victims, who are filling their stomachs with water chestnut seedlings and taro stems. Some have even committed suicide in anger because they have nothing to eat, or have forcibly grabbed food and touched the criminal law. There have been many cases. (Changxing) The total area of cultivated land in the county is 1,343,000 mu, and the disaster area is 873,000 mu, accounting for 65% of the total. (Disaster situation) The county borders the mountains and the lake. Mountain fields cannot be bailed for relief and have become barren. At first, the lake fields tried hard to pump water, not hesitating to pawn and borrow to pay for wages. Then, the river and port were dry, and pumping for relief was impossible. Taihu Building Port is either blocked and impassable, or the mouth is deep and wide and cannot be stored. Although there is a vast ocean, it cannot be used, and the fields and rice are watched to wither. Moreover, because there was water to pump at the beginning, pawning and borrowing was done in order to save it. The pain of the disaster area near the lake is even greater. There are now more than 200,000 disaster victims, who are scrambling for grass roots and bark to fill their stomachs, and selling their daughters in the market to exchange for liters of rice. (Deqing) The total area of cultivated land in the county is 549,000 mu, and the disaster area is 357,000 mu, accounting for 65% of the total. (Disaster situation) There is no way to sow uncultivated fields, and the rice that has been planted has withered. Although efforts have been made to pump water for relief, it is impossible to limit the height and position of the land, and the water flows downwards. Those near the water can barely survive, while those in high places cannot draw water. Most of the thousands of acres of good land have been turned into stones, and most of the farmland in the four villages is barren. Although it rained at the beginning of autumn, it was too late. Although the withered rice has recovered, it is all showy but not fruitful. The miscellaneous grains that have been replanted are seedlings but not showy. There are more than 100,000 disaster victims, and their food is not sustainable, and their lives are in danger. (Anji) The total area of cultivated land in the county is 512,000 mu, and the disaster area is 358,000 mu, accounting for 70% of the total. (Disaster situation) The whole county is located in the mountains, and there are many mountain fields. This year's severe drought has caused all the rice, millet, and potatoes to wither and die. Although there were effective drought prevention measures beforehand, 90% of the mountain and ridge fields could not be irrigated for relief, resulting in no harvest. There are 100,000 disaster victims, who are picking ferns to fill their stomachs and plucking quinoa to fill their intestines. (Wukang) The total area of cultivated land in the county is 234,000 mu, and the disaster area is 234,000 mu, accounting for 100% of the total. (Disaster situation) The planted rice seedlings have withered, and the uncultivated farmland is cracked. Other miscellaneous grains, such as sweet potatoes, taro, and corn, have all withered and died. Even the large and small Mao bamboo in the mountains have died mostly due to prolonged dryness, which will affect production in the coming year. Moreover, several dikes and ponds in various places have collapsed due to excessive dryness. 60,000 disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, and their lives are in danger. (Xiaofeng) The total area of cultivated land in the county is 309,000 mu, and the disaster area is 222,000 mu, accounting for 72% of the total. (Disaster situation) Severe drought for months, mountain valleys have become streams, and the fields in small valleys and hills have become barren. There are 100,000 wailing victims waiting to be fed, and incidents of robbing food and committing suicide are heard every day.</p>

<h3 id="e136">### One Dead Sailor and One Passenger on the Xinfeng Ship Traveling Between Tianjin and Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's regular Beiyang ship, the Xinfeng, which departed from Tianjin, experienced an incident on the 15th of this month at 3:00 AM when the ship left the Dagu estuary. At 8:30 AM, it had reached the sea, and the ship was traveling very fast. A third-class passenger on the ship suddenly went from the third-class cabin to the first-class deck. At this time, the sea wind was quite strong, and the passenger, taking advantage of the lack of preparation, suddenly jumped into the sea to commit suicide. Inspector Li Mengsheng caught a glimpse of this and immediately tried to rescue him, but it was too late. He immediately reported to the administrative office, Wang Jiwu, and notified the ship owner to stop the ship immediately. Lifeboats were quickly lowered to rescue the passenger, and after he surfaced twice, he was rescued. However, by the time he was brought back on board, he had already died of suffocation due to being in the water for too long. On-site inspection revealed the passenger's name to be Jiang Defa, 40 years old. The reason for the suicide is unknown. The deceased was found to have eight yuan and nine jiao in silver coins and three hundred wen in cash. He also had a basket containing a washbasin, towel, and toothbrush cup. The deceased was wearing a Chinese-style cotton robe and a black cloth jacket. The Xinfeng ship carried the body to Yantai, where it docked at the Shengde pier. The body was transferred ashore and reported to the court for inspection. It will be temporarily stored in a coffin at Guangshiyuan, and if no one claims it within two months, it will be buried at the bureau's expense. The bureau received the report yesterday and ordered its branches to investigate the deceased's family and claim the body and belongings.</p>
<p>Another bizarre incident occurred on the Xinfeng ship. According to the sailor foreman, Wang Xiaoda, a sailor named Liu Ahua suddenly went missing from the sailor's section of the Xinfeng ship during its trip from Shanghai to Tianjin and back. A thorough search was conducted, but he could not be found. All the sailors said that Liu Ahua was still on board when the ship departed and that he was ill. It is possible that the sailor was working on deck at night when the ship was sailing in the Beiyang sea and was swept into the sea by the wind and waves. A request for compensation has been submitted to the head office.</p>

<p>Ms. Luo Chen, originally from Poland, is a highly accomplished writer and the wife of Mr. Hua Nan Gui, a pioneer in China's transportation industry. After coming to China, she wrote the book "Love and Obligation," which has been published in Chinese, English, and French. The Chinese and English versions were published by the Shanghai Commercial Press. In the form of a novel, it vividly depicts the conflict and distress between the old and new mentalities of young men and women in China's transitional era, as well as the drawbacks of uncritically adopting Western culture. It is truly a motto for Chinese youth. It was adapted into a film by a company in this country, and viewers were all moved. Her French title is Symphonie des Ombres Chinoises, published in Paris and sold by the Commercial Press. After reading this book, French intellectuals have changed their long-standing contempt for our country. Recently, she has written two new books, which will be published by the Commercial Press this year. One is a novel called "Double Practice," which describes the results of Chinese students sent abroad to study and the errors of this policy. It is quite thought-provoking to read. The other is a collection of essays called "Heart Writings," which are mostly aimed at the current state of Chinese society and offer many instructions for the behavior of young women in particular. Ms. Luo has come to Shanghai for a visit to discuss issues related to her writings.</p>

<p>Verdict Expected on the 25th After Yesterday's Conclusion of the Interrogation</p>
<p>Chen Fengxiang, the late manager of the Pudong Nanmatou map company, was quite wealthy, which led to his being targeted by bandits. On the afternoon of July 10th of this year, at 10:00 PM, they took the opportunity to abduct Chen Fengxiang's sixteen-year-old son, Chen Baoming, in Xuja and hid him in the house of Hu Yaoshi in Zhoupu.

<p>Hongkou Police Detective Chen Weikun and Detective Fang Fucheng were patrolling near Zha Pu Road at 9:15 PM the night before last when they saw two Cantonese men, Li Kangshan and Huang Bang, each carrying a paper bag. The bags were quite heavy, and their behavior was suspicious. They were stopped and taken to the police station. After reporting to the head of the police, the bags were opened and found to contain heroin. One bag weighed nine pounds, and the other weighed four and a half pounds. After questioning, it was learned that the drugs were given to them by a fellow villager named Zhao Gen, who lived at No. 6, Lane 360, Wuchang Road, to be transported to Guangdong and Hong Kong for sale. The detectives secretly went to the address and arrested a Cantonese woman, Huang Kuan. When asked where the drugs were hidden, she said that they were all in a wardrobe upstairs. They took the key, went upstairs, and opened the wardrobe, where they found three large bags of the same drugs, each weighing nine pounds, one small bag weighing four and a half pounds, a large can of red pills, counting several thousand, a seal, a ledger, twenty-four yuan in silver dollars, one yuan in cash, and more than ten yuan in coins. After a while, the Cantonese man Zhao Gen and Li Neng, who rented the house, arrived one after another and were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The lawyer of the Municipal Council, Li Zhishan, stated the facts and said that the defendants Li Kangshan and Huang Bang were sailors on a ship, and the mastermind, Wang Bing, was on the run. He requested that the case be postponed for further investigation.

<p>Dr. Feng Huaijing of traditional Chinese medicine has benefited deeply from the guidance of Mr. Zhang Jingchu of Menghe, a specialist in pulmonary tuberculosis. He often assists Dr. Zhang in diagnosis, so his medical knowledge is profound and he has saved countless lives. When Dr. Zhang moved to Suzhou, he entrusted all the clinical affairs in Shanghai to Dr. Feng. In addition to consumptive diseases, Dr. Feng also has special expertise in typhoid fever. Regardless of whether it is damp, warm, wind, or fire, once Dr. Feng diagnoses and treats it, danger is turned into safety. Recently, the wife of Mr. Zhou on North Sichuan Road had a huge carbuncle on her back, which had become a carbuncle. She cried out in pain day and night. Dr. Feng diagnosed and treated her several times, eliminating the accumulated toxins from the inside and preventing the unhealed wounds from the outside. She was completely cured in less than two weeks. It can be seen that Dr. Feng is not only proficient in internal medicine but also in external medicine, and can use medication to save people from suffering. Dr. Feng has now moved his clinic to No. 24 Chunyin Lane, Gordon Road, and I am writing this to inform those who have the same illness.</p>

<p>Five People Injured by Yesterday Afternoon's Bombing</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang Would Rather Die</p>
<p>The Yuelai Southern Goods Store at No. 356 Guangdong Road in the Public Concession of this city has been in business for a long time and has always been prosperous. It can be called one of the leading southern goods merchants in this city. The owner, Gong Fanglai, has been bombed once before, and the news has spread throughout the country. Gong actually took his anger out on the newspaper vendors who sell newspapers and arrested them in court, accusing them of interfering with his business. However, after the court trial, they were declared not guilty. Yesterday afternoon, someone went to bomb the store again, injuring five people on the spot. The details are described below:</p>
<p>A Loud Bang Occurred at 12:10 PM Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Around 12:10 PM yesterday afternoon, when most of the store's staff were having lunch in the back of the store, a young man suddenly came to the entrance, wearing a Zhongshan suit and carrying a paper bag under his left arm. After standing in front of the counter, he put a paper bag wrapped in newspaper on the counter. The store's staff thought it was a customer and was about to come forward to greet him when the paper bag suddenly exploded with a loud bang, sending iron shrapnel flying in all directions. The young man, three store staff members, and one customer were injured at the same time. Several pieces of glass next to the counter were also shattered.</p>
<p>The Bombing Youth After the bomb exploded, the young man turned and ran out. However, because his movements were slow, his left and right hands were severely injured. He managed to run to the entrance of the Kongming Electrical Appliance Store across the street before finally collapsing due to his injuries. At the same time, nearby neighbors heard the sound and came to investigate. After learning the details, they all stopped to watch. Nearby policemen also arrived after hearing the alarm and immediately arrested the bombing youth. They reported the incident to the police station, which sent a car to take the three injured staff members, one customer, and the bombing youth to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Patriot Crippled It was learned that the bombing youth was Liang Tongfang, who had previously served in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. After being demobilized and coming to Shanghai, he pulled a rickshaw for a living. Frustrated, he attempted suicide by taking poison at the Lao Dongfang Hotel on Hankou Road but was rescued. After being introduced, he studied at the Dongya Sports School in Xieqiao, Nanshi. Five fingers on his right hand had been blown off, and his left ring finger and little finger were also affected. The hospital considered his injuries to be critical and amputated his right hand. The other parts were bandaged. Due to the seriousness of the case, the police transferred him to the Municipal Council Hospital yesterday afternoon for surveillance. However, Liang will be crippled from now on.</p>
<p>List of the Injured The other injured persons are (1) Pan Hongchu, from Nanhui, injured his right hand and face; (2) Fu Yongsheng, from Nanhui, injured his left hand and left chest; (3) Ding Yanzhi, from Nanxiang, injured his head and face. All three were staff members of Yuelai Southern Goods Store. There was also one person named Pan Asan, who was a cook at the Tong Shen Customs Brokerage Company in Jinyu Dong Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao. He was going to buy dried shrimp for cooking noodles when he was injured. Fortunately, he was injured on his left hand, and the injuries were very minor. After Renji Hospital bandaged the wounds for each of them, they were discharged from the hospital. After the incident, the police went to investigate and sent two armed Chinese policemen to protect the entrance of the store. As for Liang's actions, he told people in the hospital that he would rather die.</p>

<p>Cai Zirong Accuses Him of Negligence Causing Death</p>
<p>Plaintiff Fails to Appear at the Trial</p>
<p>Zhu Ziyun, a well-known throat and pediatric specialist in traditional Chinese medicine, is from Jiangwan. He is 45 years old and has been practicing medicine for 25 years. His clinic is located at No. 447 Zhoujiazu Road, Hongkou, and his business is booming. He sees more than 200 patients a day. He has been targeted by bandits, and both kidnapping and robbery have occurred. Unexpectedly, he was recently sued by Cai Zirong, who lives at No. 26 Yisong Lane, Tokyo Road, in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Zhu of committing the crime of negligence causing death under Article 291, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting that he be punished according to the law. The facts are as follows: Cai Zirong had a son, Shunbao, who was less than 30 months old. In July of this year, he suddenly developed measles. On the 16th of this month, he went to Zhu for treatment. He was treated three times on the 16th, 18th, and 20th. On the 16th, the illness suddenly worsened, and he died soon after. Cai waited one month and seven days (September 2) and then entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to Zhu, saying that Shunbao's death was caused by Zhu's use of hot medicines such as cinnamon and aconite. He also attached three prescriptions and negotiated with him. Zhu replied that since the letter did not specify how the diagnosis was wrong, how the prescription was inappropriate, or whether the medicines were fatal, he could ask a traditional Chinese medicine organization to judge. Cai then filed a lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. Zhu Ziyun and his lawyer Lu Qi arrived on time, but the bailiff sent the summons to the plaintiff Cai Zirong at No. 26 Yisong Lane and was told that there was no such person. Therefore, he did not arrive. The court gave the prescriptions attached by Cai to Zhu to read. Zhu replied that he could not identify them as his prescriptions because they were not the originals. When asked if he had joined a public association, he replied that he had joined both the China and Shenzhou Medical Associations. Judge Wu stated that the plaintiff's address and other information still needed to be investigated, so he adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Totaling Over Four Thousand Volumes</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, regarding the disposal of various illegal printed materials confiscated in cases endangering the Republic of China, such as books and newspapers, had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for permission to burn them. Consequently, since its establishment, the court has held a public burning every three months. The various illegal printed materials confiscated and finalized in cases accumulated within the three months from July 1st to the end of September this year totaled more than eleven kinds. Among them, six kinds were bound into volumes, totaling approximately four thousand volumes. The remaining five kinds were leaflets. President Shen Jia-yi selected today at 2:00 PM to burn them publicly at the vacant lot of the Shantang Yizhong on the south side of the court, so that these seditious writings would all go with the First Emperor of Qin, preventing them from poisoning the world. In addition to submitting a separate report to the Ministry of Justice for record, the court had already issued and posted a notice yesterday to inform the public. Today, when burning, it also followed the precedent of sending invitations to representatives from various public offices (Party, government, military, police), the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Law Society, and other legal organizations in the city to attend and observe.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Fire at the LindDa Toy Store on Yu Garden New Road in Pudong <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The LindDa Toy Store at No. 2 Yu Garden New Road, Fuyou Road, west of the Xiaoshijie Amusement Park inside the New North Gate in Nanshi, is owned by Zhu Zhenlin, a local Shanghai resident who currently works for the Yiqun Real Estate Company at No. 587 Avenue Edward VII. Zhu's wife, Lu Baofeng, from Yuyao, and their one son and three daughters also reside upstairs in the store. Unexpectedly, at 0:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out downstairs in the store, quickly spreading out. Li Mingjun, a police officer from the 21st post of the Yimiao Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, discovered the fire and immediately used the telephone to notify the Fangbang Road Fire Brigade to send a fire truck to extinguish the flames. The fire was extinguished around 2:00 AM. Besides the total destruction of the store, the fire also spread to the ZhenDa Store opened by a Ningbo man surnamed Ma on the left and the Yonghe Toy Store on the right. Director Liu Yunfang of the branch arrived at the scene to suppress [the disturbance]. Zhu's wife was taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation and then transferred to the general bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e155">High Court Third Branch Prosecutor Attaches Importance to the Xue MaiLuo Major Robbery Case <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Personally went to the Robbery Site for Surveying and Mapping</p>
<p>Scheduled to Summon Employees Who Were Present at the Time</p>
<p>The case of the robbery of 12,000 yuan in cash from the Xue MaiLuo Accountant Firm on Avenue Edward VII, involving suspects Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Qingyue, and others, after being acquitted by the Special Second Court, was appealed by the Police Department to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court held a collegial panel hearing on the 12th of this month, but due to the first defendant, Zhang Zuming, being ill and absent, the hearing was postponed. This has been reported in the news. It is now known that the Third Branch of the High Court is taking this case very seriously. Recently, Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei led clerks to the Xue MaiLuo Accountant Firm for investigation, asking in detail about the circumstances of the robbery and drawing detailed diagrams for reference. Yesterday, Zhou Jinggeng, the compradore of the Xue MaiLuo Accountant Firm, was summoned to the court and interrogated by Judge Sun Honglin in the Fifth Tribunal. According to Zhou's testimony, he obtained banknotes from the China Industrial Bank through the Runfeng and Baokang pawnshops, signing contracts. I signed another contract with the pawnshops. The China Industrial Bank, through a Mr. Jin, sent the banknotes to the dog racing track and handed them over to Wei Huanzhang and Feng Zhidao. I, on behalf of the bank, disposed of the banknotes, receiving a commission of 5,600 yuan for every 200,000 yuan. At the time of the robbery, I was not at the scene. Only eight staff members and more than ten construction workers were at the scene. Accountant Mai Keluo has now passed away, etc. He also submitted two copies of the contracts signed with the bank and pawnshops. After verifying the testimony in court, it was ordered that next week, in the afternoon, all staff members of the firm who were at the scene during the robbery should wait in the firm for the court to investigate. After the order was given, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Fire at Morphine Factory on Wuding Road, Workers Burned, Secrecy Maintained <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Suffered Severe Injuries, Refused to Reveal a Single Word</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital with Detectives Stationed</p>
<p>The property of the Continental Bank at No. 930, Wuding Road, in Huxi, of which No. 14 was rented by Xi Pinshan, who established a morphine manufacturing factory and worked secretly. On the morning of the 16th of this month at 3:00 AM, the factory unexpectedly followed in the footsteps of the morphine factory opened by Cai Bicheng and was also burned down. Xi was unable to extinguish the fire himself and dared not announce the alarm, so he quietly escaped with the workers in the factory. Later, the gatekeeper of the alley discovered the fire and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to rush to the scene and cooperate with the fire brigade to put out the fire. The poisons in the house were listed and submitted to the First Special District Local Court for separate confiscation and preservation. This has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is now known that after the fire broke out in the drug manufacturing factory, Wang Nisheng, a 39-year-old worker from Ningbo, was unable to escape with the factory owner Xi Pinshan and others in time, resulting in severe burns to his head, face, hands, and feet. Although he escaped the danger from the flames, he dared not immediately go to the hospital for treatment. He endured the pain and went to hide and recuperate at the home of his fellow villager Wang Sanmao at No. 20 Changzhou Road. Unexpectedly, by noon the next day, his injuries had worsened, and his life was in danger. Wang Sanmao, seeing the situation, did not want him to stay for long and hired a car with his wife, Wang Wangshi, to accompany him to the Tongde Hospital on Tongfu Road. After the doctor treated him and asked about the cause of the burns, Wang Sanmao could not answer, and Wang Nisheng was even more secretive. The hospital became suspicious and notified the police station by telephone, which dispatched detectives to rush to the scene and investigate the injured man. However, he remained vague. The detective then recalled the fire on Wuding Road a few days ago and suspected that he was a worker from that factory, so he went to ask Wang Sanmao and Wang Wangshi whether they knew the injured man's background. According to them, when Wang Nisheng arrived at their house, he claimed to have been burned in a fire on Wuding Road, but they did not know how he had suffered this misfortune. The detective, believing that his guess was correct, transferred Wang Nisheng from Tongde Hospital to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital and again questioned him about the cause of his injuries. However, Wang still refused to reveal anything, falsely claiming that he had been burned in a fire in Suzhou and had come to Shanghai for treatment, etc. He still did not know that Wang Sanmao and others had revealed his background, so he made up this lie in the hope of deceiving them. Currently, the police department, because the suspect's injuries are very serious and require treatment, is not conducting a rigorous interrogation, but only dispatched detectives to the hospital to monitor him, waiting for his injuries to heal before thoroughly investigating and sending him to the court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Supporting Evidence for Monk Yuanzhao Stealing and Selling Property of Longhua Temple <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Prosecutor Investigates in Detail</p>
<p>To protect the temple property, Abbot Xingkong of Longhua Temple and landowner Lu Mingzhao and others filed a lawsuit in the local court's prosecutor's office against former Abbot Yuanzhao for stealing and selling temple property and appropriating it for his own use, requesting a strict investigation and also attaching civil claims. On the other hand, the Municipal Public Security Bureau apprehended Yuanzhao and recovered a small leather box containing various title deeds, which was transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Wu Deying interrogated him and ordered him to be detained for further investigation. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Xingkong and Lu Mingzhao and others thoroughly investigated and discovered that the evil monk Yuanzhao had stolen and sold temple property and embezzled temple funds, amounting to a considerable sum: (1) 37.399 mu of land in Xiaobenqiao, Yitu, 27th Bao, was donated by the Lu family (i.e., Lu Mingzhao's ancestors), with twelve land deeds stored in the temple for safekeeping. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Yuanzhao received them from Lu Mingzhao and rented them out, but subsequently sold them under false names, pocketing the proceeds. (2) More than 20 mu of land in Litahui and Zhujing, Jinshan County, was purchased by the former abbot Congpei during the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty and designated as temple property. (3) The Datong area of Lutang, Yitu, 27th Bao (now renamed 890th Tu), was formerly a reed marsh along the coast and was not demarcated into fields, but now it has become fertile land, about 20 mu, which Yuanzhao completely stole and sold to the Jisheng Society. In total, the value of the above-mentioned land is more than 100,000 yuan, all of which was sold by Yuanzhao and appropriated for his own use. It was further found that Yuanzhao had privately purchased properties in the French Concession and opened the Jinshan Cigarette Factory, secretly keeping wives and concubines and having children. Therefore, they reported the results of the investigation to the court for thorough investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Wu Deying ordered Lu Mingzhao and Zhang Liqing, the dibao of 27th Bao (now renamed 890th Tu), to be summoned to the court, and Yuanzhao, who was in custody, was brought in for questioning for a long time. As a result, Yuanzhao was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>A Nine-Year-Old Girl Becomes a Victim</p>
<p>How to Punish Rogues and Prostitutes</p>
<p>丨Transferring Syphilis: Extremely Vicious in Heart, Extremely Foolish in Deed丨</p>
<p>Xiao Lianke, a native of Yangzhou, is 35 years old. He used to work in the local police station and has been unemployed recently. He lives at No. 124 Pingjili Road in the French Concession with his wife, Zhang, 33 years old, and his daughter, Laixi, 9 years old. Xiao has an older sister, Fan Xiaoshi, who currently lives in the spare room of the home of Bian Shouan (48 years old), a fellow villager, at No. 222 Shengjili Kou, Mintini Yin Road. Bian Shouan and his wife, Bian Yushi, 45 years old, used to run a brothel at No. 4 Shengjili. Recently, due to the French police's crackdown on brothels, the Bian couple stopped their business because it was unprofitable and moved to No. 222 Shengjili Kou. Bian has a son named Yukang, also known as Xiao Anzi, 17 years old, who has not yet learned a trade and roams around every day. He is of bad character and recently became involved with a young prostitute, Zhang Xiaoxizi, 15 years old, from Rugao. Because the prostitute suffers from syphilitic sores, Bian Yukang contracted syphilis. Bian immediately argued with the prostitute, Zhang Xiaoxizi, who replied to Bian Yukang, "Don't worry, if you can rape a virgin, the poison in your body can be transferred to her, and your body can be restored to its original state." From then on, Bian and the prostitute Zhang were looking for a virgin in the hope of getting rid of the disease. Unexpectedly, Xiao Lianke's daughter, Laixi, went to play at her aunt Fan Xiaoshi's house on the afternoon of the 16th of this month around 7:00 PM. At that time, the girl's aunt, Xiaoshi, and Bian Shouan and Bian Yushi were all out on business. Only Bian's son, Yukang, was at home. At this time, the prostitute Zhang Xiaoxizi also went to Bian's house to chat with Yukang. Seeing Laixi nearby, she immediately instigated Yukang to commit bestiality. With Zhang Buxizi's help, they first pressed Laixi down on a wicker chair, pulled off her small clothes, and ordered Yukang to rape her. At that time, Laixi was young and weak and unable to resist, so she had to submit to their will and was defiled. After the act, Zhang and Bian Yukang threatened Laixi not to speak out. The girl was ignorant and endured in silence. After the act, the girl did not feel any pain until the next day when the girl's mother, Xiao Zhangshi, washed her daughter's clothes and saw stains on her pants. At first, she did not think it was strange, but when she washed the girl's clothes for the second time and saw blood stains on her pants, just like before, she paid attention and observed Laixi's actions for the past few days and felt that something was wrong. She then questioned the girl strictly, and the girl, unable to hide anything, told her mother everything. The Xiao couple were shocked and reported the incident to the French police station the day before yesterday. Detective Liu Songtian went to arrest Bian Yukang and the prostitute Zhang. After questioning by the police chief, Bian and others admitted to the rape. The police chief then ordered the girl to be sent to Guangci Hospital. The doctor examined her and found that Laixi had not only been injured by the rape but also contracted venereal disease, which had risen to her abdomen and was very serious. Based on the hospital's diagnosis, the police station sent the defendants to the Special Second Court for trial today.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Zhabei Businessmen Jointly Guarantee Zheng Tingfu <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Hundreds of Businesses Come Out to Jointly Guarantee</p>
<p>Saying It is Reactionary is Extremely Bizarre</p>
<p>After Zheng Tingfu, the owner of the Xin Kang Chemical Factory on Gonghe New Road, Hongnanshan, Zhabei, was arrested, various circles requested his release, but it has not been approved. Hundreds of businesses in the Zhabei district, such as Shunxin Lianyou, Sanmao, Ruitai, and Changrentai, jointly submitted a petition to the Central Party Department and the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting the Public Security Bureau to release him. The original petition stated, "Presenting a petition for the arrest of a good citizen, lamenting the closing of the Yuanmen, daring to directly state, humbly requesting that you quickly order the Public Security Bureau to release him. We businessmen have been operating in Zhabei for many years, acting cautiously and responsibly, and have never heard of any other situations. Now, regarding Zheng Tingfu, the owner of the Xin Kang Pharmaceutical Factory, he is filial to his parents, treats people kindly, and has never been heard to have any private party affiliations or ambiguous behavior. His reputation for loyalty and integrity is well known, and his name for not being obsequious is known to us businessmen. Today, he was suddenly arrested, claiming to have reactionary suspicions. We businessmen were shocked and terrified upon hearing the news. If Zheng Tingfu is truly as you say, with his bad deeds clearly visible, then let him be executed and punished, and he will die without regret. Calamity and blessings have no door, and destruction is self-inflicted. We businessmen also definitely do not want to aid the wicked, causing harm to society and danger to the country. However, there are things that we cannot remain silent about. Zheng Tingfu is neither a cunning and scheming person nor a desperate and lawless person. Observing his research in the chemical industry, he has spent more than 20 years, exhausting his efforts and sparing no effort. He established a factory in Hongnanshan, Zhabei, and has been there for 13 years. His business aspirations truly have a spirit of perseverance, which has led him to become a figure respected by everyone in the business community today. We businessmen are neither old friends nor close friends, but we are in close proximity and have more accurate knowledge. In ordinary times, we have never seen the slightest flaw. Now, suddenly he is said to have reactionary suspicions, which is extremely bizarre. At this time of national turmoil, it is the time for villains to cast shadows on others. Even famous scholars cannot escape slander. How can a mere businessman bear this? Thinking of Your Departments and Government as the protectors of our people, if Zheng Yanfu's strange injustice is only slightly illuminated by the candor of truth and falsehood, we are deeply afraid that the forging within will destroy the bones and tails. Therefore, we businessmen dare to prove his usual behavior and especially jointly appeal to Your Departments and Government to quickly order the Municipal Public Security Bureau to release him in order to maintain goodness and secure business, then we will be grateful beyond measure. We respectfully present this petition."</p>

<p>Zhang Yinsheng and others identify Chen Agen</p>
<p>Mao Quanzhong, a staff member of the Yimiao Police Station in the city, was patrolling Fuyou Road at 10:00 AM yesterday when he saw two vegetable stalls obstructing traffic and ordered them to close. Unexpectedly, the stall vendors, named Zhang Yinsheng (43 years old, from Jiangyin) and Zhao Dean (29 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 2 Hengdeli, Fuyou Road), claimed that they paid a monthly stall donation of $1.20 and were not in violation of regulations. Staff member Mao immediately asked to see the receipt, and they claimed that the stall donation was paid to Chen Agen, who was acting as a public official, and insured by Chen, so there was no receipt. Believing that the case involved the private collection of stall donations, he took the two stall vendors to the police station for verification. According to the defendant's confession, Chen Agen lived at No. 1 Ruyili, Wutong Alley. Director Liu immediately sent the police to bring Chen Agen to the station. Chen, who claimed to be a 27-year-old fish vendor from Ningbo, denied collecting the donations. However, the two stall vendors, Zhang and Zhao, identified him as the one to whom they had paid the money in person. The case involves impersonating a public official, collecting donations from stall vendors without authorization, and is suspected of deception and fraud to obtain wealth. It has been ordered to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>The Dalong Woolen Mill in this city, with its prosperous business over the years, found its original distribution office on Qipan Street inadequate for its operations. Recently, it has finalized the address at 357 Nanjing Road, west end of Ao Jin Li, for expansion. The door sales department is also being hastily renovated and will soon begin operations. The mill's excellent products have long been recognized by people in society, and wholesale sales to local and out-of-town areas are particularly brisk. The factory is processing and weaving day and night, with a strong tendency to be unable to meet demand. As autumn weather arrives, with alternating sunny and rainy days, wearing woolen products can protect body temperature and benefit health. Even after a little rain, one will not feel the cold. Those who have worn them already praise them. When the door sales department opens soon, it will surely be a scene of overwhelming business.</p>

In recent days, customers have been crowding in, and business has increased dramatically.

Recently, a large batch of valuable items such as crepe clothing materials and leather suitcases have been added to be available for collection. However, the grand prize, a large bronze bed worth one hundred and twenty yuan, has not yet been claimed.

Therefore, the factory is working day and night to rush production. The materials for the soft ladder have also been innovated to be lightweight and convenient. The factory has also recently invented dozens of types of products such as bank note thread, bookbinding thread, and weaving flower thread, for use by all sectors. In order to promote the production of domestic products, the price is only sold at cost, it is said. The distribution office is located at 20 Huajin Lane, Four-Horse Road.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Third 回: Unresolved, Zero Peek Door, Pity for the Girl, Willing to Hear Hardships, Cherishing Jade, Visiting a Poor Family</p>
<p>On the flat ground, there was a rectangular earthen platform. That was the sleeping pit. Some wooden stakes were nailed to the earthen wall, and a few large and small holes were dug. Their family's boxes and cabinets were all there. Poor people are really poor to this extent. I think that is no different from a dead body lying on the ground. Your Little Western Paradise is a place frequented by wealthy people. It seems that although we are not wealthy, if you told me to live in a cave, I would not do it either. Why do you want to make caves? The tea house boy pouted his mouth toward the back of the house and laughed, "The caves are in the backyard. You can go and see them." They are all caves, but there is a big difference between good and bad. Cheng Zhiqian laughed, "I want to see how good they are." Saying this, he left this small courtyard and walked toward the large courtyard behind. Here, there was an old house being demolished, leaving only a little of its skeleton. Lime and hemp ropes were piled up inside, as well as the tools used by the craftsmen. Passing through this old house, there were two or three courtyards of newly built houses that had not yet been completed. Eight hundred and ten carpenters and masons were all out of work, gathered in the courtyard. Cheng Zhiqian thought to himself, could there be some problem? So he walked closer to take a look. By the time he entered this courtyard, it turned out that the workers were having a meal. Observing it, there was a special scene. They were in piles of three, groups of five, either sitting around the edge of the stone steps or sitting against the wall in a straight line. They were all covered in mud and ash, so they could not be considered clean, so everyone was sitting on the ground. In the midst of all these people, there was a large wicker basket filled with fist-sized cold black buns. Next to the basket was a wooden bucket with a lid, filled with a bucket of water. It looked like it was hot, but it was not boiled water, because the workers were seen drinking the water very casually, not as if it was scalding their mouths. There were also dozens of earthenware bowls and a basket of chopsticks. When the workers came, they took a bowl and a pair of chopsticks. Then the hand holding the chopsticks took a piece of black bun from the basket. As for the earthenware bowl, it was used to scoop more than half a bowl of water from the bucket. (44)</p>
<h3 id="e174">On Mother Guo's Affairs <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Shaokuang</p>
<p>Men of extraordinary talent and character are often established through the teachings of virtuous mothers. This is true in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. In recent times, many virtuous leaders of the party and the country, and prominent figures in society, have followed their mother's teachings, strived to achieve their ambitions, and created great careers. In the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, I first met Mr. Guo Jianying at sea and deeply admired his dignity and composure, which were unlike ordinary people. After a conversation, I learned the details of his mother's life. I respectfully said: The sacred and beautiful virtues of Madam Tai are worthy of being passed down! According to: Madam Tai's surname is Xiao, the eighth daughter of Mr. Xiao Minji of Southern Guangdong. Mr. Xiao lived in Honolulu and started his career in trade. Although he accumulated a great fortune, Madam Tai was frugal and restrained her desires, never confined by extravagant habits. At the age of eighteen, she married Mr. Guo Ronghui. The following year, she gave birth to Mr. Jianying. A year later, Mr. Guo passed away. Madam Tai became a widow and was so grief-stricken that she did not want to live. At that time, Mr. Guo's parents were still healthy. Madam Tai piously served her esteemed elders, diligently raised her orphaned son, never disobeying or neglecting, teaching and nurturing him, and became a model for women in the village, praised by everyone. After her parents-in-law passed away, Madam Tai supervised Mr. Jianying's education even more vigorously. Madam Tai was from Zhongshan and had heard much about Mr. Sun Yat-sen, a great man of his generation, whose love of learning in his youth and diligence in his adulthood were due to a good family education. Therefore, she constantly instructed Mr. Jianying, saying: "Your father passed away early. You should strive to study hard and inherit your father's legacy." She further said: "When you have completed your studies and put them to use in the future, serving society, you should make serving the motherland your primary goal, and do not be content with personal wealth and comfort." When Mr. Jianying completed his studies, he traveled to Australia to engage in trade. He was unwilling to become a wealthy merchant and was always concerned about national affairs, thinking of emulating Bu Shi's contribution to the border. If not for Madam Tai's past diligent teachings, how could he have achieved this? In the autumn of the twenty-second year, Mr. Jianying, realizing that the national crisis was becoming increasingly urgent, did not have time to live in peace. He traveled across the ocean to conduct foreign publicity and raise funds for emergency relief. At that time, Madam Tai died of illness in her village. Mr. Jianying has been grieving ever since for not being able to care for her until the end of her life. Alas! Madam Tai's expectations of Mr. Jianying were only to be public-minded and forget private interests, to be concerned about the country and forget the family. Now that Mr. Jianying is able to worry about the country as if he were hungry and thirsty, I know that Madam Tai will be smiling in the afterlife. What else could she regret? Madam Tai was born in the thirty-second year before the founding of the Republic of China and lived to the age of fifty-four. She had a son, Jianying, two grandsons, and one granddaughter.</p>

<p>— Xu Bibo</p>
<p>In recent years, the sound of change, change has made a lot of noise. No matter what field you are in, if there is no new reform, people are gathering there to discuss, "He is behind the times." Even when it comes to literature and art, Classical Chinese is indeed outdated to the extreme, and even the use of Vernacular Chinese, there are many gentlemen who like change, clamoring to use Popular Language to overthrow it. I can't help but think of the outdated and outdated proverb poem, "The waves of the Yangtze River urge the waves ahead, new people in the world replace old people," using a sentence or two to compare with the current situation, I really feel a lot of emotion!</p>
<p>However, no matter what, if it has its own indelible true value, no matter how it changes, there will always be someone who can express sympathy for it. Just like Classical Chinese, although some people think it is outdated, there are others who think it is a national treasure and always maintain a spirit of support, so that it is not completely buried.</p>
<p>The current martial arts novels are certainly also being eliminated. People who are generally overcorrecting directly regard the two words "martial arts" as poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Therefore, the spirit of the people is gradually declining, and it has become a cowardly habit of "non-resistance." This really makes people with good intentions feel short of breath!</p>
<p>My friend Gu Mingdao, because of illness in his feet, had to retire to his hometown and devote himself to writing. At first, he used the "Tidujuan Record," which earned people's tears, to win the welcome of the world, but he was too accustomed to decadence. So he shifted his magnificent style and changed to writing long works of "patriotic," "revolutionary," and "martial arts" genres, especially "Wild River Female Knight" was the most popular. Because this novel mixes the above three kinds of consciousness, depicting a prostitute female knight Fang Yuqin, like a raging fire, simply makes people want to forget to eat and sleep after reading his works. Youlian Film Company also explored and produced the film, which is even more popular in the world, complementing each other. Now his fourth giant work is meeting the world again. He entrusted the Samsung Bookstore, which published this book, to send me a copy. After reading it, I feel that it is carrying on from the past and opening up to the future, with wonderful ideas arising in a loop. And writing about Yuqin's lively and vibrant posture is really enough to make people feel leisurely and distant.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In this enormous green gauze tent, there is enough space to hide a huge number of cavalry: not to mention that people's bodies will never be seen by outsiders, even the horses' feet will absolutely not be exposed.</p>
<p>At this time, the area we were passing through was very desolate. There were no grand or numerous buildings on either side of the tracks: only piles of scattered low houses, covered with broken tiles, mostly the nests of poor people, sheltering them from wind and rain. There were also some wild or domesticated beasts, such as cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, deer, etc., moving about in the fields: some of them immersed their entire bodies in those filthy little rivers, getting completely covered in mud, which was also quite laughable. The Empress Dowager usually liked birds and beasts very much. Now that she saw them jumping freely in the wild, she was of course particularly interested. Unfortunately, among the people she brought, from the accompanying ministers down to the little eunuchs, there was no one who had a special knowledge of zoology, otherwise she would definitely have reused them immediately.</p>
<p>In Guanwai, since it is generally also within Chinese territory, then there is one thing that is naturally indispensable! That is, many mounds full of fields, the graves of dead people. The Chinese people's lack of understanding of economic principles in the use of land is everywhere; but in Guanwai, the wild grass seems to grow more luxuriantly than in Guannei, so each tomb has a green and oily grass mat spread over it, which looks relatively beautiful! There are no high mountains rising here. On the horizon, there are only these mounds. (154)</p>

<p>— (Cheng Zhao)</p>
<p>Lanzhou is located on the banks of the Yellow River, with fertile soil and convenient irrigation. Therefore, in addition to growing wheat and grains, most residents take growing melons, fruits, tea, and vegetables as their "only" sideline business.</p>
<p>Every evening, in the quiet river under the hazy moonlight, the fruit vendors leisurely row their small boats to the villages to sell the goods for the next day. While "yanking" the oars, they also hum a "little tune," which is quite exciting and flavorful.</p>
<p>When the sky has not yet revealed the whiteness of the fish's belly, the fruit vendors have already rowed their heavy boats back, busily washing the "new goods" in preparation for the early market.</p>
<p>Lanzhou's special famous fruits include several kinds such as apples, pears, persimmons, "stupid eggs" (a local fruit), and sand fruits. Watermelons and cucumbers are rare.</p>
<p>Every day, the money earned by fruit vendors is about two or three yuan, which is enough for a family's expenses! So the life of Lanzhou fruit vendors is really very affluent.</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3 id="e181">More on Opening Remarks <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Zi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhang Zhenlü's "On Opening Remarks," many unsystematic thoughts floated into my mind!</p>
<p>Since the popularity of wireless radio, every household, with great effort, has been constantly filled with the sounds of stringed instruments. Storytellers, thanks to the blessings of material civilization, have had a good run of business. The opening remarks, as an accessory, have also become fashionable. Last year, I compiled "The Green Butterfly Double Ballad" for Zhao Hesun and "The Imperial Stele Pavilion Ballad" for Zhu Yaoxiang and Zhao Jiaqiu. Thus, I began to correspond with storytellers, who then requested me to write opening remarks. I couldn't help but respond with a few pieces. In reality, this "toy" is not easy to deal with. If it's too profound or too elegant, the listeners won't understand. If it's too crude or shallow, it becomes like the Eastern Village tune, making people's hairs stand on end. The ballad singer Qi Lianfang told me that Mr. Mao Zijian enjoyed listening to stories but rarely approved of the opening remarks written by contemporaries. He only praised the opening remarks written by Mr. Qi Fanniu and myself, saying they were both elegant and popular. In fact, Mr. Qi, as a literary figure and a member of the Guangyu Society, had poetic fame in his youth. Now, in his old age, he uses his remaining energy to do these playful writings. His works, which can be called "domestic treasures", are naturally extraordinary. As for me, I just scribble them down when I'm in a good mood, without caring about the skillfulness. I'm afraid I've failed Mr. Mao Zijian's praise!</p>
<p>There is a ballad singer who can write his own opening remarks. Regardless of whether they are well-written or not, he can still be considered outstanding among the mediocre! When his father died, he composed an opening remark mourning his father, which became very popular. Radio stations played it almost every day. However, upon closer examination, it's simply not a good example! Throughout history, how many poets and lyricists have we seen include poems or lyrics mourning a father in their collections? Because the immeasurable depth of parental kindness cannot be described with words. In ancient times, people could compose poems on high ground, writing about mountains and rivers, or the two capitals, but we never heard of anyone writing about the universe. The ancients had a saying: "Extreme sorrow has no words." When the one who gave us life passes away, we are too busy crying and longing for them to have the mood to search for phrases and compose music. However, having said that, in this day and age, knowing how to "gain a reputation for filial piety" is still considered gentlemanly. It is already extremely rare for fashionable people not to follow Chen Duxiu in shouting the slogan "Of all evils, filial piety is the greatest"!</p>
<p>Zhu Yaoxiang published a collection of opening remarks called "Joy in Books," half of which were old opening remarks from manuscripts, and half of which were new works sent to him by listeners outside of Shanghai after he broadcasted on the radio. Because he was afraid that there might be inappropriate content, he asked me to revise a portion of it. I believe that although this "toy" is a minor skill, those without considerable cultivation in classical poetry should not even think of dealing with it! Because the tones are actually natural rhythms, and opening remarks, like classical poetry, must pay attention to tones. As for the rhyming parts, although "Dong Dong" and "Jiang Yang" are commonly used interchangeably, one must follow the Suzhou dialect. For example, although "shi" (時) and "li" (離) both belong to the fourth branch, it is best to avoid using them in opening remarks! It can be seen that even this small "toy" has rules and regulations, which cannot be imitated by those who casually start writing!</p>
<p>Storytellers are very good at taking shortcuts. A few days ago, I saw that Zhu Yaoxiang had taken a segment from the Imperial Stele Pavilion, which I wrote for him, where Meng Yuehua and Wang Youdao's younger sister tease each other, and turned it into an opening remark called "Sister-in-law Teasing," which was published in the News Evening Post. Also, an opening remark about Chen Sufen's love death that was published in a small newspaper was clearly written by me, but the storyteller who liked it wrote his name on it and claimed it as his work. It's truly a case of eating and forgetting who grew the rice! However, appropriating someone else's work as one's own, when facing one's conscience, I'm afraid one can't help but feel ashamed, right?</p>
<h3 id="e182">Correspondence <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the "Chun Qiu" section:</p>
<p>Regarding the postscript in your newspaper's "The Fragrant Incense Misty Records" from October 4th, "Yesterday, I was informed by Mr. Yi that according to the Qing Dynasty regulations, only high-ranking Manchu officials could use the term 'slave,' so Yuan Shikai should have referred to himself as '臣' (subject) when meeting with Empress Dowager Cixi," I, during the late Qing Dynasty, worked in the office of Jiangbei Governor-General Wang Shizhen. I saw that his memorials referred to himself as "slave," and Wang was from Zhengding Prefecture, not a Manchu bannerman. At the time, I was also suspicious of this. Later, I consulted with Xu Yusheng, a document specialist, who said that all Han Chinese military officials who were qualified to submit memorials directly could refer to themselves as "slave." When Yuan Shikai was in charge of the six towns of the Beiyang Army, he referred to himself as "slave" when meeting with the Empress Dowager. This may have been permitted by Qing Dynasty regulations. Today, people are ashamed to call themselves "slave," but back then, it was an honor. I offer what I have heard for your reference and respectfully request Mr. Yi's guidance.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>Yan Zhongwen respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Ministry of Education Approves University Staff Pension <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Regulations have been promulgated... Qinghua and Beijing Normal University staff now receive pensions</p>
<p>After the National Government promulgated the Regulations on Pensions and Bereavement Allowances for School Staff and Teachers in previous years, there have been some requests for bereavement allowances. However, there have not been many requests for pensions. Although there are not many teachers who are over sixty years old and have worked in schools for fifteen consecutive years, some may have been discouraged from applying due to financial difficulties in education, administrative inabilities, or fear that the process would be difficult. However, since the government has established regulations, there will eventually be a day when they are universally implemented. The implementation of this pension system is a great comfort to those who have served diligently in the field of education and is welcomed by educators nationwide. It has been learned that the Ministry of Education issued certificates in July (previously approved by the Executive Yuan and then by the National Government for record) to those who are entitled to pensions. One such person is Wang Lianxi, a staff member of National Tsinghua University, who has served for more than ten years and is over sixty years old. He will receive an annual pension of 504 yuan starting from his retirement. Recently, the pension of Wang Xin, a staff member of Beijing Normal University, was also approved for an annual payment of 210 yuan (having served for more than fifteen years but less than twenty years). The Ministry of Education has submitted the situation to the Executive Yuan for approval and referral to the National Government for record.

<p>The Moore Hall Basketball Tournament has been underway for two months since it began. Because a double round-robin system is used, the strength of each team is considered average, so the competition is extremely intense. The participants in this competition include Jincheng, Chen Team, Baofeng, Hongguang, Laoye, Leyi, Sanjia, and Sanyi, a total of eight teams. Among them, Jincheng has won every game, so its score is the highest among all the teams. The team currently has two games remaining. If it does not forfeit temporarily, then the outcome and the championship are irrelevant. The runner-up spot is more likely to go to the Chen Team.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Yesterday's Financial Situation Was Very Different From the Previous Day; Speculative Premiums Fell by 31 Yuan <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>News of Suppression Arose, Buyers Began to Emerge</p>
<p>The gold market, which had been rising sharply for days, fell yesterday due to the stabilization of public sentiment. This was a normal phenomenon after a continuous rise. Many parties sold off, and there was still a large amount of pressure in the market. At the same time, rumors far from the truth were spreading. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw continued declines in both England and the United States, exchange rates rose uniformly, and the price of gold in London fell by six pence. Reports in newspapers that the Ministry of Finance and the banking industry were doing their best to suppress the gold market and use balancing forces were numerous. In addition, rumors that the market price quoted by the Central Bank would be supplied as much as possible, etc., made people feel exhausted. In fact, after a sharp rise in speculative trading, a reversal was inevitable. It was also reported that there had been transactions at 980 yuan in the night market, causing the market to anticipate a drop. The initial calls were for 890 yuan, but there were no transactions, and the situation was chaotic. The depletion of chips in the market was very obvious. It immediately rebounded to over 1,000 yuan. After the opening, although it fell due to the news that the market price quoted by the Central Bank was level in England but up 0.0625 in the United States, the tariff fell by six percent, and the standard speculative premium was fixed at 985 yuan and a half, trading was still active but without a market. People became agitated again. Although the foreign exchange market was loose, it was not much, and the short sellers in the market covered again, gradually pulling the price up. The appetites of banks varied, but the foreign exchange market was trending towards tightening. Public sentiment was still stable, and the price rose to 1,008 yuan. Afterwards, the Guangdong banks began to sell off, and the price of gold softened, but it still struggled around the 1,000 yuan mark. When unfavorable news, such as the preparation of huge amounts of drafts and the joint suppression of the foreign exchange market by three banks, resurfaced, the Guangdong banks continued to maintain their downward pressure. Thereafter, sellers emerged slightly, and a downward trend began, but there was much hesitation along the way. As the foreign exchange market hardened, with the exchange rate for British currency at 1.4 and the exchange rate for US currency at 33.0625 yuan, the price retreated to within 990 yuan, falling by nearly twenty yuan. However, the overall trend was still flat, and it stabilized after the low, with the price of gold gradually rising again. This was because chips were still scarce and there were no sellers. The market was initially stable but then weakened. Large investors' desire to sell resurfaced, and the foreign exchange market also became loose and flooded, so the market situation weakened. General buyers waited patiently for the opportunity, so the pressure began to take effect. However, there was still much struggle after the low. Later, the domestic market became even harder, once retreating into the 80-yuan range. Buyers became active when the price was low, and the selling pressure disappeared again at this point. The market rebounded significantly before closing. The turbulence throughout the day was still great, but it was not as severe as in the previous days. This was also a common phenomenon. Small short positions at low prices were mostly squeezed, so the overall trend turned weak. There were no large sellers in the market, and the extremely large short position of Tongfeng Yong was also unexpected and worthy of attention. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened at 1,000 yuan, down 17 yuan from the previous close. Yuanchun sold off smoothly, retreating from 1,001 yuan to 996 yuan. The Central Bank's quoted price was level for British currency but up 0.0625 for US currency, and the tariff was down six percent. However, Zhengchang, Wanxing, Hengyu, and Yongheng still bought on the dip, pushing the price up to 1,004 yuan. Dafa and Yongshun Mao sold off. At this time, the market situation was softer, with supply exceeding demand, and it retreated to 998.5 yuan. After all, the Central Bank's quoted price had no buying or selling, and public sentiment was still good. Yuqing, Yongshen, and Changyong bought off one after another, and the price rose to 1,007.7 yuan. Hongli, Qingyu, Fuxing Yong, etc., sold off, gradually retreating to within 2 yuan. Bingxing, Hengyu, Fuxing Yong suddenly came in to buy, and the price rose to 8 yuan. Dingkang, Dadecheng, Yifeng Yong sold off, retreating to 2 yuan. At this time, because the HSBC Bank's quoted prices for British and American currency did not move, public sentiment stabilized. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Qingyu, Yuanyi, etc., advanced to over 5 yuan. Dingkang, Yuanmao Yong supplied on the high, and Huabi sold November shillings at 6.875, and it retreated to 1.5 yuan. Afterwards, the market atmosphere was still sharp. After Hengyu, Fuxing Yong, Dadecheng advanced, the price was raised to 8 yuan again. Small investors and Dadecheng, Zhaofeng, Changqing, Fayong, Fuxing, Hengyu, etc., suddenly came to sell off. The banks also filled shillings at 6.875, and the price broke the 1,000 yuan mark, retreating to 999 yuan. Hengxing Yuan and Fuxing Yong came in on the dip, and the price rose to 1,006 yuan again. Afterwards, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Shengsheng Dafu, Yu Qingyong, etc., sold off together. Unfavorable rumors spread. The current US dollar price of 32.5 yuan has been sold from Korea. Thereafter, there were few buyers for 5.625, and the 1,000 yuan mark was broken first. Selling pressure increased, and the price fell to 990 yuan. Qingyu, Fu Changheng, Yujin to 4.5 yuan, but Huabi came out, shillings in January already at 875, Yuan Mao Yong Hongli sold to one and a half yuan, Pangen filled, American gold in December at 8125, Dadecheng and Yong Li still, and the price rose to 4.5 yuan. Afterwards, British gold was one shilling and four pence, and US currency could be settled at 33.0625 yuan. Fu Changyuan, Changyong, Qian Changxiang, Dafa, Yongxiang He, etc., sold off sharply, and the price fell to 88 yuan. Dadecheng, Shunmao, Daxing Yong bought off, and the price rose to 91.5 yuan. Yuanchun, Yuanchang, Yongtai, Fuxing Yong sold to 88 yuan again. Buyers poured in at the dip, and the market price was able to be maintained. Huixiang, Yuanchun, Shunli, Shunmao, etc., bought one after another. Even though Yuanmao Yong and Fuxing Yong supplied, they were still able to gradually pull the price up. At noon, the market closed at 994.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 993 yuan. Qingyu, Fu Chang, Dafa Yong entered the market, and the price rose from 2.5 yuan to 5 yuan. Citibank filled January shillings at 125, Huabi filled the same month at 1875, Yuqing Yong, Dafa Yong, Hengyu Fuxing Yong sold off in force, and the price retreated to 86 yuan. Hengxing came up and filled orders sharply, and the price rose to 90.5 yuan. Afterwards, the domestic market hardened. Dadecheng, Fuxing Yong, Fuyu, Fuchang, etc., sold sharply, and a selling pressure immediately arose. Citibank filled December American gold at half a yuan, and Dadecheng, Fuxing Yong, Fuyu Qian Changxiang resold to 82 yuan. Hengxing Yuan and Mao Yong still filled on the dip, and the price rose to 4.7 yuan. Bombay rose ten anna. Qian Changxiang, Xianghe, Richang Yong, Yisheng, etc., sold off sharply. Anda filled December American gold at 6875, and the price fell to 80 yuan. Dakang, Yuqing Yong, Yongli, Yuanfeng Yong went to 4.6 yuan. As the foreign exchange market hardened, Qian Changxiang and Dadecheng resold and the price fell to 78.5 yuan. Fuxing Yong, Dakang Fuyu, Shunli Qian Changxiang, Dadecheng, etc., bought continuously, gradually rising. The price then rose to 90.05 yuan. Meifeng filled February American gold at 4375, and Fuxing Yong, Hengyu, Dalian Gang, etc., sold off, falling to 75 yuan. Dadecheng, etc., bought off, and the price rose to 7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong came to sell and the price fell again. When the market closed, the price was 986 yuan. After the market closed, Futai Heng and Fuxing Yong, etc., bought slightly, and the price gradually rose to around 8 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 1,008 yuan and the lowest price was 978.5 yuan, a difference of 29.5 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell by 31 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the standard speculative premium price quoted by the Central Bank, was reduced to 985.5 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was still slightly raised, but it was raised 28 yuan less than the previous closing price. The old standard for November, because the HSBC Bank's US currency quoted price did not change, was still calculated at 31.875, which corresponded to a speculative premium price of 1,085 yuan. The account for this month was 997 yuan, for November 997 yuan, and for December 995 yuan. The morning replenishment was 997 yuan. The price of pure gold was 1,009 yuan, approximately an increase of 9 yuan. The afternoon market booked 988 yuan for this month, 988 yuan for November, and 986 yuan for December.

Although the pound was stable and the dollar rose 0625, there was no appetite to sell, lacking stimulus. The HSBC bank posted its rates, both the pound and dollar were stable. After this, the mentality of Chinese merchants turned soft, and they tended to sell. The process gradually trended toward firmness. Rumors that our country has a stabilization fund similar to the United States, to suppress the market, though felt to have little impact, but thereafter, the exchange market had some supply daily, and the situation failed to be tight. The market immediately loosened, and banks rushed to sell. Although Chinese merchants were scrambling to buy, their appetite was weak. Bombay rose, and the process gradually trended toward firmness, but the overall trend was ultimately erratic. The gold market rebounded together, and the domestic market immediately turned tight.

<p>The cotton market fell sharply, and the intensity of the decline is also frightening. Due to the sharp fall in the gold market, rumors in the business community are confusing and unfavorable to the longs. Generally, floating longs are eager to liquidate, resulting in a very loose market and a lack of buyers. This kind of sharp rise and fall is entirely due to the excessive volume of chips held by both longs and shorts. Once there is a reversal, it is difficult to stop. However, future turbulence is still lurking.</p>
<p>Floating Longs Forcefully Liquidate Spot Cotton. The market situation changed drastically at the opening of the spot cotton market. Buyers were lacking because the news from all parties was unfavorable to the longs. Therefore, many floating longs were very worried. The market fell by one yuan. After two or three rounds of bidding, a large number of longs liquidated. As a result, each month fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan, 1.3, 4 jiao. The opening was still good in the afternoon. After two or three rounds of bidding, the liquidation of the bankers' longs was particularly weak. The closing rebounded slightly. As a result, each month fell by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 4 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume for the day was 328,100 dan. It was found that Runkang sold 6,000 dan, Yuanda 6,000 dan, Dafu 19,800 dan, Tongji 6,900 dan, Daji 5,300 dan, Huikang 5,300 dan, Shenchang 41,300 dan, Dafu 2,000 dan, Hengde 2,900 dan, Hengchang 2,000 dan, Deji 2,700 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,000 dan, Changhe 10,400 dan, Shenji 2,800 dan, Jifeng bought 9,300 dan, Tongfu 5,100 dan, Yukang 4,600 dan, Suilong 5,700 dan, Yuanda 20,100 dan, Gengfeng 8,900 dan, Ruida 13,300 dan, Tongfeng 11,000 dan, Yichang 11,700 dan, Changfeng 10,300 dan, Runkang 4,100 dan, and Xincheng 3,100 dan.

<p>丨Resulting in Small Losses of 1-2 Jiao to About One Yuan丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly reversed. Many large investors came out to trade, mostly due to misunderstandings regarding the silver tax issue. Opinions differed as to whether it was beneficial to the government bond market or not. Furthermore, the sharp decline in yarn and cloth caused a return of wind in the government bond market, so it could not be exempt either. During this period of large-scale trading, both long and short positions had a state of not being able to clearly identify their goals. The future will be uncertain for another day or two, and then it will trend upward. The process yesterday, the opening price carried the rise of the previous day, continuing to rise by three or four jiao. After entering, from the salt tax onwards, the number 53 was sold more, and the market price gradually went downstream. Small losses were seen in each item. Because the number 6 rose more than the others on the previous day, it also fell the most, by seven and a half jiao. After this change in the market, it has become temporarily unable to stabilize. The second round was a consistent small decline. Most of them started from 19 Shan, because the number 41 was sold in a very surging manner, so the price decreased round by round, and a consistent decline was seen. The loss was calculated as 1-2 jiao to 6-7 jiao. Only one round was done in the afternoon. The market price recovered slightly by three or four jiao. The trend is likely to be in a state of chaos because there are not many days left for the October futures. It is appropriate to encounter this eventful time, so the rise and fall may not follow the usual pattern. As a result of the market price, the losses ranged from 1-2 jiao to about 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 30 million. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, stock unit: one share).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Trading Company reported that yesterday (18th) the New York stock market hovered all day and was extremely stagnant. Before the close, the market turned upward because of the good operating report of the Gillette Safety Razor Company, and the company's stock was very strong. Gold and silver stocks eased due to continued rumors of the government leaning to the right. Traders paid close attention to the report of the major US copper mining companies' plan to reduce production by 20%. The bond market was liquidated on the long side, with mixed slight declines. Small exchange stocks were dragged down by mining stocks. Chicago wheat eased due to the weakness of foreign markets and rainfall in the winter region. The total transaction volume for the day was 660,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>丨Far-Month Wheat Plummets Two Jiao Two丨</p>
<p>The flour market opened slightly lower in the morning because the previous day's surge had no real reason. Although it had already fallen on that day, people were very uneasy. Yesterday, it continued to fall, and both factory owners and customer groups sold off. The buyers of the previous day also turned short. The market saw an extreme plummet. Although there was short covering in the afternoon, the factory output was incessant, and the market fell step by step, lacking any vitality. The closing price was 7.75 fen lower for this month, 8.75 fen lower for next month, 9.25 fen lower for December, 9.25 fen lower for January, and 1 jiao and 05 li lower for February.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the prices of all months fell sharply. Because the flour market had already fallen the previous day, while the spot wheat had not yet fallen, new shorts and liquidations competed to come out. Merchants also sold off at high prices, and the flour was also shorted. Furthermore, the flour market fell again on that day, and the gold price and foreign wheat were both reported to be lower. The market was completely overshadowed by selling pressure. The decline was more acute than the rise of the previous day. The final closing price was 1 jiao and 7 fen lower for October and December, 1 jiao and a half lower for November, and 2 jiao and 2 fen lower for both January and February. Spot wheat was also 1 jiao lower. Extra-grade wheat was only 3 yuan and 6 jiao, and large-volume wheat was 3 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. A total of 3,000 bags were opened, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat market prices declined, and then the Liverpool closing was firm. The corn market was strong and powerful, and the prices for various purchases rebounded slightly. Everyone believed that, based on the situation of domestic miscellaneous grains, the market price should be high. The current market situation is excellent. If there is good news, it can rise.</p>
<h3 id="e212">River Rice Turns to Rise as Sales Increase but Arrivals Become Scarce <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for various groups suddenly became scarce, with only thirteen or fourteen numbers in total (totaling 2,340 shi of goods). Sales still appeared active, and grain groups from Qingdao, Yantai, and other places continued to handle more than 800 bags, and the situation was tight. Amidst this rising tide of commodity prices, the rice market also benefited. The prices of Zhongbai Daodao and Houxin Geng, among others, rose by half a jiao, and Duyangjian also had a few points close to a jiao. Only broken rice and Bianyuan remained unaffected. However, Xin Yinyuan also appeared tight.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty-five or six numbers of goods from the river areas. The sales of various goods in the market, such as Xin Geng, broken Geng, and Yaosui Baiguo, Xin Yangdujian, Chen Baiyuan, and various Jian types, were very active. Xin Geng was tightly priced high, and after the middle and secondary grades rose by two or three jiao, the market turned weak. In addition to the price increase for broken Geng, Xin Yangdujian slightly tightened. Chen Baiyuan's price rose by two or three jiao. Yaosui Baiguo's price increased by more than one jiao, and Yinyuan also tightened by one jiao. Xin Chen Pujian increased by three to five fen, and Xin Chen Kejian increased by more than one jiao.</p>

<p>Yangke Xian Rice Remains Steady Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for Yangke Xian rice saw a gradual calming of rumors, a decline in gold prices and foreign telegrams, and a stabilization of sentiment. Buying appetite has waned, and although sellers wanted to call for higher prices, most incoming sellers were insistent, so trading throughout the day decreased. The market price was similar to the previous session. However, Zhangzhou rice was welcomed by both inland and local parties, and both arrivals and inventories were low. Zhangzhou rough rice continued to rise by about one jiao, and Zhangzhou machine rice also rose by four or five fen. Xiang rice had balanced arrivals and sales, and the market remained stable. A total of 1,640 bags were opened throughout the day. Yang rice futures softened, but firms and stockpilers refused to lightly unload. The current Yang rice delivery is 120,000 bags, and only 5,000 bags are being sampled and sold on the market. Most others should be delivered to disposal accounts. As the market has little floating inventory, the market also remains steady. Yesterday, only 200 bags were opened. A total of 600 bags of Annam Geng and Siamese rice, which were transferred from Hong Kong, were opened. Prices were similar to the previous session, and sales were still only to the local and inland parties. The Jiujiang group has futures deliveries and has no purchase appetite for the time being.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market gradually showed signs of fatigue as spot gold prices fell. The guild's listed price for 24 Coarse Sand White Spot was 19 yuan and 2 jiao, for this company's goods it was 19 yuan and 3 jiao, for transshipment goods it was 5 yuan and 9 jiao, for Dutch red high grade it was 14 yuan and 3 jiao, and for ordinary it was 14 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 jiao, all at the original price. However, on the sales side, with gold prices fluctuating and undecided, people were wary and sales were sparse. The price increase was entirely driven by gold prices. The Taikoo Refinery's B mark was priced at 20 yuan, CW mark at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, DY at 19 yuan and 6 jiao, and HX mark at 19 yuan and 4 jiao, a price increase of about 8 jiao compared to before. There was not much import and export. The higher-grade No. 1 goods from this factory's cottony white were priced at 17 yuan and 7 jiao, with a small decrease of 1 jiao. No domestic sugar was sold. It was heard that the market for white sliced sugar was slightly active yesterday, with an increase of four to five jiao compared to the low.</p>

<p>Since the imposition of the silver tax, the foreign exchange rate has undergone major changes, causing hardware prices to soar. Compared to the market conditions on Thursday and Friday of last week, the increase has been anywhere from a few fen to several yuan. Fellow traders holding inventory have seen their costs increase invisibly, so they have universally resisted selling, and some are still unwilling to sell. As a result, the market has a strong buying sentiment and a tight supply. Therefore, all traders have a general sense of hoarding for profit, and transactions have become scarce. A survey of the more intense price increases is recorded below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e216">Method for Calibrating Multi-Stage Tuned Radio Receivers <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>丨The Use of an Experimental Oscillator丨</p>
<p>Once the tuning circuits of each stage of a high-frequency radio receiver lose their balance, its sensitivity, selectivity, volume, and sound quality will immediately be significantly affected, as mentioned in the article "Oscillator Testing Device" in Issue 79 of this publication. This article will further detail the method for calibrating multi-stage tuning circuits, so that readers can gain a comprehensive understanding.</p>
<p>No matter how complex a radio you construct, the tuning circuit of each stage is nothing more than a coil and a variable capacitor. Usually, the coils within the tuning circuits are almost always fixed, so if we want to calibrate a circuit that has lost its balance, we must start with the variable capacitor.</p>
<p>The multi-gang variable capacitors used in older radios were not designed to be perfect. In addition to a small trimmer capacitor attached to each section (see diagram T in Figure 2), there are no other adjustment settings. Therefore, during calibration, true resonance (Exact Resonance) can only be achieved at a certain point, and nothing else can be done.</p>
<p>Newer radios adopt variable capacitors where both the start and end movable plates of each section are modified into fan-shaped segments (Fan-shaped Segments) (as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). This eliminates the aforementioned shortcomings!</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the most common method for calibrating tuning circuits: First, rotate the multi-gang variable capacitor of the radio until the first fan-shaped segment is half-inserted into the stator plate (as shown by the dotted line in Figure 2). Next, connect the A and G posts of the experimental oscillator (the attached diagram in Issue 79; the positive terminal of the B battery is directly grounded, which is not very convenient to use; now it is modified as shown in the diagram) directly to the antenna and ground terminals of the radio using shielded wire (see description below). Then, rotate the capacitor C to resonate with the radio. At this time, the reading on the milliampere meter in the series-connected detection tube plate circuit (if a milliampere meter is not available, a sensitive voltmeter can be used instead) will immediately increase (the diagram shows plate detection; if it is grid detection, the meter reading will decrease). Then, use a screwdriver to push each section's capacitor's first small plate one by one (except for the first section C2), while slightly moving the rotating shaft, until the meter reading reaches its maximum (or minimum) value. At this point, the calibration procedure for the first frequency band (frequency approximately from 1500 K·C· to 1120 K·C·; there are slight differences depending on the manufacturer) within the tuning circuit is completed. The calibration methods for the remaining second frequency band (frequency approximately from 1120 K·C· to 840 K·C·) up to the fifth frequency band (frequency approximately from 600 K·C· to 550 K·C·) are similar, so they will not be elaborated upon here.</p>
<p>The calibration method for tuning circuits has been described above. Now, some points to note during calibration will be added below:</p>
<p>1.  The radio's antenna must be disconnected beforehand to avoid interference from external radio waves (but the ground wire must be connected).</p>
<p>2.  The radio must be placed on a very dry table, and avoid being close to metal objects to prevent capacitance effects.</p>
<p>3.  To avoid the radio from sensing the radio waves emitted by the oscillator and to maintain frequency stability, the oscillator must be installed in a shielded box.</p>
<p>4.  Similarly, shielded wire is used for the antenna. The ground wire is transmitted through the shielding material (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>5.  The screwdriver used to push the small plates of each section's capacitor must be made of insulating material (see "Insulated Screwdriver" in this issue).</p>
<p>6.  The volume control must be turned to its maximum setting.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Report on Ultra-Shortwave Communication Experiment <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yi</p>
<p>The scorching and bothersome summer has finally passed, and the refreshing early autumn brings much joy and pleasant emotions. Let's think about playing with ultra-shortwaves. With a moment's excitement, I tried this ultra-shortwave communication experiment.</p>
<p>The circuit I used is the Uitraudion type. The Uitraudion is worth recommending for ultra-shortwave oscillators among common and simple circuits. Furthermore, in order to reduce leakage loss, the plate voltage is connected to the end near the grid, with a choke coil RFC2 connected in between. In this way, the high-frequency voltage received by the grid is lower than that of the plate. The complete diagram is as follows:</p>
<p>The values of the other components in the diagram are as follows:</p>
<p>C1 = 50 ufd,</p>
<p>C2 = 14 ufd or homemade, C3 = 100 ufd</p>
<p>C4 = 250 ufd</p>
<p>R1 = 30 ohms R2 = 0-50000 ohms</p>
<p>V = RCA 30 MT = Microphone transformer</p>
<p>M = Single-button microphone Ph = 2000 ohms sensitive earphone S = Switch or homemade</p>
<p>Method for making L1L2—Use a sturdy small dry battery casing, and soak it in wax. Wind two turns of bell wire around the middle part, with a distance of 1/15 inch, to make L2. Then, wind two turns across L2 with a distance of about 1/4 inch to make L1. (See Figure 2.) It must be wound tightly. Looseness will inevitably lead to frequency instability. L2 can be rotated on C1 without needing to be wired separately.</p>
<p>RFC—Use two 1/18 inch diameter plastic rods or pen tubes, cut into one inch lengths. First, glue a 1/4 inch wide strip of paper to each end to create a raised object (see Figure 3). Wind 30 gauge wire onto it sequentially, with the distance between each turn equal to the diameter of 26 gauge wire: (wind with a 30 gauge wire and a 26 gauge wire together, and then remove the 26 gauge wire).</p>
<p>MT—It is best to use an existing microphone transformer. The author used a larger iron core low-frequency transformer. The secondary winding was removed, and 250 turns of 32 gauge wire were wound. The effectiveness is also quite good. As for the microphone switch, a plug-in terminal can be used instead. Unplug the terminal when not speaking. The microphone battery and A battery can use a ready-made 4 1/2 volt C battery. See Figure 1 for the wiring method.</p>
<p>All wiring should be firmly soldered with solder. The coil and tuning capacitor should be kept away from the RFC. The panel is best made of aluminum plate. The baseplate is made of plastic board.</p>
<p>The above components must be prepared in duplicate to make two ultra-shortwave radios.</p>
<p>When the author first calibrated, the B battery used 45V. It did not oscillate. Later, when the voltage was increased to 90V, oscillation only occurred in the shortwave section. Later, the capacity of C2 was reduced, and when 67.5V was used for the B battery, the oscillation became stable. Therefore, when encountering the difficulty of not oscillating during initial calibration, the wiring of C1 and C2 can be temporarily disconnected. The minimum capacity of C2 should be chosen to be sufficiently small. Homemade can be made with two bent copper pieces standing opposite each other. Nail them to a plastic board. They can be moved closer or further to increase or decrease the capacitance. Once calibrated, there is no need to move them again, just control R2. C4 is used to prevent C2 from short-circuiting.</p>
<p>For this experiment, two 1.5 zhang long leather wires were used as antennas, erected upright in the courtyard. They were connected to either end of L1. During the initial calibration, the distance was extremely close. The range of received signals was extremely narrow. Because a fine-tuning dial was not used, adjustment felt quite difficult. The strength of the signals heard in the earphones was also not very strong. Later, the distance was gradually increased. The sharp hissing sound of the received signals was still the loudest at a distance of one or two dozen zhang. This is probably because the range is too narrow, and the human ear cannot distinguish it for a moment. The furthest distance was completed at the homes of Mr. Yisun and myself from this newspaper. The straight-line distance between us is about 1/3 of a li. The music and conversation that were broadcast were received very clearly. The gentle Merry Widow was heard very softly in the eardrums. There was no noise. There was no attenuation. What a good range!</p>
<p>Because the autumn school semester has arrived, we have stopped our experiment. Although these two machines feel simple and unsatisfactory in terms of production, I dare to introduce them to comrades who want to try playing with them for the reason that they are "guaranteed not to fail". It would be even better if they could be improved to greatly increase their effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Simple Method for Repairing Broken Transformer Wires <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yongyan</p>
<p>After a transformer or choke coil wire breaks, it must be disassembled and rewound, or its two wire ends must be connected to a 220-volt AC power line, using the electric welding effect to automatically reconnect the broken point. However, the former procedure is troublesome and daunting. The latter is very dangerous if a short circuit occurs; neither is a good method. Here is a safer method that can solve this problem. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>First, find a "spark coil" (Spsrk coil. This item is often available in ordinary physics laboratories). Connect its secondary winding to the two ends of the broken wire coil; connect the primary winding to a 6-volt storage battery, and connect a momentary switch in between to control the opening and closing of the current in the primary coil. Once the device is ready, press the momentary switch to open and close the current in the primary coil of the spark coil from time to time. After several times, the broken point of the broken wire coil can be soldered together. If it still fails to solder together after several power-ons, you can add one or two more 6-volt storage batteries to make it 12 or 18 volts to solder it together. However, sometimes this method will not work because the gap at the break is too large, and it must be disassembled and rewound.</p>
<p>When this method is used, only a momentary current flows through the coil being repaired, so it is not very dangerous. Moreover, the hope of soldering together is greater than using 220 volts, so it is introduced.</p>

<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>Apart from reading, sleeping, and eating, I am almost always immersed in radio. Sometimes when I'm happy, I tinker with vacuum tube radios and try out audio. When I get tired of that, I go and play with crystal radios. The interest in playing with crystal radios is not as strong as that of vacuum tube radios. The reason is nothing more than that crystal radios have poor selectivity or insufficient volume. If the selectivity is good, the volume is not good, and if the volume is good, the selectivity becomes a mess.</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered a circuit with excellent performance. Not only is the selectivity extremely good, but the volume is also excellent, almost comparable to a single-tube radio. Now, I will record its circuit and the components used for comrades to study:</p>
<p>L1: 8 turns of 26 gauge enameled wire.</p>
<p>L2: 60 turns of the same gauge wire, with a tap at the 40th turn to connect to the crystal.</p>
<p>L3: 30 turns of the same gauge wire.</p>
<p>All three coils are wound on a spiderweb three-circuit coil frame.</p>
<p>C1, C2, C3: Three 0.00035 MFD variable capacitors.</p>
<p>C4: 0.002 MFD fixed capacitor.</p>

<p>(1) Radio Romance In Leicester, England, an amateur radio enthusiast named Wright is now crossing the Atlantic to marry an American girl he has never met. The matter is very strange, because Mr. Wright first obtained the echo of an American young radio enthusiast when he sent out a call from his self-built amateur shortwave radio station; therefore, they became friends through the medium of radio waves, and through this friend, he got to know Miss Fox in the United States through matchmaking. After several letters, they agreed, and Mr. Wright decided to set off for Michigan to marry Miss Fox. It is said that they plan to hold a wedding in the United States, and five days later, they will return to England with his newlywed wife. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(2) Wavelengths in Use The longest wavelength actually used in radio communications today is 20,000 meters. There are longer ones, but they have not been seen in use. The shortest is 1.5 meters. Shorter ones are still in scientists' laboratories.</p>
<p>(3) Vacuum Tube Production Until April 1934, vacuum tube manufacturers in the United States had manufactured a total of 130 types of radio vacuum tubes (only about half of which can be seen in Shanghai). The production volume of each type is thousands per minute, but for those made by Chinese people themselves, not a single one has been heard of in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="e221">A Battery with High Voltage <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Shudian</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of AC radios, the status of batteries in radio has certainly plummeted, but in small towns and villages, they are still unanimously supported by listeners.</p>
<p>There are four conditions that must be met when choosing a battery: (1) high voltage (2) durable voltage (3) long battery life (4) low cost. The dry batteries and storage batteries currently in use cannot meet the above conditions. Dry batteries are too expensive and have a short lifespan. Storage batteries are expensive to begin with, and the charging procedure is also very troublesome. A little carelessness during use will "sentence them to death." The author saw a type of battery in a Japanese "Intermediate Physics" book that meets the four conditions mentioned above and may be introduced to readers:</p>
<p>The battery being introduced now is simply a modified bichromate battery. This battery looks the same as a nitric acid battery from the outside, that is, an unglazed ceramic cylinder (i.e., unglazed cylinder) is placed in a large glass bottle. The cylinder is filled with a saturated potassium dichromate solution, and about 1/4 of sulfuric acid is added. A carbon rod is inserted into the cylinder. The bottle (i.e., outside the cylinder) is filled with a saturated potassium nitrate solution, and then a zinc cylinder is placed in. This step is completed.</p>
<p>This battery has a voltage of 2 Volts. According to the author's experiment, it can be used for three months. When the voltage drops, some sulfuric acid can be added to restore it.</p>
<p>1.  Dry Battery Revival Method.</p>
<p>When a dry battery runs out of power, you can use the following method to revive it. If the zinc and skin on the outside are not damaged and are in good condition, you can punch a few holes around the zinc skin and inject some saturated ammonium chloride solution into the holes to restore the power. However, the maximum power can only reach 2/3 of the original. If the zinc skin is corroded, you can put the dry battery in a bottle filled with concentrated ammonium chloride solution. Its power can be restored to half of its original power. (These are all the author's attempts)</p>
<p>2.  Protecting Hard Rubber Method</p>
<p>Hard rubber is easily decomposed when exposed to sunlight. Sulfur will precipitate on the surface in a thin layer and is easily broken. To avoid this drawback, shellac (Note) can be applied to the rubber. It is not afraid of the sun and is very beautiful: (Note) Shellac can be purchased at the Commercial Press Printing Office Library Department on Niuzhuang Road in this city, about two yuan per pound.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Radio Broadcasting in Japan (1) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua, sent from Tokyo</p>
<p>Like other countries in the world, the development of radio broadcasting in Japan in recent years has been very miraculous. In 1925, there were only three radio stations in Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya), and they were all privately operated. This was the budding era of radio broadcasting in Japan. In 1926, the Ministry of Communications, based on the British Broadcasting Act, adopted an absolute government intervention policy to assist in the establishment of the Broadcasting Corporation of Japan to manage the national and radio stations. The above-mentioned three private radio stations were also registered with the Association at the same time and were under the jurisdiction of the Association.</p>
<p>As for the so-called Japan Broadcasting Association, it nominally flaunts itself as a "corporate juridical person"丨a type of social organization subject to legal sanctions丨but in reality, most of the capital belongs to the government. The South Manchuria Railway Company, Japan Mail Steamship Company, etc. are all the same organizations, which are also a kind of far-sighted strategy of the Japanese government, because in this way, in the event that Japan starts a war with any country and is defeated, these many businesses can rely on the international law pretext that "victorious countries shall not seize the private businesses of defeated countries" and be protected, or at least, there can be some confusion without losing everything.</p>
<p>The Association's general headquarters is located in Tokyo. Its actual duty is to manage all national radio stations and engage in research on various radio businesses according to the wishes of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, its rights are limited, and of course there will be no excessive actions. Its regular expenses are very sufficient, so it is responsible for the development of the radio business throughout Japan. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e223">A Discussion on "The Climax in Literary Works" <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Laoyi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Huang Huaibai's article "The Climax in Literary Works" published in the Free Talk on October 2, the general discussion is: the climax of a literary work is like the peak of a mountain, and the crest of a wave. Those who look at mountains must look at the highest peak, those who watch the tide must reach the rising crest; and those who appreciate literary works must look forward to the arrival of its "climax". This is an inevitable principle. Otherwise, if the climax is not found and the center of gravity is lost, the reader feels uninterested and the work does not become a work.</p>
<p>The passages that Mr. Huang cited, Daiyu burning manuscripts in "Dream of the Red Chamber", the necklace of "Necklace" which turns out to be a fake diamond, and Bazarov's death in "Fathers and Sons" are all the "climaxes" in their entire book, there are many points in the full text, it seems that his logical connection is like this. We try to think about it a little, and we feel that there is still a place for Mr. Huang to discuss.</p>
<p>The so-called "climax", first of all, we have such a question, in literary works, does it refer to the center of gravity of thought? Or does it refer to the ending of the story? (These are two things, not to be confused) According to his citations, it seems to refer to the ending of the story, not the center of gravity of thought. We know that the center of gravity of the thought of "Dream of the Red Chamber" lies in exposing the crimes of aristocratic families, and Daiyu burning manuscripts is its ending. The center of gravity of the thought of "Necklace" lies in warning those who are vain, and the confession of a fake diamond necklace is its ending. The center of gravity of "Fathers and Sons" lies entirely in explaining the contradiction between the thoughts of two different eras, and Bazarov's death is its ending. The facts are obvious and cannot be concealed. If so, in all literary works, no matter what the content of the thought is, there must be a statement of the story among the various contents; and the statement of the story must have an inevitable ending, about this, it seems that there is no need to say it. However, let's think a step further: the meaning of "climax" in literary works seems not only to be the ending of the story; but to make the ending of a story more exciting, and even to make it as exciting as possible 丨if that's the case, we should have another argument.</p>
<p>No one denies that people who truly appreciate literary works do not necessarily focus on the story; especially, they do not necessarily focus on whether the ending of the story is exciting. As long as the author's thoughts are correct, the emotions are full, and the text and other aspects of the technology are successful, then in the reader's mind. In any case, they are always chasing down word by word in a tense mood. What is the stimulation of the ending? What is the image of the "climax"? He has no time to think about it. For example: when we read Tolstoy's "War and Peace", we only feel its magnificence, vastness, and all the boundlessness at all times, everything seems to be tangible and intangible, unconsciously leading the reader's mind into a kind of vast ocean, only seeing the boundless sky, the boundless water, the boundless mist, the boundless waves, and not knowing where they have gone themselves? At that time, can you still think about what its ending will be? What about the "climax"? Moreover, the whole ending of "War and Peace" ends so ordinary, so little is stimulating, and it is not easy to find the "climax". But can "War and Peace" be said to be not great? The situation of "Water Margin" is also like this, the middle part is moving, and the ending is uninteresting, and it is even more inconvenient to find the so-called "climax" of the whole book. So, can the book "Water Margin" be considered a valuable work?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if a literary work must have its so-called "climax". Then, according to what Mr. Huang cited, we feel that in addition to the ending of the "Necklace" story, which cannot but be completed with the confession of a fake diamond necklace to form the so-called "climax" of the entire book; such as Bazarov's death in "Fathers and Sons", and Daiyu burning manuscripts in "Dream of the Red Chamber", at best, it only added another emotional stimulus in the reader's mind! After all, it has nothing to do with the value of the entire book. Moreover, the burning of manuscripts comes from Gao E's sequel, and Cao Xueqin's 80 chapters of "Dream of the Red Chamber" do not see it; but can Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber" be established, and can it have value?</p>
<p>Therefore, we can know that because of the exciting endings of the books "Necklace", "Fathers and Sons", and "Dream of the Red Chamber", Mr. Huang's so-called "climax" was aroused, and he even advocated that a literary work cannot succeed without its "climax". I think that a literary work can have a "climax" (if it can be called a climax), or it can have no "climax". The former is like "Necklace", and the latter is like "War and Peace" and "Water Margin", etc. Therefore, the establishment of a literary work is entirely due to the author's personality and skills to distinguish its multifaceted success. The theory of "climax" seems to be close to subjective in nature, and cannot summarize the meaning of the entire literary work.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Witch Gorge <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Duan Weitei</p>
<p>Arrived at the Jialing dock.</p>
<p>He was mysteriously puffing on a cigarette, the smoke clouding his face, which was as white as lightning.</p>
<p>Looking at that face, I felt a surge of anger.</p>
<p>However, the whistle of the American ship "Qichun" docked on the opposite bank had already sounded.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to restrain myself and jump onto a rowing boat with him.</p>
<p>Entered the third-class cabin.</p>
<p>As usual, he was smoking, his left leg crossed over his right, putting on an air of being experienced and worldly.</p>
<p>I could only stare at this person, a companion I'd shared for half a month, an indescribable partner.</p>
<p>The river water howled and cried.</p>
<p>And so, we endured for two days – eating, smoking, sleeping, smoking, shitting, smoking – my mood completely ruined by this person's way of life.</p>
<p>However, the ship had reached the Witch Gorge, where the wind roared, the waves surged, and the apes shrieked.</p>
<p>At that time, the pale yellow crescent moon was shining on the mountainside, which was surrounded by clouds. We jumped off the ship and sat in a rowing boat, gently, gently, approaching the pier of Kui Prefecture City, a dock made of piled-up rocks.</p>
<p>I stepped on my shadow, and he also stepped on his shadow. Together, we draped ourselves in the silver羽衣 of moonlight and stepped into this city, which had been carefully glanced over with cold, sharp eyes by many dead heroes, such as Zhuge Liang, Li Xiong, and Wang Jian.</p>
<p>I sat; he also sat. I sighed deeply; he also let out a long whistle. By the dim lamplight, filled with a sense of nostalgia for the past and sorrow for the present, I asked the locals about the local conditions. He held the cigarette butt tightly against the lamp and also said something out of place, "It's a pity, this place is too quiet."</p>
<p>I felt that this journey had become completely theatrical.</p>
<p>I wanted to express some complaints to this person, but I lacked sufficient reason. I could only hesitate, bury my head, and return to the ship cabin with a feeling of utter defeat.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to turn around and close the door of the third-class cabin, a slender finger, with earthworm-like blue veins, clutching the half-smoked cigarette butt, a hand that I was tired of seeing, had already stiffly reached into that glass door.</p>
<p>I could only force a smile.</p>
<p>The smoke, the gleaming, lightning-like face, the elegant crossed legs, continued to irritate me without violating any rules.</p>
<p>"Friend! Have you read something like this – my travel companion?"</p>
<p>I asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" He was surprised, yet still leisurely blowing skillful smoke rings.</p>
<p>I knew that there was nothing more to be done in this situation.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Yichang, I decided to switch to the British ship "Shashi," a large Yangtze River steamer, heading towards Wuchang.</p>
<p>Stepping into berth number five in the second-class cabin of this ship, I took two steps back, cold sweat dripping from my forehead, I discovered an astonishing miracle.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was this.</p>
<p>He was already lying comfortably in the first berth, immersed in a sweet dream, a smile of contentment playing on his lips, also pillowing a newly bought pack of "Beautiful" brand cigarettes!</p>
<p>I was speechless.</p>
<p>In my heart, I was only shouting strangely:</p>
<p>"Drug dealer? Magician? Detective? ......"</p>
<p>I could only frankly blame fate, blame this unlucky stretch of water, what other way was there to avoid it!</p>
<p>I thought that this extraordinary story within the ordinary is something that every old traveler has inadvertently encountered.</p>

<p>— Te</p>
<p>New York! A noisy, optimistic, and melancholic city where people speak casually. It has cool cinemas, soaring skyscrapers, extremely extravagant millionaires, and paupers who lack food and clothing. It is a magnet for people from all countries who want to find opportunities to get rich.</p>
<p>London! Immersed in traditional customs. There, you can often see the King and Queen pass by the gates of Buckingham Palace in a carriage. In nightclubs or restaurants, you might suddenly find yourself sitting next to the Prince of Wales. On Fleet Street, you will bump into the robust and extraordinary spirit of Dr. Johnson. London is the world's clearinghouse.</p>
<p>Paris! Is cheerful, fun, and irresponsible. It is a playground for wealthy Americans. It is a gathering place for American girls, garment workers, perfume makers, cheap wine, good restaurants, and glib men and women. If you give the driver too little tip there, he will throw it in your face. (After you leave, he will pick it up from the roadside ditch.) Paris, its happy, thick crust, just covers up all the suffering inside.</p>
<p>If someone asks you: "Where are you going to live soon? London, Paris, New York, which place would you choose?"</p>
<p>New York can be considered the most comfortable city to live in. Its perfect heating and cooling equipment is unmatched anywhere else. People living in London feel very uncomfortable when they encounter extremely hot or cold weather, because there is no air conditioning when it's hot and no heating when it's cold in homes, restaurants, cinemas, and trains." Parisians do not like fresh cold air, so most of the indoor areas have sophisticated heating equipment, but the equipment for heat protection is completely lacking. In the summer, the sultry heat in homes and hotels is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In New York, the kitchens of ordinary people are almost all equipped with automatic dishwashers, but in London and Paris, only wealthy families can enjoy this convenience. Because New York has a very complete transportation system, fresh fruits and vegetables are often available year-round. In London and Paris, berries and peas are impossible to buy in winter.</p>
<p>Parisian bathrooms would make New York housewives cry. Once, I was staying with some people from the bourgeoisie, and I asked them, "Where is the bathroom? I want to take a bath." They all looked at me in surprise, and ultimately because I was British, they shrugged, forgave me, led me to a small, dark room, and left. I looked around, and there was only a small tin basin inside, which was not clean inside or out. I hesitated for a while and decided to give up the dubious pleasure of a bath, and then I came out.</p>
<p>Besides being comfortable to live in, what other advantages does New York have?</p>
<p>New York's telephone service is the most responsive in the world. Once, when I was living in Paris, it took me 20 minutes to connect a phone call to a friend on the next street. I once made a phone call from New York to London, and it was connected in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>New York women's clothing is both cheaper and more beautiful than in Paris and London, but men's clothing is more expensive than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>New York's dental advancements far surpass those of London. European dentists only have to say that they studied in the United States, and they can charge high surgical fees. This is their only way to make money. Because Americans are generous and charitable, New York's hospitals are well-equipped, which cannot be matched elsewhere. The hospital run by Americans in Paris never has an empty bed.</p>
<p>London is a good place to live. A famous painter said to me, "New York is a good place to work and make money, but when it comes to living, I prefer London. Look: its street names, like Royal Street and Lincoln's Inn, are very suitable for family life. As for New York's street names, like East 32nd Street and West 62nd Street, they are unbearably vulgar and make people feel disgusted." Many Americans only go to London for a short trip, but there are also many who live there for comfort.</p>
<p>Londoners are very careful in choosing friends, but once they become friends, they never forget them in their lifetime. Years ago, when I was in New York, many people became friends with me at first sight and were willing to form eternal friendships with me, vowing oaths that were extremely moving. Recently, when I went to New York again, only three people still remembered me. Some had also left New York and lived elsewhere. Many of the others acted as if they didn't know me when we met. Sometimes I would call them, and the reply was always, "Graham? I'm sorry, I don't recognize you!"</p>
<p>Londoners are calm and have few emotions (except before the King and Queen appear before the public or when a famous actress takes the stage). They are not like New Yorkers or Parisians, who can be as hot as fire one moment and as cold as ice the next.</p>
<p>The lives of Parisians are completely different from the lives of English and American travelers. They reluctantly greet foreigners who come to Paris for pleasure with a smile, but as long as foreigners are willing to spend money, they can go wherever they want.</p>
<p>Parisians are very hardworking, they get up early and go to bed late. The cooking in the restaurants is very good and very clean. Every night, gentlemen mostly take their wives to their favorite restaurants, only eat two dishes, and spend four hours talking. Parisians love music very much, and many cafes hire two or three violinists and a pianist.</p>
<p>Paris is more beautiful than London and New York. Places like the tricolor Champs-Élysées, the Place Vendôme, and the Bois de Boulogne are all unparalleled. The architecture in Paris is very orderly, and the rent is cheaper than in London and New York.</p>
<p>Parisians hate foreigners even more than the British. It is rare to find an Englishman or an American among their friends. Their personalities are wild and unrestrained, and they like to joke with people (especially mischievous ones), taking jokes as everyday fare. They believe that life is a kind of teasing created by God, and people should laugh and be happy; crying is the behavior of fools.</p>
<p>Each of these three great cities has its own advantages, and it is very difficult to choose one.</p>
<p>A very smart person once said, "Living in each place for one-third of the year, that's the only way to fully appreciate their advantages."</p>

<p>— Written by Langston Hughes, translated by Folang</p>
<p>This hotel has no attached dining room, only five tea servers besides Cindy. The head of these tea servers, old Willis, is often seated near the tables. There are two maids who prepare the food in the kitchen, they work in the mornings, an old servant does heavy cleaning work and scrubs once or twice a week, and there are those two small tea servers – one for the evening shift, one for the night shift. But those two tea servers have been there for a very long time, they arrange the hours that suit them. Charlie Natto, like Cindy, started at a very young age, but has grown up there. The other tea server, is really not a child, but an old man, he's been at the hotel since it opened, Cindy is very afraid of him, just like being afraid of the manager.</p>
<p>This tea server's name is George Grlek Mr. His uniform is tattered and dirty, but he wears it with honor, his walking appears as if all of these burdens in the hotel are on his shoulders. He knows how to do everything, where every item is placed, what every old customer likes. He can guess the tastes of new customers who have stayed here for a day before. Fawning to please white people, fierce and tyrannical towards his black colleagues, George is the head manager, second only to old Willis. He has to find a mistake in Cindy's work every day, until he likes the child, because Cindy never answered him back, or shirked work like many black children, as George said. After some time, the old man rarely bothered to check Cindy's spittoon and pay attention to the dust in the corners. However, if a person wants to work at this expatriate hotel, he only lets him be unhappy and obedient.</p>
<p>Besides being the tea server head's right-hand man, George is also the public bootlegger in this building. In fact, when he's off work, he hides his alcohol in the hotel's cellar, and Charlie, the other small tea server, sells it to the people in the rooms above who call for it. They don't do other business in this building, but this business is common. Some white women open these rooms,</p>
<p>They tell their customers to buy, and can get some commission from George.</p>
<p>Cindy has learned many tricks from working at this hotel for a long time. "You're really a mute little devil," Charlie constantly taunts him. "But you've only been a lamp for a while, you'll understand in the future."</p>

<h3 id="e227">When Will We See the End of Their Evil and Ugliness? <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— HY</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a copy of the "Northeast News Bulletin" at a friend's house, truly four captivating words.</p>
<p>Opening it up and looking down, the table of contents had two photos of the same size. The photos were on facing pages, and could be said to show two opposite facts. One was titled "May Our Anti-Japanese Heroes Achieve Their Aims," a group photo of the anti-Japanese generals Wang (Delin), Ma (Zhanshan), Su (Bingwen), and Li (Du) returning home and being welcomed in Berlin. The other was the title of this article, except that the author added a "men" character below the word "they" because there was also an explanation below: "A Quick Overview of the Traitorous Puppets of the Northeast Pseudo-Organization." The people in the photo were Puyi, Zheng Xiaoxu, Yuan Jinkai, Xi Qia, Zhang Jinghui, Zhang Hai Peng, Zang Shiyi... etc. Because there were so many people, adding the "men" character seemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Chinese people have a very bad habit, which is that no matter what happens, the approach taken is either to embrace the principle of "each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on another's roof," or to quietly wait for things to develop naturally. The great Chinese nation has fallen to its current state because of the spread of this bad habit.</p>
<p>What I want to say here is this: The reason why the Northeast has come to its current state is that we are to blame for sitting idly by, waiting for things to happen, and listening to the mistakes of natural development. Your clothes are stolen by robbers, if you don't want to chase after them yourself, and then blame the lost clothes for being covered in mold, it is not something to say that waiting to see how long the mold can grow. What's more, even if in the future there is a great person (in fact, there is none) who helps you chase back the lost clothes, the mold-filled clothes have already lost their original quality!</p>
<p>Applying this metaphor, we cannot help but disagree with the title of this article! Look at when will they do evil? "See when will they do evil?" If you don't want to clear your shame and recover your lost territory yourself, then these puppets will inevitably continue to do evil in the world. Even if they all unfortunately die of a great plague (this is not necessarily possible), there will still be new puppets taking the stage.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot sit and "see how long they show their ugliness," we should raise our banners to recover our lost territory, this is when their group of puppets will be destroyed! The birth of new puppets will naturally be even more impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Estrangement <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Estrangement is like a high wall, lying between people, stretching boundlessly. Estrangement, like a pile of wild vines, is planted firmly in my heart, gradually taking root as time goes by. Therefore, the feeling of estrangement becomes thicker day by day. Because of this, it seems that there is an invisible obstacle standing in front of me, separating all the people and things in front of me far away, and everything feels strangely unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Due to estrangement, a sense of indifference to the world arises at the same time, and even if I don't want to be alone, I can't help but be lonely. Estrangement will separate the closeness and sympathy between people, and replace them with suspicion and misunderstanding, leading to a gradual separation. This result is an irreparable defect. Unless estrangement can be eliminated one day, then this defect can be eliminated, but estrangement will always be planted forever, and will continue to increase due to complicated personnel matters.</p>
<p>My thoughts have been eroded by it, resulting in a deformed state. Originally, I had absolutely no hatred for the outside world, but now I don't know why I hate everything so severely. Especially people, whether they are familiar or unfamiliar people I come into contact with every day.</p>
<p>Often, in some kind of situation, some people talk vigorously, and I am also one of the speakers, and what he says may be something that I need to listen to quietly. However, I never have such thoughts. People say what they want, and I just think about what I want; even if it accidentally involves me, I still can't have any inner reaction, and I still pretend not to hear or see. I always think that what people are talking about is not me sitting there, but another invisible me.</p>
<p>No one knows myself as deeply as I do.</p>
<p>If someone comes to find me alone, my pain at this time is unspeakable. No matter how sincere the other person's expression is, or how intimate their words are, I basically believe that it is all fake, a hypocritical performance of smiling with the mouth but not the heart. What the other person gives me is just an inexplicable aversion, aversion, and more aversion. He is talking and saying excitedly, but I am doing evil in my heart. However, face to face, even if I don't want to listen, I have to put on a face that looks like I'm paying attention. I don't know how many times I've encountered this embarrassing situation. Every time I have such a completely reluctant interaction, the feeling of estrangement becomes thicker. In the end, I almost don't even believe myself anymore.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be living separately. Everyone's emotions and thoughts are also blocked by the high wall of estrangement. I have also reflected carefully, and this may be my own neurotic suspicion. It is not. A few days ago, I ran into an old classmate on the road whom I hadn't seen for many years and could be said to be very friendly with. I once again deeply felt the rare sense of estrangement. At the time, when I saw him, I couldn't help but shout out, shake his hand enthusiastically, and then ask questions about everything, asking if he had been living comfortably these past few years. I was expressing the greatest intimacy as before. However, unexpectedly, he had changed. He was no longer the person I remembered from a few years ago. I asked him a bunch of questions, but he only replied with a few short sentences, and his face was red, and his expression was very unnatural, as if he had met a stranger for the first time. What's going on? Finally, I invited him to pick a place to eat something so we could talk to our heart's content, but he also seemed embarrassed and declined with polite words, saying that he had something to do. After parting, I walked blankly on the bustling road, feeling like I was walking alone in a desolate wilderness. People are estranged from me just as I am estranged from people. We are all living our days estranged from each other!</p>
<h3 id="e229">On the Ship <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>A drifter is so easy to be, coming and going indefinitely. Last night, I was still sleeping uneasily in my old school at the foot of Han Mountain, twisting with endless melancholy; tomorrow, I will hurriedly step across Xiangzi Bridge again, board a car and drive to Shantou. Scraped together some money, bought a ship ticket, and left my hometown.</p>
<p>The ship set sail, my hometown was in my misty mind, as if it had sunk. My mind was absorbed by everything on the ship. My stomach was empty, but this chaotic and unbearable wandering life made it impossible to swallow food happily. The money was insufficient, and time was short, so I didn't even try to buy a side dish. It can be said that I was a little too negligent! I took two bites of rice and put it down. The ship was shaking so much that people who were already dizzy could not hold on any longer. I just lay down and quietly endured for three days and three nights. With great difficulty, the night passed. In the morning, people got up to wash their faces, eat porridge, and drink milk. I勉强 climbed up to take a look, still very dizzy, so it was better to lie down again.</p>
<p>The wind was even stronger, and the shaking of the ship caused a commotion throughout the ship. The luggage would jump on its own. The wind and rain blew straight at the drifter squatting near the toilet by the side of the ship, and everything was wet. I grabbed something tightly, leaned against the ship's wall, and endured the sour and unbearable things that were about to be vomited out, my face was pale and blue. The smell of urine and feces from the toilet was not something I had the leisure to enjoy. Dizzy, painful, lazy, sour, hungry, there was not even a place to lie down. Other than secretly crying out in pain, there was no other way! More painful than anything, a poor drifter on the ship! By the time the ship was almost there, the person already looked like they had been sick for several days. The thin face looked like it was pasted with yellow paper. When the ship entered the Wusongkou, most people packed their luggage, put on neat clothes, and waited happily to disembark, but this drifter scrambled to temporarily spread out the group of seats and lay down. When the ship entered the Huangpu River, the Bund was close at hand, and this was when I straightened out my tattered suit.</p>
<p>"Drifting into this big city!" he murmured lowly.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Drifter <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year before last, a strange man in tattered clothes suddenly appeared in our town. No one knew where he came from; however, most people in the town looked at him with surprised and suspicious eyes. After arriving here, he settled down in a dilapidated earth shrine less than half a mile from the town. When he came, he brought no bedding or luggage, only a small package and a bamboo flute, drifting here in a carefree manner. What's even stranger is that since he arrived here, almost a year has passed, but he has neither engaged in any business nor begged for food; and he has never been seen speaking a word to anyone. Even when people saw him, they would only glance at him indifferently; no one had the time to pay attention to him.</p>
<p>Since his arrival, in this small town, at the first glimmer of dawn, or on nights with a clear moon and gentle breeze, whether in spring, summer, autumn, or winter, one would always hear a moving, mournful sound. That melody, so melodious and so sorrowful, made people feel, in the deep of night or before dawn, as if they were hearing apes crying in a deserted valley, or a widow lamenting; filling the surrounding environment with a desolate atmosphere! This is the lament of a heartbroken person, the melody of a drifter's heart! Ah, he too is a pitiful person, lonely and desolate!</p>
<p>I detest this evocative tune, yet I love to listen to it; every time I hear this flute sound, it makes me think of myself, recalling the past, and I can't help but shed hot tears. I deeply feel that his life and mine are equally pitiable! Our fates are equally wretched! Our experiences are equally sorrowful!</p>
<p>One evening, I heard this sound and couldn't sleep; so I put on my clothes, got out of bed, and gently opened the door. At this moment, a round, cool moon hung high in the treetops, casting its faint, gentle light; transforming the natural world into a beautiful silver realm. On the azure sky, many stars twinkled, as if cheering for the moon goddess and wanting to conquer this dark world; the autumn insects in the grass seemed to have felt the sorrow of their impending demise! A gust of cool breeze struck my body, which was only covered by a thin garment, making me feel somewhat cold.</p>
<p>All of these elements combined to create a sorrowful world through that mournful melody. But I still followed the sound; walking into a cypress forest, towards a long tomb path. The sound grew closer, and I guessed that it must be coming from here. At this moment, I felt the air was frighteningly eerie; but I finally mustered up my courage and walked forward, and forward. Sure enough, on a small wooden bridge in front of the tomb, sat a person, holding a bamboo flute to his lips and playing.</p>
<p>However, as I approached the small wooden bridge, the flute sound suddenly stopped, and looking again at the bridge, the person was nowhere to be seen; I couldn't help but feel disappointed! Standing on the bridge, I looked around, but there was not a single figure. At this moment, I felt as if I had lost something important, and felt an immeasurable loneliness, emptiness, and sorrow before my eyes!</p>
<p>From that day on, this town, this tomb, this earth shrine, lost that drifter in tattered clothes. Never again, at the first glimmer of dawn, or on nights with a clear moon and gentle breeze, would one hear that moving melody.</p>
<p>"What is going on?" I have always been wondering...</p>
<h3 id="e231">The Sadness of a Clown <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child in a northern ancient city, walking past a piece of wasteland in front of my old residence at dusk, I often saw many people surrounding a person who resembled a clown, appreciating his "folk art." That person would bow his hands, making many funny gestures, thereby winning the audience's praise and having some copper coins thrown over. When the people gradually dispersed, leaving only him slowly returning home, I noticed the fatigue revealed between his eyebrows. That staggering and desolate scene was even more moving than the tricks he had just performed. At that time, I was still young and didn't quite understand the sorrows of life, but that experience, containing both comedic and tragic elements, constantly stimulated my weak heart, longing for an answer.</p>
<p>In recent days, walking around Stealing Chicken Bridge on Zhejiang Road, I often see people dressed as clowns standing at the entrances of several small shops, some even with painted faces, shouting in strange voices, hoping that people will come into the store to buy things. When I see such a strange image, I am tempted to stop. I and some other people who have stopped for the same reason crowd in front of the clown. The monster wearing a pointed hat and floral clothes then begins to speak, gesticulating wildly amid people's astonished exclamations. Of course, the scene is very comical. However, perhaps because it is overly comical, those who have already squeezed to the door all focus their attention on appreciating the clown, forgetting to go in and buy things. The hand-waving and posing become futile efforts. As a result, people disperse in a burst of laughter. To be honest, even though it is late autumn, some beads of sweat can still be vaguely seen on that clown's face.</p>
<p>I want to laugh, but those beads of sweat make me silent.</p>
<p>We live in the world, and there are many jokes around us. These jokes often stimulate us with novelty, making us laugh involuntarily. However, in the midst of the laughter, few people suddenly fall silent, lifting the outer curtain of joy to see the underlying essence of sadness. When we first see the clown, we should laugh two or three times, but after laughing, if we think about it seriously, we will find that</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>how much desolation this clamor contains, how much bitterness this buffoonery contains. The so-called clowns who amuse people are actually all caused by the ruthless lash of life. In the heart of the former clown, one wonders what is being pondered: an old mother and weak children waiting for food at home. In the heart of the latter clown, one wonders how anxiously he is hoping to preserve a glimmer of hope for his small business, which is in a critical condition, from this economic decline and sluggish market. This is just like a sugar-coated pill, with a delicious sweetness hiding a bitter medicine inside. People often forget the bitterness inside because of the sweetness of the outer taste.</p>
<p>In fact, what we see is so limited. All those prostitutes who force a smile in the dust, those petty officials who ingratiate themselves everywhere, those dancers who deliver flirtatious glances to people while enduring fatigue—aren't they all pitiful creatures who are tossed about by the heavy pressure of life, not even daring to moan?</p>

<h3 id="e233">A Gray Story <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>Another year easily passes with the autumn wind. After spending several years in the simple and difficult life of a primary school principal, I stepped into Shanghai's highest educational institution—the Municipal Education Bureau—and began working in social education. In the midst of complex work, I was fortunate enough to recognize some of the meanings of life and the sufferings of society.</p>
<p>This is a gray story, mixed with many tragic overtones.</p>
<p>The fact is this: The bureau director received a letter from the mayor, saying that there was an unemployed youth who had dropped out of school, in a situation of utter desperation, hoping that the mayor would help him. And this task happened to fall on me.</p>
<p>First, I read the youth's letter to the mayor in detail. Although the writing was so immature, his surname was Huang, and he grew up in Zigong City, Sichuan. His family was not bad, so he was able to study at Rong County Literary Academy for two years. Eventually, due to the devastation of bandits and soldiers, and the rampant extortion of civil and military officials, the lives of his family members were reduced to the point where they could not be sustained. He yearned for the prosperity of Shanghai, thinking that Shanghai could indeed give him a way out, so he began his journey. He came to this Paris of the East, but the Paris of the East, while prosperous on one hand, was also starving on the other. He began to feel disappointed, and he felt the danger of the future even more. He was already being invaded by hunger. In this vast journey! He issued a pitiful cry for help to the mayor.</p>
<p>He lives in Central Apartments, a small, dark room. When I rushed in, he was writing a letter, requesting assistance from people in society. He was already ill. I explained my purpose, and he immediately showed a frightened look. He did not expect that a letter would move the mayor's benevolence, sending someone to investigate thoroughly. He told me about his situation as written in the letter, and he described the situation in his hometown of Sichuan in great detail. Then I said to him, "Shanghai can't do anything either. You should go back. You have a family, you have parents, going back is much better than being in Shanghai, right?" He said sadly, "Going back is also a dead end! In today's Zigong City, there is no second way to live except to become a soldier or a bandit. What is the point of going back? Moreover, how can I go back on such a long journey?" Then, he turned out a letter from his father to him. He said, "My parents are also starving!" I read the letter in detail. The general idea was, "In this life surrounded by enemies on all sides, with insufficient food and clothing, I feel the meaninglessness of life. The family can no longer stay together. I don't know if you have found support outside?" I felt even more pressure, and I could no longer sit down. After comforting him with a few words, I ran out of Central Apartments.</p>
<h3 id="e234">A Melancholy Heart <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Niqi</p>
<p>To place a melancholy heart on a spring chair, closing my eyes to enjoy these two hours of comfort, this is a strange pastime, and I have been using hairdressing as an excuse for quite some time.</p>
<p>Autumn, a gray season, I walked on Avenue Joffre with a melancholy heart. With both hands in my pants pockets, I leisurely examined the beautiful window display of a store, and then I entered the hair salon with the sign "Electric Perm 3 Yuan".</p>
<p>The spring chair drove away that melancholy heart.</p>
<p>"Shave?" the person in white uniform asked me.</p>
<p>"Haircut." I replied. Turning my head to look in the mirror, I smiled; counting on my fingers, it hasn't even been ten days.</p>
<p>The barber began to work doubtfully.</p>
<p>"A comfortable pastime!" I thought.</p>
<p>Autumn days are short, and all the surrounding electric lights were on. When I put on my autumn coat with both hands, the woman in the mirror smiled and greeted me.</p>
<p>"The owner of that melancholy heart!" My returning heart whispered lowly.</p>
<p>The waiter bowed, opened the door, and the autumn wind was like an arrow, piercing my melancholy heart. I turned up my collar, watching the tips of my own shoes, and walked forward.</p>
<p>Passing by each beautiful window display, I heard a slight voice in my ear:</p>
<p>"Why don't you pay attention to me? I greeted you twice just now!" The owner of the melancholy heart!</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you," I shook my head, "I didn't think about getting a haircut today."</p>
<p>"This is an unexpected gain, right!"</p>
<p>"We seem to have said that before."</p>
<p>"Please forgive me, I went to another city with him, and I haven't been back for a month. Did you receive my letter?"</p>
<p>"I know. I didn't need you to apologize to me!"</p>
<p>Passing by each beautiful window display, I arrived home.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, I hope for the next "unexpected gain"!"</p>
<p>"You moved, when?"</p>
<p>"The day after I separated from you last year."</p>
<p>"Then you didn't receive my letter?"</p>
<p>"I received them all, thank you. Let's say goodbye." I turned around to take out the key to open the door.</p>
<p>"You are too cruel!" She almost cried.</p>
<p>I wanted to accept this unexpected gain, but my heart told me that she is the owner of melancholy, and you will never be able to sit in the spring chair and enjoy two hours of leisure again.</p>
<p>The door blocked the autumn wind outside, and I collapsed weakly onto the bed, with my melancholy heart.</p>
