<p>西歷一九二五年正月間、希氏招集熱心同志、共同力爲較難之工作、乃改組本黨、因乏於聯絡、總以團結爲是、數千兆外債、致有經濟與政治鞏固之時期、諸所政治、始與共和政體融洽、數年挣扎之苦熱心、因物質豐富、始而自退、希氏不顧一切抵抗、仍努力向前、西歷一九二七年黨部會議、始現實效、自此力圖運動、然仍不免於反對者攻擊、國家社會黨不得不有第二次之挣扎、</p>
<p>此項之挣扎、多受外人驚愕注視、因未巨眞象而有無限忿怒、彼等於本國内判斷事守、加以條件、但彼等不知英法工人不顧一切之學説、仍忠其本國、榮其本國、外人莫知德人自一九一八年後、分爲兩項、一項民人不達他人言、此事講明生死挣扎之激烈乎、一九二九年後、經濟之危機、扼守德國、而成奇局、失業者日增、政府無法救濟失業者、足見政治無力、失業之民、皆被共産主義所麻醉、化爲共黨者、其數目之巨、令人驚愕、國家社會主義起而慘酷反對共産、有勢不兩立之舉、倘希氏之主義、不得勝利、世人皆知德國必化爲共産之邦也、西歷一九三三年正月三十日、大總統委任國家社會黨領袖爲總長、國家社會黨始得最後之勝利、</p>
<p>最後勝利、德國人民因奪權、對於政府表示革命運動之熱誠、一日於波司丹敎堂内、年高偉人與青年英雄、團結於普魯士大王墓前、彼等知德國十四年中、對於世界缺乏聯絡、内部不和、而自破裂、陷於可歎之境、而今則異於昔日、新政府非基於政黨之仁慈、亦非經濟之勢力、乃根據人民公選之人、賦以無上德國歷史上所載之職權、由國内百業與昔日各界組成新社會、其工作當立一年限、或以十年爲一期、但感化多數德人勞工界之心不爲少、如於西歷一九三二年德國勞工紀念日所得之效果、可知之矣、然而爲表面之實效、工作非勞工一方面人爲之、乃勞心勞力者共同守職、服務社會、昔日希氏之社會主義綱領、被大多數不信之人所觀察、有人實望如此、有人恐此項主義爲官僚之招紙、愚弄大體勞工、希氏爲人民之總長、陳明其國家存立社會主義之中心、尤如於國家主義之中心也、因此工作者稱伊爲人類之大丈夫、於德境内一小邦、其鄉村城内反對異常、貶斥自由主義、農民爲有利之一班、故農民與城内之民、對於納税、相爭無息、國民社會黨、業已明瞭農民之加增特權、定有永久之革新、於酬恩節日、柏林本予處希氏演講其最深意之辦法、希氏云、國家社會主義、非根基於各人、亦非於人情、共原動力之中心點、乃國　且、而國家乃以精血組成之社會、各人有消滅、而國家爲延長無量、最高尚最誠實之人民代表、當選於此類之民衆中、能竭精力、由田舍之膏腴方是、世界已證明國民社會黨之勝利、與德國猜疑軍隊之恢復、彼等莫明希氏眞象、預期復讐之念、是時若以共同苦難條件爲榮幸、而根於互相尊敬平等、希氏則被共同苦離之厚望所引導、軍縮問題、致使世界各國起意見爭紛、因德人無此項之問題、最庸常之人能有此答覆、西歷十一月十二日已有此項問題、試問人民是否以軍縮爲領袖之方針、百分之九十投票者答覆云「然」、德國人民毫無意置備武器、與他國作戰、軍隊亦無野心、因經世界戰爭時期之虚榮、已無餘地也、德國誠願得了解與和解、但如領袖者云、寗願逼窘與壓迫、决不於將來簽訂條約、以虚榮爲榮之人民所當降伏者也、希氏爲歐洲和平起見、同民衆一致首肯、謡傳揚於海外、德國人民於少數專制之下、不敢高起聲浪、從速而過、人民秘密票選、新國會以此而成之、足證明反對此項國會、非服務各團體、亦非争决爭論、希氏願組織盡忠於領袖之人民社會、可助彼完成認定之大工作、卽德國國民之改革云、（完）</p>

<p>力言五年計畫之切要</p>
<p>（倫敦）　下院今日以四百零四票對六十票、否决工黨彈劾政府擴充空軍案、彈劾案之完全失敗、可證國會對於　内閣擴充英國空軍實力一倍之計劃、實甚贊助云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日下院復討論英政府在今後五年内增加空軍實力四十一分隊之問題、代理首相鮑爾溫答稱、英國在過去四年中增加空軍、爲數至微、僅增飛機四十二架、同時法國增加飛機二三百架、並通過一千五百萬鎊爲空軍改組費、意國增多飛機六十五架、今日共有飛機一千架或一千二百架、並籌撥二百七十五萬鎊爲改組經費、比國現亦將其第一道陣綫之飛機增多百分之三十、美國四年來增多飛機二百四十架、並决定續增一千一百八十四架、俄國空軍亦復大增、至於德國地位、則難以估計、但若德國得自由重置軍備、則其首先考慮者、必爲空軍、蓋德國常謂德國未有空防、欲求安全、必不可得也云、鮑爾溫最後稱、幕後情形、余自前不欲多言、惟此時局含有嚴重性、人苟非愚妄、不能忽視之、集合的担保、固可爲歐洲之最後保障、但若軍備在集合的担保中稍有價值、則武器必不可無適當之設備云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　下議院於本日通過内閣所提出之空軍擴張程序、該案提出討論時、工黨反對派曾提出非難政府之動議案、當經代理首相鮑爾溫加以答辯稱、苟就各項國際事件及軍縮問題一加考察、其艱難未有如過去十二個月之甚者、在此時期中、德國退出日内瓦、且在最近時期内、德國似無重返日内瓦之可能、至於歐洲各地發生之事變、尤其如奥國近事、更足證明到處均呈憂慮患俶擾之象、東歐互助公約、似尙少成功之望、繼述各國之航空國防、而尤注意於德國、謂希特勒制度、對於航空問題、極爲重視云、又謂、如國際和平當以共同安全爲其基礎、則英國固已履行其現有之約束矣、至於增加新約束、則非英國所願加以考慮、吾人所不能忘懷者、卽自航空術發明以來、疇昔之國界業已消失、苟吾人念及英國之國防、則已不在多佛海岸之懸崖絶壁、而在於萊茵河上蓋萊茵河今已成吾國之國界矣云云、繼述擴張空軍五年計畫之概要、英國目前有飛機八百四十四架、五年後將增至一千三百零四架、並擬採取新措置、俾在戰時保護平民云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　昨日下議院討論政府空軍擴張程序之際、代理首相包爾溫曾謂英國天空界綫、不復在多佛海峽之斷崖絶壁、而在萊茵河上云云、各報評論包氏此語、認爲一九一八年以來、英國説明外交政策最嚴重而最大膽之詞句云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英政府增置空軍四十一分隊之五年計畫、今日在下院辯論完畢後、工黨所提出之彈劾案、反對政府重置軍備之政策者、爲四○四票對六○票所否决、外相西門發言結束此案之辯論、謂政府此　項提議、並未受與他國談話之影響、政府之决議、最先在下院宣佈、此乃對於空軍問題各方面加以長期研究後之結果云、查英國空軍現有力量爲第一道防綫飛機八百九十架、政府擴張計畫、將使空軍在五年内增多四十一分隊、其中三十三分隊將列入國防空軍、故此後國内空軍將由現有四十二分隊增爲七十五分隊、其餘八分隊、將隷於艦隊、或歸國外調用、此項程序、已得内閣之最後同意、將使英國空軍力量與其近鄰之空軍同等、（三十日落透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c33">畢業後之職業問題 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>大學畢業後之問題。卽爲職業問題。學生數年來苦心求學。一旦達到畢業熟不歡欣鼓舞。表示其滿足。至一念及失業之痛苦。則又孰不憂心惴惴而大聲疾呼。據北平各大學生職業運動大同盟所發宣言。及其告全國大學畢業生書卽足充分證明大學畢業之多數同學。目前已深感失業苦痛。將來更不知將如何矣吾人在此國難日亟之際。對於一般有志青年。不能將其所學貢獻於國家。認爲當前莫大之損失。故爲國家計。應速予以適當之救濟。使各得展其所長。以合乎爲國育材之本旨。昨汪院長答覆學生代表請求之三點。果能切實施行。誠可爲一般失業學生慶。</p>
<p>惟吾人追念往昔。自停止科舉興辦學校以來。在辦學者方面。對於學生畢業後之出路。雖亦未嘗不謀所以安揷。然安插之道。僅從官廳方面着想。而社會對此敎育完成之人材。又多隔膜而不甚愛惜。以故迄於今日。讀書人祗知做官。羣向宦途中求生路。其實國家官吏之名額有限。而欲求官以糊口者無窮。於是政途擁擠。學非所用。用非所學。遂成爲普遍之病態。且宦海陞沉無定。人事變幻無常。一得一失之間。往往使有爲之青年。一轉瞬而化爲社會之病菌。是豈特失去敎育之本義。抑亦爲消滅人材之洪爐。此專從仕宦中求職業之誤也。</p>
<p>然則舍做官而謀之於國營各事業乎。但國營各事業。能有幾何。將再退而謀之於農工商各方面乎。夫農工商方面。似乎用途較多。範圍較大。應能收羅多數人材。以逐漸改進其事業。然而我雖號稱以農立國。而農業生産方法。以土地與人口分配關係。頗不易容納專門人材。而具專門農業知識之人材。更難於復歸農村。重度其類於原始社會之農民生活。故農業之不足爲大學生出路。已經事實證明。可以勿論。此外如工商業兩途。在今日正在工商競戰之世界似乎最爲需要。然中國旣受經濟恐慌之影響。又受外力之種種壓迫。卽比較稍爲向上發展如紡織工業。至欲維持現狀而不可得。更安有餘地以安揷新人材。其他各種商業。日見低落。一時亦難圖發展。且工商各業。皆具有人事淵源。自有其一定之範圍。又素重業務上之經騐。報酬較薄。而工作較煩。自與大學生之志趣。格不相入。以故大學畢業後之職業出路愈狹。而失業問題乃更見嚴重也。</p>
<p>從前我國之敎育。在學校時期。僅注意於智識之修養。然此種修養。是否充分。是否切合實用。學校當局。旣未深切研究。而受敎者本身更無選擇之能力。是以智識是否能應用於實際。猶待將來之實騐而後知。在學校求學時代。幾與社會隔離。一旦離學校而踏入社會。大有倀倀何之感。是則敎育當局不能不負其責任也。故吾人今日主張。一方應督促敎育當局。努力革除積弊。爲畢業青年開闢職業途徑。一方尤望畢業諸君。對於職業之選擇。亦須審愼。第一。須理解當前之事實。對於某種職業。是否具有恰當之知識。與推進之能力。更是否有深切之認識。第二在學青年。類多志大才疏。於事實每未能深加體察。一旦生活迫來。又值社會經濟動摇之際。其能不受嚴重打擊者幾希。以故出校而後。遭逢失業困難。更須抱定耐勞苦幹精神。能吃虧。能堅守。而不爲外誘。如此努力奮鬥。將來必有成果。第三。須注意小事。我國有爲青年。往往一受挫折。卽灰心短氣。意志消沉。一旦青雲得志。復又忘其本來使命。是應力圖自勉。從小處着手。切實作去。而勿務遠。大於個人旣可得磨練之機會。於國家民族。亦有相當補益。是則今日雖處窮途。而將來猶有厚望也。</p>

<p>新生活運動與禮義廉恥</p>
<p>各方對於新生活運動連帶而生的三個疑問，第一　中國固有的道德很多，何以新生活運動特别提倡「禮義廉恥」，豈不是掛一漏萬顧此失彼嗎？</p>
<p>人類道德的總檢討</p>
<p>（一）超時間空間的道德</p>
<p>（二）帶時間空間性的道德</p>
<p>（一）私德……家族主義下的社會之道德</p>
<p>（二）公德</p>
<p>甲·大同主義下的社會之道德</p>
<p>乙·天下主義下的社會之道德</p>
<p>丙·國家民族主義下的社會之道德</p>
<p>第二　禮義廉恥雖是中國固有的社會公德之一種，然實屬平淡無奇，而久服無效的古方，並不是舶來品的特效藥，中國病情複雜得很，可以拿這個古方當做救國萬應靈丹嗎？</p>
<p>（一）禮義廉恥確是中國有名的古方，然已往的中國，曾否照方服藥，如果藥是服了，並不是用這個方或是偶然兼採這個方，而任意加减，以爲别個主方之助，那不能斷定這估古方爲無效。　　（二）禮義廉恥確是中國固有的古方，不是外國發明的特效藥，可是在現代國家主義下的東西洋各國，他們維持社會的通用良藥：化分起來，其中含了禮義廉恥的成分就不少，外國無此方而有此藥，則中國這個古方，更值得重視。</p>
<p>（三）禮義廉恥能否當做救國萬應靈丹，應以藥是否對症爲斷，現在中國的病情，雖是很複雜，然推究病源，確是多因爲味禮義無廉恥所致，所以我們的主要丹方，祗有重用禮義廉恥四味藥，長期照服，不可任意加减，尤不可中西雜投。</p>
<p>第三　禮義廉恥爲什麽一定要從日常生活食衣住行之中表現出來，這是要從内心修養的美德，若專注重外部形式的表現，豈不是跡近淺薄易流於作僞嗎？</p>
<p>前一次講话，以「革命先革心，變政先變俗」爲標題，千言萬語，所講的都是做新生活運動的楔子，都是爲甚麽要做新生活運動的總説明。關於新生活運動的内容與其重要性，委員長蔣先生好幾次的講演辭，除印成册子外，又手撰新生活運動綱要和新生活須知一書，作一系統的闡明，旣詳且盡，用不着兄弟畫蛇添足的細説，這個運動發生之後，不脛而走，全國響應，可見釐然有當於人心，深合國民一致的要求，也用不着再來引申，可是綜合各方的評論，仍不免有連帶而生的幾個疑問，雖見解不能完全相同，然都是善意的商權，並非根本的不贊成，現在兄弟趁着這個機會，就把下列三個疑問分别解答，作一個「評論之評論」：　　第一·中國固有的道德很多，何以新生活運動要特别提倡「禮義廉恥」，豈不是掛一漏萬，顧此失彼嗎？</p>
<p>第二·「禮義廉恥」雖是中國固有的社會公德之一種，然實屬平淡無奇，而久服無效的古方，並不是舶來品的特效藥，中國病情複雜得很，可以拿這個古方，當做救國萬應靈丹嗎？　　第三·「禮義廉恥」爲什麽一定要從日常生活「食衣住行」之中表現出來？這是要從内心修養的美德，若專注重外部形式的表現，豈不是跡近淺薄易流於作僞嗎？</p>
<p>以上三個疑問，自從新生活運動發生以來，各方面陸續提出的，以下依照次序，逐個解答。</p>
<p>第一中國固有的道德很多，何以新生活運動，要特别提倡「禮義廉恥」，豈不是掛一漏萬，顧此失彼嗎？</p>
<p>中國固有的道德確是很多，孔孟講「智仁勇」所謂天下之三達德，懸爲造詣至高的標的。又講五倫五常，所謂五倫，是「父子有親，君臣有義，夫婦有别，長幼有序，朋友有信，」所謂五常是「仁，義，禮，智，信」。並没有專講「禮義廉恥」，在孔孟時代，「禮義廉恥」四個字，還没有聯屬而成一個術語。漢宋以後所講的「禮義廉恥」，亦係與「孝悌忠信」八個字並稱。「孝悌忠信」還排列在「禮義廉恥」的前頭，也没有顯出他的特别重要性，就是總理孫先生在民族主義中所講的，我們要恢復中國民族固有的道德，第一是忠孝，第二是仁愛，第三是信義，第四是和平。（有人説，這是八德，實在錯誤，我們祗可以説，忠孝是一德，仁愛是一德，信義是一德，和平是一德，合起來是四德。）也不是專講「禮義廉恥」，可見已往先哲所提倡的中國道德，有種種式式都應一律並重，委員長蔣先生在新生活運動中，爲甚麽要特别提倡「禮義廉恥」，可不是掛一漏萬嗎？我們要明白這個道理，就先要把所有的人類道德，分開類來，依其性質，加以一番檢討。爲説明便利起見，我要把他分類列成一個簡表，纔容易一目瞭然，大概所有的人類道德，大别之不外兩類，一是超時間空間的，一是帶有時間空間性的，而帶有時間空間性的道德，又可分爲兩種；一是私德，一是公德，私德就是家族主義下的社會最崇尙之道德，公德則再分爲三種：（一）國族主義（即國家民族主義）下的社會最崇尙之道德，（二）天下主義下的社會最崇尙之道德，（三）大同主義下的社會最崇尙之道德，明白了這些道德的種類，分别了這些道德的性質，那末「禮義廉恥」在諸般道德中所處的地位，及其在中國現在社會之重要性，就不詳説而自明了。</p>
<p>（一）超時間空間之道德</p>
<p>據我看來，我們古先聖賢所講的「智仁勇」，是一種超時代超地域的人類最高的道德，無論那一個民族，那一個國家，或是那一個宗敎，都應該以此爲極則，行之百世而不惑，放諸四海而皆準。儒家所謂「智仁勇」也就像佛家所謂「戒定慧」。「慧」就是智慧，「定」與「仁」的意義差不多，佛家重修持以求定，定之後，心中便無一物，不起一念，如明鏡高懸，可以燭照萬象，是爲明心見性的結果。儒家所謂「仁」字，從「仁」的作用説，當然很多，但從「仁」的本體説，也就與佛家之「定」定，是一個道理。孔子第一個大弟子顔回，年紀雖然很輕，可是聞道最早，他的最長處，就是「其心三月不違仁」，這就是「定」的工夫，做得很透澈。即大學所謂「知止而后有定，定面后能靜，靜而后能安，安而后能慮，慮而后能得」這種定的工夫，是心不妄動，人欲盡凈，天理渾存，只有顔回能做到這步，所以能成爲孔門最優秀的高足弟子。「戒」與「勇」相近，戒是克守戒律，人必有所不不爲，而後可以有爲，凡斷然不爲或斷然有爲之際，都得要先下一番决心，要下决心，更非有一種勇氣不可，「智仁勇」與「戒定慧」這類道德，表面上雖有不同，其實在本體上修養的工夫，原無二致，都是同爲超時間超空間的一種至高無上的道德。「未完）</p>

<h3 id="c187">私生活與理想（三） <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>答蕭靜娟女士曁羅方君</p>
<p>一個人的私生活對於自已的思想與理想都有很大的决定作用。中國文人素來有一種習氣，視個人的私生活是小節。這習氣流佈得很廣，影響也很大。不錯！私生活在以個人主義爲生活基調的今日，它是屬於個人的私事，用不着别人去管的。</p>
<p>但它决定一個人的成功和失敗，遂進和落後。</p>
<p>蕭君因爲數年的努力没有達以自已的理想，於是懷疑到自已的私生活、想作一次清算，這是完全正確的。中國有句俗話「健康的精神，屬於健康的身體。」没有健全的私生活，也决不會達到健全的理想的。一個人僅僅抱有一個高尙的理想，還是一個空想。你要爲這目標去奮鬭，這理想纔會變爲眞正是你自已的，纔能把它變爲事實。這一過程是奮鬭的連續，包括了你的「公」「私」生活，在你的全年生活中，在「公」生活方面你因爲受到社會的干督，墮落容易被人發現，反之，在私生活方面則不然，這方面的生活是你個人的，别人管不了的，即令是你最相親信的朋友，也只能在發覺某種現象张，輕微的進幾句諫言，至於你隠藏的部分，那只有你自已纔知道。並且，一個人對於自已的私生活總是有點優容的，小小過失，總以爲是無關大體。殊不知腐菌就發生在這脆弱的部分，它的繁殖之速，有時會令你自已驚異。</p>
<p>我們常常看見許多人的人格分裂。我們在名人自傳中，也同樣能看出二重人格的型象。尤其在一個時代的轉變中，因爲社會的矛盾反映到個人的生活，每每形成理想與生活的分裂。誠實，勇敢的人，他們每每知道自已的弱點，很以此爲苦惱。這已成爲了文學上描寫的主題。我們决不能被着眼睛否認它。</p>
<p>但是，這是一件怪事麽？不！一點也不足爲怪。我們在「論生活的矛盾」中已略爲提過了。許多人死在這矛盾中，許多人克服了這矛盾，也有許多人沉淪下去了。他們的勝利和失敗，都不是一朝而至的，都是通過他們的私生活，朝朝暮暮或由艱苦的自檢或由無形的腐蝕，漫漫達到各自的終點。</p>
<p>一個沉淪於紈袴公子生活的人，他决不能是污穢人的朋友，决不能做一個改造社會的戰士。反之，我們考察一個臨陣脱逃的兵士，他的臨陣脱逃必是根源於對戰爭性質的認識不清，平日私生活太安閑了，不能吃戰鬭的苦，被愛人，兒女，父母所牽罣了，被敵人的小利所迷醉了。這一切是他脱逃的根源。在未上前綫前就存在的。至於脱逃的行爲的發生，那不過是在於一點小的恐懼，就將它的行爲改變了。我們對於一個逃兵作何感想呢？只是感表的憎惡是無用的。假如我們是以軍人生活作爲我們的理想生活，專有了這種理想是不够的，專憎惡逃兵的行爲也是淺薄的，我們先得將自已的私生活的標凖降低到軍人生活不遠的水凖，我們要研究戰爭的性質，認明它的意義，對於社會與個人的家庭的輕重也有一番考量。我們應經常不斷的與不適宜我們的「理想」的生活鬭爭，一分也不要放過。我們應加强「認識」與奮鬭生活的量的比重，使我們一天天走近理想。</p>
<p>自然，我不是説促成一個人的生活進展純—</p>
<p>憑自已的心意作用，决定一個人的行爲是客觀環境。但人决不是機械的，他可有意識的能動作用。一個有理想的人應努力向自已的目標邁進。但他决不能忽略個人的私生活。</p>
<p>同時，我們也可以從各人的私生活而去考察一個尙不深知的人，因爲這里告訴我們的，一點也不會隠諱，這是眞的眞實。「不是垃圾不成堆」，純潔的東西投入垃圾箱内，那總是極偶然的事。一個人的精神腐業，墮落雖然有</p>
<p>雖然，私生活本身也是由於社會環境决定的。但在這轉變的時代，整個社會的動向已昭示得如此明白時，却有一部分人，在理想與生活反陷於極大的矛盾。常常因私生活而犧牲了理想，　這是何等可惜的事。所以，我們敢於向讀者旨定説，一個私生活不健全的人，他不配首理想，他决不能爲理想前驅，實現理想。但這决不是孔子先修身的説敎而是實踐的生活的指導。</p>
<p>在讀書的範圍内，亦莫不然，舉一反三，恕我不多贅了。最後，希望蕭羅二君收讀了這次回　信後的感想寫給我們。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>可是光緒和隆裕兩人所乘的大轎：却很寛暢地合佔着一輛車子，祗是没有一個太監敢大膽的爬上去，利用那些空餘的地位啦！大后的鸞輿，是更　氣了。　它是當用一幅絶大的黄布罩住着，它獨佔一輛車子，所餘的空隙，足敷六七十人居住，但有誰能去利用呢，照這種情形看來，在宫裏當一個太監，有時候不但不如犬馬，竟連一件東西也不如哩！</p>
<p>隨在我們後面的那一列兵車上的情形是怎樣，我實在説不出來，因爲我每次祗是遠遠的望見它，從没有詳細考察的機會。</p>
<p>歸納起來説，這許多車輛中，當然是太后那一輛車最有意思；其時它所代表的是整個的清宫，而乘坐在它中間的人，便是清宫中唯一的中心人物，也就是整個的滿清帝國的中心人物。</p>
<p>第十二章　列車上之小朝廷</p>
<p>太后的那輛車的前半部是欄成了一間小小的臥宻，它的地位雖是十分的狹窄，但它的式樣，和所有的一切佈置，却無一不是費了許多人的心思和精力所搆成的；所以不僅是美觀富麗而已，它的輪廓，它的格局，簡直和宫中的内寢，十分相類，眞是一所内體而微的寢宫。可是這祗指它的質和形而論，至於地位的大小，傢具的多寡，那當然是差得太遠了－因爲在這一間小小的臥室裏，除掉一張大床之外，－床是紅木做的，而太后這一輛車的本身的材料，也是用的最好的柚木，漆得又很光亮，儘可配得上伊的那張紅木大床。－别的就没有什麽好算是大件的傢具了。中國舊式的床，照例總有一副用以張掛蚊帳的架子的，太后的床上，當然也不能少。（九五）</p>
<h3 id="c225">鴛衾 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>貴族階級的享樂方法眞多，眞巧妙，單就睡眠講，彈簧氣墊，野鴨絨被褥，眞合着三笑彈詞的揷科説，周美人睡在王老虎的妹子秀英的綢被窩裏，身體一滑墮下池潭去似的。我見元楊瑀的山居新話説：</p>
<p>「余兒時聞先父樞密言，嘗於宋宫庫中，見孟蜀王錦衾，其闊一梭，徑過，被頭作二穴，織成雲板樣，蓋而扣於項下，如盤領狀，兩側餘錦，擁覆於肩，此之謂鴛衾也。」</p>
<p>我也曾有過這樣的理想，因爲孩子們獨睡在床上，常把被頭踢開去，尤其是春秋兩季，天氣凉而未寒，更容易踢被頭，着了寒氣，就得生病，想給他們特做一種被頭，用帶子縳住的。但是覺得太麻煩，太拘束，急切不便於起身，倘然把孟昶的鴛衾，改一點式樣，倒可以成功一種兒童最適宜的用具了。</p>
<p>衾本來有包裏身體的意思，所以蘇州有錢的人死了，要着衾，和孩子初生，包在襁褓之中一般的意味。一樣的衾字上面，放了一個鴛字，境界就大不相同了。但是蜀主和花蕊夫人，没有享樂了幾年，就分離了，只索得孤衾獨擁，花蕊夫人的熱被頭，給别人趁去。鴛夢不常，錦衾空在，眞是絶妙的宫詞資料呢。</p>
<h3 id="c226">牛車棚 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>河港的旁邊，矗立着幾株合抱的垂楊一裊裊的楊枝底下，蓋着茅亭般的東西，那便是牛車棚了。江浙一帶的鄉間，凡是種稻的地方，這類的牛車棚，差不多五步一崗，十步一哨，接連的蓋搭着。不但車水的老牛，可以在棚中躱蔭：便是行人們走路，嫌熱也可以棚中歇歇脚；半路上逢着雨，也可以在棚中躱躱。它的功用，眞和古時的「十里長亭」差不多。</p>
<p>那棚的構造很是簡單，四條粗拙的柱子，上邊蓋着箬笠式的稻草。棚中支着一根堅强的木柱，貫着一個很大的木輪；輪的齒上，繫着桔槹；把輪子轉動，桔槹隨着上下；河港裏的水，便跟着上來，打到田裏去了。堅强耐苦的老牛，帶上眼罩，背着輪上的横木，轉着，轉着，水便潺潺的湧上來。牛要偷懶而停頓，後面的鞭子，狠狠的抽上來。轉得它筋疲力盡，氣喘舌垂，纔得見田頭穗熟，塲角榖滿，供那都市裏的人們安坐着吃喝。</p>
<p>齊整而又碧綠的稻田；旁邊圍繞彎曲的河港；點綴着疏疏落落的幾估牛車棚，眞富含着畫情和詩意。我眞愛看，也眞愛在那裏徘徊，現在還不停的留戀着這種美景。</p>
<p>可是現在是機械的世界，墨守古法的農村，也隨着潮流而改用抽水的帮浦，四鄉只聽見馬達軋軋的聲浪，再畫圖般的牛車棚已不多見了！還有些鄉人，耕牛已宰割掉，田也不高興去種，所以那牛車棚也隨之而淘汰了！</p>

<p>魯先生上公園去溜躂，遇到施女士，起初是你對我看一眼，我對你看一眼。過了五分鐘，施女士微微一笑，擺動腰肢走了。魯先生忙跟在後面。施女士左轉右灣，魯先生也跟着左轉右灣。走過一家電影院，魯先生試一句「瞧電影吧」？施女士回頭一笑先跨上去，魯先生不敢待慢，忙買了二張票，檢最後排的位置坐下。電燈息了，電影開塲，魯先生和施女士，便開始互詢姓名，年歲，籍貫，學歷，職業，住址。電影完畢之後，一道兒上番菜館去進膳，膳後，魯先生送施女士回家。</p>
<p>過了一天，魯先生寫了一封緋紅色信封的情書給施女士，約伊明晚九時在某電影院相晤。到了下一天，魯先生早半個鐘頭，但趕去了，等了一刻鐘，施女士也來了。二人見了面，並不去看電影，却上點心店去吃點心談天。吃完點心，施女士站起來要回家，魯先生説，時候還是，上旅館去談一陣子。大飯店的電梯，載着這一對男女，上五層樓。茶房把他們引進一個小房間，便一宿無話。</p>
<p>三天之後，魯先生和施女士，用簡單的儀式結婚了。又是三天之後，施女士發覺魯先生已是有婦之夫，而魯先生也嫌施女士男朋友太多，雙方同意離婚了。</p>

<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>揚州自古稱名勝，在歷史上，在地理上，在詩文上，都有關於它的專門紀録，所以揚州的確是個特殊的地方。古代的揚州，和隋煬帝的揚州，歷時久，姑且不提，祗説那比較稍近前清乾隆時代的揚州，事事都可稽考；樣樣如在目前。揚州所以能够具有特殊意味，能够得人重視，最大原因，無非由於建築輪奂，風景美麗，這是無可疑意的。在現代曾經有人建議：將揚州也列入風景區。我記得古人詩説：「春風十里揚州路，捲上珠簾總不如。」又説：「春風舉國裁宫錦，半作障泥半作帆。」就憑這四句斷句，已足够代表揚州風景之美麗和偉大了！</p>
<p>在前清乾隆朝，皇帝先生一時高興，曾兩次下江南。當時是專制政體，是愛親覺羅氏的家天下，民衆被壓迫在獨夫横暴之下，處處皆要以皇帝爲中心，不過揚州的風成立，名勝造留，大半皆因隆乾而得，所謂「烟花十里，淵廻九折；」所謂「隋堤十里茵如錦，一棵楊柳一棵桃」，都由於揚州民衆要拍乾隆的馬屁，而成其爲烟雨樓台之人工美。想不到一個勞民傷財的專制皇帝，却成爲一個設立風景區的專家，而開後世建築的先河，這是多麽有趣。</p>
<p>在揚州北郭外，問乎小金山五亭橋之中，有座裏宇，名呌「法海寺」。它的前身，本稱做「蓮性寺。」在釋氏宗敎之建築中，大多數都充滿了封建思想，這並不希奇。「法海寺」當然也跳不出這個範圍。不過像法海如此一個小小寺院，如今更是荒蕪遍地，傾圮不堪，入目有萬種凄凉，佛果有靈，恐也不堪回首吧？相傳當年乾隆臨幸揚州，某一天泛舟游瘦西湖，正在「夕陽簫鼓幾船歸」之際。偶一回首，遥望着法海寺發楞，無意中忽然發出一句話説：如此一個湖上，可惜少一座寳塔，如果有塔，還得傍着法海寺建築一座錐，（即是喇嘛塔）那就點綴得十全十美咧」。</p>
<p>其時週旋於乾隆之旁的，所謂「護駕侍從」者，除掉一班公卿大臣外，還有一班外面受壓迫，内心甘謟媚的本地鹽商。有幸從龍陪輦，眞是光耀門楣，榮及祖宗，顧盼之間，有説不出的快活！旣聽得「金口御言」？以爲他動了「蓴罏之思」。就立刻靜悄悄連夜開工，合數千名神聖勞工之血汗和精力，費了一夜工夫，明天，法海寺旁，果眞多了一座塔。等到乾隆又去逛湖，早已看見寺旁這一截大蘿蔔式的錐。他不過打了一個哈哈，追問着何以造得如此之快？那些鹽商們三呼萬歲，齊聲回奏道：「聖天子百靈呵護」，却老早遺忘昨夜不知犧牲了多少血汗和精力，甚至還斷了若干人的性命。</p>
<p>如今是事過境遷，造塔的人與看塔的人，都已骨化爲塵，祗留得這一座速成建築塔，聊供後人憑弔！</p>

<p>自由談大衆語萬歲  吴稚暉　　—答曹聚仁討論大衆語問題的一封信—　　曹先生：好久没有領敎了。但是在許多刊物上常常拜讀大作，獲益亦不少。　　爲了文白大衆的問題，我也本想和和大家的興，揷説幾句。止因近年來對於現在的一部十七史，從何説起呢！倪雲林所謂「開口便俗」，他是恐怕俗了自已，不願開口。我是明知口裏落不出象牙，無往而不俗，不敢開口。因此遇到這樣熱鬧的問題，也還到底不敢作聲。承您爲了這問題，還提到我的科工問題，到底還不曾引申先生的盛意，　説幾句。就爲從前得了先生的敎訓，説我盼望别人從事科工，自已却不科不工，這眞是一針見血；從此我也就覺得刺刺不休的討厭，更加没有可開之口。現在又蒙先生將這文白大衆的問題下問，那我就把我心中要説的寫出來，博先生一笑罷。　　我總括的先説一句：文言一時難得死光，也是實在的。説他會什麽復興，再來代用白話，那是笑話。並且是鐵樹不能開花，同樣的可以肯定。汪柳諸先生他們忽然主張中學以後要側重文言，救人之意七分，衛道之意或亦有三分。因爲他們看見考試的卷子，及畢業的小世兄，實在文言太蹩脚，不適於有司之程式，那就於個人出路，完全艱難了。他們要救渡這班「出路先生」，所以望學校大開方便之門，給他們以出路的利器。這七分，是惻然悲憫，我想汪柳諸先生是胸無成見，是殉人的，並非護已的。所謂衛道之三分，則見仁見智，設想不同。他們偶然感覺文言這東西，可以連帶保持得他們希望之道，比較多一點；亦如白話家或大衆語家也相信能够連帶迷信到文體有關，况且止有三分，也可以對汪柳諸先生很原諒的。　　然而文體與衛道有關，我是不大相信。説文言中有道，何以總理的三民主義，竟以有把白話寫成的呢？説白話完全是道，何以白話家又常聽見擯斥某某派某某小説呢？可見得文言白話大衆語，止是工具。有容易普遍，或不容易普遍之分罷了。我們現在的局面，如合理的分配，即以學校而言，止能五成呌他進官塲，十五成呌他在學校敎書，八十成望他寫農工商。在中學時代，通通一百成，就要注重他的理化算數，而且要習科工，非兼習外國文不可。那末將容易的白話文，呌他能讀總理的三民主義，也就够了。到了高中，分出那二十成來，讓他兼習點合於有司程式的文言。到了大專，再讓他性之所近，去習法政文哲。其數目，也足够考試院取中，機關登庸了罷。還恐怕路是少，而要出的人太多。何必定在初中，即着眼有司程式，暗示以出路之所在，實則此路不通，社會上賸下多量的中等流氓？故汪柳諸先生存心救人，實乃害人。汪先生是不曾進過畜生道，柳先生是同我一樣，進過畜生道的。回想那一個童生，不是四書五經，强迫了讀的？文言當然是没有人敢對他發生問題的。然而每縣要取一二十個秀才，有幾個通順的呢？莊思緘先生常説：「考試的文章，是見得官，見不得朋友的。」比較起來，現在的中學學生，少數的也不讓當年的童年罷。其出類拔萃如柳先生者，當時亦止最少少數。今日學生中也儘有柳先生，所以不是文言才能也秀才的呀！終之，文言會成文學，白話也會成文學，大衆語當然也會成文學。但是，文言白話大衆語，有容易普遍與不容易普遍之分，當然白話比文言容易普遍，大衆語一定更比白話容易普遍。若一説到文學，恐怕文言白話大衆語，一樣的止是少數罷。其實即有司程式，及奉此等因，就算文言，也止要文言，普不要文言文學。就是白話寫得好的，也未嘗不能寫那奉此等因的文言。可惜一做文言，便馬上肉麻地要希望他懂得文學。於是文言的不通，因此而起。　　這一回文白戰爭，名作如林，多數皆可佩服。弟所　注意者有兩篇。一篇是尤墨君先生的「從中學生寫作談到大衆語」。他引浙江會考，題爲我所最敬佩的朋友，其中一則是文言，自來英雄豪傑之士云云，確有點古文觀止氣息。然尢先生要問於日常生活有什麽用？我對曰：只呌做文學，恐怕請這位先生去辦奉此等因，未必條理很能清楚罷。因此不要獨咎文言。尢先生於這會考，又引一則白話，有古之君子之交淡如水云云‘尢先生又批評爲食新不化的白話。然而化不化的原故，亦就在那里做文學。大家現在又要建設大衆語，打倒白話，恐怕就是白話文學闖下來的禍罷。所以胡適之先生方抵禦文言，呌人還要在白話文學努力。不曉得又一方面不爭氣的白話文學，做得好的，止有少數，正同文言文學，終是少數的一樣。不知不覺，人也白話文學，鬼也白話文學，也同古文觀止常坍文言的台一樣。而大衆語不客氣的又來聲罪致討了。因爲在工具方面説，白話自然優於文言，因其容易普遍。然而一到文學，便烏烟瘴氣，文言的好文學，如袁中郎的小品文，止併象牙塔裏人消悶，而白話文學的好的，亦不過供亭子間裏朋友排悶而已。其多數的怪物，簡直在大衆都莫名其妙，與古文觀止一樣。所以到了這裏，兄弟願意貢獻的：不要建設了大衆語，跟着便是大衆語文學。建得起大衆語文學，當然亦像胡適之先生把白話文學建成了白話。可是後頭還來一個打倒，是一定不免的。　　我這回尤注意的兩篇，其又一篇便是陶知行先生的「大衆語文運動之路」。他説：大衆語與大衆文（文是文，不是文學。文言，文言文，文言文學；白話，白話文，白話文學：大衆語，大衆語文，大衆語文學，就是大衆語將來需要文學，讓大衆自已創造起來，不要好像白話文學，還是幾個文言文學家改頭換面的代辦。）必須合一。在程度上合一，在需要上合一，在意識上合一。他主張符號是三管齊下。漢字要敎，注音字母要敎，用注音字母拼成大衆語要更敎。我看他的意思，並要提倡俗寫及簡筆漢字。就是有時措手不及，夾點同音的别字，又是他先生所容許的。我還容許他漢字，注音，符號，别字不够使用時，可以合璧成文。到大衆敎育普及時，由大衆中的能者來理出一個頭緒來；等衖堂裏的　三又需要有衖堂消閒品，再讓他們來創出大衆文學；不要又經今日的文人學士，鐵青了面孔，立文例，創語彚，好像大衆應當來受我們的欽定。看見夾了别字注音，嚴飭不許。倘若如此，也是受了傳統思想，與文言先生們的於古有之，於傳有之，也有什麽兩樣呢？文言於古有之，固屬可笑。白話先生於洋有之，必定要將一學而時習之，不亦悦乎，曰子一介紹給大衆，這就是白話要受大衆語的革命爲不可救藥的污點。文學的天才，是很少數的，而東施效顰，就有一刻板格式，加上了桎梏。所以大衆語要鼓吹文學，是很要當心的。最好遵從陶先生的意思，讓大衆自已來創造，不要代辦。　　且據兄弟猜想：陳望道先生等拿出這個大衆語的標旗來，大衆是縱的，指向多數階級説話。雖然也有意思，慢慢連到横的方面，一人説話，可以使四百兆大衆一齊明白，然而依我瞎説，恐怕陳先生起意，是不曾想一躍就到的。四百兆大衆一齊懂得的，是呌統一語，不是現在第一步急需的大衆語。倷伲也有大衆，阿拉也有大衆。倷伲的大衆，把倷伲的語文合一起來。阿拉的大衆把阿拉的語文合一起來。倷伲的大衆與阿拉的大衆，有了合一的語文，又互相合一起來。一種的統一語，還讓大衆來造成，是第二步。這恐也不是烏托邦，倷伲與阿拉，現在就常常通話，倷伲亦不倷伲，阿拉亦不阿拉，自有其不正確的藍青官話。藍青官話必是將來的統一語。多帶點北平話，或亦相當，然眞要應了陶先生「最好聽，願意學」才行。然而英美的英國話，都不能恭照約克省一道同風呀。一道同風，就是欽定的反面。我國一道同風的觀念，，不但入了政界，咬牢了雞巴，雞腿都挽不動，就在文學界，也是移動一毫，就要若喪考妣的傷感的。破壞統一之罪，在政界是頂大的罪名，在學界何嘗不是呢？好了，我是崇拜文學的，文言白話的文學，都崇拜的。可惜看人没有力量，止末裝小脚，是實可臭惡的，而且因而害於爾國，凶於爾家，所以敢下斷語，以答先生明問。曰：　　文學不死，大禍不止。　　好了，大衆語萬歲！若大衆語文合一了，寫點粗淺的科學工藝文出來，惠及大衆的飯碗，尤其圓滿。否則知識值幾文一斤，飢不能食，寒不能衣，灌輸大家抱頭痛哭之知識，哭得大衆骨瘦如柴，什麽革命禦敵，都不好辦罷！回想前日，你不好，打倒你，我來做，你來我來，還是那末一回事，根本弱點在那里呢，就是自已不科不工，對先生不勝其忸怩而已耳。好了，祝您健康！　弟敬恒頓首二十九日　　又：閻王不曾賦我以文學天才，我是一個「放屁放屁，眞正豈有此理」的大衆，有些脱字譌句，都望原諒。現在社會眞是發昏，好好一個劉半農先生，是聲普學大家，偏要拉他算文學家，算尊重他，不曉得正是駡他，正是埋没他，顚倒錯亂到如此，先生亦必大笑。箇舊廠  李喬　　—礦山通訊之二—　　「到了廠上，不能比在家裏時一樣了，你要記着：什麽都要忍受－譬如，譬如－。」　　在未到廠上以前，那個「走水」（一）的熟人就講給我聽過廠上的一切情形，并告訴過我應該注意的一些什麽。他是很關心我的，希望我能在廠上找得一個女人錢，好回家討媳婦去！但那裏曉得到了廠上來的生活的這末如此呢！　　這裏人人都興奮的一天只爲工作忙碌着，在早晨天還没有亮的時候，一個腰上綑着一根草索，頭上纒着給汗蝕透了的黑繞子，早已經把飯煮好了只等着人來吃的伙夫，揉着被柴烟燻出眼涙的眼睛，大聲的同伙房内沈睡着的人們呌喊：　　「起了！起了！……」　　這喊聲只是短短的三次，伙夫便算盡了義務似的不再理了。假若在這時還有疲勞得濃睡着的人，老板便會不客氣的從「貴房」（二）裏走出來，一話不説的提起滿滿的一桶水，劈頭潑下去！這樣，牠會使你如受到了一個霹靂似的，從夢中驚醒起來，周身濕淋淋的，趕忙跑到黑暗的天幕下去了。　　圍着一盞發出惡臭的煤氣燈，蹲在地上，才聽見清脆的報曉的第一次鷄聲，人們便在那裏紛亂的吃着飯了。　　吃飯，除了天天的那缽唯一的「老媽媽湯」（三）而外，還有什麽呢？可是，這比人參湯還貴重！早晨起來洗過臉的人是没有吃的牠的資格。這高規呌做「洗臉不得喝湯，喝湯不得洗臉」。因爲這地方的水，是只靠五六月間雨水落地的時候，掘一個方形的泥塘，積留下來度命的。天乾的時候，水是賣到一兩塊一挑，有時還會買不到。因此，就是一塘污濁得不堪的臭水，有着便溺；也會隨便用一點明礬放在裏面攪一攪，便當做飲料。　　可是，這末一來，瘟疫，瘡癩……等病，便在這人羣裏頑皮地滋生着。死亡，可怕的死亡，也不客氣的跟着到來！　　但死有什麽了不起呢？在這地方，一個人的死就等於一隻螞蟻被踐死一樣。一個砂丁只要一病，不但没有什麽醫藥，老板還不容情的不准留在伙房裏睡。於是，不得不露宿在伙房外，但伙房外是什麽一種境地呢？罡風日夜不息的呼呼地在吹嘯着，夜裏噑噑的餓狼聲，凄厲的從遠近傳來，使人不禁非常恐怖，在這樣的情况下，即使不被餓狼啣去，生命也會很快的完結的！　　死了以後，屍體的處置，是被遠遠的扔棄在岩洞裏，或荒蕪無人的山谷間。　　這樣的死亡和遺棄，在這地方是毫不會得到憐惜和悲憫的。活着的人的心只是放在工作上，整天挑着挖着，如彿要把這一隻隻光秃秃的鑛山剷除了似的，忙得連一口氣也喘不過來！　　有時，想伸一伸腰，抽口閒氣，嚴厲的一個聲音就會擲到你的耳朶裏：　　「　你媽的，幹不得，滾！老子這裏又不是……」　　滾，他當眞輕易能給你滾了嗎？假若你吃不了這種打駡或受不了這種勞苦，悄悄的逃了去，他會派人去將你尋了來，説是捲逃他的什麽東西（或者説是「月活錢」（四）），毒辣辣的將你吊打！直至氣息奄奄，要死不死的時候，沉重的一副大脚鐐才套在你的脚上。從此，使你永遠忠實的無代價的替他勞苦下去！　　因爲這是此地的廠規，官家不會來管你的喲！　　這樣的事，使我初去時的小小的心裏恐怖住了！我，一個「下班」（五）的年青孩子，常是這末揑着一把冷汗工作着。　　……一切動作，我都表現着生疎和害怕。沉鈿鈿的心裏老是這麽想起了遠離開的爹媽！　　在到廠上後的第五天，那個「走水」的熟人要離開我回家去了，我依戀的望着他，彷佛一離了他，我就會被老板吃去似的，我幾乎要望着他哭了！　　但是我不敢喲！　　（註）（一）走水，是指别地方的人到那裏去做生意的。（二）老板住的房間呌貴房。（三）老媽媽湯是用一小碗黄豆，研細，煮成四五十人吃的清湯。（四）月活錢就是指工錢。（五）下班就是下洞去揹礦。　　（附註）「鑛山通訊之一」載六月十五，十六兩日自由談，等李喬先生老遠的從雲南將續稿寄來，相去已一個月了。我來自東（十二）  星野　　半夜我從夏威夷村中出來，汽車夫在村外倫來一個椰子，送給我作紀念。他又帶我到中國人居住區域裏去看。據説：中國人在此勢力，已漸漸地被日本人奪去。我們回到船上，剖開了椰子，裏面只有一點乳一樣的流汁。椰子肉是白色的，　吃起來有點鮮藕和栗。　　太平洋舟中　　太平洋的航業，現在操在英·美·日三國人的手裏。代表日本的是日本郵船會社；這家公司，可以説是日本海軍的一部分。船價十分便宜，噸數比較小些。代表美國的是美國郵船公司，和大來洋行，老大來本是加拿大人，素有「太平洋老人」之稱。現在他已死了！他的洋行的業務，進步很快。近年造成兩隻很大的横渡太平洋輪船；一隻是胡佛總統號，一隻是柯立之總統號，據説這兩隻船的内容，可以和太平洋第一隻大輪船日本皇后號相比。英國方面，則以昌興公司爲代表，這家公司的資本，操在英·美·加拿大三國人的手裏。她不但做太平洋方面的生意，從倫敦到加拿大的航綫，是在該公司的掌握，而加拿大的從大西洋岸到太平洋岸一條做加拿大命脈的Ｃ.P.R.鐵路，便是該公司的本體。昌興公司在太平洋方面，雖然只有四隻輪船，而船隻的精緻，乃是遊客們最稱贊的。兩隻較小的亞細亞皇后和俄羅斯皇后，航行於溫古華與東京上海等埠頭。至於較大的日本皇后號與加拿大皇后，則從溫古華經夏威夷而達遠東各埠。日本皇后號吃水四萬噸，是太平洋最大最快的輪船。我這次坐這隻輪船從加拿大到上海，僅費十七多次天。　　太平洋船上的生活，對於不怕風波的人，是非常有趣味的。在這個四萬噸的巨大的浮城裏，你可以享受到一切近代文明人具有物質生活：圖書館，電影院，跳舞廳，球塲，游泳池，吸烟室，娱樂室，理髮所，洗衣作，酒店，大菜間，雜店等等，都很巧妙的安排在船裏。升降機上上下下，使人們忘記了身在海上。而且船上的生活，有的地方，比近代大城市中的，更要勝些。船上客人，旣没有怱忙的樣子，而且乘客們每日見面談話，吸烟，打牌，吃飯，都在一起，自然發生一種親密的關係。何况大家是這樣没有其他目的，人與之間，没有什麽物質或利害的隔膜，所以船上的空氣，乃是現代大旅館或消夏塲所裏所没有的。　　因爲國際貿易的衰落，横渡太平洋的郵船上大部分的貨艙的客艙，是留着空的。我這次的同船乘客，尤其是少數，水手數目，比乘客多過好幾倍，除高級船員以外，昌興公司的輪船水手完全是廣東人。乘客之中，黄的白的都有。頭等艙只有一個中國人，他還是一位昌興公司的股東。二等艙裏，中國人比較多些。在三等艙裏面，除了五六個菲列賓人同美國人以外，其餘的全是中國人。</p>

<p>電信特刊電界之聲推行電信到鄉村去  履冰　　我人見夫都市之繁華，一切通信設置之完備，社會使用，無往而不便利，但内地人民，因電局之尙未普遍，間有欲思發電而無從投寄，欲思通話，而無從接達，故僻處内地者，利用電信之機會，惟較庽居都市者爲少。電信事業，苟祗藉以聯絡通都大邑或重鎭要埠，則消息之能迅速傳遞，爲少數人享受之利益而已。電信之收效旣未宏，電信之用途亦未廣，以言便利民衆，未免美中不足。故都市電信，固屬重要，而鄉村電信，亦應發展，是則推行電信到鄉村去，實爲當局應行注意之點。　　推行電信到鄉村去，信之匪艱，行之維艱。展設長距離綫路，擴充多量局的，財力所限，旣非咄嗟可舉，則次一層之補救辦法，不外兩途；　　（甲）就已成幹支綫路，分别擴展，接通市鎭鄉颧，爲報話聯絡之用。　　（乙）未設報話局之處，由郵局代遞電報，免費送達。　　前者爲交部本年所擴增之報話營業代辦所，後者卽所稱爲「郵轉電報」是。有報話營業之代辦，則附近民衆均得通報通話之路，經郵轉電報之實行，則郵之所通，電亦能達，經濟便利，兼而有之。　　雖然，上述辦法，不過係一種補救，交部固未嘗以此自限。一俟成效旣著，業務發達，原有之報話代辦，一轉移間卽可成立新局，而現須郵轉電報之處，亦將因電信之擴充而减少。總之，覘電信業務進展之情形，以定隨時改善之計劃，實現之期，正亦不在遠也。　　從前主持電政者，率務近利，而鮮遠圖，目光所注，不出乎繁要都邑，内地商界，間或有要求展接綫路之事，惟不免多留難。今北舉措，縱尙未能遽謂澈底，但亦足見當局用心，固已實施其「推行電信到鄉村去」之辦法矣。計次取費的電話  曠　　上期本刊，曾載關於公用電話之商榷。電話之在我國各地，均按月取費，並不以通話次數爲標準，因是繁忙之用户，每天呼應频頻，而清閑者至視電話爲點綴之具，樂得供人借用，實際上所出話費，旣屬相等，次數愈多，則代價愈低，理想所及，恒使若干欲通話而以爲裝機不經濟者，每乞諸鄰近，借以通話，此實話局方面之損失也。查電報以字數計值，電燈以度數定費，彼此同爲公用事業，乃獨電話則否，寗非不平。考諸歐美，以電話呼呌次數，作爲納費之標準，推行至今，不乏其例，兹請言之，俾人共借鏡可乎？　　（甲）電話次數記録器－電話旣按次數收費，則通話次數之記録，所關甚重。若司機人員，對於每用户通話，均須逐次筆録，勢必職務加忙，影響接綫（此指共電式或磁石式之電話而言），故話局中特裝有一種通話次數記録器，形式頗玲瓏小巧，如電表然，其上有能轉動之號碼，祗須電流通過一次，號碼單位，亦隨轉一次。故如某一用户，一經呼應通話，該户之記録器，卽作一次之登記，不差毫釐。迨至月杪，可視其次數之總結，開單向用户收費。照此辦法，一次有一次之納費，可免用户無限制的通話，且亦可以取締借話。　　（乙）納費通話之裝置－尙有一種，在美國長途電話中，使用頗廣，卽所謂「納費通話」是。此法用諸長途電話方面，視電路之遠近，而每次收費，亦有不同。美國幣制，脸五分得，一角者，亦有二角五分者，話費亦就此三種之幣爲準，設如甲須通話至乙地，話機旣舉，司機人員答應之後，卽囑其將應納之費（五分或一角或二角五分）投入話機上之槽中，當金錢下落，觸動機械，司機人員，得聞聲息，並亦能知其是否誤投。迨知無誤，立可接通。又如所喚之用户，或以故障，未能通話，則經話局機械之動作，亦得將所納之費，自動的由話機下面之退槽中放出，俾歸還原主，無庸耗費焉。　　上述祗其大略情形，然亦可見海外諸國，對於電話計次收費問題，亦經多所考慮，因有種種發明，我國近年以來，自動電話，日見發達，而長途電話，亦展設甚多，應用機械，論次收費，似爲經濟所限，未能辦到，則在公共處所，添設公用話機，由代辦者按次收費，便利市民，增裕收入，未始非補救辦法之一種也。關於電報省費新章之解釋  記者　　交通部自頒布電報省費新章以來，在可能範圍以内，儘量實行電報减價，各界莫不稱便。但所頒各種省費新章，社會人士容或有未能完全嘹解者，仍有待於努力宣傳也。兹查有無敵牌鎭江工廠股份兩合公司經理張懌伯致函電政司詢問數點，經電司詳細解釋後，現將（張君）問（電司）答各項，探誌如左：　　（問一）發電於有電報掛號之處，如加收報人名，須六字計費。　　舉例一　一六八一無錫談拱辰　　照上例須六字計費，改用電話可省。　　例二　話六七一無錫談拱辰　　上例可以以四字計費矣。照此計費之法，用電報掛號，因多加一收報人名，須多出兩字之費，不如不用掛號，而用電話可反省費。　　（答）查電報掛號章程第一條載「電報之收報人得擇定一字，代替本人之姓名及住址。」故就定章言，電報掛號字樣，業已包括收報人名在内，如再准在掛號字樣之後，加一收報人名，卽成爲重複。更就事實言，電報掛號辦法，係爲往來電報較多之商家謀便利，而電話號碼代替收報人住址辦法，係爲電報不多之私人住户謀便利，兩者固並行不悖也。　　（問二）電報發往之處，當地電話，分爲數區者。　　例三　租界話九四○一三上海涂筱巢　　右須作五字計費，不用電話，而用詳細住址。　　例四　上海南市石皮弄建業里二號涂筱巢　　亦作五字計費。照上例用電話比用詳細地址電費，並不能省，而機上傳遞，則用電話代替人名住址者，傳遞之電碼，比較减省不少。納費之我寡，自以傳遞電碼之多寡爲比例，今乃不然，電碼傳遞少者，興傳遞多者一樣出費，於理亦覺難通。且電話代替人名住址，原爲省事省費，旣不省費，何貴有此辦法　　（答）查來函所述：　　「租界話九四○一三上海涂筱巢」須作五字計費，尙係舊章所載辦法。按照電報省費新章第四條及第九條之規定，應書爲：　　「上海話租界九四○一三涂筱巢」僅作四字收費。各國與我國電報價目之比較  益友　　電報爲民衆通訊之利器，世界各國中有歸國營者，如英德法日及我國是。有歸商辦者，如美國是。惟電報之收費，則不論官辦或商辦，必須合乎「低廉」之原則。蓋惟低廉，民衆始樂於利用，電報事業乃得成爲民衆化而有發展之希望。反之，如收費昻貴，則民衆無力發電，電報卽成爲貴族化，與便利民衆之旨相背矣。我國電報價目，論者多謂失之昻貴，但考之實際，殊非事實，試觀左列之各國電報價目表，卽知其詳：　　上表所列各國電報價目以每字論，德比美等國均較我國華文電報價爲高，以每電最低價而論，除日本外，幾無一不較我國爲高者。若以面積與價目爲比例，互相比較，則我國面積最廣而收費獨廉，是我國價目過高之説，可不辯而知其妄矣！　　雖然，論者或謂我國電報價目旣不高昻，何以電報事業至今尙未臻十分發達，其故安在耶？曰，我國電報事業之不能發達，其原因殊多，如歷年來受國内戰事及匪亂之影響一也，工商業之凋疲二也，大部分國民之缺乏智識（什九未受敎育），不知利用電報通信三也，官軍電報欠費每年數逾三四百萬元，收取無着，因此影響電政經濟，無法擴展四也。有此四因，電報事業自不易發達，若歸過於價目太高，非篤論也。　　（問三）　今發一電　　例五　南京坊口街弓箭坊（六二）號莊茂如先生　　計數水逾十五字，但因多添「先生」兩字，須照七字計費。其實加入收報人「先生」或「女士」稱呼，而收報人姓名住址整個計算正十五字或不及十五字者，旣未於十五字外，加增傳遞之電碼，僅加添兩字稱呼，似以不另加費，較爲公允。　　（答）查電報省費新章第十三條規定收報人之職銜，例如「校長」「師長」委員長」等准列入住址内計算，而「先生」「鑒」「勛鑒」等字，須列入電文内計費，良以職銜之後，大都不加姓名。故决不可少。而「先生」「女士」等稱呼，多綴於姓名之後，自不妨省去。至「鑒」「勛鑒」等字樣，原屬一種客套，其實際作用，在使收報人姓名住址與電報本文之間，劃清界限，惟按照電局定章，凡電報之收報人姓名住址與電文間，應由局台收發員用一雙劃記號陳開。例如「南京中山路（八○五）王誠　電悉欵已匯」上項隻劃記號，值機員應照予傳遞，抄報員遇此記號時，應將電文另起一行書寫。照此辦理，電報住址與電文之間，不致再有混淆之虞，故所有稱呼客套，均規定列入電文内計費，以免發報人濫用，虚耗電局人工材料。　　（問四）今發一電　　例六　東台西街慶源綢號張幼清轉張龍文　　右電未逾十五字，但因係屬轉交，須照九字計費。其實此電並未有電文夾入，因一轉字收報人名，亦須按字計費，似不合於人名住址减費之原則。　　（答）此點本司於訂定省費新章之時曾加鄭重攷慮，認爲不宜，因就電局之觀點言，凡寄由某甲轉交某乙之電報，其收報人爲某甲而非某乙，故來報回單上僅須由某甲簽名蓋章，至某甲之是否將電報轉交某乙，與電局無關也。　　（問五）今發一電　　（例七）　話租界九○○八六上海　　此電並無收報人名，亦照五字計費，電話多加一字，如「租界」「東局」卽須照加一字之費。今不用收報人名省去三字，費亦並不見减。加須照加，减則不减，是否合於公平之原則及减費之宗旨，尙乞攷慮是幸。此與第一例加收報人名「談拱辰」三字須加三字費作六字計算者，兩相比較，顯見矛盾。　　（答）查上項住址僅有電話號碼，並無收報人姓名或商號機關之名稱，核與電報省費新章第四條不符。電局如予照收，卽係不遵定章。澄清電路電話中各種聲音之辨識  李紹美　　近世電話技術之進步，一日千里。其利用各種週率不同之音波，代表言語，節時簡事，洵有足多。雖然，吾人習聞耳機之中，除聆得人工配置之聲音外，尙有天然之聲音雜諸其間，苦難辨識。兹不憚煩瑣，舉其大略如左，以供社會人士之參考。　　（一）呌號聲　Dialing　　Tone　　當用户使用自動電話時，取下耳機，先應聞得呌號聲，方能開始呌號。此種聲音，和而悦耳，卽所以代司機生訊「接何號」者也。若無呌號聲，必爲機件覓不着出路，用户應掛上耳機，逾時再行呌號。若仍無效，則機件必發生障碍無疑，用户應函話局修理。　　（二）　摇鈴聲　Ringing　　Tone　　用户呌號時，撥動轉盤，至末尾之一字，則耳機中應聞得有一陣一陣的摇鈴聲。此種聲音，所以表示已經接至被呌用户者也。若不及末字，卽有摇鈴之聲，或撥至末字，竟無聲息，則必機件發生障碍，應通知話局修理。　　（三）佔線聲　Busy　　Tone　　若用户呌號時，撥動轉盤，至末字，聞得有另外一種聲音，不甚悦耳，是爲佔線聲：卽代司機生報稱「佔線」者也。換言之，卽被呌用户線路，已先爲他户佔住，呌號者可稍候，再行撥字。　　（四）長途信用聲　Loll　　Credit　　Tone　　如某户積欠長途話費不付，局方可隨時將此種聲音接至該户線上。當該户呼市内電話時，並無困難。若呼長途電話時，則登記台之司機生，卽聞得有此種聲音，便知該户曾欠話費，拒絶接線。是以用户應顧全信用，不可存僥倖之心，以致放棄長途通話之權利也　　（五）長途接線聲　Lony　　Distance　Tone　　長途接線，照原則上言之，較之市内接線，應有優先權。蓋因市内電話，隨時可以呌號，若長途電話，則受種種限制，不得不予以儘先接線之方便也。設甲户由長途電話呼乙户時，而乙户適與市内丙户談話。長途司機生，可將市内通話，暫行停止，並將甲户接至乙户。至若丙户所通亦爲長途電話時，則線路上有長途接線聲，以區别之。司機生聞得此種聲音，卽知乙户亦係長途佔用。須候其談竟，再行接通。於是不致有冒昧摘線之弊。　　（六）障碍聲　Trouble　　Back　　當局方發覺某户電話工作不良時，試線生立卽舉行測騐。并將障碍聲，輸入該户線路上。設有欲呼該户者，則司機生卽聞得此種障碍聲，卽告以不能通話。上述係指人工式電話而言。　　（七）警號聲　Howler　　用户每有談話旣畢，不將耳機掛上，以致局内機件，常被佔往。局方如發覺有此類情形，卽由測量台放出大聲之警號至用户耳機。音殊粗劣，使人聞之不耐。用户應速將耳機還原，否則將被局方視爲絞線障碍，以致隔斷。　　（八）汽笛聲　Humming　　Tone　　吾人間有取下耳機後，卽聞得更調之聲音，如汽笛防。不獨妨碍談話，且滋疑慮。殊不知此係話機内電磁狀况反常或線路不良所致，應函局方修理可也。　　（九）窸窣聲　Hissing　　設某户使用電話，呼出呼入，均甚便利。惟耳機中窸窣作聲。此必耳機繩潮濕，或傳話器内炭精粒膠住，或線路上之隔電力不良所致，應函局方修理。　　（十）破裂聲　Cracking　　使用長途電話時，用户偶爾聞得一踏踏」之聲。此種聲音，係線條之接頭鬆弛所造成。如線路上有試線螺絲接頭Test　Connector者，尤應注意。斯項障碍之表現，時有時無，追求殊不易者也迅雷風雨必變  寄然　　論語上有句話：「迅雷風雨必變」。迅雷風雨，不祗聖人當之而變色，卽通信裝置，何嘗不受影響而發生變化呢。無綫電的電波，放射空中，因爲天時雷雨，雲中之電，擾亂放射之電，因此收受電波，不易正確。有綫電的電報電話綫路，都是沿途栽着的，自然界的電力，觸及綫條，通入機器，也很易使機件損毁，雖然有保安器擋雷器的裝置，但如雷電通過，力量過猛，也不容易得到安全。　　電報局中，在迅雷風雨之時，往往暫時停止通信，將綫路直接通入大地，機器隔離綫路，藉維機器的安全，這種臨時改接的辦法，非常簡便，祗須將所用的電塞，改換揷入卽得；不過經此改變接續，不啻　了「　　風雨必變　　　　講到電報綫路上；　　　　　裝置，每根電桿（都市綫路）或每隔幾根電桿（郊外綫路），都裝上一根地綫。地綫伸出於電桿之頂，沿桿身而下，埋入地裏。此外也有將地綫一頭，接連接綫（拉綫卽用以拉住電桿之綫）的。所具的作用，實在和普通人家所裝的避雷針一樣，欲將空中之電，引入大地，使其不致流入綫條，通入機器，求雷雨時之安全而已。　　雷雨時影響通電，上面已約述及。謀局内機械的安全，電信人員，當然充分知道，無庸多談。至於關於局外的，普通人士，遇及雷雨，卽應對於綫路充分遠離，更不應在電桿底下停立，或靠在電桿上，尤其觸及電桿的地綫，或握電桿的拉綫，更多危險，此係性命交關，實在是不可輕於嘗試的。電信統計一般  楨　　（三）埃及水線及無線電報統計　　馬可尼無線電公司與大東公司於一九三二年七月二十一日所締結之Tripartit水線合同，規定供給埃及無綫電及水綫與各國之連絡，一九三三年統計，尙無查考。但一九三二年之所得數字較之以前各年，頗具興趣。　　報類年份　一九二九　一九三零　一九三一　一九三二　　水線電　　六六三、八八七　六六三、　九四五　五九二、二二　四五六、五一四　　無線電　四四七、七五　四三四、零一七　四四三、零九一　五零二、六零六　　由上觀之，則一九三二年之無綫電路，因其價目各國均爲較廉，故報務容量，超過水綫也。　　（四）意大利電話業務統計　　意大利電話業務，於一九二五年劃歸民營，全國分爲五區，各區設公司一所。政府保留設立重要省際及國際綫路之權。自該五公司成立後。各奮其努力與犧牲之精神，以發展話務。一九二五年七月一日，意國電話有一五零，二三零用户，至一九三三年六月底，用户總數，包括總局及支局，達四八三，四六零云。　　此種普通增進，殊足以應便利用户之需要。下表所列特别業務統計，係以五年爲一度而計算者：　　特别業務之性質　一九二七、二八　　一九三二、三三　　用户不在　六、六六九　　五零、九零一　　校正時間　一二、八三三　五六、五二二、三五四　　喚醒用户　五、七七六　　八三、三零五　　火車鐘點　一二、三九二　　九三一、五五六　　運動新聞　一三、四六七　二、三六九、六一八　　召雇汽車　二八九、二五七　一、一五零、二三零　　普通情報　一一、七八九　一、七零九、一四三　　電報話傳　六九二、零八三　一、四二五、五三一　　電話代辦　八、七六一　一五七、六三五　　上表末行所列電話代辦一項，得適用各種業務，如戲院談話，野戰醫院呼呌，裝運包裏定單等。意國現與世界四十五國通話。下列數字，係表示電話總局計劃之推廣。此項計劃，自一九二五年實行者：　　國内電路　一九二五　一九三二　　架空綫路　一九二　一三五　　地下電纜　三九　二六七　　綫路與電纜之長度（ＫＭ）　五三、四七四　一三零、一一七　　國際電路　　架空綫路　三二　　三三　　地下電纜　　——　　七四　　綫路與電纜之長度（ＫＭ）　二、六六七　一六、五二八　　（五）英國水綫及無綫電之指數　　英帝國交通公司一九三四年首先三個月之報務指數，較之去年，頗呈進展，兹示如下：　　月份年份　一九三三　一九三四　　一月　六九·九　七一·八　　二月　七一·七　七四·七　　三月　七零·四　七二·八　　平均數　七零·零六　七零·三一半月消息  社友　　委託浙省話局代收電報　　自交部將浙江省内長途電話委託浙江建設廳電話局代辦以後，所有浙省原設之各報營業處，交部爲節省經費起見，已予酌量裁撤。同時與浙話局商妥，在富陽，於潛，餘杭，臨安，塘棲，桐廬，義烏，松陽，青田，象山，崇德，海寗，武康，安吉，烏鎭，華埠等十六處，由話局，代收代送電報，以便民衆。其辦法與鐵路電綫經轉電報，大致相同，卽話局代收電報，用電話傳至隣近之電局，然後發往目的地電局，又電局所收電報，發往設有話局之處，亦先傳至鄰近電局，再用電話傳至目的地話局，代爲投送。至價目則與電局完全相同云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Tang Youren Arrives in Beijing, Central Committee Members Listen to Report on Dalian Negotiations, Every Question Subjected to Meticulous Discussion <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Huang Fu's Intention to Resign Has Been Dissipated</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Youren returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou on the 30th, and arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 31st. The President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Zhaoming, the Secretary-General of the Central Committee, Ye Chucang, and other key figures in Nanjing immediately convened a temporary meeting at 4 p.m. to listen to Tang's report on the results of Yin Tong's trip. He explained in detail the extent to which the Japanese side accepted the seven-point proposal. After Tang's report, Wang and others meticulously discussed each question again, as a basis for future implementation. It is said that regarding the selection of local "political" and "police" officials in the demilitarized zone, everyone advocated meritocracy, hoping to quickly achieve results in governing the war zone. The meeting lasted for more than an hour before adjourning. A reporter visited Tang at his official residence. Tang replied that Yin Tong's trip to Dalian to discuss the urgent issues in North China with the Japanese side was deeply felt by the other party as Yin's attitude was sincere. Therefore, the Japanese side responded in good faith to the proposals, but the Chinese side should not be overly optimistic. It is important to have policies of careful implementation from here on out. Yin's return date has not yet been determined, as he intends to consult with Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways after he returns to Nanjing regarding railway matters. Rumors that the Japanese side proposed this time that Chinese and Japanese officials be responsible for North China affairs are completely inaccurate. After Huang Fu heard Director Yin's report, his intention to resign has indeed been dispelled, and he will soon be able to leave the mountain and return to his post. However, it is difficult to predict whether he will detour to Lushan before returning. Although Mr. Huang had been passive in the past, he never slackened in planning to break the stalemate. This attitude is what a responsible politician should have. Finally, the reporter asked Tang if it was true that Yin's briefcase was stolen while he was staying in Shanghai, as reported in the newspapers. Tang replied that he had heard of it, but did not know if it was Yin's. When he met with Director Yin, neither of them mentioned it. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu has been on Mogan Mountain for nearly two months, feeling overwhelmed by the entangled and unresolved issues in North China. Recently, Yin Tong went to Dalian alone to discuss the matter with representatives of the Kwantung Army, resulting in a concrete decision on seven matters. After Huang listened to Yin Tong's report, he discussed it in detail with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, and he believed that the situation in North China still had the possibility of improvement. His intention to resign was thus dispelled. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Political news: The North China diplomatic issue has the possibility of being resolved after discussions in Dalian. Yin Tong reported the progress of the Dalian meetings to Huang regarding the war zone issues, and requested Huang to come to the north quickly to take charge. Recently, Yin has repeatedly telegraphed relevant parties, saying that Huang has decided to leave the mountain in early August, visit Wang in Nanjing, and then transfer to Jiangxi. He is expected to arrive in Beiping around mid-August. Yin himself will come north within the next few days, and will first represent Huang in contacting various parties. At the same time, he will also proceed with various matters in the war zone. Yin Tong is about to go north to resume his post. Gu Mengyu telegraphed Yin, inviting him to meet in Beiping. (Special dispatch on the 31st) (Beiping) He Xiaoyi, Secretary of the Jimi District Public Office, said that the issue of suppressing Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone has been agreed upon with the Japanese side. Every Japanese or Korean person entering the pass from the Northeast must be registered by the Japanese side and issued an entry permit. If they engage in illegal activities, the administrative head of our side can arrest them and hand them over to the Japanese authorities for handling. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong, a councillor of the Political Readjustment Committee, visited Chaisan today. According to him, Huang has recently been telegraphing Beiping frequently to instruct on all matters related to the war zone negotiations. Today's visit to Chaisan was of a social nature. The issue of receiving Malanyu has been resolved, and there is no need for further negotiations. Yin Rugeng will go to Tianjin to contact the Hebei Provincial Government regarding the reorganization of the Eastern Tombs Preservation Committee after he recovers from his illness. The issue of the newly formed security force entering the war zone for troop rotation will be handled after Huang returns to Beiping. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, Liu Shirun, a councillor of the Military Branch Council, came to Tianjin from Beiping. After getting off the train, he met with Japanese military staff officers Kawaguchi and Ohashi at the Taihe Hotel. The two had some contact and planned to leave Tianjin for Mogan Mountain on the morning of the 1st to visit Huang and report on a certain matter. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaisan indicated that the Kwantung Army headquarters would inform the one battalion of the puppet army under Song Dingming stationed at the Eastern Tombs to withdraw outside the pass. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of receiving the Eastern Tombs, Yin Rugeng once met with Chaisan to discuss the matter, and a solution has been found. The Japanese side has decided to take responsibility for the withdrawal of the puppet army and other matters. Once all arrangements are in place, the Chinese side will be notified to take over on a scheduled basis. At that time, the Eastern Tombs Preservation Committee can be established. Before the new security force in the war zone is rotated, Yin Tong's meeting in Dalian resulted in a modified plan. As it is currently the season of green crops, it is not convenient to transfer troops. It must be implemented after the autumn cools down. Huang Fu has been telegraphing Beiping every day to instruct on the war zone negotiations. However, he has not mentioned when he will return to the north. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the handover of Malanyu and the issue of receiving the Eastern Tombs, a certain central figure said that the issue of receiving Malanyu is pending Japanese approval. Now, Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of Jimi, will continue to meet with Chaisan to negotiate the handover date, which is expected to be around the middle of next month. As for the issue of Eastern Tombs preservation, it has been decided to expand the committee and organize preservation measures. The plan is being drafted by the Special Office and is currently under review by the Hebei Provincial Government. The candidates for the committee members include Wei Jian, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hebei Province, Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Department of Industry, Yin Rugeng, Administrative Inspector of Jimi District, Li Chao, Magistrate of Xinglong County, Yin Tixin, Director of the Malanyu Office, and Pu Lun, a representative of the abolished Qing imperial family, for a total of six ex officio members. Yin Rugeng will serve as the director. The Chinese side will be responsible for the preservation rights and repair of the Eastern Tombs to honor the historical sites, but the abolished Qing imperial family can still freely go to the Eastern Tombs for worship.

<h3 id="e2">Puppet Army of Li Shouxin Has Been Disbanded by Japanese <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the second and fourth districts of Guyuan in Eastern Chahar, the puppet army of Li Shouxin was disbanded by the Sugihara Kotaro Unit of the 3rd Division of the Japanese Army on July 22nd and 23rd. Most of the unarmed soldiers were given severance pay and dismissed, and some were reassigned by Zhang Hai peng to be reorganized into a border pacification guerrilla force. The reason for the disbandment of Li Shouxin's puppet army was that a certain detachment of the unit repeatedly attempted to mutiny, most of whom were bandits reassigned from the Rehe area. The Japanese Kwantung Army learned of this and transferred the unit to the vicinity of Dolon while dispatching the 14th Brigade of Tanizaki Tatsuo to monitor them. There was no resistance during the disbandment. After the disbandment, the situation in Eastern Chahar was peaceful. However, scattered and unarmed soldiers of the puppet army were found in Guyuan County, looking quite disheveled. Each person was given 4 puppet yuan upon dismissal. Ding Shuben, the commissioner of Guyuan, has telegraphed the Chahar Provincial Government to report the locations where the puppet army was previously stationed, and the Japanese army has dispatched troops to temporarily station there. However, there have been severe floods in various places, and many houses have been washed away. There are many trucks, but the roads are still impassable. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The atmosphere of "bandits" has been very strong in the area of the Chinese Eastern Railway recently, especially in the western section. At a certain location thirty miles west of Hengdaohezi, "bandits" once again destroyed the fishplates on the rails, causing a freight train bound for Wuzhan to derail at that location. Nine train cars were heavily damaged, but there were no casualties among the personnel on board. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese have placed police organs throughout the Yu-Qin area, and starting from August 1st, they will reorganize the Shanhaiguan Police Station, expand its authority, and establish five departments: internal affairs, foreign affairs, commerce, general affairs, and criminal affairs. Many Japanese, Korean, and Manchurian detectives will be stationed to investigate so-called anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese elements. The Shanhaiguan Japanese Police Station has a branch in Qinhuangdao, with a police inspector in charge of patrol department and nine police officers serving. In addition, branch offices are set up in Changli, Leting, and Luxian, each with a police inspector in charge and four police officers. Chinese traitors collude with the branch offices, oppressing good people, causing our county's judiciary to be interfered with by the Japanese. Moreover, there are treacherous people who deliberately file lawsuits against their police at the Japanese police stations, and the Japanese police stations directly arrest and deal with the case, which the county magistrate does not dare to stop.

<h3 id="e7">Executive Yuan Approves Drought Relief Plan <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>And Resolves to Appoint You Guocai as Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guizhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 171st meeting on the morning of the 31st. Wang Zhaoming, Luo Wengan, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Shijie, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shuren, Cao Haosen, Gan Naiguang, Zou Lin, Qin Fen, Zheng Tianxi, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, Peng Xuepei, and others were present. Wang Zhaoming chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>(A) Reporting Items</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, telegraphed on the 26th to report on the flood disaster, proposing to send personnel to Hubei to investigate and quickly allocate relief funds for distribution.</p>
<p>(2) Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government, telegraphed on the 23rd to report on the drought and flood disasters, requesting the allocation of large amounts of relief funds to save the survivors.</p>
<p>(3) Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, telegraphed on the 28th to report on the flood disaster.</p>
<p>The above three cases have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance Service Committee for review.</p>
<p>(B) Appointments and Removals</p>
<p>(1) It was resolved that Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, telegraphed to request to resign from his concurrent position as Director of the Civil Affairs Department, which should be approved. You Guocai, a member of the Provincial Government, was appointed as concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department.</p>
<p>(C) Discussion Items</p>
<p>(1) Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance replied that he was ordered to jointly review the drought relief and rural construction plans proposed by Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as Nanjing and Shanghai municipalities, with the Ministry of Industry. The two ministries followed the order and instructed that the agricultural construction portion should be carefully reviewed. After examining the agricultural construction plans sent by the provinces and cities, most of them belong to long-term solutions. Among them, land reclamation, afforestation, cotton planting, rice and wheat seed propagation, pest and disease prevention, warehouse establishment, agricultural tool manufacturing plants, rural loans, promotion of rural cooperation, as well as tea improvement, promotion of sericulture, animal husbandry, and fish farming are all common matters that provinces and cities should handle, so it does not seem necessary to list them as special cases. However, water conservancy is a more important matter, and it should be regarded as an important part of agricultural construction in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. However, this water conservancy should not focus solely on irrigation due to the drought this year, but should also take into account the more frequent floods in the past. In general, after examining the water conservancy plans, some need to be jointly organized by the provinces and cities, and some belong to the counties alone or jointly organized. The required funds should first be handled as much as possible within the financial capacity of the local governments. In the future, such water conservancy projects should be regarded as the primary policy of construction in the provinces and cities, and should be given priority in the local budget. The construction authorities of the provinces and cities should always and everywhere carry out this goal in a practical manner. When the total budget of the provinces and cities cannot make ends meet due to the increase in water conservancy construction expenditures, they may submit a report to the central government for overall review and appropriate subsidies. Is this appropriate? Please review and instruct. It was resolved that (1) drought relief work should still be carried out as previously discussed, and (2) agricultural construction should be carried out as proposed by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>(2) Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior submitted a draft outline of the methods for training county administrative personnel, requesting review, approval, promulgation, and compliance. It was resolved that it be amended and passed.</p>
<p>(3) Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, telegraphed on the 28th, stating that Shi Bien, the Belgian Consul General in Tianjin, came to the government and stated that he was ordered by the Belgian government to award Xuezhong the Grand Cordon Decoration, and that the Belgian Minister would come to Tianjin on August 10 to hold the award ceremony. Should he accept it? Please telegraph for instructions. It was resolved that it be forwarded to the National Government for approval to wear it. (4) Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior submitted the budget for the special emergency flood control fee for the Yongding River in the 23rd year.</p>
<p>Please order the Ministry of Finance to allocate it first, and submit it to the Central Political Conference for review. It was resolved that it be passed and sent to the secretariat of the Central Political Conference for review and approval. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Kong Xiangxi Talks About Water and Drought Relief Issues <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Visit Chiang in Jiangxi Next Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi said that the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau aims to make up for the deficit with the surplus. Our country has never had accurate statistics on grain. I have sent personnel to various provinces to investigate the actual situation, so that a statistic can be determined first, which can be used as a basis. The situation varies from province to province, and each county is different. Furthermore, traffic relations and customs relations must be investigated clearly before work can begin. Otherwise, what is suitable here is not suitable there. Adjustment must also be made to reduce costs. In order to provide to others, it must be confirmed that a certain province has surplus grain for it to be suitable. At the time of purchase, it must also be kept secret in advance to avoid manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, the establishment of the bureau must also be carefully considered, and it is difficult to predict the specific date. The real difficulty of drought and flood disasters is in the spring season when there is a shortage of food supply. It remains to be seen how the autumn harvest will be this year. In short, the process of compiling official statistics is very rigorous and the amount of funds will vary depending on the scope. The flood disaster in the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan are serious, so emergency relief needs to be carried out. It has been decided to handle it based on local financial resources. After the authorities in the two provinces have carried out relief work, their situation will be investigated, and the central government will provide appropriate subsidies. As for the National Water Conservancy Committee, it will be established after the Standing Committee meeting. The two Standing Committee members Song and Sun are away on summer vacation, and it will be possible to establish it after the summer vacation. In the future, after its establishment, the other water conservancy agencies will be merged. The organization has been quite fragmented in the past. After unification in the future, there will be many conveniences in water conservancy. I originally planned to go to Lushan this week, but the preparation meetings for the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau and the Central Bank Trust are still being held in Nanjing, so I have to preside over them. I will go there next week instead. It is not certain whether President Wang will go with me. This is to comply with Chairman Chiang's telegram order to meet and talk, and there is no meeting. The establishment of the Trust Bureau will be after the summer vacation. The establishment of checkpoints in the five ports of the Great Wall has actually been done separately for a long time, and the reports are quite inaccurate. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Severe Flooding in Suiyuan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Area of Flooding Extends Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Rural Transportation Mostly Relies on Boats</p>
<p>It Is Difficult for the Ping-Sui Railway to Fully Operate</p>
<p>The Hetao Area Suffers from Severe Drought and the Autumn Harvest Is Completely Hopeless</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Guihua: The flooding in Suiyuan is severe. Counties such as Saheqi, Tuoketuo, Helin, Fengzhen, and Liangcheng have reported disasters one after another. Most counties have suffered from hail, continuous rain, and flash floods, and countless houses and fields have been destroyed. People and livestock have been injured or killed. The area of flooding extends throughout the province. Transportation in many villages relies entirely on boats. There is no grain left. The Suiyuan Provincial Government has requested relief from the central government on the one hand, and urgently conducted a survey on the other hand. In July, there were few clear days. There was heavy rain again on the night of the 29th. The Ping-Sui train also encountered obstacles due to flash floods. However, the Hetao area suffers from severe drought. The canal water is dry, forming an unprecedented drought. The autumn harvest is completely hopeless, and reclamation has also been affected. It is reported that Fu Zuoyi issued an urgent order to various counties to conduct a careful survey and report as soon as possible in order to provide relief. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There have been showers along the Ping-Sui Railway. The roadbed near Qixiaying was washed away again yesterday by the water, with a break of half a mile. A wooden bridge was also washed away. The Ping-Bao express train, which departed from Beiping on the 30th, originally planned to advance from Zhuozishan to Pingdiquan, but temporarily stopped due to reports of flooding. Due to frequent natural disasters and the maintenance by manpower, the railway bureau feels exhausted. The original plan to fully restore traffic on the 1st has been disrupted due to continuous damage at the repair sites. It has been decided to temporarily maintain the current situation and operate in sections. After the weather stabilizes, the date for full railway operation will be determined.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota submitted a compromise plan to the Soviet Russian representative on the 23rd of this month for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway in order to resolve the year-long Russian-"Manchukuo" issue. The "Manchukuo" side has already accepted this plan, but according to the Soviet ambassador Yurenev's response to Foreign Minister Hirota on the 30th, the Russian side rejected the plan, which greatly disappointed the Foreign Minister. The negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway have thus encountered the final hurdle. If the Russian side does not change its attitude, the negotiations will collapse. (Japan Union dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet side has rejected Foreign Minister Hirota's final proposal regarding the transfer of the Eastern Railway and submitted a counter-proposal from the Soviet side, which is only a slight concession from its previous demands. Foreign Minister Hirota feels quite displeased with this attitude of Russia. Foreign Minister Hirota wanted to take the opportunity of the establishment of the Eastern Railway negotiations to launch the peaceful maintenance work between the three countries of the Soviet Union, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Because the Soviet attitude is still insincere, he strongly urged the Soviet ambassador to reconsider.

<h3 id="e17">German Interior Minister Describes Hitler's Policies <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(Kokumin News Agency, Berlin Correspondence, July 23rd)</p>
<p>For the past thirteen or fourteen years, various conflicts have occurred in countries around the world, leaving them no time to attend to republican systems. National Socialism seemed to have already begun, but it went unnoticed. Recently, the world has come to realize that this concept is a prerequisite for historical evolution and the hope of the nation. It can be seen that the day National Socialism began its activities was the day the German people's future started. In the past, the National Socialist Party struggled painfully, experiencing failures and tensions, all in preparation for today. The November republican parliamentary battle was maintained by volunteer soldiers, barely avoiding disaster, with the intention of those who overcame the Great War. The republican system vaguely took shape, with reconstruction work based on individual efforts, not ideology. The Weimar province provided much support for the roots of the republican system. The foreign policy born of weakness and abandonment had already made endless concessions. Domestically, politics were corrupt and decaying, and party disputes were incessant. Hitler established a base in Munich and embraced resistance. In November, the party and the province increased the number of comrades, largely due to Hitler's efforts. When he first convened a meeting in Erbergedei, Hitler reviewed the veterans and newly recruited soldiers. They happily looked forward to returning to the German capital, Berlin, but the attempted seizure of power failed on November 9, 1923. The National Socialist movement and its leader, Hitler, were clearly at a disadvantage. Afterwards, would National Socialism be a phenomenon of rapid warfare and the expansion of war, or would the seeds sown by Hitler bear fruit? The world must understand that after the failure, being trapped for several years proved to be a period of preparation for the ideal. Hitler deeply knew that he had to change his policies to achieve practical results. Subjugating this legal system with speed and force would not succeed. To succeed, one must be guided by noble ideals. The era of wrestling and competition had arrived. He had to overcome the national psychology to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Around January 1925, Hitler summoned enthusiastic comrades to work together on more difficult tasks, namely reorganizing the party. Due to a lack of communication, unity was paramount. Trillions of foreign debts led to a period of economic and political consolidation. All political affairs began to harmonize with the republican system. The suffering and enthusiasm of years of struggle began to recede due to material abundance. Hitler resisted everything and continued to work hard. In 1927, the party congress began to see practical results. From then on, he worked hard to promote the movement, but he could not avoid attacks from opponents. The National Socialist Party had to undergo a second struggle.</p>
<p>This struggle was mostly watched with astonishment by outsiders, who were filled with endless anger because they did not understand the true situation. They judged matters within their own countries, adding conditions. But they did not know that British and French workers, regardless of any doctrine, remained loyal to their countries and honored them. Outsiders did not know that Germans, since 1918, had been divided into two groups, one group of people who could not understand the words of others. Does this explain the intensity of the life-and-death struggle? After 1929, the economic crisis gripped Germany and formed a strange situation. The number of unemployed people increased daily. The government was unable to provide relief to the unemployed, demonstrating political impotence. The unemployed people were all anesthetized by communism, turning into communists in numbers that were astonishing. National Socialism rose up to cruelly oppose communism, taking an irreconcilable stance. If Hitler's doctrine did not triumph, everyone knew that Germany would inevitably become a communist country. On January 30, 1933, the president appointed the leader of the National Socialist Party as Chancellor. The National Socialist Party finally achieved its final victory.</p>
<p>In the final victory, the German people showed revolutionary enthusiasm for the government due to the seizure of power. One day, inside the Potsdam Church, an elderly, great man and a young hero united before the tomb of the Prussian King. They knew that Germany had lacked contact with the world for fourteen years, was internally divided, and had broken down, falling into a deplorable situation. But now, it was different from the past. The new government was not based on the benevolence of political parties, nor on economic power, but on people publicly elected, endowing it with the supreme powers recorded in German history. A new society was formed by all industries at home and all sectors of the past. Its work should be limited to one year, or to a period of ten years, but it has not lessened the emotional impact on the hearts of most German laborers, as can be seen from the effect achieved on the German Labor Day in 1932. However, for the sake of superficial practical results, the work was not done by laborers alone, but by those who exerted both mental and physical effort to jointly perform their duties and serve society. In the past, Hitler's socialist program was observed by the majority of unbelievers. Some truly hoped for it, while others feared that this doctrine was a bureaucratic signboard, fooling the general body of laborers. Hitler, as the people's Chancellor, clarified that the center of his nation's existence was socialism, just as it was the center of nationalism. Therefore, workers called him a great man of mankind. In a small state within Germany, opposition in its villages and towns was extraordinary, denouncing liberalism. Farmers were one of the beneficial classes. Therefore, farmers and townspeople endlessly fought over taxation. The National Socialist Party had already understood the increased privileges of farmers and had established permanent innovations. At the Thanksgiving festival, Hitler in Berlin gave a speech on his most profound ideas. Hitler said that National Socialism was not based on individuals, nor on human feelings. The center of its driving force was the state, and the state was a society composed of essence and blood. Individuals perish, but the state extends infinitely. The most noble and most honest representatives of the people should be elected from this kind of population, capable of exhausting their energy from the fertile fields. The world has proven the victory of the National Socialist Party and the suspected recovery of the German army. They did not understand Hitler's true nature and expected revenge. If at that time the condition of shared suffering were considered an honor, and were rooted in mutual respect and equality, Hitler would be guided by the hope of shared suffering. The issue of disarmament led to disputes among countries around the world, because Germans did not have this problem. The most ordinary person could have this answer. On November 12th, this question was already asked: Did the people consider disarmament to be the leader's policy? Ninety percent of the voters answered "yes." The German people had no intention of preparing weapons and fighting with other countries. The army had no ambition either, because the vanity of the World War era had no room left. Germany sincerely wished to achieve understanding and reconciliation. But as the leader said, they would rather face hardship and oppression than sign a treaty in the future by which people who take vanity as honor should be subjugated. For the sake of European peace, Hitler was unanimously approved by the people, a rumor spread overseas that the German people, under the control of a small number of autocrats, did not dare to raise their voices loudly, passing quickly. The secret ballot of the people led to the formation of the new parliament. This proved that opposing this parliament was not serving various groups, nor was it a contest of disputes. Hitler wished to organize a society of people loyal to the leader, which could help him complete the great work he had identified, namely the reform of the German nation. (End)</p>

<p>Military Key Point of the Aleutian Islands</p>
<p>Weeks of Airplane and Submarine Measurement</p>
<p>Juneau - Two squadrons of naval reconnaissance planes, a total of twelve, departed from San Diego in formation, completed 7,700 miles of coastal flight, and arrived here safely today. They plan to stay in Alaska for several days before flying to various cities in the American Arctic. They will also extend their stay to familiarize themselves with the coastal terrain and flight conditions in the Alaskan area, and prepare a detailed report to be submitted to the Naval Aviation Department. A submarine squadron and its mother ship set sail from here today for the Aleutian Islands. A large part of their work will be to deploy the US Navy in the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands for annual exercises in 1935. An army air force squadron, having completed its long-distance voyage from Washington, has also flown to Alaska. The Army and Navy are now devoting all their efforts to pay attention to the situation in Alaska, especially the Aleutian Islands, because in the event of war with Japan, the Aleutian Islands are a military key point.

<p>Endorses Navy League Policy</p>
<p>(Washington) - Navy Secretary Swanson today endorsed the recommendation made yesterday by Navy League President Murphy. Swanson said, "I endorse the Navy League's policy because it not only focuses on an orderly shipbuilding plan, but also emphasizes its importance." Swanson also believes it is necessary to replenish the strength of the fleet's officers and men. According to the Navy Department, as of July 1, the 82,500 officers and men of the US fleet only accounted for 83 percent of the original number. Swanson's opinion will be made into a proposal by the Navy Department and submitted to the next Congress for a vote. (30th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Baldwin Delivers Bold Speech</p>
<p>Emphasizes the Necessity of the Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>(London) - The House of Commons today, by a vote of 404 to 60, rejected the Labour Party's impeachment motion against the government's air force expansion. The complete failure of the impeachment motion proves that Parliament strongly supports the Cabinet's plan to double the strength of the British Air Force. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) - The House of Commons today resumed discussion of the British government's plan to increase the strength of the air force by 41 squadrons over the next five years. Acting Prime Minister Baldwin replied that Britain had increased its air force by a very small amount in the past four years, only 42 aircraft, while France increased its aircraft by two or three hundred and passed £15 million for air force reorganization. Italy added 65 aircraft, now totaling 1,000 or 1,200 aircraft, and allocated £2.75 million for reorganization expenses. Belgium is also increasing the number of aircraft in its first line of defense by 30 percent. The United States has added 240 aircraft in the past four years and has decided to continue adding 1,184 aircraft. The Russian Air Force has also greatly increased. As for Germany's position, it is difficult to estimate, but if Germany is free to re-establish its military equipment, the first thing it will consider will be the air force, because Germany often says that Germany has no air defense and cannot obtain security. Baldwin concluded by saying that he did not want to say much about the situation behind the scenes, but that the current situation contained seriousness, which no one could ignore unless they were foolish. Collective guarantees could be the ultimate guarantee of Europe, but if armaments have some value in collective guarantees, then weapons must have appropriate equipment. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) - The House of Commons passed today the air force expansion program proposed by the Cabinet. When the case was submitted for discussion, the Labour Party opposition had submitted a motion to condemn the government, which was answered by Acting Prime Minister Baldwin, who said that if one examines various international events and disarmament issues, the difficulty is greater than in the past twelve months. During this period, Germany withdrew from Geneva, and in recent times, Germany seems unlikely to return to Geneva. As for the events that have occurred throughout Europe, especially the recent events in Austria, it further proves that there are signs of anxiety and turmoil everywhere. The Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact seems to have little hope of success. He went on to describe the aviation defense of various countries, paying particular attention to Germany, saying that the Hitler regime attaches great importance to aviation issues. He also said that if international peace is based on common security, then Britain has already fulfilled its existing obligations. As for adding new obligations, Britain is unwilling to consider it. What we cannot forget is that since the invention of aviation, the national boundaries of the past have disappeared. If we think of Britain's national defense, it is no longer on the cliffs of the Dover coast, but on the Rhine, because the Rhine has now become our country's border. He then described the outline of the five-year air force expansion plan. Britain currently has 844 aircraft, which will increase to 1,304 in five years, and plans to take new measures to protect civilians in wartime. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) - When the House of Commons discussed the government's air force expansion program yesterday, Acting Prime Minister Baldwin said that the British sky boundary was no longer on the cliffs of the Strait of Dover, but on the Rhine. Various newspapers commented on Baldwin's statement, considering it the most serious and bold statement of British foreign policy since 1918. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) - After the British government's five-year plan to add 41 air force squadrons was debated in the House of Commons today, the Labour Party's impeachment motion, opposing the government's policy of re-establishing military equipment, was rejected by a vote of 404 to 60. Foreign Secretary Simon concluded the debate on the case, saying that the government's proposal was not affected by conversations with other countries. The government's decision was first announced in the House of Commons. This was the result of a long-term study of all aspects of the air force issue. The current strength of the British Air Force is 890 aircraft in the first line of defense. The government's expansion plan will increase the air force by 41 squadrons within five years, of which 33 squadrons will be included in the national defense air force. Therefore, the number of domestic air force squadrons will increase from the current 42 squadrons to 75 squadrons. The remaining 8 squadrons will be attached to the fleet or transferred abroad. This program has been finally approved by the Cabinet and will make the strength of the British Air Force equal to that of its neighbors. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Scope of Discussion Limited to Technical Issues</p>
<p>Italian Battleship Construction Plan Not Involved</p>
<p>(London) - This morning, Italian naval expert Piccia and British naval experts from both the Foreign and Admiralty Offices continued their talks, which have now concluded. The scope of the talks was limited to naval technical issues, namely the issues that should be discussed at next year's naval conference after the expiration of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, such as (1) the gun positions of various warships, (2) a list of warships that have reached the age for replacement, (3) naval armaments limitation issues, including (a) total tonnage limitation, (b) classification tonnage limitation, and (c) gun position limitation. Mr. Piccia's trip is only consultative in nature, with the emphasis on preparing everything for this autumn's naval preparatory conference. The issue of Italy's recent decision to build two 35,000-ton battleships was not mentioned, because these warships are permitted under the Washington Naval Treaty. At present, what can be discussed is only whether the construction is appropriate for the times. However, this level is political in nature and cannot be interfered with by naval telegrams, so there is no possibility of discussion at this time. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Opposes Current Ratio Principle</p>
<p>Conducts Conciliatory Diplomacy with the United States</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - At 2:30 this afternoon, Prime Minister Okada hosted 20 foreign news and communication reporters at his official residence for the first time, reading the following statement: The current government's foreign policy has been clearly stated in the imperial rescript and policy outline of March 27 last year. Its fundamental policy is to seek world peace. Now that various countries are experiencing fluctuations in politics, economy, and ideology, and international relations are also experiencing unrest, we must use various means to restore international relations and maintain peace. Although "Manchukuo" has only been established for two years, its sound development is truly commendable. The Empire has always provided full assistance and intends to continue to provide assistance in the future. The turmoil in China has a significant impact on the political situation in East Asia, so the Empire is most concerned about it. The relationship with Soviet Russia should be carefully considered. At present, there are no pending issues with the United States, and a traditional friendly relationship is maintained with Britain. However, commercial disputes have arisen everywhere recently, but they can be adjusted with a spirit of mutual concession. We are a nation that is progressing day by day, so we strive to maintain, enhance, and improve friendly relations with other countries. If other countries fully recognize the Empire's position in East Asia and understand its ability to pacify East Asia and promote peace, then the various issues in East Asia and the naval issue will not be difficult to resolve, and we believe that we can contribute to the promotion of world peace. (31st Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - After Prime Minister Okada met with foreign reporters today and read the statement, he answered questions from the foreign reporters. First, Repp, the representative of the United Press, questioned the opinion on the naval issue. Prime Minister Okada replied that the armaments of various countries should be limited to the minimum extent. True disarmament should be carried out by countries with the strongest military equipment limiting their military equipment. The reporter asked if Japan's claim to abandon the ratio means shrinking the British and American navies to the level of Japan. The Prime Minister replied that this was not the intention. In principle, we cannot agree with the current ratio, but we do not expect rapid changes. The reporter asked if there was an intention to abandon the Washington Treaty. The Prime Minister replied that whether to abandon it or not is currently under study. The reporter asked if they were dissatisfied with the ratio, then what methods were there for disarmament. The Prime Minister replied that other appropriate methods could be found, but now was not the time to speak clearly. The reporter asked if Japan hopes for success at the next disarmament conference. The Prime Minister replied that he personally hopes for success. Even if it breaks down, Japan and the United States will not compete to build warships afterwards. The reporter asked if President Roosevelt's visit to Hawaii was related to strengthening the naval base. The Prime Minister replied that if no actual problems occur, then it is impossible to know. The reporter asked whether maintaining the South Seas Mandate Territory was more important for military or commercial reasons. The Prime Minister replied that from the perspective of investment and other relations, commerce should be more important. The reporter asked about the Prime Minister's views on Japan-US relations. The Prime Minister replied that Japan and the United States must always maintain friendly relations. (31st Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>Bloody Shirt Serves as Evidence, Viewers Moved to Compassion</p>
<p>Vienna: Today, the trial of the murderers of Dr. Dollfuss continued. The undershirt worn by Dr. Dollfuss on the day of his assassination was presented as evidence in court. Part of the shirt was stained with blood, and the stiff collar was blackened by gunpowder residue. The sight moved everyone. Experts testified that the muzzle of the gun was at least eight inches away from Dr. Dollfuss when fired. After being shot, his arms and legs were paralyzed. Even with medical assistance, his life could not be extended beyond two hours. Furthermore, police inspector Stanberger claimed that he had requested both a doctor and a priest for Dr. Dollfuss, but the family doctor could not be reached immediately, and the telephone line was cut, so a priest could not be invited either. Stanberger stated that he was not in the room when Dr. Dollfuss was shot and suddenly felt weak, so he was carried out of the courtroom. After all the witnesses testified, the judges determined that defendants Panneta and Hollswebach were indeed guilty of murdering Dr. Dollfuss and sentenced them to death by hanging. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Vienna: After hearing the verdict, Panneta said that he had fulfilled his duty to the country. Hollswebach told the court that he had participated in the rebellion because he heard that a new government had been established without bloodshed and was willing to accept the consequences of his actions. The defendants' lawyers pleaded for exemption from punishment in the name of National Socialism, claiming that the new Austrian constitution was illegal. They are now petitioning President Miklas for clemency. Continued report: The petition for clemency has been rejected by the president, and the two criminals have been executed by firing squad. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Vienna: National Socialist Party members Panneta and Hollswebach, accused of shooting and killing Prime Minister Dollfuss, were tried by a special military tribunal this afternoon. The courthouse was heavily guarded, and no unauthorized persons were allowed inside. When the defendants arrived, they were escorted by military police. Both were wearing ordinary clothes, and their shoelaces had been removed to prevent suicide. Both were accused of firing one shot each at Dr. Dollfuss. According to the prosecutor's opening statement, neither of the bullets fired by the two defendants were fatal. Dr. Dollfuss died from excessive blood loss due to a lack of medical attention after being wounded.</p>
<p>Defendant Panneta testified that before their rebellion, someone had told them that certain high-ranking officials would provide protection and instructed them not to shed blood unless absolutely necessary for self-defense. He had entered a dark room in the Prime Minister's office and ordered a robust man, likely Major Fey, to raise his hands. He suddenly felt someone touch his right arm and noticed that there was another person in the room, who was Dr. Dollfuss. He personally saw Dr. Dollfuss fall to the ground and heard him say, "I yield my position to Rintelen."</p>
<p>When asked why he entered the Prime Minister's office, Panneta replied that he wanted to detain all the cabinet members and inquire about the reason for this. Panneta did not answer. Panneta continued to testify that after they were captured in the Prime Minister's office, Vienna Deputy Police Chief Stuher gave a speech to the crowd, saying that if the murderers of Dr. Dollfuss confessed, the rest would be freed. Panneta was very indignant because he had confessed, but none of his comrades were freed. Stuher then testified that he had promised freedom to the rebels who were not involved in the murder of Prime Minister Dollfuss and former army and police personnel.</p>
<p>Hollswebach, accused of treason, mentioned in his testimony an unknown, strange person who ordered him to arrest the cabinet members, saying that this person issued the order in the name of the Federal President. "I complied," he said.</p>
<p>When Major Fey testified in court, security was increased. Fey admitted that he had told Hollswebach that if the rebels released the hostages, they would be granted freedom, given safe passage, sent to the German border, and promised that his words would be kept.</p>
<p>Minister of Social Welfare Stuermer also testified, admitting that he knew that after Dr. Dollfuss's death, he had still agreed to grant safe passage to the rebels. However, he later heard that Prime Minister Dollfuss had been murdered, not fatally wounded in mutual combat, so he felt that the situation was different from before. "I am a soldier and respect my word. However, whether the murder of Prime Minister Dollfuss was the act of a soldier or a coward, and whether this murder was a despicable conspiracy, I am willing to let the court decide," he said.</p>
<p>At this point, the defendants' lawyer pleaded exhaustion and requested an adjournment. The court rejected the request, and the defendants' lawyer announced his withdrawal from the court, forcing the court to continue the trial tomorrow. The court said it would punish the lawyer and rejected the lawyer's request to subpoena former German ambassador to Austria, Dr. Rieth, and the new Prime Minister, Schuschnigg, to testify. The defendants' lawyer also requested that the indictment for assassination be revised, but this was also rejected.</p>
<p>According to reports, Panneta's wife said she wanted to visit Mrs. Dollfuss and that she missed Mrs. Dollfuss and her children very much. Mrs. Dollfuss would certainly not blame her. The last time she saw her husband was on July 24th, when he was wearing a bathrobe and said he was going swimming. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The cabinet held a special meeting last night and issued an order that the property of all those who participated in the National Socialist rebellion would be confiscated. Those with minor involvement would be detained in concentration camps and sentenced to hard labor. The cabinet also listened to the report of the Minister of Defense, who said that national security had been restored and the rebels' last attempt had failed. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>While Starhemberg's Real Power Expands</p>
<p>Lack of Qualifications Prevents Immediate Appointment as Prime Minister</p>
<p>Vienna: Military police are still on strict alert throughout Austria today, but the situation seems very calm. The international tension has also eased somewhat since the formal announcement last night that Foreign Minister Tauschnitz has been transferred to the post of ambassador to Germany. Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg has also resumed his position as commander of the "Patriotic Front" today. This unit was originally part of Dollfuss's old guard and has exclusive rights to the term "Patriotic." Key government positions are also monopolized by members of this unit. (National Telegraph, 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris): The formation of the Schuschnigg cabinet in Austria was swift and has been met with satisfaction by various newspapers here. They believe that Schuschnigg will be able to complete Dollfuss's unfinished business. While the new cabinet may face dangers, it will certainly lead to an obvious improvement in the international political situation. L'Écho de Paris reported, "Schuschnigg's personality and his relationship with the late Prime Minister Dollfuss are clear evidence that the new cabinet will follow in his footsteps." Le Petit Parisien reported, "The new government's resolute determination not to allow Germany to use underhanded tricks to interfere in Austrian internal affairs is enough to make the countries responsible for guaranteeing Austria's independence feel sympathetic and willing to help." (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London): London correspondents in Vienna report that Austria is once again in the midst of a rapidly brewing coup. Since Minister of Education Schuschnigg was appointed Federal Chancellor, the Heimwehr has unanimously clamored for Prince Starhemberg to succeed Dollfuss as Federal Chancellor and for the two advisors to the Federal Chancellor to also be members of the Heimwehr. According to reports from Vienna, a state of emergency was declared twice yesterday. Government offices were heavily guarded by military police, as if facing a major enemy, and the Heimwehr headquarters were surrounded by three lines of defense. London's public opinion is very satisfied with Schuschnigg's appointment as Federal Chancellor, as it believes that Prince Starhemberg's political qualifications have not yet been established and that he lacks diplomatic experience. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris): A correspondent for the Paris Morning Post in Vienna reported today that while the momentary crisis in the Austrian capital has passed, divisions of opinion at the highest levels still exist. All current activities and mutual attacks are fueled by deep-rooted nationalism and political fanaticism. The two main goals are (1) the old theory of complete annexation with Germany and (2) the continued maintenance of Austria's independence. Victory News today also revealed the following about the Austrian situation: "The Italian government's opposition to the major powers' joint intervention methods in Berlin has become increasingly firm. However, Mussolini's opposition to joint intervention by the powers does not indicate goodwill towards Germany, but rather because he deeply believes that intervention is useless. He has decided to act, not just talk." The attitude of the authorities in Paris remains as firm and suspicious as it has been in recent days. France's policy is to cooperate with both London and Rome to avoid the suspicion of hasty intervention. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Problem of Employment After Graduation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The problem after university graduation is the problem of employment. Students study hard for several years, and once they reach graduation, who isn't happy and excited, expressing their satisfaction? But once they think of the pain of unemployment, who isn't worried and crying out loudly? According to the declaration issued by the Beiping University Students' Employment Movement Alliance and its letter to university graduates across the country, it is clear that the majority of university graduates are currently deeply troubled by unemployment and don't know what to do in the future. At this time of national crisis, we believe that it is a great loss to the country that these ambitious young people cannot contribute what they have learned to the nation. Therefore, for the sake of the country, appropriate relief should be provided as soon as possible so that each can develop their strengths, in accordance with the purpose of cultivating talent for the country. If the three points of President Wang's reply to the students' representatives' requests can be earnestly implemented, it would be a blessing for the unemployed students in general.</p>
<p>However, when we look back, since the abolition of the imperial examination system and the establishment of schools, the educators have never stopped thinking about the students' career prospects after graduation. However, the way of arranging employment has only been considered from the perspective of government offices, and society has often been alienated from and not very appreciative of these educated talents. Therefore, until today, scholars only know how to become officials and seek a living in the bureaucracy. In fact, the number of government officials in the country is limited, and the number of those who want to become officials to make a living is infinite. As a result, the political path is crowded, learning is not applied, and application is not learned, which has become a common ailment. Moreover, the ups and downs of officialdom are uncertain, and personnel changes are impermanent. Between one gain and one loss, promising young people often turn into social germs in an instant. This not only loses the original meaning of education but also becomes a furnace for destroying talent. This is the error of seeking employment exclusively in officialdom.</p>
<p>Then, should they abandon officialdom and seek employment in various state-run enterprises? But how many state-run enterprises can there be? Should they retreat further and seek employment in agriculture, industry, and commerce? It seems that agriculture, industry, and commerce have more uses and a wider scope and should be able to recruit a large number of talents to gradually improve their businesses. However, although we claim to be a country founded on agriculture, the methods of agricultural production and the relationship between land and population distribution make it difficult to accommodate specialized talents. Moreover, talents with specialized agricultural knowledge find it even more difficult to return to the countryside and relive the peasant life that is similar to primitive society. Therefore, the fact that agriculture is not a viable outlet for university students has already been proven and can be dismissed. In addition, the fields of industry and commerce seem to be most needed in today's world of industrial and commercial competition. However, China is not only affected by the economic panic but also subjected to various external pressures. Even relatively upwardly developing industries such as the textile industry cannot even maintain the status quo, let alone have room to accommodate new talents. Various other businesses are declining day by day and are difficult to develop for a while. Moreover, industry and commerce have their own personnel origins and a certain scope and value business experience, offer low compensation, and require a lot of work, which is incompatible with the ambitions of university students. As a result, the career path for university graduates is becoming narrower, and the unemployment problem is becoming more serious.</p>
<p>In the past, our country's education only focused on the cultivation of knowledge during the school period. However, whether this kind of cultivation is sufficient and whether it is practical, the school authorities have not deeply researched, and the educated themselves have no ability to choose. Therefore, whether knowledge can be applied to practice remains to be known only after future experimentation. During the school years, students are almost isolated from society. Once they leave school and enter society, they have a feeling of not knowing where to go. The education authorities cannot but bear their responsibility. Therefore, we advocate today that, on the one hand, the education authorities should be urged to work hard to eliminate long-standing malpractices and open up career paths for graduating youth, and on the other hand, the graduating students should also be cautious in their choice of careers. First, they must understand the current situation and whether they have appropriate knowledge and ability to promote a certain career, and whether they have a deep understanding of it. Second, most young people in school are ambitious but lack talent and often fail to deeply understand the facts. Once life presses in and the social economy is shaken, few can avoid being seriously hit. Therefore, after leaving school and encountering unemployment difficulties, they must have a spirit of enduring hardship, being able to suffer losses, being able to persevere, and not being tempted by external factors. With such efforts and struggles, there will be results in the future. Third, they must pay attention to small things. Promising young people in our country often become discouraged and depressed at the slightest setback. Once they achieve success, they forget their original mission. They should try to encourage themselves, start from small things, work hard, and not pursue distant goals. Individuals can get opportunities for training, and the country and nation can also benefit accordingly. Therefore, although they are in dire straits today, there is still great hope for the future.</p>

<p>Long-Suffering from Cystitis Leads to Weakness</p>
<p>Approaching Ancient Times, Fear He Will Not Recover</p>
<p>Much Speculation About His Successor as President</p>
<p>Neudeck: President Hindenburg has been suffering from cystitis for a long time. His condition worsened on Sunday night, and he is gradually failing. Doctors today expressed extreme concern about the president's life. This highly respected heroic statesman, whose life has exceeded that of the German Empire, was still able to receive guests and read official documents as usual until Monday. But since then, due to old age and prolonged illness, he has gradually become unsustainable and is feared he will not recover. The official statement said that President Hindenburg has been suffering from cystitis for many months, but since going to Neudeck for treatment, his condition has greatly improved. He was in slightly better spirits this morning. Although unwilling to be confined to his bed, he insisted on getting up for a short sit. According to the attending physician's bulletin at 12:25 this afternoon, "The President got up this morning and took tonics. He was quite interested in the surrounding environment. He went back to bed and fell asleep without chills or fever. His pulse was strong and slightly rapid." The German constitution stipulates that in the event of the President's death, the Chief Justice of the German Supreme Court will temporarily act as president. However, it is believed here that a cabinet meeting will be convened to temporarily hand over the presidential duties to Prime Minister Hitler, and General Goering, a confidant of Prime Minister Hitler, may serve as Deputy Prime Minister. President Hindenburg experienced the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and witnessed the rise and fall of the German Empire. He was old and originally hoped to retire to Hanover to end his days. Unexpectedly, the European War broke out in 1914, and the German army had to fight France in the west and Russia in the east. Hindenburg was called out of retirement to lead the army in a fierce battle, defeating the Russian army and saving the German Empire. He then witnessed the defeat of the German army, the exile of Emperor Wilhelm, and the establishment of the republic, and then retired again. Unexpectedly, he was elected as President, and had to come out of retirement again to save the German Republic. (National Telegraph, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin): According to today's bulletin, the German President Hindenburg's unwellness is worrying. It is reported that he is suffering from weakness. Until the end of last week, the German President was still healthy, and he was still well yesterday, but he felt unwell at night and was quite weak. The German President is now eighty-seven years old, and he is old, so the doctors are quite anxious. However, they hope that his physical strength is good and that he will recover soon. At 12:25 this afternoon, four doctors signed and issued a bulletin, saying that President Hindenburg got up, ate a little breakfast, and paid attention to the people around him. Then he went to bed, and soon fell asleep again, without chills or fever, and his pulse was normal and stronger than before. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Another telegram: The German official news agency issued a notice this afternoon, saying that President Hindenburg's condition is now causing great anxiety. It is generally believed that if President Hindenburg passes away, the Duke of Brunswick, the son-in-law of the German former emperor, is the most promising successor. The Duke had planned to go to Japan to participate in the International Red Cross Conference, but due to the President's precarious condition, he has now abandoned the plan. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin): The news of President Hindenburg's critical illness has shocked the German people. There is much speculation about who will succeed Hindenburg as President. In addition to the Duke of Brunswick, the following are possible candidates: (1) General Mackensen, 85 years old, a famous general in the European War, (2) President Hindenburg's son, a large landowner and his father's advisor, (3) Chief of Staff of the Defense Forces, General Fritsch, (4) Prime Minister Hitler. According to the old constitution, the president must be elected by the German people. However, after Hitler took office as Prime Minister, the election law was amended, approved by President Hindenburg, and authorized the cabinet to act expediently. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin): President Hindenburg's ill health is a cause for great concern. Prime Minister Hitler has convened an emergency meeting of all cabinet members. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin): This afternoon, a high-ranking official told a Reuters reporter that President Hindenburg's condition must be considered serious and that precautions must be taken in case of the worst. According to reports, the German President joined the army in 1865 and participated in many battles. When the European War broke out, he was living in retirement in the wilderness, but he was soon appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Prussian Army. In 1916, he was appointed as the Chief of Staff until the end of the European War. After the death of German President Ebert in 1925, he was elected as President. On April 10, 1932, he was re-elected as the German head of state with a majority of six million votes. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Following the summer floods in various counties of the two provinces of Northern Manchuria, Jilin and Heilongjiang, a plague has broken out.

<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama stated, "There are no fundamental problems regarding my return to Tibet. Since I have been in the Central Plains for a long time, the preparations are quite complex. I plan to go to Yimeng to chant scriptures after the PingSui Railway reopens, and then go to Qinghai to return to Tibet via a detour. I expect to travel around autumn and winter this year. If time is not sufficient, I may spend the winter at sea and set off next spring, which is also possible. The four northeastern provinces are adjacent to Ximeng. Because the four northeastern provinces have been occupied, Dongmeng has become a vassal of these four provinces. This is not the wish of the officials and people of Dongmeng. Reports claiming that unscrupulous Wang Gong are plotting collusion with Ximeng at the instigation of the Japanese, or even uniting with Outer Mongolia to pledge allegiance to Japan, are merely fantasies. I can say with certainty that this will not become a reality. The Japanese often claim that Inner Mongolia is attempting to brew an autonomous group, or that the Soviet Union has some kind of conspiracy regarding the entire Mongolian territory. However, the Chinese nation is a great nation united by the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan ethnic groups, and cannot act alone. Otherwise, 'if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold,' as the ancient saying goes. When I was stationed in Dongmeng and Ximeng in the past, my impression was that the Mongolians clearly knew that they were Chinese citizens, and they knew nothing else. Recently, after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Political Affairs Council, its purpose is to improve the lives of the Mongolians and build the area, with no other purposes. The various points reported by the Japanese are absolutely not true. The Tibetan people's inclination towards the interior has never waned. Since the news of my return to Tibet spread there, officials and people have cheered enthusiastically. Envoys welcoming me are constantly on the road. Representatives of the three major monasteries in the former Tibet are already on their way and will arrive soon. Qinghai and Tibet border the United Kingdom, so the relationship is difficult to sever immediately. I have known many important British figures for a long time. I believe that national rejuvenation and diplomatic relations must be clearly distinguished and cannot be confused. The Dalai Lama also based his claims on this, seeking the welfare of the country. Rumors that the Dalai Lama is training soldiers himself and serving as the commander-in-chief of the Tibetan army are inaccurate, because religion and politics cannot be mixed."

<p>Kong Xiangxi's Reply to Wu Zhihui</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi's reply to Wu Zhihui stated, "When the Shenxin Textile Mill incident occurred, I was on my way. I tried to maintain it several times, and after returning, I conducted various investigations and consulted with President Wang of the Executive Yuan, the Economic Commission of the Ministry of Industry, and colleagues in Shanghai to carefully study and find ways to help. I also showed your opinions to Chairman Chiang, and I am even more grateful for your concern for national products and the maintenance of industry. After reading Mr. Zhou Danzhi's letter, I admire him deeply. The difficulty of returning to state-owned enterprises is evident in practice, as you said. Regarding the issue of government loans to maintain the mill, I have promised Mr. Rong to discuss it. When I first returned to Shanghai, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, and others visited me. I immediately expressed that the government believes that the scale of the Shenxin Textile Mill is grand, its creation was difficult, and Mr. Rong's fighting spirit is rare in the industrial world of our country today. Moreover, its business is related to people's livelihood and is not just a matter of personal success or failure. At this critical moment, we should do our best to maintain it so that it can overcome difficulties. Since then, anyone who has questioned me about this matter has been told the same. Now that all parties know the government's intentions, they are no longer demanding from Mr. Rong, and Mr. Rong can also operate more flexibly and find his own path. As for the financial aspects in the future, if government assistance is necessary, we will do our best to find a way to live up to your expectations and will never allow it to stop, so as to curb the opportunity for the industry to grow. This is my intention for this case, and I believe it is the government's duty. However, our country is currently in a period of backward production and economic oppression. To compete with foreigners in the market, it seems that we must gradually improve in terms of technology and management, so that after spending less and achieving greater results, it will become more stable. I believe that you and Mr. Rong share the same feeling, and I deeply admire your insights and hopes. I would like to forward this intention, or it may be a key to the revival of Shenxin. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi said that the Shenxin Textile Mill had excessive debts in the past, making it difficult to continue. The government believed that it was related to the entire industry and had a significant impact on the market, so it was discussed at the Central Political Conference that the government should step in to maintain it. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance investigated the matter and are currently planning it. Recently, Rong himself has gradually found a solution, so the government's efforts to maintain Rong's business are to spiritually ensure that creditors do not urge repayments, and materially allow Rong's factories to pay unified taxes on credit, so as to facilitate turnover. Because Rong's factories pay about 800,000 yuan in unified taxes each month, the government will provide relief. At most, it will need to allocate 3 to 4 million yuan, so this tax credit method will sufficiently relieve Rong's business of considerable difficulties. As for the reorganization plan, it will be temporarily shelved. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

After Hu Zongnan's troops were stationed in Gansu, the Central Government approved the establishment of a Northwest Replenishment Brigade, with Liao Ang as the brigade commander, for training in Lanzhou. The Gansu Provincial Government, in view of the huge military expenses that need to be paid, has decided to levy the Xia Mang money and grain starting from August 1, with a deadline of 15 days to be remitted to the province.

<p>The New Life Movement and the Four Cardinal Principles: Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame</p>
<p>Various parties have three questions related to the New Life Movement. First, China has many inherent virtues. Why does the New Life Movement specifically advocate "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame"? Isn't this focusing on one thing while neglecting others?</p>
<p>A General Review of Human Morality</p>
<p>(1) Morality Transcending Time and Space</p>
<p>(2) Morality Tied to Time and Space</p>
<p>(1) Private Morality... Morality of Society Under Familism</p>
<p>(2) Public Morality</p>
<p>A. Morality of Society Under the Ideal of Great Harmony</p>
<p>B. Morality of Society Under the Ideal of Universalism</p>
<p>C. Morality of Society Under Nationalism</p>
<p>Second, although "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" are a type of inherent Chinese social morality, they are actually plain and unremarkable, and an old remedy that has long been ineffective. They are not a special medicine imported from abroad. China's condition is very complicated. Can this old remedy be used as a panacea for saving the country?</p>
<p>(1) "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" are indeed a famous old remedy in China. However, in the past, has China ever taken the medicine according to the prescription? If the medicine was taken, it was not based on this prescription, or it was occasionally adopted while arbitrarily adding or subtracting ingredients, considering it an aid to other main prescriptions. Then, it cannot be concluded that this old remedy is ineffective. (2) "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" are indeed an inherent Chinese old remedy, not a special medicine invented by foreign countries. However, in various Western and Eastern countries under modern nationalism, the common medicine they use to maintain society, when analyzed, contains many components of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." If foreign countries have this medicine without this prescription, then this ancient Chinese prescription is even more worthy of attention.</p>
<p>(3) Whether "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" can be used as a panacea for saving the country should be determined by whether the medicine is suitable for the illness. Although China's current condition is very complicated, tracing the source of the disease, it is indeed mostly caused by a lack of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." Therefore, our main prescription should only emphasize the four ingredients of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." Long-term adherence is necessary, and arbitrary addition or subtraction is not allowed, especially mixing Chinese and Western medicines.</p>
<p>Third, why must "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" be expressed in daily life, in food, clothing, housing, and transportation? This requires the virtues of inner cultivation. If we only focus on the external expression of form, wouldn't it be close to superficiality and easily lead to hypocrisy?</p>
<p>In my previous speech, I used "Revolution First Revolutionizes the Heart, Political Reform First Changes Customs" as the title. In thousands of words, everything I said was a wedge for the New Life Movement, a general explanation of why we should do the New Life Movement. Regarding the content and importance of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speeches, in addition to being printed into booklets, also personally wrote the Outline of the New Life Movement and Essentials for the New Life, providing a systematic explanation that is both detailed and comprehensive. There is no need for me to add unnecessary details. After this movement occurred, it spread like wildfire, and the whole country responded. It can be seen that it is clearly appropriate for the people's hearts and deeply aligns with the consistent demands of the people. There is also no need to make further inferences. However, summarizing the comments from various parties, there are still several related questions that inevitably arise. Although the views cannot be completely identical, they are all well-intentioned discussions and not fundamental disapprovals. Now, taking this opportunity, I will answer the following three questions separately, making a "comment on the comments": First, China has many inherent virtues. Why does the New Life Movement specifically advocate "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame"? Isn't this focusing on one thing while neglecting others?</p>
<p>Second, although "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" are a type of inherent Chinese social morality, they are actually plain and unremarkable, and an old remedy that has long been ineffective. They are not a special medicine imported from abroad. China's condition is very complicated. Can this old remedy be used as a panacea for saving the country? Third, why must "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" be expressed in daily life, in "food, clothing, housing, and transportation"? This requires the virtues of inner cultivation. If we only focus on the external expression of form, wouldn't it be close to superficiality and easily lead to hypocrisy?</p>
<p>The above three questions have been successively raised by various parties since the New Life Movement occurred. The following answers them one by one in order.</p>
<p>First, China has many inherent virtues. Why does the New Life Movement specifically advocate "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame"? Isn't this focusing on one thing while neglecting others?</p>
<p>China indeed has many inherent virtues. Confucius and Mencius spoke of "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage," calling them the three universally recognized virtues, setting them as the highest goals to strive for. They also spoke of the five relationships and the five constants. The five relationships are "affection between father and son, righteousness between ruler and subject, distinction between husband and wife, order between elder and younger, and trust between friends." The five constants are "benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness." There was no specific discussion of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." In the time of Confucius and Mencius, the four characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" had not yet been combined into a single term. The "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" spoken of after the Han and Song dynasties were also mentioned alongside the eight characters "Filial piety, Brotherly love, Loyalty, and Trustworthiness." "Filial piety, Brotherly love, Loyalty, and Trustworthiness" were still ranked ahead of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame," and their special importance was not highlighted. Even Sun Yat-sen, in his Nationalism, said that we must restore the inherent morality of the Chinese nation. First is loyalty and filial piety, second is benevolence and love, third is trustworthiness and righteousness, and fourth is peace. (Some say that these are the eight virtues, which is actually incorrect. We can only say that loyalty and filial piety are one virtue, benevolence and love are one virtue, trustworthiness and righteousness are one virtue, and peace is one virtue, which together are four virtues.) There was also no specific discussion of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." It can be seen that the Chinese morality advocated by past sages has various forms, all of which should be given equal importance. Why does Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically advocate "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" in the New Life Movement? Isn't this focusing on one thing while neglecting others? To understand this principle, we must first classify all human morality and conduct a review based on its nature. For the sake of convenient explanation, I want to classify it into a simple table to make it easy to understand at a glance. Roughly, all human morality can be broadly divided into two categories: one that transcends time and space and one that is tied to time and space. Morality that is tied to time and space can be further divided into two types: private morality and public morality. Private morality is the morality most revered by society under familism. Public morality can be further divided into three types: (1) the morality most revered by society under nationalism, (2) the morality most revered by society under universalism, and (3) the morality most revered by society under the ideal of great harmony. Understanding these types of morality and distinguishing the nature of these moralities, then the position of "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" among all kinds of morality and its importance in Chinese society today will become self-evident without detailed explanation.</p>
<p>(1) Morality That Transcends Time and Space</p>
<p>In my view, the "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" spoken of by our ancient sages and virtuous men are the highest morality of humankind that transcends time and region. Every nation, every country, or every religion should take this as the ultimate standard, practicing it for centuries without confusion and applying it to all corners of the world without error. The "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" of Confucianism are like the "Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom" of Buddhism. "Wisdom" is intelligence, and the meaning of "Concentration" is similar to "Benevolence." Buddhism emphasizes cultivation to achieve concentration. After concentration, there is nothing in the heart, not a single thought arises, like a bright mirror hanging high, capable of illuminating all phenomena, which is the result of seeing one's own nature. The word "Benevolence" in Confucianism, from the perspective of the function of "Benevolence," certainly has many aspects, but from the perspective of the essence of "Benevolence," it is the same principle as the "Concentration" of Buddhism. Yan Hui, Confucius's first major disciple, although very young, was the earliest to hear the Tao. His greatest strength was that "his heart did not deviate from Benevolence for three months." This is the effort of "Concentration," which he did very thoroughly. That is, the Great Learning says, "Knowing where to rest, you can have concentration; with concentration, you can be tranquil; with tranquility, you can be at peace; with peace, you can deliberate; with deliberation, you can achieve." This kind of effort of concentration means that the heart does not move recklessly, human desires are completely cleansed, and the principles of Heaven are fully preserved. Only Yan Hui could achieve this step, so he could become Confucius's most outstanding disciple. "Precepts" are similar to "Courage." Precepts are adhering to precepts. People must have things they will not do before they can have things they can do. At any time when one resolutely does not do something or resolutely does something, one must first make a determination. To make a determination, one must have a kind of courage. "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" and "Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom," although different on the surface, are actually no different in the effort of cultivation in essence. They are both the highest and most supreme morality that transcends time and space. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Russian Planes Reconnoiter Fujin, Hulin, Raohe and Other Counties</p>
<p>Russian Artillery Fires at Puppet Military District from Sanjiangkou Fortress</p>
<p>Japanese Use Confiscated Civilian Guns to Prepare for Conscription</p>
<p>According to people from Harbin, war clouds are gathering over Northeast China, with a sense of imminent outbreak. Therefore, the news of the Russo-Japanese war is spreading in various places in the Northeast, causing people to panic. The situation is especially serious in Harbin. Regarding the military preparations of both sides, on July 15, two Soviet Russian planes suddenly flew over the skies of Fujin, Hulin, Raohe, and other counties to scout the deployment of Japanese and puppet troops and military industrial facilities. The Soviet Russians have repeatedly fired artillery across the river at the puppet military district from the Sanjiangkou Fortress to show their threat. The Soviet Russians have also built fortifications along the border. Every night, searchlights begin to emit beams of light that are dazzling, like fire dragons, visible from across the river. On the Japanese and puppet side, Harbin has been under undeclared martial law recently, and travelers are being heavily inspected. There are also rumors that the Russo-Japanese War is about to begin, and the market is particularly sluggish. In order to prevent unforeseen circumstances, the Japanese and puppet authorities have been strictly interrogating travelers, pedestrians on the streets, and in hotels. It is reported that more than 50 young national salvation activists have been arrested and brutally killed. In order to expand military construction, the Japanese army has established eight major bureaus to handle civil engineering matters, such as repairing airfields, building military roads, and constructing border fortifications. These are all handled exclusively by the eight major bureaus and completely controlled by the Japanese. The Japanese military authorities are also forcing the puppet Ministry of Military Affairs to actively conscript soldiers, who are completely trained by the Japanese. All officers are filled by the Japanese. The civilian guns confiscated from various places this spring will be issued to the newly conscripted soldiers. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>Changes in the Collection of Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol license tax used to be collected by the Ministry of Finance. Since the financial conference decided to abolish excessive taxes in various provinces, cities, and counties to alleviate the people's suffering, the tobacco and alcohol license tax was transferred to the collection of each province and city as a compensation for the cancellation of excessive taxes. The licenses are still printed and issued by the Ministry of Finance to all provinces to be forwarded to the finance departments for compliance. Now, the county government received instructions from the finance department that the tobacco and alcohol license tax has been directly collected by this province since July 1st. Gu Baoyu has been appointed as the director and Pan Xiangxin as the deputy director to assist in the process. It is rumored that a Mr. Zhu from Pinghu has contracted the tax amount to be collected in this county, but he has not yet come to Songjiang.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department, in order to forcibly improve the silkworm industry in this province, strictly implemented silkworm seed control. In the spring cocoon season of this year, a improvement fee of three silver dollars was collected for each dan of dry cocoons. From the autumn cocoon season, twelve dollars must be paid to improve the silkworm and mulberry business. Now that the spring cocoon season has passed, the autumn cocoon season is approaching. Cocoon merchants in various places have protested against this method. For example, the Wujin and Yixing Cocoon Industry Associations, as well as various public groups such as the agricultural, commercial, and educational associations, all believe that the control method is close to excessive taxation, which harms farmers and is not conducive to business, and there is no hope of improving the business. They have successively telegraphed to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Campaign Headquarters, requesting orders to stop it. The Wuxi Silk Factory Association also stated that the silk industry is declining, the countryside is bankrupt, and there is a severe drought. Yesterday, they also telegraphed the provincial department to stop collecting this improvement fee for this autumn cocoon season.</p>

<p>Resolved to Restrict Rice Prices and Dredge Rice Sources</p>
<p>Ordered that Rice Inventory Be Surveyed Before Ordering Foreign Rice</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's Grain Committee held its 42nd regular meeting at the Cuixiutang in the City Temple at 1:00 PM yesterday. The meeting reported on the recent food situation in the city and discussed ways to suppress rice prices. The meeting adjourned at approximately 4:00 PM. The details of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Committee Members Present <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The committee members present were Chen Jixi, Yao Yuanjun, Zhou Minggang, Zhang Binghui, Lin Dun, Yu Zixiang, Wu Juenong, Huang Yinong (deputized by Cheng Fengyun), Lu Wenshao, Jiang Shizhi, Gu Xinyi, Wu Huanru, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Sun Yongyi, Huang Zune, and seventeen others.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Meeting Details <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, all the committee members arrived on time and the meeting began. Chairman Zhang Binghui and recorder Zhou Minggang performed the formalities. First, the chairman reported on the recent soaring rice prices. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions and began to discuss and decide on three relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Chairman's Report <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Zhang Binghui reported, briefly stating: (1) Since the 41st regular meeting of this committee, there have been no important proposals, so it has been regrettable that the meeting has not been held for a long time. Now that it is summer, the weather is arid and various places have reported disasters, which will inevitably affect the autumn harvest. Since January, rice prices in the city have soared by more than three yuan per stone. The future of the people's food is truly worrying. However, since the rice industry restricted rice prices and timely rains fell frequently, rice prices have gradually declined. However, it is feared that if the weather is dry again, the amount of rainfall will not be much, and the source will be reduced, and panic will occur again, which is difficult to say. The Social Bureau has repeatedly issued instructions from the municipal government to restrict the sharp rise in rice prices and to dredge rice sources to maintain the people's food. This committee is the only advisory body for the city's food problem. Please ask the committee members to express their opinions and seek solutions together. The city's food future truly depends on it. (2) The letter No. 6324 from the Social Bureau stated that according to the presentation of the City Rice Trade Association, rice is related to people's livelihoods, and they requested serious attention. They ordered that it be properly reviewed and reported. The original text has been issued to each committee member and is requested to be discussed together as a basis for reply. (The original text has been seen in the previous newspaper and is omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Committee Members' Statements <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, Committee Member Gu Xinyi rose to report, briefly stating: Since the rise in rice prices, the Rice Industry Association has considered ordering foreign rice to suppress rice prices, but because various parties have failed to express their sympathy, this proposal has been automatically withdrawn. Committee Member Wu Huanru reported, briefly stating: The rice-producing areas this year have indeed been affected by the drought, and the harvest has been reduced. When I attended the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan, there was a discussion on prevention beforehand and remedies afterward. I believe that the current food may not rise too much, to what extent, but when the next harvest season, there may be a risk of rising. Therefore, ordering foreign rice seems feasible, but the method should be discussed. Committee Member Lu Wenshao reported, briefly stating: I think that ordering foreign rice should be considered carefully. It is not appropriate for rice to be expensive, but it is also enough to hurt farmers for rice to be cheap. The rice industry has already expressed this. I believe that the price of old rice should be restricted, and the price of new rice may be slightly increased. Other committee members also expressed their opinions, which are omitted here.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Agreed Upon Methods <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After the reports from each committee member, the discussion of the proposed motions began. (1) Zhang Binghui proposed that due to the recent drought and impending famine, and the soaring rice prices in the city, a method should be devised to regulate the market to benefit the people's food supply. (2) Zhang Binghui proposed that the rice industry is considering purchasing foreign rice to prepare for famine. Should this be done, or should domestic rice be purchased from Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces first? Please discuss. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau submitted a proposal regarding the opinions of the rice industry on the rice supply, requesting a review and report for approval and implementation. The following methods were decided upon for the above three cases: (1) Rice prices should be limited, with a maximum price of thirteen yuan, and corresponding adjustments for lower grades. (2) Channels should be opened, and in addition to the rice merchants taking responsibility, the municipal government should consult with transportation authorities to facilitate the transportation of rice as quickly as possible. (3) Regarding the purchase of foreign rice, a survey of rice reserves in various regions should be conducted first. If necessary, rice merchants should purchase 500,000 shi of foreign rice on a forward contract. If losses occur in the future, the government will guarantee them and exempt import duties. If prices rise extremely high, in addition to paying import duties, the price of foreign rice will be restricted to stabilize the market. Detailed measures will be drafted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government, which will then consult with the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and jointly submit them to the central government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e108">District Farmers' Associations Met Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Discussing Disaster Relief Measures for Agricultural Disasters</p>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association convened a meeting of various district farmers' associations yesterday afternoon to discuss disaster relief measures for agricultural disasters. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Lu Dong of Gaoqiao District, Liu Zhaoxing of Wusong District, Gu Jinqing and Zhuang Yaocong of Fahua District, Wu Ruzhang of Caojing District, Hu Yingchun of Lixing District, Hu Zhusan of Yang'en District, Qu Xing of Gaohang District, Wang Hui of Tangqiao District, Xu Baoming of Yangjing District, Gu Tongchun of Pusong District, Shen Wenbin, Tang Guanchun, and He Ruiren of Zhabei District, Xing Guxiang of Yinxiang District, Hou Shizhang of Pengpu District, Pan Rongting and Zhu Hexiang of Huna District, and more than twenty others.</p>
<p>Reports from Each District: 1. Yu Zhenhui, Executive Director of the Municipal Farmers' Association, reported on the purpose of the discussion. (1) The implementation status of each district after the Municipal Government allocated funds. (2) Whether each district still needs water pumping. (3) Reimbursement of expenses and settlement of advance payments. 2. Lu Dong, representative of Gaoqiao District, reported that although the water pumps had been received for several days, they had not yet been put into operation because the length of the water pipes needed to be at least 60 feet and must wait for the decision of the Social Affairs Bureau before ordering from Shenchang Foreign Firm. The condition of the farmland requires water urgently. 3. Liu Zhaoxing, representative of Wusong District Farmers' Association, reported that the situation in Wusong is different from other districts due to the tidal water. Water pumping was in progress when there was timely rainfall, so manpower is no longer needed. The machinery was borrowed and the expenses advanced have reached more than one hundred yuan. 4. Wu Ruzhang, representative of Caojing District, reported that the district mainly grows edamame beans and less rice. Because the rivers are not interconnected, more machines are needed. 5. Hu Yingchun of Lixing District reported that the two heavy rains did not reach the area. The machines started pumping water yesterday, and the fuel is only enough for two days. The machines should be preserved for future needs. 6. Hu Zhusan of Yangsi District reported that the district had four or five rainfalls, but they were not significant. 7. Qu Xing of Gaohang District reported that the several heavy rains did not reach Gaohang, Gaoqiao, and Lixing. Although the machine is large, the amount of water pumped is not much, and the expenses advanced have reached more than one hundred yuan. 8. Wang Hui of Tangqiao District reported that one-third of all small rivers have been irrigated. The pumping started on the 6th, but the rainfall was scarce. Whether the machine is needed depends on the situation after the minor tide. 9. Gu Tongchun of Pusong District reported that the assigned machine could not pump water, so another machine was rented. There are a total of six dams, costing about one hundred and fifty yuan. Not only is the machine still needed, but it would be best to get a few more. 10. Shen Wenbin of Zhabei District reported that the machine is located in Yanjiabang, and the exact cost has not been determined. The need for water is no less than other districts. 11. Xing Guxiang of Yinxiang District reported that the district received three inches of rainfall and temporarily does not need water pumping. 12. Hou Shizhang of Pengpu District reported that at the beginning, fire engines were used to pump water for six days, providing more than ten yuan per day, which was not very beneficial. The machine has not yet been installed, and the need is gone due to the influence of the tide, and the expenses are high. 13. Zhuang Yaoming of Fahua District reported that the southern part of Fahua District suffered more severely. The northwest part has the Wusong River for irrigation. The main crops are cotton, beans, and vegetables. The demand for water for vegetables is high every day, and he requested that efforts be made to provide relief. 14. Pan Rongting of Huna District reported that the dam is in Shihui Port. The machine started pumping water on the 6th, but the horses are too small and not effective. Although the fire engine came, it was not used. The tide was blocked by the dam, which increased the inconvenience. The account is opened, please find a way to allocate it. 15. Xu Baoming of Yangjing District reported that the machine has not been received. There is no major problem along the shore because of the high tide. The disaster situation is serious from Qinci Yangdian to the junction of Gaohang and Nanhui. The Huacao Lian is dry for a long time, and fundamental solutions can be permanently effective.</p>

<p>(1) Request the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to allocate the funds advanced by each district for drought prevention in July. (2) The Municipal Farmers' Association will notify each district (such as Zhenru, Lixing, Tangqiao) to prepare a final account of drought prevention expenses for July within three days beyond the deadline and forward it. (3) If any district needs to continue pumping water in the future, the expenses should be allocated as requested. (4) Request the Municipal Government to specially deposit funds for drought prevention and surplus funds for urgent needs for drought prevention and treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Municipal Bureau of Finance Commences Collection of This Year's Early-Term Field Tax <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Deadline for Completion within Two Months</p>
<p>Overdue Surcharge for Late Payment</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Finance has scheduled the commencement of the collection of the early-term field tax for this year on August 1. The announcement is copied below: It is found that the field tax in this city has always been collected by converting the original busy transport at a discounted price. Subsequently, the "Silver Yuan Collection of Field Tax and Arrangement of Additional Field Tax" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance was followed, and starting in 1934, the original name of busy transport was abolished and collectively called field tax, which was divided into two items: regular tax and surtax. The original tax amount was still converted into silver yuan per mu, and collected in two terms, early and late. The original additional items collected were all incorporated into the surtax for internal calculation, and collected together with the regular tax at an average rate. If the surtax exceeded the regular tax, it was reduced separately to not exceed the regular tax. It has been submitted to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval. All early-term field taxes for 1934 are now scheduled to be collected on August 1 of this year. In the case of the autumn disaster exemption for 1933, 20% should be allowed for Wuusong and Yinxing Districts, 15% for Yinxiang District, 10% for Gaohang, Lixing, and Yangsi Districts, and 0.5% for Zhenru and Jiangwan Districts. The remaining districts will still be collected according to the fixed amount and detailed in the license. The deadline for completing this term's field tax is two months from the date of collection, deducted to September 30 of this year. Those who have not completed payment by the deadline will be charged an additional 10% for late payment. An additional two months will be continued, deducted to November 30 of this year. Those who still have not completed payment by the deadline will be charged an additional 10% to show late payment. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government for record and separately issuing letters, it is appropriate to issue a notice and announcement, so that everyone is aware of it and must go to the counter to complete payment within the time limit, obtain a license and settle down, and do not delay. This announcement.</p>

<p>Chinese Goods Are in Short Supply in the United States</p>
<p>The Association Decided to Ship on the 4th</p>
<p>Since China participated in the Century of Progress Exposition held in Chicago, USA, Chinese goods have achieved the greatest victory in the US market. For example, Jiangxi porcelain, Fujian lacquerware, and Qimen tribute products are sold out as soon as they arrive. Since the opening on May 26 this year, we have shipped six batches, totaling no less than 2,000 boxes. Now, the Association has received a telegram from overseas representatives Dong Kunfan and others, urging the immediate shipment of the seventh competition item to the United States in order to respond to the elegant intentions of the visitors. Therefore, the Association decided to ship more than 100 boxes of competition items to the United States on the 4th of this month with the Dale Company mail ship. At the same time, the representatives in the United States are still holding lectures every day in accordance with the fixed plan to promote China's industry and commerce, national politics, and women's issues, so that foreigners can thoroughly understand China's national conditions and not be blinded by deceptive policies.</p>

<p>Regarding the Attitude of Reorganizing the Shenxin Cotton Mill</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that the Shenxin Cotton Mill relief issue has been discussed back and forth by party and state elder Wu Zhihui and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, with letters exchanged. It is learned that Wuxi counterparts Lixin, Zhenxin, Guangqin, Yukang, Fuxing, Qingfeng, and other factories sent a telegram to President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Chen yesterday. Xinxin News Agency reporters now record its content below. To President Wang of the Executive Yuan: We have learned that Mr. Rong Zongjing's Shenxin Cotton Mill has recently been affected by the global economic downturn, resulting in sluggish economic turnover, so he has requested government approval for relief. After the application, Junyuan has been mindful of the national foundation and granted attention, which has inspired all the people. However, recent reports have repeatedly stated that the government is preparing to</p>
<h3 id="e119">Nationalize <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Shenxin and other factories, and the Ministry of Industry and the Cotton Control Association have sent personnel to investigate Shenxin's assets, and it seems that they are deliberately underestimating them. Rumors are rife, and the public is panicked. It is found that Shenxin's factories have always been commercial shares. This time, due to the global economic downturn, the financial situation is temporarily sluggish, which is a common phenomenon in the business world and is not the fault of the war. In this emergency, if the government can genuinely protect the country and the people with good intentions, then the resurgence and revival can be foreseen. However, the current plan of the Ministry of Industry does not mention relief but reorganization. Sending personnel to investigate does not mention investigation but estimation. The news in this is chilling. Taking the so-called estimation as an example, Shenxin No. 9 Factory was completed in October last year, covering more than 60 mu of factory land. According to the valuation of the Engineering Bureau, the land price is 25,000 yuan per mu, and the construction cost of the factory building is more than 2.2 million yuan. There are currently 80,000 yarn spindles, 15,000 thread spindles, and 500 looms. According to the current lowest market value, it should be more than 8 million yuan. However, after the investigation by the investigation committee of the Ministry of Industry and the Cotton Control Association, it was rashly estimated at only</p>
<p>more than 4 million yuan. Although we dare not say that there is another purpose, it is difficult to avoid arousing suspicion. In addition, the purchase price of each spindle in other factories is at least 30 yuan, but now it is estimated at 17 yuan, which is even more shocking. Fellow businessmen and textile merchants know better. If all yarn mills in the country are estimated at this price of 17 yuan, then no factory will not go bankrupt, and no factory will not need to be nationalized. In the past, China's industry suffered from the instability of national affairs and the government's lack of attention. Its plight was something that no country in the East or West could dream of. Now, fortunately, the military and government are unified, and we see prosperity again. The people and merchants of the whole country are looking forward to it. Mr. Rong has struggled hard for 30 years. In the past, there was more than one crisis, and the reason why he repeatedly overcame them was entirely dependent on the protection of the wise financial community. Now, the expression of the silver industry is still the same, but the wise government does not avoid the suspicion of cutting and plundering and rashly advocates nationalization, which will accelerate Shenxin's downfall. Regardless of whether Shenxin's management performance after being changed to state-owned can be better than private management and no longer repeat the previous government-run mistakes, it is difficult to predict. Even if we step back and say that the people have worked hard for their entire lives</p>
<p>The industry that has been painstakingly managed for 20 or 30 years, and the government can take advantage of its illness to nationalize it. Can it not make people feel cold in terms of law and reason? And in the future, who would dare to invest in industry again? Even if the government does not plan for the cultivation of industrialists, can it not plan for the country's enterprises? All these minor points are humble and trivial. We believe that Junzuo has already seen it. Today's rumors on the road really make the people and merchants hesitate, shake, and feel unable to stop speaking. Therefore, we pour out our feelings and present them to Jun, respectfully requesting that the Ministry of Industry be ordered to seriously consider maintaining the only remaining great achievement in the country, and finally hope that the law and reason will be complete, and both public and private interests will be taken care of, so that Shenxin will see a resurgence due to relief, and not let Shenxin accelerate its downfall due to plunder. Shenxin's fortune is also the country's fortune, and the future of industry relies on it.

<h3 id="e120">The Rickshaw Problem is Serious: The Management Committee Refuses to Issue New Licenses <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Were Refused Licenses at the Vehicle Inspection Office Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Trade Association Appeals to Various Organizations for Assistance in Negotiations</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that the public concession rickshaw problem is due to the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee's scheduled implementation of new regulations, and the rickshaw owners firmly oppose them because the burden is too heavy, creating a confrontation between the two sides. One hundred and forty-four rickshaw owners in the special zone went to the Gongping Road Vehicle Inspection Office yesterday morning to collect new licenses in accordance with the past licensing methods, but were refused issuance, making the situation more serious. It is speculated that if both sides continue to be extreme, then unfortunate events will occur in the near future. The details learned by the Xinxin News Agency reporters are recorded below.</p>
<p>Starting to Collect Licenses: Representatives of 144 rickshaw owners in the special zone went to the rickshaw inspection office to collect the vehicle inspection qualification certificate in accordance with the Municipal Council's regulations for decades, so that they could pay the donation to the Municipal Council's Donation Office and collect the August business license in order to do business. At 9:40 am yesterday morning, they gathered at the Special Zone Office of the Rickshaw Trade Association on Lloyd Road, led by rickshaw owner Gu Songmao and others, and took six moving trucks to the Gongping Road Vehicle Inspection Office to collect new licenses.</p>
<p>Refusal to Issue: After the rickshaw owners arrived at the vehicle inspection office, ten representatives were sent to request the issuance of new licenses so that they could pay the donation and collect the licenses for business. Director Si Huangjun (transliteration) received them and said that the office had received a rejection, etc.</p>
<p>Requesting Assistance: The rickshaw industry association, according to reports from the rickshaw owners, believes that the association intends to destroy the industry, so it decided to handle it in accordance with the resolution of the general meeting, depositing the donations to be paid in the bank, and sending letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayers Association, and the Municipal Council's Director-General for assistance. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully submitted, rickshaw owners have been operating the rickshaw industry for 50 years, inheriting it from generation to generation. They have been holding licenses from the Municipal Council, paying donations monthly, and contributing tens of thousands of dollars annually. The rickshaw regulations have always taken into account the obligations and rights of the rickshaw industry, so the rickshaw owners have been able to follow them carefully and have not changed them. Unexpectedly, due to the establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, all the previous regulations have been suddenly changed, and all of them are matters that cannot be followed. It seems that there are only obligations and no rights to speak of, and rickshaw owners are urged to directly collect licenses starting in August, which is even more incomprehensible. 1. It is found that the method of issuing licenses has always been that a small number of vehicles are donated on behalf of those with a larger number of vehicles, and the license applicant is required to prepare a store guarantee or cash on file. Now, without announcing the termination of liability and returning the certificate money, the rickshaw owners who donate on behalf of others are suddenly ordered to directly collect licenses. This is incomprehensible. 2. Rickshaws in the public concession travel throughout the three zones, so they should donate three zone licenses. However, the three zone licenses are all donated on behalf of others. This is a very systematic method of collecting licenses, which has been convenient for rickshaw owners and the authorities have easy procedures and no objections. Now, although the Municipal Council wants to order each to donate and collect licenses, the other two zones still need to be donated on behalf of others, which makes the rickshaw owners feel more troublesome in the procedures. This is incomprehensible. 3. Regarding the registered rickshaw owners, the names are not announced in advance, and the donor is not allowed to prove it. Only the rickshaw owner's self-registration is taken as the standard, and they are allowed to issue certificates and collect licenses based on the certificate. It is found that there are many genuine rickshaw owners living in other places. At this time, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no fake registrants. Even the certificates now state that "according to the rickshaw owner's claim, it is assumed temporarily," etc. And each rickshaw owner sent 180 rickshaw owner certificates issued by our committee, and there are more than 30 names that are wrong, totaling more than 177 vehicles. There are more than 700 lower joint certificates that have not been issued, and it is even more difficult to count the number of errors among them. How will disputes be resolved in the future? This is incomprehensible. 4. The Municipal Council originally ordered the rickshaw license regulations to be issued every three months as a means of collecting licenses on time. The autumn certificate has already been issued, noting that the valid period is July, August, and September. Suddenly, it changed in the middle, and only July can execute this license, and it will not take effect after that. This is incomprehensible. Based on the above reasons, the rickshaw owners are facing difficulties in the new regulations, strict old system, and unnecessary changes. The rickshaw owners have been donating for many years, and it is now the time to collect licenses in August. It is not a small matter that it is related to the Municipal Council's donation collection, the rickshaw owners' business, and the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods. Therefore, a special document is submitted to Junzuo (your association) for verification. All August vehicle licenses (please ask the Municipal Council) allow the rickshaw owners to still donate and collect licenses as before in order to maintain the rickshaw industry and to benefit the lives of more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers and their families. It is for the public good.</p>

<p>American Director Beek Completes Negotiations and Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Resumption of Shanghai-Guangdong Route Must Wait Until November</p>
<p>Riri News Agency reports that China Aviation Corporation plans to open the Shanghai-Philippines route to develop its business. In January of this year, the company's American Deputy Director Beek Siouxby went to the United States to negotiate, and the results were very satisfactory. Beek left Shanghai on the Dale Company's President Hoover liner in early July and arrived in port at 8 am yesterday morning. Riri News Agency reporters yesterday obtained details of the process from Huang Baoxian, the company's sales director, which are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Opening the Shanghai-Philippines Route: China Aviation Corporation intends to open the Shanghai-Philippines route in order to advance Sino-US commerce and develop its business. This entire plan was brought to the United States by the company's American director Beek Siouxby in the spring of this year for consultation with the authorities. As a result, the American side was very supportive and willing to provide strong assistance. Beek has now returned to Shanghai, and the company has begun preparing everything, such as ordering new aircraft and measuring the route along the way. Various tasks are underway separately, but this matter cannot be successful without more than a year of preparation, so it is difficult to predict when it will open. To</p>
<p>Resuming the Shanghai-Guangdong Route: There are rumors that it will open in August or September. The company also hopes so, but in order to ensure the safety of the voyage, a meteorological station and a radio station have been installed in Xiangshan. In the future, when it opens, the climate there can be reported to the company by radio at any time. Personnel have now been sent to survey and begin installation. The opening date is expected to be in November of this year, because the new aircraft purchased will be shipped to Shanghai at that time.</p>

At that time, it was publicized that the ship would open foreign routes to add glory to China's shipping industry. However, after the ship arrived in Shanghai, the shipowner Zeng Guangqing leased it to the Japanese for Japanese merchants to expand their shipping business in the South Seas Islands. It is said that the conditions are very harsh. The shipowner was originally a Westerner. Today, the Japanese request that Chinese people not be used as shipowners and that Japanese people be used as shipowners. Zeng has expressed his agreement. Only three Chinese officers are used on the ship: Chief Mate Cai Liang, Second Mate Chen Maihao, and Radio Officer Huang Nanchu. The rest are all Japanese. Yesterday, Cai Chen and others disembarked and went to Keelung, Taiwan, to deliver the ship to the Japanese merchants. The Japanese shipowner received it in Keelung.

<p>Problem of Overdrafts for Telegraphs from Postal Savings</p>
<p>Regarding the "Contract for Agency Collection and Payment of Funds and the Overdraft Loan for Long-Distance Telephone in Nine Provinces and Jiangsu Province" recently concluded between the Ministry of Communications and the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances, the Shanghai Postal Service Association and the Postal Workers' Association, in the interest of the safety of public savings, considered it inappropriate to have substantial overdrafts from postal savings for the telegraph bureau without effective guarantees. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the Ministry a few days ago to request rectification to protect the interests of public savings. However, the remarks made by the person in charge of the Ministry of Communications and Mr. Xu Baiyuan of the local Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau denied the substantial overdrafts. Yesterday, committee members of the two postal service associations stated that postal savings are accumulated from the small amounts of hard-earned savings of the public, so the government has specifically enacted the Postal Savings Law, with particularly careful management. In addition to the contract for agency collection and payment of funds concluded between the Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications and the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances, there is also a contract for overdraft loans with ten articles, of which articles 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 have not been announced, and their contents are unknown, which is cause for concern. However, according to reports from various places, such as Zhejiang Province's total revenue from telegram and telephone charges in July was 3,216.07 yuan, while the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau paid out 11,252 yuan for telegraphs. Changsha's revenue was 8,000 yuan, while its payments were 12,000 yuan. Jinan, Shandong's revenue from wired and wireless telegram charges was 9,000 yuan, while its expenditures were 15,000 yuan. In addition, Qingdao's expenditures for wired and wireless telegrams were 15,600 yuan, and Yantai's telegraph expenditures were 12,000 yuan, while its telephone charges were 3,200 yuan. Tianjin receives a subsidy of 50,000 yuan each month from the Savings and Remittances Bureau for the telegraph bureau, and Beijing receives 120,000 yuan in July. The above only represents a small portion of the revenue and expenditures nationwide, and the amount of overdrafts is already so large. If calculated nationwide, the so-called overdraft of 500,000 yuan per month is definitely unfounded. However, according to Mr. Xu Baiyuan of the Savings and Remittances Bureau, he also admitted that the contract stipulates that the Telegraph Administration can overdraft 100,000 yuan, yet he falsely accused the telegram from the two associations of being groundless, which is self-contradictory. In short, the two associations, in order to protect the interests of public savings due to the inappropriate nature of the contract, have petitioned the Ministry of Communications to pay attention, which is their duty. However, in his remarks, Mr. Xu's attitude towards the two associations was arrogant and his language was rude, only demeaning himself. The two associations do not wish to argue with him.</p>

Committee member Zhao Shusheng reported on the deduction of union dues by the authorities in the bandit suppression areas of five provinces and the negotiations with the National Postal Workers' General Union. 5. Matters for discussion: (1) The Ministry of Communications, during the trial period of the joint postal and telegraph setup, the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances and the Telegraph Administration concluded a contract for the postal service to collect and pay for telegrams, and the postal savings authorities stated that they could overdraft 100,000 yuan per month. This measure violates the principle of independent postal economics and harms the interests of postal savings depositors. In order to maintain postal economics and ensure the safety of savings, how should this be expressed for public decision? Resolved: A. The joint postal and telegraph setup violates the principle of independent economics, so a petition should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications to suspend it. B. The postal and telegraph revenue and expenditure contract lacks effective guarantees for overdrafts, which hinders the safety of savings. A petition should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications to cancel the revenue and expenditure contract, carefully manage the use of postal savings, maintain postal credit, and protect public savings. (2) Regarding the case of merging savings and remittance bureaus, which has been passed by the Legislative Yuan but has not yet been implemented, how should it proceed? Resolved: A. A report should be submitted to the Central Political Council to promptly review and implement the original plan passed by the Legislative Yuan. B. A report should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to request detailed information and to forward it to the Central Political Council for prompt review and approval. (3) Recently, it was reported that the postal authorities announced a postal deficit of over ten million yuan, while in the 23rd accounting year, the post office still subsidized airlines by more than 1.4 million yuan, increasing the postal deficit. The Ministry of Communications should be requested to immediately stop the subsidy in accordance with the decision of the Postal Economics System Research Committee. Resolved: Passed. (4) The postal service has been established for more than thirty years, with unified authority and all facilities operating in accordance with the orders of the communications authorities. However, the Ministry of Communications has decided to convene a national postal conference in the capital on September 1, and the purpose of the conference is unknown. Moreover, this conference is related to the entire postal service and is very important, but employee organizations have not been invited to participate. How should this be expressed? Resolved: Request the Ministry of Communications to announce the purpose of the meeting and request permission to send representatives to participate in the meeting. (5) Recently, in the bandit suppression areas of five provinces, the postal authorities suddenly stopped deducting postal union dues, which hinders postal transportation. How should this be handled? Resolved: A. A petition should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications, firmly requesting that the post office be ordered to deduct dues as usual. B. A telegram should be sent to Chairman Chiang, explaining the special circumstances of the postal union and that dues should be collected as usual. (6) (7) Not announced. (8) How should the above resolutions be handled? Resolved: Handed over to the standing committees of the two associations for active handling. 6. Meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Municipal Government Instructs the Social Affairs Bureau to Suppress the Private Issuance of Currency <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "The Ministry of Finance's document Qian Zi No. 6258 states that in the resolution presented by the secretariat of the National Finance Conference, member Xu Kan proposed suppressing the private minting of silver and copper coins and the private issuance of paper money in order to purify the currency system. After review, it was deemed essential and proposed that the Ministry, in accordance with existing laws and regulations, inform the provinces to effectively suppress it. The examination opinion was submitted, and the fourth general meeting resolved to adopt the examination opinion. The central government has already made overall plans and established a framework for currency consolidation, and the provinces and cities must cooperate and assist in earnest execution to ensure compliance with central government policies to achieve synergistic results. The Ministry has previously ordered provincial mints to destroy old dies and has repeatedly ordered provincial and municipal governments to strictly suppress private minting and issuance. However, some local governments still have privately established minting institutions or privately open furnaces in existing mints to mint silver coins, silver dollars, and copper coins. Local banks, money shops, and businesses still privately issue paper money for exchange of silver dollars and copper coins or similar paper vouchers, which seriously hinders the unification of the currency system, disrupts financial stability, and harms the local area. The National Finance Conference, recognizing this, proposed suppressing private minting and issuance to purify the currency system. Resolved: The Ministry should, in accordance with existing laws and regulations, inform the provinces to effectively suppress it. The Ministry should follow this resolution and instruct the municipal government to investigate whether banks, money shops, and businesses within its jurisdiction are privately printing and issuing paper money for exchange of silver dollars and copper coins or similar paper vouchers. If such paper money exists, it should be redeemed, recovered, and destroyed within three months of receiving the document, and no further issuance should be allowed. Regarding the suppression of private minting of silver and copper coins, the municipal government should investigate whether there are privately established mints or existing mints privately opening furnaces to mint silver and copper coins. If such private minting exists, it should be ordered to cease minting within one month of receiving the document, and the dies should be sent to the Ministry for verification and destruction. Regarding the above two items, it is hoped that the municipal government will cooperate and assist in earnest execution. If this can be achieved, it will not only alleviate the people's suffering but also greatly benefit the administrative power. In addition to separate notifications, a corresponding notification is hereby issued for investigation, instruction to subordinates to comply, and a report on the suppression situation is requested to be submitted at any time."</p>

<p>Transferred by the United Relief Association</p>
<p>The Northeastern Refugees Relief United Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations, which previously operated the Army Hospitality Center, closed on the 16th. Except for the 44 family members of Wang Delin's troops, who were taken over by Wang's representatives, there were three family members of Ma Zhanshan's troops who temporarily remained with Wang's troops and had not been properly settled. After the association sent representatives to negotiate with General Li Du, he agreed to receive and manage them. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to Wang Delin, transferring Zhou Yang and the other three to Li's care, and sent a letter along with the association's severance pay of 150 yuan to Li for acceptance and management. The original letters from the United Relief Association to Wang and Li are recorded below:</p>
<p>To Wang Delin: Dear Sir, We previously received your letter stating that the three family members of Ma Bu, Zhou Yang, Zhou Lihuan, and Yang Sun, should be the responsibility of one party after the final closing. We have sent representatives to negotiate with General Li Du, who has agreed to be responsible for their management. We have specially sent our staff member Ge Yunsun to bring Zhou Yang and the other three to General Li Du for acceptance. We hope you will hand them over to clear the procedures. Sincerely, Wang Delin.</p>
<p>To Li Du: Dear Sir, Our Northeastern Generals' Family Hospitality Center has now been closed and separately compensated. Among them, three family members of General Ma Zhanshan, Zhou Yang, Zhou Lihuan, and Yang Sun, could not be compensated. We sent our staff member Ge Yunsun to visit you and negotiate the matter. You agreed to take them in and be responsible for their management, showing your enthusiasm for assistance and care for others, for which we are deeply grateful. We are now sending Zhou Yang and the other three, along with the association's severance pay of 150 yuan (60 yuan per adult, 30 yuan per child), for your inspection and acceptance. Please manage them properly. Sincerely, Li Zhichu.</p>

<p>1,200 New Books Sold at Half Price</p>
<p>Held for Two Months from August 1st</p>
<p>The Commercial Press of this city has been in operation for two years since its resumption of business. Its production capacity has been restored, and all the books destroyed in the January 28th Shanghai Incident have generally been reprinted. More than 1,000 new books have also been published since the resumption of business. To commemorate this, over 1,200 newly reprinted and newly published books are being offered at half price for two months. The half-price books cover all subjects (including 10 dictionaries and thesauruses) and are displayed gradually. Sales are limited to in-person or mail-order purchases, and each person is limited to one copy of each title. This half-price offer is uniformly applied at the Shanghai main branch and all branch offices. The publishing house and the three branches on Jing'an Temple Road, Xiafei Road, and Hongkou in this city have been scheduled to hold the event from August 1st and will display over 300 half-price books in the first week. According to an employee of the publishing house, the publishing house usually sells inexpensive books at around 20% off, and most of them are local sales. The fact that the new books offered this time are as many as 1,000 or more and are all sold at half price is unprecedented. In addition, with 500 copies of each discounted book, the total sacrifice of the publishing house for this commemorative half-price sale amounts to tens of thousands of yuan. From the perspective of the reading public, it can save tens of thousands of yuan in book prices, which is an excellent opportunity to purchase and read new books.</p>

<p>Combining Various Reasons</p>
<p>Not Only Due to Relaxed Boycott</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 26th that, since the surprising leap in trade with Manchuria, trade with China has been very weak due to various reasons. However, since the second half of the year, all shipping routes have suddenly become active. The Jing Shan Maru, which departed from Osaka on the 24th on the Dagu-Kobe-Tianjin line, loaded 1,000 tons of rice in Kobe, 450 tons of sugar in Osaka, Kobe, and Moji, and 300 tons of printing paper. The round trips of the Beiling Maru are always full of exports. Other shipping lines, such as the shipping company's sea line, are also actively exporting sugar and cotton. This situation has not been seen in the past two or three years. The reasons for this are: (1) China's revised tariffs have reduced tax rates and removed trade uncertainties; (2) The restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations has eased and eliminated the rejection of Japanese goods; (3) Sino-Japanese exchange rates have stabilized; (4) The strike of dockworkers in the North Pacific has halted US trade with China, which is sufficient to increase Japanese goods exports to China.</p>

<p>Heavy Sentence Still Given After Retrial, Public Anger Difficult to Appease</p>
<p>Patriots Imprisoned for a Long Time, Please Reverse Unjust Verdicts</p>
<p>The Dagon News Agency reported that the Patriotic People Support Committee, due to the heavy sentences still imposed on patriotic people Liu Chongwu and others after the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial, convened an emergency meeting the other day and resolved that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, the General Labour Union, various labour unions, the first and second urban districts joint community associations, and various area subcommittees, various clan associations, and two hundred other organizations together petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Judicial Administrative Department, and the Judicial Yuan requesting a pardon. The original petition stated, "Petition for Patriotic People Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, etc., being sentenced to heavy penalties still in place following retrial by the High Court, inciting the public anger and disquiet. Pray and beseech from a position of loyalty that a pardon will be delivered to uphold the soul of the country to comfort the people and the nation. From the time the Japanese invaded the Northeast and poisoned Shanghai, eating it like a silkworm and swallowing it like a whale, and with no end in sight, our people across the nation have reached the limit of endurance. Grieving that the nation is on the cusp of collapse, they sought to save the desperate situation. Soldiers vowed to fight to the death, merchants vowed to sever ties, and all matters relating to benefitting the nation and resisting the enemy were simultaneously roused.</p>

<p>People sharing the same heart, saving the nation, there is no avoidance of duty and responsibility. The circumstances demand, even should it mean passing through fire, such is the willingness to sacrifice all. It is not appropriate to then impose a measured response such as careful deliberations, comprehensive analysis or weighing the profit and loss as if at times of peace and plenty, when there is time to calculate the risks, gains and consequences. In the winter of the twenty-first year of the Republic, patriots Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, et al., enraged by the treacherous merchants collaborating with the enemy, and angered by the dumping of enemy goods, causing the national products to fail and the people to lose hope, rather than sit and wait for death, roused themselves to survive. However, obstacles abounded, and it was difficult to achieve results. Therefore, even legitimate work could only be carried out in secret. The cause of the Liu case was entirely patriotic and to uphold national goods. The treacherous merchants lost their minds to greed, actively brokering for enemy goods, leaving no room for high quality national products. Efforts to promote such ideas failed to register. Thus, dangerous items, in a sense, became the last line of warning. Yet, at that moment a fire broke out, an unexpected disaster struck, thus...</p>

<p>A great injustice which cannot be righted to this day. The case was first brought to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court by the lawyer Gan Jingxian, representing the criminal division of the Shanghai Public Concession’s Ministry of Public Works. The first instance ruled that Liu Chongwu be sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou to three months each, suspended for three years, and Tian Shuiyang to two months, suspended for three years. Lawyer Gan was not satisfied and appealed on the charge of premeditated murder. In July of last year, the First Branch of the Jiangsu High Court ruled in the second instance that the original sentence be revoked, and Liu, Pan, and Cao were all sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for conspiring to commit murder. Tian Shuiyang was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for assisting in the murder. At that time, people from all walks of life believed that the trial was improper and convened a committee to support the patriots and resolved that various organizations would separately petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Judicial Administrative Department, and the Judicial Yuan for relief, and hired four lawyers, Ma Junshuo, Zhang Shizhao, Yu Hualong, and Li Shirui, to file...</p>

<p>...to the Supreme Court, to highlight the injustices. In July of this year, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial. The retrial resulted in Liu Chongwu being sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Tian Shuiyang and Pan Hongsheng to six years of imprisonment, and Cao Songshou still to twelve years of imprisonment. People from all walks of life believed that the sentences were still too severe and convened an emergency meeting on the day of the Patriotic Support Committee and resolved that, in addition to the original lawyers appealing to the Judicial Yuan, various organizations would jointly file petitions requesting relief. It is believed that the actions of Liu Chongwu and others were not permitted by law, but the purpose of Liu and others was supported by the people across the nation. In short, Liu and others' loyalty to the country is obvious, and it was neither private revenge nor intentional killing. Public conscience and justice still exist, and we must not allow these patriots to be imprisoned for a long time. If those who harm the country are still granted leniency, while those who love the country are heavily punished, then right and wrong are reversed...</p>

Therefore, in addition to hiring the original lawyers to request the Judicial Yuan to rectify the situation according to law, we are again submitting the facts and earnestly requesting your (Ministry), (Government), (Yuan) to grant a pardon.

<p>The China Travel Service of This City Claims</p>
<p>The Person Who Came Impersonated a Servant of Song Ziwen</p>
<p>The China Travel Service sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, We have read the news item in today's issue of your newspaper, 'A Travelling Companion's Two Small Leather Suitcases Lost.' Upon investigation, the luggage in question was entirely consigned by Director Chen Qingwen of the Beining Railway Bureau and was absolutely not the property of Director Yin. We are now providing a detailed account of the actual circumstances of the loss of four of the items and hope that you will grant us a correction to clarify the facts and avoid confusing the listeners: On the 28th of this month, Mr. Chen Qingwen, Director of the Traffic Department of the Beining Railway, returned to Shanghai by ship 'Lai Pula' after completing his private affairs in Singapore, bringing 24 pieces of luggage with him. That night, he entrusted them to our company to be sent directly from the wharf to the station for transport to Tianjin. Except for 20 of them, which were tagged and loaded onto the baggage car according to regulations, the remaining two pieces of food and two small leather suitcases were intended to be carried by Mr. Chen as carry-on luggage. About half an hour before the departure of the night train, a person resembling a servant suddenly approached our North Station reception desk and claimed to have been sent by the Song Ziwen residence to greet Director Chen and asked about the number of Director Chen's berth on the train. At that time, our receptionist did not suspect anything and accompanied the luggage to the train and temporarily placed it in room 508. The receptionist then got off the train to perform his duties. About five minutes before the departure, the receptionist, not seeing Director Chen arrive at the station, rushed back to the train to check on the luggage. According to the train attendant, the servant claimed that room 508 was reserved for Mr. Chen Weiqing and not for Director Chen, so he moved the four pieces of luggage to another sleeping car. The receptionist then searched all the rooms for the luggage without success, and the departure time had arrived, so he had to get off the train and search for it at various stations along the way, but without finding any clues. He also inquired at the Song residence and learned that no servants had been sent to the station. Therefore, the luggage must have been swindled and lost. Our company is now making every effort to investigate in the hope of uncovering the truth." China Travel Service.</p>

<p>Rouge and Perfume Surpass Previous Consumption</p>
<p>Imports Reach 850,000 in Six Months</p>
<p>Last year, the total import volume of women's products, namely perfume and rouge, exceeded 1.5 million, mostly consumed by women in Shanghai. This was quite astonishing. Consequently, amidst alarm and self-reflection, the women's community in Shanghai initiated the "Women's National Goods Year" campaign. However, according to reports from the Datong News Agency, repeated inquiries to the International Trade Bureau revealed that the import volume of rouge and perfume this year has not decreased. The natural preferences of Shanghai women are evident. Yesterday morning, the International Trade Bureau further announced the total import volume of perfume and rouge for the first six months of this year, amounting to 430,984 gold units, equivalent to 852,486 yuan in national currency. Compared to the total import volume of over 1.5 million for the entire last year, there is a clear trend of surpassing previous consumption. The import volume of perfume and rouge in June alone reached 70,334 gold units, equivalent to 144,044 yuan in national currency, also higher than the same month last year. At the same time, the Bureau also discovered the amount of lace used by fashionable women to adorn clothing, which is even more astonishing. The total import volume for the first six months of this year is 292,195 gold units, equivalent to 577,962 yuan in national currency, a significant increase compared to the same period last year. The import volume in June alone reached 32,922 gold units, equivalent to 67,424 yuan in national currency. The consumption of a mere clothing embellishment, approaching nearly 600,000 yuan in half a year, is enough to make one yearn for such luxury.</p>

<p>Li Shuqing Demands Debt Payment, Zheng Bei Starts Trouble</p>
<p>Song Yongfa Surrenders to Police Station After Committing the Crime</p>
<p>Li Shuqing, a 31-year-old resident of Shanghai from Tianjin, residing at No. 22, Sandeli, Lujiazui, Pudong, made a living working in an elevator at a certain company. His wife remained in their hometown with his father, farming. Recently, Li's father sent his daughter-in-law to Shanghai but wanted to return to his hometown alone. Li, facing financial difficulties and lacking travel expenses, remembered that his cousin Song Yongfa's sister-in-law, Song Songshi, had borrowed several yuan from him in the past. So, around 9 PM the previous evening, he went to Song's home at No. 12, Wufu Alley, to demand repayment to cover his father's travel expenses back home. Song had no money to repay at the time, and the two began to argue. Song Yongfa, the sister-in-law’s uncle, lived in the same house and was already asleep. Hearing the noise, he came out to help his sister-in-law argue. Neither side would yield. Li, in a fit of anger, threw a teacup at Yongfa's head, breaking his forehead. Yongfa, in a sudden rage, grabbed a noodle-cutting knife about two feet long and, without asking the reason, violently chopped at Li's right neck, penetrating two inches deep. His trachea severed, Li fell to the ground, dying instantly. Yongfa, realizing the gravity of the crime, immediately took the murder weapon and surrendered to the police officer on duty. The police took his sister-in-law, Songshi, and the deceased's uncle, Song Fujin, to the police station's Third Squad, which transferred them to the Third District. After District Chief Zhang inquired about the cause, he ordered the uncle and sister-in-law to be detained. Yesterday morning, he ordered the local guarantor, Lu Shunlong, to petition the local court. At 2 PM, Inspector Kong was appointed to go to Pudong to examine the body. The body was handed over to the deceased's father for funeral arrangements. The two defendants and the murder weapon were taken to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council to Stop It</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council yesterday, which stated: "Sir, according to a letter from the accounting department of the Sanxin Company, 'Our company has three fire hydrants installed at the Rongchangli houses on Dongyouheng Road. We pay a water fee of 3.75 yuan per quarter, calculated at a 60% discount of the original price of 6.25 yuan. This water is installed for public safety. Usually we do not use even a tiny amount of it. Now we have received a letter from the water company stating that a new contract must be signed for these hydrants, with a price of 6.25 yuan each, totaling 18.75 yuan per quarter for three, which is more than a fivefold increase. Before the contract is signed, they are temporarily charging 80% of 6.25 yuan per hydrant, which is 15 yuan per quarter for three, still a fourfold increase. When we inquired about the reason, they said that if all houses use the company's water, the old price can be paid (i.e., 3.75 yuan per quarter for three). Our company uses its own well water and must follow the new contract.' Their intention is clearly coercion. If Shanghai does not use the company's water materials, why should we be at their mercy? Moreover, the installation of fire hydrants is a water company monopoly and cannot be compared to other businesses. Profiting in this way may seriously affect public safety. We have always admired your council as the voice of the people, especially enthusiastic in handling social affairs. Therefore, we dare to state the facts as above, and hope that you will raise an objection. We would be most grateful.' This matter has reached the Association. The Association believes that the installation of fire hydrants is intended to prevent fires. The regular fee should only be called installation or maintenance fee. The water used to extinguish fires should certainly be charged. This has nothing to do with the use of household water from wells and is completely unrelated to whether or not tap water is used. Now, the charging difference is based on the distinction between household well water and tap water. We do not know under what legal or human rationale this regulation is based. It is appropriate to say it is 'nothing but coercion.' Accordingly, we are writing to request your bureau to instruct the water company to cancel this discrimination as necessary."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Customs' detention of civilian ships carrying dried fish, has sent a letter requesting their release. Now, it has learned that the Customs is still detaining newly arrived fishing boats. The Chamber specially telegraphed the Customs Administration yesterday, ordering a swift release to maintain the fishing industry. The original text is recorded below: "To the esteemed Customs Administration in Nanjing, civilian ships transporting dried fish from Zhangzi Island, Dagu Mountain, and Xiaogu Mountain are allowed to import duty-free according to the five articles of the regulations established by your Administration. Previously, eight ships, including the Jin Shunxing, etc., transported dried fish from the three islands to Shanghai and were detained by Customs, who demanded full tax payment. After sending a letter to the Customs Commissioner to request release, we were informed that the goods would be returned, but the ships would be detained. Three subsequent ships are also being treated the same way. This action affects the fishing industry. We request to know according to which article of the regulations the Customs Commissioner is acting. We have not yet received a response. We request that your Administration provide a clear statement of the regulations and instruct the Shanghai Customs to release the detained ships as soon as possible. Respectfully, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Thirtieth."</p>

<p>According to the regulations of the First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai, confiscated narcotics such as opium are destroyed by burning every three months.

<h3 id="e147">First Batch of Fruit Shipped to England for Trial Sale Achieves Excellent Results <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Second Shipment Currently Being Planned</p>
<p>Many Difficulties Exist, Requiring Immediate Remedies</p>
<p>The Fruit Industry Association of this city, recognizing that the quality of fruit produced in our country is excellent, but foreigners rarely buy and eat it due to a lack of promotion, deems it necessary to find ways to promote it abroad to expand the overseas market. Therefore, this spring, a large batch of Tianjin pears, chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, dried dates, and other fruits were shipped to Liverpool, England, for a trial sale. Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the Association, most of the first batch of goods shipped to Liverpool, England, for trial sale have been sold out, and the British highly praised them. The second batch of goods is being planned, and besides Tianjin pears which still need further promotion, there may be slight changes to the other goods. Regarding the difficulties in selling abroad, the first is the lack of overseas postal ships from our country, and the high cost of loading and unloading foreign ships is truly alarming. In fact, merchants simply cannot afford it, making it difficult for the price of our fruit to compete with foreign fruits. Secondly, the long distances make the fruit easily spoiled, resulting in heavy losses. Currently, if our country's fruit industry needs to gain a market abroad, the government should provide full assistance to alleviate shipping costs as the first point of difficulty. Merchants can find their own remedies for the second point of difficulty, it is said.</p>

<p>Reported to the Water Patrol Team for Attention and Investigation</p>
<p>The Guangxiang steamer, traveling between Shanghai and Haimen, left Pier No. 5, No. 16 South City, Shanghai, around 5 PM on the 29th of this month. While passing the Huangpu River off Zhanghuabang, a male passenger suddenly stepped onto the sampan next to the steamer's third-class cabin, and, taking advantage of the lack of preparedness, sighed loudly and jumped into the river. It was 6:40 PM, with the setting sun shining and the current very strong. Although the crew on the ship noticed and immediately stopped the ship to try to rescue him, the passenger had disappeared. His name, age, origin, and background are unknown. Shortly afterward, the steamer continued its journey to Haimen. Upon returning to this port yesterday, the crew reported the incident to the steamer's office, which sent a letter to the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting attention and investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Debt Collection Leads to Murder <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Debtor Li Shuqing Chopped to Death</p>
<p>Creditor Song Yongfa Arrested for the Crime</p>
<p>Li Shuqing, a Tianjin native residing at No. 12, Wufu Alley, Yanchang Road, Lujiazhai, Pudong, had previously borrowed dozens of yuan from Song Yongfa, a relative who lived in the same house and cut paper, due to financial difficulties. He had not yet repaid it. At 9:20 PM the previous evening, Song demanded repayment of the debt. Li, unable to repay it at that time, caused a dispute. Initially, it was just a verbal argument at Li's house, but due to disagreement, it turned into a physical fight between the two. Li first threw a rice bowl at Song, hitting him in the forehead and causing profuse bleeding. Realizing that he had caused trouble, he fled in fear of punishment. Song, harboring resentment, took a knife and chased him to the door. When Li turned to resist, he was accurately struck on the right side of his neck with a fierce chop. The wound was quite deep. He collapsed instantly, dying on the spot. The deceased's uncle, Song Fuqin, reported the incident to Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He immediately ordered Patrol Officer and Detective Team Leader Li Youbao, stationed in the Third District, along with detectives Jiang Binru and Chen Jinshan, to rush to the scene of the incident with the No. 6 patrol officer. They arrested the murderer, Song Yongfa, and his sister-in-law, Song Songshi, and took them to the district for detention. After a brief interrogation at the bureau this morning, District Chief Zhang, considering the case involved a death, ordered that a document be prepared to send the Song defendants to Section 3 of the main bureau for legal action this afternoon. At the same time, he instructed the local guarantor to request the local court to inspect and collect the body.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Li Jianyun Secretly Signed a Divorce Agreement Before His Death <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>His Wife Demanded 50,000 Yuan Before Agreeing to Divorce</p>
<p>Li's Wife, née Lu, Published a Denial in the Newspaper After the Matter Was Exposed</p>
<p>Li Jianyun, a native of Nanhui, Pudong, and the owner of the Chuntai Cooperative Construction Company at No. 810, the corner of Xiaoshadu Road and Haifang Road, unexpectedly shot and wounded his beloved concubine, Chen Zhanlian, the previous morning. Chen Zhanlian died from her wounds. He then committed suicide. Neither survived. After receiving the report, the Gordon Road police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. The bodies were sent to the Fellen Road morgue for autopsy. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Li had a legal wife named Lu Lingxian, with whom he had four children, all living with their mother in their hometown. Last year, after Li began an affair with Chen and cohabited with her, he planned to abandon Lu and marry Chen as his official wife. However, Lu demanded 50,000 yuan before agreeing to a divorce, while Li was only willing to give 5,000 yuan. The difference was too great, and it was not implemented. In November of last year, Li went to lawyer Sun Zuji several times, falsely claiming that he had paid Lu 3,000 yuan and agreed to a divorce. On the 17th of that month, he took two seals, his own and Lu's, and asked lawyer Sun to certify an agreement of divorce. But in April of this year, the matter was exposed, and Lu immediately published a denial in the newspaper. As a result, the plan to marry Chen never materialized. On the 27th of this month, Chen suddenly received a letter from her brother, Chen Moqian, urging her to marry Li. Both of them must have had unspeakable pain in their hearts, which led to this tragedy. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court received the report and dispatched Inspector Tang Peiyou, along with two forensic doctors, Wei Qiu and Wang Zuyi, to the scene to verify the bodies. According to Li Xianglin, the deceased Li Jianyun was his brother, previously a pattern maker and currently unemployed, residing in his hometown. Recently, he came to Shanghai for medical treatment because of illness and stayed in the hospital. Chen Zhanlian was deeply loved by his brother. Recently, Chen's brother wanted to persuade them to marry, which may have led to this unfortunate event. He now requests that his brother's body be given to him for collection, and Chen's body will be claimed by her nephew. According to Zhao Zhou, a servant in the Li family, around 8 AM this morning, she went upstairs to fetch a chamber pot and saw that the young master had already gotten up, while the young mistress was still lying in bed. So, she hurried to fetch washing water. At that time, she did not see any movement. Later, she went downstairs and suddenly heard a gunshot, but she couldn't tell what it was and thought something had happened on the road, so she didn't go to look. Later, the chauffeur brought a piece of paper, saying that he wanted to get gasoline and asked her to ask the young master to sign it. Only then did she discover that both of them were lying in pools of blood. She reported it to the police. According to Du Yingxi, the deceased Chen Zhanlian was his aunt, and he was willing to claim the body. After the Chinese and foreign detectives reported the above situation, Tang 君 ordered that the deceased Li Jianyun, male, and the deceased Chen Zhanlian, female, both died from gunshot wounds sustained during their lifetime. The male body was handed over to Li Xianglin, and the female body was handed over to Du Yingxi, with separate guarantees to claim them back for coffin burial.</p>
<p>Although Madame Wu, also known as Ergou, is middle-aged, her charm has not diminished. Her name is known to almost everyone in the Cantonese community. Wu is exceptionally skilled, and the prostitutes she keeps are all beauties. The villa is decorated with extreme opulence, so patrons flock to it like geese, and they are all high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants, and comprador of foreign firms. Therefore, over the years, Ergou has accumulated a lot of wealth and has retired from prostitution. She has become acquainted with a large real estate merchant and acts only as a procuress. On the 20th of this month, Wu Genyuan, the inspector of the Public Concession Western District Police, learned of the situation and ordered his subordinates to arrest Ergou and several prostitutes and send them to the First Special Court for sentencing. After Ergou was released from detention, she became more secretive but continued to operate the prostitution business in secret. Unexpectedly, at 10 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Wen Youheng of the Hongkou Police Station went to raid the villa with a search warrant from the First Special Court. At that time, there were three patrons inside having fun. All three were from Guangdong. One of them could only speak English and not Chinese, and seemed to be an overseas Chinese. One was rumored to be a comprador of a certain bank. The detective arrested Ergou and five prostitutes: Wang A'mei, Lu A'zhen, Chen A'mei, Zhu A'zhen, and Chen Liu'mei. The sixth prostitute, Liu'mei, was richly dressed and beautiful. All six were taken back to the police station and transferred to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court, and were charged with violations of Article 36 of the Municipal Council Bylaws and Article 43 of the Police Penalty Law. After Detective Wen explained the circumstances of the arrest, interrogations of Ergou revealed cunning lies. Wang A'mei and Lu A'zhen claimed to be dancers who were visiting sisters yesterday. Chen A'mei and others claimed to be servants. Judge Shen checked their fingerprints and discovered that both Ergou and Chen A'mei had been fined for prostitution before, so they could not lie. He sentenced Wu Ergou to a fine of 15 yuan and the rest to 10 yuan as a warning.</p>

<p>Xinzha Bridge connects the Concession in the south with the Chinese territory of Zhabei in the north, making it an important thoroughfare between the Chinese and Concession territories. After the Lu-Qi War in 1914, the authorities found that the sidewalks on both sides of the bridge were dangerous. To prevent accidents, the sidewalks were removed, leaving only the center of the bridge, and heavy vehicles are still not allowed to pass. Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been hot, and small vendors and laborers, who live in cramped rooms, cannot sleep well at night, so they all lounge on the bridge to cool off. They are repeatedly driven away and return. To avoid accidents, District Chief Gong has specially posted a notice saying, "The bridge is narrow, and vehicles are dangerous. No lounging on the bridge."</p>

<p>Huang Naiwu and Jiang Ada Each Sentenced to Ten Months' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Huang Naiwu, a 22-year-old university student from Jiangxi, had a grudge against Li Xiuying (also known as Gui Zhen, 21 years old this year), a dancer from the Da Hu Dance Hall on Haige Road in Tianjin. On June 20, Huang bought a bottle of nitric acid and incited Jiang Ada, a Suzhou native he knew, to splash the acid on Li at the Da Hu Dance Hall that evening. Huang first went to the dance hall and danced with Li three times. Li, noticing that Huang's actions were strange and unable to bear his harassment, retreated to the restroom to hide. Huang then danced with another dancer, Qiu Lifei, a local. Just as the set was about to end, Jiang arrived. In a hurry, he mistakenly thought that the person dancing with Huang was Li and splashed the acid on Qiu. As a result, Qiu's chest, back, and mouth were corroded. The dance hall staff immediately took Qiu to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police, who arrested Huang and Jiang and found a bottle of acid. They were taken to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted Huang and Jiang for inciting and causing bodily harm. The victim, Qiu Lifei, and the Da Hu Dance Hall jointly hired lawyer Wu Peng to represent them and sought compensation for damages. The case has been tried, and yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Xiong Huihua of the Second Criminal Court ordered the two defendants to appear in court. Huang Naiwu was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment for inciting bodily harm, and Jiang Ada was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment for causing bodily harm. The number of days of detention before the verdict is finalized will be counted as two days of imprisonment for each day of detention. The private civil suit will be transferred to the civil court of this court for trial.</p>

<p>Both Around Ten Years Old</p>
<p>Tragedy Caused by Going Out with Neighbor's Children</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, two boys, around ten years old, went to bathe in the cold water of a small river next to the French Army Drill Ground (i.e., the old site of Xinkang Garden) at No. 1331 Lafayette Road in the French Concession. Due to the deep water and not knowing how to swim, they both drowned in the river. It was not until 6 PM in the evening when a French girl passed by and discovered them that she reported it to the French police station, which notified the fire brigade. People were dispatched to go and fish them out. Clothes were found on the shore, and they were given injections and other rescue measures, but it was already too late. They had already died. An investigation of the surrounding area revealed no family members, so the two bodies were transported by vehicle to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for autopsy. It was not until yesterday morning that family members went to identify the two children. They were Li Zaiming, 12 years old, and Li Zaiqin, 10 years old, brothers, sons of Li Jiren (28 years old, working at the Da Wan Bao), a Suzhou native residing at No. 13, Gaofuli, Saint Mary's Road. They went out to play with the neighbor's children, resulting in this drowning tragedy. The police station reported the incident to Inspector Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, who went to the morgue to verify that the two children had indeed drowned in the water and ordered the bodies to be handed over to the father for collection.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Finance Bureau Approves Extension of License Application Period <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>License Applicants Overcrowded, Unable to Handle All Applications</p>
<p>Tobacco and Liquor Industry Petitions for an Extension</p>
<p>Since the tax on tobacco and liquor licenses in this city was taken over by the Municipal Finance Bureau, notices were issued to all industries to apply for registration and obtain licenses in accordance with regulations starting from July 1st. After receiving the order, the tobacco and liquor industries rushed to apply. As the deadline has arrived, the number of people applying for licenses these days has been too crowded to complete the process within the time limit. It is reported that the Finance Bureau has approved the merchants' request and decided to extend the deadline for several days to show consideration. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e158">Extension Granted <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau reported that the deadline for the tobacco and liquor license tax in this city, which was previously announced, was the end of July. Those who failed to pay taxes after the deadline would be punished in accordance with regulations. The above-mentioned deadline has now expired. In recent days, many merchants in the tobacco and liquor industries have flocked to various tax collection offices to apply for licenses. Each office has received no less than several hundred applications per day. The tax collection offices are handling the license applications as they arrive, but they are somewhat overwhelmed by the sudden influx. Seeing this situation, the Finance Bureau, in order to facilitate the merchants' application for licenses, has decided to extend the deadline for several days to show magnanimity. A report in a certain newspaper yesterday that each tax collection office could only handle twenty applications a day is inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Presentation by the Tobacco Exchange Industry <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Bureau of Finance, requesting an extension of the deadline for obtaining licenses to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses. The original petition stated: "Submitting this petition is to request an extension of the deadline for registration and license acquisition. According to a letter from our association's branch in South Shanghai, over 700 businesses have stated that the Ministry of Finance has transferred the taxation of tobacco and alcohol licenses to the Municipal Bureau of Finance, which began collecting taxes on July 1st. We have also received your association's notice, based on the extended deadline set by the Bureau of Finance, to promptly apply for tax payment and license acquisition in accordance with the law. Upon receiving this, we immediately sent personnel to make payments. However, the windows of the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office are small and located beside the courtyard. Taxpayers have been extremely crowded in recent days under the scorching sun and sweltering heat, which is very difficult to endure. Moreover, the designated office hours are very short, only from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Currently, many members are traveling long distances by car, waiting for a long time, and still unable to apply for tax payment and registration. They are appealing everywhere, requesting a swift solution to avoid delays and penalties. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to forward this matter to the Bureau of Finance, asking them to consider and alleviate the situation by granting another ten-day extension for registration and license acquisition, and extending the office hours by two hours each in the morning and afternoon to show leniency and facilitate application.” This matter was duly recorded and conveyed. In response, our association believes that the statements made by the South Shanghai branch are indeed factual. Considering the Bureau's short office hours and limited staff, and the large number of members registering within the deadline, the situation is inevitably crowded. Many members may not be able to register even after waiting for a long time. Recently, members have been frequently requesting solutions to avoid delays and to secure proof of registration. With the end-of-July deadline approaching, we are compelled to truthfully petition your bureau to consider the business situation and grant an extension of the deadline for registration and license acquisition for the sake of public convenience."</p>

<p>Requesting Thorough Investigation of Wife and Family's Unjust Arrest</p>
<p>Lawyer Jin Yu, courtesy name Liren, has an office on Ningbo Road in the French Concession and resides at No. 39 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road. His wife, Mrs. Wang, and others hired rickshaws on the evening of the 27th of last month to go to the Great World amusement center to cool off due to the hot weather. While passing the entrance of the Empire Theater on Avenue Joffre, the rickshaws were stopped by Wang Changshan, an investigator from the Flower Tax Department of the French Concession Police, who suspected them of being prostitutes and took them to the police station, causing trouble. Lawyer Jin has drafted a document and sent it to the French Consul, Mr. Mei, and the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Police, lodging a protest. The document is transcribed below: "Regarding the illegal and abusive arrest and detention of respectable women by Wang Changshan, an investigator from the Flower Tax Department, obstructing their freedom, we hereby report the facts and request a thorough investigation to maintain order. On the night of the 27th of this month, my wife, Mrs. Jin Wang, and others hired rickshaws to go to the rooftop of the Great World amusement center to cool off due to the hot weather. Unexpectedly, a man dressed in black silk clothing, resembling a visitor from another province, suddenly ordered the rickshaws to stop at the corner of Avenue Joffre, in front of the Empire Theater. My wife, seeing that the man was dressed in black, with a white silk belt hanging down a foot or more, and wearing a white straw hat, suspected that he was a rogue blocking the road. Therefore, she was extremely alarmed. Subsequently, the man questioned where they were going, and they immediately replied that they were going to the Great World to cool off. Unexpectedly, the man claimed to be a police investigator and, without asking for details, forcibly ordered them to get out of the rickshaws, intending to arrest them. At that time, my wife still suspected the man's identity and asked to see his police warrant, while stating that she was my wife and showing the Great World's preferential monthly pass to prove her destination. However, the investigator refused to listen and forcibly arrested them, taking them to the Songshan Road Police Station. Later, after the police investigation confirmed that she was my wife, she was released. However, from the time of arrest to the time of release, no less than two hours had passed. According to the law, the body and actions of the people shall not be arrested or detained unless absolutely necessary. Now, my wife and family all reside in Yongyu Lane, at the intersection of Ximen Road and Beile Road, within your concession. In order to travel from south to north, they must pass through Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Pichon. If respectable women are considered prostitutes simply because they pass roads where prostitutes reside, then in the future, your concession should clearly restrict passage on roads where brothels are located, so that women within the concession will know how to avoid them. Currently, your concession has no such restrictions, and the abuse of power and illegal arrests of respectable families by police investigators have occurred repeatedly. Such disturbing actions are not what your concession wants to hear. Moreover, the investigator who arrested my wife and family that night was even more improper: (1) The corner of Avenue Joffre, in front of the Empire Theater, is a major thoroughfare for vehicles. If there is no solicitation along the way, even prostitutes should not be arbitrarily arrested. (2) After my wife repeatedly stated her identity, provided her address, and explained the situation to the investigator, why did the investigator suddenly arrest her without conducting a thorough investigation? (3) The Great World is a legitimate entertainment venue. Why are most of the respectable women arbitrarily arrested by the investigator tourists to the Great World? That night, my wife showed the investigator the Great World's preferential pass. This long pass is not for sale. How could a respectable woman obtain this monthly pass? Therefore, the investigator knew that she was a respectable woman but deliberately arrested her. (4) The investigator abused his power and arbitrarily arrested respectable women. According to the law, he has violated Article 140 and Article 316, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, obstructing freedom, etc."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry of the National Government notified Yu Binqi that the Chinese typewriter he invented, specifically the upward-moving printing pins and the horizontal spacing device for interval quantity marking lines, has been examined and approved for a five-year patent. It has been announced and no objections have been raised during the announcement period. A certificate can now be obtained. The structure of the machine is as follows: It has few parts and is made entirely of steel, making it sturdy and durable. For three or four years, the national provinces and cities, such as Sichuan and Yunnan, as well as countries such as England, America, Germany, and France, have been purchasing it, and no repairs have ever been needed. Starting this year, new Song-style copper-steel characters are used, which do not damage after thousands of uses. It can make sixteen copies at once, each clear.

<h3 id="e167">Red Pill Manufacturing Facility Uncovered on Rue de l'Amiral Bayle <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Laozha Wang Da and Er are on the run.</p>
<p>Five accomplices are punished separately.</p>
<p>Wang Da and Er specialized in manufacturing poisonous pills. They formerly set up a facility in the Chinese territory of Zhabei. Later, due to the strict opium ban in the interior, they moved their headquarters to the third floor of the Pingsheng Industrial Society at No. 241 Pinghe Lane, Rue de l'Amiral Bayle in the Public Concession at the beginning of this month, and continued manufacturing day and night. However, this place was the main office and did not sell retail. All red pills produced were wholesaled elsewhere by Wang Da and Er. Therefore, the scale was large and the output was abundant. Recently, Zhao Fuhai, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, discovered this. He secretly investigated for several days and confirmed the facts. He then reported to the First Special Court and obtained a search warrant. At twelve noon the day before yesterday, he, along with Western Detective Ke Lai, Chinese Detective Yang Peizhang, and Bao Detective Weng Peiyu, Yang Youshan, etc., secretly went to the address to arrest them. Unexpectedly, Wang Da and Er had already fled after hearing the news. Only Yao Wenxin from Changzhou (also known as Yao Panshun), his brother Yao Pansheng, Qiu Yuanxi (also known as Qiu Zhenqing), Wang Ruquan from Yangzhou, and Xie Chengtao from Nanjing, were arrested. Eighteen and a half pounds of red pills, twenty-four pounds of red pill blocks, a small package of morphine, a package of coffee essence, two packages of white powder, six cloth bags, several paper bags, an account book, and all the equipment and wooden boxes for manufacturing red pills were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. In addition to detailing the case, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted the defendants according to Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law, requesting severe punishment according to the law. When questioned, Yao Wenxin confessed that he rented the house for 20 yuan per month. The bosses were Wang Da and Er, and the five of them manufactured together, but only twice, starting on the eighth of this month. All the red pills were taken away by the bosses to sell. He earned 20 yuan per month, Yao Pansheng earned 10 yuan per month, Wang earned 25 yuan per month, Xie earned 15 yuan per month, and Qiu earned 15 yuan per month. When questioned, Wang Ruquan and the other four all admitted to helping manufacture red pills, but claimed that all wages were received from the boss by Wang Ruquan and distributed. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and sentenced Yao Wenxin to two years of imprisonment for manufacturing opium substitutes, with a fine of 1,000 yuan. Wang Ruquan was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes, with a fine of 800 yuan. Yao Pansheng, Xie Chengtao, and Qiu Yuanxi were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment, with a fine of 500 yuan each. Before the judgment is final, the number of days of detention will be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days per day, and if the fine cannot be paid, it will be commuted to imprisonment at a rate of three yuan per day. The red pills and equipment seized will be confiscated according to the list.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Young Woman Commits Suicide by Drinking Salt Water <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Cause Originates From Watching a Night Show</p>
<p>Xia Jinlou from Yancheng, a 27-year-old who sells congee and resides at No. 87 Guoqing Road, Zhabei, had a wife named Gu. Because he had an affair with Xia Shen, a 24-year-old also from Yancheng, who resides at No. 308 Manzhou Road, when they went to see a night show some time ago, Xia Jinlou discovered it and filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Local Court. In desperation, Gu secretly ingested salt water and committed suicide at about 10 PM the night before last. Later, Jinlou found out and, in addition to sending Gu to the Baolong Hospital in the concession for treatment, twisted Xia Shen to the Wuzhen Road Police Station, accusing her of saying, "My wife, Gu, went to see a night show with Shen some time ago. Unexpectedly, Shen introduced a person named Xu Xiaoliuzi to have an affair with my wife. Now I have discovered it and have already sued Xu Xiaoliuzi in the Shanghai Local Court. Unexpectedly, Shen scolded my wife for not revealing the affair, so Gu swallowed salt water and committed suicide. Although she has been sent to Baolong Hospital, I don't know if her life can be saved." Shen's confession was evasive. After Xia Jinlou requested that the case be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court, the judge verified the confession and then submitted it to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, which transferred it to the Public Security Bureau for questioning yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Incident Involving Ni Chengji's Fire <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jin Attempts to Extort Compensation by Gathering a Crowd</p>
<p>The pavilion room upstairs at the Dong Chunyang divination hall at No. 320 Zhaojiabang Road in the city was subleased to Ni Chengji, who privately set up a mahjong parlor for foreign jadeite. Due to the carelessness of the old chief steward, Da Lang, a fire broke out at 5:30 PM on the 25th of this month, causing the entire house to be burned down and spreading to the adjacent floors. The First District Second Precinct has arrested Ni Chengji and others and sent them to the bureau. After questioning, it was determined that it was an accidental fire, and the burned households were not insured, so they were released with leniency. Unexpectedly, Wang Jin (67 years old), a woman from Anhui who was burned and suffered losses, went to the second landlord, Ma Weixin, at the house at 2:10 PM yesterday afternoon to demand compensation for the burnt losses. Ma immediately replied that everyone suffered losses and was not insured, so there was no money to compensate. Unexpectedly, the woman, seeing that her demand for compensation was unsuccessful, invited several hooligans to extort from Ni as Ni was moving the parlor that day, and prevented the Ni family from moving out, led by Wang Jin. The police officer Liu Zhenhai was immediately alerted and detained Wang Jin to the First District Second Precinct for investigation. After questioning by Chief Liu, it was found that the case involved the household that was burned, who attempted to extort compensation unsuccessfully and then resorted to extortion. The case was judged to be handed over to the General Bureau for review.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Headquarters of the Red Swastika Society received a letter from the Yantai Red Swastika Society stating: "The Yantai Fushan Local Court Procuratorate's letter stated that Hong Zhang has been convicted of abducting Jiang Hongxian. The victim, Jiang Hongxian, is from Nantong, Jiangsu. Although her relatives have been contacted repeatedly, there has been no response. If she is allowed to return on her own, there is a risk of something happening on the way. For humanitarian reasons, please arrange for her to be sent back to her hometown to reunite with her family." She was entrusted to the comprador of a ship to be brought to Shanghai, requesting assistance in sending her back to her hometown. After the woman in distress arrived in Shanghai, the office inquired about her age and origin. She claimed that her name was Zhang Hongxian, from Eighteen Bay, Yudong Town, South District of Nantong, and that her widowed mother was Zhang Wang. She was immediately sent to the Women's Red Swastika Society for temporary care. A letter was immediately sent to the Nantong Red Swastika Society, requesting them to verify if such a person existed. If so, the society was asked to send someone to Shanghai to have Zhang Wang personally claim her.

<h3 id="e186">Private Life and Ideals (3) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Reply to Ms. Xiao Jingjuan and Mr. Luo Fang</p>
<p>A person's private life has a significant determining effect on their thoughts and ideals. Chinese literati have traditionally had a habit of viewing personal private life as a minor matter. This habit has spread widely and has had a great influence. Indeed! Private life, in today's lifestyle based on individualism, belongs to personal private matters and does not require others to interfere.</p>
<p>However, it determines a person's success and failure, advancement and backwardness.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiao, because years of effort have not achieved her ideal, doubts her private life and wants to make a liquidation. This is completely correct. There is a Chinese saying: "A healthy spirit belongs to a healthy body." Without a sound private life, a sound ideal will never be achieved. A person who merely holds a noble ideal is still a fantasy. You have to fight for this goal, and this ideal will truly become your own, and you can turn it into reality. This process is a continuous struggle, including your "public" and "private" life. In your year-round life, in the "public" life, you are subject to social supervision, and it is easy to be discovered if you fall. Conversely, in private life, it is not the case. This aspect of life is your personal matter, and others cannot control it. Even your closest friends can only offer a few words of advice when they discover a certain phenomenon. As for the part you hide, only you know it. Moreover, a person is always a little tolerant of their private life, always thinking that small mistakes are irrelevant. Little do they know that corruption occurs in this fragile part, and its speed of reproduction can sometimes surprise you.</p>
<p>We often see many people's personalities split. We can also see the image of dual personalities in celebrity autobiographies. Especially in an era of transformation, because social contradictions are reflected in personal life, the separation of ideals and life often occurs. Honest, courageous people, they often know their weaknesses and suffer greatly because of them. This has become a theme described in literature. We must not deny it with our eyes closed.</p>
<p>But, is this a strange thing? No! It is not surprising at all. We have briefly mentioned it in "On the Contradictions of Life." Many people die in this contradiction, many people overcome this contradiction, and many people sink. Their victories and failures are not achieved overnight. They all pass through their private lives, morning and evening, either through arduous self-examination or through invisible corrosion, and slowly reach their respective ends.</p>
<p>A person who is sinking into the life of a playboy cannot be a friend of dirty people, nor can he be a warrior to transform society. Conversely, we examine a soldier who deserts on the battlefield, his desertion must be rooted in a lack of clear understanding of the nature of the war, too much leisure in his private life, unable to endure the hardships of battle, and being burdened by his lover, children, and parents, and intoxicated by the enemy's petty gains. All this is the root of his escape. It existed before he went to the front line. As for the occurrence of the act of escape, it is only because of a little fear that his actions are changed. What do we think of a deserter? Simply expressing hatred is useless. If we take the life of a soldier as our ideal life, it is not enough to only have this ideal, and it is also superficial to only hate the behavior of deserters. We must first lower the standard of our private life to a level not far from the life of a soldier. We must study the nature of war, recognize its meaning, and also consider the importance of society and the individual family. We should constantly fight against the life that is not suitable for our "ideal", without letting go of even a single point. We should strengthen the proportion of "knowledge" and the amount of struggle in life, so that we get closer to the ideal day by day.</p>
<p>Naturally, I am not saying that the progress of a person's life is purely—</p>
<p>Depending on one's own intentions, the objective environment determines a person's behavior. But people are by no means mechanical, they can have conscious active functions. A person with ideals should strive to move towards their goals. But he must not ignore his personal private life.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also examine a person whom we do not yet know deeply from their private life, because what is told here is not concealed at all, and this is the truth. "No heap of garbage is formed without garbage." It is always extremely accidental that pure things are thrown into the trash can. Although the spiritual corruption and depravity of a person have</p>
<p>Although, private life itself is also determined by the social environment. However, in this era of transformation, when the trend of the entire society has been shown so clearly, there are still some people who are caught in a great contradiction between ideals and life. Ideals are often sacrificed due to private life, which is such a pity. Therefore, we dare to say to our readers that a person with an unsound private life is not worthy of pursuing ideals, and he can never be a pioneer for ideals or realize ideals. But this is by no means Confucius's teaching of cultivating oneself first, but a guide to practical life.</p>
<p>The same is true within the scope of reading, drawing inferences from one instance. I will not go into details. Finally, I hope that the two gentlemen, Xiao and Luo, will write to us about their thoughts after reading this reply.</p>

<p>Hubei Provincial Education College is the highest institution of learning in Hubei Province. Since Mr. Luo Tingguang became the president of the college, he has actively reorganized it, and the results have been remarkable. Mr. Luo was recently ordered by the provincial government and the education department to go to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Education regarding the implementation of the new plan next year. A reporter specially visited the Central Hotel to inquire. According to him,</p>
<p>Implementing education to recover bandit areas, establishing cooperatives, promoting agricultural education, and establishing rural improvement experimental zones are all based on agriculture as the foundation and education as the method, with the aim of effectively increasing rural production and developing the rural economy. Furthermore, in order to cultivate practical agricultural improvement talents, a junior agricultural school will be attached from the next term, enrolling graduates from higher primary schools with a two-year study period. Mr. Luo will return to Hubei within a few days after finishing official business to preside over enrollment and other matters.</p>

<p>Designs Completed, Public Works Bureau Begins Tendering</p>
<p>Literary and Art Hall and Auditorium Also in Preparation</p>
<p>The construction work in Shanghai's cultural district has been actively underway since the issuance of municipal government bonds. The sports ground has already started construction, and the libraries and museums have also begun tendering for construction by the Municipal Public Works Bureau yesterday. It is expected to be completed by the fall of next year. In addition, other cultural construction projects such as the planned public auditorium, literary and art hall, and pagoda are also being prepared separately. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency specially inquired with the relevant authorities yesterday and obtained the following details:</p>
<h3 id="e212">Completing the Great Shanghai Cultural District <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>According to the provisions of the New Shanghai Plan, the intersection of Sanmin Road and Wuquan Road behind the Municipal Government Building will be designated as the cultural district. The design of the cultural district is cross-shaped. The buildings planned to be built in the cultural district include an auditorium with a capacity of 3,000 people, a library, a museum, a literary and art hall, a court, and an additional 1,000 mu of vacant land reserved for the construction of monuments and other objects. Another 120 mu has been designated in the open space for public gatherings and reviews, as well as other public or semi-public buildings, arranged in a scattered manner. The two sides of the river in the cultural district are being built into a large sports ground and park. The entire project of the above-mentioned cultural district is planned to be completed in the third and fourth phases of the project.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Libraries and Museums to be Built Ahead of Schedule <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the sports ground already under construction and the park completed, the Municipal Council decided to build the two major buildings, the library and the museum, ahead of schedule in the second phase of the project, considering the needs of the situation. The establishment of these two museums has a great impact on the education of citizens. Therefore, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has started tendering yesterday. The total cost of each is approximately 300,000 yuan, which will be fully allocated by the Finance Bureau under the municipal government bonds issued this time. All drawings and designs have been reviewed and modified many times. The construction site has been designated behind the Municipal Government Building, and the style is purely ancient palace style.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Municipal Public Works Bureau Announces Tendering <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau specially announced the tendering for the construction of library and museum projects yesterday. The original text is as follows: "The construction of the Municipal Museum Library project requires inviting merchants to bid for the contract. Any construction factory or construction company that has registered with the Bureau in accordance with the Municipal Construction Factory Registration Regulations and has contracted for projects worth more than 300,000 yuan and has rich experience can go to the Bureau in the city center from now until August 10 to collect the project experience survey form, fill in detailed experience, and submit various supporting documents for review before being notified to collect drawings and bid. Those who are not qualified will have their submitted experience and supporting documents returned."</p>
<h3 id="e215">Preparing to Collect Books and Antiques <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the start of the construction of the library and museum buildings, a large number of books and artifacts required inside the two museums still need to be collected over a long period of time. At the same time, in order to enrich and improve the quality and practicality, detailed planning is also required. Therefore, the municipal government plans to immediately organize a book and artifact collection committee to be responsible for handling the matter, so as to formulate rules and regulations separately, solicit them from all prominent aspects, and the municipal government will separately designate regular expenses for continuous purchases. According to another source, the library part is said to be planning to cooperate with the Oriental Library. Since the Oriental Library was destroyed in the "January 28" battle, it has been actively carrying out its restoration, but the location has not yet been determined. Therefore, if it can be realized, it would be a good thing. However, there are still some difficulties in merging in fact. Whether it can be implemented depends on the future facts. As for the museum part, there are also plans to temporarily borrow a part of the Shanghai-stored artifacts from the Forbidden City in Beijing to display in the museum for all circles to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Book and Magazine Review Committee Reviews Serial Picture Book Manuscripts <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The manuscripts of serial picture books compiled by various bookstores in the city were originally reviewed by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau from January of this year. Now that the Book and Magazine Review Committee of the Central Propaganda Committee has been formally established, the Municipal Education Bureau specially notified various bookstores yesterday that the manuscripts should be sent to the Committee for review starting from August 1. After the review and approval, they can be published. The matters of supervision, management, guidance, and improvement are still the responsibility of the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Social Education Society Plans to Establish a Popular Library <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Social Education Society was organized and established by the staff of social education agencies and groups in the city, it has been sparing no effort in carrying out social education work. Considering that the ordinary people in the city lack opportunities to read, it has specially planned to establish a popular library in the Municipal Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road. It is currently being actively arranged and can be established within a month.</p>

<p>Since Du Yuesheng became the chairman of the Pudong Middle School board of directors, he has held the lofty ambition of promoting and developing Pudong Middle School, which has a 30-year history, and is seeking active development in both spiritual and material aspects. He has repeatedly discussed development steps with Principal Lin Zhongke and directors Zhang Jiguang and Zhang Xiaoliang. In terms of teaching, he hired experienced and knowledgeable teachers with high prestige, such as Wang Jimei, Wu Yuefang, Lu Zulong, Huang Qixiang, Xia Chengfa, Zhang Tiemin, Wei Lizhou, and Wang Jingzhi, to teach various subjects, so that students' studies could be guided properly and progress quickly. In terms of equipment, it is divided into two steps. First, Du and Zhang will be responsible for repairing the school buildings. Except for the original auditorium and library, which do not need to be repaired due to their good materials, the student dormitories in the west, north, south, and old north sections, the ordinary classrooms in the east section, the physics laboratory, the chemistry laboratory, the physics and biology instrument room, the chemistry instrument laboratory, the chemistry instrument and medicine room, the drawing room, and the offices, labor rooms, storage rooms, entertainment rooms, military training department, Boy Scouts, League headquarters, dining hall, faculty dormitory, memorial hall, bathroom, school infirmary, swimming pool, water tower, telephone room, etc., are all being renovated extensively. Yesterday, director Zhang Jiguang invited Wang Xinxingshunji Construction Factory to contract for the project, which started construction today. The principal of the school is actively implementing the facilities. Although it is summer vacation, he is still supervising the staff in all departments at the school every day from morning to night, stepping up work without rest. The vigorous atmosphere is pervading the office. It is reported that students from various provinces are sending letters to the school requesting prospectuses due to the school's well-organized management. There are dozens of letters every day, and those who go to register are extremely crowded. The area around Liuliqiao is like the Shanyin Road, with an endless stream of people.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center, in order to facilitate the public in the southern part of Shanghai to enjoy the cool in the summer night, has extended the opening hours of Kangle Garden to 10 pm. The number of people going to the park to enjoy the cool is very crowded, with an average of more than 2,000 people every night. The garden is elegantly decorated and brightly lit, and it is indeed the only summer resort in southern Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Wusong Summer School specially rang the bell in the middle of the night in order to train students' alertness, gathering all boarding students on the sports ground. Then, five people who were still fast asleep (i.e., not alert) were inspected. Immediately, the team was sent to the Sanjiaoshui Battery in Baodao to watch the sunrise. The vocational teachers Xu Zhengji, Ma Zhaokui, Yan Yude, and Cai Zhenhuan led the team. Along the way, Tao Yishan, a military instructor for merchant ships, pressed the formation. The spirit was very solemn. It is reported that the school will soon hold a garden party to provide spiritual refreshment. The school is organized by the Shanghai Eighth District Education Association. This year is the second session. There are 200 students and more than 20 teachers. Their spirit on weekdays is very full and active.</p>

<p>He Yuanliang, president of Kunming Provincial Yunnan University, Professor Ni Zhongfang, Zhou Liqi, principal of the high school, and Li Peiqun, principal of the provincial agricultural school, and five other people, recently arrived in Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong after being ordered by the provincial government and the Department of Education to inspect agricultural education. Yesterday, they visited the Agricultural Association, the Industrial Association, the Rural Education Department of Lida, the Yutang Cooperative, and the Huangdu Rural Teachers School to learn from them. Cultural institutions in the local area specially held banquets to welcome them. Yesterday it was Mr. Hu Shenming, today it is the China Book Company, and tomorrow afternoon it is the Commercial Press, and famous principals and educators were invited to accompany them. The reporter met Mr. He at the hotel yesterday and asked about the implementation of border education. According to him, the Provincial Department of Education plans to establish more than 30 border schools in the near future to cultivate teachers on the one hand and promote culture on the other. It has also decided to first start with investigating races and dialects and implement the steps. The funds, in addition to a portion allocated by the Ministry of Education from the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Funds, will be fully funded by the Department of Education, which will be responsible for raising funds to ensure that the people in the border areas are not assimilated by foreign tribes.</p>

<p>In order to train talents to serve the border areas, the city's gentry and the children of the Panchen Lama specially planned to establish the Mongolian and Tibetan College, which has already started enrollment and is scheduled to start school next semester. Regarding the matter of registration, the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department of the Ministry of Education sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the school's facilities. It is reported that the investigation results show that the school's facilities are still qualified and should be approved for registration. However, the name is not appropriate. The two characters "College" seem to be too large in scale. It has now been decided to change the name to "Private Shanghai Mongolian and Tibetan School," which has been approved, and an order will be issued immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e223">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, the large sedan chairs carrying Guangxu and Longyu together occupied a spacious carriage. Yet, not a single eunuch dared to boldly climb up and take advantage of the empty space! The Empress Dowager's imperial carriage was even more extravagant. It was covered by a massive piece of yellow cloth, occupying an entire carriage alone. The remaining space was sufficient for sixty or seventy people to reside in, but who would dare to utilize it? Judging from this situation, being a eunuch in the palace was sometimes not even on par with dogs or horses, and even less than a piece of furniture!</p>
<p>I really couldn't describe the conditions in the row of military vehicles behind us, because I could only see them from afar each time, and never had the opportunity to examine them closely.</p>
<p>In summary, the Empress Dowager's carriage was undoubtedly the most interesting among all these vehicles. At that time, it represented the entire Qing Palace, and the person riding inside was the sole central figure in the Qing Palace, and therefore the central figure of the entire Manchu Empire.</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Small Court on the Train</p>
<p>The front part of the Empress Dowager's carriage was partitioned into a small boudoir. Although the space was very limited, the style and all the furnishings were created with much thought and effort. Therefore, it was not only beautiful and luxurious, but also in its outline and structure, very similar to the inner chambers of the palace. It was truly a miniature inner palace. However, this only refers to its quality and form. As for the size of the space and the quantity of furniture, the difference was naturally too great - because in this small boudoir, apart from a large bed - the bed was made of redwood, and the Empress Dowager's carriage itself was made of the best teak wood, painted so brightly that it was worthy of her redwood bed - there was not much other furniture that could be considered large pieces. Old-fashioned Chinese beds usually have a frame for hanging mosquito nets, and the Empress Dowager's bed certainly could not be without one. (95)</p>

<p>The aristocratic class truly has many ingenious methods of enjoyment. Just talking about sleep, with spring-cushioned mattresses and wild duck down quilts, it truly fits the humorous interlude in the "Three Smiles" narrative, where Lady Zhou, sleeping in the silk quilt of Wang Laohu's sister, Xiuying, felt as if her body was sliding into a pond. I saw Yuan Yangyu's "New Talks on Mountain Living" saying:</p>
<p>"When I was a child, I heard my late father, the Privy Councillor, say that he once saw in the Song Dynasty palace treasury a brocade quilt of Meng Shu's King. It was wide, the warp thread passed through, the head of the quilt was made into two holes, woven into the shape of cloud plates, covering and buttoning under the neck, like a round collar, with the remaining brocade on both sides, covering the shoulders. This is called a 'Mandarin Duck Quilt.'"</p>
<p>I also had such an ideal, because children often kick off the covers when they sleep alone in bed, especially in spring and autumn when the weather is cool but not cold, making it easier to kick off the covers and catch a chill, which leads to illness. I wanted to specially make a kind of quilt head for them, tied with straps. But I felt it was too troublesome, too restrictive, and inconvenient for getting up quickly. If Meng Chang's Mandarin Duck Quilt was modified a little, it could be made into a most suitable utensil for children.</p>
<p>Originally, a quilt has the meaning of wrapping the body, so wealthy people in Suzhou wear quilts when they die, similar to the meaning of a newborn child being wrapped in swaddling clothes. The same word "quilt" is placed with the word "mandarin duck," and the realm is greatly different. However, the Shu ruler and Lady Huarui did not enjoy it for many years before they were separated, and only obtained the lonely quilt alone. Lady Huarui's warm quilt was taken by others. Mandarin duck dreams are not lasting, and brocade quilts are empty, which is truly excellent material for palace poetry.</p>

<p>Next to the river harbor stood several embraceable weeping willows. Under the swaying willow branches was a thatched pavilion-like structure, which was the ox-cart shed. In the rural areas of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, wherever rice is grown, this type of ox-cart shed is built almost every five steps, every ten steps, continuously. Not only can the old ox drawing water find shade in the shed, but also travelers walking can rest their feet in the shed if they feel hot; if they encounter rain on the road, they can also take shelter in the shed. Its function is truly almost the same as the "ten-mile long pavilions" of ancient times.</p>
<p>The structure of the shed is very simple, with four crude pillars, and the top covered with a sedge hat-style straw roof. A strong wooden pillar is supported in the shed, passing through a large wooden wheel; the teeth of the wheel are tied to a well sweep; turning the wheel, the well sweep goes up and down; the water in the river harbor then comes up, and is pumped into the fields. The strong and hardy old ox, wearing a blindfold, with a horizontal wood on its back on the wheel, turns and turns, and the water gurgles up. If the ox wants to be lazy and stop, the whip behind it is fiercely lashed. Only when it is exhausted, panting and drooping its tongue, can it see the mature ears of rice in the field, and the corners of the threshing ground full of grain, providing the people in the city with a peaceful life of eating and drinking.</p>
<p>The neat and green rice fields; surrounded by winding river harbors; dotted with sparsely scattered ox-cart sheds, truly rich in painting and poetic meaning. I truly love to watch, and truly love to wander there, and I still constantly miss this beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>But now it is a world of machinery, and the old-fashioned countryside is also following the trend to use water pumps, and the sound of the motor rumbling can be heard in all directions, and the picturesque ox-cart sheds are rarely seen! Some villagers have already slaughtered their plowing oxen, and are no longer happy to plant the fields, so the ox-cart sheds are also eliminated accordingly!</p>

<p>Mr. Lu went to the park for a stroll and met Ms. Shi. At first, you glanced at me, and I glanced at you. After five minutes, Ms. Shi smiled slightly and swayed her waist as she walked away. Mr. Lu hurried to follow behind. Ms. Shi turned left and right, and Mr. Lu also followed her left and right. Passing by a movie theater, Mr. Lu tentatively said, "Shall we watch a movie?" Ms. Shi turned her head and smiled, stepping up first. Mr. Lu dared not delay, and hurried to buy two tickets, finding seats in the last row. The lights went out, the movie began, and Mr. Lu and Ms. Shi began to ask each other's names, ages, hometowns, education, occupations, and addresses. After the movie was over, they went to a Western restaurant for dinner together. After dinner, Mr. Lu sent Ms. Shi home.</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Lu wrote a love letter in a scarlet envelope to Ms. Shi, inviting her to meet him at a certain movie theater at nine o'clock the next evening. The next day, Mr. Lu arrived half an hour early, but hurried there and waited for a quarter of an hour. Ms. Shi also came. When the two met, they did not go to see a movie, but went to a snack shop to eat snacks and chat. After eating snacks, Ms. Shi stood up to go home. Mr. Lu said, "There's still time, let's go to a hotel to talk for a while." The elevator of a large hotel carried the pair up to the fifth floor. The waiter led them into a small room, and then there was no more to be said for the night.</p>
<p>Three days later, Mr. Lu and Ms. Shi got married with a simple ceremony. Three days after that, Ms. Shi discovered that Mr. Lu was already a married man, and Mr. Lu also complained that Ms. Shi had too many boyfriends, and both parties agreed to divorce.</p>
<p>This is a modern model marriage.</p>

<p>Zhao Weng wiped his eyes twice with a towel, stood up, and comforted him in a very gentle tone: "Don't rush. The newspaper only said that the place was lost and the battalion commander was killed in battle. As for what happened to the four company commanders, we don't know yet. I think that Ziqiang is so loyal and honest, he won't end up in a bad situation." Saying this, his voice choked up again. Guizhi tried hard to hold back her tears, wiped her eyes a few times, and then said to him: "Dad, how do you know about this? Did you specifically buy the newspaper to see?" Weng said: "How would I know? Isn't there a small newspaper subscribed to in the front counter? Today they were discussing it a lot. When they saw me go, they immediately put the newspaper away and didn't mention a word. I saw that their expressions were wrong, and knew that it had something to do with us, so I insisted on getting the newspaper from them to read. I think about it carefully, and things are a bit bad." Saying this, the old man's nose twitched and he cried again. Guizhi handed the newspaper to him, saying: "Take a closer look, I don't recognize the words on it very well." Hearing this, Zhao Weng took the large and small newspapers in his hands again and looked at them one by one. "Aren't they all the same, saying that the national army was defeated and the entire army was annihilated?" Thinking in his heart that the fewer people who knew about this, the fewer people would suffer, and the later they knew, the later they would suffer, so he wouldn't explain it to Guizhi's mother and daughter, which would save himself a lot of trouble in comforting them. So he said to Guizhi: "Based on the newspaper alone, it's also unreliable. Let me go and inquire carefully." Before he finished speaking, Jiang already interjected outside the door, saying: "I've been listening outside for a long time, what should we do about this?" Saying this, he also cried as he came in. Zhao Weng said, "Now we can only find out the news clearly and then think of other solutions. Before we get definite news, we are wasting our efforts by worrying." (446)</p>
<p>Where Travels Lead</p>

<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>Yangzhou has been known as a scenic spot since ancient times. In history, geography, and poetry, there are specialized records about it, so Yangzhou is indeed a special place. The ancient Yangzhou, and the Yangzhou of Emperor Yang of Sui, lasted for a long time, so let's not mention them for now. Let's just say that the Yangzhou of the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, which is relatively recent, can be verified in everything; everything is as if it were in front of us. The reason why Yangzhou is able to have a special meaning, and is able to be valued, the biggest reason is nothing more than due to the magnificent buildings and beautiful scenery, this is undoubtedly true. In modern times, someone once suggested that Yangzhou also be included in the scenic area. I remember that the ancient poem said: "In the spring breeze of ten li in Yangzhou road, rolling up the beaded curtains is not as good." It also said: "The spring breeze cuts palace brocade throughout the country, half makes horsecloths and half makes sails." Based on these four fragmented sentences alone, it is enough to represent the beauty and greatness of Yangzhou's scenery!</p>
<p>During the Qianlong dynasty of the Qing Dynasty, the emperor was happy for a while and went to Jiangnan twice. At that time, it was an autocratic regime, it was the world of the Aisin Gioro clan, the people were oppressed under the tyranny of the autocrat, and everything had to be centered on the emperor. However, the scenery of Yangzhou was established, and the famous sites were created and left behind, most of which were due to Qianlong, the so-called "ten li of smoky flowers, nine bends of the abyss;" the so-called "ten li of Sui embankment, the grass is like brocade, one willow tree and one peach tree", all because the people of Yangzhou wanted to flatter Qianlong, and it became the artificial beauty of the smoke and rain pavilions. Unexpectedly, an autocratic emperor who wasted people and money became an expert in setting up scenic areas, and opened the way for future generations of architecture, which is so interesting.</p>
<p>Outside the north gate of Yangzhou, among the small Jinshan Five Pavilion Bridge, there is a temple called "Fahai Temple". Its predecessor was originally called "Lianxing Temple." In the architecture of the Buddhist sect, most of them are full of feudal ideas, which is not surprising. "Fahai Temple" certainly cannot jump out of this range. However, a small temple like Fahai is now even more desolate and dilapidated everywhere, with a thousand kinds of desolation in sight. If the Buddha fruit has a soul, I am afraid it would also be unbearable to look back? Legend has it that when Qianlong visited Yangzhou that year, one day he boated on the Shouxihu Lake, just as "the evening sun and Xiao drums sent several boats home". He happened to turn his head and looked at Fahai Temple in the distance, and suddenly uttered a word inadvertently, saying: "Such a lake, it is a pity that there is one less pagoda. If there is a pagoda, and a cone (that is, a Lama pagoda) is built next to Fahai Temple, then it would be a perfect embellishment."</p>
<p>At that time, the so-called "escort attendants" surrounding Qianlong, in addition to a group of ministers and ministers, there was also a group of local salt merchants who were oppressed on the outside but inwardly flattered. Being fortunate enough to accompany the emperor's chariot was truly glorious for their families and honorable for their ancestors, and there was an unspeakable joy between glances! Having heard the "golden words of the emperor"? They thought he had moved the "莼罏之思". So they immediately quietly started work overnight, combining the blood, sweat, and energy of thousands of sacred laborers, and after a night's work, tomorrow, next to Fahai Temple, there will indeed be an extra pagoda. When Qianlong went to visit the lake again, he had already seen this large radish-style cone next to the temple. He just laughed it off, asking why it was built so quickly? Those salt merchants shouted "Long live" three times, and replied in unison: "The Holy Emperor is protected by a hundred spirits", but they had long forgotten how many blood, sweat, and energy had been sacrificed last night, and even cost the lives of some people.</p>
<p>Now things have changed, the people who built the tower and the people who watched the tower have both turned to dust, leaving only this hastily built tower, just for later generations to mourn!</p>

<p>The Financial Gold Price Retreats Below Ninety Yuan</p>
<p>A Further Drop of Two Yuan and Two Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market continued its downward trend yesterday, and with confidence flagging, it finally retreated below ninety yuan. However, with limited trading, the market was quiet. Initially in the morning, overseas silver markets saw gains, with England up and America steady. The forward silver price on the metal exchange rose between one and two li. London raw gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates were stable. American cotton rose twenty points and American wheat rose 1.25 cents. Confidence stabilized. Initial outside preparations opened very flat, between ninety-one and ninety-two yuan. The opening was slightly lower due to the loosening of exchange rates. Although there was little fluctuation after the opening, the banks diligently and vigorously pushed downwards, coupled with the announcement of the HSBC exchange rate, with England flat and America suddenly rising 1.125, it approached the ninety yuan mark. At this point, there were quite a few people placing limit orders. Banks also slightly bought far-term US exchange, and the gold price was still able to maintain. However, with frequent intentions to sell from major clients and speculators selling off, it finally broke the ninety yuan mark. However, the selling wind saw low prices and stopped, and the downward momentum was extremely weak. The gold market became stagnant again. After that, the banks' appetite shifted, buying far and selling near, and the process was stable. Demand in the market lacked strength, and it hovered around ninety yuan. It stabilized slightly at noon. The afternoon market opened flat. Later, due to Sassoon selling shillings again and the exchange rate loosening, Mumbai telegraphed "no change" and a rise of one anna, and it retreated below ninety yuan. According to a telegram from Xinfeng Foreign Firm, the future of the French franc is still difficult to stabilize, and the talk of firm silver prices in Europe made the gold market even more tired. However, there were still eager buyers taking advantage of the low price. It was rumored that the Central Bank was open for spot transactions, and buyers in the market suddenly became strong. Banks slightly bought on the cheap. Mumbai retraced one anna, then rose again above ninety yuan, but the close was still below ninety yuan. The market was calm throughout the day, with extremely narrow fluctuations, and the underlying trend was downward. The price of pure gold was added at eleven yuan, Tianjin goods were added at thirteen yuan, and East goods were added at slightly less than twelve yuan. Four thousand taels arrived at the port, and the swap spread retreated further to within five jiao. The market conditions for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 91.5 yuan, down five jiao from the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. Exchange rates opened with recent selling prices, with the English exchange at one shilling and four pence and 0.125. The US exchange was 33.8125 yuan. HSBC, Shanghai, and Citibank sold US dollars for August at 8125. Mitsui came out with 9375 for September. The market was unsustainable. Gan Changxiang, Hengyu, Shenkang, Dingtai, Fuxingyong, Futaiheng, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and others jointly sold off. In addition, knowing in advance that the HSBC exchange rate would be announced, with England flat and America rising 1.125, it retreated to 0.05 jiao. Shunmao wanted to buy, and it slightly rebounded. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Yiyu sold again, and it fell to ninety yuan. Shunmao, Yuanshengyong, and Hengyu bought. Pangen bought US dollars for November at 1875, and it rose to ninety-one yuan. However, the banks still vigorously sold. Shanghai and Huabi sold US dollars for October at 0625. Under the strong supply from Fuchang, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and Hengxingyuan, it broke the ninety yuan mark and fell to 89.4 yuan. Zhengchang, Yifengyong, and Yuanyi bought and stabilized. Zhentai and Shunli also bought, and it rose back to 90.3 yuan. The banks' appetite shifted to buying near and selling far, and Yongli's disposal pushed it down to 89.6 yuan. After this, it hovered around ninety yuan for quite a while with no special changes. Maijiaji ate US dollars for December at 3125, and the underlying trend was still stable. After Dadayong and Yuanyi slightly bought, it rose to 90.4 yuan. After hovering, the noon close was 90.3 yuan, and goods were auctioned at ninety yuan, so after the close, it retreated below ninety yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 90.1 yuan, and goods opened at the same price, then rose to three jiao. Sassoon came to sell shillings for August at 125. Mitsui sold US dollars for October at 0625. Chengkang, Qianchangxiang, Changshengyong, Dacheng, Yuqingyong, Fuan, and Yuanchun sold, and gradually declined. Mumbai telegraphed "no change" and a rise of one anna.

Yifengyong and Hengtai bought and flattened, Yuanmaoyong and Hengxingyuan also bought and rose to nine yuan and two jiao. Hengyu sold, retreating to eight yuan and eight jiao. It was rumored that the Central Bank was open for spot transactions, and under the vigorous purchases from Chunyuanyong and Yuqingyong in the market, it rallied. Mumbai retraced a small one anna. Citibank ate US dollars for October at 125. Yuqingyong, Dadayong, Feiyu, and Yongde all bought, and it rose to 90.3 yuan. Dachangxiang and others disposed of it and it went downstream.

Checking the highest price for the day was 91.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 88.4 yuan, a fluctuation of 3.1 yuan. As a result, it fell further by 2.2 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>

<h3 id="e232">New Soybeans From Changzhou Have Arrived in P] <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of new soybeans, Changzhou Cowhide Yellow, arrived in Erzhuang, totaling 111 packages. Due to drought, the quality was inferior. It is said that this year's harvest is only 30-40%. Yesterday, 61 packages were opened, priced at 3 yuan and 25 cents, managed by this street. The remaining 50 packages were unopened due to inferior quality. The market for new soybeans in the city gate and new Fenqing Jiangqiao soybeans was stable. The market for old soybeans was slightly sluggish due to reduced factory sales, so people's sentiment was somewhat soft. A total of 11-12 vehicles of various soybeans were traded, both openly and secretly.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>The factory's refined white sugar dropped by 10 cents.</p>
<p>More than 500 packages of Hainan red sugar were opened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market opened with a price decrease, closing at 1.995, leading to a softening trend. The public association did not make a deal on the rough sand white spot price. The price for delivery at the dock was 20 yuan and 5 cents. There was a shortage of Dutch red sugar due to tight spot transactions. Although some had arrived in previous days, they were not yet available. The price for the 9th was 15 yuan and 50 cents. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20 yuan and 45 cents, with a shortage of goods. Zhenyu No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory was 18 yuan and 90 cents, No. 2 was 70 cents, No. 3 was 30 cents, and No. 4 was 17 yuan and 90 cents. More than 300 packages of Chaoqing Huangyangqing were opened, with high-quality sugar at 13 yuan and 50 cents and ordinary sugar at 13 yuan and 30 cents. Hainan red sugar sales were active, with more than 500 packages opened yesterday, priced from 13 yuan and 10 cents to 12 yuan and 85 cents.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<p>The New Glutinous Rice Branch Market Seems Loose</p>
<p>The first batch of glutinous rice branches arrived in small quantities, once priced at 150 yuan. More was opened yesterday, but by 6 pm, the North Market had not finished opening due to the simultaneous opening of Jinshan branches, which took more time. There is a possibility that the market will loosen. This year's production is still abundant, so the price is likely to be unstable. The price of newly opened Jinshan Yuan branches was similar to before, with no major fluctuations. Although the first batch of Lanzhu branches opened at 40 yuan, the second batch was small in quantity and the quality was impure, so the opening prices differed by 6-7 yuan. Good-quality grains were pure and large, with less degradation. The third batch was imported by ship from Guangdong, with only 57 pieces arriving, but the market is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>Green Tea Sales Vary</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, Zhejiang Pingshui Wuse Dabang green tea sales were once again active. The entire market, including Jinlong, Jardine Matheson, and Huacha, purchased more than 9,800 boxes of goods from Huzhou, Ningbo, and other areas. Transactions were unusually brisk, with selling prices ranging from 48 yuan and 50 cents to 52 yuan and 75 cents, unchanged from before. However, the market for green teas from Luzhuang, Tuzhuang, and other areas remained sluggish. Goods from Wuyuan, Kaihua, Yushan, and other areas were the most sluggish. Goods from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian were also seeing a gradual decrease in market prices due to weak sales, creating an unfavorable situation.</p>

<p>Free Talk - Long Live the Public Language Wu Zhihui</p>
<p>—A Letter in Response to Cao Juren's Discussion on the Public Language Problem—</p>
<p>Mr. Cao: It has been a long time since I have had the pleasure of learning from you. However, I often read your works in many publications, and I have benefited a lot.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and the public language, I also wanted to join in the excitement and add a few words. However, in recent years, I have been studying the seventeen histories. Where should I start? Ni Yunlin said, "Speaking is vulgar," because he was afraid of becoming vulgar himself and did not want to speak. I know that I cannot produce ivory from my mouth and that everything I say will be vulgar, so I dare not speak. Therefore, even when faced with such a lively issue, I still dared not say anything. Thank you for mentioning my science and engineering issues in relation to this question. I have not yet fulfilled your kindness by saying a few words. It is because I learned from you in the past that I hope others will engage in science and engineering, but I myself am neither scientific nor engineering. This is truly to the point. Since then, I have found it annoying to be constantly poked, and I have had nothing to say. Now that you have asked me about the issue of classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and the public language, I will write down what I want to say in my heart for you to laugh at.</p>
<p>To sum up, I will first say one sentence: it is indeed difficult for classical Chinese to die out completely in a short period of time. But to say that it will revive and replace vernacular Chinese is a joke. And it is as certain as the iron tree cannot bloom. Mr. Wang, Mr. Liu, and others suddenly advocated that middle schools should focus on classical Chinese after junior high school, with seven parts of intention to save people, and perhaps three parts of intention to defend the way. Because they saw that the examination papers and the graduates were really bad at classical Chinese and not suitable for the official style, which made it difficult for them to find a job. They wanted to save these "job-finding gentlemen," so they hoped that the schools would open the door of convenience and give them the tools to find a job. This seven parts is compassion. I think Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu are unbiased and are sacrificing for others, not protecting themselves. As for the three parts of defending the way, it is a matter of opinion. They occasionally feel that classical Chinese can help preserve the way they hope for a little more. Just as vernacular Chinese or public language advocates also believe that they can be superstitious about the relationship between the body of writing and the way. Moreover, with only three parts, Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu can also be forgiven.</p>
<p>However, I do not believe that the style of writing is related to defending the way. If there is a way in classical Chinese, why did the Three Principles of the People of the Premier write in vernacular Chinese? If vernacular Chinese is entirely the way, why do vernacular Chinese writers often hear criticism of certain schools and certain novels? It can be seen that classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and the public language are only tools. There is only a difference between being easy to popularize and not easy to popularize. In our current situation, if we rationally allocate, that is, in terms of schools, only 50% can enter the officialdom, 15% can teach in schools, and 80% are expected to write about agriculture, industry, and commerce. In middle school, all 100% should focus on their science, chemistry, mathematics, and should also learn science and engineering, and must also learn foreign languages. Then, it is enough for them to be able to read Premier's Three Principles of the People in easy vernacular Chinese. In high school, the 20% who are divided out should also learn some classical Chinese that is suitable for the official style. In colleges and universities, they should then go to study law, politics, literature, and philosophy according to their interests. The number is also sufficient for the Examination Yuan to select and the government agencies to employ. I am still afraid that there are too few roads and too many people who want to go out. Why must we focus on the official style in junior high school and imply where the way out is, but in fact, this road does not work, and the society is left with a large number of middle-level hooligans? Therefore, Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu are trying to save people, but they are actually harming people. Mr. Wang has never entered the animal realm, but Mr. Liu is like me, who has entered the animal realm. Looking back, which child was not forced to read the Four Books and Five Classics? Of course, no one dared to question classical Chinese. However, how many of the one or two dozen scholars selected in each county were fluent? Mr. Zhuang Sijian often said: "The articles in the examination are for seeing officials, not for seeing friends." Compared with the current middle school students, the minority are no less than the children of the past. Those who are outstanding, such as Mr. Liu, were also the smallest minority at that time. Therefore, it is not that only classical Chinese can produce talents! In the end, classical Chinese can become literature, vernacular Chinese can also become literature, and the public language will certainly become literature. However, classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and the public language have different levels of ease of popularization. Of course, vernacular Chinese is easier to popularize than classical Chinese, and the public language must be easier to popularize than vernacular Chinese. If it comes to literature, I am afraid that classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and the public language are all only for the minority. In fact, even the official style and the like only require classical Chinese, but not classical Chinese literature. Even those who write vernacular Chinese well may not be able to write that official-style classical Chinese. It is a pity that as soon as they write classical Chinese, they immediately hope that they will understand literature. Therefore, the incoherence of classical Chinese arises from this.</p>
<p>In this war between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese, there are many admirable works. I have paid attention to two articles. One is Mr. You Mojun's "Talking about the Public Language from the Perspective of Middle School Students' Writing." He cited the Zhejiang joint entrance examination, with the title "The Friend I Admire Most." One of them is in classical Chinese, saying, "Since ancient times, heroes and great men..." which does have a hint of Guwen Guanzhi. But Mr. You wants to ask what use it is in daily life? I replied: "Only call it literature. I am afraid that if you ask this gentleman to handle official documents, he may not be able to be very clear." Therefore, do not only blame classical Chinese. In this joint entrance examination, Mr. You also cited a vernacular Chinese piece, saying, "The friendship of ancient gentlemen is as light as water..." Mr. You also criticized it as indigestible vernacular Chinese. However, the reason for digestion or indigestion is also because it is being done as literature. Everyone now wants to build a public language and overthrow vernacular Chinese. I am afraid that it is vernacular Chinese literature that has caused the trouble. Therefore, Mr. Hu Shi resists classical Chinese and tells people to work hard in vernacular Chinese literature. I do not know that on the other hand, vernacular Chinese literature is not competitive. Only a few can do it well, just like classical Chinese literature, which is ultimately for the minority. Unconsciously, people also vernacular Chinese literature, ghosts also vernacular Chinese literature, just like Guwen Guanzhi often collapsed on the stage of classical Chinese. And the public language unceremoniously came to denounce and punish it. Because in terms of tools, vernacular Chinese is naturally superior to classical Chinese because it is easy to popularize. However, once it comes to literature, it is smoky and chaotic. Good classical Chinese literature, such as Yuan Zhonglang's essays, is only for people in ivory towers to relieve boredom, and good vernacular Chinese literature is only for friends in the pavilion to relieve boredom. Most of the monsters are simply inexplicable to the public, just like Guwen Guanzhi. Therefore, here, I would like to contribute: Do not build a public language and then follow it with public language literature. If you can build a public language literature, of course, it is like Mr. Hu Shi who built vernacular Chinese literature into vernacular Chinese. But in the end, there will be an overthrow.</p>
<p>The other of the two articles that I paid attention to this time is Mr. Tao Zhixing's "The Road to the Public Language Movement." He said: Public language and public writing (writing is writing, not literature. Classical Chinese, classical Chinese writing, classical Chinese literature; vernacular Chinese, vernacular Chinese writing, vernacular Chinese literature: public language, public language writing, public language literature, that is, the public language will need literature in the future, let the public create it themselves, do not be like vernacular Chinese literature, which is still a few classical Chinese literati who changed their heads and faces to handle it.) must be united. United in degree, united in need, and united in consciousness. He advocates a three-pronged approach to symbols. Chinese characters must be taught, phonetic alphabets must be taught, and using phonetic alphabets to spell out the public language must be taught even more. I think his meaning is also to promote vulgar writing and simplified Chinese characters. That is, sometimes when caught off guard, adding a few homophones is also allowed by his teacher. I also allow him to combine Chinese characters, phonetic symbols, and homophones when they are not enough to use. When public education is popularized, let the able people in the public sort out a clue; when the San You in the hutong need hutong leisure products, let them create public literature; do not let today's literati and scholars turn blue in the face, set writing examples, and create vocabulary, as if the public should come to receive our decrees. Seeing homophones and phonetic symbols mixed in, they are strictly forbidden. If this is the case, it is also affected by traditional thinking, and what is the difference between the classical Chinese gentlemen who say "it existed in ancient times, it has been passed down"? Classical Chinese existed in ancient times, which is ridiculous. Vernacular Chinese gentlemen say that it exists in the West, and they must introduce it to the public as soon as they learn and practice it. This is the incurable stain that vernacular Chinese will be revolutionized by the public language. Literary genius is very rare, and Dong Shi imitates it, there is a fixed format, plus shackles. Therefore, we must be very careful about advocating literature in the public language. It is best to follow Mr. Tao's meaning and let the public create it themselves, instead of handling it on their behalf.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to my guess, Mr. Chen Wangdao and others put out this banner of public language. The public is vertical, speaking to the majority of classes. Although there is also the intention to slowly connect to the horizontal aspect, one person's speaking can make 400 million people understand together, but according to my nonsense, I am afraid that Mr. Chen's intention was not to jump to that in one leap. What 400 million people understand together is called a unified language, not the public language that is urgently needed in the first step. You have the public, and we have the public. Your public combines your language and writing. Our public combines our language and writing. Your public and our public have a unified language and writing, and then they combine with each other. A kind of unified language, which is still created by the public, is the second step. This is probably not a utopia. You and we often talk to each other now. You are not you, and we are not we. There is its own incorrect mixed official language. The mixed official language must be the unified language of the future. It may be quite appropriate to bring a little bit of Beijing dialect, but it must really meet Mr. Tao's standard of "the best to listen to and willing to learn." However, even British English and American English cannot conform to the single style of Yorkshire. A single style is the opposite of an imperial decree. The concept of a single style in our country has not only entered the political world, biting tightly on the dick, and the chicken legs cannot be pulled away, but also in the literary world, moving a hair will cause a sad feeling of losing a parent. The crime of destroying unity is the greatest crime in the political world. Is it not the same in the academic world? Well, I admire literature, and I admire both classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese literature. It is a pity that I have no strength to look at people, and I am only putting on small feet, which is really disgusting, and therefore harmful to your country and your family. Therefore, I dare to make a conclusion to answer your clear question:</p>
<p>Literature does not die, disaster does not stop.</p>
<p>Well, long live the public language! If the public language and writing are united, write some simple science and technology articles to benefit the public's rice bowl, which would be especially perfect. Otherwise, how much is knowledge worth a catty? It cannot be eaten when hungry, and it cannot be worn when cold. Instilling everyone with knowledge to cry with their heads in their arms, crying so that the public is skinny, and it will not be easy to carry out any revolution or resist the enemy! Thinking back to the previous days, you are not good, overthrow you, I will do it, you come I come, it is still the same thing. Where is the fundamental weakness? It is that you yourself are neither scientific nor engineering. I cannot help but feel ashamed of you, sir. Well, I wish you good health!</p>
<p>Your younger brother Jingheng bows on the 29th</p>
<p>Also: Yama has not endowed me with literary talent. I am a "fart fart, really unreasonable" public, and I hope you will forgive some missing words and errors. The society is really dizzy now. Mr. Liu Bannong is a great expert in phonetic literacy, but he is pulled to be counted as a literary man, which is considered respect for him. I do not know that it is scolding him, it is burying him, and it is so upside down. You must laugh at it too.</p>
<p>Gejiu Factory Li Qiao</p>
<p>—Mine Communications II—</p>
<p>"When you get to the factory, you can't be like you were at home. You have to remember: You have to endure everything - for example, for example -"</p>
<p>Before I went to the factory, the acquaintance who "walked the water" (1) told me everything about the factory and told me what I should pay attention to. He was very concerned about me and hoped that I could find a woman's money in the factory so that I could go home and marry a wife! But I never knew that life at the factory would be so bad!</p>
<p>Everyone here is busy working all day long. In the morning, before it is light, a cook with a grass rope tied around his waist and a black turban soaked in sweat on his head has already cooked the rice and is just waiting for people to eat. Rubbing his eyes, which were smoked by the firewood smoke, he shouted loudly to the people sleeping in the kitchen:</p>
<p>"Get up! Get up!..."</p>
<p>The shout was only three times, and the cook felt that he had fulfilled his obligations and stopped caring. If there were still people sleeping soundly at this time because they were too tired, the boss would walk out of the "noble room" (2) unceremoniously, pick up a bucket full of water without saying a word, and pour it down on their heads! This would startle you from your dream as if you had been struck by lightning, and you would run to the dark sky all wet.</p>
<p>Squatting on the ground around a stinky kerosene lamp, just as you hear the crisp first crow of the rooster announcing the dawn, people are eating in a mess.</p>
<p>What is there to eat besides that only bowl of "Old Mother Soup" (3) every day? But it is more precious than ginseng soup! People who wash their faces in the morning are not qualified to eat it. This high rule is called "no soup with a washed face, no face washing with soup." Because the water in this place is only relied on when it rains in May and June to dig a square mud pond and store it to survive. When it is dry, the water is sold for one or two yuan per load, and sometimes you cannot even buy it. Therefore, even a pond of unbearably dirty and smelly water, with feces and urine, will be casually stirred with a little alum and used as drinking water.</p>
<p>But as a result, plague, scabies... and other diseases breed playfully in the crowd. Death, terrible death, also comes unceremoniously!</p>
<p>But what is so great about death? In this place, the death of a person is like the death of an ant being trampled. As soon as a miner gets sick, not only is there no medicine, but the boss also mercilessly forbids him to sleep in the kitchen. Therefore, they have to sleep in the open outside the kitchen, but what kind of situation is it outside the kitchen? The strong wind blows and howls day and night, and the mournful sound of hungry wolves comes from near and far at night, making people feel very terrified. In this situation, even if they are not taken away by hungry wolves, their lives will end quickly!</p>
<p>After death, the body is thrown far away in a cave or a desolate and uninhabited valley.</p>
<p>Such death and abandonment do not receive pity or compassion in this place. The hearts of the living are only focused on work, picking and digging all day long, as if they want to shovel away these bare mountains, so busy that they cannot even catch their breath!</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you want to stretch your back and take a breath of leisure, a stern voice will be thrown into your ears:</p>
<p>"You motherfucker, if you can't do it, get out! This place is not a..."</p>
<p>Get out, can he really easily let you get out? If you cannot stand this scolding or this hard work, and you sneak away, he will send someone to look for you, saying that you have run away with something of his (or that you have run away with "monthly living money" (4)), and he will cruelly hang you up and beat you! Until you are about to die, a heavy pair of shackles will be put on your feet. From then on, you will always faithfully work for him without pay!</p>
<p>Because this is the factory rule here, the government will not care about you!</p>
<p>Such things terrified my little heart when I first went there! I, a young "next class" (5) kid, was always working with a cold sweat.</p>
<p>...I was always awkward and afraid in all my actions. My heavy heart was always thinking of my parents who were far away!</p>
<p>On the fifth day after I arrived at the factory, the "walking water" acquaintance was leaving me to go home. I looked at him with attachment, as if I would be eaten by the boss as soon as I left him. I almost wanted to cry as I looked at him!</p>

<p>I From the East (12) Hoshino</p>
<p>At midnight, I came out of the Hawaiian village. The driver found a coconut outside the village and gave it to me as a souvenir. He also took me to see the Chinese residential area. It is said that the Chinese influence here has been gradually taken away by the Japanese. We returned to the ship, opened the coconut, and there was only a little milky juice inside. The coconut meat is white and tastes a bit like fresh lotus root and chestnut.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Boat</p>
<p>The Pacific shipping industry is now controlled by the British, American, and Japanese. The Japanese are represented by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha; this company can be said to be a part of the Japanese Navy. The ship prices are very cheap, and the tonnage is relatively small. The Americans are represented by the American Mail Line and the Dollar Steamship Company. The old Dollar was originally a Canadian and was known as the "Old Man of the Pacific." Now he is dead! His company's business is progressing very quickly. In recent years, they have built two very large trans-Pacific liners; one is the President Hoover and the other is the President Coolidge. It is said that the contents of these two ships can be compared with the largest liner in the Pacific, the Empress of Japan. The British side is represented by the China Navigation Company. The capital of this company is controlled by the British, American, and Canadian. It not only does business in the Pacific, but also controls the route from London to Canada. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), a lifeline of Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific, is the main body of this company. Although the China Navigation Company only has four ships in the Pacific, the exquisiteness of the ships is most praised by tourists. The two smaller Empress of Asia and Empress of Russia sail between Vancouver and Tokyo, Shanghai, and other ports. As for the larger Empress of Japan and Empress of Canada, they travel from Vancouver via Hawaii to various ports in the Far East. The Empress of Japan has a displacement of 40,000 tons and is the largest and fastest ship in the Pacific. I only spent seventeen and a half days on this ship from Canada to Shanghai this time.</p>
<p>Life on a Pacific ship is very interesting for those who are not afraid of wind and waves. In this 40,000-ton floating city, you can enjoy all the material life of modern civilized people: libraries, cinemas, dance halls, ballrooms, swimming pools, smoking rooms, entertainment rooms, barbershops, laundries, hotels, dining rooms, grocery stores, etc., are all cleverly arranged on the ship. Elevators go up and down, making people forget that they are at sea. Moreover, life on the ship is sometimes better than in modern big cities. The guests on the ship are not in a hurry, and the passengers meet, talk, smoke, play cards, and eat together every day, which naturally creates a close relationship. Moreover, everyone has no other purpose, and there is no material or interest separation between people, so the air on the ship is not found in modern large hotels or summer resorts.</p>
<p>Due to the decline of international trade, most of the cargo holds and cabins on trans-Pacific mail ships are empty. My fellow passengers this time were especially few, and the number of sailors was several times more than the number of passengers. Except for senior crew members, the sailors on the China Navigation Company's ships are all Cantonese. Among the passengers, there are yellow and white people. There is only one Chinese in first class, and he is also a shareholder of the China Navigation Company. There are more Chinese in second class. In third class, except for five or six Filipinos and Americans, the rest are all Chinese.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Publication The Voice of the Telecom Industry Promoting Telecommunications to Rural Areas Li Bing</p>
<p>We see the prosperity of cities, the completeness of all communication facilities, and the convenience of social use in all aspects. However, because telecommunications bureaus are not yet widespread in the interior, there are people who want to send telegrams but have no way to send them, and want to make phone calls but have no way to connect. Therefore, those who live in remote inland areas have fewer opportunities to use telecommunications than those who live in cities. If the telecommunications industry only relies on connecting large cities or important towns, then the rapid transmission of information is only a benefit enjoyed by a few people. The effectiveness of telecommunications has not been maximized, and the use of telecommunications has not been broadened. In terms of benefiting the public, it is not perfect. Therefore, urban telecommunications are important, but rural telecommunications should also be developed. Therefore, promoting telecommunications to rural areas is a point that the authorities should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Promoting telecommunications to rural areas is not difficult to believe, but it is difficult to implement. Expanding long-distance lines and expanding a large number of bureaus is limited by financial resources and cannot be done overnight. Therefore, the next level of remedial measures is no more than two ways:</p>
<p>(A) On the basis of existing trunk and branch lines, expand them separately to connect cities, towns, and villages for the purpose of connecting reports and phone calls.</p>
<p>(B) In places where no report and phone bureaus are established, post offices will deliver telegrams free of charge.</p>
<p>The former is the report and phone business agency that the Ministry of Communications expanded this year, and the latter is what is called "postal telegram transfer". With the agency for report and phone business, the nearby people can all have access to reporting and phone calls. With the implementation of postal telegram transfer, where the post office can reach, the telegram can also reach, which is both economical and convenient.</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned methods are only a kind of remedy, and the Ministry of Communications has never limited itself to this. Once the effectiveness is obvious and the business is developed, the original report and phone agency can be transformed into a new bureau, and the places that currently need postal telegram transfer will also be reduced due to the expansion of telecommunications. In short, we will observe the development of the telecommunications business and determine a plan for continuous improvement. The date of realization is not far away.</p>
<p>In the past, those in charge of telecommunications administration only focused on short-term interests and lacked long-term plans. Their attention was focused on prosperous and important cities. Occasionally, the business community in the interior would request the expansion of lines, but they would often be met with many difficulties. Now, although the measures taken in the north cannot be said to be thorough, they are enough to show the authorities' intentions, and they have already implemented the method of "promoting telecommunications to rural areas."</p>
<p>Metered Telephone Fees Kuang</p>
<p>The previous issue of this publication contained a discussion on public telephones. Telephones in various parts of our country are charged on a monthly basis and not based on the number of calls made. Therefore, busy users call frequently every day, while idle users regard the telephone as a decorative item and are happy to lend it to others. In fact, the telephone bills paid are the same. The more calls made, the lower the price. Ideally, some people who want to make phone calls but think that installing a telephone is uneconomical often ask their neighbors for help to make phone calls. This is actually a loss to the telephone bureau. Telegrams are charged by the number of words, and electric lights are charged by the number of degrees. Both are public utilities, but only telephones are not. Is this not unfair? In Europe and the United States, the number of telephone calls is used as the standard for paying fees. There are many examples of this being implemented to this day. Please allow me to explain it so that people can learn from it.</p>
<p>(A) Telephone Call Counter - Since telephone calls are charged by the number of calls, the recording of the number of calls is very important. If the driver personnel have to record each user's call each time, it will inevitably make the job busier and affect the connection (this refers to common-battery or magneto telephones). Therefore, a telephone call counter is specially installed in the telephone bureau. The form is quite exquisite and compact, like an electric meter. There are numbers on it that can rotate. As long as the current passes once, the unit of the number will also rotate once. Therefore, if a user calls and connects, the counter of that user will record it once, without any error. At the end of the month, the total number of calls can be viewed and a bill can be sent to the user to collect fees. According to this method, fees are paid for each call, which can avoid users making unlimited calls and can also eliminate the borrowing of telephones.</p>
<p>(B) Fee-Paying Telephone Device - There is also a kind that is widely used in long-distance telephones in the United States, which is called "fee-paying telephone". This method is used for long-distance telephones, and the fee for each call varies depending on the distance of the circuit. The American currency system has five cents, ten cents, and twenty-five cents. The telephone fee is also based on these three kinds of currency. For example, if A needs to call B, after the telephone is picked up and the driver personnel answers, they will instruct A to put the fee (five cents or ten cents or twenty-five cents) into the slot on the telephone. When the money falls and touches the mechanism, the driver personnel can hear the sound and can also know if it is a mistaken投. After knowing that there is no error, the connection can be made immediately. Also, if the user called is unable to talk due to a problem, the mechanism of the telephone bureau will automatically release the fee that was paid from the return slot below the telephone so that it can be returned to the original owner, without having to waste it.</p>
<p>The above is only a general description of the situation, but it can also be seen that overseas countries have also given much consideration to the problem of charging telephone calls by the number of calls. Therefore, there have been various inventions. In recent years, automatic telephones in our country have become more and more developed, and long-distance telephones have also been expanded a lot. Applying mechanical equipment to charge by the number of calls seems to be limited by economic conditions and cannot be done. Then, adding public telephones in public places and having the agents charge by the number of calls to facilitate the citizens and increase revenue may not be a way to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Explanation of the New Regulations on Telegraph Savings for Fee Reporter</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications promulgated the new regulations on telegraph savings, it has tried its best to implement telegraph price reductions within the possible scope, which has been convenient for all walks of life. However, the various new regulations on savings that have been promulgated may not be fully understood by people in society and still need to be vigorously publicized. Now, we have investigated several points raised in a letter from Zhang Yibo, manager of the Wudi Brand Zhenjiang Factory Co., Ltd., to the Telegraph Administration Department. After the Telegraph Administration Department gave a detailed explanation, we will now record the (Mr. Zhang's) questions and (the Telegraph Administration Department's) answers as follows:</p>
<p>(Question 1) When sending a telegram to a place with a registered telegraph address, adding the name of the addressee requires counting six characters.</p>
<p>Example 1 1681 Wuxi Tan Gongchen</p>
<p>According to the above example, six characters must be counted. It is more economical to use the telephone instead.</p>
<p>Example 2 Telephone 671 Wuxi Tan Gongchen</p>
<p>In the above example, it can be counted as four characters. According to this method of calculating fees, using a registered telegraph address requires adding the name of the addressee, which costs two extra characters. It is better not to use a registered telegraph address and use the telephone instead, which can save money.</p>
<p>(Answer) Article 1 of the Regulations on Registered Telegraph Addresses states: "The addressee of a telegram may choose one character to replace the name and address of the person." Therefore, according to the regulations, the registered telegraph address already includes the name of the addressee. If the name of the addressee is added after the registered telegraph address, it will become redundant. Furthermore, the method of registered telegraph addresses is to provide convenience for merchants who send and receive a lot of telegrams, while the method of replacing the addressee's address with a telephone number is to provide convenience for private households that do not send many telegrams. The two are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>(Question 2) When a telegram is sent to a place where the local telephone is divided into several districts.</p>
<p>Example 3 Concession Telephone 94013 Shanghai Tu Xiaochao</p>
<p>The right requires counting five characters. It is better not to use the telephone and use a detailed address.</p>
<p>Example 4 No. 2, Jianye Lane, Shipipi Lane, Nanshi, Shanghai Tu Xiaochao</p>
<p>It is also counted as five characters. According to the above example, using the telephone does not save money compared to using a detailed address for the telegraph fee. However, when the message is transmitted by the machine, the code used to transmit the telephone instead of the name and address is less. The more or less we pay is proportional to the amount of code that is transmitted. Now it is not so. The amount of code transmitted is the same for less and more, which is difficult to understand. Moreover, the original purpose of using the telephone to replace the name and address was to save trouble and money. Since it does not save money, what is the value of this method?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to your letter:</p>
<p>"Concession Telephone 94013 Shanghai Tu Xiaochao" needs to be counted as five characters, which is still the method recorded in the old regulations. According to Articles 4 and 9 of the New Regulations on Telegraph Savings, it should be written as:</p>
<p>"Shanghai Telephone Concession 94013 Tu Xiaochao" is only charged as four characters.</p>
<p>Comparison of Telegraph Prices in Various Countries Yiyou</p>
<p>Telegrams are a powerful tool for public communication. Some countries in the world have state-owned telegram services, such as England, Germany, France, Japan, and our country. Some are run by merchants, such as the United States. However, the fees for telegrams, whether they are state-owned or merchant-owned, must conform to the principle of "low cost." Only when the cost is low will the public be happy to use them, and the telegraph business can become popular and have hope for development. On the contrary, if the fees are high, the public will not be able to afford to send telegrams, and telegrams will</p>

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced its listed rates, with the British Pound at par and the US Dollar rising 0.125, indicating a potential easing trend. However, banks still had a buying appetite for forward US Dollars. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also bought shillings, but otherwise bank appetite was sated, leading to a calm and uneventful trading day. Later, Sassoon continued to buy shillings. Unfavorable telegrams from New China Trading Company; Bombay reported unchanged and rising 1 anna, strengthening the situation. Rumor had it that the Central Bank was releasing cash, and banks were taking advantage of the low prices to make small purchases. Bombay returned slightly by 1 anna, and the process was still even. By the close, the near-term selling prices were: British Pound at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 0.125; US Dollar at 33.8125 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British Pound and US Dollar each eased 0.03125. Chinese merchants were both buyers and sellers, and bank appetite tended to be sated.

<p>"Cutting Heads" Adding Water Opens at Five Cents</p>
<p>Recently, due to the month-end closing for silver and money businesses, business has been brisker than usual. Moreover, due to special circumstances at the end of this month, funds are quite insufficient for turnover, causing various market conditions in the market to be less sluggish than in the past. Although the interbank loan rate in the morning and afternoon markets still opened at six cents and has not improved, the "cutting heads" adding water rate has uniquely shown brilliance, opening at five cents, which is rarely seen in recent years. Looking into its internal workings, although the degree of inflation has not decreased slightly on one hand, the majority of society has already experienced a financial panic. In terms of transactions, interbank drafts, morning market transfers, and new transactions exceeded 3.8 million; afternoon market transactions exceeded 200,000; small association transactions exceeded 200,000; silver collateral transactions for redemption and new transactions exceeded 2.1 million. Bank collections and settlements also increased due to the month-end. It is estimated that foreign banks collected and settled over 3.8 million in drafts and bills; various goods, foreign exchange advances, collateral and miscellaneous collections and settlements over 5.2 million; settlement collections and settlements over 5.2 million; warehouse entry 800,000. Chinese banks collected and settled over 5.1 million in drafts and bills; various goods, foreign exchange advances, collateral and miscellaneous collections and settlements over 4.9 million; customs duties over 800,000; settlement collections and settlements over 3.8 million; warehouse withdrawals 1.2 million. Japanese banks collected and settled over 2.8 million in drafts and bills; various goods, foreign exchange advances, collateral and miscellaneous collections and settlements over 5.8 million; settlement collections and settlements over 2.8 million; warehouse withdrawals 300,000. Money shops and foreign public notes collected and settled over 43 million; foreign "cutting head" funds collected and settled over 8.9 million; various remittance funds over 700,000; banknotes collected over 900,000; issued over 1.2 million; cash collected over 700,000; customer source and destination each 300,000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total clearing volume of the Shanghai Clearing House on the 31st was 13,396,151.72 silver dollars, including 5,957,186.77 silver dollars in silver coins and 8,000,03864.95 silver dollars in clearing transfers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small silver dollars were traded at 836.5 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Morning market transactions were 5,000 jiao, and afternoon market transactions were 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver dollars were similar in both markets, with the morning market traded at 726.9 yuan and the afternoon market changed to 726.6 yuan. As a result, it also increased by 1 jiao compared to the previous day. Morning market transactions were 110,000 jiao, and afternoon market transactions were 20,000 jiao. Copper coins also increased by 500 wen compared to the previous day, to 332,000 wen, with the transaction price being 8,800 foreign dollars, equivalent to 29,216 strings of wen.</p>

<p>Last month (July), the interbank loan rate fluctuated between 5 and 6 cents. The highest price never reached 7 cents, and the lowest was no more than 4 cents. The total monthly statistic was 1.6 yuan. Calculated by averaging 31 days, the daily rate was only 5 cents and 1.61 mils. As such, it is still less than the fixed amount of 2 yuan. It is likely that when the Money Industry Association's board meeting proposes the deposit interest rate case tomorrow, it will still be discounted at 2.95 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, on the 31st, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market had the potential for a sharp rise. Before the opening, market sentiment was extremely good, because Huang Fu's trip to the north could be unimpeded, and the savings reserve rate had been announced, with the implementation period not far away. In the future, market chips will inevitably feel extremely depleted. Only because there was a large batch of selling on the 4th, the market price was slightly frustrated. But its trend, falling and then rising, is naturally due to temporary high pressure. Stopping slightly, it will inevitably rise sharply, and the 80% market price is bound to be reached eventually. Yesterday, the opening rise was very strong, with demobilization rising 1.23 yuan. After entering, because the 4th was frantically selling, the entrants avoided the heavy and took the light, absorbing on a small scale. The market price started from the 20th level and immediately appeared powerless and gradually became weak. Gold short fell back by 7 jiao, and the previous column's return to fall was expected. After entering, the entrants were fierce again, and the booming atmosphere already felt unable to be suppressed. The reaction immediately arose. Therefore, since the unified salt tax, it has gradually risen by 1 jiao to 6 jiao. The final market price showed that the previous column rose 1 jiao to 4 jiao and a half, and the 20th year rose a little bit to 4 jiao. Only 96 was particularly good, rising 4 jiao to 5 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was about 25 million yuan. The rise and fall situation is listed below:</p>

<p>According to a report from New China Trading Company, the New York stock market yesterday (the 30th) saw quiet trading and weak prices. Transactions of mailed stocks were particularly sluggish due to the drought and impending disaster, which is bound to reduce the purchasing power of farmers in the Midwest. However, the market gradually rebounded at the close. Various shares on the small exchange were also slightly lower than before. The bond market was mixed, with US government bonds up slightly. Foreign bonds showed mixed ups and downs, and German bonds fell slightly. Commodities, including mixed grains, rose due to the drought and inevitable poor harvest. The total volume for the day was 810,000 shares. (Securities) After initial weakness in specific stocks in the morning, the market recovered well. If the news remains favorable, prices should continue to rise. (Mixed grains) After initial declines in wheat in the morning, buying interest intensified and prices soared. According to preliminary private reports, the wheat harvest is estimated at 475 million bushels and corn at 161.6 million bushels. Losses of corn in the fields continue. In general, it is advisable to buy when prices fall. (Cotton) The market rose due to private estimates favoring long positions. Current cotton export demand is poor, and cloth sales are also sluggish, but the foundation is solid. Cotton mills have reduced production by 25%, with the possibility of further reductions. The New York Cotton Exchange estimates total consumption at 13,564,000 bales and inventory at 10,083,600 bales. (Rubber) The market generally rose due to purchases from US manufacturers. According to estimates from Singapore, traders are still stockpiling, and the amount on the market has decreased by 11,000 tons compared to last month, indicating a strong technical position.

<p>Yarn and cotton float urgently to cover positions.</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and a rising trend is emerging. US cotton is rebounding, and current yarn demand in North China is strong. Tianjin merchants continue to procure, so the sentiment is bullish, and buying interest is stronger. Floating positions are particularly urgent to cover. However, Japanese traders' short positions remain calm. The future depends on actual sales for advances and retreats.</p>

<p>The opening of the yarn market in the morning was tight. Because US cotton rose, there was a lack of sellers in the market, and the situation turned firm. All months rose by 7-8 jiao to 1.2 jiao. There was no change even after the second and third rounds of trading. As a result, all months rose by 7.8 jiao to 1.1, 2.3 jiao. Transactions totaled 19,600 bales.

<p>Guangdong 605 Mainland 285 Yunnan 180 Shantou 105</p>
<p>The cotton market has been fluctuating for many days. Today, with the help of rising US cotton, the rising trend suddenly became fierce. Generally, shorts see that the weather for foreign cotton is too dry, and fear that there will be another rising trend, so more people are covering their short positions. But some say that the domestic cotton production situation is not bad at present, and there are many people selling when prices rise.</p>

<p>At the opening of standard cotton in the morning, with US cotton, which had been fluctuating for several days, rising again, the buying interest in the market slightly increased, and shorts covered their positions. However, the majority of longs remained calm. It is predicted that US cotton will still have a peak in the future. Rui Da will release yarn and import cotton, so the cotton market has become more expensive. However, Hubei merchants are selling when prices rise, because yarn mills are not managing it. As a result, each month rose by 3.5 jiao to 6 jiao, and the total transaction volume was 76,500 dan. It is estimated that Da Fu sold 12,100 dan, Da Feng 2,900 dan, Yuan Da 1,100 dan, Tong Xing 2,300 dan, Da Chang 2,000 dan, Xin Cheng 1,500 dan, Chang He 2,900 dan.

<h3 id="e246">The lack of rain in the drought area has led to many buyers and US cotton has formed a high tide of rise. <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was strong due to the cotton harvest being favorable to buyers, lack of rain in the drought area, and enthusiastic buyers. As a result, spot goods rose by 20 pounds, futures rose by 20 to 23 pounds, and British cotton futures rose by 4 to 6 points. Indian cotton was firm due to speculative buying. As a result, Pingguo'er rose by 2 rupees, Aomula rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 jiao, and Bairoxi rose by 3 rupees and 2.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (30th Electric)</p>

<p>The powder futures are being delivered without a market. The total number of delivery warehouse receipts is only 37,000 bags of returned goods from the Bund. Because most of the warehouse receipts have been directly offset in advance, the actual appetite of the trades has been satisfied. For this month's warehouse receipts, they have mostly been withdrawn for cash and loaded at any time. Therefore, before delivery, cash has been gradually withdrawn and loaded, and a part has been recovered by shorts. Therefore, only these returned goods from the Bund remain at the end of the month. This batch of warehouse receipts is withdrawn and loaded by Beiyang trades such as Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, and Yantai for actual sales.</p>
<p>The wheat futures market is closed due to the month-end settlement, and there are not many spot deliveries at the end of the month, because they have already been directly reported and offset. A total of 18 cars are currently delivered, which were released on the 27th, etc., and the receivers are the 28th, etc. They are probably distributed by the factory. In addition, there are also 30-40 cars that are directly offset. Foreign wheat has risen by another 3-5 jiao. Spot wheat is bullish due to the rise in foreign wheat, and the factory appetite is particularly greedy. Yesterday, it rose by another 4-5 fen. A total of 16,000 bags were opened throughout the day, which were received by Fu Xin, etc. High-grade wheat is 3.55-3.5 yuan, and medium and secondary grades are 3.45-3.17 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Dongxin Japonica rice in the north of Shanghai has fallen by half a yuan <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were slightly more sources from various trades, estimated to be 17-18, (about nearly 3,000 shi) while the sales in the market were still average. Therefore, there were some sellers who shouted high prices, and some who shouted fixed prices, so the situation was uncertain. However, by the close of the market, the overall situation was still calm. For example, Japonica rice and green-cornered Songsi and other late rice from Chang Trade, Su Trade, and South Harbor, etc., had no ups and downs, while Du Yangjian had no honor or disgrace, and Yin changed, and there was no market for Yuan goods. Pudong new Japonica rice still opened at 12 yuan.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of the river was 11-12, and the sales in the market moved slightly. The market price of white japonica rice increased by about 1 jiao, the thin rice, Yang Du Bu Jian stabilized, and the customer tip price increased by nearly a jiao. The source of Dongxin Japonica rice was quite prosperous, estimated to be more than 400 shi, but retail sales were flat, resulting in a price drop of half a yuan.</p>
<p>After Saigon Rice Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e249">Foreign Rice Rise Suddenly Killed <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign Ke Xian rice, initially due to inland greedy purchases, the sentiment and the market continued to rise, and the arrival was not prosperous, and the inventory at the bottom was getting thinner every day, the market atmosphere was quite tense. After the opening price, the high-grade and each grade rose uniformly, especially Xiang Xian and brown rice were popular. Xiang rice opened 1,720 bags of Ji Jing and Jing Ji oil brown rice, Wuxian 700 bags, Shashi Ji Xian 230 bags, Chuzhou Ji Xian 1,000 bags, Shashi Hankou and other brown rice 3,500 bags, totaling 8,150 bags. Except for more than 100 bags in this street, all were purchased by the mainland, and the price was a large corner higher than the previous market. There is not much foreign rice in the market, and it is still continuing to be bullish. However, yesterday, the French company’s ship Yan Lu shipped 19,500 bags of No. 1 round-grain Saigon. This batch was loaded by the experts themselves in Shanghai, and after adding donations and taxes, the cost was 45 jiao higher than in Shanghai. The experts were unwilling to sell at a loss due to the high cost, so they did not show samples after arrival, waiting for a good price to sell again. However, the news of the import has been rumored in the market, and those who asked about foreign rice were watching and unmoved. Xiaowen rice should have risen by 1-2 jiao yesterday, but because of this news, the rising trend was immediately frustrated. The whole city opened 600 bags of Chen Xiaowen, which were purchased by the Ningbo Trade, and the price was 8.68 yuan, which was softer than the previous market. It has been affected by the new arrival of Saigon.</p>
