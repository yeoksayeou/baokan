<h3>法蘇結納與遠東政局敬</h3>
<p>自奥總理陶爾菲斯被刺以後。歐洲政局卽顯呈動摇現象。以保持現狀及維繫凡爾賽和約爲傳統政策之法蘭西。感覺十分惶懼。深恐在歐洲大陸之霸權不保。急起而聨蘇。於是是法蘇兩國因對德利害關係。乃由諒解而接近。最近且有軍事同盟之説。就兩國旣往之邦交而論。外交上之携手。或有可能。吾人以爲蘇聨遷就法人希望而加入國際聨盟。猶近事理。若謂法蘇訂結軍事同盟。則未免神經過敏。須知法蘭西之傳統計外。交向以維持凡爾賽和約爲指歸。而本意則在穏定其歐洲霸權因此曾引起英國之反感。招惹意大利之不平。以致波蘭脱離法國覊絆。而與德國締結友好恊約。聲明遇事和平恊商。而不以兵戎相見。此外多腦河畔諸國。亦皆漸現離心傾向。此法人所以不得不籌劃彌補之策也。蘇聨自獨立建樹社會主義國家之後。亟需和平安全以培養其國民之元氣。故與西歐鄰近諸國如芬蘭波蘭及波羅的海三小國皆力謀接近。其所締結之互不侵犯條約。期限延長至於一九四五年。實可證其居心之無他。本年六月莫斯科政府又得捷克南斯拉夫等國之承認。東歐和平之基礎乃更形穏固。　　法國鑒於蘇聨之政策。與已并無衝。突且有益於現狀之保持。故引爲患難同志。努力拉攏。使爲國聨之一員。蓋國聨自日德退出及意大利倡議改組以來。卽陷於日暮途窮之境。如不速圖補救。卽有崩潰之虞。届時法國將失其外交上之憑藉。再不能運用凡爾賽和約中之盟約條文。以爲制裁德國之藉口。蘇聨固明知法國之企圖純然爲已。然又不得不力與周旋者。以德意志自希特勒執政後。卽利用波蘭爲前衛。有直衝烏克蘭及假道波羅的海畔三小國。以侵俄之勢。聞蘇聨曾向德提議。共同保障三小國之獨立。締結和平條約。但德國則認爲三小國係獨立國。且無被侵之虞。拒絶此議。於是蘇聨危懼愈深。德。蘇國交愈僵。因而亦感覺有加入國聨與法接近之需要。　　言夫法蘇關係。吾人所不可忽視者。厥爲蘇聨對遠東問題之策應是也。蘇聨之於西歐。爲其國境安全計。向以（息事寗人）四字爲其根本國策。惟於東亞則不然。頃者。日本已盡量暴露其軍國主義之面目。匪特欲乘機刦取中東鐵道。且將一鼓而席捲東部西比利亞及外蒙古。蘇聨安得不嚴爲之防。日人對俄之軍事所以遲遲而未發動者。原因頗多。姑略舉其犖犖大者。則第一因英國之援助。尚無充分把握。此於英日商業競爭。已可見其端倪。日人雖頗欲設法挽回。以求英人諒解。而彼此芥蒂已深。能否轉圜。猶屬疑問。第二則因日本國内天然富源之貧乏。與意國較。僅稍勝一籌。卽如鐵鑛埋藏量。最多不過一萬萬噸。如八幡等處主要製鐵廠。端賴馬來鐵鑛及我國大冶鐵鑛等之供給。否則卽難以爲繼。重工業步人後塵。對外作戰。自居不利。他如美國消費力减縮。日絲輸出慘落。農村經濟危殆。國際情勢多變。外交方針至難把握。軍事計劃動受影響。凡此諸端。亦爲吾人意想所可及。然蘇聨爲策軍事及國防之安全。終不敢高枕而臥。此次與法結納。所以促成西歐之安全。亦卽所以布置東亞之戰陣也。蘇俄宣布</p>

<h3>日本非常時期突轉緊急（日本通信）</h3>
<p>外交日趨惡化　　内政愈見棘手岡田内閣組成以後、日本政治上一般情况、似乎風平浪靜、大有克服所謂非常時期的可能、但事實上有兩支巨大的暗流、使日本國民及政治當局特别關心、第一是所謂外交問題、特别是對美外交、自廣田·赫爾交換公文之後、日美之間的暗礁、好像因潮水上漲而掩飾過去、所以她很樂觀、以爲太平洋上可告無事了、加以對華對英都有相當充分的把握、日本頗自信是足以樂觀的、於是特派近衛文磨公爵（貴族中的優秀政治家、與荒木閥關係很密切）赴美、一面探聽美國的眞實情形、同時設法使日美次第接近、一面運用日本的外交手腕、使日本的海軍計劃得以實現、則西太平洋的覇權可以樹立起來、遠東的優越利益更得到一重保障了、殊不知事實的傾向恰恰相反、美國對遠東方面的認識固然和日本不同、并且以爲日本過於毒辣、所以刀要加緊珍珠港的防備、要編一隊飛行機去偵察阿拉斯加、在亞留仙羣島某處建設空軍根據地、由此證明日美之間的暗礁、依然藏在那裏、近衛公爵并没有法子能够除去、還有英日關係、就理論上講、就某方面、尤其是對蘇聨的問題上、差不多是在一條綫上、很可以成立政治上的聨盟、以共同制服蘇聨、平分太平洋上覇權、然而實際利害、如遠東市塲的分割、如棉製物品的銷塲、在在都與英帝國相衝突、并且是極其尖鋭的衝突、這事情很不容易用和平方法得到適當的解决、因此日英政治聨盟是會受影響的、日本外交當局鑑於對蘇危機日益迫切、以後外交再不可陷於孤立狀態、所以竭力主張岡田内閣最主要的工作中打開外交局面、將英美關係敷衍好、將中國完全抓在手裏、這樣就足以對付蘇聨、實行其大亞細主義了、那裏曉得她本身竟發生了很重大的問題、所以另有第二種主張出來、　　其次是關於日本的内政、特别是農村問題、這是日本當前的最大難題、就一般社會而論、農村不安會引起整個社會矛盾的展開、例如生絲市價下跌、跟着是春繭價格低落、據日本帝國農會的槪算、因繭價跌落的關係、農村收入要减少一萬萬八千萬圓日金、轉瞬秋繭又要上市了、而生絲市塲并没有暢銷的希望、前途的危機、眞不知道要怎樣纔能彌縫得了、何况日本農村負債和前兩年差不多、總數在七十萬萬圓日金以上、最近米價雖然略爲上漲了些、但農民并没有受到什麽實惠、還要把現錢買貴米吃、所以依舊非常的窮困、其次是工商業界負債總額在一百五十萬萬圓左右、這雖不得謂之致命傷、即也是金融界的一大癌腫、設使對外輸出略受打擊、眼前所謂的（景氣）馬上就會停頓、工商業界的破綻就會露出來、現在印度和英屬其他自治領殖民地、都在限制日本製造品的輸入、荷屬南洋羣島又繼起實行、日荷會議又難得有利的妥恊、其他世界各地經濟現像、都并不見好、則日本的輸出究竟是未可樂觀的、這樣一來、單靠軍事工業、恐怕很不容易維持現時的市面繁榮、何况目今所謂繁榮、并不充實呢、加以今年日本國内受旱災影響的地方很多、米價逐步飛漲、於農民没有好處、收成太壞、將更引起農村的不安、因爲形勢激化的結果、所以政府方面也認爲這是燃眉之急、似乎應該擺在前該面、趕快的解决、否則整個的經濟危機一旦爆發、禍害是農會比外交的孤立、更加厲害、本身不統一的岡田内閣、正在那裏極力籌劃、想調和這兩個問題、預備在外交上、在内政上、穏立其戰爭的基礎、但是事實上竟没有可以兩全之道、（一九三四年八月十日於東京）英殖民地</p>

<h3>人民心理的演變</h3>
<p>我國人對於國事、向來守着（不在其位不謀其政）的古訓、態度觀望、不但一般無知識老百姓是這樣、就是知識階級份子、也大多數是這樣、就以當漢奸的作日人走狗的來説吧、若是説他們不愛中國反而愛日本、這是出乎人情以外、絶對没有的事、那麽、他們爲什麽要去當漢奸作走狗呢、原因雖多、總括起來説、就是完全站在自己的立塲上、只知道有家、不知道有國、近來因爲受到日人種種的壓迫、才曉得以前所想得與現在的事實、是完全相反、於是覺悟了國破家是不會存在的、家和國是不可分的、并且國重於家、所以近來東北各處民衆、毁家救國的很多、我們在人民心理的演變過程中、加以探討應當特别注意的、就是在事變以後、不到三年的時光、心理演變異常迅速、詳細的分晰起來、可以别爲四個階段、第一、在九一八後的一年中、多數人的心理、只要能過太平日子、全是抱冷靜的態度、甚有妄想歡迎日本能依法統治希望、得享安居樂業的幸福、第二、是從去歲夏季開始、看到日本將軍政大權都攪過去了、又聨想到朝鮮亡國後的悲慘、起了大的恐慌、但又自度力量差欠、難打倒高壓的勢力、發生一種暫且忍耐的心理、第三、是因爲去秋日人調查户口、登記物品苛招雜税、層出不窮、乃感覺到欲求過太平日子是夢想、於是腦海裏邊起了疑問、到處可以聽到（怎麽辦呢）這類不約而同的問話這一點可以證明廣大的羣衆、已由不管的心理、走到要想方法來應付的途徑、但是仍表理着不敗反抗的　情、抱着小心　愼的態度、第額最鉅之商品爲棉織品、是以英國棉織業中心地蘭開夏市面之漲落、卽可代表英國全國之經濟狀况之盛衰、而英國棉織品之銷路、除遠東之中國外、皆恃其殖民地爲尾閭、故殖民地之市場、與英國本國實有極大之關係、但自日本實行傾銷政策後、英國棉織品在印度之市塲先受威脅、英國不得已、乃有宣佈廢日印通商條約之舉、日貨在印度之傾銷、乃稍受限制、但日人受此挫折、並不灰心、轉向英國之南洋殖民地、積極實行傾銷、致年來馬來亞及錫蘭等地之棉織品市塲、日貨充斥、英貨幾至不能立足、英政府不得已、乃於本年五月中、再取更嚴厲之政策、通令全殖民地實行棉織品統制、以限制日貨之進口、尾加坡及馬來亞等地、業已相繼施行、惟此項政策、近忽有一意外之波折、卽在印度半島南、英國之另一殖民地錫蘭、其政府及人民、以限制棉織品入口律例頒佈後、廉價之日貨、勢必代以高價之英貨、與當地人民之生計、將發生極重大之影響、故曾表示反對、且聞錫蘭政府中之部長、有全體辭職力爭之意、一時英國之政策、似已受到一極大之打擊、直至本月一日、各部長又舉打一非正式會議、方最後决定取銷辭職、且同意接受英政府所頒外國棉織品入口限制律例、英國對日之政策、乃又得進一步之成功、故我人認爲英國對日貨傾銷之防禦戰綫、業已完全形成、变無不可矣、</p>

<h3>人民心理的演變</h3>
<p>我國人民對於國事、向來守着（不在其位不謀其政）的古訓、態度觀望、不但一般無知識老百姓是這樣、就是知識階級分子、也大多數是這樣、就以當漢奸的作日人走狗的來説吧、若是説他們不愛中國反而愛日本、這是出乎人情以外絶對没有的事、那麽、他們爲什麽要去當漢奸作走狗呢、原因雖多、總括起來説、就是完全站在自己的立塲上、只知道有家、不知道有國、近來因爲受到日人種種的壓迫、才曉得以前所想得與現在的事實、是完全相反、於是覺悟了國破家是不會存在的、家和國是不可分的、并且國重於家、所以近來東北各處民衆、毁家救國的很多、我們在人民心理的演變過程中、加以探討、應當特别注意的、就是在事變以後、不到三年的時光、心演變異常迅速、詳細的分晰起來、可以别爲四個階段、第一、在九一八後的一年中、多數人的心理、只要能過太平日子、全是抱冷靜的態度、甚有妄想歡迎日本能依法統治希望、得享安居樂業的幸福、第二、是從去歲夏季開始看到日本將軍政大權都攬過去了、又聨想到朝鮮亡國後的悲慘、起了大的恐慌、但又自度力量差欠、難打倒高壓的勢力、發生一種暫且忍耐的心理、第三、是因爲去秋日人調查户口、登記物品苛捐雜税、層出不窮、乃感覺到欲求過太平日子是夢想、於是腦海裏邊起了疑問、到處可以聽到、怎麽（辦呢）這類不約而同的問話、這一點可以證明廣大的羣衆、已由不管的心理、走到要想法來應付的途徑、但是仍表理着不敗反抗的　情、抱着小心謹愼的態度、第四、是在今春因爲實行繳地照、收槍械、征壯丁、並按户挑選青年婦女備日軍解决獸慾、於是人人自危、知道以前所想的、完全錯誤、不但過太平日子的希望没有、就是自家已完全失掉保障、乃不顧一切的、起來抗日、如吉東之依蘭·延壽·密山·勃利等縣的民衆、明知力量有限、也要揭竽而起、這種表現、是由懼怕日本的心理、變爲仇視、形成敵對和誓不兩立的局面、演變到了現階段之下、一般民衆裏面所表現的、是充滿着抗日的情緒、故不問其事如何、其人爲誰、凡能同情抗日、助我實力者、都親之愛之、反是、則仇之悵之、東北人民的心理、現在到了這個地步、將來演變到如何的程度、不難推測、因爲以前東北地大物博、人民生活容易、益以家安不問其他的思想、任何外來的力量、是衝不動的、現在農村破産、人民失業、經濟奇緊、個人生活發生恐慌、父母妻子離散、一切的一切完全喪失、彷彿由天堂樂土、完全掀到地獄苦海裏面、其打擊之甚、刺激之深、是以形容的、</p>
<h3>義軍及僞軍心理</h3>
<p>東北過去一般士兵的心理、只知道有長官、不知道有國家、吃國家的餉、當長官的兵、以維持個人生活、長官只知道有自己、用國家的餉、養自己的兵、故事變之後、當官的只知有自己、於是爲保持自己祿位、去作日人的爪牙、殘殺自己的同胞、笑駡任人笑駡、亡國我自爲之、近來感到官雖高而無權、每日又須准時辦公、按時而退、非特不如以前之舒服、稍有不愼、即爲日人所辱、此刻已是嘗足了亡國大夫的滋味、均在飲泣吞聲、待時反正、即有眞正親日的、也是個人奴顔婢膝自去逢迎、不敢以長官地位去驅使他人、恐部下叛變、對自怀的生命、發生色險、至於士兵方面、前此爲維持生活、咸持忍耐一時的心理、近以軍隊屢次縮編、迭經淘汰、不如持槍而逃、以過　處得吃産無拘束的生活、同時因爲參加義軍、并可去掉亡國奴的頭銜、所謂一舉數得、何樂不爲、故最近僞軍多有持械潛逃之事發生、亦見僞軍心理之一斑、至義勇軍的心理和背影、亦甚複雜、歸納起來、可分數種、有爲激於民族意識迫於義憤而加入者、有爲環境所迫而加入者、有爲生活所迫而加入者、有爲宣傳主義而加入者、現在統因感受物質缺乏、力量單薄、欲進不得、欲退無路、惟一渴望得到實力援助、其他在所不計、此種現象、可以説由利已的心理、變成利羣的心理、現在吉林賓縣·阿城·珠河·延壽·方正·勃利·密山·寳清·依蘭·樺川·富錦·饒河·虎林·綏濱·同江·等十五縣義軍首領三十餘人、其人數達二十餘萬、如有相當人員前往、加以編制、助以實力、收復失地、實意中事</p>
<h3>日本軍隊的狀况</h3>
<p>日本軍隊、就表面上看、訓練有素、似有可觀、但與日兵常見之人、每見彼青年軍人、向之涕泣而訴、稱家有父母兄弟、恐今生不能回國相見、言時涙隨聲下、此雖不敢槪括一切、也可見一斑、日軍佔東北之時、處處表現其國家之武力强盛、如飛機的表演、大砲的陳列等等以少數軍隊、每佔一城、輒東出西進、循環不已、以形其多、近來因日俄情形緊張、將以前零星軍隊、均行集中、在黑龍江方面、則集中於北安鎭·及札蘭屯·省城等處、吉林方面、則集中於長春·佳木斯·一面坡·等處、外縣僅留參事官和指導官二人、又因各處義軍蠧起、少數軍隊、分往各處、實際上非但無剿除義軍力量、並且時有被義軍消滅之虞、此爲促成日軍集中之最大原因、日本分駐各處的屯墾軍、多無紀律、時與當地人民發生衝突、如依蘭縣湖南營、駐有該軍二百餘人、對於地畝、任意徴收、對於婦女、隨便調戲、時常赤身露體、衝入民宅、看見婦女、即云、性交性交）、激起民變、此是主因、日軍每次出發進攻義軍時、避走小路、且令僞軍在前、日軍在後、以防義軍射擊、但日僞軍隊所着衣裝不同、義軍因與僞軍互通聲氣、伏在暗中、對於在前之僞軍、多不射擊、專對日掃射、因此日軍責難僞軍與義軍勾結、故將以前東北正式軍隊、全行縮编、以地方之游擊隊補充、又恐游擊隊有通義軍情事、每在出發時、僅給子彈二十粒、近來鑒於僞軍時常叛變、乃厲行保甲制度、挑選家有産業之民兵、以防其叛變、惟日軍無論其採用何種方法、均屬無效、故現在對於吉東之軍、不敢積極進攻、以防羣起響應、</p>
<h3>東北經濟之狀况</h3>
<p>東北紙幣、以前種種頗多、錢法極形紊亂、惟經濟基礎未爲穏定、人民并不恐慌、自事變以後、僞國擬定統一錢法、發行僞滿洲國幣、定今年六月底、將以前各種紙幣、槪行取消、近因事實未能行通、又展期一年、考其未能取銷的原因、以人民對新出之僞滿洲國幣、多恐將來成爲廢紙、發生不信任的心理、反覺以前各種紙幣、比僞滿洲國幣尚有價值、又因僞滿洲國幣初次發行過多、兼有停兌之趨勢、恐陷俄國羗帖（盧布）的覆轍、近因日本繳收地照、增加捐税、人民經濟現狀、愈形困難、前此東北人民以土地和糧石爲經濟活動之根本、現在糧價奇跌、如大豆一項、在事變前、每石二十元左右、現售洋一元五角、尚屬有行無市、此種情形、吉東一帶尤甚、人民交易咸以烟土代貨幣、故東北吸食鴉片者、較以前增加十分之七、糧旣不值錢、土地復隨時有被繳照之危險、故一般産權、多在動摇之中、故有土地人家與無土地之人家相等、一般人之心理、有錢寗可買肉吃、不去買地種並且工資貴於糧食、種地人家、皆以種地爲維持生活計、所出之糧、足食即可、不復希望以糧換錢、作經濟的活動、故現在可耕之田、以前種十垧者、現僅種一二垧、以維生活、如吉東一帶、十五縣地面、僅有三四縣種田者、并以種大烟爲多、其餘各縣、義軍雲集、日軍焚毁房屋、人民皆逃避一空、誠如杜詩所云、（國破山河在、城春草木深）這滿目荒凉悽慘的景象、眞令人心痛欲碎了、</p>
<h3>教育狀况</h3>
<p>自事變後、所有各處學校、不分大小、均以日語日文爲主要課程、關於舊日歷史地理等科目、均付闕如、小學裏面、三字經百家姓千字文等書、大走紅運、中學率以經書宣傳所謂王道迎合舊的心理、麻醉青年又在長春設立大同學院、造就高級奴化人才、在該院讀書者、均爲各縣選送之教員、各處中等學校、均以日人教日文、名爲教員、實際監督校内教員和學生的言動、作文題目、以宣傳所謂王道和日滿共存共榮爲主旨、不准發揮其他言論、對於教員薪金、採併校加薪辦法、使學校數目减少、日人教員薪金增加、學生人數、用嚴格的考試來限制、名爲整頓教育、實際使青年無讀書的塲所、故東北青年、大有失學之嘆、</p>
<h3>政治狀况</h3>
<p>僞組織的政治、在表面上看、溥儀由僞執政而得僭位皇帝、彷彿政治上有了重心、一切可以獨斷獨了、事行、其實溥儀自僭位後、連蓋章的資格都取消無大小、悉操於日本關東司令菱刈之乎、最近因爲發表某項公文、溥儀表示不甚贊同、被菱刈大加侮辱、卒至道歉、並表示以後不再發生同樣事件方休、可見傀儡之不易爲了、至於各縣之一切措施、悉由日參事官處理、縣長等於虚設、國内各報、時常登載日（滿）訂立各種條約、日人强佔某處礦産等等、實屬隔靴搔癢之消息、在實際上、無所謂（滿洲國）、東北一切財富、完全攫於日人之手、予取予求、如入無人之境、我們把日（滿）看成了兩個東西、是完全錯誤的、</p>
<h3>商業狀况</h3>
<p>自事變後、日本爲把持一切商業起見、將各種企業公司、均採托辣斯的辦法、形成大聨合、如航業大聨合、無論公私輪船、不得單獨營業、運貨有定價、航行有定期、所有一切開支用人等事、均由聨合公會辦理、會内一切、全由日人主持、船主毫無實權、麵粉公司亦然、按機器馬力大小、規定一切、股東不得隨意抽股、或支配經濟、以是東北各大商業、因經濟不穏固、社會不安定、均抱縮减思想、不求發展、而小本營業、亦均係隨來隨賣的性質、槪不賒欠、因農村破産、農民全無購買力、與城市商號、大有不相往來之勢、因是經濟周轉方面、完全停頓、</p>
<h3>交通狀况</h3>
<p>日本自强佔東北後、積極修築公路鐵道、以便對内消滅義軍、對外鞏固國防、新修的鐵路、爲吉敦·（京）圖·（由長春至圖們江）拉濱·（由吉林東拉法站至哈爾濱）北黑·（由北安鎭至黑河）將來各路告成、對軍事上、不但運輸便利、並可减少運輸時間義軍恐其鐵路完成、完全無活動餘地、故隨時伺隙拆毁焚燒路橋外、並對於築路工人、多加殘殺、而日本復對於勞工、多用欺騙手段、例如每日言明給工資一元或一元五角者、實際上數月不發一次、倘有勞工聚衆索薪之事、即予以共黨暴動的罪名、加以屠殺、近如密山方面、日人用機槍慘斃工人三千餘名、即其實例、因此、前募工人、大半星散、各處工程、均有停滯之勢、日本對於汽車路、多强迫各地民户無代價修築、毫不顧及春耕與農忙、人民旣不得報酬反遭莫大損失、且須加重擔負、每垧地現已增捐至一元五角以上咸呌苦不止、</p>
<h3>措施乖謬</h3>
<p>日人爲防止抗日反僞份子活動、曾飭令警察、嚴查户口、民户如有親友前來投宿者、須先向百户長掛號、否則一經查出、即以窩藏匪人論罪、在外作事歸里者亦須報告警署、否則以來去不明科罪、最近調查民户所有一切物品、如鷄·鴨·鵝·狗·均須註册、每月納捐四五角不等、一經註册、如有短少、須受懲罰、所以近來每聞警士下鄉調查時、均大啖鷄鴨之肉、以免註册納税、古語云、（殺的鷄犬不留、正是東北現在的實况、此外凡成件物品、亦須登記、限制轉移、因此人心恐慌、均有朝不保夕之憂色、　　凡此種種、足見東北同胞、日處水深火熱之中、非急圖收復、則未來隠憂、正有不堪設想者也、（東北社）</p>

<p>現銀洶湧外溢</p>
<h3>本市銀界集議補救</h3>
<p>前晚假中央銀行三樓縝密磋商　　本市華商重要銀行領袖均參加</p>
<h3>盼政府速頒應付方策俾减銀市恐慌</h3>
<p>申時社訊、美國銀價提高後、滬市現銀、最近呈洶湧流出現象、已引起我國銀市重大恐慌、本市銀行界爲謀安定市面起見、特於十七日夜間、在中央銀行三樓集議、各重要銀行領袖、均參加討論、會商補救辦法、盼政府速定應付白銀危機方針、以資防範現銀繼續大量流出、特探誌詳情如次、</p>
<h3>洶湧流出銀市恐慌</h3>
<p>自美總統羅斯福厲行白銀政策實行將白銀收歸國有後、白銀價格、節節昇高、現紐約及倫敦兩銀市中心之銀價、已超出滬市價格、而美方爲貫澈其政策、對於白銀需要量仍鉅、並繼續向外吸收、故本市洋商銀行、及一小部份華商銀行、因有利可圖、大做套頭、將國内存銀、大批運經孟買·倫敦·而轉入紐約、自本年一月至七月、現銀出超已達六千萬、本月份運出亦達千五百萬、日内因各方傳政府卽將决定應付辦法、白銀出口將更形踴躍、現洋商麥加利·匯豐·花旗·正金·等銀行日内將繼續有大批現銀裝運出口、近日銀市、各方已形成恐慌狀態、</p>
<h3>銀界集議共謀補救</h3>
<p>近一二日來、此種大量現銀之出超、雖最短期内、尚不致有顯著之影響於我國金融及實業之基礎、但長此而往、必將引起我國國内金融市塲之極度不安、本市銀行界爲切身利害、及企圖安定目前銀市計、特於十七日夜七時起、假黄浦灘中央銀行三樓集議、互相交換意見、及討論最近現銀大量流出防止辦法、與華商銀行應取之一致態度各要點、互相縝密討論、達數小時、參加者計有中國銀行貝淞蓀、上海銀行陳光甫、中央銀行陳行、交通銀行唐壽民、金國寳、浙江興業徐新六、金城銀行吳藴齋、及各主要銀行國外匯兌部主任等各要員、均參加討論、</p>
<h3>切盼政府速定對策</h3>
<p>該集議内容、事後各關係方面均守秘密、據向方刺探結果、得悉此次銀行界集議、主要目的、在討論一具體意見、貢獻政府、切盼早日確定應付對策、蓋銀界鑒於白銀逐日大量流出、主要原因、固在美方銀價之提高、但我政府對此迄無確實補救方策之實行、而一般外商銀行、又恐政府突有禁止或增税率之政令、爲圖重利、致銀量流出、益形增加、故政府如能卽定補救方法、此種恐慌程度、卽可望减低、銀量流出、當可减少、此外對於政府將來所取應付辦法之增加銀税、及禁止銀出口等、亦有詳細討論、將擬具意見、俾供政府之參考</p>
<h3>貝淞蓀談暫時鎭靜</h3>
<p>申時社記者昨叩詢中國銀行經理貝淞蓀氏之意見、據貝氏談、此次集合銀行界同業各領袖談話、係因最近白銀流出過鉅、一部份頗形恐慌、故特集合談話、對目前情形、分别交換意見、加以討論、據個人之意見、最近白銀大量流出、對我國確有若干不利趨勢、惟目前尚不致形成如何過分不良程度、蓋我國現存銀尚多、自歐戰後、卽每年均有大量白銀入口、一時尚不致有如何可怕之影響、故吾人目前應暫持鎭靜、設策應付、謀根本救濟、徒然自擾、殊無補實際、</p>
<h3>林康侯談切身關係</h3>

<h3>學習理論與學習技術</h3>
<p>讀書指導：　　讀了七月十四日（釋實踐）的讀書問答，内中有（第一第二種對於實踐觀，都只看到目前壓在他頭上的個個事實。他們一方面是苟安墮落，一方面是想靠增進自己的技能，戰勝不可遜免的失業恐慌）。又説：（技術不能忘記終究的目的）。　　過去的我，差不多就如你們所提引的第二種人一樣，打算盤，唸外國語，習字，想（個入來克服這現狀下不可避免的巨力－失業）。以求（在維持現實下苟安一時），因爲擺在我們面前的事實－生活問題、照示我·我以爲學得我一些技能便是唯一的出路。　　直到現在爲止，我已瞭然非整個社會大衆有出路，個人想從僥倖中討生活是太危險了，但是僅知其然不知其所以然是不行的，所以我想讀一些理論的書籍；同時我又感到要練習技能去謀生的迫切、所只好捨棄理論，暫時偏重於技術的方理。不知我所取的態度究竟對不對、請你們加以指導。　　學習理論與學習技術　　－答陳宣三君　　你所提出來的問題是非常重要的。我們相信，這樣的問題一定不只你一個人才有。現在社會整千整萬的店員以及一切靠自己的全副勞力來維持最低限度生活的人們，誰不是頭上（壓着個個的事實一，一面想求個人生活的解决而不能解决、一面想認識社會的病源同時又不能忘了個人的生活，想讀一點理論的書，同時又感覺到不能不習技術。這一羣的矛盾應如何的解决呢？　　我們現在且先説讀書罷！我們要明白，我們讀理論的書，並不是要成爲一個飽讀的學者，這是我們一再説過的。我們更要瞭解，眞正的學問不全是從書本上可以得到的。倘若只會讀書，對於生活的實踐毫不注意，結果並不會成爲眞正的學者，只是書蠧而已！書蠧對於社會是没有用的，至多只能在學校課室裏騙一騙無知的學生。　　况且，就是一個眞正的學者，他的知識也絶不會盡善盡美。學問是無際限的，每一個學者的研究所得，不過是在他的生活實踐中掘出來的一小個果實，在茫茫的眞眞理大海中，只能作一滴的貢獻，如果我們想專門依靠學者的著作來作學問，就等於是把自己關在一個狹小的範圍裏，這是很危險的、譬如，資本論在經濟學上，自然是有牠不可殺抹的價值，但在今日的社會上，又有超過資本論所解釋的經濟現象出現了。如果我們僅以得到一知半解的資本論爲滿足。則我們仍絶對不會了解今日的社會。　　因此，我們每個人都要能在自己的生活實踐範圍中去發掘自己所能發現的眞理才行，不能專靠讀書求知識。書本上的知識與我個入的特殊生活多少總是有點隔離的。例如，書本上告訴我們現在社會的出路只是制度的改變，難道我們就能够只管想着制度的改變，而連眼前的吃飯問題都不顧了嗎？其實書本上告訴我們的只是一個大槪的原則，我們切不可只知道原則就算了，還應當把這原則應用到個人的特殊生活中來才行。　　陳君爲生活所逼迫。而不得不忙於眼前的事務，這，我們認爲是正當的，而且是必要的，我們雖然説：（技術不能忘記究極目的）！但這决不是説：爲了究極目的就要抛棄技術，就要連吃飯也不顧。不是，决不是這樣！如果社會上入入都抛棄了飯碗，人人都只是知道究極目的，那還成了什麽樣子呢？我們的意思只是説，個人的生活與整個社會是連繫而不可分的，如果我們單單顧到個人生活而看不見整個社會的歸趨，那即使能敷衍一時，終於是要失敗的。例如在今日除了蘇聨以外幾乎全世界都陷入在經濟恐慌的漩渦裏，在這經濟恐慌的大漩渦裏·小商店小生産者首先要很快的破滅。如果只顧到敷目衍前，而不顧到更大的世界的情勢。我們就會終於要感到没有出路的一天，我們總有一天要陷入悲觀消極之境，若看清了世界大勢，我就明白自己的出路是整個社會的出路，明白了自己的前途，是要依着大衆共同的目的做去，不必因爲個人偶然的失意而悲觀，而消極，甚至於自殺。　　要明白大衆共同的目的，自然多少要讀一點書，但單只明白是不够的。還要在自己的生活實踐範圍中去發現出這共同的目的與個人所生的關係。這不外仍是前面説過的，要能够將讀書所得的應用到實踐上去。不，這樣説還不正確，應該説，要在我們個人的實踐生活中去找到書本上的印證，譬如説，書本上告訴我們世界經濟恐慌現象中是必然不可免的，那末·我們就試看一看自己的周圍罷，是不是一切的事實都能證明這種論呢？我們從實際上看見上海的多少商品都陷入於絶望之境，我們就知道那理論是眞實的。讀書的功用只在於帮助我們更正確地了解自己的生活，我們必須隨時以生活實踐爲基礎，才能得到正確的知識。　　陳君不得不忙於打算盤，念外國語，習字，如果這些是陳君生活上不可缺少的技術，這站在個人生活的立塲上説是應該學習的，我們决不要他抛了這些去研究空洞的書本知識。但同時，我們希望陳君不要在打算盤中單單只看見算盤，還要把算盤聨繫到更普遍的問題上去。我們更希他不要以爲打算盤和讀書在絶對對立不能相容的。如果我想專靠書本來學成一個書蠧，邢當然是與打算盤不能相容的，但問題是在於我們讀書的目的是要求活的知識，即正確的實踐的生活知識，所以我們一面讀書一面就可以回顧到自己的生活上，或者説，一面生活着而一面借讀書來帮助生活的實距踐。　　單只注意（壓在自己頭上的個個的事實）是不行的，但單只注意書本上所指示給我們的原則也仍是空洞得很，我們要能够自動地從自己的生活實踐中去找眞理，要注意分析壓在自己頭上的個個的事實，從個個的事實中去發現更深的意義，而不要被事實的表面所欺瞞，例如買一枝外國公司的香烟，我們覺得那是比較中國製的要便宜的，便如果一加分析，就知道這便宜的烟是代表了外國的經濟侵略，它吸去了中國勞苦民衆的血汗，那價值是比我們在一支烟上所佔的便宜更大的。這一個例子，就告訴我們，微小的個個事實如一支烟這樣的東西裏面，也含有嚴重的深的意味，但如果我們不加以分析，自然被它騙過了。至於個人生活中的個個的事實，是比一支烟更重大的，分析起來，意義更是偉大了。我們並不完全反對人們去注意個個的事實，我們只反對那些只滿足於事實的表面意義而不加以分析的人。　　若要分析自己當前的事實，書本是有帮助的，但也不可拘泥於書本知識，我們要自始至終把書本當做一種帮助者，自始至終以自己的生活實踐爲基礎。在個人的生活中的知識，有時比書本更豐富的，在生活實踐中所求得的學問，才是眞的學問，活的學問。　　最後，説到讀書，是不必要讀得太多的。只要能選擇最切實於自己的生活，最基本的書箱、即能够由很少的書本得到很多的利益。但這是屬於讀書方法的問題，我們已談得很多，以後或許還要談到，但在本題中是不再談了。　　壓在頭土的事實，當然不僅是讀書，關於生活矛盾的其他方面，我們擬在另外一封信中再詳細討論。現在也不説了。</p>

<h3>説明</h3>
<p>吾國教育自十七年以來、已能漸入軌道、有極速之進展、其中尤以中小學爲最、惟發展過速、不無畸重畸輕之處、而教育制度必須應時勢、補偏敉弊、使能時時與國家需要相應、因此現行中小學制度有須重新考慮之點數處、謹列如下、（一）現行中小學制度頗嫌過分側重升學方面、而事實上不能升學之學生反居多數、就十九年教育統計而論、初小九一四五八二二人、高小一三九六七零四人、初中四零一一八人、高中一零六四九一人、是學生能由初小入高小者不過七分之一而强、能由高小入初中者三分之一而弱、能由初中入高中者又僅四分之一、若以小學人數與專科以上學校、（四四零零零人）比較學生能由初小以至大學者二百零七人中僅有一人、爲此一人而使小學成爲中學之預備學校、中學成爲大學之預備學校、未免失當、且不能升學之多數學生、畢業後反因無職業上之預備、或至失業、或學非所用、個人生計、社會事業、兩受損失、此應重行考慮者一也、　　（二）年來農村破産、國本動摇、不獨消極的應速、减除農村之建設、欲謀農村建設、教育上必先養成有知識之新農夫、以爲利用科學方法、增加生産之凖備、但按現行制度、學生由農村而城市、（小學升中學）由城市而省會都會、（中學升大學）畢業後、即不肯再返田間、如此下去、不獨農村無建設之人材、省市亦多浮游之子弟、農村之子弟至城市學習工商業、直接間接固可利潤農村、惟城市容量有限、農村建設需人、教育制度必需兼籌並顧、使農村城市、相倚發展、畸重畸輕、皆有未當、此應重行考慮者二也、　　（三）吾國教育制度與課程、往往抄襲外國、各國情形不同、應就實際社會狀况、釐訂學制、編制課程、始是適應國家之特殊需要、如小學只知注重書本知識、課程過量、甚至有防礙兒童教育者、反之日常生活、爲我國古來之以灑掃應對進退教兒童、養成其作人根本者、反不注意、又如舊時科學之害未除、求學仍以仕進爲目的、故對生活技能、如家庭工業及女子家政等反被鄙棄此、爲吾國特殊心理、必須予以糾正、更如義務教育、倡之有年、至今未能實行、原因雖多、吾國財窮據</p>
<p>民困、師資不足等等、實使吾國義務教育不能爲他國定期六年或至八年者相比、必須酌量國情、另訂辦法、使其登高自卑簡而易行、此應重行考慮者三也、　　（四）以高等教育立塲而論、現行中學制度亦多缺點、高中畢業後、升入大學或專科學校、其基礎知識之訓練、未能適應大學之需要、一方面固因大學本身之不安全、而高中對於國文、外國文、及教學等預備之未充分、亦爲重要原因、往年大學設有預科、此種缺點尚可於二年内補救、現預科旣廢、大學生之來源盡靠中學、故欲大學生求專門知識與技能有充分凖備、須以改革中學課程與訓練爲入手辦法、此應重行考慮者四也、</p>
<h3>提議</h3>
<p>綜合以上各節、謹爲提議如下、（一）就近來統計看、升學者旣爲少數單軌的升學制度、必須加以修正、除就現行制度自成一個系統、專爲少數升學而設者外、對多數學生應有一種制度、在各級中皆有一個段落使各種情形不同之兒童、各能就其能力與經濟狀况、選擇其所宜之學校、務求其畢業後、有相當之良好習慣與生活技能、　　（二）普通觀念以小學中學分段、事實上初小與高小之間、初中與高中之間、更爲重要階級、因由初小升入高小、及由初中升入高中者、反較高小升入初中及高中升入大學者之數目爲低、初小與初中學生、旣多數不能升學、教育必從此處着眼、使此多數不能升學之學生、所受教育、自能成一段落、不但一般小學不應爲升入中學之失備學校、一般中學不應爲升入大學之預備學校、即初小課程、亦不應爲升入高小之預備課程、初中課程亦不應爲升入高中之預備課程、就國民經濟狀况所造成之自、然階段推論將來多數能受教育之國民必爲四年初小畢業或未畢業之學生、四年初小旣爲國民之基礎教育、其課程必求能自成段落、不爲升學而設、書本課程必須减少、生活教育必須加多、注重養成其文字上閲讀及發表能力、公民知識與道德之訓練、在城市者、教以家庭工業及小本商業知識、在鄉村者教以農村家庭工業及農村常識等等、務使其畢業後、成一即不升學而亦能自求生活之公民、　　（三）在上項四年小學畢業後教育即分爲多軌進行其一、爲由現行制度入高小中學以接專科以上之學校（其辦法詳第五條）其二、爲二年之職業學校、（當高小畢業）其三、爲初級職業學校、（當初中畢業）其四、爲高級職業學校（當高中畢業）在職業學校中、必就各地農工業情形、分别予以生産技能之訓練、務求以工作爲主、書本爲輔、使大多數不能升入普通學校之學生、或爲有生産技能之國民故職業學校當以工塲生活爲中心、不當以課堂生活爲中心工塲（或農塲）設備能合實用、教員自己能切實工作和設計後、方可開始招收學生、至目前之有名無實、以書本作職業教材之職業學校、必須嚴格取締、以免妨碍正當職業學校之發展、附註、相當於高小、初中及高中之初·中·高·三級職業學校、共中初級職業學校受納四年小學之畢業生、修業期爲二年、不生問題、中級及高級職業學校之招收學生、可有兩種辦法、第一種辦法、中級職業學校招收初職畢業生、高級職業學校招收中職畢業生、第二種辦法、爲均招四年小學畢業生、而定修業年限爲五年及八年、若依第一種辦法、則三級職業學校爲一貫的、學生升學便利、若依第二種辦法、則五年及八年之職業學校、在前數年可對於爲、職業基礎之學科、有較深之訓練、兩種辦法相較、似以第二法爲宜、各級職業學校之年限、爲適應各種職業之性質及地方情形、似可不必固定　　（四）以上制度所以適應入學兒童之需要、至於失學之兒童、必須即爲設法、施以簡單之義務教育、查學齡兒童約當人口總數百分之十五、（日本大正十四年調查、學齡兒童與人口總數之比例爲百分之十六有奇、江蘇省民十九年調查、學齡兒童與人口總數之比例爲百分之十五、）以此推之、吾國失學兒童當有五千萬兒童、對此五千萬兒童必不可再聽其繼續失學、惟吾國經濟衰落、義務教育爲期不能過長、且大多數失學兒童在於鄉間、必使其半耕半讀、方可推行生效、假設義務教育定爲一年至二年、且利用半日學校在兒童司同時耕讀、在學校亦可容納倍數、或設立冬季學校、俾兒童於農隙時入學、在此一年至二年中、教以單易字課與簡易書報、取材於農業常識、公民常識及家庭衛生等、如此推行數年、先能掃除文盲、以後就國民經濟發展情形、再延長其年限、（附註）三年之義務小學、似可即照教育部所頒布之（短期義務教育實施辦法）辦理、在短期義務小學之上、似可設補習學校、使畢業生於業餘有受補習教育之機會、以補小學訓練之不足、至推行時所需要之多量教員、不必限定師範學生、凡在小學或中學畢業者、分别予以一年至數年之嚴格訓練、授以國家教育政策、公民及農業常識等、畢業後、分送各鄉服務、如此一方面、可以减少失業之學生、一方面、亦可爲鄉村養成多數之教員、　　（五）與高小·初中、高中程度相等之職業學校、旣與入大學之預備學校分離、此種預備學校、（即現行學制、亦應酌量改組、此種學校應招收初小畢業生、合高中三年、初中三年、高小二年、共八年爲度、其課程以求專門知識與技能之凖備爲原則、八年之中、對於國文外國文數學三門、予以繼續不斷的嚴格訓練、務使畢業後、國文則流暢明達、第一外國語則能説能作能談、第二外國語能讀參考書籍、數學則能應用於各種科學、至學校本身應分段設立、或聨續設立、可斟酌各地情形定之、至於嚴格管理、俾養成有規律的習慣、注重體育、俾身心均臻健全、自爲當然之事、（附註）八年之中學、仍可分段、但各段課程爲一貫的、均以凖備受大學教育爲目標、如中學生中途因興趣或家境之變遷、不能深造、則可轉入職業學校在職業學校以内、另謀課程上之補救辦法、若照過去辦法、勉强使中學與職業學校互相溝通、則中學及職業學样課程兩面遷就、必失分别訓練之本旨、中學應否分科問題、亦應考慮、考德法等國、中學均因學科而分組或分校、但其分科、係因注重古代語或現代語而分、非因注重文科或理科而分、如德之（ymnasum係注重古代語有、Real　Gyrnasum則係注重現代語者、而兩校關於文理兩科、均同樣注重、法之中學、Ａ組係注重古代語者、Ｂ組則注重現代語、此外各科課程、均完全相同、中國中學一律不學希臘拉了文、似不生分科之問題、過去以文理分科、似乎有失普通訓練之本旨、　　（六）奬學金、四年小學畢業後、應舉行一種試騐、則其智力及學力可以深造者、分别給以中學或職業學校奬金、此項奬學金、繼續給予至畢業爲止、中學畢業後、應舉行試騐給予奬學金、此項奬學金額數應廣設、使大多數可以造就之中學畢業生、均能完成大學學業、以達到人才教育之止的、一二年義務小學與四年小學之銜接關係、似亦應顧及、一二年義務小學畢業之優秀學生、似亦應用奬學金辦法、助其升入四年小學、俾得逐漸上進之機會、如此辦法、方可不致埋没可造就之人才、</p>
<h3>試騐</h3>

<h3>高中課程時間</h3>
<p>教育與訓練總監兩部連日會商結果、已將高中以上學校學生實施集中軍訓三個月之具體辦法會商就緒、自二十三年度起即行實施、該項辦法因事關軍訓暫不公佈、至因集中軍訓時間、與教部原訂之高中職業師範學校課程時間支配表、顯有抵觸、故教部將原有高中職業師範等校課程時間重行編配後、日内將通令各省市教育廳局轉飭各學校遵照云、教部童軍教練員</p>

<h3>兒童和玩具</h3>
<p>— 杜鵑</p>
<p>在兒童時代的慾望除了食慾外、其次就要算玩具慾了。你瞧！許多男的女的貧的富的以及大的小的兒童，那一個没有他們所心愛的玩具，天天把玩着，像生命般的。</p>
<p>都市裏，玩具的種類和名目眞多得不可勝計；兒童們揀自己喜歡的玩具購買玩耍和收藏。每個家長當他搜查自己子弟的小財産時，至少也能發現數種甚至數十種的玩具像寳物樣的收藏着，這就可見兒童和玩具的關係密切了。</p>
<p>然而小朋友們！你們的玩具是從甚麽地方來的？哼！大半都是洋貨吧。無論小考而夫，彈子，小飛機，不倒翁，橡皮動物………等一類東西。十九都是舶來品；尤其是仇貨居多，無怪本年六個月來游戲玩具的進口統計竟達到五十七萬餘元的驚人記錄！這在民窮財盡的本國裏不能不算是一項鉅額的支出。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們不要專依賴外人的發明而自己儘量的享受。你們又要替整個的中國着想，能否有這樣的購買力？在年青的時代有的是聰明的腦和萬能的手；只要稍費些腦筋和光陰，豈不也照樣的新發明了一件玩具？靠外人怎的！</p>
<h3>（駡人）與（打人）</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>把污辱的言詞加在别人的身上，那就是（駡人。）</p>
<p>把拳足的武力加在别人的身上，那就是（打人。）</p>
<p>駡了人對於自己没有好處；打了人對於自己也没有好處。如果因駡人被人駡，因打人被人打，那就不但没有益處，反而遭受損失了！</p>
<p>孔子家兒不知駡，曾子家兒不知怒，這都是值得我們效法的。</p>
<p>假使别人有過錯，我們可以規勸；假使别人對於我們要施行打駡，我們可以忍讓；這樣就可以使對方自己知慚而退，免去許多無謂的煩惱。</p>
<p>我不是在提倡（學吃虧），我却是在敬告一般小朋友們要多養點和愛的精神，多做點實際的工作；要知道那般歡喜駡人的就是自駡！歡喜打人的就是自打！</p>
<p>小朋友喲：從今天起，我們把打駡的時間，都來用在學業上吧。</p>

<p>大西瓜，水上飄，有人不識其中妙，秤瓜質量，計重多少，比（同體積水）輕了，這呌做比重，要知道記牢。</p>

<h3>明天</h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>（爸爸，現在是呌明天嗎？）敏兒跳跳躍躍的走到房間裏對他父親這樣説。</p>
<p>（不是的，我的孩子。）父親微笑説：（現在不可以呌明天的。）</p>
<p>（你爲了什麽想到現在就呌明天呢？敏兒。）父親温和的問。</p>
<p>（是啊，爸爸，你不是昨天説：明天是星期日，兒童週刊又要出版了，今天恰是星期日，兒童週刊也出版了，所以現在一定呌明天。）敏兒説。</p>
<p>他的父親又微笑起來，説道；（現在是昨日的明天，但是現在我們必須呌今天。譬如：現在可以説明天是星期一，可是星期一到了，我們又須説明天是星期二。）</p>
<p>後來，敏兒想了又想，説道：（這樣，那末明天是永遠不會來的。）</p>
<h3>眼睛騙人</h3>
<p>— 任潮軍</p>
<p>這個題目在小朋友看來不是很奇怪嗎？眼睛會騙人？小朋友一定不相信，以爲無論甚麽東西，眼睛看過是怎樣便是怎樣，但是却不對。</p>
<p>太陽是甚麽顔色？小朋友一定説是白的，但是不對，我們却受了眼睛的騙，太陽有顔色的，它由紅·橙·黄·綠·青·藍·紫等七色組成，因爲太陽在空中旋轉得很快，所以成了白色，倘使小朋友不信，可把鏡子向着太陽，把反射的光映在牆上，便有一條美麗的五彩光，仔細去看，便有這七種顔色，倘使把這七種顔色，支配均匀，貼在一個能摇旋轉的圓盤上，用力的摇，便會變成白色。</p>
<p>在這張圖上，更顯出眼睛會騙人，圖一，甲和乙好做二根綫，但是却是一根。二，似乎乙形大於甲形，倘使量一量却相等。三，甲乙和乙丙相等，看去甲乙大於乙丙。四，六·好像甲都比乙小，事實却相等。五，是一個正方形，但畫幾條弧似乎扁了。</p>
<p>在上面看來，眼睛不是不可靠嗎？小朋友，你們不論看什麽東西，須要考慮，不要太信了眼睛。（見附圖）</p>
<h3>頑皮的王兒</h3>
<p>— 景元</p>
<p>１王兒的爸爸在修理無綫電機，２爲什麽不把它插進去？３且來試試看吧！４啊喲！你這小猪玀？</p>
<h3>一個夏天的晚上</h3>
<p>— 玲</p>
<p>火一般的太陽，從水平綫上，漸漸的跌下去了。那皎潔的月和閃爍的星，在天空中發出明亮的光來；地面上的人類，都吃完了他們的晚餐，在星月之下高談闊論了。</p>
<p>我一人坐在楊柳樹下的青石上，冷靜得很，便看看在天空中發出亮光的星月。只聽見河水流動的聲音，和凉風吹動樹葉的聲音，再有青蛙和少數蟲兒的呌聲，如此以外，就不聽見什麽了！我在這寂寞的空氣中，想着那二三年没有見面的同學，伊的面貌，伊的行動和其他的一切，在我腦中一一的旋轉着。在分别的時候，伊對我説的話，我至今也没有忘記。在校中受伊種種的幫助，如果我不懂的功課，伊終是盡心盡力的講着，使我懂了，伊才放心得下。在下課的時候，伊和我常在一塊很小的草地上玩着遊戲，没有一刻分離的。但是到現在，却連信也没有寄來，不知伊仍在那個校裏讀書嗎？不知伊現在可是已搬了家嗎？總想找一個機會，能知道伊的一切。我正在這樣胡思亂想的，忽然覺得有人拍拍我的肩背，原來妹妹呌我進房睡覺去了。</p>
<h3>幾個有趣的算題</h3>
<p>— 超</p>
<p>小朋友！你們或者要不相信連算術題目都會有趣吧！不是嗎？課程中最使人討厭的，便是算術這一門，旣乏味而又難弄，做得不好，分數便會不及格，有時竟累得升級都發生了問題。我想，小朋友們一定都厭惡着它，爲了要免去小朋友和算術中間的惡感，所以寫出了下面幾個有趣的算題：</p>
<p>第一問，好像是除法，題目很簡單，説是有布十尺，假定每天剪去一尺，問幾天才可剪完？小朋友看了，一定會答十天才剪完，因爲以一除十，答數仍舊是十啊！但是錯了，答案却不是十而是九，倘使是十，便也没有什麽趣味可説了；這當然得解釋明白，小朋友試想，十尺的布，剪到第八天，便只剩兩尺了，第九天一刀剪下，便成了兩個一尺，無用第十天再去剪了，這不是只須九天就够了麽？</p>
<p>第二題，假定説樹上有十隻鴉，給獵人用槍打落了一隻，問樹上還有幾隻？小朋友定會很有把握的喊起來説，還有九隻，十减去了一不是九嗎？然而欲又錯了，因爲槍聲一起，其餘的不都要飛去了嗎？所以正確的答案應當是零。</p>
<p>第三題同樣很簡單，説在十丈長的路中，每隔一丈，種樹一棵問共需種樹幾棵？這更容易了，路長十丈當然只能種十棵樹，小朋友定也這麽想，但是，仍舊不對，郤出於意料之外的可以種十一棵呢！因爲路的頭和末，都得種樹一棵，再加中間九棵，不是成了十一棵嗎？</p>
<p>上面三個題目，小朋友看了，大槪也覺到有趣吧！因爲答案很出乎意料之外，而又這麽合理。所以我勸諸位小朋友，不要仇視了臬術，它原也有着趣味呢！</p>
<h3>泥人和蠟人爭做哥哥</h3>
<p>— 菊高</p>
<p>小泥人，小蠟人，不分長短和肥瘦，本是一對好朋友，因爲都想做哥哥，嚕嚕囌囌不住口。</p>
<p>小泥人説：（我的身體十分重，大風吹來不摇動；你的質地太輕鬆，一交跌倒嘴巴腫。你的本領不及我，應該讓我做哥哥。）</p>
<p>小蠟人説：（我雖身輕會游泳，飄浮水中興趣濃；你的身體太笨重，雨打水浸就不中用。你的本領不及我，還是讓我做哥哥。）</p>
<p>小泥人説：（主人愛我不愛你，因爲你，同他一起睡，一覺醒來，便要壓斷手和腿。你的本領不及我，爭做哥哥不應該。）</p>
<p>小蠟人説：（主人愛我不愛你，因爲我，身上繫個輕氣球，馬上到天空，摘下幾顆明星來。你的本領不及我，爭做哥哥也不該。）</p>
<p>小主人，正把剪貼做，聽得它們話嚕囌，連忙過來勸勸和：（年紀小，做弟弟，年紀大，做哥哥，你們説不出歲數，誰也不能做哥哥。）</p>
<p>小泥人和小蠟人，聽了生公平話，大家低着頭，閉着口，含着羞，拉着手，依舊是一對好朋友。</p>
<h3>有趣的紀錄</h3>
<p>— 陶然</p>
<p>在我們個世界裏，同樣是一種動物，同樣是一個生命，然而壽命的長短，却是相差得很遠呢。我們來整理誴些動物的不同壽命的紀錄，覺得是很感着興趣的。</p>
<p>世界上動物中壽命最長的，要算是龜了。龜的年齡至少在二百年至三百年，再壽高點有五百年的。要是拿龜的年齡來和蜉蝣的壽命相比，那末眞不知相差了幾千萬倍哩！</p>
<p>蜉蝣的壽命，是動物中最短命的、從出生到入死，前後不過五個小時。</p>
<p>蟬的壽命，從兩天到四十天，普通在三十天左右。也算得是短命的動物。</p>
<p>在長壽命的動物中，蛟，有二百五十年，鯉魚有二百年，都是次於龜的年齡。</p>
<p>（人壽百年），這還是古人的壽命呢。</p>
<p>現在一般人的壽命，平均總在五六十歲左右。比起古人來，已减短了許多了。</p>
<p>鶴和鴕鳥，都能活到五六十年，和人的壽命差不多長。</p>
<p>在鳥類中最長壽的，就該輪到鸚鵡。鸚鵡的壽命中最長壽的，就該輪到鸚鵡。也有一百五十年。再其次就是鳶，也有一百年的壽年。這些都比人的壽命長得多了。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>▲炎熱下的農友</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>烈火也似的太陽，曬得田中赤膊露腿的農友們背上的汗直流下來。老黄牛喘着氣，在車篷裏打水，農友也戴着箬帽戽水；可憐他們用盡了氣力，經不起陽光的蒸曬；河裏乾得可以行走了。於是他們巴望着雲霓，雨露。老天好像故意爲難，偏偏没有下雨的意味；那些禾苗，都漸漸地枯了。農友們嘆着氣。焦急着！</p>
<p>當着萬衆一心希求雨的降臨的時候，農友們築了幾十丈的泥龍，焚香禮拜。小兒女們，裸着全身，塗上了泥，裝作水鬼，手裏拿了柳枝，各處亂跑；這樣，以爲（雨）就要沛然而下了。我們知道這是迷信的舉動，但，你們也可想像農村亢旱的一般了。</p>
<p>到了夜晚，因爲大地熱力反吐射出來，於是終日辛辛苦苦的農友們，不能安枕：大家在樹下塲前乘着風凉，講講故事，説説種田的道理。有時當很熱的夜裏，閉眼的機會也没有，還要被蚊子吸吮身上的血；天色乳白，又揹着農具到田間去了。啊！辛勤可憐的農民們！</p>
<p>小小工藝</p>
<h3>怎樣製造一個活動人？</h3>
<p>— 萬湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，活動人的製造法，很容易，很簡單，約費一小時多些的時間。而趣味却極大，這裏的圖解和説明是非常詳細，你可仔細的瞧着做吧。</p>
<p>説明：取一塊硬的紙板，用鉛筆畫成人的上形和四肢（圖一）。然後用剪刀沿綫剪去，把人的上體和四肢分開了截下來；再用錐子依（圖二）的黑點錐小孔拿銅絲把下肢連接起來，不可太緊，要活動的。將短銅絲接繫好那上肢的拳孔，看（圖三）。而上下兩端須反方向。否則，便不容易活動啦！進一步用細竹一根削圓，一端近頭，削成溝形；另一端可做成槍狀，（圖四）。更進一步，可用短銅絲，縛在槍的溝底，一端穿進右手拳孔，另一端入右手拳孔，須要活動。參看（圖五），最後用銅絲彎成（？－）形，穿進右手肩孔及肩胛孔從左肩胛孔出來，仍如前扭彎。銅絲要活動得很靈巧，這時，你可再用銅絲接連肩孔的銅絲，而復穿進筆套管的一端，使它堅固，便可玩了。（圖六）</p>
<p>（附白）玩時須執握筆套管的一頭，旋轉起來，只見紙人舞動長槍，身手靈活，彷彿是一員大將哩。</p>
<p>如果用五彩顔色來塗一下，那更好看了。</p>

<p>婦女園地</p>
<h3>論（艷裝與婦女）</h3>
<p>— 伊凡</p>
<p>在八月十二日的本刊，看到玄君的（艷裝與婦女）。把這類問題提出討論，當然不會反對；但是關於玄君這篇文章的結論，實在有再加討論的必要。</p>
<p>責備艷裝的婦女，在這樣個時代中不爲社會做些有益的事業，倒忙着打扮得妖妖艷艷，去誘惑異性；這樣的責備我也覺是極對的。玄君其次就將婦女艷裝的動機與來由，歸之於婦女社會之惡劣，（因其是商品，不得不裝煌點綴，以求銷售。）我認這樣説有部分的正確。到後他寫到該文主要的部分，他説：（根本的辦法，還是應使女子個個有平等獨立的地位，不必藉肉體來換得生活資料，在這原則下，第一社會不該再有奴化的教育，第二應使女了能有眞正獨立的環境。一。這叚結論粗看像是可以成立，但把它再研究一下，就無法不感到那樣的理論過分懸空；再則也太不留婦女的地位了。</p>
<p>玄君要求（社會），不該再有奴化教育，應使女子有眞正獨立環境，這（社會）是代表的誰？很有點含糊。如果所代表是眼前這百孔千瘡的舊社會，儘你向它喊，向它要求，向它大聲嚷，它不會理睬你：因爲所有你指出的錯誤，都是它的精心傑構，祇要它自己的壽命能延長到多久、這種錯誤它當然要維護到多久。如果這些要求的對象是未來的新社會，則我們應該想到那個社會還不曾誕生，不能向空裏喊它做這做那，不能簡單的向它喊出我們的要求。因爲使它産生的就是我們自己，代表它的也是我們自己，問題僅是我們將用那一種努力來實現我們自己的要求而已。</p>
<p>回過去再論到艷裝的婦女，其實眞正够得上稱艷裝婦的，也僅屬極少數的都市婦女，大部分的勞動婦女大衆、雖處在同樣惡劣的社會地位上，但她們並不在做（洋奴），並不在做（外國貨推銷員），不僅她們没有那種把自己打扮得妖異的欲望，卽有，她們的時間精力也不許她們那樣做的。生活淫佚的都市婦女，她們不工作，她們有大量的時間。精神，財力，可以任情揮霍；而與她們共同生活的有閒的男子們，又在暗示或鼓勵她們打扮得妖艷新奇，以適合那種放蕩生活，所以在大都市中，我們能發現那麽多艷裝的婦女，不事生産，藉妖冶的肉體以維治生活的人。（我們不必給她們分出誰是娼妓，誰是良家婦女，在社會生産與消費的情形上講，她們是毫無不同的。）</p>
<p>如果我們覺到這種專門講究艷裝的婦女是在丢醜，是我們大家的損失，根本的解决，祇有由我們大家的努力，去消滅人類中生活特殊優異的階級，去消滅專消費而不生産的寄生階級。必須如此，才是（根本的解决）。否則，我們大可上個呈文請政府制止婦女艷裝，不也算得一種消極的辦法嗎？</p>
<h3>自我批判與批判認識</h3>
<p>— 碧遥</p>
<p>有人以爲男子也屈服於女子的，譬如説：（拜倒柘榴裙下），（爲美人執鞭）之類。但説這話的人一定是千度以上的近視眼睛，要給他解辯也無從解辯。</p>
<p>女子始終没有脱離男子的壓迫，卽使做得到許多男人跪在她的脚下，或是許多男人請命爲她執鞭，也不過是爲了她的眼睛呀，小口呀，嫩腿呀，……而不是爲了别的；他們同樣跪在於男人面前時，則是爲了他的權勢，偉大，和其他。然則女子就畫黑了眼框，點紅了嘴唇，油光的腿皮，以博得成羣的男子的拜倒，又算甚麽出息？</p>
<p>女子没出息的舉動多着：奇裝艷服，染手染脚，過分的修飾，浪漫而輕佻是一端；求學不努力，做事不認眞，一心想漁獵一位富有標緻的男兒而嫁之，以結婚爲唯一的出路，唯一的事業的又是一端；故步自封，淺薄孤陋，以無聊當眞理，頑梗不化，阻礙進化的是一端；羣居終日，言不及義，道長論短，不知人生社會民族國家爲何物，以虚送一生的又是一端；歌舞賭博，浪費逍遥，連治家育兒的事務都不聞間的又是一端；…凡此種種，都是今日知識婦女，自甘墮落於狐狸猪狗的痛心的現象。要想婦女脱離非人的境界，知識婦女，是應有嚴正的自我批判！</p>
<p>再則近來關於婦女的（嚕囌）多着，遠的像西歌的德國且不必論；單看我們自己國内，對婦女如臨不祥的大敵；禁止男女同車，禁止男女同食，禁止男女同住，禁止婦女赤足裸腿，……如社會可能全然帳幕後都少了她們的話，簡直可以使她們盡數化爲砲灰，以正人心。同時各報喧騰：今年的幾個月中，脂粉香水進口若干萬，花邊進口若干萬，眞假首飾進口若干萬。彷彿她們這批傷風敗俗的妖物，又是國家經濟破産的泉源。</p>
<p>不錯，這批洋貨裝身，染手染脚的妖物，確是傷風敗俗，國家經濟破産的泉源中的一部。可是我們在十幾億元的進口物中，除了大宗的軍用品不論而外，有没有喧騰過巴拿馬草帽進口若干萬；呂宋雪茄進口若干萬，巴黎斯特康進口若干萬？没有！這些非由婦女造下的孽，没有誰給牠宣傳。</p>
<p>從此我們（婦女）應切實認清這是個甚麽年頭！這年頭我們應如何的步步警戒！外來的批判，可以由詆譭婦女的奇裝艷服，浪漫逍遥，進而主張婦女應返於家庭，返於無才便是德，返於内言不出於閫，甚至於不許抛頭露面，臉上掛了黑布，和回教國的女人似的，活活地做蒙頭母猪。</p>
<p>秋氣是隨處肅殺，可是堅實的松柏，仍能傲然無傷；道年頭固然是我們的災厄，我們如果能好好地檢束，好好地進條，未始不能多有些力量奮鬥以自存。</p>
<p>舊式的，無知的婦女，壓根兒不能希望她爲平等，自由，而略略抬頭；千斤的婦女解放的重担，就在我們少數的知識婦女的肩上。我們就讓自己内部這般腐化，再加上外來層層的壓力，而自己首尾埀埀，甘於走入猪欄牛欄以内作牲畜嗎？</p>
<h3>升學問題</h3>
<p>— 君憑</p>
<p>中國是有名的文盲國家，照一般的統計看來，文盲數目占百分之八十至九十，若單就婦女統計，恐怕要占百分之百吧！在這大多數的婦女不但不能求學，而且連飯也没得吃的今日，我們來談這僅少數的婦女升學問題，似乎是舍本逐末，但在婦女的啟蒙意義上，牠還不失爲一個值得討論的社會問題。</p>
<p>我們談這問題的動機，固然要給與一般青年在升學期中必須凖備的一些知識，但這還是不够的，我們須進一步討論升學者對升學這一事實的認識問題。就是説，我們不單討論如何升學，並且討論爲什麽要升學。關於前者，在前期英君的論文中已經説過，可不必再説，在這兒，祇談到後者。</p>
<p>關於爲什麽要升學的問題，我想，每個凖備升學的婦女却必須深刻的認識！這一認識不單左右學校及學科目的選擇，同時影響於升學者的整個生活前途，假使毫無認識的祗爲升學而升學，那簡直是瞎走，結果會碰鼻子的，可是，對於升學的認識也就是對於社會的認識，因爲社會關係已决定升學這一事實而不許升學者要怎樣便怎樣，因此，升學者須先容觀的去認識現實的社會事實，然後確定自身的升學目的。</p>
<p>在中國現社會中，婦女升學的目的，大部分是要得到較高的知識與技能，賴以獲得經濟上的獨立而不依賴男子，這原是婦女界自覺的表現。但事實却不完全這樣，自從五四運動以來，隨着整個社會關係的變革，求學的婦女日見增多，直至今日，中學及大學畢業的婦女也很不少，但其中能够在社會上獨立謀生者果有幾個！除了僅少數當了中小學教員及其他低級職業者外，大多數便是當太太或姨太太去了！單就女教員而論，在男權支配的時代，男教員的地位常比女教員優越；較好的位置先給男教員占了去，結果女子只能在最低級的學校裏服務，至其待遇的苛酷則更不消説，無論任何職業，女子要用男子競爭，簡直是不可能的事。這原因决非單純的基於女子知識水凖的低下，主要的還是婦女在社會上仍處於隸屬地位的原故。</p>
<p>尤其，在目前農村破産，都市恐慌而整個社會動盪不定的時候，慢説女子找不到出路，即大多數戴着學士頭銜的男子們也着實陷於失業恐慌。最近北平的所謂求職同盟便是一個有趣的實例。這種現象在社會没有根本的變革以前，不單不會停止，反而更加緊的進展，是可以斷言的！假使说升學的目的僅在獲得較好的職業，那末，這些擺在眼前的事實，會給你一個否定的答覆！</p>
<p>在這樣的情形底下，知識婦女的没有出路是再明顯没有的了，於是乎她們唯一的出路便是自身的商品化，在一切都是商品化的現在社會下，女子的商品化原極平常，不足奇怪，出賣勞力的男子，又何嘗不是一種商品！可是，知識婦女的商品化，實有其特殊的意義，她們旣不能在社會上出賣其知識技能，又不願像女工一樣的出賣其勞動力，結果，只有在商品化的自身上更加修飾，以期得到吏好的買主！這樣一來，塗脂抹粉，穿得花花綠綠固然有裝飾商品的意義、而讀書升學也未嘗不有裝飾商品以增高其價值的意義！誰敢説畢業證書不就是招來顧客的廣告呢！正在凖備升學的青年婦女們對於這種現象必須加以深刻的認識與批判，更進而努力糾正那種自甘墮落的頺廢傾向！</p>
<p>總而言之，婦女之無出路以至於甘心墮落，與其説是由於女子本身的無能力，毋寗説是由於社會的原因更來得正確。因此，婦女問題的根本解决，必須等到整個新社會問題的解决，可是，每個婦女對其所處地位的自覺與及對舊勢力的不斷鬥爭也未嘗不是解放婦女的必要條件，現代中國的知識婦女假如無此種自覺與鬥爭决心，則雖升學而至於出洋留學，戴了博士帽歸來也不過多了幾個更能消費的活商品而已，對於社會是毫無益處的！</p>
<h3>談男女之防</h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>（復古）如果與人類社會眞正有益，我想並不會有人（醉新）的，近日報紙宣傳，關於男女之防，又漸漸嚴起來了，這大槪是由於（人心（尤其是女人）不古）的反響，古了，可就是好嗎？這也未必，詩三百篇，總算古籍了，可是（詩經）中，描寫戀愛問題的就有不少，如：（…有女懷春，吉干誘之），（舒而脱脱兮，無感伐帨兮，無使龐也吠！）的情形，恐怕現在接受（歐風美雨）而（醉新）的青年，還做不到這樣精采吧！可見男女變愛，古已有之，熱心（復古）的人，並不很知道（古）是怎麽説法？難道産生（詩經）的社會，其時人心已經不古了麽？再向上溯，再向上溯去，怕是人們（只知有母而不知有父）！性交旣亂且雜了！可見孔子之（吾未見好德如好色者也）的慨嘆，也就呌做没有辦法，孟子所説：（知好也，則慕少艾！）是自古已然，告子提出來，孟子承認的那句：（食色性也！）的確很有些道理，</p>
<p>把（詩經）撇開，再就（民歌）來研究一下：</p>
<p>（我十七十八正要偷，那怕爹娘綑勒脚跟頭？大麥上塲榖張打，韮菜逢春匡割頭！（江陰）劉半農著瓦釜集。</p>
<p>（行不安來坐不安，時時掛念妹心肝，三隻銅錢買張紙，畫妹顔容牀上看。）（廣東）民間情歌集。</p>
<p>這些民歌，全國各處都有，不過大同小異，産生於何時，無從考據，大槪没有（歐風美雨）的影響，很可斷言：因爲唱這些歌的人多是村姑娘和放牛小子或是農夫農婦們，都没念過洋八股，（工人也唱，那是從鄉下帶來的）這可見無論智愚賢不肖，（未免有情），並非是受了洋鬼子迷惑的！而所謂（防），也就白費心血，至多不過把（同車）（同行）（同桌）同什麽的，回復到（驚艷）（跳牆）（眉語）（目成）弄得男女不見面則已，一見面便會面紅耳熱，心頭亂跳有了機會便餓虎撲食似的（眞眞豈有此理）地亂幹起來，這一類事，古今往來，實在是數不勝數的，比較現在之所謂（戀愛）彬彬有禮的（見面）（通信）以至（同行）（同車）（同吃）（同坐）……請問到底那樣好一些呢？</p>
<p>總之：男女兩性的相親相愛，依理是和水之向下的一樣出於自然；只有善爲引導，使之不走入歧途，才是根本的辦法。若單用防閒來治，不等於築長堤治黄河一樣，費盡了數千年的財力，還不仍舊時時决口汛濫的嗎？</p>
<h3>上海慈幼托兒所訪問記</h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>是個天氣熱得怪厲害的下午。</p>
<p>在楊樹浦路上，我全個身子沐着汗，東問西問地，好容易才找到了這勞工們寄托兒童的地方——上海慈幼托兒所。</p>
<p>房子是兩上兩下靠馬路的。</p>
<p>走進了右邊的一扇矮門，就是教室，十來張低桌，齊整地排列着，四週的牆上，稀稀地點綴着幾幅畫和幾張統計圖表。設備雖不能説十分完全，但够得上説聲（簡潔）。這時樓梯邊出現了兩位狠和靄的女士，隨着，我聲述了來意以後，承她倆誠意的招待，導我上了樓。</p>
<p>亭子間，是闢作職員寢室和孩子洗臉用的，數十塊小毛巾和數十個漱口杯，排號樣地掛着。前樓，展開着一個簡單的兒童樂園。墻上貼滿了五色的揷畫，櫉窗裏也陳列着不少兒童的恩物。活潑可愛的孩子，都嘻嘻地向我打招呼，呌（先生），這情景，過後眞怪難過的，因爲它，使我憶起了我自己的己逝去了的幼年。</p>
<p>一陣寒喧後，坐定了，我就向一位姓王的女士，打開了預先帶來的話匣，下面的就是記者與該所保姆王女士的對話。</p>
<p>（請王先生告訴我些貴所的大槪情形。）</p>
<p>（敝所是由中華慈幼會主辦的，現在已經三年啦，每月的經費是三百元，房子由隔壁滬東公社供給，不出錢的。至行政組織，也很簡單，除了一個主任外，就只我和蜜司何兩個教員。收容的兒童，現在一共有五十個。年齡最小是三歲，最大七歲，平均是四五歲光景。</p>
<p>（每人每月收費好多呢？）</p>
<p>（因爲我們原來就帶些慈善性的，所以收費很便宜，五毛錢一個月，還得供他們一頓中膳和點心哩！不過，如果是商人的子弟，却不能享此權利，照規定，得收五塊錢。）</p>
<p>（現有的兒童家屬，是什麽職業的多？）</p>
<p>都是蛋廠和紗廠工人，因爲每個孩子進來時，我們都得詳細調查，所以，他們是欺騙不了我們的。）</p>
<p>（貴所開放的時間是幾點到幾點？有假期嗎？）我又這麽問。</p>
<p>（開放的時間，是早上七點起至下午五六點，星期是休息的，暑假可没有，寒假呢，也得跟工人休息與否而定，大槪每年可放兩個禮拜</p>
<p>（保育方面呢？）</p>
<p>（我們把全所的兒童分兩級，上午全在樓下上智識課。十二時半睡午覺後就改在此地或者隔壁滬東公社的操塲，上游戲課。）</p>
<p>（對於衛生方面怎樣呢？）</p>
<p>（衛生方面，因限於經濟的關係，設備很簡陋，通常，我們除了每天的例行工作，如洗臉漱口等以外，規定星期一，四兩日，各給孩子們洗澡一次。）</p>
<p>（這樣，你們兩位不是太辛苦了嗎？）我這麽説。王女士和那位在忙於照料孩子的何女士，都笑了。</p>
<p>（前次在申報上，有人主張在現時代的中國，還不需要托兒所與兒童公育，這意見，敢問兩位女士以爲怎樣？）</p>
<p>（啊！這些理論太高深了，我們怎能懂得呢？）她倆不約而同地回答。但接着，王女士却説了，（不過，依我想，事實是最大的雄辯，×先生，你過來瞧吧！）於是，我跟着站起了身，走到了一個孩子的面前，那孩子，怕還只有四歲光景吧。</p>
<p>（這孩子是怪可憐的，他的爸和媽，跟别的孩子一樣，都是工人，白天一早就得上工廠做工，有誰再來照顧他呢？瞧！這就是給電車軋壞的！王女士説到這裏，把孩子的頭髮輕輕地撥！撥啊！那裏，半尺長的傷痕，紫色的血塊還凝結着，（在十天之前吧！）王女又繼續説了（他的父母打聽到了這兒有個托兒所，才把他送來的。要是上海早普遍地有了托兒所的設置，孩子怎會無辜地受這些災難呢？）</p>
<p>我慶幸這無辜受傷的兒童，得進了幸福的樂園外，更替中國無數的可憐的兒童祈求，隨着即速有完備的托兒所的設立，這不僅是慈善機關的任務，希望熱心社會事業的人士，多多的提倡和贊助。</p>
<h3>信（續）</h3>
<p>— 白薇</p>
<p>更有，表面是金菩薩的扮裝，嘴裏是鴉片烟的臭味，一副鉛色可怕的乾枯面孔，帶着疲倦欲死的無神眼光，聳起骷髏似的肩頭伸不直腰，半咯半喘地透不過氣。這種鬼氣濃厚的幽靈，對於國民經濟的虚耗，對於遺嗣的流毒，是給民族社會怎樣恶毒的影響呢？你們也曾想到，要對她們大聲呼喝：（幽靈們，趕快躱進墳墓去吧！不然，就實行彈丸的掃射呀！）嗎？</p>
<p>相反地，勞動婦女的終年辛勤不得温飽，或因勞苦過度而猛烈的衰弱，速度的衰老，或因産前産後的失調與工作的鞭迫，而致病殞身；或因一旦不愼而傷身斷手失業，陷於慘淡無邊的生涯……她們這種悲慘的生活，你們好還像不敢正視；一班渣滓般窮困的女人底陰慘，苦痛，飢餓，過着奴隸不如野狗不如的生活，你們也彷彿不曾正視；内地婦女的無知，固陋，還過着地獄般重重壓迫的生活，你們也曾想要使她們怎樣覺悟，得到解放麽？</p>
<p>這兩極端的一切奇形怪象；一面表現了半殖民地經濟的不平衡，女權又低落，都市的婦女，正高度地墮落着；一面表現了半殖民地重重壓迫下的無知婦女，牛馬不如地在扎挣喘着。</p>
<p>這種怪象越深化，演進，中國只有亡國，滅種。不亡國滅種，那倒是恥辱！</p>
<p>爲甚麽中國女子，會墮落悲慘到這步田地？原因在那裏？</p>
<p>我們不　那原因是社會的，經濟的，制度的，政治的，抑或女性甘自墮落的，　而言之，我們是半殖民地的人民所受的苦痛，甚於亡國奴的今日，我們覺悟的女子，尤其是你，掌握着女界言論的權威的你，對於這種尖端的怪象作何感想？能够坐視這尖端惡毒，悲慘，愈加深化演進嗎？</p>
<p>我們是不是要找出它底因果，加以有力的秤擊討論？我們是不是要對着那壓迫的重幕；丢一把光明的火種，讓壞的死滅去，讓好的生長來？是不是必須用我們女子底素手，合力齊心，火急地去拯救那整千整萬被壓迫的沉淪的女人，使她們澈底地得到解放？</p>
<p>若然，那你是想説的没有説呵！</p>
<p>你們没有把尖端的怪象，深刻地反映出來，針對着毒惡的深淵，加以掃射的彈火；你們也絶少用鎂光的明亮，引出陷人深淵的女子，教她們飛向眞正自由之天。</p>
<p>誠然，你是很努力了，你對過去的不滿不斷地攻擊，爲現在的婦女謀福利的地方也不少。可是你對於目前尖端的怪象，惡習，對於呌婦女回到家庭去這些，太没有注意了。</p>
<p>也許是（婦女要回到家庭去！）這年頭兒，你們只能够説那些吧？但是，我們正要對着一婦女要回到家庭去！）這句惡魔的口號，作澈底的反抗，誓死鬥爭！我們要大家努力做反對這口號的工作而不投降？</p>
<p>我們不但要反對（婦女要回到家庭去！）我們還得高唱：（婦女要深入社會去！）我們不但要跑出家庭，挣脱當前種種的鐵鍊，我們還得勇敢地爭取政治經濟的地位與男子平等，和男子一樣地幹一切去！我們不但要洗除婦女尖端的惡習，堅决地謀婦女的解放，自由，我們還得用我們底情，血，愛，替男子洗除一切的罪惡，恊力地謀民族的解成，自由！</p>
<p>九一八的炮聲暴露了日本要滅亡中國以來，日本的女權有飛躍日上之勢，職業增高到女子練習軍事，駕駛飛機了。而被滅亡的中國，却要女子回到家庭去，近來南方各機關，已經實行截去女職員，禁令男女同學，同遊，同走……使幾年來在開倒車的女權，更沉没到地獄去！那種壓迫婦女的見解，眞使關心民族存亡者所百思不解！</p>
<p>女子不得到澈底解放自由，社會是不會進步的！以不進步的中國，而想在敵人力俎下喘喘着生存，一面唱道：（婦女要回到家庭去！）那簡直是病入膏盲者發熱的囈語！</p>
<p>起來吧，被壓迫的姊妹們！我們再不是聽從惡魔的指使，再不是屈服在糊塗混沌的男子面前的時候了！我們再不能徒恃依人爲生的嬌艷，色相，而放棄爭取自己底經濟獨立權了！我們再不是專門講究裝飾，製成没有靈魂的金粉菩薩，靠着出賣肉體，毁滅人椿的勾當來苟活的時候了！我們也不能在這經濟恐慌，百業衰落的社會裏，任人榨取，任人剝削而不自覺了</p>
<p>我們要在堅决苦鬥中求生存，要曉得依賴男人爲生，是怎樣的恥辱；我們要在自由解放的旗幟下爭取勝利，把脚踏進社會的深層去，伸到國境的邊界去，伸出世界去！我們一面要毅然地從過去的習俗制度和男子底手裏，把自己解放出來，一面要熱誠地把同輩和下一輩的多罪軟弱的男子救起。使大家脱離壓迫享自由！</p>
<p>我們要用自家高價的情，血，愛，灌溉自由之花喲！我們要用畢生的力去幹！</p>
<p>茲九，你不以我胡説一大堆，是發了瘋麽？你不以婦女園地那很少的篇幅，是不能容納許多意見不能盡量説話麽？我底意思是——希望你革新婦女園地之外，再爲婦女　塊多爭取些篇幅，給熱心解放婦女的女士先生們，得盡量發表意見。更希望你　着局　　筆省及熱心這問題的人，商量的創辦一種規　較大的婦女刊物，打起婦女解放的旗，打起精神去　！使中國女界，都在　圍心血緒　的旗幟下，到得解放，自由　　祝撰安！</p>

<h3>奥大利問題</h3>
<p>— 林子</p>
<p>戰後的奥大利雖僅是一個約有六百萬人口的小國，但其在歐洲却佔着非常重要的地位。維也納政府的一切重要的措施與夫這大都市裏所發生的許多事變，不僅與法德意等列强在中歐的利害衝突發生直接關係，卽對整個歐洲乃至世界和平都有極大的影響。所謂奥大利問題，實是戰後發生的極複雜極嚴重而不易解决的問題之一。</p>
<p>首先看法德意三國在奥大利問題上的根本矛盾吧。</p>
<p>在奥大利的對外貿易中，德國要估第一位；同時，意大利的對外貿易朝向多瑙河國家者，亦佔百分之十的數目字，在經濟上奥國與之也有極大的關係；至於法國，則其對奥國的財政尤有很大的壓力，據德報所載，從一九一九年起到一九三二年止法國借與奥大利的欵（單指國家借欵）就有三萬二千六百萬佛郎之多，短期的信用借欵還不在内。——由此當可想見在一個小小的奥大利中，在經濟上法德意三國會要發生怎樣的矛盾。</p>
<p>同時，德國爲要爭霸中歐，問事巴爾幹，向東南邁進，便不得不努力於德奥合併的活動。但巴爾幹半島是法人所認爲的私産，奥匃亦爲其侵略範圍，德國的活動，法蘭西當然是不能坐視的。所以，在解决奥大利問題上，巴黎曾提出了建立包括奥匃與小恊約國的多瑙河聨邦，其意不僅是要截斷德國東進的道路，而有還想封鎖意大利於亞德里亞海内，以獨霸中歐。意國呢？當然也是很聰明的。牠不僅反對法國之欲建立多瑙河聨邦，卽對德奥合併也表示很不高興，（雖然在反凡爾賽體制上意德是一致的）因爲德奥合併一旦實現，也同樣塞住了意大利的出路。至於其對問題的解决辦法，則是企圖實現奥匃聨合，以解體法國之衛星小恊約國，斷絶德奥合併的危險，使多瑙河完全受制於羅馬。這不消説又是爲德法及小恊約國所絶對反對的。於是，在奥大利問題上，便形成了這樣的矛盾形勢：法意反德，德意反法，法德反意。</p>
<p>最近號稱小拿破倫的奥總理杜爾夫斯的遇刺，不消説是在希特勒之急欲實現德奥合併的政策下發生的。但事件爆發後，意大利卽動員將近十萬的大軍，佈陣意奥邊陲，聲言（敢有干涉奥國内政者，卽以干戈相見！）同時，南斯拉夫也卽刻戒備起來，德國亦封鎖了德奥邊境，英法則各懷鬼胎，僅表示了在外交上來解决問題的意見，而一般輿論界更大聲疾呼道：（歐洲火藥庫已由巴爾幹移向維也納了！）一時之間，戰雲密佈，在有殘酷的戰爭就要來到之勢。但這是爲的什麽？奥大利問題！</p>
<p>現在，希特勒雖以形勢不佳，曾極力早辯奥國政變與德無關，並角散奥國社黨衝鋒隊，以緩和反德空氣。但其未忘情於德奥合併的籌謀，却爲世人所共知。在其對英報記者的談話中，不是已經公然表示着德奥合併之正當嗎？至於德副總揆巴本之使奥，奥國社黨之繼續活動，更足以證明柏林政府正在向着德奥合併的道路上前進。對此意法當然不會置之不理的。最近奥新副總揆史帶倫堡之訪羅馬，奥國復辟運動之醖釀，羅馬與維也納的密切關係之異於尋常，都是意大利積極圖奥的表現。法國看到了德意衝突的頓行尖鋭化，欲想坐收漁人之利，乃故作鎭靜，不多發具體的言論；甚至在奥國復辟醖釀的消息傳到時，巴黎亦露贊成之意。但莫索里尼也明白事情不甚簡單，反而對奥之復辟運動表示冷淡，谓（哈布斯保復辟問題不如奥國獨立之切要）。如此鈎心鬥角，無論德法意，都是在積極準備如何迎接維也納之新的事變的。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>今後奥大利問題將會得到怎樣解决呢？是實現德奥合併？奥匃聨合？多瑙河聨邦？抑或産生别外的東西呢？這就法德意在問題上的根本矛盾來説，就過去和現在所發生的事變看來，恐怕只有在維也納火藥庫爆發之後才能找到問題之具體的答案了。可是，大家知道，這火藥庫爆發的危險是隨時都有可能發生的，不要説法德意三國正在準備點燃此火藥庫的引綫卽與問題無直接關係之大英帝國亦透露了參戰的意旨，張伯倫之謂（英國國防綫應該移到萊因河畔），便是顯然的例證。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>編劇</h3>
<p>— 建新</p>
<p>編劇家活動的地盤有三方面：話劇界，播音界，和電影界。話劇界的編劇家恐怕要算是最不得意的一種人了，他們的出産很難有脱售的機會，雜誌的編輯先生時常要無情地把他們辛辛苦苦構成的大作給打（回票），使他們耗去的心血化爲烏有。他們與其打算靠寫劇本弄飯吃，倒不如老老實實和衛延殘朱湘一樣去投黄浦江或揚子江的好。播音劇本的編劇家·無聨到把一些封建誨淫的舊小説和鴛鴦蝴蝶派的作品，改編成播音劇本。他們極力迎合聽衆低級趣味的結果，所能得到的報酬，按天算每天也不過塊把錢，按字算，則每千字僅五角錢左右而已。只有電影界的編劇家才是比較幸運的，只有他們能拿他們的一點編撰技術去換取麵包。他們是正式的職業者或半職業者，是我在這篇短文裏所唯一要説到的人物。</p>
<p>首先我想説到的是那正式被電影公司所僱用的一批人。在電影公司裏當這末一名編劇，在不知道内情的人，或許以爲這一定是一個優差；大家都有一個誤解，以爲電影劇本一定都是編劇編的，相信他就是那賦予整個電影以生命的人－單是這種創作力的得以充分發揮一點，他們認爲已够當事人衷心歡娛滿足的了。但事實上他們的生活不會像别人想像的那末美滿。現在我們不妨先從他們所得到的待遇方面説起。我想舉例來説。某公司從前僱用一個起碼的編劇，月薪僅有二十五元。去年曾拍過兩張片子的一家新公司，編劇先生還是因爲友誼關係，才每月從老板那裏勉强支領四十元；本埠某新公司的一位編劇主任月薪也僅有五十元。在大公司裏，如果得有力者的介紹或老板的賞識，一位編劇先生的月薪大致不會少過六十元到八十元之數。從前有一位失業的朋友，爲了覓取生活之資，託一位在某公司服務的友人介紹了一個電影劇本去；老板一見之下深爲滿意，不但出百元購買了那篇劇本，還在（提拔新人才）（？）的口號下，出六十元一月的薪金，請那位月友到公司去替他辦編劇的事。又有一位熟人得了有力者的介紹，以八十元一月的薪金爲交換，曾努力替某公司老板構想故事，編寫對話字幕等。又有一些有號召能力或特殊認識的知名之士，以及一些已有成績表現的旣成編劇家，電影公司一來因爲他們的名字可賣錢，二來也因爲他們的作品可賣座，也多半是肯出更多的價錢僱用這批人的。</p>
<p>這種職業的編劇家，在職務上免不了的時常要碰到一些困難；這困難並不是劇本本身的編寫技術問題，而是編寫時的創作自由問題。决定一個劇本的適用與否，其權操在大老板，大導演甚至大明星們的手裏，編劇家所可能參加的意見是微乎其微的。編劇的過程大槪是這樣：先有一個短短的故事或電影小説－這些並不一定是編劇先生構想出來的－根據這故事或小説，由公司召集劇本討論會；大老板大導演以至大明星們都可在這討論會裏發揮他們的權威；也只有他們的意見寳貴而能得到尊重；一個編劇，卽使他對於自己的見解是怎樣的自負，終不免因爲（人微言輕），他的意見是不可避免的要遭也不能獨自創作，他必須小心地徴取導演的意見；他甚至僅僅寫一個較詳細的分幕的故事，而將詳細的鏡頭留給導演自己動手寫。又，編劇和老板和導演間時常要發生不同的意見；各公司組織的劇本討論會，審查會，或設計委員會的共同討論，或關係人的會談，雖多少可解消這種意見，但大槪的説來，編劇先生多半是必須尊重老板和導演的意見而毁棄自己的意見的。所以他們很難説是一個創作家－自然有少數的例外－有時甚至僅是老板或導演的一個應聲蟲，一個傀儡。到這種塲合，編劇的事就容易幹了，你只須寫上幾個人物，幾塲佈景，幾句對話，幾條字幕，編劇的能事已盡。但這種埋没自己的機械工作幹起來又有什麽意思呢？</p>
<p>上面所説的種種情形，特别在某某公司裏表現得尤爲顯著。眞正自愛的人很難在那樣獨斷的被蔑視的空氣裏多挨度一分鐘。他們决難幹得長久的，多則一年半載，少則三兩個月，也就只好自行捲舖蓋（脱離）了。不過也問或有些聰明人，老板説東他也説東，老板説西他也説西，因而能十分得到重用，這種人的升職加薪那是不用説的了。</p>
<p>説到這裏，我想接着把那班未被影片公司僱用而又時常向影片公司供給劇本的編劇家的生活説一説。他們也許要以一個影片公司顧問的資格，向公司提出製片計劃－例如（生産電影）計劃之類－他們並不一定要到公司去辦公，却每月從公司裏去領取五十元到六十元的報酬。他們創作的電影劇求，若被某家公司採用了－採用的可能很多－每個劇本大致又可使他們有最多三百元少則二百元的收入。這種人大半都是在文學戲劇電影的領域内有較深刻的理解和修養的人，他們的當顧問或寫劇本並非作爲專門職業而從事，雖然他們的目的也都是在努力中國新生電影的發展。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，使我不得不想起了一些無名作家寫電影劇本的空費氣力的事。他們若能得到某家公司的職員或有力者的介紹，他們的劇本也許可僥倖的得到採用；但最多的報酬難過百元。某公司拿出五十元甚至二三十元購買劇本的事也是有過的。他們這樣辦還算得客氣，因爲他們拿到了這種東西，一定要改得一塌糊塗，甚至要改得完全失去了本來面目，他們甚至可以説這是他們自己的創作，而靳不付與你一文錢的。這樣偷作家故事的剝削行爲，我曾聽見好些人説起過。</p>
<p>最後，我想對一些企圖以寫電影劇本來混飯吃的作家們進一點忠告；我想勸他們少對影片公司收外來劇木一事存什麽奢望，因爲除了有熟人介紹之外，他們心血的結晶的東西，是很少有被採用和接受的可能的。尤其是在今日，大導演們都流行着（自編自導）的風氣，你的機會自然是益發的少了。你想你能從大導演那裏去分得若干劇本的酬金，這不能不説是一個莫大的妄想。近來某大公司在新片開映的巨幅廣告旁邊，登了一則地位極小的徴求電影劇本的啟事；我推測應徴的人一定不乏其人；但我又敢説，他們的希望决不會怎末大。如果爲了學習電影劇本編製的技術，則寫作自然是多多益善；但如果在繁忙中撇開了别的事，而希圖以寫電影劇本去換錢，則我以爲還是少費心血的好。過去雖然也有一些電影劇本的劇作家，偶然因爲投了一篇劇本而有過被聘請去當編劇的事，但這種事，現在是少得可以的了；到現在，這種事怕已經難得見到的了。</p>

<h3>旱旱旱旱</h3>
<p>— 奎文</p>
<p>硤石通訊</p>
<p>硤石這地方地勢很高，因此水災是比較的少見，可是旱災－不，祇要十多天不下雨，這裏就成了（不毛之地）。今年的災象自不用説是已經注定的了，從入夏以來就没有見過一滴水量，災，在農村每個人的心弦上彈着，彈着。</p>
<p>四鄉的河流，在一月以前就河底朝天，裂成一條條的龜紋；農人心血結晶的秧苗，都像死蛇般地乾枯了。</p>
<p>目前的硤石農村，佈滿着荒凉的景象。在那兒，農人整天的無事可作，儘白睜着眼望着嫩綠的秧苗一天比一天焦黄，濕潤的田士變成了灰沙；心，也跟着一天比一天憔悴了。</p>
<p>可是，工作儘管没有，吃還是每天需要的；在被災荒侵入的四鄉，糧食又成爲問題了。目前一般的農人的食料，便祇靠着有限的麥子：大半都是把麥子搗碎和水調着，吃一碗半碗的聊爲充飢。在往年有時糧食感到缺乏，還有南瓜及芋奶這一類的東西可以代替；今年連吃這種東西的口福，也竟然隨着乾旱以俱去了！這時就是走遍了四鄉，要想見到一斗米或一元現金，也恐怕比登天還要艱難。農村糧食的缺乏和經濟的總崩潰，在這裏只朋晰的露着全部的輪廓了。</p>
<p>硤石的交通，雖有火車可以到達，那究竟不大方便；他們所靠的還是水路，因爲由水路運輸，可以免掉搬挑的麻煩。現在的河底完全朝天，水路的交通也就因此而斷絶了；三四千靠着河水生活的船户搬夫，便都感到失業的創痛。水，在尋常並不覺得是件可寳貴的東西；可是，在幾月没有雨水的旱聲中，水便成了比一般問題還要嚴重的一個問題。田畝裏需要多量的水來灌溉自不必説，就是耗費極少的飲料，也還是不可須臾和牠分離的！</p>
<p>因此，水在農人的眼中，看來比金子還覺得要寳貴。平常如果不是渴的不得了，他們是不肯搯碗水喝的。有時就是來了親戚朋友，也休想得着一口飲料。在這樣的暑天，因了水的問題他們洗澡和洗衣服都不講求了。這種情形並不是因爲他們的刻薄，也不是他們的懶惰，的確是因爲水没有來源，使他們直覺的感到永的重要是與自己的生命有着不可分離的聨繫。</p>
<p>除了水的問題之外，還有和水的問題嚴重性不相上下的食鹽問題；這食鹽間題雖不及水足以致人死命，可是在身體健康上也還是個莫大的威脅。</p>
<p>硤石的食鹽一向由水路裝運，但在河底朝天，水路交通自然斷絶之後，於是便祇有一個方法雇用人力挑運了。可是，一般油鹽商店雖肯化每擔十角錢的挑費，却是很少有人肯去拚着性命幹那冒暑的工作的。照現有的存鹽的數量看來，淡食的恐慌恐怕就在目前了！</p>
<p>鎭上有些商店，因了貨物來源的缺乏，兼之又没有購買的顧主，致倒閉的數目佔着全鎭三分之二强。同時還有值得痛心的，是價賣子女人口的事件差不多每天都是；這種人世間的悲劇，固然不是人們所能同情，但相反地，他們還是在無辦法的當中找出這最後一條的生路哩！</p>
<p>硤石現在是什麽都完了，往昔的富庶像夢般的没有留下一絲痕跡，過去的産量極其豐富的蠶絲，現在也一落千丈了。近年來世界霍亂般的經濟衰落很快地傳染到了硤石的農村；在以前價值七十元一擔的鮮繭，後來竟跌到三十元。可是，經濟衰落的狂潮愈來愈猛了；今年每擔鮮繭僅值十七八元，而繭商却還嫌這種價錢過分呢。</p>
<p>據一般老年人説，像這樣的災情，祗有咸豐六年才有過一次；但也還没有像現在這樣的（赤地千里）！</p>
<p>現在地方當局，似乎也給兇狠的災荒震醒了，於是（急來抱佛脚）似的頓時手忙脚亂起來。他們第一步救濟的方法，是召集農民開濬河道；每鄉救濟經費祇有大洋三十元，由鄉公所分配工作，這就是所謂的（以工代賑）。開始是每個農民工作一天，得白米半升；這辦法實行不多幾天，便改爲每天銅子十枚，最近竟减少到每天祇有銅元六枚了。在這（米珠薪桂）的社會環境裏，這六個銅子够買糠殼麽？但農民爲了自身的利害關係，却不得不空着肚子苦幹哪！</p>

<h3>中國國際貿易概况</h3>
<p>— 黄宇楨</p>
<p>國際貿易，就是以本國生産有利的物品，來向外國推銷，而使一國民與他國民互相增進其福社和擴充商塲交易的意思。中國本是地大物博，日用所需，多能自給，且國内工業不發達，没有過剩品尋求海外貿易的必要。不過，各國都拿他們的貨物來向中國貿易，我們的貨物來償出口差額起見，也不得不想個方法來應付他們。有人説，中國對外貿易，完全是被動的，確是有點兒不錯。現在限於篇幅，不能多講别的原理，祇就目前對外貿易情形，稍加討論：</p>
<p>就中國國際貿易的歷年統計方面來説，自同治三年以後直至現在（中除五六年外）均爲入超。貿易的總額，雖是逐年增加，但比較進口之增加，總是不及遠甚。光緒二十五年，我國貿易總額，爲四萬六千餘萬兩，比同治三年，約增加了四倍。到了最近，每年進口貨值，總在十億兩上下，出口貨值不過七八億兩，總計達十八億兩以上。民國十七年的進口，爲十一萬九千餘萬兩，出口爲九萬九千一百萬餘兩。去年全國進口貿易，共十九萬萬五千餘萬兩，較前年（二十一年）减少百分之十九。進口總數爲八萬萬餘兩，較前年减少百分之十八。出口總數爲三萬萬一千餘萬兩，較前年减少百分之二十。本年上半年全國對外貿易，輸入總數爲五六九·八四九·八三六元，較上年同期輸入七七一·一○八·○八五元，計减少二○一·二五八·二四九元。輸出總數爲三·二六八·五四四·七一四元，較去年同期三·二九六·四六六·五一九元·計减少二七·九二一·八○五元，入超總額爲三○一·三○五·一二二元。其减少的原因有三：</p>
<p>（一）購買力薄弱：此因這回經濟恐慌，普遍全世界，以致失業的人太多。多數人的進帳，卽一國内之生意，都是很難維持現狀。</p>

The Navy dispatched a Marine battalion led by Lin ahead of time to join forces with the [censored] division to block the attack. The bandits launched a fierce attack for several days, suffering many casualties, but were unsuccessful. When Luocheng was recovered, the bandits retreated in a hurry and were in a disarray. Our sea and land forces launched an assault in the rain on the 16th. The two columns of remaining bandits now have the appearance of turning back to the Gutian border, attempting to break out and flee. Our army is fully prepared and will launch a large-scale encirclement in the coming days to ensure that no bandit escapes. (18th Central News Agency Telegram) Outside Dagu Port</p>

<h3>Real and False Border Situation in Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Farmers in Qigan County, Heilongjiang Province of the puppet state, have been repeatedly captured by Soviet border troops in recent months. After being arrested, their eyes were covered with cloth strips, which were removed only after entering Russian territory.

Finally, they were escorted by Red Guards to visit various military facilities to showcase border defense armaments. After this was completed, they were released. The Japanese side said that Russia was probably intentionally conducting an indirect demonstration of force against Japan. (18th Special Dispatch) Yuguan East Luocheng</p>

<h3>Discussing Bandit Suppression Issues</h3>
<p>No Problem with Reception of Malanyu.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming visited Chiba this morning to discuss the issue of bandit suppression in the Luanyu area. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiba said that the matter of setting up checkpoints at various passes of the Great Wall in Luanyu is in progress and will soon be finalized. The issue of receiving Malanyu Eastern Mausoleums has long been agreed upon. The report that the reason for the delayed implementation was that the Kwantung Army's reply telegram had not been received was a misrepresentation. The sections of the Beiping-Malanyu highway that were destroyed are currently being repaired, and traffic is expected to resume in about a week. At that time, he will accompany Yin Rugeng to handle the handover procedures. The Japanese representative has appointed Mamiya, the commander of the stationed unit in Malanyu, to be responsible. When the puppet troops of the Eastern Mausoleum are replaced, they will all be withdrawn outside the pass. Although many representatives from all parties in the expanded organization of the Eastern Mausoleum Preservation Committee have been nominated, no representative of the Qing Imperial Clan has been selected. It is said that older and more virtuous people are unwilling to take the position, and younger people do not have sufficient qualifications and prestige. According to related parties, the difficulty in selecting a representative of the Imperial Clan has some impact on the reception of the Eastern Mausoleum. They are now urging the selection to be made as soon as possible to facilitate progress. An Qinxing and Sa are preparing to go to Beijing and are currently contacting the Railway Bureau to arrange tickets and seats. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiba said that after the reception of Malanyu, the puppet troops will withdraw, but the Japanese troops will not withdraw, as they are only handing over political power. (18th Special Dispatch) Linhu County</p>

Su Yuqi, the director of the Yuguan Public Security Bureau, reported to the provincial government by telegram that the police force was weak. The provincial government will convene a meeting of the security team leaders in Tianjin within the day. According to a report to the county government from someone who escaped from the bandit den, this gang of bandits has a total of six or seven hundred people, scattered in the areas of Erlang Temple, Jiaoshan, Shimenzhai, and Liujiang. The bandit leader is Lao Haozi, and his subordinate, Xiao Qinglong, is about thirty years old and is called commander by his subordinates. All bandits have a waist tag as proof.

<h3>The Entente Between France and the Soviet Union and the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Since the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, the political situation in Europe has shown signs of unrest. France, whose traditional policy has been to maintain the status quo and uphold the Treaty of Versailles, feels deeply apprehensive, fearing that its hegemony on the European continent will be lost. It has risen quickly and allied with the Soviet Union. Thus, France and the Soviet Union, due to their conflicting interests with Germany, have moved from understanding to rapprochement. Recently, there has even been talk of a military alliance. Considering the past relations between the two countries, diplomatic cooperation is possible. We believe that the Soviet Union's accommodation of French hopes and joining the League of Nations is more reasonable. To say that France and the Soviet Union have concluded a military alliance is an overreaction. It must be known that France's traditional diplomacy has always aimed at maintaining the Treaty of Versailles, with the intention of stabilizing its European hegemony. This has aroused the resentment of Britain, provoked the dissatisfaction of Italy, and led Poland to break away from French control and conclude a friendship agreement with Germany, declaring that in case of an incident, they would negotiate peacefully and not resort to arms. In addition, the countries along the Danube are also gradually showing signs of centrifugal tendencies. This is why France has had to plan remedial measures. Since its independence and the establishment of a socialist state, the Soviet Union has urgently needed peace and security to cultivate its national strength. Therefore, it has striven to approach neighboring Western European countries such as Finland, Poland, and the three Baltic states. The non-aggression treaties it has concluded have been extended to 1945, which can prove that it has no other intentions. In June of this year, the Moscow government was recognized by the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and other countries, further consolidating the foundation of peace in Eastern Europe. France, in view of the fact that the Soviet Union's policy is not in conflict with its own and is beneficial to maintaining the status quo, regards it as a comrade in adversity and strives to win it over to become a member of the League of Nations. Since the withdrawal of Japan and Germany from the League of Nations and Italy's proposal to reorganize it, the League has fallen into a state of decline. If it does not quickly seek remedies, it is in danger of collapse. At that time, France will lose its diplomatic support and will no longer be able to use the alliance clauses in the Treaty of Versailles as an excuse to sanction Germany. The Soviet Union is well aware that France's intention is purely for its own benefit, but it has to deal with it, because since Hitler came to power in Germany, it has used Poland as its vanguard, with the intention of directly attacking Ukraine and passing through the three Baltic states to invade Russia. It is said that the Soviet Union has proposed to Germany to jointly guarantee the independence of the three Baltic states and conclude a peace treaty, but Germany believes that the three Baltic states are independent countries and are not in danger of being invaded, and rejected this proposal. Thus, the Soviet Union's fears deepened, and relations between Germany and the Soviet Union became more rigid. As a result, it also felt the need to join the League of Nations and approach France. Speaking of the relationship between France and the Soviet Union, what we cannot ignore is the Soviet Union's response to the Far Eastern problem. For the Soviet Union, in terms of its national security in Western Europe, "appeasement" has always been its fundamental national policy. However, this is not the case in East Asia. Recently, Japan has fully exposed its militaristic face, not only wanting to seize the opportunity to plunder the Chinese Eastern Railway but also to sweep across Eastern Siberia and Outer Mongolia in one fell swoop. How can the Soviet Union not be strictly guarded against this? There are many reasons why the Japanese have been slow to launch a military attack on Russia. Let us briefly mention the major ones. The first is that Britain's assistance is not yet fully assured. This can be seen from the British-Japanese commercial competition. Although the Japanese are keen to find ways to remedy the situation and seek British understanding, the mutual resentment is deep. Whether it can be reversed is still questionable. The second is that Japan's domestic natural resources are scarce. Compared with Italy, it is only slightly better. The reserves of iron ore, for example, are at most 100 million tons. Major iron and steel plants such as Yawata rely entirely on the supply of Malayan iron ore and Daye iron ore from our country. Otherwise, it would be difficult to sustain. Heavy industry is following in the footsteps and is at a disadvantage in foreign wars. Other factors include the shrinking of American consumption, the sharp decline in Japanese silk exports, the precariousness of the rural economy, the volatility of the international situation, and the difficulty in grasping the direction of foreign policy, all of which affect military plans. All these factors are within our grasp. However, for the sake of military and national defense security, the Soviet Union has never dared to rest on its laurels. This alliance with France, therefore, is to promote security in Western Europe and also to arrange a battle formation in East Asia.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Announces the Truth About Negotiations over the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Accuses Japan of Detaining a Large Number of Russian Employees</p>
<p>And Spreading Shameless Anti-Russian Propaganda</p>
<p>(Moscow) Japan has issued a warning, pointing to unfriendly behavior by the Soviet Russian authorities on the Manchurian border. Today, TASS issued an article in response, stating that Japan is currently detaining a large number of Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway and spreading shameless anti-Russian propaganda, with the intention of forcing Soviet Russia to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway at a low price. TASS also detailed the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, stating that the highest price offered by the Japanese government was 120 million Japanese yen, which was proposed by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on July 23. Hirota also promised to provide severance pay of approximately 30 million yen to the railway employees, which would be borne by (Manchukuo). On July 30, the Soviet Russian government proposed a final sale price of 160 million yen and agreed to pay two-thirds of the purchase price in goods to show its willingness to compromise. However, this proposal by the Russian side was rejected by the Japanese side in early August, after which the negotiations were fruitless. On August 13, the talks suddenly broke down. The chief representative of (Manchukuo) stated that the entire delegation would soon leave the East and return to Manchuria. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Naval Minister Osumi Suggests</h3>
<p>Announce the Abolition of the Washington Treaty Before the Naval Preparatory Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Naval Minister Osumi met with Prime Minister Okada on the 17th for half an hour. It is said that the content was that the government had previously decided to announce the abolition of the Washington Treaty at an appropriate time in the future. However, the naval authorities were not satisfied with this policy, so Naval Minister Osumi suggested to the Prime Minister that Japan should announce the abolition of the Washington Treaty before the opening of the Naval Preparatory Conference.

<h3>Japan Considers Improving Economic Relations with Siam</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the government's implementation of the foreign rice import ban last October, the annual export of Siamese rice to Japan was suddenly cut off, which greatly affected the Siamese economy. Therefore, the bidding for warships built in Siam was unfavorable to Japan. Also, the bidding for electrical machinery, etc., which is currently being planned, is also unfavorable to Japan. In order to improve the economic relations between the two countries, the Japanese authorities decided to consider ways to import Siamese rice. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is negotiating with the various ministries to reach a compromise. However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry opposes the import of foreign rice because Japan's domestic rice production is excessive and there is no place to consume it.

<h3>Hitler Appeals to the Nation to Take Restoration as His Duty</h3>
<p>Merge the Positions of President and Chancellor</p>
<p>Willing to Have the People Vote to Support Him</p>
<p>International Peace Should Not Forget Equality</p>
<p>Hamburg Chancellor Hitler arrived here by plane today, where he was welcomed by 38,000 stormtroopers and members of other groups. Hundreds of thousands of people watched along the way. Mr. Hitler visited the city hall and then toured the entire port. Wherever he went, the masses cheered and paid their respects. Mr. Hitler delivered a two-hour speech at the city hall, which was broadcast nationwide by radio. After the speech, the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Mr. Hitler first spoke of the reasons for merging the positions of President and Chancellor, saying that Germany has been without a head of state for several weeks, which creates an opportunity for reckless troublemakers to plunge the country into turmoil. He dared to decide that the public vote on August 17 would approve his actions. He was confident that he would be able to continue to add honor to the title of German Chancellor. Mr. Hitler then described his life and political views during and after the European War, as well as the origins of the creation of National Socialism. He went on to say that Germany's corrupt parliamentary democratic system did not represent the will of the people and, as a result, fostered internal strife and weakened the country's vitality. This kind of decadent democracy only allowed those who arbitrarily tempted the people to achieve their ambitions. There was no connection between the Marxist Party and the National Rights Party. Their infighting would only lead to Bolshevik chaos. His own victory would be called a major turning point in German history. If the new movement could devote itself to working with its body and mind, this victory would eventually come. At this point, Mr. Hitler said calmly: "I cannot shake my belief in this victory, but it requires time, not years. The world cannot survive without critics, but it cannot survive without laborers. When the venerable old man asked me to take up his task, I did not hesitate to agree because I did not want to shirk responsibility to the world for my actions. Germany will never sacrifice its honor and equal rights. The German government and people are filled with a firm desire to do their best to maintain world peace." Mr. Hitler used these firm remarks to express Germany's attitude on the position it should hold among the world's major powers, and thus concluded his earnest appeal to the people. Thereupon, those in the hall stood up and cheered, and the sound was like thunder. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Tells the People</h3>
<p>Appeals for Sincere Unity</p>
<p>Vote to Support the Government</p>
<p>Not for His Personal Honor or Disgrace</p>
<p>But for the Rise and Fall of the Country's Future</p>
<p>The people of Hamburg will hold a vote tomorrow to express their support or opposition to the Hitler government. Chancellor Hitler began speaking to the nation at 8:35 tonight, calling on the people to unite sincerely. Hitler's broadcast speech reached the entire country, with approximately 30 million listeners. Mr. Hitler said that he was willing to use his intelligence and life to create a responsible government. Those who vote to support the government's actions and national unity are not doing so for his personal honor or disgrace, but for the rise and fall of the country's future. Mr. Hitler added that the second revolution has now come to an end. In the political sphere, Germany is now based on the National Socialist Party, and in the military sphere, it is based on the German army, and it will no longer be manipulated by the interests of biased capitalists. He warned that if anyone continues to disrupt Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party, they will be dealt with in the same swift manner as the last incident, and no leniency will be shown. Mr. Hitler also vehemently denounced the idea of restoring the parliamentary system in Germany, saying that the parliamentary system promoted national division, the loss of German authority, and frequent internal strife. He said that within a few weeks, Germany lost the respect of the outside world, which would take decades of effort to restore. The government's current policy program will focus on relieving agriculture and solving the unemployment problem, and he believed that it would be successful because there was no other way. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>The Cabinet Grants Him Special Powers (Berlin)</h3>
<p>Hitler delivered a speech at the Hamburg City Hall Auditorium at 8:30 tonight, lasting an hour and a half. In brief (after the death of the former president, some people outside Germany believed that with the departure of this old man, Germany would be plunged into internal strife, or that the National Socialist movement would disintegrate, or that the National Socialist Party would clash with the Wehrmacht. Others said that the leaders of the National Socialist Party would quarrel among themselves over the issue of presidential succession. Those who made these remarks had a sense of schadenfreude, but they were also filled with anxiety and fear. The cabinet, in view of the widespread rumors, resolutely decided to appoint him to hold the powers of both the head of state and the chancellor; otherwise, it would not have done so abruptly without first soliciting the public opinion of the people. The solicitation of public opinion, although there is a difference in sequence, the result is the same: the German government originally had the official power to combine the powers of the president and the chancellor into one.)</p>
<h3>Denounces the Parliamentary System (Hitler)</h3>
<p>Then Praises Former President Hindenburg</p>
<p>Saying that Hindenburg Was the Mediator Between the Old Germany of Yesterday and the New Germany of the Future, and Was the Most Impartial Arbiter for the German People. He had a Particularly Cordial Friendship with Hitler. Mr. Hitler went on to say: "The merger of the powers of the President and the Chancellor, no matter how logical it is, and no matter how legal it is under the Constitution, I must have the public decision of the people, and I do not recognize it as an established law. How the future Constitution of Germany will be, I dare not predict, but I will certainly be able to make the German Chancellor bear a great reputation in the future." Hitler then described how Germany implemented a corrupt parliamentary system after the European War, which led to the deterioration of national affairs. He said: "Parliamentary democracy often bankrupts the nation and the country, and it is always so. The corruption of politics is the bankruptcy of the economy. When members of parliament take the opportunity to attack the government, the people in power will never have the courage to take on great things. Therefore, under the parliamentary system, the government is listless and lifeless, and it is impossible to seek its creative ability. When Germany implemented the parliamentary system, the prestige it lost in a few weeks could only be restored after more than a decade of work."</p>
<h3>Turning Point in German History (Hitler)</h3>
<p>Then Described How He Realized National Socialism</p>
<p>Briefly Said: "During the European War, I was in the ranks, and I was a nobody. I tried to reform politics because of the impact of the war. Fifteen years ago, I was an assetless, unassisted, and nameless foot soldier who stood up and fought. Looking around, everyone was my enemy. In the end, I was able to win, and my victory was a major turning point in German history. If you compare the current political, economic, and spiritual situation in Germany with the situation fifteen years ago, you will know that the difference between the past and the present is obvious. However, this kind of change was still considered impossible by the general public not long ago." Hitler then recalled the sacrifices of the National Socialist Party and the moderation of the National Socialist revolution. "We do not want bloodshed, and our goal is not revenge. We only want to make the people believe in the new ideology." Hitler then fiercely attacked those who slandered him, saying that the world can do without critics, but it cannot do without workers. He said: "There is a kind of person who specializes in slandering others as their ability, but they are unwilling to bear any responsibility. This kind of destructive behavior is what I oppose, because my goal is to maintain the principle of authority. The world should know that Germany has an authoritative government, which is not only a blessing for the Germans but also a blessing for the neighboring countries. The only political will of the German nation is represented by the National Socialist Party, and its only military force is represented by the army."</p>
<h3>I Also Want the World to Understand Two Things (I want the world to understand two things:)</h3>
<p>(1) Germany's honor and equal rights can never be sacrificed. The German people have already straightened out their internal affairs and will proceed to protect the independence of the country externally. Anyone who invades it will not be tolerated by us. (2) The German government and people all want to do their best to protect peace. German politics is backed by the people's belief, and there is no need to beg for help from military force. The public vote on August 19 will once again show the world the consolidation of Germany, which can be asserted.</p>
<h3>The German Revolution Has Ended The German Revolution era has now ended.</h3>
<p>I am determined to warn anyone who wants to prevent or disrupt the evolution of the new Germany by violence, and I will use national authority to strike them. As for the rights of the two major Christian factions, I will work hard to protect them and make them compatible with the current situation of the country. The new national authority can also solve economic problems. The needs of the people's lives are planned by the leaders and produced by the workers, so there is no need to worry about lack. We have found work and food and clothing for 4.5 million unemployed people in 18 months, which is no small feat. We can also prove to the world that no force can destroy Germany economically. Other nations should know that it is better to cooperate with each other to seek the revival of the international community than to fight each other internationally. However, the German people should also understand that if they cannot unite with each other to make the country strong, then it is impossible for Germany to be respected. My only task is to restore Germany to its freedom and health, and to restore its happiness. As long as I have a breath, I will not forget this task.</p>
<h3>Therefore, I Now Ask the People to Make a Public Decision Therefore, I am requesting a public vote on the law of August 2.</h3>
<p>However, there are no shortage of treacherous enemies in the world. Everything we do is often interpreted maliciously and destroyed internationally by them. This is what you should know. My request for a public vote is for the sake of the German people, not for my own sake. What needs to be expressed by the people is trust in the German Chancellor. I am just a spokesperson for you. What else is so unique about me? What those who have been in power before me have been trying to do for fifteen or even twenty years without success, I have been able to accomplish in eighteen months. Therefore, theoretically speaking, since they have failed, they should at least give me fifteen years of time to achieve my goals. I have struggled hard to gain power. In the history of my fifteen years of struggle, I have been consistent and have never changed my original intentions, even when I was in prison. The banner I have faithfully guarded is the flag of Germany today. All of this, even those who slander me the most, cannot deny. As a result of my fifteen years of struggle, it has been successful and has improved Germany's internal and external status. This is also what those who slander me cannot but admit. My actions may not be without fault, but who can be without fault? I can be held responsible for it. I can be confident that there is nothing in my struggle that has not benefited the German people, because my actions are always based on the welfare of Germany. This ambition can be revealed to the heavens and the sun!</p>
<h3>Herr Hitler's Motives for Hamburg Speech</h3>
<p>Herr Hitler's choice of Hamburg as the location for his speech was for two reasons: firstly, because the Hamburg petite bourgeoisie had expressed doubts about National Socialism for some time, and Herr Hitler specifically went there to enlighten them on the spot; secondly, the discord between the central government's representative in Hamburg, Gauleiter Kaufmann, and Hamburg Mayor Krogmann was common knowledge among the citizens of Hamburg, and this was also a reason for Herr Hitler's visit. Kaufmann was not originally from Hamburg. Before achieving his ambitions, he was involved in various activities with workers and had a rather romantic lifestyle. He was a typical (National Socialist Party veteran), lacking specialized knowledge or a profession, but full of political enthusiasm. After the National Socialist Party gained power, he was appointed as the leader of the National Socialist Party in the Hamburg region, at the age of thirty-four. Mayor Krogmann was a Hamburg bourgeois who started in business. Although he was also a member of the National Socialist Party, he was cautious and down-to-earth. The backgrounds of the two men were so different. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hindenburg's Son's Declaration (Berlin)</h3>
<p>Colonel Oskar, son of the late President Hindenburg, will issue a declaration via radio broadcast tonight. The Volksbeobachter has preemptively disclosed its full text, which briefly states that since his father and Hitler joined hands as comrades on January 30, 1933, his father had often expressed his approval of Hitler's character and had also frequently agreed with the decisions of the Hitler government. Oskar then recounted the late president's speech on November 9th of last year, in which he supported Hitler's policies with frank and clear language, and concluded by saying, (My father himself had already regarded Hitler as his direct successor, worthy of being the supreme leader of the German nation. Therefore, in accordance with my father's will, I urge all men and women of the nation to approve the legal transfer of the presidential powers previously held by my father to Hitler through the plebiscite on August 19th).

<h3>Communist Party Counter-Propaganda (Berlin)</h3>
<p>From the National Socialist Party's point of view, Hitler's speech last night had a good chance of success. They are confident that this speech has swayed those who were wavering to vote for Hitler tomorrow. Therefore, the 100,000 workers in the National Socialist Party are now elated. However, they are very strict in preventing opposition party propaganda. It is reported that many members of the Communist Party have been arrested. The Communist Party is currently using various methods to distribute texts and carry out large-scale propaganda, disguising communist books as novels and printing Communist Party proposals on extremely small pieces of paper so that they can be easily disseminated and read with a magnifying glass.

<p>Hitler's Party Members Arrested in Rome　　All Parties Pay Attention to the Meeting Between Italy and Austria　　Rome has learned today from reliable sources that three members of the German National Socialist Party were recently arrested in Rome. These individuals were carrying bombs and were likely planning terrorist acts in Italy. Germany is very resentful of Italy's attitude towards the Austrian issue. Rumors are circulating that the extremist faction of the German National Socialist Party has formed an organization with the aim of (teaching Italy a lesson). (Reuters dispatch, 18th)　　Rome Europe is now widely speculating that Italy may be changing its views on the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. It is also rumored that Austrian President Miklas will resign this year. Therefore, the general public is paying close attention to the upcoming meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg. Because the Italian Prime Minister must personally participate in the Italian Army's grand maneuvers, he will meet with the Austrian Chancellor during the grand maneuvers next week. However, the time and location of the meeting have not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)　　Vatican City According to news from Rome received by the Legitimist faction of the Royalist Party in the Vatican, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has rejected the plan for the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy in Austria. According to the Royalists, the UK was originally expected to maintain a neutral attitude towards the restoration plan, and the Little Entente could be appeased by France. All that was needed was for Italy to initiate the process for it to succeed. Now that Mussolini has expressed his rejection, the restoration plan seems to have encountered an obstacle. (Havas dispatch, 17th)　　Rome The Stefani News Agency confirms that Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will meet between Florence and Bologna during the Italian army exercises from August 19 to 24. The measures taken by the two prime ministers to guarantee Austria will have an international character and must at least obtain the approval of the UK and France. From this, it can be seen that there will be extensive discussions on the Austrian issue diplomatically. The meeting between the Italian and Austrian prime ministers is only the beginning. (Havas dispatch, 17th)　　Rome The Italian army will begin maneuvers in Tuscany and the Apennine Mountains tomorrow. The troops participating in the exercises are now continuously heading to their destinations. The mobilized reserve troops have good appearance and discipline.

It will also propose to disband national air forces and create an international aerial guard force. Countries should conclude non-aggression and mutual assistance pacts that are as solid as iron and implemented worldwide through the League of Nations. Mr. Attlee also said that he is prepared to abandon the idea of (British naval dominance), but other countries must also make concessions.

<h3>China's Economic Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The Financial Times commented today on the impact of British silver purchases on commerce and China's general economic situation, saying that higher silver prices can indeed increase the Far East's purchasing power from the West, but a higher value must first be established, and this procedure may cause disputes serious enough to defeat the purpose of raising prices. However, it seems premature to make such pessimistic worries about this matter, as it is still unknown today whether the U.S. government actually wants to buy large amounts of silver on overseas markets. It is assumed that what the United States wants to do is merely to appease the silver faction. Anything beyond this is not what they want, but even this move is enough to make China uneasy. If China is forced too much, it will adopt a managed currency system. Although this move is extremely unsuitable for China, it seems that there is no other feasible method other than this. If this happens, the silver industry and Western trade related to the East will be severely hit. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Stratospheric Exploration</h3>
<p>Belgian Scientists Depart Again　　Aims to Ascend to 17,000 Meters　　Belgium A new stratospheric scientific expedition by Hohenens is departing from here today. Professor Piccard and his assistant Fanters are ascending in a balloon today, hoping to conduct research at altitudes between 15,000 feet and 17,000 meters. The two ascended at 6:19 this morning, planning to land in Bavaria around 6:00 p.m. No fewer than several thousand people gathered near the mountains and roadsides to watch the balloon ascend. As the balloon gradually moved upward, the onlookers burst into cheers. In 1931, Professor Piccard and Professor Piccard completed their first famous stratospheric study using this same balloon. The metal gondola suspended below the balloon has fifteen parachutes for the people and instruments in the balloon to descend. The balloon carries 1,000 kilograms of sand and 250 grams of water. Hohenens is a young scientist of twenty-nine years old, tall and fair-skinned with grey eyes. Fanters is twenty-three years old and is a student at the University of Brussels. The two do not want to break any formal or informal records held by the United States or the Soviet Union. When Hohenens is at high altitude, he will do his best to observe cosmic rays and believes that cosmic rays may be able to break the outer shells of atoms and study the microscopic particles inside them. If Hohenens can prove that his theory is correct, then it may be possible to utilize the infinite potential energy in the atmosphere and the stratosphere. Due to wind turbulence, the balloon was swaying constantly at an altitude of ten to eleven miles, but the people in the balloon were still communicating frequently with the ground. There were also two cars following below, and an airplane was also flying low alongside the balloon to prevent it from being blown by a hurricane into the sea or high mountains. The balloon has a volume of 16,000 cubic meters and is filled with light gas supplied by the Belgian army. (National News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>### Sudden Emergency in Japan's State of Emergency (Japanese Dispatch)</h3>
<p>Diplomacy Increasingly Worsening, Internal Affairs Increasingly Difficult. Since the formation of the Okada Cabinet, the general situation in Japanese politics seemed calm, with a good possibility of overcoming the so-called state of emergency. However, in fact, there were two huge undercurrents that especially concerned the Japanese people and political authorities. The first was the so-called diplomatic problem, especially diplomacy with the United States. Since the exchange of documents between Hirota and Hull, the hidden reefs between Japan and the United States seemed to have been covered up by the rising tide, so she was very optimistic, thinking that there would be no trouble in the Pacific. In addition, with considerable confidence in China and Britain, Japan was quite confident that it was enough to be optimistic. Therefore, Duke Fumimaro Konoe (an excellent politician among the nobles, with close ties to the Araki faction) was specially sent to the United States, on the one hand, to find out the true situation in the United States, and at the same time to find ways to gradually bring Japan and the United States closer. On the other hand, Japan's diplomatic skills were used to enable Japan's naval plan to be realized, so that the hegemony of the West Pacific could be established, and the superior interests of the Far East could be further guaranteed. However, the tendency of the facts was exactly the opposite. The United States' understanding of the Far East was indeed different from Japan's, and it believed that Japan was too vicious, so it stepped up the defense of Pearl Harbor, planned to send a team of aircraft to scout Alaska, and build an air force base somewhere in the Aleutian Islands. This proves that the hidden reefs between Japan and the United States are still hidden there, and Duke Konoe has no way to remove them. There is also the relationship between Britain and Japan. Theoretically, in some respects, especially on the issue of the Soviet Union, it is almost on a single line, and a political alliance can be established to jointly subdue the Soviet Union and divide the hegemony in the Pacific equally. However, actual interests, such as the division of the Far East market and the sales market for cotton products, are all in conflict with the British Empire, and the conflicts are extremely acute. This matter is very difficult to resolve properly by peaceful means, so the British-Japanese political alliance will be affected. The Japanese diplomatic authorities, in view of the increasingly urgent crisis with the Soviet Union, believed that diplomacy could no longer be isolated in the future, so they vigorously advocated that the most important work of the Okada Cabinet was to open up the diplomatic situation, smooth over relations with Britain and the United States, and completely grasp China in its hands. This would be enough to deal with the Soviet Union and implement its Greater Asia Doctrine. But it turned out that a very important problem occurred in her own country, so there was a second argument. Secondly, it is about Japan's internal affairs, especially the rural problem, which is the biggest problem facing Japan today. In general society, rural unrest will cause the development of the entire social contradiction. For example, the price of raw silk fell, followed by the low price of spring cocoons. According to the estimate of the Japan Imperial Agricultural Association, due to the decline in the price of cocoons, rural income will be reduced by 180 million yen. In an instant, autumn cocoons will be on the market again, and the raw silk market does not have the hope of good sales. The crisis ahead, I really don’t know how to make up for it. What's more, the debt of Japanese rural villages is about the same as in the previous two years, with a total amount of more than 700 million yen. Although the price of rice has risen slightly recently, farmers have not received any real benefits. They still have to buy expensive rice with cash, so they are still very poor. Secondly, the total debt of the industrial and commercial sectors is about 1.5 billion yen. Although this cannot be called a fatal injury, it is also a major cancer in the financial world. If exports are slightly hit, the so-called (boom) will stop immediately, and the flaws in the industrial and commercial sectors will be exposed. Now India and other autonomous territories and colonies of the British Empire are restricting the import of Japanese manufactured goods, and the Dutch East Indies has followed suit. It is difficult to get a favorable compromise at the Japanese-Dutch conference. Economic phenomena in other parts of the world are not good, so Japan's exports are not optimistic after all. In this way, it may be very difficult to maintain the current market prosperity by relying solely on military industry. What's more, the so-called prosperity at present is not substantial. In addition, many places in Japan have been affected by drought this year, and the price of rice has been rising steadily, which is not good for farmers. If the harvest is too bad, it will cause more rural unrest. As a result of the intensification of the situation, the government also believes that this is an imminent crisis and should be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise, once the entire economic crisis breaks out, the harm will be more serious than the isolation of agricultural associations from diplomacy. The Okada Cabinet, which is not unified itself, is trying its best to plan and coordinate these two problems, and is preparing to stabilize its war foundation in diplomacy and internal affairs. But in fact, there is no way to have both. (Tokyo, August 10, 1934) British Colony</p>
<h3>Resisting the Dumping of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Implementing a Textile Control Policy. A special dispatch from Singapore states that Britain, as a country with light industries, exports cotton textiles, the most valuable goods. Therefore, the rise and fall of the cotton textile market in Lancashire, the center of the British cotton textile industry, can represent the prosperity and decline of the British national economy. In addition to China in the Far East, the sales of British cotton textiles all rely on its colonies as the tail, so the colonial market has a very large relationship with the British mainland. However, since Japan implemented a dumping policy, British cotton textiles were first threatened in the Indian market. The United Kingdom was forced to announce the abolition of the Japanese-Indian Treaty of Commerce, and the dumping of Japanese goods in India was slightly restricted. However, the Japanese were not discouraged by this setback and turned to the British colonies in Southeast Asia, actively implementing dumping, resulting in the market of cotton textiles in Malaya and Ceylon being flooded with Japanese goods in recent years, and British goods were almost unable to stand firm. The British government, reluctantly, adopted a stricter policy in mid-May of this year, issuing a general order to all colonies to implement cotton textile control to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Singapore and Malaya have successively implemented it, but this policy has recently suffered an unexpected twist, that is, Ceylon, another British colony in the southern Indian peninsula, its government and people believe that after the promulgation of the regulations restricting the import of cotton textiles, cheap Japanese goods will inevitably be replaced by expensive British goods, which will have a very significant impact on the livelihood of the local people. Therefore, they expressed their opposition, and it was heard that the ministers in the Ceylonese government intended to resign collectively to fight for it. For a time, the British policy seemed to have suffered a great blow, until the 1st of this month, the ministers held another informal meeting and finally decided to cancel their resignation and agreed to accept the British government's regulations restricting the import of foreign cotton textiles. Britain's policy towards Japan has achieved further success, so we believe that Britain's defense line against the dumping of Japanese goods has been completely formed, and it is not impossible.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of People's Psychology</h3>
<p>Chinese people have always adhered to the ancient saying of "not holding office, not planning its policies" when it comes to national affairs, and adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Not only are the general uneducated people like this, but most of the intellectual class are also like this. Take the traitors who act as running dogs for the Japanese as an example. If it is said that they do not love China but love Japan, this is beyond human nature and absolutely impossible. Then, why do they become traitors and running dogs? Although there are many reasons, to sum it up, it is entirely based on their own position, only knowing that there is a family, but not knowing that there is a country. Recently, because of the various oppressions suffered from the Japanese, they realized that what they thought before was completely contrary to the current facts. Therefore, they realized that the family would not exist if the country was destroyed, that the family and the country are inseparable, and that the country is more important than the family. Therefore, many people in various places in the Northeast have destroyed their homes to save the country. In the evolution of people's psychology, we should pay special attention to the fact that in the three years since the incident, the psychological evolution has been extremely rapid. Detailed analysis can be divided into four stages. First, in the year after the September 18th Incident, most people's psychology was that as long as they could live a peaceful life, they all adopted a calm attitude, and even delusional to welcome the Japanese to rule according to law, hoping to enjoy a happy and prosperous life. Second, starting from the summer of last year, seeing that the Japanese had taken over the general political power, and thinking of the tragedy after the fall of Korea, they felt great panic, but they also estimated that their strength was insufficient and it was difficult to defeat the high-pressure forces, resulting in a temporary endurance psychology. Third, because the Japanese investigated household registration, registered goods, and imposed miscellaneous taxes last fall, one after another, they felt that it was a dream to seek a peaceful life. Therefore, a question arose in their minds, and everywhere they could hear questions such as "What should we do?" This proves that the vast masses have gone from a psychology of not caring to wanting to find ways to deal with it, but they still show a spirit of not resisting defeat, holding a careful and cautious attitude. The most valuable goods were cotton textiles, so the rise and fall of the cotton textile market in Lancashire, the center of the British cotton textile industry, can represent the prosperity and decline of the British national economy. In addition to China in the Far East, the sales of British cotton textiles all rely on its colonies as the tail, so the colonial market has a very large relationship with the British mainland. However, since Japan implemented a dumping policy, British cotton textiles were first threatened in the Indian market. The United Kingdom was forced to announce the abolition of the Japanese-Indian Treaty of Commerce, and the dumping of Japanese goods in India was slightly restricted. However, the Japanese were not discouraged by this setback and turned to the British colonies in Southeast Asia, actively implementing dumping, resulting in the market of cotton textiles in Malaya and Ceylon being flooded with Japanese goods in recent years, and British goods were almost unable to stand firm. The British government, reluctantly, adopted a stricter policy in mid-May of this year, issuing a general order to all colonies to implement cotton textile control to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Singapore and Malaya have successively implemented it, but this policy has recently suffered an unexpected twist, that is, Ceylon, another British colony in the southern Indian peninsula, its government and people believe that after the promulgation of the regulations restricting the import of cotton textiles, cheap Japanese goods will inevitably be replaced by expensive British goods, which will have a very significant impact on the livelihood of the local people. Therefore, they expressed their opposition, and it was heard that the ministers in the Ceylonese government intended to resign collectively to fight for it. For a time, the British policy seemed to have suffered a great blow, until the 1st of this month, the ministers held another informal meeting and finally decided to cancel their resignation and agreed to accept the British government's regulations restricting the import of foreign cotton textiles. Britain's policy towards Japan has achieved further success, so we believe that Britain's defense line against the dumping of Japanese goods has been completely formed, and it is not impossible.</p>
<h3>A General Overview of Field Surveys in the Northeast</h3>
<p>30 Million Compatriots Prepare for Full Mobilization to Resist Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese Viciousness Will Leave No Chicken or Dog Alive in the Northeast. Northeast News Agency reporter Mr. Yichuan sneaked back to the Northeast in March of this year. He stayed in major cities and towns, and trekked through the mountains of eastern Jilin and Heilongjiang. His journey was more than 4,000 miles, and he worked for five months, experiencing all kinds of hardships, in order to conduct an on-the-spot survey of the actual situation in the Northeast for the two years after the fall. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago, and based on his observations, he summarized as follows.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of People's Psychology</h3>
<p>Chinese people have always adhered to the ancient saying of "not holding office, not planning its policies" when it comes to national affairs, and adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Not only are the general uneducated people like this, but most of the intellectual class are also like this. Take the traitors who act as running dogs for the Japanese as an example. If it is said that they do not love China but love Japan, this is beyond human nature and absolutely impossible. Then, why do they become traitors and running dogs? Although there are many reasons, to sum it up, it is entirely based on their own position, only knowing that there is a family, but not knowing that there is a country. Recently, because of the various oppressions suffered from the Japanese, they realized that what they thought before was completely contrary to the current facts. Therefore, they realized that the family would not exist if the country was destroyed, that the family and the country are inseparable, and that the country is more important than the family. Therefore, many people in various places in the Northeast have destroyed their homes to save the country. In the evolution of people's psychology, we should pay special attention to the fact that in the three years since the incident, the psychological evolution has been extremely rapid. Detailed analysis can be divided into four stages. First, in the year after the September 18th Incident, most people's psychology was that as long as they could live a peaceful life, they all adopted a calm attitude, and even delusional to welcome the Japanese to rule according to law, hoping to enjoy a happy and prosperous life. Second, starting from the summer of last year, seeing that the Japanese had taken over the general political power, and thinking of the tragedy after the fall of Korea, they felt great panic, but they also estimated that their strength was insufficient and it was difficult to defeat the high-pressure forces, resulting in a temporary endurance psychology. Third, because the Japanese investigated household registration, registered goods, and imposed miscellaneous taxes last fall, one after another, they felt that it was a dream to seek a peaceful life. Therefore, a question arose in their minds, and everywhere they could hear questions such as "What should we do?" This proves that the vast masses have gone from a psychology of not caring to wanting to find ways to deal with it, but they still show a spirit of not resisting defeat, holding a careful and cautious attitude. Fourth, this spring, because of the implementation of land tax collection, the collection of firearms, the conscription of young men, and the selection of young women by household to prepare for the Japanese army to solve their animal desires, everyone felt insecure and knew that what they thought before was completely wrong. Not only was there no hope of living a peaceful life, but their own homes had completely lost their protection. Therefore, they disregarded everything and rose up to resist Japan. For example, the people of Yilan, Yanshou, Mishan, Boli and other counties in eastern Jilin, knowing that their strength was limited, also raised their arms and rose up. This expression is transformed from fear of the Japanese into hatred, forming a hostile and irreconcilable situation. In the current stage of evolution, what is expressed in the general public is full of anti-Japanese sentiment. Therefore, regardless of the matter and who the person is, those who can sympathize with anti-Japanese resistance and help our strength are all close to and love them. On the contrary, they hate and resent them. The psychology of the people in the Northeast has now reached this point, and it is not difficult to predict to what extent it will evolve in the future. Because in the past, the Northeast was vast and rich in resources, and people's lives were easy. In addition, the idea of ​​family safety and not caring about other things was not shaken by any external forces. Now rural areas are bankrupt, people are unemployed, the economy is extremely tight, personal life is panicked, parents and wives are separated, and everything is completely lost. It is as if it has been completely lifted from a paradise to a hell. The impact and stimulation are indescribable.</p>
<h3>The Psychology of the Volunteer Army and the Puppet Army</h3>
<p>In the past, the psychology of ordinary soldiers in the Northeast only knew that there were officers and not the country. They ate the country's pay and served as the officer's soldiers to maintain their personal lives. The officers only knew that they had themselves and used the country's pay to raise their own soldiers. After the incident, the officials only knew that they had themselves, so in order to maintain their position and salary, they became the claws of the Japanese, killing their own compatriots. They laughed and scolded as they pleased, and they were the only ones who perished the country. Recently, they felt that although the officials were high, they had no power, and they had to go to work on time every day and retire on time. Not only were they not as comfortable as before, but they would be humiliated by the Japanese if they were not careful. At this moment, they have tasted the taste of being an official of a perished country, and they are all weeping and swallowing their voices, waiting for the time to revolt. Even those who are truly pro-Japanese personally fawn over and cater to them, and dare not use their position as officials to drive others, fearing that their subordinates will rebel and cause danger to their own lives. As for the soldiers, in the past, in order to maintain their lives, they all held a psychology of enduring for a while. Recently, because the army has been repeatedly downsized and eliminated, it is better to escape with guns and live a life of eating and drinking wherever they go. At the same time, because joining the volunteer army can also remove the title of slave of a perished country, it is a so-called win-win situation, so why not do it? Therefore, recently, many puppet troops have escaped with weapons, which can also be seen in the psychology of the puppet troops. The psychology and background of the volunteer army are also very complex. To sum up, it can be divided into several types: some joined because they were motivated by national consciousness and forced by righteous indignation, some joined because they were forced by circumstances, some joined because they were forced by life, and some joined because they propagated doctrines. Now, because of the lack of materials and the weakness of their strength, they cannot advance and have no way to retreat. The only thing they desire is to get real help, and they do not care about anything else. This phenomenon can be said to be a transformation from a self-interested psychology to a group-benefiting psychology. Now, more than 30 leaders of the volunteer army in 15 counties including Bin County, Acheng, Zhuhe, Yanshou, Fangzheng, Boli, Mishan, Baoqing, Yilan, Huachuan, Fujin, Raohe, Hulin, Suibin, and Tongjiang in Jilin Province have a population of more than 200,000. If considerable personnel go there, add compilation, and help with strength, it is true to recover the lost land.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese army, on the surface, is well-trained and seems impressive, but among the people often seen by Japanese soldiers, they often see young soldiers crying and complaining to them, saying that there are parents and brothers at home, and they fear that they will not be able to return home to see each other in this life. Although this dares not summarize everything, it can also be seen. When the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, it showed its national military power everywhere, such as airplane performances, artillery displays, etc. With a small number of troops, it occupied one city at a time, and then went east and west, circulating endlessly, to shape its size. Recently, due to the tense situation between Japan and Russia, the previously scattered troops have been concentrated. In Heilongjiang Province, they are concentrated in Beian Town and Zhalaantun, the provincial capital, etc. In Jilin Province, they are concentrated in Changchun, Jiamusi, and Yimianpo, etc. Only two counselors and instructors are left in the outer counties. In addition, because volunteer armies have risen in various places, a small number of troops have been sent to various places. In reality, not only do they have no strength to eliminate the volunteer army, but they are also in danger of being eliminated by the volunteer army from time to time. This is the biggest reason for promoting the concentration of the Japanese army. The stationed reclamation army in various places in Japan has no discipline and often conflicts with local people. For example, there are 200 soldiers stationed in Hunanying, Yilan County. They arbitrarily collect land and molest women. They often enter people's homes naked and say to women, "Sex, sex," arousing civil unrest. This is the main reason. Every time the Japanese army sets out to attack the volunteer army, they avoid small roads and order the puppet army to be in front and the Japanese army to be behind to prevent the volunteer army from shooting. However, because the clothes worn by the Japanese and puppet troops are different, the volunteer army, because they communicate with the puppet troops, lie in ambush in the dark and do not shoot at the puppet troops in front, but only shoot at the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese army accused the puppet army of colluding with the volunteer army, so they have completely reduced the number of formal troops in the Northeast and supplemented them with local guerrillas. Also, fearing that the guerrillas would inform the volunteer army, they only gave 20 bullets when they set out. Recently, in view of the frequent rebellions of the puppet army, they have vigorously implemented the Baojia system, selecting militiamen with family property to prevent their rebellion. However, no matter what methods the Japanese army adopts, they are all ineffective. Therefore, they dare not actively attack the army in eastern Jilin to prevent a group of people from responding.</p>
<h3>The Economic Situation of the Northeast</h3>
<p>In the Northeast, there were many different kinds of paper money in the past, and the monetary system was extremely chaotic. However, the economic foundation was not stable, and the people were not panicking. After the Incident (Mukden Incident), the puppet state planned to unify the monetary system, issuing puppet Manchurian currency, and set the end of June this year to cancel all previous kinds of paper money. Recently, due to the fact that it could not be implemented, it was extended for another year. Examining the reason why it could not be cancelled, it is because the people were mostly afraid that the newly issued puppet Manchurian currency would become waste paper in the future, and they developed a psychology of distrust, and felt that the previous kinds of paper money were more valuable than the puppet Manchurian currency. Also, because too much puppet Manchurian currency was initially issued, there was a tendency to suspend exchange, fearing that it would fall into the same rut as Russian Chiang Tie (Rubles). Recently, because the Japanese collected land deeds and increased taxes, the people's economic situation has become more and more difficult. In the past, the people of the Northeast regarded land and grain as the foundation of economic activity. Now, the price of grain has fallen strangely. For example, soybeans, before the Incident, were about twenty yuan per stone, but now they are sold for one yuan and five jiao, which is still a matter of price only with no market. This situation is especially serious in the Jidong area. People trade with opium instead of currency, so the number of opium smokers in the Northeast has increased by seven-tenths compared to before. Since grain is worthless, and there is a risk of land being confiscated at any time, most property rights are in turmoil. Therefore, families with land are equal to families without land. The general psychology of people is that they would rather buy meat to eat than buy land to cultivate, and wages are more expensive than grain. Farmers all rely on farming to maintain their livelihoods, and the grain they produce is enough to eat, and they no longer hope to exchange grain for money for economic activities. Therefore, of the arable land that used to be cultivated ten qing, now only one or two qing are cultivated to maintain life. For example, in the Jidong area, only three or four counties out of fifteen counties cultivate land, and most of them grow opium. In the other counties, righteous armies gather, Japanese troops burn houses, and people all flee. It is truly as Du Fu's poem says, "(The country is broken, but the mountains and rivers remain; in the spring city, the grass and trees grow deep)." This desolate and miserable scene is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>The Educational Situation</h3>
<p>Since the Incident, all schools, regardless of size, have made Japanese language and Japanese literature the main courses. Subjects such as old history and geography are all omitted. In elementary schools, books such as the Three Character Classic, Hundred Family Surnames, and Thousand Character Classic are very popular. Middle schools mostly use classics to promote the so-called Wangdao (the Way of the Benevolent King) to cater to the old psychology and anesthetize young people. Also, a Datong College was established in Changchun to cultivate advanced enslaved talents. Those who study in this college are all teachers selected and sent by various counties. In all middle schools, Japanese people teach Japanese, nominally as teachers, but actually to supervise the words and deeds of teachers and students in the school. The topics of compositions are mainly to promote the so-called Wangdao and the co-existence and co-prosperity of Japan and Manchuria, and other opinions are not allowed to be expressed. For teachers' salaries, a method of merging schools and increasing salaries is adopted, so that the number of schools is reduced and the salaries of Japanese teachers are increased. The number of students is restricted by strict examinations, nominally to rectify education, but actually to deprive young people of places to study. Therefore, the youth of the Northeast have a great sigh of being out of school.</p>
<h3>The Political Situation</h3>
<p>The politics of the puppet organization, on the surface, Puyi went from being a puppet regent to being an emperor by usurpation, as if there was a center of gravity in politics, and everything could be decided and settled independently. In fact, since Puyi usurped the throne, even the qualification to stamp was cancelled. Everything, big and small, is controlled by Hishikari, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army. Recently, because he expressed disagreement with the publication of a certain official document, Puyi was greatly humiliated by Hishikari, and finally apologized, and expressed that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. It can be seen that it is not easy to be a puppet. As for all the measures in various counties, they are all handled by Japanese consultants, and the county magistrates are like decorations. Domestic newspapers often publish various treaties concluded between Japan and Manchuria, and the Japanese forcefully occupy certain mines, etc., which are actually scratching the surface of the matter. In reality, there is no so-called "Manchukuo." All the wealth of the Northeast is completely seized by the Japanese. Taking and demanding as they please is like entering a no-man's land. It is completely wrong for us to regard Japan and Manchuria as two different things.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Situation</h3>
<p>Since the Incident, in order to control all commerce, the Japanese have adopted the method of trusts for various enterprises and companies, forming large alliances. For example, in the shipping industry, no matter whether it is a public or private ship, it is not allowed to operate independently. There are fixed prices for transporting goods, and scheduled voyages. All expenses, staffing, and other matters are handled by the alliance association. Everything in the association is presided over by Japanese people, and the shipowners have no real power. The same is true for flour companies. Everything is regulated according to the horsepower of the machines, and shareholders are not allowed to withdraw shares or control the economy at will. Because of this, the major commercial enterprises in the Northeast, due to economic instability and social unrest, all hold the idea of reducing their scale and not seeking development. Small businesses are also of the nature of selling as soon as they arrive, and generally do not give credit. Because of the bankruptcy of the countryside, the peasants have no purchasing power at all, and there is a tendency for them not to interact with urban commercial houses. Because of this, the economic turnover is completely stalled.</p>
<h3>The Transportation Situation</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, they have actively built highways and railways in order to eliminate the righteous armies internally and consolidate national defense externally. The newly built railways are the Jidun (from Jilin to Dunhua), (Chang)Tu (from Changchun to Tumen River), Labin (from Jilin Donglafa Station to Harbin), and Beihei (from Beianzhen to Heihe). When these routes are completed in the future, they will not only facilitate military transportation, but also reduce transportation time. The righteous armies are afraid that the completion of the railways will leave them no room for activity, so they seize every opportunity to dismantle and burn road bridges, and kill road construction workers. The Japanese also use deceptive means for the laborers. For example, they explicitly stated that they would pay one yuan or one yuan and five jiao per day, but in reality, they do not pay once in several months. If there are laborers gathering to demand their salaries, they are given the crime of communist riots and massacred. Recently, in the Mishan area, the Japanese used machine guns to brutally kill more than 3,000 workers, which is a true example. Therefore, most of the previously recruited workers are scattered, and the construction of various projects is stalled. The Japanese force local households to build roads for automobiles without compensation, regardless of spring plowing and busy farming. People not only do not receive compensation, but also suffer great losses, and must bear heavier burdens. The donation for each qing of land has now increased to more than one yuan and five jiao, and everyone is complaining incessantly.</p>
<h3>Erroneous Measures</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the activities of anti-Japanese and anti-puppet elements, the Japanese ordered the police to strictly check household registrations. If residents have relatives or friends coming to stay, they must first register with the Baihu Chang (head of 100 households), otherwise, once discovered, they will be charged with harboring bandits. Those who work outside and return home must also report to the police station, otherwise they will be charged with coming and going without clear reasons. Recently, a survey of all items owned by residents, such as chickens, ducks, geese, and dogs, must be registered, and a donation of four or five jiao must be paid every month. Once registered, if there is a shortage, they will be punished. Therefore, recently, whenever police officers are heard going to the countryside to investigate, they all eat large amounts of chicken and duck meat to avoid registering and paying taxes. As the old saying goes, "(Killing chickens and dogs is not left)" is exactly the real situation in the Northeast now. In addition, all items that are completed must also be registered and restricted from transfer. Therefore, people are panicked and have a sense of insecurity.</p>
<p>All of the above shows that the compatriots in the Northeast are living in deep water and hot fire. If we do not urgently seek to recover them, then the future hidden worries are truly unimaginable. (Northeast Society)</p>

<h3>Denying Loans from England</h3>
<p>Juxingcheng's actions are unrelated to the government. Liu Xiang, the Bandit Suppression Commissioner of Sichuan, sent a telegram to Deng Mingjie, his representative stationed in Shanghai, refuting the rumor that he had borrowed money from England. The telegram stated, "(To Mr. Deng Mingjie, the report that Xiang sent Juxingcheng Bank Manager Yang Can-san as a representative to sign a contract with British capitalists is a rumor and needs to be clarified. Yang Can-san came to the province in early spring, stating that Juxing Bank planned to jointly establish a financial company with the British company Jardine Matheson, intending to use capital to develop the industry in Sichuan Province. This is a general commercial act and has nothing to do with the government. Yang requested the Headquarters to issue a passport for him to go to England to investigate industry. The Headquarters has replied in support of his intention and issued a passport, but has not entrusted Mr. Yang to sign any contract. How Juxing Bank contacts and organizes with British merchants is even more irrelevant to the Headquarters. I hereby declare it in a telegram, and I hope you will take note. Liu Xiang bowed respectfully)." Overseas Chinese in Siam Submit to the Central Government</p>
<h3>Requesting Lower Taxes on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>▲ Relieving Overseas Chinese Engaged in the Rice Industry. Bangkok Correspondence: Siam is located in the central part of the Indochina Peninsula, between Annam and Burma, with an area of approximately 195,000 square miles and a population of approximately 9 million. Since Annam was lost to France and Burma to England, Siam has been able to maintain its sovereignty and become an independent and autonomous country because it is located between the colonial territories of the two major powers, England and France, which mutually restrain each other. The terrain of Siam is mountainous in the northwest, and the central and southern parts are a large plain. Because it is located in the tropics, the climate is mild, and the inland rainfall is abundant, it is very suitable for rice cultivation. Therefore, rice is the largest product, with an average annual output of more than 1.3 million tons, worth no less than 50 million yuan. Approximately 2.5 million overseas Chinese reside in this land, accounting for nearly one-third of the total population, holding the commercial power of the country, and many are engaged in rice cultivation. The rice produced is imported into our country every year in a large amount. However, in recent years, on the one hand, due to the overproduction of food in the world, it is dumped into our country. On the other hand, due to the consecutive years of bumper harvests in the Yangtze River area of our country, the prices of agricultural products have plummeted, and the rural economy of our country is almost bankrupt. The government of our country has no choice but to levy import taxes on foreign rice. However, since the implementation of this tax, Siamese rice exports have been severely hit, and the economy of overseas Chinese in Siam has also been affected. Recently, the north and south provinces of our country have suffered from floods and droughts, and domestic rice prices have risen. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Siam, in order to save people and save themselves, convened its tenth executive committee meeting in the meeting hall the day before yesterday, and passed a motion to request the Nanjing Central Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government to reduce the import tax on foreign rice as much as possible, so that the impoverished overseas Chinese in Siam can benefit from it, and use it to relieve the domestic food panic. I wonder if our government can accept this request.</p>
<h3>Causes of the Breach in Changyuan</h3>
<p>There are five reasons for the breach; the levee in Hua County is also in danger. Kaifeng Correspondence: On the 15th, the water level in Shaanxi Prefecture was 292.16 meters, down 4.3 centimeters yesterday (14th). The water level at the Pinghan Railway Bridge was 94.96 meters, down 1.4 centimeters from yesterday. The water level at Heigang rose about 1 centimeter from yesterday. The water situation is stable, but bandit remnants have infiltrated the southern section of Dongming and Kaocheng, and the flood control personnel are all in danger. Once a major flood arrives, I am afraid that no one will dare to rush to the rescue because of the bandits. The following is a record of the causes of the breach in Changyuan and the water situation in Hua County. ▲ Causes of the Breach: He Youliang, engineer of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission stationed in Changyuan, reported to Chen Ruzhen, director of the River Defense Group of the commission, on the 15th, reporting the situation and causes of the breach: The levee works at the northern section of Gates No. 17, 8, 25, and 21 collapsed one after another after midday. The breach at No. 17 is about 120 meters wide, and No. 8 is also 120 meters wide, No. 25 is 130 meters wide, and No. 21 is 100 meters wide. Dozens of villages in Changyuan have been flooded. There are about five reasons for the breach: (1) There are many string ditches above Menggang, and the flow of the ditches is blocked by the small embankment built by the Gongzhen Group in Menggang, making it difficult to discharge. The backflow then impacted the new embankment in the Shiche section. (2) The soil quality of the new embankment contains more mud and less soil. The water ditches and wave nests were not filled firmly, and the embankment protection project was not built. Moreover, the base of each original gate was not strong, the embankment body was depressed, and the gaps leaked, leading to collapse. (3) During the flood prevention period, it was customary to build a shed every two miles on the north and south embankments, which was guarded by 12 laborers. However, this time, they did not go to the embankment to perform their duties. (4) There were too many loopholes. Although the original gates No. 12, 13, 14, and 19 were rushed to block, they were not able to take care of all of them, which eventually led to collapse. (5) There was a lack of materials and it was not possible to take preventive measures in advance. Once there was an emergency, they were at a loss. As for the breach blocking project, the first priority is to hang silt, and use burlap bags to fill the loopholes. After the water recedes, earthwork will be started. The work of hanging silt and filling holes has already begun. The Laoan Dike of Xiaopang Village and Hua County also experienced danger on the evening of the day before yesterday, but fortunately, they were quickly rushed and blocked, and they were restored to normal. ▲ Water Situation in Hua County: According to the River Affairs Bureau, Engineer Hao of Laoan Dike in Hua County telegraphed on the 15th (14th), reporting that since the breach at Jiugulu in Changyuan, the water level there has continued to rise. At 12 o'clock last night, the water was only four or five centimeters away from the top of the dike. At dawn, the water passed through holes in the thin part of the dike at the northern end, and the holes were as large as basins, which was extremely dangerous. He immediately led the staff to rush to block it with Mr. Xie, the county magistrate, and put down a lot of sweeps, which finally closed it and prevented danger. Also, according to a deleted telegram from Xie Suian, the magistrate of Hua County, after the breach at Menggang Wenyuan in Jiugulu, Changyuan, the water flooded more than 60 villages in the county and became a disaster. He has ordered each district to quickly build two diversion embankments to prevent flooding. It is also heard that the water in the upper reaches of the Yellow River will continue to rise. The county magistrate has met with Engineer Hao to lead the district chiefs and laborers on the dike to rush to protect it at midnight, and also prayed to directly telegraph Engineer Hao to purchase materials for rushing to repair the dike to avoid delays, etc. (15th).

<h3>Qing Province Administrative Situation</h3>
<p>Qing Province is vast and sparsely populated, with a complex ethnic composition. On average, there is only one person for every 2.4 square miles. It is more difficult to administer policies and issue orders than in other provinces in the interior. The Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the province, Tan Kemin, gave a detailed account of the civil affairs situation. According to him, there are 15 counties in the province. The organization of these counties varies depending on the complexity of the administrative affairs. Some have one or two sections, while others have only a general affairs section. The four bureaus of public security, finance, construction, and education have been reorganized into sections for management, while others have not yet been established. The administrative expenses of the counties are estimated to be 950 yuan per month for first-class counties, 650 yuan for second-class counties, and 540 yuan for third-class counties. However, the four counties of Qilian, Tongren, Gonghe, and Dulan receive only 400 yuan per month due to insufficient income, which is allocated by the Finance Department. The recurring expenses of each bureau and section, except for the Education Bureau, which has a fund for interest or is paid from school rent and tax grain, the Finance and Construction Bureaus have no fixed expenses, or have not been established, or apply to the county government for temporary expenses. Public Security Bureaus have only been established in twelve or thirteen counties throughout the province. For example, Dulan, Tongren, Nangqian, and other counties have not been established due to lack of funds. The counties where public security bureaus have been established have a total of 478 police officers and 24 police chiefs and trainers. The annual cost of salaries, clothing, etc. is 44,610 yuan. Only Yushu County is allowed to pay from tax revenue, and the rest is levied on the people. Most county governments also handle civil and criminal lawsuits, and those with serious circumstances are transferred to the local court or high court for handling. Both courts are located in the provincial capital. When the Mongol and Tibetan people, who live in concentrated areas, have disputes, it is difficult to punish them according to the law, and they must be dealt with according to the Mongol and Tibetan rules. The population of the province is difficult to survey due to the mixed ethnic groups and the nomadic way of life of the Mongol and Tibetan people. According to the survey conducted in the 19th year, including temples and lamas, the total is 1,056,072 people. Han people account for 390,279 people, Hui people 118,822 people, Tibetan people 181,476 people, Mongol people 23,885 people, Guoluo 200,000 people (?), native people 51,723 people, and other tens of thousands of people. On average, there is only one person for every 2.4 square miles. There are no detailed surveys of their distribution, types of occupations, or the number of old, young, sick, and disabled. There are currently 12 counties designated as autonomous regions, with a total of 47 districts. District offices have been established in all of them. In the 20th year, they were allowed to prepare for the establishment of district chief training centers in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry of the Interior. Students were selected by each county and sent to the centers for training. A total of more than 30 students have graduated and been assigned to positions. The expenses were originally scheduled to be allocated from tax revenue, but this was difficult to achieve due to insufficient tax revenue. This has prevented the project from developing as planned. The provincial capital originally had organizations such as orphanages, charitable associations, Tongshan Public Office, relief agencies, and Yinli Bureau for relief work, but they were all in name only. It was not until the winter of the 20th year that all the old relief agencies were merged and the Qinghai Relief Institute was established in accordance with the relief institute rules issued by the Ministry of the Interior. The institute was divided into six sections: old-age homes, orphanages, infant care centers, disability centers, medical assistance centers, and loan centers. In addition to using the original funds, other funds were also allocated and temporary donations were collected to maintain the current situation. Qing Province is located on the border, with frequent droughts and lack of education, and it is difficult to make a living. Therefore, there are many poor, sick, and disabled people. In order to save the race and stabilize society, efforts are being made to enrich the interior. Unfortunately, due to the limited provincial treasury, this cannot be done in the short term. Before the establishment of the province, the seven counties under Xining, except for Huangyuan, Datong, and Bayong, which are high and cold and not suitable for planting opium poppies, could all be planted. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, all the roads in Gansu relied on planting opium to raise military funds. The opium produced in Xining Road reached more than 7 million taels, and the opium acreage collected about 200,000 taels. Ma Ji, the garrison envoy of Ninghai, Gansu, used planting opium to raise funds. Although it supplemented the finances, it was like drinking poison to quench thirst, which was not a way to strengthen the country. Therefore, he suggested that the authorities strictly order the seven counties under Xining Road to prohibit planting across the board, and to permanently eliminate the poisonous plants. It has been 19 years since then. However, due to the proximity to the opium areas of Ganzhou and Liangzhou, unscrupulous merchants secretly sell them. Special penalties are stipulated to prohibit them in the levy. Since the establishment of the province, although the financial situation has been extremely difficult, the spirit of banning opium, which has been consistent for more than ten years, has not been relaxed. The social granaries have accumulated grain in all counties, with a total of 19 warehouses and more than 10,348 stones of grain, 4,250 yuan in foreign currency, and 1,000 taels of silver. Among them, the Fengli Yicang was established by Liu Xiaolan, a gentry in Lanzhou, who donated funds. It has benefited the local area and is truly not superficial. Regarding sanitation matters, a civilian hospital was initially established in the provincial capital at the time of the establishment of the province. It was later renamed Zhongshan Hospital. The provincial treasury allocated 3,000 yuan per month, with 2,000 yuan for staff salaries and 1,000 yuan for medicine expenses. Due to inconvenient transportation, it took time to purchase medicines from Tianjin and Shanghai, and the funds were limited, so it was not possible to purchase and store much. There was often a sense of insufficient supply. As for patients in remote counties, because the road was far away and they lacked the strength, the number of people who had to give up their hopes was even greater. Now, in order to enrich the hospital's medical equipment and prepare for the establishment of branch hospitals in various places, funds are needed everywhere, which is not something that the province's financial resources can afford. Fortunately, Song Ziwen came to Qing Province for inspection and made detailed plans for Qing Province's sanitation, animal husbandry, and highways, etc., as the initial basis for developing the Northwest. It is seen that from Shaanxi and Longdong to Qinghai, it will not be difficult to implement them one by one. Qinghai is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and the terrain is high and cold, averaging about 10,000 feet above sea level. Rainfall is scarce, and every summer, when strong winds rise, hailstorms arrive, injuring crops and killing livestock, which are often heard of. Therefore, the fear of hailstorms in the counties and villages is even greater than that of poisonous snakes and wild beasts. In order to salvage the situation, it is necessary to quickly plant forests on barren mountains and open fields to regulate the climate. This may be able to help.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Disaster in Southern Guangdong</h3>
<p>Hundreds of houses collapsed in Fangcheng County, and transportation was cut off. The county of Hepu was ravaged by wind and rain, and agricultural crops were lost. Guangdong News: Fangcheng County in Qinzhou, Southern District, is located near the Gulf of Tonkin. After the flood last month, a typhoon occurred again on July 28. The typhoon arrived at about 1:00 p.m. that day. Its momentum was unprecedented in decades. For a time, the sound of collapsing houses, the cries for help from residents, and the roaring wind echoed each other, which was particularly tragic. Then the wind became more violent, the wooden rafts sank, and the houses collapsed. In the first half of the night, all the roof tiles in the county were swept away by the typhoon. Even in the county seat, only a few buildings such as the Fangcheng Consumer Cooperative and the public hospital have been able to preserve their roof tiles slightly. The rest have no roof tiles left on their backs. The Fangcheng County Government Office also collapsed completely, and a part of the county prison was also blown down. The prisoners took the opportunity to escape, but were fortunately captured by the county soldiers. All the buildings, trees, flowers, and fruits in Bonan Park in the city were destroyed. Zhongshan Park and the Middle School were also partially damaged. More than 80 civilian houses were completely collapsed, killing five people and injuring more than ten. More than 300 houses collapsed in the villages attached to the city, and more than half of the houses collapsed in Maoling Town, with dozens of deaths and injuries. All the crops in the villages have been destroyed. The wind slowed down slightly late at night, but it was followed by rain. The refugees had nowhere to live, and the entire county's roadbed was submerged in water. Telephones and wired telegraphs were cut off due to broken lines and broken poles, cutting off transportation. The next day (29th), all sectors organized an emergency relief association and established a refugee shelter in the County Hospital. The injured were treated, and funeral expenses were paid for the dead. The refugees were temporarily housed and fed in the shelter. At the same time, the consumer cooperative sent personnel to neighboring areas to rush to purchase building materials such as bricks and tiles, and sold them at their original value to facilitate the repair and construction of houses. As for the losses of the entire county, it is difficult to estimate at the moment. Also, since the beginning of summer, there has been more rain and less sunshine in Hepu County. On the 9th and 10th of last month, there was torrential rain. The entire Jianan store outside the West Gate collapsed, killing a worker. On the 28th, there was intermittent rain. From 8:00 a.m. on the 29th, a strong wind suddenly arrived, accompanied by heavy rain, which lasted for a day and a night before it stopped. After the investigation, a newly built civilian house collapsed on Binlang Street in the city, 4 or 5 zhang of the A wall of Zhongshan Park collapsed, a part of the city wall at Xiaonanmen collapsed, the city tower at Ximen was also about to collapse, and an ancient house at Shuidongkou completely collapsed. The newly built roadbed from Hepu to Qinxian, and other road surfaces, have been washed away by the water, and the bridges have been washed away. The early rice that had not been harvested was all submerged in water, and even the harvested ears of rice sprouted due to the rain, and the farmers all cried out in pain. (14th)</p>
<h3>Natural Disasters and Man-Made Calamities in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Thirty-three Counties Affected by Flood and Drought Disasters. Seven Counties Along the River Ravaged by Bandits. A Dispatch from Guiyang: Disasters have been frequent in Guizhou Province in recent years, with cries of misery heard everywhere. Although the provincial government and various disaster relief agencies have provided aid in many ways, due to the vast disaster area and financial exhaustion, the assistance is too slow to be effective. The affected areas are filled with bandits, and the people's suffering is visible everywhere. Recently, more than forty counties in various disaster-stricken areas have petitioned the provincial government and disaster relief agencies for urgent assistance. The disaster area covers half of the province, and the severity of the disaster exceeds the record of the past sixty years. Wang Jialie, Chairman of Guizhou Province, considering the urgency of the situation, has repeatedly convened the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, and the Bandit Suppression Support Association, etc., to raise funds for relief according to the severity of the disaster in different regions. He also petitioned the Executive Yuan Relief Committee to quickly allocate a large sum of money to relieve the disaster victims. The text reads: (Respectfully addressed to the Executive Yuan Relief Committee in Nanjing: Since the beginning of summer, the weather in Guizhou Province has been abnormally cold and hot, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. According to reports from Tongren, Jiangkou, Zhenyuan, Shengxi, Sansui, Songtao, Cengong, Tianzhu, Shibing, Huangping, Taigong, Jinping, and other twelve counties, floods have inundated the area, and countless people, livestock, fields, and houses have been submerged. According to reports from Zhenning, Guanling, Tongzi, Lushan, Danjiang, Weining, Pingba, Qianxi, and other eight counties, hailstorms have caused severe damage to houses and crops. According to reports from Zhenyuan, Renhuai, and Rongjiang, drought has caused crop failure and food shortages. According to reports from Dujiang, Jianhe, Yongcong, Guiding, Bijie, Xingren, Tongzi, Lushan, Sinan, and other nine counties, towns and villages have been repeatedly struck by fire, leaving people homeless. The above thirty-three counties have suffered natural disasters. In addition, seven counties bordering Sichuan and Hunan, including Yanhe, Houping, Wuchuan, Zhengan, Songtao, and Yinjiang, have been harassed by the bandits led by He, which is even more devastating. The unprecedented catastrophe is deeply heartbreaking. I, Jialie, have repeatedly convened the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Branch, and the Bandit Suppression Support Association to hold meetings to discuss and properly plan relief measures. It is generally believed that Guizhou Province is impoverished and financially exhausted, and it is difficult to raise funds. In addition to reviewing the urgency and importance of the situation at any time and providing some relief from the provincial government or ordering local governments to raise funds locally to alleviate the immediate needs, it is essential to allocate a large sum of relief money to Guizhou to save the remaining people. I am awaiting orders with utmost urgency. Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government, bows with respect.) Taicang</p>
<h3>Sister-in-Law and Brother-in-Law Commit Adultery and Poison Wife to Death</h3>
<p>Zhu Yongfu from Liuhe is currently working as a partner in a rice shop in Hongkou, Shanghai. He married a woman named Fang, but the couple did not get along very well. Wang has a widowed sister-in-law named Yu, who also lives in Shanghai. It is rumored that the brother-in-law and sister-in-law were having an affair. Fang took advantage of the agricultural slack season the other day to go to Shanghai to find her husband, Liu. Yongfu went home with Fang and spent the night with her. The next morning, Fang suddenly died. Her skin was blue and purple. Her father, Fang Bosheng, reported the case to the county government. Shen, the investigator, went to Liuhe to examine the body. He found that the deceased's ribs were blue, and her fingers were also blue. When a silver needle was inserted into her upper and lower orifices, it turned black upon removal. It was determined that she died of poison. Wang Yongfu was taken to the county for investigation. Songjiang</p>
<h3>Murder Case in Lita Hui Yuehuo</h3>
<p>Lu Yaoyuan, a farmer from Dongyejike, Lita Hui, was from a well-to-do family. The other night, six bandits armed with guns suddenly broke into his house. Yaoyuan, knowing he was being robbed, was startled awake and rushed out the back door, only to be shot in a vital spot by a bandit guarding the back door, falling to the ground and dying on the spot. The bandits, in a panic, scattered with their loot. Lu and his wife, both 56 years old, are now in mourning. The deceased's death is tragic, and the survivor has not yet reported the case to the authorities for investigation. Wuxi</p>
<h3>Provincial Department Strives for Thirty Million in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently decided to issue 30 million in public bonds to develop water conservancy and reorganize old and new debts, and stipulated the uses as: (1) Reorganizing old and new debts; (2) Completing the Huai River diversion project; (3) Dredging the new canal. The measures and detailed rules had already been drafted and submitted to the central government and the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. However, the central government, considering that Jiangsu Province has suffered from consecutive years of disasters, the market is depressed, and the people are still in distress, intends to change the bond amount to 10 million yuan. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the planned projects are all urgent political priorities that need to be implemented in the province and cannot be further reduced. Yesterday, Yu Jingtang and Zhao Dihua, the directors of the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, went to Beijing together to explain the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province to the central government and insisted on realizing the plan.</p>
<h3>Escalation of the Huangweiba Incident</h3>
<p>The dispute over the Huangweiba embankment in Chenshu, Sixth District of this county, remains unresolved between Wuxi and Cheng County. Both sides have filed petitions with the Construction Department, which ordered engineer Wang Yuanxi to be responsible for the investigation and verification. After receiving the order, engineer Wang went to Cheng County from Zhen on the afternoon of the other day to meet with Magistrate Bao. On the morning of the day before yesterday, he met with Yang Jianxun, the technician of the county, and Huang Shide, the chief of the Fifth District, to conduct an investigation. The investigation was completed at 10:00 AM, and they prepared to go to Gushan to discuss a solution. Unexpectedly, Zhou Weisan, the mayor of Gushan Town, led more than a thousand villagers, holding carrying poles, winnows, iron hoes, and other farming tools, swarming to the embankment and completely dismantling the embankment base. Although engineer Wang tried to dissuade them, it was to no avail. Chenshu townsmen, to avoid conflict, did not resist at that time and allowed them to dig. Afterwards, Chenshu Town Mayor Zhou Zixiao, in addition to reporting the situation to Zhao Yingqiu, the chief of the Sixth District, who forwarded it to the county government for verification, also urgently telegraphed the Construction Department, requesting that Wuxi and Cheng counties be ordered to use force to stop the action, so as to maintain the original state, and requested punishment for Zhou Weisan, the mayor of Gushan Town. At the same time, he sent Yao Hongshou, a representative, to the city to petition the Construction Bureau of the county government, requesting that the matter be handled impartially. Magistrate Yan then instructed Yao to convey to Mayor Zhou to advise the villagers of Chenshu not to escalate the incident and to wait for engineer Wang to report the investigation situation to the Construction Department and wait for the department's verification. Yao left after receiving the instructions. Yesterday morning (the 18th), engineer Wang had already arrived in Wuxi from Cheng County and stayed at No. 53 Qitai Inn. The reporter, upon hearing the news, went to visit and asked about the incident of the villagers of Gushan dismantling the embankment. According to him, the reason why the villagers of Gushan dismantled the Chenshu embankment base this time was that the water volume in the canal on the Gushan side was too shallow. Recently, water lifting machines have been used day and night to lift water, resulting in an even shallower water volume. In terms of drought relief, there is an urgent need to increase the water volume, but the bottom of the Gushan River is very high. Dismantling the embankment may not necessarily increase the benefits in terms of water conservancy. As for transportation, it is not discussed in the context of drought relief. The current solution should be for the two counties of Wuxi and Cheng to convene all relevant parties to discuss the disposal. Yesterday, the villagers of Gushan relied on the crowd to dismantle the embankment, and the dispute escalated. This kind of responsibility should be borne by the district chief and mayor of Cheng County. At that time, I was on the scene trying to dissuade and mediate, but due to the seriousness of the situation, it was difficult to start. I need to report to the Construction Department for verification and decision. At 12:39, engineer Wang took the Shanghai-Nanjing express train to Zhen to report the situation of the Huangweiba investigation and the truth about the illegal demolition of the embankment by the villagers of Gushan to Director Shen for verification, and it was decided to come to Wuxi again today. As for the above dispute, it was originally a dispute over emotions, and the situation has become a stalemate. It is feared that it will be difficult to resolve in the short term. At present, Chenshu intends to wait for the department to handle it, but it is said that the villagers of Gushan had submitted an application to the Construction Department before dismantling the embankment. Now the Construction Department knows that the embankment should not be demolished, so it decided to change the original plan, but this kind of unfortunate event has already been caused. Changzhou</p>
<h3>Magistrate Cai Prepares to Hand Over</h3>
<p>Cai Pei, the magistrate of Wuyi County, has repeatedly requested to resign, but has not been granted permission. Recently, he has been seeking medical treatment due to illness and has again firmly requested to resign. The provincial government has not yet approved the order to Chang, according to the report. It is rumored that this time it is hoped to be approved. Yesterday (the 17th), the provincial government meeting indeed proposed to approve the resignation of Cai Pei, the magistrate of Wujin County, and the vacancy will be filled by Hou Zong, the most qualified candidate from the selection. Magistrate Cai, upon hearing the news, ordered the department to handle the handover of various items long ago, and only needs the new magistrate to come to Chang at any time to be able to hand over everything clearly. It is also heard that the new magistrate, Hou Zong, is 35 years old and from Hunan. He has served as the magistrate of Longshan, Pingjiang, and Yueyang counties in Hunan. He is currently still serving as the magistrate of Yueyang County and must hand over before coming to Chang to take office. Changshu</p>
<h3>Young Daughter of Wealthy Family Kidnapped by Bandits</h3>
<p>Qian Lisan, a wealthy household in Tangjiaqiao, Xitang City, is 53 years old. He has four daughters. The eldest daughter, Qian Quan, currently works for the county government. The second daughter, Yunhui, is the principal of Wangzhuang Elementary School. The third and fourth daughters are studying elsewhere. Because he had no sons, he took a concubine two years ago, who gave birth to a son, named Shoubao, who is now six years old. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 17th, before dawn, more than twenty bandits suddenly came, with eight entering and the rest guarding the front and back. The eldest and second daughters, who happened to be at home, heard the bandit alarm and fortunately escaped by taking the opportunity. After looting valuables, the bandits went to Qian's concubine's room and kidnapped the young child Shoubao. Before leaving, they left a letter saying that within three days, 50,000 silver dollars should be brought to the Fushan Teahouse to contact someone holding a long dry tobacco pipe. The Qian family has reported the case to the county government for investigation and rescue of the hostage. The loss this time, in addition to the kidnapped child, includes 600 silver dollars in cash and clothing, etc., totaling more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Magistrate Resignation Approved</h3>
<p>Zhou Heng, the magistrate of this county, has been in Chang for more than a year. Recently, the matter of Tu Fan Jia Boqin's bribery of 3,000 yuan has been exposed. The provincial government has filed a charge, and it has been handed over to the Zhenjiang Court for trial. The magistrate's brother, Zhou Fuchen, and nephew, Zhou Xiejun, are all important figures in this case and have been detained by the Zhenjiang Court. The magistrate's affair has expanded, and he suddenly developed the intention to retire, and repeatedly submitted his resignation. On the 17th, the provincial government meeting approved it, and Zhai Xing was appointed to replace him. Now the county government here, because it was already prepared, immediately handled the handover procedures.</p>
<h3>Notorious Bandit Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>Wanlv Township, Eighth District, was looted by lake bandits last month, with as many as twenty-two families being robbed. It is learned that Ruan Weijun, the captain of the Third Water Police Team, was informed that this case was committed by Tang San, the leader of the Shuihuobang bandits. He immediately led the police and informants to Suzhou and requested assistance from the Third Water Police Department. As a result, Tang San was captured in that area, and Chen Jinkui (Chen Mu Ji Zi), a notorious bandit from Taihu Lake, was also arrested. He can be returned to this county for investigation on the same day. Yangzhou</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Sends Team to Protect Yang-Liu Road</h3>
<p>The construction of Culvert No. 141 on the Mei Jiagou Yang-Liu Road at the Jiangyin-Yizheng border was originally for one meter. The local villagers, due to the impact on farmland irrigation, caused a trend of demolishing the dam. Later, it was changed to two meters, and two additional culvert pipes were installed at Culvert No. 18. However, the local villagers still believed that the water flow of the Mei Jiagou Yue River was insufficient and demolished the dam again, and smashed the waterwheel, and the loss of cement dam base piles and pine and cypress trees was enormous. After submitting to the Construction Department for verification, the provincial government specially sent sixty members of the security team to protect the area the other day. The project has now been suspended. Jiaxing</p>
<h3>Jia-Shen Cargo Ship Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>The cargo ship from Jiaxing to Shendang, when sailing from Jiaxing to Shendang yesterday, sailed to several miles south of Yuxian Dai, at 1:00 PM. Suddenly, many bandits came from the pond bank, holding guns, and ordered the ship to stop. The shipowner, Zhou Long, was alert and took the opportunity to go ashore (carrying more than 1,000 yuan in silver notes). After the bandits boarded the ship, they rummaged through the cargo. Because no silver dollars were found, they beat the crew members indiscriminately, causing three injuries. After the bandits left, the ship started sailing and arrived in Shendang at midnight. It was fortunate that the inspection loss was still slight. Gaochun</p>
<p>Severe Drought Needs Relief Urgently. Since last autumn, there have been only a few light rains in this county throughout the year. Mountain ponds and shores have long been dry. Fields not planted account for three-tenths of the disaster-affected fields (estimated to be more than 200,000 mu of disaster-affected fields). Those that have been planted have all withered and yellowed one after another. The Xu River, from Xiaba through Liyang to Wuxi, has also dried up early. Although there are several earthen wells, they are all silted and shallow with no water. Drinking water is also in great panic. In the past month, more than 30,000 disaster victims have been migrating to Xuancheng and Dangtu counties in Anhui to seek food and drink. The elderly and young who have died of starvation and heatstroke and those who have been abandoned have reached more than 700 people so far. Chickens, geese, and ducks cost less than 100 copper coins per catty, and pigs, cattle, and sheep are only worth 100 copper coins per catty. The situation of selling along the streets is tragic. The trees in the four townships have been completely felled, and barren mountains and red land are shocking to the eye. In the northeastern townships near Langxi and Liyang, incidents of robbing rice for food and kidnapping and killing have been common. Although the County Drought Relief Association has tried to provide relief, the disaster is heavy and the funds are insufficient, which is of no avail. Therefore, the association has submitted a petition to the government and various charitable organizations to provide relief. Nantong</p>
<h3>Change of Head of Provincial Water Police Team</h3>
<p>Chen Xin, the leader of the 13th Team of the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Bureau, stationed in Tonghai Chang, has been dismissed by the Department of Civil Affairs. Qiu Xiangfeng has been appointed to replace him. The handover will take place on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan North Begins Trial Talk</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Jiangnan North long-distance telephone has been connected between Jiangyin and Jingjiang. Since the 17th, the counties in Jiangnan North have started trial talks, and the results are very good. Formal calls will begin on September 1st. Haimen</p>
<h3>Water Police Inspector Accused</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs previously received a report from Gong Zhuoqu, Shi Bin, and Shi of the Fourth District of this county, accusing Huang Tieshi, a water police inspector of Lingdian Port, of manufacturing and selling opium pills. Wang Guobin, an investigator sent by the department, came to Hai to investigate and reported that there was still little evidence for the manufacturing part of the water police inspector Huang Tieshi's production of opium pills, and the two parts of transportation and smoking opium pills were not without reason. Shi Bin and Shi Gengzhai used private litigation, and usually lived by writing lawsuits, obviously bad elements. Yesterday, Zhang County Magistrate was ordered to bring the water police inspector Huang Tieshi to trial according to law, and arrest Shi Bin and Shi, both to investigate and handle the case, in order to warn against unscrupulous customs.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<p>Surging outflow of silver</p>
<h3>Silver community in this city meets to discuss remedial measures</h3>
<p>Thorough consultation on the third floor of the Central Bank last night. Leaders of important Chinese banks in this city all participated.</p>
<h3>Hope that the government will quickly promulgate countermeasures to reduce the panic in the silver market</h3>
<p>Shishi News Agency: After the US increased the price of silver, the Shanghai silver market has recently shown a surge of outflow, which has caused a major panic in China's silver market. The banking community in this city, in order to stabilize the market, held a meeting on the third floor of the Central Bank on the night of the 17th. Leaders of important banks all participated in the discussion and consultation on remedial measures, hoping that the government would quickly determine countermeasures for the silver crisis, in order to prevent the continued large outflow of silver. A detailed report is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Surging outflow of silver market panic</h3>
<p>Since US President Roosevelt vigorously implemented the silver policy and nationalized silver, the price of silver has been rising steadily. The price of silver in the two silver market centers of New York and London has exceeded the price in Shanghai. In order to implement its policy, the United States still has a huge demand for silver and continues to absorb it from abroad. Therefore, foreign banks in this city and a small part of Chinese banks are taking advantage of the profit, making a big profit, and transporting the silver stored in the country in large quantities through Mumbai and London, and transferring it to New York. From January to July this year, the silver surplus has reached 60 million, and the amount transported out this month has also reached 15 million. Because all parties have heard that the government is about to decide on countermeasures, silver exports will be even more enthusiastic. Foreign banks such as McGary, HSBC, Citibank, and Zhengjin will continue to have large quantities of silver loaded for export in the near future. Recently, a panic state has formed in the silver market.</p>
<h3>The silver community meets to discuss remedial measures</h3>
<p>In the past one or two days, although this kind of large-scale outflow of silver may not have a significant impact on the foundation of China's finance and industry in the short term, it will inevitably cause extreme unrest in China's domestic financial market in the long run. The banking community in this city, for its own self-interest and to stabilize the current silver market, held a meeting on the third floor of the Central Bank on the Bund from 7:00 PM on the night of the 17th to exchange opinions and discuss recent measures to prevent the large outflow of silver, and the unified attitude that Chinese banks should take. Each of the main points was thoroughly discussed for several hours. Participants included Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Chen Guangfu of the Shanghai Bank, Chen Hang of the Central Bank, Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, Jin Guobao, Xu Xinliu of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Wu Yunzhai of Jincheng Bank, and heads of foreign exchange departments of major banks. All senior officials participated in the discussion.</p>
<h3>Eagerly awaiting the government to determine countermeasures</h3>
<p>The content of the meeting was kept secret by all parties concerned afterward. According to the results of inquiries, it was learned that the main purpose of the banking community meeting was to discuss a specific opinion and contribute to the government, eagerly awaiting the early determination of countermeasures. The silver community, in view of the daily large outflow of silver, the main reason lies in the increase in the price of silver in the United States. However, our government has not implemented any effective remedial measures. Generally, foreign banks are afraid that the government will suddenly have policies to prohibit or increase tax rates. In order to make heavy profits, the outflow of silver has increased even more. Therefore, if the government can immediately determine remedial methods, this degree of panic can be expected to decrease, and the outflow of silver can be reduced. In addition, there was also a detailed discussion on the government's future measures such as increasing silver tax and prohibiting silver exports, and opinions will be prepared for the government's reference.</p>
<h3>Bei Songsun talks about temporary calmness</h3>
<p>The Shishi News Agency reporter asked Mr. Bei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, for his opinion yesterday. According to Mr. Bei, the reason for gathering the leaders of the banking industry this time is that the recent outflow of silver has been excessive, and a part of it is quite panic. Therefore, a special gathering was held to talk and exchange opinions on the current situation and discuss it. According to his personal opinion, the recent large outflow of silver does have some unfavorable trends for our country. However, it will not form how excessively bad a level at present. China still has a lot of silver in stock. Since the European War, there has been a large amount of silver entering every year. For a while, there will not be any terrible impact. Therefore, we should remain calm temporarily, set policies to deal with it, and seek fundamental relief. It is useless to disturb oneself in vain, and it will not help the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou talks about close relations</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, the US's increase in the price of silver and the increasing outflow of our silver are obvious facts. The administrative procedures of the Banking Association have not yet made a formal decision on this issue. As for the recent meeting and discussion among major Chinese banks, it is necessary because of close self-interest. The meeting resulted in some contributions and decisions on prevention and remedial measures. Although China's silver has had a large trade surplus in the past, if measures are not taken to stop it and it is allowed to flow out for a long time, there will inevitably be a shortage in the future. At that time, it will inevitably cause difficulties in finance and economy. Therefore, it is an urgent matter to devise ways to rescue the situation in advance. According to the Continental Newspaper.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Cotton and Wheat Loan</h3>
<p>Wheat is sold to Chinese flour mills. US cotton buyers are Japanese merchants. According to the Continental Newspaper, the disposal of the US-China cotton and wheat loan of US$50 million (later reduced to US$20 million) has been painstaking. Now, it is about to be completed. All cotton and wheat purchased with the loan, except for a small batch that is currently en route, have been transported to China. This wheat is managed by Mr. Peck of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee. According to Mr. Peck, the amount of American wheat arriving in Shanghai, including the 9,420 tons that just arrived in port, is 308,401 tons. The last two batches, totaling 14,837 tons, are currently en route to Shanghai and will arrive soon. Of the 308,401 tons that have arrived, 900 tons were sold in Qingdao, 12,000 tons were sold in Nanjing, and the remaining 281,401 tons were sold in Shanghai. The buyers are all Chinese flour mills, and the average price is four yuan per dan. The wheat part of the US loan, according to the revised contract, is US$6 million, or 313,238 tons of wheat. The cotton part accounts for US$10 million, and the remaining US$4 million is used to purchase flour. As for American cotton, because the market situation is not as good as wheat, a large part of the goods that have arrived have not been sold. According to Xu, the general manager of the Central Bank, and Bassi, the consultant of the Central Bank, who represent the government in Shanghai to manage the cotton and wheat loan, the publication of the details of American cotton under the current market conditions is more harmful than beneficial. Mr. Bassi also specifically explained that Japanese buyers are now the major buyers of American cotton, so they are very concerned about the American cotton market. If the development of the American cotton market is published too early, it is feared that it will be used by the Japanese. According to reports, the last batch of 2,975 bales of American cotton was shipped from the United States on July 1, so the goods must have arrived in Shanghai now. Mr. Xu mentioned the sales situation of American cotton after its arrival, citing the words of Song Ziwen at the meeting of the National Economic Council in Beijing on March 26, that a total of 50,000 bales of American cotton have been sold, earning 750,000 yuan. According to the market price at that time, the remaining cotton can be sold for 15 million yuan. Mr. Xu continued that after Mr. Song's report, there was not much progress in the sale of American cotton. As for the American flour of 4 million US dollars, it was decided not to buy it because the price was not suitable. This was also decided at the last meeting of the National Economic Council. The principle that the funds obtained from the sale of American cotton and wheat should be used exclusively for construction projects will be strictly followed, and the distribution method is at the discretion of the central government.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Returns to Shanghai from Beijing for a Brief Talk</h3>
<p>Xinjiang Civil Strife Suppressed. The Fifth National Congress is Expected to Open. Huang Fu's Return to the North is Undetermined. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, Zou Lin, Vice Minister of Finance, and others, arrived in Shanghai by the night express train from Beijing at 7:30 yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went straight to his private residence on Albert Road to rest. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency visited Mr. Chu at his private residence yesterday and inquired about the situation. A separate report is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Prince Arrives in Beijing to Report to Wang</h3>
<p>Mr. Chu first stated that Prince Minzhu Cewang Dorje of the Torghut of Xinjiang has now arrived in Beijing from Ping. The prince entered Tibet in 1932 and stayed there for a long time, so he is quite familiar with the situation in all aspects and can speak fluent Chinese. He is scheduled to meet with President Wang on the morning of the 18th to report on the political situation in Tibet and Xinjiang. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission will give him a grand reception to express their welcome. The prince is scheduled to stay in Beijing for a short time before going to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Lin and visit Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and then set off to return to Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>The War in Xinjiang Province Has Now Been Suppressed</h3>
<p>Continuing to talk about the Xinjiang Construction Committee, which has not held a meeting for a long time. The war in Xinjiang Province has now been suppressed, and the local area is also becoming safer. Ma Zhongying fled to Russia after a disastrous defeat, with only 83 followers. All of them were disarmed by the Russian army. Although Xinjiang Province has requested extradition from the Russian side, the Russian side refused extradition on the pretext that Ma and others were political prisoners. However, after Ma fled to Russia, the local area in Xinjiang became increasingly stable.</p>
<h3>Currently Carrying Out Recovery and Construction</h3>
<p>Regarding the post-war reconstruction in Xinjiang Province, it should start with transportation. There was a Xinjiang-Suiyuan Automobile Company in the province, which had been suspended for a long time due to frequent wars in the province. It is now planning to resume operations. Due to economic difficulties, it has submitted a request to the provincial government for subsidies, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan and handed over to the two ministries of Transportation and Railways and the four provincial governments of Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, and Suiyuan to jointly find ways to subsidize. After the automobile road is completed in the future, it will take only about 12 days from Dihua to Suiyuan, which is much more convenient than the previous camel travel, which took more than 70 days.</p>
<h3>Fifth National Congress Approved to be Held</h3>
<p>Mr. Chu stated that the Fifth National Congress, already decided upon by the Central Standing Committee, is approved to be held in Beijing on November 12th and will not be postponed further. A notification has already been issued. As for rumors that Mr. Hu Hanmin had expressed opposition to the Fifth National Congress, they are entirely baseless fabrications by troublemakers, and he himself has heard nothing of the sort. Mr. Chu also stated that President Wang's health has been quite good recently. Before leaving Beijing, he had not heard that President Wang intended to come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu's Return to the North Still Uncertain</h3>
<p>Regarding the meeting between President Wang, Chairman Chiang, and others on Mount Lu, President Wang has already made a statement in Beijing. He himself did not go to Mount Lu and therefore does not know the details. Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Ping, is still staying on Mount Lu. There is no definite news as to when he will return to the North. It is also unknown when Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, will return to Beijing to resume his duties. The Executive Yuan has not yet received a report, according to the Newsprint Paper Mill.</p>

<p>Regarding all outstanding issues between China and Russia, it is planned to begin negotiations after the autumn cools down, according to the Xinxin News Agency. Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, had previously gone to Kuling to escape the hot weather in Shanghai. It has been several weeks. Now that autumn has arrived and the weather has gradually cooled down, and because there are public affairs at the embassy that need to be handled, Bogomolov passed through Beijing and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, staying at the Russian Consulate on the Bund. According to sources in diplomatic circles, regarding all outstanding issues between China and Russia, Ambassador Bogomolov plans to conduct consultations with our foreign affairs authorities after the autumn cools down.</p>

<h3>Vice Consul Visits Our Diplomatic Circles</h3>
<p>The newly appointed honorary vice consul of Greece in Shanghai, Mr. Y. Ammonlates, visited Director Yu at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Fenglin Bridge the other day.

Yesterday, foreign newspapers reported that Mr. Y. Ammonlates was the acting consul general of Greece in Shanghai, which is not accurate. Mr. Y. Ammonlates was originally a businessman in Shanghai and has just been appointed as the honorary vice consul of Greece in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications' Reply</h3>
<h3>Various Inland River Steamer Associations</h3>
<p>Regarding the request for gradual easing and abolition of crew certification for vessels of 100 tons and 50 tons or less, according to Datong News Agency: The inland river steamer industry in this city, together with the inland river steamer associations in Nanjing and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Communications to gradually ease certification for vessels of 100 tons or less and to abolish certification for vessels of 50 tons or less. Yesterday, they received Reply No. 2457 from the Ministry of Communications, which stated: "We have received your submission. Upon investigation, there are quite a few inland river steamers with a tonnage between 50 and 150 tons. Many of the crew members of these ships have applied to the Ministry for certification in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Crew Certification promulgated and implemented by the Ministry in June of last year. This shows that the crew members of inland river steamers are also willing to be certified by the Ministry. The Ministry has formulated these regulations after careful consideration of practical needs and has also taken into consideration the fact that many current small steamer crew members are illiterate. Therefore, Article 9 of the regulations on crew certification subjects allows for leniency in handling matters (the above-mentioned subjects, except for Chinese language, may be conducted through oral examination). Furthermore, Article 14 of the regulations only stipulates that applications for certification must be made within six months from the date of promulgation and does not stipulate that those who do not apply for certification within the deadline will be penalized with prohibition from service. This is different from the strict enforcement measures stipulated in the Provisional Regulations for Crew Certification for vessels of 50 tons or more. For those crew members who have not yet applied to the Ministry for certification, they may still continue to serve according to the regulations. This embodies the Ministry's deep intention to show consideration for the difficulties faced by merchants and to protect the livelihoods of crew members. The request should not be discussed further. You are hereby notified of this reply." The Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee held a meeting yesterday</p>

<p>12th Session</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union Congress</h3>
<p>Election of Executive and Supervisory Committee Members. The 2nd representative assembly of the 12th session of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union was convened at 3 PM on August 17th in the dining hall on the 3rd floor of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, attended by 122 representatives, Mao Xiaxuan (representative of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters), Lu Jingshi and Zhao Shusheng (representatives of the National Postal Workers' Union), and the presidium of Zhang Kechang, Lu Keming, and Shui Xiangyun. Xiao Qingshan served as secretary. (1) Formalities were observed. (2) The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the union has a long history and that today marks the end of the 11th session and the beginning of the 12th. Recalling the past hardships of the struggle, he felt the greater importance of the mission ahead. The most important purpose of today's meeting is to select comrades who are considered talented, loyal, and sincere to serve as executive and supervisory committee members of the 12th session, representing the 3,000 members of the union in their struggles. At the same time, he hoped that all representatives would jointly shoulder the mission of the union, uphold its consistent spirit, and seek the flourishing of union affairs, with deep hope. (3) Reports from various departments: 1. The Organization Department reported on organizational matters and the establishment of branches in the interior. 2. The Negotiation Section reported on various negotiation events of the 11th session. 3. The Economic Department reported on the total amount of economic expenditures of the 11th session. (4) Comrade Mao Xiaxuan, representative of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, gave a speech, stating that the union has not yet obtained legal status due to restrictions of the Trade Union Law, but with the union's past revolutionary history and its continued efforts in the future, it should not be difficult to achieve final victory. Furthermore, among the government agencies in our country, the postal service is the most well-managed, mainly because the members of the union are all educated to a considerable extent, so they are able to achieve this good result, which is not only a shining example in the labor movement. Not only that, but with the union's spirit of struggle, in addition to striving for the protection of workers and the popularization of education, the promotion of physical education, and engaging in construction projects for workers, it should also be able to contribute to the country and the nation in order to achieve equality of national status, and so on. (5) Comrade Lu Jingshi, representative of the National Postal Workers' Union, gave a speech, first saying that the postal workers' union organization has gradually become more well-organized, the accounting system has gradually improved, and the handling of cases is well-organized, all of which are indicative of the vibrant spirit of the comrades responsible for the 11th session, which is very satisfying. He went on to say that the hope for the cause is great, but the pressure from the environment is also great. Our union should cooperate sincerely with the authorities today to strive for the advancement of construction in both postal affairs and union affairs. However, the authorities' desire to get rid of our union is even deeper than before. Therefore, the General Union's current construction plans regarding the welfare of workers, such as raising funds to build union halls, establishing postal workers' consumer cooperatives, and vocational schools for postal workers' children, as well as long-standing cases regarding the improvement and consolidation of the postal service, such as the merger of the savings and remittance bureau, which has been approved by the court, the implementation of the personnel selection examination system, and the National Postal Conference, and the joint establishment of postal and telecommunications services, although the union has very reasonable grounds, the authorities have all ignored them, and even prohibited the deduction of postal workers' union dues in the five provinces of Yu, E, Gan, Wan, and Min, and insisted on collecting them themselves, wanting to dissolve the union organization. The difficulties of the environment are greater than in the past. After reviewing the past, I cannot but earnestly hope that the postal workers of the whole country will redouble their efforts to break this dangerous environment. (6) Re-election of the executive and supervisory committee members of the 12th session, and Xu Duo, Zheng Wenquan, Xiong Mingzhang, and Wei Tongliang were nominated as vote counters, Zhu Yunsheng, Chen Gang, Ma Fuming, and Lin Bingshe were nominated as ballot writers, and Xu Ziqin, Shu Zhuping, Cheng Zuoqing, and Cai Tongfu were nominated as vote supervisors.

Supervisory Committee Members (5): Zhang Yidao, Zhang Yifei, Wang Zhenbai, Wang Kai, Zhu Yunsheng. Alternate Supervisory Committee Members (3): Wang Dongming, Xue Liansheng, Yao Genhu. (7) Adjournment. Jiangxi Province Purchases Rice from Shanghai</p>
<h3>Third Batch Scheduled to be Shipped</h3>
<p>Rice prices in Jiangxi Province have fallen. In order to curb the high rice prices in the local area, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has successively entrusted Yumin Bank to purchase small-grain Hunan and Anhui rice from Shanghai, totaling 13,000 shi, which will be shipped in batches. The second batch of 4,300 bags of rice arrived in the province yesterday. Local unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, seeing the large-scale import of Shanghai rice and the fact that the authorities are selling it at a fair price, are also vying to sell off their stocks. Therefore, the high-grade rice, which was sold for 13.7 yuan before the purchase of Shanghai rice, has now fallen to 12 yuan. The number 2 rice, which was originally sold for 12 yuan, has fallen to 10.4 yuan. According to the director of the Yumin Bank office speaking to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, everything is expensive in the bandit areas of Jiangxi Province. Vegetables are sold for 6 jiao per jin, and rice is in short supply. In other areas, new rice has already entered the market. The best harvest is 70%, and the worst is 30%, averaging 50%. Therefore, there is no great panic about rice. Now, another 5,000 bags of current rice have been purchased and are scheduled to be loaded onto the Changxing Wheel of the Sanbei Company on Tuesday (the 22nd) for shipment. The 8,000 bags of futures rice for September are expected to be delivered at the beginning of the month, pending instructions to load. However, it is reported that another telegram has been received requesting to purchase tens of thousands of shi, but no official telegram of commission has been received here. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities</p>
<h3>Enquires About Vegetable Gasoline</h3>
<p>The test results show that the oil smells the same as (ether). The bureau is currently conducting a chemical test to determine its authenticity. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities previously noticed a report that Mr. Liang had invented vegetable gasoline and paid close attention to it. While the bureau was trying to investigate, Mr. Liang and others brought the gasoline to the bureau and requested a test. After the bureau sent staff to test it, it was also able to start the car. However, because the gasoline seems to be ether, a common pharmaceutical product, it is highly suspected. The bureau is now conducting a chemical test on the oil and investigating Mr. Liang's manufacturing methods so that the public can understand it. The Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities talks about the city's</p>
<h3>Electrical Network Plan</h3>
<p>The generating capacity of Chinese-owned power plants in the city is sufficient to meet demand. Denies discussing feed-in cooperation methods with foreign-owned power companies. Yesterday, local newspapers in this city reported on "The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is Proceeding to Complete the City's Electrical Network Plan." The reporter believed that this matter was extremely important to the development of the city's electrical industry, so he specially visited Director Xu of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to inquire about the truth. The following is a record of his conversation. The report in yesterday's newspapers that the bureau convened the Chinese-owned Zhabei companies and the Shanghai Power Company to discuss feed-in cooperation methods and the installation of special motors, and the interconnection of the cables of the three electrical companies, is completely untrue. There are five companies operating electrical businesses in this city, namely the Chinese-owned Zhabei, Pudong, Xianghua, and Zhenru electrical companies. The bureau, considering that the scale of each electrical company is different and the electricity prices are also inconsistent, and that if they generate electricity on their own, it would not be in line with economic principles, therefore formulated a unified power plant plan and urged the electrical companies to comply. The first step of this plan is to stop the generation of electricity by small power plants and make them purchase electricity from large power plants for resale. The second step is to install interconnection lines between large power plants so that they can mutually assist each other in times of emergency and can save on spare parts, reducing the cost of power generation. Since the implementation of this plan, Xianghua and Zhenru companies have both purchased electricity from the Zhabei Hydropower Company for resale. The Pudong Electrical Company uses underwater cables to connect with Puxi and purchases electricity from both the Zhabei and Chinese-owned companies. At the end of 1922, the Chinese-owned Electrical Company erected special high-voltage power lines on Zhongshan Road to connect with Zhabei. Now, the Pudong and Puxi routes have formed a ring, and the safety of power supply has become more stable. The electricity prices of the small companies have also been gradually reduced, and the plan to unify the city's power plants has been completed. Currently, the power generation center in this city is concentrated in the Chinese-owned Zhabei two major power plants. The capacity of these two power plants has gradually become insufficient recently and they are proceeding to build a new large-scale power plant and purchase additional machinery. In short, the power plants operated by the Chinese in this city have sufficient power generation to supply the city's use. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has not discussed feed-in cooperation methods with foreign-owned power companies. Eurasia Company</p>
<h3>Northwest Resumption of Flights Uncertain</h3>
<p>The Lanzhou-Ningxia line is being considered for suspension, according to Xinxin News Agency. Regarding the rumor that Eurasia Aviation Company's Lanzhou-Ningxia line is planned to be suspended immediately to save money due to poor business, Mr. Li Jingzong, general manager of the company, said yesterday that the Lanzhou-Ningxia route has had poor business since its opening. As to whether it will be suspended, the company is currently considering it and has not yet made a decision. Since the Northwest route was suspended due to the Sheng-Ma war in Xinjiang, it has been a long time. Although the new chaos has been quelled, the Xinjiang Provincial Party Committee has not yet sent a reply to Shanghai, so the resumption date of the route has not yet been determined. It is also heard that Mr. Li's plan to go to Xinjiang to meet with Sheng Shicai to discuss everything in person has now been abandoned.</p>
<h3>British American Tobacco Factory Implements Work Reduction</h3>
<p>The union has already expressed its acceptance. The local British American Tobacco Company has recently experienced sluggish sales and a mountain of inventory. In order to temporarily maintain the status quo, it convened the heads of the various departments of the Second Factory in Pudong and the Third Factory in Hudong the other day to explain the recent decline in business conditions. If production continues as usual, the company will suffer huge losses. Therefore, it is proposed to change the four-day work week to a three-day work week. Regarding the workers' livelihood, the company will consider increasing wages appropriately and will cancel this arrangement when work returns to normal. The department heads have expressed their acceptance of the company's plan, so starting this week, the factory's work will be changed to a three-day work week. Large quantities of this tax-evading dumping.</p>
<h3>Match Industry Asks For Strict Suppression</h3>
<p>A meeting will be held soon to discuss countermeasures. Our country's match industry is facing a severe decline in business due to the dumping of foreign goods. Recently, a large number of Japanese matches have been smuggled into the South China and North China areas, reducing prices and aggressively encroaching on national matches. In order to maintain the national match business, the National Match Industry Association has submitted a request to the Tax Affairs Administration to strictly suppress the smuggling. They subsequently received a reply that the matter was within the jurisdiction of the Customs Administration, so they submitted a request to the Customs Administration for investigation. However, there are still no concrete measures to date. Therefore, it is planned to convene various match manufacturers soon to discuss countermeasures and submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for effective suppression.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Discusses Relief Methods</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan telegraphed to take responsibility for investigating the truth of dereliction of duty. Kong Zirong and others left Shanghai for Henan yesterday to investigate everything. The second breach of the Yellow River in Changyuan has affected another 19 counties. The local Shanghai National Government Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee received a telegram from the Executive Yuan yesterday, taking responsibility for disaster relief in the affected areas and investigating responsibility for dereliction of duty. Important officials of the committee held an emergency meeting at the club on the Bund yesterday morning to discuss how to proceed. The committee sent Kong Xiangrong, director of the work relief group, and engineer Zhu Yong and two others on the 4 PM express train to Beijing to transfer to Kaifeng to investigate the disaster situation. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency specially visited the committee to record the situation as follows.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Met Yesterday to Discuss Methods</h3>
<p>Recently, a second breach occurred in Changyuan County of the Yellow River, and the disaster has affected another 19 counties and cities. There have been as many as nine breaches. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to take responsibility for investigating responsibility for dereliction of duty and for relief and rehabilitation. The committee held an emergency meeting with its important officials at its office on the Bund yesterday to discuss how to proceed. Three points were decided: (1) Thoroughly investigate whether there was any dereliction of duty in the original engineering design of the Yellow River breach. (2) Send personnel to the scene to conduct an on-site investigation of the true situation of the breach. (3) Request the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds for rehabilitation and relief work.</p>
<h3>Mr. Kong Xiangrong Departs to Investigate</h3>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangrong, director of the work relief group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, had returned to Shanghai from Shandong a week ago due to a back illness and had been recuperating at home for ten days. He had intended to take another ten days off to recuperate. However, due to the second breach of the Yellow River, which urgently needed relief, he decided to personally depart to investigate everything after the relief steps were decided upon at yesterday's meeting. He departed yesterday at 4 PM on the express train with Zhu Yong, chief engineer of the committee, to Beijing, where they will transfer to Kaifeng to thoroughly investigate who is responsible for this accident and to carry out relief measures. After arriving in Henan, they plan to immediately telegram Minister of Finance Kong to request the allocation of funds for work relief and disaster relief because there were originally 4 million yuan for work relief expenses, of which more than 500,000 yuan had not been allocated. Therefore, the funds will be used to handle this Yellow River disaster in order to complete the relief work.</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Telegraphed About the Current Situation</h3>
<p>After the Yellow River disaster struck for the second time, the situation was critical in the past two days. Recently, the situation has eased slightly due to the slightly lower water level. Yesterday, Hebei Province Chairman Yu Xuezhong telegraphed the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee to report on the recent situation of the Yellow River disaster. The original telegram stated: "There are a total of nine breaches in the Changyuan County area of the Yellow River, from Stone Flower to Dacheji Line. After continuous days of rushing to plug the breaches, five breaches have been repaired. The other four are also being rescued with all efforts, and the situation is expected to improve," and so on.</p>
<h3>A Korean Discovers Confucius' Authentic Calligraphy</h3>
<p>Transported to Shanghai and detained by a certain country. It will now be used for public research. According to the China East News Agency, the person who discovered Confucius' handwriting here was a Korean named Ding, who found it in the Confucius wall. Its writing style is neither Greater Seal nor similar to Lesser Seal. It is now being brought to Shanghai by a Korean expatriate, who has been detained by a certain country. Fortunately, the antiquities have been returned. The reporter saw a photo of this item at an artist's place yesterday and heard that the group intends to ask antiquity experts to study this item. Shen Sifang goes to Jinan.</p>
<h3>Attending the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Private Electric Power Industries, in order to establish contact with domestic academic organizations, has specially dispatched its Director-General, Shen Sifang, to attend the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held in Jinan. It is reported that Mr. Shen departed for Jinan yesterday, and in addition to reporting on the recent situation of private electrical industries in China to the Institute, he will also conduct investigations and provide guidance to electrical and telephone companies in Shandong Province.</p>
<h3>Press Visit to Jiu Xin Enamel Factory</h3>
<p>Established Two Years Ago, Large Scale, Pragmatic Approach, Excellent Products. The Jiu Xin Enamel Factory, located at 363 Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi, Shanghai, began constructing its factory buildings in the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, occupying twelve acres of land.  Since beginning production in May of the 21st year, although only a little over two years have passed, due to the diligent management and pragmatic approach of the factory's manager, Mr. Gu Zhilian, the products are excellent, sold throughout the country, and making daily progress.  Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the company's manager, Mr. Gu Zhilian, invited reporters from various newspapers to visit the factory. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Manager's Speech</h3>
<p>Attendees included Ma Yinliang, Qu Shao Yi, Sun Enlin, Huang Jiping, and Sun Daosheng from Shen Bao; Li Zutang and Jiang Zongyi from Xinwen Bao; Xu Zhuodai, Zhang Changren, Hu Tisheng, and Wang Qixu from Chen Bao; Wu Hanzhu and Jiang Zongdao from Shi Bao; Sun Chuyuan from Shishi Xinbao; and Wu Zhongyi from Min Bao, totaling about twenty people. Mr. Gu greeted them cordially, and after light refreshments, Mr. Gu and Gong Huibai, a standing director of the Jiu Xin Enamel Factory, rose to give speeches, reporting on the factory's internal organization, manufacturing, and business situation. They emphasized that the factory focuses on three principles in its product line: excellent quality, novel designs, and durability, to compete with imported goods. Therefore, raw materials are carefully selected, technology is constantly improved, and expenses are reduced to lower costs. Efforts are also made to foster harmonious labor-management relations to increase production. In this time of national crisis and backward production in our country, promoting domestic goods is imperative. Fellow countrymen have been advocating for this cause tirelessly, but amidst the calls to promote domestic goods, the enamel industry has seen continuous price drops since last year, leading to selling prices below cost. If this continues, the dire consequences are foreseeable, akin to mutual destruction. Competition is not inherently bad, but it should not involve price wars that lead to self-destruction. Instead, competition should focus on technology to improve products, which would bring hope to the domestic goods industry. They hoped that the press would use their influence to correct this situation, as the future of domestic goods relies on it.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Various Departments</h3>
<p>The visitors were then led to visit various departments, such as the blanking, powder making, pickling, enameling, and art departments, as well as other offices, employee dormitories, dining hall, kitchen, and bathroom, totaling over a hundred rooms. The blanking workshop contained dozens of machines of various sizes, the largest of which could press round basins with a diameter of sixty centimeters. The powder making workshop contained an enamel kiln, six cylindrical enamel grinding machines, and a large stone mill for grinding raw materials. The pickling workshop contained over a dozen pickling tanks. The enameling workshop contained six kilns. The art workshop contained over a dozen spraying machines. The initial step is blanking. For example, to make a basin blank, a whole sheet of iron is first cut into a circular piece, then pressed into a basin shape, and finally, the edges are trimmed, rolled, and polished. The blanking process for other products is roughly similar. The second step is powder making. Various raw materials are first crushed, then mixed, fired, and ground. The third step is to place the blanks, those with oil are fired in a kiln, those with rust are pickled in a tank, and then coated with enamel powder and fired in a kiln. The enameling process is also quite complex, involving two coats of base enamel, three bisque firings, and after finishing, it is sent to the art workshop to add printed figures or painted flowers, and then fired again. The fourth step is to send the fired products to the inspection department for inspection, discarding the inferior and keeping the good, and then sending them to the packaging room for packaging, boxing, and marketing. After the visit, all the reporters praised the factory as a rising star in the domestic enamel industry. Around 4:00 PM, a group photo was taken and the visit concluded. The factory also presented each reporter with several exquisite daily necessities as souvenirs.  Hong Jingshan</p>

Initially, Fu Shengui and Sun Renlan were hired as managers and assistant managers, but they resigned one after another shortly after. This year, Zeng Shigao was hired as manager. Shortly after, Zeng also resigned. Chairman of the Board Wu Zhihao and Standing Director Chen Cuifu tried hard to retain him, but to no avail. The following is the bank's reply after Hong Jingshan's resignation: "Dear Mr. Hong, we received your letter dated July 24th on July 25th of this year, which stated: 'I am writing to inform you that I was hired by your office as the assistant manager of the Shanghai branch. At the beginning of my tenure, it was stated that there would be a three-month probationary period. However, due to difficulties in handling affairs and a lack of understanding from the usual authorities, I am resigning from the positions of assistant manager of the Shanghai branch and supervisor of the Suzhou branch, effective the end of July. I respectfully request your approval.' We hereby acknowledge receipt. Since you joined our bank, you have worked diligently. We were relying on your talents to work together and develop the bank. However, you have suddenly expressed your desire to resign. We have tried to retain you repeatedly, but to no avail, which is deeply disappointing. Since you are resolute in your decision to resign, we have no choice but to grant your request. We hope that you will not forget old friendships and will continue to provide guidance from time to time. With anticipation and prayers, from the Management Department of Ningbo Industrial Bank."</p>

Japanese Sundries Merchant</p>
<h3>Shirasa Eizo Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea</h3>
<p>Ryuta Maru Travels Through Wenzhou Bay - Passengers Experience an Unlucky Journey. Yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that the Japanese mail ship Ryuta Maru, which travels between Honolulu and Hong Kong, departed from Hong Kong on the 15th. On the 16th at 8:00 PM, while traveling outside the mouth of Wenzhou Bay, a Japanese resident in the third-class cabin suddenly disappeared. Ship attendants searched everywhere, but could not find him. Subsequent investigations revealed that the Japanese man was a sundries merchant from Niigata Prefecture, named Shirasa Eizo, aged 39. The ship immediately telegraphed his family. The ship docked the previous night. Police from the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, based on a report from the Ryuta Maru's captain, Ito, sent his belongings back to his family and investigated the cause of his death. According to ship attendants, he did not show any signs of suicide on board. However, his travel ticket was very unlucky, as the number was (444) (Note: In Japanese, the pronunciation of "four" is the same as "death," so it is considered unlucky). This was a silent omen of his impending death. It is said that after bathing on the 16th night, he was mentally agitated and secretly jumped into the sea.  Shanghai Municipal Council</p>

<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Trend of Releasing Air from Tires</p>
<h3>Police Press Charges Against Instigators</h3>
<p>Trial Held Yesterday at the Special Court No. 1, Crowd of Listeners. All Defendants Denied Instigating Behavior - Zhu Shuqiao Granted Bail Due to Illness. Since the rickshaw tire deflation incident occurred, Chief Inspector McKay of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been supervising his officers to investigate the masterminds behind it. As a result of the investigation, Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, He Wushan (also known as He Liansheng), and Zhu Shuqiao were arrested and handed over to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the Special Court No. 1 Criminal Division continued the interrogation. The Shanghai Municipal Police was deeply concerned about the possibility of incidents occurring, so they dispatched many inspectors and Chinese and Western detectives to guard inside and outside the court to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. The Legal Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council also believed that the situation was serious and had a great impact on public security, so they specially sent lawyers Ru Baoyi and Qian Xunjiu to appear in court. The Rickshaw Merchants Association was represented by lawyers Chen Tingrui, Jiang Baoli, and Wu Kaisheng, who brought a civil suit as an accessory. On the defendant's side, over ten lawyers, including Wu Linkun, Yu Chengxiu, Yao Yongli, Fu Ganghou, Xiang Xun, and Zhang Yifan, were hired to defend them. There were also</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Onlookers</h3>
<p>Judge Zhan took the bench at around 8:00 AM. First, he asked Zheng Fazhu and others about their ages, places of origin, and occupations. Then, lawyer Ru Baoyi rose to state that the police were bringing public charges against them under Article 318 of the Criminal Code for using violence and coercion to obstruct the freedom of others to exercise their rights, and Article 382 of the same code for destroying and damaging property. However, the crimes of the defendants in this case were all indirect. They did not personally go out and carry out illegal destructive work. They were instigators and masterminds, encouraging ignorant rickshaw pullers and idlers who were deceived by them to engage in tire deflation work and be punished by law. If the defendants in this case are indeed the instigators, they should be punished according to the law. In the case of the 4.2 Million Red Pill Case,</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice Zhou Shengfa Apprehended</h3>
<p>Previous Five Accomplices Had Been Sentenced to Death. Zhou Denied Trafficking and Claimed No Connection. Court Ordered Remand in Custody, Re-trial Scheduled in Seven Days. On February 4th of this year, a large batch of Feima brand red pills, disguised as luggage and attempting to be smuggled onto trains and transported to the interior, was discovered in the luggage room of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Stations. There were seven bags in total, each containing 600,000 pills, totaling 4.2 million pills. At that time, the police seized the drugs and took them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Meanwhile, detectives secretly investigated the manufacturers and traffickers. Two people named Wang Huicheng and Zhao Zuting, as well as three police officers who colluded with them, were arrested. Recently, the case has been investigated clearly and handed over to military authorities, who sentenced the five people to death and executed them by firing squad in accordance with the newly promulgated Strict Prohibition of烈性Narcotic Drugs Regulations. However, during the trial, the five criminals confessed that the red pills were jointly manufactured by Zhou Shengfa and Gu Miaogen from Yuyao, Shaoxing. Detectives from the bureau later learned that Zhou lived at No. 1, Laul Village, East Rouland Road in the French Concession. When they went to investigate, he had already fled without a trace. Now, it has been discovered that Zhou was hiding at No. 20, Yuanyuan Lane, 707 Gordon Road in the Public Concession. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, Detective Ling Tianpeng reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives and Western detectives to the address and arrested Zhou Shengfa. The suspect is 38 years old and physically tall and strong. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi brought him in for interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case and stated that this case was a cooperative matter. However, if he is taken away by the Public Security Bureau, the defendant's life will be in danger. For the sake of prudence, the police believe that the Public Security Bureau should present evidence to prove it, and then ask the court to decide. Then, Detective Ling reported on the handling of the case, and submitted to the court for inspection the confidential orders from his superiors, the interrogation records of the executed criminals, and the official documents requesting the transfer. He requested that the court approve the transfer. Zhou Shengfa hired lawyers Fan Gang and Jiang Yiping to defend him, denying any connection with the trafficking of red pills. He said that if Zhou was indeed an accomplice, why didn't the Public Security Bureau arrest him earlier? Now that all the arrested criminals have been executed, and Zhou is accused of being an accomplice, there is no proof of death. Therefore, he requested that he not be transferred. After reviewing the case, Judge Wu ordered Zhou Shengfa to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial in seven days. Punishment. However, there is one point: each defendant has written a confession at the police station. Before questioning the defendants, the court is requested to first inquire whether the confession was legally obtained. If it was indeed</p>
<h3>Legally Obtained,</h3>
<p>Then it can be used as evidence. If it was not legally obtained, then the police have more than 20 witnesses and physical evidence today that can be used to prove it. Then he submitted the confession to the court. The court then asked Zheng Fazhu whether the confession was legally obtained. He answered yes, but the confession omitted the fact that rickshaw merchants had exerted pressure. As for the petition, I also went, but I only advised the rickshaw pullers and did not instigate tire deflation. Zhu Fengxiang also confessed that he did not instigate tire deflation, and that he had apprehended a tire deflation perpetrator, Xu Changfa, at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road and handed him over to Chinese constable No. 861 to take him back to the police station. The police, through Chinese Chief Constable Lu Dagong and Chinese Constable No. 861, proved that Zhu Fengxiang did not arrest him at the time, but that he had seen Zhu standing on wasteland at the police station afterward. When asked about Cang Gongwen, he also denied the charges. The police lawyer then presented</p>
<h3>Two Leaflets,</h3>
<p>One was picked up on the road, containing sentences such as "Down with the Municipal Council" and bearing Cang's signature. The other was found at Cang's home at 185 Maybark Road, containing sentences such as "No rent, no shift handover, pull the rickshaw yourself, eat yourself". But Cang denied it. When asked about He Wushan, he also denied it. The police then presented rickshaw pullers Bian Changfa and Zhang Dewu, who testified that He had instigated them to participate in the strike and tire deflation work, promising to give each of them four dimes. Bian had already received his four dimes, but Zhang had not yet received his. Lawyer Wu Linkun then pointed out that the two witnesses were ordered to come to court by rickshaw merchant Zheng Guoliang, and that Zheng was also in court today, requesting that he be investigated. The court then summoned Zheng to the stand. Zheng testified that he was a labor representative of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee and a director of the Rickshaw Pullers Association. After the unfortunate incident occurred, detectives from the Political Department ordered me to investigate the instigators. I met Bian and Zhang on Du Padre Road, who told me about He Wushan's</p>
<h3>Instigating Behavior.</h3>
<p>I then took them to the police station. This is the whole story. When questioned about Zhu Shuqiao, he confessed that after the Shanghai Municipal Council revised the rickshaw regulations, a friend wanted to form a new company and asked me to help him get a license. I then went to Wang Zhizai, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Wang immediately took me to see Zhu Maocheng, a member of the Rickshaw Committee. After seeing me, Zhu said that there were now disputes over rickshaws, and that the newspaper reports were all from the perspective of the rickshaw merchants. He instructed me to help them with their work and guide the rickshaw pullers. I agreed, but requested that there not be too many of those being guided. Committee member Zhu then designated Zhu Fengxiang, He Liansheng, Cang Gongwen, Xu Zuolin, and four others to be guided by me to get on the right track and petition the Shanghai Municipal Council. It was I who ordered them to do so, but I only requested that there be no more than 200 people. Later, I saw in the newspaper that there were over 1,000 petitioners, so I questioned Zhu Fengxiang, who said that some of them had voluntarily joined along the way. At this point, Lawyer Wu Linkun requested a postponement to summon Zhu Maocheng, Wang Zhicheng, and Mr. Massey, the chairman of the Rickshaw Committee, to testify. He also requested bail for Zhu Shuqiao, who was ill. The court granted the request and adjourned the hearing. Zhu Shuqiao was released on bail of 500 yuan, or a guarantee from a business, and the rest were remanded in custody. Zhoujiadu, Pudong</p>
<h3>Major Fire at Zhanghua Factory</h3>
<p>Worker's Cigarette Butt Causes Disaster - Losses Amounting to 50,000 Yuan. The Zhanghua Woolen Textile Factory in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, is owned by prominent Shanghai businessman Liu Hongsheng and others. It has been in operation for many years and has a wholesale outlet on Sichuan Road, with fairly thriving business. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 AM yesterday, the roof of the factory's drying room, due to the dilapidation of the lead sheeting, was damaged. Five workers were hired to repair the roof. Unexpectedly, the workers carelessly threw their cigarette butts down the hole, and the pile of wool suddenly caught fire. In an instant, the fire spread rapidly and became uncontrollable. When the factory's security guards discovered it, they immediately reported it to the Pudong Fire Brigade and did their best to extinguish the fire with the factory's own fire extinguishers. At the same time, the Dongjiadu Fire Brigade on the Puxi side, as well as the French Concession Fire Brigade, Customs, and others, dispatched leather-belt fire engines to assist in the firefighting. The fire was extinguished at around 10:00 AM. One drying room, three machines, and over 2,000 bales of wool were destroyed, with a total loss of over 50,000 yuan. The scene was very chaotic at the time. Dong Zhaojiang, the chief of the Third Section of the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, rushed to the scene with police officers to suppress the situation, maintain order, and investigate the cause of the fire, and reported it to the headquarters for the record. It is reported that the factory had fire insurance with Taiping Insurance Company and is currently negotiating with the company, requesting compensation for the losses.  Shanghai Bank Relief for Rural Areas</p>
<h3>Trial Implementation of Farming Cattle Associations</h3>
<p>One located in Hu Shu Town, Jiangning; one located in Shi Jia Ji, Chuxian. The Shanghai Bank, recognizing that in recent years, rural areas have suffered repeated droughts and floods, and that financing has dried up, leading to concerns about potential collapse if rescue measures are not implemented, has established an Agricultural Cooperative Loan Department within the bank to specifically handle these matters. The initial plan involves piloting Farming Cattle Associations in two locations: Jiangning in Jiangsu and Chuxian in Anhui. The membership procedures are simple; anyone who owns a farming ox and has a reasonable ability to make a living can join the association. An association can be established with seven or more members, paying a membership fee of five dimes and a deposit of five yuan. Members who wish to mortgage their farming cattle can have the mortgage value assessed based on the size of the ox, ranging from twenty to thirty yuan. However, members must guarantee each other, with a fixed term of six months for principal repayment. The interest rate shall not exceed one and a half cents. The mortgaged cattle remain under the management of the original owner and cannot be stolen or sold. As the Farming Cattle Association is a pioneering initiative, the scope of implementation is relatively small, with only two established locations. One is in Hu Shu Town, Jiangning County, managed by the association's Hu Shu Town farmers using mortgage loans. Since June, a total of 1,307 heads of cattle have been mortgaged, with loan payments totaling 13,329 yuan. The other is in Shi Jia Ji, Chuxian, managed by the bank's Shi Jia Ji agricultural product transportation and sales cooperative. It has organized 62 farming cattle groups, with a total of 167 heads of cattle mortgaged. It is heard that many places are requesting the bank to continue establishing Farming Cattle Associations, but the bank needs to assess the performance of the existing ones before deciding whether to continue.</p>
<h3>City Farmers' Association Held Drought Prevention Meeting Yesterday</h3>

Announcement by the Agricultural Experiment Station.</p>
<h3>Estimated Number of Livestock Nationwide</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Experiment Station, established by the Ministry of Industry, announced yesterday its estimates of the number of livestock nationwide. Draft animals are most commonly yellow cattle, with horses, mules, and donkeys more prevalent in the northwestern provinces. Meat animals, chickens, and pigs are most evenly distributed, with each farming household averaging one to three pigs and six to twelve chickens. Sheep are more prevalent in the northwest.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle Accident</h3>
<p>Three rickshaw pullers injured. At around 1:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese military vehicle with the inscription S.D.F. No. 68, fully loaded with soldiers, was passing the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wuchang Road when, due to excessive speed, it collided with a rickshaw. Several barrels of asphalt being transported on the vehicle rolled onto the road and crushed three rickshaw pullers. They are Pan Liangyuan, 36 years old, with a fractured sternum and head injuries; Xu Xingrong, 29 years old, with a fractured sternum; and Zhao Xingkang, 50 years old, with severe abdominal injuries. All were in critical condition. Police officer No. 504 arrived to record the vehicle number of the Japanese soldiers involved in the accident and promptly sent the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Continued hearing of the case against the Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital.</p>
<h3>Medical Doctors Debate in Court</h3>
<p>Doctors Chen Jingxu and Diao Xinde appear in court as witnesses. The Women and Children's Hospital invites a German doctor to testify about the patient's condition. Wang, whose maiden name is Zhifen, the wife of Li Shilin, a local who established the Donghua Construction Company at 34 Shangxianfang, Xiafei Road, French Concession, was sent to Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital on Saposai Road, behind her residence, in her seventh month of pregnancy on June 29th of this year. After giving birth, she developed puerperal fever and died on July 12th. Li believes that the hospital did not provide proper treatment when the woman was ill, resulting in her death, and that the hospital director and doctors were negligent in their duties. He hired lawyers Yan Yinwu and Lu Congzu to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's criminal division, accusing the director of Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital, Zhang Xiangwen, doctors Ge Chenghui, head nurse Gu Qin Yue, etc., of</p>
<h3>Negligence in Duties</h3>
<p>Resulting in death, requesting that they be investigated according to the law and punished for their crimes. After the criminal court president Wang Gangxu held a hearing and summoned witnesses, he ordered a postponement for further questioning. As reported earlier, the hearing resumed yesterday morning. The plaintiff Li Shilin, accompanied by lawyers Yan and Lu, arrived at the court, as did the defendants with their defense lawyer Tan Yigong. Doctors Chen Jingxu and Diao Xinde also arrived in compliance with the summons. The plaintiff also invited a German doctor to court to prove the condition of the deceased. Because the case involved death during childbirth, it caused a stir, so the majority of those in court were from the medical community and women.</p>
<h3>Testimony from All Sides</h3>
<p>After reporting in, court president Wang Gangxu and clerk Ren Qiwu specially opened the fifth criminal court for the hearing. After briefly questioning both parties, they first questioned witness Doctor Chen Jingxu, who stated that he was a medical advisor at the Postal Bureau. On July 8th, at around 2:00 PM, he was invited by Li Shilin to the Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital to examine Li's wife, Wang Zhifen, at which time her temperature reached 104.8 degrees. Her vagina had tears and discharged foul-smelling pus. Later, at Li's residence, her temperature rose to 105.3 degrees, and she was delirious, in a dangerous state, with symptoms of puerperal fever. He immediately gave her an injection according to her condition. On July 7th, the sanitation department of the Ministry of Public Works determined that Li's wife was indeed suffering from</p>
<h3>Puerperal Fever</h3>
<p>On the same day, he invited Doctor Diao Xinde to consult. Ultimately, the illness was beyond cure, and she died on July 12th. Doctor Diao Xinde also stated that he visited Li Wang's residence on July 7th and confirmed that she had puerperal fever. He revisited her on the 11th, as her condition was very dangerous. During the two doctors' testimonies, they seemed reluctant to fully express their opinions on the medical condition and their medical attitude. At this point, the judge summoned the female doctor from Shangxian Hall. According to Kuang Cuie, she studied medicine in the United States and, after returning to China, worked at the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital. She only recently started working at Shangxian Hall. On the morning of July 1st, when she saw Li Wang at Shangxian Hall, she had no symptoms. On the 4th, at noon, Director Zhang</p>
<h3>Called</h3>
<p>Said that Li Wang was seriously ill and asked her to see her. When she arrived in the afternoon, she saw that Li Shilin had already invited Doctor Chen to examine her, so she did not examine her again. According to Wu Yizhu, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's Chinese and Western Medical College and an obstetrician with over 20 years of experience, she started working as a resident doctor at Shangxian Hall on July 1st. That afternoon, she saw that Li Wang's temperature was 100 degrees and determined that she had breast swelling and a cough. On the 2nd, although it was 101 degrees, she still thought it was breast swelling. When she examined her on the afternoon of the 3rd, her temperature reached 103 degrees, so she paid attention and prepared to examine her for other illnesses the next day. According to Wang Baozhen, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's Medical College and an obstetrician at Shangxian Hall, on the morning of July 2nd, when she examined Li Wang, her temperature</p>
<h3>Did Not Attract Attention</h3>
<p>By the morning of the 3rd, the fever reached 102, so she thought it was a cold and gave her cold medicine. By the morning of the 4th, the temperature reached 102 degrees, and she did not know what illness she had, so she reported it to the director and asked another doctor to examine her. The judge asked what medicine they gave the patient from July 1st to July 4th, when Li Wang was discharged from the hospital. Wang replied that they gave her medicine for colds and coughs. At this time, both sides expressed strong opinions on medical matters, and the debate was fierce, especially regarding the numbers of white blood cells and the temperature. After a long debate between the two sides, it was close to noon, and the court ordered a postponement for further investigation. During the questioning, the defendant opposed the plaintiff's invitation of a Western doctor to the case, interfering with Chinese doctors' affairs.

<p>Related to Buddhist historical records. Our country's literature is extremely rich. To prevent foreigners from collecting and taking them away. Our country has experienced many years of unrest, and cultural relics and antiquities have either been destroyed in war or have flowed into foreign countries. Few private collections remain, which is a source of regret for archaeologists and scholars. However, due to the early introduction of Buddhism into our country, there are numerous temples nationwide, and various antiquities, cultural relics, and Dharma instruments are still preserved in temples. Therefore, the national government previously promulgated regulations for the registration and preservation of Dharma objects to prevent further loss. The Shanghai Chinese Buddhist Association recently received a letter from Shen Bin Fan of the Shaanxi Provincial Buddhist Association, stating that in recent years, the national government has issued various measures for the registration and preservation of cultural relics and Dharma instruments, and has specially created investigation forms, which have been entrusted to the Buddhist Association for implementation. However, Fan has observed in the places he has visited that many temples are perfunctory and have not been able to effectively implement the measures. He believes that this matter is of great importance to Buddhist historical records, Chinese literature, art, and other aspects. In recent years, countries in the East and West have been fully investigating art and sending experts to China to collect and transport away hundreds of items. The losses are immeasurable. To remedy this, it is proposed that the General Association issue a circular to the Buddhist Associations in various provinces and counties, entrusting qualified personnel to conduct thorough investigations of temples, including the construction period of the temple, whether there are steles, versions, statues, antiquities, cultural relics, and Dharma instruments, and to fill out forms and registers. Those who are already responsible for safekeeping should be instructed to take good care of them and not to lose them, in order to preserve them and facilitate research. After receiving the letter, the Association has strictly instructed Buddhist Associations in various locations to conduct thorough investigations, ordering temples to register and preserve the items, and not to lose them. × × × × Director Cai went to Beijing yesterday to request instructions.</p>
<h3>A Decision to Heavily Tax Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses</h3>
<p>Tax revenue has decreased since the abolition of the ship tax in this city. As tobacco and alcohol are consumable goods, a decision has been made to heavily tax them. Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, believes that since the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Ship Inspection Law and ordered the customs to collect tonnage dues, the original ship tax has been explicitly abolished by the Executive Yuan, resulting in a shortfall in tax revenue. Remedial measures are needed to maintain financial stability. As tobacco and alcohol are consumable goods and are addictive, harmful to health, and detrimental to the nation, the government should ban and eliminate them to maintain social stability. Therefore, a decision has been made to heavily tax tobacco and alcohol licenses in order to gradually eliminate them. To implement this policy, he took the Beijing-Shanghai express train to Beijing yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, along with Wang Xiangchen, Chief of the Second Section, to report to the central government and financial</p>

Subsequently, the Police Department disagreed with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the High Third Branch Court. The High Court had previously held an investigative hearing to question the various parties. This has been reported in detail in previous newspapers.

<h3>Two Prostitutes Injured by Corrosive Acid</h3>
<p>Shen Amai, a 23-year-old prostitute from Suzhou, known for her beauty, who resided at the Yingyun Study on the fourth lane of Fuyu Lane, Yunnan Road, was suddenly summoned by a Mr. Ye from a room on the fourth floor of the Nanjing Hotel at around 9:15 PM last night. Shortly after, Shen and another prostitute named Da Yuan went to the room as agreed. After sitting and talking with the guest for about ten minutes, they excused themselves and left. The two women took the elevator down together. When they reached the lower floor and walked to the outside of the gate, intending to get into their prepared rickshaw, a man in short sleeves suddenly rushed forward, pulled out a bottle of corrosive acid, and splashed it on Shen Amai and Da Yuan. Shen suffered serious injuries to her head and face, while Da Yuan was only slightly splashed on her hand.

<h3>Gambling Den Busted in a Hidden Compartment</h3>
<p>Seven gamblers arrested. After the authorities of a certain concession banned gambling dens within the concession a few years ago, the so-called "certain companies" and other large gambling venues closed down. Although the owners were wealthy and had no worries about food and clothing, many people relied on the gambling dens for a living. Because the ban was strictly enforced, it was difficult to operate, and their livelihoods were cut off, causing great panic. Therefore, they had a creative idea and chose the wharves in the Hongkou area, which have special circumstances, to secretly set up mobile gambling dens on various docked ships, enticing people to gamble. Due to the relationship between ship imports and exports, the gambling dens also moved from east to west and had no fixed location. Therefore, it was difficult for the water police to search and arrest them. Therefore, the gambling dens were often full of customers, and the stakes were as high as those in the gambling dens on land in the past. This year, the Water Patrol Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau busted a large gambling den on a certain ship in Hongkou and arrested a large number of gamblers of various kinds. This is how the mobile gambling dens operate. However, the water patrol police suddenly received a secret tip yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, stating that there was a secret gambling den set up in the hidden compartment on the Yantai-bound Yuansheng Steamer, which was docked at the Hongkou Yihe Wharf. At this time, there were more than a hundred gamblers gambling heavily. The head constable dispatched detectives Cheng Yongnian, Huang Zhenlin, Sun Agui, Qu Hekui, Gu Wenkui, Liang Shenqing, and others to rush to the ship to search and arrest. However, there were many lookouts in the gambling den. The news reached the ship, and the gamblers fled in droves. Although the detectives searched and arrested in different directions, they were mostly able to escape because there were too many doors and roads. As a result, seven people were arrested: Qian Liansheng (from Shanghai, resident of No. 4 Baoren Lane, Hujiaqiao, boatman), Zhang Longlong (from Shanghai, resident of No. 11 Xiangyin Road, butcher), Dong Fuxiang (from Yangzhou, resident of No. 655 Yuanfang Road, coppersmith), Lu Agen (from Tongzhou, resident of No. 57 Tongqing Lane, Huasheng Road, teahouse employee), Fu Chunfa (from Ningbo, resident of No. 778 Yuanfang Lane, Yuanfang Road, tailor), Xu Haigen (from Shanghai, resident of No. 1512 Xiafei Road, quartermaster), and Shao Jiliang (from Ningbo, resident of No. 43 Zhengming Lane, Hede Road, teahouse employee). Along with the gambling tools, they were taken to the police station. The detectives learned that the ringleader was named Xiao Agen and was currently at large. The head constable ordered them to be detained and handed over to the local court for questioning tomorrow (Monday) and ordered that the ringleader be arrested and brought to justice.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Guo Wenyu, who claims that he has been falsely accused of seducing the prostitute Pan Fengbao, also known as Hou No. 77. During the court hearing at 3:00 PM on August 15th, the court ordered that no spectators be allowed. Upon reading your newspaper's report on the interrogation the next day, I found that the facts were incorrect, especially the statement that my lawyer, representing Mr. Guo, stated that the defendant met the plaintiff at Liang Yue on Shantou Road through the introduction of his friend Yuan Jingbang, and spent more than 1,000 yuan on drinking and entertainment. This is completely unfounded and quite surprising. My lawyer only stated on behalf of Mr. Guo that he worked at the Minli Hospital on Sanma Road and was not an employee of Yikang Bank. From beginning to end, there was no statement as reported in your newspaper. The court transcript of the interrogation on that day can prove this. It is clear that your newspaper's report is based on inaccurate information. Since this concerns Mr. Guo's reputation, I am writing to request that your newspaper make a correction as soon as possible, to maintain public trust. Sincerely, Lawyer Hu Jueqi, To the Editor of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Learning Theory and Learning Technology</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance: After reading (Shi Shijian)'s Reading Q&amp;A on July 14th, there is (the first and second types only see the individual facts currently pressing on their heads regarding the concept of practice. On the one hand, they are complacent and degenerate, and on the other hand, they want to rely on increasing their skills to overcome the unavoidable unemployment panic). It also says: (Technology cannot forget the ultimate goal). In the past, I was almost like the second type of person you mentioned, planning, reading foreign languages, practicing writing, thinking (to overcome the inevitable huge force of unemployment in this situation). In order to (maintain the status quo and be complacent for a while), because the facts placed before us - the problem of life - showed me that I thought learning some skills was the only way out. Until now, I have realized that unless the entire society has a way out, it is too dangerous for individuals to try to make a living by chance, but it is not enough to only know that it is so and not know why it is so, so I want to read some theoretical books; At the same time, I also feel the urgency of practicing skills to make a living, so I have to abandon theory and temporarily focus on technology. I don't know if my attitude is right, please give me guidance. Learning Theory and Learning Technology - Answer to Mr. Chen Xuanzan The question you raised is very important. We believe that such questions are not unique to you. Now, thousands upon thousands of shop assistants and all those who rely on their full labor to maintain a minimum standard of living, who is not (pressed by individual facts), wanting to solve the problem of individual life but unable to solve it, wanting to understand the source of social ills but unable to forget their individual life, wanting to read some theoretical books, and at the same time feeling that they have to learn skills. How should this contradiction be resolved? Let's talk about reading first! We must understand that we read theoretical books not to become well-read scholars, as we have said time and time again. We must also understand that true knowledge cannot be obtained entirely from books. If you only know how to read books and pay no attention to the practice of life, you will not become a true scholar, but only a bookworm! Bookworms are useless to society, at best they can only deceive ignorant students in school classrooms. Moreover, even a true scholar's knowledge will never be perfect. Learning is limitless. The research results of each scholar are just a small fruit dug out in his life practice. In the vast sea of ​​truth, he can only make a drop of contribution. If we want to rely solely on the works of scholars to study, it is equivalent to confining ourselves to a narrow range, which is very dangerous. For example, Das Kapital naturally has its indelible value in economics, but in today's society, economic phenomena have appeared that exceed what Das Kapital explains. If we are only satisfied with a smattering of Das Kapital, then we will still absolutely not understand today's society. Therefore, each of us must be able to discover the truth that we can discover in the scope of our own life practice, and cannot rely solely on reading to seek knowledge. The knowledge in books is always somewhat isolated from my individual special life. For example, books tell us that the only way out for society now is the change of the system. Can we only think about the change of the system and not even care about the problem of eating in front of us? In fact, what the books tell us is only a general principle. We must not only know the principle and be done with it, but also apply this principle to our individual special life. Mr. Chen is forced by life and has to be busy with current affairs. We think this is right and necessary. Although we say: (Technology cannot forget the ultimate goal)! But this does not mean: for the ultimate goal, we must abandon technology and not even care about eating. No, definitely not like this! If everyone in society abandons their jobs, and everyone only knows the ultimate goal, what would it become? What we mean is only that the individual's life and the whole society are linked and inseparable. If we only care about individual life and do not see the trend of the whole society, even if we can get by for a while, we will eventually fail. For example, today, except for the Soviet Union, almost the whole world is caught in the vortex of economic panic. In this great vortex of economic panic, small shops and small producers will soon be destroyed. If we only care about getting by and do not care about the larger world situation, we will eventually feel that there is no way out. We will eventually fall into a state of pessimism and negativity. If we see the world trend clearly, I will understand that the way out for myself is the way out for the whole society, and understand that my future is to follow the common purpose of the public. I don't have to be pessimistic, negative, or even commit suicide because of individual occasional frustration. To understand the common purpose of the public, it is natural to read a little. But it is not enough to just understand. We also need to find out the relationship between this common purpose and individual life in the scope of our own life practice. This is still what we said before, we must be able to apply what we have learned from reading to practice. No, it is not correct to say this. We should say that we should find the confirmation of books in our individual practical life. For example, books tell us that the phenomenon of world economic panic is inevitable, then let's try to look around ourselves, are all the facts proving this theory? We see from practice that many commodities in Shanghai are in a state of despair, and we know that the theory is true. The function of reading is only to help us understand our own life more correctly. We must always base ourselves on life practice in order to obtain correct knowledge. Mr. Chen has to be busy with planning, reading foreign languages, and practicing writing. If these are indispensable skills in Mr. Chen's life, then it is right to learn them from the standpoint of individual life. We definitely don't want him to abandon these to study empty book knowledge. But at the same time, we hope that Mr. Chen will not only see the abacus when planning, but also connect the abacus to more general problems. We also hope that he will not think that planning and reading are absolutely opposed and incompatible. If I want to rely solely on books to become a bookworm, then it is of course incompatible with planning, but the problem is that the purpose of our reading is to seek living knowledge, that is, the knowledge of correct practical life, so we can look back on our lives while reading, or in other words, while living, we can use reading to help our life practice. It is not enough to only pay attention to (the individual facts that are pressing on one's head), but it is still very empty to only pay attention to the principles that the books point out to us. We must be able to automatically find the truth from our own life practice, pay attention to analyzing the individual facts that are pressing on our heads, find deeper meanings from the individual facts, and not be deceived by the surface of the facts. For example, buying a cigarette from a foreign company, we feel that it is cheaper than a Chinese-made cigarette, but if we analyze it, we know that this cheap cigarette represents foreign economic aggression, it sucks the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people, and the value is greater than the cheapness we get on a cigarette. This example tells us that even small individual facts such as a cigarette contain serious and deep meanings, but if we do not analyze them, we will naturally be deceived by them. As for the individual facts in individual life, they are more important than a cigarette, and the meaning is even greater when analyzed. We do not completely oppose people paying attention to individual facts, we only oppose those who are only satisfied with the superficial meaning of facts without analyzing them. If you want to analyze the facts in front of you, books are helpful, but you cannot stick to book knowledge. We must always treat books as a helper and always base ourselves on our own life practice. The knowledge in individual life is sometimes richer than books, and the knowledge gained in life practice is true knowledge, living knowledge. Finally, when it comes to reading, it is not necessary to read too much. As long as you can choose the most practical books for your life and the most basic books, you can get a lot of benefits from very few books. But this belongs to the problem of reading methods, we have talked a lot, and we may talk about it later, but we will not talk about it in this topic. The facts pressing on our heads are of course not only reading. We plan to discuss the other aspects of life contradictions in detail in another letter. I won't say it now.</p>

Mr. Wu Junsheng, Director of the Department of Education of our school, is highly specialized. We intend to invite him to join the discussion. May I ask you to telegraph back? The proposal of Jiang Menglin and others, (amending the primary and secondary school education system by means of experimentation to adapt to national conditions), is recorded below,</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Since the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, our country's education has gradually entered the right track and has made rapid progress, especially in primary and secondary schools. However, the development is too rapid, and there are inevitable imbalances. The education system must adapt to the times, remedy shortcomings, and make it possible to meet the needs of the country at all times. Therefore, there are several points in the current primary and secondary school system that need to be reconsidered, which are listed below. (1) The current primary and secondary school system is rather excessively focused on the aspect of further education, but in fact, the majority of students cannot go on to further education. According to the 19th year of education statistics, there are 914,5822 students in elementary schools, 1,396,704 in higher elementary schools, 40,118 in junior high schools, and 106,491 in senior high schools. That is, only about one-seventh of the students can go from elementary school to higher elementary school, less than one-third can go from higher elementary school to junior high school, and only one-quarter can go from junior high school to senior high school. If the number of elementary school students is compared with that of colleges and above (44,000 people), only one out of 207 students can go from elementary school to university. It is inappropriate to make elementary schools preparatory schools for middle schools and middle schools preparatory schools for universities for the sake of this one person. Moreover, most students who cannot go on to further education will either become unemployed or learn things that are not useful after graduation because they have no occupational preparation, and both personal livelihood and social undertakings will suffer losses. This is the first point that should be reconsidered. (2) In recent years, rural bankruptcy has shaken the foundation of the country. It is not only necessary to speed up the reduction of rural construction in a passive way. If we want to seek rural construction, education must first cultivate new farmers with knowledge as a preparation for using scientific methods to increase production. However, according to the current system, students go from rural areas to cities (elementary school to middle school), and from cities to provincial capitals and metropolises (middle school to university). After graduation, they are unwilling to return to the fields. If this continues, not only will there be no talent for rural construction, but there will also be many floating children in the provinces and cities. Children in rural areas go to cities to study industry and commerce, which can directly and indirectly benefit rural areas. However, the capacity of cities is limited, and rural construction needs people. The education system must take into account both considerations, so that rural and urban areas develop in interdependence. It is inappropriate to favor one over the other. This is the second point that should be reconsidered. (3) Our country's education system and curriculum often copy foreign countries. The situations in various countries are different. We should revise the education system and compile the curriculum based on the actual social conditions in order to meet the special needs of the country. For example, elementary schools only know how to focus on book knowledge, the curriculum is excessive, and even hinders children's education. On the contrary, daily life, which has been used in our country to teach children sweeping, answering, advancing, and retreating, and to cultivate their fundamental character, is not paid attention to. Also, the harm of the old-fashioned science has not been eliminated, and studying is still aimed at becoming an official. Therefore, life skills, such as home industry and women's domestic science, are despised. This is a special psychology in our country that must be corrected. Furthermore, compulsory education has been advocated for many years, but it has not yet been implemented. Although there are many reasons, such as the poverty of our country's wealth and the suffering of the people, and the lack of teachers, etc., it is indeed impossible for our country's compulsory education to be compared with other countries' fixed six years or even eight years. We must take into account the national conditions and re-establish measures to make it easy to learn from the top to the bottom. This is the third point that should be reconsidered. (4) From the standpoint of higher education, the current middle school system also has many shortcomings. After graduating from high school and entering university or college, the training of basic knowledge cannot meet the needs of the university. On the one hand, it is because of the insecurity of the university itself, and on the other hand, it is because of the lack of sufficient preparation for Chinese, foreign languages, and teaching in high school. In previous years, universities had preparatory courses, and these shortcomings could be remedied within two years. Now that the preparatory courses have been abolished, the source of university students relies entirely on middle schools. Therefore, in order for university students to have sufficient preparation for specialized knowledge and skills, it is necessary to start with reforming the middle school curriculum and training. This is the fourth point that should be reconsidered.</p>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>In summary of the above sections, I respectfully submit the following proposals: (1) Based on recent statistics, the advancement-oriented education system is designed for only a minority of students, and it must be revised. Aside from maintaining the current system as a separate track specifically for the minority of students who will pursue higher education, a separate system should be available for the majority of students. At each level of education, there should be a point where students with varying circumstances can choose schools suited to their abilities and economic conditions. The goal is to ensure that upon graduation, they possess sound habits and practical skills.</p>
<p>(2) The common perception is that elementary and secondary schools are divided into segments, but in reality, the transitions between lower and upper elementary school, and lower and upper secondary school, are more critical stages. This is because the number of students progressing from lower to upper elementary school, and from lower to upper secondary school, is lower than the number progressing from upper elementary school to lower secondary school and from upper secondary school to university. Since the majority of lower elementary and lower secondary school students do not continue their education, the focus of education must be on this point, ensuring that the education received by these students is complete in itself. Not only should general elementary schools not be preparatory schools for secondary schools, and general secondary schools not be preparatory schools for universities, but also lower elementary curricula should not be preparatory curricula for upper elementary school, and lower secondary curricula should not be preparatory curricula for upper secondary school. Based on the natural stages dictated by the national economic situation, it can be inferred that in the future, the majority of educated citizens will be those who have completed or not completed four years of lower elementary school. As four years of lower elementary school form the foundation of national education, its curriculum must be complete in itself and not designed for higher education. The textbook curriculum must be reduced, and life skills education must be increased, emphasizing the development of literacy and expressive abilities, as well as civic knowledge and moral training. In urban areas, teach them about family industries and small business knowledge; in rural areas, teach them about rural family industries and rural general knowledge, etc. The goal is to ensure that after graduation, they become citizens who can support themselves even without pursuing further education.</p>
<p>(3) After the above-mentioned four years of elementary education, further education should be divided into multiple tracks. One track leads from the current system to upper elementary and secondary schools, and then to specialized schools or higher education institutions (details in Article 5). A second track consists of two-year vocational schools (after graduating from upper elementary school). A third track consists of junior vocational schools (after graduating from lower secondary school). A fourth track consists of senior vocational schools (after graduating from upper secondary school). In vocational schools, production skills training must be provided based on local agricultural and industrial conditions. The focus should be on practical work, supplemented by textbooks, so that the majority of students who cannot enter regular schools become citizens with production skills. Therefore, vocational schools should focus on factory life rather than classroom life. Factory (or farm) equipment should be practical, and teachers should be able to genuinely work and design before students are admitted. Current nominal vocational schools that use textbooks as vocational materials must be strictly banned to avoid hindering the development of legitimate vocational schools. Note: The junior, middle, and senior levels of vocational schools correspond to upper elementary, lower secondary, and upper secondary school levels, respectively. Junior vocational schools accept graduates of four-year elementary schools, with a study period of two years, which does not pose a problem. There are two ways to admit students to middle and senior vocational schools. The first method is for middle vocational schools to admit junior vocational school graduates, and senior vocational schools to admit middle vocational school graduates. The second method is to admit graduates of four-year elementary schools, with study periods of five and eight years, respectively. If the first method is followed, the three levels of vocational schools will be consistent, making it convenient for students to advance. If the second method is followed, the five- and eight-year vocational schools can provide deeper training in vocational foundation subjects in the early years. Comparing the two methods, the second method seems more appropriate. The duration of each level of vocational school may not need to be fixed in order to adapt to the nature of various occupations and local conditions.</p>
<p>(4) The above system is designed to meet the needs of children entering school. As for children who have missed school, measures must be taken to provide them with simple compulsory education. The number of school-age children is approximately 15% of the total population (according to a survey in Japan in 1925, the proportion of school-age children to the total population was slightly over 16%; according to a survey in Jiangsu Province in 1930, the proportion was 15%). Based on this, there are approximately 50 million out-of-school children in our country. We must not allow these 50 million children to continue missing school. However, due to China's economic decline, compulsory education should not be too long. Also, since the majority of out-of-school children are in rural areas, they must work and study simultaneously for the implementation to be effective. Assuming compulsory education is set at one to two years, and using half-day schools where children can work and study at the same time, schools can accommodate twice as many students. Alternatively, winter schools can be established to allow children to attend school during the agricultural off-season. During these one to two years, they will be taught simple literacy and basic reading materials, drawing from agricultural knowledge, civic knowledge, and family hygiene, etc. After several years of implementation, illiteracy can first be eliminated. Then, based on national economic development, the duration of compulsory education can be extended. (Note) Three-year compulsory elementary schools can be implemented according to the "Implementation Measures for Short-Term Compulsory Education" promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Above the short-term compulsory elementary school, supplementary schools can be established so that graduates have the opportunity to receive supplementary education in their spare time to compensate for the shortcomings of elementary school training. Regarding the large number of teachers required for implementation, it is not necessary to limit them to normal school students. Those who have graduated from elementary or secondary schools should be given one to several years of rigorous training, teaching them national education policies, civics, and agricultural knowledge, etc. After graduation, they will be sent to serve in various rural areas. In this way, on the one hand, the number of unemployed students can be reduced, and on the other hand, a large number of teachers can be trained for rural areas.</p>
<p>(5) Vocational schools equivalent to upper elementary, lower secondary, and upper secondary school levels are separated from preparatory schools for universities. These preparatory schools (i.e., the current education system) should also be reorganized. These schools should admit lower elementary school graduates, combining three years of upper secondary school, three years of lower secondary school, and two years of upper elementary school, for a total of eight years. The curriculum should be based on the preparation for specialized knowledge and skills. During these eight years, continuous and rigorous training should be provided in Chinese, foreign languages, and mathematics. The goal is to ensure that after graduation, students are fluent and clear in Chinese, can speak, write, and communicate in the first foreign language, can read reference books in the second foreign language, and can apply mathematics to various sciences. The schools themselves should be established in segments or continuously, depending on local conditions. Strict management to cultivate disciplined habits and emphasis on physical education to ensure physical and mental well-being are, of course, self-evident. (Note) The eight-year secondary school can still be divided into segments, but the curriculum of each segment is consistent, aiming to prepare students for university education. If secondary school students cannot pursue further education due to changes in interest or family circumstances, they can transfer to vocational schools and find remedial measures in the curriculum within the vocational schools. If the secondary school and vocational school curricula are forced to accommodate each other, as in the past, the fundamental purpose of separate training will be lost. The issue of whether secondary schools should specialize should also be considered. In countries such as Germany and France, secondary schools are divided into groups or schools based on subjects. However, the specialization is based on the emphasis on ancient or modern languages, not on liberal arts or sciences. For example, in Germany, the Gymnasium emphasizes ancient languages, while the Real Gymnasium emphasizes modern languages. Both schools place equal emphasis on both liberal arts and science. In French secondary schools, Group A emphasizes ancient languages, while Group B emphasizes modern languages. Otherwise, the curricula are identical. Since Chinese secondary schools do not study Greek or Latin, the issue of specialization does not arise. In the past, specialization based on liberal arts or science seemed to have lost the fundamental purpose of general training.</p>
<p>(6) Scholarships: After graduating from four years of elementary school, a test should be held to identify students with the aptitude and ability to pursue further education. These students should be awarded scholarships for secondary or vocational schools, which should continue until graduation. After graduating from secondary school, a test should be held to award scholarships. The number of scholarships should be large enough to enable the majority of secondary school graduates who can be trained to complete their university studies and achieve the goal of talent education. The connection between one- or two-year compulsory elementary schools and four-year elementary schools should also be considered. Excellent students who graduate from one- or two-year compulsory elementary schools should also be assisted with scholarships to enter four-year elementary schools, so that they have the opportunity to gradually advance. Only in this way can potential talent be prevented from being buried.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>For the sake of prudence, we do not advocate immediate changes. The above-mentioned four-year elementary schools, two-year upper elementary schools, three-year lower and upper secondary vocational schools, one- to two-year compulsory education, and eight-year preparatory secondary schools for universities can be selected in suitable locations in both urban and rural areas for pilot testing. After the methods prove effective, they can be promoted to other areas. The key to the success or failure of these pilot tests lies in the training and selection of teachers. A separate plan must be developed for the methods of teacher training and selection. (Respectfully,) The Ministry of Education has decided to make changes.</p>
<h3>High School Curriculum Time</h3>
<p>As a result of discussions between the Directorate of Education and Training over the past few days, specific measures for implementing three months of centralized military training for students in high schools and above have been agreed upon and will be implemented starting in 1934. These measures will not be made public for the time being as they relate to military training. As the centralized military training time conflicts with the curriculum time allocation table for high schools, vocational schools, and normal schools originally set by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education will redistribute the curriculum time for these schools and will issue an order to the provincial and municipal education departments to instruct the schools to comply. - Staff Member of the Ministry of Education's Boy Scout Training Program</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Training Class</h3>
<p>▲ Chairman Hao Gengsheng Encourages Students ▲ Dai Chuanxian and Duan Xipeng Deliver Training Speeches (Nanjing, 18th) The Ministry of Education's Boy Scout Instructor Training Class was concluded a week earlier than scheduled because the members had to return to their schools to prepare for the start of the school year. A group photo was taken at 8:00 a.m. on the 18th, and the graduation ceremony was held at 9:00 a.m. Chairman Hao Gengsheng briefly stated that this class has more than 400 people, representing 25 provinces and cities. Such a gathering is not easy. In the past five weeks, we have worked together and sacrificed our personal opinions to achieve great success. Now that we are about to part, your responsibilities are very heavy. I hope that you will strive for the country and the people based on the Boy Scout oath and rules. Dean Dai Chuanxian explained the Chinese Boy Scout rules and oath in detail and gave words of encouragement. Deputy Minister Duan Xipeng explained the Ministry of Education's future improvement methods and determination for the Boy Scouts, and hoped that the university would seek the overall development of the military chapter. The closing ceremony was held at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Funding Office's Letter to the Department of Education</h3>
<p>▲ Orders to All Counties to Comply with Regulations and Allocate Special Provincial Education Funds The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office yesterday sent a public letter to the Jiangsu Department of Education, requesting strict orders to all counties to earnestly comply with the regulations and allocate special provincial education funds starting in 1934. The original letter stated: "This office has investigated that the education funding of this province, under the item of land tax, was previously ordered by the provincial government to all counties to implement independent allocation and special storage of funds. Therefore, many counties in 1933 were able to clear their accounts on a monthly basis, and the old debts of provincial schools were able to be partially compensated. Unexpectedly, since the summer of this year, the weather has been severely dry, affecting the lives of farmers. Some outgoing county magistrates of Jurong, County Magistrate Yan, the current County Magistrate Zhong of Yixing, County Magistrate Chen of Liyang, etc., have taken the excuse of light collections and arbitrarily diverted the collected special provincial education funds for county administrative purposes, destroying the independence of education funding, which is not in accordance with the regulations. In other counties, there are also cases of procrastination in remitting funds over time. At the beginning of this academic year, there are difficulties due to the limited funds available. The provincial education budget and the county local budget each have their own funds that should be spent, and the boundaries are clear and there is no confusion. If the collections are indeed light, the province and counties are equally difficult, and it seems inappropriate to focus on one and lose sight of the other, favoring the county and making the province bear the brunt. Moreover, this special land tax fund is completely allocated from the provincial general tax that should be remitted by the counties to the Department of Finance, and independent implementation was originally intended to permanently prevent diversion. Now, as this fund belongs to the province, the provincial government does not divert it, but the county government can arbitrarily divert it. The county magistrates are well aware of the matter and should know that it is not allowed by law. It is the duty of this office, witnessing that the disaster situation in various counties this year is very serious, and the income of special funds has already sharply decreased. If the collected funds are allowed to be arbitrarily used by the counties, if this example is not eliminated, the funding of provincial schools will be even more difficult to maintain in the future. What the office feels to be dangerous must be truthfully communicated. It is hoped that your department will investigate, consider the situation, and immediately submit a plan to the provincial government to maintain the plan, and quickly issue orders to all counties to strictly implement the allocation of special provincial education funds in accordance with the old regulations, implement the storage of special funds, and remit funds as they are collected, with clear boundaries, and guarantee independence. Regardless of any needs or special circumstances, it is not allowed to arbitrarily divert funds on the pretext of natural disasters. If there is any non-compliance, strict penalties should be stipulated and measures should be taken to order compensation and ensure permanent compliance, so as to serve as a warning. Furthermore, each county such as Chongming, Qidong, Yizheng, Donghai, Guanyun, and Shuyang either does not report remittances or only remits a small amount, and the expansion of debts is huge and cannot be cleared. Please also strictly order them to earnestly comply with the regulations and remit funds on a monthly basis starting in 1934. The future of provincial education depends greatly on this."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Forms to Investigate Social Education Funds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The Ministry of Education has formulated two types of forms to investigate social education funds, ordering provinces, counties, and municipalities to report social education funds within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders the Adoption of Baoquan New Rulers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The Ministry of Education approved the Ministry of Industry's submission of thousands of advertisements for new rulers from the Shanghai Baoquan Craft Factory, requesting that they be distributed for purchase and use. The Ministry specially issued a general order on the 18th to all provincial and municipal education departments to instruct their subordinates to adopt them uniformly. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education Jointly Appoint</p>
<h3>Members of the Nurses Education Committee</h3>
<p>In order to effectively rectify the national nurse education, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education jointly issued regulations for the joint establishment of the Nurses Education Committee last month. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education jointly appointed Chen Zhubihui, Hu Dunwu, Shi Xien, Liu Ganqing, Wang Yuanchen, Zhao Shiqing and six other people to be members of the Nurses Education Committee yesterday. Jin Baoshan and Pan Jingzhi were sent by the Health Department of the Ministry of Interior, and Gu Shusen and Zhong Zuan were sent by the Ministry of Education to be members of the committee. The first meeting will be convened as soon as the date is decided. Sichuan's Education Still Has No Progress</p>
<h3>Most of the Education Funds are Transferred to Military Expenses</h3>
<p>▲ Teachers' Salaries are Calculated for Only Three Months per Semester He Lian'en, the principal of the Sichuan Provincial First Normal School, came to Shanghai on official business. The reporter of the Huadong News Agency met him at his residence. According to him, although education in Sichuan is now more developed than two or three years ago, it still shows little achievement due to financial difficulties. Most of the education funds are still transferred to military expenses due to the tense situation of bandit suppression. Teachers' salaries are paid for only three months every six months, university professors receive 1.6 yuan per class, and secondary schools receive only 80 cents. In addition to the three universities, there are a total of eleven secondary schools and normal schools, and only more than 500 primary schools.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Points in the Entrance Examination of Two Private Secondary Schools, Shimin and Haimen</h3>
<p>The excellence of the results is unprecedented. The Department of Education Ordered to Send Staff to Test After the Start of School. After the second entrance examination of the general courses of Jiangsu High School, the results were evaluated separately. The Suzhou Department of Education recently received reports from the grading committee of each subject, stating that there were many suspicious points in the examination papers of the two private secondary schools, Shimin and Haimen. The department believes that school examinations are extremely important, so it issued separate instructions to the two schools yesterday (17th), ordering them to wait for staff to be sent to the school for retesting. The original text of the department's instructions to the two schools is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Instructions to Shimin Secondary School The results of the second entrance examination of the general courses of Jiangsu High School have been evaluated separately. Among the 39 candidates from the school, 29 had a total average of over 80 points, 12 had over 70 points, and all were admitted. The excellence of the results is deeply surprising. The grading committee of each subject has repeatedly reported that there are many suspicious points in the examination papers of the school, and a thorough investigation should be conducted to emphasize the importance of examination administration. It is believed that school examinations are extremely important, and the head of the family is the chief examiner. However, he does not understand the meaning of the examination, causing people to talk about it, which is a serious oversight and should be reprimanded. As for the 39 students admitted to the school, the department will send staff to the school to conduct a test after the start of the school. All test subjects and questions will be determined temporarily by the department to show prudence. The names and scores of all admitted students should be listed separately. Order the principal of the school to immediately inform and post a notice to inform all. This order.</p>
<p>▲ Instructions to Haimen Secondary School The results of the second entrance examination of the general courses of Jiangsu High School have been evaluated separately. Among the 67 candidates from the school, 63 passed and only 4 failed. Among the passed students, except for Wu Ke, Wang Zengwang, Jiang Yifei and other three people because of poor conduct, the school requested that they not be admitted. There are still 60 people including Liu Fengying who should be admitted together. The excellence of the results is unprecedented since school examinations have been held. The grading committee of each subject has repeatedly reported that there are many suspicious points in the examination papers of the school, and a thorough investigation should be conducted to emphasize the importance of examination administration. In addition, after the examination committee Huang Boqin personally supervised the three subjects of Party Principles, Chinese, and History on the last day of the examination, the results were very mediocre. Compared with the results of the subjects taken in the previous two days, the results were very different. People are talking about it, and it is not without reason. The chief examiner was completely unaware, which is a serious oversight and should be reprimanded. As for the 60 students including Liu Fengying who have already been admitted, the department will send staff to the school to conduct a test after the start of the school. All test subjects and questions will be determined temporarily by the department to show prudence. Order the names and scores of all admitted students should be listed separately. Order the principal of the school to immediately inform and post a notice to inform all. This order.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Children and Toys</h3>
<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Among the desires of childhood, besides appetite, the next is the desire for toys. Look! Many boys and girls, poor and rich, big and small children, which one does not have their favorite toy, playing with it every day, like life.</p>
<p>In the city, the types and names of toys are too numerous to count; children pick their favorite toys to buy, play, and collect. Every parent, when searching their children's small property, can at least find several or even dozens of toys collected like treasures, which shows the close relationship between children and toys.</p>
<p>However, children! Where do your toys come from? Humph! Most of them are foreign goods. Whether it's a small car, marbles, a small airplane, a tumbler, a rubber animal... and other things. Nineteen out of ten are imports; especially cheap goods, no wonder the import statistics of games and toys in the first six months of this year reached a shocking record of more than 570,000 yuan! This cannot be considered a huge expenditure in this poor and financially exhausted country.</p>
<p>Children! Don't rely solely on the inventions of foreigners and enjoy them as much as you can. You also have to think about the entire China. Can it afford such purchasing power? In young times, there are smart brains and omnipotent hands; as long as you spend a little brainpower and time, wouldn't you invent a toy in the same way? Why rely on foreigners!</p>
<h3>(Scolding) and (Hitting)</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Putting insulting words on others is (scolding people).</p>
<p>Putting the force of fists and feet on others is (hitting people).</p>
<p>Scolding people is not good for oneself; hitting people is not good for oneself either. If you are scolded for scolding others, and beaten for hitting others, it will not only not be beneficial but will also suffer losses!</p>
<p>Confucius's children did not know how to scold, and Zengzi's children did not know how to get angry, which are all worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>If others have made mistakes, we can advise them; if others want to scold or beat us, we can be tolerant; in this way, we can make the other party feel ashamed and retreat on their own, avoiding many unnecessary troubles.</p>
<p>I am not advocating (learning to take a loss), but I am respectfully advising all children to cultivate more spirit of harmony and love, and do more practical work; know that those who like to scold others are scolding themselves! Those who like to hit others are hitting themselves!</p>
<p>Children: From today onwards, let's use the time spent on scolding and hitting on our studies.</p>
<h3>Watermelon</h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Watermelon lantern, shining bright, quality is rounder and more jade-like than a pearl, carving flowers and characters, concentrating the mind, the craftsmanship is comparable to fine arts, preserve it completely, strive to avoid being divided.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Big watermelon, floats on the water, some people don't know the wonder of it, weighing the melon for quality, calculating how much it weighs, it's lighter than (water of the same volume), this is called specific gravity, you must know it and remember it well.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In the past, Hai Rui was always honest and incorruptible, thirsty on the journey without tea to drink, he went to a melon garden, with watermelons in front of him, the garden owner was not to be seen at this time, so he picked a melon to eat, tying melon money to the vine.</p>
<p>(Hai Rui, a man of the Ming Dynasty, was unyielding in office)</p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>(Daddy, is it called tomorrow now?) Min'er hopped and skipped to her father in the room and said this to him.</p>
<p>(No, my child.) Her father said with a smile: (You can't call it tomorrow now.)</p>
<p>(Why did you think of calling it tomorrow now? Min'er.) Her father asked gently.</p>
<p>(Yes, Daddy, didn't you say yesterday: tomorrow is Sunday, and the Children's Weekly will be published again, today is exactly Sunday, and the Children's Weekly has also been published, so it must be called tomorrow now.) Min'er said.</p>
<p>Her father smiled again and said; (Now is yesterday's tomorrow, but now we must call it today. For example: now we can say tomorrow is Monday, but when Monday arrives, we must say tomorrow is Tuesday again.)</p>
<p>Later, Min'er thought and thought and said: (In this way, then tomorrow will never come.)</p>
<h3>Eyes Deceive People</h3>
<p>— Ren Chaojun</p>
<p>Isn't this topic very strange to children? Can eyes deceive people? Children must not believe it, thinking that whatever the eyes see is how it is, but that is not right.</p>
<p>What color is the sun? Children will definitely say it is white, but that is not right, we are deceived by the eyes. The sun has color; it is composed of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. Because the sun rotates very quickly in the air, it becomes white. If the children don't believe it, they can point a mirror at the sun and reflect the light on the wall, and there will be a beautiful colorful light. If you look closely, there will be these seven colors. If these seven colors are evenly distributed and pasted on a rotating disc, and you shake it vigorously, it will turn white.</p>
<p>On this picture, it is even more obvious that eyes can deceive people. In Figure 1, A and B are like two lines, but they are one. In Figure 2, the shape of B seems to be larger than the shape of A, but if you measure it, they are equal. In Figure 3, AB and BC are equal, but it looks like AB is larger than BC. In Figure 4, 6, it seems that all A are smaller than B, but in fact they are equal. In Figure 5, it is a square, but drawing a few arcs seems to flatten it.</p>
<p>Looking at it from above, aren't eyes unreliable? Children, no matter what you look at, you need to consider it and not trust your eyes too much. (See attached picture)</p>
<h3>Naughty Wang Er</h3>

<p>1 Wang Er's dad is repairing the wireless motor, 2 Why not plug it in? 3 Let's try it! 4 Ah yo! You little pig!</p>
<h3>One Summer Evening</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>The fire-like sun gradually fell from the horizon. The bright moon and sparkling stars emitted bright light in the sky; the humans on the ground had all finished their dinner and were talking eloquently under the stars and moon.</p>
<p>I sat alone on the bluestone under the willow tree, very calm, and looked at the stars and moon that shone brightly in the sky. I only heard the sound of the river flowing and the sound of the cool breeze blowing the leaves, and also the calls of frogs and a few insects. Other than that, I heard nothing! In this lonely atmosphere, I thought of the classmates I hadn't seen for two or three years. Her face, her actions, and everything else revolved in my mind one by one. I still haven't forgotten the words she said to me when we parted. She helped me in school in every way. If I didn't understand the lessons, she would always explain them wholeheartedly until I understood them, and then she would feel at ease. During the breaks, she and I often played games together on a small lawn, never separating for a moment. But until now, she hasn't even sent a letter. I wonder if she is still studying at that school? I wonder if she has moved now? I always want to find an opportunity to know everything about her. I was thinking wildly like this when I suddenly felt someone pat my shoulder. It turned out that my younger sister was calling me to go to bed in the room.</p>
<h3>Several Interesting Arithmetic Problems</h3>
<p>— Chao</p>
<p>Children! Maybe you won't believe that even arithmetic problems can be interesting! Isn't that so? The most annoying subject in the curriculum is arithmetic. It is both boring and difficult to deal with. If you don't do it well, you will fail, and sometimes it even causes problems with grade promotion. I think children must hate it. In order to eliminate the aversion between children and arithmetic, I have written the following interesting arithmetic problems:</p>
<p>The first question seems to be division. The question is very simple, saying that there are ten feet of cloth. Assuming that one foot is cut off every day, how many days will it take to cut it all? Children will definitely answer that it will take ten days to cut it all, because dividing ten by one is still ten! But that's wrong. The answer is not ten but nine. If it were ten, there would be nothing interesting to say. Of course, this must be explained clearly. Children, think about it. After cutting the ten feet of cloth for eight days, only two feet are left. On the ninth day, one cut will turn it into two feet. There is no need to cut it again on the tenth day. Isn't nine days enough?</p>
<p>The second question assumes that there are ten crows on a tree. A hunter shoots down one with a gun. How many crows are left on the tree? Children will definitely shout with great confidence that there are nine left. Isn't ten minus one nine? However, you are wrong again, because when the gunshot sounds, won't the others fly away? So the correct answer should be zero.</p>
<p>The third question is also very simple. It says that in a ten-zhang long road, a tree is planted every one zhang. How many trees need to be planted in total? This is even easier. The road is ten zhang long, so of course only ten trees can be planted. Children must also think so, but it is still not right, and it is unexpectedly possible to plant eleven trees! Because a tree must be planted at the beginning and end of the road, plus nine trees in the middle, isn't that eleven trees?</p>
<p>After reading the above three questions, children probably feel that they are interesting! Because the answers are very unexpected, and yet so reasonable. So I advise all children not to hate mathematics. It also has its own fun!</p>
<h3>Clay Man and Wax Man Compete to Be Brothers</h3>
<p>— Ju Gao</p>
<p>Little clay man, little wax man, no distinction between length and size, originally a pair of good friends, because they both want to be older brothers, they keep complaining.</p>
<p>The little clay man said: (My body is very heavy, and the wind doesn't shake me; your quality is too light, and your mouth will swell when you fall. Your skills are not as good as mine, you should let me be the older brother.)</p>
<p>The little wax man said: (Although I am light, I can swim, and it is fun to float in the water; your body is too heavy, and you will be useless if it rains. Your skills are not as good as mine, you should still let me be the older brother.)</p>
<p>The little clay man said: (The owner loves me and doesn't love you, because you sleep with him, and when you wake up, you will break your hands and legs. Your skills are not as good as mine, you shouldn't compete to be the older brother.)</p>
<p>The little wax man said: (The owner loves me and doesn't love you, because I can tie a balloon to my body and go to the sky immediately to pick a few stars. Your skills are not as good as mine, you shouldn't compete to be the older brother.)</p>
<p>The little owner was doing some clipping, heard them complaining, and quickly came over to persuade them: (Those who are younger, be younger brothers, those who are older, be older brothers, you can't say how old you are, so no one can be the older brother.)</p>
<p>The little clay man and the little wax man, after hearing the fair words, lowered their heads, closed their mouths, felt ashamed, held hands, and were still a pair of good friends.</p>
<h3>Interesting Records</h3>
<p>— Tao Ran</p>
<p>In our world, they are the same kind of animals and the same kind of life, but the length of life is very different. Let's sort out the records of different lifespans of these animals, and we find it very interesting.</p>
<p>The longest-lived animal in the world is the turtle. The age of a turtle is at least 200 to 300 years, and the higher lifespan is 500 years. If we compare the age of a turtle with the lifespan of a mayfly, then I really don't know how many tens of millions of times the difference is!</p>
<p>The lifespan of a mayfly is the shortest among animals, lasting only five hours from birth to death.</p>
<p>The lifespan of a cicada is from two days to forty days, usually around thirty days. It is also considered a short-lived animal.</p>
<p>Among the long-lived animals, the crocodile has 250 years, and the carp has 200 years, both of which are second to the age of the turtle.</p>
<p>(Human life is a hundred years), this is still the lifespan of ancient people.</p>
<p>The average lifespan of people now is generally around fifty or sixty years old. Compared to the ancients, it has been shortened a lot.</p>
<p>Cranes and ostriches can both live to fifty or sixty years old, which is about the same length as human life.</p>
<p>Among birds, the longest-lived should be the parrot. The lifespan of the parrot is the longest. There are also one hundred and fifty years. Next is the kite, which also has a lifespan of one hundred years. These are all much longer than human life.</p>
<h3>Rural Little Friends' Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>▲ Farmers Under the Scorching Heat</p>
<p>Dear little friends:</p>
<p>The fiery sun beats down, causing sweat to stream down the backs of farmers toiling shirtless in the fields. The old oxen pant, drawing water in the waterwheels. The farmers, wearing straw hats, bail water. Pitifully, they exhaust their energy, unable to withstand the sun's scorching heat. The rivers have dried up enough to walk across. They yearn for clouds and rain. Heaven seems deliberately to make things difficult, showing no sign of rain. The rice seedlings gradually wither. The farmers sigh, anxious!</p>
<p>When everyone is united in hoping for rain, farmers build mud dragons dozens of feet long, burning incense and offering prayers. Little children, naked, smear themselves with mud, pretending to be water ghosts, running around with willow branches in their hands, believing that (rain) will then pour down. We know this is a superstitious act, but you can imagine the general drought in the countryside.</p>
<p>At night, because the earth reflects the heat, the farmers who have worked hard all day cannot sleep soundly. Everyone sits under the trees or in front of the threshing ground, enjoying the cool breeze, telling stories, and discussing the principles of farming. Sometimes, on very hot nights, they cannot even close their eyes, as mosquitoes suck their blood. When the sky turns milky white, they carry their farm tools to the fields again. Ah! Hardworking and pitiful farmers!</p>

<h3>How to Make a Moving Figure?</h3>
<p>— Wan Hu Zhao</p>
<p>Little friends, the method for making a moving figure is very easy and simple, taking only a little over an hour. The fun, however, is great. The diagrams and explanations here are very detailed, so look carefully and follow them.</p>
<p>Instructions: Take a piece of stiff cardboard and draw the shape of a person's upper body and limbs with a pencil (Figure 1). Then, use scissors to cut along the lines, separating the person's upper body and limbs. Next, use an awl to poke small holes according to the black dots in (Figure 2). Use copper wire to connect the lower limbs, not too tightly, so they can move. Connect the upper limbs to the fist holes with short copper wire, as shown in (Figure 3). The upper and lower ends must be in opposite directions. Otherwise, it will not be easy to move! Further, take a thin bamboo stick, round it, and near one end, cut it into a groove. The other end can be made into a spear shape (Figure 4). Further, use short copper wire to tie to the bottom of the groove of the spear, one end through the right hand fist hole, and the other end into the left hand fist hole, allowing movement. See (Figure 5). Finally, bend the copper wire into a (?) shape, pass it through the right shoulder hole and the scapula hole, and out from the left scapula hole, then twist it again as before. The copper wire should move very flexibly. At this point, you can use copper wire to connect the copper wire of the shoulder hole and pass it through one end of the pen tube to make it firm, and then you can play with it (Figure 6).</p>
<p>(P.S.) When playing, hold the end of the pen tube and rotate it. You will see the paper figure waving a spear, its movements agile, as if it were a great general.</p>
<p>If you paint it with colorful colors, it will look even better.</p>

<p>Rumors Spread of Increased Silver Export Tax</p>
<h3>Bullion Speculation: The Shorts' Formation Collapses</h3>
<p>▲ Increase... Fourteen Yuan and Nine Jiao ▲ Yesterday, the gold market was very firm because of reports that our Ministry of Finance had invited experts to consider stopping the outflow of silver. In fact, because of the continued stability, the psychology of the shorts was shaken, and large investors aggressively covered their short positions. The longs were calm, and the general formation of the shorts was suddenly broken. The buying frenzy intensified, and coupled with the extraordinary tightness in the foreign exchange market, gold prices soared, breaking through the two major levels of fifty and sixty yuan in succession. Initially, the overseas silver market was reported to be weakening in England and stable in America, and the exchange rate was rising. American cotton fell 18 points, and American wheat fell slightly. The opening price of spot goods was slightly lower at 47.8 yuan, but the news favored speculation, and the situation was unusually stable. After the opening, because speculator Luo suddenly came in to cover positions, Chinese merchants vigorously bought American exchange, pushing through 50 yuan. However, because HSBC quoted English at par and American up 1.25, there was still a struggle. Because the market was firm, Chinese merchants bought aggressively again and again. The exchange market was therefore extremely tight, and major investors' buying intentions were very strong. Shorts scrambled to cover their positions, and the gold market gradually rose to the 60-yuan mark. Then, seeing the high price, there was a slight supply, and retail investors aggressively pressed down. Banks also took the opportunity to supply at a high price. Reuters reported that Western banks in the local area were continuing preparations for the export of a large batch of silver, reportedly 30,000,000 yuan, which would be shipped out this month, and informed downstream. However, HSBC's quotations changed and weakened. Major investors maintained their position, the market remained firm, and the price rose again. Rumors in the market that the silver export tax would be increased were rampant, and the shorts were panicked, fearing that exchange rates would become extremely tight. The gold market became even firmer, breaking through the 60-yuan mark. However, Reuters reported that the US Treasury Department, based on the law of nationalizing silver, announced new management regulations for silver, requiring all private silver holdings to be reported before September 15, and that silver certificates totaling 11,476,508 yuan had already left the Treasury Department. There was still a struggle, but finally, because Chinese merchants bought aggressively, the exchange market repeatedly weakened, the market dried up, and the buying frenzy continued to intensify, rising again. Banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the market closed slightly lower. The price of pure gold increased by about 13 yuan. After the price of bullion rose, the "plus water" (premium) collapsed. The discount for forward contracts for September and October was within one yuan. Today's situation for the half-day market is recorded below. The morning opening was 948.3 yuan, down 0.6 yuan from the previous close. The opening price of goods was the same. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for English exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 625, and American exchange at 35.3125 yuan. Speculator Luo was the first to cover his short positions, and the market immediately became firm. Dealers such as Yuan Mao Yong, Zheng Chang Qian, and Chang Xiang vigorously bought, pushing the price above 50 yuan. Heng Yu and Qing Yu also bought, pushing the price up to 1.6 yuan. Mitsui offered American dollars for October at 375, anticipating that HSBC would quote English at par and American up 1.25. Hongli, Yifeng, and Yongfu Chang sold, dropping to 0.3 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang, Zheng Chang Heng Yu, Shunfa Daxing, Yong Yu, Qing Yong, Bingxing Yifeng, and Yong all bought aggressively, raising the price again to 2.2 yuan. Yuan Chang Yong, Yuanxing, and Zhaofeng Chang sold, falling back to 1.3 yuan. Dealers such as Yuansheng Yong, Yifeng Yong, Hongxing Dafayong, Qing Yu Heng Yu, Hengtai Fuyu, Tongchun Yiyu, and Tianfeng Yong bought aggressively, and Mitsui bought American dollars for November at 375, raising the price to 4.4 yuan. Fuchang Xiang and Yifeng Yong Da De Cheng sold at a high price, falling to 3.7 yuan. Mitsui bought American dollars for December at 4375. Shunfa Yiyu, Hong Kang Yong Dafayong, Richang Yuanchang, Yongfu Xing Yong, Zhaofeng Chang Da Changxiang, and Heng Xing all bought aggressively, bringing the price back up to 4 yuan. Chinese merchants were excited to buy, and the domestic market tightened step by step. Yiyu Fu An, Yuan Yi, Yu Qing Yong, Richang Tongchun, and Sen Chang Yong bought again and again, raising the price to 9 yuan. The Dalian gang aggressively sold for a while, falling by 1 yuan. Yicheng Sen Chang Yong Hengtai still bought aggressively, raising the price to 9.8 yuan. Fuchang Fuxing, Yong Zheng Chang Yu Qing Yong, Shen Kang Shunfa Yong, and Da De Dafayong sold. Reuters reported that Shanghai would ship out 30,000,000 yuan of silver this month, falling back to 7 yuan. HSBC's quotations were announced, with English weakening by 125 and American by 25. Yuan Yi Daxing Yong took advantage of the low price to buy, rising to 7.5 yuan. But American dollars for October at 125 could be closed. Yuan Chun Ding Kang Yuan Sheng Yong Heng Yu sold, falling to 6.2 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong bought aggressively and stabilized, and Dachen Shunli Ding Kang Qian Chang Xiang Yuan Yi entered the market, rising to 8.9 yuan. Da De Cheng Wan Xing Heng Yu Tianfeng Huixiang sold, falling again to 6.6 yuan, but buying intentions were extremely strong. Major investors, such as Tongchun Fu An Yifeng Yong Yuanchang Yong Tianfeng Yong Yuanfeng Yong Dafayong, Yu Qing Yong Shen Kang, etc., bought relentlessly, breaking through the 60-yuan mark, rising to 62 yuan. Fuyu sold, falling back to 0.05 yuan for a while. Yongli Yuanfa Yong entered the market, rising to 2.9 yuan. Reuters said that the US Treasury Department announced new regulations for the management of silver, and that some silver certificates had left the Treasury Department. Fuyu Heng Yu Tianfeng Yuanfeng Yong sold to 1.5 yuan. The exchange market had tightened to within 35 yuan. Yuan Yi Yuan Heng Fuxing Yong Sen Chang Yong Yifeng Yong Qing Fayong, etc., bought aggressively again, rising to 65.5 yuan. HSBC offered American dollars for November at 34.9375 yuan. Tianfeng Heng Yu Fuxing Yong Fuchang Yuanfeng Yong Heng Xing sold to 3.4 yuan. Da Changxiang bought. The afternoon close was 963.8 yuan, and the spot price was 4.2 yuan. After the close, Da Changxiang Huixiang, etc., bought, but finally hovered within 4 yuan. The highest price for the half-day was 965.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 948.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 17.2 yuan. As a result, the close rose sharply by 14.9 yuan compared to the previous close. The closing price was calculated based on HSBC's American exchange rate, weakening by 125, to 34.875 yuan, with the price of bullion at 992 yuan, a premium of about 28 yuan based on the closing price, 11 yuan more than the previous close. The price for August was 970 yuan, for September 966 yuan, and for October 964 yuan. The afternoon price for premiums paid for spot gold was 970 yuan. The price of pure gold was 961.3 yuan, an increase of about 13 yuan. There were no large transactions in the market, mainly because the price of bullion had risen, and the Tianjin gang had no appetite. The "plus water" for Tianjin goods fell to around 15 yuan, and there were few formal transactions. Guest merchants had a slight selling appetite, but the spot market was only willing to offer a premium of 12 to 13 yuan. It was heard that a small amount of 99.3% purity was traded at a premium of 19 yuan. Forward contracts were discounted by Fuchang to Hengtai for 154 contracts, Yuan Chun for 140 contracts, and Da Changxiang for 105 contracts at 1 yuan. Fuchang discounted to Heng Yu for 28 contracts at 0.9 yuan, and Xiangfeng discounted to Fuxing Yong for 105 contracts, falling to 0.7 yuan. Mainly because the price of gold rose, the spot market was active. Only 238 contracts remained for this month, held by two longs: Shunli and Fuchang. The shorts were: Tongfeng Heng Qian Chang Xiang Da Shun Tong Yi Da Feng Heng Ding Chang. In the market, traders aggressively covered their short positions. In total, Yuan Mao Yong Chang, Yong Yiyu Bingxing, Futai Heng Ding Kang Hong, Shui Fu An, Fu Yu Yuan Xing, Da De Cheng Chang Sheng Yong, Da Xing Yong Da Changxiang, Hong Xing Tongchun, Shen Kang Chun Yuan Yong, Yongli Rui Kang Heng Xing Yuan Yuan, Yitong Tai Chang, Tianfeng Yong Richang, and Qing Fayong Yuanchang Yong were on the buying side.

But Chinese merchants, because of reports that the Ministry of Finance had invited experts to discuss stopping the export of silver, deeply worried that if it were implemented, their short exchange contracts would have no way to be covered. The market sentiment was very firm, and they bought immediately after the opening.

<h3>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow Still Considerable</h3>
<p>- Subsidiary Coin Market Sees Increase - Yesterday was another weekend. The Bund banks only did business for half a day in the morning. Due to time constraints, settlement was routinely postponed until Monday of the following week. As a result, most of the business could not be sorted out. In the market, silver dollar dismantling was 8 cents in the morning and afternoon, with a premium of 3 to 4 cents for transfers. Silver dismantling ticket transactions were over 3.1 million in the morning, with over 200,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon, transactions were over 300,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 200,000. Silver dollar mortgage transactions saw over 500,000 redeemed and over 600,000 newly made.

Foreign banks settled over 1.6-1.7 million in ticket payments, and settled 2.7-2.8 million in various commodity exchange mortgages and miscellaneous payments. 200,000 were released from warehouses. Chinese banks settled over 1.7-1.8 million in ticket payments, and settled 3.4-3.5 million in various exchange taxes and miscellaneous payments. 400,000 were deposited into warehouses.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Rumors Rampant, Continued Decline</h3>
<p>- Fell Another 2-3 Jiao to 1 Yuan 3 Jiao - Yesterday, the decline in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange intensified. The selling pressure was extremely strong. Although there was no adverse news, credit was tightening. Because the number of cash outflows was alarming, and the silver reserves in Shanghai were depleted, the silver dismantling rate might tend to rise. Arbitrage and delivery were significantly affected. Moreover, rumors were spreading out of thin air, causing panic. The decline was even more severe. In fact, although credit is tight, increasing the export tax should reduce outflows. Although there are many rumors, most are unfounded fabrications. Although the market price cannot be seen as good, a sharp drop is still premature. There is still room for recovery in the future. Yesterday's process began without continuing the previous day's closing uptrend. A slight weakness was immediately apparent. Although the August contract for compilation and disbandment was good by 0.25 yuan, the forward contract still weakened due to the isolated 0.4 yuan drop the day before. Market sentiment was immediately scattered. There was no shortage of organizations suppressing market prices, and the price would fall slightly after rising for many days, showing high pressure. Once all the small investors from various groups sold off, and the market price became small, there would be a turnaround. Therefore, after the decline in the compilation and disbandment contract, all subsequent contracts tended to decline. Later, more rumors spread, and the shorts fabricated facts, causing retail investors to become even more panicked. The decline intensified, gradually showing a state of terror. The market price continued to fall sharply, with some suddenly dropping by as much as 1 yuan. The resulting market prices fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan to 1.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was 19.99 million yuan. The resulting rise and fall are listed in the comparison table below.

<h3>New York Stock Market Increasingly Stagnant</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 17th), the New York stock market became increasingly sluggish. Speculators mostly lacked the motivation to trade and paid no attention to the market. The demand for fertilizer stocks was still good, because the area of cultivated land has decreased, but cultivation per acre has intensified, requiring a large amount of fertilizer, which directly increases the income of fertilizer companies. American Telephone and Telegraph fell based on a poor operating report for the first half of the year. Except for food stocks, no one is maintaining speculative stocks. Many bulls in the small exchange made profits and closed out positions, causing a large amount of public utility stocks to be sold off. In the bond market, because Duomini automatically reorganized its public bonds, South American public bonds all rebounded to high levels. The demand for U.S. government bonds is constant. Chicago corn fell due to continuous rain. Although the wheat harvest report was bullish, the price change was minimal. The total daily trading volume was 480,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Sixteenth Seventeenth Up/Down</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 91.69 91.12 Down 0.57</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 34.97 34.64 Down 0.33</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower Marked Yarn in Turmoil</h3>
<p>▲ Jardine Matheson Mill Opens 2,800 Bales of Five Blessings Shepherd</p>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose again, and the situation seemed slightly calmer. The general discussion in the market is that the bullishness of the Qianzhuang gang is extremely noteworthy. Their plan to take in at a limit price of 184.5 yuan this month has been broken by the sellers' offensive line. The morning low was seen at 182.5 yuan. The Qianzhuang gang, recognizing the poor atmosphere, did not resist, so the morning market was quite weak. Trading in spot yarn is still considered good, and the afternoon slightly rebounded, but the market is still flat.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Hovers</h3>
<p>The marked yarn opened in the morning, with American cotton down 20 points, and the previous day's closing situation was weak. The sellers' momentum was fierce. Although the Qianzhuang gang has a barrier of 4.5 yuan limit price this month, shorts were enthusiastic, and the first plate broke the limit price, falling sharply by 1.7 yuan from the previous day, with the lowest at 2.5 yuan. The forward period was also dragged down by more than one yuan. Although the decline was sharp, the bulls' intention remained calm, and the front line did not shake. The market atmosphere stabilized slightly after three closings, with shorts taking profits to cover positions. It is heard that spot yarn trading is still good, and each month rebounded by 5 or 6 jiao. As a result, each month fell 1, 2, 3, or 4 jiao, except for this month, which fell 1.3 yuan. The afternoon opening was weak and fell again. When auctioned to the second and third plates, the buying wind suddenly tightened, and the bulls slightly increased their positions. The closing rebounded by a small amount of 1 or 2 jiao. As a result, each month rose by 1 or 3 jiao. The total daily transaction statistics were 58,050 bales. It is found that 1,100 bales were sold by Wai Kong, 2,950 bales by Da Chang, 2,500 bales by Yi Chang, 4,300 bales by Shen Ji, 700 bales by Yuan Da, 800 bales by Ji Feng, 900 bales by Yuan Yi, 600 bales by Xie Sheng, and 600 bales by Jin Chang. 1,600 bales were bought by Chang Feng, 2,700 bales by Rui Da, 1,100 bales by Shen Chang, 1,250 bales by Sui Long, 800 bales by Da Ji, 650 bales by Geng Feng, 750 bales by Da Fu, 3,050 bales by Sen Kang, 3,250 bales by Heng Chang, and 600 bales by Yuan Tai.

<h3>Spot Sales Average</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still maintained. It is found that the total amount bought by various gangs throughout the day is 1,235 bales. Prices fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Jardine Matheson Mill opened 2,800 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd at a price of 186.5 yuan, including commission and taxes, for September delivery.</p>

<p>The cotton market has fallen for several days, so although the fall in American cotton was fierce, the local profit-takers took advantage of the weakness to cover their positions, so the market turned tighter. However, the spot cotton trading on the market is still flat. Various factories are gradually putting new cotton on the market, and the domestic harvest this year is satisfactory, so there is no urgent need to purchase. However, general scattered shorts are digging in enthusiastically, and each month has risen above the 5-yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Steadfast</h3>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning, following the fall in American and Indian cotton by 2 or 3 jiao, and the situation was weak again. The August term broke the 5-yuan mark, and the October term saw a new low of 34.55 yuan. When auctioned to the second plate, Da Fu covered a large number of short positions in the August term, with more than 3,000 dans, and the panic was completely dispelled, and it suddenly rose. The market stabilized, and buyers were even more enthusiastic. As a result, it only fell 5 fen to 1 jiao. The afternoon opening was tighter in the August term, and the market price slowly rose. Buyers were still enthusiastic at the close, so the rise was even sharper. As a result, each month rose by 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The total daily transaction statistics were 154,300 dans. It is found that 7,200 dans were sold by Da Feng, 6,800 dans by Yuan Da, 6,600 dans by Shen Ji, 3,700 dans by Ren Feng, 6,700 dans by Chang Feng, 1,600 dans by Rui Yuan, 1,300 dans by Yong Chang, 2,600 dans by Tong He, 1,500 dans by Xin Heng, 1,500 dans by De Ji, 1,700 dans by Yu Kang, 2,300 dans by Shen Chang, 1,500 dans by Jin Chang, 1,200 dans by Chang Ji, and 1,200 dans by Shen Yu. 11,600 dans were bought by Jun Chang, 3,000 dans by Rui Da, 3,600 dans by Tai Xing, 3,000 dans by Ji Feng, 4,200 dans by Da Fu, 4,900 dans by Tong Ji, 1,400 dans by Tong Xing, 4,600 dans by Xin Heng, 2,100 dans by Yuan Yi, 3,800 dans by Da Chang, 2,000 dans by Yuan Xing Chang, 4,100 dans by Chang He, and 1,300 dans by Xin Cheng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

Spot goods sent to the factory, Xin Tong Zhou Flower 40.60, Da Cheng Factory entered 1,100 bales for shipment to Changzhou in September and October this month.</p>
<h3>Only Six Days Remaining in the Market</h3>
<p>The standard yarn and flower for this month in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange are scheduled to be delivered on the 30th. The trading of yarn and flower for this month will be suspended on the 27th, 28th, and 29th. The market will be completely suspended on the delivery day. This has already been announced.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Falls by 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton fell due to poor news from Liverpool, sluggish cloth market, and selling in the South. The market was depressed. As a result, spot goods fell by 20 points, and futures fell by 18 to 21 points. British cotton futures fell by 17 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to poor news from Liverpool and a large number of bulls closing positions, but later slightly rebounded due to purchases by speculators and brokers. As a result, Ping Guo Er fell by 2.25 Robbie, Omula fell by 6.25 Robbie, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 4.75 Robbie. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 17th):</p>

<p>Large Grain Speculators Re-Emerge to Absorb</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Rise Again After Falling</h3>
<p>Flour Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of various months showed a consistent decline. With foreign wheat quoted, Chicago was good by 8 fen, and there were also declines of about 1 jiao to 3 jiao. Canadian wheat fell by 4 or 5 jiao, so after the opening price, the market atmosphere was weak. Near-term and forward-term bulls sold out in succession due to the poor environment, and some factories also sold out in line, so by the second plate, the near-term was down 2 or 3 fen from the previous day, and the forward-term was down 5 or 6 fen. The huge ups and downs show that the active power of speculation is indeed awe-inspiring. By the time the afternoon market opened, people's minds were initially calm, and then a strong rebound trend appeared. Extra-market speculation, due to the long-lasting clear weather and no rain, there are rumors of a ban on the sale of wheat in various places, and it is also rumored that silver will be taxed, and the future of prices will change. Therefore, large bulls absorbed again, and small factories in the interior also rose up to cover positions. After the second plate, the rebound was very rapid. As extra-market speculation resumed, it was rumored that the exchange's margin had been restored to its old appearance, and trading was more convenient, so the market fluctuated. As a result, this month was better by 1.5 fen than the previous day, September was better by 1 fen and 2.5 li, October was better by 1 fen, November was slightly better by 2.5 li, December was unchanged, and January was slightly better by 0.5 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, the prices of various months generally showed a flat and weak appearance. With foreign wheat quoted, although it rebounded by a small amount of 1 jiao to 3 or 4 jiao, the market's sentiment was very firm because the local traders' minds were very firm, and even a large amount of spot goods were in the hands of the traders. Customers' arrivals were mostly absorbed by traders, so although the price of foreign wheat was small, the entry and exit of the exchange was quiet. The market atmosphere was very stable at the beginning of the opening, but it also declined slightly due to the decline in the flour market, which was down by 3 or 5 fen compared to the previous day. By the time the afternoon market opened, it was initially seen hovering, with very little trading. Later, due to the rebound in the flour market, people's minds were also raised, and there were rumors in the market that capitalists would buy spot goods for future hoarding. This situation is a major obstacle to the future of people's food. Therefore, after the second plate, the rebound was also rapid. As a result, this month was better by 1 fen, September was better by 2 fen, October was better by 6 fen, November was better by 2 fen, and December was slightly better by 1 fen. The spot wheat market, because the factory's appetite is still good, and there are rumors of hoarding in the market, the high-priced goods are shouting high by nearly 1 jiao, and there is still a tight appearance. Kaiwaipu Suzhou, Linhuai, and Xuzhou wheat is 4 yuan, Gaoyou wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao, Yaowan wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen, Bao Ying wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen, and Liuhe Yangzhou wheat is 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 fen, totaling 26,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Xinpu Xinmao Mung Beans on the Market</h3>
<p>The Chongming new sand yellow announced the day before yesterday was actually falsely reported as old beans. The new beans must be delayed until after the Mid-Autumn Festival before they can be put on the market. Yesterday, there were 50 bags of Xinpu Xinmao mung beans on the market. This year's products are excellent, with uniform and clean seeds, but the cost must be outside of 4 yuan, so the price talks between buyers and sellers are still different, so the market has not opened. Yesterday's new and old yellow bean market atmosphere turned stable, because the Dalian market turned, and the bean cake market was tight again, and the way out was for hoarders to handle it, so the old bean market took the lead in improving. It is estimated that 2 cars of Zhengyangguan beans, 3 cars of Quanhe beans, 6 or 7 cars of Yingzhou beans, and 1 or 2 cars of Haozhou beans were opened. The market slightly rose by 1 or 2 fen, and the new bean was brought to stability, and sales increased sharply. It is estimated that 1,4500 bags of Chengmen beans, 1,000 bags of early yellow beans, and 6 or 700 bags of other beans were traded.</p>
<h3>Special Japonica Still Exceeds the Limit Price</h3>
<p>(Hunan) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were Numbers 11 and 12, (a total of 1,700 to 1,800 shi). The sales market was first stagnant and then moved. The Qingdao gang continued to handle imports, with more than 200 bags of special goods, so the sellers' shouts were quite high at the time. However, as a result of the long-term fatigue, it was not easy for people's minds to suddenly stabilize, so there was no brilliant color in the plates of various goods, and it was still a stable situation. Only Su Tong japonica relied on the shortage of goods to show a slightly fresh corner, and the others, such as early and late rice, had little ups and downs in price, and the situation was slightly hopeful. Du Yangjian followed without honor or disgrace, and only Bian Yuan was tired due to the narrow way out and the market color.</p>
<p>(Hubei) Yesterday, more than ten ships from various gangs in Hexia arrived. The stomach for various goods on the market, white japonica had slight transactions, and the price turned tighter. Early thin rice arrived and sold evenly, and the price was stable. Yangjian picked and chose slightly, and the price was tired by 1 or 2 jiao. Bai Yuan, Du Ke japonica, and Dong Xinjians price had little ups and downs, but the top special white japonica made an opening and still exceeded the limit price by 4 jiao. Sugar market</p>
<h3>Coarse Sand White Suddenly Rises with Customs Gold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly saw a tension in customs gold and standard gold. The rise in customs gold was nearly 4 fen, and the trend was greatly shaken. The association划盘ed 24 coarse sand white spot goods, calling for a rise of 6 jiao, but 19 yuan and 8 jiao was not achieved. This store's goods划盘ed 19 yuan and 8.5 jiao, a good rise of about a corner. Transshipment goods were 6 yuan and 4.5 jiao, a rise of 5 fen. Dutch red spot goods called 15 yuan and 4 jiao, and transshipment of 6 yuan was unchanged. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 20 yuan and 1 jiao, and the number 1 cotton white of this factory called 18 yuan and 8 jiao, but 7 jiao was still traded, but the quantity was not large and the situation turned tight. Chaoqing only opened dozens of bags of Huanggang Qing, the price was 13 yuan and 8 jiao, and the second was 6 jiao. According to Shantou telecommunications, the price has rebounded again, and the momentum is very firm. North-South goods</p>
<h3>Haikou Branches' Opening Prices Turn Loose</h3>
<p>More than 2,000 boxes of Haikou branches arrived before, but recently sales have been stagnant, and the industry is requesting a price reduction, but customers are not satisfied, so they have repeatedly failed to reach a deal. Yesterday, the opinions of both parties gradually approached, and the disk will be reopened in the afternoon. As usual, the previous disk was reduced by 0.1 yuan to several jiao, and the trend was average. Silk and tea</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Prices Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>▲ New York China Silk Inventory Not Weak New York raw silk market, China silk factory sales are not good, importers' inventory of Chinese yellow and white factory warp, as of the 15th of this month, totaled 3,837 bales, an increase of 714 bales compared to the same period last month.</p>
<p>▲ Long Spit Cocoon Silk Italian Sales Rebound The best silk heads such as long spit and cocoon silk from our country's silk factories have been selling well in Italy in the past. Recently, due to the impact of the dumping of rayon and Japanese silk layer (ie, silk heads), Italy's sales of silk heads in our country have almost stopped. Recently, it has suddenly become active. Since the last Italian mail ship, the Controvento, loaded more than 300 pieces of silk heads, Italian silk merchants' appetite for long spit and cocoon silk has not been silent, and the price has risen by 1 or 2 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Bank Silk Sales Difficult The exchange rate between Europe and the United States has continued to rise recently, and the telegramed price is clear and firm, but secretly tired. Silk merchants lose money and find it difficult to sell, and transactions are not smooth. Yesterday, only Da Chang and others supplemented the purchase of 30 bales of yellow and white factory, and the price was stable.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei European Sales Slightly Move</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Shanghai foreign bank tea market, Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi Lai Lu Zhuang, Ying Zhuang Jinlong Xiehe and other firms, reopened due to receiving foreign telegrams requesting them, but the stomach was not large, and the limit disk was still low. The city sold more than 600 boxes in total, and the selling price was 912 yuan, which was not much higher or lower than before. Wuyuan Beilu Gongse Zhenmei, the market is still sluggish, and even the earthen village's inferior goods are not asked about. Therefore, most tea factories dare not continue to purchase goods, and more than 30 factories have stopped work and rested, and the future is quite bleak.</p>

<p>Women's Corner</p>
<h3>On (Gaudi Dressing and Women)</h3>
<p>— Ivan</p>
<p>I saw Xuan Jun's (Gaudi Dressing and Women) in the August 12th issue of this journal. Of course, I will not object to raising such questions for discussion; however, the conclusion of Xuan Jun's article really needs to be discussed further.</p>
<p>Blaming women who dress gaudily for not doing some beneficial things for society in this era, but instead being busy dressing up enchantingly to tempt the opposite sex; I also feel that this blame is very right. Secondly, Xuan Jun attributes the motive and origin of women's gaudi dressing to the inferiority of women's society (because they are commodities, they have to be decorated to seek sales). I think this statement is partially correct. Later, he wrote the main part of the article, saying: (The fundamental solution is still to enable women to have equal and independent status, and do not have to exchange physical bodies for living materials. Under this principle, first, society should no longer have enslaved education, and second, women should be able to have a truly independent environment. One. This conclusion looks plausible at first glance, but after studying it again, it is impossible not to feel that such a theory is too empty; furthermore, it is too unforgiving of women's status.</p>
<p>Xuan Jun demands (society) not to have enslaved education again, and to enable women to have a truly independent environment. Who does this (society) represent? It's a bit vague. If what it represents is this old society with hundreds of holes and thousands of sores in front of us, no matter how much you shout at it, demand it, or shout loudly at it, it will not pay attention to you: because all the mistakes you point out are its meticulously crafted masterpieces, and as long as its own life can be extended for as long as possible, it will of course maintain these mistakes for as long as possible. If the target of these demands is the future new society, then we should think that that society has not yet been born, and we cannot shout in the air for it to do this or that, and we cannot simply shout out our demands to it. Because it is we ourselves who cause it to be produced, and it is also we ourselves who represent it. The only question is what kind of efforts we will use to realize our own demands.</p>
<p>Returning to the discussion of gaudily dressed women, in fact, only a very small number of urban women are truly worthy of being called gaudily dressed, and the vast majority of working women, although they are in the same inferior social status, are not doing (foreign slaves), and are not doing (foreign goods salesmen). Not only do they not have the desire to dress themselves up enchantingly, but even if they do, their time and energy do not allow them to do so. Urban women with dissolute lives do not work, and they have a lot of time, energy, and financial resources to squander at will; and the idle men who live with them are also implying or encouraging them to dress enchantingly and innovatively to suit that kind of debauched life, so in big cities, we can find so many gaudily dressed women who do not engage in production, and who maintain their lives by means of their enchanting physical bodies. (We do not need to distinguish between who is a prostitute and who is a respectable woman. In terms of social production and consumption, they are no different.)</p>
<p>If we feel that these women who specialize in gaudi dressing are embarrassing and are a loss to all of us, the fundamental solution is only through the efforts of all of us to eliminate the class in human beings that lives an exceptionally superior life, and to eliminate the parasitic class that only consumes and does not produce. This must be the case to be a (fundamental solution). Otherwise, we can just submit a petition to the government to stop women's gaudi dressing. Isn't that considered a passive method?</p>
<h3>Self-Criticism and Critical Awareness</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>Some people think that men also succumb to women, for example, saying: (Bow down under the pomegranate skirt), (Hold the whip for a beauty), and so on. But the person who said this must have myopia of more than a thousand degrees, and there is no way to explain it to him.</p>
<p>Women have never escaped the oppression of men. Even if they can get many men to kneel at her feet, or many men to beg to hold the whip for her, it is only for her eyes, small mouth, slender legs, … and not for anything else; they kneel in front of men in the same way, but for his power, greatness, and other things. So what is the point of women painting their eyes black, painting their lips red, and making their legs shiny, in order to win the bowing down of a crowd of men?</p>
<p>There are many unpromising actions of women: bizarre clothes and flamboyant clothes, dyeing their hands and feet, excessive decoration, romantic and frivolous is one end; not working hard in school, not being serious in doing things, and一心想漁獵 a rich and handsome man and marrying him, taking marriage as the only way out and the only career is another end; sticking to the old ways, being shallow and ignorant, taking boredom as truth, being stubborn and inflexible, and hindering evolution is one end; living together all day long, not speaking of righteousness, gossiping, not knowing what life, society, the nation, and the country are, and wasting a lifetime is one end; singing, dancing, gambling, wasting and being carefree, and not even hearing about household chores and childcare is another end; … All of these are today's knowledgeable women, painful phenomena of willingly degenerating into foxes, pigs, and dogs. If women want to escape from the inhuman realm, knowledgeable women should have a solemn self-criticism!</p>
<p>Furthermore, recently there has been a lot of (nagging) about women. We don’t have to talk about the distant German of the West; just look at our own country, treating women as an ominous enemy; prohibiting men and women from sharing a car, prohibiting men and women from eating together, prohibiting men and women from living together, prohibiting women from being barefoot and bare-legged, … If society could do entirely without them behind the scenes, it would simply be possible to turn them all into cannon fodder in order to correct people's hearts. At the same time, newspapers are touting: In the past few months of this year, tens of millions of脂粉香水 were imported, tens of millions of花邊 were imported, and tens of millions of real and fake jewelry were imported. It seems that these bewitching monsters who hurt customs and morals are the source of national economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>It is true that these foreign goods-dressing, hand- and foot-dyeing monsters are indeed a part of the source of hurt customs and morals and national economic bankruptcy. But among the imports of more than ten billion yuan, apart from the large amount of military supplies, have we ever touted that tens of millions of Panama hats were imported; tens of millions of Luzon cigars were imported; and tens of millions of Parisian斯特康 were imported? No! No one is publicizing these evils that were not created by women.</p>
<p>From now on, we (women) should really recognize what kind of year this is! How should we step-by-step guard against this year! External criticism may be by denigrating women's bizarre clothes and flamboyant clothes, romantic carefree, and then advocating that women should return to the family, return to being无才便是德, return to 内言不出于阃, and even not allow them to show their faces, and put black cloths on their faces, like the women in Islamic countries, living as蒙頭母猪.</p>
<p>Autumn is everywhere with an aura of肅殺, but the solid pine and cypress trees can still stand proudly unharmed; although the times are indeed a disaster for us, if we can properly restrain ourselves and progress properly, we may be able to have more strength to struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned, ignorant women cannot be hoped to raise their heads slightly for equality and freedom; the heavy burden of women's liberation rests on the shoulders of our few knowledgeable women. Are we going to let ourselves be so internally corrupted, plus the successive external pressures, and our own ends垂垂, and be willing to enter the pigpen and cowshed as livestock?</p>
<h3>The Problem of Further Education</h3>
<p>— Jun Ping</p>
<p>China is a notoriously illiterate country. According to general statistics, the number of illiterate people accounts for 80% to 90% of the population. If we only look at women, it's probably closer to 100%! In today's world, where the vast majority of women not only cannot afford to study, but also don't even have enough to eat, it seems somewhat trivial to discuss the issue of further education for a small minority of women. However, in terms of women's enlightenment, it is still a social problem worth discussing.</p>
<p>Our motivation for discussing this issue is not only to provide general young people with some knowledge that they must prepare during the further education period, but this is not enough. We need to further discuss the question of the understanding of further education by those seeking it. In other words, we not only discuss how to pursue further education, but also why we want to pursue it. Regarding the former, it has already been discussed in the previous essay by Ying Jun, so there is no need to repeat it. Here, we will only talk about the latter.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of why we want to pursue further education, I think that every woman preparing for further education must have a deep understanding of it! This understanding not only affects the choice of school and academic subject, but also affects the entire future of the person seeking further education. If one pursues further education without any understanding, simply for the sake of it, it is simply a blind walk, and the result will be hitting a wall. However, the understanding of further education is also the understanding of society, because social relationships have already determined the fact of further education and do not allow those seeking it to do whatever they want. Therefore, those seeking further education must first objectively understand the reality of social facts, and then determine their own purpose of pursuing further education.</p>
<p>In contemporary Chinese society, the purpose of further education for women is mostly to obtain higher knowledge and skills, so as to achieve economic independence and not rely on men. This is originally a manifestation of women's self-awareness. But the reality is not entirely like this. Since the May Fourth Movement, with the transformation of the entire social relationship, the number of women seeking education has been increasing. Until today, there are also quite a few women who have graduated from middle school and university, but how many of them can independently support themselves in society! Apart from a small number who become primary and secondary school teachers and other low-level employees, most of them become wives or concubines! Taking female teachers alone, in the era of male dominance, the status of male teachers is often superior to that of female teachers; the better positions are first taken by male teachers, and as a result, women can only serve in the lowest-level schools. As for the harshness of their treatment, it goes without saying. In any profession, it is simply impossible for women to compete with men. The reason for this is definitely not simply based on the low level of knowledge of women, but mainly because women are still in a subordinate position in society.</p>
<p>Especially at a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, cities are in panic, and the entire society is turbulent, let alone women cannot find a way out, even most men with bachelor's degrees are indeed trapped in unemployment panic. The so-called "Job-Seeking Alliance" in Peiping recently is an interesting example. Before the fundamental transformation of society, this phenomenon will not only not stop, but will intensify. This can be asserted! If the purpose of further education is only to obtain a better occupation, then these facts before you will give you a negative answer!</p>
<p>In such a situation, the lack of a way out for educated women is all too obvious. Therefore, their only way out is the commodification of themselves. In today's society where everything is commodified, the commodification of women is very common and not surprising. Men who sell their labor are also a kind of commodity! However, the commodification of educated women has its own special significance. They cannot sell their knowledge and skills in society, and they do not want to sell their labor like female workers. As a result, they can only further embellish themselves in the commodified self, in order to obtain a better buyer! In this way, applying rouge and powder, and wearing colorful clothes, of course, has the meaning of decorating the commodity, and studying and pursuing further education also has the meaning of decorating the commodity to increase its value! Who dares to say that a graduation certificate is not an advertisement to attract customers! Young women who are preparing for further education must have a deep understanding and criticism of this phenomenon, and further strive to correct the decadent tendency of being willing to degenerate!</p>
<p>In short, the lack of a way out for women, and even their willingness to degenerate, is more accurately attributed to social causes than to women's own incompetence. Therefore, the fundamental solution to the women's issue must wait until the solution to the entire new social issue. However, the self-awareness of each woman about her position, and the continuous struggle against the old forces, is also a necessary condition for the liberation of women. If modern Chinese educated women do not have this kind of self-awareness and determination to struggle, then even if they pursue further education and study abroad, and return with a doctorate, they will only be a few more active commodities that can consume more, and will be of no benefit to society!</p>
<h3>On the Prevention Between Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>(Restoring the past) If it is truly beneficial to human society, I don't think anyone will be (obsessed with the new). Recently, newspapers have been promoting the idea that the prevention between men and women is gradually becoming stricter again. This is probably due to the reaction of (people's hearts (especially women's hearts) not being ancient). Is being ancient necessarily good? That's not certain. The Three Hundred Songs of Poetry can be considered ancient books, but in the Book of Songs, there are many descriptions of love problems, such as: (...a girl is longing for spring, a fine man seduces her), (Slowly, slowly, don't excite me to touch the curtain, don't let the big dog bark!). I'm afraid that young people who are currently accepting (European and American winds and rains) and are (obsessed with the new) cannot do as well as that! It can be seen that love between men and women has existed since ancient times. People who are enthusiastic about (restoring the past) don't really know what (the past) means? Could it be that the society that produced the Book of Songs was already decadent at that time? Tracing further back, I'm afraid people (only knew their mothers and didn't know their fathers)! Sexual intercourse was chaotic and mixed! It can be seen that Confucius's sigh of (I have never seen anyone who loves virtue as much as they love sex) can also be called there is no way to deal with it. What Mencius said: (Knowing what is good, then admire young and beautiful women!) has been the case since ancient times. Gao Zi's statement that Mencius admitted: (Appetite for food and sex is human nature!) does have some truth.</p>
<p>Putting aside the Book of Songs, let's study folk songs:</p>
<p>(I'm seventeen or eighteen and want to steal, I don't care if my parents bind my feet? Wheat is on the field, grain is full, chives meet spring and are cut!), (Jiangyin) Liu Bannong's collection of Wafu.</p>
<p>(I can't sit still, I always miss my sister, I bought a piece of paper with three copper coins, and draw my sister's face to look at on the bed.), (Guangdong) Collection of folk love songs.</p>
<p>These folk songs exist all over the country, but they are mostly the same with minor differences. It is impossible to investigate when they were produced. It can be asserted that they did not have the influence of (European and American winds and rains) because the people who sang these songs were mostly village girls and cattle herding boys, or farmers and farm women. They had never studied foreign stereotypes (workers also sang them, but they brought them from the countryside). This shows that whether wise or foolish, virtuous or unworthy, (inevitably have feelings), and are not bewitched by foreign devils! And the so-called (prevention) is also a waste of effort. At most, it will only restore (same car), (same walk), (same table), etc., to (amazing), (jumping over the wall), (eyebrow language), (eye contact), so that men and women don't see each other, and once they see each other, they will blush and their hearts will beat wildly. If they have the opportunity, they will pounce like hungry tigers (really, how can this be!), there are countless things like this, past and present. Compared to what is now called (love), polite (meeting), (communication), and even (walking together), (same car), (same eating), (same sitting)... I ask, which is better?</p>
<p>In short: The mutual love between men and women is naturally like water flowing downwards. The only fundamental way is to guide them well and prevent them from going astray. If you only use prevention to treat it, isn't it like building a long dyke to control the Yellow River? After spending thousands of years of financial resources, it still breaks its banks from time to time?</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Ciyou Nursery</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>It was a terribly hot afternoon.</p>
<p>On Yangshupu Road, my whole body was soaked in sweat, asking east and west, and finally I found the place where the laborers entrusted their children – the Shanghai Ciyou Nursery.</p>
<p>The building had two stories, both upstairs and downstairs, facing the road.</p>
<p>Walking through the low door on the right was the classroom. A dozen low tables were neatly arranged, and the surrounding walls were sparsely decorated with a few paintings and statistical charts. Although the equipment cannot be said to be fully complete, it is enough to say (simple). At this time, two very amiable ladies appeared at the stairs. After I stated my purpose, they sincerely invited me and guided me upstairs.</p>
<p>The attic was used as staff dormitory and for children to wash their faces. Dozens of small towels and dozens of mouthwash cups were hung up with numbers on them. The front building was a simple children's paradise. The walls were covered with colorful illustrations, and the cabinets were filled with many children's gifts. Lively and lovely children all greeted me with smiles, calling (teacher). This scene was really hard to bear afterwards, because it reminded me of my own lost childhood.</p>
<p>After a brief greeting, I sat down and opened the topic I had brought in advance to a Ms. Wang. The following is a conversation between the reporter and Ms. Wang, the nanny at the nursery.</p>
<p>(Please tell me about the general situation of your nursery, Ms. Wang.)</p>
<p>(Our nursery is sponsored by the China Ciyou Association, and it has been three years now. The monthly expenses are 300 yuan, and the building is provided by the Hudong Commune next door, without any cost. As for the administrative organization, it is also very simple. In addition to a director, there are only two teachers, Miss He and I. There are currently a total of fifty children admitted. The youngest is three years old and the oldest is seven years old, with an average age of four or five years old.)</p>
<p>(How much does it cost per person per month?)</p>
<p>(Because we are originally somewhat charitable, the fee is very cheap, five jiao a month, and we also have to provide them with a lunch and snacks! However, if they are children of businessmen, they cannot enjoy this right. According to regulations, they have to pay five yuan.)</p>
<p>(What occupations do the families of the current children have the most?)</p>
<p>(They are all workers from egg factories and yarn factories. Because we have to conduct detailed investigations when each child enters, they cannot deceive us.)</p>
<p>(What time is your nursery open, and are there any holidays?) I asked again.</p>
<p>(The opening hours are from 7:00 am to 5:00 or 6:00 pm. Sunday is a rest day. There is no summer vacation, and winter vacation depends on whether the workers rest or not. Roughly, there are two weeks off each year.)</p>
<p>(What about childcare?)</p>
<p>(We divide all the children in the nursery into two levels. In the morning, they all take knowledge classes downstairs. After a nap at half past twelve, they change to this place or the playground of the Hudong Commune next door for game lessons.)</p>
<p>(What about hygiene?)</p>
<p>(In terms of hygiene, due to limited financial resources, the equipment is very simple. Usually, in addition to the daily routine work, such as washing faces and gargling, we stipulate that the children take a bath once on Mondays and Thursdays.)</p>
<p>(Aren't you two too tired?) I said this. Ms. Wang and Ms. He, who was busy taking care of the children, both smiled.</p>
<p>(Last time in Shen Bao, someone advocated that in the current era of China, there is no need for nurseries and public childcare. What do you two ladies think of this opinion?)</p>
<p>(Ah! These theories are too profound, how can we understand them?) They both answered in unison. But then, Ms. Wang said, (However, in my opinion, facts are the greatest eloquence, Mr. ×, come and take a look!) So, I stood up and walked to a child's side. The child was probably only four years old.</p>
<p>(This child is very pitiful. His father and mother, like other children, are workers and have to go to work in the factory early in the morning. Who will take care of him? Look! This is what the tram crushed! Ms. Wang said to this place and gently pulled the child's hair! Pull it! There, a half-foot long scar, the purple blood clots are still congealed, (ten days ago!) Ms. Wang continued (His parents found out that there was a nursery here, so they sent him here. If there were nurseries set up everywhere in Shanghai, how could the children suffer these disasters innocently?)</p>
<p>I was fortunate that this innocently injured child was admitted to a happy paradise, and I prayed for the countless pitiful children in China, with the establishment of a complete nursery as soon as possible. This is not only the task of charitable organizations, and I hope that people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings will advocate and sponsor it more.</p>
<h3>Letter (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>What's more, there are those who appear to be golden bodhisattvas, but whose mouths reek of opium smoke, with a dry and withered face of a frightening leaden hue, and weary, lifeless eyes. Their shoulders are hunched up like skeletons, and they can't straighten their backs. They can barely breathe, half coughing, half panting. What kind of vicious influence do these ghostly spirits have on the national economy, and on the poisonous legacy they leave to their offspring? Have you ever thought of shouting at them: (Ghosts, hurry up and hide in your graves! Otherwise, we will carry out a barrage of gunfire!)?</p>
<p>On the contrary, working women toil all year round without enough food or clothing, or they weaken drastically and age quickly due to excessive labor, or they fall ill and die due to postpartum imbalances and the whip of work; or they accidentally injure their bodies, lose their hands, lose their jobs, and fall into a bleak and boundless life... You seem afraid to look directly at their miserable lives; you also seem to have never looked directly at the ghastly, painful, and hungry lives of a bunch of dregs-like poor women, living lives worse than slaves, worse than stray dogs; you have you ever thought about how to awaken and liberate the ignorant and stubborn women in the interior who are still living under hellish oppression?</p>
<p>These two extremes of all kinds of bizarre phenomena; on the one hand, they manifest the imbalance of the semi-colonial economy, the low status of women, and the high degree of depravity of urban women; on the other hand, they manifest the ignorant women under the heavy oppression of the semi-colonial, struggling and panting like cattle and horses.</p>
<p>The deeper and further these grotesque phenomena evolve, the more China will only perish and become extinct. If it doesn't perish and become extinct, then that would be a disgrace!</p>
<p>Why have Chinese women fallen into such a depraved and miserable state? Where is the cause?</p>
<p>We do not … That reason is social, economic, institutional, political, or that women willingly degenerate. In short, we are the pain suffered by the people of the semi-colony, which is worse than that of the slaves of the subjugated country. We awakened women, especially you, who hold the authority of women's voices, what do you think of this sharp grotesque phenomenon? Can you sit idly by as this sharp, vicious, miserable thing deepens and evolves?</p>
<p>Shouldn't we find out the cause and effect of it and discuss it with powerful criticism? Shouldn't we throw a spark of light towards the heavy curtain of oppression, let the bad die out, and let the good grow? Shouldn't we use our women's bare hands, unite our efforts, and urgently rescue the thousands upon thousands of oppressed and sinking women, so that they can be thoroughly liberated?</p>
<p>If so, then what you wanted to say, you have not said!</p>
<p>You have not deeply reflected the sharp grotesque phenomena, and targeted the abyss of poison with sweeping fire; you have also rarely used the brightness of magnesium light to lead out the women who have fallen into the abyss and teach them to fly to the sky of true freedom.</p>
<p>Indeed, you have worked very hard, you constantly attack the dissatisfaction of the past, and there are many places where you seek welfare for the women of the present. But you have paid too little attention to the current sharp grotesque phenomena, bad habits, and those who call for women to return to the family.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is (Women should return to the family!) In this day and age, you can only say those things? But we are about to thoroughly resist the evil slogan (Women should return to the family!) and fight to the death! Should we all work hard to oppose this slogan and not surrender?</p>
<p>We must not only oppose (Women should return to the family!), we must also sing loudly: (Women should go deep into society!) We must not only run out of the family and break free from the iron chains of the present, we must also bravely fight for the political and economic status to be equal to men, and do everything the same as men! We must not only wash away the sharp bad habits of women and firmly seek the liberation and freedom of women, we must also use our emotions, blood, and love to wash away all the sins of men, and work together to seek the liberation and freedom of the nation!</p>
<p>Since the sound of the September 18th Incident exposed Japan's intention to destroy China, the rights of Japanese women have risen by leaps and bounds, and the increase in occupations has led to women practicing military affairs and driving airplanes. And China, which is to be destroyed, wants women to return to the family. Recently, various southern agencies have implemented the practice of cutting off female employees and banning co-education, co-touring, and co-walking between men and women... making the women's rights that have been going backwards in recent years sink even further into hell! That kind of view of oppressing women is truly incomprehensible to those who care about the survival of the nation!</p>
<p>If women do not obtain thorough liberation and freedom, society will not progress! For a China that does not progress, and wants to breathe and survive under the enemy's strength, while singing: (Women should return to the family!), that is simply the raving of a feverish person with a terminal illness!</p>
<p>Arise, oppressed sisters! We are no longer listening to the instructions of the devil, no longer surrendering to the confused and chaotic men! We can no longer rely on the delicate beauty and charm of relying on others for a living, and give up the fight for our own economic independence! We are no longer specializing in decoration, making soulless golden bodhisattvas, and living by selling our bodies and destroying people! We cannot remain unaware of being exploited and squeezed in this society of economic panic and declining industries.</p>
<p>We must seek survival in resolute hard struggle, and we must know what a shame it is to depend on men for a living; we must strive for victory under the banner of freedom and liberation, step into the depths of society, extend to the borders of the country, and extend to the world! On the one hand, we must resolutely liberate ourselves from the past customs, systems, and the hands of men, and on the other hand, we must enthusiastically rescue the sinful and weak men of our peers and the next generation. So that everyone can break away from oppression and enjoy freedom!</p>
<p>We must use our own high-priced emotions, blood, and love to irrigate the flowers of freedom! We must do our best to do it!</p>
<p>Zi Jiu, don't think I'm talking nonsense and going crazy? Don't you think that the small space of the women's garden can't accommodate many opinions and can't speak as much as possible? My intention is -- I hope that in addition to reforming the women's garden, you will also fight for more space for women, so that ladies and gentlemen who are enthusiastic about liberating women can express their opinions as much as possible. I hope you will also negotiate with people who are concerned about this issue to create a women's publication with a larger scale, and wave the banner of women's liberation, and be energetic! Make the women's world in China, all under the banner of concentrated efforts, to get liberation, freedom … I wish you peace!</p>

<h3>The Austrian Problem</h3>
<p>— Lin Zi</p>
<p>Although Austria after the war is only a small country with a population of about six million, it occupies a very important position in Europe. All important measures of the Vienna government and many events that occur in this metropolis are not only directly related to the conflicts of interest of powers such as France, Germany, and Italy in Central Europe, but also have a great impact on the peace of the entire Europe and even the world. The so-called Austrian problem is actually one of the most complex, serious, and difficult-to-solve problems that have arisen after the war.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the fundamental contradictions between Germany, France, and Italy on the Austrian issue.</p>
<p>In Austria's foreign trade, Germany ranks first; at the same time, Italy's foreign trade towards the Danube countries also accounts for 10 percent of the total. Economically, Austria also has a great relationship with it; as for France, its finances have a great pressure on Austria. According to German newspapers, from 1919 to 1932, France lent Austria money (only referring to national loans) as much as 326 million francs, not including short-term credit loans. - From this, it can be imagined how much economic conflict would occur among France, Germany, and Italy in a small Austria.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to contend for hegemony in Central Europe, question the Balkans, and advance to the southeast, Germany had to work hard on the activities of German-Austrian unification. However, the Balkan Peninsula is regarded as France's private property, and Austria is also within its scope of aggression. France certainly cannot sit idly by while Germany is active. Therefore, in resolving the Austrian problem, Paris proposed the establishment of a Danube Federation including Austria and the Little Entente countries. Its intention was not only to cut off Germany's eastward advance, but also to block Italy in the Adriatic Sea, in order to dominate Central Europe. What about Italy? Of course, it is also very smart. It not only opposes France's desire to establish a Danube Federation, but also expresses great displeasure with the German-Austrian merger (although Italy and Germany are consistent in opposing the Versailles system) because once the German-Austrian merger is realized, it will also block Italy's way out. As for its solution to the problem, it is to try to realize the Austrian-Hungarian Federation, so as to disintegrate France's satellite Little Entente countries, cut off the danger of German-Austrian merger, and make the Danube completely controlled by Rome. Needless to say, this is absolutely opposed by Germany, France, and the Little Entente countries. Thus, on the Austrian issue, such a contradictory situation has been formed: France and Italy oppose Germany, Germany and Italy oppose France, and France and Germany oppose Italy.</p>
<p>The recent assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, nicknamed Little Napoleon, was undoubtedly caused by Hitler's eagerness to realize the policy of German-Austrian unification. However, after the incident broke out, Italy immediately mobilized nearly 100,000 troops and deployed them on the Austro-Italian border, declaring (Anyone who dares to interfere in Austria's internal affairs will be met with military force!). At the same time, Yugoslavia also immediately went on alert, Germany also closed the German-Austrian border, and Britain and France each had their own plans, only expressing their opinions on resolving the issue diplomatically, and the general public opinion circles shouted even louder: (The European powder keg has moved from the Balkans to Vienna!) For a time, war clouds were densely covered, and a cruel war was about to come. But what is this for? The Austrian problem!</p>
<p>Now, although Hitler has tried his best to defend himself, saying that the Austrian coup has nothing to do with Germany due to the unfavorable situation, and dissolved the Austrian Social Democratic Assault Team to ease the anti-German atmosphere, his forgetting about the planning of the German-Austrian merger is well known to the world. In his conversation with British newspaper reporters, hasn't he already openly stated the legitimacy of the German-Austrian merger? As for German Deputy Chancellor Papen's visit to Austria and the continued activities of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, it is enough to prove that the Berlin government is advancing on the road to the German-Austrian merger. Of course, Italy and France will not ignore this. Recently, Austrian Deputy Chancellor Starhemberg's visit to Rome, the brewing of the Austrian restoration movement, and the unusual close relationship between Rome and Vienna are all manifestations of Italy's active efforts to take Austria. France saw the sudden intensification of the German-Italian conflict and wanted to reap the benefits of the fisherman, so it deliberately pretended to be calm and did not issue specific remarks; even when news of the Austrian restoration movement came, Paris also showed its approval. However, Mussolini also understood that things were not so simple, and instead showed indifference to the Austrian restoration movement, saying (The Habsburg restoration problem is not as important as Austria's independence). With such intrigue and infighting, whether it is Germany, France, or Italy, they are all actively preparing for how to meet the new events in Vienna.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>How will the Austrian problem be resolved in the future? Will the German-Austrian merger be realized? The Austrian-Hungarian Federation? The Danube Federation? Or will something else be produced? Judging from the fundamental contradictions between France, Germany, and Italy on the issue, and judging from the past and present events, I am afraid that a concrete answer to the problem can only be found after the Vienna powder keg explodes. However, everyone knows that the danger of this powder keg exploding is likely to happen at any time. Not to mention that France, Germany, and Italy are preparing to ignite the fuse of this powder keg, even the British Empire, which has no direct relationship with the issue, has revealed its intention to participate in the war. Chamberlain's statement (The British defense line should be moved to the Rhine River) is a clear example.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Playwriting</h3>
<p>— Jianxin</p>
<p>Playwrights operate in three areas: the drama world, the broadcasting world, and the film world. Playwrights in the drama world are probably the most frustrated, as their productions rarely have the opportunity to be sold. Magazine editors often ruthlessly reject their painstakingly constructed works, turning their hard work into nothing. Rather than trying to make a living by writing plays, they might as well honestly throw themselves into the Huangpu River or the Yangtze River like Wei Yan, Zan Zhu Xiang. Playwrights of broadcast scripts... inevitably adapt some feudal, obscene old novels and Mandarin Duck Butterfly School works into broadcast scripts. As a result of their efforts to cater to the audience's low-level tastes, the remuneration they can get is only a few yuan per day if calculated by the day, and only about five jiao per thousand words if calculated by the word. Only playwrights in the film industry are relatively lucky, and only they can use their writing skills to exchange for bread. They are formal or semi-formal professionals, and they are the only people I want to talk about in this short article.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk about the group of people who are formally employed by film companies. Being a screenwriter in a film company may be thought to be a great job by those who don't know the inside story. Everyone has a misunderstanding that film scripts are certainly written by screenwriters, believing that he is the one who gives life to the entire film - just the fact that this kind of creative power can be fully realized, they think, is enough to make the person involved feel happy and satisfied. But in fact, their lives are not as beautiful as others imagine. Now, let's start with the treatment they receive. I would like to give an example. A certain company used to employ a basic screenwriter with a monthly salary of only 25 yuan. Last year, a new company that had shot two films, the screenwriter was still only able to reluctantly receive 40 yuan a month from the boss because of friendship; the monthly salary of a screenwriter director of a certain new company in this city was only 50 yuan. In large companies, if they get the introduction of powerful people or the appreciation of the boss, a screenwriter's monthly salary will generally not be less than 60 to 80 yuan. In the past, an unemployed friend, in order to find a source of livelihood, asked a friend who worked in a certain company to introduce a film script; the boss was very satisfied at first sight, not only bought the script for 100 yuan, but also, under the slogan of (promoting new talents)(?), paid 60 yuan a month and asked that friend to come to the company to handle the writing of the script. Also, an acquaintance got the introduction of a powerful person, and in exchange for a monthly salary of 80 yuan, he worked hard to help the boss of a certain company conceive stories, write dialogue subtitles, etc. There are also some well-known people with appeal or special connections, as well as some established screenwriters who have already achieved results, and film companies are mostly willing to pay more to hire these people, firstly because their names can be sold for money, and secondly because their works can sell well.</p>
<p>These professional screenwriters inevitably encounter some difficulties in their duties; these difficulties are not the technical problems of writing the script itself, but the problems of creative freedom when writing. The power to decide whether a script is suitable or not is in the hands of the big boss, the big director, and even the big stars, and the opinions that the screenwriter can participate in are minimal. The process of writing a script is roughly like this: first there is a short story or film novel - these are not necessarily conceived by the screenwriter - according to this story or novel, the company convenes a script discussion meeting; the big boss, the big director, and even the big stars can exert their authority in this discussion meeting; only their opinions are valuable and can be respected; a screenwriter, even if he is very proud of his own views, will inevitably be (insignificant), his opinions are inevitably going to be rejected and cannot be created alone, he must carefully solicit the director's opinions; he even only writes a more detailed scene-by-scene story, and leaves the detailed shots to the director himself to write. Also, screenwriters and bosses and directors often have different opinions; although the joint discussions of script discussion meetings, review meetings, or design committees organized by various companies, or the talks of related parties, can resolve these opinions to some extent, generally speaking, screenwriters mostly have to respect the opinions of the boss and the director and abandon their own opinions. So it is difficult for them to say that they are creators - of course, there are a few exceptions - sometimes they are even just the boss's or the director's echo, a puppet. When this happens, the screenwriter's job is easy, you only need to write a few characters, a few scenes, a few lines of dialogue, a few subtitles, and the screenwriter's ability is exhausted. But what's the point of doing this kind of mechanical work that buries oneself?</p>
<p>The various situations described above are particularly evident in certain companies. It is difficult for truly self-respecting people to endure another minute in such a dictatorial and despised atmosphere. They can hardly do it for long, at most a year and a half, at least three or two months, and they have to pack up and (leave). However, there are also some smart people who say east when the boss says east, and say west when the boss says west, so they can be very much reused, and it goes without saying that these people will be promoted and get a raise.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I would like to talk about the lives of those screenwriters who are not employed by film companies but often supply scripts to film companies. They may propose production plans to the company in the capacity of a film company consultant - such as (film production) plans - they do not necessarily have to go to the company to work, but they receive a reward of 50 to 60 yuan a month from the company. If the film scripts they create are adopted by a certain company - the possibility of adoption is high - each script can generally give them a maximum income of 300 yuan or a minimum of 200 yuan. Most of these people have a deeper understanding and cultivation in the fields of literature, drama, and film, and their being consultants or writing scripts is not a specialized profession, although their purpose is also to strive for the development of new Chinese films.</p>
<p>Writing this makes me have to think of some unknown writers wasting their efforts writing film scripts. If they can get the introduction of an employee or a powerful person of a certain company, their scripts may be lucky enough to be adopted; but the most remuneration is difficult to exceed 100 yuan. It has also happened that a certain company took out 50 yuan or even 20 to 30 yuan to buy a script. They are still considered polite to do so, because when they get this kind of thing, they must change it beyond recognition, and even change it completely beyond its original appearance. They can even say that this is their own creation, and refuse to pay you a penny. I have heard many people talk about this kind of exploitative behavior of stealing writers' stories.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to give some advice to some writers who are trying to make a living by writing film scripts; I would like to advise them to have less extravagant hopes for the film company's acceptance of external scripts, because unless there are acquaintances to introduce them, the crystallization of their hard work has little chance of being adopted and accepted. Especially today, when big directors are popular with the trend of (writing and directing their own), your chances are naturally even less. You think you can get some script fees from the big director, which can't be said to be a great delusion. Recently, a large company posted a very small notice soliciting film scripts next to the huge advertisement for the opening of a new film; I guess there must be no lack of applicants; but I dare say that their hopes will never be great. If it is for learning the technique of film script writing, then writing is naturally the more the better; but if you put aside other things in the midst of busyness and hope to exchange money by writing film scripts, then I think it is better to save your energy. Although there have been some film script writers in the past who were occasionally hired to be screenwriters because they submitted a script, this kind of thing is now very rare; by now, this kind of thing is probably difficult to see.</p>

<h3>Drought, Drought, Drought, Drought</h3>
<p>— Kuiwen</p>
<p>Shixia Correspondence</p>
<p>Shixia is a very high place, so floods are relatively rare, but drought - no, as long as it doesn't rain for more than ten days, this place becomes (barren land). Needless to say, this year's disaster is already doomed. Since the beginning of summer, there has not been a single drop of water, and disaster is playing on the heartstrings of everyone in the countryside, playing, playing.</p>
<p>The rivers in the four villages dried up a month ago, cracking into turtle patterns; the rice seedlings crystallized from the farmers' hard work withered like dead snakes.</p>
<p>The current Shixia countryside is full of desolate scenes. There, the farmers have nothing to do all day long, just staring blankly at the tender green rice seedlings turning yellow day by day, and the moist fields turning into gray sand; their hearts are also withering day by day.</p>
<p>However, although there is no work, eating is still needed every day; in the four villages invaded by the famine, food has become a problem again. At present, the general farmers' food is only relying on limited wheat: most of them smash the wheat and mix it with water, and eat a bowl and a half to fill their stomachs. In previous years, when food was scarce, there were still things like pumpkins and taro that could be used as substitutes; this year, even the good fortune of eating this kind of thing has gone with the drought! At this time, even if you walk all over the four villages, it is probably more difficult than ascending to the sky to see a dou of rice or a yuan of cash. The lack of food in the countryside and the total collapse of the economy are clearly revealing all the outlines here.</p>
<p>Although Shixia's transportation can be reached by train, it is not very convenient after all; they still rely on waterways, because transportation by waterway can avoid the trouble of carrying. Now that the bottom of the river is completely dry, the water transportation has therefore been cut off; three or four thousand boatmen and porters who rely on river water for their livelihoods have felt the pain of unemployment. Water is not usually thought of as a precious thing; however, in the drought of several months without rain, water has become a more serious problem than general problems. Needless to say, the fields need a lot of water for irrigation, and even the extremely small amount of drinking water is still inseparable from it for a moment!</p>
<p>Therefore, in the eyes of farmers, water seems to be more precious than gold. Usually, if they are not extremely thirsty, they are reluctant to scoop a bowl of water to drink. Sometimes, even if relatives and friends come, they don't even think of getting a drink. In such hot weather, they don't pay attention to bathing and washing clothes because of the water problem. This situation is not because of their meanness, nor is it because of their laziness, it is indeed because there is no source of water, which makes them intuitively feel that the importance of water is inseparably linked to their own lives.</p>
<p>In addition to the water problem, there is also the salt problem, which is no less serious than the water problem; although this salt problem is not as fatal as water, it is still a great threat to health.</p>
<p>Shixia's salt has always been transported by water, but after the bottom of the river dried up and the water transportation was naturally cut off, there was only one way to hire manpower to transport it. However, although the general oil and salt shops are willing to spend ten jiao per load, few people are willing to risk their lives to do the work of enduring the heat. Judging from the existing amount of salt in stock, the panic of light food is probably imminent!</p>
<p>Some shops in the town, due to the lack of sources of goods and the lack of purchasing customers, have gone bankrupt, accounting for more than two-thirds of the entire town. At the same time, what is also worth lamenting is that the incidents of selling children and daughters are almost every day; this kind of tragedy in the world is certainly not something that people can sympathize with, but on the contrary, they are still finding this last way to survive in the midst of helplessness!</p>
<p>Shixia is now all over, and the prosperity of the past has disappeared like a dream without leaving a trace. The past silk production, which was extremely abundant, has now plummeted. In recent years, the cholera-like economic decline in the world has quickly spread to the Shixia countryside; fresh cocoons, which used to be worth 70 yuan a load, later fell to 30 yuan. However, the tide of economic decline is getting fiercer and fiercer; this year, each load of fresh cocoons is only worth 17 or 18 yuan, and the cocoon merchants still complain that this price is too high.</p>
<p>According to the general old people, there was only one disaster like this in the sixth year of Xianfeng; but it was not as (barren land) as it is now!</p>
<p>Now the local authorities seem to have been awakened by the fierce disaster, so they are suddenly in a hurry like (hugging Buddha's feet at the last minute). The first step of their relief method is to call on farmers to open up the river channel; each village has only 30 yuan of relief funds, which are distributed by the township office to work, which is the so-called (relief through work). At the beginning, each farmer worked for a day and got half a sheng of white rice; this method was implemented for only a few days, and then it was changed to ten copper coins per day, and recently it has been reduced to only six copper coins per day. In this (rice is as precious as pearls, firewood is as expensive as cassia) social environment, are these six copper coins enough to buy chaff? But farmers have to work hard with empty stomachs for their own interests!</p>

<h3>Overview of China's International Trade</h3>
<p>— Huang Yuzhen</p>
<p>International trade is the act of promoting the sale of goods that are advantageous to produce in one's own country to foreign countries, so as to enable the people of one country and the people of other countries to mutually increase their welfare and expand the market and trade. China is originally a vast land with abundant resources, and most of the daily necessities can be self-sufficient. Moreover, domestic industry is underdeveloped, and there is no need to seek overseas trade for surplus products. However, since various countries are bringing their goods to trade with China, we must also think of a way to deal with them in order to offset the export difference with our goods. Some people say that China's foreign trade is completely passive, which is indeed somewhat true. Now, due to space limitations, I cannot talk more about other principles, and will only briefly discuss the current situation of foreign trade:</p>
<p>In terms of China's international trade statistics over the years, it has been a trade deficit since the third year of Tongzhi until now (except for five or six years). Although the total amount of trade is increasing year by year, the increase in imports is always far greater. In the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu, the total amount of trade in our country was more than 460 million taels, an increase of about four times compared with the third year of Tongzhi. Recently, the value of imported goods has always been around 1 billion taels, and the value of exported goods is only 700 to 800 million taels, totaling more than 1.8 billion taels. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, imports were 119 million taels, and exports were 99.1 million taels. Last year, the total import trade in the country was more than 195 million taels, a decrease of 19 percent compared with the previous year (the twenty-first year). The total number of imports was more than 800 million taels, a decrease of 18 percent compared with the previous year. The total number of exports was more than 310 million taels, a decrease of 20 percent compared with the previous year. In the first half of this year, the total number of imports in the country's foreign trade was 569,849,836 yuan, a decrease of 201,258,249 yuan compared with the imports of 771,108,085 yuan in the same period last year. The total number of exports was 326,854,4714 yuan, a decrease of 27,921,805 yuan compared with 329,646,6519 yuan in the same period last year. The total trade deficit was 301,305,122 yuan. There are three reasons for the decrease:</p>
<p>(1) Weak purchasing power: This is because the economic panic has spread to the world, resulting in too many unemployed people. The income of most people, that is, the business within a country, is very difficult to maintain the status quo.</p>
