<p>我國駐意公使劉文島氏最近由行政院及中政會先後通過升爲駐意大使且聞國府明令日内卽可公布在今日駐外使節中榮膺大使頭銜者除顔惠慶氏外惟有劉氏一人其責至重其位至隆深望劉氏能仰體政府付託之重國民期望之殷兢努力以求中意間種種懸案之解决也</p>
<p>吾人固表欣幸於兩國使節之升格然細察中意之間尙多遷延未决之懸案則仍不無有美中不足之遺憾今後將如何而謀改正彌補之道自以劉氏之負責爲獨重然亦意政府當局之所應好意玉成者也</p>
<p>吾人敢就劉氏出任大使之前夕陳述中意間之重要懸案右干事以爲之勗並爲意當局告所謂縣案者何曰</p>
<p>（一）則爲領判權交涉之延宕　意國正式享有在華領判權實濫觴於同治五年（一八六六）之北京條約是約業於民國十七年六月卅日滿期同年十一月二十七日兩國友好通商新約成立新約第二條規定此締約國人民在彼締約國領土内應受彼締約國法津及法院管轄惟另在換文中指明非俟九國公約簽字國（中國除外）全體承認取消領判權時意國仍不允取消此特權九國條約簽字國中之葡比二國關於此一問題與我已各有所商定至於荷蘭之對華政策則隨各大國而轉移然則中意新約第二條之實質的意義不過謂意大利在華領判權之撤銷與否惟英美法日四國之馬首是瞻而已夫意固大國何必以此自縛而减其聲價且據歷年統計意僑在華不過六七百人卽其經濟利益亦遠在英美法日四國之下更何必視此背乎國際常道之領判權若奇貨而徒爲他人作工具不觀乎德奥等國人民今日雖無領判權之庇護而仍得安居樂業其與華人間之感情且蒸蒸而日上則在親善爲懷之意國更何樂而不爲</p>
<p>（二）則爲天津意租界之存在　天津本有八國租界意租界僅其一耳然其間德奥俄比四界皆經我國先後收回所存者不過英法日意四界而已意租界成立最後面積最小（不過七七一畝）居民闻寡（不過七八千人其中外僑不過五六百人）意人何必留戀於此彈丸之地而令俄比二國專美於前且租界主權本屬中國遲早總須歸還原主曷不乘此使節升格聲中卽開交還談判</p>
<p>（三）則爲意軍艦停泊遊弋權及軍隊駐屯權之保持　意國軍艦停泊中國之領水實以同治五年北京條約第五十二欵爲根據該約旣廢則依照多年之慣例而繼續享受此點合法與否頗成疑問至於意國軍隊駐屯權本根據於辛丑和約然其常駐人數不過數十人遠不若英法日美四國之多夫和約之允許各國有駐兵權者無非因有拳亂之奇變「以保京師至海通道無斷絶之虞」耳今日我國朝野旣絶無盲目排外之思想就師且早經遷移至於水陸交通之南京則依據情理各國之於華北已根本無駐兵之需要面而况意國駐兵人數寥寥更爲聊應故事之舉耶此事影響於中國之國格者甚大深願早日糾正之也</p>
<p>（四）則爲意使館遷京之未實現　意政府旣視中國爲大國而提高其使館之等級自當設其使館於中國之首都以貫澈其表示好意之初衷今其駐華使館已在上海設有辦事處以期遇事有就近接洽之便利何不更進一步而撤廢在平舊館逕設新大使館於南京北平東交民巷之使館區早爲一畸形發展之贅瘤首都旣經南遷固有及早廢除之必要也</p>
<p>（五）則爲中意通商航海條約之待訂　據十七所中意新約第三條兩締約國約定於最短期内議訂一平等性質之通商航海條約然循至今日此舉猶未實現吾人甚望在此航海條約中可將互相尊重内河航行權一點明文規定此在意人固毫無所損而在我國則頗可藉以打破各大享權國之恊調而有所裨益也</p>
<p>總之中意兩國誠欲謀眞正親善之道則不可不超越虚文而注重於實際吾人固歡迎兩國使節之升格而尤願意政府當局能推衍重視中國之精神以解决上述種種之懸案身負折衝重任之劉文島氏其更勉之哉</p>

<p>（倫敦）　出席海軍軍縮預備會商之日本政府代表山本五十六少將於十七日午後四時半起在日大使館接見日英美三國新聞記者團丶並應付英美兩國記者之質問丶關於出席預備會商丶闡明日本政府之立塲丶會約四十五分鐘丶其問答之情形大致如左丶</p>
<p>（問）「滿洲國」成立之結果丶關於遠東情勢以及軍縮問題受有若何之影響丶</p>
<p>（答）因滿洲建國丶而遠東關係愈形複雜丶是以日本海軍對於此點亦非充分考慮不可丶但「滿洲國政府」本身在最近之將來當未籌畫整備其海軍力也丶</p>
<p>（問）廢除比率主義其理由若何丶</p>
<p>（答）設立差别比率丶於各國國防權而被該項比率新束縛丶日本政府對於此種主義絶對反對丶</p>
<p>（問）日本政府所主張者爲國防權平等丶抑係噸數平等耶丶</p>
<p>（答）國防權平等乃日本政府之根本主張丶至於噸數及其他項數目丶意欲在預備會商加以討論丶英國政府意在保持多數巡洋艦丶美國政府則固執其大艦主義丶各國對於國防上之必要情形丶各有不同丶故以簡單數字而定其比率丶實爲不合理之辦法丶</p>
<p>（問）日本政府認爲必要之兵艦種類果若何丶</p>
<p>（答）此事雖未便具體討論丶如潛水艦等類丶則其一也丶</p>
<p>（問）爲何主張廢除航空母艦丶</p>
<p>（答）以爲此乃最烈之攻擊武器丶</p>
<p>（問）然則潛水艦非攻擊之武器乎丶</p>
<p>（答）余以爲斷非攻擊上之工具丶</p>
<p>（問）廢除海軍兵力比率丶倘不以廢除華府海約之手段行之丶能否以任何方法而促其實現乎丶</p>
<p>（答）不能丶</p>
<p>（問）在廢約以後丶有無避免造艦競爭之預備丶</p>

<p>本省警政丶過去殊少成績丶民廳近以本省連年災患丶地方瘡痍滿目丶爲减輕民衆負担計丶特擬定各縣公安局裁留暫行辦法丶將全年公安經費丶不滿五千元者丶或無經費丶係向人民臨時攤派者丶暫行裁撤改科丶併歸縣政府辦理丶計上項被裁之公安局丶隴南爲甘谷·兩當·隴東爲合水莊浪·隴西爲玉門·敦煌·等二十六縣丶餘如武都·成縣·文縣·康縣·等十一縣丶因接近匪區丶特將公安局改組爲縣保衛團常備隊丶以减輕民衆担負丶至於省會公安局附設之長警訓練所丶因係學術機關丶准其展廷時間丶以養成警察人才丶</p>
<p>本省保衛團之設施丶亦自本年開始丶昔日各縣民衆丶雖　自備槍械为捍衛地方者丶但無訓練丶無組織丶如領導不得其人丶往往走入歧途丶而爲地方之害丶民廳爲地方綏靖計丶乃於文縣等十一縣丶先後設立保衛團常備隊丶造成民衆武力丶使閭閣有自衛之準備丶盜匪無所施其狡技丶其辦法丶以縣長兼任常備軍隊大隊長丶另委大隊附襄助之丶自各縣設立常備隊之後丶匪患漸靖丶秩序亦臻安定丶</p>

<p>救濟丶本省年來丶迭遭巨災丶人民流亡丶不知其數丶故救濟事業丶急須設施現民廳除頒佈各縣府为促照内部頒發地方倉儲管理規則通令照辦外丶並提請省府丶准撥經常費丶於省城方面丶設立救濟院·借貸所·等救濟機關丶及蠲免被災税銀田糧丶最近各縣政府丶違令征收被災蠲免銀糧者丶亦經省府查明丶記過示懲丶</p>

<p>工部局衛生處長九月份報告云、是月疾病情形、惟腸胃病之傷不及痢疾爲盛、此類疾病、雖不及霍亂之烈、然亦亟待研究、惟尙未得何種結果、其勢殆非俟對於食品之預備、及牛乳之供給、得更爲有效之管理以後、難見低减也、</p>
<p>瘧疾一項、近亦見烈、其原因之一、係因居民漸散住於冷靜之區、致多受蚊蟲之害、又兩年以來、中區蚊蟲亦見滋多、此因最新造之樓房、多有建於基架之上、而架内空隙、遂爲蚊蟲滋生之所、其剷除極爲困難、此事現正加以研究、惟此係一新問題、各國注意及之者尙寡、故參攷材料極爲缺乏、</p>
<p>本月死亡率仍低、傳染病况除上述外、略如常、霍亂症不再見、因之注射汽車即於十月一日改行種痘、本季注射之人、全數只二四九·一零六人、雖宣傳甚力、然以霍亂少見、故人多不措意、露天游泳池九月底停閉、本年人數更超從前、門票增價、殊爲不得已之舉、然因此而不良分子乃見减少、泳池亦不致過擠、</p>
<p>學童體格檢查、現已正式舉行、得有材料不少、俟初步工作完畢後、當可採取適當行動、以應急需、</p>
<p>本月外僑出生率爲千分之十四·五四、華人出生經報告者二九八名、内二四一名、係本界居民、至於死亡者、則在華人中以肺癆·傷寒·痢疾·腸胃炎爲衆、</p>
<p>醫理試騐室、是月做試騐三·三八七次、内得正式反應者五四二次、飲食樣品經檢查者一七九件、内三十二件不及標凖、瘋大症診治室、求診者八十人、有九人係來自外埠、</p>
<p>華人隔離醫院、上月收錄五十五人、本月則增爲七十四人、死者十二人、因白喉入院者二十人、係最多之數天花則無之、神經病院、請求入院者數名、以無處可容、未能允准、</p>
<p>牛乳之出産、每日平均二九·三一零磅、較上月增百分之七强、牛乳樣品檢騐之結果、有四件不合化學標凖、二十二件不及細菌標凖、有夫役兩人、因運送無執照之牛乳、經送法院罰辦、肉品之供給、略如常態、因秋節之故、屠猪數特增、較上月加百分之十四·四、廢肉處置所、處分肉料五六·八九九磅、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c191">不是「異議」了 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>説來好笑，自家寫了一點投給「自由談」發表以後，就找不到自家的稿子了。那一天的「自由談」没有剪下來留着。所以今天讀了黄懷白先生的「讀了創作與時間的異議以後」，竟不能揀出自家「異議」來細細檢省一下。但黄先生的第一篇文章却還夾在信堆裏。兩面一比較，我對於黄先生是滿意了，因爲他這次第二篇文章裏已經説他「何嘗説到創作祇要有充分的時間而就可以抛却其他條件」了。</p>
<p>雖則就黄先生第一篇文章（九月十七「創作與時間」）細細辨味起來，實在不能不説他的議論的重心點是在「時間」二字，是把「其他條件」忽略了的，但現在我對於黄先生第二文的議論可算滿意了</p>
<p>不過黄先生這次又説「豈特如止水先生所説「生活經騐」，「觀察」和「思想」而已，還有「想像」，「感情」，和「描寫的技巧」等，這是可以訴諸「常議」而知道的」。善哉善哉丨把「想像」，「感情」也列爲「創作的要素」是頗已老了的」常議」，我是不大信任這樣的「常識」的，我是以爲「想像」和「感情」都是從「生活經騐」出發的，「生活經騐」不同的人們，其「想像」和「感情」也往往異趣，所以牠們未便並列着講。而且我記得我也不曾把「生活經騐」和「觀察」「思想」並列着講，如黄先生之所引證呵丨</p>
<p>而且我也不明白爲什麽一篇討論「創作與時間」的文章若使講到了生活經騐等等便稱「軼出了本題的話」？再者，因爲没有好創作而「希望作家們不要太珍惜時間」，而舉出十年二十年成一部書的「歷史上的例子」來，這是難怪人家以爲論者是「只限於死板板的時間關係」的罷？我因此覺得我前次的「異議」並不是一憑空臆斷」。倘使黄先生的第一文就像他此次第二文那樣的論調，我自然不説他的觀念只限於死板板的時間關係了。這不是很簡單的一回事麽？黄先生的第一文中毫無暗示到也有生活關係的話，我的「異議」舉出了「生活關係」，這樣難道就是抹煞别人的意見麽？</p>
<p>這次，黄先生又就我的「異議」中所舉的司各德和巴爾札克來説明他們倆都因爲債所迫，不得不過度工作。可知黄先生也承認他倆的創作並没有十年二十年推敲的工夫，然而黄先生旣不能否認他倆的作品全都不偉大，那麽，黄先生第一文中論據豈不是自己也輕輕推翻了麽？黄先生在第一文中説哥德「整整用了五十年工夫」才完成「浮士德」，這次他也轉灣過來説「大致如此」，而且説「至少吃飯，睡眠，讀書，談話，也要分了他的一部分時間去」，但其實那「五十年」中，哥德除了「吃飯，睡眠，讀書，談話」之外，還忙着别的事，所以還不是「大致如此」一句話就够了的；不過黄先生於此也把他第一文的論據自己推翻了。這此，我都是對於黄先生第二文滿足的理由，深幸我的「異議」未嘗「抹煞别人的意見」。</p>
<p>最後幾句話：黄先生這次文中又説「左拉的羅貢馬惹爾叢書也費了二十餘年的精力才寫成的」；這口氣頗有點跟黄先生第一文中的「十年二十年五十年」相信；但是左拉的二十年却寫了每本二十萬字左右的書一共二十卷呀丨拿年代來分配，左拉還是不「太珍惜時間的」呢丨至於黄先生此次説「所以現在還有人批評司各德作品裏内在的情緒和思想，都不十分眞實，左拉在描寫的技術上，也犯的拖沓的毛病。這些大作家因爲「多産」的關係，尙且不免微疵，其他更可想而知了」。這段話，應用得可稍稍有點「出邊」。司各德的「都不十分眞實」，因爲他用的不是寫實主義的手法，左拉的「拖沓」却一面有幾分和他的自然主義的理論有關係，一面是他的「風格」如此，並不能算是因爲「多産」所以不行了。</p>
<p>但是最有趣的是，我的「異議」舉了司各德他們一年寫一本大書來跟黄先生第一次文中所舉十年二十年五十年成一本書的例子作「異議」。而此次黄先生却顚倒用了司各德等事實來「敢説：止水先生所舉的司各德等在文壇上的榮譽，都是經過長時間的努力和辛苦獲得的」，這一來，眞呌單讀到黄先生第二文的人以爲我是把司各德他們的「榮譽」之獲得歸之於並未經過長時間的努力了。</p>
<p>但其實，我原來的説法却正是黄先生現在的説法。不過黄先生第一文只説十年二十年乃至五十年成一本書方能偉大，而我的「異議」却説以爲一年成一本書的作家也可以偉大，只要他的「生活經騐」富足，—當然也得有文學素養。而所謂「生活經騐富足」以及「文學素養」就是所謂「長時間的努力」，這「努力」也不能拿一本書寫作所佔的時間來死板板估量的。</p>
<p>倘使黄先生寫第一文的時候意念中没有「抛却其他的條件」，那麽，他的第一文的論調應該像他此次的第二文罷？再倘使他寫第二文的時候確把「二十年乃至五十年成一本書」跟司各德他們的「長時間的努力和辛苦」——這兩個説法分辨出本質上的不同，那他的第二文或者也不是現在的樣子罷？不過這是眞所謂「臆斷」了。還是不多説下去罷。</p>
<h3 id="c192">鄉下 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 夷</p>
<p>在城市住着，聽厭極了車馬喧囂的聲音，看厭極了牆壁屋瓦的灰色，總常常想到鄉下去，但到了鄉間，尤其是含着秋意的鄉間，却又使人不願長住，落一點子雨，把道路醬成泥濘，難於下足，這且不用講了，一望的樹木，披着黄綠雜呈的老葉，受着冷風的吹噓，瑟瑟縮縮地抖着，也就够人喪失去許多蓬勃的生氣。</p>
<p>你以爲那一株靠河的麻柳樹下，還可以抱着膝頭悠然地坐着，望一會兒浮在水上嘻戲的白鵝嗎？但不時總要從半黄和草中，嗅着狗糞那一類的氣息的。到一所院子去，首先看見的，便是飛舞在簷下的屎尿布片。院裏樹邊栓着的牛，也許已經牽開了，但牛糞和牛尿和着的乾稻草，却還惹眼的遺留着。在一張坐下去就要發出呌聲的矮森凳上坐着時，須要時時留意着你衣衫的下幅，不要呌牠掃着地上鷄撒的髒東西。起先向你汹汹吠着的狗，經過主人的叱責，挾着尾巴息聲之後，今又孩子似地走來用鼻頭嗅你，把嘴尖上偷吃猪食料的糠粃，點在你的鞋上。</p>
<p>「來看看，這間屋子好嗎？」</p>
<p>隨着主人進去，先前在屋樑上流蘇似地掛着粘有塵灰的蜘蛛網，已經掃去看不見了，還可以馬馬虎虎住下去，但從幾根森條做成的窗子望出去，給風抖着葉片的桑樹下面，正不歪不斜地對你放着兩個龐大的糞缸。想一想，把窗上略略糊有一屑黄色桐油的粗笨木門，拉來關着吧，但屋裏可就全暗了，看書是須要一枝洋蠟燭的。講究一點的人家，也許矮矮的瓦屋頂，還安置有一兩片玻璃瓦，然而不是灰漠漠的，便是有點暗黄，而且，有三五片枯黄的落葉。積在上面，也是説不定的。</p>
<p>有誰到上海附近的鄉下去租農家屋子，不得着這樣的印象呢？</p>
<p>不過，從車窗上，船窗上，馬背上所看見的鄉野，却是好的，富有詩意。然而，如果不曾抱有「改良農村」或「到民間去」的决心和勇氣，只是回到鄉下去吃老米飯，得一日過一日地住下去，那確實是走慣了柏油馬路，用慣了電燈自來水的人，所不能忍受的，何况今日的農村又都在一蹋糊塗崩潰着呢</p>
<p>可是，在一個長住在鄉下的農民看來，却没有對鄉下起過這樣紳士式的厭惡的，只要没有收税收租的拍門，拉伕拉兵的經過，以及無年不玩的戰爭，那就卽使和牛住在一個屋子，在下面放着鷄籠的桌上吃飯，也是怪滿意的。但事實上他們却被逼走了，永遠離開他們熟識的可愛的鄉下。如今鄕下已使鄉下人住不下去了，只是愛好鄉下的知識份子又那能不討厭？</p>
<p>所以今日要做「到民間去」的人，也得像上戰塲一樣，需要最大的勇氣的</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>無意地在黄昏以前溜到了離住處很遠的市塲，在那裏，無意地在書攤上盡我所有的錢拾了幾本破書，在走出門的時候被一個儼然老大哥似的朋友碰見了，又是那麽無意地呵丨</p>
<p>談着談着，我被邀進了一個戲院。讓多年被埋葬了的戲癮再睜一回眼吧。</p>
<p>人散，我到存車處取車，車上没有燈呢。爲了在夜晚出來的時候少，便不常擱在車上了。</p>
<p>「没燈不行呵！」</p>
<p>「還好天晴着，不下便好，我自己經過車行再買一只。」地下是微濕，是馬路，兩旁的水溝裏像小河似的在邊咽邊流着，這聲音令人想起江南自家門前的永不止息的流水了，不是有多少人都艷羨那小橋流水麽？</p>
<p>但現在是在隔着萬重山水的故鄉啊！</p>
<p>丨走吧，我自己在心裏嘰咕着，唯見那善意的中年人走遠了以後。摸摸袋子，是空的。</p>
<p>緊靠着左走，像夜半的偷兒似的，想躱過警察的視綫，他們要干涉的哪，特别是想省電石和洋車多，是時常被兇狠的呵斥停步的，直到點上燈以後。</p>
<p>使死勁兒地踏着，讓車滑得飛快地，心是輕微地跳動着，警亭是那麽多啊，那底下站着一個黑制服的。</p>
<p>可惜他没有生四面的眼睛哩。我暗笑了，看見自己逃過了頭一個警站後，那黑制服的正背對着我。</p>
<p>我借光着一路上有車燈的，緊隨着，一到警站便悄斜着點，頂好有隠身術啊。街傍的一棵挨着一棵的有着密葉的樹上漏下積存着的雨點來，穿過頭髮，頭上怪凉的，手上𩓐子上也盡接着微凉的點滴。</p>
<p>「女車點燈，那女車丨」終於被逮住了。</p>
<p>「給他個不理得啦，貓捉耗子！」默默地又滑了過去。</p>
<p>一次又一次的被喝着，簡直的差點没被扣住，打了敗仗了，得，俺投降。我下了車，在行人道上推着車走。故宮博物院門前的大燈照得挺得勁兒，我還没去過呢，半塊錢看一路的門票哇。儘顧着東瞧西看，脚下可老踩泥塘子了，水打破皮鞋的縫兒裏躦進來，泡濕了兩隻脚。進了胡同更苦了，人家説北平的胡同是無風三尺土，那許有點謊，雨天一尺泥是的確有的，幾次，脚像伸在小罎子裏似的難拔啊。到了住處的階沿上。我的脚像塗了黄土的松花。</p>
<p>小胡同裏，賣硬麵　　的吆喝着，聲音是那麽孤獨的，歪揹着的筐子像很沉重，雨天，哪兒來的買主呢。謝謝他的手提燈，照見了我所敲的門環。</p>

<p>— Lang　ton　Hughes作　佛朗譯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在僑商旅館的應接室裏有六個大的銅痰盂丨每個角落放着一個，一個放在當中，一個則放近在註册員的桌子。辛弟的職責，就是清理這些痰盂。在冬天的每晚，他放學之後便從後門跑進這所旅館，他把書放在收藏他的掃帚和揩布的壁櫉裏，打掃那兩間狹小的晚餐間，樓梯·拂拭應接室的灰塵，然後拿這些痰盂把黏質的痰塊倒到巷子裏，用水漂過，拭光牠們，直至牠們好像是金製的一樣光亮。除了清理時有一點臭味之外，辛弟是此較歡喜這一件工作的。他常常覺得他自己很可驕傲，大約六點鐘光景，他便可以瞧見道骯髒古老的應接室裏那六個以前是一再積滿痰塊而現在是發亮的痰盂，在映着電燈發光，這是他自己用自己的雙乎。和靠着擦銅油來使牠增加光耀的，從不失望地使辛弟覺得愉快。</p>
<p>他歡喜清理東西·把牠們弄得漂亮，弄得光彩，他的老祖母海格爾也是這樣：當她不洗衣服的時候，常常打掃屋子裏的東西，揩拭樓梯或者洗刷厨房的地板，直至足够白凈才止。一件打理過的東西，在海格爾婆婆是覺得漂亮的，同樣在辛弟也是覺得漂亮，他每晚驕傲着他的六個乾凈的銅痰盂。雖然每天當他來工作的時候，牠們重又被烟草汁，香烟頭，香口糖的滓渣和痰涏裝滿，但清理牠是辛弟的工作丨丨當打理乾凈時，牠們又是漂亮了。</p>
<p>差相納脱是説得不錯丨丨這工作並没有什麽很苦的事，他歡喜牠祇有那麽一下子時間。他在旅館裏所見的種新生活使他感到興趣和迷惑，但他生成是一個恬靜孩子，他没有什麽要問的問題，除開對他工作的指導人，没有誰告訴他什麽事。辛弟打掃工也做得很好，這茶房頭還没機會去叱駡他，因爲他是時常叱駡那兩個管按鈴的孩子的。</p>
<p>這僑商旅館不是一間大旅館，也並不是一間精緻的旅館。一座三層樓的建築物，已經傾頽得要倒下去，好些年没有粉飾過了。在應接室裏面，兩扇大玻璃瞧到街上，在前面是幾行硬木頭的椅　。在應接室的後部是註册員的桌子，一盒雪茄和香烟，一壼冷水，門是通到男厠所的，打掃這厠所也是辛弟的職任。</p>
<p>樓上二三樓是臥室。僅是那些很可憐的行商和暫住的鐵路工人來光顧，偶然一些演藝員，和街頭的女人和她們的主顧來租賃牠們。在橋商旅館裏，晚上的生意常常是最爲忙碌的，但這僅是在每個禮拜六而已，那晚辛弟工作在六時後開始，要直到十時或者十一時還不能回家，但他的祖母海格爾常是等候他，暖着火，裝滿一桶水留給他每個禮拜一次的洗澡。</p>

<p>古時候、有個國王、非常暴虐、一天、他要經過某城、城裏的人民得着這個消息、都很恐慌、因爲國王若到城内、護從的飲食、都要他們供給、他們　愛的東西國王看見了也要奪去、於是、他們召集了羣衆、討論札止國王進城的辦法、</p>
<p>一個聰明的人提議説、「我們最好伐取林中的大樹、把那些樹幹、樹枝横架在路上、使國王不得進城、一羣衆聽了　都拍手贊成、不久他們便把城外四面的道路、都用木材寨住了、</p>
<p>國王要進城了、見大小各路、都不通行、只得改道而去、臨走的時候、對一個鄉人説、「你去對城裏的人説、我遲早要派兵隊入城、把他們的鼻子、一律割去、」</p>
<p>鄉人立刻赶到城裏、報告國王説的話、城裏的人民又著了慌他們誥即台集全城的老幼、商議保護鼻的方法、</p>
<p>開會的時候、大家商議了好久、没有計策、正在一籌莫展的當兒有一個少年説、「我們旣然用智慧阻止國王進城、還該用智慧保護我們的鼻子、我想、國王派兵隊來、先要捕捉聰明的人、所以我門只要扮作愚人就行了、」衆人都以爲是、就决定大家扮做愚人、並且做出愚笨的事、</p>
<p>國王回到宮裏心裏很不愉快、立刻派了一隊强悍的兵士、騎了快馬趕到　個城、去實踐他的話、</p>
<p>兵隊到了城外、看見幾個老人把石塊運到山上、軍官駐馬問道、「你們把石塊運到同上、做甚麽、」他們説、「我們把山加高此、使太陽早此上升、」軍官笑道、愚人們、太陽上升的時間、完全受自然的支配用不着你們想法的、」老人們不信軍官的話、仍然搬運不息、（未完）</p>

<p>第三回　永解　零臨門憐少女　聞困苦惜天訪　家</p>
<p>茶房道；人到了賣兒賣女，那也就先圖一飽再説，這些事情，也就顧不得了。那年大旱，陜西女人，嫁到山西去的，總有好幾萬，無非今天説好了價錢，明天就走，那個顧得了以後的事？我們也只聽得災民嫁了出去，可没有聽到説再回來的。就説剛才來的遇女孩了，便是他上面兩代人願意賣了他，也就不容易找受主。程志前道；他上面兩代人，也無非是想找個地方吃飯，就隨便招贅一個女婿也就是了，何必要把這孩子賣給人作小。茶房笑道；程先生，你想想。没有錢的人，那裏討得起他，還要替他養兩代人呢。有錢的人，那個肯正正經經，娶一個逃難的女孩子，程志前點點頭，似乎許可他這話的意思，慢慢的在廊檐下鍍着來回步子，揣想着茶房所説的言語。忽然笑；我想起一句話來了。於是掉轉身來，向茶房看看。茶房笑道；程先生若是願意要這個女孩子，話好説，我可以同你跑腿。程志前連連的搖着頭笑道；不是，不是。你剛纔對那姑娘説，後面還有洋窰洞子，這件事，我就有些不解了。窰洞子本就是西北獨有的土製東西，怎麽着也和洋字不能發生關係。你説的洋洞子，那又是那國的樣式呢？茶房笑道；説洋式的，那不過是説洞子作得好，那裏有過窰洞子呢？程志前道；由洛陽到西安，這一路的窰洞子我倒是參觀過。那極壞的，簡直就是個野獸的洞，進洞門就伸不直腰，裏面漆漆黑黑的。伸手就摸着洞壁上的土。裏面是什麽氣味都有，可是什麽東西也没有。（四三）</p>
<h3 id="c228">前清的奴才 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>你們知道，前清的奴才是何等樣人　我知心定有許多人回答，是娼，優·隸·卒之類。哈哈不對丨在前清，有奴才資格的，不是平民百姓，却是滿洲人做官的，他們的奴才資格是十足道地，毫無異議的，原來他們在皇帝面前，是自稱奴才，不用人家呼爲奴才，而他們先自承認了。</p>
<p>在最近本報所載「御香縹緲錄」裏，叙及袁世凱覲見太后，自稱奴才，幾天後有一段附啟文字，説有某君投函糾正，清制漢官應自稱臣云云，這個掌故，記得我大約在十一二歲時。聽到先父講過的，現在，我尙可趁此機會一談。我不曾研究過史學，不知這一回事正史上有叙入没有？並不知有錯處没有？這些，我暫且不管。</p>
<p>大清會典是明末遺臣洪承疇手訂的。滿清建國之初，清廷極契重洪氏之才，要强迫他投順，又將上館，美色使他軟化。可是，洪氏不爲所屈，後來竟决心絶粒殉他的故國，每天祇飲白水少註解渴羆了。眞是作怪丨經過半個月的飢餓歷程，洪氏不但生命照常，而且顔色轉好；他也不得不歎爲天意不　他守這愚忠了丨他終於灑涙北向，拜辭了他的故君在天之靈，投降清室。原來清廷得知了洪氏絶食的消息，對於他的忠忱不覺肅然起敬，又實在捨不得他的大才，就暗命在他左右伺候的人，在清水内滲和入參湯而進，所以他得不死。這一個小小的詭計，居然使他上了大大的老當丨</p>
<p>洪承疇旣受命制定大清會典，却也從中使乘巧，好似存心報復的一般，也給滿洲人上一個當。他在大清儀注中訂有一條，「凡百官朝見，或啟奏皇上，滿官應自稱奴才，漢官應自稱臣。」這分明是教滿洲官自甘儕於奴隸之列。其後雖也有不大愚笨的滿臣，幾覺着這「自稱奴才」是不很體面的，無奈這已習爲祖宗成法，像鐵鑄着的一般，不可更變了！</p>
<p>如今，清朝遜國後已二十年，不料曾做主子的廢帝，竟還會給日本人搬弄着，奴蓄着，更有一班滿漢新舊臣僕，得意揚揚地當着奴才的奴才，這樣的愈趨愈下，應是洪承疇當年所萬不及料的啊！</p>

<p>怎樣愉快的事情啊！在這苦雨的當兒，那薄薄的雲堆中間，推出了半灣殘月。</p>
<p>清幽溫柔的亮光，像慈母的手指，撫摩了窗帘，撫摩了桌上的瓶花，慢慢的近來撫摩我一頭亂髮，再悄悄地輕移過去，撫摩了其他的一切，小樓處處，融化在自然的懷抱裏，我也被它陶醉了。</p>
<p>窗外沿街的一顆梧桐，滿頭載着綠葉，搖曳着枝幹，似在點頭作笑。月光映着樹影，遍洒在窗上，地板上，墻壁上，都佈滿了天然的圖案彩色，疎落有致，誰也不能書到這樣的神妙。鋼琴伴着梵俄鈴交奏的聲音，不時地飄進室中，是Ｓｗｒｅｎａｄｅ曲調罷，這般的婉轉，這般的迷人，萬疊閒悉，一齊消散到不知何處去了。</p>
<p>枝上樹葉，悉索作聲，一陣輕微的秋風裏，吹進了幾隻嫩綠的秋蟲。他們跌落在地面上，好像怕人似的，大家跳躍個不停。我想起每當失眠的時候，賴了他們喞喞的吟聲，來消磨那無聊的長夜，今朝偶然想逢，還是伴着寄人籬下的客子，留　室中，度過這新凉的秋夜吧</p>

<p>從明亮晶瑩的鏡子裏，輝映出自己枯瘦的殘容，生活的狼狽，看着這樣的面顔，可以很明顯地象徵着。</p>
<p>蓬飛散亂，含有强撓性的頭髮，眼看着，經那已被酒精燈燒得火熱箝子·把頭髮很順利，很服貼，一批一批的制壓得很平靜，那時，每次箝子和頭髮相觸時候，就是頭髮遭箝子凌壓的時光，這聲浪，這頭髮吱吱的聲浪，哀憐的微音，是不斷的散佈着，散佈得渾身的肌肉都緊張，顫慄；有時凌壓得史强烈此，利害些，連那皮肉也遭到無辜的痛苦哩</p>
<p>這是一件多麽愚魯的　事呀！好好地，很自然的頭髮，生把它强制高壓，學那削足就履，來求美觀，眞是何苦呢，難道大然的是没美的存在嗎？</p>
<p>再從這小小的事情丨燙髮丨留給我多少的刺激，和啟示，它已明顯地曉示我，現今的世界，什麽和平，什麽廢戰，什麽……一切都是虚僞不過罩上一層假面具罷了，那頭髮，經了火熱箝子的强壓，不是就俯首帖耳像小羊一般的溫存了嗎！祇有强者，纔能站在勝利的戰綫上，我還暗自在反省着，農村已崩潰到這樣的不景氣地步，但我，自己還是這樣漠然無關的很命浪化，不是太不自愛了麽？也許是和鄉村太隔膜的主因吧</p>

<p>秋是漸漸地深了。都市中的摩登男女，都已換上新裝；尤其是一　少　小姐。有的披着淺黄的短褂，有的披着彩色的圍巾，那種具有曲綫美的旗袍，固然玉立可愛；而一班短裙肥腿的學生裝，却也充滿着健　丰韻，瞧在吳先生的眼中，委實覺得他人的服裝，太落伍了，至少是進得衣莊，可充喝賣的古衣冠了。</p>
<p>吳先生這天，總算把那打過八折的薪水，領到了手，他乾　的袋裏，袋着　張挺硬的中國銀行五元鈔票，和六塊大洋，那銀元震動時輕微的碎響，使吳先生的精神振作了許多。他挺起胸脯，在人行道上走着，照照女人，聽聽那唱得怪好聽的無綫電，眞覺其樂無涯，飄飄欲仙。</p>
<p>「紥蟹呢人紥蟹。」那宛宛的賣蟹聲，和小筐中青褐色拳頭大的紥蟹，照到吳先生的眼裏耳裏，不由心裏瑟的　動。</p>
<p>蟹，是吳先生嗜好的食品，可是已闊别多時　這天他因着袋裏的十六塊錢，想自己酬勞一下，　幾隻來大嚼　頓。於是他喚停了賣蟹者，問他幾錢　斤。</p>
<p>一先生，不討虎頭；别人一塊錢斤半，先生買，每元一斤十兩，」道巨大的價格，不由吳先生心裏劃算。這　蟹，每隻至少五兩，照現在十三兩六錢市秤計算，就是　塊錢也買不到六隻蟹，假使　塊錢買伙食，至少可支持五天。吳先生想到了伙食問題，連帶想到房錢，想到妻身上的秋衣，一切的一切，終於把他的食慾過了下去，急匆匆趕回家去。</p>
<p>吳先生一踏進門，他的夫人，正在辟拍地和他的妹妹，還有兩個鄰居又小麻雀，小小的客堂，懸空斜放着　桌麻雀和四隻椅子，眞覺得無迴旋的餘地。吳先生瞧在眼裏，心裏微微發生感慨；這樣的環境，他的妻還要又麻雀，似乎太不體諒自己了，然而　瞧到他妻黄黄的臉，和不合時的衣着，覺得這一些些娛樂，都不給妻享受，眞太寡情了；何况妻又的麻雀，又是一千文　底的最起碼的小麻雀。</p>
<p>然而這嘈雜的環境，吳先生固然不能在客堂中幹什麽事兒；房中呢，光綫太暗了，連看書多不大便利，終於吳先生是倒在床上，想覓片時的小睡，可是因着外商的隆隆的辟拍的牌聲，和妻子們喧笑咒晋的聲音，攪得吳先生非但不能睡覺，他心中的思潮，反掀得怒濤般的翻騰起來。</p>
<p>他想到以前的大家庭，高廰大屋，現在却住钊人家無異門房的矮；而上多　來的掙扎奮鬥，雖然勉强的生活，可以維持過去，然而一所復一年的不要説飛黄騰達，毫無希望，就是環境，要稍稍改善一此，也覺力自不逮。少年時光大門户的志願，不由得完全消了。</p>
<p>那隆隆辟拍的牌聲，一聲聲傳進吳先生耳中，彷彿一顆顆爆裂的炸彈，委實震得吳先生腦漲心煩。於是吳先生因惡劣的環境，連帶恨那低矮的房屋，恨到妻的惡作劇，那陣陣的煩惱，使吳先生再也不能安睡床上。</p>
<p>他刷的坐起身來，虎虎地趕到客堂裏，那青青的面孔，不由那一桌又麻雀的人，都遏住了笑聲，只默默地搓牌。他的妻的臉龐，也由黄　青，怪怖人的，不由使吳先生的怒火，遏　下去，再一瞧伊舊式的衣衫，心是跳着，再也發不出火。於是他把袋中的十六塊錢，一起掏了出來擲在妻的面前，茫然地跨出門去。蒼茫的暮色，漸漸地把吳先生的背影吞了下去。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第十六章　老佛爺安抵故鄉</p>
<p>我們一進了東三省，因爲靈感上的作用，似乎覺得空氣中，</p>
<p>已換了一種和先前不同的氣息；再望車外看看，那些田野的景象，也似乎覺得有些異樣。然而要是眞的教我説出它們畢　有什麽物異之點，那也就回答不出來了！總之，這種感覺，凡在我們初入某一帶陌生的地方去的時候，都會不期然而然的發生的。其時我們的列車，好像也比往常開得快了許多，大槪是它一路老是被迫着慢慢地滾過來，自己也有些不痛快了。</p>
<p>東三省有一種植物；是非常有名的，也許世界各國的人士，都有知道的，那便是「高梁」。我也是慕名已久。而不曾見過的一個人；所以在出了山海關之後，一有空，便憑着車窗，盡力的眺望，可是望了好久，没有看見什麽物别的植物。最後，我就去請問那精研植物學的太監，他便笑着給我指點了出來。原來那時候高梁還不曾長成，出土不過一兩尺長，所以看見了，還當是麥子咧丨據説再過幾個月工夫，這些高梁就會長得跟人一樣高了，而且它的葉子很濃密，種的人家又多，因此到它們長成的時候，西自山海關起，東至高麗交界爲止，這一整方土地以内，簡直是像舖上了一張青色的絨氈一樣。人從較高的所在望下去，但見一片青色，所有一切比較矮小的房屋，和溪流池沼，以及其他的各種植物，全給高梁遮得影見都不見了丨所以東三省人往往稱那個時期爲「青紗帪」起的時期。（一五三）</p>

<h3 id="c247">宴會不忘國恥 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>十四日報載，魯省决議，公務員宴會頭等菜十八個，名「九一八」，中等十一，名「一二八」，小菜八，名「五三」，據稱「以示不忘國恥」云云。</p>
<p>我們回憶當前一兩年，東北陸沉，華北及各地邊陲告急，全國民衆憤國亡之無日，如喪考妣，蓋因不肖黄帝子孫，已深深領受「同文同種共榮」的「實惠」，痛之切而哀之深也。但有不少享樂慣了的朋友，覺得這種「居喪茹素」的空氣，未免太嚴肅，就呌出救國不忘娛樂，救國不忘……的呼聲。待到人們精神麻痺，復又易以娛變救國，跳無救國等的號召，因之在一陣飛機大砲轟炸之後，又呈管絃歌舞，一片歡樂之聲。</p>
<p>這些現象，説明國難國恥等印象，在一部份人中由淡而忘的過程，今竟於宴會先生們吃十八餚八大碗之時，强聒以「九一八」「一二八」「五三」等的名稱，使人惕勵，實可敬偑。惟未審那些高軒蒞臨的嘉賓，於哪擾郇廚而嘗試了「九一八」「一二八」「五三」之後，不知「口角留香」的是山珍海味的滋味呢，或者還是於這些國恥國難中身殉同胞的血肉腥氣？亦未知於碰盃相飮時，因一宴會的名稱而「不忘」了「國恥」，應悲懷祖國表示哀輓呢，或者還是不醉無歸？一方面要賓主盡歡，一方面要「不忘國恥」，使吃東道的人「啼笑皆非」，定難爲情！</p>
<p>當平瀋通車之時，在餐車上木屐朋友饗我們以「互惠湯」，敬領之後，不見得是甚麽「互惠」，然則又何能望吃「九一八」「一二八」「五三」的人們，於觥籌交錯中，「不忘國恥」！</p>
<h3 id="c248">紅蓼花殘 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>籠在曉霧里的鶯脰湖，是迷人的，每天，禮拜堂的鐘聲，喚回了我遠游的夢魂，我便披着晨衣，迎着鶯脰湖的淺笑，我緩緩地踱着，我用着一份詩人似的態度，把鶯脰湖的一花一草，都訪問遍了，鶯脰湖的一顰一笑，我也領受够了，於是，我迷戀着籠在曉青里的鶯脰湖，深深地，深深地。</p>
<p>初秋的鶯脰湖，是更迷人的，近水的淺灘上，是一簇簇的紅蓼花，籠在曉霧里的紅蓼花，是迷人的，正如籠在曉霧里的鶯脰湖一樣，而秋的憂鬱，烘染上這個初秋的鶯脰湖，是一副姜艷的畫圖，這，對於一個受過創傷的年青人，是一種很好的傷心資料，然而，這個美麗的環境，是不允許我，也不慫恿我，痛器流涕，而只是一點淡淡的憂鬱，淡淡的憂鬱，我，也就樂於這淡淡的憂鬱，停止了奔波的旅程。</p>
<p>淺灘上的紅蓼花，褪殘了呢！�</p>
<p>我照例披着晨衣，緩緩地踱着，我將去餞加那褪殘了的紅蓼花，然而，當我漸漸的，踱近水灘的時候，其餘是同樣地毫無更改，鶯脰湖依舊是籠在曉霧里淺笑，秋柳的柔條，依舊是一抺淡淡的憂鬱，可是，在那紅蓼花傍，是有着一個紫色衣裳的女郎，曉風飄動着她的紫色的衣袂，雖説，我僅僅是看清了她的背影，但，這背影，宛然是一個「日暮倚修竹」的懷着幽怨的絶代佳人，或者這是神話中的花神月妖。</p>
<p>疾望着這背影是慢慢的消失了，我悵悵的歸麥，每天，當我披着晨衣，緩緩地踱着的時候，這位紫色衣裳的姑娘，總已立在那紅蓼花傍，而且，我是永遠只見她的背影的，而且，我每天痴望着這背影慢慢的消失。</p>
<p>然而，在第二個安息好的清晨，我已不能再見這紫色衣裳的姑娘了，並且，從此不能再見，一直到今日，是整整的五長年了哪！</p>
<p>可是紅蓼花殘的時候，也許，鶯脰湖依舊是籠在曉霧里淺笑，可是，這紫色衣裳的姑娘！還依舊是無恙嗎！當我對着這一簇腿殘了的紅蓼花時，我要爲這位紫色的衣裳姑娘祝福。</p>

<p>頭頂上烏鴉噪着。</p>
<p>丨媽的！他退後了兩步。吐一口涎沫又向前走了。</p>
<p>秋陽灑滿了馬路，許多許多的腿西裝褲管的，長褲脚的……踐踏着過去了。他感到眼花錯亂，好像這大都市中祗有他一個是無職業的，那樣蹣跚地拖在人羣後面。</p>
<p>走過許多同樣的馬路，綢緞舖子門前飄着大减價的旂幟·人，肩頭擠着肩頭在那裏出進，大包小紮的在面前幌過，他注視到自己身上的破單衫，頸項間滲出了微微的汗珠，便埋着頭望着自家兒的脚尖向前走了。</p>
<p>到達月友的家，已是他出門後的一小時了。</p>
<p>朋友不在家，他女人招待到臥室。他視綫投到角落裏，那邊新置着一具搖籃，一個新生的孩子睡着，但是這臥室反見闊餘了，他記不起搖籃的地位少了件什麽家私。</p>
<p>坐一會罷，Ｘ先生，他就要回來的。」</p>
<p>他退步坐到床上。</p>
<p>「這孩子生了多少時候了？」</p>
<p>「不滿一個月哩。」</p>
<p>孩子哭了，母親從搖籃裏抱起來逗着，「呌聲伯伯」便搖着搖着下樓去了。</p>
<p>他站起身來向臥室巡視了一周，好像什麽地方都是生疏似的。來回踱了幾步，脚尖老碰着什散物件，才想起伸手到衣袋裏，掏了個空，没有帶烟盒出來。退身坐到床上，瞥見枕邊一盒烟，拿過來却是空的，隨手扔了。</p>
<p>偶然瞧見桌上的時鐘已是十二點，他記起妻子抱着空鍋子等他，就起身向外走，樓梯口朋友的妻子出現了，兩個人　住在房門口。</p>
<p>「Ｘ先生，再坐一會，他就要回來的。」</p>
<p>「到那裏去的？」</p>
<p>「那···恐怕看朋友去的，」</p>
<p>樓梯口像漆一樣，他瞧不見什麽，似乎朋友的妻子退步下樓去，就一步踏着一步下樓來。</p>
<p>「回來説一聲我來看過他的。」</p>
<p>「他就要回來的，Ｘ先生，吃了飯去？」</p>
<p>送出後門，他頭也不回走了。</p>
<p>秋陽灑滿了馬路，許多許多的腿丨西裝褲管的，長褲脚的，……踐踏着過去了，他感到眼花錯亂，好像這大都市中祗有他一個是無職業的，那樣蹣跚地拖在人羣後面。</p>
<p>到家，妻子在門口等着，側身讓了他，跟着進去　。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>「没有………？」</p>
<p>「看朋友去了！」</p>
<p>默默地坐着，時鐘已十分過了一點。妻子猛地跑下樓去，上來授給他一封信。</p>
<p>「剛才寄來的。」</p>
<p>面上展開了苦笑，謹愼地啟了封。讀過後隨手撕成粉片扔了。</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>没有回答，從抽頭裏掏出烟捲來抽着。</p>
<p>妻子俯下身去，拾起較大的紙片，那上面寫着··</p>

<p>頭髮的香，嘴的唇，胭脂的香，半裸的白色的有機塑像，半裸的金色的有機塑像，活動的春浴圖呀。</p>
<p>濫冷着，旅轉着，没邊際的桃色的激情的交流…………</p>
<p>跳呵，跳呵，誰都在推着誰下海。於是一個一個先生後後的投進去了，蟬魚似地，蟬魚式的女人呀！</p>
<p>隨着每支音樂在每個男子的胸懷裏邊溜着一支溜進那個的身邊，一支又溜進這個的身邊。</p>
<p>跳呵跳呵，需要興奮呵，都那麽歇斯迭里地説着，一邊説，一邊就摟着女人的腰支駛開去，飄飄地。</p>

<p>半閉着眼珠，抽着烟，虚出白漢漢的烟霧，在幻想着··</p>

<p>一時是會忘記了自己的存在，也遺落了寂寞的影子的。</p>
<p>批評家回來又慫恿他，也明星回來也鼓動他。誰個回來都同樣地説。</p>
<p>説的他心誰有些晃晃了。</p>
<p>便想着。老瞧人家跳實在邊不够味道，媽的，就玩個痛快吧！也下海了。大家嘻嘻地笑着説，可是他却咬着牙根。</p>
<p>立刻患了烟土披里純症了。一下海就沉到水底深處。這樣地一支進一支，這樣地樓進一個女人又一個女人。踏着拍子，踏着華維茲的迂緩的旋律。作夢似的跳着跳着。</p>
<p>未坐下來，又追着呌起的銅鈸駛開舞步去。背後幾個人在鼓掌。然而就在跳着的時候，他如是咬着牙根的，没限女人説一名話。係抱住一塊木頭，來顧似的轉來轉去。</p>
<p>在痛苦裏邊，找尋快樂的人啊。</p>
<p>二點鐘以後。有些累了。感到你抽出了氣的皮球，似的，連吸呼都没了勁。便走出門。</p>
<p>夜街上，雨已放晴，秋天深夜裏的風却够的，一吹。身上的暖熱全失消下來，換上來滿心凄凉的感覺。</p>

<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>秋，已經是來到人間了。</p>
<p>瑞，一個瘦弱的青年人，他迎着秋風一步步向六榕寺走去。當他走到了寺邊小門的時候，他站住着脚，好像尋思什麽似的呆住着，約莫有十分鐘的時間，他才放大脚步，走上了石級。</p>
<p>六榕寺，這已經很多年代的古寺，一到了秋天，就蒙上了一層蕭索的情調，那榕樹已經是染上了濃厚的黄色，枯葉好似雛鳥到了換毛的時期，隨着秋風的在紛紛地飛散着。一種幽凉的，寂靜的，悲愁的景色，很動人的在這古寺中流露出來。</p>
<p>他這時看着眼前的這一幅幽靜的景色，這使他那一顆寂寞的心，是更加的沉愁着了。他好似失却了靈魂的呆坐在那樹蔭下的石凳上，瘦黑的手，撫摸着他那散亂的頭髮在沉默着。</p>
<p>秋，是愉快的，美麗的，溫柔可愛的節季呀丨</p>
<p>秋日是多末的短促呀丨那太陽，一刹那已經溜到樹後去了，那寺裏大殿的石階上，已蒙上一重重地黑影，幽靜的寺裏，遊人是漸漸地稀少了，在這古寺中，就只有瑞獨自一個寂寞的坐着。</p>
<p>太陽的金光，從那樹後射出一個個蛋形的影子，好像花紙似的印在那殿門兩旁的牆上，瑞，他張着兩眼，很出神的看着，在他的腦中，二年前的往事，又如幻影似的浮現出來。</p>
<p>那是他和鳴二人將要離開的時候，鳴拉着他一同的走到這名勝的古寺來。因爲兩人都是感覺到離開的寂寞和不安，所以，在那石凳上，總是默默地的對望着。鳴看到了那牆上的葉影，緊拉着瑞的手説出話來。</p>
<p>「瑞，你看，那葉影印在牆上多末好看呀，我先和你約定，二年後的這個時候，我倆再在這裏見面吧丨只要是葉影在牆上的秋天的午後，你想好嗎」？</p>
<p>「唔，二年後？好吧丨你這次去了，我也希望能够如你所説的這一天，我們再在這裏見面的。不過，我以爲事不是那樣可以决定的吧？我也説不定，就要離開這裏了。」</p>
<p>「無論如何，我們就這樣約定吧丨總有這個日子到來的」。</p>
<p>瑞，他想到「總有這個日子到來的」的這一句，心中就感到很難過的不敢再想下去了，因爲今天，就是那時約定的日子呀！可是鳴，終於没有到來，只有他孤獨的坐在石凳上。他心中在想「鳴和我約定，爲什麽他就走到另一個世間去呢」？</p>
<p>太陽已經溜過西半球去了，黄昏的秋風，刮到身上，已到有點冷了，瑞，他却還坐在這四處寂靜了的寺裏，有如落葉的飽受了秋風的摧殘，呆望着那大殿旁的牆壁，在回想着他友人鳴的那種爲革命而死的情形。一直的到了四下裏都模糊，而已是夜神到了的時候，他才站起來，踏着沉重的脚步，走出了六榕寺之門。可是瑞的腦海中，却也更深的印上六榕寺之秋的景象了。</p>

<p>普拉丁在易卜生的回憶中，曾這樣的説過；「像夫羅麥恩爾所説的一樣；人類因爲是愚，才會變成惡的東西。但易卜生則説是人類因爲是惡，才會變成爲愚不可及。」</p>
<p>如果把二人的話作爲比較的時候，那是非常之奇突有趣了，因爲，假定遵照夫羅麥恩爾底人類是愚魯的，來觀察人世的時候，那在人世上將没有善良的人類存在了。然如果遵從易卜生的立塲來觀察的時候，則在人類中，又將没有愚人的了。同時，如果將易卜生的話倒移到道德論的地位上來的時候，那麽世界上將没有一樣東西會比人類更賢惠的了。</p>

<p>— 雁</p>
<p>中國自從有新文學以來，完全走的是西洋文學之路，可是，不用説愛好文學的青年，就是文藝作家吧，有幾個對於西洋文學有着專門的研究？退一步説，就是對於西洋文學有着相當研究的人，對於每一民族的文學個别有着深刻地專門地研究的人，實在眞如鳳毛麟角。這是誰都不能否認的事實。我們愛好文藝的青年，説句老實不客氣的話，我們對於文壇上的在努力文藝運動的作家，并不止光是希望他們創作出有意義有價値的作品，而且亦希望他們給我們介紹一些文學上的基本的與甚至一般的學識。然而，我們的成名作家，却是大多數在爲自己的維持生活與風頭的目標上打算，他們全不顧及我們的期望。文學雜志的「編輯作家們」（因爲他們是作家而兼編輯）却又是只在發表野人頭的粗製濫造的作品以廣招睞。對於文學上的基本的與甚至一般的學識，他們是不想設法教育我們的。而一班商業化的編書家所出版的各種文學上的基本的與甚至一般的學識的書，那是淺薄而又謊謬得無以復加。就連我們智識份子都要失望，一班提倡大衆交學運教育大學的先生所努力的對象丨大衆，那更是無從説起了。最近「現代」雜志出版「現代美國文學專號」，在廣告上先結我們一個欣幸的興奮的感覺，到了買到一本來讀，更是令人滿意，而引起研究一個民族的文學的興趣來了。「現代美國文學專號」第一件給我們的東西，是告訴我們想要研究西洋文學，從那裏得到文學上的修養所必備的學識的人，是應該從個别的民族文學專門地研究。這一種研究，不但可以希望得到豐富的專門的文學上的學識，而且可以引起對於研究西洋文學的濃厚的興趣。第二件給我們的東西，是介紹了美國的文學的有系統的與文學各部門的學識給我們，使我們認識的美國文學是怎麽一種文學，她的特點在那裏，她的價値是怎樣，丨這一種認識，固然一本雜志的編幅所限只能得給我們一個槪念，可是這一個槪念已經够我們愛好文學的青年的初步修養了。</p>
<p>這是我讀了「現代美國文學專號」後的感想，同時有幾個與我同樣愛好文學的朋友亦有以上所説的同機感想，因此我認爲「現代美國文學專號」是應該推薦給一般愛好文學的青年同志們。</p>

<p>— 楚樓</p>
<p>鬧市，</p>
<p>街上吹着初秋的風，女職員跟輕捷的蝴蝶一樣，一隻又一隻，按着令時的秋裝，抱着一本大書，走向她們奥非司去。</p>
<p>資本家從黄金國，從地中海，從英偷，運來各式各樣新奇的商品，投下鉅大的資本，造成了繁榮的上海。</p>
<p>但是商店的廣告橱上，ＳＥＡＬ已經成了不可少的默綴，反正一年，有四季，季季可廉價，除外還有一週年，兩週年……廉價是廉不完的。</p>
<p>人，就像春潮般的湧湃，湧湃，我在人堆裏受不得那股子低氣壓的望，無奈地望着天空，天空中却也錯綜着電流的風。</p>
<p>一連轉了兩三個彎，就像躱避一條凶狠的狼，我走進一段廦冷的街，頭腦清冷了些，踱下了慢步，東望西望的，可是尋覓一首詩？我自問：</p>
<p>噢！這裏新開着一家花店我是看見的。</p>
<p>玻璃上有着汽蒸水，顯然，這是溫暖的。</p>
<p>溫暖的花房是蓓芽的溫暖的床呢？流浪的人，你可不會想起你的家嗎？我對於溫房裏一葉一芽都生羨了，雖然它僅祇是微小而又微小啊！</p>
<p>鬰金的顔色是高貴的，她傲然地，豐滿的枝葉擁托着她的笑靨，該是多够迷人呀！常溫的空氣在保護着她。</p>
<p>似乎已經換了一個地方了吧，不則眼前那來這麽紛亂呢？噢！我没有告訴你，我看見了另一朶鬰金了，兩朶三朶……無數朶，她們在顫呢，不，她是跳動了，在迷人的音律中。</p>
<p>該不是什麽夢幻吧，我聽見她們銀箏似的聲音呢？再細細的尋去，的確，她們，非但是她們，那還有一些笑開了心肺的男人的頌讚：「花呀！世界上一切美的東西都在你的眩耀之下羞澀而低頭了」。這語聲似與音樂伴奏着。於是鬰舍帶着她高貴的黄色舞擺着跳上巨人的衣袖了，把她的香灌進那滿生着毛刺的山洞，不，是一因鼻孔，巨人似乎是睡不醒的但是這刻兒已經動了，嘴上笑着，把鬰金拿在掌心。</p>
<p>但是不曾料到，鬰金是會老的，那巨人竟把一朶老了的摔在窗外了。窗外是一聲尖利的呌。但巨人還是揀起了新的鬰金的蓓蕾在笑，他説「有了你，世間的一切美的東西全都减色了。」……</p>
<p>我怎能不驚懼？但不知怎的，前額碰上了冰塊。</p>
<p>頭腦一清，自己還在溫花房的外邊，頭可知已觸着玻璃了，並且還碰出了一點聲音，幸而花房裏没有人，我得跟蹌地走開。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我今年二十六歲，係初中畢業。並在紗廠任職，已有十二年之久。尙未訂婚結婚。現因對家庭不滿，擬脱離家庭，而與某君成立父子關係。惟該事未徵得家長同意，係我個人自動主張，未知能行否？茲有疑點數端，請於最短期内加以解答，爲感。</p>
<p>（一）我原籍係江西，現欲作浙籍人之招子對於法律有妨碍否？</p>
<p>（二）該事係我個人主張而未徵家長及宗族同意，在法律上是否發生效力？事後家長及宗族有追容該事之權否？</p>
<p>（三）宗族對我發生惡感，有將我原籍</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>譜取消之虞否？</p>
<p>敬請　撰安　王師上</p>
<p>編者按：非有絶大之原因，以及絶對不能共同生活之困難，則似無與家庭脱離關係之心要，蓋已同居二十餘年，總較别人能够相諒也。若因偶然發生惡感，以及其他單方面之理由，卽作脱離家庭之行爲，則將來或有後悔及痛苦之一日，此事希望王君加以愼重之考慮。所詢問題，解答於下：</p>
<p>（一）所云「招子」者，想爲養子，於地域絶對無關。</p>
<p>（二）王君旣已成年，在法律範圍内，當然可以自由行動，非任何人所能干涉，更無徵求家長或族人同意之心要。</p>
<p>（三）發生惡感與否，乃人情問題，無關法律。是否取消譜籍，亦無多大問題，因養子關係，一經成立，卽與本宗斷絶關係，何待取消。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Shaoyi cabled the central government on the 18th, reporting that the Zhongshan Incident was entirely due to excessive trust in Lin Shuwei. On the afternoon of the 5th, Lin deployed troops to Tangjiawan, confining Shaoyi to his office and using force, effectively placing him under house arrest. It was not until the afternoon of the 10th that the political council sent a warship to escort Shaoyi out.</p>
<p>How can a country be established? Shaoyi's misjudgment in employing personnel warrants immediate self-impeachment, and he requests that the government earnestly maintain the Zhongshan Model County Act. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Shaoyi cabled the central government on the 18th, impeaching himself, stating that the county troops' mutiny clearly involved attempted organization, undermining the law, and disrupting order. Shaoyi is old and ailing, and his departure is of little consequence. On the 11th, Zun handed over the county seal to Regiment Commander Luo Cequn for concurrent management and properly handled the handover. Realizing his poor judgment in employing personnel and his inability to quell the disturbances, he has failed to live up to the government's commission and the people's expectations. He should immediately impeach himself and request that the government send personnel to investigate, impose strict disciplinary action to maintain order, and earnestly maintain the Zhongshan Model County Act, lest it be revoked due to Shaoyi's dismissal, aggravating his sins.

<h3 id="e8">Finance Ministry Spokesman Denies Abolition of Silver Standard <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Acknowledges Many Misunderstandings from Various Parties at Home and Abroad Regarding the Levy of Export Tax on Silver</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A responsible spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated today that there are many misunderstandings from various parties at home and abroad regarding China's recent levy of export tax on silver. The claim that China has abolished the silver standard is indeed inaccurate. China has always used silver and banknotes as currency. What it is currently facing is only that the connection between silver within China and silver outside China has been severed. Recently, silver prices in London and New York have soared far above exchange rates in Shanghai, and this connection has long been tenuous. Since silver and the foreign exchange rate of Chinese currency are forced to be significantly different from the level of prices in China and world prices, the interruption of this connection is unavoidable. The issue of China balancing international payments has been mentioned repeatedly. The result of an unsound and rising price of Chinese currency has caused this balance to lose its basis. The rise in the price of Chinese currency began when the British pound left the gold standard in September 1931. In December 1931, the Japanese yen also left the gold standard, and in the spring of 1933, the US dollar also began to depreciate. These events occurred one after another, causing a sharp increase in foreign goods imported into China, while China's export trade gradually stagnated. China's competitive position in the export market has thus been greatly affected. To illustrate this with an example, in September 1931, 100 Chinese yuan was worth 4.5 British pounds, 42 Japanese yen, or 21 US dollars. By October 13, 1934, 100 Chinese yuan was worth 7.5 British pounds, 130 Japanese yen, or 37 US dollars. Therefore, it is not surprising that exports are sluggish. It is good to revitalize domestic industries to improve China's international trade position. The government has now entrusted this matter to the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Industry, and many export goods have had their tariffs reduced or exempted, but direct and immediate effects cannot be expected. This is not only because the world's purchasing power for Chinese goods is still very low, but also because of the impact of the annual increase in the price of Chinese currency. China has not been able to smoothly export its goods in the world market. Unchecked outflow of silver will cause Chinese currency to lose a significant portion of its gold. This is why the Chinese government, after careful consideration, resolutely levied silver tax and firmly believes that this measure is a good strategy to cope with the current difficulties. However, the claim that China is considering banning silver exports is indeed unfounded. As for the impact on the financial market, when other countries take similar actions, the market undergoes drastic changes on the first day. In China, there has been no change in two days. The government is not worried about drastic changes in the financial market but is very dissatisfied with speculators spreading rumors. It is also regrettable that some people have suffered heavy losses. The Central Bank will continue to strive to curb excessive fluctuations. The correction of exchange rates is necessary to promote stability. In short, the government's actions were not caused by China itself but were prompted by the currency developments in other countries over the years. (National Telegraph on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese and American governments have exchanged notes on the silver issue. It is learned that when the London Silver Stabilization Agreement was about to be ratified in February of last year, Minister of Finance Kong had informally urged the US government to pay attention to the Chinese government's views on the silver issue. At that time, Minister Kong stated that China had no intention of interfering in the domestic affairs of the United States but was deeply concerned about anything that might affect its financial and international exchange. Minister Kong stated that any action that caused the price of Chinese currency to be higher than other countries' currencies and higher than world prices would inevitably have a monetary contraction effect on China, further impacting its already reduced exports and making it more difficult to purchase goods from abroad. Minister Kong also said that the rise in Chinese exchange rates may lead to a trend of large-scale silver exports, so he already felt uneasy at that time. Now, for the sake of China's major interests, he hopes that all parties, when considering silver issues that may affect China's currency and exchange rates, should consult with China in advance.

<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong Governor Peel issued an important statement today, stating that the Hong Kong government sees no reason to take any special measures on the silver issue. This afternoon, the Governor told the Legislative Council, "I believe there are some uneasy feelings in Hong Kong at present, wondering what steps the Hong Kong government will take after the central government increased the silver tax. I would like to state that the Hong Kong government is closely monitoring this situation, but as of now, there is no special reason to take any measures." (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Yellow River Conservancy Commission opened its meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th. Chairman Li Yishe delivered the opening address, stating that although today is the first day of the third meeting of the Commission, it is a routine meeting for reviewing past work and deciding on future plans, its significance is very important. Most of the resolutions of the previous meeting have been implemented. Some issues involving economic problems have been implemented but have not achieved their goals, which is inevitable during a period of depleted national treasury. The most important task this year is flood prevention. The Commission cannot provide much assistance in terms of materials. As far as the current situation is concerned, it can be said that it is doing its best in terms of personnel. There are many important proposals for this meeting. The most important ones are how to repair the Yellow River dikes, how to assign river defense personnel, and how to make flood prevention measures comprehensive. All experts are requested to discuss in detail so that the Commission can follow. The central government is currently planning to unify water conservancy administration, and we strongly support this and hope it will be successful soon so that water conservancy can make rapid progress.

<p>(Nanjing) Economic expert Liu Zhendong stated that levying an export tax on silver or banning silver exports are both feasible policies to prevent large-scale silver exports.

<h3 id="e32">Encouragement to Mr. Liu Wendao and a Message to the Italian Government Authorities <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Our country's envoy to Italy, Mr. Liu Wendao, was recently approved by the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Committee to be promoted to Ambassador to Italy. It is said that the National Government's explicit order will be announced within days. Among the envoys stationed abroad today, Mr. Yan Huiqing is the only other person to receive the title of Ambassador. His responsibility is extremely heavy, and his position is extremely high. It is deeply hoped that Mr. Liu can uphold the government's entrustment and the people's expectations, and work diligently to resolve various outstanding issues between China and Italy.</p>
<p>We are indeed pleased with the promotion of the envoys of the two countries. However, upon closer examination of the many outstanding issues between China and Italy that have been delayed and unresolved, there is still some regret. How to seek ways to correct and remedy this in the future naturally places a unique responsibility on Mr. Liu, but it is also what the Italian government authorities should facilitate in good faith.</p>
<p>On the eve of Mr. Liu's assumption of the ambassadorship, we dare to state the important outstanding issues between China and Italy to encourage him and to inform the Italian authorities. What are these so-called outstanding issues?</p>
<p>(1) The Delay in the Negotiations on the Extraterritoriality. Italy formally enjoyed extraterritoriality in China, which originated from the Beijing Treaty of the fifth year of Tongzhi (1866). This treaty expired on June 30, 1928. On November 27 of the same year, a new treaty of friendship and commerce between the two countries was established. Article 2 of the new treaty stipulated that the people of one contracting party shall be subject to the laws and courts of the other contracting party in the territory of the other contracting party. However, it was specified in a separate exchange of notes that Italy would not agree to abolish this privilege until all the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty (excluding China) recognized the abolition of extraterritoriality. Of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, Portugal and Belgium have each made arrangements with us regarding this issue. As for the Netherlands' policy towards China, it follows the major powers. Therefore, the substantive meaning of Article 2 of the new Sino-Italian treaty is merely that the abolition of Italian extraterritoriality in China depends solely on the lead of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. Italy is a great power, so why bother to bind itself and reduce its prestige in this way? According to statistics over the years, there are only six or seven hundred Italian nationals in China, and their economic interests are far below those of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. Why bother regarding this extraterritoriality, which is contrary to international norms, as a rare commodity and simply act as a tool for others? Do not the people of Germany and Austria, etc., live and work in peace today without the protection of extraterritoriality, and their feelings towards the Chinese are steadily improving? Then, why would Italy, which cherishes friendship, not do it?</p>
<p>(2) The Existence of the Italian Concession in Tianjin. Tianjin originally had concessions of eight countries, and the Italian concession was only one of them. However, the four concessions of Germany, Austria, Russia, and Belgium have all been recovered by our country one after another. What remains are only the four concessions of Britain, France, Japan, and Italy. The Italian concession was established last, has the smallest area (only 771 acres), and has few residents (only seven or eight thousand people, of which only five or six hundred are foreigners). Why would the Italians be nostalgic for this small piece of land and allow Russia and Belgium to have a monopoly on the former? Furthermore, the sovereignty of the concessions originally belongs to China and must be returned to the original owner sooner or later. Why not take advantage of the promotion of the envoys to immediately open negotiations for the return?</p>
<p>(3) The Retention of the Right of Italian Warships to Berth and Cruise and the Right to Station Troops. The basis for the berthing of Italian warships in China's territorial waters is actually Article 52 of the Beijing Treaty of the fifth year of Tongzhi. Since that treaty has been abolished, it is questionable whether it is legal to continue to enjoy this right according to years of custom. As for the right of Italian troops to be stationed, it is based on the Boxer Protocol. However, the number of permanent troops is only a few dozen, far less than the four countries of Britain, France, Japan, and the United States. The permission of the Boxer Protocol for each country to have the right to station troops was nothing more than because of the extraordinary changes of the Boxer Rebellion "to ensure that the passage from the capital to the sea is not interrupted." Today, the Chinese government and the public have no blind xenophobic ideas, and the troops have long been moved. As for Nanjing, the hub of water and land transportation, it is reasonable to say that each country fundamentally has no need to station troops in North China. Moreover, the number of Italian troops stationed is small, and it is even more of a perfunctory measure. This matter greatly affects China's national prestige, and it is deeply desired that it be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) The Unfulfilled Relocation of the Italian Embassy to Nanjing. Since the Italian government regards China as a great power and raises the level of its embassy, it should establish its embassy in China's capital to implement its initial intention to show goodwill. Now its embassy in China has established an office in Shanghai to facilitate close contact in case of incidents. Why not go a step further and abolish the old embassy in Beiping and directly establish a new embassy in Nanjing? The embassy area in Dongjiaomin Lane in Beiping has long been an abnormal development. Since the capital has been moved south, it is necessary to abolish it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(5) The Pending Conclusion of a Sino-Italian Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. According to Article 3 of the new Sino-Italian treaty of the 17th year, the two contracting parties agreed to negotiate an equal treaty of commerce and navigation in the shortest possible time. However, this has not been realized to this day. We sincerely hope that this treaty of navigation will clearly stipulate the mutual respect for the right of inland navigation. This will not cause any loss to the Italians, but it can be used by our country to break the collusion of the major powers enjoying rights and be beneficial.</p>
<p>In short, if China and Italy sincerely want to seek a path of genuine friendship, they must transcend empty formalities and focus on reality. We welcome the promotion of the envoys of the two countries, and we especially hope that the government authorities can promote the spirit of valuing China to resolve the above-mentioned outstanding issues. Mr. Liu Wendao, who bears the heavy responsibility of negotiation, should be even more encouraged!</p>

<p>Simun Asks About Japan's True Intentions</p>
<p>American Representatives Remain Silent For Now</p>
<p>Formal Anglo-Japanese Talks to Begin Next Tuesday</p>
<p>(London) The talks between the naval representatives of Britain and Japan are scheduled to begin next Tuesday. The British side will be led by Prime Minister MacDonald, with Foreign Secretary Simon and Naval Minister Monsell as representatives. It is reported that the Japanese delegation is demanding a complete overhaul of the current naval system. In order to cope with this demand from Japan, British and American representatives seem to be united in advocating maintaining the status quo and maintaining the naval strength of the major powers within a possible range, striving to be not far from what is stipulated in the current treaty. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Japan wants to hold hegemony in the Pacific, with enough strength to resist the fleets that other countries can jointly send to the Pacific strategically. This is the general view of Londoners on the naval plan pre-agreed upon by Japan's chief representative Yamamoto. According to Yamamoto's remarks to a Reuters interviewer last night, Japan's plan is nothing more than to replace the ratio system of the Washington Convention with total tonnage. Japan also demands equality regarding national security based on this plan. What it calls equality is not necessarily interpreted as tonnage equality. Japan also supports submarines and smaller cruisers but advocates abolishing aircraft carriers. Yamamoto also said that Japan does not welcome the construction of the Singapore base, but is not overly worried. Japan knows that no country can endanger the safety of the British Empire. Yesterday, Yamamoto met with Ambassador Matsudaira for a long time, probably to study in detail the instructions Yamamoto received before the talks began next week. Whether the talks next week will be bilateral or trilateral is still undecided. The British Cabinet met yesterday afternoon and decided to choose a day before the adjournment of the House of Commons around November 16 to hold a special debate on disarmament issues. It is generally expected that there will be no substantial contact between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan this week. American representatives will remain silent. A spokesman said that the United States does not want to change its existing naval position, but since Japan is asking for a larger navy, the United States has come to London to inquire about the reason. It is heard that the American policy has not changed since the discussions were suspended in July. It will still advocate gradually reducing and limiting maritime armaments within the scope of national security. The United States is willing to consider any proposal that moves towards this goal. According to reliable sources, Japan's claim to abolish the 5:5:3 ratio, if it is only a posture of the Japanese to save face, may not be an insurmountable obstacle. It is heard that the point of effort for the United States to join the new talks is to seek a general reduction in tonnage and the establishment of fair relations between the naval forces of the naval countries, so that the fleets of each country are strong enough to protect their own security but cannot be used for aggressive acts. It is generally expected that American representatives will not speak until the end of next week. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Naval discussions are currently being prepared. The first meeting of British and Japanese representatives has been scheduled for October 23. The location will be either at the Foreign Office or at the Prime Minister's residence. The chairman is likely to be Prime Minister MacDonald. Japan's plan to use total tonnage as the basis for limiting armaments was previously discussed in Washington but encountered unavoidable difficulties. The British attitude towards the Japanese plan cannot be known until the entire plan is presented in detail. It is heard that the British attitude is that Britain would like to see the Washington Convention exist or have something similar to the London Convention to replace it. This attitude has been endorsed by the representatives of France and Italy. As for Japan's chief representative Yamamoto's claim that the United Kingdom and the United States enjoy the advantages of the ratio system but are still dissatisfied with the existing treaty, British officials clarified this, saying that both sides must make concessions for this treaty. The American attitude is currently the same as that of Britain, which is to adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the Japanese plan. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) U.S. Navy authority Rear Admiral Huthua praised President Roosevelt's policy of stopping disarmament today. Huthua declared that the president's abandonment of disarmament and replacing it with a naval construction plan, doubling the army, navy, and air force, has made the American people feel restored to safety. Disarmament has been abandoned by other countries. "Once there is trouble in Europe and Asia, the United States will be prepared and can feel safe and cope with it with ease." As for the naval conference, Huthua believed that "the United States has always been a loser, and the hope for future meetings is also dim. If other countries reduce their armaments, the United States is also prepared to make corresponding reductions, but this will not help." (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Remarks by the Japanese Representative <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) Major General Isoroku Yamamoto, the representative of the Japanese government attending the preparatory consultation for naval disarmament, met with a group of newspaper reporters from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan at the Japanese Embassy from 4:30 p.m. on the 17th, and answered questions from British and American reporters. Regarding attending the preparatory consultation, he clarified the Japanese government's position. The meeting lasted about 45 minutes. The situation of the questions and answers is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(Q) What impact does the establishment of "Manchukuo" have on the situation in the Far East and on the issue of disarmament?</p>
<p>(A) Because of the establishment of Manchukuo, the relations in the Far East have become more complicated. Therefore, the Japanese Navy must fully consider this point. However, the "Manchukuo government" itself will not plan to prepare its naval power in the near future.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the reason for abolishing the ratio system?</p>
<p>(A) Establishing differential ratios, the national defense rights of each country are newly bound by the ratio. The Japanese government absolutely opposes this doctrine.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the Japanese government advocate equality of national defense rights or equality of tonnage?</p>
<p>(A) Equality of national defense rights is the fundamental claim of the Japanese government. As for tonnage and other numbers, we intend to discuss them in the preparatory consultation. The British government intends to maintain a majority of cruisers, and the American government insists on its big ship doctrine. The necessary circumstances for national defense are different for each country. Therefore, it is an unreasonable method to determine the ratio with simple numbers.</p>
<p>(Q) What kind of warships does the Japanese government think are necessary?</p>
<p>(A) Although it is inconvenient to discuss this concretely, submarines, etc., are one of them.</p>
<p>(Q) Why advocate abolishing aircraft carriers?</p>
<p>(A) Because I think this is the most fierce attack weapon.</p>
<p>(Q) Then submarines are not weapons of attack?</p>
<p>(A) I think they are definitely not tools for attack.</p>
<p>(Q) After abolishing the naval power ratio, can it be realized by any means without using the means of abolishing the Washington Naval Treaty?</p>
<p>(A) No.</p>
<p>(Q) After the abolition of the treaty, are there preparations to avoid naval arms competition?</p>
<p>(A) Arms competition is originally the misfortune of the people of all countries, so we must do our utmost to avoid it. We are willing to work with the governments of the countries concerned to strive for a satisfactory understanding with a spirit of mutual concession. (17th Japan Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the declaration by Major General Yamamoto, the chief expert of Japan participating in the preliminary naval talks, the British public opinion is becoming more pessimistic about the future of the talks. The Daily Telegraph said that the Washington Treaty stipulates that Britain and the United States should no longer supplement their naval bases in the Pacific. This provision is beneficial to Japan. Now Tokyo wants to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty, and it cannot be without scruples. The reason is this. Although Japan says that if its plan is adopted, no country will feel threatened at sea, why does Japan think that the naval power that it regarded as sufficient to consolidate its national defense in 1921 is not enough to allocate today? Major General Yamamoto has not yet explained this point to this day. As for the issue of total tonnage, it has been discussed in previous naval conferences, and it is generally believed that if this system is adopted, countries will inevitably suspect each other, and the result will inevitably lead to naval arms competition. It is considered inapplicable and abandoned. How can it be raised again this time? In addition, the British side will require all countries to avoid competition in naval aircraft. In Japan and the United States, measures will be taken to circumvent this. The Daily Herald said that the Japanese Ministry of the Navy has set a detailed plan, which can be seen from the declaration of Japan's chief expert, Major General Yamamoto. This plan is to build a large submarine fleet and set up naval bases all along the area from Japan south through Taiwan, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands, so as to form a chain to completely control the Chinese seas and the western Pacific. The Morning Post is more optimistic, believing that Japan's demand for equality may be a theoretical claim, and it is not so firm in practice. The Daily Express published an interview between its reporter and Major General Yamamoto, in which there was a passage: "The reporter asked Yamamoto, can the Washington Treaty be revised without declaring its abolition? Yamamoto replied, I have another appointment, that is, I must go out. Please forgive me." The general impression of the British press can be summarized in these few words. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Russian Telegram Reports Continued Illegal Actions by Japanese Troops</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report in today's Asahi Shimbun, the negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway seem to have encountered major obstacles again. The Asahi Shimbun said that when Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Russian ambassador on October 15, the Russian ambassador proposed that in addition to the railway itself, all other industries of the Chinese Eastern Railway, such as the address of the Russian Consul General in Harbin and other buildings, should be retained by the Soviet Union. The Russian ambassador also said that in the section where two-thirds of the railway price is paid with goods, the Soviet Union can use this money to pay for goods manufactured abroad, and is not limited to those manufactured by the Japanese. The Japanese Foreign Minister was quite surprised to hear this proposal. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Bolibo) Japanese military officers and railway police officers are continuing their illegal activities in the Chinese Eastern Railway area, such as forcibly occupying railway buildings and mistreating railway employees. The Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, Roti, has reported to the board of directors, listing these newly occurring facts, and urging it to quickly take measures to prohibit interference with the normal business of the railway. Mr. Luo also asked the board of directors to pay attention to the outrageous actions of those people who have nothing to do with the railway in the land transferred by the railway, such as the Japanese directing workers at Balingmu Station to build a highway parallel to the railway trunk line without authorization, only 245 meters away from the railway. Also, a certain Japanese construction company has also started construction of a highway towards Punam (transliteration) in the railway area without authorization, only 23 kilometers away from the railway trunk line.

<h3 id="e39">Silver Purchase Plan Fails, US Monetary Policy Moves to the Right <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Congressional Inflationists Will Continue Their Efforts</p>
<p>Government Will Still Proceed with Improving the Monetary System</p>
<p>(Washington) Well-informed sources here indicated today that the government's monetary policy has shifted to the right because the silver purchase plan has failed. However, according to the Associated Press, since the silver purchase policy cannot raise prices, even if there is opposition from the government, the next Congress may re-engage in inflationary activities. The government's adoption of the current plan is actually because this plan is more peaceful than other extreme expansionary policies proposed in the previous Congress. As for the government's attitude towards the inflationary faction, it can be seen in the recent remarks of Secretary of Agriculture Wallace. Wallace declared that manipulating the monetary system can only relieve economic ailments for a while and is of no benefit to agriculture and industry. Interpreters all believe that the Secretary of Agriculture's remarks indicate that the government opposes using currency as a test again, but the policy of improving the monetary system will still proceed. Experts here and in New York believe that the power of the silver policy to raise prices is not as good as Professor Warren's gold plan. Since the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act, the US Treasury Department has purchased 200 million ounces of silver, but the result has been little success. Now it has been implemented for four months, and Treasury officials still claim that the silver purchase plan is still in its initial stages. As for prices, they have increased by only 3% in the four months, while the price of silver itself has soared by 23%. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Daily Telegraph correspondent Reed gave a speech at the Cornhill Club in this city today, expressing his opinion that President Roosevelt has more than enough power to actively compromise with private financial enterprises after the current US election. Roosevelt has reformed the evils of the national financial system with a fearless spirit and fulfilled the demands of the people, so he is more supported by the people. Reed believes that it is also possible for Washington to take action to stabilize its currency again in a shorter period of time. This action will have value for the rest of the world. The degree of America's recovery can be seen in all countries. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The London silver market fell sharply today, with extreme volatility.</p>
<p>Transactions after the official market close were greatly shaken. The spot and futures prices fell by one penny because some traders sold for profit, and speculators were convinced that President Roosevelt would temporarily, but necessarily, reduce the US government's silver purchases, so they sold off in large quantities. With these two reasons, silver prices tended to fall. (17th Telecommunication Dispatch)</p>

These talks are the initial steps for an important conference to be held after the funeral of the late king. The foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries are scheduled to hold a meeting on Friday morning, followed by a meeting of the signatory countries of the Balkan Pact. It has also been learned that before the funeral, members of the Yugoslav royal family will hold a royal family meeting with Romanian King Carol and Queen Marie in the palace this morning. King Carol is related to the late king by marriage and will also meet with French President Lebrun after the meeting to discuss the issue of France restoring its influence in southeastern Europe.

<p>German Ambitions for Eastern Expansion are Ambitious</p>
<p>No Possibility of Understanding Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(Paris) What kind of policy will France adopt in the future? This is a question that all parties urgently want to understand after Barthou's death and Laval's succession as foreign minister. When former Foreign Minister Barthou was killed, he was devoting all his efforts to diplomatic activities, closely cooperating with peace-loving nations, and was also planning to engage in difficult negotiations with Yugoslavia and Italy. Unexpectedly, he sacrificed his life for this. Laval, at this difficult time, succeeds as foreign minister. He once served as foreign minister three years ago and went to Washington and Berlin to personally engage in diplomatic negotiations. Now that he has returned to the position, the general public opinion in Paris believes that France's diplomatic policy will not change. The successive deaths of Southern King Alexander, Foreign Minister Barthou, and former President Poincaré, and the exchange of letters and telegrams between France and its friendly nations, offering condolences, sufficiently prove that the international environment has not changed. Today's Echo de Paris published a diplomatic editorial that is particularly noteworthy. This article was written by the famous reporter Bettina, and his words must have a basis and are undoubtedly reliable. It briefly stated that according to reliable sources, France's diplomatic actions will not change and will strengthen the original policy. Regarding the possibility of a direct understanding between France and Germany, it stated that this kind of attempt is not only hopeless but also not without danger. Hitler's regime has placed Germany in a state of permanent mobilization. Seeking a Franco-German understanding is tantamount to telling the Germans that France's interests only extend to the Rhine River, and that you can act freely in Central and Eastern Europe. This kind of policy is tantamount to placing France in a state of isolation and helplessness, and watching the Hitler Empire annex territories. How can this be reasonable? (18th Havas Telegram)</p>

If I had known that this trip was to assassinate the King of Yugoslavia, I would have eagerly obeyed and not hesitated at all." Bospisić was not touched by the news that he was charged with assisting in the murder. He only said that the terrorist organization would appoint a lawyer to defend him, which he would accept. The preliminary trial judge also summoned Lai Qiqu for questioning. According to his confession, he was born in 1903 in the Croatian region of Yugoslavia and worked as a farmer. He recently resided in the Croatian refugee camp in Yangkashishti, Hungary. The purpose of these refugees is to support Pavelić (a member of the Southern National Assembly and the founder of the Ustaše) in order to separate Croatia from Yugoslavia and establish independence. Regarding the situation and mission of this trip to France, Lai Qiqu's claims are the same as those of Bospisić, with only slight differences in the details. The judge originally intended to have the two confront each other, but this has now been abandoned. The judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for the fugitive beauty Wutrov and Karame (i.e., Kvatelnik, one of the leaders of the terrorist organization). (17th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Opposing the Cabinet's Approval of the Original Plan</p>
<p>The Colonization Agency Obeys the Army's Will</p>
<p>Lüshun: Yesterday, the temporary cabinet, based on the army's claim, approved the original plan decided by the Miao Yi Suo on September 14. The claims of the Kwantung Agency staff were completely sacrificed. As a result of the emergency agreement of the head of the Kwantung Agency, the head decided to resign collectively at 10 p.m. More than 10,000 staff members of the entire agency also decided to follow suit, and the situation became increasingly serious. (17th Communication Telegram)</p>
<p>Lüshun: The Kwantung Agency staff and others who have collectively requested resignation continued to discuss the matter at the agency on the 18th. They all believed that the situation had reached this point and there was no better solution. In the end, the Kwantung Agency staff had to endure and remain silent in fact, so the police and police problem of the reform plan has passed the difficult hurdle. (18th Japan Federation News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the government decided to implement the original reform plan in the cabinet meeting, the Colonization Ministry held a head meeting at 7 p.m. on the 17th. As a result of the agreement, the following policy was decided: (1) The current reform plan is the government's supreme national policy, and we have to obey it. (2) In order to solve the problem satisfactorily, explain the government's opinion to the Kwantung Agency staff and ensure the colonization administration. (3) The Colonization Ministry and Kwantung Agency staff should avoid negative attitudes such as resignation. After the main problem is brought to an end, the Vice-Minister and the Ikom Management Bureau Director will be responsible for the current dispute and resign on their own at an appropriate time. (18th Japan Federation Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada gave earnest instructions to all staff of the Colonization Ministry at the official residence of the Colonization Minister last night regarding the government's decision to implement the reform plan of the organs in Manchuria, hoping that they would all respect themselves. After the instructions were completed, he told reporters that as a last resort, there was no other way but to implement the original plan. In the future, he planned to proceed with all preparations according to the established policy and had obtained the understanding of the cabinet members in the cabinet meeting. Regarding the situation in the field, he planned to do his best to appease them and prevent any unfortunate events from happening. The Colonization Ministry had telegraphed Lingari, the Governor of Kwantung, asking him to work hard to appease them, and it was thought that Army Minister Lin would also adopt the same means. The reform plan was very willing to be implemented as soon as possible, but it was still unclear whether to submit it to a temporary parliament. It was also planned to appoint a full-time Colonization Minister as early as possible, but the time could not be said yet. The Colonization Ministry authorities were enthusiastic about studying the reform plan and continued to make suggestions, for which he was deeply grateful. However, since the government's policy had now been decided, it was hoped that they would all do their jobs. (18th Communication Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Lin opposed Prime Minister Okada's new compromise plan on the reform of the organs in Manchuria at the temporary cabinet meeting, and finally made the original plan pass. Last night, he told reporters that the original plan decided by the Miao Yi meeting on September 14 was passed at today's temporary cabinet meeting, but the Colonization Ministry and the field mistakenly thought that the military police would be realized. In fact, the various police affairs sections of the Police Affairs Bureau manage the personnel of the police, so no military police are used. When the official system is established, it is planned to explain it in detail. The configuration of personnel and the attitude of the military police commander, etc., once clearly determined, will naturally eliminate the fear of military police. In short, from the spirit of the dual system, if the military police, consulates, and Kwantung Agency police are separated and independent, each governing its own way, as is currently the case, the implementation of the national policy towards Manchuria is particularly inappropriate. Considering Kwantung Prefecture and its affiliated territories, its importance will increase in the future, and the result of the command system is deeply felt. Therefore, the original plan is adhered to. The army not only has no intention of dictatorship, but also hopes to proceed with civilian administration. According to the current situation, it is necessary for the development of Manchuria to have only this degree of military action, which is inevitable. I deeply believe that the function of the police organs in Manchuria can be fully exerted by this. Although it is impossible to know how the situation in the field will change, the attitude of the military police in the field will be more cautious in the future. Governor Lingari also pays attention to this point. Due to budget relations, the official system will be promulgated after the temporary parliament. The outline of the official system will be announced first. (18th Communication Telegram)</p>

<p>New York: The factors favorable to the market before the opening of securities trading are: (1) Wall Street's general attention is now focused on the meeting of the Banking Association next Wednesday, at which President Roosevelt will attend and deliver a speech. Merchants hope to learn from this the meaning of the government's monetary policy. (2) Speculators' interest and activity are still lukewarm, but brokers report that some people are slightly buying securities for investment purposes. The unfavorable factor to the market is that although people tend to be inclined towards construction, the upward trend is not thorough and has a stop-and-go effect. This morning, securities trading opened with narrow differences, and price fluctuations were limited, with nothing more than odd numbers. Steel stocks fell more, but even though prices were low, they did not attract significant bullish conclusions. Sentiment is still pleasant, but the market seems likely to remain quiet.

<p>Northwest Inspection Notes by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<h3 id="e96">Recent Situation of Civil Affairs in Gansu Province <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Since the revolution, Gansu has been a place where warlords have been entrenched, levying exorbitant taxes to meet the needs of internal warfare. Coupled with various water and drought disasters and chaotic currency, the rural economy has been in a slump. The people live in dire straits and suffer unspeakable hardship. As for local administrative affairs such as education and construction, in the warlord era, there was only destruction and no construction. The disturbances of Ma Tingxian and Lei Zhongtian, and the ravages of the Northwest Army, caused the people of the whole province to bear tens of millions of yuan in paper money alone. In addition, they had to bear more than 800,000 yuan for military meals every month, and the army levied grain and fodder locally, shortening the lives of more than six million people in the province. Even as recently as the period when Shao Lizi was chairman of the provincial government in the 21st year (of the Republic), local soldiers surrounded the provincial government and forcibly demanded military expenses. In the 22nd year, the provincial government was reorganized, and the central government sent Zhu to take over as chairman of the provincial government and concurrent Pacification Commissioner of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, and dispatched the entire First Division to defend the southern border of Gansu. Thus, the Gansu situation, which required reform in all aspects, began to gradually get on the right track. The recent situation of civil affairs will be briefly described below.</p>
<p>The police administration in this province has been largely unsuccessful in the past. Recently, the Civil Affairs Department, in view of the province's years of disasters and the ravaged state of the local areas, has formulated temporary measures for reducing and retaining public security bureaus in various counties to reduce the burden on the people. Public security bureaus with an annual public security budget of less than 5,000 yuan, or with no budget and relying on temporary levies from the people, will be temporarily abolished and merged into the county government. The public security bureaus to be abolished include 26 counties, including Gangu and Liangdang in Longnan, Heshui and Zhuanglang in Longdong, and Yumen and Dunhuang in Longxi. The remaining 11 counties, such as Wudu, Chengxian, Wenxian, and Kangxian, are close to bandit areas, and their public security bureaus have been reorganized into standing teams of county defense regiments to reduce the burden on the people. As for the director training center for long-term police attached to the provincial public security bureau, because it is an academic institution, it is allowed to extend its time to train police talent.</p>
<p>The establishment of defense regiments in this province also began this year. In the past, the people of various counties, although they provided their own guns and weapons to defend their local areas, lacked training and organization. If the leadership was not appropriate, they often went astray and became a scourge to the local areas. For the sake of local pacification, the Civil Affairs Department first established standing teams of defense regiments in 11 counties, including Wenxian, to create a public force to prepare the villages for self-defense and to prevent bandits from using their cunning skills. The method is for the county magistrate to concurrently serve as the captain of the standing army, with an additional deputy captain to assist. Since the establishment of standing teams in various counties, banditry has gradually subsided and order has been stabilized.</p>
<p>As for self-government, there is little to commend in local self-government in this province. However, recently, each district chief has reorganized the autonomous organizations below the district level with graduates of the training institute for autonomous personnel, and household registration surveys have been carried out in each county in order. However, the autonomous funds in each county are uneven, and the work cannot be carried out uniformly. Regarding the survey items, each county has few detailed and clear reports. In fact, the district and township chiefs are only collectors of money for the county government (or tax collectors). Therefore, it is like climbing a tree to catch a fish to expect the autonomous organs below the district level to be the engine of local public undertakings such as education and hygiene. To promote self-government, it is necessary to first train the people and cultivate their ability to govern themselves. Otherwise, there will only be autonomous organs without autonomous functions, or even let the organs be controlled by local bullies to oppress the people. The people's suffering will deepen, and self-government will be counterproductive. This province is located in a remote border area, with a complex mix of ethnic groups. More than 90% of the villagers are illiterate, and years of disasters have impoverished the local areas to the extreme. Autonomous organs are inherently positive construction, but the public's awareness is weak and their knowledge is backward. They think that the autonomous organs are descendants of the county government, established solely for the purpose of collecting taxes and food, and do not know how to urge themselves to improve. The success of local self-government is still far off.</p>
<p>As for hygiene, this province initially had no hygiene facilities. In addition to the provincial and municipal aspects, where the provincial public security bureau is responsible for the city's hygiene, the county public security bureaus are responsible for the hygiene in various counties. However, the public security bureaus do not have specialized hygiene personnel or hygiene equipment and medicines. Usually, the hygiene work they do is largely limited to cleaning streets and transporting garbage. Although there are clinics attached to the clinics in the summer, they are not necessarily perfect due to limited funds and personnel. Even the review of the qualifications of doctors and the inspection of the sale of medicines in the city are not properly handled. Fortunately, recently, the central government has paid attention to the hygiene undertakings in the northwestern provinces and has established an epidemic prevention office in Lanzhou. According to the person in charge of preparations, the office is divided into two departments: the human medical department and the veterinary department. Each department has several groups, and each group has a director in charge of all the undertakings of the group. The office is currently under construction and will be completed in about five months. Recently, the provincial government has also established the Gansu Provincial Hygiene Inspection Office to work with the epidemic prevention office to handle the province's hygiene undertakings. Animal diseases, seasonal epidemics, and infectious diseases, which have always been considered incurable, will be fundamentally addressed.</p>
<p>As for relief, this province has suffered many major disasters in recent years, and the number of people who have fled is unknown. Therefore, relief undertakings are urgently needed. In addition to issuing orders to various county governments to urge them to follow the regulations on the management of local granaries issued internally, the Civil Affairs Department has also requested the provincial government to approve the allocation of regular funds to establish relief institutions such as relief homes and loan offices in the provincial capital, and to remit tax silver and field grain for disaster victims. Recently, county governments that have violated orders to collect remitted silver and grain from disaster victims have also been investigated and punished by the provincial government.</p>
<p>The quality of officialdom depends on whether or not the right people are appointed. There are those in charge of county administration who can be honest and determined to be good officials, but it is a pity that they are few and far between. As for others, such as those with old and corrupt ideas, or those who are just filling positions and drawing salaries, they are too busy to flatter their superiors, so how can they have time to pay attention to reform and important matters? This situation is almost a common problem in various places. Today, if we want the officialdom to get on track as soon as possible, we must severely urge them on.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Recent News on the Sichuan Army's Bandit Suppression <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Defense of Jialing River Area Consolidated</p>
<p>He and Xiao's Bandit Units Suffer Losses in Guizhou</p>
<p>According to a communication from Hankou, Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression, has repeatedly received telegrams from Chairman Chiang urging him to resume his post and continue to be responsible for bandit suppression. Although there seem to be concerns about the resumption of his post, he has not hesitated to direct military affairs. At the beginning of this month, the various armies, under Liu's command, launched an offensive against the bandits and have made considerable progress. The morale of the troops is very high, and the defense of the Jialing River area is particularly consolidated. Arrangements for the deployment of troops, the relief and emergency aid to refugees, and the promotion of political work are being earnestly planned.</p>
<p>He Long and Xiao Ke's two bandit units originally intended to enter Sichuan at the same time, but they suffered heavy losses due to the suppression by the troops stationed in various provinces, and their goal was ultimately difficult to achieve. He's bandit unit was forced into Guizhou from Ganlongkou in Sichuan, fleeing through Huoshaochang, Xiyangba, Pingdongkou, and Hongshiban. They are now trapped in Yutan. Xiao's bandit unit was surrounded and attacked by the joint forces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, and has been hiding in the mountains. They have repeatedly tried to cross the Zhenyuan River without success and are likely to be wiped out first. The Sichuan Bandit Suppression Headquarters telegraphed Hankou on the 17th to announce the victory, saying, "Xiao's bandit unit fled to Guizhou and, after being encircled and attacked by various armies, has been hiding in the deep mountains in the vicinity of Shiqian, Shibing, and Yuqing. He's bandit unit moved from the border of Sichuan and Hubei to the border of Guizhou and was attacked by a certain division of a certain regiment from Shazichang, and was defeated. The bandits retreated towards Yutan on the 14th, and are currently being pursued and suppressed." (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Completion of the Qingdao Dockyard <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Grand Scale and Novel Machinery</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Jiaozhou is the only good harbor in North China, with a depth exceeding thirty to forty feet and impervious to severe cold. During the German administration, Longma Road was established as a marketplace, and wharves were built, along with the Jiaoji Railway, facilitating convenient land and sea transportation. Commerce flourished, and the once desolate fishing village transformed into a renowned port in the Orient. Subsequently, as the number of ships entering and leaving the port increased daily, a floating dock was specially constructed for repairs, providing convenience to shipping merchants. In the early years of the Republic, with the outbreak of the European War, the Japanese replaced the Germans. Given the proximity of Jiaozhou to Dalian (Lüda), large ships could be conveniently repaired at the Dalian dockyard. Additionally, two small slipways with a capacity of only a few hundred tons were built in the harbor for repairing smaller vessels, while the original floating dock was shipped back to Germany. After Qingdao's recovery, despite the municipal government's utmost efforts, little attention was paid to port affairs for a decade. However, after the appointment of Shen Honglie as the Commander of the Northeast Navy and Mayor of Qingdao, the port of Jiaozhou became the lifeline of Qingdao.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Numerous Chinese and foreign shipping companies operated transport ships, and the number of ships entering and leaving the port reached thousands. Looking across North China, only the Dagukou dockyard was capable of ship repairs, but its scale was small, its equipment simple, and the siltation of the Baihe River was severe. Ships with a draft exceeding ten feet could not enter for repairs, a natural deficiency. As for the Jiangnan shipyards, the distance was too far. Small steamers navigating between Qingdao, Weihai, Qingdao, Yantai, and Qingdao, Haizhou, suffered from the long and perilous voyages and dared not venture there lightly. Even if they did, they incurred both time and economic losses, forcing them to suspend operations, greatly affecting Qingdao. To promote the prosperity of Qingdao and for the convenience of shipping merchants, Shen Honglie raised substantial funds to construct a grand dockyard. In the 21st year of the Republic, the site was selected at Taiping Bay in Xiaogang, and construction commenced, completed in September of this year. The Shanghai Fook Kee Construction Company was the contractor, while the Naval Factory was commissioned to oversee the construction. The dockyard is scheduled to hold its completion ceremony on the 20th of this month. Details of the dockyard are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The bottom and surrounding walls of the dock are entirely hewn from hydraulic rock, with the surface paved with Laoshan granite. The solidity of the foundation and the magnificence of the surface surpass all other dockyards in the country.</p>
<p>The construction of the dockyard, its size and width, must be proportionate. If it is too wide, timber is wasted; if it is too narrow, sunlight cannot easily penetrate, making work inconvenient and paint difficult to dry quickly. The design of the dockyard is based on the latest scientific theories, with suitable size and well-proportioned parts. The width of the dock bottom is fifty feet, gradually widening from the third stone of the dock wall, each level increasing by one foot in height and width, fitting the curved part of the ship's hull. At the eleventh level, the width is thirty inches, facilitating work. From the twelfth layer of stone, every forty-seven inches in height, it extends outward by one foot, totaling five sections and expanding outward by five feet, forming a vertical line to support the ship's sides. The dock gate has two sections: the first extends to the dock head and is four hundred and eighty feet long, and the second extends to the dock head and is three hundred and fifty-six feet long. The water depth above the wooden blocks is thirteen feet. For larger ships, the gate can be moved to the first section; for smaller ships, the gate can be moved to the second section. The water volume is reduced, and expenses are naturally reduced accordingly. On the left, right, and front ends of the dockyard, there are six convenient paths. From the third layer of the stone wall at the bottom, there are thirty-seven steps, each with a height of 1.5 feet and a width ranging from 5 to 7 feet, sloping at about fifty degrees. Multiple workers can ascend and descend simultaneously without feeling crowded, offering convenience and safety comparable to the staircase of a large hotel. At the ends of the dock, there are two slipways equipped with pulleys and winches for transporting materials, proving quite convenient. The center of the dock bottom is slightly higher, sloping to the left and right, with a clear water ditch around the perimeter. Accumulated water drains into the ditch and then flows into the pumping pit, keeping the dock bottom clean and dry. Within the two gates, there are rudder pits for removing and repairing ship rudders. The central wooden keel block on the dock bottom is made of reinforced concrete, with a beam running from the dock head to the dock tail, uniting hundreds of blocks into one, providing greater safety and durability compared to the old-style cast iron blocks. There are also eleven sliding keel blocks on the left and right, laid on iron rails, and four sliding wheel platforms are installed from the dock bottom to the dock surface. When the ship's keel is about to land on the keel blocks, manpower is only needed on the dock surface to move the ropes to the left and right, allowing the sliding wheels to closely adhere to the bottom of the ship, eliminating the need for additional personnel to go underwater to place the keel blocks, a distinctive feature.</p>
<p>In the past, old-fashioned water pumps were all volute type, like the paddle wheels of Yangtze River steamers, with less efficiency. This dockyard uses the latest propeller-type water pumps from the British Vickers factory, similar to the screw propellers of modern ships. The novelty of the design and the magnitude of the effectiveness are unprecedented in Chinese dockyards. There are two machines, each with a 24-inch inlet and a 30-inch outlet, capable of pumping 50,000 gallons of water per minute, approximately 82 tons. The water inside the dock can be drained within three hours, illustrating its great capacity. Each motor is connected to the water pump, rotating at 977 revolutions per minute, with 200 horsepower each. Additionally, there is a separate 7-inch small water pump for temporary drainage of leaks. These machines are all installed in reinforced concrete rooms below ground, occupying very little space and being very easy to manage, another distinctive feature.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Relief-Through-Work Plan in Anhui Province <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Total Funding Required: Four Million Yuan</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: This year, Anhui Province suffered from a severe drought, affecting a vast area. The Anhui Provincial Government drafted a disaster relief plan, ready for implementation. However, due to the Provincial Treasury's financial constraints, it was difficult to implement. Therefore, the scope of the disaster relief work was carefully revised into a relief-through-work plan, submitted to the headquarters of the three provinces' bandit suppression for review and approval. The main points of the plan are as follows: (A) Dredging of Important Rivers. 1. The Wan River and Ji River: Implement relief-through-work dredging of the lower reaches, including (1) the main line of the Wan River, from Yanhekou in the west of Tongcheng, upstream through Jiu Bin Port, Shiku, Shipai, Laoya Tan, Shi Gongdu, Youqi Pu, to Yingjiang Port; (2) the tributary line of the Qian River, from Laoya Tan upstream through Hejia Zha, Xiongjia Bu, and Wangjia He. The total length of the two lines is 195 kilometers. Before detailed on-site measurements and determination of cross-sectional designs, the scope is temporarily set at an average of 12,000 cubic meters of earth excavated per kilometer, totaling 2.34 million cubic meters. Assuming each worker can excavate 0.2 cubic meters per day, this can accommodate 11.7 million workdays, or 13,000 disaster-stricken people for three months. The relief is set at 10 cents per cubic meter, requiring 234,000 yuan. Surveying and engineering management fees will be listed separately. 2. The Zongyang River, Guache River, Dong River, and Chang River: Implement relief-through-work dredging, including (1) the Zongyang River, from the Jiangkou of Zongyang Town upstream through Changhe and Shouyi Lake; (2) the Guache River, from the Yazi Lakekou in the western part of Caizi Lake upstream through Tanglin, Meizhu Ta, and Xin'an Ferry to Lao Meishu Street; (3) the Dong River, from the Tuqiao Huihekou upstream, connecting Shanxi Lake, Chenyang Lake, Baitang Lake, and Zhu Da Lake; (4) the Yan Chang River, from the end of the Zhu Da River upstream through Yangjia Zui, Yan Jia Du, to Jiehekou. The total length is 150 kilometers. Following the Wan River method, it requires excavating 1.8 million cubic meters of earth, accommodating 8,000 disaster-stricken people for three months, requiring 180,000 yuan calculated using the Wan River method. 3. The Yu River: Dredge from the Yu River Estuary upstream through Weijia Town, Tucao Town, Huanglihe Town, Chaoxian County, to the eastern part of Chaohu Lake at Hugangkou. The construction length is 110 kilometers, requiring excavating 1.32 million cubic meters of earth, accommodating over 7,300 disaster-stricken people for three months, requiring 122,000 yuan. 4. The Shishou Waterway in Chaohu Lake: Dredge from Zhongmiao through Shishou to the Hefei County seat, approximately 55 kilometers long. (1) The 20-kilometer section from Zhongmiao to Shishou will be dredged to a depth of 1.5 meters, with a bottom width of 10 meters and a slope of 1:2, requiring approximately 160,000 cubic meters of earth, to be dredged by a dredging machine. (2) The 35-kilometer section from Shishou to Hefei County will be dredged to an average depth of 1.5 meters, with the bottom width narrowed as appropriate, requiring approximately 300,000 cubic meters of earth. Disaster-stricken labor will assist in the first section, while the second section will entirely rely on disaster-stricken labor. Together, this can employ 3,000 disaster-stricken people for more than three months, requiring a total of 142,000 yuan. 5. The Qingyi River, Shuiyang River, and Luming River: (1) The main line of the Qingyi River, from the Wuhu Estuary, through Changhe Xiang, Pujiadian, Qing Shuihe, turning south through Tiancheng Yi and Tai Liangwei and Fangcun Town, Wanzhi Town, to Xihe Town; (2) the first tributary line of the Qingyi River, from Dong Liangshan Jiajiang, through Da Danghe, Jingzhuangmen, connecting to Biandan River to Pujiadian, and east to the main line; (3) the second tributary line of the Qingyi River, taking Yang Qinghe from Qing Shuihe, connecting Erli Geng, and communicating with Shuiyang; (4) the main line of the Shuiyang River, from the Dangtu Jinzhuguan Outer Estuary, along the Gu Xihe River, through Hejiawan, Sanli Tang, Huangchi, Wuxi, Yanchi, to Shuiyang Town; (5) the main line of the Luming River, from the Lugang Estuary, through Yiqiao, Shipao, to Huang Mu Ferry. The above five lines are planned for dredging a total of 330 kilometers, requiring 2.76 million cubic meters of earth to be excavated, accommodating 15,500 disaster-stricken people for four months, requiring 276,000 yuan. 6. The Tanhe River Source: It is proposed that the Huai River Leading Committee and the Anhui Province share the cost, budgeting 300,000 yuan. The above-mentioned dredging portion of item A, totaling approximately 950 kilometers in length, requires an estimated expenditure of 1,264,000 yuan, plus surveying and engineering management fees, estimated at 5% or approximately 66,000 yuan, for a total of 1,330,000 yuan. (B) Dredging of ditches, canals, ponds, and embankments: listed at 520,000 yuan. (C) Repairing of dangerous sections of dikes, culverts, and sluice gates on the Yangtze River, Huai River, lakes, and rivers: temporarily listed at 600,000 yuan. (D) Constructing roads in disaster areas: approximately 650 kilometers are planned, requiring 650,000 yuan. (E) Enhancing disaster prevention equipment: (1) Establishing a Xushui pumping station, requiring approximately 100,000 yuan; (2) Surveying water storage areas, including surveying and hydrological measurements, costing approximately 150,000 yuan; (3) Implementing two major water conservancy development projects: (1) Implementing the Huayang River water-saving project, planned in three phases, requiring a total expenditure of 2,033,000 yuan, with the first phase needing immediate implementation, costing 500,000 yuan; (2) Implementing the Yinli project, requiring 150,000 yuan. The total funding required for the above six items (A, B, C, D, E, and F) is 4,000,000 yuan. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Salt Workers from Twelve Forts Petition the Jiangsu Provincial Government <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Demanding the Preservation of Combined Sailing and Steam Transport and the Abolition of the "Miao Envoy" Measures</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Since last year, when the "Miao Envoy" (referring to a salt transport commissioner surnamed Miao) reformed the salt transport system, abolishing sailing transport and switching entirely to steam transport, the livelihoods of over 200,000 salt workers from the Twelve Forts area were threatened with collapse. At that time, salt workers from the area sent representatives to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, demanding the preservation of combined sailing and steam transport. After repeated discussions between Minister Kong and the Jiangsu Provincial Government representative Wang Boling, a compromise was agreed upon, and an agreement was made on how to negotiate a settlement. The salt worker unrest was then calmed. Recently, however, the "Miao Envoy" Qiu Jie, stubbornly insisted on steam transport and drafted three settlement measures: "Hemp Bag Factory," "Immigration for Employment," and "Subsidized Vessel Conversion," submitting them to the ministry for record. Recently, he has been actively implementing these measures, sending a certain Ma to Twelve Forts to purchase salt vessels for factory conversion and ordering the Seven Companies to relocate north. The salt workers have become greatly alarmed and have once again sent over 4,000 representatives to the provincial capital to petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in the Provincial Capital: The total number of boat owners and salt workers in the Twelve Forts area is no less than ten thousand. After holding meetings, each boat sent two representatives, and the transport workers also sent some representatives, totaling over 4,000 people, led by the chief representatives Yang Huaisheng, Yang Desheng, Wang Mingyi, Xu Jinyuan, and Zhu Zhaoluan. At dawn on the 17th, they chartered three tugboats, towing dozens of civilian boats, carrying over a thousand petitioners from the fort to Zhenjiang. They arrived at around 10 a.m., disembarked, and headed to the provincial government to petition. In the afternoon, a second group of over 700 people arrived, with the entire crowd gathered on the road to the provincial government, causing congestion.</p>
<p>The Petitioning Process: After the salt workers arrived at their destination, the five representatives, including Zhu Zhaoluan, presented their cards to request a meeting with Chairman Chen. As Chen was in Beijing on official business, the section chief, Wan Junmo, met with them in his place. The representatives stated that the "Miao Envoy" had overturned the combined sailing and steam transport measures, ordered the Seven Companies to relocate north, and drafted measures to establish factories, relocate for employment, and subsidize vessel conversion, destroying the means of livelihood that the salt workers had depended on for generations and cutting off their means of survival. They requested that the central ministries be informed and that the salt workers' demands be accommodated: (1) abolish the three measures of the "Miao Envoy" and withdraw their record filing; (2) preserve sailing transport; (3) revoke the order for the Seven Companies to relocate north. Wan promised to forward the request to Chairman Chen upon his return to Zhenjiang and also promised to telegraph Wang Weiyuan to come to Zhenjiang to discuss solutions, and he advised the representatives to return first to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>Sleeping in the Open: The representatives, feeling that their demands had not been fully resolved, decided to gather and wait outside the provincial government until Chairman Chen returned to Zhenjiang to resolve the issue. As night fell, most of them brought rice straw mats and bedding, huddling together in the cold wind, their situation extremely miserable. However, their firm determination was not diminished by this suffering. It is said that there are still over a thousand people who, because the ships were loaded yesterday, are scheduled to come to Zhenjiang today to join the petition.</p>
<p>Military and Police Maintaining Order: After receiving news of the salt workers' petition in Zhenjiang, the provincial capital's Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to monitor the scene, prohibiting smoking and lighting fires to prevent fires. The Special Operations Battalion of the Security Department also sent troops armed with rifles to maintain order. Fortunately, the petitioning salt workers were able to obey the command and maintain order, so there was no opportunity for troublemakers to take advantage of the situation. According to the representatives, if they do not receive a satisfactory response from the provincial government, they plan to go to Beijing to petition Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance.

<p>Sun Lanqin, a villager from He Ying in the 14th district of Fengjing, was in his fifties. His wife, surnamed Ma, was of a similar age. They were tenants at Fei's residence in Zhenxi. Lanqin and his son, Songpo, cultivated the land at home, and the family lived harmoniously. On the 16th of this month, the father and son were at home. The next day, at around 10 a.m., his nephew, Langan, was passing through the fields when he saw his uncle Lanqin lying dead in the fields, covered in blood. Realizing that something had happened, he ran to inform his aunt, Ma. Upon returning to the village and seeing the scene, Ma was extremely grieved and immediately reported it to the Second Branch Bureau, which forwarded it to the County Public Security Bureau to request the court to conduct an autopsy. The cause of Sun Lanqin's death is unknown. However, since Lanqin's death, his son, Songpo, has suddenly disappeared, leading local people to speculate.</p>

<p>Following the county magistrate's decision to merge townships in the first district of this county, it was imperative to re-select township chiefs and deputies. After being selected, a list was submitted to the county magistrate for approval to facilitate the handling of baojia (local security system) matters. The district chief, Li Yi, followed orders to compile a register of candidates for township chiefs and deputies for the 20th year of the Republic. The county has now approved the list and issued instructions, informing the selected township chiefs and deputies and reporting the date of their appointment for approval. Among the town chiefs in this district, only the Longtan Town chief was replaced by Huang Han, while the rest were re-appointed to their original positions.</p>
<h3 id="e103">New Developments in the Suzhou Land Tax Fraud Case <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The land tax fraud case in Wuxian, which has caused a sensation in society, has been under investigation by two commissioners, Dong and Fang, dispatched by the Ministry of Finance to Suzhou. Initially, they uncovered fraudulent activities in the private collection of taxes, arresting the register manager, Qian Zhonghua, and detaining him at the County Security Team headquarters to await further action. Subsequently, after a detailed investigation into the hidden wasteland section for a month, they discovered that old, long-term wasteland registers had been falsified by underreporting the amount of taxable land. On the night of the 17th, Commissioner Dong, together with Section Chief Dong of the county government, searched the residence of the land tax collection director, Zhu Xijun. After consulting with the Wuxian county magistrate, the county magistrate ordered the removal of Zhu Xijun from his position as director of the land tax collection office, pending investigation, and appointed the deputy director, Gu Xiangji, as the new director, and appointed a Lin to be the new deputy director. Zhu Xijun was summoned to the county government and temporarily placed under surveillance, awaiting provincial orders. Commissioner Dong took a train to the province yesterday (the 18th) to seek instructions. It is reported that the old register, Wu Taijing, and the register room managers, clerks, and surveyors of the five districts are all suspected of colluding in the fraud. The Wuxian county magistrate summoned all the staff of the land tax collection office yesterday morning (the 18th) and stated that the responsibility for the land tax fraud case rests solely with Director Zhu and will not involve others, so all staff can continue to work in peace. The new director, Gu Xiangqing, took office yesterday (the 18th) and is in the process of taking over. Whether the case will be transferred to the province or to the court for handling remains to be determined by provincial orders. However, the contents of the case are very complex and are unlikely to be resolved within a few days.</p>

<p>Gentry, merchants, and villagers of Sandun Town in Nanhui County raised funds to build a Fire Prevention Association in the Yangshe Temple in the town's Chayang community to prevent disasters. The association was established on National Day. On the 13th, villagers Pan Gentang, Pan Molin, and others gathered several hundred people to the town, falsely claiming that the Fire Prevention Association had encroached on the site of the Yangshe Temple and had to be destroyed. The town chief reported the matter to the district office. The district chief, Zhang Bangjie, went to the town to mediate, but to no avail. The walls and roof of the Fire Prevention Association's premises were destroyed, and the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p>The fresh meat business in the urban area of this county has been in dispute with the slaughter tax office over tax collection. Four meat shop workers were detained, leading to a strike by the entire industry and petitions to party and government authorities, as reported yesterday. It is now learned that the industry, after being persuaded by County Magistrate Yan and the County Chamber of Commerce to resume business, is quietly waiting for a resolution. The detained shop workers, Li Bingsheng and Guo Zhiyuan, and two others, were released by County Magistrate Yan after ordering the Public Security Bureau to transfer them to the County Government for interrogation. The County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of meat industry representatives Sui Zongyi, Wei Shuzhou, Ren Shuji, Wang Zhongxian, Li Chengde, and others at 10 a.m. yesterday (the 18th). Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yang Hanxi, Chen Zhanru, Cheng Jingtang, and others successively persuaded the representatives. However, the discussion on spot tax collection ended without any benefit to the meat merchants. They insisted on mediation according to the previous agreement to increase the tax by five yuan, but the tax office claimed that the spot tax collection had resulted in losses of approximately 2,000 yuan, which should be compensated by the meat merchants. The meat merchants refused, and the mediation ended without any result.</p>

<p>The Zhenjiang Branch of the Customs Office, after being requested by the County Chamber of Commerce and others and approved by the Revenue Department, has been changed to a loading and unloading port for scheduled ships. Local figures such as Ji Xiangxiang, to promote the local economy, planned to build lighters and warehouses. However, due to limited local financial resources, they contacted the Shanghai Commercial Bank for investment and visited various ports along the Yangtze River for investigation. The Shanghai Bank is currently planning the investment. However, the key point of whether or not to invest is whether Huangtiangang Port will be dredged this winter, which is a major issue. The party and government held a meeting at the county government on the 16th to discuss the development plan and submitted it to the provincial department for review and approval of subsidies so that construction could begin as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This year, Wuyi suffered from a severe drought, and before the winter season arrived, burglaries have already occurred frequently in the four townships. At around 1 a.m. on the 17th, a group of armed bandits suddenly came to the home of Yang Xianquan in Zhongyin Township, in the first district. While they were firing shots to intimidate, a security guard who was patrolling nearby heard the gunshots and immediately went forward to apprehend them. He captured one bandit, Chen Suo'er. He was then transferred to the first substation of the Public Security Bureau in the West Gate. After being questioned by the patrol officer, Tang Renjie, he learned the whereabouts of his accomplices and immediately dispatched police to the city wall of the South Gate, capturing two bandits, Shao Jiannan and Qiu Xiaojing. He then captured two suspects, Shi Hebao and Zhang Guiqing, under the East Gate water gate. After repeated questioning, they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. On the previous day, the home of Zhou A'gen in Gouzhuang Township in the sixth district was also robbed. Dozens of bandits came and searched the house at will, taking away all of his 1,630 yuan in silver dollars and all of his clothes. The loss was extremely great.

<p>Various circles in Yangzhou have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities regarding the Jinan Seven Companies relocation issue, but without resolution. When the Miao Transport Envoy came to Yangzhou on the 16th, representatives from various circles went to petition him, but they were suppressed and dispersed by armed tax police, causing public outrage. The entire city went on strike, classes were boycotted, and work was stopped. Automobiles and ships were all suspended, and transportation was cut off. Students from various middle schools gathered to parade and demonstrate, and the atmosphere was unusually tense. Realizing the seriousness of the situation outside, Miao went to see Councilor Wang on the morning of the 17th and talked for three hours. After Wang repeatedly enlightened him, Miao deeply agreed with what Wang said and realized that he had been lacking in his own observations. He immediately signed a solution and met with representatives from various circles, voluntarily agreeing not to relocate the companies to the north. As a result, all parties were satisfied. In addition to the automobiles and ships resuming their schedules in the afternoon, all schools and shops resumed classes and business on the 18th. The salt crisis is expected to subside.</p>

<p>Gao Jinhua Silk Shop in Jiaxing was a sole proprietorship established by Gao Zhonglan. It has been in business for over twenty years and has a good reputation in the business community. After the completion of the Jima Road in the North City, the shop purchased land and built a tall, foreign-style building there to expand its business. During the autumn sales of silk and cloth, the shop also occupied a favorable position in the business. However, after the Ziyuanzhuang and other three money shops declared liquidation and the Jiaxing Bank suspended payments, the shop was also affected by withdrawals from depositors. Although manager Chen Yongnian tried to maintain the business, it was difficult to manage. Therefore, the shop announced its closure on the 18th. However, it is said that the shop has not withdrawn most of the deposits from its depositors, and it also owes a considerable amount of money to creditors, totaling approximately 200,000 yuan. Therefore, it may be difficult to liquidate the shop.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemi Long continued to say that they stayed in Beiping for six days, visiting scenic spots. The ancient capital has an antique flavor and the scenery is quiet, elegant and magnificent, which makes people reluctant to leave. They were deeply grateful for the sincere hospitality of the Peiping authorities. It was also very pleasant to meet with celebrities such as Wang Zhengting, Ding Wenjiang, and Hu Shi. Dr. Wang Zhengting traveled south with them in the same car, and they talked about everything along the way, which was not lonely at all. They are scheduled to board the Ryuta Maru tomorrow night (i.e. tonight) and return to China via Japan, etc.</p>

<p>Published Yesterday by the International Trade Bureau</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, China's foreign trade was still sluggish in the first and second quarters of this year. Both exports and imports were lower than in previous years. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, yesterday and received the trade statistics for the first half of the year from the bureau, which showed that imports decreased by 26% and exports decreased by 9%. A summary is provided below.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Document from the National Trade Bureau to the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau reported on the trade situation in the first half of this year and submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, which read: "We would like to report that the trade situation in 1932 and 1933 has been reported in installments. The first and second quarters of this year have passed in a flash. During this period, China's foreign trade was still sluggish, and both imports and exports were lower than in the same period last year. Imports decreased by 26% and exports decreased by 9%. The degree of decline in imports was greater than that in exports, which is somewhat gratifying. As for trade commodities, in terms of exports, China's main commodities, such as raw silk, egg products, and tea, have seen a significant decline in foreign sales. Cotton goods and cotton yarn have also been lower than in previous years. Only furs, leather, wool, coal, and animal skins have been slightly active. It is evident that domestic production has not seen any recent development. In terms of imports, there is something gratifying, that is, the import of agricultural products and rice has suddenly shown a very sharp decline. Other main commodities, such as cotton cloth, kerosene, coal, paper, chemical products, sugar, ammonium sulfate, rayon, fish and shellfish, and seafood, have all decreased compared with the same period last year. Only the import figures for machinery and hardware have suddenly increased, which may be a sign that domestic industrial construction is gradually becoming concrete. Overall, the trade situation in the first and second quarters of this year is still declining, but the deficit in the two quarters has decreased by more than 170 million yuan compared with the same period last year due to the sharp decrease in imports. If the domestic situation can move towards a stable and well-off state in the future, it will not be difficult for industry and commerce to achieve prosperity together, and foreign trade may tend to be balanced. At the end of the first and second quarters of trade, we report on the situation. Please review and approve. Sincerely presented to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e126">International Economy Slightly Stabilizes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The world economic panic, which began in 1929, has become increasingly severe. Until last year, due to the efforts of governments to seek relief, there were signs of improvement. In the first half of this year, the economies of various countries continued to move towards recovery. Although the progress was slightly slower due to the dangerous international political situation, the finances of various countries have improved compared to before, currencies have not entered a state of fierce war, and finance has been slightly stable. Industry and trade have seen significant increases. On the surface, the situation this year is more optimistic than last year. However, we must know that the panic policies currently implemented by various countries all contain inherent contradictions and are not enough to make the world's production and consumption match. Today's economic recovery is actually limited to the domestic affairs of various countries, and mostly occurs in countries that devalue their currencies. In these countries, workers have not initially received the benefits of recovery, and the actual wages earned are very low. Agriculture and the purchasing power of the people are declining and suffering even more losses. The public works programs carried out by the government have had little effect. In addition, the trade policies of various countries are quite conflicting, and the obstacles to world trade have not been reduced at all. Therefore, a true world economic recovery is not easy to talk about at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Domestic Economy Declines Day by Day <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>In the first half of this year, although the economies of various countries showed signs of recovery, China's domestic economy remained the same as before, without any progress. Agricultural production is expected to be poor this year due to the drought in June. Industry has made little progress due to the weak purchasing power of the people and the influx of foreign goods. Finance is still in a state of imbalance. In addition, due to the upcoming implementation of American silver purchases, silver is flowing out of the country. In recent years, cash in China has been flowing from the interior to central cities, and now it is flowing from cities to foreign countries. If this continues, the national economy will inevitably suffer a major breakdown. Although there are one or two optimistic phenomena in other domestic finance, transportation, and shipping, overall, China's domestic economy this year is still in a state of recession.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Foreign Trade Becomes More Exhausted <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>This year, the world economy is still declining, the domestic economy is also in recession, and foreign trade is still in a state of slump, which goes without saying. In terms of total trade volume, the first quarter was 416,572,749 yuan, and the second quarter increased slightly to 421,821,801 yuan. If we analyze the export trade, both import and export figures were highest in January. On the export side, the net export value in January was 50,775,783 yuan. In February, the value of exports decreased sharply due to the fact that the old lunar new year period has historically been a slow month, with just over 38,350,000 yuan. In March and April, it increased slightly to around 41 million yuan. In May and June, it rose to more than 49 million yuan, but it still did not break the highest export figure in January in the first half of the year. Comparing the export figures for the first and second quarters, the second quarter was stronger. The total export value in the first quarter was 128.92 million yuan, while the second quarter reached 140.61 million yuan. On the import side, the net import value in January was 105.46 million yuan, 82.75 million yuan in February, and 99.42 million yuan in March. The total import value in the first quarter was more than 287.64 million yuan. The import value in April increased relatively, reaching 100.96 million yuan. The import value in May and June trended downward again, with 94.98 million yuan in May and 86.25 million yuan in June. The total import value in the second quarter was 282.2 million yuan, which was slightly lower than the import value in the first quarter by 5.44 million yuan. The total export value in the first half of this year was 269.54 million yuan, the import value was 569.84 million yuan, and the total foreign trade volume was 838.39 million yuan. The deficit in the first half of the year totaled 301.305 million yuan, a decrease of 173.33 million yuan compared to the deficit in the same period last year.</p>

<p>Drought: 133,803,000 Mu</p>
<p>Floods: Totaling 31,025,000 Mu</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the floods and droughts in various places this year have caused widespread disasters, which is an unprecedented catastrophe. According to the telegrams and letters reporting the disaster situation from various parties, the Shanghai Drought Relief Association yesterday compiled the following statistics on the affected farmland: drought disasters in 11 provinces, affecting 133,803,000 mu of farmland; flood disasters in 14 provinces, affecting 31,025,000 mu of farmland. The proportion of disasters in each province is as follows: Zhejiang Province 57%, Jiangxi Province 52%, Anhui Province 48%, Hunan Province 36%, Hubei Province 10%. This is enough to prove the severity of the disasters in various provinces this year. We hope that compatriots will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance and enthusiastically donate to save this catastrophe, so as to cultivate the nation's vitality.</p>

<p>Continuing Negotiations on the Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, French Minister to China Weilitun returned to his country on leave and reported to the French government on the situation in China. His vacation is now over. According to French sources yesterday, Weilitun will depart from Marseille to return to his post. The date of arrival in Shanghai is expected to be around the 10th of next month. It is also learned that after the French Minister returns to his post, he will continue to negotiate with the Chinese diplomatic authorities on the signing of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. The negotiation of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty has been repeatedly discussed by Minister Weilitun and the Chinese diplomatic authorities, and most of the issues have been resolved. However, the annex part remains to be further negotiated. Therefore, during his return to his country, the French Minister asked the French government for instructions on solutions. It is predicted that the commercial treaty can be completely resolved and signed after Minister Weilitun returns to his post.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Appeal from the Yarn Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Telegram Was Sent to the Executive Yuan and Ministries to Request a Revision of the Tariff</p>
<p>An Emergency Meeting Will Be Held Again on a Scheduled Date</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association believes that the Ministry of Finance's plan to increase the unified tax on cotton yarn is of great importance to the future of the yarn industry. Therefore, it held a meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday afternoon and passed a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Cotton Control Committee. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Emergency General Meeting to Be Held on a Scheduled Date <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The association held a meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday afternoon to conduct a detailed discussion. It was generally believed that the decline of the yarn industry has reached its extreme and cannot bear any further burdens. A general meeting should be convened to jointly discuss rescue methods. Therefore, it was decided to convene a national emergency general meeting of the Chinese yarn factory industry in Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. on the 28th of this month. The association has notified all Chinese yarn factories across the country to send representatives to participate in the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Tariff Revision Should Be Divided into Four Levels <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Mill Association sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministries, which read: "Greetings to President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and Chairman Chen of the Shanghai Cotton Control Committee. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has suddenly proposed an increase in the unified tax on cotton yarn. Rumors are spreading, and the public is panicked. Since the implementation of the unified tax in our country's cotton textile industry, Chinese factories have suffered serious blows due to the poor tax rate levels. Recently, the situation has become even more precarious due to increased taxes on imported cotton and reduced taxes on cotton products. If the proposed tax increase is borne by consumers and has nothing to do with manufacturers, this statement may still be valid when rural areas are stable and sales are booming. However, in recent years, droughts and floods have occurred one after another, and rural areas have gone bankrupt. People are selling at a loss in order to seek a profit, and users are still unable to afford it. If prices are increased again, no one will be interested. The newly added tax is equivalent to increasing the burden on the factory and increasing losses. When manufacturers' losses deepen, they will inevitably be closed down. The income from the unified tax will disappear accordingly. Trying to alleviate an urgent need by sacrificing something essential will not solve the problem. Even if the government increases taxes in order to enrich the national treasury, it should follow the principles of taxation, seek a balance in burdens, and increase those that should be increased and reduce those that should still be reduced. For example, 4-count cotton yarn, which sells for about 100 yuan, is classified in the same level as 20-count cotton yarn, which sells for 170-180 yuan, and is subject to a heavy tax of 8 yuan and 58 cents. 60-count fine yarn, which is worth more than 400 yuan, is classified in the same level as 32-count fine yarn, which is worth 230-240 yuan, and is subject to a light tax of 11 yuan and 63 cents. The imbalance in the burden is so great. Chinese factories, which mostly spin coarse yarn, have suffered enormous losses. In recent years, factories have been declining day by day and eventually collapsing. The poor tax system is one of the main reasons for this. If we can take this opportunity to change the tariff to the four-level system of customs, reduce those that should be reduced and increase those that should be increased, factories will dare not disobey. If we still increase taxes according to the original two-level system, it is tantamount to fearing that Chinese factories will not perish quickly and encouraging them to perish together. We have always known that you are maintaining the industry with the utmost care. We earnestly ask you to consider the imminent danger of the factory industry, which is like a thread about to break. Please exempt cotton yarn from being increased, or differentiate between heavy and light and change the level of taxation, so as to prolong the life of the national factory. We are extremely eager to await your orders. The Chinese Yarn Mill Association respectfully asks."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Telegram from Tianjin Yarn Industry Appealing for Help <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Yarn Mill Industry Association,</p>
<p>Telegraphs: To Minister of Finance of Nanjing, Commissioner of Shanghai Customs, and Chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee: We have received a letter from the Chinese Yarn Mill Association stating that we have been verbally informed by the Commissioner of Customs that it is planned to increase the cotton yarn consolidated tax from November 1st. Upon hearing this, we were extremely shocked. The yarn industry has been in decline in recent years, reaching its lowest point, especially for yarn mills in Hebei and Tianjin. The existing yarn machines in Hebei can mostly only spin coarse yarn, and the woven products from coarse yarn can only be sold to farmers in rural areas and cannot be sold in large quantities in cities. Since the bankruptcy of rural areas in Hebei, the purchasing power is weak, and the sales of cotton yarn have been extremely scarce. Furthermore, due to the drastic changes in the East Provinces, a major sales market has been lost. As a result, the price of yarn has fallen drastically. The price obtained per bale is only enough to cover the cost of cotton and taxes, leaving no money for wages. If this loss continues to worsen and difficulties increase, even if the tax is not increased temporarily, the mills are already in imminent danger, and some mills have already reported shutdowns and cannot resume work. How can they bear the additional burden? Wouldn't they all close down one after another? If the yarn mills cease to exist, where will the yarn tax come from? If the source of tax revenue is lost, what is the benefit of increasing taxes? If it is said that the increased tax can be indirectly passed on to the users, we believe that this argument may be valid when sales are extremely strong. However, now that prices are being lowered to seek sales, users are still struggling to afford it. Where is there room for price increases? In addition to the Chinese Yarn Mill Association exhaustively stating the situation of factories nationwide, we would like to further explain the advantages and disadvantages of the situation in Hebei in detail. We humbly request that you consider the market conditions, continue to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses, cancel the previous proposal, and extend the lifeline of yarn mills. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Tianjin Yarn Mill Industry Association.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Great China Rubber Factory Resolved to Resume Work Today <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Unanimous Resolution Passed at Yesterday's Board of Directors Meeting</p>
<p>And Relief for Innocent Workers Affected</p>
<p>According to the Industry News Agency, the Great China Rubber Factory has been experiencing labor unrest since the 4th of this month, lasting for half a month. The factory has repeatedly received earnest mediation from party and government agencies and various domestic goods organizations. A special emergency meeting of the board of directors was convened at the office at 2 PM yesterday, attended by Yu Zhiqin, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Shi Gengyin, Wu Zhesheng, Xue Fuji, Yuchi Xunzhi, Yu Xingben, Zhu Huiren, Jiang Binxian, Yu Jieru, Hong Nianzu, and others, totaling more than 20 people. Manager Xue Fuji first reported that recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Domestic Goods Factories, the Shanghai Machine Federation, the China National Products Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting Domestic Products, and the Rubber Products Association of Domestic Goods have forwarded instructions from the Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs, urging the company to resume work as soon as possible to maintain the livelihoods of the majority of innocent workers, demonstrating the government and society's utmost concern for the industry. Moreover, more than 1,300 innocent workers at the factory jointly pleaded for an early resumption of work and requested relief during the suspension of work. All the directors and supervisors present unanimously passed the following resolutions: (1) Comply with the Bureau of Social Affairs' urging and resume work first to maintain the livelihoods of innocent workers. (2) Those who were arrested for violent acts have been punished by the court according to law, and those who have fled and have not been apprehended should be dismissed immediately. (3) Workers who participated in disruptive behavior before and after the event should be listed separately and reported to party and government agencies for dismissal according to law. (4) During this factory riot, more than 1,300 innocent workers who were paid by piecework were innocently implicated and are deserving of sympathy. Based on the requests from the inspectors and foremen of various departments for relief, permission is granted to provide appropriate subsidies. (5) Whether paid by monthly salary or piecework, contracts must be signed to ensure compliance. The company immediately reported to the Bureau of Social Affairs and scheduled to resume work today (the 19th) and requested that personnel be dispatched to supervise the process. The labor-management disputes of the past half-month have thus come to an end. It is reported that the factory suffered tangible losses of more than 20,000 yuan, while intangible losses are still being calculated.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Establishment of the Stabilization Committee Will Still Require a Considerable Amount of Time <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Minister Kong Called Banking Leaders for Talks</p>
<p>Authorities Should Strictly Prevent Private Smuggling of Silver</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, now that an export tax has been levied on silver, the authorities are discussing the second step with the banking community to organize a silver price stabilization committee. Yesterday afternoon, Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Zhang Gongquan of the China Bank, Li Fusun of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Chen Guangfu of the Shanghai Bank, Song Zi Liang of the China Construction Silver Company, and others gathered at the Central Bank to talk with Minister of Finance and President of the Central Bank Kong Xiangxi and Vice President Chen Xing for about an hour before dispersing. Although the authorities denied that the talks were about the silver tax issue, it is generally expected that they were related to stabilizing the price of silver. According to another banking source, the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the silver export tax has aroused panic in various markets. Not only have the gold and securities markets risen steadily in recent days, but the flour and yarn markets have also risen sharply. Therefore, the establishment of a stabilization committee is imperative today. The content of Minister Kong's talks today is still unknown. Although foreign exchange is now listed by the Central Bank, foreign banks may still have problems with exchange rates in the future. At that time, the stabilization committee can be responsible for resolving these problems. Therefore, the establishment of this committee is like adding a buffer between foreign banks and the Central Bank, making everything easier to negotiate.</p>
<p>As for the committee's domestic mission, the greatest is to suppress and stabilize the price of silver in the domestic market. If the price of gold in the gold market is seen to be high, the committee will definitely take the method of selling it to suppress it. If the price is seen to be low, it will definitely buy it to raise it. With this key, the stabilization committee must have a strong fund. Without a fund of four to five hundred million, it cannot be used for circulation. Now that such a large fund is handled by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, it is really difficult to bear. Therefore, although the stabilization committee is desired, the date of its establishment may still require a considerable amount of time. Furthermore, because silver has been taxed for export, due to the increase in silver tax, there will definitely be more people who smuggle and evade taxes. This is something that must be paid attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e139">"Kneeling and Crying Group" Discovered in Shanghai Amid the Dumping of Foreign Goods <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Specially Persuading Chinese People Not to Buy Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Aiming to Love the Country, Seeking Nothing Else</p>
<p>According to the Industrial News Agency, since foreign goods have been dumped in the interior of our country, our industry and commerce have plummeted, and economic panic has reached its extreme. However, the so-called modern men and women youths in cities all regard the use of foreign goods as fashionable, to the extent that they are not modern without wearing foreign goods. As a result, the sales of domestic goods have plummeted. In the past, patriotic people had organizations like the "Assassination Group," but their actions interfered with the law, so they were soon banned by the authorities. Recently, a "Kneeling and Crying Group" has suddenly been discovered in this city. Its members are only a few people who specialize in wandering on the road. When they see Chinese people buying foreign goods, they immediately step forward, kneel down, and plead to use domestic goods to save the country from danger. The reporter witnessed members of this "Kneeling and Crying Group" kneeling and pleading with a young girl on Fada Road, asking her not to buy foreign goods. When the reporter stepped forward to inquire about their names, they refused to answer and only said that they were aiming to love the country, promote domestic goods, and were seeking nothing else.</p>

<p>To Determine Whether the Amount Meets the Regulations Before Reissuing Licenses</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation presented a petition to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government in Nanjing, Shanghai's banks are numerous, and most have joined the Shanghai Banking Association as members. Those who have not joined the Banking Association are because they are newly established or their credit has not been established. However, there are countless banks in similar situations, which is detrimental to the financial market. Once an accident occurs, it will inevitably affect the center of commerce. Therefore, for all promissory notes used, a guarantee deposit should be stored in the Ministry of Finance to verify the authenticity. Recently, the banks that have gone bankrupt in Shanghai include the Ri Ye Bank, the Wu Hua Bank, and the China Xingye Bank, all of which are not members of the banking industry association, so their promissory notes have no guarantee, which is extremely harmful to society and disrupts the financial market. Our association cannot remain silent for the sake of maintaining commerce. We should ask the Ministry to thoroughly investigate the capital of the banks, and all promissory notes issued must store cash collateral to avoid abuses and protect a portion of credit. For newly established banks, we hope the Ministry will conduct a thorough examination to ensure that the amount of capital is consistent before issuing licenses to stabilize the financial market. We sincerely request that the Ministry approve and implement this for the public convenience.</p>

<p>Judging of Exhibits Today</p>
<p>The National Child Welfare Leaders Conference held its general assembly in Shanghai this time. Leaders of child welfare undertakings from all over the country came to Shanghai to attend, opening a new era in China's child welfare field. The grand occasion of the past few days has been recorded in previous reports. The China Wireless Electric Research Society specially installed a sound amplification machine in the grand auditorium of the New Asia Hotel, which was especially convenient for the general assembly's speeches and the statements of various representatives. Bingxun Shorthand School sent many students to serve as recorders for the general assembly. All the speeches from all parties were recorded in detail. Wang Kai Photography Studio also volunteered to take photographs, and detailed materials will be available for future compilation of reports. As for the general assembly declaration, after the general assembly approved the principles, the drafting committee members and the general assembly secretariat made careful revisions for days, and it is now published as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">General Assembly Declaration <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The foundation of national salvation lies in education, and the education of children is the most fundamental of all. Not only should poor and destitute children be given adequate education, but even wealthy families should make every effort to provide children with a complete education, so as to treat everyone equally and seek the happiness of equal education. At this time of national crisis, rural bankruptcy, and the lack of education and support for children are common. We should follow Confucius's meaning of "caring for the young and not only loving one's own children" and pay attention to the work of child welfare. In view of this, the China Child Welfare Association, based on Sun Yat-sen's Construction Program, Article 11, on childcare, has been working hard for the past six years and has drawn up a five-year plan for relief, education, sanitation, and various methods to protect children, with a clear outline and detailed items, hoping to achieve success. In addition, because the child welfare organizations in various provinces, counties, districts, and cities across the country have not been linked and unified, the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference was held from October 10th to 13th, 23rd year of the Republic of China. A total of 129 representatives from 15 provinces were invited to participate in the conference, and 95 proposals were submitted, which is an unprecedented achievement. The matters that have been passed have been handed over to the Child Welfare Association for execution. From now on, all our comrades, each will exhaust their intelligence and strive for practicality, without fearing difficulties, so that the existing child welfare organizations can be transformed and perfected to meet the scientific methods of education. In places where child welfare organizations have not been established, they must also be gradually promoted in accordance with the resolutions. In general, it can be divided into five categories: 1. Education: Do not be satisfied with the child welfare purpose of relief and nurturing, but also pay attention to the perfection of education. In addition to ordinary children, efforts must also be made to transform bad children, remedy disabled children, and advise and correct other abused children and families with various defects. The training of parents and teachers is also part of child welfare work. We must ensure that no child in the country is left unattended and that they can enjoy healthy and complete education, so as to achieve the development of children's physical and mental well-being. The strength of the country and the strengthening of the nation depend on this. 2. Relief: Do not be satisfied with sporadic relief and each taking in orphaned and poor children to avoid them ending up in ditches. We must unite the national forces to establish various specialized schools and factories, teach according to their aptitude, so that there are no unteachable children and no unachievable occupations, so as to block the source of poverty and cut off the cause of depravity. Even for wealthy children who drop out of school or whose parents indulge them in wandering, they should be advised, replace their bad habits with proper entertainment, and teach them to save money to avoid immorality. 3. Sanitation: The mortality rate of children in our country is higher than in Eastern and Western countries due to ignorance of methods of raising children hygienically. We should strive to promote and instill common sense, enforce prevention, strictly ban unqualified doctors, reward health, and conduct more competitions. Teaching and work that are not conducive to children's physical and mental health should be prohibited to protect children's health. 4. Legal Protection: The Chinese people still ignore many cruel and inhumane customs, such as drowning girls, abusing maids, destroying child brides, abandoning illegitimate children, and selling prostitutes. We urgently need to conduct strict investigations, impose severe punishments, and request the government to formulate children's laws and establish special children's courts to replace punishment with education so that they can reform themselves and respect humanity. This is also an important mission of our association. 5. Association Organization: Now, in order to revitalize and improve the existing child welfare organizations across the country in a short period of time and to establish a greater number of new organizations and implement dozens of new undertakings, it is impossible to achieve success without a strong general association that unites the organizations and directs and assists them from above. However, the funding is huge, and it cannot be covered by private donations. We hope that the government will expand its embrace, remember the teachings of protecting the infant, and allocate funds for permanent assistance, promotion, protection, and assistance at any time. We also hope that comrades across the country will be of one mind and work together, and carefully abide by the oath to do our best to relieve and educate the children of China today, to build the foundation of the family and society in the near future, and to build the foundation of the nation and country in the long run. This is also what the government will be happy to see. Next year is Children's Year. We hope that our colleagues will work hard in the child welfare industry, assist the government, and follow the progress of educating and nurturing children in the world's powers. We especially hope that our compatriots across the country will rise to the occasion and correct the shortcomings of this association. This declaration is hereby made in the hope that it will be made public.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Zhang Tinggui, Comprador of Sin Fung Company, Accused of Raping a Young Girl <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Victim Recently Gave Birth to a Daughter and Has Not Yet Recovered</p>
<p>The Judge Paid Attention to Whether She Was Over Sixteen Years Old</p>
<p>Zhang Tinggui is a local, 38 years old, and works as a comprador in Sin Fung Company at 117 Sassoon House, Nanjing Road Bund, Shanghai. He is fond of women. He had a local woman surnamed Song, 53 years old, living at 62 Gaofuli, Rue Notre Dame, French Concession. She had two daughters, the elder named Wanhua and the younger named Fudi. Because of poverty, Song sold her elder daughter Wanhua to a brothel as a singing girl. Because Fudi often visited her sister, she often played in the brothel. Zhang often went to the brothel to hire prostitutes to drink, so he met Fudi. At first sight, he was amazed and seduced her in every possible way. Because Fudi was young, she fell into his trap. On October 17 of last year, she was lured by Zhang to Room 502 of the Huaan Building and raped. He induced her with sweet words not to make a sound. In November, he raped her again. On December 4th, he raped her again in Room 44 of the Yipinxiang Hotel. Fudi became pregnant. Because she was not yet sixteen years old at the time, her mother, Song, noticed that her abdomen was gradually swelling and became suspicious. After questioning her, she learned the truth. Because what was done could not be undone, she tolerated it. Zhang Tinggui ignored Fudi and cut off contact. Song had no choice but to hire a lawyer to sue Zhang to the First Special Court for raping a girl under sixteen and disrupting public morals. Song lost in the first trial and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu presided over the first criminal court. Both sides arrived on time with their lawyers. The lawyer representing the appellant Shen Song first stated that the appellant Shen Song was unable to appear in court due to illness. The victim, Shen Fudi, gave birth to a daughter on the 11th of this month (October) after being raped and impregnated by the appellee Zhang Tinggui. She is not yet a month old and has not recovered, so she cannot appear in court. She requested the court to grant an extension and bring the newborn child to the court after the victim has recovered to request an examination of the child's face and blood to determine whether it is compatible with the appellee Zhang Tinggui to determine whether the appellee committed the crime. Judge Yu then said that the victim did not need to appear in court. The key to this case is whether the victim was under sixteen years old. The lawyer representing the appellant then stated that the victim was born on the sixth day of the twelfth lunar month in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the year of the Snake. There is a written record in the original trial. She was not yet sixteen years old when the appellee raped her in the Huaan Building, and the appellee cannot present any evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the appellee should be held liable under Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Yu questioned Zhang Tinggui and the lawyers on both sides argued for a long time, he announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the verdict for 2 PM on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The All-Circles Assistance Patriotic Martyrs Association Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>

<p>Requesting All Circles to Donate to Relieve Patriotic Martyrs</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Assistance Patriotic Martyrs Committee of various organizations in this city held a joint meeting at its meeting place on Tianhougong Bridge at 2 PM yesterday. Wang Jingdong, Zhang Yichen, Zhang Xianfang, Chen Jiufeng, Zheng Dongshan, Yu Yaoqiu, Ma Junshuo, Yu Hualong, Hu Fengxiang, Qiu Liangyu, Zhou Fuzhang, Qu Zhenhua, and others, more than 20 people, attended. Qu Zhenhua chaired the meeting and reported on the tragic situation of the patriotic martyrs imprisoned for their public duty, and that Pan Hongsheng was released on bail due to critical illness and urgently needed treatment, and that all the funds were urgently needed. It was resolved to discuss: (1) Request for amnesty for patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu and others to maintain the patriotic spirit and publicize the case of justice. It was resolved to submit a petition to the Central Government and transfer it to the Ministry of Justice for amnesty. (2) The family members of the patriotic martyr Pan are indeed poor and should be given relief. It was resolved to (a) distribute donation forms and (b) request assistance from all circles. (3) Pan Hongsheng is critically ill and urgently needs treatment. It was resolved to (a) be hospitalized for recuperation in the Hualong Chinese Hospital and (b) ask Dean Ding Jiwan and Director Wang Yumei of the hospital to carefully diagnose and treat him so that he can recover as soon as possible. (4) Handle all contact matters of the martyrs, and a committee was elected to be responsible. It was resolved that Commissioner Wei Chen Jiufeng would preside over it. (5) Commissioner Ye Jiaxing generously donated 100 yuan for the relief of the martyrs. It was resolved to (a) send a letter of thanks to Commissioner Ye and (b) first provide relief to Pan Hongsheng and others. The donation notice is recorded below: Respected Sirs, patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, and others were indignant at the shameless merchants who sold enemy goods and profited for their own benefit. They participated in the Blood Soul Elimination Group and pledged to eliminate traitors to awaken the people. In mid-November of the 21st year, Liu Chongwu and others were arrested one after another and imprisoned. At that time, all circles believed that the matter was for the sake of justice and asked for rescue, but it was not allowed by national law. Only in terms of human sentiment, in addition to submitting another document to the Central Government requesting pity and granting amnesty to comfort the public, the families of Liu and others are also poor and helpless. This Association is fully aware of the tragic situation of the martyrs and convened a meeting to discuss assistance measures to provide relief. We hope that leaders from all circles will contribute to relieve the imprisoned martyrs. Please take note.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Doumu Pavilion of the Guandi Temple in Ximen Collapsed <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Injuring Eight Guests Surnamed Ye</p>
<p>Ye Apei, a local resident living at 25 Yongnianli, Chengdu Road, works at the Commercial Press. Yesterday was the birthday of his ancestors, so he was introduced by a friend surnamed Chen living at 10 Anlefang, Penglai Road in this city to host a banquet at the Guandi Temple in Ximen, booking seven tables of vegetarian dishes at six yuan per table. However, there were as many as six families using the temple yesterday, and the Ye family was arranged in the east hall, on the second floor of the three-bay Doumu Pavilion. The downstairs was occupied by a Tong family. At 3:10 PM, Ye's relatives and friends took their seats together. Just as they were about to start eating, they suddenly heard a strange sound from the floor. In an instant, with a loud bang, the central part completely collapsed, injuring eight guests, including Hou Chaogen (28 years old, back broken), Liu Rujin (22 years old, right foot), Chen Jisheng (35 years old, shoulder and right foot), Zhou Bofa (34 years old, face), Shen Binlin (30 years old, head), and Wen Luping (32 years old, head). The above six people were sent to Renji Hospital. Ji Zhenggao and Wu Ruda were sent to Shanghai Hospital. At that time, the monk in charge of the temple, Daming, reported to the Chenxiangge Sub-bureau, who immediately sent many police officers to investigate the cause of the collapse. The east hall was a newly built building, and the wood inside was unusually large, so there was no reason for it to collapse. It was found that there were two horizontal girders in the central floor. Because the end of one of the horizontal beams was carved with patterns about an inch deep, and the tenon was only about an inch deep, the force was too great, the patterns were destroyed, the girder came loose, and the entire structure collapsed. Fortunately, the Tong family downstairs had finished their banquet and left only a few minutes before the disaster occurred, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p>

Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit in the First Special District District Court. Two hearings have already been held, but the defendant, Ren Ying, has failed to appear in court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen summoned her again. According to the bailiff's written report, the defendant has no fixed address and therefore cannot be summoned. The plaintiff's lawyer then immediately applied for public notice service. The court approved the plaintiff's request and instructed the plaintiff to continue investigating the defendant's residence, report the findings, and schedule another hearing for the afternoon of November 8.</p>

<p>Even Stabbing Him with a Knife</p>
<p>Eldest Brother Escapes, Younger Brother Arrested</p>
<p>Cai Deli, a 45-year-old rickshaw puller from Jiangbei who resides at No. 32 Jingcheng Fang, Route du Père Robert, in the French Concession, has two sons. The eldest son, Shun Sheng, is 22 years old and also makes a living pulling a rickshaw. The younger son, Lian Sheng, is 19 years old and works as a road construction worker. The father and sons live together. On the evening of the 27th of last month, around 6:00 PM, Cai was at home washing rice and cooking porridge for dinner when his younger son, Lian Sheng, returned home from work. Lian Sheng scolded his father for cooking porridge for the evening meal, wanting to wash rice again and cook rice for a proper meal, leading to an argument. Unexpectedly, Lian Sheng refused to back down and argued back rudely. Cai became angry and grabbed Lian Sheng, beating him. As the father and son were grappling, unable to separate, Cai's eldest son, Shun Sheng, returned home from his rickshaw shift. Seeing his younger brother being beaten by their father, he immediately joined in without asking the reason, helping his brother beat their elderly father, causing Cai Deli to be injured and stabbed twice in the back with a knife, the source of the stabbing is unknown. Shun Sheng and Lian Sheng, the two brothers, knocked their father to the ground and fled. Later, Cai reported the incident to the Yu Jia Wan French Police Station, stating that he had been beaten and stabbed by his two sons and requesting their arrest and investigation. The police chief ordered Cai to be taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment and dispatched detectives to investigate. Cai's two sons were on the run until the day before yesterday, when the detective arrested Cai's younger son, Cai Lian Sheng. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, presented the case, stating that the defendant and his brother, who is still at large, were charged with harming a direct ascendant relative and were arrested yesterday. The police stated that they still needed to investigate and that the victim's injuries had not yet healed and he was still undergoing treatment, so he was not present. He requested a seven-day postponement to investigate the case and arrest the defendant who was still at large, and then bring them to trial. Judge Li Changnian reviewed the report, briefly questioned the defendant, and then approved the postponement for further investigation before the trial, with the defendant remaining in custody.</p>

<p>Pretending to Find a Bicycle</p>
<p>Attempting to Swindle Ten Silver Dollars</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Japanese Daily News, on the 3rd of this month, Yimoto Kōtō, a clerk at the Kinoshita Seiji Laundry Store at No. 989 North Szechuan Road, lost a bicycle in the Chang'an Li area of Wusong. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a man around 25 or 26 years old visited Yimoto, claiming to be Detective Ei Shokumura of the Central Office of the Municipal Council. He said, "The criminal who stole your bicycle has been arrested. According to the criminal, the bicycle has been pawned at a Chinese pawnshop in the city. If you pay ten dollars, you can redeem it." Yimoto suspected that the man's appearance was suspicious and told him that he had no money on hand. He asked if they could go to see the bicycle together. The man replied that they would go together at 9:00 AM the next morning and then hurriedly left. Yimoto followed him and saw him fleeing in front of the Da'an Automobile Company. Yimoto inquired with the police about Detective Shokumura, but there was no such person. The Japanese Consul-General issued a notice to all police stations, ordering them to conduct a thorough search for the Japanese national who was impersonating a detective to extort money.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Robbery in Zhoujiadu <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Loss of Over Four Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>At No. 23, West Zhangjiazhai, Zhoujiadu, Pudong, the resident Zhou Shunji, a local foreman, had a modest family fortune, which attracted thieves. Yesterday morning around 1:00 AM, a gang of seven or eight thieves, carrying guns, broke into Zhou's house from the river on the east side. One thief climbed a willow tree and crossed the small river, climbing onto the roof through the east window. They then dropped bamboo poles from the sunshade into the courtyard and opened the door, using wooden planks to create a bridge over the river, allowing the other thieves to enter. The homeowner was awakened and looked outside but was threatened by the thieves with guns and ordered to remain silent. The family, men and women, were tied up with ropes and covered with quilts. The thieves then began to search the house, ransacking trunks and boxes, stealing two gold bracelets, four gold hairpins, one gold watch, one gold lock pendant, nine gold rings, two gold ear picks, two gold chains, three gold bangles, one self-made gun, one shotgun, three men's and women's fur coats, two bolts of spun silk, and dozens of articles of men's and women's clothing, as well as over nine hundred silver dollars, totaling over four thousand dollars in value. After obtaining the loot, they escaped in the same way they came, crossing the river and fleeing northeast. The neighbors in the same residence did not hear anything. After the thieves left, around 4:00 AM, the victim's nephew, Zhou Bingliang, reported the incident to the Zhoujiadu Police Station. Police Chief Liang Wenqing led officers to search for the thieves, but they had already fled far away due to the time that had passed. At 7:00 AM, Inspector Xiao Jingfu from the Yangsiqiao Branch Station went to investigate the scene and immediately reported it to the Tangqiao Police Station for review. Director Dong, noting that the thieves spoke with a Jiangbei-Anhui accent, ordered officers such as Zhou Rulin to conduct a strict search.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Correct the Ganzhou County Post Office's Increased Fees for Registered Items <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Communications in Nanjing: On the 17th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Ganzhou County Domestic Piece Goods Trade Association, Foreign Goods Trade Association, and Dyeing Trade Association, stating that Ganzhou City is an important town in southern Jiangxi, where merchants gather and ships converge. In the past, goods were mostly transported from Shanghai and Hankou. However, since the bandit communists caused disturbances and the Gan River was blockaded, merchants in Shanghai purchase piece goods and other goods, mostly sending them by parcel post. The Ganzhou County Post Office, citing the increased number of parcels and the high cost of transporting them by rickshaw, requires recipients of parcels from Shanghai and Hankou via Ji'an to pay an additional two 'simple fees,' while parcels routed through Guangzhou require recipients to pay an additional one 'simple fee' before they can pick up their goods. Parcels sent directly from Guangzhou to Ganzhou are not subject to additional fees, which is particularly puzzling, undermining the uniformity of the postal service and increasing the suffering of merchants. The merchants Liu Yixiang, Zeng Tangcheng, Wang Xiangkun, and Xiao Xintian of the association presented a petition to the Nanjing Ministry of Communications, Shanghai Postal Administration, and Jiangxi Postal Administration in Shanghai in 1933, requesting that the fees be abolished, which was duly recorded. The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Approval No. 2618, stating that the postage for parcels sent by post is determined according to the distance, traffic conditions, and the amount of freight paid. Therefore, when traffic conditions change in various places, resulting in increased freight costs, the respective administrations may, according to the circumstances, charge the sender or receiver half, one, or several 'simple fees' to cover the costs. If freight costs in Ganzhou return to normal, the additional fees will be reduced or abolished. The merchants' parcels to Ganzhou must be routed through Guangzhou for delivery, resulting in high freight costs. The Ganzhou County Post Office's charging of an additional 'simple fee' has been approved and is not inappropriate. However, in the future, when freight costs decrease, the additional fee should be reduced or abolished. We have already instructed the Jiangxi Postal Administration to pay attention to this matter and inform them of this decision. According to reports, the Ganzhou-Geng and Ganzhou border highways have been opened to traffic, and long-distance buses can directly reach Shaozhou and Nanchang. Transportation is convenient and fast, and mail is transported entirely by buses, so freight costs should be reduced. The previous reason for charging additional fees due to rickshaw transportation no longer exists. Since freight costs have returned to normal, the additional 'simple fee' should be abolished to comply with postal regulations. However, the Ganzhou County Post Office is violating postal regulations, disregarding the difficulties of merchants, and extorting money for its own benefit, continuing to charge the fees, which is illegal. If this continues, the merchants in Ganzhou will undoubtedly suffer, and the goods from Shanghai and Hankou entering southern Jiangxi will also be greatly affected."</p>
<p>"In addition to requesting that the Jiangxi Postal Administration order the abolition of the fees, we are submitting this document to your esteemed ministry for review and request that you, based on the situation, forward it for approval and abolition to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully petitions. We have investigated that the postal service charges postage for parcels according to regulations. Additional postage fees from the sender or receiver should only be charged when local conditions change, causing an increase in postal transportation costs. The so-called change in local conditions only refers to traffic obstructions and the postal service needing to detour, and there is no other reason to increase freight costs. Now, goods from Shanghai and Hankou entering southern Jiangxi have very convenient transportation, and freight costs have actually decreased, so the local post office's continued collection of postage fees from recipients is completely unreasonable. Based on the above, we respectfully request that your esteemed ministry order the correction of this situation to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully prays."</p>

<p>Report on the Government's Levy of Silver Tax</p>

Committee members Chen Guangfu, Xu Jiyin, Ye Fuxiao, Bei Songsun, Tang Shoumin, Song Ziliang, Wang Zhixin, Li Fukun, Qu Jigang, Xu Boming, Wang Boyuan, and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou were present. Chen Guangfu and Bei Songsun successively reported on the government's imposition of silver export tax, stating that since August, the outflow of silver from China has gradually increased. In view of this, the government, in order to prevent this, implemented an additional silver export tax of 7.75% from the 15th of the month to prevent silver from flowing out further, and also imposed a balancing tax to make it unprofitable for speculators. As for the rumors that the government would reduce the fineness of silver coins, after inquiring with the financial authorities, they firmly denied this and said that there was no such thing. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Zhabei District Rent Reduction Association Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The rent reduction movement in the Zhabei district has been underway for nine months. Petitions have been submitted to the municipal government repeatedly, but no clear response has been received. The suffering of the people increases daily. With the end of the year approaching and concerns about people's livelihoods, the association appointed Xu Zaikang, Ma Rugen, You Lanjie, Shan Wuchu, and others as representatives to petition the municipal government yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Section Chief Yu Mingde of the Second Section met with them on behalf of the mayor, stating that after Mayor Yu received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarding the rent reduction issue, he repeatedly discussed solutions with the court. However, the legal community argued that there was no legal basis. This opinion has been reported back to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The representatives then spoke successively, all emphasizing that rent reduction is needed by society and desired by the entire city, and is not a matter of law. Delays only increase disputes, and legal entanglements result in unnecessary losses of money and time for merchants and residents. If the mayor is a follower of Sun Yat-sen, then he should seek ways to mediate and stabilize society and restore prosperity to the market. If rent reduction is impossible, then please make a clear statement so that the people can understand the situation and know what to do. As for the claim of "no legal basis," there are precedents from the 16th and 21st years. Therefore, if the mayor can consider the people's livelihood, please mediate and make a prompt decision to avoid disputes and relieve the people's suffering. Section Chief Yu expressed sympathy, accepted the petition to the fullest extent possible, and promised to forward it to the mayor for a decision. It was noon when the representatives left to await a response. The original petition is recorded below. The petition requests a decision on rent reduction to relieve the people's suffering. The association previously stated that due to the sluggish market and the poverty of the people, and the increasing cost of rent, the general merchants and residents are in a state of constant fear of hardship. Therefore, we have been calling for a reduction in the burden to help those merchants in trouble and have submitted several petitions, which Your Honor has approved to refer to the central government for resolution. Nine months have passed, and no instructions have been received, and the relationship between landlords and tenants has deteriorated. Therefore, the money, time, and spirit that common people have spent on legal entanglements in court are unknown. Who among the residents of Zhabei has not survived a catastrophe, and how can they endure this double suffering? Moreover, social issues are administrative matters. We ask that you consider the difficulties of the people and their plight to relieve their suffering, resolve disputes, and secure their livelihoods.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Public Concession's Sanitary Conditions Last Month <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Report from the Municipal Council's Health Officer for September: The prevailing diseases this month were intestinal diseases, more so than dysentery. Although these diseases are not as severe as cholera, they still require urgent research. However, no results have yet been obtained. It is unlikely that there will be a reduction until more effective management of food preparation and milk supply is achieved.</p>
<p>Malaria has also become more prevalent recently. One of the reasons is that residents are gradually moving to quieter areas, making them more susceptible to mosquito bites. Also, mosquitoes have become more numerous in the central area in the past two years. This is because the newest buildings are often built on basements, and the gaps inside the basements become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which are extremely difficult to eradicate. This matter is currently being studied, but this is a new problem, and few countries have paid attention to it, so there is a lack of reference material.</p>
<p>The mortality rate this month remains low. Aside from the above, the infectious disease situation is generally normal. There are no more cases of cholera, so the injection vehicles were changed to smallpox vaccination on October 1. The total number of people vaccinated this season was only 249,106. Despite strong publicity efforts, people are not paying attention because cholera is rarely seen. The open-air swimming pools closed at the end of September. The number of visitors this year exceeded previous years. The increase in ticket prices was unavoidable, but as a result, undesirable elements were reduced, and the pools were not too crowded.</p>
<p>Physical examinations for schoolchildren have now officially begun. A lot of material has been obtained. Once the initial work is completed, appropriate action can be taken to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>The birth rate for foreigners this month was 14.54 per thousand. The number of Chinese births reported was 298, of which 241 were residents of the Concession. As for deaths, the most common causes among Chinese were tuberculosis, typhoid fever, dysentery, and gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>The medical laboratory performed 3,387 tests this month, of which 542 had formal reactions. 179 food samples were inspected, of which 32 did not meet standards. 80 people sought treatment at the rabies clinic, and 9 of them came from outside the city.</p>
<p>The Chinese Isolation Hospital admitted 55 people last month, but this month the number increased to 74. 12 people died. 20 people were admitted due to diphtheria, which was the largest number. There were no cases of smallpox. Several people requested admission to the mental hospital, but they could not be admitted because there was no room.</p>
<p>The average daily milk production was 29,310 pounds, an increase of over 7% compared to last month. The results of the milk sample inspections showed that 4 samples did not meet chemical standards and 22 did not meet bacterial standards. Two employees were sent to court and fined for transporting milk without a license. The supply of meat was generally normal. The number of pigs slaughtered increased significantly due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, increasing by 14.4% compared to last month. The waste meat disposal facility disposed of 56,899 pounds of meat.</p>
<p>The work of the cleaning division, in addition to injections, has extended the date for fly and mosquito prevention. Well water disinfection has also been extended to the fall to prevent intestinal diseases. There have been many complaints about the nuisance of soot to neighbors, and most of these cases have been effectively handled, but there are one or two cases that are too big and are being considered.

<h3 id="e161">The Qinyuan Village Drug Manufacturing Organization Was Highly Organized <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Workers in Each Department Were Not Allowed to Interact</p>
<p>The Product Was the Extremely Toxic Heroin</p>
<p>Three Criminals Have Been Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Cai Bicheng, a Sichuanese who had resigned as a county magistrate in Sichuan Province, brought his family to Shanghai and resided at No. 24 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha. He also leased the newly built four-story building at Nos. 175-177 Avenue Haig from the Dayao Construction Company on Museum Road to establish a morphine factory. On Double Ten Day, a fire broke out due to careless refining by workers. The workers in the factory fled together, and only three workers, Gong Baochang, Miao Zhangcai, and Gong Wenhu, were arrested. Cai heard the news at his residence that day and also abandoned his home with his family and belongings and fled. The Xinzha police station arrested Gong and the other two the next day and sent them to the First Special District District Court for questioning and detention. Judge Liu Yugui personally went to the scene to investigate the situation, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the drugs left in the factory after the fire have been tested in detail by the Municipal Council's Chemical Laboratory and identified as heroin, which is more toxic than morphine. However, it was only in the preliminary stage of production, so it was still in a sandy state. If it were further refined in the second step, it could become pure heroin. There are currently 304 pounds of this crude heroin, which is of considerable value at current prices. In addition to the three employees arrested, Wang Bingfu, Xu Ajin, Hu Yunqi, Liu Zhifen, and a Mr. Ren and a Mr. Wang escaped, along with the factory owner Cai Bicheng, for a total of seven people. Among them, Mr. Wang and Mr. Xu held the most important positions. Mr. Wang was the one who leased the house from Dayao, and Mr. Xu was the foreman. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu held a hearing, ordering Detective Tang Jian and Detective Lu Gendi to bring the three defendants, Gong Baochang, etc., to court for questioning. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the case and requested that the defendants be punished in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. He also requested that arrest warrants be issued for the fugitives. The court then questioned the three defendants, Gong, etc. However, none of them revealed anything about the factory's manufacturing situation, saying that they were all introduced to the factory by Xu Ajin and were assigned to the fourth floor to put wet wool into glass bottles, put them in pots, and bake them in the stove. When they were dry, they sent them to the third floor to be received by Xu Ajin. Those who worked on the fourth floor were not allowed to go to the third floor without permission, and those who worked on the third floor were not allowed to go to the fourth floor. The boundaries were strict, like a chasm. Judge Liu said that although the three of them joined the drug manufacturing group because they were tempted by others, if they could repent in time and confess the secrets of the factory in detail without concealment, they could be leniently treated. Therefore, he repeatedly instructed them to confess the truth. However, Gong and the others did not confess the working situation of how they produced the drugs in court. Judge Liu then announced the verdict: Gong Baochang, Miao Zhangcai, and Gong Wenhu were sentenced to six months of fixed-term imprisonment for continuously assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. The seized crude heroin and other raw materials, as well as all equipment, were confiscated. The car used to transport opium was also confiscated, and the wool was burned. The case can be said to be over. Cai Bicheng and the other seven fugitives are now wanted, and they will be dealt with separately when they are arrested.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Representative of Western Shipping Companies in Pudong Requests Supervision of Garbage Disposal <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of Western shipping companies in Pudong, yesterday submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the dumping of garbage in the Pudong area, which obstructs waterways, it is earnestly requested that the Health Bureau and Public Security Bureau be ordered to strictly prohibit such activity to preserve the commercial port. The Huangpu River serves as the main waterway connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, free of reefs or shallows. Large ships from Dengzhou, Laizhou, Fujian, Guangdong, and foreign import merchant vessels can navigate with confidence and without hindrance. This is why Shanghai has earned the reputation as a world-renowned commercial port, and rightfully so. However, in recent years, the city and the British and French concessions have had difficulty finding locations to dispose of garbage. Land was purchased in the shallows near Longhua Mouth for dumping. However, those contracted to transport the garbage are all commercial business and the contract prices are harsh. As such, the hired laborers are unwilling to diligently unload the garbage. Instead, they dump it into the Huangpu River progressively as the tide rises south of Gaochang Temple. Heavy items such as bricks, tiles, stone chips, and coal sand sink immediately upon being dumped, leaving no trace. As for lighter, floating materials like rice straw and firewood, they float south to Tangkou with the high tide during major floods, accumulating and stagnating along both banks of the Huangpu River, obstructing waterways. It is believed that the Huangpu River is crucial to Shanghai's transportation and commercial development. Currently, in the southern Shanghai area, both banks of the Huangpu River are gradually being filled, while muddy currents and sand are continuously accumulating. Moreover, boatmen also dump garbage into the Huangpu River. With daily accumulation, it is feared that transportation will be obstructed by shallows, and the future consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, not daring to act presumptuously, this humble request is submitted, earnestly imploring your esteemed office to review and approve it and promptly instruct the Health Bureau and Public Security Bureau to closely inspect and supervise the loading and unloading of garbage along the route. Also, during minor floods and night tides, stop the boats from sailing to avoid dumping under the cover of night, thereby preserving the commercial port. The undersigned would be deeply grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Lumber Industry Resolves Method for Converting Foreign Pine to Market Scale <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Indicate the length of the market scale under the original size.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lumber Industry Association believes that since the promulgation of the new system of weights and measures, there have been considerable obstacles to the sale of foreign pine in the industry. This is because foreign pine comes from Europe, America, Russia and elsewhere, and its scale of measurement is cut according to English feet when manufactured. This is not like the yardage of cloth, which can be measured and calculated by merchants at any time. For example, if there is a piece of foreign pine that is 16 English feet long, 12 inches wide, and 2 inches thick, it has already been sawn into lumber. Buyers and sellers trade according to the original scale. There is no room for change or expansion on either side. The members of the association, in order to respect the national system, have repeatedly consulted with foreign firms, requesting that foreign pine sold to China be sawn according to Chinese legal standards of measurement in the future. According to the foreign firms, the annual sales of European and American foreign pine are very large, and those sold to China account for less than one-tenth of the total. Their sawing machines and lumber scales are all manufactured to suit the English foot. If China wants them to change the sawing and change the scale, it is difficult to do so in reality. After repeated discussions, the association decided to calculate and price according to the original scale, intending to indicate the size of the Chinese market scale under the English foot scale, and calculate it using the "four-in-five-out" method for the convenience of transactions. The industry association has reported this method to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for record.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Xinhua Village Successfully Constructed <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Land prices on West Physical Education Association Road soar</p>
<p>Since the Xinhua Bank constructed Xinhua Village on West Physical Education Association Road in this city, the price of land in the surrounding area has been rising successively, reaching more than 6,000 taels per mu. As a result, some landowners along West Physical Education Association Road are waiting for a good price to sell, while others are starting to build houses. In addition, the road is a major thoroughfare connecting the concession and the city center, with frequent traffic and increasing activity. It is rumored that the site of the former National Shanghai College of Commerce across from the village is also planned to be rebuilt with new houses. Therefore, prosperity is imminent in the near future. It is said that Xinhua Bank did not consider the issue of profit when proposing Xinhua Village, due to its complete facilities (such as schools, shops, vegetable markets, children's parks, and tennis courts, etc.) and low selling prices. The prices were completely based on cost. However, after the increase in tariffs, the price of building materials has doubled. Since the bank had made a declaration earlier that it would not change the selling price before December of this year, it has made many sacrifices. It is now said that after December, the bank will consider increasing the price of construction, hoping to reduce the sacrifices slightly. Therefore, the selling price of the village may change in the future. It is also said that one of the four houses completed before the exhibition has already been sold, and people are contacting the other three houses every day, fearing that after the price changes, it will be difficult to obtain such affordable housing and excellent environmental areas.</p>

<p>The travel savings offered by the Shanghai Bank at 589 Xiafei Road in this city does not restrict the amount of deposit or the period of storage. When a considerable amount has been accumulated, it can be used for travel purposes at any time. If the depositor is not familiar with the route, the bank will introduce the China Travel Service to plan the itinerary, take care of the journey, guide the tour, and enjoy various preferential rights. It is a faithful guide for those who aspire to travel. The bank aims to promote this and the interest rate is especially favorable. Since its launch, it has been well received by people from all walks of life who have eagerly opened accounts, so travel magazines are now added as a gift to increase interest and to live up to the enthusiasm of supporters.</p>

<p>The excellent performance of students at the National Conservatory of Music has long been praised by society. The professors employed are all well-known both in China and abroad. It is heard that the school has been established for seven years and many of the professors have served for more than five or six years. Therefore, the professors will hold a concert to promote high-quality music. All the performances will be performed by the professors. The first concert will be held at the end of this month in the auditorium on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, as the hall can accommodate a large audience. It is observed that whenever the school holds student concerts, the audience is crowded and there are no empty seats. This time, the professors will personally perform on stage, and its grand occasion can be predicted even more.</p>

<p>Detectives Uncover and Capture</p>
<p>Receiver of Stolen Goods Detained Simultaneously</p>
<p>Recently, shops and residents in the Nanshi area have been frequently targeted by individuals impersonating employees of the electric company, claiming to repair electric lights and meters, but in reality, replacing good meters with faulty ones and stealing the good meters. At the time, the shops believed them to be genuine, so those whose meters were stolen include: (1) Du Shunxing Garden, opened by Du Deqing at 452 Liyuan Road; (2) The home of Wen Xiaofeng at 9 Zhonghua Lane, Zhonghua Road; (3) Wanshunxing Clothing Store, opened by Jin Ruilin at 283 Xinqiao Road; (4) Gu Chaoqing's tiger stove at 28 Dapu Road; (5) Dong Mingde's home at 1449 Xietu Road; (6) Xue Haitao's home at 1294 Xietu Road; (7) Wang Jinbao's home at 18 Wuyun Lane, Xuxie Road; (8) Jin Guisheng's home at 370 Manufacturing Bureau Road; (9) Guan Rongxing's copper shop at 257 Manufacturing Bureau Road; (10) Hu Jingqi's home at 391 Huimi Road; (11) Cheng Yushu's home at 216 Menghua Street inside Ximen; (12) Shen Shunji's home at 233 Xinma Road, Yuyingtang, Zhabei, totaling thirteen households. The victims reported the incidents to Lu Bohong, General Manager of the China Electric Company, who in turn reported to Lu Ying, Captain of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting officers to investigate and apprehend the criminals. It is now known that Captain Lu dispatched Detective Leader Gao Wansheng, leading detectives Cao Baolin, Shi Yongquan, etc., to take charge of the investigation. Until noon the day before yesterday, they discovered that the meter thief was stealing an electric meter at the home of Zhang Hongji at 2 Zhangjiabang, Xinqiao Road, Nanshi. They uncovered the crime on the spot and arrested the thief. After interrogation, the thief confessed that he was Shi Liangyu, from Shaoxing, residing at 38 Luban Road, Nanshi. He used to work at the Gaochang Temple Arsenal, but is now unemployed and unable to make a living. Therefore, he purchased broken electric meters at low prices from various secondhand stalls, impersonating a mechanic to steal good meters, admitting to stealing from thirteen households, totaling thirteen electric meters, which he sold to Wang Changyi, a Jiangbei native who runs the Changji secondhand store at 189 Baoshan Lane, Pingjili Road, French Concession. The team then escorted the suspect Shi, together with detectives from the French Concession police station, to the address to continue the investigation, arresting Wang Changyi, the receiver of stolen goods. After interrogation, Wang made cunning excuses, refusing to confess the truth. Yesterday morning, both were sent to the Third Section for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Children's Welfare Association Uncovers Human Traffickers <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Li Bingyan, a staff member of the Protection Department of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, recently discovered that Wang Yueying (20 years old, from Huzhou) and Li Pu (49 years old, from Suzhou, resident of Sande Lane) of 2 Chunyuan Lane, Jiumudi, are suspected of human trafficking. He immediately reported to the Chairman of the Committee, requesting the Municipal Public Security Bureau to assist in the arrest. Director Wen ordered the Laobeimen Police Station under his jurisdiction to assist Staff Member Li in arresting Wang Yueying and Li Pu at 9:10 a.m. yesterday, as well as Wang's husband, Wen Qiusheng (35 years old, from Guangdong), their adopted daughter Zhaodi (7 years old, from Shanghai), and Li Pu's adopted daughter Yang Huizhen (17 years old, from Suzhou), and related person Lu Zhenting (59 years old, from Suzhou), and brought them to the station for verification. After interrogation by Station Chief Shen, Wang Yueying and Wen Qiusheng confessed that they bought the seven-year-old girl Zhaodi two weeks ago for sixty yuan through a middleman to be their adopted daughter. As for Yang Huizhen, they claimed that she was bought by their former domestic helper Li Pu. According to Li Pu, Yang Huizhen was purchased from Yang Yi in Suzhou on August 26 for six hundred yuan, with Lu Zhenting acting as a middleman, to be her adopted daughter because she was old and had no children to rely on. According to Lu Zhenting, Yang Huizhen was entrusted to him by a monk named Xia to act as a middleman. As the case involves the buying and selling of human beings, which is against the law, it is to be transferred to the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Yu Ying, Captain of the Detective Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, stationed in the West Shanghai area, dispatched Detective Leaders Wu Kezhong and Cao Chuqiao. Yesterday, they received a tip that an opium den selling red pills was located at 3517 Nanyinghua Lane, Kunlun Concession, and 3 Guide Lane, Bailinan Road, and that the business was booming. They immediately gave the informant three yuan and four jiao, who purchased a small bag of red pills containing five hundred pills from Nanyinghua Lane and brought them to the bureau. After reporting to Director Wang, they supervised detectives Zhang Wenbin, Zhong Xuehuai, Zang Nai, Zhang Shaoming, Shi Yulin, etc. to first go to 3 Guide Lane and arrest Wang Er, Zhang Jinyuan, Hu Yongxiang, and Tang Zhangshi, along with a package of red pills, and took them to the bureau.

<p>Six-year-old Zhang Xiaojiang Abducted</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, patrolling officers from the Putuo Road police station in West Shanghai noticed a woman carrying a boy of about six or seven years old, crying incessantly. The woman looked panicked and was trying to drag the child away. The officers, suspicious of the situation, immediately took them to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, it was revealed that the woman's name was Hu Liu, 24 years old, from Anhui, residing in a lime kiln in Xiaoshadu. The child's name was Zhang Xiaojiang, 6 years old, and was abducted by his neighbor, Li Li, who instructed Hu to send the child to Ling Kebing's house at 230 Baike Road, which specializes in selling children, with the intention of trafficking him. As the incident occurred in the Chinese territory, the police chief immediately sent the woman and child to the Caojiadu Branch. Director Wang immediately ordered Detective Team Leaders Wu Kezhong and Cao Chuqiao to go to 230 Baike Road with the police station detectives. They arrested Ling Kebing and his wife Ling Zhangshi (from Jiaxing), and also arrested Ling Desheng (renamed, 7 years old), a boy from Jiaxing who had just been abducted and was being sold, as well as a sales receipt and more than a dozen pawn tickets. They were all taken to the police station. They then sent police officers to the lime kiln to bring Li Li, the abductor, and Zhang Yunshou (29 years old, from Baoying), the father of the abducted child, to the police station. After separate interrogations by the police officers, the facts were confirmed. As the case involves the trafficking of children, which is a criminal offense, it was sentenced to be transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation after filing a report.</p>

<p>Since this spring, the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Dalianwan Road, Hongkou, has been improving its business strategy day by day. As a result, exports have increased sharply. The recently released Warrior sports shoes are particularly well-made and durable, and sales are even more brisk. Sales offices in this and other cities have sent letters requesting more goods, causing congestion. As a result, the products cannot meet the demand.

<p>Zong Jiao, a Cantonese doctor residing at 53 Dexing Lane, Peng Road, Hongkou, 32 years old, impersonated a public official of the French Police Department at 5 p.m. on the 4th of this month and went to the home of his fellow villager Su Pan at 1 Xiangxing Lane, 91 Dada Road, claiming to be investigating swallow nests and extorting 10 yuan, or else he would arrest her. Pan did not realize the truth and begged for mercy. Because she had no money, she only gave him 16 jiao. Zong took the money and hurriedly left in a rickshaw. He was spotted by his fellow villager Yuan Guiqiao, who followed Zong to the intersection of Aiduya Road and Jiangxi Road, where he shouted for the police and arrested Zong, who was taken to the British police station. The French police station sent detectives to take him back and send him to the Special Second Court for prosecution on charges of intimidation. As reported in the previous newspaper, the trial has concluded. Yesterday, Judge Cao sentenced Zong Jiao to eight months in prison and a fine of 500 yuan. The fine can be converted to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Cao Zhenhai Sentenced for Arson <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Cao Zhenhai, a 58-year-old man from Yangzhou, rented a cigarette and paper shop at 603 Ronghua Lane, Malang Road, French Concession, from Lin Rongbao, a Ningbo native, in February last year. The business was doing well. However, in February this year, Lin poached Cao's shop assistants, Wang Guanglan and Zhuang Ruixing, and jointly invested with Wang Guang, a native of Zhenjiang, to open a Ronghua store next to Cao's shop in Ronghua Lane, causing Cao's business and customers to be taken away. From then on, Cao's business failed and he suffered a loss. Cao harbored resentment. At midnight on the 9th of this month, he soaked cotton wool in kerosene and set fire to the shop, intending to burn down the Ronghua store and kill Lin's entire family to vent his anger. The fire was discovered by neighbors who alerted the fire department, which rushed to put out the fire. The police station investigated the cause of the fire and arrested Cao, who was sent to the Special Second Court for public prosecution. The trial proceedings were reported in the previous newspaper. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Li Changnian of the Criminal Court sentenced Cao Zhenhai yesterday morning to eight months in prison for setting fire to his own residence and causing public danger. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the sentencing, Cao was transferred to the detention center to await the appeal period before being sent to prison for execution.</p>

<p>At around 7 p.m. on September 4 of this year, Xie Arong and Ji Laosan formed a feud and fought in front of the Juxing Lane entrance of Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou. As a result, someone fired a gun, and a stray bullet injured Liu Jinfa, a 21-year-old apprentice from Hangzhou who worked for Wuhua Ge Factory in Juxing Lane. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but died. The local court sent personnel to verify and prepare the coffin. The police station arrested a suspect, Sun Jieshou, and sent him to the court. Prosecutor Li Fen interrogated him and determined that he was guilty of murder and filed a public prosecution. A court hearing was held some days ago. Sun vehemently denied the charges. The judge ordered the witnesses to be summoned for verification. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the Fifth Court for trial. The defendant Sun Jieshou hired lawyer Zhang Ji to appear in court to defend him. The first witness, Zhu Dafu, testified that he was 21 years old, from Shanghai, and worked as a partner, manager, and general accountant for the Mingsheng Smelting Factory. Question: What position did Sun Jieshou hold in your factory? Answer: Supervisor. Our factory has a chief foreman Zhu Guifu and two supervisors, one is Sun Jieshou and the other is Chen Jinfen. Question: How many workers are there in total? Answer: Fifteen. Question: Did Sun Jieshou come to work at the factory on September 4? Answer: He came to the factory to work, arriving at the factory at 5:30 p.m. and starting the night shift at 6 o'clock. Question: Did you see Sun Jieshou? Answer: I saw him. The judge said, "This is a serious murder case, you can't say it casually." Answer: I really saw him. Question: What clothes did you see him wearing? Answer: He was wearing a black-gray Hua Te woolen long gown. Question: Did Sun Jieshou eat at the factory? Answer: Yes, he did. Question: How many people were at the same table? Answer: I, Sun Jieshou, Zhu Guihai, and six others were at the same table. The judge ordered Sun Jieshou to be brought to the case to testify. Question: What time did you enter the factory on September 4? Answer: I arrived at the factory at 5:30 p.m. and started work at 6 p.m. Question: What clothes did you wear that day? Answer: I wore a black Xiangyun gauze short gown and trousers. Question: Did you eat dinner? Answer: Yes, I did. Question: How many people ate at the same table? Answer: Eight people. The judge ordered Zhu Laosan to testify that the gun was held by Sun Jieshou. Because the swallow's nest opened by Xie Arong was captured by the police station, they said that I was "releasing the dragon," so they made things difficult for me. I was afraid of the gun, so I ran away and was not poisoned by the gun. At this point, Prosecutor Li came to the court and made a speech. The judge ordered the start of the debate. Lawyer Zhang Ji rose to defend the defendant for a long time. The judge ordered the debate to end and scheduled the sentencing for 10 a.m. on the 24th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e178">"Red Sheep Heroes" Receives Crowded Audiences <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of promoting national spirit and commemorating revolutionary martyrs, the Gong Wu Stage has arranged to perform "Red Sheep Heroes." The three volumes have now been staged. The whole play takes Tang Zhengcai's training of the navy and Xiao Chaogui's death as two major backbones. Tang Zhengcai was the commander-in-chief of the navy when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom sealed the navigation king. Tang Zhengcai's contribution was not small as the Taiping Army went down the river. The play describes Tang's respectable and tearful history in great detail. Zhao Xusheng, the new martial arts elder actor hired by the stage, played Tang Zhengcai and performed extremely hard. As for the role of King Xiao Chaogui of the West, Wang Huchen, the pillar of the stage, played the role, and the scene of being shot and killed in battle was more difficult and richer in national stimulation than Zhou Yu's "Woman Complain." Therefore, the seating has been quite crowded for several days.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e192">No Longer "Dissent" <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhishui</p>
<p>It's funny to say, after writing a bit of my own and submitting it to "Free Talk" for publication, I couldn't find my own piece. I didn't clip and save that day's "Free Talk". So today, after reading Mr. Huang Huaibai's "After Reading the Dissent on Creation and Time", I couldn't even pick out my own "dissent" to carefully examine it. But Mr. Huang's first article is still clipped in the pile of letters. Comparing the two, I am satisfied with Mr. Huang, because in this second article he has already said that he "never said that creation only needs sufficient time and can abandon other conditions."</p>
<p>Although rereading Mr. Huang's first article (September 17th "Creation and Time") carefully, one cannot help but say that the center of gravity of his argument is on the two words "time", and that he has ignored "other conditions", but now I am quite satisfied with Mr. Huang's argument in the second article.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Huang this time also said, "How can one only talk about 'life experience', 'observation' and 'thought' as Mr. Zhishui said, there are also 'imagination', 'emotion', and 'descriptive skills', etc., this can be appealed to 'common sense' to know". Well said, well said! Putting "imagination" and "emotion" on the list of "elements of creation" is quite old-fashioned "common sense". I don't quite trust such "common sense". I believe that "imagination" and "emotion" both start from "life experience". People with different "life experiences" often have different "imaginations" and "emotions", so it is not appropriate to put them together when discussing them. And I remember that I never put "life experience" and "observation" and "thought" together for discussion, as Mr. Huang quoted!</p>
<p>And I also don't understand why an article discussing "creation and time" would be called "digressing from the topic" if it mentioned life experience, etc.? Furthermore, because there are no good creations, "hoping that writers will not cherish time too much", and citing "historical examples" of completing a book in ten or twenty years, is it no wonder that people think the commentator is "limited to a rigid time relationship"? Therefore, I feel that my previous "dissent" was not a "purely arbitrary judgment". If Mr. Huang's first article had the same tone as his current second article, I would naturally not say that his views were limited to a rigid time relationship. Isn't this a very simple matter? Mr. Huang's first article did not imply anything about the relationship with life experience, my "dissent" raised the "relationship with life experience", so how can this be considered erasing other people's opinions?</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Huang also used Scott and Balzac, whom I cited in my "dissent", to explain that both of them were forced to overwork because of debt. It can be seen that Mr. Huang also admits that their creations did not have ten or twenty years of careful consideration. However, since Mr. Huang cannot deny that all their works are not great, then doesn't Mr. Huang's argument in the first article lightly overturn itself? Mr. Huang said in the first article that Goethe "spent a full fifty years" to complete "Faust", but this time he turned around and said "roughly so", and also said "at least eating, sleeping, reading, and talking must have taken up a part of his time", but in fact, during those "fifty years", Goethe was busy with other things besides "eating, sleeping, reading, and talking", so it's not enough to say "roughly so"; however, Mr. Huang also overturned his own argument in the first article. These are all reasons why I am satisfied with Mr. Huang's second article. I am deeply gratified that my "dissent" did not "erase other people's opinions".</p>
<p>A few final words: Mr. Huang also said in this article, "Zola's Rougon-Macquart series also took more than twenty years of effort to write"; this tone is somewhat similar to Mr. Huang's belief in "ten years, twenty years, fifty years" in his first article; but Zola's twenty years wrote a total of twenty volumes of books, each with about 200,000 words! Dividing it by the years, Zola is still not "cherishing time too much"! As for Mr. Huang's statement this time that "therefore, there are still people criticizing Scott's works for not having very real internal emotions and thoughts, and Zola also made the mistake of being lengthy in his descriptive techniques. Even these great writers inevitably have minor flaws due to their 'prolific' nature, which is even more conceivable for others." This passage is applied a little bit "out of bounds". Scott's "not very real" is because he did not use the techniques of realism, and Zola's "lengthy" is partly related to his naturalistic theory and partly because his "style" is like that, and cannot be considered a failure because of his "prolific" nature.</p>
<p>But the most interesting thing is that my "dissent" cited Scott and others who wrote a large book in one year to disagree with Mr. Huang's first article's examples of completing a book in ten years, twenty years, or fifty years. And this time, Mr. Huang conversely used the facts of Scott, etc., to "dare to say: Mr. Zhishui's cited honors of Scott, etc. in the literary world were all obtained through long-term efforts and hard work". In this way, people who only read Mr. Huang's second article will mistakenly think that I attribute the acquisition of Scott's and others' "honors" to not having gone through long-term efforts.</p>
<p>But in fact, my original statement is exactly Mr. Huang's current statement. However, Mr. Huang's first article only said that only by completing a book in ten years, twenty years, or even fifty years can it be great, while my "dissent" said that a writer who completes a book in one year can also be great, as long as his "life experience" is rich—and of course, he must also have literary cultivation. And the so-called "rich life experience" and "literary cultivation" are the so-called "long-term efforts". This "effort" cannot be rigidly estimated by the time spent writing a book.</p>
<p>If Mr. Huang did not have the idea of "abandoning other conditions" in mind when writing his first article, then the tone of his first article should be like his current second article, right? Furthermore, if he did distinguish the essential difference between "completing a book in twenty years or even fifty years" and Scott's and others' "long-term efforts and hard work" when writing his second article, then his second article might not be what it is now, right? But this is truly so-called "arbitrary judgment". Let's not say too much.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Countryside <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Living in the city, tired of hearing the noisy sounds of traffic, tired of seeing the grayness of walls and roofs, I always think of going to the countryside, but when I get to the countryside, especially the countryside with the feeling of autumn, it makes people unwilling to live there for a long time. A little rain turns the road into mud, making it difficult to set foot. Not to mention this, the sight of trees covered with old leaves in mixed yellow and green, shivering under the blowing of the cold wind, is enough to make people lose a lot of vitality.</p>
<p>Do you think you can still sit leisurely under that willow tree by the river, hugging your knees, and watch the white geese playing on the water for a while? But you always smell the scent of dog feces and the like in the half-yellow grass. When you go to a courtyard, the first thing you see is pieces of cloth stained with excrement and urine flying under the eaves. The cow tied to the tree in the courtyard may have been led away, but the cow dung and cow urine mixed with dry straw are still conspicuously left behind. When sitting on a short, squeaky stool, you have to be careful all the time that the bottom of your clothes doesn't sweep the dirty things that chickens have scattered on the ground. The dog that initially barked fiercely at you, after being scolded by its owner, tucks its tail and quiets down, and now comes over like a child and sniffs you with its nose, putting the chaff that it stole from the pig feed on your shoes.</p>
<p>"Come and see, is this house good?"</p>
<p>Following the owner in, the cobwebs hanging like tassels on the roof beams, covered with dust, have been swept away and can no longer be seen. You can barely live in it, but looking out from the windows made of a few branches, under the mulberry tree with leaves fluttering in the wind, there are two huge manure vats placed askew. Thinking about it, let's pull the clumsy wooden door on the window, which is slightly coated with a bit of yellow tung oil, to close it, but the room will be completely dark, and you need a Western candle to read. More particular families may have one or two pieces of glass tile installed on the low tile roof, but they are either gray and blurry, or a little dark yellow, and it is also not certain that there are three or five yellow leaves piled on top.</p>
<p>Who can go to the countryside near Shanghai to rent a farmhouse and not get such an impression?</p>
<p>However, the countryside seen from the car window, boat window, or horseback is good and full of poetry. However, if you do not have the determination and courage to "improve the countryside" or "go to the people", but just return to the countryside to eat old rice and live day by day, it is really unbearable for people who are used to walking on asphalt roads and using electric lights and running water. What's more, today's countryside is collapsing in a mess.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of a farmer who lives in the countryside for a long time, there is no such gentlemanly disgust for the countryside. As long as there is no knocking on the door to collect taxes and rent, no conscription, and no endless wars, then even living in the same house with cattle and eating at a table with a chicken coop underneath is quite satisfactory. But in fact, they are forced to leave, forever leaving their familiar and lovely countryside. Now the countryside has become uninhabitable for the people of the countryside. How can intellectuals who love the countryside not hate it?</p>
<p>Therefore, people who want to "go to the people" today need as much courage as going to the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Night Walk <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Unintentionally, I slipped into the market far away from my residence before dusk. There, unintentionally, I picked up a few broken books with all the money I had at the book stall. When I walked out the door, I was met by a friend who looked like an old brother, and it was so unintentional!</p>
<p>As we talked, I was invited into a theater. Let the buried theater addiction open its eyes again.</p>
<p>After the crowd dispersed, I went to the parking lot to pick up my bicycle. There was no light on the bicycle. To avoid being out at night, I don't usually leave it on the bike.</p>
<p>"It's not okay without a light!"</p>
<p>"It's okay, the weather is clear, it's good if it doesn't rain. I'll buy another one after I pass by the bicycle shop." The ground is slightly damp, it's a road, and the ditches on both sides are flowing like small rivers while swallowing. This sound reminds me of the endless flowing water in front of my house in Jiangnan. Don't many people envy the small bridge and flowing water?</p>
<p>But now I am far away in my hometown across thousands of mountains and rivers!</p>
<p>"Let's go," I muttered to myself after seeing the well-meaning middle-aged man walk away. I touched my pocket, it was empty.</p>
<p>I walked closely to the left, like a thief in the middle of the night, trying to dodge the sight of the police. They would interfere, especially to save electricity and rickshaw fare. They are often harshly scolded to stop until they turn on the lights.</p>
<p>I stepped on the pedals hard, letting the bicycle glide quickly, my heart was beating slightly. There were so many police stations! There was a black uniform standing underneath.</p>
<p>Too bad he doesn't have eyes on all sides. I smiled secretly, seeing that I had escaped the first police station, the black uniform was facing away from me.</p>
<p>I borrowed the light from other bicycles along the way, following closely. As soon as I got to a police station, I slanted to the side, it was best to have the ability to be invisible! Raindrops leaked from the trees with dense leaves one after another on the side of the street, passing through my hair, my head was strangely cool, and my hands and sleeves were also full of cool drips.</p>
<p>"Turn on the lights, female cyclist, that female cyclist!" Finally, I was caught.</p>
<p>"Ignore him, the cat catches the mouse!" I silently glided past again.</p>
<p>I was shouted at again and again, and I was almost detained. I was defeated, okay, I surrender. I got off the bicycle and pushed it on the sidewalk. The big lamp in front of the Palace Museum was shining brightly. I haven't been there yet, it costs half a dollar to see the gate all the way. I only cared about looking around, and I kept stepping on mud pits under my feet. Water got into the seams of my leather shoes and soaked my feet. It was even more difficult when I entered the alley. People say that the alleys in Peiping are three feet of dust without wind, that may be a bit of a lie, but three inches of mud on rainy days is indeed true. Several times, my feet were as difficult to pull out as if they were stuck in a small pot. I arrived at the steps of my residence. My feet looked like pine blossoms covered with yellow soil.</p>
<p>In the small alley, the vendor selling hard noodles was shouting, his voice was so lonely. The basket on his back looked very heavy. On a rainy day, where would there be buyers? Thank you for his hand-held lamp, which illuminated the door knocker I was knocking on.</p>

<p>— By Langston Hughes, Translated by Fo Lang</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In the reception room of the Overseas Merchants' Hotel, there were six large brass spittoons – one in each corner, one in the middle, and one placed near the registration clerk's desk. Xin Di's job was to clean these spittoons. Every winter evening, after school, he would run into the hotel through the back door, put his books in the cupboard where he kept his broom and rag, sweep the two small dining rooms, dust the stairs and the reception room, then take these spittoons and pour the viscous phlegm into the alley, rinse them with water, and polish them until they shone as if they were made of gold. Apart from the slight odor during cleaning, Xin Di rather liked this job. He often felt very proud that around six o'clock, he could see the six formerly phlegm-filled but now shining spittoons in the dirty old reception room, reflecting the electric lights, all done by his own hands and with the help of polishing oil to increase their shine, which never failed to please Xin Di.</p>
<p>He liked cleaning things, making them beautiful and shiny, just like his old grandmother, Hager: when she wasn't doing laundry, she would often sweep the house, wipe the stairs, or scrub the kitchen floor until it was clean enough. Granny Hager found cleaned things beautiful, and so did Xin Di. Every evening, he was proud of his six clean brass spittoons. Although every day when he came to work, they were refilled with tobacco juice, cigarette butts, gum residue, and phlegm, it was Xin Di's job to clean them – and when they were cleaned, they were beautiful again.</p>
<p>Cha Xiang Na Tuo was right: this job wasn't too difficult, and he liked that it only took a little time. He was interested and fascinated by the new life he saw in the hotel, but he was a quiet child by nature, and he didn't have many questions to ask. No one told him anything except his work supervisor. Xin Di swept well, and the head waiter never had a chance to scold him, because he was always scolding the two bellhop boys.</p>
<p>The Overseas Merchants' Hotel wasn't a large hotel, nor was it a refined one. It was a three-story building, already dilapidated and about to collapse, and hadn't been painted for many years. In the reception room, two large glass windows looked out onto the street, and in front of them were rows of hardwood chairs. At the back of the reception room was the registration clerk's desk, a box of cigars and cigarettes, a pot of cold water, and a door leading to the men's restroom, cleaning which was also Xin Di's responsibility.</p>
<p>Upstairs on the second and third floors were the bedrooms. Only very poor traveling salesmen and temporary railroad workers frequented them, and occasionally some performers, and street women and their patrons rented them. The Overseas Merchants' Hotel was often busiest in the evenings, but only on Saturdays. That night, Xin Di's work started after six o'clock and he couldn't go home until ten or eleven, but his grandmother Hager was always waiting for him, warming the fire and filling a bucket of water for his once-a-week bath.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Germany Reforms Education System <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>School lessons from Monday to Friday</p>
<p>Saturday for Hitler Youth training</p>
<p>National teachers study various issues</p>
<p>Teachers without achievements in cooperation groups will be disqualified</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) According to German education expert Xisheng's interview with reporters, Sweden is the most outstanding example of a modern education system because it can use new methods to improve previous deficiencies in order to meet needs. Germany is now actively improving its education, and the educational policies it has set are attracting the attention of educators around the world and are considered to be of great value. The German education system involves a kind of competition between schools, the Hitler Youth, and parents, resulting in different perspectives on implementing educational plans, which is very inconsistent with educational principles.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Minister's Proposal <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>German Education Minister Rustling believes that this inconsistent and deformed educational method is very detrimental to young people, so he resolutely improved the proposed plan to be simple and easy to implement. He changed the weekly coursework into three sections: from Monday to Friday for school lessons, and Saturday as a school holiday, purely for Hitler Youth training, gathering male and female students together to travel to the countryside further away from the city, seeking a natural life and thereby exercising the body. Sunday is entirely for family life. Since its implementation, education has been unified and the results have been remarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Extending Summer Vacation <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Not only that, but Rustling also stipulated a simple and effective method for training, which is to shorten the autumn and winter vacations and extend the summer vacation to five school terms. During this period, all teachers must receive considerable new education training. Every summer, teachers, regardless of age, must join cooperation groups to jointly study various issues related to the spirit and physical aspects of the new German citizens, so as to provide the new knowledge gained to the youth they approach, striving to achieve the goal of being role models for young people.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Examining Teachers <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Rustling's most pertinent statement quotes doctors, who diligently study new treatment methods for patients. In the future, teachers should also continuously and tirelessly study the implementation of education, and should not assume that they have achieved great success after passing the national teaching examination and no longer seek further study. The mission of the cooperation group focuses on testing teachers' abilities and knowledge to guide young people, to see if they can truly handle the job. If teachers do not achieve satisfactory results in the Saturday cooperation group, their teaching qualifications will be revoked. From this emphasis on education, one can see a glimpse of the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Eleven Counties in Zhejiang's Tai and Yan Prefectures Request Disaster Relief for Education Expenses <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Ninth School District Guidance Conference held its seventh Guidance Conference and the second meeting of the Executive Committee at the Yanzhong Affiliated Elementary School. Zhang Lingti, Chairman of Yanzhong Affiliated Elementary School, presided over the meeting and passed many proposals. The most important one was the proposal on how to provide disaster relief for education funds in the province's school district. It was decided to send a telegram to the Education Department for disaster relief. The original telegram is as follows: To the esteemed Education Department of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou. We have investigated that the education funds in six counties, including Jiande, in the province's Ninth School District have always been exhausted. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been no rain for three months, and the disaster situation is extremely serious. The rural economy has completely collapsed, tax sources have almost been cut off, and it is difficult to collect school rent. The directors of the education bureaus in each county have already been left with more heart than power, and the education cause is about to come to a standstill. Our office, witnessing this tragic situation, dares not remain silent. Therefore, we convened an executive meeting on the date of this document and decided to ask the Education Department to provide disaster relief. For this reason, we specifically telegraph to earnestly request the Education Department to quickly provide disaster relief to help us through this difficult time. The education system will be very fortunate, and the region will be very fortunate.</p>
<p>Another report states that the directors of the education bureaus of six counties, including the former Tai and Zeng Huang, held a meeting at Haimen Taizhou Middle School to discuss how to provide emergency relief for the shortage of more than 160,000 yuan in education expenses. It was decided to submit the above-mentioned shortage amount to the Provincial Government's Finance and Education Departments to allocate funds from local public bonds and tobacco and alcohol license tax stamp duties. It was also decided that the directors of the education bureaus of each county would go to the province by car from Tiantai on the 16th to request assistance from the authorities.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Education Department, in order to train students in each school, should use the implementation of the New Life Movement as a standard, specially ordered and promulgated the following implementation plan and ordered all schools to comply. The following is an excerpt from the original document: (A) Implementation Principles: (1) Each school should use the implementation of the New Life Movement as a standard for training students. (2) Each school should implement the New Life Movement to enable students to express propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in their daily lives, clothing, food, and actions, so that spiritual life and material life are combined into one. (B) Implementation Methods: (1) New Life training should be implemented from the following two aspects: A. Public training, with four items omitted. B. Individual training, with five items. (C) Examples of New Life Standards for Students, with thirteen items and one hundred and ten sub-items. Note: Each school should formulate implementation measures for the New Life Movement based on this plan and submit them to the Education Department for record and implementation.</p>

<p>The Chinese Education Society has been established for more than a year. Because the membership qualifications are very strict and the introductions and selections are very precise, only more than 300 members have been absorbed so far. More than 20 branch societies have been established in various places, and they are studying matters that should be promoted and reformed in education. The society's affairs are quite developed. Recently, it was heard that in order to enrich the internal organization, in addition to having each director and alternate director voluntarily become permanent individual members to promote this, they also increased the number of provincial and municipal education departments and universities as group members. They have already received enthusiastic replies agreeing to join. The society has now revised the group membership fees at the third board meeting to be (1) 200 yuan for a one-time payment, and (2) 50 yuan for an annual payment. Members can choose one of the two.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the suggestion of the Anqing branch, the society will contact the former China Education Improvement Society to use the books, address, and funds stored by the society in Beiping. It was also decided to invite five members, including Jiang Menglin, Zhang Boling, Chang Daozhi, Yang Chuan, and Tao Zhihang, to negotiate the acquisition.</p>

<p>Inspects Ping and Ji provinces this year, and will inspect Shandong Province next year</p>
<p>Zhong Daozan, Supervisor and Section Chief of the Education Department, went to Beiping to inspect vocational education. Due to the hardships of travel, he suffered from an eye disease (sudden dilation of the pupil) upon arrival in Beiping and moved into Tongren Hospital. Cha Yuan, Director of the Beiping Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the Education Department to explain everything (the treatment and operation by the doctor were successful, but he still needs to recuperate). The Education Department also telegraphed Liu Mingquan, an employee of the Education Department's archive storage office in Beiping, instructing him to take care of him nearby. Yesterday, Mr. Mingquan telegraphed on behalf of the Education Department, briefly stating that Supervisor Zhong instructed that due to his eye disease, he had to reduce the inspection area and planned to complete the inspection of vocational education in Beiping and Hebei first, and return to the Education Department at the end of next month. Regarding vocational education in Shandong Province, he plans to inspect it next year.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Outlets for Graduates of Yangzhou High School <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School has always enjoyed a good reputation. The outlets for its graduates are of great interest to the general public. It has been discovered that the statistics for the ordinary graduates of the school this year are as follows: Five people were admitted to the Tianchu Han Education Foundation (more than 100 middle school students across the country applied, and a total of 10 were selected, with the school accounting for half of them). Two people were admitted to the Liang Shiyi Scholarship, one person was admitted to the Wang Boyuan Scholarship, 19 people were admitted to National Central University, 18 people were admitted to Tsinghua University, 15 people were admitted to Shanghai Jiaotong University, 11 people were admitted to the Central Political School, 5 people were admitted to Peking University, 4 people were admitted to Wuhan University, 4 people were admitted to Beiping Normal University, and 2 people were admitted to Zhejiang University. In addition, one person each was admitted to Jinling, Shandong, Shanghai Business College, and Merchant Marine schools. Two people were admitted to Shanghai Bank. All of this year's graduates have gone on to further education. Among the 64 ordinary graduates of the school last year, only one failed to graduate. This year, among the 78 graduates, only one failed to graduate because he scored more than 50 points in the geography subject. Therefore, the school's performance is ranked first in the province. In addition, all 23 graduates of the civil engineering department this year have not gone on to further education or been unemployed, but have all served in the engineering field. Fourteen people serve in engineering institutions in the province, and nine people serve in engineering institutions in other provinces. Various parties are still competing to hire them, and there is a great shortage of supply. In addition, all the normal school graduates this year have taken elementary school teaching positions. Among them, nine people applied for elementary school teachers in Nanjing City, and eight were admitted. It is heard that the total number of applicants was more than 360, and only 18 were admitted in total, while 8 out of 9 applicants from the school were admitted, almost half of the total number of admissions. In addition, the school's junior high school graduates participated in the provincial ordinary department, grade statistics entrance examination this year. According to the Education Department's statistics, its performance is also the best in the province.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Answering Mr. Liu Yizheng for "Wonderful Plan to Protect the Nose" (1) Zhu Yixin <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Not long ago, I compiled a set of elementary school Chinese textbooks for the World Book Bureau. In the first volume, lessons six and seven selected "Wonderful Plan to Protect the Nose." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a king who was very tyrannical. One day, he was going to pass through a certain city. The people in the city got the news and were very panicked, because if the king entered the city, the food and drink of his retinue would have to be supplied by them. If the king saw anything they loved, he would take it away. So they gathered the masses to discuss how to prevent the king from entering the city.</p>
<p>A clever man suggested, "We should cut down the big trees in the forest and place the tree trunks and branches across the road to prevent the king from entering the city." When the crowd heard this, they all clapped their hands in approval. Soon, they blocked all the roads around the city with wood.</p>
<p>The king wanted to enter the city, but seeing that all the roads, big and small, were impassable, he had to change his route. Before leaving, he said to a villager, "Go and tell the people in the city that sooner or later I will send troops into the city and cut off their noses."</p>
<p>The villager immediately rushed to the city and reported what the king said. The people in the city panicked again. They immediately gathered all the old and young people in the city to discuss how to protect their noses.</p>
<p>During the meeting, everyone discussed for a long time but had no plan. Just as they were at a loss, a young man said, "Since we used wisdom to prevent the king from entering the city, we should also use wisdom to protect our noses. I think when the king sends troops, he will first capture the clever people, so we only need to pretend to be fools." Everyone thought it was a good idea, so they decided to pretend to be fools and do foolish things.</p>
<p>The king returned to the palace feeling very unhappy. He immediately sent a team of strong soldiers on fast horses to the city to carry out his orders.</p>
<p>The soldiers arrived outside the city and saw several old men carrying stones to the mountains. The officer reined in his horse and asked, "What are you doing carrying stones to the mountains?" They said, "We are making the mountain higher so that the sun will rise earlier." The officer laughed and said, "You fools, the time of sunrise is entirely controlled by nature and doesn't require you to think about it." The old men did not believe the officer and continued to carry stones without stopping. (To be continued)</p>

<p>At 6 o'clock last night, the Jincheng Bank basketball team met the Baofeng team for the second time in the Erjin Tournament.

Then, Jincheng also launched a large-scale attack. Yao, Lou and other generals formed a unified force, passing the ball east and west, scoring repeatedly. As a result, with a score of 67 to 8, Jincheng won a great victory. The list of the two teams is listed below.</p>

<p>Today's Battle Against Dasha</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Art School volleyball team has won all the games since coming to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the team played against Jiaotong University at the school's court. Although the Art School players had experienced hundreds of hardships, they showed no signs of fatigue. Their spirits were high, making people expect them to be veterans of the battlefield. In the exchanges between the two sides, the Art School took the lead. Although Jiaotong University's third-row defense skills were experienced, it was a pity that the first two rows lacked spiking generals, so there were fewer chances of winning. The three rows of the Art School were skilled in passing, and the spiking of the first two rows was stable, and they finally won three consecutive games with scores of 21 to 17, 20 to 12, and 21 to 14. The list of the two teams is listed below.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Eternally Relieving Suffering, Showing Pity for a Young Girl at the Door; Hearing of Hardships, Cherishing Heaven, Visiting a Home</p>
<p>The teahouse attendant said: When people reach the point of selling their sons and daughters, they prioritize satisfying their hunger first. They can't concern themselves with other things. During the great drought years ago, tens of thousands of women from Shaanxi married into Shanxi. The deal was agreed upon one day, and they left the next. Who could worry about what happened afterward? We only heard that disaster victims got married and left, but we never heard of them returning. Take the young girl who just came, for example. Even if her two generations above were willing to sell her, it wouldn't be easy to find a patron. Cheng Zhiqian said: Her two generations above probably just wanted to find a place to eat, so they'd just casually find a son-in-law. Why would they need to sell this child to someone as a concubine? The teahouse attendant laughed: Mr. Cheng, think about it. Those without money can't afford her; they still have to support two generations. Those with money wouldn't legitimately marry a refugee girl. Cheng Zhiqian nodded, seemingly agreeing with what he said, and slowly paced back and forth under the eaves, pondering the attendant's words. Suddenly, he smiled: I remembered a saying. He turned around to look at the teahouse attendant. The teahouse attendant laughed: Mr. Cheng, if you want this girl, it's easy to arrange. I can run errands for you. Cheng Zhiqian shook his head repeatedly and laughed: No, no. It's what you said to the girl just now, that there are foreign cave dwellings behind. I don't understand that. Cave dwellings are unique to the Northwest, so how can they be related to the word "foreign"? What kind of style are the foreign cave dwellings you're talking about? The teahouse attendant laughed: Saying they're foreign-style just means the cave dwellings are well-made. There aren't any cave dwellings there. Cheng Zhiqian said: I've visited the cave dwellings all the way from Luoyang to Xi'an. The worst ones are just like animal dens. You can't even stand up straight when you enter. It's pitch black inside. You can touch the dirt on the cave walls. There are all kinds of smells inside, but nothing else. (43)</p>

<p>Do you know what kind of people the eunuchs of the former Qing dynasty were? I'm sure many people will answer: prostitutes, actors, slaves, soldiers, etc. Haha, wrong! In the former Qing dynasty, those qualified to be eunuchs were not ordinary commoners, but Manchu officials. Their eunuch status was absolute and genuine, without any doubt. Originally, they called themselves "eunuchs" in front of the emperor, without anyone else calling them that. They acknowledged it themselves first.</p>
<p>In the "Record of Fragrant Clouds" recently published in this newspaper, it was mentioned that Yuan Shikai, when meeting the Empress Dowager, called himself a "eunuch." A few days later, there was an addendum stating that a certain gentleman had submitted a letter correcting that Han officials should call themselves "subjects," etc. I remember hearing my late father talk about this anecdote when I was about eleven or twelve years old. Now, I can take this opportunity to discuss it. I haven't studied history, so I don't know if this matter is recorded in official history. I don't know if there are any mistakes. I'll ignore those for now.</p>
<p>The Great Qing Code was compiled by Hong Chengchou, a leftover official from the late Ming dynasty. At the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Qing court greatly valued Hong's talent and wanted to force him to surrender. They used mansions and beauties to soften him. However, Hong refused to submit and later resolved to starve himself to death for his former country, drinking only plain water to quench his thirst. How strange! After half a month of starvation, Hong not only survived but also looked better. He couldn't help but sigh that it was Heaven's will that he couldn't uphold his foolish loyalty! He finally shed tears, bowed to the north to bid farewell to his former lord in Heaven, and surrendered to the Qing court. It turned out that the Qing court learned of Hong's hunger strike and was awed by his loyalty. They were also reluctant to lose his great talent, so they secretly ordered the people serving him to mix ginseng soup into the water he drank, so he didn't die. This little trick allowed him to be fooled greatly!</p>
<p>After Hong Chengchou was ordered to compile the Great Qing Code, he also took the opportunity to play tricks, as if he was intentionally retaliating, and he also fooled the Manchus. He included a clause in the Great Qing Rituals: "Whenever officials have an audience or make a report to the emperor, Manchu officials should call themselves 'eunuchs,' and Han officials should call themselves 'subjects.'" This clearly taught Manchu officials to willingly equate themselves with slaves. Later, some less foolish Manchu officials vaguely realized that this "calling oneself a eunuch" was not very dignified. However, this had already become an ancestral custom, as fixed as iron, and could not be changed!</p>
<p>Now, twenty years after the Qing dynasty abdicated, the deposed emperor, who used to be the master, is unexpectedly being manipulated and enslaved by the Japanese. There is even a group of new and old Manchu and Han servants who are gloatingly acting as eunuchs of eunuchs. This downward trend is something Hong Chengchou could never have anticipated back then!</p>

<p>Shandong has no tigers, Zhejiang has no wolves, Shandong has no rabbits, and Western Sichuan has no pigeons.</p>
<p>Owls eat their mothers, elaphure eat their fathers, mosquitoes are called white birds, and fireflies are called red birds.</p>
<p>Huge things eat dogs, cuckoos eat mulberries, cats eat lotuses, all of which are recorded in [unclear]; tigers are named Li Er. When tigers eat livestock, they never eat the ears, which is said to be because they avoid their name. Only the [unclear] eats one person, but only lacks one ear. I have been thinking about this to this day and cannot figure out the reason. I record this to provide for the research of biologists.</p>

<p>— Zhu Shoutong</p>
<p>What a delightful thing! During this bitter rain, a crescent moon emerges from the thin clouds.</p>
<p>The clear and gentle light, like the fingers of a loving mother, caresses the window curtains, caresses the flowers in the vase on the table, slowly approaches and caresses my messy hair, then quietly moves past, caressing everything else. The small building is everywhere, melting into the embrace of nature. I am also intoxicated by it.</p>
<p>Outside the window, a sycamore tree along the street, with a full head of green leaves, sways its branches, as if nodding and smiling. The moonlight reflects the shadow of the tree, spreading all over the window, the floor, and the walls, all covered with natural patterns and colors, sparse and rhythmic, which no one can write to such mystery. The sound of a piano accompanied by the bells of Van Gogh floats into the room from time to time. It must be a Swenade melody, so subtle, so charming, and all the worries are dissipated to who knows where.</p>
<p>The leaves on the branches rustle, and a few tender green autumn insects are blown in by a slight autumn breeze. They fall to the ground and jump around non-stop as if afraid of people. I remember when I had insomnia, I relied on their chirping to pass the long, boring nights. Now that we meet by chance, let's stay in the room with these guests living under someone else's roof and spend this cool autumn night together.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Perming Hair <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixin</p>
<p>From the bright and sparkling mirror, my withered and thin face is reflected. The hardships of life are clearly symbolized by such a face.</p>
<p>My scattered and unruly hair is about to be tamed by hot tongs heated with an alcohol lamp. It will be divided into batches, smoothed out, and pressed down. Each time the tongs touch my hair, it is a time of oppression. The sound of the hair sizzling is a pitiful whisper that continuously spreads, tensing and trembling all the muscles in my body. Sometimes, the oppression is so strong and severe that even my skin suffers innocent pain.</p>
<p>What a foolish thing this is! My hair is naturally healthy, yet I forcibly and aggressively try to make it beautiful by conforming to an unnatural standard. Why bother? Doesn't natural beauty exist?</p>
<p>This small matter—perming hair—has left me with so much stimulation and enlightenment. It has clearly shown me that in today's world, peace, disarmament, and everything else are nothing more than hypocrisy covered by a mask. The hair, after being forcibly pressed by hot tongs, isn't it as docile and obedient as a lamb? Only the strong can stand on the victorious battle line. I am also secretly reflecting that the countryside has collapsed to such a depressed state, but I am still so indifferent. Isn't this too unpatriotic of me? Perhaps the main reason is that I am too estranged from the countryside.</p>

<p>— Zhu Jin</p>
<p>Autumn is gradually deepening. The fashionable men and women in the city have all changed into new clothes; especially the young ladies. Some are wearing light yellow short jackets, some are wearing colorful scarves, and the cheongsams with beautiful curves are of course graceful and lovely; while a group of students in short skirts and chubby legs are also full of healthy charm. In Mr. Wu's eyes, he really feels that other people's clothes are too outdated, at least they are old-fashioned clothes that can be sold in a clothing store.</p>
<p>On this day, Mr. Wu finally received his salary, which had been discounted by 20%. In his dry pocket, he carried a crisp five-yuan banknote from the Bank of China, and six silver dollars. The slight clinking sound of the silver dollars shaking made Mr. Wu feel much more energetic. He puffed out his chest and walked on the sidewalk, looking at the women and listening to the wonderfully sung radio, truly feeling boundless joy, floating as if in paradise.</p>
<p>"Hairy crabs for sale, hairy crabs for sale." The gentle voice of the crab seller, and the fist-sized hairy crabs with a bluish-brown color in the small basket, entered Mr. Wu's eyes and ears, and his heart couldn't help but stir.</p>
<p>Crabs are Mr. Wu's favorite food, but he has been separated from them for a long time. On this day, because he had sixteen dollars in his pocket, he wanted to reward himself with a few crabs for a big feast. So he stopped the crab seller and asked him how much they cost per catty.</p>
<p>"Sir, I don't cheat customers; others sell for one dollar for one and a half catties, but for you, sir, I'll give you ten taels per dollar per catty." The high price made Mr. Wu start calculating in his mind. Each crab weighs at least five taels, according to the current market weight of thirteen taels and six mace, it would cost more than one dollar to buy six crabs. If he uses one dollar to buy food, it can last for at least five days. Mr. Wu thought about the food problem, and then about the rent, and about his wife's autumn clothes. Everything, everything, finally suppressed his appetite, and he hurried home.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Wu stepped into the door, his wife was busily playing mahjong with his younger sister and two neighbors. In the small living room, a mahjong table and four chairs were placed diagonally, leaving almost no room to move. Mr. Wu felt a slight sense of melancholy in his heart; in such an environment, his wife still wants to play mahjong, it seems too inconsiderate of him. However, when he saw his wife's yellow face and outdated clothes, he felt that it would be too unfeeling not to let his wife enjoy these small pleasures; besides, the mahjong his wife plays is the smallest kind, with a base of one thousand cash.</p>
<p>However, in this noisy environment, Mr. Wu certainly couldn't do anything in the living room; in the room, the light was too dim, and it wasn't even convenient to read. Finally, Mr. Wu lay down on the bed, wanting to take a nap, but because of the rumbling and clattering of the mahjong tiles and the sounds of his wife's laughter and curses, Mr. Wu not only couldn't sleep, but the thoughts in his heart were stirred up like raging waves.</p>
<p>He thought of his former large family, with high halls and large houses, but now he lived in a low house no different from a doorman's room; and after so many years of struggle and hard work, although he could barely maintain his life, not to mention rising to prominence, there was no hope at all. Even to slightly improve his environment seemed beyond his ability. The ambition of his youth to make a grand career completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The rumbling and clattering of the mahjong tiles, one sound after another, entered Mr. Wu's ears, like exploding bombs, really making Mr. Wu's head swell and his heart vexed. So, because of the bad environment, Mr. Wu also hated the low house, and even hated his wife's mischief. The bursts of annoyance made Mr. Wu unable to rest on the bed.</p>
<p>He suddenly sat up and rushed to the living room with a fierce look. The pale face made everyone at the mahjong table stop laughing and silently shuffle the tiles. His wife's face also turned from yellow to pale, frighteningly, which couldn't help but suppress Mr. Wu's anger. When he looked at her old-fashioned clothes again, his heart was pounding, and he couldn't get angry. So he took out all sixteen dollars from his pocket and threw them in front of his wife, and then stepped out the door in a daze. The vast twilight gradually swallowed Mr. Wu's back.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 16 The Empress Dowager Arrives Safely in Her Hometown</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the three northeastern provinces, due to the influence of inspiration, it seemed that the air had changed to a different atmosphere from before; looking outside the car again, the scenery of the fields also seemed a little different. However, if you really asked me to point out what the specific differences were, I wouldn't be able to answer! In short, this kind of feeling happens naturally whenever we first enter a strange place. At that time, our train seemed to be running much faster than usual, probably because it had been forced to roll slowly all the way, and it was also a little unhappy itself.</p>
<p>There is a kind of plant in the three northeastern provinces; it is very famous, and perhaps people from all over the world know about it, that is "gaoliang" (sorghum). I had also heard of it for a long time, but had never seen it before; so after leaving Shanhaiguan, whenever I had time, I leaned against the car window and tried my best to look out, but I didn't see any special plants for a long time. Finally, I went to ask the eunuch who was well-versed in botany, and he pointed it out to me with a smile. It turned out that the gaoliang had not yet grown at that time, and was only one or two feet long after sprouting, so when I saw it, I thought it was wheat! It is said that after a few more months, these gaoliang will grow as tall as a person, and its leaves are very dense, and many families grow it; therefore, when they grow up, from Shanhaiguan in the west to the border of Goryeo in the east, this entire area is simply like being covered with a green velvet carpet. When people look down from a higher place, they only see a piece of green, and all the smaller houses, streams, ponds, and other plants are all covered by the gaoliang and cannot be seen at all! Therefore, people in the three northeastern provinces often call that period the period when the "green gauze curtain" rises. (153)</p>

<p>Short Sellers Suffer, Longs Rejoice</p>
<p>Since the increase in export tax on silver, followed by the imposition of a balancing tax, the foreign exchange market suddenly became tight, people's hearts turned firm, and prices soared, the momentum of which was unprecedented. In order to let readers understand the actual situation of the price increase, we will compare the market prices on the day before the announcement of the silver tax (the 13th) (the 14th was a Sunday and the market was closed, the 15th was the announcement of the tax increase) with yesterday's market prices. During these four days, the prices rose day after day, and the increase was truly astonishing. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>Highest Reached 1020 Yuan</p>
<p>Resulting in an Increase of 52.7 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the outflow of silver was stopped and the buying spree was repeatedly stirred up, the gold market was even worse yesterday, rising to 1020 yuan before slightly stabilizing. However, the underlying trend remained bullish. Although there were people trying to suppress the price, people were not very optimistic. In the morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and the United States both fell sharply, with London spot gold falling by one penny. The exchange rate fluctuated slightly, and the US protest note to China regarding silver for gold had been announced. The other side seemed to agree with the idea of exchanging gold for silver, which was reported in the newspapers. People's sentiment was not affected at all. The outside market opened at 66-67 yuan, and the buying spree suddenly intensified. There was no supply, and the price rose to 80 yuan. After the opening, the Central Bank announced its listed prices, with British currency down 875, US currency down 1.8125, and customs gold surging 9.2 points. The standard gold price was increased to 989 yuan, boosting people's sentiment and causing the price to rise. However, because the Central Bank was still selling shillings, it still hesitated. The Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank announced its listed prices, with British currency down half a penny and US currency down 1.125, making the buying spree even fiercer. In a blink of an eye, it broke through the 1000 yuan mark. At this point, the buyers became even more enthusiastic. The market was short of supply, and large institutions came in to buy, making the market even tighter. The British exchange rate had fallen to one shilling and four pence, and the US exchange rate was also tight, to within 32 yuan, but the banks were still unable to supply. The Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices showed another decline, and in that instant, a peak of 1020 yuan was created. The ferocity of the surge can be imagined. Afterwards, those who supplied at high prices poured in, and Bao Fang (sellers) dared to show their faces, and the price fell. However, there was no lack of rebounding forces along the way, and the market price was very volatile. Afterwards, the domestic market turned firm, but retreated into the 1000 yuan mark. At this time, the market situation was relatively weak, but after the Chinese merchants got together, the domestic market was still dry, and the banks still found it difficult to supply in large quantities. Soon, it turned tight again. In addition, the Central Bank was counter-selling shillings, which boosted people's sentiment again, and the price gradually rebounded. At one point in the morning, it rebounded to outside 1010 yuan, but large institutions were willing to supply at high prices, and at noon, it retreated back into the 1000 yuan mark. Rumors started again, actually because there was a rumor that the balanced exchange rate being discussed by the Chinese banking community would be successful. Generally, people thought that someone would again suppress the gold market on a large scale. The market was flat in the afternoon. Soon, because scattered short positions were still being covered and the longs were still holding on, it broke through the 1000 yuan mark again. Chinese merchants continued to gather together, and because the banks were still selling, they struggled at the 1000 yuan mark. Later, the banks found it difficult to cope again, and the domestic market turned tight. The gold market then broke out of the 10 yuan mark, but the market price was volatile. Large institutions sold slightly at high prices, and the exchange rate supply tended to be tight, and then downstream, but the overall trend remained firm. Finally, it closed with floating short positions. Under the impetus of buying sentiment, a certain retail investor painfully covered his short positions, and the market closed with an odd bullish sentiment. After the close, it was once pushed up to above 25 yuan, and the Guangdong bankers supplied at high prices, retreating to around 10 yuan. The market situation was increasingly chaotic throughout the day, and the surge became more and more intense, which was due to the thin strength of the maintainers and the difficulty in establishing people's faith. The buying sentiment was stimulated and even worse. In addition, at this time when domestic silver prices fell and the silver content was reduced, rumors arose from time to time. The gold market and other markets naturally had more buyers who kept buying and the longs continued to hold on. The short squeeze is bound to continue to be fierce. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 97 yuan and a half, up 15 yuan and 20 cents from the previous close. The market was chaotic, but because Heng Yu advanced, it gradually rose from 7 yuan and a half. The Central Bank's listed price was extremely expensive. Fuxing, Yongshun, Mao, Hengyu, Xianghe advanced, rising to 86 yuan. Yuanchun, Fuyu, Yuanchang, Yongheng, and Dingchang sold their positions, gradually falling back. Hua Bi offered December US dollars at 33.625 yuan, and the Central Bank sold January shillings at half a penny, causing the price to fall to 80 yuan. Da Fa, Yong, Xing, Yong, Zhaofeng, Chang, Da Chang, and Xiang still advanced, and the price was pushed up to 6 yuan again. Dadecheng, Yuan Mao, and Yongda Kang unloaded their positions, and the price fell back to 79 yuan. Dingchang, Dafa, Yongheng, Yu, Qianchang, and Xiang all advanced. The Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices showed British currency down half a penny and US currency down 1.125, and the price rose to 86 yuan again. Fu Chang found it difficult to sell, and the price fell to 3 yuan. Afterwards, the domestic market became even tighter, and the January US dollar was difficult to settle at 25. Tianfeng, Hengyu, Shengda, Yuanchang, Yongfu, Anheng, Xingyuan, Qing, Yugan, Changxiang, Yuqing, and Yongyuan Xing, and other old buyers, stirred up a buying spree and broke through the 1000 yuan mark, rising to 1004 yuan. Yuanxing and Fu Anheng sold at 1 yuan, but because large institutions such as Yuan Yi, Heng Xingyuan, Heng Yu, Heng Chang, Yong Da, Chang Xiang, and Xianghe were all competing to buy, there was a lack of capital, and the Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices showed a further decline of two and a half pennies for British currency and half a yuan for US currency, making the short squeeze even fiercer. In an instant, the price was pushed up to 1020 yuan. Heng Xing and Fu Chang were able to say high prices. The price fell back to 11 yuan. Yu Da's fund-raising, and then rose to 19 yuan. Qing Fa, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Fuxing, and Yongyuanxing all sold, and the January US dollar came out at 31.9375 yuan, falling to 07 yuan. Qing Na slightly, and then raised to 12 yuan, but Xing Da, Fa, Yong, Yi, and Feng Yong all unloaded their positions. Mai Jia Li sold January US dollars at 8125, retreating to 06 yuan. Heng Xingyuan and Heng Yu advanced again at low prices, and the exchange rate tightened again, rebounding to 12 and a half yuan. Citibank sold January US dollars at 75 and British currency at 3 pence 3125. De Qing, Li, Yifeng, Yongda, Fa, Yongheng, Yu Qing, and Yong all repeatedly unloaded their positions, gradually retreating to the 1000 yuan mark, falling to 995 and a half yuan. Dadecheng and Da Shang advanced, once rebounding to 1002 yuan. The domestic market loosened slightly. Dafa, Yongqianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Fuxing Yongqingyu, and others jointly supplied, and for a time, supply exceeded demand. The exact gold price sold December British currency at 8125, falling to 991 yuan. Yuqing Yongfuxing Yonghengxing came to advance, rising to 8 yuan. Kang Dingxing Dadecheng still sold, retreating to 2 yuan, but the exchange rate was still difficult to match. Senchang Yongyicheng Hengxing Yifeng Yongdadafa Yong and other positions advanced, and rose to 1007 yuan and a half. Yuqing Yong sold positions, retreating to 1000 yuan, but the Central Bank sold exchange bills. The Central Bank sold shillings at 75. The exchange market was tight. Hengyu Fuxing Yong and other positions advanced, and suddenly the price was pushed up to 12 yuan. Fuchang Dalian Tianfeng Hengyu Fuyu and others unloaded their positions one after another. In an instant, it retreated back to 991 yuan. Rumors started again. Yicheng Tongyi Shunmao Shang advanced, and then rebounded to 100 yuan, while Hongxing Hongli seemed to have unloaded their positions, and fell back to 996 yuan. The situation was extremely chaotic. The noon closing was 9975.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 994 yuan. The Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices showed a further decline of two and a half yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yongheng Yu advanced to 1004 yuan, Wanxing Fuxing Yong unloaded their positions, falling to 999 yuan. Hengyu Dadecheng Shunli advanced again, and rose to 1004 yuan and a half. Richang Tianfeng Yong Wanxing sold their positions. Hua Bi sold January US dollars at 375, falling to 999 yuan. Hengyu Dafa Yong Ding Kang Yuanmao Yong advanced again. The Chinese merchants pulled again, the domestic market was tight again, and the price rose to 12 yuan. Yuanchun Hengtai Yuqing Yongjiatai Hengchang Yong unloaded their positions one after another, gradually declining. Mumbai rose 245 Anna, gradually retreating to 03. Qianchangxiang Shunli Yuqing Yong and others bought at low prices, rising to 7 yuan and a half, but because Yuanmao Yong Fuxing Yong sold, the price fell to 3 yuan and a half. Yicheng Dafa Yong Qingyu Yuanmao Yong Yonghe Zhengchang Dadecheng and others bought one after another, rising to 11 yuan, and Datong came out with December US dollars at 1875, and Yuanfeng Yongfu Yi had sold to 08 yuan. Mumbai suddenly dropped by 456 Anna. Qingyu Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Hengxingyuan and others scrambled to buy, rising to 13 yuan and a half. Qingyu Wanxing Fuchang sold, and retreated back into 10 yuan. Fuxing Fuyu Zhentai sold their positions, further falling to 05 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Tianfeng and others still advanced at low prices, but Shengda sold their positions, and hovered around 10. Finally, scattered short positions were urgently covered, and there was a general trend of painfully liquidating in the market, stirring up a surge, and rising to 17 yuan and a half again. The closing was 1017 yuan. After the closing, Qianchangxiang De Kang advanced their positions. A certain retail investor painfully bought in, and in an instant, the price was pushed up to above 25 yuan. Guangdong bankers Shengda fiercely sold, retreating into 20 yuan. Heng Xing sold even more, once retreating to 10 yuan, but the buyers in the market were still brave, and finally the price was extremely volatile between 14 and 15 yuan. The highest price of the day was 1020 yuan, and the lowest price was 977 yuan and a half, a fluctuation of 42 yuan and a half. As a result, it soared 52 yuan and 70 cents from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's listed standard gold price, which rose to 989. According to the closing price, the gold futures rose 28 yuan, about 6 yuan more than the previous close. The standard November sales were based on the Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's US dollar listed prices, which were sharply reduced to 31 yuan 875, equivalent to a gold price of over 1085 yuan. The account registration price for this month was 999 yuan, the same price for November, and 997 yuan for December. The water supplement in the morning was 999 yuan, and the price of pure gold was 987 yuan and a half. The account registration for the afternoon was 1019 yuan for this month, the same price for November, and 1017 yuan for December. The water supplement in the afternoon was 1019 yuan. The spot market was calm, but because the gold futures rose, the water supplement was naturally reduced. Therefore, the Tianjin bankers sold more than a thousand taels to Yingfeng Heng, but only added 9 yuan and a half. The turnover of swap transactions was very quiet. Tian Changxiang paid Xiangfeng one and a half yuan. Afterwards, the gold futures soared, and the premium was cheap. Ding Tai and Ding Chang had reduced the swap with Yingfeng Heng to a flat swap. The public orders were still lacking redemption today.</p>
<p>The market transactions were chaotic, and many scattered short positions were painfully liquidated. In summary, Wanxing, Shunli, Shengda, Yuqing, Yonghengxing, Futai, Xiangfu, Changyuanxing, and others were on the selling side. Senchang Yong Shen Kang Dafa Yong Da Changxiang Changsheng Yong Fuyu Heng Xingyuan Renfa Yong Xianghe and others were on the buying side.

<h3 id="e238">Foreign Exchange Short Squeeze Intensifies <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Resulting in a Decrease of One Penny in British Currency and a Strong Decrease of Two Yuan in US Currency</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegraphs, the London large, medium, and small positions suddenly fell by one penny, but the spot market was unfavorable. The US silver fell by 1.25 points, and London spot gold fell by 2.5 pennies. British currency rose 25 against US currency, and US currency fell 375 against British currency. British currency moved suddenly against French currency, and US currency fell 25 against French currency. The news that the US side agreed to exchange silver for gold had been reported in the newspapers, but it had little impact. The exchange market opening bid was 1 shilling and 4 pence 625 for the near-term selling price for British currency and 34 yuan 1875 for the US currency, a tightening of 0625 for British currency and 1875 for US currency compared to the previous close. However, these were all buying prices, with no supply. The opening was unusually tight. Although the Central Bank provided some supply, the Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices for British and US currency were repeatedly sharply reduced, and the Chinese merchants pulled even more fiercely. The domestic market then trended tighter all the way. British gold tightened to within 1 shilling and 4 pence, and US currency retreated to within 32 yuan. At this time, the theory of the banking community balancing the market price became popular again, and it loosened slightly. The Central Bank continued to sell a lot of US dollars, but the Central Bank's counter-selling of shillings caused Chinese merchants to feel bullish again, and the market turned tight from hard at noon. Although the banks sold in the afternoon, there were no luxury merchants, and the buying appetite was still strong. The process tightened again. Mumbai initially rose and then fell, also with little impact. The closing price was 1 shilling and 3 pence 5625 for the forced-term selling price for British currency and 32 yuan 0625 for US currency, a tightening of 1 penny 125 for British currency and 2 yuan 3125 for US currency compared to the previous close. The Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices totaled a decrease of 1 penny for British currency and a decrease of 2 yuan 125 for US currency. The Chinese merchants pulled more than 2 million US dollars and more than 200,000 pounds sterling. The banks were still selling. The day's transactions are recorded below.</p>

The opening price in the morning market immediately fell by 3.5 yuan, trading at 828 yuan.

<h3 id="e241">Major Riot in the Cotton Yarn Market <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Morning Opening Shows Erratic Movements with Bulls and Bears Interfering, Leading to Temporary Increase of Eight Yuan in Margin</p>
<p>Rumors Abound in the Later Market, With a Gradual Upturn, Resulting in an Increase of Four Yuan</p>
<p>丨Many Storms Ahead丨</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Closing Extended to Late Evening</p>
<p>A major upheaval occurred in the cotton yarn market, the severity of which is unprecedented. It is rumored that our country will implement monetary policies to reduce the national currency's composition. The truth of this matter remains unknown, but the market's sentiment has been greatly shaken. Sellers are panicking to the extreme. Standard yarn opened at 9:30 AM, with the current month opening at 81 yuan, up 4.5 yuan. When it came to the November contract, the market was filled with buyers, their shouts creating chaos. Bulls and bears clashed, causing interference. Despite the intervention of the directors, a deal could not be struck. The market announced that effective today, a special cash margin would be collected from both buyers and sellers of cotton yarn and raw cotton: 8 yuan per bale of yarn and 2 yuan per *dan* of cotton. After much debate, trading finally resumed at 11:30 AM. The November contract soared by 8.5 yuan, and distant months also rose by 6-7 yuan. The second round saw a decline of 2 yuan, and the third round saw another rise. The maneuvering of bulls and bears was exceptionally active. The front market saw 97,400 bales traded. The afternoon opening shifted downward, and there was also floating speculation in the market. Because various currency policies were not immediately issued, those who had profited took the opportunity to cash out, causing the market to decline by 3-4 yuan. Observing the overall trend was extremely confusing. The total trading volume for standard yarn was 142,050 bales. Upon investigation, Zhen Da sold 1,350 bales, Tong Ji 1,150 bales, Da Fu 1,450 bales, Tong Fu 1,600 bales, Sui Long 2,250 bales, Ji 3,900 bales, Yuan Da 3,050 bales, Geng 2,350 bales, Yuan Da 1,000 bales, Yuan De 1,200 bales, Heng De 2,650 bales, Tong Xing 2,650 bales, Yi Chang 2,700 bales, Heng Chang 4,750 bales, Tong He 1,100 bales, Hui Kang 2,200 bales, and Shen Chang 1,050 bales.

<p>The Price Once Reached Eight Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market surged due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and the price of gold exceeding 1,000 yuan. At the same time, the cotton yarn price rose wildly, causing the closely related cotton market to rush along. The buying interest in the market has never been seen before. However, most cotton merchants are still selling, and the wild fluctuations in the market price are frightening. The trading volume of standard cotton reached 521,900 *dan*, a new record since the exchange was established. From this point alone, the future of the cotton market is lacking in certainty.</p>
<p>The total trading volume for standard cotton was 521,900 *dan*.

<p>According to the New Fung Yang Hong report, yesterday (the 17th) New York stock market was dull and uneven. Traders are waiting to see President Roosevelt's speech to bankers next Wednesday and clarification on the monetary and silver situation. Silver stocks fell with silver prices, especially in London, where silver was dumped. Speculators fear that the United States may stop buying silver and agree to cooperate with China. As a result, the United States will exchange gold for silver in China and restrict the purchase of silver in China. The bond market was mixed and higher, led by US government bonds. The same goes for small exchange stocks. Wheat was slack due to the rain in the Southwest. The total daily turnover was 660,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>16th 17th Rise/Fall</p>
<p>30 Stocks 94.25 94.39 Up 0.04</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market was initially stable and slightly higher, then surged wildly, and finally retreated slightly. The market price fluctuated greatly, which is rare in recent months. After the silver tax increased, the currency value generally decreased, and commodity prices naturally increased proportionally. In addition to speculation, the higher the price, the further it rose. Comparing the tax rate of 8%, commodity prices were higher than 8%. This is the first step in rising commodity prices. Once the paper currency policy is implemented, the high commodity prices are even more unimaginable. Therefore, yesterday's gold price rose wildly by dozens of yuan, and yarn and flour rose even more wildly above the prescribed price. At present, there is still hesitation and wait-and-see, so the price market also has a trend of rising sharply and falling slightly. The shorts are still skeptical. Yesterday, the first morning round still hovered steadily. However, there were some purchases, and the market price was slightly higher by one or two *jiao*. In the second round, most people understood, and most exchanges had price limits, so the shorts began to panic slightly. Inbound households were extremely active, with a wild increase of one yuan or several *jiao*. The far-term Zhengliu contract rose by more than two yuan at its highest price. As a result, trading was also very active. In the afternoon, due to time constraints, it was changed to one round. Some of the long positions and floating longs that had risen sold off, and the middle numbers fell by a small number of *jiao*. The front and rear rows were still rising. The environment and situation should continue to rise. However, there were some people in the market who wanted to suppress small market prices. However, the future is at least hovering and rising. The market price finally rose by several *jiao* to two yuan. The total turnover is estimated to be about 30 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left.

<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (the 17th) the New York stock market was dull and mixed. Traders are waiting for President Roosevelt's speech to bankers next Wednesday and clarification on the monetary and silver situation. Silver stocks fell with silver prices, especially in London, where silver was dumped. Speculators fear that the United States may stop buying silver and agree to cooperate with China.

<p>Since the opening of the flour market last year, unexpected dramatic changes have occurred. This is due to the strong rumors in the Japanese market. The origin of this rumor is the silver tax. The powerful rumors include the management of paper currency and the centralization of cash. Moreover, the recent surge in gold prices has further changed the flour market. Therefore, as soon as the market opened in the morning, it was competed for by shorts and new longs. Speculators fueled the situation, and the near-month flour price soared by 1.8 *jiao*, and the consecutive contracts rose by 8-9 *fen*. In the afternoon, various factories sold heavily, and the market suddenly fell. The rise and fall during the day were more than 1.5 *jiao*. The final closing price in October was only up 2 *fen*, November and December were up 2.5 *fen*, January was up 2.75 *fen*, and February was up 3.5 *fen*.</p>
<p>Although the price of foreign wheat was only slightly higher by 3-4 *jiao* when the wheat market opened in the morning, the sentiment in the market was agitated. This is because the rumors in the market have been strong in recent days, the gold price has soared, and buying interest has been extremely strong. Both short covering and new buying were strong, and the market rose repeatedly. The prices of various near-term months jumped by 2-3 *jiao*. In the afternoon, with the decline in flour, the market sentiment gradually stabilized, and the prices of various months fell by a small number of *fen*, ranging from 1 *jiao*. The final closing price in October was up 1.9 *jiao*, November was up 1.7 *jiao*, December was up 1.8 *jiao*, January was up 2.3 *jiao*, and February was up 2.2 *jiao*. There were 1,000 bales of new spot wheat for sale, which was high-quality wheat after the fire. The price reached 3.67 yuan, which was also higher than the previous day by a certain amount.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Soybean Oil, Soybean Cakes, and Miscellaneous Grains Rise Together <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the silver tax issue, all industries in the city have been affected. Soybean oil, soybean cakes, and miscellaneous grains have risen sharply due to the increase in flour, wheat, and foreign rice. However, no one has paid attention to new soybeans due to quality concerns, and the market price has also increased slightly. The foreign villages in Zhima, Fu Lu, are active. People who trade foreign goods and those who trade with intention are collecting them. The market traded about 3,000 bales of various kinds of sesame yesterday. The line clearance saw an increase of 7-8 *fen* to 1 *jiao*. Because the sales of soybean cakes have recovered, there are inquiries from Shantou and other places. The total market opening for various factory brands was 17,000-18,000 pieces of soybean cake, and the market price rose by nearly 1.2 yuan. The factory's soybean appetite is expanding. About 20 carts of Yingzhou beans were processed yesterday, and the price has accumulated an increase of 6-7 *fen*, reaching 3.1 *jiao*. Broad beans have also risen in price. The oil yield of soybean oil is 2-3 *jiao* higher than before.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Not Forgetting National Humiliation at Banquets <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The 14th's newspaper reported that the Shandong Province decided that government officials' banquets would have 18 first-class dishes, named "September 18th," 11 medium-class dishes, named "January 28th," and 8 side dishes, named "May 3rd," reportedly "to show that we do not forget national humiliation."</p>
<p>We recall that in the past year or two, the Northeast was lost, and the borders of North China and other regions were in danger. The people of the whole country were angry that the country would be destroyed without a day, as if mourning their parents. This is because the unworthy descendants of the Yellow Emperor have deeply received the "substantial benefits" of "common language, common race, and co-prosperity," and their pain is so deep and their sorrow is so great. However, many friends who are accustomed to enjoyment feel that this kind of "mourning and vegetarian" atmosphere is too serious, so they shout the slogan of saving the country without forgetting entertainment, saving the country without forgetting... When people's spirits are numb, they are easily changed from entertainment to saving the country, jumping to slogans such as not saving the country, and therefore, after a series of bombings by airplanes and artillery, there are again strings and dances, a sound of joy.</p>
<p>These phenomena illustrate the process of national disasters and humiliations being forgotten by a part of the people. Now, at the time when the gentlemen of the banquet are eating eighteen dishes and eight large bowls, they are strongly reminded by the names of "September 18th," "January 28th," and "May 3rd" to be alert, which is truly admirable. However, it is unknown what the guests who are visiting the high halls taste after trying the "September 18th," "January 28th," and "May 3rd" in the chef's kitchen. I wonder if the "lingering fragrance in the corners of the mouth" is the taste of delicacies from mountains and seas, or the bloody smell of the flesh and blood of compatriots who died for the country in these national humiliations and disasters? It is also unknown whether, when toasting and drinking, they should "not forget" the "national humiliation" because of the name of a banquet, express sorrow for the motherland, or not return until they are drunk? On the one hand, the guests and hosts must be happy, and on the other hand, they must "not forget the national humiliation," which makes the hosts "cry and laugh," and they must be embarrassed!</p>
<p>When the Pyeongsin Railway was opened to traffic, the wooden sandal friends on the dining car treated us with "mutual benefit soup." After receiving it, it was not seen as any "mutual benefit," so how can we expect people who eat "September 18th," "January 28th," and "May 3rd" to "not forget national humiliation" in the midst of drinking and revelry!</p>
<h3 id="e249">Red Smartweed Flowers Wither <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>The Yingtou Lake, shrouded in the morning mist, is fascinating. Every day, the bell of the chapel calls back my wandering dreams. I put on my morning gown and welcome the shallow smile of Yingtou Lake. I stroll slowly, using a poet-like attitude, visiting every flower and grass of Yingtou Lake. I have received enough of every frown and smile of Yingtou Lake. Therefore, I am fascinated by the Yingtou Lake, shrouded in the morning green, deeply, deeply.</p>
<p>The early autumn Yingtou Lake is even more fascinating. On the shallow beach near the water, there are clusters of red smartweed flowers. The red smartweed flowers, shrouded in the morning mist, are fascinating, just like the Yingtou Lake, shrouded in the morning mist. The autumn melancholy, dyed on this early autumn Yingtou Lake, is a picture of Jiang Yan. This is a good source of sadness for a young man who has been traumatized. However, this beautiful environment does not allow me, nor does it encourage me, to cry bitterly, but only a faint melancholy, a faint melancholy. I am happy with this faint melancholy and stop the journey of rushing.</p>
<p>The red smartweed flowers on the shallow beach have faded!</p>
<p>As usual, I put on my morning gown and strolled slowly. I am going to bid farewell to the withered red smartweed flowers. However, when I gradually strolled closer to the beach, the rest was the same, without any change. Yingtou Lake was still smiling shallowly, shrouded in the morning mist. The soft branches of the autumn willow were still a touch of faint melancholy. However, beside the red smartweed flowers, there was a girl in purple clothes. The morning breeze fluttered her purple sleeves. Although I only saw her back, this back was like a beautiful woman with a secluded resentment "leaning on the bamboo at sunset," or this was the flower goddess and moon goblin in mythology.</p>
<p>Staring intently at this back as it slowly disappeared, I returned home disappointed. Every day, when I put on my morning gown and strolled slowly, this girl in purple clothes was always standing by the red smartweed flowers. Moreover, I only ever saw her back, and I watched her back slowly disappear every day.</p>
<p>However, on the quiet morning of the second Sabbath, I could no longer see this girl in purple clothes. Moreover, I could never see her again, all the way to today, which is a full five long years!</p>
<p>But when the red smartweed flowers wither, perhaps Yingtou Lake is still smiling shallowly, shrouded in the morning mist, but what about this girl in purple clothes! Is she still unharmed? When I face this cluster of withered red smartweed flowers, I want to bless this girl in purple clothes.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Autumn <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Niao</p>
<p>Crows are cawing overhead.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" He took two steps back. Spitting a mouthful of phlegm, he walked forward again.</p>
<p>The autumn sun shone on the road, and many, many legs, trouser legs in suits, trouser legs in long pants... trampled past. He felt dizzy, as if he was the only unemployed person in this big city, dragging himself behind the crowd.</p>
<p>Walking past many of the same roads, the silk shops were flying flags with big discounts. People were going in and out shoulder to shoulder, and big and small packages flashed in front of him. He noticed the broken single shirt on his body, and beads of sweat seeped out from his neck. He lowered his head and looked at his own toes and walked forward.</p>
<p>It was an hour after he left home that he arrived at Yueyou's house.</p>
<p>His friend was not at home, and his friend's wife invited him to the bedroom. His eyes fell to the corner, where a new cradle was placed, and a newborn baby was sleeping. But this bedroom seemed too spacious. He couldn't remember what piece of furniture was missing from the cradle.</p>
<p>"Sit down for a while, Mr. X, he will be back soon."</p>
<p>He stepped back and sat on the bed.</p>
<p>"How long has this child been born?"</p>
<p>"Less than a month."</p>
<p>The child cried, and the mother picked him up from the cradle and teased him. "Call him uncle," and then rocked him downstairs.</p>
<p>He stood up and looked around the bedroom, as if everything was unfamiliar. He took a few steps back and forth, and his toes kept bumping into scattered objects. He remembered to reach into his pocket, but it was empty. He didn't bring a cigarette case. He stepped back and sat on the bed, and caught a glimpse of a box of cigarettes on the pillow. He picked it up, but it was empty, so he threw it away.</p>
<p>He accidentally saw that the clock on the table was already twelve o'clock. He remembered that his wife was waiting for him with an empty pot, so he got up and walked out. His friend's wife appeared at the top of the stairs. The two of them were standing in front of the door.</p>
<p>"Mr. X, sit down for a while, he will be back soon."</p>
<p>"Where did he go?"</p>
<p>"That... I'm afraid he went to see a friend."</p>
<p>The staircase was like lacquer, and he couldn't see anything. It seemed that his friend's wife had stepped back downstairs, and he stepped down step by step.</p>
<p>"Tell him I came to see him when he gets back."</p>
<p>"He'll be back soon, Mr. X. Will you have a meal before you go?"</p>
<p>After seeing him out the back door, he walked away without looking back.</p>
<p>The autumn sun shone on the road, and many, many legs, trouser legs in suits, trouser legs in long pants... trampled past. He felt dizzy, as if he was the only unemployed person in this big city, dragging himself behind the crowd.</p>
<p>When he got home, his wife was waiting at the door. She stepped aside to let him in, and then followed him in.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>"Nothing...?"</p>
<p>"Went to see a friend!"</p>
<p>They sat in silence. The clock was already ten past one. His wife ran downstairs suddenly, and came back up to give him a letter.</p>
<p>"Just came in the mail."</p>
<p>A bitter smile spread across his face, and he carefully opened the envelope. After reading it, he tore it into pieces and threw it away.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>Without answering, he took out a cigarette from the drawer and smoked it.</p>
<p>His wife bent down to pick up the larger pieces of paper. On them was written...</p>
<p>"...This Saturday... initiate... an excursion to Zhenru, please you... time to gather at the North Station..."</p>
<p>She looked up. Her husband had fallen on the bed.</p>
<h3 id="e251">A Certain Night <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>A heavy rain was falling, and a group of people turned into the dance hall. Inside, the jazz music clashed discordantly with the roaring sound of the rain outside the window. Only a thin layer of glass separated the two worlds—heaven and hell.</p>
<p>The fragrance of hair, the lips of mouths, the scent of rouge, semi-nude white organic statues, semi-nude golden organic statues, a moving spring bathing picture.</p>
<p>Indiscriminately chilling, revolving, a limitless exchange of peach-colored passions...</p>
<p>Dance, dance, everyone is pushing someone into the sea. One by one, the gentlemen threw themselves in, like cicada-fish, cicada-fish-like women!</p>
<p>With each piece of music, a branch slipped into each man's embrace, one slipping into that one's side, and another slipping into this one's side.</p>
<p>Dance, dance, we need excitement, they all said so hysterically, saying it while embracing the women's waists and drifting away, floating.</p>
<p>Everyone danced, but the small young writer was left alone guarding the table.</p>
<p>Half-closed eyes, smoking a cigarette, exhaling white misty smoke, fantasizing...</p>
<p>—Taking the harvest of exhausted essence to gamble on fleeting luxury, exchanging it for some temporary false joy. Thinking of the old suffering of not being able to write a single word for a long time, his enthusiasm immediately died down.</p>
<p>Therefore, he quit dancing. However, these places are precisely the barren places for solitary individuals, and in lonely times, his legs instinctively slide towards the edge. Sitting idly is also quite flavorful, calling for a cup of tea, leisurely smoking, watching the line of fruits before him!</p>
<p>For a moment, he would forget his existence and also lose the shadow of loneliness.</p>
<p>The critic returned and encouraged him, and the celebrity returned and also motivated him. Whoever returned said the same thing.</p>
<p>What they said made his heart waver a little.</p>
<p>So he thought. Watching others dance all the time really isn't flavorful enough, damn it, let's have a good time! He also went into the sea. Everyone laughed and said, but he gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>He immediately suffered from an opium den syndrome. Once he entered the sea, he sank to the depths of the water. One after another, he embraced one woman after another. Stepping to the beat, stepping to the slow melody of waltzes. Dancing and dancing as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Before sitting down, he chased after the crashing cymbals and started dancing again. Several people applauded behind him. But while dancing, he gritted his teeth like that, not saying a single word to the women. He was hugging a piece of wood, turning around and around without looking around.</p>
<p>In pain, searching for happiness, ah.</p>
<p>After two o'clock. He felt a little tired. He felt like a deflated ball, without even the strength to breathe. So he walked out the door.</p>
<p>On the night streets, the rain had cleared, and the wind in the late autumn night was strong enough. With a blow, all the warmth on his body disappeared, replaced by a feeling of utter desolation.</p>
<p>Walking out of a volcano, he fell into the ice cave of the human heart.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Autumn at the Six Banyan Temple <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Tuoren</p>
<p>Autumn has already arrived in the human world.</p>
<p>Rui, a frail young man, walked step by step towards the Six Banyan Temple against the autumn wind. When he reached the small gate of the temple, he stopped, as if pondering something, standing there in a daze for about ten minutes before taking a big step and walking up the stone steps.</p>
<p>The Six Banyan Temple, this ancient temple of many years, is shrouded in a desolate mood in autumn. The banyan trees have already been dyed a deep yellow, and the fallen leaves are like chicks in the molting season, scattered by the autumn wind. A kind of serene, quiet, and sorrowful scenery is movingly revealed in this ancient temple.</p>
<p>Looking at the tranquil scene before him, his lonely heart was even more melancholy. He sat blankly on the stone bench under the shade of the trees, as if he had lost his soul, and his thin, dark hands stroked his disheveled hair in silence.</p>
<p>Autumn is a pleasant, beautiful, gentle, and lovely season!</p>
<p>The autumn days are so short! The sun has already slipped behind the trees in an instant, and heavy shadows have covered the stone steps of the main hall of the temple. Tourists have gradually become scarce in the quiet temple, and only Rui sits alone in loneliness in this ancient temple.</p>
<p>The golden light of the sun shot out egg-shaped shadows from behind the trees, as if printed on the walls on both sides of the hall gate like colored paper. Rui, with his eyes wide open, stared at it with great absorption, and the events of two years ago floated up in his mind like phantoms.</p>
<p>It was when he and Ming were about to leave that Ming pulled him together to this famous ancient temple. Because both of them felt the loneliness and unease of leaving, they always silently looked at each other on the stone bench. Ming saw the leaf shadows on the wall, tightly held Rui's hand, and spoke.</p>
<p>"Rui, look, how beautiful the leaf shadows are printed on the wall. I'll make an agreement with you first. Let's meet here again at this time two years later! As long as it's an autumn afternoon with leaf shadows on the wall, is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, two years later? Okay! After you leave this time, I also hope that we can meet here again one day as you said. However, I think things can't be decided like that, right? I might leave here as well."</p>
<p>"In any case, let's make this agreement! That day will always come."</p>
<p>Rui, when he thought of the sentence "That day will always come," his heart felt so sad that he dared not think any further, because today was the agreed-upon day! But Ming never arrived, only he sat alone on the stone bench. He thought in his heart, "Ming made an agreement with me, why did he go to another world?"</p>
<p>The sun had already slipped over the western hemisphere, and the autumn wind at dusk, blowing on his body, was already a bit cold. Rui, however, was still sitting in this quiet temple, like a fallen leaf that had suffered the ravages of the autumn wind, staring blankly at the wall next to the main hall, recalling the circumstances of his friend Ming's death for the revolution. He remained there until everything around him was blurred and the night god had arrived, before he stood up and walked out of the gate of the Six Banyan Temple with heavy steps. But the image of autumn at the Six Banyan Temple was even more deeply imprinted in Rui's mind.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Stupidity and Evil <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Shimazaki Toson, translated by Wakagi</p>
<p>Pratin, in Ibsen's memoirs, once said this: "As Flommer said, humans become evil things because they are stupid. But Ibsen said that humans become unbelievably stupid because they are evil."</p>
<p>If the words of the two are compared, it is very strange and interesting, because if we observe the world according to Flommer's view that humans are foolish, then there will be no kind people in the world. However, if we observe from Ibsen's standpoint, then there will be no fools among humans. At the same time, if we move Ibsen's words to the position of moral theory, then there will be nothing in the world more virtuous than humans.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Recommendation of the Special Issue on Modern American Literature <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Since the emergence of new literature in China, it has completely followed the path of Western literature. However, needless to say, young people who love literature, even literary writers, how many of them have specialized research on Western literature? To take a step back, even among those who have considerable research on Western literature, those who have deep and specialized research on the literature of each nation are truly as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. This is a fact that no one can deny. We young people who love literature, to speak frankly and impolitely, we not only hope that the writers who are working hard in the literary movement on the literary scene will create meaningful and valuable works, but also hope that they will introduce us to some basic and even general knowledge of literature. However, the majority of our famous writers are planning for their own livelihood and the goal of being in the limelight, and they completely disregard our expectations. The "editorial writers" of literary magazines (because they are writers and also editors) are only publishing crudely made works with savage origins in order to attract attention widely. They do not want to find ways to educate us on basic and even general knowledge of literature. And the various books on basic and even general knowledge of literature published by a group of commercialized book editors are so shallow and ridiculous that they cannot be added to. Even our intellectuals are disappointed, let alone the masses who are the target of the efforts of a group of teachers who advocate mass literature education universities. Recently, "Modern" magazine published a "Special Issue on Modern American Literature," which initially gave us a happy and excited feeling on the advertisements. When we bought a copy to read, it was even more satisfying and aroused interest in studying the literature of a nation. The first thing that the "Special Issue on Modern American Literature" gives us is to tell us that those who want to study Western literature and obtain the knowledge necessary for literary cultivation should study the literature of individual nations specifically. This kind of research can not only hope to obtain rich specialized literary knowledge, but also can arouse a strong interest in studying Western literature. The second thing that it gives us is to introduce us to the systematic and literary knowledge of various departments of American literature, so that we can understand what kind of literature American literature is, where its characteristics lie, and what its value is. This kind of understanding, of course, can only give us a concept limited by the editorial space of a magazine, but this concept is already enough for the initial cultivation of young people who love literature.</p>
<p>These are my thoughts after reading the "Special Issue on Modern American Literature." At the same time, several friends who love literature as much as I do also have the same thoughts as mentioned above. Therefore, I believe that the "Special Issue on Modern American Literature" should be recommended to all young comrades who love literature.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Outside the Greenhouse <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Chulou</p>
<p>Downtown,</p>
<p>The street is blowing with the early autumn wind. Female office workers, like nimble butterflies, one after another, wearing the fashionable autumn clothes, holding a big book, walk towards their offices.</p>
<p>Capitalists transport all kinds of novel commodities from the golden country, from the Mediterranean, from England, investing huge capital to create a prosperous Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, SEAL has become an indispensable suffix on the advertising windows of shops. Anyway, there are four seasons in a year, and there are cheap prices every season. In addition, there are anniversaries, second anniversaries... The cheap prices cannot be finished.</p>
<p>People are surging like the spring tide, surging. I cannot bear the low air pressure in the crowd, and helplessly look at the sky, but the sky is also crisscrossed with the wind of electric currents.</p>
<p>After turning two or three corners in a row, as if avoiding a fierce wolf, I walked into a secluded and cold street, my mind was a little clearer, I slowed down my pace, looking east and west, but looking for a poem? I ask myself:</p>
<p>Oh! I saw that a new flower shop had opened here.</p>
<p>There is steam on the glass, obviously, this is warm.</p>
<p>Is the warm greenhouse a warm bed for buds? Wandering people, don’t you think of your home? I envy every leaf and bud in the greenhouse, even though it is only tiny and tiny!</p>
<p>The color of the tulip is noble, and she proudly, with plump branches and leaves, supports her smiling face, it should be so charming! Normal temperature air is protecting her.</p>
<p>It seems like I have changed places, otherwise, where would this chaos come from? Oh! I didn't tell you, I saw another tulip, two tulips, three tulips... countless tulips, they are trembling, no, she is dancing, in the charming rhythm.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t this be some dream, I hear their silver zither-like sound? Looking carefully again, indeed, they, not only them, but there are also some men who laugh with joy: "Flower! Everything beautiful in the world is ashamed and bows down under your dazzling light." This voice seems to accompany the music. So the tulip, with her noble yellow, danced and jumped onto the giant's sleeve, pouring her fragrance into that mountain cave full of thorns, no, it's a nostril. The giant doesn't seem to wake up, but at this moment, he has moved, smiling on his mouth, holding the tulip in his palm.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, the tulip will grow old, and the giant actually threw an old one out the window. There was a sharp cry outside the window. But the giant still picked up new tulip buds and smiled, he said, "With you, everything beautiful in the world is dimmed."...</p>
<p>How can I not be afraid? But somehow, my forehead hit an ice block.</p>
<p>My mind cleared, I was still outside the greenhouse, my head must have touched the glass, and it made a little noise. Fortunately, there was no one in the greenhouse, I had to stagger away.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am 26 years old this year, a junior high school graduate. I have been working in a yarn factory for twelve years. I am not yet engaged or married. Now, because I am dissatisfied with my family, I plan to leave the family and establish a father-son relationship with someone. However, this matter has not been approved by my parents, and it is my personal initiative. I don't know if it can be done. Now I have several doubts. Please answer them as soon as possible. I would be grateful.</p>
<p>(1) My original residence is in Jiangxi. Is it an obstacle to the law if I want to adopt a person of Zhejiang origin?</p>
<p>(2) Is this matter legally effective because it is my personal initiative and has not been approved by my parents and clan? Do parents and clan have the right to pursue this matter afterwards?</p>
<p>(3) Is there a risk that the clan will have a bad impression of me and cancel my original residence in the</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>genealogy?</p>
<p>Respectfully yours, Wang Shi</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Unless there is an overwhelming reason and the absolute impossibility of living together, there seems to be no need to break away from the family, because having lived together for more than 20 years, you should be able to understand each other better than others. If you take the action of breaking away from the family because of an accidental bad impression and other unilateral reasons, there may be a day of regret and pain in the future. I hope Mr. Wang will give this matter careful consideration. The questions you asked are answered below:</p>
<p>(1) The "adopting a son" you mentioned has absolutely nothing to do with region.</p>
<p>(2) Since Mr. Wang is an adult, he can of course act freely within the scope of the law, and no one can interfere, and there is no need to seek the consent of parents or clansmen.</p>
<p>(3) Whether a bad impression is created or not is a matter of human relations and has nothing to do with the law. Whether or not to cancel the genealogy is not a big problem either, because once the adoptive relationship is established, it is cut off from the original clan, so there is no need to cancel it.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Shanghai Scenery"</p>
<p>I received a letter from an esteemed friend. Listening to wireless electricity is an elegant entertainment. The singing and dancing halls are colorful. Western music plays in harmony around the ears. Every dancing girl is beautiful. Like Chang'e, the fairy in the moon. Face to face, shoulder to shoulder. Wearing dance clothes of bright colors. There is also that group of prostitutes in the brothel singing in unison. Gently tapping gongs and drums, playing silk strings. Dozens of cinemas are showing. Good Chinese and foreign films with sound. The restaurants are lively. The massages are wonderful but difficult to describe. On the road. Cars speed like flying. Better than that. A living immortal on Penglai Mountain. Schools everywhere are on summer vacation. Young people also have a few days to spend leisurely. Strolling and talking in the park. Lovers stroll hand in hand. It is really only envy the mandarin duck, not envy the immortal.</p>

<p>Thirteenth Sister has become an image of Lu Zhonglian, she has taken the position of matchmaker, and she is showing off her matchmaking skills. She has really united An and Zhang in marriage. So she stood on the seat of the wedding witness, accepting the ceremony of bowing to heaven and earth from both of them!</p>
<p>This is also: "Comfort in pain!"</p>
<p>Thirteenth Sister also gave one hundred taels of silver to Zhang's parents, which was considered a dowry for them.</p>
<p>Now, they are really leaving!</p>

<p>Who is the third sister in love with? Second Master Lian is very worried about this matter, but Second Sister told him: "Since Third Sister has chosen someone who is to her liking, you can just follow her!" Second Master Lian was still very uneasy and asked: "Who is this likable person? Who is it?" Second Sister said: "According to what she said herself, if this person dies and never comes again, she would rather shave her head and become a nun, eat vegetarian food and chant Buddha, and never marry again!" This is really puzzling!</p>

<p>Who is not snobbish? Enjoy! In this turbid society, there will always be those so-called snobs who help others to bully themselves!</p>
<p>Originally, they were respectful, but now because he is not doing this vanity, everyone is cold to him!</p>

<p>Guanyin Society "A Fate in Tears and Laughter" 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM</p>
<p>Because Guan Xiugu saw Shen Fengxi's pitiful condition, she really couldn't bear it in her heart, so she made a phone call to Fan Jiashu to talk to him in Central Park. The green lotus leaves of Shichahai, like withered old men, lay horizontally in the swamp lake, living out their remaining autumn? Since Fan Jiashu was insulted by Fengxi this time, Guan Xiugu mentioned Fengxi's matter to him, and he strongly advocated not mentioning it! Mentioning it would make him sad, so? Guan Xiugu had to talk about other things for a while, but Fan Jiashu's words were all indirectly insinuating Xiugu. Xiugu, who was standing in the position of a third party, was also caught up in the vortex of love in her vague consciousness!</p>

<p>Zhang Mengfei Ballad 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter Su Qin</p>
<p>The world is cold and fickle, it has been said since ancient times. Su Qin failed the imperial examination and returned home. He once traveled and studied with difficulty. He submitted his memorial ten times, but his ambition could not be fulfilled. He was helpless in the face of bad luck and difficult times. Returning home, he was ashamed to face his parents. His wife did not leave the loom and continued to weave. His sister-in-law did not cook for him, as if he were a stranger. His parents were angry and glared at him. The whole family looked down on him. Su Qin was annoyed and ashamed, and had no face to live. He wanted to throw himself into an old well and end his life. Fortunately, his uncle Su Gong was old. He persuaded him with good words and saved him from death. From then on, he studied hard under the window with great determination. He pierced his thigh with an awl and tied his hair to the beam to study deeply. Finally, he persuaded the princes with his eloquent tongue. He united the six kingdoms against the strong Qin. One day, he returned to his hometown. His ambition was high and he was respected. In the end, one must become famous.</p>
