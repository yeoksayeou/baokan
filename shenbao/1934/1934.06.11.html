<h3>我國絲業之危機與其出路</h3>

<p>我國絲業衰落。已成爲舉世共知之事實。單以滬杭路所運輸之　包而論。以前常年爲十五六萬包。去年已减至五萬餘包。今年且不及四萬包。雖鐵道運費過高。繭商改由水運。亦爲减少原因之一。然其根本癥結。實在於整個世界之不景氣。蓋形成經濟恐慌之眞因。爲一般消費與生產間失去平衡。商品堆積愈多。而消費者之購買力反愈縮。遂致反映巿面之恐慌也。絲之爲物。在久居於都巿者視之。司空見慣。不足爲奇。但其格過於昂貴。中流社會以下皆目之爲奢侈品。於是在不景氣期間。生絲及絲製品所受之打擊。尤爲嚴重。至於我國絲業之衰頽。除受世界不景氣影響外。猶有特殊原因。分析如次。　　第。一人造絲業逐漸發逹。其品質雖不盡佳。而巿面價格。僅及蠶絲三分之一。以至二分之一。是以一般人士。皆樂於購用。在歐美不產蠶絲諸國。固多以人造絲代用。卽我國號稱世界絲業之發祥地。亦竟爲人造絲之重要顧客。而使蠶絲益相形而見絀。第二在二十年前。世界生絲及絲製品巿中。我國號稱獨步。嗣因日本之改進。印度之崛起。我國絲業在海外巿塲之地位。乃日漸低落。加以當業者。未能充分理解海外巿塲之情況。生絲品質。往往不適宜於機械織造之用。一切推銷事宜。亦率由舊章。未遑改良。故日絲勃興以後。不惟我國在美巿塲爲其所侵奪。卽印度洋以西之銷路。亦日見衰微。第三。我國經營絲業者。大抵重視眼前利益。而忽略將來。同業中人對於共同團結向外發展之道。幾未注意。是以不能與他人作積極之競爭。有些三種特殊原因。華絲之衰敗。自更不足怪。</p>
<p>我國因絲業之不振。遂使農村經濟。大受打擊。已爲周知之事實。蓋我國農村經濟。向恃農作物收穫以外之副業。以爲調劑。農民若純粹恃農作物經營之一端。而别無收入。則費力多而獲利薄。晚近機械製品輸入以後。農民消費亦相當增加。尤非有副業之補助不可。在黄河流域諸省區之農村。農民副業不甚發逹。故不如江浙農村之充裕。農村副業向以蠶桑業爲最有利。江浙以外如四川。廣東。山東各省農家。亦多倚賴春繭之收穫。以資週轉。甚至衣着之需。亦全仰給於此。現在生繭價格。旣已低落。農家殖桑所得。甚至不能償付肥料及地租之支出。故鄕間停止裁培桑苗。及砍除桑樹之舉。到處有之。結果在農村旣少一種副業。在城巿。亦足影響製絲工人之生計。農工階級旣同受其累。經營生絲及絲織品買賣之商人。自亦不能獨全。</p>
<p>我國絲業前途之一綫生機。首在改良絲質。絲業中人。固應和衷共濟。向外發展。政府當局。亦須積極提倡。予以獎勵。聞行政院最近已核准救濟絲業之根本辦法。可謂差强人意之事。惟其具體成績。則猶待表現耳。最近數月來。英日荷日之經濟關係。對立愈深排斥日絲之舉。幾已普遍於全世界。是爲我國絲業界一致奮發。恢復海外巿塲。重奠絲業基礎之良好時機也。至於國内巿塲。尤當妥爲保持。卽如經久耐用。乃華絲固有之特長。我國製絲家如不能花様翻新。以博一時之美觀。至少亦不應抛棄固有優點。以致爲重實用者所不取。尙時髦者所輕視也。</p>
<p>小恊約對俄復交</p>
<h3>羅捷俄三外長正式換文　彼此互約尊重主權　防德陣綫益見鞏固　南斯拉夫態度尙待决定</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）羅馬尼亞及捷克今日正式承認蘇俄政府、蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫及小恊約國外長集議至今晨一時、散會後卽將此事宣布云、捷克外長皮尼士與俄外長李維諾夫及羅馬尼亞外長鐵杜婁斯哥與李維諾夫於正午交換文書、樹立捷克與蘇俄及羅馬尼亞與蘇俄間之正常關係、據稱南斯拉夫外長葉夫的區回歸貝爾格勒報告政府後、南斯拉夫亦將對承認蘇俄問題宣布態度、聞南斯拉夫國王亞力山在反對承認蘇俄政府、故小恊約國現已放棄一致行動、（九日國民社電）</p>
<p>羅京　羅馬尼亞爲承認蘇俄而與蘇俄交換之文件、已於今日在此間簽字、其簽字地點、爲羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥所住之白爾格旅館、蘇俄外委李維諾夫·捷克外長貝勒斯·羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥·及南斯拉夫外長葉夫的區均在塲、李維諾夫與蒂杜樓斯哥交換兩批文件、（按第一批爲兩國彼此說明願恢復國交之公文、第二批爲彼此相約尊重主權、不作宣傳活動之公文）彼此公文均作主動口吻、並非一方提議、一方答復者、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　羅馬尼亞業已承認蘇俄、事前兩國曾商定彼此尊重主權、蘇俄外委李維諾夫曾以公函證明此事、謂兩國政府相約尊重主權、彼此對於對方之内政、無論直接間接均不干涉、尤以避免一切宣傳活動爲要、彼此更相約各不組織擾亂對方國家之團體、其自行組織者不得加以援助、並不許其在境内停留、凡武裝力量及軍器軍火、用以接濟此項擾亂團體者、彼此均禁止入境、亦不聽其通過云、羅馬尼亞外長亦有同様公函、致送李維諾夫、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄入國聯又一步驟</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯方面聞小恊約國現對蘇俄政府成立外交關係之消息、大爲欣慰、俄外長李維諾夫與捷克羅馬尼亞兩國外交當局業已互換蘇俄與捷羅間尋常關係之函、衆料南斯拉夫國於其外相葉夫狄志游巴黎返國後、亦將對俄復交、小恊約國今日在此宣佈承認蘇俄、衆視此爲蘇俄加入國聯之又一步驟預料蘇俄加入國聯事、九月間當可美滿解决、同時李維諾夫現正籌擬東歐互助公約之計畫、關於此事、法國亦甚關切不僅小恊約國已也、聞德國與波蘭皆已被請參加、但此兩國皆尙未表示接受此請之願意、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅捷與俄換文内容</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）捷克與羅馬尼亞承認蘇俄之文件、今晚已由小恊商各國常設政治會議予以公布、茲將該政治會議關於此事之决議案内容、報告如下决議案内稱、一九三四年六月九日、蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫與捷克外交部長貝勒斯、在日内瓦交換内容相同之公文、恢復蘇俄與捷克間之正常外交關係、羅馬尼亞與蘇俄亦交換同様公文、恢復彼此國交、南斯拉夫政府則因該國外交部長葉夫的區須正式訪問巴黎、其對此項問題須俟葉夫的區回國報告之後、始能確切决定、此係最近小恊商常設政治會議各委員與蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫談判數日之後、始經各國政府决定者、爰於本日交換公文、實行恢復國交、茲將捷克外交部長貝勒斯致蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫之公函、宣布如下、</p>
<p>逕啓者、一九三四年一月廿二日、小恊　商三國外交部長在柴格勒勃會議時、　彼此同意以爲一俟外交政治情形相宜　時、小恊商各國卽應與蘇俄恢復外交　正常關係、本年六月初、本外長與貴外　交委員談話之後、小恊商各國常設政　治會議以爲按目下外交政治情形、小　恊商各國已可照柴格勒勃之决議、分　别與蘇俄恢復國交、捷克政府於與貴　外交委員談判之後、現已决定與蘇俄　政府恢復外交關係、並决定選派全權　公使駐紥貴國、用特函逹、本外長深信　兩國恢復國交之後、必能永久諧和、而　兩民族日後必能互相合作、以謀彼此　之繁榮、並維持世界之和平云云、</p>

<h3>和平連鎖不啻添一新環　波蘭報紙之評論</h3>
<p>華沙　半官式之「波蘭日報」評論羅馬尼亞及捷克承認蘇俄事、略謂「兩國承認蘇俄、特别爲吾人所關切、因蘇俄爲波蘭之隣國、且爲同盟國、小恊商之承認蘇俄、又爲吾人之所切禱、且曾爲之致力者也」、該報又謂、羅馬尼亞承認蘇俄、在政治上有重大關係、至於捷克與蘇俄之國交上障碍、多半由於經濟組織之不同、該報以爲「捷克與蘇俄之接近、不獨在政治上有利、卽由哲學言之、亦覺有益也」、政府黨之「波蘭快報」視小恊商各國之承認蘇俄、不啻於和平連鎖上、又加一新環、殊可欣幸云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>政治經濟　組成防德集團</h3>
<p>捷京　小恊商各國與蘇俄恢復正常外交關係、係於下午五時正式發表、此事原爲一般人所料及、故輿論不以爲異、國務會議對小恊商各國常設政治會議在日内瓦之决定、完全贊成、捷克大實業家及銀行界、對於小恊商各國與蘇俄恢復正常關係、因經營事業上理由原極盼望、各報均謂此次承認、適與蘇俄重行參加歐洲政治同時發生、在國際上實有重大關係、不僅此也、小恊商各國之承認蘇俄、正値蘇俄與法國及、小恊商各國日趨、接近之時、如此不啻多數國家組成集團、以防範希特勒主義下之德國、使不致發生危害云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅國人士　聞訊驚喜交迸</h3>
<p>羅京　昨晚此間發表小恊商諸國承認蘇俄消息、京中人心大爲驚異、雖此事醞釀已歷數月、人人俱知承認一舉、勢必成爲事實、但以形勢急轉直下、人心旣深感愜意、殷憂亦一掃而空、故驟得此項消息、不無驚喜交迸也、此間報紙論調、不勝引述、於中尤宜特提「寰球」報之評論、該報爲右派之機關報、持論不啻爲羅馬尼亞國家主義派之發言人、其評述此事稱、稱爲羅外長蒂杜樓斯哥之大成功、且認爲大戰以後、羅馬尼亞政府一切外交活動中最重要之事件、而稱頌不止焉、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報認爲　法國政策表現</h3>
<p>（柏林）小恊商之捷克與羅馬尼亞兩國、業已承認蘇俄、德國報紙謂、此爲法國政策之表現、而促其成者乃法外長巴爾都也、大部份報紙謂六月十八日至二十日在羅馬尼亞京城舉行之小恊商各國會議、巴爾都將前往參加、可見蘇俄與小恊商各國之談判復交、乃巴黎方面一手造成者、德意志總匯報謂自一九三三年倫敦經濟會議期間、李維諾夫與各國簽訂互不侵犯條約（係與波斯·阿富汗·土耳其·波蘭·羅馬尼亞·拉逹維亞·愛沙尼亞·捷克等國所定者、時在七月三四日）之後、小恊商各國在事實上業已承認蘇俄、自是時起、蘇俄與歐洲東南部各國之外交關係、已另起新章、</p>
<h3>將進一步　訂立經濟恊定</h3>
<p>此次在法律上承認之後、大約小恊商各國將繼續與蘇俄訂立經濟恊定、因蘇俄木料與小麥之傾銷、已足使歐洲東南部大受損失也、</p>
<h3>放棄比省　交換承認條件</h3>
<p>柏林交易所日報謂羅馬尼亞與蘇俄間關於比薩拉比亞省問題之爭執、所以能不提起者、實賴法國斡旋之功、該報並謂、以意度之、羅馬尼亞所以能承認蘇俄者、或者因莫斯科多少已承認放棄比薩拉比亞省、蘇俄對於此事、所以能具誠意者、亦因受遠東事變推移之影響云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄日關係險惡聲中　日本對外宣傳　歐美輿論於日不利　日方指爲挑撥離間</h3>
<p>（東京）最近外務省情報處接歐美各國批評日僞俄國境糾紛之消息、殊感歐美方面之批評不利於日、甚者卽謂日方有意挑釁、廣田外相乃於昨日向駐外大公使、電告國境方面糾紛之所謂眞相、而命各大公使就地作利日宣傳、（十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）最近傳聞日本對於蘇俄及其他各國形勢險惡諸如是類之惡劣宣傳、風行於歐美各國、又因俄日「滿」國境方面蘇聯曾有挑撥行爲、近則反覆宣傳、似乎日蘇關係急將惡化、不無宣傳之根據、外務當局鑑於該項情形、爲給予世界以正當之認識起見、實覺有闡明日本政府對外態度之必要、廣田外相於九日對於駐外使臣使之將日俄間存在之事實報道其眞相、以便防止惡意宣傳、此項訓令業經發出、最近此種惡劣宣傳尙有一極端者、如據駐剳波蘭伊藤公使之報告、略謂波蘭報紙載有莫斯哥蘇聯陸軍長官鮑洛西洛夫氏與土耳其空軍代表薛拉爾貝氏及土耳其大使館武官等人會談之内容、完全屬於揑造、茲錄其文如左、</p>
<p>日本外務省當局於本年三月初旬向駐日土耳其代理大使聲稱、倘日俄開戰爲不可避免之事實、則土耳其與蘇聯曾經訂立之柯加薩斯安全保障、須强制破棄、前經日本練習艦隊松下司令官乘其往訪安哥拉之機會、亦關於日俄開戰之情形有所討論、據謂土耳其旣與日本處於同一戰綫、則土領柯加薩斯地方之自由行動、及向土耳其海軍供給武器、或在沿岸修築要塞等等工作、日本當不惜盡量努力、此係該司令官之提議、而卽由土耳其將上項内容報告蘇聯當局、因此外交人民委員長李維諾夫氏卽被派遣至日内瓦、設法使蘇聯加入國聯、而與法國成立互相援助之條約、現已成爲俄法軍事聯盟之形式矣云云、（十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日傳外蒙不安　居民紛紛避難</h3>
<p>（東京）茲據某處接到來電、據謂外蒙古地方之赤化工作、最近頗形積極、住民均感不安、尤以限制飼養家畜至爲嚴厲、故被威脅之民衆向内蒙方面逃來、近則此項難民日有增加、各旗苦於收容、蒙藏委員會爲救濟起見、擬給與離民以安居之地、現聞支出五十萬元、而實際上仍未獲其援助、據南京政府調查各地之難民爲數已逹五千、此外往外蒙隣近地方避難者約一萬人、故蒙人對於外蒙之現在政權、均抱有極度之反感、而自今以後、該地方之赤化運動、更將愈趨熾烈、頗爲一般所注目云、（十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>東北義軍　襲擊秋木莊站　焚站屋架僞警</h3>
<p>華聯社安東通訊　六月一日上午零時二十分、由安東開往瀋陽之列車抵秋木莊站時、忽有義軍四十餘名襲擊入站後之列車、鐵道守備隊及僞警約二百名、竭力與義軍劇戰、並電請鳳凰城日警察隊及鷄冠山日軍來援、義軍以衆寡不敵、劇戰良久後、縱火焚該站貨棧及站員住屋四十餘家、並架僞警官四名、收戈退後方、</p>
<h3>薩爾瓦多颶風過境　交通隔絶損害奇重</h3>
<p>（紐約）中美洲薩爾瓦多國、旋風過境、受難人民爲數極多、惟交通阻絶、實在災情尙難估計、災區道路損壞、僅可步行、鐵道損害極重、當俟兩個月後、始可恢復原狀、「自由」港中一切船隻、現暫禁止駛入、若干村鎭現尙爲水所淹、痢疾及傷寒各種傳染症、頗有蔓延之慮、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福下月出巡檀島　凖備與日本政治領袖會見　冀掃除兩國間誤解　日人傳出白宫默認</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統擬於下月上旬在檀香山與日本高級政治家會見之傳說、今日已引起政界方面紛紛揣測其將有若何結果、總統表示將於國會閉會後出巡太平洋、途經檀香山時、可與日本政治家會晤、此項會晤、已於昨日白宫欵待日本貴族院議長近衛伯時暫行約定、衆信如日本首相及外相能參加此項會議、則定能掃除日美兩國間之誤解、而於明年舉行之海軍軍縮會議應響尤大云、此項會議將使日美兩國能有直接機會、討論引起兩國糾紛之國際問題、日本對鎖中國宣言所引起之中國門户開放問題·「滿洲國」之承認問題·及九國公約問題、海軍比率問題·斐律濱獨立後之地位間題·及日本移民問題·均在其列、羅斯福總統對此複雜而重要之問題、究允談至何種程度並無表示、事實上總統更未提及此項會議、此項會議係由參加白宫宴會之日人傳出、不過白宫方面並未加以否認耳、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>意德兩雄　威尼斯叙首　軍縮及國際爲討論主題　法外長亦被邀參加談話</h3>
<p>羅馬　聞德總理希特勒來晤首相墨索里尼時、將乘飛機、因上年屢有不幸事端、使德奥間關係爲之緊張、故德總理此行來意、欲避免經過奥境也、此次兩總揆討論之主要問題、聞爲軍縮及國聯云、意國方面稱、首相墨索里尼擬力勸希特勒取中庸之道、以防止軍備競爭、尤將注重促請德國重返國聯會云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）茲據最近報告所稱、法外長巴爾都在將離日内瓦返法之前、曾接得意大利政府之通知、謂意首相墨索里尼與德總理希特勒將於下星期在威尼斯相晤云云、意大利之所以通知巴爾都者、因巴近有赴羅馬訪問之計畫、而墨索里尼則建議法外長與德總理二人之赴意訪問、應使不相衝突云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據消息靈通者稱、法外長巴爾都雖已被邀參加希特勒與墨索里尼之會議、但巴氏在秋季前、似不致往游羅馬、法政府現認法外長與德總理直接交涉之時機、刻已成熟、故法外長之參加意德兩總揆之談話、可不成問題云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）外間所傳德總理希特勒與意首相墨索里尼之晤談　將於本月中旬在威尼斯舉行云云、此說在此處官方尙無從證實、而羅馬方面所得之情報、亦無與此事有關者云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>德重返國聯　希望依然渺茫</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）自修正後之法國提案、被軍縮會議總委員會通過以來、美國外交界極爲注意、惟大局究將如何進展、則無人表示意見、政界中一般意見、咸以爲德國如仍拒絶重返日内瓦、對於限制軍備及保障安全之一般公約亦不參加、則軍縮會議萬一失敗、其主要責任、將由德國負之云云、政界所見雖如此、但在事實上、德國重返日内瓦一層、咸視爲希望絶少、外間風說、甚至謂在日内瓦最近事實之後、德國政府似已决定、無論如何决不重回日内瓦、並已將此意通知若干政府、現因美國官塲絶對緘默、究竟美國政府確否接到此種通知、無從斷定、第以情理推之、此種消息、不似有何可靠根據云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>平等權保證　端賴法國一諾</h3>
<p>（柏林）此處半官式機關外交政治評論對於日内瓦近日之調解公式、認爲係一種極度疲倦之表現、而非眞實考慮之結果、「所謂休會至十月者、不啻卽無期休會、因各委員會並未受有草就軍縮公約之責任也」、並據該報之意見、歐洲各國惟意大利之立塲、最屬磊落光明、因意大利曾拒絶參加此項欺人之舉者也、至於外間希望德國能重返軍縮會議一節、以德國之見解面言、實質之軍備减縮、實卽最良之保障、而德國在重返國聯之前、勢必先需得有切實之保證、確知其能獲得昔日所鄭重允諾之平等權利始可、但此種保證端賴法國一國云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>俄報論軍縮　英國政策矛盾</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯政府公報伊斯維斯太報載蘇聯著名政論家拉狄克論軍縮一文、拉氏謂、「日内瓦已歷見多種會議之坍台、唯今日之問題、决非僅爲戰後數百種會議中一種會議之又一失敗可比、此事已成全歐或竟全世界政局之樞紐、蓋此項政局已到逹一種階段、卽日内瓦已能變成爲戰爭而作最後凖備之結晶點也、」拉氏詳論英法之地位云、「巴爾都與西門在軍縮大會上之演說、已以富有戲劇性之方式向全世界證明、卽戰後歐洲關係十五年來之發展、結果造成歐洲兩個領袖帝國主義國家政策間完全之歧異、」拉氏續謂、「德國帝國主義固在設法重返大會、而英帝國主義乃予被以在東歐及東南歐自由改變局面之可能、英帝國主義且予日帝國主義以在滿洲北部及東部自由行動之可能、英帝國主義公開提示各種凖備帝國主義戰爭之實力云、君等循此以行、决不致遭遇英帝國主義之阻撓也英國表面上雖稱願保衛法國、唯實際上被僅願保衛法國在歐洲之領土、其於法國之國際地位、則力謀破壞之且英之所以爲法國在歐領土而杞憂、僅以彼深懼法德疆界一旦變更、比利時亦將入於德國勢力範圍以内、此種局面不啻復有手槍凖對英國心腔矣、</p>
<p>英帝國主義復作如是想、卽彼於戰後雖已變弱、唯彼能起有美國在上屆大戰中所起之作用、卽彼能持續其中立之地位以積累巨金、嗣後乃加入戰爭而終止之於是而要求大宗漁利焉、唯美帝國主義憑賴此種政策、所得無幾、此已成常識英國之估計未能預見一部份歐洲及亞洲局面之情形、而此固不難表明者」云、（九日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）伊斯維斯太報社論題名「日内瓦之陰謀」該文稱、「蘇聯堅决保衛和平之行動、已引起現時最具侵略傾向之國家之憂懼、英國外交政府已動員一切方法、阻止和平得以蘇聯之參加與其巨大影響而組成、英外交政策一面已着手影響法國、一面則在柏林拉致德國重返大會、同時在薩爾公民投票問題上作種種讓步、彼之動員瑞典·那威·荷蘭·瑞士·西班牙諸國援助自己、已告勝利、而法國政府亦憂懼其對其他資本主義列强處於孤立地位、故已讓步、以圖在禁止德國擴張軍備問題上成立一種諒解、同時獲得英國於德國出而侵略時、將緩予援助之更多保障、或圖向一切搖曳不定者證明舉世實受德帝國主義之威脅、蘇聯捍衛和平之行動、暴露震撼世界之戰爭危機以及蘇聯對於被侵略國家組織國防之動議、舉凡此等理由、均令各國目擊、今日萬分嚴重之戰爭傾向、以及擁護若干列强之力量、此等列强當其前進也恒偃旗息鼓、而謀以惡化國際關係之責任、委諸他人肩上、夫如是乃能掩蓋其自身之政策、而以蘇聯實力日强之「危險」、令他國膽寒也、</p>
<p>「此等促進戰爭之徒之此種退讓、如能令帝國主義之擴張或戰爭之凖備稍稍延遲、則此項結果已得歸功於蘇聯之堅定與動議反之、如此種帝國主義列强之陰謀證明若輩代表擴張傾向之列强、其政策曾無所改愈、則卽在今日猶屬動搖之分子將惠信李維諾夫在日内瓦之提議、實爲增强安全之不二法門、</p>
<p>「蘇聯對於任何國家不謀衝突、同時對任何國家不論其爲德國或他國均不謀包圍、蘇聯並不參加外交陰謀、亦不締結同盟以嫌惡其他國家、蘇聯正爲和平而奮鬥、將來亦將以堅忍不變之精神繼續此種政策、蓋此種精神、乃爲蘇聯政策於各種與舉世各國生命利益有關塲合之特色」云、（九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>華沙　據此間私人所接立陶宛京城消息、本月六日該國京城發生之政變、與德國似非無關、蓋立陶宛輿論、現有一種運動、欲使立國與波蘭互相提携、（按兩國間因維爾諾城主權問題、齟齬已久、該城現歸波蘭佔領、）德國欲先發制人、俾此種運動不致實現、當政變暴發之時、米美爾區域德國居民聞訊、皆極感興奮、而該地立國人民則對於政變危機、頗表震驚云、立陶宛國斯美多那總統曾力求在波德兩國之間、保持自由地位、此間政界人士謂德國報界、對於立國事變、事前似已知情、因其曾於五月三十一日發表消息、說明米美爾區域德國人民處境之危險云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本政局混沌</h3>

<h3>蘇農行　擴充倉庫儲押　上年倉庫九十五所　本年擬擴充至一倍　儲押資金三百萬元</h3>
<p>鎭江訊、近年來農村經濟、凋敝已極、各方面咸注意於農業倉庫之舉辦、以備儲押農產品、江蘇省農民銀行辦理五年、平日對於儲押事業、極爲注意成績頗有進展、本年麥豆登塲後、價格亦必有自然跌落之趨勢、故倉庫儲押、刻不容緩、茲將該行辦理倉庫儲押情形、誌之如下、</p>
<p>倉庫情形　該行爲蘇省農村經濟之唯一調劑機關、溯自該行成立以來、除貸欵於農民爲生產上必要之資金外、復專力從事於農產倉、庫儲押之經營、希藉此以活動蘇省整個農村金融、故推廣倉庫儲押、實爲該行重要之政策、現該行自辦之倉庫計有三十八處、委託當地機關代辦者、計有三十二處、由合作社或農民敎育館代辦　者有二十五處、分佈於蘇州·常州·無錫·丹陽·江陰·吳江·靑浦·徐州·鹽城·如臯·等二十餘農產豐盛之縣、專司各該縣附近農產品之儲押、以資調節農產價格、而利農村金融之週轉、</p>
<p>儲押數量　該行各分行自辦及委託代辦之儲押倉庫計有九十五處、本年度儲押之、各種農產品數量、計逹五十萬零四千四百三十餘担、儲押總値爲一百二十八萬一千七百餘元、當此農村經濟破產、金融週轉不靈之時、得此鉅額資金、分散於各縣農村、雖未能一舉而使農村經濟抵於復興繁榮之境、但農村間之金融活動、週轉靈便、確已遠勝疇昔矣、</p>
<p>儲押種類　農村之主要產品爲米·榖·豆·麥·雜糧·蠶絲·棉花·豆餅·等類、蘇省位居東海之濱、長江横貫中部、運河縱流南北、水利之富、遠勝他省、故此類物產尤稱饒富、祇以價格慘跌、農村日趨破產、該行對於蘇省所屬各縣農產、米·榖·豆·麥·土絲·豆餅·棉花·等類、無不盡量儲押、統計該行各分行自辦及委託代辦之各倉庫、現在所儲押之農產品、以米榖爲最多、次爲豆·麥·豆餅·棉花·土絲·等、本年儲押數量、計米榖約二十五萬石、麥約三萬石、豆約三萬石、棉約二萬擔、豆餅約十萬片、又二萬餘石、絲約八千餘擔雜糧約一萬餘石、肥田粉約一千、五百担、布約三萬疋、</p>
<p>擴充計劃　聞該行除擴充已有之各縣倉庫外、現决繼續增設、力求推廣、並擬代各縣農業倉庫管理委員會辦理儲押事務、在本年内預計押稻榖等二百萬担、以三百萬元作爲儲押資金、在救濟整個農村經濟上說、其效雖不算十分宏大、但較之上年情形、當屬增加不少效果也、</p>

<h3>特載　桂省經濟調查印象記（續）</h3>
<p>— 千家駒</p>
<p>除了上述的原因外，我們千萬不能忘記還有一種重要的商業影響到梧州巿面的，那就是特貨業的衰落，所謂「特貨」，亦稱「土藥」，或「戒烟藥料」，均爲「鴉片」之别稱，鴉片業在廣西經濟上占着重要的地位，所謂重要，有兩種不同的意義，如雲南，貴州，等省，他們目前是靠「鴉片」生存的，他們要以鴉片來抵補入超，來與其他一切商品相交換，這實實在在是爲維持貿易平衡而必要的武器，丁文江先生曾說過一句話，「如果要禁止貴州不賣鴉片，除非禁止貴州人吃鹽」，（原文不復記憶，大意如此，）另外的許多省份，如廣西，廣東，四川，等省，鴉片僅在政府財政上占一重要的地位，廣西自己是絶封禁止種鴉片的，但牠却不失爲一個主要的通過碼頭，雲南貴州的烟，有三條路可以出口，（一）經桂入粤，（二）經湘之洪江入漢，（三）經四川出武漢，桂省的過境烟土，内十分之七爲貴土，十分之三爲滇土，每年通過的數量，最多時曾逹三千七百餘萬兩（民二十年），這種黄金時代，目下雖已過去，但近年過境之土，仍有二千餘萬兩之譜，過境烟土所以减少的原因，就是因爲受「内銷稅」的影響，怎麽呌做「内銷稅」呢，原來雲貴的烟土，來到廣西時，每千兩（一擔）徵收土藥稅五百元，八五折徵收，合四百二十五元，入廣東境時，又要徵稅五百元，但廣西的土，大部分是運粤銷售的，桂省烟土商爲避免粤省的重稅計，類多走私，此種走私之土，竟占二分之一，廣東政府，見稅收漏扈之鉅大，遂與廣西政府約，由廣西政府多徵收一重「内銷稅」卽凡烟土入桂，如係通過，僅徵通過稅五百元，如在桂省本地行銷，則加徵内銷稅二百五十元，這様凡雲貴烟土入桂境後，如要走私入粤，就當爲在桂行銷看待，就得多負担二百五十元的内銷稅了，而粤省則以拒絶洪江貨入口，爲桂設内銷稅之交換條件，私貨旣要多負担二百五十元之内銷稅，再加以運費與沿途的皮費，走私就得不償失了，私貨的價格，比正貨普通每千兩，要便宜百元，加上運費與保險費，每千兩約二百元，（正貨運費僅須百元）雖能偷漏五百元的正稅，但如加上内銷稅，也就與正稅所差無幾，而私貨沿途須冒風險，今獲利不豐，則無人肯做，因之私土絶跡，滇貴經桂轉運烟土，亦隨之而减少，原因不過如此，但是現在我們要問，爲什麽特貨業的衰落，便會影響到廣西全省的商業呢，這我們就要首先明瞭雲貴兩省的經濟情形，這兩省都是極窮而交通又最不發逹的省份，他們每年不得不輸出鴉片以換取本省必需的商品，梧州是滇黔一部分客貨輸出入的轉口碼頭，滇黔的商人，都把鴉片運到梧州來，由梧州出口到廣州去，再從梧州購買廣州香港的洋貨布疋，運回雲貴，所以鴉片就當爲交易的媒介，靠有鴉片，巿塲才活潑起來，如今鴉片减少，其他的商業，自然也隨着蕭條了，不僅是商業，卽違金融業之繁榮枯竭，也要以鴉片貿易之繁盛與否爲轉移，廣西最大兩個金融巿塲，丨梧州與南寗丨的金融機關，幾全以特貨行爲營業背景，這是再顯著沒有的事情，由鴉片一間題的考察中，我們又可以知道一個問題，决不能就牠本身孤立地來解决，在其他的種種經濟問題沒有獲得出路以前，禁止鴉片，結果終不過是具文吧了，</p>
<p>梧州又是廣西新式工業的發源地，（亦可說是唯一的集中地），兩廣琉璃廠（兩廣省政府合辦），梧州火柴廠，土製火油廠，紙烟廠，染布廠，製冰廠，鋸木廠，都設在這裏，此外還有建設廳辦的電力廠，與巿工務局辦的自來水廠，這裏最有趣味的，就是梧州丨雖然牠是廣西最大的都巿丨根本沒有像桂林柳州一帶我們所遇到的織土布業，這事實看似奇突，而其實是容易解釋的，梧州是廣西出入口的門户，是廣西資本主義的發祥地，牠與廣東相毘鄰，曾於光緒一十三年中英缅甸條約，闢爲商埠，資本主義的商品，首先打進廣西的，梧州是當心的一砲，凡是資本主義侵入的程度愈深的，舊式乎工業被摧毁的程度也愈深刻，在桂林與　林，靠着非人的工作條件與商業資本丨丨丨可驚的剥削方式，（稍後便當叙述）乎紡織業還能勉强地苟延殘喘着，梧州却連那様都不行了，機製的廉價的洋布，早已把乎紡的土布業打得「棄兵曳甲」「不見踪跡」了，資本主義生產方法的摧毁舊式的封建生產，還有比這更顯著的例證嗎，</p>
<p>說到梧州的琉酸廠，，當我們到梧州時，牠正在停工中，停工的原因，是極堪注意的，在說琉酸廠停工之前，我們是要說一說兩廣的土製火油廠，</p>
<p>所謂土製火油，就是把外國的原油ＣｒｕｄｅＯｉｌ運進來，在中國自」設廠煉成精製火油ＲｅｆｉｎｃｄＯｊｌ，這種工業，嚴格地說，是配不上稱「民族工業」的，因爲牠的原料，非仰給於舶來不可，不過牠較精製火油之直接輸入差强一籌的地方，就是原油倒底是半製品，牠是要在中國加工後，才成爲精製品的，這人工終是中國的人工，並且所投下有資本，也是中國人自己的資本，自從近幾年來金貴銀賤，煤油價格飛漲後，兩廣的土製火油業，風起雲湧，盛極一時，據說當一九三二年時，在廣州的土製火油廠，有二百三十餘家，在梧州也有二十多家，他們的資本，少的數千元，多的甚至逹數萬元，這種飛躍的發展，當然不是帝國主義的煤油公司所能忍受的，因之美孚，亞細亞，德思古，三公司，就聯合向我們傾銷了，煤油的價格，當前年八九月間，每罐賣七元五毛，至去年一月間，跌至六元五毛，二月更跌至五元二毛，五月更跌至三元九毛，另有經濟牌一種，售價僅及三元二毛，這様一來，土製火油的生命，就祇有宣告死刑了，因爲土製油的每罐成本，便要三元八角，所以廣州的二百三十多家火油公司，就倒閉了一百數十家，梧州的二十四家，則倒閉了廿二家，還有二家，也僅開工四分之一，合計僅等於半家開工而已，三公司除實行傾銷外，還用一種統計，來打擊土製火油業，他們將精製的火油，滲以一點淡黄色的藥粉，使他變成和原油差不多的顏色，這様經過中國海關時，就祇要納原料的稅，待將油質運到廣州後，便用壓力將藥粉沉澱下去，不費吹灰之力，便成精製油了，他們以這種方法，欺騙海關檢查員，同時以此來减輕成本，打擊土製火油業，以後廣東省政府爲救濟土製火油業計，在廣東舉辦煤油營業稅，每箱徵收銀三元，這自然是中西一律徵收的，但中國的火油商，却可以將這三元錢的稅票，去繳納海關稅，略示體貼之意，因之三公司的油，在廣東才較爲歛跡，但他們現在正在利用外交力量，大提抗議，壓迫中國政府取銷煤油特稅辦法，這問題如何解决，我們固不得而知，不過就以上事實觀察，帝國主義之於中國民族工業，正所謂操生殺之權了，</p>

<h3>曲木藏堯談　西南夷族情况　熟夷人口共三十餘萬　發展敎育爲開發先聲</h3>
<p>大白社云、中央特派川滇康夷族黨務宣傳員曁蒙藏會派赴西南夷族考察員曲木藏堯、爲夷族中之覺悟靑年、於民國二十年、由中央派往川滇康一帶、宣化夷族、並從事文化工作、改良夷族生活、早著成效、曲木氏於去年一月到京、向中央報告、、茲已公畢、由京來滬、候輪返川、大白社記者、昨訪於旅邸、詢以夷族情况甚詳、茲將所談、誌之如下、</p>
<h3>種族複雜</h3>
<p>據云、夷族種類、至爲雜複、然大槪可分爲黑夷與白夷二種、其他如水田、　　獏狻·曲曲·鳥夷·等族、以漸形淘汰爲數極少、故一般研究邊疆問題者、皆以黑白二夷族爲代表、其中以白夷人數最多、約佔十分之八九黑夷僅十分之一二、其生活語言文宇、黑·白·水田·三族大槪相似、　　·獏狻·曲曲·鳥夷、多居深山曠野、形同野人、故多爲黑白夷族所征服而同化、其所居之地段、介於川滇康之間、惟以四川之建昌道爲最多、茲就調查所得之人口、共計三三二·四二Ｏ人、惟單指投誠守法之熟夷而論、其他生夷人口尙未列入、</p>
<h3>原始生活</h3>
<p>至夷人生活、以其文化之低落、故極單純、男子四季僅着羊毛披　、（夷稱查爾瓦）或羊毛、其頭以長布纏裏爲帽、布之一端、在其頭角上、將毛髮一束、裏成長尖形、名曰「天菩薩」最忌諱他人用手擱之、身上常佩刀劍、護身符等、黑夷更佩麝牙包、以示威武、女子服飾、上穿套衫、下着長裙、惟不着褲、有時或披方巾、以黑白藍爲主、少女多繡以花紋、富者手足均帶金鐲、惟夷俗對於處女、尊重特甚、對於社會、有調停戰爭之權、家庭則負管理之責、夷人居住、常聚同支之黑夷白夷、與上古時之部落時代無差異、惟於衛生極不講究、甚至終年不洗臉換衣者、而迷信尤甚、一切皆以神爲主幸、貿易情形、多以物易物、僅較開化之熟夷地方、沿用大銀錠作爲貨幣、惟就生活方面言、尙與原始之共產社會同、不論酋長與奴隷、其享受毫無差異、如有乞丐、卽爲全族之恥辱、</p>
<h3>部落制度</h3>
<p>夷族之社會組織、純爲部落階級制度、黑夷以血統關係、民性倔强、其與白夷如中古封建時代之領主與奴隷者然、故常居統治地位、所謂白夷、大多皆爲被擄漢人、代彼服役、久而同化者、惟夷族同姓曰支、每支人數不等管理者多爲黑夷、（卽酋長）、其糾紛之處理、由土司衙門判决、但目前土司勢弱、夷人已不服從、惟夷族間各爲其部落之生存、常有據本支之勢力以消滅其他部落者、故戰爭之事、時有所聞、關於社會制裁、全依酋長個人之判斷、至於夷族語言、首注重於音之正確與否、然後再考義之是否滴當、但能認識文字、者則甚少、僅所謂兵母（宗敎師）·蘇利（亦宗敎師之一）能認識、至兵母與蘇利專爲唸經禳解之工作、故文字上之研究、亦僅限於符咒卜書之類、文字書法、極似德文、以鷄血合黑木炭、用竹籤書寫年月日之紀載、夷人不用歷法、僅用十二地支、記法卽以俗例之十二生辰爲例、</p>
<h3>宣化工作</h3>
<p>曲木氏最後表示、謂宣化夷族之主要工作、在於泯除其民族界限、打破漢夷隔膜之仇視心理、以促成民族之大團結、作西南國防之屏障、目前英法各帝國主義、正積極施行侵略我康·藏·滇邊之陰謀、故吾人對於邊疆問題、更不容絲毫忽視、故余（曲木氏自稱）於二十年至西康時、卽親往各地調查、并創辦化夷學校、惟以經費關係、僅開辦一期卽結束、惟余生爲夷人、深知當前急務、端賴敎育、因夷人之陷於野蠻狀態、而隔絶於漢人者、皆爲文化之落后、寗願焚掠度日、保存其原始生活、而不求進步、故在京時、曾與中央磋商夷族敎育實施計劃、冀藉此發展川滇康邊境夷族之文化、爲開發西南之先聲云、</p>
<h3>將有　華輪行駛國外　泳華輪卜月中抵滬開始</h3>
<p>日日社云、本埠大中華船船公司、爲闢國外航綫計、前特向英商愛特來公司購進商輪一艘、載重八千噸、已正式訂立合同、價約十餘萬元、定名爲泳華、該公司卽於月前、派該輪船主田雅爾、由滬乘太古公司湖北輪赴香港、再轉太平洋、至錫梨金山騐領、日日社記者、頃據該公司息、該輪將於下月中旬可抵滬、俟抵滬後、决定行駛上海至英屬北婆羅洲綫、裝載木材、查華商輪船、在五千噸以上者、爲數甚少、其行駛國外航綫、尤屬罕見云、</p>

<h3>褚輔成氏談　今年浙江養蠶情形</h3>
<p>茶葉與生絲、佔我國出口品之重要部份、茶葉巿塲、近來幾被印度及日本搶奪殆盡、而絲業更一蹶不振、卽國内之消費者、亦多採用舶來品之人造絲、該業前途、深堪悲哀、記者昨晨訪問褚輔成氏、詢其今年浙江蠶絲情形、茲將其談話詳紀如次、</p>
<h3>今年產繭數量</h3>
<p>褚氏首謂、今年浙江蠶種、改良種與土種各半、改良種之繭價每担二十三元、僅及最貴時每六十元二分之、故農民大感痛苦、桑葉每担一元五角、繭每擔食桑葉十五擔計、已無贏餘、但較無錫桑葉、每擔三元、尙得少賠本錢、故目前育蠶、毫無利益可圖、浙省今年出產鮮繭、約計一千萬擔、絲每擔平均鮮繭十三担、或乾繭四担半、成本須五百元、而世界之標凖生絲巿價、美爲四百六十元、法爲五百二十元、而日本僅四百八十元、論及我國之產絲量八年僅十餘萬担、日之產額、乃七十餘萬担、且價廉物美、世界巿塲、竟被其獨佔、</p>
<h3>外傳日購華絲</h3>
<p>繼稱浙民農民、不願採用改良種之原因有二、（一）浙江育蠶者、多能繅絲、故良種之繭、不如土種之易繭、（二）農民縱然以不純熟技術所繅得之改良種生絲、亦易被繭商剥削、彼等以廉價收買、如此不良制度、亦爲蠶種改七上之大障礙、外傳日本欲擾亂我國巿塲、收買華絲、恐係臆度之辭、緣日絲價格、較華絲廉、世上斷無如此蠢事、然在山東方面、或可實現、蓋目前山東之秤、每斤依然一十四兩、斤量上可佔、宜、而江浙之巿秤、早已改爲每斤十三兩六錢矣</p>
<h3>設絲業交易所</h3>
<p>最後褚氏曰、邇來謠傳絲商要求政府、再發絲業公債、實屬不確、至於成立交易所問題、須視予（褚氏）呈請政府之絲業推廣海外巿塲及統制國内產品之方案、能否核准而定、苟政府認爲無統制之必要、則成立絲業交易所、自由貿易、實有相當之可能性、</p>

<h3>再論匯劃制度之應否廢除</h3>
<p>— 馮以圭</p>
<p>關於匯劃制度應否廢除之一問題、不侫亦嘗爲文討論之矣、乃論者復摭拾陳言、旁及細瑣、以張其說、冀動視聽、而於事實之眞相如何、漫不加察、識者惜焉、夫美玉重在琢磨、明鏡貴乎拂拭、不侫亦　幸眞理之愈辯而愈明也、爰復草是篇、</p>
<p>今之主張廢除匯劃制度者、豈不曰民九高唱廢兩之際、時賢早有「廢兩改元先自廢匯劃銀始」之文、刋登報章、以明其非自我倡乎、然吾人卽就此一點推論、卽足證其說之不能成立、夫當時之主張廢兩者、豈不曰匯劃銀爲廢兩之最大障礙、不廢匯劃銀、决不能逹廢兩之目的、吾人雖告以廢兩之障礙、不在匯劃銀、而在銀幣之供給不足與時機之未至、顧終無以解一部分人士之惑、荏苒十餘年時異世遷、廢兩改元、卒於上海造幣廠開鑄之後、順利成功、有若水到渠成之妙、而滙劃制度之行使如故也、吾人當時爭持之苦心、於以大白、而匯劃制度是否爲廢兩之惟一障礙、是否空言卽可廢除、不難與天下人以共見、今論者摭拾陳言、以明其說之有所本、夫舊說尙不能成立、遑論依附於舊說之高調耶、</p>
<p>論者或舉本年五月中旬上海之存底數字以證籌碼鬆濫、逹於極點、大可及時改革、此等燕雀處堂之見解、當非明逹者所敢苟同、據關册所示、六七年來、貨物與生銀均爲入超、獨去年貨物仍爲入超、而生銀一變而爲出超、按之上海存底在往年生銀入超時、初未見其增多、而於生銀頻頻流出時、轉覺其鬆濫、此等反常情勢之形成、完全因内地農村破產、現金集中都巿所致、比來政府方努力全國經濟建設、而上海銀行界亦爭以投瓷農村爲已任、推行頗著成效、行見農村經濟、漸呈昭蘇、屆時集中上海之現金、勢必復歸歸農村、是現金一方面向國外流出、一方面向内地輸送、有不感受籌碼不敷者乎、復次、目下華商銀行存底、雖逹二萬萬元、除去發行凖備之外、復有幾何可資運用、一旦巿面緊張、能否從容應付、要不能不加以考慮、至軟幣信用之佳、正因硬幣凖備之充足所致、否則、殆難言之矣、要之吾人不能因一時籌碼之鬆濫而不思來日之六難、前車不遠、來軫可知、竊願與論者共勉焉匯劃制度對於華商各界、根本無損失可言、不侫亦旣言不、乃論者以洋商對於隔日收現之虧耗、已暗加於貨價之上爲慮、然則發行銀行以七天十天招徠領劵、實際所蒙之利息損失、將謂亦由金融業以外之人負担之耶、至謂商家交易售出商品、所得者爲當日匯劃票、一方購進商品、必須現欵帶往外埠、勢必出於貼現、是卽虧耗一日之利息云云、此殆未明上海商情者之所言、蓋商家儘可將莊票付入往來行莊、一方卽可提取現洋、何至有一日之虧耗、以近來行莊開户之便凡稍有商業常識者、幾皆熱諳此項乎續、若以一二小商家不明此習爲念、則鈔劵之授受、亦將爲之抱憂誤受僞鈔之損失矣、若卽因此而廢止發行、可乎否耶、至論者更調、錢業當時未能早與一般直接間接之在經濟侵略下交易者、斷絶往來、否則其收穫當較匯劃制度爲尤多云云、此等言論、似非吾人所欲研究、夫貿易自由、以英·美·法·德·之强盛、亦只能高築關稅　　以自保、何况吾國、又何况錢業、此匯劃制度之始終不失爲抵制經濟侵略之惟一防綫也、</p>
<p>或謂匯劃制度之存在、足使錢業在劃頭加水上壟斷、然則國内匯兌、各地匯水、每日升降無定吾人亦將謂由銀行業壟繼耶、此凡知經濟學上之供求律者、必知其言之不經也、至謂匯劃制度、可使錢莊吸收銀行頭寸、姑無論「最近巿上游資充斥、錢蔣對於銀行存項、「並不歡迎」、誠如論者之言、卽使錢莊渴欲羅致銀行欵、亦决不能恃滙劃制度强迫銀行存放、蓋信任或存放與否、其權完全操之銀行、銀行不願存放、錢莊不能强求、亦猶錢莊不願收受、銀行不能强迫也、猶憶二年前、時賢討論廢兩改元之際、或謂錢莊全恃銀兩生存、藉以吸收銀行存欵、一旦銀兩廢除、銀行無須再存欵於錢莊、屆時錢莊將無以自存云云、吾人當時卽力闢其謬、並舉錢莊開業、早於銀行數十年爲證、今者廢兩瞬逾一年、銀行之存欵於錢莊如故、而錢莊之繁榮、轉加盛於昔、吾人方幸事實之垂示、歷歷不爽、因不必逞雄辯而徒費唇古也、</p>
<p>尤有言者、目下銀行林立、其採用匯劃制度者固比比皆是、卽中交兩行、近亦紛紛設立分支行、改用匯劃、以取便於主顧、是可見匯劃制度、自有其特出之點、亦足以證明匯劃制度之眞價値矣、至謂促進金融業整個之合作、不佞以爲儘可由少數採用劃頭銀洋之銀行、自動廢棄劃頭銀洋、俾全體華商銀行與錢業間、一律以匯劃銀洋進出、則對外固可一致、而對内亦自趨於統一矣、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論生活的矛盾（四）</h3>
<p>今日是以上三次討論總結，但因</p>
<p>限於篇幅，祇得簡略的提示了幾</p>
<p>個要點。好在我們的討論生活是</p>
<p>多方面的，不足不够之處有機會</p>
<p>時再爲補出。編者</p>
<p>五，怎様克服行爲上的矛盾</p>
<p>生活的矛盾都可克服的嗎？克服生活上的矛盾是否不是否認生活過程的矛盾性？不！一點也不！生活上的矛盾原則的說可以包含有相對與絶對的兩種。絶對的矛盾是不能克服的。譬如以前君主時代的貴族與農奴，在少數貴族的頭腦中，雖然萬分同情農奴，發生與自己身份不同的思想的矛盾，但是這種同情是有限度的，等到自己的農奴反叛時，他的腦中仍然會生出鎭壓叛亂是眞理。這是說明這種絶對的矛盾不能克服的。反之，如果農奴他在某一時期吸取了貴族的思想，雖然在他的思想上一時呈出與原來他的身份的思想矛盾，但這矛盾是相對的，因爲他的生活條件終有一天會使他覺悟。再，如中間階級的腦中有時也會生出同情下等階級的思想，只要這一階級是遠到沒落的階段了，他這時思想上的矛盾也成爲了相對的矛盾，也是可以克服的。克服生活上的矛盾是引到這相對的矛盾，利用這矛盾使行爲上消减矛盾的現象，使生活發展。這並不是否認矛盾，因爲相對的矛盾仍然是矛盾，仍然是不斷的存在的。</p>
<p>但我們要怎様來克服這些矛盾呢？</p>
<p>我們知道，做和尙的人，他們生活上最大的矛盾是性的矛盾。（生理方面的矛盾，都不是絶對的矛盾）因爲食色性也，做和尙的人雖然准許食慾存在，性慾卻是絶對排棄的。他們到底都是肉人，他們仍有性的要求。然而，他們是如何去克服這種「本能」呢？我們知道，他們採用的方法，在觀念上是用「不凈觀」，在日常生活則有「誦經」及非常嚴厲的戒規，我們在每　　大的廟宇内都可看到刋碑勒石的戒規，上面刻着禁止鷄奸，不准同小和尙同床等宇句，違反了這種淸規，小則受笞，大則驅逐出廟。自然這些方法是壓抑，不是克服。因爲不凈觀雖然說女人是如何汚穢，如何不凈，女人剥掉了皮肉是如何可怕，醜惡，但實實在的女人並不如此，她確是温柔，艷美，可愛在與不凈觀說明的剛剛相反，所以不凈觀在觀念上不能有克服一「性慾」的能力，至於「淸規」森嚴，反祇說明了這種矛盾的加激。和尙生活並不如一般想像的干净，他們的矛盾不過被袈裟掩罩住了，何嘗能談到克服。</p>
<p>父母對於兒女，師長對於學生也常常採用極厲的手段去克服子女或學生的生活上的矛盾，結果，常常適得其反。我們又在許多個人奮鬥失敗的叙述中，看見大半由於採用方法的錯誤，不能將生活矛盾引導到正道去。</p>
<p>這些錯誤的發生都是由於否認生活過程的矛盾性，因此，以爲行爲上的矛盾是可由壓抑或主觀的去鎭伏的。實則這是大錯。要克服行爲上的矛盾先要懂得矛盾的根源，把這一問題在發展中去理解。</p>
<p>比如就一個思想與行動不能統一的人說，你要克服這種分裂，應取如何的道路呢？我們覺得，這不是你的立志，宣誓，是你生活，你如果主張「回農村去」，「回農村去」是你的理想，但你的日常生活習慣使你不能過農村生活，你就得在未到農村前先將自己的生活簡單化，習慣勞苦，或短期的住到農村去，或者竟長期的到農村去生活，學習農村中的一切你不熟習的生活。如果你的實生活是農村的了，你的理論自然只會前進，思想與行動自會統一。</p>
<p>克服一種矛盾，不是一朝一夕的。要防止自己墮落，要在平日與各種不良的生活相抗戰。中國有句俗話，「將必自腐也，而後蟲生之」。要不生蟲，須先得防腐。一個人的墮落大致是不知不覺沉陷下來的，比如一個口裏高談大衆利益的人思想上或者接受一種最前進的思想，面在私生活方面是貴族一般的生活，這種私生活一定要引他的言論與行動不統一，　大二者間的矛盾，使他去向相反的道路。這是因爲構成他的生活的矛盾間的比重向下的超過向上的了，一旦逹到一定程度，他就會發生猛烈的改變了。我們要將這種矛盾引之向上，祇有增强「向上」的矛盾的比重。就是在私生活上常常保持與思想的一致，緊忍的與向下的矛盾相戰鬥。這纔是唯一防腐的方法。</p>
<p>思想與思想間矛盾的克服正確的道路是要誤思想的發展，不能停在某一階段上。因爲停止就是增長向下的矛盾的比重及發展的機會。促成思想發展是將客觀實踐上新的東西統實自己的思想裏去，使自己思想更體系化，具體化，實際化。</p>
<p>至於行動間的矛盾，祇要是後者比前者的進步，行動的不一致是無可非議的。反之，就是向下的發展。堅定行爲的向下首先是堅定自己的思想的向上與社會實踐保持同一速度的認議的向上。</p>
<p>克服生活中任何領域矛盾，是加强矛盾的冲激，造成向上的矛盾制伏向下的矛盾的條件。但克服的路程這是因人而異的。有的人在短的期間内可以將生活改造，有的人卻要走很長的道略，費很多的時間。一個人應永遠抱着自己是生活的學習者，要隨時隨地去檢閱腦中所攝取的影片，因爲這些由感覺所得來的知識，它是構成你的思想的原料，它有的是很富滋養的，也有消蝕生命力的毒素。而這些印象都是由不知不覺中滲入你的思想，影響你的行爲。所以一個靑年應該知道墮落是由不知不覺而向下的發展，同時向上的發展也不能一朝而至，也是由艱難困苦的奮鬥纔遠到的。</p>
<p>人的生活過程是矛盾的，矛盾促你生活開展，也可使你的生活枯萎·人在矛盾中生長。也在矛盾中死滅。要把握正確的人生，是不長矛盾，不長與矛盾戰鬥，人的生活最怕的是停止在一種中和的狀態中，人的生活必然是戰鬥的連續祇有能戰勝向下的矛盾的人綫是人生的勝利者。（完）</p>

<p>體育新聞</p>
<h3>國立醫學院長顏福慶助　邱飛海組上海網球會　合同簽訂在體恊會未得通知書前</h3>
<p>整個運動塲收回體育界受重大打擊</p>
<p>勞神父路中華全國體育恊進之全部運動塲、已由地主美國煤油大王基金團捐贈國立上海醫學院建築醫院及醫學院之用、體恊會方面、於本月結束遷讓、醫學院方面則於七月一日起正式接收、惟醫學院數年來所籌經費、尙不滿百萬、故建築工程、一時尙難實現、且以地皮過多、卽使建造醫學院及醫院亦無須如此巨大地域、乃將一部份轉租他人、如西面足球塲之租於法工部局、南面網球塲之租給邱飛海繼續經營網球會等、但醫學院不予體育恊進會之優先租借權、深引起體育界之不滿、至於邱飛海之計劃、今已成功、定名爲上海網球會、茲將詳情探錄如下、</p>
<h3>秘密進行</h3>
<p>上海網球會之組織動機、早已在參加遠東運動會之前　而事前邱飛海與上海醫學院方面、已有相當接洽、在邱君實無從得知塲地上收回、卽在目前而醫學院之供獻於邱君、爲極顯明之事實、據恊進會幹事周家騏談、在我國選手團赴菲途中、邱君曾與其談及此事、周頗驚以爲異、蓋事前極未知悉、用以詢沈嗣良君、沈君亦毫未得聞其事、不料返抵上海、恊進會遷讓之通知書、旣卽收到、而上海網球會之合同、亦以簽字聞矣、甚矣、其乎術之敏捷、</p>
<h3>父女關係</h3>
<p>邱飛海之接租中華網球會地皮、一說係邱之知友陳炳章爲其接洽又一說、此事之主力、仍屬於醫學院院長顏福慶、因陳炳章之夫人顏雅卿女士、卽顏福慶之女、而邱與陳君夫婦、夙甚莫逆、邱之接租該地皮、可謂全係顏雅卿女士在其乃翁面前一言之功、合同暫爲五年、五年後如雙方同意、仍可繼續九年、至於租費、直有等於無耳、</p>
<h3>招致會員</h3>
<p>邱接乎後、改名爲上海網球會、已在各方面招致會員、除華人外、西人被邀加入者、亦有多人、每年會費三十元、女會員减半、擬建一小規模之會所、分辦公室、更衣室、休息室及浴室等、塲上一切用具及看台等、向體育恊進會估價購下、其將來之計劃、與體恊會方面、曾有相當接洽、如體恊會主辦之扶輪盃上海萬國網球賽等、仍得在該塲舉行、草地聯賽中之中華會、亦仍得在該塲比賽、</p>
<h3>將來計劃</h3>
<p>網球塲之面積、如全部建築球塲、可有二三十口之多、但限於經費、不能全部建造、原有草地球塲六隻、硬地球塲四只、本年略加修葺不再擴充、來年起、擬共建草地場十隻、由貝勒路方面開一大門出入、冬令並擬架一室内球塲、作羽球比賽之用云、</p>
<h3>體協表示</h3>
<p>據協進會負責人表示、醫學院之出租塲地、恊進會方面未得優先租借權、引爲遺憾、恊進會對於所有各塲地、不能加以整頓者、全因無時不在風雨飄搖之中、蓋洛氏基金團隨時可將地皮收回、如或加以整理、倘遷讓通知　隨之而來、豈非全屬虚費、苟能得如上海網球會之五年至十年之租借合同、則恊進會方面、亦非不願投以資金、加以修葺、决不願令其如今日之衰頽荒廢之若是也、此不特協進會之挫折、亦上海體育界之巨大影響也、言之不勝悵悵、</p>

<h3>傷寒發揮二（下）</h3>
<p>— 余籌岫</p>
<p>其主傷寒傳足不傳手之說者。張子和傷寒心鏡曰。「傷寒只傳足六經。仲景本論無說。古今亦無言者。惟龐安常謂陽主生。故足太陽水傳足陽明土。土傳足少陽木。爲微邪。陰主殺。故木傳足太陰土。士傳足少陰水。水傳足厥陰木。爲賊邪。蓋牽强附會。胡不觀内經陰陽離合論曰。太陽根起於至陰。名陰中之陽。陽明根起於厲兌。名曰陰中之陽。少陽根起於竅陰。名曰陰中之少陽。太陰根起於隱白。名曰陰中之陰。少陰根起於湧泉。名曰陰中之少陰。厥陰根起於大敦。名曰陰之絶陰。其次序正於此合。」此則以陰陽離合論之次序。爲傷寒傳經之次序也。然陰陽離合論之次序。亦極雜亂。無理由可言。何足據之以爲證乎。且不過足經次序相合而已。而於只傳足經不傳手經之事亦未有說以處之也。彼譏龐安常爲牽强附會。此得非牽强附會耶。</p>
<p>又曰「以六氣考之。厥陰爲初之氣。少陰爲二之氣。太陰爲三之氣。少陽」</p>
<p>爲四之氣。陽明爲五之氣。太陽爲終之氣。此順也。逆而言之。正與此合。緣傷寒爲病。逆而非順也。」此則更牽强矣。至劉草窗則謂」足之六經。屢水木士。皆不勝寒氣所傷。故水遇寒則涸而冰。木遇寒則葉落枝枯。士遇寒則坼而不堅。手經所屬。皆金與火。金與火不畏寒。故金遇寒則愈堅。又火體極熱。寒不能襲」云云。此則完全以五行性氣爲說。且謬傷寒爲眞屬寒邪所傷之病。其立論之無理可笑。不待明言也。</p>
<p>然則河間官明論曰。「熱論又曰。三陰三陽五臟六腑皆受病。營衛不行。五臟不通。則死矣。」未嘗止傳足經。不傳手經。</p>
<p>陶節庵曰。「傳足不傳手。此庸俗之謬論。豈有是哉。人之充滿一身。無非血氣所養。畫夜循環。運行不息。焉有止行於足。不行於手之理乎。·····</p>
<p>蓋風木之令。起於大寒節　正當十二日中。至春分後。方行温令。故風寒亦能傷之。足陽明太陰。中土也。與冬時無預。而亦受傷寒者。緣士無定位。無成名。無專氣。寄王於四時。能始終萬物。故四時寒熱温凉之氣。皆能傷之也。····手之六經。主於夏秋。故不傷也。足之六經。蓋受傷之方分境界也。若言傷足不傷手則可。以爲傳足不傳手。則不可也」。此蓋言受病在足經。旣病之後。則無所不傳也。雖能知傳足不傳手之謬。然所持傷足不傷手之論。亦本於五行四時爲說也。</p>
<p>李梴醫學入門。亦宗節庵傷足不傷手之說。而其論傳足不傳手則曰。「上古止分三陰三陽。而不分手足。」又曰。「手足三惿。同手走頭至足。手足三陰。同足走胸腹與手。豈有經絡同而受病又有不同者哉。</p>
<p>張景岳作類經。其註傷寒熱論篇。卽本李梴之意而暢言之也。曰。一傷寒傳變。止言足經。不言手經。其義本出此篇。奈何草窗劉氏。不明其理。遂謬創傷寒傳足不傳手之說。謂足經所屬皆水木土。水寒則冰。木寒則凋。土寒則坼。是皆不勝其寒也。手經所屬皆金與火。金得寒則愈堅。火體極熱而寒不能襲。所以傷寒只傳足經。不傳手經。巧言要譽。昧者稱奇。妄誕欺人。莫此爲甚。夫人之金火兩藏。不過以五行之氣。各有所屬耳。豈卽眞金眞火。不能毁傷者耶。斯言一出。遂起人疑。致有謂足經在下。手經在上。寒本陰邪。故傳足也。有謂足之六經。皆束北方及四隅之氣。手之六經。皆西南方之氣。寒氣中人。必在冬春。同氣相求。故先自水經以及木土。而金火則無犯也。有謂無奇經則無傷寒。奇經惟附於足也。紛紛議論。爭辯不明。其說皆謬。夫人之血氣。運行周身。流注不息。豈傳遇手經而邪有不入者哉」。此乃駁傳足不傳手之說。卽本諸河間節庵之說而推衍之也。</p>
<p>景岳又曰。「然本經之不言手者。何也。蓋傷寒者。表邪也。欲求外證。但當察於周身。而周身上下脈絡。維足六經則盡之矣。手經無能徧也。且手經所至。足經無不至者。故但言足經。則其左右前後陰陽諸證。無不可按而得。而手經亦在其中。不必言矣。此本經所以止方足者。爲察周身之表證也。」此乃辨内經言足不言手之義。卽本李梴之說。而言之更明耳。。然十二經行次部伍。内經所說。無一不謬。已詳拙著靈素商兄。是故凡根據經絡行次部伍以爲說者。亦無一不謬。其根本先撥故也。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三）（十）（一）破傷風　　問　什麽呌做破傷風？</p>
<p>答　這是因爲創傷而傳染的一種傳染病。</p>
<p>問　破傷風病原菌是誰發見的，形態怎様？</p>
<p>答　是Ｎｉｃｏａｉｒ氏發見的，係一種桿狀菌，一端有鞭毛，能稍運動，一端有菌幅三四倍大的芽胞。</p>
<p>問　　這病原菌存在於什麽地方呢？</p>
<p>答　破傷風病原菌，存在於馬矢·牛矢·以及泥土裏面。</p>
<p>問　破傷風病初起時症狀怎様？</p>
<p>答　傳染之後，經過四天到十四天的潛伏期，方始發病，初起的症狀，從下頷，顏面和頸部訴緊張甚至硬直感；因爲咬肌的强直性痙攣致上下牙床緊咬，不能開口，這呌做牙關緊急，其後，强直波及到面肌，於是前額的縐襞和鼻唇溝著明呈苦笑狀。再波及到頸肌脊肌，於是脊柱向前方或後方彎曲，這呌做前弓反張後弓反張。倘波及到四肢和軀幹的時候，那末身體成棒狀直綫，迅呌做直立伸張，此外，有腹壁陷沒，像板狀堅硬的。也有因爲肋間肌强直而成吸氣位的。</p>
<p>問　除了這些症候之外，還有什麽主要症狀？</p>
<p>答　除了這些强硬性肌肉症狀之外，還有因爲神經系的反射性亢進之故，所以遇到一些輕微刺戟，像光綫，風吹，雜響或身體動搖等，便起於疼痛性痙攣發作。</p>
<p>問　皮膚的知覺，受影響麽？</p>
<p>答　皮膚的知覺，完全照常；但反射亢進而發汗和涙液的分泌也亢進。</p>
<p>問　病人的體温脈搏和呼吸怎様？</p>
<p>答　體温在初期稍上昇，發作痙攣之後，便起高熱，脈搏頻數，呼吸困難。</p>
<p>問　小便和大便怎様？</p>
<p>答　大小便都减少。</p>
<p>問　這種病持續多小時間？</p>
<p>答　大都經過一二星期，但也有很快的，也有很慢的。</p>
<p>問　破傷風的危險程度怎様？</p>
<p>答　凡潛伏期愈短，愈是危險。死亡率有百分之六十到九十。</p>
<p>問　治療破傷風的方法怎様？</p>
<p>答　把創傷部切開，或切除。有時要把病肢截去。在早期可注射破傷風血淸一百單位於創傷部附近的肌肉内或胸部皮下。有時可注射於靜脈内或脊柱内。痙攣發作的時候，注射硫酸鎂液於脊髓内或靜脈内，也可注射於皮下或肌肉内。此外内服鎭靜劑像臭化鉀「Ｉ、ｕｍｉｎａｌ」水化　酫等。</p>

<p>答　初起畏光，流涙，上下臉粘合，有時略帶疼痛，視物不淸，臉結合膜滿佈粒或莿。病久，結合膜組織過長，而縮緊，臉裂較常更小。</p>
<p>問　生痧眼何以視物不淸？</p>
<p>答　一因角膜生似膠之血管組織，名角膜絡，翳朦蔽角膜，一因角膜瘍，致起角膜瘢痕症輕上下臉因粒莿磨擦眼球，生似膠之涙液，而起視物不明。</p>
<p>問　痧眼傳染的路徑是怎様的？</p>
<p>答　痧眼的病原體至今尙未知曉，其傳染路徑，大抵由已患痧眼者，不知顧忌，數人其用巾盆，因而傳染。故浴堂，旅館，軍營，學校，茶肆，酒坊，均爲傳染此病之原，而公用賭具，傳染此症者，亦不在少數。</p>
<p>問　痧眼遷延不治，結果若何？</p>
<p>答　此症早醫，大抵無害，若遷延不治，則臉漸改形，角膜生瘍，或生翳，睫毛倒歪，磨激角膜，終至失明。</p>
<p>問　怎様方能防止痧眼？</p>
<p>答　常用硼酸水洗眼，勿履灰塵之地，並調節飲食，早眠早起，多吸淸氣，常運動，巾盆宜獨用，公共者，寗願摒棄不用。卽旅行他埠，亦宜隨帶巾盆，以免傳染，賭博尤易傳染此症，而麻雀較甚。蓋多人雜處，以手摸牌，難免無是症流傳也。倘每日常以消毒肥皂洗手，則對於預防上，較爲可恃。</p>

<h3>素食之益</h3>
<p>— 米勒耳</p>
<p>上海療養衛生院院長米勒耳博士，於本月三日在西人華美電台演講，題爲素食之益，茲錄其提倡素食之理由如左：</p>
<p>（一）體所需之一切滋養料，蔬果五榖中無不俱備，肉類則爲間接之食物，其所含營養品，皆從植物中得來，且不完全，蔬菜中所含之礦質及維他命，肉食中尤極缺乏，故不如素食爲佳。</p>
<p>（二）肉食中常含種種病菌以及動物體中必有之廢料與汁，危害人身至鉅，食肉之人，最易患毒瘤，皮膚症，肝毒，頸腺腫，腎中生石，血管變硬，痛瘋，以及各種腸胃症，食素之人，卽無此種危險，蓋蔬菜非毒菌滋生之地也。</p>
<p>）蔬菜五糓，較肉食易於消化多矣，其中所含原料，於口中咀嚼時卽起消化作用，故愈嚼而愈覺甘美，肉則反之，其所含成分，不能在口中消化，故愈嚼而愈覺淡澀無味。</p>
<p>（四）食肉者每易患肝部與腎部之症，蓋肝與腎，專司消化蛋白質及排除廢料之職，肉食之中，含蛋白質極多，含其他養料則不足，且多廢料，故易使肝與腎負担過重，而遭虧損。</p>
<p>（五）獸畜食蔬榖八磅，方可長一磅之肉，但一磅蔬菜，卽較一磅之肉多三倍之滋養料，故肉類之滋養料，卽較蔬菜之滋養料價昻二十五倍。</p>
<p>（六）肉類較蔬菜易於腐敗，腐敗之肉，較腐敗之蔬菜更足危害人體，且腐敗之肉較腐敗之蔬菜更難覺，故欲免危險，莫如戒肉，尤於夏季爲然。</p>
<p>（七）肉類因有毒汁與廢料，易使人感煩燥困　之意。食素之人，必較食肉之人强壯而壽長，此爲無可異議之事實。</p>
<p>（八）食肉最可取之點，卽爲其味之可口，但人之口胃，亦不過習慣耳，實則肉類之味，蔬菜中無不有之，在乎調裝之得法與否。</p>
<p>以上數端，不過舉其大者要者，他若素食之足以使人常有一種淸潔衛生之感覺，愉快之身心，敏捷之思想，及對疾病具强烈之抵抗力，尤其餘事。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二）衂血</p>
<p>講到衂血兩個字。就是指鼻内出血而言。在醫學上就呌做Ｅｐｉｓｔａｘｉｓ。不論男女老少。人人都有遇到的機會。因爲他容易治好。所以大家不當做什麽一回事。如果出血有兩三天不止的時候。方才去請敎醫生。我們中國家庭一般素來相信用來止血的法子，就是用紙團或棉花蘸了陳墨。塞入鼻腔。他的止血理由。據說墨的原料是從松烟和膠質混合製成的。松烟含有炭質。可促進血液的凝固。膠質富有粘性　像西藥Ｇｅｌａｔｉｕｅ一様的具有凝血之效。在鄕村間遇有衂血時。大都不用墨來止血。只用草紙或植物的葉子。來塞鼻孔。有時也可奏效。不過往往用了上面說的治法。照様不能止血。或者常常再發。這是什麽道理呢？我現在把他的理由說說明白。請諸位聽着吧。從我們醫學上說起衂血來。先要知道他的發生原因。是局部的關係呢。還是全身的關係。治療的目標亦因此不同。就是第一先止血（治標）。第二務必探根求源。搜索原因（治本）我現在先把局部的原因。寫在左面。</p>
<p>（一）創傷性衂血　屬於這一類的衂血，（一）比拳跌仆時，用外力打擊鼻部。使鼻粘膜受直接或間接的損傷而來出血。（二）頑皮小孩時常有一種用指爪掻抓鼻孔的習慣。這種習慣容易使鼻粘膜反復受到外力的刺戟。從刺戟變成小創面而出血。（三）鼻腔内行手術時。常常亦要發生創傷性衂血。這是醫生責任上的事體。還有一種創傷性衂血。也是從手術而來的。就是（四）在江北一帶鄕民。因爲寳貴他的孩子起見。在鼻孔當中的鼻中隔前面。（鼻中隔是隔成鼻腔爲兩個鼻孔的一塊骨。前部是軟骨。後部是硬骨）。鑽一個洞。套上一個圈圈。這時候當然免不了一次衂血。</p>
<p>（二）鼻腔發生局部病變而來的衂血（一）患乾燥性前鼻炎時。鼻中隔前部的粘膜表面。往往附着粘稠液體。吸入灰塵。容易乾燥。結面痂皮。鼻内感覺瘞癢和乾燥。所以常用手指掻抓鼻孔。剥離痂皮。引起衂血。這種病在泥水匠·礦工·化學廠工人等。比較容易生些。（二）爲局部病變中好發衂血的部位。就是克山兒氏部ＬｏｃｕｓＫｉｅｓｅｌｄａｃｈｕ。這個部位是在鼻中隔的前端軟骨處。此處的粘膜狠薄。有許多擴張的毛細脈管。遇着輕微的損傷或血壓增高的時候。此種毛細脈管容易破裂出血。上面所說的（一）（二）兩項出血。也是在這個部位最多。我們做醫生遇到了衂血病人。第一要緊檢查的地方。也就是這個部位。一般人用棉花蘸陳墨或僅用棉花塞在鼻孔前部。就可止血的道理。也是因爲這個部位最容易出血的緣故。所以我可提這個部位呌做衂血泉。</p>
<p>（三）因鼻腔·副鼻腔·或鼻咽腔發生腫瘍而來的衂血。像癌腫·肉腫·鼻咽·織維腫·或出血性鼻中隔茸腫等。都容易來衂血的。上面說的衂血。都是從局部的原因而來的。現在又要講到全身的原因。所謂全身的原因就是因全身的病。譬如有血管壁變狀的病。或血壓增進的病。都可容易發生衂血的。我現在把有這幾種病變的疾病。舉列在左面。論到各個疾病的詳細症候。是不講了。</p>
<p>（一）血液和造血器官的疾病。如貧血·萎黄病·惡性貧血·白血病·及假性白血病等。</p>
<p>（二）傳染性疾病。如鼻腔白喉·腸梯扶斯·再歸熱·腥紅熱·麻疹·水痘·惡性瘧疾·膿毒性疾病·遺傳梅毒等。</p>
<p>（三）出血性疾病。如壞血病·血友病·紫斑病等。</p>
<p>（四）中毒。如燐中毒·急性黄色肝萎縮症等。</p>
<p>（五）血壓减進的疾病。如動脈硬化症·腎臟炎·萎縮腎等。</p>
<p>（六）心臟疾病（如大動脈瓣閉鎖不全症），肺臟疾患（如肺氣腫），激烈的咳嗽（如百日咳），及多血質等。</p>
<p>還有一種所謂代償性衂血。是指代償性月經而言。俗間呌做倒經。就是月經來潮的時候。發生多量的衂血。此時月經反少。或竟沒有月經。什麽道理。現在還沒有知道呢。</p>
<p>衂血的症候和他的預防法及急救法。待下期續刋。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第四章　肺結核之演進</p>
<p>（三）第三種是從血管系統的蔓延。淋巴腺結核的結果，發現石灰變性狀態是很多的；這様一來，他的進展當然是在停止了。但如果不是這様，那末，當然又要向另外途徑蔓延的。我們要曉得·尋常淋巴管的終點，是和靜脈接近的，所以結核菌的侵襲，在這種時際，是很容易向靜脈血管系統蔓延的。結果當然和動脈也免不了發生關係的。這一種途徑，大慨因淋巴性結核陷於乾酪變性狀態下，由胸管的轉移，而侵襲到血液裏面，再由此而蔓延到全身的。假使血液中的結核菌太多了，那就會發生急性粟粒結核的；這種病在醫學界裏面，是談虎色變的，在數屋期裏面，差不多總免不了死亡的。但如果結核菌在血液裏面侵襲的數目是不很多的，並且病人身體有相當抵抗力的，他的結果，係在任何一器官裏面，發生局部結核性病變的。像腎臟副腎大腦脊髓副睪丸卵巢等諸器官，都有不少明顯的例證的，他的構成經過，大槪係因結核菌侵入血液系統，結果在本器官裏面發生一大結節，由此而慢慢的，發生身器官症象的。但究竟是從那個淋巴腺而侵襲血管的，最初的病灶究竟在什麽地方，這種種問題，就是在屍體解剖方面，有時還是解决不了的。</p>
<p>最後還有一間題，也應該連帶解决的。就是肺結核的構成，是不是可由管孔系統的途徑而進展，和腎臟結核一様的。這一種情形，也是可能的。我們要曉得，尋常在肺門方面的乾酪變性的淋巴腺，可傳染着其他接近的氣管枝，由此而逹到其他一切分枝的。他從此在氣管粘膜上，也同様的構成結核性乾酪變性，就時氣管枝附近的組織和小氣泡等各部分，也都現着浸潤的狀態。這様一來，在肺部裏面的病虫，也有大小不等的數種發現，甚至他的浸潤面積，可以到一肺全葉大小相等，並且個個病蟲，都現着乾酪變性軟化狀態的。這種肺結核症的結果，可以發生空洞，由此而轉成開放性肺結核症的。</p>

<h3>談夢</h3>
<p>— 於莵</p>
<p>人生如果有什麽呌做幸福，我想一定就是夢！在夢裏，人生一切渴求，都會使你滿足，不管它是驚或是喜的刺激，你總是有這麽要求的。</p>
<p>夢裏殺人或被人殺戮，這是常有的事，亦卽如人生在世，不能殺人，必爲人所殺一様。不過它表現得有點不同，就是，你所欲殺而無力殺的，會使你眞個殺了他。夢中也！就因有這神秘，乃使你得到滿足而歡呼了。</p>
<p>在實生活裏，常是不死不活，髣髴慢慢被人屠割一般痛苦；這是詛咒現實而沒有勇氣反抗的人所常感受的。而夢中却能給你勇氣，居然能表現與之爭衡。卽使卒因氣力不足，給他捉住，一刀兩叚，也樂得個痛快！</p>
<p>這些在人間得不到的幸福，夢，會給你完成的。</p>
<p>宗敎家常勸人信仰上帝說，誠心祈禱，便會獲到它的救挽而抵逹天堂。我以爲這大可不必；因爲我們的夢，實在常常接引我們到那裏去了！他們不是眩設一些什麽地獄恐嚇我們嗎？其實神話中的地獄，祇不過是先進的聰明祖先，迫於當時的淫威，說不出當時的老實話，故弄玄虚地玩的一種諷刺筆調。我們蚩愚的小民，不善理解，隨而幻起一種迷信的心理，是有的。</p>
<p>在夢裏，你會得到一切的解釋；在夢裏，你也會得到一切的解脫。那些望之不可卽的東西，在夢中都可以得之！</p>
<p>「浮生若夢，」旣然活著還是夢，我們更何妨眞個做夢去？</p>
<h3>杜威爾河畔（續）（完）</h3>
<p>— 老白</p>
<p>我底眼發暈了，痛苦佔有着陶醉。我感到無味，我感到悲我。忽然那地上的草和綺君底脚，都變成了許多萎黄的骷髏，那些骷髏都在向着遠處的墳墓中跑。恐怖與痛苦佔有着我，我不忍讓一個年靑的人也跟着那些骷髏跑向墳墓中去。我知道這祇有使他滅亡；不會使他新生的呵。於是我流着痛苦的涙，不禁把綺君呌住了；</p>
<p>「綺君，你不能滅亡！你還年靑丨丨你須要努力去做你底事業。····浪費靑春底路道祇能使你死亡；綺，你眞的願一直浪費到死麽？···綺！你應該走過一條你所應該走的路呵！」</p>
<p>「怎麽？······」綺君慌忙地走到我底面前，『白，你瘋了嗎？你爲甚麽要說些這様瘋狂的話呢？』</p>
<p>『我沒有瘋！······』我很快地站了起來，『綺，眞的！我非常可惜你，我覺得你這有用的靑春把牠浪費在享樂中是一件非常可惜的事呵！』</p>
<p>綺君沒有把什麽話語來回答我。他微笑着走到我底身邊，又把我挪到椰子樹下坐着了。</p>
<p>『你難道這一生就永不做事了嗎？·····』我苦悶地向綺君說。</p>
<p>『你呌我做什麽事呢？』</p>
<p>『我呌你不要浪費你底靑春。你應當去做一番事業；去做我們爭自由底偉大的事業呵！····綺，你懂得麽？</p>
<p>綺君沒有做聲，他把頭低下去了，像在想着一件甚麽事。</p>
<p>三月底風依舊是帶有點凉意。椰子樹被吹得呼呼作響。我們似乎陶醉在一個詩境里，然而我們並不需要這詩的情緒來哀。我底心里很難過，像在做着一個痛苦底夢。</p>
<p>『白，····』綺君忽然這様呌着我底名字，『你說得不錯；一個人沒有自由，沒有愛，是一件最痛苦事。』</p>
<p>『那麽你就應當努力呀。』</p>
<p>『我努力麽？···』綺君冷笑了一下，『我覺得我根本就無努力的可能，因爲我自己就沒有失去我底自由。</p>
<p>『綺君！·····』我又放大了聲音呌着他底名字，『你眞的就這様的麻醉下去麽？』</p>
<p>『麻醉？····』綺君自己這様細微的自語着。他用乎抓住了他的頭髮，頓時那光滑地生在他頭上的頭髮也被他抓亂了。於是他竟然哭了！他帶着憂鬰的音調說：</p>
<p>『白，······我·····我覺悟了！』</p>
<p>我仲出了我底乎，把綺君底乎握得更緊了。我竟快樂到流出了眼涙。一種光亮在綺君底眼中閃耀着，他悲愴的說：</p>
<p>『我這次在開羅便發現了許多失去了自由和失去了愛的人！·········這是一件眞事：埃及底人民一點自由也沒有，他們過的是被壓迫與被榨取的生活；雖然他們也曾作過幾次的反抗，但結果也不過徒然被殺害了幾個罷了。我這次來。也就是爲了不忍看那種不自由的生活而來的呵！』</p>
<p>『綺，·······』我用手拍着他底肩，『我以爲世界上不自由的恐怕不僅是埃及一個地方罷。』</p>
<p>『那當然，······，』綺君坦白地說，『不自由底人正多着呢。』</p>
<p>『在開羅還有甚麽古怪的事嗎？·····』我底話又扯得遠了。</p>
<p>『别的倒沒有，到現在我還記得很淸楚的，便是我在開羅所失去的一條小狗。·····』綺君又在開始說着他在埃及底故事：『那條狗眞好！他底名字呌做哥倫，他是狗中一條最聰明最伶俐的狗。每天我都要帶哥倫出去，我把牠帶到跳舞塲，把牠帶到電影院，我還把牠帶到有名的Ｐｙｔａｍｉｄ去玩，沒有一處我沒有把牠帶去的。牠享受無量的幸福。許多人都沒有哥倫底運命好，因爲在世界上還滿堆着連麵包也吃不着的被飢餓圍困着的人。但我的那條狗却不曾憂慮過麵包，·······我吃什麽，哥倫也吃什麽。</p>
<p>『哥倫很有勇氣！······記得有一天：當一個乞丐跑到我底寓所來的時候，他居然向着哥倫討乞，他向哥倫哀求的說：</p>
<p>『我們底狗大人！請你發一發慈悲吧！我實在是飢餓得不能忍耐下去了呵！你給一點牛奶，一點牛肉我吃罷！』</p>
<p>『可是我底哥倫却很巧妙地跑到那乞丐底面前狂吠起來。他還追了上去把那乞丐底衣服咬破了幾塊；那乞丐沒有反抗，他終於懦弱地走了！』綺君說到這裏似乎很感傷的様子，他帶着沉痛的音調說：</p>
<p>『唉，這是以往的事！······我覺得我的以往是罪惡的，是殘酷的！·······那不是人底生活，那簡直是在過着魔鬼底生活呵！』</p>
<p>『關於狗底故事就祇有這一點嗎·····』我問着綺君。</p>
<p>『不，·····』綺君悽然的說。『白，請恕我再不能說下去了呵！因爲我現在是不忍再提起以往的事情了呵！』</p>
<p>我沒有做聲．我看見綺君獨自地在流着眼涙．這河畔，充滿了靜穆的，嚴密的空氣。</p>
<p>三月底風，在吹着椰子樹。我們底身上被吹下了幾片圓的樹葉，我隨便拾起了一塊，呆呆地悵望着牠。</p>

<h3>「中國文學研究專號」</h3>
<p>— 問木齋</p>
<p>過去凡屬文學性質的雜誌，幾乎都曾出過中國文學的專號，但不過那麽一回事而已。嘗恩中國文學專號，是可出而又不可出的。蓋關於中國文學的專著，已經多到不易計數，何用再來搜羅零星，匯爲「專號」？然而正惟因爲這様的專號太多了，另一形式的中國文學專號，是可出且需要出的。夫出一個中國文學專號，非提倡過去中國文學而表彰之之意也，而是，至少須對於中國文學有一種特殊，新鮮問題的提供。這次「文學」所出，是合乎這一前提的。</p>
<p>專號内容，計論壇四篇，論文三十篇，書評三篇。首篇遠君的「中國文學研究者向那裏去」指出「向新的題材和向新的方法裏去求得一條新路出來」，由此而重新估定中國文學的價値，亦卽是改造中國文學史。鄭振鐸的「三十年來中國文學新資料的發現史略」對於新題材的發現，有槪括的叙述。此外又多研究中國語言文字聲韻樂律之作，如魏建功的「中國純文學的姿態與中國語言文字」，劉半農的「吕氏春秋古樂篇昔黄節解」，郭紹虞的「中國詩歌中的雙聲疊韻」，吳文祺的「論文字的繁簡」等篇，這是一般所忽視的。要完全符合遠君所指出，單單一期專號，且又在創始時，自然很難相責望的。</p>
<p>但有一點，卽兪平伯的「左傳遇」，祇是一種讀書雜記，顯明些說，是一種讀經雜記或讀史雜記，但非中國文學研究專作，放在這期專號裏面，似乎有些「不類」。因這與推翻傳統文學觀念的本旨是抵觸的。</p>
<h3>雜誌盛行與單行本衰落</h3>
<p>— 傳紅蓼</p>
<p>六月號的現代上，編者在文壇展望裏，曾提出這様一個重要的問題，那是：「一九三四年文藝雜誌底盛行，與單行本底衰落」。其論點是：「單行本售價太高，雜誌底售價較低，而質量方面，却又相等，所以在社會經濟低落之時，讀者購買力薄弱之日，這是一個險狀，而是整個文壇底問題。要補救這險狀，只有减低單行本底售價。」</p>
<p>這種細心的留神，的確値得欽佩，其理論也頗中肯；不過仔細研究，似乎這種見解却尙有未盡之處。這種畸形發展的現象，我以爲仍然是一些作家們本身底間題。</p>
<p>雜誌盛行與單行本衰落，當然民社會不景氣讀者在經濟上避重就輕爲一個原因，但雜誌和單行本底内容問題，却也是一個重要關鍵。讀者們在上過單行本内容空虚的大當之後，於是對於一般靠不大住的作家起了懷疑，而他們讀書慾尙未完全毁滅的時候；惟一地只有尋到雜誌身上去。在那裏，有着多量的作者及作品，他們可以：從甲作者身上失望的時候，再到乙作者身上去求償，單行本則不能如此便當了，於是單行本便日見衰落。</p>
<p>「爲什麽少見内容充實的單行本」？這問題的癥結是；一些作家們，爲了生活底體騐的缺乏，貧血症傳染到許多人底身上，實在寫不出怎様驚人的作品；但版稅又不能不抽，生活也不能不維持，甚或是愛人不能不交，跳舞不能不去，結果，只能把無聊的東西，濫竽充數，交給書店老板，出書了事。試問這種情勢之下，單行本應該不應該慢慢地沒落呢！</p>
<p>在五四剛始萌芽之時，一些讀者差不多都像瞎子般，只是跟在作者的後面亂撞。可是現在時代是進步了，讀者們也還略能辦别靑紅皂白；以前變的把戲，到現在已漸不哄動，而一些懸掛正牌的老角色，也漸漸失去其號召力了。但書店老板，或雜誌編輯，對於崇拜老角底心，却未曾變動；而讀者們却時刻在極端地盼望着新角產生。在這種矛盾之下，結果只剩老角底正牌儘管掛，一齣齣戲也儘管唱，而舞台門前，看客們却都裏足不前，慢慢地溜到「游藝樂園」或是「大世界」裏去了。這裏我們覺得「游藝樂園」「大世界」很像雜誌，而儘掛老角牌子的「舞台」却是單行本。</p>
<p>還有，還有····這裏不想多舉。</p>
<p>雜誌盛行與單行本衰落，不僅僅是價錢問題那様簡單，我以爲至低這是作者們本身底問題！誰保得住呢？雜誌底内容，倘使也趨於淺薄和空虚，像眼前單行本時，其衰落恐怕還更要利害呢！</p>
<p>這現象，依結論是：「一面是讀者們底進步，一面是作者們底退步，」這是整個的文壇問題，作者們本身底問題。我們要堵塞這種危險的傾向，這種頽廢的延展，先要檢查自己，愼重下筆，而更須要的是充實自己，然後才會有給進步的讀者們以滿意的作品！</p>
<p>雜誌盛行與單行本衰落，這是給寤寐着的作者們底一個當頭棒喝！</p>
<h3>火災（六）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>於是我們從一道較近的路走回去。在路上，忽然張君焦急地說：</p>
<p>「這風，使人怕。假使有了火災，那可不是玩的。現在潮水小，如果發生了火災，風又刮着，是沒有水可以解救的。」</p>
<p>這些話頗引起我的驚怪，「怎在這時候忽然提起這種話來？」我注視着我的友人的臉，他沈浸在幻想裏，似乎眞的火會燒起來般。我問：</p>
<p>「朋友，什麽事情使你這般煩惱呢？』</p>
<p>「逸生，你不知道，」他似乎帶點抖的語氣，「近來有幾處地方鬧着火災，據說是破產的商人的詭計。他們放起火來，希圖避去商業危機的責任。在他們將近或已經破產了的人，自然有利，而在我，火災一起，損失可不小啊！三個禮拜前，新加坡廣隆號聽說本埠已經陸續地保了火險，以爲機會來了，丨丨逸生，你是知道的，本埠從來沒生過了一次火災；並且我們這班老僑是只顧眼前，不顧未來的，這劣根性你總知道吧？丨丨所以，廣隆號一知道這個消息，立刻打電報呌我趕快也去保火險。我當然照着辦。不過手續很麻煩，要總局派來調查，調查好了，保險單又要由巴逹維亞（十一）總局發出，然後才轉棉蘭分局寄來．現在本號倒調查過了，保險單却還未來。你想，如果這幾天有火災，那豈不糟了嗎？』</p>
<p>『那不至於罷？』我安慰他道：『以前這裏都是「阿答厝」那種容易引火的樹葉，都不曾惹起一次火災；難道現在換了瓦屋，倒不安穩嗎？並且沒有這麽巧，便剛剛在這幾天發起亂子來！等過了幾天，保險單來了，豈不是什麽都不怕了麽？』</p>
<p>『然而，逸生，你在商界的日子是淺得幾乎等於零的，經騐太少哩！從前和現在不同；時機可不能讓人慢慢商量啊！』他堅决地說。在這少年人的臉上，浮起老年人的煩慮的神態。　　這一晚，這塲歡宴並不歡樂。外面風更大，主人是默默地少說話。香賓酒是開了，倒沒有像以前這些少年們過新年時的潑刺的縱飲。笑聲是有的，倒不十分熱閙。只有幾位哇哇（十二），這些終天沒有管事而專事遊散的閒人，倒十分起勁。他們盡力激起笑聲，勸大家飲酒。我因是客人的原故，倒被灌得有點朦朧；然而因爲心裏有點陰影存在的緣故，這種酒喝起來倒覺得有點苦悶。</p>
<p>（註十一）巴逹維亞在爪哇島，是荷屬東印度的首府，南洋荷殖民地的總督駐於此地。</p>
<p>（註十二）馬來語呌少爺做「哇哇」，後來華僑便把本地生的華男也呌做「哇哇」了。</p>

<h3>茶市的樂觀與其危機</h3>
<p>— 宜盦</p>
<p>這幾天，愛喝茶的朋友們，在案頭正擺着淸香的或芳烈的緑茶或者紅茶，在鑒色當新。各地的大量的生產品，又復湧到了上海漢口的重要巿塲，中外商人，都在談盤論價忙得十分起勁。内地農民，做好了第一批的春茶，預備着繼續趕製夏茶以便多獲若干的現金。甚至銀錢業都也爲茶巿的熱閙，跟着在忙押匯，兌現等的工作。</p>
<p>本年各業的不景氣，比過去更廣汎，深刻，和　重化了。海外的絲巿繼續報跌，新繭巿價低到不及二十塊大洋一擔，連桑葉的成本都够不上。現在正是靑黄不接的當兒，照例食糧的價格會繼續上漲，但反在天天的下趨。在减工中的紗廠，以爲受了美國旱荒的刺激，可以略有轉換，但消息傳來，還是預備繼續减工。甚至進出口的貿易數量，大小商店的營業狀况，都在縮减中，幾乎沒有一件能逃避掉在嚴重的世界經濟恐慌襲擊下的各帝國主義者正在積極地要轉嫁其恐慌於半殖民地的中國的現况下，而茶業却有其例外，這似乎是現代中國產業中的奇蹟了！</p>
<p>二十二年茶葉的出口總額比二十一年增加了八％（二十二年爲六九三·八一Ｏ擔二十一年爲六五三·八八八擔）今年過去的五個月中又比去年增加了三Ｏ％（據上海漢口兩處檢騐報告去年一至五月爲九七·同期已逹一三六·八六地公擔）雖然本年是因了四月間蘇俄輸出有五萬餘公擔的磚茶所致；但上海出口的紅緑茶也都略有增加，不能不令人抱相當的樂觀了。而海外的茶葉巿價，都較過去見高若干，至少也能屹立着不起若何的變動。因此，去年除祁門，寗州的紅茶以外，屯溪平水的緑茶，兩湖溫州的低莊紅茶，都嬴得不少的餘利。</p>
<p>今年遂安等各地的珍眉緑茶依向例以到滬最早，先行開盤，價格雖然甚優，但較去年亦不見若何下跌；而久已不惹世人注意的湖南湘潭，浙江温州及江西之河口紅茶，則各洋行爭先購辦，出價大都能得售客之滿意。一月以來，價格始終堅挺，祁門紅茶到上海以後頂價到逹二百十元，以本年之新頒巿秤與去年相較，售價高漲二Ｏ％。寗州紅茶今年以出貨甚佳，價亦較往年爲高。屯溪之珍眉，紹興之平水等路莊緑茶，開盤巿價，亦未較去年見跌。雖然這過去一個月間較爲樂觀的新茶巿面，未必能保證今後的一帆風順，可是就大體而言，低莊的紅茶需要，必較去年更爲積極，而其巿價自亦不致於怎様的下趨。最近花香（卽茶末茶片）的需要與巿價，亦破過去十餘年來的紀錄，所以祇要以後各種紅緑茶巿價不致十分的趨跌，則今年的茶巿，定可有相當的滿意，這是無疑的了。</p>
<p>昨今兩年爲什麽低莊的紅茶能够有如此的活躍呢？紅緑茶的巿面，爲什麽不致十分的變動而且反而有增漲的趨勢呢？最重要的原因，是印度錫蘭爪哇等幾國實行了生產限制的恊定。其次爲英美各國貶低貨幣，國内的生活費指數均見提高，蘇聯的第二次五年計劃實現以後增加爲多）其三，則爲向銷我國緑茶之非洲土人，其所受的世界經濟恐慌的影響，不如各資本主義國家之甚。</p>
<p>印度錫蘭爪哇等國家，向以出產紅茶著聞，近三五年來，鑒於國家外茶巿的低落，乃於去年起就各該國出口的數量中，同時減產一五％，總計减少數量逹一萬萬二千萬磅之巨。自去年實行以後，歐美的存底，顯見减少，而巿價也因而提高。同時因他們限制輸出數量和提高茶葉價格的結果，於是中國的低級和廉價的兩湖溫州及河口紅茶乃得而活躍了。又因了英美各國生活費指數的提高，非洲銷路不起變化，紅緑茶巿價也仍能繼續維持。同時爲磚茶原料之花香，因俄莊之需要而刺激其他各洋行的蒐求，價格也因而上漲了。</p>
<p>這様說來，中國的茶業能够獨走鴻運？眞的可以抱着樂觀了麽？輸出的數量，出售的巿價，能够長上進或永久維持下去麽？這恐怕誰都不能說半個是字的罷。悲觀。恐慌。以過去或未來的種種隱憂，在我們看來，祇要某一個極短的時期過去，就會立刻到臨。</p>
<p>不講别的，單從上面的生活產紅茶的幾個重要國家的生產限制恊定來說羅，他們的期限爲五年，去年限制的爲一五％，今年已减少二。五％，而且他們在國内以及在倫敦，正在想盡方法，謀茶業的發展和抵制。更厲害的是日本，他是中國緑茶的競爭國，他們把中國行銷蘇俄的惟一的緑茶主顧，已於最近數年被其掠奪殆盡，近且侵入非洲和東北四省了。本年日本的靜岡茶業組合，雇傭了中國茶師在開始試製各種適銷於東北的茶葉，三兩年後，也恐將爲他們所奪。所以英銷的大宗的高級祁門紅茶，本來已如日薄西山，無法復興，而僅靠他人所唾餘的一點低級紅茶，在不久的將來，祇須被人家略施小技，便會不打而倒的。銷往非洲的緑茶，如果一經日本茶的再三的活動，也怕就會受到極大的打擊，如果東北四省的内銷茶也同時受到了影響，則華茶外銷，僅靠俄國所獨占的紅緑磚茶，與一部分不甚重要的内銷茶而已。那還有什麽茶業可言呢！</p>
<p>中國的茶農當然是沒有組織的，尤其是各地的茶商，不但毫無遠見，而其惟一目的，祇在設法售得高的價格而向茶農買到低的貨色，祇要洋人要買，不管茶葉中含有什麽雜質他們都滿不在乎！這正如人家積極地建造高速騰空與耐久飛行的戰鬥飛機，我們還是在請張天師來念咒劃符去驅逐妖孽。結果必歸於失敗被征服，是無疑的事實。</p>
<p>現在不是在高唱着復興農村，統制棉業和絲業麽？不是爲了東北已失，而要去開發西北麽？古人說得好：「無遠慮，必有近憂。」「凡事預則立」。因爲棉花輸入的過多而提倡植棉，因絲繭的衰落而再圖救濟，這似乎是亡羊補牢的辦法，多少終已受了損失，或者甚至於是費力多而成功少的了。中國的茶業，似乎還不曾走到了絶境。願關心茶業者。趕快來加以，茶葉的需要較前增多。（其中尤以紅緑磚茶注意罷，否則眞是　臍莫及了啊！</p>
<h3>輸出茶的檢騐與貿易</h3>
<p>— 胡浩川</p>
<p>我國茶的國際貿易，可以分做兩個時期。，公然的攙假。外銷失了信用，數量自然也就有唐之末，迄于淸初，是陸運的塞外貿易。歐人東漸了後，蒙古及西藏内附密切，茶向歐美各洲，得著巿塲的新需要，這是水運的海外貿。</p>
<p>易</p>
<p>塞外貿易時代，曾有過半檢騐的政策。元朝設立有榷茶批騐所，重要的目的，原在緝私杜漏，增進官營的效力。同時對于茶的審查，如辨别種類，如鑑定眞僞，也有附帶的，注意。海外輸出的當初。茶是我國獨有的天驕子。我們是絶對自由的供給，需要者是一無揀選的接受。自從别的國家，也有了大量生產，作猛烈的對抗之後！黄金時代，漸漸灰了當日特獨的色彩。但是我們的茶，品質超越一切，盛况的持續，在理應該是可能的。五十年前，輸出逹到二百六十萬担。民國紀元的前六年，也還平均有一百五十萬担：就中一九一五（四年）年，且爲二百一十萬担。一九一八（七年）以後，差不多是一年不如一年了。</p>
<p>失敗的原因，要從茶的本身考查，實際上是有很多的缺點，由于人事的未盡：天惠的優美，也被了埋沒，弄得發揮不出。經濟上的不合理，經營的徒費，中介商的茶棧重重剥削榨取，如祁門紅茶，運到九江，成本已較爪哇茶到逹英國的價格爲高。栽培及製造上的技術，不能日新月異的進步。這些姑且不論。但就輸出品的不善方面，試說一二事實。茶是茶値物的芽葉製成的，不發酵的緑茶，本有天然的色彩，除少數特殊的情形之外，相習一例的著色。美國的銷路，就這様的送了日本。溫州一帶的茶，品質也還有相當的過得去，當地的茶商日形其不振了。</p>
<p>溫州爲了攙假，短了銷路，曾有甌江出口茶檢騐所的設立，所長黄文中任事很久，收了相當的效果。但這是地方的一種臨時組織，檢騐也太單純了。近來各地商品檢騐局設置之後，上海及漢口先後開始出口茶的檢騐，已經三週年了。當初，有極少數的無識商人從事反對，說是這未免病商。這雖過往的事，不必深論：但檢騐爲促貿易的一種政策，可見一般的人，未能明瞭。有些比較進步些的議論家，這様的說：茶業的復興，應該專走栽培及製造改良的路；檢騐是從茶的成品著手，捨本逐本，未免徒勞無益。這也是不知檢騐作用的說法。生產改進，固然重要；成品檢騐，也是促起生產改進的手段之一。原來檢騐的實施，至少可以得著下列的四種效果：丨</p>
<p>（甲）制定輸出茶類的標凖　茶類的運銷海外，一向是全憑商人自由的販賣。唯利是圖的商販，只求無理的减輕成本，不顧品色的向上。供應巿塲，漫無規律。檢騐實施，首先規定最低標凖茶様」，使生產及買賣各方，均有明確的依據。</p>
<p>（乙）禁止低劣茶類的輸出　够不上「最低標凖」，卽在檢騐下不能合格，禁止輸出。這種標凖，並不限于天然的品質。人工的方面，亦有較重要的九點：</p>
<p>一·粗放　製造不精，卽有這種情形，以形狀作標凖。</p>
<p>一·夾雜　採製過程中手續不愼，便免不了有這情形。</p>
<p>一·攙假　無識的生產者，偶有攙入陳茶或假茶的。</p>
<p>一·劣變　製造以及儲置包裝失愼，便致損壞天美。</p>
<p>一·著色　天然色彩，可由製造保持；不應乞　于顏料。</p>
<p>（丙）促進茶類生產的改善　檢騐標凖，逐年眞高。生產自不得不隨著適應，可以馴成改進的功效：丨丨</p>
<p>一·栽培的改善，以求品質的天然進步。</p>
<p>一·採摘的改善，以求原料的質地精純。</p>
<p>一·製造的改善，以求技術的竭盡能事。</p>
<p>（丁）發展茶類國際的貿易　檢騐實施，輸出品有了純正的保證。國際信用旣著，消費者習于供應品的日有進步，當然樂于飲用；商人也勇于推銷了。需求增進，前途自有無盡的展望。</p>
<p>去年溫州的茶，從檢騐上發現了攙假，上海檢騐局立卽咨知浙江省政府明令禁止，並派員實地宣傳危害的意義。那已經告了停頓的當地檢騐，本年又復重整了嚴陣的旗鼓。檢騐促進生產，這就得了一個明證。</p>
<p>著色的茶，美國旣禁止在先，近來非洲又有了限制。原因卽在所用的色料，質性往往失了純正，甚且像黄的含有銘酸鉛；緑的含有氧化銅。這又何怪遭了國外的不歡迎？立卽禁絶任何著色，自是應有的辦法。商人爲了習用已久；海外尙有相當的需要；丨丨雖然是有條件的限制，丨丨深以改變得太　，或致不合供應的情形爲慮。不過著色終被現有需要巿塲的淘汰，也是當前卽或實現的事實。假使我們不想中國茶仍有海外貿易的維持和發展在無盡的未來，儘可一切放任了去。現在檢騐著色的政策，採取漸進禁絶的主義。一方面暫准出口；一方面規定著色的程度，一年年的减低標凖，以　逹到天然色澤爲止。至于不純正的色料，絶對禁用；沒有代用品的，也另行創制了。這是較艱難的問題，不能不說是已上了解决的途徑。去年開始規定著色的標凖，就前年輸出的様品比較，在標凖上以及同標凖的爲數甚鉅。當時頗有些茶業家，認爲銷路定不免有短少的危險。實施以來，輸出數量，反有百分之八的增加。</p>
<p>總之，檢騐有利海外貿易。尤其檢騐是積極的改良政策；並非消極的限制主義，這已是明顯的事實了。</p>
<h3>日本茶業對華侵略之陰謀</h3>
<p>— 陸輝</p>
<p>我國對外貿易，人莫不知絲茶爲輸出大宗，但吾人試問目前中國絲茶業現象如何？則不待言而孰皆憂形於色，示其深刻之悲觀。考絲茶何以衰落一至於此，一般觀察、認爲世界經濟恐慌，購買力減少所致，但此爲一時之偶然現象，何足代表中國絲茶衰落之整個原因。</p>
<p>然則主因何在？一言以蔽之；曰「國人缺乏競爭精神耳」。不知競爭，遂忽於個業之團結，對外無實地考察，宣傳，等設施，消費國之需要狀况，無由得悉，以作轉移或改進其產業之張本。對内則不尙原料之改善，設備之更新，與夫製品之精廉，以爲競爭之工具，因循猶豫，坐使偉大產業之銷塲，任人剥奪。</p>
<p>中國絲茶競爭之對象，其惟日本，日本者，乃東亞一小島耳，以其距華僅隔一帶之水，自古聲息互通，文化·政治，向取法於中國，絲茶之道，亦受我國之薰陶，造就其風尙，惟在昔並無若何建樹，詎知精求仿模，銳意改進，百年如一日，竟已成就世界現代化之絲茶國矣！</p>
<p>國際生絲巿塲，固已整個爲日本佔居，抑亦非本文所擬討論姑置不贅。卽就茶業而言，日本積數百年之努力，拓有廣大茶園，栽培製造巍然更新。至於組織之完密，經營之周致，國際宣傳之活躍，其結果已將華茶美洲巿塲，侵奪殆盡，近年以產量過剩，乃轉其視綫而競爭中國重要舊主顧之蘇俄與非洲巿塲，三五年來，果已有驚人之成績，茲將五年來日本絲茶輸出數字列表如左，以供參考：（單位磅）</p>
<p>國　别　一九三三年　一九三二年　一九三一年　一九三Ｏ年　一九二九年</p>

<p>合　計　二九、一六三、二四二　二五、九七九　九四Ｏ　二四、三七二、一七二　二二、五四三　五五三　二二、八五三、一九四</p>
<p>上表所示，美國與坎拿大日茶輸入，常維持其巨數，可知獨霸基礎，早告築成，其輸往法國之茶，亦有由法轉口運銷非洲者，是以近年日本緑茶輸往俄非兩地，逐年增加，大有突飛猛晋之勢，中國緑茶僅恃之俄非巿塲，根本實已顯着動搖！</p>
<p>最使吾人詫異者，其爲近三年來日本緑茶反見輸入產茶鼻祖之中國，豈非怪事！查該項數量除供少數在華百僑消飲外，大都運銷東北，自僞滿於去年施行茶葉進口値百抽三Ｏ之稅則後，日茶則於所謂特惠稅則下儘量運銷，以是國茶内銷之東北巿塲，亦起嚴重之變化矣！</p>
<p>最近日本認爲新販路之東北，依然仍喜飲用華茶，品質不合需要，開拓上發生碍難，一方產額又年年遞增，以致茶價慘跌，因此日本茶業中心之靜岡茶商咸集議對策，結果已得有根本改善之方針。所謂根本改善之方針者，卽由中國招聘製茶技師數人，指導仿製華茶，實行廉價傾銷，與華茶相對抗。此項計劃，現已實行，聞已從福州請去吳依瑞吳壽忠父子二人，及安徽歙縣之方念祖一人，凖備仿製華式綠茶，推銷東北各省，其處心積慮，殊有剥奪我國内銷及外銷巿塲之雄圖，吾全國茶業界其猛省也未？</p>
<p>本埠國際貿易局鑒於華茶殆勢之嚴重，爲求對策以資挽救計，近曾召集全滬茶商討論議有兩步驟：「第一步辦法，從事調查該案之眞相；第二步作國際上廣上宣傳，使消費者免受胃牌華茶之損失」云云，按上述辦法固爲應急之必需措施，特其非根本之對策耳！</p>
<p>際此時會，實爲華茶地位千鈞一髮之生死關頭，局部治療豈得奏效，吾全國茶業界應知情勢嚴重，亟宣發大覺心，起競爭精神召集有規模之組織，對内謀所宜改進栽培製造之方法；對外籌何以宣傳推銷之計劃，羣策羣力，與日爭不二立，一心一德，從奮鬥中謀出路，華茶基礎，庶有維持之望焉！</p>
<h3>談談印度茶業</h3>
<p>— 和鈞</p>
<p>印度是英國的屬地，英國是紅茶進口最多的國家，距今九十六年前，英國的茶葉巿塲，完全爲我國所獨攪，英人認爲國家漏巵不容忽視，乃在印度努力獎勵茶樹之種植，其目的在奪華茶之地位而代之。因爲有嚴密的組織，和科學的研究，故不及百年，其製茶品質之色深味厚，平均生產量之急劇增加，（每英畝年產六ＯＯ磅以上）已非華茶所能望其項背。現在輸出總數年逹三萬八千餘萬磅，約佔全世界輸出總數的五分之一，比同時期華茶總輸出超過五倍以上。卽批發或零售巿價，也比華茶高出數倍以上。</p>
<p>印度的茶葉產量雖豐，但印度土人不善飲茶，產額的七分之六均銷運海外，直　運至倫敦或美澳等處兜售。資本短絀的茶廠，便就近在加爾各答茶葉拍賣塲中呌賣。加爾各答爲北印度海口，茶葉拍賣每星期二舉行一次，七月至十二月茶巿最盛，代表賣方呌賣者爲賣茶經紀人，ＳｅｌｌｉｎｇＢｒｏｋｅｒ這賣茶經紀人的性質，合我國上海的茶棧有些彷彿，除了代賣客人的茶葉外，有時還貸欵與茶廠，作經濟上的援助。但是印度的賣茶經紀人其唯一酬勞爲百分之一的佣金，此外並無其他不正當的小費。因有指定的拍賣大廳，及指定的水陸運輸堆棧，呌賣及過磅時，萬目睽睽，經手人絶對不能作弊，賣了之後的付欵手續，及日期，皆有規定，賣買的客人，就是鄕下土老兒，或嫡親大外行，亦很難有額外吃虧的事情發生。茶葉出口人，則須担負檢騐費，扞様費及印刷費等，每箱約三安娜，棧租每九十磅取費三安娜六小派士，每逾一星期取費九小派士，經紀人酬勞百分之一，政府出口稅每百磅取費六安娜，出口義務捐每百磅一羅比八安娜，專爲擴充海外巿塲宣傳之用。海洋水脚運至倫敦者，每五十立方呎取費二磅六先令，至紐約則需五十五先令左右。</p>
<p>印度的茶葉所以能有現在之發逹，最要緊的就是有整個的有計劃的組織。印茶聯合會。ＩｏｄｉａｎＴｅａＡｓｓｏｃｉａｔｉｏｎ爲全印度植茶者之大團結，成立於一八八一年，總會在倫敦及加爾各答，分會則遍設於全印產茶區域，該會茶使命除聯合同業外，對内有科學研究部，ＴｈｅＳｐｉｅｎｔｆｉｃｄｅｐａｒｔｍｅｎｔ及茶葉試騐塲，ＴｅａＥｘｃｅｒｍｅｎｔａｌＳｔａｔｉｏｎ研究最經濟生茶產方法，改良栽培與製茶品質等基本工作，每年經常費約二十萬羅比。對外則有宣傳局ＰｒｏｐａｇａｏｄａＣｏｗｐａｉｎ專作印茶向外發展的宣傳，近年來大規模茶在美國烹飪學校中敎授印茶的飲用方法，并在報章雜誌及播音台中盡量的灌輸關於印茶的常識。二十五年前在倫敦更有反華茶貿易宜傳會，ＡｎｔｊＣｈｉｎａＴｒｄｅＣｏｍｐａｉｎ專做排斥華茶的工作。還有茶稅委員會ＴｈｅＴｅａＣｅｓｓＣｏｍｍｔｔｅｅ成立於一九Ｏ三年，共有委員二十人，代表茶廠，茶商，及有關係各方，支配及决定政府代徵茶稅之用途，專就此項政府代徵之茶稅而言，每年已有一百二十萬羅比以上，專做推廣印茶巿塲之用，試想每年有此鉅欵，繼續不絶的向外宣傳發展，印度茶葉那得不蒸蒸日上呢，美國是素嗜緑茶的，但自歐戰後，受了印茶廣大宣傳的影響，現在已漸漸改嗜印錫紅茶了，中日兩國的輸美茶葉數量，便逐年减落，日本緑茶雖然在美國吃了印度茶的虧，却會掉轉頭來向我中國壓迫，奪我俄國及非洲茶的塲，可憐呀！魚吃蝦，蝦吃沙，最後的損失，仍是我國這沒有組織的茶業界哩。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>如果以外觀而論，這一班樂隊實在可以算得是很美麗的了！不但這些樂工的服色那様的鮮艷，就是在這些樂器上，連那個大架子一起在内，也各有幾條光澤鮮明的黄色的綵鬚繫着，飄飄揚揚地好不奪目。</p>
<p>無論這一班樂隊的技藝是好是歹，總之，他們的差使確是很苦的。因爲只要太后高興的話，隨時隨地都要敎他們立卽演奏的。從北京到奉天去的路上，每逢火車停一次，他們就要齊齊整整地爬下車來，站在太后那一輛車子的窗外，照例吹打一陣。我記得有好幾次在太后的寢宫裏，還有好幾次在園裏的戲廳上，太后自己　着眼，很舒服地靠在龍椅上，而敎這一班樂隊不停的在旁邊演奏，常逹數小時之久；伊的神氣眞像睡着的一様···，但是倘若這一班樂隊在奉伊的命令以前，擅自將樂聲停止，伊就會立刻驚覺過來，責問他們何得偷懶。這些樂工當然是害怕極了，因爲只要伊把頭輕輕點一點，他們的腦袋就會馬上弔下來了！</p>
<p>（八）御衣庫</p>
<p>在這一列御用火車之中，還有一輛車是專載太后所用的衣服的。它的偉大和富麗，幾使人目爲之眩，神爲之奪；除却你能看見的一片彩雲似的錦繡之外，你就不用想細細鑑别它們。因爲它們委員實是太多了，太美麗了，它們的數量簡直是數不淸的！但是這一輛車上所有的，還祇是宫中御衣庫裏所藏的三四十分之一而已。（五四）</p>
<h3>搶親</h3>
<p>— 子云</p>
<p>作者對門一個石庫門裏的三層擱上，住着夫婦倆和一個妹子。妹子的名字，呌做彩弟。這一家三口，是都在附近一家烟公司裏作工的。彩弟已是二十一歲，未婚夫屢次想迎娶，爲了無力交納茶禮，而把婚事捺下了。因爲彩弟的未婚夫，也是一個工人，而彩弟的哥哥，堅執着非送過一百二十塊錢禮來，寗願把妹子養到老。而實際上呢，彩弟工作之所得，維持自身的衣食住，是綽有餘裕的。</p>
<p>昨天，黄昏時份，彩弟提着水壺出去泡水，給預伏在弄口的四個大漢，拉拉扯扯趕出去時，早已去得無影無踪了。</p>
<p>過了三個鐘頭光景，一個也是穿藍布褂袴的人，上彩弟的哥哥家，報告他彩弟是給未婚夫搶去拜花燭的。而且送來十六塊錢，算是六禮，以便將來雙方都可走動。</p>
<p>彩弟的哥哥，登時火氣直冒，要請白相人來評理，經那送錢來的，解勸了一番，又加了四元禮，凑足了二十元，才算和平結束。到了明天一早，彩弟由丈夫陪着來回門了，雙方倒都是客氣得很，似乎沒曾有昨晚搶親的那一回子事。</p>
<p>搶親，雖然似乎太野蠻，但我倒以爲這是頗合經濟的。</p>
<h3>狗的纞愛</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>鄕村中是沒有警察的，爲了防止宵小的光顧，所以差不多各家都蓄養着一條狗。據隣家的王老爸告訴我說：「狗還比人靠得住些，因爲它不論在風雨雪夜，總是忠於職守；而且任你怎様困苦潦倒，它也不會託故告退。」經了王老爸多次的慫恿，我終於在前年的年底，也養了一條黄色的母狗。至於這條狗剛到我的家中，還是乳臭未乾。一年的光陰過去，已經出落得腿粗　肥，毛色潤澤。在燃着「靑春之火」的狗少年目光裏，也許是一位很時髦摩登的狗姑娘吧！因此我的宅前，常常圍繞着十幾條黄的，黑的，白的，花的，大雄狗，吠着咬着，幹那吃醋爭風的玩意兒。</p>
<p>我們的狗姑娘，也禁不住雄性的誘惑　，全不憑「父母之命媒妁之言」，竟和一條同毛色的雄狗，發生一度戀愛，更進而實行同居。那雄狗不知那裏來的，趕也趕不掉，和我們的狗姑娘同起，同臥，同食。同玩，旁的雄狗瞧見了，自知失敗，各各夾尾低頭而逃。這様的過了幾天，那雄狗的主人尋來了，呌它它不瞅，曳它它不走，終於給它的主人硬拖了去。那知不到一點鐘，這黄色的雄狗又跑來了，和狗姑娘又厮守在一起。主人又找到了，見它一逃再逃，便用了一根繩子縛了它，曳它回去。一路上那狗兒似泣似訴的呌號着，而我們的狗姑娘，也垂頭喪氣的伏在地上，眼睜睜望着它心愛的纞人，給人刧去。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十回　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　　彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城</p>
<p>他二人如此說着，可是這位實芳營長，更是見機在先，已經站在一堵倒坍的矮墻上，向各方招手。他手下的弟兄們，已經四處找尋老百姓，一齊找到這地方來。寳芳喊道：老百姓，你們聽着敵人的飛機已經來了，從此以後，恐怕天天要來。我們當軍人的把這事看得稀鬆，那很算不了什麽。可是你們受不住這驚嚇，飛機一來，你們又跑又呌，這很可以擾亂軍心，你們雖是好百姓，到了那個時候，我是不會依你們的，誤了我的軍務，我就要用軍法來辦人的。現在和你們老百姓商量好。你們若是想太平趁了今天時候還不大晚，收拾東西，趕快搬走。你們能搬什麽，就儘量的搬什麽，我决不能來攔住你。若是不走的話，我很歡迎，帮着我這一營人，替中華民國來守這一塊土。到了那個時候，你們可就得受着我的指揮。也並不要你們打仗不過是請你們帮着挖挖地洞，送送飯。可是在軍令之下，我不能和你們客氣的，你們若是違了我的軍令，輕是打軍棍，重是槍斃。你們願意同那條路上走，現在就可以想一想。寳芳說完了這話，以爲這些老百姓，不能有什麽話說，一定是各自回家，收拾行李東西去。不想老百姓裏面，齊齊的有二三十個人舉起粗黑的手臂來，呌着道：我們願意帮營長打小鬼。寳芳道，你們决定了嗎？那些人都呌着我們决定了。寳芳站定了一看，大槪不曾舉起手來的，約莫還有三五十人。（四Ｏ五）</p>
<h3>海上兩公展</h3>
<p>— 長風</p>
<p>上海名人界中，有二人同名公展，一爲潘姓，乃巿黨部常務委員，現在上海巿敎育局局長，辦事精幹，又擅口才，能文章，書法挺秀，脫胎於蘇。近年剏辦晨報新夜報兒童晨報，參加團體工作，熱忱從事，以故自朝至暮，無片刻之暇。一爲謝姓，乃書畫家。尤善繪菊，藝術超逸，求者盈門，終日揮灑不倦，二公之名，常見報章，又屬知交，人多誤會此公展卽那公展也。潘君之夫人唐冠玉女士，亦以晝著稱，二公皆余所素稔，親友中常凂余代求潘君之畫者，用特表而出之，亦屬名人之佳話云。</p>
<h3>被殺頭的字</h3>
<p>— 遺</p>
<p>英文有所謂被殺頭的字者，乃一種文字遊戲也。英文名曰：ＢｅｈｅａｅａｄｅｄＷｏｒｄｓ，其法乃撰四五字母聯綴之字，割去其首，字母，成另一有意義之字，再割去其首一字母，則又成另一有意義之字，如：Ｓｐｅａ；長矛也：割去其首一字，則成Ｐｅａｒ，梨也；再割去其首一字母，則成Ｅａｒ，耳是也。至中國文字，本非由字母聯綴而成者，但亦有可以一字去其首而成另一有意義之字者，惟難能一再去其首耳。茲姑舉數例於后，或亦得謂爲被殺頭的字乎？</p>
<p>全，完全也；去其首則成王，姓也，又王天下者也。天，氣之淸而上升者也；去其首則成大，小之對也。安，安寗也，去其首則成女，男之對也；義，事之宜也；去其首則成我，自謂也。署，衙門也；去其首則成者，語助詞也</p>

<h3>畫眉璅話（上）</h3>
<p>— 金諤儒</p>
<p>鳥之好鳴者，類不勝舉，善鬥者已少，如能鳴與善鬥二兼者，除劃眉外，可謂絶無而僅有。畫眉產四川，以其眉如畫，故名。色以黄者居多，間有純白，其性好鬥善鳴，作聲巧如百舌，令人怡情養性。時當夏令，而其爭鬥之烈，亦不亞于黄頭鵪鶉也。茲將畫眉之選擇法，蓄養法等，略加論列，以供同好者之研究。</p>
<p>（甲）選擇法</p>
<p>一，頭之研究：頭須方大，形似削竹者，好鬥，深長而小方者，名委角，善鳴，其餘如蟹殻，道冠·甲魚·及圓頭者·常品也：至如橄欖頭。橘房頭·水蛇頭·最爲下品。又頸毛·素毛·其黑紋宜淡，濃則起落重，頂上起黑路者，起落亦重：起紅光者·其性急。腦骨以高爲貴。</p>
<p>二·眼之研究：眼色以鷄黄起沙眼·金沙　白眼·及大緑·小緑·碧緑·豆緑·等眼爲貴，式如長腰，三角，與喬麥等眼·亦佳，又有長如馬眼者，乃希有之上相也。荡眼爲下乘。眼搭之研究：眼搭如鐵色與重色爲上，淡靑次之，粉搭爲下。搭皮：以色如石靑，緑豆爲上，月白色，次之。眉之研究：眉長如一綫長紋·或短似筍椿者，皆妙品也；闊眉次之，曲眉爲下，若垂珠鹿角等眉皆善鳴不善鬥者也。眉搭：眉有黑痣者·曰搭，以雙搭爲貴，單搭性必不馴。</p>
<p>三·鼻之研究：欲識鳥之雌雄，須辨其鼻孔之通與不通，通爲雄，不通爲雌。</p>
<p>四·嘴之研究；嘴如竹根而起三稜，或尖矗如釘者，爲貴；若如撟·如梁·或彎·或曲者，下賤之相也。嘴色：畫眉之嘴，爲爭鬥之利器，不特辨其形，亦須辨其色，色如牛角，如黄蠟李·皆上將也。</p>
<p>五·下　之研究：下　以飽滿爲上，空虚爲下。</p>
<p>六·頸之研究：頸不宜長，長如鶴頸，鬥時少力；亦不宜短，短必仰頭；如其短而粗者·是名虎頸，决猛將也。</p>
<p>七·胸之研究：胸以闊大爲上，狹小爲下，狹小爲單胸，闊大而平爲雙胸；其不善鳴者·必鷄胸也。</p>
<p>八·背之研究：背以圓渾爲難得，其名曰虎形，扁而闊者，通品也。</p>
<p>九·翅之研究：翅以圓爲小，薄如金錢者·尤佳，是名蟬翅；有交翅如雀翅者，决下品也。</p>
<p>十·肘之研究：論其肘有短·有長·有圓·有扁·扁而短者·爲上；若圓而長，毛片復極厚者·不佳。</p>
<p>十一·眉之研究：論畫眉一身之高下，先在乎眉，眉以闊爲主，狹眉則旣不善鳴，又不好鬥者也。</p>
<p>十二·掌之研究：掌以筋骨大·皮肉厚·爲主；若薄而小者·凡鳥也。</p>
<p>十三·脚之研究：脚如牛筋，其色或黄·或白·其脚縫中有絲絲如血者·爲上；如乾老之籐條者·亦佳：若如麻栗·醋　·松皮·烏木·紫竹·等色，則斷然下駟也。</p>

<h3>自殺精神</h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>自殺是一件最不名譽的事。人到自殺，其無聊也就無以復加。人是應該鬭爭的；人根本是個鬭爭的動物。尤其在這社會中，人與入的鬭爭（大規模的整個人羣的鬭爭）十分激烈緊張的時代，人不鬭爭，就根本無法以自存，而且也根本說不到做人。然而自殺却也有一點可取之處，就是那自殺時的一刹那的勇氣。就是說，那不顧一切的勇氣。整個自殺是完全沒有意義的，而這自殺時一刹那的不顧一切的勇氣，是可以應用到别方面來的。</p>
<p>鬭爭，是困難的事，然而你假使是這麽一想：我譬如自殺，生命置之度外，這様你的鬭爭勇氣便來了。這是自殺時一刹那的不顧一切的勇氣，移用到别處來的一個好例。推而廣之，凡遇一切困難，你都以自殺的精神去幹，我想沒有幹不好的。中國人太平庸了，太安分守己了。這平庸，這安分守己，害了我們的一生。我想假使人人都能不平庸，都不安分守己，倒還可以幹一些事體出來。我們的所以太平庸，太安分守己，就是因爲太欠缺自殺的精神。自殺是有的，然而只限於吃安眠藥水，更進步點，則是跳黄浦江。像日本那様的切腹而死，墮厓而死，以及被火車軋死，在我國是不多見的。這就是中國人太平庸安分守己的明證，連死也要十分安全，十分平庸與安分守己。我們要强國，我們就要提倡不平庸不安分守己的精神。就是說，我們要提倡積極的自殺精神丨丨反抗精神。假使人人都能提出積極的自殺精神，反抗精神，我想中國現狀，至少要比現在好些。</p>
<p>自殺精神，就是要把自己的生命忘掉，只當自己已經死，或是只當自己正要去尋死。把這様的精神，去幹社會的事業，或是自己的事業，我想結果沒有不成功的。就是不完全成功，相當成績，是一定會有的。</p>

<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>是暮春了，哦，暮春與初夏的天氣在大體上雖沒有極特異的感覺，然而，在田野間多少是有點差異的。不，不能這麽說，牠不單在田野，在都會裏也有着同様的表現的。不是麽？都會裏的仕女們像行屍般的在穿了極輕薄的衣服滿街上走，那死进着汗滴的勞力者在裸赤着肢體和生命掙扎啊！</p>
<p>一陣溫和的風帶來了無數的綿綿地飛雨，像棉花是的，洒着，洒着，多麽的輕柔啊！白絨一様，一點，兩點，······逐漸的，連繫着，凝結着。當某一陣輕微的風，或是由人的衣角下行走的動蕩所进發出來的風，波送到牠的本體時，那，該多麽可憐啊！牠們在隨同着飄揚，滾蕩，以至於崩潰了。</p>
<p>不自覺的，看到了那飄飛的楊花，就連帶的要想起了女人。眞的，記得在從前，不，卽使現在，也還是這様的，當一個女人不守婦道的時候，所謂「婦道」，不用說，是專對某一個人的忠誠</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，必須的，要加以一種罪名的，於是，朝秦暮楚」「水性楊花」這一類的話，就會很輕巧的　到了某一個人的頭上，彷彿這些話很足以表示她們的人格。</p>
<p>在這裏，姑不問這舉動是否正確，也不必問是否適應於一般的不同的事實，在這社會爲男性中心化的現在，在這一切的潛勢不能消滅的現在，寄生的女人，她之被輕視，嘲笑，甚至漫駡的事實，是無法避免的。</p>
<p>爲什麽要用這「楊花」來比喻女性呢？哦丨</p>
<p>丨楊花，是輕柔的，浮蕩的，任何様的微力都能够把牠吹動的，這，或許也就是說她的輕柔，浮蕩，是與楊花一様吧？我想。</p>
<p>月日在一年一年地進展着，楊花也照舊在一度一度地飛飄着，當這不景氣的怒潮風捲了世界的現代，不管那所謂不守婦道的女人是怎様的被板着鐵面孔的禮敎者目爲不節，目爲敗類，但，在這怒潮中，又有什麽方法能使她們避開這資本社會的旋渦呢？</p>
<p>一陣溫和的風帶來了無數的綿綿地飛雨，像棉花是的，洒着，洒着。</p>
<h3>海戀漏</h3>
<p>— 白榕</p>
<p>站在海濱，看一望無際的夢様的波濤，傾聽着晴空中的繁星的絮語，和春樹間微颸聲籟，年輕的心底便湧起海様的戀情。是含着白銀色的誠懇，朱紅色的期望，淡紫色的憂鬰，碧緑色的溫柔的戀，沒人知道的戀，沉埋在海底的寂寞而凄淸的戀。</p>
<p>如夢的過去啊！沒痕跡的人生啊！</p>
<p>在海的盡端，鱗鱗的細雲散佈着溫柔的地方，藏着受我私自祝福的人，她，帶着我們一大串過去的光彩的日子，靜靜地住在那裏。可是她是寂寞的，像一株幽蘭那様。用她迷茫的眼珠去望那海，望那海上玫瑰色的文陽與晚霞，沙鷗與征帆，望一些海這邊的消息。</p>
<p>過去的日子像夾在古老書籍裏的落花，在整理的時候也許流出溫馨芳艷，可是一想到消逝了的生活的面影，便不由你不感到一層午夜燈牠夢回的淡淡的悲哀。</p>
<p>在某一個細雨霏微的上午，兩個小小的生命别開了，像兩片辭枝的金黄木葉被風吹散一様。充滿了别緒，我獨自衝到這世界的海洋裏去。忘記了港口，也忘記了暗礁，歲月在我身邊雲片似地流逝過去，此後當海風在我耳邊呼嘯着的時候，當蟋蟀的怨語打擊着我旅邸的秋窗的時候，當夜闌人散月淸如水的時候，過去便帶着憂鬰的面容來拜訪我。他使我每夜有個珍奇的紫色的夢境，和幾點凄淸的涙珠。</p>
<p>現在我是處在海濱，前面是萬里的波濤，點綴着星星的漁火，後面却是包羅千萬人的淫婦様的大都巿。噴着光與熱的烈火，向蒼空吐露地怨毒的腥紅的舌光。我是沒有笑，讓一兩絲沉默逗遛在我的臉上，暗想着人生的恩怨與悲歡。</p>
<p>而無窮涯的大海却在我面前匀整地呼吸着，奏着陰影中的諧樂。像是鐃鈸，像是落葉，像是惡獸的呼嘷，在丁香色的紫色天宇下面不作起伏。海的怒吼與低語，夢境的迷茫，心的澄凈，和出現於周圍的暮色的莊嚴，在這裏織成一幅最妖艷最神奇的繪畫。不，這不僅是圖畫，這是宇宙間最淸醇最柔美的天籟，譜出來的無言的遼遠的詩歌。</p>
<p>我是不能把過去的日子忘却了的。啊海！飄着微樂激着細浪的海！别忘了把我的戀情像輕帆搖地載到那一邊去吧！</p>
<p>我是會在那邊覓到已消逝了的戀情的。</p>
<h3>當舗</h3>
<p>— 流風</p>
<p>當舗，在這上海灘頭就有如大觀園裏的樓閣那麽多的隨處皆有，甚至像吳淞路那様的整條街全是當舗；而住在上海的人，對於進當舗這一回事，也習以爲常似的半點也不覺得稀奇，當然更無所謂什麽恥辱了。可是，在我的故鄕！廣東汕頭！情形就截然不同，一般平常的人家，就是到了困難的時候，也寗可用别的方法去補救，而不願意走入當舗去。因爲進當舗這一回事，在一般人的心眼中，簡直是一個大的恥辱；而當舖的生意，也祇能從那些破落户的人家身上打算盤。因此，我在故鄕住了十七個年頭，不但是沒有進過當舗，就連當舗裏面的情形！如當時的手續等！，也全然不曉得。一直到了離開故鄕，漂流到上海來後，才漸漸地在生活的鞭策下，懂得了這一當舗的路道。</p>
<p>但是，當我第一次送東西進當舗去的時候，我是那麽的感到胆怯而羞恥，我望見那一個大而黑的當字，就好像一個大的黑臉在向着我冷笑，彷彿是說：「嘿！現在你該懂得當舖的路道了，你這破落户的人家」！眞是令人望而生畏的不敢進去。可是，被生活逼迫得再沒有其他的法子想的時候，也只好硬着頭皮衝進這當舖的大門。</p>
<p>在這短短的一年中間，把我所有的比較値錢的錶，皮袍，大衣，西裝這些東西，全進了當舖，使我成然成爲一個熟於此的人物。我對於進當舖這一回事，已再也不會感到胆怯，羞恥；而和上海人一様的習以爲常半點也不覺得希奇。</p>
<p>可是今天早晨在斷炊的情形下，我帶着一條碩果僅存的洋裝褲子進當舗裏去的時候：走完了一條北四川路和吳淞路，進過這兩條路所有的當舗，不但換不到二隻角子的代價，反而嗜到我有生以來所未曾嗜過的，那些當舗裏的人那種令人難堪的滋味；於是，那破落户的恥辱，和窮途末路的悲哀，又重新湧上我的心頭，我欲哭無涙，我終於滲透了上海灘頭的當舗之所以隨處皆有而且多的原因，我更深深地感到這些壓榨窮人的當舖，將必然地隨着社會經濟組織的變動，在時代的車輪底下給輾得粉碎。</p>

<h3>靑天霹靂</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在今日畸形的社會裏，處處可以看到不平等的事實，無論銀行，大公司，工廠，甚致於小店，做銀行的行長，公司經理，小店的老板，他們因爲要壓迫小職員小夥計，不得不採用一種政策。對於上級職員或者有裙帶關係的，待遇總格外優厚寛鬆，反之對於小職員小夥計便種種的壓迫，所謂「賺錢不吃力，吃力不賺錢」。你雖然平日辦事很勤懇，極能耐苦，若非脚膀大，做一世總是一個小職員，小夥計。</p>
<p>敝友金君服務於本埠某公司已有十餘年，爲人誠實，辦事勤勞，該公司營業亦很發逹，進公司時每月薪金十元，至於雖逐年增加到二十元，但是有許多較他後來的早已升到主任，科長，薪俸每月五六十元了。在旁人看來，雖心有不平，而敝友總怪自己沒有好親戚，責自己或者平日辦事有缺點，所以仍是任勞任怨，安心的服務，不料靑天霹靂，公司方面藉故近年來受不景氣的影響，爲節省開銷起見，實行革人，而敝友因脚膀小又在被革之列。想他有六十多歲的白髮老母，以及妻子小兒等一家數口，不失業尙能在鄕間勉强糊口，非失業以後要感到極大的恐慌，况且在人浮於事的今日何處可以謀事。因此敝友日夜焦急自殺之心油然而生，否則難免坐而待斃，徬徨歧途，實無辦法。我看了他　　情形，心中甚爲感慨：爲什麽誠實耐　的人有這様遭遇？每日花天酒地反能安坐，取得高的薪金，仁慈的先生請你不惜金玉的餘地，在報端解答。敬請文安　　夏思鑫敬上</p>
<p>答：你所說的那種「壓迫小職員」，做事要靠勢力等等正是中國落後的象徵。在社會主義國家裏，不用說了，就是先進資本主義國家，不論在工業上或商業上，辦事人員的賞罰，也都以「效率」「成績」做標凖，絶不講什麽情面勢力。其原因就是資本主義發逹之後，工商業都要合理化，要講求科學管理法，這種腐化現象自然不能存在了。中國則不然，各業都很落後，工作技能不必講究，失業人數又衆多，你不嚴氣老板的待遇，你可走路，自有旁人來做，另一方面</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，傳統的拉攏親友習慣又深中了人心，因此，你所說的情形是很普遍的事。但是看情面，講勢力，究有相當限度，從前我有一位同學，想考某著名大學，自料考不取，恰巧那學校裏管理考生分數的負責人之一是他的至親，於是他便央求這位親戚，請他想法子。誰知他的親戚竟對他說：「包你取我不能說，假如你考的極壞我絲毫法子想不出的；但如最低的錄取分數有許多人，又不能全取，假如你也是其中的一個那我就可儘先取你」。你一段話很可給我們一個敎訓。你那位朋友雖然很誠實，忠於職務，但旁的與他同等級的同事恐也不見得比他壞，就是壞也壞不了多少，所以公司裏裁人就可拿有無關係勢力做標凖了。假如他的同等級的同事雖有極大勢力但做事極壞，那老板也是不會開除貴友而留那同事的。至於優待上級職員，或者說，待遇的不一律，此乃這個不平等社會裏的正常狀態，毫不足奇，而且，服務又分負責或計劃與事務或技術兩種，勞力也是商品的一種，其酬報或價値當然也有高低之别了。</p>
<p>上下級職員的不平等和待遇的懸殊等，這要在平等的社會裏纔能剷除，至於我們要求職業的鞏固，那除了社會的原因如巿面不景氣而外，假如你工作認眞，工作技能較高，自然被裁的機會要少些。</p>
<p>在學校招生考試上，如果錄取的額子很少，當然錄取的希望很少，你的成績很好，錄取的希望也很大。同様，公司裏要裁很多人（這是社會的原因，要用社會的力量克服的。）被裁的機會很大，你的辦事成績很好，被裁的可能自然也較小了。編者</p>

<h3>長安印象記（三）</h3>
<p>— 雲山</p>
<p>（四）「甜水」，和西安的「南京路」</p>
<p>數十萬人口的長安城，竟沒有一處供給居民淸潔飲料的較好設備。無論機關，學校，旅舍，住宅，人們的飲料，大都取之於自　的私家井水。味澀質濁，「久而不聞其臭」！所說西門大井的水是「甜水」比别的井水不同。但取運不便，賣價又高，當然大多數的巿民是無分享用的。</p>
<p>我看見一家水鋪門口，掛牌「出售西門大井甜水」。但門庭冷落，不見顧主。我自己吃沒吃，過西門大井的甜水不知道！只曉得從熱水瓶裏倒出來的白開水，入杯一二分鐘後，便有若干沉澱物，喝在口裏，覺到一陣難聞的土腥氣。　　陜西省黨部所在地的南院門，卽是西安的「南京路」。這裏商業的繁盛，自然無可與上海南京路相比擬。但就西安的商業中心區來說，南院門的確比任何街道熱鬧得多！</p>
<p>如果說上海的商店，爲了應付不景氣的巿塲，而普遍舉行减價競爭的話，西安「南京路」的商人，則因不景氣反而更是居奇，「敲竹槓」！</p>
<p>他們利用貨物販運的不便，和巿塲上某幾項商品的缺乏，你不買則己，要買就須付予高额的代價。他們知道：顧客絶不會因一隻永備電筒，在上海賣一元，到西安後賣五元，便憤而專門乘車來上海直接購買的！</p>
<p>因爲商人們的「居奇」，使顧客不敢問津，遂致南院門的商店門可羅雀。然而只要跑進一位顧客時，那便無論你買多買少丨丨只要從上海天津等處販運的東西丨丨他們總得給你一筆大的竹槓！</p>
<p>（五）東馬路郵局門前</p>
<p>上海的測字攤，較上等的集中於城隍廟，其次多散佈於工人區域。西安的測字攤，却一律排列在東馬路的郵局門前。據說，這是合乎經濟原則的！郵局是郵寄信件的機關；測字先生利用代書信函的副業，設帳於郵局門前，眞乃是生產合理化了！</p>
<p>郵局對過的ＸＸ園（忘了！）是西安高級的人肉巿塲。由總門進去，裏面有無數舊式的平房，（間有幾處破壞的樓房）三面圍繞，圈成一個大的罌粟形的廣塲，而ＸＸ　的總門則洽似一隻緊縮的瓶口。</p>
<p>山東的，河南的，天津的，淮揚的，以及本地土產的嬌娃，當那夕陽西墜之時，三五成羣地依門賣俏。入夜，廣塲邊幾家較大的書寓門口，掛起雪亮的煤氣燈，招誘遊人，絃歌之聲相望不了絶。</p>

<h3>好萊塢的鬼屋　潘德凱爾登的新居（上）</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>樓下呻吟之聲不絶於耳</p>
<p>屋外樹枝　接共作長鳴</p>
<p>我們中國人搬家，一定要打聽房子的吉凶。死人的，出過情形的房子，人家就是敢住。許多人說這是中國人迷信太深的緣故，其實在外國地方，對於這種事情亦時有所聞的。就是在電影中看視的，亦不一而足。當然，這大半是出之於滑稽，然而我們在電影中所看見的，無論是否出之於滑稽，它總有社會思想作爲根據，才能爲一班人所了解。外國人對於凶屋（Ｈａｕｎｔｅｄｂｏｕｓｅ），亦是很害怕的。有時候屋子裏半夜鬼物出沒，顯出種種駭人的形狀，任你一等不迷信的人，亦無法對付，祇可遷地爲良了。我們現在且述好萊塢的鬼屋事，當然我不能斷定宇宙間鬼物之有無，不過好萊塢旣有此事發生，並且有電影雜誌詳紀其事，余姑妄譯之，讀者亦姑妄聽之可也。</p>
<p>好萊塢的女明星潘德凱爾登（ＰｅｒｔＫｅｌｔｏｎ），不久之前在好萊塢的近郊買了一所意大利式的别墅，裏面有大房間八間。那是一所很精緻的房子，但是恐怕太古舊了些，因爲在會客室裏所陳歷的，都是眞正意大利運來的古董。屋外樹木靑葱，繞屋四週，枝葉茂盛，迎風搖拂，但是恐怕太淸幽了些。潘德凱爾登看見了那所房子，就愛得非常可愛，立刻卽買了下來。她買了那所房子之後，和她同居的，祇有她母親一人，此外還有她表姊妹一人。除了一家數口之外，四週别無隣居，眞是呼援不應的。潘德凱爾登是個胆大的女子。自從她們搬進去之後，她們就每夜聽見歎息呻吟之聲，自地下層一陣一陣的升上來。此外還有重物錘擊之聲，和手指抓爬牆壁之聲，連幾不斷地發出來。再則客室裏面，電燈的開關，時時吉各作聲，但又並電光自燈泡中發生，甚至電燈開關，完全受了鬼物的支配，潘德自己去開電燈都開不亮。吉吉各各，竟和地下層中的呻吟合成了節奏。</p>
<p>在一天早晨四時，天尙未明的時候，地下層可怡的呻吟聲大作，潘德於是立卽將無綫電警察呌了來。他們跑進了地下層視察了一週，並無一些東西發現。他們說那裏旣沒有鬼，亦沒有。賊。但是等他們一走，呻吟的聲音又發作了。「難道那是我神經錯亂所致？」潘德說，「但是我却難以置信。因爲聽見的不是我一個人，難道我的母親和我的表妹，和我一様地神經錯亂嗎？後來恐佈深入了我的心中，我夜中睡不着了。我時常一夜醒着，靜聽各種怪異之聲的絡續發現。有時來了一聲深長的呻吟，從樓下升了上來，令人毛骨悚然。幸虧我們的兩間臥旁，是在樓上的。（未完）</p>

<h3>評「歸眞返璞」</h3>
<p>— 胡越</p>
<p>Ｍａｎｉｆｗｏｗｏｒｌｄｓ丨大上海　　「愛斯基摩」是描寫了帝國主義怎様侵略壓迫愛斯基摩人的一部作品，但在這「歸眞返璞」中是找不到的，這裏有的是一篇戀愛的小詩，是愛神對於民族的偏見的詛咒，是一首偉大的獵人的頌讚。總之是張别饒風味的戀愛片。</p>
<p>帝國主義國家派出的科學探險隊，實際上，不外是侵略者的急先鋒，（自然我們不否認其在科學上的相當價値），這在我國已經屢次的得到了證明，然而在這裏，其眞面目是被掩蓋住了。</p>
<p>「歸眞返璞」的成功，是得到編劇ＨｏｗａｒｄＪ、Ｇｒｅｎ和ＡｉｎｓｗｏｒｔｈＭｏｒｇａｎ等很大的帮助的，這就是說，以一個樸素的落後的愛斯基摩人的世界與現代資本主義的文明世界來對比，以一個天眞的偉大的獵人的純潔的愛來打動觀衆，以民族的偏見來造成一個愛的悲劇，在最後，更以那偉大獵人的重生來作結，使這一個戀愛故事超出一切爛熟的，膩煩的陳舊的濫調，而換一換觀衆的口味。</p>
<p>「歸眞返璞」的描寫一個愛斯基摩人剛接觸到近代的新奇和不懂事，然而是可愛的天眞，是很有趣的，特别是亞谷在汽車中瞻賞車外的都會風光的美麗的複寫，微妙的刻劃出兩個世界的不同。</p>
<p>同様美妙的是結束時，亞谷已還到了他的故鄕，在風雪中廻憶起英倫的女子瓊的可愛與可怕的失戀，及危坐默憶與被孩子感動而恢復其獵人面目的令人悠然的塲面。</p>
<p>在這裏，亞谷的眞摯的愛是寫得多麽令人感動，從他的簡單的字彙與錯誤的文法所構成的率直而又委婉的辭句上，從他的珍重，快慰與愚昧的自嘲上，都可以使觀衆愛他，因爲他是這様的粗獷而天眞。</p>
<p>但是，威士忌酒毁滅了他的美麗的夢，而在實際上，每一個觀衆都會知道是民族的偏見殺害了他的愛情。當觀衆看到他的不得不聽從人家的說服而回到家鄕，看到他在風雪中痛苦地回憶而仆倒在荒原上，每一個都會同情他，或許還不止是覺得這個野蠻的獵人的可笑可憐，而引起對於民族偏見的厭惡吧。</p>
<p>「歸眞反璞」正惟因此而應得到比那庸俗的平凡的羅曼史更高的評價。這是根據了盎斯槐斯毛根的原作小說的，對於這位作家我們也得在這裏提起一下的。</p>
<p>至於結束的一種重生的歡喜，使這個劇本留下了不少的餘味。</p>
<p>飾亞谷的佛萊賽勒特的演技，的確是很成功的，不僅是面部表情的老練，他是以整個的把握住了個性的活動來獲取了勝利。看膩了平庸的戀愛故事而講趣味的觀衆，倒不妨去換一下口味。</p>

<h3>「巴黎之光」評</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>ＭｉｒａｇｅｓｄｅＰａｒｉｓ丨巴黎</p>
<p>「莫斯科奇情案」導演范獨爾渥若伯ＦｅｉｄｏｒＯｚｅｐ的又一部作品「巴黎之光」，描寫的是一個羅曼史，充滿着法蘭西情調的一篇故事。</p>
<p>紅伶人與女學生的戀愛史，穿揷了綁架，搶刦等等。然而我們在這裏所能看到的，不是法蘭西社會的一角剪影，而是一個粉紅色的夢！</p>
<p>編劇上的曲折是很明顯的優點吧，但是這些曲折覺得過分的矯揉造作，尤其强盜贈肉票以珍貴的胸針一節，眞太徒勞了。</p>
<p>導演的手法，還是有着他的特色。律動的抑揚與靜特的處理，在開頭的巴黎鐵塔，窗外景色以及後面的汽車的往來，夜的景色等畫面，在劇塲中的熱鬧空氣與寓所中的談愛的交織，這些地方都是很好的。</p>
<p>但是水壺蓋子的自蓋，以及臨了劇塲中觀衆的情緒的描寫，都是太誇張，而且太常識化，有着很濃重的羅曼蒂克氣氛。</p>
<p>不能不稱讚的是對於曼麗個性的明確的刻劃，以及賈哥玲茀倫雪的演技的成功，如曼麗在與方叔第一次招呼時的遲疑，以及方叔的妻對付她的方法來對付纏繞她的男子們等地方。</p>
<p>然而，這「巴黎之光」究竟有什麽意義呢？</p>
<p>女學生的戀愛與藝術兩方面，都得到成功，而在熱烈的愛的藝術的空氣中，結束了全劇，這是在醜惡的現實上粉飾一通，使觀衆忘記了世界的動亂。</p>
<p>這一部粉飾現實的作部，在現在還能有進步的意義嗎？</p>

<p>— 擷華</p>
<p>她惟一排除愁恨的方法，惟有工作。她的所以不辭勞苦的原因亦卽在此。但是她爲自己的不幸，所不肯流的眼涙，到了看護的休息室裏，就不禁奪眶而出了！因爲醫院裏一個小孩子，她所衷心愛護的一個，竟死了。舒樂絲尋著子她，連忙抱了她，安慰著她；「心肝，你總哭，爲什麽呀？」朋咽哽著說不出話來。最後她哭着道；「爲什麽他要死呢？他的生命還沒有開始哩；人生在世他能看見的，去做的，還多着哩！」這幾句話，直等到她眼涙止住了，還在她芳心中盤旋着。人生如朝露，生死尤不可測。到底人生是怎麽回事丨憂面有些什麽丨或者葛雷格　瑙萊是不錯的。</p>
<p>葛雷格康瑙萊呢，他時常將他的人生觀，灌輸到她乾枯的心田裏。人生是不應當過於嚴重看待的，有享樂時應享樂。旣不必爲過去而掉涙，亦不必爲將來而擔憂，惟有眼前片刻的歡娱，是眞實的，應當抓住了而不放棄的。所以自從朋登告訴了他一切實在情形之後，他就百計的譬解給她聽。她的丈夫雖沒有死，他已成了一個瘋人，關在瘋人院裏，他淸醒的時候，一天比一天少，但是「你沒有辜負他呀。你亦沒有欠他什麽呀。他不是已經將所有一切的丈夫的權利完全放棄了嗎？爲什麽你要受這種境遇的欺騙壓迫，而放棄了人生的一切快樂呢？那不是他自己的過處嗎？他不是差不多連你的生命都害了嗎？」康瑙萊道様地一層一層講給她聽。使她日積月漸，有不得不受其惑之勢。</p>
<p>不久舒樂絲亦已有了愛人了。那是一位年輕的警士。當舒樂和他訂了婚之後，葛雷格康瑙萊，就爲她設了慶賀的筵席。當然，這次歡宴的目的，不在舒樂絲訂婚的慶祝，而在進一步的向朋登進攻。當一般賓客歡然談笑之中，朋登獨自一個人溜到陽台上。康瑙萊就如影之隨形，跟踪了去。他看她穿了一身樸實無華的晚服，越顯得她麗質天生，不同凡艷，而織腰一握，上面綴著他送給她的鮮花。她看見他跟了出來，未免芳心一動，而他呢，亦重爲她的美貌所誘，且玉人近在咫尺，欲得之念更熾。於是他就走了上去，一手攬住了她的織腰，嘴凑上去，吻着她的櫻唇。朋登亦情不自禁地覺著一腔春意，頗有躍躍復活之勢。這時康瑙萊的嘴，凑在她的耳邊說道；「别辜負了你自己的歲月丨並且辜負了我丨辜負了你我深切相愛的事實···」朋登聽了，突然間倒退了一步。「但是我不能辜負我對於他的忠心，」她說。「康瑙萊不覺義憤塡胸地說道；忠心！忠心於什麽？忠心於一個不可忍受的婚約？忠心於已經毁滅的愛？」朋登無可奈何的搖着頭說道；「我還有我的責任，我不能就此擺脫。這點，我求你丨丨設法諒解我的苦衷吧。」她顯然地懇求着他了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Lower Guan Japanese Warships Use Pretext of Protecting Nationals to Conspire and Coordinate with Forces on Land</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the disappearance of Japanese Deputy Consul Zangben in Nanjing, as of the evening of the 10th, his whereabouts are still unknown. The capital's garrison headquarters and police department are doing their best to investigate. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Consul stationed in Nanjing stated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 9th that Deputy Consul Zangben escorted Minister Youji to the Xiaguan Railway Station to board the train, but his whereabouts became unknown. He requested an investigation. It is learned that after receiving the report, President Wang immediately issued a strict order to the capital's military and police organs, such as the garrison headquarters and police department, to do their best to investigate, striving to find a resolution to the disappearance of Zangben. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese Consulate stationed in Nanjing sent personnel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, garrison headquarters, and police department on the 9th to report the disappearance of Deputy Consul Zangben, our government authorities paid great attention and ordered the military police to launch a full investigation. The garrison headquarters and police department also sent personnel to the consulate to inquire about the detailed circumstances to serve as a basis for the investigation. However, two days and nights have passed since the reported time of disappearance, and no clues have been obtained. Today, the matter has become a topic of conversation in society. Generally, people regard it as an unprecedented and strange mystery in the capital. Regarding the reported disappearance of Deputy Consul Zangben, there are two different accounts. One is that Deputy Consul Zangben disappeared after seeing Minister Youji off at Xiaguan Railway Station at 11 PM on the 8th. The other is that Minister Youji attended a Ministry of Foreign Affairs banquet on the evening of the 8th, and because it was late, he did not return to the consulate. Instead, he telephoned the consulate from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the minister, along with Consul General Suma, Counselor Arino, and others, would go directly to Xiaguan Railway Station from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and instructed the consulate to send his luggage to the station. After receiving the call, the consulate dispatched personnel such as Deputy Consul Asami and Tanaka, leading consulate staff to hire two cars, and transport the luggage to the station to see them off. At that time, Deputy Consul Zangben was on his way from his residence at No. 62 Yinyang Camp, Gulou, to the consulate, intending to go to Xiaguan Railway Station in the same car. However, because the cars were full, the consulate sent people out to find rental cars, and from then on, he disappeared. If the disappearance of Deputy Consul Zangben belongs to the first account, then the disappearance at Xiaguan Railway Station, with its lively atmosphere and large number of passengers, is almost unprecedented. If it belongs to the second account, then the Gulou area is the location of the Japanese Consulate General and the residence of Japanese expatriates, under special and close military and police protection. Moreover, the Japanese Consulate's habit of using cars has always been to dispatch cars from Ding San Automobile Shop at Ten Temple Intersection, Gulou, to the consulate for standby use. Even if Deputy Consul Zangben went to Ding San Automobile Shop to hire a car this time, the distance from the consulate to the car shop is only a few hundred steps. This road is brightly lit and has continuous traffic. The disappearance is also unprecedented. Moreover, the capital's military police organization has always been strict, and the area is very quiet, with no unexpected incidents occurring. After two days and nights of investigation into the disappearance of Deputy Consul Zangben, no clues have been found, which shows the difficulty of the matter. However, when reporters inquired about the government authorities' attitude today, they all expressed that the military police will use their full strength to investigate. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Consul Zangben, who recently disappeared, has been the subject of tireless searches by various parties, day and night. Multiple investigations have failed to reveal his whereabouts. People are generally very worried and are expressing a sense of despair. The matter remains completely shrouded in mystery, with no clear understanding of what happened. Zangben's residence is not far from the Consulate General, with mulberry fields and the Jinling University agricultural field along the way. The population near his residence is somewhat sparse, but the road he took is a new asphalt road, and every few hundred steps there are military police patrolling and maintaining a serious watch. Everything was normal that day, with no disturbances, so it is natural that it attracted the attention of officials and police. However, if there were no security measures, the disappearance of the individual is even more of an unfathomable mystery. Currently, those in charge of the search are the head of the police station, Shimizu, and Consul General Suma, who is in a supervisory position. They are extremely concerned about this matter and are exploring various countermeasures. The Japanese warship Fushimi, currently stationed in Xiaguan, moored last night at the Nisshin Shipping Company's dock. The captain, Major Abe, and others are trying to establish contact with forces on land in order to protect Japanese nationals and to find traces of Zangben. (10th Japan Union News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to the unresolved disappearance of Deputy Consul Zangben, the head of the Shimizu Police Station directed search teams this morning to search for possible leads in Yanzi Rock and other suspicious areas in the suburbs of Nanjing. (10th Den Tsushin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The commander of the military police directly responsible for the security of Nanjing, Gu Zhenglun, visited Japanese Army Attaché Takahashi at 9:00 AM today to report on the disappearance of Deputy Consul Zangben, stating that the military police are making every effort to search, but there are still no leads, but they will strive to clarify the truth of the incident as soon as possible. (10th Den Tsushin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The whereabouts of Deputy Consul Zangben remain unknown, and it is unclear whether he is alive or dead. The head of the investigation, Shimizu, led several officers from his station to explore the riverbank area outside Nanjing and Yanzi Rock this morning, in case of the worst. This area is about five or six English miles downstream from the city of Nanjing, with many strange rocks and a scenic spot overlooking the river. Many people from Nanjing like to visit this place, and recently many people who commit suicide by jumping into the river do so here. Nearby is an execution ground for prisoners sentenced to death by firing squad, originally a famous scenic area. (10th Japan Union News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials invited Japanese candidate diplomat Asami to the ministry to inquire about the details of the Zangben disappearance case. Asami recounted the detailed circumstances of the case, followed by the following discussion: Yesterday, the situation of Zangben's disappearance had been explained to the police department and military police headquarters, and they were asked to investigate and protect him. The police department dispatched an inspector to the Japanese Consulate to establish contact for investigation purposes. (10th Japan Union News Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Laborers Recruited by the Japanese Side Suffer Oppression</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the previous three months, the Japanese side recruited more than 10,000 Chinese laborers from North China. The laborers were transported by Okura &amp; Co. to Gubeikou and then to Chengde. More than 500 laborers were stationed in Gubeikou, Taihezhuang, and Shiliang each village, and each had a foreman to lead them. They have been waiting for orders for more than two months, and the workers have not received a penny. Food supplies have been cut off, and the groups have used violence against the foremen to demand wages. The foremen are also unable to maintain order. Most of them have now fled, and the rest have no way to return home. The Japanese are extremely strict in their surveillance of them, and the situation is very tragic. The workers who have been transported outside the border, except for the strong who have been incorporated into the puppet army, the old and weak are driven to build roads between Chahar East and Chengde. Now, due to excessive rainfall, the automobile road has been washed out, and workers are being driven day and night to rush to repair it. All Chinese laborers, in addition to two meals of millet rice per day, do not receive a single penny, and if there is any slackening, they are severely beaten. The workers are all in tears and lamenting bitterly. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chinese laborers recruited by a certain party in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Chahar, who landed in the puppet country from Dalian and Yingkou, are still arriving continuously. A Labor Association has now been established in Changchun, with 25,000 members. Labor branch associations have been established in Harbin, Dalian, Mudanjiang, Dunhua, Muling, Ningguta, and other places. The president of the general association is the Japanese Nakata Yukio, and the branch presidents are also Japanese. It is heard that the workers' wages have not been paid for several months. If a large number of people demand their wages, they are accused of being communists. In the Longmen Town area, several people have already been executed. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan and Qin Decun Postpone Return to Chahar Yesterday</h3>

Qin Decun said that the Japanese army in eastern Chahar has not taken any active actions recently, but they are secretly preparing for something. The content of the Japanese army's division commander meeting held in Chengde is impossible to guess. It is difficult to predict whether the Japanese army in eastern Chahar will take any new actions after the meeting ends. The Yang Monkey Xiaobu (troop) is still training in the Gongjigou area after being reorganized. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Crisis and Way Out of China's Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The decline of China's silk industry has become a well-known fact worldwide. Taking the amount transported on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway as an example, the annual average used to be 150,000 to 160,000 bales, but last year it had dropped to just over 50,000 bales. This year, it is less than 40,000 bales. Although high railway freight rates and silk merchants switching to water transport are also factors in the decrease, the fundamental problem lies in the overall global economic downturn. The real cause of the economic panic is the imbalance between general consumption and production. The more goods are piled up, the more consumers' purchasing power shrinks, leading to a panic in the market. Silk is a common sight to those who live in cities and is not surprising. But its price is too expensive, and it is seen as a luxury item by those below the middle class. Thus, during times of economic downturn, raw silk and silk products are particularly severely affected. As for the decline of China's silk industry, in addition to being affected by the global economic downturn, there are also special reasons. These are analyzed as follows: First, the artificial silk industry is gradually developing. Although its quality is not always good, its market price is only one-third to one-half of that of silk. As a result, people are happy to buy it. In European and American countries that do not produce silk, artificial silk is often used as a substitute. Even in China, which claims to be the birthplace of the world's silk industry, artificial silk has become an important consumer, further eclipsing silk. Second, twenty years ago, China was said to be unrivaled in the world's raw silk and silk products market. However, due to improvements in Japan and the rise of India, the position of China's silk industry in overseas markets has gradually declined. In addition, those in the industry have failed to fully understand the situation in overseas markets, and the quality of raw silk is often not suitable for mechanical weaving. All sales matters are also carried out according to old rules and have not been improved. Therefore, after the rise of Japanese silk, not only has China's market share in the United States been taken over, but sales west of the Indian Ocean have also declined. Third, those who run the silk business in China mostly value immediate profits and ignore the future. People in the same industry have paid little attention to the common path of unity and external development. Therefore, they cannot compete actively with others. With these three special reasons, the decline of Chinese silk is naturally not surprising.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that China's rural economy has been severely hit by the decline of the silk industry. The rural economy in China has always relied on side businesses in addition to crop harvests for adjustment. If farmers rely solely on crop production without any other income, they will work hard but earn little profit. With the import of mechanical products in recent years, farmers' consumption has also increased considerably, making the support of side businesses all the more essential. In the rural areas of the provinces in the Yellow River basin, farmers' side businesses are not very developed, so they are not as prosperous as those in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Sericulture has always been the most profitable side business for farmers. Outside of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, farm families in Sichuan, Guangdong, and Shandong provinces also rely heavily on the harvest of spring cocoons for turnover. Even their clothing needs are entirely dependent on this. Now that the price of raw cocoons has fallen, the income from mulberry cultivation for farm families cannot even cover the cost of fertilizers and rent. Therefore, the practice of stopping the cultivation of mulberry seedlings and cutting down mulberry trees is common everywhere. As a result, the countryside has lost a side business, and the livelihood of silk workers in the cities is also affected. Since both farmers and workers suffer, merchants who operate the buying and selling of raw silk and silk products naturally cannot escape unscathed.</p>
<p>The only lifeline for the future of China's silk industry lies first in improving the quality of silk. Those in the silk industry should work together harmoniously and develop externally. Government authorities must also actively promote and reward them. It is heard that the Executive Yuan has recently approved fundamental measures to help the silk industry, which can be said to be a somewhat satisfactory event. However, concrete results remain to be seen. In recent months, economic relations between Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands have become increasingly strained, and the move to boycott Japanese silk has become almost universal worldwide. This is a good opportunity for the Chinese silk industry to unite and strive to restore overseas markets and re-establish the foundation of the silk industry. As for the domestic market, it is particularly important to maintain it properly. For example, durability is an inherent strength of Chinese silk. If Chinese silk manufacturers cannot innovate in design to win temporary aesthetics, they should at least not abandon their inherent advantages, so that they will not be rejected by those who value practicality and despised by those who value fashion.</p>
<p>The Little Entente Resumes Relations with Russia</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Russia Formally Exchange Letters, Mutual Agreement to Respect Sovereignty, Anti-German Front Becomes More Solid, Yugoslavia's Attitude Remains to Be Decided</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Romania and Czechoslovakia officially recognized the Soviet Russian government today. The Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and the Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente countries met until 1:00 AM this morning. It was announced after the meeting that Czech Foreign Minister Benes and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Litvinov exchanged documents at noon, establishing normal relations between Czechoslovakia and Soviet Russia and between Romania and Soviet Russia. It is said that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yeftić will announce Yugoslavia's attitude on the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia after returning to Belgrade to report to the government. It is heard that King Alexander of Yugoslavia is against recognizing the Soviet Russian government, so the Little Entente countries have now abandoned their unified action. (9th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The documents exchanged between Romania and Soviet Russia for the recognition of Soviet Russia were signed here today. The signing took place at the Berg Hotel where Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu was staying. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, Czech Foreign Minister Benes, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yeftić were all present. Litvinov and Titulescu exchanged two sets of documents. (The first set of documents was a document in which both countries stated their willingness to restore diplomatic relations. The second set of documents was a mutual agreement to respect sovereignty and not engage in propaganda activities.) The documents were both worded in an active tone, not one party proposing and the other responding. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Romania has already recognized Soviet Russia. Prior to this, the two countries had agreed to respect each other's sovereignty. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov proved this in a letter, saying that the two governments agreed to respect sovereignty and not to interfere directly or indirectly in each other's internal affairs, especially to avoid all propaganda activities. They also agreed not to organize groups that disrupt the other's country, not to assist those who organize themselves, and not to allow them to stay within their borders. Armed forces and military weapons used to support these disruptive groups are prohibited from entering or passing through the country. The Romanian Foreign Minister also sent a similar letter to Litvinov. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Another Step for Russia to Join the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials are greatly pleased by the news that the Little Entente countries have established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Russian government.  It is reported that Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and diplomatic authorities of Czechoslovakia and Romania have exchanged letters regarding normal relations between Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia and Romania.  It is generally expected that Yugoslavia will also restore relations with Russia after its Foreign Minister Jevtić returns from Paris.  The Little Entente countries announced their recognition of Soviet Russia here today, which is seen as another step for Russia to join the League of Nations. It is expected that the matter of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations can be resolved satisfactorily in September. At the same time, Litvinov is currently preparing a plan for a mutual assistance pact in Eastern Europe. France is also very concerned about this matter. Not only the Little Entente countries, but also Germany and Poland have been invited to participate, but neither of these countries has expressed willingness to accept the invitation. (Ninth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Exchange of Notes between Romania, Czechoslovakia and Russia</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The documents of recognition of Soviet Russia by Czechoslovakia and Romania were released tonight by the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries. The content of the resolution of the Political Council on this matter is reported as follows: The resolution stated that on June 9, 1934, Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš exchanged identical public documents in Geneva, restoring normal diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia. Romania and Soviet Russia also exchanged similar public documents, restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries. As for the Yugoslav government, because its Foreign Minister Jevtić had to formally visit Paris, a definite decision on this issue would have to wait until Jevtić returned home and reported. This was decided by the governments of the Little Entente countries after several days of negotiations between the members of the Standing Political Council and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Therefore, public documents were exchanged today to implement the restoration of diplomatic relations. The letter from Czech Foreign Minister Beneš to Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov is announced as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, on January 22, 1934, the Foreign Ministers of the three Little Entente countries, during the Zagreb Conference, mutually agreed that once the diplomatic and political situation was appropriate, the Little Entente countries should restore normal diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. After talks between our Foreign Minister and your Foreign Commissar in early June of this year, the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries believed that, given the current diplomatic and political situation, the Little Entente countries could, in accordance with the Zagreb resolution, separately restore diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. After negotiations with your Foreign Commissar, the Czech government has now decided to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Russian government and has decided to appoint a plenipotentiary minister to reside in your country.  I am writing this special letter to convey that our Foreign Minister deeply believes that after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, there will be lasting harmony, and that the two nations will be able to cooperate with each other in the future to seek each other's prosperity and maintain world peace, etc.</p>
<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu also sent a letter to Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, with the same content. Litvinov also sent letters with similar wording to Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, after talks between the Soviet Russian government and your Foreign Minister, it has been decided to establish diplomatic relations with the Czech (or Romanian) government and to send a plenipotentiary minister. I am writing this special letter to convey that our Foreign Commissar deeply believes that after the restoration of diplomatic relations between our countries, there will be lasting harmony, and that our peoples will be able to cooperate with each other in the future to seek common prosperity and maintain world peace, etc. (Ninth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>A New Link Added to the Chain of Peace - Comments from Polish Newspapers</h3>
<p>Warsaw The semi-official "Polish Daily" commented on the recognition of Soviet Russia by Romania and Czechoslovakia, stating, "The recognition of Soviet Russia by the two countries is of particular concern to us, as Soviet Russia is Poland's neighbor and an allied country. The Little Entente's recognition of Soviet Russia is what we have earnestly prayed for and strived for." The newspaper also stated that Romania's recognition of Soviet Russia has significant political implications. As for the obstacles to diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia and Soviet Russia, they are mostly due to differences in economic organization. The newspaper believes that "the rapprochement between Czechoslovakia and Soviet Russia is not only politically beneficial, but also philosophically beneficial." The government party's "Polish Express" views the Little Entente countries' recognition of Soviet Russia as adding a new link to the chain of peace, which is highly gratifying. (Tenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Political and Economic Factors Form an Anti-German Bloc</h3>
<p>Prague The resumption of normal diplomatic relations between the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia was officially announced at 5:00 PM. This matter was generally expected, so public opinion did not find it surprising. The State Council fully approved of the decision of the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries in Geneva. Major Czech industrialists and bankers had long hoped for the restoration of normal relations between the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia for business reasons. All newspapers stated that this recognition coincided with Soviet Russia's re-participation in European politics, which has significant international implications. Moreover, the Little Entente countries' recognition of Soviet Russia comes at a time when Soviet Russia, France, and the Little Entente countries are becoming increasingly close. This is tantamount to a group of countries forming a bloc to guard against Germany under Hitlerism and prevent it from causing harm. (Ninth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Romanian People Erupt in Joy Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>Bucharest The news of the Little Entente countries' recognition of Soviet Russia was announced here last night, and the people of the capital were greatly surprised. Although this matter had been brewing for several months, and everyone knew that recognition was inevitable, the sudden turn of events made people feel deeply satisfied and relieved of their worries. Therefore, the sudden receipt of this news was met with a mixture of surprise and joy. The newspaper commentaries here are too numerous to mention, but special mention should be made of the commentary in the "Universal" newspaper. This newspaper is the organ of the right wing and speaks for the Romanian nationalist faction. Its commentary on this matter hailed it as a great success for Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and considered it the most important event in all of the Romanian government's diplomatic activities since the Great War, showering it with praise.

<h3>German Newspapers Believe it is a Manifestation of French Policy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Czech and Romanian countries of the Little Entente have already recognized Soviet Russia. German newspapers say that this is a manifestation of French policy, and that it was facilitated by French Foreign Minister Barthou. Most newspapers say that Barthou will attend the Little Entente countries' meeting held in the Romanian capital from June 18 to 20, which shows that the negotiations between Soviet Russia and the Little Entente countries were orchestrated by Paris. The German General News Agency said that since the London Economic Conference in 1933, when Litvinov signed non-aggression treaties with various countries (with Persia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Latvia, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, etc., around July 3-4), the Little Entente countries had already recognized Soviet Russia in fact. Since then, a new chapter has begun in the diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and the countries of southeastern Europe.</p>
<h3>Further Steps Will Be Taken to Conclude Economic Agreements</h3>
<p>After this legal recognition, it is likely that the Little Entente countries will continue to conclude economic agreements with Soviet Russia, as the dumping of Soviet Russian timber and wheat has already caused great losses to southeastern Europe.</p>
<h3>Abandoning Bessarabia as a Condition for Exchange of Recognition</h3>
<p>The Berlin Stock Exchange Daily stated that the dispute between Romania and Soviet Russia over the province of Bessarabia was not mentioned thanks to the mediation of France. The newspaper also said that, in its opinion, Romania was able to recognize Soviet Russia because Moscow had more or less admitted to abandoning the province of Bessarabia. Soviet Russia was able to be sincere about this matter because it was influenced by developments in the Far East. (Ninth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Amidst Dangerous Russian-Japanese Relations - Japanese Public Relations Abroad - European and American Public Opinion Unfavorable to Japan - Japan Claims It is an Attempt to Sow Discord</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the Foreign Ministry's Information Bureau received news of European and American countries criticizing the border disputes between Japan, the puppet state, and Russia. They felt that European and American criticisms were unfavorable to Japan, and some even said that Japan intended to provoke conflict. Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed the so-called truth about the border disputes to ambassadors abroad yesterday and ordered the ambassadors to conduct pro-Japanese public relations locally. (Tenth China United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, malicious propaganda alleging dangerous situations between Japan and Soviet Russia and other countries has been prevalent in Europe and America. In addition, because the Soviet Union had provocative actions on the Russian-Japanese-"Manchukuo" border, it has repeatedly spread propaganda that Japanese-Soviet relations are about to deteriorate, which is not without basis. In view of this situation, the foreign affairs authorities felt it necessary to clarify the Japanese government's attitude toward foreign countries in order to give the world a correct understanding. Foreign Minister Hirota issued instructions on the 9th to ambassadors abroad to report the truth about the facts existing between Japan and Russia in order to prevent malicious propaganda. One extreme example of this malicious propaganda is the report from Japanese Minister Ito stationed in Poland, which stated that Polish newspapers carried fabricated content of a meeting in Moscow between Soviet Army Commander Bulganin, Turkish Air Force Representative Celal Bey, and the military attache of the Turkish Embassy. The content is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In early March of this year, the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities claimed to the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires in Japan that if war between Japan and Russia became unavoidable, then the Caucasus Security Guarantee signed between Turkey and the Soviet Union would have to be forcibly broken. When Commander Matsushita of the Japanese Training Squadron visited Ankara, he also discussed the situation of war between Japan and Russia. It was said that since Turkey and Japan were on the same front, Japan would spare no effort in the free movement of Turkey's Caucasus region, the supply of weapons to the Turkish Navy, or the construction of fortresses along the coast. This was the Commander's proposal, which was immediately reported by Turkey to the Soviet authorities. As a result, Foreign Commissar Litvinov was dispatched to Geneva to find ways to get the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations and form a mutual assistance treaty with France, which has now become a form of Russian-French military alliance, etc. (Tenth Japan United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reports of Unrest in Outer Mongolia - Residents Fleeing to Seek Refuge</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received from a certain place, the Red influence in Outer Mongolia has recently become quite active, and the residents are feeling uneasy. In particular, the restrictions on raising livestock are very strict, so the threatened people are fleeing to Inner Mongolia. Recently, the number of refugees has been increasing daily, and the various banners are struggling to accommodate them. The Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission plans to provide the displaced people with a place to live in order to provide relief and is said to be allocating 500,000 yuan, but has not actually provided any assistance. According to the Nanjing government's investigation, the number of refugees in various places has reached 5,000, and approximately 10,000 have taken refuge in places near Outer Mongolia. Therefore, the Mongolians have an extreme antipathy toward the current regime in Outer Mongolia, and the Red movement in that area will become increasingly fierce in the future, which is attracting widespread attention.

<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Attacks Qiuzhuang Station - Burning Station Buildings and Shooting False Police</h3>
<p>China United Press Andong Dispatch At 0:20 AM on June 1, when a train from Andong to Shenyang arrived at Qiuzhuang Station, it was suddenly attacked by more than 40 members of the Volunteer Army. The railway guards and false police, about 200 in number, fought fiercely with the Volunteer Army and telegraphed the Japanese police team in Fenghuangcheng and the Japanese army in Jiguan Mountain for assistance. The Volunteer Army was outnumbered and, after a long fierce battle, set fire to the station's freight yard and more than 40 houses of station staff, shot four false police officers, and retreated.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Passes Through El Salvador - Transportation Cut Off and Severe Damage</h3>
<p>(New York) A hurricane has passed through the Central American country of El Salvador, causing hardship for many people. However, due to transportation disruptions, it is difficult to estimate the actual extent of the disaster. Roads in the disaster area have been damaged and are only passable on foot. The railway has been severely damaged and will not be restored to its original state for two months. All ships in the "free" port are temporarily prohibited from entering. Some towns and villages are still flooded, and there is a risk of the spread of various infectious diseases such as dysentery and typhoid fever. (Ninth Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt to Tour Honolulu Next Month - Preparing to Meet with Japanese Political Leaders - Hoping to Clear Up Misunderstandings Between the Two Countries - Japanese Report White House Implicit Approval</h3>
<p>(Washington) The rumor that President Roosevelt plans to meet with senior Japanese politicians in Honolulu in early July has sparked speculation in political circles today about what the outcome will be. The President has indicated that he will tour the Pacific after Congress adjourns and may meet with Japanese politicians while passing through Honolulu. This meeting was tentatively agreed upon yesterday during the White House's reception for Prince Konoe, Speaker of the Japanese House of Peers. It is widely believed that if the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister can attend this meeting, it will definitely clear up misunderstandings between Japan and the United States and will have a major impact on the naval disarmament conference to be held next year. This meeting will give Japan and the United States a direct opportunity to discuss international issues that have caused disputes between the two countries. These include the issue of the Open Door Policy in China caused by Japan's declaration of closing off China, the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo," the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty, the issue of naval ratios, the issue of the status of the Philippines after independence, and the issue of Japanese immigration. President Roosevelt has not indicated to what extent he will discuss these complex and important issues. In fact, the President did not even mention this meeting. This meeting was reported by Japanese people attending the White House banquet, but the White House has not denied it. (Ninth National News dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Two Great Powers of Italy and Germany Meet in Venice - Disarmament and International Affairs are the Main Topics of Discussion - French Foreign Minister Also Invited to Participate in Talks</h3>
<p>Rome It is reported that when German Chancellor Hitler comes to meet Prime Minister Mussolini, he will travel by plane. Because of the unfortunate incidents that have occurred repeatedly in the past year, which have strained relations between Germany and Austria, the German Chancellor intends to avoid passing through Austrian territory. It is reported that the main issues to be discussed by the two Prime Ministers are disarmament and the League of Nations. The Italian side said that Prime Minister Mussolini intends to strongly urge Hitler to adopt a moderate approach to prevent the arms race, and will pay particular attention to urging Germany to rejoin the League of Nations. (Ninth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to recent reports, before French Foreign Minister Barthou left Geneva to return to France, he received a notification from the Italian government stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler would meet in Venice next week. Italy notified Barthou because he had a plan to visit Rome in the near future, and Mussolini suggested that the French Foreign Minister and the German Chancellor should make their visits to Italy in a way that would not conflict. (Ninth National News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources, although French Foreign Minister Barthou has been invited to participate in the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, Barthou is unlikely to visit Rome before autumn. The French government now believes that the time is ripe for the French Foreign Minister to deal directly with the German Chancellor, so there should be no problem with the French Foreign Minister participating in the talks between the two Prime Ministers. (Ninth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany's Hope for Rejoining the League of Nations Remains Slim</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since the amended French proposal was passed by the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, the American diplomatic community has been paying close attention. However, no one has expressed an opinion on how the overall situation will progress. The general opinion in political circles is that if Germany continues to refuse to return to Geneva and does not participate in the general convention on arms limitation and security guarantees, then Germany will bear the main responsibility if the Disarmament Conference fails. Although the views in political circles are like this, in fact, Germany's return to Geneva is regarded as having very little hope. There are even rumors that after the recent events in Geneva, the German government seems to have decided that it will never return to Geneva under any circumstances and has notified several governments of this intention. At present, because American officials are absolutely silent, it is impossible to determine whether the American government has indeed received this notification. Judging from the situation, this kind of news does not seem to have any reliable basis. (Ninth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guarantee of Equal Rights Depends on France's Promise</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The diplomatic and political commentary of a semi-official agency here believes that the recent reconciliation formula in Geneva is a manifestation of extreme fatigue, rather than the result of genuine consideration. "The so-called adjournment until October is tantamount to an indefinite adjournment, because the various committees have not been given the responsibility of drafting a disarmament convention." According to the newspaper's opinion, Italy's position among European countries is the most frank and clear, because Italy has refused to participate in this deceptive move. As for the hope that Germany can return to the Disarmament Conference, from Germany's point of view, substantial arms reduction is the best guarantee. Before Germany can rejoin the League of Nations, it must first obtain a solid guarantee that it can obtain the equal rights that it was solemnly promised in the past. However, this guarantee depends on France alone. (Ninth National News dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Discusses Disarmament - British Policy is Contradictory</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's newspaper Izvestia published an article by the famous Soviet political commentator Radek on disarmament. Radek stated, "Geneva has witnessed the collapse of many conferences, but today's issue is by no means comparable to just another failure among hundreds of conferences since the war. This matter has become the pivotal point of the political situation in the whole of Europe or even the world, because this political situation has reached a stage where Geneva has been able to become the crystallization point of the final preparations for war." Radek elaborated on the positions of Britain and France, stating, "Barthou and Simon's speeches at the Disarmament Conference have demonstrated to the world in a dramatic way that the development of European relations over the past fifteen years since the war has resulted in a complete divergence between the policies of the two leading imperialist countries in Europe." Radek continued, "German imperialism is indeed trying to return to the conference, while British imperialism is giving it the possibility of freely changing the situation in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. British imperialism is also giving Japanese imperialism the possibility of freely acting in northern and eastern Manchuria. British imperialism openly hints at the various forces that are preparing for imperialist wars, saying, 'If you follow this path, you will not encounter the obstruction of British imperialism.' Although Britain outwardly claims that it is willing to defend France, in reality it is only willing to defend France's territory in Europe. It is trying to undermine France's international position, and the reason why it is worried about France's territory in Europe is only because it deeply fears that once the French-German border changes, Belgium will also fall within the German sphere of influence. This situation is tantamount to having a pistol pointed at the heart of Britain."</p>
<p>British imperialism is also thinking like this: although it has weakened since the war, it can play the role that the United States played in the last World War, that is, it can maintain its neutral position to accumulate huge amounts of money, and then join the war and end it in order to demand large-scale profits. However, it is common knowledge that American imperialism has gained little by relying on this policy. Britain's estimates have failed to foresee the situation in parts of Europe and Asia, which is not difficult to demonstrate." (Ninth TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia's editorial, entitled "The Conspiracy of Geneva," stated, "The Soviet Union's firm defense of peace has aroused the concern of the most aggressive countries today. The British diplomatic government has mobilized all means to prevent peace from being formed with the Soviet Union's participation and its great influence. On the one hand, British foreign policy has begun to influence France, and on the other hand, it is trying to pull Germany back to the conference while making various concessions on the Saar plebiscite issue. Its mobilization of Sweden, Norway, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, and other countries to help itself has been successful, and the French government is also worried about being isolated from other capitalist powers, so it has made concessions in order to reach an understanding on the issue of prohibiting Germany from expanding its armaments. At the same time, it is seeking more guarantees from Britain that it will provide assistance in the event of a German invasion, or it is trying to prove to all wavering elements that the world is indeed threatened by German imperialism. The Soviet Union's actions to defend peace, the exposure of the war crisis shaking the world, and the Soviet Union's proposal to organize national defense for the invaded countries have all made countries witness the extremely serious war tendencies of today and the forces that support some powers. When these powers advance, they always conceal their flags and silence their drums, and try to place the responsibility for worsening international relations on the shoulders of others, so that they can cover up their own policies and make other countries tremble with fear at the 'danger' of the Soviet Union's growing strength.</p>
<p>If this retreat of those who promote war can delay the expansion of imperialism or the preparations for war even slightly, then this result can be attributed to the Soviet Union's firmness and proposals. On the contrary, if this kind of imperialist powers' conspiracy proves that the policies of those representing the expansionist tendencies have not changed at all, then even those who are still wavering today will believe that Litvinov's proposals in Geneva are the only way to enhance security.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union does not seek conflict with any country, nor does it seek to encircle any country, whether it is Germany or another country. The Soviet Union does not participate in diplomatic conspiracies, nor does it conclude alliances to antagonize other countries. The Soviet Union is fighting for peace and will continue this policy with unwavering spirit in the future, because this spirit is the characteristic of Soviet policy in various situations related to the life interests of all countries in the world."

<h3>Lithuanian Coup Linked to Germany; Aims to Disrupt Lithuanian-Polish Cooperation</h3>
<p>Warsaw: According to private sources in the Lithuanian capital, the coup that occurred in the country's capital on the 6th of this month is likely related to Germany. There is currently a movement within Lithuanian public opinion to encourage cooperation between Lithuania and Poland. (Note: The two countries have long been at odds over the sovereignty of Vilnius, which is currently occupied by Poland.) Germany wants to preemptively prevent this movement from succeeding. When the coup broke out, German residents in the Memel region were reportedly very excited, while Lithuanian people in the area were shocked by the crisis. Lithuanian President Smetona has been striving to maintain a neutral position between Poland and Germany. Political figures here say that the German press seemed to have prior knowledge of the events in Lithuania, as they published a report on May 31st highlighting the dangerous situation of German people in the Memel region.

<h3>Austrian Terrorist Party Creates Havoc; Multiple Bombings Across the Country; Internal Security Leader Narrowly Escapes Death</h3>
<p>Vienna: In addition to the near-miss incident involving the express train between Paris and Vienna this morning, internal security guards in the Lueg Pass were attacked by gunfire from the mountainside, resulting in one death and one serious injury. Furthermore, reports of terrorist sabotage have emerged from various locations across the country. The suspension bridge guarding Semmering has been bombed, causing Italian trains to be halted en route. The railway line in the Krens area has also been bombed, likely with the intention of disrupting the diplomatic corps' government-sponsored tour. The pier at the Danube's Moosdorf wharf was also bombed this morning. Multiple other bombings have also occurred. A craftsman repairing the office of Internal Security Leader Prince Starhemberg discovered a powerful bomb in a desk drawer today. The fuse was connected to a clock, timed to detonate when the Prince entered the office. Fortunately, it was discovered in time, otherwise the Prince would have been in grave danger.

<p>Vienna: The General Staff of the National Socialist Party in the German monastic city has been undertaking terrorist activities against Austria, launching an offensive at the beginning of this month. Consequently, incidents have repeatedly occurred throughout Austria. Some terrorists have been captured and will be tried by a military tribunal.

Recently, authorities found letters in the home of terrorist Blanc, proving that the National Socialists in the monastic city were primarily responsible for planning destructive acts within Austria. Dollfuss has collected various pieces of evidence, compiling a dossier that will be submitted to the League of Nations if necessary. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>German Central Bank Suspends Trade Payments; Reduced Currency Reserves Lead to Difficult Situation</h3>

<h3>Chaotic Political Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The interim report by Justice Minister Oyama on a certain incident, which will determine the fate of the cabinet, is making slow progress due to judicial review. It is doubtful whether it can be completed around the 15th. It is also questionable whether the content of the report will be sufficient to decide whether Finance Minister Takahashi should resign. Therefore, the government, concerned about the instability of the political situation, is criticizing Justice Minister Oyama's attitude as too rash. If the Finance Minister's case is approved for preliminary examination, Justice Minister Oyama will be in an extremely difficult position. Therefore, Justice Minister Oyama's future attitude is particularly noteworthy. (Dentsu, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Various rumors are circulating about the future of the political situation, such as the Emperor issuing another mandate for Ugaki to succeed the cabinet. People's observations differ, making it difficult to obtain accurate information. The Seiyukai party's observations are as follows:</p>
<p>Finance Minister Takahashi has indeed expressed his intention to resign to Prime Minister Saito, stating that he should take responsibility for the Ministry of Finance's issues. However, Takahashi said that the current cabinet does not need to resign en masse. Interior Minister Yamamoto also holds the same opinion. However, Prime Minister Saito believes that if Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, the cabinet will have to resign en masse, so he is doing his best to persuade the Finance Minister to stay. If the Finance Minister insists on resigning, then the only option is to implement a total resignation. However, Prime Minister Saito has a special relationship with senior officials in the Imperial Court, so the future is unpredictable. If another mandate is issued, how the cabinet will be rebuilt is a question. At that time, the Suzuki faction of the Seiyukai will certainly not support it. However, the Tokonami-Mochizuki faction, which opposes Suzuki, may agree to join the cabinet, using the emerging power of cooperation between the Seiyukai and the Minseito to deal with the next parliament. Another observation is that the current cabinet will have Interior Minister Yamamoto transferred to Finance Minister, and Tokonami appointed as Interior Minister. This is also a possible solution. However, all observations are in their own favor. The president's faction certainly hopes that Suzuki will join the cabinet, but there is no certainty about the actual situation. Also, if the Ugaki or Kiyoura cabinet appears, there is fear that internal conflicts will arise within the party. Although Hatoyama and others have visited various elder statesmen to request understanding, the root of internal conflict is deep, so the future is extremely uncertain. (Dentsu, 10th)</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies to Implement Industrialization Policy; Prospects for Dutch-Japanese Talks Become Clear</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Japanese Consul-General in Batavia, Koshida, on the 9th, the Dutch Aneta News Agency reported the following: "The Dutch government instructed the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies that, in order to protect and promote various industries in the Dutch East Indies, import duties should be waived for raw materials and machinery. In accordance with this principle, a bill to amend the Dutch East Indies Customs Tariff Law has been submitted to the parliament." As this amendment bill urgently needs to be implemented, it will be implemented without consulting the Senate. Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming Dutch-Japanese talks in Batavia, the Dutch side will inevitably implement industrial protection policies and establish the industrialization of the Dutch East Indies colony. This has already shown their determination. Therefore, this matter is a major issue that deserves the utmost attention regarding the future of Dutch-Japanese talks. (Rengo, 10th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Asks Congress to Allocate Funds for Drought Relief</h3>

There is no concern about food shortages for the people, but in a very large area, there will be a shortage of feed for livestock. The message outlines the procedures for providing relief to farmers in the affected areas, including providing working capital, purchasing livestock, lending money to farmers who are unable to purchase new farmland, and relocating drought victims to newly developed farmland.

It is also heard that Argentina has reserved a large amount of overseas shipping space and has sold a large amount of forward wheat. Argentina is now demanding that its limit for next year should account for one-third of global sales, while the current limit is one-fifth of the total. A compromise has been proposed at the wheat conference being held here, but Argentina has not yet received its government's reply to this proposal. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Prepares to Form Committee to Streamline Local Taxes; Supervisory Committees in Various Provinces and Cities Are Implementing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government has made the utmost determination to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes. The Financial Conference has decided that various provinces and cities should abolish them one by one by the end of this year. A Local Tax Streamlining Committee will be established in the Ministry of Finance to investigate the tax situation in various provinces and cities and propose compensation measures. Minister of Finance Kong has now appointed experts Chen Duan, Guan Jiyu, and Zhang Miao as committee members to actively prepare. The Director of the Taxation Department will serve as the Chief Secretary. Regarding the Tax Supervisory Committees that the Financial Conference has decided various provinces and cities should establish, the local financial authorities, after returning to their posts, have telegraphed the ministry to indicate that they are implementing the plan. It is expected that the people of various regions will be able to reduce countless excessive and miscellaneous burdens next year. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Bureau is Underway in the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance has decided to reorganize the Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Bureau by the end of this month, as the current year will soon begin, in order to implement the sale of stamps through post offices in various regions starting this year. They are currently consulting with the Ministry of Communications and the postal authorities on the procedures. It is heard that they will allocate about one-tenth of the stamp revenue as a handling fee for the post offices. Once Postmaster General Guo Xinsong drafts detailed measures, it can be implemented. Since the stamp portion of the stamp, tobacco, and alcohol bureaus in various provinces is only for accounting management, and the tobacco and alcohol licenses are allocated to local governments as government revenue, the remaining affairs are relatively simple. They have decided to reduce redundant personnel to save expenses. The ministry is drafting an organizational law, which will be announced soon. At the same time, many of the directors of the provincial bureaus will also be transferred. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Hosts Cantonese and Hong Kong Press Delegation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin hosted a banquet for the Cantonese and Hong Kong press delegation at 4:00 PM on the 10th, inviting military and political officials to accompany them. He Yingqin said in his speech, "I have been ordered to come north and it has been over a year. Thanks to the assistance of all parties, everything has proceeded smoothly. I can now report to you on a few points. First, today last year, all the troops in North China had complex units and disorganized systems. After the reorganization and disbandment by the Military Council, about 500 old and weak personnel were dismissed and more than 60,000 personnel were disbanded. The existing troops are now under a unified system and are being earnestly trained. In the future, hundreds of thousands of troops in North China are expected to become good national troops. Second, the revenue and expenditure of military expenses in North China have not been suitable. Since January 1st of this year, salaries have been paid on a monthly basis according to the new budget, without any discrimination. Since its implementation, the lives of officers and soldiers have been very stable. Third, the finances of North China were previously allocated and transferred by various military organs. Since the Military Council determined the new method, all military expenditures are allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, all tax revenues are completely returned to the Ministry of Finance for unified distribution. This matter is of great importance to national unification. If the whole country can do this, why worry that the country cannot be unified? Fourth, after the ceasefire in North China, banditry was rampant in the war zone. After the Military Council strictly ordered the garrison to suppress them, they have gradually been pacified. In general, the situation in North China and Central China is becoming more stable. All political orders are being implemented, and troop movements are all subject to the Central Government. The general public also deeply feels that only by supporting the Central Government to complete unification can the country and nation be revived. I have been away from southern China for a long time and deeply miss Guangdong, the source of the revolution. I hope that you, who have come from afar to investigate, will convey the situation to our comrades in southern China. Everyone must eliminate all right and wrong, emotions, and prejudices, and not listen to the rumors spread by treacherous people. We must unite sincerely, complete true unification, work hard, and jointly overcome the current serious national crisis, and strive for the revival of the country and the nation. This is my sincere request, and I believe you will be happy to adopt it." After He Yingqin finished his speech, Song Zheyuan reported on the recent situation in Chahar Province, and Shang Zhen spoke about the determination of the military leaders of North China to unite sincerely, support unification, and work hard. Finally, Hu Zhiwu, on behalf of the delegation, delivered a reply. The gathering ended happily at around 6:00 PM. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Jilin Volunteer Army Fiercely Battles Japanese and Puppet Troops, Various Units Unite and Grow Stronger</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The eastern and northern parts of Jilin Province, with their treacherous terrain, are the best areas for volunteer army activities. Since the failure of the resistance against Japan by the units of Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Wang Delin, and others, their former subordinates have gathered there. Recently, Xie Wendong, Zhou Yasan, and others have risen in revolt after sacrificing their homes, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese and puppet troops. Therefore, they have all risen up and are active, and their strength has spread to several counties. In addition to Binxian, which has long been occupied, they recently captured Muling and are also besieging Dongning and Zhuhe. Now, all the units have established contact and are echoing each other from afar. The following is a record of their recent activities:</p>
<h3>Capture of Muling</h3>
<p>Over 500 men from the Ninth Battalion of the Jilin Eastern Volunteer Army captured Muling on the 22nd of last month, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers and dozens of puppet soldiers. They seized a large number of guns and ammunition and disarmed a puppet police guard of about 50 men in the city. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese and puppet troops immediately dispatched a large force to attack. The volunteer army, fearing damage to merchants and civilians, retreated to the Baicaogou area north of the city and engaged in guerrilla warfare with the Japanese and puppet troops.</p>
<h3>Siege of Dongning</h3>
<p>Kong Xianrong, a subordinate of Wang Delin's army, has been actively working to contact former subordinates, gathering more than 10,000 men in areas such as Badaohezi and Shahezi in Dongning County and advancing on the county seat. The Japanese and puppet troops have closed the city gates and are defending tightly, in great fear. The county seat may fall at any moment.</p>
<h3>Approaching Harbin</h3>
<p>The units of Zhao Shangzhi, Jiujiang, and others, after occupying Binxian, divided into two routes: one advancing towards Qiuhe, already besieging the county seat, and the other approaching places such as Xindian and Jiabanzhan, which belong to Binxian. They have now advanced to a place more than ten miles away from Xindian. Two puppet warships are stationed in the area, coordinating with the Japanese and puppet troops and police to maintain strict precautions, not daring to cross the line, and the situation is quite dangerous.</p>
<h3>Sino-Tibetan Agreement Signed: Both Sides' Troops Withdraw to the Rear; Land of Dagye Monastery is Fully Returned</h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Kang-Tibet conflict, which began in 1920, has lasted for five years. Its origin lies in the occupation of the Dagye Monastery in Garze, Xikang, by Kang troops, and the resulting exile of the monks in the monastery. The two sides have repeatedly engaged in conflict, sometimes flaring up and sometimes subsiding. The central government, mindful of the western frontier, has repeatedly ordered a ceasefire and awaited a resolution. It is now learned that on the 17th of last month, the Chinese and Tibetan sides signed an agreement. Liu Wenhui, commander of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense, has submitted the full text of the agreement to the central government and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. This concludes the years-long dispute once and for all. The following is a transcript of Liu's report: (Omissions) I respectfully acknowledge that, regarding the case of resettling the Dagye monks and people, I, Hui, have followed the strategy given by the March imperial order and sent personnel to discuss the matter back and forth with the Tibetan side. On the date of this month, the Sino-Tibetan agreement was signed, with the method of settling the Dagye monks and people consisting of twelve articles. The text reads: (1) The conditions proposed by Sichuan last year, agreeing to Sino-Tibetan harmony as one family, have already been agreed upon. However, the resettlement of Dagye has not yet been completed. Therefore, both sides agree on the method of resettlement as follows: (2) Before the resettlement of Dagye, both sides misunderstood the troops mobilized. From May 17th to June 6th, both sides will send personnel to monitor and withdraw to the rear on the same day. The number of troops to be stationed at the front should be handled according to the previous conditions agreed upon at Gangtuo. (3) The Dagye Monastery should appoint a Khenpo. Two virtuous and reputable people from the monastery should be nominated by the monastery, one as Khenpo and one as an assistant. After obtaining the approval of the Chinese side, they will be appointed by the Dalai Lama, and the Chinese side will add a certificate of appointment. However, they will only manage the monastery's religious affairs and will not interfere in administrative or other matters. (4) The Dagye Monastery itself will be repaired under the supervision of personnel sent by the Chinese and Tibetan governments. (5) All land belonging to the Dagye Monastery will be returned for free cultivation, and taxes will be paid according to the acreage. Ula obligations will be fulfilled in accordance with regulations. (6) The Dagye Monastery is the same as all the other lama monasteries in Tibet, and the Yellow Hat sect's rules are hereby established. The Xikang government will treat the monastery the same as the monasteries in Kangding, with equal treatment and the same jurisdiction. (7) After the Dagye monks and people return, they will still be Kang residents. The government will not hold them accountable for past actions and will allow them to reform themselves, abide by the law, and receive the same treatment as the Kang residents. However, they must not violate the law, otherwise they will still be punished according to the law. (8) The Dagye people own firearms. Except for those handed over to the government, they are specially allowed to keep 90 guns, which will be coded and registered by the government and issued permits. If they are carried outside, they must be reported to the local officials for approval before they can be carried. (9) The Dagye people should sign a pledge with the government to never cause trouble. All past grievances with the monastery will be explained by the government, and each party will sign a pledge not to seek revenge, which will be kept on file to end disputes and eliminate hidden dangers. (10) After the resettlement of the Dagye people, all matters requiring consultation between the Chinese and Tibetan sides will still be resolved by the central government and the Dalai Lama according to the conditions agreed upon at Gangtuo. (11) The government will file this method and put it into practice. (12) If there are any doubts about this method, the Chinese text will prevail. Jiang Yuwen, the county magistrate of Dege, was sent by the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Headquarters to negotiate the settlement, and Jueji Xiangrang, a representative of the three major monasteries of the Tibetan government, was sent by the Dalai Lama. The Chinese translator was Huang Jihua, and the Tibetan translator was Yin Wenku. They were ordered in the middle of this month at Aida Wang Yanbi. I respectfully report this to you, hoping that you will investigate. Liu Wenhui, commander of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense, respectfully reports.</p>
<h3>Rampant Bandits in Zhangzhou: Wu Ci Claims to be the Southern China Army, Occupying the Area Between Longxi, Huaan and Changtai; The Headquarters Orders the Three Counties to Jointly Suppress Them</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The bandits in Zhangzhou, led by Wu Ci, have repeatedly surrendered and rebelled. Before 1931, Zhang Zhen, commander of the former 49th Division, accepted their surrender and incorporated them into a guerrilla force. Later, because his troops were still lawless and reckless, they were disbanded, and Wu also claimed to have retired to his hometown. In fact, his troops were still scattered around Haicheng, Longxi, and Huaan. Wu himself has close ties with Taiwanese people, and many famous Taiwanese people in Xiamen are his close friends. Therefore, his so-called retirement meant going to Taiwan. After the naval forces recovered Xiamen during the Fujian Rebellion, Du Qiyun, as a special military commissioner in Xiamen, widely recruited local militias. Wu was also appointed as the commander of the Third Detachment, establishing his headquarters in Xiamen, and gathering four or five hundred of his men in Haicheng. At that time, many of Wu's officers were Taiwanese. When Wu's troops became increasingly rampant in Haicheng, and their power expanded, it was clear that they had some kind of background. Du Qiyun was then detained and executed due to some relationship. Wu was ordered by the headquarters to be suppressed, and Wu immediately led his troops to Huaan, openly raising the banner of the Southern China Army. Most recently, Wu's troops have gathered about a thousand men. Because the Central Army and the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 3rd Security Regiments were stationed in the three counties of Huaan, Ningyang and Zhangping, Wu's troops fled south. Now his troops are distributed in the southern part of Huaan, the northern countryside of Longxi, and the third district of Changtai, which is the intersection of the three counties. Wu himself is in Kuzhu, but his troops are not gathered together. According to investigations, his henchman Song Jianghe leads dozens of people stationed in Chaoyingshe, collecting boat fees and timber raft taxes, and looting luggage in the Tannei, Longyankeng and Tankou areas. Sixty or seventy people are stationed in Tainei, led by Taiwanese Huang Peihua. Dai Mumu and Zhang Wan each have forty or more men stationed in Wanheshe. Chen Bingding, Yang Jun, and Chen Qian each have dozens of people stationed in Shangxia Zhang. Guo An and Yu Daben have more than a hundred men in Shangping. Tong Guoying has three hundred men in Mianzhitoukeng, with 240 guns. Together with other places, there are about a thousand men, but each place only has dozens or hundreds of men. The largest group is Tong Guoying with about three hundred men. Taiwanese participate in each group. Many of Wu's cadres are Taiwanese. The source of guns and ammunition is the Taiwanese who manage to supply them from Xiamen, with a boatman named Zhang taking responsibility for transportation along the Beixi waterway. Zhang has received 60 guns from Wu and is rampaging on the water. Wu's residence in Kuzhu is also equipped with a military telephone, which can communicate with Banxingxu and Zhengdashe in his occupied area. There is also a branch line to Tainei. Wu's troops are scattered in various villages, each group is small in number, but they all raise the banner of "Southern China Army, a certain division." The ones already discovered have the words "Third Division" on them. The above situation has been verified by the Eastern Route Headquarters. There is indeed a background. It has now been decided to dispatch a certain regiment stationed in Huaan and the Security Regiment to jointly suppress them from the three counties of Huaan, Nanjing and Longxi. Wu's troops are nothing but a rabble. In reality, there are only about a thousand scattered bandits, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out quickly. (8th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province: Measures to Blockade Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Dividing into full bandit areas, half-bandit areas, and neighboring bandit areas.</p>
<p>Strictly restricting salt sales in Longyan and Huaan.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The bandit suppression army in northern and western Fujian has recently implemented a blockade policy. The implementation plan has been revised and completed by the provincial government meeting last week, and passed for implementation. There are four steps: (1) dividing areas, (2) organizing agencies, (3) following regulations, and (4) inspecting and correcting. Except for safe areas, all areas will be effectively blockaded. All areas that have not been designated as full bandit areas, half-bandit areas, or neighboring bandit areas are designated as safe counties. Salt merchants in safe counties must apply to the county government for a passport to purchase and transport salt. Those who have not obtained a passport are not allowed to purchase and transport salt from outside. The governments of safe counties should investigate and clarify the total population and the amount of salt needed in the county. When salt merchants apply for passports, they must fill out the applications in batches according to the total amount of salt needed by the population in each county, and must not exceed this amount. They must also submit monthly reports for verification. In order to understand the implementation and communication status of the blockade agencies, the military authorities stipulate that a blockade meeting should be convened once a week, and the rules and regulations should be drafted in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Nanchang Headquarters. All goods transported within the blockade area, or goods transported from safe counties to neighboring bandit areas and half-bandit areas, must apply for a certificate of license. In areas where a blockade management office has been established, the management office is responsible. In areas where a management office has not been established, the consultation will be responsible for issuing the certificate. Merchants in neighboring bandit areas who transport goods from place A to place B, weighing more than 50 catties, should indicate the route and arrival date on the certificate, and bring back a receipt from place B to place A, and submit it to the blockade agency for record. The salt tax surcharge in each county should be abolished immediately before the public sale. Other ways to compensate must be found. After the public sale, absolutely no arbitrary donations are allowed. Violators will be severely punished upon discovery.</p>
<p>Longyan has established a blockade bandit area management office and a salt and kerosene public sales bureau. Currently, the salt business is temporarily contracted by the Longyan Merchants Association, under official supervision and commercial sales. According to the population of Longyan and the needs of the surrounding areas, salt is transported daily from Zhangzhou by car. The governments of Huaan, Zhangping, and Ningyang are managed by the Huaan County Government, which distributes it according to population, with a fixed monthly quota per person. The purchase must be approved and stamped by the Huaan County Government, so that the county magistrate is responsible, to show caution and to prevent secret connections with bandits. (June 8th)</p>

<h3>Internal Disintegration of Sichuan Bandits</h3>
<p>丨A Unit of the Pseudo 27th Division Secretly Plots Defection丨</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Regarding the Sichuan bandit suppression military affairs, after the fourth bandit suppression conference, the authorities, in order to make full preparations, decided to directly attack Tongjiang from Bazhong and Jiangkou, in order to eliminate the bandit atmosphere as soon as possible. However, the Communist bandits are deeply afraid of the defection of the Red Guards and guerrillas and are using intimidation and killing tactics. Now, most of the new weapons of the guerrillas have been taken away, leaving only wooden guns and other items. (2) There is a shortage of salt, and they are mostly trying to buy it from our side. Food and supplies have long been transported to Dehancheng, Changping, and Shaxizui. Tongjiang is an empty city. The bandit leaders Xu, Zhang, and Chen are now operating in Wangping Mansion, between Wenxikou and Shaxizui, about a hundred miles along the eastern road to Tongjiang, in great secrecy. The armory in Dengjiayan and the eastern Jianzhai outside Tongcheng, and the copper coin factory west of the city, are also located in that area and Dehancheng. (3) It is rumored that the bandits transported several hundred thousand silver dollars to the Shaanxi border, attempting to find a way to buy passage. A battalion of soldiers was sent to escort them, but they were disarmed by Yang De of Shaanxi, and they are fighting in Zhenba County. (4) The bandits have increased troops on the front lines of the first and second routes, which is of a defensive nature and does not have any attacking power. (5) Recently, the soldiers from Yilong and Yingshan in the bandit army, because most of them were forced to become bandits in the past, and now both counties have been recovered by the government army, and the government has sent teams to publicize, are eager to defect. However, because the bandit party is strictly monitoring them, it is not easy to take action. Therefore, at dawn on May 23rd, they agreed to meet secretly at a place three miles behind Sha Niu Ping. However, there was an internal traitor who secretly reported to the headquarters of the Pseudo 27th Division. After receiving the information, the bandit division headquarters immediately sent a team to seize more than a hundred people who were planning to defect, with seventy or eighty guns. (Because they were all incorporated into the official bandit army, they had guns.) Those who were planning to defect, knowing that their plan had been exposed, would face certain death. Therefore, they rose up in resistance. By 3 p.m., the bandits from the bandit division headquarters had suffered more than 60 casualties, but those planning to defect were ultimately outnumbered and ran out of ammunition, and were disarmed. The pseudo-division headquarters moved from Ma'anping to Wang Wenhuai's house on the top of Sha Niu Ping Mountain on the 22nd. About sixty or seventy sick bandits from each regiment of the division were all transported to the Wangping General Hospital on the 23rd. The pseudo-division commander was also sent to Wangping on the same day due to serious illness. Xu Bandit also dispatched a pseudo-special agent battalion from Tongjiang Gezui Baihe to Shaniu Ping to monitor the troops of the Pseudo 27th Division. From this, it can be seen that the internal panic and division of the bandits are becoming increasingly apparent and acute, and the day of their complete annihilation is not far off.

<h3>Yiyong Brigade of Ling County Killed Bandit Leader Cai Huiwen</h3>
<p>Also killed several important bandits.</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the various armies of the Red Bandits were reorganized according to the new system the year before last, the Xianggan and Xiangegan bandit armies were reorganized into the Sixth Army Group of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The original Eighth Red Army was reorganized into the 17th Division of the Sixth Army Group, with the original army commander Xiao Ke as the division commander, and the commander-in-chief and political commissar as Cai Huiwen. The military region was divided into four districts: Lianhua, Chaling, You County, and Pingxiang County were the first district, Ling County, Ninggang, and Suichuan County were the second district, Fenyi and Xinxia County were the third district, and the original Suiwantai Temporary Command was reorganized into the fourth district command. Each district had a commander and political commissar. Yongxin, Ji'an, and Anfu County were directly under the jurisdiction of the pseudo-military region and were directly commanded by the pseudo-commander-in-chief Cai Huiwen. As for the strength of the Xianggan Military Region, there was Xiao Ke's pseudo-17th Division, which included the 49th, 50th, and 51st Regiments, each regiment with three battalions, each battalion with four companies, and each company with seven short guns and ninety-two Mauser rifles. The entire division had about 5,000 guns in total. In addition, each district had three independent regiments, one guard regiment, and independent battalions from nine counties: Chaling, Lianhua, Anfu, Ninggang, Ji'an, Ling County, Suichuan, southern Jiangxi, Wantai, etc. In total, the pseudo-military region had about 10,000 guns, with twice as many people. The area under its jurisdiction was as wide as 13 counties. At that time, the strength of the bandit forces was truly shocking. Since the government army joined forces to encircle and suppress them in recent years, the bandit flames have gradually died down. Except for Xiao Ke's bandit troops still entrenched on the border between Yongxin and Lianhua, the rest have been broken up into smaller units and are fleeing everywhere. The pseudo-commander-in-chief Cai Huiwen has become powerless, and his command has become ineffective. It is heard that this time, Cai Bandit only led dozens of bandits with guns, fleeing from Ling County to Suichuan. On the way, they encountered the Yiyong Brigade of Ling County, who had already killed Cai Bandit. Yesterday, Duan Heng, the brigade commander of the 19th Division, and Wan Fangzhou, the county magistrate of Ling County, both sent telegrams to the province. Brigade Commander Duan telegraphed, "According to Li Jinjian, commander of the Ling County Yiyong Joint Brigade, I led my troops to suppress the bandits in the areas of Xinchen, Li Bi Ling, Niulan Shuan, and Shanwei. We encountered and engaged about a hundred bandits with five or sixty guns. After two hours of fierce fighting, we killed five bandits on the spot, including the pseudo-commander-in-chief Cai Huiwen, Lu Xianming, deputy commander of the 2nd Company of the Independent Regiment of the Pseudo-Xianggan Military Region Command, Tan Wenxiang, a student of the Infantry Battalion of the Pseudo-Red Army Fourth Branch School, and two others whose names are unknown. We wounded more than 20 bandits and seized two rifles, one hand grenade, one wooden-handled grenade, one steel-cased grenade, one Mauser pistol, and one saber, and rescued four hostages including Zhang Zhanyuan," etc. County Magistrate Wan of Ling County telegraphed on the 30th, "According to Liao Yushan, the district director of the 2nd District and commander of the Yiyong Detachment, it has been reported that more than a hundred bandits with five or sixty guns have been disrupting the areas of Li Bi Ling, Niulan Shuan, and Shanwei. The situation is very fierce. I immediately ordered the various teams to go to encircle and suppress the bandits. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled to the border of Suichuan in a panic. In this battle, more than 20 bandits were wounded or killed, including three important bandit leaders. One was the pseudo-commander-in-chief Cai Huiwen, one was Tan Wenxiang, a student of the Infantry Battalion of the Pseudo-Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Fourth Branch School, and Wang Yuanheng was the secretary of the Independent Fourth Regiment of the Pseudo-Xianggan Military Region. The symbols found on the bodies of these bandits confirm that they were important bandits. We seized two rifles, three hand grenades, several sabers, and rescued four hostages including Zhang Zhanyuan (all from Suichuan). In addition to ordering a thorough search and suppression of the scattered bandits to clean up the area, I respectfully report this to you."</p>
<h3>Drafted by the Industry and Commerce Society: Measures to Improve the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>Submitted separately to the Qingdao and Jinan Authorities for Urging Implementation</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Shandong's coastal fishing industry is declining due to the adherence to old methods and lack of improvement by the Chinese people. This has given the Japanese an opportunity to encroach upon our country's fishing grounds, which is regrettable. The Qingdao Industry and Commerce Society, in order to improve fishing methods and develop the fishing industry, specially invited Mr. Zeng Shengzhi, the head of the society's fishing group, to convene with local fishing experts such as Ye Yujie, to discuss improvement measures. Opinions were drafted and submitted separately to the Qingdao and Jinan authorities as a reference for fisheries administration, and to urge fishermen to implement improvements. The measures are as follows: (1) Steamship Fishing: (A) Training Personnel: Examining Japanese fishing steamships, one-third of the drivers are graduates of fisheries schools, while Chinese fishing vessels are not. They all employ fishermen without scientific knowledge. There are few if any fisheries school graduates. How can uneducated fishermen compete with trained experts and win in the maritime production industry? This is why our country's fishing industry is declining day by day. (B) It is appropriate to promote fisheries cooperation. The equipment and supplies required for Chinese fishing vessels are more expensive than those for Japanese fishing vessels. For example, diesel fuel costs only 45 yuan per ton in Dalian, while in our country, diesel fuel is monopolized by merchants, and the price is doubled (purchasing diesel fuel in Qingdao costs more than 95 yuan per ton). Moreover, other fishing gear is more expensive when purchased piecemeal for each fishing vessel than in bulk. The government should find ways to make diesel fuel affordable and urge fishermen to implement cooperative ventures to reduce the burden on fishermen. (C) The equipment of fishing vessels should be expanded. Examining Chinese fishing vessels, they can only carry 50 tons, and the required horsepower is from 50 to 90, averaging 70 horsepower. Japanese fishing vessels can carry 100 tons and require 71 to 200 horsepower, and the hull is made of iron, fitted with radio and refrigerated ships, etc., so it is convenient for navigation and fishing. Looking back at our country's dilapidated fishing vessels, the superiority or inferiority is greatly different, and it is urgent to improve them. (2) Sailing Ship Fishing: (A) Dividing Fishing Grounds: In various coastal ports in our country, there are small steamships that sail at night. Fishermen cast nets in the sea without a fixed area, and they are often carried away by steamships. Steamships feel inconvenienced, and fishing nets are the fishermen's livelihood, which is very important. It has been heard many times that fishermen have lost their livelihoods due to losing their fishing nets. The government authorities should urgently survey the fishing grounds, divide the boundaries, make maps, distribute them to fishermen, and clearly indicate where nets can be cast and where the steamship routes are. A red flag should be painted on the net bridge and a signal light should be hung at night as a sign, which is convenient for both parties. (B) Cracking Down on Usury: Fishermen in our country are generally extremely poor. They rely on fishing for a living in the spring and summer. In the autumn and winter, it is cold and fish are scarce. They often borrow money from wealthy households, and the interest rate is generally 40%. They are digging flesh to heal sores, and their livelihoods are difficult. The government authorities must find ways to provide relief, crack down on usury, and guide fishermen to engage in side businesses to increase their income (June 9)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank Expands Warehouse Storage and Pledging; Last Year's Warehouses Numbered 95; This Year's Plans Are to Double That Number; Pledge Funds of Three Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: In recent years, the rural economy has been extremely depressed. All parties are paying attention to the establishment of agricultural warehouses to store and pledge agricultural products. The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has been operating for five years, paying close attention to the storage and pledge business on weekdays, and has made considerable progress. After wheat and soybeans are harvested this year, prices will inevitably decline naturally. Therefore, warehouse storage and pledging is imperative. The following is a record of the bank's handling of warehouse storage and pledging.</p>
<p>Warehouse Situation: The bank is the only regulatory body for the rural economy in Jiangsu Province. Since its establishment, in addition to lending money to farmers for the necessary funds for production, it has also focused on the operation of agricultural warehouses and storage pledges, hoping to activate the entire rural finance of Jiangsu Province through this. Therefore, promoting warehouse storage and pledging is an important policy of the bank. At present, the bank has 38 self-operated warehouses, 32 warehouses entrusted to local agencies, and 25 warehouses operated by cooperative societies or farmers' education halls, distributed in more than 20 counties with abundant agricultural products such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Danyang, Jiangyin, Wujiang, Qingpu, Xuzhou, Yancheng, and Rugao, specializing in the storage and pledging of agricultural products near each county, in order to regulate agricultural product prices and benefit the turnover of rural finance.</p>
<p>Pledge Quantity: The bank has a total of 95 self-operated and entrusted storage warehouses. The quantity of various agricultural products pledged this year has reached more than 500,430 dan, and the total pledged value is more than 1,281,700 yuan. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and financial turnover is sluggish, this huge amount of funds is dispersed in rural areas of various counties. Although it cannot restore the rural economy to prosperity at once, the financial activities and turnover in rural areas are indeed far better than in the past.</p>
<p>Pledge Types: The main products of rural areas are rice, grain, beans, wheat, miscellaneous grains, silk, cotton, soybean cake, etc. Jiangsu Province is located on the coast of the East China Sea, with the Yangtze River running through the central part, and the Grand Canal running north and south. Its water conservancy is far superior to other provinces, so these kinds of products are particularly abundant. However, due to the drastic drop in prices, rural areas are becoming increasingly bankrupt. The bank is making every effort to store and pledge agricultural products in various counties under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, such as rice, grain, beans, wheat, raw silk, soybean cake, and cotton. According to statistics, the agricultural products currently stored in the bank's self-operated and entrusted warehouses are mostly rice and grain, followed by beans, wheat, soybean cake, cotton, and raw silk. The pledge quantity this year is estimated at about 250,000 shi of rice and grain, about 30,000 shi of wheat, about 30,000 shi of beans, about 20,000 dan of cotton, about 100,000 pieces of soybean cake, more than 20,000 shi of miscellaneous grains, about 1,500 dan of fertilizer powder, and about 30,000 bolts of cloth.</p>
<p>Expansion Plan: It is reported that in addition to expanding the existing warehouses in various counties, the bank has now decided to continue to add new ones and strive to promote them, and plans to manage the pledge affairs on behalf of the agricultural warehouse management committees of various counties. It is estimated that 2 million dan of rice and other grains will be pledged this year, with 3 million yuan as pledge funds. In terms of alleviating the entire rural economy, its effect may not be very significant, but it should be much more effective than last year.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Opening of the National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition organized by the county party headquarters, the county chamber of commerce, the people's education hall and other groups is located in the county chamber of commerce. After repeated preparations, it has been completed and the opening ceremony was held at 9:00 am today (the 10th). After the chairman of the party committee, Wang Zhewu, reported, Yang Zhimin, the standing committee member of the chamber of commerce, Lang Xianlong, the representative of the party headquarters, and Xu Lixing, the representative of the people's education hall, gave speeches successively. The meeting adjourned after the ceremony. More than 30 businesses in the city, including silk fabrics, hardware, foreign goods, porcelain, cigarettes, sweets, stationery fans, soda, cotton textiles, rattan ware hats, and galoshes, have set up shop in the various rooms of the hall. The goods are dazzling. Many people visit and watch. All goods are sold at reduced prices, so buyers are quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Rental Boycott</h3>
<p>Since the demolition of the Pingqiao Bridge in Songcheng, it has been convenient to travel by rickshaw. Last year, rickshaw pullers went on strike for a while because of the high rental prices and demanded a price reduction. After the rickshaw companies accepted, the rental price was reduced to thirty cents, and they immediately resumed work. Almost a year has passed, and suddenly at about 11:00 am today (the 10th), the rickshaw pullers withdrew their rentals one after another, surging in like a tide. However, the reasons for the withdrawal were not stated. The rickshaw companies saw the rickshaw pullers on the road, forcing the rickshaw pullers to withdraw their rentals and preventing them from doing business, fearing that it would cause trouble, and reported to the Public Security Bureau for suppression. After receiving the report, Director Zhou Dingjiu personally went to the Malu Bridge, where the rickshaw pullers were gathering, and earnestly guided them, instructing them to elect representatives to negotiate. No one responded. Everyone said that this strike was uncoordinated and that everyone was following blindly. The instigators are being investigated in order to negotiate a solution.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Village Bandit Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Rang Zheng, Lu Xirong, the main criminal in the kidnapping case in the northeastern village, had already been shot. The remaining criminals have also been sentenced by the county government as follows: Chen Ahe, i.e., Xiao Yehu, was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and extortion. Yao Qingyun (i.e., Yao Qingrong), Xu Alan, Zhang Hongsheng, and Zhang Axiao were each sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for jointly kidnapping and extorting. Xu Xilin was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for jointly intending to illegally possess property and threatening others to hand over property. Wang Aer was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Achievements of the Temple Nunnery Silkworm Farming Cooperative</h3>
<p>The silkworm farming cooperative attached to the Temple Nunnery Agricultural Education Hall in the 11th People's Education District of Wuxi, and the Xinpu Lane Ruan Gengshang branch, have achieved good results in silkworm farming over the years. This spring, the number of people joining the cooperative has increased even more sharply. Silkworm farmers (cooperative members) have a total of 325 households raising 80 liang of silkworm ants, and 500 zhang and 225 households have been assisted in hatching. The instructor of the cooperative is dispatched by the Huaxin Silk Weaving Training Institute, so Tian Shifen, Hong Xiuzhi, and Chen Zhiyu have been specially hired as directors, and Sun Shiqin, Sun Baojun, Qin Pingyu, and Zhao Wenjie are staff members. The instructors guide the silkworm farmers and do their best, and the staff of the hall can also assist to the best of their ability, resulting in very good results, so the farmers in the villages are all happy. The silk cocoons have now been spun, and an investigation into the yield of fresh cocoons shows that each qian of silkworm ants can produce an average of 30 jin of cocoons, for a total of more than 390 dan. It is estimated that more than 18,000 yuan will be distributed in rural areas. The instructors have completed their official duties and chartered a boat back to the city yesterday. When they left, the silkworm farmers went to the port to see them off.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Shops Stop Weighing, Silk Factories Start Up</h3>
<p>After the spring cocoons went on the market this year, the number of cocoons received by the cocoon shops was not large. Due to the low price of cocoons, most of the farmers baked the fresh cocoons into dry cocoons, expecting a good price. According to statistics, about 60% of the dry cocoons baked by all households in the county are dry cocoons, so the cocoon merchants are pessimistic and stopped weighing early. In the past two days, 90% of the cocoon shops have stopped weighing one after another. The silk factories in the county are now preparing to start up one after another. In addition to the 17 factories that have already started up, 6 more factories, including Yichang, will start up to help the workers make a living.</p>
<h3>Wujin Bean Industry Cross-Border Business Case Resolved</h3>
<p>The rice and bean industry in Wujin County previously sold more than 10,000 shi of yellow soybeans to the Hengde Oil Mill under the Gongyun Bridge in the county. On the 5th of this month, they first used ships to transport more than 1,000 shi to Wuxi, and brought their own measuring boxes and measurers to unload the goods in front of the Hengde Oil Mill. This was discovered by the rice and bean industry in the county, resulting in negotiations, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the County Chamber of Commerce convened representatives of the rice and bean industries of Wuxi and Wujin counties and representatives of the oil mill industry in the county yesterday to hold a meeting to mediate and decided on two solutions: (1) The yellow soybeans that have already been purchased from Wujin must be transported to Wuxi as soon as possible within a time limit; (2) In the future, if oil mills in Wuxi purchase yellow soybeans from Wujin, they must be measured in Wujin before they can be transported to Wuxi, and they must not be measured in Wuxi. Both parties expressed their approval. Once the Wujin Rice and Bean Industry Association officially sends a letter of acknowledgement, the dispute can be resolved.</p>
<h3>New Life Talk Meeting</h3>
<p>The staff of the New Life Practice Group in the county held the fourth talk meeting yesterday and resolved the following major issues: (1) The project to pay attention to next week. Because the scheduled work this week is heavy, such as cleaning toilets and cleaning up garbage, it has not been completely completed due to the limited time, so the project this week will be extended for one week, so as to concentrate efforts to complete the practice; (2) The group member of course, Qiming Private Middle School, has never attended the joint memorial week, and should be warned in writing. If they continue to do so, they will be warned in the newspaper and the Education Bureau will be notified to impose disciplinary action on them; (3) The party and government agencies will take turns broadcasting; (4) The general inspection method for cleanliness in the city will be decided. 1. The general inspection for cleanliness in the city will be held at 4:00 pm on the 22nd; 2. The areas responsible for the inspection by each team will be specified by the association in a separate paper according to the size of the area, the distance of the location; 3. When the inspection team departs for work, there is no need to assemble the team. The person in charge of inspection in that area shall send a representative to depart automatically; 4. The person in charge of inspection in each section shall report the inspection results to the association at the end of the inspection, and the association shall forward it to the Public Security Bureau for separate orders for improvement; 5. Attention must also be paid to the branch streets and alleys in that section during the inspection; 6. The chairman of the Promotion Association will convene a talk meeting with the persons in charge of the inspection at 3:00 pm on the 18th to discuss the method.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Cocoon Shops in Four Villages Close One After Another</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the spring cocoon market in Wuyi, the number of cocoons received has been very different from previous years. After days of receiving goods, there has never been a crowded day. The reasons are nothing more than the reduction in the number of farmers and the low price of cocoons, and they are unwilling to sell. Therefore, there are many households that bake cocoons themselves. Most of the cocoon shops in Henglin Qishu Yan, the most prosperous in Dongxiang, closed on the morning of the 9th. Only Huacheng, Huachang, and Li Tongyi are still receiving goods, but only more than ten dan or thirty dan of cocoons are received in one day. They will also close today (the 10th). Other cocoon shops in Nanxiang will receive goods for one more day on the 10th and close on the 11th. All cocoon shops in Beixiang have closed on the 9th. The number of cocoons received by each cocoon shop is not large. The price of cocoons is about 32-33 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: The Consolidated Tax Office Seizes Counterfeit Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Gao Jingting, a tenant in the Xinwansheng Tea and Food Shop in the Beisuo Alley of the city, is a businessman in Shanghai who is unemployed and living at home. He privately produces cigarettes with the Pyramid brand and sells them to cigarette paper shops in the city. A few days ago, he was suddenly inspected by the Consolidated Tax Office, and counterfeit cigarettes were seized in the Yanglehe cigarette shop at the Miaoxiangkou. The truth was revealed. The patrolman of the Nancheng Police Station was informed and went to Gao's house to confiscate thousands of counterfeit cigarettes and brought them to the Inspectorate, which was fined 30 times the amount according to regulations. The director, Wang Wenjie, sent a letter to the county. Yesterday (the 8th), Gu Longzhai and Yang Maoquan, the distributors, were summoned to the county for questioning and were ordered to return home separately. Gao Jingting will be detained and interrogated when he is brought to justice, but Gao has fled. Director Wang has gone to the Xiqu Branch to ask for instructions on how to handle the case.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Provincial Government Rectifies Port Order</h3>
<p>The order at the ports along the river in the provincial capital is extremely chaotic when the ships are about to depart and arrive. Tea house staff and porters do not have signs for identification, and there are no regulations on the price of moving luggage. Rickshaw drivers and porters arbitrarily demand money and hold back goods. Pimps and hooligans take the opportunity to steal, so that passengers regard Zhenjiang ports as a dangerous place. The provincial government has received repeated reports that the root cause lies in the poor management of the shipping companies and the failure of the port police to strictly investigate and perform their duties. If immediate rectification is not sought, it will not only hinder the prosperity of the provincial capital's municipality, but also affect the progress of social undertakings. The Provincial Public Security Bureau has been ordered to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Hengtai Bank in Fairy Town Robbed</h3>
<p>Hengtai Bank in Fairy Town in the county was robbed by more than ten bandits at 12:00 on the 8th. The bandits climbed over the neighboring Tiansheng Tea and Food Shop and broke in, driving the shop assistants into a room and forcing the silver room manager to hand over the safe keys. They robbed more than 6,400 yuan in cash transferred from Zhenjiang and Fanchuan, as well as jewelry pledged for about 3,000 yuan. Chen Yanzhuang, a passerby, had his diamond ring and gold watch taken away as well. It is said that the Tiansheng Tea and Food Shop was also robbed of 30-50 yuan. It happened to be after the police had withdrawn from their posts, so there was no way to call for help, and the bandits were able to escape leisurely. It is said that the Yazhou authorities recovered some of the stolen goods on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Bandit Boat in Sanhe Refuses Arrest</h3>
<p>Zhao Lieping, an inspector stationed in the river police in Sanhe in the county, saw a suspicious boat while patrolling the river a few days ago. He immediately ordered the boat to stop. The boat sped away when it heard the sound. Zhao fired a warning shot. Unexpectedly, there were bandits lying in ambush in the boat, who fired back. A policeman, Qiu Ying, was shot in the leg and injured. A team was sent to surround the boat and arrest the bandits Chen Enhua, Lu Enxia, Zhou Mowen and others. A box gun with 20 bullets and a Browning pistol with 4 bullets were seized and taken to the district headquarters for disposal. The injured policeman has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>More Than 50 Homes Destroyed in Fire in Shierwei</h3>
<p>Many thatched huts are located on the east side of Dongling Academy at the end of Shierwei. Chen Qigong, who makes a living by selling bean dregs, is over seventy years old and lives alone. At about 2:00 am on the 8th, he accidentally started a fire while heating bean dregs. Chen did not make a sound, but quietly took his bedding and fled without a trace, causing a prairie fire. It is estimated that more than 90 homes were burned down. The Wanghexing board factory and the Yuanxingchang wood shop suffered the most losses.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Inspection of Huainan Salt Affairs Tax Police</h3>
<p>The Huainan salt affairs tax police in various districts are currently being inspected by Luo Xideng, an American consultant dispatched by the Ministry of Finance. Tax police teams 3 and 4 of Nantong Rugao are concentrated in Nantong waiting for orders.</p>
<h3>Holding a New Life Cleanliness Joint Sports Meeting</h3>
<p>All sectors of Nantong held a New Life Cleanliness Joint Sports Meeting at the public sports field south of the city at 8:00 am on the 10th. After the meeting, they marched in formation, and carried out district-based propaganda and cleaning.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Expansion of Waterworks Loan Established</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government borrowed 200,000 yuan from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Xingye Bank, and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to expand and improve the waterworks, using 400,000 yuan of waterworks public bonds as collateral. After several negotiations, the contract was signed and established. In addition to repaying the old debts of various banks of 70,000 yuan, 80,000 yuan will be used for the repayment of principal and interest on the second phase of waterworks bonds, and 50,000 yuan will be used to build sand filtration ponds, water storage ponds, and sedimentation ponds in Tiesha River. Construction has begun. The monthly income and expenditure of the waterworks are less than 3,000 yuan, which is subsidized by the municipal government. Now that the Jianqiao project has been completed and the water supply business has increased sharply, the income and expenditure can be offset.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Bandits Disguised as Soldiers Flee to Fenghua</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 am on the 4th of this month, five people with anxious expressions suddenly went towards Gexi in Meixi Township, west of Meishan in the Fourth District of Fenghua. A few moments later, fifteen people wearing military uniforms and carrying wooden-cased guns went to the fields and asked the farmers if five people had passed through, saying that they were chasing five bandits. After speaking, they rested briefly at Tian Tan and went towards Xiwang. Along the way, they gradually gathered to more than twenty people. After arriving at Xiwang, they had lunch at the Zhaocheng Hotel and then disappeared. On the afternoon of the same day, people with similar descriptions were also discovered in Huangqing. After the district chief, Wang Shidan, questioned the police stationed in Fenghua, he learned that no team had been sent to that place, and it was then learned that they were Ninghai bandits who were fleeing to Fenghua because of the recent military and police encirclement and suppression.</p>
<h3>Special Feature: An Impressionistic Account of Economic Investigation in Guangxi Province (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>In addition to the above reasons, we must not forget that there is also an important commercial factor affecting the Wuzhou market, and that is the decline of the special goods industry. The so-called "special goods," also known as "native medicine" or "anti-smoking medicine," are all euphemisms for "opium." The opium industry occupies an important position in the economy of Guangxi. The so-called importance has two different meanings. For example, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces currently rely on "opium" for survival. They use opium to offset import surpluses and exchange it for all other commodities. This is indeed a necessary weapon for maintaining trade balance. Mr. Ding Wenjiang once said, "If you want to prohibit Guizhou from selling opium, you must prohibit the people of Guizhou from eating salt" (the original words are no longer remembered, but the general meaning is like this). In other provinces, such as Guangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan, opium only occupies an important position in government finance. Guangxi itself strictly prohibits the cultivation of opium, but it is still a major transit port. Yunnan and Guizhou opium can be exported through three routes: (1) through Guangxi into Guangdong, (2) through Hongjiang in Hunan into Hankou, and (3) through Sichuan out of Wuhan. Of the opium transiting through Guangxi Province, 70% is from Guizhou and 30% is from Yunnan. The annual volume transiting through the province reached over 37 million taels at its peak (in 1931). This golden age has now passed, but in recent years, the amount of opium transiting through the province is still around 20 million taels. The reason for the decline in opium transit is the impact of the "domestic sales tax." What is the "domestic sales tax"? Originally, when opium from Yunnan and Guizhou arrived in Guangxi, a native drug tax of 500 yuan was levied per thousand taels (one dan), collected at 85% discount, amounting to 425 yuan. When entering Guangdong, another 500 yuan tax was levied. However, most of Guangxi's opium was transported to Guangdong for sale. In order to avoid the heavy taxes in Guangdong Province, Guangxi opium merchants mostly engaged in smuggling. This kind of smuggled opium accounted for half of the total. The Guangdong government, seeing the huge amount of tax evasion, agreed with the Guangxi government that the Guangxi government would collect an additional "domestic sales tax." That is, if opium entered Guangxi and was only transiting, only a transit tax of 500 yuan would be levied. If it was sold locally in Guangxi Province, an additional domestic sales tax of 250 yuan would be levied. In this way, after opium from Yunnan and Guizhou entered Guangxi, if it was to be smuggled into Guangdong, it would be treated as being sold locally in Guangxi and would have to bear an additional 250 yuan of domestic sales tax. Guangdong Province, in exchange, would refuse the import of goods from Hongjiang as a condition for Guangxi to set up a domestic sales tax. Since smuggled goods had to bear an additional 250 yuan of domestic sales tax, plus transportation costs and incidental expenses along the way, smuggling would become unprofitable. The price of smuggled goods was usually 100 yuan cheaper per thousand taels than legitimate goods. Adding transportation and insurance costs, it would cost about 200 yuan per thousand taels (legitimate goods only require 100 yuan for transportation). Although it could evade the 500 yuan legitimate tax, if the domestic sales tax was added, it would be almost the same as the legitimate tax. Moreover, smuggled goods had to risk being seized along the way. Now that profits were not high, no one was willing to do it. As a result, smuggled goods disappeared, and the transit of opium from Yunnan and Guizhou through Guangxi also decreased accordingly. The reason is just that. But now we have to ask, why does the decline of the special goods industry affect the commerce of the entire Guangxi Province? To understand this, we must first understand the economic situation of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. These two provinces are extremely poor and have the least developed transportation. Every year, they have to export opium to exchange for the commodities needed by the province. Wuzhou is a transit port for the import and export of goods to and from Yunnan and Guizhou. Merchants from Yunnan and Guizhou transport opium to Wuzhou, export it from Wuzhou to Guangzhou, and then buy Guangzhou and Hong Kong foreign goods and textiles from Wuzhou and transport them back to Yunnan and Guizhou. Therefore, opium serves as a medium of exchange. Only with opium can the market be active. Now that opium is reduced, other businesses will naturally become depressed. Not only commerce, but also the prosperity and decline of the financial industry will depend on the prosperity of the opium trade. The largest two financial markets in Guangxi, Wuzhou and Nanning, have almost all their financial institutions operating with special goods as their business background. This is a very obvious fact. From the investigation of the opium issue, we can also understand a problem: it can never be solved in isolation. Before other economic problems have been resolved, banning opium will ultimately be just a formality.</p>
<p>Wuzhou is also the birthplace of modern industry in Guangxi (it can also be said to be the only concentration). The Liangguang Glass Factory (jointly run by the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments), Wuzhou Match Factory, homemade kerosene factory, cigarette factory, dyeing factory, ice-making factory, and sawmill are all located here. In addition, there is the power plant run by the Construction Department and the waterworks run by the Municipal Works Bureau. The most interesting thing here is that Wuzhou, although it is the largest city in Guangxi, does not have the native cloth weaving industry that we encountered in Guilin and Liuzhou. This fact seems strange, but it is actually easy to explain. Wuzhou is the gateway for imports and exports in Guangxi and the birthplace of capitalism in Guangxi. It is adjacent to Guangdong and was opened as a commercial port in 1887, according to the Sino-British Burma Convention. Capitalist commodities were the first to enter Guangxi, and Wuzhou was the first shot. The deeper the degree of capitalist penetration, the more profound the destruction of old-fashioned handicraft industry. In Guilin and __________ , relying on inhumane working conditions and commercial capital __________ , the textile industry can still barely survive. Wuzhou can't even do that. Cheap machine-made foreign cloth has already beaten the hand-spun native cloth industry to "abandon their armor and flee" and "disappear without a trace." Is there a more obvious example of the capitalist production method destroying the old feudal production?</p>
<p>Speaking of the Wuzhou glass factory, when we arrived in Wuzhou, it was shut down. The reason for the shutdown is extremely noteworthy. Before talking about the shutdown of the glass factory, we must talk about the homemade kerosene factories in Guangdong and Guangxi.</p>
<p>The so-called homemade kerosene is to import foreign crude oil and refine it into refined kerosene in factories built in China. Strictly speaking, this industry does not deserve to be called a "national industry" because its raw materials have to rely on imports. However, it is slightly better than the direct import of refined kerosene because crude oil is ultimately a semi-finished product. It has to be processed in China before it becomes a finished product. This labor is ultimately Chinese labor, and the capital invested is also Chinese capital. Since the rise in silver prices and the soaring price of kerosene in recent years, the homemade kerosene industry in Guangdong and Guangxi has sprung up like mushrooms and flourished for a time. It is said that in 1932, there were more than 230 homemade kerosene factories in Guangzhou and more than 20 in Wuzhou. Their capital ranged from a few thousand yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. This rapid development could not be tolerated by the imperialist oil companies. Therefore, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Deutsch-Asiatische Petroleum Gesellschaft (DAPG) jointly dumped their products on us. The price of kerosene was 7.5 yuan per can in August and September of the year before last, but it fell to 6.5 yuan in January of last year, further to 5.2 yuan in February, and further to 3.9 yuan in May. There was also an "Economy" brand that sold for only 3.2 yuan. In this way, the life of homemade kerosene could only be sentenced to death because the cost of each can of homemade oil was 3.8 yuan. Therefore, more than 100 of the 230 kerosene companies in Guangzhou went bankrupt. Of the 24 in Wuzhou, 22 went bankrupt. The remaining two were only operating at one-quarter capacity, which is equivalent to only half a factory operating. In addition to dumping, the three companies also used a trick to attack the homemade kerosene industry. They added a little light yellow powder to the refined kerosene, making it look almost the same color as crude oil. In this way, when passing through Chinese customs, they only had to pay the tax on raw materials. After transporting the oil to Guangzhou, they used pressure to precipitate the powder without any effort, and it became refined oil. They used this method to deceive customs inspectors and reduce costs, attacking the homemade kerosene industry at the same time. Later, in order to rescue the homemade kerosene industry, the Guangdong Provincial Government imposed a kerosene business tax in Guangdong, collecting three yuan per box. This was naturally levied on both Chinese and foreign companies, but Chinese kerosene merchants could use the three yuan tax ticket to pay the customs tax, slightly showing their sympathy. Therefore, the oil of the three companies was somewhat restrained in Guangdong, but they are now using diplomatic power to protest and pressure the Chinese government to abolish the special kerosene tax. We don't know how this issue will be resolved, but judging from the above facts, imperialism has the power of life and death over China's national industry.</p>

<h3>Mailmen Had a Grand Review Yesterday, Held in Hongkou Park, with More Than 700 Participants</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration holds a general drill every year to manage mailmen to ensure their physical health, neatness of clothing, and disciplined actions. This year, following the precedent, it was held at Hongkou Park at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 700 mailmen participated. Mr. Chappelin, the Shanghai Postmaster, was the reviewing officer. Mr. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others also attended to observe. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Arrangement</h3>
<p>The review ground was located on the eastern grassy area of Hongkou Park. A circle was marked with white lines on the ground, and small flags were inserted along the edges. Boy Scouts from the post office maintained order. A command platform was built on the north side, two feet high and about ten feet square in width. It was surrounded by railings and pine trees. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung in the center of the platform, with the Kuomintang flag next to it. A loudspeaker was installed in front of the platform. The facilities were very simple. Wooden chairs were placed under the platform in two rows on the left and right for the guests. A bamboo flagpole was set up in the center in front of the platform. The mailmen were lined up in a row at the south end of the field. The band of the post office was seated on the east side.</p>

I hope that you will continue to work hard and serve the community with the spirit of discipline."</p>
<h3>Qu Mu Zang Yao Talks About the Situation of the Southwestern Yi People. The Population of Civilized Yi People Totals More Than 300,000. Developing Education Is the Pioneer of Development</h3>
<p>According to the Daba News Agency, Qu Mu Zang Yao, a specially appointed Party Affairs propagandist for the Yi people in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang by the central government and an investigator sent by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to the southwestern Yi people, is an awakened young man among the Yi people. In 1931, he was sent by the central government to the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang areas to educate the Yi people and engage in cultural work, improving the lives of the Yi people, and has already achieved results. Mr. Qu Mu went to Nanjing in January last year to report to the central government. Now that his official duties have been completed, he has come to Shanghai from Nanjing to await the ship's return to Sichuan. A reporter from the Daba News Agency interviewed him at his residence yesterday and asked him in detail about the situation of the Yi people. The following is a record of what he said:</p>
<h3>Complex Ethnic Groups</h3>
<p>According to him, there are many kinds of Yi ethnic groups, but they can generally be divided into Black Yi and White Yi. Other ethnic groups, such as the Shui Tian, ____ Mo Suan, Qu Qu, and Bird Yi, are gradually being eliminated and are very few in number. Therefore, those who generally study border issues all take the Black and White Yi ethnic groups as representatives. Among them, the White Yi have the largest number, accounting for about 80-90%, while the Black Yi only account for 10-20%. Their lifestyle, language, and writing are roughly similar among the Black, White, and Shui Tian ethnic groups. The ____ Mo Suan, Qu Qu, and Bird Yi mostly live in deep mountains and wilderness, similar to savages, so they are mostly conquered and assimilated by the Black and White Yi ethnic groups. The section of land they occupy is between Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang, but Jianchang Road in Sichuan has the most. According to the population obtained from the investigation, there are a total of 332,420 people, but this refers only to the civilized Yi people who have surrendered and abide by the law. The population of other uncivilized Yi people is not included.</p>
<h3>Primitive Life</h3>
<p>As for the life of the Yi people, due to their low level of culture, it is very simple. Men only wear wool cloaks (called "Cha Erwa" by the Yi people) or wool clothing in all seasons. Their heads are wrapped in long cloth as hats. One end of the cloth is wrapped around their heads, and a bundle of hair is wrapped into a long, pointed shape, called "Tian Pusa." They are most taboo about others touching it with their hands. They often wear knives and swords, amulets, etc. on their bodies. The Black Yi also wear musk tooth bags to show their power. Women's clothing consists of a top and a long skirt, but they do not wear pants. Sometimes they wear square scarves, mainly in black, white, and blue. Young girls often embroider them with patterns. Rich women wear gold bracelets on their hands and feet. However, Yi customs especially respect virgins, who have the power to mediate wars in society and are responsible for management in the family. The Yi people live together in the same branch of Black Yi and White Yi, which is no different from the tribal era in ancient times. However, they pay little attention to hygiene, and some even do not wash their faces or change their clothes all year round. They are extremely superstitious and rely on gods for everything. Trade is mostly done through barter. Only in the more civilized areas of the civilized Yi people are large silver ingots used as currency. However, in terms of lifestyle, they are still the same as the primitive communist society. Regardless of whether they are chieftains or slaves, their enjoyment is no different. If there are beggars, it is a disgrace to the entire tribe.</p>
<h3>Tribal System</h3>
<p>The social organization of the Yi ethnic group is purely a tribal class system. The Black Yi have a blood relationship and are stubborn in nature. Their relationship with the White Yi is like that of lords and slaves in the medieval feudal era, so they often occupy a dominant position. The so-called White Yi are mostly Han people who were captured and served them, and who were assimilated over time. However, Yi people of the same surname are called branches. Each branch has a different number of managers, mostly Black Yi (i.e., chieftains). The handling of disputes is decided by the Tusi Yamen (local chieftain's office), but the Tusi's power is weak, and the Yi people no longer obey. However, each Yi tribe exists for the survival of its own tribe, and they often use the power of their own branch to destroy other tribes, so wars are often heard of. Social sanctions are entirely based on the chieftain's personal judgment. As for the Yi language, the first thing to pay attention to is whether the sound is correct, and then to consider whether the meaning is appropriate. However, very few people can recognize writing. Only the so-called "Bingmu" (religious teacher) and "Suli" (also a religious teacher) can recognize it. The Bingmu and Suli are dedicated to chanting scriptures and praying for blessings, so their research on writing is limited to spells and divination books. The calligraphy of the writing is very similar to German. Chicken blood is mixed with black charcoal, and bamboo sticks are used to write records of the date and year. The Yi people do not use the lunar calendar, only the twelve earthly branches. The method of recording is based on the twelve zodiac signs in common custom.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Work</h3>
<p>Qu Mu finally stated that the main task of propagandizing the Yi people is to eliminate their ethnic boundaries, break the antagonistic psychology of separation between Han and Yi, so as to promote the great unity of the nation and serve as a barrier to national defense in the southwest. At present, various imperialist countries such as Britain and France are actively implementing conspiracies to invade our Kang, Tibet, and Yunnan borders, so we cannot neglect border issues in the slightest. Therefore, when I (Qu Mu) went to Xikang in 1931, I personally went to various places to investigate and established Yi schools, but due to financial reasons, only one term was opened before it closed. However, I was born as a Yi person and deeply know that the current urgent task depends on education. The reason why the Yi people are in a state of barbarism and isolated from the Han people is all because of the backwardness of culture. They would rather burn and loot to live day by day, preserve their primitive lives, and not seek progress. Therefore, when I was in Nanjing, I consulted with the central government on the implementation plan of Yi education, hoping to use this to develop the culture of the Yi people on the borders of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Kang, as the pioneer of the development of the southwest.</p>
<h3>A Chinese Ship Will Operate Overseas. Yonghua is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in the Middle of the Month</h3>
<p>According to the Riri News Agency, the Da Zhonghua Shipping Company in this port purchased a commercial ship from the British firm Atle Company to open up overseas routes. It has a deadweight of 8,000 tons and a formal contract has been signed. The price is about 100,000 yuan and it has been named "Yonghua." The company sent the shipowner, Tian Yaer, from Shanghai on the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship to Hong Kong, and then across the Pacific to inspect and receive it in San Francisco. According to sources from the company, the reporter from the Riri News Agency learned that the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the middle of next month. After arriving in Shanghai, it is decided to operate on the Shanghai-British North Borneo line to load timber. It is rare for Chinese merchant ships of 5,000 tons or more to operate on overseas routes.</p>
<h3>National Buddhists Held a Representative Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Buddhist Association of China held the Sixth National Buddhist Representative Assembly at Jueyuan, Hedde Road, Avenu Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 50 representatives from various provinces and cities attended. Yuan Ying and 35 others were elected as executive committee members, and Nuona and 11 others were elected as supervisory committee members. The meeting will continue today to discuss various proposals. The details of yesterday's meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>
<p>The assembly was held in the auditorium of Jueyuan. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung in the center, with the Kuomintang flag on the left and right. A podium, guest seats, and seats for supervisors and guides were set up. On both sides were seats for the master of ceremonies, recorders, and reporters. The table tops were covered with yellow cloth and decorated with paper flowers. The seats for the representatives from various provinces, cities, and counties were located at the lower end, with names and numbers assigned to each seat, and they were seated in order. The order was very neat.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>Those who attended included representatives from nine provinces and three cities, including Yuan Ying, Miao Ji, Fu Cheng, Lan Chuan, Ming Dao, Zhen Zong, De Kuan, Fu Hui, Guang Xiu, Chang Xing, Shou Ren, Xin Yun, Fan Gu Nong, Yong Chan, Shen Binhan, Fan Cheng, Jie Lian, Hai Chan, Wang Shaoting, Kong Zejin, Da Bei, Zhong Lida, Shuang Ting, Yuan Chen, Yu Lian, De Jun, Da Xiang, Hui Zong, Yue Lai, Xi Jing, Fen Ren, Huang Jian, Da Zhiyuan, Bao Chan, Kong Xu, Miao Lian, Chan Kong, Guan Jiongzhi, Ye Yufu, Li Yunshu, Ke Duan, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Wei Fuzi, Nuo Na, Shi Shengzhi, Yuan Chong, Hui Kai, Kuan Kuo, Jin Xi, Tong Ming, and He Xiu, more than 70 people in total. Mao Yun, representative of the Central Propaganda Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Rao Qiangsheng, representative of the Social Bureau, Liu Jianqiu, representative of the Panchen Lama, and more than 30 guests, including Qu Wenliu.</p>
<h3>Conference Proceedings</h3>
<p>(1) Ringing the bell to take seats, (2) Holding Buddhist rituals, (3) Publicly electing the presidium, (4) All standing at attention to salute the Party, national flag, and the late Premier's portrait, (5) The chairman respectfully reads the late Premier's will, (6) Silent tribute, (7) The presidium takes their seats, (8) The chairman reports the purpose of the meeting, (9) Reporting the number of representatives present, (10) Reporting on the general state of the association's affairs, (11) Reporting on the fifth session's relief efforts, (12) Congratulatory remarks from representatives of Party and government organs, (13) Chairman's reply, (14) Discussing the course of the association's affairs, (15) Discussing various proposals, (16) Provisional motions, (17) Holding election procedures, publicly electing vote counters, announcers, and supervisors, representatives of Party and government organs inspect the ballots, distributing ballots according to number, voting, counting ballots, announcing the vote count, (18) Photographing and adjournment.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>At exactly 10 a.m., the conference opened. After the representatives took their seats in order, Buddhist rituals were held immediately. After the chime of the bell and loud chanting of Buddhist scriptures, five representatives, namely Yuan Ying, Ye Yufu, Da Bei, Shuang Ting, and Nuo Na, were publicly elected as the presidium. Wang Junhe served as master of ceremonies, and Wu Xiaobai as the recorder. After paying respects to the late Premier's portrait, as customary, the chairmen took their places. Yuan Ying was publicly elected to report on the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: Today is the sixth National Congress of this Association, covering nine provinces and three municipalities, totaling seventy-seven counties. Today, representatives from fifty-five counties are present, totaling seventy-one representatives, which is more than half. Although this Association has not achieved any special results in the past year, it has been able to implement the resolutions of the fifth congress in order, and the unity of the members has provided many conveniences for this Association. This shows the great role of Buddhism. Although this is the effort of the Buddhist association itself, it is also indirectly an effort for the country. Although Buddhist organizations belong to the secular world, their relationship with the nation and people is very important from the perspective of religion. Therefore, if all representatives can strive to promote Buddhism, they will also help to create a good environment for the unification and peace of the nation, the people, and all living beings, and so on.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Association Affairs</h3>
<p>Following that was a report on the general state of the association's affairs, concerning the more important of the three hundred and sixty-four matters since the fifth congress, summarized into four items: (1) Buddhist temples and monastic properties: The National Government has previously issued orders to the whole country prohibiting encroachment. However, recent investigations reveal that in various places, temples are still often forcibly occupied by troops, and local organs and groups also arbitrarily seize them. Therefore, this Association has again petitioned the Ministry of the Interior, which forwarded the petition to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, to strictly reiterate the previous order and effectively stop this. Approval was granted under the Ministry of Rites Document No. 68. (2) Last year, the Yellow River breached its banks, and the disaster situation in the provinces along the river was severe. Various charitable organizations formed a Yellow River Disaster Relief Emergency Committee and borrowed 50,000 yuan from various banks in this city to handle emergency relief, and publicly elected three Dharma masters, Hong San, Ming Dao, and Mu Xi, as relief representatives. (3) This Association held a prayer and universal benefit Dharma assembly at its office from July 15th to July 31st of last year to transfer merit to the war dead and wandering souls and to pray for the unification and peace of the country. It also notified all provinces and cities to initiate such assemblies at the same time, to fulfill the righteousness of saving the country. (4) Last year, Yu Hanmou, the army commander of the First Army stationed in Dayu County, Jiangxi, convened the Southern Jiangxi Rehabilitation Conference and resolved to use the monastic properties of temples in southern Jiangxi for educational funding. This Association repeatedly received telegrams from the Jiangxi Provincial Buddhist Association and the Nankang County Buddhist Association, requesting assistance. This Association forwarded the petition to the headquarters of the First Army Group, ordering the revocation of the resolution. Approval was granted to order the army commander to investigate separately.</p>
<h3>Representative's Admonitory Speech</h3>
<p>After the report, Mao Yun, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered an admonitory speech, briefly saying: Today, I am very honored to represent the Municipal Party Department to attend the sixth National Congress of your Association. Buddhism is the only religion in our country, and in all countries around the world, religion is used to assist the great power of politics. Even our Premier once advocated using Buddhism to influence the unity of the nation. The spirit of unity among the members of your Association surpasses that of any other association, and you are especially diligent in the progress of your affairs. I hope that in the future, your Association will pay attention to assisting political work and international affairs. Under the leadership of the government, strive to influence all living beings and promote the spirit of national unity. This is really dependent on your Association. In the end, Rao Qiangsheng, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered an admonitory speech (speech omitted).</p>
<h3>Election of Committee Members</h3>
<p>After the admonitory speeches by the representatives, it was noon, and the presidium announced a recess for lunch. At 1:30 p.m., the meeting continued, electing the executive and supervisory committee members of the sixth session, and adjourned at 6:15 p.m. The election results are as follows: Yuan Ying, Da Bei, Wang Zhen, Ye Yufu, Guan Jiongzhi, Chang Xing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Chen, Bao Jing, Huang Hanzhi, Ming Dao, Fan Gunong, Li Jingwei, Zhong Lijian, Hong San, De Hao, Ren Shan, Shuang Ting, Huang Jianliu, Hui Lian, Ke Duan, Zhi Yuan, Chan Ding, Zhao Yunshao, Shi Shengzhi, Hui Kai, Hui Zong, Tai Xu, Zhen Kong, Di Chuqing, Zhu Qinglan, Yuan Di, Jiao Yitang, Rong Xu, Li Yunshu, Miao Lian, and 36 others were elected as executive committee members.

<h3>Discussion of Proposals</h3>
<p>Today at 10 a.m., the meeting continued in the same location to discuss the proposals from the representatives of various provinces and cities. There were a total of nineteen proposals. Yesterday, the review committee of the conference, Yuan Ying, Fan Gunong, Ke Duan, Chang Xing, and Huang Jianliu, reviewed the proposals, and their opinions are as follows: 1. Establishing regulations for education, 2. Punishing violations of regulations, 3. Unifying educational regulations, 4. Examining and approving abbots. After examining the above four proposals, which all belong to the scope of educational regulations, in the joint meeting of the fifth executive and supervisory committees, regulations for reorganizing education were drafted, and the opinions of each proposal are contained therein. The sixth executive committee should be responsible for handling them as soon as possible. 5. Investigating and protecting temple properties: This Association has already petitioned the National Government, and an order has been issued. This case should not be discussed. 6. Requesting commendation methods for those who promote education: Because the proposer's procedures were not in compliance, this case should not be discussed. 7. A case for establishing a loan agreement when borrowing temples: This case should be handled by local authorities as appropriate. The conference is exempt from discussion. 8. Promoting the White Horse Temple project: Hand over to the Standing Committee to find ways to help. 9. Prescribing the memorial day of Donglai: Hand over to the Standing Committee to hire experts to determine it before announcing it. 10. Omitted. 11. Monastic education: The fifth joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees has drafted educational regulations for Buddhism, pending approval by the Ministry of Education before implementation. 12. Promoting religious teachings: Hand over to the Executive and Supervisory Committees to handle as appropriate. 13, 14, 15. Omitted. 16. Please maintain the established cause. 17. Please draft a proposal for paying membership fees. 18. How to deal with overdue membership fees: Temples should all uniformly recognize the collection of membership fees. After examining the above four proposals, they are all about the collection of membership fees, which is of great importance. Leave it to the conference for public decision.</p>
<h3>Chang Xing's Report</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the election, Yuan Ying, chairman of the presidium, invited Chang Xing, the representative from Fujian, to report on the cause and course of the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Conference to be held in Japan, and the report that Dharma Master Chang Xing of our country would participate. Chang Xing stood up and said: The initiation of the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Conference was led by Buddhists from Japan and Russia. The conference was established in 1931. The first conference was held that year. This year, Japan continued to convene the conference. Beforehand, a Japanese monk, Kanda Keun, who was familiar with Chang Xing, came to Fujian. At that time, his invitation to participate was entirely in a personal capacity. I (Chang Xing referring to himself) was not yet familiar with the conference, so I did not express any opinion. After Kanda Keun returned to his country, he wrote to me, inviting me to attend and participate, and the list of representatives from various countries attached only listed the name of the puppet Manchuria. Since the puppet Manchuria has been denied by our country and not recognized by the League of Nations, at a time when there are obvious international reefs and Japan is trying to disturb our people's hearts, I cannot attend and participate at this time. At that time, I had a back-and-forth exchange of letters with Old Dharma Master Yuan Ying about this matter. Later, I came to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou. In Hangzhou, I met the Japanese monk Fujii Sosen, who also invited me to participate. I only chatted casually at the time, saying that I might be able to visit in the name of a tour group in the future. Unexpectedly, when Fujii Sosen returned to his country, he published in the Japanese newspaper that I would lead a group to participate, and it was spread in domestic newspapers, accusing me of betraying the religion and the country. In fact, the truth of the matter is clear at a glance. Today, I have come to Shanghai to attend the representatives' congress, declare my position, and report on the course of events. The various rumors are absolutely inaccurate. But I intend to organize a Buddhist tour group to travel abroad, and I hope that this matter can be accomplished.</p>

<h3>Cotton Production Improvement and Banking Syndicate Signed a Loan Contract: Syndicate Processes Loans Through Cooperatives, Stipulating Collateral and Loan Procedures</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee, in provinces and districts where cotton planting is developed, and the local highest authorities, have prepared to establish cotton production improvement institutes, and well-organized cotton production and sales cooperatives. It has been discussed and agreed that the China, Jiaotong, Jin Cheng, Shanghai Zhejiang Xingye, and Four Provinces Farmers, and other six major banks will organize a "Cotton Production and Sales Cooperative Banking Syndicate" to be responsible for providing funds. Now, with the certification of the Cotton Control Committee, both parties have signed a contract. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has recorded the full text as follows: The Banking Syndicate, represented by Jin Cheng Bank (hereinafter referred to as Party A), and the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute (hereinafter referred to as Party B), in order to improve cotton production and help cotton farmers, will organize well-organized cotton production and sales cooperatives in Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces. Party A will provide funds to be lent to each cooperative by Party B as an agent, in order to supplement the necessary funds for business operations and achieve the above-mentioned objectives. Both parties have agreed on the following terms: (1) The cooperatives to be loaned funds will be selected by Party B and submitted to Party A for review at any time.

<h3>Penglai Market National Exhibition: Requests Exemption from Stamp Duty for Invoices</h3>
<p>Since its opening on the 1st of this month, the National Products Movement Exhibition at Penglai Market, sponsored by the Federation of Chinese National Product Manufacturers, has been visited by a large number of groups and citizens every day, which is a good phenomenon for the Women's National Products Year. The temporary market attached to the association was previously requested by the Stamp Tax Bureau to affix stamps to invoices, but the association politely refused. The bureau then requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to write to the association to persuade them to affix stamps to the market invoices. The association believes that the National Products Exhibition is entirely for publicity purposes and is not comparable to commercial profit-making. Moreover, previous national exhibitions in this city and other places have not affixed stamps. The association is naturally exempt from affixing stamps. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to explain everything and requested them to inform the bureau. The original letter is recorded below.</p>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The association replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: In direct reply, we received your letter dated June 4, which stated that on June 2, we received Public Letter No. 47 from the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau, which stated that during the National Products Movement Exhibition held in September last year, we requested exemption from stamp duty. The bureau reported the situation to the Jiangsu Stamp, Wine, and Tobacco Tax Bureau, which instructed that all account books and invoices used by the sales department attached to the National Products Exhibition should be stamped in accordance with the regulations, similar to the sales department of the National Products Exhibition Hall. The association believes that the National Products Movement Exhibition is nothing more than promoting national products, which is the duty of the people. Due to limited capabilities and status, we cannot conduct a large-scale movement like the Iron Exhibition in Beiping and the National Exhibition in the capital. It is only like shouting in a play, and it should not be taken seriously. However, those in charge only seek to cover expenses in order to avoid having to beg from door to door afterward to make up for the deficits. As for the factories participating, they are promoting national products to sell. Without subsidies, they cannot operate without seeking profit. In fact, everyone agrees that, from the perspective of the Ministry of Finance's overall revenue, or the goods can be sold more and factory taxes can be improved, and exempting them from stamp duty is an indirect support for the development of national products. Is it a small supplement? The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is a leader in the industry, and the association's truth will definitely be understood. The association's hope is not comparable to those who disregard the foundation of the country. We ask the chamber to explain to the bureau in detail to avoid giving people the impression that the bureau disregards the prosperity of national products. We hereby reply to the previous matter and hope you will check and forward it. We are extremely grateful. This is addressed to the South City Office of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Types of Displays: The display department of the association is located at No. 180 along Penglai Road. There are more than ten factories participating in the displays. All the displays and decorations are unique. The central focus is on the products displayed by the Dahua Rubber Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Sino-French Construction Company, Yidali Rubber Products Factory, and the Second Prison, which are the most eye-catching. There are dozens of types, all of which are self-made. The Huatong Electric Company has also developed a special ice cream freezer for sale in cold drink shops during the hot summer months, which used to be supplied by foreign goods. Now, they have specially invited expert technicians to manufacture the ice cream self-freezer, which does not use electricity or shaking. It is also on display at the association, and all sectors are welcome to purchase it. The prices are very low in order to recover our rights and interests.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telegram Request: Separate Ordinance for Medicinal Narcotics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Nanchang Headquarters; the Ministry of Interior and the Department of Health of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing; the Shanghai Municipal Government; and the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters, saying: (Salutations omitted) Having investigated the Regulations for the Control of Narcotic Drugs, amended and promulgated in November of the 21st year (of the Republic of China), which originally permitted the import and distribution of potent poisonous drugs for medical and scientific use by designated general management organizations, and the Interim Regulations Strictly Prohibiting Potent Poisonous Drugs recently promulgated, which were specifically to prevent people from using these drugs as substitutes for opium, are originally parallel and not mutually exclusive. Therefore, Article 14 of the said regulations also states that matters not stipulated in these regulations shall be handled in accordance with other laws. However, the so-called general management organizations in the Regulations for the Control of Narcotic Drugs have not yet been established. Although pharmaceutical merchants wish to invoke these articles to protect their businesses, they find it difficult to apply them. Moreover, the medical needs cannot be stopped in fact. If pharmaceutical merchants comply with the law, they are honestly afraid of being blamed because of the promulgation of this prohibition. They request that a separate ordinance be promulgated for the sale of medicinal narcotics and that, before the implementation of the above-mentioned ordinance, military police and local health authorities be notified to properly distinguish and handle matters. This is for the sake of ensuring the supply of medical drugs and avoiding unnecessary delays. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we hereby telegraphically request your review and approval. This is truly a matter of public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully proclaims.</p>
<h3>Northwest Research Society, etc., Preparing the Beijing-Shanghai Exhibition of Northwest Products</h3>
<p>The Northwest Problems Research Society has been working diligently to develop various aspects of the Northwest. Some time ago, it sponsored the National Products Northwest Mobile Exhibition Group to hold exhibitions in various Northwest provinces in order to awaken the public and curb the decline. Recently, it plans to transport products from various Northwest provinces to Beijing and Shanghai to open a Northwest Products Beijing-Shanghai Exhibition, hoping that Northwest products can sell well in the Southeast. It is recently heard that the Society, in order to expand its operations, has specially sent Yin Zhufu, Guo Weiping, etc., to cooperate with the Nanjing Northwest Development Association and the New-West Asia Society. A preliminary meeting was held at the Examination Yuan in Nanjing a few days ago. Representatives from each association, Ma Hetian, Guo Weiping, Dong Daoning, etc., attended. It is learned that the following has been agreed upon: (1) The three associations will jointly be responsible for the preparations. (2) The scope will be expanded to include not only Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, but also Xinjiang, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces. (3) The types of goods will not be limited to commodities; all items related to culture, religion, and art will be included in the collection, in order to promote communication between Eastern and Western cultures. (4) The expenses will be the joint responsibility of each association. (5) Detailed regulations will be drafted by Ma Hetian and Dong Daoning. (6) Regarding the items to be collected from Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, Guo Weiping will first be responsible for consulting with the branches of the Northwest Problems Research Society in those areas. In addition, it is also heard that Zhang Puquan, Liu Yunchen, and Zhu Jiqing, members of the Central Committee, have been personally asked to discuss solutions with the authorities in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, so as to broaden the economic prospects for the Northwest provinces.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chu Fucheng Discusses This Year's Sericulture Situation in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Tea and raw silk account for a significant portion of our country's exports. The tea market has recently been almost entirely seized by India and Japan, and the silk industry is in a state of irreversible decline. Even domestic consumers are increasingly adopting imported artificial silk. The future of this industry is deeply concerning. Yesterday morning, a reporter interviewed Mr. Chu Fucheng to inquire about the state of sericulture in Zhejiang this year. The details of his conversation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>This Year's Cocoon Production Quantity</h3>
<p>Mr. Chu first stated that this year, Zhejiang's silkworm eggs are half improved varieties and half local varieties. The price of improved variety cocoons is 23 yuan per dan (unit of weight), only reaching two-thirds of the highest price of 60 yuan. Therefore, farmers feel great pain. Mulberry leaves cost 1.5 yuan per dan, and each dan of cocoons requires 15 dan of mulberry leaves, leaving no profit. However, compared to the 3 yuan per dan for mulberry leaves in Wuxi, they can still lose a little less money. Therefore, there is currently no profit to be made from raising silkworms. Zhejiang province's production of fresh cocoons this year is estimated to be about 10 million dan. On average, 13 dan of fresh cocoons or 4.5 dan of dried cocoons are needed per dan of silk, costing 500 yuan. However, the global standard raw silk market price is 460 yuan in the United States and 520 yuan in France, while Japan's price is only 480 yuan. China's silk production is only over 100,000 dan every eight years, while Japan's production is over 700,000 dan. Moreover, their products are cheap and of high quality, and the global market has been completely dominated by them.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Japan Purchasing Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>He continued by saying that there are two reasons why Zhejiang farmers are unwilling to use improved varieties: (1) Most silkworm farmers in Zhejiang can reel silk, so the cocoons of improved varieties are not as easy to reel as those of local varieties. (2) Even if farmers reel improved variety raw silk using unskilled techniques, they are easily exploited by cocoon merchants, who buy them at low prices. This poor system is also a major obstacle to the improvement of silkworm varieties. Rumors that Japan wants to disrupt our market and buy Chinese silk are likely speculation, as Japanese silk prices are cheaper than Chinese silk. It is unlikely that such a foolish thing would happen. However, it may be possible in Shandong, as the current Jin in Shandong is still 14 liang (unit of weight), which is advantageous in terms of weight, while the market scale in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has long been changed to 13.6 qian per Jin.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Silk Exchange</h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chu said that recent rumors of silk merchants requesting the government to issue silk industry public bonds again are actually inaccurate. As for the issue of establishing an exchange, it depends on whether the plan that he (Mr. Chu) submitted to the government regarding promoting the overseas market and controlling domestic products for the silk industry can be approved. If the government believes that there is no need for control, then establishing a silk exchange and free trade is quite possible.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Order: Closely Monitor Li Guojie, Prohibit Police Officers from Leaving Their Posts Without Authorization; Those Who Leave Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was accused of embezzlement and misappropriation of large sums of money. The local and High Courts have repeatedly tried the case and sentenced him to imprisonment. Li declared his disagreement and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. The case has not yet been investigated or tried during the investigation period. However, Li was seriously ill at the time and requested permission from the authorities to be transferred to the Shanghai Hospital in the South City for treatment. Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordered the Chief Inspector to send several inspectors and police officers to closely monitor him. As Li's illness has not yet fully recovered, Director Wen, considering the seriousness of Li Guojie's case, specially instructed Inspector Li Guangzeng, who was assigned to monitor him, not to allow police officers to leave their posts without authorization. After receiving the order, Inspector Li has already instructed the inspectors to comply, stating that he will conduct inspections at any time or inquire about the situation by telephone. Those who leave without authorization will be reported to the Director immediately and punished according to the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Yousheng Boy Scouts Travel to Putuo</h3>
<p>The Yousheng Boy Scout Troop of Niuzhuang Road is conducting its summer Putuo camping trip. The trip departed on the 15th, taking the Pu'an steamship directly to Putuo from the Bund Customs Pier. Led by Troop Leader Hua Mingsheng, half of the troop's boy scouts are going to camp in the field for five to eight days. Half of the regiment's military members are also departing from the group. The New Life Movement Guidance Team of the entire city is preparing to provide services, under the command of Squadron Leader Gao Junsheng, to ensure all safety.</p>
<h3>Two Large Snakes from Quzhou Transported to Shanghai; Qing Snake and White Snake Appear Near the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>According to Yādōng News Agency, two snakes suddenly appeared in Quzhou, Zhejiang Province, one white and one green, both over three zhang in length, extremely large.</p>
<p>[Image of a large white snake (Yādōng News Agency)]</p>

After local villagers managed to capture them, they were transported to Shanghai and are now displayed in Xu Garden on Kang'nao Road, and will be open to the public for exhibition soon.</p>
<h3>Election and Inauguration of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Pawnshop Industry Association held its membership meeting yesterday at 3 PM. Over thirty representatives including Weng Guoying and Xia Deyang attended.

After formal courtesies were performed, Zhu Yakui representing the City Party Department, Song Zhongqing representing the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Yuan Hongjun representing the City Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches.

It has been learned that the inauguration ceremony is scheduled for the 12th of this month. The announcement is recorded below: We hereby announce that the Association held its inaugural meeting on June 6th and elected the first Executive and Supervisory Committee Members.

<h3>Intestine Industry Association Requests Clear Order for Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Intestine Industry Association, in view of the fact that the issue of rent reduction is related to the prosperity of the market, believes it is valuable to adopt such measures. It specially sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting the City Government to issue a clear order for rent reduction. The original letter stated: Respected Sirs, with the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce, rent reduction is essential for the revival of the market. This proposal has become a powerful public opinion. Since the organization of rent reduction committees by various groups, the rent reduction movement has been underway for four months. Landlords who voluntarily reduce rent are occasionally seen, but those who do not understand the situation and impose pressure are not few. However, the rent reduction issue is not just a one-sided view of tenants, but also a matter that landlords themselves admit is worth studying. We often see advertisements for reduced rent in newspapers, which proves this. However, spending money and time on rent reduction lawsuits for several months causes losses to society and affects the progress of the country. Some argue that they cannot reduce rent, citing the high land prices and low interest rates, but they do not know that the high land prices are created by the public and are not the real capital of the landlords. In view of this, our association believes that if this is not resolved, it will not be a blessing for society. Therefore, we hereby request your association to forward the letter to the City Government, requesting a prompt and clear order for fair rent reduction in order to maintain the people's livelihood and stabilize society. Addressed to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>

Lang Lixun's sculptures, Teng Baiye's finger paintings, and Zhang Shuqi's and Xu Peiji's Chinese paintings are all masterpieces. Therefore, many famous Chinese and Western paintings by Rong Daikuai, Fang Junbi, Zhang Shuqi, and Xu Peiji have been sold in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, visited alone, accompanied and explained by Mr. Sun Fuxi. Mr. Cai smiled and nodded, praising extensively, and carefully examined each work with great interest.

<h3>Actress Fang Xiaotu Commits Suicide by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Fang Xiaotu, an actress currently performing at the Samsung Stage, was 27 years old and lived at 521 Niuzhuang Road. Yesterday around 2 PM, Fang suddenly secluded herself and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. She was discovered and reported to the Lao Zha Gate Police Station. The detective sent Fang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but she was too poisoned and died almost immediately. The hospital notified the police station, who transferred the body to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Mason Falls to His Death</h3>
<p>Chen Zhikuan, a local resident, was 40 years old and worked as a mason at the Xinshengji Construction Company. Recently, the company contracted the project at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, and Chen went to work there every day. It was unexpected that yesterday at around 4:45 PM, Chen was working on a high scaffolding on the roof when he accidentally lost his footing and fell to the ground, injuring his head. He immediately lost consciousness. The nearby police officer reported to the police station, and the Central Fire Brigade's ambulance rushed to the scene and took Chen to Renji Hospital. However, he was too severely injured and died upon arrival at the hospital. The body was transferred to the morgue to await inspection by the court.</p>
<h3>Collapse of Cart Crushes Pedestrian to Death</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 8 AM, Zhengshengyu Timber Store in Kangqu Road, South City, ordered several old workers to send a cart full of timber to Zhabei. When the cart was passing the Xinqiao Bridge in Sanbanchang, just as it was leaving the bridge, a manure cart was blocking the way in front. At this time, a pedestrian named Guo [Name], 26 years old from Shaoxing, tried to hold the cart rope, but used too much force and fell to the ground, with the cart wheels crushing his ribs and damaging his lungs. He was taken to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective and he died at 3 PM.</p>
<h3>A Widow's Unfortunate Fate: Unlucky Encounters Twice</h3>
<p>Wang Suzhen, a woman from Suzhou, is 27 years old this year. At the age of 17, she married Wang Jianming, also from the same village. They lived together in the front building of No. 4 Chongyi Fang, Dalian Bay Road, Huade Road, in the International Settlement. Wang worked as a foreman in a yarn factory, and they had some savings, so their life was relatively comfortable. The couple had a good relationship, but unexpectedly, the good times did not last. Four years after their marriage, Wang Jianming fell ill and died. Suzhen was widowed and did not have any children. Alone, she relied on her late husband's savings to live. At that time, Cao Zhenyan, from Jiading (34 years old this year, currently a senior staff member at Dada Xiang Foreign Goods Store, No. 97 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession), opened Hengda Xiang Foreign Goods Store at the entrance of Chongyi Fang, Huade Road, and served as its manager. Since the back door of the store faced the front door of Wang Suzhen's residence, and they were neighbors, Cao and Suzhen saw each other every morning and evening. They gradually struck up conversations and got to know each other. One claimed to be unmarried and without a wife, while the other was a young widow living alone, yearning for spring. After meeting, their hearts were in sync, and they felt like they had met each other too late. Cao also expressed his willingness to marry Suzhen. As a result, the two gradually developed a relationship. Since July of the year before last, Cao first started cohabitating with Wang at Wang's house, with an agreement to hold a wedding ceremony later. After cohabitating, the two were as close as glue. When Cao needed funds for the store, he borrowed from Suzhen. After a long time, Suzhen learned that Cao already had a wife and children at home. Suzhen's mother confronted Cao, but Cao vaguely prevaricated. After Suzhen's mother repeatedly urged him, Cao accompanied Suzhen to Cao's family home in Tianfu An, Jiading (between Nanxiang and Huangdu). Cao's wife, children, and family members met them, and they learned that Cao's family had eight rooms and over twenty mu of fertile land. After returning to Shanghai, Cao signed an agreement to support Suzhen for life and never abandon her. Soon, Suzhen became pregnant. However, Cao's Hengda Xiang Foreign Goods Store was forced to close down due to poor management on the Dragon Boat Festival last year. From then on, Cao abandoned Suzhen and disappeared. On August 17th, after the Mid-Autumn Festival, Suzhen gave birth to a daughter, named Ruiying, who is now two years old. Cao did not even inquire when Suzhen was in labor. Later, after searching for Cao's whereabouts for a long time, she finally learned that Cao was working at the Baodaxiang Foreign Goods Store. She went to find him, but Cao escaped through the back door. After sending several letters and asking people to demand living expenses, Cao ignored her. At this point, Suzhen, believing that Cao intended to abandon her, could no longer bear it. Also, after Cao abandoned her, all of her husband's savings had been used up, and she was unable to continue living in Chongyi Fang due to debt. She rented out the house and temporarily stayed with relatives in Pudong. On one hand, she hired lawyer Wang Shizong to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District District Court, accusing Cao of making people believe that they were husband and wife, and then committing adultery. After a long time, he became tired of her and abandoned the mother and daughter who were unable to support themselves. She requested that he be punished according to Article 310 of the Criminal Law and sought three thousand yuan in living and child care expenses in a related civil suit. The court accepted the complaint, and on the previous day, judge Li Changnian opened the first criminal court to summon the plaintiff Wang Suzhen and her lawyer to testify about the previous situation. The defendant was represented by lawyer Ge Zheqin, who claimed that the defendant was currently ill and busy with shop matters due to the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, and was unable to attend the court. He requested a postponement. The court verified and inquired, and ruled to postpone the hearing because the defendant was not present and the trial could not proceed.</p>
<h3>Sentenced for Selling Red Pills</h3>
<p>Cao Bingkun, a Chinese detective of the Public Concession Narcotics Department, and Pat, a Western detective, raided a place selling red pills (a substitute for opium) at No. 7, Yong'an Lane, Zhengfeng Street, Dongxi Huade Road, at about 10 AM on the 5th of this month. They arrested the main offenders, Tai Lianting and Xiong Fangwen, from Qingkou, and the accomplices, Hu Tingyun and Zheng Xiaosheng. Along with nine packets of red pills, sixty-three small packets of morphine, and silver and copper coins, they were taken to Huishan Police Station. The next day, they were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. The other day, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the third criminal court and sentenced Xiong Jianting and Xiong Fangwen to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan each. Hu Tingyun and Zheng Xiaosheng were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment, and the seized items were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Criminal Division Chief Judge of the First Special Court Impeached for the Ji Juemi Case; Unfair Trial and Illegal Conduct Deemed Unforgivable; Feng Shide, Xiao Xieben, and Deng Baosun Subject to Disciplinary Action</h3>
<p>The Control Yuan, based on the fact that Feng Shide, Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court of Shanghai, and judges Xiao Xieben and Deng Baosun, etc., were biased and unfair in handling the case of Xu Yuying accusing Ji Juemi, and after Zheng Luosheng filed an impeachment and Li Zhengbo, Li Menggeng, and Du Chen verified the facts, yesterday, the Control Yuan transferred the case to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action. The original impeachment is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Original Impeachment</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Xu Yuying, etc., accusing Ji Juemi, Feng Shide, Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court of Shanghai, and judges Xiao Xieben and Deng Baosun, etc., regarding matters of public morals, Chief Judge Feng Shide and judges Xiao Xieben and Deng Baosun, etc., violated precedent in their handling of the case. For example, despite the high-hanging sign in front of the court prohibiting cars from parking inside, the defendant Ji Juemi was specially permitted to drive his car into the inner gate and park it. Also, although spectators were prohibited during the trial, the defendant Ji Juemi was specially permitted to bring more than ten armed bodyguards into the court. Furthermore, after the trial concluded, the defendant Ji Juemi was allowed to pass through the courtroom and exit through the side door used by staff, which, in contrast to the plaintiff Xu Yuying, showed great bias and unfairness. Other details may be explained away, but the fact that the defendant's armed bodyguards were openly permitted to enter and exit the solemn courtroom at will, not only creating the suspicion of intimidating the plaintiff, but also violating the judiciary with actual violence, is unprecedented in the world. Their illegal conduct is unforgivable. We should report and impeach them according to the law and request that they be transferred for disciplinary action in order to maintain the law and warn against future wrongdoing. Submitted by Committee Member Zheng Luosheng to the President of the Yuan.</p>
<h3>Impeachment Established</h3>
<p>Regarding the reporting of the case, the President of the Yuan submitted the impeachment of Feng Shide, Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court of Shanghai, and judges Xiao Xieben and Deng Baosun, etc., for dereliction of duty and acting out of personal interest, filed by Control Yuan Committee Member Zheng Luosheng. The committee members immediately investigated in detail and unanimously agreed that the judges, in adjudicating this case, gave the defendant Ji Juemi various conveniences beyond the usual practices of the court, which not only damaged the dignity of the court, but also deviated from the norms of judicial decision-making. The case has been verified by this Yuan, and in order to rectify the court's discipline, we request that the impeached Feng Shide, Xiao Xieben, and Deng Baosun be transferred for disciplinary action. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Yuan by Control Yuan Committee Members Li Zhengbo, Li Menggeng, and Du Chen.</p>
<h3>Transfer to Disciplinary Action</h3>
<p>Based on the case brought by Supervisory Committee member Zheng Luosheng, impeaching Feng Shide, the Criminal Division Chief of the Shanghai First Special District Court, and judges Xiao Xie-fen and Deng Bao-sun for showing bias and lack of fairness in handling the case of Xu Yuying's accusation against Ji Juemi, and requesting disciplinary action, the case was duly handed over to Supervisory Committee members Li Zhengle, Li Menggeng, and Du Chen for review. Now, based on the report, the impeached Feng Shide, Xiao Xie-fen, Deng Bao-sun, and others should all be transferred to disciplinary action. Accordingly, copies of all relevant documents are enclosed and forwarded to your committee for verification and handling. Respectfully submitted to the Central Government Employees Disciplinary Committee, Yu Youren, President.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Rapeseed Shipped to Japan, Transported from Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, the rapeseed harvest this year in Hubei and northern Hunan is very abundant, and the cultivated area is also larger than last year. However, due to low market prices, most of it is being kept as rapeseed. Although the Han River area has had a relatively poor harvest due to excessive rainfall, Mianyang, Qianjiang, Shashi, and other places are quite good. Other areas such as Huarong, Jinshi, and Dangde in northern Hunan have had particularly bountiful harvests. Although there are no definite statistics, according to surveys by relevant businesses, the total yield for Hubei Province is estimated at 200,000 dan, and for northern Hunan, 200,000 dan. The amount exported from Hankou in 1929 reached 530,000 dan. Subsequently, affected by floods and communist bandits, rural areas were exhausted, and operations were reduced, only meeting local needs. Therefore, exports to Japan last year were no more than 1,700 dan. In mid-May this year, the initial contracts signed with Japanese companies were only for several hundred dan. Recently, due to the sharp drop in market prices, each dan only sells for a little over three yuan, while in Osaka and Kobe, it can sell for six yuan. Moreover, due to exchange rate factors, the amount exported has already reached 50,000 to 60,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Assassin of Guo Fengzhi, Criminal Approved for Official Apprehension, Xu Zilin Arrested in a Teahouse, Police Agreed to Hand Him Over to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Guo Fengzhi, a Wuxi native who worked as a broker for the Mingfeng Foreign Firm on North Sichuan Road, was assassinated due to selling substandard coal to various foundries for profit. Guo's residence, located at a certain address on Feihongzi Road in Zhabei, was discovered by local vagrants who demanded three yuan per month in protection money. When they attempted to increase it to five yuan without success, Guo was shot and killed at 5:30 AM on the 3rd of this month while going out for water. Guo's wife, Mrs. Lu, reported the incident to the local Public Security Bureau and filed a petition with the local court, requesting the arrest of the perpetrator. At 4:00 PM on the 6th, City Public Security Bureau detective Xia Liusheng was informed that one of the two perpetrators, Xu Zilin from Wuxi, was enjoying tea at the Dele Teahouse at 221 Yuezhou Road. He immediately rushed to the teahouse, and together with Chinese detective Zhou Kaiwen and Chinese constable No. 107, arrested Xu and took him to the Huishan Police Station. The following morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Xu Zilin completely denied the accusations. He was ordered to be remanded in custody pending a formal transfer order from the local court's procuratorate. Yesterday, detective Xia Liusheng delivered an official letter to the Third Criminal Court, and the Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, expressed his agreement. Judge Liu Yugui ordered that Xu Zilin be handed over to the City Public Security Bureau officers for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Naughty Children, Pranks by Little Suzhou, Gathering Children to Intimidate and Defame, Parents of Girls Should Not Be Fooled by These Rascals</h3>
<p>Naughty children Little Suzhou and Little Amao, etc., gather a group of boys aged thirteen or fourteen every evening, and roam around Dongxi Zilaihuo Street, Dongxinqiao Street, and the vegetable market in the French Concession. They specialize in surrounding and insulting solitary children walking on the road, or tricking them out of money to buy candy and other things to share. Recently, they had a whimsical idea: they found out the names of Chen Gendi and several other girls from Dexing Lane, wrote a draft of a love letter that was neither coherent nor understandable ("I love you"), sent it to Ye Maigen, who lives in the same lane, is fifteen years old, and is currently in the third grade of a certain elementary school, forcing him to copy a letter. After it was written, it was taken to Maigeng Lane in Dongxinqiao and placed in a trash can with a square piece of red paper pasted on it, with intimidating words such as "Someone will come and take it away, otherwise don't walk on the road." After receiving this draft, Ye, fearing being beaten, had no choice but to copy the letter and send it as instructed. However, after these rascals obtained the letter, they pooled their coins and sent a letter by express post to the home of Chen Gendi, a girl in Dexing Lane, a few days ago. It was discovered by the girl's parents, who were furious. They initially scolded Gendi, who was completely clueless. Later, a child from the neighborhood (also one of the naughty children) leaked the news, which was learned by the Chen family, who prepared to demand an explanation. Fortunately, neighbors in the same lane interceded, and Ye was also being tricked by others. Ye's parents apologized and settled the matter. However, the true names of the naughty children, such as Little Suzhou, are unknown, making it impossible to investigate. It is said that more than ten such letters have been written and sent to families with girls in the area. Parents should pay attention and not be fooled by these naughty children.</p>
<h3>Penalties in the Fourth District, Large Number of Trash Cans, New Penalty Method in the Police Force</h3>
<p>Since Long Xi succeeded as District Chief of the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau, he personally inspects the beat officers every day. Therefore, he is thoroughly aware of the public sentiment and sanitation conditions in various places. He previously issued notices ordering food vendors to prepare gauze covers to prevent flies from licking the food. The other day, seeing that the entrances of various shops were filthy, he personally led two patrol officers, Wang and Peng, and more than thirty patrol officers to persuade people to conduct a major cleanup of the roads. Yesterday, he found that 24 businesses, including the Gongxing Coal Company on Haichang Road, had placed filth at their entrances. He ordered sanitation officers Tang Shaoji and Li Yusheng to summon them. After questioning by District Officer Zheng Zuhan, the following penalties were imposed. Hu Rongkun of Gongxing Coal Company on Haichang Road, Xu Guirong of the tobacco and paper shop at 422 Datong Road, and Chen Shenshi of the copper workshop at 6152 Guangzhao Road were deemed to have committed more serious offenses and were each fined two trash cans. Wang Fuchang, a native of Changshu at 165 Jinling Road, Tao Hengsong at 24 Huakang Road, Xu Zhaorui, a native of Yangzhou at 37 Huakang Road, Wang Yinghuai at 50 Huakang Road, Zhang Kongshi at 193 Meituan Road, Chen Zhushi at 242 Gonghe Xin Road, and Zai Guisheng, Zhuang Yushan, Zhang Azhang, Chuan Xinsheng, Chen Xushi, Wang Shiyuan, Wang Guiyang, Bao Yixiang, and Qin Baohe, a total of fifteen people, were each fined one trash can. In total, twenty-one trash cans were fined. Yin Shishi, Tang Wushi, Lou Jinshi, Liu Changgui, Feng Jinsheng, and Chen Gushi, six people with less serious offenses, were each fined one yuan. In addition to the fines, all those fined trash cans must deliver them to the authorities within three days for distribution to various locations so that citizens can dispose of their garbage.</p>
<h3>Buying a Concubine in Name, But a Prostitute in Reality, Wang Atao and Zhu Laoer Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Chen Aying, a woman from Wuxing, is now eighteen years old. Years ago, through a matchmaker, she married Chen Arong, a fellow villager, and lived with him at 11 Zhonghua Lane, Zhengjia Wood Bridge. However, Aying was quite promiscuous and restless, and became acquainted with Wang Atao, a local man. On March 18th of this year, she ran away with him, pretending to be traveling to have a private affair. However, Wang was not wealthy, and after spending more than a month, his funds were depleted and he could not make ends meet. He discussed with Aying the idea of marrying her to Zhu Laoer from Jiangyin as a concubine, using the proceeds to sustain their lives. Aying agreed. Wang then discussed the plan with Zhu Laoer and others in Room 29 of the Qichang Hotel at 588 Jiujiang Road. However, Zhu Laoer was actually running a brothel. He was not buying Aying as a concubine, but to work as a prostitute. The matter was discovered by Chinese detective No. 199 of the Huishi Police Station, who arrested Wang Atao and Zhu Laoer the other afternoon. Yesterday, they were brought to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them under Article 246 of the Criminal Code, stating that further investigation was needed and requesting a postponement. When questioned, the two defendants only admitted to selling Chen Aying as a concubine, denying that they had bought her to be a prostitute. Judge Wu Xiangzu verified the statements and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chicago Exposition, Fourth Batch of Exhibits to be Shipped Tomorrow, Thirty-odd Crates of Beijing Bronzeware and Yantai Lace</h3>
<p>The fourth batch of exhibits for China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, including Beijing bronzeware, Fujian lacquerware, Yantai lace, and straw products, totaling over thirty crates, is scheduled to be shipped to Chicago tomorrow (the 12th) by the Dollar Steamship Company's President Jefferson. It is expected to arrive around the end of this month or the beginning of next month. After this batch is shipped, preparations will begin for the fifth batch of exhibits. According to a certain person from the association, the association originally planned to ship in five batches, but now it is feared that there will be more than that number. If the Beijing exhibits and Shaanxi exhibits can be successively transported to Shanghai for crating, there will be at least seven or eight batches. Otherwise, it is impossible to predict when it will end. However, the association has repeatedly stated that if exhibits from distant places cannot be transported to Shanghai before August of the lunar calendar, the association will keep them for storage and transport them to participate in the Brussels Exposition next year. Furthermore, as the association will be changed to participate in international exhibitions, it is currently busy drafting organizational guidelines and all official documents.</p>

Junior high school students who are about to take the joint examination this year should rush to the Great Eastern Book Company to purchase a copy for preparation.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I was shocked to read the news item "Adulterous words lead to family ruin" in your newspaper on the 6th of this month. Upon investigation, Xu Cheshi is the goddaughter of my wife, Mrs. Lu. She came to my place on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month in the 22nd year of the old calendar, asking me to introduce her husband, Xu Keqin, to a job and stating that they could not maintain their current living situation. Her words were pathetic, and my wife, seeing her pity, asked me to find a way to help. Therefore, I introduced Xu Keqin to typesetting work at a certain newspaper, so that he could maintain his livelihood, and provided relief out of familial affection. Later, there was a dispute between Xu Keqin and Mrs. Che, but my wife does not know the reason. Therefore, what your newspaper reported is completely inconsistent with the facts. Since this concerns our reputation, I dare not remain silent. Therefore, I respectfully request a correction to clarify the truth and maintain our reputation. I am anxiously awaiting your response.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, Cai Baofu, June 6th.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>We hereby state, according to the statement from our client, Ms. Cai Wu Xueli, that she read the telegram published today (the 8th) regarding the dispute between us and Cai Xiaobai, and it is completely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we respectfully request your lawyers to write to the newspaper to make corrections. Accordingly, we hereby make the following corrections: (1) Regarding the age section, Ms. Wu is only 26 years old this year. Your newspaper reported her as 32 years old, which is incorrect. (2) The section about the letter of repentance is also wrong. This was just a game, and both sides had such documents. It is ridiculous that Cai Xiaobai presented it as evidence this time. (3) Regarding Ms. Wu hitting Cai Xiaobai with a porcelain basin, this is inconsistent with the facts. On the 30th of last month, Cai Xiaobai beat Ms. Wu in revenge for failing to force her to sign a divorce agreement. Ms. Wu immediately reported this to the police station, and she was trying to avoid him, so how could she hit him?</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, Gu Weixiong, Zhu Jiayu, Xu Pengfei, lawyers, June 10th.</p>
<h3>Another Discussion on Whether the Remittance System Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>— Feng Yigui</p>
<p>I have previously written about the question of whether the remittance system should be abolished. However, those who argue for its abolition are still rehashing old arguments, touching on minor details to bolster their case, hoping to sway public opinion, but without carefully examining the reality of the situation. Those with understanding regret this. A beautiful jade needs to be polished, and a clear mirror needs to be wiped clean. I am fortunate that the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. Therefore, I have written this article again.</p>
<p>Those who advocate for the abolition of the remittance system today say, "During the high tide of advocating for the abolition of the tael in the ninth year of the Republic [1920], enlightened people had already published articles stating, 'Abolishing the tael and reforming the currency should start with abolishing remittance silver first,'” to show that their idea is not original. However, even based on this point alone, we can prove that their argument is untenable. At that time, those who advocated for the abolition of the tael said that remittance silver was the biggest obstacle to abolishing the tael. Without abolishing remittance silver, the goal of abolishing the tael could not be achieved. Even though we told them that the obstacle to abolishing the tael was not remittance silver, but the insufficient supply of silver coins and the lack of opportune timing, we could not dispel the doubts of some people. More than ten years have passed, times have changed, and the abolition of the tael and currency reform were successfully achieved after the Shanghai Mint began minting coins, like water flowing into a prepared channel. Yet, the remittance system continues to function as before. Our painstaking efforts to argue at the time have been vindicated. Whether the remittance system is the sole obstacle to abolishing the tael and whether it can be abolished with mere words is something that everyone can see. Today, those who argue for its abolition are rehashing old arguments to show that their argument has a basis. But if the old argument is untenable, how can the lofty claims based on the old argument be valid?</p>
<p>Some argue that the reserve figures in Shanghai in mid-May of this year prove that the currency supply is excessively loose, reaching an extreme, and that reform should be implemented immediately. Such a narrow-minded view is not something that enlightened people would dare to agree with. According to customs records, for the past six or seven years, both goods and silver bullion have been net imports. Only last year did goods remain net imports, while silver bullion became a net export. However, in previous years, when silver bullion was a net import, the Shanghai reserve was not seen to increase. But now, when silver bullion is frequently flowing out, the reserve is felt to be excessively loose. This abnormal situation is entirely due to the bankruptcy of rural villages in the interior and the concentration of cash in cities. Recently, the government has been working hard to build the national economy, and Shanghai banks are also competing to invest in rural areas, with noticeable results. Soon, the rural economy will gradually show signs of recovery. When that happens, the cash concentrated in Shanghai will inevitably return to the rural areas. Wouldn't there be a feeling of insufficient currency supply as cash flows out of the country on one hand and is transported to the interior on the other? Furthermore, although the current reserve of Chinese banks has reached 200 million yuan, after deducting the reserve for issuance, how much is actually available for use? Whether they can calmly cope with market tensions must be considered. The good credit of soft currency is due to the sufficient reserve of hard currency; otherwise, it would be difficult to maintain. In short, we cannot think only of the current excessive currency supply and not consider the future difficulties. The lessons of the past are not far away. I hope to share this with those who argue for abolition. The remittance system does not cause any fundamental losses to Chinese businesses. I have already explained this. Yet, those who argue for abolition worry that foreign businesses have already factored in the losses from receiving payment the next day into the price of goods. In that case, would the interest losses suffered by issuing banks when they attract customers with seven- or ten-day payment periods also be borne by people outside the financial industry? As for the claim that merchants sell goods and receive remittance notes on the same day, but when they buy goods, they must bring cash to other places, inevitably incurring a discount and losing one day's interest, this is probably said by someone who does not understand the Shanghai business situation. Merchants can deposit the zhuangpiao [bank notes] into their regular bank, and they can immediately withdraw cash. How could there be a one-day loss? With the convenience of opening accounts in banks these days, anyone with a little business knowledge is well aware of this. If we worry about one or two small merchants who are not familiar with this practice, then we should also worry about people being deceived and receiving counterfeit banknotes when accepting banknotes. Should we abolish the issuance of banknotes for this reason? As for the argument that money shops failed to cut off ties with those who directly or indirectly traded under economic aggression, otherwise their gains would be greater than the remittance system, such arguments are not what we want to discuss. Freedom of trade means that even the powerful countries of England, America, France, and Germany can only build high tariffs to protect themselves. How much more so our country, and how much more so money shops? This is why the remittance system has always been the only line of defense against economic aggression.</p>
<p>Some say that the existence of the remittance system allows money shops to monopolize the addition of "water" [profit] on the head of the remittance. In that case, should we also say that the daily fluctuations in domestic remittances and remittance rates in various places are monopolized by the banking industry? Anyone who knows the law of supply and demand in economics will know that this is nonsense. As for the claim that the remittance system allows money shops to absorb bank funds, regardless of whether "recently, the market is flooded with floating capital, and money shops do not welcome bank deposits," as the arguers claim, even if money shops eagerly want to attract bank funds, they cannot force banks to deposit funds with them through the remittance system. The right to trust and deposit or not deposit rests entirely with the banks. If banks do not want to deposit funds, money shops cannot force them, just as banks cannot force money shops to accept deposits if they do not want to. I remember two years ago, when enlightened people were discussing the abolition of the tael and currency reform, some said that money shops relied entirely on silver taels to survive, using them to absorb bank deposits. Once silver taels were abolished, banks would no longer need to deposit funds with money shops, and money shops would no longer be able to survive. At that time, we refuted this fallacy and pointed out that money shops had been in business for decades before banks. Today, more than a year after the abolition of the tael, banks continue to deposit funds with money shops, and the prosperity of money shops has increased even more than before. We are fortunate that the facts have proven us right, so there is no need to engage in eloquent debates and waste our breath.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are those who say that with the proliferation of banks today, many of them have adopted the remittance system. Even the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have recently established branches and switched to using remittance to facilitate their customers. This shows that the remittance system has its own unique advantages and proves the true value of the remittance system. As for promoting the overall cooperation of the financial industry, I believe that a few banks that use headed silver dollars can voluntarily abandon headed silver dollars, so that all Chinese banks and money shops can use remittance silver dollars for transactions, which would create uniformity externally and unity internally.</p>
<p>I have written this article again to clarify the truth and avoid emotional disputes. I do not wish to discuss irrelevant matters.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On the Contradictions of Life (4)</h3>
<p>Today is a summary of the previous three discussions, but due to</p>
<p>space limitations, only a few key points can be briefly highlighted. Fortunately, our discussion of life is</p>
<p>multifaceted, and any shortcomings can be addressed at a later opportunity. Editor</p>
<p>5.  How to Overcome Contradictions in Behavior</p>
<p>Can all the contradictions in life be overcome? Does overcoming contradictions in life mean denying the contradictory nature of the life process? No! Not at all! In principle, the contradictions in life can be divided into two types: relative and absolute. Absolute contradictions cannot be overcome. For example, in the era of monarchs, the nobles and serfs. Although a few nobles might have had great sympathy for the serfs, experiencing a contradiction in their thoughts that differed from their own status, this sympathy was limited. When their own serfs rebelled, they would still believe that suppressing the rebellion was the truth. This shows that such an absolute contradiction cannot be overcome. Conversely, if a serf absorbed the ideas of the nobles at some point, although his thoughts would temporarily show a contradiction with his original status, this contradiction is relative, because his living conditions would eventually make him realize the truth. Also, the middle class may sometimes have sympathetic thoughts towards the lower class. As long as this class is on the verge of decline, the contradictions in their thoughts also become relative contradictions that can be overcome. Overcoming contradictions in life means leading to these relative contradictions, using these contradictions to reduce the phenomenon of contradictions in behavior, and developing life. This does not deny contradictions, because relative contradictions are still contradictions, and they still exist continuously.</p>
<p>But how do we overcome these contradictions?</p>
<p>We know that the biggest contradiction in the lives of monks is the contradiction of sex. (Contradictions in physiology are not absolute contradictions.) Because food and sex are human nature, monks are allowed to have appetites for food, but they absolutely reject sexual desire. But they are still flesh and blood, and they still have sexual needs. How do they overcome this "instinct"? We know that they use the method of "impure contemplation" in their concepts, and "chanting scriptures" and very strict rules in their daily lives. We can see the rules carved on stone tablets in every large temple, prohibiting sodomy and forbidding sleeping with young monks in the same bed. Violating these rules would result in whipping for minor offenses and expulsion from the temple for major offenses. Naturally, these methods are suppression, not overcoming. Because impure contemplation says that women are dirty, how impure, how terrible and ugly women are when their skin and flesh are removed, but in reality, women are not like that. They are indeed gentle, beautiful, and lovely, which is the exact opposite of what impure contemplation describes. Therefore, impure contemplation cannot have the ability to overcome "sexual desire" conceptually. As for the strict "rules," they only illustrate the intensification of this contradiction. The lives of monks are not as clean as generally imagined. Their contradictions are just covered by the cassock. How can we talk about overcoming them?</p>
<p>Parents often use extremely harsh methods to overcome the contradictions in the lives of their children or students, but the result is often counterproductive. In many narratives of personal struggles that end in failure, we see that most of them fail because of the wrong methods, failing to guide the contradictions in life to the right path.</p>
<p>These mistakes all occur because they deny the contradictory nature of the life process, therefore, they think that contradictions in behavior can be suppressed or conquered subjectively. In fact, this is a big mistake. To overcome contradictions in behavior, you must first understand the root of the contradictions and understand this problem in development.</p>
<p>For example, if a person's thoughts and actions cannot be unified, what path should you take to overcome this division? We feel that this is not your ambition or oath, but your life. If you advocate "returning to the countryside," and "returning to the countryside" is your ideal, but your daily habits prevent you from living a rural life, then you must simplify your life, get used to hardship, or live in the countryside for a short time before going to the countryside, or even live in the countryside for a long time, learning all the unfamiliar aspects of life in the countryside. If your real life is rural, your theory will naturally only move forward, and your thoughts and actions will naturally be unified.</p>
<p>Overcoming a contradiction is not a matter of one day or one night. To prevent yourself from falling, you must fight against various bad habits in your daily life. There is a Chinese saying, "A general must first rot himself before insects are born." To prevent insects from being born, you must first prevent rot. A person's fall is usually an imperceptible sinking. For example, a person who talks about the interests of the public may accept a most progressive idea in thought, but his private life is like that of a noble. This private life will inevitably lead to inconsistency between his words and actions, magnifying the contradiction between the two and causing him to go in the opposite direction. This is because the weight of the contradictions that make up his life is more downward than upward. Once it reaches a certain level, he will undergo a violent change. To lead this contradiction upward, we can only increase the weight of the "upward" contradiction. That is, to always maintain consistency with thoughts in private life, and to fight stubbornly against downward contradictions. This is the only way to prevent rot.</p>
<p>The correct way to overcome contradictions between thoughts is to misunderstand the development of thoughts and not to stop at a certain stage. Because stopping is increasing the weight and development opportunities of downward contradictions. Promoting the development of thought is to integrate new things in objective practice into one's own thought, making one's thought more systematic, concrete, and practical.</p>
<p>As for contradictions between actions, as long as the latter is more progressive than the former, the inconsistency of actions is not objectionable. Conversely, it is a downward development. Firmly acting downward means first firmly keeping one's thoughts upward and objectively moving upward, at the same speed as social practice.</p>
<p>Overcoming contradictions in any field of life is to strengthen the impact of contradictions and create the conditions for upward contradictions to overcome downward contradictions. But the path to overcoming this is different for everyone. Some people can transform their lives in a short period of time, while others have to take a long path and spend a lot of time. A person should always see himself as a learner of life and should review the videos taken in his mind at any time and place, because these knowledge gained from the senses are the raw materials that make up your thoughts. Some of them are very nutritious, and some are toxins that erode the vitality of life. And these impressions are all imperceptibly seeping into your thoughts and affecting your behavior. Therefore, a young person should know that falling is an unconscious downward development, and upward development cannot be achieved in one day, but is also achieved through arduous struggles.</p>
<p>The life process of a person is contradictory. Contradictions promote the development of your life and can also wither your life. People grow in contradictions and die in contradictions. To grasp the correct life, it is to not grow contradictions, and not to fight against contradictions. The most fearful thing in a person's life is to stop in a state of neutrality. A person's life must be a continuous battle. Only those who can overcome downward contradictions are the winners in life. (The End)</p>

<h3>President Yan Fuqing of National Medical College Helps Qiu Feihai Form Shanghai Tennis Club. Contract Signed Before Physical Education Association Receives Notice</h3>
<p>The entire sports field being reclaimed is a major blow to the sports community</p>
<p>The entire sports field of the Chinese National Physical Education Association on Father Labour Road has been donated by the American oil tycoon Rockefeller Foundation for the construction of a hospital and medical college of the National Shanghai Medical College. The Physical Education Association will complete the relocation this month, and the Medical College will officially take over from July 1st. However, the funds raised by the Medical College over the years are still less than one million, so the construction project is difficult to realize for the time being. Moreover, because there is too much land, even if the medical college and hospital are built, such a large area is not needed. Therefore, a part of it will be subleased to others, such as the football field on the west side leased to the French Engineering Department, and the tennis court on the south side leased to Qiu Feihai to continue operating the tennis club. However, the Medical College does not give the Physical Education Association the priority to lease, which has caused dissatisfaction in the sports community. As for Qiu Feihai's plan, it has now been successful and is named the Shanghai Tennis Club. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Conducted Secretly</h3>
<p>The motive for organizing the Shanghai Tennis Club existed even before participating in the Far Eastern Games. Beforehand, Qiu Feihai had considerable contact with the Shanghai Medical College. Mr. Qiu could not have known that the field would be reclaimed. The Medical College's offer to Mr. Qiu is extremely obvious. According to Zhou Jiaqi, an executive of the Physical Education Association, Mr. Qiu had talked to him about this matter while the Chinese delegation was on their way to the Philippines. Zhou was quite surprised because he knew nothing about it beforehand. He asked Mr. Shen Siliang, but Mr. Shen had also not heard anything about it. Unexpectedly, upon returning to Shanghai, the notice of relocation from the Physical Education Association had been received, and the contract for the Shanghai Tennis Club had already been signed. How agile the tactics!</p>
<h3>Father-Daughter Relationship</h3>
<p>One theory is that Qiu Feihai's lease of the land for the Chinese Tennis Club was negotiated by Qiu's friend Chen Bingzhang. Another theory is that the main force behind this matter was still Yan Fuqing, the president of the Medical College, because Chen Bingzhang's wife, Ms. Yan Yaqing, is Yan Fuqing's daughter, and Qiu and Mr. and Mrs. Chen are very close friends. Qiu's lease of the land can be said to be entirely due to Ms. Yan Yaqing's word in front of her father. The contract is temporarily for five years, and if both parties agree after five years, it can be extended for another nine years. As for the rent, it is practically equivalent to nothing.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Members</h3>
<p>After Qiu took over, he renamed it the Shanghai Tennis Club and has been recruiting members from all sides. In addition to Chinese people, many Westerners have also been invited to join. The annual membership fee is thirty yuan, and half for female members. It is planned to build a small-scale clubhouse, divided into offices, changing rooms, rest rooms, and bathrooms. All the equipment and bleachers on the field will be purchased from the Physical Education Association at an assessed price. As for the future plans, there has been considerable contact with the Physical Education Association, such as the Rotary Cup Shanghai International Tennis Tournament hosted by the Physical Education Association, which can still be held on the field. The Chinese Society in the lawn league can also still hold competitions on the field.</p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>If the entire area of the tennis court is built with ball courts, there could be as many as twenty or thirty courts. But limited by funds, they cannot all be built. There are six original grass courts and four hard courts. This year, they will be slightly repaired and not expanded. Starting next year, it is planned to build a total of ten grass courts, with a large gate for entry and exit on Baylor Road. In winter, it is also planned to build an indoor court for badminton competitions.</p>
<h3>Physical Education Association Expresses</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Physical Education Association, the Medical College's failure to give the Physical Education Association the priority to lease the land is regrettable. The Physical Education Association cannot rectify all the fields because it is always in a precarious situation. The Rockefeller Foundation can reclaim the land at any time. If it is rectified, and a notice of relocation follows, wouldn't it all be a waste of money? If a lease contract of five to ten years could be obtained like the Shanghai Tennis Club, the Physical Education Association would also be willing to invest funds to repair it and would never want it to be as dilapidated and deserted as it is today. This is not only a setback for the Physical Education Association, but also a huge impact on the Shanghai sports community. It is said with endless sorrow.</p>

In the second and third sets, the competition was very intense. Kramm's double skills were also extremely sophisticated. The German team resisted fiercely, and it was not easy for France to win. In the fourth set, Germany chose to take the offensive throughout. Borotra made repeated mistakes, but fortunately Brunignon gave his full support. The two sides were evenly matched for a while. Borotra finally cheered up and assisted Brunignon, and finally won by ten to eight.</p>

<h3>Walking Association Practiced Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Walking Association has long arranged the steps and proceeded step by step in preparation for the 50,000-meter race. Yesterday, they practiced a seventeen-mile walk. More than ten people participated, including Yao Yaying, Tan Chongsheng, Wang Shufang, Ge Zhishang, Liu Linqian, Yang Guangyao, Yang Derun, Tang Wenyi, Qiu Dechang, Ju Sanbao, and Zhang Huidong. Cai Zhengyi was unable to attend due to wetness in his hands and feet. They set off at 6:30. The association specially sent Zhang Zaojiu and Lu Yutian to guide them along the way in a carriage. Because the weather was too hot, the sunlight was directly facing their faces when they returned, resulting in slightly worse results, but the posture was very good. Only one or two people's legs and knees were not straight, and their shoulders were raised. I hope there will be improvements. Two people changed to walking thirteen miles. The names of those who completed the entire course are listed below in order: Tang Wenyi, Yao Yaying, Yang Derun, Yang Guangyao, Liu Linqian, Wang Shufang, Ju Sanbao.</p>

<h3>Patriotic Sports Performance Results</h3>
<p>A Stalwart Force in Physical Education</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, at 6 PM, the Patriotic Girls' Middle School of this city held a sports performance at the school, displaying the achievements of their daily coursework to the public. The weather was clear after a recent rain, and the wind was calm. Representatives from various organizations and groups, student family members, school board members, and alumni attended, totaling nearly two thousand people. The entire program consisted of over twenty items, mainly focused on physical education. The girls demonstrated that they were not inferior to heroes. Briefly, the traditional Chinese martial arts, such as Yanqing Boxing and Erlang Boxing, showed powerful and steady skill. The dances, such as New City Dance and Bean Picking Dance, were lively and graceful. The apparatus exercises, such as parallel bars and vaulting horses, displayed correct posture and agile movements. The human pyramid formation was cleverly designed and dynamically varied, particularly considered a masterpiece. The various common exercises, such as German gymnastics, farm work imitation exercises, clapping exercises (junior high), Tai Chi exercises (teachers' second year), and flexible freehand exercises (senior high), all featured new teaching materials. The marching formations were intricate and varied, and the movement methods all conformed to the principles of organic development. Other activities like balance beam and mat exercises were also commendable. This level of achievement could not have been reached without strict training. In the individual performances, Bai Guiying, a junior high student, performed with double swords, and Wu Yunzhuo and Xu Jiazeng, the school's coaches, made guest appearances with single swords. The cold light flashed, making it unapproachable, evoking thoughts of the Han moon and Qin passes. After the fire baton performance concluded the event, the gathering ended past 10 PM, and the audience returned home satisfied.</p>

<h3>A Letter to All University Faculty and Staff in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To all presidents, faculty, and staff of universities, colleges, and specialized schools in Shanghai: This association is sending a document to the Ministry of Education today regarding improving the treatment of university faculty and staff and respecting academic research. The document states: "To the Ministry of Education: We believe that universities are the highest educational institutions in a country, and they are of utmost importance to national culture. At present, university education is declining and is on the verge of bankruptcy. While there are many long-term causes, the reduction in university education funding, the low salaries of faculty and staff, and the commercialization of school administration are also major immediate causes. We believe that the following points should be improved, and we humbly present them to your ministry one by one, focusing on those that are simple and easy to implement: 1. Increase funding for national university education. In European and American countries, education funding accounts for more than 3% of the annual expenditure, and university education funding accounts for about 60% of the total education funding. In contrast, the difference in our country is vast. Therefore, we request your ministry to make every effort to increase university education funding. 2. Subsidize private universities. In European and American university education, some are entirely run by the state, while others are jointly run by public and private entities. The number of private universities in our country is no less than that in the United Kingdom and the United States, but those with a solid foundation and excellent management are rare. This is because they have financial difficulties and are struggling to make ends meet. School authorities are exhausted from raising funds, and society still cannot avoid the criticism of commercializing education. It is distressing to see teachers and students in such difficult circumstances. The government should allocate funds to subsidize them as much as possible and encourage them to become institutions of learning. Therefore, we request your ministry to plan large amounts of money to reward private universities. 3. Improve the treatment of faculty and staff. University professors are the guardians of a country's culture. European, American, and Japanese countries respect and treat them well. In contrast, even according to the conditions for professor treatment promulgated by your ministry, they are already meager. Moreover, those below that level are even more so. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are some who do not have full-time professors, some who have no full-time professors at all, and some who pay salaries based on hourly signatures, with some as low as two yuan per hour. As a result, each professor must teach at several schools to maintain their livelihood, and they also face the fear of unemployment for three or four months each year. How can we expect professors to focus on teaching? Based on the objective environment in Shanghai, the members of this association believe that the following four points should be implemented at a minimum: 1. Full-time professors in each school should account for two-thirds of the total number of professors, with a monthly salary of 200 yuan or more, teaching about ten hours per week, and paid for twelve months per year. A seniority-based salary increase system must be strictly implemented. 2. Part-time professors should not be paid less than four yuan per hour, the system of paying salaries based on hourly signatures should be abolished, and they should be paid for ten full months each year. 3. The shortest contract period for full-time professors should be two years, and the shortest contract period for part-time professors should be one year. 4. School administrative staff should not be easily replaced in order to respect their experience. We request your ministry to instruct all schools to strictly comply with the above four points. 4. Respect academic research. University courses have specialized characteristics, and the courses taught by each professor are those that they have been studying for many years. When universities arrange classes, they often change courses arbitrarily without the consent of the professor, resulting in abandoning strengths and accommodating weaknesses. Year after year, professors are wrongly criticized as being experts in everything, but in reality, teachers are working in vain, and students are not making any progress. This is a sign of the bankruptcy of Chinese university education. We request your ministry to instruct all schools to respect the academic research of each professor. All of these points urgently need to be improved. The members of this association dare to offer their humble opinions and contribute their modest efforts. We humbly ask your ministry to investigate and handle them properly, and we eagerly await your instructions. The Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Association respectfully states. We believe that this matter is of great importance to the nation's culture and is of particular concern to the members of this association. We hope that all members will uphold the spirit of harmony and cooperation and strive to achieve the realization of this minimum improvement. We hereby announce this."</p>

<h3>Professor Zhu Ying of the National Academy of Music Invented the Semitone for the Chinese Flute</h3>
<p>The tone of the Chinese flute is the best among Chinese musical instruments, and it is superior to the Western flute. However, those who are familiar with Western music despise it because it has no semitones and is too simple. Some advocate adding more holes to the flute, but these are not the views of connoisseurs. Mr. Zhu said that according to the ancient Chinese flute, there was a saying of semitones, but later, because Chinese people liked to use the harmonious melody of the eight tones, the semitone playing method was gradually lost, and now it is inexplicable. In view of this, Mr. Zhu has carefully studied and has already found its original semitones. Now, the semitone playing method of the small worker mode of the Chinese flute is explained as follows: When all six holes of the Chinese flute are pressed, it is the He character of the small worker mode. Pressing half of the sixth hole is the high semitone of the He character. Pressing half of the fifth hole and opening the sixth hole is the high semitone of the four characters. Pressing half of the third hole and opening all the holes below the third hole is the high semitone of the Shang character. Pressing half of the second hole and opening all the holes below the second hole is the high semitone of the ruler character. Pressing half of the first hole and opening all the holes below the first hole is the high semitone of the worker character. However, when pressing half a hole, it must be pressed accurately, and the sound must be flawless. In this way, there were originally fourteen high and low notes on the flute, but now, with the addition of five and a half notes, the high and low notes total ten, for a total of twenty-four notes. In addition, there are differences in the use of rhythm between Chinese and Western music. The West uses equal temperament, while China uses unequal temperament. Therefore, there are also two semitones in the accidental notes of Chinese music. This is the special feature of Chinese music using simple melodies. Since the flute is like this, the semitone playing method of the xiao can also be inferred by analogy. Those who are interested in studying music can give it a try.</p>

<h3>Typhoid Fever Expounded (Part 2) (Below)</h3>
<p>— Yu Chouxiu</p>
<p>Those who advocate the theory that typhoid fever transmits through the foot meridians and not the hand meridians. Zhang Zihe's "Mirror of Typhoid Fever" says: "Typhoid fever only transmits through the six foot meridians. Zhongjing's original theory does not mention this, nor have ancient and modern scholars. Only Pang Anchang said that Yang is dominant in growth. Therefore, Foot Taiyang Water transmits to Foot Yangming Earth. Earth transmits to Foot Shaoyang Wood, as a minor evil. Yin is dominant in killing. Therefore, Wood transmits to Foot Taiyin Earth. Earth transmits to Foot Shaoyin Water. Water transmits to Foot Jueyin Wood, as a villainous evil. This is a far-fetched association. Why not look at the Inner Canon's 'Theory of Yin Yang Separation and Combination,' which says: 'The root of Taiyang arises from Zhiyin, named Yin within Yang. The root of Yangming arises from Lidui, named Yin within Yang. The root of Shaoyang arises from Qiaoyin, named Yin within Shaoyang. The root of Taiyin arises from Yinbai, named Yin within Yin. The root of Shaoyin arises from Yongquan, named Yin within Shaoyin. The root of Jueyin arises from Dadun, named Yin of Absolute Yin. The order is exactly in accordance with this.'" This takes the order of the "Theory of Yin Yang Separation and Combination" as the order of typhoid fever meridian transmission. However, the order of the "Theory of Yin Yang Separation and Combination" is also extremely chaotic, with no reason to be found. How can it be used as evidence? Moreover, it only agrees with the foot meridian order, and it does not explain why it only transmits through the foot meridians and not the hand meridians. He criticizes Pang Anchang as a far-fetched association, but is this not a far-fetched association?</p>
<p>It also says, "Examining it with the six qi, Jueyin is the first qi, Shaoyin is the second qi, Taiyin is the third qi, Shaoyang" is the fourth qi, Yangming is the fifth qi, and Taiyang is the final qi. This is the order. To speak of it in reverse, it matches exactly. The reason typhoid fever is a disease is that it is reverse and not in order." This is even more far-fetched. As for Liu Caochuang, he said, "The six foot meridians are repeatedly water, wood, and earth, all of which cannot withstand the injury of cold qi. Therefore, when water encounters cold, it dries up and freezes. When wood encounters cold, the leaves fall and the branches wither. When earth encounters cold, it cracks and is not firm. The hand meridians all belong to metal and fire. Metal and fire are not afraid of cold. Therefore, when metal encounters cold, it becomes firmer, and the fire body is extremely hot, and cold cannot invade," etc. This is entirely based on the theory of the five elements' nature, and it mistakenly believes that typhoid fever is truly a disease caused by cold evil. The unreasonableness and ridiculousness of its argument need not be explicitly stated.</p>
<p>However, Hejian's Official Ming Theory says: "The Theory of Heat also says: The three yin and three yang, the five zang and six fu, all receive illness. The ying and wei do not circulate, and the five zang do not communicate, then death will occur." It never stops at transmitting only through the foot meridians and not the hand meridians.</p>
<p>Tao Jiean said: "Transmitting through the feet and not the hands is a fallacy of the common people. How can this be? A person's entire body is nourished by blood and qi. It circulates day and night, running without ceasing. How can there be a reason to only travel in the feet and not in the hands?..."</p>
<p>"The order of the wind wood begins at the Great Cold solar term　, exactly in the middle of the twelve days. It is only after the vernal equinox that the warm order begins to travel. Therefore, wind and cold can also injure it. Foot Yangming and Taiyin are central earth. It has nothing to do with winter, but it is also injured by typhoid fever. The reason is that earth has no fixed position, no established name, no specialized qi, and is entrusted to the four seasons, able to begin and end all things. Therefore, the qi of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness of the four seasons can all injure it... The six hand meridians are dominant in summer and autumn. Therefore, they are not injured. The six foot meridians are the boundaries for receiving the injury. If one says injury to the feet but not the hands is acceptable. To take it as transmission through the feet and not the hands is not acceptable." This generally means that the disease is received in the foot meridians. After the disease has started, then it transmits everywhere. Although he can know the fallacy of transmitting through the feet and not the hands, the theory of injury to the feet but not the hands that he holds is also based on the five elements and four seasons.</p>
<p>Li Chan's "Medical Entry" also follows Jiean's theory of injury to the feet but not the hands, and his discussion of transmitting through the feet and not the hands says, "In ancient times, there were only three yin and three yang, without distinguishing between hands and feet." It also says, "The three yin of the hands and feet go together to the head and to the feet. The three yin of the hands and feet go together from the feet to the chest and abdomen and to the hands. How can the meridians be the same, yet the diseases received are different?"</p>
<p>Zhang Jingyue wrote the "Classified Canon." His commentary on the "Treatise on Cold and Heat" is based on Li Chan's intention and speaks of it eloquently. He says: "The transmission and transformation of typhoid fever only speak of the foot meridians and not the hand meridians. Its meaning originates from this chapter. How can Liu Caochuang not understand this principle and thus mistakenly create the theory of typhoid fever transmitting through the feet and not the hands, saying that the foot meridians all belong to water, wood, and earth. When water is cold, it freezes. When wood is cold, it withers. When earth is cold, it cracks. All of these cannot withstand the cold. The hand meridians all belong to metal and fire. When metal encounters cold, it becomes firmer. The fire body is extremely hot, and cold cannot invade. Therefore, typhoid fever only transmits through the foot meridians and not the hand meridians. Clever words seek praise, and the ignorant call it wonderful. Exaggerated lies deceive people, and nothing is worse than this. The two treasures of metal and fire in a person are only assigned to the five elements. How can they be real metal and real fire, which cannot be destroyed? Once these words are spoken, they raise doubts. Leading some to say that the foot meridians are below, and the hand meridians are above. Cold is originally yin evil, so it transmits through the feet. Some say that the six foot meridians all bind the qi of the north and the four corners. The six hand meridians are all the qi of the southwest. Cold qi strikes people, inevitably in winter and spring. Similar qi seeks each other, so it starts from the water meridian and then to wood and earth, while metal and fire are not violated. Some say that there is no typhoid fever without the extraordinary meridians. The extraordinary meridians only attach to the feet. Conflicting arguments, arguing unclearly. Their theories are all wrong. A person's blood and qi circulate throughout the body, flowing and not ceasing. How can the evil not enter when it encounters the hand meridians?" This refutes the theory of transmitting through the feet and not the hands. It is based on the theories of Hejian and Jiean and extends them.</p>
<p>Jingyue also says, "However, why does this canon not speak of the hands? Typhoid fever is a surface evil. To seek external evidence, one should observe the entire body. The foot meridians fully cover the entire body's pulse network, both above and below. The hand meridians cannot cover everything. Moreover, the hand meridians cannot reach where the foot meridians do not reach. Therefore, only speaking of the foot meridians, all the left and right, front and back, yin and yang symptoms can be found by pressing. The hand meridians are also included in it. There is no need to speak of them. This is why this canon only focuses on the feet, in order to observe the surface symptoms of the entire body." This clarifies the meaning of the Inner Canon speaking of the feet but not the hands. It is based on Li Chan's theory and speaks of it more clearly. However, the order and arrangement of the twelve meridians, as spoken of in the Inner Canon, are all wrong. This has been detailed in my humble work, "Spiritual Pivot Commentary". Therefore, anything based on the order and arrangement of the meridians is also all wrong. The root is first pulled out.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(3) (10) (1) Tetanus Q: What is tetanus?</p>
<p>A: It is a contagious disease caused by wound infection.</p>
<p>Q: Who discovered the tetanus pathogen, and what is its morphology?</p>
<p>A: It was discovered by Mr. Nicoair. It is a rod-shaped bacterium with a flagellum at one end, capable of slight movement. It has spores at one end that are three to four times larger than the bacterial body.</p>
<p>Q: Where does this pathogen exist?</p>
<p>A: The tetanus pathogen exists in horse manure, cow manure, and soil.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of tetanus in its early stages?</p>
<p>A: After an incubation period of four to fourteen days after infection, the disease begins. The initial symptoms include tension or even stiffness in the jaw, face, and neck. Due to the tonic spasm of the masseter muscle, the upper and lower jaws are tightly clenched, and the mouth cannot be opened. This is called trismus. Afterwards, the rigidity spreads to the facial muscles, resulting in prominent wrinkles on the forehead and a bitter smile on the nasolabial folds. When it spreads to the neck muscles and spinal muscles, the spine curves forward or backward, called opisthotonos. When it spreads to the limbs and torso, the body becomes a stick-like straight line, called erect extension. In addition, there is abdominal wall depression, like a hard board. There are also cases where the intercostal muscles become rigid, resulting in an inspiratory position.</p>
<p>Q: Besides these symptoms, what are the other main symptoms?</p>
<p>A: In addition to these rigid muscle symptoms, there is also an increase in the excitability of the nervous system. Therefore, when encountering some minor stimuli, such as light, wind, noise, or body shaking, painful spasms occur.</p>
<p>Q: Is skin sensation affected?</p>
<p>A: Skin sensation is completely normal; however, reflex excitability is increased, and the secretion of sweat and tears is also increased.</p>
<p>Q: What are the patient's body temperature, pulse, and breathing like?</p>
<p>A: Body temperature rises slightly in the early stages. After the onset of spasms, high fever begins. The pulse is rapid, and breathing is difficult.</p>
<p>Q: What about urination and defecation?</p>
<p>A: Both urination and defecation are reduced.</p>
<p>Q: How long does this disease last?</p>
<p>A: It usually lasts one or two weeks, but some are faster, and some are slower.</p>
<p>Q: How dangerous is tetanus?</p>
<p>A: The shorter the incubation period, the more dangerous it is. The mortality rate is 60% to 90%.</p>
<p>Q: What is the treatment for tetanus?</p>
<p>A: The wound is cut open or removed. Sometimes, the diseased limb must be amputated. In the early stages, 100 units of tetanus antitoxin can be injected into the muscles near the wound or subcutaneously in the chest. It can also be injected intravenously or into the spine. When spasms occur, magnesium sulfate solution is injected into the spinal cord or intravenously, or it can be injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. In addition, sedatives such as potassium bromide "I, uminal" and hydrated　aldehyde are taken internally.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Trachoma</h3>
<p>— Shen Kangbai</p>
<p>Q: What is trachoma?</p>
<p>A: Trachoma is a highly contagious, extremely difficult-to-cure, and prevalent eye disease.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of trachoma?</p>
<p>A: Initially, there is photophobia, tearing, adhesion of the upper and lower eyelids, sometimes slight pain, blurred vision, and the conjunctiva is covered with granules or thorns. Over time, the conjunctival tissue overgrows and constricts, and the eyelid opening becomes smaller than usual.</p>
<p>Q: Why does trachoma cause blurred vision?</p>
<p>A: One reason is that the cornea grows blood vessel-like tissue resembling glue, called corneal pannus, which obscures the cornea. The other reason is corneal ulceration, resulting in corneal scarring. Slight upward and downward movement of the eyelids causes the granules and thorns to rub against the eyeball, producing a glue-like tear fluid, resulting in blurred vision.</p>
<p>Q: What are the routes of trachoma transmission?</p>
<p>A: The pathogen of trachoma is still unknown. The routes of transmission are generally from people who have trachoma and do not take precautions, with several people using the same towel and basin, resulting in transmission. Therefore, bathhouses, hotels, military camps, schools, tea houses, and wine shops are all sources of transmission of this disease. Public gambling tools are also a source of transmission of this disease.</p>
<p>Q: What are the consequences of neglecting to treat trachoma?</p>
<p>A: Early treatment of this disease is generally harmless. If treatment is delayed, the face gradually changes shape, corneal ulcers or pannus develops, and the eyelashes become inverted, irritating the cornea, ultimately leading to blindness.</p>
<p>Q: How can trachoma be prevented?</p>
<p>A: Wash your eyes with boric acid water frequently, avoid walking on dusty ground, regulate your diet, go to bed early and get up early, breathe fresh air, exercise regularly, and use your own towels and basins. It is better to discard public ones rather than use them. Even when traveling to other places, you should bring your own towels and basins to avoid infection. Gambling is particularly easy to transmit this disease, and mahjong is even worse. Because many people are crowded together, and they touch the tiles with their hands, it is inevitable that this disease will spread. If you wash your hands with disinfectant soap every day, it is more reliable for prevention.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Vegetarianism</h3>
<p>— Miller</p>
<p>Dr. Miller, director of the Shanghai Sanitarium and Health Hospital, gave a speech on the American Chinese radio station on the 3rd of this month, titled "The Benefits of Vegetarianism." The reasons for advocating vegetarianism are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All the nutrients the body needs are available in vegetables, fruits, and grains. Meat is an indirect food, and the nutrients it contains all come from plants, and they are incomplete. Vegetables contain minerals and vitamins that are extremely lacking in meat. Therefore, vegetarianism is better.</p>
<p>(2) Meat often contains various germs and waste and juices that are bound to exist in animal bodies, which are extremely harmful to the human body. Meat-eaters are most prone to malignant tumors, skin diseases, liver toxicity, cervical gland swelling, kidney stones, hardening of blood vessels, gout, and various gastrointestinal diseases. Vegetarians do not have this kind of danger, because vegetables are not a breeding ground for toxic bacteria.</p>
<p>(3) Vegetables and grains are easier to digest than meat. The raw materials they contain begin to digest when chewed in the mouth, so the more you chew, the sweeter they taste. Meat is the opposite. The ingredients it contains cannot be digested in the mouth, so the more you chew, the more bland and tasteless it becomes.</p>
<p>(4) Meat eaters are prone to liver and kidney problems. The liver and kidneys are responsible for digesting protein and removing waste. Meat contains a lot of protein and not enough other nutrients, and it also contains a lot of waste. Therefore, it easily overburdens the liver and kidneys, causing damage.</p>
<p>(5) Livestock eats eight pounds of vegetables and grains to grow one pound of meat, but one pound of vegetables contains three times more nutrients than one pound of meat. Therefore, the nutrients in meat are 25 times more expensive than the nutrients in vegetables.</p>
<p>(6) Meat is more prone to spoilage than vegetables. Spoiled meat is more harmful to the human body than spoiled vegetables, and it is more difficult to detect spoiled meat than spoiled vegetables. Therefore, to avoid danger, it is better to abstain from meat, especially in summer.</p>
<p>(7) Meat, because it contains toxic juices and waste, easily makes people feel irritable and sleepy. Vegetarians are definitely stronger and longer-lived than meat eaters. This is an indisputable fact.</p>
<p>(8) The most commendable point about meat is its delicious taste, but a person's taste is just a habit. In fact, all the flavors of meat can be found in vegetables, it just depends on whether the seasoning is appropriate.</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the major and important points. Vegetarianism is enough to give people a clean and hygienic feeling, a pleasant body and mind, agile thinking, and a strong resistance to disease, which is another matter.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(2) Nosebleeds</p>
<p>When we talk about the two words "nosebleed," it refers to bleeding from the nose. In medicine, it is called Epistaxis. Everyone, regardless of gender, age, or status, has the opportunity to encounter it. Because it is easy to cure, everyone does not treat it as a big deal. If the bleeding does not stop for two or three days, then they will consult a doctor. Chinese families generally believe that the way to stop bleeding is to dip paper or cotton wool in old ink and insert it into the nasal cavity. The reason for stopping bleeding is said to be that the raw material of ink is made from a mixture of pine soot and colloid. Pine soot contains carbon, which can promote blood coagulation. Colloid is rich in viscosity, like the Western medicine Gelatine, which has a blood-clotting effect. In rural areas, when there is a nosebleed, they mostly do not use ink to stop the bleeding, but only use grass paper or plant leaves to stuff the nostrils. Sometimes it can also work. However, often using the above-mentioned treatment method still cannot stop the bleeding, or it often recurs. What is the reason for this? I will now explain the reasons clearly. Please listen. When we talk about nosebleeds from a medical perspective, we must first know the causes, whether they are local or systemic. The treatment goals also differ accordingly, which is to first stop the bleeding (treating the symptoms), and second, to find the root and source and search for the causes (treating the root cause). I will now write the local causes on the left.</p>
<p>(1) Traumatic nosebleeds Belonging to this category of nosebleeds, (1) comes from the use of external force to hit the nose when falling down, causing direct or indirect damage to the nasal mucosa and bleeding. (2) Naughty children often have a habit of scratching their nostrils with their fingernails. This habit easily causes the nasal mucosa to be repeatedly stimulated by external force, turning the stimulation into a small wound surface and bleeding. (3) When performing surgery in the nasal cavity, traumatic nosebleeds often occur. This is the doctor's responsibility. There is also a type of traumatic nosebleed that also comes from surgery, which is (4) in the Jiangbei area, because they value their children, they drill a hole in the front of the nasal septum in the middle of the nostril. (The nasal septum is a piece of bone that separates the nasal cavity into two nostrils. The front is cartilage, and the back is hard bone). Put on a circle. At this time, a nosebleed is of course inevitable.</p>
<p>(2) Nosebleeds caused by local lesions in the nasal cavity (1) When suffering from dry anterior rhinitis, the surface of the mucous membrane in the front part of the nasal septum is often attached with viscous liquid. Inhaling dust easily dries it and forms scabs. There is a feeling of itching and dryness in the nose, so people often scratch their nostrils with their fingers, peeling off the scabs and causing nosebleeds. This disease is more likely to occur in plasterers, miners, and chemical factory workers. (2) The area where nosebleeds are prone to occur in local lesions is Kieseldach's area. This area is located on the cartilage at the front end of the nasal septum. The mucous membrane here is very thin, and there are many dilated capillaries. When encountering slight damage or increased blood pressure, these capillaries are easily ruptured and bleed. The above-mentioned (1) and (2) bleeding also occurs most frequently in this area. When we doctors encounter patients with nosebleeds, the first important place to check is this area. The reason why ordinary people use cotton wool dipped in old ink or just use cotton wool to stuff the front of the nostrils can stop the bleeding is also because this area is most prone to bleeding. Therefore, I can call this area the nosebleed spring.</p>
<p>(3) Nosebleeds caused by tumors in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or nasopharynx. Such as cancer, sarcoma, nasopharyngeal fibroma, or bleeding nasal septum polyps, etc., are prone to nosebleeds. The nosebleeds mentioned above are all from local causes. Now I will talk about systemic causes. The so-called systemic causes are caused by systemic diseases. For example, diseases with changes in the blood vessel walls or diseases with increased blood pressure can easily cause nosebleeds. I will now list the diseases with these changes on the left. The detailed symptoms of each disease will not be discussed.</p>
<p>(1) Diseases of the blood and hematopoietic organs, such as anemia, chlorosis, pernicious anemia, leukemia, and pseudoleukemia, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Infectious diseases, such as nasal diphtheria, intestinal typhus, recurring fever, scarlet fever, measles, chickenpox, malignant malaria, purulent diseases, and inherited syphilis, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Hemorrhagic diseases, such as scurvy, hemophilia, purpura, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Poisoning, such as phosphorus poisoning, acute yellow liver atrophy, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Diseases with decreased blood pressure, such as arteriosclerosis, nephritis, atrophic kidney, etc.</p>
<p>(6) Heart diseases (such as aortic valve insufficiency), lung diseases (such as emphysema), severe cough (such as whooping cough), and plethora, etc.</p>
<p>There is also a so-called compensatory nosebleed, which refers to compensatory menstruation. It is commonly called reversed menstruation. That is, when menstruation comes, there is a large amount of nosebleeds. At this time, menstruation is less or even absent. The reason is still unknown.</p>
<p>The symptoms of nosebleeds and their prevention and first aid methods will be continued in the next issue. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (8)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The Progression of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(3) The third type is the spread through the vascular system. A common result of lymphatic gland tuberculosis is the discovery of calcified degeneration. In this case, its progression naturally ceases. However, if this is not the case, it will naturally spread through other routes. We must understand that the end of ordinary lymphatic vessels is close to veins. Therefore, the invasion of tubercle bacilli is very likely to spread to the venous vascular system at this time. As a result, arteries are inevitably involved. This route is likely due to lymphatic tuberculosis becoming caseous, transferring through the thoracic duct, invading the bloodstream, and then spreading to the whole body. If there are too many tubercle bacilli in the blood, acute miliary tuberculosis will occur. In the medical community, this disease is greatly feared and almost always leads to death within a few weeks. However, if the number of tubercle bacilli invading the bloodstream is not very large, and the patient's body has considerable resistance, the result is the development of localized tuberculous lesions in any organ. There are many obvious examples in organs such as the kidneys, adrenal glands, brain, spinal cord, epididymis, and ovaries. The process of its formation is generally due to tubercle bacilli entering the blood system, resulting in a large nodule in the organ, which then slowly develops symptoms in the organ. However, it is sometimes impossible to determine through autopsy which lymphatic gland the invasion of the blood vessels originated from, or where the initial lesion was located.</p>
<p>Finally, there is another issue that should be addressed. Is the formation of pulmonary tuberculosis progressive through the ductal system, similar to kidney tuberculosis? This situation is also possible. We must understand that caseous degeneration of the lymph nodes in the pulmonary hilum can infect other nearby branches of the trachea, thereby reaching all other branches. From there, tuberculous caseous degeneration also forms on the tracheal mucosa, and the tissues near the tracheal branches and alveoli also show signs of infiltration. As a result, there are several types of lesions of varying sizes in the lungs, and even the area of infiltration can be equal to the size of an entire lobe of the lung, with each lesion exhibiting caseous degeneration and softening. The result of this type of pulmonary tuberculosis can be the formation of cavities, which then turn into open pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<h3>Ginseng (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Juhuang</p>
<p>Characteristics: Ginseng is distinguished by whether it is cultivated or wild, by the length of time it has grown, and by differences in origin and preparation, which determine its color and quality. There are many names, too numerous to list.</p>

<p>Nikko Ginseng (produced in Japan)</p>
<p>American Ginseng (produced in the United States and Canada) Wild Skin American Ginseng Powdered American Ginseng</p>
<p>Domestically produced ginseng is most valued when it grows in the mountains and fields (mountain ginseng), is large in size, and resembles the shape of a human. It commonly has various shapes. It is approximately 20 to 30 centimeters long and 0.5 to 1.0 centimeters in diameter. The length of the branch roots is approximately 10 to 20 centimeters, with a diameter of 0.4 to 0.6 centimeters. The cork layer is mostly removed, and it is white with a slight yellow tint. The main root is round or spindle-shaped, often forked into two or three branches. The fibrous roots attached to the main body are not removed at all. A distinctive feature of this product is the presence of dry stem buds at the top of the root, based on the rhizome, forming a tangled mass. Older ones have more branches and are thinner and longer. In the ginseng market, this is called the "Lutou" (sprout). It is specially preserved during ginseng preparation as proof of deep roots. The entire main root has fine horizontal lines, which are more pronounced near the top. The branch roots often have longitudinal wrinkles and leave traces of branch roots or fibrous roots that have been broken off. The tips of the roots are often reddish-yellow and semi-transparent, which is the growing point of the root cap. The cross-section is circular or elliptical, with curved edges forming a wavy pattern. What can be identified with the naked eye is the yellowish-brown shape or concentric rings, dividing the cortex and the central cylinder, which is what the old herbal texts call the "Jing" (central stem) and "Yulan" (cortex). The central cylinder shows vascular bundles or radial纹理, which ginseng merchants call the "Chrysanthemum pattern." It is hard and brittle, with a flat fracture surface, a sweet taste with a slight bitter pungency, and a unique fresh fragrance. (The above refers to the most valuable domestic product, Jilin wild mountain ginseng.)</p>
<p>Oriental ginseng is ginseng transplanted from Korea, or cultivated in Japan using seeds of ginseng originally from the eastern provinces of our country (the so-called "Imperial Seed Ginseng"). This product is divided into two types. One type is harvested for its roots, with the fibrous roots and outer skin removed and dried, which is called white ginseng. The one processed with steam is called red ginseng. White ginseng is yellowish-white, usually about 15 to 20 centimeters long, 1.0 to 2.5 centimeters in diameter, and the branch roots are 0.3 to 0.6 centimeters. It is generally spindle-shaped and may also be branched in the shape of a human. The root head has the remains of the stem base, as well as scars left after branch roots and fibrous roots have been broken off. This is largely similar to ordinary cultivated products in China, except that the peeled part of the Oriental ginseng's outer skin is very deep, and the fibrous roots are completely removed. The surface only has straight, coarse wrinkles, with very few horizontal lines, which is the major difference.</p>

<h3>On Dreams</h3>
<p>— Yu Tu</p>
<p>If there is anything in life that can be called happiness, I think it must be dreams! In dreams, all the desires of life will be satisfied, whether they are shocking or joyful stimuli, you always have these demands.</p>
<p>Killing or being killed in dreams is a common occurrence, just as in life, if you don't kill, you will be killed. However, it is expressed a little differently, that is, what you want to kill but are unable to kill will make you actually kill him. It's in the dream! It is because of this mystery that you are satisfied and cheered.</p>
<p>In real life, it is often neither dead nor alive, as if being slowly slaughtered, which is a common feeling for those who curse reality but lack the courage to resist. But dreams can give you courage and actually allow you to compete with it. Even if you are eventually caught due to insufficient strength and cut in two, you can still enjoy the pleasure!</p>
<p>Dreams will help you complete these happinesses that cannot be obtained in the human world.</p>
<p>Religious figures often advise people to believe in God, saying that sincere prayer will lead to salvation and entry into heaven. I think this is unnecessary, because our dreams often take us there! Aren't they creating some kind of hell to scare us? In fact, the hell in mythology is just a kind of satirical writing played by advanced and intelligent ancestors who were forced by the tyranny of the time and could not tell the truth. It is possible that we, the ignorant people, are not good at understanding and then create a superstitious mentality.</p>
<p>In dreams, you will get all the explanations; in dreams, you will also get all the liberation. Those things that seem unreachable can be obtained in dreams!</p>
<p>"Floating life is like a dream," since living is still a dream, why don't we really dream?</p>
<h3>By the River Duer (Continued) (End)</h3>
<p>— Lao Bai</p>
<p>My eyes were dizzy, and pain occupied intoxication. I felt tasteless, and I felt sorrow. Suddenly, the grass on the ground and Qi Jun's feet turned into many withered yellow skeletons, and those skeletons were running towards the distant tomb. Terror and pain occupied me, and I couldn't bear to let a young person follow those skeletons to the tomb. I knew this would only destroy him; it would not make him new. So, with painful tears, I couldn't help but call out to Qi Jun;</p>
<p>"Qi Jun, you can't perish! You are still young... You need to work hard to do your career. ... The path of wasting youth can only make you die; Qi, do you really want to waste it until death? ... Qi! You should walk a path that you should walk!"</p>
<p>"What?......" Qi Jun rushed to my front, "Bai, are you crazy? Why do you want to say such crazy words?"</p>
<p>"I'm not crazy! ......" I quickly stood up, "Qi, really! I feel very sorry for you. I think it's a very pity that you waste your useful youth in enjoyment!"</p>
<p>Qi Jun did not answer me with any words. He smiled and walked to my side, and then moved me back to sit under the coconut tree.</p>
<p>"Are you never going to work in your life?......" I said to Qi Jun in distress.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>"I want you not to waste your youth. You should do something; do our great cause of fighting for freedom!... Qi, do you understand?</p>
<p>Qi Jun did not say a word. He lowered his head, as if thinking about something.</p>
<p>The wind at the end of March was still a bit cool. The coconut trees were blown and rustled. We seemed to be intoxicated in a poetic realm, but we did not need this poetic emotion to mourn. I was very sad in my heart, as if I was having a painful dream.</p>
<p>"Bai, ......" Qi Jun suddenly called my name like this, "You're right; it's the most painful thing for a person to have no freedom and no love."</p>
<p>"Then you should work hard."</p>
<p>"I work hard?... ..." Qi Jun gave a cold laugh, "I feel that I have no possibility of working hard at all, because I myself have not lost my freedom."</p>
<p>"Qi Jun! ......" I raised my voice again and called out his name, "Are you really going to be anesthetized like this?"</p>
<p>"Anesthesia?... ..." Qi Jun muttered to himself in a subtle way. He seemed to grab his hair, and suddenly the smooth hair that grew on his head was also messed up by him. So he actually cried! He said with a sad tone:</p>
<p>"Bai, ... ...... I... ...... I woke up!"</p>
<p>I drew out my palm and held Qi Jun's palm even tighter. I was so happy that I shed tears. A kind of light flashed in Qi Jun's eyes, and he said sadly:</p>
<p>"This time in Cairo, I found many people who had lost their freedom and lost their love! ... ...... ... This is a true story: The people of Egypt have no freedom at all. They live a life of being oppressed and exploited; although they have made several resistances, the result is only that a few people have been killed in vain. This time I came here. It is because I can't bear to see that kind of unfree life!"</p>
<p>"Qi, ......" I patted his shoulder with my hand, "I think that probably not only Egypt is unfree in the world."</p>
<p>"Of course, ... ...," Qi Jun said frankly, "There are more and more unfree people."</p>
<p>"Are there any other strange things in Cairo?......" My words went far again.</p>
<p>"Nothing else. What I still remember very clearly is a puppy I lost in Cairo. ......" Qi Jun began to talk about his story in Egypt again: "That dog is really good! His name is Columbus. He is the smartest and most clever dog among the dogs. Every day I have to take Columbus out. I took him to the dance hall, I took him to the cinema, and I also took him to the famous Pyramid to play. There is no place I didn't take him to. He enjoyed unlimited happiness. Many people are not as lucky as Columbus, because the world is still full of hungry people who can't even eat bread. But my dog has never worried about bread,... ... What I eat, Columbus eats too.</p>
<p>"Columbus is very brave! ... ... I remember one day: when a beggar ran to my residence, he actually begged Columbus, he begged Columbus and said:</p>
<p>"Our dog lord! Please show your mercy! I'm really too hungry to bear it! Give me some milk and some beef to eat!"</p>
<p>"But my Columbus cleverly ran in front of the beggar and barked wildly. He even chased after him and tore a few pieces of the beggar's clothes; the beggar did not resist, and he finally left cowardly!" Qi Jun seemed very sad when he said this, and he said with a painful tone:</p>
<p>"Alas, this is the past! ... ... I feel that my past is sinful and cruel! ... ...... That's not a human life, it's simply living a devil's life!"</p>
<p>"Is there only this one story about dogs..." I asked Qi Jun.</p>
<p>"No, ......" Qi Jun said sadly. "Bai, please forgive me for not being able to say any more! Because I can't bear to mention the past anymore!"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything. I saw Qi Jun shedding tears alone. This riverbank was full of quiet and strict air.</p>
<p>The wind at the end of March was blowing the coconut trees. A few round leaves were blown down on our bodies. I casually picked up one and stared at it blankly.</p>

<h3>"Special Issue on Chinese Literature Research"</h3>
<p>— Wen Muzhai</p>
<p>In the past, almost all magazines of a literary nature have published special issues on Chinese literature, but that's about it. I have thought that a special issue on Chinese literature can and cannot be published. Because there are already so many monographs on Chinese literature that it is not easy to count them. Why bother to collect odd scraps and compile them into a "special issue"? However, precisely because there are so many special issues like this, another form of special issue on Chinese literature is possible and necessary. To publish a special issue on Chinese literature is not to promote and praise the past Chinese literature, but to provide at least a special and fresh question about Chinese literature. This issue of "Literature" meets this prerequisite.</p>
<p>The special issue includes four forums, thirty papers, and three book reviews. The first article, "Where Are Chinese Literature Researchers Going?" by Yuan Jun, points out that "we should seek a new path in new themes and new methods," thereby re-evaluating the value of Chinese literature, which is to reconstruct the history of Chinese literature. Zheng Zhenduo's "A Brief History of the Discovery of New Materials in Chinese Literature in the Past Thirty Years" provides a general description of the discovery of new themes. In addition, there are many works studying Chinese language, writing, phonology, music, and rhythm, such as Wei Jiangong's "The Posture of Pure Chinese Literature and the Chinese Language," Liu Bannong's "Huang Jie's Interpretation of the Ancient Music Chapter of the Lüshi Chunqiu," Guo Shaoyu's "Alliteration and Assonance in Chinese Poetry," and Wu Wenqi's "On the Simplification of Writing," which are generally ignored. To fully meet what Yuan Jun pointed out, it is naturally difficult to expect a single special issue, and at the beginning.</p>
<p>But there is one point, that is, Yu Pingbo's "Zuo Zhuan Encounters" is just a reading note, to be clear, it is a kind of reading scripture note or reading history note, but it is not a special work on Chinese literature research. It seems a little "inappropriate" to put it in this special issue. Because this contradicts the purpose of overturning traditional literary concepts.</p>
<h3>The Prevalence of Magazines and the Decline of Standalone Books</h3>
<p>— Chuan Hongliao</p>
<p>In the "Literary Outlook" section of the June issue of "Modern," the editor raised an important question: "The Prevalence of Literary Magazines and the Decline of Standalone Books in 1934." The point is: "Standalone books are too expensive, while magazines are cheaper, and the quality is equal. Therefore, in times of low social economy and weak purchasing power of readers, this is a dangerous situation, and it is a problem for the entire literary world. To remedy this dangerous situation, the only way is to reduce the price of standalone books."</p>
<p>This kind of careful attention is indeed admirable, and the theory is also quite pertinent; however, after careful study, it seems that this view is still incomplete. I think that this phenomenon of deformed development is still a problem for some writers themselves.</p>
<p>The prevalence of magazines and the decline of standalone books is of course due to the poor social economy and readers avoiding the heavy and taking the light in economics, but the content of magazines and standalone books is also an important key. After readers have been greatly deceived by the empty content of standalone books, they have become suspicious of general unreliable writers, and when their desire to read has not been completely destroyed, they can only find their way to magazines. There, there are a large number of authors and works. They can: when they are disappointed in Author A, they can seek compensation from Author B. Standalone books cannot be so convenient. Therefore, standalone books are declining day by day.</p>
<p>"Why are there so few standalone books with substantial content?" The crux of this question is: Some writers, due to the lack of life experience, anemia has spread to many people, and they really can't write amazing works; but royalties can't be skipped, life can't be maintained, or even lovers can't be avoided, dancing can't be missed, and as a result, they can only give boring things to the bookstore owner to make up the numbers and publish a book. Under such circumstances, should standalone books slowly decline!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the May Fourth Movement, almost all readers were like blind people, just blindly following behind the authors. But now the times have progressed, and readers can still slightly distinguish between right and wrong; the tricks that used to be played are gradually no longer sensational, and some old roles hanging up their signs are gradually losing their appeal. However, the bookstore owners or magazine editors have not changed their minds about worshiping old roles; and readers are always looking forward to the emergence of new roles. Under this contradiction, the result is that the signs of old roles are still hung up, and the plays are still sung, but in front of the stage door, the audience is reluctant to move forward and slowly slips into the "Amusement Park" or the "Great World." Here we feel that the "Amusement Park" and the "Great World" are very similar to magazines, while the "stage" that hangs the signs of old roles is a standalone book.</p>
<p>There is still more, there is still more... I don't want to list more here.</p>
<p>The prevalence of magazines and the decline of standalone books is not just a simple matter of price. I think it is at least a problem for the writers themselves! Who can guarantee it? If the content of magazines also tends to be superficial and empty, like the standalone books in front of you, its decline may be even more severe!</p>
<p>This phenomenon, according to the conclusion, is: "On the one hand, the progress of readers, and on the other hand, the regression of writers," This is a problem for the entire literary world, a problem for the writers themselves. To block this dangerous tendency, this extension of decadence, we must first examine ourselves, be careful in writing, and more importantly, enrich ourselves, and then there will be satisfactory works for progressive readers!</p>
<p>The prevalence of magazines and the decline of standalone books is a loud warning to the sleeping writers!</p>
<h3>Fire Disaster (6)</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>So we walked back via a closer path. On the way, suddenly Mr. Zhang said anxiously:</p>
<p>"This wind is frightening. If there is a fire, it won't be a joke. Now the tide is low, and if a fire breaks out, and the wind is blowing, there will be no water to put it out."</p>
<p>These words startled me, "Why bring up such a thing at this time?" I looked at my friend's face; he was lost in thought, as if a real fire would break out. I asked:</p>
<p>"Friend, what is bothering you so much?"</p>
<p>"Yi Sheng, you don't know," he said, with a slight tremble in his voice, "Recently, there have been several fires, said to be the schemes of bankrupt merchants. They start fires, hoping to avoid the responsibility of commercial crisis. It's naturally beneficial to those who are about to or have already gone bankrupt, but for me, if a fire breaks out, the losses would be considerable! Three weeks ago, the Singapore Guanglong Company heard that the local branch had successively insured against fire, thinking the opportunity had come. Yi Sheng, you know, this port has never had a fire before; and we old overseas Chinese only care about the present and not the future, you know that bad habit, right? So, as soon as Guanglong Company heard the news, they telegraphed me to quickly get fire insurance as well. Of course, I followed their instructions. But the procedures are very troublesome; the head office has to send someone to investigate, and after the investigation is complete, the insurance policy has to be issued by the Batavia (11) head office, and then sent to the Medan branch. Now the investigation of our business has been completed, but the insurance policy has not yet arrived. Imagine, if there is a fire in the next few days, wouldn't that be terrible?"</p>
<p>"That's unlikely," I comforted him, "Before, this place was full of 'atap厝' type of flammable leaves, and there has never been a fire; is it possible that now that it has been replaced with tile houses, it's not safe? And it's not that coincidental that a mess would break out in the next few days! After a few days, when the insurance policy arrives, wouldn't you be afraid of anything?"</p>
<p>"However, Yi Sheng, your time in the business world is almost zero, you have too little experience! The past is different from the present; opportunities cannot be slowly considered!" he said firmly. On the young man's face, the worried expression of an old man surfaced. That evening, the banquet was not cheerful. The wind outside was stronger, and the host was silent and spoke less. Champagne was opened, but there wasn't the wild drinking like these young people during the New Year. There was laughter, but it wasn't very lively. Only a few "wawas" (12), these idlers who do nothing all day and specialize in wandering around, were very energetic. They tried their best to provoke laughter and encouraged everyone to drink. Because I was a guest, I was a little tipsy; but because there was a shadow in my heart, drinking this wine felt a bit bitter.</p>
<p>(Note 11) Batavia is on the island of Java, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, where the Governor-General of the Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia resides.</p>
<p>(Note 12) In Malay, "wawa" means young master; later, the overseas Chinese also called local-born Chinese men "wawa."</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu Tao: Please come to the Free Talk Editorial Department for a talk between 2 PM and 4 PM this afternoon or tomorrow. Zhang Zisheng</p>

<h3>Optimism and Crisis in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>These days, friends who love to drink tea are placing fragrant or intense green tea or black tea on their desks, judging the color as new. Large quantities of products from various places have once again poured into the major markets of Shanghai and Hankou, and Chinese and foreign merchants are busy discussing prices. Farmers in the interior have made the first batch of spring tea and are preparing to continue rushing to make summer tea in order to obtain more cash. Even the money industry is following the hustle and bustle of the tea market, busy with remittance and cash exchange.</p>
<p>The economic depression in various industries this year is more widespread, profound, and severe than in the past. The overseas silk market continues to report declines, and the price of new cocoons is so low that it is less than twenty silver dollars per picul, not even covering the cost of mulberry leaves. Now is the time when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet available, and as usual, the price of food should continue to rise, but instead, it is trending downward every day. The yarn mills that are reducing production thought that they could make a slight shift due to the stimulus of the American drought, but the news came that they were still preparing to continue reducing production. Even the volume of import and export trade and the operating conditions of large and small shops are all shrinking. Almost nothing can escape the severe world economic panic. While the imperialists are actively trying to shift their panic to semi-colonial China, the tea industry seems to be an exception. This seems to be a miracle in modern Chinese industry!</p>
<p>The total export volume of tea in 1933 increased by 8% compared to 1932 (693,810 piculs in 1933 and 653,888 piculs in 1932). In the past five months of this year, it has increased by 30% compared to last year (according to inspection reports from Shanghai and Hankou, it was 97 in January-May last year, and it has reached 136.86 in the same period this year). Although this year is due to the export of more than 50,000 metric tons of brick tea by Soviet Russia in April; however, the export of black and green tea in Shanghai has also slightly increased, which cannot but make people feel quite optimistic. And the market price of tea overseas is higher than in the past, or at least it can stand firm without much change. Therefore, last year, in addition to Keemun and Ningzhou black tea, Tunxi Pingshui green tea, and low-grade red tea from Lianghu and Wenzhou, all earned a lot of profit.</p>
<p>This year, the Zhenmei green tea from Sui'an and other places, as usual, arrived in Shanghai the earliest and opened the market first. Although the price was very good, it was not lower than last year; and the red tea from Hunan Xiangtan, Zhejiang Wenzhou, and Jiangxi Hekou, which had not attracted much attention for a long time, were scrambled for by various foreign firms, and the prices offered could generally satisfy the sellers. Since January, prices have remained firm. The top price of Keemun black tea reached 210 yuan after arriving in Shanghai. Compared with last year's newly issued city scales, the selling price has increased by 20%. The Ningzhou black tea this year is of very good quality, and the price is also higher than in previous years. The opening market price of Tunxi Zhenmei, Shaoxing Pingshui and other green teas was not lower than last year either. Although this more optimistic new tea market in the past month may not guarantee smooth sailing in the future, on the whole, the demand for low-grade red tea will be more active than last year, and its market price will not necessarily decline much. Recently, the demand and market price of flower-scented tea (i.e., tea dust and tea flakes) have also broken the records of the past ten years. Therefore, as long as the market price of various red and green teas does not decline too much in the future, this year's tea market will definitely be quite satisfactory. This is undoubtedly the case.</p>
<p>Why have low-grade red teas been so active in the past two years? Why has the market for red and green tea not changed much, but has instead shown an increasing trend? The most important reason is that countries such as India, Ceylon, and Java have implemented production restriction agreements. The second reason is that the value of currencies in the United States and the United Kingdom has depreciated, and the cost of living index in these countries has increased (and the increase has been greater after the implementation of the second five-year plan in the Soviet Union). The third reason is that the African natives who sell our green tea are not as affected by the world economic panic as the capitalist countries.</p>
<p>India, Ceylon, Java and other countries are known for producing black tea. In the past three to five years, in view of the decline in the national foreign tea market, they have simultaneously reduced the output of each country's exports by 15% since last year, totaling a reduction of 120 million pounds. Since its implementation last year, the inventory in Europe and the United States has been significantly reduced, and the market price has also increased accordingly. At the same time, due to their restrictions on export volume and increase in tea prices, China's low-grade and cheap red teas from Lianghu, Wenzhou, and Hekou have become active. In addition, due to the increase in the cost of living index in the United States and the United Kingdom, the sales in Africa have not changed, and the market price of red and green tea can continue to be maintained. At the same time, the flower-scented tea, which is the raw material for brick tea, has stimulated other foreign firms to collect it due to the demand from Russian firms, and the price has also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>In this way, can China's tea industry be uniquely lucky? Can we really be optimistic? Can the export volume and selling price continue to rise or be maintained permanently? I am afraid no one can say half a yes to that. Pessimism. Panic. In our view, all kinds of hidden worries, past or future, will arrive immediately as soon as a very short period of time passes.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, just take the production restriction agreement of the major black tea producing countries mentioned above. Their term is five years. The restriction last year was 15%, and this year it has been reduced by 2.5%. Moreover, they are trying every means in their own countries and in London to develop and resist the tea industry. Even more serious is Japan, which is China's competitor in green tea. In recent years, they have almost completely plundered China's only green tea customer, Soviet Russia, and have recently invaded Africa and the four northeastern provinces. This year, the Shizuoka Tea Industry Association in Japan hired Chinese tea masters to start trial-producing various teas suitable for sale in Northeast China. In three or two years, it is feared that they will also be taken away by them. Therefore, the large amount of high-grade Keemun black tea sold to the United Kingdom was already declining and could not be revived. Relying solely on the little low-grade black tea left over by others, in the near future, only needs to be a little bit of skill from others, and it will fall without fighting. If the green tea sold to Africa is repeatedly promoted by Japanese tea, it is feared that it will also be greatly affected. If the domestic tea sales in the four northeastern provinces are also affected at the same time, then China's tea exports will only rely on the red and green brick tea monopolized by Russia and a small part of the less important domestic tea. Then what tea industry is there to talk about!</p>
<p>Chinese tea farmers are of course not organized, especially tea merchants in various places. Not only do they have no foresight, but their only purpose is to find ways to sell at high prices and buy low-quality goods from tea farmers. As long as foreigners want to buy it, they don't care what impurities are contained in the tea! This is like people actively building high-speed, airborne, and durable combat aircraft, while we are still inviting Zhang Tianshi to chant spells and draw symbols to drive away evil spirits. The result must be failure and conquest, which is an undoubted fact.</p>
<p>Isn't there a loud call for the revival of rural areas, the control of the cotton industry, and the silk industry? Isn't it necessary to develop the Northwest because the Northeast has been lost? The ancients said it well: "Without distant thought, there will be near worries." "Anything prepared is established." Because of the excessive import of cotton, we advocate planting cotton, and because of the decline of silk cocoons, we try to rescue it again. This seems to be a remedy after a loss, and how much has been lost in the end, or even a lot of effort with little success. China's tea industry does not seem to have reached a dead end. I hope those who care about the tea industry will come and add to it quickly. The demand for tea has increased more than before. (Among them, especially pay attention to red and green brick tea, otherwise it will really be too late!</p>
<h3>Export Tea Inspection and Trade</h3>
<p>— Hu Haochuan</p>
<p>The international trade of Chinese tea can be divided into two periods. From the end of the Tang Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty, it was the land transport trade outside the Great Wall. After the Europeans gradually moved east, Mongolia and Tibet became closely attached, and tea gained new demand in the markets of Europe and the Americas, which was the sea transport trade.</p>
<p>In the era of trade outside the Great Wall, there was a policy of half-inspection. The Yuan Dynasty set up a tea monopoly examination office. The main purpose was to suppress smuggling and leakage and increase the efficiency of government operations. At the same time, the examination of tea, such as distinguishing types and identifying authenticity, also had incidental attention. At the beginning of overseas exports, tea was China's unique pride. We were absolutely free to supply, and the requesters accepted without any selection. Since other countries also had mass production and fierce confrontation! The golden age gradually faded the unique color of the day. But our tea has surpassed everything in quality, and the continuation of the grand occasion should have been possible in theory. Fifty years ago, exports reached 2.6 million piculs. Six years before the Republic of China, there was still an average of 1.5 million piculs: among them, 1915 (4th year) was even 2.1 million piculs. After 1918 (7th year), it was almost worse every year.</p>
<p>The reason for the failure must be examined from the tea itself. In fact, there are many shortcomings due to the failure of personnel: the beauty of nature has also been buried and cannot be brought into play. The economic irrationality, the futile operation, and the heavy exploitation of tea houses by intermediaries, such as Keemun black tea, cost more to transport to Jiujiang than Javanese tea to reach the UK. The technology of cultivation and manufacturing cannot be improved day by day. Let's leave these aside for the time being. But let's try to talk about one or two facts about the bad aspects of exports. Tea is made from the buds and leaves of tea plants. Green tea that is not fermented has a natural color. Except for a few special cases, the custom is to use the same coloring. The American sales channel was given to Japan in this way. The quality of tea in the Wenzhou area is still quite passable, but the local tea merchants are becoming more and more depressed.</p>
<p>Wenzhou had a short sales channel due to adulteration. The Oujiang Export Tea Inspection Office was established. The director, Huang Wenzhong, had been in office for a long time and achieved considerable results. But this is a temporary local organization, and the inspection is too simple. Recently, after the establishment of commodity inspection bureaus in various places, Shanghai and Hankou have started exporting tea inspection one after another, which has been three years. In the beginning, a very small number of ignorant merchants opposed it, saying that this would inevitably harm merchants. Although this is a past event, there is no need to discuss it in depth: but inspection is a policy to promote trade, which can be seen by the general public who have failed to understand it. Some more progressive commentators said this: The revival of the tea industry should focus on the path of cultivation and manufacturing improvement; inspection starts with the finished product of tea, giving up the root and chasing the root, which is inevitably futile and useless. This is also a statement that does not know the function of inspection. Production improvement is certainly important; finished product inspection is also one of the means to promote production improvement. Originally, the implementation of inspection can at least achieve the following four effects: 丨</p>
<p>(A) Formulate standards for export tea types The distribution and sale of tea types overseas has always been entirely based on the free sale of merchants. Profiteering merchants only seek to unreasonably reduce costs and ignore the improvement of quality. The supply of the market is unregulated. The implementation of inspection first stipulates the "minimum standard tea sample" so that all parties involved in production and sales have a clear basis.</p>
<p>(B) Prohibition of the export of inferior tea types Those that do not meet the "minimum standard" will not be qualified under inspection and will be prohibited from export. This standard is not limited to natural quality. In terms of artificial aspects, there are also nine more important points:</p>
<p>One: Rough and sloppy Manufacturing is not refined, that is, this situation, using shape as the standard.</p>
<p>One: Mixed Due to careless procedures during the harvesting and production process, this is inevitable.</p>
<p>One: Adulteration Ignorant producers occasionally mix in aged tea or fake tea.</p>
<p>One: Deterioration Due to careless manufacturing, storage, and packaging, the beauty of nature is damaged.</p>
<p>One: Coloring Natural colors can be maintained by manufacturing; one should not beg for pigments.</p>
<p>(C) Promoting the improvement of tea type production Inspection standards are becoming higher and higher every year. Production must adapt accordingly, which can gradually lead to the effect of improvement: 丨丨</p>
<p>One: Improve cultivation to seek natural progress in quality.</p>
<p>One: Improve harvesting to seek pure quality of raw materials.</p>
<p>One: Improve manufacturing to seek the best technology.</p>
<p>(D) Development of international trade in tea types With the implementation of inspection, exports have a guarantee of purity. With the establishment of international credit, consumers are accustomed to the daily progress of supplies, and of course, they are happy to drink it; merchants are also brave in promoting it. With the increase in demand, there is an endless prospect for the future.</p>
<p>Last year, the inspection of tea in Wenzhou discovered adulteration. The Shanghai Inspection Bureau immediately informed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue a clear ban and sent personnel to promote the significance of the harm on the spot. The local inspection that had been suspended has now reorganized its strict array this year. Inspection promotes production, which has a clear proof.</p>
<p>Since the United States banned colored tea first, Africa has recently placed restrictions. The reason is that the colorants used are often impure in quality, and even contain lead chromate in yellow; and copper oxide in green. Why is it not welcomed abroad? It is only natural to immediately ban any coloring. Merchants are accustomed to using it for a long time; there is still considerable demand overseas; 丨丨 Although there are conditional restrictions, 丨丨 deeply worry that the change is too urgent, or it may not meet the supply situation. However, the fact that coloring will be eliminated by the existing required market is also an imminent fact. If we do not want Chinese tea to maintain and develop overseas trade in the endless future, we can just let everything go. The current inspection policy for coloring adopts a gradual ban. On the one hand, it is temporarily allowed to be exported; on the other hand, it stipulates the degree of coloring, reducing the standards year by year, so as to achieve natural color. As for impure colorants, they are absolutely prohibited; those that have no substitutes are also created separately. This is a more difficult problem, but it must be said that it is on the way to a solution. Last year, the standard for coloring was stipulated. Compared with the samples exported in the previous year, the number of samples on the standard and the same standard was very large. At that time, some tea producers believed that sales would inevitably be in danger of shortage. Since its implementation, the export volume has increased by 8%.</p>
<p>In short, inspection is beneficial to overseas trade. In particular, inspection is an active improvement policy; not a passive restrictionism, which is already a clear fact.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy of Japanese Tea Industry to Invade China</h3>
<p>— Lu Hui</p>
<p>In our country's foreign trade, everyone knows that silk and tea are the major exports. But if we ask ourselves, what is the current situation of China's silk and tea industry? Without even saying it, everyone looks worried, showing their deep pessimism. Considering why the silk and tea industry has declined to this point, the general observation is that it is due to the world's economic panic and reduced purchasing power. However, this is a temporary and accidental phenomenon and is not enough to represent the entire cause of the decline of China's silk and tea industry.</p>
<p>So, what is the main reason? In a word: "The Chinese people lack a competitive spirit." Not knowing competition, they neglect the unity of individual industries, and lack on-the-ground investigations and publicity to foreign countries, etc. The needs of consumer countries cannot be known, so there is no way to transfer or improve their industries. Internally, they do not value the improvement of raw materials, the renewal of equipment, and the refinement and cheapness of products as competitive tools. They hesitate and sit idly by, allowing the great industry's sales market to be stripped away.</p>
<p>The target of China's silk and tea competition is Japan. Japan is only a small island in East Asia. Because it is separated from China by only a narrow strip of water, communication has been mutual since ancient times. Culture and politics have always taken inspiration from China. The way of silk and tea has also been influenced by our country, shaping its customs. However, in the past, it did not have any achievements. Who knew that it would meticulously imitate and be determined to improve, day after day for a hundred years, and has already become a modern silk and tea country in the world!</p>
<p>The international raw silk market has already been entirely occupied by Japan, but this is not the subject of this article and will not be discussed further. Regarding the tea industry, Japan has accumulated hundreds of years of effort, developed vast tea gardens, and cultivated and manufactured with great innovation. As for the perfection of its organization, the thoroughness of its management, and the activity of its international publicity, the result has been to almost completely seize the American market for Chinese tea. In recent years, due to overproduction, it has turned its attention to competing for the Soviet Russian and African markets, which are important old customers of China. In the past three to five years, there have been astonishing achievements. The following is a list of Japanese silk and tea export figures for the past five years for reference: (Unit: pounds)</p>

<p>The above table shows that the import of Japanese tea to the United States and Canada has always maintained a huge number, indicating that the foundation of its monopoly has long been laid. The tea exported to France is also re-exported to Africa from France. Therefore, in recent years, Japanese green tea exports to Russia and Africa have been increasing year by year, with a momentum of rapid progress. The Russian and African markets, on which Chinese green tea relies, have already been significantly shaken at their core!</p>
<p>What surprises us most is that in the past three years, Japanese green tea has been imported into China, the birthplace of tea. Is this not a strange thing! It is found that in addition to supplying a small number of foreign residents in China, the majority of the quantity is transported to the Northeast. Since the puppet Manchukuo implemented a tariff of 30% on tea imports last year, Japanese tea has been transported in large quantities under the so-called preferential tariff. As a result, the domestic sales market of Chinese tea in the Northeast has also undergone a serious change!</p>
<p>Recently, Japan believes that the Northeast, a new sales channel, still prefers Chinese tea, and the quality does not meet the needs, causing difficulties in development. On the one hand, production has been increasing year by year, resulting in a sharp drop in tea prices. Therefore, the Shizuoka tea merchants, the center of the Japanese tea industry, gathered to discuss countermeasures. As a result, a fundamental improvement plan has been obtained. The so-called fundamental improvement plan is to recruit several Chinese tea-making technicians to guide the imitation of Chinese tea and implement low-priced dumping to compete with Chinese tea. This plan has now been implemented. It is said that Wu Yirui and Wu Shouchong, father and son, from Fuzhou, and Fang Nianzu from Shexian County, Anhui, have been invited to prepare to imitate Chinese-style green tea and promote it in the northeastern provinces. Their intentions are extremely deliberate, with the ambition to strip away our country's domestic and foreign sales markets. Should our national tea industry deeply reflect on this?</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of this city, in view of the seriousness of the endangered situation of Chinese tea, has recently convened tea merchants from all over Shanghai to discuss countermeasures to save the situation, and has discussed two steps: "The first step is to investigate the truth of the case; the second step is to conduct extensive international publicity to prevent consumers from suffering losses from counterfeit Chinese tea," etc. According to the above-mentioned methods, they are indeed necessary emergency measures, but they are not fundamental countermeasures!</p>
<p>At this time, it is a critical moment for the survival of Chinese tea. Local treatment will not work. Our national tea industry should know the seriousness of the situation, urgently awaken, arouse the spirit of competition, convene an organized organization, internally seek to improve cultivation and manufacturing methods; externally plan how to promote and sell, pool resources and efforts, and compete with Japan without compromise. With one heart and one mind, we must find a way out through struggle. The foundation of Chinese tea may have hope of being maintained!</p>
<h3>Talking about the Indian Tea Industry</h3>
<p>— He Jun</p>
<p>India is a British colony. Britain is the country with the largest import of black tea. Ninety-six years ago, the British tea market was completely dominated by our country. The British believed that the country's losses should not be ignored. Therefore, they worked hard to encourage the planting of tea trees in India, with the aim of seizing the position of Chinese tea and replacing it. Because of the strict organization and scientific research, in less than a hundred years, the deep color and strong taste of its tea quality, and the rapid increase in average production (more than 600 pounds per acre per year) are beyond the reach of Chinese tea. Now, the total export volume reaches more than 380 million pounds per year, accounting for about one-fifth of the total world export volume, more than five times the total export volume of Chinese tea in the same period. Even the wholesale or retail market price is several times higher than that of Chinese tea.</p>
<p>Although India has a large tea production, the Indians are not good at drinking tea. Six-sevenths of the production is sold overseas, directly transported to London or the United States and Australia for sale. Tea factories with short capital can sell nearby in the Calcutta tea auction market. Calcutta is the port of North India. Tea auctions are held every Tuesday. The tea market is the most prosperous from July to December. The seller's representative is the tea broker, Selling Broker. The nature of this tea broker is somewhat similar to that of tea warehouses in Shanghai, China. In addition to selling tea for customers, they sometimes also lend money to tea factories for economic assistance. However, the only remuneration for Indian tea brokers is a 1% commission, and there are no other improper tips. Because there are designated auction halls and designated land and water transportation warehouses, when auctioning and weighing, everyone is watching, and the people in charge absolutely cannot cheat. The payment procedures and dates after the sale are all stipulated. Even if the buyers and sellers are country bumpkins or complete laymen, it is difficult for them to suffer extra losses. Tea exporters must bear inspection fees, sample fees, and printing fees, which are about three annas per box. The warehouse rent is three annas and six pies for every 90 pounds, and nine pies for every week. The broker's remuneration is 1%. The government export tax is six annas per 100 pounds, and the export duty donation is one rupee and eight annas per 100 pounds, which is specifically used to expand overseas market publicity. Ocean freight to London costs two pounds and six shillings for every 50 cubic feet, and about 55 shillings to New York.</p>
<p>The most important reason why Indian tea can have its current development is that it has a complete and planned organization. The Indian Tea Association is the great union of tea planters in India, established in 1881. The headquarters are in London and Calcutta, and branches are located in all tea-producing areas in India. The association's mission, in addition to uniting the industry, has a scientific research department, The Spientficdepartment, and a tea experimental station, Tea Excemental Station, to study the most economical raw tea production methods and improve basic work such as cultivation and tea quality. The annual regular cost is about 200,000 rupees. Externally, there is a propaganda bureau, Propagaoda Cowpain, which specializes in promoting the development of Indian tea to the outside world. In recent years, large-scale tea has been taught in American cooking schools on how to drink Indian tea, and the newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting stations have been used to instill knowledge about Indian tea as much as possible. Twenty-five years ago, there was also an anti-Chinese tea trade publicity conference in London, Antj China Trde Compain, which specialized in excluding Chinese tea. There is also a tea tax committee, The Tea Cess Commttee, established in 1903, with a total of 20 members, representing tea factories, tea merchants, and related parties, to control and decide the use of tea taxes collected by the government, specifically for the promotion of the Indian tea market. Think about it, with such a huge amount of money every year, continuing to promote and develop externally, how can Indian tea not thrive? The United States has always been fond of green tea, but since the European war, under the influence of Indian tea's extensive publicity, it has gradually changed to prefer Indian Ceylon black tea. The amount of tea exported to the United States by China and Japan has decreased year by year. Although Japanese green tea has suffered losses from Indian tea in the United States, it has turned around and oppressed China, seizing our Russian and African tea markets. Alas! The fish eats the shrimp, and the shrimp eats the sand. The final loss is still our unorganized tea industry.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Soars Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Obviously a Kind of Abnormal Price Increase▲</p>
<p>Last week, June 4th to 9th, the entire week's experience in the Chinese Securities Exchange was the most valuable and highest-priced week since January 28th and the Fujian Rebellion last year. Since Gold Short broke the 68 yuan 8 jiao record in April on the third day of the previous week, new high prices were found every day last week. Consolidated Salt Tax and Regular Sixth also saw new high prices, with smooth sailing and soaring prices. At a time of commercial depression and rural bankruptcy, coupled with Sino-Japanese negotiations and many thorns, and the ominous signs between Japan and Russia, it is really unexpected that the public debt market price has had this kind of abnormal development. In fact, public debt transactions only have two types: investment and speculation. It is the time for the financial industry to close accounts for half a year, and there are no significant adverse situations in the current situation. Investment arbitrage has risen one after another, and the market price is naturally rising. Speculators have also used this point to fuel the flames, and the market price has been advancing. The shorts have different views and sell higher and higher. Then there is a part to cover the short position and a part to sell again. The market price is therefore getting higher and higher. At present, the majority of long arbitrage is definitely not going to fail. Whether the market price can return to a small one depends on whether the shorts have actual goods to deliver. Last week's trend, from Monday to the weekend, the market price rose every day, and Gold Short found a new high price every day. On Tuesday, it rushed out of the 70 yuan mark. Starting on Wednesday, Regular Sixth also rose sharply and found a new high price after January 28th. On Friday, Consolidated Salt Tax also found a new high price with a high rise. There was no sign of weakness throughout the week. It is rare to have such a good week. Therefore, in the current stable environment, it is not impossible for Consolidated Salt Tax to see 70% off. The result of the market price for the week was an increase of several jiao to 2 yuan 56 jiao. Ninety-Sixth also rose by about 8 jiao due to the restructuring theory. The total transaction volume was 85.6001 million yuan. The trend of the price increase is compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Ends Higher</h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (9th), the New York stock market continued the momentum of the previous day. With grains firm, it first rose more than one dollar. Then, due to the labor disputes in the steel industry, there was still no solution, and people's minds were inevitably confused. In addition, many bulls were taking profits, so the closing was still mixed. The demand for sugar was quite strong. American sugar factories created this year's new high. The government's wheat report was considered the worst report in history by the public, so grains soared. (Securities) After the sharp rise on the previous day, few bulls closed out on the weekend, indicating that there is a potential for continued gains next week. (Wheat) Except for Minnesota, there was a little rain. The reports of the American and Canadian governments showed that the disaster was extremely tragic. It is advisable to buy when prices are low. The status of secondary grains is lamentable. The only hope is that corn can be used as a substitute, so the hope of making money by buying corn is the greatest. (Cotton) The market is firm and strong, with local New York dealers buying in. Dealers are not very enthusiastic. The South is still selling slightly. A newspaper published a statement that the authorities denied the news of increasing 10 million acres in 1935. The weather in the East and Texas is not very good, but there are no irredeemable losses. (Rubber) The market is firm and strong, reflecting the stability of the main markets. The bulls closed out slightly. The total trading volume for the day was 700,000 shares.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm and stable due to slight purchases by dealers and Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 points and futures rose by 8 to 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 12 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to selling by speculators, but then rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee and 2.5 jiao, Aomula rose by 2.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (9th Telegram)</p>

<h3>Food Prices. Late Rice Shows Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources for various merchant groups are still scarce, with only about twenty-odd firms involved (handling about three thousand dan of goods). Furthermore, outgoing shipments are sluggish, leading to a sense of uncertainty among merchants. The reason for this is none other than the proximity of the holiday season and concerns about tight credit. Consequently, the market consistently presents a flat appearance, with no changes from the opening to the close. Although the Qingpu, Songjiang, and Liantang groups have collectively purchased Northern-style late rice, totaling one thousand four to five hundred packages, the price remains unchanged, and the situation is even showing signs of weakness. Regular rice varieties from the Changshu, Suzhou, and Nanhui areas continue to see limited purchases from merchants, but sales match supply, with no price fluctuations. Duyang glutinous rice is also holding steady. The supply of Yin Yuan rice is already scarce, so although transactions are few, the market seems relatively stable. Bian Yuan rice continues to face limited outbound shipments and remains weak.</p>

<h3>Royal Incense: Fleeting Records</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Judging by appearances alone, this band could indeed be considered very beautiful! Not only were the musicians' costumes so vibrant, but even the instruments, including the large frame, each had several brightly colored yellow ribbons tied to them, fluttering and dazzling.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this band's skills were good or bad, their job was certainly very difficult. Because as long as the Empress Dowager was happy, she would have them play immediately at any time and in any place. On the journey from Beijing to Fengtian, every time the train stopped, they had to climb down neatly, stand outside the window of the Empress Dowager's carriage, and play a tune as usual. I remember several times in the Empress Dowager's bedroom, and several times in the theater in the garden, the Empress Dowager herself closed her eyes, leaned comfortably on the dragon chair, and had this band play continuously beside her, often for several hours; her expression was truly like she was asleep..., but if this band stopped playing without her command, she would immediately wake up and question them for being lazy. These musicians were of course extremely afraid, because as long as she nodded her head lightly, their heads would be immediately chopped off!</p>
<p>(8) The Imperial Wardrobe</p>
<p>Among this series of imperial trains, there was also a carriage dedicated to carrying the clothes used by the Empress Dowager. Its grandeur and splendor were almost blinding and overwhelming; apart from the cloud-like brocade that you could see, you didn't need to bother trying to distinguish them in detail. Because there were simply too many of them, too beautiful, and their number was simply uncountable! But everything in this carriage was only about a quarter to a third of what was stored in the imperial wardrobe in the palace. (54)</p>
<h3>Bride Kidnapping</h3>
<p>— Ziyun</p>
<p>Across the street from the author, in a three-story attic in a shikumen building, lived a couple and a younger sister. The younger sister's name was Cai Di. All three of them worked in a tobacco company nearby. Cai Di was already twenty-one years old, and her fiancé had repeatedly wanted to marry her, but the wedding was delayed because they couldn't afford the betrothal gifts. Because Cai Di's fiancé was also a worker, and Cai Di's older brother insisted on receiving one hundred and twenty dollars in gifts, preferring to keep his sister unmarried until she was old. In reality, Cai Di's earnings were more than enough to cover her own food, clothing, and shelter.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at dusk, Cai Di went out to fetch water, and was dragged away by four burly men lying in ambush at the entrance of the alley. When people rushed out, she was already gone without a trace.</p>
<p>About three hours later, a man also dressed in a blue cloth jacket and trousers came to Cai Di's older brother's house and reported that Cai Di had been kidnapped by her fiancé to be married. He also sent sixteen dollars, as part of the Six Rites, so that both parties could interact in the future.</p>
<p>Cai Di's older brother immediately became furious, wanting to ask gangsters to settle the matter, but the person who brought the money persuaded him, and added four more dollars, totaling twenty dollars, which was considered a peaceful resolution. The next morning, Cai Di returned home with her husband, and both sides were very polite, as if there had never been a bride kidnapping the night before.</p>
<p>Although bride kidnapping seems too barbaric, I think it is quite economical.</p>
<h3>A Dog's Love</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>There are no police in the countryside, so to prevent petty thieves from visiting, almost every household keeps a dog. My neighbor, Old Man Wang, told me: "Dogs are more reliable than people, because they are always loyal to their duties, regardless of wind, rain, or snow; and no matter how poor and destitute you are, they will not ask for leave." After Old Man Wang's repeated encouragement, I finally raised a yellow female dog at the end of the year before last. When this dog first came to my house, it was still wet behind the ears. A year has passed, and it has grown to have thick legs and plump body, with glossy fur. In the eyes of the dog youths burning with the "fire of youth," she may be a very fashionable and modern dog girl! Therefore, my house is often surrounded by dozens of yellow, black, white, and spotted male dogs, barking and biting, playing the game of jealousy and fighting for love.</p>
<p>Our dog girl also couldn't resist the temptation of the males, and completely disregarding "parents' orders and matchmaker's words," she had a love affair with a male dog of the same color, and even began living together. I don't know where the male dog came from, I couldn't chase it away, and it shared the same bed, food, and play with our dog girl. When other male dogs saw it, they knew they had failed, and each tucked their tails and lowered their heads to flee. After a few days, the owner of the male dog came to find it, but it didn't pay attention when called, and wouldn't leave when pulled. Finally, its owner dragged it away by force. Who knew that in less than an hour, this yellow male dog ran back again and stayed with the dog girl again. The owner found it again, and seeing it escape again and again, he tied it with a rope and dragged it back. Along the way, the dog cried and pleaded as if weeping, while our dog girl drooped her head and lay on the ground, watching her beloved lover being taken away.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Watching Mournful Geese Protect the Homeland, Burying Heads, Bullets Pierce Strong Arms, Blood Stains the Lonely City</p>
<p>While the two of them were talking like this, Battalion Commander Shi Fang, ever vigilant, had already stood on a collapsed low wall, waving to all directions. His men had already searched for the common people everywhere and brought them all to this place. Bao Fang shouted: "Folks, listen up, the enemy planes have already come, and from now on, they will probably come every day. We soldiers take this lightly, it doesn't amount to much. But you can't stand the fright. When the planes come, you run and scream, which can disrupt military morale. Even though you are good people, at that time, I won't spare you. If you delay my military affairs, I will deal with you according to military law. Now, let me discuss it with you, folks. If you want peace, while it's still not too late today, pack your things and move away quickly. Take what you can, I certainly won't stop you. If you don't want to leave, I welcome you to help me and my company defend this land for the Republic of China. At that time, you will have to obey my command. I don't need you to fight, but I'll ask you to help dig bunkers and deliver food. But under military orders, I can't be polite with you. If you disobey my military orders, you will be punished with military sticks at the least, and shot at the worst. Think about which path you want to take now." After Bao Fang finished speaking, he thought that these common people would have nothing to say, and would certainly go home to pack their luggage and belongings. Unexpectedly, twenty or thirty people among the common people raised their rough, dark arms together and shouted: "We are willing to help the battalion commander fight the little devils." Bao Fang said, "Have you decided?" Those people all shouted, "We have decided." Bao Fang stood still and looked. Roughly speaking, there were about thirty to fifty people who had not raised their hands. (405)</p>
<h3>Two Public Exhibitions in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Changfeng</p>
<p>In Shanghai's celebrity circles, there are two people with the same name, Gongzhan. One is surnamed Pan, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Department and currently the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. He is efficient in his work, eloquent, writes well, and his calligraphy is graceful, derived from Su Shi's style. In recent years, he founded the Morning Post, New Evening Post, and Children's Morning Post, and participates in group work with enthusiasm. Therefore, from morning to night, he has no free time. The other is surnamed Xie, a painter and calligrapher. He is especially good at painting chrysanthemums, and his art is outstanding. Those who seek his works fill his doorway, and he paints tirelessly all day long. The names of the two gentlemen are often seen in newspapers, and they are also close friends, so many people mistakenly think that this Gongzhan is the other Gongzhan. Mr. Pan's wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, is also known for her paintings. I am familiar with both gentlemen, and friends often ask me to seek paintings from Mr. Pan on their behalf, so I specifically point this out, which is also a good story about celebrities.</p>
<h3>Beheaded Words</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>English has what are called beheaded words, which are a type of word game. In English, it's called "Beheaded Words." The method is to write a word linked by four or five letters, and remove its first letter to form another meaningful word. Then, remove its first letter again to form another meaningful word, such as: "Spea" (spear); removing its first letter forms "Pear" (pear); removing its first letter again forms "Ear" (ear). Chinese characters are not formed by linking letters, but there are also cases where removing the first part of a character forms another meaningful character. However, it is difficult to remove the beginning repeatedly. I will list a few examples below, which may also be considered beheaded words?</p>
<p>全 (quan), complete; removing its head forms 王 (wang), a surname, also the ruler of the world. 天 (tian), the pure air that rises; removing its head forms 大 (da), the opposite of small. 安 (an), peace and tranquility; removing its head forms 女 (nv), the opposite of male. 義 (yi), righteousness, what is appropriate; removing its head forms 我 (wo), oneself. 署 (shu), government office; removing its head forms 者 (zhe), a particle.</p>
<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>Idle Chat About Painting Eyebrows (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jin Erru</p>
<p>There are countless birds that sing well, but few that fight well. Those that combine both singing and fighting abilities are rare, and apart from the Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), there are almost none. The Hwamei originates from Sichuan, named for its eyebrow-like markings. Most are yellow in color, with occasional pure white ones. They are good at fighting and singing, and their voices are as skillful as a mockingbird, pleasing and nurturing. During the summer, their fighting is as fierce as that of the yellow-headed quail. I will briefly discuss the selection and raising methods of Hwamei for fellow enthusiasts to study.</p>
<p>(A) Selection Method</p>
<p>1.  Study of the Head: The head must be square and large, shaped like a shaved bamboo, good for fighting; long and slightly square, called "Wei Jiao," good for singing. Others like crab shells, Taoist hats, turtles, and round heads are common. As for olive heads, tangerine section heads, and water snake heads, they are of the lowest grade. Also, the neck hair and plain hair, their black patterns should be light, dense ones cause heavy ups and downs; those with a black line on the top also have heavy ups and downs; those with a red glow are impatient. High cranial bone is valued.</p>
<p>2.  Study of the Eyes: Eye color with chicken-yellow sand eyes, golden sand, white eyes, and large green, small green, emerald green, bean green, and other eyes are valued. Shapes like long waist, triangle, and buckwheat eyes are also good. There are also those with eyes as long as a horse's eye, which is a rare superior appearance. Dang eyes are inferior. Study of the Eye Ridge: Eye ridges like iron and dark color are superior, light green is next, and powder ridge is inferior. Ridge skin: color like lapis lazuli, mung bean is superior, moon white is next. Study of the Eyebrows: Long eyebrows like a line or short like bamboo shoots are excellent; wide eyebrows are next, curved eyebrows are inferior. Eyebrows like drooping beads and deer antlers are good at singing but not fighting. Eyebrow Patches: Eyebrows with black moles are called patches, double patches are valued, single patches are certainly untamed.</p>
<p>3.  Study of the Nose: To identify the gender of the bird, you must distinguish whether the nostrils are open or closed, open is male, closed is female.</p>
<p>4.  Study of the Beak: Beaks like bamboo roots with three ridges, or sharp and erect like nails, are valued; those like a bridge, a beam, or curved are inferior. Beak Color: The Hwamei's beak is a weapon for fighting, you must not only distinguish its shape, but also its color, colors like ox horn, yellow wax plum, are all superior generals.</p>
<p>5.  Study of the Lower Throat: A full lower throat is superior, empty is inferior.</p>
<p>6.  Study of the Neck: The neck should not be long, long like a crane's neck, it will have little strength when fighting; it should also not be short, short ones will certainly look up; if it is short and thick, it is called a tiger neck, certainly a fierce general.</p>
<p>7.  Study of the Chest: A wide chest is superior, narrow is inferior, narrow is a single chest, wide and flat is a double chest; those that are not good at singing are certainly chicken-chested.</p>
<p>8.  Study of the Back: A round back is rare, called a tiger shape, flat and wide is a common grade.</p>
<p>9.  Study of the Wings: Wings that are round and small, thin like coins are especially good, called cicada wings; those with crossed wings like sparrow wings are certainly inferior.</p>
<p>10. Study of the Elbow: Discussing the elbow, there are short, long, round, and flat; flat and short is superior; round and long, with extremely thick feathers, is not good.</p>
<p>11. Study of the Eyebrows: Discussing the quality of the Hwamei, it is first in the eyebrows, eyebrows that are wide are main, narrow eyebrows are neither good at singing nor fighting.</p>
<p>12. Study of the Palms: Palms with large tendons and bones, thick skin and flesh are main; those that are thin and small are common birds.</p>
<p>13. Study of the Legs: Legs like cow tendons, their color either yellow or white, with silky blood-like lines in the leg seams are superior; those like dry old rattan canes are also good; those like chestnut, vinegar residue, pine bark, ebony, purple bamboo, and other colors are certainly inferior.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Suicide</h3>
<p>— Ming Tang</p>
<p>Suicide is the most dishonorable thing. A person who commits suicide is utterly bored and beyond redemption. People should struggle; people are fundamentally fighting animals. Especially in this society, in an era of intense and fierce struggles between people (large-scale struggles of entire groups of people), people cannot survive without struggle, and there is no way to talk about being human. However, suicide also has a redeemable value, which is the courage in the moment of suicide. That is, the courage to disregard everything. The entire act of suicide is completely meaningless, but the courage to disregard everything in the moment of suicide can be applied to other areas.</p>
<p>Struggle is difficult, but if you think this way: I might as well commit suicide, putting my life aside, then your courage to struggle will come. This is a good example of applying the courage to disregard everything in the moment of suicide to other things. By extension, when you encounter all difficulties, if you do it with the spirit of suicide, I think there is nothing you cannot do well. Chinese people are too mediocre, too complacent. This mediocrity, this complacency, has harmed our lives. I think if everyone could be not mediocre, not complacent, we could still do some things. The reason we are so mediocre, so complacent, is because we lack the spirit of suicide too much. Suicide exists, but it is limited to taking sleeping pills, or, more advanced, jumping into the Huangpu River. Like the Japanese who die by seppuku, falling off cliffs, or being run over by trains, is rarely seen in our country. This is clear evidence that Chinese people are too mediocre and complacent, even death must be very safe, very mediocre and complacent. If we want a strong country, we must promote the spirit of not being mediocre and not being complacent. That is, we must promote the active spirit of suicide - the spirit of resistance. If everyone could put forward the active spirit of suicide, the spirit of resistance, I think the current situation in China would at least be better than it is now.</p>
<p>The spirit of suicide is to forget your own life, to think of yourself as already dead, or to think of yourself as just about to die. Applying this spirit to do social undertakings, or your own undertakings, I think the result will be successful. Even if it is not completely successful, a considerable achievement is certain.</p>
<p>We are against suicide, but we actively promote the spirit of suicide. Not afraid of suicide, only afraid of not being willing to commit suicide. We must instill the active spirit of suicide in the masses, calling on everyone to rise up, to be able to commit suicide - to be able to actively resist.</p>
<h3>Remembering Willow Catkins</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>It is late spring, oh, late spring and early summer weather are not very different in general feeling, however, there are some differences in the countryside. No, it can't be said that way, it is not only in the countryside, it also has the same expression in the city. Isn't it? Women in the city are walking like corpses in extremely thin clothes, and the laborers who are squeezed with sweat are struggling naked with their limbs and lives!</p>
<p>A gentle breeze brings countless soft flying rain, like cotton, sprinkling, sprinkling, how gentle! Like white velvet, one point, two points, ... gradually, connecting, condensing. When a slight wind, or a wind propagated by the movement of people's clothing, is sent to its body, how pitiful it should be! They are flying, rolling, and collapsing along with it.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, seeing the flying willow catkins, I can't help but think of women. Really, I remember in the past, no, even now, it is still like this, when a woman does not adhere to the moral standards of women, the so-called "moral standards of women", needless to say, is loyalty specifically to one person, which is necessary, a certain guilt must be added, so the words "changing allegiance" and "fickle as willow catkins" will very skillfully be added to a certain person's head, as if these words are very sufficient to express their character.</p>
<p>Here, I will not ask whether this act is correct, nor whether it is adapted to general different facts, in this current society that is male-centered, in the present that all the potential cannot be eliminated, parasitic women, the fact that they are despised, ridiculed, and even scolded, is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Why use this "willow catkins" to compare women? Oh!</p>
<p>Willow catkins are soft, floating, any kind of slight force can blow them, this, perhaps is to say her gentleness, floating, is the same as willow catkins? I think.</p>
<p>Months and years are progressing year by year, and willow catkins are also flying and floating as usual. When this recessionary wave swept the modern world, no matter how the so-called unfaithful women are regarded as unchaste and scum by the iron-faced moralists, but, in this recessionary wave, what method can they use to avoid the vortex of this capitalist society?</p>
<p>A gentle breeze brought countless soft flying rains, like cotton, sprinkling, sprinkling.</p>

<h3>Sea of Love Leak</h3>
<p>— Bai Rong</p>
<p>Standing on the seashore, watching the boundless dreamlike waves, listening to the murmurs of the stars in the clear sky, and the gentle rustling of the breeze among the spring trees, a sea-like love surges within the young heart. It is a love containing silvery sincerity, crimson expectations, pale purple melancholy, and emerald green tenderness, a love that no one knows, a lonely and desolate love buried in the seabed.</p>
<p>Oh, dreamlike past! Oh, traceless life!</p>
<p>At the end of the sea, gentle places are scattered with scaly clouds, hiding the person who receives my private blessings. She carries with her a whole string of bright days from our past, living quietly there. But she is lonely, like a secluded orchid. She uses her bewildered eyes to gaze at the sea, at the rose-colored sunrise and sunset on the sea, the seagulls and the sailing ships, looking for news from this side of the sea.</p>
<p>The days of the past are like fallen flowers pressed between the pages of an old book. When organizing them, perhaps a warm fragrance flows out, but when you think of the vanished image of life, you can't help but feel a layer of faint sorrow like a midnight lamp returning to a dream.</p>
<p>On a certain drizzling morning, two small lives parted, like two golden leaves falling from a branch and scattered by the wind. Filled with parting emotions, I rushed alone into the ocean of this world. I forgot the harbor, and I forgot the reefs. Years passed around me like clouds. Since then, when the sea breeze howled in my ears, when the crickets' complaints struck the autumn window of my lodging, when the night was late and the moon was as clear as water, the past would visit me with a melancholy face. It gave me a rare purple dream every night, and a few desolate tears.</p>
<p>Now I am on the seashore, with thousands of miles of waves in front of me, dotted with the fishing lights of stars, and behind me is a metropolis like a promiscuous woman, encompassing millions of people. It spews out flames of light and heat, revealing a venomous scarlet tongue of resentment towards the sky. I do not smile, letting one or two strands of silence linger on my face, thinking darkly about the grievances and joys of life.</p>
<p>But the boundless sea breathes evenly in front of me, playing harmonies in the shadows. Like cymbals, like falling leaves, like the roar of a beast, it does not rise and fall under the lilac-colored purple sky. The roar and whisper of the sea, the confusion of dreams, the purity of the heart, and the solemnity of the twilight that appears around it, weave together into a most enchanting and magical painting. No, this is not just a picture, it is the purest and most gentle sound of nature in the universe, composing a silent and distant poem.</p>
<p>I cannot forget the days of the past. Ah, sea! Sea that floats with slight joy and stirs with small waves! Don't forget to carry my love like a light sail to the other side!</p>
<p>I will find the vanished love on that side.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>Pawnshops are as numerous in Shanghai as pavilions in the Grand View Garden, everywhere to be found, even like on Wusong Road, where the whole street is full of pawnshops. And people living in Shanghai are used to the matter of going to pawnshops, not feeling strange at all, and of course, there is no sense of shame. However, in my hometown! Shantou, Guangdong! The situation is completely different. Ordinary families, even when they are in difficulty, would rather use other methods to remedy it than go to a pawnshop. Because the matter of going to a pawnshop is, in the eyes of ordinary people, simply a great shame. And the business of pawnshops can only be counted on from those bankrupt families. Therefore, I lived in my hometown for seventeen years, and not only had I never been to a pawnshop, but I also knew nothing about the situation inside the pawnshop, such as the procedures at the time! It wasn't until I left my hometown and drifted to Shanghai that I gradually understood the ways of this pawnshop under the whip of life.</p>
<p>However, when I first sent things to the pawnshop, I felt so timid and ashamed. I saw that big, black character for "pawn" as if a big, black face was sneering at me, as if saying, "Hey! Now you should understand the ways of the pawnshop, you bankrupt family!" It really made people afraid to go in. However, when forced by life and unable to think of any other way, I had no choice but to bite the bullet and rush into the door of this pawnshop.</p>
<p>In this short year, I put all my more valuable watches, fur robes, coats, and suits into the pawnshop, making me a familiar figure here. I no longer feel timid or ashamed about going to the pawnshop, and like the people of Shanghai, I am used to it and don't feel strange at all.</p>
<p>But this morning, in a situation of being out of food, when I took a pair of the last remaining Western-style pants to the pawnshop: after walking through North Sichuan Road and Wusong Road, and entering all the pawnshops on these two roads, not only did I not get the price of two dimes, but I tasted a kind of embarrassing taste from the people in those pawnshops that I had never tasted in my life; thus, the shame of being a bankrupt and the sorrow of being at the end of the road surged into my heart again. I wanted to cry but had no tears. I finally understood the reason why pawnshops in Shanghai were so ubiquitous and numerous. I deeply felt that these pawnshops that oppress the poor will inevitably be crushed under the wheels of the times with the changes in the social and economic organization.</p>

<h3>Bolt from the Blue</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>In today's deformed society, one can see unequal facts everywhere. Whether it is a bank, a large company, a factory, or even a small shop, the bank president, the company manager, and the small shop owner have to adopt a policy because they want to oppress the small clerks and shop assistants. For senior staff or those with nepotistic relationships, the treatment is always particularly generous and lenient. On the contrary, small clerks and shop assistants are subjected to all kinds of oppression, the so-called "making money is not hard work, hard work does not make money." Even if you are usually diligent and very hardworking, if you don't have a good backing, you will always be a small clerk or shop assistant for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Jin has been working in a certain company in this port for more than ten years. He is honest and hardworking. The company's business is also very developed. When he joined the company, his monthly salary was ten yuan. Although it has gradually increased to twenty yuan, many of those who came after him have already been promoted to directors and section chiefs, with monthly salaries of fifty or sixty yuan. In the eyes of others, although they feel injustice in their hearts, my friend always blames himself for not having good relatives and blames himself for perhaps having shortcomings in his daily work, so he still works diligently and contentedly. Unexpectedly, like a bolt from the blue, the company, on the grounds that it has been affected by the recession in recent years, in order to save expenses, implemented layoffs, and my friend was among those laid off because of his small backing. I think he has a white-haired old mother in her sixties, as well as a wife and young children, a family of several people. Not being unemployed can still barely make a living in the countryside. After being unemployed, they will feel great panic, and besides, where can they find work in today's overstaffed world? Therefore, my friend is anxious day and night, and the thought of suicide arises spontaneously, otherwise, it is inevitable to sit and wait for death and stray into the wrong path, and there is really no way. I feel very emotional when I see his situation: why do honest and hardworking people have this kind of encounter? Those who spend their days drinking and having fun can sit safely and get high salaries. Kind sir, please do not spare your golden words and answer in the newspaper. Sincerely wishing you well, Xia Sixin respectfully</p>
<p>Answer: The kind of "oppressing small clerks" and relying on power to do things that you mentioned is precisely a symbol of China's backwardness. Needless to say in socialist countries, even in advanced capitalist countries, whether in industry or commerce, the rewards and punishments for staff are all based on "efficiency" and "performance" as standards, and no personal feelings or power are discussed. The reason is that after the development of capitalism, industry and commerce must be rationalized and scientific management methods must be emphasized, and this kind of corruption cannot exist naturally. China is different. All industries are very backward, work skills do not need to be emphasized, and the number of unemployed people is large. If you are not strict with the boss's treatment, you can leave, and others will come to do it. On the other hand,</p>
<p>Li Zenglian, styled Boting, from Hangxian, Zhejiang, recently came to Shanghai and devoted himself to painting. Ding Jie, styled Yunbi, from Jinshan, Jiangsu, is a famous painter and the wife of Li Boting.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>the traditional habit of pulling in relatives and friends is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Therefore, the situation you mentioned is very common. However, looking at feelings and talking about power have considerable limits. I had a classmate before who wanted to take the exam for a famous university and felt that he would not be admitted. It happened that one of the people in charge of managing the scores of candidates in that school was his close relative, so he begged this relative and asked him to find a way. Who knew that his relative actually said to him: "I can't guarantee that you will be admitted. If you do very badly on the exam, I can't think of any way; but if there are many people with the lowest admission score, and they can't all be admitted, if you are one of them, then I can take you first." Your paragraph is very instructive to us. Although your friend is very honest and loyal to his duties, other colleagues of the same level as him may not be worse than him, even if they are bad, they can't be much worse, so the company can use whether there is a relationship or power as a standard for layoffs. If his colleagues of the same level, although they have great power, do things very badly, the boss would not fire your friend and keep that colleague. As for treating senior staff preferentially, or in other words, unequal treatment, this is the normal state in this unequal society, and it is not surprising at all. Moreover, service is divided into responsible or planned and affairs or technical types. Labor is also a kind of commodity, and its remuneration or value naturally has high and low differences.</p>
<p>The inequality between upper and lower-level staff and the disparity in treatment, etc., can only be eliminated in an equal society. As for our demand for job security, in addition to social reasons such as market depression, if you work diligently and have higher work skills, the chance of being laid off will naturally be less.</p>
<p>In school enrollment exams, if the number of admissions is small, of course, the hope of admission is small. If your grades are very good, the hope of admission is also very high. Similarly, if the company wants to lay off many people (this is a social reason and must be overcome with social forces), the chance of being laid off is great. If your work performance is very good, the possibility of being laid off is naturally smaller. Editor</p>

<h3>Impressions of Chang'an (3)</h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>(4) "Sweet Water" and Xi'an's "Nanjing Road"</p>
<p>The city of Chang'an, with a population of hundreds of thousands, does not have a better facility to provide residents with clean drinking water. Whether it is government agencies, schools, hostels, or residences, people's drinking water is mostly taken from private wells. The taste is astringent and the quality is turbid, "after a long time, you don't smell its stink"! It is said that the water from the Big Well in the West Gate is "sweet water," which is different from other well water. However, it is inconvenient to fetch and transport, and the price is high, so of course, most citizens cannot share it.</p>
<p>I saw a water shop with a sign hanging in front of the door: "Selling Sweet Water from the Big Well in the West Gate." But the entrance was deserted, and there were no customers. I don't know if I've eaten, or if I've ever had the sweet water from the Big Well in the West Gate! I only know that the boiled water poured out of the thermos bottle, after being in the cup for one or two minutes, will have some sediment, and when you drink it, you feel a disgusting earthy smell. The South Courtyard Gate where the Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters is located is Xi'an's "Nanjing Road." The prosperity of commerce here is naturally incomparable to Shanghai's Nanjing Road. But as far as the commercial center of Xi'an is concerned, the South Courtyard Gate is indeed much more lively than any other street!</p>
<p>If it is said that the shops in Shanghai, in order to cope with the depressed market, universally hold price reduction competitions, then the merchants on Xi'an's "Nanjing Road" are even more hoarding and "fleecing" because of the depression!</p>
<p>They take advantage of the inconvenience of transporting goods and the lack of certain commodities in the market. If you don't buy it, that's it. If you want to buy it, you have to pay a high price. They know: customers will never be angry because a flashlight that sells for one yuan in Shanghai sells for five yuan in Xi'an, and specially take a car to Shanghai to buy it directly!</p>
<p>Because of the merchants' "hoarding," customers dare not inquire, which leads to the shops in the South Courtyard Gate being deserted. However, as long as a customer runs in, then no matter how much you buy, as long as it is something transported from Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., they will always give you a big fleecing!</p>
<p>(5) In front of the East Horse Road Post Office</p>
<p>The fortune-telling stalls in Shanghai, the better ones are concentrated in the City God Temple, and the others are mostly scattered in the workers' areas. The fortune-telling stalls in Xi'an are all arranged in front of the post office on East Horse Road. It is said that this is in line with economic principles! The post office is an agency for mailing letters; the fortune-telling gentlemen take advantage of the sideline of writing letters and set up their stalls in front of the post office. This is truly rationalizing production!</p>
<p>The XX Garden (forgotten!) opposite the post office is Xi'an's high-class human flesh market. Going in through the main gate, there are countless old-style bungalows inside (with a few damaged buildings), surrounded on three sides, forming a large poppy-shaped square, and the main gate of XX is like a tightened bottleneck.</p>
<p>The charming girls from Shandong, Henan, Tianjin, Huaiyang, and local products sell their charms by the door in groups of three or five as the setting sun sets. At night, bright gas lamps are hung in front of the doors of several larger brothels on the edge of the square, attracting tourists, and the sounds of strings and songs can be heard endlessly.</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Haunted House: The New Residence of Pert Kelton (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>Moaning sounds from downstairs are incessant.</p>
<p>Branches outside the house join together to make long cries.</p>
<p>When we Chinese move, we must inquire about the good or bad luck of the house. People dare not live in houses where people have died or where something has happened. Many people say that this is because the Chinese are too superstitious, but in foreign places, such things are also often heard. Even in movies, there are not a few. Of course, most of this comes from comedy, but what we see in movies, whether it comes from comedy or not, always has a social thought as its basis, so that it can be understood by a group of people. Foreigners are also very afraid of haunted houses. Sometimes ghosts appear in the house in the middle of the night, showing all kinds of terrifying shapes. No matter how unbelieving you are, you can't deal with it, and you can only move to a better place. Now let's talk about the haunted house in Hollywood. Of course, I can't determine whether there are ghosts in the universe, but since this happened in Hollywood, and there are movie magazines that record it in detail, I will just translate it casually, and readers can listen to it casually.</p>
<p>The Hollywood female star Pert Kelton recently bought an Italian-style villa in the suburbs of Hollywood, with eight large rooms inside. It is a very exquisite house, but it may be a bit too old, because the antiques displayed in the reception room are all genuine Italian imports. The trees outside the house are lush and green, surrounding the house, with luxuriant branches and leaves swaying in the wind, but it may be a bit too quiet. Pert Kelton fell in love with the house at first sight and bought it immediately. After she bought the house, the only people living with her were her mother and one of her cousins. Apart from a few family members, there were no neighbors around, which was truly lonely. Pert Kelton is a bold woman. Since they moved in, they have heard sighs and moans every night, rising from the basement in bursts. In addition, there are also sounds of heavy objects hammering and fingers scratching the walls, constantly coming out. Furthermore, in the reception room, the light switches often make clicking sounds, but no light comes from the light bulbs. Even the light switches are completely controlled by ghosts. Pert herself cannot turn on the lights. The clicking sounds actually form a rhythm with the moans in the basement.</p>
<p>At four o'clock one morning, when the sky was not yet bright, the pitiful moaning sound in the basement became loud. Pert immediately called the wireless police. They ran into the basement and inspected it for a week, but found nothing. They said that there were neither ghosts nor thieves there. But as soon as they left, the moaning sound started again. "Could it be that it's caused by my mental disorder?" Pert said, "But I find it hard to believe. Because it's not just me who heard it. Are my mother and my cousin as mentally disordered as I am? Later, terror penetrated my heart, and I couldn't sleep at night. I often stayed awake all night, listening quietly to the continuous appearance of various strange sounds. Sometimes a long, deep moan came up from downstairs, making people's hair stand on end. Fortunately, our two bedrooms are upstairs." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Eskimo"</h3>
<p>— Hu Yue</p>
<p>"Eskimo" is a work that depicts how imperialism invades and oppresses the Eskimo people, but this cannot be found in "Eskimo." What is here is a small poem of love, a curse of the god of love on national prejudice, and a hymn to a great hunter. In short, it is a love film with a unique flavor.</p>
<p>The scientific expedition team sent by the imperialist country is actually the vanguard of the invaders (naturally, we do not deny its considerable value in science). This has been repeatedly proven in our country, but here, its true face is covered up.</p>
<p>The success of "Eskimo" is greatly helped by the screenwriters Howard J. Green and Ainsworth Morgan. That is to say, by contrasting the simple and backward world of the Eskimos with the civilized world of modern capitalism, by touching the audience with the pure love of a naive and great hunter, by creating a tragedy of love with national prejudice, and finally, by concluding with the rebirth of the great hunter, this love story surpasses all the cliches, the greasy and annoying old abuses, and changes the taste of the audience.</p>
<p>"Eskimo" depicts an Eskimo who has just come into contact with modern novelties and does not understand them, but is a lovely innocence, which is very interesting. In particular, Yago's beautiful replication of the metropolitan scenery outside the car in the car subtly depicts the difference between the two worlds.</p>
<p>Equally wonderful is the ending, when Yago has returned to his hometown, recalling the loveliness and terrible heartbreak of the English woman Joan in the wind and snow, and the leisurely scene of sitting upright and silently remembering and being moved by the child to restore his hunter's face.</p>
<p>Here, Yago's sincere love is written so touchingly. From the straightforward and euphemistic sentences composed of his simple vocabulary and wrong grammar, from his cherishing, joy, and ignorant self-deprecation, the audience can love him because he is so rough and naive.</p>
<p>However, whiskey destroyed his beautiful dream, and in reality, every audience will know that it is national prejudice that killed his love. When the audience sees that he has no choice but to listen to people's persuasion and return to his hometown, and sees him painfully recalling in the wind and snow and falling in the wilderness, everyone will sympathize with him, perhaps not just finding this barbaric hunter ridiculous and pitiful, but arousing disgust for national prejudice.</p>
<p>"Eskimo" should therefore receive a higher evaluation than those vulgar and ordinary romances. This is based on Ainsworth Morgan's original novel, and we must also mention this writer here.</p>
<p>As for the joy of a kind of rebirth at the end, this script leaves a lot of aftertaste.</p>
<p>The acting of Fresselette, who plays Yago, is indeed very successful. Not only is he experienced in facial expressions, but he has won the victory by grasping the activities of the personality as a whole. Audiences who are tired of mediocre love stories and talk about interest may wish to change their tastes.</p>

<h3>Review of "Lights of Paris"</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>"Lights of Paris" directed by Feodor Ozep, the director of "Moscow Intrigue", is another work that depicts a romance, a story full of French sentiment.</p>
<p>The love story of a red singer and a female student is interspersed with kidnapping and robbery. However, what we can see here is not a corner of French society, but a pink dream!</p>
<p>The twists and turns in the screenwriting are obvious advantages, but these twists and turns are felt to be excessively contrived, especially the section where the robber gives the hostage a precious brooch, which is too futile.</p>
<p>The director's technique still has its characteristics. The rhythmic cadence and the handling of static features, the Paris Tower at the beginning, the scenery outside the window, as well as the traffic of cars and the night scenery in the back, the interweaving of the lively atmosphere in the theater and the talk of love in the apartment, these places are very good.</p>
<p>However, the self-covering of the kettle lid and the description of the audience's emotions in the theater at the end are too exaggerated and too commonplace, with a very strong romantic atmosphere.</p>
<p>What must be praised is the clear depiction of Marie's personality, as well as the successful acting of Jacqueline Francell, such as Marie's hesitation when greeting Fang Shu for the first time, and the way Fang Shu's wife deals with her to deal with the men who entangle her.</p>
<p>However, what is the significance of this "Lights of Paris"?</p>
<p>The female student's love and art have both been successful, and the whole play ends in the atmosphere of passionate love and art. This is to decorate the ugly reality and make the audience forget the turmoil of the world.</p>
<p>Can this work that decorates reality still have progressive significance now?</p>
<h3>Not Knowing the Cruelty of a Joke</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>One day, Li Silian, Howard, and William Gagen were filming an exterior scene for "Of Human Bondage" at the Leidianhua ranch. Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Gagen, having nothing to do in their leisure, went to the ranch to watch them film. After the filming was finished, Howard and Gagen discussed going to a nearby village to buy something to eat. Their wives had already left, but on the way, Howard and Gagen's car caught up with their wives' car. They deliberately didn't greet them and drove past, not even looking at them. Unexpectedly, after driving half a mile, they heard their wives calling for a traffic policeman. Soon, the traffic policeman on a motorcycle caught up with their car, stopped them, and said they were speeding, violating traffic regulations, and that two women had accused them of squeezing their car to the side of the road, almost causing them to fall into a ditch. They also said they were probably two drunks. In this situation, they truly had no words to explain themselves and could not escape. They had no choice but to accept the summons and prepare to pay the fine. Now, when they think of their wives' prank, they still feel somewhat resentful, constantly thinking of ways to get revenge.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Till the Seas Run Dry and the Rocks Crumble (Registered Nurse) (6)</h3>
<p>— Xie Hua</p>
<p>Her only way to dispel sorrow and resentment was through work. This was also the reason why she didn't mind hard work. However, the tears that she refused to shed for her own misfortune burst forth in the nurses' lounge! Because a small child in the hospital, one she deeply cared for, had died. Shulesi found her, quickly hugged her, and comforted her; "Darling, why are you always crying?" Peng choked and couldn't speak. Finally, she said through tears; "Why did he have to die? His life hadn't even begun yet; there was so much he could have seen and done in this world!" These words lingered in her heart even after her tears had stopped. Life is like morning dew, and life and death are especially unpredictable. What exactly is life all about? What worries does it entail? Perhaps Gregg Knowles is right.</p>
<p>Gregg Knowles, on the other hand, often instilled his view of life into her parched heart. Life should not be taken too seriously; one should enjoy oneself when there is enjoyment. There is no need to shed tears for the past or worry about the future; only the joy of the present moment is real and should be seized and not abandoned. Therefore, since Peng told him everything that had happened, he had tried in every way to explain it to her. Although her husband was not dead, he had become insane and was confined to an asylum. He was lucid less and less each day, but "You haven't let him down. You don't owe him anything. Hasn't he completely given up all the rights of a husband? Why should you be deceived and oppressed by this situation and give up all the joys of life? Isn't that his own fault? Didn't he almost take your life?" Knowles explained to her layer by layer, gradually influencing her until she couldn't help but be persuaded.</p>
<p>Soon, Shulesi also had a lover. He was a young policeman. After Shule and he got engaged, Gregg Knowles held a celebratory feast for her. Of course, the purpose of this banquet was not to celebrate Shulesi's engagement, but to further advance on Peng. While the guests were happily chatting and laughing, Peng slipped out to the balcony alone. Knowles followed her like a shadow. He saw her wearing a simple evening dress, which only highlighted her natural beauty, unlike ordinary beauty, and the narrow waist was adorned with the flowers he had given her. She saw him following her out and couldn't help but feel a stirring in her heart, and he, too, was once again attracted by her beauty, and the desire to possess her was even stronger as the beauty was so close. So he walked up, put his arm around her waist, and leaned in to kiss her cherry lips. Peng also couldn't help but feel a surge of spring, as if she were coming back to life. At this moment, Knowles whispered in her ear; "Don't waste your years, and don't let me down, don't let down the fact that we love each other deeply..." Peng heard this and suddenly took a step back. "But I can't betray my loyalty to him," she said. Knowles said with righteous indignation; "Loyalty! Loyalty to what? Loyalty to an unbearable marriage contract? Loyalty to a love that has been destroyed?" Peng shook her head helplessly and said; "I still have my responsibilities, I can't just get rid of them. I beg you... try to understand my difficulties." She was clearly begging him. (To be continued)</p>
