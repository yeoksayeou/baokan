<h3 id="c52">米價重漲之取締·敬 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>上海市糧價委員會。鑒於米價重復上漲。民食堪虞。設不加以制限。一旦激成食糧恐慌。殊與平民生計及社會安寗有碍。故議定米價最高額不得超過十三元五角。並呈請社會局準此取締米商。削平米價。障民食。今年荒旱奇重。而災區又極廣大。長江産米各省。幾莫不感受影響。雖現在尙未至收穫其間。不能預斷損失之精確數字。然而秧苗旣已枯萎。田地又復龜裂。大勢觀察。匪特灌溉困難之區。將無所收穫。卽溝渠縱横各處。其收成恐亦將在减半以下。斯誠蒼生之浩刦也。</p>
<p>考我國農業經營之積。習號稱「米蠹」者。專在新穀上市時。盡量收買。而於次年靑黄不接時售出。一轉手間。坐享厚利。如今年秋收無望。米價自較常年爲高。而屯積之戶。乃欲得更高之價。靳而不售。加以邇來天旱水淺。河道交通。痛感不便。米船運輸。遂更見减少。城市糧商。際此時會。又安得而不從中操繼市價。圖謀巨利耶。以常理而論。我國過去數年。多屬豐收。今年偶一閙旱。卽令收成减少。亦不難以存穀救濟。渡此難關。無奈我國近若干年來。農村經濟始終在慢性恐慌之侵蝕中。中産以下之農家。絶鮮隔年之糧。貧民更不待論。是以在豐收時代。僅能勉强支持。殊無餘羨。積蓄已少。突遇巨災。自無從有彌補挹注之可能。常平積穀之設。原爲預防農荒之要政。惟辦理不力。等於虚設。已完全失其應盡之功用矣。</p>
<p>一般城市工商業漸趨發達。而内地産糧區域與城市間之交通。仍沿用舊時工具。費時多而運費昻。於是廣州上海天津各沿海城市。多仰賴海外食糧之輸入。而國内農産反退居於次。在昔豐收時期。外糧湧入。數亦不貲。穀賤之恐慌。於焉激化。至於今日。農産歉收。一般農民又不得不以高價購買糧米。以維持其最低生活。年歲豐嗇。雖有輪流轉換。而農民窮苦。則益變本加厲。至於城市承農村衰落之敝。小民生計。本已竭厥不堪。如米價之漲風不加限制。亦惟有與農民同歸於盡而已。</p>
<p>限制米價。已爲今日關心民瘼者一致之呼聲。其手段固在取締米商之操縱。及屯戶之居奇。此舉如能收效。至少能有消極的效果。爲小市民謀一時之保障也。吾人非不知穩定民食。當有整個之計劃。然後可以據此計劃。由局部而推廣。卽如統制全國糧食。提倡者已頗不乏人矣。然而茲事體大。非有全國通籌。中樞恊謀。必不爲功。我國國民經濟。素乏組織。關於全國糧食之産銷。稅則運輸。種植。等項。尙鮮確切調查。他何待論。無已。惟有退求其次。嚴定最高米價之限制。以濟眉急。同時由各省市負責當局。向銀行籌借欵項。搜購存米。以備秋後之需要耳。如此則雖在消極的意義之下。以求市價之平衡。猶勝於空洞寛泛之救濟策。在茲米價重漲聲中。甚望本市當局。能實事求是。限制米價。預購屯糧。以爲小民造福也。</p>

<p>陶爾菲斯被剌的影響</p>
<p>德國企圖合併難實現</p>
<p>奥大利是歐洲政治上經濟上的巨大癌腫、照目前的情况、絶無醫治的方法、因爲戰前的粤國爲奥匈聯邦、雖然是兄事德意志、但他自已還擁有五千一百幾十萬人口、有面積六十七萬七千方公里的士地、不失其爲中歐洲的大國、工業縱比較的落後、在列强中依舊可以維持其獨立性、及至聖傑門條約成立以後、他人口祗有六百幾十萬、土地面積縮小到八萬二千四百平方公里、而維也納一市就占了全人口听百分之三十、生産上决無可以自全之道、特别是世界經濟恐慌襲到歐洲以來、奥國國民經濟更日在風雨飄颻之中、完全靠借債過日子、國聯於一九二一年保證借給的六萬五千萬金克洛尼、到一九二九年信用銀行倒台的時候、又陷於經濟的悲境、並且今後不容易找到解决的方法、甚至於没有解决的方法、而政治上對德合併、因本國人民的反威、與凡爾賽體系諸國及意大利的反對、實現是不可能的、如果完全聽從意大利的請求、向獨立的路綫上猛進、也會遇着國社黨潛勢力的暗礁、萬難成功、</p>
<p>陶爾菲斯所依附的政黨是基督敎社會黨、是奥國最右翼的黨派、雖陶氏曾以内閣總理資格身兼外交·公安·農林·國防·等四總長、很有俯視一切的獨裁形態、但其餘七位閣員中、竟有四位是衛國團團員、與陶氏的意見不盡一致、這裏有兩件事實爲證、第一是是副總理斯太倫堡公爵（衛國團領袖）當本年六月墨索里尼與希特勒會面之後、奥國高倡反對恐怖主義的時候、他以爲「單把恐怖手段委給國家的執行官吏是不行的、」陶爾菲斯在維也納郊外的演說、又以爲「······當國家多事之秋、一切團體都該聯合起來、把那些恐怖行爲者拉到自己陣營裏來、當此事機迫切的時候、絶不許有中間地位、凡不是我們的同志、就都是我們的商人、」他們二人的對立已很顯然可見了、第二是直到最後一刻、丨丨七月二十五日丨丨陶氏被國社黨人圍困在一間屋子裏、一約於把他殺了、而同時被拘的、像部總長·國家保安統監·費少佐·則免於難、由此可見陶氏自己並没有把握着實力、又證明了衛國團與他步調並不一致、</p>
<p>衛團的來源是歐洲大戰之後、奥國吃了敗仗、意大利的猶哥的軍隊都開入奥國境内、這些軍隊大都缺乏統制力、又是戰勝國的行爲、所以侵占掠奪的行爲到處發生、奥國人民亟思反抗、並用實際的力量來阻止這一煩的暴行、於是農村靑年和在野軍人在各地方自動的組織起來、後來由地方而發展到全國、所以又有個别名呌「前衛團」、這次暴動、丨丨陶氏被害後丨丨奥國幾陷於混亂不可收拾的狀態、纔由斯太倫堡「衛國團、」的領袖率領該團出而鎭壓國社靑年團、力圖恢復一般秩序、</p>
<p>陶氏被殺之後、更引起整個歐洲的不安、假使德意志眞有挑戰的企圖、則乘機合併奥國、在事實上非不可能、因爲一衛國團」團員中、寄充分同情於國社黨、贊成德奥合併的人數還相當得多、但是直接支持奥國獨立的是意大利、如果希特勒要硬幹的話、首先就難免不和意國衝突、同時法國·捷克·以及其他歐洲有關係的國家、都很明顯的主張奥國獨立、德國起而挑戰、將絶没有後援、没有一個有力的與國、於是問題發生了以後、德國不敢再伸手、祇好任其自然變化、不過奥大利是歐洲禍亂的新火藥庫、隨時有引起大禍的可能、現在的鎭定、是人工鎭靜劑的效果、暫時的苟安而巳、（七月三十一日於柏林）</p>

<p>閘北繁榮漸復</p>
<p>王彬顔之談話</p>

<p>大通社記者、昨晨特赴閘北梅園路滬北商界王彬彦寓所、親訪王氏、當承延見、記者首叩以報載市公用局、擬在閘北規劃通行電車、該項計劃、有否所聞、當據王氏謂閘北通駛有軌電車計劃、不始於今日、當去年春間、陸伯鴻·徐春榮·（南市水電公司創辦人）主張頗烈當時並徵求本人亦加入發起、·嗣因市府方面、已有整個復興閘北計劃、陸君等當以政府舉辦、自必較商辦爲完善、故未便越俎、此事遂趨岑寂、</p>

<p>丨丨答張一雁君丨丨</p>
<p>第二個問題，在張君也還是徧於形式的看法。個人生活的出路與大衆的出路是應統一起來着眼的。一個有高尙理想的人他决不是離開了實踐生活，去對「理想」作夢。有了「理想」不是就要丢掉「凡俗」，恰恰相反，理想是要通過現實纔能實現的。有好多的人，他看了現實不及理想的光明，他就設法逃避現實，這種人，他不獨不能實現其現想，結果反會回轉來與現實妥恊。不然，就只是一種空想。在辛刻革命時有的人，以爲要革命就等於去出家，自己有職業就不能同時革命。不然，就是先辭去職業。但他們仍說革命是他的理想。他們是這般形式的把革命同實際分開。在革命中，固然需要革命的組織者，他不能不專心革命上，但這種人只能佔革命中最最小的比例，廣大的革命羣衆都是自己一面「四處找食」，一面爲理想奮鬥。個人的生存與奮鬥的目的，本是常相衝突的呀！並且，如果一旦離開實際去空談革命，那恐怕一世也不會成功。至於求學也是一樣，職業技能與文學社會科學是可以按照個人生活實際去學習的。關於這一點，我們最近又在「學習理論與學習技術」一文中討論過了。張君因爲把生活與理想分開了，於是才有「先求文學，繼之社會科學」的抽象的决定，完全看不起職業技能。等到要變爲「餓殍」了，於是「不得不放棄文學或社會科學，專心去謀養生的技術。」這雖然不能說是張君的完全的失敗，却無疑的是犯了形式論理的錯誤。張君不能把學文字與社會科學在實際生活中去規定。爲什麽不一面學習文學社會科學，一面學習生活技術呢？爲什麽不一面維持自己最低生活，一面爲自己的理想去奮鬥呢？這些東西本來不是絶對對立的，而是自己因他弄得絶對了。</p>
<p>張君還說，「我要盡力擠到大衆生活隊裏去，才先要磨練我自己的筋骨，訓練我的學問。」在大體看來是正確的，但這仍是一種幻想。因爲我們不是先磨練筋骨好了，才能走入大衆生活隊裏，學問預備得好了，才出世做事，我們只有到大衆生活中去才能磨練出筋骨，只有在實際中，才能得到眞的學問。我們要抗日，無論何時何地，任何職業都可以，不一定要辭去職業，跑到東北去方是抗日，先研究好了日本爲什麽要侵略中國的學問，才去抵日，這種觀點如果不是滑頭，故意欺人的謊話，就是自己太樸素了。</p>
<p>旣然如此，我們對於生活自然是極力降低私生活水凖向着理想之途邁進，自然這一過程是戰鬥的連續，艱難困苦的一步步達到目的的，那怎會有固個人的要求不滿而至「阻礙前途，頽喪意志」呢？</p>
<p>至於張君提出的第三問題，說因「受不了不同的剌激，使不安工作。」看了「一個爲經濟壓迫而自殺的靑看」，就氣得面紅耳赤，這完全是近於感情用事。我們對於這類的事雖然不能、視同不聞」，但不是一氣即了的。這些剌激只有使我們更加明白現實，那會阻礙靑年的前進呢？</p>
<p>總之：張君的態度，我們認爲非常誠懇與直率，值得特别的敬意的。但張君到底像我們一樣都還是稍有飯吃的人，所以一切的看法，有時總不免帶着我們這種不上不下生活氣氛。其實，世間原無路，路都是人走開的。怎樣奮鬥，在别人仍祗能提示其原則與方法，如何去走，這完全要按照你的生活實踐，我們已一再說過丨。我們希望張君讀這封信時，同時檢讀以前各篇文字，從速克服自己的煩悶，我出奮鬥的途徑。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼戰一車關中來遠客家徒四農渡口吊衆人</p>
<p>他這樣的說着，跳下車來，早有兩個茶房上前，替他搬運行李。張李二人跟了進去看時，乃是一所兩進的四合樓房，這樓下面，還有幾間磚房，樓上却完全是木柱與木壁，樓土有人走路時，樓板樓壁，一齊都震動得咚咚作響。依着茶房的意思，就要把他的行李搬到樓下兩關房裏去。李士廉連連搖着手道：這個吃不銷。茶房道：那末，就搬到後院平房裏去罷，不過價錢要費一點。張介夫道：五塊錢一天嗎？茶房笑道：那要許多，一塊幾毛錢就是了。張介夫道：一塊幾毛錢，這有什麽了不得？茶房聽說，又看看他們這情形，分明是政界人物，也許是眞的不在乎，於是就搬着行李，引他們到後面院子裏去。這院子裏，有一列磚牆蓋的平房，前後開了兩個長方形的玻璃窗戶，又有一扇半截玻璃門，這勉强也算是洋式房子了。李士廉先伸頭看了看木壁掛的旅館規則，本房間却是一元二角。他立刻在心裏計劃着，我在這裏，至少也要住一個月，長期的住，不打個七折，也可以打個八折，一七得七，二七一角四，共起來不過是九角四分錢。看看屋子裏，有一張黑木桌子，兩把椅子，兩個方凳，還有一張七成舊的鐵床。比較的說，總還可以安身，於是就呌茶房安頓了行李，和張介夫比屋而居。茶房因他已經住下了，第一件事，便是送上一根藍布撣子來。李士廉始而還不知道作何用的，還是看到張介夫站在院子裏，用了這個撣子，週身撣着塵土，這才明白過來。果然的，在西北這地方，進門來第一件事，就是要撣灰。（九）</p>
<h3 id="c221">禦倭的碉堡 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 徐絜</p>
<p>在明嘉靖（世宗）三十三年，倭寇來擾江浙兩省，姦淫殺掠，咱們江</p>
<p>浙的百姓，吃了倭寇不少的苦楚。他們擾亂我國的宗旨，近於海盜的行逕，没有像現下日本人的野心呀。到了嘉靖四十二年，倭陷平海，戚繼光擊破之，後來也慢慢地平定了。</p>
<p>戚繼光是平倭寇的功臣，這是大家都知道的。但，這時候，各地擊殺倭寇的人是很多，通州，蘇州，寗波等處，也都辦起士兵來，和官兵同心恊力來抗拒。因爲百姓切膚利害的關擊，那裏可以全委責於政府身上呢。現在各地還有許多碉堡的存在，便是抗拒倭寇的紀念品呢。</p>
<p>像慈谿的觀海衛，是一所小城，奉化松嶴，南臨家山港，所以也有一個碉堡。蘇州木凟白塔橋堍，有所敵樓，廣闊十三丈，高三丈六尺，樓基用白石造成，四面的牆，都用磚砌成各種花紋：旁邊有許多小洞，是射擊槍彈用的。樓的四周，山明水秀，風景很好，說是木凟十景之一；不曉得當時在那裏殺了不少的倭寇。</p>
<p>原來這時倭寇從楓橋，到木凟，西山等地，騷擾進來，沿途焚燒搶刦，無所不至，兵備任環和總兵湯克寛，率兵攻剿，倭寇逃入太湖，擾亂東西洞庭，後來又擾靈巖，任環率兵趕到，在這敵樓下，殺寇很多。現在蔣委員長在江西剿共，也用「碉堡政策」，收了很大的效果。不曉得咱們將來抵禦外侮，還有甚麽好方法呢？咱們做小百姓的，也應該「未雨綢繆」纔是！</p>

<h3 id="c223">徵兵舊話 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>日前讀茸餘君所撰之「從軍歌」，内有「不過那些徵兵們的籌命很短，因爲他們瞧不起綠營的腐敗，而綠營兵也受不住他們的架子，同駐一地，常常因細故而發生械鬥，那時的朝廷，終於是不歡喜新式，所以便把他們解散」等語，與事實上稍有不符處，籌成係當時徵兵之一，知之較詳，爰將情形追述如下：</p>
<p>光緒三十二年春，江蘇舉辦徵兵制，向蘇松太三屬徵兵千五百餘人，到蘇後，因西園對河之營房未竣工，各隊分駐城内外舊營房與各廟宇，卽照蘇松太三屬而編爲一二三營，稱曰江蘇陸軍第二標。寳帶橋北首之綠營，曰第一標。（該標營房卽一二八之役因改建飛機塲而拆去）予隸於二標一營前隊，充八棚副目，（初入營尙無正目）管十四人，駐於鎭撫使前老郎廟内。其時三屬應徵者，程度不一，有已入黌門之秀才，有向在學校之學生，有紈褲子弟，有少爺流氓，穿黄布操衣，招搖過市，當地流氓退避三舍，驢夫車夫奉如神明，而稱之曰徵兵老爺。晚飯後，由排長隊官率隊在大街小巷遠足，均唱「進兮進兮」與「天下雄丈夫爭戰功」之軍歌，沿途居民，均扶老携少，倚門而望。第一標綠營，則仍頭纏黑布，身披號褂，外出須持三尺長之號牌，兩相比較，確有天汑淵之隔。當時之巡撫陳夔龍，偕督練處三總辦，時集合徵兵訓話，故對於軍紀上，僉自知注意。一日二標三營内有人大胥門外洋橋塊。見第一標内之兵士，手持號牌，而在馬路上與雉妓調笑，認爲妨碍軍紀，上前制止。渠等因上峯對於一二兩標待遇不平，正在尋事，借此遂回營煽惑，結隊外出，與徵兵尋釁，遇人卽打，甚到被其刦去二人，打傷後溺於葑門外，厥後於第一標内，捉去兇首二人，在王廢基正法，以償被溺者之命。茸餘君所謂械鬥者，諒卽指此事。是年冬入營房後，管理漸嚴，三屬人士因生活太苦，相率潛逃者，約佔十分之七，當局無法可想，乃向徐淮海一帶招募以補缺額。籌成其時已考入陸軍隨營學校，越三年徵兵退伍，僅百餘人，故茸餘君所稱解散，則有不符之處，恐時久事湮，特表而出之。</p>
<h3 id="c224">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>御林軍的差使也是不容易當的！他們的任務，雖然是要防護，巡察，警戒；但行動又必須十分留神，一不可高聲談笑，二不可使走路的聲音太高，否則就難免隨時有所斫頭的危險。所以待太后安歇之後，四周便像死一般的沉寂。雖然我們打車窗裏望出去，還可以隱約見到遠處鄉村人家的燈火，在地平線上閃動，但人聲是絶對不聽見了，連犬吠聲，蟲鳴聲，也一些都没有：空氣中滿佈着一種肅靜嚴峭，像冰一樣冷的氣息。便在這一種罕有的空氣之下，我們的太后，竟極安適地度過了一宵。</p>
<p>第二天清早，太后便起牀了：伊尋常也是起牀得很早的，如今到了車上，精神尤較興奮，起牀便格外的早了。伊起牀之後，怱怱梳洗了一番，就忙着吩咐開車，於是這一列黄色的火車，便在晨光熹微中出動了。車行不久，天上忽然下起雨來，但也不大，只是很細很細的毛毛雨：假如我們在這雨中行走，卽使不用傘，衣服也是决不會濕透的，至多略覺潮潤而已。這種細雨，在春季裏最多，往往一天下幾次，大概也是時令的關係吧？</p>
<p>這個時令，便是「清明」；所謂「清明時節雨紛紛，」眞是一句最確切的寫實詩。每逢清明節，我們當子孫的總得帶着酒菜，紙錢等等，很恭敬地走到祖先的墳上去行掃墓禮，這是中國各地處處皆然的一種風俗。因此，當我們這列車行經荒野的時候，一路上不知道見到了多少的人，冒着雨，正在向他們的祖墳膜拜，他們都和鐵路離得很遠！（一一八）</p>
<p>像這們一頂破雨傘應付得了將要來襲的狂風暴雨嗎？</p>

<p>— （楊餘聲）</p>
<p>二十世紀的蚊蟲眞也刁怪得可以！以前，人們祇知蚊蟲會飛，現在竟能進化到會爬！</p>
<p>羅帳深沉，它能夤緣而進，伏在人體感覺比較遲鈍的部份，吮吸血液，這是個中超等角色！</p>
<p>其次，夤緣之術雖說欠，難作入幕之賓，但感覺是很敏銳的；它知道帳中目的物的頭和足的部位，潛伏帳外等着。頭部或足部不能說没有接觸到羅帳的時候，因此它們的肚皮也常是吃得飽飽的！</p>
<p>超等角色的本領雖高，但所蹈的危險也很大；這正合乎「爬得高，跌得重」的一句古話。當那目的物一覺醒來，眼看到帳頂上停留着許多架透明血色的「汽球」，報復的觀念忿激，着他立即判處，它們「赤族」的極刑。這時，它們各個拖着「飽和」的肚皮，頓失飛爬活躍的精神，落得個粉身碎骨的下塲！</p>

<h3 id="c226">夏天在黄鶴樓 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>眞如浮雲一樣，五年的時日就是那麽不着痕跡地過去了，不過每逢夏天，我便會想起黄鴻樓呢。</p>
<p>講起黄鶴樓的本身，遊過的人都可以知道，並没有像理想中的那般美好，可是旣然成爲一個名勝，總還不會毫無可取，所以當我們的船到漢口的兩小時之後，我便作了一度中世紀的古跡的巡禮，這時我雖没有古人那種登高作賦的雅懐，但在憑欄低矚的一刹那間，却也異常感興，更學愉快的便是我當時竟定下了在黄鶴樓過夏的計劃。關於這，自然不能如達官名流到莫干山或是去靑島那樣地簡單，且間自然還夾雜着種種必然的原因，並不是本人有那一筆閒餘的金錢，更不是有那麽一份優閒的歲月，不過說來話長，且是題外，暫置不提。</p>
<p>那麽我說，那年夏天我就在黄鶴樓上住下來，清早起身之後便行過那個著名的鵝字碑，當我第一次走過時，我並没有覺得這個鵝字寫得多麽有勁，祇一味地感到王羲之眞會開玩笑。相命館，照相館，更是黄鶴樓的特産，大致中國人都是那麽富於詩情，施罷名跡，也會興嘆着勝地難再，需要留下一個花下隱士式的相片，於是爲適應這一項的需要，小小的一片黄鶴樓的山脊上山坡上照相館竟開了二三十爿之多，也可說是猗歟盛哉了。講到相命館裏，更是扁額横斜，字畫滿牆，窗明几凈，自號什麽居士的先生坐在當中，等會自有人兒送錢來化。　　黄鶴樓後頭還有一個公園，園裏的紀念堂水泥欄杆今都失修了，這個失修的緣因我想大概地和古銅茶壺一樣地，記得傳說上有一個什麽人玩古成性，一天在市間購得一隻唐人的銅爐，欣然地招親延友，一起玩賞，誰知有一個女人家就呌不識貨，說這銅爐又髒又歪，一點都没有什麽好看，但是爐主却又重重地聲言說好就在這點髒，假如不髒還成古物？值錢的就是道一點髒，自然，那女人聽了還要反駁說糞缺板也很髒······不過這裏已經不敢多說了，我要說的就是：大概這裏紀念堂的敗壞正是名勝之所以成吧。</p>
<p>我住的房間是一家著名照相館匀給我的，在樓上，推窗可以望見武昌的全景，扭轉脖子去也可以看到冒着黑烟的漢口，以及江心活動着的大小船隻，但我眞怕這麽做去，因爲我俯首一看，街上是炎熱的太陽，太陽裏行走着神色忽忙的行客，我眞不懂，不懂人生爲什麽老是這麽忙碌？更不知人生心碌了些什麽？</p>
<p>黄鶴樓上的游客差不多從早到晚是川流不息的，但是作爲這個名勝的寄生的男人或妇人也是没有一刻不存在着的斷了腿子的乞丐在地上哭着碰頭，脂粉獨多的窰姐兒老是用那一副變相的拉夫手段，對付着遊客猶如當兵的對付鄉曲，照相的更是彼此爭逐着，祇有算命的先生是清閒的，但是他的心裏誰能擔保他不爲生活而爲着急得愁腸百結望眼欲穿呢？</p>
<p>勝地啊，勝地啊！</p>
<p>這世界上一片凈潔的地土都没有的。</p>

<p>統制與能力統制、」謂統制經濟問題、在當今日中國之内憂外患、農材經濟破壞時、實係一重要問題、故年會論文總題、即爲「中國施行統制經濟政策之商確」而吾今請將本題放大一點即經濟統制與能力統制、乍看似兩種實共相輔助、談及經濟統制意義、即國家經濟與國民經濟、事實需要上定有一種方案、如政府經營事業、與國民經營事業、並行一道、此在發展一國經濟、於人類社會之進步中、必走之路古代經濟、係一種部落的、社會組織經濟條件極簡單、以後一時代進步一時代、經濟乃呈競爭狀態、而亦互採競爭方針、在斯過程中、因小不敵大、無組織不敵有組織、故小的無組織的漸漸的消滅下去、迄於近代、經濟力量、益發膨大、它除本身進展而外、還可以操縱到政治外交、國際貿易等等、故美國政治力量不在華盛頓而在紐約銀行界、他們能以獨佔的經濟力量來左右政治、故歐洲人都不願從事政治、而願從事經濟、往年余嘗赴美參觀、見其經濟團體之組織極嚴密且廣泛。如内部有交通法　等顧問、其對减低運費與法律上種種、均多帮助、甚至國會選舉、該團體對候選人之調查亦極注意、以將來當選後能帮助該團體經濟活動與立塲者、即予以經濟上之援助、使之當選、否則轉予以破壞、由此觀之、經濟力量影響於政治者甚大、此外於金融貨幣市面等、都能以有力的經濟團體來把握、使適於人民希望之各種經濟需要、因此經濟統制、與人民生活有關係者、由政府指導帮助歐洲國家、許多有關係事業、悉由政府支配調劑工是以各國得臻於富强、在中國近年狀况、經濟統制尤爲亟圖、如國防上各種原料以及商品原料、皆以便宜價格運往國外、農産品以經濟未能統制、人民所受到的苦楚與影響甚大、諸如此類、吾輩以學者立塲來研究、第一個問題、是有了統制經濟方案、是否能實行與做到、否則方案等於零、由此第二個問題乃生、即經濟須統制、而人的能力、亦應予以統制、故某種事業之推進、必須某種人有其應備之智識與條件、然後始克順利進行、反是、縱有方案而無有能力人才、欲其收某事業之效果、豈非忘想、遇事知辦法而能辦、即是能力、用小的精神、收大的效果、以少的辦法、做多的事業、收多的效果、此之謂能力、譬如甲學政治、乙舉經濟、丙南工程、如以其各人所學、相互調動去辦未知事業、則收效定毫無、苟以其所學任之、則必能表現其能力、如某事業余固不懂、當先以時間研究、務使能懂後、再任此事、如是則時間旣砂費、且時代齒輪前進不已、他日學成、則時過境遷、所學又非所用、如此做法、精神去的多、而收效亦極少、故經濟統制解决民生問題、亦應顧到人民能力的表現、有大才用以做大事業、小才用以做小事業、於是各種人都能使用其能力、時間旣不消耗、共同努力的結果、收效必非常宏大、故談到能力統制、（一）注重敎育與訓練、可分爲高等和普通、普通者使其就並通事業服務、高等人才出、則使之辦高等事業外更注意基本事實訓練、如社會方面、須施行統計、於是可知國内外、高等和普通人才之所寄、隨時可使、發揮其能力、（二）能力分配問題、在人才與事業俱備之時、支配至爲重要、如支配專門家與普通人、各以其能力所及、則至少於事業上能力都可盡其用、上述原則、用之於統制經濟、不但不矛盾、且相得益彰、故以土地與勞力論之、土地屬經濟、勞力屬能力、此意義可相互發表、英自由黨一九二八年所定之統制經濟方案、如産業統制、金融統制、係屬於經濟方面、勞動統制、即屬於能力、故統制經濟、不僅及本身、各方都須顧到、務使全國人都能以其能力大規模的大範圍的做其能做之事業、不使其勞力精神時間消耗浪廢、如一日專以其能力專做一事、則此事之收效必大、如一日而兼做數事、其能力不及、收效賞微、根據上述問題進行、統制經濟問題之解决、可期實現、而各事如此做去、當亦可博得很好效果云云、</p>

<p>丨在上海市第四届暑期講習學校演講丨</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>各位先生、今天兄弟承上海市敎育局之請、到此演講、甚爲愉快、今天天氣太熱、我不願多說廢話、多費諸位的時間、我今天所要講的題目、就是「民族復興中之公民敎育問題」、</p>
<p>我講這個題目、大概有幾個動機、第一、諸位都是從事敎育的人、而這個學校的目的、又專在研究各種敎育問題、兄弟對於敎育學素乏專門研究、故對敎育問題、不敢多講、不過我是研究政治學的人、大家知道政治學與敎育不能完全分離、而尤其是公民敎育問題、與政治學的關係更深、其次、我還有一個最重要的原因、就是我近幾年來、無論是演講或作文、我都有一個中心思想、就是民族主義、所以我敢說、至少我自己要相信我是澈頭澈尾的一個民族主義的熱烈信仰者、故覺得民族復興中之公民敎育問題非常重要、就趁今日這個機會來對大家貢獻一點意見、復次、我記得上星期在民衆敎育館演講、曾經很簡單的講到公民敎育的要旨、當時因時間關係未及詳細講述、早想把他補充、今日得有機會、可比較詳細的來和大家研究、深爲快慰、</p>
<p>一·公民敎育的重要</p>
<p>我覺得一個民族的生存、其最重要的動力、就是他的國民、照政治學的原理來講、一個國家的構成、是有三個要素、一是領土、一是主權、一是人民、而我以爲、遭三個要素中、最重要的就是人民、因爲領土與主權、是要靠人民去維持牠、保障牠的、要是没有人民、或雖有人民、而牠的人民没有健全的力量、則所謂領土與主權、必致名存案亡、所以人民可說是國家的唯一要素、</p>
<p>那末怎麽樣才能使人民眞正的成爲國家的唯一要素呢、這就是要靠我們負敎育責任的人、去訓練他們、然後他們才能眞正的與國家發生關係、我們中國民族、到現在這個階段、可以說已到了空前的萬分危險困難的時期、在此萬分危險困難的時期中、救國的方法固然很多、不過最重要而基本的、還是要靠我們爲國家唯一要素的人民、然而現在中國的人民、到底能够與國家發生密切的關係不能、到底能够有力量去維持領土保障主權不能、又到底有維持領土保障主權的勇氣和責任心没有、這些都是異常嚴重而急待補救的問題、</p>
<p>我們就表面上看起來、中國的人民很多、有四萬萬之多、世界任何那一個國家、都不及中國、照道理來講、有這許多人民就應該發生極大的力量、可是事實上不然、中國是全世界没有力量的一個國家、拿比利時來說、她是世界上極少的國家、她的領土、不過像中國的幾縣那樣大、而她却能在歐戰時、抵抗她的强鄰、世界上最强的陸軍國德國、就足以證明她國家雖小、而她的力量却十分强大、我們中國素以地大物博人衆聞於世、爲什麽會没有力量、爲什麽會如此衰落、而發生這樣嚴重的國難呢、我是最不喜歡恭維人家、也最不願菲薄自己民族的、某國有個人、我姑且不指其名、有句話說得我們不痛不癢、他說中國雖有四萬萬人、然而在這四萬萬人之中要找出一個像歐美各國、或日本那樣健全的公民却一個也没有、這話固然是太看輕了我們、菲薄了我們、侮辱了我們、但是我們虚心的反省一下、也應該深自警覺、我國的人民、其遺具健全公民資格者、無可諱言的、實在爲數很少、中國就因爲眞正健全的公民不多、所以國家不能發生力量、而民族的精神、也日趨衰微、</p>
<p>所以我們今後救國的方案、最主要的、就要從訓練公民着手、訓練公民使他們每個人都發生力量、爲國家努力奮鬥、使他們每個人都與國家發生密切關係、與國家凝成一起、這樣四萬萬人才有四萬萬人的力量、否則、人民對國家漢不相關、人民的心目中、不知有國家、非但不知如何來盡國民對國家的責任、並且還要妨碍國家的生存、外溢民族的利權、此種與國家毫無關係甚且還要妨害民族生存的人、就不能算是國家的公民、就不能爲國家發生力量、所以我們要救國就先要把全國四萬萬人都訓練爲公民、這就非提倡和普及公民敎育不可、公民敎育最簡單的說、就是要敎育人民知道如何來盡國民對國家的責任、使國民與國家打成一片、這樣一個國民才能發生一個國民的力量、集合四萬萬人的力量成爲一個最偉大的力量、我們有了這種偉大的力量、才能解救空前的國難、創造民族的新生命、</p>

<p>— 蒼</p>
<p>高過時人一籌，本不是太難的事。無論當詩人，小說家，盡家，以及什麽家，這道理是的確的。</p>
<p>因爲時下的文學界藝術界原來没有幾個「巨物」，稍有天才的容易出現。如某人說過：無鳥之鄉，編蝠亦自可喜。所以「文學家」之類很容易出名。</p>
<p>名性本空，依其事業而存在。凡人想成就着其所操持的，必無暇使自己有名，無心力顧及其名。如其名于其事業有損，就逃名，隱名，唾棄牠。正如賽跑的人，有着錦標在前，必無睱管看客或回頭望同跑者。</p>
<p>及至故意做的好看一點，使大家高興，原來爲求名而得各，那是「阿世」者流，也呌「欺世」。也很容易得名的，因爲鑒賞者批評者流也没有幾個「巨物」。或有巨物而又爲旁的緣故，不說話，讓他們閙去了。</p>
<p>許多剛出名的作家，原來很有遠大的希望，徒因好名之故，自己弄的非常可憐。這麽，怕得罪于主子，那麽，怕不合時宜，更那麽，也怕不像了某主義某派的樣子。與時俗依違，在時俗的喜怒下討生活，結果，膠成了科學室的標本似的，標題曰XX家，不能奮飛。</p>
<p>凡人總不能抹殺自己的情感，所以于毁譽自不能没有容心，不過太顧忌也不行，還是不管的好。有怨必報，有譽必笑，是多麽大的奢費和損傷，譬如提倡小品文而賦「渡河」，討論大衆語而怨飄瓦，亦皆有損「性靈」，名之爲累也！</p>
<h3 id="c280">沙漠上慘痛的回憶 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 曹冷泉</p>
<p>在那一片焦土和沙漠的西北，我曾挨了八年艱苦的生活。那延長三四年的旱災，和種種奇變，我都經歷過。許多同胞因此慘死，而我還能苟延生命，自己眞覺得萬分徼倖了。在那些時候我常常想：「西北的飯已經不够吃了，我還來吃！」因此任何奢望也都烟消。</p>
<p>從民國十六年到二十三年，西北也不曾暢快地下一次雨，廣大的平地山邱，赤紅着臉，似乎有所憤怒，很難看見一點靑綠的植物。驕陽兇狠狠地放出火光，硬要燒死地面的一切。有時狂風忽起，漫天的塵沙，一望昏黄，使人疑是世界末日的來臨。</p>
<p>那幾千萬災患中的羣衆，爲了生存仍不息地與自然掙扎拚命；他們流着汗從幾十丈的井裏汲取一點清水來灌田，（西北各處往往掘到幾十丈才能得水。）終於像一杯水澆在熱鍋裏，不禁得一下子蒸發！禾苗是枯槁了，血汗是白流了。驕陽煎迫着他們，使他們成千成萬的死。死是他們惟一的解脫。</p>
<p>民國十八年是西北災患最嚴重的一年，旱災，寒災，兵災，狼災，鼠災，色色俱備。此外並有飢餓的軍隊挨戶搜糧，銀羣餓了，集隊出山捕食人畜。</p>
<p>麵一塊錢三斤，炭一塊錢七斤，人生的資源這樣的缺乏。因此有許多人藉政治力量剝奪别的生命而保全他們自己生命。無告的災民睡在街頭吞食黄土，勉强度命。我也曾親見過。</p>
<p>那年十二月中旬，許久不雨的天，忽降了一塲大雪，烏鴉，雀子成羣的凍死了。晚間那班流離失所的災民，往往三五成羣地團臥在人家大門道前，第二天早上已成堆死在那兒。一不當心，往往掽到僵尸。因此有些人家往往將門道堆雪以防災民偷臥！門道堆雪以防災民偷臥！人類的同情都滅絶了！</p>
<p>在那次大雪中生命的犧牲眞不知幾許。幸存的災民手足凍落的在西安市上到處可以看見。他們成行成列的，有的手足上的筋肉已凍爛而剝落盡了，骨節還如人體骨骼標本般連續着。有的四肢完全凍落了，紫紅浮腫的肉中露出白骨，四肢痛得不敢觸地，坐着慘呼。</p>
<p>飢餓，嚴寒，酷熱，以及官紳的敲剝，加速那一羣人生命的消滅。同時軍閥的混戰更時時掀起恐慌。在那三年間僅陜西一省，聽說已有三百萬無辜的百姓便這般的慘死。</p>
<p>這樣悲慘的犧牲，比綏拉菲維支所寫的「鐵流」的一羣，還要悲痛。然而僅是一塲悲痛而已，代價在那裏呢？</p>
<h3 id="c281">門外文談 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（六）於是文章成爲奇貨了</p>
<p>文字在人民間萌芽，後來却一定爲特權者所收攬。據「易經」的作者所推測，「上古結繩而治」，則連結繩就已是治人者的東西。待到落在巫史的手裏的時候，更不必說了，他們都是酋長之下，萬民之上的人。社會改變下去。，學習文字的人們的範圍也擴大起來，但大抵限於特權者。至於平民，那是不識字的，並非缺少學費，只因爲限於資格，他不配。而且連書籍也看不見，中國在刻版還未發達的時候，有一部好書，往往是「藏之秘閣，副在三館」，連做了士子，也還是不知道寫着什麽的。</p>
<p>因爲文字是特權者的東西，所以牠就有了尊嚴性，並且有了神秘性。中國的字，到現在還很尊嚴，我們在牆壁上，就常常看見掛着寫上「敬惜字紙」的簍子：至於符的驅邪治病，那是靠了牠的神秘性的。文字旣然含着尊嚴性，那麽，知道文字，這人也就連帶的尊嚴起來了。新的尊嚴者日出不窮，對於舊的尊嚴者就不利，而且知道文字人們一多，也會損傷神秘性的。符的威力，就因爲這好像是字的東西，除道士以外，誰也不認議的緣故。所以對於文字，他們一定把持歐洲中世，文章學問，都在道院裏；克羅蒂亞（Ｋroatla）,是到了十九世紀，識字的還只有敎士的，人民的口語，退步到對於舊生活剛够用。他們革新的時候，就只好從外國借進許多新語來。</p>
<p>我們中國的文字，對於大衆，除了身分，經濟這些限制之外，却還要加上一條高門檻；難。單是這條門檻，倘不費他十來年工夫，就不容易跨過。跨過了的，就是士大夫，而這些士大夫，又竭力的要使文字更加難起來，因爲這可以使他特别的尊嚴，超出别的一切平常的士大夫之上。漢朝的楊雄的喜歡奇字，就有這毛病的，劉歆想借他的「方言」稿子，他幾乎要跳黄浦。唐朝呢，樊宗師的文章做到别人點不斷，李賀的詩做到别人看不懂，也都爲了這緣故。還有一種方法是將字寫得别人不認識，下焉者，是從「康煕字典」上查出幾個古字來，夾進文章裏面去；上焉者是錢坫的用篆字來寫劉煕的「釋名」，最近還有錢玄同先生的照「說文」字樣給太炎先生抄「小學答問」。</p>
<p>文字難，文章難，這還都是原來的；這些上面，又加以士大夫故意特製的難，却還想牠和大衆有緣，怎麽辦得到。但士大夫們也正願其如此，如果文字易識，大家都會，文字就不尊嚴，他也跟着不尊嚴了。說白話不如文言的人，就從這里出發的；現在論大衆語，說大衆只要敎給「千字課」就够的人，那意思的根柢也還是在這里。</p>
<h3 id="c282">被逐出了藝術之宮 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>我在八九歲時，對於繪畫就發生了興趣，進了中學我還是愛這一項，一位圖畫敎師曾給過我全級中最高的分數，當時我打算做個畫家，後來終於在蘇州考進了一所藝術學校。</p>
<p>但是一走進藝術學校，把我弄得眼花了。</p>
<p>走在洋樓的甬道上，呆瞪着那些神氣活現的男同學，艶裝嬌態的女學生，聽着披亞娜，梵啞鈴，我的心飄忽在音樂風裏了。</p>
<p>每天走進校門，凝望着一長方題着「藝術之宮」Ｐalace　ofart的大匾，一顆稚弱的心驚跳地；</p>
<p>丨宏偉巨麗的藝術之宮呵！</p>
<p>我聽見嬌貴的同學們那麽讚賞着。</p>
<p>於是我低下着頭，怯怯地，徘徊在藝術宮中了。</p>
<p>綠窗寫畫的生活，何等韻味呵！我消受着藝術宮中的幸福，像微醉了似的，飄忽在音樂風裏，做着幻美的夢，於是也留長髮學畫家。</p>
<p>但是我來是鄉村，出身在窮落的家庭中，終究我是配不得消受藝術宮中詩意的生活的。</p>
<p>終於我被逐出藝術之宮了。</p>
<p>本來我是錯走了路的，不該去公子姐兒的樂園裏。</p>
<p>我的被逐出藝術之宮，自己也無法解釋爲的什麽罪名，流氓式的社會對於一個靑年的摧殘，也有話說嗎？我没有什麽辯解，一個人不死，當將好好努力下去，社會將有一天會明白我的清潔坦白；但是我原不該在象牙塔裏做夢，那是自己明白了。</p>
<p>没有留戀，我走出了藝術之宮。</p>
<p>再會！嬌貴的朋友們！</p>
<p>夢醒覺之後，深重的痛苦襲着我，雨色的風，把我吹得像黄昏裏一盞飄忽的路燈，惘然在十字街頭了。</p>
<p>茫茫的世界，我走向那兒呢？徬徨在黄昏的街頭，擎着烟蒂兒，是一個年靑的失業人呵！</p>
<p>携着迷茫的哀愁，跋踄在冷漠的世途上，迷茫似黄昏行程中，我忠告着自己：</p>
<p>丨摸過黑夜，明天也許是晴天啦！</p>
<p>載着我二十一年哀傷的心，摸索在暗途上。</p>
<p>被逐出了藝術之宮，我是没有什麽懊惱的；振一下疲倦的精神，走出伸在黄昏裏的暗路，也許是我新生的機會！</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>惠天先生寄來「莉莉·珂貝的睡着了的上海」的譯文，看起來，這纔和茫然對着德文原稿的時候完全兩樣，懂得了，原來是這麽這麽說着。於是，忽又想起了任先生的話，他說這個女孩子！任先生總喜歡呌她女孩子丨在上海住子十多天，雖然很想知道中國的情形，但其實一無所得。然而，據我看來，她對於上海，是已經知道得很清楚了的，「睡着了的上海」，便可以作證。</p>
<p>現在，她已經到北平去了，也許是在那里，她將認出中國的容顔罷？無論如何，我想她此番來華的收穫，比蕭伯納總要多的。蕭是一到上海，就被用汽車載到闊人們的Ｓalon裏，給看新聞記者和名士的嘴臉，過後仍舊被用汽車載回船上，一到北平，也不過在將軍府吃飯，乘了飛機下望長城，長城而已，此外還看到什麽呢？莉莉。珂貝，則在上海乘過黄包車，被污髒的乞丐所追逐，在三等電車上，被同車的人們所鄙夷，也曾去過閘北的工廠，也曾在大世界附近的「野鷄」羣中挨擠···受了新聞記者文人學士們的漢視之賜，她一個子到處亂跑，竟探得了上海的秘密的核心。到了北平，大概還是原樣，那麽，她會得知道中國的。</p>
<p>據說，在日本的時候，是警察作了她的嚮導，倘想着看看農民的生活罷，却被帶到地主的華貴的客廳裏。在上海可没有遇着這樣的嚮導，她因此覺得很僥倖，然而她不知道原因，其實是在於上海根本用不着這樣的嚮導。是本是日本的日本，所以日本的警察有給自己掩飾的義務，但上海是西人所統治的中國的上海，警察爲西人所養，而上海的出醜之處，僅關於中國的體面，所以西人的警察以用不到代爲掩飾。而且掩飾醜惡這工作，大概也只有在日本的都會裏能够做到，在上海，「威利先生」所住的五層樓的架空花園的下面，不就是一條充滿「污髒的水」的運河，而在運河中的舢舨上，睡着中國苦力麽？</p>

<p>後來，生活一天天地困難起來，店子幾乎開不下去。媽呌我不要讀書了，趁着有一個親戚在軍隊裏做官，呌我到他那兒去。至於弟弟呢，他已經十四歲了，只好再呌他讀兩年書，好經理店子，媽也好有替手了。</p>
<p>弟弟這天當我同媽商量的時候，他在門那面悄悄的聽一會就不聲不響地出去賭錢去了。因爲是新年，媽也不管他的。我有時問他：</p>
<p>「弟弟，今年你願意讀甚麽學校？」</p>
<p>「别管我的！」他怔一下大眼睛又走了。</p>
<p>以後那些夥計們便逗他：</p>
<p>「小周！你還賭錢；你哥哥要做官去了！」</p>
<p>弟弟放下牌，横着眼睛說道：</p>
<p>「不稀罕，暍，做官！媽媽的，你也小周小周的，潦你媽的蛋！」</p>
<p>「看你這就不是做官人的樣子！」他們還逗他。</p>
<p>「滾你的媽！」</p>
<p>媽忽然拿着板子出來了：</p>
<p>「我不信，甚麽新年就打不得！哼，你要横豪，等娘閉了眼睛的時候！」</p>
<p>弟弟氣得眼睛發直，拐拐旁邊的王二，把牌一抛，就一溜烟的跑了。</p>
<p>有一天，一個夥計向媽說，他聽見隔壁的王二在跟弟弟商量偷跑呢。媽就趕快把房裏的櫃子打開看，錢是好好的，不曾動過一點，跟着就趕快找一把鎖來鎖上了。上想他没有錢决不敢跑的。况且從來没有出過門的他跟王二，一定不會曉得從哪條路走。呌防着他就是了。</p>

<p>日本帝國主義者當這個所謂「非常時期」，朝野正瘋狂地積極備戰，尤其對於中國的侵略，牠是死也不肯放鬆的，自東北被强佔以後，所謂「滿蒙政策」，更在拚命謀其全部的實現，所以對華已成了日本當前的主要課題，每個日本國民的腦子裏都播植了侵略支那的種子，仇視華人的思想也隨之急劇發達（虧有些寳貝還在高唱什麽「中日親善」丨），棄木花之被殺，並非偶然的現象，乃是整個日本帝國主義者那副猙獰面目的反映。</p>
<p>我們還記得長崎僑胞爲葉案呼籲的電文，對棄君當時被害的慘狀，作過血淋淋的紀述，根據這一血腥的事實，當已澈底暴露了日入的殘酷無人道，請看前後兩日一再尋隙辱駡之不足，最後竟出預藏胸際的七首向葉君左胸猛剌，這種有計劃的兇行，事前必有相當的準備，論情論理，顯係出於有意的預謀殺人；日本法院多方包庇，藉口該兇犯未屆什麽法定年齡而卸責脫罪，是直欲以一手掩盡天下人的耳目，其兇惡態度將益爲世人所明見。</p>
<p>「九一八」事變以前，日本當局藉口所謂「中村事件」，一再向我抗議威脅，究竟中村有無其人，到底曾否失踪，卽云有之，這責任究應歸何方擔負，這一切的一切，至今成爲疑案，然而日人利用此次事件作張本，更加緊一步實行積極的武力侵略，再進而造成「九一八」事變的爆發，强佔我東北數省的領土。不久以前，藏本在南京失踪，日本那種調艦增兵威脅恫嚇的樣兒，如果與葉案兩相對照；一則爲蓄意預謀殺人致死，一則爲故意覓地自殺，使其某種企圖有所藉口，其事態的輕重，固已彰明昭著，盡人皆知。「同樣圓顱方趾的人類，因爲國勢的强弱，其生命價值的輕重竟有這樣懸殊的差别！」眞是可歎。</p>
<p>葉案發生已久，國人至今尙無適當的表示，葉死不足惜，葉爲國受辱而死才可恨，死後證據確鑒而不能達到懲兇賠償道歉諸目的，尤足令人髮指！這案關係整個國家的榮辱，關係旅外華僑生命的安全，中華民族的民氣如尙未消沉殆盡，是應誓死抗爭到底的。年來我國僑胞，隨處受外族的凌辱排擠驅逐屠殺，時至今日，國人如仍不急起掙扎，奮發圖强，人爲刀俎，我爲魚肉，偌大世界的領域，將永無華人立足的餘地。</p>
<h3 id="c287">論「文學遺産」「與洋八股」（續） <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>現在我們先來着他的所謂整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産，是不是「到中國舊文學營壘中去放炸彈」，與替中國文學進行消毒運動的工作？事實回答我們，不是的。第一，在全部「中國文學研究專號」中，我們没有看到一篇文章，甚至一字一句，說他們這一工作，是「到中國舊文學營壘中去炸彈」與替中國文學進行「消毒」運動的工作。有之，在「文學」三卷二號。然而這又在我的那篇所謂「洋八股」發現於本埠增刊之後。這是不是後來追加上去的呢？還是他們當時一時遺忘了？這就有點難以弄得明的。然而他們也會說，這是你自己没有眼睛，我們在「中國文學研究專號中早就「皮裏陽秋」式的說過了。再則，這事也不用明說，在這個時候，來提議得新整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産，當然就包括「到中國舊文學的營壘中去放炸彈」與替中國文學進行「消毒」運動的意義在内了。則我又有何說。</p>
<p>然而事實還是事實。偷兒取到了人家的東西，有人追問，他一定要說，這是拾到的，或是在某處某處怎樣得來的；當然，他一定不會說，這是我在某處偷到的。「文學」的起先很單純的說，我們要　以新的方法，重新整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産；而後補充的說，這是「到中國舊文字的營壘中去放炸彈」。誰又知道，這一定不是偷兒式的閃爍「遁辭」！</p>
<p>然而「文學」一班人還是值得我們佩服的。先說他們的提議整理中國文學遺接受中國文學遺産，是要到中國「舊文學營壘」中去找他們所需要的「金沙」，而後說這一工作，是「到中國舊文學營壘中去放炸彈」，至少，這一點躱閃方法已是十分「難能可貴」的了。</p>
<p>其次，「風」君攻擊我那篇文章、最得意的地方，要算是說我那篇文章是十足的所謂「洋八股」了。這是很有意義的。「風」君說我那篇文章是「洋八股」，這樣一來，我的全部文字，便都完全給他推翻了。這是一個很兇狠很惡辣而又非常巧妙的說法。然而明眼人誰都看得到，這究竟是一種什麽樣的手法。拆穿了說，「風」君也不過學到了一班政治密控最起碼的給人家「戴紅帽子」的方法。這種方法，在我看來，實在起碼得很。「風」君能够說，因爲我那篇文章是「洋八股」，所以「文學」所提議的整理中國文學遺接受中國文學遺産，便無論如何，都不能不說是一樁，有意義的工作嗎？「文學」諸君，能不能這樣的「大胆武胆」？給人家「戴帽子」的方法，這勾當現在也玩得太平凡了。不料「文學」諸君，爲了這一個小問題，也鄭重其事的應用到這一種最起碼最可鄙的方法，這就未免有點可憐。</p>
<p>最有意思的是，「風」君雖然用盡了力量，在證明我那篇文章是「洋八股」，而他自己，却同時也就深深的陷入了「洋八股」的泥淖。不僅是「洋八股」，而且是最最惡劣比「洋八股」尤惡劣的「本八股」。我們看罷：「風」君那篇文章，最得意的地方，是在什麽地方？不過是一些最無聊的從文字上的「尋章摘句」式的批評而已。請問「風」君，這比我的「洋八股」又高明了多少？</p>
<p>「風」君寫那篇文章，態度是秀誇大而嚴厲的。這大概因爲「文學」在國内是比較有地位的雜誌罷，所以他們一舉一動，究竟「比衆不同」些。我的那篇文章，不過因爲一時怱忙中寫成，又經人改過，所以中段文字確有許多不順與拖沓之處。這是難免的。我不是「文學家」，文字上當然有時有許多論爭，我們從來没有看見這種情形。大概「文學」因爲有地位的原故，他們的作家，想來邏輯上</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>必然是「第一流」的。其實你們的東西，現在也未必一定可以雄據「中國文壇」，儘多有眼眼的中國芸芸民衆，他們的眼睛，現在並不朝着你們看。</p>
<p>最後我倒要奉勸「文學」諸君，我看你們這是靜心的安分守己的做些到中國文學遺産中間揀「金沙」的工作好些。本來，那里才是你們「怡情適性」消遣的地方。若一定一手執着中國文學遺産中的「金沙」，一手還要「到中國文學營壘中去放炸彈」，那就未免太使人看了肉麻。然而這是「文學」諸君所萬萬不肯率直承認的。那恕我要說句「誅心」的話，「文學」當初是怎樣繼續維持下來的？</p>
<p>然而最後的最後，我學得「文學」諸君究竟還是值得佩服的。爲的是他們旣可一手「揀金沙」，一手又可「放炸彈」；而同時，又能給人家「帽子」，戴，很快的（也許早就能的）學會了政治密探的本領。這是「文學」諸君的爲我們所萬不及的地方。我的佩服「文學」，就在這兩點。（附記：「文學」三卷二號是八月一日出版的，及至八日左右，才有人告訴我其中有上面那麽一篇攻擊我的文章，接着我又生病，故直到今日，始能作文以答之。特此誌明）。</p>
<h3 id="c288">幽靈的悲哀 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>不知昏迷了多少時候才給凄楚的哭聲驚覺。這哭聲怪熟的，像自己的妻，象自己的媳婦。他納罕好端端的哭什麽？可是一抬眼他發現幾個女尼正在執行超度他的工作，木魚聲有節拍地和着哭聲一記記打在他的心上。</p>
<p>我死了嗎？</p>
<p>他急得直跳起來，他覺得身體輕了許多，看看床上，像放着一面大鏡子；裏面躺着另一個的自己。</p>
<p>他不知道自己是幾時躺在堂前裏，他記不起自己是怎樣死的！他想問妻，問媳婦，可是她們都不理他，像根本不認識他一樣。</p>
<p>是的，自己是走進另一世界了。她們没法看見自己，雖只自己是明明看見他，可是没法使她知道自己是立在她面前。</p>
<p>他感到死别的悲哀。</p>
<p>飄飄地從妻身邊走過，從媳婦身邊走過，從女尼身邊走過，他走出了堂前向自己的家走去。</p>
<p>走廊下他看見自己的三個兄弟紅着眼睛在講他的死因，於是他就靜靜地坐在對面的空椅上聽着。</p>
<p>從兄弟口中他知道自己是害中風死的，和大姊一樣，死得很快，僅僅三個鐘頭。</p>
<p>他又說起他的大姊，和自己一樣胖的大姊，她死的那年也是五十四，當自己去弔祭的那夜，睡在床上看見她老在自己的四週踱着。</p>
<p>六九五十四，暗九，他時時躭心着，怕自己過不出那一關。</p>
<p>現在證實了，他活到大姊同樣年紀，害着大姊同樣的病。</p>
<p>看看坐在天井裏和走郎裏爲自己遠道趕來的親友們，他們都用驚嘆的口氣講關於自己的死，間接和直接的悲哀，淺深地抹在每個人的面上。</p>
<p>目光在每個人面上掃遍了，我找不到自己的兒子，他們是遠在Ｓ埠，也許還不知道自己是死了。</p>
<p>他的那顆空虚的心隱隱地作痛起來，父子本來是連心的。</p>
<p>飄飄地向走廊那面轉過彎，那是他的家。他用依戀的目光看看房裏的一切。那個他最疼愛的孫子，這時正在嚷餓，他還可憐地說：「阿爺死了，没人買東西我吃？」</p>
<p>他很高興地走過去，摩着孫子的頭、吻着孫子的臉。他在奇怪爲什麽這樣嚷没一人去理他。一抬眼，發現自己的那隻籃放在床邊，於是他愛憐地告訴孫子：那裏面藏着您喜吃的東西，並且用手指給他看。</p>
<p>孫子的嚷聲變成哭聲了，他没覺到自己的存在，還抽咽地呌着：「阿爺死了，没人買東西我吃？」</p>
<p>他的心碎了，在自己心愛人的眼裏已看不見自己，在自己心愛人的耳裏已聽不見自己。他恨萬能的科學家爲什麽不發明傳達生死間思想的工具。</p>

<p>— 佳</p>
<p>忽然想起了故鄉來，不禁悵惘於沉思中了。</p>
<p>有好幾年的時光没曾回鄉，　長長的日子飄浮在異地裏，像一支飄浮在水上的萍藻，流到那兒便捷息到，那兒漸漸地就習慣了流浪者的生涯。對於戀懐故鄉的心也漸漸地淡下去，淡到幾乎糢糊而忘記了。</p>
<p>也會於某種心境下幻出了懐戀的輕影，但這種時候總是很稀少的。不過故鄉在記憶的夢裏永遠是清麗的，美緻的。雖則我故鄉巳經闊别了多年，却時常從自故鄉來的人帶來了故鄉的一些消息，使我知道故鄉已不是如夢中的幻想那樣的情形，而是有了很大的變動，一天不似一天的破碎下去。</p>
<p>可是，在記憶上，故鄉還是美麗值得四味的故鄉呵！</p>
<p>那遊的一切風景物是這裏所不易瞧見的：</p>
<p>人們的生活都是充滿愉快和喜悅，大清早，小麻雀子便啁啾啁啾地站在柘榴樹枝上唱着晨曲，全不須要鐘寺指示時間的遲早。只聽見了那清脆的雀子的嗓音，大家便曉得天亮了，於是溜下床來，各各理着自家這一天應做的事。婦人們帶着衣服牽着孩子到屋前野外的池塘濤洗。淙凈的水聲打池塘嚮上來，雜和着一些說笑的聲音，像黎明的音樂風似的飄向空間。孩子們離去了娘子的身邊，在草地上任意跑動着，捉着蚱蜢，捉到手的時候，便笑盈盈地飛奔到娘的跟前，跳着說着，表示他們快樂得意的心情。</p>
<p>眞是一幅原始樸素的土風圖啊！</p>
<p>洗完了衣服，又帶着孩子回家，孩子走在前邊，巴巴的唱起山歌；娘兒們跟在後頭，互相談笑。沐浴在温柔的陽光下的每張臉龐都是温柔地，而又嘻嘻地。</p>
<p>接着，每家人的屋脊頂上便嬝起了一縷縷的炊烟。孩子們吃過了早飯，一個個上學去了。娘却做着一些輕細的針綫的工作。</p>
<p>記憶着的故鄉是這未靜美，呌人玩味不盡。</p>
<p>然而現實的故鄉怕早就消滅了這靜美了啊！</p>
<p>於是我的眼際又織成一幕黯淡的畫景：</p>
<p>許多人都沉了從前的哭勁兒，老是掛着一面怨苦的愁臉，鬱慘地過着日子，生活的重重的暗雲重重地壓在腦袋上，心靈上，就是聚在一塊的時候，也總是默默地呆住着，種種的煩惱奪去了一切，嘆息和憂思代替了歡快，生活冷酷的抽打，把他們推麽得没一點活氣，思想連身子都被踏瘦了。</p>
<p>也有許多人迫的不得不捨棄了親暱的家，親暱的故鄉，向城市，向别地方尋活去了。於是有許多人家的門便緊緊地閉着没一絲聲息，冷落如古庵一樣，讓蜘蛛織成綱，成了家！！！</p>
<p>一下子就變得那麽凄凉、故鄉呵！</p>
<p>故鄉的美麗，使我更不願意回去。碰着了現實，我的理想的憧憬將如一杯貯滿紅色的葡萄酒的杯子碰着了岸石一下便粉碎了。</p>

<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>白色的風，白色的清冷的氣流，</p>
<p>白色的貧血症的花啊。</p>
<p>（療養院的病房的大窗是開向南方的。</p>
<p>疾病是白的，夢是白的，酒精是白的，藥棉是白的，藥瓶與人注射器是白的，年輕的看護小姐是白的······。</p>
<p>早晨，看護婦捧了一束花進來，放在床前桌子中央的大花瓶裏。香味是窒息的。</p>
<p>丨是什麽呢？</p>
<p>丨意大利的野薔啊，向着南方的太陽而開放的。</p>
<p>閃動着靑春的康健的血色的臉。</p>
<p>意象便飄開去啦，遠遠地，意昧着意大利的南方的太陽，和成廉推爾的張烈酒精味的音樂風。</p>
<p>病人棒着一顆傳奇的心，眼睛在安閒的神色中閉上了。</p>
<p>病的心是需受白色的治療的。）</p>
<p>早上，電車停在漢彌爾頓大厦門口，照例吐出一批人，又吞進一批人便蠢懦地向前爬着漲炎的路程。望着標在車尾的Ｂ２７的數字，自己便給丢在握着大都市的一部份的文化與商業的中心樞鈕的建築物門前了。</p>
<p>走着進去，於是丨</p>
<p>便消失了白天的太陽，便給電梯提上建築物的頂層，便在簽到簿上寫名字，便消受着地下層的白熱燈光，便在打字機上打着「敬啟者」，「來示奉悉」，「呈爲ＸＸＸＸ事」，便在數字的滙集中打着紅藍的記號「·········。</p>
<p>黄昏的時候，站在怱忙的大街上，看車輪的旋轉，交通燈的變換，自我的醒覺便給提起咧：「大都市的集體行動下面的生物，是百分之百的機械化了的，人是齒輪，人是曲槓，人是螺旋釘「。</p>
<p>在機械的構組下面生活着的人，血是衝激的，意志是煩燥的，心臟是急跳的，腦子是硬化的。</p>
<p>然而隱藏在這些後面的，不是生活的鞭子嗎？在生活的鞭子的舞動下，無數的機械化了的心都開了花啦：花是慘白的，肺結核的，神經衰弱的，貧血症的。</p>
<p>蒼白地喘着氣。</p>
<p>（說，心是病了吧？病了的心是需要治療的；可是我討厭扭扭揑揑的醫學的白色，貧血症的患者是討厭慘淡的白色的，就是在療養院也是個討厭機械的重；可是也討厭養息的清閑呢。）</p>
<p>那一個早晨，猛然地看到了剛昇起的太陽，像對奇蹟一樣地驚震着：這一個時候醫學的慘白也帶了一點康健的紅色啦。太陽是不斷地在運動着的，燃燒着的。在不可探測的高温度中，他不斷地動着，生存着，造成了一個個的日子，織成了一本本的歷史。機械的生活又有什麽關係呢？機械是動的，運轉着，摩擦着，連絡着的，於是便發生熱，發生工作的力。這不全是衰弱症的最好的治療嗎？</p>
<p>想着在都市中完成着機械中的另件的任務的，而又有着一顆病着的心的人們，便又想到一座生了銹的機器，機器是病着的：每個零件都停滯啦。燃料是有的，動力也有的，就是缺乏開動它的人；可是在人類，這開動的人便是做着另件的人們自己啊。</p>
<p>如果說，不健康的人應該有一點運動，那末病着的心爲什麽儘讓它靜止着呢？療養院裏的優閒的治療根本病態的，慘白的。康健的象徵該是豐滿的血色啊。</p>
<p>（似乎並不多想地對着病了的心投了一把火，眼前便消失了療養院的優閑的，病態的，醫學上的慘白。）</p>
<p>病了的心是需要治療的；可是這治療是新的，合理的。</p>
<h3 id="c291">靑年與修養 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 洪奔</p>
<p>以我的推想，更經過好幾位老前輩的口證，二三十年前的靑年，都是「少年老成」，「風度泱泱然」，這本是一種時代與社會的反映，二三十年前的中國社會形態，必然要孕育出那麽一般靑年。可是時代進化了，一到現在，眼看完全掉轉了龍頭，靑年人類多浮躁淺薄，視修養爲迂腐，信口唾棄。自然，這也是時代與社會的反映。但是一個没曾學步的小孩。就越程去學跑，豈有不跌交的？</p>
<p>這樣一來，多少人就瞧不起靑年，總在爲着靑年的幼稚病而惋惜。但又誰都有這種企望：靑年的希望很大，靑年的責任尤大，國家社會，將來全靠巿年，此日之靑年，卽他是社會國家的主宰。</p>
<p>然而危險得很！但我半點不鄙視靑年，我自己也正是靑年羣中之一個，</p>
<p>祇感覺自身迫切的危殆，我們實在需要一番修養呵。</p>
<p>在未談修養之前，對現代靑年的一般缺陷，是需要來一番概括的指點。據我看現代一般靑年的缺陷，不在勇猛，而在怯弱，不在衰老，而在浮躁，不在偷閒，而在無恒，不在學識的淺膚，而在没有求智的信心，不在染習惡習，而在没有眞正的嗜好。這樣一來，自然個個都朝向低落的地方走，而無以自㧞。總說一句，現在的靑年，病就在怯弱，因循，不求上進，一味敷衍，眼光近視，得過且過，無論對己，對人，對社會，都是這麽一個態度。結果就經不起風浪，不一會就凋謝了，誰也没有大希望。</p>
<p>我深深的覺得，我們靑年應有下面幾種修養：</p>
<p>第一，把因循苟且的心洗掉，換上認眞負責的精神，這所謂認眞負責，廣言之，就是對自己的人生應認眞負責。</p>
<p>第二，把怯弱保守的心理洗掉，换上冒險剛毅的精神。許多偉大人物與偉大事業是這樣完成的。</p>
<p>第三，「把偷閒的」心除掉，換上求上進的精神。我們靑年其實並没有學得多少，懂得多少，却誰都有三分自滿自足。，要知道浩海般的學問，我們固須一步步的去探索的。</p>
<p>第四，把惡習除掉，換上一種眞正的嗜好。</p>
<p>言盡于此，一筆帶住。</p>

<h3 id="c292">「人猿泰山」主角韋斯摩勒的呼嘯問題 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 阿白</p>
<p>從「人猿泰山」在中國轟轟烈烈的演出之後，對於遺這上帝特别加料製造出來的韋斯摩勒，懐疑他的强健的體魄，揉樹的敏捷，擒獸的技巧，是否出於攝影機的幻變。在擁戴他的愛好游泳的靑年們，以及竊慕他的，崇拜男性「健」與「力」的女性們的口裏，的確是一個時常熱烈討論的問題。</p>
<p>另有一件更爲世界觀衆們所懐疑的，是他的震撼山岳的呼嘯。我們該記得：在「人猿泰山」中這世界游泳錦標保持者没有講過說話，除了所謂我們聽不懂的猩猩語，象語等獸言，以及他的白種情侣裘恩所敎他的「我」「愛」「你」之外，銀幕後傳聲筒所傳送到座上觀衆們耳鼓裏的，僅是他的引吭長嗚和抑揚頓挫的呼嘯。卽呼嘯的高朗，使人幾乎不會想到這是人在喚呌！</p>
<p>在「人猿泰山」完成後之數星期，切欲仰瞻其眞面目的人們的請柬洪水般衝來。韋斯摩勒因爲久不噌社交的滋味，正苦悶得慌。於是他决意保留着米高梅急欲從事「泰山情侶」而嚴禁他剃去的蓬鬆的野人的長髮跨進了好久没有束縛他那魁梧軀幹的晚禮服，去參加宴會了。</p>
<p>當他穩步走到賓客的中間，這六尺三寸長的身體所架着的頭與肩，高出了全屋子的男女，熱烈的掌聲從女性的柔嫩的手上放出，奇疑的目光從男性的眼中對着這蠻牛般的人物放射。</p>
<p>後來有一位富孀抓着韋斯摩勒走向凉臺。清靜慣了的他正苦着人氣的窒塞而感到吸收新鮮空氣的需要，欣然地跟從。但富孀一直帶了他走到花園中，她突然的懇求他說：「泰山，請你呌一聲我聽吧」丨</p>
<p>像富孀般懷疑與好奇的人們，何止千萬。韋斯摩勒曾因觀衆的要求公開的表演。在六千餘靑年會集於羅省的Ｓhrine　Auditorium舉行「靑年週」時，「韋斯摩勒站在全世界最高大的戲臺上，猶豫了一會，鼓起他四十三寸又四分之三闊的胸部吸足了氣。呼聲從他的口裏突然送放，四散傳遞到這舉世惟一的大塲所的任何一角。</p>
<p>韋斯摩勒「人猿泰山」攝製後，已二年有半，這整整的八百餘日，都在扮演米高梅公司劃籌下的「泰山情侶」，據報章的報告，這部比「人猿泰山」更緊張的影片已於四月二十日在美國正式宣佈完成。而電影圈裏的人們亦傳說着此片巳經中央通過開映。在本埠的銀幕上，看他與猛獸角鬭，聽他引吭長嘯的日子，當在不遠吧！</p>
<p>影片談评</p>
<h3 id="c293">評「大偵探聶克」 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Thin　Man丨南京</p>
<p>通常的偵探片，都是以緊張刺戟，使人們急迫的靜待着離奇的殺人案件之水落石出。換句話說，編劇者能够構成一個極盡曲折之能事的故事，而導演人又能將空氣製造得非常嚴肅和恐怖，便是他們盡了最大的責任。但是，如此程度的影片，並不是每一個偵探片都能做到的，相反的却通常是沉悶異常，這對於「娱樂的」觀衆們乃是不大適合味口的。他們所要求的是「心花怒放」「慢慢的自沙發椅上沉下去」，然而結果却是一點也不能興奮的沉沉入睡。連這一點都不能做到，遑論其他？至於我們要求至少在偵深片也要有新的内容，那更是在現階段的美國影片中不易獲得的了。</p>
<p>如上所述的原因，偵探影片不爲一般觀衆所歡迎，的確也是事實。因此聰明的製片者便不得不另尋途徑。雖然他們不能獲得新的内容，但在形式上總得來幾次新的嘗試。這，我們就這范達克（Ｗ·Ｓ　Ｖan　Dyke）的「大偵探聶克」中，可以得着相當的證明。</p>
<p>我們不會忽視，這一偵探片和許多同類的作品一樣，完全没有新的内容的。一個電氣學者失了十萬股票，旋不久，便姑失踪，又有二人相繼慘死，還有一人亦告失踪，他們都和本案有關。其後經過一個已告退休了的偵探之偵察而破案，原來那電影家已被他的法律顧問暗殺而藏屍，其餘二個死者亦爲他所殺，原因是他已分得十萬份票之一半。在這一故事中，我們除了所謂律師的知法犯法而外，還能找出更好的東西麽？没有的，和一般的情殺案或盜殺案一樣，没有什麽可取之處。</p>
<p>不過劇作者和導演者，却將這平凡的内容補救於諧劇的形式之中，因此他們盡力將那偵探寫成一個了不起的人物。他生活浪漫，他凡事滿不在乎，而同時他又非常沉着而機警。就在他的個人生活中，他和他夫人之間，描寫得非常有趣而生動，這對於偵探片所常有的沉悶空氣，破壞不少。正因爲如此，導演極力在他身上描寫，於是他純粹成爲非現實的理想中的人物。最顯着的便是當他和另一偵探在海諾之家，在緊張的空氣中他却吐着烟圈。在宴請諸嫌疑犯的時候，當兇犯出槍射擊的時候，他立刻揮拳擊之仆地。同樣，當他和夫人在寢床調笑的時候，一暴漢突入，企圖行兇，可是他却從容處理，卒徒手將兇漢擊倒。這樣誇張的描寫，更因着威廉鮑衛爾演得「神妙」，於是這一位偵探的奇才使人不敢相信了。</p>
<p>但是這一作品是否就諧趣到底呢？至少我們認爲要請嫌疑犯的一塲，仍然是相當沉悶。一般的說，與其作爲偵探片看，倒不如作爲普通的諧趣看。茂娜格埃又演得很好。</p>

<p>— 馨之</p>
<p>佐麥克利入影界已經有五六年了。他在「蠻女天堂」一片中受了不少的榮譽，以是他至今尙孑然一身，非但没有意中人，連情侶亦從未有過一。</p>
<p>他的地位雖然遠不及約翰吉爾勃，及已故的范倫鐵諾，和現在的克拉克蓋勃爾，雷門諾伐羅那一般人，但是好萊塢女子傾慕於他的却也不在少數，可是他對於好們却一概没有絲毫的留戀。</p>
<p>有一次，在好萊塢一個茶舞會裏夜深的時候，佐麥克利正想從一個冷僻的座位上站起，正要回家睡去，突然有一個女子走到他旁邊坐下，向他招呼，她開了一瓶香賓酒，倒了一杯，自己喝了半杯，請佐麥克利喝那其餘的半杯。他發極了，但是想想，逃已逃不掉了，祗能勉强飲了。那女子却又進一步的要求他「開水」了。佐麥克利進退爲難，又恐怕她惱羞成怒，不得不接受她的要求，一面却暗暗在她耳邊說：「那邊門口不是你丈夫嗎」？那女子不暇細看，立刻逃之夭夭，而佐麥克利却得了一個脫身之計。</p>
<p>佐麥克利拒絶這樣的女子，並不止一次，不知有了多少次數。他在交際塲中，没有一次涉及戀愛問題的，好萊塢的人對於他這樣的性格，都以呆子視之。其實他何嘗呆呢。他在銀幕上表現愛情。不是都入情入理嗎？原來他有他的理由在着。</p>
<p>他至今没有談及娶妻的問題，他說：「妻子没有不娶的理由，現在不娶，將來也要娶的，這不過是時間上的問題而已。但是我卽使欲有一個愛人，亦决不在好萊塢的，我以爲影界的生活太危險了，將來一定要到鄉間去作一田舍郎。我以爲我如果到鄉間去度生活，好萊塢的女子，也肯和我一同到鄉下去嗎」？</p>
<p>所以，佐麥克利的心中，原已有一個理想中妻子在着。</p>

<p>曼麗特蘭漱死了，有人問爲什麽美國的電影雜誌裏，没有什麽盛大的紀載？似乎還没有她的生日宣傳得響哩。營然，悲哀不是言語可以表示的，祗有淚水與愁容，浮在各人的面上。的確，那是美國的一大損失，而是好萊塢切膚之痛。當她病勢日漸沉重的時候，好萊塢和全國的觀衆，都爲她祈禱着，總統羅斯福亦打電報給她，祝她早點勿藥。但是昊天不吊，她竟撒手而去了。曼麗病了共兩年之久。其間她亦曾力病工作過很久。她體質素來很强，大家總以當她可以痊可的，但是因爲責任心太重的緣故，她竟不能作長期的完全休養，以致六十餘歲的老媪，竟此不能支持了。她死後，還有一張片子呌Living　inaBig　Way，没有能够開拍，尤爲可惜。</p>
<p>再則照中國人的迷信，尤其是南方人，壽是不大好做的。去年十一月九日，好萊塢爲這位老太婆大做其壽。總統亦來電慶祝，美國全國各州的州長，都拿各州的土産，作禮物送給她。她所收到的賀電，不下數十萬封。開了伶界空前的先例。照迷信的人說起來，做壽都壞了事了。那末爲什麽該死的做壽，又不死呢？</p>

<p>Fierce Battle in Yutian with Bandits</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Town Suffers a Terrible Calamity</p>
<p>Bandit Forces Show No Sign of Weakening</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The militia from Fengrun, Zunhua, and Yutian counties have gathered in large numbers, joining forces with Sun Jizhou's troops of the War Zone Security Reinforcement General Team to besiege Gaoqiao Town. The bandits are preventing villagers from transporting grain into the town, entrenched within and forcing locals to join their ranks, swelling to over two hundred. On the 28th, they engaged in a fierce two-hour battle with the militia and police. Villagers were driven to the front lines, resulting in over ten innocent deaths. Sixty to seventy women, subjected to abuse, sought death in resentment. The town has been occupied by bandits for four days, showing no sign of retreat. Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang initially planned to send plainclothes troops into the war zone to establish Yutian as a base and incite local security forces to rebel. However, the security forces, understanding righteousness, refused to collaborate with traitors, thwarting Shi's plan. When the plainclothes troops were dispatched, they were ambushed by the security forces, leading to the complete failure of the plan. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chiba and Yin Tong Confer <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>War Zone Reorganization Issues</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng and Others Scheduled to Meet Today</p>
<p>Preparing to Implement the War Zone Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiba planned to take his family to Pan today en route to Changchun. Due to the necessity of discussing matters with Yin Tong, he has temporarily postponed his departure until tomorrow morning. Yin is currently at his residence, engaged in a two-hour discussion with Chiba before they dispersed. Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming will hold a preparatory meeting in Beiping tomorrow before commencing the implementation of the War Zone Reorganization Plan. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Beiping, Yin Tong immediately contacted Yin Rugeng and Chiba to discuss war zone negotiations, agreeing to initiate discussions in Beiping. Tao Shangming was also telegraphed, inviting him to Beiping. The seven principles agreed upon in Dalian, such as the quota for new security forces entering the war zone, the prohibition of carrying firearms, and the crackdown on illegal activities by Japanese ronin, will be addressed after Tao Shangming's arrival in Beiping. The issues of taking over the various passes of the Great Wall and the withdrawal of Japanese troops will be resolved sequentially after the aforementioned matters are settled. Previously, Japanese military officer Chiba submitted a written memorandum to the war zone representatives, imposing considerable restrictions on the number of new security forces allowed to enter, hindering resolution. The reorganization of the East Security Forces will also be implemented separately after discussions in Beiping. The takeover of Dolon Nor is premature and contingent on the resolution of the war zone's situation in the eastern part of Hebei. The Malanyu Eastern Tombs issue will proceed according to the original plan, with only minor procedural details remaining. Chiba and Yin Rugeng will inspect the Malanyu Eastern Tombs together after concluding negotiations here. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng stated that Yin Tong returned to Beiping and had a meeting last night. Regarding the war zone issues, Director Yin will consult with others, including Tao Shangming, in Beiping, based on the principles agreed upon at the Dalian conference, to formulate comprehensive plans. Tao will arrive in Beiping soon. The bandits in Yutian have infiltrated from Tangshan, Fengrun, and Baodi. Local police, militia, and security forces are currently encircling and suppressing them. Due to heavy rain in Sanhe, the river has risen sharply, and the long-distance telephone poles have been washed away, disrupting communication. Detailed reports on the bandit disturbances have not yet been received. (30th Dispatch) (Beiping) The representatives of the Qing imperial family on the Eastern Tombs Preservation Committee have not yet been selected. The 7th Division of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Malanyu, the Mamiya Company, has been ordered to return to Chengde. The 25th Regiment headquarters in Malanyu will be relieved by a company of 120 men from the Yagamijishuntoku Unit of the 26th Regiment. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) Military sources confirm that Luo Binghui's bandit force of over two thousand men raided Nanxi Pingxi, eighty li from Shouning, on the 27th. A small detachment attempted to attack the Xiading Sea Port, but was intercepted by our forces along the original front line, suffering significant losses. The remnants fled towards Shou County. On the 28th, various armies, along with the troops, advanced on multiple routes to encircle and suppress the bandits. Unable to resist, the bandits sought a way out, appearing to flee westward. The provincial authorities have telegraphed the stationed troops to intercept them. The remnants of the Red bandits in northern Fujian are gradually being cleared. The construction of the Jianning to Yanping highway has been completed and is scheduled to open to traffic on the 31st. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Reliable sources indicate that preparations for the attack on Tingzhou in western Fujian are complete along the entire front. The order for the general offensive can be issued next month. It is expected that Changting can be captured soon, allowing a rendezvous with a certain route. Ruijin is expected to be completely captured by October. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Armored Cars and Ironclad Vehicles Deployed</p>
<p>Kawashima Yoshiko Secretly Organizes an Agency to Contact Traitors</p>
<p>Japanese Garrison Troops Along the Beining Railway Conduct Exercises in Yuguan</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9 AM this morning, a company of Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin conducted street warfare exercises on Asahi Street, Akiyama Street, Akashi Street, and Fukushima Street in the Japanese Concession. Temporary sentry posts were set up at the southeastern corner of the city and at intersections on the main street of the southern city leading to the Chinese city, prohibiting passage. Armored cars and tanks were deployed. The exercises concluded at 10:30 AM, and traffic between the Japanese Concession and the Chinese city resumed at 11 AM. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain party is instigating Kawashima Yoshiko to organize a secret agency in Tianjin to contact disgruntled politicians and military personnel, plotting against North China. Kawashima recently returned to Tianjin after seeking instructions from Changchun and is directing Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang in plans to disrupt the war zone and Tianjin. She has also secured the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Peace Preservation and National Salvation Army for Shi and the title of Commander of the East Asia Allied Army for Liu, with the appointments already made. Liu and Shi are currently organizing the puppet East Asia Allied Army and Peace Preservation and National Salvation Army. The appointed puppet division, brigade, regiment, and battalion commanders, numbering about 200, are hiding in a certain foreign concession. The specific implementation methods have not yet been determined. Although the titles for Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang have been formally established by a certain country, they are intended for future use and not to be revealed at this time. However, Kawashima Yoshiko, in her plea at the puppet state, exaggerated her words when entering the pass, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars that cannot be accounted for. Therefore, she is trying her best to get Liu Guitang to first gather bandit troops and stage an event in the war zone or Tianjin to demonstrate that the funds were not wasted. The steps for large-scale actions have not yet been determined. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Responsible authorities in Tianjin stated that although there have been rumors recently, the situation is not entirely serious. Strict security measures have been implemented, ensuring complete safety. However, since Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan have joined forces, and although their previous plans have failed, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not devise other methods to fulfill their desires. Therefore, sooner or later, a riot is likely to occur. The authorities are actively devising countermeasures to prevent problems before they arise. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 28th, the Japanese troops in Yuguan conducted field exercises in the South Sea, firing dozens of mountain guns from 9 AM to 1 PM. The Japanese garrison troops along the Beining Railway conducted exercises in Shanhaiguan, which concluded before noon on the 30th. The troops gradually returned to their original posts that evening. Two hundred British troops stationed in Yuguan also conducted live-fire target practice on the South Sea beach at 8 AM on the 28th, ceasing at 10 AM. On the 29th, the troops boarded a train to Kaiping for a change of guard. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 29th, two British cruisers and one American and one Italian warship arrived off the coast of Dagu, anchoring three nautical miles offshore. They remained there on the 30th. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The intelligence agency organized by Kawashima Yoshiko in Tianjin uses large sums of money to trap staff members of various agencies, attempting to buy genuine information. There are quite a few people who have been bought over and are secretly working for her. All our actions are reported by secret agents. Her method of contact is chain-like, with those engaged in intelligence work being unfamiliar with each other and not knowing Yoshishima, who is in charge. However, when there is information to report, the communication is remarkably efficient. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Starting on the evening of the 29th, various concessions in Tianjin began to strictly check passing pedestrians, with the French Concession Police Bureau implementing the strictest measures. (30th Dispatch)</p>

The establishment of sub-checkpoints at Xifengkou and Jieling is still actively underway. The checkpoints are far apart, and transportation is obstructed, with travelers relying entirely on mule carts, requiring time for preparation. Smuggling problems will be addressed after the five sub-checkpoints are fully established. The unified tax inspection at Koubei Jieling and Yiyuan is temporarily executed by the Tianjin Customs sub-checkpoint until the establishment of the unified tax bureau inspection sub-office.

<p>(Beiping) Before leaving Beiping, Gu Mengyu had generally formulated improvement plans for various railways. The directors of various railways who are currently awaiting instructions in Beiping include Yin Tong of the Beining Railway, Chen Yanjiong of the Pinghan Railway, Shen Chang of the Pingsui Railway, Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway, Li Xiangen of the Yuehan Railway, and Qiu Wei, chairman of the Jinpu Railway. Gu is scheduled to call a meeting with the directors of various railways tomorrow morning. The directors of various railways have important proposals or submissions. During the meeting, Gu will instruct them to implement the various railway business improvement plans accordingly. Gu is scheduled to return south on the 4th due to urgent telegrams from the capital. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Yanjiong stated that the Pinghan Railway is actively reorganizing and striving to reduce expenses, saving approximately 300,000 yuan per month. This money will be accumulated for the railway's construction projects. In seven years, 28 million yuan can be obtained, part of which will be used to repay outstanding debts and part of which will be invested in construction. Within seven years, the entire railway can be restored to its former state. (13th Dispatch)</p>

Our forces have intercepted them, preventing their success, and they have fled back to the Yangming Mountains, still planning to flee westward or return to their old lair. Therefore, the counties are instructed to quickly and closely organize self-defense, intelligence, communication, and transportation matters at the local district, township, and town levels to assist the national army in its suppression efforts. Intelligence and communication are particularly important, and local militias and civilians should be selected to be distributed as scouts, conducting day and night reconnaissance and reporting bandit activities at any time. Those who accurately detect bandit activities should be rewarded. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Sources from the Ministry of Industry report that tung oil is a specialty product of China, essential for the furniture industry and for corrosion protection of automobile bodies. The amount exported to Japan each year is quite large. Last year, statistics show that 988 dan were exported to Japan, valued at 23,558 yuan. The Governor-General of Korea has been encouraging the planting of tung trees for years. Takahashi Mototaro, the branch manager of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha in Seoul, previously collected tung oil seeds and transplanted them in Jeonnam Jeju in Korea, where they have grown successfully. In the future, they may be exported to Europe and the United States, monopolizing the world tung oil market. The Japanese silk industry has already seized our European and American markets, and it is feared that our tung oil market will also be taken over. Compatriots, please pay attention.

To the north of Khabarovsk is the Amur Railway, and there are two branch lines leading to military supply factories and ammunition depots in the city. Outside the city, there is a complete airfield and automobile factory. On the banks of the Amur River, there are naval air squadrons and naval factories. The air, sea, and land forces in Khabarovsk total approximately 500,000 men. Recently, a large number of troops have been transported from southern Soviet Russia. Most of the troops in Khabarovsk are from southern Russia. Siberian Russians are not adequately trained and are mostly transported to southern Russia. The commander of the Far East Red Army especially emphasizes concentrating elite Russian troops in the Khabarovsk area. The construction of the new railway between Khabarovsk and Nikolaevsk is now 50% complete. The military roads near Khabarovsk extend in all directions. There are countless artillery positions nearby, and they are covered with barbed wire. Its military facilities emphasize both offense and defense.

<p>Against the Soviet Consulate in Suifenhe</p>
<p>(Moscow) Judging from news coming from Harbin and other places in Manchuria, the Japanese and Manchukuo sides, with aggressive intentions, are focusing their provocative anti-Soviet actions on the Soviet consulate in Suifenhe with a more insistent attitude. They are adding absurd and slanderous accusations against the consulate and Consul Strumpe-Meikhe in particular, clearly intending to use this as an excuse for their provocative actions. The Russian-language "Harbin Times" and "Gazette" openly claim that "several Soviet consulates stationed in Manchuria are participating in" sabotage work, and repeatedly refer to "the mission fulfilled by this Soviet consulate in Suifenhe (headed by Consul Strumpe-Meikhe) as the greatest" in an insulting manner. Judging from this propaganda, the search of the Suifenhe Railway Club by the police on August 27 is most noteworthy. Although this search yielded no results, the club was ultimately closed. Those familiar with current affairs in Harbin now believe that the concentration of unswervingly insistent and provocative actions by Japanese and Manchukuo ultra-aggressives on the Soviet consulate in Suifenhe is a preparatory step for direct action against the consulate, with the aim of causing a new and serious conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. (TASS Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) News continues to arrive from Harbin that Soviet railway employees arrested along the Chinese Eastern Railway are being secretly subjected to severe beatings and torture, forcing them to "confess" to having orchestrated the destruction of vehicles and stations, etc. The Harbin Daily News vaguely mentions documents fabricated by Harbin police and gendarmes with inventive genius, and accepts them without question. The newspaper claims that during the search, several documents were found on the Soviet personnel, as well as receipts for funds obtained for destroying vehicles on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The newspaper even claims, "At the time of the search, a document was discovered proving how much reward was received for each vehicle destroyed, with special rewards for destroying special trains," etc. The newspaper also claims that this document was co-signed by "Soviet administrative personnel" and "bandits." This type of reporting in Japanese newspapers is sufficient to show how crude and absurd the fabrications are of those who organize and carry out anti-Soviet propaganda, and that the Harbin Daily News' assessment of the level of knowledge of its readers is certainly not very high.

<p>(London) The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, commented on the issue of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations, stating that there is unlikely to be any problem regarding allowing the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations at the General Assembly next month, because only a two-thirds majority is required to pass it. As for giving the Soviet Union a permanent seat on the Administrative Council, this requires the unanimous consent of the entire Administrative Council. Therefore, if there are differences of opinion in the League of Nations General Assembly, the result will inevitably cause disputes in the Administrative Council.

At the same time, they launched flares to the ground in place of bombs, but were soon driven back by defensive aircraft. (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Le Bourget, France - During the air force exercises this morning, the bomber squadron attacking Paris, as expected in advance, and taking advantage of the dense clouds, broke through the sky defense line twice and flew to Le Bourget airfield. According to expert research, in this situation, Le Bourget airfield would be destroyed. Afterwards, the attacking aircraft targeted the city of Nancy and launched an attack, but the defensive aircraft squadron received a radio report and was able to quickly assemble, delaying the progress of the attacking aircraft. Also, during this morning's exercise, Chief of Staff General Weygand and Minister of Aviation General Tran were present to inspect. (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Travels Thousands of Miles to Visit Father's Grave</p>
<p>London - Chen Shangying (transliteration), a student at a Chinese military academy, left his homeland in 1929 at the age of 19 to visit his father's grave in Peru. Because he had little money, he often traveled on foot, passing through Japan, North America, and South America, and arrived at his father's grave in 1931. At that time, Chen suddenly had the ambition to travel the world, so he continued to trek and arrived in England. It is estimated that he has worn out 50 pairs of shoes, walked 15,000 miles, and has passed through the battle lines of Bolivia and Paraguay, enduring all kinds of hardships. Mr. Chen hopes to return to his hometown of Guangzhou within three years. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Japan Reforming Manchukuo Organs</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions on Expanding into the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of reforming the resident organs in Manchukuo is the first political test encountered after the formation of the Okada Cabinet. The government authorities had been optimistic, but unexpectedly, the undercurrents of the issue are extremely deep, and the government is also in a state of anxiety. The authorities originally intended to resolve the issue through negotiations by the Ministry of Land, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and hoped that the vice ministers of the three ministries would engage in preliminary negotiations. However, the reform proposals submitted by the three ministries still have fundamentally opposite points in their command systems, and it is extremely difficult for them to approach each other. In particular, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, which has maintained a relatively observant attitude, is advocating its separation of powers doctrine and has a very tough attitude. Therefore, the resolution of the issue is being delayed. After several more negotiations, the government can propose a compromise plan at an appropriate time. However, given the hardening of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the different understandings of the Army and Foreign Ministries, it is feared that this compromise plan will be difficult to resolve. In the end, Prime Minister Okada will exercise political negotiations with the Ministers of the Army and Foreign Affairs, and then the Prime Minister will adjudicate in order to resolve the entire case. How the Prime Minister adjudicates will greatly affect the future political situation, and all parties are paying close attention to the future of the case. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of reforming the resident organs in Manchukuo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' proposal is the most appropriate, and is trying to negotiate with the Army authorities. If the Army side cannot agree to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' fundamental proposition of stationing an ambassador in Manchukuo in accordance with the ambassadorial authority stipulated in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' official system, then there is no other way but to maintain the status quo.

<h3 id="e52">Crackdown on Rising Rice Prices - Respect <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Grain Price Committee, in view of repeated increases in rice prices and concerns about the people's food supply, believes that if restrictions are not imposed, it could trigger a food panic, harming the livelihood of the common people and social stability. Therefore, it has resolved that the maximum rice price should not exceed thirteen yuan and fifty cents, and has requested the Social Affairs Bureau to approve the crackdown on rice merchants in order to lower rice prices and protect the people's food supply. This year's drought is extremely severe, and the disaster area is very large. The rice-producing provinces along the Yangtze River are almost all affected. Although it is not yet the harvest season, it is impossible to predict the exact figures for the losses. However, the seedlings have already withered, and the fields have cracked. Judging from the overall situation, not only will areas with difficult irrigation have no harvest, but the harvest in areas with crisscrossing ditches will likely be reduced by more than half. This is truly a great calamity for the people.</p>
<p>Considering the accumulation of agricultural operations in our country, those habitually called "rice weevils" specialize in buying up as much as possible when new grain comes on the market, and then selling it when the old grain runs out the following year. In one fell swoop, they sit back and enjoy huge profits. If this year's autumn harvest is hopeless, the rice price will naturally be higher than usual, and the hoarders will want to get an even higher price, holding back and not selling. In addition, the recent drought and shallow water have made river transportation very inconvenient, and the transport of rice boats has been further reduced. At this time, how can urban grain merchants not take the opportunity to manipulate market prices and seek huge profits? Logically speaking, our country has had several years of bumper harvests in the past. Even if there is a drought this year and the harvest is reduced, it should not be difficult to use the stored grain to provide relief and overcome this difficulty. Unfortunately, in recent years, our country's rural economy has been constantly eroded by chronic panic. Most farm families below the middle class have very little grain stored from the previous year, let alone the poor. Therefore, in times of bumper harvest, they can only barely survive and have no surplus. With little savings and a sudden major disaster, there is no way to make up for the deficit. The establishment of ever-normal granaries was originally an important policy to prevent agricultural famine, but due to poor management, it is equivalent to a formality and has completely lost its due function.</p>
<p>In general, urban industries and businesses are gradually developing, but transportation between inland grain-producing areas and cities still uses old tools, which are time-consuming and expensive. As a result, coastal cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin rely heavily on imports of food from overseas, while domestic agricultural products have become secondary. In the past, during bumper harvests, foreign grain poured in, and the amount was considerable. The fear of cheap grain was intensified. As for today, when agricultural production is poor, farmers have no choice but to buy grain at high prices to maintain their minimum living standards. Although years of plenty and scarcity alternate, the poverty of farmers is becoming more and more serious. As for the cities bearing the consequences of rural decline, the livelihoods of the common people have already been exhausted. If the rising rice prices are not restricted, they will only perish together with the farmers.</p>
<p>Restricting rice prices has become the unanimous call of those who care about the people's suffering today. The means lies in cracking down on the manipulation of rice merchants and the hoarding of grain. If this measure can be effective, it can at least have a passive effect and provide temporary protection for small citizens. We are not unaware that stabilizing the people's food supply requires a comprehensive plan, and then we can use this plan to expand from the local to the whole. For example, there are already many people advocating for the control of food across the country. However, this matter is of great importance and will not succeed without national planning and central coordination. Our country's national economy has always lacked organization. There is little accurate investigation into the production, sales, tax regulations, transportation, and planting of food across the country, let alone other things. There is no other choice but to retreat to the second best option, strictly setting restrictions on the highest rice price to alleviate the immediate crisis. At the same time, responsible authorities in various provinces and cities should raise funds from banks to purchase and store rice in preparation for the needs after the autumn harvest. In this way, even under a passive sense, seeking market balance is better than empty and broad relief measures. In the midst of rising rice prices, we sincerely hope that the municipal authorities can be practical and realistic, restrict rice prices, and purchase and store grain in advance to benefit the common people.</p>

<p>Not Wanting to Use Gold Profits to Depreciate the Dollar</p>
<p>The President's Remarks Indicate That Implementation Is Still Pending</p>
<p>Hyde Park - President Roosevelt issued a statement to the press, referring to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech yesterday, saying that the government's ultimate intention is to find a way to use the surplus earned from gold. A reporter asked whether this surplus would be used for inflation again. Roosevelt laughed and did not answer. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park - Regarding Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech, the President believes that the $2.8 billion profit from the devaluation of the dollar will ultimately be used to reduce the national debt.

<p>Hyde Park - President Roosevelt today denied rumors of immediate inflation, saying that the government absolutely does not want to use gold profits to reduce the value of the dollar. Currency experts predict that the government's plan to use gold profits to reduce the national debt is a kind of inflation, as the government will turn this surplus into paper money and issue it to pay off the national debt. Therefore, the President made this statement to deny it. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(New York) - Since Wall Street received unconfirmed reports that the gold to silver ratio may be set at 16 to 1, and that the pound will depreciate again, it has become increasingly convinced that the government will implement an inflationary policy. The source of these rumors cannot be traced, but many in the financial community believe they are true. According to experts, after the gold to silver ratio becomes 16 to 1, the price of silver will rise to $2.18 per ounce. Wall Street believes that if the government continues to purchase silver bullion in foreign markets, cash will continue to flow out. In fact, a considerable amount of cash has flowed to Paris, so the franc exchange rate is very strong. A well-known financial expert in Washington said that Britain may raise the price of gold to over 150 shillings per ounce. If so, the United States must reduce the value of the dollar, because the benefits of foreign trade after the pound's devaluation have now been offset by the devaluation of other countries, so it must be reduced again. Wall Street had a very good impression of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech yesterday, but those who advocate inflationary policies expressed dissatisfaction with his statement that the $2.8 billion profit from the devaluation of the dollar would be kept in the treasury.

<p>(New York) - The Wall Street Journal reported that New York exchange industry insiders believe that the US government is very likely to directly support the idea of controlling the exchange market.

<p>(London) - The price of gold in London rose sharply today, with about £345,000 worth of gold changing hands at a price of 140 shillings and 3 pence. This price is based on the principle of supply and demand. The franc is quoted at 75.25 plus 7 pence, and the dollar is quoted at 5 dollars and 3 cents 625 plus 2 shillings and 2.5 pence. On February 2nd of this year, gold was priced at 140 shillings, but today's price broke the previous record. There is a risk that the dollar will continue to depreciate. If the dollar depreciates, the pound will inevitably follow the same trend. In addition, there is no certainty whether France can maintain the gold standard. This is the main reason for the upward trend in gold prices. The dollar has encountered demand at this time, which has a weakening effect on the pound, and Britain's exchange controls have failed to curb this effect. It is widely believed that Britain's Exchange Equalization Account has been reduced. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Order Restricting Ceramics Is Revoked Batavia - The talks between the two countries' representatives, from 10:00 AM to 1:10 PM, presented their respective claims on various issues. Due to maritime issues, the Dutch East Indies refused to budge, so other issues could not form a committee. The two countries' representatives asked their respective governments for instructions on maritime issues and then dispersed. Before the two governments' instructions arrive, the negotiations will be temporarily suspended. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Batavia - The reason why the Dutch have adopted a very tough attitude on the maritime issues hindering the progress of Dutch-Japanese negotiations is that two shipping companies, Java-China-Japan Line and another company, are very exhausted and have reached a critical juncture. They want to protect these two shipping companies. However, the Dutch's ostensible reason is that private negotiations between the Netherlands and Japan cannot resolve maritime issues, so they have been moved to the agenda for negotiations between government representatives of the two countries. However, the problem that exists now is how to agree on a method of negotiation. During the meeting between the two countries' representatives yesterday, it was heard that Representative Nagaoka asked how about changing the venue to Tokyo or Kobe. Representative Lanleford replied that it must be in Batavia, as the Dutch East Indies always hope that negotiations will be conducted between governments in Batavia. (Domei News Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Camel Owners from Sui Province Flee Xinjiang</p>
<p>Guihua: Recently, dozens of camel owners have fled back from Xinjiang in a desperate state. According to them, since Jin Shuren took office, soldiers and bandits have been rampant throughout Xinjiang. Over the past few years, it is estimated that over 5,000 camels going from Sui were either seized for forced labor or robbed by bandits, resulting in complete losses. At present, prices for all goods are high, and starvation is everywhere. Placed in difficult and precarious circumstances,</p>
<p>we seized an opportunity in May to escape Xinjiang. Some of us pooled money to buy a skinny camel to take turns riding, while others begged along the way and walked. Only recently did we safely arrive in Sui. When we left, we were all camel owners with hundreds of camels, but now we are completely destitute. It is truly tragic. As for the obstacles from Outer Mongolia, the camel industry in Sui relies solely on the Xinjiang route. Now that it is in such a state, we earnestly hope that the authorities will pay attention and find ways to provide relief. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Xining: Due to the bankruptcy of rural villages and the destitution of the people in this province, only 8,100 yuan in aircraft donation funds were raised in this province. Furthermore, the realization of banknotes in silver dollars has been quite difficult. It has recently been learned that the association has specially entrusted the provincial chamber of commerce to be responsible for introducing reliable firms. The funds were remitted to the Tianjin Central Bank in two installments as deposit for the Qinghai Province aircraft donation funds. The current amount of silver dollars is 6,300, with an exchange fee of 300 yuan per thousand yuan, totaling 8,190 yuan. The funds have been transferred to the Shanghai Central Bank to be directly remitted to the National Aviation Construction Association and a receipt has been obtained from the Shanghai Central Bank.

<p>Xining: In Xining County's Xiaonanchuan, Shangxiatang, and Longtai areas, dark clouds gathered at 4 p.m. on the 16th, and a large hailstorm fell, with hailstones as large as eggs.

<p>Xiaofeng County, Zhejiang Province, Appeals for Relief: Respectfully addressed to Shen Bao, natural disasters are rampant, and drought demons are wreaking havoc. From summer to autumn, it has not rained for months. Xiaofeng, a mountainous county, has rice paddies located between ridges and mountain gullies. It is estimated that out of the tens of thousands of mu in the entire county, only a small percentage of paddy fields along the streams have timely irrigation and can be expected to have an autumn harvest. The majority of the nourishment for the main grains and miscellaneous cereals has always relied on rainwater as the source. Now, the soil is cracked, and all seedlings have withered. The farmers' stored grain has been exhausted, and no new grain is harvested. We have heard daily reports of people holding rice stalks and weeping, with entire families awaiting death. In the northern districts, the villages of Minle, Jingfeng, Zhangwu, Xishan, Yong'an, Dashou, Shangshu, Donglan, Meijia, Shangwu, Jintai, and Guihua are particularly severely affected, with extremely impoverished conditions. Tens of thousands of poor people have no rice grains, cooking fires are extinguished, and well-fields are deserted. Cries and lamentations echo everywhere, and the tragic situation is beyond words. The extent of the disaster area this year is rare in a century. Although the government is anxious above and the gentry and people are running about below, the treasury is empty and grain stores are lacking. Relief and price stabilization efforts cannot find a solution. Driven by hunger, a crisis is imminent. Apart from sending telegrams to appeal for relief, we are compelled to send this urgent telegram, earnestly requesting your esteemed newspaper to be concerned about the plight of the deeply affected people, to advocate and appeal on their behalf. If assistance with grain and congee is generously granted, the kindness will be as great as providing flesh and bones and the grace of rebirth, bestowed by your esteemed newspaper. With great urgency, we remain, the Agricultural Association, Education Association, and Women's Association of Xiaofeng County, Zhejiang Province, bowing in respect.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Austrian Coup and the European Situation (German Correspondence) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Impact of Dollfuss' Assassination</p>
<p>Germany's Attempt to Merge is Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>Austria is a massive political and economic cancer in Europe. Given the current situation, there is absolutely no way to cure it. Because the pre-war Austria was the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although it treated Germany as an elder brother, it still possessed a population of over 51 million and an area of 677,000 square kilometers. It was still a major power in Central Europe. Although its industry was relatively backward, it could still maintain its independence among the great powers. After the Treaty of Saint-Germain was established, its population was only over 6 million, and its land area was reduced to 82,400 square kilometers. Vienna alone accounts for 30% of the total population. There is absolutely no way for it to be self-sufficient in production. Especially since the world economic panic hit Europe, Austria's national economy has been drifting in the wind and rain, relying entirely on borrowing to survive. The League of Nations guaranteed a loan of 650 million gold kronen in 1921. When the Credit Anstalt Bank collapsed in 1929, it fell into another economic tragedy, and it will not be easy to find a solution in the future, or even no solution at all. Politically, merging with Germany is impossible due to the opposition of the people in the country and the opposition of the countries in the Versailles system and Italy. If it completely follows Italy's request and advances aggressively on the path of independence, it will also encounter the hidden reefs of the National Socialist Party's potential power, making it extremely difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>The political party that Dollfuss relied on was the Christian Social Party, the most right-wing party in Austria. Although Dollfuss, in his capacity as Prime Minister, also served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Public Security, Agriculture and Forestry, and National Defense, showing a very condescending and dictatorial demeanor, four of the remaining seven cabinet members were members of the Heimwehr, and their opinions were not entirely consistent with Dollfuss'. There are two facts to prove this. The first is that Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg (leader of the Heimwehr) said, after Mussolini and Hitler met in June of this year, when Austria strongly advocated against terrorism, "It is not enough to delegate terrorist methods solely to state executives." Dollfuss, in a speech in the suburbs of Vienna, also said, "......When the country is in a time of trouble, all groups should unite and pull those who engage in terrorist acts into their own camp. When this opportunity is urgent, there must be no middle ground. Those who are not our comrades are our enemies." The opposition between the two was already very obvious. The second is that until the very last moment, on July 25th, Dollfuss was besieged by National Socialists in a room and was about to be killed, while the Minister of Security and the National Security Supervisor, Fesciak, who was also detained, was spared. This shows that Dollfuss himself did not have a firm grasp of power, and it also proves that the Heimwehr's steps were not in line with his.</p>
<p>The source of the Heimwehr was that after the European War, Austria was defeated, and Italian and Yugoslav troops entered Austrian territory. These troops mostly lacked control, and their actions as victorious countries led to acts of invasion and plunder everywhere. The Austrian people were eager to resist and used actual force to stop these atrocities. Therefore, rural youths and soldiers out of service automatically organized themselves in various places. Later, it developed from local to national, so it also has another name called "Vanguard Corps." This uprising, after Dollfuss was killed, Austria almost fell into an irrecoverable state of chaos. It was Starhemberg, the leader of the "Heimwehr," who led the group to suppress the National Socialist youth groups and tried to restore general order.</p>
<p>After Dollfuss was killed, it caused even more unrest throughout Europe. If Germany really had the intention to challenge, then it would have seized the opportunity to merge with Austria, which would have been virtually impossible. Because among the members of the "Heimwehr," there are quite a few who fully sympathize with the National Socialist Party and support the merger of Austria and Germany. However, Italy directly supports Austria's independence. If Hitler were to act rashly, he would inevitably clash with Italy first. At the same time, France, Czechoslovakia, and other related European countries clearly advocated Austria's independence. If Germany were to rise up to challenge, it would have no support, no powerful ally. Therefore, after the problem occurred, Germany did not dare to reach out again and had to let it change naturally. However, Austria is a new powder keg of European turmoil, with the potential to cause a major disaster at any time. The current calm is the effect of an artificial tranquilizer, a temporary respite.

<h3 id="e114">This Year's September 18th Incident <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Japan Sends Fleet and Air Force to "Manchukuo" for Demonstration</p>
<p>General Suetsugu Commands Two Fleets</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Wada Commands Air Force</p>
<p>First Arriving at Dalian, Then Proceeding to Changchun and Harbin</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Japanese Admiral Suetsugu Nobumasa, commanding the First and Second Combined Fleets, accompanied by Rear Admiral Wada, commander of the First Air Battle Squadron, with the aircraft carriers Akagi and Ryūjō, all aircraft, and the aircraft on the battleships, totaling 80 new-style aircraft, have been ordered to enter the port of Dalian on September 18th, and then all the aircraft will fly to Changchun to participate in the flight. It is known that Japan's dispatch of the Combined Fleet and a large part of the air force to the Northeast, judging from the scheduled date of entry into the port, is intended to flaunt its power, intimidate our compatriots in the Northeast, and, due to the interruption of negotiations on the East China Railway, with the situation in the Far East becoming tense, to show a threat to the Soviet Union. It is deeply regrettable that the Japanese have taken this action as the anniversary of the national crisis approaches. The actions of the fleet after arriving in Dalian and its planned activities are recorded as follows: 1. On the 17th, the Japanese fleet passed through the Pu-Changshan Islands, and at noon on the 18th, it entered Dalian. From the 19th to the 23rd, it will be anchored in the port of Dalian. On the 17th, 40 seaplanes will visit Andong in formation. On the 21st and 24th, flights will be made between Dalian and Harbin. Also, from the 20th to the 24th, 40 aircraft on the ships will visit "Manchukuo" in formation. 2. When the Japanese fleet is anchored in Dalian, officials and civilians will be allowed to visit. The fleet will allow 800 soldiers and above to inspect "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>3. On the 24th, the Second Fleet will leave Dalian. On the 25th, the First Fleet will leave Dalian for Lushun. At this time, student groups from "Manchukuo" and the Kwantung Leased Territory will be allowed to board the ship to observe the fleet's operations. 4. Both fleets will be anchored in Lushun on the 26th, and will leave Lushun for Qingdao on the 27th. While in Lushun, banquets will be held on the Kongō battleship on the 25th and 27th to entertain officials and civilians from "Manchukuo" and the Kwantung Leased Territory. Furthermore, Commander Suetsugu, Commander Takahashi of the Second Fleet, Commander Wada of the Air Battle Squadron, and about 30 others are scheduled to meet with officials and civilians in Dalian on September 18th, visit Changchun on the 19th, pay respects to the puppet on the 20th, give superficial performances, and interact with officials and civilians in Changchun, Harbin, and "Fengtian." They will return to Dalian on the 24th. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>丨Various Circles Eagerly Hope for Troops to Suppress Them丨</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: On the 22nd of this month, bandits who had fled from the Zhejiang border to the Huangjian area of Huizhou Prefecture were defeated by local militia and retreated to the Zhejiang border. They then entered Maohuang via Qingshan Niuling and re-entered Xitou in eastern Wuyuan on the 26th, engaging in widespread disturbances. Afterwards, they fled to Jiangkengkou and Yangtian in northern Wuyuan, where they established a stronghold with about 400 bandits. More than half of the branches were looted, and upon arrival, they engaged in large-scale plunder. Upon hearing the alarm, villagers, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled in droves, leaving behind empty homes. More than ten people were kidnapped, and it is reported that many have suffered. Neighboring villages have also been disturbed. The entire county is in a state of panic. Moreover, the county has suffered a drought this summer, the worst in a century, and now it is suffering from this unprecedented massive robbery, which is truly tragic. People from all walks of life eagerly hope that the local authorities will immediately dispatch troops to suppress the bandits and save the survivors.</p>

<p>Three Routes Encircle Bandit Areas</p>
<p>It Will Not Be Difficult to Eliminate the Remaining Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the remnants of bandits along the Min River were eliminated and the bandits fleeing eastern Fujian collapsed, the anti-bandit military operations at the front have become more active. Commander-in-chief of the northern route, Gu Zhutong, has led his troops to attack Shicheng fiercely. Fierce battles have been fought for days. The Donglu Army Division of northern Fujian has also advanced towards Ninghua from Baishui in Jianning. In the Battle of Guanqiao, 1,400 to 1,500 bandits were killed. The bandits fled south, and the watchtowers along the mountains were burned down. The 1st, 5th, and 9th Army Corps of bandits in the Daxiaotao area at the junction of Liancheng, Ningyang, and Yong'an were also defeated by the Minxi Division on the 22nd, with over a thousand bandits killed. The front line of the current column is only forty miles away from Changting. The two columns of the Nanlu Army have also been reorganized and advanced into western Fujian and eastern Jiangxi. A large-scale operation on three routes has been consolidated, and it will not be difficult to eliminate the remaining bandit areas in southern Jiangxi in a unified manner. (28th)</p>

<p>Occupies Lion Fortress</p>
<p>The Stubborn Resistance of the Remnant Bandits Ended in a Miserable Defeat and Fled Huichang</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Yu Hanmou, commander of the First Column of the Southern Route Army, reported in a telegram on the 24th that he had sent troops to besiege Lion Fortress on the morning of the 22nd. The fortress has solid fortifications and is a key location in Xinfeng and Huichang. The bandits resisted stubbornly. After a fierce battle lasting three hours from dawn to noon, they were finally repelled, and the remnant bandits fled to Huichang, he said. Furthermore, the Garrison Headquarters, based on the confession of Xiong Chinong, a pseudo-staff member who surrendered, as submitted by Yu Hanmou, is quite detailed regarding the current situation in the bandit areas. The confession is excerpted as follows: The most painful thing for the people in the bandit areas at present is that there is no salt to buy, so they have to eat bland food or boil saltpeter to eat. The second is that there is no cloth to buy, and their clothes are torn and cannot cover their bodies. There is no medicine to buy when they are sick, and many die. At the same time, the bandit army forcibly conscripts strong men to serve as bandits and forces each person to pay three sheng of food to supply the bandit army with grain and forcibly purchase public bonds, forcibly recruit transport teams, etc. All of this causes the people in the bandit areas to groan in pain. Any slight resistance will be met with annihilation. Taking Gaopai Village as an example, in just thirteen or fourteen days, about a hundred civilians were slaughtered. All the people under the threat of the bandit army hope that the National Army will go to suppress the bandits so that they can have the opportunity to escape the bandit areas. (The rest omitted)</p>

<p>Battle of Yitadun Was Very Intense</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This spring, the fierce bandit Liu Guitang disturbed Shandong, repeatedly entering and leaving the Shandong border. The counties in southern Shandong were devastated by him. Although he was eventually completely exterminated, many stragglers and remnants of his troops still lurked among the people. Recently, with the rise of the green gauze curtains, they were thinking of making trouble again. Guo Hongru, Chief of Staff of the 66th Brigade of the 22nd Division stationed in Linyi, was ordered to lead troops to suppress them. On the 22nd, they first arrived at Hancun. The bandits under Xu Shangqian fled upon hearing the news. Afterwards, they encountered the bandit Yang Tingyi at Yitadun (Linyi), with about forty or fifty bandits. After fighting for two hours, except for Yang and twenty of the bandits fleeing southeast, the remaining twenty or so were unable to break through and stubbornly resisted in the three-story fort in the village. On the evening of the 24th, during heavy rain, the bandits fled out, trying to escape through the river, but were shot by ambushing machine guns, and the remnant bandits were almost completely killed. During the fierce battle, the officers and soldiers fought bravely, and some were injured. Company officer Zeng Guangrui and soldiers were injured but did not retreat, eventually annihilating the remnant bandits. Guo Hongru led his troops back to Jianyi on the 25th and reported the battle situation to Commander-in-Chief Han Fuju by telegram. Han immediately replied with praise and made arrangements to properly comfort the casualties. Wounded officers were rewarded with fifty yuan in silver, and those who did not retreat were promoted and recorded. Each wounded soldier was rewarded with twenty yuan in silver and was also promoted and recorded. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e119">Incident of a Train Derailing in Shenyang <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Location Was Near Huangguantun</p>
<p>Passengers Were Extremely Panicked After the Accident</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: According to transportation circles, the second passenger train from Beiping to Shenyang derailed on the morning of the 24th. The train had a total of ten cars. At eleven o'clock, it was near the Sima Sanjiazi area west of Huangguantun Station when the roadbed's stone ballast was washed away by rainwater, causing the roadbed to collapse. As the train passed this area, the locomotive and the front six passenger cars derailed, almost overturning. The axle of the tenth third-class passenger car was broken, and the locomotive was also damaged. Several passengers were sitting in the first-class dining car, and it was lunchtime, so the cups and plates all fell to the ground. The Japanese train guards dispatched by the South Manchuria Railway injured their wrists. After the train accident, a locomotive and crane were urgently dispatched from Huangguantun Station to lift the cars out. The damaged tracks were repaired by workers dispatched by the railway bureau. Two third-class cars of the train could not run and were sent back to Shenyang for repairs. The original train continued west at 1:00 p.m. on the 24th and arrived at Shanhaiguan, delayed by two hours. It made up half an hour on the section inside the pass and should have arrived at Qianmen East Station at 9:18 a.m. on the 25th but only arrived at 10:48 a.m. According to passengers on the train, the situation was very panicked when the train suddenly derailed. Some people said that bandits had dug up the railroad tracks. After the train stopped, many passengers took refuge under the train. After the conductor explained that the train had derailed, the truth became clear and they came out to see what happened. This terrifying comedy came to an end. Japanese troops stationed at Huangguantun Station arrived at the accident site by electric railcar and set up guard posts. Because the green gauze curtains have recently risen and bandits are actively operating along the mountain roads, the situation in various places is extremely unstable. (26th)</p>

<p>Since summer, this county has experienced autumn-like weather with extreme drought. The river water has dried up, and the rural farmlands rely on the rising tides day and night. People exert all their strength to bail water, becoming exhausted and falling ill, which is often heard of. Even the farm cattle cannot withstand the labor and are not given time to rest. However, once exposed to the scorching sun, the fields become parched. Farmers eagerly await rain, especially as the rice is setting ears and urgently needs rain to regulate. Otherwise, a crop failure is feared. Fortunately, from yesterday, the scorching sun gradually subsided, and the weather became slightly cooler. Until 5:30 PM today, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and a heavy rain finally fell for about fifteen minutes before stopping. If it can continue to rain, this year's harvest can still be unaffected.</p>

<p>The suicide of Ms. Ye, wife of Zhang Xiaohe of Lu Wu Tu, east of Huayang Bridge, on the 22nd has already been reported in this newspaper. Recently, the case of Ms. Ye's suicide has gradually aroused suspicion among the local people. They all say that the deceased's right hand was chopped off and lay on the ground in front of the bed. There were also about four or five knife wounds on her chest, abdomen, and neck. A suicide victim would never have such courage. If she really wanted to commit suicide, there would be no reason to cut her wrist to the point of severing it. Rumors are rife, but the deceased only had an elderly mother. After the discovery, she was persuaded by the deceased's parents-in-law with sweet words and promises of a grand funeral, so she silently acquiesced. However, the Zhang family fears that the uproar will spread, and they have been bribing influential figures in the area. It is now known that the deceased's uncle, Mr. Ye, does not want the deceased to suffer injustice in silence and will hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit to investigate thoroughly.</p>

He accepted bribes and committed malpractice, only delivering four taels of opium to the county. After the county government investigated and confirmed the facts, on the morning of the 30th, Wu Zexing, Wang Lushi, and four other drug traffickers, including Liu Shengda and Liu Agui, who were caught outside the West Gate, were escorted to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters to be severely punished by military law.</p>

<p>The Weather Turns Cool, with Continuing Rain</p>
<p>The drought in the county has become more serious. Fortunately, rain fell on the 26th, greatly comforting the people. Since this rainfall, the weather has turned cool and refreshing, with the Fahrenheit thermometer reaching around 85 degrees. On the 27th and 28th, there was more light rain. Yesterday morning (the 30th), the sky was overcast with fog, and there was another four or five minutes of rain, with more rain expected. The rice fields are benefiting greatly.</p>
<p>Fire During the Day Claims Two Lives</p>
<p>In the home of Cheng Yiyun, the head of Dongting Town in the Second District, there lived a widowed Ms. Shao Yuan, who was over forty years old and suffered from severe hearing loss. She had two daughters, one of whom was already married, and two sons. The eldest son, A'da, was a guest in another town and did not return home often. The younger son, A'er, was twenty-two years old and worked in a nearby cloth factory. Recently, he had been ill and recuperating at home. At around nine o'clock yesterday morning, A'er was still lying sick in bed, with a kerosene lamp placed on the table to boil medicine. Unexpectedly, it suddenly overturned, causing a fire. A'er woke up in a daze, but the fire was already raging and he could not escape, leading to his death in the flames. At that time, Ms. Shao Yuan had gone to the street to shop. Upon hearing the alarm, she rushed back to try to save A'er, but the fire was too fierce. Not only could she not save A'er, but her entire body was severely burned. She immediately jumped into the river, but the pain only intensified. She was later pulled out by others, but due to her severe injuries, she was in critical condition and unlikely to survive.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps Reorganized into Security Team</p>
<p>The Wuxi District Special Commissioner's Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department recently received a letter from the First Section of the Provincial Security Department stating that the merchant corps in various counties, whether they employed security guards or were volunteer security guards, should be abolished and reorganized into security teams. The reorganization method should be studied by the security team and the respective county magistrates. After receiving the order, Commissioner Bai Zhujun convened a meeting of the eight county magistrates at the Training Office in the Hidden Courtyard of Chong'an Temple in Wuxi yesterday to discuss the reorganization plan. Except for Taicang, Kunshan, and Jiangyin, which did not send representatives to attend the meeting in Wuxi due to the lack of merchant corps organizations, the remaining five counties of Wuxi, Wu County, Wujin, Jiangyin, and Changshu, all had merchant corps organizations and sent representatives to attend. After discussion, it was decided that the merchant corps in the counties of Wuxi District that employ security guards would naturally be reorganized into security teams, and all volunteer security guards would be abolished. The training, command, and unified collection and expenditure of funds would be the responsibility of the county security general brigade, and the matter would be reported to the Provincial Security Department for approval.</p>

However, after repeated urging from the committee members, he could not refuse and agreed to maintain the position temporarily. Recently, due to his poor health and the various matters pending in the chamber, which could not be delayed due to personal reasons, he again submitted a letter of resignation to the chamber.

<p>Yesterday morning (Thursday), the special express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou ran over an old woman near the Xieqiao Station at 11:15 AM. The woman was carrying a bamboo basket and walking along the side of the tracks. Because she was deaf, she did not avoid the train, causing her to be hit and her right leg to be crushed into two pieces. The scene was bloody and unbearable. The train immediately stopped and used a cloth stretcher to carry her onto the train to be taken to Hangzhou for treatment. However, she had lost too much blood and died just as they arrived at the entrance of the Guangji Hospital. It is said that the woman was over sixty years old and a resident of the Twenty-First Village in the Third Township of Xieqiao.</p>
<p>Young Traveler Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Ying Jiezhen, a 25-year-old man from Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, was a doctor in Shanghai. He came to Hangzhou on the 21st of this month and stayed at No. 18 Cangzhou Inn. The night before last, he met a young woman named Li Zhaodi while enjoying the cool air in the Lakeside Park. Li lived at No. 4 Weihaiwei Road in Shanghai and was visiting relatives in Hangzhou. They met by chance and quickly became friends. Li visited Ying at the inn frequently, and they became very close. Unexpectedly, her mother found out and forbade her from seeing him. Disappointed, Ying committed suicide by taking poison last night. He was discovered by the teahouse waiter in the middle of the night, who reported it to the police and sent him to the hospital for treatment. His life is not yet in danger.</p>

<p>Large Quantity of Red Pills Seized</p>
<p>Zeng Chunshan from Jingjiang used to work as a tea server at the Dasheng No. 3 Factory in this county. Last year, he fled to Shanghai after being involved in a robbery case of a flower vendor at Baojiaqiao. Now he has sneaked back and is secretly manufacturing red pills in the factory city, which are being sold widely. The Changle Town Public Security Second Sub-bureau learned of this a few days ago. Director Li sent Inspector Miao and the police to search the premises, and they seized eight packages of red pills. Zeng Chunshan was taken to the bureau and transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Thorough Investigation of Rumor-Mongering Traitors</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, rumors suddenly spread in the city yesterday, saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was seriously ill. The reporter immediately went to visit Mayor Wu to inquire about the situation. According to Mayor Wu, this was purely the work of speculators in the stock exchange who, for personal gain, did not hesitate to fabricate rumors out of thin air in the hope of achieving their selfish goals, which is extremely despicable. It was learned that Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Guling via Xunyang yesterday (the 29th). Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a farewell banquet before his departure and personally listened to the second phase of the officer corps trainees. This proves that the rumors in the city are entirely fabricated by traitors and have no impact whatsoever. Mayor Wu also said that he has ordered the military police to investigate the rumor-mongers.</p>

<p>Li said that the company's newly purchased Jungers JU-52, 9,500 kg, three-engine large aircraft, departed from Berlin for China early on the 29th of this month, passing through Athens, Cairo, and Petah Tikva. (The aircraft was originally planned to fly to China via Russia and Xinjiang, but due to the unsettled situation in Xinjiang, it was temporarily rerouted to fly to Shanghai via India.) (It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around September 6th. The aircraft's journey from Berlin to Shanghai is 15,000 kilometers and is being piloted by Gablenz, the manager of the German Hansa Airline, and assisted by pilot Otto Tetzo. In addition, there are flight communications officer Heinzgen and flight mechanics Kuschhoff and Daber. The pilot Otto Tetzo is famous for the success of the German-South American postal air service.</p>

<p>This type of aircraft is the latest type of large aircraft in Germany today, equipped with three engines, each with 550 to 700 horsepower. In addition to a wireless broadcast, all new instruments are available. It can also fly in hazy, foggy skies. Its maximum speed is 290 kilometers per hour, and its normal flight speed is 260 kilometers per hour. It has a carrying capacity of 9,200 kilograms. All the equipment inside the aircraft is very suitable for the special conditions of the Eastern routes. In addition to carrying twenty passengers, it also has a cargo hold, and the weight of the mail and cargo carried is equal to the weight of the passengers carried. In the future, it will take only eight hours to travel from Beijing to Guangzhou. This is the first time our country has used this type of aircraft.</p>

In the future, the Ningxia Provincial Government will assist the route's operations and intends to use political power to ensure the security of cargo transportation and will not be responsible for economic losses.

<p>China and Shanghai Banks Establish Branches One After Another</p>
<p>Six Banks, Including Jiao Tong, Handle Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Shanghai banks are paying considerable attention to investing in the development of the Northwest. The Shaanxi branches of the China and Shanghai banks have been established one after another and are offering credit and marketing cooperation loans for the cotton industry. At the same time, the Cotton Improvement Institute has signed contracts with Shanghai Jiao Tong and other banks to handle agricultural loans. According to detailed information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Establishing Branches <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shaanxi branch of the Bank of China was the first to be established and is offering credit cooperative loans for the cotton industry, guiding farmers to organize cooperatives, and directly lending to farmer-organized cooperatives. The total amount of loans issued has reached more than 200,000 yuan. The Shaanxi branch of the Shanghai Bank has been prepared and is scheduled to be established next month. The manager is Lu Jungu, and the deputy manager is concurrently Xu Zhongdi, the director of the Shaanxi Cotton Improvement Institute.</p>
<p>Promoting cotton industry marketing cooperation loans has been underway for some time, and the total amount of loans issued has reached 300,000 yuan. It is heard that other banks in Shanghai, such as Jiao Tong, are also preparing to establish Shaanxi branches.</p>

<p>Urging the Conclusion of the Sino-Persian Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>Maintaining a Corner of the Chinese Tea Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we received a letter from the Foreign Merchants Tea Trade Association this month, stating that Mr. Li Rixi, the Chinese manager of Niu Mazi Foreign Firm, recently wrote that your association's letter of July 2nd, which was forwarded to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, recorded the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegram, stating that the Sino-Persian Commercial Treaty is under negotiation by both parties. Special attention should be paid to the issue of exporting national tea to Persia in the treaty, in order to safeguard rights and interests. The time has been long, but we have not yet seen our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sign a treaty with Persia. The annual export of national tea to Persia is very large, and Persia is indeed a foreign market for national tea. If a commercial treaty is not concluded, the national tea will be restricted by the treatment of countries without treaties, which will be difficult to develop. Furthermore, a large amount of national tea has recently been transported to Persia, but the commercial treaty has not been concluded, so the national tea remains lifeless. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to forward this to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conclude a treaty with Persia as soon as possible." Our chamber is concerned about the delay and believes that exchanging documents should be easy, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that negotiations have reached a considerable stage and that it is unnecessary to exchange documents. We should request your association to use this case to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle it quickly, etc. It has been found that the sales of Chinese tea have long been captured by India, Ceylon, and Java. Even the Russians, who are known for selling Chinese tea, have not made significant progress since the restoration of relations, because the country has adopted a state trading system, reducing unnecessary consumption as much as possible, while also promoting tea production domestically, so it has been difficult to make progress. At this time of extreme difficulty, the sales in the corner of Persia must be maintained. In countries that adopt a multiple tax system for tariffs, the tax levied on countries without treaties is necessarily heavier than that levied on countries with treaties. Therefore, before the Sino-Persian Commercial Treaty is signed, there is no hope of reducing the tax on Chinese tea exported to Persia. Commercial treaties between the two countries have complex clauses and involve many issues, which may not be completed in a short time. Persia has signed goodwill treaties for more than ten</p>
<p>years, but a commercial treaty has not yet been concluded, which is a clear sign. Because our country's tariffs are based on a single tax system, with or without a treaty, the treatment is the same, they do not feel the need for a commercial treaty. In case of obstacles, or the negotiations are stopped and started, or the signing is delayed, then the sales of Chinese tea will follow the same path as the new Sino-French Vietnam treaty. We hereby re-telegraph, earnestly requesting your ministry to review, graciously grant quick handling, which is for the public good. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Qian."</p>

<p>The long-distance telephone network for the nine provinces, with Nanjing as the center, plans to build five main trunk lines to connect the telephone communications of the nine provinces. The so-called five main trunk lines are (1) the Jinghan Line, from Nanjing via Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang to Hankou. This line is busy with military, political, and commercial communications, and it is planned to install three pairs of copper wires. (2) The Jingjin Line, from Jingdupu, via Xuzhou and Jinan, to Tianjin. It is also planned to install three pairs of copper wires. (3) The Jiqing Line, from Jinan to Qingdao, has two pairs of copper wires, and it is planned to add one pair. The cost of replacing the poles along the line is high. (4) The Xuzheng Line, from Xuzhou along the Longhai Road to Zhengzhou. (5) The Hanchang Line, from Hankou along the Wuchang Line to Changsha. Due to the simple telephone traffic on the above two lines, it is planned to install one pair of copper wires each for the time being, and it is also planned to install various boosters in suitable locations in the nine provinces to facilitate direct telephone communication between the nine provinces.</p>

<p>In addition to the construction of the five main trunk lines by the Ministry of Communications and various equipment along the lines, it is also necessary to add two pairs of copper wires for the Shanghai-Hangzhou trunk line and along the Beijing-Hangzhou highway. The total cost of all necessary expenses has been estimated by Hu Ruixiang, Director of the Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone Engineering Office, to be 5 million yuan. In addition to borrowing 200,000 pounds from the Gengkuan, equivalent to 3 million national currency, and raising another 1.2 million yuan from the Ministry of Communications, an additional 800,000 yuan has been borrowed from the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to promote its completion. Director Yan Renguang and Director Tang Baoshu have met several times to discuss the loan. The Postal and Telecommunications departments have generally drafted the loan contract. Shen Shi News Agency reporters learned yesterday that the main terms of the contract include (1) a long-distance telephone loan of 800,000 yuan for the nine provinces; (2) an annual interest rate of 1%; (3) the income from the Department of Telecommunications and other businesses is long-term stored at 100,000 yuan as a guarantee for principal and interest repayment; (4) after the completion of the five main trunk lines, it will be repaid in six years. The above main terms have been generally agreed upon, and once they are submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval, they can be formally signed.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Korean Residents' Independence Party, etc., Issue Declarations on the Anniversary of the Japan-Korea Merger <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Our Correspondent's Report from this City: Yesterday (29th) was the day the Japanese merged with Korea, a day of national shame for the Korean people. Yesterday, various organizations such as the Korean Residents' Independence Party, the Provisional Government, and the Patriotic Women's Association of this city held the 24th National Shame Anniversary. Our office has received various declarations, and the main points are translated below:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Korean Independence Party: "Amid the tense atmosphere of the Far Eastern War launched by our enemies as a final gamble, amid the cries of our compatriots at home and abroad who have been forced to the brink of death under the cruel oppression of the enemy, amid the anti-Japanese cries of the international revolutionary masses that are rising and expanding day by day, the 24th National Shame Anniversary of the 'Korea-Japan Merger', which we must never forget, has arrived again. Today is the day when Japanese imperialism openly seized all the political and economic sovereignty and production organs and resources necessary for our national life. From then on, we lost our national freedom, and the three words 'slave of a lost country', the synonym for the greatest shame, were imprinted on our backs. All the tragic realities of starving to death with grievances and being beaten to death for no reason are the result of today's shameful record. We have lost the right to speak out in the world and the right to cooperate for common happiness, which is the result of our failure to cancel today's shame. Today is a shameful, painful, and hateful day that our Korean nation and other oppressed nations in the same situation as us cannot forget. Year after year, the meaning of our commemoration of today is not merely to recognize the history of shame and pain, but to increase our determination and strength to fight in order to eliminate the history of shame and complete the revolution. Our urgent task is to expand and strengthen the fighting organization, closely connect the anti-Japanese forces at home and abroad, determine the overall practical strategy, and heroically launch a national struggle that includes the economic interests of the masses."</p>
<p>Also, the main points of the declaration of the Korean Provisional Government are: "1. Promote armed movements; 2. Encourage overall unity; 3. Pay attention to the enemy's tactics and consolidate our front."</p>
<p>Also, the main points of the declaration of the Patriotic Women's Association are: "Our enemy has already reached its final crisis. We should take this opportunity to develop an indomitable and unyielding spirit, drive out the forces of evil, and return our mountains and rivers. This is the meaning of our commemoration of the national shame."</p>
<h3 id="e162">The New Third Dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard Will Be Completed in Mid-September <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the construction of the new Third Dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department has been underway for a long time. Initially, a large number of nanmu piles were discovered during excavation, and removing them one by one took a lot of time. Subsequently, the rapid rise of the Yangtze River tides made the work difficult. Therefore, the project has been delayed until now and has not yet been completed. The shipyard previously estimated that the entire project could be completed by the end of this month and scheduled the completion ceremony for September 1st. According to the person in charge of the shipyard, the construction of the Third Dock will have to be postponed until mid-September before it can be completed. As for the date of the completion ceremony, it will be determined after the entire project is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Unit Should Be Added After Numbers in Chinese Telegrams <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Units of Numbers Such as "Jin," "Yuan," "Hao," "Liang," etc., Will Be Implemented Uniformly Nationwide Starting September 1st</p>
<p>In order to reduce the burden on the public for sending telegrams, the Ministry of Communications previously formulated the "Measures for Writing House Numbers and Various Numbers in Arabic Numerals in Chinese Telegrams." The measures stipulated that numbers (such as five thousand six hundred seventeen yuan and seven jiao) could be written as (5617) yuan using Arabic numerals, and charged as two characters. It was also stipulated that if the meaning of the numbers in the context proved that they were indeed representing the quantity of silver or commodities, there was no need to add unit words such as "jin," "yuan," "jiao," or "pieces." For example, the sentence "Remittance (5000) yuan" could omit the word "yuan" and be written as "Remittance (5000)." Since implementation, the various sectors have saved a lot of money when sending Chinese telegrams. However, some merchants have overused the measure of omitting units, resulting in numbers appearing one after another in a brief telegram. Due to the omission of all units, it was impossible to determine whether they were codes or plain text. According to regulations, coded telegrams are charged double. Senders, seeking to simplify the number of words, made the telegram very similar to a code. However, if charged as a code, the telegram fee would increase. Therefore, misunderstandings often arose between the sender and the telegraph office. The regulations, originally intended to facilitate the public, became the main cause of disputes. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications specially issued an order to amend the original measures. According to an official of the Shanghai Telegraph Office, the ministry order has been received and will be implemented uniformly nationwide from September 1st. The main idea of the amended articles is that units must be added after Arabic numerals in Chinese plain text telegrams, such as (345) jin, (6.78) yuan, etc. If the units such as jin and yuan are not specified in the telegram, the entire telegram will be charged as a coded message.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Municipal Authorities Rectify House Tax <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the municipal authorities recently reported that some landlords had underreported rents or had not reported rent increases. After the municipal government instructed the Public Security and Finance Bureaus to conduct spot checks in Zhabei and Nanshi, such situations were indeed found. As this matter greatly affected the municipal government's tax revenue, the two bureaus were immediately ordered to conduct district-by-district investigations and carry out rectification. Taxes will be collected according to the accurate figures obtained from the investigation, in order to demonstrate fairness and enrich tax revenue. It is reported that the investigation work is about to be completed.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday regarding the salt content in imported chemicals and dyes. The notice stated: "It has been found that imported mordants and other chemicals contain salt. The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has now stipulated that the content of sodium chloride (i.e., table salt) is limited to 20%. The following measures should be followed immediately: (1) All mordants and other chemicals containing more than 20% sodium chloride (i.e., table salt) are generally prohibited from import.

<h3 id="e173">The Municipal Council Has Agreed to Modify the Hotel Patrol Tax <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council will collect the hotel patrol tax based on room rental rates starting November 1st. The industry believes that this move is tantamount to a disguised business tax and has repeatedly appealed to express its opposition. It is now heard that the Municipal Council is no longer as insistent as in the past and is willing to discuss and modify it further.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Nanshi Rent Reduction Association Petitions Party and Government <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee, since its establishment, has been under the leadership of party discipline and entrusted by the citizens. It has taken reasonable and legal measures and received the sympathy of landlords who understand the general situation. As a result, rent reductions have been gradually resolved. The difficulty lies in the fact that tenants demand rent reductions from landlords and declare that they have deposited the rent in the bank, but the landlords turn a deaf ear and still file lawsuits for rent arrears. Although the court cannot bear to completely disregard public opinion, it still ignores the evidence of tenants' demands for rent reductions and the evidence of deposits in the bank based on the landlords' one-sided statements. As a result, they seek peace but feel uneasy. The rent has not been reduced, but the burden of litigation has increased first. They demand cost savings, but are forced to open up new sources of income. At this time, it is only possible to publish a special edition of the Shanghai Rent Reduction publication to gently appeal, hoping that the public will be enlightened and save the precarious Shanghai. Due to insufficient funds, a small fee of two jiao per month is charged for printing paper, which has been understood by the party and government. Now, for the sake of widespread publicity, the fee has been reduced to one jiao, but it has been envied by those who are jealous. In desperation, all branch meetings have decided to unanimously stop paying rent and deposit the rent in the bank. A large-scale petition will be held on September 1st. The petition has been temporarily postponed after Shen Xinwu, a standing committee member of the association, discovered that it was the anniversary of the Communist Party. The petition is recorded below, appealing for the decline of the municipal situation and the deterioration of people's livelihood, requesting rent reduction to alleviate the people's difficulties and revitalize Shanghai. Since its establishment, the association has been under the leadership of party discipline and entrusted by the citizens, proceeding cautiously and appealing in an orderly manner. Although a few landlords who understand the general situation have reduced rents in consideration of commercial difficulties, there are also many who seek only profit and disregard the people's suffering, and some who wait and see without seeing clear documents. If this drags on, there will be more problems, and the relationship between hosts and guests will be damaged, leading to more disputes over rent reduction. In the recent situation, shops are deserted, and court courtyards are as crowded as markets. Although it has been repeatedly stated that the rent is deposited in the bank, summonses for rent collection continue to arrive, and judgments for eviction follow one after another. If a solution is not urgently sought, it will inevitably lead to bankruptcy and closure, and Shanghai's merchants will be almost wiped out. Therefore, in desperation, we unite all the district branches in the city and appeal to the authorities to consider the situation in Shanghai and the suffering of merchants, and request the implementation of rent reduction according to the precedent of Anqing, the capital, so that merchants can survive and seek recovery. We dare not make a moaning without illness, but deeply feel the pain and appeal.</p>

<p>Opening Postponed to the 5th of Next Month</p>
<p>The Manufacturers Association Notified All Manufacturers Yesterday</p>
<p>And Telegraphed Various Circles in Yangzhou for Assistance</p>
<p>The Yangzhou National Goods Exhibition, which was moved from Zhenjiang by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers United Association, was originally scheduled to open on September 1st. However, due to the enthusiastic participation of various manufacturers, exceeding the planned number of booths, the original venue was insufficient. It was necessary to expand the scope and find another venue, which led to delays and inability to open as scheduled. It is now known that the association has separately determined the Yangzhou Orphanage as the venue. The construction of the reed sheds is also nearing completion, and the opening has been confirmed for September 5th. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Notice of Postponement <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the notice, the Yangzhou National Goods Exhibition originally scheduled to open on September 1st, with the address tentatively at the old site of the Yangzhou Grand Stage Small Vegetable Market. However, due to the participation of manufacturers exceeding the original budget, the old site of the Small Vegetable Market was insufficient. It was decided to use the original site of the Yangzhou Poor Children's Home as the venue. The transfer and docking in the middle delayed the time, so the opening could not be held as scheduled on September 1st. Yesterday, we received a letter from the association's representative stationed in Yangzhou, stating that the Poor Children's Home has now been determined as the venue. All reed shed construction projects will be completed soon, and the lottery will be drawn on September 2nd to determine the location. The official opening will be on the 5th. A special notice is hereby given, requesting that preparations be made as soon as possible, and please send cadres to Yangzhou to attend and participate in the grand ceremony on the opening day of the National Goods Exhibition. This notice is hereby given.</p>

<p>The association specially telegraphed various agencies such as the Yangzhou County Party Department yesterday, saying: "Yangzhou County Party Department, County Government, County Public Security Bureau, County Public Education Center, County Chamber of Commerce, and Yangzhou County Journalists Association, various news agencies, and various newspapers, all greetings. Promoting national goods is of paramount importance, and a national goods exhibition is the most effective publicity strategy for promoting national goods. The association, in view of the importance of promoting national goods, specially led the manufacturers participating in the Zhenjiang Provincial National Goods Exhibition to Yangzhou to exhibit national goods, with the aim of achieving considerable publicity for national goods and making the national goods industry progress day by day. According to a letter from the association's representative stationed in Yangzhou, the Yangzhou National Goods Exhibition has been prepared and is scheduled to hold the opening ceremony on the designated day. A special letter is sent to request assistance and guidance at that time, so that there is something to follow, which will benefit national goods. The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers United Association bows."</p>

<p>Zhu Shuqiao, Zhu Fengxiang, and Cang Gongwen Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Zheng Fa'zhu and He Wushan Both Declare Appeal</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee stipulated a reduction in rickshaw fares, conflicts have occurred several times between rickshaw owners and pullers. On the 9th and 10th of this month, some vagrants and a small number of rickshaw pullers, with ulterior motives, took the opportunity to deflate tires, disrupting public order. The next day, the Shanghai Municipal Council, upon receiving reports, arrested seven people successively: rickshaw pullers Xing Hongxi, Cang Gongsen, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, Zheng Fa'qiu, and former Qingnian Hui Middle School student Zhu Shuqiao. They were charged with obstructing freedom and property damage and prosecuted by the First Special District Court. Lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Yu Chenghou, Zhang Yifan, Gu Ao, Xiang Xun, Yu Jiazhen, and Chen Changsheng volunteered to defend Xing Hongxi, Cang Gongsen, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, and He Wushan. Fu Ganghou defended Zheng Fa'zhu, and Wu Linkun and Yao Yongli defended Zhu Shuqiao. The rickshaw owners also engaged lawyers Chen Tingrui and Wu Kaisheng to handle the civil aspects, seeking compensation for damages. Presiding Judge Zhan Liangce held four court hearings, each packed with spectators and filled with tension, causing a sensation throughout Shanghai and attracting attention from both Chinese and foreigners. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the verdict. At 8:30 in the morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese and foreign lawyers and defense</p>

<p>Zhabei Gradually Recovering Prosperity</p>
<p>A Conversation with Wang Binyan</p>
<p>Zhabei has suffered deeply from the January 28th Incident. Although the municipal authorities and local elders have been working hard on its reconstruction, there is a trend toward gradual recovery. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has made a special record of the situation below.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Idea of a Tramline Has Been Around for a While <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Datong News Agency went to the residence of Wang Binyan, of the Shanghai Northern Business Community, on Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, and personally interviewed Mr. Wang. He was granted an audience, and the reporter first asked if he had heard about the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's plan to build a tramline in Zhabei, as reported in the newspapers. Mr. Wang said that the plan to operate trams in Zhabei did not start today. Last spring, Lu Bohong and Xu Chunrong (founders of the Nanshi Water and Electricity Company) strongly advocated it and asked me to join them as initiators. Later, because the municipal government already had a complete plan for the reconstruction of Zhabei, Mr. Lu and others thought that the government's undertaking would certainly be more perfect than a commercial one, so they did not want to overstep their authority, and the matter became quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang continued, saying that the route planning for the tramline was very complete at the time, including Datong Road, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhongshan Road, Baoxing Road, Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, etc., forming a circular route. At the same time, it also crossed Zhongshan Road to connect with the trams in Nanshi, and another line was opened directly to the city center. Whether the current route plan of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau adopts the original plan, I cannot guess. However, this move is of great help to the revitalization of northern Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Scars Still Visible, Prosperity Gradually Recovering <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked Mr. Wang about the reconstruction of Zhabei after the war. Mr. Wang replied that Zhabei has been scarred since the January 28th Incident. However, with the assistance of the municipal authorities and the efforts of the Zhabei merchants, the morale of the people and the state of the market have shown a good recovery and prosperity. Recently, the Commercial Press factory building on Baoshan Road, of which the undamaged portion, the company has been mending. This act has been very impressionable to the residents of Zhabei, so the houses destroyed by the war between Baoshan Road and Baoxing Road are being built one after another, and construction is booming. If we can continue like this, it will be able to restore its former appearance in no more than two or three years.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Tax Revenue Recovering to Former Levels <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reporter then went to the Municipal Northern Tax Collection Office on Datong Road and met with Cao Xinchu, a clerk in the collection section. When asked about the tax revenue situation, Mr. Cao said that the office is responsible for the seven districts of Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, Tangqiao, Yinhang, and Pengpu. Jiangwan and Yinhang districts have suffered more from the war, so tax revenue is still sluggish. Tax revenue in Zhabei and other districts is gradually recovering to the pre-war state. Before the January 28th Incident, property tax revenue was about 240,000 per quarter, but now it has gradually recovered to about 200,000. Other taxes, such as entertainment tax, have recovered to the pre-war collection amount. However, stall taxes are only about 60% of what they were before, which suggests that the wounds of the coolies have not yet healed. However, due to the recent opening of the land price tax and the transfer of tobacco and alcohol license taxes to the municipal government for collection, as well as the implementation of the slaughter tax, the total monthly income is about 120,000 yuan, which is even more than before the Shanghai war.</p>

<p>Facilitating Passengers at Hangzhou Station</p>
<p>Contract Signed with Longfei Company for Shuttle Service</p>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Two Roads Bureau, recognizing the large number of passengers traveling to and from Hangzhou Station, specially contacted the Hangzhou Longfei Automobile Company to arrange shuttle services for passengers, in order to facilitate travel. The two parties negotiated a draft contract, which was submitted to the Roads Bureau for formal signing and has now been implemented. The contract stipulates that the Roads Bureau allows the Longfei Automobile Company to shuttle passengers only to and from Hangzhou Station. This operating franchise cannot be transferred. However, if the company violates the contract, its franchise will be revoked after three warnings from the Roads Bureau. If the company wants to terminate the contract midway, it must give advance notice and stop providing vehicles only after a replacement contractor has been found. The car fare within the city shall be in accordance with the agreed price, and the long distance shall be in accordance with the price stipulated by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, and the passengers are not allowed to solicit tips, and so on.</p>

<p>Not Allowed to Take Temple Property</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Interior to the Buddhist Association to Comply</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association received an instruction from the Ministry of Interior yesterday, which read: "The case was approved by the Hebei Provincial Government No. 200, based on the report from the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, based on the report from the Joint Civilian Education Association of the Chinese Buddhist Association in Ji County, Yu County, and San County, requesting an interpretation of whether monks and Taoists returning to secular life can take away property purchased under the name of the monk or Taoist. Please forward this request for review." The reply was approved. "After investigation, it was found that if the property purchased under the name of a monk or Taoist was purely operated with the surplus of temple property, it should still be regarded as the property of the temple. When monks and Taoists return to secular life, they cannot take it out of the temple." The Association is hereby ordered to instruct its members to comply with the regulations.</p>

<p>For Collecting Fees for Honor Guard Permits</p>
<p>No Continuation of the Old System from the Qing Dynasty Allowed</p>
<p>Implemented Starting September 10th</p>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Wen Hongen, stated that residents of this city often overspend on weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Some even continue the old system from the Qing Dynasty, forming parades that are bizarre and varied. This not only wastes money and fosters extravagance but also damages the national image. Lawyers Zhang Yifan, Yao Yongli, and Fu Ganghou arrived at court early, and the gallery was full. After Judge Zhan Liangce took his seat, lawyer Yao Yongli stood up and requested permission for Zhu Maocheng, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Traffic Committee, to express his opinion. Judge Zhan stated that since the case had already been declared closed for debate and Zhu Maocheng was not a defendant in the case, he could not speak. He then immediately announced the verdict: "Zheng Fa'zhu and He Wushan (i.e., He Liansheng) are each sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of jointly instigating others to use violence and coercion to obstruct others from exercising their rights. The rest of the defendants are found not guilty. Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, and Zhu Shuqiao are all found not guilty." Before the judgment is finalized for Zheng and He, the number of days of detention shall be used to offset one day of imprisonment for every two days. The Shanghai Municipal Council's lawyer, Ru Bao'yi, immediately declared that he would waive the right to appeal for the defendants who were declared not guilty and released them immediately. Zheng and He both expressed dissatisfaction and must file appeals. During the appeal period, they requested permission to post bail. The court checked the tickets and ordered Zheng and He to each post a bail of 400 yuan to be released.</p>
<p>Therefore, thirteen measures have been specially formulated to banish bad habits, and have been submitted to the municipal government for approval, and will be implemented from September 10. The announcement and measures are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Announcement <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau issued Announcement No. 22, stating: "It has been found that residents of this city often use honor guards for weddings, funerals, and other events, and some even violate the ban and continue the old system from the Qing Dynasty, or contain feudal colors, adding splendor and dazzling the eyes, forming teams to parade through the city, without feeling strange.

In order to banish bad habits, this bureau has drafted measures for issuing permits for honor guard parades, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and ordered to be followed. It is now scheduled to be implemented from the tenth of this month.

<p>Conflict between Soft and Hard Factions</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Police to Increase Crackdown</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Daily News, the immoral soft faction among the Japanese dancers in the dance halls on East Qiujiang Road often flirts with the dancers every night, staging all kinds of ugly scenes, causing opposition from the hard faction. The hard faction believes that such charming behavior tarnishes the reputation of the Japanese and degrades the dancers' character. However, the soft faction, in order to attract customers, mostly agrees. Therefore, the soft and hard factions have become opposed to each other. At the same time, the musicians have also joined the vortex and declared their withdrawal. The content of each dance hall has become very chaotic. However, the police of the Japanese Consulate General, in order to eliminate immoral dancers, will take decisive measures. The outcome is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Mutual Lawsuit Between Fu Xiao'an and Yan Dajue <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Final Arguments Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for the 31st</p>
<p>Fu Claims No "Activities" to Return to Shanghai After Pardon</p>
<p>Yan Claims Ordinary Warning, No Intimidation</p>
<p>Fu Xiao'an, a Ningbo native and general manager of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, recently engaged lawyers Dai Chengxiang and Qin Liankui to file a complaint in the First Special District Court against Yan Dajue, a Cantonese lawyer, for intimidation. The reason for the lawsuit was that Dai Zhenwu, the owner of the Dai Shengchang Steamship Company (who had become a Japanese citizen), owed the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank tens of thousands of yuan. Fu filed a lawsuit with the Japanese Consulate, and the result was a judgment that Dai should repay 73,000 yuan in foreign currency. Dai then claimed that this amount was Fu's "activities" fee, and negotiated with Fu. He also stated that his lawyer, Yano, was a Japanese citizen and could not appear in a Chinese court, so Yano appointed lawyer Yan Dajue as his sub-agent and sent a letter to Fu Xiao'an stating the facts, saying that Fu should compensate all the reputational and financial losses suffered by him and should reply clearly within five days, otherwise he would file a criminal lawsuit. After receiving the letter, Fu believed that lawyer Yan had engaged in intimidating behavior and therefore filed a lawsuit. The court had already interrogated the case once and ordered the two parties to try to reconcile outside the court. These details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, this case was further examined by Judge Liu Yugui in the Ninth Criminal Court. Fu Xiao'an also personally surrendered to the court. According to Fu, as the general manager of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, after receiving the letter from lawyer Yan, which stated, "I should compensate for the loss of reputation and money, and reply clearly within five days, otherwise I will file a criminal lawsuit," I thought that this kind of thing was worthless, so I ignored it. Unexpectedly, after a few days, there was another registered letter from lawyer Yan, saying that if I still ignored it, I would definitely file a criminal lawsuit. In order to safeguard the commercial reputation and understand the truth, I asked a lawyer to reply with a letter. Unexpectedly, after receiving the two letters from lawyer Yan, rumors suddenly arose, saying that I was engaging in malfeasance and embezzlement. There are more than a thousand employees in my bank. If I remained silent and did not defend myself, it would be as if it were true, so I had to surrender to the court and file a lawsuit. Moreover, I have never met lawyer Yan before, so there is no enmity between us. It is really because this matter has too much impact on society and the banking industry that I cannot remain silent. Moreover, I have lived in Shanghai for decades. I returned to Shanghai from Dalian in 1931 after receiving a pardon. There were no "activities" with the Nationalist Government and asking Dai Zhenwu to find a way to raise this small amount of tens of thousands of yuan. As for Dai Zhenwu, because he had dealings with the Hongkou branch of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, there were a total of three account names, one was Dai Zhenwu, the second was Zhenjiang Dai Shengchang, and the third was Shanghai Dai Shengchang. Because of the outstanding bank loans, I filed a lawsuit with the Japanese Consulate, and a judgment has now been made to repay the amount. Now the defendant, lawyer Yan, without asking the truth of the matter, rashly sent a letter of intimidation based on the empty words of the Japanese lawyer Yano, so he should be punished according to the law. When asked, the defendant Yan Dajue claimed that when I sent the first letter, I did not know if the plaintiff had received it, so I registered the second letter with the post office, but the wording inside was exactly the same as the first letter, and the drafts of my letters were all reviewed by lawyer Yano. Therefore, this matter was originally handled by Yano, and I was a sub-agent. Moreover, the words in the letter were all ordinary warnings, asking him to reply clearly, and there was no intimidating behavior at all. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawsuit this time is actually of a slanderous nature, so I filed a counterclaim. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, Qin Liankui, stated that the mediation of this case was unsuccessful. Judge Liu ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's agents, lawyers Dai and Qin, stated that this case is divided into two points: a private prosecution for intimidation and a counterclaim for slander. Regarding the private prosecution, Article 1540 of the Judicial Yuan's instruction to the higher courts of all provinces and regions on July 5, 1932, states: "If a crime or tort is committed by an agent, he shall not be exempted from liability because he is an agent. However, recently, there have been cases where people have published announcements or statements in newspapers in the name of representing others, and if there is any damage to the reputation of others or other illegal circumstances, the agent is not responsible because of his status as an agent. This view is a misunderstanding. In the future, when such incidents occur, the courts should investigate and deal with them according to the circumstances and in accordance with the law. If the court believes that the defendant has committed a crime or a tort, it shall not be considered that he is naturally not responsible because he is an agent. Therefore, all courts are hereby notified, and all subordinate courts are hereby instructed." In this case, whether the defendant's act of sending a letter to the plaintiff in the name of Dai Zhenwu constitutes the crime of attempted intimidation should be clearly judged. After investigation, it was found that the letters issued by the defendant were all his own claims and were not based on Dai's commission. Therefore, the defendant should be responsible. As for the counterclaim for slander, according to the provisions of the criminal law for the crime of slander, it is necessary to know that the facts are false and accuse them to the official government before the crime of slander can be constituted. Now the facts of this case are all there, how can it be called slander? It should be refuted. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Sheng Peidong, argued that the occurrence of this case was due to lawyer Yan Dajue being commissioned by Yano to send a letter to Fu Xiao'an on behalf of Dai Zhenwu. According to Fu's accusation that the letter was intimidating, saying that "if you do not reply clearly within five days, I will file a criminal lawsuit," the establishment of the crime of intimidation requires two elements: (1) there must be an intimidating act that causes the other party to feel fear; (2) there must be an intention to illegally obtain the property or illegal interests of others. Now, reading the letter issued by lawyer Yan, it only says to reply clearly within five days, otherwise I will file a criminal lawsuit. It can be seen that there is no intention to illegally obtain the property or illegal interests of others, but only to express that he wants to ask the court for a proper solution. Moreover, lawyer Yan, according to my instructions, is a legal agent, and the issuance of letters is in accordance with the procedures. How can it be called joint intimidation? According to the above situation, there is no doubt that he is venting his anger on the defendant and is determined to frame him. The private prosecution should be dismissed and a counterclaim for slander should be filed. Judge Liu reviewed the report and ordered the debate to be closed. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at the afternoon of the thirty-first of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Qinfeng Textile Factory Stealing Electricity <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Electricity Company Loses 40,000</p>
<p>Meter Reader Involved</p>
<p>The Qinfeng Textile Factory, located at No. 162 Rue du Père Froc, French Concession, recently secretly opened the electricity meter used and reduced the moving parts to steal electricity. The matter was discovered by the French Electricity Company, which reported it to the French Concession Police. Detective Sui Wenzhi and Western Detective Malone were ordered to go to the factory to investigate and found that it was true. They dismantled the reduced meter and took Li Fengji (40 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 3, Tianxiang Lane, Beile Road), the manager and accountant of the factory, to the police station. According to Li's confession, Yao Rucheng, a Jiangyin native who lives at No. 1, Ren'an Lane, Xiaonanmen and reads meters for the Electricity Company, colluded with Zhang Erlong, a blacksmith for the Electricity Company (residing at No. 90, Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road), Li Yukang (residing at No. 9, Lane 244, Xujiahui Road), and Wang Shixiang (residing at No. 11, Desheng Lane, White Road), a coppersmith and electrician, to steal electricity. Detective Sui then arrested Yao and Zhang. Li and Wang fled after hearing the news. After being questioned by the police, they were ordered to be detained and yesterday transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. First, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated the case and said that the case had not yet been investigated clearly and requested a postponement. After Judge Wu Fanglian reviewed the confession, he ordered the three defendants to be returned to custody and granted a postponement for further questioning. It is reported that the Electricity Company found that the Qinfeng Textile Factory had been stealing electricity for two years, with a total loss of 40,000 yuan, and has already hired a lawyer to file a private lawsuit.</p>

<p>Since the city began to vigorously promote the New Life Movement, it has paid close attention to the cleanliness of the streets. Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, and Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, accompanied by Jiang Shicheng, Director of the Cleaning Section of the Municipal Health Bureau, led dozens of health police officers and cleaners to Zhabei District yesterday morning to inspect the cleanliness of the streets along the way.

As a result, the streets in the Zhabei area were suddenly renewed. It is reported that the two directors will continue to inspect other districts.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Hongxiang Xing Factory Builds Its Own Trawler <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Can Be Completed and Applied in November</p>
<p>The Daily News reported that Chinese fishermen mostly used sailboats to fish more than a decade ago. The fishing methods were old-fashioned. Later, under the advocacy and guidance of the fishing industry, they successively built fishing vessels and used machines to catch fish, but the vessels built were not new-style and had very little horsepower. Therefore, most of the fishing vessels in the various fishing areas now are old and dilapidated vessels from many years ago. It is now known that the Hongxiang Xing Machinery Shipyard in Pudong, this city, built its own newest type of trawler in April of this year. The vessel is 135 feet long, 23 feet wide, and has 600 horsepower. The internal machinery is all made of pure steel, which is strong and durable. Since the start of construction, most of the work has been completed. By the end of November of this year, it will be completed and applied. It is reported that after the vessel is completed, the factory plans to sail into the coastal areas to catch fish and is currently applying to the Ministry of Industry for registration and licensing.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Ningbo Industrial Bank <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Application for Small Loans</p>
<p>In recent years, idle capital has concentrated in cities, leading to the accelerated decline of rural areas and the phenomenon of abnormal urban development. After the financial sector absorbs idle capital, it often invests in real estate construction and various speculative businesses. Therefore, although cities appear to be increasingly prosperous on the surface, the expansion of these non-urgent needs has a significant direct impact on people's livelihoods because it fails to organize and regulate the absorbed idle capital. In view of this, the Ningbo Industrial Bank of this city has specially established a small loan department to provide loans in order to regulate the economy of the middle class and below in this city. Since its opening, in less than ten days, the number of people who have gone to the bank to obtain articles of association and application forms has reached hundreds every day. From other places, such as the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, and even as far as Henan and Hankou, several letters are sent every day to request the articles of association, which shows that small loans are an essential plan to support industry and commerce today. It is now known that after investigation, more than 300 households have been qualified after review. Since receiving the bank's notification, they have been processing the formalities one after another, and the borrowers are all very happy. It is also heard that the bank has newly established a national product revolving collateral loan to support the production and sales development of national product industry and commerce. Recently, many people have been going to the bank to negotiate mortgages.</p>

<p>Yesterday Summoned Detective Team Leader for Commendation</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported the recent major drug case involving Lu Ying and the situation of the wanted criminals to the municipal government for record and requested instructions. After Mayor Wu reviewed the report, he believed that Lu Ying, the team leader, had led his subordinates to solve many cases of morphine and red pill criminals, which was enough to show his efforts. He specially notified Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, by telephone the day before yesterday, and ordered him to relay the commendation. Wen immediately conveyed Mayor Wu's instructions and personally instructed Captain Lu at 6 pm that afternoon, asking him to go and wait for instructions. After receiving the instructions, Lu went to the municipal government on time yesterday afternoon to report. Mayor Wu Tiecheng summoned him to the office and instructed Lu, saying that morphine and red pill drugs are even more harmful than opium. Strict arrest and prosecution are necessary.

<p>Confiscates One Handgun and Six Hand Grenades</p>
<p>Confesses to Robbery Cases, All Verified by Victims</p>
<p>At about 10 pm the night before last, Li Guiqing, a detective from the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei, received a tip that bandits with guns were committing crimes in the Jiaotong Road-Zhongshan Road area. The detective immediately reported to the squad leader Wang Shifu, Geng Shoushi, and deputy squad leader Zhang Yingpin, leading Miao Jinhai, Chen Guiqing, and Xie Qihua, who were in a secret meeting. Because the bandits did not know that the detective team was coming, they were captured together. A 6-inch Browning handgun was confiscated from one of the bandits, containing six bullets. The handgun number was checked to be 7806. After being taken to the district, one of the bandits confessed his name was Wu Hongtu, 25 years old, from Yancheng, living in a shack on Jiaotong Road, unknown door number. Another bandit named Dong A'gen, 21 years old, from Ningbo, living in a shack on Gaolang Bridge, Yangshupu. Another bandit claimed his name was Xi Zhishan, 30 years old, from Lianshui, living on Changsha Road, Xinzha Road, concession. Another bandit named Wei Guihe, 29 years old, from Funing, living in Xujiazhai Road, Chaomi Beach. The four bandits all confessed that they had accomplices named Luo Si, Li Xiaowuzi, and Wang A'er, etc. They planned to rob an old woman from Jiangbei on a boat on Zhongshan Road. The old woman was returning to Jiangbei with 130 yuan, but the old woman did not come, so they gathered there to discuss. They also confessed to robbing Tianyuantang, No. 59, Linjiagang, Caojiadu seven or eight days ago, robbing a silversmith in Xujiazhai Lane, Chaomi Beach ten days ago, and robbing the Shanghai Rubber Overshoe Factory in Rihui Port twenty days ago. After obtaining the confessions, the interrogating official ordered the detective team to arrest the accomplices but failed. Only the bandit wives Li Gu's, 22 years old, wife of Li Xiaowuzi, and Wu Shen's, 25 years old, wife of Wu Hongtu, were arrested. Yesterday, Han Huairen, the owner of Tianyuantang, Linjiagang, Caojiadu, was also summoned. According to him, at 6 pm on the 29th of last month, four bandits with three handguns robbed him of more than 20 pieces of clothing, one watch, 176 jiao, one jade bracelet, 26 yuan, and 400 copper coins. The bandits fired their guns to show off before leaving and had reported it to the Sixth District. Zhu Linjie, the owner of the silversmith at No. 7 Guidel Lane, Xujiazhai Road, said that on the third day of the lunar calendar, that is, August 12 of the Gregorian calendar, at about 7 pm, five or six bandits came with three handguns and robbed him of 12 yuan, 11 yuan, more than 30 pieces of silver, and one piece each of long and short shirts made of original Indian silk. Lin Anding, the owner of Rihui Port, said that at about 10 am on the first day of this month, he took 800 yuan in one-yuan notes, 450 yuan in five-yuan notes, and 200 yuan in jiao notes, totaling 1,400 yuan, from the wholesale store on Sijing Road to distribute wages to the factory. When he was more than ten steps away from the factory building, he was stopped by bandits and robbed of all the banknotes. The interrogating official believed that the robbery cases confessed by the bandits were all verified by the victims and ordered them to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Forensic Doctor Proves Death from Illness</p>
<p>Family Refuses Autopsy</p>
<p>Xu Rusheng, a native of this county residing at No. 68 Shendeli, Xihuade Road, had a son named Bingquan, born for only six months. He suddenly suffered from heatstroke a week ago. At first, he hired a doctor named Dou to treat him. Later, because he admired the name of pediatric doctor Zhong Jintao, he hired a car to Zhong's clinic at No. 6 Xiangfen Lane at 3 pm on the 25th of the month to seek treatment. At that time, Zhong immediately used force to massage the child's whole body. Xu told Zhong to massage lighter, but Zhong did not listen. Then he stretched a tongue depressor into Bingquan's mouth, intending to hold down the tongue to observe the condition of the throat. Unexpectedly, the tongue depressor went deep into the mouth, and the child vomited immediately. He died of suffocation not long after. After Xu reported to the Laozha Police Station, he ordered detectives to investigate and sent the body to the autopsy office on Feilun Road. Yesterday, Prosecutor Tang of the First Special Court came to the office to examine the body. After questioning all parties, according to the forensic report, it seemed to be death from illness, so he ordered that it was death from illness and the body was handed over to Xu Shansheng to be taken back for coffin preparation. During the examination, forensic doctor Zhang Yan had stated to the family that if a detailed examination of the cause of death was required, an autopsy was necessary, but Xu refused, so no autopsy was performed.</p>

Wan Fuhua confessed that at about 7 pm that evening, a civilian holding a lunch box passed by upstairs and accidentally touched the wooden board, causing it to fall. However, at that time, the civilian quickly pulled a large piece of wood with his hand, but another piece of wood could not be pulled, so it fell. The official ordered the debate to begin.

<p>丨丨 Reply to Mr. Zhang Yiyan 丨丨</p>
<p>The second question also reveals Mr. Zhang's inclination towards a formalistic view. One should consider personal life prospects and those of the masses as an integrated whole. A person with lofty ideals would never abandon practical life to merely dream about "ideals." Having "ideals" doesn't mean discarding the "mundane"; on the contrary, ideals can only be realized through reality. Many people, seeing that reality isn't as bright as their ideals, try to escape it. Such people not only fail to realize their ideals but end up compromising with reality, or else they're left with mere fantasies. During the Xinhai Revolution, some people thought that engaging in revolution was equivalent to becoming a monk, and that having a job meant you couldn't simultaneously be revolutionary, or that you should first quit your job. But they still claimed revolution as their ideal. They formally separated revolution from practicalities. Of course, revolution requires organizers who must dedicate themselves to it, but such individuals should only comprise a small fraction of the revolution. The vast revolutionary masses are all simultaneously "scrambling for food" and striving for their ideals. The goals of personal survival and striving are inherently conflicting! Moreover, if one abandons reality to engage in empty talk about revolution, success may never come. The same applies to seeking knowledge. Vocational skills, literature, and social sciences can be learned according to one's actual life circumstances. We've recently discussed this in an article titled "Learning Theory and Learning Technology." Because Mr. Zhang separates life from ideals, he arrives at an abstract decision to "first pursue literature, then social sciences," completely disregarding vocational skills. By the time he's about to "starve," he "has to abandon literature or social sciences and focus on life-sustaining skills." Although this cannot be called a complete failure, it undoubtedly involves a formalistic logical error. Mr. Zhang fails to integrate the study of literature and social sciences into practical life. Why not study literature and social sciences while also learning life skills? Why not maintain one's basic living while striving for one's ideals? These things are not absolutely opposed to each other; one makes them absolute.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang also says, "I must try my best to squeeze into the ranks of the masses, but first I need to temper my muscles and bones and train my knowledge." While this seems correct in general, it's still a fantasy. We don't temper our muscles and bones first before joining the ranks of the masses, nor do we prepare our knowledge well before entering the world to work. We can only temper our muscles and bones in the life of the masses, and only in practice can we gain true knowledge. To resist Japan, we can do so anytime, anywhere, in any profession. It's not necessary to quit our jobs and run to the Northeast to resist Japan. Studying why Japan wants to invade China first before resisting Japan – this viewpoint, if not sly, deliberately deceptive, is simply too naive.</p>
<p>If that's the case, we naturally strive to lower the standard of our private lives and advance towards the path of ideals. Naturally, this process is a continuous battle, achieving our goals step by step with difficulty and hardship. How can personal demands be unmet to the point of "hindering our future and undermining our will"?</p>
<p>As for the third question raised by Mr. Zhang, saying that he "cannot bear the different stimuli, making him uneasy at work," and getting red in the face after seeing "a young man who committed suicide due to economic oppression," this is entirely driven by emotions. While we cannot "turn a deaf ear" to such things, it's not something to be dismissed with a fit of anger. These stimuli should only make us understand reality more clearly; how can they hinder the progress of young people?</p>
<p>In summary: We believe Mr. Zhang's attitude is very sincere and straightforward, worthy of special respect. But Mr. Zhang, like us, is still someone who has enough to eat, so all his views inevitably carry the atmosphere of our somewhat middle-class lives. In reality, there is no road in the world; roads are opened up by people. How to strive can only be suggested in principle and method by others; how to walk it depends entirely on your life practice. We have said this repeatedly 丨. We hope Mr. Zhang reads this letter while also reviewing previous articles, to quickly overcome his depression and find the path to strive.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he jumped out of the car. Two porters immediately came forward to carry his luggage. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li followed him in and saw a two-story courtyard house. Below the building, there were several brick rooms, while the upper floor was entirely made of wooden pillars and wooden walls. When people walked on the upper floor, the floorboards and walls vibrated with a "dong dong" sound. According to the porters, they would move their luggage to the two rooms downstairs. Li Shilian shook his head repeatedly, saying: "This is not good." The porter said: "Then, let's move it to the bungalows in the backyard, but the price will be a bit higher." Zhang Jiefu said: "Five dollars a day?" The porter smiled and said: "Not that much, a dollar and some cents is enough." Zhang Jiefu said: "A dollar and some cents, what's the big deal?" The porter, hearing this and seeing their situation, realized that they were clearly political figures, perhaps truly not caring about the money, so he carried their luggage and led them to the backyard. In this courtyard, there was a row of bungalows built with brick walls, with two rectangular glass windows in the front and back, and a half-glass door. This could barely be considered a Western-style house. Li Shilian first stretched his head to look at the hotel rules hanging on the wooden wall. The room rate was one dollar and twenty cents. He immediately planned in his mind that he would stay here for at least a month. For a long-term stay, if not a 30% discount, perhaps an 80% discount could be obtained, one times seven is seven, two times seven is one dime and four cents, adding up to just ninety-four cents. Looking at the room, there was a black wooden table, two chairs, two square stools, and an iron bed that was 70% new. Relatively speaking, it was still acceptable for settling down, so he told the porter to settle the luggage and shared a room with Zhang Jiefu. Because he had already checked in, the first thing the porter did was to bring a blue cloth duster. Li Shilian initially did not know what it was for until he saw Zhang Jiefu standing in the courtyard using the duster to dust off the dirt from his body, then he understood. Indeed, in this northwestern region, the first thing to do upon entering is to dust off the dirt. (9)</p>
<h3 id="e221">Fortress Against the Wokou <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>In the thirty-third year of the Jiajing reign (Emperor Shizong) of the Ming Dynasty, the Wokou (Japanese pirates) invaded the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, committing adultery, murder, and plunder. The people of our Zhejiang and Jiangsu suffered greatly at the hands of the Wokou. Their aim in disturbing our country was akin to piracy, without the ambitions of the Japanese of today. By the forty-second year of Jiajing, the Wokou had captured Pinghai, but Qi Jiguang defeated them, and eventually the pirates were pacified.</p>
<p>Qi Jiguang was a meritorious official who suppressed the Wokou; this is known to all. However, at that time, there were many people who killed Wokou in various places. Tongzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo, and other places also raised soldiers to resist alongside the government troops. Because the people felt the impact of this menace, they could not rely entirely on the government. Many fortresses still exist in various places as memorials to the resistance against the Wokou.</p>
<p>Like the Guanhaiwei of Cixi, a small city. Song'ao of Fenghua, bordered the Jiashan Port to the south, so there was also a fortress. At the foot of the White Pagoda Bridge in Mudu, Suzhou, there was an enemy watchtower, thirteen zhang wide and thirty-six chi high. The tower base was made of white stone, and the walls on all sides were built of bricks with various patterns. There were many small holes used for shooting bullets. The surroundings of the tower were picturesque, and the scenery was very beautiful, said to be one of the ten scenic spots of Mudu; it is unknown how many Wokou were killed there at the time.</p>
<p>Originally, at this time, the Wokou harassed from Fengqiao to Mudu, Xishan, and other places, burning, looting, and plundering along the way, committing all kinds of atrocities. Military commissioner Ren Huan and General Tang Kewan led troops to attack and suppress them. The Wokou fled into Taihu Lake, disturbing the east and west Dongting. Later, they disturbed Lingyan. Ren Huan led troops to catch up, killing many bandits under this enemy watchtower. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is using the "fortress policy" in Jiangxi to suppress the communists, which has yielded great results. I wonder what good methods we will have in the future to resist foreign insults? We, as ordinary people, should also "prepare for a rainy day"!</p>

<h3 id="e223">Old Tales of Conscription <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The other day, I read Mr. Rong Yu's "Song of Joining the Army," which contained the line, "But those conscripts had very short lives, because they looked down on the corruption of the Green Standard Army, and the Green Standard soldiers couldn't stand their arrogance. Stationed in the same place, they often engaged in械斗 (xiè dòu, armed brawls) over trivial matters. The court at that time ultimately did not like the new style, so it disbanded them," which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. I, Choucheng, was one of the conscripts at the time, and know the details more clearly. I will now recount the situation as follows:</p>
<p>In the spring of the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign, Jiangsu implemented conscription, recruiting more than 1,500 people from the three prefectures of Su, Song, and Tai. After arriving in Su, because the barracks across the river from Xiyuan were not completed, the teams were stationed in old barracks and temples inside and outside the city, organized into the First, Second, and Third Battalions according to the three prefectures of Su, Song, and Tai, called the Second Standard of the Jiangsu Army. The Green Standard Army north of Baodai Bridge was called the First Standard. (The barracks of that Standard were demolished during the "128 Incident" [Shanghai War of 1932] to rebuild an airfield.) I belonged to the First Platoon of the First Battalion of the Second Standard, serving as the deputy head of the eighth squad (initially there were no squad heads), in charge of fourteen people, stationed in the Lao Lang Temple in front of the Zhenfu Envoy's Office. At that time, those who were conscripted from the three prefectures had varying levels of education. There were scholars who had entered schools, students who were in school,纨绔子弟 (wánkù zǐdì, spoiled rich kids), and hoodlums. Wearing yellow cloth uniforms, they swaggered through the streets, local hoodlums avoided them, and donkey cart drivers treated them like gods, calling them "Conscript Lords." After dinner, the platoon leader and officers led the team on long-distance marches in the streets and alleys, all singing the military songs "Advance, advance!" and "The brave men of the world contend for merit," along the way residents supported the old and led the young, leaning on their doors to watch. The First Standard Green Standard Army still had black cloth wrapped around their heads, wearing numbered gowns, and had to hold a three-foot-long numbered sign when going out. Comparing the two, there was indeed a world of difference. The governor of the time, Chen Kuilong, accompanied by the three chief officers of the Training Office, often gathered the conscripts to give speeches, so they all knew to pay attention to military discipline. One day, someone in the Third Battalion of the Second Standard encountered soldiers of the First Standard outside the Yang Bridge at the Daxu Gate, holding numbered signs and flirting with prostitutes on the road, believing that it was disrupting military discipline, and stepped forward to stop them. They were looking for trouble because the superiors were treating the First and Second Standards unequally, so they took this opportunity to return to the barracks to incite trouble, went out in groups to pick a fight with the conscripts, and beat anyone they encountered. Eventually, two people were robbed and beaten to death outside Fengmen. Later, two ringleaders were captured from the First Standard, executed at Wang Fei Ji to avenge the drowned. What Mr. Rong Yu called械斗 (xiè dòu, armed brawls) probably refers to this incident. After entering the barracks in the winter of that year, management became stricter. About 70% of the people from the three prefectures deserted because life was too hard. The authorities had no way to solve this problem, so they recruited people from the Xuzhou, Huaizhou, and Haizhou areas to fill the vacancies. At that time, I had already been admitted to the Army Attached School. Three years later, when the conscripts were discharged, there were only about a hundred people left, so what Mr. Rong Yu called disbanding is not accurate. I am afraid that the matter has been forgotten for a long time, so I specially make it public.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Misty Record of Imperial Fragrance <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The duties of the Imperial Guards were not easy! Although their task was to protect, patrol, and guard, their actions had to be very careful. First, they could not talk and laugh loudly, and second, they could not make too much noise while walking, otherwise they would inevitably face the danger of having their heads chopped off at any time. Therefore, after the Empress Dowager rested, the surroundings were as silent as death. Although we could vaguely see the lights of village homes in the distance flickering on the horizon through the car windows, no human voice was heard, not even the barking of dogs or the chirping of insects. The air was filled with a solemn and cold atmosphere, like ice. Under this rare atmosphere, our Empress Dowager spent a very comfortable night.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Empress Dowager got up. She usually got up very early, and now that she was on the train, her spirit was even more excited, and she got up especially early. After getting up, she quickly washed and dressed, and then hurriedly ordered the train to start. Thus, this yellow train set off in the faint morning light. Not long after the train started, it suddenly began to rain, but not heavily, just a very fine drizzle. If we were walking in this rain, even without an umbrella, our clothes would definitely not be soaked; at most, they would feel slightly damp. This kind of drizzle is most common in spring, often falling several times a day, probably due to the season?</p>
<p>This season is "Qingming" (Tomb-Sweeping Day). The saying, "During Qingming, the rain falls in torrents," is truly a most accurate descriptive poem. Every Qingming Festival, we descendants must bring wine, food, paper money, etc., and respectfully go to our ancestors' graves to perform the tomb-sweeping ceremony. This is a custom that is common everywhere in China. Therefore, when our train passed through the wilderness, we saw countless people along the way, braving the rain, worshiping at their ancestral graves. They were all very far away from the railway!

<p>Can such a broken umbrella cope with the coming storm?</p>

<p>— (Yang Yusheng)</p>
<p>Mosquitoes in the twentieth century are truly cunning! In the past, people only knew that mosquitoes could fly, but now they have evolved to be able to climb!</p>
<p>In the deep recesses of the bed curtains, they can creep in, lying on the less sensitive parts of the human body, sucking blood. These are the top-notch characters!</p>
<p>Secondly, although their creeping skills are lacking and difficult to make them intimate companions, their senses are very keen. They know the head and foot positions of the target object in the tent, lurking outside and waiting. The head or feet cannot be said to have no contact with the bed curtains, so their bellies are often full!</p>
<p>Although the skills of the top-notch characters are high, the dangers they face are also great; this is in line with the old saying "The higher you climb, the harder you fall." When the target object wakes up, sees many transparent, blood-colored "balloons" staying on the top of the tent, the concept of revenge is aroused, and he immediately sentences them to the extreme penalty of "exterminating their clan." At this time, each of them dragging a "saturated" belly, loses their spirit of flying and climbing, and ends up in a crushed and broken end!</p>
<p>Where I've Travelled</p>
<h3 id="e226">Summer at Yellow Crane Tower <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>Like floating clouds, five years have passed so imperceptibly, but every summer, I think of Yellow Crane Tower.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Yellow Crane Tower itself, those who have visited it all know that it is not as beautiful as one imagines, but since it has become a famous scenic spot, it cannot be without merit. So when our ship arrived in Hankou two hours later, I made a pilgrimage to this medieval relic. At this time, although I did not have the elegant sentiments of the ancients who climbed to a high place to compose poems, I was extremely emotional at the moment of leaning on the railing and looking down, and what was even more pleasant was that I decided to spend the summer at Yellow Crane Tower. Of course, this cannot be as simple as officials and celebrities going to Mogan Mountain or Qingdao, and there are naturally various inevitable reasons mixed in. It is not that I have that extra money, nor that I have such a leisurely time, but it is a long story, and it is off-topic, so let's put it aside for now.</p>
<p>So I said, that summer I lived on the Yellow Crane Tower. After getting up early in the morning, I walked past that famous Goose Character Stele. When I walked past it for the first time, I didn't feel how powerful this goose character was written. I only felt that Wang Xizhi was really joking. Fortune-telling halls and photo studios are even more special products of the Yellow Crane Tower. Generally, Chinese people are so rich in poetic sentiment that after applying their names to the scenic spot, they also sigh that the scenic spot is hard to revisit, and they need to leave a photo of a hermit under the flowers. Therefore, in order to adapt to this need, more than twenty or thirty photo studios have opened on the ridges and slopes of the small Yellow Crane Tower, which can also be said to be ah, flourishing. Speaking of the fortune-telling halls, there are even more horizontal plaques askew, calligraphy and paintings all over the walls, bright windows and clean tables. The self-proclaimed hermit sits in the middle, waiting for someone to send money to dissolve misfortunes. There is also a park behind the Yellow Crane Tower. The cement railings in the memorial hall in the park have not been repaired. I think the reason for this lack of repair is probably the same as that of an old bronze teapot. I remember that there was a legend about someone who played antiques and bought a bronze stove from the Tang Dynasty in the market one day. He happily invited relatives and friends to appreciate it together. Who knew that a woman said that she did not know the goods, saying that the bronze stove was dirty and crooked, and there was nothing good about it, but the owner heavily declared that the good thing was that it was dirty, and if it were not dirty, would it be an antique? The valuable thing is this bit of dirt. Naturally, the woman would retort that the dung board is also very dirty... However, I dare not say more here. What I want to say is that the decline of the memorial hall is probably the reason why it is a famous scenic spot.</p>
<p>The room I lived in was rented to me by a famous photo studio, upstairs. Looking out the window, you can see a panoramic view of Wuchang, and turning your neck, you can also see Hankou emitting black smoke, as well as the large and small ships moving in the river. But I am really afraid of doing this, because when I look down, the streets are full of hot sun, and hurried pedestrians walking in the sun. I really don't understand, I don't understand why life is always so busy? And I don't know what people are so busy with?</p>
<p>The tourists on the Yellow Crane Tower are almost endless from morning to night, but the men or women who are parasitic on this scenic spot also exist at all times. Beggars with broken legs cry and bump their heads on the ground, kiln girls with too much powder always use that disguised method of pulling people, dealing with tourists like soldiers dealing with villagers, and photographers are even more competing with each other, only the fortune tellers are leisurely, but who can guarantee that he is not worried about life and his intestines are tangled and his eyes are piercing?</p>
<p>Scenic spot, scenic spot!</p>
<p>There is no clean land in this world.</p>

<p>Eleventh Annual Meeting Record</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<h3 id="e231">Shao Yuanchong's Speech <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Following Shao Yuanchong's speech, "Economic Control and Ability Control," he stated that the issue of economic control is a significant problem in China today, amidst internal strife, external threats, and the destruction of the rural economy. Therefore, the general theme of the annual conference is "Discussion on the Implementation of Economic Control Policies in China." Now, he would like to expand on this topic, namely, economic control and ability control. At first glance, these seem to be two separate concepts, but they are actually complementary. When discussing the meaning of economic control, it refers to the national economy and the people's economy. In reality, a certain plan is needed, such as the government running enterprises alongside the people running enterprises. This is the inevitable path to developing a country's economy and advancing human society. Ancient economics were tribal, and the economic conditions of social organizations were extremely simple. As times progressed, economies entered a state of competition, adopting competitive strategies. In this process, the small were no match for the large, and the unorganized were no match for the organized. Therefore, the small and unorganized gradually disappeared. In modern times, economic power has expanded even further. In addition to its own development, it can also manipulate politics, diplomacy, international trade, etc. Therefore, the political power of the United States does not reside in Washington but in the New York banking community. They can use their monopolistic economic power to influence politics. That's why Europeans are reluctant to engage in politics and prefer to engage in economics. In the past, when he visited the United States, he found that the organization of economic groups was extremely rigorous and extensive. For example, they have consultants on transportation laws, etc., which greatly help in reducing transportation costs and various legal matters. Even in congressional elections, the group pays close attention to the investigation of candidates, providing economic assistance to those who, after being elected, can help the group's economic activities and standpoints, so as to ensure their election, or else undermine them. From this, it can be seen that economic power has a significant impact on politics. In addition, powerful economic groups can grasp finance, currency, and the market, making them suitable for the various economic needs of the people. Therefore, economic control, which is related to people's lives, is guided and assisted by the government. In many European countries, related enterprises are all controlled and regulated by the government, so that these countries can achieve prosperity and strength. In China's recent situation, economic control is particularly urgent. For example, various raw materials for national defense and commodity raw materials are shipped abroad at cheap prices. Due to the failure to control agricultural products economically, the suffering and impact on the people are enormous. Regarding these issues, we, from the standpoint of scholars, study whether a controlled economic plan can be implemented and achieved. Otherwise, the plan is equal to zero. From this, a second question arises, namely, that while the economy needs to be controlled, people's abilities should also be controlled. Therefore, the advancement of a certain undertaking must require certain people with the necessary knowledge and conditions before it can proceed smoothly. Conversely, even if there is a plan but no capable talent, how can one expect to achieve the desired results? Knowing the methods to solve problems and being able to implement them is ability. Using a small amount of effort to achieve great results, using few methods to do more work and achieve greater results, this is what is called ability. For example, person A studies politics, person B studies economics, and person C studies engineering. If their respective fields of study are mutually transferred to handle unknown undertakings, then the results will definitely be nil. If they are assigned according to their studies, then they will surely be able to demonstrate their abilities. For example, if he does not understand a certain undertaking, he should first study it with time, so that he can understand it before taking on the task. If so, then time is wasted, and the wheel of time keeps moving forward. By the time he finishes learning, time has passed, and what he has learned is not useful. Doing things in this way consumes a lot of energy and yields very little results. Therefore, to solve the problem of people's livelihood through economic control, one should also consider the expression of people's abilities. Great talents should be used to do great undertakings, and small talents should be used to do small undertakings. In this way, all kinds of people can use their abilities. Time is not wasted, and the result of joint efforts will be very grand. Therefore, when talking about ability control, (1) emphasis should be placed on education and training, which can be divided into higher and ordinary. Ordinary people should be made to serve in ordinary undertakings, while higher talents should be made to handle higher undertakings and pay more attention to basic factual training. For example, in the social aspect, statistics must be implemented, so that one can know the location of higher and ordinary talents at home and abroad, and use them at any time to exert their abilities. (2) The problem of ability distribution: when talents and undertakings are both available, distribution is extremely important. For example, if specialists and ordinary people are distributed according to their abilities, then at least their abilities can be fully utilized in their undertakings. The above principles, when applied to economic control, are not only not contradictory but also complement each other. Therefore, in terms of land and labor, land belongs to the economy, and labor belongs to ability. This meaning can be expressed mutually. The controlled economic plan set by the British Liberal Party in 1928, such as industrial control and financial control, belongs to the economic aspect, while labor control belongs to ability. Therefore, economic control not only involves itself but also requires consideration of all aspects, so that all people in the country can use their abilities on a large scale and in a wide range to do what they can do, without wasting their labor, energy, and time. If one day is devoted to doing one thing with one's ability, then the results of that thing will be great. If one day is devoted to doing several things, then one's ability will be insufficient, and the results will be minimal. Proceeding according to the above questions, the solution to the problem of economic control can be expected to be realized, and doing things in this way should also achieve very good results, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Hu Shuhua's Speech　Lastly, the chairman invited Hu Shuhua, the president of Hunan University <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>to speak. Hu, due to time constraints, gave a brief speech, saying that there is a wonderful mutual assistance between academic groups and academic institutions, and the beauty of complementing each other. The natural disasters and man-made disasters that our country has suffered in recent decades have caused the economic environment to fall into a state of stagnation. Sun Yat-sen said, "People's livelihood is the center of social evolution." How to make society evolve and how to develop people's livelihood is a heavy responsibility for all of you. This time, your society has taken "Discussion on the Implementation of Economic Control Policies in China" as the topic, which shows great insight.

<p>Letter to the Education Expense Committee</p>
<p>Revised Regulations for Handling Tooth Tax and Slaughter Tax and Bidding Regulations</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education, Funds Management Office, for the purpose of revising the tooth tax handling regulations and bidding regulations, and the slaughter tax implementation rules and bidding regulations, sent a letter to the Jiangsu Education Funds Committee for record. The original letter briefly stated that the tooth tax should be handled by inviting merchants to contract, in accordance with the slaughter tax method. The previously drafted handling regulations and bidding regulations were sent to your meeting for deliberation and approval. However, the previously set bidding date was based on the fiscal year, uniformly stipulated as June 15th. It has now been changed to bidding at any time. The financial bureaus of various counties have long been abolished, and the two-thousandth revenue section of the Finance Department has been replaced by this office to collect and remit the funds. All of these have changed, and there is a need for revision. In addition, merchants with excellent performance in handling the tax are allowed to continue for another year to become proficient. Tooth tax and slaughter tax have been handled in this way for many years and have been quite effective, and should also be included in the regulations so that there is a basis. Therefore, the tooth tax handling regulations and bidding regulations, together with the slaughter tax implementation rules and bidding regulations, have been revised accordingly and sent to your committee for inspection and record.</p>

<p>Because the existing offices of the Ministry of Education are insufficient, and social institutions such as the General Association of the Boy Scouts of China and the National Academic Work Consultation Office also need to be allocated some housing, it is necessary to add official residences. Previously, the Ministry had appointed members to form a committee to plan the construction. Now that the review of all procedures is complete, it has been decided to start bidding on September 1st, and construction will begin after the bidding is opened on the 15th. A new foundation of 59 square zhang has been purchased, and a Western-style building of about 20 rooms will be built. It is said that in the future, the offices of the vice ministers, secretaries, counselors, commissioners, supervisors, and conference rooms will all be moved into the new building.</p>

<p>Standards for Science Equipment in Secondary Schools</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Relays Orders to Secondary Schools to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all secondary schools in the city, stating: It has been received from the Ministry of Education's Order No. 8083 that, according to the statistics of the graduation examinations of secondary school students in various provinces and cities in recent years, the academic performance of science teaching in various secondary schools is relatively poor. The Ministry has already informed and ordered improvements to be made. The improvement of science equipment is closely related to the improvement of science teaching. There has been no uniform standard for the preparation of science instruments and medicines in various secondary schools. The organizers often have no basis to follow, and it is difficult for educational administrative agencies to assess. Therefore, the Ministry has specifically ordered the Committee for the Compilation of Curricula and Equipment Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools to develop science equipment standards for secondary schools. The currently compiled standards include secondary school physics equipment standards and secondary school chemistry equipment standards. The standards include detailed explanations and thorough regulations on the equipment for student experiments in chemistry and physics at the high school level, such as lists of instruments and medicines, demonstration experiment equipment, factory equipment, and attached drawings. In addition, there are minimum equipment standards, ordinary equipment standards, and complete equipment standards, as well as estimates of the value of instruments and medicines, so that each secondary school can purchase them separately according to its economic capacity and gradually improve and enrich them. After the implementation of these standards, not only should each secondary school comply with the equipment matters, but also the educational administrative agencies, supervisors, or specialist inspectors of each province and city should use this as a basis in actual inspections. Each bureau should also follow these standards to improve the science equipment of its subordinate secondary schools to enhance teaching effectiveness and improve student levels. In addition to being announced by the Ministry, the bureaus should also be ordered to inspect and distribute 20 copies of each of the standards. The order is issued so that you are aware of the contents of the order, and one copy of each of the secondary school physics and chemistry equipment standards is enclosed for reference.</p>

<p>September 15th</p>
<p>The registration for the first Siming University Scholarship, which began on the 13th of this month and ended on the 26th, saw an enthusiastic response from Ningbo students. It was reported in this newspaper that a total of 172 people registered for this year's scholarship, 86 of whom were admitted to universities, 78 were already studying at universities, and 8 planned to enter graduate schools. The registration procedures were completed as scheduled on the 26th. The review group of the committee held a meeting on the 29th at the Ningbo Association, 3rd floor. Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Shenzhi, Wei Bozhen, Wu Yeqin, Li Gufan, Zheng Chengqing, and Chen Zhongci attended. The meeting was chaired by Wei Bozhen and recorded by Zhang Lianquan. The following resolutions were passed: (1) A motion to urge the submission of supporting documents within a limited time. It was resolved that the deadline for submitting documents is September 10 for those admitted to universities and graduate schools, and September 5 for those continuing to study at universities. Those who fail to submit the documents after the deadline will have their registration canceled. (2) A motion to request a date for the announcement of the review results and the awarding of scholarships. It was resolved that the review results will be announced on September 15, and the awarding of scholarships will begin on September 16. (3) A motion to add review committee members. It was resolved to recommend Zhang Shouyong, Hu Xian, and Hu Mengjia as members of the review group. In addition, it is reported that the association is now actively urging the submission of supporting documents in order to prepare for the scheduled meeting for review. For those who have graduated from secondary school and plan to enter university, due to the fact that the admission dates of various universities sometimes fall in early September, it is not possible to be lenient in terms of time. For those who continue to study at university, they only need to submit their transcripts from the previous semester, which is very simple, and the schools have already sent the transcripts to their parents after the summer vacation, so there is no need to wait. Therefore, it is stipulated that all documents must be submitted before the 5th of next month, and no documents will be accepted after the deadline, in order to show the restrictions.</p>

<p>丨Lecture at the 4th Shanghai Summer Lecture School丨</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Distinguished guests, I am very pleased to be here today at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to give a lecture. The weather today is too hot, and I don't want to waste your time with unnecessary words. The topic I want to talk about today is "The Problem of Civic Education in National Revival."</p>
<p>There are probably several motivations for me to talk about this topic. First, you are all people engaged in education, and the purpose of this school is specifically to study various educational issues. I lack specialized research in pedagogy, so I dare not talk too much about educational issues. However, I am a person who studies political science, and everyone knows that political science and education cannot be completely separated, especially the issue of civic education, which has a deeper relationship with political science. Secondly, I have a very important reason, which is that in recent years, whether in lectures or writing, I have had a central idea, which is nationalism. Therefore, I dare to say that at least I myself must believe that I am a thorough and ardent believer in nationalism. Therefore, I feel that the issue of civic education in national revival is very important, so I take this opportunity to contribute some opinions to everyone. Furthermore, I remember that I gave a very simple talk on the essentials of civic education at the Public Education Center last week. At that time, due to time constraints, I did not have time to elaborate. I have long wanted to supplement it. Today I have the opportunity to study it with everyone in more detail, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>1. The Importance of Civic Education</p>
<p>I feel that the most important driving force for the survival of a nation is its citizens. According to the principles of political science, the composition of a country has three elements: one is territory, one is sovereignty, and one is the people. And I believe that the most important of these three elements is the people. Because territory and sovereignty must be maintained and protected by the people. If there are no people, or even if there are people, but the people do not have sound strength, then the so-called territory and sovereignty will inevitably exist in name only. Therefore, the people can be said to be the only element of a country.</p>
<p>So, how can we truly make the people the only element of a country? This requires us, who are responsible for education, to train them. Then they can truly have a relationship with the country. The Chinese nation has reached an unprecedentedly dangerous and difficult period at this stage. During this extremely dangerous and difficult period, there are certainly many ways to save the country, but the most important and fundamental thing is to rely on the people who are the only element of our country. However, can the Chinese people now have a close relationship with the country? Can they have the strength to maintain the territory and protect sovereignty? And do they have the courage and sense of responsibility to maintain the territory and protect sovereignty? These are all extremely serious problems that urgently need to be remedied.</p>
<p>Superficially, the Chinese people are numerous, with as many as 400 million. No other country in the world can compare with China. Logically speaking, having so many people should generate tremendous power. But in fact, it is not so. China is a country without power in the world. Take Belgium, for example. It is one of the smallest countries in the world. Its territory is only about the size of a few counties in China, but it was able to resist its powerful neighbor during the European War, the most powerful army in the world, Germany, which is enough to prove that although the country is small, its power is very strong. China has always been known to the world for its vast land, abundant resources, and large population. Why is it powerless? Why is it so declining and facing such a serious national crisis? I am the least fond of flattering others, and I am also the least willing to belittle my own nation. Someone from a certain country, I will not name him for the time being, said something that neither hurts nor itches us. He said that although China has 400 million people, it is impossible to find a sound citizen like those in Europe, America, or Japan among these 400 million people. These words are certainly too contemptuous of us, belittling us, and insulting us, but if we humbly reflect on it, we should also be deeply vigilant. It is undeniable that there are very few people in our country who possess the qualifications of sound citizens. It is precisely because there are not many truly sound citizens in China that the country cannot generate power, and the spirit of the nation is also declining day by day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important plan for saving the country in the future is to start with training citizens, training citizens to make each of them generate power, and striving for the country, so that each of them has a close relationship with the country, and condenses with the country. In this way, 400 million people will have the power of 400 million people. Otherwise, the people will have nothing to do with the country, and the people will not know that there is a country in their minds. Not only will they not know how to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens to the country, but they will also hinder the survival of the country and overflow the rights and interests of the nation. This kind of person who has nothing to do with the country and even hinders the survival of the nation cannot be regarded as a citizen of the country, and cannot generate power for the country. Therefore, if we want to save the country, we must first train all 400 million people in the country to become citizens, which requires promoting and popularizing civic education. In the simplest terms, civic education is to educate the people to know how to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens to the country, so that the people and the country become one. In this way, one citizen can generate the power of one citizen, and the power of 400 million people can be gathered into a most powerful force. With this great power, we can solve the unprecedented national crisis and create a new life for the nation.</p>

<p>$50,000 Reward</p>
<p>Unwilling to Become a Professional Player</p>
<p>Tilden Company Disappointed</p>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 29th) Wilbur Two-Den, the American and Australian tennis champion holder, British tennis master Panley today rejected Two-Den's professional tennis player group manager Uberlin's reward of 50,000 yuan, making him a professional tennis player. Panley published two reasons for his rejection: (1) At least half of his income must be paid in taxes, so the income is very small; (2) He will be excluded by any British tennis club.</p>
<p>After Panley won the U.S. Open singles title last year, he is now actively preparing to keep it. Before leaving England, he had a conversation with a Reuters reporter as follows:</p>
<p>"Others seem to be more interested in my marriage than I am in winning the tennis championship (Pan recently got engaged to actress Lawson). I will be away from home for eight months. Mr. Whirter, who is traveling with me, is my deputy captain and deputy manager. The two of us form this tennis team. After the U.S. Open, we will go to California to meet Miss Longte and go to Australia together."</p>
<p>Panley must return to England as early as March next year. After the U.S. Open, he will travel to Hualanwu, San Francisco, and New Zealand, and then to Australia. When asked about his wedding date, he smiled and did not answer.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Finance Inflationary Sentiment Re-emerges <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Standard Gold Recovers after Excitement, then Weakens Again</p>
<p>Fewer Chips, Strong Shorts, Another Half-Dollar Increase</p>
<p>The gold market is quite strong with the inflationary sentiment from the U.S. side, then rises and falls, and the people's hearts continue to be tired. The situation is ultimately difficult to last. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in Britain and the United States was flat, and London raw gold rose by three pennies, so the exchange rate was miserably low. American wheat rose by one point one two five, American cotton rose by one pound sound, and American stocks rose and fell slightly. According to reports, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's wireless speech is considered to be the prelude to a major expansion. This is the telegram from the day before yesterday, which has been recorded in the market conditions of the day before yesterday. It has no great influence on the general trend over time. Therefore, when the goods were opened, they rose to a strong 59 yuan. People's hearts are still difficult to be optimistic, and sellers are active when they see high prices, and the downstream is good. Because under the British massive expansion, the price of the first order has fallen, and the large strips are difficult to shrink. Moreover, the United States, which advocates currency inflation, will inevitably rise up to resist, and will never allow the miserable fall in the exchange rate. The gold industry's reserve transaction is about eight yuan. After the opening, the banks tend to be blocked, and the exchange market steps hard. The market is frustrated as soon as it opens. There are still buyers at low prices. It is expected that HSBC's listing of the British flat and the American shrink two five. In addition, the Reuters telegram said that U.S. President Roosevelt did not seem to have any immediate expansion proposals. He said that the government's last strategy was to adopt the reduction of the value of the U.S. dollar and obtain the benefits of gold. Although it lacks much influence, the hearts of the people are properly shaken, and the internal market is also tight. The price of gold then rose. After entering, it was stable for a long time. In the end, the Guangdong gang had some sales, and the bank's appetite was sluggish, and the exchange market became hard again. At noon, it fell again. The subsequent market was stable as soon as it opened. However, due to the Mumbai telegram reporting an increase of 5.6.6 Anna, the selling wind immediately rose, but there was still a rebound. In the end, people's hearts were tragic and the rise was difficult to rise. The Mumbai second callback was two. Three. Three Anna, but because the Great American Evening News carried unfavorable news such as inflating the currency and raising the price of gold and silver, the sellers were still eager, and the market was tired again at the close. After the close, the decline continued. In one day, it was firm first and then tired. The supply exceeded the demand, and the rise was difficult to shake. It was really because there were not many chips, and the short sellers still had the strength. Now I will record the market conditions for one day,</p>
<p>The morning opening was 957 yuan and 70 cents, which was 2 yuan and 60 cents higher than the previous close. The opening of goods was at the same price. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of British exchange rate of one shilling four pence six eight seven five, U.S. exchange rate of 35 yuan one eight seven five, and then seven yuan eight cents. Hengyu Fuxing Yongyongfeng Ding Kang Yuansheng Yong Tongchun and others sold out. Magali came out with U.S. dollars for September two five, and October three one two five, and fell to six yuan two cents. Dafa Yongyu Qing Yong Yuanfeng Yongyongli Yuanmao Yongshun Maofu Yu Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Zhentai Yongde Hengyu and others continued to buy, and the internal market was slightly tight. Although Yicheng Qian Changxiang Futai Xiang sold, in the end, it was expected that HSBC's listing of the British flat and the American shrink two five. It rose to eight yuan eight cents. Huabi sold U.S. dollars for October two five, Fuyu Yixian Feng Yong Qingyu Hongxing Dafa Yongyongli took the opportunity to sell, and retreated to seven yuan and a half. At this time, Yuanmao Yong Run Chang Yu Chunyuan Yongshun Mao Zhaofeng Chang still had appetite, and it rose to eight yuan four cents again, and hovered around eight yuan for a long time. After that, the Guangdong gang supplied, and the U.S. dollar internal market became hard again. Mitsui sold U.S. dollars for November three seven five and December four three seven five. Dalian gang Dafa Yong Yuanxing Hengyu Fu An Hengtai Ding Kang Da Kang and others sold out one after another, gradually retreating to five yuan and a half. Yuan Yi Tongchun Yuanmao Yong Yu Qingyong took the opportunity to collect the strips at a low price, and gradually rebounded to six yuan eight cents. Qing Fayong Yuanchun still had supply, and it was reduced to six yuan. Fuyu maintained the drop, and it was about to be settled, and the noon closing was 956 yuan. The goods were auctioned at the same price.</p>

Shunmao Tianfeng Fuyu Yuanchun Yuanmao Yong all entered, and rose to 7 yuan and 10 cents.

It was found that the highest price of the day was 558 yuan and 80 cents, and the lowest price was 954 yuan and 30 cents. There were four yuan and a half ups and downs. As a result, it fell another half yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was that HSBC Bank's U.S. exchange rate listing was reduced by two five, which was 34 yuan and 625 yuan, and the combined standard gold price was 999 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 44 yuan and a few cents, which was less than 8 yuan more than the previous closing. The September registration was 958 yuan, October was 956 yuan, the morning water supplement was 958 yuan, the afternoon water supplement was 957 yuan, and the red gold price was still increased by 12 yuan, and the listing was 969 yuan and 70 cents. The in-house transactions were uncertain. It also manages huge transactions. The customers are still digging for future settlements, all of which are done by Yingfeng Hengsuo. It is estimated that the Tianjin gang appeared spot goods according to the increase of 13 yuan, and the future goods increased by 14 yuan and a half, totaling about 300 taels. Substandard goods have arrived, about less than 12 yuan. It is heard that Hengyu gave Yingfeng Heng a 140-strip subsidy for the swap, which turned out to be a flat swap. The Central Bank had Yingfeng Heng open 175 spot goods at a price of 956 yuan. There were 2,170 September strips left, a total of 10 long positions and 9 short positions. There were not many in-house transactions, and the seller's arrogance was still strong.

After the opening, it was slightly loose, and the bank's appetite tended to be blocked and loose. However, because HSBC Bank's listing was announced, the British flat and the American shrank two five, and the bank dug up long-term, it once tended to be tight. In the end, the people's hearts were not shaken, and Chinese businessmen such as the Guangdong gang had some supply, and the bank's appetite was normal, and it tended to be loose again. The trend became hard at noon, and the post-market was flat. However, due to the Mumbai increase of 5.6.6 Anna, the Guangdong gang sold again, and it changed from tight to loose, and the trend was difficult to shake. Therefore, the Mumbai second callback was small by two. Three. Three Anna, there was still a lack of change.

The appetites of Chinese businessmen varied, and the digging and blocking were very frequent.

<p>丨Foreign Use Turns Prosperous, and the Allocation Head Suddenly Increases by Six Points丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, because there was only one day left until the end of the big month, the silver money industry had to make a conclusion as usual. The market atmosphere was bound to improve compared to usual. This time, because the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching from the old tradition, the silver root and foreign use were even more tense. It is expected that the silver money industry will have new developments at this moment. Yesterday, although the foreign demolition market price was still one jiao, morning and noon were the same, and the allocation head added water, because the foreign use turned prosperous, and the demand exceeded the supply, causing a sudden increase of six points, which was estimated to be eight points, which also shows the eagerness of social needs. The demolition ticket transaction was also smoother than before. It is estimated that the transfer and new transaction in the early market was more than 4.2 million, more than 200,000 in the noon market, more than 400,000 in the small general meeting, and the number of foreign pawn transaction transactions also increased.

<p>Rumors Abound, Bond Market Plunges Again</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market saw another round of declines. All the gains from the 28th have been wiped out. Market rumors are once again taking the opportunity to rise, exaggerating and sensationalizing, as if a great building is about to collapse. Speaking calmly and rationally, the market price is indeed not looking good for the time being, but it shouldn't be the case that every time a decline starts, any slight recovery in market price is immediately suppressed. This is simply manipulation on the surface, for speculative purposes. Those who are unsure are inevitably crushed due to various threats and propaganda. In reality, the situation has not changed in these past few days, and the interbank lending rate has not fluctuated. Treating rumors as facts is no way to discuss government bonds. Observing market trends, it appears to be gradually consolidating, but the lack of confidence and the increasing number of short sellers indicate that any rebound will be significant. Yesterday, there were three trading sessions. The first session saw prices fall from high to low, with a clear downward trend. Prices generally fell, with some items dropping by around one and a half yuan. In the second session, the front-end continued to decline by two to four and a half jiao. Starting from the 20 series bonds, there was a slight recovery of three to four jiao, but it ultimately felt weak and lifeless. The closing price turned downward again, with the 20 series dropping almost one yuan. Despite the slight recovery in the second session, it was quickly followed by another sharp decline. Apart from the pressure from speculators, this is difficult to explain with ordinary reasoning. Trading mainly involved buying the 4th and 11th series. The final market prices showed declines ranging from five to six jiao to two yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 25 million yuan. Due to insufficient time for detailed analysis, the specifics are omitted. The results of the price fluctuations are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from Newchwang Foreign Firm, yesterday (29th), the New York stock market showed a mixed trend throughout the day due to bearish news. However, most stocks closed firm later on. The government's crackdown on privately-run distilleries strengthened the market. The situation on the small exchange was also mixed. The government bond market was volatile and directionless, but the strength of public utility and industrial bonds was still noteworthy. Due to the demand from flour mills and the Treasury Secretary Mellon's hinting at expansion, the Chicago grain market rose. The total trading volume was 760,000 shares.

<p>The August Gold Rooster brand yarn was listed on March 1st this year. The opening price for the first session was 181.6 yuan. At that time, due to disappointing spring sales, weak US cotton, pressure from foreign firms, and the huge inventory of over 100,000 bales of yarn in Shanghai, there was extreme panic and strong selling pressure. The lowest price reached around 172 yuan. Later, in mid-June and July, the factories found it difficult to sustain due to high original costs and increasing losses. A major factory, Fengchao, suffered the most. As a result, various factories, recognizing the unfavorable situation, suspended or reduced production, leading to a contraction in output. At the same time, yarn sales in South and North China began to recover, and the market sentiment gradually improved. Merchants from Tianjin, finding coarse yarn cheaper than Japanese yarn, purchased large quantities in Shanghai. More recently, the financial community profited greatly from flour and wheat, and also absorbed large quantities of branded yarn. The highest market price reached 187.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the market price rose, there were more sellers, and actual demand suddenly turned dull. Short sellers delivered 1,000 bales of new goods. The yarn inventory in the Shanghai market warehouse was still difficult to reduce, and the pressure from Japanese merchants intensified, breaking through the 80 yuan mark to a low of 179.8 yuan. As a result, out of the remaining 9,750 bales, 2,400 bales were actually delivered, including 2,150 bales of 20-count Ren Zhong brand, 50 bales of Jin Cheng brand, 100 bales of Shuang Lu brand, and 100 bales of Tian Guan brand. The delivery price was 181 yuan. The broker numbers and bale amounts of the delivering and receiving parties are listed below (unit: bales):</p>

<p>The August brand cotton was listed on March 1st this year. The opening price for the first session was 36 yuan. Later, due to the inability of US cotton to rise, the sluggish yarn market, and the gradual arrival of old cotton from various regions in Shanghai, Shanghai's cotton inventory increased. The factory's yarn sales were weak, and raw cotton intake was slow, so the market gradually declined. The lowest price reached 33.75 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the price fell, it triggered bullish activity, and a certain cotton firm absorbed large quantities. At the same time, yarn and cotton sales were very active, and the squeeze became more intense. The highest price reached 39.6 yuan. Buyers profited greatly and took the opportunity to close out positions, returning to mid-June and July. Factories saw increasing cuts in work and factory stoppages due to high cotton prices, the reduction in raw material demand was also greatly reduced, and the most recent delivery was adequate, market prices were forced to fall, and the final closing price was 34.5 yuan. As a result, out of the remaining 37,100 dan, only 2,100 dan were actually delivered, including Huoji cotton, Shaanxi cotton, Shashi cotton, Tianjin fine velvet cotton, and Lingbao cotton. The delivery price was 35 yuan. Most of the recipients were speculators, and very few were factories. The broker numbers and bale amounts of the delivering and receiving parties are listed below:</p>

<p>Fine Velvet Cotton is Good in Color, General Cotton is Excellent in Quality</p>
<p>Spot Yarn and Cotton Trading is Quiet and Sluggish</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and spot yarn sales are clear, but more than before. Large transactions by various groups are still lacking. Due to tight credit, banditry, and yarn sales being greatly affected, foreign cotton conditions are still stable. Yesterday, the spot yarn market was stagnant. The total purchase of the day by various groups was 435 bales. The market was down a small amount, from two and a half to five jiao. The purchase amount of various groups is as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Group 160　Changsha 80</p>
<p>Inland 95　Xiamen 25</p>
<p>Guangdong 65　Nanjing 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat and lifeless. The price of yarn is falling sharply, factory demand is halted, and the weather is dry this year. New cotton from various places is arriving earlier, and the quality is better. The fine velvet cotton has good color, the second batch of new general cotton has arrived in Shanghai sixty-two bales with quality is better than in previous years, and opened at thirty-nine yuan. After weighing at the dock, more than 1,200 bales of Yao cotton arrived, opening at thirty yuan and six jiao, and were purchased by the Guangdong and Yokohama groups.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to poor cotton harvest and active buying, but later declined due to some southern hedging. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 points, while futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 3 points. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton softened due to a lack of buyers and disappointing long positions, resulting in a decline of 7.5 jiao for Pingguoer and Aomula, and 5 jiao for Bailuoxi. The original telegram is recorded below (telegraph of the 29th):</p>

<p>Tianjin News: The Xihua cotton market is flat and stagnant, but sales are slightly developing. Foreign firms imported 80 bales, opening at 38 yuan, and another 120 bales, at 37 yuan. Yuwu Factory bought 700 bales, opening at 34-35 yuan. The cotton yarn market is idle and scattered. Customers' willingness to import is weaker than before. The market trend is sluggish. Renqiu merchants bought 23 bales of 16-count Luo Hu yarn, priced at 182.5 yuan, and 20 bales of 16-count Songhe yarn, priced at 183.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e270">Grains　Flour Bulls Spit Out This Month <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Reached a Low of Five Jiao at One Point</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, showed a trend of initial decline followed by an increase in the prices of various months. The quotations for foreign wheat showed increases of around two to three jiao in Chicago and one to two jiao in Canada. At the time of opening, market sentiment remained depressed, as delivery for the current month was approaching, and outside bulls had to close positions. The opening price was 5 jiao and 0.05 fen, quickly dropping to 5 jiao. Prices for later months also fell by nearly 1 fen. However, after the second session, the market improved due to active short covering. Prices for August and September improved by more than 2 fen compared to the opening, while prices for later months saw little change. When the afternoon session opened, market conditions for various months continued to soften. Due to inactivity from merchants and reports of actual deliveries for the current month from some factories, outside bulls continued to sell, resulting in a drop below 5 jiao to a low of 4 jiao 9.5 fen. Prices for later months also fell by one to two fen. As a result, the price for the current month continued to fall by 1.5 fen, September fell by 1.25 fen, October fell by 0.5 fen, November rose by 0.025 fen, December fell by 0.025 fen, and January fell by 0.5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after the morning opening, generally hovered. The quotations for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada improved by 1, 2 or 3 jiao. Thus, at the opening, the market was relatively stable. However, after the second session, the market became sluggish due to the weak flour market, and market sentiment softened. But because large traders entered and exited very little, the market did not rise or fall much. When the afternoon session opened, trading was quiet. Due to slight selling from inland merchants for September, the market softened, while the remaining months continued to hover. As a result, September fell by 4 fen, November fell by 1 fen, and December rose by 2 fen. There were no changes in other months. The spot wheat market was very quiet, factory intake was not high, and prices for medium and low grades fell by two or three fen. Opening prices for Xuzhou, Guide, Linhuaishan, Shandong Bengbu, and Dangshan wheat were 3.9 yuan, and 3.75 yuan for Yangzhou wheat, totaling 10,000 bags, which were handled by Fufeng.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were slightly more sources from various groups, totaling more than 20 (goods totaling over 3,000 shi), but the sales market remained sluggish. Market sentiment was uncertain due to the fluctuating weather, making the situation even more scattered. Very few out-of-town merchants came to the market to do business. Even with sellers willing to cut prices, there were few inquiries. As a result, transactions for thick japonica and late rice were extremely limited, leading to a further decline of approximately 1 jiao. The market for Du Yangjian and other types also went downstream. The new japonica market also continued to weaken by 1 to 2 jiao due to low intake. Changdong New only opened at 11.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were about 10 sources from various Lower River groups. Sales of various goods in the market, Baijing, selected for short prices were slightly reduced, and the remaining goods were sparse. Market prices for Baijing and Baodao were down a small amount, and the prices of Bai Yuanxintuanjian were slightly reduced, while Dujian was down about 2 jiao.

<p>Afternoon Market Activity Turns Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for foreign Xiang rice saw a watchful mood at the opening, with inland purchases halting and sentiment soft. All rice fell across the board. The previous days' market improvement was entirely brought about by enthusiastic buying from inland merchants, especially from various areas in Zhejiang province. Since rainfall had occurred in various places, the Zhejiang merchants all returned home. Purchases from inland areas also stopped. So yesterday's sudden drop in the market from the previous day had the inland areas completely stopping, cargo owners and union households sold with vigor, the rice merchants saw a reduction in price five to six jiao, Shashi Chen rough rice and Xiang Jingzhang rice was nine yuan three four jiao, Shashi machine milled rice only opened at ten yuan, and Hankou Yangzi rough rice opened at nine yuan seven jiao, the recent highest price opened at eleven yuan one jiao half, wider than the small had a huge difference of one yuan and a half, although the quality of the goods was slightly varied, but at least must step down near the 兀, The futures market for September Western goods was small to five yuan two jiao half, also compared to the decline of two jiao, other small ones one to two jiao, (all hundred jin count) After the market price plummeted, this street market began to take the opportunity to buy small amounts, and the market was tired.

The opening price for white factory light silk is still small, Chinese and foreign negotiations are still difficult to reach.

<p>— Cang</p>
<p>Being superior to contemporaries is not too difficult. Whether as a poet, novelist, playwright, or any kind of professional, this is indeed true.</p>
<p>Because there are originally not many "giants" in the current literary and artistic circles, it is easy for someone with a little talent to emerge. As someone said: In a land without birds, even bats are pleasing. So "literary figures" and the like easily become famous.</p>
<p>Fame is essentially empty, it exists based on one's career. Anyone who wants to achieve what they are doing will have no time to make themselves famous, and no energy to care about their fame. If their fame is detrimental to their career, they will escape fame, hide their name, and despise it. Just like a runner with the trophy in front of them, they will have no time to care about the spectators or look back at their fellow runners.</p>
<p>As for deliberately making oneself look a little better to please everyone, originally seeking fame and fortune, that is the "pandering to the world" type, also called "deceiving the world." It is also easy to become famous, because there are not many "giants" among appreciators and critics. Or there are giants, but for other reasons, they do not speak, letting them make noise.</p>
<p>Many newly famous writers originally had great hopes, but they made themselves very pitiable simply because of their love of fame. So, they are afraid of offending their masters, so, they are afraid of being out of touch with the times, and even more so, they are afraid of not looking like a certain ideology or school. Going along with the times, making a living under the whims of the times, the result is that they become like specimens in a science laboratory, labeled as XX professional, unable to soar.</p>
<p>People can never obliterate their own emotions, so they cannot be indifferent to praise and criticism, but too much concern is not good, it is better not to care. Seeking revenge for every complaint and laughing at every praise is such a great extravagance and damage, such as advocating essays and writing "Crossing the River," discussing the mass language and complaining about flying tiles, all of which are detrimental to "spirituality." Fame is a burden!</p>
<h3 id="e280">A Painful Memory in the Desert <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Lengquan</p>
<p>In that scorched earth and desert of the Northwest, I endured eight years of hardship. I experienced the prolonged drought of three or four years, and all kinds of strange changes. Many compatriots died tragically because of this, and I was still able to eke out a living, and I really felt extremely fortunate. In those times, I often thought: "The Northwest doesn't have enough food to eat, and I still came to eat!" Therefore, any extravagant hopes also disappeared.</p>
<p>From 1927 to 1934, the Northwest never had a good rain. The vast plains and hills, with red faces, seemed to be angry, and it was difficult to see a little green plant. The scorching sun fiercely emitted its fire, determined to burn everything on the ground to death. Sometimes, a sudden gust of wind would rise, and the sky would be filled with dust and sand, turning yellow as far as the eye could see, making people suspect that the end of the world was coming.</p>
<p>The tens of millions of people suffering from disasters still struggled and fought desperately with nature for survival. They drew sweat from dozens of feet deep wells to irrigate their fields (in various parts of the Northwest, it was often necessary to dig dozens of feet to get water). Finally, it was like pouring a cup of water into a hot pot, it could not help but evaporate all at once! The seedlings were withered, and the sweat was shed in vain. The scorching sun tormented them, causing them to die in the thousands and tens of thousands. Death was their only relief.</p>
<p>1929 was the year of the most severe disasters in the Northwest, with drought, cold, war, wolves, and rats. In addition, there were hungry soldiers searching for grain from house to house, and the hungry wolves came out of the mountains in groups to prey on humans and livestock.</p>
<p>Flour was three jins for a dollar, and coal was seven jins for a dollar. Human resources were so scarce. Therefore, many people used political power to deprive others of their lives in order to preserve their own. Helpless victims slept on the streets, eating yellow earth to barely survive. I have also witnessed it myself.</p>
<p>In mid-December of that year, the sky, which had not rained for a long time, suddenly had a heavy snow, and crows and sparrows froze to death in flocks. In the evening, those homeless victims often huddled together in groups of three or five in front of people's doorways, and by the next morning, they had died in piles there. If you were not careful, you would often bump into a zombie. Therefore, some people often piled snow in their doorways to prevent victims from sneaking in to sleep! The compassion of mankind was extinguished!</p>
<p>In that heavy snow, the sacrifice of life was truly unknown. The surviving victims with frozen hands and feet could be seen everywhere in Xi'an City. They were in rows and columns, some with the muscles on their hands and feet already rotten and peeling off, and the joints were still connected like human bone specimens. Some had completely frozen off their limbs, and the red and swollen flesh revealed white bones. Their limbs were so painful that they dared not touch the ground, sitting and wailing miserably.</p>
<p>Hunger, severe cold, scorching heat, and the exploitation of officials and gentry accelerated the destruction of that group of people's lives. At the same time, the warlords' wars often caused panic. In those three years, in Shaanxi Province alone, it is said that three million innocent people died tragically in this way.</p>
<p>Such a tragic sacrifice is even more painful than the group in Serafimovich's "Iron Flood." However, it is just a tragedy, what is the price?</p>
<h3 id="e281">Literary Jottings <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(6) Thus, writing became a rare commodity</p>
<p>Writing sprouted among the people, but later it was inevitably seized by those with privileges. According to the author of the "Book of Changes," "in ancient times, knots were tied for governance," so even tying knots was something for those who governed. When it fell into the hands of shamans and scribes, needless to say, they were all people below the chieftains but above the common people. As society changed, the scope of people learning to write also expanded, but it was mostly limited to those with privileges. As for the common people, they were illiterate, not because they lacked tuition fees, but because they were limited by qualifications; they were not worthy. Moreover, they couldn't even see books. In China, before block printing became developed, a good book was often "stored in secret cabinets and copied in three libraries." Even scholars still didn't know what was written in it.</p>
<p>Because writing was something for those with privileges, it had dignity and mystery. Chinese characters are still very dignified today. We often see baskets with the words "Cherish written paper" hanging on walls. As for talismans used for exorcism and healing, they relied on their mysteriousness. Since writing contained dignity, then the person who knew writing also became dignified. New dignitaries emerged endlessly, which was unfavorable to the old dignitaries. Moreover, if too many people knew writing, it would also damage the mysteriousness. The power of talismans was because these things that looked like characters were unrecognizable to anyone except Taoist priests. Therefore, they were bound to control writing. In medieval Europe, literature and learning were all in monasteries. In Croatia (Kroatla), even in the 19th century, only priests were literate. The people's spoken language regressed to being just enough for their old lives. When they reformed, they had to borrow many new words from foreign countries.</p>
<p>In China, in addition to status and economic limitations, Chinese writing also had a high barrier for the masses: difficulty. If one didn't spend ten years or so on it, it wouldn't be easy to cross this barrier. Those who crossed it were the scholar-officials, and these scholar-officials tried their best to make writing even more difficult, because this could make them particularly dignified, surpassing all other ordinary scholar-officials. Yang Xiong of the Han Dynasty, who liked strange characters, had this problem. When Liu Xin wanted to borrow his "Dialects" manuscript, he almost jumped into the Huangpu River. In the Tang Dynasty, Fan Zongshi's articles were made so that others couldn't punctuate them, and Li He's poems were made so that others couldn't understand them, all for this reason. Another method was to write characters so that others couldn't recognize them. The inferior ones would look up a few ancient characters from the "Kangxi Dictionary" and insert them into their articles. The superior ones were like Qian Dian, who used seal script to write Liu Xi's "Explanation of Names." Recently, there was also Mr. Qian Xuantong, who copied "Elementary Learning Questions and Answers" for Mr. Taiyan according to the "Shuowen" character forms.</p>
<p>Writing is difficult, and articles are difficult. These were all originally so. On top of these, the scholar-officials deliberately added difficulty. Yet, they still wanted it to have a connection with the masses. How could that be possible? But the scholar-officials wished it to be so. If writing were easy to recognize and everyone knew it, then writing wouldn't be dignified, and they wouldn't be dignified either. People who say that vernacular Chinese is inferior to classical Chinese start from this point. Now, those who discuss the language of the masses and say that it's enough to teach the masses the "Thousand Character Classic" still have the root of their meaning here.</p>

<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>When I was eight or nine years old, I became interested in painting. I still loved it in middle school. A drawing teacher once gave me the highest score in the whole grade. At that time, I planned to become a painter. Later, I finally got into an art school in Suzhou.</p>
<p>But as soon as I entered art school, I was dazzled.</p>
<p>Walking on the path of the Western-style building, staring blankly at those lively male classmates and beautifully dressed female students, listening to the piano and violin, my heart fluttered in the music wind.</p>
<p>Every day, walking into the school gate, gazing at a long rectangular plaque with the words "Palace of Art" Palace of art, a young and weak heart beat fast;</p>
<p>Oh, the magnificent and beautiful Palace of Art!</p>
<p>I heard the delicate classmates praising it so much.</p>
<p>So I lowered my head, timidly, and wandered in the Palace of Art.</p>
<p>What a charm it was to draw pictures by the green window! I enjoyed the happiness in the Palace of Art, as if I was slightly drunk, fluttering in the music wind, dreaming beautiful dreams, so I also grew my hair long and learned to be a painter.</p>
<p>But I came from the countryside, born in a poor family, after all, I was not worthy to enjoy the poetic life in the Palace of Art.</p>
<p>Finally, I was expelled from the Palace of Art.</p>
<p>Originally, I had taken the wrong path and should not have gone to the paradise of the sons and daughters of wealthy families.</p>
<p>My expulsion from the Palace of Art, I myself cannot explain what crime it was for. Does a rogue-like society have anything to say about the destruction of a youth? I have no defense. If a person does not die, he should work hard. One day, society will understand my cleanliness and frankness; but I should not have dreamed in the ivory tower. I understood that myself.</p>
<p>Without nostalgia, I walked out of the Palace of Art.</p>
<p>Goodbye! Delicate friends!</p>
<p>After waking up from the dream, deep pain attacked me. The rainy wind blew me like a flickering street lamp in the dusk, lost at the crossroads.</p>
<p>Vast world, where am I going? Wandering on the street at dusk, holding a cigarette butt, I am a young unemployed man!</p>
<p>Carrying confused sorrow, trudging on the indifferent world, confused like a journey in the dusk, I advise myself:</p>
<p>Having groped through the dark night, tomorrow may be a sunny day!</p>
<p>Carrying my twenty-one years of sad heart, groping on the dark road.</p>
<p>Being expelled from the Palace of Art, I have no regrets. Shaking off the tired spirit, walking out of the dark road stretching in the dusk, maybe it is my chance for a new life!</p>
<h3 id="e283">Remembering Lily Kobbe <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Mr. Hui Tian sent the translation of "Lily Kobbe's Sleeping Shanghai." Reading it, it was completely different from when I was blankly facing the German original. I understood that this is how it was said. Then, I suddenly thought of Mr. Ren's words. He said that this girl! Mr. Ren always liked to call her girl—lived in Shanghai for more than ten days. Although she wanted to know the situation in China, she actually gained nothing. However, in my opinion, she already knew Shanghai very clearly. "Sleeping Shanghai" can be used as proof.</p>
<p>Now, she has gone to Beiping. Maybe there, she will recognize the face of China? In any case, I think her harvest from this trip to China will be more than Bernard Shaw's. As soon as Shaw arrived in Shanghai, he was taken by car to the salons of the wealthy, to see the faces of reporters and celebrities. Afterwards, he was still taken back to the ship by car. When he arrived in Beiping, he only ate at the general's mansion and looked down at the Great Wall from an airplane. The Great Wall was all he saw. What else did he see? Lily Kobbe, on the other hand, had ridden a rickshaw in Shanghai, been chased by dirty beggars, and been despised by the people in the third-class train. She had also been to factories in Zhabei and squeezed among the "wild chickens" near the Great World... Receiving the disdain of reporters, literati, and scholars, she ran around alone and actually discovered the secret core of Shanghai. When she arrives in Beiping, it will probably be the same, so she will know China.</p>
<p>It is said that in Japan, the police acted as her guide. If she wanted to see the lives of farmers, she would be taken to the magnificent living room of a landlord. In Shanghai, she did not encounter such a guide, so she felt very lucky. However, she did not know the reason. In fact, it was because Shanghai did not need such a guide at all. Japan is Japan, so the Japanese police have an obligation to cover up for themselves. But Shanghai is the Shanghai of China, ruled by Westerners. The police are supported by Westerners, and the shameful things in Shanghai only concern China's dignity, so the Western police don't need to cover them up. Moreover, the work of covering up ugliness can probably only be done in Japanese cities. In Shanghai, isn't there a canal full of "dirty water" below the aerial garden on the five-story building where "Mr. Willie" lives? And on the sampans in the canal, are Chinese coolies sleeping?</p>

<h3 id="e285">Younger Brother (5) <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Later, life became more and more difficult day by day, and the store could barely stay open. Mom told me not to study anymore, but to take advantage of having a relative who was an official in the army and go to him. As for my younger brother, he was already fourteen years old, so we could only let him study for two more years so he could manage the store, and Mom would have a substitute.</p>
<p>This day, when I was discussing it with Mom, my younger brother secretly listened for a while on the other side of the door, then went out to gamble without saying a word. Because it was New Year's, Mom didn't mind him. Sometimes I asked him:</p>
<p>"Younger brother, what school do you want to study in this year?"</p>
<p>"None of your business!" He paused for a moment and walked away with his big eyes.</p>
<p>After that, the shop assistants teased him:</p>
<p>"Little Zhou! You're still gambling; your brother is going to be an official!"</p>
<p>My younger brother put down his cards, glared his eyes, and said:</p>
<p>"I don't care, bah, being an official! You also call me Little Zhou, Little Zhou, damn you!"</p>
<p>"Look at you, you don't look like an official at all!" They still teased him.</p>
<p>"Damn your mother!"</p>
<p>Mom suddenly came out with a board:</p>
<p>"I don't believe it, can't I hit you just because it's New Year's! Humph, you want to be unruly, wait until I close my eyes!"</p>
<p>My younger brother was so angry that his eyes were straight. He poked Wang Er next to him, threw the cards, and ran away in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>One day, a shop assistant told Mom that he had heard Wang Er next door discussing running away with my younger brother. Mom quickly opened the cabinet in the room to check. The money was fine, not touched at all. Then she quickly found a lock to lock it up. She thought he wouldn't dare to run away without money. Moreover, he had never been out before, so he and Wang Er certainly wouldn't know which way to go. She just had to watch out for him.</p>

<h3 id="e286">Miscellaneous Talk on the Ye Muhua Case <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Peng</p>
<p>Since the Ye Muhua case occurred several months ago, our country's authorities have made absolutely no indication due to the state of national power. Although our consul in Nagasaki submitted a routine protest in the middle, it certainly did not obtain any key points. Originally, such a common tragic case had long failed to arouse the revulsion of the nation whose nerves were already paralyzed. If Ye Muhua had not returned to the country this time to appeal, I am afraid that this matter would have been permanently excluded from the memory of the nation. But the nation's sentiment of common hatred for the enemy has become so indifferent to this extent that it really makes one feel like the country is dying with each passing day, and feel neither like crying nor laughing!</p>
<p>During this so-called "emergency period," Japanese imperialists are frantically and actively preparing for war, especially for the invasion of China, which they are determined not to let go of. Since the Northeast was forcibly occupied, the so-called "Manchuria-Mongolia policy" has been desperately seeking its full realization. Therefore, aggression against China has become Japan's main task at present, and the seeds of invading China have been planted in the minds of every Japanese citizen. The idea of ​​hating Chinese people has also developed rapidly (it is a pity that some treasures are still chanting about "Sino-Japanese friendship"! ). The murder of Qi Muhua is not an accidental phenomenon, but a reflection of the ferocious face of the entire Japanese imperialist.</p>
<p>We still remember the telegram from overseas Chinese in Nagasaki appealing for the Ye case, which gave a bloody account of the tragic situation of Qi Jun's death at that time. Based on this bloody fact, the cruelty and inhumanity of the Japanese have been thoroughly exposed. Please see that after repeatedly seeking opportunities to insult and scold him for two consecutive days, he finally took out the seven-inch knife hidden in his chest and stabbed Ye Jun's left chest fiercely. This planned act of violence must have had considerable preparation in advance. According to reason and logic, it was obviously an intentional premeditated murder. The Japanese court has been protecting him in every possible way, using the excuse that the murderer has not reached the legal age and shirking responsibility and exonerating him is directly trying to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand. Their vicious attitude will be more clearly seen by the world.</p>
<p>Before the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese authorities repeatedly protested and threatened us under the pretext of the so-called "Nakamura Incident." Whether Nakamura existed or not, and whether he ever disappeared, even if he did, who should be responsible for this? All of this remains a mystery to this day. However, the Japanese used this incident as a pretext to further implement active military aggression, and then caused the outbreak of the "September 18th" Incident, forcibly occupying the territory of our northeastern provinces. Not long ago, Zang Ben disappeared in Nanjing. The way the Japanese dispatched ships to increase troops and threatened and intimidated us, if compared with the Ye case, one is intentional premeditated murder, and the other is intentional suicide to find a pretext for their certain attempt. The seriousness of the situation is already clear and obvious, and everyone knows it. "Humans with the same round heads and square feet, because of the strength or weakness of the country, the weight of the value of their lives is so different!" It is really regrettable.</p>
<p>The Ye case has occurred for a long time, and the nation has not yet made an appropriate expression. Ye's death is not a pity, but it is hateful that Ye died for the country and was humiliated. It is even more infuriating that the evidence after death is solid but it cannot achieve the purposes of punishing the murderer, compensation and apology! This case concerns the honor and disgrace of the entire country and the safety of the lives of overseas Chinese. If the national spirit of the Chinese nation has not yet been completely lost, it should swear to resist to the end. In recent years, our compatriots abroad have been humiliated, squeezed, expelled and massacred by foreign races everywhere. If the nation still does not rise up to struggle, strive to become stronger, and let others be the knife and ourselves be the fish, then in such a large area of ​​the world, there will never be a place for Chinese people to stand.</p>
<h3 id="e287">On "Literary Heritage" and "Foreign Stereotyped Essays" (Continued) <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Tang</p>
<p>Now let's first look at his so-called sorting out China's literary heritage and accepting China's literary heritage. Is it "going to the camp of Chinese old literature to detonate bombs" and doing the work of disinfecting Chinese literature? The facts answer us, no. First, in the entire "Special Issue on Chinese Literature Research," we did not see an article, not even a single word, saying that their work was "going to the camp of Chinese old literature to detonate bombs" and doing the work of "disinfecting" Chinese literature. It exists in the second issue of the third volume of "Literature." However, this was after my so-called "foreign stereotyped essay" was discovered in the local supplement. Is this a later addition? Or did they forget it at the time? This is a bit difficult to figure out. However, they may say that this is because you don't have eyes, and we had already said it in a "veiled" way in the "Special Issue on Chinese Literature Research." Furthermore, this matter does not need to be stated explicitly. At this time, to propose to reorganize China's literary heritage and accept China's literary heritage, of course, it includes the meaning of "going to the camp of Chinese old literature to detonate bombs" and doing the work of "disinfecting" Chinese literature. Then I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>However, the fact is still the fact. When a thief takes someone's things, if someone asks, he will definitely say that he picked it up, or how he got it somewhere. Of course, he will definitely not say that I stole it somewhere. "Literature" very simply said at first that we want to reorganize China's literary heritage and accept China's literary heritage with new methods. Later, it added that this is "going to the camp of Chinese old characters to detonate bombs." Who knows that this must not be a thief-style evasive "excuse"!</p>
<p>However, the people of "Literature" are still worthy of our admiration. First, they proposed to reorganize China's literary heritage and accept China's literary heritage, which is to go to China's "old literary camp" to find the "gold sand" they need. Then they said that this work is "going to the camp of Chinese old literature to detonate bombs." At least, this point of dodging is already very "valuable."</p>
<p>Secondly, what "Feng" Jun is most proud of in attacking my article is saying that my article is a complete so-called "foreign stereotyped essay." This is very meaningful. "Feng" Jun said that my article is a "foreign stereotyped essay." In this way, all my words have been completely overturned by him. This is a very fierce, vicious and very clever way of saying it. However, anyone with clear eyes can see what kind of method this is. To put it bluntly, "Feng" Jun has only learned the most basic method of "putting a red hat" on others from a group of political secret agents. In my opinion, this method is really basic. Can "Feng" Jun say that because my article is a "foreign stereotyped essay," the reorganization of China's literary heritage and the acceptance of China's literary heritage proposed by "Literature" must be said to be a meaningful work no matter what? Can the gentlemen of "Literature" be so "bold"? The method of "putting hats" on people is now played too ordinary. Unexpectedly, for this small problem, the gentlemen of "Literature" also solemnly applied this most basic and contemptible method, which is a bit pitiful.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that although "Feng" Jun used all his strength to prove that my article was a "foreign stereotyped essay," he himself also fell deeply into the quagmire of "foreign stereotyped essay" at the same time. Not only is it a "foreign stereotyped essay," but it is also the most inferior "local stereotyped essay" that is more inferior than the "foreign stereotyped essay." Let's see: What is "Feng" Jun most proud of in that article? It's just some of the most boring "searching for chapters and excerpts" style of criticism on the text. May I ask "Feng" Jun, how much more brilliant is this than my "foreign stereotyped essay"?</p>
<p>The attitude of "Feng" Jun in writing that article is exaggerated and severe. This is probably because "Literature" is a magazine with a relatively high status in China, so their every move is "different from the public." My article was just written in a hurry, and it was revised by others, so there are indeed many unsmooth and procrastination points in the middle section. This is inevitable. I am not a "writer," so there are certainly many arguments in the text from time to time. We have never seen this kind of situation. Probably because "Literature" has a position, their writers must be "first-class" in logic.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>In fact, your things may not necessarily be able to dominate "China's literary world" now. There are many Chinese people with clear eyes, and their eyes are not looking at you now.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to advise the gentlemen of "Literature." I think it is better for you to quietly and peacefully do some work in picking "gold sand" from China's literary heritage. Originally, that is the place where you can "relax and enjoy yourselves." If you must hold the "gold sand" in China's literary heritage in one hand, and "detonate bombs in China's literary camp" in the other, it will be too disgusting to see. However, this is what the gentlemen of "Literature" are unwilling to admit frankly. Then forgive me for saying something "incisive," how did "Literature" continue to be maintained in the first place?</p>
<p>However, in the end, I still think that the gentlemen of "Literature" are worthy of admiration. It is because they can "pick gold sand" in one hand and "detonate bombs" in the other. At the same time, they can also "put hats" on people and quickly (perhaps they can already) learn the skills of political secret agents. This is where the gentlemen of "Literature" are far beyond us. My admiration for "Literature" lies in these two points. (Appendix: The second issue of the third volume of "Literature" was published on August 1st. It was not until about the 8th that someone told me that there was an article attacking me in it. Then I got sick again, so I was able to write an answer until today. I hereby state this).</p>
<h3 id="e288">The Sorrow of the Ghost <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Yang</p>
<p>I don't know how long I was in a coma before I was awakened by a sad cry. This cry was strangely familiar, like my wife, like my daughter-in-law. He wondered why they were crying for no reason? But when he raised his eyes, he found several nuns performing the work of delivering him to the afterlife. The sound of the wooden fish rhythmically beat on his heart with the crying.</p>
<p>Am I dead?</p>
<p>He jumped up in a hurry, feeling much lighter. He looked at the bed, like a large mirror; lying inside was another self.</p>
<p>He didn't know when he was lying in the hall; he couldn't remember how he died! He wanted to ask his wife, ask his daughter-in-law, but they ignored him, as if they didn't recognize him at all.</p>
<p>Yes, he had entered another world. They couldn't see him, although he could clearly see them, but he couldn't let them know that he was standing in front of them.</p>
<p>He felt the sorrow of eternal separation.</p>
<p>Floating past his wife, past his daughter-in-law, past the nuns, he walked out of the hall and towards his home.</p>
<p>Under the corridor, he saw his three brothers talking about the cause of his death with red eyes, so he quietly sat on the empty chair opposite and listened.</p>
<p>From his brothers, he learned that he had died of a stroke, like his eldest sister, dying very quickly, in just three hours.</p>
<p>He also talked about his eldest sister, who was as fat as himself. She died when she was fifty-four years old. When he went to pay his respects that night, he saw her pacing around him in the bed.</p>
<p>Six nine fifty-four, dark nine, he always worried about it, fearing that he would not be able to pass that hurdle.</p>
<p>Now it was confirmed that he lived to the same age as his eldest sister and suffered from the same disease as his eldest sister.</p>
<p>Looking at the relatives and friends who had come from afar for him sitting in the courtyard and corridor, they all talked about his death with exclamation, and the sorrow, both indirect and direct, was smeared on everyone's face, deeply or shallowly.</p>
<p>His eyes swept across everyone's face, but he couldn't find his sons. They were far away in S port, and maybe they didn't even know he was dead.</p>
<p>His empty heart ached faintly, father and son were originally connected at heart.</p>
<p>Floating around the corner of the corridor, that was his home. He looked at everything in the room with attachment. His most beloved grandson was clamoring for hunger at this time. He pitifully said: "Grandpa is dead, no one will buy me things to eat?"</p>
<p>He happily walked over, stroking his grandson's head and kissing his grandson's face. He was surprised that no one paid attention to him when he was clamoring like that. He raised his eyes and found his basket placed by the bed, so he lovingly told his grandson: there are things you like to eat hidden inside, and pointed it out to him with his finger.</p>
<p>The grandson's clamor turned into crying. He didn't feel his existence and sobbed, "Grandpa is dead, no one will buy me things to eat?"</p>
<p>His heart was broken. In the eyes of his loved ones, he could no longer be seen, and in the ears of his loved ones, he could no longer be heard. He hated why omnipotent scientists did not invent a tool to convey thoughts between the living and the dead.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Thinking of My Hometown <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought of my hometown and couldn't help but sink into melancholy.</p>
<p>I haven't been back for several years. Long days drift by in a foreign land, like duckweed floating on water, stopping wherever is convenient, and gradually becoming accustomed to the life of a wanderer. The longing for my hometown has gradually faded, almost to the point of becoming a vague memory.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in a certain state of mind, a faint image of longing emerges, but these moments are rare. However, in my memory, my hometown is always beautiful and serene. Although I've been away for many years, people from my hometown often bring news, letting me know that it's not the dreamlike place I remember, but has undergone great changes, deteriorating day by day.</p>
<p>Yet, in my memory, my hometown remains a beautiful and cherished place!</p>
<p>The scenery there is hard to find here:</p>
<p>People's lives are full of joy and happiness. Early in the morning, little sparrows chirp on the pomegranate branches, singing their morning songs, without needing a clock to tell the time. Just hearing the crisp voices of the sparrows, everyone knows it's dawn and gets out of bed, each tending to their daily tasks. Women carry clothes and lead their children to the ponds outside their homes to wash them. The gurgling of the water echoes from the pond, mixed with laughter, like the music of dawn carried on the breeze. Children leave their mothers' sides and run freely on the grass, catching grasshoppers. When they catch one, they run joyfully back to their mothers, jumping and talking, expressing their happy and proud feelings.</p>
<p>It is truly a primitive and simple scene of local customs!</p>
<p>After washing clothes, they take their children home. The children walk ahead, singing folk songs, while the mothers follow behind, chatting and laughing. Every face bathed in the gentle sunlight is soft and cheerful.</p>
<p>Then, wisps of smoke begin to rise from the roofs of every house. After breakfast, the children go to school one by one, while the mothers do some light needlework.</p>
<p>The hometown I remember is so peaceful and beautiful, making one want to savor it endlessly.</p>
<p>But the reality of my hometown has probably destroyed this tranquility long ago!</p>
<p>And so, a dim picture weaves itself into my mind:</p>
<p>Many people have given up crying and wear faces of resentment and sorrow, living their lives in misery. Heavy clouds of life weigh down on their heads and hearts. Even when they gather together, they remain silent and listless. All kinds of worries have taken away their joy, and sighs and anxieties have replaced happiness. The cruel beating of life has made them lifeless, their bodies and minds withered.</p>
<p>Many have been forced to abandon their beloved homes and hometowns, seeking a living in cities and other places. As a result, the doors of many houses are tightly closed, without a sound, as desolate as ancient temples, with spiders weaving their webs, becoming their home!!!</p>
<p>How desolate it has become, my hometown!</p>
<p>The beauty of my hometown makes me even more reluctant to return. Faced with reality, my ideal dreams would shatter like a cup filled with red wine dashed against a rock.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Heart in a Sanatorium <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>White wind, white, cold air currents,</p>
<p>White flowers of anemia.</p>
<p>(The large window of the sanatorium room faces south.</p>
<p>Illness is white, dreams are white, alcohol is white, cotton wool is white, medicine bottles and syringes are white, the young nurse is white...</p>
<p>In the morning, the nurse brought a bouquet of flowers and placed them in a large vase in the center of the table by the bed. The fragrance is suffocating.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Italian wild roses, blooming towards the southern sun.</p>
<p>A face flashing with the healthy, blood-red glow of youth.</p>
<p>Images drift away, far away, implying the southern sun of Italy, and the bracing, alcohol-tinged breeze of Cheng Lianer.</p>
<p>The patient holds a legendary heart, eyes closed in peaceful repose.</p>
<p>The sick heart needs white treatment.)</p>
<p>In the morning, the streetcar stops in front of the Hamilton Building, routinely spitting out a batch of people and swallowing another, and then clumsily crawls forward on its scorching journey. Looking at the number B27 marked on the back of the car, I am left in front of the building that holds the central hub of culture and commerce of a part of the metropolis.</p>
<p>Walking inside, then—</p>
<p>The daytime sun disappears, I am lifted to the top floor of the building by the elevator, I write my name in the signing-in book, I enjoy the white-hot light of the underground floor, I type "Dear Sir/Madam," "Your letter has been received," "Presenting the matter of XXXX," on the typewriter, I make red and blue marks in the compilation of numbers "...</p>
<p>At dusk, standing on the bustling street, watching the rotation of the wheels and the changing of traffic lights, my self-awareness is awakened: "Creatures under the collective action of the metropolis are 100% mechanized. People are gears, people are cranks, people are screws."</p>
<p>People living under mechanical construction, their blood is surging, their will is agitated, their hearts are pounding, and their brains are hardening.</p>
<p>But hidden behind all this, isn't it the whip of life? Under the whip of life, countless mechanized hearts have blossomed: flowers are pale white, tubercular, neurasthenic, anemic.</p>
<p>Panting palely.</p>
<p>(Say, is the heart sick? A sick heart needs treatment; but I hate the pretentious white of medicine, and anemic patients hate the bleak white, and even in the sanatorium, I hate the weight of the machine; but I also hate the leisure of recuperation.)</p>
<p>One morning, I suddenly saw the newly rising sun, shocked as if by a miracle: at this moment, the bleak white of medicine also carried a bit of healthy red. The sun is constantly moving and burning. In the unfathomable high temperature, it is constantly moving, living, creating days, weaving history. What does mechanical life matter? The machine is moving, running, rubbing, connecting, and thus generates heat and the force of work. Isn't this the best treatment for neurasthenia?</p>
<p>Thinking of the people in the city who are completing the task of another part in the machine, and who have a sick heart, I think of a rusty machine, a machine that is sick: every part is stagnant. There is fuel and there is power, but there is a lack of someone to start it; but in mankind, the one who starts it is the people who are making another part themselves.</p>
<p>If it is said that an unhealthy person should have some exercise, then why let a sick heart remain still? The leisurely treatment in the sanatorium is fundamentally morbid and pale. The symbol of health should be a full, blood-red color.</p>
<p>(It seems that I threw a fire at the sick heart without much thought, and the leisurely, morbid, and medical paleness of the sanatorium disappeared from my eyes.)</p>
<p>A sick heart needs treatment; but this treatment is new and reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Youth and Cultivation <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ben</p>
<p>Based on my speculation, and confirmed by several senior elders, the youth of twenty or thirty years ago were all "mature beyond their years" and "had a majestic demeanor." This was a reflection of the times and society. The social form of China twenty or thirty years ago was bound to produce such youth. But times have evolved, and now it's completely the opposite. Young people are mostly impetuous and shallow, regarding cultivation as pedantic and rejecting it out of hand. Naturally, this is also a reflection of the times and society. But what if a child who hasn't learned to walk tries to run? Wouldn't they fall?</p>
<p>As a result, many people look down on young people and regret their immaturity. But everyone has this expectation: youth has great hope, and youth has even greater responsibility. The future of the country and society depends entirely on the youth. Today's youth will be the masters of society and the country.</p>
<p>However, it's very dangerous! But I don't despise youth at all. I am one of them.</p>
<p>I just feel an urgent danger for myself. We really need some cultivation.</p>
<p>Before talking about cultivation, it's necessary to make a general point about the common shortcomings of modern youth. In my opinion, the shortcomings of modern youth are not in courage, but in timidity; not in aging, but in impetuosity; not in shirking responsibility, but in lack of perseverance; not in shallow knowledge, but in lack of confidence in seeking knowledge; not in indulging in bad habits, but in lack of genuine hobbies. As a result, everyone naturally walks toward a downward path, unable to extricate themselves. In short, the problem with today's youth is timidity, inertia, lack of ambition, perfunctoriness, shortsightedness, and muddling through. This is their attitude toward themselves, others, and society. As a result, they can't withstand the storms and soon wither. No one has great hope.</p>
<p>I deeply feel that we young people should have the following kinds of cultivation:</p>
<p>First, wash away the heart of inertia and replace it with a spirit of conscientiousness and responsibility. Broadly speaking, this so-called conscientiousness and responsibility means being conscientious and responsible for one's own life.</p>
<p>Second, wash away the timid and conservative mentality and replace it with a spirit of adventure and fortitude. Many great people and great achievements are accomplished in this way.</p>
<p>Third, get rid of the "shirking" mentality and replace it with a spirit of seeking advancement. We young people haven't actually learned much or understand much, but everyone has a bit of complacency. We must know that like the vast ocean of knowledge, we must explore it step by step.</p>
<p>Fourth, get rid of bad habits and replace them with genuine hobbies.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say. I'll leave it at that.</p>

<h3 id="e292">The Howl of Johnny Weissmuller, Star of "Tarzan the Ape Man" <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— A Bai</p>
<p>Since the roaring success of "Tarzan the Ape Man" in China, people have been wondering whether Johnny Weissmuller, specially created by God, really has such a strong physique, tree-climbing agility, and beast-catching skills, or whether it's all due to the magic of the camera. Among young people who admire him and women who secretly admire and worship masculine "health" and "strength," it is indeed a frequently and hotly debated topic.</p>
<p>Another thing that audiences around the world have been questioning is his earth-shattering howl. We should remember that in "Tarzan the Ape Man," the world swimming champion didn't speak, except for so-called ape language, elephant language, and other animal languages that we can't understand, and the words "I," "love," and "you" that his white partner Joan taught him. All that was transmitted from the sound system behind the screen to the audience's ears was his loud, long, and modulated howl. The shrillness of the howl made it almost unimaginable that it was a human calling!</p>
<p>In the weeks after the completion of "Tarzan the Ape Man," invitations from people eager to see his true face flooded in. Weissmuller, having been deprived of the taste of socializing for so long, was becoming restless. So he decided to keep the long, shaggy hair of a savage that MGM was eager to use for "Tarzan and His Mate" and strictly forbade him to shave, put on the evening dress that had long bound his burly frame, and went to the party.</p>
<p>As he steadily walked into the middle of the guests, his head and shoulders, supported by his six-foot-three-inch frame, towered above all the men and women in the room. Enthusiastic applause came from the soft hands of the women, and curious gazes were directed at this bull-like figure from the eyes of the men.</p>
<p>Later, a wealthy widow grabbed Weissmuller and walked him to the balcony. He, who was used to quietness, was feeling suffocated by the crowds and felt the need to breathe fresh air, so he happily followed. But the wealthy widow led him all the way to the garden, where she suddenly begged him, "Tarzan, please give me a howl!"</p>
<p>There are more than just thousands of people who are as suspicious and curious as the wealthy widow. Weissmuller has performed publicly at the request of audiences. When more than 6,000 young people gathered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for "Youth Week," "Weissmuller stood on the world's largest stage, hesitated for a moment, and took a deep breath, expanding his chest, which was 43 and three-quarters inches wide. The cry was suddenly released from his mouth and spread to every corner of this unique venue.</p>
<p>It has been two and a half years since Weissmuller filmed "Tarzan the Ape Man." For these full eight hundred days, he has been playing the role of "Tarzan and His Mate" under MGM's plan. According to newspaper reports, this film, which is more exciting than "Tarzan the Ape Man," was officially completed in the United States on April 20. And people in the film industry are also rumored that the film has been approved for release by the central authorities. The days when we will see him fighting ferocious beasts and hear his long howls on the screens of this city are not far off!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e293">Review of "The Thin Man" <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Thin Man 丨Nanjing</p>
<p>Usual detective films are all about creating tension and excitement, making people eagerly wait for the truth to emerge in a bizarre murder case. In other words, it is the greatest responsibility of screenwriters to construct a story that is as tortuous as possible, and of directors to create an atmosphere that is very serious and terrifying. However, not every detective film can achieve this level. On the contrary, they are usually extraordinarily dull, which is not very appealing to "entertainment-seeking" audiences. What they want is to be "delighted" and "slowly sink into the sofa," but the result is a sleepy slumber that is not at all exciting. If they can't even do that, what else can they do? As for our demand that detective films at least have new content, that is even more difficult to obtain in American films at this stage.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is indeed true that detective films are not welcomed by the general audience. Therefore, clever filmmakers have had to find other ways. Although they cannot obtain new content, they must at least try new things in form. This is something that we can find considerable proof of in W. S. Van Dyke's "The Thin Man."</p>
<p>We will not ignore the fact that this detective film, like many similar works, has no new content at all. An electrical scholar loses 100,000 shares, and soon after, he disappears. Then, two people die tragically one after another, and another person also goes missing. They are all related to the case. Afterward, the case is solved through the investigation of a retired detective. It turns out that the filmmaker was assassinated and hidden by his legal advisor, and the other two victims were also killed by him because he had received half of the 100,000 shares. In this story, can we find anything better than the so-called lawyer breaking the law? No, like general love or robbery cases, there is nothing worth mentioning.</p>
<p>However, the screenwriter and director have made up for this ordinary content with the form of comedy, so they tried their best to write the detective as a remarkable character. He lives a romantic life, he doesn't care about anything, and at the same time, he is very calm and alert. In his personal life, the description of him and his wife is very interesting and vivid, which breaks up a lot of the dull atmosphere that is common in detective films. Precisely because of this, the director tried his best to portray him, so he became a purely unrealistic and ideal character. The most obvious example is when he and another detective are at Heino's house, he is blowing smoke rings in a tense atmosphere. When he is entertaining the suspects and the perpetrator draws a gun and shoots, he immediately punches him to the ground. Similarly, when he and his wife are joking in bed and a thug breaks in, attempting to commit a crime, he calmly handles the situation and eventually knocks the thug down with his bare hands. This exaggerated portrayal is made even more "miraculous" by William Powell's performance, so the detective's talent makes one dare not believe it.</p>
<p>But does this work end with humor? At least we think the scene where he invites the suspects is still quite dull. Generally speaking, it is better to watch it as a general comedy than as a detective film. Myrna Loy also performed very well.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Zasu Pitts' Ideal Wife <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Zasu Pitts has been in the film industry for five or six years. She received a lot of honor in "Greed," but she is still single. She not only doesn't have a lover, but she has never even had a partner.</p>
<p>Although her status is far less than that of John Gilbert, the late Rudolph Valentino, and the current Clark Gable and Ramon Novarro, there are quite a few women in Hollywood who admire her, but she doesn't have the slightest attachment to them.</p>
<p>Once, at a tea dance in Hollywood late at night, Zasu Pitts was about to stand up from a secluded seat and go home to sleep when a woman suddenly walked over and sat next to her, greeting her. She opened a bottle of champagne, poured a glass, drank half of it herself, and asked Zasu Pitts to drink the remaining half. She was disgusted, but thinking that she couldn't escape, she had to reluctantly drink it. The woman then further requested her to "open water." Zasu Pitts was in a dilemma, but fearing that she would become angry, she had no choice but to accept her request, while secretly whispering in her ear, "Isn't that your husband over there at the door?" The woman didn't have time to look closely and immediately fled, and Zasu Pitts got a plan to escape.</p>
<p>Zasu Pitts rejected such women more than once, countless times. In social situations, she has never been involved in romance. People in Hollywood regard her character as stupid. But is she really stupid? Doesn't she portray love on the screen with reason and emotion? Originally, she had her reasons.</p>
<p>She hasn't mentioned the issue of marrying a wife yet. She said, "There is no reason not to marry a wife. If I don't marry now, I will marry in the future. It's just a matter of time. But even if I want to have a lover, I will never have one in Hollywood. I think life in the film industry is too dangerous. In the future, I will definitely go to the countryside and become a farmer. I think if I go to the countryside to live, would women in Hollywood be willing to go to the countryside with me?"</p>
<p>So, Zasu Pitts already has an ideal wife in her heart.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Doing Birthday Bad Things, Damned Should Die But Don't Die <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>Marie Dressler died. Someone asked why American film magazines didn't have much grand coverage? It seems that even her birthday wasn't advertised as loudly. Of course, grief cannot be expressed in words, only tears and sorrow float on everyone's faces. Indeed, it was a great loss for America and a pain for Hollywood. When her illness became increasingly serious, Hollywood and audiences across the country were praying for her, and President Roosevelt also sent her a telegram, wishing her a speedy recovery. But Heaven didn't pity her, and she passed away. Marie was ill for a total of two years. During that time, she also worked hard for a long time despite her illness. She had always been physically strong, and everyone thought she would recover, but because she took responsibility too seriously, she couldn't take a long-term, complete rest, which led to the fact that the old woman in her sixties couldn't support it anymore. After her death, there was still a film called Living in a Big Way that she wasn't able to start filming, which is especially regrettable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Chinese superstition, especially in the South, it is not good to celebrate birthdays in a big way. Last November 9, Hollywood celebrated the old woman's birthday in a big way. The President also sent a telegram to congratulate her, and the governors of various states in the United States sent her local specialties as gifts. She received no less than hundreds of thousands of congratulatory telegrams. It set an unprecedented precedent in the entertainment world. According to superstitious people, celebrating her birthday did bad things. Then why didn't the damned birthday person die?</p>

<h3 id="e296">Affairs of Cellini (I) <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Luo</p>
<p>Starring Constance Bennett and Frederic March, produced by 20th Century Corporation of America</p>
<p>She was born graceful and poised, the Duchess of Medici, so poised and graceful that men who saw her couldn't help but neglect sleep and food. Poised... but also ruthless... Only the Medici family could be so ruthless. But she had been kind once. Once... her eyes lost their shimmering edge, her cherry lips lost their domineering air. Once, her heart became like any woman's heart, easily broken and wounded, as any woman would feel a sudden chill and sigh softly. All morning, he sat high in the council chamber, grandly judging his unfortunate subjects, unfortunate enough to incur his displeasure. All morning, he had been incited by the eloquent Ottaviano, dispatching those criminals as he pleased. This one should die slowly, his flesh cut piece by piece to suffer more; this one should be hanged first, then his body quartered and dismembered; this one should be nailed and slowly burned to death; this one was comparatively fortunate, allowed to be imprisoned in a stone cellar for life, never to see the sun, moon, or stars again. Then Ottaviano mentioned the name of a person awaiting judgment, a man named Benvenuto Cellini, the world's unprecedented goldsmith... artisan. Ottaviano demanded that the Duke sentence him to death. Now the Duchess arrived, also demanding that he be sentenced to death, that audacious madman, daring to lightly disobey her will, failing to present the gold plate she had commissioned by the deadline, simply a contempt for the Medici family's dignity. Ottaviano, hearing that the Duchess also wanted him executed, secretly rejoiced. He bowed to the Duke and said, "This matter is best left to me. This murderer must not be allowed to roam free any longer." The Duchess glanced at the Duke and said, "A murderer! Shouldn't a murderer be hanged?" The Duke shifted uneasily on his throne, unable to withstand his wife's fierce glare. He stammered, "We're just waiting for him to finish those plates. Besides, it was just a bit of swordplay, a bit of trouble, just the kind of thing warriors like." The Duchess's blue eyes flashed with fire, she said impatiently, "Can't we find a second goldsmith in all of Florence?" The Duke smiled ingratiatingly, "Of course, there's no shortage of artisans, but we can't find a second with his genius." Ottaviano, seeing that the Duke had some intention of protecting Cellini, quickly interjected, "There are others accusing him. Even now, there is a plaintiff waiting to request your judgment." As he spoke, with a triumphant smirk, he turned to look at the person who had just been brought in. The Duchess's beautiful eyes were fixed on a girl standing behind that man. She thought to herself that she used to be like that... like peach blossoms in the March spring breeze, clinging to her cheeks, and like dewdrops on a summer morning, lingering in her pupils, but her whole body was flawless and untouched by the world. The man bowed deeply to the Duke's throne and said: (This girl is the youngest daughter of a noble family of Wanqi, this affair is also a great humiliation, a great insult to the royal family...) (To be continued)</p>
