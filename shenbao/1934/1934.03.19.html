<p>時評</p>
<h3>憲草初稿之商𣙜廷</h3>
<p>原我國今日憲法之草訂。無非欲爲全國朝野樹立一共相信守之根本大法。所以藉此而由國民黨訓政時期轉入人民直接主政之憲政時期。憲草擬稿人士之苦心孤詣。寗不爲吾人所共見。然自鼎革以還。關於國憲一事。自民元臨時約法至民二十之訓政時期約法。屢有所覩。制憲救國之聲浪。亦旣習聞而厭。因此一般人對此制憲。亦抱冷淡態度者多。夫以憲草會人士經年心血之結晶。而其所得國民之響應。乃若是其微弱。斯可慨也。惟在國家建設過程中。制憲自爲一不容忽略之步驟。因噎廢食。亦所不取。因就憲草中猶待鄭重商榷之若干點。扼要一言。</p>
<p>（一）第四十七條關於國民大會代表之選舉。當改爲兼採職業代表制與區域代表制。其理由詳見下文（九）。</p>
<p>（二）［人民之權利義務章］各條。皆有［···非依法律不得···］及［···依法律有···］字樣。論者多以人民權利僅享法律的保障。缺乏憲法的保障爲憾。因謂不如在憲法中明定可以干犯民權之條件。較爲確實具體。吾人比閱訓政時期約法與吳經熊張知本二氏之憲稿。知張稿卽採取憲法的保障之原則。而約法與吳稿則否。張吳同爲憲草會之主幹。關於此點。見解懸殊。憲草從吳與約法。殆爲政府留一隨時限制民權之餘地。實則甚無謂耳。蓋民權縱蒙憲法的保障。政府仍可爲應付緊急事變。而宣布戒嚴。停止憲法。若在平時無端剝削民權。使爲非法。憲草豈爲獨裁暴君而設者。今姑退一步言。卽欲維持法律的保障之原則。最少亦須將第十一·十二·十三·十四·二十三·五條之［停止］二字删去。差與民權神聖之眞諦較爲接近。</p>
<p>（三）（甲）平均地權。爲實行民主主義兩大辦法之一。憲草開宗明義。定［中華民國爲三民主義共和國］。則平均地權在憲草中應佔極重要之位置。自不待言。然土地一語之涵義如何。經濟學家不一其說。吾人以爲在憲草中應下一確切定義。以免將來解釋之困難。今日所謂平均地權。當然須着意於［權］字。不能斤斤較量面積之均攤。但個人私有地面積。仍應有最高與最低之限度。憲草對於此點。亦未顧到。孫中山先生主張［耕者有其田］。人人不盡爲［耕者］。自不必人人有田。但由土地而來之收益。則以供諸公用爲指歸。因是國家應充分利用土地征稅稅率之伸縮。逐漸轉移土地所有權。使土地爲國有。然後再行社會化。此之謂［平均地權］。其入乎辦法。孫中山先生指明爲［照價徵稅］［照價收買］及［漲價歸公］等三項。憲草僅於後者有確實之規定（第二十七條）。其前二者僅於第二十四條留一糢糊之印象。第二十八條［扶植自耕農及自行使用土地人］云云。亦嫌與［耕者有其田］之理想相去太遠。（乙）第三章中受國家與政府之保護與扶助者。僅以農工爲限。其他生産事業之發展。則委之於民間（第三十一條）。自應參照吳稿第一百七十七條。張稿第一百六十六條而補充之。</p>
<p>（四）據憲草第五十一條。國民大會本有重大之權力。然時論中之表示失望者。咸謂其名不符實。一則因每三年集會一次。失之太長。再則因每次集會期以一個月爲限。失之太短。無如大會代表。全國每縣　選出一人。已有千八百餘人。連蒙藏及海外僑民代表約爲二千人左右。事實上又不能時時集會。會期亦甚難超過一個月以上。有人乃倡議補救辦法。减少代表名額。不妨每年集會一次。同時主張取消國民委員會。吾人對於减少代表名額之建議。深表贊同。但旣稱每年集會一次。會期當然不能延長至於一年。假定會期以六個月爲限。不可謂不長。奈在其他六個月之閉會期内。大會職權仍非由類似國民委員會者代行不可。蓋大會職權之行施。本有繼續性。不能以時期劃定也。吾人以爲必欲廢除國民委員會或其類似組織。不得不將國民大會改爲常年可以集會之機關。其代表每若干年改選一次。所難者。代表名額不能减少太多。致失民治眞意。譬如减少至於現定額之半已不能謂不多。而實際仍有千人左右。依然不便時時集會。故爲權衡利害輕重及顧全事實着想。惟有維持國民委員會。而縮小憲草第五十八條所賦予該會之職權。其尤要者。在將受理監察院彈劾行政院長案之權及受理立法院不信任行政院長案之權。一般歸諸臨時國民大會之手。如是則國民委員會之權力旣不至十分龐大。而復有如下條說明之優點。</p>
<p>（五）行政院長與各部各委員會分掌行政職權（第八十七條）。凡關於行政院之重要事務。莫不由行政會議决定（第九十條）。院長不過充會議之主席（第八十九條）。其對於各部長及委員會長之任免亦須依法律提請國民政府行之（第八十八條。）其對委員會接受立法院提出之不信任案及監察院提出之彈劾案時。行政院長便應去職（第八十六條）。各部長及委員會長則不負連帶之責任。由是觀之。在憲草中之行政院長。旣無如英法閣揆之威權。而獨受立法機關與監察機關之雙重裁制。其義務與職權。殊不均衡。五院院長中。惟行政院長無限定之任期。立法院與監察院對之行使不信任權與彈劾權。又各無絲毫之限制。夫憲法之活用。本當充分發揮其連環性。英語中所謂［制衡］關係Checksandbalances卽不外此義。故立法機關。因不滿於行政機關而投不信任票時。行政機關如認立法機關之决議與民意相反背。亦得解散之。而訴諸國民公意。反之。立法機關如無提出不信任案之權。則行政機關亦無解散之權。權利義務。猶如形影之相隨。而不可須臾離者。是以吾人主張憲草中可删除關於立法委員及監察委員任期三年之規定。凡不信任或彈劾行政院長案。槪歸臨時國民大會受理。如大會否决各該案時。立法院或監察院須卽行解散。由大會另選。接受各該案時。行政院長亦須去職。若是則立法院與監察院始有所顧忌。不敢隨便提出不信任案與彈劾案矣。但以上所述。係指行政院長不服不信任案與彈劾案而言。若行政院長不待國民大會之議决。自動引咎辭職。當然無庸再費手費。卽由新院長繼任便可。或者曰。如行政院長戀棧不去。時時召集臨時國民大會。時時辦理選舉。豈不繁瑣。答曰。集召臨時國民大會。比較全民投票。究屬輕易。且當輿論昌明時代。行政院長可以審察輿論向背。以定去留方針。如以我國無輿論爲言。則整個憲法皆不免於憑虚架空。一切無從談起。再者。吾人如必欲維持憲草現有條文之梗槪。不願十分改絃更張。則行政院長似可有三年任期。與其他各院長同。其因不信任或彈劾案成立而去職者。當爲例外論。假若國民委員會不受理不信任或彈劾案時。行政院長之任期。可規定自該時起算延長三足年。與新任命者同。按德國韋瑪憲法規定。國會可以三分之二之多數。提議罷免總統。總統卽應暫行停職。由國民投票公决。如票决維持國會原議。總統便須去職。另辦大選。否則國會自動解散。總統任期自票决日起。延長七足年。與新就任者同。法善意美。可以摹倣。據參預憲草之蘇松芬君言。憲草中之［總統無甚權力。而行政之權仍操之行政院院長。但恐權力過大。流於專横。乃有第九十六條第一項···與第八十六條第二項···之規定。以控制之］。然細觀全局布置。矯枉過正。亦所不取。</p>
<p>（六）據憲草第八十一條。司法院或考試院院長副院長在國民大會閉會期間。均因事故去職時。由總統提經國民委員會之同意。任命代理院長。但立法委員及監察委員未滿任期三年而去職時。應如何補充。遍閱憲草。未見明文。第五十八條第三項。監察院對於立委監委明明可提彈劾。而國民委員會接受彈劾時。被彈劾者竟可不援行政院長之例而去職。則毋寗加優對於立委監委之待遇。取消上項監察院彈劾字樣。立委監委如有重大過失。山兩院分别自行懲處卽可。</p>
<p>（七）（甲）憲草第七十七條。［中華民國人民年滿四十五歲者。得被選爲總統副總統。］夫以一國正副元首地位之隆重。而其當選資格乃遠不如國民委員及候補委員之嚴。似不可解。民國十二年憲法所定總統之資格爲［中華民國人民。年滿四十歲以上。享有公權。任居國内滿十年以上者。］張稿第六十二條。卽據此爲本。實較現草爲妥善。（乙）妨害民權之軍閥政治。不當使之復活。張知本氏嘗慨乎言之。其所草憲稿第六十二條但書云。［軍人退職未滿三年者。其當選（大德統）爲無效。］防微杜漸。語重心長。現草第一三五條。［軍人非解除軍職三年後。不得爲省長候選人。］意猶此也。何獨於總統而不然。（丙）据第九十八條。總統對於立法院之議决案。得於公布前提交復議。但提交復議之範圍。空以一原案之整個的部分爲限。或總統可以自由斟酌而决定。關係甚鉅。應作明白之規定。（丁）論者比憲草中之總統。爲伴食之官。陪嫁之婢。實則以此八字移贈副總統。乃更爲神似。蓋憲草中之副總統。除總統出缺外。毫無可辦之事。而據第五十八條第二項。居然尙有被監察院彈劾之可能。寗非滑稽。今日世界各國中之有副總統者。如美國與瑞士。其副總統皆有相當之職權。美國之副總統。兼充參議院長。雖爲掛名之職事。總有若干例行公事可辦。瑞士之副總統。爲聯邦委員會委員之一。兼爲管部部長。總統與副總統皆任期一年。慣例。總統滿任後。卽以副總統繼任總統。故瑞士副總統之職權。遠超美國副總統之上。更非我國憲草中之副總統所能比擬於萬一。吾人以爲國家副座必不能置諸尸位素餐之閒曹。故須給以相當之職事。不然。則寗如張稿不設副總統之爲愈。張稿云。［大總統因故不能行施職務時。由行政院院長代行之。］但代行期限當照現革第八十三條。［不不得逾六個月］耳。</p>
<p>（八）行政院院長與各部長及各委員會長之關係。應否爲責任内閣閣揆與閣員之關係。頗有注意之價值。憲草第九十六條。立法院對於［行政院］政治之設施及法律案之執行。認爲不當時。有提出質詢及不信任案之權。但第八十六條第一項。因國民委員會接受不信任案而去職者。僅爲［行政院長］一人。各部長委員會長不負連帶之責任。換言之。舉凡行政院政治之設施及法律案之執行。統由院長一人向立法院及國民委員會負責。但據第八十七條。行政院之行政職權。固由各部及各委員會所分掌。第九十條。行政院之重要事項亦槪由行政會議議决。行政會議由院長與各部長委員會長共同組織。院長不過充會議之主席而已。細閱上舉各條。頗覺行政院長之職權與責任。失其均衡。譬如外交事務。固爲行政院政治設施之一。設施不當。由行政院長獨尸其咎。而外交部長反可高枕無憂。寗得爲事理之平。吾人以爲各部長委員會長如不與行政院長負連帶責任。便須對行政院長負單獨直接之責任。準此。則第八十八條［提請國民政府］六字似當删去。</p>
<p>（九）（甲）憲草中之立法院。仍爲一院制。與十九世紀以來列國議會組織之通例不合。一院制之立法機關。對其自身錯誤。不易發見改除。縱有監察院之彈劾。亦不過爲事後之監察。不能爲事前之糾正。今日之頌揚兩院制者。謂其能防止立法機關之專横。減少立法草率之流弊。及調劑立法機關與行政機關間之劇烈衝突。凡此皆爲事實。不容否認。而况憲草第九十四條立法委員之標準。旣兼採職業代表制與區域代表制。更不能如由純職業代表組織之全俄蘇維埃大會。依然維持一院制而不改。將來廢除一院制採取兩院制後。卽由職業代表之立委組織上院。區域代表之立委組織下院。固可。但欲充分發揚職業代表制之優長。自當作釜底抽薪計。變更第四十七條國民大會代表之選舉法。使之兼採職業代表制與區域代表制。然後由職業代表舉出之立委。組織上院。由區域代表舉出之立委。組織下院。良以選舉立委兼採職業代表制。其利僅限於立法院。不如選舉國民大會代表時兼採職業代表制。其利可貫注於整個的政治機構中也。德國韋瑪憲法亦兼採職業代表制與區域代表制。惟在議會兩院外。另行組織中央經濟辽。世有稱之爲三院制者。憲草第三十一條。［勞資雙方應本恊議互利原則。發展生産事業。］但並無專爲謀勞資恊調之中樞機關如德之中央經濟院者。自爲美中不足。將來立法院之組織。究以兩院或三院爲最妥善。猶待研究。但一院制不及多院制。則爲吾人所敢言。（乙）立委監委之被選人。旣不限於國民大會代表。至少須有年齡之限制。</p>
<p>（十）據憲草第一零七條。公務員懲戒委員會隸屬於司法院。與現制同。但據二十年六月八日國府公布之［公務員懲戒法］第十一條。各院部會長官或地方最高行政長官。認爲所屬公務員有違法失職情事。應備文聲叙事由。連同證據。送請監察院審查。但對於所屬薦任職以下公務員。得逕送公務員懲戒委員會審議。同法第十條。監察院移送彈劾案之懲戒機關。視被彈劾人之地位。而分爲中央黨部監察委員會。國民政府。中央及各省公務員懲戒委員會。足見現行法律。並未採用凡彈劾案之審判權槪歸司法院之原則。時論中乃有以［一事權而專責成］爲理由。主張將彈劾案之審判權。一般歸諸監察院者。究竟公務員懲戒委員會。應隸屬於監察院或司法院。尙待愼重研究。</p>
<p>（十一）國民嚴格監督財政。爲肅清官邪防止貪污之一根本辦法。憲草第九十五條。議决預算權屬於立法院。第一二五條。决算之審查及審查後之公布權屬於監察院但吾人以爲預算議决案。當屬於國民大會。以示國民監督財政之至意。决算審計。應否維持憲草辦法。或由立法院與國民政府分任審計與公布之責。尙有討論餘地。</p>
<p>（十二）中央與地方之均權。以課稅權之適當劃分爲主要關鍵。故憲草第六十四條。似應加以補充。以列譽國家收入（如鹽稅，關稅，烟酒稅，印花稅等皆是。第二十九條第一項。規定所得稅及遺産稅歸國家徵收。卽其一例。）與地方收入。（如田賦，契稅，牙稅，等皆是。）爲上。訓政時期約法第六十二條。明定凡地方課稅有［妨害社會公共之利益］［妨害中央收入之來源］。［複稅］［妨害交通］［爲一地方之利害對於他地方貨物之輸入爲不公平之課稅］［各地方之物品通過稅］等六欵之弊端者。中央得以法律限制之。頗稱扼要。應加採納。庶幾實行後各地主濫行苛捐雜稅之惡習。可以滌除。</p>
<p>（十三）（甲）憲草第一三０條。省爲中央直接管轄之行政區域。而省長應向中央何人或何機關負責。並無明文。據第一三二條。省長仍爲間接民選。與縣長由縣民直接選舉。雖有直接與間接之分。其爲民選則一。據第一四七條。縣民有直接罷免縣長之權。則省民應有間接罷免省長之權。亦屬情理之所許。乃遍閱第八章各條。並無此種規定。果稿第一百二十八條第三項。與第一百三十三條。皆稱省民有間接罷免省長之權。較爲妥善。（乙）省長直接民選。更近於民主精神。</p>
<p>（十四）（甲）憲草第一四一條與一五０條。縣市民皆有依法行使罷免之權。但對於縣市議會職員應如何憲施其罷免權。實有注意之價值。似應在憲草中明定之。（乙）縣預算，决算，與審計事項。統屬於縣議會一機關。易滋流弊。應爲適當之劃分。（丙）第一四六條。縣長受省長之指揮。執行中央行政事預。假若縣長有不服省長指揮情事。省長無如之何。不過縣長而專對省長負責。則縣自治亦便失去實際之價值。今爲拆衷兩全起見。擬改爲縣長由縣民選舉三人。由省長圈定一人。</p>
<p>（十五）（甲）憲草第一五三條。仍採市長制。似不如市經理制之更合乎潮流。市經理當由市議會議决。就中央考試合格人員中聘任之。在市經理制下之市長。則由市議會議員互選。（乙）第一五四條。市長受監督機關之指揮。執行中央行政事務。此［監督機關］四字殊嫌糊糊。應明白指出以何機關負監督之責。</p>
<p>（十六）據憲草第一五六條。本憲法之解釋。由立法院擬具意見。提請國民大會或國民委員會决定之。蘇松芬君關於此條之解釋謂。猶恐國民大會與國民委員會。不易明暸解釋憲法之癥結所在。故主張先由立法院擬具意見。可見國民大會與國民委員會之行使解釋權。極易爲立法院所左右。以國家之立法機關。操解釋根本大法之實權。如立法違憲。將何從而糾正。此其流弊。無待深辦。吳稿主張設立國事法院。不惟憲法上之疑義。可由國事法院解釋。（二零條第一項）且更進一步。得審查違憲之法令。並宣告無效。（同條第二項）處分違憲之行爲。（同條第三項）解决其他直接或間接違背憲法布非普通通法院可得解决之政治上事件。（同條第九項）條文周密。至堪稱許。較諸美國大理院須經人民正式請求並有違憲事實爲對象而後作憲法疑義之解釋者。猶遠勝之。憲草不予採取。殊不澈底。（乙）憲草第一五八條。本憲法非由國民大會議决。不能修改。是則在國民大會閉會期間。卽不能有所修改。束縛太甚比較活動。可以借鏡。</p>
<p>（十七）出憲草中之各條之本身觀之。亦有不甚周密或不甚接筍之處。酌爲舉出如下。（甲）第五十一條第一項［制字］二字下。應加［解釋］二字。與第一五七條相呼應。（乙）第五十八條第三項。應改爲［···對於行政院院長及司法院···各院院長副院長］。（丙）第五十九條之前或後似應酌加［國民大會及國民委員會職權之行施以法律定之］一條。（丁）第八十六條第一二兩項。在［國民委員會］五字之上。應加［國民大會或］五字。不然在國民大會閉會期間。行政院長維經立法院監察院之不信任或彈劾。亦可安然無恐。（戊）第一四六條［縣長］二字下。應加［受省長之監督］六字。與第一三六條相呼應。（己）第一四八條［縣長之選舉］五字下。可加［罷免］二字。</p>

<h3>法德覆文送達倫敦軍縮意見懸隔</h3>
<p>法以危及國家安全婉拒英方案</p>
<p>德可重入國聯惟先求解决軍縮</p>
<p>英國調解徒勞無功</p>
<p>（倫敦）法德兩國之軍縮照會、均於今日送交英政府、</p>
<p>法國照會係於内閣通過後、由駐倫敦法大使轉交英當道、照會措詞極爲和緩、據稱如法國之安全不受威脅、則法國並不反對關於軍縮之原則、但不能接受英國計畫、蓋該計畫將允許德國有重置與法國平等軍備之權、且不保障法國之安全也、現所需要者、厥爲一種歐洲機關、以防止軍縮公約之被破壞、及防阻一切侵犯事項、</p>
<p>國聯惟一和平機關國聯爲能維持和平之唯一機關、設德國重行加入國聯、則可爲其忠誠之明證、而軍縮之討論、亦可繼續進行、德國破壞凡爾賽和約、重置軍備、而其對於戰具及武力之要求、又無一不與軍縮會所通過之議案原則相矛盾、法國固願接受英國取消全世界空軍之建議、但如若干國能得重置陸軍之容許、則海軍之擴充要求、必接踵而至云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）照會文中並堅持在比較各國軍力時、各種軍事性質之團體、無論携帶軍械與否、必須作正式軍隊論、據熟悉時勢者稱、此最後條欵之目的、係對［德國褐衫同志］及［意大利黑衫同志］而發、法國並鄭重聲明、除最近努力建設一集團、卽所謂法蘭西黨外、法國以前並未有類似此種性質團體之行動云、然卽以最近之法蘭西黨論、亦無進展之可言、自法國送交倫敦之照會表示對德之態度後、英國官塲深以爲異、因法意兩國關於德國要求增加軍備已有正式之恊定也、衆信意法恊定表示法國之相當讓步、法國以爲如德國並不增加其［攻擊用之軍備］、則法國對於德國保持相當防禦用之軍備、表示並不反對云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>德國照會係答覆二月十五日法國否决德國所有要求之備忘錄者、其措詞亦極温和、據稱、德國深信和諧有其先决之條件、而所需者厥爲决心、法國對於某數點似有誤會云、又謂德國與國聯關係之問題、在軍縮問題一經解决後、卽可加以討論、德國相信有兩種辦法可以成立恊定者、卽成立五年軍備休戰恊定、或成立時間較長的局部軍縮計畫之恊定云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>德覆法牒全文</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國答復法國之軍縮備忘錄復文、已於三月十三日遞交法國駐德大使、其全文至今日始行發表、内容大意如下、二月十四日法國之備忘錄中所稱、曾發現德法兩政府對於軍縮問題之若干要點、意見各有不同、然兩國政府固莫不欲望軍縮會議之能早日召集、以便繼續交換對此問題之意見、德國政府對於法國之備忘錄、延緩答復、實因當時英政府正開會討論、徵求各國政府對此問題之意見、德國謹在此表示謝意、因在此局勢之下、德政府祗得靜候此項會議之結果、以資採納也、</p>
<p>要求消除誤會四點　德政府以爲法國備忘錄中所宣稱各項、恐係對於德國前此所發宣言有所誤會、在將來之會議席上、殆將引起重要之注意深望届時可將各種誤會一律消除之、其誤會之事項、約分爲下列四點、（一）法國政府對於德國一月十九日所發備忘錄未全明瞭、德國所提［不侵犯條約］之意、與［羅卡諾］條約之原旨不謀而合、德政府對此點之答復、業於新德意志之外交政策中明白宣示、又一月二十六日德國波蘭二國之共同宣言中、亦經堅决表示、在任何局勢之下、德國决不求助於武力　因此之故、德政府今謹正式聲明、一俟軍縮問題正式解决之後、届時德國將開始與列强討論德國與國聯之將來關係云云、（二）法國備忘錄强稱德國之提議、乃基於錯誤之觀察、蓋德政府以爲有效之軍縮、在今日爲不可能云云、今德政府謹正式宣稱、目今軍備充盛之各國整軍經武、絶無限制本國軍備之添設、且未曾有任何軍縮提案、其誠决實遠不如德國、其尤足注意者、法政府迄未有任何進行之提案、以促成軍縮之實現、而德國未來之軍備限度、則卽於一九三二年十二月經五列强之宣言中、加以制定矣、（三）法政府對於一月十日德國備忘錄中所稱監督問題之批評、實仍基於誤會、德國建議設立國際監督一項、其目的無他、卽各國之軍事設備、必須使之平衡而已、此種軍備之監督、祗須製定規約、絶無困難、故德國深望此種軍備之監督、必須使之實現也、</p>
<p>（四）關於德國政黨之組織、德政府以爲此種組織絶無軍事上之意味、然而法政府對此、又有異議、似此不妨制定一種條規、藉以取締其他各國之政黨、以爲然乎德政府認取締政黨實無甚必要、法政府可無庸多費猜疑、德决不至甘冒大不韙、以暴力壓迫軍縮會、然後再採用武力也、該復文除解釋誤會各點外、最後又指出兩點、謂將來德國之軍隊卽將配置以自衛之兵器、又稱列强之擁有海外屬地者、其軍隊隨時可召回母國應戰故此種軍備之數量、在比較下實欠平衡云、最後又稱俟軍縮會開會時、德國將提出一最低限度之自衛軍備提案云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>贊同軍備普遍限制　備忘錄内又稱、德國對於軍縮之普遍限制、卽除正式軍隊外、禁止設立各種武裝團體或類似之武裝團體、表示同意、然備忘錄中之某一節、暗示德國仍堅持設立常備軍三十萬人、此種常備軍亦卽德國國會以前所要求者、備忘錄繼稱、在將來比較法德兩國軍力時、對於法國國内軍隊及法國殖民地之軍隊、均須加以考慮云、茲德國以哀的美敦書式之詞句、要求准許德國充份設備自衛用之軍備、並稱、此種要求不能再事延宕、或加以無謂之討論、</p>
<p>主張召集兩種會議　備忘錄關於世界軍縮問題、則建議召集兩種連續式的會議、第一會議、則限止各充足軍備之國家、其軍備在五年内、不得超過現狀、第二會議包括之年限較長、將謀列强現有軍備之實際裁减、據稱、吾人所欲者實爲第二會議、然第一會議因其簡單與實際上易爲各國所接受而成立恊定也、無論在第一會議或第二會議中、德國建議之軍備增加、則始終不變、此節德國於備忘錄中曾再三申言之、</p>
<p>暗示可望重入國聯　在政治上　　觀察、則照備忘錄中提及國聯一節、爲德國增加軍備要求達到滿意時、重新加入國聯之表示、自德國退出國聯後、從未傳佈重入國聯之消息、有之、則自此次始云、（十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本竟公然撕毀國際貿易公約</h3>
<p>確保通商自由爲理由</p>
<p>廣田向國聯宣告從此不受拘束</p>
<p>（東京）日英政府爲確保對外商權起見、已向本届議會提出通商擁護法案、現爲强化此項計畫、業由廣田外相於十七日對於日内瓦國際議日本事務局代理局長横山氏發出通告、［謂日本政府欲將禁止限制或撤廢出口進口之條約義務從此解除、囑將此意轉達國聯事務總長、其訓令之大要、據外務省聲明如左、</p>
<p>日本政府爲打開世界經濟難局、促進世界繁榮起見、决將阻害國際通商之一切障碍盡行除去、以圖恢復世界貿易、並確信此項緊要計畫爲不可忽視、而希望各國之經濟恊力更臻緊密、以便舉其共存共榮之實、以此希望爲原則、恢復國際通商之自由爲目的、故曾參加前項條約及其决議、現今世界各國均處於經濟困難之秋、更無暇慮及大局、乃徒走於自己本位之政策、近則此種傾向愈形增大、故不得不脫離該項條約及其决議、蓋勢所必至也、日本對於該項條約之參加雖欲繼續、而世界通商自由、非獨不足以資確保、現今各國擅自提高關稅、禁止外貨進口、增大通商上之障碍、因此日本出口貿易蒙莫大之影響、最近對於關係各國作抵制日貨之對抗措置、其遺憾之點、歷歷可陳、其於貨幣及經濟會議、目下亦處於無期休會之狀態、是以日本政府現爲保護利益計、决將認爲必要之一切措置恢復其自由、而實行與該項决議脫離關係也、聞宣告脫離後、經過一月卽當發生效力云、（十八日日聯電）</p>

<h3>羅馬協定簽訂後奥不啻瑞士第二</h3>
<p>意大利睥睨中歐</p>
<p>奥獨立獲得保障</p>
<p>羅馬　意奥匈三國恊定之主要影響、爲束縛奥國、必先商諸意國、而後始可作抛棄其獨立如與德國聯盟等事之任何舉動、雖在事實上未發請書分致他國、邀其加入此恊定、但此約之公開性質、固甚顯明也、而在政治方面、其恊商條文尤爲諷令各國尊重奥國獨立之明白表示、使奥國一變而爲第二瑞士、此爲保障意國安全之一大步驟、故昨日所簽定之三角恊定、在羅馬人士觀之、乃意相墨索里尼政策之勝利、蓋意相欲阻止任何一國或若干國支配中歐也、公約雖定午後四時簽字、但約文謄錄需時、故遲至五時零八分始畫諾焉、</p>
<h3>約文有三</h3>
<p>未幾公報發表、謂簽定者有三約、第一約規定三國元首担任在與彼等有關之各特殊問題上及一般問題上、彼此提携行事、以遵行目的在增進歐洲各國尤其是意匈奥三國間有效力的合作之政策、三國確信如此可植立與他國大合作之眞正地步、其他兩約擴大意國與匈奥現有之商約、以便利相互的輸出、並發展其國家之經濟、又規定（一）對於奥國工業出品之優惠待遇、（二）成立補救匈國因穀價低落而起的困難之計畫、（三）發展經過亞德利亞海口岸之運輸交通、</p>
<h3>細則待商</h3>
<p>三國代表將於四月五日集議於羅馬、各專家對於商品之優待與限額、奥匈在［特利斯特］與［阜姆］之自由區域、及三國間付欵之辦法、現正商酌詳則、此種雙方面的新恊定、須在五月十五日以前完成、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>簽字折筆</h3>
<p>羅馬　此次簽約係在威尼斯宮中、當簽字時、貢氏之筆忽斷、墨氏遂爲之筦爾隨卽授以他筆、始完成其簽字、據聞三約中之政治公約、實與中歐各國之政局有極重大之關係、其他關於經濟之兩公約、則爲意國與匈奥之貿易恊定、其中規定意國對於奥國之實業出品、及匈國之麥産出口、皆予以特别之［關稅優惠待遇、］至奥匈兩國之商品經由［特利斯特］及［阜姆］兩埠者、則將儘量助之發展、此項公約實爲墨氏避免世界列强之大規模結合而出此、據墨氏云、此次成績、極爲圓滿云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>上賓凱旋</h3>

<h3>墨索里尼重要外交演說</h3>
<p>中歐政策成功發表睦鄰意見</p>
<p>藐視軍縮抱有伸展勢力雄心</p>
<p>羅馬　墨索里尼對未來衆院之候選議員發表演說、力言汎繫主義之具體價值、旋研究意大利與各鄰國之關係、</p>
<h3>意瑞</h3>
<p>謂渠凖備將一九二四年意大利與瑞士所訂條約、予以延長、</p>
<h3>意奥</h3>
<p>並稱意大利必能援助奥國、以保障其獨立、改良其經濟、</p>
<h3>意塞</h3>
<p>至於意大利與南斯拉夫關係、在外交上尙無瑕疵、如加以經濟上利益、則兩國國交或更能改善、第兩國問題、須俟必要之條件實現以後、始能加以考慮、</p>
<h3>意法</h3>
<p>意大利與法國之一般關係、業已改善、惟意法兩國各種問題、無一得到解决者、不過兩國關係在精神上旣已改善、則日後國交之發展、自較容易、</p>
<h3>意匈</h3>
<p>墨索里尼謂、［匈牙利之土地、有實爲馬志牙人種、（卽匈牙利人）之土地而被人剝奪者、］匈牙利眷懷故土之情、意大利深能了解、羅馬最近所簽之議定書、可由其他國家參加、爲廣泛之合作、簽字國家並不拒絶、</p>
<h3>國聯</h3>
<p>首相旋主張國聯會當加以改造、但謂須於軍縮會議成功之後、始可行之、蓋軍縮會議之主要目標、現已着着落空、若不幸而而完全失敗、則此種改造似可不必、因軍縮會議失敗於前、再令國聯會破産於後、實覺無益也、再違反凡爾賽條約而武裝之各國、如不從事裁軍、則渠等卽不能反對軍備平等權之適用於德國、吾人旣不能以强力阻止德國重行武裝、則吾人對於德國重整軍備及擴充軍額之要求、卽當予以承認、比利時總理勃洛克維爾之演說可爲徵象、</p>
<h3>軍縮</h3>
<p>至於意大利在軍縮途徑上不能再行前進、因軍縮會議現已陷於僵局、意大利有保衛國家之神聖義務、故必須使其兵力强大、但其目的在於應付一切事變、而不在攻擊他人也、</p>
<h3>對其他民族</h3>
<p>墨相結論謂意大利與其他民族、誠意合作、實足以維繫和平、以地理上地位而論、意大利爲完全島國、但意大利對於地中海、對於菲洲、及亞洲、均有其前途、有其歷史上之目標、特其所求者、不在侵略土地、而在推廣文化、發逹經濟耳云云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>孫總理思想與人格（續）</h3>
<p>｜蔣在總理逝世紀念席上演詞｜</p>
<p>第八、［民生主義與共産主義、目的相同、而哲學的基礎和實行的方法、完全不同、先生說、共産主義是民生主義的理想、民生主義是共産主義的實行、又說、馬克思是社會病理學家、不是社會生理學家、這四句話、是研究民生主義的人最要注意的格言、］這一條是將民生主義與共産主義的異同、依總理所告訴我們的格言、作最精要的叙述、從前共産黨就是拿了總理所講［民生主義就是共産主義］一句話、斷章取義來騙人、丢了總理所講［共産主義是民生主義的理想民生主義是共産主義的實行］這兩句格言不講、我們看看這兩句話、就可以曉得總理的眞意是認定共産主義和民生主義最後目的雖相同、但哲學基礎和實行方法不同、民生主義乃以民生哲學爲主義、以節制私人資本、發展國家資本、平均地權、及調和社會各階級利益使能互相合作的恊力同進、爲實行的方法、出於［忠孝仁愛信義和平］的精神、共産主義、乃以機械的唯物論爲基礎、以階級鬥爭無産階級專政、卽殺人放火等種種不正當的非文明人類所應有的種種手段來實行、發於嫉忌·仇恨·殘酷·報復的心理、試問以這種非文明人類所應有的手段、如何可以達到共産目的而實現民有·民治·民享·的大同世界呢、共産主義提倡階級鬥爭、要自相殘殺、試問人都殺光了、還有甚麽共産主義大同社會好講呢、他的主義、要使人類互相殘殺、這是多麽殘酷多麽野蠻、所以我們要眞現實共産主義建設大同世界、就是要實現總理的民生主義、打破馬克斯的假共産主義、</p>
<p>第九、［先生的全人格、乃以仁愛爲基礎、一切表現、無不仁愛、有過人之智、而其智推用於和仁、有過人之勇、而其勇惟用於行仁、可知離却仁愛、絶無革命可言、民生爲宇宙大德之表現、仁愛卽民生哲學的基礎、其他一切道德、皆不外由此而生、完成仁愛之用而已、］這最後一條、就是由總理基本思想講到偉大革命的人格、卽拿仁愛兩個字來指明總理本革命人格的根基和一切表現的總動機與總目標、我們曉得、總理和人家寫字、最常寫的、就是［博愛兩個字、［博愛之謂仁］、所以總理常高興寫、我們由這件事可以體察總理平日對人對己、治國平天下的一切行爲、無不是基於仁愛、人人都曉得、總理有過人之智、但是只用於知仁、人人都曉得、總理有過人之勇、他與一切反革命奮鬥到底、數十年如一日、那一個的勇氣也不及總理、但是總理過人之勇、只用於行仁、只是用以對付反革命的人、卽爲實行仁愛的主義、不惜自己犧牲、也不遑顧及其他的一切、所以我們個個同志、要曉得總理革命的全人格和全生命、就是種基於仁爱、而成其崇高偉大與仁愛、各位同志、更要曉得我們革命是爲甚麽、用一句話來講、革命就是要行仁愛於天下、除此以外、再無革命可言、因爲革命就是救國救民、使不平等的世界打成平等之最大的仁愛事業、所以革命絶非爭權奪利殺人放火、必其有大仁愛的思想植基於仁愛之最大革命人格的人、才能眞正革命、</p>
<p>以上已經將民生哲學係統說明所包含的、向大家解析過了、至於原表現在因爲時間不够、不能完全向大家解釋、只能就幾句重要的話、卽表的中心意義、來講一講、</p>
<p>原表的表心說、［天下之達道三、民族也、民權也、民生也、所以行之者三、智仁勇也、智仁勇三者、天下之達德也、所以行之者一也、一者何、誠也、誠也者、擇善而固執之者也、這一段、是說天下可以行得通的大道、只有三條、卽民族·民權·民生、人類社會　切問題、都可歸結這三項、古今天下的學術文化、都是要來解决這三個問題、總理的三民主義、就是古今中外　切學術思想的結晶、就是解决人類社會問題最妥當的方法總理的三民主義卽民族·民權·民生·三條、要如何才能實行、這就是我們每一個人尤其是每一個革命黨員、要具備三種可以行通的德性、所謂智仁勇三種達德、必須具此智仁勇三種德性、才能行得通民族民權民生三條大道、所以說［智仁勇者、天下之達德也］這三種德性、乃現代國民人人所應有、亦爲我們民族所固有、如果人家要問我們民族固有的基本德性是什麽、我們可以回答他、中國民族固有德性　就是智仁勇亦可說是總理所講的［忠孝仁愛信義和平、］一個人如果没有這種德性、更不配做一個現代國民、尤其不配做一個革命黨員、怎樣才能有智仁勇三種達德呢、比方講我們有勇氣去隨便打人殺人、這固是一種勇、但不是智仁勇之眞［勇］、因爲他雖勇而不仁不智、眞的勇一定要智而仁的［勇］卽是要爲救國救民而犧牲一切去作最有效的奮門、同樣［仁］也是一定智而且勇的［仁］、不是煦煦爲［仁］、［孑孑爲義、］更不是假仁假義、［智］一定要［仁而且勇］的智、故［見義不爲］、［知而不仁］、或以自己聰明才力不用於［行仁］、甚至用於［不仁］或［作僞］的一方面那種智統統是假的、甚至危害人類社會的所以智仁勇三達德、及人人所應同時具備不可缺一、必然如此、才可以貫通一致以完成革命的人格、一個人要如何才能充實智仁勇三達德而完成完美的革命人格、這就是要有一種基本的前提和精神的動力、卽所謂［誠］、誠就是凡事要誠心誠意、一心一德來實實在在的做、一切作爲不好有一點虚僞、至善的心志、自始至終不好有　點動摇無論古今中外、凡有大智大勇能成立大功大業的人、莫不由此、能誠、便一切可以成功不誠、便無論什麽事也做不好、所以說［誠者成也、］［誠者物之終始不誠無物、］我們要走通民族·民權·民生·三條達道、一定要具備智仁勇三種達德、</p>
<p>德、要具此三種達德而充溢發揮以成大功立大業、必先能［誠］、誠卽是［一］、一心一德、始終如一、所以說［智仁勇三者、天下之達德也、所以行之者一也、一者何、誠也］、</p>
<p>最後、再要講到如何才能誠、如何才能做到始終如一、就是要［擇善而固執之］卽要選定一個最好的道理或事物、牢牢把握、自始至終能遵守、竭力篤行、非使這個至善道理發現、至善的事物做成不止、如不做到、卽犧牲於此、我們現在要革命、第一要緊的、就是要選擇一個最好的主義終身服膺·信守·誠心·誠意·實行、犧牲一切、貫澈始終、我們要時時刻刻自勉自策　時時戒𢣷、否則便不足以言革命、更没有成功希望、比方講、現在的主義很多、有三民主義、共産主義、有無政府主義、以及其他各種主義如果我們不擇善而固執之、今天聽說三民主義好、便信仰三民主義、明天聽說共産主義好、便信仰共産主義、再過一天、聽說無政府主義好又去信奉無政府主義、這樣還能有成功的希望嗎、運算是一個革命的人嗎、所以我們要做一個革命的人、首先要選定　一種最好的主義誠心誠意來堅信篤行、始終不變、現在最後救國救民救世的革命主義、就是總理的三民主義、要我們革命成功、就只有誠心誠意堅信三民主義、而一心一德來實行、不許對三民主義有一點懷疑、有一點批評、只有照着總理所講的話實實在在去做、絶對不是說今天信仰　三民主義而以後不信或心寰想、并且口裏講三民主義而手裏不行、一定要想到講到實在做到、並且至死不變、如此、才能算是總理眞實信徒、才配做一個革命黨員、才可以實行三民主義、完成中國革命、我們現在做了三民主義的信徒　每一個星期舉行總理紀念週、每　年今天要來紀念總理逝世、對於總理學說的淵源和基本思想之所在、以及總理偉大革命的人格、必須有深切確當的認識、才能堅定三民主義的信心、勵進革命人格修養、所以我今天在紀念總理逝世的時候、特别將總理的民生哲學·及其崇高偉大的革命人格、向各位同志講明、希望大家從此能注意研究體認、從此而身體力行、誠心誠意專做一個總理的眞正信徒、實行總理的三民主義、］（完）</p>
<h3>山東經濟破産驚人數字</h3>

<h3>救濟方法</h3>
<p>本省現正在努力救濟經濟破産、决定最近擬一具體計劃、逐步實行、按山東每年産棉約二百四十萬擔、中國全國需用棉花約一千萬擔　而全國産棉只六百萬擔尙不敷四百萬擔、仰給於外國、如政府能用適當辦法、對於棉花種子之改良、組織合作社、使生産者與工廠、直接交易、增加棉花产額至一千萬擔、供給全國紗廠之需要、自可挽回漏𢨴、再山東之煤、出口及由津浦路運往上海等地、每年共約二百萬噸、假若採統制政策、改良煤礦、將出煤　别等次、使出口能增加一倍、如增加一百萬噸、最少卽增加收入一千萬元、關於布疋設法用濟南各紗、廠所出之紗織染印好、到各縣農村並膠濟路沿綫、以抵抗外布傾銷、假若能抵制外布一半、卽可挽回漏𢨴一萬萬元、其餘烟業、根本改良種烟及薰烟、由政府在濟南設一大烟工廠、用本省土産烟業、製成捲烟、用政治力量、到各縣推銷、縱不能將外烟完全抵制假若能替代外烟三分之　、卽可挽回漏𢨴一千萬元、此外努力改良舊工業、組織新工業、開發富源、預料數年之後、不惟能救濟經濟農村、且工商業亦可逐漸發達云云、（十六日）</p>

<h3>飛行社籌備處昨成立</h3>
<p>＝提倡民間對於航空興趣＝</p>
<p>＝簡單方法造就飛行人材＝</p>
<p>＝期推廣社會上航空常識＝</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>飛行家孫桐崗·毛邦初·聶開一·　等爲倡導民衆發展航空起見、特發起組織上海飛行社、自籌備迄今、已將數月、因備案手續尙未完竣、爰先在呂班路一七七弄九號（航空恊會内）成立籌備處、一俟手續辦妥後、卽行正式宣佈成立、茲將該社發起經過、分誌於次、</p>
<h3>建設航空救亡出路</h3>
<p>［一二八］之役、國人痛心於敵人之利用空軍蹂躪我國土、殘殺我同胞、乃有反而求之於己之决心、蓋知敵之敢於侵我领空、如入無人之境者、何莫非因我空軍薄弱、無與週旋之能力耳、於是憂時之土、遂以［無航空卽無國防］一語、互相警策、而總理航空救國之遺訓、亦幾於家喻户曉、至舉國上下、遂咸認建設航空、爲我國救亡維一之出路、雖然、建設航空、千頭萬緒、若募欵購置飛機、製造飛機、培養人材、從事地面設備等、旣非可以成立於一日、又豈得盡責政府一方、獨負艱鉅、是則羣策羣力、政府與民衆統同合作尙矣、夫中國航空恊會之創立、卽所以應此種潮流之要求而起、使政府與人民、得一合作之中心也、</p>
<h3>購置飛機贈送政府</h3>
<p>中國航空恊會成立於去年元旦、當時卽開始爲宣傳運動、並决定從一月廿三日起至一月廿八日爲航空救國運動週、全國各界羣起響應、尤以上海一埠爲𤍠烈、旋由常務理事會議定航空恊會進行綱領、分期辦理、當决定先就上海募欵、購置飛機贈送政府、再進一步、自設敎練飛行機關、造就駕駛人材、特有餘力、乃提倡集資創辦飛機製造廠、募欵購機與造就人材兩項、實爲該會首先所最注意者也、自去年三月起開始募欵、公推上海市吳市長爲徵求隊總隊長、在吳市長領導之下、不數月已集基金百萬、破前此未曾有之紀錄、乃由該會商請中央政府及航空署審察國防之需要、選擇飛機之種類、並請代爲定購、此去年秋夏之間、該會所以有購戰鬥機十八架、贈送政府之舉也、</p>
<h3>各方注意造就人材</h3>
<p>至於造就人材之計劃、當時亦經常務理事會議决着手籌備、並推林秘書長我將擬定飛行社設計書、卽經常務理事會通過原則、推派林君我將前往杭州、與航空署長接洽、借用航空署上海飛機塲爲飛行社敎練飛行之用、又商借航空學校敎練機數架、均蒙當局允許借用、卒因該會定購飛機欵額超過募得之基金、致無餘欵、足供飛行社開辦費之用、遂不得不暫行擱起、但數月以來、各方對於該會訓練人才之計劃、極爲注意、紛紛來函、詢問飛行社組織之近狀、其中或爲抱𤍠血救國之青年、願獻身航空界報國、而求入社練習飛行者、或爲社會領袖關心造就航空人才者、如本埠杜月笙·吳藴初·諸先生、願以敎練機贈送飛行社、以促其成者是也、而允許於飛行社確可望成立時願贊助開辦費及經常費者、亦不一而足、</p>
<h3>航界前輩均表贊許</h3>
<p>至於航空界前輩、如中委陳慶雲·張惠長·諸氏、聞本會有飛行社之籌備、均深表贊許、而航空當局徐署長培根·毛副校長邦初·等、雖各專心於軍事航空之編練、未遑顧及、惟對於民間飛行訓練之創設、均極表同情、視爲有利我國航空發展之企圖、最近我國青年飛行家孫桐崗君、從德國長途飛航回國、於此次完成全國飛行之後過滬、得悉本會飛行社籌備之近况、力促早日成立、並許願犧牲其寳貴之光陰精神爲提倡、且以敎練飛行員自任、至是該會同人以旣得各方之贊助、雖經費尙未籌足、若不乘機積極籌備以促其成、更待何時、此飛行社籌備經過情形之大槪、及此次宣告籌備處成立之原因也、</p>

<p>據該會秘書長林我將對新新社記者談、飛行社之意義及創設之必要云、飛行社一名飛行俱樂部、其設立之目的、在提倡使民間對於航空事業發生興趣、並於實際方面以比較的經濟及簡單方法、造就飛行人材、所以定名爲飛行社、而不依原來西文之（FlyingClub）飛行俱樂部者、蓋恐引起民衆之誤會、以謂此頂組織與普通之俱樂部性質相同、主要目的、在消遣娛樂而已、實則此種創設寓有深意、一方面固爲實施敎練飛行技術、爲國儲備飛機駕駛人員、一方面則因其爲民間之組織無軍事關係、得以公開、使羣衆能隨時參觀、以期推廣社會上航空常識、今日談航空救國、勢必使大衆先有航空認識爲要、卽西人之所謂［航空頭腦］是也、歐美各强國、此項組織、已甚普遍、且推行至於其殖民地、其間尤以英國爲最特色、（有飛行俱樂部五十二個）若印度·（已設六處）新加坡·香港·均於近年創設飛行俱樂部多處、夫以吾國之大、辦航空亦已二十餘年、至今猶未見設立一飛行俱樂部、是值不如列强之殖民地矣、擁有三百萬市民居全國領導地位之上海市、宜乘此時贊助、使上海市飛行社早日實現、本會成立之宗旨、旣在倡導民衆發展航空、則除進行籌欵及宣傳之外、應進一步爲實際之工作、辦學校、設工廠、均爲要着、而創設飛行社、因其比較的易入手、且收效迅速、尤須先行舉辦、以期提起民衆之注意、此後籌欵之進行、亦將因民衆航空興趣濃厚、而益樂爲捐輸也、吾人觀於日本帝國飛行恊會其昭和七年度（一九三二）之預算、用於實際提倡民間航空及宣傳欵項者、爲九萬六千金元、便知最近日本民衆對於捐［愛國號］飛機至百餘架之多、皆因該恊會平日能實際提倡而收良美結果也、</p>

<h3>極度衰落之本市絲織業近况調查</h3>
<p>織機九千餘台僅剩二千五百台</p>
<p>歇業踵接勉强維持者亦减工資</p>
<p>我國絲織業、自滬戰以來、市面極度衰落、綢之售價、已跌至成本之下、本市織機九千餘台、絡續關閉、僅剩二千五百餘台、勉强維持、各廠均减低工資、藉維現狀、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>極度衰落　絲織廠出口綢緞、輸往國外南洋·印度·等處、每年出口額約一千八百萬兩之鉅、自民國二十二年及二十一年、我國政府兩次加征人造絲進口稅後華綢成本過重、與南洋·印度·等處所銷之日貨、勢難競賣、又受世界經濟影響、以致華綢出口、逐漸减少、迄今全年總數、僅及十分之二、國内因農村經濟破産、銷路亦銳减、綢之售價、已跌至成本以下、</p>
<p>逐漸關閉　綢業衰落後、滬杭絲織廠無法維持、宣告倒閉者、前後相繼、以本市而言、原有織機九千餘台、自民國二十年起、逐漸關閉、至去年四月間、僅剩四千七百八十五台、旋因市面衰落、銷路益滯、至今年二月底止、祗剩二千五百餘台、較前僅及十分之三、此二千五百台中、猶以美亞廠佔其半數、</p>
<p>减低工資　勉强維持之二千五百台機各廠認爲不景氣之原因雖多、但工價之大、實爲最大癥結、曾經上海市電機絲織廠業同業公會開會議决、减低工資標凖數、由各廠酌量本廠狀况、减低工資、如寳華·裕村·萬寳·恒豐·錦新·美亞·總廠曁所屬各分廠工人、因减低工資、影響生計、羣起反對、幸蒙市社會局市黨部等竭力調解、除美亞外、恒豐萬寳等廠、均已告解决、</p>
<p>戰字第三二七九號批開、呈悉所稱海盜猖獗、破壞漁業等情、自屬事實、惟請將海上緝捕機關一律歸併各節、與行政權限、尙多出入、未便照辦、仰候令行江浙兩省府及海軍部、嚴飭所屬妥商軍警聯防切實辦法、認眞勦捕可也、此令、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀書癮</h3>
<p>讀書指導</p>
<p>讀了上次你們的讀書方法論的討論後，使我約略的知道了些讀書技術，不過我還有一個問題要請你們指敎。</p>
<p>說來也很慚愧，我是抱着决心要讀書的，因此我預先立了程限，規定了時間，預備了書籍，但是實際上却不知怎的，總没有照原來計畫做去。到了規定的讀書時間時，臨時總要發生變故，不肯讀書。譬如我是規定晚上七點　開始讀書，到十點鐘爲止的，但是到了七點鐘有時忽然覺得身體育點疲倦，希望再休息一刻然後再讀書，然而休息又休息，精神還是打不起來，而讀書時間差不多消磨了一半，於是索性把心一横書明日讀罷，今天還是鋪床睡覺，休養一下；有時精神雖則不疲倦，但是總覺得環境不好，不是嫌燈光不亮，就是恨椅子坐着太不舒服。······以及其他等等。一言以蔽之，在日裏做事時，總規决定今天晚上要讀什麽書，但到了晚上，原來計畫很少能實現。不過，先生，你不要誤會，我的不能照預定時間讀書，其變故並不是全是發生於事前，不時也凖時去讀，但是把書翻了幾頁，毛病却來了，吃飽了飯，肚子脹，吃少了，又覺得餓，但是假如我不去讀書做别的事的話，這些毛病却决不會産生的。先生，請你不要笑我，這不是我没有决心讀書，我决定不讀書上床睡覺之後，心上漸愧得很，常常自恨没有毅力，勇氣，並且希望以後能夠降除這些妖魔的纒擾，但是一日復一日，這些妖魔始終没有降除，却反而使我精神上異常痛苦。先生，這是什麽原故，可有辦法解救麽？假如不能，我以後是索性老老實實的，不再去轉讀書念頭了。我盼望你能給我一個滿意的回答，使我不致失望。（鄭介伯來信）</p>
<p>鄭君這種毛病，確是一般人所常犯的，說來並無漸愧。不過它却很難醫治，然也並不是不能醫治。祇須研究出病源，事實上並非毫無辦法。這種毛病所以發生，依照編者個人的經騐，（因爲我也曾犯過）大致是因··（一）心大雜不能寗靜下來；（二）没有養成讀書的習慣；（三）操作忙碌，餘暇時間亟待休息，實不能再讀書；（四）讀書没有忍耐心；（五）讀書環境（包括個人生理上及周遭事物）不適合等等。但上面這些還不過是次要原因，其主原因是我們雖則頗喜讀書，但這祇是一種空洞的願望，還不是因讀書的結果而願意讀書。用句通俗的話說，就是讀書還没有上癮。上了讀書癮的人他是時時刻刻都想讀書的。譬如你現在要讀書，無非是想多懂得一些，多知道一些，至於所要懂得的對象是什麽，還是很糢糊，因此，這祗是一種空空洞洞的願望，不能算作讀書的迫切的動機，但是如果你是讀經濟學、讀了一本伊利編的［經濟學大綱］，自以爲已懂了經濟學是什麽，但後來要想更進一步。又買了本河上肇著的［經濟學大綱］讀了，這是你就發生了問題，這兩本書都是經濟學，但内容爲什麽會逈然不同呢？究竟那一本說明對呢？這樣，你心中便發生了問題，但是，在這時，問題雖則産生，却不會使你灰心，反而會提高你的研究慾求知慾。這問題放在你心中，好像一塊大石頭，你非得想法去搬開這塊石頭不可。但是如何去搬呢，要搬就非再作進一步的研究不可，換句話說，就非多讀書不可。以後書愈讀多，興趣也就愈濃，這就呌做上癮，與麻雀癮，鴉片癮，電影癮之［上］是一樣的，都是由習慣造成的。</p>
<p>這固然是主要原因，但是上述的讀書的次要原因，却也常能影響到你，使你不能讀書。你是規定七至十時讀書的，或許你還在這個規定再加上一個堅固的保障，卽是在這個時間，無論什麽事你都决計不做的。但是你一到了讀書時間，或者你讀了幾頁書之後，忽然心血來潮，想到剛剛同另外一個男子在一起跑的似乎是你的愛人，這樣你的注意力便决計不能再放在書本上，不能再去研究商品和貨幣（假如你讀到河著經濟學二十一頁）了，却要去估計，推測，你的愛人對你是否忠實。所以心太雜是决計不能讀書的。同樣，疲倦，和讀書環境等也都能影響到你的讀書。這種影響也很大，並且克服辦法也很多，這種辦法這裏不能詳述，好在他們已有專書說明，我現在但把那書介紹給你，就可以，那種書是··鄭譯，商務版的［修學效能增進法］。</p>
<p>但是鄭君或許要問，就是我們雖則讀書環境等的一切外圍或内在障礙都除去了，恐怕也未見得卽能讀書罷！因爲没有讀書癮的人，怎樣上癮呢？那我可以這樣回答他‘［你可以學學抽香烟或鴉片烟的上癮辦法。］初次抽香烟的人常會感覺到頭痛，但是他還要去抽，抽得時候一久，就上癮了。初讀書也是一樣的，他常常會感覺到讀書的痛苦，如書太難呀，不能了解乾燥無味呀等等，但是如果他讀書一多，這種毛病就會大大改變，難變成易，不能了解變成完全懂得，乾燥無味，變成津津有味。所以，一個眞眞抱着研究慾，自動的去讀書的人，决計不能因爲開始時的困難而灰心。須知不論那個成功的學者，他們在開始讀書時並不是一讀就懂的，假如一讀就懂，我們稱讚某人學識好時，就不會有［治××學二十年］或［留×專攻××學×年了］編者從前有個先生說得好，［······不懂怕什麽？就是書本的作者，他也祗是把懂得的告訴你、他不懂得的正多呢？不過他不好意思寫出來給你讀罷了······］</p>
<p>鄭君所說的［不知怎的］，恐的就是讀書不能引起興趣，而不能引起興趣的原因，恐怕又是讀書常遇疑難等等。所以我們認爲像鄭君這樣開始讀書的人，除了注意客觀的讀書環境而外，還要抱定主張，不怕一切煩擾，硬着頭皮去讀書，千萬不要因讀書無多大興趣而退縮，因爲興趣是慢慢産生的。同時讀書不懂也不要灰心，假如一切的事物現在我們都能懂得，我們便不必再去做研究，要讀書。我們之所以要讀書，就是要使不懂得的事變成懂得。</p>

<h3>打</h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>自從民國成立，直到現在，二十多年，那一年没有戰爭？便是那一年没有打？甲省和乙省打，張三和李四打，有時連得自己一姓也會打將起來，政見不對要打，權利不均要打，動不動厲兵秣馬，積草屯糧，打來打去，打個不休，不知打去了多少的金錢？不知打死了多少的生命？莫怪人家要來［趁火打刦，］打掉了幾省的土地。那末爲什麽這般的不怕打呢？難道是中國人的特性偏喜打嗎？何以見得，聽我道來！</p>
<p>明明通電話，偏呌［打電話；］明明發電報，偏呌［打電報；］起訴涉訟，呌［打官司，］折扣計算，呌［打折頭，］探聽消息，呌［打聽，］作文起草，呌［打稿，］說官話，呌［打官話，］射文虎，呌［打燈謎，］合作經營，呌［打公司，］更夫敲更，呌［打更，］女人化裝，呌［打扮，］互相示意，呌［打照呼，］唱攤簧，呌［打山頭，］餽贈禮物，期得厚報，呌［打抽豐，］居中作弊，以肥私囊，呌［打花手心，］工程師畫圖，呌［打樣，］買奬劵，呌［打發財票，］···口之所言，耳之所接，幾幾乎東也打，西也打，莫怪要打得落花流水，民窮財盡，所謂［精打光］了。</p>
<p>我說凡吾國民，從此罷打，休養生息，以圖自强。不打則已，一打驚人，不打自己，要打敵人。大家打疊起精神，打定主義，打算救國的途徑，打破階級的觀念。各人做各人正當的職業，各人負各人應有的責任，切莫再昏昏懂懂，糊糊塗塗，［坐定打瞌眺，吃飽差勿動。］立志不吸烟，用不着打什麽烟泡；决意不嫖娼，毋須去打什麽野雞；有了一定的工作，那裏有工夫去打什麽麻雀？生計旣能安定，誰願意去幹這打悶棍的生涯？那末烟不禁而自絶，娼不廢而自除，賭風肅清，匪警永息，地方安寗，民生和樂，從此不見［無謂之打］了。</p>
<h3>娛樂</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>爲着要排除苦悶，煩惱，使一個人的感情和思想，不至於走入悲觀的境地，我們尋求相當的娛樂是何等重要啊！我們現在過的是複雜的社會生活，很容易使神經受到刺激，而排除這刺激的唯一良方則莫如娛樂。</p>
<p>如果我們和那些達觀的名流，隠遯的居士一樣，不與實際社會接觸，將𡢃雅的思想，寄託在詩歌詞曲當中，或者每天抱着一壷龍井茶，或者提着一隻烏籠，和旁人閒談着古今中外的趣聞異事，又未嘗不可以使胸懷曠達，心廣體胖；但實際上，我們根本不喜歡有這樣麻木的環境，二則來我們也没有這種閒暇，爲着找飯吃，我們一天有七八小時的工作。</p>
<p>所以我們現在所需要的是業餘的娛樂，但在上海的所謂業餘娛樂又怎麽樣？你瞧！不是賭博性質的跑馬，賽，球。（如回力球。）撲克，麻將之類，便是低級興趣的觀劇或逛遊戲塲，這些無謂的，低級的娛樂，非但不能排除刺激，（也許可以暫時的忘記痛苦。）而且可以全部侵奪我們的正當的意向或反而增加些意外的刺激。</p>
<p>我有個朋友，曾經當過幾年差，環境似乎很安裕，近來不知怎麽忽然悲觀起來，不但思想突變成絶對的左傾，甚至天天藉酒色想圖自殺，起先問他爲的什麽原因，他不肯明白的宣佈；到後來才知道他是做了八個月的賭徒，傾了所有的積蓄；想再從工作上來彌補，也不有具徵了。他還以爲這是都市社會的罪惡，是環境害了他；其實他根本没有懂得娛樂的眞實性。</p>
<p>像這種例子很多。我想··一個人如果不和這種罪惡去接觸，它總不至於會找上門來吧！</p>
<p>假使我們能夠把這娛樂中的罪惡部份，置之不顧，而去找些新鮮的，有益身心的科學遊戲啊，郊外旅行啊，種種柔軟而適宜的運動啊，玩玩音樂啊｜｜也許會從灰塵裏見到晴空，從黑暗中發現光明，不至於由娛樂而走上更悲觀的境地。</p>
<h3>漫話漫畫</h3>

<p>｜戀愛與求學｜</p>
<p>大學時代，是談戀愛最𤍠烈的一個時代；藍墨水寫的每每不是課本，是花般香鳥般美，春般甜蜜的情書；背地相思，暗下心印，某君言有戀愛才有讀書，無戀愛抛却書本投軍殺敵去也；然而這樣到底未免滑稽！</p>
<p>有的說··有戀愛的光芒，才得讀書的勉勵，有的說··有戀愛，卽無心讀書，不知究又孰是了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十六回慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懷人</p>
<p>無論什麽硬心腸的人，凡是自己所受過的創痛，再看到别人來受這同樣的創痛時，自己就要和那人表示同情，卽且自己所受的痛苦，也就因爲這一分同情，完全勾引起來了。趙自强這時佔據了這新婚人家的屋子，把一對新夫婦轟起跑了。他心裏倒是老大不過意，所以望着壁子，他就呆了。回轉頭來，看到王士立在收拾屋子，這就向他摇了兩摇頭道··不必不必！我們另找個地方罷。王士立笑道··這堡裏，全是這樣的屋子，掉也掉不出什麽好處來。自强歎了一口氣道··我不是那樣說，你看人家這裏小兩口子，過得多麽好，一早還親親𤍠𤍠的睡在坑上呢，我們一來，就把人家轟起了，這事作得有些造孽。隔壁那屋子怎麽樣？我們搬上那兒罷。王士立笑道··我們這裏是小兩口子，那邊屋子裏可是老兩口子，把老兩口子轟了，讓小兩口子回來，這又是什麽公理？再說現在的老兩口子，也就是以前的小兩口子變的，我們還是論碰的好，碰到小兩口子家裏，就是小兩口子起，碰到老兩口子家裏，就是老兩口子走，這最公道。自强聽着，也就是一笑，至於他心裏必須要如此去辦的理由，也就只好不說了。過了兩小時，大小行李車，也都拖進堡城了，大家分别的來安頓着，那些未曾逃出去的百姓，看到來的兵，除了借屋子住而外，並没有其他的舉動，比較前次省軍到堡裏來，却要文明得多，所以大家出去了半天，看看堡裏，並没有什麽破壞的事情發生，也就陸陸續續的回到堡裏來了（三三九）</p>
<h3>硯的研究（五）</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>（三）文藝自貴族化變爲民衆化</p>
<p>硯的文藝化，旣倡自宮庭廷，自然有種種貴族氣味，計其要點有二，第一，硯形高大，唐宋以後的王公大人們，揮翰自娛，有大的書案，有侍從爲之洗筆，凈硯，磨墨，把紙，只知美觀舒適，硯的重量，他們可以不問的，迄乎明代，猶保存此種風度，但是愛硯之風，深入民間後，就感覺過大的有些不便，携取旣不便利，浪費名石，又很可惜，而當時的硯形，又大都墨池淺狹，不甚適用，遂漸漸將硯形改小，於小形中研求種種美觀與適用，於是硯形爲之一變。</p>
<p>余藏一對眉歙硯，形甚高大而邊闊池狹，初不明其用意，後悉宋時風尙，研墨須用直研，而不用斜研圓研，［宋晁以道墨經云，凡硯直研爲上，直研乃見眞色，不損墨，若圓磨則假借重勢，往來有風，以助顔色，乃非墨之眞色，］讀此始恍然於古硯墨池多狹長之故。蓋以當時貴族階級，研墨有人，不算時光，慢慢研磨，以求細膩，故以直研爲佳。但自民衆化後，卽感覺圓研快便，認此種大形直研硯爲不適用，而漸藏諸篋笥，故至今尙有流傳者。</p>
<p>第二，雕琢方面亦貴族化，硯的雕琢，大都爲日月星辰龍虎風雲樓臺殿閣之類，極其工緻，於堂皇富麗中，包含些粉飾太平意味。圖譜上所見的，如所謂［天保九如］［保合太和］［鳳舞蛟騰］［海屋添籌］［五嶽朝天］［太平有象］［景星慶雲］［壽山福海］［化平天下］［福自天來］［黼黻帝躬］等等名稱皆是。迨其後時移勢易，一般風流學士墨客騷人，覺得有些俗氣，遂别尋徯徑，對於雕刻都取材山水畫意，力求清麗高雅，並嘔心絞血以求詩詞歌賦銘記題跋的精工，更求善於雕刻的鐵筆名家爲之模刻，（能自書）</p>

<h3>歐羅巴洲巡禮</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>（一）幾句開塲白</p>
<p>夢想着歐羅巴大陸的風土人情，已經十多年了。</p>
<p>我承認，我是一個企慕異國情調的人。特别是對於歐羅巴洲，做了多年的憧憬幻夢，六七年前，我寫過一篇文字，記得其中有這樣的一段··</p>
<p>［我渴想到歐洲去走一遭，我不羨慕瑞士的明山秀水，也不留戀羅馬的磚礫遺蹟，却是想到大都會的巴黎，倫敦，維也納，柏林等處去遊覽。我愛看丰姿美麗，肌膚瑩白，衣飾鮮艷，行動活潑的少女；我愛聽出神入化的大規模的交響樂會；我愛看可歌可泣富於魅誘性的歌劇；我愛嗅濃郁馨芬的化裝粉麝;我愛嘗甜蜜香甘的酒醴。···</p>
<p>多謝造化工智的安排，在一九三三年的夏季，我離開了亞細亞洲的泥土，横渡了印度洋，紅海，和羅馬人所謂［我們的海］，穿過了歐洲地圖上三個顔色不同的國土，經過了許多大都市，終於實現了昔日的夢想和志願。</p>
<p>最近接到國内朋友們的來信，他們也都是歐羅巴洲的戀人，一個朋友問着··［在古羅馬的ＡＰＰＩＡＮ道上，人獸圓塲的陰影下，風和日麗的尼斯海灘上，巴黎的聖母堂和比利時的平原中碰到了什麽黃金髪或黑髪黑眼睛的少女没有？繆賽詩中的意境，在旅程中曾經實現否？請略告歐遊後的興緻如何。］</p>
<p>另外一個遊歷過巴黎維也納，日内瓦的朋友，寫信問起：（你在羅馬遊得怎樣？很希望你告訴我們一些新鮮的事件，尤其是意大利的風情。祝你對於歐洲的姊妹城，都不要失去鑒賞的機會。］</p>
<p>多謝朋友們對於身爲海外十萬里放浪孤客的關懷和你們厚情的祝福。我這一次到歐洲來的動機，是很簡單，無非是想把自身放在一種新奇異樣的環境裏，滿足青年時期的放浪慾望。同時想多看一點的東西，多知道一點事情。</p>
<p>記得廚川白村說過··［在外國過着一兩年的生活，對於作家是很可喜的而且是很有意味的事。排去在身邊索連的種種困難，從極委曲的生活中翻出身來，在行方不定的南船北馬旅程中，任意來嘗自由生活的甘味。卽使在旅舍的一隅，片刻的暇寐，暫時靜悄悄地瞑想一回，或在公園的草茵上享受一種閑散的休憇，不一定要有做什麽工作的必要，不管是一年或兩年，做一個自由流浪的人，是創造暢舒的整個的生活的良法。］</p>
<p>爲了要滿足國内和我有同樣志趣讀者們的好奇心，同時給朋友們報告海外的放縱，打算以後每週記一些歐洲的風土人情和文物，當作一件小小的紀念禮物。這裏是一篇開塲白，下回便要抒寫碧藍海岸的尼斯。</p>
<p>自刻者尤爲名貴）清初讀書人供諸案間，贈諸朋友，都是此類，故雕刻的風尙亦爲一變。</p>
<p>短訊　鐵絲網籬，爲現代建築最需要之材料。無論住宅，花園，球塲，工廠，學校，車站碼頭，欲求防禦堅固而壯觀者，實爲必不可少之裝置。國産網籬以楊樹浦公勤鐵廠爲第一家，該廠可代客設計，並供給一切材料云。</p>

<p>互易陣地、開球之後、東華卽以迅雷不及掩耳之計、小萬帶球進犯、二李一戴、虎入羊羣、頃刻法商禁地、人影散亂鐵騎飛騰、尼古洛夫無奈、阻成角球、小萬開來、派克頂出、馮運佑趕到力射、又被福祿壽拍成角球、小萬再開、馬賽兒頂出、吳幼良拚力掃射、球遂高飛去、小華特得機、洶洶然迫攻過來、挑入球門區域、柯萊脫横身掃去、陸鍾恩雖至轉身㢠護、但已不及、遂成秋色平分、</p>
<h3>戰情烈得一失二</h3>
<p>馮運佑與陳公與、似先有妥協、一打一唱、十分聨絡、陳洪光防守之術、富於進攻、敵五鋒幾有滿途荆棘之槪、戴麟經盤球、闖過中綫、遥傳與小賈、亡命進衝、馬賽兒派克兩騎飛來、小賈已發脚射掃、再以三對二佔得上風、但不移時、柯萊脫在二十五碼處、以峻急之脚頭、低射一記、陸大門竟未防備、拍救不得、又是和平之象、不轉瞬洪光冷箭放來、未生效力、鮑塞特偕柯中鋒等、圍攻東華之門、不能得手、陸長脚欲救險球、遽離大寨、柯萊脫抽身使射、陳公與以手帶足、被罰十二碼、雷迷迪脚到成功、法商遂以四對三獲勝、</p>

<h3>醫德與醫權（DeontologyandDiceology）</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>自余爲［醫師之五權］一文，汪企張先生遂有［補遺］之作，以醫師之權利義務，取法律爲立塲，其所補陳五點，新穎切當，逈出人表。獨於鄙說，微有異議。敢攄所見，列於左方，質之高明，當有益我。</p>
<p>古人有言，博愛爲仁，行宜爲義，［愛］云［宜］云，誠有味乎其言之也。夫急人之難，解人之紛，世稱義士，古謂仁人，矧夫醫者，救人於危亡之中，釋其痛苦，而復之於健康，傳染有所不避，辛苦有所不辭，深夜應診，則風霜暴露，肌骨爲寒，終日奔馳，則手足胼胝，精力交瘁，故夫醫者，本惻隠之心腸，爲愛人之職業，醫乃［仁術］，古有明言，是其立塲，本於倫理，彰彰明甚。惟是醫者，百業之一，雖賢者恥談醫業而［職業醫學］在外國已成爲一專門學科，旣爲職業，則口腹所寄，家室所瞻，胥於是在，故必有其應有之權與夫應得之利，始足以養其廉而安其業。非然者，高談仁義，而枵腹從公，使家室有凍餒之虞，而社會有仁義之譽，非矯仁飾義者流，寗肯出此，蓋不愛其身家，而能汎愛羣衆者，必無其人，親親而後仁民，仁民而後愛物，自古皆然也。夫道德之含義，有［對己］［對人］之分，而二者必須兼顧，權利之界說，有［宜］與不［宜］之别，而二者絶不相容，苟爲應得，斯卽爲［宜］，其於仁義，兩無所悖。故醫金分潤，雖害於義，而正當收入，無傷於仁，此固拙著醫師倫理學中所三致意者，且夫［德］之與［權］，相須而成，相輔爲用，道德之修養不足，則作奸犯科，無所不可。而權利遂出於應有應得之範圍。權利之訂定不明，則刀俎魚肉，人强我弱，而道德乃反爲處世之大累。舍德無以言權，舍權無以護德，此其關係，至爲密切，未必言倫理者不當言權利也，夫東修不辭，世不以孔子爲貪也，明乎也，可以知道德與權利之所歸矣。</p>
<h3>煤油治肺結核之研究與批評</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>肺結核之苦無特効療法。最爲目今醫界之焦急問題。亦卽人類之最大痛苦。就我輩現下所知。有化學療法。血清學療法。理學療法。外科學療法。空氣日光療法。食養療法等等。總其希望目的。不外撲滅體内之結核菌。及恢復已損之壞組織。然而無一可根本解决。無一可滿足要求。實爲吾醫界之一大憾事。予嘗於三年前。著有肺結核治療現今之趨勢一文。發表於新聞報。讀書或尙可記憶。最近世界治肺之精藴。殆盡於是矣。而究其實。或絶對無效。或比較有效。或在有效無效之間。醫者亦毫無捉摸。所謂研究期中之試探術也。而一班醫家藥賈。每執一物。埋頭研製。動亘什年。數十年。卒未有如初願之收獲。此世界積有鉅額之奬金。最高之名譽。而至今絶無一人可攫取。可攀折也。亦醫之恥也。挽近什年。歐美一班醫家。移其化學與血清學之眼光。而轉注於外科療法。乃有人工氣胸術。Pneumothrax肋膜外肺弛緩術。ExtrapleuralePnernlyse塡充術。Plcmbieranug整胸術。Thorakoplastik迷走神經（横隔膜神經）切斷術。Plirenicotomic（PhrenicusEzcehairese）等。最消極之療法創行術以期阻妨病勢。中止進行。與希望病部。得早日結束。是誠不得謂肺結核之治法。乃患肺者之苟延殘喘法而已。此已往事也。亦卽時下最流行最摩登之療法也。</p>
<p>近二年來。日本醫界之一部人士。忽奇想天開。穿鑿到煤油一物。應用於肺結核之治療。母校大阪帝國大學醫學部。肺癆科科長。今村荒男博士。對此問題。亦頗有興味。而加以研究與實騐。其整個的成績。雖未有公開。而零星的報告。則時有發表。然速水寅一博士。則爲唱導本治法之急先鋒。予縱未能追隨諸氏之後。積極進攻。然隨時注意不怠。得機。亦偶一試之。本擬早日有所貢獻於國人。輙以俗冗。乏暇握管。遂一擱至今。不期上月中。本埠申報。有冰玉君［煤油治肺病的證明］之一文發表。乃引起一班患肺者電話函札。紛至疊來。苦無以一一答覆。茲不獲已。於百忙中。分寸𣌿。敢布於衆。幸鑒諒焉。</p>
<p>茲予先從煤油之爲物述起。本品。乃天然鑛産。由井取出時。多如泥狀。不能應用。須經人工蒸發提凈。始可供作燃料。然此項油類中。含揮發點各種不同之物質甚多。如凡士林Vaselin。爲揮發點之高者。弁凈Beuzin。爲揮發點之低者。而煤油品質之良劣。卽對於揮發點之高低。並内含之雜質而異。以是所謂煤油。各國各地所産。及提煉方法之不同。而出品不一。茲槪言之。化學上稱煤油。Petroleum,SteinoloderEedol不外鎖式飽和炭化氫。（C2hH2n＋2）及環式飽和炭化氫（CnH2n）所組成。而美國所産煤油。大都由鎖式飽和炭化氫。如NonaneCoH2oDekaueCroH22而成。然其中亦含有少量之環式飽和炭化氫。如CymolC6H4CH3C3P7等。又若俄國所産煤油。則富有環式飽和炭化氫。其含量。量占百分之八十餘。此外尙含有OlefineCnH2n，TerpeneNaphteneacid。並其他之有機酸。如煤油酸。石炭酸。Asphalt等類似物。以及含氫硫之有機化合物等。</p>
<p>煤油成分之複雜。旣如上述。决非簡單之化合體。故應用劃温蒸餾法。可蒸得多種成分。如Cymcgen　Ligroini5ooC,Petroleumether3ooC,Gasoline79oioooC,petroleumBenzin120|150oC等。而吾輩現在所取之燈用煤油。乃150|300oC間沸騰之Kerosine;Leuchtpetroleum。此煤油性狀。在化學上之大體情形也。</p>
<p>烟油化學上製品。如滾動派拉非痕ParafffinumLiquidum。凡士林VzsolinumIerFene等。皆爲吾醫界常需之品。然均屬外用。若燈用煤油。則除應用於消毒洗滌或皮膚病外。味旣難耐。質亦太雜。從來内用者極少。惟歐州丹方中。恒以三五滴多至十滴。裝入膠囊。作爲鎭痙驅蟲等藥。近來亦應用於胃醱酵。慢性腸炎等。民國六年時。予以嘗試用於霍亂。及赤痢病人。前者大都吐出。無效可記。後者頗能縮短病期。有能以最短期間。奏速效者。惟當時限於病材。不能多數試騐。引爲憾事。（在鐵路任職時嘗以煤油黃瓜拌藤炭。與病者内服。奏效極速。）至以煤油之治療肺結核。近兩年來。東鄰日本。甚囂塵上。各醫科大學。及療肺機關。幾無不𤍠心實騐。大阪之竹尾結核研究所。亦爲研究中心之一。然猶未達成功期也。予服務社會。馳驅於公私之間。現乏實騐材料。復少研究機會。日常僅就病人中。自願者。而慫恿試服。雖無統計可言。其間亦有足記者數事。一，大膽嘗試者。大都非久病淹纒枕席之病人。卽痛苦不堪之結核末期患者。其良果之不舉。本意中事。二，煤油内服。雖無毒害。然其味臭惡。不利於胃。服後。恒多嘔吐者。故無决心之病人。往往不堪再試。尤以神經質者。三，用量少。而長期分服。較爲安全。若性急飮用過量。常可引胃腸病。在咳嗽劇烈之病人。更易發生反胃嘔吐。四，有心臟病。賢臟病。糖尿病。得症胃腸炎。胃潰瘍。脚氣。以及貧血等合併症之病人。不宜服。服後有損無益。五，喉頭結核。賢結核。腦膜結核。骨結核之已腐者。及三期空洞性結核。均無功可錄。以不試爲良。</p>
<p>晚近日本醫學雜誌。對於本問題。亦時有報告發表。然若［主婦之友］等一類之普通刋物。每以非專家之記者。摭拾一二。常不免有張皇過甚。誇大宣傳之嫌如因吸烟過多。發生喉頭氣管炎。而致咳嗽之病人。服三十公撮以後。不特咳止。食慾大進。卽素患之胃腸病。賢臟病。皆一旦全除。與服煤油以治肺結核之本旨。完全不合。此類文字。本擬錄譯。加以批評。惟材料過長。且上期業經丁惠康醫師節譯。發表於本刋。因不再得述。</p>
<p>按煤油。爲脂肪體之一。脂肪之於生活小體。尋常不能供其生活。然亦不必爲其毒害。設若置生活小體於脂肪中。吾輩不久。固可見其死。而其死因。乃由遮斷需要之空氣。或絶其營養物質所致。非脂肪之有殺滅之力也。然天然各種脂肪體中。常含有此外之有機物質。是類物質。每具有特殊之功用。故煤油本體。予意未必有殺菌治病能力。可能者。其惟脂肪本體外之有機物質乎。考煤油中。含有煤油酸。石炭酸。TerpeneNuphteneacid等類似物。據吾輩所知。松節油OleumIerpinthein。可治氣管病。而石炭酸。Naphthalin。則具消毒殺菌作用。然迄今。在内服上。恒極過慮有傷體組織細包。而少用。或不敢用。普通燈用煤■中。所含是類物質。或尙有此外之物。有幾何種類。幾何分量。予旣未暇調查。或尙未有前人報告。茲姑置不論。茲就予所知。因服燈用煤■而致死者。除大量。或體部有特殊情形外。大都不致喪生。以爲對於體組織細胞之損害上。當可無慮。至是。吾輩儘可根據内服藥。對體細胞無毒。或弱毒。對病原體。有毒。或劇毒原則。不妨一試也。至内服分量一層。予主張少量長服。然亦不宜過少。致低落至有效量。尋常每日。姑以十公撮爲標凖。分數次服之。服時。可裝入膠囊。則尤易吞嚥。果腹。易吐。空腹時。較佳。但亦不可不視個人體質之强弱。而加以活用也。（如體弱者。不妨隔日或數日一服。）</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>最後。予猶有不能已於言者。肺結核。在今日之治療主旨。一爲殺滅病原體之結核菌。一爲恢復已破壞之肺組織。煤油之應用。果爲何目的乎。抑盡有功乎。以予觀察。據各實騐者之報告。以爲精製煤油。或弁凈之類。轉無功效。一點而論。其注目處。似不在脂肪本體。而在其中含有之有機雜質。可想而知。而雜質中。現今所知者。大都主在消毒殺菌作用。則其功效。似在前者而不在後者也。惟煤油之脂肪體中。尙否另含有如魚肝油中之維他命等類似質。以爲佐助。則不敢前知。在今日。至多希望能殺滅其病原體之結核菌後。而待其天然恢復。或加以他種藥物。而補苴之耳。然而組織之破壞缺損甚者。恐終不能復其舊觀。此肺病之所以必需早治也。煤油治肺之功。其亦不能逸此範乎。（惠詢諸君恕不能一一詳覆。特此告罪。）</p>
<h3>兒病論症</h3>
<p>— 陳中肯</p>
<p>爲醫不分中外。皆當求病之所在而施以治。决非憑一己之憶說謬論可以立方。然吾國舊醫却有反是者。殊以爲危。茲特舉一例。以徵公論。日前在北京路何姓家診一未滿二月之幼孩。時已四肢發紫。腫脹及於腹部。顔面亦紫。雖氣息尙存。然已奄奄一息。乳水不進矣。檢診之。則四肢已冷及肘膝。脈息僅微。心臟部惟聽著明之雜音。呼吸音繼續不整。而無水泡音。細詢之。方知患病已週餘。初起僅於怒啼時。四肢口圍發紫。飮啜爲難。鄰婦卽指其上下顎之白色硬結。爲礙乳飮之班牙。乃召舊式女醫以治之。該醫則謂已因牙毒而成驚。卽爲之去衣。顚倒反復推拿。而紫赤更甚。肢體漸呈腫脹。乃改延某陸醫診之。計三日五劑。用菖蒲。天竺黃。車前草。大復皮等利水定驚之藥。（未列醫案）曾於一日中排尿至九次之多。而其症則仍未稍减。乃改延某兒科醫爲之診治，計三次，茲錄其醫按於後。（一）月餘嬰孩。咳嗆微微。哭泣無涙。肢不和暖。肌膚色紫。痰𤍠内甚。上壅於肺。肺氣閉塞。症危防變。（二）昨投劑後。哭聲略暢。涕涙甚少。肌膚色紫。肢尙不和。痰𤍠尙甚。壅於肺部。症勢雖减。再防變端。（三）哭泣依然無涙。遍體肌膚色紫。煩躁不安。小便不通。膀胱化失宣。痰𤍠上壅肺胃。症危恐難挽救。（其立方則爲清肺定驚利泄之劑從略）至其家人招予往診時之情形。則已如上述之奄奄一息。無由挽救。而無能爲力矣。入晚果以惡耗聞。當該孩於生後一週時。曾以多啼。及口圍顔面發紫。四肢發腫。而招予往診。其時診得心臟。右心室擴大。肺動脈口部聽收縮期雜音。而第二音微弱。卽所謂先天性肺動脈狹窄。及閉銷症。乃投以强心利尿劑。三日而愈。此次遭難。想因推拿醫生顚倒過甚。體動太劇。心力不勝所致。而醫者竟不求根源。指牛爲馬。而以全身發紫浮腫。未聞咯嗽與氣喘之症。斷爲痰𤍠塞肺。殊堪浩嘆。按血液循環。心實主之。尿利排泄。乃賢主之。肺司呼吸。鼻及氣管屬之。乃一般普通之生理常識人所共曉。設或咯嗽氣喘痰多。乃爲肺氣管之症。今本症依據已往醫按。與當時症狀。旣無咯嗽氣喘。安得謂之痰𤍠塞肺。其現症之全身浮腫發紫。乃血液循環不暢之所致。安得牽强而爲肺症。是其不明症理彰甚。以之立方治病。其所得結果。可想而知。乃國人每有固執成見。斤斤以國粹相號召。而爲人父母者又復以時譽相尙。恐類似之例。决非僅此而焉。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二十六）腥紅𤍠�</p>
<p>（問）猩紅𤍠，我在國舊名是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）猩紅𤍠在我國舊名，稱爲爛喉痧或單稱紅痧。</p>
<p>（問）猩紅𤍠的西文病名是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）拉相文是Scarlatina德文是Scharlach英文是Scarletfever都是猩紅的意思，因爲這種病的皮疹成片狀的猩紅色發疹之故。</p>
<p>（問）這種病原是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）近時大家認爲這種病的病原體是溶血性鍵狀球菌。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣傳染的呢？</p>
<p>（答）是從病人用過的衣服器具，互相傳染開來的。因爲猩紅𤍠的病原體，抵抗力很强，雖隔了一月餘，也有傳染的力量。健康人若吸入這種病原體到咽頭，或從皮膚的創口或從産褥婦的陰部，都得傳染這種病的。</p>
<p>（問）猩紅𤍠的發生年齡，什麽時候最多？</p>
<p>（答）二歲到十歲的小兒最容易傳染；年長的人較少。</p>
<p>（問）發生的季節，什麽時候最多？</p>
<p>（答）秋季節最多。一次罹病後，大多數獲得免疫性。</p>
<p>（問）猩紅𤍠的經道可以分做幾期？</p>
<p>（答）可分潛伏，前驅，發疹，恢復四期。</p>
<p>（問）潛伏期經過幾天？</p>
<p>（答）潛伏期大約有三天到六天。</p>
<p>（問）前驅期，是怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）發前驅時，以惡寒戰慄和急激的體温上昇開始；不久，就現頭痛和嚥下困難。同時扁桃脈和軟顎發生腫脹。</p>
<p>（問）發疹期怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）發病第一二天，在頸部，上胸部，腋下，等處有特有的發疹，三四天時達極度，漸次現於軀幹和四肢；可是面部和頭部較少。尤其是頦部和口唇周圍不致發生？這一部，分比較的蒼白。</p>
<p>（問）發疹的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）發疹約如帽針頭大；起初帶淡紅色，各疹間還能見到健康的皮膚；其後成爲泛發性，呈猩紅色。發疹的部分，有些隆起，壓之就褪色。</p>
<p>（問）在這期中體温的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在前驅期中已經上昇的體温，到了發疹期，更加上昇；其後跟着疹的退色而下降；到發病後第九天，回復到平温。扁桃脈，咽頭，軟顎，懸壅垂等處，發赤腫脹在這期中尤爲增進。（未完）</p>
<h3>書［上海市醫師公會診金規定草案］後（續）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>現在要討論所規定是否爲最低率標凖一問題了。當然呢，對於草案全部所列，一一寫出，是本刋篇幅所不可能的。就是我個人也没有每條都詳細研究過。但大體上看來，對於醫師本身權利，和地方生活程度，雙方尙没有不符合的地方。普通一般人所最注意的幾項，像門診一元，出診五元，急診加倍，夜診倍半；祗須尋常和醫師有過接觸的，大槪總不至嫌高的。普通的手術，像脊椎穿刺八元，膝蓋骨穿刺十二元、腹水穿刺八元、胸液穿刺十元，膿瘍切開三元，等項；價目都是很低的。内中像膝蓋骨穿刺一手術，我覺得有時不容易達得目的的。這一層物質上的報酬，似乎還嫌過於菲薄了！此外像大外科手術費，草案中所列，最高是二百四十元，普通最驚奇的剖腹手術，是一百元至三百元；這一種最高價目，當然是不算多的。我想病家所知道或身受的手術費，超過這最高數目，恐怕總不在少罷。</p>
<p>這一個標凖草案，對於資産階級方面擔負，當然是不成問題的。貧苦階級方面，那當然是非常困難；但這是全社會的問題，應用全部的力量，多設平民醫院以救濟，决不是靠醫師個人或單獨團體所可爲力的。對於中流階級一方面呢？我覺得很可以提出討論的。因爲這階級在社會中數額固多，情况也比較最參差不齊，就是這一份規定草案，也有以這一流人爲對象的。這一階級，我個人的直覺分析，大槪有下列三類··一·有一萬以上十萬以下之資産者；二·有專門學識或技能，月入百五十元以上至五六百元不等；三·無專門學識，但是較優固定職業者，月入五十元至二百元。（舊式商店店員，月入二十元至五十元，亦可附入此類）。第一類屬於小資産階級，這一點低額的擔負，當然是没有什麽問題的。第二類收入較豐富，我想也不致有問題。祗須尋常對於無謂之浪費竭力節省，將醫藥費每年列入預算中；同時對於臨病以多尋醫師爲上策，和病時在醫藥費外之用項二事竭力注意就好了！此中最成問題的，那當然是月入不滿百金，而有家庭負担的了。這種人因收入不多，有因久病而無力延醫，有因無力付醫藥費，而致借貸或當當；這種事實，當然不能說是没有的，但我覺得病家一方面對於相沿至今的幾種惡習貫，不論有錢無錢，能免除者居絶少數。第一對於正當醫藥，外之浮費太鉅。新醫舊醫外，像仙方土方拜神許願等項，祇須有一人說好，總免不了試一試的。我記得去年診過一患白喉小孩，我去診的時候，已病至第五天了，那時症象非常危險，結果因繼續注射血清三次而轉愈。末後我聽說病家此次用欵幾三百元，單是最嚴重一天的四處叩頭許願一項已逾百元；而我所得的，連血清在内，不過四五十元，假使早二天有正能當療，我想還無須此數。以三四十元能痊愈之病，而結果如此之鉅，那末是誰之咎呢？第二對於醫師選擇的能力太薄弱。甲說縬好就張好乙說李好又李好。尋常一種能短期治療的病症，其結果有時竟弄得纒綿床褥，數月不治（未完）</p>
<h3>肺病用煤油治愈之實騐（續）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>自本文發表以來，承社會關心諸士，殷殷垂詢，特作簡單答案，以代函緘。（一）原文係在日本雜誌刋載，但學術不分國界，討論儘可公開，用特將彼邦諸家之證明及實騐，公開報告，俾學術愈究而愈明，是者是之，非者非之，並非將向來所有之合理醫法完全推翻，而專用煤油治療。（二）現在上海肺病療養院用煤油治療者，有腹膜結核，腸結核，脊髓結核，空洞性結核，初發期肺尖浸潤等十餘人，其實騐成績，將來當在本刋發表，以告關心諸君。若有醫界同志，遇有結核患者而擬用煤油治療者，亦可送至本院，俾多得煤油治療之臨床實騐報告，亦關懷諸君所樂聞歟。</p>
<p>（二）肺病之煤油療法效果卽在眼前（視煤油爲有毒者乃由於認識不足）據大阪市立工業研究所理學博士岩本義虎的談話··我因十餘年來，從事油之研究，故一聞煤油可治肺病，立卽相信。</p>
<p>世人似乎多視煤油爲有毒，此實大誤，蓋由對於煤油認識不足，故有此錯誤。</p>
<p>煤油一物，乃係從地下幾百尺之下汲出，至此煤油係如何生出，對於其成因，目下雖尙未有定說，但大多數所信者，則爲［動物根源說。］</p>
<p>據謂古代生息之魚類及海洋中浮游生物類之屍體分解，其蛋白質及炭水化物消失，脂肪則分解爲脂肪酸及甘油，脂肪酸因不溶於水，故瀦積於一處，於是又再分解，乃成爲煤油云。對於此有多數實騐，可以爲證，卽在日本，由油并鹹水之分析，魚油之𤍠分解，或證明煤油中有與魚油同樣之脂肪酸存在，對於日本越後北海道地方等之原油，亦相信其來源係來自古代生息而埋没在地下之魚類，現在已可從大豆油及魚油，製造出煤油，我亦曾從魚油一升，分離煤油四合五勺，實則煤油一物，吾人日常所食之動植物油中，亦本存在，故以煤油作飮料，亦無可怪。</p>
<p>現在西伯利亞方面寒帶之人，卽常飮煤油，又醫療上，（Benzine）可用於創面之消毒及洗滌，又可用以驅除疥癬蟲及毛虱，内服可治胃之異常醱酵，可用作慢性腸加答兒之治療藥，一日量用０·三瓦至０·九瓦，入膠囊中服下，見於醫書。</p>
<p>世人所熟知之煤油乳劑，爲有力之殺菌殺蟲劑，此系於煤油中，加入乳化劑攪拌，如此則煤油化成極微之微粒，可不害及植物而達到殺蟲目的。</p>
<p>從此而思之。設煤油對於人體如無害，則將其飮下後，含於煤油中之强力之殺菌劑，卽爲人體之組織所吸收，循環全身，至於患部，發揮其所有之殺菌作用，亦自不難想像。</p>
<p>一方吾人日常所食之食物中，有脂肪，有鹽類，在胃腸之中，由微妙之生理作用，而變成肥皂液形態，由其强烈之乳化性而將難於吸收之營養物化成乳劑，使易從腸壁吸收。</p>
<p>故飮下煤油後，不止煤油富於滲透力，而且可與少分化成乳劑，亦自容易想像，化成之煤油乳劑，自可由消化系統之腸管吸收入血，循環全身，飮下煤油之後，尿中可發見煤油，皮膚亦可滲出煤油，是其左證。</p>
<p>從此事實推之，煤油仍其原狀，或者多少變易狀態，（例如化成乳劑）流入肺部，與吸呼作用，共相作用於患部之結核菌，使之死滅，亦可得而想像。</p>
<p>我由以上見解，曾一次連續飮下煤油百瓦，充分證實其無害，次向朋友患有肺病者數人，告以我之所信，立時得彼等之同意，自動試試，無不成績良好，嘆其效果顯著。於是我更廣向所識之人，宣佈此事實，偶然由新聞訪員採登報上，在過去一年間，直接致信向我詢問飮法及其他等者，多至三四千人，其大部分，類皆本身患有肺病，其中之過半數，據謂係近於第三期之重症。</p>
<p>我當時不及一一作覆，故係用謄寫版油印以代覆信，飮煤油之範圍，於是擴及滿洲，台灣，北海道，九州，四國，本州等，幾滿日本全國。其中最多者，爲九州一帶及名古屋，而愛媛，近畿三重等地方次之。據此等試飮者之謝信，驚嘆其有奇蹟效果者，爲數不少，所可憾者，卽致信者，皆祇係成績良好之人，其成績不良之半面因未得來信報告，竟無從知悉。</p>
<p>數月前，有一醫師向我提出嚴重抗議，其言曰［煤油對於人體有害，以此種物，飮衰弱之肺病患者，有百害而無一利，且本身旣非醫生，而竟勸人服此，尤違背政府所頒布之醫生法律。］</p>
<p>我答覆以［飮煤油之利害，其分歧點，祇在於分量問題，無論爲嗎啡，爲阿司匹靈，分量太過的卽亦有關人命，如將煤油與此等醫生所使用之毒藥比，則煤油並非毒藥，較之有幾百倍安全，反而較火酒燒酒尤爲安全。至於醫生法律，我雖不明瞭，但對於煤油，知其飮一定分量，並無防礙，自學問上，或自實騐上，皆有事實證明，而且知其對於肺病，具有效果，當然有人請敎，而秘不肯告人，未免有反道德，故而告以飮用上之注意，倘謂如此有犯國法，請將不可之處見敎］爾後該醫師亦未再來信。對於煤油之認識不足，醫生間亦頗多其人，實可抱憾。</p>
<p>假如煤油對於肺病具有特效，是否煤油之全部，皆有效果，抑只其中所含之特異成分，具有效果，實爲有興味之問題，目下正分離煤油中之特殊成分，以供醫學者之臨床實騐，想後日當有詳細發表。</p>
<p>對於其飮法，據我之經騐，最初一次可飮五瓦，隔三四日再飮，先試飮一二次，視有無下痢，嘔吐頭痛，發𤍠等反應，如無此等異狀，可增加一二瓦，仍隔三四日飮一次，可於就寢前空腹時飮之爲佳。</p>
<p>最大量，初期患者可飮二十瓦第二期患者可飮十五瓦，咯血或第三期患者可飮七八瓦。</p>
<p>如注意此分量及飮用時之間隔，斷不致有失。漢藥之大黃，服少量可作健胃劑，服大量可作瀉劑，煤油亦有同樣性質，初飲一二次，雖或有輕度下痢及下軟糞，但以後卽極爽適，又體温或有多少昇高，亦祇係一時現象，並不足憂。飮後必可增進食慾，心身爽快，卽與他種醫藥並用，亦無何妨礙。</p>
<p>至於煤油種類，凡普通點燈火之油，無一不佳，但以稍帶黃色，混和有不純物０·四％者爲佳，極上等者，似乎不佳。</p>

<h3>銀問題之對策</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>八國銀恊定，乃用金國壓迫用銀國之策略也。從其恊定，則用銀國之售幣有限制，鎊幣有限制，用金國之銀幣成分又有限制，而後銀之過剩可免，銀之跌價可免，用金國對於用銀國之輸出貿易，可以發展也。美國之提高銀價，亦其壓迫用銀國之策略也。若其策果行，對於用銀國滙價可跌，輸出貿易可振，而用銀國乃爲其過剩貨品之尾閭矣。斯二者，手段有不同而其對於銀價之有掀抬力，對於用銀國農工商業之有壓迫力，則無以異也。</p>
<p>夫我國用銀國也，自金價漲，銀價跌，輸出貿易，多少受些好影響，輸入貿易，多少受些障礙。近二三年來，對外貿易之入超雖益盛，然因銀價之疲落，匯價上却有一重小小壁壘無形中已爲之挽回不少矣，今焉八國恊定之不足，重以美國之欲提高銀價，滙價上僅有之壁壘，將爲之打破。此後自對外貿易推而至於全國經濟，將愈受其壓迫，從其他方面言，雖亦有若干利益，然其害過於利，無容諱言。馬寅初先生歷次所論，人或議其言之過甚，或謂其見害而不見利，愚獨以爲切合事理，要言不煩也。</p>
<p>然銀價上漲，我國之匯價必須受其正則的支配乎？我國在銀問題上所有之對策，必有如馬先生及銀行界所說之難乎？則恐未必如是之簡單。考生金銀市價與用金國貨幣及用銀國貨幣之對外匯兌市價，有形影相隨者，亦有全不相關者。當其本位幣純分恰如名價而正金又能自由流動之時，用形影相隨者也。在此等時際，操縱生金銀市價，卽所以操縱用金國與用銀國間之匯價。美國停止金本位以前之對外匯價，其一例也。若正金之流動失其自由，則無論其本位幣之純分如何？貨幣之對外匯價，必不足以代表生金銀市價或比價滙價與生金銀價，或可全不相關。至此操縱生金銀市價爲一問題，操縱用金國與用銀國間之匯價又爲一問題，匯價與生金銀價之上落，不必相同，停止金本位後，美國對外滙價，又一例也。我國爲用銀國，若生銀之進口出口一任其自由，則銀價興匯價，當形影之相隨，設銀價上漲，滙價自必受其正軌的支配，爲發生種種弊害。但我國苟對於生銀之進口出口設法取締之，則銀價縱能上漲，而我國之對外匯價未必隨以俱漲也。匯價不漲，則其防止貿易侵略之壁壘依舊在焉，且可加固也。美國卽日日提高銀價，又安能使其對華滙價下跌，以助長其對華之輸出貿易乎？卽推而其他金貨幣國，亦安能利用其貨幣對於生銀之市價，以操縱我國之對外滙價乎？</p>
<p>抑所謂生銀進出口之取締者，在此提高銀價之潮流中，實卽取締其出口而已，取締出口之道有二··禁止出口一也，徵收出口稅二也，而後者之效力，遼遜前者。故最好禁止生銀之自由出口，除中央銀行外不得運銀出口。如是則對外匯票之買賣仍可公開，而我國銀貨幣之對外匯價，可由我國中央銀行操縱之。對内當然仍以硬貨銀幣爲本位弊，而對外則不啻停止用銀，而用紙幣本位矣。其對於國際貿易上之作用，却與英美各國之停止金本位同。去年美國之停止金本位，其用意固在貶低其對外匯價以發展其輸出貿易也，且在避免其對外匯價受生金市價正則的支配，以與英日等國之輸出貿易競爭也。</p>
<p>禁銀出口，則匯票與生銀市價之相差益遠，私運之風將益熾，而操縱滙價之功效，將因以减小，此馬先生之所深慮者也。但當世之禁止正金自由輸出者多矣，金匯票與生金市價懸距者亦衆矣，各國豈獨無私運，曾見其因私運之不能禁絶，而遂開禁乎？防範偵察，乃警察的問題，而非貨幣學及匯兌學上之問題也。</p>
<p>禁銀出口，則應付匯票之差額將無從調節，巨額之貿易入超，將無法結算，此銀行界之所深慮者也。抑不知禁銀出口之目的，正在形成滙價之逆勢，以阻礙輸入貿易，入超結算不便則任其不便可耳。且生銀誠不能自由出口，而中央銀行之輸出權固明明在焉，如欲提稱調節，不患無術。又何慮外國銀行存銀之多，必不能禁止其輸出乎。</p>
<p>禁銀出口之功效及其可能性旣如上，則現碼因銀價上漲而外流云云，亦可不致成爲迫切之問題。徵收銀稅，如爲關稅謀收入，或爲金融業匯兌事案謀便利也，乃爲另一問題。若用爲銀問題之對策，則不如禁銀出口之足以籠罩全局也。</p>
<p>所可慮者，禁銀出口，則各國可以貿易上之收獲，投資於我國。或吸收現銀，以存儲在華之外國銀行。則貿易之入超，將非匯價壁壘所能防範耳。馬先生所慮之外商狡計亦在此，誠屬難以對付。但此種策略，在銀價上漲時能之，在銀價下落時亦能之，若各國之經濟能力復蘇，遲早必出此着，則與銀價上漲問題，本不必　　一談也。</p>
<h3>由國際貨幣戰的觀點上論美國的白銀政策</h3>
<p>— 炳颶</p>
<p>美國提高銀價，收買白銀的呼聲一傳出，太平洋此岸的中國金融界就表示出很大的衝動。一般專家學者們在没有仔細研究之前，就也隨聲附和地大吹大擂。說是神經過敏固然有點近於侮辱，然而說是興風作浪，該也不算過火吧！</p>
<p>美國之是否將白銀立法通過，並不是中國銀行界的一通電報所能濟事的；問題的展開，不在中國的反對或贊成，相反，美國之能否通過白銀法案却完全繫於她自身的需要。當她需要收買白銀以作進一步的膨脹通貨的話，她就收買。當她還用不着收買白銀的時候，縱使法案通過，她也可仍舊不買。所以我們最好不要因爲那邊剛剛有點風聲，這邊就亂放大砲。倒是站在［知己知彼］的立塲上，把彼方的苦衷仔細檢討一下，比較來得穏當。</p>
<p>第一，我們應該知道，美國的收買白銀，在其作用上只不過是用來輔助收買黃金的不足··而並不是說，美國收買了白銀就一定要採取Bimetallism或是改成銀本位。無論是收買黃金，抑或是收買白銀，其主要的目的都不外乎使通貨膨脹起來。</p>
<p>第二，說到通貨膨脹，有一點我們是應該特别注意的。照目前的官樣電報看來，似乎膨脹運貨是專門爲得提高國内的物價，而尤其是農産品的物價。其實，事實却决不會這樣簡單。通貨膨脹，在其本質上是包含着兩重的意義的··一方面是提高國内物價，一方面則是降低對外滙價。由目前美國的經濟狀况看來，與其說收買黃金，收買白銀是爲了提高國内的物價，還不如說是爲了降低對外匯價，來得比較重要。爲什麽呢？｜｜這要從另一方面說起。</p>
<p>第三，原來去年三月美國實施通貨膨脹以來，除去六七月間在生産指數上稍見抬頭以外，一切經濟狀况並没有好轉。不但是民間嘖有怨言，卽當政的諸領袖，心裏也免不了侷促不安。不安雖則是不安，然而一時又不能縣崖勒馬。（因爲如果馬上停止膨脹政策，那人爲的購買力將愈形悲慘。）繼續膨脹嗎？或者安定通貨嗎？｜｜這兩件對立的東西，把美國政府陷於徘徊歧路之境地了。在這種時候，不得已就只得兩面應付。一方面明令减低幣值至五角九分零六毫，以示安定之意；一方面則大量收買黃金（收買白銀當然也要的）以作進一步膨脹通貨的凖備。</p>
<p>這從表面上看來，好像是不合理（爲什麽旣安定又膨脹呢？這話豈不是矛盾？）而其實却是非常合理。</p>
<p>美國要想安定通貨，現在决不能唐突的來幹。因爲假如她把通貨安定而英日仍舊用膨脹的政策來繼續跌落外匯，則她馬上就會蒙到不利。在這種塲合下，她必須採取一種觀望的步驟。她一方面先在０·五九０六的幣值上安定一下，一方面則看看國際風雲的動向如何。假如在０·五九０六的水準上能夠站得住脚的話，那末就暫時按兵不解；假如在這個水準之上，國際情勢對她不利，她就不妨再跌下去。羅斯福有權把幣值跌到百分之五十，其用意卽在此。</p>
<p>從跌落外匯及减低幣值的觀點上來考察，事實旣已如此昭著，然則何以又要收買黃金，收買白銀呢？｜｜這裏就觸到了美國新貨幣政策的根本。</p>
<p>美國自放棄了金本位，於是金庫劵就充斥了市塲（收買黃金並不是以之鑄成金幣而使之流通於市面，其結果只是集中黃金於政府而已。）現在如果收買白銀，則將來亦可同樣發行銀庫劵。發行銀庫劵之目的，表面上是說融通農村資金，而實質上則是準備更進一步的通貨膨脹。卽是說，假使萬一金元幣值跌到百分之五十而對於外匯上仍站在不利的地位上，則美政府可藉銀庫劵之助，再度地來膨脹通貨。這在相對的（卽對外的）意義上卽不啻再跌落對外匯價。</p>
<p>從收買黃金到收買白銀，其間完全貫穿着［凖備膨脹通貨。］而［凖備膨脹通貨，］其意義，與其說是提高國内物價，正不如說是爲得應付國際匯兌戰，國際貨幣戰，｜｜這裏我們解答了第二項的疑問。</p>
<p>當着從國際貨幣戰的觀點上看穿了美國的白銀政策不外是（一）輔助黃金，（二）跌落外匯，（三）凖備再膨脹通貨之後，那末對於美國的白銀政策還應該畏懼嗎？</p>
<p>也許有人還要畏懼的。不過只要認清（一）美國是否收買白銀，要看國際貨幣戰而定（不以白銀法案通過與否爲轉移），（二）美國現在是想安定通貨而未敢放手做去，（將來終要安定通貨的。卽使把中國的白銀全部買了去，日後也終得抛出。）那末，這問題總可和平地圓滿地解决了吧！</p>
<h3>美國證券統制之新進展</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>前嘗撰文論列美國之證券市塲統制政策｜｜見本刋第五十九期｜｜，惟所述說者僅囿於一九三三年五月制定之聯邦證劵法，且偏重於事實之介紹，未遑論其臧否，頗引爲遺憾。矧經濟現象，如滾滾流水，變化多端，舊有之政策，或已不適於過於後之環境，此不得不求變更另圖新進展矣。美國之證券統制政策亦猶是也。爰將一九三四年之新證劵法介紹於讀者，並試對證券市塲統制政策略加批判。</p>
<p>所謂新統制政策者云何？證券投機取締法案是也。此法案之旨趣，請從羅斯福總統與國會之覺書中得之；覺書中有一段云··</p>
<p>［交易所之爲物，係所以便利證券及商品之交易而設者也，在國民經濟生活中，實不可付諸闕如。雖然，爲整個國家前途計，對於交易所之專趨於投機營業一事，吾人不得不亟謀有以防止之也。職是之故，爲保全投資家計　　穏定證券及商品之價格計，吾人宜郭清一切累贅的（Suporfluous）有害的投機事業，而由聯邦政府制定新法，統制證券及商品交易事業]。（節錄自MagazineofwallStreet,15Feb,34）</p>
<p>吾人就去年之證劵法與今年之證券法（以下簡稱舊法學新法）比較而觀，卽發現其各個特徵。舊法之目的，以取締公司債券及股票之不正當發行爲主，今回之新法案，則以取締此等旣發行之證券之交易上的投機爲目的。換言之，舊法取締證券發行於未然，新法則更進一步取締（或統制）已發行之證劵。前者擊其首，後者捋其尾，首尾夾攻，相輔並進，以期達到證劵統制之完成。而究其終極，兩者莫不以保護善良之投資公衆爲依師，吾人如是觀之，則思過半矣。</p>
<p>（二）新法案之内容</p>
<p>今回之新法案，公佈　於二月下旬，全文凡二十一欵。美國全國各大雜誌報章，競相披載。惟在吾國，則東鱗西爪，散見諸報章，旣無系統，又殘缺不全。茲先以最簡賅之文字，探精鈎要叙述如左，所以聊備國内學者研究美國證劵法之參考云耳。</p>
<p>（一）參與清算交易者，以繳納買賣證劵價額六成之保證金爲原則。（按舊法爲五成至三成）。（二）聯邦商業委員會，有取締賣空盤（ShortSelling）及其他有害於公益之一切交易之權柄。（三）違反本法規者，課二萬五千元以下之罰金，或十年以下之徒刑。（四）因買賣新法認爲不法之證劵而致受損者，得向對方作補償損失之訴訟。（五）凡以賣空爲目的而承兌顧客之證劵，俱予禁止。（六）證券交易所所員或經紀人，不得以自己保有之證劵爲担保，向未加盟聯邦凖備銀行之銀行借欵。（七）證劵交易所所員或經紀人之借欵及從顧客接受之儲金（按此二項目構成其負債（Liabilities）不得超過其業務上之資産之十倍。（八）對於顧客託存之證劵，不問爲何目的，苟不得其承諾，不得擅行抛出市塲上。（九）對於證劵價格之操縱（Manipulation），如所謂串通交易(Match_Sales)，共同交易(CombinedSales)及其他人爲的使行市變動之交易方法，及故意流布謡諑，淆混聽聞之行爲，俱予取締。（十）若交易所所員以買空賣空爲必要時，應先向聯邦商業委員會申明理由。</p>
<p>（十一）禁止一切居奇之事（Foresfalling）（十二）相互通謀之交易，俱爲違法。（十三）證劵業者，如係交易所所員，禁止爲證劵担保（Indorcement）之事。（十四）交易所所員，欲爲特殊經紀人時，須另行登記。（十五）舉凡上塲證劵，俱須遵照去年證劵法規定，請求登記。（卽在證劵上塲之前，將其内容，作眞實之陳述。）（十六）特殊經紀人之權利，另規定之，尋常交易所所員不得享受同等待遇。（十七）凡以股票流通於市塲（上塲）之公司組織，應按期將其營業狀况書（包含資産負債表，損益表，預算表及决算表）呈報。（十八）聯邦商業委員會，對塲外之證劵交易，亦有取締之權。（十九）聯邦商業委員會，得隨時檢查交易所或交易員之帳簿及其他記錄。又在必要時，並得列席其理事會及其他會議。（二十）交易所所員，以證劵担保貸欵與顧客之極度，爲過去三年間該證劵最低市價之八成，或現在市價之四成爲凖。（二）（十一）本法於一九三四年十月一日起實施。</p>
<p>上述寥寥數百字之記述，雖不免有掛一漏萬之議，然爲節省篇幅計，不得不作如是辦法耳。雖然，新證劵法之眞諦，已於字裏行間　發靡遺矣。</p>
<p>（三）從舊證劵法至新證劵法</p>
<p>原來美國之股票交易所，係一種所謂任意組合（VoluntaryAssociation）。美國投資界，前此常以此自治制自豪，而今一旦被投諸聯邦政府卵翼下，實予美國投資機構以可驚之大變革。論者謂今回新法，係統一從來各州之青天法。（BlueSkyIaws）而集其大成者；較諸去年之聯邦證劵法，又不啻百尺竿頭，更進一步也。</p>
<p>美國之證劵交易所，多如過江之鯽。然其中最占勢力者，厥惟紐約股票交易所（NewyorkStockExchange），此固人所共知。據穏健之估計，全美之股票交易，其在此紐約股票交易所中行者，約占泰半。故今回新法案之主要對象，其爲紐約股票交易所也顯而易見。從而在新法成立之先與將行成立之際，羅斯福爲愼重其事故，特在上院之銀行通貨委員會下，設立交易所問題調查委員會，銳意研鑽，明辨利弊，幾亘半載。名學者如柏可拉，　雪敎授等俱參與其事。在他方面，紐約股票交易所爲保持其固有名譽及獨立故，誓死反對，并煽動諸銀行及金融機關，爲其後盾。一時輿論鼎沸，爭辯至劇。然羅斯福之藍鷹運動計劃，爲整個的系統的，證劵统制政策僅其計劃中之一部耳。天下大事，未有拘小節而廢全局者；是故羅斯福盡瘁任披荆斬棘之責，終於爲上院下院所通過。</p>
<p>夷二統制交易所致策，蓋昉自英德。而其問題之喚起世人注意，又必在經濟恐慌之後。一八七０年代初期，英國股票價格暴落，爰有王室調查委員會（RoyalInvestigationCommi</p>
<p>ssion)之剏設。該會對當時倫敦股票市塲作詳細之考察，彙集而成［倫敦股票交易所之起源，目的，組織，方法及習慣］一書出而問世。在德國方面，則一八八０｜九０年之間，爲應付當時股票市塲混亂故，亦有德國股票交易所調查委員會之設置。美國則一九０七年股票恐慌後，有囂氏證劵及商品投機調查委員會之組織，一九一０年恐慌後，又有金融托辣斯調查委員會之創立。至於今次之新法案與去年之法案，則不過爲一九二九年大恐慌後之結果而已。</p>
<p>溯自舊證券法實施迄今，殆將一載。交易所在此法限制下，已有不少之改進。如保證金之提高也，定期報告各交易員之賣空賬（Short_Sellingaccout）也，嚴格限制特殊經紀人之資格也······等等，不一而足。簡言之，交易所之自働的改革，雖未能謂爲成績斐然，亦已差强人意。然羅斯福尙不引此自滿，再接再厲，制定今回之新法案。行極端統制政策，褫奪交易所之自治權利，使其屈膝於聯邦政府之前。金融統制之策，於此可謂登峯造極矣。</p>
<p>（四）對於證劵統制之總的批評</p>
<p>新證券法，内容旣如上述，舊證券吾人於本刋五十九期中亦已有介紹，舊法之移進於新法亦瞭然於吾人心目中，此時正宜對證劵統制法作一客觀的批評矣。</p>
<p>統制證劵市塲，在理論上可謂美矣善矣，在實際上可謂正矣當矣，然吾人所不得不懷疑者，卽爲證券法在［經濟上］是否有利？夫投資（Investment）與投機（Speculation），字音酷類，性質又復相連不易區分。彼經濟學鼻祖斯密阿當，分經濟價值爲使用價值與交換價值二種，後世奉爲圭臬。以筆爲例，吾人使用筆而生之價值，是爲使用價值；吾人將筆售諸他人時所生之價值，則爲交換價值。證諸證劵亦然，爲使用價值。由於出賣證券而生之價值，則爲交換價值。從證券使用價值而獲得利益之行爲，是曰投資；從證券之交換價值而獲得利益之行爲，是曰投機。今夫使用價值與交換價值旣爲相關的；未有無交換價值之使用價值也，亦未有無使用價值之交換價值也。吾人於此得根據三段論法而斷曰··未有無投機之投資也，亦未有無投資之投機也。投機投資云云，危險性雖有大小之别，然此中關係，綦其密切，實際上皂白玉石之分，絶匪易易。法案係機械的呆板的，其不足以明是非，究忠奸，實理所必然。結果欲保護投資家，反防害其利益，所謂愛之適用以害之，此吾人所不得不懷疑之點一也。</p>
<p>次爲證劵之流動性（Shiftability）問題。在尋常環境之下，市塲證券，常隨社會所需而自働調節其數量。今證劵法予發行者以種種限制，又予投資銀行家以多方掣肘，實足以减殺證券之流動性，而間接擾亂工商業經濟發展之均衡。且事實昭示吾人，自舊證券法實施以來，證券之流通額與價格俱有一般的降落之傾向。茲將美國十二聯邦凖備銀行買賣證券之比率載錄如左。（根據HavardBuinessReview·Vol·XIINo·3·Jan·1934)</p>
<p>年份　比率　一九二一　二八·四六</p>
<p>一八九一　二九·一七　一九二九　四六·五八</p>
<p>一九０八　四三·００　一九三三　三０·一三</p>
<p>夫各國中央銀行之統制金融市塲政策，最要者爲貼現政策與證券政策。今自一九三三年證券法實施後，聯邦凖備銀行所得以操縱之證劵，日有减少之趨勢。此無異於减少中央銀行之統制權力，是誠所謂弄巧反成拙矣。至於證券價格之暴落，則在一九二九年爲一一·二，迨一九三三年竟降至四·０。由是觀之，證券法於證券之質的及量的兩方面，俱無有裨益，此吾人不得不質疑者一也。</p>
<p>從來非難美國交易所制度者，類多舉其罪狀，曰保證金制度之缺陷也，投機事業之盛行也，串通交易之弊害也。然自舊證券法實施以來，證券交易所自身已悟其非，力謀改革，舊有弊端，幾一掃而空。此後正宜任其自由發展，不應再加之以桎梏，而陷於衰落，此吾人所質疑者三也。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>總之　　　以　　　　　　　　　　　於統制證劵市塲，無過不及之弊。而一九三四年之證券法，則頗有操之過急之者，予證券交易所以過嚴厲之束縛，未敢推崇。雖然，事在人爲，苟羅斯福酌量推行之，或能化險爲夷，不若吾人杞憂之爲患也。</p>

<h3>再談人頭祭靈</h3>
<p>— 余揚靈</p>
<p>前幾天有人談起人頭祭靈，以爲這是表示［可恥的懦弱］及［非人性的殘忍］的行爲。但從另一方面看來，這種行爲，殘忍則有之，懦弱却未必。</p>
<p>人頭祭靈的故事之最動人者，據我所知，當推水滸的第二十五回。武松因欲爲兄報仇，故决定殺死姦夫淫婦，供人頭作祭。但當他的尖刀尙未掣出時，［那婦人已知告狀不准，放下心不怕他，大着膽看他怎的］。說是敵人，而是這樣的敵人，爲武松者、究竟以下手爲强呢，抑縮手爲强呢？看有的人們的描寫，西洋人的復仇，似頗有禮讓之風，旣不懦弱，也不殘忍。然而，我們讀西洋說部，雖未見人頭設祭，但並非没有殘酷的復仇。據正史所載，則法蘭西大革命時民衆對於王黨復仇的殺戮之慘，恐不在黃巢與張獻忠之下。至於俄皇之以哥薩克馬隊襲擊請願民衆，則尤爲殘酷，且眞可謂不武。所以，卽使是西洋人，其實也有種種的復仇者和種種的敵人，强和弱，仁和殘，正直和詭詐，也不一律。若論［只要能將敵人打倒，便不再計較］，則武松醉打蔣門神時，亦有此槪。然而蔣門神可不是西洋那樣的敵人，所以雖是武松，後來也不能不血濺鴛鴦樓了。</p>
<p>水滸上說，武松在人頭設祭以前，先在武大靈前擺了别的祭物，［堆盤滿宴。］金聖歎批曰··［四字］哭！哭何人？哭天下人也。天天之人無一不生咬薑呷醋，食不敢飽，直至死後澆奠之日，方始堆盤滿宴一番，如武大者，蓋比比也。］</p>
<p>這幾句話是很諷剌的。但在實際上，死後澆奠，堆盤滿宴，武大何嘗知道？這一回事，亦只見生人之勢利耳。彭家煌也，朱湘也，生前亦是咬薑呷醋之人，而無人理睬，遂以致死，在死後倒也嬴得堆盤滿宴，但他們也何嘗知道？</p>
<p>祭奠彭家煌和朱湘的人，多將他們的死因，歸諸社會，故社會實彭朱等之仇人也。然而祭奠者惟知祭奠耳，徒知堆盤滿宴耳，徒知把死者的仇人詛咒一通耳，誰也不能替死者報仇，誰也不想到把現社會的頭顱砍下祭靈。由此觀之，武松於堆盤滿宴之後終以人頭設計，到底不算懦弱。</p>
<p>况且，在事實上，人頭設祭，並不常有。中國人的復仇之風，久已消歇。觀乎歷次革命之對於舊物，全體民意之對於敵國，就可知道。</p>
<h3>婦人怎麽心不毒</h3>
<p>— 吳似鴻</p>
<p>聽到許多男子，擱着腿，抽着烟說··［最毒婦人心。］</p>
<p>婦人怎麽心會毒，我倒也要擱起腿說··</p>
<p>上帝有私心，造了女人有月經。俗說··［紅的東西，齷齪，污穢，月經帶不准朝太陽晒。一生只能用兩根，［做大人］一根，［出嫁］一根。一把女人弄得没氣力，不適意，人家便這樣的批評她［懶哪，懶貨哪</p>
<p>婦人說··［那末我什麽男子也不要了］，到外邊去吧，丢了家吧，没有飯吃；去當個小兵也好，就是死在戰塲上，也死得痛快點，但是［禮敎］又說··［雌馬不上戰塲。］</p>
<p>一服一服的毒藥吞下去，等到不能再吞了，自然要　服一服的吐出來呀！殺子報裏的兒子要是不駡和尙，自然他的母親不會殺掉她的親兒子。但是她的兒子偏偏駡了和尙，做了他母親與和尙戀愛的障碍，他母親想··［我是需要男子呀！</p>
<p>偏偏不長氣，女人要嫁人。嫁了人，自然生小人，肚子裏懷十個月，生出來要養育，精神來不及，一個不當心，出了意外事，丈夫便說··［做家也不會做，還算是女人。］</p>
<p>生生孩子，管管家務，到了三十四十歲臉上打縐了，老了，丈夫有錢討個小老婆，没有錢的，跑到外邊軋姘頭。老婆日裏做了一大批事，夜來床頭抱個空，說說說不出，想想想不通，暗地裏打量，弄個小老公吧！［禮敎］說··［不准！］軋個姘頭吧！衆人會這樣稱呼她··［蕩婦！］</p>
<p>機會不凑巧，嫁了丈夫死掉了，年紀青青，生理上需要，再嫁一個吧！［禮敎］又說··［不准！］那末偷偷男人吧！衆人又會這樣呼她··［蕩婦］！你父親死了，我年紀青青的，怎麽不需要，你來做障碍，你就是要我活受罪，旣然你要我受罪，那還不如你死。］於是他母親一刀，把兒子分爲兩段了。</p>
<p>若是那女人抵抗力薄弱，缺少抗毒素，那自然是死路一條。那是癆病鬼呀！死了要來作怪的。</p>
<p>過去是這樣，現在，也許還是這樣。在鄕村裏，我不多說；住在都市中，還是說說都市。不，都市中的婦人也太多了，還是單說說曾經念過幾年書的女子吧！</p>
<p>都市女子當然也是鄕村女子變的，爲着她家裏有幾個銅板，便去讀讀洋書。現在外表上是女子解放了，就是没有官做，在社會上晃幾晃也好。於是一讀讀到都市中來了。</p>
<p>大學堂裏畢了業（也許是中學，也許是留學生），應當做個官呀，男子不是在做官嗎？拉高了噪子呌··［女子要有參政權！］噪得天都要反轉，男子便拍拍她們的肩··［嘿嘿嘿嘿！小鳥兒！你是乘的，給你做個書記官吧！］馴良的，眞的蹲下在他的腿下了，眞的拿起筆來了。仰着她温和的臉··［先生！今天寫那幾頁呀？］她肚子裏想··［總算在做官了，做人要一步步的爬哪！］</p>
<p>但是，不馴良的呢，撅起她的嘴就走，還咕噥着··［給我做書記官，飯店門口我是不擺粥灘的。］她看不起男子，討厭着男子，恨着男子。可是男子總是要的呀！生理上需要還有什麽話。她拍起粉來了，又點起胭脂，把嘴唇搽得如血一樣紅，櫻桃一般小。就是她的嘴本來如糞缸一樣大，她也要點裝得格外小些。兩隻嘴角塗滿了白粉。又，披起皮領的大衣，穿起五寸高的金色皮履，所有的，她姆姆的耳環都當掉了，配掛在身上，這樣她就兩手在腰上又起，凌空的站在十字街口，一電車男人過去了，她眼睛飛飛，飛飛。一大羣汽車過去了，她眼睛飛飛，飛飛。嘴裏又嚷着··［來吧！］一個男子成肺病鬼踢開。［來吧！］二個男子成漏底損踢開。［來吧！］三個男子成了梅毒症滾開。這樣，她痛快極了，快意極了，蹺起她的金皮履，噴着白金龍的煙霧，兩眼迷矇，彷彿在表示，她實在是大功告成，需要休息了。</p>
<p>所以，我也要擱起腿說一句，［婦人怎麽心不毒呢！］</p>
<h3>江都民謡</h3>
<p>— 秋子</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>人在時下，又瘦又黑。門前走過，抓住當賊。［借錢五十文］，［分文也没得］。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>人在時上，又白又胖。門前走過，家裏請坐。［借錢五十文］，［一百又何妨］。</p>
<h3>關於［罪惡的黑手］（續）</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>其次，我們要看一看，在這首詩中，現實的姿態是不是正確地被反映了出來。一首詩是觀念的集合。在現在的中國，觀念的，抽象的詩，眞是多得很，大部分的人都運用着公式。有的是在［無病呻吟］着［風花雪月］。有的是在那裏［起承轉合］地作論文。結果，新詩是千篇一律的。我們要知道，産出藝術的，是現實之正確的反映。藝術的創造，第一，是在於客觀的現實之正確的形象化。在形象化之點上，［罪惡的黑手］這首詩是不是正確呢？雖然是很進步的，但是離正確還有相當的距離。臧克家，在有些地方，表露出自己還不深刻了解社會情形，而抽象地運用着自己的想像。因爲這種關係，他没能把材料充實地發展開來。對於工人生活的了解不深切，對於敎會的了解更不深切。表面地看，他好像是在反對着宗敎的信仰者。可是每個宗敎的信徒不見全是不義之人。敎會中，還有好些複雜的現象。自然，那是臧克家無從知道的。對於敎會的描寫，我以爲還應當複雜地顧到多方面。有好些善良的愚民，是變了迷信的支配，歸依宗敎！而且，應當以洋大人如何地利用敎會之種種事件着眼，不應把罪狀歸到殖民地的木匠的兒子耶蘇身上。耶蘇不是用鞭子打過法利賽人麽？反對宗敎，自然不應是對人問題，而應是對事問題。而在敎會支配之下的各種現象，各種方面，都應顧照週到。對於工人的苦痛，雖然比較週到，但仍然殘存着詩人自身的濃厚的監忍主義哲學。所以，各個工人的不同的心理意識没有好好地表露出來。臧氏的一個大缺點，就是把人物類型化，把事件一般化了。然而，在實際上，事件人物，雖有普遍性，而同時也是有其個性的。這種類型化一般化的傾向是臧氏的致命傷。處理一個題材之時，作者須同時注意到牠的普遍性和個性的。</p>
<p>雖然有好些地方，令人感到不足感到不夠眞，可是，在大體上說，這一篇［罪惡的黑手］是一篇比較成功的作品。這首詩，在各種的限制性之下，臧氏只能成功到那個程度罷！同［烙印］比起來，自然有天淵之别。這首長詩之出現，自有相當深刻的社會意義。我希望這一類的長詩，今後能多産生些</p>
<h3>春天</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>靜靜地立在窗前，陽光鮮艷地照在我臉上，彷彿在向我說··［現在是春天了］。</p>
<p>現在是春天了。我知道。從充滿我房間的陽光裏，從温暖的空氣裏，從紳士淑女們的衣服上，從春遊歸來的旅人手裏携着的花枝上，我都已嗅到了春天的氣味。</p>
<p>可是，我的春天在哪兒呢？</p>
<p>我是没有春天的！</p>
<p>像甜蜜的番石橊和長春籐一樣可貴的青春，也曾在我身上停留過。但現在呵！牠已經過去了。我只能用一個懷鄕病者似的憂鬱的眼，瞧着别人在春天裏歡笑，而把一個夢幻的希望，欺騙着我自己的心，獨自個在寒冷和寂莫裏，在没有春天的光和𤍠，没有春天的幸福和歡笑裏，邁着我痛苦的大步。</p>
<p>痛苦的生命的旋律呵！到什麽時候纔終止呢？</p>
<p>我茫然的望着遠方，用我那憂鬱的懷鄕病者似的眼。</p>
<p>一些房屋遮斷了我的視綫。那灰色的帶着感傷的調子木立着的房屋，牠給我帶來了憂鬱和壓迫，我的心漸漸感覺沉重起來。</p>
<p>我是站在充滿了春天的陽光的温暖的房間裏，但我的心却彷彿被安置在寒冷和黑暗的冬夜裏一樣，没有春天，没有歡笑。</p>
<p>我開始走到了外面。一個浪遊的吉百色人似地，用憂鬱的眼茫然望着遠方。眼光裏有着遼遠的鄕思，和對過去的青春生活的懷念。</p>
<p>外面是籠着陽光的温暖的街。都市的脈搏在作着有節奏的律動。春天跳躍在每一個人的臉上。小型的無綫電收音機在店舖門前播送着銀鈴似的宏亮的聲音。廣告牌上的女人在瞇齊着眼朦朧地向人微笑。電影院閉着的鐵門前，擁擠着潮水似的觀衆，有高傲地啣着烟斗的異國紳士，有帶着南國風味的𤍠情的少女，有陷在性的苦悶裏眼光瘋狂地隨着女性的身影轉動的青年。他們都同樣地需要着一種刺激，一種像門前那大幅彩色廣告上所說的香艷肉感銷魂蕩魄那樣的剌激。（未完）</p>

<h3>暮（八）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>［從北京走的時候，玲玲還没有周歲呢。］</p>
<p>［可是你還是年青，臉色比從前像是更好了。］</p>
<p>［姊姊，不要取笑我吧，現在完全是變成在一個男人的意志下生活着的人了！玲玲，鹿兒，你們到姨姨那裏去玩玩不好麽。］</p>
<p>兩個孩子眞就走到她們的身前，倚了她們在站着，她們用手臂攏了他們的身軀，一種温柔的說不出的快感，在使她們自己微微抖着，她們有着像喝了一點酒的微醺的適意，那肥軟的小手，那細柔的黑髪，那孩子們特有的乳的香氣······在使他們的眼睛又亮起來，她們呼吸急促着，而倚在胸前孩子們的頭，又使她們覺得那麽癢癢的，她們不自主地俯下臉去親着孩子們的上額。</p>
<p>［姊姊太累了吧，你們還是走過來好了。］</p>
<p>［不累，一點也不覺得······］</p>
<p>雖然，她們這樣急急說着，可是孩子們還是聽了母親的話，輕輕地離開她們。她們空是露了有一點失望的眼睛，依戀地看着孩子們從她們的懷中又溜出去。</p>
<p>女僕送茶來的時候，青枝告訴着拿一點糖果來。</p>
<p>［姊姊，不要麻煩吧，天晚了是不願意他們吃什麽，再說他們都有不好的牙齒。］</p>
<p>［孩子們不是太寂寞麽？］</p>
<p>［就要到樓下去了，姊姊們也該早歇息，兩天的行程，孩子們一定也都很疲乏。］</p>
<p>［這次來能住多少天呢？］</p>

<h3>復古𤍠</h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>前天報上，偶而看到這樣一條消息，說有某處敎育復古𤍠，最近發起放風箏運動。放風箏有没有意義，這處不去討論，我想這［復古𤍠］三字倒下得頗有意思。</p>
<p>中國的復古𤍠不自今日始了，每有一度新的潮流過後，就有一陣復古𤍠。民國以前，我不知道，卽如過去不久的五四運動，剛過去不久，接着便是[整理國故]，於是大書店，小書店，都接連出了不少註輯或標點的古書古藉，一時講古的風氣，[甚囂塵上]。這是一陣復古𤍠。民國十五年，革命軍北伐，迨黨軍底定上海，於是三民主義流行一時，這時大家都講着革命，其表現於書店方面的，則是總理全集，三民主義問答之類的書籍，頗充斥一時。這時期可算是新了。但到了現在，似乎又漸有復古的傾向。這便是近來各大書局都出了不少古書，而且是大規模的影印或重排。一方面四庫全書也在翻印了。這可見得目前又到了第二個復古時期。</p>
<p>中國爲什麽這樣經過了一度的［新］必來一陣［古］呢？要回答這一問題，只有從中國社會的本質及其近年之變遷中去探討。</p>
<p>中國根本是一個封建的社會。因爲社會本質是封建的，所以其表現出來的思想一切上層精神建築物，也都是封建的。故有尊君親親之義。但這封建制度，不久是被外來的資本主義所破滅了。跟着封建制度的破滅，於是一切上層精神建築物就來一陣［新］。但這［新］是不久的，因爲他的社會本質，雖然由於外來的資本主義而破滅，但其破滅是不澈底的，而且有時還維持着舊的（如軍閥爲帝國主義所歡迎所利用，）一方面中國新的社會基礎（近代大工業）又没有建立，一切社會制度在飄蕩之中，於是過了一時，舊的又抬頭了。這樣每一次破壞，來一次新，來一次新，又來一次舊，中國社會不斷在變換，［新］與［舊］也不斷在交替出現，其結果便有了［復古］的名詞發生。</p>
<p>中國的［復古］，便是反映着中國社會的一進一退。</p>
<p>自然，這退的成分是很少的，大體是進的成分多，所謂［舊］，不過在進的途程中偶而停留時暫一出現而已，終究是一種臨死的掙扎，往後他是只會越變越微弱的。</p>
<p>這便是復古名詞的由來，也便是復古的本質。</p>
<p>社會是不斷的向前開展，而復古仍不絶出現，這眞是一個有趣的現象。我們不信社會是會倒着走的，看罷，這［復古𤍠］能繼續着到什麽時候？</p>
<h3>看了［高貴的人們］的戲</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>在報上看到凌鶴先生導演了自己編製的劇本［LadiesandGentlemen］［又名高貴的人們］定於今日在青年會演出，也就好久有没看話劇了心裏十分高興。晚飯後坐車直上青年會，進了門上了樓，戲塲門口人在收票，裏頭人是差不多滿座了，鐘是已經過了七點半，就向門口收票的一位先生說，找凌鶴先生，他說就要來的，在臺上。等了一回，來人說凌鶴先生說票子没有了，我立刻臉上紅𤍠起來，進退不得！正在搔着頭髪的時候，（眞的那時抬手搔了自己的頭髪在焦燥！）樓梯上走來了友人老黃，彼此點了頭，我說没有票，他將下午的票拿出來，守門的先生說不行，彼此望了一眼，他說買去，我請你本想客套一番說我請他，可是彼此彼此······也就不開口了。進了塲，老黃見了波兒彼此招呼，三人便坐在一起，而這時臺前燈熄，臺上的笛聲也呌了。（連說明書都來不及看）</p>
<p>幕開的時候，看到凌鶴先生自己在拉幕，三人都在說凌鶴在拉幕，不提防臺上的屏風嘣的一聲倒下來，我心裏在說槽了，眉頭不覺縐緊，替凌鶴先生着急，可是留心一看，在屏風後一對男女Kiss在被屏風一到都驚散，男的（那汽車夫卓見超君飾）奪門而跑，女的（那娘姨王媽易葉小姐飾）正在發怔，太太（柳蔭女士飾）從房門裏頭出來了。從太太的責問與王媽的扯謊，這才明白那屏風的倒下原來是在做戲，心裏寛鬆了一下而且不禁一笑。這就是導演先生的手腕呵。太太滿面雅片烟容，說是剛抽了幾口大烟精神抖擻，招呼王媽吩咐帳房的以後，留心海關上的朋友多買來這一種老雲土。回頭對於家裏的事說是越看越不成體統，還是唸她的觀音經去。王媽將觀音菩薩像下的香爐燒了以後。太太虔心唸佛去了。</p>
<p>（［佈景不像高貴的人們的家，太寒酸了！］老黃說。我回答··［這只是二房東們的家吧了。］波兒添了一句··［眞不像有錢的人家。］我說··［置景眞不容易，爲什麽不用布條呢？］······）</p>
<p>從外門進來了小姐（洪逗小姐飾）呌了媽，太太只是在唸經，小姐說有話要講，撒嬌推太太，太太只得停了唸經問她，什麽事，她說今晚時裝展覽會開茶舞會她一定要去，太太敎訓一塲不准她出頭露面，她說一九三四年的上海小姐有當選的希望，太太也就高興她的女兒在上流社會裏頭交際的風頭很健。小姐出門坐汽車走了，太太也進了内房，奶媽（凌鶴太太飾）與娘姨上塲話東話西，姨太太（周道小姐飾）出來，擺了架子，駡了一頓，······</p>
<p>（波兒說，［這是誰？演得好。］老黃說，［很老練。］</p>
<p>外面皮鞋聲響，進來了老爺的秘書徐夢熊（金山君飾），姨太太呌王媽進去收拾房間，又呌奶媽抱小少爺去玩，等了他們走了以後，兩人立刻親密起來。姨太太說他的位置是她玉成的，要他的酬報，他說預備買東西送她，她不要，她要他的心，於是乎商量逃走，而老爺的皮鞋聲響了。老爺（周伯勳君飾）進來以後就和秘書商量廠裏的事，决定在女兒身上想主意，要她嫁給遠東銀行行長劉鐵聲做塡房，而向劉鐵聲商借現欵救濟工廠維持營業消滅工潮。太太出來，聽說大不贊成，說是女兒才十九歲嫁給一個五十多歲的人，駡老頭子造孽。可是又說是她不管了，只要老頭子問得過良心就好，雅片癮來了，回房而去，老爺只是摇頭。汽車夫喘着氣地跑來報告，廠裏工人罷工了，秘書急走下塲，姨太太在冷笑，老爺却是惶急惱氣不知道如何是好。第一幕完。</p>
<p>拉幕的將幕受了臺前燈的牽扯而遲緩，老爺周伯勳君仍然表演着呆相站在那兒，引起了臺下大笑。這是周君的老練所在，應付裕如，可是却因此而令臺</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>下大笑，他是没有料到的。易佈景的時間太長，而且丁丁之聲不絶於耳，老黃說··［太慢了，第一幕給人的印象忘記了，與第二幕聯接不起。］</p>
<h3>心頭的她</h3>
<p>— 述古</p>
<p>她歸去了，在神經錯亂的記憶裏，彷彿還不出十天的時間，但我天天是在無名的悲苦中打滾着，懷着悵惘的心情。</p>
<p>她平日在這兒，對我可無多大的感應，她還不能作爲測量我的悲歡的儀器，（這也許是違心之語）僅有的一些稀稀落落的往還書札，我從没有在這之間獲得過半絲的慰安。可是今朝一去了，倒引起了我這麽多的傷感，這究是爲的什麽，連我自己也無法可以理解。</p>
<p>我現在感到了寂莫，深深地感到那不能排遣的寂莫。公園電影院，······這些都變成了我厭倦的對象，要是死在這間斗室中枯坐着，則更其感覺针氈似的難受。於是祇好徧向十字街頭瞎溜。我往往歇思的里地整日整夜在大街小巷内往返踱着。</p>
<p>我每當被空虚悲哀層層圍着無法動彈的時候，我又會成朝着天，抽冷氣上帝慣惡作劇，它旣給予了我們相識的緣分，却又不使我完成我的理想，我眞要深深地詛咒它了！</p>
<p>我成了一具無用的僵屍。我一些也不能指使我自己去做事情，就是日常生活的寢食，至此也突變了一種特殊情調的變態。我已如那喪失了靈魂的人兒，我已如那被主子遺棄了的奴隸。</p>
<p>有時翻開書一看，不一會，一個個的方塊字，逐漸幻變成漆黑一團，隨又展開一幅慘然的畫圖，有笑絞，有涙痕，有旖旎的身裁，有美女的倩影，最後一幌，便反映一張潔白的空紙。</p>
<p>爲了要尋找［定心丸］，我的視綫隨了我的心思在四際游移，於是從箱篋中取出那被珍藏着的相片與書信，企圖在這温馨的重味之下，獵取幾許心頭的陶醉，結果終於僅贏得一此獰笑，一些冷視，多殘酷，多刻毒！</p>
<p>我常時這麽想··她旣要去，爲什麽不把她那印在我心靈深處的深影一同帶走呢？爲什麽不乾脆地抹去那隠約還可看到的一些陳跡往事呢</p>
<p>我也　　　　過，我是没有對她那個的資格的。將來的結局終究是悲慘的，還不如早自放手的好。爲了這，我下過决心，想把她完全葬送於［忘却　］的墳墓裏。一切都已試過，一切都是枉然。我什麽地方都去過，我什麽勾當都幹過，可是什麽都無濟於事。我愈想不想起她，那青春之火燄愈燃燒得熾烈，那思慕的𤍠情愈洶湧得瘋狂，再也抵抗不住，馬上我便屈服成爲自己的叛徒了。</p>
<p>是的，她是我的魂靈兒，我的靈肉早已一致付託於她，我可没有其他一切，却不能不有她。然而聖潔的愛神，袛要你能給我一點小小的賜與，卽使你僅用你愛的千分之一，我已是［獸中的麒麟］，［花中的牡丹］，而可以傲視一切了。</p>

<h3>賣舊報紙</h3>
<p>— 華若</p>
<p>每天化十枚銅板買一份非看不可的［老申報］，積到一個相當時期，大約四五十日光景，零用掉的不算，爲數也就大有可觀了。爲了想收回多少成本，便學着經濟起來，把她發售出去。這樣，得到一筆額外小欵不必說；狹隘的房子，亦可多個空位置好放物件。一舉兩得，何樂不爲？</p>
<p>我之所以很儉約的在幾疊舊報紙上打算盤，還是一年來的事。想起從前在學核裏唸書的時代，區區一些舊報紙，算得什麽？每逢寒暑假要離開宿舍，嫌多帶行李討厭，便將幾樣頗值錢的用品像𤍠水瓶啦，面盆啦，舊皮鞋啦，一塌刮子送給茶房老爺去做紀念。這一來，旣闊氣，又少麻煩。左右下季開學上校時，重新購備；家裏誰短少你的用費？可是［黃金時代］已經過去了；自從挾了一紙文憑，由學校跳進社會來，［時運不濟，命途多舛］，便轉入了［黑鐵時代］。誇得我國社會局至今尙未執行［失業登記］；不然，我的［尊姓大名］，早就在民廿一表裏佔據着一格了。現在不但不敢輕視這些撈什子｜舊報紙；牠幾乎已變成了我的財産之一部份。這宗買賣的收入，老久就列入在我的［生活表］中［進欵］項下了。我這時甚且怨恨着［廢物利用］之途不廣；如果擦過的自來火枝還可以有用塲，有人收買，恐怕我也會把牠聚積下來去換錢呢！</p>
<p>買賣舊報紙，不惟可補助窮人生活費用之不足，有時還能濟人之急。記得先前有次衣袋裏僅存的幾個銅子也花完了，眼見晚飯又没有着落；肚子正在嘰咕地作響的刹那間，偶然發現寢床下放着一厚疊舊報紙，又凑巧聽到外成收買零物者的呌聲，我一時［心血來潮］，便馬上立刻，把這綑廢物拿出去掉換了兩隻［八開］和七枚銅板回來。數目雖少，暫時却可以把腹裏的［革命］打壓平靜；其偉功實不亞於十萬軍火。還有一次，一位遠方客人過訪。不幸這位朋友是慣抽香烟的，來了總不好意思没禮没貎，連應酬上最起碼的烟茶也不備。然而身邊却碰巧也是一空如洗；終於又靠了幾斤舊報紙的力量，才勉强把這塲面敷衍過去，不至丢臉。由這兩回的敎訓，我以後就儘數將每日閱完的報紙積存起來··非到水窮山盡的危難關頭，是不肯輕易讓牠離開牠安靜地躺着的地方的</p>
<p>說起賣舊報紙來，我倒還覺到無限慚愧。大約兩星期前吧，我又把八七斤舊報紙售給一位白髪的老頭兒，當時他身上所帶無幾，計算起來，尙缺少四個銅子；就向我講情，說明天補給。我一時像很胡塗了，忘記站在我面前的，是一個窮苦的老人，而相差又只是這麽渺小的數目；竟不答應他的要求。後來他擔心這買賣做不成，不免少賺幾文錢；便跑去問老虎灶裏人相量借來凑還我，且言明願將該報紙作擔保品，結果却被他們咤走了。我這時才天良發露，覺得我未免太無情，太鄙嗇了；就對那可憐的老伯伯抱歉地說道··［算了，不必給了，報紙拿去吧！］</p>
<h3>没有兒子不好麽！</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>天空飛着片片的雪花，北風虎虎的怒號，洗凈而慘白的天，充分地象徵着一個旅途倦歸的游子的心情。</p>
<p>是前年的冬盡，冬盡的一個傍晚，經受了一週間舟楫火車的震簸，算是抵達了家園的前路，眼綫透視過霏雪層，顯著的映進我的眼簾，叩着我的心扉的，是門檻上的一個大［制］字。呵，母親呵，兒子祇福你幸運地趕完了你的苦命！我的眼睛一花，接着耳邊就是一陣嗡嗡般的哭聲。［五弟，你怎麽也回來了！］三哥倚靠在門前，苦笑帶哭的在招呼我。</p>
<p>說起三哥，總算還有個比較好的印象，他的孝敬父母，那是有口皆碑的；就是待我們弟兄姊妹，也還相當的好。特别對待我懷着一幅𤍠白的心腸，他一有什麽心事，總愛向我來發洩，雖然當他向我發洩之後，依然還是一回心事，半點也得不到什麽解救，安慰。</p>
<p>當我剛好擱起行裝，三哥又挨近前來了，而且對我這樣說··</p>
<p>［五弟，母親是很快的［百歲］了，我也有了三十，我，我，還是一個我！］接着是一把鼻涕一把眼涙，儼然有無限心事。</p>
<p>［三哥，人總該是要終老的，母親旣已去世了，也就算了吧，着急是空的，我想清了這一點，所以我是不大急了！］我勉强的向他說了這麽幾句安慰話，接着··</p>
<p>［三哥，你說你也有了三十，還是一個你，是不是因爲幾年來的生意虧本虧得太厲害？若是的話，要你自己是認眞將事，没有馬馬虎虎，倒也是問心無愧。不過是生活苦些。這，那裏值得這樣悲傷！三哥，莫太迂了呵！想開點吧！］</p>
<p>［不是，不是，生意本來是年年虧本，但這並不使我憂慮，因爲我的生活很簡單，只有自己兩個人要飯吃。···］又是嗚咽煞住了下文。</p>
<h3>舞塲隨筆</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>眼前展開着一幅富麗的人物風景，靡靡的音樂在醉人的吹着打着，每個男人像做夢的夜遊者似地，在追迂緩的而又急速的音符飄動着。嘻嘻地跟摟在手裏的女人調笑，女人亦都開着一面花朶的笑臉，但那種笑時常是帶着勉强的，而且含了沉重的寂莫味。每一次音樂銅鈸一開了喉。馬上就有許多人搶着跳，被搶着跳的女人心裏自然灌滿了快意高興，於是就會暫時遺落了生活的憂鬱，而與男人嘻嘻地笑着。那些老是乾坐着的女人，固然也都擺着笑嘴，而那笑勁兒可看得出是砌上去的。她們的心理都在𤍠切地，希望能夠像其他的伙伴一樣，音樂一響便有人走上來抱着她跳着跳着，，一次失望了。沉下腦袋去，低低地嘆息了一下，於是第二次又張着𤍠望的嘴巴，笑着臉，或許使了一個媚眼給近邊桌子的男子，但終歸還是的望，她們老是獨個兒坐着，好像被人們忘記了似地，那麽陰鬱地在色彩的繁華中僵坐到天亮，而明天依然是那麽孤寂地坐了一天，並在數不盡的日子中間，坐了一個月，一整年······時間的　音緩緩從她腦袋後邊飄了去，飄了去，到了她青春如花葉一般憔悴了的時候······那時候，這兒再看不見她的影子了，她已身後生活到一個更黑暗的環境裏去，就是那些音樂剛一開了喉就有人爭着跳的嘻嘻地笑着的女人，也一同没了，可是却另外來了一些笑得越有勁兒的女人，而且代替了以前每個人的位子，日了亦隔的反遠了，每個進來的男人却是那一張没了靈魂的夜遊者似的臉孔，和嘻嘻笑着的嘴巴，一同地從前跳着，現在不知去到什麽地方的女人，他們可想也未曾想起，他們看見的是眼前更夠味更夠動人的女人，像一朶才開了蕾的夜合花，嬝嬝地站在深宵夜色的華燈下面，儘着你瞧着，而又喝醉了酒没了魂的行屍似的把日子消磨下去······</p>

<h3>露露的勝利（十四）</h3>
<p>— 義大利Ｍ賽心歐著景心譯</p>
<p>［現皮的露露，但是你相信事情都會這麽順利麽？你曉得我厭惡爭吵的。］</p>
<p>啊，說不動的母親！啊，媽媽，你是比聖托馬斯還不信人的話！是的，的的，從我的廣博的經騐看來，我保險給你不會有流言。羅勃特是一個紳士，他不希望一個人不愛他而和他結婚。］</p>
<p>［我看不可能的是蘇菲亞這件事｜｜］</p>
<p>［没有比不可能的事再可能的了，］露露嚴重地回答着。</p>
<p>［我的親愛的，你總是這麽多的格言！不要再多說了。到時候我們再看吧；也許時間會收拾了我們的事件。不過無論如何也不能不說你是一個胡塗蟲］。</p>
<p>［而且很任意｜｜］</p>
<p>［缺少判斷力｜｜］</p>
<p>［而且是一個狂妄的動物。隨你怎麽說都好；敎訓我吧，我是該受的；你再没有话說了麽？我在等着呢。］</p>
<p>［吻我一下，去睡覺吧。晚安，孩子。］</p>
<p>［謝謝你，媽媽，晚安。］</p>
<p>［這樣是更好的，］那位善良的母親想。［露露還是太年青的。每一天人們都看得見那些隨便的結婚的悲哀的結果。願上天保佑我們别那樣！這樣是更好的。］</p>
<p>［啊哈！］露露說，喘了一口大氣。［我是被迫得用出了怎樣的外交手段哪，說服了媽媽是要用怎樣的手腕啊！我可以作一個十足的外交官了。這是怎樣的一種勝利呀！的確的，絶不像是一種愛情的勝利，但這是露露的勝利！］</p>
<p>她在她姊姊的門邊停住脚，靜聽着。她不斷地聽見有壓抑着的嘆息。可憐的蘇菲亞已經失却了心靈的平靜了。］</p>
<p>［睡吧，蘇菲亞，睡吧，］露露輕柔地囁嚅着，吻着門鍵，幾乎就像是吻着她姊姊的額一樣··［安靜你自己吧，休息一下吧。今晚我替你作了好多事了。］</p>
<p>於是這位大量的女兒熟睡了，由𤍠着她所愛着的姊姊的歡快，她感到幸福而滿意。</p>
<p>時間，那老好的時間，永恒的知慧的老人，完成了他的工作。露露向她自己這位尙未結婚的姊姊，作一個新娘，是應當穿一件藍色的絲長袍呢，或者只是穿一件帶花邊的草青色的薄絹長袍呢。她問羅勃特是否給他預備下許多的棒棒糖呢，而且問蘇菲亞是否她願意給她那條美麗刺繡的，像一片微風一片雲彩的手帕。羅勃特和蘇菲亞知道這個女兒是有幹才的，對她的歡快的無思想而微笑並且愛着她，把她當作他們的護神。</p>
<p>［因爲我總是主張，］羅勃特。孟特甫蘭寇對着他的朋友講到他的結婚說，一一對夫婦應當是薄於不同的趣味。極好的結合。這樣他們可以互相理解，混合起來，形成一個完全的整體，同時那薄於相同的趣味的，就像是兩個平行的綫；他們一同前進，而總不會相遇。可是若當有了愛情的時候······！我總是這樣說。］完</p>

<h3>曼麗璧克馥之痛心語（下）</h3>
<p>— 奚冷</p>
<p>＝爲范朋克受非難而雄辯＝</p>
<p>＝軀殻可不計精神實爲寳＝</p>
<p>曼麗璧克馥的不能和璧克泛爾告别，可以從下面的幾句話看得出來的。她說··［我愛我一切可愛的東西，我的瓷器，我的玻璃器皿，我的書籍，我可愛的内衣，我的香水鮮花，從窗户裏瀉進來的陽光，白的墻和青的地毯，璧克泛爾固有的和樂精神，我亦愛在那些屋子裏度的安閑的時光。那裏隨便什麽一件小東西，都好像在告訴我一種柔情歡愛似的。］</p>
<p>至於外面所傳說的璧克馥將和范朋克言歸於好的一節，璧克馥亦一槪否認其說。她說··［外間的種傳聞，說島格拉斯將來紐約和我相見，以後將言歸於好等等，我可以肯定地說，那些話都是毫無事實爲根據的。現在島格拉斯已經開始拍演他的新片“AdiosDonJuan。他將在西班牙拍取許多外景，當然他不能脫身上紐约來。再則我們兩個人，亦從來没有提遇這件事。他什麽時候回美國來，我一些都不知道。我恐怕他自己亦不知道吧。</p>
<p>［不過我對於各種雜誌報紙批評烏鳥格拉斯的話，我眞不明白。他們說他在英國拍片子。但是爲什麽他不能在外國拍片子呢？在外國拍片子，難道就是他一個人嗎？爲什麽許多别的男女明星，在外國拍了片子，演了戲，報紙上一句話都没有，好像是當然的事呢？爲什麽許多英國演員，像克萊芙，勃羅克，勒斯李霍華德，龍那柯爾門等來到美國，我們這樣歡迎他呢？爲什麽他們偏偏要爲難島格拉斯一個人呢？其實，島格拉斯並没有拿美國的錢到外國去化。他賺的是英國的錢，而他所賺的，還有一部份是用在美國的。他的片子雖是在英國拍的，但是發行方面，却是歸聯藝公司辦理的，這就是帮助美國的出口事業，多售一張片子給英國。至於說島格拉斯想入英國籍，我完全不相信。我想他亦不至於做這種傻事。倘使他入英國籍，英國將對於他，發生和美國人同樣的惡感。當然，這些都是對於他傳聞失實的地方。你知道島格拉斯的性格，是見異思遷的。他一回想住在這裏，一回又想住在那裏。有一次他想住在錫蘭。他說得錫蘭是天上有，天下無。他拿錫蘭比得像天堂，非彼不樂。後來他又想住在中國的北京。現在他又住在倫敦了。他是住在［神氈］上的人，一回兒飛到這裏，一回兒飛到那兒。現在那神氈又將他載到英國去了。不過無論如何，我上面已經說過，這件都是島格拉斯個人行動的自由，無論什麽人，不能横加干涉的。］</p>
<p>後來那位記者又問曼麗對於自己的將來，有什麽計劃。曼麗說··［我對於目前的將來，並没有什麽計劃。我在這短時間之内，好像生存在眞空之中，那裏是空空洞洞，一些東西没有的。猶之暴風雨之後，那裏有一個安息的時間，毫無變化，毫無進展，一切都在停頓之中。這些東西，在人生的過程中，亦會發見的。我們常常經過了多少年的辛勤工作，受了種種艱難困苦，和環境奮鬥着，忽然地來了一個時期，覺得一些都不想幹了。我現在已經到了這個時期。不過這在人生的過程中，並不是眞的毫無變化與進展。這個實是一個内向生長的時期。根向内心的深處生進去。這就是進展，不過這是屬於内心的，思想的，精神的。我現在自己覺得比以前任何時候爲平安。我覺得我已經經過了一個大難而倖免了。狂風暴雨好似已經過去了，我心裏覺得非常之之輕鬆。我不能說我没有感覺到寂莫，因爲那是不確的。但是，我從我母親和哥哥的去世之後，我已了解到人生的空虚短促。我們想想，一個人身上所有的化學成份，採集起來，亦不能值到六角七分錢，那末我們身外的得失，其微渺可知了。再論到我在這裏，島格拉斯在那裏，更是不值一論。因爲人身軀的分離，並不是分離；要是精神的分離，纔是眞的分離哩｜｜（完）</p>

<h3>評［着手成春JimmyAndSally</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>｜大上海映｜</p>
<p>一陣陣煦和的春風，薰拂着都市裏Ladies和Gentiemen的心頭，跳躍的走上了大上海的石級，在黑暗中，靜靜的凝視着銀幕，消磨了二個鐘頭，重又走下了石級，詹姆士鄧和克蘭德麗娃的姿勢美妙的Kiss，在他們的腦膜上留着一個深深的印象，嘴邊掛着滿意的笑。</p>
<p>一個胡鬧的喜劇，自然是非常適合他們的口胃的。</p>
<p>戀愛，［着手成春］自然也寫着戀愛馬洛罐頭肉品公司的一位職員和主任的女書記戀愛了，野獸的肆性，流氓的滋事，莎萊的不喜歡他的Nonmarriageidea，終於，這位罐頭肉品公司的職員其當一家肉品公司裏的推車。生活的痛苦終使他悔悟，而重又回到了故鄕，重又投入已做廣告部主任的舊情人的懷抱裏。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們是可以看到一些營業蕭條的公司的掙扎，和失業者的痛苦，但是一切都給胡鬧掩没了。</p>
<p>本來，這一對小世民的愛，是被現社會的動亂不安阻礙了順利的進展的。我們在［藝海春光］裏看到了對於現在那種墮落的兩性關係，婚姻制度的不滿，而提出了一個空想的解决辦法，但是［着手成春］却嘲弄了一個固執着Nonmarriageidea</p>
<p>在個人的生活問題尙没有辦法的時候，家庭是不能建立的，雖然還有别種理由被遲婚論者主張着，無疑的，遲婚論的存在正說明一般人對於現在的婚姻制度的不滿，與感到生活問題的威脅。</p>
<p>然而，遲婚論是屈服於困難的婚姻問題的主張，只有澈底解决社會的生活問題，社會的婚姻問題自然也可以迎刃而解。但像這［着手成春］的描寫來一個其美重過莎麗的happyending只是巧妙的虚構。</p>
<p>導演的處理，還能使人滿意，如在衆獸肆性時象的衝出，以及流氓大鬧歌塲的幾個塲面。詹姆士鄧甚努力，所謂［新興的𤍠女郎］克蘭德麗娃亦尙可取。</p>
<h3>評［海上鶯花"TheMidshipmaid高原光陸······蘭心］</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>最近幾張英國片，如上次的［海峽情潮］，這次的［海上鶯花］，都是以海上生活爲背景的。這原因，是有相當社會根據的，因爲英國是一個海上島國，它是以海外殖民地爲生存條件的，向海外發展，成爲英帝國人民最大的興趣，因此在電影裏也喜歡採用海上生活作背景。</p>
<p>特别是［海上鶯花］，可以說是英帝國海軍的誇耀，却倫格軍艦停泊在瑪爾泰，岸上的土人聽到軍艦發的砲聲，嚇得急向樹上爬，而士兵的生活表面上是其樂陶陶的，划船比賽，艦上的歌舞會，眞是歌舞昇平，［帝國萬歲］！</p>
<p>柏西爵士是一個［商業鉅子］，他代表海軍經濟緊縮委員會去巡閱軍艦，實施節省政策，假如眞有這回事，當然是經濟恐慌所使然，其實上，在現在，那裏還說節省海軍經費，最近的報載不是說海軍軍費的預算擴充多少千萬，要准備第二次世界大戰嗎？</p>
<p>下等士兵的怪樣子，没有文化敎育，連一曲歌也唱不好，當然是上等人開玩笑的資料，而土人對於［文明］人的嚇怕，當然也是他們引以爲光榮的。至於副艦長科斯布利迷於爵士女兒美色，輸了比賽，那正是英雄本色。科斯布利和爵土女兒在幕後抱吻，爵士看見，大爲不快，然當他知道科氏卽海軍公爵杜亞的大兒子，又答應了；在這樣的社會裏，女兒自然也是商業家的好商品。而由此我們又可看到，商業和大砲，是一齊來的。</p>
<p>全劇故事簡單，簡直没有什麽可以描寫的，要還是開一個歌舞音樂會，玩這個花樣，揷進一些短的戲中戲，眞單調得很。</p>
<p>資本主義社會的藝術内容空虚，是大家所公認的，牠不能爲藝術展開更廣大的園地，除非藝術家把眼光向着社會的另外一面。</p>
<p>AlbertdeCourville的導演手腕，並没有什麽特殊的地方，約瑟瑪許的表演以活潑見稱，她的眼睛帶一種哭笑不得的形情，柏西爵士年老無力，管束女兒甚嚴而女兒又不服管束，想要責備副艦長，又爲副艦長的勢力所不許，正如老英國商人的没落姿態，唯表演者FredKerr尙覺不夠，至於表演，攝影，音樂，畫面的轉換等都平常，對話一部份還活潑有趣。</p>
<h3>衣着最講究的首推亞道爾夫孟郁馥</h3>
<p>最近倫敦，紐約，和好萊塢三個地方的貴族裁衣師，發啓一個選舉，要决定諸大男明星中，誰的衣着最講究。結果閨閣派明星亞道爾夫孟郁（AdolpheMenjou），被舉爲衣着最考究的男明星。亞道爾夫的衣箱本來最很著名的。他的四季時髦衣服，總在一百套以上，俱係紐約，倫敦，巴黎，好萊塢，各處名工截裁製的。亞道爾夫事後，恐怕人家誤會要做一個衣着講究的人，非衣服多不可，就發表了一個宣言。他說··［一個人要衣着講究，袛要有三套衣服就夠了。一套是半正式集會的地方穿的深藍色衣服，一套是裁剪合時的粗織呢做的衣服，頂好多一條燈籠袴，預備每人在家隨便或運動時候穿的，還有一套是平常同門穿的乾凈衣服，最好是深醬色的。］他說一個講究衣着的人，衣箱裏不一定必須要有晚禮服。這種話由亞道爾夫孟郁的口裏說出來，似乎是異乎尋常的，因爲他自己是以晚禮服和高帽子著稱的。</p>
<p>怎樣才是一個衣着最講究的人？據那些裁衣師說，第一要自己身叚體態好，無論穿什麽衣服，都顯着合式的樣子，就是穿了大方格子的衣服，在大街上走着，亦不致於使人側目而視。這次選舉，除亞道爾夫高中魁首之外，大小范朋克亦在被推舉之列。其餘的幾個人是，龍那德柯爾門，克萊甫勃魯克，羅伯蒙高茂，喬治賴甫德，和華納柏克斯脫。很可異的是，平時以衣着入時著稱的英國皇太子喬治，竟名落孫山，未被推舉云。</p>

<h3>凱塞琳女皇ScarletEmpress（九）</h3>
<p>— 素梅</p>
<p>那少年警衛官還問着她，到底她是誰。凱塞琳怒叱道··［我不是已經告訴你，我是大公夫人嗎？］那少年哈哈大笑道··［你是大公夫人，我還是個大公哩。］凱塞琳咬着牙道··［你要是大公倒好了。］那少年低着頭，看着她緋紅的臉，微笑着道··［我要是大公，怎肯呌你在這個時候，還在外瞎摸呢？］凱塞琳覺得那笑，是充滿着𤍠情的，是屬於人性的，易於諒�</p>
<p>解的，友善的，她不覺心裏一動。她問道··［甲必丹，要是我不告訴你就是誰，那怎麽樣呢？］那少年停了一停說道··［那······在這種黑夜裏······什麽都說不定的······但是要是我幸運的話······］凱塞琳歎了一口氣，她已死去的心情，猶存餘道一絲氣息，她說··［很好，甲必丹，我恐怕你是很幸運的！］他突然地將她抱了起來，凱塞琳一些不拒絶的將櫻唇凑上去給他吻着。在她的身後，那個洋囡被遺棄在地上了，被擲棄了，被忘記了，永遠······。</p>
<p>這又是一天，克蘭姆林的鐘聲，又大響起來了。禮砲亦是轟轟地響着。在各禮拜堂裏，敎士們率領着人民跪着祈禱，他們都是涙流被面的感謝着上帝，因爲俄國已經有了男性的嗣君了，而大公夫人凱塞琳就是那嗣君的生母。女沙皇或者有些懷疑，但是她自足地不去深究了。她所祈禱的，現在已經得到了。她是向來不慣尋求一件事情的最後歸宿的。此外當然祗有大公彼得一個人，心裏明白他受人慶賀的無理由，但是他却竭力鎭壓着他的怨怒，很狡猾地去安排他的計劃。在凱塞琳自己呢，她毫無懼怕地，她旣不爲企望而焦灼，亦不受良心的譴責，祇是胸有成竹似的照常行事。她每天早晨騎着馬，在郊外雪地上馳騁着，每日有一兩個青年貴族陪侍着，她將寵愛濫施着，而受之者，都因爲她的美貎和貴爲未來的皇后，莫不没頂圖報。她每日本到窮苦人的區域，散佈着恩賜，一大筐一大筐的食物發給窮人，親自去安慰着他們，鼓勵着他們，她檢閱着軍隊，誇奬眘他們的整齊的陣容，和煇煌的軍裝，使軍心都歸附了，願爲她而粉身碎骨。同時在她冰冷的心胸裏，她簒奪威權的慾望，亦一天一天地膨脹起來······决定了她的前途·····操縱一切，一切的人······不計成敗利鈍地進行着。</p>
<p>至於她的兒子，她很少和他見面的。女沙皇對他防範極嚴，一切的衣食，敎育，統通是他自己當心着，但是凱塞琳却毫不爲意。俄國要她生一個嗣君，她已經給生下了，至於其他一切繁文縟節，她全不放在心上。她和亞萊克賽，亦已久不見面了，因爲女沙皇已經派遣他出國去了。公爵夫人伊麗沙白已經受了女沙皇的譴責而不許再入宮了。大公彼得獨自在屋子裏悶悶不樂，祗有每天將射殺他妻子無數的偶像自作消遣······靜待着時機。（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Baotou Telegram: Fu Zuoyi, Men Bingyue, and others arrived at Linhe on the evening of the 17th. The Jin-Sui Army occupied Dengkou on the evening of the 17th. Dengkou and Shizuizi were the two main bases in the rear of Sun's army. Now that Dengkou has been lost, the situation is critical. Sun's army is now greatly alarmed. When the Jin-Sui army occupied Bulun Nur Three Saints Palace, it captured hundreds of Sun's soldiers, who were transported to Baotou in batches and will be sent back to their hometowns. Yesterday, over one hundred people were transported from Linhe. This morning, the 18th, military police escorted them onto the PingSui train so that they could be dispersed and returned to their hometowns along the way. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram: Fu Zuoyi entered Wuyuan at Shenshi (3-5 PM) on the 17th. The advance troops of the Jin-Sui Army occupied Dengkou at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 17th. The troops of Sun's army, led by Lu Fengnian, who were defending Dengkou, collapsed and retreated. Fu has ordered the various units to pursue and attack. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram: The units of Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengzhou occupied Shangjin, seventy miles southwest of Three Saints Palace, on the evening of the 16th. The enemy has fled in disarray towards Dengkou. The cavalry vanguard has reached the Fu family village, twenty miles from Dengkou. The majority of the Fifth Division has reached the vicinity of Shangjiang near Three Saints Palace, only sixty miles from Dengkou. Fu departed from Baotou for Linhe on the 17th. Wang and Zhao will meet with Fu and then go to the front line to supervise the troops. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi is in Linhe, personally leading the strength of three divisions and one brigade, advancing towards Ningxia territory. Men Bingyue also accompanied Fu. Dengkou is currently garrisoned by the remnants of Sun's army's Lu Division, less than 3,000 men, who have deployed defenses in the nearby area. Lu Fengnian sent a representative to contact Fu to negotiate surrender, willing to be reorganized into the Jin-Sui Army. Sun himself is at Li Gangbao, besieging the various brigades of Sun Ziyu in Pingluo County and Liu Yueting and Ding Futing in Ningxia. Sun is unable to withdraw and is feeling threatened by the Jin-Sui Army on the northern front, and is extremely panicked. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The remnants of Sun's army north of Ningxia city are still stubbornly resisting in various forts, attempting a final struggle. A certain central government brigade arrived in the suburbs of Ningxia from Gansu Province on the 15th. The Jin-Sui Army is attacking the area around Three Saints Palace, occupying Tianxingquan, and actively pressing forward. The morale of Sun's army is disintegrating, and the situation is chaotic, making it easy to resolve. The enemy besieging Pingluo city has been firing shells for days, but has not dared to approach. Another part of the army has gone to build fortifications on Shizuishan, intending to prevent the Jin-Sui Army from advancing west. Li Chunhua, the brigade commander of the First Cavalry Brigade of Sun's army, and Lv Cunyi, the commander of the Second Brigade, have telegraphed their surrender one after another. Ma Hongkui has ordered Li Chunhua's troops to move to the Yuquan Camp area south of Ningxia, and Lv Cunyi's troops to move to Tongning, Tongsou, and other forts north of Ningxia, all of whom have reached their destinations and are being reorganized. Yu Shiming and other cavalry units are being contacted separately for surrender, which can be realized soon. As for the issue of Sun himself leaving the army, there is still no definite news to Beiping. His attitude is difficult to predict. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Sun's troops were heading west, they owed about four to five hundred thousand yuan to shops and chambers of commerce in various places such as Tianjin, Linhe, and Baotou. Sun expressed his hope that the authorities would repay the debts on his behalf when he met with Fu some days ago. Fu telegraphed to Ji Hu in Beiping to report. After Ji and others met with He, they telegraphed back to Fu, saying that if Sun could immediately step down, everything would be no problem. The debts owed by the army would be investigated by the Jin authorities in Jin, and by the Military Commission in Tianjin, and would be repaid by the Military Commission. Sun's personal life would also be no problem. If Sun has no intention of stepping down, then please, brother, return to Beiping on the 22nd and do not negotiate with him further. It is heard that Fu has returned to Pingluo after meeting with Sun at Li Gangbao. This telegram was sent yesterday. (18th Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The authorities are not paying much attention to the issue of Sun leaving the army. They are now paying attention to the flight of Sun's troops. They have telegraphed the Jin-Sui Army to pay attention to preventing their escape, and have also telegraphed the Ningxia army to be informed. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sui Telegram: Sun's army in northern Ningxia is still entrenched in various forts, stubbornly resisting, attempting a final struggle. A brigade of the First Division of the Central Army of Gansu has arrived outside Ningxia city. The Jin-Sui Army is advancing westward from Three Saints Palace. The two armies plan to join forces and take Dengkou in one fell swoop. Sun's army is defending Dengkou very strongly, and the fortifications built at Shizuizi are also very solid.

<h3>Yunnanese in Beijing Discuss British Mining Case</h3>
<p>Resolved to Send Representatives to Petition Central Government</p>
<p>Expeditiously Lodge Representations with British Ambassador to Withdraw British Troops</p>
<p>Request Yunnan Provincial Government to Substantially Colonize Border and Protect Ban Hong</p>
<p>Form Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation Promotion Association</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yunnan fellow-provincials association held a meeting at the Central University's Zhizhi Hall on the 18th regarding the British invasion of the border for mining. Over 150 people attended. Wu Zhenzhou was elected chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. Zhang Weihan reported the contents of a telegram from the Yunnan Provincial Government, saying that Li Peitian had originally intended to attend in person to report, but was unable to do so due to illness, so Yu would give a brief report. The Yunnan-Burma border is originally the Fuchuan mineral area, which has always been under our country's jurisdiction. Only when the Yunnan-Burma border was delineated, Xue Fucheng arbitrarily decided by the British, resulting in endless disputes. The British have long coveted the mines and have shown intentions of aggression from time to time, which our country can never recognize. Now the provincial government's telegram reports that the situation is extremely urgent (the original telegram is omitted due to secrecy). Our government and people should jointly be responsible and negotiate with the United Kingdom to protect the country. Then Li Zonghuang, a member of the Yunnan Provincial Committee, said that the Ban Hong issue is an important issue at present. Judging from the situation in recent decades, it is only one of the important issues. However, the Ban Hong issue must not be left unresolved like the Pianma and Jiangxinpo issues. Therefore, I have the following suggestions for your reference: (1) As a temporary measure, first negotiate with the British ambassador to withdraw British troops and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. (2) As a permanent solution, organize a Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation Promotion Association to urge the central and local governments to delineate the border as soon as possible, in order to establish a systematic and permanent solution and strive to the end. The Ban Hong issue is not only related to Yunnan Province, but also to the survival of our entire nation. Subsequently, Zhang Weihan and others successively expressed their opinions, advocating for telegraphing the Yunnan Provincial Government to step up colonization of the border and send personnel to protect the Ban Hong mines, and resolved: (1) To elect representatives to petition the central government, and decided on the following principles: A. Request the central government to expeditiously lodge representations with the British ambassador to withdraw British troops from Ban Hong, and not to take any further actions before the border demarcation is determined. B. Request the central government to send a plenipotentiary commissioner to supervise surveying experts to the Yunnan-Burma border to survey and demarcate the border. (2) Telegraph the Yunnan Provincial Government to substantially colonize the border and send troops to protect Ban Hong. (3) Telegraph fellow-provincials from abroad to jointly support. (4) Organize a Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation Promotion Association. (5) Elect Wang Tisan, Zhang Weihan, and other thirty-seven people as petition representatives. (6) The declaration and petition of the congress shall be submitted to Li Zonghuang, Wang Tisan, Zhang Weihan, Zhang Fengqi, and others for review. (7) Elect Wu Zhenzhou, Li Rentao, Li Peitian, Zhang Weihan, and other fifty people as members of the Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation Promotion Association. (8) The petition representatives will gather at the Yunnanese Beijing Students Association on the 21st and petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., respectively. (9) The Greater Yunnanese Beijing Students Association will hold the founding meeting of the Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation Promotion Association on the 25th. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Nanjing from Hankou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the HMS Cockchafer at 5 PM on the 18th. After landing, he went straight to the British Consulate to rest. According to Knatchbull-Hugessen's spokesman, his visit to Hankou to inspect the British Consulate, British expatriates, and commercial conditions was very positive. There are many British expatriates and busy commerce in Chongqing, and it is necessary to add a consulate. He plans to go to Shanghai in a few days to pick up his family and go to Beiping around the 24th. Regarding the British mining in the Yunnan border, it still needs to be studied, and it is inconvenient to answer at this moment. In addition, in order to promote Sino-British relations and socialize with the consuls of various countries stationed in Beijing, the British ambassador will host a banquet at 8 PM on the 29th to invite Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang and heads of various ministries and commissions such as Huang Shaoxiong, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, and Chen Shaokuan, as well as consuls of various countries stationed in Beijing.

Song has ordered them to go to Zhangbei and hand it over to Zhao Dengyu for responsible handling. The Chahar authorities then negotiated with the Japanese army and asked them to withdraw. Now the Japanese army has agreed to withdraw immediately. Song is scheduled to arrive in Beiping from Tianjin tonight. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan went to Beiping from Tianjin on the evening of the 18th. On the evening of the 17th, Song received Qin Dechun's report that he had left Chahar to come to Beiping. Song will rush to Beiping to listen to Qin's report and meet with He and Huang to discuss the Japanese army's unprovoked entry into Guyuan, eastern Chahar. According to outside information, the Japanese army that entered the two and four districts of Guyuan is part of the Mogi Brigade of the Third Division. There have been no movements in recent days.

<p>(Beiping) Since Pu Yi's usurpation of the throne, the Japanese side has felt increasingly urgent about the issues of postal and traffic connections and setting up customs. Traffic connections are especially important. In order to actively solve the various problems, they have increased troops to eastern Chahar to exert pressure, hoping to achieve their goals. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan will come to Beiping by car from Tianjin with his secretary Wang Shijiu tonight. He is scheduled to visit He and Huang tomorrow morning to ask for instructions on everything and stay in Beiping for a few days before returning to Zhangyuan. He summoned Xiao Zhenying for talks tonight and telegraphed Qin Dechun to not come to Beiping. The authorities here have repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese embassy about the Chahar problem. The Japanese side replied that the troops sent to Guyuan and the fourth districts were purely to prevent the rebellious troops of Zhang Renjie from fleeing east, and would be withdrawn as soon as Zhang's troops were transferred. Song plans to summon important military and political personnel to Zhangyuan for instruction after returning to Chahar. Huang Shouzhong, a relieved military officer detained in Zhangyuan, has been sentenced to ten years in prison, and Li Zhongyi has been sentenced to six years in prison. Rumors that Huang and Li were shot are not true. Zhang Renjie, the commander of the Tenth Division, and Wang Jianlong, the regiment commander, are currently being held in the military headquarters.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Deliberations on the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>The drafting of our nation's constitution today is intended to establish a fundamental law that the entire nation, government and people alike, can universally trust and abide by. It is meant to transition from the period of tutelage under the Kuomintang to a constitutional era where the people directly govern. The painstaking efforts of those drafting the constitution cannot but be acknowledged by all of us. However, since the revolution, there have been numerous instances concerning the national constitution, from the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China in the first year of the Republic to the Constitution for the Tutelage Period in the twentieth year of the Republic. The calls for national salvation through constitution-making have also become tiresome to hear. Consequently, many people hold a lukewarm attitude towards this constitution-making process. It is regrettable that the crystallization of the drafters' years of hard work has received such a weak response from the people. Nevertheless, in the process of national construction, constitution-making is an indispensable step. We should not reject food because of choking. Therefore, I will briefly address several points in the draft constitution that still require careful deliberation.</p>
<p>(1) Article 47 concerning the election of representatives to the National Assembly should be amended to adopt both professional representation and regional representation. The reasons are detailed in section (9) below.</p>
<p>(2) In each article of the [Chapter on the Rights and Duties of the People], there are phrases such as "[...] unless by law [...]" and "[...] according to law [...]". Many commentators regret that the people's rights are only guaranteed by law and lack constitutional protection. They suggest that it would be more definite and concrete to specify in the constitution the conditions under which civil rights can be infringed upon. Upon reviewing the Constitution for the Tutelage Period and the constitutional drafts by Wu Jingxiong and Zhang Zhiben, we find that Zhang's draft adopts the principle of constitutional protection, while the Constitution for the Tutelage Period and Wu's draft do not. Zhang and Wu were both key figures in the Constitution Drafting Committee. On this point, their views differed significantly. The draft constitution follows Wu and the Constitution for the Tutelage Period, essentially leaving the government room to restrict civil rights at any time. This is actually quite unnecessary. Even if civil rights are protected by the constitution, the government can still declare martial law and suspend the constitution to deal with emergencies. If civil rights are arbitrarily deprived in peacetime, rendering them illegal, is the draft constitution intended for dictators and tyrants? For now, let us take a step back and say that even if we want to maintain the principle of legal protection, at the very least, the word "suspension" should be removed from Articles 11, 12, 13, 14, and 23.5, bringing it closer to the true meaning of the sanctity of civil rights.</p>
<p>(3) (A) Equalization of land ownership is one of the two major methods for implementing democracy. The draft constitution states explicitly that "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Therefore, the equalization of land ownership should occupy a very important position in the draft constitution, which goes without saying. However, what is the meaning of the term "land"? Economists have different opinions. We believe that a clear definition should be given in the draft constitution to avoid future difficulties in interpretation. The current concept of equalizing land ownership must focus on the word "ownership" and not obsess over the equal distribution of acreage. However, there should still be maximum and minimum limits on the area of private land owned by individuals. The draft constitution does not address this point either. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated "land to the tiller." Not everyone is a "tiller," so not everyone needs to own land. However, the income from land should be used for public purposes. Therefore, the state should make full use of the flexibility of land tax rates to gradually transfer land ownership, making land state-owned, and then socializing it. This is what is meant by "equalizing land ownership." As for the methods, Dr. Sun Yat-sen specified three items: "taxation according to value," "purchase according to value," and "increment to the public." The draft constitution only has definite provisions for the latter (Article 27). The former two only leave a vague impression in Article 24. Article 28, which states "Supporting owner-cultivators and those who use land themselves," is also too far from the ideal of "land to the tiller." (B) In Chapter 3, only farmers and workers are protected and assisted by the state and the government. The development of other productive enterprises is entrusted to the private sector (Article 31). This should be supplemented with reference to Article 177 of Wu's draft and Article 166 of Zhang's draft.</p>
<p>(4) According to Article 51 of the draft constitution, the National Assembly has significant powers. However, those who express disappointment in current commentaries all say that its name does not match its reality. One reason is that it meets only once every three years, which is too infrequent. Another reason is that each meeting is limited to one month, which is too short. As the National Assembly has one representative elected from each county throughout the country, there are already over 1,800 people. Including representatives from Mongolia, Tibet, and overseas Chinese, there are about 2,000 people. In fact, it is impossible to convene meetings frequently, and the meeting period is difficult to exceed one month. Therefore, some people have proposed remedial measures to reduce the number of representatives and convene meetings once a year. At the same time, they advocate abolishing the National Committee. We strongly support the suggestion to reduce the number of representatives. However, since it is called a meeting once a year, the meeting period cannot be extended to a year. Assuming the meeting period is limited to six months, it cannot be said to be short. However, during the six months when the Assembly is not in session, its powers must still be exercised by a body similar to the National Committee. The exercise of the Assembly's powers has continuity and cannot be determined by periods. We believe that if it is necessary to abolish the National Committee or similar organizations, the National Assembly must be changed into a permanent body that can convene meetings at any time. Its representatives would be re-elected every few years. The difficulty is that the number of representatives cannot be reduced too much, lest the true meaning of democracy be lost. For example, reducing it to half of the current quota cannot be said to be small, but in reality, there are still about a thousand people, which is still inconvenient for convening meetings frequently. Therefore, to weigh the pros and cons and to consider the facts, the only option is to maintain the National Committee and reduce the powers granted to it by Article 58 of the draft constitution. Most importantly, the power to accept impeachment cases against the Premier of the Executive Yuan by the Control Yuan and the power to accept votes of no confidence against the Premier of the Executive Yuan by the Legislative Yuan should generally be vested in the Provisional National Assembly. In this way, the power of the National Committee will not be too large, and it will have the advantages explained in the following paragraph.</p>
<p>(5) The Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries and committees shall respectively administer their administrative powers (Article 87). All important matters concerning the Executive Yuan shall be decided by the Executive Council (Article 90). The Premier is merely the chairman of the meeting (Article 89). The appointment and dismissal of the ministers and committee chairpersons must also be submitted to the National Government for approval in accordance with the law (Article 88). When the Legislative Yuan presents a vote of no confidence or the Control Yuan presents an impeachment case against the committee, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall resign (Article 86). The ministers and committee chairpersons do not bear joint responsibility. From this perspective, the Premier of the Executive Yuan in the draft constitution does not have the authority of a British or French Prime Minister and is subject to the dual control of the legislative and supervisory organs. The obligations and powers are not balanced. Among the heads of the five Yuan, only the Premier of the Executive Yuan has no fixed term of office. The Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan exercise the powers of no confidence and impeachment without any restrictions. The application of the constitution should fully exploit its interconnectedness. The so-called "checks and balances" in English means nothing more than this. Therefore, when the legislative body casts a vote of no confidence against the executive body due to dissatisfaction, the executive body may also dissolve it if it believes that the legislative body's resolution is contrary to public opinion and appeal to public opinion. Conversely, if the legislative body does not have the power to propose a vote of no confidence, then the executive body also does not have the power to dissolve it. Rights and obligations are like shadows that follow each other and cannot be separated for a moment. Therefore, we propose that the provision in the draft constitution regarding the three-year term of office for legislative and control committee members be deleted. All cases of no confidence or impeachment against the Premier of the Executive Yuan should be handled by the Provisional National Assembly. If the Assembly rejects the case, the Legislative Yuan or the Control Yuan must be dissolved immediately and re-elected by the Assembly. If it accepts the case, the Premier of the Executive Yuan must also resign. In this way, the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan will be cautious and will not casually propose votes of no confidence and impeachment cases. However, the above refers to the Premier of the Executive Yuan's opposition to the vote of no confidence and impeachment case. If the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigns voluntarily without waiting for the resolution of the National Assembly, there is no need to go to the trouble of appointing a new Premier to succeed him. Or, if the Premier of the Executive Yuan is reluctant to leave office and constantly convenes the Provisional National Assembly and constantly holds elections, would it not be cumbersome? The answer is that convening the Provisional National Assembly is easier than a national referendum. Moreover, in an era of enlightened public opinion, the Premier of the Executive Yuan can examine public opinion and determine the direction of his departure. If we say that there is no public opinion in our country, then the entire constitution is inevitable to be based on fiction, and nothing can be discussed. Furthermore, if we must maintain the existing outline of the draft constitution and do not want to make major changes, then the Premier of the Executive Yuan may have a three-year term of office, the same as the other heads of the Yuan. Those who resign due to the establishment of a vote of no confidence or impeachment case shall be treated as exceptions. If the National Committee does not accept the vote of no confidence or impeachment case, the term of office of the Premier of the Executive Yuan can be stipulated to be extended for three full years from that time, the same as the newly appointed ones. According to the Weimar Constitution of Germany, the parliament can propose the impeachment of the president by a two-thirds majority. The president should be temporarily suspended from office and a public referendum should be held. If the vote maintains the original resolution of the parliament, the president must resign and a general election must be held. Otherwise, the parliament will be automatically dissolved and the president's term of office will be extended for seven full years from the date of the vote, the same as the newly appointed one. The method is well-intentioned and can be imitated. According to Mr. Su Songfen, who participated in the drafting of the constitution, "the president has little power, and the power of administration is still controlled by the Premier of the Executive Yuan. However, fearing that the power is too great and will lead to autocracy, there are the provisions of Article 96, Paragraph 1, and Article 86, Paragraph 2, to control it." However, looking at the overall layout, correcting the wrong is not a good idea.</p>
<p>(6) According to Article 81 of the draft constitution, if the president or vice-president of the Judicial Yuan or the Examination Yuan resigns due to an accident during the adjournment of the National Assembly, the president shall appoint an acting president with the consent of the National Committee. However, if a legislative or control committee member resigns before the expiration of his three-year term, how should he be replaced? After reading the draft constitution, there is no explicit provision. Article 58, Paragraph 3, clearly states that the Control Yuan can propose the impeachment of legislative and control committee members, but when the National Committee accepts the impeachment, the impeached person cannot be treated as an example for the Premier of the Executive Yuan and resign. Then, it is better to give preferential treatment to legislative and control committee members and cancel the above-mentioned words "impeachment by the Control Yuan." If legislative and control committee members have major faults, the two Yuan can punish them separately.</p>
<p>(7) (A) Article 77 of the draft constitution states, "Citizens of the Republic of China who are 45 years of age or older may be elected as president or vice-president." Given the solemn status of the president and vice-president of a country, it seems incomprehensible that their eligibility requirements are far less stringent than those of the National Committee members and alternate members. The qualifications for president stipulated in the 1923 Constitution of the Republic of China were "[Citizens of the Republic of China who are over 40 years of age, enjoy civil rights, and have resided in the country for more than ten years]." Article 62 of Zhang's draft is based on this and is more appropriate than the current draft. (B) The warlord politics that harm civil rights should not be revived. Mr. Zhang Zhiben once lamented this. Article 62 of his draft constitution states, "If a soldier has not retired for three years, his election (as president) is invalid." Preventing problems before they arise is a heartfelt statement. Article 135 of the current draft states, "Soldiers may not be candidates for governor unless they have been discharged from military service for three years." The meaning is the same. Why is it not the same for the president? (C) According to Article 98, the president may submit a resolution of the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration before it is promulgated. However, the scope of the submission for reconsideration is limited to the entire or part of the original proposal. Whether the president can freely deliberate and decide is of great importance and should be clearly stipulated. (D) Commentators compare the president in the draft constitution to a food-bearing official or a dowry maid. In fact, it is even more similar to describe the vice-president with these eight characters. The vice-president in the draft constitution has nothing to do except when the president is vacant. According to Article 58, Paragraph 2, it is even possible to be impeached by the Control Yuan, which is ridiculous. Among the countries in the world that have a vice-president, such as the United States and Switzerland, their vice-presidents have considerable powers. The vice-president of the United States also serves as the president of the Senate. Although it is a nominal position, there are still some routine matters to handle. The vice-president of Switzerland is a member of the Federal Council and also serves as the head of a department. The president and vice-president both serve a term of one year. By convention, the vice-president succeeds the president after the president's term expires. Therefore, the powers of the Swiss vice-president far exceed those of the US vice-president, and are even less comparable to the vice-president in our draft constitution. We believe that the vice-presidency must not be placed in an idle position. Therefore, it is necessary to give it considerable duties. Otherwise, it is better not to set up a vice-president like Zhang's draft. Zhang's draft states, "If the president is unable to perform his duties for any reason, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act on his behalf." However, the term of acting shall be in accordance with Article 83 of the current reform, "not exceeding six months."</p>
<p>(8) Whether the relationship between the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries and committees should be the relationship between the cabinet premier and cabinet members of a responsible cabinet is worthy of attention. Article 96 of the draft constitution states that the Legislative Yuan has the power to question and propose a vote of no confidence if it considers the political facilities and the execution of laws by the [Executive Yuan] to be inappropriate. However, Article 86, Paragraph 1, states that only the [Premier of the Executive Yuan] is removed from office due to the acceptance of a vote of no confidence by the National Committee. The heads of the various ministries and committees do not bear joint responsibility. In other words, all political facilities and the execution of laws by the Executive Yuan are the sole responsibility of the Premier to the Legislative Yuan and the National Committee. However, according to Article 87, the administrative powers of the Executive Yuan are divided among the various ministries and committees. Article 90 states that the important matters of the Executive Yuan are also decided by the Executive Council. The Executive Council is jointly organized by the Premier and the heads of the various ministries and committees. The Premier is only the chairman of the meeting. After reading the above articles, I feel that the powers and responsibilities of the Premier of the Executive Yuan are not balanced. For example, foreign affairs are indeed one of the political facilities of the Executive Yuan. If the facilities are inappropriate, the Premier of the Executive Yuan is solely responsible, while the Minister of Foreign Affairs can sleep soundly. How can this be fair? We believe that if the heads of the various ministries and committees do not bear joint responsibility with the Premier of the Executive Yuan, then they must bear individual and direct responsibility to the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Accordingly, it seems that the six words "submit to the National Government" in Article 88 should be deleted.</p>
<p>(9) (A) The Legislative Yuan in the draft constitution is still a unicameral system, which is inconsistent with the general practice of parliamentary organization in various countries since the 19th century. It is not easy for a unicameral legislative body to discover and correct its own mistakes. Even if there is impeachment by the Control Yuan, it is only a post-hoc supervision and cannot be a pre-hoc correction. Today, those who praise the bicameral system say that it can prevent the autocracy of the legislative body, reduce the abuses of hasty legislation, and mediate the fierce conflict between the legislative body and the executive body. All of these are facts and cannot be denied. Moreover, since the standards of legislative committee members in Article 94 of the draft constitution adopt both professional representation and regional representation, it cannot be like the All-Russian Soviet Congress organized by purely professional representatives, which still maintains the unicameral system without change. In the future, after abolishing the unicameral system and adopting the bicameral system, the legislative committee members of professional representatives will organize the upper house, and the legislative committee members of regional representatives will organize the lower house. However, to fully promote the advantages of the professional representation system, we should make a bottom-up plan and change the election law of the National Assembly representatives in Article 47, so that it adopts both professional representation and regional representation. Then, the legislative committee members elected by professional representatives will organize the upper house, and the legislative committee members elected by regional representatives will organize the lower house. Since the election of legislative committee members adopts both professional representation and regional representation, its benefit is only limited to the Legislative Yuan. It is better to adopt both professional representation and regional representation when electing National Assembly representatives, so that its benefit can be injected into the entire political mechanism. The Weimar Constitution of Germany also adopts both professional representation and regional representation, but outside the two houses of parliament, a central economic Liao is organized separately. Some people call it a tricameral system. Article 31 of the draft constitution states, "Labor and capital should develop productive enterprises based on the principle of consultation and mutual benefit." However, there is no central mechanism specifically for labor-capital cooperation, such as the Central Economic Court of Germany, which is a deficiency. In the future, whether the organization of the Legislative Yuan should be bicameral or tricameral is most appropriate remains to be studied. However, we dare to say that the unicameral system is not as good as the multi-cameral system. (B) The electees of the legislative and control committee members are not limited to the National Assembly representatives, but at least there should be age restrictions.</p>
<p>(10) According to Article 107 of the draft constitution, the Public Service Disciplinary Committee is subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, which is the same as the current system. However, according to Article 11 of the [Public Service Disciplinary Law] promulgated by the National Government on June 8, 1931, if the heads of the various Yuan, ministries, and committees or the highest local administrative officials believe that the public servants under their jurisdiction have violated the law or neglected their duties, they should prepare a document stating the reasons and send it along with the evidence to the Control Yuan for review. However, for public servants below the recommended rank under their jurisdiction, they may directly send it to the Public Service Disciplinary Committee for deliberation. Article 10 of the same law states that the disciplinary organs to which the Control Yuan transfers impeachment cases are divided into the Central Party Headquarters Supervisory Committee, the National Government, and the Central and Provincial Public Service Disciplinary Committees depending on the status of the impeached person. This shows that the current law does not adopt the principle that all impeachment cases are under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan. Therefore, some commentators advocate that the power of adjudication of impeachment cases should be generally vested in the Control Yuan, arguing that it is "one power and sole responsibility." Whether the Public Service Disciplinary Committee should be subordinate to the Control Yuan or the Judicial Yuan remains to be carefully studied.</p>
<p>(11) Strict national supervision of finance is a fundamental way to eliminate corruption and prevent corruption. Article 95 of the draft constitution states that the power to approve the budget belongs to the Legislative Yuan. Article 125 states that the power to review the final accounts and to publish them after the review belongs to the Control Yuan. However, we believe that the budget approval should belong to the National Assembly to show the national intention to supervise finance. Whether the final account audit should maintain the draft constitution method or be jointly responsible for the audit and publication by the Legislative Yuan and the National Government is still debatable.</p>
<p>(12) The equalization of power between the central and local governments is mainly based on the appropriate division of taxation rights. Therefore, Article 64 of the draft constitution should be supplemented to list the national income (such as salt tax, customs duties, tobacco and alcohol tax, stamp tax, etc. Article 29, Paragraph 1, stipulates that income tax and inheritance tax are collected by the state, which is one example.) and local income. (such as field tax, deed tax, tooth tax, etc.). Article 62 of the Provisional Constitution for the Tutelage Period clearly stipulates that the central government may restrict local taxation by law if there are six abuses: [harming the interests of social public], [harming the source of central revenue], [double taxation], [harming traffic], [unfair taxation for the benefit of one locality and the import of goods from other localities], and [local commodity transit tax]. It is quite concise and should be adopted to eliminate the bad habit of local tyrants arbitrarily levying exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes after implementation.</p>
<p>(13) (A) Article 130 of the draft constitution states that the province is an administrative region directly under the jurisdiction of the central government, but it does not explicitly state to whom or to which organ of the central government the governor should be responsible. According to Article 132, the governor is still indirectly elected by the people, and the county magistrate is directly elected by the county people. Although there is a distinction between direct and indirect, they are both elected by the people. According to Article 147, the county people have the right to directly recall the county magistrate, so it is reasonable for the provincial people to have the right to indirectly recall the governor. However, after reading the articles in Chapter 8, there is no such provision. Article 128, Paragraph 3, and Article 133 of Guo's draft both state that the provincial people have the right to indirectly recall the governor, which is more appropriate. (B) Direct election of the governor is closer to the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>(14) (A) Articles 141 and 150 of the draft constitution state that the people of the county and city have the right to exercise the right of recall according to law. However, how the right of recall should be exercised for county and city council officials is worthy of attention and should be clearly stipulated in the draft constitution. (B) The county budget, final accounts, and audit matters all belong to one organ of the county council, which is prone to abuses and should be appropriately divided. (C) According to Article 146, the county magistrate is under the command of the governor and executes the central administrative affairs. If the county magistrate disobeys the governor's command, what can the governor do? If the county magistrate is only responsible to the governor, then the county's autonomy will lose its practical value. Now, for the sake of compromise, it is proposed to change the county magistrate to be elected by three people from the county people, and one person is designated by the governor.</p>
<p>(15) (A) Article 153 of the draft constitution still adopts the mayor system, which is not as in line with the trend as the city manager system. The city manager should be appointed by the city council from among those who have passed the central examination. The mayor under the city manager system is elected by the city council members. (B) Article 154 states that the mayor executes the central administrative affairs under the command of the supervisory organ. The four words "supervisory organ" are very vague and should clearly indicate which organ is responsible for supervision.</p>
<p>(16) According to Article 156 of the draft constitution, the interpretation of this constitution is proposed by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the National Assembly or the National Committee for decision. Mr. Su Songfen's explanation of this article states that he is afraid that the National Assembly and the National Committee may not easily understand the key to interpreting the constitution. Therefore, he advocates that the Legislative Yuan should first propose its opinions. It can be seen that the National Assembly and the National Committee's exercise of the power of interpretation is very easily controlled by the Legislative Yuan. If the legislative organ of the state wields the actual power to interpret the fundamental law, where will the correction come from if the legislation violates the constitution? The abuses of this are obvious and need no further explanation. Wu's draft advocates the establishment of a national court, which not only can interpret constitutional ambiguities (Article 20, Paragraph 1), but also further review unconstitutional laws and declare them invalid (Article 20, Paragraph 2), dispose of unconstitutional acts (Article 20, Paragraph 3), and resolve other political events that directly or indirectly violate the constitution and cannot be resolved by ordinary courts (Article 20, Paragraph 9). The articles are meticulous and commendable, and are far better than the US Supreme Court, which requires a formal request from the people and has unconstitutional facts as the object before making an interpretation of constitutional ambiguities. The draft constitution does not adopt it, which is not thorough. (B) Article 158 of the draft constitution states that this constitution cannot be amended unless it is resolved by the National Assembly. That is to say, it cannot be amended during the adjournment of the National Assembly, which is too restrictive. Comparative activities can be used as a reference.</p>
<p>(17) Looking at the various articles in the draft constitution itself, there are also some that are not very meticulous or consistent. I will list a few examples below. (A) The words "interpretation" should be added after the words "system" in Article 51, Paragraph 1, to correspond to Article 157. (B) Article 58, Paragraph 3, should be changed to "[...] for the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various Yuan of the Judicial Yuan [...]". (C) It seems appropriate to add an article before or after Article 59, "[The exercise of the powers of the National Assembly and the National Committee shall be determined by law]". (D) In Article 86, Paragraphs 1 and 2, the five words "National Assembly or" should be added above the five words "National Committee". Otherwise, during the adjournment of the National Assembly, the Premier of the Executive Yuan can be safe and sound even if he is distrusted or impeached by the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan. (E) In Article 146, the six words "under the supervision of the governor" should be added after the two words "county magistrate" to correspond to Article 136. (F) The two words "recall" can be added after the five words "election of the county magistrate" in Article 148.</p>

<p>(Qingdao) Since Chairman Chiang advocated for the New Life Movement, the entire country, in view of the nation's precarious situation and the decline of the national spirit, wants to seek salvation. It is believed that revitalizing the national spirit, emphasizing propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and changing the people's bad habits are essential. Therefore, party and government organs in various regions have initiated this movement one after another, almost throughout the country. The Municipal Party Affairs Consolidation Committee believes that this matter concerns the revival of the national movement and is also actively preparing to hold it. In recent days, it has made every effort to collect a great deal of materials on this movement from all parties and presented them to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, requesting that the relevant materials be sent as much as possible for reference. After preparations are completed, the committee plans to immediately convene all sectors of the city to organize a New Life Movement Promotion Association to jointly promote it and achieve practical results.

<h3>French and German Replies Delivered to London: Disagreement Remains on Disarmament</h3>
<p>France politely declines the British plan due to national security concerns.</p>
<p>Germany can rejoin the League of Nations, but only after resolving disarmament issues.</p>
<p>British mediation is futile.</p>
<p>(London) The disarmament notes from France and Germany were both delivered to the British government today.</p>
<p>The French note, passed by the cabinet, was forwarded by the French ambassador to London to the British authorities. The note is worded very mildly, stating that if France's security is not threatened, France does not oppose the principle of disarmament, but cannot accept the British plan, as it would allow Germany to have the right to rearm with equal military equipment to France and does not guarantee France's security. What is needed now is a European mechanism to prevent the violation of disarmament conventions and prevent all acts of aggression.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is the only peace mechanism. The League of Nations is the only mechanism capable of maintaining peace. If Germany rejoins the League of Nations, it will be proof of its sincerity, and disarmament discussions can continue. Germany has violated the Treaty of Versailles and rearmed, and its demands for armaments and military force contradict the principles passed by the Disarmament Conference. France is willing to accept the British proposal to abolish the world's air force, but if some countries are allowed to rearm their land forces, demands for naval expansion will inevitably follow. (Dispatch from the 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The note also insists that when comparing the military strength of various countries, all military organizations, whether carrying weapons or not, must be considered formal troops. According to those familiar with the situation, the purpose of this final clause is directed at [the German Brownshirts] and [the Italian Blackshirts]. France solemnly declares that, except for the recent effort to build a group, the so-called French Party, France has not previously had similar organizations. However, even with the recent French Party, there is no prospect of progress. British officials were deeply surprised after France submitted its note to London expressing its attitude towards Germany, as France and Italy had a formal agreement on Germany's request to increase armaments. It is widely believed that the Italian-French agreement represents a considerable concession from France, as France believes that if Germany does not increase its [offensive military equipment], France will not object to Germany maintaining a certain amount of defensive military equipment. (Dispatch from the 18th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>The German note is a response to France's memorandum of February 15, which rejected all of Germany's demands. Its wording is also very mild. It is said that Germany firmly believes that harmony has its prerequisites, and what is needed is determination. France seems to have misunderstandings on certain points. It also stated that the issue of Germany's relationship with the League of Nations can be discussed after the disarmament issue is resolved. Germany believes that there are two ways to reach an agreement: to establish a five-year armistice agreement or to establish a longer-term partial disarmament plan agreement. (Dispatch from the 18th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Germany's Reply to France</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's reply to France's memorandum on disarmament was delivered to the French ambassador to Germany on March 13, and its full text was only released today. The general meaning is as follows: The French memorandum of February 14 stated that the two governments had found different opinions on several key points of the disarmament issue, but both governments sincerely hoped that the disarmament conference could be convened as soon as possible to continue exchanging opinions on this issue. The German government delayed its response to the French memorandum because the British government was holding a meeting to discuss and solicit opinions from various governments on this issue. Germany hereby expresses its gratitude, as in this situation, the German government had to wait for the results of this meeting to adopt them.</p>
<p>Requesting the elimination of four misunderstandings. The German government believes that the various statements claimed in the French memorandum may have been misunderstood regarding Germany's previous declarations. At future meetings, it is expected to attract significant attention, and it is hoped that all misunderstandings can be eliminated at that time. The misunderstood items are roughly divided into the following four points: (1) The French government did not fully understand the meaning of the [non-aggression treaty] proposed by Germany in its memorandum of January 19, which coincided with the original intention of the [Locarno] Treaty. The German government's response to this point was clearly stated in the new German foreign policy, and in the joint declaration of Germany and Poland on January 26, it was also firmly expressed that Germany would never resort to force under any circumstances. Therefore, the German government hereby formally declares that once the disarmament issue is formally resolved, Germany will begin to discuss its future relationship with the League of Nations with the great powers. (2) The French memorandum strongly claimed that Germany's proposal was based on a false observation, that the German government believed that effective disarmament was impossible today. Today, the German government formally declares that the various countries with abundant military equipment are strengthening their military preparations without any restrictions on the addition of their military equipment, and there have been no disarmament proposals whose sincerity is far less than that of Germany. What is particularly noteworthy is that the French government has not yet had any proposals to promote the realization of disarmament, while the future limits of Germany's military equipment were formulated in the declaration of the five great powers in December 1932. (3) The French government's criticism of the supervision issue mentioned in Germany's memorandum of January 10 is still based on misunderstanding. The purpose of Germany's suggestion to establish international supervision is nothing more than to balance the military equipment of all countries. The supervision of this military equipment only needs to formulate regulations, and there is no difficulty. Therefore, Germany sincerely hopes that the supervision of this military equipment must be realized.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the organization of German political parties, the German government believes that this organization has no military meaning at all. However, the French government has different opinions on this. It seems that a kind of regulation may as well be formulated to ban political parties in other countries. Is it so? The German government believes that banning political parties is really not necessary. The French government can avoid suspicion and doubt. Germany will never risk the great impropriety of suppressing the disarmament conference by violence and then adopting force. In addition to explaining the misunderstandings, the reply finally pointed out two points, saying that Germany's army would soon be equipped with weapons for self-defense, and also said that the great powers that own overseas colonies can recall their troops to their home countries at any time to fight, so the amount of this military equipment is actually unbalanced in comparison. Finally, it also said that when the disarmament conference is held, Germany will propose a minimum amount of self-defense military equipment. (Dispatch from the 17th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>Agree to universal restrictions on armaments. The memorandum also states that Germany agrees to the universal restriction of armaments, that is, to prohibit the establishment of various armed groups or similar armed groups in addition to the formal army. However, a certain section of the memorandum implies that Germany still insists on establishing a standing army of 300,000 people, which is what the German parliament previously requested. The memorandum continues to say that in the future, when comparing the military strength of France and Germany, the troops in France and the troops in French colonies must be taken into consideration. Here, Germany, in the style of a heartfelt appeal, requests to be allowed to fully equip its military equipment for self-defense, and says that this request cannot be delayed any longer or discussed meaninglessly.</p>
<p>Advocate convening two kinds of meetings. Regarding the world disarmament issue, the memorandum suggests convening two kinds of consecutive meetings. The first meeting will limit the countries with sufficient military equipment from exceeding the current state of their military equipment within five years. The second meeting includes a longer period of time and will seek the actual reduction of the existing military equipment of the great powers. It is said that what we want is the second meeting, but the first meeting is established because it is simple and practically easy for all countries to accept and reach an agreement. Whether in the first meeting or the second meeting, the increase in military equipment suggested by Germany will always remain unchanged. Germany has repeatedly stated this in the memorandum.</p>
<p>Implying the hope of rejoining the League of Nations. From a political point of view, the memorandum's mention of the League of Nations is a sign that Germany will rejoin the League of Nations when its request to increase military equipment is satisfied. Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, the news of rejoining the League of Nations has never been spread. If so, it is from this time. (Dispatch from the 18th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Prepares to Join the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Has obtained full understanding from the United States and France.</p>
<p>League of Nations General Assembly to be convened in April</p>

<p>(Paris) According to the news published in the newspaper by the famous journalist Taibo Yi, who is familiar with diplomatic and political situations, a complete understanding has been reached between France and the United States and Russia regarding Russia's joining the League of Nations, and it is said that negotiations between the two governments will be completed soon. It is said that Soviet Russia's joining the League of Nations may not have to wait until the 9th of this month, but a special procedure can be adopted, and France has agreed to submit a motion for Soviet Russia to join at the League of Nations General Assembly to be convened on April 10.

<h3>Japan Publicly Tears Up International Trade Convention</h3>
<p>Ensuring freedom of commerce as the reason</p>
<p>Hirota announces to the League of Nations that it will no longer be bound</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British and Japanese governments have submitted a trade protection bill to this session of parliament in order to ensure foreign commercial rights. In order to strengthen this plan, Foreign Minister Hirota issued a notice to Mr. Yokoyama, acting director of the Japanese Affairs Bureau of the Geneva International Conference, on the 17th, [stating that the Japanese government intends to release the treaty obligations that prohibit, restrict, or abolish exports and imports from now on, and instructed to forward this intention to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the main points of the instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>In order to open up the world's economic difficulties and promote world prosperity, the Japanese government has decided to remove all obstacles that hinder international trade in order to restore world trade, and is convinced that this important plan cannot be ignored, and hopes that the economic cooperation of various countries will become closer, so as to realize the reality of coexistence and co-prosperity. Based on this hope as a principle and aiming to restore the freedom of international trade, Japan has participated in the previous treaty and its resolutions. Now that all countries in the world are in the autumn of economic difficulties, they have no time to consider the overall situation, but are only moving towards their own policies. Recently, this tendency has become more and more obvious, so we have to withdraw from the treaty and its resolutions, which is inevitable. Although Japan wants to continue to participate in the treaty, the freedom of world commerce is not only insufficient to ensure it, but now countries are arbitrarily raising tariffs, prohibiting the import of foreign goods, and increasing obstacles to commerce. Therefore, Japan's export trade is greatly affected. Recently, there have been counter-measures to resist Japanese goods in relation to various countries, and the regrettable points are obvious. The currency and economic conferences are currently in a state of indefinite adjournment. Therefore, the Japanese government has now decided to restore its freedom to implement all measures deemed necessary in order to protect its interests, and to implement a relationship that is separate from the resolutions. It is said that after the declaration of withdrawal, it will take effect after one month. (Dispatch from the 18th, Japanese Allied News)</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Build Large Radio Stations in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyushu</h3>
<p>Conducting a Broadcasting War Against Foreign Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The radio broadcasting of countries around the world has recently turned to large-powerism, and the aerial propaganda war is in full swing. In view of this, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, under the guidance of the Ministry of Communications and the Army and Navy authorities, plans to establish a large-power broadcasting station, and has decided to start construction as a new project for Showa 9. It will submit an application to the Ministry of Communications for approval within a few days. The broadcasting power of the new broadcasting station is ten to fifteen times the current maximum broadcasting power in Japan, about 100 kilowatts to 150 kilowatts. The construction sites are selected in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyushu. After completion, Japan will also participate in the international radio war with various countries, and will not be at a loss to Nanjing's anti-Japanese broadcasting.</p>

<h3>Austria Is No Different From the Second Switzerland After the Rome Agreement Was Signed</h3>
<p>Italy Looks Down on Central Europe</p>
<p>Austria's Independence Is Guaranteed</p>
<p>Rome The main influence of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian agreement is to bind Austria, which must consult with Italy before any action can be taken to abandon its independence, such as alliance with Germany. Although no formal letters were sent to other countries inviting them to join this agreement, the public nature of this agreement is very clear. On the political side, its consultative clauses are even more satirical, clearly expressing the respect of various countries for Austria's independence, turning Austria into a second Switzerland. This is a major step to protect Italy's security. Therefore, the triangular agreement signed yesterday is seen by people in Rome as a victory for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's policy, as the Italian Prime Minister wants to prevent any one or several countries from dominating Central Europe. The convention was scheduled to be signed at 4:00 PM, but the transcription of the text took time, so it was not signed until 5:08 PM.</p>
<h3>There Are Three Agreements</h3>
<p>A communiqué was issued shortly after, stating that three agreements were signed. The first agreement stipulates that the heads of the three countries will be responsible for acting in concert with each other on specific issues and general issues related to them, in order to pursue a policy aimed at promoting effective cooperation between European countries, especially between Italy, Hungary, and Austria. The three countries are convinced that this can establish a true foundation for great cooperation with other countries. The other two agreements expand the existing commercial agreements between Italy and Hungary and Austria to facilitate mutual exports and develop their national economies, and stipulate (1) preferential treatment for Austrian industrial products, (2) the establishment of a plan to remedy the difficulties caused by the low grain prices in Hungary, and (3) the development of transport and transportation through the Adriatic seaports.</p>
<h3>Details Awaiting Discussion</h3>
<p>The representatives of the three countries will convene in Rome on April 5th. The experts are currently discussing the detailed regulations regarding preferential treatment and quotas for goods, the free zones of Austria-Hungary in [Trieste] and [Fiume], and the methods of payment between the three countries. This kind of bilateral new agreement must be completed before May 15th. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Pen Breaks at Signing</h3>
<p>Rome: The signing ceremony took place in the Venice Palace. During the signing, Mr. Gömbös's pen suddenly broke. Mr. Mussolini immediately provided him with another pen, and he was able to complete his signature. It is reported that the political agreement of the three agreements is of great significance to the political situation of Central European countries. The other two economic agreements are trade agreements between Italy and Hungary and Austria, which stipulate that Italy will give special [tariff preferential treatment] to Austria's industrial products and Hungary's wheat exports. Austria-Hungary will do everything possible to help develop the commodities of the two countries passing through the ports of [Trieste] and [Fiume]. This agreement was made by Mr. Mussolini to avoid large-scale combinations of world powers. According to Mr. Mussolini, this result is very satisfactory. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Distinguished Guests Triumphant Return</h3>
<p>The news that the three political and economic agreements between Italy, Hungary, and Austria have been signed has spread throughout Europe. Recently, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss returned to their respective capitals at 9:10 pm on the 17th. Those who came to the station to see them off included Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich, and other important personnel. It is reported that Mr. Dollfuss will return to Vienna via Venice and Trieste, while Mr. Gömbös will take a special express train directly back to the Hungarian capital. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Important Diplomatic Speech</h3>
<p>Successfully Announces Central European Policy and Good Neighborly Opinions</p>
<p>Disregards Disarmament and Cherishes the Ambition to Expand Influence</p>
<p>Rome: Mussolini delivered a speech to the future candidates for the House of Representatives, strongly advocating the concrete value of pan-nationalism, and then studied Italy's relations with its neighboring countries.</p>
<h3>Italy and Switzerland</h3>
<p>He said that he was prepared to extend the treaty signed between Italy and Switzerland in 1924.</p>
<h3>Italy and Austria</h3>
<p>He also said that Italy will be able to help Austria to ensure its independence and improve its economy.</p>
<h3>Italy and Serbia</h3>
<p>As for the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia, there are no flaws in diplomacy. If economic interests are added, the relations between the two countries may be further improved. However, the problems between the two countries must be considered after the necessary conditions are met.</p>
<h3>Italy and France</h3>
<p>The general relations between Italy and France have improved, but none of the various problems between Italy and France have been resolved. However, since the relationship between the two countries has improved in spirit, the development of future relations between the two countries will naturally be easier.</p>
<h3>Italy and Hungary</h3>
<p>Mussolini said, "[Some of Hungary's land, which is actually the land of the Magyar people (i.e., Hungarians), has been taken away by others.]" Italy deeply understands Hungary's feelings for its homeland. The protocol recently signed in Rome can be joined by other countries to form a broad cooperation. The signatory countries do not refuse.</p>
<h3>League of Nations</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister then advocated that the League of Nations should be reformed, but said that it should be done after the disarmament conference is successful. The main goal of the disarmament conference has now failed step by step. If it fails completely, this kind of transformation seems unnecessary, because it is useless to fail the disarmament conference first and then bankrupt the League of Nations. Furthermore, countries that violate the Treaty of Versailles and arm themselves cannot oppose the application of the right to equal armaments to Germany if they do not engage in disarmament. Since we cannot use force to prevent Germany from rearming, we should recognize Germany's demands for rearmament and expansion of military strength. The speech of Belgian Prime Minister Broqueville can serve as a sign.</p>
<h3>Disarmament</h3>
<p>As for Italy, it cannot move forward on the path of disarmament, because the disarmament conference is now in a stalemate. Italy has a sacred duty to defend the country, so it must make its military power strong, but its purpose is to deal with all incidents, not to attack others.</p>
<h3>To Other Nations</h3>
<p>In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that Italy's sincere cooperation with other nations is sufficient to maintain peace. In terms of geographical location, Italy is a complete island country, but Italy has its future, its historical goals, for the Mediterranean, for Africa, and Asia. However, what it seeks is not to invade land, but to promote culture and develop the economy. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>US Airmail Death Rate</h3>
<p>Increases to Eleven</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the death rate of military airmail has increased to eleven. The plane of Captain Lee Jia-sheng crashed in the sky, the fuselage was completely destroyed, and Mr. Lee also died. It is found that Mr. Lee was only twenty-six years old, and he was recently appointed as a pilot of the military airmail. Since February 17, a total of eleven military airmail pilots have died. The White House deeply regrets this tragedy, and President Roosevelt believes that many pilot accidents are mostly due to excessive anxiety and eagerness to express the effectiveness of military service.

<h3>Soviet Russia Intensifies Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Assists Land and Air in Defending the Border</p>
<p>Naval Strength is More Than Enough to Destroy the Enemy</p>
<p>(Moscow) It is said that Soviet Russia is now preparing for frontier sea and land defense to prevent enemy invasion. Shipbuilding companies in the Far East, the Black Sea, and the North are now stepping up their work. No country in the world adheres to the shipbuilding plan as strictly as Soviet Russia. Britain and the United States have intelligence agencies dedicated to investigating the strength of the Soviet fleet, but the information obtained is still unreliable. However, when the Communist Party held a representative conference, Soviet Russia's Minister of the Army, Voroshilov, made a report on the Soviet Navy, saying that a very large fleet is under urgent construction. The Northern Baltic Fleet and the Southern Black Sea Fleet have recently undergone a large expansion. At the same time, a completely new Far East Fleet has also been organized to defend the coastal provinces of Soviet Russia from being attacked. According to Voroshilov, the organization of the Far East Fleet is purely a light auxiliary ship, without aircraft carriers. It is feared that the Soviet fleet is working closely with the land air force, because Army Minister Voroshilov said that the Soviet Union's auxiliary ships and air force are sufficient to defeat any attacking enemy. The figures announced by the Soviet Navy can be found in its report to the Disarmament Conference. It is said that the Soviet fleet includes a total of 61 ships, with a total of 169,719 tons of battleships. The classification of the fleet is as follows: four flagships, three cruisers, twenty-six battleships, twenty submarines, two mine-laying ships, and six mine-sweeping ships. However, it is certainly credible that the strength of the Soviet fleet is stronger than the above-mentioned published figures. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia and Sweden Establish Commercial Agreement</h3>
<p>Sweden Lends Russia a Huge Sum</p>
<p>Purchases Swedish Goods in Four Installments</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden: Soviet Russia and Sweden have reached an agreement that Sweden will lend money to Soviet Russia to purchase Swedish goods. This agreement will only take effect after it is passed by the Swedish Parliament. The Swedish government has submitted this agreement to both houses for approval. According to this agreement, Sweden will lend 100 million kronor to Soviet Russia, but Soviet Russia must use the full amount of this loan to purchase Swedish goods before the end of April 1935. Soviet Russia's orders are divided into four phases. The first phase is the end of July this year, and the amount of Soviet Russia's purchases must reach 30 million kronor. The second phase is from July to the end of October, and Soviet Russia must also purchase 30 million kronor during this time (60 million kronor in total with the first phase). The third phase is from the end of October to the end of January next year, and Soviet Russia should purchase 20 million kronor within these three months (a total of 80 million kronor including the first and second phases). The fourth phase is from January to the end of April, and Soviet Russia must use up the remaining 20 million (a total of 100 million kronor in four phases). Among the goods purchased in the first phase, agricultural products should be included at 15 million kronor. Soviet Russia also reserves a right, that is, the price demanded by Swedish sellers must not exceed the usual market price before Soviet Russia can purchase. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Incident of Russian Plane Landing in Jilin Territory Falsely Accused, Protest Lodged with Russia</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Shi Nili, the puppet state's diplomatic representative, visited the Soviet Consul General, Slatsky, yesterday and handed over a letter of protest regarding the plane problem. The general idea was that on March 11, a Soviet military plane illegally flew over the eastern border of Manchuria and landed in the territory, which was an infringement of the territorial rights of [Manchukuo]. Netz was instructed by the [Manchukuo] government to protest severely. Your country's planes have repeatedly crossed the border. This landing proves the existence of illegal acts. We urge your country to reflect deeply. (Telecommunications dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan Takes Further Steps to Swallow the Northeast, Chinese Farmers Have No Land to Stand On</h3>
<p>Creating the So-Called [Land Holding Company]</p>
<p>Implementing Land Grabbing to Promote Japanese Immigration</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs plans to organize a land holding company after the parliamentary session to actively immigrate to our Eastern Province and attempt to grab the land of our Eastern Province. The content of the company's plan is as follows: (1) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs takes the initiative to establish the Manchurian Land Holding Company based on the land that the South Manchuria Railway Company is stepping up to purchase in Manchuria. (2) The capital is set at 20 million yuan, called a joint venture between Japan and Manchuria. The Manchurian side contributes 10 million yuan, using confiscated land and state-owned land as capital. The Japanese side provides 10 million yuan from the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Oriental Development Company. (3) Allow Japanese farmers to immigrate freely, but group immigration is the principle. (4) The company will not distribute dividends for the time being, because it is called a national policy company. (5) The company leases the land to immigrants to operate or sells it to immigrants. The financial needs of immigrants are provided by the Oriental Development Company. Although this company is called a company, it is actually a land-grabbing machine. The current method of land grabbing in the Eastern Province is that the South Manchuria Railway Company's investigators, together with the special commissioners of the Kwantung Army's special service department, go to various places to rent fertile land, and even make the county governments issue notices, ordering landowners to register within a time limit, re-collect registration fees, or re-levy land rents. If landowners fail to complete the procedures within the time limit, the land will be confiscated. In this way, the land of Chinese farmers gradually falls into the hands of the Japanese. After the establishment of this company, the future of Chinese farmers will be even more unimaginable. (China United Press communication, 18th)</p>

<p>Wang Yongbin's Opinions on the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>= Criticism of Limiting to Only One Month is Too Hasty =</p>
<p>= Its Spirit Does Not Accord with the Testament and Constitutional Studies =</p>
<p>= Promulgation Procedures May Face Many Forced Interpretations in the Future =</p>
<p>Since the initial draft of the Constitution was published by the Legislative Yuan on March 1st, with a one-month period set for public commentary, a reporter from the Central News Agency, considering the Constitution as the fundamental law of the nation of great importance, visited Mr. Wang Yongbin yesterday. Given Wang's years of service in legislative affairs and his role as a drafting member of the Temple of Heaven Constitution draft, they specifically sought his personal opinions. According to his brief discussion: [Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of this Party decided in December of the 21st year of the Republic to convene the National Assembly in March of the 24th year of the Republic to promulgate the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan, under the leadership of President Sun, began drafting the Constitution. After several months of effort by the Constitution Drafting Committee, the initial draft was completed, totaling ten chapters and one hundred and sixty articles. The chapters and sections are complete, and the wording is neat and tidy, truly unmatched by any previous draft. However, regarding the content, there are still areas open to criticism, which should be addressed in detail at a later date. Today, I wish to offer only three points as my personal opinion. First, the Legislative Yuan published the initial draft, welcoming public criticism, but limiting the period to only one month is too short. Given the vastness of China and the inconvenience of transportation, in one month, remote areas may not even have seen the initial draft, and the deadline will have passed. After the initial draft is discussed and approved by the Legislative Yuan, it must be publicized among the people for selection, in accordance with the Principles of National Reconstruction. However, the people's opinions on the draft thereafter can only be expressed through representatives to the National Assembly. According to the draft's provisions, the National Assembly will have two thousand representatives and a one-month session. Considering the one hundred and sixty articles of the draft Constitution, there may be no room for leisurely discussion and revision other than complete acceptance. Thus, the opinions of the people nationwide on the draft Constitution will have no opportunity for expression beyond criticizing the initial draft this month. Therefore, if the Legislative Yuan sincerely wishes for the people to criticize the initial draft, the deadline for criticism should be at least three to four months. Second, Article 22 of the Principles of National Reconstruction clearly stipulates that the draft Constitution should be based on the Principles of National Reconstruction and the achievements of the periods of Tutelage and Constitutional Government, and be discussed and approved by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan's deliberation of ordinary laws is always subject to the restrictions of the legislative principles of the Political Council, while the draft Constitution has the freedom to be discussed and approved because it has the highest principles of the draft Constitution as indicated by the Premier's Principles of National Reconstruction and the Five-Power Constitution. Now that the period of Tutelage has not yet been completed and the period of Constitutional Government has not yet begun, there are naturally no achievements to speak of, but the teachings of the Principles of National Reconstruction and the Five-Power Constitution are brilliant and cannot be disregarded. The spirit of the Five-Power Constitution lies entirely in separating the constituent parts of the sovereign organ and people's representatives that are mixed in the parliaments of various countries and entrusting them to the National Assembly, so that it represents the people and exercises the highest political power, relegating the Legislative Yuan to a part of the administrative power organs, sharing power with other Yuan in parallel. The current initial draft greatly reduces the power of the National Assembly, making it meet once every three years for a period of one month, and during its adjournment, its power is delegated to the National Committee, the Legislative Yuan members, and the Control Yuan members, in order to restrain the actions of the Executive Yuan. In the Five-Power separation system, it imitates the frowns of parliamentary politics, neither American nor British, uniquely standing out, which is not only inconsistent with the Premier's teachings, but also poses a problem in comparative constitutional studies. Third, according to the Principles of National Reconstruction, only after each county completes its self-governance can it elect one representative, and only after all the counties in each province complete their self-governance does that province enter the period of Constitutional Government. The National Assembly's representatives are then elected by the various counties that have completed their self-governance. The construction process is orderly and unchaotic. Now, Article 160 of the initial draft stipulates that this Constitution shall be implemented from the date of promulgation, naturally in its entirety, and cannot be implemented in chapters or phases. This means that the convocation of Chapter Five, the National Assembly, and the popular election of Chapter Nine, county and city mayors, will naturally be carried out simultaneously. However, in the Principles of National Reconstruction, the popular election of county and city mayors is the completion of self-governance in that county or city. Due to the promulgation of the Constitution, and the people not being trained and self-governance not being prepared, the period of Tutelage and Constitutional Government will be completed on the same day. In theory and in fact, there are many forced interpretations. Moreover, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to promulgate the Constitution in March of the 24th year of the Republic, while the 396th Central Political Conference passed the principles for improving local self-governance, which are divided into three phases: fostering self-governance, starting self-governance, and completing self-governance. Although the time limits for each phase have not been explicitly defined, they will certainly not be achievable from today until March 1st of next year. This means that on one hand, the Constitution is being drafted at full speed, and on the other hand, self-governance is being fostered leisurely. There is a fear that Constitutional Government will not be quick enough, and a fear that the period of Tutelage will be too quick. As a result, when March of the 24th year of the Republic arrives, Constitutional Government will be completed, while the period of Tutelage will not yet be completed. This will inevitably lead to Constitutional Government being implemented without the period of Tutelage, or Constitutional Government preceding the period of Tutelage, causing changes to the established construction procedures of Article 5 of the Principles of National Reconstruction, which is unknowable. The above, except for the second point which involves the content of the draft Constitution, are merely issues related to the draft Constitution. Due to their importance, they are often overlooked by critics, so I have briefly mentioned them.] (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Actions and Words of Japanese Fleet Commander Imamura in Xiamen</h3>
<p>= Imamura Claims to Secure All of China =</p>
<p>= Also Says the Current State of Sino-Japanese Relations is Good =</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Imamura Nobujiro, Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, recently sailed south from Shanghai on the Izumo warship. He first arrived at Fuzhou, then the Magong military port in Taiwan. On the morning of the 14th, he led the destroyers Tsuga, Hishi, and Kure to Xiamen. Prior to this, Tsukamoto Takeshi, the Japanese Consul in Xiamen, notified the Japanese residents and Taiwanese citizens in Xiamen to hold a grand welcome, and also informed our military and political leaders and business leaders, inviting them to a banquet at that time. The Izumo warship arrived in Xiamen at 7 a.m., docked at Gulangyu. At about 8 a.m., Lin Guogeng, the Commander of the Xiamen Naval Base, along with Aide-de-Camp Jiang Ying, took an electric boat to the Izumo to pay respects to Imamura, and then returned. At 11 a.m., Imamura, along with his staff and Japanese Consul Tsukamoto Takeshi, landed to return the visit to Lin Guogeng, then went to Jiang Dingwen's residence on Tiger Head Mountain to pay respects and inspect the Taiwan Public Association. Then, he went to Nanputuo Temple for sightseeing. In the afternoon, at 4 p.m., he returned to the Japanese Consulate in Gulangyu. At 4:15 p.m., Jiang Dingwen returned the visit.

Our Chinese attendees included Jiang Dingwen, Lin Guogeng, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Zongshi, Jiangzhen Warship Captain Zhang Rizhang, Water Police Bureau Chief Ye Dengying, and Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Chairman Zhang Xiaochun and Chen Ruiqing. During the event, the Japanese Consul introduced Imamura. There were over two hundred guests in total. The President of the Taiwanese Association's speech briefly stated: [The Third Fleet secures all of China and protects overseas Chinese]. Imamura's reply also stated: [This fleet is responsible for securing all of China and protecting overseas Chinese, and I deeply feel the weight of this responsibility], and so on. The event did not end until 10 p.m. On the 15th, Imamura continued to inspect his overseas Chinese organizations and sightsee. At noon, he attended a luncheon at the British Consulate. At 7 p.m., the Japanese Consul hosted a dinner for Imamura and his Chief of Staff, Takamura, etc. Our Chinese attendees included Jiang Dingwen, Lin Guogeng, Xiamen University President Lin Wenqing, Naval Aviation Director Chen Wenlin, Customs Superintendent Xu Fengzao, etc. During the dinner, after the Japanese Consul's speech, Imamura's political speech briefly stated, [The current state of Sino-Japanese friendship is turning for the better, which is truly gratifying for both countries. I hope that we can work harder to achieve more practical friendship, which would be fortunate]. Jiang Dingwen's reply briefly stated, [I have never studied abroad, so I have had few opportunities to meet with various parties. I am very happy to meet you all today. I deeply agree with what Consul Tsukamoto and Commander Imamura have said], and so on. The event ended after 10 p.m. On the afternoon of the 16th, Jiang Dingwen hosted a banquet for Imamura at the Shuzhuang Garden in Gulangyu. Attendees included Imamura, Takamura, Japanese Consul Tsukamoto Takeshi, the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the British warship captain stationed in Xiamen, and Lin Guogeng, Lin Wenqing, Xu Ruilin, Xu Fengzao, Wang Zongshi, Lin Zhencheng, Zhou Xingnan, etc. After Jiang Dingwen's speech, Imamura's thank-you speech included the phrase [Sino-Japanese friendship must be based on morality]. The event ended at 3 p.m. At 4 p.m., Imamura held a tea party on the Izumo warship. Jiang Dingwen and Lin Guogeng attended. Many Japanese and Taiwanese also attended. At 4:30 p.m., Jiang and others bid farewell. Upon parting, Imamura asked Jiang and Lin to leave calligraphic inscriptions as mementos. Jiang wrote the four characters [Treat each other with sincerity], and Lin wrote the four characters [Loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, and respect]. At 5 p.m., the Izumo warship and the Hishi, Kure, and Tsuga warships left Xiamen for Shantou, scheduled to stay in Shantou for two days, then proceed to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and then go to Magong and return to Shanghai. According to Japanese sources, Imamura's trip south is responsible for the important mission of promoting Sino-Japanese military and civilian relations and working towards peace in East Asia.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Goes to Hankou</h3>
<p>| To See Zhang and Report on the Situation in North China |</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: After Zhang Xueliang relinquished military power in Beiping and went abroad last year, his Northeastern Army, stationed in Hebei, consisted of the four armies of Yu Xuezhong, Wan Fulin, He Zhuguo, and Wang Yizhe, each with about 40,000 to 50,000 soldiers, totaling about 200,000 soldiers. Their monthly military pay was allocated by the Beiping Military Branch. This time, Zhang returned to the country, and the old Northeastern subordinates came to see Zhang one after another. Only Yu Xuezhong and others were unable to leave due to their duties. A few days ago, after Zhang took the position of Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces in Hankou, he specially telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, Wan Fulin, He Zhuguo, and Wang Yizhe to go south for a meeting. Wan, He, and Wang have already gone to Hankou. Yu departed on a special train this morning (16th) at 10 a.m., accompanied by his entourage. When passing through Ping, he will first visit Huang Fu and He Yingqin to report on everything, and then go south on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Due to the Civil Affairs Director Wei Jian's inspection of the disaster areas in southern Hebei, the provincial government's affairs are being handled on his behalf by Provincial Government Secretary-General Cha Yao. The 51st Army's military affairs are being handled on his behalf by Chief of Staff Liu Zhonggan. According to Yu's pre-departure remarks, this trip has no specific mission. Zhang is an old superior, and he has not yet met him since returning to the country, so he is personally going to Hankou for a reunion, and to report on the current situation here. (March 16th)</p>
<h3>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Thoughts and Personality (Continued)</h3>
<p>| Chiang Kai-shek's Speech at the Memorial Service for Dr. Sun's Death |</p>
<p>Eighth, [The Principle of People's Livelihood and Communism have the same goal, but their philosophical foundation and practical methods are completely different. Dr. Sun said that Communism is the ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the implementation of Communism. He also said that Marx was a social pathologist, not a social physiologist. These four sentences are the most important maxims for those who study the Principle of People's Livelihood.] This point is the most concise description of the similarities and differences between the Principle of People's Livelihood and Communism, according to the maxims that Dr. Sun told us. In the past, the Communist Party took Dr. Sun's sentence [The Principle of People's Livelihood is Communism] out of context to deceive people, ignoring the two maxims that Dr. Sun said [Communism is the ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the implementation of Communism]. When we look at these two sentences, we can understand that Dr. Sun's true intention was to recognize that Communism and the Principle of People's Livelihood have the same ultimate goal, but their philosophical foundation and practical methods are different. The Principle of People's Livelihood is based on the philosophy of people's livelihood, using the methods of restraining private capital, developing state capital, equalizing land ownership, and harmonizing the interests of various social classes to enable them to cooperate and advance together, stemming from the spirit of [loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace]. Communism is based on mechanical materialism, using class struggle, proletarian dictatorship, i.e., various improper means such as murder and arson that uncivilized humans should not have, stemming from the psychology of jealousy, hatred, cruelty, and revenge. May I ask how these uncivilized means can achieve the goal of Communism and realize the world of the Great Unity of the people, by the people, and for the people? Communism advocates class struggle, wanting to kill each other. May I ask what is there to talk about Communism and a Great Unity society if all the people are killed? Its doctrine wants to make humans kill each other, which is so cruel and barbaric. Therefore, if we want to truly realize Communism and build a world of Great Unity, we must realize Dr. Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood and break Marx's false Communism.</p>
<p>Ninth, [Dr. Sun's entire personality is based on benevolence and love. All expressions are nothing but benevolence and love. He had superior intelligence, but his intelligence was used to promote harmony and benevolence. He had superior courage, but his courage was only used to practice benevolence. It can be seen that without benevolence and love, there is no revolution to speak of. People's livelihood is the expression of the great virtue of the universe, and benevolence and love are the foundation of the philosophy of people's livelihood. All other moralities are born from this and complete the use of benevolence and love.] This final point speaks of Dr. Sun's great revolutionary personality from the perspective of his basic thoughts, using the two characters of benevolence and love to indicate the foundation of Dr. Sun's revolutionary personality and the overall motivation and overall goal of all expressions. We know that the words that Dr. Sun most often wrote were the two characters [universal love], [universal love is called benevolence]. Therefore, Dr. Sun often happily wrote them. From this, we can understand that Dr. Sun's daily behavior towards others and himself, governing the country and bringing peace to the world, was all based on benevolence and love. Everyone knows that Dr. Sun had superior intelligence, but it was only used to know benevolence. Everyone knows that Dr. Sun had superior courage. He fought against all counter-revolutionaries to the end, day after day for decades. No one's courage could surpass Dr. Sun, but Dr. Sun's superior courage was only used to practice benevolence, only used to deal with counter-revolutionary people, that is, to practice the Principle of Benevolence and Love, not hesitating to sacrifice himself and not caring about anything else. Therefore, each and every one of our comrades must know that Dr. Sun's entire revolutionary personality and entire life were rooted in benevolence and love, and achieved his nobility, greatness, and benevolence and love. Fellow comrades, you must also know what we are revolutionizing for. In one sentence, revolution is to practice benevolence and love in the world. Other than this, there is no revolution to speak of, because revolution is to save the country and save the people, to make the unequal world a world of equality, the greatest cause of benevolence and love. Therefore, revolution is definitely not about fighting for power and profit, killing and arson. Only those with a great thought of benevolence and love rooted in the greatest revolutionary personality of benevolence and love can truly revolutionize.</p>
<p>The above has already explained the system of the philosophy of people's livelihood and what it contains, analyzed to everyone. As for the original table, I cannot fully explain it to everyone because of lack of time, and can only speak of a few important words, that is, the central meaning of the table.</p>
<p>The table's explanation of the heart says, [The three paths that can be achieved in the world are: the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood. The three things used to practice them are: wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three virtues that can be achieved in the world. The one thing used to practice them is one. What is one? Sincerity. Sincerity is choosing what is good and holding on to it.] This paragraph says that there are only three paths that can be achieved in the world: the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood. All problems in human society can be summarized in these three items. The academics and culture of the past and present are all to solve these three problems. Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People are the crystallization of all academic thoughts of the past and present, Chinese and foreign, and are the most appropriate method to solve the problems of human society. How can the Three Principles of the People of Dr. Sun, that is, the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood, be practiced? This is what each of us, especially every revolutionary party member, must have three kinds of virtues that can be achieved. The so-called three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, must have these three virtues in order to practice the three paths of the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood. Therefore, it is said [wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three virtues that can be achieved in the world]. These three virtues are what every modern citizen should have, and are also inherent in our nation. If someone asks us what the basic virtues inherent in our nation are, we can answer him: the virtues inherent in the Chinese nation are wisdom, benevolence, and courage, or it can be said that they are the [loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace] that Dr. Sun spoke of. A person who does not have these virtues is not worthy to be a modern citizen, and even more unworthy to be a revolutionary party member. How can one have the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage? For example, it can be said that we have the courage to randomly hit and kill people. This is indeed a kind of courage, but it is not the true [courage] of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, because although it is courage, it is not benevolent and not wise. True courage must be the [courage] of wisdom and benevolence, that is, to sacrifice everything for saving the country and saving the people and to do the most effective struggle. Similarly, [benevolence] must also be the [benevolence] of wisdom and courage, not the lukewarm [benevolence], [the narrow-minded righteousness], and even more not false benevolence and false righteousness. [Wisdom] must be the wisdom [of benevolence and courage]. Therefore, [seeing righteousness and not doing it], [knowing but not being benevolent], or not using one's own intelligence and talent for [practicing benevolence], or even using it for [unbenevolence] or [falsification] those kinds of intelligence are all false, and even harm human society. Therefore, the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage are what everyone should have at the same time, and none can be lacking. Only in this way can they be consistent and complete the revolutionary personality. How can a person enrich the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage and complete the perfect revolutionary personality? This is to have a basic premise and spiritual motive force, that is, so-called [sincerity]. Sincerity is to do everything sincerely and honestly, with one heart and one virtue, and not to have a little bit of hypocrisy in all actions. The most benevolent will should not have a little bit of shaking from beginning to end. Whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, all those with great wisdom and great courage who can establish great achievements and great undertakings all do this. Being able to be sincere will make everything successful. Not being sincere will make it impossible to do anything well. Therefore, it is said [sincerity is achievement], [sincerity is the end and the beginning of things, without sincerity there is nothing]. If we want to take the three paths of the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood, we must have the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage.</p>
<p>Virtue, if we want to have these three virtues and fill them with energy to achieve great achievements and establish great undertakings, we must first be able to be [sincere]. Sincerity is [one], one heart and one virtue, consistent from beginning to end. Therefore, it is said [wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three virtues that can be achieved in the world, so the one thing used to practice them is one, what is one? Sincerity].</p>
<p>Finally, we must talk about how to be sincere and how to be consistent from beginning to end. This is to [choose what is good and hold on to it], that is, to select a best principle or thing, firmly grasp it, be able to abide by it from beginning to end, and strive to practice it, unless this most benevolent principle is discovered, and the most benevolent thing is done without stopping. If it is not done, then sacrifice to this. Now that we want to revolutionize, the first priority is to choose a best doctrine and adhere to it, believe in it, and practice it sincerely and honestly throughout our lives, sacrificing everything and carrying it through from beginning to end. We must encourage and spur ourselves at all times, and we must be vigilant at all times, otherwise we will not be able to speak of revolution, and there will be no hope of success. For example, there are many doctrines now, there are the Three Principles of the People, Communism, Anarchism, and other various doctrines. If we do not choose what is good and hold on to it, today we hear that the Three Principles of the People are good, so we believe in the Three Principles of the People, tomorrow we hear that Communism is good, so we believe in Communism, and the day after tomorrow, we hear that Anarchism is good, so we go to believe in Anarchism. How can there still be hope of success? Is this still a revolutionary person? Therefore, if we want to be a revolutionary person, we must first choose a best doctrine and sincerely and honestly believe in it and practice it, and never change from beginning to end. Now, the revolutionary doctrine to save the country, save the people, and save the world in the end is Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People. If we want our revolution to succeed, we can only sincerely and honestly believe in the Three Principles of the People, and practice them with one heart and one virtue, without allowing a little bit of doubt about the Three Principles of the People, a little bit of criticism, and only do what Dr. Sun said honestly, absolutely not saying that we believe in the Three Principles of the People today and then do not believe in them or change our minds, and also speak of the Three Principles of the People but do not act on them. We must think, speak, and act, and never change until death. Only in this way can we be considered true followers of Dr. Sun, worthy of being a revolutionary party member, and can we practice the Three Principles of the People and complete the Chinese Revolution. We are now followers of the Three Principles of the People. We hold Dr. Sun Memorial Week every week, and today we come to commemorate Dr. Sun's death every year. We must have a deep and accurate understanding of the source of Dr. Sun's doctrines and the location of his basic thoughts, as well as Dr. Sun's great revolutionary personality, in order to strengthen our confidence in the Three Principles of the People and encourage our revolutionary personality cultivation. Therefore, today, when commemorating Dr. Sun's death, I especially explain to all comrades Dr. Sun's philosophy of people's livelihood and his noble and great revolutionary personality, hoping that everyone will pay attention to studying and understanding them from now on, and from now on practice them, and sincerely and honestly become true followers of Dr. Sun, practicing Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People.] (End)</p>
<h3>Alarming Figures of Shandong's Economic Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>| Money Flowing Abroad Reaches 400 Million Annually |</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Under the dumping power of foreign goods, Shandong's money flows abroad annually, reaching 400 million yuan. On average, each person in the province bears more than ten yuan. The Shandong authorities are now actively planning relief efforts, hoping to reverse the misfortune. Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, is also drafting a concrete plan to implement it step by step. Tonight (16th), Zhang Honglie was invited to give a lecture at Shandong Qilu University. The topic was [The Causes and Remedies of Shandong's Economic Bankruptcy], which is quite important. The main points are described below.</p>
<h3>Causes of Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>The first major cause of Shandong's economic bankruptcy is the dumping of foreign goods. It is estimated that cloth and textiles alone reach 200 million yuan annually. Cigarettes are 30 million yuan annually. Kerosene, gasoline, etc., in Jinan City alone are over 1 million yuan annually. Calculating by Shandong's population of 40 million, the whole province bears about 100 million yuan annually. Chemical industrial raw materials, etc., total 50 million yuan annually. All other foreign goods total 50 million yuan annually. In total, foreign goods dumped in Shandong exceed 400 million yuan annually. Calculating by Shandong's population, each person bears more than ten yuan annually. The second major cause is the reduction of income. Shandong's silk, previously exported, from coastal areas such as Yantai and Longkou, reached about 30 million yuan annually, (over 20 million taels were transported and sold to other places for export, totaling over 50 million annually. Now it has completely stagnated. Shandong's peanut kernels and oil, previously exported, were at least over 30 million annually. Now there is no market for many days, and they are piled up unsold. In addition, Shandong people in the three northeastern provinces remitted over 30 million yuan annually. Now, due to the loss of the Northeast, remittances have invisibly stopped, and some people have returned from the Northeast, consuming about 20 million yuan annually. This direct and indirect loss is over 50 million yuan. Shandong's annual income should be about 120 million yuan. Calculating with the dumping of foreign goods, the annual import surplus has reached as much as 270 million yuan. Now, the usual income of 130 million yuan has vanished. In addition, rural areas are bankrupt, grains are piled up, and sales are stagnant. The tobacco industry along the Jiaoji Railway has also seen sales stagnation. On the other hand, the national taxes and local taxes that should be borne remain the same. Resistance to the dumping of essential foreign goods is made with native products with extremely low value that cannot be sold, causing money to flow abroad, reaching 400 million yuan. How can Shandong's economy not be bankrupt?</p>
<h3>Relief Methods</h3>
<p>Our province is currently working hard to provide relief from economic bankruptcy and has decided on a concrete plan to be implemented gradually. According to estimates, Shandong produces about 2.4 million dan of cotton annually, while China's national cotton needs are about 10 million dan. However, national cotton production is only 6 million dan, leaving a shortfall of 4 million dan, which is supplied by foreign countries. If the government can use appropriate methods for improving cotton seeds, organizing cooperatives, and enabling direct transactions between producers and factories, increasing cotton production to 10 million dan to meet the needs of national yarn mills, it can recover losses. Furthermore, Shandong's coal exports and shipments to Shanghai and other places via the Jinpu Railway amount to about 2 million tons annually. If a unified policy is adopted, coal mines are improved, and coal is graded to increase exports by onefold, an increase of 1 million tons would generate at least 10 million yuan in additional income. Regarding textiles, efforts should be made to weave, dye, and print good quality yarn from Jinan's yarn mills and distribute it to rural villages in various counties and along the Jiaoji Railway to resist the dumping of foreign cloth. If half of the foreign cloth can be resisted, 10 million yuan in losses can be recovered. In addition, the tobacco industry should fundamentally improve tobacco cultivation and curing. The government should establish a large tobacco factory in Jinan, using local Shandong tobacco to produce cigarettes, and use political power to promote sales in various counties. Even if foreign cigarettes cannot be completely resisted, if one-third of them can be replaced, 10 million yuan in losses can be recovered. In addition, efforts should be made to improve old industries, organize new industries, and develop resources. It is expected that in a few years, not only will the economic situation of rural areas be relieved, but also the industrial and commercial sectors can gradually develop. (16th)</p>
<h3>Bandit Liu Invades Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Harassing 46 Counties After Entering Henan for Two Months</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: Liu Guitang's bandit troops crossed the Pinghan Railway eastward on the 12th, wreaking havoc in Xihua, Taikang, Yanling, Weishi, and other counties. Bianyuan (Kaifeng) was also reported to be under heavy strain. After being severely suppressed by the troops of Tan Zixin and others, the bandits fled to Liulin, about 25 li west of Huaiyang, on the 14th. Yesterday, they passed through Renxingji, Wutaiji, and Hutougang in Luyi County. Today, they have entered the border of Anhui Province. It has been 65 days since Liu's bandit troops invaded Henan Province on January 10th. Initially, they harassed Wu'an, Shexian, Neihuang, Anyang, Linxian, Tangyin, Huixian, Jixian, Xiuwu, Bo'ai, Wuzhi, Jiyuan, Qinyang, Mengxian, and Wenxian in northern Henan. Then, on January 12th, they crossed the Yellow River stealthily, and Gongxian, Yanshi, Luoyang, Mengjin, Xin'an, Mianchi, Shanzhou, Lingbao, Lushi, Luoning, Songxian, Yiyang, Lushan, Nanzhao, Nanyang, Fangcheng, Yexian, Wuyang, Xiangxian, Jiaxian, Yuxian, Lin颍, Xuchang, Changge, Xihua, Yanling, Fugou, Weishi, Taikang, Huaiyang, and Luyi were all afflicted by them. There are currently no statistics for the direct and indirect losses of these 46 counties. Although they have been severely suppressed by the troops of He Zhuguo, Chang Jingwu, Bai Fengxiang, and others; the troops of Shang Zhen, Guo Xipeng, Huang Guanghua, and others; and the troops of Gao Guizi, Chen Keping, Tang Junde, Zhang ZhanKui, Xue Weiying, Zhang Fang, Pang Bingxun, and Tan Zixin, Liu's bandits have been in Henan for a long time during the 18th and 19th years of the Republic, and are familiar with the terrain. They also have considerable connections with local bandits, and ultimately they could not be completely annihilated. Now that they have fled into Anhui Province, if they are not annihilated, the future consequences are still worrisome. (March 16th)</p>

<h3>Summary of Murder and Robbery Cases</h3>
<p>On the night of the 16th of this month, at the home of Zhong Shoufeng, a friend of the owner in Zhongjiadai, Salt Three Map area within the Second District, more than ten robbers suddenly arrived, speaking with a Punan accent. Each wielded knives, guns, and凶器, and their faces were painted. They broke down the door, bound the homeowner, and searched and robbed wantonly, taking clothes and jewelry worth about one or two hundred yuan. They took the loot and fled southwest. Last night (17th), in the Xiyandou area, 43rd Bao, 6th Map of Xiaokunshan, 9th District, the homes of farmers Lu Zilai and Lu Shaoshan were also attacked at about 9 o'clock by more than twenty robbers speaking with a Hakka accent. They destroyed the gate and entered, holding pistols and flashlights, robbing for two hours. At the same time, they injured Lu Shaoshan's wife, Zhang, in the foot, and the hired worker Lu Wenfa was also beaten and injured in the head before escaping. That night, the robbers also went to the home of Zhang Wenlai in Shijiafang, 9th Map, where a wedding was being held. They were attracted by the sight and entered to rob, taking two legs of cured meat, three cotton quilts, and clothing, among other things. In addition to the losses, Wenlai's son, Xilinpu, twelve years old, was tragically shot and killed. Lu and others came to Songjiang that night to report to the land and water public security authorities. Police Chief Zhou Ding immediately dispatched inspectors and detectives to investigate and pursue, but it was too late. He has ordered all subordinate bureaus and offices to pay close attention to the investigation and arrest, so as to solve the case.</p>

<h3>County Order Approves Reduction of Surtaxes</h3>
<p>The Provincial Department of Finance previously ordered this county to discuss reducing surtaxes. The county government convened a county-wide budget meeting to discuss the matter. Everyone believed that the surtaxes collected in this county were all earmarked for specific undertakings, and there was really nothing to reduce. A resolution was passed accordingly. Now, the Provincial Department of Finance has again ordered a substantial reduction. Therefore, the matter was submitted to the 30th District Chief meeting convened yesterday. It was resolved that the various surtaxes collected in this county, which are designated for the expenses of existing undertakings, are extremely stretched and are truly difficult to reduce further. For the sake of both the people's livelihood and undertakings, the only option is to change the remaining land survey fee of one jiao per mu to five fen per year, extending it for one year. In addition, the road construction mu donation is reduced by one fen, changing it to four fen (two fen for the province and two fen for the county). It will be implemented after being reported to the Department of Finance for approval.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Murder Case Occurs in Hengjing District</h3>
<p>Xu Shuiquan, a fisherman from Fengji Village in Hengjing District, had a wife, Zhu, 30 years old, who was slightly attractive and coveted by a local rogue. On the night of the 9th of this month, Xu Jingzhou went to Taihu Lake to fish, and only Zhu was at home. Suddenly, a neighbor, Zhang Heshang, gathered several people to guard the front and back doors of Xu's house, claiming to be searching for Zhu's lover. They left at dawn without finding anything.</p>
<p>On the 11th, Xu Shuiquan returned home and, after learning the details, considered it a great insult and vowed revenge. He then negotiated with Zhang on the 16th. The two sides clashed and were soon dispersed by someone's persuasion. However, that night, Zhang gathered several people again to cause trouble at Xu's house. Xu fled immediately. On the 17th, Zhang suddenly died at home. His family reported to the police station, alleging that he was fatally injured by Xu twisting his testicles. Xu Huilong and Wu Zhangshi were witnesses. The police station arrested Xu and interrogated and detained him at the District Procuratorate yesterday (18th). Since Xu denied twisting Zhang's testicles, the District Procuratorate scheduled to send personnel to the village to examine the body today (19th) before further verification.</p>

Zhu Liugen, the local constable, who was responsible for looking after the trees along the Sujia Road under the order of the county government, also shouted to catch the thieves and stepped forward to investigate. Seeing Zhu rushing over, the three robbers hid on the ground. When he approached, they suddenly got up and fired, hitting him in a vital spot. The bullet went through his chest and out his back. Zhu died instantly. Villagers heard the sound and chased after the robbers, who had already fled far away.</p>

Unexpectedly, on the night of the 15th of this month, Xiaoyu's home was again visited by sea bandits. He was awakened from his dream and immediately woke his family, got up, and escaped through the back door, hiding in the fields and bamboo forests. From a distance, they saw about eight or nine robbers, all dressed in black, with weapons of varying lengths, and carrying a lot of hemp rope around their waists. The robbers then entered for an hour or so, and seeing no sign of anyone, they left empty-handed. The Yangs were afraid of being tricked by the bandits and still dared not return immediately. They returned home at dawn to check, and nothing was lost. Even the trunks and chests were intact. Everyone said that the bandits were not there to rob things, but to avenge the old grudges from two years ago. The Yangs have now temporarily moved elsewhere.</p>

On the 16th, Wenyan Town in the 1st District was also inspecting draftees, and the town hall was destroyed by the townspeople gathering together. The district commander went to the township and was beaten and injured while training the soldiers from house to house.

There were also those riding bicycles or rickshaws, and those walking, all connecting with each other, quite crowded. The Public Security Bureau had dispatched police officers to direct traffic along the way in advance, and the order was better than during the naming of the five airplanes.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Venue</h3>
<p>At the entrance of the venue, there was a flat-topped archway made of cypress branches, with the Party and National flags forked on the left and right. Soldiers from the Security Department guarded the archway with guns. Inspectors from the Public Security Bureau collected admission tickets. On the east side of the venue, a rostrum was set up, with a white cloth banner in the center that read [Tianchu Airplane Naming Ceremony]. On both sides were white cloth couplets that read [Tianchu Airplane, Indirectly Funded by Patriots Who Love Ajinomoto] and [Aviation Saves the Nation, May the People Work Together and Rise Up Quickly]. A portrait of the Premier and the Party and National flags were hung on the stage. The municipal military band was to the right of the stage, about ten feet away, surrounded by ropes to prevent the audience from entering. Police officers from the Public Security Bureau's police brigade, soldiers from the Security Department, and soldiers stationed at the airport maintained order.</p>

<h3>Mr. Wu's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremony was performed according to etiquette, Wu YunChu of the Tianchu Factory reported on the purchase of the airplane, saying briefly: "Fellow compatriots, our factory has donated an airplane with its own funds in the midst of the call to save the country through aviation. Today, we are holding the naming ceremony. I am extremely honored to have everyone participate in the ceremony. Since [January 28th], Shanghai has been arbitrarily bombed by Japanese bandits, and the Zhabei area has been almost completely devastated. Because I believe that to avenge this humiliation, we must develop aviation. I have traveled to Europe and the United States to inspect aviation. The airplane factories in those countries ridiculed our country for only having nominal inspections and not having plans to purchase airplanes to develop aviation. At that time, the war in the Northeast was urgent, and the Shanghai Aviation Association was established in response to the needs of the people. In addition to joining as a member, our factory also agreed to purchase a fighter airplane and donate it to the government. Unexpectedly, during the test flight landing, the nose of the airplane was damaged. Fortunately, the factory director helped to negotiate, and as a result, in addition to repairing the original airplane, a trainer airplane was also given as compensation. As for this test flight, in addition to hiring a German pilot from the airline to test fly, I also invited Captain Gao Zhihang to test fly once. According to him, the results were quite good. The above is the process of donating the airplane."</p>
<h3>Mr. Du's Report</h3>
<p>After Mr. Wu's report, Du Yuesheng then reported, saying briefly: "Today is the naming ceremony for the Tianchu Fighter Airplane and the ceremony for my donation of a trainer airplane to Comrade Sun Tonggang. Mr. Wu has just reported on the process of purchasing the airplane, which is very detailed. It is quite commendable that the Tianchu Factory can purchase and donate an airplane with its own funds. If all industries can donate and purchase airplanes, then developing our country's aviation will not be difficult. In order to encourage talent in piloting, I have purchased an airplane with my own funds and donated it to Comrade Sun Tonggang and the Flying Club. Although our country has airplanes, if there is no piloting talent, it is useless. However, I still have two hopes that I must explain: (1) Regarding the Yuehui airplane donated to Comrade Sun, I hope that Comrade Sun will work hard in research to seek further study. (2) Regarding the Yuewen airplane donated to the Flying Club, I hope that it will work hard to train piloting talent for the future development of aviation construction."</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, Chu Minyi, representative of the Central Government and the Executive Yuan, gave a speech, saying briefly: "Since Europe and the United States invented airplanes, the flight of airplanes has been faster than anything else, enough to jointly research and promote. Later, airplanes were used in war to destroy the enemy's construction. Since our compatriots have suffered great losses, they all believe that airplanes can save the country from disaster. Therefore, there have been several times when airplanes have been donated by the people, which shows the patriotism of our compatriots. This time, the Tianchu Factory has donated to the government, and Mr. Du Yuesheng has purchased and donated to Comrade Sun Tonggang and the Flying Club, which is extremely admirable for their grand intention to promote aviation. Comrade Sun is the first Chinese pilot to fly back to the motherland from Europe, opening a new memorial for long-distance flight across the country. In the future, he will definitely make better contributions to the country. The Flying Club is organized to train piloting talent. In the future, I hope that compatriots will continue to work hard to promote it." After the speech, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, representative of the National Government, gave a speech, saying briefly: "Fellow compatriots, comrades, I represent the National Government in participating in the naming ceremony of the Tianchu Fighter Airplane. Today's naming is divided into two types: (1) The Tianchu Factory donated to the government. (2) Mr. Du Yuesheng donated to Comrade Sun Tonggang and the Flying Club. Regarding the above two points, I thought of something that is quite appropriate. During the Spring and Autumn period, the State of Chen was invaded by the State of Jin. The merchants of the State of Chen tried to purchase defensive items to defend themselves. Seeing that the merchants of the State of Chen had such a united spirit, the State of Jin knew that it was difficult to invade and stopped the war. Today, the Tianchu Factory can purchase a fighter airplane and donate it to the government, which shows its love and protection of the government. If our compatriots can all be like this, then the future is quite hopeful. Also, Mr. Du Yuesheng purchased and donated to Comrade Sun Tonggang with his own funds, the significance of which is not only to promote the aviation industry, but also to encourage piloting talent, which is extremely commendable. We hope that the country will be rich and strong. Only by promoting industry can we become rich. Only when we are rich can we talk about building national defense and cultivating self-defense capabilities, so that the country can be strong." Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration, then gave a speech on behalf of Shen Dexie, saying briefly: "Director Xu of the Aviation Administration Tianchu airplane (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>is unable to come to Shanghai to participate due to other matters, so he sent me to come. The Tianchu Factory purchased and donated the airplane, and I represent the Aviation Administration in thanking them." Lin Wojiang then gave a speech on behalf of the airline (briefly). Finally, Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce gave a speech, saying briefly: "This naming ceremony is different from the previous ones, because the previous ones were aided by groups, but today's is donated by a company and an individual. The meaning of today's naming of the Tianchu Zheng and Deputy airplanes is to save the country every day. The meaning of the Yuehui and Yuewen airplanes donated by Mr. Du is to promote aviation every month."</p>
<h3>Airplane Presentation Ceremony</h3>
<p>After the speeches, the airplane presentation ceremony began. Amidst the melodious sounds of military music, Mr. Wu Yunchu, owner of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, first reverently presented the Tianchu-branded fighter plane certificate of delivery with both hands. Xu Peigen, specially appointed by the National Government Aviation Department, accepted it on behalf of Shen Dexie. They bowed to each other. Mr. Wu then presented the Tianchu Deputy-branded trainer plane certificate of delivery, which Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, accepted on behalf of the Shanghai Flying Club. Following that, Du Yuesheng presented the Yuehui-branded certificate to Sun Tonggang, a Chinese young aviator, and the Yuewen-branded certificate to the Shanghai Flying Club, also accepted by Lin Wojiang on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Naming and Ascent into the Sky</h3>
<p>After the presentation ceremony, it was 3:05 PM. Led by the Public Security Bureau military band, the presidium and their wives proceeded in an orderly fashion to the Tianchu-branded planes. Mayor Wu, Wu Yunchu, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin removed the Party and State flags covering the wings of the Tianchu-branded, Tianchu Deputy-branded, Yuehui-branded, and Yuewen-branded planes respectively. Then, the four wives of Wu, Wu, Du, and Zhang each held a red silk-wrapped Shaoxing wine bottle and gently tossed it towards the nose of the plane. Wine splashed everywhere, and military music and applause erupted simultaneously, creating quite a lively scene. After the bottle-breaking ceremony, the crowd stepped back. Sun Tonggang then piloted the Yuehui-branded plane, and Gao Zhihang, captain of the Aviation School's fighter squadron, piloted the Tianchu-branded plane, circling and ascending into the sky.</p>
<h3>Demonstration of Skills</h3>
<p>After Sun Tonggang piloted the Yuehui-branded plane into the sky, he circled once and then landed. As it was Sun's first time piloting the Yuehui-branded plane, no extensive performance was given for safety. At 3:50 PM, Gao Zhihang piloted the Tianchu-branded plane, ascended from the ground, and performed maneuvers such as left and right rolls, front and back flips, and steep dives from high altitude. The audience was astonished, gasping and exclaiming in awe. After about ten minutes, he landed safely. At 4:05 PM, pilots Hao Penghan, Liu Cuigang, Zhang Xufu, Hu Guanghui, Zhou Tingfang, and Zhou Hanxun piloted the Shanghai Merchant-branded, Shanghai Worker-branded, Shanghai School-branded, Shanghai Boy Scout-branded, Zhejiang National Salvation-branded, and Whampoa First-branded planes respectively, taking off in succession and performing formations such as horizontal lines, vertical lines, and echelon formations. At 4:20 PM, Captain Gao Zhihang, accompanied by Deputy Wang Tianxiang, each piloted the Shanghai City-branded and Ningbo-branded planes into the sky, performing various combat techniques with skilled piloting, which was quite spectacular. The entire audience applauded and cheered. At 4:40 PM, the planes began to land one after another.</p>
<h3>National Government Commendation</h3>
<p>The National Government, to commend the Tianchu Factory, issued Commendation Certificate No. 15, which read: "Whereas the factory has raised funds to purchase the Tianchu-branded airplane, which benefits air defense, its patriotic zeal is truly commendable. A special commendation is hereby granted to inspire and encourage. This certificate bears the signature of Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, and Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, etc."</p>
<h3>Airplane Delivery Certificates</h3>
<p>(1) Tianchu-branded: "It is hereby acknowledged that the nation has the right to defend, and the people have the duty to contribute. Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, a member of this association, has independently purchased the Tianchu-branded fighter plane and contributed it to the government for defending against aggression and protecting the people, each fulfilling its responsibility. This is truly a blessing for the Party and the nation. This certificate is issued by the Chinese Aviation Association, March 18, 1934." (2) Tianchu Deputy-branded: "It is hereby acknowledged that aviation for national salvation places equal importance on machinery and talent. This factory hereby presents the Tianchu Deputy-branded trainer plane purchased by this factory to the Flying Club for aviation education, cultivating talents, and protecting the Party and the nation. This certificate is issued by Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, March 18, 1934." The Yuehui-branded and Yuewen-branded certificates are generally the same and will not be repeated here.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association issued a circular telegram yesterday, which read: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Military Commission, various ministries and commissions, the Hangzhou Aviation Department, Party Headquarters of various provinces and cities, governments of various provinces and cities, various armies, divisions, brigades, regiments, various legal entities, various newspapers, overseas Party Headquarters, and compatriots from all walks of life: For the sake of wiping out national humiliation and striving for strength, the Air Force is our reliance. This association has strived to advocate and has raised aviation funds to save the country, ordered fighter planes, and successively named them Shanghai City First-branded and Shanghai Merchant-branded, Shanghai Worker-branded, Shanghai School-branded, Shanghai Boy Scout-branded, Ningbo-branded, and Two-Roads-branded, a total of seven fighter planes, which were presented to the government last autumn, hoping for your gracious review. Now, on the eleventh day of this month, at the Hongqiao Airfield, the Tianchu Deputy-branded and Yuewen-branded planes are being used to establish a flying club. All our countrymen, upon hearing of this grand event, should know that the elites of Shanghai have based their patriotic zeal on their determination and turned it into a great act of saving the country, which is truly admirable. However, the flight of a wren cannot be compared to the back of a swan. To strengthen the Air Force, we must exhaust the nation's financial resources and contribute as much as possible so that the heavens can be solidified and the enemy can be repelled. Each of you should be inspired by the news, aspire to the skies, save the weak, strive for survival, and it is deeply relied upon. With the telegram hastily sent, we eagerly await your response. The Chinese Aviation Association bows in respect, eleventh."</p>

<h3>Formation Flight to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Ningbo- Zhejiang Government and other six planes successively ascended, flew in formation, and then returned to Hangzhou. After Gao Zhihang piloted the Tianchu-branded plane to land, students from the Aviation School piloted the Tianchu Deputy-branded plane to ascend. Gao then piloted the Shanghai City First-branded plane to perform. Around 5 PM, the plane sent by the Aviation Department and the Tianchu Main-branded plane flew back to Hangzhou to rejoin their units. The spectators also began to return home.</p>
<h3>Flying Club Preparatory Office Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>=Promoting public interest in aviation=</p>
<p>=Creating aviation personnel using simple methods=</p>
<p>=Aiming to popularize aviation knowledge in society=</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Aviators Sun Tonggang, Mao Bangchu, Nie Kaiyi, and others, in order to advocate for the development of aviation among the public, initiated the organization of the Shanghai Flying Club. The preparatory work has been underway for several months. As the registration procedures have not yet been completed, a preparatory office has been established first at No. 9, Lane 177, Luban Road (inside the Aviation Association). Once the procedures are completed, the official establishment will be announced. The origin and development of the club will be recorded below:</p>
<h3>Building Aviation as an Exit for National Salvation</h3>
<p>During the [January 28th Incident], the Chinese people were heartbroken by the enemy's use of air power to ravage our country and kill our compatriots, and resolved to seek a solution ourselves. They realized that the enemy's daring to invade our airspace as if entering an uninhabited territory was solely due to the weakness of our air force and its inability to engage in combat. Therefore, patriots used the saying "[Without aviation, there is no national defense]" to remind each other, and Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament of aviation for national salvation was almost universally known. The entire nation recognized that building aviation was the only way out for national salvation. However, building aviation involves countless aspects, such as raising funds to purchase airplanes, manufacturing airplanes, training personnel, and engaging in ground equipment, which cannot be achieved in a single day, nor can the government alone bear the burden. Therefore, it is necessary for the government and the people to work together with concerted efforts. The establishment of the Chinese Aviation Association is precisely to meet this demand and to provide a center for cooperation between the government and the people.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Airplanes and Donating Them to the Government</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association was established on New Year's Day last year, and immediately began promotional activities, deciding to hold Aviation National Salvation Week from January 23rd to January 28th. All sectors of the country responded enthusiastically, especially Shanghai. Subsequently, the Standing Council formulated guidelines for the Aviation Association to proceed in stages. It was decided to first raise funds in Shanghai to purchase airplanes and donate them to the government, and then take a step further to establish training flight institutions to train pilots. With surplus funds, they would promote the establishment of an airplane manufacturing factory. The two items of raising funds to purchase airplanes and training personnel were the most important to the association at the beginning. Since fundraising began in March last year, with Mayor Wu of Shanghai publicly elected as the head of the fundraising team, millions of funds were collected in a few months under Mayor Wu's leadership, breaking all previous records. The association then consulted the Central Government and the Aviation Department to examine the needs of national defense, select the types of airplanes, and request assistance in ordering them. This is why the association purchased eighteen fighter planes and donated them to the government between last autumn and summer.</p>
<h3>All Parties Pay Attention to Training Personnel</h3>
<p>As for the plan to train personnel, the Standing Council also decided to begin preparations and appointed Secretary-General Lin Wojiang to draft the design for the Flying Club. After the principles were approved by the Standing Council, Mr. Lin Wojiang was sent to Hangzhou to contact the Director of the Aviation Department to borrow the Aviation Department's Shanghai airfield for the Flying Club's training flights and to borrow several trainer planes from the Aviation School. The authorities agreed to the loans. However, because the amount of money the Association had designated to purchase airplanes exceeded the funds raised, there were no remaining funds to cover the Flying Club's operating expenses, and it had to be put on hold temporarily. But in recent months, all parties have paid close attention to the Association's plan to train personnel, sending letters inquiring about the progress of the Flying Club's organization. Some were patriotic youths who wished to dedicate themselves to the aviation industry to serve the country and sought to join the club to practice flying, while others were social leaders concerned about training aviation personnel, such as Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Wu Yunchu in this city, who were willing to donate trainer planes to the Flying Club to promote its success. Others were willing to sponsor operating and recurring costs when the Flying Club could be expected to be established.</p>
<h3>Aviation Industry Veterans Express Appreciation</h3>
<p>As for the veterans of the aviation industry, such as Central Committee members Chen Qingyun and Zhang Huichang, who had heard of the Association's preparation of the Flying Club, they all expressed deep appreciation. Although Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Authority, and Mao Bangchu, Deputy Principal, were focused on military aviation, they were very sympathetic to the creation of civil flight training and regarded it as an endeavor beneficial to the development of aviation in our country. Recently, Mr. Sun Tonggang, a young Chinese aviator, returned home from a long-distance flight from Germany, and upon learning of the near-term preparations of the Association's Flying Club after completing a national flight, he strongly urged its early establishment and promised to sacrifice his valuable time and energy to promote it, and even took on the role of trainer. At this point, the Association's members believed that since they had received support from all parties, even though the funds had not yet been fully raised, if they did not seize the opportunity to actively prepare to promote its success, when would they? This is a general overview of the preparatory process of the Flying Club and the reason for this announcement of the establishment of the preparatory office.</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang and Others Initiate Organization</h3>
<p>The initiators of the Shanghai Flying Club are all well-known figures in the aviation industry of our country. The names are as follows: Sun Tonggang, Chen Qingyun, Zeng Yijing, Nie Kaiyi, Mao Bangchu, Huang Bingheng, Yao Xijiu, Shen Dexie, Li Jingzong, Chen Wenlin, Qian Changzuo, Lin Wojiang.</p>
<h3>Lin Wojiang Discusses the Necessity of Creation</h3>
<p>According to the Secretary-General of the Association, Lin Wojiang, the meaning of the Flying Club and the necessity of its creation was explained to the New News Agency reporter as follows: "The Flying Club is a flying club, and its purpose is to promote and make the public interested in aviation, and to create aviation personnel in a relatively economical and simple way in practical aspects. The reason for naming it the Flying Club, rather than the original Western term (FlyingClub) flying club, is to avoid misunderstandings among the public, thinking that this top organization is the same as an ordinary club in nature, and its main purpose is to pass the time and entertain. In fact, this kind of creation has a profound meaning. On the one hand, it is to implement the training of flight technology and reserve aircraft drivers for the country. On the other hand, because it is a civil organization without military relations, it can be made public so that the public can visit at any time, in order to promote aviation knowledge in society. Today, in discussing aviation for national salvation, it is necessary to first have a general understanding of aviation, which is what Westerners call [aviation brain]. This kind of organization is very common in European and American powers, and it has been extended to their colonies. The United Kingdom is the most characteristic among them. (There are 52 flying clubs.) In India (six places have been established), Singapore, and Hong Kong, many flying clubs have been established in recent years. Our country is so large and has been running aviation for more than 20 years, but we have not yet seen the establishment of a flying club. It is even worse than the colonies of the great powers. Shanghai, which has 3 million citizens and leads the country, should take advantage of this time to support the early realization of the Shanghai Flying Club. The purpose of our association's establishment is to advocate for the development of aviation among the public, so in addition to raising funds and publicity, we should take a step further to carry out practical work. Running schools and factories are important tasks, and the creation of a flying club should be carried out first, because it is relatively easy to get started and has quick results, so as to attract the attention of the public. In the future, the fundraising will also be more willing to donate because the public has a strong interest in aviation. We can see from the budget of the Japanese Empire Flying Association in Showa 7 (1932), which used 96,000 gold yuan for actually promoting civil aviation and publicity, that the reason why Japanese people recently donated more than 100 [Patriotic Number] airplanes is because the Association was able to actually promote it on weekdays and achieve good results."</p>
<h3>The People's Revolutionary Memorial Conference in Peiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Tao Baichuan Reports on Progress</p>
<p>The Chinese Concession Authorities are on Strict Alert</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Peiping People's Revolution Memorial Day. The city's Party Department specially convened representatives from all walks of life in the city to hold a memorial meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The meeting was chaired by Tao Baichuan, a member of the committee. The Chinese concession police authorities implemented security measures to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause disturbances. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>
<p>Tao Baichuan of the City Party Department, Zhu Yagui of the Labor Education Association, Mao Yun of the Second District Citizen's Federation, Feng Sizui of Jinan University, Lu Yuxing of the Fourth District Silk Weavers' Union, Tan Bairong of the Silk Fabric Dyeing Industry Union, as well as the representatives of the Qinglin Fabric Dyeing Guild, the Garment Guild, the First District Carpentry Guild, and various organizations, groups, schools, and Party branches, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<h3>Conference Staff</h3>
<p>Chairman Tao Baichuan, Recorder Du Mengsen, Master of Ceremonies Zhang Hanyun, Receptionists Huang E, Tong Muge, Lin Kecong, Wang Guoping, Cao Runchen, etc. The Xiaomuqiao Police Station of the Second District sent police to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremonial rites, Chairman Tao Baichuan gave a report, which stated that today is the anniversary of the March 18th Massacre. At that time, the National Army and the Feng Army were at war in Peiping. The Peiping garrison National Army, fearing that the Feng Army would attack by waterway, laid mines at Dagu Port, prohibiting ships from passing. At that time, Japan was the first to object, and various countries protested. Japanese warships therefore clashed with the National Army. Later, the powers invoked the Boxer Protocol as a pretext to issue an ultimatum, and the Beijing government was about to succumb. Therefore, the people of Peiping held a citizens' congress outside Tiananmen on the 18th to petition, which led to a conflict with Duan Qirui's guards, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Therefore, brothers have a few thoughts (1) The March 18th Massacre was facilitated by imperialism, especially by Japanese imperialism, which always acted as a pioneer of aggression. Therefore, Japan and China have an irreconcilable feud. (2) The powers have repeatedly used the pretext of treaties to prevent our country's legitimate defense. The occurrence of the March 18th Massacre was also due to this. The inability to actively transport troops to aid during the defense of the Great Wall was also because the Beining Railway was jointly built with the United Kingdom. The road is on the coast and is threatened by foreign warships. Therefore, our country is now invaded in the hinterland. In order to revive China, we must first abolish the unequal treaties. (3) Although the March 18th Massacre was created, the imperialists saw that the people of the north had awakened, so they did not make further demands. From this, it can be seen that public opinion is the backing of diplomacy, which is even more obvious. (4) The masses can only be led into the right track and cannot be pressured to accept party tactics, only then can there be a solution. Duan Qirui did not understand this point at the time and hastily added pressure, which led to the March 18th Massacre. Duan's failure was also based on this. We have learned the best lesson from this case, and so on.</p>
<h3>Slogans</h3>
<p>(1) The March 18th Movement is the revolutionary movement of the people of Peiping. (2) To commemorate March 18th is to resist foreign aggression. (3) To commemorate March 18th is to eliminate the remnants of warlords. (4) The spirit of the martyrs of March 18th will never die. (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People. (6) Long live the Kuomintang. (7) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Citywide Alert</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Peiping People's Revolution Memorial Day. The City Public Security Bureau was deeply afraid that reactionary elements would take advantage of the Memorial Day to collude and cause disturbances, so it ordered the various district offices under its jurisdiction to increase the number of police officers on duty, divide them into shifts for patrol, implement extra security at key intersections, and inspect suspicious persons. Inspectors and detectives from the Supervisory Office and male and female inspectors set out separately to maintain strict vigilance. The police authorities of the two concessions also had the same security measures, paying particular attention to the areas near factories and schools to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Admiral Du Xigui's Funeral Service Held Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Chen's Naval Eulogy</h3>
<p>Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan's eulogy said: "On March 18th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Chen Shaokuan, Naval Minister, and all the officers and soldiers of the army, respectfully offer pure wine and delicious food to the spirit of Admiral Du Gongshenchen, saying: Alas, the country is in turmoil, and the world is chaotic. Outstanding people emerge in response to the times, and the martial arts flow forever. He had the ambition of a leopard and a famous dragon. He was the commander of the ships, brave and knowledgeable. The mainstay in the middle stream, political comeback. He has been experienced in the hub, and his past achievements have been used to show. Zhenyuan worked hard, and his legacy is boundless. He reached faraway with the messenger, and traveled around the maritime countries. Riding a raft to ask about customs, he followed the beauty of Ban Zhang. His huge anthology will forever show the way. There is a way to prosper the country, that is, talent and goodness. Cultivating people to educate talents is like pillars. Shenzhou is not peaceful, and the demon atmosphere is flying. The wind and cranes are alarmed at night, and they are also compared to the carp pond. The students are confused and helpless. They broke through the danger and took care of everything. He was indignant at the difficulties of the world and braved the wind and frost. Xiao Ji did not get up, riding a unicorn was a great waste. Summing up the public's ambitions, the legacy is abundant. The older he got, the stronger he became, and his heart was long for the country. He was determined to tide over the difficulties together. The way of heaven is unpredictable, and human affairs are impermanent. Taking away my senior official, how can I not be heartbroken? Hard work leads to illness, what a national tragedy. Thinking of the public's great achievements, the stars and moon are shining. Reading the public's posthumous works, the clouds and the Milky Way become chapters. This man is exhausted, how can the pain be forgotten. The mountains and rivers are covered with tears, and the beams and wood are heartbroken. Abandoning the world and passing away forever, where does the soul return? The heroic spirit is not far away, come and enjoy the fragrance. Alas, let me enjoy it."</p>

<h3>Eulogy of the Assembly</h3>
<p>March 18th, the 23rd year of the Republic of China. All colleagues of the memorial service respectfully offer condolences before the portrait of Mr. Zirang Yao and mourn him. The eulogy reads: Oh, the greatness of Mr. Yao, his achievements in industry are evident. His filial piety and fraternal love are outstanding, and his character and learning are equally remarkable. Tracing back to his early years in the imperial examinations, his name was highly regarded in the local school. And when he entered the Imperial Academy as a tribute student, he again captured the laurel in the autumn examination. He could have served in the government many times, but why did he choose to withdraw and hide? He wished to serve his hometown, managing the academy and charitable hall, overseeing the grain storage, and diligently sweeping and cleaning. He planned and designed the dredging of rivers and canals, rejoicing at the success of even the smallest endeavor. Towards the end of the Qing Dynasty, he assisted in the promotion of municipal affairs, transforming the academy into a local school, achieving a significant improvement. He established a public office for educational affairs, promoting the expansion of education. He participated in politics as a member of the council, like the net's main rope. With the change of times, he assisted in local affairs, participated in provincial meetings and discussions, understanding the advantages and disadvantages and providing thorough consideration. He then took a seat in the National Assembly, comparable to a phoenix on a high mountain. When local autonomy was suspended, he returned to his hometown. He served as a director in Shanghai, planning the expansion of elementary schools. He led the compilation of local chronicles, aiming to promote local autonomy and governance. He was ashamed of being persuaded to support the imperial system and refused to have his name listed in the correspondence. He oversaw the financial affairs of the entire county, diligently protecting his homeland. When the National Assembly was restored, he continued to serve and roam. He despised bribery in Qiao State and left with disappointment. He re-established a bureau for land surveying, diligently measuring the land. And when the reorganization was completed, he served as an extraordinary advisor. He used public opinion to correct public affairs, often raising his voice to speak out. He was upright and unyielding in the face of power and made sure to have a sharp edge. Alas, his life was close to eighty years, yet he was suddenly summoned by death. A pillar of strength has collapsed, and a beacon of guidance has been lost. Remembering his virtues to the hometown and country, we shed tears of sorrow. He is gone, but his memory should be worshiped by the community; how could we dare to forget him? Looking at his portrait and mourning him, flower rings spread their fragrance. May his spirit be active in the netherworld, his soul fluttering down to the vast wilderness.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for the Recovery of Inland River Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>Seizing the Opportunity to Cancel the Sino-British and Sino-American Shipping Treaties</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications, (salutation omitted) stating that on the 16th of this month, they received a letter from the Shanghai Inland River Steamer Industry Association stating that the association has been in charge of the Shanghai Inland River Steamer Industry for five years, and has been diligently working for the common welfare of the industry, daring not to slacken. Recalling when the association was first established, looking around at the inland river routes in the hinterland, they were all occupied by foreigners. The association felt deeply saddened and could not help but take action. Therefore, they immediately disregarded difficulties and dangers, did not yield to pressure, led the industry to strive and fight, and worked hard until now. They spent unlimited energy and money, and as a result, the inland river navigation rights in the hinterland related to the association were gradually recovered. Although this action is very small in scope, they dare not boast, but it has slightly asserted national rights. Therefore, the association, through its experience in these five years, deeply knows that in order to save the decline of our country's inland river navigation industry and achieve the goal of self-management by the Chinese people, it is necessary to cancel the unequal treaties between countries and recover our country's inland river navigation rights. It is understood that inland river navigation rights, in an independent country, should not be freely sailed by foreign ships. However, since the signing of unequal treaties during the Qing Dynasty, our country's inland river navigation rights have been held and manipulated by foreign merchants. Our country's shipping merchants have not been effectively protected and supported by the government, and have been oppressed by powerful foreign merchants, resulting in a complete collapse. It is no wonder that the association, being in this situation, feels deeply concerned. Thinking of this, they are extremely saddened. Now that they are aware that the Sino-American and Sino-British commercial and shipping treaties are about to expire, they dare not hesitate to speak out for all the inland river shipping merchants in our country. They respectfully request the association to promptly forward this to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, seizing this opportunity to seriously negotiate, cancel all unequal treaties, and strive to achieve the goal of recovering our country's inland river navigation rights. The country's future and the inland river shipping merchants all depend on this. The Chamber learned that the opening of inland ports for navigation began with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, but the area was still limited. Later, in the 24th year of the Guangxu Emperor, the General Administration of Customs independently submitted a memorial to the throne to open them up. Although there were no restrictions, the right to open them was still in our hands. When the Sino-British and Sino-American supplementary commercial treaties were signed, the regulations for inland port navigation independently determined by the General Administration of Customs were revised in many places, and these regulations were regarded as part of the treaty. Therefore, the situation of independently opening them up changed to a situation of negotiated opening, leading to a situation where all barriers were removed. Now that the treaty period has expired and the revision is proposed, it is urgent to recover them so that the inland river navigation rights can be complete. It is reasonable to telegraph your ministry for review and approval for implementation, which would be in the public interest. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders Strict Suppression of Pirates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Salted Fish Trade Association's members are all engaged in marine fishing. In recent years, pirates have been rampant, and the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have become dens for fugitives. Although there are dedicated marine protection agencies, their troops are not well-trained and their officials have no fixed responsibilities, resulting in unrest among the pirates and the fishing villages being in a state of decline. The association recently submitted a request based on the resolution of the representative assembly to Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission to place all marine suppression agencies under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy, dividing them into several security zones, and quickly suppressing them to save the endangered fishermen and merchants. Yesterday, they received the following order:</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Current Situation of the Extremely Declining Silk Weaving Industry in This City</h3>
<p>Only 2,500 Out of More Than 9,000 Looms Remain</p>
<p>Closures Follow One After Another, Those Struggling to Survive Also Reduce Wages</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, our country's silk weaving industry has been in extreme decline. The price of silk has fallen below cost. More than 9,000 looms in this city have been closed one after another, leaving only 2,500 looms. Those struggling to survive have reduced wages to maintain the status quo. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Extreme Decline: Silk mills export silk fabrics to foreign countries such as Nanyang and India. The annual export volume is about 18 million taels. Since the Chinese government twice increased the import tax on rayon in 1933 and 1932, the cost of Chinese silk has become too high. It is difficult to compete with Japanese goods sold in Nanyang, India, and other places. Also affected by the world economy, the export of Chinese silk has gradually decreased. To date, the total annual amount is only about two-tenths of the original amount. Domestically, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, sales have also sharply decreased. The price of silk has fallen below cost.</p>
<p>Gradual Closures: After the decline of the silk industry, the Shanghai-Hangzhou silk mills were unable to maintain operations and declared bankruptcy one after another. In this city alone, there were originally more than 9,000 looms. Since 1931, they have gradually closed. By April of last year, only 4,785 looms remained. Due to the decline in the market and the stagnation of sales, only 2,500 looms remained by the end of February this year, only about three-tenths of the original number. Among these 2,500 looms, the Meiya Factory accounts for half of them.</p>
<p>Wage Reductions: The 2,500 looms struggling to survive. Each factory believes that although there are many reasons for the recession, the high labor costs are the biggest problem. The Shanghai Electric Motor Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association held a meeting and decided to reduce wage standards. Each factory will reduce wages according to the factory's situation. Workers at factories such as Baohua, Yucun, Wanbao, Hengfeng, Jinxin, and Meiya, including their affiliated branches, opposed the wage reductions, which affected their livelihoods. Fortunately, the Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters worked hard to mediate. Except for Meiya, Hengfeng, Wanbao, and other factories have been resolved.</p>
<p>War Character No. 3279 approved the opening. It has been learned that the rampant pirates and the destruction of the fishing industry are indeed facts. However, the request to place all marine suppression agencies under the unified jurisdiction of various sections is inconsistent with administrative authority and is not easy to do. It is hoped that the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provincial governments and the Navy will be ordered to strictly order their subordinates to properly discuss military and police joint defense measures and earnestly suppress them. This order.</p>
<h3>France Will Increase Import Tariff on Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>—The Increased Tariff Exceeds More Than Double—</p>
<p>—If Implemented, It Will Be Severely Affected—</p>
<p>Our country's annual sales of tea to France are estimated at more than 15,000 dan, worth about 1 million yuan in national currency. It is now reported that the French government has decided to implement an increase in the import tariff on Chinese tea starting from April 1st. Comparing the current tax of 3.54 francs per kilogram of Chinese tea, the increased tariff exceeds more than double. If implemented, our country's tea exports to France will be severely affected.</p>
<h3>Central Road Bloodshed</h3>
<p>An Old Cake Seller Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Suicide or Murder?</p>
<p>An old cake seller, a native of Pudong, aged sixty, with an unknown surname, is known for selling cakes and cigarettes. He has set up his stall in a small alley on Central Road between Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road for more than 20 years. Therefore, all the peddlers nearby, as well as the servants of various foreign firms, know him. The old man's residence is in a wooden house in the small alley. Last June, the house was demolished, and the old man lost his shelter. He then discussed with Ni Renchang and He Ahua, Ningbo people who were in charge of looking after the house at No. 21 Central Road, and chose a residence on the third floor of the house. The old man also has a concubine, about forty years old, who comes every day to assist him in his business and leaves after closing. The old man also goes out one or two nights a week and does not return. The day before yesterday (the 17th), the old man went out again in the evening, but he had not returned by noon yesterday. At the same time, Ni and He also found it strange that they had not seen the old man and thought he was still asleep on the third floor. They went to call him and pushed open the door, only to see the old man lying on the ground. They touched him, and he was cold and had stopped breathing. He had been dead for a long time. The two were shocked and quickly ran out to report to the patrol post, who forwarded the report to the Central Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. They saw a pool of blood on the corpse. There was a knife wound on the side of the neck of the deceased, measuring about seven inches in length. The blood flowed from the wound. The cake stand was lying beside him. It is impossible to speculate whether he was murdered or committed suicide. It will only be clear after the police arrest the old man's concubine.</p>
<h3>Hu Ganqing's Extramarital Affair Case Contesting Inheritance</h3>
<p>Ganqing's Son, Shanqing, Is Sued in the Special Court</p>
<p>Witnesses Do Not Acknowledge That the Extramarital Affair Has a Daughter</p>
<p>Hu Xue, a woman from Suzhou, and her daughter, Qiaoyun, recently hired a lawyer to sue Hu Shanqing, the son of the deceased Hu Ganqing from Hangzhou, for failing to hand over the inheritance, including a residence on Guling Road and shares in Fuchang Ginseng Shop and Hu Qingyu Pharmacy, estimated at 300,000 yuan, seeking one-third of the inheritance and alimony in the First Special District Court. The case has been heard once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong presided over the continued hearing in the Sixth Civil Court. The defendant, Hu Shanqing, hired lawyers Lin Lanqing and Lu Shaozong to defend him. According to Hu, Ganqing was my late father, who passed away on June 14th, 1930. My mother, Wang, is still alive. He had two concubines, both surnamed Li, who had no children. I have one son, named Shiwei, who is fourteen years old and is studying at a school in my hometown, only at the junior high school level. My late father's inheritance consists only of the residence on Guling Road and a small number of shares in Fuchang Ginseng Shop and Qingyu Hall Pharmacy. There is no large sum of cash. The plaintiff is my late father's concubine, named Lao Si. She never came to the house in the past, only once on the day before my father's death, hoping to see him. Her daughter, Qiaoyun, is a complete stranger and is not my father's child. She was never brought to our home. After my father's death, I gave her 3,000 yuan, which was deposited in Fuchang Ginseng Shop, as a means of severing relations forever. However, there was no contract for this money. Between 1932 and 1933, she withdrew the money from the shop. I did not know where she lived with my father when he was alive. Therefore, her request to divide the inheritance is completely unfounded. My wife, Huang, is living in Hangzhou due to disagreements, and so on. The plaintiff's lawyer presented three letters from the defendant's son, Shiwei, who was entrusted by Xue to handle matters from Hangzhou to Shanghai, recognizing her as his step-grandmother. According to Huang's testimony, Shanqing is my husband, and we are currently renting a house in Jiuqu Lane in Hangzhou. Xue did come to the old house on Guling Road once the day before my father-in-law's death. I do not know her daughter, Qiaoyun. I am not sure if my son, Shiwei, wrote a letter to her. However, my father-in-law once mentioned that Xue was</p>
<h3>Admired in a Brothel</h3>
<p>Around 1926, I do not know the details. According to Kong Shenfu's testimony, I am the manager of Fuchang Ginseng Shop on Xian Gua Street in Nanshi. Ganqing is one of the shareholders. His first wife lives in Hangzhou and has one son, namely the defendant, Shanqing. He does not have a daughter. He also has two concubines, not Xue. The plaintiff came during Ganqing's funeral. I did not see her daughter, Qiaoyun. There was a deposit of 3,000 yuan in Xue's name in the shop. The deposit was made in 1927. The following year, Ganqing withdrew it. I do not know who Xue is. After Ganqing's death, his son, Shanqing, made another deposit of 3,000 yuan in Xue's name. Later, Xue withdrew the money in installments until 1933. According to Hu Musheng's testimony, Ganqing is my cousin. Around 1928 and 1929, he lived with the plaintiff in Yuren Lane on Yunnan Road. When I went there, I learned that her name was Lao Si. She used to be a prostitute in Minhe Lane. I did not see Qiaoyun. There was often a girl in the back room. The plaintiff came when Ganqing died. She did not bring Qiaoyun with her. Later, she said she</p>
<h3>Had No Money to Live On</h3>
<p>I discussed with my sister-in-law to give Lao Si 30 yuan per month to maintain her livelihood. My sister-in-law did not agree, so I took it upon myself to pay her monthly. Ganqing told me about the 3,000 yuan for the plaintiff when he was seriously ill. Later, the plaintiff always felt it was not enough, so I advised her to live with my sister-in-law. She said that it was not appropriate for Qiaoyun, which clearly showed that the girl was not Ganqing's own child. The plaintiff is here now, and I am not lying. According to Yu Yangzhou's testimony, I am the assistant manager in Fuchang. I was invited by a Cantonese guest surnamed Guo to visit the plaintiff at Minhe Lane on Sanma Road. Her stage name is Miao Ji Xiuzhen, also known as Lao Si. Later, she became intimate with Ganqing and rented a house in Yuren Lane. I also went there once in 1928, but I did not see a girl. Hu Xue said that she lived with Ganqing in 1917. She lived in Mali Shi. The following year, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, she gave birth to her daughter, Qiaoyun. She said that it was inconvenient for the Hangzhou wife, so she stayed in her mother's home in Suzhou for two years. Later, she came to Shanghai again and still lived in Mali Shi. When her daughter was seven years old, she moved to Yuren Lane. Qiaoyun is her own daughter and is now seventeen years old. She can come to court next time. Judge Shen adjourned the hearing until a later date for further verification.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Straw Houses Burned Down on Qushen Temple Road</h3>
<p>Fire Starter Gong Dianqing Interrogated</p>
<p>The straw house without a house number where Gong Dianqing, a rickshaw puller from Qingjiang, lived on Qushen Temple Road in Nanshi, caught fire at around 4 o'clock yesterday morning due to carelessness, turning into a raging inferno. When nearby patrol officer Ni Xuexi discovered the fire, he immediately reported it to the Hounan fire brigades, who quickly rushed to the scene with their pumps and hoses to extinguish the fire. By around 6 o'clock, the fire was extinguished, but more than 100 straw houses had been burned down. Most of them were inhabited by laborers. More than 100 families were affected. At the time, the neighbors were awakened from their sleep and helped each other, leading the elderly and children to escape for their lives. The sounds of weeping were endless, and the scene was truly pitiful and unbearable to witness. Li, the district chief of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led the police to suppress the situation, maintain order, and investigate the cause of the fire. Gong Dianqing, the fire starter, was taken to the district for interrogation and sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for questioning today.</p>
<h3>Foreign Soldiers Assault People</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 last night, three foreign soldiers had an argument with the patrol officers at the entrance of Dexing Lane on West New Bridge Street in the French Concession. Their voices were loud, and they almost used force. There were many onlookers. A passerby was kicked in the lower part by a foreign soldier and fainted to the ground. The foreign soldiers, seeing that they had caused trouble, tried to escape to the west. The passersby and patrol officers chased and caught one of them and detained him in the Songshan Road Police Station for investigation. The injured person was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injury affected the internal organs, and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Nontoxic Pigment Factory Commences Production</h3>
<p>Overseen by Technician Zhou Zhenjun</p>
<p>Daily Output Estimated at Four or Five Loads</p>
<p>Historically, green tea exported from our country is often colored during production to cater to the preferences of people in African and Russian regions. The pigments used are divided into three types: sand green, three fish, yellow righteousness, and record yellow. However, last year, Filipinos strongly claimed that our country's green tea contained toxic substances, and they boycotted it, causing a major blow to the sales of Chinese tea in the Philippines. In order to save the decline and enhance international trade reputation, the Ministry of Industry specifically ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to implement a ban. After receiving the order, the bureau, in addition to formulating ban measures to be implemented when new tea is on the market this year, also designated technician Zhou Zhenjun to carefully research and produce a variety of non-toxic yellow pigments to replace them. After tea merchants tested it and were satisfied, they decided to set up a factory to manufacture it and cooperate with tea merchants. It has now been properly discussed, with the Tea Industry Association contributing capital of 1,500 yuan and the Foreign Tea Industry Association contributing 500 yuan, for a total of 2,000 yuan. In terms of personnel, a cooperative system is adopted, with the Commodity Inspection Bureau assigning technician Zhou to supervise the manufacturing. The position of manager has been assigned to Zheng Jianyuan, executive member of the Tea Industry Association. The factory is located on Baoxing Road in Zhabei and started production yesterday. It is reported that the results are very good, with a daily output estimated at four or five loads.</p>

<h3>Silk Industry Bank Creates Kaiyuan Savings</h3>
<p>The savings department of the Silk Industry Bank on Shilu Hankou Road in this city has always been dedicated to serving the community. It has created various new savings schemes, which have been deeply appreciated by all sectors. Because the Nanshi branch of the bank is about to open, it has also created the Kaiyuan Savings Regulations, also known as the "Interest-Generating Interest Savings." The method is excellent and unprecedented. The preamble and method are recorded below. Opening up sources of income and reducing expenditure are the principles of financial management. In today's world, it is especially important to adopt a [planned economic strategy] to seek a prosperous life and family happiness. Furthermore, the burden of ordinary people's lives generally increases with age. Once they encounter major events such as marriage, they feel especially burdened. Therefore, to seek sufficient resources, it is best to prepare a method of opening up sources of income to prepare for temporary use. The bank has formulated Kaiyuan Savings Regulations based on the [New Five-Year Plan] to enable depositors to have a stable income every five years, which can be used continuously. This savings plan assumes a principal of 1,500 yuan. At the end of five years, the entire principal will be repaid. Thereafter, every five years, that is, at the tenth, fifteenth, and twentieth years, interest of 1,000 yuan will be paid on schedule. If the depositor has an urgent need before the due date, the principal can be mortgaged for use, and the interest can also be withdrawn early in accordance with the regulations. It is said that the starting point for this savings plan is 150 yuan per household, with a maximum limit of 15,000 yuan. There are also preferential measures for opening an account during the opening of the branch.</p>
<h3>Hu Yazhou Obstructs Court Order</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Five Days Detention</p>
<p>Hu Yazhou (also known as Yazhou) from Hangzhou, due to suspicion of abetting the daughter of Wei Zichun, a defendant in a counterfeit currency case, in the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, was discovered by Judge Yu. Judge Yu also believed that Hu's testimony in the Wu Xinwu and Fang Yexian embezzlement case was false and was handed over to detectives from the General Police Department for detention and investigation. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police department escorted Hu to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, requesting detention. Qian Xunjiu, the police department's lawyer, presented the case, stating that the defendant was guilty of destroying evidence in violation of Article 175 of the Criminal Law. Hu had previously been sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year reprieve for embezzlement. Judge Zhan Liangce questioned Hu, who stated that he was asking his wife for a handkerchief that day, and the girl Wei Jindi happened to be sitting next to him, which led to the belief that he was abetting her testimony. He requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhan stated that Hu did not maintain order in the courtroom and ran around arbitrarily, violating court order. He ordered that Hu Yazhou not be detained, and the matter of obstructing order was transferred to the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court for review. The police department immediately escorted Hu to the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court. Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhou and Jiang, and Chief Prosecutor Wang, held a hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the police department's lawyer, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 61, Section 3 of the Court Organization Law.

<h3>Laborer Dies a Tragic Death</h3>
<p>Li Shubing, also known as Bingrong, from Shandong, around 30 years old, resided at No. 8, Yongle Lane, Xinqiao Head, Chinese Concession. He worked as a laborer at the Xinlinji Construction Factory on Xujiahui Road. Recently, he was working on the construction site of the French Barracks Hospital at No. 75, Fulvli Road, French Concession, which was being built by Xinlinji. At noon on the 16th, Li was transporting cement materials to the third floor. On his way back down, as he walked on the stairs of the second floor, a heavy wooden plank suddenly fell from the scaffolding above and struck Li's head. His skull was shattered instantly, and blood flowed. He fainted and fell to the ground. The factory owner, Qi Xielin, sent someone to transport Li to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severe head injury, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 9 AM the next day. The hospital notified the Central Police Department, which dispatched detectives to transport the body to the morgue for examination. They also went to the construction site to investigate the circumstances of the deceased's injury. It is expected that a request will be made to the Second Special District Court today to send personnel for inspection. It is said that the deceased's family members are all in his hometown, in the countryside, and relied on the deceased alone to make a living and support them in Shanghai. Now that he has suddenly suffered an unfortunate and tragic death, the family's livelihood will be difficult to imagine.</p>
<h3>Unemployed for Half a Year, Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Lin Shizi, a 36-year-old man from Fuzhou, lived upstairs in the Wan Taixiang cigarette paper shop at No. 419, Huanlong Road, French Concession. He used to work as a waiter for a foreigner but had been unemployed for nearly half a year. He had repeatedly asked relatives and friends to recommend him for jobs, but it was difficult to find one. Moreover, he had no savings, so for the past six months, he had pawned and sold all his clothes. Recently, as daily life became more and more difficult, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. On the morning of the 16th, he went out and bought several opium bubbles and swallowed them at his residence around 9 AM. At the time of the suicide, Chen Zeren, a 16-year-old apprentice from the Wan Taixiang cigarette paper shop downstairs (who was also from the same hometown as the deceased), happened to go upstairs to use the toilet. He caught a glimpse of Lin swallowing opium bubbles with tea. Chen mistook Lin for eating a snack and jokingly said to him, "What good things are you eating? Why don't we all have some?" After speaking, he rushed forward to snatch it away. Lin desperately stuffed it into his mouth. Then Chen saw that Lin's fingers and palms were stained with opium residue and was shocked. He asked Lin what he swallowed, but Lin refused to say. He realized that it was a suicide attempt. Chen did not even have time to relieve himself and rushed downstairs to inform the shop owner, who sent someone to call Lin Zengyan, Lin's nephew (22 years old, also a waiter), who lived at No. 56, South Qianjiatang. They rushed Lin to the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road for rescue. Unfortunately, the opium poison had spread deeply in Lin's abdomen, and treatment was ineffective. He died at the hospital at 8:30 AM the next morning. The hospital reported it to the French Police Department, which sent detective Zhang Chunsheng to investigate the cause of the deceased's suicide. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Because yesterday was Sunday, a request will be made to the Second Special District Court today to send personnel for inspection.</p>

The first ship, carried by the British ship Reemosai, carries a total of 7,325 tons, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

<h3>Letter Requesting Participation in the Capital National Exhibition</h3>
<p>A Letter from the Ministry of Industry Exhibition Hall to the National Goods Factory Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association received a letter from the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry yesterday stating that, in recent years, the dumping of foreign goods has been like a surging tide. The whole country has been unanimously calling for the promotion of national goods in order to resist and save the situation. The exhibition hall's duties lie in making great efforts to promote the goods in order to achieve practical results. It has been decided to hold a spring national goods exhibition in the capital on April 20 this year, which has been approved by the Ministry of Industry. The association has always been enthusiastic about the national goods movement. Last year, the exhibition hall organized the opening of the exhibition and was deeply grateful for the association's leadership in bringing various factories to Beijing to participate. The results were remarkable. This time, we are organizing the opening of the exhibition, but we are afraid that our efforts will be insufficient to achieve significant results. However, the capital is what foreigners are concerned about, and what the whole country is watching. We rely on the association's support and leadership of Shanghai national goods factories to participate enthusiastically in order to make it a grand event and promote it widely.</p>

<p>Reading Q &amp; A</p>
<h3>Reading Addiction</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance</p>
<p>After reading your discussion on reading methods last time, I roughly understood some reading techniques, but I still have a question for you to advise me on.</p>
<p>It is quite embarrassing to say, but I am determined to read. Therefore, I set a schedule in advance, specified the time, and prepared the books. However, in reality, I don't know why, I never follow the original plan. When the scheduled reading time arrives, something always happens temporarily, and I am reluctant to read. For example, I am supposed to start reading at 7:00 PM and continue until 10:00 PM. However, when 7:00 PM arrives, I sometimes suddenly feel a little tired and hope to rest for a moment before reading. But after resting again and again, my energy still doesn't pick up, and almost half of the reading time has passed. So I simply harden my heart and postpone reading until tomorrow, deciding to go to bed and rest today. Sometimes, even if I am not tired, I always feel that the environment is not good, either complaining that the light is not bright enough or hating that the chair is too uncomfortable... and so on. In short, when I am doing things during the day, I always plan what books to read that evening, but when evening comes, the original plan is rarely realized. However, sir, please don't misunderstand me. My inability to read at the scheduled time is not entirely due to things happening beforehand. I do sometimes start reading on time, but after turning a few pages, problems arise. If I have eaten too much, my stomach feels bloated, and if I have eaten too little, I feel hungry. But if I don't read and do something else, these problems never arise. Sir, please don't laugh at me. It's not that I don't have the determination to read. After I decide not to read and go to bed, I feel very ashamed and often hate myself for not having perseverance and courage. I also hope that I can get rid of these demons' entanglement in the future. But day after day, these demons are never eliminated, and instead, they cause me great mental pain. Sir, what is the reason for this, and is there a way to solve it? If not, I might as well be honest and stop thinking about reading. I hope you can give me a satisfactory answer so that I won't be disappointed. (Letter from Zheng Jiebo)</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's problem is indeed common among people, so there is no need to feel ashamed. However, it is difficult to cure, but not impossible. We only need to find out the cause of the illness, and there is indeed a solution. According to my personal experience (because I have also suffered from it), the reason for this problem is roughly due to: (1) A restless mind that cannot calm down; (2) Not having formed a reading habit; (3) Being busy with work and needing rest during leisure time, making it impossible to read further; (4) Lacking patience for reading; (5) An unsuitable reading environment (including personal physical condition and surrounding things), etc. But the above are only secondary reasons. The main reason is that although we quite like reading, it is only an empty wish, not a willingness to read because of the results of reading. In simple terms, we have not yet become addicted to reading. People who are addicted to reading want to read at all times. For example, you want to read now simply because you want to understand more and know more. As for what you want to understand, it is still very vague. Therefore, it is only an empty wish and cannot be considered a pressing motivation for reading. But if you are studying economics and have read Eli's [Outlines of Economics], you think you already understand what economics is. But later, you want to go further and buy Kawakami Hajime's [Outline of Economics] to read. Then you have a problem. Both books are about economics, but why is the content so different? Which explanation is correct? In this way, a problem arises in your mind. But at this time, although the problem arises, it will not discourage you but will instead increase your desire for research and knowledge. This problem is like a big stone in your heart that you have to find a way to move. But how to move it? To move it, you have to do further research. In other words, you have to read more. The more you read, the stronger your interest becomes. This is called addiction, which is the same as being addicted to mahjong, opium, or movies. It is all caused by habit.</p>
<p>This is certainly the main reason, but the above-mentioned secondary reasons for reading can also affect you and prevent you from reading. You are supposed to read from 7:00 to 10:00, and perhaps you have added a strong guarantee to this schedule, that is, you are determined not to do anything else during this time. But when it is time to read, or after you have read a few pages, you suddenly have an impulse and think that the man who was running with your lover might be another man. In this way, your attention will not be able to stay on the book, and you will not be able to study commodities and money (if you are reading Kawakami's Economics on page 21). Instead, you will be estimating and speculating whether your lover is faithful to you. Therefore, a restless mind is absolutely not conducive to reading. Similarly, fatigue and the reading environment can also affect your reading. This influence is also very great, and there are many ways to overcome it. These methods cannot be detailed here, but fortunately, there are already special books explaining them. I can simply introduce that book to you. That book is Zheng's translation of the Commercial Press edition of [How to Improve Study Efficiency].</p>
<p>But Mr. Zheng may ask, even if we remove all the external or internal obstacles to our reading environment, will we necessarily be able to read? Because how can someone without a reading addiction become addicted? I can answer him in this way: [You can learn the methods of becoming addicted to cigarettes or opium.] People who smoke cigarettes for the first time often feel headaches, but they still want to smoke. After smoking for a long time, they become addicted. Reading for the first time is the same. They often feel the pain of reading, such as the book being too difficult, not being able to understand, being dry and tasteless, etc. But if they read a lot, these problems will greatly change, difficult becomes easy, unable to understand becomes fully understood, and dry and tasteless becomes flavorful. Therefore, a person who is truly determined to research and reads automatically should not be discouraged by the difficulties at the beginning. It should be known that no matter how successful a scholar is, they do not understand everything when they start reading. If they understand everything at first reading, when we praise someone's knowledge, we would not say [studied ×× for twenty years] or [studied ×× abroad for × years]. A teacher of mine once said well, [...... What is there to be afraid of not understanding? Even the author of the book is only telling you what he understands. What he doesn't understand is even more, but he is too embarrassed to write it out for you to read......]</p>
<p>What Mr. Zheng said about [I don't know why] is probably that reading cannot arouse interest, and the reason why it cannot arouse interest is probably that reading often encounters difficulties, etc. Therefore, we believe that for people like Mr. Zheng who are starting to read, in addition to paying attention to the objective reading environment, they must also be determined, not afraid of all disturbances, and force themselves to read. They must not shrink back because reading is not very interesting, because interest is generated slowly. At the same time, don't be discouraged if you don't understand what you are reading. If we can understand everything now, we don't need to do research or read. The reason why we want to read is to turn what we don't understand into what we do understand.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Fight</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, until now, more than twenty years, which year has there been no war? Which year has there been no fighting? Province A fights with Province B, Zhang San fights with Li Si, and sometimes even people of the same surname fight each other. If political views don't align, they fight; if rights are unequal, they fight. They mobilize troops and horses at the slightest pretext, accumulate grass and store grain, fighting back and forth, never ceasing. I wonder how much money has been spent on fighting? I wonder how many lives have been lost? No wonder people come to [take advantage of the chaos,] losing several provinces of land to the fighting. So why aren't they afraid of fighting like this? Is it just that the Chinese people's characteristic is that they prefer to fight? How can it be seen? Listen to me explain!</p>
<p>Clearly using the telephone, but calling it [fighting the telephone;] clearly sending a telegram, but calling it [fighting the telegram;] filing a lawsuit, calling it [fighting a lawsuit;] calculating discounts, calling it [fighting a discount;] inquiring about news, calling it [fighting to inquire;] drafting an article, calling it [fighting a draft;] speaking Mandarin, calling it [fighting Mandarin;] shooting at riddles, calling it [fighting lantern riddles;] cooperating in business, calling it [fighting a company;] the night watchman striking the gong, calling it [fighting the night watch;] a woman putting on makeup, calling it [fighting to dress up;] signaling to each other, calling it [fighting to greet;] singing tanhuang opera, calling it [fighting the mountain head;] gifting presents, hoping for a generous return, calling it [fighting to get a windfall;] secretly cheating, enriching oneself, calling it [fighting to grease one's palm;] an engineer drawing a diagram, calling it [fighting a design;] buying lottery tickets, calling it [fighting to get rich tickets;]... What the mouth says, what the ears hear, almost everything is fighting, fighting in the east, fighting in the west. No wonder they fight until everything is destroyed and the people are impoverished, so-called [fighting until everything is gone].</p>
<p>I say that all my fellow citizens, from now on, stop fighting, recuperate and build strength to become self-reliant. Don't fight unless you have to; a fight should be startling. Don't fight ourselves, fight the enemy. Let's all gather our spirits, make up our minds, plan the path to save the country, and break down the concept of class. Everyone does their proper profession, everyone takes their due responsibility, don't be confused and muddled anymore, [sitting and nodding off, doing nothing after eating your fill]. Vow not to smoke, no need to fight any opium dens; resolve not to frequent prostitutes, no need to fight any prostitutes; with a stable job, where is there time to fight any mahjong? If life can be stable, who would want to engage in this life of striking people with clubs? Then smoking will be eradicated without prohibition, prostitution will be eliminated without abolishment, gambling will be swept away, banditry will be extinguished forever, the area will be peaceful, and the people will be harmonious and happy. From now on, there will be no more [meaningless fighting].</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Renwei</p>
<p>To eliminate boredom and烦恼, and prevent a person's emotions and thoughts from leading to a pessimistic state, how important it is for us to seek appropriate entertainment! We are now living a complex social life, which can easily stimulate our nerves, and the only good way to eliminate this stimulation is entertainment.</p>
<p>If we were like those optimistic celebrities and reclusive hermits, not in contact with the actual society, entrusting our elegant thoughts to poetry, lyrics, and songs, or holding a pot of Longjing tea every day, or carrying a caged bird, chatting with others about interesting events from ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, we might be able to broaden our minds and be physically and mentally healthy; but in reality, we fundamentally do not like such a numb environment, and secondly, we do not have such leisure. In order to find food, we work seven or eight hours a day.</p>
<p>So what we need now is after-work entertainment, but what is so-called after-work entertainment like in Shanghai? Look! It's either gambling activities such as horse racing,球类 games (like jai alai), poker, and mahjong, or low-level interest观剧 or逛游乐场. These meaningless and low-level entertainment, not only can not eliminate刺激, (maybe can temporarily forget pain,) but also can completely invade our正当的意向 or instead increase some unexpected stimulation.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has worked as a clerk for a few years and seemed to be in comfortable circumstances. Recently, I don't know why, he suddenly became pessimistic, not only did his thoughts suddenly become absolutely leftist, but he even tried to commit suicide by drinking and色情 every day. At first, I asked him what was the reason, but he refused to announce it clearly; it was not until later that I learned that he had been a gambler for eight months and倾了 all his savings; 想再从工作上 to make up,也不有具征了. He also thought that this was the sin of urban society, 是环境害了他; in fact, he根本没有懂得娱乐的真实性.</p>
<p>There are many such examples.我想··一个人如果不和这种罪恶去接触, it 总不至于会找上门来吧!</p>
<p>If we can put the sinful part of this entertainment aside and find some fresh and beneficial scientific games,郊外旅行, all kinds of soft and suitable exercise,玩玩音乐｜｜也许会从灰尘里见到晴空, from darkness 中发现光明,不至于由娱乐而走上更悲观的境地.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Comics</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun writes, Lian Liang draws</p>
<p>[Love and Studying]</p>
<p>College is the most ardent time for romance; what's written with blue ink isn't always textbooks, but love letters as fragrant as flowers, as beautiful as birds, as sweet as spring; secret loves behind the scenes, secret vows within hearts, someone once said that only with love can one study, without love, one abandons books to join the army and kill the enemy; but this is rather farcical!</p>
<p>Some say ... there is the light of love to encourage studying, some say ... with love, there is no heart for studying. I don't know which is really correct.</p>
<h3>The Four Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 26: Generously Baring One's Soul to Forget the Family and Serve the Nation, Sadly Facing the Jade Mirror to Grieve for a Loved One</p>
<p>No matter how hard-hearted a person may be, when they see others suffering the same pain they once experienced, they cannot help but feel sympathy for them. Moreover, their own suffering is completely stirred up by this shared empathy. At this moment, Zhao Ziqiang occupied the house of this newlywed couple, driving them out. He felt deeply sorry about it, so he stared blankly at the wall. Turning his head, he saw Wang Shili tidying up the house, and he shook his head at him, saying, "No need, no need! Let's find another place." Wang Shili smiled and said, "All the houses in this fortress are the same. You won't find anything better anywhere else." Ziqiang sighed and said, "That's not what I meant. Look at how well this young couple was doing, sleeping happily together on the kang just this morning. Now we've come and driven them out. It feels a bit sinful. How about the house next door? Let's move there." Wang Shili laughed and said, "Here we have a young couple, but in the house next door there's an old couple. If we drive out the old couple to let the young couple back in, what kind of justice is that? Besides, the old couple of today is just the young couple of the past transformed. We should just rely on luck. If we run into a young couple's house, then the young couple leaves. If we run into an old couple's house, then the old couple leaves. That's the fairest way." Ziqiang smiled upon hearing this, but he didn't say the reason why he felt compelled to act this way. Two hours later, all the luggage carts, large and small, were dragged into the fortress. Everyone began to settle in separately. The residents who hadn't fled, seeing that the soldiers who arrived were only borrowing houses and not doing anything else, found them much more civilized than the provincial army that had come to the fortress before. So, after going out for half a day to check the fortress and finding no signs of destruction, they gradually returned (339).</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (5)</h3>
<p>— A Bored Fellow</p>
<p>(3) The Transformation of Art from Aristocratic to Popular</p>
<p>Since the art of inkstones originated in the imperial court, it naturally had various aristocratic characteristics. The main points are twofold. First, the inkstones were large in size. After the Tang and Song dynasties, princes and dukes enjoyed calligraphy as a pastime, with large desks and attendants to wash their brushes, clean their inkstones, and hold their paper. They only cared about beauty and comfort, and didn't worry about the weight of the inkstones. This style persisted until the Ming Dynasty. However, as the love for inkstones spread among the common people, the excessive size became inconvenient. Carrying them was difficult, and wasting precious stone was a pity. Moreover, the inkstones of the time mostly had shallow and narrow ink pools, which were not very practical. Therefore, the shape of the inkstones was gradually reduced in size, and people sought various aesthetic and practical improvements within the smaller form, leading to a transformation of the inkstone's shape.</p>
<p>I own a pair of brow-shaped She inkstones, which are very large in size with wide edges and narrow pools. I initially didn't understand their purpose, but later I learned that it was the fashion in the Song Dynasty to grind ink straight, not diagonally or circularly. [Chao Yidao of the Song Dynasty wrote in his "Ink Manual" that "straight grinding is the best, as it reveals the true color of the ink and does not damage it. Circular grinding relies on heavy force and generates wind, which helps the color but is not the true color of the ink."] Reading this, I realized why ancient inkstones often had narrow and elongated ink pools. It was because the aristocratic class had servants to grind the ink for them, not caring about the time it took, and slowly grinding to achieve fineness. Therefore, straight grinding was preferred. However, after popularization, people found circular grinding faster and more convenient, and considered these large, straight-grinding inkstones impractical, gradually storing them away. Therefore, some have survived to this day.</p>
<p>Second, the carving aspects were also aristocratic. The carvings on inkstones mostly depicted subjects such as the sun, moon, stars, dragons, tigers, wind, clouds, pavilions, and towers, with extreme intricacy and including some decorations with the implicit meaning of glorifying peace within their stately splendor. The names seen in illustrated catalogs, such as "May Heaven Protect You," "Preserve Harmony," "Phoenix Dancing and Dragon Soaring," "Adding Years to the Sea House," "Five Peaks Paying Homage to Heaven," "Peace Reigns Supreme," "Auspicious Stars and Auspicious Clouds," "Longevity Mountain and Blessed Sea," "Transforming the World into Peace," "Blessings from Heaven," and "Embroidered Emperor's Robes," are all examples. Later, as times changed, scholars and poets found them somewhat vulgar and sought alternative paths. They took inspiration from landscape paintings for their carvings, striving for elegance and refinement. They also poured their heart and soul into the exquisite craftsmanship of poetry, lyrics, inscriptions, and colophons, and sought famous iron-pen engravers skilled in carving (especially those who could write themselves).</p>
<p>The engravings by the artist are especially precious.) Early Qing Dynasty scholars would display them on their desks or gift them to friends; these were all of this kind. Therefore, the fashion for carving also underwent a transformation.</p>
<p>Short News: Wire mesh fences are the most needed material for modern construction. Whether for residences, gardens, ball fields, factories, schools, or station docks, for strong and spectacular protection, they are an indispensable installation. Yangshupu Gongqin Iron Factory is the first factory to produce domestic wire mesh fences. The factory can design for customers and supply all materials, it is said.</p>

<h3>Donghua Suffers a Miserable Defeat to the French Businessmen After Conceding a Penalty in the Last Three Minutes</h3>
<p>3-4 Donghua Takes the Lead Twice in the First Ten Minutes But Ultimately Loses</p>
<p>The French Businessmen League Championship is Thus Confirmed</p>
<p>The special West League Group A football match between the French Businessmen and Donghua was held at the baseball field as per order. However, the French Businessmen protested, fortunately resulting in Donghua losing by three to four. A major event thus concluded. Over five thousand people watched. Because it was previously suspected that the French Businessmen might also be absent at the last minute, many hesitated to come. Under heavy pressure, Donghua managed to take the lead against the French Businessmen twice, but unfortunately lost due to a penalty kick in the end. Is it not a pity to decide the victory or defeat in this way? And the French Businessmen's Group A championship is declared confirmed.</p>
<h3>Performance is Commendable</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianyan of Donghua went abroad, and Li Ning and Tu Kaiyuan were injured and did not play. The strength was naturally not as great as in the past. In the first half, facing the wind and sun, they suffered greatly, but managed to gain an advantage with a one-to-one score, which is commendable. In the second half, the attack was stronger, and they once led by three to two. If they hadn't conceded a penalty at that time, they wouldn't have lost by three to four, or at least could have maintained a three-three draw. Although the Donghua lineup was changed, each player was able to fulfill their duties quite well. Lu Zhongen's upper body skills were more solid, calmly taking the ball out of danger under heavy pressure, which is due to his expertise in basketball. His positioning still needs improvement. Chen Gongyu's footwork and header are already comparable to Guan Xun'an. Guan resisted the most fiercely, coordinating with Chen Neng. Outside of the central defenders Feng Yunyou and Wu Youliang, Chen Hongguang took over Tu's position. Feng's physical strength is gradually recovering, Wu Youliang's skills have improved, and Chen Hongguang's performance in his new position has been great. The five forwards were used skillfully, the left side being stronger and the right side weaker. There is a lack of adequate connection between the central defenders and the forwards, otherwise there would have been an even better performance.</p>
<h3>Li and Dai Both Achieve Great Merit</h3>
<p>With the deployment well-planned, Donghua, in the north, kicked off facing the sun. Costantini and A. Dailey tangled fiercely. Remidi rushed out from the side to save the ball from danger. After a long back and forth, Wu Youliang immediately sent the ball to Jia Youliang. On the western frontier, Pike couldn't stop him. Reaching the low line, he crossed the ball, and A. Dailey received it. After a slight spin, he powerfully shot at the goal. Fulu Shou couldn't save it, eliciting applause from the audience. Soon after, Little Jia entered the heavy encirclement again. Pike's obstruction was improper and was judged a foul. Wu Youliang sent the ball in front of the goal, and Li Yichen headed it. The ball was as fast as an arrow, directly piercing the net. Donghua thus took a two-to-zero lead.</p>
<h3>French Fafan Xiao Recaptures a City</h3>
<p>Kicking off again, Donghua's momentum increased. Marcel three times single-handedly blocked the Caobiao Pass, still sighing at the inability to defeat the many with the few. Li Yichen and Little Hua privately colluded, mixing into the defense. Nicolov rushed over, and Li suddenly passed to Li Rongan, who was lying in ambush on the western outskirts. He shot at the goal, but unfortunately, it was two feet off, failing to materialize. This aroused the anger of the entire French Businessmen team. Little Hua rebelled from the special border defense, being cunning and clever, and both. Wu Youliang lost two passes, Guan Xun'an arrived in time, but the ball had already flown towards the goal. Fafan was able to get it and shoot, and Lu Damen was caught off guard. The score thus became two to one. After this, Donghua's attack was still strong, but the French Businessmen had reinforced their troops and defended firmly. Although there were many close calls, fortunately, no disaster occurred. The first half passed quickly.</p>
<h3>Collett Scores to Tie the Game</h3>
<p>Switching sides, after the kickoff, Donghua immediately used a lightning-fast plan. Little Wan carried the ball to attack. Two Li's and one Dai, like tigers entering a flock of sheep, in an instant, the French Businessmen's forbidden zone was filled with scattered shadows and flying iron cavalry. Nicolov had no choice but to concede a corner kick. Little Wan kicked it in, Pike headed it out, Feng Yunyou rushed over and shot powerfully, but it was again slapped into a corner kick by Fulu Shou. Little Wan kicked again, Marcel headed it out, and Wu Youliang tried his best to sweep it, and the ball flew high. Little Huat got the opportunity and fiercely attacked. He picked the ball into the goal area, and Collett swept it sideways. Although Lu Zhongen turned to protect, it was too late, and the game was tied.</p>
<h3>The Battle Becomes Fierce and One is Lost for Two</h3>
<p>Feng Yunyou and Chen Gongyu seemed to have a prior agreement, singing in harmony, being very connected. Chen Hongguang's defensive skills were full of offense. The enemy's five forwards almost had the general idea of being on a road full of thorns. Dai Linjing dribbled the ball and broke through the middle line, passing it to Little Jia from afar, rushing forward desperately. Marcel and Pike flew over, and Little Jia had already kicked and swept. Again taking the lead with three to two. But before long, Collett, from 25 yards out, took a sharp kick and shot low. Lu Damen was unprepared, and was unable to block it, and the game was tied again. Before long, Hongguang shot a cold arrow, but it was ineffective. Bauset, along with center forward Ke, and others, besieged Donghua's goal, but could not succeed. Lu Long-legged wanted to save a dangerous ball, and quickly left the fort. Collett drew back and shot, and Chen Gongyu used his hand and foot, and was penalized with a penalty kick. Remidi succeeded with his foot, and the French Businessmen thus won by four to three.</p>

<h3>1933-1934 Men's Basketball Rules Changes</h3>
<p>Announced by the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation</p>
<p>Chapter 1: New Article 4 added, full text as follows:</p>
<p>Extend the diameter line of the center circle, intersecting with the two sidelines, dividing the court into two areas. This line across the center is called the "division line." The line should be marked with a different color. If the court length is less than 75 feet, two parallel lines 40 feet from each end line should be used as the division lines. However, if the court is too small, the extension lines of the two free-throw lines should be used.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 4: Changes to the number of times each player can re-enter the game during each match, full text as follows:</p>
<p>In each match, after a player is substituted out, they may re-enter the game twice, except if they are disqualified due to four personal fouls or a disqualifying foul.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Article 1: A note is added with slight changes (after Article 11 of the old rules) as follows:</p>
<p>The use of a "two-referee" system is very effective. Two people cooperate and each is responsible for supervising the game on one side and one end of the court. In the following articles, the changes all necessitate the application of the "two-referee" system.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Article 14: Changes to the referee's signals, full text as follows: Except for successful throws or free throws, the referee or inspector should blow the whistle to signal various dead balls.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Article 3: A new note is added to reduce jump balls and increase interest in the game, full text as follows:</p>
<p>Many officials often call dead balls too quickly, obstructing the progress of the game, or unfairly depriving players of already gained or about-to-be-gained possession of the ball. In the situation described in the first half of Article 3, a dead ball should not be called immediately. It should only be called when neither side has a complete possibility of gaining possession of the ball and there is no rough play.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Article 9: Rephrased as follows:</p>
<p>When a player holding the ball moves excessively in any direction, it is called "traveling."</p>
<p>(A) When a player is standing still, after receiving the ball, they may jump to pass or pivot. After jumping, the ball must leave their hand before either foot touches the ground, but for pivoting:</p>
<p>(1) If intending to dribble forward, the ball must leave the hand before the pivot foot leaves the ground.</p>
<p>(2) If intending to pass or shoot, the pivot foot may be lifted or the entire body may jump, but the ball must leave the hand before any one foot or both feet land simultaneously.</p>
<p>(B) When a player is running or finishes dribbling and then receives the ball, they may use two steps to come to a stop or throw the ball. The first step is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the player has both feet on the ground when receiving the ball, the moment the ball is caught is the first step.</p>
<p>(2) If the player has both feet off the ground when receiving the ball, the moment after receiving the ball and before either one foot or both feet land simultaneously is the first step.</p>
<p>After the first step, the moment one foot or both feet land simultaneously is counted as the second step.</p>
<p>If the first step is used to stop, then either foot can be used as the pivot foot for pivoting.</p>
<p>If the second step is used to stop, then only the rear foot can be used as the pivot foot for pivoting. If the position of the two feet cannot be distinguished as front and back, then one foot can be lifted, or both feet can jump simultaneously for a shot or pass, but the ball must leave the hand before either one of the lifted feet lands.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Article 22: Added note in brackets, full text as follows:</p>
<p>The half of the court where the team's own basket is located (the larger side when using two division lines) is the team's frontcourt; the other half of the court (the smaller side when using two division lines) is the backcourt.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 5: Remove the words "each period."</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 8 (B): Changes to the full text as follows:</p>
<p>After a team gains possession of the ball in the frontcourt under the four aforementioned circumstances, only the player who first touches the ball, belonging to that team, is allowed to pass it back to the backcourt once. If the ball is touched by a second person (a player from either team), then the team immediately loses the right to pass the ball back to the backcourt and must have the four aforementioned circumstances occur again to regain that right.</p>
<p>Chapter 10, Article 1: After "[Referee's Attention]," add the following sentence: The right to throw in the ball after each out-of-bounds play belongs to the team in the frontcourt area. The referee or inspector should first secure the ball and then continue the game.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, Article 3: Add the following sentence:</p>
<p>If the game is divided into periods, the second and fourth periods should also begin in the same way as described above. If the timer's signal sounds at the end of the first or third period while a shot is in progress and the ball has already left the shooter's hand, then regardless of whether the shot is successful or not, the next period should begin with a jump ball at center court.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, Article 4: A new note is added, full text as follows:</p>
<p>To prevent obstruction of the view during free throws, the referee and inspector should stand in the free-throw lane or behind the backboard.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 12: Changes to the full text as follows:</p>
<p>A player holds the ball in their free-throw lane for more than three seconds.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 12: A new note is added, full text as follows:</p>
<p>Dribbling the ball in the free-throw lane or passing to a teammate also in the lane is considered the same as the above example. But dribbling into the free-throw lane to shoot, passing to a teammate running into the lane to shoot, or the ball being obtained by the opposing team, are not included in this rule.</p>
<p>If a player has one foot in the free-throw lane and has dribbled the ball out of the area, if they dribble back in, they are also subject to the three-second rule. If the time before and after takes more than three seconds, they will immediately lose the right to possession.</p>
<p>If the ball is dribbled out of the free-throw lane and not dribbled back in, the three-second rule does not apply.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 12: In the penalty section, remove the word "side."</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 13: After the penalty section, add a new note, full text as follows:</p>
<p>An offensive player should not be called for a violation of interfering with the ball unless they touch the basket or the basket or its attachments.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 5: Change the words "twice" to "three times."</p>

<h3>Medical Ethics and Medical Rights (Deontology and Diceology)</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Since I wrote the article "The Five Rights of Physicians," Mr. Wang Qizhang has produced a "Supplement" to establish the rights and obligations of physicians from a legal standpoint. The five points he supplements are novel, relevant, and stand out. However, I have some reservations about my humble opinion. I dare to express my views and list them on the left, to be judged by those of high intelligence, which should benefit me.</p>
<p>The ancients said that universal love is benevolence, and proper conduct is righteousness. The words "love" and "proper" are indeed meaningful. Those who alleviate people's difficulties and resolve their disputes are called righteous men in the world and benevolent men in ancient times. How much more so are doctors, who save people from danger and death, relieve their suffering, and restore them to health, not avoiding contagion, not refusing hardship, exposing themselves to wind and frost and chilling their bones when responding to consultations late at night, and exhausting their energy after running around all day, so doctors are born with compassionate hearts and take loving people as their profession. Medicine is a "benevolent art," as the ancients clearly stated. Its foundation is in ethics, which is very clear. However, doctors are one of hundreds of professions. Although wise men are ashamed to talk about the medical profession, "occupational medicine" has become a specialized discipline in foreign countries. Since it is a profession, then sustenance, family support, all depend on it. Therefore, there must be due rights and deserved benefits to maintain integrity and stabilize the profession. Otherwise, if one talks grandly about benevolence and righteousness while going hungry to serve the public, causing the family to suffer from cold and hunger while society praises benevolence and righteousness, no one but those who feign benevolence and adorn righteousness would do this. Generally, there is no one who does not love their own family but can love the masses universally. Love one's relatives first, then the people, and then all things. This has always been the case. The meaning of morality is divided into "for oneself" and "for others," and the two must be taken care of. The definition of rights has a distinction between "proper" and "improper," and the two are absolutely incompatible. If it is deserved, then it is "proper," and there is no conflict with benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, the distribution of medical fees, although harmful to righteousness, is a legitimate income and does not harm benevolence. This is what I have repeatedly emphasized in my humble work on medical ethics. Moreover, "virtue" and "rights" are interdependent and complement each other. If the cultivation of morality is insufficient, then one will do whatever one wants and commit crimes without restraint, and rights will exceed the scope of what is due. If the definition of rights is unclear, then one will be at the mercy of others, and morality will become a great burden to life. Without virtue, there is no way to talk about rights; without rights, there is no way to protect virtue. The relationship between the two is very close. It is not necessarily that those who talk about ethics should not talk about rights. Dong Xi did not refuse rewards, and the world did not consider Confucius greedy. Understanding this, one can know where morality and rights belong.</p>
<h3>Research and Criticism of Kerosene for Treating Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>There is no particularly effective treatment for the suffering of pulmonary tuberculosis, which is the most urgent problem in the medical field today and also the greatest suffering of mankind. As far as we know now, there are chemical therapies, serological therapies, physical therapies, surgical therapies, air and sunlight therapies, dietary therapies, etc. The overall hope and purpose is nothing more than to eliminate tubercle bacilli in the body and restore damaged tissues. However, none of them can fundamentally solve the problem, and none of them can meet the requirements, which is a great regret for our medical community. I once wrote an article three years ago entitled "The Current Trend of Tuberculosis Treatment," which was published in the Xinwen Bao. Readers may still remember it. The essence of the world's treatment of tuberculosis is almost exhausted in this article. However, in fact, some are absolutely ineffective, some are relatively effective, and some are between effective and ineffective. Doctors have no clue. It is a exploratory technique in the research period. However, a group of doctors and pharmacists often focus on one thing and devote themselves to research and development for ten or dozens of years, but they have never achieved the initial harvest. This is because the world has accumulated huge bonuses and the highest reputation, but so far no one can seize or climb to it. It is also a shame for medicine. In recent decades, a group of European and American doctors have shifted their chemical and serological vision to surgical therapy. There are artificial pneumothorax surgery, extrapleural pneumolysis surgery, plombage surgery, thoracoplasty surgery, vagus nerve (diaphragmatic nerve) cutting surgery, phrenicotomic (Phrenicus Ezcehairese), etc. The most negative treatment creation technique is used to prevent the disease from progressing and stopping, and hope that the diseased part can be ended as soon as possible. It is indeed not a treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. It is just a way for patients with lung disease to survive. This is a past event. It is also the most popular and modern treatment method at the moment.</p>
<p>In the past two years, some people in the Japanese medical community suddenly had a whimsical idea and researched kerosene for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Dr. Arao Imamura, director of the Tuberculosis Department of the Medical Department of Osaka Imperial University, my alma mater, is also very interested in this issue and has added research and experiments. Although the overall results have not been made public, sporadic reports are published from time to time. However, Dr. Torakazu Hayami is the vanguard of advocating this treatment method. Although I have not been able to follow in the footsteps of the doctors and actively attack, I have been paying attention at any time without slackening. When I have the opportunity, I occasionally try it. I originally planned to make a contribution to the Chinese people as soon as possible, but I was always too busy and had no time to write, so it was put on hold until now. Unexpectedly, last month, this newspaper, Shen Bao, published an article by Mr. Bingyu called "Proof of Kerosene Treatment for Lung Disease," which aroused a flood of phone calls and letters from a group of lung patients. I had no way to answer them one by one. Now I have no choice but to take a break from my busy schedule and dare to publish it to the public. I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Now, I will start with the description of kerosene as a substance. This product is a natural mineral. When it is taken out of the well, it is mostly mud-like and cannot be used. It must be artificially evaporated and purified before it can be used as fuel. However, this type of oil contains many substances with different evaporation points, such as Vaselin, which has a high evaporation point, and Beuzin, which has a low evaporation point. The quality of kerosene varies depending on the height of the evaporation point and the impurities it contains. Therefore, the so-called kerosene produced in various countries and regions and the refining methods are different, and the products are different. Generally speaking, kerosene is chemically called Petroleum, Steinoloder Eedol, which is nothing more than chain saturated hydrocarbons (C2hH2n＋2) and cyclic saturated hydrocarbons (CnH2n). The kerosene produced in the United States is mostly composed of chain saturated hydrocarbons, such as NonaneCoH2oDekaueCroH22. However, it also contains a small amount of cyclic saturated hydrocarbons, such as CymolC6H4CH3C3P7, etc. If the kerosene produced in Russia, it is rich in cyclic saturated hydrocarbons. Its content accounts for more than 80%. In addition, it also contains OlefineCnH2n, TerpeneNaphteneacid, and other organic acids, such as kerosene acid, carbonic acid, asphalt, and other similar substances, as well as hydrogen sulfide-containing organic compounds, etc.</p>
<p>The composition of kerosene is as complicated as described above, and it is by no means a simple compound. Therefore, multiple components can be distilled by using the temperature distillation method, such as Cymcgen Ligroini5ooC, Petroleumether3ooC, Gasoline79oioooC, petroleumBenzin120|150oC, etc. The kerosene used for lighting that we now take is Kerosine; Leuchtpetroleum, which boils between 150|300oC. This is the general situation of kerosene in chemistry.</p>
<p>Chemical products of smoke oil, such as rolling paraffin ParafffinumLiquidum and Vaseline VzsolinumIerFene, are all products commonly needed by our medical community. However, they are all for external use. If it is lamp kerosene, in addition to being used for disinfection and washing or skin diseases, the taste is unbearable and the quality is too mixed. There have been very few internal users since ancient times. However, in European prescriptions, three to five drops to ten drops are always put into capsules as drugs for suppressing spasm and driving away insects. Recently, it has also been used for gastric fermentation, chronic enteritis, etc. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, I tried to use it for cholera and dysentery patients. Most of the former vomited it out, and there was no effect to remember. The latter was able to shorten the course of the disease and was able to achieve rapid results in the shortest time. However, due to the limited number of patients at that time, I could not test it on a large number of patients, which was a pity. (When I was working at the railway, I used to mix kerosene cucumber with rattan charcoal and give it to patients for internal use, which was extremely effective.) The use of kerosene to treat pulmonary tuberculosis has been a hot topic in neighboring Japan in the past two years. Almost all medical universities and tuberculosis treatment institutions have experimented with all their heart. The Takeo Tuberculosis Research Institute in Osaka is also one of the research centers, but it has not yet reached the success period. I serve the society and travel between public and private affairs. I lack experimental materials and research opportunities. Every day, I only encourage voluntary patients to try it. Although there are no statistics to speak of, there are several things worth recording. First, those who dare to try it are mostly patients who have been sick for a long time and are bedridden, or patients with terminal tuberculosis who are in unbearable pain. It is within expectations that there is no good result. Second, although internal use of kerosene is not toxic, its taste is bad and unfavorable to the stomach. Patients often vomit after taking it. Therefore, patients without determination often cannot try it again, especially those with nervous constitutions. Third, it is safer to take a small amount for a long time. If you drink too much in a hurry, it can often cause gastrointestinal diseases. In patients with severe coughs, it is more likely to cause nausea and vomiting. Fourth, patients with heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, gastrointestinal inflammation, gastric ulcer, beriberi, and anemia are not suitable for taking it. It is more harmful than beneficial after taking it. Fifth, there is no effect on laryngeal tuberculosis, kidney tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, and bone tuberculosis that has rotted, and third-stage cavitary tuberculosis. It is better not to try it.</p>
<p>In recent Japanese medical journals, there are also reports on this issue published from time to time. However, ordinary publications such as "Housewife's Friend" often have reporters who are not experts and pick up one or two things, which inevitably have the suspicion of being too exaggerated. For example, patients who cough due to laryngotracheitis caused by excessive smoking, after taking 30 grams, not only stopped coughing and greatly improved their appetite, but also their stomach disease and kidney disease were completely cured once. It is completely inconsistent with the original purpose of taking kerosene to treat pulmonary tuberculosis. I originally planned to record and translate this type of text and add criticism. However, the material is too long, and Dr. Ding Huikang has already excerpted and translated it in the previous issue of this journal, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>According to kerosene, it is one of the fatty substances. Ordinary small bodies cannot be supplied with fat for their lives, but it does not have to be toxic to them. If we place small living bodies in fat, we will soon see them die. The cause of their death is due to blocking the air they need or cutting off their nutrients. It is not that fat has the power to kill. However, various natural fatty substances often contain other organic substances. These substances often have special functions. Therefore, I think that kerosene itself may not have the ability to kill bacteria and cure diseases. What is possible is only the organic substances outside the fat itself. According to research, kerosene contains kerosene acid, carbonic acid, TerpeneNuphteneacid, and other similar substances. As far as we know, turpentine OleumIerpinthein can treat tracheal diseases, while carbonic acid and Naphthalin have disinfecting and bactericidal effects. However, to this day, in internal use, we are always too concerned about damaging body tissue cells and use less or dare not use them. The ordinary lamp coal contained in ■ may still have other things. How many types are there? How many points? I have no time to investigate, or there are no previous reports. I will not discuss it for the time being. According to what I know, those who die from taking lamp coal ■, except for a large amount or special circumstances in the body, generally do not die. I think that there should be no worries about the damage to body tissue cells. So far, we can base on internal medicine. It is non-toxic or weakly toxic to body cells and toxic or highly toxic to pathogens. It is okay to try it. As for the amount of internal service, I advocate small amount and long service, but it should not be too small, resulting in a drop to the effective amount. Usually, take ten grams as a standard every day and take it several times. When taking it, you can put it into a capsule, which is easier to swallow. It is better to have a full stomach and easy to vomit. It is better on an empty stomach, but you cannot fail to see the strength of your personal physique and use it flexibly. (If you are weak, you may take it every other day or several days.)</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Finally, I still have something to say. The main purpose of today's treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is to kill the tubercle bacilli that cause the disease and to restore the destroyed lung tissue. What is the purpose of applying kerosene? Is it all useful? According to my observation and the reports of various experimenters, refined kerosene or benzene-like products have no effect. From this point of view, its attention seems not to be on the fat itself, but on the organic impurities it contains. It is conceivable that most of the impurities known today are mainly for disinfection and sterilization. Therefore, its effect seems to be in the former and not in the latter. However, does the fatty substance of kerosene still contain substances similar to vitamins in cod liver oil as an aid? I dare not know in advance. Today, we can only hope to kill the tubercle bacilli that cause the disease and wait for its natural recovery or add other drugs to supplement it. However, those with severe tissue destruction and defects may not be able to restore their original appearance. This is why lung disease must be treated early. Can the effect of kerosene in treating lung disease escape this scope? (I apologize to you all for not being able to reply in detail.)</p>
<h3>Discussion of Pediatric Diseases</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongken</p>
<p>As a doctor, regardless of Chinese or foreign medicine, one should seek the location of the disease and treat it accordingly. It is definitely not possible to prescribe a prescription based on one's own memory and fallacy. However, some old doctors in our country do the opposite, which is very dangerous. Now I will give an example to solicit public opinion. A few days ago, I went to the home of a Mr. He on Beijing Road to diagnose a baby who was less than two months old. At that time, his limbs were purple, swollen to the abdomen, and his face was also purple. Although there was still breath, he was dying. He could not eat milk. Upon examination, his limbs were cold to the elbows and knees, his pulse was only slightly faint, and only a clear murmur was heard in the heart area. The breathing sound was continuously irregular and there was no bubbling sound. After careful inquiry, I learned that he had been ill for more than a week. At first, only his limbs and mouth were purple when he was angry and crying. It was difficult for him to drink milk. The neighbor pointed to the white hard nodules on his upper and lower jaws as "Spanish" that hindered milk drinking. So she summoned an old-fashioned female doctor to treat him. The doctor said that he had become frightened due to tooth poison, so she took off his clothes and repeatedly massaged him upside down, and the purple and red became even worse. His limbs gradually became swollen. Then she changed to a certain Dr. Lu to diagnose him. In total, she used calamus, Tianzhuhuang, Plantain, and thick bark, etc. for five doses in three days to promote water and calm the nerves. (No medical record is listed) He had urinated as many as nine times in one day, but his symptoms still did not diminish. Then he changed to a certain pediatrician for diagnosis and treatment. There were three times in total. Now I will record his medical records as follows. (1) A baby more than a month old has a slight cough and choking, cries without tears, his limbs are not warm, and his skin is purple. There is a lot of phlegm inside, blocking the lungs. The lung qi is blocked. The symptoms are dangerous and changes should be prevented. (2) After taking the medicine yesterday, the crying sound was slightly smoother, there were very few tears and tears, the skin was purple, and the limbs were still not warm. There is still a lot of phlegm, blocking the lungs. Although the symptoms have decreased, prevent changes again. (3) He still cries without tears, his skin is purple all over, he is restless, and his urination is blocked. The bladder is not working. Phlegm is blocking the lungs and stomach. The symptoms are dangerous and it is feared that it will be difficult to save. (His prescription is a clearing lung, calming the nerves, and promoting drainage agent, which is omitted) When his family summoned me to see him, the situation was as described above, dying and unable to save him, and unable to do anything. In the evening, I heard bad news. When the child was one week old after birth, he had summoned me to see him because he cried a lot and his mouth and face were purple and his limbs were swollen. At that time, I diagnosed that his heart, right ventricle was enlarged, and there was a systolic murmur at the pulmonary artery opening, and the second sound was weak. It was the so-called congenital pulmonary artery stenosis and occlusion. So I gave him cardiac and diuretic agents, and he recovered in three days. This time, I think the disaster was caused by the massage doctor turning him upside down too much and moving his body too violently, which his heart could not bear. However, the doctors did not seek the root cause and called a deer a horse. Without hearing the symptoms of cough and wheezing, they determined that it was phlegm blocking the lungs, which is sighable. According to the blood circulation, the heart is in charge. Urinary excretion is in charge of the kidneys. The lungs control breathing, and the nose and trachea belong to them. This is the common physiological knowledge that everyone knows. If there is a cough, wheezing, and a lot of phlegm, it is a symptom of the lungs and trachea. Now, according to the past medical records and the current symptoms, there is no cough or wheezing. How can it be said that phlegm is blocking the lungs? The current symptoms of systemic edema and purple discoloration are caused by poor blood circulation. How can it be forced to be a lung symptom? It is very obvious that he does not understand the symptoms. Judging from his prescription, the result can be imagined. However, Chinese people often have fixed opinions and call each other by the quintessence of the country. Those who are parents also admire the reputation of the times. Similar examples are definitely not limited to this.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Question and Answer on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(26) Scarlet fever</p>
<p>(Q) What was scarlet fever called in our country in the old days?</p>
<p>(A) Scarlet fever was called rotten throat rash or simply red rash in our country in the old days.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the Western medical name for scarlet fever?</p>
<p>(A) The Latin word is Scarlatina, the German word is Scharlach, and the English word is Scarletfever, all of which mean scarlet, because the skin rash of this disease is a patchy scarlet rash.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the pathogen of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Recently, it is generally believed that the pathogen of this disease is hemolytic streptococcus.</p>
<p>(Q) How is it transmitted?</p>
<p>(A) It is transmitted from the clothes and utensils used by patients. Because the pathogen of scarlet fever is very resistant, even after more than a month, it still has the power to transmit. If healthy people inhale this pathogen into the pharynx, or through skin wounds, or from the genitals of postpartum women, they will all be infected with this disease.</p>
<p>(Q) At what age is scarlet fever most likely to occur?</p>
<p>(A) Children aged two to ten are most susceptible to infection; older people are less likely.</p>
<p>(Q) At what season is it most likely to occur?</p>
<p>(A) It occurs most often in autumn. After contracting the disease once, most people acquire immunity.</p>
<p>(Q) How many stages can the course of scarlet fever be divided into?</p>
<p>(A) It can be divided into four stages: incubation, prodromal, rash, and recovery.</p>
<p>(Q) How many days does the incubation period last?</p>
<p>(A) The incubation period is about three to six days.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prodromal period like?</p>
<p>(A) The prodromal period begins with chills and sudden rise in body temperature; soon, headache and difficulty swallowing appear. At the same time, the tonsils and soft palate become swollen.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the rash period like?</p>
<p>(A) On the first and second days of the disease, there is a unique rash on the neck, upper chest, armpits, etc. On the third and fourth days, it reaches its extreme and gradually appears on the trunk and limbs; however, it is less common on the face and head. Especially the area around the chin and lips does not occur? This part is relatively pale.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the rash like?</p>
<p>(A) The rash is about the size of a hatpin head; it is initially light red, and healthy skin can still be seen between each rash; then it becomes generalized and scarlet. The rash part is slightly raised and fades when pressed.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the situation of body temperature during this period?</p>
<p>(A) The body temperature that has already risen in the prodromal period rises even more during the rash period; then it drops with the fading of the rash; and returns to normal temperature on the ninth day after the onset of the disease. The redness and swelling of the tonsils, pharynx, soft palate, uvula, etc. are further increased during this period. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>After the Draft [Regulations on Consultation Fees of the Shanghai Medical Association] (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Now we need to discuss whether the regulations are the minimum rate standard. Of course, it is impossible to write out all the items listed in the draft due to the limited space in this publication. Even I have not studied every item in detail. But in general, there is no inconsistency between the rights of the doctor himself and the level of local life. Several items that ordinary people pay most attention to, such as one yuan for outpatient consultation, five yuan for home consultation, double for emergency consultation, and one and a half times for night consultation; as long as you have had contact with a doctor, you will probably not think it is high. Ordinary surgeries, such as eight yuan for spinal puncture, twelve yuan for knee puncture, eight yuan for ascites puncture, ten yuan for chest puncture, and three yuan for abscess incision, etc.; the prices are very low. Among them, I think it is not easy to achieve the purpose of a knee puncture. This level of material reward seems to be too meager! In addition, the draft lists the highest fee for major surgery as 240 yuan, and the most surprising cesarean section is 100 yuan to 300 yuan; this highest price is certainly not a lot. I think the surgical fees that patients know or experience and exceed this highest number are probably not few.</p>
<p>This standard draft is certainly not a problem for the bourgeoisie. Of course, it is very difficult for the poor class; but this is a problem for the whole society. We should use all our strength to set up more civilian hospitals for relief. It is definitely not something that individual doctors or individual groups can do. What about the middle class? I think it is worth discussing. Because there are many people in this class in society, and the situations are relatively uneven. This draft regulation also targets this group of people. According to my personal intuitive analysis, this class probably has the following three categories: 1. Those with assets of more than 10,000 and less than 100,000; 2. Those with specialized knowledge or skills and a monthly income of more than 150 yuan to 500 or 600 yuan; 3. Those without specialized knowledge but with relatively good fixed jobs and a monthly income of 50 yuan to 200 yuan. (Old-fashioned store employees, with a monthly income of 20 yuan to 50 yuan, can also be included in this category). The first category belongs to the petty bourgeoisie, and this low amount of responsibility is certainly not a problem. The second category has a richer income, and I don’t think there will be a problem. Just try to save as much as possible on unnecessary waste, include medical expenses in the annual budget; at the same time, pay attention to seeking more doctors when you are sick and pay attention to the expenses outside of medical expenses when you are sick! The most problematic thing is of course those who earn less than 100 gold a month and have family burdens. Because these people have low incomes, some are unable to seek medical treatment due to long-term illness, and some have to borrow or pawn due to their inability to pay medical expenses. Of course, it cannot be said that such facts do not exist, but I think that patients on the one hand are used to several bad habits that have been passed down to this day, and very few people can avoid them regardless of whether they have money or not. First, the floating expenses outside of proper medical treatment are too huge. In addition to new and old doctors, like magic prescriptions, folk prescriptions, praying to gods, and making vows, as long as someone says it’s good, they will always try it. I remember last year that I diagnosed a child with diphtheria. When I went to diagnose him, he had been sick for five days. At that time, the symptoms were very dangerous. As a result, he continued to inject serum three times and recovered. Later, I heard that the family spent several hundred yuan this time, and the one item of kowtowing and making vows in all directions on the most serious day exceeded 100 yuan; and what I got, including the serum, was only forty or fifty yuan. If there had been proper treatment two days earlier, I don't think this amount would be needed. A disease that can be cured with thirty or forty yuan results in such a huge result, so who is to blame? Second, the ability to choose a doctor is too weak. A says Zhang is good, then Zhang is good. B says Li is good, then Li is good. Ordinary diseases that can be treated in a short period of time sometimes end up being bedridden for months without being cured. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Experiment of Curing Lung Disease with Kerosene (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Since the publication of this article, we have received earnest inquiries from concerned members of society. We hereby provide a simple answer in lieu of individual letters. (1) The original article was published in a Japanese magazine. However, academics know no borders, and discussions can be open to the public. Therefore, we are publicly reporting the evidence and experiments of various Japanese experts to promote academic inquiry and clarification, affirming what is correct and rejecting what is not. This is not intended to completely overturn all existing rational medical methods and solely rely on kerosene treatment. (2) Currently, over ten patients are being treated with kerosene at the Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium, including those with peritoneal tuberculosis, intestinal tuberculosis, spinal tuberculosis, cavitary tuberculosis, and early-stage apical infiltration. The results of these experiments will be published in this journal in the future to inform concerned readers. If medical colleagues encounter tuberculosis patients who are considering kerosene treatment, they may also be sent to our hospital to obtain more clinical experimental reports on kerosene treatment, which I believe you would be interested in hearing.</p>
<p>(II) The Effectiveness of Kerosene Therapy for Lung Disease is Imminent (Viewing Kerosene as Toxic is Due to Insufficient Understanding) According to a discussion with Dr. Yoshitora Iwamoto, a Doctor of Science at the Osaka Municipal Industrial Research Institute: I have been engaged in oil research for over ten years, so I immediately believed it when I heard that kerosene could cure lung disease.</p>
<p>Most people seem to view kerosene as toxic, which is a great mistake. This error stems from a lack of understanding of kerosene.</p>
<p>Kerosene is extracted from hundreds of feet below the ground. How kerosene is produced at this depth is currently uncertain, but most believe in the [animal origin theory].</p>
<p>It is said that the corpses of ancient fish and plankton decompose, their proteins and carbohydrates disappear, and fats decompose into fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are insoluble in water, so they accumulate in one place and then decompose again to form kerosene. Numerous experiments can prove this. In Japan, the analysis of oil and saltwater, the decomposition of fish oil, or the proof that kerosene contains the same fatty acids as fish oil, and the crude oil in the Echigo and Hokkaido regions of Japan are also believed to originate from ancient fish buried underground. Now, kerosene can be produced from soybean oil and fish oil. I once separated four and a half quarts of kerosene from one liter of fish oil. In fact, kerosene is inherently present in the animal and vegetable oils we eat daily, so it is not surprising to use kerosene as a drink.</p>
<p>In Siberia, people in cold regions often drink kerosene. Medicinally, (Benzine) can be used for wound disinfection and washing, as well as to eliminate scabies mites and lice. Oral administration can treat abnormal gastric fermentation and can be used as a treatment for chronic intestinal catarrh, with a daily dose of 0.3 to 0.9 watts, taken in capsules, as found in medical books.</p>
<p>The well-known kerosene emulsion is a powerful bactericide and insecticide. This is made by adding an emulsifier to kerosene and stirring, which turns the kerosene into extremely fine particles that can kill insects without harming plants.</p>
<p>From this, if kerosene is harmless to the human body, then after drinking it, the strong bactericides contained in the kerosene will be absorbed by the body's tissues, circulate throughout the body, reach the affected area, and exert their bactericidal effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the foods we eat daily contain fats and salts, which are transformed into a soap-like form in the stomach and intestines through subtle physiological processes. Its strong emulsifying properties turn difficult-to-absorb nutrients into emulsions, making them easily absorbed from the intestinal walls.</p>
<p>Therefore, after drinking kerosene, it is easy to imagine that not only is kerosene rich in penetrating power, but it can also partially emulsify. The emulsified kerosene can be absorbed into the blood from the intestines of the digestive system, circulate throughout the body. Kerosene can be found in the urine after drinking kerosene, and kerosene can also seep out of the skin, which is evidence of this.</p>
<p>From these facts, it can be inferred that kerosene, in its original state or in a slightly altered state (such as emulsified), flows into the lungs and, together with breathing, acts on the tuberculosis bacteria in the affected area, causing them to die.</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, I once drank 100 watts of kerosene continuously and fully confirmed its harmlessness. Then, I told several of my friends who suffered from lung disease about my belief, and they immediately agreed to try it voluntarily. All had good results and were amazed by its significant effect. Therefore, I further publicized this fact to my acquaintances. By chance, a news reporter interviewed and published it in the newspaper. In the past year, I have received as many as three or four thousand letters directly inquiring about the method of drinking and other matters, most of whom were suffering from lung disease, and over half of them were said to be in the near-terminal stages of the third stage.</p>
<p>At that time, I was unable to reply to each one individually, so I used a mimeograph to replace the reply letter. The scope of drinking kerosene has expanded to Manchuria, Taiwan, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, etc., almost covering the entire Japan. Among them, the most were in the Kyushu area and Nagoya, followed by Ehime and the Kinki Mie areas. According to the letters of thanks from these drinkers, many were amazed by its miraculous effects. Unfortunately, the letter writers were all those who had good results, and the other half with poor results could not be known because no reports were received.</p>
<p>A few months ago, a doctor raised a serious protest to me, saying, [Kerosene is harmful to the human body. Drinking this substance for weak lung disease patients is harmful and not beneficial. Moreover, you are not a doctor and you are persuading people to take this, which violates the doctor's law promulgated by the government.]</p>
<p>I replied, [The advantage and disadvantage of drinking kerosene lies in the amount. Whether it is morphine or aspirin, too much can be fatal. Compared with the poisons used by these doctors, kerosene is not a poison and is hundreds of times safer. It is safer than alcohol. As for the doctor's law, I don’t know, but as for kerosene, I know that there is no hindrance to drinking a certain amount. There are facts to prove it from an academic point of view or from an experimental point of view, and I know that it is effective for lung diseases. Of course, someone will ask me for advice, and it is immoral to keep it secret, so I tell them the precautions for drinking. If you say that this violates the national law, please teach me where it is not allowed.] The doctor never wrote back. It is regrettable that there are many doctors who do not know much about kerosene.</p>
<p>If kerosene has a special effect on lung disease, is the whole kerosene effective, or only the special ingredients it contains? It is an interesting question. I am currently separating the special ingredients in kerosene for clinical experiments by medical experts, and I think there will be detailed publications in the future.</p>
<p>As for the method of drinking, according to my experience, the first time you can drink 5 watts, and then drink it again in three or four days. First, try drinking once or twice to see if there are any reactions such as diarrhea, vomiting, headache, and fever. If there are no such abnormalities, you can increase it by one or two watts and still drink it once every three or four days. It is best to drink it on an empty stomach before going to bed.</p>
<p>The maximum amount is 20 watts for early-stage patients, 15 watts for second-stage patients, and 7-8 watts for patients with hemoptysis or third-stage patients.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to this amount and the interval between drinking, you will never lose it. A small amount of Chinese medicine rhubarb can be used as a stomachic, and a large amount can be used as a laxative. Kerosene also has the same properties. After drinking it for the first one or two times, there may be mild diarrhea and soft stools, but after that, it is extremely refreshing, and the body temperature may increase slightly, but it is only a temporary phenomenon and is not worth worrying about. Drinking it will definitely increase appetite and refresh the mind and body, and it will not hinder the use of other medicines at the same time.</p>
<p>As for the type of kerosene, all ordinary lamp oils are good, but it is best to use those that are slightly yellow and mixed with 0.4% of impurities. The best ones seem not to be good.</p>

<h3>Countermeasures for the Silver Problem</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>The Eight-Nation Silver Agreement is a strategy used by gold countries to suppress silver countries. According to the agreement, there are restrictions on the sale of silver coins, restrictions on pound coins, and restrictions on the silver content of silver coins in gold countries. Only then can the excess of silver be avoided, the price drop of silver be avoided, and the export trade of gold countries to silver countries can be developed. The United States' increase in silver prices is also a strategy to suppress silver countries. If this strategy is successful, the exchange rate of silver countries will fall, export trade will be boosted, and silver countries will become the tail ends of their surplus goods. These two methods have different means, but they have the power to raise silver prices and suppress the agricultural, industrial, and commercial forces of silver countries, which is no different.</p>
<p>Our country is a silver country. Since the price of gold has risen and the price of silver has fallen, export trade has been somewhat positively affected, and import trade has been somewhat hindered. In the past two or three years, although the trade deficit has become more prosperous, the depreciation of silver prices has created a small barrier in the exchange rate, which has invisibly recovered a lot. Now that the Eight-Nation Agreement is insufficient, the United States wants to raise silver prices, and the only barrier in the exchange rate will be broken. From now on, from foreign trade to the national economy, it will be more and more suppressed. From other aspects, although there are some benefits, the harm outweighs the benefits. Mr. Ma Yinchu has repeatedly argued that people either think that his words are too extreme, or that he sees the harm but does not see the benefits. I think it is in line with common sense and is concise.</p>
<p>But must the exchange rate of our country be subject to its regular control when silver prices rise? Are all the countermeasures that our country has on the silver problem as difficult as Mr. Ma and the banking industry say? I am afraid that it is not so simple. Examine the market price of gold and silver and the external exchange rate of gold currency countries and silver currency countries. There are those that are closely related, and there are those that are completely unrelated. When the purity of its standard currency is exactly the same as the nominal price and Zhengjin can flow freely, they are closely related. At this time, manipulating the market price of gold and silver is manipulating the exchange rate between gold countries and silver countries. The external exchange rate of the United States before it stopped the gold standard is an example. If the flow of Zhengjin loses its freedom, then no matter how pure its standard currency is, the external exchange rate of the currency will not be enough to represent the market price of gold and silver, or the ratio of exchange rates and the price of gold and silver may be completely unrelated. By now, manipulating the market price of gold and silver is a problem, and manipulating the exchange rate between gold countries and silver countries is another problem. The rise and fall of the exchange rate and the price of gold and silver do not have to be the same. The external exchange rate of the United States after it stopped the gold standard is another example. Our country is a silver country. If the import and export of raw silver are left to their own devices, then the price of silver and the exchange rate should follow each other closely. If the price of silver rises, the exchange rate will inevitably be subject to its normal control, resulting in various malpractices. However, if our country manages to restrict the import and export of raw silver, then even if the price of silver can rise, our country's external exchange rate may not rise with it. If the exchange rate does not rise, then the barrier to prevent trade aggression is still there, and it can be strengthened. Even if the United States raises the price of silver every day, how can it make its exchange rate against China fall to boost its export trade to China? Even if we push it to other gold currency countries, how can they use their currency to manipulate our country's external exchange rate for the market price of raw silver?</p>
<p>The so-called restriction on the import and export of raw silver, in this trend of increasing silver prices, is actually restricting its export. There are two ways to restrict exports: one is to prohibit exports, and the other is to levy export taxes, and the latter is more effective than the former. Therefore, it is best to prohibit the free export of raw silver, and no one may export silver except the central bank. In this way, the purchase and sale of foreign exchange bills can still be open, and the external exchange rate of our country's silver currency can be manipulated by our country's central bank. Internally, of course, hard currency silver coins are still the standard currency, but externally, it is tantamount to stopping the use of silver and using paper currency as the standard. Its role in international trade is the same as that of the United Kingdom and the United States in stopping the gold standard. Last year, the United States stopped the gold standard, and its intention was to depreciate its external exchange rate to develop its export trade, and to avoid its external exchange rate from being subject to the regular control of the market price of raw gold, so as to compete with the export trade of countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan.</p>
<p>If silver exports are prohibited, the difference between exchange bills and the market price of raw silver will be greater, the trend of private smuggling will be more intense, and the effect of manipulating the exchange rate will be reduced because of this. This is what Mr. Ma is deeply worried about. But there are many people in the world who prohibit the free export of Zhengjin, and there are also many people who distance themselves from the market price of gold exchange bills. Are there no private smugglers in other countries? Have you ever seen them open the ban because private smuggling cannot be eradicated? Prevention and investigation are police problems, not currency and exchange rate problems.</p>
<p>If silver exports are prohibited, the difference in exchange bills will not be able to be adjusted, and huge trade deficits will not be able to be settled. This is what the banking industry is deeply worried about. How can we know that the purpose of prohibiting silver exports is to form an inverse exchange rate to hinder import trade, and if the deficit settlement is inconvenient, then it can be inconvenient. Although raw silver cannot be freely exported, the central bank's export rights are clearly there. If it wants to adjust the promotion, it is not worried about having no technique. Why worry that the large amount of silver deposited in foreign banks will not be able to prohibit its export?</p>
<p>Since the effectiveness and possibility of prohibiting silver exports are as above, the current outflow due to the increase in silver prices may not become an urgent problem. Levying silver taxes, such as seeking revenue for customs duties or seeking convenience for financial industry exchange rate cases, is another issue. If it is used as a countermeasure to the silver problem, it is not as comprehensive as prohibiting silver exports.</p>
<p>What is worrying is that if silver exports are prohibited, various countries can invest in our country with the gains from trade, or absorb cash silver to store in foreign banks in China. Then, the trade deficit will not be prevented by exchange rate barriers. Mr. Ma is also worried about the cunning tricks of foreign businessmen, which are indeed difficult to deal with. However, this kind of strategy can be done when the price of silver rises, and it can also be done when the price of silver falls. If the economic capabilities of various countries recover, they will definitely come up with this trick sooner or later, so there is no need to talk about the problem of rising silver prices.</p>
<h3>On the U.S. Silver Policy from the Perspective of the International Currency War</h3>
<p>— Bingju</p>
<p>As soon as the U.S.'s call to raise silver prices and buy silver was heard, the Chinese financial community on this side of the Pacific showed great excitement. Before careful research, general experts and scholars echoed and hyped it up. Saying that it is nervous would be a bit insulting, but saying that it is making waves should not be too excessive!</p>
<p>Whether the United States will pass the silver legislation is not something that a telegram from the Chinese banking community can solve. The development of the problem does not lie in China's opposition or approval. On the contrary, whether the United States can pass the silver bill completely depends on its own needs. When it needs to buy silver for further currency inflation, it will buy it. When it does not need to buy silver, even if the bill is passed, it may still not buy it. So we better not start firing cannons just because there is a bit of wind over there. It is more stable to carefully review the other party's difficulties from the standpoint of [knowing yourself and knowing the enemy].</p>
<p>First, we should know that the U.S.'s purchase of silver is only used to supplement the lack of gold purchases in its role, and it does not mean that the U.S. must adopt Bimetallism or change to silver standard once it purchases silver. Whether it is buying gold or buying silver, the main purpose is nothing more than to inflate the currency.</p>
<p>Second, when it comes to currency inflation, there is one point that we should pay special attention to. According to the current official-style telegrams, it seems that the expansion of freight is specifically for the purpose of raising domestic prices, and especially the prices of agricultural products. In fact, the facts will never be that simple. Currency inflation, in its essence, contains two meanings: one is to raise domestic prices, and the other is to lower external exchange rates. From the current economic situation in the United States, it is more important to say that buying gold and buying silver is to lower external exchange rates than to raise domestic prices. Why? | - This has to be explained from another aspect.</p>
<p>Third, since the United States implemented currency inflation in March last year, all economic conditions have not improved except for a slight increase in the production index between June and July. Not only are the people complaining, but also the ruling leaders cannot avoid being uneasy in their hearts. Although they are uneasy, they cannot rein in at the last moment for a while. (Because if the expansion policy is stopped immediately, the artificial purchasing power will become even more tragic.) Continue to expand? Or stabilize the currency? | - These two opposing things have put the U.S. government in a dilemma. In this case, they have no choice but to deal with both sides. On the one hand, they explicitly reduced the currency value to 59.06 cents to show the intention of stabilization; on the other hand, they massively purchased gold (of course, buying silver is also necessary) to prepare for further currency inflation.</p>
<p>On the surface, this seems unreasonable (why stabilize and expand at the same time? Isn't this contradictory?), but in fact, it is very reasonable.</p>
<p>The United States cannot rashly stabilize the currency now. Because if she stabilizes the currency and the UK and Japan continue to use the expansion policy to continue to fall in foreign exchange, she will immediately suffer. In this situation, she must take a wait-and-see approach. She first stabilizes at the currency value of 0.5906, and then sees how the international situation develops. If she can stand firm at the level of 0.5906, then she will temporarily hold back her troops; if the international situation is unfavorable to her above this level, she may as well fall further. Roosevelt has the right to drop the currency value to 50 percent, and that is the intention.</p>
<p>From the perspective of falling foreign exchange and reducing currency value, the facts are so obvious, so why buy gold and buy silver? | - This touches on the root of the new U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>Since the United States abandoned the gold standard, gold treasury bonds have flooded the market (buying gold does not mean minting it into gold coins and circulating it in the market, and the result is only concentrating gold in the government.) Now, if they buy silver, they can also issue silver treasury bonds in the future. The purpose of issuing silver treasury bonds is ostensibly to finance rural funds, but in essence, it is to prepare for further currency inflation. That is to say, if the gold dollar value falls to 50 percent and is still in an unfavorable position in terms of foreign exchange, the U.S. government can use the silver treasury bonds to inflate the currency again. In relative (i.e., external) terms, this is tantamount to lowering the external exchange rate again.</p>
<p>From buying gold to buying silver, it is completely permeated with [preparing to inflate the currency]. And [preparing to inflate the currency] means that, rather than raising domestic prices, it is to cope with the international exchange war, the international currency war, | - Here we have answered the second question.</p>
<p>When we see through the U.S. silver policy from the perspective of the international currency war is nothing more than (1) assisting gold, (2) falling in foreign exchange, and (3) preparing to inflate the currency again, then should we still fear the U.S. silver policy?</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will still be afraid. However, as long as we recognize that (1) whether the United States buys silver depends on the international currency war (it does not depend on whether the silver bill is passed or not), (2) the United States now wants to stabilize the currency but does not dare to let go (it will eventually stabilize the currency. Even if it buys all of China's silver, it will eventually have to throw it out in the future), then this problem can always be solved peacefully and satisfactorily!</p>
<h3>New Developments in American Securities Control</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>I previously wrote an article discussing the securities market control policies of the United States (see Issue 59 of this publication). However, the discussion was limited to the Federal Securities Act enacted in May 1933, and focused mainly on factual introductions, without delving into its merits or demerits, which I regret. Moreover, economic phenomena are like a rushing river, constantly changing. Existing policies may no longer be suitable for the subsequent environment, necessitating changes and new developments. The same applies to the American securities control policy. Therefore, I will introduce the new Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to the readers and attempt a brief critique of the securities market control policy.</p>
<p>What is the so-called new control policy? It is the Securities Exchange Act. The purpose of this Act can be gleaned from President Roosevelt's memorandum to Congress. A passage in the memorandum reads:</p>
<p>[Exchanges are established to facilitate the trading of securities and commodities, and they are indispensable to the national economy. However, for the sake of the future of the entire country, we must urgently prevent exchanges from focusing solely on speculative business. Therefore, in order to protect investors and stabilize the prices of securities and commodities, we should eliminate all superfluous and harmful speculative activities, and the federal government should enact new laws to control the securities and commodity trading business.] (Excerpt from Magazine of Wall Street, 15 Feb, 34)</p>
<p>Comparing the Securities Act of last year with the Securities Act of this year (hereinafter referred to as the Old Act and the New Act), we can discover their respective characteristics. The purpose of the Old Act was mainly to curb the improper issuance of corporate bonds and stocks, while the New Act aims to curb speculation in the trading of already issued securities. In other words, the Old Act curbed the issuance of securities before it happened, while the New Act goes a step further to curb (or control) already issued securities. The former strikes at the head, the latter sweeps the tail, attacking from both ends and complementing each other to achieve the completion of securities control. Ultimately, both aim to protect the well-intentioned investing public, and we will have thought over half of the matter if we observe it in this way.</p>
<p>(2) Content of the New Act</p>
<p>The New Act was promulgated in late February, with a total of 21 articles. Major magazines and newspapers across the United States raced to report it. However, in our country, only fragmented pieces are seen in newspapers, lacking both a system and completeness. Now, I will use the simplest and most concise language to outline the essence and key points as follows, so as to provide a reference for domestic scholars studying American securities law.</p>
<p>(1) Those participating in clearing transactions shall, in principle, pay a margin of 60% of the price of the securities bought and sold. (Note: the Old Act was 50% to 30%). (2) The Federal Trade Commission has the power to curb short selling and all other transactions harmful to the public interest. (3) Those who violate this Act shall be fined up to $25,000 or imprisoned for up to ten years. (4) Those who suffer losses due to buying or selling securities deemed illegal under the New Act may sue the other party for compensation for losses. (5) All acceptance of customer securities for the purpose of short selling is prohibited. (6) Members or brokers of securities exchanges shall not borrow money from banks not affiliated with the Federal Reserve System using their own securities as collateral. (7) The borrowings and customer deposits of members or brokers of securities exchanges (note: these two items constitute their liabilities) shall not exceed ten times their business assets. (8) Securities entrusted by customers shall not be thrown into the market without their consent, regardless of the purpose. (9) Manipulation of securities prices, such as so-called matched sales, combined sales, and other artificial methods of changing market prices, as well as deliberately spreading rumors and confusing hearsay, are prohibited. (10) If members of the exchange need to buy or sell short, they should first state the reasons to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>(11) All cornering of the market (foresfalling) is prohibited. (12) Transactions in collusion are illegal. (13) Securities firms, if they are members of the exchange, are prohibited from endorsing securities. (14) Members of the exchange who wish to become special brokers must register separately. (15) All listed securities must comply with the provisions of last year's Securities Act and request registration. (That is, before the securities are listed, a true statement of their contents must be made.) (16) The rights of special brokers are specified separately, and ordinary exchange members shall not enjoy the same treatment. (17) All companies whose stocks are circulating in the market (listed) shall periodically submit their business statements (including balance sheets, income statements, budget statements, and final accounts). (18) The Federal Trade Commission also has the power to curb over-the-counter securities transactions. (19) The Federal Trade Commission may inspect the books and other records of exchanges or traders at any time. When necessary, it may also attend meetings of its board of directors and other meetings. (20) The maximum amount of loans that exchange members can lend to customers with securities as collateral shall be 80% of the lowest market price of the security in the past three years, or 40% of the current market price. (2) (11) This Act shall be implemented from October 1, 1934.</p>
<p>The above description, though only a few hundred words, inevitably omits some details. However, for the sake of saving space, I have to adopt such a method. Nevertheless, the true essence of the New Securities Act has been revealed between the lines.</p>
<p>(3) From the Old Securities Act to the New Securities Act</p>
<p>Originally, the American stock exchange was a so-called voluntary association. The American investment community used to pride itself on this autonomous system. Now that it has been placed under the protection of the federal government, it is truly a shocking transformation for American investment institutions. Some commentators say that this New Act unifies the blue sky laws of the various states and integrates their achievements. Compared to last year's Federal Securities Act, it is another step forward.</p>
<p>There are as many securities exchanges in the United States as there are carps crossing a river. Among them, the most influential is the New York Stock Exchange, which is well known. According to conservative estimates, about half of all stock trading in the United States takes place on the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, it is obvious that the New Act primarily targets the New York Stock Exchange. Consequently, before and during the establishment of the New Act, Roosevelt, in order to be cautious, specially established a committee to investigate exchange problems under the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. The committee devoted itself to research and clearly distinguished between advantages and disadvantages for nearly half a year. Renowned scholars such as Professor Pecora and Xue participated in the process. On the other hand, the New York Stock Exchange, in order to maintain its established reputation and independence, vowed to oppose the Act to the death and incited banks and financial institutions to support it. For a time, public opinion was in an uproar, and the debate was intense. However, Roosevelt's Blue Eagle movement was a comprehensive and systematic plan, and the securities control policy was only a part of it. In matters of great importance, one should not abandon the overall situation for the sake of small details. Therefore, Roosevelt spared no effort in shouldering the responsibility of paving the way and finally got the Act passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The policy of controlling exchanges originated in England and Germany. However, the issue only attracted the attention of the world after the economic panic. In the early 1870s, British stock prices plummeted, leading to the establishment of the Royal Investigation Commission. The commission conducted a detailed investigation of the London stock market at the time and compiled the book [The Origins, Purpose, Organization, Methods, and Customs of the London Stock Exchange], which was published and made available to the public. In Germany, between 1880 and 1890, the German Stock Exchange Investigation Commission was established to address the chaos in the stock market at the time. In the United States, after the stock panic of 1907, the Commission on Speculation in Securities and Commodities was organized, and after the panic of 1910, the Financial Trust Investigation Commission was established. As for the New Act and last year's Act, they are merely the results of the Great Depression of 1929.</p>
<p>It has been almost a year since the Old Securities Act was implemented. Under the restrictions of this Act, the exchanges have made many improvements, such as raising margin requirements, regularly reporting short selling accounts of each trader, and strictly limiting the qualifications of special brokers, etc. In short, although the automatic reform of the exchanges cannot be said to have achieved remarkable results, it has been somewhat satisfactory. However, Roosevelt was not satisfied with this and continued to enact the New Act. He implemented an extreme control policy, depriving the exchanges of their autonomy and forcing them to kneel before the federal government. The policy of financial control can be said to have reached its peak here.</p>
<p>(4) A General Critique of Securities Control</p>
<p>The content of the New Securities Act is as described above, and we have also introduced the Old Securities Act in Issue 59 of this publication. The progression from the Old Act to the New Act is also clear to us. Now is the right time to make an objective critique of the Securities Control Act.</p>
<p>Controlling the securities market may be said to be beautiful and good in theory, and right and proper in practice. However, what we have to question is whether the Securities Act is beneficial [economically]. Investment and speculation are similar in pronunciation and their natures are interconnected and not easily distinguished. Adam Smith, the founding father of economics, divided economic value into use value and exchange value, which later generations regarded as the golden rule. Taking a pen as an example, the value generated by our use of a pen is use value; the value generated when we sell the pen to others is exchange value. The same is true for securities. The value derived from selling securities is exchange value. The act of obtaining benefits from the use value of securities is called investment; the act of obtaining benefits from the exchange value of securities is called speculation. Now, use value and exchange value are related; there is no use value without exchange value, and there is no exchange value without use value. Here, we can conclude based on the syllogism: there is no investment without speculation, and there is no speculation without investment. Investment and speculation have different degrees of risk, but the relationship between them is extremely close, and in practice, it is not easy to distinguish black from white. The Act is mechanical and rigid, and it is inevitable that it is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong and loyalty from treachery. As a result, it seeks to protect investors but harms their interests instead. This is the first point we have to question.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of the shiftability of securities. Under normal circumstances, market securities often automatically adjust their quantity according to social needs. Now, the Securities Act imposes various restrictions on issuers and various constraints on investment bankers, which is sufficient to reduce the liquidity of securities and indirectly disrupt the balance of industrial and commercial economic development. Moreover, facts show us that since the implementation of the Old Securities Act, both the circulation volume and prices of securities have generally tended to decline. The ratio of securities traded by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks in the United States is recorded below. (According to Havard Buiness Review · Vol · XIINo · 3 · Jan · 1934)</p>
<p>Year Rate 1921 28.46</p>
<p>1891 29.17 1929 46.58</p>
<p>1908 43.00 1933 30.13</p>
<p>The most important policies for central banks to control the financial market are the discount policy and the securities policy. Now, since the implementation of the Securities Act of 1933, the securities that the Federal Reserve Banks can manipulate have been decreasing day by day. This is tantamount to reducing the control power of the central bank, which is truly a case of "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." As for the sharp drop in securities prices, it was 11.2 in 1929, but it fell to 4.0 in 1933. From this perspective, the Securities Act is not beneficial in terms of either the quality or quantity of securities. This is the second point we have to question.</p>
<p>Those who criticize the American exchange system have always cited its faults, such as the defects of the margin system, the prevalence of speculation, and the abuses of collusive trading. However, since the implementation of the Old Securities Act, the securities exchanges themselves have realized their mistakes and strived for reform. The old abuses have been almost completely eliminated. After this, they should be allowed to develop freely, and no further shackles should be added to them, lest they fall into decline. This is the third point we have to question.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the best policy is to avoid excesses in the control of the securities market. The Securities Act of 1934 is somewhat too hasty, imposing excessively strict restrictions on securities exchanges. I dare not praise it. However, things depend on human effort. If Roosevelt promotes it carefully, he may be able to turn danger into safety. It is better not to worry about it.</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Recover and Rise After a Dull Period</h3>
<p>＝Ultimately, It Is the Concentration of Idle Capital＝</p>
<p>＝The Bulls Have an Opportunity to Take Advantage＝</p>
<p>Last week (March 12th to 17th), the Chinese Securities Exchange gradually became active after a long period of stagnation. From activity came a rising trend. The moribund public bond market, which had seen little price movement for two or three weeks, suddenly witnessed the emergence of seven or eight new high prices. Although the environment was not favorable to the bulls, the bears also had no opportunity to take advantage. As a result of the struggle between the bulls and the bears, the floating short positions could not endure as the settlement period approached. Their defenses wavered, leading to this unexpected surge. This was also due to the stability of the situation, the abundance of money, and the concentration of idle capital, making it easier for the bulls to resolve the situation. This phenomenon has persisted for several months. The floating shorts were not forgetful, but they also recognized that market prices were already high and wanted to seize this non-existent opportunity. A week passed. Monday was one of the dullest days in recent sluggish conditions, with more than ten issues showing absolutely no movement. The rest saw movement up and down, maintaining within a range of five fen and one jiao. Trading was even more sluggish. On Tuesday and Wednesday, although the market remained flat and sluggish, and retail investors slightly shorted, prices rose slightly by about two jiao each day. On Thursday, as the empty number 75 gradually began to drop, the market price turned around, and the gloomy atmosphere was swept away. The market sentiment turned high and was revealed. On Friday, the large players moved, and numbers 5 and 59 were heavily bought. Various factions of short positions covered their positions, and the market price rose gradually, showing an image of ascending step by step, and all rose back two, three to six, seven jiao. Five treasury bonds suddenly found new high prices. Sentiment was firm, and the rising trend gradually intensified. On Saturday, although it only rose slightly by three jiao or so to five jiao, the trend was firm and stable, with no signs of weakness. Each plate still saw a slight increase of one or two jiao, and another seven or eight new high prices were found. From this, it can be seen that short speculation can only be temporary and not long-term, and one cannot seize a non-existent opportunity. This is also a new lesson. The result of a week's market prices was an increase of two or three jiao to about six jiao. The total transaction volume was 41,189,200 yuan, including 11,200 yuan in spot transactions and 41,148,000 yuan in futures. The rise and fall and high and low are compared in the table below.

<h3>Grains: Northeast Coarse Grains and Bean Cakes Shipped to Southeast China</h3>
<p>More than 500,000 pieces of bean cakes have been shipped to Shantou and Xiamen since February. All of them were shipped from Hankou to Shanghai for transshipment. As for coarse grains shipped to Southeast China, Northeast goods have always been the main products, but they have gradually decreased since the January 28th Incident. Such exports are mainly Shandong, Qingdao, Yantai, and Longhai Railway line goods. Recently, Northeast bean cakes and coarse grains have become slightly more active. Yesterday, the British ship "De An" exported 7,600 pieces of bean cakes and more than 1,000 packages of beans from Dalian to Xiamen, as well as more than 8,000 packages of beans, more than 1,600 packages of raw peanuts, more than 800 packages of melon seeds, and more than 260 packages of Job's tears to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Arrivals Flood the Market, Showing Weakness</h3>
<p>｜Each Thick Japonica Rice Also Shows Fatigue｜</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs arrived, totaling more than sixty, (estimated at more than 9,000 shih). Late rice accounted for the majority, while thick japonica rice accounted for only a small part. In the market, the outflow of late rice was not affected by the weekend, with gangs from both North China and Southeast Asia showing strong interest. However, due to the abundant supply and the large amount of unsold goods each day, the situation inevitably deteriorated. Moreover, the customer gangs were demanding, causing sellers to be unable to sell and having to lower prices to sell off. The market situation immediately showed weakness. As a result, statistics show that gangs from North China and Southeast Asia took in nearly 3,000 packages of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian goods, with the price of high-quality goods slightly down by five fen, and medium and low-quality goods down by as much as one jiao. As for thick japonica rice from each gang, the situation turned pale due to the relaxation of shop appetite. The market also showed a soft image, so the quoted price of japonica rice from Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang gangs depreciated by five fen. Although Du Yang's Jiantao rice arrived and sold at a balance, the market showed a clear and dark fatigue trend. Yinbian Yuan sales have slightly expanded, and the arrival of goods is also scarce, and the market is slightly tight.</p>

The market shape was white japonica rice, flat and tired. The price of Yangdu埠 early rice was slightly up. White Yuan and Yin Yuan were down by nearly one jiao. For thin rice, high-quality goods were slightly up, and medium and low-quality goods were slightly down, while custom tips were stable.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Bulls Liquidate, Receding</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market started high due to good news from Liverpool, but later retreated as bulls liquidated and sellers sold off in the South. As a result, spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices fell by one to three points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by four points, and futures prices rose by two points. The Bombay cotton market saw speculators buying, and the market was stable. As a result, Pingal fell by two rupees, Aumra fell by seven and a half jiao, and Bairoxi fell by two and a half jiao.

<h3>Waiting for the Development of the Penhaid Case in US Cotton Market</h3>
<p>New York, March 15th dispatch on the cotton market conditions of the week: The cotton market was quiet this week, with few transactions, awaiting the progress of the Penhaid proposal or other new impetus. Except for some trade buying to settle prices and some arbitrage, most transactions were liquidations by scattered old longs or adjustments of actual positions. After actively buying in January, the demand from the trade is now limited to orders placed when prices are low, as they want to wait for the development of the new cotton crop or better business prospects. The basis price of spot cotton in the South is slightly dimmed, occasionally due to a few sales resisting superior cotton, but the current cotton situation does not show general weakness. The price difference between US cotton and Indian cotton is increasing daily, which is now attracting criticism. Since Indian cotton is relatively cheap, the market here is now tending to underestimate the world's US cotton consumption. The cotton market is quiet, and buyers are clearly waiting for the development of reduced working hours or better sentiment regarding raw cotton price trends.</p>
<h3>The Tung Oil Market in Hankou is Gradually Weakening</h3>
<p>｜Zhejiang Tung Oil Can Still Maintain｜</p>
<p>Since the price of tung oil fell in Hankou's foreign firms in the middle of last month, the market has fluctuated, but hovered around 24.56 yuan. Because foreign firms do not have large transactions, each opening only involves dozens of tons, which is not enough to arouse market interest. The price once rose to 25 yuan last week, and people's hearts could have been strengthened, but it was just a flash in the pan, and it disappeared. Therefore, it has gradually declined in recent days, and has fallen to 24.45 yuan this week. According to details from Hankou, foreign firms are only willing to pay 24.23 yuan. Traders, seeing the decline in foreign trade and the lack of numerous transactions, can only follow the market down even if they are unwilling. It is expected that trading will start immediately. Traders are opening for in-bound goods, estimating Xiang Tung oil at 19.34 yuan and Southern Branch oil at 19.56 yuan. The market trend is still stable, because even if foreign firms remain quiet, the market has fallen to this point and should be able to stabilize, and there should be no further upward hopes. Zhejiang Tung oil seems stable and does not fall with the Hankou market, so news in recent days has consistently reported a formal market price of 20 yuan for river delivery per dan. It is also heard that a certain bean and rice shop in this port still has short positions with foreign firms that have not been covered, so it is sitting in Hangzhou to receive goods continuously. It was recently reported that several hundred units have been purchased and transported at an average price of 20 yuan. However, local firms in this port currently have no intention of purchasing.</p>

<h3>More on Human Head Sacrifices to Spirits</h3>
<p>— Yu Yangling</p>
<p>A few days ago, someone talked about human head sacrifices to spirits, believing that this is an act that expresses [shameful cowardice] and [inhumane cruelty]. But from another perspective, this act is indeed cruel, but not necessarily cowardly.</p>
<p>The most touching story of human head sacrifices to spirits, as far as I know, is in the 25th chapter of Water Margin. Wu Song decided to kill the adulterous couple and offer their heads as sacrifices in order to avenge his brother. But when his sharp knife had not yet been drawn, [the woman already knew that suing would not be allowed, put her mind at ease and was not afraid of him, boldly watching what he would do]. Saying that the enemy, but such an enemy, for Wu Song, should he strike first, or withdraw his hand? According to some people's descriptions, Western revenge seems quite polite, neither cowardly nor cruel. However, when we read Western novels, although we have not seen human head sacrifices, there is no lack of cruel revenge. According to historical records, the massacre of royalists by the masses during the French Revolution was probably no less cruel than that of Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong. As for the Russian Emperor's use of Cossack cavalry to attack petitioning masses, it was even more cruel and truly unwarlike. Therefore, even Westerners have all kinds of avengers and all kinds of enemies, strength and weakness, benevolence and cruelty, righteousness and deceit, and they are not all the same. As for [as long as the enemy can be defeated, no more calculation is needed], Wu Song also had this idea when he drunkenly beat Jiang Menshen. However, Jiang Menshen was not a Western enemy like that, so even Wu Song could not avoid bloodshed in the Mandarin Duck Tower later.</p>
<p>Water Margin says that before Wu Song offered the human heads, he first placed other offerings before Wu Da's spirit, [piled up plates of full feasts]. Jin Shengtan commented: [Four words] Cry! Who to cry for? Cry for all the people in the world. Every day, people are all gnawing ginger and sipping vinegar, not daring to eat their fill, until the day of pouring libations after death, do they pile up plates of full feasts, like Wu Da, who are common everywhere.]</p>
<p>These words are very sarcastic. But in reality, Wu Da would not know about pouring libations after death and piling up plates of full feasts. This matter only shows the snobbery of the living. Peng Jiahuang and Zhu Xiang also lived lives of gnawing ginger and sipping vinegar, and no one paid attention to them, so they died. After death, they did win piling up plates of full feasts, but they also never knew?</p>
<p>Those who sacrifice to Peng Jiahuang and Zhu Xiang mostly attribute their deaths to society, so society is indeed the enemy of Peng, Zhu, and others. However, those who sacrifice only know to sacrifice, only know to pile up plates of full feasts, only know to curse the enemies of the dead, no one can avenge the dead, and no one thinks of cutting off the heads of the current society to sacrifice to the spirits. From this point of view, Wu Song's eventual design with human heads after piling up plates of full feasts does not count as cowardice after all.</p>
<p>Moreover, in fact, human head sacrifices are not common. The Chinese custom of revenge has long subsided. Looking at the successive revolutions' attitudes toward the old and the entire people's attitude toward enemy countries, one can know.</p>
<h3>Why Can't Women's Hearts Be Poisonous?</h3>
<p>— Wu Sihong</p>
<p>I heard many men, with their legs crossed, smoking and saying: [The most poisonous thing is a woman's heart.]</p>
<p>Why can women's hearts be poisonous? I also want to cross my legs and say:</p>
<p>God is selfish, creating women with menstruation. It is commonly said: [Red things are filthy and dirty, menstrual belts are not allowed to be exposed to the sun. One can only use two in a lifetime, one for "growing up" and one for "getting married."] Making women lack energy and feel uncomfortable, people criticize her like this: [Lazy, lazy thing!]</p>
<p>Women say: [Then I don't want any men], go outside, abandon the home, have nothing to eat; it is better to be a soldier, even if I die on the battlefield, I will die happily, but [ethics] also says: [Mares do not go to the battlefield.]</p>
<p>Swallowing dose after dose of poison, when they can't swallow anymore, they naturally have to vomit dose after dose! If the son who killed his son for revenge didn't scold the monk, naturally his mother wouldn't kill her own son. But her son just scolded the monk, obstructing his mother's love affair with the monk. His mother thought: [I need a man!]</p>
<p>It's just bad luck, women have to marry. After marrying, they naturally have children. They carry them in their bellies for ten months, give birth to them and have to raise them. They don't have enough energy. If they are not careful, accidents happen. The husband says: [You can't even do housework, are you still a woman?]</p>
<p>Giving birth to children, managing household affairs, wrinkles appear on their faces when they reach thirty or forty years old, they get old, the husband has money to take a concubine, and if he doesn't have money, he runs outside to find a lover. The wife does a lot of work all day, and at night she hugs an empty bed. She can't say it, she can't figure it out. She secretly considers, let's find a young lover! [Ethics] says: [No!] Let's have a lover! People will call her like this: [Prostitute!]</p>
<p>If the opportunity is not right, the husband dies. They are young and have physiological needs. Let's remarry! [Ethics] also says: [No!] Then let's secretly have a man! People will call her like this again: [Prostitute!] Your father is dead, I am young, how can I not need it, you are here to hinder me, you just want me to suffer, since you want me to suffer, then it is better for you to die.] So his mother cut her son into two pieces with a knife.</p>
<p>If that woman has weak resistance and lacks antitoxins, then it is naturally a dead end. That is a consumptive ghost! She will come to haunt after death.</p>
<p>That was the past, and perhaps it is still the same now. In the countryside, I won't say much; living in the city, let's talk about the city. No, there are too many women in the city, let's just talk about the women who have studied for a few years!</p>
<p>Urban women are of course transformed from rural women. Because her family has a few copper coins, she goes to read foreign books. Now on the surface, women are liberated. Even if she can't be an official, it's good to sway around in society. So she reads and comes to the city.</p>
<p>After graduating from university (maybe it's middle school, maybe it's a foreign student), she should be an official, isn't the man an official? Raising her voice and shouting: [Women must have the right to participate in politics!] The noise is about to turn the sky upside down, and the man pats their shoulders: [Hey, hey, hey, hey! Little bird! You are good, I will give you a position as a secretary!] The docile one really crouches at his feet, really picks up the pen. Raising her gentle face: [Sir! How many pages should I write today?] She thought in her belly: [At least I'm an official, you have to climb step by step in life!]</p>
<p>But, what about the disobedient ones? Pouting her mouth and walking away, still muttering: [Give me a secretary position, I won't set up a porridge stall in front of the restaurant.] She despises men, hates men, hates men. But men are always needed! What else can be said about physiological needs. She puts on powder, puts on rouge, and paints her lips as red as blood, as small as cherries. Even if her mouth is as big as a cesspool, she has to pretend to be extra small. The corners of her mouth are covered with white powder. Also, putting on a fur-collared coat and wearing five-inch high golden leather shoes, all her grandmother's earrings are pawned and worn on her body. So she puts her hands on her waist again and stands in the air at the crossroads. A tram of men passes by, her eyes flutter, flutter. A large group of cars passes by, her eyes flutter, flutter. She yells in her mouth: [Come on!] A man with pulmonary disease is kicked away. [Come on!] Two men with bottomless pockets are kicked away. [Come on!] Three men with syphilis are rolled away. In this way, she is extremely happy, extremely happy, raising her golden leather shoes, spitting out the smoke of Platinum Dragon, her eyes blurred, as if to show that she has really achieved great success and needs to rest.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also want to cross my legs and say: [Why can't women's hearts be poisonous!]</p>
<h3>Jiangdu Folk Song</h3>
<p>— Qiu Zi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>When people are down, they are thin and black. When they walk in front of the door, they are caught as thieves. [Borrow fifty cents], [Not a penny to be had].</p>

<h3>About [The Criminal Black Hand] (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Secondly, we must see if the posture of reality is correctly reflected in this poem. A poem is a collection of ideas. In present-day China, there are truly many conceptual, abstract poems, and most people are using formulas. Some are [groaning without illness] about [wind, flowers, snow, and moon]. Some are there [opening, continuing, turning, and closing] writing papers. As a result, the new poems are all the same. We must know that what produces art is the correct reflection of reality. The creation of art, first of all, lies in the correct conceptualization of objective reality. Is this poem, [The Criminal Black Hand], correct in terms of conceptualization? Although it is very progressive, it is still quite far from correct. In some places, Zang Kejia reveals that he does not yet deeply understand the social situation and is abstractly using his imagination. Because of this, he failed to fully develop the material. He does not have a deep understanding of the lives of workers, and he has an even less deep understanding of the church. Superficially, he seems to be opposing religious believers. But not every religious believer is unjust. There are also many complex phenomena in the church. Naturally, Zang Kejia has no way of knowing that. I think the depiction of the church should also consider many aspects in a complex way. Many kind-hearted ignorant people are changed by the control of superstition and turn to religion! Moreover, one should focus on how foreign lords use various events of the church, and should not attribute the crime to Jesus, the son of a carpenter in the colonies. Didn't Jesus whip the Pharisees? Opposition to religion should naturally not be a problem of people, but a problem of things. And all the phenomena and aspects under the control of the church should be taken into account. Although the pain of the workers is considered more carefully, the poet's own strong philosophy of masochism still remains. Therefore, the different psychological consciousnesses of each worker are not well revealed. A major shortcoming of Zang's is that he typifies the characters and generalizes the events. However, in reality, events and characters, although they have universality, also have their individuality. This tendency to typify and generalize is Zang's fatal flaw. When dealing with a subject, the author must pay attention to its universality and individuality at the same time.</p>
<p>Although there are some places that make people feel insufficient and not real enough, in general, this [The Criminal Black Hand] is a relatively successful work. Under various constraints, Zang could only succeed to that extent! Compared with [Branding], there is naturally a world of difference. The emergence of this long poem has a fairly profound social significance. I hope that more long poems of this kind can be produced in the future.</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Quietly standing in front of the window, the sun shines brightly on my face, as if telling me: [Now it is spring].</p>
<p>Now it is spring. I know. From the sunlight filling my room, from the warm air, from the clothes of gentlemen and ladies, from the flower branches carried by travelers returning from spring outings, I have smelled the breath of spring.</p>
<p>But, where is my spring?</p>
<p>I have no spring!</p>
<p>Youth, as precious as sweet guava and periwinkle, once stayed on me. But now! It has passed. I can only use a homesick, melancholic eye to watch others laughing in spring, and deceive my own heart with a dreamy hope, alone in the cold and lonely, without the light and warmth of spring, without the happiness and laughter of spring, taking my painful steps.</p>
<p>Oh, the melody of painful life! When will it end?</p>
<p>I look into the distance blankly, with my melancholic, homesick eyes.</p>
<p>Some houses block my view. The gray houses standing like wood with a sentimental tone bring me melancholy and oppression, and my heart gradually feels heavy.</p>
<p>I am standing in a warm room full of the sunlight of spring, but my heart seems to be placed in a cold and dark winter night, without spring, without laughter.</p>
<p>I started to go outside. Like a wandering Gypsy, I look blankly into the distance with melancholic eyes. There is distant homesickness and remembrance of the past youthful life in my eyes.</p>
<p>Outside is a warm street covered with sunlight. The pulse of the city is making rhythmic movements. Spring jumps on everyone's face. Small radio receivers broadcast silver-like, loud voices in front of the store. The woman on the billboard is squinting her eyes and smiling hazily at people. In front of the closed iron gate of the cinema, a tide of audience is crowded, there are proud foreign gentlemen holding pipes, there are passionate girls with southern flavors, there are young people trapped in sexual distress, their eyes madly following the figures of women. They all equally need a kind of stimulus, a stimulus as fragrant, sensual, soul-stirring, and thrilling as the large colorful advertisement in front of the door says. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The two children really walked up to them, leaning on them as they stood. They wrapped their bodies with their arms, a kind of gentle, indescribable pleasure was making them tremble slightly. They had the comfortable feeling of being slightly drunk from drinking a little wine, those soft, fleshy little hands, that fine, soft black hair, that unique milky fragrance of the children······was making their eyes light up again, their breathing quickened, and the children's heads leaning on their chests made them feel so itchy. They involuntarily lowered their faces and kissed the children's foreheads.</p>
<p>[Sister must be too tired, you should come over here.]</p>
<p>[Not tired, I don't feel tired at all······]</p>
<p>Although they said this quickly, the children still listened to their mother and gently left them. They only showed a little disappointed eyes, looking reluctantly as the children slipped out of their arms again.</p>
<p>When the maid brought tea, Qingzhi told her to bring some candy.</p>
<p>[Sister, don't bother, it's late and they don't want to eat anything, and besides, they all have bad teeth.]</p>
<p>[Aren't the children too lonely?]</p>
<p>[We're going downstairs soon, and the sisters should rest early. After two days of travel, the children must be very tired.]</p>
<p>[How many days can you stay this time?]</p>
<p>[A month or so should be fine. The days when these children make the aunties tired are yet to come!] Qingbai smiled.</p>
<p>[I don't think it ever will.]</p>
<p>Qingbai stood up to say goodbye, still holding the children's hands, and walked out lightly again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they felt out of breath. They felt that they had talked too much, or should not have been so happy. Qingzhi sat down on the chair naturally.</p>

<h3>Retro Trend</h3>
<p>— Shou Zi</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I happened to see a piece of news in the newspaper saying that a certain place was promoting a retro trend in education, and recently launched a kite-flying movement. Whether kite-flying has any meaning or not will not be discussed here. I think the three words [retro trend] are quite meaningful.</p>
<p>China's retro trend did not start today. After every new trend, there is a retro trend. I don't know about before the Republic of China. As for the May Fourth Movement, which passed not long ago, it was followed by [sorting out national heritage], so many annotated or punctuated ancient books and ancient books were published in large and small bookstores one after another, and the trend of lecturing on ancient times [became rampant]. This was a retro trend. In 1926, the Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition. After the party army stabilized Shanghai, the Three Principles of the People became popular for a while. At this time, everyone was talking about revolution. Its manifestation in bookstores was that books such as the Complete Works of the President and Questions and Answers on the Three Principles of the People were quite abundant for a while. This period can be considered new. But now, it seems that there is a gradual trend of retro. This is why major bookstores have recently published many ancient books, and on a large scale, photo-reprinted or re-arranged. On the one hand, the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries is also being reprinted. This shows that we have now reached the second retro period.</p>
<p>Why does China inevitably have a period of [old] after a period of [new]? To answer this question, we can only explore from the nature of Chinese society and its changes in recent years.</p>
<p>China is fundamentally a feudal society. Because the essence of society is feudal, all the spiritual superstructures expressed are also feudal. Hence the meaning of respecting the ruler and loving relatives. However, this feudal system was soon destroyed by foreign capitalism. Following the destruction of the feudal system, there was a wave of [new] in all the spiritual superstructures. But this [new] is not long-lasting, because its social essence, although destroyed by foreign capitalism, its destruction is not thorough, and sometimes it still maintains the old (such as warlords welcomed and used by imperialism). On the one hand, China's new social foundation (modern large industry) has not yet been established, and all social systems are adrift, so after a while, the old resurfaces. In this way, every destruction, a new one comes, a new one comes, and then an old one comes again. Chinese society is constantly changing, and [new] and [old] are constantly alternating. The result is the occurrence of the term [retro].</p>
<p>China's [retro] reflects the ups and downs of Chinese society.</p>
<p>Of course, the regressive component is very small, and the progressive component is generally large. The so-called [old] is just a temporary appearance when temporarily stopping on the way forward. After all, it is a dying struggle, and in the future, it will only become weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>This is the origin of the term retro, and this is the essence of retro.</p>
<p>Society is constantly developing forward, but retro still appears constantly. This is really an interesting phenomenon. We do not believe that society will go backwards. Let's see how long this [retro trend] can continue.</p>
<h3>The Play I Saw: "Ladies and Gentlemen"</h3>
<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>I saw in the newspaper that Mr. Ling He directed his own play, "Ladies and Gentlemen" (also known as "Noble People"), scheduled to be performed at the YMCA today. I hadn't seen a spoken drama in a long time, and I was very happy. After dinner, I took a car straight to the YMCA. I entered the door, went upstairs, and saw people collecting tickets at the theater entrance. The inside was almost full. The clock had already passed 7:30. I said to the ticket collector at the door, "I'm looking for Mr. Ling He." He said, "He's coming soon, he's on stage." After waiting for a while, someone came and said that Mr. Ling He said there were no more tickets. My face immediately turned red, and I didn't know whether to go in or out! Just as I was scratching my head (I really did scratch my head anxiously at that moment!), my friend Old Huang walked up the stairs. We nodded to each other. I said I didn't have a ticket. He took out his afternoon ticket. The doorman said it wouldn't work. We looked at each other. He said, "Buy it, I'll treat you." I wanted to be polite and say I'd treat him, but it was too much of a back-and-forth, so I didn't say anything. I entered the theater. Old Huang saw Bo'er, and they greeted each other. The three of us sat together. At this moment, the lights in front of the stage went out, and the flute on stage was playing. (I didn't even have time to read the program.)</p>
<p>When the curtain opened, I saw Mr. Ling He himself pulling the curtain. The three of us were saying that Ling He was pulling the curtain when, unexpectedly, the screen on the stage crashed down. I thought to myself, "Oh no!" and my brow furrowed involuntarily. I was worried for Mr. Ling He, but upon closer inspection, I saw a couple kissing behind the screen. They were startled by the screen falling down. The man (played by the chauffeur, Zhuo Jianchao) ran out the door, and the woman (played by the nanny, Wang Ma, by Miss Yi Ye) was stunned. The wife (played by Ms. Liu Yin) came out of the room. From the wife's questioning and Wang Ma's lies, I realized that the screen falling down was actually part of the play. I felt relieved and couldn't help but smile. This is the director's skill! The wife had a face full of opium smoke, saying that she had just smoked a few puffs of opium and felt refreshed. She told Wang Ma to instruct the accountant to buy more of this old Yunnan soil from friends at the customs. Turning to the affairs of the family, she said that she saw things getting more and more out of hand, and she would rather recite her Guanyin Sutra. After Wang Ma lit the incense burner under the Guanyin Bodhisattva statue, the wife devoutly recited the Buddha's name and left.</p>
<p>(Old Huang said, ["The set doesn't look like the home of noble people, it's too shabby!"] I replied, "This is just the home of second-hand landlords." Bo'er added, "It doesn't look like a rich family at all." I said, "Setting the scene is really not easy, why not use cloth strips?")</p>
<p>The young lady (played by Miss Hong Dou) came in from the outer door and called "Mom." The wife was only reciting the sutra. The young lady said she had something to say and coaxed her mother. The wife had to stop reciting the sutra and asked her what was the matter. She said she wanted to go to the fashion exhibition tea dance tonight. The wife lectured her not to show her face in public. She said that she had hope of being selected as Miss Shanghai in 1934. The wife was happy that her daughter was very popular in high society. The young lady went out and took a car. The wife also went into the inner room. The wet nurse (played by Mr. Ling He's wife) and the nanny came on stage and chatted. The concubine (played by Miss Zhou Dao) came out, put on airs, and scolded them.</p>
<p>(Bo'er said, "Who is this? She's acting well." Old Huang said, "Very experienced.")</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes was heard outside. Mr. Xu Mengxiong, the secretary of the master (played by Mr. Jin Shan), came in. The concubine told Wang Ma to go in and tidy up the room, and told the wet nurse to take the young master to play. After they left, the two of them immediately became intimate. The concubine said that she had helped him get his position and wanted his reward. He said he was going to buy her something. She didn't want it, she wanted his heart. So they discussed running away, and the master's leather shoes were heard. The master (played by Mr. Zhou Boxun) came in and discussed the affairs of the factory with the secretary. He decided to think of a plan involving his daughter, wanting her to marry Liu Tiesheng, the president of the Far East Bank, as his second wife, and borrow money from Liu Tiesheng to save the factory, maintain operations, and eliminate labor unrest. The wife came out and strongly disagreed, saying that her daughter was only nineteen years old and was marrying a man in his fifties, scolding the old man for committing a sin. But she also said that she didn't care, as long as the old man could live with his conscience. Her opium addiction came on, and she went back to her room. The master just shook his head. The chauffeur ran in panting to report that the workers in the factory were on strike. The secretary hurriedly left the stage. The concubine was sneering. The master was anxious and angry, not knowing what to do. The first act was over.</p>
<p>The curtain puller pulled the curtain slowly, caught by the light in front of the stage. Mr. Zhou Boxun, the master, was still standing there with a foolish expression, causing laughter from the audience. This was Mr. Zhou's experience at work, handling it with ease, but he did not expect it to cause such laughter from the audience. The time to change the scene was too long, and the sound of hammering was constant. Old Huang said, "Too slow, the impression given by the first act is forgotten, and it cannot be connected with the second act."</p>
<h3>The One in My Heart</h3>
<p>— Shugu</p>
<p>She has gone back. In my confused memories, it seems like it hasn't even been ten days, but I've been wallowing in nameless sorrow every day, filled with melancholy.</p>
<p>When she was here on weekdays, she didn't affect me much. She couldn't be used as an instrument to measure my joys and sorrows (perhaps this is against my true feelings). In the few scattered letters we exchanged, I never obtained the slightest comfort. But now that she's gone, it has stirred up so much sadness in me. Why is this? Even I can't understand it.</p>
<p>I now feel lonely, deeply feeling the loneliness that cannot be dispelled. Parks, movie theaters... these have all become objects of my boredom. If I were to die sitting枯坐 in this small room, it would feel even more unbearable, like sitting on pins and needles. So I have no choice but to wander aimlessly through the streets. I often spend days and nights pacing back and forth through the streets and alleys, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Whenever I am surrounded by layers of emptiness and sorrow, unable to move, I will look up to the sky and take a cold breath. God is a prankster. He gave us the缘分缘分 to meet, but he won't let me fulfill my ideals. I really want to curse him deeply!</p>
<p>I have become a useless僵尸僵尸. I can't direct myself to do anything. Even the daily routines of sleeping and eating have suddenly changed into a special kind of perversion. I am like a person who has lost his soul. I am like a slave abandoned by his master.</p>
<p>Sometimes I open a book and look at it, but after a while, each square character gradually turns into a mass of black ink, and then unfolds a grim painting, with smiling gallows, tear stains, alluring figures, and beautiful shadows. Finally, with a晃恍, it reflects a blank white paper.</p>
<p>In order to find a "安神定惊 pill," my gaze wanders around me along with my thoughts. So I took out the cherished photos and letters from the箱篋篋, trying to hunt for some陶醉 from the warmth, but in the end, I only gained some狞笑, some冷视, so cruel, so bitter!</p>
<p>I often think like this: Since she is going to leave, why doesn't she take with her the deep shadow that is imprinted in my心灵深处处? Why doesn't she simply erase some of the traces of the past that can still be vaguely seen?</p>
<p>I have also decided that I am not qualified to have her. The future will eventually be tragic, so it's better to let go early. For this reason, I have made up my mind to completely bury her in the tomb of "forgetfulness." Everything has been tried, everything is in vain. I have been everywhere, I have done everything, but nothing helps. The more I try not to think of her, the more intensely the flame of youth burns, the more疯狂 and汹涌 my longing becomes. Unable to resist any longer, I immediately surrender and become a traitor to myself.</p>
<p>Yes, she is my soul. My spirit and flesh have long been entrusted to her. I may not have anything else, but I must have her. However, sacred love god, as long as you can give me a little gift, even if you only use one-thousandth of your love, I am already the "兽兽兽兽中的麒麟麒麟" and the "花花花花中的牡丹牡丹", and I can傲视傲视 everything.</p>

<p>Listen! They're fighting again. The little acrobat uses ropes to make the enemy soldiers fall. Ah, they're all Chinese!</p>
<h3>Selling Old Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Hua Ruo</p>
<p>Every day I spend ten copper coins to buy an indispensable copy of the "Shen Bao." Accumulated over a considerable period, about forty or fifty days, excluding the ones I've spent, the number becomes quite considerable. In order to recover some of the cost, I'm learning to be economical and sell them. This way, I get a little extra money, not to mention that my cramped house also has more empty space to store things. It's a win-win situation, so why not?</p>
<p>My calculation on these stacks of old newspapers started about a year ago. Thinking back to my days studying at school, what did a few old newspapers count for? Whenever I had to leave the dormitory for winter or summer vacation, I hated bringing too much luggage, so I would give away several valuable items, like热水瓶热水瓶, washbasins, and old leather shoes, to the tea boy老老老老老做 as souvenirs. This way, I was both generous and saved myself trouble. Anyway, I'd just buy new ones when school started next semester. Who at home would stint on my expenses? But the "黄金黄金时代" is over. Since I leapt from school into society with a piece of paper diploma, "时运不济济济济, 命途多舛舛舛舛舛," I've entered the "黑铁黑铁时代." It's praiseworthy that our social bureau hasn't yet implemented "失业失业登记." Otherwise, my "尊姓尊姓大名" would already occupy a cell in the 民民民民表表表表表. Now, I not only dare not look down on these "捞什捞什捞什捞什," these old newspapers; they have almost become part of my property. The income from this business has long been listed in my "生活生活表" under the "进进进进进" item. I even resent the fact that the avenues for "废物废物利用" are not broad enough. If even used matchsticks could be useful and someone would buy them, I'm afraid I would also accumulate them to exchange for money!</p>
<p>Selling old newspapers not only helps to supplement the insufficient living expenses of poor people, but it can also help people in need. I remember once when the few copper coins left in my pocket were all spent, and I saw that there was no dinner in sight, my stomach was rumbling when I happened to find a thick stack of old newspapers under the bed, and coincidentally heard the call of a scavenger outside. I suddenly had a "心血心血来潮," and immediately took the bundle of waste out and exchanged it for two "八八八八开" and seven copper coins. Although the amount was small, it could temporarily quell the "革命革命" in my belly. Its great功伟伟实不亚于亚万火万. Another time, a guest from afar visited. Unfortunately, this friend was a chain smoker, and it wouldn't be polite not to even provide him with the most basic tea and cigarettes. But I happened to be completely broke. In the end, I relied on the power of a few pounds of old newspapers to barely敷衍past this situation and avoid losing face. From these two lessons, I have since been saving all the newspapers I read every day, and I would not easily let them leave the place where they were quietly lying until the critical juncture of "水穷水穷山尽山尽山."</p>
<p>Speaking of selling old newspapers, I still feel infinitely ashamed. About two weeks ago, I sold eighty-seven pounds of old newspapers to an old man with white hair. At the time, he didn't have much money on him, and after calculating, he was still short four copper coins. He pleaded with me, saying he would make up the difference tomorrow. For a moment, I seemed to be very foolish, forgetting that the person standing in front of me was a poor old man, and the difference was such a small amount. I didn't agree to his request. Later, he was worried that the deal wouldn't go through and he would make a few文 less. He went to ask the people at the老虎老虎灶 to discuss borrowing to make it up to me, and said that he was willing to use the newspaper as collateral. But they told him off. Only then did my conscience awaken, and I felt that I was too ruthless, too mean. I said apologetically to the poor old man: "Forget it, you don't have to give it, take the newspaper!"</p>
<h3>Isn't it Bad to Have No Sons!</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>Snowflakes are flying in the sky, the north wind is howling fiercely, and the washed and pale sky fully symbolizes the mood of a weary traveler returning home.</p>
<p>It was the end of winter two years ago, one evening, after enduring a week of rocking boats and trains, I finally arrived at the path leading to my home. Through the flying snow, what clearly reflected in my eyes and knocked on my heart was a big "制制" character on the threshold. Ah, Mother, I only wish you could have lived long enough to end your suffering! My eyes blurred, followed by a buzzing sound of crying in my ears. "Fifth brother, how did you get back too!" My third brother leaned against the door, greeting me with a wry smile and tears.</p>
<p>Speaking of my third brother, I still have a relatively good impression of him. His filial piety to his parents is well-known, and he is also quite good to us siblings. He especially treated me with a 白白白的心肠心肠. Whenever he had something on his mind, he always liked to come to me to vent, although after he vented to me, it was still the same worry, and he couldn't get any relief or comfort at all.</p>
<p>Just as I was putting down my luggage, my third brother approached again and said to me:</p>
<p>"Fifth brother, mother is quickly approaching her '百百岁,' and I'm already thirty. I, I, am still just me!" Then came a handful of tears and snot, as if he had endless worries.</p>
<p>"Third brother, people always have to die. Now that mother has passed away, let it be. Worrying is useless. I think I understand this point, so I'm not very anxious!" I勉强勉强 said these few comforting words to him, and then:</p>
<p>"Third brother, you say you're already thirty and still just you. Is it because the business has been losing money too badly in recent years? If so, as long as you are serious and not 马马虎虎马马虎虎, you can be问心无愧. But it's just a harder life. What's there to be so sad about! Third brother, don't be too迂腐迂腐! Think it through!"</p>
<p>"No, no, the business has been losing money every year, but that doesn't worry me, because my life is very simple, only two of us need to eat." Again, sobbing stopped his words.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Notes</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>A magnificent scene of figures is unfolding before my eyes, and靡靡 music is drunkenly blowing and beating. Every man, like a sleepwalker in a dream, is chasing the slow yet rapid notes. They are teasing and joking with the women they are holding in their arms, and the women are also wearing flower-like smiles, but those smiles often carry a forced quality and contain a heavy taste of寂寞寂寞. Every time the musical cymbals open their throats, many people rush to dance. The women who are rushed to dance are naturally filled with快意高快意高and happiness, so they will temporarily forget the憂鬱憂鬱 of life and laugh嘻嘻 with the men. Those women who are always sitting dryly also put on smiling faces, but you can see that the smile劲儿 is superimposed. Their minds are all狂热狂热, hoping that someone will come up to them like other partners, hold them, and dance when the music starts. They are disappointed once. They lowered their heads and sighed softly, and then for the second time they opened their 狂望狂望 mouths, smiling, maybe giving a媚眼 to the men at the nearby table, but in the end it was still空望. They are always sitting alone, as if they have been forgotten, so阴郁 they are sitting stiffly in the splendor of color until dawn, and tomorrow is still sitting so寂寂一天, and in countless days, sitting for a month, a whole year...... The 緩緩音缓缓from the back of her head飄飄, drifted away,飘飘, until her youth was as withered as flowers and leaves...... At that time, you can't see her shadow here anymore. She has身身生活 to a darker environment, and those women who laugh嘻嘻 and are争争to dance as soon as the music starts are also gone, but other women who smile even harder are coming, and they are replacing everyone's previous places, the days are also separated by far, and every man who comes in has that face of a sleepwalker without a soul, and the mouth that laughs嘻嘻, they danced together from the past, now I don't know where they are going, they may have never thought about them, what they see is the woman in front of them who is more taste and more moving, like a night flower that has just opened its蕾蕾, 嬝嬝地地 stood under the华灯灯灯 in the deep night, let you look at it, and 消磨消磨 the days like a drunk and soulless行尸尸尸......</p>
<p>Acknowledgements: I would like to thank the young writer Yan Jun for donating a collection of poems called "火葬火葬," the content of which is rich and makes people think deeply. It is truly the latest reading material for contemporary youth. I have learned that Yan Jun has been well-received by general readers since the publication of his book "寂寞寂寞中的悲剧悲剧."</p>
<h3>Lulu's Victory (14)</h3>
<p>— Written by Italian M. Sescuo, Translated by Jing Xin</p>
<p>"The 現皮現皮 Lulu, but do you believe that things will go so smoothly? You know I hate arguing."</p>
<p>"Ah, an unmoving mother! Ah, Mom, you are more unbelieving than Saint Thomas! Yes, yes, from my vast experience, I can guarantee you that there will be no rumors. Robert is a gentleman, he doesn't want to marry someone who doesn't love him."</p>
<p>"What I think is impossible is Sophia's matter——"</p>
<p>"There is nothing more possible than the impossible," Lulu seriously replied.</p>
<p>"My dear, you always have so many格言! Don't say anymore. We'll see when the time comes; maybe time will sort out our affair. But in any case, it must be said that you are a糊糊涂涂蟲."</p>
<p>"And very arbitrary——"</p>
<p>"Lacking judgment——"</p>
<p>"And a狂狂动物. Say whatever you want; scold me, I deserve it; do you have anything else to say? I'm waiting."</p>
<p>"Kiss me and go to sleep. Good night, child."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mom, good night."</p>
<p>"This is better," the kind mother thought. "Lulu is still too young. Every day people see the sad results of those casual marriages. May God protect us from that! This is better."</p>
<p>"Ah ha!" Lulu said, taking a deep breath. "What kind of diplomatic means I was forced to use, what kind of tricks it took to persuade Mom! I can be a complete diplomat. What kind of victory is this! Indeed, it is certainly not a victory of love, but this is Lulu's victory!"</p>
<p>She stopped at her sister's door, listening quietly. She kept hearing suppressed sighs. Poor Sophia had already lost her peace of mind.</p>
<p>"Sleep, Sophia, sleep," Lulu gently murmured, kissing the door key, almost as if she were kissing her sister's forehead——"Quiet yourself, take a rest. Tonight, I did a lot for you."</p>
<p>So this generous daughter fell asleep, happy and satisfied by狂热 the joy of the sister she loved.</p>
<p>Time, that good old time, the eternal and wise old man, completed his work. Lulu was considering whether, as a bride to her unmarried sister, she should wear a long blue silk robe, or just a long草青草青薄 crepe robe with lace. She asked Robert if he had prepared many棒棒糖 for him, and asked Sophia if she would like to give her that beautiful embroidered handkerchief, like a breeze, a cloud. Robert and Sophia knew that this daughter was talented, smiled at her cheerful thoughtlessness and loved her, treating her as their protector.</p>
<p>"Because I always maintain," Robert. Monte Franco spoke to his friends about his marriage, "a couple should have different interests. An excellent combination. This way they can understand each other, mix together, forming a complete whole, at the same time those with the same interests are like two parallel lines; they move forward together, and will never meet. But if there is love——! I always say that." The End</p>

<h3>Mary Pickford's Heartfelt Words (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xi Leng</p>
<p>= Eloquent Defense of Douglas Fairbanks =</p>
<p>= The Body is Trivial, the Spirit is Precious =</p>
<p>Mary Pickford's inability to bid farewell to Pickfair is evident in the following words. She said, "I love everything I love, my porcelain, my glassware, my books, my lovely lingerie, my perfume, my flowers, the sunlight streaming in through the windows, the white walls and blue carpets, the inherent harmony of Pickfair, and I also love the peaceful moments I spent in those rooms. Every little thing there seems to tell me a story of tenderness and joy."</p>
<p>As for the rumors circulating that Pickford and Fairbanks would reconcile, Pickford also denied them all. She said, "All the rumors circulating that Douglas will come to New York to see me, and that we will reconcile, etc., I can say with certainty that those words have no factual basis. Douglas has already begun filming his new movie 'Adios Don Juan.' He will be shooting many outdoor scenes in Spain, so of course he cannot leave to come to New York. Furthermore, we two have never mentioned this matter. I don't know when he will return to America. I'm afraid he himself doesn't know either."</p>
<p>"However, I really don't understand the criticism of Douglas Fairbanks in various magazines and newspapers. They say he is making a film in England. But why can't he make films abroad? Is he the only one making films abroad? Why is it that when many other male and female stars make films and perform abroad, there isn't a word in the newspapers, as if it's only natural? Why do we welcome so many British actors like Clive Brook, Leslie Howard, Ronald Colman, etc., when they come to America? Why do they single out Douglas Fairbanks for trouble? In fact, Douglas is not taking American money to spend abroad. He is earning British money, and some of what he earns is still being used in America. Although his film is being made in England, the distribution is handled by United Artists, which helps America's export business by selling more films to Britain. As for the suggestion that Douglas wants to become a British citizen, I completely disbelieve it. I don't think he would do such a foolish thing. If he became a British citizen, Britain would develop the same antipathy towards him as Americans. Of course, these are all inaccurate rumors about him. You know Douglas's character, he is fickle. One moment he wants to live here, the next he wants to live there. Once he wanted to live in Ceylon. He described Ceylon as unparalleled in heaven and earth. He compared Ceylon to paradise, and he would not be happy anywhere else. Later, he wanted to live in Beijing, China. Now he lives in London. He is a person who lives on a 'magic carpet,' flying here one moment and there the next. Now that magic carpet has taken him to England. But in any case, as I said above, this is all Douglas's personal freedom of action, and no one can interfere."</p>
<p>Later, the reporter asked Mary what plans she had for the future. Mary said, "I have no plans for the immediate future. In this short period of time, I seem to exist in a vacuum, where it is empty and there is nothing. It is like a time of rest after a storm, with no change, no progress, and everything is at a standstill. These things can also be found in the course of life. We often go through years of hard work, suffering all kinds of hardships and struggles with the environment, and suddenly there comes a time when we don't want to do anything at all. I have now reached this stage. But this is not really a time of no change or progress in the course of life. This is actually a period of inward growth. The roots grow deep into the heart. This is progress, but it belongs to the heart, to thought, to the spirit. I now feel more at peace than ever before. I feel like I have survived a great disaster. The storm seems to have passed, and I feel very relaxed in my heart. I can't say that I don't feel lonely, because that would be untrue. But, after the death of my mother and brother, I have come to realize the emptiness and brevity of life. We think, the chemical components of a person's body, when collected, are not worth even six or seven cents, then the gain and loss of things outside our body is so insignificant. Furthermore, my being here and Douglas being there is even less worth discussing. Because the separation of the body is not separation; it is the separation of the spirit that is true separation || (The End)</p>

<h3>Review of [Jimmy and Sally]</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>| Great Shanghai Cinema |</p>
<p>A gentle breeze caresses the hearts of the ladies and gentlemen in the city, who leap up the steps of the Great Shanghai Cinema, silently gaze at the screen in the dark, spend two hours, and then walk down the steps again. James Dunn and Claire Dodd's beautifully posed kiss leaves a deep impression on their minds, and a satisfied smile hangs on their lips.</p>
<p>A slapstick comedy is naturally very suitable for their tastes.</p>
<p>Love, [Jimmy and Sally] naturally also writes about love. A clerk at the Marlo Canned Meat Company falls in love with the chief's secretary. The unrestrained behavior of beasts, the troublemaking of hooligans, Sally's dislike of his non-marriage idea, finally, the clerk at the canned meat company becomes a pushcart in a meat company. The pain of life finally makes him repent, and he returns to his hometown, and throws himself back into the arms of his old lover, who has become the head of the advertising department.</p>
<p>Here, we can see the struggles of some businesses in economic depression, and the pain of the unemployed, but everything is masked by slapstick.</p>
<p>Originally, the love of this pair of petty citizens was hindered from smooth progress by the social unrest and instability of the present society. In [Art and Spring Light], we saw dissatisfaction with the current decadent relationship between the sexes and the marriage system, and put forward an ideal solution, but [Jimmy and Sally] ridiculed someone who stubbornly adhered to the non-marriage idea.</p>
<p>When personal life problems have not yet been solved, a family cannot be established. Although there are other reasons advocated by those who advocate late marriage, there is no doubt that the existence of late marriage is precisely a manifestation of the general public's dissatisfaction with the current marriage system and a sense of the threat of life problems.</p>
<p>However, late marriage is an argument that succumbs to the difficult problems of marriage. Only by thoroughly solving the social problems of life can the social problems of marriage naturally be solved. But like this [Jimmy and Sally]'s depiction of a happy ending in which someone more beautiful than Sally returns is just a clever fabrication.</p>
<p>The director's handling is still satisfactory, such as the rush out of the elephant when the beasts are unrestrained, and several scenes of the hooligans making trouble in the singing hall. James Dunn worked very hard, and the so-called [newly emerging girl] Claire Dodd is also acceptable.</p>
<h3>Review of [The Midshipmaid] (Highland Grand Theater... Lyceum Theater)</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The recent British films, such as [Atlantic], and [The Midshipmaid], all take maritime life as their background. There is a considerable social basis for this reason, because Britain is a maritime island nation, and it depends on overseas colonies for its survival. Developing overseas has become the greatest interest of the people of the British Empire, so in movies, they also like to use maritime life as the background.</p>
<p>Especially [The Midshipmaid], can be said to be a boast of the British Empire's navy. The Kerne Gunship is anchored in Malta. The natives on the shore hear the sound of the gunship firing, and are frightened and climb up the trees. The lives of the soldiers are on the surface extremely joyful, rowing competitions, dances on the ship, it is really singing and dancing in peace, [Long live the Empire]!</p>
<p>Sir Percy is a [business tycoon], and he represents the naval economic austerity committee to inspect the gunship and implement austerity policies. If this is really the case, it is of course caused by economic panic. In fact, now, where is there any talk of saving naval expenses? Didn't the recent newspaper report say that the naval expenditure budget has been expanded by tens of millions, to prepare for World War II?</p>
<p>The strange appearance of the lower-ranking soldiers, without culture and education, and unable to even sing a song well, is of course the material for the upper class to joke about, and the natives' fear of [civilized] people is of course also what they take pride in. As for the vice-captain Kosbli being infatuated with the beauty of the knight's daughter and losing the competition, that is the true color of a hero. Kosbli and the knight's daughter hug and kiss behind the scenes. The knight sees it and is very unhappy, but when he learns that Kosbli is the eldest son of Naval Duke Dua, he agrees again; in such a society, daughters are naturally also good commodities for businessmen. And from this we can also see that commerce and cannons come together.</p>
<p>The story of the whole play is simple, there is simply nothing to describe. It is still just opening a song and dance concert, playing this trick, inserting some short plays within a play, it is really very monotonous.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that the artistic content of capitalist society is empty. It cannot develop a wider field for art, unless the artist turns his eyes to the other side of society.</p>
<p>Albert de Courville's directorial skills are nothing special. Joseph Mashi's performance is known for its liveliness. Her eyes have a kind of expression that is both crying and laughing. Sir Percy is old and weak, manages his daughter very strictly, but his daughter does not obey, and wants to blame the vice-captain, but is not allowed by the vice-captain's power, just like the declining posture of the old British merchants. Only the performer Fred Kerr still feels that he is not enough. As for the performance, photography, music, and the transition of scenes, they are all average, and some of the dialogues are still lively and interesting.</p>
<h3>Adolphe Menjou is the most particular about clothing</h3>
<p>Recently, the aristocratic tailors of London, New York, and Hollywood launched an election to determine which of the major male stars is the most particular about clothing. As a result, salon star Adolphe Menjou was named the male star most particular about clothing. Adolphe's wardrobe was originally very famous. His fashionable clothes for all seasons always number more than one hundred sets, all of which were made by famous craftsmen in New York, London, Paris, and Hollywood. Afterwards, Adolphe, fearing that people would misunderstand that to be a person particular about clothing, one must have a lot of clothes, issued a declaration. He said, "To be particular about clothing, a person only needs three sets of clothes. One set is a dark blue suit worn to semi-formal gatherings, one set is a suit made of well-cut coarse wool, and at most one more pair of lantern trousers, prepared for everyone to wear casually at home or when exercising, and one set of clean clothes worn by ordinary people, preferably dark brown." He said that a person who is particular about clothing does not necessarily have to have a tuxedo in his wardrobe. These words seem extraordinary coming from the mouth of Adolphe Menjou, because he himself is known for his tuxedo and top hat.</p>
<p>What makes a person most particular about clothing? According to those tailors, the first thing is to have a good physique. No matter what clothes you wear, you will look suitable. Even if you wear clothes with large squares and walk on the street, you will not cause people to look sideways. In this election, in addition to Adolphe winning the top prize, Douglas Fairbanks was also among those nominated. The other people are Ronald Colman, Clive Brook, Robert Montgomery, George Raft, and Warner Baxter. It is very strange that Prince George of England, who is usually known for his fashionable clothing, actually failed to make the list and was not nominated.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Catherine the Great [Scarlet Empress] (9)</h3>
<p>— Su Mei</p>
<p>That young guard officer was still asking her who she was. Catherine scolded angrily, "Haven't I already told you, I am the Grand Duchess?" That young man laughed loudly, "You are the Grand Duchess, I am still a Grand Duke." Catherine gritted her teeth and said, "It would be nice if you were the Grand Duke." That young man lowered his head, looked at her crimson face, and smiled and said, "If I were the Grand Duke, how could I let you wander around outside at this time?" Catherine felt that the smile was full of lust, it belonged to human nature, it was easy to understand, it was friendly, she felt a movement in her heart. She asked, "Captain, what if I don't tell you who I am, then what?" The young man paused and said, "Then... in this dark night... anything is possible... but if I'm lucky..." Catherine sighed, her already dead mood still had a trace of breath remaining, she said, "Very good, Captain, I'm afraid you're very lucky!" He suddenly picked her up, and Catherine unresistingly brought her cherry lips up to be kissed by him. Behind her, that foreign doll was abandoned on the ground, discarded, forgotten, forever...</p>
<p>This was another day, the bells of the Kremlin rang loudly again. The cannons were also booming. In the various churches, the priests led the people to kneel and pray. They were all tearfully thanking God, because Russia already had a male heir, and Grand Duchess Catherine was the mother of that heir. The Empress might have some doubts, but she was self-satisfied and did not delve into them. What she had prayed for had now been obtained. She was never accustomed to seeking the final destination of a matter. In addition to course, only Grand Duke Peter knew in his heart that he was being congratulated for no reason, but he tried his best to suppress his resentment and cunningly arranged his plans. As for Catherine herself, she acted fearlessly, she was neither anxious for hope, nor condemned by conscience, she just acted as usual as if she had a plan in mind. She rode her horse in the suburbs every morning, galloping on the snow, accompanied by one or two young nobles every day. She showered favors indiscriminately, and those who received them, because of her beauty and status as the future empress, all wanted to repay her to the death. She went to the poor areas every day, distributing gifts, giving large baskets of food to the poor, personally comforting them, encouraging them, she reviewed the army, praised their neat formations, and brilliant military uniforms, so that the military hearts all returned to her, willing to be crushed for her. At the same time, in her cold heart, her desire to usurp power was also expanding day by day... determining her future... manipulating everything, everyone... proceeding regardless of success or failure.</p>
<p>As for her son, she rarely met him. The Empress was extremely wary of him, and all of his clothing, food, and education were all taken care of by herself, but Catherine did not care at all. Russia wanted her to give birth to an heir, and she had already given birth to one, as for all other red tape, she did not care about them at all. She and Alexei had also not seen each other for a long time, because the Empress had already sent him abroad. Duchess Elizabeth had been condemned by the Empress and was not allowed to enter the palace again. Grand Duke Peter was alone in the house, depressed, and only consoled himself by shooting countless idols of his wife every day... quietly waiting for the opportunity. (To be continued)</p>
