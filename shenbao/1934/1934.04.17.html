<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀民國二十二年度中國銀行報吿書後求　揭發國民經濟之危機</h3>
<p>民國二十二年度之中國銀行報吿。現已公佈。全文已載日昨本報。就報吿之性質而論。本爲該行總經理張公權氏循例向股東總會報吿一年營業經過而作。藉以示該行所决定之營業方針。並使各股東明瞭該行與社會經濟之關係。惟以該行在目前中國金融組織所處地位。與尋常商業銀行。略有不同。且其報吿内容。包羅甚廣。故吾人與其視爲私家公司對於股東之營業報吿。毌寗視爲一年來中國國民經濟史的描寫。亦無不可也。</p>
<p>就報吿之編述而論。關於數字之列示。與陳述了方式。吾人誠不必以如何信而有徵之作述相視。如該報吿指出二十二年度中央政府全年收入爲六萬八千餘萬元。而支出則爲八萬二千八百餘萬元。未及及說明此項數字。不過爲現政府之中央槪算。從可知現政府中央收支之實際虧空數目。所謂恒在一萬四千萬左右云者。迄今猶只能使吾人心領神會此不解之謎卽叩之吾國財政當局。恐亦未必能驟舉以吿。此則財政制度之紊亂有以使然。非該行當局所能爲力。惟吾人有須明瞭者。該行以一私家公司。而能注意及於該行與本國社會經濟之關係。大聲疾呼。舉國民經濟之危機。以警戒國人。誠爲難得。所欲問者。以今日一般社會之漫無組織。麻木不仁。欲從而推動之。以挽此將臨之末運。謂爲未臻絕望之地。則其道安在。卽有挽救此末運之道。然能否實現。又能否有效。亦不能令人無疑。</p>
<p>吾人以爲該報吿所最足引人注意者。卽在於統制產業與財政金融之健全性二段。由前段論。該報吿指出中國無健全之通貨制度。故儘有歐美之良法美意。不能移之於中國。此論實似是而非。蓋健全之通貨制度基於健全之國民經濟組織。該報吿不明白吿吾人以帝國主義侵略下之通貨制度。無由健全。予國人以正確之認識。而徒注意於貨幣行政之改良尚非根本之言也。由後段論。該報吿所指出現時財政金融之危機。一在於政府之濫用無度。二在於國民收入之銳縮。三在於外國在華直接投資之擴張。斯則深爲吾人所同意者。現時中央預算收支。不能平衡。由於不生產之消費。全國國民收入之日縮。則由於外國勢力之侵陵。所謂封建殘餘與帝國主義之蹂躪。均能於該報吿中切實敷陳。使一一反映於國人眼簾之前。而引起國人之警惕者也。　　吾人讀報吿書後。以爲國民經濟之危機。經該報吿盡情指陳。固已宛然在目。惟對於如何謀根本救濟之方策。則尚絕未道及。將徒有呻吟而無努力之途徑乎。如曰救濟途徑。乃政府之工作。則積極性的建議案。非目前迫切而需要者乎。是誠猶有待於我銀行界與全國國民之努力如何矣。</p>

<h3>國際形勢不利日本暫緩攻俄　美方觀察危機未去　日正鞏固在華勢力　傅逆竊號兩重意義</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據今日此間高級軍事及外交觀察者多人之意見、日本似欲一意鞏固其在中國及滿洲之勢力、故遠東戰機大有和緩之望、更據多數消息靈通者聲稱、傳聞已久之日俄戰爭、未必即在今春爆發、據目前形勢、所謂不可免之日俄戰爭、尚可延宕數年、亦未可知、惟東京以至莫斯科之空氣、仍充滿緊張情調、西比利亞一帶之危險性、確有牽一髮而動全身之可能、故無人敢謂危機已消、日俄兩國領袖現正設法减少戰爭危機、故局勢趨於和緩、確已顯然可見、軍事觀察者昔認日本視蘇俄之工業化有向日本在遠東霸權挑釁之意、故擬乘蘇俄勢力尚未鞏固時實行先發制人、而以三月爲發動時期、乘春夏秋温暖時季攻入蘇俄、然此間多數專家現今已不作此想、其理有三（一）蘇俄現已在滿洲邊境佈置重兵及軍實、計軍隊在十萬人以上、飛機五百架、此外尚有坦克車·重砲·軍糧·與軍火之屯積、及橫貫西比利亞鐵道多處地方敷設雙軌（二）世界輿論不直日本之挑釁行爲、因此在心理上及外交上引起不利於日本之空氣、蘇俄之政治家·意首相墨索里尼·美國之演說家等、均爲造成此種空氣之人物、（三）日本領袖目下似注全力以發展「滿洲國」及對華關係、而溥儀之登位有兩重意義、一在鞏固其「滿洲國」之勢力、一在威脅華北、多數專家認爲日本意圖增進其在中國之勢力以抑蘇俄、因日本如在中國能獲新權利、則蘇俄將無能爲力、目前之大戰旣可避免、此種行徑且得不營而獲、况日本如能利用中國低廉之勞工、在經濟上亦可戰勝西方與蘇俄之商業競爭也、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）外交政策恊會今日發出文吿、對一九三五年之海軍軍縮會議提出警吿、謂苟日美兩國不改變其政策、則該會勢將失敗、該文内稱、苟日本堅持變更現存之五五三海軍比率、希圖取得較高之比率、而美國又因執不承認僞滿洲國、則未來之海軍軍縮會議、欲求達到彼此諒解、希望甚微、苟會議結果歸於破裂、則日美兩國、勢將盡量競造軍艦、海軍比率限度、勢將打破、影響將及於其他各國、故華盛頓會議若失敗、結果將不堪設想、日美兩國、對於影響遠東大局之問題因之亟應愼重、國際公法家司高德博士、爲國際和平基金扎撰之論文、批評現</p>

<h3>澳田乘機親交　解决通商及互換公使問題</h3>
<p>（東京）澳州之訪日特使列沙姆外相豫定五月八日抵長崎、其表面之使命雖爲日澳親善、實因現在日本對澳貿易每年輸入超過一億餘元、澳洲政府以當此日英通商關係缺欠圓滑之際、認日澳通商上有要求將來諒解之必要、故特派列沙姆氏之有力閣員赴日、故訂立日澳通商條約交换公使之二交涉、可因該外相之來日而具體化、日政府亦以此爲調整從來日澳片面貿易之絕好機會、對與該外相之會談與以多大之期待、廣田外相向稱以交換公使爲日澳親善通商關係緊密化之最良手段、故此次此事必有急速之進展、又廣田外相以同樣之意義、希望日印通商條約簽字完畢後、印度方面特派如卜亞商務長官之有力臣來日、（十六日電通電）</p>

<h3>日本竭力親美</h3>

<h3>林陸相之留任　由於軍部之擁戴</h3>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相今日上午拜謁日皇、奏聞林陸相留職經過、又陸軍省今晨上午十時召開非公式軍事參議字會議、報吿林陸相留任事情、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）林陸相自提了辭表後、其辭意頗强固、拒絕一切慰留、然至十五日三長官會議之結果遂打消辭意、决定留任、據聞其至留任之事情如下、（一）林陸相提出辭表後、政府考慮繼任人物、然因各種情形複雜、未能决定、且各方面開始發動、以致困難詮衡繼任人之情勢、（二）陸相於議會開會中就任、當時雖有軍民離反及軍人于涉政治等各問題、然得世間同情、又於師長會議明確表示軍部方針、以博陸軍部内之信望、（三）陸軍因國際形勢嚴重、有實行國防工作之要事、在此重大時機、陸相辭職、不能准許、閑院參謀總長亦慰留、於是陸相遂决留職、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政府因林陸相鑑於時局重大、决意打消辭意、决照十日閣議决定方針邁進、以期克服時局難關、齋藤首相將於下月四日開會之地方長官會議、宣布政府重要政策、尤其整理財政·稅制·刷新敎育·確立農村對策等、說明具體方法、政府雖以林陸相之打消辭意、得一時小康、然文相補任問題、小山法相控吿問題、及某次［官之某事件等、尚未解决、且其前途不許樂觀、主張一致團結、努力邁進之現内閣、未得完全之安定也、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福督促通過議案　以便國會於十五日開會</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統自與參院領袖竟日會議後、今日復與衆院領袖會議、衆信今日之會議、或須延至深夜、會議目的、仍在處理議案、並草一具體計畫、以期國會得於五月中閉會、羅總統尤注意於早日通過關稅案、得與外國商訂互惠商約、對證券交易所管理案亦望其成立、總統信此二案在國會議程中俱屬非常重要、至於普通賦稅案不過認爲一種倵行公事而已、惟現在之賦稅案則不然、因該案志在增高遺產稅及富人之所得稅、並有杜絕富人漏稅之計畫多種、故内容異常透澈、參衆兩院雖均已通過賦稅案、然其中數點、兩院意見隔閡殊深、談待兩院聯席會議後始能决定、本年度之賦稅案、較諸以前諸案性質截然不同、故總統先須將其研究、然後送交參衆兩院之聯席委員會、衆院領袖亦可藉此决定總統對於該案之態度、椰子油抽稅百分之三徵稅一欵、未爲總統核准、因其將使菲律濱羣島之經濟狀况、受嚴重打擊也、衆信羅總統關於戰問題、已有咨文送交國會、據稱、政府願將核减戰債與减低債務國貨物之進口稅一併討論云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日在白宫與衆院領袖作三小時會議後、發表其對於各種白銀案之意見、據參加會議者稱、總統本無拒絕戴土案之意、依照該案、美國將以高價接受白銀作爲購買美國剩餘農產之付欵、然總統反對混合白銀案、因其使白銀成爲國有也、參加會議者繼稱、總統仍未改變反對顧爾特室洛案、該案主張設立一貨幣儲備局、以氏替聯邦儲備銀行、以統制貨幣之發行、如物價在一年内較標凖價高出或低落百分之五、該局有權增减金元之黃金成分云、據稱、總統要求衆院通過星期六日與參院領袖商定之具體計劃、衆院多數派領袖比恩氏推測、衆院將接受總統之意見、而於五月十五日閉會、但參院之態度如何、今尚屬疑問、今日據參議員湯姆斯稱、國會議員將多被邀參加四月十三日之議會、以求調和各派意見、能通過一單純之貨幣案也云、（十五日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日本國債突破八十億元</h3>
<p>（東京）據大藏省發表至本年三月底止、現在日本國債總數意突破八十億元、實達八十一億三千九百零三萬九千元、較去年此期之七十億五千四百一十九萬五千元、乃增加十億八千四百八十四萬三千元、而本年度發行之公債預定數量爲十億元、故本年度國債當突破九十億元、若加以增發之米榖證券與短期證券合算之、完全可達一百億元云、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>德將停付戰債列强又遇新難局　國家銀行存外幣日少　楊格計劃將完全擱置</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國佛蘭克阜娜報今日豫料、德將完全停付道威斯與楊格計劃下之債欵、謂德國不得已將向債權國聲明、限制今後解付乃不可倖免之事、任何債欵不能例外、其原因由於德國國家銀行所存外幣之日見减少、德國將於四月二十七日德國債權人在柏林舉行會議時宣佈此意云、如德國果停付債欵、若該報所言、則列强將遇有一種困難、查道威斯計畫乃道威斯等專家委員會依據德國財政情形及償付賠欵能力而提出之方案、後代以楊格計畫、規定德國分年拔還戰債、付入國際淸理銀行、而以德國尋常商業債劵爲抵、以德國鐵路等爲其付欵資源、並規定一九三零年付十七萬零七百九十萬馬克、以後在三十五年中、每年逐加、計在一九六五年須付二十四萬二千八百八十萬馬克、但在一九六五年後、則不逐漸减少、一九六六年付十六萬零七百七十萬馬克、迨至一九八七年、則僅付八萬九千七百八十萬馬克、楊格計劃之異於道威斯計劃者、在切實規定每年應付之數、而非視國家繁榮情形定付欵多少、且規定德國有財政自主權、而必附以外人監督之任何計劃、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>歐洲方面尚無戰爭可能　因各方軍力大相懸殊</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦一般外交家觀察、均以爲歐洲不致立卽發生戰事、因戰禍之啓端由於兩國之衝突、據觀察結果、歐陸國家尚未見有兩國已在秣馬厲兵預備决戰者、外交家稱、歐洲運命固在一般鼓吹戰爭者之掌握中、然任何學童均知並無兩國或許多國家願爲戎首、各國深知、若無同盟之結合、决不能制德國之死命、各國深知希特勒决非愚人、願驅德國人民於屠殺者之手、且任何兩國、一啓戰端、則欲歐陸戰禍之停止、决非頃刻間事、就法國及其同盟國之軍力觀之、德國果能破之乎、此固難預言、然苟德國不願開戰、則欲戰亦不成矣、披覽歐陸地圖、可見德國樹敵甚多、而友好者則未之見、三面有法·波蘭·及捷克環峙、故德國决不能向任何一國單獨而戰、若三國聯合對德、則在數星期中、德將一敗塗地、如意大利聯德以抗法、波蘭·捷克·南斯拉夫·及羅馬尼亞必將立起以對意、故雖以德意聯合之雄師、亦遠不如法·波·捷克·南斯拉夫·以及羅馬尼亞五國之聯合陣綫也、法·波·捷克等國、可出聯軍五萬人、並可以機關槍爲掩護、然依照凡爾賽條約、德國僅凖許出兵二千、卽使德國臨時届動大兵、亦無能爲也、就砲隊論、法·波·捷克·三國、可出七千隊、而德國祗准有三百隊、雖意國可供給德國二千隊、然三國之總數、加以南斯拉夫及羅馬尼亞兩國參加二千四百隊、猶相差懸殊也、三國可出坦克車五千部、而德國則禁用此車、如意德相援、意可供德坦克車百五十部、然較之南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞兩國加入之數、又大相懸殊、以言空軍、法·波·捷三國共有軍用機四千四百架、而南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞兩國共有七百架、以言軍隊、德國正式軍隊計有十萬、然戰事一啓、卽有經訓練之軍隊百萬參加、並在和平時代、依德國之報吿、法·波·捷三國計有常備軍一百萬人、而戰時則可擴充至九百萬人、意大利有五百萬、然較諸南斯拉夫及羅馬尼亞兩國加入之數、則其勢又相懸殊矣、故德國在任何情勢之下、殊難對法及其同盟軍作戰、除非波·捷兩國袖手旁觀、則德容有戰獨對法之機也、故依日内瓦外交家之意見、以爲大戰之在歐陸尚非短期内所得發生、依彼輩之觀察、以爲大戰似將爆發於遠東、然後蔓延而至歐洲云、</p>

<h3>法國對保親善　巴爾幹另訂新公約</h3>
<p>蘇菲亞據此間新時代報載稱、保加利亞似將被邀請簽字於巴爾幹不侵犯新公約、此項公約、與前在雅典簽字之鬯爾幹恊商公約完全不同、乃係根據波蘭與德國不侵犯公約之精神而起草者、此項公約之發起、似出於法國方面、最近保國總理慕洽諾夫遊法時、與法國外長巴爾都談話、其内容大部份係與此問題有關、但據法國日報所載、則謂正式提議、當係由羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥、由保國總理慕洽諾夫提出、而由慕洽諾夫與以同意、就最近慕洽諾夫在巴黎備受歡迎之情形觀之、則法國對保加利亞顯已變爲親善之態度、此則一部份乃由於去歲八月間現任不管部閣員赫禮歐、往訪保加利亞之結果、蓋自是以後、歐洲重要國家、對於保加利亞之同情、固有增無已也、並聞希臘外長馬克西謨斯·羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥·以及南斯拉夫國當局、均願立卽開始談判、以解决各該國與保國之懸案云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>依據了各方的明證、日本確將再來一次侵略華北的威嚇舉動、究共用意無非是藉此脅迫國民政府、作城下之盟、隨之承認「滿洲國」罷了、現在留滬的日本公使有吉明、已經屢次表示、要返東京的意思、但他曾吿知南京官塲、在他離華之前、先要接到中國的答覆、</p>
<p>到底日本是否將驅兵直逼平津、而觸發國際間又一次的烈焰、她還在極度的猶豫着、但今日之日本、在國際間是陷入異常嚴重的窘境裏、如果不能威逼中國承認「滿洲國」、實無法自拔、關於下届海軍會議的事、日本政府尤須於今年年底以前、正式通吿英美兩國宣示她的意旨、丨換言之日本須切實表示、是否將要求和英美兩國的海軍、有一個平等的比率、</p>
<p>至於海軍比率的事、英美兩國都曾經通知過日本、若於目前規定好的五丨五丨三的比率、有任何顯著的更動時、必將一致反對、此外、還吿訴日本說、萬一日本對於現定的比率、堅持更動、則整個的遠東問題、須重新討論、所以、在下届軍縮會議召集之前、日本想把中日關係、理個淸楚丨丨尤其是亟欲使中國承認「滿洲國」、因爲這樣、在下届會議時、因滿洲問題而釀成的全會的爭論、不但可以消弭、並且還能束缚中國的手足、使她的代表、不能仿照一九二一丨一九二二年華盛頓會議席上提出山東問題的那回老例子、</p>
<p>再來請求提出滿洲問題了、</p>
<p>並且、中國承認了「滿洲國」後、便會立刻開闢方便之門、使任何國家來承認這個</p>
<p>傀儡、丨到了那種地步、大家在軍縮會議席上、都可很安靜的坐下來、不致有他種擾亂、那時、經過某種修改後、縱然是個較小的海軍比率、祇要足以保全日本軍國的顏面、日本也就樂於接受了、</p>
<p>「滿洲國」又將構成國際問題的難關、於此可見、中國一天不肯加以承認、各國便一天不能放懷、其實據傳中國已受過歐洲各方的强有力的暗示、中國祇要承認了「滿洲國」、並解除其與日本的糾紛、則類如借欵之事、在將來或可有某種的裨益、自從美日換文不久以後、倫敦和巴黎兩處、就發出一種宣傳、確說美國是在打算着承認「滿洲國」了、丨歐洲人對於這國際問題的難關、是怎樣在思慮着、推測着、關切着、也就可以槪見了、但是這些歐洲宣傳者是錯的、因爲美國並不想承認「滿洲國」、除非中國自己先承認了、但中國如要承認了「滿洲國」時、於日本帝國主義自然是有利、而於中國自己、則不啻是個致命傷、這會構成有力的證據、證明在整個滿洲事件的爭執中、日本是對的、中國是錯的、這會將中國整個的安放在日本軍人的支配之下、這會把亞細亞大陸上、五十年來民主運動發展的功績、摧毁乾凈、而二十餘年來中國從事於民權建設的收穫、京將剝奪無餘、反使國家形成了日本帝國的屬國、這會使中國有獨立精神的官吏、隱避他方、而使他們本來所管轄的地方、另由一輩暗中受人指使的傀儡漢奸來接手過去、彷彿和現在滿洲所扮演的一幕醜劇一樣、</p>
<p>因爲日本在滿洲事件上、不顧自己能力、好大喜功、現在已瀕於財政經濟政治各方的危境了、但假使她能逼迫中國承認滿洲國、則在國際間的形勢、不難立刻變轉過來、她可以向國外借無量的外債、用之於鞏固她在亞細亞的地位、用之於促成中國變成她的純粹的殖民地、</p>
<p>這是毫無疑問的、現在華北的局勢、因日本的恫嚇脅迫、而異常嚴重、更無疑地、如果日本軍人竟斷然在此風聲鶴唳中、任意放肆起來、華北的局勢、便會越發嚴重、但是、際此嚴重時期、萬一中國屈服而自願接受與國家生死存亡有關的承認「滿洲國」條件、那末、不但華北一部分的局勢、無望挽回、卽整個的中國、亦將陷入絕望的境地了、</p>

<h3>黃郛昨晨由贛抵滬　接見記者團述華北情勢　留滬三四日轉赴莫干山　兩星期後再返北平視事</h3>
<p>行政院駐平政務整理委員會委員長黃郛、以辦事棘手、表示倦勤、日前平南下、赴贛謁晤蔣委員長、報吿華北情形、行政院長汪精衛、亦趕往會晤、商洽應付辦法、黃氏迭經蔣汪面加慰留、辭意已可望打銷、黃氏由贛乘新輪來滬、業於昨晨十時抵埠、擬在滬勾留三四日、然後赴杭州嘉興兩地掃墓、再赴莫干山休息、約兩週後北返、昨日下午三時半、黃氏在庽接見中外各報社記者、暢談華北局勢、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>昨晨抵滬</h3>
<p>黃氏於南昌會、晤汪院長蔣委員長後、卽偕同顧問葛仲新、及隨員王大剛·何其偉·高士鸞·等一行五人、於十四日晨、乘招商局江新輪離贛東下、於十五日午過京駛滬、該輪於昨晨十時卽抵達金利源碼頭、本市公安局及水巡隊、均派武裝警士到埠保護、黃氏舊部、如徐季實等、亦均往碼頭歡迎、黃氏於該輪未停泊碼頭時、卽登市公安局小輪、先行登岸、乘自備汽車、逕返祁齊路私邸休息、黃氏返寓後、外交部次長唐有壬、因患病、派外部周秘書前往晋謁問候、兩路局長黃伯樵、市工務局長沈怡、市政府秘書耿嘉基、以及黃氏親舊、均先後晋謁聚舊、</p>
<h3>接見記者</h3>
<p>中央社云、黃氏抵滬後、卽通知各報社約定下午三時卅分、在寓所接見中外各報社記者、發表重要談話、計到中外各報社記者五十餘人、黃氏昨衣藏靑西裝、容貎較前淸瘦、出見後、卽次第答復各記者詢問云、本人於去年此月間、奉命北上、主持華北政務、　迄今已逾一年、具見仁見智之决心、爲黨國做事、以不長宣傳、故不敢自謂於此任職期内、已作有若干事務、向外宣傳、惟有事實可查、且覺凡做一事、其優劣之分、在旁人視之、必具有兩種觀察、第一種專視目前不顧將來、第二種則顧及將來、因此優劣之分、遂有目前與將來之别、而是非毁譽、一時亦難得標凖、</p>
<h3>赴贛經過</h3>
<p>黃氏繼談、本人此次南下赴贛、分晤汪蔣兩氏、報吿國際間形勢曁國家前途、以及華北種種事宜、通車通郵及各口設關卡問題、則未曾單獨提出討論、本人又以任職於茲、辦事困難、覺精神與身體、均感痛苦萬分、深盼中央加以明瞭、並懇中央將此重大華北職務、請國人流輪担負、共救危亡、偌大我國、如許國人、不應將此極重大職務、付之於一二人身上、與汪蔣晤商後、已獲准兩星期之假期休息、北返日期、俟過兩星期後再定、</p>
<h3>華北情形</h3>
<p>關於華北情形、日來外傳紛紜、莫衷一是、實則所傳與事實不符頗多、日本在華北、最近在事實上、并無重大要求提出、惟零碎要求則甚多、所以一年來、華北無關係中日間之重大事件發生、東北軍之在華北者、共計十九師、自張漢卿返國後、南調者已達九師、故現在華北者、計萬福麟部六師、于學忠部四師、黃氏繼又謂、本人南下、每有人問及華北外交如何、實難予以回答、蓋外交係我國整個之外交、决無華北與華南之分也、</p>
<h3>戰農賑區</h3>
<p>至於華北災區善、後事宜、平津兩地戰後、共有災黎數十萬人、現已陸續送回、所以急賑工作、業已吿竣、目下時届耕種、故農賑工作之進行、實爲急迫、現已著手進行、并已聘請以前主持華洋義賑會之陳君、主持一切、但華北災區廣闊、賑欵僅四五百萬元、頗感杯水車薪、無濟於事、至於華北内叛、先後共計八次之多、現已一一剷平、於施政及地方、均有極大關係、蓋人民可以安居樂業也、黃氏又謂、華北建設、亦民進行、馬蘭峪興玉田間電話、一星期内可以接通、其他各處、亦將依次推進、至於日本武官分赴華北各要地偵察、此等事件、不自今日始、亦恐不止華北一處、自本人忝長華北政務以來、迭有所聞、所以每日伏坐辦公室中、無異坐針氈而背有芒刺也、</p>
<h3>返籍掃墓</h3>
<p>記者繼詢以此次、到滬、將與日使有吉明謀面否、據答、互相拜會、係一普通之事、有會面之可能、卽在滬各使、亦將互相訪晤也、擬在滬作三四日之勾留、然後赴杭州嘉興兩地掃墓、蓋本人去年奉命北上、未曾掃墓、今年必須一行、並將赴莫干山暫居、度此兩星期之假期云、</p>
<h3>書面談話</h3>
<p>黃氏昨晚發表書面談話云、鄙人自去年五月受命於華北危難之際、迄今已將歷一年、此一年中經過情形何若、事實俱在、無庸再加說明、雖見仁見智、各有不同、但欲爲國家稍負責任、稍减國難之心、始終如一、此次南旋、述職經過、各地各界關心國事之人、以華北外交如何爲詢、鄙人以爲外交係一個國家整個問題、故若問地方情形何若、華北經濟情形何若、尚猶可說、若言華北外交、則根本不能成立此名詞、鄙人關於對外問題、無一不承中央意旨以行、實無所謂華北外交也、雖在今日情勢之下、外交問題之關於華北地方者尤爲迫切、則爲事實耳、至若内政方面、建設整理固談不到、然雜軍之編遣、戰區之接收、流亡之安集、賑務之推進、却亦複雜多端、至不容易、現在内外兩方、總算比較安定、自顧精力疲敝、甚願及時息肩、而中央又復以大義相責、未能卽允、故擬先旋里掃墓、略事休息云、</p>

<p>（小前言）在這次收回的讀書調查表中，我們獲得了許多非常寳貴的材料、使我們更進一步的明瞭了讀者諸君的讀書生活、現在先就「讀書計劃」方面來說幾句話。　　許多讀者尚未定出自己的讀書計劃，這一方面是因爲生活太忙，不由你有一定的讀書時間，卽令定出計劃，除不由你按照計劃去做；一方在郤是不大注意讀書要有計劃，仍抱着拿着書就讀，讀罷也就完事了，管它「計劃」不計劃。關於前者，我們沒有話可說，是一個事實的問題，關於後者，我們覺得還有盡幾句忠言的必要，因爲這與一個人讀書的成敗是大有關係的。　　業餘的時間是何等的有限呀！如果不將這寳貴而又有限的每天幾小時，很好的利用它，這是很可惜的。讀書不僅是「開卷」而已，在「開卷」以前，你應問問自己··（一）這本書是否是你應該讀的？（二）這本書是否合你的程度？（三）這本書與你以前讀的書是否有聯繫？讀了這本書後，可以進而讀什麽呢？這裏就包括了你的過去，現在，將來的三方面，不僅是「開卷」的這一瞬間。這裏就暗示了你應有一個「計劃」。　　其次，是「計劃」不要太大、要切實際。計劃應以百分之百能實行爲原則。否則，雖有計劃也無多用。我們常常在讀者來信中看見有許多計劃不合實用的，這是因爲在定計劃前沒有深刻考察之故。　　還有少數讀者，自己不能定出計劃，開了一張個人生活履歷，要我們替他代定。這也是一種誤解。個人的讀書計劃是應由自己定出的，因爲知道自己最親切的是自己。别人代定出的東西，總有點「隔鞋搔癢」。我們只能站在帮助的地位，替每一個要我們帮助的朋友做一點「修正」和「補充」的工作，自己的計劃，仍要由你自己深切的考察，實際的定出。「情報」（一）外埠申報讀者，紛紛要求加入本部，探詢加入乎續，請注意今日本刋的特載。　　（二）讀書成績調查表三日内收到百餘張，張張塡得十分詳細，超過我們期望以外。　　（三）本週收到誠意討論讀書函件一百二十封，開本部以前未有的最高記錄。　　（四）「讀書問答」集第一集已在校樣中，第一版僅印三千部，定價三角，由本報特種發行處發行。本書承國内讀書界頗注意，紛紛來函預定，本部决定關於發行方面一切手續均由本報特種發行處辦理，恕不一一作答。但對本館讀者（至最近止達五千人），應給與優先權，第一段大槪均在本埠銷售，外埠僅以郵購爲限。　　（特載）怎樣參加「讀書指導」？（一）凡本館讀者或外埠本報讀者，有興趣與本館讀書指導部作學問研究者均歡迎加入，不分性别，學歷，對於學徒，店員尤爲歡迎。　　（二）本館讀者可逕向本館索取（函索亦可）聲請書塡就送館，聲請登記··候本部審查完竣後，發給登記證，卽爲本部經常研究者，外埠申報讀者則需先經過與本部作過一二次通信，並向本部提出要求，本部認爲也於誠意者，本部卽寄出聲請書，其他手續與本埠讀者同。　　（三）本部不收一切費用。　　（四）本部工作範圍，暫以··（一）討論讀者自定自學計劃；（二）對每一學科自學的商討；（三）書報介紹；（四）解答書中疑難。　　（五）本館讀者來信務須開明（一）登記證號碼，（二）詳細通訊處；本報讀者來信，惟貼有「讀書問答」印花爲有效。　（六）來信請寫明··上海南京　大陸商塲三樓申報流通圖書館讀書指導部收。　　（特别廣播）（徵求本館全體讀者對於「讀書會」的意見）　　本部及本館借書部讀者前後來函要求本館成立讀書會，本部因創設伊始，一時無暇及此，未能個别致覆，深以爲歉！現在來信日集日多了。茲特將此項建議公開提出，讀者諸君，如果感此需要，請來函聲明贊同，並提出具體意見。由本部彙集意見，成爲讀者的積體的建議，再經本館館務會議通過後，卽以帮助者之地位，負召集第一次會議之責任，以後組織方面完全由讀者諸君自動進行，在學問上本館則取切實合作，互相帮助原則也。來信請寄本館讀書指導部。　　（信箱）外埠本部讀者諸君··本館外埠郵借，此時尚不能普及，對於參加本部研究諸君，如果感覺讀物需要，本館亦不能不特别代諸君設法，故有本部讀者得享本館離滬讀者郵借之權利的决定。現在關於郵借手續具體規定於下··（一）參加本部後，在一月内經常向本部作學問上通信，經本部考察認爲非常誠懇者，本部卽發給本館郵借介紹書，介紹郵借部。（二）郵借手协槪歸郵借部辦理，本部不代收接任何信件，亦不代作任何答覆。但讀者接到本部介紹書後，可將該函直寄本館郵借者索取申請書，要求登記。郵借保證僅金二元。天氣報吿　　徐家匯天文臺昨日午後四時三十分氣象預報云、、揭子流域與此間一帶、天氣晴和、晨有輕霧、山東四周與此間、海濱、有微風、臺灣海峽天曇、有和緩之東北風、又昨日午後三時前、二十四小時内、本埠氣温、最高六六·九、最低三五·一、去年同日、最高四九·六、最低四四·四、公共租界工部局衛生報吿　傳染病統計　　　　一九三四年四月十四日午夜前一星期内患病及死亡人數表症别外僑居住租界華人内及租界外工　（人口約一、一部局道路（人　○○、四九六口約四八、三　人）二五人）患病經死亡患病經死亡報吿者人數　報吿者　人數</p>

<p>自由談摩登之破壞  徐懋庸　　宋朝有過這樣的摩登服裝··　　「宣和之季’京師士庶競以鵝黃爲腹圍’謂之「腰上黃」。婦人便服不施衿紐’束身短製’謂之「不製衿。」始自宫掖’未幾而通國皆服之。」　　「不施衿紐’束身短製」的那種婦人服’想像起來似乎比現在的摩登衣服還要摩登’一定是很好看的吧？但據說’亡了宋朝的就是這些服裝··　　「明年’徽宗内禪’稱上皇竟有靑城之邀’而金　亂華’卒於不能制也。斯亦服妖之比歟！」（程史）　　那時沒有摩登破壞團’所以那些「服妖」未遭厄運’若在今日’則也不免岌岌乎殆哉了。　　「國家將興’必有徵祥’國家將亡’必有妖孽。」服旣成妖’則國家之必亡可知。摩登破壞團之破壞摩登衣服’是除妖救國了也’厥功不可謂不偉。然而’國家之亡’與妖孽之生’其因果關係若何’我們還不得而知。假如國家之亡完全由於妖孽之生’則除妖誠可以救國。倘若’妖孽之生’根本由於國之將亡’則摩登破壞團也未免徒勞了。　　况且’服裝不過是妖孽身上的附屬物’並非妖孽的正體’若徒破壞了服裝’妖孽可以施金蟬脫殼計’現他種形相’依舊出來作祟。剪刀雖利’害不斷虚榮之念’鏹水雖烈’蝕不盡奢侈之慾。今之摩登生活’豈僅止於一襲外衣哉。摩登服裝若係「服妖」’則摩登男女所享受之一切物質’甚至彼等之思想舉止’何一而非妖？摩登破壞團豈能盡行破壞之乎？至於僅有一襲摩登外衣之人’當然也不少’但如某刋物所云’此類人之穿摩登衣服’「原是處於被動的地位’而迎合着享樂之人的心理’並以她們自己的肉去換來勉强穿在身上’以便於到人肉市塲競爭的’故此剪破了覺亦太殘忍。」　　按之實際’摩登之破壞’並不待摩登破壞團之動手’在摩登社會中’除了少數有產階級的男女’眞正過着享樂的摩登生活以外’其他多數的摩登模仿者’在精神上身體上實隨時受着自然的破壞。昔者「楚王好細腰’宫中多餓死’吳王好擊劍’宫中多瘢痕」’據某報說’今之摩登女郎’十九患寒腿病（或云旣係凍瘡’是則病名也摩登化了。）這種破壞’實遠較剪刀鏹水爲烈也。社戲  臧克家　　我不懂戲’所以我不喜歡戲。在都市裏’我很少看過戲’有’那便是爲了面子。有些人聽了戲匣子搖頭擺尾’眞呌我好笑。　　然而’鄕村裏的戲我確極愛看’那醇眞的趣味’我全嚋得透’它使人感興味的不在戲的本身而是那一種整個的空氣。譬如某一個村子要唱戲’沒有札臺子以前好些日子’便各人忙着搬親戚’從外祖母起一直到自己的女兒’女兒的小姑’幾世不走動了的親戚’因此也往來起來’有孩子的不消說要帶着看戲’就是不會看’哭哭鬧鬧也還熱鬧。客人决心要擾親戚了’就打算身上和頭上的穿帶’老太太無妨把做好的送老衣裳先穿出來試試。少婦們也把當年做新娘的那件禮服重新展覽一下’姑娘們當然更應該打扮得俊俏’粉擦得看不淸眉眼’無論如何少不了那一雙花鞋和那付紅腿帶。你不要笑’唱臺子戲不是輕易的呵。唱戲的日子以正月爲最好’天氣漸漸的暖了’這時候人也有個閒心’如果是因爲豐年唱戲「以答神庥」的話’那麽新正大月更是吉祥。對於社戲說「聽」不對’應該說是「看」’觀衆多得像海’人頭攢動着’你擁我’我擁你’不像波浪’擁來擁去的結果是來一個騷動’聲音眞像海灘。四圍全是車子’大車小車。每個大車都有篷子’表示着華貴’又表示着神秘。貴族的人家都扎着看台’看台竹簾中透出朦朧的女人的面影。在這樣的情况裏耳朶變成了廢物’只能用眼遠遠的看一些彩人兒在戲台上亂動。晌午停了戲’各人忙着和不容易見面的親友（戲使他們聚會了）去喝酒。還有姐夫領着小舅子’姑夫帶着妻姪到飯攤上去吃飯丨燒肉’火燒。吃完了再喝點茶水’然後用幾百錢或一串水煎包子便把這些小孩子遺散了。這樣在招待的方面感到了光榮’被招待的小孩子當然更喜之不盡了。　　那些喝酒的朋友們’用酒當談話的引子’幾年或幾十年積下來的話’這可得着個傾吐的時候了。話沒有說到極處’酒先使得人從鼻子裏出聲了。賣酒的拿來白水也會當酒呷下去的。戲開了的時候’這些醉人東斜西歪的在凉風裏擺’臉紅得像火燒。下午散戲’村旁四去的小路上把人們散開了’這時太陽快沾地了’風有點冷’觀衆在殘陽裏懷着個快樂的心’冒着冷風回家去了。　　最好還是看夜戲。吃過晚飯大家打一個招呼’便踏着月色走了。戲台四圍一萬點燈光。燈光映着一些好看的臉。朦朧中一些眼睛一些心在神秘的交語。散戲回來’夜已深了’脚步聲惹出了巷中的一陣犬吠。回家來’睡夢中’耳中還嚮着纙鼓。有些良善的女人會爲了悲劇中的英雄在燈下歎氣或一夜睡不好的。　　社戲是太平年代的點綴’鄕人勞苦一頓’這種娛樂比什麽味都深。然而太平年代　　會有了’社戲於今也不輕易見到’就是有’怕誰也沒有太平年代的那個心了！農人的命運今天已變成了悲劇’誰能用一雙餓着的眼睛去年戲呢？「　戲」這兩個字一提上口’人心下會不是味的！夜歸  愼之　　踏過闌珊的街頭’幽靈一般地望着街燈光落在河波’緩緩無力地閃流。　　踏進陰鬱的深巷’幽靈一般地浴着新月銀色的光輝’蕩漾出心底的感傷。　　拖起沉重的足跟’聽夜風低語步聲輕悄得有如幽靈’躡進空寞的院庭。西游目錄（四）  郁達夫　　東坡到臨安來訪琴操事’曾見於菜地裏的那一塊碑文之上。而毛子晋編的東坡筆記裏’也有一段記琴操的事情說··　　「蘇子瞻守杭日’有妓名琴操’頗通佛書’解言辭’子瞻喜之。一日遊西湖’戲語琴操曰··「我作長老’汝試參禪！」琴操敬諾。子瞻問曰··「何謂湖中景？」對曰··「落霞與孤鶩齊飛’秋水共長天一色」。「何謂景中人？」對曰··「裙拖六幅湘江水’　挽巫山一段雲。」「何謂人中意？」對曰··「隨他楊學士’　殺鮑參軍。」「如此究竟何如？」琴操不答’子瞻拍案曰··「門前冷落車馬稀’老大嫁作商人婦。」琴操言下在悟’遂削　爲尼。」　　這一段有名的東坡軼事’若不是當時好奇者之僞造’則關於琴操’合之前錄的馮詩’當有兩個　　好定’卽一’琴操或係臨安的這玲瓏山附近的巷中。　　我們這一羣色情狂者還在琴操墓前爭論得好久’纔下山來。再在玲瓏站上車’東駛回去’上臨安去吃完午飯’已經將近二點鐘了··飯後並且還上縣城東首的安　山（俗稱太廟山）下’去瞻仰了一回錢武肅王的陵墓。武肅王的的豐功偉烈’載在名册；除吳　備史之外’就是新舊臨安縣志’杭州府志等’記錢氏功業因緣的文字’也要占去大半；我在此地本可以不必再寫’但有二三瑣事’係出自我之猜度者’順便記牠一記’或者也可以镬一般研究史實者的考訂。　　錢武肅王出身市井’性格嚴刻’自不待言’故唐僧貫休呈　　　　　　　　　　　　　　詩’有一　　　十四　　　　及其衣錦還鄕’犬宴父老時’却又高歌　一斗牛無孛分民無欺」等語；酒酣耳熱’王又自唱吳歌娛父老曰··「汝輩免儂的歡喜’吳人與我别是一般滋味’子長在我心子裏。」則他的橫征暴歛’專制刻毒’大旨也還爲的是百姓’並無將公帑存入私囊去的傾向。到了他的末代忠懿王錢宏俶’還能薄取於民’使民墾荒田’勿收其稅’或請科賦者’杖之國門’也難怪得浙江民衆’要懷念及他’造保俶塔以資紀念了。還有一件事情’武肅王妃’每歲春必歸臨安’王遺妃書曰’「陌上花開’可緩緩歸矣。」吳人至用其語爲歌。我意此書’必係王之書記新城羅隱秀才的手筆’因爲語氣温文’的是詩人出口語也。　　自錢王墓下回來’又坐車至藻溪。換坐鞽子’向北行四十里而至西天目。因天已晚了’就在西天目山下的禪源寺内宿。「過去的幽靈」（續）  胡風　　「幽靈」（Ｙｕｌｅｉ）’不錯’在愛羅先珂用的日本語裏面’正是我們所說的「鬼」的意思’而他們所說的「鬼」（Ｏｎｉ）’却是陰間的不像人形的怪物。那麽’周先生現在自己所談的鬼’聽人家談的鬼’是不是當年他翻譯的時候呌我們防備的幽靈呢？昔日熱烈地呌人防備’現在却促膝而談之’不曉得是鬼們昔日雖然可惡而現在却可愛起來了呢’還是因爲昔日雖然像現在的批評家似地「浮燥」’而現在的八道灣居士却功成圓滿’就是對於小鬼也一視同仁了？或曰’周先生雖然逍遙世外但終不能忘掉「人問」’談鬼云者’不過是對於鬼域人間的一諷刺耳。那麽。就是「不將袍子換袈裟」也可以’我們還是希望八道灣居士對於一批一批「失足落水」的靑年們來一次超度的　脆以上都算瞎說。「旁人若問其中意’且到寒齋吃苦茶」’有心人頂好是買一張由上海到北京的聯票’在烟雨迷濛的八道灣上’穿過「胡麻」地’你可以找得到一座茅庵’祗須叩門’不用名刺’被小童迎接進去之後’你就可以聞到一陣茶香。至於在十里洋塲上出現的「人間世」’曁不「吟風弄月」’也不「玩物喪志」’祗是有點力求「精雅」’「談狐說鬼」而已。馬駄子們  謝飛白一　　他們踏着朝霧向山腰爬去’谷風吹得很緊’旅店的掛燈在濃霧裏閃成一團糢糊的昏暈’氣候寒冷得像西伯利亞嚴冬的曠野。　　今天得從這邊的山麓踏到那邊的山麓’在這終年凍着積雪的荒山裏’沿途是沒有投宿的所在的。　　每匹馬駄着一駄鹽’每個人也背着一背鹽’省會和山城間的距離’就賴着這種交通的運輸。十步以外便是霧海’那兒隱藏着怪石’險崖’强盜。人和畜的性命都是付託給天的。路被陳舊的雪凍得很乾燥’如果太陽照久時’路面溶解’走起來更會危險’各人在馬腿上抽了一鞭’想在午前爬上山頂。　　人喘着氣’馬也喘着氣’一出口腔’便凍縮在冷霧裏’馬鈴聲也像冷硬了’響得不大起勁。　　永恒的苦役呵’然而他們只得這樣苦役着’永恒地！　　爬上一個高坡’又降落一個深谷’鈴聲在霧裏發出顫聲。　　　二「當心！」右手高坡上一堆厚雪忽的崩落下來’一個老於旅途的人’同一匹老於旅途的馬’從左手崖邊被橫掃下去了’谷裏有一點回響。後面的人停止下來’發出一陣嘆息’崩雪過後’鈴聲又徐徐的響了。在這不知底的山谷裏’誰有本領去尋回一條毛哩？太陽從重霧裏突圍而出’殘餘的霧漸漸向山下捲去’四面只閃着亮晶晶的光芒’刺得人眼發痛’積雪溶解着。　　「他媽的’永世不要當馬駄子！」一個小伙子跌在濘泥裏’又爬起來’嘟噥着不。　　「快走呵’在後天就到家過年啦！」　　人和馬都有顆急於歸家的心哩。　　黃昏時’他們聽得見叱犢的聲音’一些漢子犂着野火燒過的山麓’預備春天播種。　　「要是我家的那頭牛不賣掉’要是王老板不把佃給我家的田收回·····唉’馬駄子不是人當的！」小伙子永遠嘟噥着。山坡下現出一條低矮的牆垣’人們都活潑起來’要落店啦！　　將近城門時’一羣灰色漢子迎接似的將繮繩從他們手裏奪去。　　「先生’我只一匹馬’鹽是王老板的’我一家人都靠這匹馬呵！」　　皮鞭在空氣裏劃了一個半圓’落在小伙子頭上’已經凍僵的耳朶’像忽的投進沸水裏。　　「鹽不要’馬要給本軍駄軍餉’混蛋’你不知道現在要開火嗎？」　　馬駄子們跟着灰色的人羣’默然向軍營走去。一個女人（四）  王越　　在起初的一些日子里’她這種荒凉的行動’頗引起主人們的不安’尤其是夜深人靜的時候’她慢騰騰地緩踱着’在那憧憧的陰影里’在那蒼白的路燈下面’好像永無止息似的。那個做夜工的縫工’曾經牙齒上掛着絲綫’把鼻尖貼在門窗的玻璃上’（因爲這里的屋子是沒有石庫門的）發愁地咭咕道··「眞要命！」但不久人們也就習慣了’好像習慣於他們寒儉的生活一樣的容易。她對於一切支使從不肯吝惜勞力’在他們’這就很滿足了。　　但在人們吩咐她作事的時候’不管那命令是出於纒綿的丁寗’或者威逼一般的催促’她在進行的速率上’老是保待着那種遲頓的調子’好像她是十分安於她那雜亂的衣着’和粗拙的身體給她造成的呆笨。她的眼勢也是呆笨的’昏暗’很少活氣。可是’由於自小是在泥土里長大起來的道個原故’她的身體却并不十分孱弱。而且’當一回那位善心的老太婆’那縫工的母親’出於一種哀憐’或者惡心’帮她大掃除了那汚濁的頭面之後’另一位中年婦人’還趁機表演了她的毒嘴。這是一個高大的婦人’很像一個北方大漢’她老是披着一件女學生的絨線背心’有的說她是個孀婦’有的人又說她只不過是同文夫分居了’而她現在正帶着六歲的女兒’和自己的小姨子過着甜蜜的生活。她把兩支手插在絨線背心的口袋裏’偏着頭打趣道··「喲’我倒還沒有看出來呀！」　　無疑地這是一個刻毒的反語’因爲那孀婦接着就很顯然地唾着惡心的口痰。而且在實際上’雖說經過了一回像樣的梳洗’年齡的標識已經在她的臉上有着顯著的變動了’而她却依舊是衰老而醜陋’那糜爛的惡瘡’也照樣地就擺在那當眼的地方’來嘲弄她的不幸’來引起人們的趨避和打嘔’丨一個失掉了人類的外形的人’她已經沒有資格使人引爲同類了····　　她在這裏停留得並不長久’三個月過後她就被人們驅逐了。但這不是由於她那外形的缺陷’倒是因爲她也具有着人類共同的要求。那是夜深的時候’主人們都已熟睡了’她一人獨自地在衖道上彳亍着’沉浸在一種内在的擾動裏面。她幾乎時常這樣’而許多不眠之夜’便從她那寂寞的鞋聲中消逝了。四近是無聲的’靠牆的路燈投下着微弱的光亮。出於一種不安的壓抑’她發呆似地走到衖口’讓自己的臉貼向那久已失職的鐵門上面。而正在這時候’一個矮矮的嘟噥着的人形’順着牆搖擺過來了。　　這是一個喝醉了酒的漢子’那附近草棚里的寄住者’他踉蹌着’發出着含混的責嚷。而且時時跳躍一般地轉過身去’躱着脚’揮着威脅的手勢’在更利害的呌嚎中夾着一種冷酷的乾笑。但當他走近門邊’發見了一個和他同樣襤褸的同伴的時候’他却突然地又變得萎縮而頽膺了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言文明人與文明國  家爲　　時代的巨輪永遠繼續不斷地轉輾着向前；不能免强作爲’也不得加以限制’陳朽的落伍的一切終得逐漸地’也有突然地被新的時代的所繼承’所替代。這種種’當然都須由自然的環境與歷史的客觀的條件來决定；而同時’得助於人類特有的「慧智」’科學的發達竟超越自然’而物質文明的發展也就一日比一日的迅速與繁榮起來了。若把今日我們周圍的一切物質丨人類也在其中丨比之在「人類進化史」和各種歷史上所記載的一切’那眞是不可同日而語了。但是旣須由自然的環境與歷史過程中客觀的社會關係所支配’因此這個發展’在這世界中竟成爲畸形的了。　　在歐美各國丨亞洲的「大日本」也須列入的吧丨因爲科學的發達’一切物質都得文明’而其人民也已開化（？）到無以復加。因此其國可尊之爲「文明國」’而其人民也得尊之爲「文明人」了。是的’這許多「文明人」確是可受人敬服’欣佩；看吧’他們有着複雜的腦脛’靈敏的知覺’高超的學識’圓滑的手腕····是他們在推着這「文明」往前（？）’是他們才明瞭怎可算爲「文明人」而懂得做文明人」··什麽是理性’禮讓’公德·····是他們才是這世界上最有權威而亦最「高貴的人們」咧？！　　但是在這地球上的其他各洲各國’因爲沒有受到「科學的洗禮」’或受之不足與無力’因此比之諸「文明國」實有「天壤之别」了。有的因爲地勢的關係而與外界（文明地）隔絕’因此還過着那「原始」的生活。他們的頭腦是簡單’他們的心靈是正直’他們不懂什麽是禮讓’理性···他們只懂得做他們所想而所能做的事’不加掩飾’奸僞·····但是他們只爲「文明人」所唾棄’甚至不齒’他們被稱爲「野蠻」；他們多半被「文明人」以「文明的利器」’「高明的手段」所征服而作他們的「奴隸」’「牛馬」丨「殖民地」的開拓丨他們是完全攝服在「文明人」的權威之下’被毫無顧恤地加以殘酷的暴行而不敢’亦不能呼吸’出聲···這種種事實’在過去的歷史過程上早有着不少熱鬧的悲壯的「名劇」出演了。我們有時也可以在電影銀幕上的圖面中（如最近的「菲洲果剛國」’「愛斯基摩」等片）認識這些「文明人」的眞實的性格··他們有着無恥’下賤的行爲’殘酷’狂暴的野性···但是他們可以把有利於他們的「文明」’正義’禮讓等等的美名來掩飾了’他們的「盧山眞面」；奸猾’欺詐’殘酷’自私···…　　某國一個有名的作家對「文明」有着這樣的一個比喻說··一　金玉外的怪美的文明’就像一座戰場一樣’你無論在那兒的地皮掘下一鋤頭’那你都要發現出恐怖’不堪入目的奇形’不堪入鼻的惡臭’都會使你病倒。一好了’現在我們來看看這個「地大物博」的自己吧！　　咱們中國’自受到各「文明國」的「科學洗禮」以來’也有多久的歷史了。因此一切得助於這許多「善親的文明人」而都「文明」起來了丨尤其是在各大都市’可不是嗎？在外觀上誰說不能與諸「文明國」相比呢？那末咱們同胞怎不能傚着「文明人」的種種而與之爲伍呢？但是我們且返身自檢一下吧！我國是否也得尊爲「文明國」呢？别夢想吧’朋友！你不見嗎？各「文明國」的「文明人」’虎視耽耽地包圍在你的四周幹麽呢？這塊肥胖的鮮美的「俎上肉」’已在開始着「瓜分」’你覺到了嗎？出過聲嗎？記得嗎？在「東北」’被「文明」的日本人割去一大塊「肥肉」時’在「文明國」裏’那「文明人」的報紙上對他們的「同志」丨日本丨大加贊助的宣揚’說日本是爲了反對中國的「野蠻’說他們才是「文明的保衛者」······朋友’在今日’旣處在「半殖民地」地位的「一個野蠻人」得想與一個「文明人」爲伍嗎？咄咄！　　聰明的朋友們！「文明人原來如此」’又得到一次認識了。本來’每一個局部的細小的問題’也得連繫在全部的整個的問題之下的。在「下回」丨整個的丨沒有「分解」以前’我們將行作怎樣的凖備’淸理泥？亭子間作家  一蘋　　亭子間作家埋頭苦幹’寫出一部鉅著「戀愛破滅論」’在某刋物上發表之後’他就混進了一個什麽團體’更洋洋乎大觀的談起「五十年來之中國」。這野人頭居然出售’博得大部人們的擁護’亭子間作家的大名也被風吹一般的頌揚起來’自有某部長以優厚的薪金聘爲私人秘書。　　春風吹到人間的一天’亭子間作家依依不捨的離别了他五年來相依爲命的故居’遷進了七十兩一月的洋房住宅。咱們作家自然不再穿着落拓時的破西裝了。走路將昂着頭的踏進會客室’他效學着名人的態度’鞠躬至謝一般恭賀喬遷之喜的良朋嘉賓。晚上更大排筵席’每個人都微笑着開懷暢飲；就是從前駡過亭子間作家是某人的走狗的’這時候也大作家大文豪的恭維他。咱們的作家也忘也大雪天徒步到朋友家裏挨上門吃飯的故事’他擎起酒杯向來賓請啊請啊的喊’賓主盡歡而散是不言可喻的。　　某部長的私人秘書是最賺錢不吃力的職位。部長不到ＸＸ去’亭子間作家可以不必上衙門。部長有事’搖一個電話來請他’每個月也不會有二三次以上的。所以他除了他公私應酬之外’努力於編譯「五十年來之中國」之餘’他的稿件各處都有’雖然編輯先生曾把他的稿件原封未動的塞進過字紙簏’現在是祗要署上他的名字的’稿酬特别從豐。　　　　亭子間作家的進益日增’他想起了一件從前悶煩得拚命抽烟的大事來。　　惱人眠不得的春宵’一輛出差汽車將較從前重了二十磅的咱們作家送進跳舞塲。這裏有醉人的音樂’迷人的肉體’他像喝醉了酒一般的摟着舞毁女狂跳。那妖媚的眼睛’微聳的胸部’他迷茫的在白熱的空氣中’淴土耳其浴一般的不知自己的存亡’於是亭子間作家詩興勃發··　　春風你爲甚吹動了我底心’　　春風我的心動了······　　膩舞’狂歡’東方發白的時候’微笑的舞女依然疲乏了的’咱們作家懷中被汽車帶回小洋房。　　洋房中的空氣濃馥’温香’笑聲蕩漾着’「五十年來之中國」的原稿在舞女的塗了寇丹的玉指間作蝴蝶的　躚舞’亭子間作家擁了她半裸的肉體貪婪地笑着’他毫不顧惜他心血的結晶化爲流水。　　他從此不喊窮、不喊煩悶’「戀愛破滅論」雖登着出單行本的預約廣吿’而「五十年來之中國」永遠沒有完稿的時候。業餘信箱驅逐劣父編者先生··　　自本欄設立後’每見讀者中挾有疑難問題者’一一得有圓滿之辦法以解决；尤其是前日答覆之「一家生命」判析得縧縷畢見’令人敬佩萬分！茲鄙夫亦有一關於「一家生命」之問題’請求指示一條出路’不謹鄙人一人感德’而亦「一家生命」胥蒙福利焉。謹以至誠’焚香禱求之矣。　　吾家世居吳門’祖父以紗緞業起家、當沅復以前’爲全盛時代出產行銷國内外’生活以是稍裕’於是身染黑籍··而父親生當盛時’不事生產’白惟遊蕩’遂亦陷黑籍。民八後’國内市塲’漸爲嗶嘰侵去’國外亦不能行銷’卽僅有之朝鮮紗銷路’亦爲日本定稅値百抽百之重征被擯；於是營業日見衰敗’而一方父親變本加厲’沉陷烟賭’所求不遂’輒私自取貨’質錢化用；祖父不得已’將營業漸行收束範圍’終於停歇。後將父親置之於習藝所’冀其感化；越時六載’父親自行設法而出’祖父以其已受一番經歷’或能自新’故未之阻。初出之時’頗自振作’僅早茶粗飯而已··乃不一年’故態復萌。三年前’此攸關「一家生命」源泉之祖父’竟一病不起。連年婚喪大故’積資漸罄’而父親仍不顧家艱’日惟吞雲吞霧’向祖母母親予取予求。母親近以兒輩漸長’恐其少不遂意’又復肯年行爲’（典衣質物）重見今日’故皆隱忍與之；致今日家庭經濟狀况’已處山窮水盡之境地矣。一家大小七口’（除兄弟三人在外不計）衣食一應等費’僅恃房租收入以維持’然仍不敷若干’母親意欲令由鄙人等寄資挹注’然鄙人兄弟等收入有限’（各僅十餘元二十元左右不等）自顧不足’安有餘力以負担耶？况吾家經濟狀况’雖覺窘迫’然菜飯布衣’固猶可恃房租收入以維持也。（前之所云不足者’因一部份房租歸由父親取用之故）然父親若長此以往’仍不戒烟者’祖母手中百年之需’亦必陸續化去’此後負担’胥在鄙人等身上。試問’我等何以堪此！一方家庭正當日用’窘迫異常’不能展舒；同時鄙人等荷此負担’力竭聲嘶’有時不繼’卽有斷炊之虞。是以函請母親婉辭懇勸父親戒烟’戒除之後’除去個人茶點另資’餘數移之家用’則不致衣食不舉矣。奈執迷不悟’聲言「家事不顧’吃烟至死方休一。嗟乎！生公說法’頑石點頭’獨生父而竟如斯！爲人子者’能不悲乎！恨不能身付淸流’了却煩惱</p>

<h3>President Wang's Report on Internal and Foreign Affairs at the National Government Memorial Week: The Fundamental Strength of Diplomacy Still Lies in the Nation Itself; The True Meaning of the New Life Movement is Psychological Suppression of Bandits</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week on the morning of the 16th, attended by more than 600 people including Zhang Ji, Chen Gongbo, He Yaotsu, Chen Shaokuan, Deng Jiayan, Li Yuanding, Chen Qicai, Chen Ce, Cao Haosen, Wei Huai, Lü Chao, and officials from various ministries and commissions. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, President Wang made a report, the original text of which is as follows: (1) The most important issue discussed with Chairman Chiang and Mr. Huang Yingbai in Nanchang this time was the current situation in North China. For the past two years, North China has been in an extremely dangerous situation, but it is not without solutions. If we can improve politics, rectify military discipline, and spiritually awaken the people to unite and save themselves, and materially relieve the rural areas, it may not be enough to sustain the crisis. Even if success or failure cannot be predicted, the strength of the nation will eventually manifest itself. As for diplomacy, we should carefully consider the international situation and the general trend in East Asia to respond effectively, but the fundamental strength still lies in the nation itself. (2) The bandit suppression in Jiangxi is indeed making progress. Since the training in Lushan last year, the morale of the local soldiers has been greatly boosted. Everyone is confident that they have a good grasp of the bandit suppression, and the strategy for bandit suppression is also focusing on steady progress, first preventing the spread, second reducing the bandit areas, and third completely eradicating them. (3) The true meaning of the New Life Movement in Nanchang is to go a step further beyond military suppression of bandits, political suppression of bandits, and economic suppression of bandits to achieve psychological suppression of bandits. The principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are specifically designed to eliminate inhumanity and promote bestiality in bandit areas, and to prescribe the right medicine for the disease. As for the basic conditions of the New Life Movement, it should be to accept the inherent good morals of China and promote them, and add to them the spirit of modern social reform movements, in order to create a collectivized and disciplined national society. (4) The issue of the demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma border is being jointly carried out by the General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to a report from Chairman Long of Yunnan, the incident occurred in Pan Hong, which is within the Yellow Line and therefore within Yunnan's territory. However, according to the reply from the British representative, it occurred in Pan Long, which is outside the Yellow Line and therefore within Burma's territory. According to a recent report from Chairman Long, the location of the incident was Lufang, seven miles outside the Yellow Line. However, whether the location of the incident was only in Lufang, and whether there were any intrusions within the Yellow Line other than Lufang, remains to be investigated. Therefore, the General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are now jointly sending personnel to conduct on-site surveys, and are working closely with the Yunnan Provincial Government. The relationship between China and Britain has always been friendly, and the issue of the demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma border is a long-standing issue. Resolving it is a matter of urgency and will also benefit our diplomatic relations. It is a good phenomenon that the people of our country are paying attention to this and discussing it, but it is not appropriate to make deliberately激昂 remarks to provoke emotions and ignore reason. As for the claim that British troops have occupied Lancang County, it is even more absurd. (5) The China-Turkey treaty is beneficial to the friendship between China and Turkey. We sincerely hope that the friendship between China and Turkey will continue to improve.</p>

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Returns to Beiping from Sui; Trip to Xinjiang Postponed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Ping from Sui at 9:30 AM on the 16th, and met with He Yingqin in the evening to discuss Mongolian affairs. According to Huang, after arriving in Sui, he felt unwell, and because the Sun affair had been resolved, there were too many scattered soldiers and vagrants, and the local area was not peaceful. The Yellow River had also thawed, so he could not travel west. He returned to Beiping to rest for a while, and would go to Sui later after the Northwest battlefield had been cleared up. He will also go to Shaanxi and Gansu to meet with President Dai. Yang Hou's small bandits still number over two thousand and are currently located more than one hundred li southwest of Bailing Temple, not yet out of Sui territory. The Ministry has already deployed a tight defense and is conducting encirclement and suppression. His task concerning the Mongolian autonomous affairs is complete and he will no longer be involved. He does not know who will be appointed as the guiding officer of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, so he will not participate in its establishment. The situation in Xinjiang is chaotic, but because news is blocked, the situation is unclear. He could not go because the roads were difficult to travel. As for the situation in North China, he has just arrived in Ping from the interior and cannot report. Finally, Huang also said that since the war in western Sui, there have been hundreds of li without inhabitants, and the bones of cattle, horses, and sheep are everywhere. The local authorities are organizing spring relief, and the central government has allocated funds to facilitate relief efforts. (Sixteenth Special Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Chaisan Returns to Ping from Jin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Shan returned to Ping from Datong at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 16th. According to him, he traveled in Shanxi and Hebei for a week. He felt that Shanxi has coal everywhere, but few people mine it. The stone Buddhas of Tianlong Mountain have been completely destroyed, while the scale of Yungang still remains. This will inevitably affect the culture of your country. He met with Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying when he passed through Zhang yesterday. Song Zheyuan was on patrol, so he did not meet him. Sakagaki and Nishimura have gone to Baotou for sightseeing. (Sixteenth Special Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Problem of Withdrawal of Pseudo-Police from Gubeikou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of the withdrawal of the pseudo-police from Nantianmen in Gubeikou is still stalled. Liu Youxun returned to Gu on the morning of the 16th at 8:00 AM. (Sixteenth Special Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Conduct Combat Exercises</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7:00 AM this morning, Japanese troops in Tianjin and Ping conducted combat exercises. The morning was a battle for control, and the afternoon was an engagement battle. The Tianjin and Ping troops alternately attacked and defended, with Fengtai as the target of the struggle. The exercises concluded at 5:00 PM. (Sixteenth Special Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Privately Deliver Mail; Tianjin Authorities Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>(Dalian) The Tianjin Chinese authorities recently protested strongly to the Japanese Consul General because the steamships of the Dalian Steamship Company sailing from Tianjin to Manchuria were carrying mail with Japanese stamps. Today, a certain Japanese official of the Dalian Post Office said that mail from Chinese ports with Japanese stamps is regarded as "ship mail," meaning that it is carried by the captain or sailors. Each ship of the Dalian Steamship Company sailing from Tianjin carries two to three hundred letters and packages, while those from Shanghai average about one thousand to one thousand five hundred. All are distributed by the Dalian Post Office. It is also said that of the "ship mail" from Tianjin, two-thirds have Japanese stamps, while those from Shanghai are only about one-fifth. All those without Japanese stamps have Chinese stamps. Before the 1922 Washington Conference, Japan had established post offices in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Letters with Japanese stamps could be sent to Dalian and other places along the South Manchuria Railway. After the signing of the Washington Treaty, the Japanese post offices in China were closed in accordance with the treaty. Therefore, mail sent from Chinese ports should nominally have Chinese stamps.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Seeking to Reveal the Crisis of the National Economy After Reading the 1933 Annual Report of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>The 1933 Annual Report of the Bank of China has now been published. The full text was published in yesterday's newspaper. In terms of the nature of the report, it was originally made by Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank, to the General Meeting of Shareholders as usual to report on the business operations over the past year, in order to show the business direction determined by the bank and to enable shareholders to understand the relationship between the bank and the social economy. However, because of the position of the bank in the current Chinese financial organization, it is slightly different from ordinary commercial banks, and the content of its report is very broad. Therefore, it is also possible for us to regard it as a description of the history of China's national economy in the past year, rather than as a business report of a private company to its shareholders.</p>
<p>In terms of the compilation of the report, we do not need to regard it as a work that is credible and evidenced in terms of the listing of figures and the way of presentation. For example, the report points out that the total revenue of the central government in 1933 was more than 680 million yuan, while the expenditure was more than 828 million yuan. It did not explain that this figure was only a general estimate of the central government of the current government. From this, we can know that the actual deficit of the central revenue and expenditure of the current government, the so-called constant at around 140 million, can still only make us understand this mystery. If we ask the financial authorities of our country, I am afraid that they may not be able to tell us immediately. This is caused by the chaos of the financial system, which is beyond the ability of the bank's authorities. However, what we must understand is that the bank, as a private company, is able to pay attention to the relationship between the bank and the social economy of this country, and to shout loudly and raise the crisis of the national economy to warn the people of the country. This is indeed rare. What I want to ask is that with today's generally disorganized and numb society, to promote it in order to save this imminent end, saying that it is not a hopeless place, then where is the way? Even if there is a way to save this end, whether it can be realized and whether it can be effective cannot help but make people doubtful.</p>
<p>We believe that the most noteworthy thing in the report is the two paragraphs on the consolidation of the controlled industry and the soundness of finance. From the former paragraph, the report points out that China does not have a sound currency system, so it has the good laws and good intentions of Europe and the United States that cannot be transferred to China. This argument is actually specious. The sound currency system is based on the sound national economic organization. The report does not clearly tell us that the currency system under imperialist aggression has no way to be sound, giving the people of the country a correct understanding, and paying attention only to the improvement of currency administration is not a fundamental statement. From the latter paragraph, the report points out the current financial crisis. One is the government's excessive abuse, the second is the sharp shrinkage of national income, and the third is the expansion of foreign direct investment in China. This is deeply agreed by us. The current central budget revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced due to unproductive consumption. The shrinking of the national income is due to the encroachment of foreign forces. The so-called feudal remnants and the trampling of imperialism can be realistically stated in the report, so that they are fully reflected in the eyes of the people of the country and arouse the vigilance of the people of the country. After reading the report, we believe that the crisis of the national economy, which has been fully pointed out in the report, is already clearly in sight. However, how to seek fundamental relief has not been mentioned at all. Will there only be groaning and no effort? If the way of relief is the work of the government, then are proactive proposals not urgent and needed at present? This is indeed still waiting for the efforts of our banking community and the people of the whole country.</p>

<h3>Unfavorable International Situation Temporarily Delays Japanese Attack on Russia; US Observers Believe Crisis Has Not Passed; Japan is Consolidating its Power in China; Fuyi's Usurpation Has Dual Meaning</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the opinions of many senior military and diplomatic observers here today, Japan seems to be determined to consolidate its power in China and Manchuria. Therefore, there is hope for a relaxation of the war situation in the Far East. Furthermore, according to numerous well-informed sources, the long-rumored Russo-Japanese War may not break out this spring. According to the current situation, the so-called inevitable Russo-Japanese War may be delayed for several years, which is also possible. However, the atmosphere from Tokyo to Moscow is still full of tension. The danger in the Siberia area does have the potential to trigger a global conflict. Therefore, no one dares to say that the crisis has passed. Leaders of Japan and Russia are now trying to reduce the risk of war, so the trend towards relaxation is clearly visible. Military observers used to believe that Japan regarded the industrialization of Soviet Russia as a challenge to Japan's hegemony in the Far East, so it planned to take preemptive action before the Soviet Russian forces were consolidated, and set March as the launch period, taking advantage of the warm season of spring, summer and autumn to attack Soviet Russia. However, most experts here do not think so now. There are three reasons: (1) Soviet Russia has now deployed heavy troops and military supplies on the Manchurian border, including more than 100,000 troops and 500 aircraft. In addition, there are also accumulations of tanks, heavy artillery, military grain, and munitions, and double tracks have been laid in many places on the Trans-Siberian Railway. (2) World opinion does not approve of Japan's provocative behavior, which has caused an atmosphere unfavorable to Japan psychologically and diplomatically. Soviet Russian politicians, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, American speakers, etc., are all figures who have created this atmosphere. (3) Japanese leaders now seem to be focusing their efforts on developing "Manchukuo" and its relationship with China, and Puyi's enthronement has two meanings: one is to consolidate the power of "Manchukuo", and the other is to threaten North China. Most experts believe that Japan intends to increase its power in China to suppress Soviet Russia, because if Japan can obtain new rights in China, Soviet Russia will be powerless. The current war can be avoided, and this kind of behavior can be obtained without fighting. Moreover, if Japan can use China's cheap labor, it can also economically defeat the commercial competition of the West and Soviet Russia. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Foreign Policy Association issued a statement today, warning about the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference, saying that if Japan and the United States do not change their policies, the conference will likely fail. The statement stated that if Japan insists on changing the existing 5:5:3 naval ratio and tries to obtain a higher ratio, and the United States refuses to recognize the puppet state of Manchuria, then the future Naval Disarmament Conference will have little hope of reaching mutual understanding. If the conference results in a breakdown, Japan and the United States will inevitably compete to build warships as much as possible, and the naval ratio limit will be broken, which will affect other countries. Therefore, if the Washington Conference fails, the consequences will be disastrous. Japan and the United States should be cautious about issues affecting the overall situation in the Far East.

<h3>Australia Takes the Opportunity to Negotiate Directly to Solve the Problems of Trade and Exchange of Ambassadors</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Australian Special Envoy and Foreign Minister Latham is scheduled to arrive in Nagasaki on May 8. Although his apparent mission is to promote Japan-Australia friendship, it is actually because Japan's imports from Australia currently exceed 100 million yuan per year. The Australian government believes that at a time when the trade relationship between Britain and Japan is not smooth, it is necessary to seek future understanding on Japan-Australia trade. Therefore, it has sent the powerful cabinet member Latham to Japan, so the two negotiations on the conclusion of a Japan-Australia trade treaty and the exchange of ambassadors can be materialized due to the Foreign Minister's visit to Japan. The Japanese government also regards this as an excellent opportunity to adjust the previous one-sided trade between Japan and Australia and expects the talks with the Foreign Minister to a great extent. Foreign Minister Hirota said that exchanging ambassadors is the best way to strengthen the close relationship between Japan and Australia through friendship and trade, so this matter will definitely make rapid progress this time. In the same sense, Foreign Minister Hirota hopes that after the signing of the Japan-India trade treaty is completed, the Indian side will send a powerful minister such as Buya, the Trade Commissioner, to Japan.

<p>Murai, the former Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, arrived here today to take up his post as Consul General in Australia and New Zealand. Murai stated that Japan has no intention of political aggression or military conquest of the Pacific. This idea has never been in the minds of Japanese leaders. Japan does not covet Australia and New Zealand and wants its land for colonization, because Japan is currently occupied with Manchuria and has no time to look south. Soviet Russia is a dangerous object, but Japan neither wants to conquer Russia nor unilaterally conquer China. Although Japan is currently engaged in military preparations, this is purely for national defense purposes. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Exerts Efforts to Befriend the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Cherry Blossom Festival will be held at the Burton Park starting on Friday. Many people from the Atlantic coast will go to enjoy the flowers. There are hundreds of cherry trees in the park, which were given by Japan to show its goodwill to the United States forty years ago. Since Japan occupied Manchuria, the hostility between the United States and Japan has been very deep. Recently, since Secretary of State Hull and Foreign Minister Hirota exchanged letters, this kind of psychology in Washington has no longer existed, but people still feel uneasy about the uncertain future. Political observers believe that Japan has repeatedly expressed its friendship with the United States and has repeatedly sent goodwill envoys to the United States, which is Japan's eagerness to promote the relationship between Japan and the United States.</p>

<h3>Minister of the Army Hayashi's Continued Tenure is Due to the Support of the Military</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito paid a visit to the Emperor this morning to report on the process of Minister of the Army Hayashi's retention. Furthermore, the Ministry of the Army held an informal military council meeting at 10:00 AM this morning to report on the matter of Minister of the Army Hayashi's retention. (16th Japan Federation Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Minister of the Army Hayashi submitted his resignation, his intention to resign was quite strong, and he refused all entreaties to stay. However, the result of the Three Chiefs Conference on the 15th dispelled his intention to resign and decided to retain him. It is reported that the situation leading to his retention is as follows: (1) After Minister of the Army Hayashi submitted his resignation, the government considered the successor, but due to various complicated circumstances, it was unable to decide, and various parties began to mobilize, making it difficult to weigh the qualifications of the successor. (2) The Minister of the Army took office during the Diet session. Although there were various problems such as the separation of the military and the people and the military's interference in politics, he gained the sympathy of the world and clearly expressed the military's policy at the Division Commander Conference, which won the trust of the Ministry of the Army. (3) The army has important matters to carry out national defense work due to the serious international situation. At this important moment, the Minister of the Army's resignation cannot be approved. Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in also persuaded him to stay, so the Minister of the Army decided to stay. (16th Japan Federation Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because Minister of the Army Hayashi, in view of the importance of the current situation, decided to dispel his intention to resign, the government decided to proceed in accordance with the policy decided by the cabinet meeting on the 10th in order to overcome the difficulties of the current situation. Prime Minister Saito will announce the government's important policies at the local governor's conference to be held on the 4th of next month, especially sorting out finances, tax system, renewing education, and establishing rural countermeasures, and explain the specific methods. Although the government has gained temporary stability because Minister of the Army Hayashi dispelled his intention to resign, the issue of appointing a Minister of Education, the issue of Minister of Justice Oyama's complaint, and a certain incident of a certain official have not been resolved, and the future is not optimistic. The current cabinet, which advocates unity and strives to move forward, has not achieved complete stability. (16th Japan Federation Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Urges Passage of Bill to Allow Congress to Meet on the 15th</h3>
<p>(Washington) After holding a day-long meeting with Senate leaders, President Roosevelt held another meeting with House leaders today. It is believed that today's meeting may extend until late at night. The purpose of the meeting is still to process bills and draft a concrete plan to allow Congress to adjourn in mid-May. President Roosevelt is particularly concerned with the early passage of the tariff bill in order to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements with foreign countries. He also hopes that the Securities Exchange Management Act will be established. The President believes that these two bills are very important in the congressional agenda, while the ordinary tax bill is only regarded as a routine matter. However, the current tax bill is not the case, because the bill aims to increase estate taxes and income taxes for the wealthy, and there are many plans to prevent the wealthy from evading taxes, so the content is unusually thorough. Although both the House and Senate have passed the tax bill, there are significant disagreements between the two chambers on several points, which can only be decided after the joint conference of the two chambers. This year's tax bill is completely different in nature from previous bills, so the President must first study it and then send it to the joint committee of the House and Senate. The House leaders can also use this to determine the President's attitude towards the bill. The President did not approve the clause on taxing coconut oil at 3%, because it would seriously affect the economic situation of the Philippine Islands. It is believed that President Roosevelt has sent a message to Congress on the war debt issue, stating that the government is willing to discuss the reduction of war debts and the reduction of import taxes on goods from debtor countries together.

<p>(Washington) After a three-hour meeting with House leaders at the White House today, President Roosevelt released his views on various silver bills. According to participants, the President had no intention of rejecting the Dai Tu bill, according to which the United States would accept silver at a high price as payment for purchasing American surplus agricultural products. However, the President opposes the mixed silver bill because it makes silver nationalized. Participants continued that the President has not changed his opposition to the Curt-Schiros bill, which advocates establishing a monetary reserve bureau to replace the Federal Reserve Bank to control the issuance of currency. If prices are 5% higher or lower than the standard price within a year, the bureau has the right to increase or decrease the gold content of gold coins. It is said that the President requested the House to pass the specific plan agreed upon by the Senate leaders on Saturday and Sunday. House Majority Leader Bean predicted that the House would accept the President's views and adjourn on May 15, but it is still a question how the Senate will react. According to Senator Thomas today, many members of Congress will be invited to participate in the parliamentary meeting on April 13 to seek to reconcile the views of all factions and pass a simple currency bill.

<h3>Japan's National Debt Exceeds 8 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Finance, as of the end of March this year, the total amount of Japan's current national debt is expected to exceed 8 billion yuan, reaching 8,139,039,000 yuan, an increase of 1,084,843,000 yuan compared with 7,054,195,000 yuan in the same period last year. The estimated amount of bonds to be issued this year is 1 billion yuan, so the national debt this year will exceed 9 billion yuan. If added to the increased rice certificates and short-term securities, it can completely reach 10 billion yuan. (16th Japan Federation Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Germany Will Stop Paying War Debts, and the Allied Powers Encounter a New Difficult Situation; Foreign Currency Reserves in National Banks Decrease Daily; The Young Plan Will Be Completely Shelved</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Frankfurter Zeitung predicted today that Germany will completely stop paying debts under the Dawes and Young Plans, saying that Germany will inevitably declare to the creditor countries that restricting future payments is unavoidable, and no debt will be an exception. The reason is that the foreign currency reserves in the German National Bank are decreasing daily. Germany will announce this intention at the meeting of German creditors in Berlin on April 27. If Germany stops paying its debts as the newspaper said, then the Allied Powers will encounter a difficulty. The Dawes Plan was a plan proposed by the Dawes and other expert committees based on Germany's financial situation and ability to pay reparations. It was later replaced by the Young Plan, which stipulates that Germany will pay back war debts in installments each year and pay them into the International Clearing Bank, using ordinary German commercial bonds as collateral and German railways as its source of payment. It also stipulates that 17,079,000 marks will be paid in 1930, and gradually increased each year for 35 years. It is estimated that 24,288,000 marks must be paid in 1965, but after 1965, it will not gradually decrease. 16,077,000 marks will be paid in 1966, and only 8,978,000 marks will be paid by 1987. The difference between the Young Plan and the Dawes Plan is that it specifically stipulates the amount to be paid each year, rather than determining the amount to be paid based on the prosperity of the country, and stipulates that Germany has financial autonomy, and any plan must be attached to foreign supervision.

<h3>Europe Unlikely to Have War Due to Vast Disparity in Military Strength</h3>
<p>(Geneva) General diplomatic observers in Geneva believe that Europe is unlikely to experience immediate warfare. The outbreak of war stems from conflicts between two countries. According to observations, no two European countries are currently engaged in active military buildup preparing for a decisive battle. Diplomats state that while the fate of Europe is in the hands of those who generally advocate for war, any schoolchild knows that no two or many countries are willing to be the initiator of conflict. Each country deeply understands that without a united alliance, it cannot inflict a fatal blow on Germany. All countries know that Hitler is by no means a fool and would not drive the German people into the hands of slaughter. Moreover, should any two countries initiate war, ceasing the turmoil in Europe would not be a momentary affair. Considering the military strength of France and its allies, can Germany truly defeat them? This is difficult to predict. However, if Germany is unwilling to wage war, war cannot occur. Examining the map of Europe, it is evident that Germany has many enemies but few friends. It is surrounded on three sides by France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Therefore, Germany cannot fight any country alone. If these three countries unite against Germany, it will be defeated in a matter of weeks. If Italy allies with Germany against France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania will undoubtedly rise up against Italy. Thus, even the combined forces of Germany and Italy are far inferior to the united front of France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania. France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries can deploy 50,000 allied troops, supported by machine guns. However, according to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is only permitted to deploy 2,000 troops. Even if Germany were to mobilize a large army on a temporary basis, it would be incapable of achieving anything. In terms of artillery, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia can deploy 7,000 units, while Germany is only allowed 300 units. Although Italy can supply Germany with 2,000 units, the total number for those three countries, plus the 2,400 units contributed by Yugoslavia and Romania, is still vastly disparate. The three countries can deploy 5,000 tanks, while Germany is prohibited from using this type of vehicle. If Italy and Germany assist each other, Italy can provide Germany with 150 tanks, but this is still vastly disparate compared to the number added by Yugoslavia and Romania. Regarding the air force, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have a total of 4,400 military aircraft, while Yugoslavia and Romania have a combined 700 aircraft. In terms of troops, Germany has a formal army of 100,000, but if war breaks out, a million trained soldiers will join. Furthermore, even in peacetime, according to German reports, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have a combined standing army of one million, which can be expanded to nine million in wartime. Italy has five million, but this is still considerably disparate compared to the number added by Yugoslavia and Romania. Therefore, under any circumstances, it is extremely difficult for Germany to wage war against France and its allies, unless Poland and Czechoslovakia stand idly by, in which case Germany might have a chance to fight France alone. Hence, according to the opinion of Geneva diplomats, a major war in Europe is unlikely to occur in the short term. Based on their observations, a major war seems more likely to break out in the Far East and then spread to Europe.</p>

<h3>France Seeks Friendship with Bulgaria; New Balkan Convention to be Drafted</h3>
<p>Sofia: According to the local newspaper, "New Era", Bulgaria is likely to be invited to sign a new Balkan non-aggression pact. This pact is entirely different from the Balkan Entente previously signed in Athens. It is drafted based on the spirit of the Polish-German non-aggression pact. The initiation of this pact seems to originate from France. Recently, during Bulgarian Prime Minister Mushanov's visit to France, he discussed this issue extensively with French Foreign Minister Barthou. However, according to the French newspaper, the formal proposal was put forth by Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, who presented it to Bulgarian Prime Minister Mushanov, who agreed. Judging from the recent warm reception Mushanov received in Paris, France's attitude towards Bulgaria has evidently become friendly. This is partly due to the visit of Minister without Portfolio Herriot to Bulgaria last August. Since then, major European countries have increasingly sympathized with Bulgaria. It is also reported that Greek Foreign Minister Maximos, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, and the authorities in Yugoslavia are all willing to start negotiations immediately to resolve outstanding issues between their respective countries and Bulgaria.

<h3>de Valera Proposes Abolition of Senate</h3>
<p>Dublin: The full text of the bill to abolish the Senate, proposed by Eamon de Valera, President of the Irish Free State, in Parliament on March 22, was published today. The plan intends to delete all references to the Senate and bicameral legislature from Article 16 of the Constitution. If the bill passes, events passed by Parliament will naturally become law. Therefore, it is expected that de Valera does not want to replace the Senate with another body. The opposition party strongly opposed the introduction of the bill, but it was eventually approved by a vote of 57 to 43. When introducing the bill, de Valera stated that the Senate, in its current form, seems to be detrimental to the country. The Senate's rejection of the Blueshirts Bill was deliberately obstructing the government from fulfilling its responsibilities. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Trotsky's Whereabouts a Secret</h3>
<p>Paris: Leon Trotsky, the exiled Soviet Russian leader, recently sneaked into Paris and was discovered by the police. It is reported that Trotsky and his wife left here before dawn today in a curtained car, destination unknown.</p>
<p>(Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The recent appearance of the exiled Russian leader Leon Trotsky in France has aroused great attention from the French public. Right-wing newspapers have heavily criticized the authorities, saying that France should not harbor poisonous scorpions to create future troubles. The "Echo de Paris" stated that for such dangerous revolutionaries, why should they be given unprecedented privileges to establish the Fourth International? This must be investigated legally. "Le Matin" criticized Interior Minister Chautemps for not allowing Trotsky to reside in France. However, left-wing newspapers expressed sympathy for the authorities, saying that the complaints of various newspapers were baseless. "L'Humanité" regretted the publication of the fugitive's whereabouts. It is generally expected that the authorities will ask Trotsky to find another place to live.</p>
<h3>Turkish Ambassador to Germany Dies Suddenly</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Sami, was admitted to a Berlin hospital for abdominal illness and surgery. It was initially thought that he would recover easily, but he suddenly died in the hospital today. The ambassador was 49 years old. During the European War, he served in the Army General Staff. When the Allied forces occupied Constantinople, he happened to be in the city and hid in a private residence. After several months, he devised a plan to escape to Asia Minor on an Italian ship. After the war, he returned to his country and entered the diplomatic field. He served as the Ambassador to Germany from 1925 until his death. It is regrettable that Turkey has lost a capable talent.

<h3>India Seeking to Arrest a Strange Man</h3>
<p>Peshawar: The Indian government is offering a reward of 1,000 British pounds for the arrest of a strange man named Amin Jan, who claims to be a cousin of the former Afghan King Amanullah and has the right to inherit the throne. He has recently been engaged in propaganda against the government. The Indian government is now eager to stop this propaganda to prevent a recurrence of last year's border unrest. Last year, a madman who was associated with Amin Jan stirred up trouble on the border, encouraging various tribes to support Amin Jan. Later, British aircraft distributed an "Ultimatum," ordering the tribal leaders to recall those who had joined. The unrest subsided. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>French Civil Servants Demonstrate Against Government Pay Cuts</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, civil servants in 140 French cities held demonstrations against the government's pay cuts. The demonstrations were peaceful. Tomorrow, they will demonstrate within government agencies to express their dissatisfaction, but only by stopping work for a few minutes. Most organizations, such as teachers' unions, only signed resolutions to protest. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, civil servants across France demonstrated against the government's pay cuts. The authorities took strict precautions, and fortunately, no incidents occurred. The Minister of Interior ordered local civil administrators not to meet with representatives of the demonstrators who intended to present the resolutions they had passed. Therefore, when representatives went to visit, they were told that the administrators were out on official business. Several dozen employees have been fired from the Paris Central Telegraph Office and its branches due to the demonstrations. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Labor unions have recently organized demonstrations to protest against the government's reduction of civil servants' salaries. However, this movement is controlled by unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, which advocates for gradual and orderly demonstrations rather than radical actions. Therefore, although extremists want to expand the movement, it is difficult for them to achieve their goals. This morning, various civil servants in Paris and the provinces stopped work for half an hour. In addition, civil servants, such as school teachers, only signed protest letters to express their opposition to the government's request for civil servants to sacrifice their interests in order to balance the budget. Currently, postal workers are the most radical, as they are more heavily influenced by extremists than other professions. The Central Telegraph Office remained closed for one hour today, but no incidents occurred. Military police maintained order inside the office. Recently, several employees of the Central Telegraph Office were suspended by the Director of Posts and Telecommunications for improper conduct. Therefore, the military police suppressed the suspended employees to prevent them from entering the office. Employees in essential public services, such as teachers and municipal workers, did not stop working. (Havas Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In order to curb the disturbances caused by the one-hour demonstration by strikers, the authorities dispatched police forces to station outside various post offices. Female workers have replaced male workers in some positions at post offices near the stock exchange. This morning, long-distance telephone connections were still unavailable during the strike period.

<h3>Spain Celebrates Republic Anniversary</h3>
<p>Madrid: Today marks the second anniversary of the establishment of the Republican government after the Spanish Revolution. On April 14, 1931, the Spanish people overthrew the autocratic regime, exiled Spanish King Alfonso XIII, and transformed the monarchy into a republic without any turmoil. During the municipal elections on April 12, the country unanimously expressed its opposition to the monarchy. Although the Royalist side complained about the elections, rumors spread on the night of April 12, and by April 13, Alfonso had quietly left the country. On April 14, the Republican government was proclaimed in Eibar, northern Spain, and the entire country wholeheartedly supported the Republican government. At 1:00 PM, the tide of revolution had spread to Barcelona, and by 4:00 PM, the Republican flag was flying in Madrid. That night, Alfonso fled in a panic. Today, celebrations are being held across the country, not only to celebrate the overthrow of the monarchy. In many cities, celebrations are extended for two days. Although internal turmoil has erupted in various regions since the revolution, especially last year, the Republican government has undertaken numerous initiatives, but few are worth mentioning. Here are a few examples: (1) The Republican government has overthrown the conservative old system and adopted Western civilization to Europeanize Spain. (2) The Republican government has established a higher standard of political morality, and its establishment has been recognized. Although lower-level officials have been accused of violating the law, no one has ever privately criticized a cabinet member for improper conduct. (3) Regarding the employment of the lower classes, there is a minimum wage. Under certain circumstances, such as having property and children receiving education, rewards and protection are provided to ensure that the people can follow the right path. (4) The management of domestic military affairs has been largely successful, and the army has completely separated from politics. (National News Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Medical Progress: Resurrection from Death – Results of Soviet Russian Medical Research</h3>
<p>(Moscow, TASS Dispatch, March 15) The Disease Diagnosis Institute affiliated with the Soviet Russian Health Committee is studying the causes of death in patients with pleurisy, with Smirnov leading the research. Smirnov has proven that the regular functioning of the heart can be restored even after the heart stops beating and blood flow ceases for 30 minutes. Scientists experimented on dogs, first electrocuting them to death. Within 30 seconds, the heart stopped beating, breathing ceased, and reflexes disappeared. This situation is similar to that of patients who die from pleurisy. After half an hour, the chest was cut open, and a solution of potassium and calcium was injected into the heart. As a result, heart activity, breathing, and reflexes were fully restored. Two puppies that were tested by the institute a few weeks ago are now exceptionally healthy. This proves that death from pleurisy is not true death and can be revived using the above method. The same is true for those who die from electrocution. Smirnov stated that death from high-voltage electricity is a state of suspended animation, and true death occurs after 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Central Commemoration Week: Ju Zheng Advocates Frugal Consumption</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 126th weekly commemoration of Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 16th. Attendees included committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Deng Jiayan, Li Zonghuang, Gu Zhenggang, Liu Shouzhong, Chen Ce, Xie Zuomin, Li Ciwen, and other central committee staff members, totaling approximately 500 people. The meeting was presided over by Ju Zheng, who led the ceremony and reported on promoting frugality starting from material consumption. He stated that the New Life Movement has begun, and people from all walks of life are responding enthusiastically. This is indeed the best opportunity for the revival of the Chinese nation. However, regarding the goals of the New Life Movement, there are a few key points that we must clearly recognize and resolutely implement. That is, to practice frugality starting from material consumption. The obstacles to the New Life Movement are lack of vigor in spirit, licentiousness and laziness in behavior, and extreme enjoyment and consumption in material terms. The former is the result of the obstacles, while the latter is the cause of the obstacles. To eliminate this root cause, we must start with enjoyment and consumption. Currently, the upper class in China has no other strengths except consumption, and most of the clothes, food, housing, and transportation they consume rely on foreign countries. This phenomenon is unprecedented in any other country. If we want to talk about reviving the nation and reviving the countryside, we cannot ignore such a serious problem and bad habit without changing it. The New Life Movement has now taken on this responsibility and entrusted it to the upper class. It is hoped that those who live extravagant urban lives will quickly become aware of this, so that the Chinese nation can embark on the path of revival. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Question of Recognizing the Puppet Manchuria: Translated from the "Millard's Review" by Yi Lu</h3>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the Japanese warlords are using violence to force China to recognize "Manchukuo." The situation in North China has once again fallen into a serious alarm. Furthermore, reports from various sources indicate that a certain member of the Central Committee has expressed his recent observations on the results of the three provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shaanxi, deeply believing that the situation in North China, especially Hebei Province, is not only serious, but also shocking. He said that although the two Great Wall passes of Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou have been nominally returned to China by Japan, the actual power is still in the hands of the Japanese military. Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, also said after inspecting North China that the situation in North China is not only serious but also irrecoverable. Tang is extremely pessimistic about the future of North China. Now, Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, has expressed his intention to leave Beiping and go south to Hankou, Nanchang, and Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Zhang Xueliang, and other important officials of the National Government to jointly discuss how to deal with the crisis-ridden situation in North China.</p>
<p>Based on evidence from various sources, Japan will indeed launch another threatening action to invade North China. The purpose is nothing more than to force the National Government into a city-under-siege alliance and then recognize "Manchukuo." Akita Arita, the Japanese minister remaining in Shanghai, has repeatedly expressed his intention to return to Tokyo, but he has told Nanjing officials that he must receive China's reply before leaving China.</p>
<p>Whether Japan will drive its troops straight to Tianjin and trigger another international conflagration, she is still extremely hesitant. However, Japan today is in an extremely serious predicament internationally. If it cannot force China to recognize "Manchukuo," it will be impossible to extricate itself. Regarding the next naval conference, the Japanese government must formally notify the United Kingdom and the United States and declare its intentions before the end of this year. In other words, Japan must clearly indicate whether it will demand an equal ratio of navy with the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>As for the naval ratio, both the United Kingdom and the United States have notified Japan that any significant change to the currently stipulated ratio of 5:5:3 will be unanimously opposed. Furthermore, they told Japan that if Japan insists on changing the existing ratio, the entire Far East issue must be re-discussed. Therefore, before the next disarmament conference is convened, Japan wants to clarify Sino-Japanese relations, especially to make China recognize "Manchukuo," because in this way, the disputes over the Manchuria issue at the next conference can not only be eliminated, but also bind China's hands and feet so that her representatives cannot follow the old example of raising the Shandong issue at the Washington Conference in 1921-1922.</p>
<p>And then request to raise the Manchuria issue.</p>
<p>Moreover, after China recognizes "Manchukuo," it will immediately open convenient doors for any country to recognize this puppet. At that point, everyone can sit down quietly at the disarmament conference without any other disturbances. Then, after some modification, even a smaller naval ratio, as long as it is enough to preserve the face of the Japanese military state, Japan will be happy to accept it.</p>
<p>"Manchukuo" will once again constitute a difficult international issue. It can be seen from this that the countries cannot rest assured until China recognizes it. In fact, it is said that China has received strong hints from various European countries that as long as China recognizes "Manchukuo" and resolves its disputes with Japan, then matters such as borrowing money may be of some benefit in the future. Not long after the US-Japan exchange of notes, London and Paris issued propaganda, confirming that the United States was planning to recognize "Manchukuo." It can be seen how Europeans are thinking, speculating, and caring about this difficult international issue. However, these European propagandists are wrong because the United States does not want to recognize "Manchukuo" unless China recognizes it first. But if China is to recognize "Manchukuo," it will naturally be beneficial to Japanese imperialism, but it will be a fatal blow to China itself. This will constitute strong evidence that Japan is right and China is wrong in the entire dispute over the Manchuria incident. This will place China entirely under the control of the Japanese military. This will destroy the achievements of the development of the democratic movement in the Asian continent for the past fifty years, and the gains China has made in the construction of civil rights for more than twenty years will be deprived without any residue, but instead, the country will be formed into a dependency of the Japanese Empire. This will cause officials with an independent spirit in China to hide elsewhere, and the places they originally governed will be taken over by a generation of puppet traitors who are secretly directed by others, just like the ugly drama that Manchuria is currently playing.</p>
<p>Because Japan, in the Manchuria incident, ignored its own capabilities and was fond of boasting, it is now on the verge of financial, economic, and political crises. But if she can force China to recognize Manchukuo, then the international situation will not be difficult to immediately turn around. She can borrow unlimited foreign debts from abroad and use them to consolidate her position in Asia and to promote China into her pure colony.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the situation in North China is extremely serious due to Japan's intimidation and coercion. It is even more undoubted that if the Japanese military dared to be reckless in this atmosphere of panic, the situation in North China would become even more serious. However, at this serious time, if China succumbs and voluntarily accepts the conditions for recognizing "Manchukuo," which are related to the life and death of the country, then not only will the situation in a part of North China be hopeless, but the entire China will also fall into a state of despair.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization's Korean Sabotage Plan: Destroy Various Facilities and Assassinate Important Officials</h3>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 10th, a group of red Koreans who recently infiltrated the Manchurian-Russian border from Vladivostok were investigated by the Japanese authorities in Jiandao and it was determined that their purpose was alarming. Their main purpose is to sabotage various constructions in "Manchukuo" and assassinate important Japanese and Manchurian figures. They are secretly active in contacting Russians, Chinese, and Koreans in Manchuria. This group has been active for many years under Serdin, the director of the Vladivostok Intelligence Bureau, and is led by Korean Choi Goryeo, a member of the Korean Department of the Nikolsk Party. On February 25, under the important instructions of Director Serdin, he secretly crossed the Soviet-Manchurian border with Yu Renjun, a member of the secret work department of the Red Army and Navy in Khabarovsk, and went to Huibei Beigou in Hunchun County, Jiandao. Then, they entered Ningketa on the eastern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway via Luozigou in Wangqing County and contacted the communist leaders in the area. Then they went to Harbin. When they passed through Ningguta, Choi and Yu issued the following important orders: (1) Sabotage the Jingtu Railway; (2) Bomb various constructions in "Manchukuo"; (3) Assassinate Japanese and Manchurian high officials; (4) Promote the redization of the military and police; (5) Assist the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association; (6) Buy over various labor unions and labor groups and spread redization; (7) Promote anti-Japanese and anti-Manchurian sentiment; (8) Plan to transport bombs and other weapons; (9) Investigate Japanese-Russian and communist elements; (10) Sabotage the current situation of the Japanese-Manchurian military and police and scout various facilities. Furthermore, it was found that they were wearing Chinese clothes and carrying four bombs, twenty feet of fuse, a package of explosives, and four pistols. There are also dozens of secret work teams of the same kind active in Manchuria, Korea, China, and Japan. Wang Qiyue and Ma Jing are the advance team in Manchuria. The Japanese and Manchurian authorities have issued a general order for strict alert everywhere due to the serious nature of the plan.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Arsenal of Japan Manufactures New-Style Armored Vehicles: Installs New Weapons and Wireless Equipment</h3>
<p>Liaoning Communication, the Japanese army is extremely prepared for war weapons and is intensifying its expansion. Recently, a series of the newest and most sophisticated armored vehicles (for railway use), totaling ten vehicles, has been built in the Northeast Arsenal. Among them, seven vehicles each have three or four new-style guns and heavy machine guns placed on them. Another passenger car-style armored vehicle has several red copper wires, which are special new-style wireless equipment. The car skins are all six or seven inches thick and extremely strong, and cannot be destroyed except by extremely large shells. They are also painted in green and yellow colors to hide from the enemy's sight. The power of these new-style railway armored vehicles is worthy of attention in future operations.</p>

<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>After the meeting commenced with due ceremony, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered his address.  Next, Yuan Lvdeng, a representative of the Chinese Directors and Committee Members to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, gave a report.  After the report, voting commenced for the election of five Chinese directors to the Public Works Department, six Chinese committee members, one land committee member, and twenty-seven executive committee members for this session.

Resolved and passed, with any remainder to be rounded using the rule of rounding up or down.</p>
<p>(9) Hereafter, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession should give taxpayers and stakeholders ample consideration before implementing new facilities. For matters related to taxpaying Chinese, especially those linked to the business community, the contents of the matter must be submitted to this Association for discussion, and this Association should inform the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, notifying relevant commercial groups to appoint representatives to conduct thorough deliberation. If necessary, these representatives may attend relevant meetings of the Public Works Department to express their opinions, in order to facilitate comprehensive planning, avoid disputes, and facilitate implementation. (Suggestion from the Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturing Trade Association) Resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Representative Wang Xiaolai proposed an ad hoc motion that the election regulations of this Association should be further studied and improved to achieve perfection. Resolved and referred to the Executive Committee for handling.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Representatives from the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan of the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government, esteemed delegates, we should now have an accurate and rational explanation for the status of the Shanghai Special Area (i.e., the concessions), because there are still misunderstandings among both Chinese and foreign individuals. Originally, the concession system is not allowed to exist in independent countries. However, since this system exists, its arrival was gradual, and its departure cannot be accomplished overnight. This is a fact, not something that can be determined by subjective will. Currently, a small minority of foreigners still believes that this special area is a special area for foreigners, and that the concession is a concession for foreigners. Some Chinese individuals are also unable to avoid this error unless they understand the true content. Indeed, before April 19, 1928 (Republic of China year 17), the status of the First Special Area could not escape the interpretation of the aforementioned small minority of foreigners. However, the situation changed greatly afterward, and the complexion changed absolutely. What is the reason for this? It is because Chinese directors were added to the Public Works Department from the aforementioned date. According to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, although it was not so originally, the nine seats of the Public Works Department's board of directors only had foreigners eligible for election. Naturally, the special area's municipal administration was managed by foreigners. Once Chinese directors joined, the Public Works Department changed from being supported solely by foreigners to being supported jointly by Chinese and foreigners. Due to this fact, the special area's municipal self-governance organ has become a "municipal self-governance organ jointly managed by Chinese and foreign residents." If this can evolve and be given a short period of transition, it is indeed the most peaceful and simplest way to unify and complete Shanghai's municipal administration. We, not only we, but also enlightened and rational foreigners, all have the aforementioned desire. Therefore, on February 12 of this year, this Association, in accordance with Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, telegraphed the competent authorities, requesting negotiations and authorizing the Public Works Department to increase the number of Chinese directors by four this year. The right to deliberate on the increase of Chinese directors in the Public Works Department belongs to the local authorities in Shanghai and the consuls of the related countries stationed in Shanghai, and the right to approve it belongs to our government and the representatives of the related countries. The Public Works Department itself and other residents absolutely have no room for approval or disapproval under the law. Unexpectedly, the Public Works Department did not understand this law and rashly stated in its letter in response to this Association, "Out of consideration for the public opinion of the citizens, the foreign directors believe that increasing the number of Chinese directors is not yet the time. Even if an increase were proposed, it would not gain the support of the representatives of the related countries." These few words contain the following four fallacies: (1) Dividing the entire Public Works Department into two segments, namely, a segment of foreign directors and a segment of Chinese directors, which impairs the dignity of the Public Works Department. (2) Foreign directors unilaterally deciding the rights of Chinese residents, fundamentally negating the opinions of Chinese directors. (3) Arbitrarily presuming the opinions of the representatives of the related countries. (4) Still regarding Class A taxpayers as being able to restrict or open the rights of Class B taxpayers. We deeply regret this. Now, the representative election system and asset restrictions are considered to be inferior. Universal suffrage should be used. However, the directors of the Public Works Department have tax payment amount restrictions on their eligibility for election and the right to vote, so it is difficult to avoid the suspicion of a wealth class monopolizing power, even if there is no fact of such. If universal suffrage were implemented, perhaps not only we, but even foreigners, would be eager for it. The number of representatives in the representative system should be proportional to the population, which is the trend of modern times. However, we absolutely do not want to use the advantage of occupying more than 95% of the population to confront them. Therefore, under the election system, the number of seats on the Public Works Department's board of directors, based on the amount of tax paid, is indeed a legitimate and reasonable foundation. Moreover, on March 26, 1928 (Republic of China year 17), this Association sent a letter to Fei Xindun, the Chief Director of the Public Works Department, and the first item in the letter stated, "The number of seats for Chinese directors must be based on the proportion of tax revenue..." At the same time, Chief Director Fei's reply did not deny or refute it. However, six years later, in his position as director-general, he stated regarding the proportion of tax revenue, "Your Association's so-called number of seats for Chinese directors must be directly proportional to the amount of tax revenue from Chinese citizens. If implemented, the jurisdiction of the concession will purely belong to the Chinese. Anyone familiar with the international nature of the concession and its political environment knows that at present or in the near future, foreign citizens will never voluntarily agree to this argument, leading to the emergence of this situation. Therefore, in order to maintain harmonious cooperation between Chinese and foreigners, the number of seats for Chinese directors should not be based on what your Association suggests, except for some kind of foundation." Can this not make people feel that part of the taxes paid by taxpayers are being thrown into a bottomless pit? We will never give up the content of the aforementioned exchange of letters on March 26 until Chief Director Fei's so-called "some kind of foundation" has been put forward and agreed to or tacitly approved by us. Municipal self-governing organs, in running municipal administration, naturally cannot do without funds, and the collection of municipal expenses is naturally the responsibility of the citizens. However, the increase or decrease of public finances is indeed intertwined with the rise and fall of private finances. If private finances are in a state of utter exhaustion, public finances will continue to expand. This is like draining the pond to catch the fish. Currently, those who manage self-governing organs, the numbers shown in the annual budget and final accounts are increasing year by year, without regard to the decline of the social economy and the reduction of the taxpaying ability of the residents. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession, because the tax rate cannot be increased at will, must raise the rent, which is a solid standard, as the only way to implement additional taxes. Also, because the land price has no fixed standard to rely on, it can be estimated at will to increase tax revenue, which directly increases rent, causing taxpayers the hardship of being unable to do business or reside, and indirectly makes the market even more depressed and the number of unemployed even larger. This Association, as the First Special Area was in April of 1928 (Republic of China year 17), its status has become a self-governing area jointly managed by Chinese and foreign residents, its prosperity and decline are intertwined. Therefore, we are extremely concerned about the rise and fall of the market and do not neglect the balance of the Public Works Department's budget. Under the circumstances of private finances being in an indescribable state of decline, which cannot be denied or ignored, in order to balance the Public Works Department's budget, in addition to education expenses, on the one hand, we should strive to economize, and on the other hand, we should find other ways to compensate. What should be economized even more is: (1) Abolishing the music band, which costs 300,000 yuan per year; (2) Abolishing the exchange subsidy, because there is no reduction when the exchange rate rises; (3) Changing to employees with the same ability but lower salaries; (4) Stopping all unnecessary and non-urgent projects and equipment. The general tax rate and the budget for this year have not been increased, which is indeed a sign of the Public Works Department's farsightedness. If the market does not see a turnaround, I am afraid that not only is an increase in taxes not allowed by the facts, but the proposal to reduce taxes is also beyond human control. It is the trend of modern times that municipal self-governing organs should bear the responsibility of educating citizens. Anyone with a little common sense does not dare to deny this. Those who use some kind of regulations or customs as an excuse, believing that the Public Works Department has no responsibility to run education, are running counter to the trend of the times. On March 26, 1928 (Republic of China year 17), in the exchange of letters between this Association and the Public Works Department, there was a common understanding that education expenses should account for 20% of total revenue. Because there is an eight-year education expansion plan, from 1931 to 1938 (Republic of China years 20 to 27), in addition to converting the original four public schools into complete middle schools, two girls' middle schools and seventeen complete primary schools will be added. In addition, there are subsidies for private primary and middle schools, which shows that the Public Works Department has paid great attention to the responsibility of educating citizens. Director-General Bell's active advocacy of education is also admired by taxpayers. It is a pity that Mr. Bell is retiring this session, having served the Public Works Department continuously for nine years since the May Thirtieth Movement. Taxpayers should naturally compose a poem in his praise. According to the eight-year education plan, by this year, half of the new schools should have been added. However, due to the excessive scale of the construction of school buildings, the new construction was suspended, and the education expenses were not able to account for 20% of the total revenue, which made the expansion of education not as planned, which is regrettable. It must be known that the development of municipal administration and the progress of material things should be consistent with the improvement of culture. If not, with the unsound intelligence of the citizens, the progress of material things will especially increase the cost of defense, so that the municipal administration cannot continue. In the First Special Area, there are about 150,000 children aged six to fourteen who should be in school. Even if private schools accommodate half of them, there are still 75,000 children who should be directly educated by the Public Works Department. If the aforementioned seventeen primary schools are all opened, with each school accommodating 600 people, that is only 10,200 people, which is still far from the number of children who should be educated. Since the funds for building school buildings are not available this year, taxpayers cannot be forced, but renting private houses to add schools is also easy. As for funding, the 300,000 yuan saved from the music band and the subsidy education funds not used in 1931 (Republic of China year 20) are enough to open six primary schools without significantly increasing the budget. Furthermore, if primary schools are run by the Ministry of Education and the school buildings of the four public schools and one girls' middle school are used to run evening schools, the culture of this district will improve quickly, and the citizens' ability to self-govern will be enriched, and it will be easier to proceed with the economization of defense and health expenses. Furthermore, the allocation of education funds should be determined according to the needs of the citizens. Within the same self-governing area, the intelligence of the citizens varies greatly, which creates many obstacles to cooperation, and can also cause a danger that the unbalanced development of citizens will affect the whole body. It is hoped that the directors and committee members of the Public Works Department of this session will correct the established rules of the previous schools. The unification and completion of Shanghai's municipal administration is only a matter of time, and is recognized by diplomats, lawyers, and scholars of international events. However, during the transition period, there should be adequate preparation, which is an inherent part of the topic. It should be noted that in the aforementioned exchange of letters on March 26, 1928 (Republic of China year 17), it was stated that the directors of all departments of the Public Works Department should at least be deputized by Chinese, and the same was stated for the principals of the four Chinese children's public schools. Since the assistant superintendent of the Public Works Department's police department has been promoted by Chinese, and Chinese have been hired as municipal consultants and meeting organizers, public opinion is very supportive. The previous Public Works Department also selected a Chinese as deputy director in the police department, selected a Chinese as the bureau's auditor, and added two Chinese members to the land property committee. These are all preliminary steps in implementing the aforementioned preparation. In this session, we should immediately authorize the Public Works Department to select a Chinese as deputy director-general in the General Office, and all other departments should be handled in the same way as the Police Department. The vice principals of the four Chinese children's public schools have been filled by Chinese. If we can take it a step further, when the term of the Western principals expires, Chinese will be promoted to their positions, so that Chinese can run Chinese education, which is more suitable for the principles of education. Shanghai is China's economic center, and the First Special Area is the center of Shanghai's economic center, which is an undeniable fact. However, Shanghai is a hub for international trade goods. If this point is not recognized and it is thought that the Shanghai Special Area is an impregnable fortress, even if the social economy of the interior collapses completely, this special area will become more prosperous. This is a mistaken observation. We only know that Nanjing Road is the essence of Shanghai's business circle. In the past, each house required a huge amount of rent and a large amount of key money and commissions. Now, even if no key money is charged and considerable concessions are given, very few people are interested, and even abandoning huge renovations, terminating the lease, and choosing to relocate elsewhere is becoming common. This situation occurred three years ago and is prevalent this session. If we do not concentrate our efforts, take a long-term view, seek the prosperity of the rural areas of the interior on the one hand, and adjust the social economy of this city on the other hand, especially the municipal administrative organs adopting social policies in terms of taxes, the rural areas of the interior will not recover, and the Shanghai Special Area will collapse. In theory, we should not involve such facts in this Association, so as not to cause negative thoughts among everyone, but the economic situation of the interior is closely related to this district, sharing prosperity and decline. If we understand this key point, we will definitely carry out the work of revitalizing the rural areas of the interior more practically and will not hide the truth as the best policy. At the same time, the municipal authorities, understanding this situation, may not use the method of draining the pond to catch fish, thinking that it is a way to increase the budget. All the recordable work of the previous session regarding this Association and the directors and committee members attending the Public Works Department can be found in the booklet. Please refer to it, esteemed delegates.</p>
<p>Report of Directors and Committee Members</p>
<p>We were mistakenly elected by the previous delegate assembly to serve as directors of the Public Works Department and members of various committees for one term. Today, we are pleased to meet at the first meeting of the delegate assembly in 1934 (Republic of China year 23). We would like to report to you, esteemed delegates, on the bureau affairs in which we participated over the past year, focusing on those that are of greater concern to us Chinese:</p>
<p>(1) Distribution of Committee Members of the Administrative Committee. The highest administrative power of the Public Works Department rests with the Board of Directors. Under the Board of Directors, committees are established according to the needs of municipal administration. Although the number of committees may increase or decrease slightly each session, the general structure has been inherited over the years without major changes. The committee is the organ for actually handling various important political affairs within the concession. Except for routine and minor administrative affairs, which are handled by various administrative offices, such as the Health Office and the Public Works Office, according to established regulations, those involving major issues must be submitted to the relevant committees for deliberation. The committees must carefully and thoroughly consider the pros and cons and then propose measures to be submitted to the Board of Directors for review and approval. Therefore, most of the important political affairs in the Bureau are decided at committee meetings. After review and approval by the Board of Directors, they are implemented. Therefore, when each new Board of Directors convenes, its main task is to determine the number of seats and candidates for each committee. In addition to the directors distributing work themselves and assigning committee members elected by this Association, they may also appoint reputable and knowledgeable Chinese and foreign citizens within the concession to participate in the organization. If there are special problems within the concession that are of great importance, the Board of Directors often hires Chinese and foreign experts to form temporary committees to be solely responsible for exploring the issues and preparing reports for selection and adoption. In the past, there was the Waterworks Committee, and recently there was the Rickshaw Committee. There are a total of twelve main committees in this session. Those that are temporarily added due to administrative needs are not included. In addition to the directors and committee members elected by this Association, there are about 30 Chinese committee members who are hired by the Public Works Department. The Water Rate Review Committee is even chaired by a Chinese committee member. As for the Land Committee, which previously only had foreign committee members, two Chinese members were added to this session in accordance with the previous method of increasing Chinese directors. Chen Jutingrui was elected by taxpaying Chinese, and Feng Junbingnan was elected by Chinese real estate owners. The proposal to increase Chinese land committee members originated three years ago and was only realized after several negotiations. The composition of each major committee is listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Finance Committee: 7 members, 2 Chinese, Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Yu Xiji.</p>
<p>(B) Police Committee: 8 members, 3 Chinese, Director Yu Qiaqing, Hu Mengjia, and Committee Member Jiang Yiping.</p>
<p>(C) Public Works Committee: 6 members, 2 Chinese, Director Yuan Lvdeng and Committee Member Guo Shun.</p>
<p>(D) Staff Committee: 6 members, 2 Chinese, Director Bei Songsun and Committee Member Guo Shun.</p>
<p>(E) Public Utilities Committee: 7 members, 3 Chinese, Director Hu Mengjia and Committee Members Wu Yunzhai and Yu Xiji.</p>
<p>(F) Health Committee: 8 members, 2 Chinese, Committee Members Jiang Yiping and Chen Jicheng, and Shi Meiyu.</p>
<p>(G) Transportation Committee: 6 members, 2 Chinese, Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Wu Yunzhai.</p>
<p>(H) Education Committee: 9 members, 4 Chinese, Director Yuan Lvdeng and Committee Members Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, and Ou Yuanhuai.</p>
<p>(2) The Process of Resolving the Water Meter Problem. The water meter problem began after the Shanghai Waterworks Company and the Public Works Department signed a water meter contract and changed to water meter billing, which resulted in a sharp increase in water bills and led to disputes. Subsequently, the Bureau revised the contract and established a trial method, estimating the necessary water consumption for each level of user and charging fees based on the amount of rent. This was implemented on April 1 of last year, with the trial period set for one year. However, after a few months, there were still cases of water bills being twice as high as the rent, and disputes arose again. We believe that drinking water is of great importance to people's livelihood, that the burden on poor users should not be increased, and that the health of the entire society should be taken into account. Therefore, we suggested the establishment of a Price Review Committee to be responsible for resolving difficulties and disputes. The Bureau then hired three Chinese and foreign committee members to form the committee, with Feng Junbingnan as chairman. Its task is to resolve all water bill disputes and to review the accounts and files of the Waterworks Company at any time in order to determine a fair price. Now, with the approval of the Board of Directors based on the recommendation of the Review Committee, the water price has been uniformly reduced by 20% starting from April 1 of this year, also for a period of one year, after which it will be reviewed again. This is only a temporary solution to help users. As for the revision of the price list, with the aim of being fair and balanced and lasting for a long time, it still needs to be carefully planned by the committee.</p>
<p>(3) Improvement of the Rickshaw System. Among the various municipal improvements this year, the most important is the improvement of the rickshaw system. Initially, the Public Works Department hired five Chinese and foreign committee members to form the Rickshaw Committee to study improvement measures. After several months, sixteen articles were drafted and submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. Upon hearing the news, rickshaw owners protested en masse. After careful deliberation by the Board of Directors, it was decided to adopt thirteen articles first. The other three articles, concerning the recovery of rickshaw licenses and the organization of new companies, were postponed. A paid committee was formed, with two Chinese members and one Western member, responsible for implementing the aforementioned articles. Once the candidates are determined, it can be established.</p>
<p>(4) Cancellation of the Telephone Price Increase. In October of last year, the Shanghai Telephone Company submitted a request to the Public Works Department for approval to increase prices, with the increase aiming to reach 1,060,000 taels by March 1935 (Republic of China year 24). Part of this was to make up for the company's previous losses, and part was to pay dividends to shareholders. However, when the company took over the telephone service in the concession, it had made a commitment to complete the conversion to automatic telephones within three years and not to increase prices after the increase in the Anson report. Moreover, according to the investigation by the Director of Finance, half of the company's capital is in US dollars, and the depreciation of the exchange rate has a great impact on the company's finances, which must be paid attention to. Therefore, the Board of Directors rejected the price increase proposal. Taking into account the interests of users and the company's finances, the Bureau lent the company 4 million taels to convert its dollar capital into silver capital, with the condition that the price increase in 1935 (Republic of China year 24) should not exceed 25% and that there should be no further increases within two years. When the price increase proposal was first raised, Chinese and Western citizens protested en masse. When the news of the rejection was heard, public sentiment was very pleased.</p>
<p>(5) Chinese Education Facilities. The most important Chinese education facilities this year are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Filing of Chinese Public Schools. The Public Works Department has four Chinese public schools, the earliest of which has a history of more than 30 years. Their management and curriculum have all become their own systems. After the Chinese were appointed as vice principals last year, the Education Committee began to improve the old system, adding to and subtracting from the original curriculum to make it suitable for our country's current school system. This is the most significant progress in Chinese education this year. A letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for filing and approval. In the future, graduates of each public school can receive the same treatment as graduates of public or private middle schools in our country, and those who pass the graduate examination can be promoted to national and private universities for further study, which will greatly benefit young students.</p>
<p>(B) Increase in Subsidies for Chinese Schools. Since the Public Works Department adopted the education subsidy system, the number of Chinese private schools within the concession requesting subsidies has increased year by year. Last year, there were 87 schools, with a total of 140,000 yuan. This year, it has increased to 151 schools. At our suggestion, the amount of money was increased by 50,000 yuan. Following the old practice, Chinese people were hired to form a committee to be responsible for the distribution of funds, determining their use according to the needs of each school. For schools within the concession that are directly under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Education Bureau, the Public Works Department will exempt them from house taxes to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(C) Suspension of New School Construction Plans. The Public Works Department's eight-year Chinese education plan has been implemented since its inception, and five small schools and one girls' middle school have been established. Except for one on Huade Road, each primary school has its own school building. The school building for the girls' middle school is under construction and can be moved into this year. According to the previous agreement, the original plan must be reviewed in 1934 (Republic of China year 23). As a result of the review, the construction of new schools this year has been temporarily suspended due to the Bureau's financial difficulties. This is certainly not what we Chinese want to hear. Chairman Bell is also deeply saddened that he cannot implement his original intention. Once the Bureau's finances are slightly better, we should still promote its implementation.</p>
<p>(6) Maintenance of the Old Tax Law. Although there have been proposals from time to time to increase the total tax of the Public Works Department, considering the local economic situation, which has been declining year by year, and considering the people's livelihood, which should be given more consideration, for the past two years, we have been economizing on expenditures and drawing on public reserves as a way to adjust revenue and expenditure to balance the budget. This year, the estimated revenue is 24,430,000 yuan, and the expenditure is 26,380,000 yuan, with a shortfall of 1,950,000 yuan. The Board of Directors resolved to follow the previous two-year approach and withdraw 2 million yuan from the public reserve fund to make up for it. (The public reserve fund is accumulated from the sale price of the Electricity Department and other items.) The act of increasing taxes can be discussed slowly, which should be a comfort to both Chinese and Western citizens.</p>
<p>(7) Negotiations on Extra-Boundary Road Construction and Factory Inspection. Extra-boundary road construction and factory inspection have been two outstanding cases in Chinese-foreign negotiations for years. The negotiations have been intermittent and have not been resolved. Extra-boundary road construction involves a wide area, and seeking a method of returning the land as soon as possible is the common wish of Chinese and foreigners. When the factory inspection issue first arose, we and this Association held dissenting views. After the Taxpaying Westerners Association passed the amendment to the Land Regulations Appendix, the Municipal Government also declared its opposition. Subsequently, senior officials from both sides consulted back and forth on a cooperation plan, but their opinions have not yet been unified. Therefore, the Board of Directors has not made any resolution. The resolution of this case is still pending.</p>
<p>(8) Appointment of Senior Chinese Officials. The selection of Chinese to fill the positions of senior officials in the Public Works Department is a reasonable wish of the Chinese. In 1933 (Republic of China year 22), the Bureau hired Mr. Wu Jingxiong and Mr. He Dehui to serve as municipal consultants and meeting organizers. This year, at the suggestion of this Association, a Chinese accountant was hired to audit all the accounts of the Finance Department. The Bureau has hired accountant Pan Xulun to take the position and has instructed all administrative offices to pay attention to the recruitment of Chinese whenever there are various tasks that can be filled by Chinese. Mr. Yao Zengmo of the Police Department has now been promoted to deputy director to assist in the management of affairs. Those who have made meritorious contributions, regardless of nationality, should be promoted, which is in line with the principles of fairness and meets the expectations of the Chinese. The above-mentioned matters are the recordable events of the Concession's administration over the past year, and they are of particular concern to the Chinese. Therefore, we have listed the details to report to you. Since our appointment, we have always been aware of our limitations and have been fortunate to receive encouragement from time to time, so we have been able to work hard and avoid mistakes. However, we are still ashamed that we have not lived up to your expectations. We hope you will understand.</p>

<p>Hubei Wins Third Preliminary Round of Far Eastern Basketball, Securing Finals Spot</p>
<p>Hubei wins by 43 to 39 in overtime</p>
<p>Nanjing suffers a crushing defeat after a big win due to lack of experience</p>
<p>North China plays the finals this afternoon</p>
<p>Hubei defeated Nanjing last night in the third preliminary round of the Far Eastern Games with a score of 43 to 39 after overtime, securing the right to compete in the finals against North China. Hubei initially faced a very unfavorable situation, trailing by as many as ten points with a score of 16 to 26 at halftime. However, after changing tactics and positioning Wu Guolin as center, Wu unleashed his accurate long-range shots, allowing Hubei to turn defeat into victory. At the end of regulation time, the score was tied at 39 points each. In the final five minutes of overtime, Hubei's Wu and Chen each made a basket, ultimately sealing the victory. Experience determined the outcome of the match.</p>
<p>The outcome of last night's match was entirely determined by the depth of experience. Hubei was able to persevere and remain calm despite repeated setbacks and cumulative point losses, which allowed them to reverse the defeat in the second half. For the Nanjing team, a crushing defeat followed a big win, which can be attributed to a lack of experience. In the second half, their offensive tactics faltered, while Hubei's momentum grew stronger and more aggressive. The Nanjing team became flustered as a result, leading to disarray throughout their ranks, allowing Hubei to seize the opportunity to advance. This devastating defeat is deeply regrettable. As for their individual skills, they were certainly respectable and not those of mediocre players; however, they were ultimately limited by their confinement to the capital region and a lack of frequent games.</p>
<p>Wu Guolin, a great general from Hubei</p>
<p>Wu Guolin deserves great credit for Hubei's victory. He served as a mainstay, turning the tide from impending failure. By reassigning him to the center position, the center was strengthened. Liu Mengjiu, Nanjing's sole scorer, was thereafter at a loss. Liu scored as many as 22 points in the first half, but failed to score a single point in the second half. Wu's numerous long-range shots were truly astonishing and impressive. Yu Jingxiao did not appear as outstanding last night as he had the previous night. He was lax in guarding the center circle during the initial jump ball, allowing Liu Mengjiu to penetrate as if the area was unoccupied. After retreating to the rear, he was more effective in fulfilling his responsibilities. Chen Shengkui's shooting was inferior to the previous night, but his passing was undiminished. He will certainly be selected in the future. Ge Ke was generally considered weak, and his speed also needs to be increased. As for the Nanjing team, Wu Wenzhong's performance as a defender was surprisingly satisfactory. Liu Mengjiu made repeated brilliant shots.</p>
<p>Victory and defeat are greatly influenced by the momentum of the ball and the overall game. In the opening moments, neither side could find its rhythm, failing to score. Hubei's Wang Jianmin scored a free throw, opening the scoring. Nanjing center Liu Mengjiu then made a basket. Ge Ke responded, giving Hubei a 3-2 lead. Nanjing then launched a fierce attack, with Liu Mengjiu making three consecutive long-range shots in front of the basket, making the score 8-3. Although Hubei tried its best to resist, it remained mysterious. Liu Mengjiu's long-range shots in front of the basket continued to find their mark, making the score 22-8. Nanjing exceeded Hubei by a large margin of fourteen points. Hubei maintained its composure, and Wu Guolin switched positions with Yu Jingxiao and exerted great effort, gradually closing the gap. The score at halftime was 26-16, with Nanjing leading by only ten points.</p>
<p>Hubei took the lead later.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Wu Guolin and Wu Zhongxin each scored a free throw. Although Hubei frantically counterattacked, scoring was difficult and the situation appeared very balanced. After Nanjing took a 31-20 lead, Hubei's momentum suddenly surged. Wu Guolin and Ge Ke each made four baskets, closing the gap to 31-28. With Wu's two baskets, Hubei reversed the lead to 34-33, overtaking Nanjing. From then on, the situation became tense. Although Zhang Changqing scored a free throw, tying the game, the Nanjing team showed signs of panic and disarray, knowing that the future was dangerous and that hope was diminishing. Wu Wenzhong made a basket, allowing Nanjing to regain the lead at 36-35, but Ge Ke's basket put Hubei back in the lead at 37-36. Nanjing suffered a crushing defeat in overtime.</p>
<p>Amidst extreme tension, Ge Ke made another basket, making the score 39-36. With only two minutes left in the game, Hubei's victory seemed assured. However, Zhang Changqing had a free throw opportunity, making one of his attempts. In the final seconds, Zhang Changjiang made a long-range shot, resulting in a tie at 39 points each. In the five-minute overtime, the Nanjing team failed to score any points. Hubei secured a 43-29 victory thanks to the two baskets made by Wu Guolin and Chen Shengkui. The final scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Hubei Shots Free Throws Fouls Points　　Nanjing Shots Free Throws Fouls Points</p>
<p>Chen Shengkui 5 2 2 12 Zhang Changjiang 3 0 3 6</p>
<p>Ge Ke 7 2 3 16 Zhang Changqing 4 2 2 10</p>
<p>Yu Jingxiao 0 1 0 1 Liu Mengjiu 10 0 3 22</p>
<p>Wang Jianmin 0 1 3 1 Wu Wenzhong 1 1 1 3</p>
<p>Wu Guolin 6 1 1 13 Xu 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Total 18 7 9 43 Total 18 3 9 39</p>
<p>First half: Hubei 16 points, Nanjing 26 points. Second half: Hubei 23 points, Nanjing 13 points. Overtime: Hubei 4 points, Nanjing 0 points.</p>
<p>North China vs. Hubei Finals This Afternoon</p>
<p>At the request of both teams, the final match between North China and Hubei has been rescheduled to 5:15 PM this afternoon and will still be held at the baseball field. The decision was made because the gasoline lamps at the field did not provide sufficient light for high shots, which was a significant impediment. The lamp lines have been completely removed. North China is heavily favored to win the finals against Hubei. The referee will be Zhang Guoxun.</p>
<p>Women's Tennis Preliminary Round</p>
<p>Liu Yulan defeated Huang Shuqing yesterday. Huang Shuyi will face Liu Yulan today.</p>
<p>The first day of the women's tennis preliminary round took place yesterday. Nanjing's Liu Yulan defeated Beijing's Huang Shuqing with scores of 6-1 and 6-2. Liu has excellent, steady ball control, while Huang is too aggressive, resulting in many shots going out of bounds. Liu's forehand and backhand shots are superior to Huang's, but Huang's serve is better than Liu's. After the start of the match, Huang Shuqing served first, frequently losing points. Liu, on the other hand, was versatile and successful. Huang was at a loss in the first five games, winning only four points. She tried her best to rally, winning two consecutive games to reach a score of 5-3, but ultimately lost with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>In the second set, Huang still had the advantage of serving first and fought hard to win the first game. In the next game, she took the lead with a score of 3-1 (i.e., 40-15), thinking victory was within reach. However, Liu's sweeping shots from left and right exhausted Huang, who lost four consecutive points, making the score 4-1. After losing a point, Liu completed the set with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>Huang Shuyi will play against Liu Yulan at 3:00 PM today. It is said that Shuyi's skills are superior to Shuqing's, so today's match should be even more exciting. However, Liu Yulan combines both softness and strength and has a calm demeanor, so she can still secure victory.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji still reportedly represents Java</p>
<p>There was a previous report that Huaqiao youth tennis player Xu Chengji would represent Java in this Far Eastern Games. Later, the Chinese Consul General in Batavia cabled the All-China Sports Association, deciding that Xu would represent his motherland. However, according to tennis selection committee member Li Baojun, Xu recently stated in a letter to Qiu Feihai that he still intends to represent Java. Li immediately reported this news to Shen Siliang, the chief of the Sports Association. Therefore, it is still unclear who Xu will represent. If Xu can return to China to participate in this Far Eastern Games tennis championship, China will have high hopes, because the Philippines is not a concern, and the top one or two Japanese players are all in Europe attending the Davis Cup, leaving only third- and fourth-rate players to represent them.</p>

The following players are requested to wear white Chinese team jerseys and arrive at the field on time:</p>

<p>Shanghai Swimming Preliminary</p>
<p>Tomorrow at the West Qing Swimming Pool</p>
<p>South China Football Team</p>
<p>Eighteen players, including Bao Jia Ping, selected to compete against Shanghai Team for Far East Preliminaries</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 16th) As a result of the Guangdong-Hong Kong agreement, the South China football team has selected eighteen players, including Bao Jiaping, Huang Jiliang, Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Liu Mao, Xu Yahui, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Ye Beihua, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Cao Guicheng, Chen Zhenhe, Zheng Jiliang, Li Guowei, He Zuoxian, Yang Shuiyi, and Li Guozhao, to play the Far East preliminary round against the Shanghai team.</p>
<p>Yamamoto and Matsuzawa Return to Japan, Decide to Participate in the Far Eastern Games</p>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 16th) Yamamoto and Matsuzawa, the two representatives who attended the Shanghai Round Table Conference, arrived in Tokyo at 8:30 PM on the 15th and immediately reported the proceedings to the Sports Association. Yamamoto told reporters that the atmosphere at the Shanghai Round Table Conference was generally calm for individuals, but because each representative was discussing from their own country's position, the discussions were not smooth. There were rumors that the Sports Association and I had disagreements, but all opinions were exchanged by telegram, so errors were inevitable. Japan's decision to participate in the Games will have a good impact on the conference.</p>
<p>Japanese Swimming Athletes</p>
<p>Total of Twenty-Two</p>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Osaka, 16th) The preliminary selection of swimmers for the Far Eastern Games was held on the 14th and 15th at the Koshien swimming pool in Osaka. Because 16 official athletes were decided last year, this preliminary selection only selected 6 additional athletes. The resulting athletes are as follows: Toyota (Nihon University), 100m freestyle, 200m freestyle; Ishihara Da (Waseda University), 400m; Shinma (Waseda University), Yamada (Waseda University), Kataoka (Waseda University), Aki (Komatsu Commercial). The athletes decided last year are as follows: Shikizai, Takahashi, Makino, Yokoyama, Irie, Sakagami (all of Waseda University), Yuza, Sugimoto, Hamuro (all of Nihon University), Koike (Keio), Kiyokawa (Commercial University), Kawazu (Meiji University), Kitamura (Takawa Commercial), Honda (Rikkyo), Umeda Teacher Training), Osaki (Okanishi Gakuin). The instructor is Matsumoto, the supervisor is Negishi, and the competition committee member is Nakamura.</p>
<p>Japanese Basketball Team Selected</p>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 16th) Japan has been diligently studying basketball tactics. Last year, they specially hired American basketball expert Mr. Gartner to instruct in tactics. Four years have passed since the 9th Far Eastern Games, and Japanese basketball has certainly made great progress. According to experts, it is not difficult for Japan to seize hegemony at this year's Games. However, after considering various conditions, optimism is not warranted. Manila is a tropical place, and the hot weather will inevitably have a considerable impact on Japanese athletes. Moreover, Filipino athletes are physically strong and can withstand the heat. It is difficult to predict whether the Japanese team will be able to beat the Filipino team. Also, the Chinese team, due to their crushing defeat last time, will certainly have been practicing considerably with the intention of avenging their old grudges, and their strength cannot be underestimated. If Japan is overly optimistic, unexpected setbacks may occur. Under this view, the Japan Basketball Association is proceeding cautiously with preparations in order to achieve the final goal. The members of this year's basketball team representing Japan are as follows: Forwards: Inoue (Tokyo University), Maeda (Rikkyo), Morisawa (Waseda), Saito (Waseda); Centers: Ouchi (Waseda), Tanaka (Tokyo University), Nakae (Seijo); Guards: Senno (Tokyo University), Kaneko (Tokyo University), Makiyama (Waseda), Kato (Kyoto University), Matsui (Seijo). The team will undergo intense training under the direction of instructor Kurosawa Takeo and supervisor Dohi Kazuo.</p>

Recently, people will be dispatched secretly to engage in activities in the academic circles of Pingjin to entice them to leave the pass. Solid evidence has recently been discovered, and all schools are taking strict precautions.</p>

<p>The Central and South China Culture Association was initiated and organized by Central Committee members Zhou Qigang and Ding Chaowu, as well as comrades at home and abroad who are concerned about the Nanyang issue and enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs.

Zhou Qigang was elected chairman, and Li Chonghou was the recorder. After performing the rituals, Chairman Zhou Qigang delivered an opening address, stating that the majority of overseas Chinese reside in Nanyang, and due to many obstacles with the motherland over the years, the local government has been extremely harsh. The status of overseas Chinese is no longer what it once was, and they are feeling apprehensive. The Central and South China Culture Association has emerged in response to this, with the aim of facilitating communication between Central and South China culture and drawing the attention of the Chinese people to the living conditions of overseas Chinese, so that everyone will be able to work hard for the country. Next, Liu Shimu reported on the preparatory process, stating that the motivation for organizing the Central and South China Culture Association was to unite comrades who are enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs to promote Central and South China culture, alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese, and develop the Nanyang business, from suggesting the initiation to preparing for the establishment. There have been many difficulties, and the association has finally been established. There are still many obstacles ahead, and he hopes that all members will do their best to maintain it. Finally, the constitution was approved, and directors were elected.

Regarding the location of the general association, it was decided to establish it within the Nanyang Middle School on Longhua Road, Shanghai. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Cai Jiemin's Letter to Dai Jitao</p>
<p>Regarding the excavation of ancient tombs</p>
<p>Cai Jiemin wrote to Dai Jitao, "Mr. Jitao, Upon reading your telegram, I am fully aware of your concerns. I write this letter to express my thoughts more fully. Your concern for the cultivation of virtue and the rise and fall of the nation is deeply admirable. However, my understanding of the excavation of ancient tombs by academic organizations differs from what you have heard. In recent years, the destruction of ancient tombs and historical sites has been mainly initiated by Chinese and foreign antique dealers. Local authorities have not provided adequate protection, and some may even collude with them, openly collecting taxes. (This trend in Luoyang only began to subside three to four years ago.) The manipulation of local thugs is also pervasive. This negative trend existed long before the academic excavations and has not been exacerbated by them. Furthermore, the scholars involved in archaeology have been appealing everywhere for an end to this practice. Their efforts have had some effect. In recent years, the Geological Survey Institute and the Institute of History and Philology of our academy have been conducting excavations. The excavations of the Geological Survey Institute focus on the remains of primitive humans and ancient history, which are largely unrelated to tombs. However, their most valuable discovery in recent years has been the bones of ancient humans. The work of the Institute of History and Philology focuses on ancient sites, such as the Yin Ruins and the old city of Pingling, which are the sites of ancient settlements, not the tombs of Beiman Jiujing. When burials are involved, there are only two situations: (1) Later generations may be buried in ancient sites, and they must be cleared during excavation. (2) In the case of tombs that have been looted or naturally exposed, there is concern that their historical value will be lost forever, and it is necessary to clear them. All of this work is carried out by experts, just as medical schools and hospitals sometimes need to dissect human bodies. The latter is to preserve their historical value, while the former is like building roads and mining, where it is unavoidable to encounter burials. If road construction is for the public good, then private well drilling and house construction also occasionally encounter burials. Building residential areas in the capital also requires moving graves. Given the long history of China, it is unavoidable to encounter remains and relics whenever the ground is disturbed. Your statement that this destroys national history is the opposite of what I have heard. I fear that you have been misled by informants. Scientific excavations have been rare in recent years, but their results have been recognized abroad. The meticulousness and rigor of the work are admirable. You have always advocated 'catching up with the world,' and today, there are few examples of this. This is one of them. I have heard from colleagues and others that opposition to this work comes mainly from antique dealers and their local accomplices who engage in looting, as well as some private collectors. This misinformation may have reached you. After returning to Beijing, if you investigate the facts, you will be relieved. I believe that the government should adopt more effective measures to protect historical sites and prohibit private digging. In addition, academic research should be conducted with caution and should not be generally prohibited. Restoring thousands of years of ancient history is of great value. I hope you will agree with my humble opinion. I respectfully reply and wish you good health. Your humble servant, Cai Yuanpei. April 14th."</p>
<p>Zhou Hou Shu Talks About His Impressions of Studying Education in Japan (3)</p>
<p>(6) Emphasize scientific education. Scientific knowledge is the fundamental basis for national defense, production, and all aspects of life, and it should be emphasized in school education. However, the scientific education in schools at all levels in our country, due to the simple equipment and improper teaching methods, often not only fails to promote science, but also gives students a wrong idea of science. Japanese schools, from elementary schools to universities, consistently emphasize physics, chemistry, and biology. Students use their hands and eyes to observe, experiment, and collect, and seek solutions to problems themselves. Therefore, the equipment in the laboratories is very adequate, and the teaching materials used by teachers are very simple, focusing not only on imparting knowledge, but also on inspiring new knowledge in students. The laboratory is also used as a classroom, teaching, learning, and doing at the same time, which is what is called scientific education that combines teaching, learning, and doing. Outside of schools, museums, science museums, exhibitions, excursions, and other activities are widely set up, with scientific activities, performances, exhibitions, and experiments, etc., to supplement the shortcomings of school education. There are many areas where our country's scientific education can learn and improve.</p>
<p>(7) Emphasize local teaching materials. Japanese schools often have local exhibition rooms, which are equipped with historical wall charts, events, physical objects, classics, celebrity relics, etc. of the region where the school is located, as well as geographical models, landscape models, production materials, industrial products, manufacturing methods, supply and demand comparison tables, import and export situations, population increase comparison tables, climate change charts, people's outward development, foreign war charts, etc., and scientific books, charts, and utensils related to local inventions and production, all of which are collected and arranged by students themselves, and they engage in research inside and outside of class, so that students can study the local area and then study the whole country, and love the local area and then love the country. The intention is very profound, and this should be emulated.</p>
<p>(8) Pay attention to etiquette and manners. Although etiquette, manners, sweeping, responding, advancing, and retreating were valued in ancient China, students today are often ignorant of etiquette. In general, disputes and disturbances often occur among people in society due to improper behavior and handling of things, and even lead to social unrest and national disasters. The way people get along with each other is very important and should not be ignored in education. Japanese schools often have etiquette and manners rooms, where students practice the way of dealing with people and things, and all kinds of public and private social etiquette. During my many days in Japan, I have never seen anyone arguing in the streets, but only people who are very enthusiastic about each other. Those who have studied in Japan for many years also say the same. This is actually closely related to the national spirit of unity and social customs. I believe that emphasizing etiquette training in schools is not without merit. In addition to civics courses, there is also a self-cultivation course in schools at all levels. The self-cultivation course is often taught by important teachers or the principal. Our country's education has been competing for innovation and has abolished self-cultivation for many years. I feel that it is quite necessary to restore it. The self-cultivation course should teach modern ways of dealing with people and things, and let students practice it in reality. I wonder what our country's new educators think.</p>

<p>The Shanghai News Supplement: On Civilized People and Civilized Nations</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times continues to turn forward inexorably; it cannot be forced, nor can it be restricted. Everything old and outdated must gradually, or even suddenly, be inherited and replaced by the new era. These changes, of course, are determined by the natural environment and objective historical conditions; and at the same time, they are aided by the unique "wisdom" of mankind. The development of science has surpassed nature, and the development of material civilization has become increasingly rapid and prosperous. If we compare everything around us today, including humans, with everything recorded in "The History of Human Evolution" and various other histories, it is truly incomparable. However, because this development is governed by the natural environment and the objective social relations in the historical process, it has become distorted in this world.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, and "Great Japan" in Asia should also be included, because of the development of science, everything is civilized in terms of materials, and their people have been enlightened (?) to the extreme. Therefore, their countries can be honored as "civilized countries," and their people can be honored as "civilized people." Yes, these many "civilized people" are indeed worthy of respect and admiration; look at them, they have complex brains, keen senses, superior knowledge, and smooth skills... It is they who are pushing this "civilization" forward (?), it is they who understand what it means to be a "civilized person" and know how to be a civilized person, what is reason, courtesy, public virtue... are they the most authoritative and "noble people" in the world?!</p>
<p>However, in other continents and countries on this earth, because they have not received the "baptism of science," or have not received enough or are powerless to do so, there is a "world of difference" compared to the "civilized countries." Some are isolated from the outside world (civilized places) due to geographical reasons, and therefore still live a "primitive" life. Their minds are simple, their hearts are upright, they do not understand what is courtesy, reason... they only know how to do what they think and can do, without concealment or hypocrisy... but they are only despised and even disdained by "civilized people," they are called "barbarians"; they are mostly conquered by "civilized people" with "civilized weapons" and "superior methods" and become their "slaves," "cattle and horses" | the expansion of "colonies" | they are completely subdued under the authority of "civilized people," and are cruelly abused without any regard, daring not and unable to breathe, to utter a sound... These kinds of facts have long been staged in the past historical process in many lively and tragic "famous dramas." We can sometimes recognize the true character of these "civilized people" in the images on the movie screen (such as the recent films "The Congo of Africa" and "Eskimo").. They have shameless and base behavior, cruel and violent wildness... but they can use the beautiful names of "civilization," "justice," and courtesy, which are beneficial to them, to conceal their "true face of Mount Lu"; cunning, deceit, cruelty, selfishness...</p>
<p>A famous writer in a certain country has this analogy for "civilization"... A civilization that is beautiful on the outside but ugly inside is like a battlefield; no matter where you dig a hoe into the ground, you will discover terrifying, unsightly, and unbearable odors that will make you sick. Well, now let's take a look at our own "vast and resource-rich" country!</p>
<p>How long has it been since our China received the "scientific baptism" of various "civilized countries"? Therefore, everything has been "civilized" with the help of these many "kind and friendly civilized people" | especially in the major cities, isn't it? Who can say that it is not comparable to the "civilized countries" in appearance? Then why can't our compatriots emulate the various aspects of "civilized people" and be on par with them? But let's turn around and examine ourselves! Can our country also be honored as a "civilized country"? Don't dream, my friend! Don't you see? What are the "civilized people" of various "civilized countries" doing, surrounding you with greedy eyes? This fat and delicious "meat on the chopping board" has already begun to be "partitioned," have you noticed it? Have you spoken out? Do you remember? When a large piece of "fat" was cut off from "Northeast" by the "civilized" Japanese, in the "civilized countries," the newspapers of those "civilized people" greatly praised the "comrades" | Japan | saying that Japan was opposing China's "barbarism," and that they were the "defenders of civilization"... My friend, today, can "a barbarian" who is in the position of "semi-colony" want to be on par with "a civilized person"? Tsk, tsk!</p>
<p>Smart friends! "So this is what civilized people are like," we have come to realize it once again. Originally, every partial and small problem must also be connected to the whole and entire problem. In the "next installment" | the whole | before "decomposition," what kind of preparations will we make?</p>
<p>A Writer in a Garret: One Apple</p>
<p>A writer in a garret buried himself in hard work and wrote a masterpiece, "The Theory of Love's Ruin." After it was published in a certain publication, he joined some organization and began to talk grandly about "China in the Last Fifty Years." This wild man's head was actually sold, winning the support of most people, and the great name of the writer in the garret was praised like the wind. A certain minister hired him as a private secretary with a generous salary.</p>
<p>One day when the spring breeze blew into the world, the writer in the garret reluctantly left his old residence where he had lived for five years and moved into a Western-style house that cost seventy taels a month. Our writer naturally no longer wore the tattered Western suit he wore when he was down and out. Walking, he would hold his head high and enter the reception room. He imitated the attitude of famous people, bowing deeply to thank the good friends and distinguished guests who came to congratulate him on his moving. In the evening, he held a grand banquet, and everyone smiled and drank heartily; even those who had previously scolded the writer in the garret as someone's lackey now flattered him as a great writer and literary master. Our writer also forgot the story of walking to a friend's house in the heavy snow to beg for a meal. He raised his glass and shouted "Please, please" to the guests. It goes without saying that the host and guests were happy and dispersed.</p>
<p>The position of private secretary to a certain minister is the most profitable and effortless job. If the minister does not go to XX, the writer in the garret does not have to go to the yamen. If the minister has something to do, he will make a phone call to invite him, and it will not be more than two or three times a month. Therefore, in addition to his public and private social activities, while working hard on compiling and translating "China in the Last Fifty Years," his manuscripts can be found everywhere. Although the editor once stuffed his manuscripts into the wastebasket untouched, now, as long as his name is signed, the remuneration is particularly generous.</p>
<p>The writer in the garret's income increased day by day, and he thought of a major event that had previously made him so annoyed that he smoked desperately.</p>
<p>On a spring night when he couldn't sleep, a chartered car sent our writer, who was twenty pounds heavier than before, into the dance hall. There was intoxicating music and fascinating bodies. He hugged the dancing girl and danced wildly as if he were drunk. Those enchanting eyes and slightly raised breasts made him feel lost in the white-hot air, and he felt as if he were in a Turkish bath, not knowing whether he was alive or dead. Then, the writer in the garret was inspired to write poetry...</p>
<p>Spring breeze, why did you stir my heart,</p>
<p>Spring breeze, my heart is moved...</p>
<p>When the East turned white after sensual dancing and revelry, the smiling dancing girl was still tired, and our writer was taken back to the small Western-style house by car in his arms.</p>
<p>The air in the Western-style house was rich and fragrant, and laughter rippled. The original manuscript of "China in the Last Fifty Years" danced like butterflies between the dancing girl's jade fingers coated with nail polish. The writer in the garret hugged her half-naked body and smiled greedily. He did not care that the crystallization of his hard work had turned into flowing water.</p>
<p>From then on, he no longer cried poverty or boredom. Although the pre-publication advertisement for "The Theory of Love's Ruin" was published, "China in the Last Fifty Years" would never be completed.</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox: Expel the Bad Father</p>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>Since the establishment of this column, I have seen that readers with difficult questions have been given satisfactory solutions; especially the analysis of "A Family's Life" answered the other day was detailed and insightful, which is admirable! Now, this humble man also has a question about "A Family's Life" and asks for guidance on a way out, not only for the sake of this humble man, but also for the welfare of "a family's life." I sincerely burn incense and pray for it.</p>
<p>My family has lived in Wumen for generations. My grandfather started his business with silk and satin. Before the Yuan Restoration, it was a golden age, and the products were sold at home and abroad. The life was relatively prosperous, so he became addicted to opium... My father was born in a prosperous time and did not engage in production. He only wandered around and became addicted to opium. After the eighth year of the Republic of China, the domestic market was gradually invaded by serge, and it could not be sold abroad. Even the only sales channel for Korean silk was expelled by Japan's heavy tax of 100% of the value; therefore, the business declined day by day, and on the other hand, my father became more and more aggravated, sinking into smoking and gambling. If his requests were not met, he would secretly take goods and pawn them for use. My grandfather had no choice but to gradually narrow the scope of business until it finally ceased. Later, he placed my father in a vocational training center, hoping to reform him; after six years, my father found a way to get out on his own. My grandfather thought that he had experienced something and might be able to start anew, so he did not stop him. At first, he was quite energetic, only having early tea and simple meals... But in less than a year, he relapsed into his old habits. Three years ago, my grandfather, the source of "a family's life," fell ill and never recovered. Years of weddings and funerals have gradually exhausted the accumulated wealth, but my father still does not care about the family's difficulties, and only smokes and asks my grandmother and mother for money. My mother recently saw that the children were growing up, and she was afraid that they would be dissatisfied and repeat her past behavior (pawning clothes and belongings). Seeing today's situation again, she has been patient with him, resulting in the family's economic situation being at the end of its rope. A family of seven (excluding the three brothers) relies solely on rental income to maintain their food, clothing, and other expenses, but it is still not enough. My mother intends to have me and my brothers contribute money, but my brothers' income is limited (only about ten or twenty yuan each), and we cannot even support ourselves, so how can we have the extra strength to bear the burden? However, although our family's economic situation feels tight, we can still rely on rental income to maintain vegetable rice and cloth clothing. (The reason why I said it is not enough before is because a part of the rent is taken by my father.) However, if my father continues to do this and does not quit smoking, the savings that my grandmother has accumulated for a hundred years will also be gradually used up, and the burden will be entirely on us. I ask, how can we bear this! On the one hand, the family is in dire straits for daily use, and cannot make ends meet; at the same time, we are burdened with this burden, and we are exhausted and sometimes cannot keep up, and there is even a danger of running out of food. Therefore, I wrote to my mother to persuade my father to quit smoking. After quitting, after deducting personal tea and snacks, the remaining money would be transferred to the family for use, so that we would not be unable to afford food and clothing. But he is stubborn and says, "I don't care about family affairs, I will smoke until I die." Alas! Even the stubborn stone nodded when Sheng Gong preached the Dharma, but my own father is like this! How can a son not be sad! I wish I could throw myself into a clear stream to end my troubles,</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>and not hear or ask about anything. I am ashamed to be the eldest son and cannot sit idly by. For the sake of "a family's life," and for the sake of a new beginning, since loyal words are not accepted, then I can only sacrifice everything, not ask about the world's criticism, and rather be an unfilial son who commits a great crime in "patriarchal society," and righteously restrain my father's recklessness and bring him to justice, so that "a family's life" can have a glimmer of hope, and preserve the family property, so that it will not be destroyed. However, in the world, there are only laws for "expelling bad children" and "sending bad children to vocational training centers for reform," but we are suffering from our father's burden, so deeply and painfully. I do not know if the law has any relief provisions? Are there any other appropriate methods to deal with it? I hope that you, sir, will not be annoyed by my tediousness and indicate a way out to save this "family's life," then I will be grateful for your great virtue. I am writing with tears in my eyes, not knowing what I am saying. I hereby ask for your peace.</p>
<p>A Troubled Person: Wan Zhidacode:</p>
<p>Answer: The editor is deeply saddened by Mr. Wan's situation; and Mr. Wan's words, "I can only sacrifice everything, not ask about the world's criticism, and rather be an unfilial son who commits a great crime in 'patriarchal society,' and righteously restrain my father's recklessness... so that 'a family's life' can have a glimmer of hope," are particularly painful words. Indeed, like Mr. Wan's father, he does not engage in production and does not consider the family's finances at all. He is already failing the family, but he is not ashamed of himself, and even says such unreasonable things as "I don't care about family affairs, I will smoke until I die." This kind of person is unreasonable and can be said to have no qualifications to be a father or head of the family. Where is there a little bit of love for his children? Therefore, Mr. Wan's "righteous restraint of his father's recklessness" cannot be said to be bad, and we should admire his courage to take the overall situation into account. If he is afraid of the criticism of the common people and believes in the foolish saying that "there are no wrong parents in the world," then it will be really bad. In the future, not only will his brothers bear a heavy burden, but there will also be a danger of running out of food in the family, and I am afraid that his father's smoking will not really be able to "smoke until he dies." In this way, who will benefit? Isn't it a mutual destruction? Therefore, we can never blame Mr. Wan with the traditional "filial piety," although his behavior is out of desperation, and although "there are no relief provisions in the law."</p>
<p>However, since the law has not "stipulated a method" for Mr. Wan, what kind of "appropriate method" should Mr. Wan take? This is worth studying. Of course, there is no such custom in society as "expelling a bad father." If you really do it, I am afraid that a group of "gentlemen" in society will immediately speak out righteously and say that you are a great rebel, or even go to court to sue you. Even if you take a step back, "sending him to a vocational training center for reform" is not possible in reality. The vocational training center will be good enough not to scold you, and would it dare to accept your request? Therefore, Mr. Wan's two methods may not be promising in reality.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Mr. Wan may as well do it this way. Although your father cannot be forgiven, he also has his own difficulties. He will become addicted if he does not smoke, and it is not easy to quit his addiction. Moreover, you think that the family is in a very difficult situation, and that only by reducing clothing and food can you support yourself. In his opinion, it may not be difficult, but he may think that you are holding on to the family property and are unwilling to give it to him for use. Therefore, although Mr. Wan has already had his mother give his father "gentle words" of loyal advice, I am afraid that he still may not believe it. It is best for you to explain to him very sincerely, along with your younger brothers, "the reason why you will not let him smoke anymore." You can explain to him in detail your own income, the family's property, various uses, and the family's future crisis, reasoning with him on the one hand and appealing to his emotions on the other. I think that if he has a bit of humanity, he does not seem to be able to ignore it.</p>
<p>However, I am only speaking based on your letter and human common sense. I do not understand your father's personality or your detailed situation, so the above method may not be effective. Therefore, I will propose another strategy on your behalf, but this is a last resort, and it is best not to use it. Although there is no way to help you under the law now, smoking opium is prohibited. Therefore, you may as well take advantage of this. But the so-called use here does not mean that you should report him to the police station and have your relative arrested and sent to jail. The method is this: after you have given loyal advice, if he is still stubborn, then you can invite close friends to persuade him to go to a public smoking cessation hospital for forced smoking cessation. However, it is difficult for smokers to quit smoking after all, and he may relapse from time to time. Therefore, it is best to separate from him after he quits smoking, or only provide him with some food and clothing expenses, and do not give him the economic power, and do not allow him to "pawn clothes and belongings" or "borrow from others." In this way, he will definitely not be able to affect your economy, and naturally, you will not be burdened by him again.</p>
<p>In short, we treat people and handle affairs with nothing more than "emotion" and "reason," whether it is friends, children, family, or parents. Therefore, you may as well act on these two words for your father. As long as you are "emotional and rational," there is nothing wrong with you being "the great unfilial son in patriarchal society."</p>
<p>Editor's Announcement</p>
<p>To all contributors, the manuscripts received by this publication every day are crowded, and there is really no way to clear them up.

<p>The Story of a Street Urchin (21) by Chen Jingsheng</p>
<p>It turned out that he had stolen a phonograph and went dancing with his mistress and a foreign commander. The young master was very sad.</p>
<p>Novel: Between Flesh and Blood (4) by Manzhi</p>
<p>Sixth Master did not answer immediately. Second Master stared at him with both eyes. Sixth Master said with great indignation and hatred, "I hate him to death! I want to kill him myself!"</p>
<p>"Kill him yourself? A father who kills his son is not guilty, let alone a traitor to the family. Do you have the courage to do this?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I have already made up my mind."</p>
<p>Second Master did not expect Sixth Master to have such determination, and he was very happy. The anger he had just felt immediately disappeared. He walked to the side of the opium bed and sat down. However, the atmosphere in the house became even more serious. All four people were silent. The sound of rain outside the window was particularly loud. Second Master spoke first, "How do you want to kill him?"</p>
<p>"I think it would be easy to shoot him with a revolver, and it would be over before he was wary. However, the sound of the gun would be heard by people outside, and I am afraid that there would be complications. If I poison him with rat poison, I am afraid that he would be wary of the food he eats, and it would not be easy to do. I think like this, I will get him drunk with wine and strangle him alive!"</p>
<p>As Sixth Master spoke, he picked up the water pipe and took a puff of opium. Second Master heard this and grunted in response, nodding his head. It took a long time before he said, "Who will get him drunk with wine? Who will help you strangle him?"</p>
<p>Sixth Master was smoking the water pipe and did not have time to speak. The eldest young master, Liansun, rushed to say, "I am also willing to be the murderer of this traitor to the family."</p>
<p>Second Master glared at his son. Guisun also said, "I am also willing."</p>
<p>Sixth Master exhaled a puff of white smoke, and then said calmly and leisurely, "There is no need for you brothers to be the murderers. I already have an idea. However, you brothers will be needed to get him drunk with wine. Don't you usually drink wine and play finger-guessing games with him? Just play finger-guessing games and drink wine with him, and get him drunk."</p>
<p>Both young masters said in unison, "That's fine too."</p>
<p>Second Master stroked his beard and said, "Then you must hurry!"</p>
<p>Sixth Master replied, "It's too late today, just tomorrow night. Now I have to go home and take a look." He stood up and was about to leave. Liansun said suspiciously, "Why does he want to go home?" Sixth Master said, "Isn't it because the government soldiers are tightening their grip on the countryside and there is nowhere to hide?" Second Master nodded.</p>
<p>Liansun and Guisun sent him to the door. Guisun also went home to eat.</p>

<p>Architectural Supplement: A Glimpse of Traditional Chinese Bridge Architecture (Part 1) by Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>Bridge construction in China has a history of thousands of years. Building bridges over water is an innate ability of mankind. The earliest bridges that can be verified were tall wooden bridges, which were first built in the era of King Zhao of Zhou (1003 BC). During the reign of King Ding of Zhou, pontoon bridges were also built. Later, there were cantilever wooden bridges, and then stone pier wooden surface or stone surface suspension bridges. The most famous one is the arched ring-hole bridge, which is beautiful in style and strong in construction. The earliest one should have started after the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Subsequently, during the Tang Dynasty, Buddhism flourished, and the Yuan ancestors went on expeditions to the west. The architecture of India and Persia was also introduced, so the architecture of Chinese bridges became more advanced. At the same time, the architecture of Chinese bridges also flowed abroad.</p>
<p>The main types of bridge architecture in China are: simple girder bridges, arch bridges, cantilever bridges, and suspension bridges. Among them, the first type of girder bridge is the most common, and the arch bridge is also very popular.</p>
<p>(1) Simple Girder Bridges: There are two types: wood and stone. What we see in rural areas today is still the style of the Han and Tang dynasties. Its long history can be seen. The method of construction is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>First, six or seven laborers are used to hit wooden piles with large stones and press them into the silt in the river. After being driven in five or six feet, the initial stage is completed. Then, wooden bridge piers are supported on top. The thickness and length are determined according to the length of the bridge and the width of the river. After the bridge piers are installed, long bridge beams are erected on top, and the beams are densely covered with wooden boards, arranged tightly and nailed firmly, and the bridge is completed. This is a simple wooden girder bridge.</p>
<p>Later, because wood is susceptible to corrosion, stone strips were used. Generally, the width of the stone strips is about fourteen or fifteen inches. If the river surface is very narrow, one strip is enough. If the river surface is wider, the number of stone strips will increase to four or five. In terms of construction, except for the bridge deck, bridge piers, and bridge abutments, which are all made of stone, the driving of piles is still done with wood.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the span of such simple girder bridges. If the river surface is very wide, the number of spans can be increased. For example, the Jinzhou Prefecture Bridge is 378 feet long and 16 feet wide, and it is built with 47 spans. The span of each span is nearly 80 feet. There are also two long bridges in Zhangzhou Prefecture that are 2,000 feet long and are built on the Cao River. The most famous one should be the long bridge on the Dragon Boat River near Xiamen. Although it is only over 1,100 feet long, the span is only over 70 feet, and the width of the bridge deck is fourteen or fifteen feet, and the weight of the stone strips is up to 200 tons. Thousands of years ago, the equipment was far less complete than it is today. Its carving, lifting, and building were all difficult, but it was still built into such a huge bridge. It can be seen that in ancient times, there seemed to be certain rules for the construction of Chinese bridges. If the thickness of the bridge deck must be one-fifteenth of the total length of the bridge span, it is quite inconvenient to build, but for the sake of the bridge's load-bearing capacity, the ancient people's skills are truly admirable. The tensile force of an ordinary bridge deck is always about 900 pounds per square inch, while the bridge has reached 200 pounds. If you check the high tensile strength of the stone strips, it has exceeded four times, but it is rarely dangerous because of this. It seems that this person will once again praise the ancient people's skills. According to the test results of Helge Fugl-Meyer, the tensile strength of Chinese stone strips varies from 437 to 970 pounds from 5.5 feet to 10.3 feet, which proves that the safety of the ancient people's bridge construction also comes from experience, not by chance.</p>
<p>On Modern Architecture (Continued) by Qin Yi</p>
<p>The interior layout of various houses always varies according to the degree of need. The architecture of store fronts and showrooms is most important for attracting attention, so novel and unique layouts are always more important than adapting to the environment. Inside, practical convenience must be considered, but it should not hinder comfort and aesthetics. When we visit the interiors of modern houses, we often remember the ancient saying "Houses are for living, not for viewing." At first glance, these houses are novel and pleasing, but when considering living in them, we cannot help but feel horrified. The brilliant luster of silver and glass is suitable for shops, but not for homes. Bright and dazzling colors, although trendy, are actually not very suitable. The secret of interior layout is only to make the general public feel sympathetic and feel appropriate, so excellent design does not lie in showing off novelty. It is necessary to feel excited in places such as streets or theaters, but in homes, the first need is a quiet and comfortable layout.</p>
<p>French architects have created a fresh slogan, "That is, houses are machines for living." The use of machines values high efficiency and does not need external attractiveness. But on the other hand, since we work in this machine all day long, we will inevitably find it annoying and need to change the way we live to regulate the air. Therefore, the design of houses should not only pay attention to the effectiveness of living, but also take into account the delicate and comfortable aspects. Any house should not be called an efficient house if its necessary equipment is not complete.</p>
<p>In the history of architecture, England has the most research on the construction of houses. The beauty of the English countryside is recognized worldwide. Its farmhouses, villages, and villas and gardens of officials and nobles all have beautiful architecture to adjust the surrounding environment. These buildings only create elegant buildings naturally with fair prices, simple and non-inherited designs, and in practice do not take on the meaning of "luxury and advertising." Common perceptions believe that residential architecture must be constantly updated to increase perception and interest, but in rural areas, it is necessary to take into account building regulations so that the style of the house and the environment have an adjusted or matched structure.</p>
<p>Observing the history of the architectural world, the progress of architectural art always advances with the times. Any art that lacks new ideas and new inventions will have no progress. If it cannot continue to progress and expand, it will perish. However, the invention of new methods and the proliferation of branches are not necessarily beneficial to themselves. We can use trees as a metaphor: lush branches and leaves are not a symbol of abundant fruits. However, in the season when branches and buds sprout, it must be assumed that the growth of new hope should be promoted as much as possible to make it great.</p>
<p>Modern architecture has many sound advantages in terms of design. The elimination of useless decorations inside and outside, the simplicity of the floor plan layout, and the perfection of lighting, hygiene, and other facilities have greatly increased the convenience of living. However, the habits of ordinary people often like to incorporate inherited old styles into new buildings, so that the advantages of modern architecture are often destroyed by the outdated people. What a pity this is. (End)</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF CUSTOMS NORTH OF THE GREAT WALL</h3>
<p>On the 4th, at 9 p.m., departed from Zhangjiakou, heading to the station. The train from the east was delayed, so I waited on the platform. My friend, Mr. Du Shanqing, and others who came to see me off, spoke about the recent situation in the education of Chahar Province, saying that the regions within Chahar Province are quite different, and the spirit expressed in education is quite inconsistent. The ten counties inside the Great Wall mostly have modern education, while the six counties outside the Great Wall are like medieval education, and the Mongolian border banners are even like ancient education. There are three secondary schools in Zhangjiakou, namely the First Middle School, the Provincial Normal School, and the Women's Normal School. The old agricultural vocational school had already graduated one undergraduate class, three senior high school classes, and six junior high school classes. Now, it has suddenly received an order to close. The school site is being borrowed by the 29th Army's 37th Division headquarters. Although there is a proposal to convert it into a animal husbandry school, there has been no news of preparations so far. The remaining seventh-grade students at the time of closure were merged into the Provincial Normal School, which was opposed by the students of the Provincial Normal School, causing many to be unable to study with peace of mind. The reporter saw the Education Department's written reply when passing by the Education Department yesterday regarding the Provincial Normal School students' opposition to the merger of the agricultural vocational school students. The reasons recorded in the excerpt of the submission were particularly insufficient. Fortunately, the Education Department did not approve it. Considering that there are not many schools in Chahar Province, it is unfortunate that the agricultural vocational school has been closed. From the standpoint of the academic community, deep sympathy and assistance should be given to the restoration movement, and there should be no unfortunate event of submitting a petition to oppose the merger of students. In addition, the Provincial Public Education Hall has been able to do its best to collect exhibits and establish libraries and public schools with limited funds. The director has voluntarily reduced his salary and simplified expenses to add books, which is particularly commendable. I once visited the newspaper reading room established by the hall in Zhongshan Park, where readers arbitrarily spit and talk, so it seems that spittoons should be added, and those who do not follow the rules should be guided.</p>
<p>The train arrived and departed at 9:30. It was crowded and there were no seats, so I squeezed into the dining car. The seats were high and without backrests, making me feel particularly tired. The train had no heating, and the night was very cold. The wind entered through the cracks, and even my fur coat was not warm. There was a merchant in the seat, who seemed to be a member of the underworld. He often pressed objects into the cigarette butt and took deep puffs frequently. Yet, he still tossed and turned, seemingly not satisfied. Then he yawned and dripped with snot, revealing an ugly state. The reporter then asked Mr. Zhao, who had a badge hanging on his chest, about the situation of the opium scourge in the north. Mr. Zhao couldn't help but sigh and say, "The harm of the opium scourge in the north is so great! I (Mr. Zhao referring to himself) am a service person on this route. Please allow me to speak about the examples of the opium scourge obtained on this route. From September of the 17th year of the Republic of China to the end of May of the 20th year of the Republic of China, this route seized more than 16,800 taels of ownerless opium, which was publicly burned by the Beiping Local Court. Since then, there have been no other statistical figures for drug seizures. Is it that opium transport has disappeared, or is there another secluded path? And the degree of addiction, it is not difficult to infer, etc."</p>
<p>At four o'clock the next morning, I arrived in Datong, got off the train, and entered an inn. I lit a stove and warmed the kang, and lay down for a while. It was soon dawn. The so-called "kang" is a platform built in the room, which can burn coal in the middle, and then a brick surface and a mat are placed on it, generating heat. People lie horizontally on it, accommodating up to ten or more people, with their heads out and their feet extending, like rows of scallions. Southerners do not have this habit. At first, lying on it feels like being subjected to the torture of being burned. During the day, the bedding is folded up, and a small square table, about one foot high, two feet wide, and three or four feet long, is placed on it, which can be used for eating, drinking, and writing. When guests arrive, they either sit on the right or remove their shoes and sit cross-legged on it, facing the host across the table to talk. According to old customs, sitting cross-legged on the kang, unless with respected relatives or family members, even if the mat is dusty, one should not take off one's shoes without permission, otherwise, there is a suspicion of insulting the host's wife, and one will immediately be glared at by the hostess. However, this custom is no longer widely practiced in various places today.</p>
<p>It happened to be Qingming Festival that day. Women burned paper on the graves and cried a lot. In the evening, there was also a lot of crying in front of each house. When asked about the situation of other festivals, it was said that on New Year's Day, charcoal is piled up in the door or courtyard, like a pagoda, called "building a旺火". The wealthy have more charcoal and bigger fires, which is particularly fortunate. On the fifth day, colored paper is cut into people, with eggs as their heads, and children hug them and play in the streets, snatching each other, called "sending away poverty". Those who snatch and leave are said to "gain wealth". On the eighth day, it is the birthday of the stars, and monks and Taoists chant scriptures and worship them. Starting three days before the Lantern Festival (15th), the city is decorated with lanterns and streamers, and旺火 are built (in the Kouquan area southwest of the city, where coal is produced, the quality is the best, and each yuan can buy more than 400 catties, so building旺火 and burning stoves are not spared). The four main streets of the county seat are particularly prosperous. In the villages, people dress up with lanterns, Yangge dance, stilt walking, and acrobatics, entering the city to play, with the sound of gongs and drums shaking the sky, not stopping all night. On the 16th, people go on outings, saying they are "removing a hundred diseases". That night, they also worship their ancestors. The 20th is "Little添倉", and the 25th is "Big添倉", adding and buying rice, flour, firewood, charcoal, and other items, and lighting lamps in the storage place, saying they are "illuminating emptiness and waste". On the second day of the second month, the villages hold she gatherings, raising money to offer sacrifices, called "supporting the dragon's head", also known as "the dragon raises its head". They fetch well water with pots and pour it, called "leading the Qinglong". On the third day of the third month, vinegar embryos are made, and swings are played for fun on Qingming Festival. In this month, there are many dragon god temple races, as spring prayers. The autumn report in August is also the same. The eighth day of the fourth month is Buddha's birthday, and people go to Mount Heng to offer incense. On the sixth day of the sixth month, people go on outings in the eastern suburbs, called "踏靑". On this day and the first day of the dog days, people also air their clothes, step on曲, and make wine and soy sauce. On the 23rd, offerings are made to the Guan Yu Temple, with elevated platforms and flower arrangements, and the viewers block the road. On the 15th day of the seventh month, steamed 面人 are made for children to play with. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, people admire the moon, displaying fruits, melons, sweets, and other foods, and exchanging them with each other. Before that, dozens of carts of watermelons are brought into the city from the villages every day, piled up on the four main streets, with green fruits piled up like mountains, impossible to count. By that night, they are all carried away. In September, families store vegetables to prepare for the winter. On the first day of October, paper clothes are cut out and burned, for "sending winter clothes", either at the graves or outside the door. Women cry at night as on Qingming Festival. On the 15th, literati often prepare wine and dishes and watch the moon at midnight as on the Mid-Autumn Festival. On the eighth day of the twelfth month, Laba vinegar is made and ice is stored. Other events, such as the Winter Solstice, New Year's Day, New Year's greetings, sweeping tombs on Qingming and the first day of October, drinking realgar wine and wearing evil-warding charms on the Dragon Boat Festival, begging for skills on the Double Seventh Festival, admiring the moon on the Mid-Autumn Festival, climbing heights on the Double Ninth Festival, and staying up late on New Year's Eve, are roughly the same as in other places.</p>
<h3>CHAOHSIAN VILLAGERS RESIST ERADICATION OF OPIUM SEEDLINGS. ORGANIZE RED AND YELLOW SPEAR SOCIETIES AND OPEN FIRE WITH GOVERNMENT TROOPS. ADDITIONAL WUHOU SECURITY TEAMS SENT TO SUPPRESS THE REBELLION</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Villagers in the western countryside of Chaohsian County, Anhui Province, and the Zhegao Township bordering Hefei, secretly planted opium seedlings, stretching for miles. Provincial Chairman Liu Zhenhua, in order to strictly prohibit the root of the poison, specially telegraphed Wang Baozhai, the administrative commissioner of the Second District of Wuhu, ordering him to assemble the Second Security Detachment of Wuhu, the Third Security Detachment, the trainees of the first and second classes of the Security Team, and the First Security Detachment of Wuwei County to proceed to Chaohsian County to supervise the eradication. After the security teams arrived in Zhegao, they learned that the villagers had organized Red Spear and Yellow Spear Societies, numbering in the thousands, and intended to resist on the grounds of livelihood. Hu Peigeng, the deputy commander of the Second District Security, who led the security team, and the deputy team leader, Ren Sen, believing that the villagers were ignorant, tried to enlighten them in various ways, hoping they would come to their senses, and hoped that the villagers would elect responsible personnel to organize opium eradication teams to eradicate the opium themselves. The 200 laborers hired by the Chaohsian County government were also willing to join in the assistance. At the same time, provincial inspectors Qiao Guangping and opium eradication commissioner Jiang Shitong had all gathered in Zhegao to discuss solutions. Unexpectedly, today (the 14th), the chief of the political police team of the Chaohsian County government, Wei Qingchang, rushed to Wuhu to report to Commissioner Wang that the Red Spear and Yellow Spear Societies in the area had colluded with no less than 10,000 ignorant villagers and dared to rely on their numbers to resist, so the security team had no choice but to take effective measures to disband the masses who disregarded their interests by force. A conflict broke out immediately, resulting in deaths and injuries. The Red and Yellow Spear Societies were essentially composed of scattered people when disbanded, and gathered as a society when united. Their nature was a haphazard gathering, and they were easily dispersed. However, after Commissioner Wang received the report, in order to seek a quick solution, he again transferred the First Security Detachment of Wuhu to Chaohsian by special ship overnight to assist in the suppression and eradication. (14th)</p>
<h3>SONGJIANG: TAX INSPECTION OF HOME-BREWED WINE PROVOKES PUBLIC ANGER</h3>
<p>The Home-Brewed Wine Tax Inspection Office of this county previously dispatched inspectors Hu Jingqiu and Chen Guyi to Zhangze to investigate home-brewed wine. When they arrived at the homes of Gu Daguan, Gu Huitang, Gu Huogeng, Xie Pinjing, Wang Jinhai, and others in Yaowang Village, they searched arbitrarily and meticulously. Then they went to the homes of Gu Huasiwu in the eighth district and Qian Siwusiwu in the twenty-seventh district. Because each had two wine pots, they were each fined dozens of yuan. The citizens of the area believed that the inspectors were acting recklessly and greedily, without fear of the law, and therefore were greatly angered. They submitted a petition to the local administrative officer, requesting that they be demoted, and forwarded to the provincial government for thorough investigation according to the law, in order to appease the people.</p>
<h3>COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO BUILD AN AUDITORIUM</h3>
<p>The Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce originally had a Western-style auditorium, but because the location was narrow, it could not accommodate every representative conference. The executive committee has resolved to build it on the original site of Bingjing Hall. Contractor Bao Guiji started construction today. It is estimated that the project will be completed before the second second membership representative conference in July this year, at which time more than 300 representatives can be fully accommodated.</p>
<h3>WUXI: POLICE CHIEF RESIGNS AND GOES TO SHANGHAI</h3>
<p>Li Wengong, the chief of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, has been involved in the cases of Liu Zhuomin, the former chief of the Second Sub-bureau, refusing to hand over his duties, Li Shuyun, the wife of the head of the Civil Affairs Department, soliciting bribes under false pretenses, and Gu Renfa's bigamy, causing a great uproar. Gu Renfa has since resigned as a result, and Li has also taken a negative attitude. He then went to the province to present his case to the provincial department, blaming himself and asking to leave. After returning to Wuxi, he formally submitted his resignation to the county government yesterday and left Wuxi for Shanghai. Before a new person takes over the bureau affairs, the superintendent Zhang Yu will act as an agent. The county party department has repeatedly received reports from various parties that since Chief Li resigned, gambling and prostitution have been openly rampant, no one is responsible for local order. Yesterday, he specially sent a letter to the county government requesting that a successor be appointed quickly, and that the current chaotic state of the Public Security Bureau be dealt with urgently to avoid unexpected incidents.</p>
<h3>LIU ZHUOMIN IS ACCUSED AGAIN</h3>
<p>Liu Zhuomin, the former chief of the Second Public Security Sub-bureau, was detained by the county court for refusing to hand over his duties and obstructing official business, which caused the great turmoil of Gu Renfa and Li Shuyun. The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Liu Zhuomin also released traffickers for bribes while in office. The province ordered the county government to forward the letter to the court for investigation and handling according to law, involving Sun Zhongjie, a member of the Third Public Security Sub-bureau (formerly a member of the sub-bureau). Yesterday, Chief Qian ordered Sun Zhongjie and police officer Xia Hongwen, as well as the detained Liu Zhuomin, to appear in court for questioning. He ordered Liu Zhuomin to be returned to custody and ordered the others to return and await review.</p>
<h3>JIADING: SECTION MEMBER TEMPORARILY REPLACES DISTRICT CHIEF</h3>
<p>Yang Jinggu, the district chief of the Fourth District Office, was accused of resigning and was approved by the county government early on. Because there was no suitable successor, the replacement was delayed. Because Yang was eager to hand over, County Magistrate Xu commissioned Ouyang Zinan, a Hunanese member of the First Section, to take over temporarily. However, Ouyang has not taken office because he is unfamiliar with the area.</p>
<h3>CHANGZHOU: HIGH COURT SENDS PERSONNEL TO SUPERVISE THE BURNING OF OPIUM</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Court will burn all the opium, opium paraphernalia, and drugs confiscated in various cases from January to December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, which are very large in number, in public at the public stadium at 1:00 p.m. on the 16th, and requested the High Court to send personnel to supervise. The High Court sent She Zhulan to Changzhou in advance, staying at the Dacheng Hotel. Yesterday (16th) afternoon, he personally went to supervise the burning. Many representatives from various agencies and organizations and the public went to visit.</p>
<h3>POLICE FORCE EXPANDED AND REORGANIZED</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Police Force was ordered to expand into a large team of two squadrons. After County Magistrate Cai submitted it to the political affairs meeting for approval, he specially ordered Mao Gangsheng, the original police captain, to prepare for the expansion. Captain Mao specially reorganized and established it yesterday (16th). Mao Gangsheng was promoted to the post of team leader of the large team. The other squadron leaders and squad leaders have been appointed by County Magistrate Cai, respectively, to engage in training.</p>
<h3>ZHENJIANG: FIRST DAY OF THE PROVINCIAL SECURITY CONFERENCE</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Security Conference was held in the auditorium of the Security Department at 8:00 a.m. yesterday (15th). More than 100 members and representatives attended. Director Xiang presided over the ceremony, first stating the significance of convening the conference, then reporting the conference procedure, and finally stating his hopes for the security of the province in the future. After the opening ceremony, a preparatory meeting was held. Starting at 3:00 p.m., group review meetings were held in various districts. After the review meeting was completed at 5:00 p.m., a convener's meeting was held, which did not end until after 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>YANGZHOU: RESIDENTS ALONG THE CANAL PLAN TO BUILD A HAN STELE</h3>
<p>Since the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the canal embankment has breached in 27 places in one day, and the disaster was extremely tragic. Later, Mr. Han Guojun, a respected elder, took charge of the repair, which took half a year to complete. The residents along the canal deeply felt that Mr. Han had made a great contribution to Jiangsu and Anhui, and advocated the construction of a stele pavilion at the Yidu wharf of Chenjiagou, the first of the six locks south of Shaobo in this county, to commemorate him. It is said that the construction of this stele will cost more than 2,000 yuan, in addition to the 700 yuan donated by Dongtai and Taizhou counties, the rest will be shared by various counties.</p>
<h3>DEPARTMENT AND BUREAU: SURVEY OF CANAL SPRING REPAIRS</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau commissioned Bao En and Fu Yan to accompany Gu Houen, a member of the Construction Department, to the Huai and Si sections to re-evaluate the spring repair project this year. It has now been completed and returned to the bureau to report. Specially held a meeting with the committee to present the case to the department for instructions. Today (14th), the Construction Department again commissioned Commissioner Chen to come to Yangzhou and meet with County Magistrate Ma at the county government.</p>
<h3>NANTONG: COTTON CONTROL COMMITTEE INVESTIGATES TEXTILE FACTORIES</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Commission sent a committee to investigate the situation of cotton textile factories across the country. The East China team, led by team leader Wang Zisu, accompanied by Zhang Angqian, Su Yanbin, and Yu Yipo, came to Nantong and went to Tangzha and Changle Town to investigate the Dasheng No. 1, 2, and 3 factories. After completing the matters in Nantong, they went to Zhejiang Province.</p>
<h3>UNIFY PUBLIC SECURITY EXPENSES IN THE COUNTY</h3>
<p>After the Nantong County Public Security Bureau was reduced to nine offices, the public security expenses were offset by the public security mu tax, which was still more than 10,000 yuan short. In order to prevent corruption, the county government strictly prohibited each district from raising funds on its own, and specially collected the police donations recognized by merchants in each district by the county, and sent a committee to clear and organize them.</p>
<h3>FUNING: ENTIRE FAMILY POISONED TO DEATH FROM MISTAKENLY EATING OPIUM SEEDLINGS</h3>
<p>In Datou, in the northwest of this county, a poor man named Zhang's son went to the field on the 12th to look for wild vegetables to fill his hunger. Unexpectedly, he mistakenly recognized the opium seedlings in a field belonging to someone as shepherd's purse, brought them back and poured them into a pot to cook porridge. After the entire family of five finished eating the porridge, each person suddenly felt dizzy and nauseous and difficult to bear. Neighbors called a doctor to rescue them, but to no avail. The entire family was poisoned to death. When County Magistrate Li heard the news, he sternly rebuked the district head of the second district for neglecting his duties, since it had been reported that the opium seedlings in each district had been cleared. He also ordered the arrest and interrogation of the opium seedling planting households in the village.</p>
<h3>JIASHAN: NEWS OF THE MURDER OF RESIDENT YANG XIUYAN</h3>
<p>Yang Xiuyan, a resident of this county, once served as a member of the Supervisory Committee of the County Party Department and the county magistrate of Tongxiang County. Three years ago, he went to Gansu at the invitation of Shao Lizi and successively served as the director of the Black Mouth and Suzhou Special Tax Bureau. Last year, he also served as the superintendent of Jiayuguan. Recently, the county government suddenly received a telegram from Lanzhou, and at the same time, Lu Chujue in Jiaxing also received a telegram from Pingfan, stating that Yang had been killed and requesting that the family of Yang be notified to go to Suzhou to handle the funeral. Yang's family has telegraphed to Suzhou and Wan County Magistrate of Gulang County to inquire about the truth.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>HUANG FU ARRIVES IN SHANGHAI FROM JIANGXI YESTERDAY MORNING. MEETS WITH JOURNALISTS AND DISCUSSES THE SITUATION IN NORTH CHINA. STAYS IN SHANGHAI FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS BEFORE GOING TO MOGAN MOUNTAIN. RETURNS TO BEIPING IN TWO WEEKS TO RESUME DUTIES.</h3>
<p>Huang Fu, the chairman of the Administrative Yuan's Resident Ping Political Reorganization Committee, has expressed his weariness due to the difficulty of handling affairs. He went south to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on the situation in North China. Wang Jingwei, the president of the Executive Yuan, also rushed to meet with him to discuss countermeasures. After Huang was repeatedly comforted and persuaded by Chiang and Wang, his intention to resign is expected to be dispelled. Huang arrived in Shanghai from Jiangxi by new ship yesterday morning. He plans to stay in Shanghai for three or four days, then go to Hangzhou and Jiaxing to sweep the tombs, and then go to Mogan Mountain to rest. He will return to the north in about two weeks. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, Huang met with reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers at his residence to discuss the situation in North China. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>ARRIVED IN SHANGHAI YESTERDAY MORNING</h3>
<p>After Huang met with President Wang and Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, he and consultant Ge Zhongxin, as well as attendants Wang Dagang, He Qiwei, Gao Shiluan, and others, a total of five people, left Jiangxi on the Jiangxin wheel of the China Merchants Bureau on the morning of the 14th and drove east past Beijing and Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th. The wheel arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 10:00 yesterday morning. The city's Public Security Bureau and the water patrol team sent armed police officers to the port to protect him. Huang's old subordinates, such as Xu Jishi, also went to the wharf to welcome him. Before the wheel was docked at the wharf, Huang boarded the city's Public Security Bureau's small wheel and went ashore first. He took his own car and returned to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. After Huang returned to his residence, Tang Youren, the vice minister of foreign affairs, sent Secretary Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit and inquire about him due to illness. Huang Boqiao, the director of the two road bureaus, Shen Yi, the director of the Municipal Works Bureau, Geng Jiaji, the secretary of the municipal government, and Huang's relatives and friends, also visited to reminisce about the past.</p>
<h3>MET WITH REPORTERS</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after Huang arrived in Shanghai, he notified the newspapers and agreed to meet with reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers at his residence at 3:30 p.m. to make an important statement. More than 50 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers arrived. Huang was wearing a dark blue suit yesterday and looked thinner than before. After he came out, he answered the reporters' questions in order, saying that he was ordered to go north to preside over political affairs in North China in this month last year, which has been more than a year. He has the determination to see benevolence and see wisdom to do things for the party and the country, so he dares not say that he has done some things during his term of office. Only facts can be checked, and he feels that the advantages and disadvantages of doing one thing must have two kinds of observations in the eyes of others. The first kind only looks at the present and does not care about the future, and the second kind cares about the future. Therefore, there is a difference between the present and the future in the distinction between advantages and disadvantages, and it is difficult to obtain a standard for right and wrong for a while.</p>
<h3>TRIP TO JIANGXI</h3>
<p>Huang continued to talk about his trip south to Jiangxi, where he met with Wang and Chiang, and reported on the international situation and the future of the country, as well as various matters in North China. The issues of through trains, through mail, and the establishment of checkpoints at various ports were not raised for discussion separately. He also felt that it was difficult to work in his current position, and his spirit and body were exhausted. He deeply hoped that the central government would understand and implore the central government to hand over this important position in North China to the people of the country to share the burden and save the country from danger. Such a large country should not entrust this extremely important position to one or two people. After consulting with Wang and Chiang, he was granted a two-week vacation. The date of returning north will be determined after two weeks.</p>
<h3>SITUATION IN NORTH CHINA</h3>
<p>Regarding the situation in North China, there have been many rumors recently, and it is impossible to determine what is true. In fact, many of the rumors do not match the facts. Japan has not recently put forward any major demands in North China in fact, but there are many piecemeal demands. Therefore, there have been no major incidents between China and Japan in North China in the past year. There are a total of 19 divisions of the Northeast Army in North China. Since Zhang Hanqing returned to China, 9 divisions have been transferred south, so there are currently six divisions of Wan Fulin's troops and four divisions of Yu Xuezong's troops in North China. Huang continued to say that every time he went south, people asked him about North China's diplomacy, which was difficult to answer. Diplomacy is the overall diplomacy of our country, and there is no distinction between North China and South China.</p>
<h3>WAR ZONE, AGRICULTURE, AND RELIEF ZONE</h3>
<p>As for the relief and follow-up matters in the disaster areas of North China, there were hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Tianjin and Beijing after the war, and they have been sent back one after another, so the urgent relief work has been completed. Now that the time has come for cultivation, the agricultural relief work is urgent. It has now been started and Chen, who previously presided over the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, has been hired to preside over everything. However, the disaster area in North China is vast, and the relief funds are only four to five million yuan, which is a drop in the bucket. As for the internal rebellions in North China, there have been eight in total, which have now been quelled one by one, which is of great significance to the administration and the local area, because the people can live and work in peace. Huang also said that the construction in North China is also in progress. The telephone between Malanyu Xing and Yutian can be connected within a week, and other places will also be promoted in order. As for Japanese military officers going to various important places in North China for reconnaissance, these events have not started today, and it is feared that they are not limited to North China. Since he has been in charge of political affairs in North China, he has heard about them repeatedly, so sitting in the office every day is like sitting on pins and needles and having thorns on his back.</p>
<h3>RETURN TO HOMETOWN TO SWEEP TOMBS</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked whether he would meet with Japanese envoy Ariyoshi Akira during this trip to Shanghai. He replied that mutual visits are common, and there is a possibility of meeting. He will also visit the ambassadors in Shanghai. He plans to stay in Shanghai for three or four days, then go to Hangzhou and Jiaxing to sweep the tombs, because he was ordered to go north last year and did not sweep the tombs, so he must go this year, and he will also go to Mogan Mountain to stay temporarily and spend this two-week vacation.</p>
<h3>WRITTEN STATEMENT</h3>
<p>Huang Fu issued a written statement last night, saying that he has been ordered to serve in North China in the midst of crisis since May last year, and it has been almost a year now. The situation during this year, the facts are all there, and there is no need to explain it again. Although people have different opinions, the heart to take responsibility for the country and reduce the national disaster has been the same from beginning to end. During this trip south to report on his duties, people from all walks of life who care about national affairs asked about the diplomacy of North China. He believes that diplomacy is an overall issue for a country, so it is still possible to say if asked about the local situation in North China or the economic situation in North China. If talking about diplomacy in North China, it is impossible to establish this term at all. He has followed the central government's intentions in all matters related to foreign affairs, and there is no such thing as North China's diplomacy. Although under today's circumstances, the diplomatic issues related to North China are particularly urgent, this is the fact. As for internal affairs, construction and reorganization cannot be talked about, but the reorganization of miscellaneous troops, the reception of war zones, the settlement of refugees, and the promotion of relief work are complicated and difficult. Now, both internally and externally, it is considered relatively stable. He feels that his energy is exhausted, and he very much wants to rest his shoulders in time, but the central government is again responsible for the righteousness, and he has not been allowed to do so immediately, so he plans to return to his hometown to sweep the tombs and rest a little.</p>
<h3>SUN KE TALKS ABOUT THE DIPLOMATIC ISSUES OF NORTH CHINA. THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN HAS NO SUGGESTIONS</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society asked Sun Zhesheng, the president of the Legislative Yuan, about everything at 10 a.m. yesterday because the North China issue is serious and foreign newspapers have reported that the Nanchang Conference has decided to give Huang Fu the authority to negotiate. The Legislative Yuan meeting last week had discussed this. (Reporter asked) What is the real situation in North China and what are the government's countermeasures? (Sun replied) The real situation in North China is the enemy's threat and intimidation. I am not a responsible person, so I cannot know the details. I do not yet know the details of our countermeasures. (Reporter asked) Foreign newspapers have reported that the Nanchang Conference has decided on the method of negotiating through trains and mail. It is not necessarily entirely accurate. If this is the case, it is extremely dangerous to seek solutions by piece. What is your opinion? (Sun replied) If it is as reported, it is very dangerous, but it is not necessarily true. (Asked) At the secret meeting of the Legislative Yuan last week, it was said that there were some suggestions on the diplomatic issues of North China. (Answer) After the members of the Legislative Yuan heard the rumors of diplomatic negotiations in North China, they asked for definite information. Because they did not yet know the exact situation, there were no so-called suggestions. (Asked) At the Legislative Yuan meeting this Friday, it was said that President Wang of the Executive Yuan will be asked to attend and report. Is this true? (Answer) Not yet determined.</p>
