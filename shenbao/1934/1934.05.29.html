<p>時評</p>
<h3>提倡全民體育廷</h3>
<p>西哲嘗曰。「物競天。擇適者生存。」至理名言。顚撲不破。我中華民族當此非常之危機。殆已至最後掙扎之階段。適與不適。視今而斷。然而大半國民。乘積弱之餘。精神萎靡。體格衰落。腐敗之嗜好。不良之習慣。重得剥蝕。層層包圍。循至朝氣沉淪。良知埋滅。直不覺本身之可貴。寗論國家。此其現象。已臻普遍。而體育事業之落伍。正爲必然的反映之一端。所謂天然淘汰之禍。其將何由而免。不容不深長思也。</p>
<p>嘗考我國近代體育事業之提倡。蓋始於遜淸光緒二十三年（一八九七。）</p>
<p>時當中日甲午戰後有識之士。深知救亡之精神。庽於强健之身體。故對體育一門。開始注意。然各學校因狃於尙武救國之說。祗側重機械式的兵操。自此以外仍無所謂體育。嗣經教會學校之提倡。始由專用體操之單軌制。而進爲兼重運動之雙軌制。不可謂非一大進步。惜年來體育事業之活動範圍。仍限於少數學校。而全國運動界。亦完全爲學生勢力所獨占。體育不能與民衆打成一片。乃致形成畸形發展之局面。除養成寥寥可數之選手人材。作崇拜英雄心理者之頌贊對象外。不獨不於國家社會發生良好之影響。甚且間接鼓勵個人患得患失之虚榮引起運動塲上爭鬧兇毆之風潮。說者乃謂自革命北伐至今日。爲我國體育之危險時期。洵非虚語。</p>
<p>欲矯斯弊。不可不與全體國民以充分平均發展之機卽政府當道亦早知之矣。如民十六全國體育指導委員會之成立。民十八國民體育法之擬訂。民二十一全國體育會議之召集。曁國民體育實施方案之公布。何一非以增進全民健康復興民族精神爲號召者。然體育界之具體成績。除開若干次以學界爲代表之運動會外。始終無多表見。且卽以運動會而言。世界運動會自創始迄今。已有十屆。我國惟於上屆派遣代表一人參加。言乎得分希望。尙不知在何年月。遠東運動會自舉行以來。我國亦祗於第二屆（一九一五年）一度榮膺冠軍。其後乃一蹶不振。田徑賽成績。自第四屆（一九一九）後。每况愈下。更使人氣短。此其關鍵實不在各選手技能之高下。而在全民體育程度之低落。固爲識者所共知。然則負提倡體育之責者。當知所以挽救之道矣。</p>
<p>顧言夫挽救之道。正無須好高鶩遠。但就政府旣發表之計劃與方案。擇要實行。其效已不勝言。舉其原則綱要。有如下述。</p>
<p>（一）關於民衆者。積極提倡業餘運動。各縣於縣城至少設立公共體育塲一所。逐漸推至市鎭鄉村。每年春季（四月至六月）或秋季（九月至十一月）舉行業餘運動會一次或二次。惟各地鄉村。習慣不同。農民有無餘暇從事於體育。何種教材最爲適宜。尙應詳加研究。然後决定。我國各地方鄉村固有之團體活動。如北方之雙石頭會。南方之划龍船等。個人活動。如踢鍵子。要石鎖等。鄉士遊戲。如捉迷藏。指星玩月等。各有體育値。大可應用科學方法及教育原理。加以改良至於城市居民。則應時時提倡郊遊·射獵·野餐·遠足旅行等習慣。</p>
<p>（二）關於學校者體育一科不以養成運動選手爲目的。應以全體學生共同運動普遍發展體育爲宗旨。專科以上學校。體育課程每星期二小時。不及格者。不得升學或畢業。中小學及師範學校。依照教育部暫行課程標凖辦理。不及格者。亦不得升學或畢業。各學校之體育成績。分别由中央及地方教育主管機關。負考成之責。</p>
<p>夫爲政不在多言。而但貴乎實行。體育事業。有關係整個民族之存亡。尤不應出之以敷衍粉飾手段。吾人敢拭目以俟上舉兩大目的之完成焉。</p>
<h3>海軍預備會議　日本反對涉及遠東政治　决定參加條件五項　堅持平等推翻比率　態度强硬以退會相恫嚇</h3>
<p>（東京）日本政府决於日内正式决定參加倫敦爲中心之軍縮初步談判、在正式答復英國之前、日外務省已考慮談判策、卽初步談判時、不准提及遠東問題、如僞滿國之成立是否違反九國條約、此問題絶對不准討論、又四月十七日外務省聲明中、日本爲維持東亞和平之唯一責任者等宗旨、日本認爲極正當之聲明、故此事亦不准討論、廣田外相爲使駐外外交使節明瞭此事、已於昨日向駐英松平·駐美齋藤等各大公使發出訓電如下、</p>
<p>一九三五年之海軍軍縮會議、係根據倫敦條約所規定而開會、當係决定海軍兵力之純粹會議、故應除該項兵力以外、凡屬東亞各種問題、倘作爲議題而行使討論、殊有埋没此項會議之本來性質、日本政府斷不能承認、設使無理取鬧、竟將該種問題提出於預備會議、作爲議事程序、則日本卽脫離軍縮會議、亦在所不辭、（二十七日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於海軍軍縮會議豫備交涉開始問題、廣田外相所擬參加之條件、二十九日得閣議之承認後、卽正式回答、至日本政府所主張之五大原則如下、（一）軍備均等權之原則確立、卽一國之國防兵力量及軍備、須適應國情而决定之、非他國所能限制其數量者、（一）比率主義之再檢討、卽比率主義事實上徒使一二國爲數量的軍擴、故帝國主張不依比率、認爲有努力發見新軍縮方式之必要、（一）局部的特别恊定、卽適應各國地理的地位與近隣國之特殊事情、及各種艦船之特殊性能、除依艦種别爲量的制限外、凡利害關係密接之國家間、須設定關於乙種巡洋艦·驅逐艦·潛水艦之量的制限、爲局地的特别恊定、因此世界海軍國須區分爲太平洋組·大西洋組·歐洲組·及南美組、除一般恊定外、再設特别恊定、（一）攻繫的艦船之全廢、卽國防之原則、在於攻不足而守有餘之謂、日本認有全廢威脅非戰鬥員之航空母艦之必要、（一）太平洋防備制限地域之擴大無戰爭之危機、而增設軍事根據地、徒挑發各國間之猜疑而爲紛糾之原因、故信太平洋之武裝、有於可能範圍内解除之必要、希望英美方面承認將布哇·菲律賓·新嘉坡等、亦包含在防備制限地域之中、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）海軍省定六月一日令第一航空戰隊司令官山本五十六少將、轉補軍令部出任、兼海軍省出任、其後任以霞浦航空隊司令官和田秀穗少將補之、山本少將有出席倫敦會議之經騐、將任爲下屆軍縮會議首席隨員、今后專研究軍縮對策、日内將任爲軍縮凖備委員會委員、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<h3>美國聲明立場　願參加倫敦談判　主張一般的妥協</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務卿赫爾官稱、美國政府不擬在華盛頓與各關係國進行初步談判、以計論一九三五年海軍會議之議程·日期及地點、赫爾並謂英國提議之倫敦談話、已足使問題趨於簡易、以渠所見、無庸分作兩次談話云（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本駐美大使齋藤、曾自動拜訪國務卿赫爾、談話時赫爾告以美國凖備在倫敦進行雙方談話、以籌備明年海軍會議、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約民聲論壇報載稱、關於海軍會議籌備問題、一方英國與美國、一方日本與英國、將在倫敦分别舉行談話、但昨日國務卿赫爾與日本駐美大使齋藤會晤時、曾商定兩國與第三國談話時、關於限制海軍問題、無論取得何種同意、彼此均須互相知照、所以如此者、蓋欲避免一九三○年倫敦會議之意外事件、緣一九三○年英美兩國雖事先商午同意、然事後英法與意大利之間、卒發生困難、以致一般討論爲之停頓、結果僅成立部分妥恊、此次不宜使此種意外、再度發生、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法接受英請書　特别關心德整海軍　安全担保不容退讓</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法政府已接受英政府之請書、决定參加一九二二年華盛頓公約四簽字國間之海軍預會、據今日消息、談話將爲雔馼性質、由尋常外交途徑進行之、聞法政府對此初步談判、極爲重視、其所討論者、將不僅爲手續問題、而海軍限制難題之基本要點、亦將議及、據法國辯論報稱、法政府必欲在可能範圍内最好狀况中參加此項甚複雜之談判、一九二二年法國在華府會議時、因缺少凖備而接受之不圓滿條件、應爲前車之鑒、再一九二二年德國海軍未曾議及、今則事變情遷、或有驚人發展云、法國急進報稱、法國已臻軍縮之極點、苟無安全新担保、不能再退讓一步云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>意相重要表示　續撥巨欵擴充軍備　絶對不信永久和平</h3>
<p>羅馬意國已决定續撥巨欵、爲海軍與空軍經費、意相墨索里尼今日在衆院夏季休會以前發表重要言論、謂意政府將撥付海軍與空軍特别經費各十萬萬列拉、分六個月撥付、以供更新之用、世界復興大部份繫於政治問題、厥爲薩爾·多瑙河·與遠東之時局及軍縮事件云、墨氏繼曰、余絶對不信有永久和平、人的根本能力、唯賴奮鬥而始能於日光中有所表現、若永久和平、則銷毁人的根本能力、而適與之相反云、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<h3>日海軍要求龐大預算</h3>
<p>（東京）昭和九年度預算之重大問題、根據補充海軍計畫之兵備改善費、於昭和十年度預算如建造補助艦艇、增設航空隊等主要部份、將依然繼續記入、且一九三五·六年之危局已迫切、加以國際情勢日見緊張、致海軍預算復成重要問題、因此於十年度亦必有龐大之新要求、尤其因水雷艇友鶴遭難、要求增大艦艇復原力、在海軍乃絶對必要者、因此十年度之改裝費增額、必頗鉅大、大藏省主計局亦早見及、正在講究對策中、卽海軍省因增大復原力、對於業已建造之水雷艇四隻及屬於第二次補充計畫之五千噸以下諸艦艇、並旣成之主力艦·巡洋艦·亦意圖改裝費、故其經費之鉅必可驚無疑、於是海軍省與大藏省之交涉、於十年度預算之編成必爲重大問題（廿七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）日海軍部稱、日海軍航空力量比英美單薄、不能戰勝英美、故定自一九三四年起至一九三六年止、三年間培養航空人材一千五百人、新造水上機之航空母艦、一萬噸之母艦三隻、定於一九三六年中完成、（二十七日華聯電）</p>
<h3>日陸軍整陣容　菱刈内調軍參議　有南次郎繼任說</h3>

<h3>日海軍元老東鄉病殆　曾參與俄日之役　海戰紀念大爲減色</h3>
<p>（東京）今日全國慶祝對馬海峽海軍大戰第二十九週年紀念、而當日建立殊勳之元老東鄉大將適以病篤聞、致大爲減色、按東鄉自去夏攖疾、久困牀第、近已喉管炎、病勢轉劇、其年已八十有六、故衆極爲之憂慮、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>依蘭義軍擊落日機三架　缺乏彈藥待援正急</h3>

<h3>軍縮最後掙扎且觀總委會開會結果　俄草新方案歐陸合作爲本　北中歐小國主維軍備現狀　英圖出全力促成空軍公約</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會議定廿九日開會、最近數種發展、已引起工作仍照舊日輪廓進和、而目的則不若前之遠大之希望、第一發展爲蘇俄現正草擬一種方案、而法國已允予以贊助、該方案以歐陸合任爲本、規定侵略國之界說、並對違約者之制裁、聞該方案極有伸縮性、如不能訂成一般的條約、則尙可訂成區域的條約云、第二發展爲斯坎锹那維亞半島三國與瑞士西班牙代表團所提出之方案、主張各國之軍備以目前者爲限、今後商定軍備休戰若干年、比較意國之建議已大有進展、衆意軍縮會主席漢德森或將贊助此方案、數方面之意見以爲軍縮會美國旁聽員台維斯奉羅總統之特别訓令、將主張訂一監管軍備之具體條約、惟日本或將反對此議、第三發展爲英國力圖挽救空軍公約淪於失敗、聞英外相西門雖不欲提出關於此事之任何切實建議、但英國代表團必將熱切贊助任何與此有關之倡議云、（廿六日路透電）</p>

<h3>台維斯巴爾都懇談</h3>
<p>（巴黎）台維斯與巴爾都今日午後在巴黎作長談、皆主竭力使軍縮會議生存、並使恢復健康、二人曾討論關於此節之各種手續方式、但未有任何决議、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）外長巴爾都與美國軍縮代表台維斯會晤時、曾考慮五月二十九日軍縮總委員會之工作程序、而研究種種解决辦法、經討論之後、似覺總委員會不能繼續工作、因國聯會行政院委託該委員會之任務、在於「縮减並限制軍備、」顧目下該委員會所有之軍縮公約草案不過兩種、卽英國與意大利之備忘錄是也、然兩種備忘錄皆贊成允許德國擴充軍備、殊覺軼出行政院賦與總委員會之任務以外、情形如此、則軍縮會議主席漢德森或須向國聯會行政院說明總委員會不能完成其所由組織之任務、行政院處此、或則另行組織一種新委員會、賦以新任務、而使美俄加入、或則勸令各關係國根據新基礎、再行從事雙方談判、總之時至今日、欲求成立公約、其最合理之辦法、惟有由總委員會將其任務交還國聯行政院之一法、如須變更軍縮會議之目的或採取新方法、均可由行政院决定之、但此不過爲一種推論、旣非法國有此意向、更不能認爲法國有此建議也（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>秦君子略歷</h3>
<p>秦君江蘇嘉定定人、爲數理家秦沅之長公子、財次秦汾之姪、畢業於吳淞水產學校、交通部檢定甲種船長、歷任江海各輪船長大二副等職、對於航海之學識與經騐、甚爲豐富、十五六歲、卽已從事海上生活、當初任船長時、年祗二十餘、不及外國老船主之半數、故常戲稱君爲娃娃船長、近辭去民生實業公司船長職、以其十五六年來所得之航海經騐與學識、專心研究、而發明「重向一綫船位圖」及「錚如式距離儀」、以供航海界之需要、最近仍將從事海上生活、</p>
<h3>原理及應用</h3>
<p>「重向一綫船位圖」、係以一點爲圓心、一爲半徑、作一圓、再以一爲半徑之單位作連續之同心圓、過圓心作二垂綫、以定東南西北、再分成三十二方位、一百二十八瓜脫（一方位之四分之一）、今假定有一船在航行中見一燈山、先測其方向、航行若干浬後、再測燈山之方向、卽可於圖上求得船之位置、應用時以測得燈山之第一第二方向及航行之方向（針路）、將鉛筆於圖中之方位綫行上圈出之、在針路上自中心數起以一圈作一浬、航行若干浬、則數至第若干圈、以筆點出之、而作第一方向之平行綫、與第二方向之交點、卽船舶之位置、自此交點向中心數去、所得之圈數、卽船舶與燈山相距之浬數也、該圖祇須劃一綫、卽可求之、故所費時間、約七秒至十五秒、不若其他解法費數分鐘或尙未得結果也、如欲作極精密之解答、則不以四份之一點爲方向之單位、而改用度數、卽將全周分爲三百六十度、加作一經度之比例綫、且可求得船舶之經緯度云、「錚如式距離儀」爲甲乙丙三支尺所製成、甲乙二尺之一端、以活釘連結之、而能開合活動、丙尺之一端連於甲尺、可沿之移動、并可向四週旋轉、應用時以甲尺指燈山之第一次方向、乙尺指第二次方向、丙尺指航行之方向、而丙尺上所刻之尺度示航行之路程、以所需之方向及尺度、將丙尺移動之與甲乙二尺之相交處所示之尺度、卽在觀測時船與燈山之距離也、當使用之時、甚感便利與迅速、該距離儀并可以之替代三桿分度儀、亦可以之求相交方位法、（ＣrossＢearing）一像可三用、現正在添製中、以備航海界之採用、並擬送往英國航海學會、俾全世界航海界均蒙大利、</p>

<h3>劉書蕃等被控案續訊</h3>
<p>前郵政儲金匯業總局長劉書蕃等、被控一案、昨經第一特區地方法院審結、已誌本報、據悉該案係分兩部分、（一）爲劉書蕃任内上海儲匯分局經理任嗣達經手爲遜記户代收公債之部、（一）爲楊建平任内與招保山·楊培昌·等因買地浮報產價收受巨額佣金之部、檢察官鍾淸先向法庭陳述偵查情形、並對劉書蕃之部分、謂倘被告能舉出遜記確非劉氏之反證、當可無罪、否則認爲有犯刑事之嫌、對於楊建平部分、認爲被告所報產價及所得佣金過鉅、與情理不合、如被告不能證明市情有此慣例、則應負相當之罪等語、以後各被告之辯護律師、遂各舉人證·物證·次第爲其當事人辯答、而劉書蕃本人辯述最久、直至晚七時、始告終結、庭定下星期六宣判、劉氏以本人生長福建、說話口音、或有詞不達意之處、恐聽者不盡明白、另錄口述一紙、呈庭加入筆錄、茲將原述文附誌於後、以供公覽、</p>
<p>被告被控頭一點、是用遜記化名挪用儲金欵項、經營公債、猶幸蒙審判長到儲滙局查對被告所舉各種反證、均查明無訛、同時又發現許多對被告有益材料、此外更有王伯羣部長來函、浙江實業銀行之調查、又任嗣達經理之口供、皆可證明遜記與本人無絲毫關係、證物證人皆備、對於此點、書蕃自不必多辯、至於劉劍侯名義之存欵、以王部長來函、及浙江實業銀行之支票存户證之、此十萬兩自屬遜記、實非書蕃之欵、更無疑義、當時王伯羣爲其友人託書蕃保管此欵、不過爲愼重起見、多作一重保障、書蕃卽時將該欵存入分局、且卽將支票簿存欵簿、統交與任嗣達經理收執、因遜記係直接、經自與任接洽、故一切各簿、亦交其掌管、當時並囑其買得公債時、卽拿支票來簽字、不可遭誤還欵、此點請參看四月二十七日任嗣達經理在庭口供、便可證明、此乃私人友情上之委託、王伯羣部長並非用部長地位來命書蕃、書蕃亦非局長地位去命令經理、請看王伯羣部長之信、有云他的朋友自己直接與任經理接洽、任嗣達經理於四月二十七日在庭口供云、在遜記十月二十日未由王部長代其友人交來欵與書蕃之前數天、王部長已與其說過、交欵之後數日、復由王部長用名片介紹其友與任嗣達經理接洽、當時經過情形如此、故書蕃簽發支票、一張六萬兩、一張四萬兩、皆抬頭任嗣達、此皆依委託人之意辦理、書蕃自己並無絲毫關係、書蕃所知者、卽此爲止、至如何接洽、如何收買、如何墊欵、如何付欵、如何算利、此係上海分局部分之事、書蕃皆不與聞、若照辯護本人範圍而論、則以此爲止亦可、惟檢察官第二點、係控短收利息、共三百五十元七角三分、有損國會此點雖不在書蕃範圍之内、爲論事實起見、書蕃對此亦稍有陳述、凡當收之欵而不收、卽謂之損失、不當收之欵而不收、不能爲之損失、有欵墊出、始收利息、守際上無墊欵、自不能收息、當時遜記已於十月二十日存有十萬兩、十一月二十三日、開始購買公債、上海局未將遜記所存之欵、先拿來用、又兼遜記續交之欵有的存在暫記簿、有的存在儲金分户賬、皆未立時劃冲、致墊欵之額及科算利息、皆受影響、譬如墊欵最高額、只八萬餘元、該時遜記、尙有實値二十三萬餘元之公債票、存在局中、那有墊欵至四十餘萬、惟就事守而論、遜記交來欵項、不管銀行方面如何登賬、何如冲賬他總算自己存欵、預備買債劵的、當儘先撥用、再有付欵、始謂之墊欵、至後來遜記續交一元、卽墊欵少一元、若銀行因自己登賬關係、不管顧客曾否先已交欵、都要人一分利錢、顧客前存之欵、給三厘錢、後來所交之欵爲數亦鉅、（約有九萬餘元）都不算利息、商業上是說不過的、顧客那裏肯依如此辦法、對顧客說不過去的、便是不應收的、便不能認有損失、此項經過情形、就賬簿十看來、已極明白、檢察官所謂短收三百五十元七角三分、任嗣達經理所謂長收亦在此點、任經理已有詳細解釋、我的辯護人劉律師、亦有說明、再說到未收手續費一節、遜記確有出手續費、因儲金局是託他之經紀人辦的、該欵卽歸他經紀人取去、儲金局若再收一重手續費、却不是開門不想做生意麽、又保證金一層、從前因分局之事、非書蕃經手所辦、故不能詳知、所以說不淸楚、現刻自隨同法官到分局調查看賬之後、方能明白、此次分局代遜記人收買公債是以現錢買現貨、並非在交易所做投機買賣、儲金局代遜記辦理是銀貨兩交、安得有保證金代遜記經手收買公債、局中己賺有五千九百餘元不能謂之不鉅、照事實而言、書蕃及任嗣達並無犯罪、且無錯誤、營業之事、槪歸分局經理主管、書蕃身當總局長、際此末次開庭審理機會、敢將本末陳述、以明眞相、再看遜記所做押欵、任經理只算抵押品之實値六成、息錢還算二分、對於遜記有無優待、不用分辯、可以自明、所以書蕃於三月八日在偵查庭上有說過對於遜記息錢等等、經手人業已星散、無從細查當時情形、就所得材料而言、任嗣達對於遜記實在太刻、請檢卷便知、</p>

<p>將上列兩表與原審查書之統計表對照審核、該原統計表所載進口數量價値及稅收三欄數目、均不確實、茲依總稅務司來表考察其所列二十年二月至十月一欄、卽係海關按照上述畫分征收舶來菸稅辦法、所收百分之十金單位關稅、又二十年十一月至十二月一欄、卽係海關在是年底所收百分之五十金單位關稅、故知廿年實收舶來捲菸關稅、合東三省計算、共金單位一·四零六·一三四元九三、而原審查書因不明二十年關稅征收手續、遂致誤算、謂二十年紙菸關稅、竟有金單位六·四六四·零八六元、其由此錯誤點而推算二十一年二十二年之關稅數目、亦自然不免錯誤矣、須知舶來紙菸進口逐漸減少、並非始於二十一年施行二級稅時代、卽在十七十八兩年施行七級稅時、已早經逐年減少、試查海關貿易總册及統計年刊、舶來紙菸進口、十七年爲九·五四三·五七四盒、十八年爲八·一三六·三二五盒、十九年爲六·二二三·七三九盒、又依此次總稅務司表二十年爲五·八八四·七八六盒、二十一年爲一·三六二·八四二盒、二十二年爲五零零·六二六盒、可知舶來紙菸進口數量在統稅施行七級三級二級稅各期間、均皆逐年減退、縱然統稅再改級數、要亦不能恢復從前進口數量、可斷言也、總上七點、原呈中所引用之統計旣誤、則所謂洋商之利益、華商之損失、以及政府稅收之損失、根本上皆不能成立、已如上述、又該菸廠等初次來呈認爲稅級待遇不平、主張對於上中菸宜有相等之增加、以示大公、其八十元之一級不動、尙於政府稅收無損、如果計算遞增、確能爲華商獲益、自可考慮更改、乃其提議書中、又主張現行稅制、下菸每箱收稅八十元、應予減少、且認七級稅制爲賦稅平均之原則、是不啻請求减少低級稅率、姑無論該菸廠等所主張、前後宗旨不定、卽以目下政府財政困難、在此國難嚴重、剿匪建設、在在需欵之時、加稅甫經實行、又何能率議輕減、此在事實上難予採擇者也、當捲菸統稅開辦之初、原屬七級稅制、其後經多數廠商以金價日漲、原料價格增高、稅級過密、而售價限制太嚴實於營業妨碍、議請改爲三級稅制、將售價限制放寛、政府以所請有理由、但能增益稅收、自當兼顧商情、始有三級稅制之變更、其後政府需欵、再行提議加稅、而多數華商、復以營業不振、再請將限價放寛、故採納衆議、復改爲二級稅制、上年十二月增加稅率、原以政府需欵至急、不得已之舉、然於稅制一仍其舊、並無變更也、夫稅制固可固時制宜、要以裕課便商爲主、該廠商等此項請求、果爲大多數利益着想、不致牽動原有稅收、自應由大會切實審查、議具方案、呈請將上菸級數酌增、如謂仍以七級稅爲最適宜、則當時廠商、非有切膚利害、何必請求更改救濟、且改級已歷三年餘矣、各廠營業確已較前發展、是該廠商之主張、在從前已因推行窒碍而改變、今復摭拾舊制企圖减稅、未免故步自封、且又非全體菸廠之主張、不過以少數廠商自身營業之不振、卽以爲稅制之不良、援用錯誤之統計、作片面之宣傳、殊足影響正當菸商營業、及政府稅收、不得不根據事實、加以辨正、各菸商中不乏明達之人、深願力謀團結、積極整理業務、勿爲减稅之謠傳所惑、致碍自身之利益、實所厚望、特此說明、</p>

<h3>讀書問答　讀「讀書問答集質疑」（一）</h3>
<p>丨丨一、「爲什麽中國書法必答要隨着社會生活日益繁雜而籌爲一種不重要的技術呢？」</p>
<p>丨丨答未護</p>
<p>在三月二十九日我們發表了一篇「習字無用論一的小文，據我們調查的結果，這篇文字給與大衆的影響要比本欄各項討論都來得廣大。有一個讀者告訴我們，他們的同事六七十人中，平日看「讀書問答」的不過七八人，但這一次，因爲這標題引起了他們的注意，於是每人都看起來，不僅看過而已，他們還互相討論，其中已有幾位朋友已不再臨碑描帖了。這是什麽緣故呢？自然，不是說這篇文字本身有什麽較高的價値，不過這問題與他們的實踐物生活有密切的關係。他們天天都在「練字」，所有的閑暇時間都在臨碑描帖上，現在忽然聽見人家說「習字無用」，不免引爲驚異，不能不停筆考慮：到底這是什麽一回事呢！</p>
<p>我們也收到了許多反對者的意見及懷疑者的質疑，可見這一問題還有討論的價値，朱君這一回提出的問題是想了解中國書法没落的全過程、這雖然是屬於理論的範圍，但對於說服大家不再玩這套「彫蟲小技」是不無裨益的，並且這一討論正是「習字無用論」那一篇短文的補充、在目下正是需要的。</p>
<p>中國人爲什麽對於「書法」有着這樣深厚的信念呢？這不是無緣故的。本來「文字」不過是一種「記言記事」的符號，它的寫法實在没有多大的研究的價値。中國人對於文字的認識超過它本身應有的意義。，是存在於中國文字的構造上。中國文字從一象形」以後，没有直接走上「拼音」的路徑，是非常可惜的。它阻礙了中國文字的進化，一直到現在它只是停留在繪畫直系上。然而，它却賦與了中國文字的藝術性，書法成爲了一種特殊的藝術，文字抬高了聲價，它變成封建時代藝術的一種特型，用作覇糜士人的乎段，瘋狂了幾千年。這一種藝術自然是屬於貴族的，古今的書法大家，每每同時是達官貴人。這種藝術的修養，要有優遊的閑暇，要有明窗凈九的環境，當然不是連字也不識終日忙碌的人可問津的。講到它的藝術價値，除開文字本身的記言記事外，它並無繪畫，音樂，等可以陶冶性情，調理心緒，表現人生情感的作用，它只不過賦有一種形式上的美，並不能寫出人間的悲喜劇。你能在一塊名家的手蹟中，得到人生的認識嗎？那是决不能的。所以卽就藝術性的本身說，這種藝術也有一定的界限的。它並没有繪畫的前途。</p>
<p>所以中國書法的没落與封建勢力的没落並行的進行並不是偶然的。封建勢力的没落，這種覊糜士人的工具也就漸漸失其意義了。中國自進入現代化的階段，社會生活要求的時代的智識比任何時代，任何國家的過去都來的嚴重，這種激變反映在「文字」上，就是中國文字要求脫出那種藝術型，而回到「記言記事」，祗求敏捷的應用，再用不着去崇模古人了。</p>
<p>這種歷史的進程，自中國新教育制度成立以後，我們可以看得明明白白。學校中的習字課程現在祗列在小學校的課程表上了。它的作用完全與以前兩樣。書法家也日益没落了。新學校出身的人，除了一部份文人前輩外，也很少再玩這套「彫蟲小技」了。祇有一部分遺老輩尙在玩弄這「字古董」以度他的殘年，它的命運自然將同前時代的遺老們一同就滅的。（當然它還可保有歷史上的價値。）</p>
<p>就社會生活方面說，現在中國已進入應用打字機的階段了。大的公司已被採用打字機，事務人員的日用上鋼筆，鉛筆漸漸要代替毛筆了。因此，「文字」只求迅速敏捷，並不要求「仿古」脫俗。在商店中，我們已看見一種簡筆字，在各省廣大的商塲在運用；低級鼓詞，唱</p>
<p>本，小說中也久已採用了。這是說明什麽呢？這已預示了中國文字的改造，並且在實生活中已開始了。</p>
<p>中國國音字母，雖然尙未變爲日本的假名那樣的東西，使漢字躍入了一新的階段，但這運動的發生無疑的是中國文字改造意識的開始。國音字母運動失敗了，這失敗是因爲它没有把握改造文字的全意義，它只從國音一部分着手，忽視了「形義」的部份。雖然近年來好像對於文字的改造上是很消沉的，其實不然，如翻譯上，科學上的造新字，一般人簡律字的應用等都是表示了中國文字上的改造。中國文字現在正要求走上「拼音」的路徑去。</p>
<p>這是中國書法没落過程的一點葉描。我想，這對於朱君了解爲什麽中國書法變爲一種不重要的技術一點上約略有些許帮助罷！</p>
<p>最後，我們還得加上一點蛇足。「習字無用論」一向未反對人家爲應用而練習字的。不過，練習字可在有機會拿筆寫東西時，順便注意一點就是了。不必將整個的可寳貴的業餘時間用在這一技術上。不錯，對於文字藝術迷戀的人，在今日社會上仍不是没有，大多數前時代遺下來的我們的父執輩，他們還在替聖人擔憂，恐懼「斯文掃地」，拼命的在教育後生，去精研書法的。你們對於他們的勸言，最好婉言謝之。自己應跟着時代前驅，凖備你們生活上應有的智識和技能。</p>

<p>— 余雪岫</p>
<p>余嘗考其十二經起止，而知其陰陽命名之大略，如所謂陽者，皆在外側，所謂陰者，皆在内側，所謂陽者，多在手足之背，所謂陰者，多在手足之心，手足之小指，外側最外之部也，脈之起止於此而循行乎外側者，謂之太陽，如手小腸太陽之脈，起於小指之端，循手外側，膀胱足太陽之脈，出外踝之後，循京骨，至小指外側，手太陽之筋，起於小指之上，足太陽之筋，起於足小指上，是也，是故太陽云者，猶言最外也，其次則小指次指之間，脈之起止於此而循行乎外側者，謂之少陽，如三焦手少陽之脈，起於小指次指之間，膽足少陽之脈，循足跗上，入小指次指之間，手少陽之筋，起於小指次指之端，足少陽之筋，起於小指次指之上，是也，是故少陽云者，猶言次外也，其又次者，則起止於中指以内，然其筋脈所循之途，仍在外側，謂之陽明，如大腸手陽明之脈，起於大指次指之端··入肘外廉，上臑外前廉，胃足陽明之脈，下循脛外廉，下足跗，入中指内間，手陽明之筋，起於大指次指之端，結於腕上，循臂，上結於肘外，足陽明之筋，起於中三指，結於跗上，邪外上，加於輔骨，上結於膝外廉，手陽明之筋，起於大指次指之端··上結於肘外，足陽明之筋，起於中三指，結於跗上，邪外上，加於輔骨，上結於膝外廉，是也，</p>
<p>大指者，内側之最内者也，脈之起止於此而循行乎内側者，謂之太陰，如肺上太陰之脈，循臂内，上骨下廉，入寸口，上魚，循魚際，出大指之端，脾足太陰之脈，起於大指之端，循指内側，···上内踝前廉，上踹内循脛骨後，··上膝股内前廉，是也，手太陰之筋，起於大指之上，足太陰之筋，起於大指之端内側，是也，其次者，爲大指以内，脈之起止於此而循内側以行者，謂之厥陰，如心主手厥陰之脈，循臑内，行太陰少陰之間，··循中指，出其端，肝足厥陰之脈，起於大指叢毛之際，上循足跗上廉，去内踝一寸，此雖與脾足太陰同起於大指，然脾足太陰循指内側，此則起於叢毛，較之脾脈爲在外，故爲厥陰也，手心主之筋，起於中指，與太陰之筋並行，結於肘内廉，足厥陰之筋，起於大指之上，上結於内踝之前，是也，其又次爲小指，脈之起止於此而其途徑仍循行手内側者，謂之少陰，如心手少陰之脈，入掌内後廉，循小指之内，出其端，腎足少陰之脈，起於小指之下，邪趨足心，出於然谷之下，循内踝之後，手少陰之筋，起於小指之内側，結於銳骨，上結肘内廉足少陰之筋，起於小指之下，並足太陰之筋，邪走内踝之下，結於踵，是也，由此觀之，其行於手足外側之脈，皆謂之陽，以起止於最外者爲太陽，其次爲少陽，其又次爲陽明，其行於手足内側之脈，皆謂之陰，以起止於最内者爲太陰，其次爲厥陰，其又次爲少陰，果以此法命名，則所謂兩陽合明，兩陰交盡之說，又不可解矣，</p>

<h3>關於體温之一般的常識</h3>
<p>— 吳濱濤</p>
<p>吾人身體，普通保持着一定的溫度，便是體溫。檢查體溫所用的溫度表，稱爲體溫計。普通健康人的體溫，是在攝氏體溫計三十六度至三十七度之間；小兒的體溫，約較比稍高，其平均爲三十七度五分：若七十歲以上的老人，其體溫約爲三十六度。以上所言的，都是健康體溫。能保持此一定的健康體溫，在健康未被破壞以先，是永久不會變的。</p>
<p>健康體溫，常因種種原因，而有很微的增减。例如淸晨的時候，體溫略低；而在午後則略高。又若神經的興奮，及飲食之後，均能增高體溫。所以健康體溫，雖不免稍有增减：但其增减之度數，是不超過一度的。倘若發現體溫，逐漸的减低，竟達於三十六度以下時；或發現體溫，逐漸的增高，竟在三十七度以上，均足以證明身體的健康，已被</p>
<p>破壞，而呈病的狀態了。</p>
<p>體溫若是在三十七度以上，稱爲發熱。以發熱的程度，而别爲六種：</p>
<p>亞熱丨丨自三十七度，至三十八度之間。</p>
<p>輕熱丨丨自三十八度，至三十八度四分之間。</p>
<p>中熱丨丨早晨則自三十八度五分，至三十九度；在晚間則更增至三十九度五分。</p>
<p>最高熱丨丨早晨在三十九度五分以上，晚間亦趨超過四十度五分。</p>
<p>臨死熱丨丨體升至四十二度以上，或下降至三十三度以下，往往取死的轉歸。</p>
<p>檢查體溫的時候，先將體溫計，用手緊握而振盪之，使水銀指針，降落。於是挿入腋下，使被檢者，以臂緊夾之。大約十分鐘至十五分鐘，卽可將體溫計取也，而視察體溫計上所指示之體溫度數。倘若腋下有汗腋，則當在先拭乾，自不待言。檢查體溫之部位，雖以在腋下爲最普通；然在必要時，亦可由口腔，股間，肛門，或腋中等部位檢查之</p>
<p>檢查體溫的次數，通常以每日三次爲原則：在早晨七時頃一次，午後三時頃一次，及夜間九時頃一次。若有必要的時候，亦可增减檢查體溫的次數，較爲妥當。</p>
<p>發熱的狀態之不同，卽熱型之不同，有如下列之所示：</p>
<p>一，在早晨與晚間之熱，相差在一度以内的，槪爲稽留熱。如傷寒，肺炎等，均是稽留熱。</p>
<p>二，熱度之早間與晚間，相差在一度以上，二度以内者，卽稱爲弛張熱。如敗血症，膿瘍等，均發弛張熱。</p>
<p>三，在早晨爲平溫，（卽康健體溫，三十七度左右。）但至晚間，則升至三十九度乃至四十度者，謂之消耗熱。肺癆其例之一。</p>
<p>四，假如發熱是隔日而發作的。不發熱之時，其體溫爲常溫，稱爲間歇熱。瘧疾，卽是此種熱型。</p>
<p>五，間歇熱，與稽留熱，相互混雜的熱型，稱爲回歸熱。例如回師熱病。在中國則甚少見的。</p>
<p>關於發熱的專用名詞，亦有種種，述其較普通者：每日中體溫的變化，卽是熱度最高點與最低點的相差，稱爲日差。熱度之逐日增高者，稱爲熱之增進期，熱度增至不能再增時，稱爲熱之極期。如疾病漸漸治愈，或取死的轉歸時，則體溫下降，稱爲熱之解散期。因疾病的痊愈，在一日中，卽將高熱完全退去，恢復健康體溫的，特名曰分利。分利之徐緩者，特稱爲熱之渙散。倘已經分利之發熱，於若干時後，仍再發熱者，稱爲發熱之假性分利。</p>
<p>最通用之體溫計，有攝氏及華氏之二種。本篇所言之體溫，均攝氏。但華氏攝氏二種體溫計之體溫度數，可以互相換算的公式如次。</p>
<p>（一）由華式改爲攝氏</p>
<p>將測得華氏之度數，减去三十二度，然後以五乘之，以九除之，卽得。</p>
<p>（二）由攝氏改爲華氏</p>
<p>將測者攝氏之度數，以九乘之，以五除之，然後再加三十二度，卽得</p>
<p>常用體溫對照表</p>
<p>攝氏　　華氏</p>
<p>３３——９１·4</p>
<p>36——９６·８</p>
<p>３７——９８·６</p>

<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三千）狂犬病</p>
<p>問　什麽呌做狂犬病？</p>
<p>答　狂犬病是因爲被患有這種疾病的動物所咬傷而起的傳染病。</p>
<p>問　患有這種疾病的動物，是不是限於犬類？</p>
<p>答　大多數是犬類；但也有貓，牛，羊，猪等患的。</p>
<p>問　這種病的病原是什麽？</p>
<p>答　病原不明，但病毒沿神經纎維漸達中樞部；所以凡被咬部若近中樞神經，發病愈速。</p>
<p>問　人體被狂犬病的動物咬傷後，是不是立刻發病？</p>
<p>答　不是。一定要經過半個月到一個月</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>的潛伏期後纔發病。</p>
<p>問　發病時的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　發病時可以分做三期。</p>
<p>問　第一期病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　第一期是憂鬱期也呌前驅期，起初在咬傷部覺疼痛和知覺異常；漸次波及到附近部分，淋巴腺腫脹，同時陷於陰鬱狀，對於外界一切，漠不關心，然有時呈不安穏狀，有出外亂走的。體溫稍上昇，這期的持續普通二日到五日。</p>
<p>問　第二期病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　第二期是發揚期也呌恐水期，呼吸期和嚥下期發痙攣，有呼吸不整及喘嗚，嚥下液體的時候或單見了液體的時候，已發痙攣。所以這種病又有恐水病的名稱。有時四肢和軀幹肌誙攣，加之有不安，興奮，和譫語，後來成躁狂。體溫愈上昇，達攝氏表四十度，在死前見過高熱，脈搏頻數不整，呼吸促迫。這期普通一日到三日。</p>
<p>問　第三期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　第三期是麻痺期，各種病狀消失，再矣進飲食，但發生全身肌肉的麻痺，數小時到十餘小時而死。</p>
<p>問　有没有例外病狀？</p>
<p>答　有的。有時開始就現麻痺症狀，這呌做靜狂。大槪以病毒更强的居多數。</p>
<p>問　這種狂犬病危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>答　除非在咬傷後立刻注射預防漿苗，若仍不奏效，槪屬危險。</p>
<p>問　治療狂犬病的方法，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答　應該把咬傷部用燒灼器或發烟硝酸燒灼腐蝕。咬後立刻用巴士德氏法行預防接種。</p>
<p>問　巴士德氏預防接種，是用什麽材料的？</p>
<p>答　是用狂犬的腦脊髓製成毒性不等的漿苗，依次注射，使被咬傷的人自體生出抵抗病毒的物質，以免發病</p>
<p>問　對於發躁的病狀用什麽藥品？</p>
<p>答　用嗎啡或水化醛　内服。</p>
<p>問　預防這病的方法，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答　注意家畜，尤其是犬類的健康狀態。如果發見疑惑的時候，應當把他殺死。</p>
<h3>治療軟性下疳之經騐片談</h3>
<p>— 莊紹宋</p>
<p>下疳分兩種。一稱硬性下疳。一稱軟性下疳。硬性下疳爲傳梅毒性螺旋狀菌之出發點。其凖對之治療爲注射Ｎeosalvarsan或ＳulfoˉTiepaisenano（新六○六或新九一四）大都於一星期前後。下疳能軟化消散而就治。此爲一般醫家所公認。無復異辭。軟性下疳由於ＤncreyˉUnna氏菌之傳染而起。其發病至就治之經過。憑醫藉所載。按以往臨症所見。大都在三四星期乃至五六星期之間。此猶就連續積極治療者而言。若旋治旋輟，治療經過中旋愈旋發者。往往遷延不治。有歷數月者。是以軟性下疳遠較硬性下疳爲難治。醫家視爲畏途。病家每起疑慮。以爲同一下疳。人或一星期而治。波則歷數星期不愈。每歸咎於醫家之治法技術用醫之不當。殊不知下疳有硬性軟性之分。症狀不同。經過不同。治法各異。就治之難易尤大有差别。惟軟性下疳之頑固難治。故其治療方法最値得醫家之研究。而病家之疑慮亦非全無價値者。則以軟性下疳之病狀千變萬化。最易引起醫家之診斷錯誤。且病性險惡。一旦潰决。遺禍亦較硬性下疳爲兇暴。茲略述個人之治療經騐以供參考。</p>
<p>吾人所見軟性下疳之病人。以與硬性下疳較。其比數略爲三與七。軟性下疳較爲少數。軟性下疳之發於男子之陰莖包皮或女子之大小陰唇者。診斷極易一目瞭然。絶不至於錯誤。其發於男子龜頭及尿道外口女子陰核後連合及尿道口近傍者。診斷極易錯誤。因其部組織本爲比較的硬固。稍一忽略。使誤診爲硬性下疳。加以潰痬周圍受炎症之浸潤。其硬并必較平日增加。外觀絶類硬性下疳。更有潰痬部周邊紅腫隆起者。稱隆起性下疳。Ｕlcus　molleelevatum更與硬性下疳無分軒輊。涇谓莫便。復有潰痬部差愈。又轉成硬結者。或潰痬尙未愈。潰痬周邊及底部逐次隆起變硬者是稱混合下疳Ｕlcus　mixta類此錯亂迷離。鑑别最難。尤奇者在男子淋疾患病一二星期之後。於尿道口内側往往發生一種綫小潰痬。周圍並無若何侵潤。初或以爲淋疾分泌之刺戟。或以爲梅毒之襲發。及驅梅療法失敗。轉以應用軟性下疳之治療。果見疾瘳。此類診例。數見不鮮。實爲軟性下疳之變態最著者。凡此難鑑别難確診之軟性下疳。幸賴有最新簡捷之新治療。足供試騐的應用。實爲我治療界之一大快事。蓋此類變症下疳經用驅梅法失敗者。一經採用新療法無不立告痊愈也。</p>
<p>余於十五年前治療軟性下疳。除普通軟膏劑或散布劑外。極嘗用五％硫酸銅軟膏。塗一日夜後創面淸潔。此後換用普通軟膏。可望逐次就治病灶不再擴大。至十年前改用Ｅrinacol膏。用法如硫酸銅軟膏。其刺戟與痛感較弱。效績大佳。私心欣幸。然全治經過。終亦在三句左右。在此長經過中。稍一不愼。便有續發淋巴炎或擴大轉爲侵蝕性之虞。私心竊爲不安。病家時感不滿。近數來除於外用藥外。一律加用新劑Ｄmelcos。此劑爲Ｄucrey氏菌苗。應用爲靜脈注射劑，最小量爲二百萬萬菌。隔三數日注射一次。劑量逐次遞加。就余個人經騐。至多注射二三劑。下疳全治。有注射一次而治者。絶少有注射四五劑者。惟注射後輒有高度寒顫發熱。此視個人體質强弱大有差别。有極輕度者。有注射當晚全夜發熱者。多數病人於注射當日反應發熱時。每深悔注射之孟浪。及一二日後自覺局部症狀銳减。始恍然信服藥效之應騐不爽。自動要求作第二次注射。如同時施用相當之外治法。大都軟性下疳之全經過約在十日左右。或不及旬日。鮮有達二旬者。故凡變症下疳或用驅梅療法無效時Dmelcos之注射最爲需要。其效能確實縮短軟性下疳之治愈期。並節减各種危險合併症如横痃（卽淋巴炎）等。</p>
<h3>關於「民生」喜美靈小言</h3>
<p>— 戴行鋼</p>
<p>杭州民生製造廠，艱苦締造，規模大備，近發明痛風特效藥「喜美靈」，（Ｓimalin）由國藥防已中抽出有效成分，製爲鹽酸鹽，費二載之光陰，耗鉅額之金錢，及無數之動物生命，始獲告成，其製劑有注射液及藥片，與日貨喜那美仁同功，在發行之先，除動物試騐外，並先經該廠男女職員之躬親實試，以觀其有無反應，此種犧牲精神，洵不可及，更請各大醫師臨疹實騐，曾經改良八次，而不佞對於該廠之致力發明，尤所親見親聞，試用而囑其改良者，亦三數次，凡曾用者，感譽其效力靈確也，比聞有人竊議，疑爲來自扶桑，改頭換面，嗟夫，是何言首？雖不敢謂中國之大，必無此類　詐之徒，詭譎之謀，但以該廠之令望卓著，深信其决不若是之喪心病狂，自害害國，矧又不佞之所知之有素者耶？就事實論，果欲販貨改裝，則早可推銷，奚待今日，果係他國成貨，則一帆風順，早利發行，何至年來醫師實騐錄中，至今尙有局部微疼之一頁報告也。（日貨向無疼痛，惟有時不免潮紅發疹，而該廠之喜美靈，在過去實騐中，不發疹，鮮潮紅，惟皮下注射，易感疼痛，肌肉注射則否，）聞該廠仍抱埋頭苦幹之夙志，繼續努力，自標信譽，薏苡何嫌，今則關於局部微痛一節，經藥理的及生理的改進，已獲適當之解决，今後出品，不致再有疼痛，據該廠經理周師洛君見告，深盼醫界同志，隨時試用，報告成績，以資參證云，不佞非好爲該廠宣傳，實以良心驅使而發爲此文，維護國產良藥，當亦有心人所共願，嗚呼，人間何世，誦苞桑之詩，吾於中國製藥廠之堅苦奮鬭如「民生」者。抱莫大之希望也。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（六）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第四章　　　肺結核之演進</p>
<p>照上面二章的說法，結核菌一方面由吸入的傳染而入人體，另一方面，又由種種不册的誘因，而助長他的侵襲；那末，是不是肺結核症，從此說完全成功了嗎？這句話應該分開來答覆的。不錯，在這個時候，結核菌確實係在肺部裏作怪的，並且會發生局部病灶的。但此種病灶大半係隨卽愈好，不致蔓延成病，外面也不發生任何症象的。被侵襲的本人，固然是絲毫不覺得，就是醫家用種種精密的診斷方法，也是不能證明的。這一種變化，就是尋常所稱謂的「最初傳染」了。他在臨床上雖没有什麽證明，但在屍體解剖方面的證據，是很誜分的；據這方面的統計，是佔人類總數三分之二以上，在貧苦階級方面，每百個屍體中，差不多有九十七以上的數目，係現着局部病灶痕跡的。根據這一種事實，我們可以曉得，在人們的生活過程中，幾乎是個個都有一次受着結核菌的侵襲，而發生局部病灶的。德國大病理學家Ａschof氏說得好；‘世界上的人類，無論是那一個，在他幼年的時代，總患過一次肺結核症的。這一種議論，當然是驚心動目的，但如果讀者們已明瞭「最初傳染」之眞相時，那末，也可以曉得這是必然的事實了。</p>
<p>此種「最初傳染」，事守上並不是僅限於肺部的。有因食物而構成的，前面所說過的小孩因飲牛乳而患腸結核，就是一個好例。尋常無人不知的頸部淋巴結核（俗稱瘰癧），大半係婦女小孩患着的，他也可以由鼻喉的途徑，經過扁桃腺而入的；（作者附註：這一種送徑還没有成爲定論，持異議者尙夥。）頸部頭部的濕症，也可以被侵製的。皮膚結核中的狼瘡，他是以鼻部及其周圍爲大本營的，他的侵襲之原來，是和用指甲爬鼻孔很有關係的。這幾個明顯的例子，無疑地是軼出肺結核本病範圍以外了，但我想也是大家應該曉得的，希望勿等閒視之纔好。</p>

<p>小黑炭管幼良、任職電汽公司、善於長跑、係中華運動會會員、此次參加三千公尺賽跑、繞塲十圈、前五圈爲周如泉劉學銘等前導、黑炭落後二十公尺、至第七圈後如快馬加鞭、不慌不忙、往前直衝、卒以十分二十八秒六獲第一、管君長力甚好、姿勢亦佳、倘努力練習、實一萬公尺賽跑之良將也、</p>
<p>一千五百公尺、劉學銘本大有第一希望、以先參加三千公尺、氣力不支、致獲第三、而潘公寳·周芷本參加三千公尺、且在預賽時均獲第一、昨特放棄三千公尺、專力於一千公尺、奪得首、一名、此亦受時間之限制、否則三千公尺中競爭必更劇烈矣、</p>
<p>二級跳遠第一名嚴毅、成績十二公尺○一五、破上屆十一公尺六八之紀錄、第　名郭達元成績十二公尺、與第一名相差微幾、郭君兩脚彈力實較嚴毅爲上惜跳時不得其法、不能盡力爲之、倘稍加訓練、必有驚人成績、第四名胡銀基平時成績甚好、昨以未穿釘鞋、吃虧不少、</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>（八）松松就是普通的松樹，並無其他花式，它的實所限，不能隨意點綴，便祇是一抺的純綠色了。</p>
<p>這樣看起來，讀者就可以知道光是紥繡這幾幅黄緞，上的花式的工程，已是何等的艱難精細，我先前估計它的價値約在六七千兩銀子左右、眞可說是最少限度的代價了！然而這還祇是用以表裹那鸞輿底内部的一種點綴品，也許太后竟從不曾注意過呢！但是論實在情形，太后在這些繡件上面，除掉原料之外，確也不曾化過多少銀子；因爲織繡的工人都是長期留養在宮禁内的，他們對於工資，是决不計較的。就是工作時間的久暫，他們也得悉聽懿旨，自己是絶對不知道的：也許一件工作做一兩個月就完了，也許做三四年還不能完，也許這個人已做做得精疲力竭，連眼睛也瞎了，而他的工作却還不曾完成，這樣就得另外派人繼續做去，務必使這件工作做到圓滿爲止。</p>
<p>這鸞輿的本身是用籐製的，製工當唏是特别的精巧耐用。輿的兩旁，在半腰裏，各有一根木棍拴着：這兩根本棍都是用最堅實的木料做的，中部渾圓，兩端略扁。而在前後兩端上，又各有一根横木連繫着。縱横四根木棍，怡巧架成了一個長方形，鸞輿就夾在這長方形的中間。抬的時候，有八個轎夫分佔着這長方形的四角。（四四)</p>
<h3>戀愛哲學</h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>中學同學某君、年輕貌甚美，服飾亦殊摩登。最近他要求我發表些我的戀愛哲學，我知道有一位女郎垂靑於他，他今已纏綿於戀愛的瀭牀中而不能自拔了。</p>
<p>戀愛，本無所謂哲學或科學的區别，硬要把戀愛列入哲學學程中，年輕人誠未免好事，但以另一方面說，年輕人居然認戀愛亦成哲學，把戀愛看作高尙深邃的學程以學習着，是則他們的樸素純正的心是可愛的。</p>
<p>我頗信仰易卜生，同學總該知道我的。我如今應用易卜生「全或無」的套調，發表我的戀愛哲學吧：「非標凖美人則毋寗無愛人！」</p>
<p>提到標凖美人，問題就接着發生了。美人該立何種標凖？私人妄擬的標凖抑是大衆公認的？「情人眼裏出相施，」大衆公認不合標凖的而你又武斷伊在標凖以上，那我問你愛伊不愛呢？</p>
<p>所幸我們已留出退步的餘地，我們是討論着哲學呢，哲學是有主觀性的，主觀性是構成哲學的要素，你是對手，果爲標凖美人否？你儘可憑一己的主觀而加以判定的。換句話說，你認爲伊是標凖美人，那你與之戀愛可也。再換句話補說，你要和伊戀愛，可不必問我的。</p>
<p>若干朋友要我發表戀愛哲學，我今謹借春秋一角以了心願。</p>
<h3>瘧疾</h3>
<p>— 鄭楚堯</p>
<p>一般飄泊在異鄉的流浪者，往往會很輕易地和病做着親密的朋友；譬如我自己，因爲生活的鞭撻，這次，被鞭到這山鄉地方來，每天，人是不多見的，祇是許多綠葉的樹木，不時觸進眼簾；照理，像在這好空氣的地方住着，於身體是能增加健康的？但，巧得很，我竟爲在這好地方染着極討厭的瘧疾，本來這病祇要吞幾粒對症的金鷄納霜丸，是會立刻見效的，可是這山鄉地方是買不到的，没法，祗能試依着鄉人土法，『姑妄爲之』地做了一下，那方法是這樣的：</p>
<p>當要發瘧疾的那天，淸晨起來，空腹喫完一塊昨夜預備好的，有刀刻着一道據說是驅瘧符的豆腐乾，便一個兒不給任何人看見地跑到街上相近的地方，遇到一口井或一條河，便從袋裏摸出也是昨夜預備好的紅紙包丨包裏裝有七米七茶和一個制錢，放在井口上或是河畔，同時便向着紅紙包念道『先生！你該在這兒等我一等，我去買杯茶來給你喝，</p>
<p>』說完，便要頭也不回地從另一條街跑回到自己住的地方；據說這樣瘧疾便完</p>
<p>全好了。</p>
<p>我是曾經這般試過一下的，可是當我從别一條街跑回來時，那討厭的病便立刻發足了！在床上，我反問告訴我那方法的鄉人，我說：『爲什麽這方法會這般不靈啊！』</p>
<p>『先生·這是你太不誠心的緣故啦！』</p>
<p>這是他給我的回答。</p>

<p>『我們的小姐是怎樣的厲害！我們的姨太太是怎樣的浪漫！我們的太太是阿彌陀佛！』···『伊們打麻將不在乎，給我們的工錢，却窮兇極惡！還有三元的！三元半的，老實說：太太，小姐們，自己精明，買小菜也親自出馬丨我們旣揩不到一文錢！工資非漲到每月七元，八元不可。』『夢想吧！伊們肯化錢的，不過是小姐姨太太們，偷人倒貼罷了！』這是娘姨，大姐們，蟻聚在老虎竈上的播音！</p>

<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>摩登婦女的美容法</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>（一）額的增美法。額爲頭面最重要的部分，關係面相的好壞。我們中國人的額形，大槪可分爲圓形，方形，尖形，Ｕ字形，Ｍ字形等五種，依照各種形狀如何，把頭髮遮蓋額面，裝飾的樣子，也不相同的。假使爲狹額的面，應把在生髮的部分，適宜的剃去額的左右兩端的髮，塗上淡溥的雪花膏，同時把梳髮的式樣，與額面打扮得相稱。大槪狹額的婦女，梳裝頭髮，應梳四分式或六分式，如梳六分式的髮，把髮六分向右分開，第一個魏夫（Ｗave卽用髮鏝Ｉron）把髮燙成波狀形）一直挽上，第二個魏夫，稍下覆在額前，第三個魏夫垂在額邊。梳四分式的頭髮，（把髮四分向右分開）可把額前的髮，完全勾上，祗垂下一個魏夫（波形）的髮假使額角不雅觀，那可裝飾稀薄的加爾式（Ｃurl）丨丨意卽捲上垂下的髮，如額闊的人，那就容易裝飾了，因爲現代的美容，最適應額廣的面，不過額面太闊，其左右兩端的角，必過於顯露，應梳平分式的髮，就是把髮在頭頂的中央左右分開，兩端的額解，用魏夫（波表的髮）格须兩面，那就很美觀了。</p>
<p>（二）頰的美顏法無論男女，一到了中年，兩頰要漸漸瘦削。婦妇兩頰瘦削，就要减少風韻的，所以頰的化裝，不呆不注意的。（一）豐頰的化裝法，先擦以淸潔膏（Ｃoldˉrtam（這膏能去顏面的油性，或上等肥皂亦可，頰的瘦削部分，用指頭輕輕捺二三十下，再用掌心撫摩二三十次，那兩頰外面就發熱，每天早晨，用牙刷蘸食鹽少許，刷齒齦與頰的内側，那末，就慢慢的會豐肥起來的。化裝兩頰時，現在都用頰紅（非胭脂）因爲頰紅的魔力，能使外觀有膨脹兩頰，至於人爲的豐頰法，普通在口内含綿花，其法用圍碁子樣大的藥水棉花一粒，先浸過水，用舌尖嵌在頰的裏面，但是這棉花，每天須更換三四回，因爲久含在口内，要發生臭氣的，最近西洋婦女因含棉很不便利，改用豐頰器了，就是把這器裝在齒齦上的。（二）頰骨高的化裝法，大凡頰骨隆起的婦女，很不雅觀，欲掩飾這缺點，全在乎用頰紅，就是頰骨凸出部分與耳朶相距的中心點，抹上矩形的頰紅，但是斜形部分要濃，漸漸向左右淡暈，那就可以使高的部分不觸目了。</p>
<p>（三）顎的化裝法（一）凹顎的面，倘若修飾得適宜，也能够發揮他的特長，按照化裝的原理而說，有先「照顎形而着紅的方法，」扁額的人，在嘴唇下面凹進的部分，應當飾以像暈的樣子，過於紅就不好看了。頰紅須淡，上下眼臉要顯（用眼臉膏）假使自己忖量兩頰瘦削，再</p>
<p>加顎形扁凹，最好每天晚上，用指頭搓摩兩頰，那就可以漸漸豐滿的。（二）顎形高闊的婦女，應在接近領的部分，抹上雪花膏，再用頰紅，漸漸從顎尖向下，淡抹成暈，就是從頰下到耳邊，逐漸由濃而淡的抹暈法，那末在對方看起來，就像一張欄圓的面孔了。（三）長顎的化裝法，細長的面，其顎必長，倘若鼻高，還可以勉强掩飾，長顎的化裝，第一重在顎尖，抹上頰紅，用指頭向口邊漸漸抹暈，頰上比較的要圓，且要大紅，那末稍可遮蓋顎長的缺點了。</p>
<p>（四）無顎的化裝法這是面容最大的缺點，應先抹上雪花膏，再在顎下部分，用眼臉膏（塗在眼臉陰影的膏，有黑，綠，茶，灰色等數種，這是西洋婦女晚間的化裝）塗上少許，顯出有陰影的樣子，那看起來，好像有顎了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十九回回柬足傷心自標獨活聽　同歃血共誓精忠</p>
<p>積之道：不問死心不死心，嫂嫂說到作媒這一層的話，我是心領敬謝。甘太太將筷子頭點着他道：也未免太傻了。難道人家做了太太了，你還老守着他不成？積之紅了臉道：嫂嫂說的話，我有些不明白。可是我能下句斷言，這世界上也没有什麽人有這種權威，可以讓我這樣死心蹋地的。甘太太笑道：你别忙呀。現在你是没有見着那個人，你若是見着了那個人，你就知道世上有那種人可以讓你死心蹋地的了。說起這個人，你就知道世上有那種人可以讓你死心蹋地的了。說起這個人，也是一層緣分，有一次我由城裏到海甸來，和他同坐着長途汽車，就談起來了。讓他說，也是到海甸來看一位什麽女朋友的，我倒没有打聽那女朋友是誰。不過問起他家底來，才知道他和我二妹妹婆家是親戚，年底到二妹家去，洽好又和他碰到一處，我二妹當了他的面和我說，要我替他作媒，分明他是没有結婚的了，那時我想着了你。積之搖搖頭道：這話不然。人家旣是個女學生，大槪不怕人當面提親，也很文明。文明女子，憑着有人作媒，就能够成功的嗎？甘太太道：那是自然，先得介紹你兩個人作朋友。不過我想着，他决看得中你。若說他呢，反正比海甸街上的人漂亮些，你也應該看得起，所以在這兩下裏一凑合的中間，這事必然有成。積之也没有作聲，只管扶筷子吃飯。把飯吃完了，厚之走開了，甘太太又低聲笑道：剛才對了你哥哥，你有些不便說，現在可以對我說實話了。你覺得我這個提議怎樣？假使同意的話，我就給你介紹。（三九四）</p>

<h3>談補習</h3>
<p>— 尊慧</p>
<p>「危機」！「危機」！許多人這麽喊過了。夫「危機」者，「危機之機括」也！是安排給靑年走進去的。</p>
<p>在近代歐洲各國，教育的方針有些改變過夾了。怎麽改變的，這道理暫不公開吧，教育當局應該心知其故，但看目前中國教育制度，可知還說不上方針之類；拾了西洋人一點點皮毛，在這兒哄哄後生小子的。（嗚呼！此學生之所以大家要出洋也！）</p>
<p>但眼前一事，殊堪痛恨！天氣熱了，學校放暑假。假期正値天暑，原來是不好讀書的，然而到處添設起暑期學校來，名之曰補習學校！</p>
<p>旣謂之曰補習，卽以醫藥爲例吧，中國人是相信「滋補」的。旣到需要滋補的地步，身體大槪就不甚健康了。女媧昔日補天，正因「天傾西北，地陷東南」。此其一。</p>

<p>和尙道士間通行，算是例外，也許因爲貧窮吧。此其二。</p>
<p>講到研究學問，培植人才，便没有滋補和補綴的道理了。無故終年吃補藥，以求有益身體，荒唐得可觀。這是以學問當有益的補品說。如學問不過是破爛帆布之類，想集攏起來，多一片算一片，這學問更不用說了，不成爲教育的。</p>
<p>不知爲什麽，我們現代遇事想速成，只想剛一下種子，便可採果實，學生於是拚命想縮短年限，以十年的學問於十天造成。彼教員者，嗟！彼不過想在熱天也添一筆進欵而已。於是補習學校有人辦，更有人進去。</p>
<p>將一切寒暑假補習學校廢除，學生的學問程度决不會減低；反之，大可以藉幾個月休息的時光，接觸社會，回到民間，認識生活，使生命得到更自由的發展：專就體力說吧，比埋頭伏案的益處要多的。</p>
<h3>殺人致有</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>雲南和緬甸交界的山中，有一種卡瓦人，據說是，在每年種稻的時候，他們便伏於叢草或樹林中，伺一外鄉客人過路，就突然跳了出來，把他一刀刴死，將其頭顱熱血，祭灑穀地，則是年必獲豐收。</p>
<p>又，上緬甸與印度亞桑省山間的拉加人（Ｎaga），聽說，也有類此的行爲，不過殺的目的，却是用來妨疫治病者。而殺的情形，亦大不相同：先將被擄的或購來的遠地人，養在酋目家中，約個把月光景，然後選擇好日子，用繩索栓着他的頸項，像牛馬一樣地，牽往村中遊行，每家人户，都給以</p>
<p>酒肉，使之醉飽，入夜才由巫師作法殺之。其骨及肉，由各家分去保存，惟頭顱則歸酋目，如是則不怕瘟神和魔鬼了。（按仰光大學内卽藏有此種頭顱，係征拉加人時所獲者）</p>
<p>由文明人看來，這種殺人致用的愚蠢行爲，自是很殘酷的，野蠻的，然而爲了開拓地盤，建立國基，擴充勢力等等事業，文明人又何嘗不像野蠻人一樣，仍然要用頭顱和熱血來祭洒呢？而且需要之多，殺戮之慘，更非野蠻人所能夢想，</p>
<p>不像野蠻人只要一個，僅殺幾刀就够了的。大約就因爲文明人利用的方法，比較聰明此，殺戳的器械，比較精良些，並能必然生效之故，所以誰也不能謂之野蠻吧。</p>
<p>倘若前次洋鬼子的歐洲大戰，不用保全正義伸張公理等等金字招牌來號召，而只表白於衆曰：「這不過我們少數人在互爭市塲，須要人血來祭洒罷了！」那末，我相信頭顱熱血之被利用，絶不至如是之多的。總之，所謂文明人者，僅在善於竊用好名詞以自掩飾而已，此在殺人致用一端上可以見之。</p>
<h3>宇宙與蒼蠅</h3>
<p>— 迫迂</p>
<p>用一只顯微鏡整天在實騐室中瞧着的人，是將蒼蠅當做蒼蠅；用一只望遠鏡整天望着天邊的星斗的人，那是將宇宙當做蒼蠅；負着一個極微的使命，當心地要完成它，那是將蒼蠅當做蒼蠅；計劃着整個的策略，精細地在推動，那是將宇宙當做蒼蠅·</p>
<p>知然科學的實騐與社會科學的實踐都是一樣的！</p>
<p>爲茶壺蓋在水汽上震動了一下，蒸汽機由此發明：這是在蒼蠅的頭上建起了宇宙！蒸汽機發明後，别的且不說，交通方面的應用，是將地域上的「宇宙」縮小爲「蒼蠅」了；一二星期的路程，只變做十個來小時的距離。</p>
<p>蘋果的落地，算得了什麽？我們喝酒的喝酒，打牌的打牌，對於這種蒼蠅般的事件，誰去理它？但是那位糊塗的牛頓將此當做了「宇宙」，於是「地心吸力說」由此產生。</p>
<p>宇宙是包含着蒼蠅，蒼蠅是關聯着宇宙，宇宙雖大，無蒼蠅之微，不成宇宙；蒼蠅雖小，亦萬難漏出宇宙；一切「存在」，是宇宙與蒼蠅的關係；一切「學問，」是「宇宙」與「蒼蠅」間的理解。</p>
<p>近代物理學上的學說，無論是原子論，或者是波力說，都是非常精切地闡明那宇宙與蒼蠅之關係；心理學上無論是行爲論或者完形論，也不出從整個人體看到微小的行爲，從微小的生理了解其整個的行爲；或者是從整個的情境來了解心理的動向的。　　以一個人爲單位來說，則一人之精力，所能努力的只是得蒼蠅般一點結果而已。而這蒼蠅般一點結果，常常會影響到文化，而這些影響，會使我們感到有宇宙一樣的龐大。</p>
<p>許多病菌的發現者，他們的工作那才眞是微小，然而影響於醫學是可驚的。</p>
<p>庸俗的人們，他們自大着。他們看輕蒼蠅般的工作，他們同時也不選他們自認爲宇宙般的工作去做，他們的態度也並不是以别人的工作是錯，而只是認爲别人「做」是錯。似乎，只有「說别人一切工作是蒼蠅」這個工作才是宇宙似的。</p>
<p>中國有這種人，而且這種人特别多。記得以前舊教育下的孩子們，有許多好的發展的自然的衝動。遊玩以及活潑的笑容，是這樣被老年人摧殘的。老年人因爲自己玩不動了，笑容没有了，於是他們妬嫉别人，呌小孩們也動都不動，動一動就說是犯什麽錯誤呀！他們就背熟這些錯誤的規條，而這規條是欽定一般的，聽起來當然是有理了。這是因爲老人家已有老婆孫子，有固定的世界。但是小孩的衝動也就常因此而被摧殘，不久也跟着他的老子走入那固定世界去傳子傳孫了</p>
<p>田園是共同的。你不愛桑樹，以爲桑樹不能吃，那末你來種稻；但中國人是這樣的，他没有稻秧，也不想種。種是苦事，他頂明白；他站在旁邊乘凉，桑抽芽摧殘桑，麥長大則摧殘麥。對摧殘桑，他說，什麽地方有命令，桑是有毒的，我是遵命；對</p>
<p>摧殘麥，、他說、什麽什麽科學家的著作說過，麥是不能吃的，我是他的信徒，最好大家靜坐，彼此默默，則豈非同是人類，無分蒼蠅宇宙乎？無分蒼蠅宇宙，則你是宇宙，我也宇宙。現在忽然甲在種麥，乙在種桑，雖是蒼蠅小事，似乎與己一比，又有宇宙與蒼蠅之分。於是說：「你們現在，蒼蠅蒼蠅，全盤蒼蠅！」</p>
<p>用這個阿Ｑ的公式，於是他自己就成了宇宙，更可以高枕乘凉無疑。（一九三四，五，一○，北平</p>
<h3>娜位出走問題</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>娜拉以女英雄的姿態出現於五四時代。李超女士死得適逢其會，在易卜生主義倡導者胡適博士的筆底，儼然是反抗封建勢力的戰士。</p>
<p>現在，易卜生漸漸從一般人的記憶上消逝，「李超傅」也從國語文教本中踢也；娜拉擁護者相率回到郝爾茂手裏，研究一九三四式時裝，立體派木器，以及跳舞姿態等等，做一個盡善盡美的傀儡。這本也難怪：新靑年，新潮，星期評論陣裏的戰將，北面稽首向封建舊敵投降，忠心替孔家店做衛士；摩登女郎以傀儡自安，亦情理之常。</p>
<p>娜拉的偉大處，她發覺了自己處在傀儡地位，大徹大悟，離開家庭，要去看看「究竟是我錯，還是世界錯。」至於出走以後究竟怎樣，當時大家似乎不甚關心。娜位劇尾上所提出「奇事中的奇事」，易卜生自己已在海上夫人予以解答，似乎也不必大家再操心。首先關心娜拉出走以後種切的：（或是因爲没有路走，終於墮落，或是終於回來。）自魯迅先生始。他在北京女子師範大學講演「娜拉走後怎樣」，提出一個根本的意見，「娜拉旣然醒了，是很不容易回到夢境的，因此只得走；可是走了以後，有時却也免不掉墮落或回來。否則，就得問，她除了覺醒珠心以外，還帶了什麽去。她還須更富有，提包裏有凖備，直白的說，就是要有錢。夢是好的；否則，錢是要緊的。」他還暗示「要求經濟權固然是很平凡的事，也許比要求參政權更要用劇烈的戰鬥。」這篇講演稿，刊載於婦女雜誌，在當時可也不曾引起深切的注意，熱烈的討論。</p>
<p>婦女運動的呼聲和新文化運動一同消沉下去，民國日報的婦女週刊，北京京報的婦女週報先後停刊，新女性也不能支撑下去，婦女雜誌重復回復到雜蛋糕研究上去；男士們厭倦了，女士們更對於冒險英雄事業，不感到興趣了。婦女運動的成績僅有男女同學和女子剪髮二件事，還且女士必得住在什麽宮，短短的頭髮必得燙得蓬髮飛亂。</p>
<p>然而婦女問題的實際，並不以婦女運動之消沈而减其嚴重性。當國民革命北伐中，許多女同志參與革命工作；國民政府成立以後，大小機關也有女同志擔任職務；民法也依據黨的總綱賦予女子以遺產繼承權。這樣，婦女獲得經濟權，彷彿進行得很順利。時隔不久，女同志卸下武裝，到深閨去享福，固不待言。各機關的女職員變成了花瓶，女子爭遺產雖平時見之報載，最多的還是以誘奸未滿什麽年齡的罪名訴求瞻養費；所謂婦女職業，除女招待舞女之類不計外，多少女店員仍依靠她們的脂粉來過高度享樂生活，無論以什麽方式演出，仍是以傀儡始，以傀儡終，絲毫没有變更。</p>
<p>最近娜拉出走問題，突然引起熱烈的討論。自鋗冰在「國聞週報」十一卷十一期提出「娜拉走後究竟怎樣」的問題，連接於十三十四十五十六十八各期都有參加辯論的文章，他處也見參加討論的正反面文章。沈譯倍倍爾名著婦人與社會，重新有人提及有人介紹。原來「娜拉旣然醒了，是很不容易回到夢境的。」怎樣纔脫去傳統的鎖練，做一個堂堂的女人（非傀儡）？畢竟有人念茲在茲的。</p>
<p>於十年之後，回復到十年前的舊問題，其觀點難道一點没有差别嗎？不，十年前的娜拉，以女英雄的姿態出現於我們面前；現在大家心目中的娜拉，己如于立忱所說：「我們理想中的娜拉，應是一個普通的女子，具有一般女子所有的性情與氣質，她有一般女子所有的優點，也有一般女子所有的缺點；覺悟的時機到來，她先人覺悟了，却不是由於她是奇人，正是因爲她具有普通人應有的各面。（見娜拉脫離家庭的原因與走後怎樣的問題）因此，娜拉出走以後的種切，並不能依靠一斗或一擔的同情來支持；所需要的還是魯迅所提出的問題：「夢是好的，否則，錢是要緊的。」丨究竟如何爭取經濟權？</p>
<h3>跳梯（一）</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>有一次深冬的時候，太陽無力地擁抱了餐霞村。村底東邊那靠臨水亭右面的小屋子裏，很多女人在一個垂死的病人的床邊走動着。小院子那滿牆的灰黄的陽光，跟屋子裏的女人們底爲着希望而緊張的心情一樣，慢慢地消逝在暗淡的黄昏裏。</p>
<p>長長的頭髮散披在枕上，面孔像白蠟一樣的病人，動着乾枯了的嘴唇在說話：</p>
<p>「阿梅·······來······」</p>
<p>女人們敏捷地把一個給身上的重棉花壓得呆笨了的小女孩拉近病人身傍。大家在一個失望的沉默裏板着臉像等待着什麽。</p>
<p>「阿梅！不要像你媽那，那末早就死，你要看公平的世界底到來，一定的，天不會虧負窮人的呀···」她動着竹竿樣瘦削的手，顫抖抖地摸着女兒那給北風吹了的臉蛋。</p>
<p>「阿梅底媽死了，她父親铪歛住了哀愁的臉，抱住了她對他底親妹說：</p>
<p>「四妹，你好好地照顧她呀，我有錢送你三塊，或者多點兒五塊一個月，有錢人雖然難爲窮人，可是，窮人爲什麽要對不起他們自己底孩子呢！」</p>
<p>阿梅底四姑，没有兒女，丈夫到市塲去了，她就帶住阿梅從東餐霞村沿着柳拂河走過西餐霞村玩去，春天來了，阿梅也海潑肥胖起來。</p>
<p>「這是一株一株的柳樹，孩子，那邊過去，有一個大的菓圜呢；唔，你底母親就是在這圜子裏剪草，這樣地把兩條生命弄糟了，不然的話，你已經有一個小弟弟了！」姑母攢差潤濕的眼睛，下巴伏在小孩底頭上。</p>
<p>春風輕輕地吹着，把柳樹的柔壓低了，溫柔地指掃着駛過的小船。小孩底閃黑的圓圓的眼睛，望着碧藍色的天究，頭倚在姑母底手臂上，沉靜而舒適地展望着她底幼稚的腦筋裏幻想着的世界。</p>
<p>「姑母，圜裏有很多菓子麽？都給阿梅吃麽？」</p>
<p>這樣地一年過去，冬天重到這村裏來了。一天，姑母跟了她底兄弟，抱着阿梅到村南的一家富户底敞大的客堂裏站着，父親把女兒放下，只穿上了一套陳舊的絨褲褂的身子直挺挺地站着，顫抖抖的手拿住了五十塊洋錢，口裏笨拙到一句話也說不出來。</p>
<p>孩子𥈮着眼睛，死力扯住了姑母底袖子。</p>
<p>「呵呵，孩子，黄大奶這裏有很多東西給你吃，很多漂亮的衣服給你穿呢。我明天來看你呀。」</p>
<p>臨走的時候，父親擰轉身念步向門外出去；姑母偷偷地用淚眼吻了阿梅底頭髮。</p>
<p>黄大奶把孩子拉近自己的身邊來，溫順地撫摸着她底黄弱的頭髮，甜蜜地對她說：</p>
<p>「不要害怕呵，我不打小孩的呢，我明天帶你去看看禾田，那兒有很多長着穀的稻稈哩，也帶你去菓圜看，呀，紅的菓子也有，綠的也有···」女人像雀鳥唱着動聽的歌兒樣說着，努力把孩子氏全付注意力吸引過來，「你是我底孩子一樣，你要聽我底話，没人敢欺負你的呢」。</p>
<p>小孩子底眼框裏的淚水，很快便蒸發乾了。面前擺着許多好吃的東西。還有幾個孩子來跟她玩耍，她快活地過着日子。早上，黄大爺還從茶樓裏帶些點心回來給她。</p>

<h3>本季之對外貿易與日貨</h3>
<p>— 迪庵</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>據海關報告的統計，本年第一季中國對外貿易，在輸出入上，比去年更見衰落，而與前年相比，其衰落程度，尤堪驚人。對外貿易上這種一瀉千里的减退，不消說的表現着中國經濟恐慌的嚴重性；而在整個國民經濟日趨崩潰的情形之下，貿易上的推進，暫時没有任何可以樂觀的因子存在着，反而像賣血的人一樣，在被一次一次的輸完了血之後，或就將在眼花潦亂的眩暈中倒斃在路傍而任人踐踏。</p>
<p>拿數字來看，今年第一季的輸入爲二八九·八一四千元，比去年同期减九六·九六○千元，卽减百分之二六强，比前年同期减一二二·八四六千元，卽減百分之三○弱。本季的輸出爲一二九·○五七千元，比去年同期亦减二八·六二五，卽减百分之一八强，似不如輸入之激減，然比之前年同期，則减九二·九三七千元，卽爲百分之四二的减退，幾至半倍，謂非激减不可。列表如下：（單位千元）</p>
<p>輸　　入　　　　輸　　出　　　　總額　　　　　　入超額</p>
<p>今年第一季　二八九、八一四　一二九、○五七　四一八、八七一　一六○、七五七</p>
<p>去年同期　　三六六、七七四　一五七、六八二　五二四、四五八　二○九、○九二</p>
<p>前年同期　　四一一、六六○　二二一、九九四　六三三、六五四　一八九、六六○</p>
<p>在輸出入總額上，較去年同期减一○五·五八五千元，在百分比上减百分之二○强，較前年同期减二一四·七八三千元，約减百分之三四。整個入超額爲一六○·七五七千元，比去年同期减四八·三三五千元，較前年同期减二八·九○九千元。但入超額之减少，非由於輸出之增多，而是由於輸入額之激减，故除表示購買力之激劇低落外，初無改善可言也。</p>
<p>就英美日三國而言，則美國在輸出入上皆有顯著的增加，共輸入從去年同期之百分之二一點六升至百分之三一點六八，輸出從去年同期之百分之一七點一七增至百分之二二點八三，故在輸出入上占第一位，英國在輸入上，從去年同期之百分之一○點五八降至百分之一○點四二，而輸出則從百分之五點二增至六點六七，占輸入第二位；日本在輸入方面從去年同期之百分之一○點一减至百分之九點三二，在輸出方面亦從去年同期之百分之一六點六五降至百分之一四點一七，占第三位。（單位千元）</p>
<p>輸入　　本季　　　　百分率　　　去年　　　　　百分率</p>
<p>美國　九一、九四七　三一·六八　七九、三○八　二一·六○</p>
<p>英國　三○、二四三　一○·四二　三八、八一八　一○·五八</p>
<p>日本　二七、○○八　　九·三三　三七、○八三　一○·一○</p>
<p>輸出　　本季　　　　百分率　　　去年　　　　　百分率</p>
<p>美國　二九、四六五　二二·八三　二七、○八一　一七·一七</p>
<p>日本　一八、二八○　一四·一七　二六、二五九　一六·六五</p>
<p>英國　　八、六○四　　六·六七　　八、二○四　　五·二○</p>
<p>從這來看，除美國外，其他各國對中國貿易，尤其日本對中國之貿易，似乎一年减少一年，所謂排斥日貨之効力，似有不可磨滅之處。但實際上，日貨之减少，實不如統計上所表現之巨大，蓋密輸偷運之額，雖無統計柺查，而日人利用地理上接近之優越地位，大批的漏稅與偷運之貨，確較他國爲多。四月廿二日的字林西報，曾有這樣的記載：『年來有組織的私運團，以食糖「由後門」輸入中國，其數之巨，令人幾不之信，·····上年私運之數量，經證明者，共有十三萬四千噸，但其確數，恐去二十萬噸不遠丨丨私運之貨，有來自香港者，因食糖可免稅輸入香港也，有來自台灣者，因台灣爲運貨至中國海濱甚便利之根據地也，間有來自東三省者，台灣爲產糖之地，而邇來食糖輸入者日見增加，此可以想見私運之甚』。去年如此，今年恐更有甚於此者。食糖如此，其他商品，亦有賴此偷運者，例如人造絲一項，今年第一季的輸入總値爲四八九，六一四金單位，比去年同期之三·九一二·六一五金單位，要减少百分之七○以上，這種巨大的减少，單以購買力微弱來解釋是不够的，不消說的，這又是偷運品增大之故。而食糖與人造絲，皆爲日本主要輸出商品，是人所共知的，其欲在中國作偷運的傾銷，似無置疑必要。故統計表上日貨輸入之减少，實不能說是實際情形之反映。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>如果人們進一步來研究第一季的海關報告，則對於日貨在中國的傾銷，當更可明白。在貿易總額上，日貨雖有一般的减少傾向，然其中幾種商品，而且與中國的國民生活有密切關係的幾種商品，其在中國之行銷反而猛烈的增加着。</p>
<p>首先以人造絲及其製品來說，日本品之增加，是非常顯著的。在輸入總額三六二·五四二瓩之中（四八九·六一四金單位），德國所占　部分爲一五○·三九六瓩（二二五·四八六金單位），比之去年同期，激减三分之一。意大利品從去年六二○·八四三瓩（一·○二三·七一○金單位）减少百分之八八的僅僅七五·六七五　（一○三·八五二金單位），與去年同期占全額之半數相比，眞可說是悲慘的没落情形了。然而日本的人造絲則增至八二·一一八瓩（七七·六一○金單位），約增百分之一百八○以上，擠出意大利的地位而坐上第二位的位置。在人造絲織品方面，情形亦正相同，總額雖自去年的八五·二二三金單位降至二六·一五七金單位，其中英國品自三○三·九四一减至一二·八○七金單位，而日本品則自一·二七一金單位增到四倍上下的四·○二八金單位。</p>
<p>（人造絲）　　本季　　　　　　去年同期　　　　　（單位千瓩）</p>
<p>輸入總量　　　三六二、五四二　一、二七九、七三二</p>
<p>德國　　　　　一○五、三九六　　　四四六、八九六</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　八二、一一八　　　　二八、七六五</p>
<p>意大利　　　　　七五、六七五　　　六二○、八四三</p>
<p>（人造絲織品）　本季　　　　　　去年同期　　　　（單位海關金單位）</p>
<p>輸入總額　　　　二六、一五七　　　　八五、二二三</p>
<p>英國　　　　　　一二、八○七　　　　三二、九四一</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　四、○二八　　　　　一、二七一</p>
<p>這種可驚的增加速率，若與前面所說的偷運的人造絲進口照應來看，則日本人造絲進口的絶對量，可知也是很龐大的。</p>
<p>其次，便是海產物輸入的增加絲第一季海產總輸入額爲二、六五二、四六四金單位，比去年同期之四、○六五、八五六要减一、四一三、三九二金單位，卽減少了百分之三五，但日本的輸入，則從去年同期之八七四、四九五金單位，增至一、○二八、○○五金單位，增加了百分之一八弱。去年祇占總輸入百分之二一的日本品，今年第一季則占百分之四。弱了。而中國之漁產，則因「近年以來，外人（日人）每於漁汎時私自越海捕魚，以致漁民收獲减少，同時木質帆船被其撞沉或損壞漁網之類，損失甚巨。兼以魚銷之盛市，如滬南等處，均被日魚混售，以致銷數驟減，漁業大有遜色」了（浙東漁區報告）。茲錄日本傾銷的漁產如次，以供關心者之參考：（單位海關金元）</p>
<p>魚類品名　　　　　去年第一季　　　今年第一季</p>
<p>海參總額　　　　　四四六、九三入　三○七、二二六</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　一○四、九八六　一○五、一二五</p>
<p>鹽鰊總額　　　　　四一九、六四八　五三三、九五一</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　　九二、一三一　　九六、四五八</p>
<p>其他鹽魚總額　一、四三一、四三八　四四一、二七七</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　　三八、六五二　　五二、九八九</p>
<p>乾蝦總額　　　　　五一六、○二二　二七八、八六一</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　　一五、九九九　　一五、三六九</p>
<p>其他魚類及海產物</p>
<p>總額　　　　　一、二五一、八一○　一、○九一、一四九</p>
<p>日本　　　　　　　六二二、五九一　七、一五八、一四四</p>
<p>此外，日本毛織品和嗶嘰類之行銷中國，亦非常顯著。戰就輸入上海的第一季來看，絨線及毛織物總計爲一、八八六百瓩，比去年同期減一、一七二百瓩，價格亦自减少二○九、七六五金單位而爲三七一、七四三金單位，其中英國品减少一七八百瓩而爲一、一三六瓩，但日本品則增加了三九百瓩而達二四四百瓩，金額亦從三五○八三金單位增至五三、一六四金單位。至於嗶嘰類，則其推銷之猛烈，可說是空前的，無論在數量或在價格上，都壓倒了多年覇主的英國品，卽卽年英國品爲六三、九九七瓩，而本年减削到一九、四八五瓩之多，祗有四四、五一二瓩的輸入；日本品則從去年的一二、九九九瓩增加至五九、九○一瓩，凌駕了英國品的總額，從百分比來看，英國去年占總額百分之六三，而今年第一季慘减至百分之三七，日本品則從去年之百分之一三高增至百分之五○，其增加速度之激烈，可以想見日貨傾銷之猛晋。</p>
<p>同英國品競爭而獲得勝利的，尙有自由車及其部分品之輸入。本年第一季上海自由車部分品輸入總額，從去年同期的四四、三六四金單位增至八六、五八一金單位，其中日本品從去年的一八、八四八金單位增至三四、六四七，卽增加了百分之八四，而英國則自一八、九六八金單位增至三二、一五○金單位，然其百分比祗有百分之六九弱，不及日本之多（去年英國比日本多）。</p>
<p>此外如無綫電話機，三合土等皆有相當的增加。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>從上面簡單的檢查，已經可以知道，個别日本品在中國的傾銷，是非常猛烈的，而且這種趨勢，有繼續擴大之勢。第一因爲日英貿易戰爭正在醞釀，首當其衝的必是中國市塲上的英日競爭，日貨將用其「社會傾銷」的政策，以與英國品抗爭，卽在上面簡單的叙述中，亦已可窺見日貨反攻的猛烈，第二因爲在中日直接交涉的空氣之下，兩國的貿易商人，已有顯著的接近與默契，有利可圖之處，便是商人出入之地，故雖全國大衆反對日貨，抵制日貨，而商人推銷日貨如故，若在直接交涉之下，此輩更可藉「中日親善」的掩護而竭忠盡智的爲日貨作推銷之先驅，日商便可乘機作更大規模之傾銷；行見日貨的洪水，將完全　没中國微弱的工業。第三，日本政府已向中國提出要求减輕日貨進口稅率，南京政府已允所請，正在起草新的稅則，如果日人能如願以償，則今年日貨之進口，必將突飛猛晋，那是毫無疑問的。</p>
<h3>我國財政之病態及其改造</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>全國財政會議，在京開議。近方在這有組織的社會裏，財政學是應該成爲一種國民普通的常識。因爲那是吾人利害的所在，爰草本文，用以論列之。</p>
<p>我國是向來有財無政的。如其有政，那只能說是統治者的隨意揮耗和分配。直到國民政府成立以來，才能聽到幾聲整理財政的呼聲。可是他整理的結果，仍然未能使人滿意。所以我們在這次會議上，自然又想寄託以無窮的希望了。</p>
<p>所謂財政，原是由於住在一定地域的國民，縣民，市民，村民，共同一致的欲望而發生的。因爲在人類社會的共同生活上，一定有一種共同的利害關係。爲了建設共同的利益和去除共同的障害，便必有由一個權力的機關，代表大衆的利益，而依物質要件的收入和支出所確立的經濟秩序。這種秩序的功能和影響因爲有區域範圍的大小，所以也就分出了地方財政和國家財政的不同來。財政的發生，旣由於改善及保障全社會的共同生活的目的。所以他的財源之吸取，應該根據平等的原則。他的各啓的支付，應該以建設社會的福利爲目的。同時又因爲要維持這種秩序能立於合理的現象上，所以對於各年的財政預算應力求其平衡。可是在事實上，這往往成爲一種空想。因爲社會上旣包括着各種階層的人們，而各階層又各有其特殊生活形態。因此各階層的欲求和希望便不一致，財政的原理也就大有出入。因爲大公無私的世界，果然是誰都歡迎的；但在現實生活中，却就少見。不論是古今中外，財政的分配，往往是不公道的。中山先生的所以要竭力主張征收地價稅，也就是企圖減少人民在財政負擔上的不公道。連一位是本資本主義的經濟學者，財政學專家阿部賢一氏，在他的名著財政</p>
<p>政策論中也明白曉暢地說着：</p>
<p>人們是被告各個環境支配着。他的意見和欲望，是看他們各個的立塲而决定。在其意見和欲望相異的人們和階級之間，就發生相互間的利害衝突。實際上，許多財政上的立法，都是依代表各種利害關係的政黨之勢力的消長而决定的。···近代社會上利害和意見越有區分，其互相反叛之點也愈明顯。···若漫不考察實情，貿然樹立共同一致的財政政策，那不是架空，便是武斷。</p>
<p>現在我們有好大的造化，在中國國民黨的統治之下。本黨的施政，是依照總理的遺教而努力着國民革命，創造着全民政治的。所以我國今日所施用的財政原理，必然是以全民利益爲依據。而我們現在的希望，也就是望這種主張的實現</p>
<p>我國的財政，向來旣屬有財政政。積弊旣久，整理自然要困難特多。不過大體而論，我國財政的病態，不外兩端。一是人材的問題。一是分配的問題。人才的缺乏，廉潔的鮮有：前者不能充分的運用科學方法，加以整理和改造；後者使行政上弄得烏烟瘴氣，成爲個人的發財捷徑。關卡稅務，官塲中都目之謂缺，貪贓枉法，任用私人，時有所聞。今國内厲行新生活運動，謹祝其能有所整飾而廓清。吾等已有厚望焉，故不爲本文論題之中心。</p>
<p>本文的主題，在於分配問題。所謂分配，卽如何去汲取財政上的財源？如何去支付財政上的歲出？所以本問題内，又可分出兩個方面。一是歲入方面，一是歲出方面，有了收入，才能支出。量入爲出，是平衡財政的唯一方法。可是現在：平衡財政的對策，總是高唱節流開源。如能貨眞價實的節源，原也好事。最怕的是，未節其流而一味羅掘其源。看看我國目前情形，不幸正是這樣。如有國家預算（我否已確？是否實行？另一問題）以來，可謂年年如此。但看民國十六年以來，各年歲出增加的速率，還比歲入增加來得强悍。前年總算比二十年份都有减少之勢。（其實在實際上都未減少，而且一定還更多些。因爲那時滬案發生，軍費的支也，必定大增。但是這增加的都由民間自動捐集；只是没有編進預算上去罷了）可是一到去年，狐狸尾巴又露出原形來了。前年的歲出是七八八·三四六·六三七元；去年已增加到八二八·九二一·九六四元。增加達四千萬元以上。因此在歲入方面，也努力的開拓起來。於是去年的歲入比前年增加了五千八百七十萬元以上。可是結果還是一個收支不敷。其不敷額還是在一萬四千八百五十元以上。因此大舉了五千萬元美金的棉麥借欵之後，不久又來發行一萬萬元的關稅庫劵，外債内債，應有盡有。財政當局之努力，誠可謂鞠躬盡瘁矣。</p>
<p>然而這種病態，只是病態而已，病源另有所在。病源的所在，就在於不節其流而但闢其源。</p>
<p>我國財政支出上的洪流有二：一是運費，一是債務費。</p>
<p>在國家安全的政策上，社會治安的要求上，在目下的世界裏，當然不能没有軍警的設置。尤其在我國爲列强宰割下之今日，爲暴日侵凌下之今日；任何動人的外交令辭，並不能變更國界，怯退敵兵。我國過去的軍隊。惟一的任務，便是製造内亂；非特在糜費金錢，而且還殘害民衆。現在呢，因爲「攘外必先究内」「保國必先安民，」所以赤匪，和不服從的軍閥，不得不千鼓萬的鼓蕩平，當然也是在克盡衛國之大任。只是暴日的鐵艦和大砲；壓迫得我們太潑天猖狂了。我們總只覺得每年化下了這廣大筆的錢，還没有使自己在國防上築下相當的凖備；不能不呼寃哉枉也。</p>
<p>關於我國的軍費支出，就以去年而論，其總額已有四一五·六○○·○○○元。佔全部歲出的百分之五○·一四。但此尙僅爲國民政府勢力所及者。實際上如粤，桂，川，滇，靑，新，甘，晋，以及華北等省之在内國稅項下截留撥充者，多不在内。若彙合統計，全年軍費的支出，至少總有六七萬萬元左右。</p>
<p>與軍費同樣壓碎了我國財政的還有債務費。這是借債還債必然的結果。借債還債原是飲鴆止渴的一時權宜之計，可是我們却當做家常便飯，彌補不足的不二法門了。自民元以迄二十三年四月底，前後發行内國公債及具有公債性質之國庫證劵，凡五十九種。計前北京政府發行二十八種，前武漢國民政府發行一種。南京國民政府發行三十種。發行總數達國幣一·八六一·一五二·七八二元。截至二十三年四月底止。除逐年償還及收回八七三·三七七·一○九·七二元外，現負總數爲國幣銀九八七·七七五·六七二·二八元。而前北京財政整理會編印之財政部經營無確實担保内債表所列之其他短期國庫證劵約七十種。計現負本位尙有四○·五四二·一八一·八二元。前廣東國民政府十五年份發行之第一第三三次有獎公債，除已還本及註銷票外，尙欠毫洋一九·○八六·七七五·九二元。及十七年整理金融案内，發出金融公債毫洋三·三二六·五四六·五○元，兩項合計毫洋二二·四一三·三二三·四二元。以八折折合國幣計銀一七·九三○·六五七·九六元，及前武漢國民政府時期發行之漢口國庫劵計銀八·五九九·○五三元，均加入，則總額在現下已達銀一·○五四·八四七·五六五·○二元。内債之外，又有外債與賠欵。因此國家財政上每年爲償付債務而支出之數，長佔總歲出百分之三十左右。就以去年之債務費卽達二四一·八四一·八○四元；佔總歲出的百分之二九·一八，將軍費的歲出合併起來，兩者的每年支出，便佔去了總歲出的百分之八十以上。因此我國的財政預算，可說只是軍務費及債務費的支付預算罷了，這兩者的支出數，將現有的財政</p>
<p>三大財源（一）關稅（二）鹽稅（三）統稅的全部歲收，差不多還抵銷不了。</p>
<p>但是財政原是想改善國民共同生活的，結果，該兩項便占去了百分之八十以上。因此剩餘的百分之二十，如能全部爲人民利益而支出，尙不無稍補。可是事實上在我國機關林立，名目繁多，因此都爲官薪政費而分配掉；留給以實業費交通費建設費名下的，也都只爲行政費而支出。眞能直接支付於生產事業上的，幾等於零，卽有，亦不過千分之幾或萬分之幾而已。爲淸眉目起見，茲將去年度的預算槪算列表如下，</p>

<h3>未來的大戰與日本資本主義的出路</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>要是我們不是「善忘」的，那當然還記得，在一九一四年的第一次世界大戰暴發的前夜，是呈現着怎樣的情狀與怎樣的局面，最明顯的：就是那野心的德國帝國主義的妄想稱覇，所以牠一方面竭立的與英，法，俄等諸帝國主義列强作劇烈的商戰；而另一方面就日夜的擴充陸海軍備，以威脅法，俄的陸軍與英國的海軍。故到後就免不了大家拚火，來上一次大厮殺，把大自然中的一部份竟像移山倒海似的在一連數年中大閙了一回。結果，大家終於筋疲力盡的把那强覇的德國主義暫時的征壓下去了。同時，那一般弱小的被牽入於戰禍中的國家都被那些戰勝（？）國，像魚肉般的任牠們宰割而爲恢復牠們自己固有的榮繁（？）去了，同時，我們也得看到，在大戰的末期，那個參戰國帝俄國裏是起了怎樣大的變化。</p>
<p>在當時，在一般的統治者，就只顧瘋狂地驅使着國内無辜的民衆去爲他們充作「肉彈丸」，爲了祖國，爲了本份。但是，在帝俄國的被迫的下層民衆，到底任不住的呌了出來：「反對繼續參戰」：由此這國裏更另起了一個大劇變而打出了一條新的路綫與新的發展。</p>
<p>同樣，在這時我們又看見這個，在大戰前的國際的經濟關係底國際的分業主義時代，只是爲製絲業的日本，在大戰時與大戰後的經濟國家主義之下，以狡巧的手段，與「不正當的競爭」（這是各國所公認的），固被一躍而也爲國際資本主義舞臺上的一個重要角色興少壯的戰士了。</p>
<p>本來，要以這個「弭戰之戰」丨歐戰，而想就可「一勞永逸」，是在當時戰事進行中諸參戰恊約國都這麽想的；但是，事實上終不能有這樣簡單與便宜的吧！這只要稍留意自第一次大戰以來的種種現象與變遷，和現階段所呈現的情勢，是誰也不會相信的吧！</p>
<p>看吧！處心積慮了多年的「大陸政策」，「獨覇東亞」；已在進行中的「亞洲門羅主義」··這都是最明顯的公開的，比第一次戰爭時的德帝國主義者還要强覇的日本帝國主義的野心與策略；牠久已被各國所公認了的「產業和平之敵」，正縱横椑闔的在與各國商戰。另一方面就竭力的在擴充軍備，預備與牠們作最後的解决丨第二次的大兵戰，這是决不能少的。但是最近我們看見本報載華聯社東京通訊一則，到是很可以注意的：「據日軍部調查，日壯丁受兵役檢查者，農民最多；居全數之三十四分；工業工人居二十七分；商家子弟居十七分；其餘僅二十二分。所謂農工商業者受檢查者，其地位均爲無產者，足見日軍隊中之七成八分爲無產階級之出身，日軍部提倡對外戰爭，必須先解决國内之工農之不安··」的確，這可到不是玩的吧！</p>
<p>但是根本上，這是在資本主義國家内所不可避免的，因爲在客觀的事實上；在一切資本主義國家内，工業終是比農業發展得更快，這原因是：每年從佃農那裏，地主們必要收到幾萬萬的租金，而不久，這些欵子便就變成了有價證劵，股票，銀行存欵，以及其類似的東西。因此，這幾萬萬元的金錢就從農村裏全去而不返；逼樣，就無疑地造成了城市和農村間銳利的對立，這也就是資本主義國裏的經常的内在予盾；而這種矛盾，也正是各資本主義要想用殖民地的剥削來解决的。但同時，我們也須注意：由於國民的財富，集中到少數人的手裏，就自然地擴大與發展了整個工人階層的結合；更由於大衆的貧乏與那不可免的財閥及軍閥們的永續不斷的鬥爭，和統治者的「窮兵黷武」的爭覇，增加了一般民衆的對於現實情狀的不滿與憎惡，因此就汎濫地造成了公開的種種反抗運動··這種種，不單只是日本資本主義，就在一切的資本主義列强内與國際資本主義舞臺上，所永不能削去而反在日益尖銳化的極大的矛盾。</p>
<p>但是，今日正又到了第二次解决的世界大戰的前夜了，不論這個比第一次大戰時的德帝國主義要强狠午多少，也不論　爲了要得到各資本主義者的同情而作了牠們的先鋒，去與蘇聯的社會主義國家開戰，或者竟不能容忍而就與别的帝國主義去作個你死我活，但在戰爭時，終不能不要「肉彈丸」丨兵士，的吧！但是由於過去的客觀的事實，一般的人都已承認：「戰爭常是革命的酵母」丨像帝俄就是最闡明的證據，那末，日本資本主義在這一次大戰中的出路是什麽，想可「不言共喻」的了！雖有遲，早，那我們當不能斷言，但這不過是時間上的問題吧了！</p>
<h3>馬二先生的「不說話」</h3>
<p>— 少岑</p>
<p>馬二先生在泰山上頭修身養性的讀了一回書，長久没有發表什麽談話了。一時似乎也被人忘記了。</p>
<p>這回大祇是心血來潮，抑或不曉得吃錯了什麽東西，悶得難過，於是不得不下泰山來到處玩玩了。</p>
<p>我想想，在泰山上頭念書，這是一椿很妙的事，幽雅淸靜，宜於修身養性，以備治國平天下。然而馬二先生終覺太寂寞了，况且讀書不過是一種方法，也無非是萬不得已的事。</p>
<p>中國的官，则無須乎讀書不讀書的，只要你先生手頭有槍桿兒，佔了個地盤，於是你便是赫赫的大官了。可不是？我們馬二先生過去是行伍出身的，後來什麽了不起的總司令部長都幹過了。而且滿肚子還是學問呢。</p>
<p>中國的軍人政客畢竟和外國不同的。在勢的時候，便是什麽都懂，什麽也内行，什麽都能幹，本領天大，變成萬能，然而一失勢後，什麽也不懂了，感覺自己的缺陷，於是讀書，考察，遊歷，忙個不了，這只是一種手段而已。</p>
<p>在勢的時候是個啞巴，在野的時候是隻老虎，是隻杜鵑，他會一怒驚人，他會一唱百和。然而一上了臺上，他就和從前不同，一樣也是個啞巴呢。</p>
<p>馬二先生這次在蓬萊的「不說話」，發了一塲大牢騷，在我們百姓聽來，固然十分悅耳。</p>
<p>因爲他想救國，但没有救國機會給他，他想抗敵，又没有權柄交給他，老把他看作門外漢，不使他闖進大門一步，這更使馬二先生氣憤不過的事了。</p>
<p>馬二先生現在是閒着的，所以心地比較淸爽些，知道一個人有話不能說的苦了。知道被壓迫下的生命是如何說不出的悲痛了。可是，千萬不要忘了，這是事實，不要只會說話，希圖博得百姓的同情，倘自己來擔任大官的時候，什麽也不氣了，什麽也不苦了，什麽也不必去說了。環境是兩樣的，這樣的事，中國的在野人物是惯用的。苦的只是百姓。</p>
<h3>認眞</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>「大事化爲小，小事化爲無」，這是我們中國人的處世哲學。不管是對人還是處事，起初總是來勢凶凶，熱熱烈烈，但，過無幾時，也就馬馬虎虎，含糊了之。所謂虎頭蛇尾，指的就是這個。由這裏，也就足够地表露出中國人處事的不大認眞的態度來。</p>
<p>不過，所謂不大認眞，是有一個界限的。這界限，就是要看當前的情勢如何，和事情的對於自身的利害怎樣而定：要是自己是一個强者，雖是因了一點小小的事體，也非認眞地辦個澈底不可</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>；爲認眞究竟起見，對於對方甚至施與最苛刻殘忍的手段，也算不得什麽；但，如果自己是一個弱者，或事勢看來於已不大利時，開首先來張聲作勢，做個威嚇姿態，如果對方不被嚇倒，就以「明天再來和你算帳」的一句話，來爲自己掩飾，而一溜烟溜走了。</p>
<p>我國古來之士，每當官運亨通，萬事應手時，則崇尙儒教，教人當守着「君君臣臣，父父子子」之道，各安其分；及至一旦失意，落魄潦倒時，又轉來推崇佛道，痛斥做官爲卑污陋劣，大不如出家歸隠，來得閒適淸高。作「三都賦致洛陽紙貴的左思，也算是十分超脫，看破人世的了，但讀他的「詠史詩」，看他何嘗没有做官的塵想？詩仙李白，也算是高邁豪放，鄙棄功名利錄的了，但讀他的「上韓荆州」文，看他何嘗不是渴望着荆州起用他？這一些，雖可說是由於人的自私自利心使然，但，對事的不認眞，也不能說不是一因。</p>
<p>讀世界史至爲欲普救衆生，而擲棄皇冠的鄱迦牟尼；爲了眞理，而從容不迫服毒的蘇格接底，我總不覺爲他們偉大的認眞精神而掩嘆佩！</p>
<p>我們偌大的中國，爲甚總不見這樣認眞的人出現？是否「不認眞」，原就是我們　　之邦的風度之一呢？</p>
<h3>理髮店</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>我生平怕進理髮店，理由有三：</p>
<p>第一，我是喜歡動的，我受不了拘束，要我在理髮店裏坐一個多鐘頭，實在比坐牢還苦。尤其是要完全服從理髮師的命令，他呌你的頭正一點就正一點，歪一點就歪一點。這種機械式的無味工作實在不是一個發動的靑年所能忍受得了的。</p>
<p>第二，我有神經衰弱的毛病，我喜歡胡思亂想。我常常這樣想：要是理髮師不愼把剃刀割進我底咽喉，或者把剪刀軋去我底頭皮：更或者電氣摩面時漏了電····我該怎樣辦？越想越怕，總於使我一見着理髮店就像見了老虎一樣。</p>
<p>第三個原因，也就是最大的原因，就是我怕見店裏的小學徒底那種可憐的哭喪臉。我一看見他們，心裏就會難過起來，我覺得世界上没有比做小學徒更可憐一些的人。</p>
<p>有一次，我爲了頭髮長得實在太不像樣了，硬着頭皮衝進一家理髮店。照例有一個小學徒遞上一杯茶和一面手巾來。那小學徒只有十一二歲，面色黄黄的一些血色也没有，更可異的就　他的一雙眼睛腫得像核桃一樣，眼角上還掛着兩滴晶瑩的淚珠。我一看他那樣子，就知道他受過委屈了。</p>
<p>無意中和理髮師談起了那個小學徒，當時我問他爲什麽哭得眼泡都腫起來。</p>
<p>理髮師淡淡的笑了一笑道：「受了師傅的一頓打。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽打呢？怪可憐的！」</p>
<p>「他自己尋死啊！」理髮師不在意地說：「方才一個客人來，師傅呌他倒茶，他正在洶米，匆忙中，把一籃米倒翻啦！眞該打，一些都不留神。」</p>
<p>『他不是還很小嗎？要他做這樣做那樣，也够苦了！」我以了一口氣。</p>
<p>「小？十三歲了呢！不打總不做人！」</p>
<p>我默然了。我没有方法帮助那些可憐的小學徒，我慚愧，不敢再瞧見那些可憐的面孔。</p>
<p>因此，我怕進理髮店。除非我的頭髮長得有被認爲囚犯的資格時才勉强去一趟。一踏進理髮店，我馬上就閉了我</p>
<p>底眼睛。</p>
<h3>弗如意傳（十二）</h3>
<p>— 忘我</p>
<p>春天裡的秋夜恋愛時期的贈照</p>
<h3>談筆墨紙</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>有人說筆墨紙與一個國家的文化有了密切的關係，野蠻人是没有筆墨紙的，所以野蠻人是没有文化。這話初聽來，似乎很有道理，可是，這話不能够在現代對於現代世界的文化上來說，如果追問上去，在古代，有筆墨紙的國家就没有。考我們中國的古昔對於文章的紀錄用的是漆畫，那自然是没有墨與紙，筆呢亦自然並非現在用的毛筆了。在當時古人的爲文著書，用竹簡以漆書之，然後以皮條結束成篇，孔子讀書三律三絶，在著書者已經十分困難，在藏書與讀書者亦倍加艱苦，然而古人的讀書反而比較科學昌明時代爲學生用功得多，這一層看來，學風不如古的話，似乎可信。這且不在話下，却說筆這物件自古以來與文人特别有密切的關係，史籍詩詞裏頭提起筆兄的比較提起墨與紙多得多，古人且有「夢筆生花」以爲做得好文章的預兆，科舉時代文人的神那魁星爺爺也手裏拿住一枝大筆，而「西廂記」還稱讚牠的神威，「筆尖兒横掃五千人」。到了歐西文化侵入中國以後，毛筆已受鋼筆鉛筆自來水筆打擊不小，今年廣東政府下令提倡學生用毛筆以塞漏巵，便是保存國粹的意思。不但是毛筆己經發生危險，就是鋼筆鉛筆亦何曾不是已經要受洶汰；在外國用打字機的文學作家以及商店公司官家機關都是用打字機作文作信了。將來筆這東西，怕也就與文化無關了。至於墨，在中國那是佔了漆的地位而代興了的，可是現在用鋼筆自來水筆的人已經又將藥水製造的墨水代替了牠，將來用毛筆的人一少，墨也是要没落了的。中國紙更悲哀啦，現在除了書畫家用的宣紙以外，只有商店的賬簿用的紙是國貨的，書籍報紙（除連史紙外）都用的是舶來品。可是，紙無論是國貨與舶來品牠還是紙，不比墨根本就被藥水的墨水替代了去，又不比筆將來被打字機洶汰，而且文化事業越發達，紙的用途越大，將來對於紙是人人所逺需的了。</p>

<h3>封建淫威下之弱女子</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>今將黟縣五都封建淫威下之弱女子，歷受惡姑虐待，丈夫遺棄，叔嫂帮兇，求生不得，飲恨而死，等實况奉聞，務祈公諸報端，並加公正評語，則不但死者寃氣得以稍舒，留心婦女問題者亦可認淸其努力之方向矣。</p>
<p>有鳳意者黟縣五都反溪村信友之長女也，家寒，自幼憑媒許嫁本都南屏葉村葉芳光之長子玉椿爲室，過門後初尙相安，乃自芳光第三媳娶一富家女子後，其姑欺貧趨富，態度忽變，威壓高施，無所不至，一切勞苦工作，如　種院　等，均　其一人承任，偶不當意，笞策隨之；，猶須强歡忍受，不敢稍有啼拗，否則變本加厲，須勒令服禮（淫威之禮也）而後止。以故鳳意常體無完膚，創痕纍纍，而勞苦工作仍不敢一日稍怠也。其第二媳亦寒家女，雖同受虐待，而尙不及鳳意之苦；第三媳則終日淸閒，反而助姑爲虐，凌辱鳳意。而其所夫，每一歸來，白眼相加，情同陌路，甚而婢喚奴差，幫终毆駡，鳳意之苦况，誠非一般人所可想象及矣。</p>
<p>自與其姑析炊後（按尙同屋而居，不過析炊而已：一切用度均須自操女紅。）三年中僅獲其夫十四元之供給，在此生活程度高張之際，此區區者將敷何用；其夫偶而家居，尙須耗用其私蓄，渠非失業，所入頗足内顧，今竟如此非蓄意遺棄而何。鳳意是一舊家女子，惟有夫妻敦好，婆媳和睦生活始有依恃，今其遭遇若是，夫復何言。徒有自嗟命蹇而已。舊年春，其弟自滬歸，鳳意屢次對之淚訴苦情，並支處境惡劣，若長此以往，勢必折挫以死，其弟亦計無可施，惟有多方寛慰，且爲之重新與姑析居冀省煩惱，殊不知其姑有意留難，又提出許多苛刻條件，迫令承允鳳意無法，一一服從，故雖分居而其姑之壓迫，羹未絲毫間斷，毒打怒駡一如往昔；其夫亦横目皷拳，跳駡不休。鳳意在此環境下，自無生存之理，今者香魂渺渺，果赴黄泉嗚呼！亦云慘痛矣；</p>
<p>鳳意無父母，祇一弱弟，鳳意死後，其弟舉目無親自歎孤苦，更何能爲姊復仇。鄙人爲此爭深爲憤憊故特不揣冒眛，懇請先生指示，辦法爲鳳意解恨則不勝感激矣專頌</p>
<p>撰安余柏壽頓首</p>
<p>編者按：像鳳意這樣的身世，所受到的凌辱，在這個社會内並不怎樣希罕；依我想，同命運的人也不在少數假如鳳意活着，還可想辦法補救，雖然並不能使她得到根本解放；然而她現在是死了，這還有什麽辦法解恨呢？雖則是他們丨姑，嫂，夫，丨逼死的，然而能够告他們殺人罪麽！我還能加什麽「公正評語」，但，把這椿事實暴露出來，也許能使「留心婦女問題者亦可認淸其努力之方向」因此决計公表了這封信。</p>

<h3>MADAM　X（六）</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>「小王！」低低地從血紅的小唇中飄過來，她更扮了個鬼臉。</p>
<p>考爾門的眼珠子威力地射了說話的舞女一眼，右手緊摟着蛇樣的腰肢，那個扭動了身軀微笑着低聲說：「别那樣兒！」</p>
<p>「對不起，殷太太。」鬢髮拂過他的希佛萊的鼻子。</p>
<p>音樂停了，敏蓀扶太太歸原座。</p>
<p>「那個舞女認識的吧？」殷太太問。</p>
<p>紳士點點頭。</p>
<p>「上海的女子没有咱們北平的漂亮！」這句話祇合敏蓀面前的美麗的太太說。</p>
<p>「漂亮的北平太太！」紳士從小桌子俯近頭低微地說。</p>
<p>「可是北平的男子没有上海的漂亮！」</p>
<p>滿意地扭動着希佛萊的嘴巴，整整領帶，音樂又響了。</p>
<p>上海没有時間，舞塲裏更没有日子，每一顆心想從對方的身上滿足自己的慾念，軟肉和硬幣交換着。流着脂粉的膩汗，飲着血色的可可，靈魂在音樂的節拍中打轉，一次，二次，五次，緊張的臉，興奮的心。</p>
<p>太太香喘微微的手灣枕着頭，多情的紳士像春風一樣在太太的鬢邊吹着：「殷太太，樓上去罷。」</p>
<p>扶了蛇樣的腰肢，古羅馬的武士般歸三百五十六號。</p>
<p>太太御了黑色的上衣，擋着迎面吹來的春風，向侍者要了一杯白蘭地，她仰起頭來直灌到𩓐子裏去。</p>
<p>紳士也感到微微的疲乏，投進沙發椅裏，抽出衣襟上的絲巾拭着額角。</p>
<p>太太魔術家似的恢復了活潑的態度，嬉笑着在敏蓀的面前跳躍，乳房彷彿要從絲質的襯衣内跳出來，考爾門的眼珠子隨了那頂點盤旋。</p>
<p>「瞧什麽？没有瞧够？」一個旋身投進紳士懷裏。</p>
<p>「殷太太！」心飛出了腔子。</p>
<p>「鼠膽！你以爲我是君揚的太太？」</p>
<p>？？？</p>
<p>「上海的漂亮男子！」兩手鈎了他的頭頸，大聲的笑起來。</p>

<h3>小市民層與中國電影（下）</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>有一部分小市民在這種情勢下找到了正確的世界觀的路子，但是大部分還逗留在原來的落後世界觀中。不過，他們已經漸漸的知道神秘的幻夢的靠不住，於是，武俠片中淡薄的對現實的不滿，在「姊妹花」中更見鮮明深刻了，而武俠片的神必色彩亦代之以階級間糢糊的界限的幻想。</p>
<p>因爲文明戲自峰的歷史的發展的關係，倒很接觸於社會的現實的，每一件轟動社會的黄色新聞，在文明戲舞台上也一定能大出風頭。不過，並不一定照原來事實搬演，而須經過一度改編，這改編後的東西，確很能表現小市民的落後世界觀，很能迎合低級趣味的。</p>
<p>但是，近來也一般的可以看到關於反帝的英雄崇拜主義的作品，而「姊妹花」居然亦被搬上了文明戲舞台。</p>
<p>那麽，中國電影將如何獲取廣大小市民觀衆？「姊妹花」或甚至文明戲的道路呢？還是别一條道路？</p>
<p>「姊妹花」的成功，證明了現在廣大小市民層的確對於現實是很不滿的，只是「姊妹花」從這種對於現實的不滿中引出了幻想。</p>
<p>這種幻想，實際上是存在的，但小市民意識的代表者，却不看見他們的幻想的破滅的必然，結果便把這種幻想强調起來，歪曲了事實。</p>
<p>假如我們能够從「姊妹花」學習些什麽，那便是對於醜惡的現實的暴露，表現了小市民層對於現實的不滿。</p>
<p>然而「姊妹花」的幻想的成分究意是要不得的。我們假如要獲取小市民層而不是追隨小市民層，則丢棄這種幻想的成分，儘量根據小市民層對於現實的不滿，給他們以相當的啟示是必要的。</p>
<p>所謂儘量根據小市民層的不滿於現實，當然不是說站在小市民世界觀上，因爲從小市民世界觀出發，總要掩蔽住一部分事實，只有以澈底的現實主義才能够動人的表現出來。</p>
<p>在這裏，勝利的一定是澈底的現實主義。（完）</p>

<h3>評「寡婦淘金記」</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>Ｈavana　Widows丨南京</p>
<p>「哈伐那的寡婦」，寫的并不是哈伐那地方的死了丈夫的婦人，而是寫兩個歌女，怎樣見到舊時的同事出賣肉體，變成了個富家少婦，使她們羨慕着，到哈伐那去，尋她們的買主丨</p>
<p>這兩個歌女的虚榮，似乎是很可笑的，但是我們只須想一想，每一個人都有着生存得好一點的企求，舊時的歌女，今日的富家少婦的葛蘭第，對於没有正確的認識的梅和薩蒂，當然是種誘惑，我們從這裏可以知道，虚榮不僅是人們的惡德，而非加以針砭就可了事的，這是不合理的社會制度下的必然產物，非根本上改革社便制度不容易打破這種觀念的。</p>
<p>其次，我們可以看到，挺着大肚子的富人，有的是錢，而女人們有的是鮮艷的肉體，他們的目的在於肉體，她們的眼睛是只看見發光的黄金，這就是現在所謂的戀愛！</p>
<p>梅雖然愛上了富人的兒子巴勃，但是爲了錢，只能愛富人，在巴勃也變成了一無所有的窮人，他們才能結合，正表現了所謂戀愛的把戲的又一面。</p>
<p>歌女們爲了要去「淘金，」不得不以謊言來借錢，而造的謊，又是什麽，母親害病，這一刻劃極深的天眞的少女的畫幅是很的好。</p>
<p>富人迭德愛上了歌女，但在善妒的　的面前，連忙以責備兒子來掩飾自己，這一可愛的諷刺，剥去了紳士先生們的僞君子的外衣丨</p>
<p>他如律師的設計索詐，漢門的冒簽支票，這些都是現社會中每天都在演着的活劇。</p>
<p>然而，這些暴露，僅只觸到男女關係上的醜惡，是多麽不够的，所有的一些諷刺，也是這樣的無力，「寡婦淘金記」其實只是小市民層對於現實不滿的一些表現。</p>
<p>我們看吧丨在發洩了一些抑鬰的不滿之後，終究來了一個happyˉending，雖然洶金成了一個幻夢，却正和夢想賽馬得中頭獎一樣的異曲同工。</p>
<p>瓊白郎黛兒和格蘭大弗蘭爾的演技，尤其前者，是成功的，因爲他們都能把握住角色的個性。這一部作品，是因了它二人的勞績而生色的，如她們對漢門說謊，及與迭更周旋的幾塲。</p>
<p>導演的手法，尙稱盡職，惟若干不必要的噱頭是其缺點。</p>
<h3>評「紅粉記者」Ｈold　That　Girl丨大上海</h3>
<p>— 憶君</p>
<p>一切現實的醜惡都給粉紅色的喜劇的彩色掩蓋住了。</p>
<p>記者，偵探，這二個人同是現社會制度的忠臣，而盜匪，惡徒，都是現社會制度的蠹虫，於是，在現社會制度的維護者的没落的電影故事編作者的心眼裏，對於他們的忠臣得加以獎勵，給予他們以圓滿的報償，對於他們的蠹虫便得加以穂罰，給予他們以「罪有應得」的果報。</p>
<p>精幹的女記者和勇敢的偵探，得到了圓滿的結褵，盜匪惡徒都死在覆車之下，這些正是「紅粉記者的編作者秉承了他們主人的對於「善者報償，惡者懲罰」的意志。</p>
<p>爲了要拉長幾千尺的膠片，爲了要對於最後的圓滿的結褵，更增加劇的效果，依照着老例，「紅粉記者」的編劇者便挿八了記者的新聞的採訪，因往晤瘋漢而被禁，因約期叙談不獲而被禁，因珠寳店遭刦，往緝查而被匪禁，編劇者在這裏來了個三禁女記者，幸虧我們勇敢的偵探三次求出，匪類剿滅顯出了偵探的恩情深重，劇情旣極曲折，最後的Ｈ的appyˉending也得了莫大的效果，幾千尺膠片也得以拉長。</p>
<p>然而，陳舊的導演手法，陳舊的荒唐的笑料，陳舊的空想的巧遇，陳舊的戀愛的喜劇，恐怕連上述編劇者的初意，也不能完滿的達到。</p>
<p>荒唐，兒戲，開玩笑，在最後還不能免俗地來上一套肉感的跳舞，這一切難道就是電影藝術的眞價，就是軟片電</p>
<p>影的軟性嗎？</p>
<p>然而，我們還不能忽略「紅粉記者」告訴了我們偵探的勇敢，倜儻，瀟灑，而掩蔽住了慘酷的面目。在美麗的面幕後面是藏着多麽兇狠的眞相啊！開電椅時的殘狠，最近的美國碼頭上的槍擊和毒打，以至「亡命者裏的兇狠的追逐，這些都是鐵一般的事實呀！</p>
<p>但，在「紅粉記者」裏，一切現實的醜惡，都給紅粉色的喜劇的彩色掩蓋住了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>觀「紅粉鐵血」後</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>根據劇情，我們知道這「紅粉鐵血」是一部暴露舊軍閥罪惡的作品，但作者因忽略了偉大的現實，而只從女人的故事上演進，所以對於國家社會仍是無甚影響，最多只是一部舊軍閥的「内部穢史」吧了！</p>
<p>從演出方面看來，我們可看出作者的粗心，像啓幕時動物園的那一塲，那麽長的一段特寫，但除了作戲的角兒外，非但是没有半個遊客，「簡直連一個園丁也没有。」如旅長的司令部，局面也不算小了，但畫面上映出的有幾扇門，竟全是紙紥的，當旅長被殺後，許多的護兵，竟力推而不能開，這未免太近於滑稽了。其餘的幾幕雪景，也是不能使我們滿意的，尤其是最後拖了那麽一條「光明的尾巴」更是無聊之至！</p>
<p>演員王元龍是依然故我。湯傑比較最逼眞。蕭正中完全在作文明戲。最失敗的要算吳一笑所飾的馬副官，關於個性的表演，是全没有的。導演者也應當負其全責吧。</p>
<h3>菲律賓的影業瑣談</h3>

<p>在美國統治下的菲律賓，無疑的，大部分的影片都是由美國電影界供給的。所以美國的銀星在菲律賓亦是很有名的。聽說其中他們最歡迎的就是平克勞斯貝。</p>
<p>菲律賓自己亦攝製影片的，大的攝影塲一共有三所，其中有一所是由美國合資開設的。</p>
<p>誰都知道，菲律賓的氣候是非常熱的，並且五月後就漸漸地進入雨季，每天就要不停地下雨了，爲了這緣故，菲律賓這地方是非常不適於攝製影片的，所以電影亦是永遠没有發達之希望的。</p>
<p>除了默片外，聲片中的對白都是用馬尼刺附近的土語之故，所以我們可以想見，他們的聲片，除了馬尼刺及其附近外，並不能在各地普遍地放映。至於菲律賓的默片，爲適合各地之情形起見，片上有英語，西班牙語及馬尼刺土語三種字幕。</p>
<p>在菲律賓各大商埠都設立着電影院，其中甚至有比上海的大上海，大光明還要富麗堂皇的，他們的門票都售得很貴，大槪都是菲幣一培縮（合華幣一元七八角）至三培縮左右。一天大都放映三次。可是第一流的電影院因爲日間太熱的緣故，所以只不過在夜間放映。</p>
<p>菲律賓的電影院換片時的宣傳方法是非常有趣的。他們都是用裝貨汽車，在汽車的兩邊掛上新片的照牌，奏着留聲機，到處遊行。</p>

<h3>Closing of the Finance Conference; The Last General Meeting Was Held Yesterday Morning; Secretary-General Qin Fen Read the Declaration; Both Wang Zhaoming and Dai Chuanxian Delivered Speeches; Final General Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Finance Conference held its final general meeting at 10:30 AM on the 27th. There were 125 members in attendance and 9 members were excused. Wang Zhaoming and Dai Jitao also attended the meeting. Chairman Kong Xiangxi reported on the receipt of documents: (1) A petition from the Ping County Travelers Association of Ji Tong County requesting a thorough investigation and elimination of various harsh and miscellaneous taxes in Tong County, which was handed over to the Ministry of Finance for handling; (2) A request from the Xiamen Shipping Association to abolish the ship tax, a telegram has been sent to prohibit the levy. Afterwards, various cases were discussed.</p>
<p>(1) Peng Xuepei reported on the review by the first group regarding the regular and additional land taxes, and plans to reduce additional taxes in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The main points of this case were to discuss the amount of regular and additional land taxes in each province, the annual income, and specific plans to reduce regular and additional taxes. There were dozens of reports from various provinces. After sorting, it was reduced to eighteen pages. The collection of regular and additional land taxes in the northern provinces was not heavy, but the temporary apportionments were the biggest problem, which has been requested to be prohibited in a separate case. The regular and additional land taxes in the southern provinces were relatively heavy, and in some cases, the regular tax was light but the additional tax was too heavy. The results of the review were sent to the Ministry of Finance for review. After Peng Xuepei's report, the chairman consulted the opinion of the assembly, and it was resolved to pass the review results.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Changheng made a temporary motion, which was seconded by Wei Tingsheng, Ma Yinchu, Li Quanshi, Wang Zhixin, Zhang Xinglian, and others, requesting that the salt tax of each province be collected uniformly. Chen Changheng explained the reasons for this case, saying that the salt tax is a national tax and should be collected uniformly by the central government. The Ministry of Finance has already organized the additional collections from Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces. However, some provinces are still levying taxes in the name of local governments. It is requested that all such additional items be abolished and incorporated into the regular tax, which will be collected uniformly by the central government. Separate subsidy measures should be formulated for the provinces that originally levied additional taxes: 1. For those with existing fixed quotas, the original amount will be maintained; 2. For those with special regulations, the original regulations will be maintained; 3. For those recovered this time, the subsidy amount will be determined based on the actual income of the previous year, according to the previous successful case of recovery. The assembly considered this case to be extremely appropriate and resolved to pass the original proposal.</p>
<p>(3) The case of rectifying local finances and abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies was passed unanimously without objection. Chairman Kong believed that this case was important and asked all members of the assembly to stand up to express their approval. Wei Tingsheng spoke, saying that he requested the financial administration to provide full legislative convenience, and hoped that the chairman, as the financial officer, would instruct his subordinates not to violate the law. Wei Tingsheng also listed the Cigarette Regulations, which had been amended five times, which was truly unfortunate. Chairman Kong added an explanation, saying that everyone should abide by the law and he did not think anyone would violate the law. As for the amendment of the Cigarette Tax Regulations, it had gone through procedures such as approval by the Executive Yuan and decisions on principles by the Central Political Council, so he was afraid that the outside world would not be very clear. The cigarette tax was in the trial period, and corrections would be made if it was not feasible in practice. Laws were rigid, so the reorganization of tax affairs and the trial implementation of tax collection were only subject to the principle approval of the Central Political Council, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan after the results were available. Kong made encouraging remarks at the end, saying that the current government was on the right track and hoped that everyone would abide by the law. China was a country ruled by law, and acting in accordance with the law would provide guarantee. After speaking, the declaration of the assembly was discussed, and the draft was read by the secretary. After Chen Changheng, Xiao Zheng, and others made supplementary opinions and modifications, it was passed. The motion on restoring the old system of supervisory organs and abolishing the administrative methods兼攝by audit personnel was rejected by the assembly, and the original motion was withdrawn. The discussion ended at 12 o'clock. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Finance Conference held its final general meeting on the 27th, a grand closing ceremony was held immediately. Chairman Kong Xiangxi performed the ceremony as usual. First, Secretary-General Qin Fen read the declaration of the conference. After the reading, the entire venue applauded. Then Kong invited Wang and Dai to give speeches, followed by Kong's closing remarks. Finally, Liang Jingchun delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all members. After the speech, a photograph was taken and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Speeches by Wang and Dai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Finance Conference closed on the 27th. President Wang attended the meeting and gave instructions, the general idea of which was that the day the meeting concluded was also the day the various resolutions began to be implemented. Whether the resolutions could be implemented depended on whether the government and the people could cooperate, and whether the central government and the local governments could cooperate. He then said that the way to enrich national strength was to develop the strength of the people. However, to develop the strength of the people, it must be cultivated. In recent years, the rural areas have been devastated and the people have been extremely impoverished. Not only should the negative aspects be strictly prohibited from the肆虐 of corrupt and arrogant officials, so as to allow the people to recuperate, but also the positive aspects should be advocated and rewarded to increase production. Now the Ministry of Finance is willing to sacrifice a large amount of revenue from the national treasury and work hard to reward the production of agricultural and industrial products, either by exempting or reducing taxes. The Ministry of Railways has also reduced freight charges for various agricultural products. However, at this time, the central government and local governments must cooperate. If the central government reduces export taxes and reduces freight charges, but the local governments levy harsh and miscellaneous taxes, the people will still not be able to obtain real benefits, and the goal of encouraging production will still be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the development of the strength of the people cannot be achieved without the central and local governments working together with one heart. When the Finance Conference opened, I explained the painful contradiction between enriching national use and cultivating the strength of the people. Now, this kind of pain has been relieved through the painstaking efforts and determination of all of you in the daily meetings, and various plans have been proposed. These plans have also been solemnly approved by the conference. I am deeply grateful for your painstaking efforts and determination, and I encourage myself and encourage you to implement them with this painstaking effort and determination, so that the suffering of the people can be relieved, and the painful contradiction in our hearts can also be relieved. I am truly grateful and offer my prayers. Then Dai Chuanxian gave a speech, roughly saying that he watched the conference work hard and conscientiously, which increased the infinite strength and infinite hope of the country and the people. China is a poor country, and the people are poor people. The Finance Conference is a poor housekeeper holding a poor conference to find opportunities to make money and hope to make money. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the Principle of People's Livelihood is the Principle of Making Money. If the people are to make money, the country will become rich along with it. I feel two points. First, the poverty of China is like water flowing eastward into the sea. The poverty of China flows from the countryside to the county, from the county to the province, to the big cities, and out to foreign countries. Therefore, if we want to make money, we must find a way to turn it back to the countryside. This is a major issue in saving China's poverty. The second point is a very small matter, regarding the government's personnel of financial administration personnel, which is not us, but the food service personnel and extortionists who extort the people. If these people are not eliminated, the people will not be able to do anything. Please pay attention to these two points, cultivate the vitality of the country, and make every citizen rich, richer every day, and richer in every place.

<h3>Closing Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi delivered a closing speech, saying that today is the closing ceremony of the National Finance Conference. The session lasted only seven days, but more than one hundred cases were resolved. All members traveled from afar, devoted themselves to their work, reviewed and discussed diligently, and determined various plans, so that those in charge of finance have a standard for implementation and reference. Xiangxi is in charge of the national financial administration and is deeply grateful. This Finance Conference can be expanded and enriched and can be called a national salvation conference. China is a country established on agriculture, but in recent years, the rural areas have gone bankrupt and the people's livelihood has been extremely desolate. Today, when we talk about saving the country, quelling banditry, and resisting foreign aggression, all of these are temporary solutions. Only by reviving the rural areas, developing industries, invigorating the people, and improving society can we fundamentally address the problems. The purpose of this conference is, in a negative sense, to alleviate the suffering of the people, and in a positive sense, to cultivate the wealth of the country. All of the fourteen items listed in the opening speech have proposals that have been discussed in detail. Among them, cases such as the reorganization of additional land taxes, the abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, and the determination of local budgets have been studied in particularly detail and have resulted in definite measures, which have been detailed in the conference declaration and need not be repeated. Now, I will briefly say a few words from my personal feelings, in the spirit of the farewell words of the ancients. Social public opinion often criticizes political gatherings for discussing but not deciding, and deciding but not acting. This conference should earnestly correct past mistakes and strive for practicality. For all resolutions, if the Ministry is requested to implement them, Xiangxi will accommodate them as much as possible and implement them according to their urgency. For those that belong to the local governments, such as the reduction of surcharges and the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes, I hope that the local financial authorities will earnestly implement them after returning to their posts. Regarding compensation, the Ministry will make appropriate arrangements for appropriation as soon as it verifies the facts. The development of tax sources that do not harm the people and the savings of non-urgent expenses are also expected to be vigorously implemented at the same time, so as to achieve the effect of balanced revenue and expenditure. The normalization of national finance depends on the establishment of budgets and final accounts. Although the central budget has been prepared for many years, the local budget is incomplete. The twenty-third year will begin in a blink of an eye. I deeply hope that the authorities of each province will urge each county to complete the entire national budget as soon as possible. If it can be established, it will be a permanent commemoration of this conference. The land declaration is an important plan that benefits the country and the people. The authorities of each local area should stipulate it as the standard for the performance evaluation of the authorities of each county. Xiangxi will submit a special report to the government for special praise and reward for those who can earnestly implement it and handle it quickly. Revolution must first 革心', the opening speech had mentioned it. The local financial authorities bear heavy responsibilities and serve as role models for their subordinates. It is hoped that they will not be afraid of doubts and slanders, not hindered by difficulties, implement gradually, and proceed in an orderly manner, taking mutual assistance and common maintenance as the way to promote progress, and 革污条染as the means to update. Uphold the meaning of relieving difficulties and being eager for public affairs, and use it as a plan to enrich wealth and increase taxes. If the whole country works together with one heart, it may be possible to relieve the country's difficulties and benefit the people's livelihood. Gentlemen, you love the country and are always willing to help. I hope that you will act immediately and work together. I also hope that you will strictly supervise your subordinates, so as to eliminate long-standing habits and establish a model of integrity and diligence. Xiangxi is incompetent and willing to encourage each other with you. Recently, the national situation is dangerous and the country is in ruins. People say that our country has no political organization and is a geographical term. It has almost no foothold in the international community. Thinking about the seriousness of the national crisis in the past two years, it is truly heartbreaking. However, the frequent foreign insults are actually caused by internal troubles. If internal troubles are not resolved, the levies will become more and more numerous. Our country now has the heaviest taxes and apportionments, with the provinces with more soldiers being the most affected. Recently, the soldiers in various provinces, feeling the danger of the national situation and the suffering of the people, have expressed remorse. A report said that a certain military commander in Sichuan Province gave a speech, and his remorse was overflowing with words, and he had a deep awareness. Those who hear it and rise up will not be few. Although this is only a matter in a corner of Sichuan Province, it can be regarded as a turning point in the future of the national situation. If we can all realize it, the national crisis will be easily eliminated, and it can also promote political clarity and bring finance into the right track. If all government affairs can be gradually promoted and the foundation of the country can be permanently consolidated. We are entrusted by the central government and bear the heavy responsibility of finance. At this time when people know to be vigilant, it is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We must work harder and overcome difficulties together, uphold the spirit of self-sacrifice, and adhere to the ancient teachings of being responsible for the rise and fall of the country, which is what I, Xiangxi, would like to encourage you all. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Thank-You Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Jingchun, Director of Finance of Ningxia, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all members, saying that today is the closing day of the Finance Conference. All the representatives are happy to hear Chairman Kong's various instructions and to receive various preferential treatments, and even more to receive Chairman Kong's words of encouragement. I am very grateful and I am publicly elected to deliver a reply. I and the other representatives were summoned to Beijing to attend the conference, and we were guided by Chairman Lin, President Wang, and President Dai, and we were encouraged by Chairman Chiang's distant telegram. The feeling of shame and gratitude cannot be expressed in words. In the past, meetings were often nothing more than empty talk. This time, I and the other attendees attended the conference for six or seven days and personally saw that the chairman and vice-chairman everywhere adopted an extremely sincere attitude, expressed various political views, and showed a love for the people like children. All internal and external proposals were reviewed and discussed, and no detail was spared. As a result, in an extremely short period of time, more than a hundred practical and feasible cases were resolved. The results were unprecedentedly good. From then on, the financial policy will have a certain goal, the suffering of farmers can be gradually alleviated, and the central government can provide care and assistance in terms of materials to the local governments. The idea of mutual support and unity also shows Chairman Kong's intention to seek perfection. At today's closing ceremony, President Wang and President Dai came in person to guide and encourage them sincerely. The representatives of the provinces and cities, after returning to their provinces and cities, will report to the competent authorities and will certainly, in accordance with the resolutions, follow Chairman Kong's painstaking efforts to maintain and rectify the internal and external cohesion, and proceed in order. In the future, Minister Kong will take the lead internally, and the authorities of each province and city will spread the policy externally. If the finances improve day by day, it must be based on this meeting. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Conference Declaration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Finance Conference held its final general meeting on the 27th and passed the Second National Finance Conference Declaration. The original text stated: The world economic panic has recently spread to our country, and years of natural and man-made disasters have come one after another. Famines are frequent, and all industries are declining. The most heartbreaking thing is that the cry for rural bankruptcy has almost accompanied the national crisis. The reason for this is not just one aspect, but the disasters of war and banditry, illegal taxes, and heavy collections, as well as various uneconomical expenditures, have all increased the burden on our people. Our country is based on agriculture, and farmers account for more than 80%. If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? Thinking about the future, we cannot help but shudder. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance, at the time of the Fourth Plenary Session, first proposed the reorganization of land taxes and the reduction of additional taxes. The central government is concerned about the suffering of the people and deeply considers the local situation, which varies greatly. Measures may conflict, so the Executive Yuan decided that the Ministry of Finance should convene a National Finance Conference on May 21 to discuss all financial issues. At the opening of the conference, representatives of the Central Party Department and the National Government attended the meeting and gave instructions. Chairman Lin and President Wang repeatedly gave instructions, and Chairman Chiang, even in the midst of military affairs, still sent telegrams to encourage us, earnestly instructing us to strengthen internal and external cohesion and strive to implement the plan for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Letters and telegrams from all parties expressed their expectations of this conference. After feeling encouraged, we felt that the responsibility was even greater. Now, fortunately, we have inherited something from ourselves and have a rough idea. The meeting lasted for seven days, and more than a hundred cases were resolved. We would like to extract the most important points to inform the people of the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that if the land problem is solved, the Principle of People's Livelihood can be solved. Therefore, the land problem is the center of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the prior reorganization of farmland is an imminent plan. This conference decided on several outlines for land declaration. For declaration procedures, we strive for simplicity. People who submit contracts will be inspected and returned immediately. For declaration costs, no fees will be charged. For those who do not understand the meaning of the declaration, we must provide detailed guidance in advance and not allow coercion. The land surveys and tax assessments that have been carried out effectively in various places can be done according to their own conditions. It was also decided to immediately request the government to issue a clear order, from the date of the closing of the conference, never to increase the surcharge on land tax again. All surcharges and taxes that were previously added must be reduced in stages, and the fundamental revision of tax laws and the thorough improvement of the collection system will be carried out. This is a way to reduce taxes and care for farmers that can be told to the people of the country. Harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies are the most disruptive to the people. This conference decided to abolish them separately, one by one, depending on the circumstances in each location, from July 23rd to the end of December 23rd. The classification of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies shall be strictly in accordance with Article 26 of the Provisional Constitution and Article 6 of the Provisional Law on Supervising Local Finances. This is the second measure to abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies that can be told to the people of the country. Business tax, broker tax, and deed tax are all major sources of income for local governments. Due to improper management over the years, tax revenue has sharply declined. At this time of declining industries and hardship for businesses, on the one hand, we will reorganize tax revenue, and on the other hand, we will take into account the difficulties of businesses. This conference decided on various regulations, which mostly take into account the actual situation of local governments and reform them gradually. The improvement of other tax systems and the standardization of collection systems were also formulated separately to facilitate implementation, and to gradually accumulate surplus funds for the development of industries and the management of construction. This is the third way to improve the tax system that can be told to the people of the country. The budget system is the key to taxation. Although the division of national taxes and local taxes was determined at the First National Finance Conference, the division of provincial taxes and county taxes is still lacking, which has led to the imbalance of revenue and expenditure between provinces and counties, and the local undertakings are difficult to develop. This conference decided that from now on, the standards for local revenue and expenditure of provinces and counties must be divided in detail, such as the previous example of the First National Finance Conference dividing national taxes and local taxes, and that unified collection and unified expenditure must be carried out in an orderly manner. This is the first example in our country that has rarely existed in the past, and it is especially beneficial to accounting and local undertakings. This is the fourth method of determining local budgets that can be told to the people of the country. In modern financial policies, there are thousands of ways, but they all boil down to two ways: increasing national income and developing the national economy. How to use the policy depends on the needs of the environment. If we look at the recent environment in our country, there is no other way to start than to focus on developing the national economy. Based on this principle, this conference decided to promote production, reward trade, and establish agricultural and industrial banks everywhere. The improvement of the monetary system and the cultivation of tax sources are all related to the development of the national economy. This conference also discussed them in detail and made plans. This is the fifth way to focus on production and construction that can be told to the people of the country. Preparing for local autonomy is the most urgent task at present. There are many undertakings to be carried out in various provinces, cities, and counties during this period. In the past, they relied on miscellaneous donations and taxes to make up for them, which cannot be enumerated. If we do not make proper plans for expenditure, it is not fair to simply cut and exempt taxes, and we are afraid of choking because of eating. This conference decided that, starting from next year, the stamp tax revenue of the central government will be used first as a preparation for subsidizing local governments, and the entire tax on tobacco and alcohol licenses will be allocated to local governments for collection. The judicial expenditure, which was originally borne by local governments, can also be borne by the central government as soon as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Judicial Administration have a plan. This is the sixth way to implement internal and external cohesion that can be told to the people of the country. In summary, all of the above are what our compatriots across the country expect from this conference. The key is not in saying more, but in the fact that this conference is determined to reflect on itself and take it as its own responsibility to achieve it in practice. In short, the relationship between the local government and the central government, and the people and the government, is closely related and cannot be ignored. Finance is not the finance of the central government alone, but the common finance of the entire country. The relaxation and tension of finance should be planned together with the entire country. The important mission of this conference is to gather the wisdom and strength of the people to jointly seek solutions. The key is to conform to the natural order of things, and the benefit is to adapt to changes in the times. From now on, I hope that our central and local authorities, as well as all the people, will rely on the resolutions made at this conference and implement them earnestly. In the future, among the various revenues, if there are any that involve harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies that disturb the people, they must be eradicated and clarified. If we can first remove the excessive ones, we can also give the people a small respite. Among the various expenditures, those that are useless or not urgent must be suspended, and those that are excessive or wasteful must be reduced and cut down. Saving money is no different from increasing revenue, and reducing expenses is no need to increase taxes. If we can reduce the burden on our people by one point, we will be invisibly nourishing the vitality of our people by one point. If we do not plan now, it will be too late. In addition, the utilization of resources and the enrichment of the people must rely on production, and the prosperity of society must cultivate the foundation. Finance is based on the market for circulation, and the market is based on the countryside as the source. How to use idle funds to save the decline of the countryside still depends on the efforts of the financial and monetary circles across the country. Finance is related to politics, military affairs, and other aspects. Since the success of the Northern Expedition, although the national military system has been gradually unified, there are still many troops scattered in various places that have not been formally trained, and long-standing habits have not been eliminated. They still need a lot of military pay, requisition agricultural products, and arbitrarily increase surcharges, which has not caused the prosperity of taxes and levies. Now, this conference has made a suggestion to the military authorities, asking them to strictly stop it. The local military leaders, who are entrusted with the defense of the country, will certainly agree with this idea and do their best to promote it. Having experienced the difficulties of the country and witnessing the suffering of the people, we have made various plans based on our conscience and during the shortest period of this conference, thinking to save the dangerous situation of the country by one in ten thousand. It is hoped that the people of the country will be of one heart and one mind, and jointly promote the governance of the country. We hereby declare. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Much Speculation About the Future of Sino-Japanese Negotiations; Authorities Still Say No Progress Has Been Made</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that with Ariyoshi's return to his country and Huang Fu's滞沪, there is much speculation about the situation between China and Japan. However, there has been no concrete progress on the matter. Recently, the movements of Yin Tong, coupled with Ariyoshi's departure for China, have created a sense that negotiations are nearing. The authorities still say that the time to proceed with a solution is still some distance away. That is because it has not yet been proven whether the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' instructions to Ariyoshi and the policies Ariyoshi brought with him have reversed the previous threatening attitude. According to transportation industry sources, it is rumored that the postal communication issue will be carried out based on the three principles decided by the League of Nations, but the Ministry of Communications still says that it has not considered it yet and has not made any progress.

<h3>Beijing Citizens' Poisoning Case; Salt Office Believes There is No Poisonous Substance in the Salt</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Salt Affairs Office previously investigated the poisoning of residents in Hanximen, Beijing, due to eating salt, and sent Technologist Ye Yu to conduct an on-site investigation. It was believed that there was no poisonous substance in the salt, and it was still doubtful whether the disease was caused by salt. The office said that the table salt in Beijing was sold by the Yihexiang Salt Shop. After the incident, it also sent personnel to collect salt samples from Yihexiang Salt Shop together with the Health Office for chemical inspection. The results of the chemical inspection showed that no sodium nitrite was found. As for the salt sold in Fudelong and other shops, if it was indeed mixed with sodium nitrite, whether it had another source or was caused by improper storage, the Salt Affairs Office has ordered Huainan Transport Deputy to thoroughly investigate and strictly crack down on it.

<h3>Promoting National Physical Education</h3>
<p>A Western philosopher once said, "In the struggle for existence, the fittest survive." This is a timeless and irrefutable truth. Our Chinese nation, facing an extraordinary crisis, has reached the stage of a final struggle. Fitness or unfitness will be determined now. However, most of our people, burdened by accumulated weakness, are spiritually listless and physically declining. Corrupt habits and unhealthy customs heavily erode and surround us, leading to a decline in vitality and the burial of conscience, to the point where we are unaware of our own value, let alone that of the nation. This phenomenon is already widespread, and the backwardness of physical education is inevitably one of its reflections. The disaster of natural selection will be unavoidable if things continue. We must give this deep thought.</p>
<p>The promotion of physical education in our country began, upon investigation, in the 23rd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty (1897).</p>
<p>At that time, after the Sino-Japanese War, insightful people deeply understood that the spirit of national salvation resided in a strong body. Therefore, they began to pay attention to physical education. However, schools, clinging to the idea of using martial arts to save the country, only emphasized mechanical military drills. Beyond this, there was no so-called physical education. Later, with the promotion of missionary schools, it progressed from a single-track system of exclusive gymnastics to a dual-track system that emphasized both gymnastics and sports. This can be considered a major step forward. Unfortunately, in recent years, the scope of physical education activities has been limited to a few schools, and the sports community nationwide has been completely dominated by students. Physical education has failed to integrate with the general public, leading to a deformed development. Aside from nurturing a few athletes to be objects of praise for those who worship heroes, it not only fails to have a positive impact on the nation and society, but even indirectly encourages personal vanity and triggers brawls and fights on the sports field. Some say that the period from the revolution and Northern Expedition to the present is a dangerous time for physical education in our country. This is certainly no exaggeration.</p>
<p>To correct this, we must provide all citizens with opportunities for full and balanced development. The government authorities have long been aware of this. For example, the establishment of the National Physical Education Guidance Committee in the 16th year of the Republic, the drafting of the National Physical Education Law in the 18th year of the Republic, the convening of the National Physical Education Conference in the 21st year of the Republic, and the promulgation of the National Physical Education Implementation Plan, all aimed at promoting national health and reviving the national spirit. However, the concrete achievements of the physical education community, apart from a few sports meets represented by the academic community, have been few and far between. Even with sports meets, the World Games have been held ten times since their inception. Our country only sent one representative to participate in the last session. As for the hope of scoring points, it is still unknown when that will happen. Since the Far Eastern Games began, our country only won the championship once, in the second session (1915). After that, it fell into a slump. The performance in track and field events has deteriorated since the fourth session (1919), further discouraging people. The key is not the skill level of the athletes, but the low level of physical education among the general public. This is commonly recognized by those in the know. Therefore, those responsible for promoting physical education should know how to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>When it comes to the way to remedy the situation, there is no need to aim too high or too far. Simply select and implement the key points from the plans and programs already announced by the government, and the effect will be immeasurable. The principles and outlines are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For the general public: Actively promote amateur sports. Each county should establish at least one public sports ground in the county seat, gradually extending to cities, towns, and villages. Amateur sports meets should be held once or twice each year in spring (April to June) or autumn (September to November). However, local customs vary from place to place. Whether farmers have spare time to engage in physical education and what kind of materials are most appropriate should be carefully studied before a decision is made. Traditional group activities in our country's various rural areas, such as the "Double Stone Association" in the north and dragon boat races in the south, and individual activities such as kicking shuttlecock and lifting stone locks, as well as rural games such as hide-and-seek and finger pointing games, each have physical education value and can be improved by applying scientific methods and educational principles. For urban residents, hiking, hunting, picnics, and long-distance travel should be promoted at all times.</p>
<p>(2) For schools: The purpose of physical education should not be to train athletes, but to promote universal physical activity among all students. In specialized schools and above, physical education courses should be two hours per week. Students who fail will not be allowed to advance or graduate. Primary and secondary schools and normal schools should follow the Ministry of Education's provisional curriculum standards. Students who fail will also not be allowed to advance or graduate. The physical education performance of each school will be evaluated by the central and local education authorities.</p>
<p>Governing lies not in many words, but in practical implementation. Physical education is related to the survival of the entire nation and should not be approached with perfunctory or superficial means. We dare to wait and see the completion of the above two major goals.</p>
<h3>Naval Preparatory Conference: Japan Opposes Involving Far Eastern Politics; Five Conditions for Participation Determined; Insists on Equality and Overthrowing Ratios; Strong Stance with Threat of Withdrawal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to formally decide within days to participate in the preliminary arms reduction talks centered on London. Before formally replying to Britain, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has considered negotiation strategies, namely, that the Far East issue should not be mentioned during the preliminary talks, such as whether the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo violates the Nine-Power Treaty. This issue must not be discussed. Also, the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated on April 17 that Japan is solely responsible for maintaining peace in East Asia. Japan believes that this is a very legitimate statement, so this matter should not be discussed either. In order to make the foreign diplomatic envoys understand this matter, Foreign Minister Hirota issued the following telegrams of instruction to major ambassadors such as Matsudaira in the UK and Saito in the US yesterday:</p>
<p>The 1935 naval arms reduction conference is convened in accordance with the provisions of the London Treaty and should be a purely naval force conference. Therefore, in addition to this force, if various issues in East Asia are discussed as agenda items, it would undermine the original nature of this conference. The Japanese government cannot recognize this. If someone makes unreasonable demands and proposes such issues at the preparatory meeting as part of the agenda, Japan will withdraw from the arms reduction conference, and that is not to be avoided. (United China Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the start of preparatory negotiations for the naval arms reduction conference, the five major principles advocated by the Japanese government after Foreign Minister Hirota's proposed conditions for participation were approved by the Cabinet Council on the 29th are as follows: (1) The principle of equal rights in armaments is established, that is, the national defense forces and armaments of a country must be determined in accordance with national conditions, and their quantity cannot be restricted by other countries. (2) Re-examination of the ratio system, that is, the ratio system in fact only causes one or two countries to expand their military forces in terms of quantity. Therefore, the empire advocates not relying on ratios and believes that there is a need to strive to discover new arms reduction methods. (3) Local special agreements, that is, in order to adapt to the geographical location of each country and the special circumstances of neighboring countries, and the special performance of various ships, in addition to quantitative restrictions by ship type, countries with closely related interests must set quantitative restrictions on Type B cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Local special agreements are required. Therefore, world naval powers must be divided into the Pacific Group, the Atlantic Group, the European Group, and the South American Group. In addition to general agreements, special agreements should be set up. (4) Complete abolition of offensive warships, that is, the principle of national defense lies in being insufficient in offense and more than sufficient in defense. Japan believes that it is necessary to completely abolish aircraft carriers that threaten non-combatants. (5) Expanding the Pacific defense restriction area will not lead to a crisis of war, and adding military bases will only provoke suspicion among countries and cause disputes. Therefore, it is necessary to disarm the Pacific within a possible range. It is hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States will recognize that Hawaii, the Philippines, Singapore, etc. are also included in the defense restriction area. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy Ministry decided on June 1 to appoint Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the First Air Squadron, to serve in the Military Affairs Department concurrently with the Navy Ministry. Rear Admiral Hideho Wada, commander of the Kasumigaura Air Corps, will be appointed as his successor. Rear Admiral Yamamoto has experience attending the London Conference and will be appointed as the chief attendant of the next arms reduction conference. He will now specialize in studying arms reduction countermeasures and will be appointed as a member of the Arms Reduction Preparatory Committee within days. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>US Statement of Position: Willing to Participate in London Talks; Advocates General Compromise</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated that the US government does not intend to conduct preliminary talks with relevant countries in Washington to discuss the agenda, date, and location of the 1935 naval conference. Hull also said that the London talks proposed by Britain are sufficient to simplify the issue. In his view, there is no need to divide it into two talks. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito took the initiative to visit Secretary of State Hull. During the talks, Hull informed him that the United States is preparing to hold bilateral talks in London to prepare for next year's naval conference. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Min Sheng Lun Tan Bao reported that regarding the preparation for the naval conference, Britain and the United States on one side and Japan and Britain on the other will hold separate talks in London. However, when Secretary of State Hull met with Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito yesterday, it was agreed that when the two countries talked with a third country, they must inform each other of any agreement reached on the issue of naval restrictions. The reason for this is to avoid the unexpected events of the 1930 London Conference. Although the United Kingdom and the United States had previously agreed in advance in 1930, difficulties ultimately arose between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, which led to the suspension of general discussions, and only a partial compromise was reached. This time, such accidents should not be allowed to happen again. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>France Accepts British Invitation: Particularly Concerned About German Naval Expansion; Security Guarantees Cannot Be Conceded</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government has accepted the British government's invitation and decided to participate in the naval preparatory meeting between the four signatory countries of the 1922 Washington Convention. According to today's news, the talks will be of a dual nature and will be conducted through ordinary diplomatic channels. It is heard that the French government attaches great importance to this preliminary negotiation. The discussion will not only involve procedural issues, but also the basic points of the difficult naval restriction issues will be discussed. According to the French Debates, the French government must participate in this very complicated negotiation in the best possible conditions within the possible range. France's lack of preparation and acceptance of unsatisfactory conditions at the Washington Conference in 1922 should serve as a warning. Furthermore, the German navy was not discussed in 1922, but now the situation has changed and there may be surprising developments. The French Radical Party newspaper stated that France has reached the limit of arms reduction. Without new security guarantees, it cannot retreat any further. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Important Expression of Italian Premier: Continues to Allocate Huge Sums to Expand Armaments; Absolutely Does Not Believe in Permanent Peace</h3>
<p>Italy has decided to continue allocating huge sums for naval and air force expenditures. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made an important speech in the House of Representatives today before the summer recess, stating that the Italian government will allocate special funds of 1 billion lire each to the navy and air force, to be allocated in six months, for renewal purposes. The world's recovery largely depends on political issues, namely the situations in the Saar, the Danube, and the Far East, and arms reduction events. Mussolini continued, "I absolutely do not believe in permanent peace. People's fundamental abilities can only be manifested in the sunlight through struggle. If there is permanent peace, it will destroy people's fundamental abilities, which is the opposite." (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Demands Huge Budget</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A major issue in the Showa 9 budget is the cost of improving armaments based on the supplementary naval plan. In the Showa 10 budget, major parts such as the construction of auxiliary vessels and the addition of air squadrons will continue to be recorded. Moreover, the crisis of 1935 and 1936 is imminent, and the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, causing the naval budget to become an important issue again. Therefore, there will definitely be huge new demands in the 10th year. In particular, due to the accident of the torpedo boat Tomozuru, increasing the buoyancy of ships is absolutely necessary for the navy. Therefore, the increase in remodeling costs in the 10th year will inevitably be quite large. The Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has also foreseen this and is studying countermeasures. That is, the Navy Ministry intends to modify the four torpedo boats already built and the ships under 5,000 tons belonging to the second supplementary plan, as well as the completed capital ships and cruisers, in order to increase the buoyancy. Therefore, the amount of its expenditure must be shockingly undoubtedly. Therefore, the negotiations between the Navy Ministry and the Ministry of Finance will inevitably be a major issue in the formation of the 10th year budget. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy Department stated that the Japanese naval air power is weaker than that of Britain and the United States and cannot defeat Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is determined to train 1,500 aviation personnel in three years from 1934 to 1936 and build new seaplane aircraft carriers and three 10,000-ton mother ships, which are scheduled to be completed in mid-1936. (United China Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Reorganizes: Hishikari Transferred to Military Councillor; There Is a Theory That Minami Jiro Will Succeed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The regular personnel changes in the army in August, under the chairmanship of Army Minister Hayashi, have recently begun to be evaluated. This personnel change is sufficient to show Army Minister Hayashi's determination to refresh the department and his countermeasures against the crisis in 1936, which is worthy of attention. The main expected personnel changes are: General Takashi Hishikari, commander of the Kwantung Army, will return to the military councillor, and his successor will be Chief Military Councillor General Jiro Minami. Vice Minister of the Army Lieutenant General Heisuke Yanagawa will be transferred to commander of the division, and his successor may be First Section Chief of the General Staff Headquarters Lieutenant General Mikizo Koso, Lieutenant General Mitsuji Tatekawa attached to the 10th Division Command, Army University President Lieutenant General Takeshi Hirose, Chief of General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters Lieutenant General Toranosuke Hashimoto, etc. Commander of the Korean Army Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Kawashima will be appointed as a military councillor, and his successor may be Vice Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Kenkichi Ueda and Fourth Division Commander Lieutenant General Juichi Terauchi. Commander of the Taiwan Army General Iwane Matsui will return to the military councillor, and his successor may be Vice Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Kenkichi Ueda and Fourth Division Commander Lieutenant General Juichi Terauchi.

<h3>Japanese Naval Elder Togo Seriously Ill: Participated in the Russo-Japanese War; Naval Battle Memorial Greatly Diminished</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the whole country is celebrating the 29th anniversary of the naval battle of the Tsushima Strait, but the news that Elder Admiral Togo, who established special achievements on that day, is seriously ill has greatly diminished the celebration. According to reports, Togo has been suffering from illness since last summer and has been confined to bed for a long time. Recently, he has developed pharyngitis and his condition has worsened. He is already eighty-six years old, so everyone is extremely worried about him. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Yilan Righteous Army Shoots Down Three Japanese Aircraft: Lacking Ammunition and Awaiting Urgent Assistance</h3>
<p>(Changchun) According to Kwantung Army news, the Yilan Righteous Army has shot down three Japanese aircraft and seized dozens of machine guns and artillery since resisting Japan. However, after the Pu and Wakayama units were transferred from Japan, large teams and pseudo-soldiers were mobilized to attack the Righteous Army. Although the power of the Righteous Army is still vast, they are severely lacking ammunition and are urgently awaiting assistance from the Righteous Army in the eastern border of Jidong.

<h3>The Arms Reduction Final Struggle and Watch the Results of the General Committee Meeting: Russia Drafts New Plan Based on European Cooperation; Small Countries in North-Central Europe Mainly Maintain the Status Quo of Armaments; Britain Attempts to Exert All Efforts to Promote Air Force Convention</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The arms reduction conference is scheduled to open on the 29th. Recent developments have led to hopes that the work will continue in the old outline, but the purpose is not as far-reaching as before. The first development is that Soviet Russia is currently drafting a plan, and France has agreed to support it. The plan is based on European cooperation, stipulates the definition of aggressor countries, and sanctions against violators. It is heard that the plan is extremely flexible. If a general treaty cannot be concluded, regional treaties can still be concluded. The second development is the plan proposed by the delegations of the three Scandinavian countries and Switzerland and Spain, which advocates that the armaments of each country be limited to the current level. In the future, it will be agreed to suspend armaments for several years, which is a great progress compared to the Italian proposal. Many opinions believe that US observer to the arms reduction conference Davis, under the special instructions of President Roosevelt, will advocate concluding a specific treaty to supervise armaments, but Japan may oppose this proposal. The third development is that Britain is trying to save the air force convention from failure. It is heard that British Foreign Minister Simon does not want to put forward any substantive suggestions on this matter, but the British delegation will enthusiastically support any initiative related to this.

<h3>Representatives from Various Countries Head to Geneva</h3>
<p>French Minister Lebrun and British Foreign Minister Simon set off from London by plane to Geneva to attend the meeting of the Arms Reduction Conference General Committee and arrived here at 11:20 this morning. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister of Warsaw, has already left here for Geneva to attend the meeting of the Arms Reduction Conference General Committee on Tuesday. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Davis and Barthou Hold Earnest Talks</h3>
<p>(Paris) Davis and Barthou had a long talk in Paris this afternoon, both advocating for making every effort to keep the arms reduction conference alive and to restore its health. The two discussed various procedures and methods regarding this, but no decisions were made. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) When Foreign Minister Barthou met with US Arms Reduction Representative Davis, they considered the work procedures of the Arms Reduction General Committee on May 29 and studied various solutions. After discussion, it seems that the General Committee cannot continue to work, because the task entrusted to the committee by the League of Nations Council is to "reduce and limit armaments." However, the General Committee currently has only two draft arms reduction conventions, namely the British and Italian memoranda. However, both memoranda agree to allow Germany to expand its armaments, which seems to be outside the task assigned to the General Committee by the Council. In this situation, Arms Reduction Conference Chairman Henderson may have to explain to the League of Nations Council that the General Committee cannot complete its organizational tasks. Faced with this, the Council may either organize a new committee, assign it new tasks, and allow the United States and Russia to join, or advise the relevant countries to engage in bilateral negotiations again on a new basis. In short, to this day, the most reasonable way to establish a convention is for the General Committee to return its task to the League of Nations Council. If the purpose of the arms reduction conference needs to be changed or new methods adopted, it can be decided by the Council. However, this is only a speculation, neither does France have this intention, nor can it be regarded as France has this suggestion. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Will Issue Declaration on Joining the League of Nations: France Denies Concluding Military Agreement with Russia</h3>
<p>(Paris) Chen Bao received news from London that, according to informed sources in Soviet Russia, Stalin may issue a declaration on the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations in the near future. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign newspapers have repeatedly declared that France and Soviet Russia have concluded a military agreement. Responsible parties here have recently formally denied this statement. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Ship Invades Russian Territory: Russia Lodges Verbal Protest</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Slazki, visited the local pseudo-Foreign Ministry official, Shimomura, on the 26th and lodged a verbal protest, saying that on the 12th, a Manchurian ship invaded Soviet territory downstream of Pichen, Yalu River, without warning. This was within the military security area. At that time, the ship did not obey the Soviet army's order to stop. The Soviet army then fired warning shots into the sky. This clearly infringes on territorial rights. The Manchurian side protested that there were deaths as a result, and requested that evidence be shown. Official Shimomura replied that the Manchurian ship was traveling according to the navigation chart and had no obligation to obey the order to stop. Therefore, it was illegally tied up, and one "Manchukuo" person died and one was seriously injured. Shells were immediately shown and regret was expressed for the Soviet Union's actions.

<h3>The Situation at Yuguan Becomes Tense Again: A Trainload of Japanese Soldiers Arrives from Jinzhou; Small Numbers of Troops Patrol the War Zone, Picking Quarrels with Local Militias; Negotiations Regarding the Takeover of Malan峪 Stalled</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, a trainload of Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived at Yuguan from Jinzhou. They did not disembark, seemingly awaiting further orders. Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, and Su Yuqi, the chief of public security, have telegraphed Tao Shangming and Yu Xuezhong to report the situation. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese garrison troops stationed in Pingjin, Qinhuangdao, Yuguan, will be</p>
<p>completely rotated next month. Yesterday, a train arrived carrying Japanese troops for the rotation. The Japanese troops being rotated from Yuguan to Pingjin are two companies from the First Regiment, scheduled to arrive in mid-next month. The advance team arrived in Pingjin yesterday. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is very active in demanding the resumption of traffic. Issues such as the rotation and takeover of new and old security teams in the war zone and the withdrawal of the puppet police at the northern entrance of Malan峪 can only proceed after the traffic issue is resolved. Currently, various negotiations have been affected by the traffic issue and are temporarily stalled. Regarding the incident of Japanese troops in Luan County groundlessly arresting members of the local defense corps, the Hebei provincial government has telegraphed Tao Shangming to negotiate with the Japanese Captain Asami stationed in Tangshan. Tao sent Secretary Lin as his representative to Luan County yesterday to negotiate, demanding that the Japanese troops first release the arrested corps members. There are currently over twenty garrison troops in Luan County protecting river transport and forty officers and soldiers. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A few days ago, Japanese troops in Luan County conducted field exercises without notifying our local government beforehand. Furthermore, the exercise area targeted villages and settlements with live ammunition, causing a misunderstanding by the local defense corps, who fired warning shots into the air. The Japanese side, however, used this as an excuse, claiming there was an anti-Japanese atmosphere in the area, and arrested three defense corps members, torturing them severely. At the same time, they protested to the Luan County government, demanding the handover of those responsible for the defense corps. Tao Shangming is going to Luan County today to investigate the matter and then negotiate with the Japanese side. It is said that two of the three corps members arrested by the Japanese have died tragically under torture, and the other is seriously injured and in critical condition. Yin Rugeng is scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow night to meet with Yu to seek instructions on unresolved issues in the war zone. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming plans to go to Lengkou, Yiyuan Kou, and Tangjiakou to inspect the situation of the puppet state's customs collecting heavy taxes on our goods. He also plans to increase the number of police stations at various ports. On the 26th, he left Funing for Lulong, where he inspected the county before proceeding onwards. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The provincial authorities have not yet received reports on the alleged increase of Japanese troops in Yuguan. According to a certain important person, Japanese troops are constantly moving between Yuguan and Luan County. On the 26th, a Japanese officer stationed in Luan County told the Luan County magistrate that the three arrested members of the defense corps would only be released after an investigation into whether they were engaged in anti-Manchu, anti-Japanese activities or plotting to harm the Japanese army. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the express train from Pingyu arrived in Beiping this afternoon, more than sixty Japanese military officers with the ranks of major and lieutenant colonel arrived in Beiping. After disembarking, they immediately went to the Japanese barracks to report. It is said that they boarded the train separately from Yuguan, Tangshan, and Tianjin. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side is still creating difficulties regarding the issue of Hebei Province continuing to recruit 8,000 special police officers to enter the war zone, making it difficult to resolve the issue for the time being. Yin Rugeng is scheduled to come to Tianjin from Beiping on the 28th to meet with Chairman Yu to discuss negotiation methods. The handover of Malan峪 and the withdrawal of the puppet police from Nantianmen has now stalled again. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to reports from a certain source, Japanese troops have increased at various ports along the border. They are conducting combat exercises from time to time and small numbers of troops are entering our war zone to patrol, forbidding merchants from closing their doors, punishing them severely if they do so, or entering to conduct inspections, and picking quarrels with local civilian defense corps and other groups. Three members of our civilian defense corps in Luanzhou have been arrested by the Japanese army and have not yet been released. The situation in Shanhaiguan is suddenly more tense than before. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, the Japanese side has repeatedly created pretexts in the war zone to demonstrate force against us and force us to yield. The Jixian incident a few days ago was a pre-planned scheme. On the 25th, Japanese troops in Luan County suddenly falsely accused our civilian defense corps of provocation, opened fire on them, arrested and tortured them, and made unreasonable demands on the Luan County government. After our investigation, it was purely a misunderstanding, just like the Jixian incident. According to reports on the 27th, the Japanese garrison in Yuguan has increased by another two hundred-odd men. Their intentions are obvious. This matter is currently being negotiated by Tao Shangming and the director of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Yuguan, Iga. A resolution should be reached within days. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone call from Zunhua, Shimen Town in Zunhua County is a thoroughfare to Malan峪. Japanese troops come and go from time to time. In recent days, Japanese planes have been flying over the town for reconnaissance. Their intentions are unclear, but the merchants and residents, being accustomed to this, are quite calm.

<h3>After Reorganization, a Small Unit of Yang Hou's Troops Suddenly Mutinies; Song Zheyuan Plans Methods of Disposal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The small unit of Yang Hou's troops, having been confirmed by the Chahar provincial government after reorganization, was</p>
<p>organized into an independent cavalry regiment, temporarily stationed between Baochang and Kangbao. However, Yang's subordinates, being difficult to tame due to their bandit-like nature, suddenly had a unit mutiny yesterday, attempting to flee towards Dolon. The Chahar provincial government telegraphed Song Zheyuan to report this last night and this morning. This morning, Song summoned Qin Dechun and Yao Jingchuan, the Baochang garrison commander, to his private residence in the Wuyi Ku to discuss methods of disposal. In addition to telegraphing the Chahar army units of Feng Zhian and Zhao Dengyu to guard against and monitor the remaining units, he immediately ordered Yao Jingchuan to return to his post as soon as possible. After receiving the order, Yao returned to Zhangjiakou this afternoon and then returned to Baochang to defend his post. The funds for the reorganization of Yang's unit have not yet been claimed. Song is in Beiping receiving medical treatment for his back problems and has recently suffered from a serious internal ailment. If the Yang unit incident becomes serious, Song will return to Chahar despite his illness in the short term. However, the escapees are only a small unit, so there is no major problem.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Tianjin Form Organizations to Obstruct Customs Inspections of Japanese Ships; They Photograph Chinese Customs Officials and Insult Them at Will; The British Deputy Customs Commissioner, Fearing Their Power, Dares Not Negotiate</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the afternoon of the 26th, many Japanese youths from Tianjin, each wearing badges with the words "China Youth Federation" on their lapels and concealing seven-shot handguns, went to the pier in Special District One to prevent Tianjin Customs officials from inspecting the Japanese ship Chōhei Maru arriving from Tanggu. The British Deputy Customs Commissioner, fearing the power of the Japanese, did not dare to negotiate directly. The Japanese took photographs of the Chinese Customs officials and insulted them at will. Similar incidents occurred once before on the afternoon of the 24th. It is reported that the Tianjin Customs Commissioner has telegraphed the Central Government for instructions. Customs officials are wary while on duty and dare not perform official duties on Japanese ships entering the port. The China Youth Federation, organized by Japanese residents, is located on Furong Street in the Japanese Concession. It was established in March of this year, with Tanaka, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Tianjin, as its head. It is believed that the reason for obstructing our customs inspection is to prevent us from finding smuggled mail and military supplies for a certain traitor faction, as well as the transport of Chinese laborers abroad. The recent assassination of Wu Yueqi, a customs assistant in Tianjin Customs, is largely related to this matter. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Discusses Measures for the Resumption of Traffic between Beiping and Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Yanagida said that the plan for the resumption of traffic includes establishing a neutral agency jointly organized by China and Japan between the Beiping-Liaoning and South Manchurian Railways. The name of this agency is the International Travel Agency, or the Beiping-Fengtian Transportation Company. A head office will be set up in Yuguan, and three branch offices will be set up in Fengtian, Tianjin, and Beiping. Internal staff will be organized by personnel from the Beiping-Liaoning and South Manchurian Railways. In terms of rolling stock, four trains will be prepared, with locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars provided by the South Manchurian Railway. South Manchurian Railways will be responsible for the staff on the trains, including drivers, conductors, and railway police, who are in the Guandong region. Staff from both sides will take over in Yuguan. Trains will run between Beiping and Shenyang once a day in both directions. Profits or losses from business will be shared or borne jointly by China and Japan. All of these are technical issues. (27th Dispatch)</p>

Now, with the Bailing Temple fair approaching, the committee's current borrowed headquarters must be vacated and a new one built, which will require over 90,000 yuan. The committee has telegraphed the Central Government to allocate the funds. Toktoh plans to visit Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi after the funding is settled. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

According to a batch of surrendered bandits, including the commander of the puppet Pingyi Independent Battalion and a puppet guerrilla captain, the reasons for becoming bandits were: first, they lived in bandit-controlled areas and were forced to join; second, they were unemployed and had no way to survive, so they took the risk; third, local bullies forced them to risk their lives. They had thought that joining the bandits would lead to a way out, but the opposite was true. They had never heard of what communism was.

<h3>Political Turmoil Erupts in Romania; The Future Prime Minister Is Bereft of His Wife; Formation of the Cabinet Is Delayed As A Result</h3>
<p>(Bucharest) Political turmoil in Romania seems to have formally erupted today and may be resolved in the middle of next week. Prime Minister Tatarescu is currently experiencing serious difficulties. Tatarescu requested the king to dismiss General Averescu, the leader of the People's Party, but was refused by the king. Therefore, the Prime Minister believes that the King no longer trusts him. Currently, there is a strong outcry for General Averescu to be appointed as Prime Minister to organize a new cabinet with national unity. If necessary, Bratianu, the leader of the split faction of the Liberal Party, and the current Minister of Education, Anghelescu, will also join. According to Adeverul newspaper, the government will issue a substitute legal order to pass the budget and engage in administrative and electoral system reforms, and will conduct legislative elections based on both approval orders and constitutional amendments. (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>

There will be no development until at least Tuesday. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germans Indignant at Comments by French Foreign Minister, Austrians Sympathetic</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have harshly criticized French Foreign Minister Barthou's speech to the Chamber of Deputies yesterday.

Deutsche Zeitung, the official organ of the Labor Front, said that Germany would issue an official declaration on the Saar issue in response to Barthou's speech. The newspaper said: "Germany will declare its readiness to provide the people of Saar with all guarantees so that they can vote freely. As for the League of Nations, if it wants to prove that it is not an absolutely useless organization, it should set May 31 next year as the date for the Saar vote." (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US House Committee Approves Government Silver Bill; Silver Price Increases Should Be Gradual; Otherwise, China Will Be the First to Suffer</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House Committee on Rules submitted a report approving the government silver bill. Chairman Dye said that he intends to submit this bill to the House next week. Congressman Titus appeared before the Committee on Rules today, requesting immediate passage of the government's silver bill, saying that this bill only seeks to restore the silver reserve to its proper ratio to the gold reserve and is not an inflationary bill. Credit borrowing now has the potential to inflate to US$75 million because the Federal Reserve Banks' reserves have increased sharply. Dye advocated a 50% silver profit tax, saying that this tax would prevent speculators from profiting at the expense of taxpayers. The Treasury should not be forced to purchase a fixed amount of silver each month. Dye went on to say that the increase in the price of silver should be gradual, otherwise the United States will be controlled by speculators and the results must be adjusted. China will especially suffer as a result. President Roosevelt and his administrative advisors have clearly succeeded in obstructing the passage of other silver bills by the current parliament. The President and his advisors have proposed a silver compromise bill, saying that this bill includes all the monetary policies they have agreed to. In other words, they do not want to support other silver bills. (26th Guomin Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Sends Notes to Various Countries Demanding Repayment of War Debts Due; Roosevelt to Send Message to Congress Requesting Permission to Use Silver to Pay Debts</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the State Department sent a war debt note for debts due on June 15 to France and Belgium. War debt notes for other debtor countries will also be sent out in two or three days. Diplomats are waiting for a special message on war debts to be sent to Congress. According to recent statements from the White House, President Roosevelt will issue this message soon. Everything regarding the war debt issue is now unsettled, as several changes have occurred since the last war debt was due in December. The passage of the Johnson Act has not been enough to change France's attitude, but there may be some reaction in the UK regardless. It is understood that if credit payments cannot eliminate the bad name of the defaulting countries, the UK may not be willing to continue this payment method. It is still questionable whether the silver bill recently introduced in Congress will have a significant impact on the war debt situation. However, President Roosevelt already has the power to purchase silver on the world market, freely set the price of silver, and accept debt payments from debtor countries in silver.

<h3>US Highway Construction Plan Could Promote US-Central American Commercial Development</h3>
<p>(Washington) A report has been prepared after three years of research on highways and submitted to the House of Representatives, proposing that the United States build a highway directly to Panama. If this happens, all the republics of Central America will have the opportunity to develop their trade and work with the United States for commercial prosperity. The United States can also promote its economic development, as the transportation of cars can directly reach various places. If Central American countries such as coffee, cocoa, and banana producing countries can communicate with each other, gold, silver, copper, and various mineral products can also circulate among them. The House Highways Committee is now planning to go for inspection before deciding on future actions. The proposal to establish the Pan American Highway Affairs Bureau is now awaiting the decision of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This will likely lead to an international organization managed by the Pan American Union. (26th Guomin Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Heroic Feat of a French Aviator: Crossing the Atlantic in a Non-Stop Flight Across the New Continent</h3>
<p>Renowned aviators Costes and Bellonte of Le Bourget, France, this morning conducted the final test flight of their monoplane "Joseph Le Brix." They departed today from this location, attempting to cross the Atlantic and traverse the American continent to reach San Diego, California. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Marseilles: At 11:45 AM today (Greenwich time), the "Joseph Le Brix" aircraft sent a wireless message stating, "We have now flown a distance of 1,430 kilometers and reached the intersection of 45 degrees 15 minutes north latitude and 16 degrees 35 minutes west longitude. We are in excellent spirits. Good morning to our friends." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Costes and Bellonte previously departed from New York last year, flying across the North Atlantic and directly reaching Rayak, Syria, in Asia, a distance of 9,150 kilometers, setting a world record. This time, they aim to extend the record to over 10,000 kilometers. Originally scheduled to depart no later than June 15th, they suddenly decided to leave earlier last night. Costes and Bellonte had initially planned three routes: (1) From France across the Atlantic to San Francisco in North America; (2) Flying across the South Atlantic to Porto Maia in Brazil; (3) Directly from Paris to Tokyo. (Considering the climate, the first two routes were preferable before June 10th, while the third route would be more suitable after June 10th.) If the third route were chosen, according to flight techniques, it would have to detour through Arkhangelsk in northern Russia, rather than taking a direct eastward path, making it more difficult. According to yesterday's weather report, the weather in the North Atlantic was quite favorable, so they decided to fly to North America.</p>

Now, according to an order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the route is being resurveyed on the northern bank of the Xin River. Hou Jiayuan led engineers and others to Yushan to investigate and study the terrain and give instructions for construction. They returned to the province yesterday. However, because there are still scattered bandits appearing along the line, the Military Commission has been requested to send teams to protect the work of the engineering personnel. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The survey of the Yu-Ping Railway will be completed before June 20th, and bidding for the earthwork project will begin immediately.

<h3>Japan's New Policy of Aggression Against China: Threatening and Inducing Both the Government and the People, Forcibly Preventing Foreign Powers from Aiding China</h3>
<p>Beiping correspondence: Japan's aggression against China is premeditated and never-ending. Its aggressive policies change from time to time depending on changes in the international situation and the internal situation in China. According to someone who recently arrived in Beiping from Dalian, Japan's recent policy of aggression against China is a step further than before, with a more vicious intention and a more comprehensive plan, roughly as follows: (1) Exerting extreme pressure on the Chinese government to make it succumb, hoping to enter into formal or informal direct negotiations, so that its illegal acts of armed occupation and all outstanding issues can be adequately guaranteed and resolved favorably. (2) Using goodwill as a banner, Japan is making every effort to win over people from all walks of life in China, using literati to interact with Chinese literati, and using soldiers to entice Chinese officers, in order to reduce the anti-Japanese sentiment of people from all walks of life in China and gradually anesthetize them. (3) Vigorously seeking Sino-Japanese economic, technological, and aviation cooperation, implementing economic and technological aggression, with the aim of controlling China's lifeline outside of military force. (4) If the above three conspiracies fail, Japan will still adopt a policy of military aggression, sending troops to directly seize Chahar and Suiyuan on the one hand, and looking for puppets in North China on the other hand, creating the so-called North China State, causing internal divisions in China. Japan has long harbored a conspiracy against Chahar, because Japan is actively preparing for a world war, and its main strong enemies are only the United States and Russia. The increasingly dangerous situation between Japan and Russia will eventually lead to a war, which is generally expected. Japan has a firm grasp on naval power against Russia. The only concern is land warfare. In recent years, Japan has made considerable arrangements in the Northeast. The defenses in that area are relatively consolidated. The western line of defense is at risk of being attacked due to Outer Mongolia being in the hands of Russia. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the western line. Chahar is located at the crossroads of Outer Mongolia into Rehe and is extremely important. Therefore, Japan must obtain Chahar. The reason why it has not taken active action yet is that the time has not yet come. As for North China, due to international relations, it is inconvenient for the Japanese to directly intervene. If it is absolutely necessary to take North China, it should also be done through a puppet similar to Pu Yi, so as to gain practical benefits without holding nominal power.</p>
<p>The above four points are its direct conspiracies to aggress against China. As for its conspiracies to deal with the indirect aggression of the powers against China, they are as follows: (1) The powers' attitude towards China is purely based on their own interests, with no distinction between favor and disfavor. Japan, seeing through the intentions of the powers, is using the division of China to bait the various countries, thereby seeking to reduce the jealousy of the various countries towards Japan. Its secret indication to Britain and France of Tibet and Yunnan as spheres of influence is one example. (2) Vigorously trying to obstruct the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China, and if any country aids China, it will do its best to undermine it, ensuring that China stands in a state of isolation and helplessness, at its mercy. From the above, the viciousness of Japan's conspiracy can be generally seen. (May 26th)</p>
<h3>The Northeast Volunteer Army is Still Fighting Bitterly: The Bloody Battles in Eastern Jilin Over the Past Few Months, The Hand-to-Hand Combat at Zhongkui Temple in Liaoning, The Expansion of Wang Delin's Troops, Li Du's Troops</h3>
<p>Xie Wentong, the acting commander-in-chief of the Northeast People's Self-Defense Army, and Zhou Yashan, the commander-in-chief, both of whom are former subordinates of General Li Du, recently sent personnel with secret letters to the south to report to General Li on the details of the fierce battles with the Japanese and puppet forces from this spring to the present, and the shooting down of four Japanese aircraft. Their method of shooting down Japanese aircraft is to plant dozens of pine trees in the combat area, dress them in military uniforms, and when the Japanese army indiscriminately drops bombs, the Volunteer Army ambushes around the area and attacks upwards with folk self-defense iron guns, so they are able to shoot down Japanese aircraft and kill Japanese commander Izawa and many other Japanese and puppet officers. The number of the Volunteer Army has reached more than 30,000, and its momentum is quite strong. More than ten counties in eastern Jilin, such as Yilan, Huachuan, and Boli, are all within the sphere of influence of the Volunteer Army. They are still fighting fiercely with the Japanese army. The reason why the two leaders, Xie and Zhou, were able to call for an uprising was purely due to the Japanese forcing the surrender of guns, the confiscation of land, and the extortion of five young women from every hundred households to be prostitutes for the Japanese pioneers stationed in eastern Jilin. The Japanese also hired traitors to spread poison everywhere, which made the people even more angry. The original letter from Xie Wentong to General Li is recorded as follows: "To General Zhi Chu, Since the beginning of the first month of the lunar calendar, the Japanese army has been implementing tyrannical policies such as forcing the collection of land deeds, confiscating civilian guns, and forcing the extortion of civilian women. Before the Japanese army could implement the surrender of guns and the confiscation of land, I, along with Zhou Yashan and others, led the Yilan people to revolt and first occupied Taiping Town, killing more than twenty Japanese soldiers. On March 10th, the 63rd Regiment of the Hirose Division of the Japanese Army, led by Colonel Regiment Commander Iizuka in a car with more than thirty puppet soldiers, went west of Taiping Town and engaged my army for three hours, killing Iizuka and wounding the puppet army chief of staff, Song. In this battle, the entire Japanese and puppet army was annihilated, and my army captured more than ten Type 11 machine guns, more than seventy rifles, and more than ten cars. The wounded puppet army chief of staff Song was handed over to the local authorities to be sent to Yi. My army suffered four casualties. The next day, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers arrived from Jiamusi and engaged my army, killing another twenty Japanese soldiers. On March 10th, seventeen Japanese soldiers were killed at Banjiehezi. On March 17th, at Jiu Li Liu in the Fourth District, we engaged the Japanese army, the Hiraoka unit, which led more than sixty cars with five light and heavy cannons. After about eight hours, the Japanese army was repelled. In this battle, countless guns and ammunition were captured, two Japanese captains, six lieutenants, and more than thirty soldiers were killed, and sixty Japanese were wounded. My army suffered more than twenty casualties. On April 1st, my army engaged more than a hundred Japanese soldiers in Hengdai Mountain in Yilan, fighting for about four hours, and repelled the Japanese enemy, killing Captain Nakao, two lieutenants, and more than thirty soldiers, and capturing five machine guns and a large number of rifles. On April 5th, my army attacked Mengjiagang, fighting for a day, killing more than forty Japanese soldiers. On April 15th, we attacked Dongjinggou in Huachuan and occupied the valley after fighting for about ten hours, killing more than forty Japanese and more than thirty puppet soldiers. The rest fled in all directions. On April 20th, I led my troops to occupy Huachuan County and awakened more than fifty people in the county, who all rose up to resist Japan. At this time, we were attacking Fujin. On April 26th, my army engaged the Japanese army in Hengdaohezi, Huachuan, and after fighting for five hours, killed a Japanese colonel regiment commander and more than thirty soldiers. My army lost Dong Regiment Commander, one officer, and six soldiers. On May 1st, my army attacked the Japanese reclamation army in Hunan Camp, fighting for three days and nights, shooting down four enemy planes, killing Japanese Commander Izawa, six colonel regiment commanders, and more than a hundred soldiers. My army lost Brigade Commander Jing Zhenqing, one officer, and seventy soldiers, and more than twenty were wounded. At this time, people from all counties in eastern Jilin came to surrender every day. My army now has more than 30,000 soldiers, and the morale is quite strong. Since I led my troops to fight against the Japanese and puppet forces, we have fought more than twenty battles, large and small. The Japanese and puppet forces have suffered heavy losses. The matter of confiscating land and surrendering guns in more than ten counties in eastern Jilin has now been abandoned. My army continues to fight fiercely, vowing to eliminate the Japanese bandits. The Japanese army and my combat area, including ten counties such as Hwa and Bo, have been completely looted by the Japanese and puppet forces, and they have also committed arbitrary massacres, which is unspeakable suffering. The Japanese side has repeatedly reported my army as bandits, and does not cite the reason that the people cannot endure the tyrannical rule they have imposed. I have no telegram, so the progress of the battle cannot be publicized domestically, so that the people of the country pay attention. I can only fight bitterly, to chill the enemy's courage. All my grievances cannot be conveyed. I can only secretly send personnel to secretly present the details, and earnestly request to find a way to respond, so as to strengthen our momentum. I am overwhelmed with the urgency of waiting for orders. Sincerely presented."</p>
<h3>Qi Zhanjiu's Troops</h3>
<p>Liaodong correspondence: Gao Xingya, Xu Guoliang (Zi Haikuan), Wang Huimin, the various brigade commanders of the Northeast National Salvation Army under the command of Qi Zhanjiu, and Mao Changshan's regiment, retreated from Changshanyu to the east a month ago, concentrated in the triangular area of Liaodong, and established contact with Deng Tiemei, the commander of the Eastern Route Righteous Army. They support each other, and their momentum has been revived, which is highly valued by the Japanese and puppet authorities. Therefore, on April 1st, the Japanese and puppet army totaling more than 20,000, including one brigade of Yu Zhishan's rebel army, one company of mountain artillery, one battalion of field artillery, four squadrons of Japanese army regiments, and Yu Shenzheng's rebel army, attacked the Volunteer Army. Fierce fighting lasted for a day and a night. The Volunteer Army retreated to Zhongkui Temple because there was no danger to rely on. The Japanese and puppet army continued to advance and besiege. The Volunteer Army retaliated fiercely. Hand-to-hand combat lasted for two days and nights. Brigade commanders Gao Xingya, Xu Guoliang, etc. took the lead and repeatedly defeated the enemy's vanguard. The three armies felt angry and advanced one after another. The army was greatly boosted. On the morning of the 7th, the enemy army could not hold out and retreated one after another. The Volunteer Army happened to have lost Brigade Commander Gao in battle, and because of continuous fighting for several days, they were extremely tired, so they did not want to pursue. In this battle, the Volunteer Army lost Brigade Commander Gao Xingya, Regiment Commander Mao Changshan, Company Commanders Gao Qingyu, Sun Zhenzhou, two officers, and 147 soldiers. Yu Chenzheng's rebel army lost more than 110 soldiers. There were also casualties among other units and the Japanese army, but each time they charged, the rebel army was in the front and the Japanese army was in the rear, implementing the poisonous policy of using Chinese to attack Chinese, so the Japanese army suffered fewer casualties. According to the Japanese invaders, since occupying the Northeast, there have not been many Volunteer Army officers as brave as Commander Gao in supervising the battle, which is enough to show that my righteous generals and soldiers, even after death, still chill the courage of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Wang Delin's Troops</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, after retreating to Russia and returning to China last year, continues his arduous struggle based on his advocacy of resisting Japan and saving the country. Recently, Li Yitian, a special military envoy of his troops, entered the Pass from the front lines to report on the situation of the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast, saying that since the beginning of spring, the volunteer armies have been extremely active, especially in Jilin and eastern Liaoning. Recently, Vice Commander Kong Xianrong led troops under Yao Zhenshan, Xu Jiesan, and others to briefly occupy Hengdaohezi, destroying roads, overturning vehicles, and seizing a considerable number of guns and bullets, greatly shocking the Japanese and puppet troops. The army is determined to engage in long-term resistance, and to encourage morale and promote ideology, in addition to fighting the enemy, they have chosen secluded places in the deep mountains for training. Therefore, the morale of the general volunteer army has been exceptionally high recently, and all are determined to die rather than surrender, in order to preserve the immortal glory in history. Recently, the unit has slightly expanded its original organization. It includes the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Deputy Commander Kong Xianrong, directly under the Independent Division Xu Jiesan, First Brigade Gao Yushan, Second Brigade Sun Baoding, Third Brigade Wang Chunxu, Independent First Brigade Shan De, Independent Second Brigade Chai Shirong, Independent Third Brigade Gao Junfeng, Jilin Commander-in-Chief Wu Yicheng, First Route Commander-in-Chief Zhou Baozhong, Second Route Fu Dianchen, Third Route Du Liansheng, Fourth Route Luo Mingxing, Fifth Route Qi Youquan, Sixth Route Yao Zhenshan, Seventh Route Zhang Yuting, Guerrilla Commander Li Qingbin, First Brigade Li Yushan, Second Brigade Yang Taihe, Third Brigade Li Jiantang, First Detachment Shen Qinglin, Second Detachment Gao Dongshan, Third Friendly Detachment Zhang Mingyuan, Fourth Detachment Sun Chaoyang, Fifth Detachment Zhuang Xiangchen, Sixth Detachment Shi Zhongheng, and in addition, there is the Special Forces of Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin, totaling more than 50,000 men. All these troops are located in Jilin and areas bordering eastern Liaoning. The detailed locations of each unit are kept confidential and cannot be disclosed in detail. Many volunteer armies from Liaoning, Ningxia, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces have also heard of their reputation and come to join them, hoping to support Commander-in-Chief Wang as their leader. Further reports will be made after the reorganization is completed.</p>
<h3>He Jian Passes Through Hankou to Jiangxi 丨 Zhu Shaoliang Also Arrives in Hankou from Lanzhou 丨</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Army for Suppressing Bandits in the Five Provinces and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, came to Hankou on the Tonghe steamer at 9:00 PM on the 25th from Changsha, specifically to consult with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on important public matters. Mrs. He, her daughter, He Haoruo (Director of the Party and Government Affairs Department), Ling Zhang (Director of the Office), and Xiong Daogan (Director of the Adjutant's Office) accompanied him. The steamer passed through Yuezhou at dawn on the 26th, stopped for an hour, summoned local military and political leaders, and then continued sailing. It arrived at the Hankou pier at 8:30 PM that evening. Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Qian Dajun, Liu Zhenhua, and Hu Xiehuai, the representative of the Western Route stationed in Hankou, all went to the pier to welcome him. After landing, He separately visited Zhang and He to discuss bandit suppression, and also visited Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Zhu Shaoliang, and others. It was decided that he would take the Jihe steamer eastward on the 27th, or travel with Zhu Shaoliang and Li Jue by plane. Zhu flew from Lanzhou to Hankou on the 25th, also to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi. In a speech in Hankou, He stated: "The remaining bandits in Hunan Province have been largely pacified, and post-war reconstruction is being carried out in various places. Although there are still a few remaining bandits in eastern Hunan, they are being suppressed. I recently inspected the Pingliu area and instructed the generals on the strategy for suppression. They will probably be eliminated soon. The remnant forces of Xiao Ke are wandering on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and have been severely hit by the various columns of our army. There are currently several thousand people with very few firearms and a shortage of ammunition. Because they are hiding in the mountains on the border of Hunan and Hubei, the armies of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are conducting a joint suppression, and their elimination can be expected. Liu Jianxu is now stationed in Yongxin to supervise the suppression of scattered bandits and implement post-war reconstruction. I am going to pay my respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation of our army's bandit suppression and to request instructions on everything. I will stay in Jiangxi for a few days and then return to Hunan via Hankou." (26th)</p>
<h3>Jiaoji Railway Actively Transports Local Products 丨 Gathering Local Products Merchants to Hold Talks 丨</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Shandong's local products have been showing signs of improvement in recent months due to active relief efforts from various parties. The Jiaoji Railway's transportation of local products has also gradually become busy. In the past, local products shipped from Jinan to Qingdao were attached to ordinary freight trains due to economic reasons. When passing through various marshalling stations along the way, they had to be re-allocated and re-attached to avoid wasting locomotive power. Therefore, when the train arrived at Zhangdian, Fangzi, and other stations, it was re-attached and dispatched in sections. As a result, ordinary freight trains from Jinan to Qingdao took an average of two to three days to arrive, causing detours and delays, which was extremely inconvenient for businesses. Now, the Jiaoji Railway Transportation Department, in order to facilitate the transport of peanuts and other local products awaiting export at Jinan Station, specially opened through freight train No. 72 on May 20th to transport local products from Jinan to Cangku, Sifang, Dagang, Qingdao, and other stations. The train will no longer be re-allocated at the marshalling stations along the way. It departs from Jinan at 7:20 PM and arrives in Qingdao at 6:00 PM the next evening, which is much faster than before.</p>
<p>In order to exchange opinions with local product merchants along the line and facilitate the transportation of local products, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau convened a tea party at 3:00 PM on the 23rd in the auditorium of the bureau, gathering representatives of local product merchants from Qingdao and Jinan. More than 20 merchants from Qingdao, seven from Dagang, and two from Jinan attended. First, the Director of the Military Affairs Department, Tan Shukuai, reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that there were few opportunities for the railway and merchants to meet on weekdays, and misunderstandings were inevitable. The nature of this meeting was to exchange opinions between the two parties. If the merchants had any opinions on the railway, they were welcome to bring them up for discussion. Most importantly, the railway had recently added a direct freight train between Jinan and Qingdao to facilitate the export of raw peanuts, and the results since its launch had been good. However, raw peanuts accounted for only half of the cargo, and the rest was mostly soybeans. Please consider carefully whether there is a need and possibility to continue this train based on the actual situation. He also provided details on the current transportation situation and capacity of the Jiaoji Railway. Next, Committee Member Cui Shijie of the railway delivered a speech, stating that there was a lack of communication between the railway and merchants. Although the railway always sought to provide convenience for merchants, the merchants still felt inconvenient. The railway should not bear full responsibility for this situation. Everyone should understand the environment in which the railway operated, and in the midst of great difficulties, it was constantly seeking to increase equipment to facilitate transportation. He deeply believed that the railway staff were dutiful and law-abiding, but the railway had 10,000 employees, and it was difficult to oversee everything. If there were any inconveniences for commercial transportation, please bring them up so that they could be improved. Subsequently, there was a discussion on many issues related to transportation. It was decided to maintain the current status of the direct freight train for the time being, and to change it to a train that went directly to stations east of Fangzi in the future, depending on the circumstances, in order to load and unload soybeans. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. (26th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Prospers Mount Tai 丨 Approves Road and Bridge Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Mount Tai is a major scenic spot in Shandong Province, with towering peaks and majestic beauty. Those who come to Shandong for sightseeing will visit Qufu and climb Mount Tai. In the late spring and early summer, there are many tourists. The Jinpu Railway Bureau has recently built a hotel in Mount Tai to provide a place for tourists to rest. The provincial government is also actively organizing to prosper Mount Tai and attract tourists. The Construction Department has built a road from the railway station to the foot of the mountain, a distance of six or seven li, and is also planning to build bridges. The original estimated cost was 13,000 yuan, but after a re-survey, the cost is now 5,400 yuan. At today's (25th) provincial government administrative meeting, the Construction Department submitted this proposal for discussion, requesting that funds be allocated from the provincial treasury for construction. The proposal was approved. The proposal is recorded as follows: The Secretariat reported that the Construction Department submitted a proposal to construct a new road to Mount Tai, which was approved at a previous political meeting. The road was approved to be built first, and the bridge project was planned separately. The Construction Department then dispatched technician Yang Judou to conduct a re-survey. According to the report, the designed flood bridge, from the road entrance on both sides of the Mountain Water River, would be 1.8 meters above the riverbed and would cost 13,000 yuan. Now, using the sandbar at the high point of the riverbed as the base point, this section is 37.5 meters long and will be built as a gravel road. The remaining part will be built as a riverbed bridge with nine spans. The rest will be built with retaining walls and the road surface between the pliers and the sandbar will be constructed in the same way, which will cost about 5,475 yuan and four corners. It is reasonable to request approval. According to this, the proposed plan is about 7,000 yuan cheaper than the original estimate. Is it permissible to approve the allocation of funds from the provincial treasury for construction? Please make a public decision on how to handle the matter. (25th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Shipping Vessel Statistics 丨 Route Length 4,529 Kilometers 丨 472 Steamships</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: There have been few investigations and statistics on steamships in Jiangsu Province, so it is impossible to know the degree of their prosperity and decline. Recently, the Construction Department has conducted separate investigations to understand the shipping situation and development in the province in order to prepare for future consolidation. According to the investigation results, the most developed areas for shipping in the province are Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Huaiyin, Dongtai, and other counties. The length of navigable waterways for steamships in the province is 4,529 kilometers, ranking fifth among the province's railways (the total length of railways in the province is more than 960 kilometers). Among them, Wuxian has the longest navigable mileage, with 337 kilometers, accounting for 7% of the total. As for the rivers and waterways in various counties that are navigable by civilian ships, there is no clear investigation. There are a total of 472 steamships passing through or mooring in Jiangsu, with a total tonnage of 5.726.00. Gasoline boats account for the majority, followed by steamships. If the tonnage of the steamships is compared, the number of ships with a tonnage of 10 to 15 tons is the largest, accounting for 14% of the total. As for the number of civilian cargo ships in the province, according to the survey of various counties in March of the 22nd year, there are approximately 18,400 ships, with a total capacity of more than 1.6 million dan. The number of ships with a load of 50 dan is the largest. The average ticket price per kilometer on the shipping lines in each county is eight li. (27th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Investigation of the Forged Commission Case is Completed. Qian Zuoyi, the outgoing magistrate of Rugao County, was implicated in the forged commission case of trial member Tang Duqing. After the case was discovered, the High Court designated the Songjiang County Court to hear the case. It is now known that Qian Zuoyi has been granted a non-prosecution disposition, and Tang Xiqing has been indicted. The case originated when Qian was the magistrate of Rugao County, and Tang Xiqing, a member of the case clearance committee, was appointed as a trial member of the county after two months. Later, when he was being evaluated, the trial member's qualifications were interrupted in the 19th year of the Republic of China. Fearing that he would be rejected, he forged two commissions from the Public Security Bureau appointing him as the chief of the Third Section, and from Zhang Yi, the former magistrate of the county, appointing him as the chief of the First Section. The then-incumbent magistrate Qian Zuoyi forwarded them to the ministry. Unexpectedly, someone reported Tang's forgery of the commission to the Supervisory Yuan, which verified the facts and transferred the case to the Disciplinary Committee for judicial handling. The case was investigated by the Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Wuxian courts. At that time, Tang Xiqing's address was unknown, and there was no way to summon him. Qian Zuoyi stated that he was busy with the work of suppressing bandits at the time, and military documents were confusing, so he was negligent in checking and forwarded them. In the end, since Tang did not appear, the case was presented to the High Court. Since Qian was a joint defendant in the county, the court ordered the local county court to hear the case. After investigation by the procuratorate, Qian Zuoyi was serving in Sichuan and could not surrender. However, the defendant Tang Xiqing suddenly came to Songjiang to surrender and confess, stating that in order to meet the qualifications, he happened to find a blank commission in the county government and filled in "Zhang Yi's name" himself. He did not explain it to Magistrate Qian, so Mr. Qian was indeed unaware. His forgery of the commission was only to seek a successful evaluation and did not harm society. He asked the court for leniency. After a clear interrogation, in addition to granting Qian Zuoyi a non-prosecution disposition, the investigating officer decided to indict Tang Xiqing and transfer him to the criminal court for trial.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Various Groups in Changshu Defend Yang Qingjiu Against False Accusations</h3>
<p>Yang Qingjiu, the captain of the 8th Team of the 2nd District of the Changshu Water Public Security Bureau, was falsely accused of being a bandit sympathizer. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs ordered Wei, the district chief of the 2nd District of Suzhou, to suspend Yang from his duties and temporarily detain him in the 2nd District Office. The Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, and other legal entities stated that Yang was upright in nature and had served the local area for more than ten years. He was loyal to his duties on weekdays and would not have colluded with bandits. They sent telegrams to the Provincial Department to defend Yang against the false accusations. The case originated when Xiao County captured three bandits in Changshu: Wang Xiaofa, Wang Jinming, and Hao Huizi. In Xiao County, they confessed that members of the 8th Team participated in various robberies in Changshu, and that the main culprit in the Hejiashi robbery in Changshu, Zhang Changbin, was a close relative of Yang Qingjiu. The pistol of Wang Jinming, the bandit leader, was allegedly stored at the home of Yang Qingxiang, the younger brother of Captain Yang. It has now been found that Yang Qingxiang is not Yang Qingjiu's younger brother, and Zhang Changbin is not a close relative of Yang Qingjiu. He is a former police officer of the 8th Team and is probably impersonating him to spread rumors. Yang Qingjiu himself also submitted a statement to the Provincial Department, stating that after the three bandits were captured in Xiao County, the 8th Team of the Water Public Security Bureau also captured Shen Qingchang and two others who had falsely guaranteed the bandits, and sent them to Changshu County for interrogation. He also reported the case to the District Office, showing a frank attitude. Now, people from Changshu living in Suzhou also sent telegrams to the Provincial Department to clear Yang's name, as he had contributed to the local area during the January 28th Incident.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Bandits Repeatedly Send Threatening Letters</h3>
<p>Yang Sibao, the owner of the Yongxing Clothing Store in Dangkou Town, Nanyan City, 11th District, and residents Yin Guanqing and Hua Xuemei, simultaneously received threatening letters from bandits on the 5th day of the first lunar month, demanding 200 yuan in silver. They were instructed to wrap the money in blue cloth and leave it at the corner of the large ditch next to Hua Yi's flower garden after 5:00 PM on the 10th, otherwise they would be dealt with by gun and their whole family would be killed. The letter was sent from the mailbox on North Street in the town, and the tone was very intense. After receiving the letter, Yang and others reported to the 7th Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau in charge and requested an investigation. Unexpectedly, on the 10th, Yang continued to receive the same threatening letter, instructing him to wrap 200 yuan in silver in blue cloth and leave it at the turning point of the Huai Fen Women's School playground behind Huqiao Lane at 6:30 PM on the 14th, otherwise he would be shot. The authorities are currently conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Hangs Herself Due to Discord with Sister-in-law</h3>
<p>In Dingta Village, Wusan Tu, Qianxiang Place, half a li from Yeqiao Town in the 5th District, Bingfu, the second son of Wu Sanbao, a villager, was working at the Tongmao Printing House in Shanghai. He married a woman named Zhang (24 years old), and had been married for just over two years. Recently, rural farmhouses have been extremely busy with silkworms. The night before, after dinner, Zhang was still helping to cut firewood to prepare for the silkworms to climb the frames. Then she closed the door and went to bed. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 AM yesterday, she had not yet gotten up. Her aunt peeked through the door and suddenly saw Zhang hanging high from the beam in the room, with a pale face. She was greatly shocked and immediately called Sanbao to pry open the door and enter the room to try to save her. However, Zhang had already died. Wu Sanbao, together with Tu Zheng You Yunlong, came to the city to report to the local branch court prosecutor's office, requesting permission to waive the autopsy. After Prosecutor Shen opened the court for questioning, he ordered that the autopsy not be waived and that officials be sent to conduct it. It is said that the reason for Zhang's suicide was discord with her sister-in-law, and she was angry.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Another Robbery Occurs in the City</h3>
<p>After the assassination of Yu Canrong and the robbery of a large sum of money, residents in Wuyi City were wary. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 PM on the 25th, three robbers broke into the grain store opened by Qian Huansheng at No. 32 Zhongjia Lane, a Shikumen building. They first pretended to be shopping, then closed the gate, pointed a gun at the shop owner Qian Huansheng, and warned him not to make a sound. They went to the counter and swept away all the silver dollars. At that time, the landlord Yan Wende happened to be coming out of the inner room and knew it was a robbery. He turned around and went out over the wall from the back, intending to report to the police team. However, he was too anxious and injured his leg. His younger brother Wen Shu ran to report to the police team. By the time the Public Security Bureau and other police teams arrived, the bandits had already fled far away.</p>

During the banquet, Zhan Jingtang delivered a speech, and Wang Xiaolai responded. The guests dispersed at 10:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>During the banquet, the head of the group, Zhan Jingtang, gave a speech, saying, "Everyone, our group came to Shanghai to inspect industry this time, and we have received a lot of guidance from all aspects, which has given all our colleagues endless benefits. Jingtang would like to thank you all on behalf of all our colleagues. Today, we have prepared a simple meal, and we are very honored that you have all come. Our country's material civilization has always been backward. Since the European winds have gradually prevailed, and because of the poor political conditions of the previous Qing Dynasty, many unequal treaties have been signed, and the doors have been opened wide, so that our country's markets are flooded with foreign goods, and foreigners simply regard it as a large sales market. Money flows out, and the annual trade deficit reaches tens of millions of yuan. Fortunately, in recent years, patriots have realized this and have been catching up, creating various industries. At the same time, the government is trying to promote and reward them, and social figures are running around and calling for mutual encouragement, which has resulted in today's achievements. Imperialists, seeing our progress day by day, are using dumping policies to compete for the market, which has led to the bankruptcy of domestic rural areas and the economic depression of society, resulting in serious internal and external troubles. If the Chinese people do not urgently seek self-help in the face of today's dangerous situation in China, then danger will await us. Looking ahead, I can't help but feel terrified. What is the way to self-help? It is that all colleagues in the national industrial sector must stand on the same front and strive hard, externally dealing with imperialist economic aggressors and internally resisting adverse environments. Within the industrial sector itself, we must love each other, help each other, and work together in harmony. In this way, the future of our country's industry will not lack a day of development and prosperity. To go a step further, Shanghai and Qingdao have a special relationship, just like the support car and the jaw being attached, the lips dying and the teeth feeling cold. Shanghai's industry has a long history and is already quite remarkable. Qingdao is like a kidnapped orphan, just escaping from danger and celebrating its rebirth. If the fathers and brothers do not diligently cultivate this orphan, then it will be in danger of dying young, not only a shame for the part, but a shame for our entire nation. Those who bear the responsibility of this cultivation are not only the local people of Shandong Province, but those who have the courage, perseverance, technical ability, and financial resources, such as all of you present here. Qingdao has a mild climate, a deep and ice-free harbor, and huge sea ships can directly enter the port. The dock facilities are especially perfect. The Jiaoji Railway will soon be connected with the major domestic trunk lines. The railway authorities have a plan to expand it, which can be realized soon. Shandong Province is rich in products, most of which can be used as raw materials for industry, and the people are hardworking and resilient, which is especially a characteristic. In addition, the roads are clean and the scenery is beautiful, which are all extras. Therefore, Qingdao has all the advantages of weather, geography, and people. Since Qingdao has the above advantages, I hope that all of you will give Qingdao's industry full material and spiritual assistance, so that Qingdao can become an Oriental Chicago, and those who despise our nation will instead admire it. To put it another way, Shanghai is like an elder brother, and Qingdao is like a younger brother. The achievements made by the hard work of all of you in Shanghai can be imitated and learned by Qingdao without any effort, and they can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. Not only that, but we must also ask you to provide material and spiritual assistance in the future. This point must be understood by all of you. Our group came to Shanghai to inspect this time and has benefited greatly from the guidance of Mayor Wu and all the officials, Chairman Wang of the Chamber of Commerce and all the gentlemen, Chairman Guo of the Industrial Federation and all the gentlemen, and the gentlemen of various factories. We have received much material and spiritual assistance. All the colleagues of our group are very grateful. Our group will leave Shanghai by car on the 28th. Because the trip is hasty, we have not been able to say goodbye to all of you one by one. I hope you will forgive me. I have prepared a simple meal and wine to express my gratitude and wish you victory in the future of industry and good health to all of you present here."</p>
<h3>Departing for Wuxi Today</h3>

The planned trip is two days, then they will go to the capital for inspection, deciding to stay for two days, and then take the Shanghai-Ping train to Jinan for a visit, also planned for two days. After finishing the work, they will return to Qingdao soon. All sectors in Wuxi have sent personnel to Shanghai to welcome them in advance.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association, at the invitation of Chairman He of the Hunan Provincial Government and Director Yu of the Construction Department, led the Shanghai National Goods Traveling Group to participate in the Hunan Provincial National Goods Mobile Exhibition. The exhibition opened on May 1st and caused a sensation, creating a passionate national goods movement. The two-week period expired and closed on the 14th. The products of various factories were inexpensive and of high quality, and the total sales were excellent. The representatives of the group, except for a portion who went directly to Ping to participate in the Railway Exhibition, the remaining 164 representatives, led by Secretary-General Xu Qiaoqi and Secretary Huang Mengtu, returned to Shanghai on the Changxing Wheel of the Sanbei Company. It is learned that the representatives of the group arrived in Shanghai at 9:20 yesterday morning. Standing Committee member Chen Yiting, Executive Committee member Lin Guyun, staff members Zhu Jinxiang, Wu Zishi, etc., and representatives from various factories all went to the pier to welcome and comfort them. For a time, firecrackers shook the sky, hats and scarves flew together, the situation was lively, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The New News Agency reporter went to the ship to interview Secretary Huang, who said that the association led the Shanghai National Goods Traveling Group to participate in the Hunan Provincial National Exhibition, realizing the plan to promote national goods to the Central China region, gathering the power of national goods to save the country. Hunan is the center of the revolution, and the people are simple and have a passion for using national goods. At the time of vigorously implementing the New Life Movement, the promotion of national goods should be vigorously promoted. The inexpensive and high-quality products of various factories in Shanghai are well-known throughout Hunan. This time, Chairman He and Director Yu led the promotion, and various provincial and municipal agencies and public organizations sponsored the publicity, which aroused enthusiastic welcome from all sectors of the people. More than 1.5 million people attended the exhibition. The sales volume in the 14 days was 377,493 yuan, of which Shanghai manufacturers accounted for 249,758 yuan, accounting for more than 60% of the total. Wuhan manufacturers were more than 37,400 yuan, Changsha manufacturers were more than 35,300 yuan, and manufacturers originally in the National Goods Exhibition Hall were more than 54,500 yuan, which shows the prosperity of Hunanese people using national goods. Shops all over the city expressed their appreciation for the products of Shanghai factories. Representatives were sent by various trade associations to contact the sales promotion, promoting mutual factory assistance and production and sales cooperation. Their enthusiasm for the national goods cause and the development of economic construction is a model among the model merchants in the province. Therefore, all factories are willing to sincerely agree with it. This is the best impression of this group's participation in the national exhibitions in various provinces and cities, opening a new record for sales promotion plans. Chairman He, Director Yu of the Construction Department, Director Zhang of the Finance Department, and Curator Liu, because of the excellent results, great mission, business satisfaction, and public welcome of the National Exhibition, sincerely expressed at the farewell banquet their desire to invite all Shanghai manufacturers to come to Hunan next year to hold the second National Exhibition in the newly built National Goods Auditorium and to do their best to promote the sales of national goods in Central China. The care of Chairman He and others for national goods is especially deeply appreciated by the group and various manufacturers. It is reported that after the members of the group and the representatives of various factories arrive in Shanghai, they will take a short rest and, after recovering from their fatigue, will go to Jinan or Anqing for exhibitions.</p>

<h3>North China Through Train Measures, Both Parties Form a Third Organization, Passenger Transport is Handled First, Freight Transport is Temporarily Postponed, Can Be Implemented in Mid-June</h3>
<p>Specific measures have been drafted for the North China through train issue. Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, came to Shanghai to meet with Huang Fu, to discuss everything for the final amendment, and then Mr. Yin went to Beijing to report to the Standing Bureau for instructions. According to reliable sources, this reporter learned yesterday that a certain travel agency is afraid of being attacked by various parties and that undertaking it is not profitable, so it does not want to handle it. The relationship between Tongjilong and European and American foreign firms is not welcomed by the other party, and it wants to handle it but cannot, so it has been decided that the Beining Railway Bureau and the South Manchuria Railway will jointly form a third organization to handle the through train matters. The first step is to handle passenger transport first, and freight transport will be handled slowly due to various troubles. The implementation period is about mid-June. Mr. Yin will go to Beijing to ask for instructions within the day.</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders the British-American Tobacco Factory Strike to Be Resolved Within a Time Limit, the Social Affairs Bureau Will Convene Both Parties Tomorrow Morning for Mediation</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the British-American Tobacco Factory strike is still serious. Members of the Municipal Party Department went to Beijing the night before last to ask for instructions, and the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene mediation tomorrow. The maritime organizations decided to stop loading and unloading British-American products from June 1st. The five district cigarette workers' unions continued to send telegrams to Chairman Chiang to petition. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Party Committee Went to Beijing for Instructions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, because the British-American Tobacco Factory strike is of great importance, involving the livelihood of workers and local security, in addition to reporting to the Central Committee and properly planning the disposal with the Municipal Government, in order to prevent the expansion of the dispute and to seek an early solution, specially sent Supervisory Committee member Wu Kaixian to Beijing to ask the Central Committee for instructions. It is learned that Mr. Wu took a car to Beijing the night before last to ask the Central Committee for instructions on the handling measures and will return to Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>This Morning's Renewed Petition</h3>
<p>The British American Tobacco Factory Strike Committee, in view of the factory's persistent attitude and the indefinite resumption of work, believes that if this continues, accidents are bound to occur, which will greatly affect local security. Therefore, it was decided to send strike committee members Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Wang Amao, Hu Xiaomei, and thirty-five others to the Kuomintang headquarters in Fenglin Bridge at 10:00 a.m. this morning to petition, requesting a speedy resolution so that the matter can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Sailors Refuse to Transport Products</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seamen's Union Branch, after receiving a request for assistance from the British American Tobacco Factory Strike Committee, believes that it is a matter of supporting the labor movement. It has decided to issue a notice to all sailors to refuse to transport products on a regular basis. The original letter is recorded as follows: (omitted above) In reply to your letter, we have learned everything. This time, the factory has disregarded the livelihoods of thousands of workers and unreasonably closed the old factory, violating our country's laws and regulations and putting the workers in a desperate situation. If we do not resist, what can we expect for the future? The Union expresses its deep sympathy for your solidarity and struggle, and besides reporting to the Central Government to uphold justice, it has also ordered the tallymen under its jurisdiction to refuse to load and transport British American Tobacco Factory products to promote their awareness. In addition, it will lead more than 30,000 sailors to prepare everything to support your union. I hope you will continue to work hard and not be discouraged, and please inform us of the progress at any time.</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders Resolution within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>Since the British American Tobacco Factory strike occurred, it has attracted great attention from all parties due to the large number of workers involved and the seriousness of the problem. It is now learned that the municipal Kuomintang headquarters and the municipal government have received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, ordering them to handle the matter carefully and resolve it by the end of this month. On the one hand, they should persuade the workers to resume work, so as to prevent the strike from escalating. It is said that the Kuomintang and government officials have already agreed on a proper handling method after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Mediation to be Convened Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs notified both parties yesterday that it would convene both parties for mediation at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (29th). The notification is recorded as follows: Notification regarding the dispute over the closure of the British American Tobacco Company's first factory. The Bureau has scheduled mediation for 10:00 a.m. on May 29th. Both parties are hereby notified to designate two responsible representatives to come to the Bureau to await mediation. This is specially notified. May 25th, Republic of China, Year 23, Wu Xingya, Director.</p>
<h3>Separate Receptions for All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Association believes that the British American Tobacco Company's illegal closure of the first factory has cut off the livelihoods of 3,000 workers, leading to a general strike at the new factory. In order to make all sectors understand the truth and provide practical assistance, it has scheduled to host all members of the Executive Committee of the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon, and to host reporters from various newspapers the day after tomorrow, to report on the closure and the strike situation. It will also host banquets for various Chinese cigarette factories to request practical assistance.</p>
<h3>Continued Petition to Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>The Strike Committee sent another telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, which reads: Urgent. Respectfully to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanchang Headquarters: On the 26th of this month, I received a telegram from you. However, the details of the origin of this turmoil were not fully detailed, and I must state them again to you. Although the strike violates the regulations, the responsibility lies with us. The British American Tobacco Company in Pudong, citing poor business conditions, has reduced work three times in a row in less than a month, starting with six days a week, then five days, and then to 40 hours per week, and then to 36 hours. During this period, the Municipal Kuomintang Headquarters and the Municipal Government went through mediation procedures and clearly ordered the factory not to reduce work without the approval of the competent authorities. However, the factory refused to comply. However, the workers were able to continue working as usual. The reason why they did not actively resist was that the national crisis had not been resolved and foreign aggression was imminent, and they did not want to cause major disputes over trivial matters. Their painstaking efforts can be attested to by Heaven and Earth. Who would have thought that the company would regard our government as weak and the workers as deceivable, and suddenly closed the old factory, which it had founded, on the 12th of this month without any reason? The livelihoods of thousands of workers were cut off, triggering a general strike in the new factory. We were forced to do this and there was no way to avoid it. Fortunately, all the workers were united and determined to demand the reopening of the factory. Social order has not been disturbed in the slightest. However, the workers depend on the factory for their livelihood. If this continues, how can their livelihood be sustained? It has been found that the company has been using new-style express vehicles to increase production in recent years, and has also signed contracts with Flag and other factories to entrust the raw materials to be rolled on their behalf, resulting in overproduction and not poor business conditions. Even if the business conditions are really poor, compared with the company's capital, it will never reach the point of closing the factory. Even if there is a reason to close the factory, it should first be submitted to the local Kuomintang and government agencies for approval, and the workers should be notified in advance so that they can seek other livelihoods. However, the company has acted freely and has no government in its eyes. The company's intention is nothing more than that the workers in the old factory have worked the longest and their wages are the highest. Today, the factory is closed, so that a large amount of compensation can be avoided. When the factory is reopened in the future, new workers can be hired, and wages and benefits can be reduced. In the future, British American Tobacco factories in China will follow suit, and the company can freely close factories and dismiss workers at any time and anywhere. Other factories will follow suit, increasing unemployment and affecting social order. It is believed that the British American Tobacco Company has always despised our government. At the end of the Republic of China's 16th year, when the National Revolutionary Army was on the Northern Expedition and fought a bloody battle with Sun Chuanfang in Xuzhou, the company colluded with the Northern Warlords and violated national taxes. The workers of factories 1, 2, and 3 were enraged and went on strike. Through long-term struggle and great sacrifice, the company finally recognized national taxes, and the front-line military supplies were not lacking. The soldiers of the three armies were delighted and their courage was doubled. The downfall of the warlords and the success of the Northern Expedition were due to the humble efforts of the workers. Looking at the plaque in the hall and the medals on our bodies, recalling the past, we are heartbroken. Recently, you, as the leader, have been promoting labor-management cooperation and have issued orders prohibiting labor from striking and capital from closing factories. You have repeatedly advised foreign capitalists to understand this and strive for cooperation. However, they have oppressed the workers and become more and more severe. The expansion of this turmoil is entirely the fault of the company. You are a founding hero of the Kuomintang and the country, admired by all. With your high mirror, you can distinguish right from wrong. I dare to enumerate the situation below and tearfully implore you to consider the previous efforts and order the company to reopen the first factory immediately to maintain the livelihood of the workers. I have no other request. I am in dire straits and cannot bear the anxiety of awaiting your order. I respectfully request your safety. Respectfully from the British American Tobacco Factory Strike Committee of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Quorum-Less Meeting of the Lawyers' Association – Over Two Hundred and Forty Members Attended, Still Short of the Legal Minimum</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, in order to revise its charter as ordered, and to reinstate the president system as it existed before the 16th year of the Republic of China, has convened three temporary membership meetings without success, delaying the charter revision until now. At a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, it was re-scheduled for 2:00 PM yesterday, the 27th (Sunday), at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association on Xizang Road to continue the fourth temporary membership meeting. Fearing that there would still be insufficient members for a quorum, all members were asked to gather at the Xin Xin Restaurant on Nanjing Road before the meeting for a meal, and then go to the meeting venue. Members attending included Shen Junru, Wang Weizhen, Chen Tingrui, Qu Yue, Lu Shaozong, Qin Liankui, Wu Guotai, Shi Qinghua, Fang Jifan, Yuan Xingyun, Hong Shihao, Zhao Chaochang, Xue Lisheng, Wu Guochang, Zhou Yu, Wang Boxian, Li Yujun, Qin Zemin, Zhu Fuji, Bian Jialu, Ma Junshuo, Zhu Huan, Mao Yun, Wu Zhengzhuo, Wang Shaotong, Gan Lin, Huang Daping, Ding Shimin, Zhang Shijie, Shan Yuhua, Jiang Yiping, Gao Junxiang, Cha Renwei, Fan Gang, Wu Qilun, and more than two hundred and forty others. Tao Baichuan from the Municipal Kuomintang Headquarters, Zhao Chuanjia from the Shanghai District Court, Zhang Junqing from the First Special District, and Zhang Zongru from the Second Special District attended to monitor the meeting as three prosecutors. At 3:30, the bell was rung to start the meeting, and the presidium members Shen Junru, Chen Tingrui, and Wang Weizhen took their seats. The ceremony was performed, and Chairman Shen Junru reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that the association was ordered by the Judicial Administration Department to revise its charter and change the officers to a president system. The number of members present was only over two hundred and forty, while the total number of members of the association was one thousand one hundred and sixteen. According to the one-quarter quorum requirement, two hundred and eighty members were required. There was still a shortage of members to meet the quorum. It was up to the members to decide whether to exclude the members with outstanding fees from the calculation as per custom. The members generally agreed to exclude them from the calculation, and then the charter was discussed in order. Then, the Kuomintang representative saw that the charter stipulated that a member could withdraw from the association after a resolution by the council and a report. He asked Chairman Shen Junru for consultation. Although some strongly advocated handling the matter according to custom, the chairman continued to consult. Then, Kuomintang representative Tao Baichuan rose and said that if the members who had not paid their dues were excluded from the count for the quorum at today's meeting, and the association had a precedent for this, it would be okay to hold the meeting. However, according to legal procedures, it seemed inappropriate. Even if there was a precedent, could it not be used as an excuse for future members? He still asked for a public decision. After a long discussion, many members expressed their opinions, saying that since there were not enough members for a quorum, it should still be changed to a discussion meeting. It was already 5:20 PM, and the members present saw that this problem was not easy to solve and left one after another. The chairman then announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the date for the continuation of the meeting would be decided after the executive and supervisory committees met.</p>

<h3>Young Navigator Qin Zhengru Makes Two Inventions: Simple and Convenient Tools for Finding a Ship's Position</h3>
<p>Young navigator Qin Zhengru has recently invented two types of nautical charts: "Chart of Ship Position by two Bearings of an object and one line" and the tool "Capt.T.G.Chine's Distance Ruler". They are accurate and convenient to use, and are very important for maritime safety, as knowing the exact location of a ship during navigation can reduce the occurrence of unfortunate maritime disasters such as grounding and stranding.</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Qin Zhengru</h3>
<p>Qin is from Jiading, Jiangsu Province, and is the eldest son of Qin Yuan, a mathematician, and the nephew of Qin Fen. He graduated from Wusong Fisheries School and is a certified Class A captain by the Ministry of Communications. He has served as captain, first mate, and second mate on various ships in the Jianghai. He has extensive knowledge and experience in navigation. He started his maritime life at the age of fifteen or sixteen. When he first became a captain, he was only over twenty years old, less than half the age of foreign old shipowners, so he was often jokingly called the "Baby Captain". Recently, he resigned from his position as captain of the Minsheng Industrial Company to focus on research with his fifteen or sixteen years of nautical experience and knowledge, and invented the "Chart of Ship Position by two Bearings of an object and one line" and the "Capt.T.G.Chine's Distance Ruler" to meet the needs of the nautical community. He will soon return to maritime life.</p>
<h3>Principles and Applications</h3>
<p>The "Chart of Ship Position by two Bearings of an object and one line" uses a point as the center and a radius of one to create a circle. Then, concentric circles are created with a unit radius of one. Two perpendicular lines are drawn through the center of the circle to define east, south, west, and north, and then divided into thirty-two bearings, one hundred and twenty-eight gua tuo (one-quarter of a bearing). Now, assuming that a ship is sailing and sees a lighthouse, first measure its direction, and after sailing a few nautical miles, measure the direction of the lighthouse again, and the position of the ship can be found on the chart. When applying, use the measured first and second bearings of the lighthouse and the direction of travel (course) to circle the bearing lines on the chart with a pencil. On the course, starting from the center, use one circle as one nautical mile. If you sail several nautical miles, count to the corresponding circle and mark it with a pen to create a parallel line to the first bearing. The intersection point with the second bearing is the position of the ship. Counting from this intersection point to the center, the number of circles obtained is the distance in nautical miles between the ship and the lighthouse. The chart only needs to draw one line to find the answer, so the time spent is about seven to fifteen seconds, unlike other solutions that take several minutes or have not yet yielded results. If you want to make a very precise answer, do not use one-quarter of a point as the unit of direction, but change to degrees, that is, divide the entire circumference into 360 degrees, add a proportional line of longitude, and you can also find the latitude and longitude of the ship. The "Capt.T.G.Chine's Distance Ruler" is made of three rulers, A, B, and C. One end of rulers A and B is connected by a hinge and can be opened and closed. One end of ruler C is connected to ruler A and can be moved along it and rotated around it. When applying, ruler A points to the first direction of the lighthouse, ruler B points to the second direction, and ruler C points to the direction of travel. The scale marked on ruler C shows the distance traveled. By moving ruler C to the required direction and scale, the scale shown at the intersection of rulers C and A and B is the distance between the ship and the lighthouse at the time of observation. It is very convenient and quick to use. The distance meter can also be used to replace the three-arm protractor, and it can also be used to find the intersection bearing method (CrossBearing), which can be used for three purposes with one image. It is currently being manufactured for adoption by the nautical community, and it is planned to be sent to the Royal Institute of Navigation in the United Kingdom so that the entire nautical community in the world can benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>Case of Bing Jiang Garden's Mixed Sale of Illicit Salt: Testing Results Differ from Jiuda Refined Salt; Both Sides' Arguments Concluded, Court Orders Pronouncement Pending</h3>
<p>The two Wankang Jiang Garden locations on Hankou Road and Shantou Road were found to be importing inferior salt, altering the packaging, falsely representing it as government salt, mixing it for profit, disrupting the salt administration, and harming salt tax revenue. The Songjiang Audit Branch Office discovered this, secretly instructed salt police to come to Shanghai, and with the assistance of the patrol, searched the two Jiang Garden locations and found illicit salt. The managers, Wang Deshou and Sun Ruishui, were summoned to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered them to be handed over to the Public Works Department for testing and further verification, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Public Works Department Testing Office has tested the seized salt and Jiuda salt separately. The results show that the seized salt has a higher water content, but it is difficult to distinguish further. It is also impossible to determine whether it is inferior salt as found by the Audit Branch Office. Yesterday was the date for the continuation of the trial. The Public Works Department lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the testing situation and submitted the test report. Chen Canglai from the Jiuda Company also came to the court, stating that the salt sold by Wankang was indeed purchased from the company, originally in burlap sacks, but Wankang changed it to paper packaging. However, according to the Salt Affairs Administration representatives, lawyers E Sen and Sun Zuji, the Salt Affairs Administration's refined salt regulations stipulate that granular salt should be packaged in burlap sacks and powdered salt in paper bags. The seized salt does not resemble granular salt. If it is a Jiuda product, packaging it in sacks would also be illegal. However, it does not resemble powdered salt either, as its quality is between granular and powdered. Therefore, Jiuda's behavior is also suggestive, etc. After the defense by the defendant's lawyer, Jiang Baoli, the court ordered a waiting period for the pronouncement.</p>

Recently, Lili Song's father, Patrickmreedisolga, and Ji Song's sister, Olga, in their capacity as legal representatives and guardians, hired lawyer Dai Ji'en and filed a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Guangdong natives Wilson Chow, Zhou Huier Sheng, Dickson Chow, Zhou Dikesheng, and C. Liang, Liang Xiansheng, of disrupting the family. The gist of their lawsuit is as follows: on April 28th of this year, at 5:30 AM, Lili Song and Ji Song were lured by the defendants to sign a contract at the Xinya Restaurant on May 2nd to work as dancing girls at the Huanglong Dance Hall in Hong Kong, promised a large sum of money, and were to take the Russian Empress ship on May 7th. However, the plaintiffs discovered this and rushed to the ship to find the two girls. It was found that both girls were underage, and the defendants used fraudulent methods and monetary bait to order them to keep it secret from their parents and smuggle them out of the country, which constitutes a crime under Article 257 of the criminal law. In addition, they filed a civil suit demanding compensation for losses, totaling 20,000 gold, and specified that summonses could be received and forwarded by lawyer Zhou Chao Gang. Yesterday, Wu Tingqi of the Special First Court's Third Criminal Division opened a hearing. Lawyer Zhou Chao Gang appeared in court and stated, "Upon investigation, this court instructed me to forward the summonses for Zhou Huier Sheng, Zhou Dikesheng and Liang Xian, but this lawyer does not know who these three people are. However, after reviewing the facts stated in the complaint, I know that it concerns the Huanglong Dance Hall incident. This lawyer, having represented the dance hall in signing a contract with the two dancing girls, has some knowledge of this matter. The manager of the dance hall is Zhou Dichan, not Dikesheng. From this, it can be inferred that Zhou Huier Sheng is likely Zhou Zhengquan (2), the brother of Zhou Tiaochen (Zhou and Zhou are brothers of Zhou Xianjue, the former president of the First Special District Local Court). As for who Liang Xian is, I do not know. Today, Zhou Dichan is in Hong Kong and cannot attend court. Zhou Zhengquan has already arrived in court with lawyer He Qingyun," etc. Lawyer Dai immediately stated that the plaintiffs only knew their English names and did not know their Chinese names, hence the misunderstanding. Then the two girls pointed out a person sitting in the audience as Zhou Zhengquan. The court ordered Zhou Zhengqian to stand in the defendant's box and then questioned the two girls about what had happened. According to them, they were recruited by the defendants to work as dancing girls at the Huanglong Dance Hall in Hong Kong and signed a contract stating that they would be paid 30 yuan per month and provided with accommodation, etc. If they were late for five minutes, they would be fined five jiao. They were also strongly advised not to let their parents know, so we kept our mouths shut. The ship was originally scheduled to leave at 3 PM on May 7th, so a few hours before, we wrote a quick letter to our families to inform them, thinking that by the time the letter arrived, the ship would have already left. Unexpectedly, the ship was delayed by more than ten hours, allowing our parents to catch up. As for Liang Xian, it is not difficult to find him, as he has a car with license plate number 8484. Zhou Zhengquan was also present when the contract was signed," etc. When questioned, Zhou Zhengquan stated that when the contract was signed, the two girls said that there was no one at home, so he did not ask their parents to come to the scene. The court reviewed the statements and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for further summonses.</p>
<h3>Female Guest at the Oriental Hotel Takes Poison; Male Guest Disappears; Female Guest's Life in Danger</h3>
<p>At the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road Racecourse, around 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, a male and female guest arrived and booked room 472 on the fourth floor. The male guest claimed to be named Li Jun, 28 years old, a local. The next morning, as dawn was breaking, the male guest dressed and left, leaving only the female guest sleeping alone in the room. At noon, the waiter went to knock on the door to ask if the room was to be continued. The female guest got up, dressed, and gave the waiter a five-yuan note as payment for the second day's room fee. After receiving the note, the waiter politely left. By 5 PM, the floor waiter heard moaning sounds coming from the room. He quickly tried to pry open the door and saw the female guest with a pale face and white foam coming from her mouth. Knowing that she had taken poison, he immediately reported it to the Old Gate Patrol, who sent patrolman number 173 to take her to Renji Hospital in an ambulance. Her life is said to be in danger. The female guest had a nine-gold ring on her hand engraved with the words "Huifang," and she was wearing a sauce-colored Indian silk cheongsam with flowers. There were fifteen yuan in banknotes in her pocket.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing and Others Plan to Organize a Jiangbei Trust Farm; To Be Formally Established After Chen Gongbo Returns to Shanghai; Tonghai Railway to Begin Construction Between July and August This Year</h3>
<p>Shen Shi She reported that Rong Zongjing, a prominent industrialist in this city, and Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, etc., recognizing the vastness of Jiangbei's land and the abundance of its resources, regretted that they could not be fully developed, resulting in goods being abandoned on the land. They jointly organized the Jiangbei Coastal Trust Group Farm with various circles in Jiangbei to engage in operation and investment. A reporter from Shen Shi She specially recorded the following information:</p>
<h3>Farm to Be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Industry had previously drafted plans for the development of Jiangbei's rich resources, but the plans were suspended due to a lack of funds. Later, Rong Zongjing and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, etc., discussed and agreed to jointly establish a trust group farm, and with the support of Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, they submitted a request to the Central Government for a special permit to exclusively operate all Jiangbei production undertakings and all coastal agricultural water conservancy projects. Rong has now properly negotiated the funding part. After Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo returns to the country early next month, it can be formally established.</p>
<h3>Construction of the Tonghai Railway</h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Tonghai Railway as the first step in the plan to prosper Jiangbei, the total cost of 17 million yuan will be borne separately by the Coastal Trust Farm and the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The entire line is more than 470 kilometers long, passing through Dongtai, Rugao, Yancheng, Funing, Lianshui, Huaiyin, Suqian, Shuyang, and Guanyun from the south to reach Haizhou, connecting with the Longhai Railway. Rong and the Jiangsu Provincial Government have separately borrowed funds from Sino-foreign banks in Beijing and Shanghai, and a contract will be signed soon. Construction can begin around July at the latest. In the future, the completion of this road will greatly benefit the development of Jiangbei's rich resources.</p>

<h3>Lixing and Zhaoshang Bureaus' Shanghai-Lake Liners Robbed by Bandits; Inland River Shipping Association Requests Strict Apprehension</h3>
<p>On the 25th of this month, the Lishun steamer of the Lixing Shipping Bureau at 612 North Suzhou Road, returning to Shanghai from the lake, was passing through the Zhangjiabangkou area, the border between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, at around 1 AM that night, when suddenly two bandit boats came, with about ten bandits speaking local dialects, firing guns and boarding the ship, rampaging and robbing. After about an hour, they left with shouts. As a result, more than ten packages of goods from Hongxin Factory, Shengtai, Tongfeng, etc., as well as miscellaneous account funds and clothing in the accounting room, were robbed. On the same day, at around 11 PM that night, the Liji steamer of the Inland River Zhaoshang Shipping Bureau at 546 North Suzhou Road, also encountered more than ten bandits speaking local dialects while passing through the same area on its way from the lake to Shanghai. After checking, it was found that a couple of passengers had a handbag robbed, containing many new silk clothes, and two gold watches were robbed from their hands. Zhou Shaotang and Feng Yuequan, silk merchants from Shaoxing, had 43 bolts of Hangzhou silk robbed, with the He Xing mark on the bolt heads, as well as a gold ring and miscellaneous clothing. After the incidents, the two bureaus each filed a loss report and requested the industry association to forward it to the authorities for strict apprehension. It is heard that the Zhaoshang Bureau's Hengji steamer was also robbed in the same place on the 29th of last month, with losses amounting to more than 4,000 gold. The previous case of the bureau has not yet been solved, and a new case has occurred. It is unfortunate that it has been robbed twice within a month. It is heard that the Inland River Shipping Industry Association has reported the matter to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the water transport authorities of the two provinces, requesting strict apprehension.</p>
<h3>Society for the Protection of Animals Appeals for Horses</h3>
<p>The Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals, due to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's slaughter of more than 20 horses suffering from glanders, sent a letter to the bureau, stating that horses are animals, and only differ from humans in form. Human diseases can be treated, and so can animal diseases. Therefore, there is a distinction between human doctors and veterinarians. If humans suffer from severe infectious diseases, they can usually be cured after isolation and treatment, without infecting others. Moreover, in this era of advanced science and medicine, since it is known that the disease is difficult to treat, why not investigate the source of the disease and implement prevention to reduce the slaughter? Past events are of course irreparable, but future patients should pay attention to prevention. All horses should be given physical examinations and the number of annual examinations should be specified. Human diseases can be spoken of, so they can be treated early and cured. Horses cannot speak, and by the time they feel their illness, it is already too late. It is not impossible to treat. This association laments the misfortune of the sick horses and worries that our country's behavior of shooting sick horses involves scientific naivety, making us a laughingstock to foreign countries. Therefore, we offer our humble opinions and respectfully ask your bureau to deliberate and implement them.</p>

<h3>Great Model Village to Be Built Near Shanghai; China Underwear Textile and Dyeing Factory's Major Expansion Plan; Model Village and Factory Site Occupy More Than 400 Mu</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the Far East and the center of our country's politics, economy, and culture. Due to the rapid development of the city, the population has gradually increased to more than three million, and the daily increase in real estate rents has made it impossible for ordinary people to escape their difficult lives. Mr. Huang Hongjun, a maritime industrialist, determined to reduce the burden on the public and increase the joy of life, resolutely planned to purchase more than 400 mu of land in the inland area near Shanghai with convenient transportation. He planned to build a large-scale model village on 300 mu of land, with rents based on the standards for civilians, and strive to improve the facilities. All public services will be of an obligatory nature. The remaining 100 mu will be used as the factory site for the large-scale expansion of his ABC China Underwear Textile and Dyeing Factory. What is most noteworthy is that all shareholders of the factory's 300 shares can enjoy the land in the model village. Huang, in order to promote the realization of the plan and gather ideas, hosted a banquet at the Dongya Restaurant yesterday for people from all walks of life. After listening to Mr. Huang's speech, more than 100 guests discussed it one after another, and everyone rose up to promote the realization of the great model village. The following is the record of Huang Hongjun's speech: "I lived in the United States for more than 20 years since I was a child, studying textile by working and studying. After returning to China, I founded ABC China Underwear Textile Factory with 20,000 yuan in the ninth year of the Republic of China. For fifteen years, I have been operating diligently, and I am honored to occupy a position in the national goods industry. However, foreign goods are dumped, and the import deficit increases year by year. Therefore, I decided to plan a large-scale expansion, planning to increase shares by 1.4 million yuan, combined with the original 600,000 yuan of shares, to raise 2 million yuan. It is estimated that 1 million yuan will be used to add a yarn factory and improve the equipment of textile and dyeing machines, 500,000 yuan will be used to expand the distribution office into a department store, and 500,000 yuan will be used to open an ABC bank. Because I see that the trend of Shanghai's development will become a purely commercial area, its factories and residences will inevitably be forced to move. There are precedents for this in New York and Chicago. Therefore, I purchased more than 400 mu of land near Shanghai, using 100 mu as the permanent foundation for expanding the factory and more than 300 mu to build a great model village to meet the needs of the public who are forced to leave the city. In order to promote the realization of the solicitation cooperation, anyone who purchases 300 shares of this company can enjoy a quarter of the land in the model village, 500 shares can enjoy seven points, and 1,000 shares can enjoy 1.5 mu, so that they can invest in a solid industry that has been established and create a permanent foundation for future generations. When we are well-off, it is easy to buy 3,000 to 5,000 yuan of shares and build a house of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan on the land in the model village. It is also a pleasure in life to take our wife and children to live in a spacious and fresh village during holidays. It must be known that human affairs are uncertain and change endlessly. Once we fail or even go bankrupt, we can wait in the village and seek other developments. If we look at this kind of thinking from a long-term perspective, we will naturally feel fearful and take precautions before things happen and make plans for retreat as early as possible. Furthermore, people are social animals, and mutual assistance and cooperation are valuable in life, but the sea is a den of all evils, and deception and fraud can be suffered anytime and anywhere, especially for the old, weak, widowed, and young. If you are a shareholder of this company and live in the model village, this company will definitely pay attention to protecting and instructing everything. The management in the village is strict, so that there will be no bad people mixed in it, so that the spirit of true mutual assistance, cooperation, unity, and contact can be achieved, and you can live and work in peace. Although this company may also suffer the misfortune of failure, it must be known that if the company fails, someone will take it over. Those who work in the factory do not need to worry, because those who take over mostly only change the important officials of the company."</p>

<h3>Red Swastika Society Plans Disaster Relief in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Previously, due to the military disaster in Fujian Province, the World Red Swastika Society specially sent two South China Relief Teams, advancing by land and water, to implement relief, and organized a wounded soldier hospital in Fuzhou, as well as handling emergency relief in various disaster areas. For several months, it rescued more than a thousand wounded soldiers and provided assistance to more than two thousand refugees. Since the recovery of Fujian, the society's relief team has converted two clinics to provide relief to civilians, with hundreds of people seeking medical treatment every day. It is now heard that the society has received reports from the relief team that the disaster areas in various recovered counties have been devastated, with people displaced and homeless. The recent catastrophe in Yong'an was particularly tragic. The society specially appointed the two presidents, Han Fuhang and Zhao Daoci, as well as Yuan Shanjin, Zhang Guanshan, Song Benxin, Wang Yuanxing, and other gentlemen, to take the Huaan Wheel of the Chang'an Company to Fujian on the 27th to conduct on-the-spot investigations and inspect the relief situation in order to prepare a unified plan.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Liu Shufan Case</h3>
<p>The case of former Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Liu Shufan, and others, who were accused of offenses, was concluded yesterday by the First Special District Court. As previously reported in this newspaper, the case is divided into two parts: (1) the part concerning Ren Sida, the manager of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Branch during Liu Shufan's tenure, who handled the collection of public bonds on behalf of the Xunji account; (2) the part concerning Yang Jianping's tenure, involving Zhao Baoshan, Yang Peichang, and others, for allegedly receiving huge commissions by inflating land prices during land purchases. Prosecutor Zhong Qing first stated the circumstances of the investigation to the court. Regarding Liu Shufan's part, he said that if the defendant could provide evidence proving that Xunji was definitely not Liu's, he could be acquitted; otherwise, he would be considered criminally liable. Regarding Yang Jianping's part, he believed that the property prices reported by the defendant and the commissions received were excessive and inconsistent with reason. If the defendant could not prove that such practices were customary in the market, he should bear corresponding responsibility. Subsequently, the defense lawyers of each defendant presented witnesses and material evidence to argue on behalf of their clients. Liu Shufan himself argued for the longest time, until 7 p.m., when it finally ended. The court scheduled the verdict for next Saturday. Liu stated that because he grew up in Fujian and his accent might cause misunderstandings, he was afraid that listeners would not fully understand him. Therefore, he submitted a written statement to the court to be included in the record. The original statement is attached below for public viewing.</p>
<p>The first point of the accusation against the defendant is that he used the alias Xunji to embezzle savings funds and operate public bonds. Fortunately, the presiding judge went to the Savings and Remittance Bureau to verify the various counter-evidence presented by the defendant, and it was all found to be accurate. At the same time, many materials beneficial to the defendant were also discovered. In addition, there was a letter from Minister Wang Boqun, an investigation by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the testimony of Manager Ren Sida, all of which proved that Xunji had no connection with the defendant. With both documentary and witness evidence available, Shufan need not argue much on this point. As for the deposit in Liu Jianhou's name, it is certified by Minister Wang's letter and the deposit certificate of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. This 100,000 taels belonged to Xunji and was definitely not Shufan's money, without any doubt. At that time, Wang Boqun entrusted Shufan to keep this money for his friend, but for the sake of caution, he added an extra layer of protection. Shufan immediately deposited the money into the branch and handed over the checkbook and deposit book to Manager Ren Sida for safekeeping. Because Xunji directly contacted Ren himself, all the books were also handed over to him. At that time, he also instructed him to bring the check for signature when he bought public bonds, so as not to mistakenly repay the money. Please refer to Manager Ren Sida's testimony in court on April 27, which can prove that this was a private friendship entrustment. Minister Wang Boqun did not use his position as a minister to order Shufan, and Shufan did not use his position as a director to order the manager. Please see Minister Wang Boqun's letter, which says that his friend directly contacted Manager Ren himself. Manager Ren Sida testified in court on April 27 that a few days before Xunji's friend handed over the money to Shufan through Minister Wang on October 20, Minister Wang had already told him about it. A few days after the money was handed over, Minister Wang used his name card to introduce his friend to Manager Ren Sida. The situation at that time was like this. Therefore, Shufan issued two checks, one for 60,000 taels and one for 40,000 taels, both made out to Ren Sida. This was all done according to the entrustor's wishes, and Shufan himself had no involvement. What Shufan knew was limited to this. As for how to contact, how to buy, how to advance money, how to pay money, and how to calculate interest, this was the business of the Shanghai branch, and Shufan did not participate in it. If we only consider the scope of my defense, then it can end here. However, the second point of the prosecutor's accusation is the short collection of interest, a total of 350 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, which harmed the country. Although this is not within Shufan's scope, for the sake of discussing the facts, Shufan will also make a slight statement on this. Failure to collect the money that should be collected is called a loss. Failure to collect the money that should not be collected cannot be called a loss. Interest is only collected after money is advanced. There is no interest to be collected if there is no actual advance. At that time, Xunji had already deposited 100,000 taels on October 20. On November 23, they began to purchase public bonds. The Shanghai branch did not use the money deposited by Xunji first, and some of the money subsequently deposited by Xunji was recorded in the temporary account book and some in the savings sub-account, which were not immediately offset. This affected the amount of the advance and the calculation of interest. For example, the highest amount of the advance was only over 80,000 yuan. At that time, Xunji still had public bond tickets worth over 230,000 yuan stored in the bureau. How could there be an advance of over 400,000? However, just looking at the matter itself, the money deposited by Xunji, no matter how the bank recorded it in its books or how it offset the accounts, should be considered as their own deposit, ready to buy bonds, and should be used first. Only then can the payment be called an advance. Later, every time Xunji deposited one yuan, the advance decreased by one yuan. If the bank, due to its own accounting, did not care whether the customer had deposited money first and wanted to charge one cent of interest per yuan, and the money deposited by the customer earlier, a huge amount (about 90,000 yuan), did not earn any interest, it would not make sense in business. If the customer could not accept such a method, then it should not be charged and should not be considered a loss. This situation is very clear from looking at the account books. The prosecutor's so-called short collection of 350 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, and Manager Ren Sida's so-called overcollection, are both on this point. Manager Ren has already explained in detail, and my defense lawyer, Liu, has also explained. Furthermore, regarding the issue of uncollected handling fees, Xunji did pay handling fees, because the Savings Bureau entrusted it to its broker. The money was taken away by its broker. If the Savings Bureau charged another layer of handling fees, wouldn't it be like not wanting to do business? As for the guarantee deposit, because the affairs of the branch were not handled by Shufan personally, he could not know the details, so he said he was not clear. Now, after accompanying the judge to the branch to check the accounts, he can understand. This time, the branch purchased public bonds on behalf of Xunji with cash for immediate delivery, not speculative trading on the exchange. The Savings Bureau acted on behalf of Xunji, exchanging money for goods. How could there be a guarantee deposit? The bureau had already earned over 5,900 yuan, which cannot be said to be insignificant. Based on the facts, Shufan and Ren Sida did not commit any crimes and made no mistakes. The branch manager was in charge of all business matters. Shufan, as the director-general, dares to state the whole story at this final hearing opportunity to clarify the truth. Looking at the mortgage made by Xunji, Manager Ren only calculated 60% of the actual value of the collateral, and the interest rate was still two cents. Whether Xunji received preferential treatment or not, it is self-evident without arguing. Therefore, Shufan said in the investigation court on March 8 that the people who handled Xunji's interest rates and so on had already dispersed and could not investigate the situation at that time in detail. Based on the information obtained, Ren Sida was actually too harsh on Xunji. Please check the file to see.</p>

<h3>24 Tobacco Merchants Request Revision of Tax Rate; Tax Bureau Clarifies Errors in Tobacco Merchant Statistics (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>(7) The original review opinion's calculation of customs duties is inaccurate. The original review stated that after the implementation of the two-tier tax, imported cigarettes were manufactured domestically, and customs revenue was sharply reduced compared to before, and compiled a "Statistics Table of Import Quantity, Value and Tax Revenue of Imported Cigarettes at Customs", stating that the customs tariff for imported cigarettes was revised to 50% gold units in the 20th year of the Republic. At that time, the procedures stipulated that the collection should be divided, i.e., 10% should be collected by customs according to the tax regulations in gold units, and the other 40% should be collected by the former Unified Tax Bureau according to the Unified Tax Regulations. After November of the 20th year, imported cigarettes were changed to be collected by customs according to the tax regulations in full gold units, and the unified tax portion was temporarily exempted. The import quantity of imported cigarettes from the 20th to the 22nd year and the actual tax revenue are as follows, according to the reply from the Director-General of Customs:</p>
<p>Year Quantity (boxes) Total Value (gold units) Tax Revenue (gold units) Year Compared to the reduced revenue in the 20th year</p>
<p>20th year 5,876,443 11,093,885 6,464,086 21st year 4,964,960</p>
<p>21st year 1,362,842 2,952,710 2,499,126 22nd year 5,858,398</p>
<p>22nd year 500,626 1,394,352 605,688</p>
<p>(1) National Import Quantity Table of Various Cigarettes from the 20th to the 22nd year</p>
<p>Year Type Number of Cigarettes per Box Import Quantity Estimated Value in Gold Units</p>
<p>20th year Cigarettes 500 5,884,768 boxes 2,138,318 yuan</p>
<p>Cigars 50 170,060 boxes 510,832 yuan</p>
<p>21st year Cigarettes 500 1,362,842 boxes 2,924,710 yuan</p>
<p>Cigars 50 82,515 boxes 245,877 yuan</p>
<p>22nd year Cigarettes 500 500,622 boxes 1,394,352 yuan</p>
<p>Cigars 50 108,313 boxes 276,344 yuan</p>
<p>Year Month Tax Revenue of Each Port in the East Province in Gold Units Tax Revenue of Other Ports in Gold Units Year Total in Gold Units</p>
<p>February to October of the 20th year 50,383.76 yuan 1,168,491.12 yuan February to October of the 20th year 1,218,874.88 yuan</p>
<p>November to December of the 20th year 2,186.50 yuan 185,078.55 yuan October to December of the 20th year 187,260.05 yuan</p>
<p>21st year 31,293.68 yuan 1,105,732.12 yuan 21st year 1,137,025.80 yuan</p>
<p>22nd year None 581,781.62 yuan 22nd year 583,781.62 yuan</p>
<p>Comparing the above two tables with the statistics table in the original review, the numbers in the import quantity, value, and tax revenue columns in the original statistics table are all inaccurate. According to the table from the Director-General of Customs, the February to October column in the 20th year is the 10% gold unit customs duty collected by customs according to the above-mentioned method of dividing the collection of imported tobacco tax. The November to December column in the 20th year is the 50% gold unit customs duty collected by customs at the end of that year. Therefore, the actual customs duty revenue of imported cigarettes in the 20th year, including the three eastern provinces, totaled 1,406,134.93 gold units. The original review, due to misunderstanding the customs duty collection procedures in the 20th year, mistakenly calculated that the cigarette customs duty in the 20th year was 6,464,086 gold units. The calculation of the customs duty numbers in the 21st and 22nd years based on this error is naturally also inevitably erroneous. It should be noted that the gradual decrease in the import of imported cigarettes did not start in the 21st year when the two-tier tax was implemented. Even during the seven-tier tax in the 17th and 18th years, it had already decreased year by year. According to the General Customs Trade Register and Statistical Yearbook, the import of imported cigarettes in the 17th year was 9,543,574 boxes, in the 18th year it was 8,136,325 boxes, and in the 19th year it was 6,223,739 boxes. According to the Director-General of Customs table this time, it was 5,884,786 boxes in the 20th year, 1,362,842 boxes in the 21st year, and 500,626 boxes in the 22nd year. It can be seen that the import quantity of imported cigarettes decreased year by year during the periods of the Unified Tax implementing the seven-tier, three-tier, and two-tier taxes. Even if the Unified Tax changes the tiers again, it will not be able to restore the previous import quantity, which can be asserted. In summary, the statistics cited in the original report are wrong. The so-called benefits of foreign merchants, losses of Chinese merchants, and losses of government tax revenue are fundamentally untenable, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the tobacco factory, etc., initially claimed that the tax treatment was unfair and advocated that there should be an equal increase for high- and medium-grade cigarettes to show impartiality. Keeping the 80 yuan first tier unchanged would not harm government tax revenue. If the increase is calculated progressively, it can indeed benefit Chinese merchants, which can be considered for change. However, in their proposal, they also advocated that the current tax system, which collects 80 yuan per box of low-grade cigarettes, should be reduced, and they recognized the seven-tier tax system as the principle of fair taxation, which is tantamount to requesting a reduction in the low-grade tax rate. Regardless of whether the tobacco factory, etc., have inconsistent purposes, given the current financial difficulties of the government, the serious national crisis, and the need for funds for bandit suppression and construction everywhere, the tax increase has just been implemented, so how can it be easily reduced? This is difficult to adopt in practice. At the beginning of the implementation of the cigarette Unified Tax, it was originally a seven-tier tax system. Later, most manufacturers, due to the rising price of gold, increased raw material prices, tight tax tiers, and strict sales price restrictions, which hindered business, proposed changing to a three-tier tax system to relax the sales price restrictions. The government, considering that the request was reasonable, and that it could increase tax revenue, naturally took into account the business situation and changed to the three-tier tax system. Later, the government needed funds and proposed increasing taxes again. Most Chinese merchants, due to poor business, requested that the price limits be relaxed again. Therefore, the consensus was adopted to change back to the two-tier tax system. The tax rate was increased in December of last year, originally as a last resort due to the urgent need for funds by the government, but the tax system remained the same and was not changed. The tax system can indeed be adapted to the times, but it should be based on increasing revenue and benefiting merchants. If this request from the manufacturers, etc., is for the benefit of the majority and does not affect the original tax revenue, it should be thoroughly examined by the general assembly, and a proposal should be submitted to increase the tiers for high-grade cigarettes as appropriate. If it is said that the seven-tier tax is the most suitable, then why did the manufacturers not have a vital stake at that time and have to request changes and relief? Moreover, the tier change has been going on for more than three years, and the business of each factory has indeed developed more than before. Therefore, the claim of these manufacturers has been hindered and changed in the past. Now, they are picking up the old system and attempting to reduce taxes, which is somewhat conservative. Moreover, it is not the claim of all tobacco factories, but only that a few manufacturers believe that the poor business of their own is due to the poor tax system. They use incorrect statistics and make one-sided propaganda, which is enough to affect the business of legitimate tobacco merchants and government tax revenue. We must correct it based on the facts. There are many enlightened people among the tobacco merchants. We sincerely hope that they will strive to unite, actively reorganize their businesses, and not be misled by rumors of tax reduction, which would hinder their own interests. This is our earnest hope. This is a special explanation.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Military Interference in Traffic; Notices from the Ministry of Military Affairs Posted at the North and South Stations of the Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs posted notices at the North and South Stations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, stating: For the purpose of notice, according to the official letter from the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission, approved by the letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways reported that military personnel often interfere with traffic at various stations. Although the stationmasters and staff have kindly persuaded them and explained that arbitrary traffic can easily cause major disasters, they still ignore them. It should be requested to forward the report to the Central Government to order the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue a notice to all military units not to interfere with traffic and to issue a notice for protection. After transferring it to the Ministry, it was found that the military is not allowed to interfere with traffic, and a ban has already been issued. Now, according to the previous report, in addition to issuing another order to guide, this notice is hereby issued to all troops to know. Hereafter, when taking the train, do not interfere with traffic. If you dare to violate, you will be severely investigated and will not be forgiven. Be sure to know. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Deputy Minister Cao Haosen.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed Incident Involving Villagers in Western Shanghai; Two People Seriously Injured by Knives</h3>
<p>Xu Jiadi, a local, is 31 years old and works as a chauffeur for Sassoon &amp; Co. on Suzhou Road. The company's manager purchased dozens of acres of land at No. 535 Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, next to the cricket field, and built a garden. There are also two patrol police stationed inside. Therefore, Xu Adi and his employer often went there to play. Yesterday was Sunday, and Xu, around 11 a.m., invited his colleague Zhang Guifu (also a driver at Sassoon &amp; Co., 27 years old), Zhang's brother Jin Sheng, and Xu's friend Gu Yuangao and others to the garden for lunch and to watch the New Life Movement parade on Wangmanshui Bridge. Xu Adi and others saw that it was still early, so they went out of the garden gate and strolled west among the fields. When they walked to Xujiatai, about a mile from the garden, they somehow had a conflict with a villager, A. Then, they wrestled each other. In an instant, more and more villagers gathered, and knives, axes, and sticks were used simultaneously, causing Zhang Guifu to be slashed twice on his left shoulder, and Gu Yuangao's right hand to be chopped off by an axe, and a knife wound to his arm. Both fell in pools of blood. Zhang Jinsheng and Xu Adi suffered slightly lighter internal injuries and were not in great danger. The assailants, seeing that they had caused trouble, dispersed in a hubbub. Later, the officer Zhang Tianmin from the local police station was reported, and he sent the injured people by car to the Shanghai Sanitarium Hospital on nearby Robegen Road. After bandaging, they were transferred to the Hongkou Branch for treatment. It is said that Gu Yuangao lost too much blood and was seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Run Over by Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 6 p.m. at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, someone named A was walking through the area when a black-plated car with license plate number 770 sped towards him. Unable to dodge in time, he was knocked down by the car. The wheels ran over his head, injuring his brain. He was unconscious and on the verge of death. Western police officer No. 784 saw the incident, recorded the license plate number of the car that caused the accident, and urgently sent the injured person by car to Renji Hospital. He died within fifteen minutes due to lack of treatment. The deceased was about forty years old, wearing a single long gown of wool serge, and a shirt pocket containing one yuan and five cents in banknotes, as well as a two-cent ticket.</p>

When she returned home in the evening, she was complained about by her parents. Afterwards, Lindi was extremely resentful and secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. She was sent to Renji Hospital by car, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died shortly after. The hospital reported to the Lujiiawan General Patrol Station, ordering Officer No. 151 to come and send the body to Tongren Fuyuantang for examination.</p>

Then, they went upstairs and broke into the bedrooms of Chen Xiaosheng, a Ningbo native who lived with them, and Wang Youqing, a member of the 9th team of the Hunan District Security Corps. They rummaged through the chests and cabinets, looting 376 yuan in banknotes and foreign coins, one gold ring, one gold bracelet, and one pearl bracelet. They took the stolen goods and fled in all directions. Afterwards, the store owner, Chen Chunbo, a Fujian native, reported the situation to the 2nd Section of the 1st District, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A: Questioning the "Reading Q&amp;A Collection" (1)</h3>
<p>丨丨 One, "Why must Chinese calligraphy inevitably become an unimportant skill as social life becomes increasingly complex?"</p>
<p>丨丨 Answer Unprotected</p>
<p>On March 29th, we published a short article entitled "The Uselessness of Practicing Calligraphy." According to our investigation, this article has had a wider impact on the public than any of the discussions in this column. One reader told us that among their colleagues, sixty or seventy in number, only seven or eight normally read "Reading Q&amp;A," but this time, because the title attracted their attention, everyone read it, and not only read it, but also discussed it with each other. Several friends have already stopped copying inscriptions. Why is this? Naturally, it is not that the article itself has any higher value, but that the question has a close relationship with their practical life. They are "practicing calligraphy" every day, spending all their free time copying inscriptions, and now suddenly hearing someone say "practicing calligraphy is useless," they cannot help but be surprised and have to stop and consider: What exactly is going on!</p>
<p>We have also received many opposing opinions and skeptical questions, which shows that this issue is still worth discussing. The question raised by Mr. Zhu this time is to understand the whole process of the decline of Chinese calligraphy. Although this belongs to the realm of theory, it is beneficial to persuading everyone to stop playing this "carving insects" trick, and this discussion is precisely a supplement to the short essay "The Uselessness of Practicing Calligraphy" and is needed at this time.</p>
<p>Why do Chinese people have such a deep belief in "calligraphy"? This is not without reason. Originally, "writing" was just a symbol for "recording words and events," and its writing method really does not have much research value. Chinese people's understanding of writing exceeds its inherent meaning, which exists in the construction of Chinese characters. After "pictograms," Chinese characters did not directly embark on the path of "phonetics," which is very regrettable. It hindered the evolution of Chinese characters, and it has only remained in the direct line of painting until now. However, it has endowed Chinese characters with artistry, and calligraphy has become a special art. Writing has raised its prestige, and it has become a special type of art in the feudal era, used as a means of restraint for scholars, and has been crazy for thousands of years. This kind of art naturally belongs to the aristocracy. Calligraphers of ancient and modern times are often high-ranking officials and nobles at the same time. The cultivation of this art requires leisurely free time and a bright and clean environment, and it is certainly not accessible to people who do not even know how to write and are busy all day long. Speaking of its artistic value, apart from the function of writing itself to record words and events, it does not have the functions of painting, music, etc. to cultivate temperament, regulate emotions, and express life emotions. It only has a kind of formal beauty and cannot write the tragedies and comedies of the world. Can you get a sense of life from a famous master's handwriting? That is absolutely impossible. Therefore, even from the artistic point of view itself, this art also has certain limits. It does not have the future of painting.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decline of Chinese calligraphy and the decline of feudal forces are proceeding in parallel, which is not accidental. With the decline of feudal forces, this tool of restraining scholars has gradually lost its meaning. Since China has entered the stage of modernization, the knowledge required by social life in this era is more serious than in any era or any country in the past. This drastic change is reflected in "writing," that is, Chinese characters are required to break out of that artistic type and return to "recording words and events," only seeking quick application, and no longer needing to emulate the ancients.</p>
<p>We can see this historical process clearly since the establishment of the new Chinese education system. The calligraphy course in schools is now only listed on the curriculum of primary schools. Its role is completely different from before. Calligraphers are also increasingly declining. People from new schools, except for some literary predecessors, rarely play this "carving insects" trick anymore. Only a part of the old remnants are still playing with this "antique character" to spend their remaining years. Its fate will naturally be extinguished together with the remnants of the previous era. (Of course, it can still retain historical value.)</p>
<p>From the perspective of social life, China has now entered the stage of applying typewriters. Large companies have adopted typewriters, and the daily use of fountain pens and pencils by office workers is gradually replacing brushes. Therefore, "writing" only seeks speed and agility, and does not require "imitating the ancients" and being detached from vulgarity. In stores, we have seen a kind of simplified script, which is being used in the vast commercial fields of various provinces; low-level drum lyrics, scripts, and novels have also been used for a long time. What does this show? This has foreshadowed the transformation of Chinese characters and has already begun in real life.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese National Phonetic Alphabet has not yet become something like the Japanese kana, making Chinese characters leap into a new stage, the occurrence of this movement is undoubtedly the beginning of the awareness of the transformation of Chinese characters. The National Phonetic Alphabet movement failed, and this failure was because it did not grasp the full meaning of transforming writing. It only started from the national phonetics, ignoring the "form and meaning" parts. Although it seems that the transformation of writing has been very depressed in recent years, it is not actually the case. For example, the creation of new characters in translation and science, and the application of simplified characters by the general public all indicate the transformation of Chinese characters. Chinese characters are now demanding to embark on the path of "phonetics."</p>
<p>This is a little leaf depiction of the declining process of Chinese calligraphy. I think this will help Mr. Zhu understand why Chinese calligraphy has become an unimportant skill to some extent!</p>
<p>Finally, we must add a little more. "The Uselessness of Practicing Calligraphy" has never opposed people practicing characters for application. However, you can pay attention to it when you have the opportunity to write something. You don't have to spend the entire precious spare time on this skill. It is true that there are still people who are fascinated by the art of writing in today's society. Most of our father's generation, who were left over from the previous era, are still worried about the saints and fear that "civilization will be swept away," and are desperately educating their descendants to study calligraphy intensively. You should politely decline their advice. You should follow the vanguard of the times and prepare the knowledge and skills you should have in your life.</p>

<h3>On Typhoid Fever - Part Two (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Yu Xueshou</p>
<p>I have examined the beginning and end of the twelve meridians and learned the general outline of their Yin and Yang names. For example, what is called Yang is all on the outer side, what is called Yin is all on the inner side, what is called Yang is mostly on the back of the hands and feet, what is called Yin is mostly in the center of the hands and feet. The little fingers of the hands and feet, the outermost part of the outer side, the pulse starts and ends here and runs along the outer side, is called Taiyang, such as the Taiyang meridian of the small intestine of the hand, which starts at the end of the little finger, runs along the outer side of the hand, the Taiyang meridian of the bladder of the foot, which comes out behind the outer ankle, runs along the Jing bone, to the outer side of the little finger, the tendon of the Taiyang of the hand, which starts above the little finger, and the tendon of the Taiyang of the foot, which starts above the little finger, are all examples. Therefore, Taiyang means the outermost. The next is between the little finger and the next finger, the pulse starts and ends here and runs along the outer side, is called Shaoyang, such as the Shaoyang meridian of the Sanjiao of the hand, which starts between the little finger and the next finger, the Shaoyang meridian of the gallbladder of the foot, which runs along the instep of the foot, enters between the little finger and the next finger, the tendon of the Shaoyang of the hand, which starts at the end of the little finger and the next finger, and the tendon of the Shaoyang of the foot, which starts above the little finger and the next finger, are all examples. Therefore, Shaoyang means the next outermost. The next is that it starts and ends inside the middle finger, but the path followed by its tendons and meridians is still on the outer side, is called Yangming, such as the Yangming meridian of the large intestine of the hand, which starts at the end of the next finger of the thumb··enters the outer elbow, the upper outer front of the arm, the Yangming meridian of the stomach of the foot, which runs down the outer side of the tibia, down the instep of the foot, enters the inner side of the middle finger, the tendon of the Yangming of the hand, which starts at the end of the next finger of the thumb, knots on the wrist, runs along the arm, and knots on the outer elbow, the tendon of the Yangming of the foot, which starts at the middle three fingers, knots on the instep of the foot, obliquely outwards and upwards, adds to the auxiliary bone, and knots on the outer side of the knee, the tendon of the Yangming of the hand, which starts at the end of the next finger of the thumb··knots on the outer elbow, the tendon of the Yangming of the foot, which starts at the middle three fingers, knots on the instep of the foot, obliquely outwards and upwards, adds to the auxiliary bone, and knots on the outer side of the knee, are all examples.</p>
<p>The thumb is the innermost of the inner side, the pulse starts and ends here and runs along the inner side, is called Taiyin, such as the Taiyin meridian of the lung of the hand, which runs along the inner arm, the lower side of the upper bone, enters the Cunkou, the upper fish, runs along the fish, comes out of the end of the thumb, the Taiyin meridian of the spleen of the foot, which starts at the end of the thumb, runs along the inner side of the finger,··the upper front of the inner ankle, the inner tibia behind the upper instep··the inner front of the upper knee thigh, are all examples, the tendon of the Taiyin of the hand, which starts above the thumb, the tendon of the Taiyin of the foot, which starts at the end of the thumb on the inner side, are all examples, the next is inside the thumb, the pulse starts and ends here and runs along the inner side, is called Jueyin, such as the Jueyin meridian of the pericardium of the hand, which runs along the inner arm, between Taiyin and Shaoyin,··runs along the middle finger, comes out of its end, the Jueyin meridian of the liver of the foot, which starts at the base of the thumb, runs up the upper side of the instep of the foot, one inch away from the inner ankle, although this starts at the thumb with the Taiyin of the spleen of the foot, but the Taiyin of the spleen of the foot runs along the inner side of the finger, this starts at the base, which is more outer than the spleen meridian, so it is Jueyin, the tendon of the pericardium of the hand, which starts at the middle finger, runs parallel with the tendon of Taiyin, knots on the inner elbow, the tendon of the Jueyin of the foot, which starts above the thumb, knots on the front of the inner ankle, are all examples, the next is the little finger, the pulse starts and ends here and its path still runs along the inner side of the hand, is called Shaoyin, such as the Shaoyin meridian of the heart of the hand, which enters the inner back of the palm, runs along the inner side of the little finger, comes out of its end, the Shaoyin meridian of the kidney of the foot, which starts below the little finger, obliquely goes to the center of the foot, comes out below the Rangu, runs behind the inner ankle, the tendon of the Shaoyin of the hand, which starts on the inner side of the little finger, knots on the sharp bone, knots on the inner elbow, the tendon of the Shaoyin of the foot, which starts below the little finger, runs parallel with the tendon of the Taiyin of the foot, obliquely goes below the inner ankle, knots on the heel, are all examples, from this point of view, the meridians that run on the outer side of the hands and feet are all called Yang, the one that starts and ends at the outermost is called Taiyang, the next is Shaoyang, the next is Yangming, the meridians that run on the inner side of the hands and feet are all called Yin, the one that starts and ends at the innermost is called Taiyin, the next is Jueyin, the next is Shaoyin, if this method is used to name them, then the so-called theory of two Yangs combining with Ming and two Yins intersecting will be incomprehensible,</p>
<p>What has been said above is that the names of the six meridians of the hands and feet are incomprehensible. As for the diseases of the six meridians, it is even more strange. The Ling Shu Jing Mai Pian and Jing Jin Pian list the diseases of the twelve meridians of the hands and feet, but the final chapter of the Zhōng Shǐ Piān only mentions the names of the six meridians such as Taiyang and Yangming, without explicitly mentioning the hands and feet. However, the detailed symptoms are those of the six meridians of the foot. The names of the six meridians such as Juyang and Yangming mentioned in the Su Wen Re Lun Piān do not explicitly mention the hands and feet, but the detailed symptoms are also those of the six meridians of the foot. The Shang Han Lun of Zhang Zhongjing only mentions the names of the six meridians such as Taiyang and Yangming, without explicitly mentioning the hands and feet, but the detailed symptoms are also those of the six meridians of the foot. Therefore, the ancients had the saying that typhoid fever is transmitted to the feet but not to the hands. Zhang Jingyue said that this statement was created by Liu Caochuang, but Zhu Taiyi's Huoren Shu has clearly stated it. Later, those who debated it arose in droves, Liu Hejian spoke of it in the front, Tao Jiean discussed it in the back, and Zhang Jingyue, Fang Zhongxing, Wei Litong, Min Zhiqing, and Ke Yunbo argued endlessly, without agreeing on one thing. Now, please list the main points below to see that the ancients' empty words are useless and unfounded words are not credible.</p>
<h3>General Knowledge About Body Temperature</h3>
<p>— Wu Bintao</p>
<p>Our body normally maintains a certain temperature, which is the body temperature. The thermometer used to check body temperature is called a clinical thermometer. The body temperature of a normal healthy person is between 36 and 37 degrees Celsius. The body temperature of children is slightly higher, with an average of 37.5 degrees. The body temperature of elderly people over 70 years old is about 36 degrees. The above are all healthy body temperatures. Being able to maintain this certain healthy body temperature will not change permanently unless health is broken.</p>
<p>Healthy body temperature often has very slight increases or decreases due to various reasons. For example, body temperature is slightly lower in the morning and slightly higher in the afternoon. Also, nervous excitement and after eating can increase body temperature. Therefore, healthy body temperature inevitably has slight increases or decreases, but the degree of increase or decrease does not exceed one degree. If it is found that body temperature gradually decreases to below 36 degrees, or that body temperature gradually increases to above 37 degrees, it is sufficient to prove that the health of the body has been</p>
<p>destroyed and a state of illness is present.</p>
<p>If the body temperature is above 37 degrees, it is called fever. The degree of fever is divided into six types:</p>
<p>Subfebrile 丨丨 Between 37 degrees and 38 degrees.</p>
<p>Mild fever 丨丨 Between 38 degrees and 38.4 degrees.</p>
<p>Moderate fever 丨丨 In the morning, it is from 38.5 degrees to 39 degrees; in the evening, it increases to 39.5 degrees.</p>
<p>High fever 丨丨 In the morning, it is above 39.5 degrees, and in the evening, it also tends to exceed 40.5 degrees.</p>
<p>Terminal fever 丨丨 The body temperature rises to above 42 degrees, or drops to below 33 degrees, often leading to death.</p>
<p>When checking body temperature, first hold the clinical thermometer tightly by hand and shake it to lower the mercury pointer. Then insert it under the armpit, and have the examinee clamp it tightly with their arm. After about 10 to 15 minutes, the clinical thermometer can be taken out to observe the body temperature indicated on the thermometer. It goes without saying that if there is sweat under the armpit, it should be wiped dry first. Although the armpit is the most common site for checking body temperature, it can also be checked from the mouth, groin, anus, or armpit when necessary.</p>
<p>The number of times body temperature is checked is usually three times a day: once around 7:00 AM, once around 3:00 PM, and once around 9:00 PM. If necessary, it is more appropriate to increase or decrease the number of times body temperature is checked.</p>
<p>The different states of fever, that is, the different types of fever, are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  If the difference between the temperature in the morning and the evening is within one degree, it is generally remittent fever. Typhoid fever and pneumonia are all remittent fever.</p>
<p>2.  If the difference between the temperature in the morning and the evening is more than one degree but less than two degrees, it is called intermittent fever. Sepsis and abscesses all develop intermittent fever.</p>
<p>3.  If the temperature is normal in the morning (that is, a healthy body temperature, around 37 degrees), but rises to 39 degrees or even 40 degrees in the evening, it is called hectic fever. Pulmonary tuberculosis is one example.</p>
<p>4.  If the fever occurs every other day, and the body temperature is normal when there is no fever, it is called intermittent fever. Malaria is this type of fever.</p>
<p>5.  A type of fever that mixes intermittent fever and remittent fever is called relapsing fever. For example, relapsing fever. It is very rare in China.</p>
<p>There are also various specialized terms for fever. The more common ones are: the change in body temperature throughout the day, that is, the difference between the highest and lowest points of temperature, is called the daily difference. The gradual increase in temperature day by day is called the stage of increasing heat, and when the temperature increases to the point where it can no longer increase, it is called the peak of heat. If the disease gradually heals, or the death is the outcome, then the body temperature decreases, which is called the dissipation period of heat. Because the disease is cured, and the high fever completely disappears and returns to a healthy body temperature in one day, it is specially named defervescence. The slow defervescence is specially called heat dissipation. If a fever that has already been deferredvesced recurs after some time, it is called pseudo-defervescence of fever.</p>
<p>The most commonly used thermometers are Celsius and Fahrenheit. The body temperature mentioned in this article is all Celsius. However, the temperature of Celsius and Fahrenheit thermometers can be converted into each other using the following formula.</p>
<p>(1) Convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius</p>
<p>Subtract 32 degrees from the measured Fahrenheit temperature, then multiply by 5, and divide by 9 to get the result.</p>
<p>(2) Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit</p>
<p>Multiply the measured Celsius temperature by 9, divide by 5, and then add 32 degrees to get the result.</p>

<h3>Disease Knowledge Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(3000) Rabies</p>
<p>Q What is rabies?</p>
<p>A Rabies is an infectious disease caused by being bitten by an animal suffering from this disease.</p>
<p>Q Is the animal suffering from this disease limited to dogs?</p>
<p>A Most are dogs; but there are also cats, cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. that suffer from it.</p>
<p>Q What is the pathogen of this disease?</p>
<p>A The pathogen is unknown, but the virus gradually reaches the central part along the nerve fibers; therefore, the closer the bitten part is to the central nervous system, the faster the onset.</p>
<p>Q Will a person develop the disease immediately after being bitten by an animal with rabies?</p>
<p>A No. It must go through half a month to a month</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>of incubation period before developing the disease.</p>
<p>Q What are the symptoms when the disease develops?</p>
<p>A The onset of the disease can be divided into three stages.</p>
<p>Q What are the symptoms of the first stage?</p>
<p>A The first stage is the melancholic stage, also called the prodromal stage. Initially, there is pain and abnormal sensation in the bitten part; gradually, it spreads to the surrounding parts, the lymph glands swell, and at the same time, it falls into a melancholic state, and is indifferent to everything outside. However, sometimes it shows an unstable state and goes out and wanders around. The body temperature rises slightly. This stage usually lasts two to five days.</p>
<p>Q What are the symptoms of the second stage?</p>
<p>A The second stage is the development stage, also called the hydrophobia stage. Spasms occur in the respiratory stage and the swallowing stage. There is irregular breathing and wheezing. Spasms have already occurred when swallowing liquids or simply seeing liquids. Therefore, this disease also has the name of hydrophobia. Sometimes there are convulsions in the limbs and trunk muscles, coupled with uneasiness, excitement, and delirium, which later become mania. The body temperature rises more and more, reaching 40 degrees Celsius. Before death, there is excessive fever, rapid and irregular pulse, and rapid breathing. This stage usually lasts one to three days.</p>
<p>Q What are the symptoms of the third stage?</p>
<p>A The third stage is the paralysis stage. Various symptoms disappear, and then food and drink are advanced, but paralysis of the whole body muscles occurs, and death occurs in a few hours to more than ten hours.</p>
<p>Q Are there any exceptional symptoms?</p>
<p>A Yes. Sometimes paralysis symptoms appear from the beginning, which is called silent rabies. It is mostly due to a stronger virus.</p>
<p>Q How dangerous is this rabies?</p>
<p>A Unless a preventive vaccine is injected immediately after the bite, if it is still ineffective, it is generally dangerous.</p>
<p>Q What is the treatment for rabies?</p>
<p>A The bitten part should be cauterized with a cauterizing device or fuming nitric acid. Preventive vaccination should be performed by the Pasteur method immediately after the bite.</p>
<p>Q What materials are used for Pasteur's preventive vaccination?</p>
<p>A It is made of rabies brain and spinal cord into vaccines with different toxicity, which are injected in sequence to make the bitten person's body produce substances that resist the virus, so as to avoid the onset of the disease.</p>
<p>Q What drugs are used for manic symptoms?</p>
<p>A Morphine or chloral hydrate is taken internally.</p>
<p>Q What should be done to prevent this disease?</p>
<p>A Pay attention to the health of livestock, especially dogs. If you find anything suspicious, you should kill it.</p>
<h3>On the Experience of Treating Soft Chancres: A Casual Discussion</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Shao Song</p>
<p>Chancres are divided into two types: one is called hard chancre, and the other is called soft chancre. Hard chancre is the starting point for the transmission of the syphilis spirochete. Its standard treatment is the injection of Neosalvarsan or SulfoˉTiepaisenano (Neo-Salvarsan or Neo-914), which usually results in the chancre softening and disappearing within about a week, leading to a cure. This is generally recognized by medical practitioners and is undisputed. Soft chancre is caused by the transmission of the Ducrey-Unna bacillus. According to medical records and past clinical experience, the process from onset to treatment usually takes three to four weeks, or even five to six weeks. This refers to continuous and active treatment. If treatment is intermittent, with periods of improvement followed by relapse, the condition often becomes chronic, sometimes lasting for months. Therefore, soft chancre is much more difficult to treat than hard chancre. Medical practitioners regard it with apprehension, and patients often become doubtful, wondering why some people can be cured in a week while others take weeks to heal. They often blame the doctors for improper treatment methods or techniques. However, they do not realize that chancres are divided into hard and soft types, with different symptoms, courses, and treatments, and significant differences in the ease of treatment. Because soft chancres are stubbornly difficult to treat, their treatment methods deserve the utmost attention from medical practitioners, and the doubts of patients are not entirely without merit. This is because the symptoms of soft chancres are highly variable, easily leading to diagnostic errors by doctors. Moreover, the disease is insidious, and once it ulcerates, its consequences are more severe than those of hard chancres. Here, I briefly describe my personal treatment experiences for reference.</p>
<p>Compared to hard chancre patients, the ratio of soft chancre patients we see is roughly three to seven, with soft chancres being less common. Soft chancres that develop on the foreskin of the penis in men or the labia majora or minora in women are very easy to diagnose and there is no chance of error. However, soft chancres that develop on the glans penis and the external urethral meatus in men, or the posterior fourchette and near the urethral opening in women, are very prone to diagnostic errors. This is because the tissue in these areas is relatively hard and firm. If one is slightly careless, it is easy to misdiagnose them as hard chancres. Furthermore, the inflammation around the ulcer often increases its hardness, making it look very similar to a hard chancre. In addition, some ulcers are surrounded by red, swollen, raised edges, called elevated chancres (Ulcus molle elevatum), which are indistinguishable from hard chancres. It is difficult to tell them apart. Moreover, some ulcers may appear to be healing but then turn into hard nodules, or the area around and underneath the still-ulcerated lesion gradually becomes raised and hard, a condition called mixed chancre (Ulcus mixta). This can be very confusing and difficult to differentiate. Even more strangely, in men with gonorrhea, a small, linear ulcer often develops on the inner side of the urethral opening one or two weeks after the onset of the disease. There is no significant inflammation around it. Initially, it may be mistaken for irritation caused by the gonorrheal discharge or for the onset of syphilis. However, when treatment for syphilis fails, the treatment for soft chancre is applied, and the disease is cured. Such cases are not uncommon. This is the most significant variation of soft chancre. Fortunately, for these difficult-to-diagnose and confirm soft chancres, there is a new, simple, and rapid treatment that can be used for testing. This is a great boon for our medical community. After the failure of anti-syphilitic treatment for these variant chancres, the new therapy invariably leads to a complete cure.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, in treating soft chancres, in addition to common ointments or dusting powders, I often used 5% copper sulfate ointment. After applying it for a day and night, the wound surface would be clean. After that, I would switch to ordinary ointments, hoping that the lesion would gradually heal and no longer spread. Ten years ago, I switched to Erinacol ointment. The method of application was the same as with copper sulfate ointment, but the irritation and pain were weaker, and the results were much better. I was secretly delighted. However, the entire treatment process still took about three weeks. During this long process, a slight carelessness could lead to secondary lymphadenitis or enlargement, turning into an erosive lesion. I was secretly uneasy, and patients often felt dissatisfied. In recent years, in addition to external medications, I have always added a new agent called Dmelcos. This agent is a vaccine of Ducrey's bacillus, administered as an intravenous injection. The minimum dose is 200 million bacteria, injected every three to four days. The dose is gradually increased. Based on my personal experience, most patients are cured after two or three injections. It is rare for patients to require four or five injections. However, after the injection, there is often a high degree of chills and fever. This varies greatly depending on the individual's physical strength. Some experience only a mild reaction, while others have a fever all night on the day of the injection. Many patients often deeply regret the rashness of the injection when they experience a fever on the day of the injection. However, after one or two days, they feel a sharp reduction in local symptoms and realize that the drug is indeed effective. They automatically request a second injection. If appropriate external treatments are also applied, the entire course of soft chancre treatment usually takes about ten days, or less than ten days. It is rare for it to last for twenty days. Therefore, Dmelcos injections are most needed for variant chancres or when anti-syphilitic treatment is ineffective. Its effectiveness reliably shortens the healing time of soft chancres and reduces various dangerous complications such as buboes (i.e., lymphadenitis).</p>
<h3>A Few Words About "Minsheng" Ximeiling</h3>
<p>— Dai Xinggang</p>
<p>The Minsheng Manufacturing Factory in Hangzhou has been built with hardship and is now fully scaled. Recently, they invented a special medicine for gout called "Ximeiling" (Simalin). They extracted the active ingredients from the Chinese medicine Fangji and made it into hydrochloride salt. It took them two years and huge amounts of money, as well as the lives of countless animals, to finally succeed. The preparations include injections and tablets, which have the same effect as the Japanese product Shinamin. Before releasing it, in addition to animal experiments, they also had male and female employees of the factory personally test it to see if there were any reactions. This kind of spirit of sacrifice is truly admirable. They also asked major doctors to conduct clinical trials. It has been improved eight times, and I have personally witnessed and heard about the factory's efforts to invent it. I have also tried it and asked them to improve it three or four times. Those who have used it praise its effectiveness. Recently, I heard someone secretly discussing and suspecting that it came from Japan, disguised under a new name. Alas, what is this saying? Although I dare not say that there are no such fraudulent people and deceitful schemes in China, given the factory's outstanding reputation, I firmly believe that they would never be so insane, harming themselves and the country. Moreover, I have known them for a long time. In fact, if they wanted to sell refurbished goods, they could have launched them long ago. Why wait until today? If it were finished goods from another country, they would have been launched smoothly and profitably. Why is there still a report of local mild pain in the doctor's clinical trial records over the years? (Japanese goods never cause pain, but they sometimes cause flushing and rash. Minsheng's Ximeiling, in past trials, did not cause rash or flushing, but subcutaneous injections easily caused pain, while intramuscular injections did not.) I heard that the factory still holds the ambition to work hard and continue to strive to establish a reputation. Why suspect it? Now, regarding the local mild pain, after pharmacological and physiological improvements, it has been appropriately resolved. In the future, the product will no longer cause pain, according to Mr. Zhou Shilu, the manager of the factory. I hope that colleagues in the medical field will use it at any time and report the results for reference. I am not writing this article to promote the factory, but out of conscience. Maintaining good domestic medicines is also the common wish of those who care. Alas, what kind of world is this? Reciting Bao Sang's poems, I have great hope for Chinese pharmaceutical factories like "Minsheng" that strive so hard.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (6)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 4 The Progression of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>According to the explanations in the previous two chapters, tubercle bacilli enter the human body through inhalation, and on the other hand, various unfavorable inducements promote their invasion. Then, can we say that pulmonary tuberculosis is completely established at this point? This question should be answered separately. Indeed, at this time, the tubercle bacilli are definitely causing trouble in the lungs and will cause local lesions. However, most of these lesions heal quickly and do not spread into disease, nor do they cause any external symptoms. The person being invaded certainly does not feel anything, and even doctors cannot prove it using various precise diagnostic methods. This change is what is commonly called "primary infection." Although it has no clinical evidence, the evidence from autopsy is very sufficient. According to statistics in this area, it accounts for more than two-thirds of the total human population. Among the poor, almost 97 out of every 100 corpses show traces of local lesions. Based on this fact, we can know that in the course of people's lives, almost everyone has been invaded by tubercle bacilli at least once and developed local lesions. The great German pathologist Aschoff said it well: "Every person in the world, no matter who they are, has had pulmonary tuberculosis once in their childhood." This argument is certainly alarming, but if readers understand the truth of "primary infection," then they will also know that this is an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>This "primary infection" is not limited to the lungs. It can be caused by food. The example mentioned earlier of children suffering from intestinal tuberculosis due to drinking milk is a good example. Commonly known cervical lymph node tuberculosis (commonly known as scrofula), mostly affecting women and children, can also enter through the nose and throat, passing through the tonsils. (Author's note: This route has not yet been definitively established, and many hold dissenting opinions.) Eczema on the neck and head can also be invaded. Lupus vulgaris, a type of skin tuberculosis, takes the nose and its surroundings as its main base, and its invasion is closely related to scratching the nostrils with fingernails. These few obvious examples undoubtedly fall outside the scope of pulmonary tuberculosis itself, but I think everyone should know them and not take them lightly.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Delegation Participating in the Far Eastern Games Returns to Shanghai This Afternoon; Landing at the New Customs Wharf at 1:30 PM; the National Sports Association Will Host a Welcome Banquet Tonight, Along with Mayor Wu and Others</h3>
<p>The Chinese delegation attending the 10th Far Eastern Games, a group of 155 people led by Dr. Wang Zhengting, set off from the Philippines on the 23rd aboard the President Jefferson of the Dollar Steamship Lines to return to China. Except for athletes and staff from South China who disembarked in Hong Kong, the rest will arrive in Shanghai at 1:30 PM today and land at the New Customs Wharf, staying at the New YMCA. It is expected that a large number of people will welcome them at the port. The Diligence Sports Monthly and the Baihong Track and Field Team will both send people to welcome them.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Sports Advancement Association will hold a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road at 7:00 PM tonight to entertain Mayor Wu, prominent figures who have enthusiastically helped this time, and sports reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, as a welcome reception for the delegation.</p>
<h3>The Opening Performance of the Chinese Tennis Club is Wonderful; Xu Chengji, Lin Baohua, and Qiu Feihai Will All Appear; the Wang Sisters May Also Appear for a Women's Performance; Starting at 3:00 PM This Afternoon on Singapore Road</h3>
<p>The newly organized Chinese Tennis Club will hold its opening performance competition at 3:00 PM this afternoon, with performances by our country's Far Eastern Games athletes Xu Chengji and others. A total of one singles match and one doubles match will be held. In the singles match, Xu Chengji will face Lin Baohua. Xu has lost to Lin twice before, but his skills have improved since then and cannot be compared to the past. Therefore, the outcome of today's battle is uncertain. However, Xu has been sailing at sea for seven days and will compete immediately after landing, so his performance may be diminished. In the doubles match, Xu Chengji and Qiu Feihai will face Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia. The strength of both sides is evenly matched, and a wonderful performance is expected. The Wang sisters from Shanxi may also appear for a women's performance. The tennis court is on Singapore Road, near Connaught Road and Little Xadu Road. Tickets are available in four prices: one yuan, one and a half yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>The Grand Occasion of the Shanghai Municipal People's Amateur Sports Games</h3>
<p>▲The Opening Ceremony Was Held in the Morning, and Yu Hongjun Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>▲All Track and Field Records Were Broken Except for High Jump and Long Jump</p>
<p>The 5th Shanghai Municipal People's Amateur Sports Games was held yesterday at the Municipal Public Sports Field. More than 500 people participated in track and field and national martial arts. The sports events began at 7:30 AM, and the opening ceremony was held at 8:00 AM. Secretary-General Yu from the Municipal Government, Director Pan from the Education Bureau, and Zhu Jiarang from the Municipal Party Committee delivered speeches. All track and field and national martial arts events ended at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. In track and field events, all Shanghai records were broken except for the high jump and long jump. Five places were awarded in each event. The first place winner received a gold medal, and the rest received silver medals. The awards were given on the spot at the end of each event. The overall individual score winners will be given additional awards after the number of winners is determined. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony: Yu's Speech</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, the honorary chairman, did not attend yesterday due to business. Secretary-General Yu attended the meeting and delivered a speech, stating that in this time of national crisis, if we want to save the country and revive the nation, we must first train the body and mind of the people. Sports are the best way for athletes to train their body and mind. Athletes not only have strong physiques, but also receive good training in personal morality and character, and develop discipline and cooperation. These are all great contributions to the country and society. You are all employed people who do not pay attention to other entertainment in your spare time, but focus on sports. Your purpose is certainly not for the sake of championships, but because you feel that the country is in crisis, and everyone is striving to improve. I hope this spirit will be maintained.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Next, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating: Everyone is pursuing sports as an amateur hobby and training their bodies to save the country from danger. I hope that those who participate with this conscious concept will develop more and more each year. However, from the past to the present, most participants have been men, and very few women have registered, so there is no way to hold competitions. Therefore, I also hope that female compatriots will participate in the next games to expand mass sports and make further progress. I wish you all excellent results. These results should not be measured by getting first place, but by creating new records and improving year by year.</p>

<h3>Activity Report</h3>
<p>Then, after a speech by Zhu Jiarang, the representative of the Municipal Party Committee, Ma Chonggan, the director of the association, reported that 589 people participated in the sports this time, an increase of 200 people compared to last year. The sports events are divided into track and field and national martial arts. 530 people participated in track and field, and 59 people participated in national martial arts. Because there are many events, the conference was afraid that they could not be completed in one day, so some events were pre-selected yesterday and this morning.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Competition</h3>
<p>The veteran Wang Jianwu works for the Public Concession Tram Company and has a passion for sports. He is over forty years old. He has participated in the People's Sports Games every year since 1916, for a total of 19 times. He is good at the 200-meter and 400-meter events and has won championships many times. He still participated in these two events this year. Although he is getting older, he is still full of energy and has attracted the attention of the audience. Unfortunately, Peng Guangxin in the 200 meters and He Debao in the 400 meters had better results this year, so the veteran ranked second, calling it "meeting an enemy."</p>
<p>Little Black Charcoal Guan Youliang works for the Electric Company and is good at long-distance running. He is a member of the Chinese Sports Games. He participated in the 3000-meter race this time, running around the field ten times. Zhou Ruquan, Liu Xueming, and others led for the first five laps. Black Charcoal lagged behind by 20 meters. After the seventh lap, he accelerated like a swift horse, not panicking, and charged straight forward. He finally won first place with a time of 10 minutes and 28.6 seconds. Guan has good endurance and good posture. If he works hard in training, he will be a good general in the 10,000-meter race.</p>
<p>In the 1500 meters, Liu Xueming originally had a good chance of getting first place, but he participated in the 3000 meters first, and his strength was insufficient, so he won third place. Pan Gongbao and Zhou Zhiren also participated in the 3000 meters and won first place in the preliminaries. Yesterday, they gave up the 3000 meters to concentrate on the 100 meters and won the first place. This is also due to the limitation of time. Otherwise, the competition in the 3000 meters would have been even more intense.</p>
<p>Yan Yi, the first place winner in the triple jump, achieved a score of 12.015 meters, breaking the previous record of 11.68 meters. Guo Dayuan, the second place winner, achieved a score of 12 meters, which was slightly different from the first place. Guo's leg elasticity is actually better than Yan's, but unfortunately, his technique was not good when jumping, and he could not exert all his strength. With a little training, he would definitely achieve amazing results. Hu Yinji, the fourth place winner, usually has very good results, but he suffered a lot yesterday because he did not wear spiked shoes.</p>

It would be enough if he could demonstrate his best performance.

<h3>Jiang Jieshi Shortens Jiangxi High School Graduates' Summer Military Training to Six Weeks</h3>
<p>Training Scheduled to Begin July 1st Province-Wide</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education previously received a handwritten order from Chairman Jiang, requiring all high school and higher graduates in the province to undergo strict military training in Nanchang during this summer vacation, otherwise they would not be issued graduation certificates. This was reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that Cheng Shih-Kwei, the head of the Jiangxi Education Department, has determined that the training period will begin on July 1st as the summer vacation approaches. However, it was felt that completing the training in three weeks was too short and would not be very effective. Originally, the order called for three months, but the schools felt that this period was too long, and the graduates would not have enough time to take entrance exams for higher education, which would harm their future prospects. Director Cheng reported this difficulty to Chairman Jiang and requested that the training period be shortened in light of these circumstances to facilitate the graduates' entrance exams and higher education. Chairman Jiang approved the request yesterday, shortening the training period to six weeks.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Director Arrives in Nanjing for Inspection</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department recently sent Section Chief Chen Xifang and two others to inspect all provincial primary schools in the province. Chen and his colleagues arrived in Nanjing a few days ago and are staying at the junior high school division of Nanjing Middle School in Bafutang. Director Zhou Fohai also came along. They are scheduled to begin inspecting the provincial Nanjing Middle School and Experimental Primary School, as well as the Nanjing Girls' Middle School and Experimental Primary School, on the 28th. It is reported that this inspection will be very thorough, and they will conduct detailed examinations of the schools' administration, teaching methods, educational practices, and student performance. They will also conduct surprise quizzes in accordance with ministry regulations.</p>
<h3>Anhui Education Director Yang Lian Contacts the Ministry of Education Regarding Military Training</h3>
<p>Anhui Education Director Yang Lian, upon receiving an order, prepared a plan for implementing military training in senior high schools in the province and submitted it to Chairman Jiang for review. Chairman Jiang instructed the Ministry of Education to review it, and the Ministry instructed Director Yang to come to Nanjing. Yang arrived in Nanjing on the 26th and went to the Ministry of Education at 5:00 PM to discuss the matter. The plan calls for extracting one semester from the three years (six semesters) of senior high school specifically for intensive military training. In addition to military training, core subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics will also be taught during this semester.</p>
<h3>World-Renowned School Architecture Expert Mr. Huth Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Mr. Huth, a world-renowned expert in school architecture, and his wife arrived in Shanghai on the 18th. Accompanied by Ministry of Education specialist Li Jiaxiang, they visited schools of all levels in Shanghai, including elementary, middle, and high schools. On the 22nd, they went to Hangzhou to visit Zhejiang University, Provincial No. 1 Middle School (both male and female), and about eight schools including senior high schools, junior high schools, elementary schools, and kindergartens. They also visited rural schools, including the Civil Education Experimental Zone in Lingjiaqiao, midway on the Hangzhou-Fu Road. Mr. Huth greatly admired the local materials used to build the schools in the district, noting their practicality and beauty. He said that China, facing national difficulties and financial constraints, should not prioritize grandeur and waste resources when building schools. Instead, they should focus on practicality, optimizing lighting and ventilation, and pursuing rational construction within economic limitations. Mr. Huth examined and carefully studied all the schools he saw in Shanghai and Hangzhou, both newly built and renovated, as well as those converted from civilian residences and temples. He believed that the shortcomings of Chinese schools, such as the inability to eliminate odors in toilets, unsanitary kitchens, and inadequate bathroom facilities, were similar to those in Russia. He felt that his experience in Russia could be valuable for exchanging ideas with the Chinese authorities. After completing his visit in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Huth arrived in Nanjing with Ministry of Education specialist Li Jiaxiang on the 26th. They met with Minister Wang at the Ministry of Education at 6:00 PM that afternoon to discuss everything. The Ministry hoped that Mr. Huth would stay in Nanjing for a longer period of time to provide guidance. Mr. Huth has requested a two-week extension from Moscow. Mr. Huth is scheduled to visit the Central University campus and other schools starting on the 27th. If he has time in the future, he plans to visit schools in North China as well, but this has not yet been decided.</p>

To save China, social education must be implemented. However, today's social education often suffers from being too far removed from the people. Now, the Nian Er Society can integrate education and production and penetrate deep into the grassroots, which is a blessing for China's future." The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Culture Director Wen sent Sixth District Director Tan to the meeting to deliver a speech, stating, "Under Gandhi's leadership, India used peaceful means to resist British oppression. The only effect was that every household in India had a loom. They wove their own cloth and wore it to curb the economic aggression of imperialism. China is now suffering from the same aggression from imperialism. The purpose and method of the Nian Er Society is the key to the revitalization of the nation." Later, Shu Xincheng, the head of the Compilation Department of the China Book Company, and Xu Kejian, a representative from Daxia University, gave speeches, elaborating on education and production. The meeting adjourned at about 11:00 AM for a group photo.</p>

<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of Weifeng New School Site</h3>
<p>The Weifeng Private Girls' Elementary School in this city has been established for five years. Due to the rapid increase in the number of students, the original site was insufficient. The school recently moved into its new four-story building at 555 Avenue Haig. Yesterday, the school held the inauguration ceremony for the new school building and opened a parents' meeting to welcome guests from all walks of life to visit. Student achievements were displayed for guests to view. Over a thousand guests from all walks of life attended, making the event a great success. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, and school director Zhou Weishi personally attended the event to deliver speeches. Students performed over sixteen entertainment programs, including "Give Me Back My Freedom" by the fourth grade and "The End of Strong Powers" by the third grade, which were particularly moving. Refreshments were provided, and Principal Zhou Cuiying warmly welcomed the guests, and everyone enjoyed themselves.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Model High School's Classes of 1923 Host Banquet for Faculty and Staff, Install Electric Bells as Memorial</h3>
<p>Students from the Nanyang Model High School's Classes of 1923, including Li Mingji, Qian Zhuang, Feng Xianpei, Qiu Shigang, and Yan Chengjie, held a farewell banquet at the school's auditorium yesterday to honor the faculty and staff, as their studies were about to be completed. Principal Shen, Academic Dean Zhao, Shen Shukui, Ma Xiezhong, Zhu Zhongming, Chen Binghui, Zhu Qiyun, Wang Ketian, and dozens of others attended. The banquet was arranged in a "若" (ruo, like) shape, with six tables. Student hosts Li Mingji, Qian Zhuang, Hu Qinian, Feng Xianpei, and Gu Duhong provided attentive service. Shen Hechen, a Bachelor of Arts from Aurora University, performed a French song, which was moving and beautiful. Yan Chengjie performed a harmonica solo, which was melodious and refreshing. It is reported that Yan joined the Chinese Harmonica Association in 1927 and has extensive experience, so his performance was particularly good. Qiu Kunde sang "Silang Visits His Mother," with a clear and bright voice, earning a round of applause from the audience, adding much color to the event. Other faculty and staff also gave performances, both elegant and humorous, which were exceptionally wonderful. It is reported that the 30+ graduates of this year's Classes of 1923 have installed electric bells on the eaves of the elementary and secondary school buildings as a permanent memorial. The bells will be used as the standard for class start and end times, saving the staff from the labor of ringing the bells. This is truly a good memorial.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office, located at 291 Avenue Paul Beau, with its spirit of hard work and scientific approach, has quickly become one of the most important academic institutions. Shanghai is, in fact, the center of culture and economy in the country. The fact that the office is conducting specialized research on this center from all aspects is inevitably needed and welcomed by the country. The senior academician Liu Yazi is the director of the office, while the deputy director Zhu Shaoping oversees the office's administrative affairs. The chief editor, Xu Weinan, oversees the research and reporting methods and is also engaged in the work of the Shanghai evolution section. When each report is submitted to the director, Liu reviews it extremely carefully, raising various questions and making corrections. Since the publication of *Shen Bao* (this newspaper), the office has completely indexed the news about Shanghai and transcribed the important ones into volumes. This work is obviously one of the office's hard work, but its importance is beyond doubt. The office publishes a journal, which has been published four times. Each issue is quickly snapped up by academic institutions at home and abroad. Due to funding constraints, only 1,000 copies are printed per issue, which is not even enough to send to all the higher public institutions, which is a pity. However, because the journal is important and practical, private institutions such as financial circles, publishing circles, and industrial circles are in great need of the journal. The office will compile and print 300 copies of the first-year journal in a fine-bound edition for sale to meet the needs. The price is five yuan per copy, with a 10% surcharge for postage to other cities. Those who need it can purchase it quickly. The journal has a generous and elegant format, without any advertisements. The impression is already excellent, and the 1,000+ pages of solid content are particularly admirable.</p>
<h3>Daxia to Continue to Run Summer School</h3>
<p>Daxia University has been running summer schools for several years, with remarkable results. This year, it has decided to continue running the ninth summer school, with classes starting on July 8th. There are about 50 courses in arts, sciences, education, commerce, law, and engineering, all taught by renowned experts. All university students, primary and secondary school teachers, those preparing to take university entrance exams or various exams from the Examination Yuan, and those who wish to improve their specialized knowledge are welcome to enroll. Brochures will be sent upon request. The school is located in a scenic area of Shanghai and has spacious and clean school buildings, making it ideal for studying during the summer.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Board of Trustees of Meixin School</h3>
<p>Meixin Elementary School, located at No. 30, Taihe Lane, Baierbu Road, French Concession, has been established for two years. The founder of the school, Gong Hanwen, considering the current economic depression and the fact that many children of laborers are deprived of education, in order to provide relief, charges very low fees: six yuan for grades one and two, eight yuan for grades three and four, and ten yuan for grades five and six. Therefore, the school has flourished and has more than one hundred students. Last night at 8:00 PM, a banquet was held at Zhimeilou on Sima Road to entertain the school board members. More than ten people attended, including Ye Hancheng, Li Chunsen, Zhuang Zhenfu, and Hu Jingqu. After the banquet, the first meeting of the board of trustees was held. It was resolved that: 1. Gu Wensheng was publicly elected as the chairman of the board. 2. The board would submit an official document to the Municipal Education Bureau for registration. The meeting adjourned at around 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Yu Xiang Piao Miao Lu (Record of Fragrant Imperial Vapors)</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) The pine in “Song Song” is just an ordinary pine tree, without any other fancy patterns. Due to the limitations of its actual size, it cannot be freely embellished, and it is just a pure green color.</p>
<p>From this, the reader can understand how difficult and intricate the process of embroidering these yellow satin fabrics with their patterns was. My previous estimate of its value at around six to seven thousand taels of silver was truly the minimum price! However, this was only a kind of ornamentation used to cover the interior of the imperial carriage, and perhaps the Empress Dowager never even noticed it! But in reality, the Empress Dowager did not spend much money on these embroidered items, apart from the raw materials. Because the weavers and embroiderers were all kept in the palace for a long time, and they never cared about their wages. Even the length of their working hours was entirely at the discretion of the imperial decree, and they had no say in the matter. Perhaps a piece of work could be finished in a month or two, or perhaps it could not be finished in three or four years. Perhaps a person could work until they were exhausted and even blind, but their work was still not finished. In that case, another person would have to be assigned to continue the work, ensuring that it was completed perfectly.</p>
<p>The body of the imperial carriage itself was made of rattan, and the workmanship was undoubtedly particularly exquisite and durable. On each side of the carriage, halfway up, there was a wooden pole attached. These two poles were made of the most solid wood, rounded in the middle and slightly flattened at both ends. And at both the front and back ends, there was a crossbar connecting them. These four wooden poles, both vertical and horizontal, formed a rectangle, and the imperial carriage was sandwiched in the middle of this rectangle. When it was carried, eight sedan chair bearers would occupy the four corners of this rectangle. (44)</p>
<h3>Philosophy of Love</h3>
<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>A certain classmate of mine from middle school is young, good-looking, and very fashionable in his attire. Recently, he asked me to express some of my philosophy of love. I know that a certain young lady is fond of him, and he is now entangled in the languid bed of love and cannot extricate himself.</p>
<p>Love, originally, has no so-called distinction of philosophy or science. For young people to forcibly include love in a philosophical course of study is perhaps a meddlesome act. But on the other hand, for young people to actually recognize love as a philosophy, and to see love as a noble and profound course of study to be learned, shows that their simple and pure hearts are lovely.</p>
<p>I quite believe in Ibsen, and my classmate should know this. I will now use Ibsen's "all or nothing" tone to express my philosophy of love: "Rather have no lover than a non-standard beauty!"</p>
<p>Mentioning standard beauty, the question then arises. What kind of standard should be established for beauty? A standard privately conceived, or one publicly recognized by the masses? "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." If the masses recognize someone as not meeting the standard, but you stubbornly insist that they are above the standard, then I ask you, do you love them or not?</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have left room for retreat. We are discussing philosophy, and philosophy has subjectivity. Subjectivity is an essential element of philosophy. Are you facing an opponent, someone who is truly a standard beauty? You can rely on your own subjectivity to make a determination. In other words, if you think they are a standard beauty, then you can love them. To put it another way, if you want to love them, you don't have to ask me.</p>
<p>Several friends wanted me to express my philosophy of love. I now humbly borrow a corner of the Spring and Autumn Annals to fulfill this wish.</p>
<h3>Malaria</h3>
<p>— Zheng Chuyao</p>
<p>Generally, wanderers adrift in foreign lands easily become intimate friends with illness. For example, myself, due to the lashings of life, this time, I was lashed to this mountainous place. Every day, not many people are seen, only many green-leaved trees constantly entering my sight. Logically, living in a place with such good air should increase one's health, right? But, coincidentally, I contracted a very annoying case of malaria in this good place. Originally, this disease could be cured immediately by swallowing a few pills of quinine that target the symptoms, but they are not available in this mountainous place. There's no way, so I can only try to follow the local people's folk remedies, doing it "just in case." The method is like this:</p>
<p>On the day when malaria is about to strike, get up early in the morning on an empty stomach, finish eating a piece of dried tofu prepared the night before, with a symbol carved on it that is said to ward off malaria. Then, all alone, without letting anyone see you, run to a place near the street, and when you encounter a well or a river, take out a red paper packet also prepared the night before—a packet containing seven grains of rice, seven tea leaves, and a copper coin—and place it on the wellhead or the riverbank. At the same time, say to the red paper packet, "Sir! You should wait here for me for a moment, I'll go buy a cup of tea for you to drink."</p>
<p>After speaking, run back to your place of residence from another street without looking back. It is said that this will completely cure the malaria.</p>
<p>I once tried this method, but when I ran back from another street, that annoying disease broke out immediately! In bed, I asked the local person who told me the method, "Why is this method so ineffective!"</p>
<p>"Sir, that's because you were not sincere enough!"</p>
<p>This was the answer he gave me.</p>

<h3>Tiger Stove</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>It's impossible to verify when the tiger stove originated, but its latent power is universally widespread. On the streets and in the alleys, the stove operators, with short sleeves and bare torsos, spiritedly wield their water ladles, pouring water non-stop into the nanny's tin buckets, the elder sister's thermos, and the maid's hanging kettle. Here, we see the rough hands and feet of the nannies, the alluring poses of the elder sisters, and the delicate and exquisite nature of the maids. By the tiger stove, various phenomena are reflected as if in a movie.</p>
<p>"Our young lady is so formidable! Our concubine is so romantic! Our wife is Amitabha!"... "They don't care about playing mahjong, but they are extremely stingy with our wages! There are still those who get three yuan! Three and a half yuan. To be honest, ladies and young ladies, they are clever themselves, and they personally go to buy small dishes! We can't get a penny! Wages must be raised to seven or eight yuan per month!" "Dream on! The only ones who are willing to spend money are the young ladies and concubines, secretly giving to their lovers!" This is the broadcast of the nannies and elder sisters, swarming around the tiger stove!</p>
<p>There is also the maid crying about the mistreatment she receives from her master, pouring out her heart with affection to the chauffeur of his family, perhaps leading to her running away!</p>
<p>Morning, noon, and evening, these many crowds gather together, playing a special symphony!</p>
<p>Ah! The tiger stove is truly a broadcasting station for maids, servants, and chauffeurs!</p>

<h3>Beauty Tips for Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>(1) Enhancing the Beauty of the Forehead. The forehead is the most important part of the face, affecting the overall appearance. The shape of the foreheads of us Chinese people can generally be divided into five types: round, square, pointed, U-shaped, and M-shaped. Depending on how each shape is, the way the hair covers the forehead and the decorations used will also be different. If it is a narrow forehead, the hair on the left and right ends of the hairline should be appropriately shaved off, and a thin layer of cold cream should be applied. At the same time, the hairstyle should be styled to match the forehead. Generally, women with narrow foreheads should comb their hair in a four-six or six-four style. If combing a six-four style, divide the hair to the right in a six-four split. The first wave (i.e., use a hair iron to create a wave shape) should be swept straight up, the second wave should cover the forehead slightly lower down, and the third wave should hang down by the edge of the forehead. Combing a four-four style (dividing the hair to the right in a four-four split) allows the hair in front of the forehead to be completely swept up, with only one wave (wave shape) hanging down. If the corners of the forehead are unattractive, a thin curl can be used as decoration. For people with wide foreheads, it is easier to decorate, because modern beauty is most suitable for wide foreheads. However, if the forehead is too wide, the corners on the left and right ends will be too exposed, so a center-parted hairstyle should be used, which means dividing the hair in the center of the top of the head and then making waves on both sides of the forehead corners, which will look very beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) Facial Beautification Method. Whether male or female, the cheeks gradually become thin in middle age. For women, thin cheeks reduce their charm, so cheek makeup should not be ignored. (1) Makeup for Plumping Cheeks. First, apply cleansing cream (Cold Cream - this cream can remove oil from the face, or high-quality soap can also be used). Use your fingers to gently press the thin areas of the cheeks twenty to thirty times, and then use the palm of your hand to stroke them twenty to thirty times, so that the outside of the cheeks will feel warm. Every morning, use a toothbrush dipped in a little salt to brush the gums and the inside of the cheeks, and then they will slowly become plump. When applying makeup to the cheeks, blush (not rouge) is now used, because the magic of blush can make the appearance of the cheeks appear to bulge. As for artificial cheek-plumping methods, the common method is to hold cotton in the mouth. A piece of medicinal cotton the size of a Go stone is first soaked in water, and then the tip of the tongue is used to tuck it inside the cheek. However, this cotton must be changed three or four times a day, because it will become smelly if it is kept in the mouth for a long time. Recently, Western women have found it very inconvenient to hold cotton, so they have switched to cheek-plumping devices, which are installed on the gums. (2) Makeup for High Cheekbones. In general, women with prominent cheekbones are not very attractive. To hide this shortcoming, it all depends on using blush. Apply rectangular blush to the center point between the protruding part of the cheekbones and the ear, but the slanted part should be dark, gradually fading to the left and right, so that the high part will not be conspicuous.</p>
<p>(3) Chin Makeup. (1) Concave Chin. If properly decorated, it can also display its characteristics. According to the principles of makeup, there is a method of first "applying red according to the shape of the chin." People with flat foreheads should decorate the recessed part below the lips with a hazy appearance, but it should not be too red. The blush should be light, and the upper and lower eyelids should be made prominent (with eyelid cream). If you think that your cheeks are thin and your chin is flat and concave, it is best to rub your cheeks with your fingers every night, so that they can gradually become plump. (2) Women with High and Wide Chins should apply cold cream close to the collar, and then use blush, gradually smearing it from the tip of the chin downwards into a halo, that is, gradually smearing it from the cheek to the ear, gradually from dark to light, so that the other person sees a round face. (3) Makeup for a Long Chin. A slender face must have a long chin. If the nose is high, it can barely be concealed. For makeup for a long chin, the first emphasis is on the tip of the chin. Apply blush on the tip of the chin, and gradually smear it with your fingers towards the mouth. The cheeks should be comparatively round and very red, so as to slightly cover the shortcoming of a long chin.</p>
<p>(4) Makeup for a Chinless Face. This is the biggest flaw in a face. First apply cold cream, and then use a small amount of eye cream on the lower part of the chin (a cream that is applied to the shadow of the eyelids, available in several colors such as black, green, tea, and gray. This is Western women's evening makeup) to create the appearance of a shadow, so that it looks like there is a chin.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast Army</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 29: I am heartbroken to express my independence, and swear allegiance together with blood.</p>
<p>Ji Zhi said: Regardless of whether she is true-hearted or not, I gratefully decline the matter of matchmaking that you mentioned, Sister-in-law. Mrs. Gan pointed at him with her chopstick tip and said: You are too silly. Are you going to keep waiting for her even if she becomes someone else's wife? Ji Zhi blushed and said: I don't quite understand what you're saying, Sister-in-law. But I can confidently say that there is no one in this world who has the authority to make me that devoted. Mrs. Gan laughed: Don't be impatient. You haven't met that person yet. If you meet that person, you will know that there are people in this world who can make you that devoted. Speaking of this person, it is also a matter of fate. Once, I was traveling from the city to Haidian and sat with him on a long-distance bus, and we started talking. According to him, he was also coming to Haidian to see some girlfriend. I didn't inquire who that girlfriend was. But when I asked about his background, I found out that he was a relative of my second sister's in-laws. At the end of the year, when I went to my second sister's house, I happened to meet him again. My second sister said to me in front of him that she wanted me to be his matchmaker, which clearly meant that he was not married. At that time, I thought of you. Ji Zhi shook his head and said: That's not right. Since she is a female student, she is probably not afraid of people proposing marriage to her face, and she is also very civilized. Can a civilized woman be successful just because someone is acting as a matchmaker? Mrs. Gan said: That's natural. First, you have to introduce the two of you as friends. But I think he will definitely be interested in you. As for him, he is definitely more handsome than the people on Haidian Street, so you should also think highly of him. So, in the middle of these two matching up, this matter will definitely be successful. Ji Zhi didn't say anything, just kept holding his chopsticks and eating. After he finished eating, Houzhi walked away, and Mrs. Gan lowered her voice and laughed: Just now, you were a little uncomfortable to say anything in front of your brother, but now you can tell me the truth. What do you think of my proposal? If you agree, I will introduce you. (394)</p>

<h3>Talking About Tutoring</h3>
<p>— Zun Hui</p>
<p>"Crisis"! "Crisis"! Many people have shouted this. The "crisis" is the "trigger of the crisis"! It is arranged for young people to walk into.</p>
<p>In modern European countries, the direction of education has changed somewhat. How it has changed, I will not reveal the reasons for now. The education authorities should know the reasons, but looking at the current Chinese education system, it is clear that there is no direction to speak of. We have picked up a little bit of Westerners' superficial knowledge and are using it to fool young students here. (Alas! This is why students all want to go abroad!)</p>
<p>But one thing in front of us is particularly hateful! It's getting hot, and schools are taking summer vacation. The holiday coincides with the heat, so it's originally not a good time to study, but summer schools are being set up everywhere, called tutoring schools!</p>
<p>Since they are called tutoring, let's take medicine as an example. Chinese people believe in "tonics." Once one reaches the point of needing tonics, the body is probably not very healthy. Nüwa repaired the sky in the past precisely because "the sky tilted to the northwest, and the earth sank to the southeast." This is the first reason.</p>
<p>Monks and Taoists occasionally wear a colorful robe, which is very eye-catching. It is called a patchwork robe, made of patches of cloth of various colors and materials. But that can only be done</p>
<p>among monks and Taoists, as an exception, perhaps because of poverty. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>When it comes to studying and cultivating talent, there is no logic in tonics or patching. It is ridiculously absurd to take tonics all year round for no reason in order to benefit the body. This is using knowledge as a beneficial tonic. If knowledge is nothing more than broken canvas, and you want to gather it together, one more piece counts as one more, then this knowledge is even more meaningless and cannot become education.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but we modern people want to achieve things quickly, and we only want to be able to harvest fruits as soon as we plant seeds. So students desperately want to shorten the years of study, wanting to create ten years of knowledge in ten days. Those teachers, alas! They just want to add a little income in the hot weather. So tutoring schools are run by some, and others go in.</p>
<p>Abolishing all summer and winter vacation tutoring schools will not reduce the students' level of knowledge. On the contrary, they can take advantage of the months of rest to contact society, return to the people, and understand life, so that life can develop more freely. Just in terms of physical strength, it is more beneficial than burying oneself in desk work.</p>
<h3>Killing to Obtain Benefits</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>In the mountains bordering Yunnan and Burma, there is a kind of Kawa people. It is said that when they plant rice every year, they lie in wait in the bushes or forests, waiting for a passing visitor from another village. They suddenly jump out and chop him to death with a knife, and use his head and hot blood to sacrifice to the grain fields, so that they will surely have a bumper harvest that year.</p>
<p>Also, the Naga people in the mountains between Upper Burma and the Assam province of India are said to have similar behavior, but the purpose of the killing is to prevent epidemics and cure diseases. The circumstances of the killing are also very different: first, the captured or purchased people from distant lands are raised in the chief's house for about a month, and then a good day is chosen. A rope is tied around his neck, and he is led through the village like cattle and horses. Each household gives him</p>
<p>wine and meat to get him drunk and full, and then the wizard performs magic at night to kill him. The bones and meat are distributed to each family for preservation, while the head is returned to the chief, so that they will not fear the god of plague and demons. (It is said that the University of Yangon has this kind of head, which was obtained when conquering the Naga people.)</p>
<p>From the perspective of civilized people, this foolish act of killing to obtain benefits is naturally cruel and barbaric. However, for the sake of expanding territory, establishing a national foundation, and expanding influence, civilized people are no different from barbarians, and they still use heads and hot blood for sacrifices, and the amount needed and the cruelty of the killing are far beyond the imagination of barbarians.</p>
<p>Unlike barbarians who only need one and only need to kill a few times. Perhaps it is because civilized people use more clever methods, killing tools are more sophisticated, and they are sure to be effective, so no one can call them barbaric.</p>
<p>If the previous European war of foreign devils had not used the golden signs of preserving justice and upholding public reason to call, but had only stated to the public: "This is just a few of us fighting for the market, and we need human blood for sacrifices!" Then, I believe that the use of heads and hot blood would not have been so much. In short, the so-called civilized people are only good at stealing good nouns to cover themselves up. This can be seen in the killing to obtain benefits.</p>
<h3>The Universe and the Fly</h3>
<p>— Po Yu</p>
<p>A person who spends all day in the laboratory looking through a microscope sees the fly as a fly; a person who spends all day looking at the stars in the sky through a telescope sees the universe as a fly; bearing a very small mission and carefully trying to complete it is seeing the fly as a fly; planning the entire strategy and carefully promoting it is seeing the universe as a fly.</p>
<p>The experiment of scientific knowledge and the practice of social sciences are the same!</p>
<p>Because the teapot lid vibrated on the water vapor, the steam engine was invented: This is building the universe on the head of the fly! After the steam engine was invented, not to mention anything else, the application in transportation shrunk the "universe" in the region to a "fly." A journey of one or two weeks has been changed to a distance of only ten hours or so.</p>
<p>What is the falling of an apple? We drink and play cards. Who cares about such a fly-like event? However, that muddle-headed Newton regarded this as the "universe", so the "law of gravity" came into being.</p>
<p>The universe contains flies, and flies are related to the universe. Although the universe is large, without the smallness of the fly, it cannot become the universe. Although the fly is small, it is also impossible to leak out of the universe. All "existence" is the relationship between the universe and the fly. All "learning" is the understanding between the "universe" and the "fly."</p>
<p>Modern physics theories, whether it is the atomic theory or the wave-particle duality, are very precisely explaining the relationship between the universe and the fly. In psychology, whether it is behaviorism or gestalt theory, it is also about seeing the tiny behavior from the whole human body, understanding the whole behavior from the tiny physiology, or understanding the psychological trend from the whole situation.</p>
<p>Taking a person as a unit, a person's energy can only strive to achieve a fly-like result. And this fly-like result often affects culture, and these influences make us feel as vast as the universe.</p>
<p>The discoverers of many germs, their work is truly small, but the impact on medicine is amazing.</p>
<p>Vulgar people are arrogant. They look down on fly-like work. At the same time, they do not choose to do what they consider to be universe-like work. Their attitude is not that others' work is wrong, but just that they think others are "doing" it wrong. It seems that only "saying that everyone else's work is a fly" is a universe-like task.</p>
<p>There are such people in China, and there are particularly many such people. I remember that in the past, children under the old education had many good developmental natural impulses. Playing and lively smiles were destroyed by the elderly in this way. The elderly were unable to play themselves and had no smiles, so they were jealous of others and told the children not to move at all. Moving was said to be committing some error! They memorize these rules of error, and these rules are generally fixed, and of course they sound reasonable. This is because the elderly already have wives and grandchildren, and have a fixed world. But the children's impulses are often destroyed because of this, and soon they follow their fathers into that fixed world to pass on their offspring.</p>
<p>The countryside is shared. If you don't love mulberry trees because you think mulberry trees can't be eaten, then you can plant rice. But Chinese people are like this: he has no rice seedlings and doesn't want to plant. Planting is a hard thing, he understands it very well. He stands by and enjoys the cool, tearing down mulberry trees, and tearing down wheat as it grows. About tearing down mulberry, he said that there is an order that mulberry is poisonous, and I am following the order. About tearing down wheat, he said that some scientist's work said that wheat cannot be eaten, and I am his believer. It is best for everyone to sit quietly and remain silent with each other, then wouldn't we all be humans, without distinguishing between flies and the universe? Without distinguishing between flies and the universe, then you are the universe, and I am the universe. Now suddenly A is planting wheat and B is planting mulberry, even though they are fly-like small matters, it seems that compared with oneself, there is a distinction between the universe and the fly. So he says: "You are now, flies, flies, all flies!"</p>
<p>Using this Ah Q formula, he himself became the universe, and he could lie back and relax without a doubt. (1934, 5, 10, Beiping)</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Nora appeared as a female hero in the May Fourth era. Ms. Li Chao's death occurred at an opportune time. Under the pen of Dr. Hu Shi, an advocate of Ibsenism, she was portrayed as a warrior against feudal forces.</p>
<p>Now, Ibsen is gradually fading from the memory of the general public, and the "Biography of Li Chao" has also been removed from Chinese language textbooks. Nora's supporters have returned to Helmer's side, studying 1934 fashion, cubist furniture, and dance postures, etc., becoming perfect puppets. This is not surprising: the new youth, the trendsetters, the warriors in the "Weekly Review" camp, kowtow to their feudal enemies and loyally serve as guards for the Confucian establishment. It is only natural for modern girls to be content with being puppets.</p>
<p>Nora's greatness lies in her realization that she is in a puppet-like state, a complete awakening, leaving her family to see "whether it is I who am wrong, or the world that is wrong." As for what happened after she left, it seemed that everyone at the time was not very concerned. Ibsen himself seemed to have answered the "miracle of miracles" proposed at the end of the play "A Doll's House" in "The Lady from the Sea," so there was no need for everyone to worry about it anymore. Mr. Lu Xun was the first to be concerned about everything after Nora's departure (whether she would eventually fall due to having no way to go, or eventually return). He gave a speech at Beijing Women's Normal University titled "What Happens After Nora Leaves," putting forward a fundamental opinion: "Since Nora has awakened, it is not easy to return to a dream state, so she has to leave; but after leaving, she sometimes cannot avoid falling or returning. Otherwise, one must ask, what did she bring with her besides the awakened heart? She must be richer, have preparations in her bag, to put it bluntly, she must have money. Dreams are good; otherwise, money is essential." He also hinted that "demanding economic rights is indeed a very ordinary thing, perhaps requiring a more drastic struggle than demanding political rights." This speech was published in "Women's Magazine," but it did not attract deep attention or heated discussion at the time.</p>
<p>The call for the women's movement faded along with the New Culture Movement. The "Women's Weekly" of the "Min Kuo Daily" and the "Women's Weekly" of the "Beijing Jing Bao" ceased publication one after another. New women could not sustain themselves either. "Women's Magazine" repeatedly returned to cake recipe research. Men grew tired, and women became even less interested in adventurous heroic careers. The achievements of the women's movement were only co-education and women cutting their hair. Moreover, women had to live in some mansion, and their short hair had to be permed into a messy, flying style.</p>
<p>However, the reality of women's issues did not diminish in severity with the decline of the women's movement. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution, many female comrades participated in revolutionary work. After the establishment of the National Government, female comrades also held positions in various agencies, large and small. The Civil Code also granted women inheritance rights based on the party's general program. In this way, women seemed to be gaining economic rights smoothly. Before long, female comrades took off their armor and went to the inner chambers to enjoy happiness, needless to say. Female employees in various agencies became vases. Although women fighting for inheritance were sometimes seen in newspapers, the most common thing was to sue for alimony on the grounds of seducing someone under a certain age. The so-called women's professions, excluding waitresses and dancers, still saw many female shop assistants relying on their makeup to live a life of high enjoyment. No matter how it was performed, it still started and ended as a puppet, without any change.</p>
<p>Recently, the issue of Nora's departure has suddenly aroused heated discussion. Since Bing Xin raised the question of "What Happens After Nora Leaves" in the eleventh issue of the eleventh volume of "Guowen Weekly," articles participating in the debate have appeared in issues thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and eighteen. Articles discussing both sides of the issue have also been seen elsewhere. Bebel's famous work, "Woman and Socialism," has been mentioned and introduced again. It turns out that "since Nora has awakened, it is not easy to return to a dream state." How can one break free from the chains of tradition and become a dignified woman (not a puppet)? After all, some people are constantly thinking about it.</p>
<p>Ten years later, returning to the old question from ten years ago, is there no difference in perspective at all? No, ten years ago, Nora appeared before us as a female hero; now, Nora in everyone's mind is like what Yu Lichen said: "The Nora we idealize should be an ordinary woman, with the temperament and qualities that ordinary women have. She has the advantages that ordinary women have, and also the shortcomings that ordinary women have; when the time for awakening comes, she awakens before others, not because she is an extraordinary person, but precisely because she has all the aspects that ordinary people should have (see "The Reasons for Nora Leaving Her Family and What Happens After She Leaves")." Therefore, everything after Nora's departure cannot be supported by a peck or a bushel of sympathy; what is needed is still the question raised by Lu Xun: "Dreams are good, otherwise, money is essential." How exactly to fight for economic rights?</p>
<h3>Stepping Stone (1)</h3>
<p>— Caoming</p>
<p>Once, in the depths of winter, the sun weakly embraced Canxia Village. In the small house on the east side of the village, next to the Linshui Pavilion on the right, many women were moving around the bedside of a dying patient. The gray-yellow sunlight covering the walls of the small courtyard, like the women's tense mood for hope in the house, slowly disappeared into the dim dusk.</p>
<p>The patient, with long hair scattered on the pillow and a face as white as wax, moved her dry lips and said:</p>
<p>"Amei... come..."</p>
<p>The women nimbly pulled a little girl, made clumsy by the heavy cotton on her body, closer to the patient. Everyone waited in a disappointed silence, with solemn faces, as if expecting something.</p>
<p>"Amei! Don't be like your mother, dying so early. You must see the arrival of a fair world, definitely, heaven will not fail the poor..." She moved her thin, bamboo-like hands, trembling, and touched her daughter's face, which had been chapped by the north wind.</p>
<p>"Amei's mother is dead." Her father restrained his sorrowful face and hugged her, saying to his own younger sister:</p>
<p>"Fourth sister, take good care of her. I'll send you three yuan, or maybe five yuan a month. Although the rich make things difficult for the poor, why should the poor treat their own children unfairly!"</p>
<p>Amei's fourth aunt had no children. Her husband had gone to the market, so she took Amei from East Canxia Village and walked along the Willow-lined River to West Canxia Village to play. When spring came, Amei became lively and plump.</p>
<p>"These are willow trees, child. Over there, there is a big orchard; uh, your mother used to cut grass in this orchard, ruining two lives like this. Otherwise, you would already have a little brother!" The auntie suppressed her moist eyes, her chin resting on the child's head.</p>
<p>The spring breeze gently blew, lowering the soft willows, and gently sweeping the passing small boats. The child's bright black, round eyes looked at the blue sky, her head resting on her aunt's arm, calmly and comfortably looking forward to the world she imagined in her naive mind.</p>
<p>"Auntie, are there many fruits in the orchard? Will they all be given to Amei to eat?"</p>
<p>In this way, a year passed, and winter returned to the village. One day, the aunt, along with her brother, held Amei and stood in the spacious living room of a wealthy family in the south of the village. The father put his daughter down, his body wearing only an old set of flannel pants and jacket standing upright, his trembling hands holding fifty silver dollars, his mouth clumsy to the point of not being able to say a word.</p>
<p>The child stared with her eyes wide, forcefully pulling on her aunt's sleeve.</p>
<p>"Hehe, child, Grandma Huang here has many things for you to eat, many beautiful clothes for you to wear. I'll come to see you tomorrow."</p>
<p>When leaving, the father turned around and stumbled out of the door; the aunt secretly kissed Amei's hair with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>Grandma Huang pulled the child close to her side, gently stroking her yellow, weak hair, and sweetly said to her:</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, I don't hit children. I'll take you to see the rice fields tomorrow, where there are many rice stalks growing grain, and I'll also take you to see the orchard, oh, there are red fruits and green ones too..." The woman spoke like a bird singing a sweet song, trying to draw all the child's attention over, "You are like my own child, you must listen to me, no one dares to bully you."</p>
<p>The tears in the little child's eyes quickly evaporated. Many delicious things were placed in front of her. Several other children came to play with her, and she lived happily. In the morning, Grandpa Huang even brought some snacks back from the teahouse for her.</p>

<p>Economic Special</p>
<h3>This Quarter's Foreign Trade and Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>— Di An</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>According to customs reports, China's foreign trade in the first quarter of this year has declined even more than last year in terms of imports and exports, and its decline compared to the year before is even more alarming. This rapid decline in foreign trade, needless to say, demonstrates the seriousness of China's economic crisis; and with the overall national economy trending towards collapse, there are currently no factors for optimism regarding the advancement of trade. Instead, it is like a person selling blood, who, after having all their blood drained time and time again, may collapse on the roadside in a dizzy spell and be trampled upon by others.</p>
<p>Looking at the numbers, this year's first quarter imports were 289,814,000 yuan, a decrease of 96,960,000 yuan compared to the same period last year, a decrease of over 26 percent, and a decrease of 122,846,000 yuan compared to the same period the year before, a decrease of nearly 30 percent. This quarter's exports were 129,057,000 yuan, also a decrease of 28,625,000 compared to the same period last year, a decrease of over 18 percent, which seems not as drastic as the decrease in imports. However, compared to the same period the year before, there was a decrease of 92,937,000 yuan, a decrease of 42 percent, almost half, which can be said to be a drastic decrease. The following is a table: (unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Imports　　　　　　Exports　　　　　Total　　　　　　　Trade Deficit</p>
<p>First Quarter This Year　289,814　　　　129,057　　　　418,871　　　　160,757</p>
<p>Same Period Last Year　366,774　　　　157,682　　　　524,458　　　　209,092</p>
<p>Same Period Year Before　411,660　　　　221,994　　　　633,654　　　　189,660</p>
<p>In terms of total imports and exports, there was a decrease of 105,585,000 yuan compared to the same period last year, a decrease of over 20 percent in percentage terms, and a decrease of 214,783,000 yuan compared to the same period the year before, a decrease of about 34 percent. The total trade deficit was 160,757,000 yuan, a decrease of 48,335,000 yuan compared to the same period last year, and a decrease of 28,909,000 yuan compared to the same period the year before. However, the decrease in the trade deficit is not due to an increase in exports, but due to a drastic decrease in imports, so in addition to indicating a drastic decline in purchasing power, there is no improvement to speak of.</p>
<p>Looking at the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, the United States has had a significant increase in both imports and exports. Imports increased from 21.6 percent in the same period last year to 31.68 percent, and exports increased from 17.17 percent in the same period last year to 22.83 percent, so it ranks first in imports and exports. In the United Kingdom, imports decreased from 10.58 percent in the same period last year to 10.42 percent, while exports increased from 5.2 percent to 6.67 percent, ranking second in imports. Japan's imports decreased from 10.1 percent in the same period last year to 9.32 percent, and exports also decreased from 16.65 percent in the same period last year to 14.17 percent, ranking third. (unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Imports　　　This Quarter　　　　Percentage　　　Last Year　　　　　Percentage</p>
<p>United States　91,947　　　　31.68　　　　79,308　　　　21.60</p>
<p>United Kingdom　30,243　　　　10.42　　　　38,818　　　　10.58</p>
<p>Japan　27,008　　　　 9.33　　　　37,083　　　　10.10</p>
<p>Exports　　　This Quarter　　　　Percentage　　　Last Year　　　　　Percentage</p>
<p>United States　29,465　　　　22.83　　　　27,081　　　　17.17</p>
<p>Japan　18,280　　　　14.17　　　　26,259　　　　16.65</p>
<p>United Kingdom　 8,604　　　　 6.67　　　　 8,204　　　　 5.20</p>
<p>From this, it seems that the trade of other countries with China, especially Japan's trade with China, is decreasing year by year. The effect of the so-called rejection of Japanese goods seems to be indelible. But in reality, the decrease in Japanese goods is not as great as the statistics show. Although there are no statistics or investigations on the amount of smuggling, Japanese people, taking advantage of their geographical proximity, do smuggle and evade taxes on a large scale, which is certainly more than other countries. The "North-China Daily News" of April 22 had the following record: "In recent years, organized smuggling groups have imported sugar 'through the back door' into China, the amount of which is almost unbelievable... The quantity of smuggling last year, as proven, totaled 134,000 tons, but the exact number is probably not far from 200,000 tons. The smuggled goods come from Hong Kong, because sugar can be imported into Hong Kong duty-free, and from Taiwan, because Taiwan is a very convenient base for transporting goods to the Chinese coast. Occasionally, they come from the three northeastern provinces. Taiwan is a sugar-producing area, and the import of sugar has been increasing recently, which shows how serious the smuggling is." If it was like this last year, it is probably even worse this year. Sugar is like this, and other commodities also rely on smuggling. For example, the total value of artificial silk imported in the first quarter of this year was 489,614 gold units, a decrease of more than 70 percent compared to the 3,912,615 gold units in the same period last year. This huge decrease is not enough to be explained solely by weak purchasing power. Needless to say, this is also due to the increase in smuggled goods. And it is well known that sugar and artificial silk are Japan's main export commodities, so there is no need to doubt its intention to engage in dumping through smuggling in China. Therefore, the decrease in Japanese goods imports on the statistical table cannot be said to be a reflection of the actual situation.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>If people further study the customs report for the first quarter, they will be even more clear about the dumping of Japanese goods in China. Although Japanese goods generally tend to decrease in total trade volume, several commodities, especially those closely related to the Chinese people's lives, have seen a sharp increase in sales in China.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of artificial silk and its products, the increase in Japanese goods is very significant. Among the total import volume of 362,542 kilowatts (489,614 gold units), the proportion occupied by Germany was 150,396 kilowatts (225,486 gold units), a sharp decrease of one-third compared to the same period last year. Italian goods decreased by 88 percent from 620,843 kilowatts (1,023,710 gold units) last year to only 75,675 kilowatts (103,852 gold units), which can be said to be a tragic decline compared to occupying half of the total volume in the same period last year. However, Japanese artificial silk increased to 82,118 kilowatts (77,610 gold units), an increase of more than 180 percent, squeezing out Italy's position and taking the second place. The situation is the same with artificial silk fabrics. Although the total amount decreased from 85,223 gold units last year to 26,157 gold units, British goods decreased from 303,941 to 12,807 gold units, while Japanese goods increased from 1,271 gold units to 4,028 gold units, about four times as much.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk)　　This Quarter　　　　Same Period Last Year　　　(Unit: 1,000 Kilowatts)</p>
<p>Total Import Volume　　362,542　　　　1,279,732</p>
<p>Germany　　　　105,396　　　　446,896</p>
<p>Japan　　　　 82,118　　　　 28,765</p>
<p>Italy　　　　 75,675　　　　 620,843</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Fabrics)　　This Quarter　　　　Same Period Last Year　　　(Unit: Customs Gold Unit)</p>
<p>Total Import Volume　　 26,157　　　　 85,223</p>
<p>United Kingdom　　　　 12,807　　　　 32,941</p>
<p>Japan　　　　 4,028　　　　 1,271</p>
<p>If this alarming rate of increase is compared with the smuggled artificial silk imports mentioned earlier, it can be seen that the absolute volume of Japanese artificial silk imports is also very large.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the increase in seafood imports. The total import amount of seafood in the first quarter was 2,652,464 gold units, a decrease of 1,413,392 gold units compared to the 4,065,856 in the same period last year, a decrease of 35 percent. However, Japan's imports increased from 874,495 gold units in the same period last year to 1,028,005 gold units, an increase of nearly 18 percent. Japanese goods, which accounted for 21 percent of total imports last year, accounted for 40 percent in the first quarter of this year. Furthermore, China's fisheries have suffered because "in recent years, foreigners (Japanese) have been privately crossing the sea to fish during fishing seasons, resulting in reduced harvests for fishermen. At the same time, wooden sailboats have been sunk or damaged, and fishing nets have been damaged, resulting in huge losses. In addition, the prosperous fish markets, such as those in southern Shanghai, are mixed with Japanese fish, resulting in a sharp decrease in sales and a significant decline in the fishing industry" (Report on Fishery Areas in Eastern Zhejiang). The following is a list of Japanese fishery products dumped in China for reference by those concerned (unit: customs gold yuan):</p>
<p>Fish Name　　　　　First Quarter Last Year　　　First Quarter This Year</p>
<p>Total Sea Cucumber　　　446,932　　　　307,226</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　104,986　　　　105,125</p>
<p>Total Salted Herring　　　419,648　　　　533,951</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　 92,131　　　　 96,458</p>
<p>Total Other Salted Fish　1,431,438　　　　441,277</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　 38,652　　　　 52,989</p>
<p>Total Dried Shrimp　　　516,022　　　　278,861</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　 15,999　　　　 15,369</p>
<p>Other Fish and Seafood</p>
<p>Total　　　　　1,251,810　　　　1,091,149</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　622,591　　　　715,814</p>
<p>In addition, the sales of Japanese wool fabrics and serge in China are also very significant. Taking the first quarter of Shanghai's imports as an example, the total amount of yarn and wool fabrics was 1,886 hundred kilowatts, a decrease of 1,172 hundred kilowatts compared to the same period last year, and the price also decreased from 209,765 gold units to 371,743 gold units. Among them, British goods decreased by 178 hundred kilowatts to 1,136 hundred kilowatts, but Japanese goods increased by 39 hundred kilowatts to 244 hundred kilowatts, and the amount also increased from 35,083 gold units to 53,164 gold units. As for serge, its promotion can be said to be unprecedented. Both in quantity and price, it has overwhelmed British goods, which have been the dominant player for many years. In that year, British goods were 63,997 kilowatts, but this year they were reduced to 19,485 kilowatts, with only 44,512 kilowatts imported. Japanese goods, on the other hand, increased from 12,999 kilowatts last year to 59,901 kilowatts, surpassing the total amount of British goods. In percentage terms, British goods accounted for 63 percent of the total last year, but this year's first quarter saw a drastic decrease to 37 percent, while Japanese goods increased sharply from 13 percent last year to 50 percent. The rapid rate of increase shows how fiercely Japanese goods are being dumped.</p>
<p>Another product that has competed with British goods and won is the import of bicycles and their parts. The total import amount of bicycle parts in Shanghai in the first quarter of this year increased from 44,364 gold units in the same period last year to 86,581 gold units. Among them, Japanese goods increased from 18,848 gold units last year to 34,647, an increase of 84 percent. British goods increased from 18,968 gold units to 32,150 gold units, but their percentage was only less than 69 percent, not as much as Japan's (last year, British goods were more than Japanese goods).</p>
<p>In addition, there has been a considerable increase in wireless telephones, cement, etc.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>From the above simple examination, it can already be known that the dumping of individual Japanese goods in China is very fierce, and this trend has the potential to continue to expand. First, because the Anglo-Japanese trade war is brewing, the first to bear the brunt will be the Anglo-Japanese competition in the Chinese market. Japanese goods will use their "social dumping" policy to compete with British goods. In the simple narrative above, one can already get a glimpse of the fierce counterattack of Japanese goods. Second, because in the atmosphere of direct negotiations between China and Japan, the trade merchants of the two countries have had significant contact and tacit understanding. Where there is a profit to be made, there are merchants. Therefore, although the national masses oppose Japanese goods and boycott Japanese goods, merchants still promote Japanese goods as usual. If there are direct negotiations, these people can use the cover of "Sino-Japanese friendship" to wholeheartedly serve as pioneers in promoting Japanese goods, and Japanese merchants can take the opportunity to carry out larger-scale dumping. The flood of Japanese goods will completely submerge China's weak industry. Third, the Japanese government has proposed to China to reduce import tariffs on Japanese goods, and the Nanjing government has agreed to the request and is drafting new tax regulations. If the Japanese can get their wish, then the import of Japanese goods this year will definitely increase by leaps and bounds, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>The Pathological State of China's Finances and Its Reform</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>The National Financial Conference is being held in Beijing. In today's organized society, financial knowledge should become a common sense for the people because it is where our interests lie. Therefore, I draft this article to discuss it.</p>
<p>China has always had finances without governance. If there was governance, it could only be said to be the rulers' arbitrary spending and allocation. It was not until the establishment of the National Government that we could hear some calls for financial reform. However, the results of its reform have still failed to satisfy the people. Therefore, we naturally want to place infinite hope on this conference.</p>
<p>So-called finances originate from the common desires of the people, county residents, city residents, and villagers who live in a certain area. Because in the common life of human society, there must be a common relationship of interests. In order to build common interests and remove common obstacles, there must be an organ of power to represent the interests of the masses and establish an economic order based on material income and expenditure. Because the function and influence of this order have different regional scopes, it also distinguishes between local finance and national finance. The occurrence of finance is due to the purpose of improving and protecting the common life of the entire society. Therefore, the extraction of its financial resources should be based on the principle of equality. The payment of its various expenditures should be aimed at building social welfare. At the same time, in order to maintain this order in a rational state, efforts should be made to balance the fiscal budget for each year. However, in reality, this often becomes an illusion. Because society includes people of various classes, and each class has its own special lifestyle. Therefore, the desires and hopes of each class are inconsistent, and the principles of finance also differ greatly. Because a completely impartial world is indeed welcomed by everyone; however, it is rarely seen in real life. Regardless of ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, the distribution of finances is often unfair. The reason why Mr. Sun Yat-sen strived to advocate the collection of land value tax was to reduce the unfairness of the people's financial burden. Even Mr. Abe Kenichi, an economist and finance expert who is rooted in capitalism, clearly stated in his famous book "Financial Policy Theory":</p>
<p>People are controlled by their respective environments. Their opinions and desires are determined by their respective positions. Between people and classes whose opinions and desires differ, conflicts of interest arise. In fact, many financial legislations are determined by the rise and fall of the power of political parties representing various interests. ... The more distinct the interests and opinions in modern society, the more obvious the points of mutual rebellion. ... If we rashly establish a common and unified financial policy without examining the actual situation, it will be either a castle in the air or arbitrary.</p>
<p>Now we are very fortunate to be under the rule of the Chinese Kuomintang. The party's administration is striving for the national revolution and creating a political system for all people in accordance with the teachings of the Premier. Therefore, the financial principles applied in our country today must be based on the interests of all people. And our current hope is to realize this proposition.</p>
<p>China's finances have always belonged to a financial government. Since the accumulated malpractices have been around for a long time, rectification is naturally particularly difficult. However, generally speaking, the pathological state of China's finances is nothing more than two points: one is the problem of talent, and the other is the problem of distribution. There is a lack of talent, and there are few who are honest. The former cannot fully use scientific methods for rectification and transformation; the latter makes the administration smoky and miasmic, becoming a shortcut for personal enrichment. Customs and taxation, officialdom all regard them as vacancies, corruption and perversion of the law, and the appointment of private individuals are often heard. Now the country is vigorously carrying out the New Life Movement, and I sincerely hope that it can be rectified and cleansed. We already have high hopes for it, so it is not the focus of the topic of this article.</p>
<p>The theme of this article lies in the issue of distribution. The so-called distribution is how to extract financial resources and how to pay for financial expenditures. Therefore, within this issue, two aspects can be distinguished: one is the revenue aspect, and the other is the expenditure aspect. Only with income can there be expenditure. Living within one's means is the only way to balance finances. But now: the countermeasure to balance finances is always to advocate reducing expenditure and increasing revenue. If it is a genuine reduction of expenditure, it is originally a good thing. What is most feared is that the source is exploited without reducing the expenditure. Looking at the current situation in our country, unfortunately, it is exactly like this. Since there has been a national budget (is it really confirmed? Is it being implemented? That's another question), it can be said that this has been the case every year. But looking at the rate of increase in expenditures each year since the 16th year of the Republic of China, it is even stronger than the increase in revenue. Last year, it was considered to have a decreasing trend compared to the 20th year of the Republic of China. (In fact, it has not decreased in practice, and it must be even more. Because the Shanghai Incident occurred at that time, and the military expenditure must have increased greatly. But this increase was all automatically donated by the people; it was just not included in the budget.) But by last year, the fox's tail was revealed again. The expenditure last year was 788,346,637 yuan; last year it had increased to 828,921,964 yuan. The increase reached more than 40 million yuan. Therefore, in terms of revenue, efforts were also made to expand it. As a result, last year's revenue increased by more than 58.7 million yuan compared to the previous year. However, the result is still a deficit. The deficit is still more than 14,850 yuan. Therefore, after raising a 50 million US dollar cotton and wheat loan, a 100 million yuan customs treasury bond was issued soon after. Foreign debt and domestic debt are all available. The efforts of the financial authorities can be described as exhausting.</p>
<p>However, this pathological state is only a pathological state, and the source of the disease lies elsewhere. The source of the disease lies in the fact that expenditures are not reduced, but revenue is expanded.</p>
<p>There are two torrents in China's financial expenditure: one is transportation expenses, and the other is debt service fees.</p>
<p>In terms of national security policy and social security requirements, in the current world, the establishment of military police is of course indispensable. Especially in our country, which is being divided by the great powers and invaded by the violent Japanese today; any moving diplomatic rhetoric cannot change the border or repel the enemy troops. The only task of the Chinese army in the past was to create internal strife; not only wasting money, but also harming the people. Now, because of "internal pacification must precede external resistance" and "national defense must first ensure the people's security," the Red bandits and disobedient warlords have to be suppressed in every possible way, and of course, they are also fulfilling their great task of defending the country. It's just that the iron ships and cannons of the violent Japanese are oppressing us too wildly. We always feel that after spending this huge sum of money every year, we have not made considerable preparations for ourselves in national defense; we cannot help but call out our grievances.</p>
<p>Regarding China's military expenditure, taking last year as an example, its total amount has reached 415,600,000 yuan, accounting for 50.14% of the total expenditure. However, this is only for those within the reach of the National Government. In fact, many of the national tax items retained and allocated in Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Shanxi, and North China are not included. If we combine the statistics, the total military expenditure for the whole year is at least about 600 to 700 million yuan.</p>
<p>Like military expenditure, what is crushing China's finances is debt service fees. This is the inevitable result of borrowing and repaying debts. Borrowing and repaying debts was originally a temporary expedient to quench thirst with poison, but we have treated it as a routine and the only way to make up for the deficiency. From the first year of the Republic of China to the end of April of the 23rd year, a total of 59 types of domestic public bonds and treasury securities with the nature of public bonds were issued. It is estimated that the former Beijing government issued 28 types, the former Wuhan National Government issued 1 type, and the Nanjing National Government issued 30 types. The total number of issues reached 1,861,152,782 yuan in national currency. As of the end of April of the 23rd year, in addition to the 873,377,109.72 yuan that has been repaid and recovered each year, the total amount currently owed is 987,775,672.28 yuan in national currency. And the other short-term treasury securities listed in the "Table of Domestic Debts Operated by the Ministry of Finance without Definite Guarantees" compiled and printed by the former Beijing Financial Consolidation Association are about 70 types. It is estimated that the current outstanding principal is still 40,542,181.82 yuan. The first, second, and third lottery bonds issued by the former Guangdong National Government in the 15th year, excluding the principal that has been repaid and the tickets that have been cancelled, still owe 19,086,775.92 yuan in silver dollars. And the 3,326,546.50 yuan in silver dollars issued in the financial consolidation plan in the 17th year, totaling 22,413,323.42 yuan in silver dollars. Calculated at an 80% discount in national currency, it is 17,930,657.96 yuan in silver, and the Hankou treasury bonds issued during the period of the former Wuhan National Government, totaling 8,599,053 yuan in silver, are all added, then the total amount has now reached 1,054,847,565.02 yuan in silver. In addition to domestic debts, there are also foreign debts and indemnities. Therefore, the amount spent by the state treasury each year for the repayment of debts accounts for about 30% of the total expenditure for a long time. Taking last year's debt service fees as an example, it reached 241,841,804 yuan, accounting for 29.18% of the total expenditure. Combining the military expenditure, the annual expenditure of the two accounts for more than 80% of the total expenditure. Therefore, China's fiscal budget can be said to be just a payment budget for military expenditures and debt service fees. The expenditure of these two will make the existing financial</p>
<p>The total revenue of the three major financial sources (1) Customs duties (2) Salt tax (3) Consolidated tax is almost not enough to offset.</p>
<p>However, the original intention of finance was to improve the common life of the people. As a result, these two items account for more than 80%. Therefore, if the remaining 20% can all be spent for the benefit of the people, it would still be somewhat helpful. But in fact, in our country, there are numerous agencies and numerous items, so they are all allocated for official salaries and administrative expenses; what is left under the name of industrial fees, transportation fees, and construction fees is also only spent for administrative fees. What can really be directly paid for production undertakings is almost equal to zero, even if there is, it is only a few thousandths or ten thousandths. For the sake of clarity, the estimated budget for last year is listed below.</p>

<h3>Commercial News: No Change in Sunday's Interbank Call Loan Market</h3>
<p>▲ Minor Fluctuations in Subsidiary Currency</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and all banks were closed as usual, with only slight transactions in the money industry, so the market was not very volatile. In the market, the silver dollar call loan rate was six cents for both the morning and afternoon sessions. In call loan transactions, more than 3.8 million was transferred in the morning session, more than 100,000 in new transactions, and more than 300,000 in the afternoon session.

<h3>Abolish Next-Day Cash Collection for Remittances ▲ Mr. Pan Hengqin's Proposal</h3>
<p>The reform of next-day cash collection for remittances has aroused deep concern in the financial industry. Hangzhou money shops will implement changes from June 1st, with all inflows and outflows in cash and the abolition of the long-standing practice of interbank remittances, which can be said to be a good phenomenon in the financial industry. Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pan Hengqin, believing that it is a good opportunity to abolish next-day cash collection for remittances at a time when the Shanghai market is concentrating cash and the money industry is issuing excessive chips, and proposing the following abolition measures.</p>
<p>(1) The Bankers Association shall send a circular to member banks stating that from June 1st, "remittance" and "clearing" shall be used at the same time, remittance funds shall not be collected in cash the next day, and the "remittance" stamp shall be discontinued for new transaction instruments.</p>
<p>(2) The Bankers Association shall send a letter to the clearing house to transfer the "remittance accounts" of the exchange banks to "clearing accounts" from June 1st and record them together.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Finance shall send a telegram to the Money Industry Association, stating that from June 1st, remittance funds shall be paid in cash on the same day for banks and non-members alike, and the "remittance" stamp shall be prohibited from being affixed to new transaction instruments.</p>
<h3>Securities: Quiet Bond Market Trading Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, from May 21st to 26th, the Chinese Securities Exchange was in the last five days of futures trading for May. The market did not show any squeezing due to the proximity of the delivery period. The calmness of the market still did not escape the image of hovering and stagnation. Compared with the calm situation before the futures delivery in April, it was even more so. The swap trading between the long and short sides was still lively, but the market price was unexpectedly calm. The arbitrage trading in the financial industry also greatly diminished, resulting in the loss of part of the support force this month. The market price could not rise, and both floating longs and floating shorts were watching and waiting. Speculators were also discouraged, the market became more and more stagnant, and trading became less and less. The bulls believed that there would be no major events in the current situation, and that the silver market would be tight and the bond market would be high during the current silver season. The shorts were unwilling to cover, and the longs were unwilling to sell, so the price was like the waves in an ancient well. However, prolonged holding is bound to create a special situation in the future. Last week passed without any excitement for six days. Monday was slightly lower, Tuesday was slightly higher by one or two jiao, Wednesday showed a slight short squeeze, up three or four jiao, Thursday squeezed more, slightly lower by three, four or five jiao, Friday was the last day of futures for this month, calm and firm, continued to be slightly higher by two or three jiao, but there were also three types slightly lower by about one jiao. On Saturday, only one month of June was traded, and the tranquility of trading was unprecedented. However, the bulls temporarily pulled up slightly, and the market price was slightly higher by two or three jiao. As a result, the market price for the week was mostly slightly higher by one or two jiao to six or seven jiao, except for 96 and disarmament, which were uniquely lower by three or four jiao. This is because disarmament has always been extremely fierce in short squeezes, which has aroused the enthusiasm of longs, so it uniquely brewed a long squeeze. The circulation of cause and effect is very clear. The total number of transactions, including current and futures, totaled 65,367,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Lackluster Trading on the New York Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday's (26th) stock market trading was the quietest seen in two years. However, because there was no bearish atmosphere and the technical position was excellent, the market rose by more than one yuan. Speculators were very cautious, waiting for the results of the exchange case. American sugar factories rose due to the announcement of restrictions on beet sugar measures, while tobacco stocks rose due to widespread rumors that cigarette taxes would be reduced. Silver prices were firm, and the small exchange market was slightly better. Bonds were idle and mixed. US public bonds were calm, and high-grade railway bonds were also strong. Wheat was volatile, and commodities were clear and firm. According to agent reports, the (securities) market was sluggish, with minimal fluctuations. (Wheat) still has no rain, but according to the government meteorological station's long-term forecast, it seems that it will rain next week. Bullish profiteers have made some settlements, and they can buy in when it falls. Weather reports indicate that the weather in the spring wheat region is continuing to be unfavorable, hot and without rain. (Cotton) Currently, because cotton planting is progressing smoothly and yarn factories are reducing work, it seems that there is no upward trend. However, as soon as there are buyers, the market responds quickly. If there are changes in production news or other bullish developments, it is easy to rise. (Rubber) The market is calm, and brokers are slightly selling when it rises. Most of the transactions are swaps from July to December, with a discount of 60 pounds. (Silver) The market is very small and is controlled by government purchases. Half-day turnover was 280,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was sluggish, and peers were watching. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 pounds and futures rose by 7 to 10 pounds. The British cotton market was closed. The Indian cotton market was soft at first due to long profiteers settling, but then became firm due to Japanese merchants buying. As a result, Pingar remained unchanged, Omra rose by one rupee and two and a half jiao, and Bairoki rose by two and a half jiao.

<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoon Prices Haven't Dropped Much. ▲Leaf Prices in the Suzhou Area Soar</h3>
<p>▲In Huangze, Xinchang County, especially near Huangze, sericulture is most prosperous. This year, due to economic reasons, farmers were not enthusiastic about raising silkworms. Furthermore, many native silkworms were lost midway. Fortunately, the weather turned sunny and warm, and the silkworm rearing improved. Guidance on improved breeds was effective, and development became smoother. New cocoons entered the market three or four days ago. Cocoons from improved breeds were of the best quality, yielding about 60-70% of the expected harvest. Dachang and other cocoon exchanges successively opened their scales, competing to purchase high-quality cocoons from improved breeds. However, cocoon prices were restricted by regulations, and cocoon exchanges were unable to freely adjust prices. Farmers faced high costs, so the supply to the market was not smooth, and the number of cocoons purchased was limited. The highest price for improved breed cocoons was 35 yuan, and the lowest was 25 yuan. Native breed cocoons fetched a maximum of 25 yuan and a minimum of 15 yuan.</p>
<p>▲In Xiaofeng's four townships, silkworm rearing mostly involved native breeds. After the silkworm eggs hatched, the weather turned bad, and most of the silkworms were discarded during the second and third molts. Although improved breed silkworms hatched later, few were lost. With proper care, the new cocoons have already entered the market, yielding about 60% of a normal year. Improved breed cocoons are being sold at 30 yuan, and native breeds at 20 yuan. Zhenda Cocoon Exchange is purchasing the most cocoons. Improved breeds yield about 290 catties after drying, while native breeds yield about 300 catties.</p>
<p>▲Yangzhou is designated as an improved silkworm area this year. The improved breeds raised in various cities and villages are supervised by instructors and raised using new scientific methods. Although the weather has been unfavorable, few silkworms have been lost. Recently, the weather has been sunny and warm, and the silkworms are developing smoothly. The early batches have already emerged from their cocoons and are preparing to spin their silk, while the later batches are undergoing their major molt and consuming leaves vigorously. The supply of mulberry leaves is insufficient, and leaf prices have soared to around two yuan per dan.</p>
<p>▲In the Wuxi model silkworm area, although all farmers are using improved breeds this year, the instructors are working very hard to provide guidance due to the abnormal weather. During the third molt, the weather improved, and the silkworms developed rapidly. The early batches underwent their major molt and consumed leaves vigorously three or four days ago, while the later batches are starting their major molt. The silkworms are eating significantly more leaves, but most of the mulberry trees in the villages have been dug up for firewood, raising concerns about feeding the silkworms. There are too many silkworms and not enough leaves, causing leaf prices to skyrocket, with lake leaves rising to 3.70 or 3.80 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Silk Waste Sales to Europe Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Recently, sales of yellow and white silk waste to Europe have shown no improvement. Exports remain scarce. It is reported that last week, the Chinese Communist Party shipped 478 dans to Bombay, New York, and other ports via British and French postal ships.</p>
<h3>Grain: The Heshang Rice Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty suppliers arrived with their goods (4,500-6,600 piculs), consisting of roughly equal amounts of mid-season and late-season thick japonica rice. The market, after a price drop in the previous session, seems to be reviving slightly. The market appears more energetic from the start. If buyers continue to purchase from the North and South Ocean suppliers, 1,600-1,700 packages of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, and Xilian late-season rice will be sold. Bidding began, resulting in a price increase of nearly two jiao. Local shops also experienced increased activity. However, there is still a large quantity of old stock of thick japonica rice, which inevitably dampened the market to some extent. Therefore, the prices for regular supplies from Suzhou, Tongxiang, and Nangang are only slightly higher for fresh rice, while older stocks remain stable. Dujian also saw a slight price increase. Yangjian has not yet opened for trade. Bianyuan's buying interest suddenly waned, and it shows signs of softening. Yinyuan saw no market activity.</p>

<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various towns north of the river was slightly scarce, about eighteen or nineteen suppliers. In terms of market sales, White Japonica, Yangjian, and Bianyuan were slightly less active. Early rice and thin rice were still doing well. Dujian, Bujian, and Kejian were average. Upstairs bulk purchases were suspended. The market expects prices for high-quality White Japonica to remain high. Medium-grade early rice was slightly tight in the morning but strengthened slightly later. Yangjian was somewhat tight. High-quality Baiyuan saw a small price increase, while medium-grade and lower grades saw a decrease of one or two jiao. The prices for Dujian, Bujian, and Kejian remained similar to before. Early rice and thin rice are expected to be stable to weak, with medium-grade and lower grades seeing a slight price decrease of one jiao.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>The Coming Great War and the Way Out for Japanese Capitalism</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>If we are not "forgetful," then we certainly remember the circumstances and situation on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Most obviously, the ambitious German imperialism dreamed of hegemony, so on the one hand, it vehemently engaged in commercial warfare with imperialist powers such as Britain, France, and Russia; and on the other hand, it expanded its army and navy day and night to threaten the land forces of France and Russia and the navy of Britain. Therefore, it was inevitable that everyone would start a fire, launching a great massacre that moved mountains and overturned seas for several years. In the end, everyone was exhausted and temporarily suppressed the hegemonic Germanism. At the same time, the small countries dragged into the war were slaughtered like fish by the victorious countries to restore their own inherent glory. At the same time, we must also see the great changes that took place in the Tsarist Russian Empire, a participating country, at the end of the war.</p>
<p>At that time, the rulers only cared about frantically driving innocent people in the country to act as "cannon fodder" for them, for the motherland, for their duty. However, the forced lower classes in Tsarist Russia could not help but cry out: "Oppose continuing to participate in the war." As a result, a major change took place in this country, opening up a new path and a new development.</p>
<p>Similarly, at this time, we see that this Japan, which was only a silk-making industry in the era of the international division of labor in the pre-war international economic relations, has cleverly used "unfair competition" (recognized by various countries) under the economic nationalism during and after the war. It has also become an important role and a young warrior on the stage of international capitalism.</p>
<p>Originally, to use this "war to end all wars" 丨 European war, to achieve "once and for all" was what all the participating allied countries thought at the time. But in fact, it cannot be that simple and cheap. Anyone who pays attention to the various phenomena and changes since the First World War and the situation presented at this stage will not believe it.</p>
<p>Look! The "Continental Policy," "Dominating East Asia," which has been carefully planned for many years; the "Asian Monroe Doctrine," which is already in progress... These are the most obvious and open ambitions and strategies of Japanese imperialism, which is more powerful than the German imperialists during the First World War. It has long been recognized by various countries as the "enemy of industrial peace," and is engaging in commercial warfare with various countries in a longitudinal and horizontal manner. On the other hand, it is doing its best to expand its military, preparing to make a final resolution with them 丨 the Second World War, which is indispensable. But recently, we saw a news item from the China United News Agency in Tokyo in this newspaper, which is worth noting: "According to a survey by the Japanese military, farmers account for the largest number of Japanese men undergoing conscription examinations, accounting for 34% of the total; industrial workers account for 27%; children of merchants account for 17%; and the remaining 22%. The so-called farmers, industrialists, and merchants undergoing examinations are all proletarians, which shows that 78% of the Japanese army comes from the proletariat. The Japanese military is advocating foreign wars and must first resolve the unrest of domestic workers and peasants..." Indeed, this is not a joke.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, this is inevitable in capitalist countries, because in objective fact, industry always develops faster than agriculture in all capitalist countries. The reason for this is that every year, landlords must receive hundreds of millions of rent from tenant farmers, and soon these funds will become valuable securities, stocks, bank deposits, and similar things. Therefore, these hundreds of millions of yuan are all gone from the countryside and never return, which undoubtedly creates a sharp opposition between the city and the countryside. This is also the constant internal contradiction in capitalist countries, and this contradiction is exactly what various capitalists want to solve through the exploitation of colonies. But at the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that as national wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, it naturally expands and develops the union of the entire working class. Furthermore, due to the poverty of the masses and the unavoidable continuous struggles of the plutocrats and warlords, and the "aggressive militarism" of the rulers to compete for hegemony, the general public's dissatisfaction and disgust with the current situation has increased, thus causing various open resistance movements to spread widely. This is not only the case for Japanese capitalism, but also a huge contradiction that can never be eliminated and is increasingly sharpened on the stage of international capitalism within all capitalist powers and international capitalism.</p>
<p>But today, we have reached the eve of the Second World War. No matter how much stronger this is than the German imperialism during the First World War, and no matter whether it is acting as a pioneer for capitalists to gain their sympathy and start a war with the socialist country of the Soviet Union, or whether it simply cannot tolerate it and will fight to the death with other imperialists, soldiers, "cannon fodder," will ultimately be needed in wartime! But due to the objective facts of the past, people generally acknowledge that "war is often the yeast of revolution" 丨 the Tsarist Russian Empire is the most enlightening evidence. Then, what is the way out for Japanese capitalism in this war? I think it is "self-evident." Although there will be delays, we cannot assert that, but this is only a matter of time!</p>
<h3>Mr. Ma Er's "Not Speaking"</h3>
<p>— Shao Cen</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Er has been cultivating his mind and reading books on Mount Tai, and has not made any speeches for a long time. For a time, he seemed to be forgotten.</p>
<p>This time, it was probably a whim, or he didn't know what he ate wrong, and felt uncomfortable, so he had to come down Mount Tai and wander around.</p>
<p>I think, reading on Mount Tai is a wonderful thing, quiet and elegant, suitable for cultivating one's mind and preparing to govern the country and bring peace to the world. However, Mr. Ma Er ultimately felt too lonely. Moreover, reading is just a method, and it is nothing more than a last resort.</p>
<p>Chinese officials do not need to read or not read. As long as you have a gun in your hand, occupy a territory, and then you are a prominent official. Isn't that right? Our Mr. Ma Er used to be a military man, and later served as the commander-in-chief, which was a remarkable position. And he is full of knowledge.</p>
<p>Chinese military politicians are ultimately different from foreigners. When they are in power, they understand everything, are proficient in everything, and can do everything. Their ability is so great that they become omnipotent. However, once they lose power, they understand nothing, feel their own shortcomings, and then read, investigate, and travel, busy all the time. This is just a means.</p>
<p>When they are in power, they are mute. When they are in the wild, they are tigers, they are cuckoos. They can startle people with a single roar, and they can harmonize with a hundred songs. However, once they are on stage, they are different from before, and they are also mute.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Er's "not speaking" in Penglai this time was a big complaint, which is very pleasing to our people.</p>
<p>Because he wants to save the country, but he has no opportunity to save the country. He wants to resist the enemy, but he has no authority to hand over to him. He is always regarded as an outsider, and he is not allowed to step into the gate. This is even more infuriating for Mr. Ma Er.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Er is idle now, so he is in a relatively clear mood, knowing the pain of not being able to speak. Knowing how unspeakably painful life is under oppression. But, don't forget this. This is a fact. Don't just talk, hoping to win the sympathy of the people. When you take office as a high official, you are no longer angry, no longer bitter, and no longer have to say anything. The environment is different. This kind of thing is commonly used by Chinese figures in the wild. It is only the people who suffer.</p>
<h3>Seriousness</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>"Turning big things into small things, and small things into nothing" is our Chinese philosophy of life. Whether it is dealing with people or handling affairs, it always starts out fiercely and enthusiastically, but after a while, it becomes perfunctory and vague. The so-called tiger's head and snake's tail refers to this. From this, it is enough to reveal the Chinese people's not very serious attitude towards handling affairs.</p>
<p>However, the so-called not very serious has a limit. This limit depends on the current situation and how the matter affects one's own interests. If one is a strong person, even if it is a small matter, one must handle it thoroughly and seriously.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>For the sake of being serious, it doesn't matter even if the most harsh and cruel means are used against the other party. However, if one is a weak person, or if the situation seems unfavorable to oneself, one first makes a show of force and makes a threatening gesture. If the other party is not intimidated, one uses the phrase "I'll settle the score with you tomorrow" to cover up for oneself and slips away in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese scholars, whenever their official career was prosperous and everything went smoothly, admired Confucianism and taught people to abide by the way of "the ruler is the ruler, the minister is the minister, the father is the father, and the son is the son," and each should be content with his lot. However, once they were frustrated and down on their luck, they turned to promote Buddhism and Taoism, denouncing being an official as base and inferior, far less comfortable and noble than becoming a monk and living in seclusion. Zuo Si, who wrote "The Three Capitals Rhapsody" and caused the price of paper in Luoyang to soar, can also be considered very detached and seeing through the world, but reading his "Ode to History," why doesn't he have the desire to be an official? Li Bai, the poet immortal, can also be considered lofty and unrestrained, despising fame and fortune, but reading his "Letter to Han Jingzhou," why isn't he eager for Jingzhou to use him? Although some of this can be said to be due to people's selfishness, the lack of seriousness towards things cannot be said to be not a factor.</p>
<p>Reading world history to the point of admiring Sakyamuni, who abandoned his crown in order to save all sentient beings, and Socrates, who calmly took poison for the sake of truth, I always sigh and admire their great spirit of seriousness!</p>
<p>Why is it that our vast China never sees such serious people appear? Is "not being serious" originally one of the manners of our country?</p>
<h3>The Barber Shop</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>I am afraid to go to barber shops in my life, for three reasons:</p>
<p>First, I like to move. I can't stand being restrained. It is more miserable than being in prison for me to sit in a barber shop for more than an hour. In particular, you have to completely obey the barber's orders. If he tells you to straighten your head a little, you straighten your head a little, and if he tells you to tilt it a little, you tilt it a little. This kind of mechanical and boring work is really unbearable for a moving youth.</p>
<p>Second, I have neurasthenia. I like to daydream. I often think like this: What if the barber accidentally cuts into my throat with a razor, or scrapes off my scalp with scissors: Or if the electric face massager leaks electricity... What should I do? The more I think about it, the more afraid I become, so that as soon as I see a barber shop, it's like seeing a tiger.</p>
<p>The third reason, which is also the biggest reason, is that I am afraid of seeing the poor, mournful faces of the young apprentices in the shop. When I see them, I feel sad, and I feel that there is no one more pitiful than being a young apprentice in the world.</p>
<p>Once, because my hair was really too unsightly, I gritted my teeth and rushed into a barber shop. As usual, a young apprentice handed over a cup of tea and a hand towel. The young apprentice was only eleven or twelve years old, with a yellowish complexion and no blood at all. Even stranger was that his eyes were swollen like walnuts, and there were two crystal tears hanging from the corners of his eyes. As soon as I saw his appearance, I knew that he had been wronged.</p>
<p>I unintentionally talked to the barber about that young apprentice. At that time, I asked him why he was crying with his eyes swollen.</p>
<p>The barber smiled faintly and said, "He was beaten by the master."</p>
<p>"Why did you beat him? How pitiful!"</p>
<p>"He was courting death himself!" The barber said indifferently, "Just now a customer came, and the master told him to pour tea. He was stirring rice and, in a hurry, knocked over a basket of rice! He really deserves to be beaten. He doesn't pay attention at all."</p>
<p>"Isn't he still very young? It's hard enough for him to do this and do that!" I took a breath.</p>
<p>"Young? He's thirteen years old! He won't be human if you don't beat him!"</p>
<p>I was silent. I have no way to help those poor young apprentices. I am ashamed and dare not look at those poor faces again.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am afraid to go to barber shops. Unless my hair has grown long enough to be considered a prisoner, I reluctantly go once. As soon as I step into a barber shop, I immediately close my eyes.</p>

<h3>On Writing Brushes, Ink, and Paper</h3>
<p>— Wenli</p>
<p>Some people say that writing brushes, ink, and paper are closely related to a country's culture. Savages have no writing brushes, ink, or paper, so savages have no culture. At first hearing, this seems very reasonable, but this cannot be said of modern culture in the modern world. If you ask further, in ancient times, there were no countries with writing brushes, ink, and paper. If we examine ancient China, the records of articles used lacquer paintings, so naturally there was no ink or paper, and the writing brush was naturally not the writing brush used now. At that time, the ancients wrote books using bamboo slips painted with lacquer, and then bound them into volumes with leather straps. Confucius read books and broke the straps three times. It was already very difficult for the author to write a book, and it was even more difficult for the librarian and the reader. However, ancient people studied harder than students in the more scientific and enlightened era. From this point of view, it seems credible that the style of study is not as good as in ancient times. But let's not talk about this. It is said that since ancient times, the writing brush has had a particularly close relationship with literati. In historical records and poetry, writing brushes are mentioned more often than ink and paper. The ancients even had the saying "dreaming of a brush growing flowers" as a sign of writing a good article. In the imperial examination era, the god of the literati, Kui Xing, also held a large brush in his hand, and "Romance of the West Chamber" also praised its divine power, "The tip of the brush sweeps across five thousand people." After the invasion of Western culture into China, the writing brush has been greatly affected by fountain pens and pencils. This year, the Guangdong government ordered the promotion of students to use writing brushes to stem the leaks, which is the meaning of preserving the national essence. Not only is the writing brush already in danger, but have fountain pens and pencils not been subject to wave washing? In foreign countries, literary writers who use typewriters, as well as shops, companies, and government agencies, all use typewriters to write articles and letters. In the future, the writing brush will probably have nothing to do with culture. As for ink, in China, it occupied the position of lacquer and replaced it. However, now people who use fountain pens and pencils have replaced it with ink made from chemicals. In the future, when there are fewer people using writing brushes, ink will also decline. Chinese paper is even more sad. Now, except for the Xuan paper used by painters and calligraphers, only the paper used for shop ledgers is a domestic product. Books and newspapers (except for Lian Shi paper) all use imported goods. However, whether paper is a domestic product or an imported product, it is still paper, not like ink, which is completely replaced by chemical ink, and not like writing brushes, which will be washed away by typewriters in the future. Moreover, the more developed the cultural enterprise, the greater the use of paper, and in the future, paper will be needed by everyone.</p>

<h3>Weak Women Under the Tyranny of Feudalism</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am now sending you the true story of a weak woman under the tyranny of feudalism in the Fifth District of Yi County, who suffered abuse from her wicked mother-in-law, was abandoned by her husband, and was aided by her brother and sister-in-law in her suffering. Unable to survive, she died with resentment. I urge you to publish it in your newspaper and add fair comments so that not only will the deceased's grievances be slightly relieved, but also those who are concerned about women's issues can clearly recognize the direction of their efforts.</p>
<p>You Fengyi was the eldest daughter of Xinyou of Fanxi Village in the Fifth District of Yi County. Her family was poor. From a young age, she was betrothed through a matchmaker to Ye Yucun, the eldest son of Ye Fangguang of Nanping Village in the same district, as his wife. After she married into the family, they initially lived in harmony. However, after Fangguang's third daughter-in-law married a wealthy woman, her mother-in-law suddenly changed her attitude, favoring the rich and oppressing the poor. She used all kinds of coercion. All the hard work, such as planting in the courtyard, was borne by her alone. If she occasionally did not do things to her mother-in-law’s liking, she would be whipped. Still, she had to force herself to be happy and endure it, daring not to complain or resist in the slightest, otherwise, the abuse would be escalated, and she would be forced to perform humiliating rituals (rituals of feudal tyranny) before it would stop. Therefore, Fengyi often had no intact skin on her body, covered with wounds, but she still dared not slack off in her hard work for even a day. The second daughter-in-law was also from a poor family, and although she suffered the same abuse, it was not as severe as Fengyi's suffering. The third daughter-in-law, on the other hand, was idle all day long and instead helped her mother-in-law abuse and humiliate Fengyi. As for her husband, every time he returned home, he glared at her coldly, treating her like a stranger, even ordering her around like a servant and cursing and beating her. Fengyi's suffering was truly beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>
<p>After separating the cooking from her mother-in-law (note: they still lived in the same house, but only separated the cooking; all expenses had to be covered by her own needlework), she only received fourteen yuan from her husband in three years. In this time of high living costs, what use was this meager sum? Her husband occasionally stayed at home and still had to spend her savings. He was not unemployed, and his income was enough to support his family, so how could this not be intentional abandonment? Fengyi was a woman from an old family, and only a harmonious relationship between husband and wife and a good relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could provide her with support. Now that her situation was like this, what else could her husband say? She could only lament her unfortunate fate. Last spring, her younger brother returned from Shanghai. Fengyi repeatedly tearfully told him about her suffering and explained her difficult situation. If things continued like this, she would inevitably be broken and die. Her brother could not think of any other way, so he comforted her in every way possible and helped her renegotiate the separation with her mother-in-law, hoping to alleviate her troubles. Little did he know that her mother-in-law intended to make things difficult and提出许多苛刻条件,迫令承允,鳳意無法,一一服從. Therefore, even though they separated, her mother-in-law's oppression did not stop at all. The beatings and curses continued as before; her husband also glared and shouted at her incessantly. In this environment, Fengyi had no reason to survive. Now, her fragrant soul is gone, and she has indeed gone to the Yellow Springs, alas! It is so tragic!</p>
<p>Fengyi had no parents, only a weak younger brother. After Fengyi's death, her brother, with no one to turn to, lamented his loneliness and helplessness. How could he avenge his sister? I am deeply angered and exhausted by this, so I dare to implore you, sir, to provide guidance and a way to avenge Fengyi. I would be extremely grateful. I respectfully wish you peace.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Yu Baishou</p>
<p>Editor's Note: A life story like Fengyi's and the humiliation she suffered are not uncommon in this society. In my opinion, there are many people with the same fate. If Fengyi were alive, there might be ways to remedy the situation, although it would not fundamentally liberate her. However, she is now dead, so what way is there to avenge her? Even though she was forced to death by her mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and husband, can we accuse them of murder? What "fair comments" can I add? However, exposing this fact may allow those "who are concerned about women's issues to clearly recognize the direction of their efforts." Therefore, I have decided to publish this letter.</p>

<h3>MADAM X (6)</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>"Little Wang!" floated softly from her blood-red little lips, as she made another face.</p>
<p>Kao Ermen's eyes glared fiercely at the dancing girl who spoke. His right hand tightly embraced her snake-like waist, and she twisted her body, smiled, and whispered, "Don't be like that!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Yin." His sideburns brushed against his Schiffley nose.</p>
<p>The music stopped, and Min Sun helped Mrs. Yin back to her seat.</p>
<p>"That dancing girl knows you, right?" Mrs. Yin asked.</p>
<p>The gentleman nodded.</p>
<p>"Shanghai women aren't as pretty as those in Beiping!" This sentence was only meant for the beautiful lady in front of Min Sun.</p>
<p>"Beautiful Beiping lady!" The gentleman lowered his head slightly from the small table and whispered.</p>
<p>"But Beiping men aren't as handsome as those in Shanghai!"</p>
<p>Satisfied, she twisted her Schiffley mouth, straightened her tie, and the music started again.</p>
<p>Shanghai has no time, and the dance floor has no days. Every heart wants to satisfy its desires from the other's body. Soft flesh and hard coins are exchanged. Oily sweat flows, mixed with powder, drinking blood-red cocoa, the soul spinning in the rhythm of the music, once, twice, five times, tense faces, excited hearts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yin's hand, slightly panting with fragrance, pillowed her head, and the amorous gentleman, like a spring breeze, blew at her temples: "Mrs. Yin, let's go upstairs."</p>
<p>Supporting her snake-like waist, he returned to room 356 like a Roman warrior.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yin removed her black coat, blocking the oncoming spring breeze, and asked the waiter for a brandy. She tilted her head back and poured it straight down her throat.</p>
<p>The gentleman also felt slightly tired, threw himself into the sofa chair, and took out a silk handkerchief from his collar to wipe his forehead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yin, like a magician, regained her liveliness, playfully jumping in front of Min Sun, her breasts seeming to jump out of her silk shirt, Kao Ermen's eyes following that apex.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at? Haven't you seen enough?" With a twist, she threw herself into the gentleman's arms.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Yin!" His heart flew out of his chest.</p>
<p>"Chicken liver! Do you think I'm Jun Yang's wife?"</p>
<p>???</p>
<p>"Handsome Shanghai man!" She hooked his neck with both hands and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Who are you anyway?"</p>
<p>"MADAM X."</p>

<h3>The Petty Bourgeoisie and Chinese Cinema (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Some petty bourgeois have found the correct worldview under such circumstances, but most still linger in their original backward worldview. However, they have gradually realized that mysterious dreams are unreliable. Therefore, the faint dissatisfaction with reality in martial arts films became more distinct and profound in "Twin Sisters," and the mysterious color of martial arts films was replaced by the illusion of blurred boundaries between classes.</p>
<p>Due to the historical development of the "civilized drama," it was very much in contact with social reality. Every sensational yellow news story could always make a splash on the stage of the civilized drama. However, it was not necessarily performed according to the original facts but had to be adapted. The adapted material could very well express the backward worldview of the petty bourgeoisie and cater to their low tastes.</p>
<p>However, in recent times, we can generally see works of anti-imperialist hero worship, and "Twin Sisters" has even been brought to the stage of the civilized drama.</p>
<p>So, how will Chinese cinema win over the broad petty bourgeois audience? Will it take the path of "Twin Sisters" or even the civilized drama? Or will it take a different path?</p>
<p>The success of "Twin Sisters" proves that the broad petty bourgeois stratum is indeed very dissatisfied with reality, but "Twin Sisters" draws illusions from this dissatisfaction with reality.</p>
<p>This illusion actually exists, but the representatives of the petty bourgeois consciousness do not see the inevitability of their illusion's demise. As a result, they emphasize this illusion and distort the facts.</p>
<p>If we can learn something from "Twin Sisters," it is the exposure of the ugly reality, which expresses the dissatisfaction of the petty bourgeois stratum with reality.</p>
<p>However, the illusionary component of "Twin Sisters" is ultimately undesirable. If we want to win over the petty bourgeois stratum rather than follow it, we must discard this illusionary component and give them adequate enlightenment based on their dissatisfaction with reality as much as possible.</p>
<p>So-called acting based on the petty bourgeoisie’s dissatisfaction with reality does not mean taking the petty bourgeois worldview. Because starting from the petty bourgeois worldview will always obscure some facts, only thorough realism can movingly express it.</p>
<p>Here, the winner will surely be thorough realism. (End)</p>

<h3>Review of "Widow's Gold Rush"</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Havana Widows Nanjing</p>
<p>"Havana Widows" is not about women who have lost their husbands in Havana, but about two singers who see their old colleague sell her body and become a wealthy young woman, making them envious and go to Havana to find their buyers.</p>
<p>The vanity of these two singers seems laughable, but we only need to think that everyone has a desire to live better. The former singer and the current wealthy young woman, Grandy, are of course a temptation for Mei and Sati, who do not have a correct understanding. From this, we can know that vanity is not only a vice of people but cannot be dealt with by mere criticism. It is an inevitable product of an unreasonable social system, and it is not easy to break this concept without fundamentally reforming the social system.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can see that the rich men with big bellies have money, and the women have colorful bodies. Their purpose is the body, and their eyes only see shining gold. This is what is now called love!</p>
<p>Although Mei fell in love with the rich man's son, Pablo, for money, she can only love the rich man. Only when Pablo also becomes a penniless poor man can they be together, which precisely shows another side of the so-called love game.</p>
<p>The singers had to borrow money with lies to go "gold panning," and what was the lie they made up? Mother is sick. This deeply depicts a naive young girl and is very good.</p>
<p>The rich man Deid fell in love with the singer, but in front of the jealous , he hurriedly covered up himself by scolding his son. This lovely satire stripped off the hypocritical clothes of the gentlemen!</p>
<p>The lawyer's design to extort money and Hanmen's forged checks are all living dramas that are staged every day in today's society.</p>
<p>However, these exposures only touch on the ugliness of male and female relationships, which is so insufficient. All the satires are also so weak. "Widow's Gold Rush" is actually just some expression of the petty bourgeois stratum's dissatisfaction with reality.</p>
<p>Let's see! After venting some repressed dissatisfaction, it ultimately comes to a happy ending, which is the same as dreaming of winning the lottery, although panning for gold has become an illusion.</p>
<p>Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell's acting skills, especially the former, are successful because they can grasp the personality of the role. This work is colored by the labor of the two of them, such as when they lied to Hanmen and when they dealt with Diego.</p>
<p>The director's technique is still dutiful, but some unnecessary gimmicks are its shortcomings.</p>
<h3>Review of "Red Pink Reporter" Hold That Girl Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>All the ugliness of reality is covered up by the pink comedy color.</p>
<p>Reporters and detectives are both loyal ministers of the current social system, while bandits and villains are all parasites of the current social system. Therefore, in the eyes of the failing film story writers who maintain the current social system, their loyal ministers must be rewarded and given complete compensation, and their parasites must be punished and given the deserved retribution.</p>
<p>The capable female reporter and the brave detective got a complete marriage, and the bandits and villains all died under the overturned car. These are precisely the intentions of the "Red Pink Reporter" writers, who inherit their master's will to "reward the good and punish the evil."</p>
<p>In order to lengthen the thousands of feet of film and to increase the effect of the final complete marriage, according to the old example, the screenwriter of "Red Pink Reporter" inserted the reporter's news interviews. She was imprisoned for interviewing a madman, imprisoned for failing to get an appointment for a conversation, and imprisoned by bandits when the jewelry store was robbed and she went to investigate. The screenwriter here came up with three imprisonments of the female reporter. Fortunately, our brave detective rescued her three times, and the bandits were wiped out, showing the detective's deep kindness. The plot is extremely tortuous, and the final happy ending also got a great effect, and the thousands of feet of film were lengthened.</p>
<p>However, the old-fashioned directing techniques, the old-fashioned absurd jokes, the old-fashioned imaginary coincidences, and the old-fashioned romantic comedy, I am afraid that even the initial intention of the above-mentioned screenwriter cannot be completely achieved.</p>
<p>Absurdity, childishness, jokes, and finally, still unable to avoid the stereotype, they come up with a set of sensual dances. Is all this the true price of film art? Is it the softness of soft film?</p>
<p>However, we still cannot ignore that "Red Pink Reporter" tells us the detective's bravery, grace, and elegance, and hides the cruel face. How fierce is the truth hidden behind the beautiful screen! The cruelty of the electric chair, the recent shootings and beatings on the American docks, and even the fierce pursuit in "The Fugitive," these are all iron-like facts!</p>
<p>But, in "Red Pink Reporter," all the ugliness of reality is covered up by the pink comedy color.</p>
<p>Audience Comments</p>
<h3>After Watching "Red Pink Iron Blood"</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>According to the plot, we know that this "Red Pink Iron Blood" is a work that exposes the evils of the old warlords, but because the author neglects the great reality and only progresses from the story of women, it still has no impact on the country and society. At most, it is just an "internal dirty history" of the old warlords!</p>
<p>From the performance aspect, we can see the author's carelessness. Like the zoo scene at the beginning, such a long close-up, but besides the actors, not only is there not a single tourist, "there is simply not even a gardener." Like the brigade commander's headquarters, the situation is not small, but the picture shows a few doors, which are all made of paper. When the brigade commander was killed, many guards actually pushed hard but could not open them, which is too close to being comical. The remaining few snow scenes are also not satisfactory to us, especially the last dragging of that "bright tail" is even more boring!</p>
<p>Actor Wang Yuanlong is still the same as before. Tang Jie is the most realistic. Xiao Zhengzhong is completely acting in a civilized drama. The most unsuccessful one is Wu Yixiao's adjutant Ma. There is no performance of the personality at all. The director should also be fully responsible for it.</p>
<h3>Minor Talks on the Philippine Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>In the Philippines under American rule, undoubtedly, most of the films are supplied by the American film industry. So the American Silver Star is also very famous in the Philippines. It is said that among them, they are most welcome to Ping Crosby.</p>
<p>The Philippines also produces films themselves. There are three large photography fields in total, one of which is jointly established by American investment.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the climate in the Philippines is very hot, and after May, it gradually enters the rainy season, and it rains non-stop every day. For this reason, the Philippines is very unsuitable for filming, so movies will never have the hope of developing.</p>
<p>In addition to silent films, the dialogue in sound films is in the local dialect near Manila. So we can imagine that their sound films, except for Manila and its vicinity, cannot be widely screened in various places. As for Philippine silent films, in order to suit the conditions of various places, the films have three kinds of subtitles: English, Spanish, and Manila dialect.</p>
<p>Movie theaters are set up in major commercial ports in the Philippines, some of which are even more magnificent than the Grand Shanghai and Grand Brightness in Shanghai. Their tickets are sold very expensively, mostly one peso (equivalent to 1.78 yuan in Chinese currency) to about three pesos. They are mostly screened three times a day. However, first-class cinemas only screen at night because it is too hot during the day.</p>
<p>The promotional methods of Philippine cinemas when changing films are very interesting. They all use cargo trucks, hang photos of the new film on both sides of the truck, play gramophone records, and parade around.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Emerging Water Lily (Liveh—Never Againl) (1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Produced by Wufa Company, starring Li Lin Hawei</p>
<p>The cloud-scraping houses are arranged in layers; the fast-moving vehicles drive back and forth; and there are also the colorful neon signs, flashing on and off; the jazz music of the song and dance halls is playing on and off. The scenery of this metropolitan night is so intoxicating! At this time, in front of the gate of a magnificent and splendid apartment, three or four gentleman-like men walked in. They came to a door with a copper plate with the name of McPherson nailed to it and stopped. The doorbell rang loudly, and a servant ran out. They broke into the room without waiting for the servant's permission,</p>
<p>The protagonist, McPherson, is a playboy. At this time, he was in the inner room, fooling around with a woman he had known for only three weeks. Suddenly seeing a few strange men break in, he was shocked, "She is my wife, do you dare to seize another man's wife?" Among the men who came in, one with a beard pointed at Mack and shouted like this. Mack couldn't figure it out for a while. He said to the woman with an angry expression, "You never told me you were married. What's going on?" The woman stood aside shyly, without saying a word. Mack understood in his heart that he was caught in their trap again. He sneered and turned to the bearded man and said, "Okay, how much money? You say it!" The man stretched out four fingers and replied, "Forty thousand yuan!" Mack immediately wrote a check for 40,000 yuan and handed it to them. So the men and women exited like a gust of wind,</p>
<p>Qingen, Mack's confidant servant, calculated the expenses that the master had spent with women within a year, and the amount was indeed considerable. He thought that if this continued, he would have to enter the poorhouse in the future. Mack himself was also very discouraged because he had been cheated many times and thought that there was no reliable woman in the world. At this time, a close friend happened to visit, so he took a huge sum of 500,000 yuan and gambled with his friend that he would never get close to any woman within five years, starting from 5:30 pm on March 22, 1926, and invited Qingen to be a witness. Finally, he also told Qingen that he must monitor his actions at all times,</p>
<p>After signing the contract, they put on their clothes and prepared to go out; but looking out from the window, there were many women coming and going on the street. Qingen hurriedly stopped him and said, "This is so dangerous! You can't go out." Mack thought to himself that it was true, because the temptation of women is really not an easy thing to get rid of; but he can't stay away from this house for five years after all! So he hesitated again. Later, he suddenly thought of his yacht. He thought it would be better to escape to the sea, so he hurriedly instructed Qingen to go out and look for sailors; but there was one condition: the service period was five years, and they were not allowed to go ashore and approach women during the five years. Sailors are notoriously absurd. How can this condition be achieved? Qingen thought to himself, but the master's order cannot be violated, (to be continued)</p>
