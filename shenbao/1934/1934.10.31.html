<h3 id="c15">海軍預會席上之英日美 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>海軍預備會議在倫敦開會後。先由英美日三大海軍國個別會談。求政治外交軍事上意見之諒解。以爲明年海軍軍縮會之凖備。蓋各強國鑒於以往日內瓦軍縮會議之糾紛。恐再蹈破裂之覆轍。和平前途。更見危殆。故咸取鄭重態度。本年六月間英美初次恊商。即受挫折。延期三月。至今日英美對於海軍軍備之主張。是否已能接近。仍爲疑問。英日間在政治上雖有成立相當妥恊之趨勢。而在軍事技術。亦沿有難於相容之點。如日本提議廢止攻擊性質艦種之全部。航空母艦亦在其內之類。誠以日本四面環海。就地理論。固任何強敵。不易攻入。但自空軍逐漸發達後。由英格蘭至墨爾博恩之飛行。一萬一千二百餘哩之航程。其時間連加油休航在內。亦僅七十一小時。如此情勢。茍再進步。則日將天險盡失。一旦國際戰爭發生。空中爆炸。自爲日本最大之患。故提議軍縮。即注意澈底縮減此類之武器。然英國爲欲維持其海上覇權。統制其散漫之殖民地。并保守其廣大之海外市塲計。詎肯放棄此優良武器。自在意中。至潛艇之威脅。在過去大戰中。英已備嘗之。現在戰術愈見進步。潛艇製擊效能。必更擴大。英國海上商船爲當世第一。臨戰固可以改製帶甲巡艦。然終不足以敵大型潛水艦之暗襲。故力主廢除。日本則諉此爲防禦武器。不一定爲攻擊之用。故堅主保留。此種技術爭執。如不能消弭。則必將影響於整個妥恊。而陷英日交涉於殖局也。</p>
<p>至於美日間之軍備關係。與政治立塲。絕無調和餘地。緣遠東市塲之爭奪。日本自認爲地理王應有特殊優惠。美則堅持門戶開放。不許日人獨占。各欲貫澈其主張。不得不各自擴張其武力。在美國能保持以前之海軍優勢。所謂五。五。三比率存在之際-猶不免痛受西太平洋之打擊。而感軍力不敷之苦。今幸尚有華盛頓倫敦條約。以維持現狀。其主力艦雖不足以攻人。而自衛尚覺有餘。美國艦雖已次第老大不。及日本之新銳。然以天賦甚厚。物力人力之蘊藏。尚在發揮。重工業又正在推進。今日加工急速整備。自不難㧊足於太平洋也。且其航空進步。一日千里。茍一旦和平不克維持。攻守尚可自如。決不至一無辦法。</p>
<p>由斯以言。假使軍備平等。－英美日三國之海軍軍備平等。爲軍縮會議所共同承認。又縮小主力艦。廢棄航空母艦。美國軍力。似將退興法意爲伍。然亦豈肯放棄。遠東以與南美同屈於下位乎。吾人逆料會議前途。縱遇殭局。美亦寗不顧軍縮條約之成敗。而必堅執其現有主張。換言之。即不贊同縮小主力艦。增加經巡洋艦。廢棄航空母艦維持潛水艦艇等之條件也。惟此主張。適與英日所提者正相背馳。故在今日而欲求真誠之妥恊。實現互讓之精神。必爲事勢所不許。然則預備會議之前途。不可以預測乎。</p>

<p>倫敦　昨日午後英美代表在唐寗街相邸舉行第一次正式海軍討論、雙方比較其對於日本提案之印象、在英美開會前、日美代表曾作一度談話、歷一時半之久、晶代表在討論之際、續作關於日政府海軍政策之陳說、而對於海軍平等地位、發言尤多、並答覆美代表所發關於巡艦。飛機線艦。及潛艇比較用途之問話、美日會議後接開英美談話、故英美之談話有可特殊注意之處、英美談話亦歷一時半之久、出席者英方爲首相麥唐納。外相西門。海相孟塞爾。及海軍要人查斐爾德、美方爲臺維斯。海軍上將史丹德雷。及駐瑞士公使威爾遜、雙方皆有專家相助、其所討論者、爲日方海軍總噸數平等及戰艦與飛機母艦限制之提案、聞就會議時英美雙方所表示之意見察之、英美對此問題、當然立塲不同、需要各異、而對於主力艦之大小、竟見尤不盡同、但對於潛艇等數點、則雙方意見一致、如華盛頓海軍公約能繼續有效、固英美所原油也、�雙方皆覺欲求總噸數普遍平等與國防上各種需要兩事之互相融洽、將極感困難、預料各方面將作歷時頗久之努力、以期獲取一種恊定、英美代表皆以爲須鄧是日本以表明其地位之種種機會、痰盂以爲未可增加日政府之困難、各方面之談話將繼續舉行、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>日本要求足招競爭</p>
<p>倫敦　日美兩國代表在表面上依然繼續友誼的交涉、然兩方意見完全對立、且美代表已對英國露骨表示反對日本意見、海軍會談僅僅經過一週、已撞大暗礁、二十九日舉行之英美會談席上、美國某有力代表對於日本軍縮提案加以澈底反駁、其大意謂、平等海軍力未必保全平等安全感念、華盛頓條約對於簽字國興有平等安全、英美兩國並無變更現在海軍力之平均情態及安全程度、又華盛頓條約之變更、自然招致九國及四國條約、如承認日本主張之軍縮原則、則小國亦得建艦權、勢將誘致製艦競爭、採用總頓數主義、則各國研究製造珍袖戰艦製艦競爭更爲猛烈、現在殆無希望能於一九三六年後訂立海軍新條約、如新條約不成立、日本未必得實現與英美平等之海軍力、由此觀之、豫備會商前途頗多困難、（二十九日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　二十九日日美會談、美國代表臺維斯發出種種質問、日本松平山本兩代表答辯、美國態度尊重現實問題、主張維持現行條約、削減各國海軍力之二成、保持甲級巡洋艦之現狀、史丹萊提督及其他海軍代表因有羅斯福總統史璜生長官等後盾、態度極爲強硬、殆無接收日本提案之模樣、會談前途不無悲觀、（二十九日日聯電）</p>

<p>可不即行實際平等</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍談話會之美總代表臺維斯攖疾、故今日日美代表未開會、臺維斯因積勞致疾、渠望明日當可起床、故明日美代表團將至日大使署以聆日代表關於侵略與自衛武器之解釋、聞日本如獲各國承認其海軍平等權、則將作片面的允許、不將其海軍擴張至與各國平等之地位云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　軍縮會議進行之間、美國漸次表現其進政遠東作戰之本心、反對日本軍縮方針、日本當局對於美國如此態度、略抱如次見解、日本所主張者爲決定軍縮精神、樹立不侵犯他國之原則、故無論任何國家不應加以反對、美國如反對此項主張、則不能不認彼堅持進攻遠東作戰、日本國民視華盛頓條約爲過支時代之古物、且確信廢除此條約則可除支國際不安狀態、以致好結果、世界各國應有平等對立權、規定甲國可對乙國取攻勢而乙國不能整備防守之條約、太屬不公平、華盛頓會議後、遠東迭次混亂、誰可斷言此非諾條約之影響所致、廢除華府條約後、始得現慎實行九國及四國條約、故此兩條約並變更必要、日本之所論係與華府倫敦兩條約簽字國之海軍有關、並未論及其他小國之海軍力、據美代表之說、日本主張實現、則發起小國建艦競爭、然小國間從來未有造艦競爭、將來亦未必有之、美國反對攻擊兵器與防禦兵器之區別、然攻勢大者與小者之區別自然明暸、如有故意反對者、不外於堅持進攻遠東主義者、海軍會議前途不許樂觀、亦又不必悲觀、（三十日日聯電）</p>

<p>華盛頓海軍部長史璜生今日宣稱、明年之海軍操演將在太平洋東北部舉行、此言表示美國仍轉移其注意之軍事點至阿拉斯加及橫貫太平洋之弧形航綫、參加操演之戰艦約一百零四艘、操演之地點約在阿拉斯加、譜熱桑德及夏威夷一帶、如太平洋發生事變、則其地適當北美與亞洲交通之衝、外交界對此新形勢十分注意、但認其未有何特殊政治重要性、分注意、但認其未有何特殊政治重要性、其理由如下、一海軍之在此地帶活動、近兩月來已爲飛機及潛艇所威脅、二美國之海軍演習、幾已盡人皆知、蓋自大戰之後、除斐律濱及若干小島外、美國之其他屬地、及與美國鄰近之重要洋面皆曾舉行演習、美國艦隊演習、況曾直至南太平洋以及澳洲且於巴拿瑪運河舉行特別操演、又在加利比海形騰之區實習戰術、外國海軍觀察者因此咸認此次在太平洋東北部之操演、不過前此操演之繼續而已、然此太平洋之操演於外交上頗有關係、因此項操演頗足影響國際海軍條約廢止後之太平洋防禦問題（二十八日國民電）</p>

<p>此次新疆之叛變、原因複雜、初以金樹仁失政、（其詳細情形、因時間關係、不能多敘、）致釀成人民反對潮流、然尚無任何暴動趨勢、蓋因新疆民族、雖素有仇視漢人之心、然實缺乏自動能力、（民性多愚笨）若無外來勢力爲其主動、彼實無自動可能、今以甘肅亂首馬仲英野心不死、（彼原有竊據新疆以樹其回敎特殊勢力之企圖、此爲盡人皆知、無可讀飾者、）蓄意捲士重來、因鑒於去年在哈密倡亂之失敗、故除事先通知該處負隅之緾回外、復勾結省軍和晨馬福明（河州回敎）爲內應、（該團適駐防吐魯番鄿善一帶）、又因彼係新受中央之招撫、不便明開大隊入新、故僅派便衣隊三十七人先行來新、專事鼓動及煽亂之工作、一俟亂形擴大、省軍防不勝防時、再由彼等假託民意、請彼出關靖亂、彼可不動聲色、以遂其據有新疆之野心、而尤能以不脫離中央之假名義、控制英俄之攖奪、是其設計之狡、於此已可概見、又焉知彼無識之便衣隊、後見一路事皆順手、趁一時快意、遂不免在有意無意間漸漸流露於人矣、惟彼三十七人當出關後、因人數太少、知哈密有大隊堵防、不易越過、乃由間道翻山竄至鄯善、（其城近山）而達其目的地、因馬福明之內應、故鄯善吐魯番即相踵失陷、該匪等既擦有兩城之地盤、復有一團兵力、以及多數附和之緾回、聲勢日見浩大、此時省方之大軍、遠在哈密、且爲負隅之匪所牽制、祗得就近調隊往剿、然終以緾民衆多、不能克復、匪勢且日益蔓延、省方竟無法制止、叛軍於此時乃分軍兩路、一攻省城、一取南路、（即天山南路）其取南路之叛軍、藉鼓勳緾民之力、以致沿路各縣、均皆相繼失陷、旋即進據焉耆、並在該處設立總司令、號稱第三十六師焉耆剿匪事令部、此時喀什至迪化之交通、已經斷絕、以後所有文電、皆取道伊犁。繞冰達坂、至阿克蘇轉達喀什、每一消息需時二十餘日、呼願頓感不雲、而同時南疆各處緾民、亦皆蠢蠢欲動、多有暗備軍器者、如墨玉縣之查鐵棒案、英吉沙縣之查獲大頭棒案、（以堅木爲杵。長三尺餘。粗其一端。在粗端滿裝鐵釘、）雖經官方查覺、但恐激起民變、不敢追究、該緾民等窺破其隱、亦更肆無忌憚、其後大頭棒鐵棒等類、靡不人各一具、橫行鄉里、我漢人此時、感恐遭其襲擊、岡敢遠行一步、即令有事入鄉、亦須結伴攜械而往、然猶深抱戒心、不敢久滯、夫官方之怕激民變、事事包荒、固屬慎重之道、顧此種民變、現象已徵、即不激之、亦不免於暴發、無如官方不察、一味姑容、遂致造成今日糜爛之時局、夫復何言、當此之時、盤據焉耆之馬石明、即利用此種時機、派其黨徒、在論臺庫車拜城一帶、極力煽惑、並妄肆宣傳、（云係奉中央命令倒金救民）一般無知緾回、紛紛附和、庫車原係久反之地、（在民國七年及十二年已反兩次）該縣之緾民鐵米爾、（係庫車縣腳夫攬頭、在新疆則名車戶鄉約、）遂招集緾民、暗中活動、以致輪臺。庫車。托克蘇。沙雅。庫爾勒。拜城。等縣、相繼叛變、凡屬漢人之婦女、悉被姦佔、所有旅居以及永久住在該處之漢人、均遭慘殺、輪臺一處、較他處尤慘、聞所死之漢人、多係用棒打死、蓋彼時彼等所用之軍器、除奪得官軍之少數槍械外、其餘均係大頭木棒耳、此外所有漢人之財產、無論其物主存在與否、悉被攖奪一空、該叛軍此時之口號、以建設衣思拉木（按衣思拉木即回敎）爲號召、倡言殺漢興回、故南疆之緾回、遂被煽動、此時該叛軍將近阿克蘇、喀什噶爾之師長金樹智、（係金樹仁之四弟、毫無政治及軍事學識、性情驕奢、專事聚歛、）聞報倉皇、即派團長楊慶明、帶騎兵兩連、前信防堵、（一月三十日開㧞、）金師長猶恐兵力不足、更興道尹馬紹武（係雲南回敎）商議數次、以師部副官長李登龍爲援阿第二路指揮、正備出發、忽接到壘玉縣（在新疆南部距和閱四十里）緾民叛變消息、漢人自縣長以下、悉被大頭棒打死、和關。洛浦。于閵。等縣、旋亦相繼起事、皮山。葉城。澤普。葉爾㕗。莎車。各縣、亦皆紛紛告急、金師長見大勢已去、憂心如焚、次夜即宣布偶染暴疾身故、金樹智死後、兵權即歸於馬紹武、此時阿克蘇業已失陷、楊團長敗退巴楚、喀什回漢兩城、（即疏附一道尹在焉、及疏勒師長在焉）、風聲鶴唳極形危急、顧馬道尹原係回敎新敎之敎主、自料或能以同敎關係、平定民心、故即一面派人往和閨一帶宣慰、一面即令第二路援阿軍隊開㧞、迨行抵九臺、（係站名、在巴楚下二站、）即興叛軍相遇、兩軍相持將及兩月、其間喀什軍雖曾勝數仗、死敵近千、但以衆寡懸殊、軍心渙散、終歸失敗、李指揮陣亡、此時馬道尹適接省府來電、委爲南疆剿匪總司令、旋即由馬令委李之參謀司星洋（甘肅人）爲指揮、其人識寡年輕、且非隊伍出身、以致軍心不服、時起內訌、馬又續派師部參謀長兼團長劉鼎、（甘肅人）爲援阿第三路指揮、但劉因曾唆動前師長金樹智與馬紹武不睦、且庸碌無膽、在前綫又興司指揮意郵不合、時起糾紛、以致前方軍事、日趨混亂狀態、此時馬司令見前方如此情形、料難制勝、加以和閒等處宜慰無效、乃變計講和、委派代表前往歡迎叛黨來喀、雙計講和、委派代表前往歡迎叛黨來喀、雙方於是停止軍事動作、馬趁此停戰期間、即發電前方、飭劉密派一隊往和闐平亂、惟劉以叛軍未退爲辭、抗不用命、馬說莫可如何、當時即有馬素所信任之員司數人、獻策於馬、勸其招募布魯特人（一種素處深山之游牧、又稱黑黑子、簡稱布民）爲助、權濟一時之急、但又有人謂此冀原係不識人道饑噬飽颺之強悍馬賊、萬不能倚爲扶助漢人保衛疆土者、馬紹武考慮之後、終採用此策、不及半月、即招到七八百人、編爲一團、並給快槍四百枝、大砲兩尊、同時又招緾兵兩營、特務連一連、（係漢回混合）編制就緒後、即委連長陳某爲團長、（山東回敎）率布兵一團、開往蘇紅卡（通島什小路）、以防叛軍繞島什小路攻喀之策、並又加派新軍兩營、前赴皮山、堵截和閵。長玉。等處士匪來喀之路、查和閵暴動緣因、首由壘玉縣長閻某貪求無厭、又因其一任兩年、（新省自金樹仁登臺、規定每縣縣長任期、均以一年爲限、閻金同係甘肅人、故優興兩任、）且署內所用職員、概係當地一般刁棍、互相狼狼、遂致激成民變、於是叛首依米爾（墨玉縣人、年三十左右、係緾民學土、現稱怕下怕下即回王）糾衆暴動、攻撲縣署、洗殺閻某全家、旋攻破和闐、聞和闐漢人尚未多殺、但財產盡被沒收、形同乞丐矣、</p>

<p>— 續</p>
<p>保甲緾查程序爲三期、現在第三期工作已完成者有銅山豐縣蕭縣靖江啟東鹽城臯寗興化東臺實應等十縣、三期工作將要完成者有如臯南通宿遷崇明等五縣、三期工作正在進行者有沛縣贛檢邳縣睢寗海門淮陰等六縣、三期工作甫經開始者有泗陽塲山淮安等三縣、二期工作正在進行中者有東海灌雲沐陽等三縣、至於論到各縣工作的內容、有的縣份進度速而工作又切實又正確有的縣份工作甚正確切實而進度稍遲、有的縣份進度速而工作不正確不切實、甚至有少數縣犯了敷衍虛僞的毛病、我們所希望的第一是正確切實其次是迅速、爲了正確切實以致稍稍躭擱了時間、我們認爲是可取的、是有成績的、例如沛縣便是一個例子、最要不得的是敷衍塞責草草了事、這樣的工作、雖然把三期做完、我們定要罰他重做、這些成績坊的縣份、待將來全部工作完成後再行宣佈、總之這次江北各縣的保甲工作、銅山一區以內有幾縣辦得很好、東海區內有幾縣辦得也不錯、南通區的靖江也辦得還好、辦得好的幾縣、現在已大見功效了、徐海一帶、向來是多匪的域區、每逢青紗帳起、土匪羣起如毛、今年夏防能安然渡過、有好幾縣不能不歸功於保甲、最顯著的事實是一、壞人沒有人保、不能立足於社會、二、出了綁票案子、肉票找不到窩藏、還有幾縣能積極的利用保甲、利用保甲辦禁煙放足的工作、如蕭縣睢寗等縣風、在蕭縣也收了很大的功效、蕭縣人民有感於保甲的好處、許多鄉間素有深仇夙怨不相往來的兩姓鄙居、現在也樂於互相連保了、蕭縣的人民現在且自動的要求縣長延長調練保甲長的時間呢、大概的批評、這次各縣的保甲工作、是瑕作、切實努力、以至各縣編查的結果、大體尚不失正確、至於各縣編查的結果、大體尚不失正確、至於一般的缺點、便是缺乏事前準備的工作、第一缺乏宣傳的工作、不識字的人民自然人、如果沒有注意到保甲道個制度的意義、也不會明䜍他的功用、因此引起許多人們的懷疑誤會甚至糾紛、因此躭擱了工作的進行、如果事前有普遍的宣傳、有力的宣傳、這些麻煩自然會減少、甚至不會發生、第二缺乏訓練的工作、編查委員區長乃至縣政府內的辦理保甲工作的人員、都是實際從事保甲工作的人員、事前對之應有充分的訓練、對於保甲的一切法令規章、應使其澈底的明白、對於一切的實際的問題和困難、應使其有相當的解答的淮備、可是進步工作多數縣份未能充份的做、以致這些工作人員、實際工作的時候、時時發生硬的毛病、以致影響工作的效率、第三是缺乏聯絡的工作、辦理保甲是組織全縣的民衆、是與縣內的任何好人都有痛癢相關的密切關係、我們應該請縣里一切有力的團體有力的份子、共同參加、共同努力、如黨部。如學校。如民衆機關。以及其他一切正當的助乎、我們應該聯絡他們禮聘他們、如此、工作自然可以順利進行、各縣懂得這個道理而這樣做的固然爲數不少、但多數縣份未注意及此、單耳自已賣力、無怪各人做得力弱聲嘶了、</p>
<p>各位、現在舉辦保甲得到不少的便宜、江北各縣辦保甲的經騐、都成了我們的敎訓、我們的借鏡、我現在從實際經騐方面、提出幾件事來請各位注意、一、注意事前的準備工作、所謂準備工作、就是剛才所說的宣傳工作、訓練工作、和聯絡工作、還有其他物質方面的準備、就是一切用具的準備、凡事豫則立、不要臨渴掘井、乎忙署點、二、慎選編查委員、編查委員如果選得不好、編查的工作是無法做得好的、無責任心的人要不得、不能吃苦的人要不得、專混差使的人要不得、三遵守廳定的工作程序、廳定三期工作、一期有一期特殊性質、是有事實上一定的程序的、如果好奇、不依照這個程序、如果取巧、兼程併進、必然紊亂了步驟、必然得到不正確的結果、回頭重行整理、必然白費了許多時間和金錢、這是已經有了事實的敎訓的、四、慎選保甲長、保甲的目的是想團結好人、清除壞人、如果選擇保甲長不慎、把壞人反選擇了、那到不嫩不辦保甲之愈、果然將來發現壞人做了保甲長、我們要趕快一個各位易有指揮的地方、做一個編查試騐區、在這一區內把所有的編查人員、集中起來、做一個澈底的試騐與練習、然後漸給他區、這個辦法已經行之有效、各位值得仿行、六、切實取得連坐切給、連坐切結果保甲的精華、一定要依照規定的手續辦理、切切不可敷衍、不可馬虎、</p>
<p>最後、我希望各位第一要工作切實、萬萬不可稍存敷衍之心、我們辦這件工作、要一掃從前各縣辦人口、調樶辦信鄉等等一切敷衍虛煌毛病、否則便祗落得勞民傷財的結果、便是保甲的罪人、第二要工作迅速、敷衍固然要不得、遲綏也要不得、我們要一鼓作氣、一氣呵成、把各縣的保甲趕快組織成功、及早完成我們自治自衛的目的、但是有意遲延致礙工作的進程、固然不可、而有意取巧、有妨工作的切實、亦萬萬不可、第三希望各位常漃下鄉、按照限期進度表的規定、於第一期、親赴各區巡視、并召集民衆講述舉辦保甲的意義、於第二期、親赴各區巡視、對各區鄉鎮保甲長講演編查之意義及方法、於第三期親赴各區巡視、實地按表擇戶抽查、</p>

<p>廣東以保護工業出品爲由、對於外省國貨、運往粵省、特抽收入境稅至百分之二十、滬上運粵機製國貨、責令補稅、經各廠商報告市商會、爰派執委鄭澤南君至廣東、面見陳伯南、陳述提倡國貨、保護實業、應從整個國家著眼、不能偏持一隅、今粵中倡收國貨入境稅、設各省起而效尤、其害何堪設想、經此請求、陳即面允鄭君、凡屬國人設廠自製貨品、準予免稅入粵、惟外資在滬設廠製造者、則不在此例、鄭君即聲明此後凡有國貨運粵、由上海市商會出具證明書者、憑此免稅、陳已允轉知財政廳、照此辦理矣、鄭君又與本報記者談粵省製糖計劃甚詳、殊有紀載之價值、</p>
<p>自設糖廠、粵省現陳行三年實業計劃、造糖事業、已收歸省營、鄭君在粵參觀省立製糖廠、現時共有四廠、機器由英國及捷克供給、血應付機件價欵、在貨到時、先付二十分之一、餘俟出糖後、分十五期拔清、在開辦之始、原料不免購用爪哇蔗、現經省當局劃定四區種蔗、每一畝田、由省借給農民種蔗本洋二十五元、核計每畝蔗田、自下種至收成、共需成本六十元、今省當局收買甘蔗每畝凈給九十元、因之農民領種蔗田者甚夥、刻下全省已有四十餘萬畝、而省農事試騐塲中蔗種、亦有五十餘類、標優發植、</p>
<p>成績極佳　每畝收蔗一百擔、以之造糖、經實騐所得、可造粗砂糖十二擔、造糖時燃料、即以蔗淬、代替煤斤、故成本較輕、現時每擔粗砂糖、用甘蔗洋七元五角、他費用約一元五角、省徵出境七角、總計每擔成本爲十元、現在滬上粵省廠糖、每擔售十六元五角、餘利之巨可知、據粵省報告、本年僅僅廠糖與土糖統制兩項上、已凈獲盈利五百六十餘萬元、自明年元旦起、預算年可造八十萬擔、現在西南各省、均不用洋糖、人民改食粵廠自造之糖矣、</p>
<p>積極擴充　陳濟棠又向鄭君貢、粵中</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>於製糖事業、已辦有成效、茲已擬定積極擴充大計劃、全省植蔗區、亦推廣至五區、刻下從事種蔗農民、約有四十萬人、明年更將發展製糖廠、決由四所而擴充至十五廠、屆時全年出品、可以增到三百萬擔、核計餘潤、年可得一千六七百萬元、如此埋頭進行、不出五年、外國嚌可以完全打倒、福建當局、亦在提議增設造糖腹、但閉省植蔗區、僅有漳泉廈三屬、無如粵省之巨、</p>
<p>外糖現況　鄭君又謂爪哇製糖廠、最多時、共有一百七十五所、每年可造粗細砂糖二百四十餘萬噸、世界䇷生產力近年均漸恢復、其最大銷行地、製糖廠陸續倒閉、現祗餘四十五廠、政府且限定年出五十萬噸、刻下運銷來華者、尚係一九三二年存貨、爪哇糖每擔成本、須合荷洋四元二角半、今以每擔二元七角半荷洋售華、虧耗極大、再加十三元六角進口稅、即售十九元、亦無餘相可言、鄭君又雷、茍中央能將進口糖稅持久不動、則外糖割除、當不出此五六年也、</p>

<p>— 吳向隅</p>
<p>我們爲誰而寫？這確是值得討論的問題。我們從表面去觀察，這問題似乎是很單純的，不過我們反這問題切開來，從牠的斷面去觀察，我們就覺得這問題並不是如我們所想像的單純，而是一個多方面很複雜的問題。</p>
<p>講到我們爲誰而寫的問題，同時就要聯帶地講到我們寫什麼及我們怎樣寫的問題。換句話說即是一我們的寫作對象是什麼：二我們用怎樣的意識寫作，三我們用怎樣的技七寫作。我們知道我們的社會，已決不是我們三十年前的社會，我們的一部分訊者的口味。雖則我們的讀者是極小一部分，而大部分人尚在我們寫作影響的圈外，而他們的口味，我們也不否認，是仍繼著三十年前人的口味。更明顯地說，在我們寫作影響圈外的有兩種典型的人：第一種是比較居大多數的，他們雖則被帝國主義吸盡膏血，雖則被封建勢力桎梏到了垂斃狀態，而他們的意識仍是前史期的遣物，他們的生活，仍是前史期的雛形。他們當中不能讀的人自然根本不必談，即是少數當中的少數，能夠讀，至多也不過是蠹魚—這蠧魚又只限於銷蝕原來的軟柔的中國紙印的書，至於堅韌的洋紙印的書，即少許銷蝕了些也有些消化。這是一種典型的人。</p>
<p>另一種典型的人，雖則他們也住在都市中，他們的生活部分垢或整個地洋化，或甚至於每日每時與道地的紅毛番接觸，口上講的是漂亮的番文，然而他們讀的書，卻是番人中最劣下的著作，不是迷信的書，即是偵探電影之類小說，這及於他拉的影響，是染上番人的羊腥氣不算外，番人的頑劣的癖見，甚至番人的整個的迷信，也都統統染上。因此他們的見解，是最庸俗的，他們的意識是最頑固的，只知有番，而不知有華，只知有個人，而不知有大衆，這又是一種典型的人。</p>
<p>這兩種生我們寫作影響圈外的典型人，他們的生活方式雖絕對不同，而他們的意識卻有其共同之點的。他們兩者中間對於純文藝的作品，他們認爲是在聖賢經傳之外，不大重視的。最多不過當這些東西爲他們茶館酒後的消遣品。惟其認爲是消遣品，他們的選擇的標準，就形式上講，是愈單純愈好，所以章回小說，從頭至尾講一件事是最合於他們的口胃。就內容上講，是愈膚淺愈好，所以才子佳人的悲歡離合，也是他們最所歡迎的題才。</p>
<p>我們推究這兩種典型人所以如此的，我們可以講這是他們的生活決定了他們的意識。他們生活在另一世界，世界澎湃的思潮，和他們隔絕了。他們雖則生存於二十世紀，他們的意識還是十九世紀的。一部分殖民地形態的見於今日的中國，有其歷史的原因，原不是短時期可以消滅的。</p>
<p>我們見到外貨遍佈中國市塲：我們見到各國的軍艦商輪往來我們內河，我們見到外國士兵的橫行於我國境內，，我們見到外國流氓的販毒殺人在他方面我們見到農民的流離失所，我們見到國民工業的日趨崩潰，我們見到都市的不景氣，我們見到海外華僑的被壓迫歸來，這些相互錯綜的問題及其他許多舉不勝舉的問題，自然是現代作家寫作的對象然而拿這些繁複錯綜的現代中國社會的現象來作寫作的對象，決不是已成化石的意識的人所能勝任，也決不是那在歷史演進上最原始的章回小說所能盡其功能的。處理現代社會的題材，把牠藝術化而活躍於我們面前，自然要適應現代思潮主流的意識做其中心，把這意識中心表現得充分的，自然需要最新的技巧。不過這二者我們決償能從紅樓夢水許儒林外史這些老古董中獲得些靈感，獲得些新的形式的。老狗做不出新把戲，這並不是一句戲話。過去不久曾有些作家，爲求獲得普遍的讀者曾主張相當範圍內不妨採用章回小說。這種向後退的政策，不足以獲得大多數讀者，適足以妨礙中國文學的前進，使牠永無成功偉大作品，置身世界文學之林的希望。我們知道，那些主張採媽章回小說的人，他們認爲新文藝的所以難接近於讀者，是是的形式與內容太歐化，這其實是時代趨向如此，我們在今日的時代，決不能寫施耐庵曹雪芹吳敬梓他們那些純粹的中國土話，反之施耐庵曹雪芹吳敬梓等如果生於今日，他們恐亦將像我們一樣寫現代這樣的語文。所以那些認爲明代小品文中或野叟曝言的語言，要比現代語言有精彩的人，不是有意賣弄野人頭，即是昧於語言進化的原理。偉大文學作品的出現，決不是一蹴而幾的，多數讀者獲得，也不是降格可求的，我們要推動社會整個的文化前進，使文化的水準提高，則讀者自可加多。所以使新的文學作品一般人都能讀，不是文學自身單獨所能達到，也不是在現在狀態之下所能達到的，尚須外力推動。不過獲得多數讀者，實不足焦慮的。中國文學是世界各國文學的一環，世界各國文學所走的路綫，中國自不能例外。那些與時代背道而馳的一切，牠們的壁壘，終將被我們奪取的。我們且等著看。</p>
<h3 id="c180">東京通訊（上） <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>日本文學扎記</p>
<p>在上半年度與去年度終了時，喧歷一時的文藝復興諸問題，自我暑假後重返東京，已匿跡無聞了。甚之作爲文藝復興的本陣之文學界雜誌，近來說不復引人注意，不能插入文壇的主潮之中，回憶過去掣旗轙作頭陣的光榮史，令人感到日本文壇變幻之速。</p>
<p>在最近期中，作爲文壇的論爭的標的，和在提信的東西，那的確可說是轉向問題與主觀復興等了。</p>
<p>轉向問題，不僅僅是局限於左翼作家的轉向，甚之是關聯到純文藝派的轉向。這二派的中心人物，前者可以青年的作者林房雄爲首，後者可以純文藝大統師菊池寛氏爲首。林房雄一派的轉向，不用說是由普羅文學而轉變成轉向派文學（這名辭不是個人杜撰的），而菊池寛氏一派的轉向，則是由純文藝派里轉向成大衆文學（通俗文學）。</p>
<p>關於林房雄的一派里，有武田麟太鄭。片岡鐵兵，村山知義等人，遁些人的創作理論林與武田是同方向的，其他如德永直村山等人，則大都言人人殊，這並不是由於他們轉向的意志不同，而是由於他們對藝術的意見之不一致。</p>
<p>作爲日本左翼作家機關的納爾普，自被奪走了優秀的理論指導家藐原唯人以後，小林相繼夭亡，宮本顯治亦潛入地下，所餘剩之指導部山田清三郎等人，多老朽無能，鹿地亙又被錯誤之政漢主義理論所誤，致使納爾普停止腦腑工作。健全的組織乃成崩毀之狀：於是作家們感理論上指導的缺乏，與過去政治主義的毀作家的創作能力。乃君起責難納爾普，而自已聲言轉變，道派人就是林房堪，德永直武田麟太郎等。</p>
<p>林房雄是個極蘊有英雄色彩的年青人，他是恃有極濃厚的藝術至上主義的氣氛的。在納爾普過動主觀條件強的時候，林氏的確是個能被克服的好細胞，但一等到納爾普衰弱的時候，這使林氏重燃起藝術至上主義的火把，不能再受藏原理論的桎梏似地鎖困了。這火把的重燃，的確相當地震動日本文壇的注目。他的理論是藝術絕對不容許爲政治作功利的工具。至於村山知義他們卻由於生命的自由而轉變，理論上還支持過去的理論，但不拘理論上的分歧如何，在創作上的確構成了一種新的派別，那就是轉向派文學。轉向派文學的題材則與純文藝派無異，主題仍舊採取革命的，不過祗是缺少了積極性，和多加了心理分析，如果太不注意主題積極性的話，轉向派文學可以說是將成爲心理分析文學可以說是將成爲心理分析主義了：如村山知義的白夜是被目爲轉向派的佳作的。同時也充分地曝露了這些弱點，但佳點也有，例如無過重的政治氛圍，與一式的強固了的意識形態。</p>
<h3 id="c181">南洋之街（二） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>被正午的毒辣的太陽董曬著，柏油味陌著風吹到人的鼻孔邊，那怪味刺著人的神經。可是，赤膊跣足的吉寧勞働者舉起丁字鋤，用力地擊碎街上的石子：郤全不覺到似地，從日出到黃昏地工作下去，一些休息的機會也沒有。</p>
<p>（平坦的街道原來是他們修的呵。）</p>
<p>行路人都戴著帽子。在南洋的街頭，你可以看到許多不同的帽子：歐洲的事業家的荷蘭帽，馬來人的紅頂帽，土耳其人的拖著絲帶的帽，……。女人們都喜歡撐一把傘；那些穿了拖鞋的娘惹們的走路姿勢真是有時要使人笑起來的。</p>
<p>大腦袋的印度警察，背著十字架站在十字街口指揮著來往的車輛。他最怕遠遠地有輛牛車載著榴梿或者只是一車的青草；牛是那麼緩慢起走，通過一個街口常常要使汽車，馬車候牠一二十分鐘。</p>
<p>這時候，舖子里是冷清的。</p>
<p>百貨公司只讓播音機把爵士曲子送出來，飄到街頭。坐在人力車上的一個美國少婦會想起紐約的四十二號街，那里不是有最好的爵士音樂班的嗎？</p>
<p>（她猛的有了懷鄉病了。）</p>
<p>銀色的光流浸進過來，天暗了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>關上了門的銀行，汽車公司，書店，百貨商塲……靜悄悄地，里邊只閃著一兩點燈火。看門的印度人也打起呵欠來了，倒在厚玻璃門外的睡榻上，希望市聲趕緊死寂下去，他可以閉起眼皮來。</p>
<p>雜種的賣淫女郎　是有西班牙的爸爸和爪哇媽媽的，可是他們都失蹤了。留下二十一歲的她，每天夜里都得上街來，閃過貪婪的，不懷好意的警察和暗探的眼睛，有的時候在一支街燈柱下站立著：有的時候在一支街燈柱下站立著：有的時候卻蹓跶在行人道上。爲了夜深時的寒冷，她在珈琲店里立坐下來，抽一支象標香煙，唏嘘着。</p>
<p>在南洋之街，最遲把店門關上的是珈琲店了。這里有來自海南島的小夥計；在冷清清地，沒有來客的時候，他會思念起遙遠的家鄉，那里也有椰子和芭蕉的。而且母親是多麼盼望他回去啊，可是……。</p>
<p>失業者在街頭行子著，今夜他沒有家。一聲從生活的邊緣跌了下來的太息，在夜的空氣里加上了一層濃涼。</p>
<p>（到那里安息呢？）</p>
<p>彳于著，一條街又一條街……</p>
<p>夜正長，他不知道還得走多少路，才是天亮的時候。</p>
<h3 id="c182">賣菊花 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<h3 id="c183">斗方（六） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 爲何</p>
<p>我裝聾裝啞地聽著這些話，痛苦地咬著牙齒，一種受侮辱的感覺，深深地刺入我的肺部。彷彿自已是個小猢猻，父親卻是乎里敲鑲口里吶喊的江湖。他不要臉的出賣我的一點小技能，向客人取媚要錢，而我自已卻含垢忍辰的在鑼鼓喧天中扮演一個可笑的腳色。</p>
<p>那些面圖團的紳士，密集集地圖著我在上面寫字的方桌子。我寫得吃力，他們卻呌得起勁。這樣批評，那樣指摘，有的時候卻一齊點著肥豬似的頭，同聲地頓足喝采。</p>
<p>按著紙頭的父親，顯然是給歡喜壓倒了。這是一看他那震顫著的乎，亢奪著的聲調，就可知道的。</p>
<p>撇得要有力，點也不能放鬆一占兒，哎，這樣才對……</p>
<p>他不時同那些人擠著眉眼，滿意的笑著，站在一旁的母親，也茫然的跟著笑。他們愈高興，我卻愈怨恨，愈感到失望，一直地掛著臉孔。開始還好，後來卻覺得乎僵，眼花，腰酸，腳冷，全身像發抖似的痙攣起來。</p>
<p>你看小如咬牙切齒的，連笑也不笑一笑，真有點勁兒！</p>
<p>這帶點兒挑逗的話，簡直使我忍無可忍了。大約是爲了洩憤，我突然決定不照父親指定的聯語寫，卻代以自已想到的一聯。那時我的心跳得非當激烈，似乎全身血管都澎湃著憤恨的怒潮。</p>
<p>「朱門——」</p>
<p>我很快地寫了這兩個字。父親連忙在他指定的聯語以內找，卻沒有一聯開頭是這樣的，這匿然使他著急了。</p>

<p>更就敎育和文化而言、因爲各國人士對於日本都存著惡感九一八二一二八的砲聲霞驚了全世界、各國都講日本爲德意志第二、稱日本侵略的帝國主義或野暨約圖家、而對於日本的文化情形大都不很注意、所以日本爲改變各國對日本的惡感　起見將在這次大會中充分喪現日本文化是如何的高尚廣傳、日本的學校是如何的完善、日本對於世界學術的貢獻是如何的偉大、各國的代表只看到日本的優點、而並沒有看到日本的劣點、於是日本在體們議筯中所留的印象將爲之一變、不㝤惟是、日本更可以用其多年來所搜集的材料、利用口頭文字或電影的方法、以宣傳中國的排日情形、他們可以用卑鄙的手段、拿中國的抗日書籍標語等物來粉飾日本的罪惡、申述日本的強佔東北實在是不得已、這樣一來、可以希國聳動各國代表的觀聽、</p>

<p>第四回　杯水見難求憲工護老萬金談山致猾吏聯摹</p>
<p>窮人看到有錢的人，享受著種種好處，那總是懷著不平的，以爲同樣是人，爲什麼苦的這樣苦，快樂的這樣快樂呢？可是到了和有錢的人一有來往以後，這就很願和他關係密切一點，爲的是想得著他一點幫助。程志前在胡嫂子眼里，那總是個頭等闊人。因爲他天天到小西天去，總看到他和坐汽車的朋友來往，那就是一個明證。因爲西安城里，並沒有私人置的汽車。就是商家的汽車，也是那大卡車和長途客車。在街上來來往往的轎式汽車，也不過一二十輛，那都是各衙門里的。所以在胡嫂子眼里，所有在街上跑轎汽車的人，那都是老爺。他這種猜想，卻也不能說是不對。又因爲志前是和這些人常在一處的，自然他也是個準老爺了。現在把志前引到家來，這就很想和他發生一點密切的關係，把月英買給他作姨太太。不料他第一句答覆的話，卻說這不是辦法。胡嫂子在小西天後院，也曾在暗地里注意到，志前向且英偷偷的已經看過好幾眼，似乎他也很愛惜這位小姑娘的，現在他都引到家里來了，難道還有什麼變卦嗎？於是就靠在了那黃土牆勾起他一雙小腳，抓起他髪髻上那個銅耳挖子，不住的向頭髪里搔著。一面笑問著道：老爺，我們窮人，連主意也是少的，你說還有別的什麼法子嗎？（五三）</p>

<p>王壬秋對於情的問題曾有有趣的主張，他說兩情相愛，不在年紀。唐玄之於楊妮，庶幾非好少者；武氏之控鶴，亦庶幾自忘其年者。所以他八十之年，還鍾情於周媽。他又說；李長吉云，天若有情天亦老，彼不知情老不相干也。情自是血氣中生發，無血氣自無情，盡情何處見性。宋人意以爲性著情惡，彼不知善惡皆是情，道亦是情，血氣乃是性，食色是牆，故魚見西施而深潛，嬙施見魚而欲綱釣，各用其情也。情窺不許，與痔疥七子，皆與情無關，正是事理當然，文人戲言，又是論乎？武氏控鶴，與登徒差似，但控鶴非其配耳，此則武氏之不幸，彼直任性不用情也。說來說去，乃知荀子性惡，賢於孟子性善，孟只說得習。此論頗興現代之變受神聖論相合。宋儒只在性和心兩件東西上用功夫，費筆墨，卻未嘗想著一個情。孔老夫子說食色性也，壬秋偏說是情，是壬秋要借此自圓其說。然而未免有一點牽強。不過現在的人，總是把性情兩字併爲一譚，那麼性者情也，情者性也，一而二，二而一，宋儒說的性，也可以推到情字上去，這們一湊，壬秋的話，就沒有批駁處了。</p>
<p>像錢牧齋和柳如是的因緣，當然也可以把壬秋的情論來做辦證的，所以柳如是說，妾髪郎顏，妾顏郎髪。至於壬秋說：武氏控鶴，與登徒差似，是任性不用情。似乎自相矛盾，上面已經說他自忘其年，當然是從情字上生發出的。宋玉窺牆，固然是單相思。但是潘伯寅在故都，曾經把窺臣者三年矣射唐時：總是玉關情，那麼單相思是片面的情，不算情，卻算什麼？</p>
<p>壬秋是漢學家，所以對於宋儒是反對的，結論又引出一個性善性惡的論戰來，但是他在楊玉環武則天的身上發揮出一番情論來，別的學者萬萬沒有這種勇氣和風趣的。</p>

<p>前人的衣服，著到幾上午，現在服裝，一年幾瑍，甚至一季數變。所以現在人的嫁娶，也要一生數娶，也要一生數娶，一年幾嫁！</p>
<p>衣服舊了，可以更新；不知人的怎樣變易，到了老來，又怎樣的處置呢？我著實要替他們擔一個大大的心事！</p>

<p>— 夫凡</p>
<p>日前，予詣旅舍飭徐州友人劉君，見其有詩云：虎山盡是寶，風雨迷徐州，予詢之。劉君曰：故鄉城之南有山曰虎山，風景幽美，內藏奇寶。有楊映權著，爲清乾隆聞人，雅好書盡，名聞江北，官絳州爲知府，爲官十年，所得盡購古物；未幾目覩清廷污穢，乃告老歸隱，將數十年所搜羅之墨貴刻石，砌成圍壁，上蔽廊字，以禦風雨：並設立詩社，更迭唱和，一時虎山成爲江浙文人薈藪。其砌壁古蹟計有彭城八景，蘇東坡所書前後赤壁賦，米南宮書盡，宋岳盡所書前後出師表，及朱元章，董其昌，朱熹，鄧文原，唐寅，黃庭堅，王獻之所書之題讚序詞賦等共一百餘種，爲希世之寶。清某貪官，偵知楊藏此奇珍，曾派人來說，須將此等古物歸之大內，楊以巨金賄來人，謂古物乃假者，始得免。嗣紅羊亂起，徐州首當其衝，烽火遍地，各古貴碑石，淹沒於蔓草荒煙中，風雨損蝕，殊爲可惜云。劉君語次，並從皮箱中取出碑帖百餘種見示，但覺琳瑯滿目，古色古香，秀逸雄壯，無不俱備，真千古奇觀也！</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其實，我們也很明白，禁令總是只在表面上遵守的；暗地里正不知道有幾千百雙眼睛，躲在適當的所在，大膽著，不惜身試法的在張望咧！</p>
<p>最後，我們便到了皇宮的面前：整列的隊伍，就在官門外紥住了。到得這里，不免又要從規定的種種儀式以內，挑一種出來表演表演了。第一，必須不讓太后獨自冷冰冰地踅進去：困爲在清宮中，有一個很頑固的習慣，—其實宮里所有的習慣，簡直是無一不頑固。—每當皇上或太后臨幸一處比較不常到的地方之前，必先有人在里而排班跪接，才算尊嚴。現在就是這情形。於是那一位總管太監李蓮英，便大大的忙亂起來了：凡逢到要表演什麼儀式的時節，總不能不請他來當導演，此刻自然又少不掉他。他先向那十六名給太后抬鸞興的小太監儆了一個眼色，他們就知道了，立即停止前進，端端正正地站在御道的中央，使太后的臉，恰好貼對著那三屬宮門中間的最大的一扇大門。</p>
<p>這十六名太監，便像十六尊石像似的肩著太后的鸞與，一動不動地站立著：因爲這一座鸞興是絕對不能讓它站著泥土的，否則尋常人家的官轎，當主人端坐在里面等候什麼事情的時候，轎夫侭可暫時缷下他們肩膀上的擔負來，讓這轎子停在路上，主人一般也很舒很，而他們卻就省力多了。然而這種福氣，卻不是給太后抬鸞輿的十六名小太監所敢妄想的：他們這時候不但不能把鸞輿歇下肩來，休息休息，而且連大氣也不敢喘咧！（一六三）</p>
<h3 id="c217">呌的種種 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>這里所謂呌的種種，就是稱呼的種種。稱呼，在咱們中國是五花八門，不一而足的。現在就區區所知道的，不妨寫點出來看看。</p>
<p>例如：祖父，有的地方呌爹爹；又有的地方呌爺爺；更有的地方呌公公。</p>
<p>例如：祖母，有的地方呌娘姆；又有的地方呌娘娘；更有的地方呌奶奶。</p>
<p>例如：父親，有的地方呌爺；或呌爺爺：又有的地方呌爹：或爹爹：更有的地方呌伯；或呌阿伯；還有的地方呌爸爸；或呌伯爺</p>
<p>例如；母親，有的地方呌姆媽；又有的地方呌媽媽；更有的地方呌娘；還有的地方呌阿媽。</p>
<p>好了好了，光是這一點，呌的種種，我想已夠讀者諸君頭昏了吧？要是把省省各縣，各色各樣的方言土語，一一寫出來，（其實有許多土話非筆所能寫），本刋固然沒有這偌大的篇幅來容結，就是讀者諸君，也要爲之編得頭腦子疼哪！唉！總而言之，咱們中國方言之複雜，只要看到這上面所列的呌的種種，便可以想見一班了！那又何怪有種人要利用英語來代替那各省各縣各色各樣的方言土語來通話呢？唉！這樣看來，統一語言，提倡國語真是不可或緩的事情！</p>

<h3 id="c218">文旦與栗 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>（一）文旦</p>
<p>秋果之最碩大者，厥維文旦，樹爲常緣灌木，產於間廣，幹高丈餘，枝有剌，葉爲長圓形，葉柄有真狀小片，實徑四五寸，形圓，色正廣，皮極厚，不易脫剝。種類甚多，斷白味甘者古稱香藥。或云：皮里淡紅者曰香欒，皮里白而慈淡紅者，謂之朱欒。文旦以漳州者爲最著，漳州府志云：杮最佳者曰文旦，出長泰縣，色白味清香，風韻宜人，惟溪東種者爲上，其地所種無多，移他處則不佳。又廣西容縣之沙田柚，尤名聞全國。江浙稱柏之味酸者曰泡，閩中則凡柚皆稱泡，亦作拋。暹羅所產者，形較小而皮色徵黝，如不足取，然汁冬而甘芳，最爲上品。古人所云：皮相失天下士，於此益信。</p>
<p>枝花開於春末，蕊圓白如大珠，既坼，則似茶花，氣極清，與茉莉素弊相逼，番人采以蒸香，風味超勝。見范成大桂海處衡志。</p>
<p>擇文且以頂高紋細者爲上，扁圓紋組者必酸。若剝皮完好者曝乾之，其形似椀，可以貯物，昔時老人之吸旱煙者，尤爲必備之品。蘭中有子，以水浸之，異常黏賦，婦女以塗雪變，功用不普曇花。</p>
<p>文旦有一趣話。猶憶某歲予爲某刋物撰一元旦應時稿，被乎民誤排元旦爲文旦，翌日編輯者吳君雙熱致予一札云：投我以元旦，報之以文旦，非報也，乎民打棚也。套葩經語，爲之嗢噱。</p>
<p>王西神前輩嘗作香欒小譜有云：香遠益清，明窗靜對，如藝都梁，如晤古騒人騎士，味則瓊漿淺挹，不爲醒醐之灌，自有醇醪之醉，神州蔬果，侭多名產，顧欲求一蘊蓄宏深者，不得不推此君爲碩果。即海舶遠來，琪花瑤草，鮮果時珍，往往以癡肥厚重見長，亦未見有能與此驂斬者。推崇如此，文旦固當之無愧者也。</p>
<p>（二）栗</p>
<p>栗於果中，本爲上選，陸瓊稱之爲椇榛並列，茭芡同行者也。屬落棄喬木，幹高四五丈，葉如簡鋘，初夏開花，花落收之，燃以火雖風雨不滅。實有殻斗甚大，剌如蝟毛，霜降後熟，外有硬彀紫黑色，一苞內或單或雙或三四，仁淡紅色，可食。又有每苞一實而形小者，爲栗之原種，謂之栵。其實曰芧栗，訛作茅栗。俗稱橡果。</p>
<p>桂花栗產於西子湖濱之滿菊弄，嚼之自有金栗芳馥之意，蓋其地多桂，花氣薰蒸然也。梁谿鄉間亦有是物，香味不遜滿菊弄所產，但名不甚彰耳。</p>
<p>種栗之法，於冬末春初時，子埋濕土中，栽向陽地，待生長若千尺，方可移種。春分時則取櫟樹或本樹之茂碩者接之，性畏寒，初冬以草包之，二月方解。</p>
<p>栗有極碩大者，後漢書馬韓傳：馬韓出大栗如梨。陸游對食戲詠：霜栗大如拳。詩義疏：桂陽有栗叢生，大如柿子。鄭中記：鄭中產巨栗，說其殻，可以爲杯。至於神異經云：東方荒中有木名目栗，其殻徑三尺三寸，殻刺長丈餘，實徑三尺，則荒誕不近情理，未可爲信也</p>
<p>古人詠栗頗多名句，如庚信云：秋林栗更肥。方回云：盡黃新栗嫩。杜甫云：山家蒸栗暖。肥也，嫩也，暖也，盡栗之長，非老饕不知。</p>
<p>栗宜飴糧和沙炒之，則較甜可口。近更有利用機械，不假人力，攙入蜜糖炒之者，尤爲名品之雋。</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>據說這次是趁著澳洲的百年紀念，英國就此舉行了這麼一個歷史上最偉大的航空競賽：浩浩蕩蕩，有二十架飛機，幾十位飛將軍，從化敦直到澳洲東南的墨蕭鉢恩市，路程計長一萬一千三百餘哩。爲冠軍英國的青年飛行家史高脫和白拉克二人，以三日也不到的時間—計只七十一小時十八分—完成了這樣河山重隔著的遙遙長程。像這樣有史以來，世界交通史上的偉大驚人的壯舉，真是值得人類歌頌，贊揚，而大書行書的了。</p>
<p>不過，關於這一次的航空競賽的動機與用意，當然，該不會就這麼簡單的。誰也不得否認了吧？這位大英帝國主義的在遠東的政治經濟基礎，自從日本帝國主義在九一八拼了一拼，而野心勃發以來，早就得到很大的威脅，甚至有些兒動搖的了。何況，在今日，世界正處於，多事之秋的亂動中，以至興牠—英國，有著切身關係的海軍比率談判沒有結果，而在各各相持之下。那末，像這位屬地多於本地的帝國主義，正得要盡用著種種方法，以加強牠這漫佈在世界各地的大不列顛帝國的組織。因此，這次英澳間航空競賽的發動，怎不能說是牠早要有的企圖興用心呢？</p>
<p>此外，更有當今中美航空事發的節節發展，而至各帝國列強間，對於發展遠東航空事業的競爭等，也都足以推動這次競賽的發動。</p>
<p>然而，這次轟動世界的國際航，空競賽才完畢，而第二次的競賽傳聞又來了。據今日報載二十六日哈瓦斯電，法國航空部長特蘭將軍，也正擬組織自巴黎到越南河內之國際航空競賽，路程有一萬八千公里，與英澳距離，相下無幾。消息傳來，正得使人驚嘆世人對於航空熱之了甚了。然而，這怎麼能例外呢？用意，也不過是準備加進法帝國主義與遠東各殖民地的關係吧了！</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>晨起讀報，得離婚新聞一則，大意如次：</p>
<p>律師某興某氏結婚後，彼此感情忽感不洽，時興勃谿，遂釀成男方向法庭提起離婚之訴。但出庭受審的前晚，夫婦倆猶同居于xx公庽，歡洽互談。迨翌日出庭時，彼此復顧相而笑，雙方代表律師亦均謂不應上庭廠煩。庭審結果，官諭出外和解同居，當事倆又相顧而笑退庭同去云云。</p>
<p>此一事實之演出，真有些莫名其妙！新聞記者笑得腸子打結，說是打破離婚的紀錄，作者看到這一則新聞，簡直也笑得批皮絞痛，既富風趣，又饒意義，所以特地提出來談一談。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>民國肇造以還，由包辦婚姻一變而成自由婚姻，這本是蠻好的現象。雖然有些冬烘者羣還在掀著鬍鬚歡氣，但大體說來，稍有新智識的一般善男信女，總算是皆大歡善，奉行不怠，在法律上，在社會習慣上，都已確定了它的位置。</p>
<p>不過也許是因爲太突變了，就生出矯枉過正的毛病來。近二十年來婚姻上的轇䊪，確要比以往幾千年累積的總數還要多，這卻不是瞎說，而是千確萬真的事實。今日向居，卿卿我我，明日離異，視若路人，是常有的事。來得便當，去也容易，這本是自然的趁勢。因轇戟一多，就被人家對婚姻自由的本身發生欵義，以爲與其信樣轇戟，還不如包辦的好。</p>
<p>其實，這是絕對的誤解。我們應該知道，現代中國婚姻之所以多轇轕，並不是婚姻自由的本身的錯誤，而是運用的不得當。現在一般人對於婚姻簡直視同兒戲，完全沒有誠實的意思，本來想軋軋姘頭搭搭朋友就算了事，並不對於對方作純正的觀察，一味只以財色爲依歸，婚後又不盡夫婦上的義務，體貼，溫存。這樣，當然是結合易，離異快，轇轕無窮了。</p>
<p>雖然像蘇聯國內的婚姻，結合與離異，是極平常的事，沒有什麼稀奇。可是我們究竟學不上那種樣兒，爲的是我們的社會還相隔一個世紀，他們個個有職業，男女已臻真正的平等，婦人也一樣的有經濟領域，能在社會上單騎活動，那當然結合也好，離異也好，都是嘸啥關係。反觀我國，婦人仍如往昔般的不能獨立，全靠色相維持生命，婚姻成了兒戲，吃虧者就是婦人一方。</p>
<p>某律師與某氏離婚的趣聞，就是婚姻的兒戲的最好榜樣。我希望在這遇度時代里，大家應對此認異些，這也是扶動歸運發展的一個動力呵。</p>

<p>— 木風</p>
<p>從畫報上看見了一幅題爲呼籲無門的災民圖：那是一千多個嘉興的老幼婦孺的災民，爲饑餓所迫而羣集縣政府乞賬，縣政府卻把鐵門緊閉，災民無法入內，乃枵腹坐待於門外的情形，</p>
<p>據說今年的災情之慘，更甚於民國二十年的七省大水災，現在北方各省是洪水汜濫，廬舍爲墟：南方各省則赤地千里，禾稼盡枯：在這樣水旱災所受的損失，總數在十萬萬元以上，災區面積，則佔全國的總面積三分之二。</p>
<p>在這社會的自然法則發展底下，農村經濟之日趨破產，已成爲一種必然的要，更何況於今是再加上一層重重的災害呢？因此，我們每天從報上總可以看見各地乞賬的函電，知道在災區里的老百姓是怎樣地匍匐在死綫上和餓寒苦鬥！</p>
<p>雖然各省旱災義賬會已爲這受災害的萬萬生靈想出了辦法。議決一面向各界募捐，一面請中央通令實施以工代賬，並減免被災各地田賦附稅。然而，這些都非蒸救災民於袵席之上的根本辦法。何況又是遠水救不得近火呢？記得有人在嘆地說：當科學昌明之現在，竟毫無能力抵搞自然界之侵害，人事之未盡可知！欲謀救濟，治標之外，更應致力於治本，否則災後施救，僅係例行事務，較頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳，尤爲短視也。這話才是道理。</p>
<p>寫至這里，那幅聚集著千餘個老幼婦孺的災民，枵腹坐待於縣政府的鐵門外，飽嘗閉門羮的災民國，又在我的眼睛映現一羣匍匐在死綫上而呼籲無門的災民，是何等牠悽慘呵！</p>

<p>前幾時跳舞被人作爲救國的工具的，可見跳舞本身並不是要不得的玩意兒；而在大學生跳舞發生的影像並不佳妙，所以禁止大學生跳舞，毫無疑義的。這責任要大學生自已來負，我們母庸多嘴。</p>

<h3 id="c239">家的分析 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 王壬</p>
<p>從來家字的意義，是指人生長居住的地方：集合了曾祖父母，兄弟子侄，以及妯娌姊妹，妻兒子女，所以成家。再說得清楚一些，就是一門之內，謂之一家。這就是所謂的家庭。</p>
<p>再有，照字興上說：婦請夫爲家。所以孟子云：女子生而願爲之有家。同時家字與姑字可作同解：因之，稱女子都可稱家。而有所謂大家者，又是尊稱女子的意思：如漢朝的班昭，稱爲曹大家，即是這個原因。</p>
<p>若將家字廣義點推演起來，則家雖在昔時，也並不怎樣狹窄的。但無論如何，家字的用處雖大，卻不如今日的濫觴。他們（即昔時的人們）凡是應用一個家字，總不會超越一門之內的這個定義，所以橫說直說，用去用來，家字畢竟還是用在家上，決不會用到家外的。</p>
<p>謂予不信，請舉幾個例罷；</p>
<p>家人：猶言一家之人。</p>
<p>家山：就是現在人所稱的故鄉。</p>
<p>家父，家母，家兄，家姊……就是對自已尊長自謙之辭了。</p>
<p>家廟：即鄉下人所指的祠堂。</p>
<p>家事：即一家之事也。</p>
<p>家計：即生活也。</p>
<p>家法：用以管束子弟，不勞國家衙門費神。</p>
<p>家賊：指那些不良的實貨，專做些引狠入室的勾當。</p>
<p>他如家書，家訓，家學，家聲……舉不勝舉。總之在昔時所以爲家都不外在一個門框子里，好像前朝的婦女，未曾高唱解放時，輕易不許出閨門一步一樣。</p>
<p>然而，今也不然。婦女已經解放（？）了，且與男子同樣平等自由了。自然，區區一個文字的應用，隨著時代的變化，又何嘗不可廣而泛之？於是，家字在現社會的定義，乃迎運而大紅特紅，廣至不可再廣，泛至不可再泛。自所謂政治家，法律家，敎育家，文學家，藝術家，……凡有一技之長，無不是家。於是剃頭是家，揑腳是家，泥水木匠亦家，販夫走卒亦家。等而下之，黃包車夫可以成家，義夫又何獨不可稱家？甚至流䛉，拆白，乞丐，盜賊之流，也都可以稱家。於是洋洋乎盈耳哉，家之義大矣！社會上無一非家，世界上乃都是家。</p>
<p>然而，這樣一來，家字最初的定義，到現在就完全反了。前之以一家字爲一門之內的稱謂，現在竟脫出門限，普及社會，普及全人類。這其中的變化，我怕算說孔老夫子，翻開字典要莫明其妙，就找倉頡回來，也要瞠目莫答哩！</p>
<p>或曰：此一時，彼一時。從前那種狹的定義，不合於當世。所謂一門之內的思想，更應打倒！家既能生出腿來，走遍東南西北，走遍社會，走遍世界，普及人人，正是好事，君不合信口雌黃。我說：唯唯。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sends Xiao Zhenying to Mongolia to Meet Wang Chonghui, Liu Zhi, and Others <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Physical Examination Shows All Parts in Good Health</p>
<p>Beiping - Chairman Chiang, due to a telegram from the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee inviting him to Mongolia for guidance, but unable to go due to a physical examination, summoned Xiao Zhenying at Xiehe Hospital yesterday afternoon, ordering him to go on his behalf. Xiao said that Chiang was extremely concerned about Mongolian affairs and, due to the physical examination, was unable to accept the Mongolian people's welcome to go. He specially ordered him to represent him on this trip. The length of stay in Bailing Temple is yet to be determined, but he expects to return to Beiping in about ten days to report back to Chiang. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Zhao Daiwen visited Chairman Chiang at Xiehe Hospital yesterday afternoon to report on the recent military and political situation in Shanxi Province and to seek instructions on everything. Zhao went to the Western Hills for rest this morning with his secretary, Tian Xiangkui, and is staying at the Western Hills Hotel. Since Chiang's arrival in Beiping, personnel from various embassies have been vying to pay their respects, but Chiang, due to his physical examination, has been unable to receive them. Madam Huang is scheduled to hold a tea party at the Political Readjustment Committee on the 2nd to welcome Madam Chiang, inviting the wives of various military and political figures to accompany her. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - The results of Chairman Chiang's physical examination at Xiehe Hospital in recent days show that all parts examined are very healthy and will be completed soon. On the morning of the 30th, he separately met with Wang Chonghui and He Jingwu at the hospital, and in the afternoon met with Liu Zhi, inquiring about the recent military and political situation. Wang and others briefly talked and then took their leave. It is reported that Chiang, due to a previous telegram from the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee welcoming him to attend and provide guidance, but unable to go due to the physical examination, decided to send Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Military Affairs Committee, to Mongolia to convey everything on his behalf. Furthermore, Mongolian princes and dukes residing in Beiping have also been preparing to welcome Chiang since his arrival in Beiping. Chiang has instructed the municipal government to compile a list of names for a scheduled meeting. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Shang Zhen is scheduled to host a banquet for Liu Zhi and his wife tomorrow evening, inviting Song Zheyuan, Huang Jie, and others to accompany them. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Chen Yanjiong arrived in Beiping this morning to await an audience with Chiang. This afternoon, he went to Jurentang to visit Yang Yongtai and talked for a long time. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Qian Zongze said, "I came to Beiping last night. I will visit Chiang in the next few days. Chiang paid great attention to the situation in the Northwest during his recent inspection. I came to Beiping to provide Chiang with consultations on the situation in the Northwest so that I can report to him. The date of the audience with Chiang has not yet been determined. After the audience with Chiang, I will return to Zhengzhou. The Longhai Railway is scheduled to open to traffic to Lintong on the 1st of next month and to Xi'an by the end of this year. The plan is to extend it to Lanzhou in the future. Because the land along the Longhai Railway stations is barren and sparsely populated, the entire railway's business is insufficient to cover expenses, with monthly income only five or six hundred thousand. The central government is paying attention to the development of the Northwest, which has major significance for the revitalization of the national economy and politics." (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Yu Xuezhong went to Xiehe Hospital last night to visit Chiang, reporting on his trip to the south and the recent military and political situation in Hebei Province. After finishing, he left Beiping by car this morning to return to Tianjin to handle provincial affairs. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Chiang and his wife are undergoing physical examinations at Xiehe Hospital these days, and the whole process is almost complete. They are expected to be discharged from the hospital in about two or three days. This morning, Wang Chonghui and He Jingwu went to Xiehe Hospital to pay their respects and report on everything. Liu Zhi and Yu Xuezhong are scheduled to pay their respects at 5:00 PM today to report on provincial affairs. Madam Huang visited Song Meiling at Xiehe Hospital this morning to return her visit. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Liu Zhi and his secretary, Lai Zhiyan, said that Liu came here on Chiang's telegram and is scheduled to visit Chiang this afternoon. He will stay in Beiping for a maximum of one week and then head to Bian. The banditry in Henan Province has been mostly eliminated, with only a small part fleeing into Anhui Province. The Henan Red Spear Society has been eliminated, and the local area is trending towards stability. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Zhang Boling went to Beiping on the morning of the 30th to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan - A certain relevant source received a telegram from Sui, stating that Fu Zuoyi is scheduled to go to Beiping to visit Chiang on the 32nd. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan - Official sources recently received a telegram from Zhao Daiwen from Beiping, stating that he has met with Chiang. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing - Yang Yongtai telegraphed He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, and Zhang Zhizhong from Beiping on the 28th, reporting on Chairman Chiang's physical examination at Xiehe Hospital. The original telegram stated, "Chairman Chiang arrived in Beiping on the 24th and went to Xiehe Hospital on the afternoon of the 26th to undergo a general examination. All parts are healthy. He moved into the hospital that evening for a more detailed examination. Yesterday, the lung and stomach examinations were completed. The lungs are very strong, and the stomach's outer shape is not enlarged or sagging, and there are no abnormalities inside. Chairman Chiang is extremely pleased, and his spirits have been greatly boosted. He is expected to be discharged from the hospital around the end of the month. Please inform all comrades." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Wang Chonghui Meets Beiping Press <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Beiping - Wang Chonghui met with the press at the Beijing Hotel at 5:00 PM on the 30th. His responses to the reporters' questions were as follows: 1. My trip to the Southwest is purely in a private capacity, to convey messages to all parties. 2. I have visited Chairman Chiang twice. Chiang is very clear about the opinions of all comrades. 3. The rumors that I plan to hold a position in the central government are not true. Although various parties hope that I will hold a position in the country, I have only requested a six-month leave for this return, and traveling back and forth between the north and south has no political nature. I have now met with all my friends and am preparing to go abroad at the end of the year. 4. It is difficult to answer the question about the future trend of diplomacy in North China because diplomacy is a holistic matter. 5. The issue of the sale of the railway by Japan and Russia is not expected to cause problems at present. 6. The monopoly of kerosene by the puppet organization fundamentally violates the Washington Treaty, as the principles of the treaty are equal opportunity and the open door. China, not just the Northeast, cannot allow any one country to dominate or act alone. Regarding the spirit of the treaty, the United States issued a joint note to China and Japan this January for clarification. Therefore, this move by the puppet organization is a violation of the treaty's principles. 7. I will stay in Beiping for another day or two and then go to Shanghai first. I expect to go to The Hague at the end of the year. 8. My impression of Beiping is that the market is slightly more sluggish than before the capital moved south. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Wang Chonghui said, "After I arrived in Beiping, I had two talks with Chairman Chiang. Chiang was unable to talk for a long time due to his physical examination. I am scheduled to visit him again tomorrow. I will leave Beiping and head south in two or three days. It is undecided whether I will go to Hong Kong again. I plan to go to Shanghai first for this trip to the south. If I do not go to Hong Kong and Guangdong, I will make arrangements and return to The Hague at the end of the year. The relations between Japan and Russia are expected to be temporarily peaceful recently due to the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The petroleum monopoly of the puppet Manchukuo violates the two major principles of the Washington Treaty: 1. Equal opportunity, 2. Open door, so it definitely cannot become a reality." (30th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Hebei Administrative Conference Holds Joint Review Meeting <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Delivers Instructions</p>
<p>Tianjin - The Hebei Administrative Conference held its third joint review meeting at 9:00 AM this morning. The original proposal by the Department of Industry to have the counties handle the measurement and standardization inspection offices after their abolishment was passed. The meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. County heads and experts spoke extensively on the method of compensating for the abolishment of miscellaneous taxes, all feeling that although the miscellaneous taxes were abolished, the county's compensation tax was less than one-tenth, and local administration would inevitably come to a standstill. In the end, it was decided that the implementation method would be decided at the recent provincial administrative meeting. The conference was originally scheduled to close at 5:00 PM this afternoon, but because there were still many proposals that had not been reviewed, meetings must continue to be convened on the morning and afternoon of the 31st. If time permits, the meeting may be adjourned in the afternoon. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin from Beiping by car at 2:00 PM this afternoon. At 3:00 PM, he went to the conference hall of the Engineering Institute to deliver simple instructions to the commissioners and county heads attending the conference. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin - Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin from Beiping at noon on the 30th and attended the fourth general meeting of the Administrative Conference at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Due to Yu's fatigue from the journey, Wei Jian continued to act as chairman of the meeting. After the opening ceremony, Yu gave a speech, briefly stating, "Today, there are two points I want to say to all the county heads. First, Chairman Chiang instructed me to tell everyone that local officials in charge must do practical work and should not be perfunctory or opportunistic. Second, what I want to say to everyone is that the purpose of this conference is to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, eliminate the gap between the top and bottom, and communicate opinions. I hope that all county heads will break through their personal prejudices and be responsible for the implementation after the proposals are passed." After Yu finished speaking, he listened for half an hour before returning to the provincial government to handle important matters. After Chiang is discharged from the hospital, he will go to Beiping to pay his respects again. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">England, Japan, and America at the Naval Preparatory Conference <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>After the Naval Preparatory Conference opened in London, the three major naval powers, England, America, and Japan, held individual talks first to seek understanding of their political, diplomatic, and military opinions as preparation for next year's naval disarmament conference. The major powers, mindful of the disputes at the previous Geneva Disarmament Conference, feared repeating the mistakes and jeopardizing the future of peace, hence they all adopted a cautious attitude. Initial consultations between England and America in June of this year were met with setbacks and postponed for three months. Whether England and America have been able to come close to agreeing on naval armaments today remains a question. Although there is a trend for England and Japan to reach a relatively satisfactory compromise politically, there are still points that are difficult to reconcile in military technology. For example, Japan has proposed the abolition of all offensive naval vessel types, including aircraft carriers. Indeed, Japan is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and in terms of location theory, it is difficult for any strong enemy to invade. However, since the gradual development of the air force, the flight from England to Melbourne, a journey of more than 11,200 miles, only takes 71 hours, including refueling and stopovers. Under such circumstances, if there is further progress, Japan will completely lose its natural barrier. Once an international war breaks out, aerial bombing will be Japan's greatest concern. Therefore, when proposing disarmament, attention is paid to thoroughly reducing this type of weapon. However, Britain, in order to maintain its maritime hegemony, control its scattered colonies, and protect its vast overseas market, would certainly not be willing to give up this superior weapon. The threat of submarines was something England experienced during the last war. With advances in current tactics, the effectiveness of submarines will inevitably expand. Britain has the largest number of merchant ships in the world and can modify them into armored cruisers in wartime, but they are ultimately insufficient to counter the stealth attacks of large submarines. Therefore, Britain strongly advocates for the abolition of submarines. Japan, on the other hand, claims that submarines are defensive weapons and not necessarily for offensive purposes, hence they firmly advocate for their retention. If such technical disputes cannot be resolved, they will inevitably affect the entire compromise and trap England and Japan in a stalemate.</p>
<p>As for the armament relationship and political position between America and Japan, there is absolutely no room for reconciliation. Due to the competition for the Far East market, Japan considers itself to have special privileges as the geographical overlord, while America insists on the open door policy and does not allow the Japanese to monopolize. Both sides want to implement their own proposals and have to expand their military force. When America can maintain its previous naval superiority, with the so-called five, five, three ratio existing - it still inevitably suffers blows in the Western Pacific and feels the hardship of insufficient military power. Fortunately, there are still the Washington and London treaties to maintain the status quo. Although its battleships are insufficient to attack others, they are still more than enough for self-defense. Although American ships are gradually becoming old and not as new as those of Japan, America is blessed with abundant natural resources, and the reserves of material and human resources are still being tapped. Heavy industry is also being promoted. Today, with rapid processing and preparation, it will not be difficult to catch up in the Pacific. Moreover, its aviation is progressing rapidly. If peace cannot be maintained, offense and defense can still be handled freely and will never be without a solution.</p>
<p>Therefore, if military parity - the naval armament parity of England, America, and Japan - is commonly acknowledged by the disarmament conference, and battleships are reduced and aircraft carriers are abandoned, it seems that American military power will retreat and be on par with France and Italy. But would America be willing to give up the Far East and be relegated to the same level as South America? We anticipate that even if the conference faces a stalemate, America will not hesitate to ignore the success or failure of the disarmament treaty and will firmly adhere to its existing proposal. In other words, it will not agree to conditions such as reducing battleships, increasing cruisers, abandoning aircraft carriers, and maintaining submarines. However, this proposal is directly contrary to what England and Japan have proposed. Therefore, it is impossible to seek a sincere compromise and realize the spirit of mutual concession today. Then, can the future of the preparatory meeting be predicted?</p>

<p>London - Yesterday afternoon, British and American representatives held their first formal naval discussion at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. Both sides compared their impressions of the Japanese proposal. Before the British-American meeting, Japanese and American representatives had a conversation lasting an hour and a half. The Japanese representative elaborated on the Japanese government's naval policy, particularly emphasizing the principle of naval equality. He also answered questions from the American representatives regarding the comparative use of cruisers, aircraft carriers, and submarines. The British-American talks followed the Japanese-American meeting, making them particularly noteworthy. The British-American talks also lasted an hour and a half. The British side was represented by Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, and naval officer Chatfield. The American side was represented by Davis, Admiral Standley, and Minister to Switzerland Wilson. Both sides had experts assisting. The discussions focused on the Japanese proposal for naval tonnage equality and limitations on battleships and aircraft carriers. It is understood that the British and American sides expressed differing views on this issue, with different needs. Their opinions on the size of capital ships were particularly divergent. However, they agreed on several points regarding submarines. Both Britain and America hope that the Washington Naval Treaty can continue to be effective. Both sides felt that it would be extremely difficult to reconcile the desire for universal equality in total tonnage with the various national defense needs. It is expected that all parties will make prolonged efforts to reach an agreement. British and American representatives agreed that Japan needed every opportunity to clarify its position, but also believed that the Japanese government's difficulties should not be increased. Discussions among all parties will continue. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Equality May Not Guarantee Security</p>
<p>Japanese Demands Could Incite Competition</p>
<p>London - Although representatives from Japan and the United States continue to engage in ostensibly friendly negotiations, their opinions are completely opposed. Furthermore, American representatives have frankly expressed their opposition to Japanese opinions to the British. After only one week, the naval conference has already hit a major snag. During the Anglo-American meeting on the 29th, a powerful American representative thoroughly refuted the Japanese disarmament proposal. The main points were: equal naval strength does not necessarily guarantee an equal sense of security. The Washington Treaty provides equal security for signatory nations. Britain and the United States do not wish to change the current average state of naval strength and security levels. Furthermore, changes to the Washington Treaty would naturally affect the Nine-Power and Four-Power Treaties. If the disarmament principle advocated by Japan is recognized, smaller countries would also gain the right to build warships, which would inevitably lead to naval competition. Adopting a total tonnage system would lead to even more intense competition in the research and manufacture of pocket battleships. There is currently little hope of concluding a new naval treaty after 1936. If a new treaty is not established, Japan may not be able to achieve naval equality with Britain and the United States. From this perspective, the preliminary negotiations face many difficulties. (Domei News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>London - During the Japanese-American talks on the 29th, American representative Davis raised various questions, and Japanese representatives Matsudaira and Yamamoto responded. The American side maintained a realistic attitude, advocating for the maintenance of the current treaty and a 20% reduction in naval strength for all countries, while preserving the current state of Class A cruisers. Admiral Standley and other naval representatives, backed by President Roosevelt and Secretary Swanson, adopted a very firm attitude, showing little inclination to accept the Japanese proposal. There is pessimism about the future of the talks. (Domei News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>London - After the preliminary talks between British and American representatives today, a communiqué was issued, stating only that the naval talks had been temporarily suspended some days ago but had resumed this afternoon. The British representatives were Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, Chief of Naval Staff Chatfield, and Treasury Secretary Sir Fischer. The American representatives were Norman Davis, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Standley, U.S. Minister to Switzerland Wilson, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in London Atherton, and Naval Colonel Huseman. However, the communiqué made no mention of the issues discussed. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Recent Japanese Demands <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>If All Nations Recognize Equal Rights</p>
<p>Actual Equality Need Not Be Implemented Immediately</p>
<p>London - American Chief Representative Davis is ill, so there was no Japanese-American meeting today. Davis is suffering from overwork. He hopes to be able to get out of bed tomorrow, so the American delegation will go to the Japanese Embassy tomorrow to listen to the Japanese representatives' explanation of offensive and defensive weapons. It is heard that if Japan obtains recognition of its naval equality rights from all nations, it will make a unilateral allowance, not expanding its navy to a level equal to that of other nations. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - As the disarmament conference proceeds, the United States is gradually revealing its intention to pursue military operations in the Far East and opposing the Japanese disarmament policy. The Japanese authorities have the following views regarding the American attitude: Japan's proposal aims to determine the spirit of disarmament and establish a principle of non-aggression against other countries, which no country should oppose. If the United States opposes this proposal, it must be seen as insisting on military operations in the Far East. The Japanese people regard the Washington Treaty as an obsolete relic of the past and firmly believe that abolishing this treaty can eliminate international instability and lead to good results. All countries in the world should have equal rights. A treaty that stipulates that Country A can take offensive actions against Country B while Country B cannot prepare its defenses is extremely unfair. Since the Washington Conference, the Far East has repeatedly experienced turmoil. Who can say that this is not due to the influence of the treaty? Only after abolishing the Washington Treaty can the Nine-Power and Four-Power Treaties be carefully implemented. Therefore, these two treaties also need to be changed. Japan's arguments are related to the navies of the signatory countries of the Washington and London Treaties and do not address the naval strength of other smaller countries. According to the American representatives, if Japan's claims are realized, it will trigger naval competition among smaller countries. However, there has never been competition in shipbuilding among smaller countries, and there may not be any in the future. The United States opposes the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons. However, the distinction between large and small offensive capabilities is naturally clear. Those who deliberately oppose this are no more than those who insist on the doctrine of attacking the Far East. The future of the naval conference does not allow for optimism, but there is no need for pessimism either. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>American Plan Completed</p>
<p>Preparing to Cope with Japan</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. Navy has completed its plan to establish four strong naval bases in the Pacific, in preparation for Japan's abrogation of the Washington and London Naval Treaties and the failure of the London talks to establish a naval agreement satisfactory to the United States. According to the Associated Press today, the four bases are as follows: 1. Dutch Harbor in Alaska; 2. Pearl Harbor in Hawaii; 3. Corregidor in the Philippines; 4. Samoa Islands. The Dutch Harbor naval base will primarily consist of an oil station and a naval air station. The oil station is for use by large U.S. ships. Dutch Harbor is located in the Aleutian Islands, extending 1,500 miles from the U.S. mainland into the Pacific and 850 miles from the Japanese coast. The U.S. fleet will conduct annual maneuvers near the Aleutian Islands next year, which is unprecedented. The Navy Department plans to build large-scale defense works in Dutch Harbor. The current Samoa Islands are as undefended as Guam. The defense equipment of the entire island consists of nothing but machine guns. However, if Japan abandons the Washington and London Treaties, defense works will be added to Samoa Island. Corregidor, at the mouth of Manila Bay in the Philippines, will become another Gibraltar. Although the U.S. military base in the Philippines will be abandoned due to the independence plan, President Roosevelt and Congress have made special provisions that detailed measures will be completed in accordance with the principles satisfactory to the Philippines and the United States. Thus, the Philippine base can still be maintained. As for the Hawaiian Islands, they will become a second Heligoland. The United States is currently prohibited from establishing new bases in the Pacific due to the provisions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. However, naval officers stated that if Japan builds new bases, the United States will implement this defense plan. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that next year's naval maneuvers will be held in the northeastern Pacific. This statement indicates that the United States is shifting its focus of military attention to Alaska and the arc-shaped route across the Pacific. Approximately 104 warships will participate in the maneuvers, which will take place in the vicinity of Alaska, Puget Sound, and Hawaii. If an incident occurs in the Pacific, the area is suitably located at the intersection of North American and Asian transportation. Diplomatic circles are paying close attention to this new situation but do not consider it to have any special political significance. The reasons are as follows: 1. Naval activity in this area has been threatened by aircraft and submarines in recent months. 2. U.S. naval exercises are already widely known. Since the Great War, exercises have been held in all other U.S. territories adjacent to the United States and important ocean areas near the United States, except for the Philippines and some small islands. The U.S. fleet has conducted exercises as far as the South Pacific and Australia and held special maneuvers in the Panama Canal. Tactical exercises have also been conducted in the Caribbean region. Foreign naval observers therefore generally believe that this exercise in the northeastern Pacific is merely a continuation of previous exercises. However, this Pacific exercise has considerable diplomatic implications because it is likely to affect the issue of Pacific defense after the abolition of the international naval treaty.

<p>Tokyo - The Ministry of Finance held a meeting yesterday to review the budgets of the Army and Navy Ministries. The approved military budget is as follows:</p>
<p>(Navy Ministry) Basic budget of 400 million yen; 90 million yen approved out of the 300 million yen in new budget requests.</p>
<p>(Army Ministry) Basic budget of 300 million yen; 150 million yen approved out of the 246 million yen in new budget requests. Among them, aviation maintenance costs and Manchurian Incident expenses have been approved, while other non-defense expenses have been completely reduced. The Ministry of Finance approved a total of 940 million yen in defense spending, which is an increase of 4 million yen compared to last year's defense spending. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Ministry of Finance is determined to maintain financial stability, even at the expense of the cabinet. Therefore, it has drastically cut the new requests in the draft budget for next year submitted by the Army and Navy Ministries. The Army Ministry requested 246 million yen, and the Navy Ministry requested 300 million yen, while the Ministry of Finance only approved 150 million yen for the Army and 90 million yen for the Navy. In other words, the Ministry of Finance only approved 44% of the Army and Navy's new requests. In addition to the Army's regular budget of 310 million yen and the Navy's regular budget of 400 million yen, the Minister of Finance has also decided to levy a temporary excess profits tax to cover the budget deficit. Prime Minister Okada inquired with former Finance Minister Takahashi yesterday about his opinion on this new tax, and it is reported that Takahashi has agreed. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Paris - It was learned today that the French government, unwilling to lag behind in the European arms race, will request an increase in army spending of 800 million francs. Minister of War Pétain met with Finance Minister Mallen until late last night to discuss this issue, and discussions continued this morning. The Finance Committee of the National Assembly also had a lengthy meeting. After the meeting, the Finance Minister declared that he strongly supported allocating 800 million francs for the needs of the French army beyond regular expenses. The Finance Committee of the National Assembly has not made a definite statement regarding this request. (National News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting to discuss national defense expenditures. Minister of War Pétain attended and explained that the one-year conscription system should be strictly implemented this year to make up for the shortage of recruits. The Minister of War also said that even after supplementing the military quota in this way, the national defense force is still insufficient. Efforts must be made simultaneously in terms of armaments and military supplies. The government will request additional funding from the National Assembly outside of the budget. The government is responsible for this matter. This request will be submitted to the Finance Committee for discussion. Minister Pétain's declaration was important in content, concise in language, and resolute in intent. The 78-year-old General gave a speech lasting an hour, explaining the reasons for requesting additional funding without repeating a single word. He considered issues concerning quotas and armaments one by one. His focus was purely on budgetary matters. He believed that there would be difficulties in the international situation after the Saar plebiscite next year. He also took this opportunity to explain that the weapons and methods used by the German army are increasingly offensive in nature. He concluded that France should defend itself carefully and should not be negligent. National defense measures should be strengthened at all times. Pétain's speech was met with much applause. The general rapporteur of the committee, Jacques, said that the estimated expenditure on armaments was too low. To make the budget more practical, this expenditure must be increased by at least 310,000,000 francs, so that the expenditure on armaments in recent years can be paid off by 1935. (Havas, 29th)</p>

Under the slogans of restoring Caesar's glory and reviving Sparta, all men between the ages of eight and thirty-three must receive training in the use of firearms. In the thirteenth year of Fascist Italy, in addition to intensifying military preparations, the corporate system is being implemented on a well-prepared basis.

<p>Changchun - The government of Manchukuo officially announced its petroleum policy on the 30th. However, the petroleum necessary for domestic consumption still needs to be supplied by foreign countries as before. As for the government's monopoly, it should try to adopt the current sales organization and respect the interests of existing businesses to establish a system that can be operated perfectly. In addition to listing the above circumstances, it also emphasizes the main points of implementing the Petroleum Control Law. Finally, regarding imports and exports, they cannot be carried out without permission. Although the government itself is the point of sale, it will treat all nationalities equally. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Dalian - News was received here in Dalian today from Changchun that the Manchukuo government's attitude towards its petroleum policy is as follows: The protest documents from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands cannot be accepted before the formal recognition of Manchukuo. Although the open-door policy is included in the Manchukuo's declaration of independence, it has not been included in any international treaty since the establishment of the new state. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to news from Changchun, Manchukuo will divide the kerosene sales area into ten regions, each with a central sales office. It is estimated that there will be several licensed retail outlets per region. It is heard that the interests of current kerosene importers will be respected, and if they apply to the authorities, they will be granted an import quota. Current manufacturers will also be allowed to continue operating if they apply to the authorities. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - The Times of London criticized the Manchukuo kerosene monopoly today, stating that the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands have no differences of opinion. The rumor that the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are colluding against the United States is completely untrue. The newspaper also said that the Japanese government seems to think that after spending some money, they can unilaterally set kerosene prices and limit the annual trade volume of each oil company. The companies are capable of stopping their overseas oil supply to retaliate against such high-handed behavior, but they hope that the Japanese government will realize the appropriateness of treating the companies more equitably.

A squadron of U.S. Army fighters, which had received Kingsford Smith's radio message, welcomed them in the air. Kingsford Smith flew around the city for a week before landing. Factories and ships all sounded their horns. The airfield was crowded with people, and local officials also came to the field to welcome them. Cabinet member Dole gave a speech on behalf of Finance Minister Morgenthau, calling Kingsford Smith the first person to fly to Honolulu from a foreign country. Kingsford Smith said that the journey was very difficult. The most dangerous thing was that he encountered a rainstorm last night about a thousand miles from Honolulu. Kingsford Smith wanted to turn on the sea exploration lights but accidentally switched the mechanism to reduce speed. The plane suddenly spun and fell from 14,000 feet to 6,000 feet before he could regain control of the plane. However, he was momentarily terrified. It is now known that Kingsford Smith will fly to Los Angeles when the weather is suitable. However, judging from today's weather, it may not be possible to do so for two or three days.

<p>Washington - Dr. Eckener, the commander of the German Zeppelin airship, suggested that the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands jointly use German airships to operate scheduled aviation services, taking the route from Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, through southern Europe, to Friedrichshafen, Germany, and then flying from there across the Atlantic to New York. However, for flight safety reasons, it is planned to use helium to fill the balloons. Although the United States produces a lot of helium, its export is prohibited by the government. Dr. Eckener arrived in the United States some days ago to discuss this matter. According to him, all kinds of weather difficulties can be overcome by using airships. (Havas, 29th)</p>

At that time, the Manchukuo side's views on the Soviet response document can be expressed and discussed on the spot.

<p>Hu Guangfa, Commissioner of the Labor-Management Liaison Office, Murdered</p>
<p>Tianjin - The strike wave at the Majiagou Mine had subsided by 7 pm on the 29th. The workers resumed work after the contractor accepted their demands: 1. Replace the supervisor Zhao Jing; 2. Absolutely no subcontracting. However, when the workers sent 20 representatives to see Hu Guangfa, Commissioner of the Labor-Management Liaison Office, Hu's reply was not satisfactory to the workers, and his demeanor was inappropriate. The workers believed that they paid 450 yuan per month to support the liaison office, which had commissioners, secretaries, clerks, and other positions. Its nature was as an intermediary between labor and management after the suspension of various mine unions. Hu Guangfa should not have ignored the suffering of the workers. Therefore, after the labor unrest was resolved, a worker named Wang Lianqing ambushed Hu on his way home with a sharp axe, attacking him unexpectedly with thirteen blows. He was seriously injured, and although he was injected with a cardiac stimulant at the hospital, it was ineffective, and he died at night. After committing the crime, Wang turned himself in to the authorities. The workers all sympathized with Wang's actions and stated that if the official handling of the matter violated public opinion, they would still go on strike. Although the labor unrest at the Ma Mine subsided on the 29th, the situation remained serious due to the murder of Hu Guangfa. The security team was on guard inside and outside the mining area, but the workers did not take any significant action. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin - At 2 pm on the 29th, 2,000 workers from the three shifts in the Majiagou Mine of Kailuan went on strike because the contractor Zhao Lan violated the labor-management agreement between the workers and the mine bureau by subcontracting to small contractors, which exploited the workers' rights. The workers negotiated with Zhao without result. The supervisor Zhao Jing usually abused the workers, and the workers resented him most. Therefore, they took the opportunity to strike and gathered in the factory, refusing to disperse. When the strike wave occurred, the mine district police station immediately sent the security team attached to Jin Qiupu to the mining area to maintain order and persuade the mine workers to resume work. The workers sent four representatives to negotiate with the contractor and elected 20 people to negotiate with the labor-management liaison office established by the mine bureau.

Recently, the Jiaxing Commercial Bank in Zhejiang Province has collapsed again. The bank's creditor group formed a united association and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, accusing the bank of illegal fraud and requesting that the Zhejiang Provincial Government be ordered to supervise all directors, seal up their properties, and prohibit all directors from disposing of their privately operated shops and properties. They also requested that personnel be dispatched to liquidate the assets in accordance with the law. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Finance immediately ordered the Currency Department to formulate a handling plan for review and approval. An economist said that a bank is a joint-stock company with limited liability under the law, which is slightly different from the unlimited liability of a money shop partnership. It is very difficult to deal with the personal property of the directors. In short, it is not advisable to deal with banks that have not joined the banking group and have insufficient capital, no matter how favorable the interest rate. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e82">A Historical Account of the Xinjiang Incident (Part 1) <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Kashgar Correspondence.</p>
<p>The situation of the recent incident in Xinjiang has been reported in newspapers from time to time, but unfortunately, the information is limited and unsystematic, which may not attract the attention of readers. I have just arrived in Kashgar (i.e., Shufu) and happened to witness this disaster. Now, I will provide a brief report of what I have heard and seen, as well as the various sufferings I have personally experienced, to readers far away in the interior.</p>
<p>The causes of this rebellion in Xinjiang are complex. Initially, Jin Shuren's misgovernment (the details of which cannot be described in detail due to time constraints) led to a popular anti-government trend. However, there was no tendency towards any violent uprising because although the ethnic groups in Xinjiang have always harbored hatred towards the Han people, they lack the ability to act independently (their character is mostly foolish). Without outside forces taking the initiative, they would have no possibility of acting independently. Now, the ambitious bandit leader from Gansu, Ma Zhongying, whose ambitions have not died (he originally intended to seize Xinjiang to establish his special Muslim power, which is well known and cannot be concealed), intends to stage a comeback. He learned from his failure to incite rebellion in Hami last year, so in addition to notifying the encircling Hui people who were resisting in that area in advance, he also colluded with Provincial Army and Chen Ma Fuming (a Muslim from Hezhou) as internal allies. (The regiment happened to be stationed in the Shanshan and Turpan area.) Also, because he had just been recruited by the central government, it was inconvenient for him to openly enter Xinjiang with a large force. Therefore, he only sent a plainclothes team of 37 people to Xinjiang first to engage in agitation and incitement. Once the chaos spread and the Provincial Army was unable to defend against it, they could use the excuse of popular opinion to ask him to come out of the mountains to quell the rebellion. He could then seize Xinjiang without making a sound, while still maintaining the pretense of not breaking away from the central government, controlling the ambitions of Britain and Russia. The cunning of his plan is evident here. Who knew that his ignorant plainclothes team would gradually reveal their intentions to others, intentionally or unintentionally, when they saw that everything was going smoothly? However, after the 37 people left the mountains, they knew that there was a large force blocking their path in Hami, making it difficult to pass through. Therefore, they took a detour through the mountains to Shanshan (the city is near the mountains) and reached their destination. Due to Ma Fuming's internal support, Shanshan and Turpan soon fell one after another. The bandits now occupied two cities, had a regiment of soldiers, and a large number of supporting Hui people. Their momentum grew daily. At this time, the Provincial Army was far away in Hami and was being held back by the bandits who were resisting. They had to transfer troops nearby to suppress the rebellion, but ultimately failed to recover the cities due to the large number of Hui people. The bandits then divided their forces into two routes, one attacking the provincial capital and the other taking the Southern Route (i.e., the South Xinjiang Road). The bandits who took the Southern Route relied on the power of the local Hui people to attack, causing the counties along the route to fall one after another. They then advanced to Yanqi and established a general headquarters there, calling themselves the Yanqi Bandit Suppression Command of the 36th Division. At this time, the transportation between Kashgar and Dihua was cut off. All subsequent documents and telegrams had to be routed through Yili, around the Bing Daban Pass, and to Aksu before being relayed to Kashgar. Every message took more than twenty days. The local Hui people in various places in southern Xinjiang were also ready to move, many secretly preparing weapons. For example, the case of investigating iron bars in Moyu County and the case of confiscating large-headed clubs in Yingjisha County (made of strong wood, over three feet long, thick at one end, and filled with iron nails at the thick end). Although the authorities discovered this, they dared not pursue the matter for fear of provoking a popular uprising. The Hui people saw through this weakness and became even more unscrupulous. Later, almost every person had a large-headed club or iron bar and roamed the countryside. At this time, we Han people feared being attacked by them and did not dare to travel even a step away. Even if we had to go to the countryside for business, we had to go in groups and carry weapons, but we were still very cautious and did not dare to stay for long. The authorities' fear of provoking a popular uprising and their tolerance of everything was a cautious approach, but this kind of popular uprising had already shown signs of erupting, even without provocation. Unfortunately, the authorities were unaware and indulged in complacency, leading to the current chaotic situation. What else can be said? At this time, Ma Shiming, who was entrenched in Yanqi, took advantage of this opportunity to send his followers to the areas of Luntai, Kuqa, and Baicheng to actively incite and spread propaganda (claiming to be acting on the central government's orders to overthrow Jin and save the people). The general ignorant Hui people echoed his calls. Kuqa was originally a place that had been rebellious for a long time (it had rebelled twice in 1918 and 1923). The Hui people of the county, Temier (who was a porter head in Kuqa County, known as a "carriage household township chief" in Xinjiang), gathered Hui people and secretly organized. As a result, Luntai, Kuqa, Toksu, Shaya, Korla, Baicheng, and other counties rebelled one after another. All Han women were raped and occupied, and all Han people who resided there, whether travelers or permanent residents, were brutally killed. Luntai was particularly tragic compared to other places. It is said that most of the Han people who died were beaten to death with clubs, because at that time, the weapons they used, apart from the few firearms seized from the government army, were mostly large-headed wooden clubs. In addition, all Han people's property, whether the owner was present or not, was looted. At this time, the rebels' slogan was to build Islam (meaning Islam), advocating killing Han people and reviving the Hui people. As a result, the Hui people in southern Xinjiang were incited. At this time, the rebels were approaching Aksu. Jin Shuzhi, the commander of the Kashgar Garrison (Jin Shuren's fourth younger brother, who had no political or military knowledge, was extravagant, and specialized in extorting money), was panicked when he heard the news and immediately sent Regiment Commander Yang Qingming with two companies of cavalry to defend. (They departed on January 30th.) Commander Jin was still afraid that his forces were insufficient and discussed with Tao Yin Ma Shaowu (a Yunnan Hui Muslim) several times to appoint Li Denglong, the adjutant-general of the division, as the commander of the second route to assist Aksu. Just as they were preparing to depart, they received news of a rebellion by the Hui people in Leyu County (in southern Xinjiang, forty miles from Hetian). All Han people, from the county magistrate downwards, were beaten to death with large-headed clubs. Hotan, Lop, and Keriya counties also rose up in succession. Pishan, Yecheng, Zepu, Yarkand, and Shache counties also sent urgent reports one after another. Commander Jin saw that the general situation was over and was heartbroken. The next night, he announced that he had suddenly died of an illness. After Jin Shuzhi's death, military power was transferred to Ma Shaowu. At this time, Aksu had already fallen. Regiment Commander Yang retreated to Bachu. Kashgar's Hui and Han cities (Shufu, where the Tao Yin was located, and Shule, where the commander was located) were in extreme danger. Tao Yin Ma was originally the leader of the New Sect of Islam, and he thought that he could pacify the people's hearts through his religious connections. Therefore, he sent people to Hotan and the surrounding areas to offer comfort and ordered the second route to assist the Aksu army to depart. When they arrived at Jiutai (a station name, two stations below Bachu), they encountered the rebels. The two armies were in a stalemate for nearly two months. During that time, the Kashgar army won several battles, killing nearly a thousand enemies, but due to the disparity in numbers and the disorganization of the army, they ultimately failed. Commander Li died in battle. At this time, Commander Ma received a telegram from the Provincial Government appointing him as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Southern Xinjiang. He then appointed Si Xingyang (from Gansu), Li's staff officer, as the commander. He was inexperienced and young and was not from the military. As a result, the army was dissatisfied, and internal conflicts arose from time to time. Ma continued to send Liu Ding (from Gansu), the chief of staff and regiment commander of the division, as the commander of the third route to assist Aksu. However, Liu had previously instigated discord between Commander Jin Shuzhi and Ma Shaowu, and he was mediocre and timid. On the front line, he had disagreements with Commander Si, leading to constant disputes. As a result, the military situation on the front line became increasingly chaotic. At this time, Commander Ma saw the situation on the front line and knew that it was difficult to win. In addition, the consolations in Hotan and other places were ineffective, so he changed his plan to make peace and sent representatives to welcome the rebels to Kashgar. Both sides then stopped military action. Ma took advantage of this ceasefire to send a telegram to the front, ordering Liu to secretly send a team to Hetian to quell the rebellion. However, Liu refused, saying that the rebels had not retreated. Ma could do nothing. At that time, several of Ma's trusted officers offered advice to Ma, urging him to recruit Burut people (a nomadic people who live deep in the mountains, also known as Black Tartars, referred to as Bu people for short) for assistance to alleviate the temporary emergency. However, some people said that these people were originally ruthless bandits who did not know human nature and could not be relied upon to help the Han people defend the territory. After considering it, Ma Shaowu finally adopted this strategy. In less than half a month, he recruited seven or eight hundred people, formed them into a regiment, and gave them four hundred rifles and two cannons. At the same time, he recruited two battalions of Hui soldiers and one company of special forces (a mixture of Han and Hui), and after the organization was completed, he appointed Company Commander Chen (a Shandong Hui Muslim) as the regiment commander to lead a regiment of Bu soldiers to Suhongka (a small road leading to Dashi) to prevent the rebels from attacking Kashgar by detouring through the Dashi small road. He also sent two additional battalions of the new army to Pishan to block the path of the bandits from Hotan, Changyu, and other places to Kashgar. The cause of the Hotan uprising was that Yan, the magistrate of Leyu County, was greedy and insatiable. Also, because he served two terms (since Jin Shuren took office in Xinjiang, it was stipulated that the term of office for each county magistrate would be limited to one year. Yan and Jin were both from Gansu, so Yan was given two terms). Moreover, the staff used in the office were generally local ruffians, who colluded with each other, leading to a popular uprising. Therefore, the rebel leader Yimir (from Moyu County, about thirty years old, was a Hui scholar, now called "Pasha Pasha," which means Hui King) gathered a crowd to riot and attacked the county office, killing Yan's entire family. He then broke through Hotan. It is said that not many Han people were killed in Hetian, but their property was confiscated, and they were reduced to beggars.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Director Yu's Speech at the Baojia Conference of Counties South of the Yangtze River <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Continued</p>
<p>The Baojia compilation and investigation procedure consists of three phases. Currently, ten counties have completed the third phase of work: Tongshan, Fengxian, Xiaoxian, Jingjiang, Qidong, Yancheng, Gaoyou, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai, and Shiying. Five counties are about to complete the third phase of work: Rugao, Nantong, Suqian, and Chongming. Six counties are currently in the third phase of work: Peixian, Ganxian, Pixian, Suining, and Haimen, Huaiyin. Three counties have just begun the third phase of work: Siyang, Changshan, and Huaian. Three counties are currently in the second phase of work: Donghai, Guanyun, and Muyang. As for the content of the work in each county, some counties have progressed quickly and the work is practical and correct, some counties have progressed slowly but the work is correct and practical, some counties have progressed quickly but the work is incorrect and impractical, and a few counties have even made mistakes of perfunctory and hypocrisy. What we hope for first is correctness and practicality, and second is speed. We believe that it is acceptable and productive to delay the time slightly for the sake of correctness and practicality. For example, Peixian is a good example. The most unacceptable thing is to be perfunctory and sloppy. Even if the three phases of such work are completed, we will definitely punish them to redo it. These counties with achievements will be announced after all the work is completed in the future. In short, in the Baojia work of the counties north of the Yangtze River this time, several counties in the Tongshan area have done very well, and several counties in the Donghai area have also done well. Jingjiang in the Nantong area has also done well. The counties that have done well have now shown great results. The Xuhai area has always been a region with many bandits. Every time the crops are growing, bandits rise up like hair. This summer, the counties were able to pass through peacefully, and several counties cannot but attribute it to Baojia. The most obvious fact is that, first, bad people have no one to guarantee them and cannot stand in society; second, in kidnapping cases, the hostages cannot find a hiding place. There are also several counties that can actively use Baojia to carry out the work of prohibiting smoking and foot binding, such as Xiaoxian and Suining. In Xiaoxian, it has also achieved great results. The people of Xiaoxian are grateful for the benefits of Baojia. Many two surnames who have long had deep feuds and have not interacted in the countryside are now happy to guarantee each other. The people of Xiaoxian are now even automatically asking the county magistrate to extend the time for training the Baojia chiefs. Generally speaking, the Baojia work of the counties this time is flawed but practical and hardworking, so the results of the compilation and investigation in each county are generally correct. As for the general shortcomings, the first is the lack of preparatory work before the event. The first lack is the work of publicity. The illiterate people are naturally ignorant. If they do not pay attention to the meaning of the Baojia system, they will not understand its usefulness. Therefore, it causes many people's doubts, misunderstandings, and even disputes, which delays the progress of the work. If there is widespread publicity and forceful publicity in advance, these troubles will naturally be reduced or even not occur. The second lack is the work of training. The members of the compilation and investigation committee, the district chiefs, and even the personnel in the county government who are handling the Baojia work are all personnel who are actually engaged in the Baojia work. They should have sufficient training in advance. They should thoroughly understand all the laws and regulations of Baojia. They should be prepared to answer all the practical problems and difficulties. However, most of the counties did not do this work sufficiently, so these workers often make mistakes in their actual work, which affects the efficiency of the work. The third is the lack of communication. The Baojia is to organize the people of the whole county, which is closely related to the interests of all the good people in the county. We should invite all the powerful groups and powerful elements in the county to participate and work together, such as the Party Headquarters, schools, mass organizations, and all other legitimate organizations. We should contact them and invite them. In this way, the work can proceed smoothly. There are many counties that understand this principle and do so, but most counties have not paid attention to this and are only working hard on their own. No wonder everyone is doing weak and hoarse work.</p>
<p>Everyone, now holding Baojia has gotten a lot of cheapness, and the experience of counties north of the Yangtze River in doing Baojia has become our teaching and our borrowing. I would now like to bring up a few things from the actual experience aspect for your attention: First, pay attention to the preparatory work before the event. The so-called preparatory work is the publicity work, training work, and communication work just mentioned, as well as other material preparations, that is, the preparation of all utensils. Everything is established if prepared in advance. Do not dig a well when you are thirsty. Do not be busy and sloppy. Second, carefully select the members of the compilation and investigation committee. If the members of the compilation and investigation committee are not selected well, the work of compilation and investigation cannot be done well. Those who have no sense of responsibility are not allowed. Those who cannot endure hardship are not allowed. Those who specialize in mixing up the errand are not allowed. Third, follow the working procedures set by the department. The department sets three phases of work, and each phase has a special nature. There is a certain procedure in fact. If you are curious and do not follow this procedure, or if you try to be clever and advance together, you will inevitably mess up the steps and inevitably get incorrect results. Reorganizing it will inevitably waste a lot of time and money. This is already a lesson of fact. Fourth, carefully select the Baojia chief. The purpose of Baojia is to unite good people and eliminate bad people. If you are not careful in selecting the Baojia chief and choose bad people instead, it is better not to do Baojia. If it is found in the future that bad people have become Baojia chiefs, we must quickly move one of your places with command and do a compilation and investigation test area. In this area, all the compilation and investigation personnel will be gathered to do a thorough test and practice, and then gradually give it to other areas. This method has been effective, and you are worth emulating. Sixth, actually get the joint guarantee and the core of the joint result. It must be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Do not be perfunctory and careless.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that you will first be practical in your work and never have a perfunctory heart. We want to sweep away all the perfunctory and hypocritical faults of the past counties in handling population, investigation, and handling letters, etc. Otherwise, we will end up with the result of wasting money and hurting people, and we will be the sinners of Baojia. Second, we must be quick in our work. Perfunctory is certainly not allowed, and delay is not allowed. We must take the lead, do it in one go, and quickly organize the Baojia in each county to complete our purpose of self-government and self-defense as soon as possible. However, it is certainly not allowed to intentionally delay and hinder the progress of the work, but it is also not allowed to intentionally be clever and hinder the practicality of the work. Third, I hope that you will always go to the countryside and, in accordance with the provisions of the schedule, visit each district in person during the first phase and convene the people to talk about the significance of holding Baojia. During the second phase, visit each district in person and give lectures to the Baojia chiefs of each district and township on the significance and methods of compilation and investigation. During the third phase, visit each district in person and conduct spot checks on households in accordance with the table.</p>

<p>Gu Surname in Tinglin Wutu Robbed</p>
<p>The home of Gu Jinxiang, a farmer in Dayang Wutu, Tinglin, Punan, was broken into by five robbers with a guest accent at about 12 o'clock on the night of the 26th. Each robber held a rifle, and iron bell, etc. and broke in from the side door of the house. One robber tied Gu's feet and threatened him with the muzzle of a gun against his chest. The remaining robbers searched the room, robbing one gong, two pieces of cloth, three silver earrings, and forty-five yuan in cash. After the robbery, they fled back the same way. The victim had foot injuries. A wooden-handled iron bell and a pistol bullet left by the robbers have not yet been reported. After the Director of the First Branch Bureau Li Zeshi found out, he went to inspect the scene and reported it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>The County Public Security Bureau recently appointed Yang Shijie as an inspector and Yao Xigui as an inspector. The appointment orders were issued yesterday and distributed to each of them to take office. According to Yang Shijie, he previously served as an inspector and the captain of the Detective Team during the tenure of the former Director Shen, and he solved major cases one after another. Especially when the Pudong bandit Taibao Ashu was wreaking havoc in the counties of Songjiang, Jinshan, and Fengxian, he accompanied the army to search for the remaining bandits and made great efforts to clear the area as soon as possible. Now that Director He has appointed him as an inspector, he will surely be able to help in the future arrests.</p>

<p>Creditors of the Xingye Bank File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Suzhou branch of the Shanghai China Yuye Bank closed down last month due to the influence of the Shanghai head office. The branch was managed by Wu Songlu and Qin Xinmin. Since the bank's closure, they have been avoiding meeting with anyone. The creditors have organized a creditors' group at the Central Hotel to pursue compensation. Because the managers ignored the creditors' group, a representative meeting was held the day before yesterday (the 29th) in the evening to discuss methods of pursuing debt recovery. It was resolved that all creditors would jointly file a lawsuit with the Wuxian District Court against Wu Songlu and Qin Xinmin, demanding that they be ordered to compensate the full amount.</p>

<p>The major stores on Guanjian Street in Suzhou City, etc., have strongly opposed the national goods mobile exhibition organized by Sun Zicheng and others, claiming it promotes national goods but is actually for personal gain. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that on the afternoon of the 29th, representatives from the silk industry, foreign and domestic goods industry, foreign and domestic cloth industry, thread industry, and hat industry associations, including Tu Haoquan and Wu Jiyuan, took a petition with signatures from over a hundred stores to the county chamber of commerce. The purpose of the petition was to request that since the chamber advocates for national goods, it should change the mobile exhibition to an exhibition hall and not engage in retail or wholesale sales to protect the business of stores in various industries during the winter season. The chamber of commerce was holding a temporary meeting that day and immediately brought the matter up for discussion, deciding to send a letter to the national goods mobile exhibition, requesting that it be changed to an exhibition hall. It is also reported that the stores have been sending letters to national goods manufacturers in Shanghai, asking them not to participate to avoid damaging relations.</p>

<p>Dispute Over the Education Bureau's Distribution of Funds</p>
<p>The principals of the county's elementary schools recently discovered that the Education Bureau Director, Lu Jingmo, had reported to the education authorities that the expenses for the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of this year had been fully disbursed. However, each school only received 50% of the funds for August and September. Feeling confused and alarmed, they jointly inquired with the bureau. Director Lu stated that the schools had no right to inquire, and they did not receive a satisfactory explanation. The principals then petitioned the county government. The county magistrate, in addition to reviewing the bureau's submitted documents, promised the schools a detailed investigation. This occurred on the 25th of this month. Now, on the 29th, the bureau disbursed 50% of the September funds. The principals seized this opportunity to express their dissatisfaction and again asked the director for clarification. At the same time, the County Education Association, believing that Director Lu's report to superiors was inaccurate and that a significant amount of funds was missing (approximately 10,000 yuan), sent representatives to the bureau to audit the accounts. Upon hearing this news, the director, fearing a scandal, went into hiding and could not be found. According to bureau personnel, he claimed to have requested leave to go to the provincial capital, but no leave request had been received during the day.</p>

<p>Oil Mills Oppose Grain Tax in Anhui Province</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government recently stipulated that a grain tax of five liters per stone would be levied on grain leaving the province, including soybeans. The oil mills in this county rely on soybeans imported from Anhui as their raw material. This year, Anhui suffered from severe drought, drastically reducing soybean production. Moreover, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces also experienced drought, leading to sluggish sales of soybean cakes and making it difficult for the mills to sustain themselves. Now, Anhui Province suddenly imposed a grain tax of 5%, directly increasing the burden on the oil mill industry and indirectly harming rural areas. Therefore, they specially sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce yesterday, requesting that they telegraph the National Government, the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, urging them to order the Anhui Provincial Government to amend its regulations and exclude soybeans to alleviate business difficulties and benefit farmers. Furthermore, the tobacco, hardware, and electrical materials industries in this county stated that business has been declining in recent years, with sales less than half of what they used to be, yet the business tax rate has not been reduced. Therefore, they specially proposed at a meeting of the county chamber of commerce members that a telegram be sent to the ministries and provinces yesterday, requesting a general 50% reduction in the business tax rate to alleviate their hardships.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Provincial Order to Postpone Land Value Tax Collection <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The land value declaration for the city of Wuxi, which was originally scheduled to be completed in two months after the door-to-door declaration began, from September 1st to the end of October, has been delayed due to continuous telegrams to the central and provincial governments from local public organizations and urban residents, expressing their difficulties and requesting postponement, as well as petitions to Beijing and the provincial capital. Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate of Wuxi, recognizing that Wuxi has suffered from consecutive years of disasters, business decline, and rural bankruptcy, coupled with this year's drought, which has severely impacted the urban economy, believed that if the land tax were levied immediately after the land value declaration, the people would be unable to bear it. However, the land value declaration is an important task for implementing the Prime Minister's legacy and reorganizing land values, and it should be completed on schedule. He immediately submitted a report to the provincial government, requesting instructions. Yesterday, he received an order from the provincial government stating: "The purpose of the provincial government's organization of the city land value declaration in your county is to reorganize land administration, which is a very important task. You must complete it on schedule and not delay it in any way. As for the request to temporarily postpone the collection of land value tax, it should be approved." Magistrate Yan, upon receiving the order, immediately issued a notice to all businesses in the city, granting a one-month extension until the end of November. They must complete the declaration form within the deadline and not hesitate any longer. Yesterday afternoon, he also summoned the township heads of the city's thirty-five townships to the county government to talk, instructing them to provide practical assistance to facilitate progress.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Requests Abolition of Tax Collection by Brokerage Firms</p>
<p>Representatives from various industries gathered to discuss the issue of brokerage firms collecting business tax. The results were as follows: The Ministry of Finance believes that the practice of brokerage firms collecting business tax from merchants conflicts with the business tax law, and the National Finance Conference has resolved to reform the practice of brokerage firms collecting taxes as soon as possible. The brokerage firms in this county unanimously agree with the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce and propose: 1. Send a letter to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce and convene brokerage firms from neighboring counties to collect opinions and proceed together. 2. Send a telegram to the central government requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to abolish the practice in accordance with the ministry's order, and send a letter to the business tax bureau for its information.</p>

<p>Borrowing 900,000 for Road Construction</p>
<p>The road construction funds in Zhejiang Province are still short by over 3 million yuan. The Construction Department previously sent representatives to Wuhan to borrow 1.2 million yuan from the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, which, together with previous loans, amounted to 3 million yuan. A portion of the road assets in eastern Zhejiang and 1 million yuan in local public bonds were used as collateral. Recently, Xu Ziqing, the manager of the bank, came to Hangzhou, and Zeng Yangfu, the director of the Construction Department, met with him to discuss the matter. The outcome was satisfactory, and it is reported that the loan has been reduced to 900,000 yuan, with the same collateral as before. Other conditions are still being discussed, and it is hoped that an agreement can be reached next month.</p>

<p>Silver Shop Carelessly Loses Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Wenhua Silver Shop, located at the entrance of Tianzhu Street in this port, has been in business for over thirty years. It has a strong capital base and has made considerable profits in the past. However, in recent years, due to the decline of the market and rural bankruptcy, its business has declined sharply, barely managing to survive. Unfortunately, yesterday (the 29th) at around 10 a.m., while the shop was conducting business, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor in the middle. The staff knew it was difficult to extinguish and hurriedly took out several account books and the gold jewelry in the cabinets, fleeing outside. In an instant, the fire spread rapidly. The fire brigade arrived after hearing the news and tried their best to put out the fire. It was finally extinguished by noon. The shop, with three courtyards, was completely destroyed, leaving only the storefront. The total loss is estimated at around 30,000 yuan. It is reported that they only have over 10,000 yuan in fire insurance. The neighboring Gongji Pharmacy, although not burned, suffered several thousand yuan in damage due to water damage.</p>

<p>The first ship, Haiyuan, newly built by the China Merchants Bureau in England, did not stay long when it arrived in Hong Kong and immediately started work in Shanghai. It was reported that it had passed Xiamen the day before yesterday at noon. Yesterday at noon, a telegram came saying that it had passed Wenzhou Yang and was expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The Bureau received a telegram and hired a pilot to guide it to the Tongsha Ocean. It is expected to arrive at the Jin Liyuan Wharf at 3 p.m. The ship will fly the British flag on its way to China. Only after the ship is handed over in Shanghai will the flag be changed.</p>
<p>Carrying overseas Chinese home According to a letter from the British Embassy, there are more than 500 overseas Chinese unemployed in the Netherlands. Whether the Haiyuan will load them all or send them back in batches was not stated in detail in the telegram. Therefore, the number of people is unknown and will be known after the ship arrives.</p>
<p>Factory inspection The Haiyuan was built by the Swan Hunter shipyard in England. According to the contract, the ship will be handed over in Shanghai. The shipyard is responsible for everything on the way. Therefore, the chimney has not yet been painted yellow. After arriving in port this afternoon, it must enter the Jiangnan Factory to inspect the ship's body. If there is nothing wrong, it can be officially accepted. The ship is 343 feet long, 47 feet wide, and 25 feet high to the upper deck and 17 feet and 6 inches high to the clear deck. It can carry 3,200 tons of cargo and travels at 13 knots per hour. The ship has an automatic water meter, direction finder, anti-theft device, and electricity.</p>
<p>Foreign ships depreciate The Haiyuan was originally scheduled to run the Shanghai-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong route and also run Qingdao. However, due to the extended route and the need to stop, each shift takes seven days more, which is not cost-effective. Therefore, Hua Hongsheng decided not to run Qingdao and only run the Shanghai-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong route. Foreign merchants such as Taikoo Company heard that the new ship had arrived in Shanghai. Once the shift started, it would have an impact on the shipping industry. Therefore, the South China water fee had already been reduced by 20% to compete.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and the Netherlands According to the International Trade Bureau, graphite, also known as kyanite, is a carbonaceous mineral. The higher the carbon content, the more valuable it is. Graphite produced in Cumberland, England, contains 92% to 100% carbon and is the best graphite in the world. It is used to manufacture tungsten, antimony, pencils, batteries, paints, stoves, lubricating powders, and is an indispensable raw material in the metallurgical industry. The Netherlands Commercial Visit Bureau sent a letter seeking Chinese graphite miners and exporters for direct negotiations. It is hoped that miners will send a letter to the bureau for introduction.</p>
<p>Germany Needs Tungsten, Antimony, Lead and Tin China's crucible ore production accounts for almost 70% of the world. It has a wide range of industrial uses and is a necessary product for manufacturing munitions. Lead and tin are important raw materials for making lead pipes and tinplate, and are sold in large quantities every year. The German KACRO Company needs a large amount of tungsten seedlings, antimony ash, lead filings, crushed tin, etc. Mineral exporters can send a letter to the company for introduction and sales overseas.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Seafarer Disturbance Expands Merchants Yesterday Decided to Suspend Flights The Chunhe Wheel Was the First Flight to Be Suspended Due to the Customs' Failure to Close the Flight. The Company Is Not Responsible for Passengers and Goods and Appealed to the Departments. <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng, after the Shanghai and Hankou District Seafarer Management Committee announced the seafarer rules, the merchants unanimously opposed them and appealed to the departments. Yesterday, the Shanghai Customs implemented the appointment of seafarers by the Seafarer Management Committee, otherwise it would not be closed. The merchants decided to suspend flights at a general meeting yesterday and notified all passengers to pay attention. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Implemented Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai and Hankou seafarer rules were announced and implemented on October 1, the merchants strongly opposed them. So far, it has not been resolved. Yesterday, the Shanghai Customs suddenly implemented the new seafarer rules. All ships sailing from Shanghai to the Yangtze River must hire seafarers who have passed the qualification of the Seafarer Management Committee. The seafarer's license issued by the former Navy Department's training school is invalid. The Chunhe of the Hefeng Shipping Company was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Nanjing yesterday. Because the seafarer Yu Ningao, although he held a seafarer's license from the Navy Department's training school, was not a seafarer who had passed the qualification of the Seafarer Management Committee, he was rejected and the flight was not closed, so the Chunhe could not leave the port and was anchored at buoy 27 in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Decided to Suspend Flights <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Related merchants, after receiving the Hefeng Company's report, held an emergency meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 5 p.m. yesterday. More than 30 representatives from Sanbei, Ningshao, Zhengji, Haichang, Zhaoxing, and Hefeng Companies, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Bofen, Chen Ganqing, Chen Shuntong, and Sun Bingtang, attended. Yu Qiaqing chaired the meeting and reported on the incident of the Chunhe being refused to close the flight. As this matter concerned the vital interests of the merchants, it was unanimously resolved on the spot that the Shanghai Customs must appoint seafarers from the Seafarer Management Committee before both parties have consulted, otherwise the flight will not be closed and the flight will be suspended temporarily. 2. The transportation of passengers and goods to various passengers and goods in the Yangtze River will be postponed. 3. Send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, etc. to petition that the flight must be closed before both parties have held a meeting. 4. Send a letter to the General Customs Office that the flight must not be refused. 5. Notify the various passengers and goods that the goods loaded will inevitably be delayed and delivered, and it will be difficult to take responsibility. The meeting did not end until 7 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Notice to Passengers <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association sent a notice to various passengers and goods in the Yangtze River yesterday, which reads: "Dear Sirs, the Seafarer Management Committee has implemented the new Shanghai and Hankou Seafarer Regulations since October 1. Various ships could not afford to bear the burden and publicly discussed the measures on September 27. If the customs does not close the flight, they will have to suspend the flight and wait for a solution, and a notice was published in the newspaper on September 29 to inform the various passengers and goods. Today, the Chunhe was scheduled to sail to Nanjing, and the Shanghai Customs had to appoint seafarers from the Seafarer Management Committee before both parties had consulted and resolved the issue, otherwise the flight would not be closed. The relevant companies have already held a general meeting and decided that the flight must be suspended temporarily. Later ships will also be suspended if the customs still does not allow the flight to be closed. There is no other way. Therefore, it is inevitable that the goods transported will be delayed and delivered, and the merchants will not be able to take responsibility. Please understand."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chamber of Commerce's Elegant Telegram <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Navy yesterday, "(Title omitted) On the 29th of this month, it was reported that the Shanghai and Hankou Seafarer United Petition Group stated in a letter that the seafarer of various ports in our country have been almost completely occupied by foreigners. Currently, the only remaining one who can slightly protect the remaining situation is the Yangtze River line, which is the Yangtse Pilot of the people and others who are engaged in the business. The Yangtze Pilot's service here did not initially rely on the government's advocacy, and was entirely due to the individual's tragic battle. Because the seafarer business is of great importance, the national defense and military opportunities above, and the commercial transportation below, all depend on it. Therefore, we have always held a death-defying attitude towards the foreigners' clever seizure and plunder. The suffering has been more than once. However, the Customs' foreign employee has recently used the name of the Seafarer Management Committee to abuse his power and illegally conduct examinations, excluding the qualifications of the people and others. From November 1, they will not be allowed to serve as before, and they will be arbitrarily manipulated, which is nothing more than creating monopoly opportunities for foreigners, increasing the seafarer rates for national ships. If this move succeeds, not only will the business of Chinese shipping inevitably tend to losses and closures, but the national Yangtse Pilots will also inevitably tend to losses and closures, and the national Yangtse Pilots will also have their livelihoods cut off and completely destroyed. The two-pronged approach is extremely vicious, and the examination procedures have many shady scenes. Moreover, the people and others are all graduates of the Seafarer Training School organized by the Navy Department, and hold certificates and permits for seafarer service. As for the Yangtze River seafarer, it is not unique to the Chinese. There are still foreigners of British, German, and Japanese nationalities who control it. If the Navy's foreign employee has nothing else in mind and emphasizes the recovery of our national sovereignty, then various restrictions will be placed on foreign seafarer. Their conspiracy is to come up with hundreds of tricks to exclude the Chinese and falsely recover the virtual name of seafarer, robbing the real power and will not stop until the Chinese seafarer are completely destroyed. Such partial protection of the same kind, the extermination of the livelihoods of hundreds of Chinese people, and placing them in a deadly situation, are vicious and poisonous, equal to snakes. In short, the livelihood of the people is a small matter, but the national sovereignty is no small matter. Now that the people and others have been subjected to this oppression, they have to fight together and organize the Shanghai and Hankou Seafarer Petition Group to appeal to the government's departments for redress. Only your association also has representatives participating in the Management Committee. For this illegal dismissal by the Tax Secretary, it seems appropriate to maintain and express dissent for the seafarer's side, so that foreigners will not arbitrarily act and ask your association to review and grant assistance. Please also telegraph the government and inform the Tax Secretary to abolish the foregoing selection to protect sovereignty and maintain shipping. Therefore, after the meeting, it was found that the navigation seafarer of various ports in our country were indeed controlled by foreigners. Only a few people can perform the seafarer duties by the Chinese, that is, the Yangtse Pilot. The Custom's foreign employee, in the name of the Seafarer Management Committee, excludes those who hold graduation certificates from the Navy Department's Seafarer Training School and permits for seafarer service, deliberately excludes those who hold graduation certificates from the Navy Department's Seafarer Training School and permits for seafarer service, and exhausts their efforts. The Yangtze River seafarer are also not able to intervene. The relationship between our national sovereignty and the shipping industry is not superficial. It is reasonable to state the facts and ask the ministry to review and correct the Shanghai Custom's Tax Secretary's arbitrary dismissal of the Shanghai and Hankou seafarer and give the seafarer protection in order to maintain sovereignty. To the beginning of public gratitude, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows to print."</p>

<p>There are more than 120 seafarers in the Shanghai and Hankou District who hold licenses from the Navy Department's Seafarer Training School. About 70 of them passed the examination by the China Seafarer Management Committee this time. About 50 of them failed the examination. Those who failed the examination have licenses and are old seafarers. They organized the Shanghai and Hankou Seafarer United Petition Group to petition the authorities. After the Chunhe case occurred yesterday, Zhang Ruiqing, the seafarer of the German-owned Hae Ne Maele ship, was dismissed by the foreign company because he was one of those who failed the examination and was replaced by a qualified person. It is reported that the petition group is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight to petition the departments.</p>

<p>The Kwok Man News Agency reports: The Shanghai Fifth Avenue Shipping Bureau, due to the Customs' insistence on employing river pilots recruited by the Customs, convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The meeting commenced at 4:00 PM and lasted for two hours. According to sources, the meeting passed two resolutions: First, since the "Chun He" steamship is not allowed to clear customs, it will temporarily suspend its voyages and negotiate with the Customs. If the Customs insists on hiring its own river pilots, all voyages will be suspended. Second, the Shipping Bureau will adhere to the Ministry of Navy's orders, recognizing only Ministry of Navy licenses. Any pilot holding a Ministry of Navy license may be hired by any company at its discretion.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Zheng Zenan Discusses Guangdong's Sugar Production Plan <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Province, citing the protection of local industrial products, imposes a 20% import duty on goods from other provinces shipped to Guangdong. Shanghai-made machine-made goods shipped to Guangdong are required to pay supplementary taxes. After the manufacturers reported this to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it dispatched executive committee member Zheng Zenan to Guangdong to meet with Chen Bonan and explain that promoting domestic goods and protecting industries should be considered from the perspective of the entire nation, and should not focus solely on one region. If Guangdong imposes import duties on domestic goods, and other provinces follow suit, the harm would be unimaginable. After this request, Chen immediately agreed to Zheng's request that goods manufactured by factories established by Chinese nationals would be exempt from import duties in Guangdong. However, this exemption would not apply to goods manufactured by factories established in Shanghai with foreign capital. Zheng stated that in the future, domestic goods shipped to Guangdong with a certificate issued by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce would be exempt from import duties. Chen agreed to inform the Finance Department to handle the matter accordingly. Zheng also spoke with reporters from this newspaper in detail about Guangdong's sugar production plan, which is well worth recording.</p>
<p>Establishing Sugar Refineries: Guangdong Province is currently implementing a three-year industrial plan, and the sugar manufacturing industry has been brought under provincial management. Zheng visited the provincially run sugar refineries in Guangdong. Currently, there are four refineries. The machinery is supplied by England and Czechoslovakia. To pay for the machinery, 20% of the price is paid upon arrival of the goods, and the remainder is paid in 15 installments after sugar production begins. At the beginning of operations, raw materials were purchased from Java. The provincial authorities have now designated four areas for sugarcane cultivation. The province lends farmers 25 yuan per mu of sugarcane fields. It is estimated that each mu of sugarcane fields requires a cost of 60 yuan from planting to harvest. The provincial authorities now pay farmers 90 yuan per mu of sugarcane, so many farmers are leasing sugarcane fields. Currently, there are over 400,000 mu in the province. There are also over 50 types of sugarcane seeds at the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, with excellent growth and development.</p>
<p>Excellent Results: Each mu yields 100 dan of sugarcane. According to experiments, 12 dan of raw sugar can be produced from this. The fuel used in sugar production is sugarcane dregs instead of coal, so the cost is lower. Currently, each dan of raw sugar costs 7.5 yuan for sugarcane and about 1.5 yuan for other expenses. The provincial export tax is 0.7 yuan, so the total cost per dan is 10 yuan. Currently, the provincial sugar from Guangdong sells for 16.5 yuan per dan in Shanghai, so the profit is considerable. According to reports from Guangdong Province, this year alone, the net profit from sugar refining and the control of native sugar production has exceeded 5.6 million yuan. From New Year's Day next year, it is estimated that 800,000 dan can be produced annually. Currently, the southwestern provinces do not use foreign sugar; people have switched to eating sugar produced in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Aggressive Expansion: Chen Jitang also told Zheng that Guangdong Province</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>has had success in the sugar manufacturing industry and is planning an aggressive expansion. The sugarcane planting area will be expanded to five districts. Currently, about 400,000 farmers are engaged in sugarcane cultivation. Next year, the number of sugar refineries will be increased from four to fifteen. At that time, the total annual output can be increased to 3 million dan. It is estimated that the surplus profit will be 16-17 million yuan per year. If this continues, foreign sugar can be completely defeated within five years. Fujian authorities are also proposing to increase sugar production, but the sugarcane planting area in Fujian Province is only in the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen areas, which is not as large as Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Foreign Sugar: Zheng also said that at its peak, Java had 175 sugar refineries, producing over 2.4 million tons of raw and refined sugar annually. In recent years, the world's production capacity has gradually recovered. In its largest sales area, sugar refineries have successively closed down. Currently, there are only 45 refineries left. The government has also limited annual production to 500,000 tons. The sugar currently being shipped to China is from the 1932 inventory. The cost of Java sugar is 4.25 Dutch yuan per dan. It is now sold to China for 2.75 Dutch yuan per dan, resulting in a huge loss. Adding the 13.6 yuan import tax, it sells for 19 yuan, leaving no room for profit. Zheng also said that if the central government can keep the import tax on sugar unchanged for a long time, foreign sugar can be eliminated within five or six years.</p>

<p>Funds Still Advanced by the Central Bank</p>
<p>The Sin Sin News Agency reports: Regarding the buyback of shares by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Ministry of Communications yesterday issued a special order to the board of directors of the company, stating: Previously, the company reported that the Central Bank's handling of the buyback of shares had ended, and that there were still unredeemed shares. It requested that the Ministry of Finance allocate funds to be kept on deposit. The Ministry of Finance was consulted and the matter was noted on file. Now, the Ministry of Finance has replied that the total amount of funds already advanced and still needed to be advanced, as stated in the original report, is consistent with the numbers jointly reported to the Executive Yuan by your ministry and this ministry. In addition to instructing the Central Bank to continue to advance funds according to the original plan if shares are submitted later, a corresponding reply is hereby issued for your information. Furthermore, the total amount of funds already advanced and still needed to be advanced, as reported previously, is 2,993,902.03 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Rice Similar to Japanese Rice Verified as Tribute Rice <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>2,500 bags of foreign rice, transported from Shandong by the Yu Shun steamer, arrived in Shanghai via Guangdong. After samples were sold in the market, because the rice grains were a mixed of long and round types, with a coarse and white color, resembling Taihu rice, most traders were unwilling to purchase it. However, in order to clarify the source and origin of this foreign rice, the trade association inspected the rice samples and hired rice industry experts to conduct a detailed study. The results showed that the rice was a mixed type of Saigon rice. Therefore, each bag contained both long and round grains. It was determined that this rice must have been purchased from Saigon by Guangdong merchants and then milled in Guangdong rice mills. Since Guangdong did not impose import taxes on foreign rice, it was re-exported to Shanghai for sale. Therefore, 1,500 bags arrived yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Two Railway Administrations Establish Goods Standard Sample Showroom <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, upon the decision of the Goods Standard Freight Rate Research Committee, have established a Goods Standard Sample Showroom at the Shanghai North Railway Station. It is based on the goods obtained by the two railways participating in the National Railway Line Product Exhibition and supplemented by samples solicited from merchants. They are classified and displayed. It has been arranged and will open on November 1st. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM on that morning, guests from all walks of life will be invited to visit. The preparation process and the goods that have been collected, as well as the main purpose of the establishment, are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Preparation Process: In August of last year, the Railway Bureau's Goods Standard Freight Rate Research Committee passed a proposal for the establishment of a Goods Standard Sample Showroom, with the location being the Shanghai North Railway Station. Since the facility is closely related to transportation and business operations, the Railway Bureau entrusted the Transportation Department to handle the preparations. In March of this year, the Transportation Department submitted its preparatory opinions, and responsible personnel were immediately assigned to carry out the work. By mid-May, the arrangements had begun to take shape. On June 19th, the original arrangements were deemed unsatisfactory, and an expansion plan was formulated and implemented in an orderly manner. Currently, there are approximately 835 types of goods and 6,208 pieces on display, divided into five major categories: domestic goods, Chinese and foreign goods (with Chinese and foreign products listed side-by-side for comparison), famous products along the railway line, major transportation items of the railway, and special-price items of the railway.</p>
<p>Significance of Establishment: There are two main purposes for the establishment of the showroom: (A) The calculation of freight rates by the railway is based on goods standards. However, there are many types of goods in the world, and Chinese railways are currently only divided into six standards. Whether the items that have been listed are appropriate, how to classify those that have not been listed, and which standard to classify those that are questionable are all problems. Furthermore, the railway authorities are planning to divide the six standards into ten, so it is appropriate to prepare data in advance for reference. However, it is difficult to ensure suitability without knowing the quality, size, and difference of the actual goods. Therefore, it is necessary to collect samples of goods for research on goods standards. (B) The railway's freight transportation is based on the principle of fully utilizing the tonnage of freight trains. However, how to improve packaging to benefit the railway's own business and reduce the freight costs for merchants can only be achieved by observing the actual goods. Therefore, it is necessary to collect samples of goods for research on packaging methods. In addition, there is an ancillary purpose, which is to display the types, quantities, and values of local products for investigation and transport by sellers, in order to develop local resources. It also allows passengers to browse during their waiting time, gaining a deep understanding of domestic goods and encouraging them to purchase them. It is also heard that after the opening of the showroom, there are plans to schedule visits for elementary school students to foster their awareness of protecting domestic goods, and to invite students receiving commercial education to visit for research on commodities.</p>
<h3 id="e124">New Life Movement on the Two Railways <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Practical Work Already in Progress</p>
<p>Rules and Conventions Announced the Other Day</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways began implementing the New Life Movement early. When the New Life Movement was announced in Nanchang on February 29th, it gave all railway employees a deep understanding of the New Life Movement. Subsequently, on March 24th, the New Life Movement Promotion Association was established by the Railway Administration in conjunction with the Special Party Headquarters. After assigning personnel to make preparations, it was finally decided to formally establish it on August 5th. Because the headquarters had practical work on health and other aspects for the New Life Movement on the railways, on September 3rd, a meeting was convened by the headquarters to reorganize in accordance with the instructions. While this was being implemented, on September 21st, the revised Organizational Outline of the New Life Movement Promotion Association of each railway and the newly revised Organizational Rules of the New Life Movement Service Corps of each railway, issued by the headquarters on September 18th, were received. On October 16th, a meeting was convened to revise the organizational regulations and detailed rules of the New Life Movement Promotion Association of this railway. The director of the Railway Administration, the chief of the Police Department, the director of the Affairs Department, the director of the General Affairs Department, the director of the Mechanical Department, the deputy director of the Engineering Department, and a representative from the Special Party Headquarters served as executive officers. A service corps was established for each of the six sections of the railway: road, car, engineering, mechanical, and police. On the 17th, it was resolved that the first phase of the New Life Convention of the railway would consist of 16 articles. On the 26th, Huang Boqiao (Director of the Railway Administration) was temporarily replaced by Deputy Director Wu, concurrently serving as Weiguo (Director of the Transportation Department), and Li Yuansan (Standing Committee Member of the Special Party Headquarters) were appointed as standing executive officers. The heads of each group of executive officers were also designated, including Jiang Shouzhi for the secretariat group (Chief Secretary), Hu Jizong (Chief of the Personnel Section of the General Affairs Department) for the investigation group, Feng Qili (Engineer of the Su-Song Engineering Section) for the design group, and Ma Shaoping (Chief of the Police Department) for the implementation group. In addition to reporting to the New Life Movement Promotion Association and the Ministry of Railways, the association announced the aforementioned regulations, detailed rules, the list of executive officers for the first phase of the convention, and the list of executive officers for each group on October 30th.</p>

<p>Bi Jingqian, the county magistrate of Danyang County, Yin Heqing, chairman of the Relief Branch, Jiang Kesheng, standing committee member of the Drought Relief Committee and chairman of the Red Cross Branch, and Gong Liqing, director of the Investigation Section of the Relief Committee, came to Shanghai together on the 28th, taking advantage of the 20th anniversary celebration of the Shanghai Danyang Compatriot Association, and telegraphed Jiang Zhengchan, the current magistrate of Jiaxing County and fellow villager, to come along to report on the disaster situation to the compatriots in Shanghai. Yesterday, they also went to the Renji Charity Hall and the Shanghai Drought Relief Association to visit Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Qiang Xiaolin, Zhao Jinqing, Yu Zuoting, Qian Jingping, and other gentlemen to present letters and disaster situation reports seeking relief. They also visited Ma Xiangbo, a prominent elder of Yangyi, at the Tushanwan Catholic Church. Mr. Ma inquired in detail about the disaster situation in his hometown and was deeply moved. He promised to comply with the request of the Compatriot Association and not hold a birthday celebration for his 95th birthday this year, but to ask his friends and former officials to transfer their congratulatory gifts to benefit the disaster victims. He also said that he had previously contributed funds to help with the Tanhe River project in his hometown. Now that his strength is gradually weakening, he can only transfer it to his disciple Yu Youren to do it. As Bi and Jiang were also students of Mr. Ma and old friends with President Yu, he instructed them to convey his intentions and ask him to write 100 pairs of couplets and sell them to raise funds for relief. Those who admire the old model of Mr. Ma and the calligraphy of Mr. Yu will surely rush to buy them. That evening, Pei Yuanding, the representative of the Standing Committee of the Compatriot Association, hosted a banquet. The county magistrate, the chairman, and the Jiang brothers invited the members of the association and the gentry and merchants in Shanghai to accompany them. During the banquet, the Jiang brothers spoke, saying that the soldiers and civilians were suffering from hunger and cold, and they could not eat here. They planned to raise at least 30 groups of 500 yuan each, so that they could receive the relief funds distributed by the provincial government in full. The brothers were willing to initiate the donation and each recognize a group. Wen Chen was greatly moved. Starting with County Magistrate Bi, some recognized two groups, some recognized one group, and some jointly recognized one group. In a short time, a total of 9,000 yuan was raised. The next day, Chen Yuming and Di Gui, famous doctors in Shanghai, hosted a dinner and invited the gentry and merchants who had not attended today to continue the fundraising. With the sincerity of County Magistrate Bi, the example of the Jiang brothers, and the long-standing good relations between the county and the people, it is certain that the target can be met. What is most commendable is that Yuan Zhubingyuan, who lived in Danyang during the drought years, generously recognized 500 yuan alone. Mr. Yuan founded the Xietanglou Adhesive Factory, which is famous in Shanghai. He has always donated generously to the fire prevention and epidemic prevention efforts in Danyang. His chivalrous spirit and loyalty are admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Board of Directors of the Jin Ting Guild Hall Seeks Relief for the Disaster Victims in Dongting Xishan <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Jin Ting Guild Hall in Dongting Xishan, Shanghai, has stated that the disaster in their hometown this year is extremely severe and the livelihood of the villagers has been cut off. Yesterday, they sent a special letter to the Shanghai Drought Relief Association, requesting the allocation of funds to relieve the disaster and save the people. The original letter is as follows: We humbly submit that our hometown, Dongting Xishan, which belongs to Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, is the 13th autonomous region, isolated on Taihu Lake, with simple customs and a population of nearly 40,000. In the past, the people relied on the three major products of rice, fruit trees, and mulberry for their livelihoods. However, in recent years, natural disasters have occurred, and there has been almost no year with a good harvest. For example, the locust plague in the 19th year and the subsequent flood in the 20th year resulted in no grain being harvested. Later, severe cold caused havoc, freezing the lake and killing the fruit trees. In the most prosperous era of mulberry cultivation, the annual income was 500,000 yuan. However, due to the tragic decline of the silk market and the daily decline of prices, coupled with successive years of poor harvests, silkworm farmers have no intention of raising silkworms. To this day, it has fallen drastically, and the harvest is less than one-tenth of what it used to be. The rural economy has already reached an extreme state of recession. Unexpectedly, this year, from summer to autumn, the weather was extremely dry, with no rain at all. Most of the farmland in our hometown is located at the foot of the mountains, making it difficult to draw water. The area that has not been planted accounts for 50-60%. Even the few fields that are relatively low and can be rescued with water are affected by delayed planting, unsuitable climate, and locust damage, resulting in infertile ears. Statistics show that the average harvest in Jinshan is only 15%. As for fruit trees, although there are trees that have not died from the freezing years and are waiting to recover, they are now completely dead due to the effects of drought and cracked soil. No fruit is produced. The lack of goods and price changes is a small matter, but the fruit production that the farmers have cultivated with decades of hard work has suddenly withered, which has a huge impact. In addition, the silkworm production in spring, summer, and autumn was completely unsuccessful, and the price was particularly low. The three major products that the entire mountain relies on for survival have been completely taken away by the weather and the land, with no harvest at all. Such frequent disasters have emptied the granaries. The tragic scene is everywhere. The children are crying for food and cold. How can they continue? Our association is eager to save our hometown, but our hearts and minds are not enough. We have always admired your association's kindness, compassion, and concern. We have no river boundaries. We have already resolved at the sixth standing meeting of our association to publicly elect Directors Xu Jisheng and Xu Huimin and prepare an official letter to come forward and request you to implement benevolence early and distribute righteousness immediately, either by sending staff from your association to the mountain to distribute relief or by allocating relief funds to our association for responsible distribution, so as not to prolong the wait.</p>

Then, they discussed one case to determine the disaster situation in each county, two cases to assign the implementation of relief to each group, three cases to determine the number of relief funds and goods distributed by the Zhejiang Relief Association to the counties, and four cases to ensure that one million relief bonds are redeemed for cash and that emergency relief is distributed in advance.

<p>Wishes the University Federation to Sincerely Advise Students</p>
<p>Wishes the Authorities to Issue Licenses and Impose Restrictions</p>
<p>Kong Xiangzhao, Wang Zhengyan, Wang Wanbai, Wang Hong, You Shuxun, Shi Youhui, Li Denghui, Zhu Haoran, Shen Weixin, Zhou Zhiyu, Jin Yanqing, Zhu Guishen, Yu Zhiqi, Chen Jinyong, Yao Shiyang, Weng Guoxun, Zhang Zhijiang, Dong Jingan, Zhao Jinqing, Xue Daibi, Xie Songgao, and others, executive committee members of the Shanghai Regional Group of the Chinese Christian Believer's National Salvation Ten-Person Group, wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Municipal Council of the French Concession, the University Federation, and various universities: We, the Group, uphold the Christian doctrine of faith and action and advocate for national salvation through self-renewal. We have been established for many years. Although our talents and abilities are limited and unable to remedy the difficulties of the times, we are nevertheless outspoken and strive to reverse the decline of customs and the state of society. We cannot remain silent on matters that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Based on our humble opinions, we offer our services. We hope that you will understand. Recently, the Standing Committee of our National Executive Committee approved the proposal of Standing Committee members Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, and Zhu Guishen to trace back to the Eastward spread of Europe, and dance halls have been established in various parts of our country, especially in Shanghai. In recent years, the world economy has been depressed and all industries have been in decline, but the business of dance halls has developed surprisingly. Although dance halls are a popular activity in Europe and the United States, our country's etiquette and moral education are declining day by day. Young men and women are fascinated by foreign lifestyles and customs, and are flocking to dance. The abuses are truly unbearable. Looking at Shanghai, they are everywhere. Those who enter them display luxury, spending money like dirt. The number of those who run out of money and ruin their families is numerous. Moreover, they spend all night, living in a drunken stupor, wasting time and losing their jobs. Nothing is worse than this. Young students, whose blood and energy are not yet stable, neglect their studies once they enter dance halls. Their spirits become more and more depressed. One wrong step can lead to eternal regret, harming society without end. Young people are increasingly falling into decline. We ask you to advise the students in each university to give priority to their studies and not to set foot in dance halls, so as to avoid decline. We also send letters to the principals of major secondary schools, stating that students who set foot in dance halls should be rejected in the future, so that young students will know what to be vigilant about. On the other hand, we ask the authorities to set appropriate restrictions on the issuance of business licenses for dance halls. Young people who are of school age should not frequent them, so that society can be saved and the country can benefit. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. After unanimous resolution, this has been recorded. Therefore, in addition to sending separate letters, this matter concerns the safety and security of society. We hope that you will agree. We have recorded this and respectfully submit it, requesting that you examine and handle it. With our highest regards, we send this to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Municipal Council of the French Concession, the University Federation, various universities, the Shanghai Regional Group of the Chinese Christian Believer's National Salvation Ten-Person Group.</p>

<p>Date… November 25th</p>
<p>Location… Lake Society at the Guizhou Road Intersection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association's spring general meeting this year was previously ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to revise its articles of association and restore the system of a chairman's council as it existed before 1927. The association complied with the order by forming a drafting committee five times and convening a general meeting to review the draft regulations. However, due to an insufficient number of attendees, the meetings failed to achieve a quorum and were adjourned without resolution, delaying the matter until now. This issue remains unresolved. Currently, the association has scheduled its autumn regular general meeting for 2:00 PM on Sunday, November 25th, at the Lake Society Meeting Hall, located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road in the Public Concession. In addition to submitting the revised articles of association for review, other important proposals will also be discussed. The association yesterday submitted separate reports to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Chief Prosecutors of the three local courts in the city, requesting that prosecutors be dispatched to attend the meeting for supervision and guidance. Furthermore, all members have been notified to make time in their schedules to attend and participate in the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Kidnappers Swallow Ransom Money and Commit Murder <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Fang Yongmao Deserves Ten Thousand Deaths</p>
<p>Younger Brother Also Involved and Arrested</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyu, a Ningbo native who runs a dried goods store in Lujia Stone Bridge, Nanshi, and his son Sidi were kidnapped without a trace in their hometown in October 1932. Later, the kidnappers sent a letter demanding a ransom. The Zhou family entrusted Fang Yongmao, an acquaintance, to negotiate with the kidnappers repeatedly, eventually agreeing to a ransom of 17,000 yuan. The Zhou family managed to raise 17,000 yuan and handed it over to Fang to go to the bandit's den to redeem the hostages. However, Fang, seeing the money, became greedy and harbored ill intentions. He absconded with the money to Shanghai, hiding at 195 Zhonghua Road. The kidnappers, seeing the negotiations broken off, believed that the Zhou family was not sincere and murdered Zhou Guangyu and his son. The Zhou family, seeing that Fang Yongmao had taken the money to redeem them and had not been heard from for a long time, harbored many suspicions. Later, they received a letter from the kidnappers stating that the hostages had been murdered. Only then did they realize that Fang Yongmao had absconded with the money. After repeated searches, the Zhejiang Security Team finally arrested him in Shanghai this spring and escorted him back to Zhejiang for interrogation. Now, Yu Jishi, Director of the Zhejiang Security Office, found that Fang's younger brother, Fang Yongsheng, was suspected of collusion and deception in the case. Yesterday, he specially prepared a document and sent detectives Hong Yutian and Zhang Shijie to Shanghai, requesting the Yemiao Police Station to send police to assist in the arrest. Chief Liu immediately dispatched Li Sixin to accompany them, and Fang Yongsheng was arrested. After interrogation, he was sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Many Lawsuits Involving Longhua Temple <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Abbot Xingkong Owes Money</p>
<p>Mediation Fails, Lawsuit Imminent</p>
<p>Since Abbot Guangzhao left the temple and went elsewhere, the Buddhist Council decided to elect a suitable person to take over on December 1st of last year. Venerable Xingkong, from Mount Emei in Sichuan, was introduced as being old, virtuous, and suitable for the role. On the 5th of that month, Xingkong arrived at the temple and took over, discovering that a portion of the temple property, such as the shops in front of the temple, had been leased to Hu Su Ji by the former abbot Yuanzhao, with Hu Su Ji collecting rent. Xingkong then sued Yuanzhao and Hu Su Ji in the Shanghai District Court for colluding to lease the property and infringing on temple property. As a result, Yuanzhao lost the case. Subsequently, Fangcheng, a monk from the temple, accused Xingkong and Chen Shaodan and others in the District Court Prosecutor's Office of coercion and intimidation to publish corrections. As a result, Chen Shaodan was fined 50 yuan. At the same time, Xingkong and Lu Mingzhao from the temple also sued Yuanzhao in the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the court for encroaching on temple property, requesting thorough investigation. The Public Security Bureau arrested Yuanzhao and translated the small leather suitcase (containing all the deeds) and sent it to the District Court. Prosecutor Wu Deying interrogated him and sentenced him to detention pending investigation. It is now learned that Monk Fangcheng recently hired lawyer Peng Bujing to apply to the District Court Mediation Chamber for mediation. The facts are that on the sixth day of the fourth lunar month this year, Abbot Xingkong borrowed 500 yuan from Fangcheng, with two promissory notes (one for 200 yuan and one for 300 yuan). The promissory notes are kept in the Prosecutor Hu Deying's file (because Fangcheng is Yuanzhao's disciple, he stored the promissory notes with his teacher, kept in a small leather box), stating that interest would accrue at a rate of one percent per month and that the money would be repaid in full within two months, with monks Yongchan, Dafen, and Liaoyuan from the temple as guarantors. Because repeated demands were unsuccessful, he had no choice but to pursue legal action. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Zuyu held a hearing for mediation. The applicant, Fangcheng, was represented by lawyer Peng, who stated the previous situation. The opposing party, Xingkong, was absent due to illness, but Yongchan and Dafen attended, stating that Abbot Xingkong did borrow the money, but had paid 50 yuan. Lawyer Peng rose to refute, stating that the 50 yuan was for interest, and the opposing party should pay 500 yuan at once. However, Yongchan insisted on repaying in three installments. Lawyer Peng objected, and the judge ruled that mediation had failed, instructing the applicant to file a formal lawsuit. Longhua Temple is truly troubled.</p>

<p>Zeng Yanhua Admits Guilt in Court</p>
<p>Court Conducts Preliminary Inquiry</p>
<p>Zeng Yanhua, a Cantonese man, 31 years old, residing at 8, Lane 77, Zhao Jia Bridge, was a clerk and accountant at the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. Therefore, all money and checks were managed by Zeng. However, according to the funeral home's usual practice, all checks for withdrawals must be co-signed or stamped by the two Westerners, Mr. Seytor and Mr. Brettford. However, the two Westerners could not always be in the same place at the same time. For convenience, Brettford signed the checkbook in advance and gave it to Zeng for management. When a withdrawal was needed, only Seytor's signature was required to withdraw the money. Zeng took advantage of this loophole, imitating Seytor's signature. From May 1st of this year to the end of last month, he forged Seytor's name and stamp on blank check papers and successively collected 2,300 yuan from the Shanghai Citibank, which he used for his own purposes. However, the Wanguo Funeral Home is a company, and every few months, all the books must be submitted to accountant Xue Mailuo for inspection. This time, accountant Xue discovered Zeng Yanhua's fraudulent behavior and reported it to Seytor, who reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which issued an arrest warrant from the First Special Court. Zeng was arrested and detained in the police station yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Chamber of the First Special Court. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the defendant is accused of forging documents in violation of Article 224 of the Criminal Law. Seytor, the plaintiff, and the Western staff of Xue's accounting firm provided evidence proving everything. The defendant confessed that he was a clerk at the funeral home with a monthly salary of 220 yuan and admitted to forging signatures and embezzling funds. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending further hearing in seven days.</p>

<p>Iron Factory Apprentice Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Shi Jinhai, an 18-year-old apprentice from Yuyao, who has been working at the Yuhua Xiang Iron Factory at 582 Fair Road for more than three years, was grinding steel rods on a machine tool at around 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month. He was careless and his head was crushed by the machine. He cried for help, and when his companion Zheng Xuedao heard the sound and rushed over, he quickly closed the machine door and tried to get his head out. However, Shi was severely injured at this time. The factory owner and others rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. He died the next morning at 9:00 AM. The hospital reported to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detective Ji Peijin to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuqi, and others, arrived at the center to examine the body. Chief Hua Pu Shen Baoshan stated the above situation after examining the body. According to Zheng Xuedao, 22 years old, who testified that he did not witness how Shi's head was crushed by the machine. He only heard the cry for help and rushed over, only to find out what happened and immediately turned off the machine to save him. Shi Guishi, the father of the deceased, 52 years old, testified that he usually works in a pharmacy in Ningbo. He just received the news a few days ago and arrived this morning. He only had one son, and now that this unfortunate thing has happened, he requested that the factory provide compensation. After hearing the testimony, Tang ruled that the deceased Shi Jinhai, male, died from a head injury sustained before his death. The body was released to his father, Shi Guishi, with a written guarantee to take it back for coffin burial and advised the factory to give some compensation to the family of the deceased.</p>

<p>Lawyer Huang Huancheng Accused of Bigamy</p>
<p>Repeated Summons Failed, Judge Dissatisfied</p>
<p>Lawyer Huang Huancheng already had a wife in his hometown of Taizhou. Last year, he married Chen Jiying, a young woman from Yixing, in Shanghai. It was not until last month that Chen discovered the bigamy. Huang could no longer stand in Shanghai and quietly fled, his whereabouts unknown. After Huang left, Chen filed a criminal complaint against Huang for bigamy and abandonment with the First Special District District Court. The First Special Court held a hearing once, but it could not proceed because the defendant did not appear. It was postponed to yesterday afternoon, when Judge Wu Zehan summoned him again. The defendant Huang Huancheng still did not appear, making it difficult to open the trial. Judge Wu then ordered the defendant's friends in court to quickly notify the defendant to surrender, saying that Huang is a lawyer and cannot continue to evade legal responsibility in this way, and that evasion will not resolve the matter. He also told Chen Jiying that if the defendant's side could come forward for mediation, she should consider accepting a settlement, as there is no guarantee of victory in litigation. The hearing has been rescheduled to 2:30 PM on the 9th of next month.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency reports that at the Xihe Cotton Mill at 80 Robison Road, Caojiadu, Puxi, Shanghai, which is owned by the Japanese, the guard Yin Bada Xin also lends money at high interest. A month ago, he had a disagreement with his fellow Indian guard, Kaier Xin, over money. Although they reconciled on the surface, they harbored resentment. At about 0:30 AM yesterday morning, Kaier Xin harbored murderous intentions and sought revenge. Taking advantage of the fact that Yin Bada Xin was asleep, he sneaked into Yin's bedroom with a kitchen knife and suddenly attacked Yin, resulting in his left hand being cut off and bleeding profusely. Yin was able to endure the pain and struggle with him, but eventually collapsed on the ground in a pool of blood. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, took the opportunity to escape. Yin Bada Xin groaned and cried for help. When the Chinese police of the cotton mill heard the alarm and rushed over, they discovered that Yin Bada Xin's left arm had been cut off and was covered in blood. The situation was so tragic that they could not bear to look at it. They reported the situation to the manager of the mill and notified the Pudulu Police Station. The chief dispatched detectives to investigate and immediately sent the injured to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. It is said that although the injuries are severe, there is no danger to his life.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Public Works Department Requesting Withdrawal of Hotel Surtax Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating: "Regarding the fact that our Chamber of Commerce has received a letter from the Zheng Lvye Hotel Industry Association on the 29th of this month, stating that since the Public Works Department's surcharge assessment case occurred, our Association's members have been running around in horror, informing each other that the problem is serious. We immediately entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to represent our Association's clients, such as the Great China Hotel, to send a letter to the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, requesting them to forward a letter to the Public Works Department's Donation Office. The details have already been seen in various newspapers, and we believe that your Association is already aware of them. However, the Donation Office, after receiving the Ratepayers Association's letter, not only showed no fairness but also delayed the issuance of winter business licenses for various hotels. This shows that the Donation Office has no sincerity. We dare to clearly state to your Association the hardships of merchants under the current economic downturn. 1. The Donation Office's so-called surcharge assessment is actually a disguised surtax. 2. It has no legal basis because it has not been resolved by the Ratepayers Association. 3. The Donation Office wants to use this to fraudulently change the law and destroy the foundation of the rule of law within the Concession. 4. Recently, the Public Works Department sent a letter limiting hotels to appeal to the Public Works Department's own Appraisal Committee within two weeks; otherwise, it will be deemed tacit approval. From this, it can be seen that the Public Works Department's oppressive situation is obvious, and the establishment of the Appraisal Committee has no value for appeal. However, the situation is serious and has reached its extreme. The facts are stated, and it is difficult to comply. This matter is not only a fact of the hotel industry but also a matter for all ratepayers. We hope that your Association will strive for justice and relieve merchants of harsh taxes. We must remember the autumn of economic depression and depletion. If your Association can make a high-level appeal so that those who intend to collect taxes will realize their slowness and resolutely implement the empty room donation to supplement tax revenue (the method can be seen in the Ratepayers Association's letter to the Public Works Department), then our industry will be fortunate, and the entire city will be fortunate." Based on this, the Chamber of Commerce checked the Public Works Department's case of using room price in each hotel in this city as the standard for estimating the increase in the Police Donation. The Hotel Industry Association opposed it. The Chamber of Commerce has written to you on August 1st and August 17th, stating in detail that the industry cannot afford it and that the increase should be increased, and it is deeply regretted that your bureau did not accept it. According to the previous situation, the previous proposal to estimate and increase the donation by room has not been repealed. Under the economic depression, the hotel industry is forced to bear a donation increase of 50-60% of the original amount. How can the business power win? If a incident is triggered, it will not be a blessing for the citizens of the boundary. Business can win this. If an incident is triggered, it will not be a blessing for the citizens of the boundary. The Chamber of Commerce hereby informs your office again with the facts and requests the cancellation of the increase as stated in our two letters in August to avoid trouble.</p>

The police also dispatched detectives to maintain order. The court police first opened and inspected each confiscated drug, such as red pills, opium, and heroin, and then threw them into the fire.

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Taichang Real Estate Company, the owner of Xiexingfang at the corner of Shilu, yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting the reversal of the one-way traffic measure on Hankou Road. The original letter roughly stated, "Since the implementation of the one-way traffic measure on Hankou Road, business on the entire road has been greatly affected. Taking our Xiexingfang properties as an example, the properties at 4, 5, and 6 Shilu corner, which used to be prosperous, have been vacant for several months. Furthermore, the tenants of the office spaces upstairs in Xiexingfang are about to move out completely because they find the vehicle traffic inconvenient. This situation is unprecedented on other roads recently. It can be seen that the implementation of one-way traffic has caused losses to both landlords and tenants. We request that your bureau consider the difficulties of the merchants and quickly cancel this measure.</p>

<p>The Pudong National Products Exhibition, since its opening, has been extensively reported on in previous newspapers regarding its various promotional activities for national products. The closing ceremony of the exhibition was held yesterday at 1:00 PM, where the chairman, Li Yongfang, along with over eighty representatives from various manufacturers, paid their respects to the Prime Minister and reported on the overall progress of the event. Subsequently, Zhu Yangwu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Shen Yu, representing the Fifth District Party Headquarters, took the stage to deliver speeches, mostly filled with encouragement. The manufacturers expressed their gratitude to the people of Pudong for their enthusiastic support of the event, while also emphasizing the need for continuous improvement and excellence in national products to bring glory to the nation. The logistics of the event were exceptionally well-managed, with strict measures in place to prevent unauthorized access and potential theft.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Coal Industry Association Requests Negotiation with the Public Works Department <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Concession</p>
<p>Regarding the Fine Imposed on Yichengxin Coal Company for Spilled Coal Dust</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Association of this city received a letter from Yichengxin Coal Company on Avenue Edward VII, stating that they were wrongly accused and fined by the Public Works Department for violating regulations due to spilled coal dust during loading and unloading. They requested the Association to forward a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate with the Public Works Department. The Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday, and the original text is as follows: We are writing to inform you that our member, Yichengxin Coal Company, located at the intersection of Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII, reported that it is inevitable that some coal dust will fall on the ground during loading and unloading. However, they have always promptly cleaned it up without causing any issues. Despite this, the garbage collectors from the Public Works Department accused them of violating regulations, disregarding the facts, and repeatedly fined them, with the fines increasing each time. As the company cannot afford to suspend operations even for a day, this continuous fining is unbearable. Therefore, we earnestly request your Association to forward a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Public Works Department's Health Bureau to negotiate and verify the facts, whether there was a violation, and request a waiver of the fine to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses. We await your kind assistance. Based on this, we believe that the above facts are true and clear. The Public Works Department's Health Bureau is listening to only one side of the story and abusing its authority by imposing penalties at every turn, which is truly an intolerable burden. We hereby request your Association to forward a letter to the Public Works Department's Health Bureau in the Public Concession to review the facts, determine whether there was a violation, and waive the fine to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses. We await your kind assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Customs Patrol Ships Go to Lijiang Port to Combat Smuggling <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Seizure of a Large Quantity of Tax-Evaded Rayon and Sugar</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs believes that the residents of Lijiang Port mostly engage in seafaring activities. In this era of developed steamships, there are still twenty-three boat households in the area transporting fish sauce, oil, and other goods to and from Tianjin, Dalian, and other places. However, these boats also carry tax-evaded goods on their return trips, which are then transported inland for sale in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other areas. The amount of such goods is substantial. In order to combat smuggling, the Customs has dispatched two patrol ships, one large and one small, to conduct inspections. The larger ship is stationed outside the port, while the smaller one patrols around the entire island. Any sailing vessel that appears to be heavily laden is boarded and inspected. Yesterday, a small oil tanker fully loaded with rayon and other goods, attempting to smuggle them into Changbai, was seized and towed to Shanghai. At the same time, a sailboat carrying hundreds of bags of sugar was also seized and confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Measures for Ordering the Replacement of Old Public Rickshaws with New Ones <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, recognizing that some public rickshaws are dilapidated and unsafe, urgently needs to replace them with new vehicles to ensure passenger safety. On October 19th, a notice was posted at the rickshaw inspection office on Fair Road, stating: "Notice: Hereby notified that any rickshaws deemed dilapidated by the Rickshaw Inspection Office of this Department will be allowed one month to replace them with new vehicles (the style must conform to the new vehicles specified by this Department). Failure to do so within the deadline will result in the revocation of the license by this Committee. Furthermore, the above measures do not apply to vehicles that are severely dilapidated and unusable. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge."</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, approximately eighty vehicles have been declared as unusable and the owners have been notified by the authorities to replace them with new vehicles within one month in order to continue to obtain licenses. During this one-month period, if the vehicles are adequately repaired, they will be temporarily allowed to be used, but no further extensions will be granted after the deadline. In addition, it has been found that six vehicles are no longer suitable for passengers and cannot be repaired. The owners have been notified that they must provide new vehicles within one month in order to continue to be licensed. During the one-month period, if they wish to temporarily substitute another vehicle, it will be allowed with the consent of the Inspection Office. These measures avoid a temporary reduction in the number of vehicles, which would prevent rickshaw pullers from having vehicles to pull, and it cannot be said that it is difficult for the owners to comply. The Vehicle Committee has always advocated for a gradual approach to replacing vehicles with new models. Existing vehicles that are still usable are allowed to continue to be used.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Municipal Health Bureau Strictly Deals with Cases of Altering Licenses and Illegally Practicing Medicine <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau previously discovered that Chinese medicine practitioner Li Zuolin was falsely claiming to be a physician and illegally operating three Zuolin Western Medicine Hospitals at locations such as Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession and Avenue Minny in the French Concession. In addition to revoking Li Zuolin's Chinese medicine license, the Bureau also ordered the Zuolin Hospitals to cease operations. Recently, the Zuolin Hospitals declared that they would be taken over by others. In order to clarify the truth and supervise improvements, the Bureau dispatched personnel to investigate again the other day. Unexpectedly, they found another doctor, Zhang He, who did not meet the qualifications. Zhang He had privately erased the name of the foreign doctor Robert Holper (Dr. Robert Holper) on the physician registration license issued by the Municipal Health Bureau and replaced it with his own name. He also replaced the photo on the license. The Municipal Health Bureau considered Zhang He's behavior to be illegal and immediately revoked the altered license to be dealt with according to the law. However, Zhang He dared to go to the Bureau to request the return of the aforementioned license. The Bureau then sent the evidence and the suspect to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the court for legal action to deter others from following suit.</p>

<p>The conductor of the No. 416 ticket seller of the public concession tram company in this city, was serving on the 18th Road tram. When the tram arrived at Xieqiao, he was unreasonably beaten and injured by the No. 12 ticket inspector of the French company. This aroused public anger among all the conductors. The Third District Water and Electricity Workers' Union convened a general meeting to discuss solutions and decided to send a letter to the company requesting that it negotiate with the French company to withdraw and punish the violent ticket inspector. They also set a deadline of two days for a reply. Otherwise, when the tram reached the French Concession, they would uniformly stop selling tickets to seek extreme countermeasures. After receiving the letter, the company was deeply concerned that the dispute would escalate, and immediately sent personnel to contact the French company. The French company agreed that the No. 12 ticket inspector would no longer be assigned to serve on English electric trams in order to avoid conflict. If he still engaged in trouble-making behavior, it could be reported and he would be fired immediately. The company authorities then conveyed this intention to the conductors, who were satisfied with the response. Therefore, the dispute has been resolved.</p>

<p>Money is Deceptively Taken Revealing a Vile Countenance</p>
<p>A Moment of Error Leads to Regret and Irreversible Consequences</p>
<p>Wang Yigong, who used to work as a patrolman in the Huishi Police Station, was dismissed by his superiors for dereliction of duty. He then joined the Tianyunlou Theater of Yong'an Company as an inspector. His family lived at No. 20, Meilefang, Huanlong Road, French Concession. This summer, Sang Zhengbang, a wealthy young man from Changming, brought his beautiful wife Luo Xiuzhen (also known as Luo Yulan), who was close to her prime, to Shanghai for sightseeing. The couple stayed in a hotel. Sang had an opium addiction, and every time he returned to the hotel tired from sightseeing, he would order the waiter to buy opium to satisfy his addiction. One night, the police investigated the hotel and found Sang lying on the couch. He was arrested and taken away. His wife, Luo Xiuzhen, was distressed by her husband's crime and urgently wanted to rescue him. However, she was unfamiliar with the area. She remembered that Qiu was a friend of her husband, so she went to ask for help. Qiu then introduced Zhong Dexin, an inspector at the Tianyunlou Theater, to assist. After several discussions, Luo Yuzhen became acquainted with Wang Yigong through Zhong. Wang saw that Luo was young and beautiful and immediately had inappropriate thoughts. He was very attentive to Luo and learned about her husband's situation. He took the opportunity to slander Sang, saying that Sang did not engage in proper business and only wasted money. He claimed that the family property would inevitably be squandered in the future, and it would be unbearable to spend the rest of her life with such a prodigal son. Xiuzhen already hated Sang for being addicted to opium and being imprisoned in a foreign land. Upon hearing these slanders, she mistakenly believed them to be heartfelt words. Zhong Dexin took the opportunity to encourage her, greatly exaggerating Yigong's handsome appearance and straightforward demeanor. He also said that he was unmarried and that if they could form a love relationship, it would be a good match. Surrounded by these influences, Xiuzhen had no choice but to agree. She immediately took her luggage from the hotel and moved to the home of Wang Yingzhou, the editor of the Tianyunlou newspaper. Yigong and she began an illicit relationship, and then moved to Zhabei. Later, they moved to No. 5, Renhuali, Sapaud Road, as if they were husband and wife. When Sang was released from prison, Luo divorced him and asked Wang to hold the wedding ceremony as soon as possible. However, Wang made excuses. Recently, Wang had taken all of Xiuzhen's property and decided to abandon her. Suddenly, on the night of October 12, he called Xiuzhen to the Great Shanghai Hotel and told her that he had resigned from all his positions in Shanghai and planned to go to another port to make a living. He deliberately talked endlessly, and even stayed overnight. The next day, Xiuzhen returned to the apartment and found that all her belongings were gone. Wang had also disappeared. Xiuzhen realized that she had been deceived. In addition to reporting to the Songshan Road Police Station, she also filed a complaint with the Second Special Court accusing Wang Yigong of obstructing morals, abandoning her, and encroaching on her property. Wang suddenly filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against Luo Xiuzhen and Zhong Dexin for breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, both cases were heard simultaneously in the First and Second Courts. However, Luo Xiuzhen had already gone to the Second Special Court, so she could not be present to defend herself against Wang's accusation. Judge Wu Tingqi inquired about the reason and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled to November 8.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps Chinese Company and Translation Team held their annual encampment and awards banquet at the Hongkou shooting range a few days ago, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that this year's encampment focused on shooting, so the routine encampment lessons were reduced. Instead, the professional annual training was held on the 27th and 28th. The 28th annual team shooting competition and the second annual competition of the Chinese Company's Translation Team were held simultaneously, so the shooting range was filled with Chinese members, making it a grand occasion. The weather was sunny and warm, like spring, which added to the excitement of the competitors. The competition was intense and exciting. Among the various competitions, the rapid firing competition in the newly built 300-yard trench was the most intense. The key to victory in the women's competition was the rapid firing. Over the past two days, in addition to the water basin competition and the machine gun competition, which were postponed due to time constraints, the results showed that Chen Shixia had the highest score and won the championship, while Gu Wenzhong came in second with a difference of one point.

<p>Recently, unscrupulous merchants in this city have been smuggling inferior rayon into the country, evading customs duties, causing the domestic silk industry to suffer a setback. As reported in the newspaper the other day, the customs announced that in the past week, patrolmen seized more than 28,000 parcels of rayon smuggled in the Huangpu River, which is shocking. However, the illicit profits are so great that merchants continue to smuggle in rayon. It is now known that a few days ago, the Shanghai Inspection Office, acting on a tip-off, seized six packages of tax-evaded rayon imported from Guangdong in the Qujiaqiao area of Jiangwan. Yesterday, another 20 boxes of rayon were seized at the North Railway Station. The Customs Department's Anti-Smuggling Section has sent personnel to retrieve the goods and is investigating the owners. According to customs officials, under the new customs law, all seized tax-evaded goods will be confiscated and auctioned off if there is no owner. If there is an owner, in addition to confiscating the goods and turning them into debt, they will be subject to double the penalty.</p>

<p>To the Editor, Our law firm represents Cai Zifen in the case of self-accusation against Zhu Ziyun for manslaughter. In the news column of your newspaper on October 28, there was a statement "Changing the prescription was ineffective, but in the end, it was too late to save him and he died." This implies that although Zhou Dong and other doctors changed and exhibited their prescriptions, they were still ineffective and he died, which is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, although Cai Haisun was diagnosed and prescribed medicine by Zhou and Dong on July 26, before the medicine could be taken, Shunbao was unable to take the medicine and died. Cai Zifen clearly stated this in court. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction to avoid confusion. Respectfully, Lawyer Qu Chengqi, 23.10.30.</p>
<p>To the Editor, In the October 29 issue of your newspaper's news column, there was a news item about the Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai holding a revival meeting yesterday, which stated that the association's affairs had been suspended for three years, which is not true. After the war, our association, led by Wang Zhixiang and others, upheld the past achievements and continued at No. 18 Jiaotong Road, but the office was simpler than before. In addition, Zhao Liangchang's name was omitted from the list of committee members. We kindly request that this be corrected. Sincerely, the Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, October 30.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I have read in the local news section of your newspaper on the 25th of this month, there is a news item about the Inland River Shipping Association requesting the punishment of Shi Guangfu, the police chief of Chuansha, and on the same day, according to the telegram from the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Association, the police officer Shi Guangfu of this county's police team boarded a ship without a ticket and brutally beat people, requesting a thorough investigation. At that time, the police team of this county had already been reorganized into a security detachment. After ordering the detachment leader Kang Gonghe to conduct a thorough investigation and reply, it was reported that Shi Guangfu was a former police officer of the police team of this county, but he had already left the team in September of last year. In addition to replying and instructing, as it concerns the police in this county, I am writing to request that you grant a correction. Sincerely, the Chuansha County Government, October 30.</p>
<p>Thank You. Yesterday, the Donggou Municipal Garden Farm in Pudong sent eight pots of chrysanthemums. Thank you.</p>

<p>— Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>Who are we writing for? This is indeed a question worth discussing. When we observe this question superficially, it seems very simple, but when we cut this question open and observe it from its cross-section, we feel that this question is not as simple as we imagined, but a multifaceted and complex problem.</p>
<p>When we talk about the question of who we are writing for, we must also talk about what we are writing and how we are writing. In other words, first, what is our writing object; second, what kind of consciousness do we use to write; and third, what kind of skills do we use to write. We know that our society is definitely not the society of thirty years ago, and the tastes of some of our readers are. Although our readers are a very small part, and most people are still outside the circle of our writing influence, we do not deny that their tastes still follow the tastes of people thirty years ago. To be more clear, there are two typical people outside the circle of our writing influence: the first type is relatively the majority, although they have been drained of their blood by imperialism, although they have been shackled to the point of death by feudal forces, their consciousness is still a relic of the pre-historical period, and their lives are still a prototype of the pre-historical period. Naturally, there is no need to talk about those who cannot read among them, and even the minority among the minority, who can read, are at most bookworms—these bookworms are only limited to corroding the original soft Chinese paper-printed books, as for the tough Western paper-printed books, even if they are slightly corroded, they also have some digestion. This is a typical person.</p>
<p>The other type of people, although they also live in cities, their lives are partially or wholly Westernized, or even in contact with genuine red-haired foreigners every day and every hour, and they speak beautiful foreign languages, but the books they read are the worst works among foreigners, either superstitious books or detective movies. This is the influence of he Tara, which is not only contaminated with the mutton smell of foreigners, but also contaminated with the stubborn prejudices of foreigners, and even the whole superstition of foreigners. Therefore, their views are the most vulgar, their consciousness is the most stubborn, they only know foreigners, but do not know China, they only know individuals, but do not know the masses, and this is another typical person.</p>
<p>These two types of typical people who are outside the circle of our writing influence, although their lifestyles are absolutely different, their consciousness has a common point. Both of them do not value pure literary works much, believing that they are outside the classics of sages and worthies. At most, they regard these things as entertainment after tea and wine. Because they think they are entertainment, their standard of choice, from a formal point of view, is that the simpler the better, so chapter novels that tell one thing from beginning to end are most to their liking. From the content point of view, the more superficial the better, so the joys and sorrows of talented scholars and beautiful women are also the most popular themes for them.</p>
<p>When we investigate why these two types of typical people are like this, we can say that their lives determine their consciousness. They live in another world, and the surging thoughts of the world are isolated from them. Although they live in the 20th century, their consciousness is still in the 19th century. The colonial form seen in today's China has its historical reasons and cannot be eliminated in a short period of time.</p>
<p>We see foreign goods all over the Chinese market: we see warships and merchant ships from various countries coming and going in our inland rivers, we see foreign soldiers running rampant in our country, we see foreign hooligans selling drugs and killing people. In other aspects, we see farmers displaced, we see the national industry collapsing, we see the depression in the cities, we see overseas Chinese being oppressed and returning. These intertwined problems and many other problems that cannot be listed are naturally the objects of writing for modern writers. However, using these complex and intertwined modern Chinese social phenomena as the object of writing is definitely not something that people with fossilized consciousness can handle, nor is it something that the most primitive chapter novels in historical evolution can fully perform their functions. To deal with the themes of modern society and make them artistic and active in front of us, we naturally need to adapt to the mainstream of modern thought as its center, and to fully express this center of consciousness, we naturally need the latest skills. However, we can never obtain some inspiration or new forms from the old antiques of Dream of the Red Chamber, Water Margin, and The Scholars. An old dog cannot do new tricks, and this is not a joke. Not long ago, some writers, in order to obtain universal readers, advocated that chapter novels may be adopted within a considerable range. This retrograde policy is not enough to gain a majority of readers, but is enough to hinder the progress of Chinese literature, so that it will never have the hope of success in great works and standing in the literary world. We know that those who advocate adopting chapter novels believe that the reason why new literature is difficult to approach readers is that its form and content are too Westernized. This is actually the trend of the times. In today's era, we can never write the purely Chinese vernacular language of Shi Nai'an, Cao Xueqin, and Wu Jingzi. On the contrary, if Shi Nai'an, Cao Xueqin, and Wu Jingzi were born today, they would probably write modern language like us. Therefore, those who believe that the language in the essays of the Ming Dynasty or The Brave Old Woman is more wonderful than modern language are either deliberately playing the savage or ignorant of the principle of language evolution. The appearance of great literary works will never be achieved overnight, and the acquisition of a majority of readers cannot be achieved by condescension. We must promote the overall cultural progress of society and raise the level of culture, then the number of readers can naturally increase. Therefore, making new literary works readable by the general public is not something that literature itself can achieve alone, nor is it something that can be achieved under the current state. It also requires external forces to promote it. However, gaining a majority of readers is not something to worry about. Chinese literature is a part of the literature of all countries in the world, and China cannot be an exception to the road taken by the literature of all countries in the world. All those things that run counter to the times, their fortresses will eventually be captured by us. Let's wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Tokyo Correspondence (Part 1) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Japanese Literature Notes</p>
<p>During the first half of the year and at the end of the previous year, the much-discussed issues of literary renaissance have vanished without a trace since I returned to Tokyo after summer vacation. Even the literary magazines that served as the main base for the literary renaissance have recently lost their appeal and cannot penetrate the main current of the literary scene. Recalling the glorious history of waving the banner and taking the lead, one can't help but feel the rapid changes in the Japanese literary world.</p>
<p>Recently, the targets of literary debate and the things being promoted can indeed be said to have shifted towards the issue of "conversion" and the revival of subjectivity.</p>
<p>The issue of "conversion" is not limited to the conversion of left-wing writers but also relates to the conversion of the pure literary faction. The central figures of these two factions are, respectively, the young writer Hayashi Fusao and the grand master of pure literature, Kikuchi Kan. The conversion of Hayashi Fusao's faction is, needless to say, a conversion from proletarian literature to conversion literature (this term is not coined by me). The conversion of Kikuchi Kan's faction is a conversion from pure literature to popular literature (or vulgar literature).</p>
<p>Regarding Hayashi Fusao's faction, there are also Takeda Rintaro, Kataoka Teppei, Murayama Tomoyoshi, and others. Their creative theories are in the same direction as Hayashi and Takeda, but others like Tokunaga Sunao and Murayama largely hold different opinions. This is not because of their different wills to convert, but because of their disagreement on art.</p>
<p>The Napp, the Japanese left-wing writers' organization, has been deprived of its excellent theoretical mentor, Hori Tatsuo. Kobayashi Takiji died young one after another, and Miyamoto Kenji also went underground. The remaining leadership, such as Yamada Seizaburo, are mostly old and incompetent. Kajii Motoji was misled by erroneous political dogmatism theories, causing the Napp to stop its brain work. The sound organization collapsed into a state of ruin. As a result, writers felt the lack of theoretical guidance and the destruction of their creative abilities by past political activism. They rose up to criticize the Napp and declared their transformation. The representatives of this faction are Hayashi Fusao, Tokunaga Sunao, Takeda Rintaro, and others.</p>
<p>Hayashi Fusao is a young man with a strong heroic color. He possesses a very strong atmosphere of art-for-art's-sake. When the Napp was overly active and subjective conditions were strong, Hayashi was indeed a good cell that could be overcome. However, once the Napp weakened, this caused Hayashi to reignite the torch of art-for-art's-sake, as if he could no longer be confined by the shackles of hidden principles. This reignition of the torch indeed shocked the Japanese literary world. His theory is that art absolutely cannot be allowed to be used as a utilitarian tool for politics. As for Murayama Tomoyoshi and others, they converted because of the freedom of life, and theoretically still support the past theories. However, regardless of the theoretical differences, they did form a new faction in creative works, which is conversion literature. The subjects of conversion literature are no different from those of pure literature, and the themes are still revolutionary, but they lack activeness and add more psychological analysis. If too little attention is paid to the activeness of the theme, conversion literature can be said to become psychological analysis literature. For example, Murayama Tomoyoshi's *White Night* is regarded as a masterpiece of the conversion faction. At the same time, these weaknesses are fully exposed. However, there are also good points, such as the absence of excessive political atmosphere and standardized, solidified ideologies.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Baked by the fierce noonday sun, the smell of asphalt blows with the wind to one's nostrils. That strange smell pierces people's nerves. However, the shirtless and barefoot coolies of Geylang raise their T-shaped hoes and vigorously smash the stones on the street. They don't seem to notice at all and work from sunrise to sunset, without any chance to rest.</p>
<p>(So the smooth roads were built by them.)</p>
<p>Pedestrians all wear hats. In the streets of the South Seas, you can see many different hats: the Dutch hats of European businessmen, the red-topped hats of Malays, the silk-ribboned hats of Turks... Women all like to carry umbrellas. The way those *nyonyas* wear slippers and walk sometimes makes people laugh.</p>
<p>The big-headed Indian policeman, carrying a cross, stands at the crossroads directing traffic. He is most afraid when a bullock cart carrying durians or just a cart of green grass comes from afar. The bullocks walk so slowly that passing a street corner often makes cars and carriages wait for ten or twenty minutes.</p>
<p>At this time, the shops are deserted.</p>
<p>Department stores only let the radio play jazz tunes, which drift to the streets. An American young woman sitting in a rickshaw might think of 42nd Street in New York, where there isn't the best jazz band?</p>
<p>(She suddenly has homesickness.)</p>
<p>Silver light flows in, and it gets dark.</p>
<p>(Part 3)</p>
<p>The closed banks, car companies, bookstores, department stores... are quiet, with only one or two lights flashing inside. The Indian doorman also yawns, lying on the sleeping couch outside the thick glass door, hoping that the city sounds will quickly die down so that he can close his eyelids.</p>
<p>The mixed-race prostitute, who has a Spanish father and a Javanese mother, but they have both disappeared. Leaving the 21-year-old her, she has to go out on the street every night, dodging the eyes of greedy and ill-intentioned policemen and detectives. Sometimes she stands under a street lamp post. Sometimes she wanders on the sidewalk. For the cold of the deep night, she sits down in a coffee shop, smokes an elephant brand cigarette, and sobs.</p>
<p>In the streets of the South Seas, the coffee shop is the last to close its doors. Here, there are young guys from Hainan Island. When it's deserted and there are no customers, he will think of his distant hometown, where there are also coconuts and bananas. And how much his mother is looking forward to his return, but....</p>
<p>The unemployed man walks on the street, he has no home tonight. A sigh that fell from the edge of life adds a layer of thick coolness to the night air.</p>
<p>(Where to rest?)</p>
<p>Wandering, street after street...</p>
<p>The night is long, and he doesn't know how much further he has to walk before dawn.</p>

<p>— TK</p>
<h3 id="e183">Small Square (Six) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wei He</p>
<p>I listened to these words as if deaf and mute, gnashing my teeth in pain, a feeling of humiliation piercing deep into my lungs. It was as if I were a little monkey, and my father were a quack doctor outside a theatre, shamelessly selling my little skills, flattering the guests and asking for money, while I myself played a ridiculous role in the midst of loud gongs and drums.</p>
<p>Those round-faced gentlemen gathered closely around the square table on which I was writing. I wrote with difficulty, but they shouted enthusiastically. Criticizing this way and pointing out that way, sometimes they nodded their fat pig-like heads together and stomped their feet and cheered in unison.</p>
<p>The father, holding the paper, was clearly overwhelmed with joy. This could be seen from his trembling hands and excited tone.</p>
<p>The strokes must be forceful, and you can't relax even a little bit. Ah, that's right...</p>
<p>He constantly winked at those people, smiling contentedly. The mother, standing to the side, also followed with a blank smile. The more pleased they were, the more resentment I felt, the more disappointed I felt, always hanging my head. It was fine at first, but later I felt my hands stiffen, my eyes blur, my waist ache, my feet cold, and my whole body convulsed as if trembling.</p>
<p>Look how little is biting her teeth, not even smiling once, she's really got some energy!</p>
<p>These teasing words made me completely unbearable. Perhaps to vent my anger, I suddenly decided not to write the couplet designated by my father, but instead used a couplet that I had thought of myself. At that time, my heart was beating extremely violently, as if all the blood vessels in my body were surging with a tide of anger.</p>
<p>"Red Gate—"</p>
<p>I quickly wrote these two words. The father quickly searched within the couplet he had designated, but there was no couplet that started like this, which made him anxious.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Ai Xianzhou's Test of Ten Thousand People Shows That the English Level of College Freshmen is Only Equivalent to American Junior High School Sophomores <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>For Educational Convenience, Universities and Middle Schools Should Not Use English Textbooks</p>
<p>The Education Experiment Institute of the Education College of Central University, entrusted by the China Education and Culture Foundation, conducted a survey to improve English teaching, presided over by Ai Xianzhou and Zhang Shiyi. Since receiving the commission, Ai has gone to famous universities and high schools in the north and south provinces twice, in May 21 and May of this year, to conduct tests. The students tested were nearly 10,000. Now that the preliminary statistical work has been completed and the problem of analysis and research is being addressed, various detailed tables and charts have been prepared in advance. They compare the English reading fluency and comprehension performance of university and high school (part) students, as well as comparisons with American students. The following lists the important facts shown in each table and their causes: 1. Inland universities (such as certain provincial universities) and normal colleges (such as a certain provincial women's normal college) have the worst results. The reasons seem to be due to inconvenient inland transportation and poor middle school teachers. Students of normal colleges come from normal schools, and the English in normal schools has long been listed as an elective course, so the level is fundamentally uneven. 2. In terms of the four types of universities: national, provincial, private, and church-run, the national ones are better than the provincial ones, and the church-run ones are better than the national ones. This is because church universities pay special attention to English. Private schools located in commercial ports also have not weak results. 3. The results measured this year are better than those measured two years ago. There are two reasons that can be inferred: one is that in the year of the September 18th Incident, students in various schools were often absent from class, so their results were worse; the other is that in the past two years, the Chinese middle school entrance examination system has been implemented. High school graduates with considerable English proficiency are not easy to get into universities. 4. Comparing the results obtained from the two tests with the results obtained from the same tests in American middle schools, the difference is very large. The best English comprehension and speed level of our university freshmen is only equivalent to that of American junior high school sophomores. Moreover, the test period was in May, while the test period in American middle schools was in November. Compared with the two, there is still doubt. Now Ai has sent a letter to Mr. Stone in the United States to investigate. If our college students study for a full year, and their average score is only equal to that of American students who have just entered the first year of junior high school, then the distance between the two will be even greater. Based on the conclusions derived from the above points, Ai believes that to improve the English level of our universities and middle schools, we should improve the English teachers. After all, the poor results of inland students and the poor teachers should bear major responsibility. However, the effect of this method is limited. After all, it is difficult for students to make progress by leaps and bounds. It can be predicted. Therefore, for the convenience of teaching, we should fundamentally advocate the translation of books, and middle schools should not use English textbooks, and many reference books should also use translated versions, because Chinese people read Chinese books more conveniently. It is hoped that those who run universities and middle schools across the country will pay attention to it. According to the Central University Education College's recent publication of the *Education Series* Volume 1, Issue 2, which publishes many research results of the Experiment Institute, the main points are explored as follows: The Mission of the Education Experiment Institute (Ai Wei), Several Attempts of Industrial Psychology Technology (Du Zuozhou), Mental Hygiene of Problem Children (Wu Nanxuan), The Needs and Training of Vocational Teachers (Zhong Daozan), John Muller's Special Nerve Ability Theory (Pan Shu), A Brief Account of the Chicago Education Survey (Xia Chengfeng), Comparative Research on Chinese and American Intelligence (Wang Shulin), The Development of Industrial Psychology in Various Countries (Xiao Xiaorong), Mr. Bartler and His Recent Works (Ai Wei), The Transformation of European Aesthetic Education Thoughts (Chen Zifo), Art of Rome (Li Jiazi), Application Problems in Elementary School Arithmetic (Zhao Tingwei), and Funding Issues for University Libraries (Gui Zhigen).</p>

From next year, the percentage of funding for normal, vocational, and ordinary middle schools can reach the number set by the Ministry. Yang talked about Qinghai's 15 counties, 10 counties with Han and Hui ethnic groups, and 5 counties with Mongolian and Tibetan populations of one million. The province's education funding is 90,000 yuan and the local funding is 230,000 yuan. There are three secondary schools, six normal schools, three vocational schools, seventy-two complete primary schools, and five hundred elementary schools. The Hainan Garrison Command in the provincial capital has an attached primary school. The children of Mongolian princes and Tibetan children come to the province to study, and their achievements are quite remarkable. Social education includes two provincial libraries, and each county also has small-scale libraries. Each county has ten or more people's schools.</p>

<p>Jiaxing Education Funds Cause Panic</p>
<p>The funds for primary and secondary schools in Jiaxing County are mainly derived from county taxes. However, due to the drought and disaster this year, the income from land taxes has decreased, resulting in a significant reduction in the educational funds derived from county tax revenue. Although the education authorities have tried their best to plan, all funds are designated for specific purposes and cannot be diverted for long. Therefore, the regular expenses issued to various schools cannot be met, and the accumulated arrears have reached six months. The principals of each school have repeatedly demanded the money, but there is no solution. The principals of each school believe that it is inappropriate for teachers to teach on empty stomachs, and they have recently requested the education authorities to find a way to maintain the situation. If there is no solution by November 16, they will stop teaching and seek other livelihoods. Therefore, the director of the Education Bureau is discussing with the administrative authorities to maintain education so that each teacher can concentrate on education.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Prepare for the Memorial Service for Li Shicen <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Professor Li Shicen of National Jinan University was a highly respected master of philosophy in China. Unfortunately, he died of illness in Jinan New Village the day before yesterday. The teachers and students of the school suddenly lost a good teacher and friend and have been in great grief for days. President Shen Pengfei recently appointed Zhang Yaoxiang, Guo Yicen, Lu Shaozhong, Xia Yande, Chen Ruzhou, Li Qirong, Zhou Guangzhong, and Yang Shusun to form the Preparatory Committee for Li's Memorial Service. The second meeting was held in the conference room at 4:00 pm that afternoon. All nine people attended, chaired by Zhang Yaoxiang and recorded by Xia Yande. The following duties were assigned: General Affairs: Zhang Yaoxiang and Chen Ruzhou; Communication: Li Qiluan and Li Xianshi; Documents: Yang Shusun and Zhou Guangzhong; Publication: Guo Yicen and Xia Yande; Affairs: Lu Shaozhong and Ni Xiusheng. It was decided to solicit many items and select a location to start work on a specific date. It is reported that a grand memorial service has been scheduled for November 9 (Friday) at 9:00 am in the school's Zhiyuan Hall. All institutions, schools, newspapers, organizations, Li's relatives and friends, and those who admire Li's academic and personality are welcome to attend. If you have any items to send, you can send them to the General Affairs Section of the University from now on. Li was well-versed in Chinese and Western learning during his lifetime, lectured in the north and south, had extensive social interactions, and his students were like clouds. His posthumous honor will be a grand occasion at that time. In terms of publication, in addition to the special issues published by various newspapers in Shanghai, the association is also preparing to publish a special issue of the *Education Magazine* and is starting to compile a large book, *Li's Commemorative Album*. His posthumous photos, posthumous works, posthumous records, and commemorative articles from all walks of life are being collected these days. They are also hoped to be sent to the association so that they can be included together. The deadline for collection is set for one month.</p>
<p>City Education Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e191">Allocates Funds to Treat Children with Tuberculosis <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Some Children Have Shown Improvement</p>
<p>The City Education Bureau pays great attention to weak children. Since Dr. Gao Jinglang was invited to hold a tuberculosis injection test last year, all those suffering from tuberculosis have been rescued in every possible way, despite the lack of funds. For example, in October of the 22nd year, Peter Elementary School held a tuberculosis injection test and divided the reactive children into four categories: (A), (B), (C), and (D). All disposal measures were published in the newspapers in January of this year. Now, the following explores the situation of children with tuberculosis receiving treatment in the second semester of the 22nd year: 1. Three children in category A were sent to the hospital for treatment. Except for one who is still hospitalized, the other two have been discharged from the hospital. 2. Children in category B are practicing half-day reading and half-day rest. The rest place is in the surplus room of Dehua Elementary School. Nurses from the South Shanghai Health Office are sent to the school every afternoon to take care of them. They also take cod liver oil every day and are sent to the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society for examination once a week. 3. In addition to taking cod liver oil every day, children in both categories are sent to the Red Cross Hospital for examination every four weeks. 4. Statistics at the end of the semester show that: 1. 180 people were examined for the first time, 2. 41 people were classified into category B, 3. 2 people in category B and 12 people in category C were unwilling to go to the hospital for treatment again, 4. A total of 125 people were treated in the hospital, including 7 entering category D, 61 progressing, 49 without progress, 5 more serious, and 3 questionable. At the beginning of the academic year, the school continued to hold treatment for children with tuberculosis. There are currently 54 children who should read for half a day and rest for half a day. Although most children can barely read all day, 8 of them and the 5 more serious ones in the statistics at the end of the school year must be given appropriate rest. The City Education Bureau allocates 50 yuan per month for the children's resting place, and will gradually improve hygiene facilities by setting up a bathroom.</p>

<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of education and culture, people of all countries harbor negative feelings towards Japan. The gunfire of September 18th and January 28th shocked the world. Countries referred to Japan as the second Germany, calling it an aggressive imperialist or a barbarian state. However, most people did not pay much attention to Japan's cultural situation. Therefore, in order to change the negative impression of Japan in various countries, Japan will fully demonstrate at this conference how noble and widespread Japanese culture is, how perfect Japanese schools are, and how great Japan's contribution to world academics is. Representatives from various countries will only see the advantages of Japan and will not see its disadvantages. As a result, the impression Japan leaves in the minds of the representatives will be transformed. Moreover, Japan can use the materials it has collected over the years, using oral, written, or film methods, to publicize China's anti-Japanese situation. They can use despicable means to embellish Japan's crimes with China's anti-Japanese books and slogans, stating that Japan's occupation of the Northeast was truly a last resort. In this way, they can hope to stir up the views of representatives from various countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Japan can guide the representatives to visit the development of Japanese production and the excellence of its products, so that the stagnant Japanese goods may have a chance to sell.</p>
<p>Finally, we can predict that in this World Education Conference, Japan will definitely strive to have representatives from the puppet state occupy a seat. At that time, the Japanese will perhaps resort to coercive tactics. This is of great importance to China. In any case, we can determine that the Chinese delegates will never agree to sit with the puppet state's representatives. If the conference is truly coerced by the Japanese and allows the puppet state's representatives to participate, then our country must strive strongly or decisively withdraw. We can imagine that the position of our country's representatives at this conference will be more difficult than at the Far Eastern Games. Therefore, our educational authorities must pay attention to the situation of this conference as soon as possible. (The End)</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: A Cup of Water Reveals Hardship, A Bureaucrat Protects the Elderly, Ten Thousand Gold Coins Discuss Mountains, A Cunning Official Imitates</p>
<p>Poor people, seeing rich people enjoying all kinds of benefits, always harbor resentment, thinking that since everyone is human, why do some suffer so much while others enjoy so much? However, once they have dealings with rich people, they are very willing to have a close relationship with them, hoping to get some help from them. In Hu's eyes, Cheng Zhiqian was always a top-class rich man. Because he went to Little Western Paradise every day, and always saw him associating with friends who rode in cars, that was clear evidence. Because in Xi'an city, there were no privately owned cars. Even the cars of merchants were those large trucks and long-distance buses. The sedan-style cars that came and went on the street were no more than a dozen or twenty, and those were all from the various government offices. So in Hu's eyes, all the people who rode in sedan cars on the street were "老爷 (Lǎoyé)" masters. This assumption of hers cannot be said to be wrong. And because Zhiqian was always with these people, naturally he was also a quasi-"老爷". Now that she had brought Zhiqian home, she very much wanted to establish a close relationship with him, to sell Yueying to him as a concubine. Unexpectedly, his first reply was that this was not the solution. Hu, in the backyard of Little Western Paradise, had secretly noticed that Zhiqian had sneaked several glances at Qieying, seemingly he also cherished this little girl, now that she had brought him home, could there be any change of heart? So she leaned against the yellow earthen wall, hooked her small feet, grabbed the copper ear pick on her bun, and kept scratching in her hair. Smiling, she asked: "老爷, we poor people have few ideas, do you have any other solutions?" (53)</p>
<h3 id="e211">Wang Renqiu's Discourse on Emotion <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Wang Renqiu had an interesting view on the issue of emotion. He said that love between two people is not limited by age. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei were hardly fond of the young; Empress Wu's "controlling cranes" was also as if she forgot her age. So he, at the age of eighty, was still fond of Zhou Ma. He also said; Li Changji said, "If heaven has emotions, heaven would age," but he did not know that emotion's aging is irrelevant. Emotion naturally arises from blood and qi, without blood and qi there is no emotion, and where can one see nature by exhausting emotion? The Song people mistakenly thought that nature and emotion were evil, but they did not know that good and evil are both emotion, and Dao is also emotion. Blood and qi are nature, and food and sex are walls, so fish see Xishi and dive deep, and Qiang Shi sees fish and wants to net and hook, each using their emotions. Peeping at walls is not allowed, and piles and scabies do not involve emotion. It is precisely a matter of course. Are literary men's jests really arguments? Empress Wu's controlling cranes is similar to Deng Tu's lust, but controlling cranes is not her match. This is Empress Wu's misfortune, she directly indulged her nature without using emotion. All in all, we know that Xunzi's theory of the evil nature of man is better than Mencius's theory of the good nature of man. Mencius only talked about habit. This theory is quite in line with the modern change of accepting the sacred. The Song Confucians only worked hard and spent ink on the two things of nature and heart, but never thought of an emotion. Confucius said that food and sex are nature, but Renqiu insisted that it is emotion, Renqiu wants to justify himself with this. However, there is inevitably some far-fetchedness. However, people now always combine the two words "性情 (xìngqíng)" nature and emotion into one conversation, then nature is emotion, and emotion is nature, one and two, two and one. The nature said by the Song Confucians can also be extended to the word emotion, and in this way, Renqiu's words have no place to refute.</p>
<p>Like the relationship between Qian Muzhai and Liu Rushi, Renqiu's theory of emotion can of course be used to prove it, so Liu Rushi said, "My hair is his face, my face is his hair." As for Renqiu saying: Empress Wu's controlling cranes is similar to Deng Tu's lust, it is indulging nature without using emotion. It seems to contradict itself, above it has already been said that he forgot his age, of course it is born from the word emotion. Song Yu peeping at the wall is of course unrequited love. But Pan Boyin once wrote in the ancient capital, "The one who peeks at the wall for three years shoots Tang: always the Yuguan (Jade Gate) is emotional," so what is unrequited love, a one-sided emotion, if not emotion?</p>
<p>Renqiu is a Han scholar, so he is opposed to the Song Confucians. The conclusion also leads to a debate on the good and evil of human nature, but he has developed a theory of emotion on Yang Yuhuan and Wu Zetian that other scholars would never have the courage and wit to do.</p>

<p>— Fufan</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to a hostel to visit my friend Mr. Liu from Xuzhou, and saw that he had a poem that said: "Tiger Mountain is full of treasures, wind and rain confuse Xuzhou." I asked him about it. Mr. Liu said: "South of my hometown city is a mountain called Tiger Mountain, with beautiful scenery and hidden marvels. Yang Yingquan wrote about it, a famous figure in the Qing Dynasty Qianlong period, who loved books and writing, and was famous in Jiangbei. He served as prefect of Jiangzhou for ten years, and all his income was used to buy antiques; soon he witnessed the filth of the Qing court, so he resigned and returned to seclusion. He carved the ink treasures he had collected over the decades into stone, and built them into surrounding walls, with covered corridors above to protect them from wind and rain; he also established a poetry society, alternating in singing and harmonizing. For a time, Tiger Mountain became a gathering place for Jiangzhe literati. The ancient sites of the wall consist of the Eight Views of Pengcheng, Su Dongpo's Before and After Chibi Rhapsody, Mi Nan Gong's writings, Song Yue's Before and After Master's Table, and Zhu Yuanzhang, Dong Qichang, Zhu Xi, Deng Wenyuan, Tang Yin, Huang Tingjian, and Wang Xianzhi's inscriptions, prefaces, lyrics, and rhapsodies, totaling more than a hundred kinds, which are treasures of the world. A certain greedy official in the Qing Dynasty learned that Yang had these rare treasures hidden, and once sent someone to say that these antiques must be returned to the Great Interior. Yang bribed the visitor with a large sum of money, saying that the antiques were fake, and only then was he spared. Later, when the Red Sheep Rebellion arose, Xuzhou bore the brunt, and flames of war spread everywhere. The ancient precious steles were buried in weeds and desolate smoke, and the wind and rain eroded them, which is very regrettable." Mr. Liu then took out more than a hundred kinds of rubbings from his leather box for me to see. I felt that they were dazzling, antique, elegant, majestic, and complete, truly a thousand-year-old wonder!</p>

<h3 id="e215">Records of Incense Vaguely Heard <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In fact, we also understand very well that prohibitions are always observed only on the surface; secretly, I don't know how many thousands of eyes are hiding in suitable places, boldly, not hesitating to test the law!</p>
<p>Finally, we arrived in front of the palace: the entire team stopped outside the official gate. Once here, we inevitably had to pick one of the prescribed rituals to perform. First, we must not let the Empress Dowager walk in alone coldly: because in the Qing Palace, there is a very stubborn habit - in fact, all the habits in the palace are simply stubborn without exception - whenever the Emperor or Empress Dowager deigns to visit a place that is not often visited, someone must first line up and kneel to greet them inside before it can be considered dignified. This is the situation now. So that chief eunuch Li Lianying became greatly flustered: whenever it was time to perform a ritual, we couldn't help but ask him to be the director, and naturally he was indispensable at this moment. He first gave a wink to the sixteen young eunuchs carrying the Empress Dowager's phoenix palanquin, and they knew it, immediately stopped moving forward, and stood upright in the center of the imperial road, so that the Empress Dowager's face was exactly facing the largest door in the middle of the three-affiliated palace gates.</p>
<p>These sixteen eunuchs stood like sixteen stone statues, shouldering the Empress Dowager's phoenix palanquin, motionless: because this phoenix palanquin must absolutely not be allowed to touch the soil, otherwise, in ordinary people's official sedan chairs, when the owner sits upright inside waiting for something, the sedan chair carriers can temporarily unload the burden on their shoulders, let the sedan chair stop on the road, and the owner is generally very comfortable, and they are much less tired. However, this kind of blessing is not something that the sixteen young eunuchs carrying the Empress Dowager's phoenix palanquin dare to imagine: at this time, not only can they not put the palanquin down on their shoulders to rest, but they don't even dare to pant loudly!

<h3 id="e216">Various Calls <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Pavilion Master</p>
<p>The various calls mentioned here are the various terms of address. Terms of address in our China are diverse and endless. Now, I might as well write down what I know for you to see.</p>
<p>For example: Grandfather, some places call him "爹爹 (diēdiē)"; some places call him "爷爷 (yéyé)"; and some places call him "公公 (gōnggōng)".</p>
<p>For example: Grandmother, some places call her "娘姆 (niángmǔ)"; some places call her "娘娘 (niángniáng)"; and some places call her "奶奶 (nǎinai)".</p>
<p>For example: Father, some places call him "爷 (yé)"; or "爷爷 (yéyé)": some places call him "爹 (diē)"; or "爹爹 (diēdiē)": and some places call him "伯 (bó)"; or "阿伯 (ābó)"; and some places call him "爸爸 (bàba)"; or "伯爷 (bóyé)".</p>
<p>For example; Mother, some places call her "姆妈 (mǔma)"; some places call her "妈妈 (māma)"; and some places call her "娘 (niáng)"; and some places call her "阿妈 (āmā)".</p>
<p>Okay, okay, just this point alone, the various calls, I think it is enough to make the readers dizzy! If we were to write out all the various dialects and local languages of the provinces and counties (in fact, there are many local words that cannot be written), this publication would certainly not have such a large space to accommodate them, and even the readers would have a headache from it! Alas! All in all, the complexity of Chinese dialects can be imagined simply by looking at the various calls listed above! Then what's so strange about some people wanting to use English to replace the various dialects and local languages of the provinces and counties to communicate? Alas! From this point of view, unifying language and promoting the national language are really urgent matters!</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3 id="e217">Pomelos and Chestnuts <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>(I) Pomelos</p>
<p>Among autumn fruits, the largest are pomelos. The tree is a perennial evergreen shrub, produced in Fujian and Guangdong. The trunk is over ten feet tall, with thorns on the branches. The leaves are long and oval, and the petioles have small, membranous appendages. The fruit is four or five inches in diameter, round, and light yellow. The skin is very thick and difficult to peel. There are many varieties; those with white flesh and a sweet taste were anciently called "aromatic medicine." Some say: the ones with light red flesh inside the skin are called "aromatic luan," and those with white flesh and light crimson are called "zhuluan." Pomelos from Zhangzhou are the most famous. The Zhangzhou Prefectural Records state: "The best persimmons are called pomelos, produced in Changtai County, with a white color and a clear, fragrant taste, pleasing in their elegance. Only those grown in Xidong are superior. Not much is grown in that area, and they are not as good when transplanted elsewhere." Additionally, the Shatianyous from Rong County, Guangxi, are especially famous throughout the country. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, sour pomelos are called "pao," while in Fujian, all pomelos are called "pao," also written as "pao." Those produced in Siam are smaller in shape and darker in color, seemingly unworthy, but the juice is dense, sweet, and fragrant, making them of the highest quality. As the ancients said, "Judging a person by appearances can lose you a great scholar," which is especially true in this case.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring, with round, white stamens like large pearls. When they open, they resemble camellias, with a very clear fragrance, similar to jasmine. Foreigners pick them to steam for fragrance, with a superior flavor. See Fan Chengda's "Gui Hai Chu Heng Zhi."</p>
<p>When choosing pomelos, those with a high top and fine lines are best; those that are flat and round with coarse lines are sure to be sour. If the peel is intact when peeled, it can be dried in the sun, and its shape resembles a bowl, which can be used to store things. In the past, it was an essential item for old people who smoked dry tobacco. Pomelos have seeds inside. When soaked in water, they become exceptionally sticky, and women used them to apply to snow creams, but its uses are not as ubiquitous as the ephemerality of udumbara flowers.</p>
<p>There's an interesting anecdote about pomelos. I recall one year when I wrote a New Year's Day article for a certain publication, but the printer mistakenly printed "New Year's Day" as "pomelo." The next day, the editor, Mr. Wu, sent me a note saying: "I gave you New Year's Day, and you returned a pomelo. It's not a reward, but a punchline." Quoting from an opera, it was quite amusing.</p>
<p>Senior Wang Xishen once wrote a small treatise on aromatic luan, saying: "Its fragrance grows stronger as it travels further. Quietly facing it in a bright window is like being in a fragrant orchid pavilion, like meeting ancient poets. Its taste is like a sip of fine wine, not needing to be awakened by strong wine, it naturally intoxicates with its mellow aroma. There are many famous products among the fruits and vegetables of China, but if you want to seek one with profound depth, you must promote this 'gentleman' as a great fruit. Even those rare flowers, jade herbs, and fresh fruits that come from distant sea voyages often excel in being plump and heavy, but none can compare with this one." With such praise, the pomelo is undoubtedly worthy of it.</p>
<p>(II) Chestnuts</p>
<p>Among fruits, chestnuts are originally a top choice. Lu Qiong listed them alongside jujubes and hazelnuts, and traveling with water caltrop and gorgon fruit. They belong to deciduous trees, with trunks four or five zhang tall. The leaves are like simple blades. They bloom in early summer, and after the flowers fall, they are collected and burned; they do not extinguish even in wind and rain. The fruit has a large, spiky burr like a hedgehog. They ripen after the frost falls. The outer shell is hard, dark purple, and contains one, two, or three or four nuts inside, with pale red kernels that are edible. There are also those with one small fruit per burr, which are the original species of chestnut, called "lie." Their fruit is called "zhuli," mistakenly written as "maoli," commonly called "acorn."</p>
<p>Osmanthus chestnuts are produced on the shores of West Lake in Hangzhou, in Manjuelong. Chewing them naturally imparts the fragrance of osmanthus chestnuts, as the area is full of osmanthus, and the flowers' fragrance permeates them. There are also such things in the countryside of Liangxi, with a fragrance no less than those produced in Manjuelong, but their name is not as well-known.</p>
<p>The method of planting chestnuts is to bury the seeds in moist soil in late winter or early spring, planting them in a sunny place. Wait for them to grow several feet before transplanting them. At the vernal equinox, graft them onto oak trees or the most robust of the chestnut trees themselves. They are afraid of the cold, so wrap them in straw in early winter and remove it in the second month.</p>
<p>Some chestnuts are extremely large. The "Book of Later Han, Biography of Ma Han" states: "Ma Han produces large chestnuts like pears." Lu You jokingly wrote: "Frost chestnuts as big as fists." The "Poetry Meaning Notes" states: "Guiyang has clusters of chestnuts, as big as persimmons." Zheng Zhong's Records state: "Zhengzhong produces giant chestnuts, saying that their shells can be used as cups." As for the "Shen Yi Jing" which says: "In the eastern wilderness, there is a tree named 'eye chestnut,' whose shell is three feet and three inches in diameter, with thorns over ten feet long, and the fruit is three feet in diameter," it is absurd and unreasonable and cannot be believed.</p>
<p>The ancients wrote many famous lines about chestnuts, such as Geng Xin saying: "Autumn forests have fatter chestnuts." Fang Hui said: "All yellow, new chestnuts are tender." Du Fu said: "Mountain homes steam chestnuts warm." Fat, tender, warm—these capture the essence of chestnuts, which only a seasoned foodie would know.</p>
<p>Chestnuts are best cooked with candy or stir-fried with sand, which makes them sweeter and more palatable. Recently, some have used machines, without manual labor, to stir-fry them with honey, making them even more exquisite.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Slight Changes in Gold, Silver and Tax Collection Methods; Bidding for Gold Remains Strong <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a slight reduction in silver tax, a stable previous market, a surprisingly tight exchange market, and a renewed sense of prosperity. A surge in prices was anticipated. Initially, overseas silver markets in Britain and the United States both contracted, with far-term silver markets experiencing even greater declines and exchange rates shrinking. London spot gold also rose by 1.5 pence, improving sentiment. Off-market pre-trading opened, immediately rising to 85.6 yuan. However, news reported that Minister Kong had ordered that the balance tax on silver exports should be paid according to the customs declaration date, and that additional miscellaneous taxes should be waived. This caused large investors to waver, and a surge in supply led to a pullback. However, the aforementioned factors had largely passed. This newspaper had mentioned as early as last Saturday that sentiment was stable, with much sideways movement. The opening was flat. The Central Bank's announcement of rates showed Britain and the United States flat, and customs gold up 2%. The standard gold price was increased to 993.3 yuan, and even though it was slightly pulled up, large investors still had a selling appetite. Chinese merchants lacked a buying appetite due to the slightly loosened silver tax and the seeming lack of shortage of exchange bills. The domestic market hardened and retreated into the 80 yuan range. However, public sentiment did not weaken, and after falling, buying activity was strong, gradually pushing prices higher. HSBC Bank's British and American quotes remained unchanged, while Sassoon declined in the face of heavy selling, but interbank trading was active, allowing prices to be maintained. The Central Bank's acquisition of short-term exchange bills stabilized sentiment, and market prices rebounded. However, the Central Bank's balance tax retreated to 8%, which was 2.5% lower than before. The rise and fall had no major impact, mainly because the overseas silver market was declining, and the silver tax should naturally be slightly lower. Buyers were still willing to be active, and the overall trend was stable and mediocre. Although prices rose later, there was much sideways movement, and the situation was very uncertain. The outlook was promising, and the opening was firm. Banks also actively bid, while Chinese merchants sold with little enthusiasm. As a result, the domestic market was surprisingly tight, and the gold market was filled with buying. Bombay was also slightly lower. Although there was sideways movement in the middle, there was a lack of sellers, and the market was bullish, fluctuating and rising. It then broke through the 90 yuan mark before stabilizing slightly. Some supply was available at high prices, leading to a slight pullback. In the end, the price remained contested around 90 yuan due to the closing price relationship. The daily market was weak and then strong, with silver prices continuously declining. The current trend is unlikely to rise. Therefore, although the silver tax has been eased, the exchange market has tightened, sentiment is surprisingly bullish, short positions seem to be wavering, and the overall trend is returning to prosperity. A record of the day's market is as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 982.8 yuan, slightly higher than the previous closing by 0.2 yuan. Fuchang Hengyu advanced to 3.8 yuan, but fell to 79 yuan due to aggressive selling from Dade, Qianchang, Xiangding, Changyifeng, and Yong. Fu, Yu, Yongda, Fuyong, Chang Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongqian, and Changxiang took advantage of the low prices to gradually rise to 83.7 yuan. It was learned that HSBC Bank's British and American quotes had not changed, slightly impacting sentiment. Yuanyi Dafayong Bingxing sold off, and HSBC was willing to cover spot US dollars at 31.25, falling to 0.06 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongfu, Xingyong, Richang, and Yicheng actively bought, gradually rising to 4.8 yuan. News that the balance tax had been reduced to 8%, lower than before by 2.5%, led Tianfeng Dingkang to sell aggressively at high prices, falling to 1.2 yuan. However, this news only affected large investors. Fu, Yu, Yongfu, Hengchu, etc., continued to advance to 3.8 yuan. Dafa Yongqing Yu sold, falling to 2.5 yuan. At this time, Yuanchang Yongheng Chu Natao still had room to rise. When Shunmao sold aggressively, it retreated to 1.8 yuan. Yuanmao Yongheng Xing Hengyu entered, but the transactions were limited, gradually rising to 4 yuan. After this, Fuxing Yong, etc., bought and sold, with retail investors still on the buying side. The gold market rebounded from 2.8 yuan to 4.1 yuan. After sideways movement, the noon closing was 983.7 yuan. At the close, Hengyu was still covered, and the situation was stable.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 4984.5 yuan, and Huixiang Yongli Hengyu advanced to 5.1 yuan. Fu and Yong Futai Hengzhao Cao Changyicheng sold to 3.7 yuan. Citibank made a bid for November shillings at 125, and Hengyu Zhaofeng Changchun Yuan Yongsheng Dafuxing Yongrichang Hengchang Yong, etc., all entered. Mitsui bidded for January US dollars at 25, and Bombay was lower, rising to 7 yuan. Dingkang Fuxing Yongshunmao sold, falling to 5.2 yuan. Citibank Zhengjin Mai Jiali Shanghai bidded for February US dollars at 25 and remained stable. Wanxing Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang Tianfeng etc. entered, rising to 9.2 yuan. Zhejiang was willing to offer January US dollars at 125, and Bombay returned to Daya Na Gangyishen Kang Yuanmao Yong took the opportunity to supply, retreating to 7.6 yuan. Mitsui bidded for November shillings at 0.625, and Hengyu Fuyu Zhentai Yicheng Dalianbang entered, breaking through 90 yuan, rising to 90.8 yuan. Dade Cheng Fuxing Yong Tianfeng sold to 89.7 yuan, Hengyu Hengchang Yongqing Yu advanced to 91 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yong Fuyu took the opportunity to sell, suddenly retreating to 88.8 yuan. Yongli Qian Changxiang Hengtai Hongxing etc. entered, rebounding to 90.5 yuan. Qingfa Yong and others supplied. At this time, both short and long sides struggled, oscillating around 90 yuan. The follow-up closing price was 990.1 yuan. After the close, Yuanmao Yong Fuxing Yong etc. slightly covered, finally rising to 1 yuan outside. The highest price of the day was 991 yuan, and the lowest price was 979 yuan, a fluctuation of 12 yuan. The result was that it rose again by 7.5 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, was increased to 993.3 yuan, which was about 3 yuan according to the closing price, a decrease of 7 yuan from the previous closing. The old standard for November, with HSBC Bank's US exchange rate unchanged, was still 32.5625, corresponding to a gold price of over 1062 yuan. November's accounting was 986 yuan, December's was 984 yuan, morning water replenishment was 986 yuan, afternoon water replenishment was 992 yuan, and the price of red gold was 992.8 yuan. There were no formal transactions in the market. The approximate buying price was increased by 11.5 yuan. This was because Tianjin goods also lacked transactions on schedule, and the situation was roughly flat. In addition, spot goods continued to arrive at the port, and each spot number was prepared to release public orders. Also, due to the date relationship, there were occasional discount interest rates, and many people were代解公單. There were 8,064 November notes remaining, with a total of 13 long positions and 12 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In summary, Fuxing Yong Tongchun Dafa Yong Dade Cheng Yufa Yongheng Team Yuli Hongxing Dingkang Futai Hengxiang He Qian Changxiang Richang Shengda etc. were on the buying side, while Shunmao Yifeng Yongli Fengshen Kang Houchang Yongqing Yu Hengxing Fuyu Yuanmao Yong Tianfeng Bingxing etc. were on the selling side. Dingchang Dingkang Qian Changxiang Hengtai Yongli Yongde first sold and then entered, Zhaofeng Changxin 錩 Yuan Chun Yicheng first advanced and then exited, Dalianbang Wanxing jointly made over 1,200 notes, and rolled over and advanced. Shunli jointly made less than 600, rolled over and slightly exited. Guangbang Hengxing slightly sold, Shengda advanced about 200 notes, and exited about 100. The number of December futures was 35,140, with a total of 60 long positions and 53 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 25,074 notes in the morning and 23,256 notes in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Central Bank and Banking Sector with Strong Buying Appetite</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London big orders for both near and far term contracted by 125, US silver contracted by 125, and although silver futures fell by 70 to 90 pounds, only two contracts were traded. London spot gold rose by 1.5 pence. The British exchange rate against the US dollar rose by 375, and the US dollar against the British pound contracted by 125. There was no change against the French franc, and the US dollar against the French franc decreased by 25.

After the opening, the Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the British and US rates unchanged, but customs gold rose by another 2%. Interbank trading had loosened. Chinese merchants, due to the slightly revised silver tax and the anticipated easing of exchange bills, lacked a buying appetite. HSBC Bank's listed prices were unchanged for both British and US rates. Although the process was loose thereafter, there were no major changes. Sassoon provided shillings, and the banks also sold US dollars slightly, but the Central Bank acquired near-term bills. The overall trend in the morning was mediocre. In the afternoon, the banks' buying intention was enthusiastic, and the decline in Indian silver led to tightening. However, Chinese merchants were still selling. Indian silver rebounded by one Ana, and there was slight contention. However, the closing was still extremely tight. The closing selling price for the near-term British exchange rate was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and the US exchange rate was 33.1875, which was tighter by 0.125 and 0.1875 compared to the previous closing. The Central Bank and other banks had a strong buying appetite. Although Sassoon and Chinese merchants had supply, their selling intention was not strong. Chinese merchants sold about 300,000 US dollars and a small number of shillings. The transactions are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>End of the Tenth Period</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Collection and Settlement Cumbersome</p>
<p>Yesterday, October 30, was the day before the end of the tenth period. All long-term collections and settlements for the fourth period had to be completed on this day and today's end period, so the situation was extremely complicated and cumbersome. However, the market was sluggish this time, so there was far less of this long-term collection and settlement than in the previous period. But it was still busier than a normal month-end. The interbank interest rate in the market was six cents in both the morning and afternoon. Headlining was added from two to three cents up to seven to eight cents. Although the headline was not short, the imbalance of long and short positions led to a slight crush. The trading of settlement bills was over 3.1 million in the morning and over 500,000 in the afternoon. The trading in the small general association was over 300,000. The trading of dollar mortgages was also considerable this time, with long-term mortgages and loans. Therefore, the number of redemptions was small each day, and there were many mortgages made. Yesterday, there was another 1.4 million to 1.5 million. Banknotes were collected back over 900,000, and over 1.4 million were issued. The customer's source was 300,000, and the outflow was over 400,000. Over 1.4 million were issued. The customer's source was 300,000, and the outflow was over 400,000. Bank collections and settlements were very crowded yesterday. Foreign banks collected and settled over 3.34 million in bills, collected and settled over 6.23 million in various goods, foreign exchange mortgages and miscellaneous loans, settled over 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlement, collected and settled over 1.7 million in settlements, over 1.2 million in special foreign exchange, and 900,000 out of storage.

<p>The internal market quotation for long-term deposit interest for this period was determined at five yuan by a public resolution of the Qianye Committee the day before yesterday, which is about half a yuan lower than the market price of 5.5 yuan in the previous period (4th day). However, the amount of deposits was more than 10 million more than in the previous period, indicating that cash is concentrated and cannot circulate, which is a glimpse of the social predicament.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Good Market Sentiment in the Securities and Bond Market <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, futures for December began trading, and the atmosphere was lively. After the opening, most of the bids were all executed, and trading in the market was quite lively. Because of the good news from Beiping, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is about to return south from the Xiehe Hospital, and Wang Chonghui has a second trip to the Southwest, and there is an urgent hope for a grand unification. Retail investors bought a lot, but numbers 48 and 77 were sold a lot, so the rise was weak and could not continue. The current situation is still brewing. The progress yesterday was that in the morning, there were sporadic entrances but many households, and there were many exits but few households. The retail investors still had the advantage, and the market price rose uniformly, with a sharp increase of six cents. However, numbers 48 and 77, etc., were sold in the market, so people's hearts were a little discouraged. Although the front row continued to be slightly better by two or three cents in the next set, it loosened up from the 20th level, and number 77 was still sold a lot, so it was slightly lower by one or two cents. Trading decreased slightly in the afternoon, and the opening entrance and exit were sluggish, and the market price was chaotic. The high and low were mutually seen one or two cents. At the close, the entrances were satisfied, and it fell slightly by about one cent. As a result, the market price rose by about two cents to half a yuan. The total turnover was 14.73 million yuan, with 8,000 shares of stock. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>
<h3 id="e223">Process of Yarn and Cotton Futures Delivery <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>6,400 Bales of Yarn at a Price of 178 Yuan</p>
<p>10,500 Loads of Cotton at a Price of 35.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The October period standard yarn was auctioned on the morning of May 1 this year. The price of the first lot was 174.1 yuan, which fell to 3.7 yuan. The factories, due to high cotton prices and sluggish yarn markets, reduced production in order to maintain survival. Before long, in the North China area, the price of Japanese coarse yarn was higher than that of Chinese yarn, and Tianjin and other places came to Shanghai to purchase Chinese yarn in large quantities. Therefore, people's hearts were greatly excited, and the market gradually turned around, resulting in a reduction in inventory and the market price rising from this point. Later, in mid-June and July, the weather was extremely dry, and cotton prices tended to rise. At the same time, there was a sharp rise in wheat and flour, and the financial community made huge profits. The standard yarn was also purchased in large quantities, and the standard highest price was once seen at 188.8 yuan. However, due to the high price and slow sales, rampant banditry in Sichuan, a remittance of 1,500 yuan, strange growth in silver prices, falling gold prices, and low-priced calculations of three-product yarn, the Japanese dumped a lot of money, and the pressure was particularly heavy. And there were old yarns arriving, and the recipients were lacking, and the market suddenly turned down, breaking from 80 yuan to the 170 yuan mark, and the lowest was once seen at 168.5 yuan. Until October 15, the National Government increased the export tax on silver and added a balance tax, and the foreign exchange shrank strangely, and the gold price soared, and the prices soared. On the 18th, the standard yarn had a momentary frenzy, and the highest price was seen at 183.9 yuan. Before long, the gold price fell back, and the market slackened, falling again to 175 yuan. As a result, the remaining 6,400 bales were delivered at a price of 178 yuan, including 400 bales of Fuguis and 400 bales of Qiuhe for new goods, and the rest were old goods. The brokers and numbers of the receiving and delivering parties are listed below.</p>
<p>The October period standard cotton was auctioned at the opening of the market on May 1 this year. The price of the first lot was 32.65 yuan. At this time, the psychology of most people was that the arable land had greatly increased this year, because the rice price was too cheap last year, and farmers had mostly switched to planting cotton trees, which had thicker harvests, so the throwers were quite turbulent, but slightly fell to 2.35 yuan. Before long, Chenhua 6, 7, and the Dan period were thin on the bottom, and the foreign cotton was stable, and speculators absorbed a lot, and later the American drought and the reduction of arable land under the Peng Haide Act, and the domestic climate was dry, and the drought was severe, and the development of cotton was greatly damaged. , the market price rose from 33 yuan to 36.7 yuan, and the highest was once reached 37.35 yuan. It was spied that the government report on August 8 was beneficial to the long, but the domestic yarn sales were not smooth, and there were large sales by large households, and the parcel amount was more than 100,000 loads. The market was suppressed by it. On October 15, the China Cotton Production Improvement Association reported that the acreage had increased, and although the drought was severe, the output was still 1 to 2 million loads higher than the previous year. The heart turned soft again, and the lowest was still 33.55 yuan. Until October 15, after the National Government increased the export tax on silver and added a balance tax, the cotton market jumped wildly, and the highest was once seen at 37.1 yuan. Although the delivery in the late month was not strong, and then the recipients were lacking, and it fell to 35.1 yuan. As a result, the remaining 10,500 loads, and the delivery price was written 35.5 yuan. The goods included Huoji Yaohua Hankou crude velvet Shaanxi Hua Shashi Hua, totaling two or three thousand loads, and the rest were delivered by themselves. The numbers and amounts of the brokers on both the receiving and delivering sides are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Calm on Delivery Day in Spot Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the sales of spot yarn are less than before, but the selling price is still firm, because the factory's inventory is drawn down a lot, causing people's hearts to rise. And the financial community is in the long position, but the situation in the fourth regiment is still flat, and drastic changes are difficult to find for the time being. According to the statistics of the sales of spot yarn by each gang throughout the day, 281 bales were sold, and the market was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows: 100 bales in the mainland, Nianbao in Ningbo, 105 bales in Guangdong, 10 bales in Changsha, Nian 6 bales in Fujian, 15 bales in Jiangxi, and 5 bales in Xiamen.</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat, because the situation of American cotton is very weak, causing people's hearts to be discouraged, but Indian cotton is still rising, the exchange rate is still stable, and the hope of increasing the source of each road is gradually increasing. The sources include 1,180 bales of Yaohua, 992 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<p>Huojihua 39.25 Yufeng Factory entered 300 bales Spot goods delivered to factory</p>
<h3 id="e225">US Cotton Stagnant Sales, Market Sentiment Difficult to Revive <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>US cotton price fluctuations are small, requiring a slow pace. There was quite a bit of short selling at the opening, but a Liverpool telegram indicated strength, and the overseas market was firm, so prices rose slightly. Afterwards, the overseas market closed, so the local market gradually became calm. In addition, Chicago was weak, and prices fell back. The closing sentiment was still stable. The Cotton Exchange today (29th) released its estimate of worldwide US cotton consumption for September of this year as 848,000 bales, a decrease of 347,000 bales compared to 1,195,000 bales in September of last year. The spot price fell 5 British pounds per ton, and the futures price fell 1 to 8 British pounds per ton. British cotton futures fell 3 points. Indian cotton rose due to good news from Liverpool and bullish speculation, with Pingguo rising 7.5 annas, Olapu rising 2 rupees, and Baiji stagnant at 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 29th).</p>
<h3 id="e226">Grain Spot Prices of Foreign Wheat are Decreasing, Futures Prices of Flour and Wheat are Gradually Declining <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month continued to show a weakening trend. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell 34 cents in the near term and 90 cents in the long term, while Canada fell about 20 cents. When the opening price was quoted, market sentiment was uneasy due to changes in foreign wheat prices. The opening price for this month was as low as 40.05 cents, a significant drop of 8 cents compared to the previous day's opening price. The prices for the long-term months also dropped by 23 cents. However, after the second round of trading, some shorts covered their positions for profit, and some outsiders also competed to buy, so the market rebounded, rising by 34 cents compared to the opening price. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices fell across the board. The spot price of foreign wheat was even lower. A vessel was indeed traded at 4.96 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday only 4.70 yuan was offered. Factories were only willing to pay 4.85 yuan. With this news in the market, selling pressure naturally increased, and prices gradually declined. The eager sale of foreign wheat and the determination of factories to purchase it are obstacles to the market's future. As a result, the price for this month fell 1.5 cents, November fell 1.75 cents, December fell 1.25 cents, January-February fell 2.25 cents, and March fell 2.5 cents.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for each month fluctuated in a flat and weak manner. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell slightly, from 34 cents to 90 cents, while Canada fell slightly, about 20 cents. The morning sessions had a slight impact on near-term prices, with a small increase of 34 cents, while long-term prices remained flat. In the afternoon sessions, near-term prices were relatively stable due to purchases by outsiders, while long-term buying interest was weak. Although there were few large-scale sell-offs in the market due to the loosening of spot foreign wheat, sentiment remained uneasy. Therefore, the overall outcome was weak and lackluster. If foreign wheat continues to be contracted or included in the standard, changes in the future are inevitable. As a result, the prices for November and December remained unchanged, January increased by 0.2 cents, and February increased by 0.4 cents. The spot wheat market was generally stable, with Wuhe wheat opening at 3.86 yuan, and Suzhou, Shandong, Bengbu, and Jiangbei wheat opening at 3.84 yuan, totaling 40,000 bags, reportedly handled by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<p>After the Canadian Government Restricted Grain Speculation</p>
<h3 id="e227">Chicago Wheat Prices Plunge by More Than Two Cents <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>After several meetings between the head of wheat, McFarland, and the Canadian Prime Minister, it was announced today (29th) in Chicago that the Canadian government had decided to restrict speculation in grain trading in Winnipeg. However, the nature of the restrictions has not yet been clarified, causing panic selling in the market. Market sentiment in various places was affected. The Chicago market was in a state of confusion. Various pieces of positive news, such as reduced warehouse inventories and a deteriorating situation in Argentina with concerns about crop rot, were ignored. Prices plummeted by more than two cents. The domestic situation remains favorable for the bulls. It is generally believed that the possibility of rising prices here depends entirely on the progress of the overseas market.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Increased Sales of Foreign Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Ke Xian Rice Continues to Rise by One Dime... New Arrivals of Foreign Rice Fall in the Morning, Rise in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign Ke Xian rice was brisk in both arrivals and sales, with excellent market sentiment. Ke Xian rice continued to arrive from Hunan and Hubei, and Guangdong machine-processed rice also continued to arrive. However, the sales of local Ke Xian rice were even more eager, with arrivals being immediately sold out. There were no inventories in the market, so prices gradually increased. Yesterday, 7,600 bags of various Sha City broken and unpolished rice, 2,000 bags of various Hunan machine-processed unpolished rice, 200 bags of Cantonese rice, and 20 bags of Hankou new unpolished rice were sold, mostly handled by the interior. The local market also had a strong appetite, and the selling prices of various types of rice were all more than one and a half dimes higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>In addition to inquiries about Ke Xian rice, the local market had an even greater interest in foreign rice. However, market sentiment for foreign rice weakened in the morning, continuing the previous day's weakness. Sentiment had softened, and foreign firms were eager to sell new orders. A new vessel with new orders had arrived, containing 340,000 bags of Saigon rice, imported by the Huilai Fuma La. The current Saigon rice price was slightly more than one dime lower, but after the price decreased, the local market suddenly developed a strong appetite, and buying intentions became even stronger in the afternoon. Prices gradually rebounded, rising by more than one and a half dimes, exceeding the previous day by four or five cents. More than 10,000 bags of Saigon rice and 2300 bags of Annam broken rice were traded. Annam large rice reached 11 yuan, Saigon large rice reached 10.75 yuan, and Saigon futures prices also rebounded. 800 tons for March, and 200 tons each for October and November, were sold, all handled by the local market.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Thick and Thin Geng Rice Rise by Two Dimes <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Supplies from various groups are particularly scarce, totaling only about 20-odd stores (about 3,000 dan of goods). Initial market sentiment was particularly enthusiastic, with brisk sales. Sellers' bids were increasing, and the situation at that time was unusually attractive. Later, shipments of six types of packages from Qingdao and Yantai and other groups, totaling 800-odd packages, arrived, and the market suddenly rose. As a result, the price of new thin rice such as Kiln Type 6 increased by two dimes, and thick new Geng rice such as Wild Rice and White Rice also showed the same positive trend. Duyang pointed rice also showed strength. The price of Bian Yin Yuan rose by one or two dimes due to the movement of liquor merchants.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 23-24 stores from the various central towns along the river arrived. Various types of sales were brisk in the market. New Geng rice, Broken Geng rice, New Yangjian rice, New Dujian pointed rice, Honey rice, and Zero rice continued to be sold. Chen Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan rice became dull. Trading in New and Old Bu Ke pointed rice was also brisk. Market sentiment: New Geng rice with high quality increased by 4 cents, medium quality increased by about 2 dimes, Broken Geng rice increased by 4 cents, New Dujian pointed rice and Yangjian pointed rice increased by one dime, and Honey Fruit rice prices were stable. New and Old Bu Ke pointed rice prices increased by about 1 dime. Chen Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan rice prices were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Yellow Bean Sales Are Quite Active <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment for both new and old yellow beans turned to stability. The reason is that both domestic and export routes were active. Exports went to Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo, while domestic sales went to local factories. In addition, Dalian also reported an increase, so the market was filled with optimism. It is estimated that a total of 16-17 carloads of various beans were traded in the market yesterday, and prices were slightly tighter, up by 2-3 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Sugar Market, Wufu White Crystal Has Continued to Arrive <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned stable as the customs gold slightly increased. The guild's quoted price for 24 coarse sand white ordinary spot goods was 18.8 yuan, but no transactions were made. Goods from this store were priced at 18.9 yuan, and some transactions were made. Transshipment goods were priced at 5.6 yuan, with little fluctuation. 89 Holland red sugar was priced at 14.2 yuan. Transshipment goods were quoted at 5.2 yuan the day before yesterday but failed to sell. Yesterday, they were quoted at 5.1 yuan, a decrease of 5 cents compared to the previous day (27th). Zhenyu No. 1 cotton white sugar from this factory was priced at 17.3 yuan, and No. 2 was priced at 17.1 yuan, temporarily looking stable. More than 200 boxes of Beihai sliced blue sugar were offered at a price of 10.35 yuan, a decrease of 5 cents compared to the previous day. Dozens of bags of Leizhou secondary white sugar were offered at a price of 16 yuan. Xinghua red oil bags were still offered at 12 yuan. The previous shipment of standard Wufu white crystal had already been sold out and had been out of stock for many days. It was learned yesterday that the company has received another 200 boxes, which are still being declared at customs. A small amount of lower-grade Leizhou red sugar has been offered at a price of 10 yuan.</p>

<p>Longkou Vermicelli and Dried Noodles, due to previous rolling shortages, have risen by 34 yuan in the Shanghai market and are now out of stock. According to information from the production area, new goods cannot be loaded temporarily in recent days. They can probably be loaded at the end of the month, so they will definitely arrive in Shanghai next week. It is predicted that the market price for new vermicelli will be around 21 yuan, which is cheaper than old goods.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Aviation Competition Fever <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>It is said that this time, taking advantage of Australia's centenary, Britain held the greatest aviation competition in history: a grand event with twenty aircraft and dozens of flying generals, from Haddington to Melbourne, in southeastern Australia, a journey of more than 11,300 miles. The British young aviator Scott and Black, the champions, completed this long journey across mountains and rivers in less than three days—only seventy-one hours and eighteen minutes. Such a great and astonishing feat in the history of world transportation is truly worthy of human praise, admiration, and commemoration in grand style.</p>
<p>However, the motives and intentions behind this aviation competition are certainly not that simple. No one can deny that the political and economic foundation of British imperialism in the Far East has been greatly threatened and even shaken since Japanese imperialism launched the "September 18th Incident" and its ambitions erupted. Moreover, today, the world is in a turbulent and eventful time, to the extent that negotiations on the naval ratio, which are closely related to Britain, have failed to produce results, and everyone is at a standstill. Then, an imperialist power with more colonies than its homeland must use all kinds of methods to strengthen the organization of its vast British Empire spread all over the world. Therefore, the launch of this Anglo-Australian aviation competition cannot be said to be its long-planned attempt and intention.</p>
<p>In addition, the continuous development of Sino-American aviation affairs and the competition among various imperial powers for the development of aviation in the Far East have also been sufficient to promote the launch of this competition.</p>
<p>However, as soon as this world-shaking international aviation competition was completed, rumors of a second competition emerged. According to a Havas dispatch on the 26th, French Aviation Minister General Teran is also planning to organize an international aviation competition from Paris to Hanoi, Vietnam, a distance of 18,000 kilometers, not much different from the Anglo-Australian distance. The news has come, making people marvel at the world's enthusiasm for aviation. However, how can this be an exception? The intention is nothing more than to strengthen the relationship between French imperialism and its colonies in the Far East!</p>
<h3 id="e234">Marriage as a Child's Play <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>I read a divorce news item in the newspaper this morning, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>After Lawyer So-and-so married Miss So-and-so, they suddenly felt that their relationship was not harmonious and often quarreled, which led to the man filing a lawsuit for divorce in court. However, on the evening before the court hearing, the couple still lived together in an apartment and talked intimately. When they appeared in court the next day, they looked at each other and smiled. The lawyers representing both parties also said that they should not bother the court. As a result of the court hearing, the judge ordered them to go outside to reconcile and live together. The two parties looked at each other and smiled again and left the court together.</p>
<p>The performance of this fact is really inexplicable! The news reporter laughed so hard that their intestines were tied in knots, saying that it broke the divorce record. The author also laughed so hard that their skin was aching when they saw this news item, which was both humorous and meaningful, so I specifically brought it up for discussion.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, the transition from arranged marriages to free marriages has been a good phenomenon. Although some conservative people are still stroking their beards and sighing, in general, most of the enlightened men and women are happy and diligently practice it. Its position has been established in law and in social customs.</p>
<p>However, perhaps because the change was too sudden, it resulted in the problem of overcorrection. The number of marital disputes in the past 20 years is indeed more than the total number accumulated in the previous thousands of years. This is not nonsense, but a completely true fact. It is common to be intimate and loving today and divorced and strangers tomorrow. Coming is convenient, and leaving is easy. This is the natural trend. Because there are so many disputes, people have doubts about the freedom of marriage itself, thinking that it is better to have arranged marriages than to have such disputes.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a complete misunderstanding. We should know that the reason why there are so many disputes in modern Chinese marriages is not the fault of marriage freedom itself, but the improper use of it. Nowadays, people simply regard marriage as a child's play, without any sincerity. They just want to have an affair and make friends, without making a pure observation of the other party, only relying on wealth and beauty. After marriage, they do not fulfill their marital obligations, considerateness, and tenderness. In this way, of course, it is easy to get together, easy to divorce, and there are endless disputes.</p>
<p>Although marriages in the Soviet Union are very common, with unions and divorces being nothing unusual, we cannot learn that kind of example after all, because our society is still a century apart. Everyone there has a job, and men and women have achieved true equality. Women also have economic autonomy and can move independently in society. Of course, getting together or divorcing doesn't matter. On the other hand, in our country, women are still as unable to be independent as in the past, relying entirely on their appearance to maintain their lives. When marriage becomes a child's play, it is the women who suffer.</p>
<p>The anecdote about Lawyer So-and-so and Miss So-and-so's divorce is the best example of marriage as a child's play. I hope that in this era of transition, everyone should be more aware of this. This is also a driving force for the development of return to normalcy.</p>
<h3 id="e235">No Way to Appeal <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>I saw a picture in a pictorial magazine titled "No Way to Appeal," a picture of disaster victims: more than a thousand old, young, women, and children disaster victims from Jiaxing, forced by hunger, gathered at the county government to beg for relief. The county government closed the iron gate tightly, and the disaster victims could not enter, so they sat outside the gate, waiting on empty stomachs.</p>
<p>It is said that this year's disaster situation is even worse than the major flood disaster in seven provinces in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Now, the northern provinces are flooded, and houses are in ruins. The southern provinces are barren land for thousands of miles, and crops are withered. The total loss from such water and drought disasters is more than 100 million yuan, and the disaster area accounts for two-thirds of the total area of the country.</p>
<p>Under the development of this natural law of society, the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy has become an inevitable trend. What's more, now there is an additional layer of heavy disasters? Therefore, we can always see telegrams from various places begging for relief in the newspapers every day, knowing how the people in the disaster areas are crawling on the line of death and struggling with hunger and cold!</p>
<p>Although the various provincial drought relief associations have come up with a solution for the suffering of these tens of thousands of living beings. They have decided to raise donations from all sectors of society on the one hand and ask the central government to issue an order to implement relief by work and reduce and exempt land taxes and surcharges in the disaster-stricken areas on the other hand. However, these are not fundamental ways to save the disaster victims from their suffering. What's more, distant water cannot put out a nearby fire? I remember someone sighed and said: In the present time of scientific prosperity, we have no ability to resist the infringement of nature, and the extent of human affairs is unknowable! If we want to seek relief, in addition to treating the symptoms, we should also focus on treating the root causes. Otherwise, providing relief after the disaster is just a routine matter, even more shortsighted than treating the headache when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts. These words are the truth.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, the disaster victims, a group of over a thousand old, young, women, and children disaster victims, sitting on empty stomachs outside the iron gate of the county government, fully tasting the closed-door soup, are reflected in my eyes again. What a tragic scene of disaster victims crawling on the line of death and having no way to appeal!</p>

<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Sure enough, the joint conference of Shanghai universities has decided to strictly prohibit university students from entering dance halls to dance. This Japanese gossip news was actually adopted by the university federation, which was something that university students did not expect.</p>
<p>The question itself lies in why university students are prohibited from dancing? The news from both China and foreign countries is vague, and university students are prohibited from dancing for no reason.</p>
<p>Some time ago, dancing was used as a tool to save the country, which shows that dancing itself is not a despicable thing. However, the image of university students dancing is not good, so prohibiting university students from dancing is undoubtedly justified. University students themselves have to take responsibility for this, and we don't need to say much.</p>
<p>But can middle school students dance? Can elementary school students dance?</p>

<p>What exactly am I giving you?</p>
<p>I understand that to be loved by someone is to give that person pain, I sigh.</p>
<p>You have always been a silent poet. The ideal world in your mind is so beautiful, with cherry blossoms everywhere. But reality has given you too many surprises! You are not happy, and you can't even say ten sentences a day.</p>
<p>I understand many of the pains in your heart that are difficult to express. Listen to the beating of my heart! Look at me—my dear, these heavy footsteps and locked eyebrows, and the fact that I haven't been able to sleep or eat well for so many days, please observe. I really love you too much, I am in pain, do you understand?</p>
<p>How long is life? We are spending this time so unhappily, so painfully, and every moment feels like a piece of red-hot tin melting into my heart. Tell me frankly, my dear, your depression is the same as mine.</p>
<p>(Eliminate me!)</p>
<p>Pressing against your body, my tilted head rests on your shoulder, full of crystal tears.</p>
<p>(……) Shaking your head, you grasp my hand tightly. My hands in August feel as cold as if a northwest wind has blown in the middle of winter.</p>
<p>Finally, we came back together in a third-class carriage. Your heart and my heart are so restless, beating wildly, almost jumping out of our chests. The result of waiting, anxiously waiting, is the restlessness of both parties. When you secretly look at me working alone at my desk, my hand wipes away the traces of tears.</p>
<p>(You belong to me, no matter how my life changes!)</p>
<p>I think in my heart and write it down on paper. Ah, my dear, this grand gift has made me feel dazed and uneasy for several days. I am ashamed. If you and I had met four years ago, I believe you would definitely love me a thousand times more. You can create many magical, touching poems, novels, great, and world-famous works of literature.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>The broken heart simply cannot bear this grand gift from you!</p>
<p>How can I not be sad? My dear, how can these two candle-like lives easily, easily melt into a delicate, exquisite</p>
<p>How can they easily melt into a delicate and exquisite thing—my dear, do you understand? If your eyes even glance at another pair, my heart beats so wildly that I simply want to escape into the earth immediately!</p>
<p>(You walk away with sorrow, your face is so pale, your eyes show fatigue, fatigue from life!)</p>
<p>I am restless, I live in an restless environment.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Analysis of the Family <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ren</p>
<p>The meaning of the word "family" has always referred to the place where people grow up and live: a collection of great-grandparents, brothers, nephews, sisters-in-law, wives, children, and grandchildren is what makes a family. To put it more clearly, it is said that what is within the doors, is a family. This is what is called a family.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the definition of the word: A woman asks her husband to be the head of the family. Therefore, Mencius said: When a girl is born, she wishes to have a family. At the same time, the word "family" can be interpreted the same as the word "姑" (father's sister/aunt): therefore, women can all be called "family." And what is called "大家" (dajia/great family) is also a respectful way of addressing women: as in the case of Ban Zhao of the Han Dynasty, who was called Cao Dajia, which is the reason for this.</p>
<p>If we extend the word "family" in a broader sense, the family, even in the past, was not so narrow. But in any case, the use of the word "family," although great, is not as rampant as it is today. Whenever they (the people of the past) applied the word "family," they would never go beyond the definition of being within the doors, so whether they said it horizontally or vertically, using it going and coming, the word "family" was ultimately used on the family, and would never be used outside the family.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, let me give a few examples:</p>
<p>家人 (jia ren/family member): Similar to saying a person in the family.</p>
<p>家山 (jia shan/family mountain): It is what people now call their hometown.</p>
<p>家父 (jia fu/my father), 家母 (jia mu/my mother), 家兄 (jia xiong/my elder brother), 家姊 (jia zi/my elder sister)... are all humble terms used to refer to one's elders.</p>
<p>家廟 (jia miao/family temple): That is, the ancestral hall to which people in the countryside refer.</p>
<p>家事 (jia shi/family affairs): That is, the affairs of a family.</p>
<p>家計 (jia ji/family finances): That is, livelihood.</p>
<p>家法 (jia fa/family law): Used to restrain children, so as not to trouble the national government.</p>
<p>家賊 (jia zei/family thief): Refers to those unscrupulous real goods, who specialize in doing things that lead wolves into the house.</p>
<p>There are also 家書 (jia shu/family letters), 家訓 (jia xun/family precepts), 家學 (jia xue/family learning), 家聲 (jia sheng/family reputation)... the list is endless. In short, what was considered a family in the past was all within a doorframe, just like the women of the previous dynasty, who were not allowed to take a step out of the boudoir without singing loudly for liberation.</p>
<p>However, it is not the same now. Women have been liberated (?) and are equally free as men. Naturally, the application of a mere word, with the changes of the times, why can't it be broadened and generalized? Thus, the definition of the word "family" in modern society has become increasingly popular, expanding to the point where it cannot be expanded further, and generalizing to the point where it cannot be generalized further. From so-called politicians, jurists, educators, writers, artists,... anyone with a skill is a 家 (jia/expert). Thus, haircutting is a 家 (jia/profession), foot massage is a 家 (jia/profession), and masons and carpenters are also 家 (jia/profession), and peddlers are also 家 (jia/professional). Even more inferior, rickshaw pullers can become 家 (jia/professionals), and why can't righteous men alone be called 家 (jia/professionals)? Even vagrants, con men, beggars, and thieves can all be called 家 (jia/professionals). Thus, the meaning of the word "家" (jia/family/professional) is great! There is nothing that is not a 家 (jia/family/profession) in society, and the world is all 家 (jia/family/profession).</p>
<p>However, in this way, the initial definition of the word "family" is now completely reversed. What was previously a term within a door for a family has now broken out of the door limit and spread to society and all of humanity. I am afraid that even Confucius, when opening the dictionary, would be confused, and even if Cangjie were brought back, he would be dumbfounded!</p>
<p>Someone might say: This is one time, that is another. The narrow definition of the past does not suit the present. The idea of being within a door should be overthrown! Since the family can grow legs and walk all over the southeast, northwest, all over society, all over the world, and spread to everyone, it is a good thing. You should not be talking nonsense. I say: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Yao Xiao'an, Pang Xueqing, Pearl Pagoda 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM Opening "Thinking of Melancholy"</p>
<p>When the fifth month arrives and pomegranates bloom, a young lady's heart is filled with longing. She longs to have two lovers, both handsome, romantic, and talented. The lovers' intentions are difficult to guess. They don't seem foolish or silent. Why do they come and go together, never speaking? Today, I, your humble servant, have nowhere to confide my true feelings. I am silently left with nothing to say. I contemplate indulging in romance, but with whom should I find joy, and whom should I abandon? This won't work, and that won't work. My heart is full of unspoken thoughts. If either of you gentlemen comes here in the future, please prepare fine food and wine on my behalf. Each handsome man should drink three cups of wine in my honor, and then reveal his true feelings. Let's not be jealous of each other but get along peacefully. The two lovers can alternate days, and when one doesn't come, the other will surely be here to fulfill my desires.</p>

<p>Opening Modern Men and Women</p>
<p>Society is open and values civilization. Men and women are all modern. Men despise traditional Chinese clothing and insist on Western suits and leather shoes. They hold a cane and wear pince-nez glasses. Women have permed, lion-like hair and walk lightly in high heels. They paint their eyebrows and apply lipstick. A smile turns heads and captivates souls. They stroll together in the park during the day and embrace in the dance hall at night. They watch movies in theaters and gamble at the jai alai court. Even more strangely, they can close themselves in a room for a moment and find satisfaction. Love doesn't need to be graded. Freedom is not hindered by shame. It's laughable how quickly they become husband and wife, and how easily they divorce. Such liberation is truly a joke; morality no longer exists. They must know that youth fades quickly, and every inch of time is precious. How can one waste their youth?</p>
