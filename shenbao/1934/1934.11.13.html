<h3 id="c12">凡爾賽各約興薩爾問題恒 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>薩爾而𥢊不足七百五十方英里。實一甚小之區域。方諸戰後德國本部失地方英里。甚屬微細。至其人口。僅八十餘萬。興戰後德國因割地而喪失之本國人口七百餘萬相比較。京不過什一而強。顧希勒對此區區薩爾區域獨加重視何耶。論者曰。薩爾者。歐洲之煤區也。以興德國工業有甚大之關係。所以重視。此一說也。又一說謂薩爾公民投票期近。希氏渴望此區域早日歸已。以實踐共所之宣言。故特以全力運動。以求投票之勝利然我入當研究凡爾賽和約之規定。而知希氏欲得薩爾之煤區。終非易事。煤區而不能得。則卽使薩爾重歸德國版圖。於其國富固無多大這增益也。</p>
<p>凡爾賽和約第三部附錄第一章有云。一一自和紙發生效力。薩爾境內所有之煤藏。卽成法國國家之產業。一其意卽謂薩爾於十五年後。雖可依居民有意思國聊之贊同。而歸還德國。唯其煤區。則屬法國國家這產業。不因薩爾居民之意思而有所轉變。依此而觀。德國國社常雖力爭薩爾之歸已。實際上鞏終不能悉如所望也。</p>
<p>其次。薩爾之果能歸德興否。京大有問題。一則以此地久主天主教徒興社會黨徒所盤踞。而此二黨又不能興希氏國社黨相並立。二則凡爾賽和約之條文。殊為圓滑。如各約第三章附錄三十四條。規定居民投票辦法之後。接著三十五條。卽謂一國聯決定薩爾歸屬問題時。得參考居民投票時所表示之意思。一此一規定之用意。卽謂居民對於薩爾之歸屬問題。雖可表示意思。唯最後之決定。則尚有待於國聯。今日之國聯。操縱於法英等國之手。盡人所知。其決議不致有利於德。可以預料。故縱使據投票結果。勝利屬於德方。而薩爾問題亦未必卽可認為解決也。</p>
<p>不寗惟是。依和約規定。又有全部歸還興局部歸還之分。其決卽謂縱使投票勝利屬於德國。而聯亦並不橫加推翻。將來究為局部歸還或整個歸還。仍在未定之天。至於薩爾居民顧否興德合併。乃一事實問題。法理問題不解決。前途糾紛。正未有艾。預料明春投票之結果。不外維持現狀興歸還德國之二途。設其結果為維持現狀者。則國聯不得不繼續其在薩爾之統治。在法人自必躊躇滿志。設其結果為歸還德國者。則法人必將籍凡爾賽和約這規定。出而請國聯考慮全部歸還或局部歸還之問題。法國今日對於薩爾事件之態度。異常強硬。其欲確保薩爾煤區之利益。至主明顯。故卽使薩爾居民欲歸德國。法國亦必不願京此能手。將來所能歸還德國者至多不過為煤區以外之土地耳。</p>
<p>又據和約規定。法國對於薩爾煤區。若無意開採時。得讓興第三方經勞營。此一規定。實出法人之遠見。其芰蓋恐德國一旦取回薩爾。將礙及其採煤之利益。故預為之防。但若薩爾投票愉定歸德。德國亦得出欵購回煤區。其價值由法德國聯三方專家估定。唯一年內若不付欵。則法國得標價出賣於第三方。京今日德男內之經濟狀況論。又安有餘力以從事於此。</p>
<p>最後。卽使德方力能購回煤區。而薩爾全境亦由國聯核準歸德。於法亦無多大損失。蓋據和約第三部附錄第三十七條。卽在德國收回薩爾煤區後。（法國或其人民。視本國工業上之需要。仍得依國聯行政院所定之合同價格。每年向德購買一定數量之煤炭）也。</p>
<p>總之。法人藉和約為保障。實處於進退自如之地位。言退。則可依明年投票之結果。興德談判薩爾煤區之賣價問題。卽可了事。言進。則仍得藉其在國聯中之勢力。多方興德為難。吾人觀於法國今日態度之強硬。覺德人終將不免於失望。蓋此非僅一實力問題。卽在條約上德人亦甚難興法爭衡也。</p>

<p>地點——八仙橋青年會</p>
<p>日期——十一月三日下午七時</p>
<p>主席、諸位同志、今天在青年會的邀約、要兄弟來講中國的憲法問題、兄弟覺得我們先要問一問、中國要不要憲法呢、這是一個先決的問題、中國要不要憲法、這個問題、同時又要問一問中國要不要建設一個新的國家、建設一個現代的國家呢、然後關於憲法問題的重要、自然大家都會感覺到了、</p>
<p>（一）憲法興現代國家這一個憲法問題、實在是中國幾十年來的一個中心問題、我們現在要研究、中國應該怎樣才能夠維持下去呢、怎樣才能夠生存在這個時代叱、大概諸位都是承認、要是中國能夠改革變為一個現代國家、必須具有種種的條件、這樣中國　能維持下去、現代國家的最重要的條件、就是法治的條件、無論中外、如要建設一個現代國家、大家心目中、必以法治為基本立場、中國以前以及到現在、可以說還沒有成為一個法治的國家、中國幾千年來、只是人治的國家、其結果是怎樣呢、不用說、是很危險的、茍如有賢明君主、國家就得著太平、人民可以安居反之、國家就根本搖動了、所謂人存政舉、人亡政息、中國幾千年來、都是這樣、這就是治的國家、不是法治的國家、現在的國家、是要主張法治、因為人治是使後來的國家根本搖動、而法治的國家則不然、誰者應該遵守法律　不因人的更動而所變異　所謂法治的國家興人治的國家不同在上、那末中國是否要憲法、就是說中國是否要成為現代國家、是否要成為法治的國家、如果要這樣的、就得要有根本法、根本法即是憲法、中國要不要憲法、實在是不成問題、中國到現在需要憲法的急切、是很容易明白的、不然、就不要把中國改革為現代國家、為法治的國家了、或者是不要救亡圖存、那末我們是可以不要憲法、如果我們要組織一個現代的國家、要救亡團存、就非把我國成為一個法治的國家不可、所以這襄便把這個先決問題、先和諸位說一個明白、</p>
<p>（二）憲法的成立興經過憲法實在是跟著革命來的、當一個國家走到沒有出路的時候、一定要革命、而且一定要定一個新憲法、中國是一個革命的國家、革命的工作、雖然還沒有完成、便革命的結果、是要建築一個新國家的基礎、卻是一樣的、在外國無論那一國、者有憲法　成交憲法、或是不成文憲法、後者如英國的憲法、英國到現在雖還沒有寫成黑字白紙的成文憲法、但他是有種種的基本條件、決定著的、這種基本條件、是根據英國政治的變遷、興幾百年來的歷史而定、即是一種不成文的憲法、除英國外、其餘的立憲國家、都有成文的憲法、那些成文憲法、多是根據革命來的、革命以後、才有憲法、或是以革命來推翻老憲法、成立新憲法、中國革命到現在、已有二十三年、中國的革命運動、也已有四十多年的歷史、可是到現在、還沒有決定過中國的憲法、原因是革命還沒有成功、所以完善的憲法、也沒有成立、民國以來、雖然有過約法、曹琨時代且有過憲法、可是都沒有好的結果、就是因為革命還沒有成功的綠故、</p>
<p>如其憲法是不根據革命來的、憲法便沒有根底、因為憲法是人民的要求、國家的基礎、現在南京國民政府的憲法起草、即是把這個國民革命幾十年來的種種原利方針、興建國的基本條件決定起來、以為一勞永逸的事情、憲法起草工作、現在已告完成、憲法革案在上二星期、立法院已經三讀通過、這個憲法草案、可說是已經成功以頒布中華民國的憲法了、</p>
<p>（三）國體問題這次的憲法草案、是根據我們一二年來立法院研究討論的結果、覺得起草憲法、有根本的問題要解決、這些根本問題、第一、是根據革命的歷史興理論來決定中國是怎樣一個國家、草案中首先規定著、中國為三民主義共國、這一條草案　經過一二年討論研究、立法院才決定起來的、</p>
<p>為什么中國是三民主義的國家呢、那先要說明什么是三民主義、三民主義、即是民族主義、民權主義。民生主義。民族主義目的、是要使中國成為一個民族獨立的國家、不受第二國或第二民族的支配、民權主義的目的、是使中國成為民主的國家　民生主義的目的、即是改善經濟制度。社會制度。使全國人民、者有生存的權利、三民主義、以這三個原帽來做標準、中國一定要用三民主義、才能夠建立起來、國家的地位、才能夠維持、因為三民主議是國民黨的主義、國民黨以數十年的革命運動、才造成中華民國、所以中華民國、是離不開國民黨的三民主義、現在歐洲各國、多有規定關於這一方面的條文、說某某國是某某民族共和國、這種規定、同我們所規定的三民主義國家一樣道理、再譬如像蘇俄、他是一種社會主義的國家、在民生方面、有相當的表現、所以他的憲法上、便規定是社會主義共和國家、中國是不個三民主義共和國、不能改變的、但也不是說、現在的中國、已是三民主義的共和國了、實在三民主義、還沒有完全實現、三民主義的軒家、還沒有成立、我們只是說三民主義、是能夠在中國成立的意思、總之、目的是要使中國是民族獨立的國家、不受外國列強的壓迫、中國的政府、是人民的公共機關、是由人民產生的、也即就是代表人民的、保障人民權利的、而且可以把中國的民窮財盡村破產都找到了解決的辦法、所以、三民主義、是我們理想的目的拿這個理想的目的、根本的方針、來做中國憲法的要旨、決定中國的國體、實在是毫無疑義、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見離求寒工獲老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>郭敦品坐下來，吸了半根煙，將指夾住了，向李士廉比了手勢，將巴掌搖成個小圈，嗓子裹留著半口煙道：總而言之一句話，善後捐，是一種最好的收入，就是找一個極小的部分辦一辦，有一年下來，總可以在方數上說話。李士廉還沒有答言呢，那賈多才卻在房門外呌道：士廉兄，有客在這裹嗎？士廉道：沒關係，是我同鄉，請進罷。賈多才進來一看，見郭敦品穿了古銅色的藍綢夾袍，外罩青嗶嘰背心，小口袋裹，露出一截銀表練子。瘦削的臉，偏是帶了些浮腫，臉上白裹，面前擺一頂氈帽在桌上，是他的丁，那淡淡的青灰色，十分的像一面半萎的荷葉。在這些上面的可以看出他有種特別嗜好。士廉從中一介紹之后，知道一個是銀行家，一個是由甘肅辦煙酒稅回來的。賈多才笑道：剛才我聽到說，什么差事，可以混上萬的收入，像西北這地方，這樣的肥缺，不容易得著吧？郭敦品笑道：賈先生既是銀行界的人，當然知道西北有些什么出產，在出產最值錢的上頭去抽稅，有個收入不豊富的嗎？賈多才點頭笑道：你說這話，我算明白了。不過有一層，這樣的肥缺，謀得的人，自然很多，像李士廉這樣初來新到的人，也想進行這樣的事，恐怕不容易吧？郭敦品將手指縫裹夾著的香煙給拋棄了，從新點了一枝煙捲吸著，他笑道：兄弟以為事在人為，天下事也不是那樣難辦的。署如我罷，甘肅這方面，就沒有什么熟人，小小的我也就在甘肅辦了兩年多稅務。（六二）</p>
<h3 id="c146">娶親鳴砲 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>每逢到廠暦九十兩月，大概因那時氣候寒暖適中，所以各地人家擇吉娶新婦，嫁女兒的特別多；蘇州人呌做［金九銀十］。娶新鳴砲，各地的習俗雖或有不同，㒄　大家以為這是男宅對新婦特別致敬的一種表示則一。可是據我想來，這並不是專對新婦致敬的。現在且把臺州紹興兩處鳴砲的情形來談談，再附以我的噫測，以就正於研究民谷學者。</p>
<p>台州人家娶新婦，一路鞭砲之聲不絕；新婦端坐轎中，可以任人攔興評頭品足，砲竹聲要直等到轎至男宅為止。紹興呢，喜事人家門前，朝夜常放那火樂銃的；放的時間和次數，也沒有一定。我住的地方附近，有一份人家在幹喜事，銃聲不絕於耳者已三日：銃聲之外，還時聞細樂之聲。</p>
<p>從這兩處的習俗研究起來，我覺得娶親鳴砲這回事，是至少含有幾分古代防禦的意義在內的。婦女是俘膚品。可以容人掠奪，這是古時部落中常有的事。所謂［砲］，又是戰守之具。聯帶想來，其意自明。臺州人家娶新婦，一路鞭砲之聲不絕，這是古時一種警備的遺俗。那時的人惟恐掠得一婦女，旁的部落要出來攔截，所以沿路要鳴砲。同理，紹興喜事人家門前常放火藥銃，也是古時一種警備的遺俗。那時的人既掠得一婦女而歸，或恐事主情急，要興衆前來奪回；或恐旁人艶羨，想合夥前來搶去；所以在門口也要時時鳴砲的。</p>
<p>以上是我的猜想，固不免有些武斷，然似乎還近情理；因於鄰近銃聲不絕中作此。</p>

<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>從外白渡橋的新建大樓右邊向北轉到天潼路下來，在那兒便可以找到我現在所要說的吳淞路。</p>
<p>吳淞咱有什么特異處？你只要向你的穿西服的朋友問一問，便　曉得它是興專買中式舊服的福建路［異曲同工］的；是的，吳淞路是專門出賣陳舊的西式衣服的店子匯集的地方，間或有幾對舊的皮鞋擺在那兒，但是舊的中式衣服，卻是無論如何找不到的。——你要買舊的中式衣服。儘可到福建路來。</p>
<p>在吳淞路上，大概有三十至四十家賣舊西服的店子；它們的門前掛著油布衣，摩登雨衣，店里面便是整櫃的舊西服，這些西服之中，倒也有上中下的分別，上等的大多是跟新的一樣，價錢自然貴；中等的，全套三件計算，十六七元便買得到了；下等的則只要七八隻洋便可以買過手。</p>
<p>到這種舊貨店子里去，第一要識貨，不識貨的話，翻過了面的西服也要當新的買了：第二要會講價錢，照習慣他們的價錢是特別提高的，譬如十隻洋可賣的，他要說十十隻洋，你只好從六七隻洋出價起，慢慢地加到十隻洋，這時他就可以賣給你了。</p>
<p>每逢換季的時候，像如到吳淞路去巡禮，儘可以見許多摩登哥兒們，也在那兒揀著合身的衣服哩！</p>

<p>這一座寢宮的主體是一座正殿，一座很高很大的正殿；它的面積雖然比不上北平大內的寢宮，但和頣和園裹的那一座比較，卻就大出許多了。在正殿的兩邊，像兩條翅膀似的排著兩座偏殿，成為一個顛倒的凹字形。偏殿和正殿的中間，有一條很長的走廊通連著，它的建築也很講究，頂上一般也有琉璃瓦蓋著，下雨也可以用；但是因為廊的位置在殿的前面，所以要從偏殿走到正殿，或從正殿走到偏殿，都得先出了殿門，再打廊下走過去，屋子裹面是穿不過去的。這樣，我們就可以明白：在事實上，太后的這一座寢宮所包括的乃是三座分列的建築，而不是整列連緊的建築。</p>
<p>我們隨著太后，一起先進正殿去。這座正殿因為前面有一個很大的庭院的綠故，光線非常充足；兩邊的偏殿，分離得絕遠，一些也不致遮蔽掉正殿的陽光，而它們自已，也一樣可以得到很充分的光氣。這種建築方法，可算是很適合衛生的了－太后約略一看，便表示十分滿意；尤其是對於那些先期打發來的太監所表顯的成績，格外使伊高興。這座正殿的裹而，共有三間屋子：正中的一間算是太后的便殿，伊老人家就在這裹辦公休息。（一七二）</p>

<p>— 沈宇</p>
<p>這是一件值得傳述的實事，茲記之以實本刋。事情是這樣的：</p>
<p>一天早上，我們的寫字間裹，起了一陣極細微的騷動。這便是這故事的展始。</p>
<p>原因有某西婦者，伊名基考夫。是我們公司裹的女職員。當伊至辦公處後，卽對該部的西崽云：［你檢到我的東西嗎？是天我會遺忘一包東西，內有高跟皮鞋一雙，金表一隻，是用報紙包好的。我放在字紙簏內，預備落寫字間帶回的，誰知忘記了。你檢到嗎？］</p>
<p>那西崽便轉問收拾該部字紙簏的出店。據該出店云：［誠見之，不過往常亦會見過，諸如此類的紙包，但打開看後，卻是香蕉皮或其他菓殻等物。所以這次不打開就扔了］</p>
<p>話雖如此說，但伊終疑心中國人［不老實］。</p>
<p>第二天，有一個衣衫襤褸的老頭兒——是每天清晨從我們公司裹挑了一對裝滿了廢紙的大筐子回家的老頭兒。他挾了一包東西來，碰巧問在那個出店手內。他說：［昨天在廢紙堆裹，檢到這包東西，內有金表高跟皮鞋各一件，知是這裹的，所以特來奉還］。</p>
<p>於是，那出店導他到基考夫跟前，他便將包子授給伊，伊當卽打開一看，則赫然原物，伊從錢袋中僅取出雙毫一枚，賞給那個倒字紙者，他只行怏怏而去。因此人們頗不直伊的吝嗇。</p>
<p>自這件事後，我們中國人的人格，在伊們的心眼中，已無形地提高了一層。</p>

<p>— 兪友清</p>
<p>在秋盡江南的時候，想到家鄉的小說家吳雙熱先生了。</p>
<p>雙熱名恤，是蘇州洞庭山人，住在常熱著不多有幾世了。他在二十多年前，在常熱南門米業小學教書，一年到頭，穿件黑背心的時候為多，他是一個東方滑稽之流，無論言語文字，都含有一些詼諧風味，自雙熱嚼盡，快活夫妻等作品，孽冤鏡是他得意之作，後來會到南京正誼中學，和上海安徽旅滬公學教過盡，在常熱辦過琴心報，又發行過飯後鐘，者是尋開心的文字，有新水滸長篇小說，把常熱認識他的人，完全收羅在裹面，可惜沒有完成，否則可以作海虞人物誌讀了。和徐本嘯到過廣東，辦過什么大同報，為了水土不服，忽然歸來，也組織過雙熱俱樂部，粉墨登場，調侃世人不少。後來招收補習國文的人，好像有些開門授徒，那時有頹然老矣的熊度了。同時他兼過琴報的鑒韻，有公孫劍小說刋載，也編過電報的閃電，困頓多時，沒有發展長才，已經魂歸黃土了。</p>
<p>他是不修邊幅的名士，一足有此不良於行，人名之曰吳跛，好像鐵拐李一般，和文學家蔣志範先生，可謂一雙兩好，因為一個是吳跛一個是蔣跨蹺，這兩個人，都是含有幽默性的。他看見了人，十十客氣，一點沒有老氣橫秋的樣子，頭髮鬍鬚很長，活像一個浪漫派的藝術家，常在常熱的逍遙遊吃茶，和已故的金石家趙古泥先生，終日茗談，詼諧為樂，自從他的太夫人逝世後，也許為了環境的關係，有些郁郁寡歡，日見頹唐．在去歲的秋天，會給我一對信，托我在蘇地謀一個月俸六七十元的教員位置，可惜我拙於交際，未能報命，現在想起來，我未免有負他的囑托了。</p>
<p>他做過一體海虞風俗記，從年初一說到大年夜，十分有趣的筆記，現在常熱市上，很難實得到了，他死了以後，他的兒子小熱，在常熱報上，徵求他的文字巽蹟，也許預備刋行紀念文字，能不能刋印，也是一件很難的問題。我聽見海上漱石生孫玉聲先生說，和他很要好的，在某年秋天，特地到常熱去訪他，可惜那時他還在南京正誼中學教書咧！</p>
<p>他的筆墨，我這兒很少，祇有幾對信，和兩首題詩，一首是題虞山小誌，一首是題海角笳聲，他允許我海角笳聲替我修改和作評，現在已不成事實了。</p>
<p>有人説他喜歡小脚的，這句話，我未敢相信，也許人家同他開頑笑吧！</p>
<p>秋深了，江南草木凋落的時候，想起了一位含有幽默性的小說家，已經長眠於地下了，人生草草，太覺得迅速了吧！</p>

<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>作家論並非現在才有的，但今年特別盛行；單在、文學］上就論過了五六位作家。特別是被論的作家者是我們的同時代人，這更添加我們的興趣。然而，倘若我們稍為注意一下，立刻就能夠在這現象的奧底，找出重要的意義來。</p>
<p>在過去的作家論之類中，我們很難找到滿意的東西。有的斷章取義，削足適履；有的拋棄科學，咬文嚼字。實際上，作家論確非容易寫作的東西，牠的作者，須有廣博的智識：在一般上是社會科學的，在特殊上是藝術文學的：而最重要的，還要洞悉所論的作家之創作的實踐的過程。</p>
<p>我們可以說，作家論是文藝批評的一種特殊的形式。是文學史各批評在綜合的形態上表現出來的和種批評。作家論，一方面在作品上分析作家的思想，闡明他那對於歷史的實現，對於［人生］的太度：這種思想和太度，都隱藏在披著形象之衣的事物裹，要把牠們顯露出來，就得雙管齊下：［顯微鏡］要用，［望遠鏡］更不可少。和分析密切地聯在一起的，是評價。</p>
<p>評價，是所謂人類生下來就具有的。但史科學地說，這乃是因為人類是一種有目的的社會的實踐者之故。和蜜蜂螞蟻不同，人類的行動，是通過了意識，受意識的指導的，人類根據現實的可能性，設定了正確的目標，朝這目標前進而行動。這種設定，就有賴於評價。當然，這里在分析中包涵著評價，在評價中也包涵著分析。</p>
<p>這原則適用到作家論上來，就是意味著：作家論不單是解明那作家是怎樣的，並且是判斷那作家將成怎樣，或應該成怎樣的。</p>
<p>不消說，在這里作家論的作者的立場和方法，是第一義的東西。作家論一方面檢討已發生過創作，藉此，在另一方面，指導正在發生及將發生的創作，倘若作家論的作者所據的立場是違背歷史的客觀發展的，所用的方法是違背科學的正確原則的，那末，對於上述的任務，顯然地是不能完盡的。</p>
<p>一切社會現象的發生，雖是歷史發展所致成，但須有社會的必要為根據。目前作家論的盛　行，應該在這種觀點上來看察。使我們覺得欣慰的，就是目前的作家論，大部份是沿著上述的道路走的。而這種現象，也決非偶然的。</p>
<p>我們的文學，掃斥了鴛鴦蝴蝶的集羣，排除了才子佳人的隊伍，沿著迂迴的歷史的必然之路，一步步地向前走著。現在，牠正走到一個新的階段。牠在探究現實，表現現實，弄好現下牠身上已發生過的主要的細胞之必要；藉這清算，牠可以知道一些［餋生之道］，以逹到健美之路。</p>
<p>目前作家論的盛行，並且是在科學的道路上盛行，牠本身告訴我們上面的這個重要意義。我們以忠於牠的不斷的努力，來作為牠的［新生］的獻禮。</p>
<h3 id="c204">從發明想到其他 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>最近報紙上載著兩件驚人的消息：一是航空術底新發明；一是死光方式驗底成功。</p>
<p>這種發明各成功，其實並不是新近的事，好久以前就在各個報紙上披露過，那裹不用得著作為驚人的消息看待呢？不過，正因為現在好像是第二次世界大戰馬上就要到來的樣子，而這種發明和成功又者可以直接或間接地作為殺人的利器，所以也就份外驚人了。新聞記者應該是世界上感覺最銳敏的人吧，我閃還能要他們不把這和為驚人的消息載在報紙上嗎？</p>
<p>從報紙上所　：幾空術底新發明，簡直是航空史上一個大革命，現在已經由法國空軍採用了，可使法國空軍獨霸天空：死光試驗底成功，亦是由法國陸軍所主持，不過發明的人是德國的凱勞斯興法國的克立斯馬斯兩個，並不像航空術底新發明那樣，完全是法國科學家，所以還不知道發明的人究竟將這種殺人的新利器買獻給那一國，也許會把它作為世界和平底工具吧。</p>
<p>法國一向是一個空軍占優勢的國家，現在既然有了這種新發明的航空術，自然是可使空軍獨霸天空的。不過，所遺憾的就是死光，還不一定為法國所據有。據說，死光能使人類　遇之完全失去動作能力，若用巨型的機器發射出五百萬支燭光的光線便可使敵人之飛機完全失去效用，因飛機駕駛者一遇此光立即僵死，飛機亦自然下墜；法國科學家們所新發明的航空術、雖然能使飛機飛在空中，十分穩，升降起落，毫無危險，並且完全出於自動的機關，但究竟還是要人坐在上面去撳，一遇死光也就完全失去效用。法國如果不將這種死光據為已有，要想空軍獨霸天空大約是很成問題的。</p>
<p>可惜現在到底還有許多科學家在拼命地發明殺人的新利器。現在正是第二次世界大戰快要到來的時候，一切的帝國者在盡量擴充軍備，而科學家一向就是奉仕於帝國底軍閥們的，為帝國底軍閥們發明些殺人的新利器本來也是意中的事，主要的卻在如何使這些殺人的新利器轉到反對帝國的人們底乎裹作為消滅大戰的利器，這才是目前最緊迫的一著。自然，我們還得根本要求另外一些反對帝國的科學家們發明一些消滅大戰的新利器。即是說：發明什么利器是不成問題的，而成問題的卻在為哪個發明以及發明來作什么用的。從這里，我們正可以看出一個科學家在目前應走的正當的道路。所以，就是對於死光底發明的人也不一定馬上就給一個惡聲。</p>
<p>依新聞記者們底口氣，這種還未貢獻給哪一個的死光也許會被作為世界和平底工具，這雖然是一句未準如所求的禱語，但我們不能不希望每一個科學家者往這一條道路上走。我們尤其希望每一個科學家都先行認清究竟哪一個才是真珔在謀取世界和平的國家，然後再把一切都貢獻給它。</p>
<p>然而，近來法國科學家又會經試驗過用無線電駕駛無人司機的飛機了。據說，有了這個新發明，飛行家可以安坐在辦公室中，一手把著無線電底開關，任意指揮遠處飛機進退，而且這件事不久就可實現。這樣一來，自然死光也會把飛機沒有辦法。因為死光底力量還只能人類遇之完全失去動作能力或立即僵死，而不能使無生命的飛機自身一旦毀滅，結果依然要讓這種用無線電駕駛的飛機獨霸天空。</p>
<p>我想，接著便有許多科學家來發明一種切斷無線電的工具使它完全失去駕駛無人司機的飛機的效用的。這到使我一併想起了我們底一般神怪劍俠小說上那么一套門法比武的公式：你有了一件制服我的法寶，我便有一件制服你底法寶的法寶；我有了一件戰勝你的武器，你便有一件戰勝我底武器的武器。孫猴子因為有了七十二變的本領，所以能夠大鬧天宮；倘若不是佛爺底手掌能夠將他底筋斗管住，恐怕全天下會被他一早晨就鬧翻了的。然而，好在就是有了這一套公式底進行；否則孫猴子老早鬧翻了天下還是小事，充其量不過短了那些讀西遊記的人們底熱趣而已，最不幸的卻是人類只得永遠作少數據有一種殺人利器的特權者底奴隷。</p>
<p>不過，這一套公式底進行，到現在已是應該結束的時期了。西遊記底作者只濫費了一點筆墨便湊成了這一套公式出來使人們打發去許多有用的時光，在我們也覺得未免太不經濟；而現在竟還有許多科學家不惜以全人類底生命作為犠牲來湊成這一套公式，難道我們仍得讓它進行嗎？人類底前史應該結束了，一切人類底能力都應該為人類自身底幸福而服務。在人類底真正的歷史底開端中，人類首先便結束了一切人興人間的門爭而將整個的能力都運用到對於自然的門爭和克服上。這時候，一切科學家決不會再互相競爭地發明一些殺人的新利器去制服或戰勝別人，自然這一套公式也就無形取消了。為什么我們不使一切科學家趕緊結束對於殺人的新利器的發明呢？</p>
<h3 id="c205">偶感 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 丁一山</p>
<p>在必須說謊的時候說一句謊話，對于任何方面無害，但對于任何一方面或兩方面都有益的這種謊話，我主張可以説。</p>
<p>朋友中有過例子：一個在臨盆時的產婦死了心愛的丈夫，她問別人丈夫的情況，別人者說好，其實他已經進了黃土。告訴她實話，則多死兩條性命的可能，到她聽了而無危險時再說並不算遲。另一個為女同學熱戀著的朋友誼。在這類場合下的說謊是不可厚非的。</p>
<p>今天，同朋友一道在室外照像，正好把光圈距離對過，一個毫無干係的人要我們替他照。老實拒絕，太令他難為情，中了講情面之毒的我們只好顧全著他的情面。他是毫不懂照像術的。幸而我們拍過了第八張片子，把軟片扭了過去，朋友做成當真的樣子替他照了一張。他問可照好了，朋友說好了。他要朋友送他一張，朋友說不一定會洗得出，也許拍的不好，假若拍的好，就替他印一張出來。於是這個不相干的人就不期望有個照片而高興了。我們仍然是不相干的人。</p>
<p>回來時，朋友覺得他可憐。我想他並不可憐。可憐的人是那些明明知道無結果而去求人的人。</p>

<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>在夜幕下面，黑魆魆的……</p>
<p>除了馬車轆轆的響聲，便什么都像死完那末的靜。夜已經很久了。人們默在車裹，忍受著一種發悶的饑餓，直著眼珠子等待著盼得快要出火的目地。可是眼前只是茫茫昏黑的一片………</p>
<p>趕車的把鞭子臨空一揮，［拍！］的甩出了聲清脆的響。把鞭梢向遙遠的那邊著說：［那就是韓家窰子了。］</p>
<p>似乎在鞭梢指示的地方還有顆黃色的火光在恍，車子顫震得厲害；抹抹疲勞的眼，已尋不到燈光的所在了。</p>
<p>［眼花吧？］心想。</p>
<p>［拍！］車子轆轆的加快了些。伸出頭，向剛才車夫所指示的處所仔細的瞅著：風吹帶來了幾聲狗的獷野哮呌；果然在不遠的那邊，蹲著一堆較黑的輸廓。</p>
<p>［真不是個大村荘咧……］微微帶點失望地。</p>
<p>接著就瞧見二點火光了。人們振作的伸著嬾腰，揉揉肚；把疲勞和饑餓全托給那閃著，三四點火光的處所。</p>
<p>是座二三十人家的小村荘。轆轆的，車子在一家露火光的門前停住了。敲著門，從裂痕很闊的門縫中，向裹張望著。屋裹忽然很快的變成漆黑了。</p>
<p>［喂，借宿呀，怕什么屌！］趕車的抹抹臉向裹喊著。可是隔了好一刻，裹面還是緘默著…</p>
<p>［—喂……］不耐煩的用力把門白血捶了捶。</p>
<p>［我們真沒什么呀！］</p>
<p>［借宿的—龜孫子才哄你！］</p>
<p>［唉，幾位呀，打那來的？］</p>
<p>［包頭。打包頭來的貴客—開吧！］</p>
<p>［暖，開吧］另一個蒼老的聲音。</p>
<p>門開了，一個年老人，擦亮火，把火柴向柏油燈抖籟籟的點著。一面借著陰沉掙扎的燈火，不安的打量著屋外的那些來客：</p>
<p>［老總，換一家吧！］</p>
<p>［是學生，不是老總，放心吧，明見會算錢你們的，錯不了，先生們都是學生。］</p>
<p>把行裝一件件的搬進去。各自拍拍身上的灰泥，絡續的跑進這座小泥屋。這種屋子，在近些日子的行程中，到處可見到：屋的任何部份都刷蓋著黃色的泥土，最低處，只一人一乎高。伸嬾腰的人，便可摸到屋頂的。連原有的三個人：小小的屋裹有十三個人頭在進出著。顯得非凡的擠鬧。</p>
<p>［有什么吃的嗎？我們大半天沒吃什么了。］</p>
<p>屋主人中的一個瘠瘦女人。灰白的面色，彷佛害怕似的打量著同來的二個護兵：［我們已經一天沒吃什么嘞，老總！］</p>
<p>在許多失望驚詫的眼光中夾雜著一些不信的神色。呆怔著她的臉；他們的臉；隨即便毫無主意的向屋裹打量起來；空鍋，冷　，上面擺著六隻碗幾雙筷子的個半蓋水缸，除了這些便發見不出什么別的了。</p>
<p>默默的，把頭抓著，大夥兒在東邊的一張坑上坐躺下來。那塌著鼻子特派來的護兵，按按身側的盒子，在他們身邊坐下來。</p>
<p>［别撒謊嘞，誰會白吃你們的，明天準算錢—是不是？］</p>
<p>［不撒謊咧，老總，真沒有一點什么咧。］</p>

<p>希有的晴朗上午天，轉過伸展在城腳下茅舍，總可見著［香莩］坐在河岸上，背倚著柳樹，乎揑釣竿，向隔著蘆葦的遠方跳望。深蓋破帽的頭顛搖不已，那蔴菰似的臉浮起淺笑，像向立在水中的鷺鴛行禮。</p>
<p>河寗可說是小溪，連一隻平底小劃也難以行過，由鐵下蜿蜒鑽出，至此行成一個池塘。蘆葦業生，荷色蘆花散佈　著淡的香味，遮過右邊的行和人刺鼻的浮土。經過橋上的行人不時立住，嘲笑的望著［香莩］怪老頭子。但他自已絕不留心這些，一種東西使他年青，誘他至數千里之外了。</p>

<p>［……不講理……賴貨……］</p>
<p>誰也不會相信他是在釣魚。</p>
<p>把釣鉤重新浸進水裹之後，他又望著遠方。額顯因為快樂展平了。也許因為看見紅雲，突然大呌一聲，他最討厭下雨。提起雨，他就會駭得脊梁骨發酸。怎樣過，那樣愁眉不展一天！連做夢也不會想到。拿白燒酒一直澆進肚子去。</p>
<p>他看著一翠魚秧聚集在岸邊，啑喋的逐著一片黃葉，他笑了。用大聲說：</p>
<p>［就是您，唔？此龍還難洽服啦，比龍！］</p>

<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>為著老婆做棉鞋黏櫬兒，沒把漿糊罐蓋上，便招徠了兩隻蒼蠅的光顧，沒聲沒響地，儘在罐口上舐吮，揮之不去，意其貪而無厭，用鋼筆尖刺之，均被穿腹而死，陳屍桌上，傲然自得。不料老婆卻大加反對，說道秋末冬初的蒼蠅已經是半死的了，感覺亦遲鈍得不成樣，消失了傳染病菌的能力，不會再遺害於人，何必再殺害它們呢。打［死老虎］不見得頂天立地的英雄吧，虧你還是讀書明理的男兒漢。</p>
<p>我受老婆這陣冷嘲熱風，明知她的話不錯，可是心總不甘，堂堂男子，豈可被娘兒們［吃癟］，當然，我亦有我的理由：</p>
<p>［不管它現在有害沒害，過去，它是［罪惡照彰］的，多多少少人口死亡在它們的身上啊，可記得，你家隔壁那個推小車的崇明人不是吃了一個死蒼蠅一家大小七口都患急痛哭痧死掉的嗎—還有，我自已亦為著揑揑蒼蠅拍，又揑揑食物而瀉了三天三夜嗎！往往一鄉一市的疫厲虎烈拉都是蒼蠅做著發起人，其為害不亞於洪水猛獸，毒品赤匪，現在不能以其衰老而縱任之，赦免其過去之殺人罪。你們女娘兒一味心腸軟，要知道萬一被它挨過這些節令又將成為一個殺人的魔鬼了啊。］</p>
<p>老婆恐觸動我的肝火，不復辯。然而，我亦因之而威焉。</p>
<p>夫夏天的蒼蠅，多麼厲害，多麼強橫，多麼刁猾，大之，則殺人盈野，廬舍威也。辟如你夜裹因臭蟲擾亂失眠，想在折天補償，蒼蠅卻會朝你鼻子上一息，唸唸有詞，你這裹正想提手擈殺，它已早得捷報，進雙耳朶，眼皮，卒弄得你不能［北窗高臥］為止。那里它的行為，何止［夷九族］耶。</p>
<p>然而，夏去，秋來，冬又到，彼橫行一世者已俯首貼耳，馴伏痴呆，一至於此。語云［時來風送滕王閣，運去雷轟薦福碑］觀夫蒼蠅可以知矣。</p>

<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>打鼓的</p>
<p>凡是在北平信過一些時的人，除了少數豊衣足食者外恐總沒有有不各［打鼓的］交過易的吧？</p>
<p>［打鼓的］，我想，確是一班破落戶和窮小子們的親密朋友，天一亮，他就擔著二隻大簍一手拿著一隻一寸大小的皮鼓，一手執著一支半尺多長的鼓棍，很緩慢地一條胡同穿田一條胡同，在得，得，得，………地敲著。誰個要出賣古玩首飾，他收買；誰個要出賣家資用具，他收買；認個要出賣爛銅廣鐵，他收買；誰個要出賣破衣舊鞋，他收買；……他所要收買的東西門類很繁多，不管是玩的，用的，或人家當為廢物擲棄的，他都不拒絕。一班破落戶人家，就得著他幫了不少的忙。</p>
<p>如果你是和他交易過一二次，而被他窺出你的那一點弱點來，知道你是一個過日不易的人，你一聽到得，得，得……的響聲，總用不著你自已開口，他也會走入你寄所來，很溫和地問著：令什么東西出賣沒有？要是自已吃的，用的都不咸到困窘時，他來這樣絮絮地纒問著，當然覺得膩煩討厭，少不得叱咤三二聲，將他送出去；但，如果是在連買不餅的錢也沒有時，一看見他降臨，牀　底下翻一翻，箱篋中檢一檢，角落裹，書架上，……各處細心看看，倘找出一些一向總不大注意的破鞋，破衣，舊報紙，琉璃樽之類，倒像獲得什么珍寶一樣的喜悅了。你將貨色拿出來，就使是多麼不值錢的東西，他也不會因看不上眼，立就走開的，他總在很溫和地將價目一步步的加高，至雙方滿意為止；比之一班當鋪老圖，動不動就以三言二語你一番沒趣的情形，是差的遠了。這樣的一個人，窮小子們還不覺得可親嗎？</p>
<p>［打鼓的］的生意，是很旺盛的。每天只要坐在寄舍裹，得得得………的聲音，至少也會聽到十回八回。其旺盛的原因，想來或許正是在表明著故都的墮落和衰敗吧？興的，有時我竟疑心這聲音或許是這蒼老的古城的喪鐘來呢！</p>

<h3 id="c211">電車上大談中國人的禮貌 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>我前天自松江趁下午三點零五分滬杭慢車來滬。在南車站下車，卽搭上高昌廟至南陽橋的四咱電車，其時三等中，人已擠滿，頭等車中，人雖也滿，但尚不至於十分擁擠，我見有一人，佔了差不多兩個位置，兩傍多有空隙，我就在一傍儕下去坐了，因為我走來有些吃力，所以沒有向傍邊一位打個招呼，在事實本有空隙，用不著去打招呼的，</p>
<p>間壁某甲（同伴夫有四五人）便發脾氣了，他冷笑地說道：［可笑得很，你定要坐這裹麼？］</p>
<p>我便立起身來答道：［你倘然坐在這裹，我便坐在那裹也不妨，］</p>
<p>某乙便插嘴道，坐下來也不曉得［打個招呼，］似乎命令式的要人讓開，興是豈有此理。</p>
<p>我道，不曉得足下尊姓大名，我無從［招呼］起我只曉得電車上有空的地方便坐，不懂得［招呼］的規矩。</p>
<p>另有一位某丙也作冷語道，難道我們看你上來，便起身讓你麼？真是蠻橫無理，［中國人不懂得禮貌，］</p>
<p>我道，我本來不曉得［中國人的禮貌，現在方才知道，中國人坐電車，一定要向傍邊的人［打招呼］［告罪，］然後可坐，這就是［中國人的禮貌麼？］</p>
<p>又有一位某丁從傍解說道：（這一位在四人中，年紀較大，約近四十歲光景，說話比較火氣少一些。）［礕如火車上，沒有空的地方，須得［打招呼］向先坐者請他讓開一些，在電車上也是一樣。］</p>
<p>我想再要同他們辯論，又想我吃飽了飯，興沒有事做，同這一般人去拌嘴弄舌。精神也未免太好了。但是這幾位先生，講得出［中國人的禮貌，］不像是十分下流的，因此我想到所謂［中國人的禮貌。］</p>
<p>他一個人在電車上佔了兩人以上的位置，看見人多，沒有坐地，他絕不肯稍讓，一定要人［打招呼］［告罪，］才方肯讓，萬一不打招呼，就要碰頂子，這就是［中國人的禮貌麼？］</p>
<p>我在火車上，常見一人佔了二三人的位置，并且高枕而臥，乘客儘管多得沒有立足之地，他老是不管，睏億的覺，非得有人［打招呼］［告罪］請他起來，方才慢慢地坐起，這也就是［中國人的禮貌麼？］</p>
<p>後來想想這幾個人到底還好，倘然他們毫不客氣，拔出拳頭，把我打了一頓，豈不是現吃虧麼？總處這幾位仁史，還懂得［中國人的禮貌，］我不會吃了大虧，恭喜恭喜。</p>
<h3 id="c212">東西南北 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>這年頭兒吃飯太難了。然而做人更難啦，萬其是咱小伙子。</p>
<p>［年少氣盛］這罪名似乎生下地來就套在你的頭上，不準你動一動：你一抬手，那隻手就抬得不像樣，一舉腿，那條腿又是不成規矩，最好送進荒島古剎做過三年和尚！</p>
<p>潘洪生死了，許多人稱他愛國志士：許多人搖頭嘆息道他年少氣盛，死而不足惜（？）</p>
<p>天災人禍，國事日非，為國民的誰不想舊起直追，救我中華，但是救國之道多焉：若跳舞，若唸經，所謂十年生樹，十年教訓，無論什麼事都要慢慢兒來的，況救國大道乎—卻一炸彈把奸商送死，以為這樣就國得救了，豈有這般容易？</p>
<p>不遇蓋棺論定，管他人家搖頭，總是個愛國志士，這樣動動火氣還是值得的事，如果連這一點火氣都全消，真使人不敢往下想呢！</p>
<h3 id="c213">讀書人 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>如說得雅一點，讀書人皀是［士］也。若嫌這樣說太舊了，那末就說［智識階級］吧！不過今年不是在提倡［火衆語］嗎？而比較起來，這些是不如［讀書人］三字通行！</p>
<p>自古以來，讀書人是最受人敬重的；［士農工商］四民中，就讓讀書人坐第一把椅子。因為讀書人是聖賢者（？並且讀書人將來便是做官老爺，應該人人敬重的。所以［子孫雖愚，絕書不可不讀］，萬一在天祖宗有靈，一旦中舉，便可以顯親揚名，博得里人稱道，萬人欽敬。如是，此生已不靈，為人之道不盡乎了嗎？否則至少亦是個讀書人，［書香世第］，未始不足以自豪的。</p>
<p>現在可不同了，讀書人從他的寶座上倒栽下來。</p>
<p>讀書人有什麼用？</p>
<p>一般人這樣說。實在讀書人沒有什麼用，［既不能測字，又不能挑擔］，至多不過賣稿子，做文丐而已。但是讀書人仍要擺的臭架子，以為自已是一個讀過書的人，你們這些野東西，何足道哉！［士可使殺之，不可使辱之］，還有［餓死事小，失節事大］，倘剝掉身上這件破長衫，豈不是丟讀書人的臉，失讀書人的身份？那是寗死不為的！</p>
<p>不過現在確和以前不同了！大家說：［農工商學兵］，還算稍留點情面，只降了三級，不會踢到腳後去。當時，一難得糊塗］　者致他弟的信中說：［士為四民之末，且求居四民之末而亦不可得也！］這種話，雖長了他人志氣，滅自已的威風，然不失為先見之明。可是讀書人大都給書本攬錯了，只會捧著書本，搖頭擺腦，一聲高，一聲低的哼：［書中自有千鍾粟，書中自有顏如玉］這樣，讀書人惟有同這個世界隔絕，在他自已心目中的世界過活吧！</p>
<h3 id="c214">上海的私立小學 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 幼農</p>
<p>着實，小學教育的重要，是不能諱言的。咱們中國自知道牠的力量，各歐美對於牠的重視，也就跟著來一下，於是，學校應運而生，慢慢地由國立，省立，縣立，而私人也設立學校了，這闢開生財之道不說外，也可以看出咱們中國人，對於教育的熱心。</p>
<p>在上海，因人口衆多，和租借地的關係，私立學校是格外的興隆，其中尤以小學為甚。自已會在私立水學裹混過幾年，雖然不是十足的內行，敢說比外行曉得多點，今且將所知道的，寫出來以餉讀者。</p>
<p>一個店面的裝飾，對於他的營業是有很大的關係。在上海辦小學，當然相同，私立小學雖然沒有官立的小學經費充足，可是也得在種種地方節省而將校舍裝得漂亮一點，這樣不但可以壓倒［同行］，也可以吸引顧客呢？</p>
<p>關於教學方法，和［兒童心理］，他們是難得研究的，這因為［同行］的多了，——雖然沒有煙紙兌換和典當業那麼門對門，戶對戶，可是上海人所謂［弄堂小學］的數目，也就可觀哪！——在這種嚴重情形之下，就不得不一轉口味，而將研究［兒童心理］和教學方法的問題，移到研究［家長心理］上去，比方這一地段那一類人物居住的多，就得合乎這一類人的口味，而將學科［根據地方情形］有所更動，如某區的幾所小學，沒有勞作，美術，唱歌，體育，而補以英語和文言文。</p>
<p>對於教員的待遇，因為處處有例外，這點倒不能放在例內，在種種方面，如顧全血本哪，裝飾門面哪，……就不得不在教員的薪俸上打算盤，請他們（或她們）辛苦點，甚至餓一半肚皮來服務，否則，你不幹就請便，反正失業的人不是你一個，有錢還怕買不著貨嗎？</p>
<p>女教員沒有也不像樣，這裹由是女子性情和柔，很合式於教小孩子，同時對於面子也很要緊，怎麼一個學校沒有女教員呢？所以請女教員的條件，後者更甚於前者，但，讀者切不要誤會女教員也是花瓶。</p>
<p>在訓教方面是怎樣的呢？教員薪俸的低，使他們（或她們）生活不安，而上課時數每星期總在千分鐘以上，課外還得改卷子，他們（或她們）的經神有限，當然的不能有很好的教授方法用在課室裹，</p>
<p>體育的場所和用具，更講不上，除去教室外，學生遊息所就是弄堂，上海的地皮像金子，那兒有間錢租體育場和製購運動器具。</p>

<p>— 萬國安</p>
<p>（三）第幾師都忘了</p>
<p>黑大個到了一個破祠堂裹面，由兩個掛著駁殼槍的傢伙領著，進入了正面的瓦屋裹，屋裹坐著兩個瘦軍官模樣的人，一看他進去就立刻扳起面孔問：</p>
<p>［你是日軍那一師的？］</p>
<p>［俺忘記了。］</p>
<p>［放屁—你第幾師師部忘記了。］</p>
<p>［俺當了七八年兵，就是沒把第幾師弄清楚，俺是把xx團xx營x連x班記住了。］</p>
<p>［你說白軍好不好？］</p>
<p>［俺不是白的紅的軍，俺是國民革命軍。］</p>
<p>［這個傢伙真笨，連這個都不懂，把他槍斃了吧！］</p>
<p>［槍斃俺可不在乎，可是俺還沒有媳婦呢？］</p>
<p>［你好好的說，我給你一個媳婦。］那個問話人笑著說。</p>
<p>［說什麼？］</p>
<p>［你們幾個月沒有關餉了？］</p>
<p>［俺們是打拆扣拿現錢，月月關餉打土匪還能押餉嗎？］</p>
<p>這個黑大個裝傻裝呆的，把那兩個傢伙弄的哭笑不得，只好另想高明辦法，當天晚上黑大個被領到一個另外的小屋子裹，他吃了兩大碗干飯，和一碗青菜湯，總算把肚子塞飽，於是躺在一隻破木床上，眼睛看著墻上的昏暗不明的油燈，剛要［打個盹］，從外面進來一個小娘們，黑大個眼前一亮似的，精神振作了不少，身上一股說不出的勁兒，把［打個盹］的心思消減了。</p>
<p>那個小娘們笑嘻嘻的，坐在黑大個的身旁，黑大個立刻覺著有一股熱氣，從那小娘們身下冒出來，他真有些按捺不住，這時那小娘們靠的越發緊，這一點沒把黑大個熱的喘不出來氣。</p>
<p>［同志：我們是真要好呵！］她說著說著就把右臂伸在黑大個的肩膀頭上。臉旦上的熱氣也一點點的熏著他了。</p>
<p>［哼！好！要好！］黑大個半懂半不懂這樣回答著。</p>
<p>［明天我們開歡迎大會，歡迎你參加紅軍工作，請你要演說一次。］</p>
<p>［幹嗎？怎麼呌演說？］</p>
<p>［呌你對氏們說話。］</p>
<p>［說什麼？］</p>
<p>［我先教你，明天你上臺上去說。］</p>
<p>［俺可學不會。］黑大個咧著嘴笑了。</p>

<p>— 遺安</p>
<p>土人說他受了［康道兒］的詛咒</p>
<p>羣醫束手恐將再無拍戲之希望</p>
<p>約翰巴里穆亞的體康，雖然已遠不及前，但也聽見了醫生說，他已好些了，就積極重新開始工作起來。今年春天，他又裝滿一汽車的旅行用具，帶了他的夫人和兩個小孩子，到育希邁脫山中去遊玩去了。他在山下，睡覺睡在戶外，吃飯在樹陰裹。醫生們以為那是他要恢復健康的惟一機會了。等到他回來了，他立卽開始工作，拍那張哥倫比亞公司的［二十世紀快車］。他一則病體纏綿，二則工作過於辛苦，等到導演最後呌［卡脫］的時候，他已是弱不可支了。於是他就立卽帶了他的夫人和孩們，乘了他的大遊艇，又出到阿拉斯加太平洋中的休餋去了。那就是他第一次的到阿拉斯加海中。他在那裹捉捕沙門魚，和打熊玩著。過了些時候，他又回來了。他回來的時候，路過溫古華海港，他就吩咐在那裹下碇，自已取出釣魚傢伙來，就在那裹釣魚。不想他正在下餌的時候，他的手指被魚釣紥了一個小洞。等到他回到落衫磯，那個手指，已經潰爛了。當他手指初被刺破的時候，他的夫桃樂絲考斯黛洛會替他初步治療過，不想竟無補於事。他的一隻手，繼續地腫起來，疼痛亦日漸增加。他的體溫，亦一天比一天高。最初他困倒了。經過了多少時的療治，他才覺得好些，可以離開病床了。於是他又聽了醫生的話，重新坐了他的大遊艇，出發赴阿拉斯加海中去長期休餋。這就是最近的一次出遊了。</p>
<p>醫生們者囑咐約翰巴里穆亞，就是他覺得好些了，亦不可立卽恢復工作，但是，大家都曉得，厶里穆亞的家族，是最能耐勞，吃得痛苦的一般人。約翰的哥哥里昂巴里穆亞，差不多十六年之久，害著疼痛浮腫的風濕病，兩𪯡　和癱瘓的一樣。十六年之中，他未會有一時一刻脫離過痛苦。他的妹妹伊塞爾巴里穆亞。亦是時時受著無限的痛苦。她害的是骨節風，時時膝蓋骨，以及其他的骨節臃腫起來，苦不堪言。她病雖沒有痊愈，可是她現在還天天在倫敦登臺獻技。</p>
<p>要是約翰巴里亞從此不再拍戲，當然他經濟上絕對受不到什么影響。他一切的設備，都已預先佈置好了，不至於再覺得物質上的匱乏了。他幼時是很貧苦的，所以他的籌備，亦格外週密些。他生長於一個優伶的世家，但是家世貧苦得很。他在十六歲的時候，從學佼裹逃了出來，要去學美術。他的父親因為他有美術的傾向，就羅掘般些錢，將他送到法國去學油畫。不久他錢化完了，又麼然而返。他在紐約在紐約日報館裹當一個插畫家，但是不久又失業了。他於貧困無聊之餘，重回到他祖父的優伶故業，但是很久很久才獲得戲劇界的一些認識。從來他到了好萊塢，就時回運轉，手指觸到的地方，竟能點石成金。不久他就積聚到幾百萬的家財。加以他經營有道，他可以終身不至愁貧了。</p>
<p>一隻康道兒鳥，［馬浪尼］，雖然關在籠子裹，卻能支配它主人的運命，頒給他應得的禍福，像加拉巴谷土人所說的一樣———那種荒誕無稽的話，要問約翰巴里穆亞相信不相信，他一定會說［咄—咄—］但是馬浪尼終久是他的伴侶。他隨身帶著它，親自喂著它，和他的朋友一樣——他是從來不肯離棄一個朋友的。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c223">評［淪落］—金城 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>無論如何，中國電影水準是提高了的，當我看到了［淪落］之張，我是這樣感覺著。當然，我們並不說這是一部十分成功的作品，不過在小規模的經營之下，我們看到這一影片的作者諸君，（自導演攝影以至於演員。）他們是如此努力，如此誠懇的從事電影藝術，到底是值得我們歡喜的。何況這一影片在個別的部份尚有著很好的成績。</p>
<p>我們可以說，這和［漁光曲］至少在取材方面有著若干相同的地方。然而這裹的題材，在目前真是太現實了，所以［漁光曲］的作者可以年到，而［淪落］的作者也可以看到了。</p>
<p>很類而易見的［淪落］的作者是非常同情於窮苦大眾的，同時，他也十分增惡正在崩潰著的富人之羣的淫靡生活。於是他用著貧富對比的方法，使兩種不同的生活展開在我閃眼前，於是窮人們的悲劇，便博得觀衆們同情了。</p>
<p>當然，在許多場合都顯露著表現方法的不夠，即是說沒有適當的技術，電影藝術的地將他們所要說的話表達出來。最主要的是故事太長太多，結果祇年到一個極長的故事，而沒有看到較多的戲的部份。其次是劇作者太沒有組織力量，對於一個冗長的故事，沒有方法組織起來。開始是兩條機同時展開的，由於一個奶媽將兩條線聯聚起來，可是當寫到第三代的時候，我們卻看到劇作者便沒有力量兩方面密切的發展到底，這裹除了富人家的小姐開汽車輾死了窮人家苦力之外，（自然這是非常偶然的。）二者之間差不多沒有了關係。而且到後來節直就丟開了富人的一面。祇看見窮人的一面，在拼命的拉長故事。</p>
<p>我們得指出的，這裹所抓取的題材太多，簡直是萬呎上下的膠片容納不了的。而且又沒有重心的，結果是許多素材零亂的陳列著。</p>
<p>劇作者祇是浮面的抓取社會的現象，而沒有本質的掘發。於是他祇是理解著富人們的飽暖思淫慾，窮人們的生活的悲哀，富人們的罪惡對照著窮人們的活受罪，可是卻把九華紗廠的輾斷手和汽車輾死永福等等，都輕輕放過了。（這裹自然有檢查的關係。）這樣便祇看見窮人們命運的悲苦，而在今日中看到明日的生長，成為作品的遺憾了，雖然富人們的沒落崩潰，他是相當指出了的。</p>
<p>劇作者中心意識的把握，這從開始時寫蔭梅的淫靡到後來又相當同情他的時候，充分的表現了來。至於人物介紹不清，如鄰家的出現過於奇突等。他如小的錯誤更多，如唐雪倩瘋了的時候明明喊著阿巧，為什麼范雪朋不會知道好是自已的母親呢？</p>
<p>為了［春秋責備賢者］的意思，我們對於劇本指講了不少，同時對於劇作者之努力向上，極力描寫現實，卻是可取的，何況在許多地方還表現著劇作者的聽明。</p>
<p>以上諸點，雖然我們說是劇作者的責任，可是導演不能有很好的剪接，不知道怎樣使盡而經濟，不能合理的抓信劇的地方充分發揮，而有些地方又　拉得太長，者是不能使作品精彩的原因。然而導演是十分努力的，他非常誠懇的處理每一個場面，祇是不夠把握的獲得劇的效果。這裹有若干好的場面，如拉塌車，塌車，塌車陷在泥裹的畫面，又如工場中的機器，輾傷了人當時的空氣，又如永福的臨終，假使更能經濟一點，者是很可取的。至於鏡頭的相當活潑，對於演技的指導，也極努力。來過如唐雪倩打包袱以布角揩眼淚，遠景和中景卻重複了，正表現他剪接的不佳。</p>
<p>演員中以李英，范雪朋，唐雪倩，文穉兪較佳，還有那飾鄰家男子的和妓女介紹人的（有金牙的女人），雖然祇有很少的戲，卻演得很逼真。佈景和攝影者頗有成績。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c224">觀［婦道］後感 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>這是一張經過數十位教育家的推薦，和上海兒童幸福裹揚過的一張片子。它是以家庭，教育為主題的，的確家庭教育的對於兒童影響，是很重要的，婦女們是每一個家庭中的中堅份子，所以她們和家庭教育是有著最密切的直接責任。因此最近世界各國都有提倡［賢母良妻］之說，如意國首相墨索里尼，他老人家就是一個竭力倡導［賢母良妻］制者。［愛之適以害之］這也是一般對自已兒女溺愛不明者之當頭棒喝！</p>
<p>［婦道］，即是在家庭教育的主題上所出現的一張片子，但宅卻沒有對於家庭教育澈底理解。故事是很平凡的，而劇作者對於現代兒童教育之避重就輕，當然是無可諱言的，他寫保生的愛吃糖，所以一再的在畫面上出現他在嚼糖，尤其是用關窗來結尾，這很顯然的表示出了劇作者的懦怯。</p>
<p>導演者陳鏗然在本劇里很盡職，他把故事很有條理的處理著，幫助劇情的發展確是不少，幾個鏡頭的角度也運用得十分巧妙。</p>
<p>演員方面，徐琴芳表現一個［賢母］很有力量，胡藝星也是一個很好的人才，但這裹導演者沒有正確地把他利用，那是可惜的，其他各演員大致者過得去。</p>
<p>電影是大家公認為第八藝術，它負有社會教育的使命，所以我們也決不是僅僅為了娛樂而才跑到電影院裹去坐上二個鐘頭的，我們要除了娛樂之外，還有更重要的教育竟義。</p>

<p>— 李信</p>
<p>紐倫很表同情的望著明谷太夫人笑著。川餘年以來，惟有她是紐約社交界的女沙皇。玥在愛琳有她袒護著，誰還敢造謠生事，來和她為難呢。到了明天，紐倫阿契爾坐在他的律師事務所裹，靜待著愛琳進來。他是勒特勃蘭，藍姆森，羅合辦事務所的最年輕的份子，所以凡是幾個老前輩所不顧意接愛的案件，就都交給他去辦去。但是這一次，他接了愛琳的委託，卻非常之滿意，雖然他不能不有所畏懼。一回兒愛琳來了，紐倫看著她，覺得比昨天晚上，又別具一種風韻，比他所能記憶的還要美艷。她的那種美麗，是活的，是生生不息的，是從內心映射出來的，他這樣思維著。他和她對面坐著，乎禮雖然翻閱著文件，心裹卻在思量著，她所以和別的女子逈然不同的是什麼道理。他想到了，第一件事就是她的裝束——板素靜簡單，別的女子比起來，就覺得著得太繁華，裝飾得過份，反覺得俗不可耐了。但他並不全在衣著方面。她內心的寗靜，亦是使她逈然興人不同的地方。別人比起她來，就覺得非嘈雜就是呆笨了。愛琳說道：［我租了一所房子，在二十三街上］。紐倫表示驚異道：［租房子？獨身一個人？］愛琳道：［當然。祇有這個法子。我明白親戚朋友們對我的太度——他們都是一樣的，除去了明谷老太太之外。但是，紐倫，我寗可自由些。］她又笑了一笑道：［等我過幾天佈　置好，你不來看看嗎？和梅一同來？　］</p>
<p>過了幾天，紐倫果然去看她的新房子了，但是他一個人去的。以後他就每天到愛琳家裹去，好像每天有公事，每天有文件要愛琳簽字似的。愛琳的新居，和她的人品一樣，有特殊簡潔的風味，並且帶有一種和煦宜人以及寗靜無譁的滋味。那裹可以得到精神上的休息，簭魂上的享受，和別處的金碧輝煌，富貴迫人的氣概，大有清濁之別。有一天，他正要往愛琳家裹去，路過一家花店，看見裹面有一紥特別的玫瑰花——花瓣特別的深，顏色特別的鮮明。他想那是配送給愛琳的花了，就將它買了帶到愛琳的家裹。他到了愛琳的家裹，將花交給了她，自已站在火爐前面，默然地看著她將花插在花瓶裹。他突然得了一種感觸，就說道：［愛琳，你不應該單身住在外面。你應當想想你的家族，那些愛你的人，那些願意保護你的人］。愛琳聽了，很奇怪地看著他道：［紐倫，我亦時常想著他們的。但是——那些女眷們——她們不會了解的——因為，她們從來沒有覺到過——那種需要。］紐倫不明白起來道：［需要］？愛琳歏了一口氣道：［是的，紐倫。你可不要像別人億的，將我拒之於千里之外。就覺得這裹的一般人，沒有一個肯實事求是的。他們都假裝著——］她突然說不下去了，她眼瞪著紐倫，然後又說道：［紐倫，有些女人祇要有平常生活之道，就很夠了，但是，我不願意瞞你。我是一種特別的女子，必定要得到愛情的——必定要有人愛的……我說了這種話，你是不是以為我這人太……什麼了嗎］？紐倫連忙道：［不……我想那是很正大光明的，你是很可佩服的。我從來沒有遇見過一個女了，能夠這樣侃侃而談的。］愛琳道：［紐倫，謝謝你，幸虧你還是個明白的人。］他慢慢走了過去，手扶著她的肩膀，低頭看著她的一雙眉目。他的頭慢慢低了下去，將她緊抱住了，噙住了她的香唇吻著，滿滿地吻著。她起初情不自禁地將嬌軀緊緊貼住了他，儘他吻著，但是一回兒，她又伸出一隻手來，嬌娜無力地揮著，想把他推開。她驚慌萬分地道：［你去吧，紐倫，］她抽噎著：［最好你馬上去吧］。她不等他開口，已經掉過頭去，飛奔上樓去了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">General Chiang Returns to Nanchang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Arrived at Xun Yesterday Morning and Immediately Flew to the Provincial Capital on a Giant Airplane</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui and Others Were Present to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his secretary, Wang Rizhang, and an aide, departed from Xun at 10:40 AM on the 12th, aboard a giant Eurasia aircraft and safely returned to Ganzhou. Li Jingzhong accompanied him. Chiang had traveled eastward from Hankou on the Yong Sui warship on the evening of the 11th, arriving in Xun at 9:15 AM on the 12th. Coincidentally, Li Jingzhong arrived in Xun at the same time, aboard a giant aircraft piloted by three German aviators. Chiang immediately disembarked, proceeded directly to the airport, boarded the giant aircraft, and flew to the provincial capital. The flight took only 40 minutes, departing at 10:05 AM, and he arrived safely. Key party, government, and military figures of the provincial capital had just dispersed from the memorial service for the Founder's birthday and the extended memorial week, and rushed to the airport to welcome him. Those present included Xiong Shihui, He Guoguang, Gu Zhutong, Ding Chaowu, Wang Yitang, various committee members, department heads, and secretaries of the provincial government, and over a hundred senior generals from the provincial party committee headquarters. As the giant aircraft gracefully landed, the crowd rushed forward to salute. Chiang disembarked to the sound of military music, wearing a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, draped in a beige overcoat, looking radiant. Xiong appeared dignified. After disembarking, Chiang removed his hat to greet the welcoming party, shook hands with Wang Yitang, and then boarded car number 214 and proceeded directly to his private residence in Beizeng. Xiong, Gu, He, and others followed in cars to report to the Chairman on the recent suppression of bandits and the details of recent victories in famous locations. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang's recent tour, which began on October 4th when he departed Lu to go to Hankou, then Henan, then Shaanxi, then Gansu, then Ningxia, then back to Shaanxi, then turned to Luoyang, flew to Shandong, then to Peiping, then to Chahar and Suiyuan, then to Shanxi, only returned to Jiangxi from Taiyuan on the 11th, lasting only 40 days. He traveled over 20,000 li through eleven provinces, diligently attending to national affairs and venturing far to the borders. Some say that the results of Chiang's trip not only inspired people across the country to rise up and work together to save the nation from peril, but also paved a bright future for the nation and the state, marking an important event in modern Chinese history. When Prince De of Inner Mongolia delivered a speech at a welcoming banquet for Chiang in Suiyuan, he stated that Chiang was the first person to come to the Mongolian border with real central responsibility in 200 years. These words are thought-provoking. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: When Chairman Chiang arrived in the provincial capital this year, military and political leaders all went to the airport to welcome him. He then summoned Xiong Shihui and Gu Zhutong to inquire about everything. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Li's Division Reports on the Recapture of Ruijin</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang, having been away from Jiangxi for over a month, noted that the bandit suppression troops fought bravely and repeatedly captured famous cities. After returning to Jiangxi on the 12th, he immediately cabled various bandit suppression units at the front, separately commending the officers and soldiers who contributed, and ordering them to continue their efforts to completely eliminate the remaining bandits and achieve complete success. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Li Mo'an telegraphed from Ruijin at Chenshi on the 12th, stating that his division occupied Gucheng on the 9th after advancing from Changting, and recaptured Ruijin in the Yishi on the 10th, braving the rain. Along the way, local scattered bandits such as the pseudo-independent 11th and 17th Regiments and guerrilla forces offered resistance and destroyed roads and bridges in an attempt to hinder our advance. The armed bandits in Ruijin forced several thousand people to flee to Yudu on the evening of the 8th, and those who refused were brutally killed. Several hundred corpses of the old, young, women, and children, with exposed breasts and bare arms, were left to rot outside the city for stray dogs to devour, a truly horrific sight. Ruijin was the location of the pseudo-central government. Its various levels of Soviet government, Red Army University, National Bank, and other institutions were scattered and chaotic, and the area was in ruins. However, there is an existing airport seven li north of the city, which was reportedly established because the pseudo-People's Government presented two airplanes, but the airplanes have been completely destroyed. The people here are gradually returning, and the market has reopened. They are very welcoming to the National Army because the bandit army came to collect taxes and conscript soldiers, creating extreme oppression, and the people were filled with resentment. Pseudo-currency of ten yuan could only be exchanged for one yuan of silver or central currency, and the order was extremely chaotic. Now, our people are finally celebrating their recovery. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Ruijin was originally the bandit's pseudo-capital. After we captured Shicheng, Hetianli, the pseudo-central leadership organs and bandit leaders Zhu, Mao, Xiang Ying, Bo Gu, Zhang Wentian, Li De, etc., had already fled south towards the Hunan border with the pseudo 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th Army Corps. When our army entered Ruijin City, only the old, weak, disabled, and surviving members remained. The Accounting and Hygiene Department is planning to send personnel to enter the city to provide disaster relief, medical treatment, and set up reception centers. County Magistrate Ma Xiangyao went to the city for post-disaster relief and to recruit refugees. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Longxi Dispatch: The Jiangxi Headquarters sent personnel to supervise the blockade work in western Fujian. Zhang Guanwen is responsible for Qingliu Guibei, Yong'an Zhangping, Tang Guoying is responsible for Liancheng, Longyan, Shao'an, Nan'an, and Wang Jichun is responsible for Wuping, Shanghang, Yongding, and Heping. Zhang and his party have already departed from Nanchang and will arrive in Zhangzhou within days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Victory telegram: Ruijin has been captured on the 10th. A small number of remaining bandits are fleeing westward to Yudu. We have dispatched troops to pursue them. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Military news: Li Mo'an, Deputy Commander of the Eastern Route West Column, led his troops to advance towards Ruijin, twenty li west of Changting, on the 9th. The main force of the bandits had already fled west, and the pseudo-central government had also left. Only a small number of old, weak, and disabled bandits remained. It is expected to arrive in two days. It is raining now, and it is expected that Ruijin can be recovered on the 11th or 12th. The bandits have indeed abandoned their old nest. Lingxian and Huichang can be taken within days. The main force of the bandits is currently still in the Zhuchuan area. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The East Suppression Headquarters issued a victory telegram from Longyan at 2:00 PM on the 11th, stating that various units of our National Army decisively occupied Ruijin on the 10th. Further news: Li Mo'an, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Column, led his troops to completely capture Ruijin at Shenshi on the 10th. A small number of remaining bandits in the city fled and dispersed earlier. Li immediately entered the city. With the capture of the pseudo-capital, the bandit nest was completely overturned. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The security forces and artillery of the Division have achieved victory in attacking bandit nests in Luoyuan, Xunzhang, Beishan, and other places in recent days, killing more than 50 bandits. The remaining bandits fled to Chishi, and the regiment is still pursuing them. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Li Han Hun Entered in 指揮command on the 10th. Because the bandits only disturbed the border area this time, the losses within the ruins are not large. The situation in Lechang and Renhua has eased since the bandits retreated. The Shaole railway resumed traffic on the 10th. Li Han Hun's troops struck from Jiufeng. Yesterday, they captured Chaliao. The bandits are trapped in an encirclement on the borders of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Shaoguan telegram, 12th. In the early morning of the 11th, the 8-9,000 of the pseudo 1st Army Corps of Lin Biao's troops fought fiercely with the Yanshou, 興,师旅, and 旅旅. The battle lasted until night and remained unresolved. In the early morning of the 12th, the Deputy Commander of the Independent 師師, 率率, led his troops to assist in the battle. It was not until 5:00 PM that the bandits were repelled. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, almost wiping out the entire army. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Chinese Government and National Government Jointly Hold Memorial Service</p>
<p>Central Committee Members Visit Mausoleum, Wang Zhaoming Presents Flowers</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian Speaks on the Founder's Spirit</p>
<p>Sacrificial Ritual Held in Front of the Founder's Mausoleum Yesterday</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: The Central Government and National Government jointly held a memorial service for the Founder's birthday at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 12th. Various Central Committee members first went to the mausoleum for a worship service at 8:00 AM. Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin, Shi Ying, Deng Jiayan, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Luyi, Chen Shuren, Gu Zhenggang, Xiao Jishan, Chuan Rulin, Zheng Zhan Nan, Xie Zuomin, Chu Minyi, Miao Peicheng, Tang Youren, Duan Xipeng, He Yaozu, Sun Ke's wife, daughter, representatives from overseas attending the Fifth National Congress, totaling several hundred people, with Wang Zhaoming presiding over the ceremony. After the presentation of flowers, they went together to the mausoleum to pay respects. Except for Lin Sen and Sun Ke, who stayed at the mausoleum for a while, the rest returned to the city by car to attend the memorial service at the Party Headquarters. Wei Huai, Chief of Staff of the National Government, Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, Chen Xunyong, Vice Minister, Zhang Daofan, Vice Minister of Communications, Lin Xiang, Minister of Personnel, Central Committee members Lin Jiqing, Li Zonghuang, Chen Bulei, and representatives from various agencies also attended. The meeting began with music at 9:00 AM. Wang Zhaoming presided over the ceremony, and Dai Chuanxian delivered a report, stating that today, the Founder's birthday, is a day to be celebrated by the Chinese people and the entire world. The Founder is the savior of our nation and state, and he devoted his life to the work of saving the country and the people. The Founder's contribution to mankind and our nation's morality and doctrine will surely be promoted and developed. He went on to say that he had a feeling in recent years, that is, at this time of crisis for the nation, the people often think that everything is in an unsolvable state, and they hold a pessimistic view. This idea is extremely wrong. The Founder never showed discouragement or despair after failing, even when facing great difficulties. All comrades who followed the Founder must remember this kind of persevering spirit. The current crisis and suffering of our country and nation are indeed a fact, but it must be known that all countries in the world have prospered in times of decline and succeeded after failures. Therefore, the rise and fall of a country, a family, or even an individual is due to this principle. The so-called "reversal after extreme negation, recovery after extreme decline," there is indeed truth in this. We should recognize the present as an important period for effort and struggle, inherit the Founder's indomitable spirit and the spirit of achieving one's goals, and restore the country and nation. We must not harbor any pessimistic or despairing ideas. He humbly presented this point to his comrades at the memorial service for the Founder's birthday. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Kong Xiangxi Summons Financial Personnel in Peiping for Instructions <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Went to Tianjin Last Night to Inspect the Hai River Project</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong and Song Zheyuan Arrive in Peiping</p>
<p>Peiping Dispatch: Kong Xiangxi summoned financial personnel from various North China agencies at the hotel at 8:00 AM this morning to give instructions. Ding Chungao, Ning Encheng, Cheng Yuanfan, etc., all attended. During the meeting, Kong inquired in detail about the recent situation of abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies in North China. He then received Shang Zhen, Bao Wenxue, Wang Kemin, Zhou Zuomin, and Chinese and foreign guests for talks. Later, Song Zheyuan arrived in Peiping and also went to visit and talk. Huang hosted a banquet at noon to welcome Kong. Kong visited the Forbidden City with Madame Chiang in the afternoon and is scheduled to take the Chiang's special train to Tianjin tonight for inspection, then proceed to Jinan to inspect the Yellow River. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Peiping Dispatch: Kong Xiangxi told reporters that his trip north was due to a long-planned inspection and an appointment with Chiang. He originally planned to leave earlier, but it was delayed due to events, and he did not fly to Taiyuan until the 7th. Chiang arrived in Taiyuan on the 9th and met with Yan Xishan, and the situation was very good. All circles warmly welcomed him. Chiang inspected Taigu once. After returning to Taiyuan, he flew back to Nanchang yesterday. Because he needed to inspect local finances, he did not return south with him. The persons in charge of water conservancy in various places have already discussed and negotiated on the Yellow River, Hai River, Fen River, and Yongding River, and he has also asked to inspect everything on behalf of Premier Wang. After finishing his affairs in Peiping, he will go to Tianjin to inspect the Hai River project, then go to Jinan to inspect the Yellow River flood, and then return to Nanjing. He had already met with Song Zheyuan in Taiyuan. The trip to Chahar and Suiyuan was canceled. The goals of the Southwest and the Central Government to save the country remain consistent. Wang Chonghui has returned to Shanghai, and he may meet with him after returning south. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Peiping Dispatch: Yu Xuezhong arrived in Peiping from Tianjin tonight. According to him, he came to meet with Kong and discuss Hebei's financial matters. He is scheduled to visit tomorrow to be instructed on future administrative guidelines. The expansion of the Peiping City area has been under discussion for a long time. Because the areas of Sanjiadian and Mentougou in western Peiping have not yet been delineated into provincial or municipal districts, the boundaries must be clarified in order to facilitate operations. The future delineation may be presided over by personnel from the Ministry of Interior. As for the matter of incorporating a certain county into the city area, it is probably impossible due to tax revenue and budgetary considerations. Only the proposal to make Tianjin a special municipality is on the table, but nothing has been decided yet. The appointment of various department heads is still pending because several people have not yet arrived in Tianjin. He will visit Huang and Kong tomorrow, and then return to Tianjin that day. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Peiping Dispatch: Song Zheyuan arrived in Shijiazhuang from Taiyuan with Yang Yongtai at 2:00 PM yesterday. Because Chiang's special train was waiting in Shijiazhuang, they divided into two trains. Yang took one train south to Hankou, and Song took one train to Peiping. Song arrived in Peiping at 10:00 AM today. After getting off the train, he immediately visited Kong. Song said that there were three purposes for his trip to Shanxi with Chiang: 1. To stay by Chiang's side so he could receive instructions at any time; 2. He had not met with Yan Xishan for a long time, so he made a special trip to Taiyuan with Chiang to pay his respects; 3. To inspect the political situation in various places in Suiyuan and Shanxi, so he could draw lessons for implementing policies in Chahar. Chiang's meeting with Yan Xishan in Taiyuan went very well. Chiang flew south yesterday. The three of them accompanied Yang Yongtai to Shijiazhuang, Yang took the special train to Hankou, and he came north, preparing to stay in Peiping for three or four days and then return to Chahar. Prince Yun and Prince De had a good impression after meeting with Chairman Chiang in Suiyuan and have now returned to Bailingmiao. Xiao Zhenying sent Prince Yun and Prince De back to the temple, believing that Chiang had not yet gone south, and specially rushed to Taiyuan to visit. Now that Chiang has left Taiyuan, Xiao will also come to Peiping soon. Xiao Zhenying is expected to arrive in Peiping tonight. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

Minister of Finance Kong has replied to the association, saying that using wheat to充賬 seems uneconomical, and the selling price of American wheat has already been designated for use, so it is not convenient to misappropriate it at will, which is difficult to comply with. If the association has no funds, he will help to find a solution and raise funds separately. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Saar Question and the Treaty of Versailles <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Saar region is less than 750 square miles. It is indeed a very small area. Compared to the territory lost by Germany proper after the war, it is extremely insignificant. As for its population, it is only over 800,000, which is only about one-tenth of the more than seven million native people lost by Germany after the war due to territorial cession. Why does Hitler attach so much importance to this small Saar region? Some argue that the Saar is a European coal region and has a great relationship with German industry, hence its importance. This is one explanation. Another argument is that the Saar plebiscite is approaching, and Hitler is eager for the region to return to him soon to fulfill his public declarations. Therefore, he is making every effort to campaign for a victorious vote. However, we should study the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles to understand that it will not be easy for Hitler to obtain the Saar coal region. If the coal region cannot be obtained, even if the Saar returns to German territory, it will not greatly increase its national wealth.</p>
<p>Chapter I of the Annex to Part III of the Treaty of Versailles states: “As of the date this treaty becomes effective, all coal deposits within the Saar region shall become the property of the French state.” This means that although the Saar can be returned to Germany after fifteen years with the consent of the residents, its coal region belongs to the property of the French state and will not be changed by the will of the Saar residents. According to this, although the German National Socialist Party strives to return the Saar to Germany, in reality, it may not be able to fully achieve its wishes.</p>
<p>Secondly, whether the Saar can return to Germany is a major question. On one hand, this area has long been occupied by Catholics and Social Democrats, and these two parties cannot coexist with Hitler's National Socialist Party. On the other hand, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles are particularly ambiguous. For example, Article 34 of the Annex to Chapter III of the Treaty specifies the voting method for residents. Then, Article 35 immediately states that “When the League of Nations decides on the Saar's affiliation, it shall refer to the opinions expressed by the residents during the voting.” The intention of this provision is that although residents can express their opinions on the Saar's affiliation, the final decision still rests with the League of Nations. It is well known that today's League of Nations is manipulated by France, Britain, and other countries. It is foreseeable that its resolutions will not be favorable to Germany. Therefore, even if the voting results favor Germany, the Saar issue may not be considered resolved.</p>
<p>Not only that, according to the treaty provisions, there is also a distinction between complete return and partial return. This means that even if the voting victory belongs to Germany, the League of Nations will not overturn it arbitrarily. Whether it will be a partial or complete return in the future remains to be seen. As for whether the Saar residents are willing to merge with Germany, it is a question of fact. If the legal issues are not resolved, future disputes are far from over. It is expected that the results of the voting next spring will be nothing more than maintaining the status quo or returning to Germany. If the result is to maintain the status quo, the League of Nations will have to continue its rule in the Saar. The French will undoubtedly be complacent. If the result is a return to Germany, the French will definitely use the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles to ask the League of Nations to consider the issue of complete or partial return. France's attitude towards the Saar issue is exceptionally strong today. Its desire to secure the interests of the Saar coal region is very clear. Therefore, even if the Saar residents want to return to Germany, France will definitely not be willing to let go easily. At most, what can be returned to Germany in the future is only the land outside the coal region.</p>
<p>According to the treaty provisions, if France does not intend to exploit the Saar coal region, it may allow a third party to operate it. This provision reflects the foresight of the French. It is probably fearing that once Germany takes back the Saar, it will hinder its coal mining interests, so it is preparing in advance. However, if the Saar vote decides to return to Germany, Germany can also buy back the coal region. Its value is estimated by experts from France, Germany, and the League of Nations. However, if the payment is not made within one year, France may sell it to a third party at the appraised price. Judging from Germany's current economic situation, where can it find the surplus power to engage in this?</p>
<p>Finally, even if Germany can buy back the coal region and the entire Saar region is approved by the League of Nations to return to Germany, France will not suffer much loss. According to Article 37 of the Annex to Part III of the treaty, even after Germany recovers the Saar coal region, "France or its people may, according to the needs of its national industry, still purchase a certain amount of coal from Germany annually at the contract price determined by the Executive Council of the League of Nations."</p>
<p>In short, France is in a position to advance or retreat freely by relying on the treaty for protection. In retreat, it can negotiate with Germany on the selling price of the Saar coal region based on the results of next year's vote and settle the matter. In advance, it can still use its power in the League of Nations to create difficulties for Germany in various ways. Observing France's tough attitude today, it feels that the Germans will eventually be disappointed. This is not only a question of strength, but also in terms of treaties, it is very difficult for the Germans to compete with France.</p>

<p>The Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun recently received a report from the Wakayama Unit stating that the Soviet Russian Border Security Team is stationed 2 kilometers east of Banzai River, Mishan County, Jidong, and is building a collective farm. Soviet Russia is also building an iron fence near Gao'an Village. The Kwantung Army's investigation revealed that Banzai is 20 kilometers east of the border. It is planned to have the false Manchukuo protest to Russia in the near future. (Hua Lian News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>According to news from Moscow and Harbin, Ludi, Director of the China Eastern Railway Bureau, sent a letter to the Board of Directors on October 30, stating the misconduct of railway police officers. The letter stated that although the Railway Bureau has repeatedly requested the railway police authorities to take measures to prohibit police officers from overstepping their boundaries and committing atrocities against railway employees, the police authorities have ultimately failed to prevent them. Such illegal atrocities have become increasingly frequent recently and are even more organized. Mr. Ludi's official letter also cited facts to prove this. On September 7, a turn-around engine arrived at Manchuria Station. When its driver, Kosakov, presented his passport to the border police team, he was arrested by the White Russian police and released two hours later. On September 8, a White Russian official from the Passport Bureau named Ulanov summoned Gorbok, a clerk at Manchuria Station, and claimed that he had been arrested, ordering the Manchuria police to detain Mr. Gorbok. The Manchuria police, knowing that Mr. Ulanov was drunk, did not detain him, and Mr. Ulanov punched Mr. Gorbok. On September 12, the Deputy Director of the Railway Board Office, Vilkovik, took the station's official letter cabinet. Since September 15, it has been attacked by the White Russian staff of the road police. Many of the unreturned letters were stolen. Since September 20, all official letters from Muling Station have also been read by the road police. On September 20, the Muling Town police officer forcibly opened the residence of the banner officer Gefudev and immediately occupied it. Mr. Ludi pointed out that these misconducts [have a very bad impact on our bureau and create the impression that the police agencies are completely overstepping their boundaries.] Mr. Ludi also requested the Board of Directors to [take necessary measures to stop the illegal destructive actions of police officers against railway employees.] (Tass News Agency, 11th)</p>

Therefore, this will have a significant impact on Japanese-[Manchurian] trade. However, the subsequent revision has a fundamental and permanent nature. (Dentsu, 12th)</p>

<p>Leader Reveals Future Plans</p>
<p>Attempts to Get Rid of American Economic Shackles</p>
<p>Havana, the leader of the Cuban Communist Party, Huo Chai Lersi, told the Associated Press today that he expects the Cuban government to be occupied by the Communist Party soon. Mr. Gong also said that the Cuban Communist Party currently has 5,000 members, and the party's discipline is perfect, which is very different from other parties in Cuba. The domestic economic situation is getting worse and worse, so the Communist Party will soon be able to occupy the government. After succeeding, capitalism will be reduced, and all national resources will be nationalized. Mr. Zi also disclosed the Communist Party's plan after gaining power as follows: First, unconditionally confiscate all sugar and tobacco farms, as well as all factories and banks. Second, cancel all national debts, regardless of internal or external debts. Third, cancel all treaties, especially the recently signed tariff reciprocity treaty with the United States. Mr. Gong believes that the treaty has made Cuba an economic colony of the United States. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e21">13th Anniversary of the Washington Conference, US Insists on Current Treaty <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Great Suspicion of Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>Britain Denies Alliance with Japan</p>
<p>Washington today is the 13th anniversary of the opening of the Washington Conference. The United States insists on continuing the Washington Treaty's method of promoting a balance of peace. People here generally believe that the treaty is the last effective method of peace in the current imperialist world. Initially, Japan also participated in the Washington Conference with full equality to seek joint cooperation in maintaining peace. However, to this day, American officials and people have deep doubts about Japan's various motives. It is generally believed here that Japan's actions in Manchuria and Shanghai, the recent discrimination against foreign oil merchants by both Japan and Manchuria, the demand for naval equality, and the secrecy surrounding Japan's handling of the former German islands under its Pacific mandate are all attempts to evade the treaty and carry out aggression in Asia. Japan feels ashamed of its inferior naval ratio to the United States. Most Americans also know this. However, compared to France and Italy, their coastlines and overseas territories are far greater than those of Japan, so Japan's dissatisfaction with the ratio system is also an exaggeration. The United States now wants to befriend Japan and plans to renegotiate a new treaty based on [security equality]. Japan needs a smaller fleet than Britain and the United States due to its geographical relationship, but Japan rejected this proposal, which made the United States even more suspicious, so it had to continue to insist on its original attitude and reject Japan's request. Some people even believe that after Japan expands its navy, it can further expand its influence in Manchuria, and Western countries will have no room to resist in the future. The United States firmly believes that Britain can jointly maintain the existing ratio with the United States because American officials and people all believe that Britain is not as good as the United States in dealing with Japan's expansionist forces, so Britain will benefit the most from allying with the United States. As for the United States, it has clearly decided to maintain the naval ratio system, even if it competes with Japan in building ships. (Tu Min Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>London, Sunday, the Public Review reported that Britain and Japan will soon conclude an alliance in a new way.</p>
<p>Today, political circles do not recognize this, saying that any rumors that the alliance is being re-discussed are not worth criticizing. According to the Public Review on Sunday, it has now been learned that a path to a compromise in principle has been obtained, and there are no obstacles. The naval conference can be held next year as a result. This is the result of the Japanese naval representative visiting British Prime Minister MacDonald at his villa. It is also said that the Japanese representative publicly indicated that because Britain and Japan will re-conclude an alliance in a new way, they are willing to accept a slightly lower method than naval equality. According to official sources, no compromise has been received from [Manchukuo] or Japan regarding the [Manchukuo] oil case dispute. It is said that the Japanese government's recent reply to the United States and the Netherlands is regarded as absolutely unsatisfactory by both countries and cannot meet the needs of foreign oil companies. The authorities also denied the claim that textile affairs talks will be reopened between Britain and Japan. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>London, Remembrance Day was held throughout the British Empire today. Except for some slight disturbances in Dublin, the rest were calm. The British Emperor personally led the Prince and others to lay wreaths in front of the Cenotaph in London. The Duke of Kent also represented the British Emperor in Edinburgh to participate in the memorial ceremony and placed a wreath in front of the tomb of Earl Meig. British Foreign Secretary Simon delivered a Remembrance Day broadcast speech to the United States, saying that for the sake of the world, British-American cooperation to achieve peace is an essential plan.

He advocates that countries should develop good neighborly policies, and Britain and the United States share the same interests on this point.

<p>The Saar Crisis Causes Suspicion</p>
<p>London, the anniversary of the end of the European War is in stark contrast to the joy of the crowd when the Great War ended that year. People today are all worried about the future. Since the end of the Great War, they have made efforts to eliminate the second holocaust. However, the cities of Europe are now secretly afraid that the world will soon be plunged into a major war again. The main crisis seems to be lurking in the Saar during the January plebiscite. France has recently raised its voice, saying that if the security of the Saar is harmed by the activities of the National Socialist Party, France intends to send troops into the territory. British Prime Minister MacDonald's speech at the banquet of the new Lord Mayor of London, Sir Kilkrek, on Friday can also prove the mindset of the people. The British Prime Minister said, "[Great Britain's efforts to promote peace through disarmament have ultimately not achieved results. We must now take defensive measures to protect ourselves. Once we are invaded, we should at least be in a position to protect ourselves. The assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou has ignited the burning materials, and people in London can hear the explosion of the heat emitted."

The officials of the two countries met in Valenciennes, near the border. After the Belgian torch arrived in Paris, it was offered by Army Minister General Moren in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Hero to strengthen the light. After the salute was over, the twilight was thick, and the crowd still gathered, not dispersing until nearly midnight.

<p>Socialist and Communist Party Clash</p>
<p>Imperialist Faction Demonstrates with 20,000 People</p>
<p>Shouting [Long Live Doumergue]</p>
<p>Paris, Paris, a serious riot occurred late last night, the aftermath of the fall of former Prime Minister Doumergue's cabinet.  Paris Police Chief Ma Xiang led a team to suppress the crowds and was seriously injured.  This demonstration riot was presided over by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, gathering at the Place de la Bastille and the Place de la Nation.  By midnight, order was greatly disrupted.  The imperialist faction also took the opportunity to stage a large-scale demonstration.  This faction had at least 20,000 people, divided into several teams, marching in various parts of Paris.  These people waved flags and shouted slogans such as [Long Live Doumergue] and [Down with Herriot], ignoring police intervention, but there were no riots.  In addition, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the hotel where Herriot, the president of the Radical Socialist Party, resided.  Because the collapse of the cabinet was related to this party, the crowd insulted Mr. Herriot.  The police had to disperse the crowd to avoid bloodshed.  The police, in cars, lined up and slowly drove into the crowd's line, and the crowd dispersed.  The situation was very tense at the time.  In front of the European War Memorial Tower, Socialists and Communists clashed with each other, and were also dispersed by the police, and many people were arrested. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris, today, this place is worried about celebrating the Armistice Memorial Day.  French President Lebrun inspected the Paris garrison at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  When the president left the camp, the crowd cheered.  When the cars of the cabinet members drove away, the crowd shouted [Long Live Doumergue] wildly, their voices deafening.  In the afternoon, 15,000 members of the French Business Corps held a large demonstration, but it passed quietly without any incidents.  The authorities made various precautions today to prevent disturbances.  Large teams of police were ambushed all day around the Arc de Triomphe and other places with potential for disturbances.  Only a few people were arrested throughout the day for minor violations of police regulations.  As for serious clashes, they were spared by making every effort to separate the various parties and prevent them from contacting each other.  For example, the Communist Party was prevented from leaving the Bastille area, and the Nationalist Party was kept in the Étoile district.  In the afternoon, a crowd demonstrated in front of the residence of Radical Party leader Herriot, and the momentum was fierce, but after the police arrested six people, they dispersed immediately.  Soon after, a large number of people gathered outside the building where former Prime Minister Doumergue lived, cheering non-stop, until Mr. Doumergue appeared in front of the building and waved to thank the crowd, and the crowd dispersed happily.

<p>Paris, today, the sixteenth anniversary of the end of the European War is commemorated.  Ceremonies are held everywhere in France.  In Lyon, the weather is clear and the ceremony is particularly splendid.  Mayor Herriot presided over the ceremony and delivered an important speech, urging all French people to unite with each other, and saying that France should establish cooperative relations with other nations, regardless of their political systems.  He concluded by saying, [My intention is focused on peace and love.  My most fervent hope is that France can establish its internal affairs and eliminate some concerns about national security.]  In Bordeaux, a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers.  Despite the heavy rain, the ceremony was held as usual.  In Lille, on the one hand, a patriotic ceremony was held, and on the other hand, there was a demonstration by the [United Front], resulting in chaos.  In Paris, hundreds of thousands of residents went to the Arc de Triomphe to pay tribute to the Unknown Soldier, but at the same time, there was also a politically-oriented movement by the General Federation of Former Soldiers, presided over by the [United Front].  The leader of the front, Mr. Peschery, led the way and marched from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la Nation, singing revolutionary songs.  When the event was dispersed, a small incident occurred.  The police intervened, and one police officer was slightly injured.  Apart from this, other patriotic groups, after visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, all went to the residence of former Prime Minister Doumergue and cheered loudly.  Mr. Doumergue had no choice but to go to the front of the building to return the salute, and received representatives of various patriotic groups and representatives of some reserve army officers, all of whom expressed their admiration and trust for Mr. Doumergue.  In front of the hotel where Undersecretary Herriot of the War Cabinet lived, some extreme right-wing youths demonstrated and were dispersed by the police without incident.  Today, all kinds of churches in France held prayers and swept the tombs of fallen soldiers everywhere.  Veterans marched in formation in many places, and the number of civilians visiting the tombs was also crowded, and except for Lyon, it was rainy everywhere, so the scene was bleak.

<p>Paris, today, various patriotic groups, after visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, immediately lined up and went to the residence of former Prime Minister Doumergue, cheering for Mr. Doumergue, expressing their sympathy with wheat, and vying to offer flowers to the society.  At that time, the former Prime Minister was meeting with Aviation Minister General Tland for a while.  Afterwards, a member of the city council reported to Mr. Doumergue that the [Fire Cross] group of veterans was willing to pay tribute to him before dispersing.  A Fire Cross [led by Colonel de la Rocque, delivered a moving speech to the members, advising people to strictly abide by national morality, and then ordered everyone to shout [Long Live Doumergue] together.  Countless people on the scene responded by shouting, and then sang the French national anthem together.  The former Prime Minister Doumergue went to the balcony to thank the crowd.  The [Fire Cross] members then dispersed in an orderly manner.  The leader of the group, Colonel de la Rocque, met with Doumergue for half an hour, and then exited at the same time as General Tland.  Colonel de la Rocque declared to the press that the [Fire Cross] group's expression of respect to former Prime Minister Doumergue today was just to let him know our feelings.  Mr. Doumergue's resignation this time was directly or indirectly influenced by some people.  We do not make any threats to these people, but they must bear their historical responsibility.  Colonel de said that we will judge the behavior of the new cabinet after it is realized.  After Colonel de la Rocque exited, a delegation from the National Federation of Veterans, led by General Ponlewei, visited Mr. Doumergue. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Financial Problems are the Main Cause of Political Strife</p>
<p>Brussels, the political strife in the Belgian government is fierce.  Today, it has become inevitable that the entire cabinet will fall.  Prime Minister Broqueville will attend the parliament tomorrow to issue a declaration of inability to preside over the central government.  The personal dispute between Finance Minister Sepchin and the Senate Budget Committee member Guqin Breuk over the issue of balancing the budget for the coming year is the main cause of the political strife.  Belgian Foreign Minister Jaspar will likely take over as prime minister and form a new cabinet.  The current cabinet took office on June 12 this year.  Mr. Jaspar is also a financial expert and has served as finance minister.  After Jaspar establishes a new government, there will be no major changes to the existing party divisions, and he is unwilling to shake the balance between the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party in the current cabinet.  Belgium's economic situation has been greatly affected since some countries abandoned the gold standard.  However, although the government fell on financial issues, senior officials still said that the currency system or the gold standard issue has not been drawn into the vortex, because all parties unanimously oppose abandoning the gold standard and implementing inflation.

<p>Istanbul, the visit of the French super destroyers Coubert and Cassard to Istanbul and the visit of six French military aircraft soon are signs of a compromise between France and Turkey.  It is also heard that this matter was launched in the spring.  The newspaper also shows that Turkey's attitude towards Germany is becoming increasingly cold.  The restoration of Germany's former position in Turkey can also be seen at the International Barliamentary Conference.  When the conference was held, the French representatives were the most noticed, and the Turkish representatives unanimously supported the proposals of the French representatives.  Due to geographical and other reasons, Turkey's agreement with Russia is also a powerful factor in promoting this trend.  Although Germany is Turkey's best market and Turkey will also rely on trade with Germany, Turkey will be an important intersection in the European coalition and horizontal situation.  France intends to drive out German influence in Turkey with economic policies, and Turkey also wants to welcome competition between the two countries to reap the benefits of the fisherman.

If the accusations are true, all Catholic priests in Mexico will be expelled from the country. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Unprecedented in Thirty Years</p>
<p>Tokyo, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the final total harvest of rice from the end of October this year to the present is expected to be 50,746,140 stones.  Since September 20, according to the first survey of the total harvest, the typhoon was very harmful, and the climate was not adjusted, the sunny days were too short, and the shade harmed the maturity of the seedlings, so the actual harvest was reduced by 20,829,777 stones compared with last year, accounting for 28.4%, and the average total harvest in the previous five years was also reduced by 11,837,402 stones, becoming 18.9%.  The above figures show that since the disastrous harvest of 50,259,000 stones in Taisho 2nd year, this has become the latest new record.  In terms of harvest volume, it is also less than that of Meiji 38th year. This year's disastrous harvest is an unprecedented famine since Meiji 38th year, and it is a major disaster in 30 years.

<p>Military Attitude Abnormally Tough</p>
<p>Will Affect the Future of the Political Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, the military's ability to demand the restoration of the next year's budget is very strong.  It is expected that Minister of Finance Fujii's political compromise in the future will be ineffective.  This especially affects the future of the current cabinet.  If the military's demand for restoration intensifies in the future compromise and exceeds the amount that Minister of Finance Fujii can admit, the Minister of Finance will not be able to change the budget formulation due to face.  In order to complete the budget formulation satisfactorily, it will be necessary to admit most of the military's demands.  At this time, the content of the budget may destroy Minister of Finance Fujii's financial beliefs and sound finance. Therefore, the people around the Minister of Finance are cautious about the actions taken by the Minister of Finance. On the one hand, the parliament will focus its questions on financial issues. Whether the Minister of Finance's health can withstand this struggle is a problem. At this time, the political phenomenon caused by the Minister of Finance is most noteworthy. (Electric Communication Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the Army Ministry's budget for the coming year has been greatly reduced by the Ministry of Finance.  The attitude of the General Staff Headquarters is quite strong, and it demands the complete restoration of this.  However, the Army Ministry authorities have decided to demand the restoration of the following budget items: 10 million yuan for materials maintenance, 40 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident, 5 million yuan for equipment improvement, 5 million yuan for review of weapons and other general new business expenses, and 25 million yuan for aviation and air defense facilities, totaling 85 million yuan.  It was negotiated with the Ministry of Finance on the 9th and 10th. However, the Ministry of Finance insisted on opposing the increase in the issuance of public bonds, exceeding the attitude of Minister of Finance San Fujii's established number, and refused to give way.  Therefore, the negotiations between the Army and the Ministry of Finance Affairs Bureau completely encountered a reef.  Whether the future can be opened up depends on the results of the direct political negotiations between Army Minister Hayashi and Minister of Finance Fujii after Hayashi returns to Tokyo.  Army Minister Hayashi will issue a statement saying that there is only one way now, that is, the military should retreat or issue more public bonds, etc. His intention is to hope to issue more bonds.  If the opinions of the Army Minister and the Minister of Finance cannot be consistent, then wait for Prime Minister Okada's mediation.  The budgets of the provinces were all submitted to the Ministry of Finance on the 11th. The Accounting Bureau generally decided on the following review policy:</p>
<p>1. Restore the old approvals other than the supply of financial resources.</p>
<p>2. For the military expenditure requirements, try to admit the total amount by saving the established expenses.</p>

The demands of the Army and Navy together amount to more than 100 million yuan. Other departments, such as Internal Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Communications, and Transportation, also have considerable demands. The total amount is expected to reach more than 300 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance believes that there are no such financial resources and cannot approve the restored amount. Minister of Finance Fujii consulted with former Minister of Finance Takahashi on the matter of increasing taxes and budgets. As a result, there is really no way to cope. Navy Minister Osumi believes that the national defense budget should be increased in view of the current international situation. After detailed discussions with the relevant departments, he strives to restore the amount. After the cabinet meeting on the 5th, he immediately summoned Vice Minister Hasegawa, Bureau Chief Murakami, and Military Affairs Bureau Chief Yoshida to discuss the investigation report returned by the Ministry of Finance. They all advocated thoroughly demanding the amount to achieve the goal. According to the Navy's budget for the next year: 1. The established expenditure is 395,640,000 yuan, including a basic budget of 228,620,000 yuan, warship construction costs of 156,420,000 yuan, and air force expansion costs of 10,600,000 yuan; 2. The new request is 294,700,000 yuan, totaling 690,000,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance only approved 95 million yuan of the new request of 294.7 million yuan. Therefore, the construction of warships, the modification of battleships, and the expansion of the air force have all been severely hit, making it difficult to cope with the international crisis in 1935 and 1936. On the 6th, the Minister of the Army summoned the chief of the Bureau and Division Chiefs, including the Deputy Minister Hashimoto to discuss the investigation report of the Ministry of Finance. In view of the current situation, the minimum necessary amount for national defense is a new request of 260 million yuan, while the Ministry of Finance, from the standpoint of national finance, refused to approve 160 million yuan, so it also strongly demanded restoration. The Army's budget includes 10 million yuan for material maintenance, 30 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident, 30 million yuan for air and air defense, 6 million yuan for weapon improvement, and 4 million yuan for other expenses. 3. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also held a meeting in the department overnight to demand the restoration of 20 million yuan, while the transfer of 57 million yuan for local financial adjustment and 2.4 million yuan for medical care were temporarily reserved and a decision was made after further research. 4. The Ministry of Finance (Ministry of Finance) has no restoration requirements in principle, but it proposes to increase the following items: the budget for the Manchurian Affairs Bureau's Northeast Revitalization Investigation Committee, the budget for disaster recovery, part of the repairs for Yokohama, Kobe, and Moji customs and tax matters, and the restoration of relations with the Cabinet and external agencies. 5. As a result of deliberations on the review report of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry reached 16 million yuan due to the rural relief issue. 6. The restoration request of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is 2.06 million yuan. Looking at the above-mentioned huge budget, the Minister of Finance is caught in a dilemma, so the financial future is becoming more and more complicated.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Miracles of the Desert <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Anxi is far from the border of Gansu Province, controlling the vital transportation hub of Gansu and Xinjiang. Its territory is vast, larger than Zhejiang Province. Its residents are diverse and have historically been difficult to govern. In the past few years, after the ravages of Wu Yanzhang and Ma Zhongying, the local area has become impoverished and is in a dire state. Since last year, when Ma Zhongying led his troops to Xinjiang, the first regiment of the 298th Brigade of the 100th Division has been stationed there. Local order has gradually become stable, and the people's vitality can also be restored. In addition, Fan Yuancen, the director of the special tax bureau, has been actively contacting merchants in Xinjiang to ensure that new goods are still regularly transported to Anxi for trade with goods from Baotou and Suiyuan. From then on, the transportation between Gansu and Xinjiang can barely be maintained, and the commercial transportation outside the frontier is gradually showing signs of recovery. Ma Shou Xuan, the regiment commander of the stationed army, is strict in governing the army and kind to people. The border people praised him. Because the troops are stationed in various places, only one battalion and one artillery company are stationed in Anxi. At 8 AM on the fourth day of the reporter's arrival in Anxi, at the invitation of Regiment Commander Ma, the reporter, along with County Magistrate Xie and Director Fan, entered the barracks and saw that the soldiers were full of energy. All their actions, advances, and retreats were quick and organized. Especially when performing the division parade, a strong wind suddenly rose, and sand blew into their eyes, but the formation remained perfectly disciplined. Secondly, they were technically skilled. All exercises such as broadsword, boxing, bayonet, swordsmanship, stick fighting, and iron bar exercises were very flexible. Thirdly, the clothing was neat and tidy. Not only were the clothes, hats, and shoes all the same, but the length of the hair also had the characteristics of simultaneous haircuts during mobilization. Regiment Commander Ma is not only good at governing the army, but also very dedicated to local construction projects. Once, the reporter unintentionally mentioned to Ma that the troops stationed in a certain place were able to vigorously support local construction, personnel repairs, and afforestation, and achieved remarkable results. Later, when the reporter returned from Dunhuang, within a short period of ten days, the four main streets in the east, west, south, and north of Anxi City had become flat, wide, and tidy avenues. Water ditches were also dug deep on both sides in preparation for planting willows in the coming spring. Later, because the ditches were not covered with bricks, which was inconvenient for large vehicles to drive on, the previous effort was not different. The reporter immediately suggested filling them shallowly. If this kind of [goodness is followed, and evil is corrected] spirit can be fully developed, and the promotion of senior officials can be obtained, it will be used to implement the post-military land reclamation (especially since Longxi has vast land and sparse population, and a large army is stationed there, it is very suitable for land reclamation), then the effect will be even greater.</p>
<p>The reporter has been staying in Anxi for several days, but there is no good news about the road conditions to Xinjiang. The car from Lanzhou was originally intended to go to Dihua to transport intestines, but has also received a telegram from Dihua, instructing them to wait here for the time being. The reporter interviewed Xu Tiemin, director of the Anxi station of the Central Asian Airlines. According to him, aviation in Xinjiang has been suspended since September of last year, and it will soon be over a year. This is not only a very regrettable thing in terms of the future significance of Eurasian transportation, but also the losses suffered by border culture, commerce, and the company's own operations are also considerable. Xinjiang's specialties, such as gold, antelope horns, and musk, are always transported to the east by air by wealthy merchants to catch the good prices, resulting in all seats being fully booked every time they fly. Some people even book seats in advance or charter flights alone for more than 15,000 yuan. It can be seen that if this airline can be restored as soon as possible, it will be of great practical benefit in all aspects. According to the responsible person of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Xinjiang's postal service has been sluggish since the 21st year. On March 21 of this year, there was a letter from Hami. By April, it had been opened to Zhenxi, Muleihe, and Qitai, but it was interrupted again in early August. Only Hami can still communicate. As for Dihua and Southern Xinjiang, communication has been broken for three years. More than 190 large bags of parcels destined for Dihua from Hunan, Shanghai, Beiping, and Gansu are stored in the Anxi Post Office. It is said that there are also many stored in the Suzhou and Hami post offices. Most of the recipients of these parcels stored in the Anxi Bureau are Jin Shuren, the former chairman of Xinjiang. Jin has already settled in Taiwan, so it is also interesting to have the parcels waiting to be sent to Xinjiang. Xinjiang's telegraph service was interrupted in May of the 20th year, and telegraph and telephone services to Hami were finally opened in May of last year. On July 1st of this year, telegraph services to Dihua were also opened, which is really good news for transportation in the frontier. Since the road conditions to Xinjiang were unclear, I first made an inspection of Dunhuang. Dunhuang is 280 li southwest of Anxi City. Initially, I went out of the west gate and traveled diagonally to the southwest. The green willows and yellow wheat along the way were quite pleasant. The old Guazhou City, which was 40 li away, used to have more than a thousand households, but was destroyed in the Tongzhi War and only a broken wall remains, covered with camel thorns (a perennial shrub in the desert, thick and thick, with long and sharp thorns, which camels like to eat). Recently, I heard that a few warehouses were set up to store autumn grain, but I didn't see it. There are a few farm households on the east side of the road. It was very hot and thirsty. I bought water to drink, which was soaked in fennel. It is said that it is easy to get bloated in the desert summer, and drinking this tea can prevent epidemics. They firmly refused to accept the money I gave them. Twenty li further, I arrived at "Liugong". The weather was extremely hot, and I could not continue. I planned to find a place to stay, but people everywhere scattered, which was quite strange. I caught sight of a woman lying on the roof of a house and finally asked where the village chief was and went to stay there. The farmland in the village is calculated by household, with each household having about 60 mu. Each year, they pay three dan of wheat grain. Other tobacco tax, fines, and miscellaneous taxes and expenses are paid an uncertain number of times a year, and the amount varies. Ordinary clear water fields used to be more valuable than mountain water fields. Now, because the clear water fields pay three times more than the mountain water fields, families with fields would rather send them to others to cultivate and subsidize cattle carts, but only ask them to bear the grain tax. However, no one dares to accept it. Ma Zhongying once arrested 70 farmers here, and later each family spent 20 to 30 yuan to redeem 32 people. Those who had no money to redeem were all taken to Xinjiang and have not returned to this day. Therefore, the villagers</p>

<p>Are extremely lacking. I set off from Liugong at six o'clock in the morning and entered the Gobi Desert, traveling along the south side of the small mountain for 70 li without seeing a tree or encountering a person. In ancient times, it was said, "I don't know where to stay tonight, there is no human smoke for thousands of miles in the flat desert," which can be used as a portrayal. There is a strange scene in the Gobi: from a distance, the blue air seems to be trapped in the sea, and the inverted shadows of mountains, rocks, and vegetation are in it, and some are floating in the sky. They appear and disappear, like sharks but not sharks. The illusion of a mirage is no more than this. As the car slowly advances, it moves leisurely to other places, step by step attracting people into the scenic spots, making them overwhelmed. Some say that this is the origin of the name "瀚海" (Han Hai). Others say that it is a phenomenon of miasma in the Gobi. In fact, it is a result of the difference in the density of air and the refraction of light. Near noon, the scorching sun is steaming, the artemisia grass is haggard, the color is green, and it shatters when touched. Dozens of gazelles flee from the left and right in groups, and their agility is unmatched. In the blink of an eye, they disappear into the distance. It is said that as soon as they fall to the ground, they can walk as well as their mothers as soon as their hair is dry, and the same is true for wild horses and wild camels (also known as single-humped camels). Therefore, in the land of mixed wolf and bear, they can still breed and reproduce. On the first two days of my trip from Anxi, it happened that Regiment Commander Ma returned from hunting and left me a gazelle with a firm and sharp horn that grew high on the head and bent slightly forward, unlike the cattle and sheep whose horns bay down on both sides (females have no horns). I was suffering from not knowing how to cook it, when County Magistrate Xie suddenly invited me to taste this thing. The meat is coarse and slightly grassy, ​​which does not seem as good as domestic lamb.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Tianshui Well, I saw many parked ox carts, either carrying melons, fruits, and grains, or carrying gypsum, fur, all of which were traveling at night and resting here, about to go to Anxi. There is only an ancient temple and a store here, specializing in watching the well water, which can get two buckets of wheat per month. The taste of the well water is extremely bitter and salty. It can be barely palatable after boiling and drinking hot, but it is very difficult to swallow when cold, and it is easy to get diarrhea after drinking it, so it is called "sweet water", which implies a meaning of begging and hoping. Yesterday, Secretary Du Jingshan kindly gifted me two bottles of canned fruit, which I firmly refused, but to no avail. Now, they are put to great use. After resting until four o'clock in the afternoon, the car continued to move forward. The road was still the Gobi. As the red sun set in the west, I encountered more than a dozen large carts in a row, and arrived at Gedagang Well and stayed overnight at midnight, traveling sixty or seventy li. Although the well water here is slightly better, there is nothing else except for a store. A certain traveler passed by here, unable to find food, and actually wrote the sentence "Tighten your belly and rush to Dunhuang" on the wall.</p>
<p>I set off on the third day and met a Taoist who had fled from Guchengzi, saying that since Ma Zhongying disrupted Guchengzi, the price of grain (the common name for grain prices in Gansu) has been high, and the locals are grabbing food, making it difficult to make a living, so he fled to Guan Nei. When the reporter passed through Suzhou, I saw a letter from a missionary who had just been sent to Xinjiang by the Catholic Church, which was even worse than what the Taoist said. However, he did not give up and continued to move forward, while the monks and Taoists of our country retreated into Guan Nei. In contrast, how can courage and cowardice be tolerated? Twenty li later, I passed a large salt lake of more than ten li in circumference, which naturally turned into salt. Looking from a distance, it looked like accumulated snow. The nearby residents freely take food. Forty li west of Dunhuang City, there is a Xiyanchi. This is Dongyanchi. There are two roads in the pool. The north road goes straight through the center of the pool. It can be walked on when it is frozen, and the journey is 10 miles shorter. The south road goes around the lake, and can be walked in all seasons. The road is 10 li longer. Xinhuzi is west of the lake and is 30 li from Gedagang. The two places look at each other, as if only a stone's throw away, but the route is deviated and the reeds are luxuriant, so people cannot go there. The walls of the houses in the city are connected to each other, the market is noisy, and the prosperity of commerce is only seen from Liangzhou in the west.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Chairman Chiang Returns to Jiangxi from Taiyuan via Wuhan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Soong Mei-ling and Kung Hsiang-hsi Depart for Nanjing</p>
<p>Yang Yung-tai and Others Travel South by Train</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states: Chairman Chiang, having previously traveled north of the Han River, inspected the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi. This lasted for over a month. Along the way, he summoned local military and government officials and addressed the masses. He received a warm welcome. After meeting with Yan Xishan in Taiyuan for several days, and because the campaign against the bandits in Jiangxi was progressing smoothly and the remaining bandits had fled their nests, Chiang urgently needed to return to Jiangxi to arrange for their pursuit and suppression. Coincidentally, a giant airplane from the Eurasia Aviation Corporation was inspecting the Northwest air route and passed through Taiyuan. He took the plane at 9:00 AM on the 11th to return to Jiangxi via Wuhan. He was accompanied only by his chief bodyguard, Ding Luwu, his secretary, Wang Rizhang, and three adjutants. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, and his deputy manager, a Westerner named Jie Peng, also came south on the plane. Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling and Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi returned directly to Nanjing from Taiyuan. Secretary-General Yang Yung-tai and all the accompanying staff and guards took the train at 2:00 PM on the same afternoon to Shijiazhuang, and then traveled south on the Pinghan Railway. As Chairman Chiang's departure was abrupt, the military and government agencies here had not received any prior notification. In the afternoon, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and Director He Chengjun received a telegram from Yang Yung-tai, stating briefly that the Chairman had flown to Jiangxi from Taiyuan at 9:00 AM that morning, but did not mention whether he would stop in Wuhan. At 3:30 PM, the giant Eurasia airplane arrived in Wuhan and landed at Wangjiadun Airport. After disembarking, Chiang originally intended to rest briefly before flying directly to Nanchang on the same plane. However, he received a telegram from Jiujiang reporting that the weather was unfavorable. They then went to Deming Hotel for lunch. Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, Chairman Zhang Qun, Commander Qi Peng, Mayor Wu Guozhen, and Director Chen Xihui successively came to pay their respects. At the same time, the Yong Sui warship was notified to raise steam and sail from the Jiangmian River in Wuchang Huijia Lane to the Sanbei Wharf to await orders. Chairman Chiang received each person individually and inquired in detail about military and government affairs. At 10:00 PM, he took a car to the Sanbei Wharf to board the ship. Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Qian Dajun, Qi Peng, Wu Guozhen, Chen Xihui, Cai Mengjian, Li Jihong, Qiu Kaiji, and Tang Guozhen boarded the ship to see him off. The police department, public security bureau, and military police provided strict security along the route and at the wharf. Sailors from the Yong Sui warship also went ashore to assist. After Chiang got out of the car, he walked to the ship, thanking the people who were seeing him off and saying that there was no need for them to board the ship. After a while, as the ship was about to depart, Chiang reappeared on the deck, smiling and urging Deputy Commander Zhang and others to return early. At 10:15 PM, the ship set sail eastward. The people who were seeing him off gradually dispersed. The water journey to Xunyang is about 18 hours, and it is estimated that he will arrive in Xunyang at 4:00 PM on the 12th, and then take a car to Nanchang. Liu Xiang, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in Sichuan, had originally planned to come east to meet with Chiang. The location was originally set in Hankou, but it has now been changed to Nanchang. Liu will take a plane to Hankou in the next day or two, and then transfer to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang to earnestly discuss with Chairman Chiang the issue of pacifying Sichuan and suppressing bandits.

<h3 id="e78">Japanese Troops in Malanyu to Withdraw Soon <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Our Security Forces Prepare to Take Over</p>
<p>Difficulties in the Takeover Have Been Overcome</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states: The issue of taking over the Eastern Mausoleums in Malanyu seems to be nearing fruition. According to news from Malanyu a few days ago, the commander of the Japanese regiment stationed there, Miyama, convened a meeting of the responsible parties of the puppet army in the Eastern Mausoleums and local gentry to discuss the withdrawal issue. It was decided that the puppet army in the Eastern Mausoleums would begin to withdraw from yesterday (the 9th) and would complete the withdrawal by the 13th. Miyama himself is scheduled to host a farewell banquet for leaders of various agencies and local gentry tonight (the 10th). The Japanese army has also decided to withdraw outside the pass when our security forces enter to take over. The date for our security forces to enter the Eastern Mausoleums in Malanyu has been roughly set for the 13th. Whether there will be any temporary changes is currently difficult to say. However, it is more reliable that the difficulties in the takeover of the Eastern Mausoleums in Malanyu have been completely overcome. Only the handover procedures may be sooner or later.</p>
<p>After the Eastern Mausoleums are taken over by our side in the future, the issues within the war zone can be said to be entirely matters of cleaning up. It is said that the cleaning-up procedure will prioritize the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants. The Japanese side has long agreed to crack down on Japanese and Korean vagrants, as most of the disputes in the war zone are caused by Japanese and Korean vagrants. There are many such cases in the past. If all the Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone can abide by the law, then all administrative construction in the war zone can proceed in an orderly manner, and there will be no reason for unnecessary disputes to arise. Therefore, after the establishment of the War Zone Cleanup Committee, it is currently preparing everything and will begin to proceed after the handover of the mausoleums. Su Mi District Commissioner Yin Rugeng visited Gubeikou on the 5th of this month to inspect the traffic conditions in the counties under his jurisdiction, together with Huo Shi, the director stationed in Gubeikou, and then went to Baimalan, Qiangzilukou, Caojialu, and other passes for inspection. After returning to Beiping, he told reporters this morning (the 10th) that about 20 li of the Great Wall between Baimaguan and Caojialu was demolished in the past due to the feng shui of the Eastern Mausoleums. Now, due to the so-called [Great Wall Line] relationship, it is necessary to survey it. Since it is called [Great Wall Line], the original city base should be the standard. When Yin talked about the Eastern Mausoleums takeover issue, he briefly stated that there was no problem with the takeover, and the date could be finally determined after meeting with Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy. According to further investigation, Yin Rugeng and Shibayama will go to Malanyu around the 14th at the latest. Representatives from all parties of the Eastern Mausoleums Management Committee will depart within days and gather in Malanyu to participate in the takeover ceremony and begin work. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi Suddenly Attacked in Tianjin <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Gunfire Suddenly Erupts Amidst a Game of Mahjong</p>
<p>Liu Shaoliang Killed, Ji and Ren Slightly Injured</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin states: A bizarre homicide suddenly occurred at the Guomin Hotel in the French Concession of Tianjin at 7:50 PM on the 9th. Liu Shaoliang died on the spot, and Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi were also attacked and injured at the same time. They were sent to the French Hospital for treatment. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>On the 31st of last month, a traveler came to the Guomin Hotel. A tea attendant led him to room 38 on the third floor. When registering in the hotel register, the traveler claimed to be Xu Jiyun from Beiping. After arriving at the hotel, he had many friends coming and going every day, and he often played mahjong. On the 9th, Xu Jiyun asked the tea attendant to move from room 38 to room 45 on the third floor. In the afternoon, he invited Ji Hongchang, Ren Yingqi, and Liu Shaoliang to gather in room 45, playing cards and chatting. Unexpectedly, at 7:55 PM, there were six or seven gunshots inside. Liu Shaoliang was shot several times in the head on the spot. Ji Hongchang was also shot in the right arm, and Ren Yingqi was shot in the hand. Liu fell to the ground and died due to the severity of his injuries. Ji Hongchang was less seriously injured. Gao Hongwen, the tea attendant on duty on the third floor, shouted loudly while chasing the murderer. At that time, Xu Jiyun also tried to go downstairs, but was stopped by Li Mingxin, the hotel manager. He immediately reported to the French Municipal Council. Many Chinese and foreign detectives arrived and carried the deceased Liu Shaoliang to the Xikai mortuary. The injured Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi were carried to the Xikai French Hospital for treatment. Xu Jiyun was taken to the bureau for questioning. According to Li Mingxin, the hotel manager, Xu Jiyun made two long-distance calls to his home in Beiping this afternoon (the 9th). His home telephone number is South Bureau 1404, and he lives on Tianma Temple Street in Beiping. This information was obtained from the Beiping telephone directory. When the incident occurred, I heard gunshots downstairs and rushed upstairs. At this time, the tea attendant Gao Hongwen chased down and shouted, ["The person running downstairs with a gun is here!"]. While we were chasing, the gunman and another person escaped from the side door without a trace. Xu Jiyun was intercepted by me at this time. We do not know what Xu Jiyun's occupation is, nor do we know the motive for the murder, etc. It is said that after the injured Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi were taken to the French Hospital, they were treated by doctors, and their lives are not in danger. It is also said that Xu Jiyun is the manager of a Beiping asbestos company, and it is also reported that the murderer abandoned his gun on 25th Road when he fled. (10th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states: Pan Ji, the director of the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department, recently saw that the newly recovered bandit areas are becoming more and more extensive. He actively organized multiple medical rescue teams to be stationed in various places to handle disease prevention and relief matters. The first team of doctors, including Zhu Youzhang, has already departed and is stationed in Xingguo County. The second team of doctors, including Tian Zhenyuan, is stationed in Shicheng County. The third team of doctors, including Tu Qingchu, is stationed in Ningdu County. The fourth team of doctors, including Pan Fuyin, is stationed in Yiqian, Guangchang County. The fifth team of doctors, including Wang Guoxiong, is stationed in Xinan, Guangchang County. The sixth team of doctors, including Yang Yanxia, is stationed in Xiaosong, Shicheng County. The seventh team of doctors, including Chen Bingxie, is stationed in Yaoling, Ji'an County. There are still eight, nine, and ten teams being selected and organized to be ready to depart at any time for rescue and treatment. On the 8th of this month, Director Pan was also ordered to lead more than 20 technical personnel and doctors from the National Health Administration to inspect the rescue and treatment situation of the forward medical rescue teams in Xingguo, Shicheng, and Ningdu, and whether the stationed locations are appropriate, so as to deal with them accordingly. In addition, the Health Department has taken measures to prevent diphtheria, which has recently been discovered in the city. The First Clinic on Zhangjiang Road is providing free diphtheria vaccination for the general public to curb the spread of diphtheria.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Autumn Harvest Conference Held in This County Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th) at 2:00 PM, the autumn assessment conference was held in this county government. The attendees were County Magistrate Xu, various bureau chiefs, section chiefs, district chiefs, Yang Zichun from the county party department, Kui from the suspected property department, Wang Zuxun and Fan Zupei representing the landowners, and others. County Magistrate Xu presided over the meeting. Guan Rongceng from the Finance Department and Liu Jianguang from the Civil Affairs Department stated that the provincial government had decided to set the autumn harvest at 70%. The landowners argued that this year's drought in the county was severe, and the autumn harvest was less than 50%. The county government reported to the province that it was 57%, which was unsubstantiated, and requested the authorities to consider the situation and allow a reduction to provide relief. After repeated discussions, it was agreed that the autumn harvest this year would be 60%. However, the landowners were only willing to accept 57% and even left the meeting early, refusing to increase the percentage to show compassion.</p>

<p>Yuan Jigen, a boatman from the Shiyuan Rice Shop in the north, unloaded 400 bags of soybeans at the North Railway Station a few days ago. When he sailed to the Gongyun Bridge, the soybean bags were damaged by a stone boat coming from the west. Yu Meiquan, a member of Yuan's boat crew, negotiated with Xiong Yongxiang and others from the stone boat, which resulted in Yu being hit on the head. The suspects were detained and sent to the local branch court. However, Yu Meiquan died yesterday due to the severity of his head injury. Prosecutor Shen, accompanied by coroner Wang, went to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the death was caused by the beating. After the autopsy, they reported back to the Yinyunbu and awaited review.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Land Price Declaration Actively Underway <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since receiving the provincial order to postpone the declaration of land prices in Wuxi City for one month and approving the temporary suspension of land price tax collection, the office has been working very hard on land price declaration matters. In addition to setting a household-by-household declaration method and a work schedule, it is also limited to start from the 11th. The township heads and temporary staff were assigned to distribute declaration forms by district to implement household-by-household declaration, so as to complete all collections before the 30th of this month. Yesterday, the land price declaration office convened the township heads of the first district, as well as district staff such as Chen Songfu, and Jin Mahua, three instructors, to hold a conversation meeting in the county government conference room. 35 people attended the meeting. County Magistrate Yan gave a speech, stating briefly that the land price declaration is an important policy for land consolidation, and it is obviously two different things from the collection of land price tax. The provincial government has now clearly stated that it will postpone the land tax, and the purpose of the people's organizations has been achieved. Therefore, the land price declaration must be implemented without any doubt and should be promoted diligently so that it can be completed as soon as possible. There are several points that the staff should pay attention to: 1. The method of filling out the declaration form should be explained peacefully to the public. 2. If the district needs the assistance of the map, it can ask the county government to transfer the order for assistance if necessary. 3. If you encounter deliberate obstruction, you should report it to the county for severe punishment. He asked the staff to do the above three points well. Subsequently, the instructors gave separate instructions on how to fill out the declaration form and allocated the guidance time for each group. After the meeting, all the township staff set off to distribute the forms to the businesses for true reporting. Urban residents believe that during the period of political training, before the start of constitutional government, and the people have not enjoyed the four rights, Jiangsu Province is rushing to handle the land price declaration in Wuxi, which is obviously contrary to the Premier's will. Therefore, Hua Yi, Wang Zhiru, and others, totaling 1,574 people, filed a lawsuit with the Executive Yuan and at the same time published a notice to seek assistance from all sectors of the country.</p>

<p>There has been no rain in the four townships of Xiaoshan this summer and autumn. The harvests have been hopeless. In areas with severe disasters, such as the third and sixth districts, the farmers have been unable to cook. Poor people and rural women are coming to the city in a steady stream, and the number of beggars is increasing day by day. The government authorities, in view of the severity of the disaster, telegraphed the province the other day to find ways to provide relief. Recently, the buckwheat planted by the sand people has flowered but not produced fruit, and the disaster is becoming more and more serious. Rice prices have risen sharply in recent days, and general vendors are mixing miscellaneous rice, causing the poor to suffer.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Various Circles Held a Commemorative Meeting for the Premier's Birthday Yesterday <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>City Flags and Agency Offices Closed</p>
<p>More Than 500 Representatives Attended the Meeting</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, various circles in this city specially held a commemorative meeting for the Premier's birthday in the assembly hall of the Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge. More than 500 representatives from various agencies, groups, and schools attended. The meeting did not end until 12:00 noon. The whole city hung flags to celebrate, and all agencies were closed for one day. All schools and factories also had a day off. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Order 1. Ringing the bell to start the meeting; 2. All stand in silence; 3. Sing the Party Song; 4. Pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flag and the Premier's Portrait; 5. Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; 6. Silence; 7. Chairman's report; 8. Speeches; 9. Shout slogans; 10. Ceremony complete, meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The representatives who attended the meeting included Li Zhixiang from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Ren'an from the Bar Association, Wang Zongjian from the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office, Zhang Menglin from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zheng Chengqing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Wang Hanyu from the United Association of Citizens of the First Special Zone, Huang Xianggu from the United Association of Citizens of the Second Special Zone, and Yu Yaoqiu and others representing the trade unions of Southern Goods, Musical Instruments, Textiles, Rubber, and Bookbinding industries, as well as more than 500 representatives from various schools and party departments at all levels.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report The presidium consisted of Wang Yansong (Municipal Party Department), Zhang Yuanruo (Municipal Government), Tao Chengqing (Municipal Chamber of Commerce), Zhou Xuexiang (General Union), Yu Hui (Municipal Farmers' Association), and Xu Zexu (Educational Association). After performing the ceremony, Chairman Tao Baichuan gave a report, stating briefly that the Premier was born in Cuiheng Village 46 years before the founding of the Republic of China. In his 61 years of life, the Premier lived every day in wind and rain, even in storms. The Premier studied medicine at a young age and used his medical career to promote revolution. Later, the number of revolutionaries increased, and the Premier became more motivated to organize parties and groups to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. Although the environment at the time was so bad and difficult, it was the Premier's great spirit that enabled him to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. However, after the founding of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor and Zhang Dong attempted to restore the monarchy in the past, and warlords usurped national power in the future, making the Premier's proposals difficult to implement. Later, during the period when Duan Qirui was in power, there was a move to convene a National Assembly. The Premier went to Beijing to participate, but unfortunately passed away in Beijing. We can draw the following conclusions from the Premier's life's work: 1. The Premier lived every day in storms, and his spirit of striving to overcome obstacles never wavered. 2. There was not a single day of mediocrity in the Premier's revolutionary process, and his revolution was not for himself or his family, but to seek the birth of freedom for China, the birth of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the birth of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Speeches from Various Circles Chapter Yuanruo delivered a speech, stating briefly that the chairman had reported in detail on all the Premier's doctrines, theories, and spirit. I have some thoughts to report to you: 1. It was the birth of the Premier that led to the birth of the Republic of China. Although the Premier is dead, the Republic of China will never die because of it. The Premier's doctrine and spirit still exist and should be further promoted and expanded. However, the significance of the Premier's birthday is so great, but the general public seems indifferent on the day of commemoration. Not only that, but some people advocate high-profile criticisms, thinking that the current Kuomintang has become religionized, holding commemorative weeks every week, and holding commemorative meetings from time to time. It is important to know that all countries in the world must have several enthusiastic commemorations every year, such as Christmas, which all countries celebrate enthusiastically to commemorate it. Now people in our country are also emulating this practice, but they are indifferent to the Premier's birthday, which is a manifestation of the difficult and morbid state of the Chinese nation. The Premier said that power arises from thought. In the future, we should unify our thoughts and show a kind of power. On this occasion of the Premier's birthday, we should enthusiastically raise our interest to celebrate it. 2. The greatness and profundity of the Premier's teachings should be understood by everyone. Today, the Chinese people have a considerable understanding of the Premier's teachings, but it is limited to a few. According to the Premier's teachings, it can be divided into two types: 1. The origin of thought, such as the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. 2. The application of thought, such as knowing is difficult and doing is easy, and the preliminary stage of civil rights. This is to enable practical application. Therefore, in the future, the Chinese people should not only understand all the Premier's theories, but also do it down-to-earth with the spirit of revolution. There is also Wang Hanliang's speech, the words are omitted.</p>
<p>Slogans and Taglines [Slogans] 1. All compatriots across the country unite; 2. Resist foreign aggression and wash away national humiliation; 3. Eliminate the Red bandits and appease the refugees; 4. Actively develop the Northwest; 5. Support the Chinese Kuomintang; 6. Support the National Government; 7. Support the Five-Power Congress; 8. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; 9. Long live the Republic of China; [Taglines] 1. The Premier is the savior of the Chinese nation and the human race in the world; 2. The Premier's birthday is a memorial day for the development of the new life of the Chinese nation.</p>

<p>Last Night, a Banquet at the International Hotel for All Sectors</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu, a prominent overseas Chinese merchant from Southeast Asia, returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the previous evening and went directly to the Municipal Government Reception Center on Avenue Foch for rest. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, he visited the Kang Yuan Canning Factory, the Vagrant Training Center, and the Guangci Poorhouse Orphanage. At 12:00 PM, he attended a luncheon at the Hua'an Building hosted by the Yongding Fellow-Villagers Association of Fujian. In the afternoon, he visited the A. P. O. L. (Apcar) Light Bulb Factory, where he was personally received by Hu Xiyuan. After leaving, he visited the China Economic Credit Cooperative on Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road) before returning to his residence to rest. In the evening at 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for all sectors at the International Hotel. Among those present were Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, Wu Yun Chu, Du Yuesheng, Li Du, Mi Chunlin, Lu Bohong, Lin Kanghou, Hu Xiyuan, Yan Fuqing, Wang Yiting, Li Denghui, Pan Gongzhan, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Liande, Liu Zhanen, Shen Pengfei, Ma Yinliang, Shao Yizhi, Qu Wenliu, Yang Meinan, Li Dachao, Teng Baiye, Wang Jiyuan, and Jiang Xiaojian, totaling over 300 people.</p>
<p>Midway through the banquet, Li Dachao delivered a two-point speech on behalf of Mr. Hu, stating that Mr. Hu was truly unworthy of the warm welcome he received from all sectors during this return to China. He felt very honored to have personally witnessed the construction of Shanghai and the thriving enterprises in Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places. The impression he gained was extremely good, and he felt that China was now embarking on a new path of construction. Although he resides abroad, he will do his best to assist as much as he can. He is currently preoccupied with important matters in Singapore and Hong Kong and cannot bid farewell to everyone individually, so he hopes for their understanding. Following this, Wang Yiting rose to thank Mr. Hu on behalf of all the guests and proposed a toast to Mr. Hu's health. The banquet concluded harmoniously at around 10:00 PM. Mr. Hu is scheduled to return to Hong Kong this morning at 8:00 AM on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso. At 7:30 AM, he will board a specially prepared vessel from the Harbor Quarantine Station at the Xinguang Wharf to board the ship. Among those seeing him off are Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, Hu Xiyuan, and Wu Liande, who will also commission a statue of Mr. Hu to commemorate the occasion. The following are telegrams exchanged with various provincial authorities after Mr. Hu's tour of Beijing and Hangzhou:</p>
<p>Reply to Zhang Xueliang Mr. Hu Wenhu, the overseas Chinese philanthropist, accepted the invitation of President Wang to visit Beijing. Mr. Hu arrived in Beijing at 7:00 AM on the 9th, and those who welcomed him included representatives from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and various institutions and organizations. After Mr. Hu shook hands with everyone, he boarded a car provided by the Executive Yuan, accompanied by the welcoming representatives, to pay respects at Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s Mausoleum and the Tan Tomb. He then visited the sports field before returning to the Central Hotel to rest. Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs and Director Liu of the Ministry of Health both visited Mr. Hu. He was informed in detail about the situation in the bandit-controlled areas of Yongding, Fujian, and the suffering of the people. Minister He was requested to telegraph the military authorities in Fujian to pay attention to improvement, and Minister He agreed to do so. Mr. Hu then had Hu Zhugeng, representing various reporters, give a brief interview. On the evening of the 9th, Mr. Hu received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang Hanqing of the Beijing Office of the Military Affairs Commission's Northern Branch, forwarding his telegram and reply, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Zhang's Telegram) Mr. Hu Wenhu, esteemed sir: Your esteemed self has returned from overseas, and I am extremely eager to extend a welcome. I would be especially pleased if you would reside at my humble residence. However, I am ashamed of the simple facilities and hope that you will find a small space sufficient, no different from being at home. I earnestly hope for this. As for daily conveniences, I have instructed Mr. Mi Ruifeng to pay special attention. Respectfully, Zhang Xueliang of the North.</p>
<p>(Hu's Telegram) Esteemed Deputy Commander Hanqing: I received your respectful telegram forwarded by Mr. Mi Ruifeng, and I am deeply grateful for your kind attention from afar. I feel uneasy about the various disturbances caused by residing at your esteemed residence. I have already met with Mr. Mi and had a pleasant conversation. I am writing this note to inform you of my thoughts and to express my gratitude. Respectfully, Hu Wenhu.</p>
<p>Reply to Shao Lizi Mr. Hu replied to Shao Lizi, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, expressing his gratitude for his thoughtful remembrance from afar. He mentioned that he had long desired to visit the Northwest but was unable to do so due to weather and time constraints, which he deeply regretted. He had long heard of Mr. Shao's virtuous governance overseas and would certainly seek his guidance when the opportunity arose. He respectfully replied by telegram, hoping for his kind consideration.</p>

<p>Naming Ceremony of the New King on the 15th</p>
<p>No Ceremony Held in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Jules de Leurquin, will accompany his wife south to Beijing today as the new Belgian King Leopold III celebrates his first naming day anniversary (i.e., National Day) on the 15th of this month. (According to Belgian custom, the monarch's birthday is not observed as National Day, but rather the date of his naming.) They are expected to arrive in the capital tonight, so that on that day, he can host Chinese and foreign guests at the Belgian Embassy in Nanjing to receive congratulations. Afterwards, he will leave Beijing for Shanghai on the 16th. It is reported that the Shanghai Embassy Office and the Consulate General will not hold any ceremonies on that day, only raise the Belgian flag and close for a day of rest. King Leopold III, now 33 years old, is the eldest son of the late King Albert and succeeded to the throne on February 21 this year, after his father died climbing the mountain of Namur and his mother Queen Astrid was killed. Queen Astrid, formerly a Swedish princess, married in 1926 and had two sons and one daughter. The eldest, Princess Josephine Charlotte, was born in Brussels, Belgium, on October 1, 1927. The two sons, the elder named Baudouin, is four years old, and Albert is only one year old. The new king's sister is the current Crown Princess of Italy, and his brother, Charles, is 30 years old and holds the title of Count of Flanders.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Shi Zhiquan to Depart for Overseas to Study Judicial Affairs on the 17th <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Mr. Shi Zhiquan, former Vice Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, has been ordered to go abroad to study judicial affairs. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the night before last to prepare for his departure and has decided to take the Japanese ship Taiyo Maru to Japan on the 17th to study that country's judicial administration as a model for improving China's own judicial system. He is expected to return to China at the end of the year. He will be accompanied by Hong Wenlan, Director of the Judicial Administration Department, and Zhang Yuhai, an editor from the same department. According to Mr. Shi, he had previously taught at various universities in Beijing, leading a leisurely life. However, after taking a position in the Ministry of Law two years ago, he found the official duties overwhelming and felt that his personal energy was insufficient. He sought to resign for rest. He is grateful for the understanding of the President of the Court, who approved his resignation and ordered him to take advantage of his leisure time to go abroad to study judicial affairs. Mr. Shi also believes that traveling abroad would benefit his body and mind, as well as increase his knowledge, so he readily agreed. If he gains anything in the future, he can also contribute it to the country as reference material. He plans to go to Japan first because Japan has enacted new laws in recent years that China does not have, and many of its old laws have also been revised. It is necessary to carefully study the results of their implementation in order to understand their advantages and disadvantages. Vice President Tan has already gone to study European and American countries, so Mr. Shi does not need to go to Europe and America again.</p>
<h3 id="e96">6th National Exhibition Opens Yesterday Morning <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun's Speech: To Save the Nation, First, We Must Strengthen the Economy</p>
<p>The Temporary Market Will Open Today Due to Incomplete Arrangement</p>
<p>The Shanghai 6th National Products Movement Exhibition, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, held its opening ceremony at the Penglai Market in Xiaoximen at 10:00 AM yesterday. The temporary market will begin business today because the arrangement is not yet complete.</p>
<p>The Agenda of the Meeting: (1) Opening; (2) Music; (3) All Stand; (4) Presidium in Place; (5) Pay the Highest Respect to the National Flag and the Portrait of the Premier; (6) Chairman Respectfully Reads the Will; (7) Silence; (8) Chairman's Speech; (9) Speeches by Various Bureau Directors; (10) Guest Speeches; (11) Chairman's Response; (12) Music; (13) Photography; (14) Adjournment.</p>
<p>The representatives who attended included representatives from all walks of life, Mayor's representative Yu Hongjun, Municipal Party Department representatives Zhang Dafu and Xing Wan, Garrison Command Li Douchu, Security Office Wang Zhicheng, Yang Hu's representative Hui Zesheng, Finance Bureau Yuan Fang, Public Utilities Bureau Director Xu Peihuang, Public Works Bureau Jiang Sanping, Land Bureau Chen Jixi, Public Security Bureau Feng Shuju, Education Bureau Jiang Jianbai, Postal Administration Shen Lindan, Municipal Farmers' Association Ye Yi, Women's National Products Annual Meeting Lin Kecong, Citizens' National Products Promotion Association Wang Jiean and Xu Chengrou, and manufacturers' representatives and guests from all walks of life, totaling hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Hongjun, Xu Peihuang, Li Douchu, Xing Wan, and Wang Jiean of the Presidium. After the ceremony was carried out as planned, Yu Hongjun first delivered a speech on behalf of Wu Tiecheng, saying that today is the opening of the 6th National Products Exhibition and that because Mayor Wu is holding a memorial service for the Premier's birthday at the Municipal Government in the city center, he will give a brief report on behalf of his brother. Holding a national products exhibition is the foundation for mutual cooperation. Now that the country is in trouble and the people's livelihood is declining, we must cultivate vitality in order to save the situation. Empty talk will not succeed. All countries in the world are currently engaged in competition and are looking forward to the outbreak of war. Political activities are very vigorous, and the outward development of trade is even more fierce. They dump overproduced goods into China. All countries in the world regard China as the best market, which is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, to save the country, it is not enough to talk about economic strength. To strengthen economic strength, we must promote national products so that money does not flow out. In the past, cosmetics alone drained hundreds of thousands of yuan. It is conceivable that other items also do this. To relieve the rural areas, we must reject foreign goods. Holding a national products movement to make the people of the whole country understand national products is not just about holding an exhibition once a year. Please pay attention to the manufacturers to compare the goods of the past five years with today's goods to see if there has been any progress and urge improvement. Many Chinese products are more expensive than foreign goods and of inferior quality. I hope that we will work together to improve the quality and lower the price so that they can compete with foreign goods without failing and encourage each other to save the country.</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang's Speech Public Utilities Bureau Director Xu Peihuang gave a speech, briefly saying that the meaning of promoting national products is very profound. No matter what you do, you must think from a small perspective. If you promote national products yourself, you must want others to use national products as well. You must gradually persuade relatives and friends, and then let relatives and friends persuade their relatives and friends, and you can gradually succeed. Today's national products exhibition is already the sixth one. The results of the previous five years seem to be very few because the public often takes using foreign goods as the main body and national products as the object, thinking that foreign goods are of good quality and low price. Now we must change this mentality. The first point is to strengthen our strength and study the quality, and appropriately reduce the price, focusing on small profits. The second point is to improve the goods so that buyers can see at a glance and there is no suspicion of mixing fish eyes with pearls. The third point is to cooperate with the government when the people's livelihood is declining so that the people can support themselves to buy national products and concentrate their economy to cope with the crisis. Finally, Jiang Jianbai, a representative of the Education Bureau, and Wang Jiean, etc., gave speeches, which are not recorded due to their length.</p>

<p>Passive Resistance to the Influx of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>The Industrial Society says that since the emergence of the kneeling petition group in Shanghai, it has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. The members of this group persuade the people of the country not to buy foreign goods every day along the streets, and their work is very diligent. The reporter of the Industrial Society has received several letters from the members of the group reporting the progress of the work in great detail. Their patriotic enthusiasm and painstaking efforts are indeed commendable. A certain Mr. Wang, also a member of the kneeling petition group, knelt down at about 2:00 PM yesterday next to the Dongshengxiang fur shop in Fangbang Street, East Gate, and begged a vendor, a certain Mr. Yang, who was setting up a stall selling inferior goods, telling him that foreign goods are flooding our country's market and that if the people of the country do not quickly repent, the national situation will be even more precarious. For a time, passers-by gathered to watch, blocking the road. After listening to him, the vendor Mr. Yang discovered his conscience and said that engaging in this kind of business was really a last resort, otherwise he would starve to death. In the future, he will try his best to find a way and will not do this kind of business again for the time being, in order to fulfill the duty of a citizen. Member Wang then thanked him and left. He then passed by Dacheng Road near the Temple of Confucius, when he happened to see a modern woman with coiled hair, high heels, leather shoes,盛装艷服 dressed in full foreign goods, coming slowly from the west. When the member saw her, he stepped forward, knelt down on both knees, and cried to the woman, explaining his intention. The woman, seeing this uninvited guest, whose behavior was strange, was greatly shocked, suspecting that he was a madman pretending to be insane. After listening to him, she realized that he was advising her not to wear foreign goods. However, the woman not only did not know how to repent, but also said loudly, "Wearing foreign goods is my freedom, what business is it of yours?" The member was still kneeling and refusing to get up, earnestly persuading and stopping the woman from leaving, not stopping until she repented. At that time, while it was in a state of commotion, a certain Mr. Hu, a student from Fudan University, happened to pass by. He immediately stepped forward to explain to the woman on behalf of member Wang. The woman then knew that she was in the wrong and at a loss for words, blushing and replying, "I will not wear foreign goods again next time." At this time, member Wang stood up, thanked her, and left.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Kuang Zhongmou Sued by His Wife <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Lawsuit for Unpaid Deposits of Over 20,000 Taels</p>
<p>Husband and Wife for Many Years Actually Meet in Court</p>
<p>Kuang Says He Did Evil in His Previous Life and Will Not Do Evil in This Life</p>
<p>Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of Penglai Market in this city, was recently sued in the local court by his second wife, Kuang Huiyueying, represented by lawyers Yu Sunxiu and Huang Tao, for failing to pay deposits of 28,000 taels of silver. Before the lawsuit proceeded, although relatives and friends came forward to mediate, the conditions of both parties were difficult to reconcile, so the husband and wife of many years inevitably met in court. After receiving the complaint, the court has commissioned Fu Xunwei to complete the investigation; the settlement is pending and further out-of-court conciliation has been arranged. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Pang Shurong specially opened the first court to hear the case. Both the plaintiff and the defendant arrived in court with their lawyers. First, Kuang Huiyueying testified that the 28,000 taels of silver she deposited with the defendant's Asia Eastern Company, opened under the name of Pei Ji, was not paid back, so she requested a lawsuit of 150 yuan, later increased to 250 yuan due to insufficient expenses until July of the 15th year of the Republic. After that, she stopped managing it and he managed the meals himself. Question: Was your money used as the profits of the Asia Eastern Company? In the fifth year of the Republic, the profits were over 20,000 gold, in the sixth year the profits were 120,000 gold, and by the public year, the profits reached 420,000 gold. Because I followed him to do business, I had taken out 5,000 taels from the deposit book. Next, Kuang Zhongmou testified that this Pei Ji deposit book belonged to him. All the rent until the Bingyin year was collected by her as household expenses, which could receive hundreds of yuan per month. Now this rent is collected by the accounting manager. Earlier, the plaintiff's uncle, Kuang, mediated and proposed to change the deposit in the book to Penglai Silver Company, and change the account name to Hui Yue Ji, and give the plaintiff 150 yuan of pocket money per month. He said that he could not accept this condition, so it was not resolved. The judge asked both parties, "You have been husband and wife for many years, and in the future, your money will belong to your son. Why bother with this lawsuit?" Kuang replied, "This is a matter of the previous life. I did evil in my previous life. It is difficult for me to fulfill one side of my family." The court ordered witnesses Zhang Jiuda and Ni Jingqi to the case. According to Zhang's testimony, after the reorganization of Asia Eastern Company in October of the sixth year of the Republic, he began to work as the deputy accountant in the company. The company was reorganized again in the ninth year of the Republic, and six shareholders withdrew, leaving only four shareholders. The company ended in the eleventh year of the Republic. In the seventh year of the Republic, the registered capital of the Hui Yue Ji account was 500 taels, and the profit dividend was 7,000 to 8,000 taels. Later, he went to Yingyou Company to work. Question: Do you know if there are registered accounts in Asia Eastern Company? Answer: He knows a thing or two about this matter. Kuang sold bonds and deposited it into the company. Lastly, according to Ni Jingqi's testimony, he entered Asia Eastern Company as the main accountant in the tenth year of the Republic. There were a total of four shareholders, and Kuang Zhongmou was the largest shareholder. The shares were split the following year. Question: Did the shareholders take out the dividends? Answer: They took it out. Question: What about Hui Yueying's 8,000 yuan? Answer: They took it out. Question: Was the deposit clear when the company ended? Answer: It was clear. Question: Does Asia Eastern Company have a Pei Ji deposit book? Answer: Yes, he had one, he was writing the book, there was a man surnamed Shen, who said to him, Kuang Guang said that he would give him a Pei Ji deposit book, this money was Mr. Kuang's own, it was the money he sold government bonds for. Question: What was the money used for? Answer: He was in charge of clearing accounts, and there were other people who managed the money in and out. Question: Did you also write the words "8% interest" on the book? Answer: Yes. The judge said that because there was still a need to call the owner for questioning in this case, it would be best to reach a settlement out of court and schedule another hearing. Then the court adjourned.</p>

She used to work at the nearby Dali Machine Factory. She was seduced into adultery by Zhao Xiren, a fellow worker from Anhui Province. On the 13th day of the first month of this year, A Duo secretly ran away from home behind her mother's back and was taken by Zhao to his hometown in Qixian County, Anhui Province, and hidden there. In June, her mother finally found out and entrusted Zhao's fellow villager, Wu Meigong, to go and find her, and entrusted him to bring clothes and travel expenses to Anhui, instructing Wu to invite A Duo to return to Shanghai together. When Wu arrived in Shexian County, A Duo was suffering from an epidemic due to the heat and died soon after. Wu returned to Shanghai alone and told A Duo's mother, Ding Xu, about the situation. Xu did not believe him and suspected that Wu and Zhao had colluded. She then hired attorney Ni Jiong to file a complaint with the criminal court of the Second Special District, accusing Zhao Xiren of seducing a minor girl and Wu Meisu of fraud. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned them for questioning and ordered Zhao to be detained and Wu to be released on bail. A document was sent to the Shexian County Government to investigate. Now, a reply has been received, confirming that Ding A Duo did indeed die of illness. Judge Xiong Huiping opened a court hearing and declared the case concluded, scheduling a sentencing date, which has been recorded in previous reports. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Xiong presided over the second criminal court and pronounced the verdict: Zhao Xiren was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment is confirmed will be used, with two days offsetting one day of imprisonment. Wu Meigong was found not guilty. During the appeal period, Zhao was still remanded to the detention center.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Reaction to Sand and Gravel Merchants Continuing to Use Private Baskets <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Barge Industry Association Petitions the Social Bureau to Correct the Practice</p>
<p>The Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association of this city submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau yesterday, stating: "Members of the association have reported that when barges carrying stones from various factories in Suzhou and Hangzhou arrive in Shanghai and are unloaded to brokers for settlement of tonnage, the amount of cargo is only 80% of the original ship's cargo. The loss is enormous. It has been found that the diameter of the basket used to be seven feet and one inch, but now it has been changed to seven feet and four inches, an increase of three inches. Such exploitation of barge owners should be quickly corrected to maintain business." Upon receiving the document, it was noted that the system of weights and measures has already been promulgated by the government to ensure a uniform system and avoid disputes. All industries should abide by the new system. According to the previous statement, it is evident that some sand and gravel merchants are still using private baskets to exploit barge owners and dare to openly violate the system of weights and measures and practice their deceptive tricks. In this time of economic downturn, barge owners can hardly bear such significant losses. It is appropriate to submit this document to your bureau for review and approval, to convene the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association on a regular basis, send responsible representatives to discuss corrective measures, and uniformly use the public scale and baskets to maintain commercial transportation.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Special Article: Several Fundamental Issues of the Chinese Constitution, Speech by Sun Zhesheng, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, Recorded by Fan Shiqin. <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Location: Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA</p>
<p>Date: 7 PM, November 3rd</p>
<p>Chairman, comrades, I am here today at the invitation of the YMCA to talk about the issue of the Chinese Constitution. I think we must first ask: Does China need a constitution? This is a prerequisite question. At the same time as asking if China needs a constitution, we must also ask if China needs to build a new country, a modern country. Then, the importance of the constitutional issue will naturally be felt by everyone.</p>
<p>(I) The Constitution and the Modern State</p>
<p>The constitutional issue has really been a central issue in China for decades. We now want to study how China can maintain itself, how it can survive in this era. Probably everyone agrees that if China can reform and become a modern country, it must have various conditions. In this way, China can maintain itself. The most important condition for a modern country is the condition of the rule of law. Whether in China or abroad, if a modern country is to be built, everyone must take the rule of law as the basic standpoint. Before and even now, China cannot be said to have become a country of the rule of law. For thousands of years, China has only been a country of rule by man. What is the result? Needless to say, it is very dangerous. If there is a wise monarch, the country will have peace and the people can live in peace. Otherwise, the country will be fundamentally shaken. As the saying goes, "When the man exists, the government thrives; when the man dies, the government ceases." China has been like this for thousands of years. This is a country of rule by man, not a country of the rule of law. The present country advocates the rule of law, because the rule by man is to fundamentally shake the later country, while the country of the rule of law is not like this. Whoever should abide by the law does not change due to the change of people. The difference between the country of the rule of law and the country of the rule by man lies in this. Then, whether China needs a constitution means whether China wants to become a modern country, whether it wants to become a country of the rule of law. If so, it must have a fundamental law, and the fundamental law is the constitution. Whether China needs a constitution is really not a problem. China's urgent need for a constitution is very easy to understand now. Otherwise, do not reform China into a modern country, a country of the rule of law. Or, do not save the country and seek survival. Then we can do without a constitution. If we want to organize a modern country, to save the country, we must make our country a country of the rule of law. Therefore, I will first make this prerequisite problem clear to you.</p>
<p>(II) The Establishment and Process of the Constitution</p>
<p>The constitution really comes with the revolution. When a country comes to a dead end, it must have a revolution, and it must have a new constitution. China is a revolutionary country. Although the work of the revolution has not yet been completed, the result of the revolution is to build the foundation of a new country. In foreign countries, whichever country has a constitution, either a written constitution or an unwritten constitution. The latter is like the British constitution. Although the United Kingdom has not yet written a written constitution in black and white, it has various basic conditions that determine it. This basic condition is based on the changes in British politics and hundreds of years of history, which is an unwritten constitution. Apart from the United Kingdom, the rest of the constitutional countries have written constitutions. Those written constitutions are mostly based on revolutions. After the revolution, there is a constitution, or the old constitution is overthrown by the revolution and a new constitution is established. The Chinese revolution has been going on for twenty-three years now, and the Chinese revolutionary movement has also had more than forty years of history. However, until now, China's constitution has not been determined. The reason is that the revolution has not yet succeeded, so a perfect constitution has not been established. Since the Republic of China, although there have been provisional laws, and Cao Kun's era even had a constitution, none of them had good results, precisely because the revolution had not yet succeeded.</p>
<p>If the constitution is not based on the revolution, the constitution has no foundation, because the constitution is the people's demand and the foundation of the country. The drafting of the constitution by the current Nanjing National Government is to determine the various original principles and policies of the National Revolution over the past decades, and the basic conditions for nation-building, as a one-time solution. The constitution drafting work has now been completed. The constitution reform case was passed by the Legislative Yuan in three readings two weeks ago. This draft constitution can be said to have been successfully promulgated as the constitution of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(III) The Issue of the National System</p>
<p>This draft constitution is based on the results of our Legislative Yuan's research and discussion over the past year. We feel that there are fundamental problems to be solved in drafting the constitution. These fundamental problems, first, are to determine what kind of country China is based on the history and theory of the revolution. The draft first stipulates that China is a country of the Three Principles of the People. This draft has been discussed and studied for one or two years before the Legislative Yuan decided on it.</p>
<p>Why is China a country of the Three Principles of the People? First, it is necessary to explain what the Three Principles of the People are, namely Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. The purpose of Nationalism is to make China a nation that is independent and not subject to the control of a second country or second nation. The purpose of Democracy is to make China a democratic country. The purpose of People's Livelihood is to improve the economic and social system, so that the people of the whole country have the right to survive. Taking these three principles as standards, China must use the Three Principles of the People to be established and the status of the country can be maintained, because the Three Principles of the People are the principles of the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang has created the Republic of China through decades of revolutionary movements, so the Republic of China cannot be separated from the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People. Now, many countries in Europe have provisions in this regard, saying that such and such a country is a certain nation's republic. This kind of regulation is the same as our regulation of the Three Principles of the People. For example, like Soviet Russia, it is a socialist country, with considerable performance in terms of people's livelihood, so its constitution stipulates that it is a socialist republic. China is a republic of the Three Principles of the People and cannot be changed. But it is not to say that China is now a republic of the Three Principles of the People. In fact, the Three Principles of the People have not been fully realized, and the Three Principles of the People's Xu Family has not been established. We are only saying that the Three Principles of the People can be established in China. In short, the purpose is to make China a nationally independent country, not subject to the oppression of foreign powers. The Chinese government is a public institution of the people, produced by the people, and also represents the people, guarantees the rights of the people, and can find solutions to China's poverty and bankruptcy. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People are our ideal purpose. Taking this ideal purpose and fundamental policy as the essence of the Chinese constitution to determine China's national system is really without doubt.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Seeking a Cold Job with a Cup of Tea, Obtaining Old Money to Discuss Expediency, Cunning Officials Colluding in Groups</p>
<p>Guo Dunpin sat down, took half a puff of his cigarette, held it between his fingers, gestured to Li Shilian, and shook his palm into a small circle. With a mouthful of smoke left in his throat, he said, "In a word, the rehabilitation donation is a very good source of income. Just handle a small part of it, and over a year, you can always talk about the number of squares." Before Li Shilian could answer, Jia Duocai called from outside the door, "Brother Shilian, are there guests here?" Shilian said, "It's okay, he's my fellow villager. Please come in." Jia Duocai came in and saw Guo Dunpin wearing an antique bronze-colored blue silk lined robe, with a blue serge vest on the outside, and a section of a silver watch chain showing from a small pocket. His face was thin, but somewhat swollen, with a pale complexion. A felt hat was placed on the table, which was his "ding" (official hat). The faint cyan gray color was very much like a half-wilted lotus leaf. From these, it could be seen that he had a special hobby. After Shilian introduced them, he learned that one was a banker and the other had returned from Gansu after handling tobacco and alcohol taxes. Jia Duocai smiled, "Just now I heard you say that some errand can earn tens of thousands of income. In a place like the Northwest, it's not easy to get such a lucrative position, right?" Guo Dunpin laughed, "Since Mr. Jia is in the banking industry, of course he knows what the Northwest produces. To levy taxes on the most valuable product, wouldn't there be a rich income?" Jia Duocai nodded and smiled, "I understand what you're saying. But there's one thing, there are naturally many people who want to obtain such a lucrative position. For someone like Li Shilian, who is new here, to want to engage in such a thing, I'm afraid it won't be easy, right?" Guo Dunpin threw away the cigarette held between his fingers, lit a new cigarette, and took a puff. He smiled, "I think things depend on human effort. Things in the world are not that difficult to handle. Take me for example, I don't have any acquaintances in Gansu, but I still managed to handle tax affairs in Gansu for more than two years."

<h3 id="e132">Wedding Fireworks <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Around the ninth and tenth months of the lunar calendar, probably because the climate is moderate at that time, many families choose auspicious days to marry their daughters; the people of Suzhou call it "Golden September, Silver October." Although customs for setting off fireworks at weddings may differ from place to place, everyone agrees that this is a way for the groom's family to show special respect to the bride. However, I think this is not just a way to show respect to the bride. Now let's talk about the situation of setting off fireworks in Taizhou and Shaoxing, and then add my assumptions to ask scholars who study folk customs for confirmation.</p>
<p>When a family in Taizhou marries a new bride, the sound of firecrackers is incessant. The new bride sits upright in the sedan, and people can stop her and judge her appearance at will. The sound of firecrackers must continue until the sedan arrives at the groom's house. In Shaoxing, the doorways of families with happy events often fire guns day and night. There is no fixed time or number of times for firing. Near where I live, a family has been having a happy event, and the sound of guns has not stopped for three days. In addition to the sound of guns, the sound of fine music can also be heard from time to time.</p>
<p>Studying the customs in these two places, I feel that setting off fireworks at weddings has at least some significance of ancient defense. Women are spoils of war. They can be plundered at will, which was a common occurrence among ancient tribes. The so-called "cannon" is also a tool for defense and guarding. Putting them together, the meaning is self-evident. When a family in Taizhou marries a new bride, the sound of firecrackers is incessant, which is a vestige of ancient vigilance. At that time, people feared that after plundering a woman, other tribes would come out to intercept, so they had to set off fireworks along the way. Similarly, in Shaoxing, families with happy events often fire guns in front of their doors, which is also a vestige of ancient vigilance. At that time, after people had plundered a woman and returned, they feared that the principal might be anxious and want to come and take her back; or they feared that others would be envious and want to come and rob her together. So they had to set off fireworks at the door from time to time.</p>
<p>The above is my guess, which is inevitably somewhat arbitrary, but it seems reasonable; I made this in the midst of the incessant sounds of guns nearby.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Strolling Through Wusong <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Nailing</p>
<p>Turning north from the right side of the newly built building on Waibaidu Bridge and coming down Tian Tong Road, you can find Wusong Road, which I am going to talk about now.</p>
<p>What is special about Wusong? You only need to ask your friends who wear Western suits, and you will know that it and Fujian Road, which specializes in buying Chinese-style old clothes, are "different songs with the same theme"; yes, Wusong Road is a place where shops that specialize in selling old Western-style clothes gather. Occasionally, there are a few pairs of old leather shoes on display, but you can't find old Chinese-style clothes no matter what. - If you want to buy old Chinese-style clothes, you can go to Fujian Road.</p>
<p>There are probably thirty to forty shops selling old Western clothes on Wusong Road. They hang oilskin coats and modern raincoats in front of their doors. Inside the shops, there are entire cabinets of old Western suits. Among these Western suits, there are distinctions of upper, middle, and lower grades. The upper grades are mostly the same as new, and the price is naturally expensive; for the middle grades, a full set of three pieces can be bought for sixteen or seventeen yuan; the lower grades can be bought for only seven or eight yuan.</p>
<p>When going to these second-hand shops, the first thing is to be able to recognize the goods. If you don't know the goods, you will buy a Western suit with the lining turned over as new. The second thing is to know how to bargain. According to custom, their prices are particularly high. For example, if you can sell it for ten yuan, he will say eleven yuan. You can only start bidding from six or seven yuan and slowly add it up to ten yuan. At this time, he can sell it to you.</p>
<p>Whenever it's the season change, like when you go to Wusong Road to take a stroll, you can see many modern young men picking out well-fitting clothes there!</p>

<p>— Original Author Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Every building has a special atmosphere, ordinary houses are like this, and palaces are also like this; the bedroom palace in Shengjing (Mukden) is certainly different from the bedroom palace in the Forbidden City in Beijing. When we first arrived, we inevitably felt unfamiliar; fortunately, the eunuchs who had been sent ahead were very capable. Through their efforts to rectify the situation, as many of the unique features as possible were corrected, and even those that could not be corrected were not very noticeable.</p>
<p>The main body of this bedroom palace is a main hall, a very high and large main hall; although its area is not comparable to the bedroom palace in the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is much larger than the one in the Summer Palace. On both sides of the main hall, there are two side halls arranged like two wings, forming an inverted U-shape. There is a long corridor connecting the side halls and the main hall. Its construction is also very exquisite, with glazed tiles on the top, which can also be used when it rains; but because the position of the corridor is in front of the hall, to get from the side hall to the main hall, or from the main hall to the side hall, you must first exit the hall door and then walk past the gallery. You cannot pass through the inside of the house. In this way, we can understand that in fact, the Empress Dowager's bedroom palace includes three separate buildings, rather than a continuous row of buildings.</p>
<p>We followed the Empress Dowager to the main hall first. Because this main hall has a large courtyard in front of it, there is plenty of light; the side halls on both sides are far apart, and they do not block the sunlight of the main hall at all, and they themselves can also get plenty of light. This method of construction can be said to be very suitable for hygiene - The Empress Dowager took a look and expressed great satisfaction; especially for the achievements displayed by the eunuchs who had been sent ahead, she was particularly happy. Inside this main hall, there are a total of three rooms: the central one is considered the Empress Dowager's study, and the old lady works and rests here. (172)</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Scrap Paper Collector <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>This is a true story worth recounting. I record it to substantiate this publication. The story is as follows:</p>
<p>One morning, a very slight commotion arose in our office. This was the beginning of the story.</p>
<p>The reason was a certain Western woman, named Kikauff. She was a female employee of our company. After she arrived at the office, she immediately said to the office boy in that department: [“Did you find my things? I forgot a package yesterday, containing a pair of high-heeled leather shoes and a gold watch, wrapped in newspaper. I put it in the wastepaper basket, intending to take it back when I left the office, but I forgot. Did you find it?”]</p>
<p>The office boy then asked the wastepaper collector who was in charge of clearing the wastepaper baskets in that department. According to the wastepaper collector: [“Indeed, I saw it. But I have seen similar paper packages before, but when opened, they turned out to be banana peels or other fruit shells. So, this time I threw it away without opening it.”]</p>
<p>Although he said so, she remained suspicious that the Chinese were [“dishonest”].</p>
<p>The next day, an old man in ragged clothes—the one who every morning carried away a pair of large baskets full of scrap paper from our company—came with a package. He happened to ask the office boy. He said: [“Yesterday, I found this package in the scrap paper pile, containing a gold watch and a pair of high-heeled leather shoes. Knowing it belonged here, I have come specially to return it.”]</p>
<p>Thereupon, the office boy led him to Kikauff. He handed the package to her, and when she opened it immediately, she was astonished to find the original items. She took only a single two-cent coin from her purse and gave it to the scrap paper collector, who left, seemingly disappointed. Therefore, people were quite critical of her stinginess.</p>
<p>Since this incident, the dignity of us Chinese has been invisibly elevated a level in their eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Wu Shuangre of Yushan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>In the late autumn of Jiangnan, I thought of the novelist Mr. Wu Shuangre from my hometown.</p>
<p>Shuangre, named Xu, was a native of Dongting Mountain in Suzhou, who had lived in Changshu for several generations. More than twenty years ago, he taught at the rice industry elementary school in the southern gate of Changshu. He mostly wore a black vest year-round. He was a kind of oriental humorist, with some humorous flavor in both his speech and writing. His well-known works included "Shuangre Jue Jin," "Happy Couple," etc. "Karma Mirror" was his masterpiece. Later, he taught at Zhengyi Middle School in Nanjing and Anhui Public School in Shanghai. In Changshu, he founded the "Qinxin Daily" and also published "After-Dinner Clock," which were writings for amusement. He had a long novel called "New Water Margin," which included all the people in Changshu who knew him. Unfortunately, it was not completed; otherwise, it could have been read as a local history of Changshu. He went to Guangdong with Xu Benxiao and worked for some "Datong Daily." Due to acclimatization issues, he suddenly returned. He also organized a "Shuangre Club," appearing on stage in theatrical roles, making fun of the world. Later, he began tutoring students in Chinese language, seeming somewhat resigned to old age. At the same time, he also served as a reviewer for the "Qin Daily," publishing Gongsun Jian's novels, and also edited the "Lightning" for telegrams. He was troubled for a long time and failed to develop his talents, and has already returned to the earth.</p>
<p>He was a bohemian celebrity, with one foot impaired, and people nicknamed him "Wu Bo," like Iron-Crutch Li. He and the literary figure Mr. Jiang Zhifan can be called a perfect pair, because one was Wu Bo and the other was Jiang Kuaqiao. Both of these individuals possessed a sense of humor. He was very polite to people, not at all like an old-fashioned person. With long hair and a beard, he resembled a romantic artist, often drinking tea in the Xiaoyao You teahouse in Changshu, and chatting daily with the late epigrapher Mr. Zhao Guni, enjoying humor. Since the passing of his mother, perhaps due to circumstances, he seemed somewhat depressed and gradually declined. Last autumn, he sent me a couple of letters, asking me to find him a teaching position in Suzhou with a monthly salary of sixty or seventy yuan. Unfortunately, I was not skilled in socializing and failed to fulfill his request. Thinking about it now, I feel I have failed his trust.</p>
<p>He wrote a "Record of Customs of Haiyu," describing from the first day of the year to New Year's Eve, a very interesting notebook. Now it is very difficult to find in the market of Changshu. After he died, his son, Xiao Re, advertised in the Changshu newspaper, seeking his writings, perhaps preparing to publish a memorial work. Whether it can be published is also a difficult question. I heard that Mr. Sun Yusheng, the Seaside Poet, was very close to him and specially visited him in Changshu one autumn, but unfortunately, he was still teaching at Zhengyi Middle School in Nanjing at that time!</p>
<p>I have very few of his writings here, only a few letters and two poems, one titled "Yushan Small Chronicle" and the other "Seashore Flute Sound." He promised to revise and comment on "Seashore Flute Sound" for me, but now it will not happen.</p>
<p>Some people said that he liked women with bound feet, but I dare not believe this. Perhaps people were joking with him!</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and as the plants of Jiangnan wither, I thought of a novelist with a sense of humor, who is already sleeping under the ground. Life is so fleeting, too quick!</p>

<h3 id="e158">Soviet Union's Illiteracy Eradication Campaign <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow TASS, October 7) The rapid reduction of illiteracy in the Soviet Union is one of the greatest achievements of socialism in recent years. From 1929 to 1933, the original 38 million illiterate people have now become literate. The illiteracy eradication campaign began during the Civil War, when Lenin ordered the organization of the National Extraordinary Committee for Illiteracy Eradication to carry out this work. The number of adult students in 1920-1921 was 1,158,000, while in 1932-33 it increased to 9,512,000. The table below shows the results of this campaign:</p>
<p>Year / Percentage of Literate People</p>
<p>1913 / 33.0</p>
<p>1920 / 44.4</p>
<p>1926 / 52.8</p>
<p>1932 / 90.0</p>
<p>Complete illiteracy has almost been completely eliminated. Today's work is to eliminate so-called semi-literacy. Women's education has developed extremely rapidly. In 1927-28, female students accounted for 39.5% of students in literacy schools. By 1932-33, they accounted for 58.3%. Among students in schools specifically set up for semi-literate people, women accounted for 39.1% in 1927-28 and 56.2% in 1922-33. The 1897 census indicated that only 13% of women were literate. The cultural level of ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union is increasing day by day. Currently, 68 ethnic groups use the new Latin alphabet. The number of literate people in Azerbaijan has increased from 7% in 1925 to 52% in 1932, Uzbekistan from 10% to 52%, and Kazakhstan from 4% to 31.5%.</p>

<p>Requesting Reference to the Precedent of Liu Fu of Peking University</p>
<p>A One-Time Grant of 10,000 Yuan for Relief</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shicen, a famous Chinese philosopher, passed away in his Shanghai residence on the 28th of last month. Scholars across the country were shocked and saddened by the news. Throughout his life, Mr. Li devoted himself to research and did not engage in production. Apart from his academic pursuits, his circumstances were extremely bleak. He was bedridden for more than a month and borrowed money for medical expenses. After his death, there were no funds for funeral expenses. His friends, such as Guo Yilin, managed to raise funds to cover the costs temporarily. Mr. Li left behind children who are still young. The expenses for their future life and education are nowhere to be found, leaving them crying and wailing. Friends and relatives are saddened. Yesterday, the Shanghai alumni association of National Jinan University sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting that the precedent of the late Professor Liu Bannong of Peking University be followed and that preferential treatment be given to Mr. Li's family, with a one-time grant of 10,000 yuan to Mr. Li's family to comfort the deceased and relieve the orphans and widows. The original telegram is recorded below: Urgent, Wang Shijie, Minister of Education of Nanjing, My alma mater Professor Li Shicen, is a leading philosophy expert in China. His more than twenty works are complete and substantial. People in the academic circle have long been aware of this and do not need us to make any further claims. Moreover, Mr. Li devoted his life to academic pursuits. He served in the education sector for more than ten years. This summer, in order to complete his works such as "History of Chinese Philosophy," he overworked himself and died for the sake of learning. The members of this association believe that he has taught at Jinan for more than three years with outstanding results and is truly commendable. In addition to participating in the memorial service to express our condolences, we have learned that Mr. Li was devoted to research and did not engage in production. His circumstances after his death are extremely bleak. Not only does he owe thousands of yuan for medical treatment and funeral expenses, but his wife and four children have no means of support for their future life and education. Therefore, we dare to humbly request your Excellency to follow the method of providing relief to Mr. Liu Bannong and provide relief to Mr. Li's family with 10,000 yuan, so that the living can work hard in academics and the deceased can rest in peace. Your Excellency upholds education and respects academics. Since you have provided relief to Mr. Liu Bannong before, we believe that you will not leave Mr. Li Shicen behind. We eagerly await your instructions. Shanghai Alumni Association of National Jinan University,</p>
<p>Telegram from Jinan Alumni Association in Japan: To the Funeral Committee of Li Residence, Jinan University, and to the family of the deceased, Mr. Shi Cen suddenly passed away. The philosopher has withered away. We have lost our mentor. We are deeply saddened. We send our condolences by telegram. Jinan Alumni Association in Japan</p>

<p>International Banking Market Telegraphs All Rise</p>
<p>Midway Market Too Hard</p>
<p>The exchange market yesterday was closed due to the gold exchange holiday, and the situation suddenly became a bit relaxed and very dazed. In the early morning, the overseas banking market reported that London's major and minor bonds had increased by 25, US silver rose by 375, London's raw gold fell by 1.5 pence, the exchange rate of British pound to US dollar rose by 375, the exchange rate of US dollar to British pound shrank by half, and the exchange rate of British pound to French franc increased by 13 pound notes. The exchange rate of US dollar to French franc decreased by 25. According to reports, the US government will further increase the price of embezzled silver and the budget is insufficient, coupled with the instability of the current Belgian cabinet, the morning exchange market opened with a recent spot price of one shilling four pence thirteen seven five for British exchange and thirty-four yuan six two five for US exchange. Compared with last Saturday, British and American exchanges each lost 0.625. After the opening, although Bombay issued one shilling, the banks traded with each other and the form was settled. The exchange union bank announced its listing, with the British rising 125 and the American rising 1875. Since then, the Chinese merchants continued to have the intention to sell, and the American exchange gradually became loose. The Associated Press reported that the US will continue to increase the amount of silver and the Reuters report that the US government has received a huge amount of gold and not much silver, and said that after China's implementation of the silver export day tax, the outflow of silver has been stopped, or there may be a change of text and direct transactions with China to resist the implementation of silver tax. The rumors that China will abolish the balance tax started again, and the process became extremely loose. Both shillings and US dollars hardened to 625. Later, Sassoon and Guohuo took advantage of the cheap settlement at noon and turned slightly settled. The latent trend was tight. The market continued to be tight, and Bombay and the Joe Straight market were again congested. That is, the silver first reported an increase of one rupee six annas to one rupee seven annas. The process was loose again, and the banks were willing to settle. After loosening and flattening, the Indian silver second reported a small back of seven annas, Citibank settled US dollars, Yuan Maoyong settled shillings, and gradually tended to be tight. Until the close of the market, the recent bid price for British exchange was one shilling four pence four three seven five and the recent bid price for US exchange was thirty-four yuan three one two five. The difference between the forwards was still special. Compared with last Saturday, the British exchange was loose by one two five and the American exchange was hard by two five. The settlement was uneven between South China and China, and it was generally on the selling side.

<p>Since the current silver export craze subsided, although there are inevitable cases of private smuggling by unscrupulous merchants, the number is ultimately small. Therefore, the silver dollar market is gradually stabilizing, and it is no longer as up and down as it was last month. Yesterday, the silver dollar transaction in the market was still the same as 12 cents in the morning and afternoon markets, which was the same as in the previous few days. However, the market became firmer due to the popularity of Yang's use, and it has always stood at 4 cents. However, it is still one cent less than last weekend. In the early market, the transaction of dismantling bills was more than 3.2 million, and the new transaction was more than 800,000. In the afternoon market, the transaction was more than 200,000.

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars (小洋) declined in the early market due to sluggish trading, reaching 829 yuan. Although the afternoon market rebounded by 2 yuan to 831 yuan, the final result was still 3 yuan lower than the previous day. Trading volume was only 4,000 "jiao" (角) in the afternoon market, with no activity reported in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollars (小洋) were at 747.7 yuan in the early market and 748 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in no change from the previous day.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e176">Bond Market Opens Firm, then Rumors Cause Decline in Second Session <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Market Price Already at Peak</p>
<p>Unnecessary Setbacks Easily Occur</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, unusual rumors suddenly surfaced in the market, concerning the Ministry of Finance's sale of 23-year Customs bonds, causing surprise. In reality, buying and selling are common in the market; there's no need to be alarmed. Sales were primarily in 4th issue, 11th issue, and 46th issue bonds. Issues 4 and 11 were consistently sold. On the buying side, retail investors were the majority, with some buying in issues 50 and 56. Although there was activity in issue 96, pushing the price high, the continuous release of 11th issue bonds caused it to fall back down, so the trend remains one of sideways movement, or a slight decline. Yesterday, the market opened strong in the morning, with all bond prices continuing to rise, some by as much as 0.35 yuan, but mostly around 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Rumors immediately arose in the second session, causing market sentiment to weaken, and issues 4 and 46 boldly sold, resulting in declines of 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. The market remained weak at the afternoon opening, falling another 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. At closing, issue 50 saw heavy buying, rebounding by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The outlook is that there are many short positions (椌面空頭), and any opportunity will be used to exert downward pressure. Furthermore, with market prices already high, fluctuations easily occur. If the rumors are untrue, the market should stabilize for a while. Overall, prices fell slightly by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan. The total turnover was 18,475,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e177">Actual Sales Continue, Yarn Market Weakens <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning but declined in the afternoon, with the situation turning slightly weaker due to exchange rate fluctuations. However, current yarn sales remain good. Purchasing from Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, and other provinces continues unabated, causing sentiment to remain firm. Regarding the bullish side, they are exceptionally determined, but some are buying in one issue and selling in another, their actions are bewildering.</p>
<p>Bullish Speculators Liquidate Gold Rooster Yarn</p>
<p>At the opening of the Shanghai Merchants Exchange (標紗) for standard yarn, prices for all months rose by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan due to rising US cotton prices and good sentiment from the previous day. In the afternoon, news of continued exchange rate appreciation emerged, and bullish speculators liquidated positions, causing the market to decline. Geng Fengrun Kang liquidated 3,000 bales, and the market fell by 0.3 to 0.8 yuan. However, current yarn sales were still at 1,700 to 1,800 bales. Total trading volume for the day was 27,900 bales. Sales included: Jifeng 1,000 bales, Geng Feng 3,100 bales, Yuan Yi 900 bales, Chang Feng 750 bales, and Xin Cheng 1,350 bales. Purchases included: Tong Ji 750 bales, Da Fu 1,850 bales, Da Feng 1,250 bales, Sen Geng 1,250 bales, Chang Feng 1,400 bales, Yong Chang 900 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Ming De 450 bales, Dian Chang 1,250 bales, Tai Chang 800 bales, and Yi Chang 650 bales.

<h3 id="e178">Shaanxi Cotton Arrives, Futures Cotton Suddenly Falls <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially stabilized, then fell. While US cotton prices continued to rise and exchange rates appreciated, sentiment weakened slightly. Another explanation is that two shipments of Henan and Shaanxi cotton (豫陜棉) have arrived in Shanghai, totaling approximately 7,000 bales, with another 3,000 to 4,000 on the way. As a result, sentiment has weakened, and the market has fallen by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Turns Lower in Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the Shanghai Cotton Exchange (標花) for standard cotton, buying was good due to continued gains in US and Indian cotton markets. However, towards the third session (拍至三收盤), bullish speculators liquidated positions, causing the market to loosen. As a result, nearby months rose by 0.05 yuan, while middle months remained unchanged. The afternoon opening was still good, but prices suddenly fell in the second and third sessions (拍至二三盤) due to the arrival of 7,000 to 8,000 bales of Henan and Shaanxi cotton. However, most of this cotton is held by financial institutions, so sentiment only weakened slightly. Prices for all months fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 64,900 "dan" (擔). Sales included: Sui Long 1,000 dan, Geng Feng 1,400 dan, Da Da 4,700 dan, Heng De 1,000 dan, Ju Chang 1,500 dan, Shen Ji 2,100 dan, Xin Cheng 1,000 dan, Yi Kang 1,400 dan, and Chang He 6,000 dan. Purchases included: Da Fu 2,200 dan, Shen Chang 1,200 dan, Yi Chang 3,000 dan, Chang Feng 1,200 dan, Da Feng 3,700 dan, Yuan Da 1,100 dan, Geng Feng 3,100 dan, and Run Kang 2,800 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices for standard cotton (標花) are listed below, along with price changes and inventory counts.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Discussed</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales remain stable. Mill currency (廠幣) is weak. Sources estimate Yao cotton at 610 bales. Dongtai cotton, Shenxin Mill purchased 100 bales. Spot goods were delivered to the mill. Tianjin American species at 515.25, Shenxin Mill purchased 100 pieces. Spot goods were delivered to the mill.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Grain: Rumors of New Australian Wheat Contracts Lead to Sudden Decline in Wheat and Flour Markets <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Flour Market: After the morning opening, the market for all months presented a consistent and stable appearance, with foreign wheat quoted at Chicago at -0.04 to -0.10 yuan and Canadian at -0.08 to -0.10 yuan. At the time of opening, sentiment among both industry insiders and outsiders was quite good, and mills were reluctant to sell, so the market for all months gradually improved, rising by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the previous week. However, at the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere suddenly changed drastically due to rumors that mills had contracted for another ship of Australian foreign wheat, or perhaps two ships, with prices rumored at 4.80 yuan or 4.90 yuan. This caused sentiment to weaken significantly, and mills immediately started selling, with outsiders following suit. Prices for all months suddenly fell by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the morning market. However, the current month slightly improved due to some replenishment by mills, while distant months remained stable and weak. As a result, the current month fell by 0.04 yuan, February fell by 0.035 yuan, and March and April fell by 0.025 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat Market: After the morning opening, the market initially showed stability, then signs of declining. Foreign wheat was quoted at both Chicago and Canada at -0.04 to -0.08 yuan to -0.10 yuan. At the time of opening, trading for all months remained quiet. The market was slightly better by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan as sellers held back. However, at the afternoon opening, the market was initially stable, but later fell sharply due to the sudden decline in the flour market and rumors of continued contracts for two ships of foreign wheat. The market atmosphere weakened significantly, and prices fell across the board. The near-term prices saw greater declines due to mill activity. Future trends will depend on the price of foreign wheat and exchange rates. As a result, the current month fell by 0.06 yuan, December fell by 0.06 yuan, January fell by 0.05 yuan, February fell by 0.03 yuan, and March fell by 0.01 yuan. The spot wheat market remains stable, with 10,000 bags of Shandong Xuzhou Guide wheat opening at 3.90 yuan. They were borrowed by Lingfu Fengfuxin Da office.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat prices are strongly influenced by robust international market conditions. Continued drought in the Southwest region has further boosted prices recently. However, improved conditions in Argentina are slightly unfavorable to the market. Increased participation in trading from outside parties.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Red Grain Greatly Devastated by Japanese Army After Fall of Northeast <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>—Prices Remain Firm, Soybean Prices Rise Again—</p>
<p>This year, the production area for red grain (紅糧) has been greatly reduced because the Japanese army forced villagers to live forty "li" (里) outside the railway line before they could plant, so production is only about 50% to 60%. Therefore, the production price is rising daily, and transportation is not profitable. Spot supply for inspection is tight, and the market cannot meet demand, so prices are soaring. Yesterday, the market spot supply was only two cars of red grain. They were transported by Pinggu and Hexing separately and were used to cover previous short positions. Seeing the market strength, merchants immediately resold one car at 3.55 yuan. Another car of spot goods for delivery in two or three days was sold at 3.46 yuan. Three cars for delivery in two weeks were initially quoted at 3.42 yuan, but the price continuously rose via telegraph in the afternoon, further tightening the market and reaching 3.48 yuan. Therefore, the grain market is quite strong. Soybean prices also rose due to increased production costs and tight spot supplies. Sentiment is optimistic. Yesterday's market saw a rise of 0.04 to 0.05 yuan compared to last week. Total trading volume was 12 or 13 cars of various soybeans, destined for Changzhou, local streets, inland regions, and export factories.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Rainy Weather Causes Slight Rise in Rice Market <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Only about twenty sources from various provinces, totaling over three thousand "shi" (石). The continuous rain slightly strengthened market sentiment. Although sales on this street are not brisk, customers are cautiously placing orders. Only the Qingdao province office purchased one load of several hundred bags. As a result, the market managed to show some improvement, with prices rising by a few "fen" (分) or "jiao" (角). Late-season rice from Qingjiao, Songsi, Fengjing, Xilian, and other areas saw prices increase by several "fen". Thick "geng" (粳) rice from the Suzhou, Sutong, and Nangang provinces rose by about a "jiao". "Yebai" (野白) rice saw a rise of more than a "jiao". Only Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan varieties, which are already rare, saw no price change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 to 19 sources from He Xia arrived in Shanghai. Due to the rainy weather, there was some trading in new "geng" (粳) rice, broken "geng" (粳) rice, new "yang" (羊) Du Jian, thin rice, and aged Bai Yuan in the early market. The afternoon market was quiet. New and aged "bu" (埠) Ke Jian early rice was slightly better. The market price for new "geng" (粳) rice was better by about 0.1 yuan in the early market, but turned flat in the afternoon. There was no significant change in the prices of broken "geng" (粳) rice, new Du Jian thin rice, early rice, new and aged "bu" (埠) rice, and new and aged "bu" (埠) Ke Jian. Aged Bai Yuan and new "yang" (羊) Jian rice saw prices increase by more than a "jiao".</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign Xiang rice experienced some changes. In the morning, demand was weak, so the market rose but stalled. Subsequently, with inland activity and some local buying, trading picked up, and the price of foreign Xiang rice and foreign rice rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The afternoon started active, but then foreign merchants lowered prices to sell distant-term contracts due to the exchange rate decrease of foreign currency. The distant-term market immediately fell by a few "fen" (分), and foreign merchants still had a lot of supply to sell. The outlook remains somewhat bearish. Spot and near-term prices are mostly holding firm due to Japanese buyers' desire for spot purchases, and the market price is not affected by the distant-term market. Ke Xian was slightly active at the beginning, but demand was even stronger. The total daily trading volume was 2,500 bags of Hunan rice, 2,550 bags of Sha City Hankou machine-milled rough rice, 2,350 bags of spot Guizhou rice, 700 bags of Annam "geng" (粳) rice, 1,500 bags of Siamese rice, and 1,300 tons of time rice road goods. These were distributed by both local and inland merchants.</p>

<p>The trading of white tung oil in Hankou's foreign market has not been very active, with only a few scattered dozens of tons at 29.6 yuan. However, various foreign firms have secured futures contracts in various production areas. It is rumored that they have purchased January and February futures contracts in Wanxian, Sichuan, with a delivered price in Hankou of around 26 yuan. They have also purchased January and February contracts in Changde, Hunan, with a delivered price in Hankou above 27 yuan. Delivery is in Hankou. Foreign firms are willing to offer 27.6 yuan, but Hankou oil merchants are still hesitant to sell in advance because there are reports of selling pressure in the production areas. Although the quantity is unclear, it is likely not small. Therefore, Hankou firms are afraid of having trouble delivering when the time comes. To avoid being squeezed (免受軋), they are being very cautious about selling forward. However, various foreign firms have not yet filled their futures quotas, so foreign market trading is likely to be on the rise. New goods in various production areas of Zhejiang are gradually coming onto the market. It is currently heard that a fully packaged West box (西箱) is selling for 14 yuan in Lanxi, and Qing oil West box is 14.4 yuan, both in Jiangxia, showing that prices are falling daily. Hangzhou merchants have not yet come to Shanghai to sell recently. The estimated price for sending goods to Shanghai is around 25 yuan per "zhu" (砠). With new goods becoming available, the market is trending downward, and trading is also becoming scattered.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw sluggish sales. Although the trend was up, the public association set the price for grade 24 coarse sand white sugar at 18.55 yuan for ordinary spot goods, down 0.05 yuan from the previous day. There was limited trading. Goods from this warehouse were at 18.65 yuan, and re-export goods were at 5.3 yuan, also down 0.05 yuan. Grade 8-9 Dutch red sugar was quoted at 14.05 yuan for spot goods, with some being sold. Re-export goods were offered at 5 yuan but no deal was made, with a willingness to lower the price. The factory's fine white sugar was stable. Changyu No. 1 remained above 6.8 yuan. Only a few hundred packages of old domestic sugar were offered at 12.6 to 12.5 yuan. Jianbang offered 120 boxes of newly arrived standard Five Blessings White Ice sugar, at 17.8 yuan per "zhu" (砠), with more goods on the way. According to the firm's tone, there is an intention to increase prices in the future. Based on market conditions, a rise is indeed possible. According to news from Lanxi, production of new green sugar this year is expected to increase, estimated at around 300,000 "dan" (擔). It will be on the market in a week. The initial top end is expected to hit 10 yuan, with subsequent declines.</p>

<p>Tong'an dried longan (桂圓肉) recently passed 43 yuan, up 4 yuan. However, other goods were unwilling to follow, so a deal could not be reached. Yesterday, the firms changed their approach and negotiated again, and opinions gradually converged. The deal was reached at 44 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan in total. However, there may not be many goods left, so further increases are expected.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market at the foreign firms in Shanghai remained quiet. The sales of local green tea such as Pingshui Tu Zhuang, and black tea such as Qimen Yuhu almost completely stopped. Lux Zhuang Zhenmei green tea, and Tianyu Baochang and other firms, slightly took in some inventory, but the market price has fallen by one or two yuan compared to before. However, for the item Needle Eyebrow, English firms such as Xie He and Yi He have a high demand, and other firms have also sent telegrams. Direct labor (逕勞) seems to be slightly more active than before.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Piece Goods and Small Cap Flannel Business Declines <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Hat flannel, which is normally at the peak of its sales season at this time of year, is now seeing sluggish business with limited shipments. This is because the number of people wearing small caps is decreasing daily, and small cap factories are lacking in inventory, showing signs of decline and elimination. The arrival of new small cap flannel is also rare. The flannel industry, seeing the sluggish sales last year, has collectively stopped placing orders. However, dark blue broadcloth business is still good.</p>

<h3 id="e189">On Writers <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>Discussions on writers are not new, but they are particularly prevalent this year. The magazine "Literature" (文學) alone has discussed five or six writers. The fact that the writers being discussed are our contemporaries adds to our interest. However, if we pay close attention, we can immediately find important significance in this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In past discussions of writers, we have rarely found anything satisfactory. Some are out of context, forcing interpretations; others abandon science and nitpick over words. In reality, writing about writers is not an easy task. The author must have broad knowledge: generally in social science, specifically in art and literature. Most importantly, they must deeply understand the creative process of the writer being discussed.</p>
<p>We can say that discussions of writers are a special form of literary criticism. It is a type of criticism that expresses literary history in a comprehensive form. On one hand, it analyzes the writer's thoughts in their works, elucidating their historical realization and their attitude towards "life." These thoughts and attitudes are hidden beneath the cloak of imagery. To reveal them, we must use both methods: a "microscope" and a "telescope." Closely linked to analysis is evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluation is what humans are said to be born with. But scientifically speaking, this is because humans are purposeful social practitioners. Unlike bees and ants, human actions pass through consciousness and are guided by it. Humans set correct goals based on realistic possibilities and act towards those goals. This setting depends on evaluation. Of course, analysis includes evaluation, and evaluation includes analysis.</p>
<p>Applying this principle to discussions of writers means that they not only explain what the writer is like but also judge what the writer will become or should become.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the author's position and method are paramount. A discussion of a writer not only examines past creations but also guides ongoing and future creations. If the author's position is contrary to the objective development of history and the method is contrary to the correct principles of science, then the above tasks cannot be fully accomplished.</p>
<p>The occurrence of all social phenomena, although caused by historical development, must be based on social necessity. The current prevalence of discussions of writers should be viewed in this light. What makes us feel gratified is that most current discussions of writers follow the above path. This phenomenon is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Our literature has swept away the clusters of mandarin duck and butterfly fiction (鴛鴦蝴蝶), eliminated the ranks of talented scholars and beautiful women, and is moving forward step by step along the winding path of historical necessity. It is now reaching a new stage. It is exploring reality, expressing reality, and clarifying the major cells that have already developed on its body. Through this reckoning, it can learn some "ways to nourish life" to achieve beauty.</p>
<p>The current prevalence of discussions of writers, and the fact that they are prevalent on the path of science, tells us the above important meaning in itself. We offer our constant efforts to it as a gift to its "new life."</p>
<h3 id="e190">Thinking About Other Things From Inventions <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers carried two astonishing news items: one was a new invention in aviation, and the other was the successful testing of a death ray.</p>
<p>These inventions and successes are actually not new. They were revealed in various newspapers a long time ago, so why should they be treated as astonishing news now? However, precisely because it seems like World War II is about to arrive, and these inventions and successes can be used directly or indirectly as weapons of killing, they are particularly startling. Journalists should be the most perceptive people in the world. Can we ask them not to carry this as astonishing news in the newspapers?</p>
<p>According to the newspapers, the new invention in aviation is simply a major revolution in aviation history. It has already been adopted by the French Air Force and can make the French Air Force dominate the skies. The success of the death ray test was also led by the French Army, but the inventors are the German Kailaus and the Frenchman Christmas. Unlike the new invention in aviation, which is entirely the work of French scientists, it is still unknown which country the inventors will dedicate this new weapon of killing to. Perhaps they will use it as a tool for world peace.</p>
<p>France has always been a country with a dominant air force. Now that it has this newly invented aviation technology, it can naturally make its air force dominate the skies. However, the unfortunate thing is that the death ray is not necessarily owned by France. It is said that the death ray can completely disable humans who encounter it. If a giant machine emits a light of five million candlepower, it can completely disable enemy aircraft because the pilot will immediately become stiff and die upon encountering the light, and the aircraft will naturally fall. Although the new aviation technology invented by French scientists can make aircraft fly very stably in the air, rise and fall without danger, and is entirely based on automatic mechanisms, it still requires a person to sit on it and press the buttons. Upon encountering the death ray, it will completely lose its effectiveness. If France does not secure this death ray, it will be difficult to dominate the skies with its air force.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still many scientists desperately inventing new weapons of killing. Now is the time when World War II is about to arrive. All imperialists are expanding their military equipment as much as possible, and scientists have always served the imperialist warlords. It is only natural for them to invent new weapons of killing for the imperialist warlords. The main thing is how to transfer these new weapons of killing to the hands of those who oppose imperialism and use them as weapons to eliminate the war. This is the most urgent step at present. Naturally, we must fundamentally demand that other scientists who oppose imperialism invent new weapons to eliminate the war. That is to say, inventing what weapons is not the problem. The problem is for whom to invent them and what to use them for. From this, we can see the proper path a scientist should take at present. Therefore, even the inventors of the death ray should not immediately be given a bad name.</p>
<p>According to the tone of the journalists, this death ray, which has not yet been contributed to any country, may be used as a tool for world peace. Although this is an unfulfilled prayer, we cannot help but hope that every scientist will walk this path. We especially hope that every scientist will first recognize which countries are truly seeking world peace, and then contribute everything to it.</p>
<p>However, recently French scientists have also tested piloting unmanned aircraft with radio waves. It is said that with this new invention, aviators can sit safely in the office, holding the radio switch in one hand, and arbitrarily direct the movement of distant aircraft, and this will soon be realized. In this way, naturally the death ray will have no way to deal with the aircraft. Because the power of the death ray can only completely disable or immediately stiffen and kill humans who encounter it, but it cannot destroy the unmanned aircraft itself. As a result, radio-controlled aircraft will still dominate the skies.</p>
<p>I think, then many scientists will invent a tool to cut off the radio waves and completely negate the effectiveness of the radio-controlled aircraft. This reminds me of the formula in our general novels of gods, monsters, swordsmen, and heroes: if you have a magic weapon to subdue me, I will have a magic weapon to subdue your magic weapon; if I have a weapon to defeat you, you will have a weapon to defeat my weapon. The Monkey King was able to make a big disturbance in the Heavenly Palace because he had the ability to transform into seventy-two different forms; if it were not for the Buddha's palm being able to restrain his somersaults, I am afraid that the whole world would have been turned upside down by him in one morning. However, fortunately, it is the process of this formula; otherwise, it would be a small matter for the Monkey King to turn the world upside down long ago. At most, it would only shorten the enthusiasm of those who read Journey to the West. The most unfortunate thing is that humans would only have to be slaves to the privileged few who possess a weapon of killing forever.</p>
<p>However, the process of this formula has now reached the time when it should end. The author of Journey to the West only wasted a little ink to put together this formula and make people spend many useful hours. We also feel that it is too uneconomical; and now there are still many scientists who do not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of all mankind to put together this formula. Are we still going to let it go on? The prehistory of mankind should end, and all human abilities should serve the happiness of mankind itself. At the beginning of the real history of mankind, mankind first ended all disputes between humans and applied all its abilities to disputes with and overcoming nature. At this time, all scientists will no longer compete with each other to invent new weapons of killing to subdue or defeat others. Naturally, this formula will be cancelled invisibly. Why don't we make all scientists quickly end the invention of new weapons of killing?</p>

<p>— Ding Yishan</p>
<p>I advocate that a lie that does no harm to any party, but benefits one or both, should be told when it is necessary to lie.</p>
<p>I have examples among my friends: a woman in labor lost her beloved husband. She asked others about her husband's condition, and they said he was well, even though he had already entered the earth. Telling her the truth would likely result in two deaths. Telling her later, when it was safe for her to hear it, would not be too late. Another is a close friendship where a female classmate is passionately in love. Lying in such situations is excusable.</p>
<p>Today, I was taking a photo outdoors with a friend, having just adjusted the aperture. A completely unrelated person asked us to take a picture for him. Honestly refusing would have embarrassed him too much. Being poisoned by the need to save face, we had no choice but to consider his feelings. He knew nothing about photography. Fortunately, we had already taken eight shots and wound the film past. My friend pretended to take a picture for him. He asked if it was taken well, and my friend said it was. He wanted my friend to give him a copy, but my friend said it might not develop well, that the picture might be bad, but if it was good, he would print one for him. Thus, this unrelated person was happy without expecting a photo. We remained unrelated people.</p>
<p>On the way back, my friend felt sorry for him. I thought he was not to be pitied. The pitiable ones are those who know there will be no result but still seek help from others.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Night at Han Shengjia's Pottery Village (Part 1) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>Beneath the veil of night, it was pitch black...</p>
<p>Apart from the rumbling of the carriage wheels, everything was as silent as if dead. The night was already old. People were silent in the carriage, enduring a stifling hunger, staring straight ahead, waiting for the destination they longed for to appear. But before their eyes was only a vast, dark expanse...</p>
<p>The driver cracked his whip in the air, [Crack!] sending out a clear, sharp sound. He pointed the whip towards the distant side and said, [That's Han Shengjia's Pottery Village.]</p>
<p>It seemed there was still a yellow flicker of light in the direction the whip indicated, and the carriage was shaking violently. Rubbing tired eyes, the light could no longer be found.</p>
<p>[Am I seeing things?] I thought.</p>
<p>[Crack!] The carriage sped up a little. Leaning out, I carefully peered at the place the driver had just indicated. The wind carried the wild howls of dogs; sure enough, a cluster of darker outlines squatted not far away.</p>
<p>[It's really not a big village...] I thought with a slight disappointment.</p>
<p>Then, two flickers of light could be seen. People perked up, stretching their lazy waists and rubbing their bellies, entrusting their fatigue and hunger to the place with the flickering three or four lights.</p>
<p>It was a small village of twenty or thirty households. With a rumble, the carriage stopped in front of a door with a visible firelight. Knocking on the door, they peered inside through a wide crack. Suddenly, the inside of the house turned pitch black very quickly.</p>
<p>[Hey, we're asking for lodging, what are you afraid of!] The driver wiped his face and shouted inside. But after a moment, the inside remained silent...</p>
<p>[—Hey...] Impatient, he banged on the door forcefully.</p>
<p>[We really don't have anything!]</p>
<p>[We're asking for lodging—only grandsons would lie to you!]</p>
<p>[Ah, how many of you are there, where are you from?]</p>
<p>[Baotou. Important guests from Baotou—open up!]</p>
<p>[Warm, open up] Another old voice.</p>
<p>The door opened, and an old man struck a match, shaking it to light an oil lamp. Under the dim, struggling lamplight, he anxiously sized up the guests outside:</p>
<p>[Bosses, find another place!]</p>
<p>[They're students, not bosses, don't worry, we'll pay tomorrow, it'll be alright, these gentlemen are all students.]</p>
<p>One by one, they moved their luggage inside. Each patted the dust off themselves and continuously ran into this small mud house. These types of houses were commonly seen in recent journeys: every part of the house was covered with yellow mud, and at its lowest point, only one person could stand nearly upright. People who stretched could touch the roof. Including the original three people, there were thirteen heads coming and going inside the small house. It seemed exceptionally crowded.</p>
<p>[Is there anything to eat? We haven't eaten anything for most of the day.]</p>
<p>One of the householders, a thin woman with a pale face, looked at the two guards who came with them as if frightened: [We haven't eaten anything all day either, bosses!]</p>
<p>Amidst many disappointed and surprised eyes were some looks of disbelief. They stared blankly at her face; their faces; then, without any ideas, looked around the house; empty pots, cold stove, a half-covered water tank with six bowls and several pairs of chopsticks on it, besides these, nothing else could be found.</p>
<p>Silently, they scratched their heads, and the group sat and lay down on a kang on the east side. The guard, sent especially for them, who had a collapsed nose, patted the box on his side and sat down beside them.</p>
<p>[Don't lie, who would eat your food for free, we'll definitely pay tomorrow—right?]</p>
<p>[We're not lying, bosses, we really don't have anything at all.]</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Wandering Swordsman (5) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>He had a very good fishing rod, but he didn't catch many fish, maybe one or two. He rarely came back empty-handed.</p>
<p>On the rare clear morning, passing by the thatched hut extending at the foot of the city wall, one could always see [Xiang Fu] sitting on the riverbank, leaning against a willow tree, holding the fishing rod, gazing into the distance across the reeds. His head, deeply covered by a tattered hat, swayed constantly, and a smile floated on his mushroom-like face, as if bowing to the herons standing in the water.</p>
<p>The river could be considered a small stream, barely able to accommodate a flat-bottomed boat. It snaked out from the ironworks, forming a pond here. Reeds grew luxuriantly, and lotus flowers and reed catkins scattered with a faint fragrance, obscuring the pedestrians and the acrid floating dust on the right. Passersby on the bridge would often stop, mocking the strange old man, [Xiang Fu]. But he never paid attention to them. Something made him young, luring him thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Only when he noticed that a fish had taken the [float], and raised the rod, but the hook was empty, would he start grumbling angrily while putting an earthworm on the hook:</p>
<p>[...Unreasonable...Despicable...]</p>
<p>No one would believe he was fishing.</p>
<p>After re-immersing the hook in the water, he looked into the distance again. His forehead smoothed out because of happiness. Maybe because he saw red clouds, he suddenly shouted loudly, as he hated rain the most. Just thinking about rain would make his spine tingle. How would he spend such a gloomy day! He wouldn't even dream of it. He would pour white liquor straight into his belly.</p>
<p>He watched a school of small fish gathering on the bank, chirping and chasing a yellow leaf, and he laughed. He said loudly:</p>
<p>[It's you, huh? This dragon is still hard to subdue, like a dragon!]</p>

<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>To glue the linings for my wife's cotton shoes, I didn't cover the paste pot, which attracted two flies. Silently, they were just licking at the mouth of the pot. Waving them away didn't work; they seemed greedy and insatiable. I used the tip of my fountain pen to stab at them, piercing their abdomens and killing them. They lay dead on the table, and I felt proudly self-satisfied. Unexpectedly, my wife strongly objected, saying that the flies at the end of autumn and the beginning of winter were already half-dead and their senses were so dull that they had lost the ability to spread germs and would no longer harm people. Killing a [dead tiger] doesn't make you a towering hero, does it? You are supposed to be a scholarly and reasonable man.</p>
<p>I was subjected to this barrage of sarcasm from my wife. I knew her words were correct, but I was still not willing to concede. How could a dignified man be [put down] by a woman? Of course, I had my reasons:</p>
<p>[Regardless of whether it is harmful now, in the past, its [crimes are obvious]. How many deaths are on their bodies? Don't you remember that the Chongming man who pushed a cart next door to your house died of acute koleragical spasm, along with his entire family of seven, after eating a dead fly—also, didn't I have diarrhea for three days and three nights because I touched food after swatting flies? Often, epidemics throughout a village or city are initiated by flies, which are no less harmful than floods, ferocious beasts, drugs, or red bandits. We can't let them go just because they are old and weak, pardoning their past crimes of killing. You women are always soft-hearted. You must know that if they survive these seasons, they will become killing demons again.]</p>
<p>My wife was afraid of stirring up my anger, so she didn't argue further. However, I was still indignant.</p>
<p>How fierce, how arrogant, how cunning the flies of summer are. On a grand scale, they cause death to fill the fields, threatening homes. For example, if you lose sleep at night because of bedbugs and want to make up for it during the day, a fly will land on your nose and buzz incessantly. Just as you are about to raise your hand to strike it, it already gets the news and enters your ears and eyelids, eventually preventing you from being able to [sleep soundly by the north window]. Their behavior goes beyond [destroying nine generations of your family].</p>
<p>However, summer passes, autumn comes, and winter arrives again. Those who were once rampant bow their heads, become docile and dull, to the point of being like this. As the saying goes, [When fortune comes, the wind carries the Prince Teng Pavilion; when fortune departs, thunder shatters the Temple of Felicity Stele]. Observing flies, one can understand this.</p>

<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>The Drummer</p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in Beiping for a while, except for a few well-off people, is probably familiar with the [drummer].</p>
<p>The [drummer], I think, is indeed a close friend of impoverished gentry and poor young men. At dawn, he carries two large baskets and holds a small, one-inch drum in one hand and a drumstick about half a foot long in the other. He slowly walks through one alley after another, knocking, "de, de, de..." If someone wants to sell antiques or jewelry, he buys them; if someone wants to sell household goods, he buys them; if someone wants to sell scrap copper or iron, he buys them; if someone wants to sell torn clothes or old shoes, he buys them... The things he wants to buy are very diverse. Whether they are for fun, for use, or discarded as waste, he does not refuse. A group of impoverished gentry families has received a lot of help from him.</p>
<p>If you have traded with him once or twice and he has sensed your weakness, knowing that you are someone who has a hard time making ends meet, as soon as you hear the "de, de, de..." sound, you don't even need to open your mouth. He will come into your residence and ask gently: "Do you have anything to sell?" If you are not so poor as to lack the necessities for eating and using, you will naturally feel annoyed and disgusted by his persistent inquiries, and you will inevitably scold him a few times and send him away. But if you don't even have money to buy cakes, when you see him coming, you rummage under the bed and search in the chests, looking carefully in the corners and on the bookshelves... If you find some broken shoes, old clothes, old newspapers, or glass bottles that you never paid much attention to, you will feel as happy as if you had found some treasure. When you take out the goods, even if they are not worth much, he will not leave immediately because he doesn't like them. He will always gently raise the price step by step until both parties are satisfied, which is much better than pawnshop clerks who often discourage you with a few unpleasant words. Wouldn't such a person seem amiable to poor young men?</p>
<p>The [drummer]'s business is very prosperous. Every day, just sitting in the residence, you will hear the "de de de..." sound at least ten or eight times. The reason for its prosperity, I think, may be precisely because it shows the decadence and decline of the old capital. Sometimes, I even suspect that this sound may be the death knell of this ancient city!</p>

<h3 id="e197">Much Ado About Chinese Courtesy on the Tram <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I took the Shanghai-Hangzhou slow train from Songjiang at 3:05 PM to Shanghai. I got off at the South Station and immediately boarded the No. 4 tram from Gaochang Temple to Nanyang Bridge. At that time, the third-class car was already crowded. Although the first-class car was also full, it was not too crowded. I saw a person occupying almost two seats, with plenty of space on both sides, so I squeezed in to sit on one side because I had been walking with some difficulty. I didn't greet the person next to me because there was already space and there was no need to greet them.</p>
<p>Someone next to me, A (with four or five companions), got angry. He sneered and said: [It's ridiculous, do you have to sit here?]</p>
<p>I stood up and replied: [If you were sitting here, I might as well sit there.]</p>
<p>Someone else, B, chimed in, saying that I didn't [greet them] when I sat down, as if commanding people to move, which was absurd.</p>
<p>I said, I don't know your name, so I don't know how to [greet] you. I only know that you sit where there is space on the tram and I don't understand the rules of [greeting].</p>
<p>Another person, C, also made a sarcastic remark, saying, [Do you expect us to get up and give you our seats when we see you coming? How unreasonable! The Chinese don't understand courtesy.]</p>
<p>I said, I didn't know about [Chinese courtesy]. Now I know that when you sit on the tram, you must [greet] and [apologize] to the person next to you before you can sit down. Is this [Chinese courtesy]?</p>
<p>Another person, D, explained from the side (this one was the oldest of the four, about forty years old, and spoke with a little less anger): [For example, on the train, if there is no space, you must [greet] the person sitting first and ask them to make some room. It's the same on the tram.]</p>
<p>I wanted to argue with them further, but I thought I had eaten my fill and had nothing better to do than to bicker with these people. My energy would be wasted. But these gentlemen seemed to know something about [Chinese courtesy] and didn't seem completely uncivilized, so I thought about this so-called [Chinese courtesy].</p>
<p>He occupies more than two seats on the tram by himself. When he sees many people, he refuses to make room unless someone [greets] and [apologizes] to him. If you don't greet him, he will push you. Is this [Chinese courtesy]?</p>
<p>On the train, I often see one person occupying two or three seats and lying down to sleep, regardless of whether there is enough room for the other passengers to stand. He doesn't care and sleeps soundly until someone [greets] and [apologizes] to him and asks him to get up, then he slowly sits up. Is this [Chinese courtesy]?</p>
<p>Later, I thought that these people were still good. If they had been impolite and punched me, wouldn't I have suffered? I am thankful that these gentlemen still understood [Chinese courtesy], so I didn't suffer a big loss. Congratulations, congratulations.</p>

<p>It's too hard to eat this year. However, being a person is even harder, especially for us young men.</p>
<p>The crime of [youthful exuberance] seems to be tied to your head from birth, not allowing you to move at all: If you raise a hand, that hand is not raised properly. If you lift a leg, that leg is not in accordance with the rules. It would be best to send you to a desolate island or an ancient temple to be a monk for three years!</p>

<p>Natural disasters and man-made disasters, national affairs are deteriorating day by day, and who among the people does not want to catch up and save China, but there are many ways to save the country: dancing, chanting scriptures, the so-called ten years to grow a tree, ten years to teach, no matter what, everything must be done slowly. But he used a bomb to kill a traitorous merchant, thinking that the country would be saved in this way. Is it that easy?</p>
<p>Not that it is time to make judgments, no matter how people shake their heads, he is always a patriotic person, and it is still worth it to be so hot-tempered. If even this little bit of anger disappears completely, it really makes people afraid to think about it!</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Intellectual <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Jieren</p>
<p>To put it more elegantly, intellectuals are [scholars]. If you think that's too old-fashioned, then call them the [knowledge class]! But aren't we advocating [popular language] this year? Compared to those, [intellectuals] is the more common term!</p>
<p>Since ancient times, intellectuals have been the most respected: among the four classes of people [scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants], intellectuals sat in the first chair. Because intellectuals are saints (?), and intellectuals will be officials in the future, they should be respected by everyone. So, [Even if the descendants are foolish, books must be read], if the ancestors in heaven have a spirit, once they pass the imperial examination, they can glorify their ancestors, gain the praise of the villagers, and be respected by everyone. If so, isn't this life fulfilling and the way to be human exhausted? Otherwise, at least he is an intellectual, a [literary family], which is not enough to be proud of.</p>
<p>Now it's different. Intellectuals have fallen from their thrones.</p>
<p>What good are intellectuals?</p>
<p>That's what people say. Indeed, intellectuals are of no use: [They can neither tell fortunes nor carry burdens]. At most, they can sell manuscripts and be literary beggars. But intellectuals still put on their arrogant airs, thinking that they are people who have read books, and that these wild things are not worth mentioning! [A scholar can be killed, but he cannot be humiliated], and [Starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a great matter]. If you take off this ragged gown, won't you lose face and status? That's something you'd rather die than do!</p>
<p>But now it's really different from before! Everyone says: [Farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers]. At least they show some face, only demoting them by three levels, without kicking them to the bottom. At the time, a confused] person said to his brother in a letter: [Scholars are at the bottom of the four classes, and it is impossible to be at the bottom of the four classes!] Although these words boosted the morale of others and diminished one's own prestige, they were nonetheless prescient. However, most intellectuals are mistaken by books. They only know how to hold books, shake their heads, and hum in a high or low voice: [In books there are houses of gold, in books there are jade-like beauties]. In this way, intellectuals can only isolate themselves from the world and live in the world of their own minds!</p>
<h3 id="e200">Shanghai's Private Elementary Schools <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Younong</p>
<p>Indeed, the importance of elementary school education cannot be denied. Our China knows its power, and all European and American countries attach importance to it. As a result, schools have sprung up, slowly from national, provincial, and county schools, and private individuals have also set up schools. Apart from opening up a way to make money, it can also be seen that Chinese people are enthusiastic about education.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, due to the large population and the relationship with the concessions, private schools are particularly prosperous, especially elementary schools. I myself have mixed in private schools for a few years. Although I am not a complete expert, I dare say that I know more than an outsider. Now I will write what I know to serve the readers.</p>
<p>The decoration of a store is very important for its business. Setting up an elementary school in Shanghai is of course the same. Although private elementary schools do not have sufficient funds like official elementary schools, they have to save in various places and decorate the school buildings a little more beautifully. This will not only overwhelm [competitors], but also attract customers.</p>
<p>Regarding teaching methods and [child psychology], they are rarely studied, because there are many [competitors]—although not as door-to-door and household-to-household as cigarette paper exchange and pawnshops, the number of so-called [lane elementary schools] in Shanghai is also considerable!—In this serious situation, they have to change their tastes and shift the research on [child psychology] and teaching methods to research on [parent psychology]. For example, which types of people live in this area, and they have to suit the tastes of these types of people, and change the subjects [according to local conditions]. For example, several elementary schools in a certain district do not have labor, art, singing, or physical education, but supplement them with English and classical Chinese.</p>
<p>The treatment of teachers is an exception everywhere, so this cannot be put in the example. In various aspects, such as taking care of capital, decorating the facade, etc., they have to calculate on the teachers' salaries and ask them (or her) to work hard, even to serve on a half-empty stomach. Otherwise, if you don't do it, then please leave. Anyway, you are not the only one who is unemployed. If you have money, are you still afraid that you can't buy goods?</p>
<p>It is also unsightly not to have female teachers. This is because women are gentle and very suitable for teaching children. At the same time, face is also very important. How can a school not have female teachers? Therefore, the conditions for hiring female teachers are even more stringent than those for men. However, readers should not misunderstand that female teachers are also vases.</p>
<p>What is it like in terms of training and teaching? The low salaries of teachers make their (or her) lives insecure, and the number of class hours per week is always more than thousands of minutes. They (or she) also have to correct papers after class. Their spirit is limited, and of course they cannot have good teaching methods to use in the classroom.</p>
<p>The place and equipment for physical education are even more out of the question. In addition to the classroom, the student recreation area is the alley. Shanghai's land is like gold. Where can they rent a sports field and purchase sports equipment for money?</p>

<p>— Wan Guoan</p>
<p>(3) What Division Was Forgotten</p>
<p>The big, dark fellow arrived at a dilapidated ancestral hall and, led by two guys with Mauser pistols, entered the tiled house in the front. Inside the house sat two thin military officers, who immediately scowled as soon as he entered and asked:</p>
<p>[Which division of the Japanese army are you from?]</p>
<p>[I forgot.]</p>
<p>[Bullshit—you forgot your division headquarters?]</p>
<p>[I've been a soldier for seven or eight years, and I've never figured out which division I'm in. I remember which company, which battalion, which regiment, and which squad I'm in.]</p>
<p>[Do you think the White Army is good?]</p>
<p>[I'm not a soldier of the White or Red Army; I'm a soldier of the National Revolutionary Army.]</p>
<p>[This guy is really stupid; he doesn't even understand this. Shoot him!]</p>
<p>[I don't care if you shoot me, but I don't have a wife yet!]</p>
<p>[If you tell the truth, I'll give you a wife.] The questioner said with a smile.</p>
<p>[Tell what?]</p>
<p>[How many months have you not received your pay?]</p>
<p>[We take cash after discounts. We receive our pay every month. Can we still delay pay when fighting bandits?]</p>
<p>This big, dark fellow acted like a fool, leaving those two guys not knowing whether to laugh or cry. They had to think of another clever way. That night, the big, dark fellow was led to another small room. He ate two big bowls of dry rice and a bowl of vegetable soup, finally filling his stomach. Then he lay down on a broken wooden bed, his eyes watching the dim oil lamp on the wall. Just as he was about to [doze off], a young woman came in from outside. The big, dark fellow's eyes lit up, and he perked up considerably. A strange energy flowed through his body, diminishing his desire to [doze off].</p>
<p>The young woman sat next to the big, dark fellow with a grin. The big, dark fellow immediately felt a heat rising from under the young woman. He really couldn't restrain himself. At this time, the young woman leaned even closer, which made the big, dark fellow almost unable to breathe from the heat.</p>
<p>[Comrade: We are really going to be good!] she said, extending her right arm over the big, dark fellow's shoulder. The heat from her face also gradually warmed him.</p>
<p>[Huh! Good! Be good!] The big, dark fellow answered half-understandingly.</p>
<p>[Tomorrow we will hold a welcome rally to welcome you to join the Red Army. Please give a speech.]</p>
<p>[What? What is a speech?]</p>
<p>[It means talking to the comrades.]</p>
<p>[Say what?]</p>
<p>[I'll teach you first, and you can go on stage tomorrow and say it.]</p>
<p>[I can't learn it.] The big, dark fellow grinned.</p>

<h3 id="e208">John Barrymore's Strange Illness (Part 2) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>The natives said he was cursed by [Condor]</p>
<p>The doctors are helpless and fear that he will no longer be able to make movies</p>
<p>Although John Barrymore's health is far from what it used to be, he heard the doctor say that he was getting better, so he actively started working again. This spring, he filled a car with travel equipment and took his wife and two children to the mountains of Yucymytos to play. He slept outdoors at the foot of the mountain and ate in the shade of the trees. The doctors thought that was his only chance to regain his health. When he came back, he immediately started working, shooting the Columbia Company's [Twentieth Century Express]. Because he was plagued by illness and the work was too hard, by the time the director finally called [Cut!], he was too weak to stand. So he immediately took his wife and children on his large yacht and went to rest in the Alaskan Pacific Ocean. That was his first time in the Alaskan sea. He caught salmon and played with bears there. After a while, he came back again. When he came back, he passed through the harbor of Wen Guhua, so he ordered the anchor to be dropped there, took out his fishing gear, and fished there. Unexpectedly, while he was baiting, his finger was pricked by a fishhook. By the time he returned to Los Angeles, the finger had festered. When his finger was first pricked, his wife, Doris Costello, had treated him initially, but it didn't help. His hand continued to swell, and the pain gradually increased. His body temperature also rose day by day. At first, he was confined to bed. After a period of treatment, he felt better and could leave the bed. So he listened to the doctor again, got back on his big yacht, and set off for a long-term rest in the Alaskan sea. That was his most recent trip.</p>
<p>The doctors told John Barrymore that even if he felt better, he should not immediately resume work. However, everyone knows that the Barrymore family is one of the most hardworking and able to endure suffering. John's brother, Lionel Barrymore, suffered from painful, swollen rheumatism for almost sixteen years, with both legs behaving like paralysis. In those sixteen years, he never had a moment free from pain. His sister, Ethel Barrymore, also suffered from endless pain from time to time. She suffered from arthritis, and her kneecaps and other joints swelled up from time to time, causing her unspeakable suffering. Although her illness has not been cured, she still performs on stage in London every day.</p>
<p>If John Barrymore never made another movie, of course, it would not have any impact on him economically. All his equipment has been arranged in advance, so he will not feel materially deficient again. He was very poor when he was young, so his preparations were particularly thorough. He grew up in a family of actors, but his family was very poor. When he was sixteen, he ran away from school to study art. Because his father thought he had an inclination for art, he scraped together some money and sent him to France to study oil painting. Soon he ran out of money and returned dejectedly. He worked as an illustrator at a newspaper in New York, but he was soon unemployed again. In his poverty and boredom, he returned to his grandfather's career as an actor, but it took a long time to gain some recognition in the theater world. Ever since he arrived in Hollywood, his luck has turned around, and he has been able to turn everything he touches into gold. Soon he accumulated millions of dollars. In addition, he is good at management, and he can never worry about poverty in his life.</p>
<p>A Condor bird, [Malangni], although locked in a cage, can control the fate of its owner and bestow upon him the blessings and misfortunes he deserves, as the natives of Galapagos say—to ask John Barrymore whether he believes such absurd and unfounded words, he would definitely say [Tut-tut—] but Malangni is always his companion. He carries it with him, feeds it himself, and treats it like his friend—he never abandons a friend. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e209">Review of [Fallen]—Jin Cheng <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In any case, the level of Chinese films has improved. This is how I felt when I saw [Fallen]. Of course, we don't say that this is a completely successful work, but under small-scale management, we see that the creators of this film (from the director and photographer to the actors) are working so hard and so sincerely on the art of film, which is worthy of our joy. Moreover, this film has good results in individual parts.</p>
<p>We can say that this and [Song of the Fishermen] have some similarities, at least in terms of subject matter. However, the subject matter here is too realistic at present, so the author of [Song of the Fishermen] can hear it, and the author of [Fallen] can also see it.</p>
<p>It is very obvious that the creators of [Fallen] are very sympathetic to the poor masses, and at the same time, they are very disgusted with the lascivious lives of the crumbling rich. So he used the method of comparing the rich and the poor to unfold two different lives before our eyes, so the tragedy of the poor won the sympathy of the audience.</p>
<p>Of course, in many cases, the lack of expression methods is revealed, that is, there is no appropriate technique to express what they want to say through the art of film. The main thing is that the story is too long and too much, so that only a very long story is heard, and not much of the dramatic part is seen. Secondly, the playwright has too little organizational power, and there is no way to organize a lengthy story. At the beginning, two lines were unfolded at the same time, and a nanny brought the two lines together, but when writing about the third generation, we saw that the playwright had no power to closely develop the two aspects to the end. Here, except for the fact that the young lady of the rich family ran over the coolie of the poor family with a car (of course, this was very accidental), there was almost no relationship between the two. Moreover, in the end, the side of the rich was simply abandoned. Only the side of the poor was seen, desperately stretching the story.</p>
<p>We have to point out that there are too many themes grabbed here, and the film of ten thousand feet or so simply cannot accommodate them. Moreover, there is no center of gravity, and the result is that many materials are displayed in a disorderly manner.</p>
<p>The playwright only superficially grasps social phenomena, without uncovering the essence. So he only understands the rich people's desire for pleasure in warmth and fullness, and the poor people's sad lives. The rich people's sins contrast with the poor people's suffering, but he lightly lets go of the broken hands of the Jiuhua Yarn Factory and the car accident that killed Yongfu, etc. (Of course, there is a relationship of inspection here.) In this way, only the tragic fate of the poor is seen, and the growth of tomorrow is seen in today's China, which becomes the regret of the work, although the playwright pointed out the collapse of the rich.</p>
<p>The playwright's grasp of the central consciousness is fully expressed from the beginning when writing about Yinmei's lasciviousness to later when he quite sympathizes with her. As for the unclear introduction of the characters, such as the appearance of the neighbor being too strange, etc., there are more small mistakes, such as when Tang Xueqian is crazy, she clearly shouts A Qiao, why doesn't Fan Xuepeng know that she is his own mother?</p>
<p>For the meaning of [the Spring and Autumn Annals blames the wise], we have pointed out a lot about the script. At the same time, we find the playwright's efforts to improve and vividly depict reality commendable. Moreover, the playwright's intelligence is manifested in many places.</p>
<p>Although we say that the above points are the responsibility of the playwright, the director cannot have good editing, does not know how to be economical, and cannot reasonably grasp the dramatic parts and give full play to them, while some parts are stretched too long, which are the reasons why the work is not brilliant. However, the director is very hardworking. He treats every scene very sincerely, but he is not able to grasp the dramatic effect. There are several good scenes here, such as the collapsed car falling in the mud, the machines in the factory injuring people at that time, and Yongfu's death. If it could be more economical, it would be very commendable. As for the relatively lively camera movements and the guidance of acting, he also works very hard. If Tang Xueqian packs her baggage and wipes her tears with the corner of the cloth, the long shot and the medium shot are repeated, which shows his poor editing.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Li Ying, Fan Xuepeng, Tang Xueqian, and Wen Zhiyu are better, as well as the neighbor's man and the prostitute's introducer (the woman with gold teeth). Although there are very few scenes, they are very realistic. The set designers and photographers have quite good results.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Reflections After Watching "The Way of Women" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>This is a film recommended by dozens of educators and praised by Shanghai children for its happiness. It takes family and education as its themes. Indeed, the influence of family education on children is very important. Women are the backbone of every family, so they have the closest direct responsibility for family education. Therefore, recently, countries around the world have been advocating the idea of "virtuous mothers and good wives." For example, the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, he is an ardent advocate of the "virtuous mother and good wife" system. "To love a thing immoderately is to harm it," this is also a wake-up call for those who dote on their children without understanding!</p>
<p>"The Way of Women" is a film that emerges on the theme of family education, but it does not have a thorough understanding of family education. The story is very ordinary, and the screenwriter's avoidance of the important and dwelling on the trivial in modern children's education is, of course, undeniable. He wrote about Baosheng's love of sweets, so he repeatedly showed him chewing sugar on the screen, especially ending with closing the window, which clearly shows the screenwriter's cowardice.</p>
<p>The director, Chen Kengran, is very dedicated in this film. He handles the story in a very organized manner, which greatly helps the development of the plot. The angles of several shots are also used very cleverly.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Xu Qinfang powerfully portrays a "virtuous mother." Hu Yixing is also a very good talent, but it is a pity that the director did not use him correctly here. The other actors are generally passable.</p>
<p>Film is generally recognized as the eighth art, and it bears the mission of social education, so we are definitely not just running to the cinema for entertainment for two hours. We want to have more important educational significance in addition to entertainment.</p>

<p>— Li Xin</p>
<p>Newland smiled at Mrs. Mingott with sympathy. For more than a decade, she had been the female czar of New York society. With her protection, who would dare to spread rumors and make trouble for Ellen? The next day, Newland Archer sat in his law office, waiting for Ellen to come in. He was the youngest member of the law firm of Letterblair, Lamson, and Low, so all the cases that the older partners didn't want to take were handed over to him. But this time, he was very satisfied with accepting Ellen's commission, although he couldn't help but feel some trepidation. Soon, Ellen arrived, and Newland looked at her and felt that she had a different kind of charm than the night before, even more beautiful than he could remember. Her beauty was alive, constantly renewing, and emanating from within, he thought. He sat across from her, and while he was flipping through the documents, he was wondering what made her so different from other women. He thought about it, and the first thing was her dress—simple and quiet. Compared to other women, he felt that they were dressed too luxuriously and decorated excessively, which made them seem vulgar. But it wasn't just about clothing. Her inner peace was also what made her different from others. Compared to her, others seemed either noisy or dull. Ellen said, "I've rented a house on Twenty-third Street." Newland expressed surprise and said, "Rent a house? Alone?" Ellen said, "Of course. That's the only way. I understand my relatives' attitude towards me—they're all the same, except for Mrs. Mingott. But, Newland, I'd rather be free." She smiled again and said, "When I've finished decorating in a few days, won't you come and see it? Come with May?"</p>
<p>A few days later, Newland did go to see her new house, but he went alone. After that, he went to Ellen's house every day, as if he had official business every day and Ellen had documents to sign every day. Ellen's new home, like her personality, had a special simple charm and a kind of warm, pleasant, quiet taste. There, one could find spiritual rest and soulful enjoyment, which was clearly different from the magnificent, wealth-pressuring atmosphere of other places. One day, he was on his way to Ellen's house when he passed a flower shop and saw a bunch of special roses—the petals were particularly deep and the color was particularly bright. He thought that they were the flowers for Ellen, so he bought them and took them to Ellen's house. When he arrived at Ellen's house, he gave her the flowers and stood in front of the fireplace, silently watching her put the flowers in a vase. He suddenly had a feeling and said, "Ellen, you shouldn't live outside alone. You should think about your family, those who love you, those who are willing to protect you." Ellen listened and looked at him strangely, saying, "Newland, I often think about them too. But—those women—they won't understand—because they've never felt—that need." Newland didn't understand and said, "Need?" Ellen sighed and said, "Yes, Newland. Please don't reject me from a thousand miles away like others do. It seems that no one here is willing to be realistic. They're all pretending—" She suddenly couldn't continue, she stared at Newland, and then said, "Newland, some women are content with an ordinary life, but I don't want to hide it from you. I am a special woman, and I must have love—I must be loved... Are you thinking that I am too... what, after I said this?" Newland quickly said, "No... I think that's very upright and admirable. I have never met a woman who can talk so frankly." Ellen said, "Newland, thank you, luckily you are still a sensible person." He slowly walked over, put his hand on her shoulder, and looked down at her eyebrows. His head slowly lowered, hugged her tightly, and kissed her fragrant lips, kissing her fully. At first, she couldn't help but press her delicate body tightly against him, letting him kiss her, but after a while, she stretched out a hand, weakly waving, trying to push him away. She panicked and said, "Go, Newland," she sobbed, "You'd better go now." She didn't wait for him to speak, had already turned around and ran upstairs. (To be continued)</p>
