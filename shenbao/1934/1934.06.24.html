<h3>海軍軍縮之三角對立</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>英美日三國參加海軍軍備縮小會議之預備談話。已在倫敦開始。究竟結果何如。吾人細察此三國非公式發表之意見。卽可窺見其槪要。現在先就英國論。在原則上彼固欲盡其所能。以保持世界現狀。然在歐洲大陸絶不願法國勢力之過度强大。法意在地中海對立爭霸之舉。日趨露骨。英國雖未作左右袒。而其利用法意衝突。以維持直布羅陀海峽及蘇彝士運河特殊航權之心理。固不可掩。至於英德關係。亦顯與戰前不同。蓋德國今日雖不無遠略。然實力有限。反對蘇聯。徒託空言。其本意則在如何脫除凡爾賽和約之束縛。德人願望。早爲英國所審知。故不惜示惠於德以抑法。遠東方面。英人不願美國經濟勢力之擴張。尤不願蘇聯之東出。故處處予日本以便利。乃不知此種策略。竟助成日本獨霸東亞之局面。甚至有威脅印度之勢。英國旣不能聯美以制日。又不甘自居於失敗。乃擬添造巡洋艦及其他補助艦艇。以自固其在遠東之旣得利益。</p>
<p>日本對於海軍技術問題之討論。如主力艦之縮减。重巡洋艦之限制。飛行母艦之廢棄等等。均認爲係華盛頓與倫敦兩次會議之過失。蓋在日本立塲。此類問題之提出。將引起英美之恊同。而自陷於孤立境地。於是改換策略。提出其所標榜之軍備平等原則。並明白表示日本此刻尙無西侵之意。至於印度及英國直轄殖民地之市塲問題。亦願與英國次第恊商。以緩和兩國商戰之敵意。考日本之目的。無非欲徐行其大陸政策。一方破毁英美合作。而便其稱霸於西太平洋也。</p>
<p>美國開拓市塲之企圖。不及往昔之急進。華盛頓當局深恐因海軍問題。重惹糾紛。故提議延長倫敦海約。以證明其未有積極對外之意。卽如歐洲各國不還戰債。美國除提出消極之對策外。亦迄無任何積極之表示。於此足見美人心理决以消弭國内經濟恐慌爲先務之急也。因此心理之存在。故對中國祗聲言維持門户開放主義。對菲利濱且放棄特殊權益而允許其獨立。惟匪。島獨立。能否名實相副。而不致受日本覇權之威脅。則尙爲疑問。　菲島頗多開發餘地。而與臺南相隔僅一衣帶水。日人挾其政治上之移民政策及經濟上之傾消政策以俱來。菲人必將無以自保。美國雖有要求英國一同保障菲利濱中立之傳說。然因英　本身之矛盾。總亦難期有成。預料一九三五年海軍軍縮會議之結果。　使三國對立之愈趨尖銳化而已。</p>

<h3>營合喬治告英人　勿忘重大使命　確立政策挽回戰機　其𢡠志應晋及亞洲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日英前首相營合喬治以似火般熱烈之情緒、在視察報發表公開函件、號召英國民族、勿忘其在歷史上所享受之優越地位、而思所以在國際政治立朝塲上盡其傳統之使命云云、喬治氏稱、英國人民最近似已忘却其前此之高尙理想、但今日歐洲大禍臨頭、若欲化凶爲吉、則英國人民非恢復其前此之强烈而公平之政策不可、今美國之手足已爲其内部之糾紛所東縛、故央國今日必需重建其歷史上之使命、確立堅决明晰及易於爲人了解之歐洲政策、庶迫在眉睫之戰禍、可以避免云、喬治氏復稱、法國對於英國無黨派之超然態度、素無諒解之意味、且有時竟被誤會爲英法友誼之蔑視、但「吾人前此加入歐洲大戰、並非因吾人之親法、亦非因吾人爲反德、吾人之向德宣戰、不過因世界之均勢已爲一九一四年之德法成危害、正如在十八及十九世紀中歐洲之均勢爲法國所危害者等、吾人必須奉行歷史所賜給吾人之使命、吾人在已往、已屢次拯救歐洲之自由、但今日吾人之職志不能僅囿於歐洲一處、而應以吾人寛仁之態度、普及亞洲、孤立實爲辱沒吾人巳往尊嚴歷史之厲階、」喬治繼復指明最近英國政策之兩種大錯語、（一）凡爾賽條約之各簽字國、無論德或法均應遵守其義務、尤以减縮軍備爲要、此條竟被遺漏、（二）對於日本之態度、實屬軟弱可痛、以致將國際聯盟之威信陷於萬刦不復之地位、喬氏復稱、將來新戰爭發生之日、英國之干涉可以預先决定戰爭前途之命運、凡英國之所與者必占最後之勝利、前此英國政治家不知運用此種事實、以致英國今日在國際政治立塲上之威信、已降至最低之限度云、喬治氏末謂、在今日之世界、各國政治家如李維諾夫如墨索里尼如希特勒以至如巴爾都、其地位之重要、亦已遠過於昔日、但各人手中之牌、俱不能與英國手中所持者相較云、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<h3>英美談判暫停　靜待美答覆英要求</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據今日東京消息、日本報紙稱、如日本在明年海軍會議中不獲修改五·五·三·比率、則日本將宣佈廢止倫敦海軍公約與華府公約、然後單獨進行其以國防爲目的之海軍程序云、英美海軍界中人聞此恫嚇、深以爲憂、聞日本現反對海軍會議停開、又聞廣田外相曾告内閣、日本將反對海軍會議在日内瓦舉行云、聞日本反對蘇俄參加海軍會議、已不如前之甚、日本殊願計論俄·德·西班牙·以歐洲之立塲出席會議之問題、倫敦路透外交記者今日探悉、如日本在目前海軍初步談判中提其海軍均等要求、則美國或將表示如此將令任何海軍會議難以舉行云、同時英美代表團間之海軍初步談判、業已暫停、以待華盛頓方面對於英國最近要求之答覆、聞英國之要求、内有建造大批小巡艦與飛機一條、美國專家現正研究此項要求、陸續以結果報告華盛頓、大約下星期中美海軍部卽可審查　事、而凖備答覆之、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）據一般認爲消息靈通之人士言、日本似將要求意義最廣汎之海軍平等權、易詞言之、卽日本意欲使其海軍勢力、能在太平洋上超越所有其他各國之海軍、以此一點、恐卽足使海軍會議爲之擱淺云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）貴院有力者對高橋藏相之責任可分論、其意嚮大抵如下、高橋藏相所以唱大藏事件之責任可分論者、意在不累及其他閣員、且極力縮少與政局之影響、然大藏事件被疑者之凟職事件如果明白、則標榜肅正綱紀之現閣、應速表明進退、（二十三日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）林陸相昨日質問小山法相、促小山法相從速結束財部舞弊案、係受軍部荒木派之催迫、聞日政界上層階級力避政變、因最有力之首相候補宇垣大將受陸海軍强硬派之攻擊、已逃返韓京、荒木大將一派所推舉之平沼男爵又遭重臣財閥及政黨聯合軍之攻擊、亦不能上台、其他之候補者均有一長一短、甚難實現故力倡財長單獨責任論、以避政變、如政變不可避免、則推齋藤重上台、避免國内之大紛亂、聞法西斯派脅迫小山法相嚴究到底、以至捕鳩山前文相爲止、其目的在於破壞政黨政治甚明、政界内情十分陰鬱、（二十三日華聯電）</p>

<h3>宋子文報告　考察西北經過</h3>
<p>會國經濟委員會、二十二日上午開第九次常務會議、由常委宋子文報告考察西北經過、原文如下、</p>
<p>「本人此次赴西北視察、最要目的、在實地考察本會在西北之各項建設工作、今天先爲撮要口頭報告、以供討論、至本人對於視察西北一切印象、以後另具書面詳細報告、</p>
<p>（一）水利本會覧箊　西北歷年旱荒、故注重於水利建設、而陜西水利、尤以產棉區域之涇惠洛惠兩渠爲重要、是以對於兩渠積極規劃、趕先修築、查涇惠渠原爲華洋義振會與省政府合修、已費一百四十萬元、在二十二年份、灌田三千餘頃、亟應改善、以收全效、爰擬由會以二十五萬元、作爲修補改良之流動基金、預計今冬竣工、可灌田五千餘頃、</p>
<p>關於涇惠一渠、本人視察後、有下列意見、（一）該渠係臨時興修、注重以工代賑、故一切工程計劃、多欠完善、尤以管理方法不良、而小支渠之用水、多任農民自由、以致耗費水量、並冲淹公路、（二）十九年大災之餘、民力未蘇、水捐收入甚少、以致養渠經費無着、此後應改良管理、認眞徵收水捐、其所得欵項、不但可以培養本渠、並可推而興修其他水利、本人對於此點、認爲非局部問題、因該渠修成後、農田漲價數倍、（以前每畝五元、現在已漲至每畝三十餘元、徵收水捐、以供維持及推廣其他水利之用、至爲公允、果能辦理妥善、樹立模範、成效昭著、不難引起國内外商民之注意、投資於其他水利工程、　政府財力有限、如能鼓勵商業上之投資、則則北巨大之水利問題、始有具體解决之望、惟行政院曾有命令、水畝捐之徵收不能超過本渠自身之修理費、愚見以爲亟應商請行政院予以修改、現定此項水畝捐用途、除養渠外、餘欵得用於其他水利之開發、斯項辦法、實施甚易、蓋西北受益水利人民、均樂輸將、雖陜西人民、災後情形略有不同、然兩年豐收、如取費從輕、亦易辦理、洛惠渠計劃、原係省府計劃、引洛水以資灌漑、其灌漑範圍、亦係產棉重要區域、灌漑以後、其生產力與涇惠區域相同、現在業已動工、兩年完成、可灌田五千頃、原預算數爲　百四十餘萬元、本會於本年份、擬投資七十五萬元、作爲流動基金、另由省府按月撥二萬元、至完成止、其不數之十餘萬元、於明年由本會籌撥、並由本會與省政府合組水利委員會、曁設水利工程局、負責辦理涇洛兩渠工程事務、</p>
<p>導渭計劃關於陜省各項水利計劃甚多、最堪注意者、爲導渭計劃（一）寳雞計劃、爲德工程師巴爾克所建議、大致在寳雞山谷積水、以供電力、卽以電力將渭水引灌北岸高原田地約九百萬畝、（據其他工程家計算、僅有二三百萬畝、）並將所餘電力、供給各種工業、及將來隴　鐵路西蘭段火車發動力之用、以本人觀察、其費用達八千五百萬元之巨、非目前財力所許、而電力之供給、尙有待於工業鐵路之發展、爲現時計、祇能以灌田爲主體、則每畝引灌成本、合十七元或竟至三十元以上、以視目前西北各省水利計劃、平均每畝僅合一元至二元左右、殊不値得、是以巴爾克計劃、如西蘭鐵路通行以後、方有重新考量之價値、（二）李委員長儀祉等有關於導渭另一計劃、以二百萬元經費、擬灌漑一百餘萬畝、此項計劃、以國家目前經濟能力上觀察、大有研究之價値、</p>
<p>綏遠民生渠民國十八年、因救濟旱災、由華洋義振會與省政府合力興修、總計用欵八十六萬餘元、預計灌田約百萬畝、因當時重在急賑、未經詳細測勘、以致渠床坡席過平、流緩多淤、並經大水冲塌多處、現已完全成爲廢渠、經本會派員踏勘後、認爲或能局部補救、現正進行詳細測勘、能否着手、须待測勘之結果如何、此項渠工預算、曾由本會議决、撥給流動基金三十萬元、倘補救辦法確定、可灌田六七千頃、</p>
<p>本會水利計劃、原以涇洛兩渠爲限、惟此次視察甘肅實况、頻年遭遇水旱災祲、人民困苦異常、皆因山地崎嶇、氣候乾旱、境内雖多河道、大半不能利用、古渠亦均淤廢、認有亟爲經營之必要、查黄河附近、一經灌漑、可變爲水田者、據工程師計算、工作甚易、可灌一百八十餘萬畝、經與朱主席紹良商量、如本會能借撥五十萬元、先就輕而易舉之工作着手、可灌田六十萬畝、而農民自願每畝每年攤還一元、於一二年内、將此項借欵收回、作爲流動基金、輪流推修其他水渠、則四五年内、甘省可增沃地二百萬畝、以防旱備荒、用欵少而成功多、</p>
<p>寗夏水利寗夏黄河利、早有甲於天下之稱、此次視察舊有古代渠工、比較完整、不似陜甘之破壞無餘目睹秦壩漢渠唐渠、千餘年來之工程、依然保存惟經孫殿英戰事、民間損人綦巨、如政府用施賑辦法、各别救濟、不如以工代賑、設以　十萬元、擇修重要渠工、可灌田十餘萬畝並得參用十五軍兵工、完成必速、效率更宏、</p>
<p>此次在寗夏見古代水利制度之精密、利用水利之經濟、令人驚歎欽服、因此推想、秦隴古所稱爲富饒之區、其水利制度必與寗夏相等、而今日貧困若此、皆由於歷代戰事、罔顧民生、以致水利廢弛、遂演成連年荒旱巨災、因而感到此後國家建設西北、最重要者、無如治安與水利也、</p>
<p>靑海靑海水旱之災、較少於陜甘、目有古渠存在、間尙可用、而該省人口稀少、大都爲遊牧生活、水利部份、現無急切之需要、</p>
<p>（二）公路路北各省、近年來興築公路　甚爲　　尤以楊主任虎城·馬軍長步芳·馬主席鴻逵最爲努力、本會目前以政治上及經濟上重要關係、選修主要幹路兩綫、一·西蘭綫、二·西漢綫、西蘭路本由蘭洋義賑會以工代賑興修、嗣經本會補助二十萬元、粗具路型、因缺欵停工、已修橋梁涵洞、多已塌毀、坡度多須繼續削減、此路在西蘭鐵路未成以前、爲西北與沿海各省及歐亞國際交通重要幹路、蔣委員長極爲重視此綫、屢奉電催業已分段興工、擬以八十萬元完成之、其重要工程如次、（一）減低坡席、（二）橋梁根基負重力十噸橋面負重力七噸半、皆以貨車爲標準、（三）西北地質、多爲粘性紅泥、一遇大雨、則泥漿難行、不能通車、晴後行車、又復易於損壞、根本補救辦法、惟有全路舖用石面、但甘肅一段、除六盤山外、幾無石料取用、運輸石料以修成全路、需欵至少五百萬元、目前祗好擇全路最易損壞數段、勉强用石舖面、並沿路選擇五重要地段、置備扒形修路汽車五六輛、此項汽車應用、我國中山澳門汽車路、有良好經騐、逢大雨後、用以修路、極爲迅速而經濟、每日可修平數十里、經此設備、預計每年平均祗有一二十日不能通車、在平時三日可由西安抵蘭州、兩日半可由蘭州抵西安、如此則西北交通、便利增多、</p>
<p>西北貨品運外大道　爲沿黄河經由靑甘寗綏至包頭啣接平綏鐵路、此係貨運交通最便利之途徑、惟黄河運貨、祗能順流而下、且一年内、僅有數月可以通行、故及早組織西蘭交通綫爲急要之圖、西北各省限於財力專門人才、又限於省界分域、公共汽車不易辦理、本會承蔣委員長之命、及陜甘省府之請求、擬以四十萬元辦理西蘭汽車運輸、目的在溝通靑蘭重要貨品之運輸、以達隴海綫、並照火車制度、按班次開行、以利商旅</p>
<p>西漢路西安至漢中公路爲經濟上國防上之要綫、由西安至寳鷄已有不甚完整之汽車道、茲擬利用此段、接連興修寳鷄至漢中之幹路、初步測量、業已完成、並已派出細勘測量人員二隊、限期確定路綫、及施工辦法、尅日興修、本路本年經費、擬撥三十五萬元、本會以現有力量、擇定此二項工作、專心致意經營之、並承甘肅朱主席、陜西楊主任、撥派軍工八九千名、恊助建築對於兩路之進行、裨益不少、</p>
<p>（三）衛生西北對於衛生事宜、較各省落後、除都會粗具衛生治療機關外、其省内各地、一無設備、人民幾不知衛生爲何物、本會擬在西安·蘭州·西寗·及寗夏·各設衛生實騐處、並擇重要城市、酌設分所、對於各該省已有公共衛生治療機關、領導改進、並輔助擴展、又如陜北鼠瘟屢發亟宜設立衛生實騐處、以資預防、總期爲西北數</p>
<p>千萬人民、樹立衛生是礎、培成强健國民、</p>
<p>西北各省近代醫術素不發達、其原因有二、（一）地</p>
<p>方貧苦、外省醫藥人才、不願西去服務、（二）西北子弟能赴外省各大學醫科求學之機會甚少、而少數人士能自備學費赴外求學者、又溺於東南或國外生活之舒適、不願再回桑梓服務、故爲根本計、與各方面商酌、如能將上海同濟醫學科及工程科、移設西安俾西北子弟能就地求學、而又不爲外省奢華所習染、如此可樹立西北醫學之基礎、並可造育工程上必須之建設人才、在同濟學校本身、每月政府本有巨欵補助、如遷西安只須房舍建築費而已、該校處於學校林立之上海、其存在與否、關係無多、如能移設西安、其造福於西北人民、實非淺鮮、</p>
<p>獸醫及改良獸種西北以畜牧爲大宗、而獸醫機關、可謂毫無設備、每年獸疫之損失、雖無確實統計、約計牛羊死亡之損失、其價値必在千萬元以上、故牧畜之根本問題、首在防疫、現本會擬在上項西北各省公共衛生機關内、增設獸醫實騐專科、並在蘭州設立血淸製造所、惟全國獸醫專家、祗有五六人、除擬選聘本國專家外、更擬聘請在菲洲、安南·印度·富有經騐之英法專家四五人、分任甘靑兩省獸醫事務、並擬在蘭州設獸醫學校、挑選軍隊優秀士兵、及地方子弟、務求普及於滿蒙回藏人民、卽以中外各專家爲教授、俾獸醫智識及技能、普遍邊省　查本會畜牧預算、原定四十萬元惟經此次考察、以爲畜牧初步基礎、先從防疫入手、目前數年中、暫以獸醫爲主、而改良獸種爲副、迭與各專家商量、爲集中力量便利進行起見、擬將西北衛生及獸醫經費合併辦理、原定畜牧之四十萬元、以一十萬元移作水利增加經費、以三十萬元作獸醫及改良獸種之經費、故西北衛生及獸醫原定預算三十萬元、現將公共衛生獸醫及改良獸種合併辦理、其經費約爲六十萬元、</p>
<p>（四）農村建設查西北各省農村凋敝窘迫、亟待救濟、本會財力有限、祗可擇陜西首先着手、因陜省爲產棉要區、禁種罌粟、改植棉田、以抵收益、尤爲要圖、本會棉業統制委員會、對陜西棉產業設分所、力謀改進、而生產運銷信用等合作事業、均有待於擴充、涇河區域、利用涇思渠灌漑、種植棉田、壟畝相接、該處地帶之合作事業、已有上海中國交通等銀行、及公共團體提倡進行、而水渠以外之麥田、佔全省十分之九、無人顧及、經與省府會商、擬由本會籌撥二十萬元、省府擬分期籌集五十萬元、卽以此爲基金、或自行放欵、或用爲銀行放欵之保障、銀行得恃以增多放欵限席、則麥田旱農、獲益良多、本會所費之欵雖不多、但如各商業銀行、因此保障而能放出數倍之欵、其結果自較本會直接放欵、效用益大、</p>
<p>以上各節、爲此次視察後所得關於本會工作之感想、本年度西北建設費、大會於三月間在大綱上、原有規定、茲擬提議在可能範圍内、修改支配如左、</p>

<p>法院通過儲蓄銀行法案後發表談話如下、「本日大會通過之儲蓄銀行法案、孫院長交付討論時、可謂全塲一致通過、並認爲應迅卽實行、故卽日由院呈送國府命令公布預料七月起卽可實行、因原法規定公布之日卽行施行也、至於取締萬國中洗各儲蓄會毫無顧忌、於存户利益、必無損失、此節詳細意見、本人之禁止理由中、政府對有獎储蓄之各項担保品、應嚴厲監視之、財政部方面、當必有詳細辦法耳、如此使利權外溢之巨大資財、得以拀回、並使各銀行之正當儲蓄得有保障、一面國家旣有獎勵正當儲蓄之方法、則各銀行亦可於儲蓄業務上大有發展也、」</p>

<h3>蔣委員長將不來滬　定明日由京逕行赴杭　是否返奉化抵杭再定</h3>
<p>新新社云、關於軍委會蔣委員長來滬消息、昨據全國經委會常委宋子文語新新社記者、蔣氏定於明日（卽今日）離京、逕行赴杭、視察五省公路、將不來滬、至是否　奉化原籍、聞俟抵杭後再定、并悉蔣委員長由京啓程時期、至早須在今日下午、蓋以蔣氏預定本日上午向中央軍官學校訓話云、</p>
<h3>宋子文談　秋凉入川考察　建設銀公司决七月一日成立　我國入超現銀未必大量流出</h3>

<h3>秋凉入川</h3>
<p>宋氏首談、本人赴四川考察之行、雖早經决定、惟須過夏後、俟秋初天氣稍凉、方可成行、至關於建設銀公司之組織、凖定於七月一日正式成立、内部工作人員、大致業已内定、將來成立以後、究先開始何項工作、則尙待詳細計劃排定、方可從事進行、</p>
<h3>拉氏返華</h3>
<p>嗣謂、國聯對華技術合作聯絡員之拉西曼氏、何時返華、尙未接彼來電報告、至經委會顧問孟納氏之秘書、渠因另有一部份工作、須返美一行、此次在日本登岸、純爲路過性質、並非啣命特往、</p>
<h3>棉麥借欵</h3>
<p>宋氏繼談、關於美棉麥借欵、一切均照修正之合同、按照合同規定、於五年内還淸、就中麥與麵粉之類、自第四年起、亦可如數歸還、</p>
<h3>提高銀價</h3>
<p>旋記者叩以美提高銀價案、業經批准、中國現銀、其將大量流出乎、宋氏當發表其意見、謂余固從不信中國會因美國之提高銀價、致將大批現銀流出、余與金融界日有接觸、未聞彼等對此有甚恐慌、國人每誤會入超出超、直接影響現銀之流出入、其實入超未必卽使現銀流出、因此中常有一部份爲華僑匯欵也、</p>
<h3>複本位制</h3>
<p>有叩以一部份銀行家意見、主張實行複本位制、以金銀併用者、宋氏答稱、實行金銀併用過去有不少國家曾作試騐、結果並不佳、以後如何、固不可測、惟中國並不存金、若實行複本位制、必先購買現金、是則目前並無此需要、大可不必、</p>
<h3>顧使回國</h3>
<p>宋氏末談、駐法公使顧少川（維鈞）先生此次回國、係自動請假、緣顧氏已請假四五次、今始獲允、駐法使館開支較繁、卽其他各使領館、亦同有此困難、最後有叩以外交及華北通車通郵、並黄紹雄之南下等問題者、宋氏均以不知作答、謂此次晋京、純爲經濟委員會預算案之討論、對此等問題、固未嘗與汪院長等氏談及、恕余無可奉告云云</p>

<p>申時社云、德國駐滬新總領事克利克氏、業於前日到滬、並接見記者記者發表談話、申時社記者特誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>德不承認僞滿</h3>
<p>克利布氏關於前傳德將承認僞滿問題、首先答記者云、關於所謂滿洲國問題、現德國雖已脫離國聯、但吾深信德將採取與國聯同樣之步驟、吾人决不承認僞滿、且吾人對於國聯、現仍負有相當義務、絶不致有承認僞滿之議、</p>
<h3>重入國聯問題</h3>
<p>關於德國重新加入國聯問題、據克氏表示、目下非無相當可能性、惟德國政府與人民所盼望者爲國聯須尊重德國意見、將來加入與否、卽以此爲先决條件、至於最近本人抵滬後、外間頗有傳謂德將對華實行積極政策者、此說殊非事實、余敢斷言、德國固極注意最近發展中之遠東問題、但尙無積極行動之意、希德拉氏雖對於遠東注意、但目前仍傾全力於歐洲云、</p>
<h3>俄德關係趨向</h3>
<p>克氏繼談、德俄邦交改善之趨向、謂德政府深願與蘇俄發生友好關係、惟蘇俄現行之政治組織、與希德拉總理下之德國政治制度不同、同時有其他經濟上之種種原因、致德俄親善、時生阻碍、至於軍備問題、德國固有各方面之原因、將不願作絲毫之退讓、德國國内政情、已較從前改善、共黨勢力、亦漸減少云、</p>
<h3>僑民歡宴克氏</h3>
<p>克氏抵滬後、曾連日參觀各主要文化機關等、昨晚六時、全體旅德僑、特假大西路一號德國學堂、舉行盛大宴會、歡</p>
<p>迎克氏云、</p>

<h3>本年春季　統稅收入激增　每月均有增加三月份爲最多　現正竭力發展將與鹽稅相埒</h3>
<p>我國統稅、自十七年開始征收捲烟統稅以來、其後經財部稅務署、先後辦理棉紗·麥粉·火柴·水泥·薰烟·機製酒等統稅、未及七年、稅收年有增加、新新社記者頃由稅務機關、探悉財部稅務處、對於統稅、現正竭力進行發展預料不久當可與鹽稅相埒、本年第一季全國統稅收入、各月均有增加、一月份增一百六十餘萬元、二月份增二百餘萬元、三月份增二百七十餘萬元、其增收原因、約有下列三點、（一）加稅自去年十二月五日起、增捲烟火柴水泥三項稅率、除火柴水泥爲數無幾外、捲烟一項加稅後、驟增大部收入、（二）冀晉察綏各省統稅、前由財部河北特派員公署辦理、除捲烟一項收解國庫外、皆由河北當局留用、作爲軍政各費、自去年十一月起、設立冀晋察綏區局、所有統稅收入、一律解庫、統稅收入、因此增加、（三）我國出產薰烟、在濟南蚌埠許昌</p>

<h3>綠茶售淸</h3>
<p>我國茶葉種類、計分紅茶·綠茶·茶磚三類、外人因嗜好不同關係、均喜購紅茶解渴、綠茶雖味極淸香、惟飲者殊屬寥寥、本年茶市情形、似較上年特異、屯溪·歙縣·遂安·等路珍眉針眉綠茶、業已銷售一空、國外需要甚旺、實</p>
<p>開茶葉界之新紀錄、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>動物有沒有本能？（一）</h3>
<p>丨丨答汪德明君</p>
<p>汪君讀完郭任遠着：「行爲學的共礎」後，對於行爲學者不承認「本能」和「意識」引起了很大懷疑，汪君認定「人是有本能的」同時汪君也「很尊重本能說」。這到底誰是誰非呢？汪君自己不能自决、因質之我們。我們覺得這一問題的提出，雖然不免失之專門，但「本能」之說對於一般人的印象素深，能　這個機會來討論一回，諒也不是無意義的事罷！俱爲解釋人的「本能」前，我們應討論動物的本能，因此我們把問題稍爲擴大了一點。現在先就方法論略加討論。</p>
<p>動物有本能是一般心理學家所承認的，但行爲派的心理學者獨加以反對、尤以郭任遠先生來得最澈底。本能果然會因行爲派的反對而失去存在的意義嗎？這是很値筣討論的問題。但若要想從現在心理學各派的研究和理論中得到圓滿的解决，是很難的，因爲各派有各源的立塲和方法，各派都執着自己的是而反對他人之非。所得到的結論，常是片面的。</p>
<p>我們自然不能否認：每一派的心理學家對於心理學都有其特殊的貢獻，但同時，他們那片面的，形而上學的方法論使他們不能把握事物的全面，以致將結論引導到極端的危險的方面。行爲派也同樣提供了許多有價値的研究，同時也因爲行爲派的特殊的方法使它達到了很奇怪的結論，卽本能的否認。</p>
<p>因此，要答覆究竟有沒有本能的問題，最好先就行爲派的方法作一個批判，指出什麽是正確的研究方法。把握住了正確的方法，讀者便可以在研究當中下正確的判斷，而不致於看見了一個奇怪的結論便莫知所措了。</p>
<p>行爲派之所以有價値，是在於它在心理學</p>
<p>中應用了唯物論的，澈底的實騐方法。心理學到了行爲派的手裏，便成了完全客觀的實騐科學，它將心理現象也看做一種物質現象，看做一連串的刺激和反應的過程。因此行爲主義者認爲心理科學的研究應該是應用物質的刺激以求動物身上的物質的反應行爲，刺激和反應的研究，便是心理科學的根本基礎。行爲主義者放棄了内省派的主觀的觀察法，而把心靈當做與物理化學同樣的東西去處理。</p>
<p>使心理現象與物理化學聯繫起來，這是行爲主義的大功績，因爲高級的（心理）現象是不能與低級的物質基礎分離的，心理作用只是物質作用的一種屬性，物質不存在時，便也沒有心靈。從物質的研究中去獲得心靈的了解，是行爲主義的很大的優點。但是，行爲主義一旦把握住了物質的基礎，便以爲這低級的基礎就已經足以代表一切，於是否定了整個心理作用的特殊性，以爲除了刺激和反應的過程外不更有什麽。本能，意識，都可以還元爲刺激和反應的現象，它本身是毫無一點意義。</p>
<p>依據這樣的方法論，行爲主義者便否認了本能的存在，而將本能也看做刺激和反應的過程之一種，這種方法論，就是我們常常聽到的所謂「機械論的方法論。」把高級現象還元作低級現象，而抹殺了高級現象的特殊意義。更明白地說，機械論者認爲高級的現象，與低級的現象，只有複雜和簡單的分别，而無性質上的差别，卽只有量的差别，而無質的差别。所以，認爲本能與刺激和反應的過程是同樣的東西，不過刺激和反應只單純的刺激和反應，本能則是一連串的複雜的刺激與反應而已。</p>
<p>這種方法論，也是形而上學的。何以爲形而上學呢？就是它抓着了事物的一面，而忘却了該事物的另一面，它把所抓着的一面看成死的，固定的，而不知道這一面的活動性，不知道這能够轉化爲另一面。承認了刺激和反應的低級現象，而放棄本能和意識等高級現象，這就是形而上學的。</p>
<p>但形而上學的方法，在今日，早已不成其爲研究眞理的方法了。舉簡單的例子來說，水是比氫氧二氣都高級的，因爲水是氫氧二氣化合而成的化合物，但我們能說，水的性質與氫氧二氣是一樣的麽？自然，要研究水的成分，必須把分解爲這兩種氣體，但對於水的本身性質的認識，是决不能在兩種氣體的研究中得到，而須把整個的水拿來研究。我們不能因爲分柝出低級的氫氧二氣，便否認了高級的水的自的特殊性，由低級的現象複合而成高級的現象時，不單只是量的轉變，卽不單只是量的複雜化，同時性質也有了改變，而轉化爲另一種的質。</p>
<p>所以，研究高級現象而以低級現象的分柝爲基礎，這一點是可以首肯的，因爲高級現象是由低級現象所構成的，高級現象包含着一切低級現象的緣故。但一旦構成高級現象，則低級現象的性質便隠沒而成爲另一種的性質，這種轉變的過程，就是所謂的揚棄（Ａufheben）。這樣，對於行爲主義者，可以很贊賞他們那唯物的，客觀的，實騐的研究方法，但因爲應用這種方法，就要否認了動物的本能和意識，那是形而上學方法的作崇，如果打破了形而上學的觀點之束縛，則儘可以承認本能的存在，至少沒有否認的必要。因爲本能是比單純的刺激和反應更高級的現象，雖然也是一連串的刺激和反應所組成，但旣已成了連串，性質上便不單只是刺激的反應。例如：單純的刺激的反應只是機械的，盲目的行爲，而本能則是圍繞着一個中心目的而執拗地活動着的一種有目的性的行爲。旣然本能的目的性行爲與機械的盲目行爲不同，則本能的特殊意義就能成立，本能的存在便不容否認。（未完）</p>

<h3>怎樣鍜鍊我們的身體</h3>
<p>— 龔稽唐</p>
<p>西國有一位名人說：「愉快的精神，寓於强健的身體。」他的意思是：「有了强健的身體，才有愉快的精神。」</p>
<p>我想每個小朋友都知道，不强健的身體，最容易生病，生病是非常痛苦的。那麽怎樣才能使我們的身體强健呢？簡單的說：</p>
<p>一、不吃零食，飯不要吃得太飽；</p>
<p>二、不吃有刺激性的食物（如香烟，茶等）</p>
<p>三、不吃生和不潔的東西；</p>
<p>四、早起早眠，遊息有定時；</p>
<p>五、注意天氣的寒暖，增减我們的衣服；</p>
<p>六、常常洗澡，保持身體的淸潔。</p>
<p>以上幾條，想小朋友已經聽到學校裏的先生說過了。現在我所以再重復的提出來，就是希望小朋友牢記在心頭，天天去實行，使每個小朋友都有活潑健全的身體。</p>
<h3>顏回怎麽會成大賢人？</h3>
<p>— 金榮</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們知道幾千年前的一個大賢人顏回嗎？他是孔夫子的學生；在他小的時候，家裏是很窮的，那時他的同學們常常欺侮他，並且還說他偷東西，後來給孔夫子知道了，就想試試顏回的品行到底怎麽樣？</p>
<p>有一天在顏回的書桌裏，發現一錠銀子，還附着一張紙，上寫着「天賜顏回一錠銀」，他看了以後，就接着寫「横財不富命窮人」幾個字，仍放在原處。</p>
<p>孔夫子經過這一次的試騐以後，才知道顏回是一個好學生，所以將自己的才學都教給他了，於是他就成了大賢人啦</p>
<h3>互助</h3>
<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>淸早起來，靠着窗口望下街心，我看見了兩個可憐的人。小朋友，你說世界上最可憐的人是誰哩？不就是那些沒家可歸的，吃不飽，穿不暖的呌化子嗎？但是我所看見的兩個呌化子，却還是可憐人中的最可憐者；因爲他們一個是斷了腿的，一個是瞎了眼的！</p>
<p>斷腿的人跑不得路，瞎眼的人認不得路，這兩個可憐人却是聰明的。他們將各人的尙未殘廢的部分合了起來，便變成了一個健全的人了！</p>
<p>他們怎麽合起來的哩？就是：瞎子背着斷腿的人跑。瞎子是有腿的，而且是健全的腿；斷腿的人是有眼睛的，而且是健全的眼睛，這樣他們一合子起來，便成爲一個亮眼睛與有健全的腿的人了！</p>
<p>這情景打動了我，使我想到人是應該互助的，可不是嗎，小朋友？如果我們大家都能互相帮助，以我們的長處去帮助人，又拏别人的長處來補足自己，我們大家便能够在光明的路上大踏步的跑了；這樣，我們才不會退步，沒落！</p>
<h3>偉大的兒童</h3>
<p>— 秦雲先</p>
<p>兒童，兒童，</p>
<p>偉大的兒童。</p>
<p>我們都是國家的主人翁，</p>
<p>將來國家的整個命運，</p>
<p>都繫在我們的手中，</p>
<p>我們的責任；多麽繁重。</p>
<p>現在身體要鍜鍊，</p>
<p>現在求學要用功，</p>
<p>我們有了筋肉强壯的手膀，</p>
<p>我們有了智識豐富的心胸，</p>
<p>將來才可爲國爭光榮。</p>
<p>兒童，兒童，</p>
<p>偉大的兒童。</p>
<h3>汽水</h3>
<p>— 篤心</p>
<p>一天下午爸爸開汽水給明兒喝，瓶蓋一開，汽隨着水從瓶湧到杯子裏。於是，明兒問道；「爸爸我喝過汽水，可是，我不知道這是什麽氣，今天你能告訴我嗎？</p>
<p>「湧出來的氣嗎？告訴你這是炭酸氣。」爸說。</p>
<p>「炭酸氣，爸爸，我不要喝了，先生說過，這氣對於我們身體是有害的。」明兒搖搖手說。</p>
<p>「哈！你錯了，明兒，你只知道對於肺部它是有害的，但是你郤不知道對於胃是有益的，現在，你不是吸這汽而是喝這氣，吸，它是要到肺部去而有害的，但是喝，它是到胃裏去而對你是有益的，快喝吧，孩子，爸也來喝一杯。」</p>
<p>於是，明兒笑了，他連忙將汽水喝下去。不過爸又說了。</p>
<p>「明兒，我告訴你，這汽水不能多喝，多喝了，消化就會起不良的狀態，因爲它裏含有鹹性的小蘇打，世界上的東西，少吃總是多滋味的！」</p>
<h3>鞋子的來歷</h3>
<p>— 晶瑩</p>
<p>小朋友們，每天你們不是穿着鞋子嗎？但是，你們可知道它的來歷嗎？現在我來講一些給你們聽吧！</p>
<p>未發明鞋子以前的人民是沒有鞋穿的。終日，他們赤着脚在荆棘的山林間度那蠻荒的生活，不過國王的宮殿裏鋪着錦繡的地氈的。一天，是國王和鄰國的公主結婚的時候，於是，國王命令從宮前起鋪了十里路的地氈，自己站在上面迎候他那美麗的王后，等了很久，還不見伊來，國王心裏很焦急，於是他向前走着，當他走盡這十里長的地氈的時候，他聽見了一羣馬蹄的聲音自遠而近地疾馳過來，接着到了一羣馬隊，中間擁着他那美艷的王后，國王於是忍不住了，忘掉了一切跑去擁抱伊。後來，他回到宮中，郤發現了他的脚底被石子擦傷，他很是懊喪，但終於想不出一件妥當的辦法。不久這計策被他的王后想出了，伊召集了全國最聰明的人，把獸皮剪成和脚底相仿的樣子，用繩子來繫在脚上。於是國王很快樂，命令全國的人民都做這護脚的東西。</p>
<h3>地球離太陽多遠？</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>從我們兩脚踏着的地球，到我們兩眼望着的太陽，這中間的距離，據天文家的推算，有九千三百萬英里，合我國二萬六千萬里。這數目究竟有多麽遠，在我們腦裏，仍是不大明白；想像不出遠到如何程度。</p>
<p>現在用幾個比喻來說明，大家聽了，一定會驚異起來。</p>
<h3>用日數要二年半</h3>
<p>要是我們從一數到二百的數目，费上一分鐘：那麽我們一日一夜，飯也不吃，覺也不睡，一刻不停地數下去，每天二十四小時可以數到二十八萬八千；這個數目約當九千三百萬的三百二十三分之一。所以要把這數目數完結，必得三百二十三天，就是十個半月之久。這是一秒鐘也不停頓的。若是照現行的「三八制」來算，應加三倍的時間，就得三十一個月有零，也就是二年有零。你想這距離遠不遠呢。</p>
<h3>乘京滬車要行三百五十八年</h3>
<p>京滬快車每小時行三十英里。若照京滬車速度，從地球到太陽去，要走三百五十八年才能走到。假定在武昌起義時動身，要到民國二百五十七年才能達到太陽，近觀太陽的奇景呢。</p>
<h3>乘飛機要行五十四年</h3>
<p>走得最快的要算飛機了。若是乘每小時飛行一百九十七英里的複葉飛行機，由北平到南京，只消三小時。但是從地</p>
<p>球上飛到太陽，就得飛五十四年。小朋友！要是你今年十一歲，從地面上出發，一直飛向太陽那邊去，那麽等你到太陽上停下來，你已是鬚髮噃然的六十五歲的老頭兒了！</p>
<h3>上海市兒童幸福委員會，日前舉行家庭教育講座首次演講會中尙公小學幼稚生表演「努力抗敵」之四位小寳寳。</h3>
<p>— 灼階</p>
<h3>一個新生活運動的實行者</h3>
<p>— 上海民生小學學生葛守敏</p>
<p>何爲新生活？新生活就慢教我們怎樣做人。要國家强盛，必須實行新生活；要實行新生活，必須先訓練我們自己。</p>
<p>你想一個新生活運動的實行者是誰？不是政治上的偉人，也不是軍事上的英雄，也不是思想靈敏的發明家，却是一家國貨商店裏的小學徒。他每天起身很早，工作很勤，對於他的師長很是尊敬，對於同事很是親愛，對於淸潔也很注意，並且他還很用功，早晨在店門未開時，还讀一小時書，可惜他因位卑職小，晚間不能早睡。假使他生在有錢人家，將來眞可以做一番事業。</p>
<p>這個小學徒，他已實行了新生活。我們快快起來，實行新生活運動。</p>
<h3>靑蛙的變化</h3>
<p>— 鈍</p>
<p>閣閣閣　閣閣閣，</p>
<p>我的肚皮白，我的背皮綠。</p>
<p>小時有尾巴，大來光秃秃，</p>
<p>先入水，後登陸，</p>
<p>稻田我保護，害虫我捕捉。</p>
<p>閣閣閣，閣閣閣。</p>
<h3>最簡單的活動影戲</h3>
<p>— 糜書同</p>
<p>材料白紙，鉛筆，剪刀。製法以剪刀剪一寸半闊，五寸左右長</p>
<p>的白紙二條，把它們疊在一起，然後用鉛筆在上面一條紙的左端畫一個哭臉，在下面一條紙的同一端畫一個笑臉，再將上面的紙條繞鉛筆捲一下，使它有些自動捲縮的彈性，這樣就可開始玩了，玩法將紙條疊齊在桌上，右手壓住紙條的右端，用我們的鉛筆順着紙條左右的移動，那時你會看見一副一忽兒哭，一忽兒笑的面孔，好像在發瘋。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們可以在紙條上自己另外畫别的東西，也有一樣的興趣。這個遊戲很簡單，不過有幾點要注意，第一，白紙須稍硬，否則無捲縮的彈性；第二，圖應畫得淸楚，並且上下二紙條上的圖應符合，否則將看不淸楚。</p>
<p>夏令衛生小談座</p>
<h3>攤頭上的食物</h3>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>小朋友，夏天到了！在馬路的兩邊，你們可以看見許多的攤頭，攤頭上所擺的食物，甚麽扞光荸薺啦！糖梅子啦！花生糖啦！···花樣很多，實在是不計其數。</p>
<p>講到攤頭的設備，只有一魄木板，和一副能够挑動行走的擔子；擔子裏除了出賣的食物以外，其他是甚麽都沒有。擺攤頭的人，把出賣的食物放在木板上，任它沙灰積上去也好，蒼蠅停上去也好，只要食物賣去就算了；衛生問題是根本談不到。</p>
<p>因此：歡喜在攤頭上買零食的小朋友：當你們買的時候，先在食物上面檢查一下：是否有沙灰存積着！是否有蠅卵存在着！這些都是在買吃以前應當要注意的事。假使在食物上發現有沙灰和蠅卵存在着，那末你寗可忍一忍饞涎，不要去買來吃；因爲你不留神的買來吃了，小則肚内不快，大則就要生病了。</p>
<p>最後：我希望歡喜攤上買零食的小月友們：趕快改了這不良的惡習，不要再到不講衛生的攤頭上去買東西吃。</p>
<h3>貓和狐狸</h3>
<p>— 承昭</p>
<p>有一次，貓和狐狸同坐在森林中談天。</p>
<p>狐狸說：「不論什麽重大事情發生，我都不以爲意的。因爲我有種種的妙，可以解决一切困難啦」。</p>
<p>狐狸又說：「貓女士，假使你突然受到人家的侵犯或脅迫時，那你將怎樣處置呢？」</p>
<p>貓微笑地回答狐狸說：「狐先生，我祇有一條計策，如果這條計策沒有用，那我只有一死而已！」</p>
<p>狐狸皺着眉說：「女士，我很替你憂虚，我想教你幾樣妙策，但倚賴人家也不相宜的，我們還是各自當心自己罷」</p>
<p>狐狸的語剛剛出口，立刻有一大羣獵狗併着全力來襲擊它們倆了。</p>
<p>狐用伊的唯一的敏捷身手，爬上樹去，靜坐在樹枝上。</p>
<p>狐狸妙計雖多，但不能躱避，於是被獵狗咬死了。</p>
<p>小朋友，安全的計策，不在乎多的，你們看狐狸的死，就可以知道呵！</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>蠶寳寳從小小的黑子裏孵化出來：幾闪睡覺，幾次蛻換外衣；黑的黄的體軀，變成亮晶晶雪雪白的肥胖寳寳，爬上蠶山去，吐絲作繭，自己躱在裏面。不多幾天，它又出來了，這時成爲有翅不會遠飛的蠶蛾，在紙上產蛋了。</p>
<p>秧田裏的秧針，都怒長起來。靑蛙利用它的後脚，跳來跳去：張開它的大嘴，許多小蟲兒，總葬在它地腹裏。於是得意地奏起凱歌。突地「哇」的一聲，這得意的哥兒，被一條蛇媽媽捉住，纏着；幾分鐘的過去，做了别人的麵包了。靑蛙呀！可憐的靑蛙！</p>
<p>蛇媽媽因爲腹便便，遊行也呆滯些；被小友見了，掮起竹頭，向蛇打去，正中着它的頭部而死了。蛇，還記起吃田雞的得意時嗎？</p>
<p>朋友，靑蛙吃小蟲，蛇吃靑蛙，小友打蛇，雖在是動物界的小事；但，世界上强權覇道，欺凌弱小，這正是給我們看的縮影，應該仔細地玩味！</p>
<h3>全世界的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 蕭劍靑</p>
<p>（一）這是印度的小朋友，他們住着的地方是非常的熱，他們大多赤身露體在太陽下面跑，或到海濱遊戲，他還留着很長的頭髮，用五色的布包紥起來。</p>
<p>（二）這是菲列賓的小朋友，他的身體黑得像朱古力糖一樣，他不穿衣服，下體常常掛着一幅布。</p>
<p>（三）這是美洲小土人，你看他的服裝是多麽好看，他皮膚是紅色的，他很喜歡打獵射箭和用烏羽來裝飾。</p>
<p>（四）這是埃及的孩子，他們住着的地方很多是沙漠，而且非常火熱的，但是他們穿了很大的衣服，更把頭包紥起來，他們的鞋子很像中國的鞋子。</p>

<p>婦女園地我理想中的未來生活專號</p>
<h3>寫在前面</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>凡是人類，只要不是白痴，都有他們的未來憧憬。</p>
<p>一個理想的守現，一方固需要個人的努力，同時與當時的時代社會，也有着密切的關係。若不顧時代的進展，社會環境的變革，而一味憑空幻構，那祗是痴人的幻夢而已。</p>
<p>現時代的中國，現時代的中國女靑年。處在這次殖民地的環境中，她們的理想中的未來生活，究意是樣？這是値得十二分注意的。丨丨也便是出這專號的動機。</p>
<p>徵文的結果，應徵者之多，出於我們意料之外。但遺憾的是：大多數的勤勞困苦的婦女，她們不但不能在這小小園地裏舒述他們的期望，連一讀的能力也尙未具備！此外或忙於生活，或不注意新聞，自然也失了機會。所以收到的稿子雖多，仍只能說是少數中的少數。不過在這少數中，亦可以看出幾種的典型，例如（一）迷戀於紛紅色之夢的，（二）憧憬於獨身生活的，（三）厭惡都市面要遯世於農村的，（四）僅要獻身於社會的，（五）以改造整個社會爲前題的。</p>
<p>中國究竟是中國，中國還是個次殖民的國家，有幾個女子能有美滿的生活？有幾個女子能找到相當的職業？田園鄉村，何處是安樂土？我們應往何處去，聰明的人，自能會得吧？</p>

<p>假使我已經出嫁了。我的丈夫當然很歡喜我。因爲現在他已經和我很親暱。很能了解我的。</p>
<p>在綠柳飄搖紅桃妍艷的遮蓋下。顯出了我和丈夫的住所。幽幽地寂靜着。能聽到的僅僅蟬的呌聲。在那裏我一人倚了窗扉。在結製他的絨線衫。忽聽得各各的響聲。原夾是他回來了。哦！不知不覺已經五點半了。</p>
<p>現在我不在做絨線衫了。在我手中縫紉的是小孩的衣褲。因爲我已經懷孕六月了。</p>
<p>過了多時的一個傍晚。他懷抱了他的小孩中吻着。他說這小天使是何等的可愛。不錯。自從我有了她也格外來得快樂了。</p>
<p>這是我理想中的未來生活的剪影。</p>
<h3>（二）</h3>
<p>— 聘賢</p>
<p>近來接觸異性，不由得羞澀起來，我驚覺着自己已是成熟的處女了，（鄉村的女兒童養在婆家，十來歲就和她的拜了堂哩！）</p>
<p>在獨處時，月下，花中，甚至夢裏，我預懷着將來，將來？</p>
<p>我當先審愼地選擇永遠的伴侶，我們的結合基於戀愛，不能屈服於買賣式的。</p>
<p>我底丈夫，好是一個智慧的，健康的，而能維持生活的靑年，不拘於何種職業，而無惡癖的。</p>
<p>假如可能，我離開公婆，和丈夫組織小家庭。</p>
<p>我們底寫字間裏充滿着國際譯報·科學·政治·文學等的名著；倘我底丈夫是商人，更有些商業新聞之類。</p>
<p>家中多做些蔬菜，鷄蛋等滋養消化的菜，在丈夫辦公回來，我用心做了菜端到丈夫檯上，丈夫忙着下箸時，我想：他會體味出妻子的好處。</p>
<p>但我願將家務交給一個妇傭，自己去找相當的職業。</p>
<p>我們當然會生孩子的，倘在我第一胎生個女孩，有人問時，我不願意聽見丈夫嘆着說：「只是个丫頭」！良好的女兒等於良好的男兒。</p>
<p>當我們是閒着，我底頭倒在丈夫底懷裏，孩子底臂擁着我底腿，丈夫嘴裏哼着雪菜的情詩，或是長恨歌：「在天願作比翼鳥，在地願爲連理枝！」</p>
<p>我們都知愛國，關心國事，愛用國貨。</p>
<p>孩了無論男女，送他入適合於社會須要的學校，我每天給他們一個甜蜜的吻，他們報我以孝敬。</p>
<p>貞操男人須與女人相互保守，不幸丈夫和一個少女，或誰家的有了端的，我不辭和他立卽仳離。</p>
<p>最後，世界上沒有不散的盛筵，若我先丈夫而死。我答應丈夫續娶，反過來也是一樣。</p>

<p>— 珩</p>
<p>啊！說來是慚愧又慚愧。我理想中的生活，幾乎每天在我腦際憧憬，但是理想永祗是理想。</p>
<p>像失了舵的船一般，在人海之潮裏，度過了我過去底夢一般的生活，苦痛，悲憂，··我幾乎有好幾次想改造我的心理，更變我的理想來適應環境，但是不能，永不能，我祇是希望，永希望着！</p>
<p>我希望能有一天脫離我大家庭的傾軋</p>
<p>，同他去組織一個能够設施我們的理想的小家庭，來度我們同詩一般的生活！</p>
<p>在天剛亮的時候起身，整飭處理家務以後，率領我二三個孩子往公園裏去享受大自然的無上的享受：自己行一下柔體操，然後教着他們玩球，放小船，看書報，··消磨這上半天（當然大一些的孩子須送入學校，午餐是得自己料理）。</p>
<p>下半天担任半天小學校的校課，增加一些收入，稍資補助。</p>
<p>夜間，在他的指導下讀些書，增加一些必要的知識，一方面督促着小孩子們</p>
<p>溫習日間的功課。</p>
<p>這是我理想中的未來的生活，亦許淺薄得可笑吧！</p>
<h3>（四）</h3>
<p>— 菁薺</p>
<p>我是從小就生長在都市的，可是我理想中的未來生活！却希望是在含詩情，蘊盡意，的鄉村，</p>
<p>前面有一望無涯的麥田，兩旁有小溪及垂柳，後面有葱綠的樹木，各種茅屋草，就在這種環境的當中，有一間茅屋，除了兩個窗户及一個門外，都滿生着爬山虎，裏面的牆是淡黄色的，裝着碧藍色的宮燈，全套奶油色的，小巧怕，精緻的，西式家具，當中掛着萬全之愛的慈母像片，臺上擺着慈母的書畫作品，我便做這間房子中的主人，用一個老嫗，養兩隻美麗的小貓，天明卽起，在田園中散步澆花，然後吃早點寫大小字，練行書，午飯後稍息直到吃晚飯，都是寫稿子，我是以賣文爲活的，其間若感疲乏便彈彈琵琶吹吹蕭，晚飯後同老嫗到鄰居農人家聽講故事神話等，每月進城一次省視雙親，看望親友，領取稿費，並希望時常遇見些意外的小事以調劑生活的平凡與枯燥。</p>
<p>此外再有一位品行高尙，多才多藝的異性朋友，做爲終身的知已，但决不與他結婚，而且不與他時常會面，只是時常通通信，做各種學術上的探討，算爲精神上的安慰而已，除此决不與第三異性交往，卽同性朋友至多亦不過三五人而已。</p>
<p>好了，我的未來生活能如此，便是我的理想實現了。</p>
<h3>（五）</h3>
<p>— 趙俊玉</p>
<p>我是一個十七歲的女子；定個在助產學校肄業的學生。我不希望將來做什麽政治界的偉人，社會裏的聞人，或是享受何等高貴的生活；但我也有一個前進的目的，這個目的就可以代表我理想中的未來生活是什麽。當然，這個理想在抱負偉大的女子們看來，也許是太渺小了。</p>
<p>這個目的是什麽呢？就是希望將來成功一個能够保持產婦和嬰兒健康與平安的產科醫生。</p>
<p>在科學不發達的中國，什麽都落在人家後頭，就是以科學方法來接生的產科學，也是在近年來才引起國人的注意，才有人提倡，有人來學習。但是在短時期的努力並不能使舊勢力傾倒於一旦：舊法接生還是根深蒂固，不易打倒；倒些沒有學識根據，完全聽天由命的老娘（卽收生婆），還是充斥社會，佔着很大的地位。所以在報紙上不時可以看見許多關於老娘誤傷產婦的紀載，從人們的口中也可以聽見這一類的不幸的叙述，我曾親自看見一個親戚生產時，死在一個無知識的老娘手裏。這種可怕的現象，使我感覺我們女子實在有努力學習產婦，剷除舊式老娘的必要。因爲一個人的死亡當然是國家的損失，一個產婦和嬰兒的孱弱對於民族健康的影響更是極大的啊！所以我在初中畢業後，卽轉入助產學校學習，明年可畢業，畢業以後，我决定先在產科醫院裏實習幾年，用已有的書本知識的根據來作實地經騐的探討，那時候我想無論如何我總不至於糊裏糊塗的把產婦弄死了。</p>
<p>在這幾年中，我是在努力建築，實現理想生活的基礎，到了我已有相當能力之後，我就要聯合幾個到内地去開設一個產科醫院，同時以漸入人心的方法，宣傳科學接生的好處，和舊法接生的危險，能够在無形中打倒老娘的勢力，然後視能力而創辦一個或幾個助產學校，培養助產人才，取老娘的地位而代之。雖然舊勢力是很難剷除的，但人人能各盡其能，那末天下那有不能爲的事情！</p>
<p>這就是我理想中的未來生活，這生活</p>
<p>當然是極爲淸苦的，沒有什麽大希望的，但我則認爲能够做到一個有利於民族健康的產科醫生，並不是毫無意義的。</p>

<p>— 陳秀玲</p>
<p>「理想是美滿的，事實是悲哀的」。當然我也不能例外，理想中之未來生活，是逃不了美滿的理想的囉。</p>
<p>我理想中之未來生活，是希望做一個教員，天天與那一羣，活潑可愛，天眞無邪的兒童們厮纒。</p>
<p>因爲兒童們是未來的國家底主人翁，他們是亟待着良好的教育來教育，更亟</p>
<p>待着良好的培養來培養。</p>
<p>雖然，我的學力並不高深，經騐更談不到，因爲我現在還在高中師範二年級求學呢，但，我將不辭辛苦的要去幹，因爲這是我的興趣及志願，尤其是責任。</p>
<p>做了教員，可以在晚間及早晨的餘暇里，努力進修我所要進修的學問，更要研究出一個好的，新的，教育制度，來替換這現在的使我不滿的教育制度。</p>
<p>星期六下午及星期日，到公園裏去散散步，或者約了同事到郊外去玩，這樣，一星期的工作的疲勞，又可在這裏輕輕的送掉，再有餘暇，還好讀書，或者邀幾個平日比較伶俐的兒童，大家來彈彈琴，唱唱歌，調劑調劑這教育生活。</p>
<p>教員生活，是最美麗的生活，我的理想中之未來生活，就是要過這美麗的教員生活。</p>
<h3>（七）</h3>
<p>— 璇</p>
<p>大約受父母的薰陶居多，無形中便也養成我這淡泊自甘，近乎想隠居的傾向，從小就不慕什麽浮華，長來這傾向似乎更明顯；我也曾在都市中居住過好些時候，都市的文明，絶不能誘惑我這山野之人，都市中緊張的空氣，使人呼吸了，全身的皮肉骨節，也會隨之緊張不適。經過這有力的試騐，更使我相信，我是不配在這氛圍裏生活下去的。我厭惡那種生活，我鄙棄那種所謂都市的文明，我需要的是簡樸，恬靜，安閒的生活，在目前國内如此紛亂的時候，這種要求，也許是該駡的，但這畢竟是要求，或說是理想，能否實現還不可知，卽使能實現，也須在若干年後，年老了，再遇這種恬靜的生活，也許終究是可恕的。</p>
<p>我的故鄉是一個半鄉村的小城，雖不脫原有的村氣，但已染着了不少都市的習氣，所以對於牠，還是不歡喜的成分多，在將來，假如可能的話，要住在一個有山有水，很淳樸的鄉村裏，房屋足供起居應用，有廣塲可運動，週圍有地好種植，同居的是嗜好，趣味，相近的伴侶·最好一個年較長，一個較幼，年長的作事有經騐，有决斷，因爲我太少經騐，尤其少决斷·所以一定需要這麽一個人·年輕人比較有生氣一點，能伴着活動使我不會就老起來，我以爲一個人年歲的增加，不是最易使人老去的，只有缺少朝氣，那才危險，我怕見那些未老就暮氣沉沉的人。</p>
<p>每天除必要的工作外，有規定的時間讀書，有時間唱歌，弄樂器，有餘暇運動·屋旁的空地，供我們自己種植，我最歡喜這種農作，收穫的東西，供我們的衣食·或者有不給之虞，所以先得聚一點財產，作爲基金，在這理想未實現前，便着手積聚·</p>
<p>這是一個毫不奢望的理想，也許能如願，但假如沒有同伴，沒有基金，那麽理想永遠是理想，而我的身體也吸能混在人羣中浮沉了·</p>
<h3>（八）</h3>
<p>— 芳萍</p>
<p>我是自幼兒就從農村裏生長大了的，在農村裏，婦女地位的卑下，說起來着宣令人驚嚇丨我和母親，在數千年傳統的封建桎梏下面，曾嚐過不少的悲慘非人生的生活；一直到現在，由於國際帝國主義者的侵略和壓迫，農村日益陷入破產景况，而我們一般婦女，在生活的壓扎下，更過着猪狗一般的生活，在男人們受了氣回到家來，我們直可說是他們唯一憤怒發洩的對象，簡直他們的窮困似全是由我們造成似的·</p>
<p>在實生活裏，經騐這樣告訴着我：要我們不受舊封建勢力舊禮教的束縛，我們在經濟上必須不依附於男子，經濟和男子立於同等的地位；而一般婦女的解放問題，並不是一部份的問題，而是整個的社會問題，社會制度不求根本的解决，所謂婦女問題，也將無法解决，因爲首先就不能脫掉經濟的依附，脫掉作爲男子的私有物，甚而至作爲商品的緣故；首先就不能使大多數婦女，脫掉窮困，而享着眞正的人的生活的緣故·</p>
<p>所以，我將來的理想生活，並不是如一般太太小姐們所醉想的有一個幸福的理想的家庭，因爲這在我們已經成爲不可能的事，在現實上，生活已不允許我們做着這樣的好夢，而我們所希望着的，是要我們大多數的婦女有着眞正的人的生活，而這我是希望着要從整個社會問題裏去謀解决的！</p>
<p>所以，我理想中的未來生活，是我要從現在做起，極力地去克服我舊有的根性，堅定我的意識，認淸我在婦女中所負有的使命：在生活的實踐裏，我，同着和我同樣在生活幾重壓扎下的婦女，在未來的生活中，去謀得眞正解放婦女的路·</p>
<p>在將來生活中，我希望不作奴隸式的結婚，去淹沒了我這一生的「人」的意義，但在不妨害我的工作和有適當的機會中，也不妨結婚，至說到執福的家庭，那祇希望在人們都幸福了的時候·</p>
<p>祇要我是在「做人」的道路上前進，祗要在婦女的解放過程裏，我能盡够我所能做到的，使我們終會有做人的一天，這便是我理想中的未來生活·</p>
<h3>（九）</h3>
<p>— 鳳子</p>
<p>人類在極痛苦中還能够掙扎着生活，就因爲對於生活前途具有一種理想，能忘記過去，忍耐現在，希望未來的緣故。但是這種理想，因爲環境不同，各人有各人的理想，一個時候有一個時候的理想。記得民國十二三年我在師範學校讀書的時候，因爲讀了冰心女士的遺書超人等作品，及太戈爾的飛鳥集，加上當時很流行的一種文字，受了那種影響，我的理想中充滿着眞善美愛。其實那時我的生活是很窮困痛苦的，但因爲我内心一時被美化，把眼前身受的痛苦忽略過去了。自民國十五年畢業一直到現在，這八年中所經過和感受的，才使我覺悟到我的理想是錯誤的；我明白在現社會下是沒有什麽眞善美愛，不過是拿來粉飾這黑暗社會的，這種欺人自欺的幻夢，不願再做了。現在要明白我們是處於極緊張的生活中，帝國主義經濟侵略一天加緊一天，一班男子受經濟壓迫得吐不過氣來，而我們女子更是在重重壓迫之下，度着奴隸下之奴隸生活，還有什麽間情去做那悠遊風雅的美夢呢，但是我沒有完全絶望。我的理想是：</p>
<p>一·在社會上能有事做，經濟能够獨立。</p>
<p>二·男女應以志趣相同，情感相洽而結合，不受任何限制，誰也不得支配誰。</p>
<p>三·社會上有良好的託兒所及公廚的設備，使我們去掉這種家累，能專心做自己應做的事業。</p>
<p>四·於妊娠期生產期，能得有相當休養，在職業及薪資上不會受到影響。遺樣女子可做自由人。</p>
<p>我知道我的理想雖不很高，但是很難求諸實現，因爲個人的生活是整個社會的一角，要有合理的社會，然後才能談</p>
<p>到實現我理想生活的一日。</p>

<p>— 遼兒</p>
<p>「九一八」日本的鐵蹄，踏進了我的故鄉瀋陽城，那時我正在故都某大學的宿舍裏，做着甜密的幻夢呢！醒來時，已是有家歸不得了。創痛，慌張，憤恨，氣惱，塡塞了我心頭，但見同學們，有的頓足搥胸地，要去投軍，也有漢不關心地逍遙閒散。更有···這裏我不願再寫了，往事已矣，現在寄跡在這半外國的滬上的我，更有别種遐想：</p>
<p>「一九三四」，巳被時輪輾去了半截了，「一九三六」，不就在眼前嗎？死光，毒氣，細菌彈，毒針砲，不已是公開的秘密地在發明，在製造嗎？我們固然也大家在嚷着如何如何救國，但這樣的零亂的局面下，我們這些這樣無組織，無訓練的肉塊，怎樣來迎接這未來的大難呢？那個禍患來時也許是躱無可躱，避無可避呀，手無寸鐵的我們呵，自然只有以肉塊去拼啊！但也得有組織才興。</p>
<p>我遙望未來的雲霓是光明的。但得聯合來越過這死綫，這是我希望於最近的將來急該實現的生活。</p>
<h3>（十一）</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>像黄河裏的魚一樣，如果黄河泛濫，那麽不管大魚小魚，甚或是還在孕育中的魚子，全要受到同樣的遭遇的丨至多是程度深淺的不同。這是要看魚是在洪流的焦點或是尾梢。</p>
<p>人離不了人住着的環境和同時代的人羣，二十世紀的隠士也許不太容易當，而且好像也很少那種自命孤高的傻瓜了似的。人在爲眞理而掙扎的時候會是半點不猶疑，並且在堅固的集團中勇往直前。</p>
<p>如果人不是瞎或是聾，多少總對着這站在臨界綫上的混亂的人事感到點驚悸吧，在砲口刀鋒的近邊那無疑的會在射擊中嘶號的，接連着稍遠距離的冒着槍彈與利刃來營救，同時也就是自救。人總是關心着與自己一部分立塲有關的事，除非被迷魂藥蒙住了心，否則是不會漠不經心的。</p>
<p>在這黑暗與光亮的接頭，在這眞理與惡魔鬥爭的前夜，那急劇的大變亂是免不了逃不掉的，人也許要抱怨生在這變亂中的不幸，不過，不能說正是一種幸福嗎，這是緊而有刺激性的生活！</p>
<p>於是，在這大决門中，我們要凖備身手哪，不作壁上觀，丨當然，事實上也决不容許的。</p>
<p>女人好像是受着雙重的蒙布的盲人似的，但在這人類夢醒的時候，我們的蒙布要被去掉，光亮復現在我們的目前，對正與反兩條路的奔跑，任我們投奔。</p>
<p>事實又告訴我們是要奔向大多數人的公理的那方面，那裏是我們的有力的陣營，會給我們以鼓勵和勇氣，爭取那被搶了去的贓物，爭去那用血與肉奪來的公平。</p>
<p>不希罕苟且圖安的平靜與幸福，這世界不容你再安心遲疑不决，不容你再打瞌睡，不然你會被踐踏在砲灰中。</p>
<p>在崖的盡頭，在斷了橋樑的河岸上，斷然决定自己的路吧，人們會犧牲小我，站在大我的立塲上向前邁步。未來的光明是焦灼地燃着人們的心喲。</p>
<p>沒有英雄，只在萬衆一樣的大隊中，依據着公衆的信念開步走。</p>
<p>數不盡的小卒呵丨我也是其中之一。</p>

<h3>糧食　傳朝鮮在滬辦麥　期粉麥都趨漲勢</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見一致堅强之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回好一二角左右不等、故開價後、人心自然良好、更以兩日前洋麥回跌甚巨、市面竟未搖動、業内外之買户、心思自覺更健、并以廠家態度、大廠出數寂寞、致多數人推想、恐有不利空頭之舉動、因此買户步增、市面亦步高昂也、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、仍然步俏、半因大多頭之吸收、半因天久未雨、且多頭暗放流言、傳朝鮮買去小麥數百包、故多頭方面、益振振有詞、買氣愈湧、不謂南北豐年之後、竟爲業外人閙大市面、亦屬不可思議也、結果本月份較漲二分、七八月份漲二分七釐半、九月份漲三分、十月份漲二分七釐半、十一月份漲二分、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平定之象、以洋盤報價、芝加哥坎拿大祗回好一二角左右、故開價後、人心未加注意、各月份開價、無甚上落、迫至下午開盤、忽呈嚴重之激漲、因粉市旣見步高、市面又大放謠言、謂朝鮮在滬採買小麥、惟一查數量、祗有三四百包、如以地域言、如有需要、在北方收買、甚爲便當、今在申動辦、業中人均認爲多頭操縱之作用、不過有此傳言、市面遂爲閙大、自開價迄收盤、無不步步高漲、國内正値豐收、所缺者暫時無雨、而人心意庸人自擾、照此情形、恐又爲洋麥開一門户也、結果七月份漲六分、八月份漲九分、九月份漲八分、十月份漲六分、十一月份漲九分、現麥市面、中次平平、特高貨微好二三分、關徐州麥二元九角九分、蚌埠明光麥二元九角半、六合烏衣麥二元八角半、大橋揚州麥二元八角二三分、支塘蓬萊麥二元七角八分、蕪湖麥二元七角六七分、浦口麥二元七角七分、次七角半、太州麥二元八角四分、安慶麥二元七角六分、次七角三分、由福新去五千包、阜豐去五千包、信大華豐各二千包、</p>
<h3>河下米到少漲二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源又見轉稀、祇共到十七八號、（貨共二千六七百石）、其中尤以厚粳更少、僅三四號、故本街人心向上、店胃頗健、相互競先似恐不及之勢、售方乘機扳俏、一霎時間市况似有直上靑雲之槪、故其常帮蘇同南港等價、悉騰二三角、至於各帮晚稻、客帮包胃自初市開手、其北洋天津威海衛等客納意亦頗濃厚、計成交靑角宿貨一儎外、餘悉作罷、杜尖處此亦有動動、帶起五分、羊尖則仍定局、變元銷路尙好、續挺角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十四五號、河存一百三四十號、各貨銷路白粳早薄稻　勸、羊杜尖稍化、埠客尖白元交平、市形白粳加二三角、早薄稻加二角、羊杜尖緊起一角左右、埠尖緊數分、客尖及白元挺立之勢、</p>
<h3>客秈暢銷價昂</h3>
<p>▲内地與福州去胃突旺</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、初居平勢、斷因福州帮辦胃仍貪、新有内地帮與浙省溫台各帮到市問津、内地帮去胃之濃不亞於福州、且本街亦復暢辦、市乃立見上展、内地帮多時未有暢胃、今因天氣久旱不雨、農田不能下種、内地米價與人心趨上、故亟亟到申採辦、而囤貿客户亦復乘機收買、適目下到頭淡靜、市面隨見上升、惟市上存底尙足、内地帮活動又屬暫時性質、非如福州帮之久常性也、目下存米足敷需要、市價不易十分上漲、祗市上高米不多、故高糙、高機各秈均漲起五分至近角、全日開出各秈七千四百二十二包、除本街與浙帮辦去一千二百包外、均由閩帮與内地分去云、</p>
<h3>糖市　減稅消息影響糖市</h3>
<p>▲靑赤白銷路一致停頓</p>
<p>昨日糖市以關金頻跌、而連日所傳洋糖減稅說、又甚囂塵上、因此無論靑赤白糖銷路、一律爲之停頓、銷方恐市價有劇變、大都觀望不前、以致公會劃盤幾至虚設、昨市喊盤亦極紊亂、最大呌二十元半最小呌二十元三角、兼傳暗盤有小價做出、但無從證實、總之皆惑於减稅說所致、惟减稅實行與否、暫難斷言、各方均在暗中摸索耳、至於國產潮靑、存底確薄、而銷路尙長、卽使洋糖减稅實現、亦無多大影響、蓋現市尙非高價、兼之洋糖减稅、亦難廉於國產糖也、粤產之海南赤、因該處糖稅已有人包辦、且有於十八日實行加農產捐、故該處存糖大部份經轉香港、裝新疆輪裝下、昨已抵申、總數共有四千餘包云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭花子歉象已成</h3>
<p>▲陳貨因之突漲</p>
<p>蘭花子據漳州函訊、照現在新花情形、歉象已成、本屆收成恐僅一分之譜、故陳貨市價突見緊張、頂上全黄好貨、申市行方已肯出五十元高價、故號方昨電地頭　裝、不日或有運到云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紅茶形勢穏定</h3>
<p>祁門浮梁寗州等路紅茶、自新貨上市以來、走銷異常迅速、前因到貨擁擠、市盤雖曾一再跌落、但近日俄國恊助會洋行、因茶價相宜、又復大舉搜辦、市面轉趨堅挺、查現下祁浮紅茶、業已銷出四萬五千箱、佔全額十分之七、而花香一項、隨到隨銷、市價抬高至三十四五元、尤爲年來所未有、紅茶形勢、已呈穏定景象云、</p>

<h3>業餘消費合作社</h3>
<p>— 陶然</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌是日益深刻化了。一般購買力的薄弱和失業的日增，非但沒有减退，而且更有進一步一天天迅速地普遍地深入擴大的趨勢。不消說，我們這般市民是「首當其衝」，特别是我們這般職業界的俸給生活階級，尤有最先被捲進這個經濟恐慌危機漩渦的最大可能。</p>
<p>我們今日已是危立的經濟的恐慌的火山之尖了！</p>
<p>因此，我們更無疑義的，在這個恐慌危機尙未降臨到我們身上的前夕，我們是不容再爲顢頇。我們當怎樣未雨綢繆，來先事作一個凖備，以應付這將要降臨到我們身上來的恐怖的危機呢？</p>
<p>所以在這裏，我提供一個有效的辦法，獻給我們職業界的俸給生活階級的同志：</p>
<p>一八四四年，英國羅許特爾地方，有一批法蘭絨廠的職工，共同組織了一個消費合作社。他們的事業是；（一）設立一個全作商店，供給社員的日用品；（二建築或是購置公共宿舍，供給社員住宿；（三）製造社員的消費品，容納無職業的社員；（四）租借事購買土地，供給失業社員的耕種；（五）設立戒酒會，提倡戒酒。</p>
<p>把他們的事業歸納起來，我們可以見到牠至少有下列幾點的利益：（一）因爲合作商店所得的盈餘，依舊可以按照社員的購買額分還給社員，所以沒有消費</p>
<p>上的浪費，可以節省糜費，增加社員的購買力；（二）因爲有製造和耕種的生產事業，所以無職業的和失業的社員，可以暫時沒有爲了失業而發生的生活上的恐慌；（三）有公共宿舍，可以使社員的家庭間發生密切的關係，有合作互助的機會；（四）有戒烟戒酒的規定，所以有不良嗜好和行爲惡劣的人便不能入社，間接的可以改良社會道德和不良的風俗習慣。</p>
<p>其實消費合作社的效用，却斷斷不止這幾點，除了改善人類經濟生活和社會制度之外，它更可以在團體的行動下，有訓練自治，增進組織能力，扶助教育效能，發展文化事業等功能。因此在羅許特爾消費合作社成立以後，各地爭相仿傚，羣起組織，到現在全世界消費合作的數量已超越二十萬個以上，社員數有一億四千餘萬人。此種驚人的高速度發展，實爲世界任何社會運動所不及。然而在接受世界思潮最落後的我國，合作運動僅僅在農村裏面有着相當的發展，而在都市方面，却是寂寂無聞，卽使有，也只是寥若晨星！</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌的浪潮，已如洪水泛濫般在我們的脚下翻滾着了，我們的購買力已一天天的薄弱，失業的恐慌也常在我們前後左右跳盪着。我們此刻所處的地位，正和一八四四年羅許特爾職工所處的相彷彿，我們的環境已具備了組織消費合作社的急迫的需要，我們實有立卽起來組織業餘消費合作社的必要啊！</p>
<p>目前我們可以辦的事業，是（一）合作商店，供給我們的日用消費品，來節省糜費；（二）公共宿舍，供給我們的住宿，减少單獨租借上的許多浪費和麻煩；（三（）公共娛樂塲和娛樂室，供給我們業餘的正當娛樂消遣；（四）公共圖書館，供給我們學業上的修養，充實我們本身的力量：（五）和其他我們認爲需要舉辦的各種公共事業。</p>
<p>職業界的俸給生活的同志們：我们應當認識我們當前的危機，我們應當立卽起來作一番凖備工作，爲社會，爲自己不容我們再遲延下去了。</p>
<p>我們應當立卽起來組織業餘消費合作社！</p>

<p>— 寗娜女士</p>
<p>每一次，當我打XX婦孺救濟院走過，偶爾從那狹小的半開着的門裏瞥見幾個黄而且瘦的孩子們的時候，我的心便好象給某一種沉重的東西壓着。那是不可言說的人類同情心所喚起的悲感，這沉重的悲感壓在我的心上已經有好幾年了，而我沒有一時忘了牠，特别是瞥見了那在同樣苦厄的命運裏掙扎着的小生命的時候。也許這麽一天快要來到的吧！這大批大批受難的孤兒們，要跳出死一樣可怕的圈子，走到那偉大的「生路」裏去的！我是這樣希望着。</p>
<p>在我的故鄉，也有一所由幾個聞名的慈善家所創辦的孤兒院，那裏除掉像其他的慈善公所一樣的收容孤兒以外，還借着天然的影緻開闢了一塊孤兒院公園。公園所佔的面積並不大，但多產鮮花特别是菊花是牠的特徵。每當深秋的時候，那裏總有一連好幾天的菊花遊藝會的舉行，用不同樣的鮮艷的菊花堆成各種各樣的花山，花林，甚至是花的故事，同時在菊花業裏表演着精彩的遊藝。栽培那些花草的，修理那那公園的，都是被收容的孤兒們的工作。平常去那裏遊玩一次，每人都要買門票的，門票的價目是一毛大洋（據說，那筆欵子是歸當局安挿在孤兒健康方面的設備上），但你如果要觀光裏面的「奇蹟」，便得出特别費了。</p>
<p>在公園裏靠近孤兒們的寢室的地方，東西對立着兩座小山，山底下各有一個幽黑的地洞，這便是所謂的「奇蹟」。（而那公園甚至是那孤兒院，大槪都是爲着有這「奇蹟」而開設的吧，我是亭樣想。）相傳牠們是秦始皇時代留下來的「皇封洞」，因爲曾經在那裏面掘出過許多古瓶古錢古劍之類的東西，因此那兩個幽黑的地洞便被人珍視而且也寳貴起來，用人工的方法製造了兩扇鐵門封在洞門口，裏面一直朝下走也用石坡代替那斜斜的土坡。因爲牠們是一代英雄留下的遺跡，所以大家都抱着「一睹爲快」的心理爭先恐後的爭着去瞻望那「奇蹟」，六個銅板一個人的收入，聽說是可觀得很，但那是開始時候的事。後來日子久了，「奇蹟」也被人忘記了，那兩個洞便給蛇類作了巢穴。不知什麽時候忽在一陣謠言傳來，東邊的洞裏長了一株「靈芝草」，靈芝草是仙種，而那　洞也簡直變成「仙洞」了。因此，長滿了荒草的砌道上，遊人的脚跡又復遍滿起來。</p>
<p>不管那株「仙草」的來歷怎樣，但孤兒院當局對於這例外的營業的苦心是可見一班了。接下來，我們再看那地方的主人，孤兒們的全活吧：</p>
<p>地球圍着太陽永恒的轉動，那裏孤兒們的工作也一樣從早到晚沒有停止的時候。天剛亮，便爬下了他們的小板床（床由木架做成，分爲四層，睡在第二層以上的，便須用梯子爬上爬下），開始晨間的勞作，澆花，拔草等事情。早餐只是稀薄的組米粥，每人限定兩碗。上午像小學生一樣的分班上課。中餐和晚餐是一樣小菜的粗米飯，數量和早餐相同。一整下午便是他們參加生產的時候了。有的編籐器，有的編篾貨，有的織毛巾，在限定的時間内，每個孩子一定得完成多少東西，不然，就得挨打或者挨餓，卽令是六歲的小孩，也沒有可以逃脫那嚴厲的規則的幸運。因此，生產品是一天一天增加着，也很容易推銷出去，看那情况，貨價的收入大槪是不會在孤兒們的消費的數倍以下的。</p>
<p>孤兒們多半是沒有了父母由親戚們送了來的，進院的手續非常複雜。找到了「殷實」的舖保，還得要找得力的人的介紹信，孩子才可以進去。有的也有母親，但母親無力養活孩子，便託人送了進去，不過手續是比前者更麻煩，有時候還得花下一點錢。</p>

<h3>姊弟公司</h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>在歐洲大戰爆發的前夜，有一位五十三歲的小茶葉莊老板，死在英國喜佛爾特地方。遺囑將店事交付他女兒主持。那時這位依萊白克勒小姐，正是　十妙齡的時代，一些也不懂得商情世故，大家都料定這份小小店業，從此要關門大吉了。誰知她竟掮下了這副得担，和她的尙在學校裏念書的二位幼弟，居然與環境掙扎起來。到了今天，這份小小的店業，已擴充爲著名的白克勒有限公司，每年要做華幣一千萬元左右的生意，這眞是一椿使人興奮的故事。</p>
<p>當這三位姊弟接受他們父親遺下的一份小小店業，那時他們專以包裝茶葉爲業，借居於一座美以美會禮拜堂的二間地窖内。地方黑暗，空氣污濁，簡直是和地獄一般。後來白克勒小姐和加司金氏結了婚，放棄包茶的營業，改做包裝乾靑豆的生意，因此進益更加豐厚。於是她便頂進了一處較好的房間，從事營業。等到大戰告終，她的兩位兄弟，也加入一同工作。</p>
<p>一位靑年女郎，和二位初離學校的學生，坐在辦公室内，不知底蘊的人决不相信他們便是控制全店事務的主要人物。有一次，走進一位顧客，向加司金夫人說：「可否讓我見一見隨便那一位？」「好的，你可以見我，」她說。「是的，但是我要見一位懂得生意經的人員，」主顧鄭重地請求着。</p>
<p>爲了他們三位的年齡，都不像一店的重要人物，尤其是她的小弟弟，時常被外人當作寫字間的僮僕看待，因此他們不得不另請一位有年紀的人，來做他們形式上的經理。於是他們同心努力，生意一天發達一天，直至三年以前爲止。從那時起，他們便開始着手製造罐頭靑豆的嘗試，由姊弟三人，一齊工作。他們先派他們的經理，到發明　製造方法的科學家那邊去，研究了三天。但是終於沒有人來告訴他們怎樣去利用這個新發明。他們只好裝配了一副小小的製造罐頭靑豆的模型機，姊弟三人，連同了他們的經理，朝夕討論試騐，以期發現製造的秘訣。他們沒有專家指導，一切事情都是自己動手。</p>
<p>於是他們積聚了一筆巨欵，建築一座新工廠。他們的辛苦積蓄，幾乎完全投資在這毫無把握的新創事業上。萬一不幸失敗，他們的命運就此完結，所以大家益發苦心焦慮，謹愼將事。當他們開始製造的第一個星期裏，各地定貨單，像雪片一般的飛來，積壓在加司金夫人的檯上，足足有一尺多高。機器日夜轉個不住，以應顧客們的熱誠需要。姊弟三人從朝晨站立在機器旁邊，一直到夜，極少有睡覺的時間。他們一批一批的出品，來不及等它冷透，就此整捆的運到外面，去應主顧們的需要。</p>
<p>加司金夫人天天到棧房裏去檢騐靑豆，還時常趕到林肯省訪問農夫們，視察靑豆的栽植，還要管理機器，監督印刷，照顧庶務，眞是一身數役，從沒有片刻的閒暇。</p>
<p>他們現在計畫從明年起建造一座别的新廠，製造别種罐頭蔬果，希望每年做到華幣一千五百萬元左右的生意。</p>
<p>大家都相信那可憐的孤兒是在享受着非常豐裕的生活了，但誰知道那只是幻想呢？孩子們在裏面不停的受難着，笨重的手工業吞噬了他們天眞活潑的天性，那裏找不出紅潤的圓圓的雙頰，有的只是黄瘦的小臉和癩癬的頭頂，瘡癤更釘滿了靑蛙一樣瘦弱的軀體，沒有誰發一聲響亮的笑，也沒有誰敢放出一聲可愛的啼泣，而那樣管囚犯的看守兵一樣的教師，更從沒有向他們放過一綫柔和的顏色，孤苦的小靈魂在　宮裏受難着····</p>
<p>有一次，一個孩子得到教師的允許，到會客室裏去會見他的母親。母親驚異地審視着他沒血色的臉，孩子溫順地領受着生疏的愛撫。母親不知想起了什麽傷心地哭起來，孩子也器着伸出小手告訴母親：早上先生用木棍打過他。巧恰他們的教師打門外走過，立卽驅走了母親，重重打了那多嘴的孩子，然後將他關在一間黑房子裏挨起餓來。</p>
<p>母親們在外面不再歡樂的笑着了，孩子們在裏面不想再悽苦的工作着了。當着美好的天氣裏，他們從竹籬的隙縫裏窺見了那些有錢的孩子們穿着新衣，跟着有錢的父親在公園裏跳着笑着的時候，那對於他們是一種怎樣有力的刺激呀！　　事情終於發生了，兩個孩子乘着教師的不防，倫倫地從院後的山上逃了出去，但沒有多遠便被教師捉住了。據說那一次處罰特别嚴重，毒毒地打了一頓以後，還將他們送到那「仙洞」裏幽禁起來。孩子們哭着呌着被丢了進去，等到再拖出來的時候，孩子們沒有聲音了，最小的僅只六歲的那個，便在「仙洞」裏喪失了他受難的小生命，九歲的那個也只剩下最後的一口生氣了····</p>
<p>地球圍着大陽永恒的轉動着，孩子們在孤兒院裏永恒的受難着，孤兒院包圍在慈善的光芒裏永恒的存在着。</p>

<h3>蘇聯水上幸福會</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>發展水上運輸和水上救生的公共機關丨水上幸福會（Ｏsvod）丨已從以前的水上救濟會改組成立了。這後者是專力注意水上救生的，總共有會員四萬八千人。</p>
<p>水上幸福會在一九三一年始行改建成立，牠的章程和細則和從前的水上救濟會是完全不同的。牠的目標有新的修正；牠是把自己和全國其餘的人聯繫在一起，同樣努力社會主義建設的。牠的主要工作在帮助水上運輸的發展，鼓勵小本船的建造，和水手與司機的訓練等　　從過去兩年活動的成績已表明牠採取的目標之正確無誤。現在牠的總會員已有五十萬，而且大半都是很活動的分子。三千個地方分部是在過去兩年中建立成的。這些分部大半都是位置在近水區域的工人羣衆中。</p>
<p>在一九三二年的一個革命紀念節中，這個會舉行　一次羣衆檢閱。有四百種合乎這個會的活動目標的成績報告，同時舉行的水上競技的熱鬧又吸引了一百五十萬之我的　大觀衆。</p>
<p>在船舶修理的鬥爭中，這個會發動了二百五十隊人員參加，共修理了一百七十五條巨艘。爲了節省物質上的浪費和修船速率的增高，一種提高會員教育及技術程度的工作已進行過了。</p>
<p>在適宜於航行的春夏季候裏，這個會曾以最大的努力利用了所有的船的全部效用。屬於這個會的船，在那時期中共載了二百五十萬搭客，内中包括携貨的進城市的集體農民。</p>
<p>印刷的宣傳品也是大量的被利用着。在一九三二年，牠印了二十五種討論關於牠自身各種活動的通俗小册子。還印刷了十八種美術廣告，每種都爲量甚多，指示羣衆如何去救一個溺於水的人，以及如何節省燃料，如何免去擱淺觸礁等，</p>
<p>在碼頭和船廠裏，這個會每年要支出建造小木船和各種船隻（如快艇，汽船，救生船，滑冰船等。）的經費共六千五百萬盧布，又要花二百萬盧布裝配船上各種應用器具。約有三千個畢業生從這個會所舉辦的速成學校畢業出來，在通過理論和實習工作後，他們已被採用爲正規水上運輸的水手和舟子了。</p>

<h3>介紹職業生生半月刊</h3>
<p>— 也風</p>
<p>無意中在報攤上買到了一本職業生活半月刋的創刋號，看過了一遍，激起了我興奮的同情和工鳴，在這裏我應當誠懇地把牠介紹在我們店員們的面前。</p>
<p>開頭，我們要明瞭的，這個刋物並不是什麽文人雅士賣弄風騷的園地，也不是什麽職業教育家們用來教訓欺騙我們的工具，純粹是好幾位職業界的靑年所苦心創辦的，所以它的出現並不是偶然的把戲，正如在發刋辭上所說：「從本刋的名稱上，可以意識到牠是爲了職業界的人們而辦的，··在現代緊張的局面中，農村破產，帝國主義侵略的尖銳，經濟的恐慌，形成了店員大量的失業，在業的也是沒一刻不感到失業恐慌的感迫，··在物質··的壓迫下，爲了要解决我們切身的嚴重問題，爲了要揭開職業界的黑暗，暴露職業靑年慘痛的生活，來喚醒整個下層店員大衆自覺和前進，··」無疑的，它是一個時代的產兒，它在目下嚴重的時代下生產了，店員們在歷史上開始傳出了第一聲的呐喊，這呐喊，是怎樣的賜予我們店員大衆受創的心以一種鼓舞和安慰呀。</p>
<p>爲了完成牠宣言的任務，以配合我們生活上苦痛的音諧，在内容上的開展是現實的，充分的顯出了一張沉毅剛强的戰士臉孔。内面沒有輕浮的嘻笑，沒有無聊的談話，沒有玄妙的學理，沒有仁義道德的虚僞粉飾，有的是解說現社會罪惡的眞理，披露了我們生活上的血跡和淚痕，反映出職業界的獰惡的面幕。例如在職業通訊攔「我們的生活」這篇通信裏，由一個</p>
<p>玻璃廠裏的年靑練習生的脆弱悲慘的心裏，吐出對于他生活環境的哀號，對於一個無端受難的同伴傾瀉着同情的淚。他們小小的年紀，受着經濟的壓迫，就失掉了母愛，在經濟的鐵鞭下，挨受生活的刑罰。怪不得他要懷疑地問：「我們從娘胎裏就帶來罪惡嗎？」「絲廠裏」這篇通信是客觀地叙述工頭對於女工的壓迫和摧殘，寫出作者自己親眼看到的悲痛事實。看吧！他是那麽地悲嘆：「每天，每天，我看見無數的無智識的女工，被那自命爲管理階級的先生們蹂躪着，鄙棄着；每天，每天，我看見從殘破的農村裏奔出來一個個純潔的天眞少女，投向這個生產利潤剥削勞働者剩餘價値的機關裏來，又一個個被埋進墳墓；每天，每天，我又看見整箱整箱絲的出口換進成千成萬的鈔洋；每一根光亮的絲都染上了勞工們的血淚和汗漬，可是穿綢的人們却感到非常的舒適和輕快。」這情景，引起他無窮的憤懑，無途的徬徨，對天他的職業深深地感到失望了，一個有志的靑年，就關在這生活的鐵牢裏流淚了。文藝創作欄裏的「殘軀」（此期尙未完結）現實地描寫一個銀行職員因過度勤勞而致生肺病，等到他不能盡力於行務時，銀行當局就把他當個皮球樣踢出去了。其他的作品恕我來不及一一介紹。</p>
<p>憑着我的觀感，認爲這是我們店員大衆良好的讀物。祗要我們是個店員，誰都承認它是我們共同的舌頭和嘴巴，傳出我們共同的積憤和怨恨。牠是我們思想的先導，領導我們去判别眞理和欺騙。牠是我們知識的園地，培植我們前進的知識。所以，這個刋物是値得我在這裏介紹的。</p>

<p>加瑪兩河上），現在也已漸漸恢復；在那幾年中所毁壞的船隻，現在也已再建。這一方面的建設從一九二九年起已有了顯著的成長。救生船是從一九二九年的三百七十一艘，增加到一九三三年的九百六十一艘，其中大部分都是新建的。救生的用具，已從一九二九年的一千一百四十一件增加到一九三三年的二千二百四十九件。一九三二年在水中遇到危險的總人數之百分之九十三是獲救了的。</p>
<p>對於救生工作有了基本的認識，這個會爲了前途更有效的開展，已製定預算，徵求四千萬盧布的投資，好用來建造和修理各種救生的水上設備。</p>
<p>這個會的目的是要實現下面這個口號：「永不要有一個水上的犧牲者！」全部的救生工作是基於實現這個目標的觀點而建立起來的。</p>

<h3>教師地位降落之因</h3>
<p>— 在廉</p>
<p>教師在社會上地位的降落，是無可諱言的事實，我們不必引經據典，只要把教師的幾個渾名一說出，已足够證實了。如猢猻王，教書匠等都含有蔑視的意義。那末教師何以爲人所蔑視呢？推厥原因：第一由於教師生活的悽苦。現在一般人衡量人家的能力，每以賺錢的多寡爲基凖。教師的工作是繁重的，教師的報酬是很薄的。有的每月的收入不到十元，能有二十至三十元的地位算是難得的了。最多也不能超過四十元。在這生活程度騰高的今日，支配這個小數目，常感有「八隻瓶只有七個蓋」之苦。買得了米就沒有錢去買柴。教師只好自己省吃儉用。若是遇着减薪欠薪的年頭，除了束緊褲帶等待死神光臨一法外，沒有第二條路可走。</p>
<p>第二是師資無嚴格限制。「人之患在好爲人師」。爲人師的責任的重大，槪可想見。但話雖如此說，仍有好多不懂教育爲何物的人，忘自尊大的在講堂上口講指畫的說教起來，以致教育的成績不堪聞問。還有孜孜爲利的商人，遭受經濟的慘變而失業，也混入教育界。無論張三李四，只須略識之無，都可入教育界，這就益使教育界份子龐雜了。某名流說教員多如狗毛，這話也是實情的。可是把幹神聖事業的教師來與狗毛相比擬，這未免太苛刻了。</p>
<p>第三是教師位置無保障。教員生活可說是短命生活。有的學校的聘約有效期間爲一學期，有的爲一學年。聘約期滿，自問能蟬聯的可暫得安心。蟬聯的標凖，自然以校長對你的感情爲轉移，初無所謂有「服務規程」的保障。若是沒有蟬聯的希望，便又須向其他學校進攻，進攻不得，就有失業的威脅，失業的</p>
<p>小小專著</p>
<h3>西班牙的農業勞動者</h3>
<p>— 乃夫</p>
<p>最近外電所傳，西班牙佃工十五萬人實行罷工，聲勢浩大，「到處與民團鬥爭，死傷甚衆，彼等寗願使五十年來未有之豐穫腐爛田中，而不願接受雇主之要救，其罷工宣方中有云：吾輩忍飢挨餓，已閱兩年，縱再枵膓，亦屬常事。」（見六月十日申報）丨這是多麽壯烈而沉痛的呼號！</p>
<p>我們知道，西班牙是一個農業國，人口二千萬中，從事生業者約七百五十萬，業農者實占全生業人口百分之五○以上。但是土地的集中，世無倫比。全耕地面積的百分之六七，都屬於百赫克達以上的大土地所有者百分之二的人數所有。反之，五赫克達以下的土地所有者（百萬人）的百分之七六·五的人數，却只佔有全耕地面積的百分之七·四。這種情形，可由下表中看出來。</p>
<p>人數　　　　　　　　百分數　每人占有土地平均數（赫克達）　佔有總數　　　　　　　百分數</p>
<p>大土地所有者　　　　五○、○○○　　　一　四六四、○　　　　　　　　　二五、二○○、○○○　　五一、五</p>

<p>總計　　　　　五、○○○、○○○　一○○　　　丨丨　　　　　　　　　　四五、○○○、○○○　一○○、○</p>
<p>西班牙的農業關係，是以佃耕的普遍爲特徵，封建剥削的形式仍舊殘存着。二百萬的農業勞動者，大部分是完全沒有土地的，全靠每天的工錢維持生活。在某種意味上，農業勞動者直可說是農民與普羅列達間的一個中間層，因爲一般小農在重重剥削之下，日有農業勞動者化之勢，而農業勞動者自自則爲了尋覓工作，常不絶地彷徨於農村和都市之間。</p>
<p>自世界大戰以來，西班牙便永久陷於農業恐慌中，農民的革命和騷動，幾乎時有所聞。一九一九年的農民運動實達到了最高潮，據西班牙政府調查，是年佃工罷工事件竟達一百六十起之多。這種罷工運動，不消說是以農業勞動者爲主力的。而且每次的罷工都與工業勞動者的運動結合一致，常常有互相支持的同盟罷工發生。尤其自一九二九年以後，世界經濟恐慌的怒潮使西班牙的農業恐慌更加激化了，這使西班牙的農民尤其是農業勞動者更加陷於悲慘的苦境，不得不以必死的决心，發爲轟轟烈烈的解放鬥爭。</p>
<p>農業勞動者的失業是慢性的現象，工資水凖是極低的。而且農業勞動者一年就業的期間非常有限，大抵只限於播種和季節的工作。這反映到西班牙農業運動的時間的特徵。安達達亞洲的農業勞動者的平均工資，一九三一年爲三至四鉑色，該洲農業勞動者每年勞動日數平均不過二○○至二五○日，所以合計起來，年所得僅七○○至九○○鉑色而巳。一、○○○鉑色的所得極少見的。所以依三百六十五日計算，平均每日工錢只有二鉑色至二、五鉑色的上下。這就是單充一個單身漢的生活費還不够，那裏還談得到養父母蓄妻子呢？</p>
<p>農業勞動者的勞動時間很長，勞動延長至十二丨十四小時是極平常的事。至於對童工女工的虐使，那更是不待說的。</p>
<p>農業恐慌使農業勞動者的狀態更加惡化。第一，失業增多，住民减少，第二，名目物價騰貴，特别是生活資料的名目價格騰貴直接襲擊着農業勞動者。因爲他們不是農產物的賣手而只是買手啊。一九三一年夏秋之間，農業勞動者曾罷工强制大地主提高名目工資，但大地主却把生活資料的名目價格也更加提高了，結果勞動者的實質工資事實上反而降低了。</p>
<p>然而農產物名目價格的騰貴，對於農業勞動者固屬不利，對於貧農中農也是毫無益處。緣西班牙農民因作物（葡萄爲主要農產）的特殊性，大抵在作物沒有成熟以前就要出賣，以償還債務，支付租稅，購買農業經營上所必需的東西。他們在販賣方面根本是處於不利的地位。何况貧農中農的窮狀更因佃農關係而愈惡化。大地主常常作威作福，每逢佃約期限屆滿之後，總是隨意提高押金，增加租額，對於佃農在耕地上因勞動而增加之價値，一槪抹殺。</p>
<p>關於農民的窮乏和貧困，手頭沒有統計的報告，我們且舉實例來看。</p>
<p>我們看莫西亞州洛加和加特拉兩縣的情形吧。那裏無一年不有旱魃爲災，不用人工灌漑就不能生長任何作物的。然而這些縣的灌漑制度是完全崩潰了。這使這州的農業（主要是葡萄栽培）不得不陷於沒落，尤其是上列二縣。七年之間，洛加縣的農業人口竟自八○·○○○减至五○·○○○。加特拉縣的農業人口减少了百分之九○。兩縣葡萄酒生產自一九一八年的五三·○○○赫克脫里脫减至一九三二年的二·○○○赫克脫里脫。農產物總價値自三五·○○○鉑色减至二三·○○○鉑色，年來不安於生業的農民成千成萬的向都市中流出，要求救濟，工作，和麵包。像這樣的例子，是全西班牙到處皆然的。</p>

<p>人是誰都看不上眼的。</p>
<p>第四，社會上的矛盾現象使教師的信仰完全失却。兒童在教師那裏聽了一篇篇的大道理，再看看社會上客觀的環境，却有許多塲合與教師的話大相逕庭。兒童對於教師的信仰，起先不能不起動盪，終於有所懷疑了。比方說迷信無補於救國之道，這是兒童已常聞之於教　　四中，兒童也確信其有至理。但是落在他們眼前的事實，竟有人提倡念經　域，而且教師還督促他們去參加這種運動。對於教師言行的矛盾，他們的小心靈中自不能不起反感。至於教師怕摔破了飯碗，要迎合上司的心理，才教他們這麽幹的，這可他們不知道，就是知道，也不能相諒的。</p>
<p>綜合上述種種原因，要使教師地位不降落，實是萬不可能的！兒童是未來國家的柱石，使這個柱石穏固的責任是教師，教師旣負有重大的責任，自不應受人家鄙視，這已成爲了一種天經地義。至於教師自己方面的修養也是緊要的。教師是兒童理想的對象，教師的一舉一動，在在可以影響兒童的行爲。教師的言行應當一致，口裏說到那樣，就應做到那樣，這樣才可得到兒童的信仰，而使教授上感到方便，而且也只有這樣，教育事業纔能有展放曙光的希望。</p>

<p>兄弟倆商量着，做了一隻大紙袋，這在紙店裏是極便當的。把那袋拿到庭中央，在其下面燃起乾草。</p>
<p>兄弟倆快活得出聲而笑，紙袋裏充滿了烟，便離開兄弟倆的手而上昇了。他倆仰起頭坐着，拍手鼓舞。自己的設計得到成功，歡喜自非無理的。但那個時候，袋並非因充滿烟而上昇，實因靠着空氣加熱變輕而被帶着上昇的。</p>
<p>接着蒙脫哥費兄弟再製作了第二個大氣球，膨脹成圓形，直徑有三十呎。</p>
<p>一七八三年六月五日這氣球預備在阿諾奈廣塲舉放。聞訊齊集者數千人。蒙脫哥費的氣球向着澄淸的空間靜靜上昇。觀者齊聲喝采，兄弟之得意可知。結果，在當時無疑的得到非常成功。氣球昇高一哩半，其中空氣漸漸冷却後便靜靜下降。</p>
<p>蒙脫哥費當時的氣球，當然還不能載貨乘人。</p>
<p>兄弟之成功，與人人以極大的刺激，製造氣球的人驟多。那年八月，有名的科學者愛姆，却而司與洛勃脫兄弟作一氣球，氣球的外皮用塗橡膠的薄綢做成，其中裝以輕氣。（未完）</p>

Through-traffic between Peiping and Shenyang can be realized by July 1st. However, with the shortening of the line, many railway staff have been laid off, making temporary borrowing this time particularly difficult.

In terms of staffing, the railway bureau... Regarding negotiations in the war zone, he has met with Shibayama several times, and progress can be made after the through-traffic is implemented.

<p>(Peiping) Two new train sets manufactured by the Tangshan Railway Factory of the Northern Peiping Railway were released from the factory today and are undergoing test runs between Tangshan and Luanxian.

Currently, the Peiping and other local branches are selling through-transportation tickets. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) During a meeting with Japanese personnel in Dalian, Yin Tong requested that after the train operations begin, everything must be handled in accordance with Chinese law. Initially, the Japanese side strongly argued against this, but after both sides made every effort to negotiate, the Japanese side finally agreed to concede. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, after returning to Tianjin, Yin Tong immediately convened a meeting of important department heads and section chiefs at the Railway Bureau to secretly instruct them on all preparations before the through-traffic.

Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming are scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow to earnestly discuss and resolve matters with Shibayama and others. It is reported that there are about five issues on the agenda: (1) The number of New Peacekeeping Force troops to be dispatched will be standardized at 6,000 men. A certain amount of light weapons may be carried at discretion. The dispatch period can be determined after negotiations are settled in Tianjin. (2) To crack down on Japanese and Korean ruffians selling drugs in the war zone, it is proposed to request that the Japanese side order local garrison commanders not to protect them any further and to assist in the investigation and prohibition. (3) To take over Malanyu and safeguard the Eastern Tombs, except for the administrative part of Malanyu, which has already been taken over, it is hoped that the Japanese puppet troops will withdraw outside the pass within a short period of time. (4) The puppet police in Nantianmen should quickly withdraw from Gubeikou to outside the Great Wall line as agreed. (5) The Japanese puppet troops in Xifengkou, Saheqiao, and Lengkou Jianchangying should be moved outside the Great Wall line.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Passed Through Jinan Yesterday; Han Fuju and Others Greeted Him at the Station</h3>

Han urged Kong to get off the train, but Kong said that he had to rush to Peiping on the 25th and would return north on the original train at 5:00 PM. In the train, he told Yu Gu that Shandong's politics were excellent, but local products were declining tragically. Although the central government has repeatedly reduced taxes, exports last year were still 6.5% lower than the previous year. This is because the goods have not been improved, and it is hoped that the authorities will assist the business community in seeking improvement as soon as possible. Furthermore, there is a lot of smuggling along the coast, causing great losses to customs. Setting up checkpoints and investigating smuggling has already collected taxes, as has the Changcheng Pass. This is not about setting up customs to collect taxes. There have been three robberies of 10,000 dan of salt in Weihaiwei. Fortunately, the provincial government and the navy have made every effort to maintain peace and have been pacified. The government should be considerate of the people, but those who disregard the law should also be dealt with according to the law. In addition to inspecting Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi, if there is time on this trip, he plans to go to Suiyuan and Shaanxi and then come to Xuzhou in the north for inspection. It will take about four weeks to return to Nanjing after Jinan and Qingdao. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Triangular Conflict of Naval Arms Reduction</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The preliminary talks for the naval arms reduction conference attended by Great Britain, the United States, and Japan have begun in London. What will be the final outcome? By carefully observing the unofficial opinions expressed by these three countries, we can get a glimpse of the general situation. Let us first discuss Great Britain. In principle, it wants to do its best to maintain the status quo of the world. However, it absolutely does not want the excessive growth of French power on the European continent. The struggle between France and Italy for dominance in the Mediterranean is becoming increasingly blatant. Although Great Britain has not taken sides, its psychology of using the conflict between France and Italy to maintain its special navigation rights in the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal cannot be concealed. As for the relationship between Great Britain and Germany, it is clearly different from before the war. Although Germany today is not without long-term plans, its strength is limited. Opposing the Soviet Union is just empty talk. Its original intention is to figure out how to get rid of the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. The desires of the Germans have long been understood by Great Britain, so it does not hesitate to show favor to Germany in order to suppress France. In the Far East, Great Britain does not want the expansion of American economic power, and even more does not want the Soviet Union to come out to the east. Therefore, it provides Japan with convenience everywhere. It does not know that this strategy has actually helped Japan achieve a situation of dominating East Asia, and even threatens India. Great Britain cannot unite with the United States to contain Japan, nor is it willing to be in a position of failure, so it plans to add cruisers and other auxiliary vessels to consolidate its vested interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>Japan believes that the discussion of naval technical issues, such as the reduction of battleships, the limitation of heavy cruisers, and the abolition of aircraft carriers, are all errors of the Washington and London conferences. From Japan's perspective, raising these kinds of issues will cause Great Britain and the United States to coordinate and fall into a state of isolation. Therefore, it changed its strategy and proposed its vaunted principle of military equality, and clearly stated that Japan has no intention of invading the West at this moment. As for the market issues of India and British directly administered colonies, it is also willing to gradually consult with Great Britain to ease the hostility of the trade war between the two countries. Japan's goal is nothing more than to slowly implement its continental policy, destroying British and American cooperation on the one hand, and facilitating its dominance in the Western Pacific on the other.</p>
<p>The United States' attempt to open up markets is not as aggressive as it used to be. The Washington authorities are deeply afraid of causing disputes again due to naval issues. Therefore, it proposes to extend the London Naval Treaty to prove that it has no aggressive intentions towards foreign countries. Even if European countries do not repay war debts, the United States has not yet made any positive statements except to propose passive countermeasures. This is enough to show that the American mentality is determined to eliminate the domestic economic panic as the top priority. Because of the existence of this psychology, it only declares the maintenance of the open-door policy toward China. It is even abandoning special interests in the Philippines and allowing it to become independent. However, whether the independence of the Philippines can match its name in reality and not be threatened by Japanese hegemony is still questionable. The Philippines has a lot of room for development and is only separated from Tainan by a narrow strip of water. The Japanese will inevitably bring their political immigration policy and economic dumping policy with them. Filipinos will have no way to protect themselves. Although there are rumors that the United States has asked Great Britain to jointly guarantee the neutrality of the Philippines, it is difficult to expect success due to Great Britain's own contradictions. It is expected that the result of the 1935 naval arms reduction conference will only make the conflict between the three countries more and more acute.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji Returned to Xi'an Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Zhang Ji went to the Zhongnan Mountains south of the city on the 9th to inspect the highway built by the Western Capital Planning Committee. He did not return to the city until last night. He stayed in the countryside for more than ten days. According to him, the highway south of the city has been completed. The scenery in Zhongnan Mountain, Cuihua Mountain, and Tangyu is excellent, making people forget to return. Cuihua Mountain has Jiangtang, ice caves, and waterfalls. The ice caves are frozen all year round. Tangyu has natural hot springs. They were all the most prosperous areas in the Tang Dynasty and have been abandoned. It is now planned to repair them and make them the best scenery in the Western Capital in the future. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>

(3) The dredging project from Hukou to the Yangtze River should be carried out as soon as possible.

<h3>Lloyd George Admonishes the British People Not to Forget Their Important Mission, Establishing Policies to Regain War Opportunities, and His Aspirations Should Extend to Asia</h3>
<p>(London) Today, former British Prime Minister Lloyd George, with fiery enthusiasm, published an open letter in the "Viewpoint Report," calling on the British nation not to forget its privileged position in history, but to think about how to fulfill its traditional mission in the international political arena. George stated that the British people seem to have forgotten their previous lofty ideals recently, but with a major disaster looming in Europe today, if we want to turn misfortune into good fortune, the British people must restore their previous strong and fair policies. Since America's hands and feet are bound by its internal disputes, England must rebuild its historical mission today and establish a firm, clear, and easy-to-understand European policy, so that the imminent war can be avoided. George also stated that France has never understood the non-partisan and detached attitude of Britain, and it has sometimes been misunderstood as a contempt for Anglo-French friendship. However, "We joined the European war previously not because of our pro-French sentiment, nor because we were anti-German. Our declaration of war on Germany was only because the balance of power in the world had been harmed by the German-French in 1914, just as the balance of power in Europe was harmed by France in the 18th and 19th centuries. We must follow the mission given to us by history. We have repeatedly saved the freedom of Europe in the past, but today our ambition cannot be limited to Europe alone, but should extend our compassionate attitude to Asia. Isolation is a serious step that humiliates our dignified history." George went on to point out two major mistakes in recent British policy: (1) All signatories to the Treaty of Versailles, whether German or French, should abide by their obligations, especially the reduction of armaments. This article was overlooked. (2) The attitude towards Japan is weak and painful, so that the prestige of the League of Nations has been plunged into eternal ruin. George also stated that on the day a new war breaks out in the future, British intervention can predetermine the fate of the war. Whoever Britain is with will win the final victory. Previously, British politicians did not know how to use this fact, so that Britain's prestige in the international political arena has been reduced to the lowest limit today. George concluded by saying that in today's world, the importance of politicians such as Litvinov, Mussolini, Hitler, and even Barthou has far exceeded that of the past, but the cards in each person's hands cannot be compared with those held by Britain.

<h3>US-Japan Aircraft Formation: Competing in Long-Distance Flights; One to Alaska, One to Wake Island; Soviet Russia Accumulates Provisions, Preparing for Events in the Far East</h3>
<p>(Washington) The War Department announced today that the Air Force will conduct a flight from Washington to Alaska in early July to demonstrate its strength, dispelling external rumors that it is too weak to handle airmail services. The War Department stated that ten giant Martin-type bombers, crewed by twenty Air Force officers and ten enlisted men, will fly to the northernmost territory of the United States. The flight commander is Major Arnold. The exact date of the formation flight has not yet been determined. The War Department noted that the ten giant bombers participating in the early July flight will take off from Bolling Field here, first landing in Minneapolis, then flying across the Canadian border from Minnesota, stopping in Lequin. Subsequent stops include Edmonton, Prince George, Whitehorse, Fairbanks, and Nome. The War Department stated that the purpose of this flight is for training and photography. However, well-informed sources claim that the purpose of this large-scale flight is to wash away the shame of the Air Force's inability to handle airmail services after the government canceled airmail contracts. Since the Air Force took over airmail services, a total of twelve pilots have died in accidents in a short period, with many more seriously injured. There were even days with as many as four pilot fatalities. As a result, national airmail services had to be temporarily suspended for forty-eight hours. Congress has been particularly critical of the Air Force's accidents. It is understood that another purpose of this flight is to visit various cities in Canada to demonstrate the friendship between the two countries. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As the Japanese navy enhances its fleet, the air corps must also be enhanced. Therefore, efforts are underway to train a formation flight of five or six Type 91 monoplanes from Oppama to Sapan Island in the South Seas, a non-stop long-distance flight of 1,300 nautical miles, from the end of July to August. This action was stimulated by the US Air Force’s formation flight held in January of this year and its planned flight for this summer. (Dentsu Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Naval Ministry sources, six light bombers belonging to the Yokosuka Naval Air Corps are scheduled to fly to Sapan Island, one of the Japanese mandated islands in the South Seas, in early July, a distance of 1,300 kilometers. The success of this long-distance flight exercise is closely related to the operations of Japanese naval aircraft in the South Pacific. All sectors in Japan are paying close attention to its results. (Hualian Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to another Naval Ministry source, the Japanese Navy is scheduled to hold a large-scale submarine maneuver in the South Seas mandated islands from late July to late August to test the value of the islands in naval warfare. Furthermore, the six naval aircraft that will fly to Sapan Island beforehand will also participate in the exercise. (Hualian Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The People's Committee decided today to actively procure a large number of agricultural machines to harvest Soviet Russia's grain. The Committee ordered the Heavy Industry Committee to take responsibility for procuring the machines and stated firmly that these machines should be delivered on time to support agricultural activities. The Committee's order confirms the predictions previously published by the Associated Press that Soviet Russia's wheat crop may have an astonishingly large harvest this year. The purpose is not only to prepare for war in the Far East but also to engage in dumping on the international market. The order stipulates that Soviet factories should produce 6,475 various machines, 4,000 automatic grain binders, 500 horsepower grain binders, and 7,150 threshing machines of three types by July 15.

<h3>Disagreement over Japan's Request to Change Naval Ratio; Great Britain and the United States are Largely in Agreement; US Diplomatic Circles Strongly Urge British Naval Leaders to Suggest Extending the Existing Treaty to Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to several observers here today, US diplomatic circles are currently strongly urging British naval leaders to suggest extending the existing treaty and maintaining the original 5:5:3 naval ratio. The US Congressional approval of the strongest navy bill and Great Britain's request to build more cruisers and auxiliary ships both have the power to make Japan accept the existing ratio and no longer demand increases. However, the observers believe that this kind of diplomatic effort may not have any effect. Japan is willing to compromise on all other points, but it insists on naval equality, believing that it is related to Japan's face and national defense. While Great Britain and the United States have many differences of opinion regarding the 1925 naval conference, they both believe that Japan's demand for equality cannot be allowed.

<h3>Anglo-American Negotiations Temporarily Suspended; Awaiting US Response to British Request</h3>
<p>(London) According to Tokyo news today, Japanese newspapers claim that if Japan does not obtain a modification of the 5:5:3 ratio in next year's naval conference, Japan will announce the abolition of the London Naval Treaty and the Washington Naval Treaty and then independently pursue its naval program for national defense purposes. British and American naval circles are deeply worried upon hearing this threat. It is heard that Japan now opposes the suspension of the naval conference. It is also heard that Foreign Minister Hirota has told the Cabinet that Japan will oppose holding the naval conference in Geneva. It is heard that Japan's opposition to the Soviet Union's participation in the naval conference is not as strong as before. Japan is particularly willing to discuss the issue of Russia, Germany, and Spain attending the conference from a European perspective. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent in London learned today that if Japan raises its demand for naval equality in the current preliminary naval negotiations, the United States may indicate that this would make any naval conference difficult to hold. At the same time, the preliminary naval negotiations between the British and American delegations have been temporarily suspended, awaiting Washington's response to Great Britain's recent request. It is heard that Great Britain's request includes building a large number of small cruisers and aircraft. American experts are currently studying this request and successively reporting the results to Washington. The US Naval Department can probably review the matter and prepare a response next week. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The US side, at the Anglo-American experts' meeting held in London in preparation for disarmament negotiations, proposed increasing the total tonnage and seeking a total of seventy cruisers, and also had to build a large number of destroyers and new aircraft carriers, which surprised the United States, and Prime Minister MacDonald of Great Britain was in temporary need of travel and rest due to eye disease, so the future of the meeting was already bleak, and the Japanese naval authorities' observations on the future of the meeting and the Anglo-American attitude are as follows: This is an Anglo-American diplomatic battle, and it is difficult to judge future developments without carefully observing future expressions. However, the fact that the meeting has already hit the initial snag is a fact. The UK Navy's request this time is a return to the tough stance around the Geneva Tripartite Conference in 1927, so if this is a genuine claim, the Anglo-American consultation will inevitably lead to a breakdown, and if either the UK or the US does not give way, next year's disarmament conference will of course break down. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(New York) According to a Washington dispatch from the New York Times today, Davis, the US representative participating in the Anglo-American naval talks, has notified the State Department that Great Britain is now proposing to build a larger navy. Secretary of State Hull stated that the discussion of this proposal is only exploratory. The dispatch also stated that the State Department is quite surprised that Great Britain made this proposal so quickly in the early stages of the talks, as the State Department initially believed that there would be no substantial developments from London for several weeks or months. There is now an impression of disappointment here, fearing that Great Britain's demand for a larger navy will encourage Japan to demand an expansion of its fleet. If it is said that Great Britain's move may make Japan aware of the price of demanding equality and dare not easily demand equality, then the opposite may be true. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Second Meeting between US and Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Japanese Ambassador to Great Britain Matsudaira visited Davis, the chief US representative to the naval conference preparatory talks, this morning to discuss the issues that the US and Japan will raise in the upcoming naval talks.

<p>(Washington) According to generally well-informed sources, Japan seems likely to demand the most broadly defined right to naval equality. In other words, Japan intends to make its naval power surpass the navies of all other countries in the Pacific. This point alone may be enough to cause the naval conference to stall.

<h3>Japan Wants to Divide the World into Three Spheres of Influence; Italian Newspaper Opposes</h3>
<p>Foreign newspapers in Rome have reported that Japan seems to have suggested to Great Britain and the United States that the world's oceans be divided into three spheres of influence, with each country having the right and obligation to maintain world peace within its sphere of influence. This news is considered credible here. The "Labor Newspaper" of the Pan-Nationalist Party strongly opposes Japan's request. It stated, "Based on what treaty does Japan want to divide a sphere of influence in the world and assume responsibility for maintaining peace? Japan's intention is to conclude treaties to divide Great Britain and the United States in order to prevent the two countries from reaching an agreement. If Great Britain and the United States could have reached an agreement between 1931 and 1932, then 'Manchukuo' could not have been established. In short, Japan's priority is to continue developing safely towards the Asian continent." The Labor Newspaper also stated that Italy cannot recognize the division of countries into ocean nations and Mediterranean nations. Italy builds ships for navigation on all seven oceans of the world and cannot limit its activities to the Mediterranean alone. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Build a Large Airfield in Fukuoka; Director of Aviation Bureau Kataoka Completes Survey, Considers it a Key Point for the South Seas and China Routes</h3>
<p>Osaka According to the Tobo News, Kataoka Naomichi, Director of the Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, surveyed the new airfield near Fukuoka City from the 14th to the 21st of this month. After completing the survey, he went to southern Kyushu. According to Kataoka, Fukuoka has major military industry centers such as the Yawata Steel Works, so Fukuoka must have a fully equipped airfield to defend key points and Fukuoka City. In terms of air traffic, Fukuoka will be a key point for aviation to Korea, Taiwan, the South Seas, and the Chinese mainland. Its importance will gradually increase. The Ministry of Communications wants to consult with the Ministry of the Army and sacrifice everything to build an excellent airfield as soon as possible. (Hualian Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Kuroda Case Report Nearing Completion; Japanese Cabinet Likely to Collapse; Responsibility Division Theory Creates Major Political Impact</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The current cabinet's future, the fate of which depends on the review of Justice Minister Oyama's investigation report on the Kuroda case, will be determined by the three elders of the government: Prime Minister Saito, Home Minister Yamamoto, and Finance Minister Takahashi. However, summing up the various reports on the political upheaval, it is said that if the content of the incident reported by Justice Minister Oyama is not only related to the Ministry of Finance, but is also extensive and profound, then the entire cabinet will inevitably resign en masse. It is absolutely impossible to use the responsibility division theory to resolve the matter by only having the Finance Minister resign. Even within the government department, apart from the elders, some cabinet members are also advocating joint resignation from a purely theoretical perspective. Even if the Justice Minister's report advocates the responsibility division theory, the theory of joint resignation is still quite powerful in the general trend. Therefore, the hope for the leadership's life-saving strategy is slim. Justice Minister Oyama's report is scheduled to be submitted on the 25th or 26th, and the atmosphere of a political upheaval will be quite strong at that time. (Dentsu Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The intentions of the influential figures in the House of Peers regarding the responsibility division theory of Finance Minister Takahashi are generally as follows: Finance Minister Takahashi's reason for advocating the responsibility division theory of the Ministry of Finance incident is to avoid involving other cabinet members and to minimize the impact on the political situation. However, if the malfeasance incident of the suspects in the Ministry of Finance incident is clear, then the current cabinet, which touts rectifying discipline, should quickly express its future. (Dentsu Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At a time when the current cabinet is standing at the crossroads of continuing or collapsing, Finance Minister Takahashi, whose future is most noteworthy, suddenly issued the responsibility division theory, which has had a great impact on various aspects of the political world. Secretary-General Aso of the Minseito Party told reporters about this matter, saying that the current cabinet should be responsible for the Ministry of Finance incident. Although Finance Minister Takahashi has issued the theory that the responsibility of the Finance Minister for supervision and the responsibility of the Prime Minister can be divided, the current cabinet, which is organized to promote the clearing of discipline, has actually brewed this action of disrupting discipline itself and cannot be at peace.

<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, Army Minister Hayashi questioned Justice Minister Oyama, urging Justice Minister Oyama to quickly conclude the Zaibu corruption case. It is said that this was prompted by the Araki faction of the military. It is said that the upper echelons of the Japanese political world are doing their best to avoid a political upheaval because General Ugaki, the most powerful candidate for Prime Minister, has fled back to Keijo after being attacked by the hard-line factions of the army and navy. Baron Hiranuma, who was nominated by the Araki faction, was also attacked by the combined forces of senior statesmen, zaibatsu, and political parties and cannot take office. The other candidates all have their own strengths and weaknesses, making it very difficult to realize. Therefore, they strongly advocate the theory of individual responsibility for the Minister of Finance to avoid a political upheaval. If a political upheaval is unavoidable, then Saito will be pushed up again to avoid major domestic turmoil. It is said that the Fascist faction is threatening Justice Minister Oyama to thoroughly investigate the matter, even to the point of arresting former Education Minister Hatoyama. Their purpose is very clear: to undermine party politics. The inner workings of the political world are very gloomy. (Hualian Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Accepts British Proposal; To Resolve Debt Problems; Will Send Representatives to Great Britain to Open Negotiations</h3>

<h3>Anglo-German Dispatches Exchanged; London Publishes White Paper</h3>
<p>(London) The documents exchanged between Great Britain and Germany regarding German foreign debt were published as a White Paper today. The wording of the British dispatch is extremely candid, and its sharp tone has raised speculation in business circles about whether this dispatch can promote understanding between the two countries. The financial and political circles do not view the future favorably. When the British dispatch was delivered to Berlin but not yet published, Schacht, the President of the German National Bank, had already issued passionate remarks yesterday.</p>
<p>According to a Berlin telegram, the German National Bank has announced new regulations governing foreign exchange, stipulating that (1) the amount of foreign exchange released each day in the future shall not exceed the amount received, (2) the distribution of demand in various countries shall not be consistent, and priority must be given to the needs of raw materials and food, and (3) all payments of foreign debt must first be submitted to the National Bank for approval (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, the government released a white paper, which includes (1) the German government's note to Great Britain after the German central bank decided to suspend payment of foreign debt principal and interest, and (2) Great Britain's reply to the German government on this matter, which was delivered by the British ambassador to Germany yesterday. The main points of the white paper are that Great Britain invited Germany to send representatives to consult with the British government on Germany's long-term and medium-term debts, government bonds, and the entire issue of debt remittance. The German note of June 15 stated that Germany has no intention of denying its debts. However, because the amount of Germany's foreign debt is too large, Germany must have a surplus in foreign trade in order to repay the principal and interest on its foreign debt. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to reduce the quantity of imports in order to save money to pay for imports that cannot be avoided and to continue remitting foreign debt to the extent possible. The German note finally stated that Germany hopes that various countries will not take retaliatory measures against German exports, which would make Germany's difficult situation even more serious. Foreign Minister Simon's reply stated that British creditors had previously recognized temporary concessions to Germany so that Germany could overcome its difficulties. Various concessions are also being prepared for commercial debts, provided that Germany respects the Dawes and Young loans. Since the interest on the two loans accounts for only 2% of Germany's total income, there is no reason for Germany to refuse to pay. From 1933 to 1934, Anglo-German trade actually benefited Germany, and the amount of money that Germany made from this surplus exceeded three times the interest that Germany had to pay on all bonds issued in London. The reply also stated that the British government has decided to request the necessary powers from Parliament to protect British commercial and financial interests. However, if a compromise can be reached to avoid taking offset measures, Great Britain is still willing to negotiate. Therefore, it hopes that the German government will quickly send representatives to London to conduct negotiations. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if Germany does not pay the principal and interest on the Dawes and Young loans, the French government has decided to take offset measures, that is, to convert the surplus of German trade with France into marks and list it under the German government's deposit account. However, because the principal and interest for the previous period were paid on June 15, and there are no arrears from now until July 15, the above offset measures will not be implemented by the French government until July 15, when France and Germany cannot reach an agreement.

<h3>Great Britain Boycotts Japanese Goods; Rejects Japanese Request</h3>

Therefore, on the 21st, Ambassador Matsudaira and Commercial Attaché Matsuyama visited Secretary of State for Trade Hore-Belisha and demanded a reply to the Japanese protest. After stating Great Britain's attitude, Secretary of State for Trade Hore-Belisha replied that Japan's request could not be fully recognized. Therefore, the ratio system for dealing with Japanese goods will continue to be implemented in British colonies in the future. Ambassador Matsudaira and Commercial Attaché Matsuyama will continue to negotiate strongly with Secretary of State for Trade Hore-Belisha to urge him to reconsider. (Dentsu Telegram, 23rd)</p>

Playwright Mrs. Dawson and poet Walter were elected as permanent members of the Executive Committee. Representatives from Austria, France, England, America, Catalonia, Czechoslovakia, India, and Scotland are all on the Executive Committee. The assembly unanimously voted to hold next year's congress in Catalonia. During today's meeting, representatives from various European countries engaged in heated debates. Initially, Italian author Manitti and the representative from Czechoslovakia, Bilar, clashed. The verbal battle intensified after Bilar made sarcastic remarks. Subsequently, German author Toller proposed a resolution protesting to the German government against the imprisonment of German authors and the burning of their works. Swiss representative Meyer immediately criticized Toller, stating that Toller himself had once harassed authors and journalists. Toller then called Meyer a liar, causing a great uproar in the assembly. Order was eventually restored, and the resolution was passed. German playwright and author Ludwig proposed a resolution stipulating the procedures for convening PEN Club congresses, so that writers worldwide could take joint action in times of war or the threat of war. Wells opposed this proposal, saying that if it were passed, he would resign, believing that such views were merely empty talk and could not be effective, therefore it should not be put to a vote.

<h3>Handling Marital Disputes in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>▲ Nanchang Headquarters Formulates Eight Measures</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Red Bandits have always advocated breaking down the patriarchal society and promoting communal wives and communal property. In the areas they occupy, rites, customs, and laws are completely destroyed. The relations between men and women are especially chaotic, with absolute freedom of marriage and divorce. The poison has spread so widely that it has almost become promiscuity. Now, as the bandit areas are gradually recovered, refugees return in droves. Some wives have been taken by others, some have been forced to divorce by the bandits and now urgently seek reconciliation, or some couples, due to uncertainty about each other's survival, have temporarily formed relationships with others and now wish to reunite. Even those who were previously drafted by the bandits into laundry and comfort teams, or who were forcibly married by the bandits and have escaped, are numerous. Therefore, there are many disputes arising from marriage and divorce among men and women in the recovered areas. The Headquarters has now specially formulated eight measures for handling marriage in the recovered areas, and issued a general order to the provincial governments, high courts, and senior military officers in the provinces and regions suppressing bandits in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan to comply. The order states: "Upon investigation, in the provinces within the bandit areas, in places occupied by the bandits, all rites, customs, and laws have been completely destroyed, and the relations between men and women are especially chaotic. They advocated the heresy of communal wives and lived a life of bestiality, so there is no such thing as a marriage system. Now that the army is advancing and suppressing the bandits, and the bandit areas are gradually being cleared, marital disputes will inevitably arise. However, the matters are complex and cannot be handled fairly solely based on ordinary laws. It is necessary to adapt to these special circumstances and formulate separate relief measures in order to maintain ethics and correct customs. Therefore, special measures for handling marriage in the recovered bandit areas are formulated, promulgated and implemented. In addition to separate orders, the handling measures are hereby issued, ordering the 'Provincial Government, High Court, and General Headquarters to comply accordingly, and to instruct their subordinates to be informed accordingly.' This order."</p>
<p>Measures for Handling Marriage in Recovered Bandit Areas: Article 1: These measures shall apply to the resolution of marital relationships in the bandit areas after recovery. Article 2: In these measures, "marital relationship" refers to a man and a woman having the intention of permanent common life and cohabiting. "Bandit area" refers to an area that has been occupied by Red Bandits. Article 3: If one or both parties of a married couple have been taken away by the bandits or have fallen into the bandit area and remarried, it shall not be considered bigamy or adultery. The validity of the marriage shall be as follows: 1. If both parties of the couple are willing to restore the original marriage after the recovery of the bandit area, the previous marriage shall be maintained and the subsequent marriage shall be dissolved, but it must be requested within one year. 2. If both parties of the couple are unwilling to restore the original marriage after the recovery of the bandit area, the previous marriage shall be deemed divorced. 3. If the husband or wife is willing to restore the original marriage after the recovery of the bandit area, but the other party is unwilling, the subsequent marriage shall be maintained, but the former husband may request compensation of up to 100 yuan from the latter husband. 4. In the case of the preceding paragraph, the former husband may demand compensation of up to 100 yuan from the latter husband, and the former wife may demand reasonable alimony from the original husband, but this shall not apply if the former wife has remarried or has been remarried. Article 4: Those who have been married more than twice in the bandit area may not request the restoration of intermediate marriages or compensation. Article 5: If one of the married couple does not return or there is no news for more than one year after the recovery of the bandit area without a legitimate reason, the other party may remarry. Article 6: Child support shall be borne by the father born in the marital relationship, but special agreements shall be followed if there are special agreements. Article 7: Matters not stipulated in these measures shall be governed by the Civil Code and its implementation law. Article 8: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

Since it was occupied by the Fang Shao Communist bandits in the 17th year of the Republic of China as a base, it has been occupied for six years. This time, after being painfully suppressed and recovered by the National Army, the surviving people, who had been groaning under the poison of the sunken haze for a long time, were finally able to see the light of day again. According to a visitor from Hekou, the bandit nest in the county was broken by Commander Liang and completely recovered. The political training office of the division and the local authorities are currently preparing for post-disaster relief and striving to appease the people. The people in the bandit area and the refugees who fled to neighboring counties have returned one after another. However, the county area, which has been devastated for a long time, has destroyed farms and no houses remain. The victims are exposed to the wind and eat in the open air, and the situation is extremely tragic. The garrison has ordered the battalions and companies to build dozens of houses as a place for the returning people to live in. Now, the houses in the county seat are connected to each other, and the city is gradually returning to its former appearance. The market is thriving, and due to the increasing number of returning people, department stores and restaurants have reopened one after another. Postal and transportation services have also been restored. The 50-li highway from Hekou Dawangdu to the county seat has been completed by the Zhao and Wang Lv regiments. The highway from Shangrao to Hengcheng will also be open to traffic within the next few days. (19th)</p>
<h3>T.V. Soong's Report on His Inspection of the Northwest</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council held its ninth standing committee meeting on the morning of the 22nd. Committee member T.V. Soong reported on his inspection of the Northwest. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The main purpose of my trip to the Northwest was to inspect the various construction projects undertaken by the Council in the Northwest. Today, I will first give a summary oral report for discussion. As for my overall impressions of the Northwest inspection, I will submit a detailed written report later.</p>
<p>(1) Water Conservancy: The Council's Focus. The Northwest has suffered from droughts and famines for many years, so we emphasize water conservancy construction. In Shaanxi, the Jinghui and Luohui canals in the cotton-producing areas are particularly important. Therefore, we are actively planning and rushing to build these two canals. The Jinghui Canal was originally a joint project between the China International Famine Relief Commission and the provincial government, costing 1.4 million yuan. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), it irrigated over 3,000 hectares of land. It urgently needs improvement to achieve its full potential. Therefore, it is proposed that the Council provide 250,000 yuan as a revolving fund for repairs and improvements. It is expected to be completed this winter and can irrigate over 5,000 hectares of land.</p>
<p>Regarding the Jinghui Canal, after my inspection, I have the following opinions: (1) The canal was built hastily, focusing on work relief. Therefore, all engineering plans were not well-developed, especially the management methods were poor, and the use of water from small branch canals was left to the farmers' discretion, resulting in water wastage and flooding of roads. (2) After the major disaster in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the people's strength had not recovered, and the income from water levies was very small, resulting in a lack of funds for canal maintenance. In the future, management should be improved, and water levies should be collected conscientiously. The income can not only be used to maintain the canal but also to promote the construction of other water conservancy projects. I believe that this is not a local problem because the price of farmland has increased several times after the canal was built (from 5 yuan per mu before to over 30 yuan per mu now). It is fair to collect water levies for maintenance and to promote other water conservancy projects. If it can be handled properly and set a model, the obvious success will easily attract the attention of domestic and foreign merchants to invest in other water conservancy projects. The government's financial resources are limited. If we can encourage commercial investment, then the huge water conservancy problem in the Northwest will have a concrete solution. However, the Executive Yuan has an order that the collection of water levies per mu cannot exceed the canal's own repair costs. I believe that we should urgently request the Executive Yuan to amend it. The current regulations stipulate that the use of water levies, in addition to canal maintenance, can be used for the development of other water conservancy projects. This method is easy to implement because the people in the Northwest who benefit from water conservancy are willing to pay. Although the situation in Shaanxi is slightly different after the disaster, it can be easily handled with two years of good harvests if the fees are kept light. The Luohui Canal plan was originally planned by the provincial government to divert water from the Luo River for irrigation. Its irrigation area is also an important cotton-producing area. After irrigation, its productivity will be the same as the Jinghui area. It has now started construction and will be completed in two years, irrigating 5,000 hectares of land. The original budget was over 1.4 million yuan. The Council plans to invest 750,000 yuan this year as a revolving fund, and the provincial government will allocate 20,000 yuan per month until completion. The remaining tens of thousands of yuan will be allocated by the Council next year. The Council and the provincial government will jointly establish a water conservancy committee and a water conservancy engineering bureau to be responsible for handling the Jinghui and Luohui canal projects.</p>
<p>Wei River Diversion Plan. There are many water conservancy plans in Shaanxi Province, the most noteworthy is the Wei River Diversion Plan. (1) The Baoji Plan, proposed by German engineer Mr. Barke, roughly involves accumulating water in the Baoji Valley to generate electricity. The electricity will then be used to pump water from the Wei River to irrigate approximately nine million mu of highland fields on the north bank (according to other engineers, only two to three million mu). The remaining electricity will be supplied to various industries and the future Lanzhou-Xinjiang section of the Longhai Railway for train power. In my opinion, the cost is as high as 85 million yuan, which is not currently affordable. The supply of electricity still depends on the development of industry and railways. For the time being, we can only focus on irrigating fields. The cost of irrigation per mu is 17 yuan or even more than 30 yuan. Compared with the current water conservancy plans in the Northwest provinces, the average cost per mu is only about one to two yuan, which is not worthwhile. Therefore, the Barke plan only has value for reconsideration after the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is open to traffic. (2) Committee Chairman Li Yizhi and others have another plan for diverting the Wei River, with a budget of 2 million yuan to irrigate over one million mu. This plan is worthy of study in terms of the country's current economic capacity.</p>
<p>Suiyuan Minsheng Canal. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the China International Famine Relief Commission and the provincial government jointly built the canal to relieve the drought. The total cost was over 860,000 yuan, and it was expected to irrigate about one million mu of land. Because the emphasis was on urgent relief at that time, no detailed surveys were conducted, resulting in the canal bed slope being too flat, the flow being slow and prone to siltation, and many places being washed away by floods. It is now completely abandoned. After the Council sent personnel to survey it, it was considered that it could be partially repaired. Detailed surveys are currently underway. Whether or not it can be started depends on the results of the survey. This canal project budget was resolved by the Council, allocating a revolving fund of 300,000 yuan. If the remedial measures are determined, it can irrigate six to seven thousand hectares of land.</p>
<p>The Council's water conservancy plan was originally limited to the Jinghui and Luohui canals. However, after inspecting the actual situation in Gansu this time, it was found that it has frequently encountered water and drought disasters, and the people are extremely poor. This is because the mountains are rugged, the climate is dry, and although there are many rivers in the territory, most of them cannot be used, and the ancient canals are also silted up and abandoned. It is recognized that it is necessary to operate them urgently. It has been found that near the Yellow River, once irrigated, the land can be turned into paddy fields. According to engineers, the work is easy and can irrigate over 1.8 million mu. After discussing with Chairman Zhu Shaoliang, if the Council can borrow 500,000 yuan, starting with easy work, it can irrigate 600,000 mu. The farmers are willing to repay one yuan per mu per year and recover this loan within one or two years as a revolving fund, which can be used to repair other canals in rotation. Within four or five years, Gansu Province can increase 2 million mu of fertile land to prevent drought and prepare for famine, with little cost and great success.</p>
<p>Ningxia Water Conservancy. Ningxia's Yellow River water conservancy has long been known as the best in the world. This time, the existing ancient canal projects were inspected and found to be relatively complete, unlike the complete destruction of Shaanxi and Gansu. The Qin Dam, Han Canal, and Tang Canal, projects that are more than a thousand years old, are still preserved. However, after Sun Dianying's war, the people suffered heavy losses. If the government uses relief methods to provide separate assistance, it is better to provide work relief. If 100,000 yuan is used to select important canal projects for repair, it can irrigate more than 100,000 mu of land and can also use the engineering corps of the 15th Army. Completion will be faster and the efficiency will be greater.</p>
<p>This time in Ningxia, the precision of the ancient water conservancy system and the economy of water utilization were amazing and admirable. Therefore, it is speculated that the ancient Qin and Long areas, which were known as rich areas, must have had water conservancy systems equal to Ningxia. The poverty today is due to wars in the past, disregarding the people's livelihood, leading to the abandonment of water conservancy, which has resulted in years of drought and famine. Therefore, it is felt that the most important thing for the country to build the Northwest in the future is security and water conservancy.</p>
<p>Qinghai. Qinghai's water and drought disasters are less than those in Shaanxi and Gansu. There are ancient canals that still exist and can be used occasionally. The province has a small population, mostly nomadic, and water conservancy is not urgently needed.</p>
<p>(2) Roads. In recent years, the northern provinces have built many roads, especially Director Yang Hucheng, Military Commander Ma Bufang, and Chairman Ma Hongkui have worked hard. The Council currently selects and repairs two main trunk roads based on important political and economic relations: 1. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Line, and 2. The Xi'an-Hanzhong Line. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road was originally built by the International Famine Relief Commission with work relief. Later, the Council subsidized 200,000 yuan, and the road was roughly shaped. Due to lack of funds, the work was stopped. Many of the bridges and culverts that have been built have collapsed, and the slope must be reduced further. Before the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is completed, this road is an important trunk road for transportation between the Northwest and the coastal provinces and international transportation between Europe and Asia. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek attaches great importance to this line and has repeatedly sent telegrams urging the work to be carried out in sections. It is planned to complete it with 800,000 yuan. The important projects are as follows: (1) Reduce the slope; (2) The bridge foundation has a load-bearing capacity of 10 tons, and the bridge deck has a load-bearing capacity of 7.5 tons, all based on freight trucks; (3) The geology of the Northwest is mostly viscous red mud. When it rains heavily, the mud is difficult to travel on and cannot be used for transportation. After sunny days, the driving is easy to damage. The fundamental remedy is to pave the entire road with stone. However, except for the Liupan Mountain, there is almost no stone available in the Gansu section. Transporting stone to repair the entire road requires at least 5 million yuan. Currently, we have to choose the most easily damaged sections of the road to barely pave with stone and select five important sections along the road to prepare five or six grader trucks. This type of truck is used on the Zhongshan-Macau Highway in China and has good experience. It is very fast and economical to repair roads after heavy rain. It can repair dozens of miles per day. With this equipment, it is estimated that on average, there will only be one or twenty days a year when it cannot be used for transportation. Under normal circumstances, it takes three days to get from Xi'an to Lanzhou and two and a half days to get from Lanzhou to Xi'an. This will greatly increase the convenience of transportation in the Northwest.</p>
<p>The main route for transporting goods from the Northwest is along the Yellow River through Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Suiyuan to Baotou, connecting with the Ping-Sui Railway. This is the most convenient route for freight transportation. However, the Yellow River can only transport goods downstream, and it can only be used for a few months of the year. Therefore, it is urgent to organize the Lanzhou-Xinjiang transportation line. The Northwest provinces are limited by financial resources and specialized talents, and they are also limited by provincial boundaries. Public buses are not easy to operate. The Council, under the order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and at the request of the Shaanxi and Gansu provincial governments, plans to operate Lanzhou-Xinjiang bus transportation with 400,000 yuan. The purpose is to connect the transportation of important goods from Qinghai and Lanzhou to the Longhai Line and operate according to train schedules to facilitate merchants and travelers.</p>
<p>The Xi'an-Hanzhong Road. The Xi'an-Hanzhong Highway is an important line for economic and national defense. There is an incomplete motor road from Xi'an to Baoji. It is now planned to use this section to connect the main road from Baoji to Hanzhong. The preliminary survey has been completed, and two teams of detailed survey personnel have been sent to determine the route and construction methods within a limited time and to start construction as soon as possible. This road is planned to allocate 350,000 yuan this year. The Council selects these two tasks with its existing strength and focuses on operating them. The assistance of 8,000 to 9,000 military engineers dispatched by Chairman Zhu of Gansu and Director Yang of Shaanxi has greatly benefited the progress of the two roads.</p>
<p>(3) Health. The Northwest is more backward than other provinces in terms of health. In addition to basic health treatment institutions in major cities, there is no equipment in other parts of the province, and the people hardly know what health is. The Council plans to set up health experimental centers in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, and Ningxia, and to set up branches in important cities to lead the improvement and expansion of existing public health treatment institutions in the provinces. For example, the recurrent plague in northern Shaanxi urgently needs to establish a health experimental center for prevention. The goal is to establish a health foundation for the tens of millions of people in the Northwest and to cultivate a strong nation.</p>
<p>Modern medical skills in the Northwest provinces are not well-developed. There are two reasons: (1) The area is poor, and medical talents from other provinces are unwilling to go west to serve; (2) Few children in the Northwest have the opportunity to study medicine in universities in other provinces, and a few people who can afford to study abroad are addicted to the comfort of life in the southeast or abroad and are unwilling to return to their hometowns to serve. Therefore, for the fundamental plan, after discussing with all parties, if the Shanghai Tongji Medical and Engineering Departments can be moved to Xi'an, children in the Northwest can study locally and not be contaminated by the luxury of other provinces. This can establish the foundation of medicine in the Northwest and cultivate the necessary construction talents in engineering. The government already has a large amount of subsidy for Tongji School every month. If it is moved to Xi'an, only the cost of building houses is required. The school is located in Shanghai, where schools are lined up. Its existence has little to do with it. If it can be moved to Xi'an, its benefits to the people of the Northwest are not insignificant.</p>
<p>Veterinary Medicine and Livestock Improvement. Animal husbandry is a major industry in the Northwest, but veterinary institutions can be said to have no equipment. Although there are no accurate statistics on the losses from animal epidemics every year, it is estimated that the loss in the death of cattle and sheep must be more than 10 million yuan. Therefore, the fundamental problem of animal husbandry is prevention. The Council plans to add veterinary experimental specialty courses to the above-mentioned public health institutions in the Northwest provinces and establish a serum manufacturing plant in Lanzhou. However, there are only five or six veterinary experts in the country. In addition to planning to hire domestic experts, it is also planned to hire four or five British and French experts with experience in Africa, Annam, and India to take charge of veterinary affairs in Gansu and Qinghai provinces. It is also planned to establish a veterinary school in Lanzhou, select outstanding soldiers from the army and local children, and strive to popularize it among the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui people. Experts from China and abroad will be professors to make veterinary knowledge and skills universal in the border provinces. The Council's livestock budget was originally set at 400,000 yuan, but after this inspection, it was believed that the initial foundation of animal husbandry should start with prevention. In the next few years, veterinary medicine will be the main focus, and livestock improvement will be the secondary focus. After discussing with experts, in order to concentrate efforts and facilitate progress, it is planned to merge the Northwest health and veterinary expenses. The original livestock 400,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan was transferred to water conservancy to increase funding, and 300,000 yuan was used for veterinary and livestock improvement expenses. Therefore, the Northwest health and veterinary original budget of 300,000 yuan, the public health, veterinary and livestock improvement will be merged, and the cost is about 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Rural Construction. The rural areas of the Northwest provinces are declining and impoverished and urgently need relief. The Council's financial resources are limited, and we can only start with Shaanxi first. Because Shaanxi is an important cotton-producing area, it is especially important to prohibit the planting of opium poppies and switch to planting cotton to offset the income. The Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Council has set up a branch in Shaanxi to strive for improvement. Cooperation in production, transportation, sales, and credit needs to be expanded. The Jing River area uses the Jinghui Canal for irrigation to plant cotton fields. The Shanghai China Communications and other banks and public groups have been promoting cooperation in this area. However, the wheat fields outside the canal, which account for nine-tenths of the province, are not taken care of. After consultation with the provincial government, it is planned that the Council will allocate 200,000 yuan, and the provincial government plans to raise 500,000 yuan in installments. This will be used as a fund, either to release loans or to be used as a guarantee for bank loans. Banks can rely on this to increase the limit for releasing loans, and wheat farmers will benefit greatly. Although the Council spends a small amount of money, if commercial banks can release several times the amount of money because of this guarantee, the result will be more effective than the Council's direct release of loans.</p>
<p>The above sections are the feelings about the work of the Council after this inspection. The Northwest construction fee for this year, the conference originally stipulated in the outline in March. It is now proposed to revise the distribution within the possible scope as left:</p>
<p>Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Jinghui Canal Improvement Expenses 250,000 yuan</p>
<p>Luohui Canal Construction Expenses 750,000 yuan</p>
<p>Minsheng Canal Improvement Expenses 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Gansu Canals Construction Expenses 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Ningxia Canals Construction Expenses 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Roads</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road 800,000 yuan</p>
<p>Xi'an-Hanzhong Road 350,000 yuan</p>
<p>Shaanxi-Gansu Transportation Agency 400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Public Health Veterinary Medicine and Livestock Improvement 600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Rural Cooperative 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total 4,350,000 yuan</p>
<p>The above proposed amended distribution amount is for reference only. Whether it is appropriate is still subject to correction. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Savings Bank Law (Continued) Lottery Savings Should Be Strictly Prohibited Mr. Ma Yinchu Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Ma Yinchu Talks about Prohibiting Lottery Savings. Ma Yinchu issued the following statement after the Legislative Yuan passed the Savings Bank Law: "When the Savings Bank Bill passed by the General Assembly today was submitted for discussion by President Sun, it can be said that it was unanimously passed by the entire audience and it was believed that it should be implemented quickly. Therefore, it was immediately submitted to the National Government for order and promulgation. It is expected to be implemented from July, because the original law stipulates that it will be implemented on the date of promulgation. As for cracking down on Wan Guozhongxi and other savings associations without hesitation, there will be no loss to the interests of depositors. Detailed opinions on this section are in my reasons for prohibition. The government should strictly supervise the various guarantees of lottery savings. The Ministry of Finance must have detailed measures. In this way, the huge amount of funds leaking from the vested interests can be recovered, and the legitimate savings of each bank can be guaranteed. On the one hand, the country already has methods to encourage legitimate savings, then each bank can also have great development in the savings business."</p>
<h3>Reasons for Prohibiting Prize Savings Societies</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma also published reasons for prohibiting prize savings societies, stating: "Prize savings harm the national economy to a profound and significant extent, necessitating thorough elimination. I am now briefly outlining several points below, hoping that various legal entities and public opinion representatives will unanimously support and widely publicize them to achieve the goal of abolishment, which would be a great fortune for the party and the nation." (1) The number of induced people is alarming. According to the Wan Guo Savings Society, the current total savings amount is approximately 65 million yuan, with over 116,800 members per term. The so-called "full member" pays 12 yuan per month; those paying 6 yuan are called "main members," and those paying 3 yuan are called "quarter members." In total, the number of absorbed savers is no less than 300,000 to 400,000, which is a significant concern. (2) Unequal treatment between Chinese and foreign entities is unavoidable. I drafted the Savings Bank Law, summarizing and quoting the savings bank regulations and proposals drafted by various parties since the late Qing Dynasty, which can be found in volumes 1, pages 475 to 534, of my collected essays. While the content may vary, there is unanimous agreement among all parties to ban prize savings. The Savings Bank Law passed today stipulates a ban on prize savings. Because the law strictly regulates genuine savings businesses, such as holding directors and supervisors jointly and severally liable, it is evident that the regulations are stringent. However, if the prize savings societies run by Chinese and foreign merchants are not mentioned at all, it would be unfair and cause pangs of conscience. The society's funds have already reached 60 to 70 million yuan. When it accumulates to 60 to 70 million yuan in the future, enforcement of the ban will be more difficult than it is today. If we don't act now, it will be too late to regret. (3) Overflow of lease rights. According to my recent investigation, the Wan Guo Savings Society has purchased the following properties: Shanghai Public Concession Works Bureau bonds, Hankou French Concession Works Bureau bonds, Shanghai Works Bureau bonds, Beijing Grand Hotel debentures, Siam Hotel Company debentures, Shanghai Ye Guang Company debentures, (foreign-run) English and French Real Estate Company debentures, Shanghai Puyi Real Estate Company preferred shares, Shanghai French General Association debentures, Hankou Western Merchants General Association debentures, Hankou Racecourse General Association debentures, Hankou French General Association debentures, Shanghai Yangpin Lending Bank shares, Shanghai China Construction Real Estate Company shares, Shanghai British Hengye Real Estate Limited Company Class A shares, Shanghai British Hengye Real Estate Limited Company Class B shares, Shanghai Huamao Real Estate Company shares, Shanghai Yeguang Real Estate Company shares, Siam Cement Company shares, Shanghai French Tram and Electrical Company shares, Shanghai American Asiatic Underwriters seven-percent preferred shares, Shanghai American Asiatic Underwriters eight-percent preferred shares, etc. From this, it can be seen that the funds absorbed from Chinese people are entirely used by foreigners. The exact amount is temporarily not disclosed. Sun Yat-sen had high hopes for building a new China. Utilizing foreign capital was a way to quickly achieve construction goals, as demonstrated by industrial plans. Today, we are not only unable to utilize foreign capital, but our own national funds are being used by foreigners. Chinese people are utilizing foreign capital, which has turned into foreigners utilizing domestic capital. If we don't strictly prohibit this, we will be betraying Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. (4) Contrary to the New Life Movement. The essence of the New Life Movement is to uphold propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and to be honest and not deceitful. However, prize savings societies aim to extract the lifeblood of our people through clever means. Where is the propriety? Savings are called "prize savings," and all savers have the hope of winning a prize, creating a situation of fierce competition, no different from gambling. The savers are all our compatriots, which is equivalent to leading our compatriots into injustice. The ancients said, "Do not acquire wealth by improper means," which is the key to integrity. Prize savings societies intend to deceive people for money, showing no integrity. Calling it insatiable greed would be quite accurate. Knowing that it is a scam, they still shamelessly call it savings, with no sense of shame. All of this is unbearable for those who promote the New Life Movement. (5) Severe embezzlement. According to the Wan Guo Savings Society's saving method, it is 12 yuan per month. If this amount were used for zero-deposit lump-sum savings, calculated at a monthly interest rate of 8%, compounded, after 15 years, the principal and interest would be 4,831 yuan. However, when the savings society matures, it only repays a principal of 2,000 yuan. The difference between the two amounts is 2,831 yuan, of which about 1,200 yuan is used for prizes, and the remaining 1,600 yuan is completely embezzled by people within the savings society. If one person is like this, imagine what it is like for more than 100,000 households. It's shocking! Moreover, it is developing rapidly. If we don't seek relief immediately, we may face a situation where it becomes too big to fail in the future. The calculation method for prize savings principal and interest can be found on pages 231 to 248 of the second volume of my lecture collection, so I won't elaborate further. (6) Hinders genuine savings. Our country's national funds are very limited, and those available for savings are even more limited. Usage and distribution are more abundant in this area, and must be smaller in that. Therefore, with the development of prize savings, the funds for genuine savings will inevitably be affected. To encourage genuine savings, we must strictly prohibit prize savings. (7) Improper handling by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance currently levies several types of taxes on prize savings societies: one is stamp tax, with a tax of 3 cents for those paying 3 yuan per month, 5 cents for those paying 6 yuan, 8 cents for those paying 9 yuan, and 10 cents for those paying 12 yuan and 15 yuan. The other is a special tax of 5 yuan per month for new savers, totaling 60 yuan per year, for a one-year limit. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's annual income from prize savings societies is considerable, but everyone knows the harm of prize savings. The government should find ways to eliminate it to avoid the misuse of national funds, so as not to betray the trust of the people. Now, the government is taking advantage of gambling opportunities to collect formal donations and taxes, which is equivalent to encouraging people to gamble. How can this be shown to the people? Moreover, we are now abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, and the disadvantages of this kind of donation and tax are far above excessive levies. The Ministry of Finance should set an example, remove this kind of evil tax, and not cherish the small income while letting it spread endlessly. Minister Kong strongly supported the ban at the Industrial and Commercial Conference in 1919. Now that he holds great power, he will surely follow his original aspirations and take swift action. (8) The absurdity of the winning numbers. The members of the Wan Guo and Zhongfa savings societies are scattered throughout the country, and they don't know each other. The lottery takes place in Shanghai. There is no permanent supervisory body, nor is there a fixed person to supervise. Whether the drawn numbers match those reported is impossible to prove. Whether the winners actually exist is also unknown. (5) Losses from savers mortgaging loans. The repayment period for savings is 15 years later, and during these 15 years, savers must pay monthly. Given the weakness of our people's resources and the instability of their jobs, few savers can pay to the end. On the contrary, many quit midway. However, the amount repaid when quitting is far less than the principal already paid. For example, if someone pays the full amount for two years, the principal would have reached 288 yuan, not counting interest. When quitting, the principal repaid is only over 90 yuan. The loss of interest is another matter. Those who use savings certificates to mortgage loans also borrow little. The amount withheld is enough to continue paying membership fees for one or a few years. If the loan is not repaid, the savings society will calculate it at compound interest, inevitably turning the saver into a debtor. Is there still hope of recovering the savings already paid? Their means of deception and exploitation can be said to be all-encompassing. (10) The head office is not responsible for the branches. Today, Wan Guo and Zhongfa savings societies not only set up agencies in trading ports, but also widely establish branches in the interior, using various scams on ignorant men and women. Once the savings are in hand, managers abscond with the money, which is often heard. The head office is not responsible, leaving the savers with no way to appeal, which is extremely painful. The incidents that occurred in Wuzhou and other branches can serve as a warning. (11) The harm of foreign prize savings is far above foreign banks. We often say that foreign banks absorb Chinese funds for the use of foreigners, which greatly harms our country's financial economy. Compared to prize savings, it is like comparing a small witch to a great one. Bank deposits still have interest to be earned, and the funds are mostly used for import trade with China. They don't have agencies in our country's interior. Prize savings societies are the opposite in every way. Not only do they not give much interest on the funds, but they also use them for speculative ventures, widely establishing branches in various counties and towns. Even the small savings from the hard work of ignorant men and women are the object of exploitation, and the harm is even greater. How can it be compared with foreign banks? (12) National dereliction of duty. The intentions of the savings society are as mentioned above, and it is truly unspeakable. The depth of the people's blind faith in foreigners must be severely corrected. The people have more faith in businesses run by foreigners. They rush to deposit money in a certain bank run by foreigners, fearing that it won't be accepted, and they have nowhere to entrust their safety. A certain savings society run by foreigners, they deeply believe, will never deceive them. They resolutely purchase savings with the hope of winning a big prize in the unlikely event. Among them, there are also a few Chinese people who greedily seek small profits and vigorously solicit customers, all of whom have failed in their national duty. (13) Prohibiting prize savings will not hinder the implementation of the Savings Bank Law. This Savings Bank Law was formulated with reference to the opinions of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Banking Association. Their important opinions were almost completely adopted, so this law can be implemented immediately after it is promulgated. Director Xu of the Ministry of Finance also advocated implementing it from July 1, and it must not be delayed due to the prohibition of prize savings. (14) Prohibiting prize savings is neither anti-foreign nor does it exclude any individual. I have always advocated prohibiting prize savings. In 1919, when I served as a consultant to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, I wrote two articles on the harm of prize savings and its calculation methods (now published in the second volume of my lecture collection). At that time, the Chinese bank that ran prize savings had extensive dealings with the Xingye Bank, saying that colleagues should not squeeze each other out. Mr. Chai Kuichu, the chairman of the Xingye Bank, asked me to step back. I argued for my position, so today's ban on prize savings is not anti-foreign, nor is it against any individual. Anyone who runs prize savings, whether it is a bank or a savings society, whether it is a foreigner or a Chinese, is opposed. (15) Prohibiting prize savings can prevent inland funds from flowing out. The ultimate goal is to make funds flow back into the</p>
<p>land and no longer allow inland funds to flow out. (16) Prohibiting prize savings is not afraid of embezzlement and absconding. Some say that once prize savings are prohibited, the people running them may abscond with the money. This need not be worried about. The chairman and directors of the Zhongfa Savings Society are Chinese, and the Wan Guo Savings Society also has Chinese directors. Its properties, such as bonds and mortgages, are kept by HSBC and Banque de l'Indochine, which issue receipts for safekeeping, and they are verified by Chinese and Western directors, auditors, and British auditing specialists. Since there are Chinese directors involved, absconding seems unlikely. This is the first reason. Even if they abscond, it is still worthwhile. For example, regarding those who pay the full amount for two years and then quit, as mentioned in item nine, although they lose over 190 yuan, if the 12 yuan per month is deposited in a bank, the interest earned by the end of the fifteenth year will be greater than the loss, and the loss will be even greater if they continue to pay. This is the second reason. Moreover, of the 65 million yuan in savings of the Wan Guo Savings Society, 20 million has already been lent to savers, so it will not be completely lost. This is the third reason. The Wan Guo Savings Society lends money to various companies, and the directors and supervisors of various companies also have Chinese people involved. For example, the amount invested by the Wan Guo Savings Society in Chinese business companies is no less than 3 to 4 million, and the directors and supervisors of Chinese business companies have Chinese people involved, and they are very influential people. It is not easy to abscond. This is the fourth reason. Therefore, I am not afraid of them absconding. (End)</p>

<h3>Mongolians' Forehead-Touching Marriage and Sky Burial, Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on May 1st, I visited the Rulai Ji Ling Temple. The temple is about two or three li away from the lodging. The halls, towers, and platforms are all built of white mud, as white as chalk. It can be seen from more than ten li away. There are Mongolian yurts inside for lamas to store food. There are two large halls, east and west. The east hall enshrines Buddha statues such as the Tathagata, which are still solemn, and there are many valuable items on display. The west hall enshrines images of deities and monsters such as Garan, Ox-Head, and Horse-Face. In the middle is the so-called "Happy Buddha" (Mongolian name "Demu Queke"), which is a male Buddha with four faces, entering arms, raised eyebrows, and exposed teeth, holding a jade-faced goddess with disheveled hair, both naked in an intimate posture, covered with yellow silk below. The lama instructed to lift the silk to view it, but the lewdness of it must be more than obscene spring paintings. When I asked about the origin of the Buddha, the lama stared blankly and couldn't answer. Mr. Zhu, who was traveling with me, said, "This probably symbolizes the primordial chaos, the creation of things and people, just like the Eight Trigrams of Fu Xi, the principle of yin and yang, but the latter is more elegant in conception, while the former is particularly vulgar in form." If that's the case, sculpting and placing it in temples, where lamas face it morning and evening, is not appropriate.</p>
<p>The tour guide lama was named "Dongdun." At first, he suspected that we were outsiders and refused to open the door. He spoke through the window and answered with "Mo de gui" (meaning "I don't know"). Later, Mr. Zhu explained our intentions in detail, and he began to speak Chinese and asked, "Are you from the 'Southern Government'?" Then he opened the door to welcome us and said that he "became a lama at the age of nine, went to Beijing at the age of twenty-five, and has three brothers, all of whom are lamas except for the youngest son, who lives as a layman. The meat and food needed in the temple (Mongolian lamas don't abstain from meat) are supplied by the family. He recites scriptures once a day in the temple, called small recitation. On the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month and the birthdays of the Buddhas, it is called big recitation. There are many lamas for the big recitation, and the expenses are all paid by the temple. The bells and drums are loud and very lively." On his bed was a red lacquer wooden box. When opened, it contained fried rice, ghee, tea bricks, etc., and a small photo of the Panchen Lama. There were several plasterers, originally from Shaanxi, who came here to suffer (doing work is called suffering, which is a common saying in the grasslands). For more than ten years, they talked in detail about Mongolian customs. The lamas stood around listening quietly and corrected any mistakes. The details discussed are briefly recorded below.</p>
<p>Mongolians are brave and don't engage in farming. They specialize in nomadic life. Both men and women are good at riding. Men especially like to race. Up and down the valleys,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>they are as fast as the wind. If they get sick, they burn themselves on the right side and don't tell anyone. Their food consists of mutton and cheese, which they own. Fried rice and clothing are mostly exchanged for sheep. Near the border, their food and housing have gradually become Sinicized. On the lunar New Year's Day, the royal family and nobles live in non-Mongolian yurts and still use Mongolian Spring Festival couplets. Ordinary people go to the Zhaomiao Temple, kowtow to the lamas, and after returning to the yurt for tea, those who pray for blessings or seek recovery from illness go outside the temple and circle it more than ten times. When relatives and friends meet, few pay respects. On this day, giving fire to others is most taboo. Eating meat is more plentiful than usual. If the elders or lamas give a Hada (a kind of silk fabric) or a horse's head and sheep's tail, the recipient will regard it as the highest honor and auspiciousness. On the fifteenth day, they invite the Grand Lama to touch their foreheads. The lama uses a wooden pole to tie red cloth and strikes each forehead. If struck, they are happy; otherwise, they wait for a long time and don't leave. The lamas of each temple have a big recitation from the New Year's Day to the fifteenth day, and also in June. The Grand Lama is also called the Living Buddha, sits in the hall and chants scriptures. The other thirty-two lamas wear python robes and colorful clothes, and wear masks on their heads, disguised as heavenly kings, Bodhisattvas, Ox-Head and Horse-Face images, beating drums and cymbals, eating large trumpets, sometimes dancing in pairs, sometimes jumping together. There is a ghost, kneaded with ghee and flour, its color is reddish brown, placed in a triangular wooden plate, lined with a triangular silk painting of a heavenly king, the plate is placed on the ground, and all the deity images dressed by the lamas make a suppressing gesture towards him one by one, and then dismember him with a wooden sword, chanting sutras, drumming and gongs, sending them far outside the temple and returning. On this day, the officiating lamas collect a lot of donations from the people (This kind of "big chanting" ceremony is also held in the Lama Temple in Beiping every year on the 29th day of the second lunar month. Spectators fill the road and call it "beating ghosts" or "dancing ghosts."</p>
<p>When parents die, men and women cry, ask the lamas to choose the burial, place the corpse in the desert or hills, and chant sutras to bless the dead to ascend to heaven. The next day, or three days later, they go to see, if birds and beasts (mostly domestic dogs) eat it, it is auspicious; otherwise, they ask the lamas to pray again and move the corpse to another place, and it must be eaten by birds and beasts before it is finished. This is called "sky burial." If it is a Grand Lama or a wealthy family, the corpse is carried to a stove pit behind the mountain and burned, which is called "cremation." The children of the deceased untie their braids, wear their clothes inside out, and stop after a month. They also invite lamas to chant sutras on every anniversary, and some cry on New Year's Eve, but they don't go to the grave to worship.</p>
<p>Marriage is determined by matchmakers, by private agreement, or by horse racing to determine the choice. The marriage age is mostly seventeen or eighteen for men and fifteen or sixteen for women. The wedding gifts and dowry are not fixed. The wedding is mostly at sunset. The groom rides a horse to the bride's house, and the father-in-law welcomes him in, kneels to his parents-in-law, and presents gifts. The bride sits in another room with a cloth covering her face. The matchmaker leads the groom to untie the braids of the two, and they bathe in the same basin. Then the groom divides a cooked sheep's neck into two and eats it with the bride, and then goes to the father-in-law's banquet. After the banquet, he says goodbye and returns. The bride goes with him, both riding good horses. When they arrive, a fire is set up outside the yurt, and the couple dismount and worship it together, saying "worship the stove god." Then they worship the parents-in-law and elders, set up a banquet for the guests, and laugh and joke until dawn. The next night, another yurt is set up for them to live together for three days, and then they return to the bride's house. The groom stays for three days, and then they return together. After marriage, no matter internally or externally, the woman's responsibility is always greater than the man's. Men are mostly idle, and women are mostly diligent. This is probably a common phenomenon. Some cattle and sheep property is jointly operated, and some is managed separately. If the husband and wife disagree, they divorce by throwing soil.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, we started from the Rulai Ji Ling Temple. The weather suddenly became hot, and we opened our clothes to face the wind. Old artemisia had just sprouted new leaves, four or five points long, and Malan flowers were also in full bloom everywhere. After thirty li, we passed a hillside with overlapping yellow stone layers, shaped like autumn clouds. There was a well under the stone, more than ten zhang deep. Three li away from the well, we saw three or four rooms of Banshen, more than two hundred sheep and dozens of white horses. To the west of the road was a depression, a lake with a circumference of about twenty li. The sandy beach by the lake was as white as frost. At night, we passed a salt beach about eight li long. The surface layer was white and hard, and the inside was soft soil and thin mud. Several camels sank and couldn't get up. When whipped, they made a long cry, which was unbearable to hear. The camels carried three to four hundred catties and walked fifty to sixty li. How could they not be tired in the dark night on the mud beach? Salt is an essential element for human life, but no one collected it. Abandoning the goods on the ground was harmful, which was regrettable. Later, it took a lot of effort to reach the dry land, called Zao Shu, and stayed there. That day, we traveled seventy li. There was a deep well. The place was called Zao Shu, which must have trees, but it was barren, just like the previous few days, which was very disappointing.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Bandits Plan to Flee to the Yangtze River Basin, Exhausting Food in Tongjiang, the Red Bandits Flee From Chengkou to Wanyuan</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The military campaign against the bandits in Sichuan Province has been going on for more than a year and has not been completely resolved. The process can be divided into four periods: the first was the fall of more than ten counties in northern Sichuan, the heyday of the Red Bandits; the second was the inauguration of Liu Xiang and the general offensive by the National Army; the third was the recovery of Sui and Xuan, the period of the Red Bandits' defense; and the fourth was the counter-offensive by the Red Bandits, the period of attempting to flee. The decline of the bandit forces is already evident, but although the area occupied by the bandits has shrunk, they still have tens of thousands of people. Wanyuan and Tongjiang counties are still within their sphere of influence. The mountains are high and the city is steep, making it impossible to capture them suddenly. Recently, because Tongjiang has exhausted its food, they will decide to abandon it and concentrate their forces in Chengkou, Wanyuan to flee east to the Yangtze River Basin, or retreat north to Zhenba, waiting for an opportunity to flee. The bandits in front of Tongjiang have begun to move backward. The Xu and Fan divisions are preparing to follow up and pursue, so as to capture Tongjiang in one go. Tang also ordered strict prevention of the eastward flight. The left and right wings can meet within days. On the 19th and 21st, Tang reported to Hankou in detail on the progress of the campaign and the Red Bandits' plans, which are briefly recorded as follows: (1) Since this road launched a fierce attack on Wanyuan, although all departments have made progress, the mountains are dangerous and the attack is difficult. The bandits resisted stubbornly and launched repeated counter-attacks with a large force. The 9th and 11th were particularly fierce. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers calmly performed their duties, so they did not succeed. They are now strictly isolating and reorganizing on the new line, waiting for the general attack. However, according to investigations by various departments and confessions from prisoners and bandits, the main force of the 49th, 30th and other armies are now in the area. The entire 33rd Army is in the Dazhu River area. The 4th Army's 75th Regiment and the 9th Army's 73rd and 77th Regiments are in the Huangzhongbao and Lizia areas. The entire 12th Division and one division each from the 9th and 30th Armies are in the Houping, Daping, and Kongjiashan areas. The majority of the 30th Army, three to four thousand people, are in the Guanchangba, Shimahe, and Qiujialiang areas. They have been fleeing fiercely to Chengkou, Shuangkouhe, and Bataishan in recent days. According to reports, bandit leader Xu Xiangqian is now seriously ill, and the troops are commanded by Zhang Guotao. Zhang declared to the bandits in Wanyuan that Tongjiang had exhausted its food and would be abandoned immediately, and that it would flee east to Chengkou and Wanyuan, where salt and rice would be convenient. It was found that the elite bandits were concentrated on the right wing of this road and had been attacking Chengkou and Bataishan fiercely for days. Their intention to flee east is clear. In addition to ordering strict prevention, a special telegram was sent for your information. (2) Local businessmen and people who escaped from the bandit area yesterday reported that Xu bandit held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided on three measures: 1. Defend Tongjiang as appropriate; 2. If Tongjiang cannot be defended, retreat to Zhenma Ziyang and fight a decisive battle in the fall; 3. Concentrate on Chengkou and Wanyuan and take the opportunity to flee east to the Yangtze River to open up a new situation. According to reports from Division Commander Xu Yaoqing and Fan Shaozeng Ma Chen, the bandits on our front from Qin Jiahe, Zhenlongguan, Yankouhe Liuping, and Wumuchang retreated completely to Caobachang, Xindianzi, Machang, Shichang, and Tongjiang on the night of the 20th. It seems that the bandits have abandoned the first method and will adopt the second and third methods. In addition to ordering Division Xu to send troops to firmly occupy the Zhenlongguan Pass, to follow up and pursue the bandits, and to order Division Fan to occupy Tongjiang, the right wing departments were ordered to continue to advance. Special report, (22nd).</p>
<h3>After Bandit Gao Jumped Off a Cliff and Died, His Wife Who Kidnapped and Sold People Was Captured, The Suppression of the Red Bandits in Northwest Jiangxi Is Imminent</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, bandit leader Gao Yongsheng, was a pseudo-Central Committee member, had studied in Russia, and was a backbone of the Red Bandits. Last year, after the pseudo-Central Committee transferred bandit Kong Hechong to Ruijin for training, the remaining troops of bandit Kong were led by bandit Gao to wreak havoc in northwest Jiangxi, which was extremely cruel. His crimes were so great that he was captured by the National Army a few days ago. The bandit realized that he could not escape being publicly executed, so he pretended to defecate and tried to escape by jumping off a cliff. Then the bandit's body was discovered. After confirmation by the garrison and Commissioner Cao, the bandit had indeed jumped off a cliff and died. His head was cut off. The Red Bandits in Northwest Jiangxi, the giant culprit has been beheaded, and it will not be difficult to completely eliminate them in the near future. According to sources, Gao bandit's wife was also captured by the Second Column of the National Army in Pingxiang and has now been escorted to Pingxiang for interrogation. (June 22nd)</p>
<h3>Three Provinces Headquarters Regulations: Measures for Recruiting Bandits to Surrender, Showing Lenience and Generosity to Accelerate Bandit Collapse</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, considering that the remnant bandits in the three provinces have been repeatedly and severely suppressed, and an internal collapse is already apparent, with only the forces of Xu Haidong, Wu Huanxian, and others, numbering two to three thousand, fleeing in eastern Hubei, surrounded by various armies, the time for complete pacification is not far off. However, as there are many awakened elements among those who followed the bandits, in order to achieve complete success by simultaneously carrying out suppression and appeasement, and combining both force and leniency, a broad path to self-renewal should be opened up. Therefore, five points of measures have been specifically stipulated and communicated to all bandit suppression armies for strict compliance. The original order is as follows: "Considering that the remnant bandits in the three provinces are increasingly impoverished, this headquarters has been ordered to supervise their suppression, and complete pacification is imminent. However, while suppressing bandits and quelling rebellion relies on military force, guiding the situation to our advantage is also extremely important. Although there are many extremely wicked individuals among the bandits, there must also be many who are subjugated by coercion and forced to act against their will. In particular, the masses in the bandit areas have suffered greatly from the oppression of the bandits, have no way to survive, and their suffering is truly pitiful. Now that the national army is encircling and suppressing them, a situation of mutual destruction is imminent. Even if they are fortunate enough to escape, prolonged blockade will inevitably lead to the same fate. At this time, there must be many awakened elements who intend to surrender and return. Recently, according to the commander of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui border region, stationed in Huaidian, a telegram from subordinate Brigade Commander Wang stated that Xu Yizong, the false chairman of the sixth township of the second district, Xu Yiqian, a member of the executive committee, bandit soldiers and bandit civilians Xu Die and others, have surrendered with weapons. According to the confession of the false chairman Xu Yizong, the township is located in the Guanyintang Huwan area. They have already understood the deceptive tricks of the bandits and feel that the bandit area is extremely difficult, plagued by poverty and disease, and unable to survive. Therefore, the masses, carrying guns, risked their lives to surrender. If they are granted self-renewal, they are willing to serve the national army to redeem their previous crimes. They also stated that many bandit soldiers and bandit civilians in the bandit area have now awakened, but because the bandit leaders spread propaganda that our side executes all prisoners and surrendering individuals, they are hesitant and dare not try. Furthermore, in Jiangxi, important figures from the bandit side, such as various political commissars, have recently awakened and returned with the people. These situations prove that the internal affairs of the bandit army have already shown signs of collapse. The impact of this is of great importance. In order to broadly open up a path to self-renewal for the awakened elements on the bandit side, and to accelerate the collapse of the bandit forces, the following points to be noted have been established: (1) All military, political, and training personnel should vigorously promote the national army's leniency and generosity towards self-renewing elements. Those who surrender will not only not be held accountable for their past actions but will also be rewarded according to regulations. The specific facts of the national army's previous leniency towards all self-renewing elements should be widely publicized. (2) During frontline operations, each army should make simple slogans and try to distribute them within the bandit army to persuade them to surrender. Furthermore, slogans to be shouted by soldiers should be formulated, such as 'The national army treats surrendering elements well,' 'Those who do not want to be bandits, come here,' 'Those who surrender with weapons will be heavily rewarded,' 'Only surrendering to the national army is survival.' When our army approaches the bandit army, soldiers should shout these slogans to the red bandit masses. (3) Each army should conduct strict investigations into the words, actions, and thoughts of the red bandits who voluntarily surrender to prevent the red bandits from taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out their conspiracy of agitation and incitement. However, during the investigation period, efforts should be made to ensure that the surrendering individuals do not experience significant mental or material suffering to avoid hindering the path to self-renewal. (4) Each army should, within the possible range, persuade captured or imprisoned red bandits to renew themselves. During interrogation, non-criminal torture should be avoided as much as possible. Instead, they should be informed of the political situation in China and the crimes of the red bandits, so that they can voluntarily express their sincerity to the national army. (5) All self-renewing elements, after investigation and training, and when they are truly sincere towards the national army, should be properly settled and given work according to their abilities, and they should not be left idle. All of the above points must be strictly observed in order to achieve the great effect of simultaneously suppressing and appeasing, establish the moral authority of combining both force and leniency, and ensure our military victory and the early completion of our efforts. The future of bandit suppression truly relies on this. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered that you comply and immediately forward the instructions to your subordinates for unified compliance, and report the handling situation to be filed for future reference. This order is issued by Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang." (21st)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Robbery of Pilgrims Solved, Principal Culprit Apprehended</h3>
<p>Shen Xuetao, the owner of Dingchang Paper Store outside the East Gate of this county, along with companions Chen Guoxiang, Zhou Shengfa, and more than ten others, went to Mount Wutai on a pilgrimage. Unfortunately, they encountered a robbery in Dingzhou. As previously reported, his family member, Shen Zhipeng, received a letter from Gu Baoshan, the director of the Beiping Telegraph Bureau, detailing Shen's encounter with the robbery and the situation of the capture, stating briefly that Xuetao took a Pinghan train to Dingzhou on the morning of the 18th of last month and hired ten donkey carts. About ten miles into the journey, two robbers on bicycles chased them. One held a pistol, and the other held a bayonet. The Yang couple in the first cart escaped. Xuetao, sitting in the second cart, was stopped and searched by the robbers under the pretext of searching for contraband. The cash of more than two thousand yuan that the pilgrims had with them was all looted. Xuetao knelt down and begged for a small amount of travel expenses to return home. The robbers, seeing Xuetao holding onto their clothes and seeing that there were many pilgrims, feared resentment and shot Shen Xuetao in the lower breast, killing him on the spot. The robbers then fled. After the incident, Guanghui, the abbot of Pujisi Temple on Mount Wutai, and Gu Shi, a small shop owner from Shanghai, recovered the body to the town, bought a coffin, and held a memorial service at Pujisi Temple, ordering the monks of the entire mountain to chant scriptures to comfort the soul. Master Guanghui went to Tianjin to visit Chairman Yu Xuezhong and requested the arrest of the murderer. The principal culprit, Yang, and the accomplice, Li, have now been arrested and interrogated. They will be sent to the scene of the crime in Dingzhou for execution to deter bandits. It is said that Shen's coffin will be returned in mid-October. Chen Guoxiang, Zhou Shengfa, and others who accompanied him have not yet returned to Songjiang.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Garment Workers Cause More Disturbances</h3>
<p>Since the strike in the garment industry in Wu County, the county party headquarters considered the industry's trade association to be poorly organized and ordered it to cease activities. On the afternoon of the 22nd, at 4:00 PM, it convened a meeting of members. Unexpectedly, some non-members misunderstood, and more than a hundred workers went to the county party headquarters. Led by Fan Jiqing, Teng Yuanquan, and others, they made two requests to the party headquarters: (1) Remove all existing personnel from the trade association; (2) When the trade association is reorganized, the name must be changed to the Garment Workers Association. After an explanation by Secretary Xu, they withdrew. At that time, six representatives from the trade association, including Lu Chunjiang, were present. After a conversation with Standing Committee Member Zhu, they withdrew. Unexpectedly, as soon as they left the gate, the six representatives were surrounded by workers. Lu Chunjiang and Cai Heshang were seized and taken to Xuanyuan Hall. Xiao, the police officer in charge of the police district, ordered Lu, Cai, and Teng Yuanquan to return. Lu and Cai provided surety and were released.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Guangdong Man Comes to Jiading to Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 22nd, a young man in a Western suit arrived at Wangxianqiao Town in the western countryside and hired a Jiangbei pontoon boat to Suzhou, saying that the boat fare was five yuan. The townspeople found it strange that he did not take the train but hired a small boat that was not suitable in terms of time and money. When asked about his background, he gave evasive answers. Later, the young man took out a security razor in a small teahouse and slashed his throat to commit suicide. He was stopped, but his throat had already been cut open for more than two inches, and blood was gushing, staining his chest and abdomen. Wu Zongqi, the town mayor, quickly bandaged him and reported the incident to the Wai Gang Public Security Substation, which ordered the police to meet and take him to the station. According to Xie Bin, from Taishan County, Guangdong, unemployed, he committed suicide because he was addicted to opium and let down his friends. A business card found on him was engraved with Xie Yunwu, a graduate of Meiji University in Japan, Xie Chen, Xie Langchen, etc. It is not known which name is correct. He also had a letter addressed to Cui Youyu in Huanglongdong, Songmutiang, Hangzhou, which read: "Xie Junxiong is going to Hangzhou to avoid misfortune and plans to stay with you for a short time. Please provide accommodation. Sincerely, Guan Tingbin." It appeared that Guan had introduced him to Cui. There was also a diary with contact information for friends, including Lu Jiawang at No. 18, Wu Fang, Ximen Road, Shanghai, He Yiming, Deputy Adjutant of the Suzhou Tax Police Regiment, and Guan Chongbi, Chief of the Jiangsu Wuxi Station Police Section. A document was immediately prepared and sent to the county government through the County Public Security Bureau. County Magistrate Xu ordered him to be sent to Jiading Hospital. Dr. Geng Shiting examined him and found that the trachea and esophagus were not broken. When asked for his real name, he did not answer, saying only that life was meaningless because he was too distressed. When asked again, he claimed to be mentally disturbed and refused to reveal anything. After treatment, he was asked to leave the hospital. When they insisted on keeping him, he struggled and ran out. He was ordered to track him down and hand him over to the Public Security Bureau to have his friends claim him to avoid further accidents.</p>
<h3>Wujiang: Counterfeit Money Found at Bus Station</h3>
<p>The bicycle team of the County Public Security Bureau discovered two criminals, Liu Pinshan and He Yunhui, at the Suzhou-Jiahe Road bus station, who were using counterfeit money from the Central Bank to make purchases at Shengjia Store, Wu Xiangxing, Tongrenhe, Shangjielu and other shops in the city. A large amount of counterfeit money and real money was confiscated on the spot and sent to the County Government. After a court hearing, Liu and He were each fined 300 yuan, but the source of the counterfeit money was not investigated. It is now heard that the shops, considering the county government's sentence too lenient, have jointly requested the county chamber of commerce to send a telegram to the Central Bank, ordering the county to investigate the case to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Husband Has an Affair, Wife Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Chen Jinnian, a 35-year-old accountant at Taichang Shipping Bureau under Gongyun Bridge in this city, married Guo Hongying and has a son, four years old. The couple had a harmonious relationship, but Jinnian was fond of women. Last winter, he became acquainted with Jin Aizhen, a romantic young woman. When Hongying learned of the affair, conflicts arose. In her anger, Guo repeatedly attempted suicide, more than fifteen times. Recently, she jumped into the river under Gongyun Bridge, but was rescued and did not die. The day before yesterday, Guo, taking advantage of Jinnian's absence, privately purchased raw opium at her residence at No. 4 Wangren Lane and swallowed it to commit suicide. She groaned in bed. Li, who lived with her, heard the noise, knew something was wrong, immediately opened the door and entered the room. She saw Guo's face pale, lying stiffly on the bed, tears in her eyes. Knowing she had taken poison, she immediately sent Guo to Dr. Zhang Jimin's clinic under Tonghui Bridge for two life-saving injections, and then transferred her to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Her life is now out of danger.</p>
<h3>Search for Red Pills Sparks Repercussions</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the County Anti-Smoking Bureau, the investigation section chief has been Chen Yuchu, the original member of the Public Security Bureau and Anti-Smoking Committee. In recent days, the Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate and various branches have been diligently searching, with more than a dozen cases every day. The various red pill dens and "swallow nests" (opium dens) are facing their doom. Yesterday, at 6:30 AM, as soon as the Li Wansheng Candle Shop outside the North Gate, in Tantou Lane, opened, more than 30 armed patrolmen from the Public Security Bureau Inspectorate suddenly spread out as sentries, prohibiting traffic and searching the shop for red pills. They searched the shop, dormitory, and kitchen, thoroughly searching every corner. As a result, they found nothing and left in disappointment. Afterwards, the shop felt that it had been searched for no reason and feared that it would encourage false accusations and framing. The trade association requested the county government to strictly investigate the reporter to maintain the market and social order. The shop is opened by a Ningbo native, Shen. Therefore, Wu Zhihe, chairman of the Ning Shao Fellow Association, personally requested Chen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to thoroughly investigate the truth. At the same time, Qian Sunqing, Li Tiping, and Cheng Jingtang, members of the County Anti-Smoking Committee, also sent a letter to Chairman Yan requesting to temporarily postpone the large-scale inspections before the official ointment shop opens and smokers register and receive permits to avoid disturbance and maintain order.</p>
<h3>County Land Bureau Established</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Land Bureau Preparatory Office has been established for more than half a year. Recently, the preparatory work has been completed, and the declaration of land prices is about to begin. Hu Pinfang, director of the preparatory office, prepared a report and submitted it to the provincial government for the establishment of the Land Bureau. It has now been approved. Hu Pinfang was appointed as the director, and the bureau was established immediately to actively handle land declarations.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: High School Student Entrance Exam Concludes</h3>
<p>The graduation examination for high school students in Jiangsu Province was held in districts, dividing the province into nine districts. Wujin belonged to the second district. The examiner was Wang Delin, editor of the Education Department, and the supervisors were Cai Pei, Wujin County Magistrate, and Qian Hao, Director of the Education Bureau. The examination was held upstairs in the auditorium of the Provincial Changzhou High School. A total of 49 students from Provincial Changzhou High School and 22 students from Private Changzhou High School participated in the examination. On the morning of June 20, they took the Chinese Language test, and in the afternoon, the Party Principles and History tests. On the morning of the 21st, they took the Mathematics test, and in the afternoon, the Geography test. On the morning of the 22nd, they took the English test, and in the afternoon, the Physics test. On the morning of the 23rd, they took the Chemistry test, and in the afternoon, the Biology test. After today (23rd), the examiner will take the exam papers to the Education Department to evaluate the quality and determine whether the students will graduate.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Protection Corps Temporarily Postponed Reorganization</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Bao, according to the order of the Provincial Security Office, ordered the existing temporary protection corps and police team to be merged into a protection team. However, Jiangyin had no temporary protection organization. In addition to reorganizing the original police team's squadron and independent detachment into the first squadron of the protection team, more than a thousand volunteer members of other protection corps, with more than 1,470 firearms, should be handled. Also, how should the expenses of the original police team, one squadron, and one independent detachment be offset against the expenses of the reorganized first squadron, which is insufficient? Furthermore, should the protection corps headquarters follow the organizational chart issued by the province and reduce expenses? The decision was made at the political affairs meeting on the 21st: (1) The police force in this county is weak and relies on volunteer members of the protection corps to defend the peace. The security of each township can be maintained. All firearms are also purchased by donations from various places. How should they be organized? The general headquarters of the county protection corps will discuss the measures and submit them to the Security Office for approval. (2) The regular expenses of the original police team, one squadron, and one independent detachment, will be reorganized into the first squadron according to the measures issued by the province. The incidental expenses will still be distributed according to the original amount. (3) The expenses of the protection corps in this county have not yet been determined. The general headquarters of the protection corps will postpone the reorganization.</p>
<h3>District, Township, and Town Boundaries Confirmed</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department ordered the county to reorganize the district, township, and town boundaries. The county government has reduced the 14 districts in the county to 7 districts. Li Dichen and others, the heads of the 7 districts, were also appointed by the county and approved by the Civil Affairs Department. The implementation will begin on July 1. The standards for the distribution of autonomous funds for districts, townships, and towns are as follows: (A) District Office expenses: (1) Grade A: Districts with a population of more than 100,000 (3 districts), each district receives 200 yuan per month; (2) Grade B: Districts with a population of less than 100,000 (4 districts), each district receives 100 yuan per month; (B) Township and Town Office expenses: (1) Grade A: Townships and towns with a population of more than 6,000 (36 townships and towns), each township and town receives 12 yuan per month; (2) Grade B: Townships and towns with a population of less than 6,000 (92 townships and towns), each township and town receives 10 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Sexagenarian Commits Suicide Due to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Yao Changsheng from Suzhou, nearly sixty years old, used to be a guard in the Suzhou Security Corps. Later, he was dismissed due to an incident. He came to Zhenjiang to seek employment and lived at No. 6, Niunaifang, Xi Chengwai, Jingji Ridge, the home of his nephew Yao Guoxi. He repeatedly asked friends for recommendations. Unexpectedly, he lived there for several years without finding a place to settle down and was very depressed. Yesterday, he said to his nephew, "I am going to Baogai Mountain to talk to a friend," and then went out. He did not return by lunchtime. Guoxi was suspicious. When he did not return by dinner, Guoxi was even more surprised. He went to the homes of various friends to inquire and learned that he had borrowed one yuan from a friend and purchased raw opium to swallow. Guoxi was shocked and led people to Baogai Mountain to find him. He found his uncle lying on the grass, barely breathing. He immediately hired a cart and sent him to the hospital for treatment. Because it was too late, the operation was ineffective. His life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Dispute After Military Judge's Death</h3>
<p>Qu Yaodong, a native of this city, served as a military judge in the Wei Lihuang Eastern Route Army Frontline Headquarters. He traveled to northern Fujian, but due to acclimatization, he returned home sick. Due to the fatigue of the journey, he passed away. On the day of the funeral, his ex-wife, Xing Dezhi, who was already divorced, suddenly returned home and argued with Qu's wife, Wu Yongcheng, over the mourning clothes and jumped into the coffin, causing a great commotion. Wu Yongcheng filed a complaint with the court against Xing on the 22nd. Xing was summoned by the criminal court but did not appear. The summons will continue to be issued.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Tragedy of Bomb Explosion</h3>
<p>In Xinglong'an, Houhezhen in the tenth district of this county, six blacksmiths from Funing have been making wheat sickles and farm tools since last month. Their business is quite good. The day before yesterday, due to a shortage of raw materials, they went to Xinghua to purchase a boatload of scrap iron. Yesterday, they picked out three iron balls similar to weighing hammers and put them into the furnace to forge. Unexpectedly, a moment after entering the furnace, they suddenly exploded with a loud noise. The anvil flew with the sound, killing three blacksmiths. Two had their arms broken, and one had his head blown off. Blood and flesh flew everywhere. The blacksmith owner, Mao, prepared coffins, collected the bodies, and transported them back to his hometown.</p>
<h3>Tenth District Plagued by Locusts</h3>
<p>The area of Xiajiaji and Zhoujin Township in the tenth district of the county has recently experienced dry weather. Locusts have been found covering the fields and gnawing on rice seedlings, causing great damage. Although the locust control officers of each township have worked hard to catch and kill them, there are too many locusts, making it difficult to eliminate them. If it does not rain again, once the locusts take flight, a locust plague will be inevitable.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Rascal Attempts Rape, Commits Assault</h3>
<p>Wang, the wife of farmer Huang Laoer in Rixin Township, third district, is over thirty years old and has a bit of beauty. Yesterday (21st) at dusk, Huang went out due to business. Suddenly, a rascal, Lu Bao San, broke into the room, grabbed Wang, and pressed her to the ground, intending to rape her. Wang screamed for help. Lu, failing to get what he wanted, took a kitchen knife and slashed Wang's left leg twice, causing blood to flow like a river and seriously injuring her. When neighbors heard the sound and came over, Lu had already fled. Today (22nd), Huang has filed a complaint with the county government for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Arsonist Burns Two Children to Death</h3>
<p>Lu Xiaolin, a farmer in Letong Township, sixth district, is of modest means. He had a long-standing feud with Wang, who lived nearby. The day before yesterday (20th) at midnight, Wang set fire to Lu's thatched house. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air, and flames soared. Lu was awakened from his dream and rang the gong to call for help. However, the weather was dry and the wind was strong, making it difficult to stop the fire. The five thatched houses and belongings were all reduced to ashes. Lu's wife, Chen, was injured on the head while fleeing in a hurry. A one-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl were unable to escape and were buried in the fire. It was a tragedy.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Hundreds of Road Workers Fight Villagers</h3>
<p>The Ningchuan Highway has been under construction for more than a year. Most of the road construction has been completed and is scheduled to open to traffic on the first day of next month. However, the section in Shanmen Township, sixth district of Zhenhai, has not yet been completed. Therefore, the company recently sent many workers to the area to rush construction. Wang Ruilin and other contractors will be able to complete the work soon. The day before yesterday, a resident, Shi Yanchang, and others, for some unknown reason, had an argument with the road workers. Then, both sides gathered their accomplices and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. More than a hundred road workers, lacking weapons, swarmed to Xiapu and looted all the meat cleavers from the meat shops in the market as weapons. The order was disrupted for a time and could not be restored. Fortunately, the military and police nearby heard the news and sent a team to disperse the road workers, and the matter was settled. However, villagers Ni Xiaoliu, Zhang Biao, Shi Yanchang, Chen Er, etc., were all seriously injured and taken away by the road workers. Their fate is uncertain. The military and police agencies are currently investigating the perpetrators and rescuing the abducted villagers.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Southern Qianqing Bandits Rob Night Boat</h3>
<p>The Xiaoshan Xixing Cao'e night boat, sailing to Southern Qianqing on the night of the 21st, suddenly encountered a bandit boat. More than ten bandits boarded the boat and looted wildly, taking more than seventy yuan of silver dollars and clothing worth more than a hundred yuan from the passengers. Also, two foreign letters on the boat, worth more than thirty yuan, and four bolts of silk, worth more than two hundred yuan, were also taken. The boatman, A Gui, was stabbed in five places by a bandit's knife, but fortunately, none of the wounds were fatal, and his life is not in danger. The boatman has reported the incident to the maritime and land public security agencies of Shao and Xiao counties for joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Occurs in Qidu Mountain</h3>
<p>A farmer, Zhu Ayuan, at the foot of Qidu Mountain in southern Xiaoshan, had a dispute with a neighbor over a field ridge. On the 20th, Ayuan led the neighbor's cow back home and killed it. The neighbor, surnamed Zhang, learned of this and gathered more than ten people to destroy Zhu's house and stabbed Ayuan five times in vital areas, killing him on the spot. Ayuan's five-year-old son was thrown into a dung pit and drowned. The whole village is now outraged and has reported the incident to the provincial and county authorities, requesting that the perpetrators be severely punished to maintain local peace. It is unknown how this murder case will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Letter from Henan Evening News</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We have read the news article "Head-Shaking Case Judgement" published in your newspaper on June 15, which is quite different from the facts. This case was judged in Zheng County Court on May 14, and the original judgment has been revoked. There is no word "one month" in the judgment. This is a matter of honor and disgrace for the entire journalism community. Please correct it. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Will Not Come to Shanghai, Will Go Directly to Hangzhou from Nanjing Tomorrow, Whether to Return to Fenghua Will Be Decided After Arriving in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency: Regarding the news that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission will come to Shanghai, Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, told Xin Xin News Agency reporters yesterday that Chiang is scheduled to leave Nanjing tomorrow (today) and go directly to Hangzhou to inspect the highways of five provinces. He will not come to Shanghai. As for whether he will return to his ancestral home in Fenghua, it is said that the decision will be made after arriving in Hangzhou. It is also learned that Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Nanjing will be at the earliest this afternoon, as Chiang is scheduled to give a speech to the Central Military Academy this morning.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Discusses Autumn Trip to Sichuan for Inspection, Establishment of the Construction Bank Corporation Decided for July 1st, China's Silver Import Surplus Not Necessarily Leading to Large-Scale Outflow</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, after convening a standing committee meeting in Beijing, returned to Shanghai by express train from Beijing at around 11:00 PM the night before. At 11:00 AM yesterday, at the NEC office on Rue Amiral de Ham, he met with reporters from various newspapers. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<h3>Autumn Trip to Sichuan</h3>
<p>Mr. Song first stated that his trip to Sichuan for inspection had been decided long ago, but it had to wait until after summer, when the weather cooled down in early autumn, before it could take place. Regarding the organization of the Construction Bank Corporation, it is scheduled to be officially established on July 1st. Internal staff have largely been internally determined. As for which work to start first after its establishment, it still requires detailed planning before it can be carried out.</p>
<h3>Rajchman's Return to China</h3>
<p>He then said that he had not yet received a telegram from Ludwik Rajchman, the League of Nations technical cooperation liaison to China, regarding when he would return to China. As for the secretary of NEC consultant Monnet, he had another part of his work to do and had to return to the United States. This time, his landing in Japan was purely a transit. It was not a special mission.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>Mr. Song continued to talk about the U.S. cotton and wheat loans. Everything will be in accordance with the amended contract, and it will be paid off within five years according to the contract. Among them, wheat and flour can also be returned in full from the fourth year.</p>
<h3>Raising Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Then, the reporter asked if the U.S. silver price increase bill had been approved, and whether China's silver would flow out in large quantities. Mr. Song then expressed his opinion, saying that he never believed that China would have a large outflow of silver due to the U.S. silver price increase. He is in contact with the financial community every day, and has not heard that they are very panicked about this. Chinese people often misunderstand that import and export surpluses directly affect the inflow and outflow of silver. In fact, an import surplus does not necessarily cause silver to flow out, because there is often a part of remittances from overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Bimetallic System</h3>
<p>When asked about the opinions of some bankers who advocate the implementation of a bimetallic system to use both gold and silver, Mr. Song replied that many countries have experimented with the implementation of bimetallicism in the past, and the results were not good. What will happen in the future is unpredictable, but China does not have gold. If we implement a bimetallic system, we must first buy cash, which is not necessary at present and is unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Gu Ambassador Returns Home</h3>
<p>Mr. Song finally said that Mr. Gu Shaochuan (Weijun), the Chinese ambassador to France, is returning to China on his own leave. The reason is that Mr. Gu has requested leave four or five times, and it has only been approved now. The expenses of the Chinese embassy in France are relatively high, and other embassies and consulates also have this difficulty. Finally, when asked about issues such as diplomacy, the opening of traffic and mail in North China, and Huang Shaoxiong's southward journey, Mr. Song replied that he did not know. He said that his trip to Beijing was purely for the discussion of the budget of the Economic Council, and he had not discussed these issues with President Wang and others, so he had nothing to say.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Strictly Prohibits Highly Toxic Drugs, Posts Slogans and Notices to Inform the Public, So as Not to Cause the Public to Accidentally Violate the Law</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command, after receiving the order from Chairman Chiang to strictly prohibit highly toxic drugs such as red pills and morphine, is deeply concerned that people from all walks of life are not yet fully aware, and it is pitiful that they may accidentally violate the law. Yesterday, it specially produced five kinds of large slogans and issued a notice, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>Regarding the notice, it has been found that highly toxic drugs such as red pills and morphine have been strictly prohibited by Chairman Chiang. I am now afraid that the people of this port are not yet fully aware and accidentally violate the law, which is very pitiful. I have specially made five kinds of slogans and posted them on the streets, so that every household knows and women and children know. If you dare to violate it again, you will be severely punished according to the law. This is the notice, Commander Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Slogans</h3>
<p>(1) Those who manufacture highly toxic drugs such as red pills and morphine will be shot. (2) Those who sell highly toxic drugs such as red pills and morphine will be shot. (3) Those who intend to make profits by injecting morphine needles for others or setting up places for people to smoke highly toxic drugs will be shot. (4) Those who transport highly toxic drugs such as red pills and morphine will be shot. (5) Those who smoke red pills or inject morphine needles, quit quickly. If you don't have money to hire a doctor, you can go to the Longhua Command to request free withdrawal.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Inspects Commissioned Patrol Ships</h3>
<p>In order to increase the police force on the river, the Hubei Civil Affairs Department specially commissioned the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy to build a total of eight patrol ships of various sizes. Since the start of construction, the project has been progressing extremely rapidly. The current Chairman of Hubei, Zhang Qun, took the opportunity to come to Shanghai on his way to Beijing to meet with Military Committee Chairman Chiang, and went to the shipyard in Gaochangmiao at 10:30 AM yesterday to inspect the construction of the eight patrol ships. The deputy director of the shipyard, Chen Zaofan, personally received him and led Mr. Zhang to the riverside to inspect the interior of the eight ships. He praised the excellent engineering of the patrol ships that were about to be completed, such as the Shuxing and Wenxing ships. He did not leave until 11:00 AM, and plans to continue building several ships for application after the completion of the patrol ships. The eight patrol ships built this time have been named Ren Ai, Zhong Xiao, and Nos. 1 to 6. In addition, the Anning, Anmin, and Anhua ships built by the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters will also be completed in the next few days.</p>
<h3>German Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Krieb, Speaks, Expressing That He Will Never Recognize the Puppet Manchukuo, German Overseas Chinese Hold Grand Banquet Last Night</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that Mr. Krieb, the new German Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and met with reporters to make a statement. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter specially recorded the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Recognize Puppet Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Regarding the previous rumors that Germany would recognize the Puppet Manchukuo, Mr. Krieb first replied to the reporter that regarding the so-called Manchukuo issue, although Germany has now withdrawn from the League of Nations, I firmly believe that Germany will take the same steps as the League of Nations. We will never recognize the Puppet Manchukuo, and we still have considerable obligations to the League of Nations, and there will never be a proposal to recognize the Puppet Manchukuo.</p>
<h3>Rejoining the League of Nations Issue</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Germany rejoining the League of Nations, according to Mr. Krieb, there is currently considerable possibility, but what the German government and people hope is that the League of Nations must respect Germany's opinions, and whether to join in the future will be a prerequisite. As for the recent rumors that Germany will implement an active policy towards China after my arrival in Shanghai, this statement is not true. I dare to assert that Germany is very concerned about the developing Far East issue, but there is no intention to take active action. Although Mr. Hitler is paying attention to the Far East, he is still devoting all his efforts to Europe.</p>
<h3>Trend of German-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>Mr. Krieb continued to talk about the trend of German-Russian relations improving, saying that the German government sincerely hopes to have friendly relations with Soviet Russia, but the current political organization of Soviet Russia is different from the German political system under Chancellor Hitler. At the same time, there are various other economic reasons that hinder German-Russian friendship. As for the issue of armaments, Germany has its own reasons and will not be willing to make the slightest concession. The political situation in Germany has improved compared to before, and the power of the Communist Party has gradually decreased.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Host Banquet for Mr. Krieb</h3>
<p>After Mr. Krieb arrived in Shanghai, he visited various major cultural institutions for several days. At 6:00 PM last night, all the overseas Chinese in Germany specially held a grand banquet at the German School at No. 1 Avenue Dubail to welcome Mr. Krieb.</p>

Six tickets were drawn, repaying principal of 180,000 yuan. Payment will be made by six banks, including the Central Bank, starting from the end of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>
<p>The representatives present included Qin Runqing of the Jiangzhe Silk Industry Short-Term Public Bonds Fund Custody Committee, Pan Zhongjia of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Lin Wanyuan of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Gao Jiyao of the Audit Department, Shen Huachen of the Silk Cocoon General Association, Jin Wenyuan of the Central Bank, Mao Shijian of the Bank of Communications, Pan Yongzhong of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Song Xunlun of the Zhejiang Local Bank, Jin Wenwei of the Wing Hang Bank, Yang Chengyi of the Jiangsu Bank, and Qin Xieqing of the Shanghai Money Industry Joint Reserve Bank, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Qin Runqing first reported that today is the date of the seventh repayment lottery for the Jiangzhe Silk Industry Short-Term Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 21. I am very pleased to have you all present to supervise and participate. The total amount of bonds issued is 3 million yuan, and it is stipulated that a lottery will be drawn every three months. In addition to the six lotteries that have already been drawn, this is the seventh lottery. All winning bonds will be redeemed for cash by six banks, including the Central Bank, China, Communications, Guohuo, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou Zhejiang Local Bank, starting from the 30th of this month. Please check the ticket branches and the ticket branch ledger to carry out the lottery.</p>
<h3>Winning Numbers</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the supervisors immediately checked the ticket branches and the ledger, and then carried out the lottery. A total of six tickets were drawn: "Number 09", "Number 19", "Number 29", "Number 33", "Number 88", "Number 98", totaling 180,000 yuan of principal to be repaid and 28,125 yuan of interest to be paid. All the drawn ticket branches were immediately submitted to the Chairman for inspection, and then handed over to the supervisors for verification. After confirming that there were no errors, the numbers were announced on the signboard, and the registration was done on the same day by the Fund Custody Committee in the newspaper for public knowledge.</p>
<h3>Spring Season This Year, Consolidated Tax Revenue Increases Sharply, Monthly Increases, Most in March, Currently Making Every Effort to Develop, Will Be Comparable to Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Since the collection of the consolidated tax on cigarettes in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department has successively handled the consolidated taxes on cotton yarn, wheat flour, matches, cement, flue-cured tobacco, and machine-made wine. In less than seven years, tax revenue has increased annually. A reporter from the New News Agency recently learned from the tax authorities that the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department is currently making every effort to develop the consolidated tax, and it is expected that it will soon be comparable to the salt tax. In the first quarter of this year, the national consolidated tax revenue increased in each month. It increased by more than 1.6 million yuan in January, more than 2 million yuan in February, and more than 2.7 million yuan in March. The reasons for the increase in revenue are approximately the following three points: (1) Tax increase: Starting from December 5th last year, the tax rates for cigarettes, matches, and cement were increased. Except for the small amount of matches and cement, the cigarette tax increased sharply after the tax increase. (2) The consolidated taxes of Hebei, Jin, Chahar, and Sui provinces were previously handled by the Hebei Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance. Except for the cigarette tax, which was paid to the national treasury, all were retained by the Hebei authorities for military and political expenses. Since the establishment of the Hebei, Jin, Chahar, and Sui Regional Bureau in November last year, all consolidated tax revenue has been paid to the treasury. The consolidated tax revenue has therefore increased. (3) The flue-cured tobacco produced in China is very large in Jinan, Bengbu, and Xuchang. In the past, the tax collection method was not perfect, and the amount collected was limited. Recently, it has been vigorously improved and is gradually on the right track, which is also a reason for the increase in tax revenue.</p>
<h3>After New Tea Goes on the Market, Export Sales Suddenly Boom, Green Tea Has Been Sold Out, Large Batch of Tea Bricks About to Be Shipped to Russia</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, since the new tea has been on the market recently, overseas trade has suddenly boomed. As a result, the tea market in foreign firms in this city is busy with business. More than 20 foreign firms in the city are importing as much as possible. The average daily intake is consistently between 7,000 and 10,000 boxes. At the same time, due to the sharp increase in demand, the selling price has increased for all brands. The situation in the tea market has gradually improved.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Sold Out</h3>
<p>Chinese tea is divided into three categories: black tea, green tea, and tea bricks. Foreigners prefer to buy black tea to quench their thirst due to different preferences. Although green tea has a very clear fragrance, there are very few drinkers. The situation in this year's tea market seems to be particularly different from last year. The Zhenmei and Zhenmei green teas from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian have been sold out. The foreign demand is very strong, which is really a new record in the tea industry.</p>
<h3>Tea Bricks Shipped to Russia</h3>
<p>The Russian Chamber of Commerce recently needs to purchase new tea for shipment to Russia for storage, so it specially sent a commissioner to Hankou and other places to purchase it last week. It is reported that it has collected more than 10,000 catties of old tea and 3,000 boxes of black tea, which will be shipped to Shanghai for storage in the near future and then shipped to the Soviet Union for sale.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Association Schedules Vehicle Inspection</h3>
<p>The Association Intends to Host People from All Walks of Life to Defend Against the Public Works Bureau's Explanation. Rickshaw Pullers Submit to the Public Works Bureau to Sponsor the Management Committee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association Special Zone Office believes that the Rickshaw Management Committee of the Public Works Bureau's proposals to reduce rickshaw fares and improve rickshaw styles are inappropriate. It has requested the Public Works Bureau to abolish the Management Committee to maintain the difficulties of the merchants. At the same time, it will defend against the explanation of the Management Committee. However, the rickshaw puller representatives expressed their support for the Public Works Bureau's handling. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Periodic Vehicle Inspection and Certificate Issuance</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Association Special Zone Office, dissatisfied with the new regulations and certificate issuance methods of the Rickshaw Management Committee of the Public Works Bureau, established a Registration Committee to conduct its own review and certificate issuance, and stipulated the daily review and certificate issuance period. When issuing certificates, the substitute donor must request proof of the substitute donation number, and then the committee will review and issue the certificate to ensure protection. No. 1 to No. 2000 will be issued from the 29th to July 1st, No. 2001 to No. 4000 will be issued from July 5th to 7th, No. 4001 to No. 5000 will be issued from July 8th to 10th, No. 5001 to No. 6000 will be issued from July 11th to 13th, No. 6001 to No. 7000 will be issued from July 14th to 16th, No. 7001 to No. 8000 will be issued from July 17th to 20th, No. 8001 to No. 9000 will be issued from July 21st to 23rd, and No. 9001 to No. 10000 will be issued from July 21st to 23rd.</p>
<h3>Defend Against Explanation and Host People from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Rickshaw Industry Association Special Zone Office told a reporter from the New News Agency that the Public Works Bureau Rickshaw Management Committee's proposed plans to improve rickshaw styles, help rickshaw pullers, and reduce rickshaw fares did not take into account the interests of the rickshaw owners themselves, and imposed a deadline for applying for certificates as a threat. It has requested the Public Works Bureau to abolish its proposals. As for the explanation of the Management Committee published in the newspaper today (yesterday) regarding various facilities, it is completely deceptive and confusing to disturb the public's hearing. The association is scheduled to convene the 34th board of directors meeting at 9:00 PM tonight (last night) to discuss and defend against it. At the same time, it will regularly host people from all walks of life to report the truth to avoid being deceived. The general meeting decided to send representatives to the Public Works Bureau to petition, and plans to go there after hosting people from all walks of life, and strive for the bureau to withdraw its decision to maintain the livelihood of the rickshaw owners.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Sponsor the Management Committee</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Bureau Information Office, the Public Works Bureau Rickshaw Management Committee recently announced its latest plan, that is, from August 1st of this year, the rickshaw fare will be reduced to 10 cents in small ocean coins, and from January 1st next year, it will be reduced to 8 cents in small ocean coins. In recent days, several rickshaw puller representatives have come to the management office to express their support and request the management office not to be deceived by the rickshaw owners' propaganda. One of the rickshaw puller representatives' submissions is excerpted as follows: The people suffer because a few old rickshaw merchants control the rickshaw business and arbitrarily increase the rickshaw fare to as much as 16 cents. The people work hard all day but find it difficult to get a full meal. The new regulations have been published in newspapers many times, and after that, the rickshaw fare shall not exceed 8 cents per day, which greatly benefits the poor. We are looking forward to its realization every day. Unexpectedly, recently, a few unscrupulous merchants have, in the name of the association, issued declarations, publicly slandering the government's policy of improving rickshaws and helping rickshaw pullers in order to deprive them of their attempts, and decided on three measures: (1) To not recognize the management office, (2) To still have the certificate issuance handled by a few people, not directly, (3) The rickshaw owners shall not freely advocate and must obey them. Tracing their intentions, it is nothing more than a conspiracy to control and monopolize. Improving rickshaws is not only beautiful in appearance, but also suitable for passengers. What are the drawbacks? As for applying for registration, it is to facilitate rickshaw owners to freely obtain certificates and avoid being bound by them.

<h3>The Municipal Government Approves the Joint Association of Machine Manufacturers and Explains Three Opinions Presented, The Difference Between the Electricity Prices of the Chinese and Rental Sides Is Not Much, Actively Constructing Roads Without Daring to Slacken, Harsh and Miscellaneous Names Should Be Clarified and Improved</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city, based on the Shanghai Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories requesting the revitalization of the market, the development of industry, and the elimination of harsh taxes and miscellaneous rules and various bad habits, requested verification and decision. Yesterday, it specially approved a reply to the association, explaining in detail the various points presented. The text said: It has been known from the presentation and should be ordered to the Social, Public Works, Public Utilities, and other bureaus,</p>
<h3>Jointly Handle</h3>
<p>After going, it is now reported by the bureau, etc., that after the meeting, the original presentation and transfer of various sections are not without misunderstandings and emptiness. The description is as follows: 1. Check the regulations on the operation of electrical business promulgated by the Construction Committee. The regulations are very detailed for the calibration of electric meters. This city also has regulations on the calibration of electric meters. If users believe that the electric meter is not accurate, they can request the company to calibrate it. In addition to requesting the company to calibrate the electric meter, they can request the Public Utilities Bureau to recalibrate it. The original presentation stated that an electric meter is inaccurate. This is actually very easy to clarify. The cost of electricity is determined by the size of the expenditure. Salaries account for only a small part of the total expenditure. Taking the two Chinese companies in Zhabei as an example, it is only about 8%. Furthermore, the power generation capacity of the two Chinese companies in Zhabei is about one-tenth of that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company. If the capacity is small, the equipment price per kilowatt and the amount of coal consumed per degree of power generation will increase accordingly. For example, Shanghai Electric Power Company generates electricity and consumes 17.534 BTU. The coal price per million BTU is 0.448 yuan, and Zhabei consumes 22.467 BTU, and the coal price is 0.54 yuan. All other consumption is the same. In fact, the electricity prices of the two Chinese companies in Zhabei are compared with each other in terms of costs, and there are highs and lows, with little difference. (Compared to slightly omitted) 2. The original presentation stated, "The rental boundary roads are built to the Chinese boundary, but the road construction in the Chinese boundary is delayed." Check that the Public Works Bureau has detailed plans for the road system in the city. Limited by funds, it cannot be fully realized. The urban area accounts for about 95.72% of the city, the Public Concession accounts for about 2.95%, and the French Concession accounts for about 1.3%. The road construction in the concession began very early. Before the 16th year of the Republic of China, the completed roads in the Public Concession reached 170.981 kilometers, and the French Concession reached 92.015 kilometers, while the urban area had only 177.05 kilometers. Since the establishment of the Public Works Bureau,</p>
<h3>Actively Build Roads</h3>
<p>Without daring to slacken, in the 21st year, the city had a total of 256.74 kilometers of roads, and the percentage of increase was the highest. However, because of limited funds, road construction was carried out in a shorter period of time and in a wider area, so the performance was not recognized by the general public. 3. Hu presented that the government should find ways to protect Chinese factories and shops and not allow any destructive actions and eliminate harsh taxes, miscellaneous rules and various bad habits." Regarding destructive taxes, taxes and bad habits, there are no specific examples, and it is difficult to review. Since the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, various rules for industry and commerce have been promulgated successively. In addition to handling them in accordance with the law, this Social Affairs Bureau has formulated separate regulations for this city for the convenience of execution and suppression, which have been reported to the government and recorded. As for</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Where it is unavoidable, the competent authority shall handle it according to law. The urban area and the concession have not been divided. Although the police power of the concession does not belong to us, all industrial and commercial administrations are handled by this Social Affairs Bureau, and there is no division. The boundary is handled together. As for supervision and suppression, the responsibility lies in not daring to let go of factory inspections, because the concession has not been able to proceed, and the urban area inspections are limited to the initial stage. Whether the donations and taxes are harsh and miscellaneous, there is no absolute standard. It seems that the names of the items should be listed and the advantages and disadvantages should be clarified, and then the relevant bureaus can have research on improvement or cancellation. If the bad habits are true, the details should be listed and presented for investigation and disposal. Before the order, the reasons are combined into a document to be submitted for approval. This approval</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Increase in Import Tax on Clocks to Protect Domestic Industry Development</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, regarding the matter of requesting a decision, that the chamber held its fifth member conference on June 17th. Based on a proposal from the Clock and Watch and Eyeglasses Guilds, requesting the imposition of an anti-dumping tax on imported clocks or an increase in import duties on clocks, it was stated that clocks are produced abroad, and those engaged in the clock and watch industry are merchants. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have understood that the way to save the country lies in promoting domestic goods. Enthusiastic members of the industry have invested in establishing clock factories, and their various clock products are sufficient to resist foreign goods and have long been praised by users. However, due to the impact of Japanese dumping, domestic production is at risk of being overwhelmed. According to investigations by clock factories, domestic clocks are currently sufficient to meet the needs of the Chinese people. It is proposed that the conference request the government to impose anti-dumping taxes or increase import duty rates on imported clocks. The benefits of this would be: firstly, to increase national treasury revenue; secondly, to promote domestic goods, achieving two benefits with one action, and so on. This was submitted to the conference for discussion, which recognized that domestic clocks in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Yantai have been manufactured in recent years to be sturdy and practical, not inferior to foreign products. The clocks produced in Tianjin were even displayed at the Railway Line Goods Exhibition, and the impression of domestic clocks has gradually spread throughout society. However, due to their relatively shallow roots, they cannot compete with foreign goods without state protection. The original proposal to impose anti-dumping taxes on imported clocks or increase import duties on clocks was resolved to be forwarded as a record. It is appropriate to record the case and submit a document requesting your ministry to review and approve its implementation for public benefit, etc.</p>
<h3>Records of the General Meeting of the Southern District Rice Merchants Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Southern District Rice Merchants Association convened the rice industry from various inland ports at the Yimiao Cuixiu Hall yesterday for the 16th Annual General Meeting. Representatives from various rice industries who attended the meeting included: Qingpu: Zhu Hongsun, Zhuang Fangsun, Xu Junqing, Feng Peiyu, Jiaoli: Lai Ziqi, Ye Shaoqiu, Shen Qiuru, Sijing: Shen Zhiyao, Chen Qiusheng, Fengjing: Xu Beichen, He Jicai, Zhujing: Shen Zhonglian, Luxu: Yin Jingzhai, Wujiang: Jin Zhen'an, Suzhou: Chen Junyu, Tongli: Chen Songtao, Xu Yusheng, Pang Bosheng, Beita: Zhang Xiting, Zhang Guorong, Liantang: Zhu Xinhan, Shengze: Yang Lianqing, Cheng Yikuan, Pingwang: Lü Shaoyun, Gu Zhenzhong, Hengtang: Min Shaofu, Xitang: Min Yinqiao, Shen Chunlin, Pinghu: Zhang Pinghou, Cuanlai Temple: Zhuang Jieshen, Xindai: Lu Wenshan, Ji Weixian, Shanghai: Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Zixiang, Shen Shangwen, Huang Shengyuan, Tong Fuhai, Zhu Qiu xiong, Li Shuiquan, Yang Yongyuan, Yan Jiyun, and 67 other representatives, along with more than 160 rice merchants. The meeting was called to order at 2 PM with a bell, chaired by Yan Xiaoquan, recorded by Wang Disheng, and conducted with proper formalities. The chairman reported on the approximate income and expenditure accounts for the twelfth year. Immediately following that, it was reported that letters had been received from the rice industry associations in Qingpu, Pinghu, Wujiang, Jiashan, Sijing, Jiaoli, and other ports, proposing matters concerning Shanghai rice firm commissions and pier donations. A letter had been forwarded to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association to question the logic, and the association's reply was read out. It was requested that the proposals be discussed. (1) Commission Case: The original commission was set at 20 cents per picul, and now it has increased by 2 cents. For us inland merchants, everything is included in the commission. Why is the Shanghai rice firm different? Therefore, the increased 2 cents should be deducted. The chairman then presented his opinion that the Shanghai rice firm commission, after being approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, is indeed only 20 cents. As for the increased 2 cents, the Bean and Rice Industry Association has explained clearly that it is the wage for porters and carriers, not for measures or wine. If you insist on deducting it, I am afraid that it will cause labor disputes. Please pay attention. After public discussion, it was decided to retain it. (2) Pier Donation Case: Pier donations are still being collected now, but the Bean and Rice Industry Association's account is not announced, so that payers know the details. It was resolved to send a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, requesting that they promptly announce the account for the one cent pier fee paid before the end of June in detail, so that the northern city would be answered fully and donations would be stopped unanimously. (3) Sales Commission Case: The sales commission for rice in the northern city is 5 cents per picul, which the cargo owner is willing to pay. Qingpu traders must reduce the sales commission in southern Shanghai to the same treatment, and there should be no discrimination. It was resolved that the sales commission should be based on equality. Another meeting of merchants should be convened to reply to traders in various ports based on the circumstances. (4) A letter was received from various boatmen transporting rice, requesting leniency in the unloading order. It was resolved to reply to the boatmen and other parties to discuss with the cargo owner nearby, and the meeting adjourned. It was already 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Polish Embassy Commemorates Deceased Interior Minister</h3>
<p>The Polish Embassy in China, in memory of the late Polish Minister of Interior, Mr. Pieracki, held a memorial ceremony at 9 AM on the 23rd at the Saint Joseph's Church on Rue du Chevreuil in the French Concession.

<h3>British and American Strike Committee Informed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dagongshe states that the British and American labor strikes have been deadlocked for over a month, making it difficult to resolve. Workers' livelihoods are in extreme panic. Yesterday, a letter was sent to Du Yuesheng and others, requesting them to find a way to provide relief. The Strike Committee also issued three declarations, requesting all sectors to uniformly reject British and American products to promote an early resolution of the dispute.</p>
<h3>Women's National Goods Annual Meeting Sends Representatives to Inspect Factories Yesterday, Requests Chamber of Commerce to Order Labeling of Domestic Products</h3>
<p>The Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee inspected major factories in the city yesterday and sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it order all industries to uniformly label products with factory names and trademarks. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection</h3>
<p>The association believes that promoting domestic goods should not be empty talk. The general intellectual class has a deep understanding of domestic goods, but many people cannot distinguish them. Therefore, it organized an inspection team in the first half of the year to investigate industries in North China and visit major factories. Yesterday at 2 PM, the association sent Tang Guanyu, Lin Kecong, Huang Yangpei, Cai Zhoujun, Zhu Wang Wanqing, Xue Wei Zengpei, Li Manyun, Sun Daosheng, Wang Hanqiang, Ni Baiyan, Zhou Xixin, Fei Xia, and ten other representatives to visit Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Tianchu Ajinomoto Factory, China Enamel Factory, and Meiya Silk Weaving Factory. Managers Xu Yangnan, Wu Yun Chu, Fang Jiange, and Cai Sheng Bai respectively provided hospitality. They returned to the association at 5 PM. The association decided to introduce the products of various factories to the community to achieve practical results in promotion.</p>
<h3>Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The original letter reads: To the esteemed Chamber, our association is newly established, and everything is waiting to be done. We are actively promoting domestic goods and spare no effort, hoping to fulfill the mission of the Women's National Goods Year. However, social customs often favor the purchase of foreign goods, so the promotion has yielded little results in half a year. Our capabilities are weak, and we are ashamed to say so. Recently, our association held a joint meeting of the Design, Economic, and Work Committees to discuss methods to continue promoting domestic goods for better implementation. It was unanimously agreed that domestic goods vendors and consumers must have a spirit of comprehensive cooperation in order to achieve practical results in promoting domestic goods. Household necessities are often filled with foreign goods, and it is difficult to identify the markings of domestic goods producers. As a result, once purchased, there is a risk of mistakenly purchasing inferior goods. It is requested that major companies uniformly label all kinds of domestic goods with the manufacturing factory and trademark, so that customers can easily identify them. In this atmosphere of enthusiastic promotion of domestic goods in the women's community, they will surely be happy to purchase domestic goods and avoid the drawbacks of mistakenly purchasing foreign goods. After discussion, it was decided to record the case and send a letter to your esteemed Chamber, requesting that you forward this instruction to all affiliated domestic goods companies, factories, and stores, and promptly implement it. Therefore, we send this letter with the resolution, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, as it is our sincere hope.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan Travels to Hunan and Hubei to Expand the Domestic Goods Market in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of China Yabaoer Electrical Appliance Factory, traveled to Hankou ten days ago to open up the domestic goods market in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and met with Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and Hubei Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun to request their support for the plan to open up the domestic goods market. It is reported that Mr. Hu has recently traveled from Hankou to Hunan to visit Hunan Provincial Chairman He Jian and also inspected the electrical business in Hunan Province. According to the person in charge of the Yabaoer Factory, Mr. Hu is expected to return to Shanghai around the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Health Office to be Established on the First of Next Month</h3>

<h3>Letter from Ma Shaoquan, Executive Committee Member of the City Chamber of Commerce, to the Wuxi Fellow Association for Assistance to Wang Yingchun, the Bomb has been Rendered Harmless and Should Not Be Considered a Crime, and Young People with Potential Should Not Be Oppressed</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She states that Wang Yingchun, a young man from Wuxi and an employee of the New-New Company, was found to have a bomb during a dormitory search after a theft at the company. The police prosecuted him for endangering public safety under Article No. XXXX. Ma Shaoquan, the executive committee member of the City Chamber of Commerce and leader of the Wuxi community in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Wuxi Fellow Association out of fellow feeling, requesting assistance. The original letter reads: To the esteemed association, recently, I read in the evening newspaper that a young fellow villager, Wang Yingchun, was searched at the New-New Company after a theft and found to possess a bomb that had been rendered harmless and kept as a souvenir. The police are prosecuting him in the First Special District Court under Article No. XXXX, endangering public safety, etc. I have reviewed Wang's past. He is a young man with admirable ambition. The souvenir bomb has been rendered non-explosive. In all fairness, it should not be considered a crime. Furthermore, according to the police lawyer, Wang returned to the New-New Company after serving in the military and his conduct is good. Therefore, the law should be lenient. The New-New Company's search for stolen items and the discovery of the bomb are two completely separate matters. It seems inappropriate to destroy his potential and oppress him, depriving him of his freedom. Our association is a fellow villager. Young people with potential should be assisted. The bomb that has been rendered harmless should be quickly handed over to the police for safekeeping to prove its harmlessness. Therefore, I am sending this letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it. Yours sincerely, to the Wuxi Fellow Association.</p>
<h3>Rescuing Three Navigation Vessels</h3>
<p>Italian Postal Ship Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Da Lai Company</p>
<h3>Towing the Italian Ship</h3>
<p>The Italian Postal Ship Company's freighter, the "Colt Le Treina", left Italy on the 15th of last month bound for Shanghai. Near Haiphong, Vietnam, it suddenly ran aground, delaying its arrival in Shanghai. It was reported in this newspaper. At the end of last month, it departed from Shanghai, first to various ports in Japan to load cargo, then to Hong Kong to return to Italy. On the 20th of this month, the ship was sailing about 100 nautical miles from Hong Kong, in the waters of Dongsha Island, when it ran aground on a shoal due to fog. The shipowner initially planned to sail out on his own, but because the hull was aground, he could not move. He telegraphed the Hong Kong and Shanghai companies for help. The Shanghai company received the report and telegraphed the freighter "Hihda" on its way to Shanghai to send goods. After leaving Singapore, it went directly to the location to tow the "Colt Le Treina" out of the shoal. It is expected that this will happen in the next day or two. The "Colt Le Treina" is purely a freighter and does not carry passengers and is not a regular scheduled ship, so the impact is light. However, the "Bult" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th, but this mission will require extending the date of arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jian Guo Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ship, the "Jian Guo", was grounded in Tianjia Zhen on the 20th due to a broken rudder. The report stated before. The bureau later received a telegram from Jiujiang and a report from the "Jian Guo" shipowner, Wang Youshi, stating that after the "Jiang Shun" arrived, it used a wire cable to secure the "Jian Guo" and tried its best to tow it during the high tide. Fortunately, the Yangtze River was flooding, so once it was towed, it was pulled from the shoal. The cargo and passengers on the "Jian Guo" were spared the procedure of unloading and boarding the "Jiang Shun". However, because the rudder chain was broken and could not be steered, it was towed to Hankou by the "Wang Shun". The cargo is being unloaded and the rudder chain is being repaired. Today, it can be launched in Hankou and is scheduled to start operating in Shanghai on the 27th as usual.</p>
<h3>Lincoln Goes to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Dollar Steamship Line's "President Lincoln" caught fire in the Pacific, damaging the seventh cabin. Because it was a regular scheduled ship, it still arrived in Shanghai on the originally scheduled date. The burned and damaged goods in the seventh cabin have been unloaded at the White Lotus Wharf and are being inspected and counted. The ship manifest is being inspected every day and is very busy. Three cabins in the passenger area were damaged by water sprayed during firefighting and must also be repaired. Due to the time constraints, the ship departed from Shanghai at 2 PM yesterday and sailed to Hong Kong and the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Southern District Rent Reduction Association Sends Letter to Property Owners Association Members, Hoping They Will Not Make Litigation a Means to an End</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Southern District Rent Reduction Association held a meeting yesterday at the association's hall in Yongqingli, MinGuo Road, and resolved that, given the current situation of lawsuits filling the courts and disturbing society, the association solemnly declares that it will not participate in or hear any illegal actions of the spring bank if they do not act according to law to reduce rents. For those who have requested rent reductions to landlords, all rents must be deposited in the bank before a solution is reached and cannot be withdrawn at will. A request has also been submitted to the court. If there are any questions, please inquire at the association. The original letter to the Property Owners Association is recorded below. To the esteemed association, given the current economic situation and the decline of all of Shanghai, the call for rent reduction cannot be stopped. Please ask your members to consider the merchants' difficulties and, before the rent reduction negotiation is resolved, please ensure that those who have a bank deposit book with the association's seal proving that the rent has been deposited do not use rent arrears as an excuse to initiate lawsuits, so as to maintain feelings and support each other. If funds are needed, some can be withdrawn first, and then a solution can be sought. If lawsuits are initiated, the instigator will be fully responsible for the resulting losses. Please do not make litigation a means to an end and disturb society. We hope that you will carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages. We have long admired your association's ability to balance property and regulate finance, and we are confident that you can help the city's economy and seek a joint recovery. We hope that our humble suggestions will be adopted. Yours sincerely.</p>

<h3>Cai Yangqi Case Reopened Yesterday, Lang Zuyin Still Refuses to Appear, Cai Yangqi Was Sent to the Zhenyi Research Institute for Examination Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cai Yangqi, a worker at the Long Shun Gongdi cargo shop on Fujian Road, was suspected of being involved in a robbery at the shop. The shop owner, Bao Defu, reported to the police, who arrested Cai and sent him to the First Special District Local Court. After finding him innocent, the court released Cai. After Cai returned home, his wife, Cai Fan, claimed that he suddenly suffered from coughing and other symptoms, which were caused by the investigator Lang Zuyin torturing him during his detention. She then filed a lawsuit against Bao and Lang for assault. Lang Zuyin repeatedly failed to appear in court. The court authorities believed that Lang's refusal to appear should be the responsibility of the police. Chief Judge Guo has lodged a serious protest with the police twice based on the agreement, urging them to order Lang to surrender and await interrogation. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard again, and Lang Zuyin still did not appear. However, Cai Yangqi was able to walk to court himself and sat in the waiting seat.</p>
<p>Bao Defu and others stood separately in the plaintiff and defendant positions. He was instructed, "What is the extent of Cai Yangqi's illness? This court believes that there is still a need for re-examination. Therefore, this case is still adjourned, and the bailiff is ordered to send Cai to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination. A subpoena will be issued to Lang Zuyin again as well." A bailiff then took a document and ordered Cai to leave the court and go to Zhenru.</p>

Zhang said he was not there, and he himself</p>

<h3>Monument to Fallen Police Officers Scheduled for Unveiling Ceremony; Director Wen Invites All Circles to Attend</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to commend the police officers who have died in the line of duty in the past, and to provide an example for future generations to admire, has specially built a stone monument at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Hongxing Road in Zhabei to commemorate them forever. The entire project has been completed and will be unveiled at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month. Director Wen Hongen yesterday sent invitations to various agencies and organizations in the city, inviting them to send representatives to attend the ceremony at that time. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Appearance of the Monument</h3>
<p>The Monument to Fallen Police Officers of Past Years is located at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Hongxing Road in Zhabei and was designed by architect Fan Wenzhao. It covers an area of about a quarter of an acre and is triangular in shape. A stone monument is built in the center, with a height of more than two zhang. From the base to the top, it is all made of white stone. The center of the monument is engraved with "Monument to Fallen Police Officers of Shanghai in Past Years."

<h3>Scenes of Inland China Captured by Foreign Cameras; Mr. Meisai of America Talks with Western Newspaper Reporter</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that Mr. Meisai of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, of America, has made a film based on the novel "The Good Earth" by American female writer Pearl Buck, and has taken local scenes in inland China. He has spent five months here and yesterday (22nd) took a boat back to America. Afterwards he plans to complete the film. He told the "North China Daily News" reporter that he was very grateful for the various assistance given by the Nanjing government and the Nanjing Film Censorship Bureau. His work is indeed pioneering. Taking location shots in China by a foreign film company is unprecedented. He believes that once the mountains and forests are opened, other foreign companies will follow suit. He is sure that his company will make new films in China in the near future. He had photographed all the way from Shanghai to Beiping and as far as Shanhaiguan. It was supposed to take seven weeks to complete the work, but it has been extended to five months. The company had sent 15 artists to travel with him and hired personnel as needed in various locations. The cost of the film far exceeded expectations, but the cost was well worth it. After arriving in the United States, it will take five or six months to complete the entire film. All the films taken were produced in Shanghai and shown to the Nanjing Film Censorship Bureau before going to the United States. Very few were deleted.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei also told a reporter from the "Continental Daily News" that there was a representative of the Nanjing government at the scene when filming along the way. In the future, when making interior scenes in Hollywood, there will also be a representative of the Nanjing government. After the entire film is completed, it will be sent to Nanjing for approval. Most of the films taken have not yet been made, and those that have been made are very satisfactory after being shown.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Cao Lin Accused of Inducing and Abandoning a Woman; An Encounter in the Park Turns into Intimacy; After Becoming Pregnant, He Treats Her Like a Stranger</h3>
<p>Lawyer Cao Lin is accused of inducing Wang Meiying, a woman under the age of 20, into illicit relations, and after she became pregnant, abandoning her. His friend, Shan Xingwu, joins in the wickedness and treats her worse than a stranger. Wang Song, the woman's mother, has retained a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Cao and Shan for harming public morals and to have the two defendants punished according to law. A record of the beginning and end of this case is as follows: Wang Meiying is Wang Song's own daughter, 20 years old this year. In June of last year, Meiying, because it was a Sunday and it was very hot, went to the</p>
<h3>Zhaofeng Garden</h3>
<p>to cool off at 4:00 or 5:00 PM, when the sun was setting. The child fell to the ground while playing in the circle. Cao Lin happened to be passing by and helped the child up, and Meiying thanked him and they started talking. They exchanged names. Cao said that he had opened the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road and invited Meiying to go to the Great Light Cinema the next day. Meiying saw that he was sincere and enthusiastic and readily agreed. After watching the movie, Meiying asked about employment opportunities. Cao immediately agreed to introduce her to work at the Women's Trust Company, saying that she could earn 40 or 50 yuan a month. Meiying was overjoyed, and from then on,</p>
<h3>Their Relationship Grew Closer</h3>
<p>They often went to the movies together. A month later, Cao invited Meiying to the Hongkou Hotel and opened a room on the fifth floor to</p>
<p>chat. Unexpectedly, Cao suddenly closed the door tightly and demanded to sleep with her. Meiying, believing she was still a virgin, did not want to defile herself and firmly refused. Cao Lin's desire was very strong, and he falsely claimed that his wife had died and that if she agreed, he would marry her as his successor. Meiying thought that even if she became a lawyer's wife after being raped, it would not matter, so she agreed to the pillow and mat to fulfill Cao's wish. Afterwards, Cao said that the Women's Trust Company he recommended was not yet open, so he introduced Meiying to learn dancing at the Da Hu</p>
<h3>Dance School</h3>
<p>and paid the tuition fee of 15 yuan. Cao also joined the school, ostensibly to learn to dance, but in reality to take the opportunity to meet Meiying day and night so that their love would become more intense. From then on, the Dongfang, Yangzi, and Pingqiao hotels became their meeting places. Before long, Meiying became pregnant and repeatedly urged Cao to quickly carry out the marriage ceremony to avoid the possibility of having a child without a father in the future. However, Cao was evasive. Meiying was afraid that her mother would find out and planned to tell her the truth first, but Cao stopped her again, saying that he</p>
<h3>Was a Lawyer</h3>
<p>and that once it was publicized, it would affect his reputation. He told Meiying to lie to her mother that she had joined the Women's Trust Company and was staying at the company because she was busy, so even though she was pregnant, her mother would not know. Meiying, because what was done could not be undone, could only let him do as he pleased. Cao then ordered his friend, Zhan Xingwu, to rent a back room on the upper floor of 127 Shanhai Pass Road for her to live in. Last month, Meiying's maternal grandfather died, and her mother wanted her to go to the funeral, so she asked someone to call her at the Women's Trust Company. A secret was revealed at this time, but she still did not know where Meiying was. Wang [surname missing]</p>
<h3>Searched Everywhere</h3>
<p>But Meiying also realized that it would be difficult to hide for long, so she went home and confessed. Unexpectedly, Cao suddenly became malicious, not only stopped providing living expenses, but also instigated a Li [surname missing] who was working at the China Merchants Bureau to suddenly go to her house when Meiying was at home and press her abdomen hard with both hands, obviously with intent. Meiying shouted for help, and the police arrested Li and took him to the Xinzha Police Station. After a doctor verified that the fetus had not been affected, Li was released. At that time, the police chief did not investigate because Cao claimed that he and Meiying were husband and wife and only told them that if there were any disputes,</p>
<h3>They Should File a Complaint in Court</h3>
<p>Therefore, the mother and daughter have now retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, saying that Cao Lin, as a lawyer, knew the law, but he induced a young girl, used fraudulent means, and committed continuous adultery. After she became pregnant, he abandoned her, committing crimes under Articles 244 and 257 of the Criminal Law. Shan Xingwu helped him to do evil and also committed the above crimes and asked that he be severely punished. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui summoned them for trial. The plaintiff gave birth at Guangren Hospital at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and could not appear in court. The defendant Cao Lin also did not appear in court and retained a lawyer to file a defense, stating that the allegations were false and intended to extort money. The court adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of June 30 because both parties had not appeared in court.</p>
<h3>簡照南妾 訴養女案訊結 定二十七日宣判</h3>
<p>The case of Jian Liang Jingfen, the concubine of the deceased Jian Zhaonan, shareholder of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, suing her adopted daughter Jian Zhenyi, who left without saying goodbye on March 11th of this year, and repeatedly refused to return, considering the relationship severed, immediately hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the First Special Court requesting adoption termination. The court, considering Jian Zhenyi's minority status, legally appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping as a special agent. After three summons by the court, Jian Zhenyi argued that the reason for leaving was that Jian Liang had an affair with the venerable Ben Ji of Baohua Mountain. Recently, Ben Ji repeatedly attempted to violate her chastity and committed various unspeakable acts against her, forcing her to leave. She also filed a counterclaim, demanding that Jian Liang pay education, upbringing, and marriage expenses of 30,000 yuan each. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Peng Shi of the court continued the hearing. Lawyer Jiang Yiping was unable to attend due to other commitments and delegated lawyer Wu Baotai as his representative. Lawyer Wu stated that a settlement was absolutely impossible. The court then ordered the commencement of arguments. Lawyer He, representing the plaintiff, stated that the defendant, after being raised and educated by the plaintiff for eighteen years, left without saying goodbye and made various insults to the plaintiff. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 1081 and 1086 of the Civil Code, he requested a judgment terminating the adoption. Furthermore, the defendant's claim that her upbringing expenses were included in the 60,000 yuan received by the plaintiff was completely wrong. This 60,000 yuan was a one-time living expense paid by Pan, the legal wife of Jian Zhaonan. Therefore, he requested that her suit be dismissed. Lawyer Wu argued that the reason for the defendant's departure had been explained, and the defendant's suffering should be understood. The plaintiff claimed that she had repeatedly tried to get the defendant back, but in reality, she could not return. The defendant had previously stated that she could return home as long as Ben Ji did not come, but the plaintiff could not accept this condition. How could she favor a monk over her adopted daughter? Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed and that if the adoption was terminated, the defendant's economic situation would be in dire straits. According to Article 1082 of the Civil Code, she should be given a considerable sum of money. Furthermore, the defendant had a right to the 60,000 yuan, and he requested a judgment for 30,000 yuan. The court then ordered the conclusion of the arguments and set the judgment date for the 27th.</p>
<h3>蘇州河沿岸 住船貧民起鬨 擊沉代表船屋三艘 認警局佈告係僞造</h3>
<p>Along the Suzhou River, from Chadaijiao in the west to the New Garbage Bridge in the east, bordered by the Public Concession to the south and Zhabei Chinese area to the north, since last spring, the Dredging Bureau believed that the boat dwellings of the poor on both sides of the river hindered their work. Therefore, they petitioned the Municipal Government to find a way to expel them. Later, the Municipal Government, considering that these poor people were ignorant and unreasonable, allowed them to continue living there. However, the elements among these poor people were complex, and a radical solution had to be used. Only the original residents were allowed to decrease, and no new residents were allowed to increase. Seven measures were established, and representatives Jiang Weiqing, Zhou Bokai, Li Ruizhen, Shang Longyou, Tang Cunjie, Jiang Deyu, Zhao Ruyi, Li Guifu, Li Youfa, Ni Jingui, Liang Rengui, Zhou Chongshan, and Sun Yougui were selected from among these poor people to be responsible for investigation and registration. Unexpectedly, this had not been implemented until this year. The Municipal Government then ordered the Public Security Bureau to instruct Xu Chizhi, Inspector of the Second Water Patrol Team, to carry out the registration and issued a notice. This caused a major uproar. For some unknown reason, these poor people, around 10 p.m. the night before, gathered a crowd of five to six hundred men, women, old, and young, and rushed to the boat dwellings of the representatives, hitting anyone they encountered without asking why. The representatives, seeing the unfavorable situation, led their families to escape. As a result, one boat dwelling each of Shang Longyou at the entrance of Xingyi Lane on Guangfu Road, Shen Jiazhong at the entrance of Yuanshun Timber Company, were sunk and completely destroyed. The boats of Chen Jinsheng and Cheng Haiquan were also damaged. The boat dwelling of Li Ruizhen on the riverbank of Yong'an Cotton Mill in the concession area was also completely destroyed. It is now known that these representatives have submitted petitions to the Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau, seeking relief. According to these poor people, the representatives forged a notice from the Public Security Bureau to sow discord, so they had to put the representatives to death. Their ignorance is both ridiculous and pitiful.</p>
<h3>徐家宅路 盜匪越貨殺人 蔡李氏盛裝賈禍 呼救中槍竟枉死</h3>
<p>At No. 58 Xujiazhai Road, Zhabei, Jiangbei native Cai Yutian and his wife Cai Li lived in a thatched hut. The couple was able to be diligent and thrifty, so they had some savings. However, the woman dressed in elaborate clothing to flaunt her wealth. Around 8 p.m. the night before, Cai was already asleep when the woman, wearing gold bracelets and rings, went out to soak her feet. On her way home, three robbers, seeing her wealth, were tempted and followed her home. When the woman returned home, the robbers also entered and robbed her by force. When the woman shouted for help, the robbers opened fire, shooting her once in the left breast, causing her to fall to the ground immediately. They robbed her of two gold rings and fled. Cai, hearing the noise in the room, rushed out and saw that his wife had been shot and killed. He mourned loudly over her body and reported the incident to the Fourth District Police Station, which sent police to investigate but without success. Yesterday, the local bailiff, Lu Abaobao, was ordered to report the case to the local court. Prosecutor Wu and others were commissioned to the scene to examine the body and confirmed that she died from a gunshot wound. They ordered the family to collect the body and wait for the arrest of the murderer and investigation of the case.</p>

<h3>來函</h3>
<p>To the Editor, After reading the article in your newspaper on the 18th of this month about the large-scale shipment of Japanese straw hats to Shanghai for dumping, I was shocked. It is found that there are about seventy or eighty straw hat manufacturers in Shanghai, both large and small. The larger ones include Huafu, Huanqiu, Huaxing, FulI, Guanyi, Fuyuan, Huang Shaoji, Cao Chengji, and Dong Huasheng, among others, all of which are members of our association. They completely use domestic raw materials to manufacture straw hats and promote them throughout the country. As for Japanese straw hats, they have almost completely disappeared in recent years. Our colleagues have not promoted them on their behalf. As for the annual output of more than 50,000 dozen, it is also inconsistent with the original number of manufacturers. Among them, Shanghai, Zhonghua, and Yongli are not members of our association, so we cannot prove it for them. At this time of advocating domestic goods, I am afraid that the people of the country do not understand the truth, which hinders the sales of domestic goods. For this reason, I am sending this letter to your newspaper, please publish it in the letter column so that the people of the country can understand. This is to the person in charge of Shen Bao, the Shanghai Straw and Felt Hat Industry Association, June 23.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>動物有沒有本能？（一）</h3>
<p>Do animals have instincts? (1)</p>
<p>丨丨 Reply to Mr. Wang Deming</p>
<p>After reading Guo Renyuan's "Common Basis of Behavioral Science", Mr. Wang had great doubts about the behaviorists' denial of "instinct" and "consciousness". Mr. Wang believes that "people have instincts" and at the same time Mr. Wang also "respects instinct theory." Who is right and who is wrong? Mr. Wang himself cannot decide, so he asks us. We feel that the question raised, although it is inevitably too specialized, but the theory of "instinct" has a deep impression on the general public, and we believe that it is not meaningless to take this opportunity to discuss it once! Before explaining human "instincts", we should discuss animal instincts, so we have slightly expanded the question. Now let's briefly discuss methodology.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted by psychologists that animals have instincts, but behavioral psychologists uniquely object to it, especially Mr. Guo Renyuan is the most thorough. Will instinct really lose its meaning of existence due to the opposition of behaviorists? This is a very worthy question to discuss. But if you want to get a satisfactory solution from the research and theories of various schools of psychology today, it is very difficult, because each school has its own source of standpoint and method, and each school adheres to its own right and opposes others' wrongs. The conclusions reached are often one-sided.</p>
<p>We naturally cannot deny that each school of psychologists has made its special contributions to psychology, but at the same time, their one-sided, metaphysical methodology prevents them from grasping the overall situation of things, leading the conclusions to extremely dangerous aspects. Behaviorism has also provided many valuable studies, and at the same time, because of the special methods of behaviorism, it has reached very strange conclusions, namely the denial of instinct.</p>
<p>Therefore, to answer the question of whether there are instincts after all, it is best to first make a critique of the methods of behaviorism and point out what is the correct research method. Grasping the correct method, readers can make correct judgments in the research, and will not be at a loss when they see a strange conclusion.</p>
<p>The value of behaviorism lies in the fact that it applies materialistic, thorough experimental methods in psychology. In the hands of behaviorists, psychology has become a completely objective experimental science. It also regards psychological phenomena as a kind of material phenomenon, and as a process of a series of stimuli and responses. Therefore, behaviorists believe that the research of psychological science should be to apply material stimuli to seek the material response behavior on animals. The research of stimuli and responses is the fundamental basis of psychological science. Behaviorists abandoned the subjective observation method of introspectionists and treated the mind as the same thing as physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>Linking psychological phenomena with physics and chemistry is a great achievement of behaviorism, because higher-level (psychological) phenomena cannot be separated from lower-level material foundations. Psychological action is only an attribute of material action. When matter does not exist, there is no mind. Obtaining an understanding of the mind from the study of matter is a great advantage of behaviorism. However, once behaviorism grasps the material foundation, it thinks that this low-level foundation is already sufficient to represent everything, so it denies the particularity of the entire psychological action, thinking that there is nothing more than the process of stimulation and response. Instinct, consciousness, can be reduced to the phenomenon of stimulation and response, and it itself has no meaning at all.</p>
<p>Based on this methodology, behaviorists deny the existence of instinct and regard instinct as one of the processes of stimulation and response. This methodology is what we often hear called "mechanistic methodology." Reducing higher-level phenomena to lower-level phenomena and obliterating the special significance of higher-level phenomena. More clearly, mechanists believe that higher-level phenomena and lower-level phenomena only have differences in complexity and simplicity, but no difference in nature, that is, only quantitative differences, but no qualitative differences. Therefore, it is believed that instinct and the process of stimulation and response are the same thing, but stimulation and response are only simple stimulation and response, and instinct is only a series of complex stimulations and responses.</p>
<p>This methodology is also metaphysical. Why is it metaphysical? It is that it grasps one side of things and forgets the other side of things. It regards the side it grasps as dead and fixed, and does not know the activity of this side, does not know that it can be transformed into the other side. Acknowledging the low-level phenomena of stimulation and response, and abandoning the high-level phenomena such as instinct and consciousness, this is metaphysics.</p>
<p>But the metaphysical method has long ceased to be a method of studying truth today. To give a simple example, water is more advanced than hydrogen and oxygen, because water is a compound formed by the combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but can we say that the properties of water are the same as those of hydrogen and oxygen? Naturally, to study the composition of water, it must be decomposed into these two gases, but the understanding of the nature of water itself can never be obtained in the study of the two gases, but the whole water must be taken for research. We cannot deny the special nature of advanced water because we analyze out low-level hydrogen and oxygen. When low-level phenomena are compounded into high-level phenomena, it is not only a quantitative change, that is, not only a quantitative complexity, but also a change in nature, and it is transformed into another kind of quality.</p>
<p>Therefore, studying high-level phenomena with the analysis of low-level phenomena as the foundation is something that can be agreed with, because high-level phenomena are composed of low-level phenomena, and high-level phenomena contain all low-level phenomena. But once a high-level phenomenon is formed, the properties of the low-level phenomenon disappear and become another kind of property. This process of transformation is what is called sublation (Aufheben). In this way, for behaviorists, we can greatly admire their materialistic, objective, experimental research methods, but because of the application of this method, we must deny the instinct and consciousness of animals. That is the work of the metaphysical method. If we break the shackles of the metaphysical viewpoint, we can admit the existence of instinct, at least there is no need to deny it. Because instinct is a more advanced phenomenon than simple stimulation and response, although it is also composed of a series of stimuli and responses, but since it has become a series, the nature is not just a stimulation response. For example, a simple stimulus response is only a mechanical, blind behavior, while instinct is a purposeful behavior that stubbornly moves around a central purpose. Since instinct's purposeful behavior is different from mechanical blind behavior, the special meaning of instinct can be established, and the existence of instinct cannot be denied.

In the semifinals, they unexpectedly defeated the well-known Karlsen and Pan Lifefei three to one. Wang and Yu's ball momentum is extremely stable and their serves are as fast as bullets. The two sides fought intensely, causing Karlsen and Pan to be unable to grasp the situation and could only parry without counterattacking. Under Wang and Yu's vigorous attack, they were defeated miserably. Wang and Yu won the finals and will face Xu Chengji and Defu in the finals.</p>

<h3>Mixed Doubles Semifinals: Qiu Feihai's Team Eliminated, Loses to Ke Erqiao's Team 1-2</h3>
<p>The mixed doubles competition of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club was held yesterday at the French Chamber of Commerce, with Qiu Feihai and Madame Medemo facing Ke Erqiao and Madame Tui Lou in the semifinals. As a result, the Qiu-Mei team lost 1-2 and was eliminated. The Ke-La Sha siblings against Bu De and Mrs. Ni Gushi will be held today.</p>
<p>Ke Erqiao &amp; Mrs. Tui Lou beat Qiu Feihai &amp; Madame Medemo four to six, six to four, six to one.</p>
<h3>Technical Decline</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai's technique is noticeably declining. His shots are soft and lack power, and his net play cannot overcome the opponent's desperate situations. Madame Medemo was initially good and coped with ease, but later she became completely useless, hitting the net with every shot. It was quite difficult for the two to win the first set, as Qiu's performance was affected by Madame Medemo's poor showing.</p>
<h3>Excellent Net Play</h3>
<p>The opponent, Madame Tui Lou, is slender, in stark contrast to the large Madame Medemo. Their techniques are similar, but Madame Tui Lou can persevere consistently. Ke Erqiao, though not a top player, has dangerous net play, always watching intently. All incoming balls are intercepted, preventing Qiu Feihai from displaying his strengths.</p>
<h3>Match Summary</h3>
<p>The first and second sets were fiercely contested, with each game tied several times, making it difficult to determine the winner. In the first set, Qiu initially lost 2-3 and 3-4, but eventually won 6-4. In the second set, the Qiu team initially won two games but then lost five consecutive games. They tried hard to rally, catching up to 4-5. In the next game, it rained heavily, and the game was played in the rain, resulting in Qiu's loss and the loss of the set. The rain stopped after that. In the third set, the Qiu team was at a loss, and the opponents won easily with a score of 6-1.</p>
<h3>National Sports Association to Build Three Tennis Courts</h3>

The courts will be located north of the soccer field, and construction is being overseen by Ke Zheng, with completion expected by the end of this month. The grass needed for the grass tennis courts will be supplied from the existing grass on the baseball field. The construction of a basketball court is currently being planned, and if finances are not an issue, construction can begin within this year. The location has been tentatively set north of the soccer field and west of the tennis courts. Due to the terrain and contractual relationships, the track and field and baseball fields will be combined with the soccer field. In addition, the Association, due to the lack of tap water in Shen Yuan, is currently overseeing the digging of a well to supply water.</p>

From today onwards, enrollment will be conducted at three locations: the Morning Post, the Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association, and the Municipal South Clinic, for a period of six weeks.

<h3>The Central University in the Past Two Years (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>(B) Library and Instrument Equipment. School equipment, apart from academic buildings, mainly consists of library and instrument equipment. The current policy is to strive to save administrative expenses to expand the former equipment. Therefore, it is a source of academic teaching and research and cannot be ignored for a moment. Looking back, although the allocation for this equipment was high, there was a year in which the actual expenditure for library and instrument equipment was only 36,582 yuan. In these twenty-one months (up to May 31 of this year), the library fee paid was 142,461 yuan. There are still more than 20,000 yuan that have been determined but not yet paid, which have not been included. A total of 27,458 new Chinese books, 12,138 Western books, 602 Chinese magazines, and 571 Western magazines have been added. The number of copies can be estimated on a regular basis. In particular, supplementing the missing Western magazines in the 20th year of the Republic of China makes people feel the difficulty of the burden. However, the most gratifying thing is that in this short period, all 24 Western magazines have been purchased, such as "Journal furdie reineund angewandteMathematik" from 1826 to the present, a total of 109 years, "MathematischeAnnalen" from 1869 to the present, a total of 65 years, "Berichte der DeuIschen Bctaniechen Gesellschaft" from 1883 to the present, a total of 51 years, "Harvard Iaw Rcvie w" from 1887 to the present, a total of 47 years, have all been purchased. Among them, the most expensive one costs six to seven thousand yuan a set, but for the sake of research, no expense is spared to purchase it.</p>
<p>As for the instrument equipment, the actual expenditure in these twenty-one months was 246,819 yuan and four cents, not counting those that have been determined but not yet arrived. Those listed under consumables have not been totaled, and there are thousands of items. However, due to the urgency of time, some statistical systems have not yet been fully prepared, so they are not listed in detail here. Among them, there is one item worth more than several thousand yuan. This cannot be determined by the number of items. The total expenditure for library and instrument equipment, excluding those that have been determined but not yet paid, has reached 389,280 yuan. The total cost of buildings, library, and instrument equipment is 838,742 yuan.</p>
<p>5. Expanding the Area of ​​School Property In the past two academic years, the area of ​​school property has increased significantly. With the kindness of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was decided to allocate the Wulong and Mufu mountain forest farms in the suburbs to the school. The area of ​​Wulong Mountain is more than 7,700 mu, and the area of ​​Mufu Mountain is more than 6,000 mu, totaling more than 13,700 mu. Land was also purchased in Kunshan Jiangpu to expand the farm, totaling 118 mu. In addition, a sixth dormitory for faculty and staff was purchased near the main campus, costing 11,804 yuan (this was purchased at the end of the 21st year of the Republic of China, before the new campus site was determined). This is the general situation of increasing school property.</p>
<p>6. Centralizing the Location of Colleges for Observation and Convenience. In the past, the offices, teaching, and research locations of each college were very scattered. Some departments of the same college were located in different places, and even in one department, various courses were taught and experimented in different places. After several planning sessions, they are now more centralized. Zhongshan College is now the College of Liberal Arts, the Science Museum is the main building of the College of Science, Southeast College is the College of Law, Nanguo College is the main building of the College of Education, the new classroom is the main building of the College of Engineering, and the College of Agriculture has always been concentrated in Sanpailou, so there is no change.</p>

<h3>How to Train Our Bodies</h3>
<p>— Gong Jitang</p>
<p>A famous Westerner said: "A happy spirit resides in a strong body." What he meant was: "With a strong body, there is a happy spirit."</p>
<p>I think every child knows that a weak body is most susceptible to illness, and illness is very painful. So how can we make our bodies strong? Simply put:</p>
<p>1. Don't eat snacks, and don't eat too much at meals;</p>
<p>2. Do not eat irritating foods (such as cigarettes, tea, etc.)</p>
<p>3. Do not eat raw and unclean things;</p>
<p>4. Get up early and go to bed early, and have regular rest;</p>
<p>5. Pay attention to the weather and add or subtract our clothes;</p>
<p>6. Bathe often to keep your body clean.</p>
<p>I think children have already heard these points from the teachers in the school. The reason why I repeat them now is that I hope the children will keep them in mind and practice them every day, so that every child will have a lively and healthy body.</p>
<h3>How Did Yan Hui Become a Great Sage?</h3>
<p>— Jin Rong</p>
<p>Children! Do you know Yan Hui, a great sage of thousands of years ago? He was a student of Confucius. When he was young, his family was very poor. At that time, his classmates often bullied him and even said that he stole things. Later, when Confucius found out, he wanted to test Yan Hui's character.</p>
<p>One day, a piece of silver was found in Yan Hui's desk, with a note attached, which read "Heaven bestows Yan Hui a piece of silver." After reading it, he wrote "Unexpected wealth does not enrich a poor man" and put it back in place.</p>
<p>After this test, Confucius knew that Yan Hui was a good student, so he taught him all his talents, and he became a great sage.</p>
<h3>Mutual Help</h3>
<p>— Nai Chang</p>
<p>Early in the morning, leaning against the window and looking down at the street, I saw two pitiful people. Children, who do you think are the most pitiful people in the world? Aren't they those homeless, hungry, and cold beggars? But the two beggars I saw were the most pitiful among the pitiful; because one was legless and the other was blind!</p>
<p>A legless person cannot run, and a blind person cannot see the road. But these two pitiful people were smart. They combined the parts of each person that were not disabled and became a healthy person!</p>
<p>How did they combine? It's that the blind person carries the legless person on his back. The blind person has legs, and they are healthy legs; the legless person has eyes, and they are healthy eyes. In this way, when they combine, they become a person with bright eyes and healthy legs!</p>
<p>This scene touched me and made me think that people should help each other, shouldn't they, children? If we can all help each other, use our strengths to help others, and use the strengths of others to make up for our own shortcomings, we can all run on the bright road in big strides; in this way, we will not regress or decline!</p>
<h3>Great Children</h3>
<p>— Qin Yunxian</p>
<p>Children, children,</p>

<h3>Soda</h3>
<p>— Duxin</p>
<p>One afternoon, Dad opened a soda for Ming'er to drink. As soon as the bottle cap was opened, the gas followed the water from the bottle into the glass. So, Ming'er asked; "Dad, I have drunk soda, but I don't know what this gas is. Can you tell me today?"</p>
<p>"The gas that comes out? Let me tell you, it's carbonic acid gas," Dad said.</p>
<p>"Carbonic acid gas, Dad, I don't want to drink it anymore. The teacher said that this gas is harmful to our body," Ming'er shook his head and said.</p>
<p>"Ha! You're wrong, Ming'er. You only know that it's harmful to the lungs, but you don't know that it's beneficial to the stomach. Now, you're not inhaling this gas, but drinking this gas. Inhaling it, it goes to the lungs and is harmful, but drinking it, it goes to the stomach and is beneficial to you. Drink it quickly, child, Dad will have a glass too."</p>
<p>So, Ming'er smiled, and he quickly drank the soda. But Dad said again.</p>
<p>"Ming'er, I'm telling you, you can't drink too much soda. If you drink too much, your digestion will be in poor condition, because it contains alkaline baking soda. Everything in the world, eating less is always more delicious!"</p>
<h3>The Origin of Shoes</h3>
<p>— Jingying</p>
<p>Children, aren't you wearing shoes every day? But do you know its origin? Now I will tell you some!</p>
<p>People before the invention of shoes had no shoes to wear. All day long, they walked barefoot in the thorny mountains and forests, living a barbaric life. However, the king's palace was paved with brocade carpets. One day, when the king married the princess of a neighboring country, the king ordered that ten miles of carpets be laid from the front of the palace, and he stood on it to welcome his beautiful queen. After waiting for a long time, he still did not see her come. The king was very anxious, so he walked forward. When he walked to the end of the ten-mile-long carpet, he heard the sound of a group of horseshoes galloping from far to near. Then came a group of cavalry, with his beautiful queen in the middle. The king could not help but forget everything and ran to embrace her. Later, when he returned to the palace, he found that the soles of his feet were scratched by stones. He was very frustrated, but he could not think of a proper solution. Soon, his queen came up with this plan. She summoned the smartest people in the country, cut animal skins into shapes similar to the soles of the feet, and used ropes to tie them to the feet. So the king was very happy and ordered all the people of the country to make this foot protection item.</p>
<h3>How Far Is the Earth from the Sun?</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>From the Earth we stand on to the Sun we look at, the distance in between, according to astronomers, is 93 million miles, equivalent to 260 million Chinese miles. Exactly how far this number is, is still unclear in our minds; we can't imagine how far.</p>
<p>Now, let's use a few metaphors to illustrate, and everyone will be surprised when they hear it.</p>
<h3>It Would Take Two and a Half Years to Count</h3>
<p>If we spend one minute counting from one to two hundred, then we can count to 288,000 every day and night, without eating or sleeping, non-stop for twenty-four hours each day; this number is about one-323rd of 93 million. So, it would take 323 days, or ten and a half months, to finish counting this number. This is without stopping for even one second. If we calculate according to the current "three-eight system," we should add three times the time, which would be thirty-one months plus a few days, or two years plus a few days. Do you think this distance is far?</p>
<h3>It Would Take 358 Years to Travel by Beijing-Shanghai Train</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai express train travels at 30 miles per hour. If we travel from the Earth to the Sun at the speed of the Beijing-Shanghai train, it would take 358 years to reach it. Assuming we set off during the Wuchang Uprising, we wouldn't reach the Sun and see its wonders until 257 years of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>It Would Take 54 Years to Travel by Airplane</h3>
<p>The fastest way to travel is by airplane. If we travel by a biplane flying at 197 miles per hour, it would only take three hours to fly from Beiping to Nanjing. But to fly from the Earth to the Sun, it would take 54 years. Children! If you are eleven years old this year and set off from the ground, flying towards the Sun, then by the time you stop on the Sun, you will be a sixty-five-year-old man with a white beard!</p>

<h3>A Practitioner of the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>— Ge Shoumin, a student of Shanghai Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>What is the New Life? The New Life just teaches us how to be human. To make the country strong, we must implement the New Life; to implement the New Life, we must first train ourselves.</p>
<p>Who do you think is a practitioner of the New Life Movement? Not a great man in politics, not a hero in the military, not an inventor with agile thoughts, but a young apprentice in a national goods store. He gets up early every day, works diligently, respects his teachers and elders, loves his colleagues, pays attention to cleanliness, and also works hard. He still reads for an hour in the morning before the store opens. It is a pity that he cannot go to bed early at night because of his low position and job. If he were born in a wealthy family, he could really make a career in the future.</p>
<p>This young apprentice has already practiced the New Life. Let's get up quickly and implement the New Life Movement.</p>

<h3>The Simplest Animated Shadow Play</h3>
<p>— Mi Shutong</p>
<p>Materials: White paper, pencil, scissors. Production method: Cut two strips of white paper with scissors, one and a half inches wide and about five inches long, stack them together, and then use a pencil to draw a crying face on the left end of the top strip of paper, and a smiling face on the same end of the bottom strip of paper. Then, wrap the top strip of paper around the pencil to give it some elastic recoil. Now you can start playing. Playing method: Align the paper strips on the table, press down on the right end of the paper strips with your right hand, and move our pencil left and right along the paper strips. At that time, you will see a face that sometimes cries and sometimes smiles, as if it is going crazy.</p>
<p>Children, you can draw other things on the paper strips yourself, and you will have the same interest. This game is very simple, but there are a few things to pay attention to. First, the white paper must be slightly stiff, otherwise it will not have elastic recoil; second, the drawing should be clear, and the drawings on the upper and lower paper strips should match, otherwise it will not be clear.</p>
<p>Small Talk on Summer Hygiene</p>
<h3>Food on Stalls</h3>
<p>— Jianfen</p>
<p>Children, summer is here! On both sides of the road, you can see many stalls, with a wide variety of food on the stalls, such as water chestnuts, candied plums, peanut candy... countless varieties.</p>
<p>Speaking of the equipment of the stalls, there is only a wooden board and a pole that can be carried for walking; other than the food being sold, there is nothing else in the pole. The stall owners put the food being sold on the wooden board, letting the sand and ash accumulate on it, and the flies stop on it. As long as the food is sold, that's all; hygiene is not discussed at all.</p>
<p>Therefore: Children who like to buy snacks at stalls: when you buy them, first check the food to see if there is sand and ash accumulated on it! Are there any fly eggs on it! These are all things that should be paid attention to before buying and eating. If you find sand and ash and fly eggs on the food, then you might as well endure your cravings and not buy it to eat; because if you carelessly buy it and eat it, you will feel unwell in your stomach, or even get sick.</p>
<p>Finally: I hope the little friends who like to buy snacks at the stalls: quickly change this bad habit and don't go to unhygienic stalls to buy things to eat.</p>
<h3>The Cat and the Fox</h3>
<p>— Chengzhao</p>
<p>Once, a cat and a fox were sitting together in the forest, chatting.</p>
<p>The fox said, "No matter what important things happen, I don't care. Because I have all kinds of clever tricks that can solve all difficulties."</p>
<p>The fox also said, "Ms. Cat, what will you do if you are suddenly attacked or threatened by someone?"</p>
<p>The cat smiled and replied to the fox, "Mr. Fox, I only have one plan. If this plan doesn't work, then I can only die!"</p>
<p>The fox frowned and said, "Madam, I am very worried about you. I wanted to teach you a few clever tricks, but it is not appropriate to rely on others. We should still take care of ourselves."</p>
<p>The fox had just finished speaking when a large group of hunting dogs attacked them both with all their might.</p>
<p>With his only agility, the fox climbed up a tree and sat quietly on a branch.</p>
<p>Although the fox had many clever tricks, it could not escape, and was bitten to death by the hunting dogs.</p>
<p>Children, the safe plan is not about having many. You can know this by looking at the fox's death!</p>
<h3>Rural Children's Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>Silkworm babies hatch from tiny black spots: they sleep a few times and shed their outer clothes several times; their black and yellow bodies become bright, crystal-clear, snow-white, and fat babies, climbing onto the silkworm mountain, spinning silk to make cocoons, and hiding inside. In a few days, they come out again, and at this time, they become silkworm moths with wings that cannot fly far, laying eggs on paper.</p>
<p>The rice seedlings in the paddy fields are all growing vigorously. Frogs use their hind legs to jump around: opening their big mouths, many small insects are always buried in their bellies. So they triumphantly play a triumphal song. Suddenly, with a "wa" sound, this triumphant fellow is caught and wrapped by a snake mother; a few minutes pass, and he becomes someone else's bread. Frog! Poor frog!</p>
<p>Because the snake mother is full, her swimming is also a bit sluggish; she is seen by a little friend, who shoulders a bamboo stick and hits the snake, hitting it right on the head and killing it. Snake, do you still remember the triumphant time when you ate the field frog?</p>
<p>Friends, frogs eat small insects, snakes eat frogs, and little friends hit snakes. Although these are small things in the animal kingdom; but, in the world, there is power and hegemony, bullying the weak. This is a microcosm for us to see, and we should carefully savor it!</p>
<h3>Children All Over the World</h3>

<p>(1) This is a child from India. The place where they live is very hot. Most of them run naked in the sun or play by the sea. They also keep very long hair, wrapped in five-colored cloth.</p>
<p>(2) This is a child from the Philippines. His body is as black as chocolate. He doesn't wear clothes, and he often wears a piece of cloth on his lower body.</p>
<p>(3) This is an American native. Look how beautiful his clothes are. His skin is red. He likes hunting, archery, and decorating with crow feathers.</p>
<p>(4) These are children from Egypt. The place where they live is mostly desert and very hot, but they wear very large clothes and wrap their heads. Their shoes are very similar to Chinese shoes.</p>

<p>Women's World My Ideal Future Life Special Issue</p>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>All human beings, as long as they are not idiots, have their future aspirations.</p>
<p>An ideal future not only requires individual efforts, but also has a close relationship with the era and society at that time. If we disregard the progress of the times and the changes in the social environment, and blindly fantasize, that is just a fool's dream.</p>
<p>China in this era, Chinese young women in this era. Living in this colonial environment, what exactly is their ideal future life like? This is worth paying close attention to. This is also the motive for publishing this special issue.</p>
<p>The result of soliciting articles was that the number of applicants was beyond our expectations. But the regret is that most of the hardworking and distressed women not only cannot express their expectations in this small garden, but they have not even acquired the ability to read! In addition, they are either busy with life or do not pay attention to the news, so they naturally miss the opportunity. Therefore, although we received many manuscripts, we can only say that they are a minority among the minority. However, in this minority, we can also see several types, such as (1) those who are infatuated with rosy dreams, (2) those who yearn for a single life, (3) those who hate the city and want to escape to the countryside, (4) those who only want to dedicate themselves to society, and (5) those who take the transformation of the entire society as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>China is still China, China is still a semi-colonial country, how many women can have a happy life? How many women can find a suitable job? Where is the happy land in the countryside? Where should we go? Smart people will understand, right?</p>
<h3>(I)</h3>
<p>— Pan Xuezhen</p>
<p>Suppose I am already married. My husband would naturally be very happy with me, because now he is already very intimate with me, and very understanding of me.</p>
<p>Under the shade of swaying green willows and blooming red peach blossoms, appears the residence of my husband and I. Quietly and serenely silent, only the sound of cicadas can be heard. There, I lean alone against the window, knitting his wool sweater. Suddenly I hear footsteps. It turns out he has returned. Oh! Before I knew it, it was already half past five.</p>
<p>Now I am no longer making wool sweaters. What I am sewing in my hands are children's clothes, because I am already six months pregnant.</p>
<p>After a long time, one evening, he embraces his child, kissing him. He says how lovely this little angel is. Indeed, since I had her, I have been extraordinarily happy.</p>
<p>This is a glimpse of my ideal future life.</p>
<h3>(II)</h3>
<p>— Pinxian</p>
<p>Lately, when I come into contact with the opposite sex, I can't help but feel shy. I am startled to realize that I am already a mature virgin (Village girls are raised in their mother-in-law's home and get married as early as ten years old!).</p>
<p>When I am alone, under the moon, among the flowers, even in my dreams, I anticipate the future, the future?</p>
<p>I will first carefully choose my eternal partner. Our union will be based on love, and cannot succumb to a commercial transaction.</p>
<p>My husband should be an intelligent, healthy young man who can make a living, regardless of his profession, and without any bad habits.</p>
<p>If possible, I will leave my parents-in-law and form a small family with my husband.</p>
<p>Our study will be filled with famous works of international translations, science, politics, and literature; if my husband is a businessman, there will also be some business news.</p>
<p>At home, I will prepare more nutritious and easily digestible dishes like vegetables and eggs. When my husband returns from the office, I will carefully prepare the dishes and bring them to his table. When my husband is busy eating, I think: he will appreciate the goodness of his wife.</p>
<p>But I would like to entrust the housework to a female servant and find a suitable job for myself.</p>
<p>We will of course have children. If I give birth to a girl in my first pregnancy, when someone asks, I don't want to hear my husband sigh and say, "Just a girl!" A good daughter is equal to a good son.</p>
<p>When we are free, my head rests in my husband's arms, the child's arms embrace my legs, and my husband hums love poems about pickled mustard greens or the Song of Everlasting Regret: "In the heavens, may we be birds flying wing to wing; on earth, may we be trees with branches twined from limb to limb!"</p>
<p>We all know how to love our country, care about national affairs, and love to use domestic goods.</p>
<p>Whether they are boys or girls, we will send our children to schools that are suitable for the needs of society. I will give them a sweet kiss every day, and they will repay me with filial piety.</p>
<p>Chastity must be mutually maintained by men and women. If my husband has an affair with a young girl, or if anyone else has one, I will immediately divorce him without hesitation.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no feast in the world that does not end. If I die before my husband, I promise my husband to remarry, and vice versa.</p>
<h3>(III)</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Ah! It is shameful to say. The life of my dreams is envisioned in my mind almost every day, but dreams are always just dreams.</p>
<p>Like a ship without a rudder, I have spent my past dreamlike life in the tide of humanity, filled with suffering, sorrow... I have tried several times to reform my psychology, change my ideals to adapt to the environment, but I cannot, I will never be able to. I just hope, I always hope!</p>
<p>I hope that one day I can escape the infighting of my large family, and go with him to form a small family that can realize our ideals, and live our poetic life together!</p>
<p>Get up when the sky is just beginning to brighten, tidy up the housework, and then lead my two or three children to the park to enjoy the supreme enjoyment of nature: do some calisthenics myself, and then teach them to play ball, sail small boats, read books and newspapers... spend this first half of the day (of course, the older children must be sent to school, and lunch must be taken care of myself).</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I will take on half a day of schoolwork at a small school to increase some income and help with expenses.</p>
<p>At night, under his guidance, I will read some books to increase some necessary knowledge, and at the same time supervise the children</p>
<p>to review their homework from the day.</p>
<p>This is the future life of my dreams, perhaps shallow enough to be laughable!</p>
<h3>(IV)</h3>
<p>— Jingqi</p>
<p>I have grown up in the city since I was a child, but the future life of my dreams! I hope to be in the countryside, which contains poetry and conveys meaning to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>In front, there is a boundless wheat field, with a small stream and weeping willows on both sides, and lush green trees behind. Amidst this environment, there is a thatched cottage. Except for two windows and a door, it is covered with ivy. The walls inside are light yellow, and are decorated with sky blue palace lanterns. The furniture is a complete set of cream-colored, small, exquisite, Western-style furniture. In the middle hangs a portrait of a loving mother who loves with all her heart. On the table are the calligraphic and painting works of the loving mother. I will be the owner of this house, with an old woman and two beautiful kittens. I get up at dawn and take a walk in the fields and water flowers. Then I have breakfast and write large and small characters, and practice cursive script. After lunch, I rest until dinner, and I am writing manuscripts all the time. I make a living by selling articles. In the meantime, if I feel tired, I will play the pipa and blow the xiao. After dinner, I will go with the old woman to listen to stories and myths from the neighboring farmers. I will go to the city once a month to visit my parents, see relatives and friends, and collect manuscript fees, and I hope to often encounter some unexpected little things to regulate the ordinary and boring life.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a noble and talented friend of the opposite sex, who will be my lifelong confidant, but I will never marry him, and I will not meet him often, but I will often communicate with him and conduct various academic discussions, which will be considered spiritual comfort only. Besides this, I will never associate with a third person of the opposite sex, and even my friends of the same sex will be no more than three or five people at most.</p>
<p>Well, if my future life can be like this, then my ideal will be realized.</p>
<h3>(V)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Junyu</p>
<p>I am a seventeen-year-old girl; a student studying at a midwifery school. I don't hope to be a great person in the political world in the future, a famous person in society, or to enjoy some noble life; but I also have a goal to move forward, and this goal can represent what my ideal future life is. Of course, this ideal may seem too small to women with great ambitions.</p>
<p>What is this goal? It is to hope to become a successful obstetrician who can maintain the health and safety of mothers and babies in the future.</p>
<p>In China, where science is underdeveloped, everything lags behind others. Even obstetrics, which uses scientific methods to deliver babies, has only attracted the attention of Chinese people in recent years, and people have only begun to advocate it and learn it. However, short-term efforts cannot overthrow the old forces in one fell swoop: the old methods of delivery are still deeply rooted and difficult to defeat. Those old women (i.e., midwives) who have no knowledge and completely rely on fate still fill the society and occupy a large position. Therefore, one can often see in newspapers many records about old women who have injured mothers by mistake, and one can also hear similar unfortunate narrations from people's mouths. I have personally seen a relative die at the hands of an ignorant old woman during childbirth. This terrible phenomenon makes me feel that it is really necessary for us women to work hard to study obstetrics and eliminate the old-fashioned midwives. Because the death of one person is of course a loss to the country, and the weakness of a mother and baby has a great impact on the health of the nation! Therefore, after graduating from junior high school, I transferred to a midwifery school to study. I will graduate next year. After graduation, I decided to first practice in an obstetrics hospital for a few years, using the existing knowledge in books as the basis for on-the-spot practical exploration. At that time, I thought that no matter what, I would not muddle-headedly kill the mother.</p>
<p>In these few years, I am working hard to build the foundation for realizing my ideal life. After I have considerable ability, I will unite with a few others to open an obstetrics hospital in the inland, and at the same time, using methods that gradually win people's hearts, promote the benefits of scientific delivery and the dangers of old-fashioned delivery, so as to invisibly defeat the power of the old women. Then, depending on my ability, I will establish one or several midwifery schools to train midwifery talents and replace the old women's positions. Although the old forces are very difficult to eradicate, if everyone can do their best, then there is nothing in the world that cannot be done!</p>
<p>This is the future life of my dreams, this life</p>
<p>is of course extremely hard and has no great hope, but I believe that being able to become an obstetrician who is beneficial to the health of the nation is not meaningless.</p>
<h3>(VI)</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiuling</p>
<p>"Ideals are beautiful, facts are sad." Of course, I am no exception. The ideal future life cannot escape the beautiful ideal.</p>
<p>The future life of my dreams is to hope to be a teacher, getting along with that group of lively, lovely, innocent children every day.</p>
<p>Because children are the masters of the future country, they are urgently in need of good education and cultivation.</p>
<p>Although my academic ability is not high and I have no experience to speak of, because I am still studying in the second year of high school normal school, I will not spare any effort to do it, because this is my interest and aspiration, especially my responsibility.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I can make efforts to study the knowledge I want to study in the spare time in the evening and morning, and I must also study a good, new education system to replace the current education system that I am not satisfied with.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoons and Sundays, I will take a walk in the park, or invite colleagues to play in the suburbs. In this way, the fatigue of a week's work can be easily sent away here. If there is still spare time, I can read books, or invite a few children who are usually more clever to play the piano and sing songs together to regulate this educational life.</p>
<p>The life of a teacher is the most beautiful life. The future life of my dreams is to live this beautiful life of a teacher.</p>
<h3>(VII)</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>It is probably mostly due to the influence of my parents that I have unconsciously developed this tendency to be indifferent to fame and fortune and almost want to live in seclusion. I have never admired any extravagance since I was a child, and this tendency seems to be more obvious as I grow up. I have also lived in the city for quite some time. The civilization of the city cannot tempt me, a person from the mountains and fields. The tense air in the city makes people breathe, and the skin, flesh, and bones of the whole body will also become tense and uncomfortable. After this powerful test, I am even more convinced that I am not worthy of living in this atmosphere. I hate that kind of life, I despise that so-called urban civilization, what I need is a simple, tranquil, and leisurely life. At this time when the country is so chaotic, this requirement may be scolded, but this is, after all, a requirement, or a dream. Whether it can be realized is still unknown. Even if it can be realized, it will have to be many years later. When I am old, if I encounter this kind of tranquil life again, perhaps it can still be forgiven.</p>
<p>My hometown is a small semi-rural town. Although it has not lost its original rural atmosphere, it has been dyed with many urban habits, so I still have more dislike for it. In the future, if possible, I want to live in a very simple village with mountains and rivers. The houses are sufficient for living and use, there is a wide square for exercise, and there is land around to grow things. I will live with companions who have similar hobbies and interests. It is best to have one who is older and one who is younger. The older one has experience and judgment, because I have too little experience, especially little judgment. Therefore, I definitely need such a person. Younger people are more energetic and can accompany me in activities so that I will not get old. I think that the increase in a person's age is not the easiest thing to make a person old, only the lack of vigor is dangerous. I am afraid of seeing those people who are old and decadent before they are old.</p>
<p>Every day, in addition to necessary work, there is a fixed time for reading, time for singing, playing musical instruments, and spare time for exercise. The open space next to the house is for us to grow our own things. I like this kind of farming the most. The harvested things are for our food and clothing. Or there is a risk of not having enough, so we must first gather some property as a fund, and start accumulating before this ideal is realized.</p>
<p>This is an ideal without any extravagance. Perhaps it can be fulfilled, but if there are no companions and no funds, then the ideal will always be an ideal, and my body will only be able to float and sink in the crowd.</p>
<h3>(VIII)</h3>
<p>— Fangping</p>
<p>I have grown up in the countryside since I was a child. In the countryside, the humble status of women is shocking to say. My mother and I, under the shackles of thousands of years of traditional feudalism, have tasted a lot of miserable and inhuman life; until now, due to the invasion and oppression of international imperialists, the countryside is increasingly in bankruptcy, and our general women are living like pigs and dogs under the pressure of life. When men get angry and come home, we can be said to be the only objects of their anger. It is as if all their poverty is caused by us.</p>
<p>In real life, experience tells me: if we are not to be bound by the old feudal forces and old ethics, we must not depend on men economically, and our economy must be on an equal footing with men; and the liberation of women in general is not a partial problem, but a social problem as a whole. If the social system does not seek a fundamental solution, the so-called women's problem will also be impossible to solve, because first of all, we cannot get rid of economic dependence, get rid of being a man's private property, or even a commodity; first of all, we cannot allow the majority of women to get rid of poverty and enjoy a true human life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ideal life I envision for the future is not the kind of happy and ideal family that the average lady dreams of, because this has become impossible for us. In reality, life does not allow us to have such a good dream, and what we hope for is that the majority of our women have a true human life, and I hope to seek a solution to this from the overall social problem!</p>
<p>Therefore, the future life of my dreams is that I want to start from now, try my best to overcome my old nature, strengthen my consciousness, and recognize the mission I bear in women: in the practice of life, I will, together with women who are under the same multiple pressures of life, seek the way to truly liberate women in the future life.</p>
<p>In the future life, I hope not to have a slave-like marriage, to submerge the meaning of my life as a "person," but I may as well get married if it does not harm my work and if there is a suitable opportunity. As for a happy family, I only hope for it when everyone is happy.</p>
<p>As long as I am advancing on the road of "being a person," as long as I can do enough of what I can in the process of women's liberation, so that we will eventually have a day to be a person, this is the future life of my dreams.</p>
<h3>(IX)</h3>
<p>— Fengzi</p>
<p>The reason why human beings can still struggle to live in extreme pain is because they have an ideal for the future of life, which can make them forget the past, endure the present, and hope for the future. However, because the environment is different, everyone has their own ideals, and there is an ideal for every era. I remember when I was studying at a normal school in the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic of China, because I read Ms. Bingxin's works such as The Lost, Superman, etc., and Tagore's Stray Birds, plus a kind of writing that was very popular at that time, I was influenced by that kind of writing, and my dream was full of truth, goodness, beauty, and love. In fact, my life was very poor and painful at that time, but because my heart was beautified for a while, I ignored the pain I was suffering at the moment. Since graduating in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China until now, what I have experienced and felt in these eight years has made me realize that my dream was wrong; I understand that there is no truth, goodness, beauty, and love in the current society, but it is used to decorate this dark society. I don't want to do this kind of self-deceiving dream anymore. Now I want to understand that we are in an extremely tense life, the economic aggression of imperialism is intensifying day by day, a group of men are oppressed by the economy to the point where they cannot breathe, and we women are living a life of slaves under slaves under multiple oppressions, what leisure do we have to do that leisurely and elegant dream? But I am not completely desperate. My ideals are:</p>
<p>1.  To have something to do in society and be economically independent.</p>
<p>2.  Men and women should be combined based on the same interests and harmonious feelings, without any restrictions, and no one should dominate anyone.</p>
<p>3.  There should be good nurseries and public kitchen facilities in the society, so that we can get rid of this family burden and concentrate on doing our own business.</p>
<p>4.  During pregnancy and childbirth, we can have adequate rest, and our career and salary will not be affected. In this way, women can be free people.</p>
<p>I know that although my ideals are not very high, it is very difficult to realize them, because the life of an individual is a corner of the entire society. Only with a rational society can we talk about</p>
<p>the day when my ideal life will be realized.</p>

<p>— Liaoer</p>
<p>On September 18th, the iron hooves of Japan stepped into my hometown of Shenyang. At that time, I was in the dormitory of a certain university in the old capital, having a sweet dream! When I woke up, I couldn't go home anymore. Pain, panic, resentment, and annoyance filled my heart. I saw that some of my classmates were stomping their feet and beating their chests, wanting to join the army, and some were leisurely and carefree without caring about anything. There were even... I don't want to write about it anymore here. The past is gone. Now that I am living in Shanghai, which is half foreign, I have other reveries:</p>
<p>"1934" has been half-rolled away by the wheel of time, and "1936" is not just around the corner? Death rays, poison gas, germ bombs, and poison needle cannons are already openly and secretly being invented and manufactured? We are certainly all clamoring about how to save the country, but in such a chaotic situation, how can we, these disorganized and untrained lumps of flesh, meet this future disaster? When that disaster comes, perhaps there is no way to hide or avoid it. We, who have no weapons in our hands, naturally have to fight with our flesh! But we also need to be organized.</p>
<p>I look forward to the bright clouds in the future. But we must unite to cross this death line. This is the life I hope to realize in the nearest future.</p>
<h3>(XI)</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Like fish in the Yellow River, if the Yellow River floods, then all the fish, big and small, and even the fish eggs that are still being nurtured, will suffer the same fate, at most with different degrees of severity. This depends on whether the fish are at the focus or the tail end of the flood.</p>
<p>People cannot live without the environment they live in and the people of the same era. It may not be easy to be a hermit in the 20th century, and it seems that there are very few fools who claim to be aloof. When people are struggling for the truth, they will not hesitate at all and will move forward bravely in a solid group.</p>
<p>If people are not blind or deaf, they will more or less feel a little frightened by the chaotic affairs of this world standing on the dividing line. Those who are near the muzzles and blades will undoubtedly scream in the shooting, followed by those who are a little farther away braving the bullets and blades to rescue, which is also self-help at the same time. People always care about things that are related to their own part of the position, unless they are blinded by psychedelic drugs, they will not be indifferent.</p>
<p>At the junction of darkness and light, on the eve of the struggle between truth and demons, the drastic upheaval is inevitable and unavoidable. People may complain about being unfortunate to be born in this upheaval, but can't it be said to be a kind of happiness? This is a tight and stimulating life!</p>
<p>Therefore, in this great decision, we must prepare ourselves and not be onlookers. Of course, in fact, we are definitely not allowed to.</p>
<p>Women seem to be like blind people covered with double cloths, but when humanity wakes up, our cloths will be removed, the light will reappear in front of us, and we can run on the right and wrong paths, whichever we want.</p>
<p>The facts also tell us to run to the side of the public reason of the majority of people, where is our powerful camp, which will give us encouragement and courage to fight for the stolen loot and fight for the fairness snatched with blood and flesh.</p>
<p>We don't covet the peace and happiness of seeking temporary comfort. This world will not allow you to be at ease, hesitate, or doze off, otherwise you will be trampled into cannon fodder.</p>
<p>At the end of the cliff, on the bank of the river where the bridge is broken, resolutely decide your own path, people will sacrifice the small self and move forward on the position of the big self. The light of the future is anxiously burning people's hearts.</p>
<p>There are no heroes, only countless soldiers marching in the same big team, based on the public belief.</p>
<p>Countless privates, I am also one of them.</p>
<h3>Finance Under Sustained Selling Pressure, Bullion Price Breaks Through the 1,000 Yuan Barrier, | Continuing to Fall by 7.9 Jiao |</h3>
<p>Since the sudden price drop in the gold market the day before yesterday, public sentiment has been pessimistic, and it is difficult to see a resurgence. Therefore, this morning, the overseas silver market exchange rates did not increase much. However, public sentiment was already weary, making it difficult to pull prices up. As a result, the 1,000 yuan barrier was finally breached, and a selling atmosphere permeated the market. Fortunately, it was almost noon, and the Central Bank intervened with spot purchases and Guangbang's acceptance of delivery notes, slightly curbing the selling trend. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market saw the British pound rise and the US dollar remain stable. The difference between near-term and far-term silver prices on the Gold and Silver Exchange was negligible, with near-term prices slightly lower and far-term prices slightly higher. Exchange rates opened higher but closed lower. London spot gold rose by half a penny, US cotton fell by nine points, US wheat rose by six and a quarter points, and stocks fell by 1.57 yuan. The various telegrams from the day before yesterday have already been detailed in the newspapers. Raw material prices opened higher at eight yuan, but ultimately trended downward due to oversupply and downstream weakness. By the time pre-market trading opened, the situation was extremely weak. After the opening, bank demand was healthy, and although it was relatively stable, news of HSBC's exchange rate quotes showing the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 0.25 led to strong selling pressure from suppliers, and the situation became one of sideways trading, contending around five yuan. When the Seattle overnight silver price report came in, showing a rise of 1.25 and no change, the short sellers took advantage of the situation to amplify their efforts, and the selling trend began to take shape. This was because public sentiment was already uneasy, and the bulls were more restrained. Fellow traders aggressively filled the market with US dollar sales, and when the domestic market loosened, the downward momentum took hold. Unfavorable news, such as the US Treasury Department's gradual increase in silver purchases, which would inevitably lead to the issuance of more silver certificates, although unconfirmed, certainly contributed to the selling trend in the current declining market. The gold price gradually fell, and although there were large buyers intervening, they could not hold the price up. Bank demand was overwhelmed by the aggressive sales of fellow traders, and the domestic market suddenly became loose and flooded, leading to the breaking of the 1,000 yuan barrier. The Central Bank intervened with spot purchases, and Guangbang took the opportunity to buy at low prices, slightly raising the price. However, the 1,000 yuan level could not be sustained. As it approached the noon closing, banks took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and there were no major changes afterward. The price of pure gold was 1,014.7 yuan. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1,005.7 yuan, down one yuan from the previous closing. Raw material prices opened at 5.6 yuan. Exchange rates opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 3 pence 8125 for the British pound and 33.1875 yuan for the US dollar. Dadecheng, Hengyu, and Yuanchun all sold, retreating to 4.7 yuan. Pangeng bought August US dollars at 4375. Shengda, Yongde, Dadecheng, Shunmao, Yuqing, Yongying, Fenghengfu, Yutong, and Taichang bought, rising to 5.9 yuan. Anticipating HSBC's exchange rate quotes showing the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 0.25, Yuanmao, Yongsenchang, Yongda, Xingyongyi, Fengyongdadecheng, Hengyu, and others all sold, falling to 4.2 yuan. MacGalli covered October US dollars at 625, September at 5625, and remained stable. Tongfeng, Hengfu, Xingyongdadecheng, Daxingyonglai, and others entered, gradually rising to above 5 yuan. Mitsui Sumitomo covered October US dollars at 5625, and Huixiang worked hard to buy delivery notes, rising again to 5.8 yuan. Fuyu, Yuanmao, and Yong sold to within 5 yuan. At this time, Futaiheng and Fuan still accepted, pulling the price up by one yuan. However, because Shenkang and Fuyu still supplied, the situation was difficult to improve significantly. Tongyiyuanyi sold slightly, retreating to within 5 yuan. After the Seattle overnight silver price report came in showing a rise of 1.25, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongyuanchang, Yongyongfeng, Dingtai, Dadecheng, and others sold off, falling to within 4 yuan. Yuanyida and Xingyong entered, but as public sentiment was downward, sellers in the market were brave. Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yifeng, Yongdadecheng, Yiyu, Fuxing, Yonghengxingyuan, and others successively sold off, and the domestic market followed suit, falling to 4.7 yuan. Shunmao, Yuqingyong, and Futaiheng entered, but as the selling atmosphere permeated the market, Tongchun, Fuyu, Yuqingyongshenchangyong, and others supplied delivery notes, and retail investors aggressively pressed down, the 1,000 yuan barrier was finally broken, falling to 998.8 yuan. Shengda vigorously entered, once rising to 1,000 yuan. Tianfengyong and others came to sell, and it retreated again to 998.6 yuan. The news of the Central Bank's spot intervention spread throughout the market, and there were more buyers taking advantage of the low prices. MacGalli, Shanghai Huabi bought September US dollars at 75. Hongli, Yuanyi, Yifengyong, Bingxing, and Dadecheng entered at 1,000.4 yuan. Fuyu entered and then exited. Senchangyong and Huixiang also sold, still falling to within 999 yuan. Banks covered October US dollars at 875 and stabilized. Hovering around the 9 yuan mark. The noon closing was 998.8 yuan. Raw material prices were quoted at 8.2 yuan. The situation after the market closed was slightly uncertain, initially low and then rising. The highest price for the half-day was 1,005.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 998.6 yuan, a fluctuation of 7.3 yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 7.9 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price, due to the Exchange Bank's US dollar exchange rate quote rising by 0.25 to 32.75 yuan, combined for a bullion price of 1,056.49 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 57 yuan lower. The difference from the previous closing was extremely small. The registration price for July was 999 yuan, and for August it was 999 yuan. The morning supplement was 999 yuan. The price of pure gold was 1,014.7 yuan, approximately 9 yuan higher. Market trading was sluggish, and Tianjin goods were approximately 11 yuan higher, with few transactions. The Central Bank intervened with approximately 700 spot notes at a price of 999 yuan, equal to the futures price. These notes were handled by spot dealers such as Tongfenghengdadechengyingfengheng, and among them were futures notes submitted by Futaiheng through account transfers. Although the price was higher than the spot intervention price, fellow traders were happy to sell because of the one-yuan discount from swap trades. The swap was given by Cuitai to Hengyu for one yuan. Approximately 5,000 July notes remained.</p>
<p>Market trading was chaotic. In summary, Shengda, Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Tongfeng, Hengyu, Qingyong, Huixiang, Chunyuan, Yongfuxingyongfuan, Yingfengheng, Tianfeng, Dachangxiang, Dafayong, Wanxing, Shunli, and others were on the buying side, while Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongyifengyongsenchangyongqianchangxiangfuyu, Yiyu, Hengxingyuan, Shenkang, Yongdeyuanmao, Yongfengxiang, Hehongxing, Yuantianfengyong, and others were on the selling side. Futaiheng and Dadecheng initially exited and then entered. Yuqingyong and Huixiang initially entered and then exited. Dalian Gang Wanxing jointly traded over 1,600 notes, netting over 600 notes. Shunli jointly traded over 1,400 notes, netting approximately 200. Guangbang Hengxing entered and exited several dozen notes each. Shengda entered over 400 notes, with a small number exiting.

<h3>Weekend Foreign Interbank Lending Rates Remain Unchanged</h3>

The addition of water to the forward rate was only 2-3%, and ultimately it was a white draw, with a plain and unremarkable situation. Moreover, yesterday was Saturday, and because of the afternoon holiday, the banks' settlement procedures were unusually simple.

<h3>Securities With Actual Goods Sold, Many Retail Investors Exited, Public Bonds Rebounded and Started to Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a reversal in the market due to sudden selling by large investors, and the decline was also sharp. After continuous gains, it triggered a recovery. Half of this was due to the sale of actual goods of No. 46, which may have been goods from the financial sector, and half was due to the exit of many retail bulls. As this delivery approached, there were often significant fluctuations due to the relationship between the positions of both parties. According to inquiries, the number of accounts in this month is decreasing day by day. Based on this speculation, if there are no major waves, only the amount outside the market cannot be speculated. The market atmosphere is still not virtual, because the bulls are still mostly swapping. Judging from the rebound in the afternoon, the decline should not be huge. There are many changes in the future, and a sharp drop is not yet the time. When the market opened yesterday morning, retail investors immediately sold. After entering the market, Nos. 46 and 48 became more and more sold off. The recent six months' delivery of Positive Six fell sharply by 7.5 jiao, and the rest also generally loosened. In the next round, large investors did not stop exiting, continuing to fall by 2-3 jiao to about 7 jiao. Only one round of trading was done in the afternoon. Large investors stopped selling, and market prices generally recovered. Nos. 38 and 53 purchased items one by one. The gold short soared by 6.5 jiao, and the rest also rose by 3-4 jiao or more. As a result, market prices generally fell back by 2-3 jiao to about 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 30 million yuan. The results of its gains and losses are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Struggles Under Pressure</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported yesterday (22nd) that the New York stock market was quite idle. In the last hour, due to the brewing labor strike in the rubber industry, rubber stocks were weak. At the same time, Hudson Motor collapsed, and auto stocks were the first to experience a decline. The market was then dragged down by a few cents to four yuan. The market situation leveled off before closing, and some stocks recovered slightly. The small exchange also fell, and bonds were mixed and slightly lower. US Treasury bonds were particularly firm, and foreign bonds had no trend. French 7% bonds rose by more than one yuan, and other gains and losses were minimal. Grains also saw mixed gains and losses. Wheat fell first in the morning, prompting purchases by brokers, and as a result, it was slightly higher than before. The full-day trading volume was 930,000 shares. (Securities) Rumors spread that a certain bull company sold off, and the market was struggling under selling pressure, but there was a slight rebound before closing, which was still a situation manipulated by professional speculation. (Wheat) The market first fell due to rain, and flour mills purchased futures and sold flour, so prices should continue to rise. The weather in the wheat-producing area is cool and rainy, but the rainfall is still insufficient. The drought in Europe is severe, and it is predicted that there will be crop failures in several places. This is why the Liverpool market did not follow the sharp drop in Chicago. Bullock estimates that the amount of harvest in Europe, including the Soviet Union, will be reduced compared to last year as follows: wheat 480 million, barley 330 million, rye 229 million, and oats 360 million. (Corn) Corn and oats have rain in the main producing areas, and the harvest should improve. It is expected that there will be a good opportunity to buy corn in the second half of next week. (Cotton) It fell due to the sale of July futures, poor appetite among traders, and reaction to the stock market. There was a lack of support in the market. The weather in the east is good, but the temperature in Texas is extremely high, which is slightly worrying. Factories received a total of 208,000 bales in one week. (Rubber) The market was calm, and the brewing strike at the Akron factory caused some anxiety. Traders are mostly watching and waiting for the situation to develop. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Fabric Quoted Yarn Shows Another Strong Rise General News is Good, Retail Short Sellers Rush to Cover</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the rise is starting again because the actual demand is good and the northern purchase is still healthy. As a result, the public is very bullish, and there are many who are long in the market and are absorbing a large number of extra shares, refusing to release them. The desire to view high prices has reached its peak. In the afternoon, three-grade yarn rose by 9.9 yuan. As soon as the news improved, the buying trend became more intense, but the amount sold by Japanese merchants was very large.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Rises Strongly by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The open market for Quoted Yarn was calm, but there was a lack of new sellers in the market. Each month rose by 6-7 jiao. When it came to the second or third bidding, I heard that the sales of current yarn were still good. In the</p>
<p>market, retail short sellers rushed to cover, and the market gradually tightened, and each month rose by 1 to 1.1.4.5.7 jiao. In the afternoon, I heard that three-grade yarn rose by 9.9 yuan again, and because it was Saturday, the short sellers rushed to hold straight overnight, and the open market situation was particularly strong. This month rose by 1.1 jiao, and the long-term rose by 6-7 jiao. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 57,100 bales. According to inquiries, the total remaining amount sold was 1,450 bales, Yuzhong 750 bales, Yuanda 700 bales, Tongfeng 1,800 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Changfeng 1,250 bales, Suilong 750 bales, Shenchang 1,000 bales, Yuanfeng 950 bales, Tongxing 650 bales, and Yicheng 650 bales.

<h3>The Market Situation for Quoted Cotton is Relatively Ordinary | The Focus of Speculation is Concentrated on Quoted Yarn |</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending flat, softer than the yarn market, because the delivery of this month is sufficient, the outside cotton is weak, and the focus of general speculators has changed, concentrating on cotton yarn. This is the main reason for the easing of the cotton market. However, the actions of the long companies are slightly more stable, but the situation of new cotton is more expensive than old cotton.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Zheng Biao</h3>
<p>The opening price of the Biao cotton market followed the weakness of foreign cotton and was sluggish. Moreover, due to a large number of deliveries this month, it fell by one jiao. Bids for later months were tighter, and prices rose again in the second and third rounds. The market for new cotton became increasingly firm, resulting in a rise of one and a half to two jiao for each month, except for a five-fen decrease this month. Although the opening price in the afternoon rose, it weakened again in the second and third rounds. As a result, the August contract was flat, and the October and November contracts rose by five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 74,600 dan. Sales included 1,300 dan from Tongfeng, 1,800 dan from Yuanda, 2,400 dan from Shenchang, 1,200 dan from Tongfu, 3,700 dan from Yuanda, 1,100 dan from Junchang, 1,000 dan from Deke, 5,600 dan from Yuanxingchang, 2,500 dan from Tongxing, and 1,000 dan from Shenji. Purchases included 4,500 dan from Tongji, 2,000 dan from Shenchang, 1,000 dan from Xiesheng, 1,100 dan from Xinhua, 3,300 dan from Huikang, 1,000 dan from Gengfeng, 2,800 dan from Changfeng, and 1,500 dan from Xinfeng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>

<h3>Spot Cotton Factory Consumptions Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>Sales of spot cotton were still moderate. The sources included 310 bales of Yao cotton and 305 bales of Tong cotton. The prices of spot cotton were as follows:</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 44.00  Dingxin Factory Purchase 1,000 pieces  Spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 44.25  Dingxin Factory Purchase  200 pieces  Spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 42.75  Zhenxin Factory Purchase 1,000 pieces  Spot delivery to the factory</p>
<h3>Weak American Cotton, Firm British and Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to unfavorable weather, but later weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and a sluggish Wall Street. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 1 to 9 points. British cotton futures rose by 1 to 2 points. Indian cotton was bought by speculators and sold by Japanese traders. As a result, Pingar rose by half a rupee, Omar rose by one and a half rupees, and Bairagi rose by one rupee and two and a half jiao.

<h3>Grains: Rumors of Korean Purchases of Wheat in Shanghai Drive Up Flour and Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and all months showed a consistently strong trend. As the prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada rebounded by about one to two jiao, market sentiment was naturally positive after the opening. Furthermore, the market had not wavered despite a significant decline in foreign wheat prices two days ago, which strengthened the confidence of both internal and external buyers. The limited offerings from major factories led many to speculate about potentially unfavorable actions by short sellers, thus increasing buying interest and driving prices higher. When the market opened in the afternoon, all months remained bullish, partly due to absorption by large long positions and partly due to the prolonged lack of rain. Longs spread rumors of Korean purchases of several hundred bags of wheat, further bolstering their position and increasing buying pressure. It is indeed unimaginable that the market would be so heavily influenced by outsiders after years of good harvests. As a result, the current month rose by two fen, July and August rose by two fen and seven li half, September rose by three fen, October rose by two fen and seven li half, and November rose by two fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the prices for each month were generally stable. As the price of foreign wheat rebounded by only one to two jiao in Chicago and Canada, people did not pay much attention after the opening, and the prices for each month did not fluctuate much. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, there was a sudden and severe surge due to the rising flour market and widespread rumors that Korea was buying wheat in Shanghai. However, upon investigation, the quantity was only three to four hundred bags. In terms of location, it would be much more convenient to purchase in the north if there was a need. The industry insiders generally believe that the activity in Shanghai is a result of manipulation by the long positions. However, with this rumor, the market was greatly disturbed. From the opening to the closing, the price rose steadily. While the country is experiencing a good harvest, the only thing lacking is temporary rain, and people are unnecessarily disturbing themselves. If this situation continues, it may open a door for foreign wheat again. As a result, July rose by six fen, August rose by nine fen, September rose by eight fen, October rose by six fen, and November rose by nine fen. The spot wheat market was generally average. Special high-quality goods were slightly better by two or three fen. Guan Xuzhou wheat was priced at 2.99 yuan, Bengbu Mingguang wheat at 2.95 yuan, Liuhe Wuyi wheat at 2.85 yuan, Daqiao Yangzhou wheat at 2.82-3 yuan, Zhitang Penglai wheat at 2.78 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 2.76-7 yuan, Pukou wheat at 2.77 yuan, secondary at 2.75 yuan, Taizhou wheat at 2.84 yuan, Anqing wheat at 2.76 yuan, secondary at 2.73 yuan. Fuxin purchased 5,000 bags, Fufeng purchased 5,000 bags, and Xinda and Huafeng each purchased 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Limited Arrival of Hexia Rice, Price Up by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs became scarcer again, with only seventeen or eighteen boats arriving (a total of 2,600 to 2,700 shi). Among them, thick japonica rice was even scarcer, with only three or four boats. Therefore, sentiment in the street was upward, and the shops were quite bullish, competing to buy for fear of being too late. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, and the market situation seemed to soar into the sky in an instant. As a result, the prices of regular gangs such as Su Tong and Nan Gang all rose by two or three jiao. As for the various gangs of late rice, the merchants from other regions started their purchases from the opening of the market. The merchants from Beiyang, Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and other places were also quite interested. It is estimated that one boatload of Qingjiao goods was transacted, and the rest was abandoned. The situation for Dujian also showed some movement, rising by five fen, while Yangjian remained stable. Bianyuan sales were still good, and prices continued to rise by a jiao or so.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various routes in Hexia totaled fourteen or fifteen boats, and the Hexia inventory was one hundred thirty or forty boats. The sales of various goods such as white japonica early thin rice were discouraged, and Yang Dujian slightly improved. The wharves were exchanging sharp white rice at par. The market price of white japonica rice increased by two or three jiao, early thin rice increased by two jiao, Yang Dujian tightened by about one jiao, and wharves tip tightened by several fen. Customer tips and Baiyuan stood firm.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Sells Well, Price is High</h3>
<p>▲ Strong Stomach for Domestic and Fuzhou Shipments</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market was initially stable. However, because the Fuzhou gang was still greedy for stomach, and new domestic gangs and Zhejiang Wenzhou and Taizhou gangs arrived in the market, the market immediately saw an upward trend. The domestic gangs' appetite for stomach was no less than that of Fuzhou, and the local street also actively participated in purchases, so the market immediately showed an upward trend. Domestic gangs had not had a strong stomach for a long time. Now, due to the prolonged drought, farmland cannot be planted, and domestic rice prices and sentiment are trending upwards, so they are eager to purchase in Shanghai. Trading customers also took the opportunity to buy. Because the supply of goods is currently light, the market is rising accordingly. However, the market inventory is still sufficient. The activity of domestic gangs is temporary in nature, unlike the long-term nature of the Fuzhou gang. The current rice inventory is sufficient to meet the needs, and the market price is not easy to rise significantly. Only the high-quality rice in the market is not much, so various high-quality brown rice and machine-milled Xian rice have risen by five fen to nearly a jiao. The total daily sales of various Xian rice was 7,422 bags. In addition to the 1,200 bags purchased by the local street and Zhejiang gangs, the rest was distributed by the Min and domestic gangs.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Tax Reduction News Affects the Sugar Market</h3>
<p>▲ Sales of Blue, Red, and White Sugar Halt Uniformly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced frequent declines in customs gold, and rumors of a potential tax reduction on foreign sugar, which had been circulating for days, became increasingly rampant. As a result, sales of blue, red, and white sugar all came to a standstill. Sellers feared a dramatic change in market prices and mostly remained on the sidelines, rendering the public association's pricing efforts almost useless. The market calls yesterday were also extremely chaotic, with the highest bid at 20.5 yuan and the lowest at 20.3 yuan. There were also rumors of secret deals at lower prices, but these could not be confirmed. In short, everyone was confused by the talk of tax reductions. However, it is difficult to say whether the tax reduction will actually be implemented, and all parties are secretly exploring the situation. As for the domestic Chaoqing sugar, the inventory is indeed thin, and sales are still long. Even if the foreign sugar tax reduction is implemented, it will not have much impact, because the current market price is not high, and it is difficult for foreign sugar to be cheaper than domestic sugar even with a tax reduction. As for Hainan red sugar from Guangdong, because the sugar tax there has already been contracted, and there are plans to implement an agricultural tax increase on the 18th, most of the sugar in that area has been transferred to Hong Kong and loaded onto the Xinjiang ship, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling more than 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Orchid Seeds Show Signs of Crop Failure</h3>
<p>▲ Old Goods Suddenly Rise in Price</p>
<p>According to a letter from Zhangzhou, the current state of new orchid flowers indicates a crop failure. The harvest this year may only be 10% of the usual yield. As a result, the market price of old goods has suddenly tightened. For top-quality all-yellow goods, Shanghai brokers are already willing to pay a high price of 50 yuan. Therefore, the merchants have wired the local area to ship the goods, and they may arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Black Tea Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Since the new tea from Qimen, Fuliang, Ningzhou, and other regions was released, sales have been exceptionally rapid. Although the market price had fallen repeatedly due to the congestion of arrivals, the Russian Cooperative Foreign Firm has recently been actively purchasing large quantities due to favorable tea prices, and the market has become more stable. It is estimated that 45,000 boxes of Qifu black tea have been sold, accounting for 70% of the total. The floral fragrance variety is sold as soon as it arrives, and the market price has risen to 34-35 yuan, which is unprecedented in recent years. The black tea market has shown a stable outlook.</p>

<h3>Amateur Consumer Cooperative</h3>
<p>— Taoran</p>
<p>The world economic panic is deepening day by day. The weakness of general purchasing power and the increasing unemployment rate not only have not subsided, but have further expanded rapidly and extensively every day. Needless to say, we ordinary citizens are "bearing the brunt," especially we salary-earning class in the professional field, who are most likely to be drawn into the vortex of this economic panic crisis first.</p>
<p>We are now standing precariously on the tip of an economic panic volcano!</p>
<p>Therefore, we have no doubt that on the eve of this panic crisis descending upon us, we cannot afford to be ignorant. How should we prepare in advance to cope with the terrible crisis that is about to befall us?</p>
<p>So here, I offer an effective method to our comrades in the salary-earning class of the professional world:</p>
<p>In 1844, in Rochdale, England, a group of flannel factory workers jointly organized a consumer cooperative. Their business was: (1) to set up a cooperative store to supply the daily necessities of the members; (2) to build or purchase public dormitories to provide accommodation for the members; (3) to manufacture consumer goods for the members, accommodating unemployed members; (4) to rent or purchase land to provide unemployed members with cultivation; (5) to establish temperance societies to promote abstinence from alcohol.</p>
<p>Summarizing their business, we can see that it has at least the following benefits: (1) Because the profits from the cooperative store can still be distributed to the members according to their purchases, there is no waste in consumption, which can save expenses and increase the purchasing power of the members; (2) Because there are manufacturing and farming production businesses, unemployed and jobless members can temporarily avoid the panic in life caused by unemployment; (3) Having public dormitories can create close relationships between the families of the members and provide opportunities for cooperation and mutual assistance; (4) The rules on abstaining from smoking and drinking mean that people with bad habits and bad behavior cannot join the cooperative, which indirectly improves social morals and bad customs.</p>
<p>In fact, the effectiveness of consumer cooperatives does not stop at these points. In addition to improving human economic life and social systems, it can also train autonomy, increase organizational skills, support educational effectiveness, and develop cultural undertakings under collective action. Therefore, after the establishment of the Rochdale Consumer Cooperative, various places scrambled to imitate it and organized collectively. Up to now, the number of consumer cooperatives worldwide has exceeded 200,000, with more than 140 million members. This astonishingly high-speed development is unmatched by any social movement in the world. However, in our country, which is the most backward in accepting world trends, the cooperative movement has only had considerable development in rural areas, while in urban areas, it is silent and unheard of, and even if there is, it is only as rare as morning stars!</p>
<p>The tide of the world economic panic is already rolling like a flood under our feet. Our purchasing power is weakening day by day, and the panic of unemployment is constantly jumping around us. Our current position is exactly like that of the Rochdale workers in 1844. Our environment has the urgent need to organize consumer cooperatives. We really need to stand up immediately to organize amateur consumer cooperatives!</p>
<p>The business we can do at present is: (1) cooperative stores to supply our daily consumer goods to save expenses; (2) public dormitories to provide our accommodation, reducing many wastes and troubles in renting alone; (3) public entertainment venues and entertainment rooms to provide our amateur appropriate entertainment and recreation; (4) public libraries to provide our academic cultivation and enrich our own strength; (5) and various other public undertakings that we deem necessary to hold.</p>
<p>Comrades of the professional world who live on salaries: We should recognize the crisis we are facing, and we should stand up immediately to do some preparatory work. For society and for ourselves, we cannot delay any longer.</p>
<p>We should stand up immediately to organize amateur consumer cooperatives!</p>

<h3>(Fairy) (Cave)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ningna</p>
<p>Every time I pass by the XX Women and Children Relief Society, and occasionally catch a glimpse of several yellow and thin children through the narrow half-open door, my heart feels as if it is being pressed down by something heavy. It is the unspeakable human sympathy that evokes the sadness. This heavy sadness has been pressing on my heart for several years, and I have not forgotten it for a moment, especially when I see those little lives struggling in the same miserable fate. Maybe that day is coming soon! These large numbers of suffering orphans will jump out of the deathly terrifying circle and walk into the great "life road"! I hope so.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is also an orphanage founded by several well-known philanthropists. In addition to accommodating orphans like other charitable organizations, it also opened up an orphanage park by taking advantage of the natural beauty. The park does not occupy a large area, but it is characterized by the abundance of flowers, especially chrysanthemums. Every autumn, there is always a chrysanthemum art fair lasting for several days, using different kinds of bright chrysanthemums to form various flower mountains, flower forests, and even flower stories. At the same time, wonderful performances are held in the chrysanthemum industry. Cultivating those flowers and plants and repairing the park are the work of the accommodated orphans. Usually, each person has to buy a ticket to visit there, and the price of the ticket is one dime (it is said that the money is used by the authorities to install equipment related to the health of the orphans), but if you want to see the "miracle" inside, you have to pay a special fee.</p>
<p>In the park, near the orphans' dormitories, there are two small hills facing each other in the east and west, with a dark cave at the bottom of each hill. This is the so-called "miracle." (And the park, or even the orphanage, is probably opened for this "miracle," I think.) Legend has it that they are "Royal Sealed Caves" left over from the Qin Shihuang era. Because many ancient bottles, ancient coins, ancient swords, and the like have been unearthed there, the two dark caves have been valued and treasured, and two iron gates have been artificially manufactured and sealed at the entrance of the cave. The inside has been constantly going down and the sloping earth slope has been replaced with stone slopes. Because they are relics left by a generation of heroes, everyone is eager to "see it for themselves" and scramble to look at the "miracle." The income of six copper coins per person is said to be considerable, but that was at the beginning. Later, as time went by, the "miracle" was forgotten, and the two caves became the nests of snakes. At some point, a rumor suddenly spread that a "Lingzhi grass" had grown in the eastern cave. Lingzhi grass is a fairy seed, and the cave has simply become a "Fairy Cave." Therefore, the weeds growing all over the way, tourists' footsteps are full again.</p>
<p>Regardless of the origin of the "fairy grass," the orphanage authorities' hard work for this exceptional business is evident. Next, let's look at the place's owner, the orphans' whole life:</p>
<p>The earth revolves around the sun eternally, and the work of the orphans there is the same from morning to night without stopping. As soon as it dawns, they climb down their small plank beds (the beds are made of wooden frames and divided into four layers, those who sleep on the second layer and above must use a ladder to climb up and down) and start their morning work, such as watering flowers and weeding. Breakfast is just thin millet porridge, limited to two bowls per person. In the morning, they are divided into classes like elementary school students. Lunch and dinner are the same coarse rice with side dishes, and the quantity is the same as breakfast. The entire afternoon is when they participate in production. Some weave rattan ware, some weave bamboo ware, some weave towels. Within a limited time, each child must complete a certain amount, otherwise, they will be beaten or starved. Even a six-year-old child does not have the good fortune to escape the strict rules. Therefore, the production is increasing day by day, and it is also easy to sell. Looking at the situation, the income from the goods is probably several times the orphans' consumption.</p>
<p>Most of the orphans are sent by relatives without parents, and the procedures for entering the hospital are very complicated. After finding a "solid" guarantor, you also have to find a letter of introduction from a powerful person before the child can enter. Some also have mothers, but the mothers are unable to support the children, so they entrust someone to send them in, but the procedures are more troublesome than the former, and sometimes they have to spend some money.</p>

<h3>Sibling Company</h3>
<p>— Fu Lan</p>
<p>On the eve of the outbreak of the European War, a 53-year-old small tea merchant died in Seaford, England. His will entrusted the business to his daughter. At that time, Miss Eliza Baker was just a teenager, with no understanding of business or the ways of the world. Everyone expected this small business to close down for good. Who knew that she would shoulder this burden and struggle against the environment with her two younger brothers, who were still in school. Today, this small business has expanded into the well-known Baker Limited, with an annual turnover of about 10 million Chinese dollars. This is truly an inspiring story.</p>
<p>When these three siblings inherited their father's small business, they specialized in packaging tea, renting two cellars in a Methodist church. The place was dark, the air was foul, it was practically hell. Later, Miss Baker married Mr. Gaskin and abandoned the tea packaging business, switching to packaging dried green peas, which proved to be even more profitable. So she rented a better room and started her business. When the war ended, her two brothers joined her in her work.</p>
<p>A young woman and two students who had just left school were sitting in the office. Outsiders would never believe that they were the main figures controlling the entire business. Once, a customer came in and said to Mrs. Gaskin, "May I see anyone?" "Sure, you can see me," she said. "Yes, but I want to see someone who knows business," the customer earnestly requested.</p>
<p>Because of their young age, they did not look like important figures in the business, especially her younger brother, who was often mistaken for an office boy by outsiders. Therefore, they had to hire an older person to be their nominal manager. So they worked together, and the business grew day by day, until three years ago. From then on, they began to experiment with making canned green peas, with the three siblings working together. They first sent their manager to the scientist who invented the manufacturing method to study for three days. But in the end, no one told them how to use this new invention. They had to assemble a small model machine for making canned green peas, and the three siblings, together with their manager, discussed and experimented day and night, hoping to discover the secret of manufacturing. They had no expert guidance, and they did everything themselves.</p>
<p>So they accumulated a large sum of money and built a new factory. Their hard-earned savings were almost entirely invested in this uncertain new venture. If they failed, their fate would be sealed, so everyone worked even harder and more cautiously. In the first week they started manufacturing, orders from all over the place flew in like snowflakes, piling up on Mrs. Gaskin's desk, more than a foot high. The machines ran day and night to meet the enthusiastic needs of customers. The three siblings stood by the machines from morning till night, rarely having time to sleep. Batch after batch of their products were shipped out in bundles before they had time to cool down, to meet the needs of their customers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gaskin went to the warehouse every day to inspect the green peas. She also often went to Lincolnshire to visit farmers, inspect the planting of green peas, manage the machines, supervise the printing, and take care of general affairs. She was practically doing the work of several people and never had a moment to spare.</p>
<p>They are now planning to build another new factory from next year to manufacture other canned fruits and vegetables, hoping to achieve an annual turnover of about 15 million Chinese dollars.</p>
<p>Everyone believes that the poor orphans are enjoying a very prosperous life, but who knows that this is just an illusion? The children are suffering inside, and the heavy manual labor is devouring their innocent and lively nature. There are no rosy, round cheeks to be found, only thin, yellow faces and scabby scalps. Sores are studded all over their frog-like, weak bodies. No one lets out a loud laugh, and no one dares to utter a lovely cry. And the teacher, who is like a prison guard, has never shown them a gentle expression. The lonely little souls are suffering in the 　 palace....</p>
<p>Once, a child was allowed by the teacher to meet his mother in the parlor. The mother looked at his bloodless face in amazement, and the child meekly accepted the unfamiliar caress. The mother began to cry sadly, not knowing what she was thinking, and the child reached out his small hand to tell his mother: The teacher had beaten him with a wooden stick in the morning. Coincidentally, their teacher walked past the door, immediately drove the mother away, severely beat the talkative child, and then locked him in a dark room to starve.</p>
<p>Mothers outside no longer laugh happily, and children inside no longer want to work miserably. When they see the wealthy children wearing new clothes and following their wealthy fathers, jumping and laughing in the park through the cracks in the bamboo fence on a beautiful day, what a powerful stimulus that is for them! 　　 Things finally happened. Two children, taking advantage of the teacher's carelessness, ran away from the mountain behind the courtyard, but were caught by the teacher not far away. It is said that the punishment was particularly severe that time. After being beaten violently, they were sent to the "Fairy Cave" for solitary confinement. The children were crying and shouting as they were thrown in. By the time they were dragged out, the children were silent. The youngest, who was only six years old, lost his suffering little life in the "Fairy Cave," and the nine-year-old had only one last breath left....</p>
<p>The earth revolves around the sun eternally, and the children suffer eternally in the orphanage. The orphanage, surrounded by the light of charity, exists eternally.</p>

<h3>Soviet Water Happiness Society</h3>
<p>— Fusheng</p>
<p>The public organ for developing water transport and water rescue 丨Water Happiness Society (Osvod)丨has been reorganized from the former Water Relief Society. The latter was solely focused on water rescue and had a total of 48,000 members.</p>
<p>The Water Happiness Society was rebuilt and established in 1931. Its articles of association and detailed rules are completely different from those of the former Water Relief Society. Its goals have been newly revised; it connects itself with the rest of the country and strives for socialist construction in the same way. Its main work is to help the development of water transport, encourage the construction of small boats, and train sailors and drivers, etc.　　The achievements of the past two years of activities have shown that the goals it has adopted are correct. Now it has a total of 500,000 members, and most of them are very active members. Three thousand local branches have been established in the past two years. Most of these branches are located in working-class communities near water areas.</p>
<p>In a revolutionary anniversary festival in 1932, the association held a mass parade. There were 400 kinds of achievement reports in line with the association's activity goals, and the lively water sports held at the same time attracted 1.5 million 　spectators.</p>
<p>In the struggle for ship repair, the association mobilized 250 teams to participate, repairing a total of 175 giant ships. In order to save material waste and increase the speed of ship repair, a work to improve the education and technical level of members has been carried out.</p>
<p>During the spring and summer seasons suitable for navigation, the association made the greatest effort to utilize all the ships to their full effect. The ships belonging to the association carried a total of 2.5 million passengers during that period, including collective farmers carrying goods to the city.</p>
<p>Printed propaganda materials were also used extensively. In 1932, it printed 25 kinds of popular pamphlets discussing its various activities. It also printed 18 kinds of art advertisements, each in large quantities, instructing the public on how to save a person drowning in the water, how to save fuel, how to avoid grounding and hitting reefs, etc.</p>
<p>At docks and shipyards, the association spends a total of 65 million rubles each year to build small wooden boats and various types of ships (such as speedboats, steamships, lifeboats, ice-skating boats, etc.), and another 2 million rubles to equip various appliances on the ships. About 3,000 graduates have graduated from the crash courses organized by the association. After passing theoretical and practical work, they have been employed as regular water transport sailors and boatmen.</p>

<h3>Introducing "Vocational Life" Bi-Monthly Magazine</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>I accidentally bought the inaugural issue of the "Vocational Life" bi-monthly magazine at a newsstand. After reading it, it aroused my excited sympathy and resonance. Here I should sincerely introduce it to our shop assistants.</p>
<p>First of all, we must understand that this publication is not a garden for literati and elegant people to show off their style, nor is it a tool for vocational educators to teach and deceive us. It is purely painstakingly founded by several young people in the vocational world, so its appearance is not an accidental trick, as stated in the inaugural message: "From the name of this publication, you can realize that it is for people in the vocational world... In the current tense situation, the bankruptcy of the countryside, the sharpness of imperialist aggression, and the economic panic have led to massive unemployment of shop assistants, and those who are employed are also feeling the pressure of unemployment panic at all times... Under the oppression of material things, in order to solve our urgent and serious problems, in order to uncover the darkness of the vocational world and expose the tragic lives of vocational youth, to awaken the self-awareness and progress of the entire lower-level shop assistant masses..." Undoubtedly, it is a child of the times. It was produced in the current severe era. Shop assistants have begun to issue the first cry in history. What kind of encouragement and comfort is this cry to the wounded hearts of our shop assistant masses?</p>
<p>In order to complete its declared mission, to match the painful tone of our lives, the development of the content is realistic, fully showing a resolute and strong warrior's face. There is no frivolous laughter, no boring talk, no mysterious academic theories, no hypocritical embellishment of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but the truth of explaining the sins of the present society, revealing the bloodstains and tears of our lives, and reflecting the ferocious face of the vocational world. For example, in the vocational communication column "Our Lives," in this communication, a</p>
<p>The fragile and tragic heart of a young apprentice in a glass factory pours out his wailing for his living environment and sheds tears of sympathy for a companion who suffers innocently. At their young age, they lost their mother's love due to economic oppression and suffered the punishment of life under the iron whip of the economy. No wonder he asked suspiciously: "Did we bring sin from our mother's womb?" The communication "In the Silk Factory" objectively narrates the oppression and destruction of female workers by foremen, writing out the tragic facts that the author himself witnessed. Look! He lamented so much: "Every day, every day, I see countless ignorant female workers being trampled on and despised by those gentlemen who call themselves the management class; every day, every day, I see pure and innocent girls rushing out of the dilapidated countryside and throwing themselves into this machine that produces profits and exploits the surplus value of laborers, and one by one they are buried in the tomb; every day, every day, I also see boxes and boxes of silk being exported in exchange for thousands of dollars; every bright silk is stained with the blood, tears, and sweat of the laborers, but the people who wear silk feel very comfortable and relaxed." This scene aroused his infinite indignation and aimless hesitation. He deeply felt disappointed with his occupation, and a young man with ambition shed tears in this iron prison of life. "The Crippled Body" in the literary and artistic creation column (not yet completed in this issue) realistically describes a bank clerk who develops lung disease due to overwork. When he can no longer devote himself to bank affairs, the bank authorities kick him out like a leather ball. I am sorry that I do not have time to introduce the other works one by one.</p>
<p>Based on my observations, I believe that this is a good reading material for our shop assistant masses. As long as we are a shop assistant, everyone admits that it is our common tongue and mouth, conveying our common pent-up anger and resentment. It is the pioneer of our thoughts, leading us to judge truth and deception. It is the garden of our knowledge, cultivating our knowledge to move forward. Therefore, this publication is worth introducing here.</p>
<p>The magazine is priced at two cents per issue and four dimes per year. It is sold in major bookstores and newsstands. I am attaching this introduction.</p>
<p>The two rivers of Gamma), has now gradually recovered; the ships destroyed in those years have now been rebuilt. The construction in this area has grown significantly since 1929. The number of lifeboats has increased from 371 in 1929 to 961 in 1933, most of which are newly built. The number of lifesaving equipment has increased from 1,141 in 1929 to 2,249 in 1933. In 1932, 93 percent of the total number of people who encountered danger in the water were rescued.</p>
<p>With a basic understanding of lifesaving work, the association has formulated a budget to solicit an investment of 40 million rubles for more effective development in the future, which will be used to build and repair various lifesaving water equipment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this association is to realize the following slogan: "Never have a water casualty!" All lifesaving work is based on the concept of realizing this goal.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Decline in Teachers' Status</h3>
<p>— Zai Lian</p>
<p>The decline in teachers' status in society is an undeniable fact. We don't need to quote classics and allusions. Just mentioning a few of the nicknames for teachers is enough to prove it. Such as "Monkey King" and "Schoolteacher" all contain derogatory meanings. So why are teachers despised? The reasons are: First, because of the teachers' miserable life. Nowadays, people generally measure other people's abilities based on the amount of money they earn. Teachers' work is heavy, and teachers' remuneration is very low. Some monthly incomes are less than ten yuan, and a position with twenty to thirty yuan is considered rare. At most, it cannot exceed forty yuan. In today's rising cost of living, it is often felt that "eight bottles have only seven caps" to control this small amount. If you can afford rice, you don't have money to buy firewood. Teachers have no choice but to save money and use it sparingly. If you encounter years of salary cuts and arrears, there is no second way to go except to tighten your belts and wait for death to come.</p>
<p>The second is that there are no strict restrictions on teacher qualifications. "People's trouble is that they like to be teachers." The importance of the responsibility of being a teacher can be imagined. But even so, there are still many people who do not understand what education is, and who teach and gesticulate in the classroom with arrogance, so that the achievements of education are not worth hearing. There are also profit-seeking merchants who have suffered economic changes and lost their jobs, and have also entered the education sector. Regardless of Zhang San and Li Si, as long as they have a little knowledge, they can enter the education sector, which makes the education sector more complex. A certain celebrity said that teachers are as numerous as dog hair, which is also true. However, it is too harsh to compare teachers who are engaged in sacred careers to dog hair.</p>
<p>The third is that teachers' positions are not guaranteed. The life of a teacher can be said to be a short-lived life. The term of validity of the contracts of some schools is one semester, and that of others is one academic year. When the contract expires, those who are confident that they can renew can temporarily feel at ease. The standard for renewal naturally depends on the principal's feelings for you, and there is no so-called guarantee of a "service regulations" at all. If there is no hope of renewal, then you have to attack other schools again. If the attack fails, there will be the threat of unemployment. The unemployment of the</p>

<h3>Agricultural Laborers in Spain</h3>
<p>— Naifu</p>
<p>Recent foreign dispatches report that 150,000 tenant farmers in Spain have launched a massive strike. "Fighting with local militias is occurring everywhere, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. They would rather let the abundant harvest, unseen in fifty years, rot in the fields than accept the employers' demands. Their strike declaration states: 'We have endured hunger and starvation for two years. Even further deprivation is commonplace.'" (See Shen Bao, June 10th). What a heroic and poignant cry!</p>
<p>We know that Spain is an agricultural country. Of its 20 million people, about 7.5 million are employed, and those engaged in agriculture account for more than 50% of the total employed population. However, the concentration of land is unparalleled in the world. 67% of all cultivated land belongs to 2% of the population, who are large landowners owning more than 100 hectares. Conversely, 76.5% of landowners with less than 5 hectares (1 million people) own only 7.4% of the total cultivated land. This situation can be seen in the table below.</p>

<p>Agricultural relations in Spain are characterized by the prevalence of tenant farming, with feudal exploitation still persisting. Most of the two million agricultural laborers have no land at all and rely entirely on daily wages to survive. In a sense, agricultural laborers are an intermediate layer between farmers and the proletariat, because small farmers are increasingly becoming agricultural laborers due to heavy exploitation, while agricultural laborers themselves constantly wander between rural and urban areas in search of work.</p>
<p>Since the World War, Spain has been permanently mired in an agricultural crisis, and peasant revolutions and unrest are almost constantly heard. The peasant movement of 1919 reached its climax, with the Spanish government reporting as many as 160 tenant farmer strikes that year. Needless to say, these strikes were mainly led by agricultural laborers. Moreover, each strike is united with the movement of industrial laborers, and there are often mutual support strikes. Especially since 1929, the raging tide of the global economic crisis has intensified Spain's agricultural crisis, which has plunged Spanish farmers, especially agricultural laborers, into a more miserable situation, forcing them to launch a vigorous liberation struggle with a resolve to die.</p>
<p>Unemployment among agricultural laborers is a chronic phenomenon, and wage levels are extremely low. Moreover, the period of employment for agricultural laborers per year is very limited, generally limited to planting and seasonal work. This reflects the temporal characteristics of the Spanish agricultural movement. The average wage for agricultural laborers in Andalusia in 1931 was 3 to 4 pesetas. The average number of working days for agricultural laborers in that region is only 200 to 250 days per year, so the total annual income is only 700 to 900 pesetas. An income of 1,000 pesetas is extremely rare. Therefore, based on 365 days, the average daily wage is only about 2 to 2.5 pesetas. This is not even enough to cover the living expenses of a single bachelor, let alone supporting parents and raising a wife and children.</p>
<p>The working hours of agricultural laborers are very long, and working extended hours, up to 12-14 hours, is extremely common. As for the abuse of child labor and female labor, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>The agricultural crisis has worsened the state of agricultural laborers. First, unemployment has increased and the population has decreased. Second, nominal prices have risen, especially the nominal prices of necessities, which directly affect agricultural laborers because they are not sellers of agricultural products but only buyers. In the summer and autumn of 1931, agricultural laborers went on strike to force large landowners to raise nominal wages, but the large landowners further increased the nominal prices of necessities. As a result, the real wages of laborers actually decreased.</p>
<p>However, the rise in nominal prices of agricultural products is not only unfavorable to agricultural laborers but also of no benefit to poor and middle farmers. Due to the particularity of Spanish farmers' crops (grapes being the main agricultural product), they generally have to sell their crops before they are ripe to repay debts, pay taxes, and purchase necessities for agricultural management. They are fundamentally in an unfavorable position in terms of sales. Moreover, the plight of poor and middle farmers is exacerbated by tenant farming relationships. Large landowners often act arbitrarily and abuse their power. Whenever the lease term expires, they always arbitrarily increase the deposit and raise the rent, completely disregarding the value added by tenant farmers' labor on the cultivated land.</p>
<p>Regarding the farmers' poverty and destitution, we do not have statistical reports at hand, so let us cite some real-life examples.</p>
<p>Let us look at the situation in the two counties of Lorca and Águilas in the province of Murcia. Droughts plague them every year, and no crops can grow without artificial irrigation. However, the irrigation system in these counties has completely collapsed. This has forced the agriculture of this province (mainly grape cultivation) to decline, especially in the aforementioned two counties. In seven years, the agricultural population of Lorca County has decreased from 80,000 to 50,000. The agricultural population of Águilas County has decreased by 90%. Wine production in the two counties has decreased from 53,000 hectoliters in 1918 to 2,000 hectoliters in 1932. The total value of agricultural products has decreased from 35,000 pesetas to 23,000 pesetas. Year after year, tens of thousands of farmers who are uneasy about their livelihoods flow into cities, demanding relief, work, and bread. Examples like this are common throughout Spain.</p>

<p>no one esteems the teacher.</p>
<p>Fourth, contradictory phenomena in society cause teachers to completely lose their faith. Children hear great principles from teachers, but when they look at the objective environment in society, many situations are completely contrary to what the teachers say. Children's faith in teachers cannot help but waver at first, and eventually they become skeptical. For example, superstition does not help to save the country. This is something that children often hear from their teachers, and they certainly believe it to be true. But the reality that falls before their eyes is that some people are advocating chanting scriptures in the region, and teachers are even urging them to participate in this movement. Children's young minds cannot help but feel disgusted by the contradiction between the teachers' words and deeds. As for the fact that teachers are afraid of breaking their rice bowls and have to cater to the psychology of their superiors, that is why they teach them to do this, this is something they do not know, and even if they knew, they could not sympathize with it.</p>
<p>Combining the above reasons, it is simply impossible to prevent the decline of the teacher's position! Children are the pillars of the future country, and teachers have the responsibility to make this pillar firm. Since teachers bear a heavy responsibility, they should not be despised by others. This has become a natural and righteous principle. As for the teacher's own cultivation, that is also important. Teachers are the ideal object for children, and every move of the teacher can affect the child's behavior. Teachers' words and deeds should be consistent. If they say something, they should do it. Only in this way can they gain the faith of children, make teaching easier, and only in this way can the education career have hope of dawn.</p>

<p>Scientific Miscellany</p>
<h3>The Story of the Invention of the Airship for Saving the Country Through Aviation (3)</h3>
<p>— Shulin</p>
<p>In 1766, the famous British chemist Cavendish discovered hydrogen, which is much lighter than air. This was a major revolution in the world of balloons.</p>
<p>After that, Dr. Edenburg Pollock began to make balloons filled with hydrogen. The doctor put hydrogen into ox intestines, but failed due to excessive weight. After the discovery of hydrogen, no one used it for a while.</p>
<p>After several years, the French Montgolfier brothers experimented with making balloons. The elder brother was named Stanford, and the younger brother was named Joshua. They originally worked in a paper shop in the Annonay district and accidentally came up with the idea of making balloons. Interestingly, the invention of balloons and airplanes was often successful due to the cooperation of brothers. The invention of the Zeppelin airship by Zeppelin and his brother Haberth, and the invention of the Wright airplane, are all facts of successful cooperation between brothers. The Montgolfier brothers thought that they could make a large bag with many pieces of paper and fill it with smoke to rise into the sky.</p>
<p>The brothers discussed and made a large paper bag, which was extremely convenient in the paper shop. They took the bag to the center of the courtyard and lit dry grass under it.</p>
<p>The brothers laughed happily. The paper bag filled with smoke and left the brothers' hands and rose. They looked up and sat down, clapping and cheering. They were naturally happy that their design had been successful. But at that time, the bag did not rise because it was filled with smoke, but because it was heated by the air and became lighter, it was carried up.</p>
<p>Then the Montgolfier brothers made a second large balloon, which expanded into a circle with a diameter of 30 feet.</p>
<p>On June 5, 1783, this balloon was scheduled to be released in Annonay Square. Thousands of people gathered after hearing the news. Montgolfier's balloon rose quietly towards the clear space. The audience cheered in unison, and the brothers' elation can be imagined. As a result, it undoubtedly achieved great success at the time. The balloon rose one and a half miles, and after the air inside gradually cooled, it slowly descended.</p>
<p>Montgolfier's balloon at that time, of course, could not carry cargo or passengers.</p>
<p>The success of the brothers gave everyone a great stimulus, and the number of people manufacturing balloons suddenly increased. In August of that year, the famous scientist Aim, Quers and the Robert brothers made a balloon. The outer skin of the balloon was made of thin silk coated with rubber, and it was filled with hydrogen. (To be continued)</p>
