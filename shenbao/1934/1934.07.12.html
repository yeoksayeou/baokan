<h3>提倡國貨運動有擴大之必要經</h3>
<p>近數年來。我國的產業。顯露極度衰落的狀態。其他姑且不說。僅就棉織一業而論。已足够我們驚心動魄了。據最近華商紗廠聯合會年報的統計。上海爲全國紗銷的中心。如以民國十九年爲基數（一○○）作上海最近四年市塲客帮的現銷指數。那末。二十年度只及十九年度百分之七十八。二十一年度只及百分之五十二。二十二年度只及百分之三十五。紗銷如此步步降跌。自然是反映着腹地社會購買力的收縮。同時。也是反映着上海棉織業近來已遇着極嚴重的生產過剩的危機。所以紗廠聯合會的報吿書中又說。「總計全國生產减率。仍與百分之二十三相近。然以國内紗銷情形言之。雖有此减率。生產仍苦過剩。存紗增多之趨勢。初未稍戢。」棉織業如此。其他各產業亦難以維持例外的發展。所以就一般情形觀察。我國產業之亟待援救。實已無可諱言。</p>
<p>全國產業旣已陷落至如此地步。最應提倡的援救方法是什麽呢。我們以爲還要算目前風行全國。以金融界爲領導的「國貨運動」了。說到國貨運動的成敗。有下列幾點特别値得我們注意。（一）在國貨運動的現階段中。雖以產運銷三者的全作相號召。但運銷二者仍居主要地位。不無有畸形發展的遺憾。（二）過去金融界對於國貨運動的援助。不能謂爲不盡力。但尚未能從生產技術方面加以改進。（三）國貨運動以刺激國民對於本國產業生產品的消費爲目的。同時也就是促進本國產業資本擴張的一個方法。但不是唯一的方法。按照現狀。能否就足以解决目前全國產業界所處的困難地位呢。這答案當然是否定的。我們如果希望國貨運動能够「百尺竿頭更進一步。」便當承認其内容還有加以充實和擴大的必要。</p>
<p>國貨運動的内容。應該加以如何的充實和擴大呢。我們根據目前的實際需要。以爲其間的基本條件。不當、限於運銷的進步。和金融界對於運銷的合作。而必當爲生產成本的减輕。至少必較洋商或在華外廠的成本爲輕。否則所謂國貨運動。不但不能收到若何成效。且不易使金融界與產業界之間。維持健全的關係。至降輕生產成本的方法。可以分兩方面進行。第一·是生產技術的改進。所謂生產技術的改進。係以减輕每商品單位的「工繳」成本爲目的。但以目前產業疲敝的程度而言。生產技術的改進。有關於大量資本的投放。自然難以實現。但仍須認爲發揚國貨運動的主要辦法。第二·是稅則的調節。若政府能把關稅和内地稅（如統稅之類）聯合運用而得其當。則不但可以减輕外貨的傾銷。調節原料品的價格。而且可以直接引起成本的低落。卽如經營棉織業的外廠與華廠。對於統稅的擔負。向無差别。如能變動統稅稅則而施行退稅方法。那就無異於直接减輕華廠的負擔。又如關稅一項。如能重徵進口疋頭。而减輕生棉的入口稅。亦就足以維持華廠出品的競銷力量。而使其成本减輕。總之。稅則的變動。雖非一種永久的辦法。但有時爲保護本國市塲。低减本國生產品的成本起見。是很有作用的。</p>
<p>國貨運動的勝利。旣以輕减成本爲基本條件。而輕减成本。又須從改進生產技術和調節稅率雙方着手。凡政府和產業界所應努力的方針。盡在於此了。若只知高唱國貨運動。而不能照着實際需要去做。那有什麽成效可見呢。</p>
<h3>英法成立諒解歐洲和平關鍵　東歐互助公約計劃　英允取善意的中立</h3>
<p>（倫敦）法國外長巴爾都現已離英、據美聯社所得可靠消息、英法此次談話、或可視爲大戰以後對於歐洲和平最有關係之舉動、據稱、兩日以來、外部海部兩處討論、共有二項重要結果、第一、英國對於法俄兩國之互助計劃、聯絡東歐七國包括德國在内一事、决取善意之中立態度、第二、法國表示、如德國加入此項東歐協約、法國對於軍備方面可大爲讓步、使德國可以相當程度重整軍備、法國此種讓步、尤爲此間政治外交各方所歡迎、均以爲可使垂危之軍縮會議、另得新生命云、德國海長皮特利現尚在此間、勾留數日、繼續與英國海軍大臣孟賽爾從長討論明年之海軍會議計劃、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）與外部有關係之要人今日表示意見、指法外長巴爾都赴倫敦之使命、已得極好結果、聞巴爾都與英外相西門之談話、已獲取英國對於一種東方洛迦諾公約之默認、並增厚英法關係之信任、且使英法對於俄國加入國聯之贊助、愈爲有力、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>軍縮問題讓步法對英交換條件</h3>
<p>（巴黎）報紙對於巴爾都外長倫敦談話之結果、極表滿意、倫敦談話之要點、似爲英國贊成法國所建議之東方羅迦諾公約、其交換條件爲法國於軍縮問題順從英國並放棄其過去所抱之不妥恊態度、</p>
<h3>英决置身局外但願促成互助約</h3>
<p>據巴黎報紙載稱、英將使互助公約措詞、得爲意德兩國所接受、自身則處局外、蘇俄當亦參加此約、但某報稱、英國方面深信德將拒絕加入、而蘇俄政府則以爲德國如能於國聯公約之範圍内加入互助公約、則亦預備參加云、換言之、卽蘇俄將請求加入國聯、而爲初步也、英國並不阻止蘇俄之加入、惟以蘇俄接受因加入國聯而起之全部責任爲條件、法報復稱、英國所以應善意考慮法國之建議者、因法國擔保不欲使蘇俄加入羅迦諾公約、而英國於羅迦諾條約外亦不再擔負其他義務、以及新互助公約確以互助爲基礎也、據各報載稱、英法聯盟實無其事、而包括一切現行區問公約之普遍公約已遭擱置云、所謂普通羅迦諾公約、與東方羅迦諾公約實無關係、據另一消息稱、鮑爾温向巴爾都明白表示、英國無論如何不欲與蘇俄加入任何恊定云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>公約成敗前途視意德態度而定</h3>

<p>華沙及柏林自在其内、至於蘇俄加入國聯會、英國之不反對、已成一定不易之事、自經巴爾都說明區域互助公約之性質及目的以後、英國政界對於此種計劃、誠懇贊成、　對於實行上、仍認爲有相當困難耳、英當局以爲公約所予各簽字國之保障、應有絕對相互性、巴爾都對於此點、當然業已予以必要之解釋、以安英國之心、所不可知者、惟歐洲行將如此訂立之公約、柏林與羅馬將如何接受耳、德國最近政變、在如何範圍内能變更德國外交政策、吾人目下亦不得而知、惟一般人觀察、以爲「舊德國」份子在德國旣占勝利、則各國與柏林交涉、在最近將來、或能感到便利、此層一部份有理、須知德國右派勝利、在近數月以内、固可望德國對外關係漸趨和緩、但爲時若久、則未必如是、因舊德國份子之外交政策、其靈敏與堅决、皆在第三德意志當局之上也、惟區域互助條約精確結果如何、吾人目下可暫置不論、總之此種計劃、在大體上已完全得到英國之同意、吾人惟靜待法國與其他各國談判之結果而已、談判進行時、如有待於英國之援助、而援助有成功之希望時、則英國亦必樂於臂助、已如上文所述矣、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英國無新諾言惰性消極的優惠英法公報終難窺端倪</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英法談話之公報、措詞仍甚奥妙、不易窺其端倪、而在英國官塲從事探詢、亦未能獲知其詳、法外長巴爾都雖以在英經過爲愉快、但英國對於法國願望之態度、可以巴黎日報所發「惰性的與消極的優惠」之短語總括之、英國並未發任何新諾言、但明白申說其嚴格履行現有諾言之意、法國欲努力維持歐洲之和平、尤注重東方洛迦諾、換言之、卽李維諾夫法俄互助公約之主張、法國欲英國對於法國此種努力、公佈其諒解之意、此約德國亦可加入、但德國不欲遽接受之、據法人之意、如其國對此公約表示好感、而德國猶不加入、則德國之孤立地位愈將顯著、而英國之態度、則以爲法國儘可進行、祇須東言洛迦諾公約不與西方洛迦諾公約相抵觸、而擴大西方洛迦諾簽字國之責任、則英國絕不過問他人事也、（十日路透社電）</p>

<p>社價高漲前因後果昨據豆米業公會常委朱子香語大公社記者</p>
<p>云、値此霉令、鄕農從事插秧播種之時、端賴雨水調潤、不料近月來氣候亢旱、致内地鄕鎭之河浜小港、潮水枯涸、蓋天旱景象農民忙於戽水、雖有儲米、欲行求售、但河水乾涸、不能運至城市、故上海來源、日見减少、惟上海本非產米之區、所有積存之貨、又因時令酷熱、恐被蒸變影響、早已脫售吿罄、而粳米存底、本來薄弱、上海市民稠密、日需浩繁、覩此旱災將成、相率備米防荒、在平時需要食米一石者、今則添購一石、以全市平日消費一萬二三千石計之、則增多三分之一、（約增四千餘石）如此來源旣稀、供不應求、米價安得不漲、以上海存米而論、粳米雖吿缺乏、然各行儲積之秈米、尚有三十餘萬石、足敷匝月、况最早出產之東新粳米、在半月内可以見樣、故米糧供求一層、决無斷米之虞云、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>社會科學的實際效用（續）　—答言普君—</h3>
<p>我們爲的是要理解社會，而不是爲着個人的升官發財。然而爲什麽要理解社會呢？如果完全不能解决我們的生活問題，我們去理解它做什麽？難道學社會科學就要忍受着餓死麽？這問題也來得不錯。自然，在想單靠研究社會科學來把我們的生活維持下去，不獨是萬萬不可能的，即令是可能，也就把社會科學變爲洋八股了。全社會的人個個都要想靠社會科學來吃飯，别的事一樣也不做，那社會還能成立嗎？個人的生活問題，因着個人所處的環境，他的技能，興趣等種種條件的不同而有各式各樣的解决方式。不能認爲研究某一項科學，就要直接的來「吃」這一類知識的飯。這完全是科舉時代遺傳下的有害的觀念。我們要知道，社會是一個整個的機構，今日的社會，以至於全世界，各部分各地方間都有着一種密切而不可分的互相聯繫，一部分一地方所發生的事情，必然地總要牽連到其他的任何部分。西半球的美國政府買收白銀，能使東半球的中國市塲感受極大的影響，世界的某一部分都脫離不開全體的牽動，而個人的生活問題也免不了全社會的波蕩，在全社會或全世界經濟恐慌的現在，個人即使有技能，有興趣，有環境，而仍然無法解决生活問題的還是多得很，要想離開了全社會關係而單獨就個人來解决個人的生活問題，在今日簡直不可能，簡直是夢想。自然，我們在現在也看見了少數幸運的人兒，然而這種人第一是要有特殊的背景，不是一般大衆所能做到。第二是他們生活是站在大衆的頭上，以大衆的血汗作他們享樂犧牲，而且這樣的人也只少數，他們雖然解决了個人的生活問題，而全社會的大衆的生活却受到了他們的摧殘，使社會秩序更爲紊亂。要解决大衆的每一個人的生活問題，根本地說起來，還是要從全社會解决起，若不從社會上着眼，只以個人的目前利益爲標凖，那麽不要說學社會科學不能替我們解决，其他任何的方法也不會對於我們大衆有什</p>
<p>麽好處。個人即使僥倖得到暫時的幸福，若與大衆毫無關係，那决不是根本的解决，例如買航空奬券即中了頭奬，對於個人生活自然不成問題，可以解决了，然而幾十萬人中才有幾個人可以中奬，這就不是解决大衆生活的方法，如果我們覺悟到自己只是幾十萬大衆中的一分子，那麽我們就要認淸楚這種想由僥倖而得解决生活問題的企圖是最危險不過的。對於我們的生活，决不可付諸命運，决不可屈伏於命運之前，應該看淸楚周圍，看淸楚前途，然後以積極的態度去對付一切，這樣即使也不免有失敗的時候，但總比閉着眼睛讓命運作弄的方法要有希望得多。</p>
<p>要看淸楚自己的周圍和前途，唯一的方法就是學社會科學。因此，社會科學實在能够爲我們提示根本的解决生活問題的方法。社會科學的實際效用就在這裏，這效用不是在於眼前的，僥倖的，而不可把握的幸福，而能顧慮到永久的，大多數人的生活，我們從社會科學裏找到了應走的道路，並且依照這道路前進，即使個人有時不免於失敗，對於大家總還有些助益，保况這樣做去總比閉着眼睛撞要有把握得多呢。而那只知斤斤於一己的幸福，不看一看社會的動向的人，其行爲就等於瞎撞。</p>
<p>科學是我們解决生活問題的最根本的唯一的指南針。我們應該牢牢地記住它，深深地確信它。但同時我們要放棄科舉時代殘餘的那種淺薄的實利主義的觀念。</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊夏令國貨飲食品專號</p>
<h3>貢獻話兩個愛用國貨的硬漢</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>夏令暑氣逼人，人身所需要的，莫如飲料。不論在舟車上，在菜館中，在公園裏，乃至居家休息，在職辦公，都是需要着飲料。汽水，橘子汁，果了露等等，差不多大家都要嘗嘗的。臨到宴會時候，還需要什麽啤酒等等，爲聯歡之品。</p>
<p>可是大家不飲汽水橘子水啤酒便罷，如果飲的，千萬不要馬虎的聽着茶房侍役打發。把許多外國貨，給你狂飲。最近我遇到兩個硬漢，無愧爲眞心提倡國貨的領袖，一位是蔡無忌先生，一位是方液仙先生，我却好是和他們同席。一次侍役把外國啤酒，外國汽水拚命的向各人玻璃杯中亂傾，方先生說且慢，我來看看牌子，一看以後，啤國不是烟臺啤酒，汽水不是屈臣氏，益利，老德記的出品。橘子汁果子露也不是冠生園家庭工業社亞美等廠的出品。方先生向侍役說，不行不行，非換不可，侍役面有難色，方先生說不飲好了，不多一時，侍役便把國貨飲料拿來了。一次，蔡先生請客，侍役們又把外國飲料，一瓶一瓶的拿來，蔡先生仔細一看，實行其檢騐技能，認定不是國貨，便把汽水一律退去，非買國貨不行。侍役都說先生們買來是等不及的，蔡先生說，那是不管，隔了一回，國貨汽水國貨啤酒都送來了。大家很佩服蔡先生意志堅强，這似乎是末節，是小事，可是涓涓不塞，影響國貨的生死很大，我願飲汽水啤酒的，仔細想想，不要以爲小小問題，値不得大驚小怪纔是辦法。我們趁這夏令天氣，特出一個夏令國貨飲食品專號，一面引起讀者購用國貨的興味，一面要揭破一般茶房侍役的壞脾氣。</p>
<h3>從暑天說到國貨飲食品</h3>
<p>— 童素貞</p>
<p>在今年天氣十分炎熱的時候，我們沒有要人的資格，不能到什麽牯嶺和莫干山去，所以祇好想到解暑的飲食品了</p>
<p>。不過我們在買解暑的飲食品，一方面要買貨眞價實的物品，一方面也要注意購買國貨的東西，一方合了買解暑的飲食品不忘愛國的本旨了。</p>
<p>菓子露，是一件最廉而美的飲品，旣是衛生，又可解暑，在夕陽西下，暮色蒼茫的時候，納凉在豆棚瓜架之下，抬頭望月，披襟當風，一杯在手，其樂無窮，尤其在今年天氣十分炎熱，時疫流行，疾病叢生之中，比較了西瓜，來得有益，因爲今年的西瓜，也許天氣久旱的關係，難免不發生有害於人體，所以的菓子露，可以應時盛行於市上了。　　乾菜，也是炎暑的素品，味道很佳，價亦不貴，無論泡湯煮熟，以及做家中的素點等，也是很適宜的食品，十分有味，來得好吃，這是國貨中的夏令要品，比較魚肉滿桌，珍饈盈席，來得衛生而可餐了。因爲在揮汗如雨之下，最好吃的乾菜，免得腹中滯膩，引起河魚等患，並非提倡素食，本來暑天吃素，較爲有益，所以爲防患未然起見，戒除病從口出，當然以乾菜，爲絕妙佳品了。</p>
<p>這兩件物品，可以說每家必需之品，旣有解暑的飲品，又有助饌的妙物，一個夏天，有了這兩件東西，可以安然度夏了。主持家事，照料兒童的女性們，不要忘記了冠生園的菓子露和唯一廠的乾菜呀！</p>
<p>我們在暑天的時候，樂用國貨飲食品，也是表示一點愛用國貨的微忱，同時呼一聲「暑天不忘愛國」的新口號呀！</p>
<h3>夏令飲食與國貨</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>時候是盛夏了，在逼人炎威侵襲下的人們，自然沒有一個不在嚷熱，同時，對於各項夏令飲食品的需要，自也沒有一個不感覺得迫切，你看那馬路上冷飲攤的林立，公司裏飲冰室的添增，當然是無一不在象徵着夏令飲食品的重要。</p>
<p>可是，在這裏，我們又要從歷史過程上的經騐，去看看歷年來舶來飲食品的驚人輸入，在我國入超數字上，是佔着如何重要的位置，尤其是夏季，什麽汽水啊！啤酒啊！一切的冷飲物吕呵！猛烈的傾銷，早已形成他們市塲獨佔的局面，說來眞堪痛心，而我們在這種嚴重的訓示下，歷史的回味，勗促我們於這「婦女國貨年」中關於夏令飲食品選購，該如何儘量地去採取國貨，並廣爲宣揚，以資提倡，冀得挽回漏巵之一部，自不待言，因此，在下面，我也敢把我所知道的，來約略替他介紹一下··</p>
<p>關於飲的方面··冷飲物品，爲夏季中一日不可缺的東西，解渴生凉，在在需他，國貨中如益利汽水，冠生園果子露，無敵牌鮮橘汁，烟台五星啤酒等，無不價廉物美，淸潔新鮮，儘可極力採取，何必定須仰給舶來，而把整千整萬的大好金錢，去送給洋大人享用呢？　　關於食的方面··夏令食品，本宜首重淸潔，最好常抱「素食主義」，極力免除葷腥，以防細菌傳染的危險，而採取素食後，像三星之觀音粉，天廚之味精，均係調味良品，爲尊廚中不可缺乏之物，而其他如各國貨廠商之罐頭食物，也均須以科學方法製成，十分新鮮淸潔，正也可爲人加餐之助。</p>
<p>最後，我還有一點深切的希望，就是你們在這夏令中的宴客叙餐，不要再像國貨公司，商塲内，都有很好的飲食部，地位淸凉，價又便宜，足供嘉賓戾止，而你自己以國貨餉客，寓提倡國貨於飲食中，又是如何有意義又光榮的事呢！</p>
<h3>合理化的消夏飲品</h3>
<p>— 趙富魁</p>
<p>飛也似的光陰，過得眞快，一瞬眼，炎炎的夏天，又到來了，尤其是今年的夏季，和往年格外不同，寒暑表的熱度，竟升至百度以外，不得不使我們感到夏季的難受，在這種情况之下，自然消夏的飲料，無疑地，是我們度過這個</p>
<p>炎炎的夏天的恩物了。</p>
<p>怎樣解决夏季的消夏問題？怎樣購置夏季的消夏飲品？這是一個問題，尤其在這國貨年中，更成爲一個値得討論的問題，所以申報國貨週刋之能特出專號，討論這個問題，不特是適合需要，而且是適合時令，未始不是一件有相當價値的事。</p>
<p>我認爲夏季的消夏飲品，應以合理化的原則，什麽是合理化的消夏飲品呢？一言以蔽之，便是國貨的飲品而已，我往往看見許多朋友，他們吃橘子汁，好好的家庭工業的橘子汁不吃，徧要吃外國貨的橘子汁，他們吃汽水，好好的益利的汽水不吃，徧徧要吃外國貨的汽水，他們吃冰淇淋，好好的國人開設的飲冰室裏不去吃，徧徧要到外國人開設的飲冰室裏去吃，諸如此類的例子，眞是舉不勝舉，我看到了這種情形，眼看到國人的金錢，被這般崇拜洋貨，輕視國貨的準亡國奴，一批一批的送到外國人的口袋中去，覺得異常痛心，表示十二分的惋惜，十二分的遺憾！</p>
<p>所以，我在現在，倒要勸勸這般崇拜外國貨的國人們，請從今以後，快些學悟起來吧，須知我們多吃一瓶外國汽水，就等於多養活一個外國人，同時也就是多殺掉一個同種同文同血統的同胞，你在夏季之中，多吃了外國東西，就多養活了許多外國人，翻過來講，也就是你多殺了中國同胞，朋友，你肯做自家殺自家人的劊子嗎？如其不肯，那末，當你在購買消夏飲料的時候，請你絕對的要購買國貨國產的消夏飲料。</p>
<h3>國產飲食品的勝利外國啤酒國貨啤酒</h3>
<h3>提倡國貨應特别注重夏令用品</h3>
<p>— 唐敦瑩女士</p>
<p>夏令到了，人們的用品也就增加了許多。因爲天氣的炎熱，沒有電風扇，不足以却暑；不用冷飲品，很不容易解渴；爲了蚊蟲的滋擾，不得不用蚊香；要保護皮膚，辟除穢氣，當然須用化妝品；其他若草帽，陽傘，絲襪，汗衫等，以及一切紗羅綢紡各種衣料，更爲仕女們夏令所必不可少的。但是這許多物品，從前是舶來品居多，所以每年夏季，爲推銷洋貨者，把金錢流到外國去，實在不在少數，想起來是何等的傷心！近年來我國的工商業，却能急起直追，把各種夏令用品，層出不窮的製造出來，供給社會，這是値得提倡的！不但是品質優良，而且價格低廉，現在所需的用品，大致是應有盡有了。愛用國貨的有胞們！當此夏令，亟應堅定意志服用國貨，切不可再醉心虚榮，購用洋貨。免得利權外溢，而替國外保存點原氣！這是應請特别注意的！</p>
<h3>如何解决夏令的飲料問題巴玲</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>事實吿訴我們··「今年的夏季，是特别的炎熱，寒暑表裏的水銀，昇至一百度以上，是一件常有的事，誠爲近數十年來所希有之炎熱！」據熟悉天文的朋友說··「熱度有繼續增長之勢·」這樣看來，今年的夏季生活，倒是一個難於解决的問題。</p>
<p>住在上海的人們，除了一般自食其力，出賣血汗勞力的勞苦同胞外，其餘中產階級，以及一般資產階級的人們，在這夏季裏，是不會發生恐慌和問題的，他們有的是錢，金錢眞是萬能，有了金錢，一切問題，便可宣吿解决，出外有摩脫車代步，在室内則有電扇，口喝了，可以開幾瓶荷囒水，橘子汁來吃吃，這種生活，是多麽的使我們這般靠筆耕爲活的窮措大的羨慕呀！</p>
<p>不過，我對於這般豐衣足食的闊老們，摩登太太，摩登奶奶，摩登小姐，以及一般的摩登的靑年們，倒有幾句話要奉勸奉勸你们須知，今年是國貨年，當你們腦海中正在打算着購置消夏食品的時候，請認淸目標，認淸責任，認淸當前國家的危急狀態，而决凡購買國貨的消夏品，飲那國貨的消夏飲料，來挽回利權，杜塞漏扈，我相信全上海的摩登人物，如能共同覺悟起來，那末，國產的消夏飲料，一定能因此暢銷，金錢的外溢，一定能减少許多，而直接的，間</p>
<p>接的，有形的，無形的推銷國貨，救濟失業羣衆，保存國家元氣，其功績誠有不可統計者。</p>
<p>至於國產的消夏飲料，如家庭工業社亞美的橘子汁，益利屈臣氏汽水廠的汽水，生生牧場的牛乳，以及冰淇淋等，都是上等的貨色，較之舶來品，誠有過之無不及之處，我很希望全國人士，—尤其是住在上海的人們，對於這個夏令的飲料問題，切實的購買國貨，須知我們假如吃了舶來品的東西，無異自己吞下炸彈，和毒藥下去，一時雖不感覺到什麽，到後來總不免要受枉的，發作的，我想··一個自愛愛人的人，一定不肯做這種不合稱的事的！</p>
<h3>夏令飲食品叢談</h3>
<p>— 張孟晤</p>
<p>一日三餐之外的夏令飲食品，家家戶戶，總要備些，孩童環繞的人家，飲食品格外要淸潔，衛生，特别留意呢！　　冠生園的桔子，擰檬，香蕉，蘋菓，等···…菓子露，胡慶餘堂，徐重道國藥號的金銀花露，在這火繖高張的時候，，我家是常購備的，當夫斗室苦熱，胸中煩悶，冷開水中，和以少許菓子露，飲之甘凉淸香，胸襟一暢！</p>
<p>屈臣氏益利公司的汽水，橘水，冰凍之後，也是異常淸沁，可謂消夏的良友！</p>
<p>家製綠荳湯，拌以糯米，和以薄荷、冲開水待冷食之，用作午點，味亦可口！沉李浮瓜，雪藕調冰，更是夏天的樂事！和必飲外國汽水，外國啤酒以爲樂？</p>
<p>此外西湖藕粉，冰凍荳腐，蝦子拌</p>
<p>罐頭筍，無錫罐頭麵筋，冷醃綫粉，均是夏日佐餐的聖品！更何必外國西餐，沙利文冷食呢？怱怱寫此，溽暑頓消！一封信</p>
<h3>懺悔</h3>
<p>— 酉之</p>
<p>蘋哥；</p>
<p>請你依然允許我這樣稱你。我虔敬地請求你讀完我這封信。我是個犯了罪的囚人，請你寬恕了我吧！蘋哥！我想尋出一個將要毁滅的火星來，在你對我絕望了的情緒中，以拯救我自己，更拯救我們倆過去的關係。</p>
<p>好幾天沒有你的信，我是等得多麽不耐煩，像是一個熱鍋上的螞蟻。我叮囑了小弟候在門口等綠衣人的來臨，可是，三天，五天，七天……過去，直到今天——第十四天——晚上，一封掛號信從小弟手中發見了，只要看了筆跡，便可知道是你寄我的。我内心的歡喜，眞是百萬分了。終於走到房間裏戰戰競競地拆開信封。全神貫注的看了。唉！不看猶可，我哭了，我痛哭了；你是絕我了！呌我如何能讀下去呢？倒要牀上，枕頭也被苦涙濕透了。我痛悔我過去的行動，不該不聽你眞誠的勸吿！原來，你的絕我，完全爲了我不愛用愛貨的緣故。蘋哥！你的愛國心多麽熱烈，你的人格多麽偉大，更使人越加不能不愛你！</p>
<p>蘋哥！你說我的讀書是一種裝飾品，無異於戒指及高跟鞋；你又說我沒有國家觀念，民族意識，喪心病狂地用外國貨；你又說我生活奢侈，不能刻苦耐勞。是的，這些都是我的缺點，更是構成你絕我的原因。但是，讓我今天向你</p>
<p>宣誓！我要過我嚴格的新生活，不買半文外國貨，否則就任你駡我，打我，絕我。過去，我的思想和行動，誠然太錯誤，如今我得澈底地轉變了！我雖是一個女子，但也是社會上的一分子，並且還算是有智識的，在這帝國主義侵略與農村經濟破產的中國境况之下，應該覺悟到自身提倡國貨使命的重大與迫切！我要好好地做一個國家有用的人！也纔能配做你的愛人！請你大膽地信任我吧！</p>
<p>誠如你所說，我的過去生活被虚榮心操縱住了；只知道享受，却未曾想到自己對别人的貢獻如何？一味學所謂時髦，倒不去謀思想上的進步。是的，這是我心理上的錯誤。蘋哥！請你指導我！讓我做一個新生運動，把以前一切的傳統的觀念，舊的生活形態，掉一個尾。未來種種，譬如今天所生！</p>
<p>蘋哥！請你收回你的成命吧！我把我的心向你剖白了！懺悔了！你給我一個自新的機會吧！我想你無論如何會允許我的！好！讓我們一同來努力，從事國貨運動！至少，我們得在現社會中去敲一個警鐘，讓像我一樣酣睡着的人們醒來！萬萬請你接受我的一點點意思。祝你</p>

<h3>婦女界之推行國貨談</h3>
<p>— 劍花女士</p>
<p>時至今日。我人服用國貨。雖尚不及東西各國民衆之認眞。但一般智識界人。至少已能漸將愛好舶來品之心。變而爲愛好國貨。觀乎近來國產品之日益增加。國貨商塲之逐漸添設。足見已較前數年爲不同。此未始非良好現象。不過我對於國貨之推行。及爲謀服用國貨者之便利起見。覺有數點。敢以貢獻於提倡國貨需君之前。</p>
<p>（一）多設國貨聯合商店卽以本市而論。地位遼闊。華租各界。商店林立。百貨雜陳。但欲求一完全銷售國貨之商店。實如鳳毛麟角。於是我人雖有購買國貨之心。往往因時間關係。地點關係。不能遄赴國貨商塲購置。而卽向附近各店舖購買。該項店主。重利輕義。且</p>
<h3>幾個疑問？肖白</h3>
<p>一個人連自己生活素上最緊要的—飲食品，也須仰給於外人，我眞不懂這個人還是有熱血的，抑是凉血動物？</p>
<p>「進口，進口，」一般人所謂的進口，還不過是指舶來品進海關的口，現在我眼見有大批的夏令飲食品，要眞實的進同胞們的口，哀莫大於心死，」這兩者可怕的程度，又孰爲深刻化？</p>
<p>貪了一時口腹的享受，或有嚼冰喝水中，或在酒醉煙迷中，不惜把大好的金錢，整千整萬的去送到洋大人手中，遺下了國破家亡的禍根，麻木他們最惡毒的傾銷，你們想，値得不値得？</p>
<h3>夏令國貨飲料笑話兩則</h3>
<p>— 褚劍屏</p>
<p>（一）玉皇大帝大發雷霆</p>
<p>「我還來的時候，帶些玻璃橘子你吃好嗎」？我見玉皇大帝這幾天熱得可憐，所以在昨天出門的時候，這樣問他一句··</p>
<p>「你自己去吃吧！人家熱得這樣，你還尋得落開心哩！玻璃做的橘子，吃了豈不要劃穿肚皮，難道你眞的還想做一次新官人嗎」？她竟柳眉倒豎，血盆大張的和我鬥氣起來了。後來好容易經我指天誓日，費了一點三十五分的解釋時間，又在近處買了一瓶無敵牌的玻璃橘子，做了我辯護的證據，她才嫣然一笑，言歸於好。</p>
<p>（二）送貨員大呼觸霉頭</p>
<p>昨天我打電話給中國國貨公司，呌他們送兩打國貨啤酒。這位接電話的先生，大約是杭州人，講起話來「姐兒姐兒」，有些不大淸楚；我因爲各大公司的杭州人很多，倒也並不在意。</p>
<p>約莫兩小時之後，他們的送貨員，提了兩隻黃色的方匣子，滿頭大汗的走進來；我一看發票的品名，是皮球兩打。知道這位杭州先生，做了纏夾老二了。我在捧腹之下，便將此意吿知送貨員，送貨員不禁大呼其觸霉頭。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>善於迎合心理，和顧客需要國貨。彼等卽以改頭換面之劣貨冒充。顧客不察。每易爲所朦混。而該店主卽可以本輕利厚之洋貨脫售。例如同居某君等。盥洗均用力士香皂。詢以何不用國貨。則謂我等在附近小店購買。彼等俱說此亦國貨耳。國貨之無由發展。此爲一大原因。爲今之計。惟有請國貨界諸領袖。商得各百貨商店或布店襪店等同意。約爲國貨聯合商店。一律專售國貨用品。貨物統由總店（國貨商塲）供給。必須隨時通知。隨時送到。此種商店。每隔若干門面設立一所。貨物等可相流通。以省地位。定價必須一律。卽顧客捨此就彼。亦可不出範圍。如此則愛用國貨者有國貨可購。不用國貨者。自無洋貨可用矣。</p>
<p>（二）分贈摺劵優待顧客各聯合商店。須備有優待顧客摺子及贈劵若干份。開幕前先行挨戶分送摺子一扣。每次購物滿洋一元者。錢須付現。但得登記摺上。每月或半年結算一次。期内購貨積滿洋十元或二十元者。贈五角劵或一元券一張。多則類推。並可兌現。如此則每一顧客可永爲該店老主顧。學校及機關。尤應多多贈送。以廣招徠。</p>
<p>（三）價廉物美招待殷勤國貨尚在萌芽時代。提倡者須抱有犧牲精神。祇要不虧血本。定價切勿過昂。尤忌以次貨混售。店夥須擇温和誠懇之人充當。使對顧客殷勤招待。而不疾言厲色。此爲各商店通病。不可不注意及之。</p>
<p>（四）定貨送貨不誤時刻如遇定製物品。或因店中缺貨。約時送到者。須恪守時刻。不稍延誤。使顧客十分滿意。則此後源源惠顧。可操左劵。</p>
<p>以上數點。似頗簡易可行。是否有當。尚待研究。俾得籌有確當辦法。使國貨前途。大放異彩。實爲我人所馨香禱祝者也。</p>
<h3>兩件不摩登的夏令食品</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>（一）六月素</p>
<p>普通社會上的人，一到炎夏的天氣，總要戒除葷腥，專食素菜。在外表上多少總帶些迷信色彩；而在原則上倒也合乎衛生。所以吃六月素這件事，不但不可以厚非；我們還應該提倡。因爲炎暑天氣，蚊蠅蝟集，葷腥最易傳佈病菌；此外脂肪質太厚，對於體氣也不相宜；倒不如素食别有風味，而且也不會出毛病。至於普通所吃的素菜，靑菜·荳腐·瓜茄，鄕人親自種栽，倒是十足道地的國貨。精緻一些，像香菌·麻菇·扁尖·紫菜一類，也無仇貨羼入。所以這不摩登的六月素，旣合衛生，又是提倡國貨，我們眞應該倡行咧！</p>
<p>（二）剖西瓜</p>
<p>汽水·冰淇淋，凉爽果然是凉爽，試問這些東西裏邊的原料，以及製造的器械，是否純粹國貨？而且價格昂貴，也决非一般普通人可以吃個暢快。這樣看來，剖瓜解暑，倒也提倡國貨，節省經濟。古人「浮瓜沉李」，本當他是暑天的樂事。這事雖不合摩登條件，然而把瓜在凉水中浸透，奏刀𥒐然，瓤汁四濺，持而大嚼，未始不是一件快事。也有人說食瓜不合衛生，這又是井蛙之見了！你想瓜瓤包在厚厚的瓜皮内，怎會有病菌混入。只要切開之後，一氣吃光；卽使吃不完的話，把紗罩蓋好，不使蚊蠅叮咬，决不會出毛病的。吃西瓜也是提倡國貨，諸位不要以爲問題小而忽略；也不要以爲開倒車而嗤笑。</p>
<h3>談凉菜</h3>
<p>— 徐季搏</p>
<p>凉菜，一名洋菜，又名凍粉，古人稱爲凍瓊脂，日本人呌他寒天，他的製法很簡單的，把石花菜等海藻取上後，乾燥之，再浸入淡水中濕潤後，利用日光晒白，將其舂搗，和水煮熟，注入少許酸液，（普通用醋酸，硫酸，硼酸，醋）煮到相當的程度，將液濾過，分注於一定容量之器具内，使液凝固，再切成細條，更充公冷却卽成，他在素食品中是估重要的位置，尤其是在這炎熱的夏季，若將其煮溶，凝凍爲凉粉，加點薄荷液及糖等實爲很好的冷食品之一以其淸潔衛生價値也不大，是以有不少的人家用以却暑解渴，街道上亦有許多小販製成此種凉粉零賣，菜館中所謂香蕉凍，玫瑰凍，亦均以凉菜煮化冰凍而成，就是凉粉拌鷄絲亦是現在應時的菜餚，所以在這個夏令，凉菜的銷塲，是特别的大，可是牠的來路是何處呢，在兩年前確確實實從日本來的，不過石花菜等海藻，我國沿海的出產，並不在少數，從前粤閩皆有設廠製造者，以供不敷求，日貨乘機而入，後竟喧賓奪主，國產洋菜竟被壓迫而絕跡，每年進口者達七八百萬元，漏巵殊巨，及九一八，一二八之後，國人抵制劣貨甚爲熱烈，日產洋菜，曾一度滯銷，寗波如生廠乃乘時而起，就地取材，製成凉菜，銷諸市上，頗受國人歡迎，曾暢銷一時，不圖本年來又有大批劣貨凉菜，陸續進口，跌價傾銷，致使國貨又無人過問，該廠亦不得不减價出售，日前市商會曾致函南貨業及南北貨拆兌業兩同業公會，勸銷國產，函内有謂「從前並無國貨凉菜出品之時，代售外貨，猶可謂事非得已，茲則國人旣有設廠仿製，儘有代替品足以應世，……希督促同業，對凉菜代銷國產，拒售外貨，……」云云，惟日貨傾銷，無微不致，尚請購食者留心一點，據我的經騐，國貨製品，外觀上色稍灰黑，粗細不匀，不若日貨之色白及粗細一致，口味上則不稍遜於日貨，切不可看見了凉菜先冷了心血，管他是不是國貨呢，</p>
<h3>幾件値得注意的夏令用品</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>記者最近和幾位在學校中敎書的朋友談天，東談談西講講，不料又講到國貨問題上來了。甲指着乙的草帽說··「朋友，你要當心，現在劣貨的草帽，正在大批的傾銷。我們不要貪便宜，而上他們的大當啊！據說··現在市上價廉物美的草帽，都是劣貨仇貨，眞是危險極了！」乙指甲的汗衫說··「唉！不要說這草帽是仇貨劣貨吧！我們身上穿的汗衫，也要謹防仇貨的冒充啊！我有一位朋友，在某商店裏買了二件汗衫之後，認爲十分滿意，因爲每件只有五六角錢，不料買回來以後，不上幾天，便穿了二三個洞，才知道又是上了某國人的大當了……」當時在談話的時間，朋友甲忽然拿出「人丹」來了，於是我便和他說··「朋友，你也要留心這人丹呀！「人丹虹」，國貨的雖有好幾家出品，可是某國人心狡意滑，時常把劣貨來冐充，所以，我們也要注竟呀！……」談話談到這裏，大家便互相歎息了一回，憤慨了一回，認爲從今而後，不但要立志購買國貨，而且尤其要留心冒牌的國貨，萬萬買不得，因爲買了冐牌的國貨，不特袋袋中的金錢，被某國人拿去，而且還要給他們在背後譏笑呢？這眞是一件十分不合算之事。</p>
<p>我和這幾位朋友分别了以後，回到寓所，細細地把這件事想了一想，覺得葦帽，人丹，汗衫，確是我人在夏令中所不可缺少的東西，可是我們倒要防備防備，不要讓仇貨的草帽，戴在我們的頭上，仇貨的汗衫，穿在我們的身上，仇貨的人丹，吃在我們的肚裏，否則，我們假如糊裏糊塗，馬馬虎虎的過去，難保這種仇貨，不跑到我們的身上，頭上，和嘴裏來呢？</p>
<p>怎樣使這種仇貨的草帽，汗衫，和人丹，不跑到我們的身上，頭上，和我們的嘴裏呢？我倒要在這裏介紹幾處可靠的地方給諸位可愛可親的讀者··</p>
<p>（一），草帽——請到靠得住的國貨工廠形影相隨</p>
<p>奪華　榮婦女國貨　　玲</p>
<p>，如華福製帽公司等地方去買，終不會上當，千萬不要買滑頭的沒有照牌的草帽。</p>
<p>（二）人丹——請到中法藥房等中貨藥房裏去買，千萬不要買沿途呌喊的滑頭人丹。</p>
<p>（三）汗衫——請到著名的國貨内衣工廠，如景綸和五和等内衣廠裏去買，可算最最靠得住的了。</p>
<h3>國貨上的洋字是否必要？</h3>
<p>— 梁小鴻</p>
<p>朋友有設廠製造國貨者，要我畫個商標或裝璜的圖案，總呌我寫上幾個英文字，可是我偏偏生就了一副怪脾氣，不願在國貨上加上一個洋字；這樣，朋友顯然不快了，也許背後還笑我固執。　　民國初年，中國人着了洋貨的迷，充斥在市上的幾乎全是洋貨，少數國貨，也祇得加上一個洋式的裝璜，冒充着洋貨推銷。可是現在就不同了··國人對於民族的意識已很深切地瞭解，對於國貨也有了相當的信仰，而且國貨底創製和改良，都有着驚人的進步，提倡國貨的呼聲，在每個有識者的口中喊出。不單這樣，連洋文的使用也極力减少，不信吧？國產影片底字幕上華商電車底路牌上都已取消了洋文的說明。這是個很好的例子。</p>
<p>不過，一部份商人頭腦裏仍舊留着這種歪曲的觀念，以爲國人還是喜觀洋貨的多，還是有着一種見了洋字裝璜的貨品就說好的幼稚心理。於是爲了要賤錢起見，把好好的國貨給套上一個有洋字的裝璜，甚且連一個中國字都沒在，不光如此，有人竟然連名稱也採家洋化，這尤其在捲烟中可以見到。這麽一來，使我們愛用國貨的民衆反而滿腹狐疑，認不淸這到底是國貨還是洋貨。</p>
<p>有人說··這是因爲要推銷到外洋去的緣故。那简直是夢話！中國貨品有多少能够銷到外洋？就是有，難道說不加上洋字就不能推銷嗎？是否都有華文？　　這明是阻礙民族的發展，養民中國人愛用洋貨的劣性，我們要提倡國貨，這種歪曲的觀念該先根本打倒！</p>
<h3>夏令衛生之重要</h3>
<p>— 琅琊王</p>
<p>凡身體虧弱之人。當茲夏令炎暑酷熱。格外感覺痛苦。欲免除此種痛苦。仍宜從個人身體上謀根本上之辦法。始克有濟。並有事實上證明。能爲讀者吿焉。前年余内弟馨芳。服務一英商洋行。卽以操勞過度。身體虧弱。每到夏季。在行事務並不紛忙。亦感過度疲勞。隨時發生小病。在此夏令。又未相當之調養。交秋後一病幾殆。後延本埠名醫陳存仁先生診視。始獲痊可。以馨芳爲陰虚火旺之體質。最忌一切燥膩性之補品。宜隨時服食淸補滋潤之四川銀耳。以資調養。並囑在夏令更宜加量服食。因夏季酷熱逼人。並蟲蚊肆虐。每不能早時安眠。更易傷損陰分。銀耳最富滋潤陰分之質素。旣可調補原有之缺陷。又可救濟當前之困難。體氣並可逐漸使其强壯。更免秋後之疾病。馨芳卽爲顯然之例證。去夏雖在伏暑治事亦勝任愉快。無疲勞之象。選購銀耳。須選可靠之貨。不求外表美觀。不加硫磺薰染。故滋補之效力最大。兹以關於夏令之衛生甚爲生要。特草此文以供各界人士之研究。</p>

<p>國貨好，國貨牢。中華國貨刮刮呌。式樣新，價格巧。不比洋貨重外貎，價錢貴得勿得了。國家窮，爲入超。入超都因用洋貨，中華國產來忘掉。奉勸中國好同胞，提倡國貨要記牢。和種洋貨如拒用，洋貨自然絕跡了！</p>

<h3>產前</h3>
<p>— 何其憨</p>
<p>娟的腹部是一天窿高一天，算算孕期已經有九個足月，破產，當然就是眼前的事情了。娟娟今年雖已十九歲了，還像一個小孩子，很怕難爲情；他覺得腹</p>
<p>部凸得這麽高，見人是怕羞的事。如果不是我與他有夫妻的關係，我這樣陪伴她，凖害得她整日整夜的臉紅。</p>
<p>孕，雖然是我倆結合後第一次發現的奇跡，然而娟對於產後的一切，她都早已日日夜夜躱在房裏盤算好了。看她那種支配和籌幄的情形，好像比誰都有經騐。</p>
<p>有人說，這就是女性天賦的聰明之處。</p>
<p>不論產後是男是女，第一要解决的便是嬰孩的服裝。娟的意思是想摹倣隔壁人家的嬰孩採辦幾件輕薄而美麗的襯衣，羊毛外套褲等，一切都要我到西洋店舖裏去揀，據說中國貨不好看！</p>
<p>我固然贊在嬰孩的服裝要摹倣西洋人穿的輕薄舒適，不要老是循着中國人的舊例把嬰孩穿的擁腫不堪，使嬰孩的驅體和四肢完全失却自由於發育方面有碍。然而，要採用西洋貨，那就大可不必，但是，我不敢當面違抗娟的主張，我愛娟的，我不希望好在這孕期裏得到無所謂的煩惱！</p>
<p>今天，大槪娟是知道了產是不遠了，所以催促我，要我今天一天把嬰兒的衣服採辦完全。這眞使我爲難了，因爲聽她的命令與不聽她的命令都發生了問題。當我正在暗暗焦灼的時候，出於意料的，娟的媽提了小箱子從門外笑嘻嘻的走了進來。她見了我和娟，便愉快地說··「文！娟！我知道你們倆快要抱小孩子了，所以，我特地辦了幾件國貨的小服裝來送給你們」！</p>
<p>我聽了丈母的話，不禁心裏一寬。</p>
<p>娟的媽把手提箱打開，拿出許多小衣裳和小玩具來，衣服的式樣和衣料，都是合乎娟的理想的。不過娟還有些不懂含笑地問··「媽！這都是國貨嗎，這樣優良？」</p>
<p>「是呀！」娟的媽回答着「國貨是比從前進步得多了。因爲今年是兒童年，又是國貨年，所以我就主張買國貨的東西。我希望產下來的外甥穿了這衣服將來就是愛國的偉人！」</p>
<p>娟的媽笑了，娟也笑了，我呢？當然也是笑！</p>
<h3>一週間國貨新訊</h3>
<p>（一）財政部自公佈進口新稅則以後，内容頗不合於保護關稅之原則，國貨產品將大受打擊，引起國内工商界極大之反響。在此一週間，本市紗布業，絲業，煤業，紙業，紛電政府，請收回成命；又市商會，工業總聯會，總工會，機聯會，及棉業界亦均有沉痛表示，惟政府尚無正式宣言。</p>
<p>（二）江西省擬辦大規模機器製瓷工廠，自經瓷業專家杜重遠親往勘查後，進行愈臻具體化。該廠由贛省府出資二十萬元，改爲商辦性質，省府並保障事業之順利進展，不受任何阻力，聞杜君卽將前往籌辦。</p>
<p>（三）實業部近委何炳賢設計擴展南洋國貨市塲，按照部定四項原則進行，）見前期本欄）聞何氏卽將召集本市國貨廠商，籌商進行辦法。</p>
<p>（四）湖南省建設廳擬辦之酒精廠，已勘定長沙南門外爲廠址，資金定爲三十萬元，明春卽可正式開廠。</p>
<p>（五）國貨廠商馮雲初曹志功等，集資籌設無錫國貨商塲，現已勘定地址，從事建築，未開幕前，先於八月十五日開展覽會三星期，附設臨時商塲，以作營業上之試騐。</p>
<p>（六）徐州賈汪煤礦，爲江蘇省唯一之煤礦，煤質異常優美，自經本市華東公司加闢新井完成後，出品卽將行銷於市，必可爲國煤放一異彩。</p>
<p>（七）中華國貨產銷合作恊會所組織之西北流動展覽團，已在開封，鄭州，洛陽，三處輪流展覽，成績甚佳。該團不日將赴西安展覽，本市第四批徵品一百六十餘箱，業於日内運送到會。</p>

<h3>中華戰情</h3>
<p>陣線更動中華會對北草地、滿擬以十五比零大勝、結果爲十七比一、亦堪自慰、但鄭兆佳因因游泳小腿撞傷、刻在醫院療養、梁德光手傷、孫麟方腸瀉、均未出塲、故陣綫大爲調動、由中國網球會公開雙打冠軍余田光王文正任第一組、林寳華與程貽澤任第三組、邱飛海原對梁德光任第一組、因梁遲遲未到、臨時拉老將陶亭耀客串、結果五組全勝、且除第五組大间失去一盤外、餘均三盤全勝、</p>

<h3>網球新術（二）Ｊ·ＰＡＲＭＬＹ　ＰＡＲＥＴ原著錢一勤洪均合譯—版權所有不准轉載—</h3>
<p>握拍法、雖然好像學習ＡＢＣ一樣的簡易、但是極端地重要、在握拍法的各點未曾熟諳以前、簡直不要隨意握拍去拍球、因爲若是初次握拍時、採用了不良的方法、此種錯誤將影響及以後每一次的拍擊、並且很容易成爲固定的習慣、拍球的次數愈多、則愈難改正、</p>
<p>第一、握拍時要握在柄端、不是柄的中部、或離柄端略上的部份、起初、這似乎有點困難、因爲初學者握在拍柄最長處擊球、當然沒有握在較短處來得容易、但這是優良球藝最關緊要的部分、而且不久必定就會感覺容易的、</p>
<p>通常初學者、以爲他應當緊緊地握住球拍在手中、並且見球就重重地撞去、他總是以爲重用堅硬的腕臂握拍、並且他對球撞擊、是要用足力量去使球的飛力迅速、其實此種力量的需要、是極少、因爲正當的拍擊、是一種輕便靈活而有節拍的擺動、那是依賴球拍的動力大、球員的手臂力小、</p>
<p>握着拍柄的末端、在未拍擊以前、將球拍慢慢向後方擺動、然後像鐘擺一樣的、用力迅速向前擺動去迎擊來球、若是握着拍柄的末端、拍擊的力量自然大大地增加、手臂手腕和球拍像一條鞭子一樣的動作、於是拍和球撞擊的時候、力量就會强大、</p>
<p>最近美國出版網球叢書的末册、名呌「方法與球員“Ｍｅｔｈｏｄ　ａｎｄ　ｐｌａｙｅｒｓ”曾徵集全世界網球名手對於握拍方法的方見、他們的共同點、都是贊成握着球拍的末端、並且絕對地贊成握緊、這就是很顯明的證據、</p>
<p>有的球員贊成在拍擊時、手略爲放鬆、但是此種方法、實足以損壞球藝、較之其他任何錯處更利害、因爲能够實行此種擊法的必要是有超等技術的球員、而且還要有特殊的技能、使來球確實撞在球拍的中心、才能將手略爲放鬆、至於其他百分之九十九的球員、是斷難做到的、所以握着球拍的末端和握緊拍柄、才是初學者球藝成功的金律、</p>
<p>拍面和手的解度變遷的方式極多、鐵爾登曾敎人一種最好又最易明瞭的規律、對於學習迎擊右方來球所用的「正手拍擊」Ｆｏｒｅｈａｎｄ　ｓｔｏｒｋｅ時、此時的握拍方式、初學者最好將球拍邊橫豎在桌子邊上、把拍柄對着自己、然後和后柄握手、就像和朋友握手一樣、</p>
<p>拍面對於手的正當角度、另有一條規律、就是當手包着拍柄的時候、手指尖應當向着所要擊球地一樣方向的拍弦一面、姆指和食指中間的虎口、也應當剛巧在拍柄的上方、</p>
<p>拍擊動作時、握拍處要極自如、並且屈折灣曲要極方便、手腕是於前後曲折的樞鈕、而且是拍擊時常用的樞鈕、所以握拍必要常使手腕有極大的自由、有的握法是要鎖住手腕的、如是這種握法、就會牽制拍擊的自由、</p>

<h3>哈長綫上</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>哈長綫上的火車，有大票車小票車兩種，大票車分一二三等，小票車一槪是四等。大票車也可以說是快車，自然，輪到小票車身上該是慢車了。</p>
<p>大票車的設置，把座位分成三層，和南滿車的臥車相似，不同的就是稍微寬大一點。小票車不但走得慢，車身也小得多。　　哈長車最特别的就是沒有小販，乘客如果不在上車前帶來食物，遇到肚子餓了時，只有等火車停在車站上以後，下了車到車站上的小舖去買，但車站上只有一家舖子，價錢很大。</p>
<p>這條路經過的地帶，也是大平原，土脈肥沃，農產物豐富，比南滿綫的平原好得多。大豆，是沿綫主要的農產品，自從去年，雅片也現身在這大平原上了，可惜臨到我坐車經過時，都割去了，不然還可以看看罌粟花是生得什麽樣。</p>
<p>有幾個小車站的站房被焚毁了，只剩下殘破的遺痕挺在那兒，它們是抗日戰爭下的殉難者，蓬蒿漸漸高長，有些藤蘿都爬上它們的殘軀了。</p>
<p>哈長綫上的站房，個個都是挺出堅强結實的胸膛，但又多露出一些笨像，比起南滿路上一些精緻的建設來，正代表出兩者絕然不同的特色。</p>
<p>沒有鐵絲網，沙袋，裝設在車站上，大旣是不怕遭人暗算，其實，義勇軍並不是他們的敵人，當然不需防禦物的。</p>
<p>老少溝車站附近地方的風景很好，山嶺連綿，火車蜿蜒爬行，一轉眼工夫就别換出一副天地。松花江鐵橋，可說是這條路的大工程，這裏山水相映，也是個美妙的地方。</p>
<p>黃頭髮黃眼珠的年靑姑娘，每個車站上辦事室裏差不多都有她們的影子，有時在站臺上笑着，跳躍着，她們是時代上的新女性，她們都到社會上來服務了。</p>
<p>乘過這路火車的人，一定忘記不了一個建築獨特的車站，那就是雙城堡。這車站的站房不但形式特别，所用材料也和别個車站房舍不一樣，總之，修築得是太好了，哈爾濱車站都趕不上呢。</p>
<p>小票車總是擁擠的，乘客多是勞苦羣衆，和一般小市民，票價比大票車减少四五元錢。但大票車也還是擁擠的，每天每種車從長春哈爾濱兩地對開一次，想來這是乘客擁擠的原因。</p>
<p>三岔河是一個大站，兩旁糧棧很多，這裏是糧實集合的地方，冬天糧車常常擠成一串一串的。站房旁邊，聽說日本兵還投過幾個炸彈，在進攻哈爾濱以前。</p>
<p>哈長路上有一件對於窮苦乘客很合宜的設置，就是在每個車站上都沒有開水箱，車停後乘客下車可以隨便取水，不取分文，特别是夏天，買不起汽水喝的人，開水還是少不得的。</p>
<p>這條路，現在日本帝國主義正要强買呢。後事如何靜待分解。</p>
<h3>知了世界</h3>
<p>— 鄧當世</p>
<p>中國的學者們，多以爲各種智識，必出於聖賢，或者至少是學者之口；連火和草藥的發明應用，也和民衆無緣，全由古聖王一手包辦，燧人氏，神農氏。所以，有人以爲「一若各種智識，必出諸動物之口，斯亦奇矣」，是毫不足奇的。</p>
<p>况且、「出諸動物之口」的智識，在我們中國，也常常不是眞智識。天氣熱得要命，窗門都打開了，裝着無綫電播音機的人家，便都把音波放到街頭，「與民同樂」。咿咿唉唉，唱呀唱呀。外國我不知道，中國的播音，竟是從早到夜，都有戲唱的，牠一會兒尖，一會兒沙，只要你願意，簡直能够使你耳根沒有一刻淸凈。同時開了風扇，喫着冰淇淋，不但和「水位大漲」「旱象已成」之處毫不相干，就是和窗外流着油汗，整天在掙扎過活的人們的地方，也完全是兩個世界。</p>
<p>我在咿咿唉唉的曼聲高唱中，忽然記得了法國詩人拉芳丁的有名的寓言··「知了和螞蟻」。也是這樣的火一般的太陽的夏天，螞蟻在地面上辛辛苦苦地作工，知了却在枝頭高吟，一面還笑螞蟻俗。然而秋風來了，凉森森的一天比一天凉，這時知了無衣無食，變了小癟三，却給早有準備的螞蟻敎訓了一頓。這是我在小學校「受敎育」的時候，先生講給我聽的。我那好像很感動，至今有時還記得。</p>
<p>但是，雖然記得，却又因了「畢業卽失業」的敎訓，意見和螞蟻已經很不同。秋風是不久就來的，也自然一天凉比一天，然而那時無衣無食的，恐怕倒正是現在的流着油汗的人們；洋房的周圍固然靜寂了，但那是關緊了窗門，連音波一同留住了火爐的暖氣，遙想那裏面，大約總依舊是咿咿唉唉，「謝謝毛毛雨」。</p>
<p>「出諸動物之口」的智識，在我們中國豈不是往往不適用的麽？</p>
<p>中國自有中國的聖賢和學者。「勞心者治人，勞力者治於人；治於人者食（去聲）人，治，人者食於人，」說得多麽簡截明白。如果先生早</p>
<p>將這敎給我，我也不至於有上面的那些感想，多費紙筆了。這也就是中國人非讀中國古書不可的一個好證據。</p>
<h3>新絲</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>答耳耶先生　－從此完事－</h3>
<p>— 余揚靈</p>
<p>耳耶先生跟我討論金聖嘆批改的水滸問題，一開頭就封我做「金聖嘆底私淑弟子」，這就不給我留一點開口的餘地，因此我也不想多說話了，只來約略說幾句，從此完事。</p>
<p>第一，耳耶先生所用的「尊貴者羣底意識」，是什麽意思？指的是尊貴者羣所有的一切意識呢？還是尊貴者羣擁護他們自己那個羣的意識？若是前者，那是根本無從說起了，同是尊貴者羣，有的要維持自己的羣，有的却要反叛自己的羣，這個意識眞是莫明其妙了。於是豈止金聖嘆而已矣乎，封建地主的託爾斯泰，資產階級的左拉，都成了一無可取的人了，他們雖然批判他們的本階級，然而也是「尊貴者羣」的意識呀！不過，這樣的論調也就成爲無意思了。</p>
<p>假如「尊貴者羣底意識」是指擁護尊貴者羣的意識而言呢，那麽，金聖嘆是沒有這樣的意識的，七十四回水滸，明明是「誨盜」之作。</p>
<p>這里就說到第二個問題了，金聖嘆對於宋江的批評應作怎樣的解釋呢？我說··「他把故事中寫得十分忠義，惟盼望招安的宋江，奚落得一文不値。」耳耶先生疑心我所「讀的是另一種金批水滸」。他以爲金氏所奚落的乃是「十分假忠假義，拿願受招安騙人而實際甘心做强盜的宋江」。關於這，耳耶先生實在該去讀一讀「另一種水滸」，即一百二十回本。在一百二十回本中，宋江是完全被寫得十分忠義的，說宋江的忠義是虚僞的，倒是金聖嘆有意爲之的，金聖嘆爲什麽要把故事中十分忠義的宋江批成虚僞呢，這很明白，金聖嘆是反對接受招安的，他贊成李逵似的眞强盜，不滿於宋江的和統治階級藕斷絲連的態度，所以故意把宋江寫成虚僞，使讀者憎惡他。這還不够，索性連實行投誠的後半部也删掉了。這種用心，只要稍微仔細一</p>
<p>點，就不難看出的。</p>
<p>總而言之，七十回本的水滸是「誨盜」的小說，當日屬於尊貴者羣的金聖嘆，因爲在尊貴者羣中不能得志，因而激成反尊貴者羣的意識，有意誨盜，所以他的意識，已不能說是尊貴者羣的意識了。這是我的結論。</p>
<p>至於「朝廷」云云，那是金聖嘆的時代所限定的話。「豹子比作「無父無君」的人似乎是駡强盜，其實也不然。這道理我不想明說了。耳耶先生如有暇，倘肯把七十回本水滸再觀一次，看看金聖嘆對有父有君的宋江和無父無君的李逵，孰表同情，這一定是會看出許多道理來的。</p>
<h3>霧裏</h3>
<p>— 沙明</p>
<p>黃昏時底街頭是這麽一片的沉寂；五月底園子裏的白薔薇悄悄地暗自吐出幽香，深巷裏來往的人拖着懶散的脚步，天空裏一層灰色的濃烟又壓在樹梢上，冬靑樹漸漸地變成晦黯了。</p>
<p>這裏——</p>
<p>朦朧的街燈就穿進林子裏去。</p>
<p>孩子在蜿蜒的田塍上奔着歸程，從靉靆的雰圍中望着倚門底母親，那蒼白臉是愈加糢糊起來··</p>
<p>年靑的心忐忑着是多麽的争迫啊！受底撫摩却把惆悵的情緒帶走了，在晶瑩的燈光前露出勝利的微笑。</p>
<p>底細的故事勝過切切的私語；於是這孩子凝神在母親底譚話中。然而濃烟是彌漫着，氤氲着，從外面流進窗子裏漸漸佔據了屋子底一角；但這喃喃地聲音是無絲毫的倦意繼續下去。這夜孩子夢着靑色的花，它簪在母親底鬢邊燦爛地閃爍着··</p>
<p>這便是夢底開始。</p>
<h3>一座牆（二）</h3>
<p>— Ｒｏｂｅｒｔｏ　Ｂｒａｃｃｏ原著席滌塵譯</p>
<p>「爲什麽沒有。」</p>
<p>「我不曾拿到手。」</p>
<p>「那末怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>「稍爲忍耐一些，你就會睡着的。」</p>
<p>他們倆個，交替地說着聽着，先把嘴按到牆上，然後再將耳朶凑到牆上；兩個都做着手勢，彷彿彼此自以爲可以輪流看得見對方。他們繼續談話。</p>
<p>「好女子，我忍耐也沒有用處。旣然你要知道，我就吿訴了你吧。我並不要睡，我也要工作。我也得要工作。」</p>
<p>「那又有什麽東西阻碍了你呢？」</p>
<p>「就是你那縫衣機的聲音。我的思想散亂，我的腦子發暈。我連眼睛前面的紙頭都看不淸了。在平日，我倒工作慣，辛苦慣，就是四週閙翻天我也會寫的，但在可詛咒的今晚上，你那縫衣機的聲音却使得我心煩，使得我發狂。」</p>
<p>「那末等到早晨再寫罷，先生，到早晨我也做好了。」</p>
<p>「你自己等到早晨做好了。」</p>
<p>「我已經對你說過，我不能等。」</p>
<p>「我也不能等。」</p>
<p>「那末，先生，想法子到另外一間房去工作吧。」</p>
<p>「正像你一栤，我也祗有一間房。我打陽臺上進出的。要如我露天工作的話，我要死了。我身體極不好呢。」</p>
<p>「可憐的人呀，我對不起你！」</p>
<p>「啊，旣對不起，你又不肯帮我些忙。」</p>
<p>「請恕我吧，先生。要如你知道……」</p>
<p>「知道什麽」？</p>
<p>「一點鐘之内，我這非縫不可的東西一定要完工　——否則……」</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>否則不論滿淸政府覆亡與否，中國所受的外惠和内亂，總可比如今好一些！</p>
<p>他所穿的旅行的服裝，當然又和那些隨駕大臣是不同的··他的一件箭衣是天藍色的緞子所製的，上面用金綫繡着無數的長壽字；這件衣服的尺寸對於他的身量是很吻合的，穿着極適體，加上了他那淸秀的面貎，眞好算是一個翩翩美少年了。在這件箭衣的外面，他還有一件沒有袖子的背心穿着，也是緞子做的，不過是黑色的，這上面也同樣用金綫繡着許多的長壽字；但是依我看來，這件背心實在是多餘的，而且在這黑色的背心的外面伸出了兩支藍色的長袖，可說是難看極了。</p>
<p>大凡富貴人家，不論男女，十九都是愛用金銀珠寳裝飾品的，惟有光緖，却絕對的厭惡這些東西；他這個古怪的脾氣之養成，當然是多分受着惡劣環境和種種不加意的遭遇的影響，只要稍明事理的人，都能估料得到。但是每一朝的皇帝究竟該用多少金銀珠寳的裝飾物，宫裏頭原也不曾有這種特殊的祖訓規定着，祇憑各人自己歡喜而已，因此也就沒有人能去干預光緖爲什麽不用這些東西了！可是在他所戴的那頂黑緞製的瓜皮小帽上，却有一顆龍眼大小的珠子綴着，那地位恰好是在他的眉心的上面；這顆珠不但很大，而且晶瑩光潔，迥異凡品，嵌在這一頂烏黑的小帽上，越發閃爍動人。然而光緖的所以用這顆珠，却决不是爲着求好看，而是含着一種紀念的作用。在他平時的神情中，不難發現他這個用意；可是他實在紀念的是誰，那就不能武斷了。他的帽頂上還有一個用紅色的絲綫所打就的結子，和一掇尺許長的紅纓，都是非常的鮮艶奪目。（八一）</p>
<h3>炎天隨筆</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>氷旗的影，飛在熱風裏，倒舞在融化如爛瘡的柏油路上，車輪由赤着雙脚的人兒攆過，車上人感到了一種視欲，看看太陽那麽白，梧桐蔭裏又沒有綢衫子飄，自己的肉軀，像浸入了沸水裏，一陣子的汗漿，從皮膚裏分泌出，黏答答的，够不爽快！於是跳下車，大踏步的瞳進了飲冰室。車夫站在門外期待着！要是一條短褲，一雙拖鞋墆午寢在一雙拖鞋，午寢在綠芭蕉的凉蔭下，看一個蜘蛛慢慢地掛下銀絲，那蜘蛛又跟着風浪，一吹吹向屋檐的另一角，又一吹吹上楊柳枝，老是一來一往，組織它精緻的絲宫，而在空間飄盪的恣態，眞是多麽悠閒，多麽自在！</p>
<p>蒼蒲和靑艾，在端午節左右就被割掉了。現在兩岸全露了紫色的泥，早晨潮退，岸邊滿佈了龜蝦，蹲着不動，柳蔭正覆住它們。柳枝上噪着熱蟬、遠格，近格；聲音很恊調；當近格的歌唱休息之頃，遠格的却接着吟唱。要是這個時候，有一匹漁船，打着急漿，漁翁一邊唱山歌一邊搖近來的話，那蟬聲立刻會悠然而息，陸上龜蝦，也都搬動軀體，龜是慢慢地踱進水中，蝦却一跳跳進水中去了。</p>
<p>鄕村裏的孩子赤着膊，光着腿，滿身炙出了㾦瘰，故都搽白色的粗粉，然而他們感不到熱，爲了熱更加歡喜，恰如下妇天對於他們是一樣的興味－他們去追逐花間的蝴蝶，去看浸在河中撈蝦的漁人，去墳山蕩裏拾貝壳；汗在流，滿嘴蒸發着熱氣，然而他們快樂。</p>
<p>都市在熱的漩渦裏，鄕村也在熱的漩渦裏。可是鄕村的娘兒們，趁都市小姐喝冰水與愛人講紅色的夢話時，「個個趕到田野裏去刈草莽去了。你不見伊們所戴的圓笠子上籠着整個的銀色的太陽？</p>
<h3>兩分鐘内的兩種心理</h3>
<p>— 容與</p>
<p>一路電車匀匀整整地坐滿了一車人，向東開行，到麥特赫同脫路，上來了一位某國婦人，右手攙着一個頭紥綳布的小孩。在一般情狀下，有婦人上車，我大都總站起來讓坐，而這一天不過只要稍爲擠攏一些，很可容納一個人的坐位，何况伊還攙了一個帶病的小孩呢。</p>
<p>可是不然，我看見這位婦人，本意地就不願讓伊坐，而和我並坐的一個同胞，却正和我一樣的心理，他並且故意把脚分開一些，直接的對伊表示拒絕。同時我腦筋裏，映着不久以前報紙上登載的約翰大學的卓君，爲讓坐而被無理性的西洋婦人向法院起訴的一幕，這時我受着國族性的驅使，我和我的座位，格外密接了一些。</p>
<p>兩分鐘以後，車快到卡德路了，這一段裏的軌道，有兩個連接的彎曲，車身便劇烈地振蕩起來。說也可憐，那位沒有坐位的婦人，因爲天性的祖傳的矮了一些，竟攀不到車上動蕩的籐圈，假使我不去拉伊一把，說不定伊會拖了伊的小孩，一同衝到車箱外面去。我這時由國族的仇視心，一變而爲人類的同情心，很爽快的站起來讓伊坐下去。</p>
<p>本質上這婦人和我絲毫沒有仇恨，只爲他們野心的軍閥欺壓了我國，便把人類天性的美德－同情心蒙蔽了。這是極藐小的例子，最多不過使這婦人和小孩跌了一交。</p>
<h3>往那裏走？</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>趙太太别傳</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>趙太太是個十足的中國太太典型。今年伊已有五十多歲，頭髮也半白了。兩條腿兒，細得像筆管一般。鞋頭裏的棉絮，至少要塞上全鞋三分之一，因此走起路來，像小雞般一跳一跳，怪好看的。</p>
<p>趙太太雅好修飾。每次出外，打扮的時間，足足要耗去一兩點鐘。對鏡忍痛拔去灰白色的短髮，及用烏煤染黑伊的呌長不長，呌短不短的髮絲，都是成爲主要的工作。伊還時常搽過什麽生髮油，烏髮藥水之類，而慨歎於東洋貨的百試百效，可惜現在已沒得買了。</p>
<p>趙太太喜人造絲綢和五顏六色的洋布。據說，一因價廉；一因色澤光艶，足以减輕伊的年齡。趙太太飯量並不大，可是伊吃零食的本領眞不小。買時，伊眞「兇來兮」，能扣一個銅板，卽受盡賣者的苦求，甚至冷嘲熱諷，伊也不睬眯；或者說一句「下次再補」，就算了。</p>
<p>趙太太對待婢僕自以爲很仁慈的，可是他們偶忤伊的意，伊總要把他們駡上一兩點鐘，甚或要駡得他們涕泗滂沱方休。趙太太自以爲肯行好事的，可是黃包車夫哀求伊加個銅板，伊便要「柳眉倒豎」了。</p>
<p>趙太太相信求籤問卜下，尤喜和尼巫交往。趙太太雖不識字，可是打起麻將來，從未會有失誤。趙太太愛和小白臉談話，雖然伊的内心是很純潔的。趙太太喜聽風情話，這大槪因伊的丈夫忙抽雅片之故。</p>
<p>趙太太的淑行尚多，一時也說不盡，總之，伊是個十足的中國太太典型。</p>
<p>拉雑話</p>
<h3>談熱帶花魚（下）</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>（十）黑花縞魚Ｈｅｔｅｒａｎｄｒｉａ　Ｆｏｒｍｏｓａ產於北加羅利亞及富羅利達等處的池沿中，長僅一寸三四分，從頭部到尾部，有黑暗色的粗紋，背脊上有黑色斑點，其習性與尖頭鰷魚相同。（十一）佳羅丹乃爾魚Ｊｏｒｄａｎｅｌｌａ　Ｆｌｏｒｉｄａｅ產於富羅利達溪流，形似小鯽魚，體爲綠色滿布黑斑，雄魚又有紅斑，鱗形似鶴羽。（十二）縞馬紋魚Ｃｈａｎｃｈｉｔｏ產自巴西，自背至腹，有縱縞五條並列，亦名花猪魚，形似黃魚，但長祗有二三寸，這魚的習性，好像小猪的喜歡喧閙，其與他魚不同的特點，不像他魚噬食已產的仔卵。（十三）天使魚Ｓｃａｌａｒｅ又稱Ｈａｌｆ－ｍｏｏｎ產於埃馬松河與南美溪澗中，其姿態奇美，體像倉扁魚，背鰭與胸鰭蜉三角形，有美麗縞紋，胸鰭生二根灰白色長綫，生長於六十五度以上的水温中。（十四）寳石魚Ｒｅｄ－Ｃｈｒｏｍｌｄｅ，體爲紅色，亦有帶靑褐色的，咽喉部分爲大紅，全身密布斑點，尾鰭的根，與鰓邊，有三大黑點，色彩鮮艶，與寳石相類，能生活於六十度内外的水温。（十五）黑縞魚Ｂｌａｃｋ　ｂａｎｄｅｄ　ｃｈｒｏｍｉｄｅ產自巴西，習性與寳石魚同，全身爲黑褐色的縞紋，惟胸鰭爲赤色。（十六）口孵魚Ｍｏｕｔｈ　Ｂｒｅｅｄｅｒ產自非洲埃及，形似　小鯽，最大者不過二寸能在口中，孵化卵子，全身有金黃色藍色的光澤，臀鰭爲紅色，能生活於六十八度内外的水濫中。（十七）細絲魚ｐｙｒｒｈｕｌｌｎａ亦產南美，形似口孵魚，惟色彩稍遜，雌魚產卵時，躍出水面，在岸邊產卵。（十八）極樂魚ｐａｒａｄｉｓｅ　ｆｉｓｈ產于亞西亞東南及非洲，使爲扁平，鰭甚發達，鰭端如散絲，全身褐色，有直縞數條，間以紅縱藍等色彩，生存于五十度内外至九十度的高温中。（十九）克拉为魚Ｇｒｏｕａｍｉ產于印度及馬拉羣島，長僅一寸四五分，體有橙黃色藍色的縞紋，亦有紅藍相間的縞紋，能似蛙鳴。（二十）鬥魚Ｆｉｇｈｔｉｎｇ　ｆｉｓｈ產于暹羅，性格好鬥，體似極樂魚而扁平，胸鰭甚大，尾爲放射狀綫，有紅綠紫紗等色，暹羅以這魚賭博輸贏，且課高率輸出稅。又有登木魚Ｃｌｉｍｂｉｎｇ　ｐｅｒｃｈ能飛躍岸上，爬登樹木。步行魚Ｗａｌｋｎｇ　ｆｉｓｈ能跳到海邊，甲胸鰭在砂上行走。蝶魚Ｂｕｔｔｅｒｒｌｙｆｉｓｈ胸鰭非常發達，與蝴蝶相類，常常飛出水面，故亦名飛行魚，其他種類甚多，因限于篇幅，不及枚舉。</p>
<p>（二）飼育法飼育熱帶魚，與飼養金魚法相同，惟有特别習性的魚，須在魚池上面，蓋以鐵絲網以防躍出，至於水温應當保持六十度以上，但自初夏至初秋，儘可自然放任，初冬以後，那要有特别温室裝置了。普通用炭火，煤爐亦可，或利用電熱與熱水汀，尢爲適宜，惟須用水温表測星水温的高下，喂飼食物，與金魚相同，如孑　，紅虫，貝類，蠶蛹，麵類，蛋黃粉等，不過這等花魚，初從河川捕來，很不慣于狹小的魚缸中生活，應該建設寬大的魚糟的，使其游泳自由的。</p>

<p>正慌亂着呢？在烟霧裏面，只見田靑督率四名弟兄，搶着抬了一架機關槍過來，就在炸塌的斜坡上，架着對了敵人便放。卜卜卜，一陣掃射，衝鋒的敵人，倒排竹也似，一連串的落地。自强緩過這口氣，一看這堡城上，七橫八竪，全是陣亡的士兵。還拿着槍守住垜口的，共總不能到二百人。所幸攻守兩軍現在接觸得很密切，那兩架擾亂的飛機，恐怕抛下炸彈，炸傷了自己的人，已經飛去了，依然成了雙方步軍對峙的狀態。不過原來打算衝鋒的人，雖然是止住了，但是認這個口子是不能放鬆，他們仗着器械精良，已有三架機關槍對了這口子射擊。自强也是瞪着眼望了城下，偶然一回頭，見田靑身子倒插着，伏在那斜坡上，突口而出，不由呌了一聲田連長。他突然的一跳，跳到垜口裏，身子又向下一倒，睜了眼道··老趙，你說，咱們東北人有好的嗎？你說！自强兩手早是抱住了他，騰出一隻手來，伸了大拇指道··有好的！田靑微睜了眼睛，點點頭，笑着和老趙吿别了。自强心裏這番悲痛，自是不必說。抱了田靑的忠骸，許久作聲不得。忽聽得寳芳喊道··西門槍響了，我們去看看。自强放下田靑，回頭看時，寳芳咬着牙，兩雙眼睛，又紅又大，看了倒有些怕人。他向堡城子兩回一望，見還有百十來名弟兄，一面跳下堡子裏，一面對自邊的號兵道··吹集合號！號兵將號連吹了幾聲，那些在城堡上的弟兄們，都端了槍跑到炸彈轟燬的屋基空地上來站着。（四三二）</p>

<h3>棉花多頭獲利出籠</h3>
<p>棉市晨間開盤、漲風益熾、以美棉續漲二十五磅音、買方乘勢加碼、因此漲風殊濃、但市盤一高、詎料多頭獲利、大批出籠、檯面突然轉鬆、陳棉平平、新棉因氣候亢旱、市情較堅云、</p>

<h3>美棉續漲之主因　旱區依然缺…投機家買力頗强</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因利物浦消息良好、旱區缺雨、投機家買進、市况堅定活潑、結果現貨漲二十五磅音、期貨漲二十一至二十五磅音、英棉期貨漲二十一　　　棉初因　洲出口商買進而堅、後因多頭　　　、結而回、結果　　爾漲　羅比、奥姆辣漲四羅比七角半、白羅溪漲五羅比、原電錄左、（十日電）</p>

<h3>糧食粉市重轉好面</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份復呈俏俐之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好二四角左右、坎拿大好一二角不等、當開價後、業内外人心、因天時依然亢旱、内地帮心思、亦爲米價之鋒俏、久寂思動、故開價市面、較前日計漲一二分不等、旋幸各廠方面、爲緩和人心起見、仍見陸續抛售、以此種套售、爲廠家之正式交易、非若業外之賣空買空、毫無根拋、是以人心雖呈騰達、漲度尚屬和緩、且與開價市面、亦曾回落近分、此後如得天從人願、大沛甘霖、緊張之局、或能從此平定也、結果本月份較好七釐半、八月份好一分、九月份好一分七釐半、十月份好一分半、十一月份好一分二釐半、十二月份好一分七釐半、</p>
<h3>囤户繼續收進期麥又見盤高</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近疲遠定之局、本月份開價、因北路客户套售之餘風、以及現貨到源、並未因天旱而减少、故人心尚見平定、遠期終以天旱之故、人心老住、開價穩定、迨至下午開盤、以上午粉市略好、業外心思、又復轉堅、且囤户之購買、仍聞陸續收進、故各盤市面、又見向上盤高矣、結果八九月份較前日各好三分、十月份好二分、十一月份好三分、現麥到貨尚旺、各廠去胃、頗有貪勢、高貨提好一二分、開徐州麥三元零八分、歸德麥三元零九分、宿州五河麥三元零七分、瑤灣臨淮關麥三元零五分、蚌埠麥三元零六分、江新州麥二元八角八分、至九角二分、六合麥二元九角一分、大橋麥二元九角半、揚州麥二元九角半、次九角三分、由福新去一萬包、阜豐去二千包、信大去二千包、申大去一千包云、</p>
<h3>河米有到回落二角　惟變元貨乏獨好</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源略多、計到二十六七號、（數約四千餘石）、銷塲忽見轉淡、市况自初市開手直至收市、形勢無甚進展、除常帮粳以貨乏尚帶秀色外、餘如蘇同南港等價俱見跌落一二角不等、而靑角泗涇西練等晚稻中次者亦落二三角、僅杜洋尖無榮辱、變元貨乏胃香、獨秀四五角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下千帮來源十五六號、市上各貨去路因天時炎熱、各店上市寥寥、致云胃淸淡、市形白粳定中轉疲、白元到少銷呆、價緊一二角、薄粳及各尖和平之勢、</p>
<h3>洋客秈本客採購近萬包</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况又活、因邇日天時酷熱、久旱不雨、河廠各米一律價昂、且以内地河道乾涸、來源中阻、市上人心一致向上、洋客秈因此亦頗活潑、交易雖未逾萬、然以各地客户問津、市氣頗俏、統市成交機糙各秈六千包、小絞二千包、去路以本街與囤户最貪、其他爲内地·寗波·崇明各帮均有應酬、因此小絞又自八元至八元一角、其他各秈一律挺站、後首如到頭不旺、去化再活、市價或須步升也、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論中國文學遺產問題</h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>—讀「文學」二卷六期「中國文學遺產專號」有感—</p>
<p>不久「文學」二卷六期出了一本「中國文學遺產專號。」他們要以新的方法，新的眼光，對中國文學遺產，加以一個新的估量，新的解剖。他們相信，在中或文學遺產裏，假使肯以新的眼光，新的方法，去加以一番新的估量，新的解剖，一定能够得到許多很好的材料。這無數量的中國文學遺產，雖是像一片黃沙的蕪雜，但其中黃金的砂礫是非常的多。假使我們肯用下一番工夫，其收穫是一定非常豐富的。這是他們所以要提出整理中國文學遺產接受中國文學遺產的一個理由。</p>
<p>中國文學遺產是非常豐富的。谊一點，我們並不否認。中國文學遺產，確實也只有以新的方法、新的眼光，才能整理出解剖出一些新的材料；這些材料，對於我們是非常有益的。這一點，我們也不否認。然而，整理中國文學遺產，接受中國文學遺產，是不是這個時候的事呢？中國文學遺產，是應該加以整理的，接受的，然而中國文學遺產，是不是這個時候應該去整理他，接受他的。這倒不能不多少有點疑問。</p>
<p>中國文學遺產，始終是遺產。中國文學遺產，無論如何豐富，偉大，始終是過去了的文學。中國文學遺產，無論如何値得我們今日的整理，接受，然而這遺產對於我們今日的工作是無益的。中國文學遺產，其内容是廣博的，其中有無數量的黃砂也好，金砂也好，這些東西，對於我們今日的需要，是一點沒有關係。爲什麽呢？因爲目前這個時代，是客觀現實的矛盾高漲到了頂點的時代。這個時代，一切方面，都在十分緊張的矛盾的激流中。矛盾代表了目前的一切。這樣，其所表現出來的，無論是社會方面，文化方面，都應該是一切矛盾的代表點。這樣，這社會，這文化，才不失其時代的意義。然而這些在中國文學遺產裏是沒有的。中國文學遺產，儘是豐富，儘是可貴，但絕不能與這個時代相配合，被這個時代所採用一些什麽。這樣，這整理中國文學遺產問題，在目前便完全變成無意義。這不過是幾個人避免矛盾避開時代的一個很技巧的方法而已。什麽整理中國文學遺產，接受中國文學遺產，顚倒是嚇嚇人的。在這裏面，我們看到有什麽更充實的内容呢？</p>
<p>中國文學遺產，是値得整理的，應該整理的，然而至少要在客觀現實的矛盾稍稍减弱了以後。而這個時候，則絕對需要表現矛盾解决矛盾的文學。整理中國文學遺產接受中國文學遺產，在這個時候，應該解釋作是避免矛盾，怕接近矛盾。然而矛盾也終將轢死了他們。</p>
<h3>刹那的印象</h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>把一頂古舊的呢帽戴在頭上，把兩手埋在大衣袋裏，把一顆焦急的心藏在白襯衫下，就這樣，我跳上了從細雨中穿過來的第一路電車。</p>
<p>在稀落的搭客之羣中坐了下來，揩乾了眼睛上的雨點，我面前便浮現出一對女性的大眼，我向這大眼和生着這大眼的人打量起來！</p>
<p>如果把這生物當價一個雕塑品看時，這應當是由於一個不使人失望的雕刻師做成的。那線條，是的，那線條多匀凈！多柔和！沒有一塊粗製濫造的痕跡，不管這鑑賞的人是聰明的抑是愚蠢的，他總不會在這裏得了不滿意的印象去。但如把這生物當作一幅美術畫而鑑賞時，這情形却又兩樣了··腮帮上兩塊鮮紅會使人疑到畫師是敷了過度的油彩。一片烏雲似的頭髮却又嫌他太短，太短，倘若畫師不偷懶的話，再加上一兩筆就可和那椭圓形的面部搆成很美的此例了。面部是白色的，却也不使人生厭，襯托着那紫色的長袍也是很宜雅的色調，不過下半截的敷設是多餘的，最好是平穩地描出個半身，從腰部以下都用較濃的油彩塗抹了去。而這油彩如果有騰餘的話，更可塗些到那並不討厭的大眼上去，因爲無論從色澤上看，抑是從形狀上看，這眼睛是需要一些更精細的修飾的……</p>
<p>在幻想着，這生物動起來了。面向着我。她的眼光嚙着我的眼光，我惶恐地低下頭去。</p>
<p>低下頭去該想些什麽呢？把我的心當價了殖民地。這影象的勢力漸漸龐大地生長起來了。被侵略者是需要反抗的，此是我再度地揚起頭來。</p>
<p>而她的頭是不好意思地偏偏過去。</p>
<p>在勝利中，一個念頭忽然在我心中生長起來，沒有個伴，幾年來就是這麽到處飄泊着，懷了一顆無黏着的心，在中國許多村鎭許多口岸上印下了自己的足跡。看年光逐着車塵向前催，玲惜地</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>撕下日曆的每一頁子。在這春夏之交的季節中，每個人心裏應當都爲快樂所漲滿，可是，游子的家園呢？游子的家園呢？</p>
<p>車水馬龍的街衢上，明亮的廚窗中已經擺上多骨的小洋傘了吧？髹漆得很好傢具，該在每一個温適的家庭中有着牠的位置了吧？粤菜館的點心與淸茶是每每令人感到悠閑的坐茶室的氣分的。此外則夜公園裏有櫻紅的燈，舞塲裏有淡紫的，丁香色的燈，栢樹冬靑橋蔭庇的馬路上有白各礸石的燈，都市的享樂感，往往是只能飄向那含着笑頰的人們的懷中的。</p>
<p>像是天畔的流空一般，我輕流出自己迷朦的思想。</p>
<p>面對看瑩澈的一對大眼，我不禁把　想另牽到另一對更其明倩的大眼上去　那是在海的另一邊，有微風輕輕扇着的地方　那　藏着我私自祝福的人。</p>
<p>可是我們距離得是如此遠，望望車窗外的天邊，天邊正降着霏霏的雨，輕軟如珠子的廉幕，「是夏天了」我下意識地自語着··「可是我心裏並不感覺温暖呢！」</p>
<p>那對眼睛使得我生愁呢，而且還有那雨，那擾人恩緖的，牽引我回憶衣角的雨絲啊！</p>
<h3>欣賞的距離</h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>你也曾有過這經騐？剛好袋裏的錢空了，剛好一個朋友慫恿你去看電影。於是，怎樣？只好去借……是的，有了那麽一點點……馬馬虎虎混進去，只要看了就算了。</p>
<p>就在這麽個情形下我看過了「娜娜」。我的債主恰巧也是我這麽個窮鬼－同樣羽毛的鳥才能飛到一顆樹上呵—他東凑西凑的凑了六角大洋，羞慚地塞到我一隻汗濕濕的手裏。</p>
<p>在多少熟人生人目光的護送下，我們總算在前幾排找到了二個座位，不一刻，黑暗把這二個窮苦而誠意的美的崇拜者帶進藝術的世界裏。</p>
<p>可是我們坐得太近了，把幕上的一切皆在距離不合度的情形下弄歪曲了，什麽都看不見，是一團扁的綫條在眼前幌。</p>
<p>爲什麽？除了視覺的反應外，因爲坐得離布幕實在太近了的緣故。美的工具奪去了我領略美的氛圍和情調的機會。</p>
<p>我才懂得欣賞藝術「距離」是要的。　　然而這距離並不限於物的方面，心理上的距離更有同樣的需要。</p>
<p>有人說會嗅味的是冷鼻子；會辨色的是冷眼。這「旁觀者淸」的說法並不違反科學。「熟」是朋友間的膠，却是欣賞藝術者的魔。牠會用凡俗的甚至不相干的記憶混擾我們對美的鑒賞。打　一張山水，如果能說這是個什麽地方自然會呌這　象具體化一點，甚至可以在想象中增補所缺少的一條橋或一座廟，然而正因爲這樣與實物連起來而糜損了藝術的作用。</p>
<p>我常看見朋友追問一幅畫的朝代和手筆。但一張中國畫放在一個外國人面前時，他只有把自己浸在，或者說丢失在畫境裏，摸索着那些象徵東主民族感情的一把綫，一堆點，一片顏色，以及相混相揉而成的這幅畫所給人的感覺。</p>
<p>我還看見一個法國女人把我們鄕下盛粥的大粗碗懸在她幽雅的客廳裏，合着掌，細細的玩味上面粗率單純的條紋。我曾捧腹笑過一個英國老頭子把我們中國麵館的招牌掛在書房裏。哈，「興泰館」！這東西帮助我記憶起油汚的桌面。而他却只在那上面欣賞那雄壯的筆鋒，與那金漆色澤的配合！</p>
<p>骨董家太重視了「眞」的時候，會輕忽了美。鑑賞家太熟習了藝術品本體一切的時候，會失去那點由朦朧而來的陶醉。</p>
<p>「藝術的陶醉並不由於那藝術品的……却由於鑑賞家不明白那東西的……」誰說這句話漂亮呢？不管是誰說的，應當有這樣一句眞話。</p>
<p>在許多地方，異國的情調曾受到比本國更厚重的賞識。我常懷疑勃克夫人在新大陸出版界的成功與這很有關係。並不全在好奇的滿足，乃是她能獲得她所安排下的美的效果。她的讀者在等候她的「刺戟」，而供給她所要的反應。他們沒有不馴的想像去由王龍往别人身上跳。如同「虎骨酒」（見少年革命者第四頁）給一個中國人也不過是一瓶貼了紅封條的專治跌打損傷跑江湖的弄來騙錢的藥酒而已。但給一個外國人，僅僅」虎骨」已足够感出一個壯健來了。</p>
<p>事實上、善於製作動人名詞的中國裏，只要把某些地方名稱譯出來，已够使許多不見世面的外國人忘形了。把虎門譯成Ｐｉｇｅｒ　Ｇａｔｅ會令人感出一種森嚴到不可接近的地步—而事實上是異國軍艦，出入自如。曾給歐美來華的旅客充過翻譯的會記得當他把「排雲殿」按字譯出時，聽者是多麽悠然飄逸！</p>
<p>每天黎明聽見附近軍營中吹給我的一個兵的心上就深沉得多了。</p>
<p>爲了熱，爲了實用，使我們不能深切地接近藝術。我們若想改善這困難，不在避免已有的阻碍，而在創出一個新的能力—卽是訓練我們神經的對美的反應，保持自己和藝術品的距離。在欣賞那刹那，排除與那美無關的奔馳。聽說美克安琪羅在殺人的時候，曾拿着小册子去寫罪犯恐怖的狀態。他冷冷的不起一點憫憐，在旁人看見有些不近人情，但却是保持距離的好例。</p>
<h3>故鄕</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>昨天晚上沒好好地睡過，太傷心了，涙珠在繡着一支箭穿過二顆心的枕頭处濕了一大片。天剛發光就披着衣服下牀了，頭昏得很。獨自庭中踱着，從這邊到那邊，呆一呆，又從那邊到這邊，又呆一呆％………</p>
<p>自己也不懂爲什麽這樣留戀着故鄕。農村經濟破產，故鄕也不能獨免；村人那種爲生活而呈現的憔悴的臉色與悲哀的嘆息，也非我所能容忍的；而且故鄕並沒有靑秀的山，淸漣幽靜的水，更沒有理想中那樣美麗可愛的景色。故鄕有的是癩痢頭似的山峯，折綫狀的水流；有的是悲哀，有的是黑暗。然而我總是留戀着故鄕，我講不出理由地留戀着故鄕。</p>
<p>我總想我能永遠在故鄕裏住下去。但這不過是理想而已。在我，理想和事實永遠是二條平行綫，决不會想交的。我留戀故鄕，我又不能不離開故鄕。我得到很遠的都市裏去求學。村裏的人個個都慫恿我離開故鄕，因爲我將來可以做官，賺錢，可以沾沾光。是的，他們永遠不會了解我的。他們都以爲求學的目的是做官，做官是很了不起的事；他們不會知道故鄕是可以留戀的，他們也不知道一個人的情感是可貴的。</p>
<p>然而我不能不離開故鄕。我望着魚白色的東方嘆息。掛在空中的半個月亮冷酷地照着大地。雞啼了，還夾着幾聲斷續的犬吠。</p>
<p>姑母也起來了，忙着替我燒飯。我望着她頭上隨着風搖的白髮，難過得很。砦在灶洞内劈劈拍拍地燒着。鍋裏的水也澌澌的響着。涙水又迷糊了我的眼睛。</p>
<p>我開了大門，走到屋後的曬穀塲上。一層薄薄的白霧遮沒了山和田野，只有黃金色的稻穗尚可依稀辨識。東方一大片緋紅的彩霞。每個屋頂都冒出一縷炊烟。幾條黃狗躺在地上望着木雞似的我。</p>
<p>姑母催喫飯的喚聲驚醒了我。太陽已經上山了，白霧也退了，四周的山根淸淅地射入眼簾。草上的露珠濕了我的鞋尖。我帶了麻木沉重的身體回家。</p>
<p>吃過了飯，無力地打點行裝。送行的興哥早來了，把行李做成一担，挑在肩上。</p>
<p>我拿着帽子，望着姑母，說不出話來。</p>
<p>「用功念書！」姑母囑咐着。我又望見她頭上的白髮了，我又含着涙。</p>
<p>人生爲什麽有那末許多傷心的事哪！</p>
<p>於是我走了。故鄕消朱在我的背後，這留在我底腦中，永遠地，永遠地。</p>
<h3>祈雨與禁屠</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>小時候不留心把飯米掉在地上，老祖母說天老爺要打雷的，那時候我以爲風雲雨雪都是所謂天老爺在主宰的。後來進小學，讀敎科書，知道雨露雪霜也，水也，一而已。把天老爺的觀念就此打破。</p>
<p>現在久旱不雨，頭頂上蒼蒼者旣不是天老爺，農民郤是忙着祈雨禁屠。然而不求根本辦法，所以無論前進作家的建設問題喊得應天價響，然而農民們沒有錢讀書是鐵一般的事實，而且喊口號的文人寗願拿稿費逛跳舞塲，坐咖啡館，建設，建設不過是嘴上衝鋒，我們的農民是祗能把老祖母的唸佛哲學虔誠地祈雨禁屠起來。</p>
<p>我想「前進作家」又該說些什麽？</p>

<h3>陶哥</h3>
<p>— 若金</p>
<p>陶哥，女性般的温柔，頑石似的固執，水門汀一樣地憂鬱。</p>
<p>「陶哥，你的理由是錯誤的。」但是陶哥從不肯吃癟不認錯。就如買花生米吧，花生米是陶哥的香烟，陶哥的酒，每天有癮的。在上海，六隻銅板買一包相當大的花生米自然算便易了，但是陶哥却說不，他忽略了說這個便易的時間與處間，他必須說南京的便宜，這個不便宜，結果人家讓步了，不和是人家不願意和他再辯了，於是陶哥得着一點小小的勝利，痛快了，但是愈痛快便愈陷於寂寞了。</p>
<p>可是另一方面，陶哥喜歡有一份寂靜的生活，並且願意獨自關在一間小房裏；我們有時覺得過份的岑寂會使人面皮黃，我們固意找兩三句話跟他談，替他解悶，但陶哥並不歡迎，看見我們的時候，立卽把正在抄謄的長信收藏了，原來陶哥的心是不寂寞的。</p>
<p>自從虹口公園的派斯過期以後，陶哥很少在外邊耽擱了，但是在過份沉悶的時際，他也會獨自跟蹌到燈炬輝騰的馬路上，一雙沒在襪子的脚在地上踏着詩人的慢步，也如駱駝。</p>
<p>「陶哥，沒有穿襪是沒在襪穿了嗎」？說這話的，在陶哥的敏感裏覺得有輕侮的意味，故而必須立予解釋，「現在的女人不穿襪，東洋人也不穿襪」。似乎穿襪的人在目下是有點落伍了。</p>
<p>星期六的晚上，附近的跳舞學堂裏據說有裸體舞會，大奶奶會碰着男人的鼻頭呢，陶哥想看一看究竟，但是終於沒有。</p>
<p>睡覺以前照例要抛一次籃球，關於這，實在包含了不盡苦衷的，房子是老式的，抽水馬桶又沒有，跑到外邊去，太遠，但自從發現火車路旁邊的新大陸之後，籃球也不大抛了。</p>
<p>睡覺，也跟我一樣地很軍事化的，大家都沒有床，睡在地板上。</p>
<p>後樓的板壁縫裏有時會爬出一個臭蟲。有時候會溜出一路快意的柔綿的歌聲，被禁了的桃花江，陶哥唱着桃花江是有着特殊的聲調的，大半是由於内心愉快之故。</p>
<p>但是有一天，他特别强調地沉鬱着了，吃飯也吃不下，睡在床上，據說要自殺了。</p>
<p>「陶哥，這消息該是可喜的，怎麽反而不快呢？未婚妻有身孕不是能够加速地促成結婚的實現嗎？况且她的來信祗說是有點惡心，想吐，那個沒有來是沒有到期，心裏是恐怕會有，那麽還說不定啦。「我們這樣勸慰他，他說有了怎麽呢？必須要結婚啦，結婚又沒有錢，中飯祇吃了一碗稀薄的麫。</p>
<p>三天很快地過去了，郵差終於帶來了好的消息，這就如一劑强性的藥，陶哥看着呌起來啦，不知道他的心事的人眞不能聽懂如後的話。</p>
<p>「沒有沒有，那個又來啦，她說的沒有」。</p>
<p>「陶哥，沒有嗎？來义小麻將吧。」陶哥心裏已經滿快活啦，想趁快活的餘興贏一點錢，以資吃花生米，發信…所以答應义就义。</p>
<p>陶哥义麻將到是很老槍，但老槍並不能一定贏錢，老槍輸了好幾搓五百搓　　「郵票細都輸掉啦」。陶哥摸着一隻空袋，袋裏沒有一點銅屑。但是這個並不會打消陶哥内心的快意，因爲他的未婚妻的那個又來啦。</p>
<p>被禁絕了的桃花江又從後樓的板縫裏一路一路的溜出了，聲調是怪别緻的，有着女性一樣的温柔。</p>

<h3>小毛的娘</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>小毛的娘的影子，又在後門裏消失了。</p>
<p>「廂房阿嫂··夜飯吃過末？」當她循着樓梯下來時，掠過一陣媚笑。小毛的娘是兩樣了，一個年頭的變化會這樣快。當她搬到這個屋裏時，一件印花自由布的衫兒；還是到臨近的電影院去才着上的。現在在鑲着白花邊紡綢背帶的外面裏。着透明紗的旗衫；讓起伏的乳峯顫動着。一雙擦着白鉛粉的網眼高跟鞋，上面裸着雪白的大腿。髮的波紋，像黃浦江艦隊的烟囱裏吐着氣。杏黃色的胭脂，腥紅的寇丹，小毛的娘在都市物質文明的煊染下；變成一個時代的夫人，在許多都市色情文化的巨靈下，搆成一般追逐者肉的偶像。</p>
<p>小毛的娘到上海來才一年，丈夫是長江輪船的生火伕，雖然在工人待遇極菲薄的現在，海員是同樣地被限制着。爲了小毛的爸人頭熟識的緣故，他兼做着帶貨生意。在最出色的幾個月裏，也有百來塊的收入。</p>
<p>在優裕的進益下，把小毛的娘塑成了一個城市夫人的偶像。小毛的娘，也像一般的城市夫人沉溺在賭。　　當丈夫在驚風駭浪的江上，握着煤剷向鐵鍋裏送，她在白熱的燈泡下，在紅木檯子上碰着牌。這樣把一個淳樸的小毛的娘，變成一個妖艶的女人。一個年靑的少婦，時常會感到性的飯渴的。在都市的夜生活裏，把小毛的娘跌入萬惡環境的陷阱中。</p>
<p>在先前她丈夫汗血的收入，是够這個小家庭撑脚了。女子虚榮的程度，會跟着時間加深。每一個人終不滿於現實的生活！她也時常跟着姊妹淘跑跑遊藝塲，一幕幕色情文化性生活的搬演；深深地鐫入了小毛娘的心坎。跟一個過着航行生活的丈夫，是並不幸福的；使她時常感覺到。</p>
<p>這樣使小毛娘墮落了！</p>
<p>「朋友··做做媒人好𠲎？」</p>
<p>她開始跑棧房的時候，臉上會掠過女人特有的羞怯。但是她所看到的同類是這樣多，嘗試以後；使她明瞭這是平凡的演出。</p>
<p>而且跟着這一般年靑的小夥子，自家兒是幸福的。他們有的是白胖胖的臉兒，光亮的頭髮，闊綽的服裝。至少，比小毛的爸要體面些。使她想到「好花插在牛糞堆」，自家兒跟着平凡的男人是一生一世享不到福。</p>
<p>還有白花花的洋錢，花綠綠的鈔票，她時常夢想着做了闊太太以後，這一幕薔薇色的憧憬。她恨小毛不懂事，以後准會吃苦的。時常噪着「媽；我跟妳一道出去。」而且到小毛的爸的船進了塢，她好像金絲籠裏的小鳥；不能在自由的天空翺翔！而且他也常會留意着失常以後的妻子，好在他居住的時候並不多，暫時的束缚，對於她已感到囚籠樣的封鎖。</p>
<p>小毛的娘沉淪在逸樂的性生活裏，每天從晞薄的晨霧裏，從黃包車上回到寓所。小毛的睡態怪濃厚的，從落地的着衣鏡裏；看到自己的靑春在消睡下去。她懶散地倒在小毛的脚後頭，温着昨夜甜蜜的夢。</p>

<h3>正天的煩惱着</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個初中的窮苦學生，因窮苦的關係，我正天誦讀，對於婚姻問題，可說一點都不知道，故我爲着婚姻，正天的煩惱着，請先生替我解决。</p>
<p>我在十歲的那年，由「父母之命，媒灼之言，」訂合一個不認識的鄕下女</p>
<p>子，她是目不識丁，而且性情很是强暴。故我决意同他解約。但我知道，必欲滿二十歲實足年齡方能自由行動。我目下有一個女友，我倆的性情很好，而她的家長，完全都允許，我的家長也是贊成的。不過她命我同她實行訂婚儀式，因爲她恐我不免欲變心的關係，我想不答應，一定要在情愛上面，發生裂痕。若訂婚人恐與前訂婚約有衝突。請先生！在近日申報業餘信箱詳細的指示我，敢祝。　　　　文安張雲谷頓首</p>
<p>答··解除父母代訂婚約，因須成年之後，但照民法原理，婚約應以當事人自由訂定爲原則，所以法律上並不强制你要履行父母代訂婚約。換句話說，該項婚約，若未得過你的同意，自然束縛不了你，你自有與他人訂立婚約之自由，但未成年人訂婚須得父母同意，恐怕這一點須發生麻煩耳。　　　　　編者</p>

<h3>藍嘉寳的心境（五）</h3>
<p>— 希雋</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>回到座位，又立刻抽着烟，喝着咖啡，平靜的珠子仍是平靜地瞅着地板。全不想把眼睛向這向那的挑頭，投着風情的笑，誘惑的笑，像别個那麽騷浪蕩地。</p>
<p>這一支曲子她可定坐着，音樂迅速地歇下來了。有個男子打從她的身旁走來，到她跟前，指縫的烟蒂不知怎的忽然摔落在她的袍子下擺那兒。可不知道是有意還是無意，那個連忙替她抖拂着，却已憤出了幾個小窟窿啦！</p>
<p>—瞎眼昏。</p>
<p>駡着，狠狠地。</p>
<p>—對不起。</p>
<p>—誰跟你開玩笑？</p>
<p>—十分對不起。</p>
<p>隨後帶着詼諧，折一個低到脯胸的腰身。</p>
<p>又幾個同伴出來說好說歹，有個順着把手蓋上的她的肩胛，露出一面粗野而邪狎的臉子，接着。她發惱地用勁推開那支强力的手。</p>
<p>火啦，憤憤地說道··</p>
<p>—猪玀，不干你們的鳥事，懂規矩一點。</p>
<p>望着把手蓋在肩胛的男子，她投了鄙蔑的一眼，唾了一口無形的嘴涎沫。那個燒破她的袍子的硬扯着她的袖子，要她一塊兒坐桌子，作算賠她的損失。她可一死兒坐着，　着嘴，連睬都不睬眯。</p>
<p>這麽着，於是有人咕噥着：</p>
<p>嘿，眞不識抬舉。</p>
<p>—搭什麽臭架了，碰着老子可不是這種話頭。</p>
<p>一些壞話是淸淸晰晰聽明白了的，無端無故把袍子毁了不算，還嘔着許多狗屁氣。够橫蠻，自家兒到底是個軟弱的身子，得讓人家隨便奚落，想着想着，又忿怒又傷心，眼眶沿邊不禁酸酸地溜起水來。</p>
<p>藍嘉寳哭了，在咽喉裏無聲的哭，低低的喘着氣，别人是不曾留心到的。</p>
<p>就留心到亦當做笑料拿來打哈哈，而咱們可淸晰地聽她在一重一輕的抽搐着。悲楚地。是呵！一雙温柔而美艶而又憂愁的小鴿子，裝飾得穿花的大夜蝶那麽妖媚。和和順順在許多陌生人的懷裏輪流做怯懦的小貓，爲了幾只角子，得把身體任人家抱着，踏着，幾隻角子換了一陣肉的顫振，已够悲哀啦！</p>

<h3>「大衆語」與有聲電影</h3>
<p>— 許幸之</p>
<p>最近「大衆語」的提出，將成爲一切藝術上的先决問題而等待着解决，可是，在電影圈裏的作家和批評家們，却在用着電影的「冷視眼」，靜觀着文藝界正在熱辯着的問題，彷彿無關心地輕輕地把這事件放過了。</p>
<p>七月六日大晚報的「火炬」上，以「大衆語問題批判」爲標題的霓璐君，最初提出了「以現代敎化大衆最有力的有聲電影和舞臺劇，將怎樣規定牠們的「對白」和「臺詞」底大衆語與有聲電影的問題。關於這問題，我們生活在電影園裏的朋友們還沒有什麽表見，這眞是遺憾萬千的事情。</p>
<p>原來，現代的有聲電影，牠不但俱備着文學上的「叙述法」，和戲劇上的表演法來表達故事的進展，同時，牠還要借重人們日常生活的「語言」，和「音響効果」等來完成牠的形象藝術的姿態。在電影裏單靠叙述和表演，現在已經不能滿足人們的願望，進一步，人們還要求着更切合於自己生活的「語言」與「音響」的力强的表現。換句話說，人們除了要求視覺的滿足之外，更要求着聽覺或嗅覺的滿足。（如最近蘇聯的「官能劇塲」正在試騐嗅覺戲劇的公演）。在語言，與銀幕不可分離的要求上，那麽，「大衆語」就不得不成爲目前有聲電影中的重要問題了。</p>
<p>電影作家和批評家們！我們對於正在發展着的中國有聲電影中「大衆語」的問題，似乎比在文學上應該格外熱烈而雄辯地討論，因爲電影旣經成了敎化大衆最有力的工具，同時，電影較之文學格外有着實騐的効果。譬如··在有聲電影中是否允許所謂「國語」的存續或揚棄？是否能條件地引用「方言」和「土語」的潛入？以及「大衆語」在銀幕上如何建立的問題，我想，這决不是與中國有聲電影發展的前途毫無關心的事件吧？這裏，我希望着電影作家和批評家們把這問題展開了狂熱地討論！同時，我更期待着「大衆語」能在銀幕上作實證的試騐和建立！</p>

<h3>評「田野風月」　Ａｓ　Ｔｈｅ　Ｅａｒｔｈ　Ｔｕｒｎｓ　—國泰—</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>和「小婦人」一樣，這「田野風月」也是以小說改編的，並且劇作者還極保存着文學的風味，卽是說，他將文藝的氣氛，幾乎是不打扣折的移植到電影上來。</p>
<p>關於小說的改編電影，最近在雜誌作品上，曾經有人提出反對，理由是電影自有其獨特的内容與形式而文藝的搬上銀幕，往往失了原著的眞髓，他以爲銀幕上的「堂吉訶德」比之小說是變質了的失敗，以此爲例，他反對文藝電影之製作。當然，這是很値得討論的。但是我們却得藉此機會提出一點簡單的意見，我們是不反對文藝電影之存在的？</p>
<p>我們懂得，對於一種文藝作品的改編，劇作者决不能將其不加選擇的移植過來。這不僅是容量的問題，而是電影應當有其獨特的戲劇的存在。很顯然的，文藝和電影是兩種不同的東西，但是電影的作者假使能將文藝變爲電影藝術的地表現出來。它未嘗不能將文藝更好的獲得原著之眞價的存在。</p>
<p>「唐吉訶德」的電影成功與否，不在本文的爭論之列，而小說的改編電影，確有不少是非常成功的，譬如默片的「復活」，就是最好的例證。</p>
<p>最近，我們又看過許多文藝電影，現在我們就這「田野風月」來略事檢討一下。關於本片的主題，以下論及，現在我們先得來看表現方法。首先我們該會有這種感覺，這裏沒有一般電影所具備的嚴密的故事，而是將小說中所充分包含的田家風味，幾乎是素描的，很詩意的表現出來。這種方法，我們似乎在「小婦人」中曾經領受過一次，那種小說的細膩的心理描寫，以及人物及周圍的空氣的有機的關聯，的確是小說氣氛的將我們從字裏行間所得着的想像，在銀幕上充分的描畫出來。我們覺得雖然是在看戲，然而依然保留着我們讀小說時所特有的吟味。　　的確，經過導演亞爾法德格林（Ａｌｆｅｒｄ　Ｅ　Ｇｒｅｅｎ）熟練的手法，他將田園風味及人物的動態，完全是詩的表現出來。輕淡的，靜穆的，歡悅的，同時也是哀怨的。從冬到春，從夏到冬，田園的景物和人物的心靈變化，使我們陶醉在大自然的美麗之中，同時也使我們發生對於鄕村的歌頌。在那些人物中，有的是在靜穆的空氣，感覺單純生活的單調，有的是在貧窮而勞苦的生活中感覺怨懟，有的在和平的生活中感覺愉快，雖然她的日常工作也很勞苦，再有的是小學生們，他們或她們天眞活潑的祇能感覺人與人之間純潔而眞摯的情感。因此我們可以這樣說，描寫人羣中複雜的人情，雖然也祇是三個家庭分别的描寫，但是他們之間的恩怨或同情，確是非常細膩的淋漓盡緻。</p>
<p>假使說得不十分錯的話，那末我們以爲這種樸素的取材，以至於輕淡的描寫，在已經存在着的電影藝術中，這應當是一種新的分派。也許如前面所述，這裏沒有像一般電影所通有的嚴密結構的故事，在商業的觀點上，大槪是不會怎樣成功的，因爲一般的觀衆，他們在旣成的習慣中要求着離奇曲折的故事，然而在電影藝術上說，無論如何，這是一種新的嘗試，何况這對於富於幻想的智識份子階層，乃是非常適合口味的。　　我們看罷，在創作技巧上說，這裏是沒有什麽地方可以輕便指斥的，無論各人個性的描寫，或是周圍空氣的烘托，以至於調子的節奏，都是很合乎電影藝術的。假使說多少還有一點不十分完美的話，那就是當斯坦家裏的失火，而斯坦自己却帶着鄰女在跳舞，等着他回家時望着一堆灰燼，並沒有顯出慌張的神色，相反的，祇是淡然置之　然而這些地方，在一般影片中，這每每是作爲戲的高潮的。然而也許導演要它輕淡到底吧。所以在大雷大風大雨之後的失火，也祗是作爲極平常的事件帶過。</p>
<p>無論是在音響效果，或是攝影的柔和，都和整個的調子統一着。尤其是對於演員的支配，因爲兄弟骨肉的關係，所以主要的演員在面貎上却很相似。差不多每一個演員身上，都可看出導演之指導的力量。女主角琪恩瑪爾（ＪｅａｎＭｕｉｒ）的成功，應當得着最高的榮譽。最明白是她的演技，毫不過火的適如其量，絲毫沒有火氣，所給與我們的是充分的眞實。其他演員都很稱職，而甚至於小演員們，如小情人臨别流涙的時候，也是非常逼眞的而可看出導演之深刻的描寫手法。</p>
<p>最後我們要說到的便是劇本的同容了。</p>
<p>關於這一方面，我們的意見是如此</p>
<p>和平的鄕村，在目前恐怕是不易多見，而主題的敎農人們安份守己的樂於貧賤樸質的生活，永遠守着自己的田園，充實表現出對於大自然的歌頌，這無論如何是和時代的進展中歸眞返璞的收尾，有着頗爲相似的地方，至少劇作者是沒有看見現實的殘酷鬥爭，而在現時代中，作着十八世紀的鄕村美麗的追懷。</p>
<p>然而，由於這内容所决定的表現技巧，其使我們陶醉在歌頌大自然的氛圍中，的確是値得十分注意的。所以我們承認，到底這是一部値得一看的作品。</p>
<h3>「柔腸烈性」Ｓｐｉｔｆｉｒｅ－大上海</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>繼「小婦人」而來的第五部凱撒玲赫潑本主演的「柔腸烈性」，在這裏她飾一個「野貓」的「山野」的女兒，縱然她的演出的成績並沒有怎樣的失敗，可是，一種受了劇本的制限的她的個性的壓抑是誰都能看得出來的。</p>
<p>在「小婦人」裏，以凱撒玲赫潑本來飾演「玉」，只是抓住了她的奔放的，帶一點神秘性的個性的一部分，而不是全部，然而，在「柔腸烈性」裏，我們看到的不但不是凱撒玲赫潑本的個性部分與劇中的菊莉甘的個性相適合，而是赫潑本的個性完全受到菊莉甘的個性的Ｒｅｓｔｒａｉｎｔ。這是可惜的，美國的製片者是這樣的不能把握住一個有天才的演員的個性。</p>
<p>就連「柔腸烈性」的故事本身而言，雖至如「小婦人」那般司是以鄕村女子爲題材，然而，從一個偶然的小孩身上發展出全部的劇情，而且，菊莉甘的愚笨的救護一個小孩的方法，是亦値得我們訕笑。</p>
<p>雖然導演Ｊｏｈｎ　Ｃｒｏｍ　Ｗｅｌｌ的手法並不怎樣低劣，但是明顯地也遭受到了劇本的制限。而那約翰與菊莉甘談愛的冗長的塲面不但不能爲全劇生色，反而使觀衆起滯呆之感。</p>
<p>除了村民的來和菊莉甘作難的一個Ｃｌｉｍａｘ之外，其餘都是一貫的平凡，所留的只是繁冗的對白，和一些宣傳宗敎的氣息。不是嗎？在「粗獷」的「愚陋」的村民來和她作難時，菊莉甘大聲的宣述着「耶穌說的，我要愛我的仇敵……」以至最後菊莉甘祈禱說··「復活和生存，只是上帝的意志，沒有誰能够殺死這性命……」來爲她自己解釋她並沒有殺死那個小孩。要觀衆來同情這個無辜的村女，就是要觀衆給予一個虔信上帝的被村民逼迫離去的村女以無限的同情和贊美。難道我們果眞要同情這一個虔信上帝的村女嗎？縱然劇作者在怎樣的要使我們同情，然而，我們的回答是否定的。</p>

<p>斐列普一個人正在自己屋子裏，如痴如夢的時候，他覺著密特麗的嘴唇在他的臉拂着吻着。他突然自己驚醒了，張開眼睛一看，站在他面前的，不是密特麗而是莎麗。莎麗看着斐列普，心中亦是覺得酸楚萬狀。她低聲地問道··一你覺得怎麽樣？」斐列普默然不答，祇頻頻搖着頭。莎麗冒險問道··「你還愛她嗎？」斐列普搖着頭道··「不。」他又深深歎了一口氣，斷續地說道··「就是……這樣，我的一生如此……就在她未死之前，在我身外……在我身内，她早已死了。」他視若無覩地對着莎麗。一回他又伸出手來，微顫着倒了一杯酒，喝下去了。莎麗故意尋着話問他道··「你在醫院什麽時候畢業呢？」斐列普又歎着氣道··「還有幾天就完了。」莎麗道··「以後怎樣呢？」斐列普的眼睛，看着幾本旅行指導的小册子。他早已决定了離開此地。最好能在船上做一個醫生！去到世界各處遊蕩着，一地厭倦了，再換一個新風景，新空氣。莎麗說道··「你爲什麽不和我一同回到我們鄕下去呢？爸爸特别的要呌你去哩。」斐列普就答應了她……他是無可無不可的……至少他在目前，是一些反抗的力量都沒有的。</p>

<h3>Yin Tong Arrives in Beijing to Report to Wang on North China Affairs; Will Travel to Mogan Mountain with Tang Youren to Meet Huang Fu Within Days</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, arrived at Pukou at 8:00 AM on the 11th via the Pingpu through train. He immediately transferred to the Chengping ferry to cross the river and went to the Bank of China on Baixia Road for a temporary stay. Yin only brought one servant and two suitcases, keeping his movements quite secret. After arriving in Beijing, he immediately visited President Wang to provide a detailed report and seek instructions on various North China issues. A reporter, avoiding the appearance of seeking an interview with Yin on the ferry, managed to have a fifteen-minute conversation with him. The situation and conversation are described below:</p>
<p>Yin's arrival was quite secretive. When departing from Beiping to Tianjin, the Railway Bureau provided a special chartered carriage. Upon arriving in Tianjin, he switched to a passenger car to avoid attracting attention. When disembarking at Pukou, only one attendant dressed in student attire carried his suitcases. Yin, who usually wears Western suits, this time wore a summer cloth long gown, a Panama hat, and white patent leather shoes, carrying a walking stick. He quietly entered the station amidst the crowd. None of the employees at the entire Tianjin-Pukou Railway station recognized him as Yin Tong, the central figure currently managing the North China issue. After boarding the Chengping ferry, Yin sat quietly in a corner of the first-class cabin, appearing calm. When a reporter called him "Director Yin," he replied, "Please don't mistake me; I'm from Jinan to Beijing." After the ferry cast off, the reporter approached and stated that he recognized the Director, hoping that he could answer some questions regarding the North China issue within reasonable limits. Yin forced a smile and answered each question adequately. Upon arriving at Xiaguan, a police officer from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway hired business car No. 1544 to quickly drive into the city. To avoid being followed by reporters, he repeatedly looked back at the reporters' car, but the two cars maintained a consistent distance. Yin then ordered the car to stop at the Bank of China at Daxiang Palace, feigning to get off and waving the car away for a detour. However, within five minutes, the same car returned to the front of the bank, still carrying Yin south. He then turned into the Bank of China on Baixia Road and rushed inside. There, Yin unloaded his luggage.</p>
<p>According to Yin's conversation with the reporter on the ferry, the Japanese side has not yet expressed any opinions regarding the abolition of the Tanggu Truce, and China has not yet formally requested its abolition. However, there is a possibility of making such a request recently. As for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the war zone, negotiations are currently underway, and the result will definitely be a withdrawal, without question. When the reporter asked whether the recent visit to Beijing by Japanese envoy Arima said that the North China issue was entirely handled by Director Yin, following the instructions of Chairman Huang and negotiating with the Japanese Kwantung Army, Yin scratched his head and smiled, saying that it was not necessarily so. It was not convenient to disclose details at this time and he hoped that the people would not mention this matter too much. As for the incident of the train bombing at Chadian since the Beining Railway was opened to traffic, he had already resigned out of guilt. When the reporter asked whether he had withdrawn his resignation after being persuaded to stay by the Ministry of Railways, Yin said he had not withdrawn it yet. He was not sure whether he would visit President Wang or Minister Gu on this trip to Beijing. However, when the reporter told him that Minister Gu had gone to Shanghai and had not returned, Yin paid great attention. As for the police affairs of the Beining Railway in the future, various rumors seem to be speculation. The Japanese troops escorting the trains after the opening to traffic have already been withdrawn. Our police affairs will not be changed due to the Chadian train bombing, and the Japanese side has never mentioned this police issue. Therefore, there is no major issue with the police affairs of the Beining Railway. When asked by the reporter, Yin insisted that he was just coming for fun, but between breaths, he also said that he was not here to discuss matters related to the opening to traffic. When the reporter asked whether he was here to discuss the entire North China issue, Yin did not give a firm denial and even nodded slightly. This future development is worth our attention. Yin also said that although he had heard of Chairman Huang's return to Beiping, he did not know the exact date. He would probably leave after the entire North China issue had been resolved. The date could only be known after meeting Chairman Huang. As for whether he would go to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang before leaving, it had not yet been decided. He did not intend to stay in Beijing for long this time and would go to Shanghai or Hangzhou. Yin kept the location of the meeting with Chairman Huang a secret, answering vaguely that it was uncertain whether it would be in Shanghai or Hangzhou. Yin indicated that he would stay in the South for about a week before returning to the North. According to reporter inquiries, Yin will return to the North with Huang Fu to deal with the future internal and external affairs of North China. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After staying at the Bank of China for a short while, Yin Tong took a car to Xiaguan and stayed at the Yangtze Hotel. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, Tang Youren, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, drove to visit him. They discussed issues such as the withdrawal of troops from the North China war zone and the removal of Japanese troops from the Beining Railway for a long time.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the Ping-Shen through train has suffered repeated accidents, passengers are wary. They also feel that the strict inspections by both sides at Yuguan are inconvenient, so many passengers have switched to other trains. They transfer at Yuguan. Only eighteen passengers from outside the pass arrived in Beiping on the second train this morning. Of those departing from Beiping on the same train, only a little more than thirty people purchased tickets for the section outside the pass. Business is extremely slow. According to someone from a certain organization in Yuguan who came to Beiping, there are as many as nine inspection agencies at Yuguan for the Ping-Shen through train, including the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency, the Military Police, the Garrison Army, the puppet police, the puppet customs, the Datong Company, our side's Qindao Customs branch, the railway police, and the local police. Passengers feel very inconvenient. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang sent Tang Youren to Mogan Mountain to urge Huang Fu to go north. Tang is scheduled to depart from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway on the morning of the 12th. Yin Tong will also travel to Hangzhou to report on the situation of the Ping-Shen through train. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong arrived here this morning from Tianjin. He plans to go to Mogan Mountain to meet Huang Fu. According to Yin, this trip is entirely of a private nature. He has not yet withdrawn his resignation. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong's trip south from Tianjin has two tasks: 1. To report to the Ministry of Railways on the Chadian train bombing incident. 2. To represent the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee to urge Huang Fu to return north. Yin will pass through Beijing without staying and go directly to Shanghai, then to Hangzhou, and then to Mogan Mountain to visit Huang. He will enter Beijing with Huang. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Plans to Use the Through Train to Smuggle Salt into the Country</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to financial circles, after the loss of the four northeastern provinces, Japan developed the Liaoning salt industry, greatly increasing production. Transportation technology has also greatly improved. Since the signing of the Tanggu Truce, Japanese ruffians outside the pass have colluded with traitors to smuggle large quantities of salt into the country through customs. They sell it in various counties in eastern Hebei, greatly affecting the Changlu salt tax. Now that the Ping-Shen through train has been implemented, it is heard that the Japanese side will further request through transportation of goods in order to allow sea salt from outside the pass to be directly transported to various parts of the country for dumping. If this matter is realized, not only will the Changlu salt tax be greatly affected, but our country's salt administration will also suffer a serious blow. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Hurricane Discovered in South China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a report from the Central Meteorological Observatory, a hurricane was discovered in southern China at 6:00 AM on the 11th, located at 120 degrees east longitude and 18 degrees north latitude at the center. It is moving north-northeast at a slow speed over the ocean east of Luzon Island, with a tendency to dissipate. According to the current situation, the Chinese coast is not expected to be affected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Central Political Council Supplements Impeachment Measures; Restricts Public Disclosure of Content of Control Yuan Impeachment Cases; Central Political Council Has the Right to Review Disciplinary Decisions; Important Documents Must Be Disclosed After Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council held its 416th meeting on the morning of the 11th, attended by Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, and more than twenty others. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, and the following important cases were resolved:</p>
<p>1. A proposal by the Standing Committee regarding impeachment cases is to be supplemented with the following measures: (1) The original text of the Control Yuan impeachment case, the impeached person's statement of defense, and all relevant information and news related to the case may not be disclosed until the agency handling the case has decided to make it public. (2) For political officials appointed by the Central Political Conference, if the Central Political Conference deems it necessary after the disciplinary agency has decided on a punishment, it may review it. (3) Important documents concerning national policy and China's international status may not be disclosed without the approval of the Central Political Conference.</p>
<p>2. The regulations drafted by the Examination Yuan for convening a national examination and personnel evaluation conference are approved for record.</p>
<p>3. Ten budget estimates are approved. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office for Establishment of Customs at Five Passes of the Great Wall to Be Established in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Gao Yuanji, Supervisor of the Yantai Customs of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Department, was transferred to Beiping to organize a preparatory office for the establishment of customs at the five passes of the Great Wall. Gao passed through Tianjin by train this morning and went to Beiping. The customs officials at each pass will be transferred from the Tianjin Customs, Qinhuangdao Customs, and Yantai Customs, with a maximum of six people at each pass. The Qinhuangdao Customs will be reorganized after the 20th to also handle land customs affairs. If the personnel at the customs are insufficient, outstanding students from the Beiping Tax Vocational School established by the Tax Department will be selected for training. In the past two months, because the Tianjin Customs inspections have been very strict, Japanese goods cannot evade taxes. They are smuggled in through Yuguan and various passes of the Great Wall, first arriving in Beiping and then being transported to Tianjin for distribution. More than ten million can be imported each month. Therefore, the Japanese side strongly disagrees with our establishment of customs at the passes and is trying to find ways to prevent its implementation. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of establishing customs at the various passes of the Great Wall, our financial authorities believe that it is of great importance to our country's tax revenue. In addition to establishing 27 branch checkpoints in the East China and Jiaozhou Sea Customs districts to collect import taxes on goods from the Northeast, five branch checkpoints have also been established in the Tianjin Sea and Qinhuangdao Sea Customs districts, which are closer to the Great Wall. Taxes have already been levied on goods passing through the various passes of the Great Wall. According to a certain important official in financial circles, after the establishment of tax checkpoints at the various passes of the Great Wall, the Japanese side actually recognized that our country had established the Great Wall line as the customs line. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance of the puppet state also clearly ordered that the Great Wall line be the southern border customs line of Manchukuo and also established customs bureaus in Yuguan and other western passes starting on the first of this month. Therefore, goods passing through the various passes of the Great Wall have encountered great obstacles due to double taxation. Because our side has never levied any kind of tax on foreign goods imported from various parts of the Northeast that enter through the Great Wall, now goods passing through the various passes of the Great Wall must not only pay taxes to the puppet regime but also pay import taxes or transit taxes levied by our side. For example, rice and grain imported from western Liaoning to the North China war zone are now smuggled into Tianjin by sea through Qinhuangdao due to this relationship. This is indeed a major problem for customs revenue. Our financial authorities will send personnel to investigate separately to find solutions. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Uses Excuses to Delay War Zone Issues; Huang Orders Yin and Tao to Negotiate at Any Time</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Various unresolved issues in the war zone are still being negotiated with the Japanese side, but because the highest authorities of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee are not in Beiping, the Japanese side is using excuses to delay. The major issues that were waiting to be negotiated a month ago include: 1. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the seven passes along the Great Wall and various places such as Saheqiao, Jianchangying, and Taitouying. 2. Matters concerning the establishment of customs branch checkpoints at various passes. 3. The entry of the Xinbao Security Team and the carrying of weapons, and the compilation and training of the three units of Han Zexin, Zhao Lei, and Liu Zuozhou in Yutian and eastern Hebei. 4. Measures to ban illegal activities by Japanese and Korean ruffians in the war zone and to investigate and prohibit the trafficking of drugs. 5. The issue of abolishing the Tanggu Truce. After the Ping-Shen through train was opened to traffic, our central authorities had expressed their intention to abolish the Tanggu Truce, hoping to comprehensively resolve the unresolved issues in the war zone in the short term. They have repeatedly urged Huang to go north. Recently, the central government sent a telegram urging Huang to go to Beijing first to discuss everything before coming north. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu telegraphed Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others regarding various issues in the war zone, ordering them to negotiate with the Japanese side locally at any time. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tixin has temporarily postponed his return to Malan Village because all the roads have been washed away. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of puppet police from the Great Wall line, after the puppet police were withdrawn from Nantianmen to Gubeikou, the puppet police captain, Hong Lu Qilang, still led more than twenty puppet police to stay in the town and carry out their duties as usual. Puppet police are also stationed at Yuguan and Xifengkou. Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng once negotiated with Chaisan on this issue. The Japanese side indicated that they would wait for the Tianjin conference to resolve it. As for the measures to ban Japanese and Korean ruffians, it was decided that the Japanese consulate in Tianjin or the local Japanese agency would issue certificates. Those without certificates may be banned by our government agencies. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is still taking a delaying attitude towards the entry of the Xinbao Security Team into the war zone and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Great Wall line. Negotiations have not made any progress. Recently, both sides planned to hold a meeting in Tianjin to discuss the plan first and resolve it after Huang Fu goes north. The meeting is scheduled to take place before the reception of the Eastern Mausoleums, because the Japanese side is very concerned about the number of security teams entering the Eastern Mausoleums and other issues. It is necessary to discuss it beforehand. Tao Shangming is resting at home due to heatstroke. Yin Rugeng also took his family to the Western Hills yesterday due to the hot weather and returned to Beiping today. Yin denied that the war zone negotiations had stalled.

<h3>Contents of Exchange Documents Between El Salvador and Puppet Manchukuo; No Formal Letter of Recognition Signed by the President; League of Nations Will Submit to the September General Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today published the exchange of letters between the so-called "Manchukuo" and the foreign ministers of El Salvador regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. However, its contents do not include a formal document signed by the President of El Salvador recognizing the puppet state. Therefore, the Secretariat of the League of Nations has not been able to determine whether El Salvador has indeed recognized "Manchukuo" because the exchange of documents does not have a definitive formal action. A total of five documents were published today, the most important of which is the reply from Salvadoran Foreign Minister Aranju on April 26 to "Manchukuo," which stated, "We have received your letter of March 1, the first year of Kangde (1934), stating that Your Excellency Puyi has ascended the throne as the Emperor of 'Manchukuo' on this day, and we sincerely hope that the friendship between the two countries will become increasingly harmonious and seek mutual benefit, etc. Our government is sympathetic to this and hopes that the friendship between the two sides will be eternal," etc. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After El Salvador recognized "Manchukuo," the League of Nations inquired with El Salvador about the details. On the 5th of this month, El Salvador sent a copy of the correspondence between that country and "Manchukuo" to the League of Nations. The Secretariat of the League of Nations has today made this document public. According to the information, on May 9 of this year, after the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, heard the news that El Salvador had recognized "Manchukuo," he immediately wrote to the Salvadoran Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aro Yue, requesting that "all information regarding this matter that is deemed relevant by the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues of the Council of the League of Nations and the member states of the League of Nations be notified to the League of Nations." He stated that this was only an inquiry from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to a member state and had no other meaning. The Salvadoran Foreign Minister, Aro Yue, immediately replied in writing on June 2, reporting the information requested by the Secretary-General to the League of Nations. With the consent of the Salvadoran Foreign Minister, Aro Yue, Secretary-General Avenol published today the documents exchanged between the Salvadoran Foreign Minister and the "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister since March 1, 1934.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Movement to Promote Domestic Goods Needs to Be Expanded</h3>
<p>In recent years, our country's industries have shown a state of extreme decline. Other things aside, the cotton weaving industry alone is enough to startle us. According to the latest statistics from the annual report of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, Shanghai is the center of national yarn sales. Using 1930 as a base year (100), the current sales index of Shanghai's recent four years of market sales by merchant guilds is as follows: In 1931, it was only 78% of 1930; in 1932, it was only 52%; and in 1933, it was only 35%. Such a gradual decline in yarn sales naturally reflects the contraction of the purchasing power of the hinterland society. At the same time, it also reflects the extremely serious crisis of overproduction that the Shanghai cotton weaving industry has faced in recent times. Therefore, the report of the Yarn Mill Association also said, "The total rate of production reduction in the country is still close to 23%. However, in terms of domestic yarn sales, even with this rate of reduction, production is still suffering from overproduction. The trend of increasing yarn inventory has not been curbed." What has happened to the cotton weaving industry is not that different from the experiences of other industries. Therefore, judging from the general situation, there is no denying that our country's industries are in urgent need of rescue.</p>
<p>Now that the national industry has fallen to such a point, what is the most important method of rescue to promote? We believe it should still be the "National Goods Movement" that is currently popular throughout the country and led by the financial community. Speaking of the success or failure of the National Goods Movement, the following points are particularly worthy of our attention: (1) In the current stage of the National Goods Movement, although it is called for the full cooperation of production, transportation, and sales, transportation and sales still occupy the main position, with the regret of a deformed development. (2) In the past, the financial community's assistance to the National Goods Movement cannot be said to be inadequate, but it has not been able to improve production technology. (3) The National Goods Movement aims to stimulate national consumption of domestic industrial products. At the same time, it is also a method to promote the expansion of domestic industrial capital, but it is not the only method. According to the current situation, can it be enough to solve the current difficult position of the national industrial community? The answer is, of course, no. If we hope that the National Goods Movement can "go one step further," then we must admit that its content still needs to be enriched and expanded.</p>
<p>How should the content of the National Goods Movement be enriched and expanded? Based on the current actual needs, we believe that the basic conditions for that should not be limited to the progress of transportation and sales, and the cooperation of the financial community in transportation and sales. Instead, it must be the reduction of production costs, at least lighter than the costs of foreign merchants or foreign-owned factories in China. Otherwise, the so-called National Goods Movement will not only fail to achieve any results, but it will also make it difficult to maintain a healthy relationship between the financial community and the industrial community. The method of reducing production costs can be carried out in two ways. The first is the improvement of production technology. The so-called improvement of production technology aims to reduce the "labor" cost per unit of product. However, given the current state of industrial fatigue, the improvement of production technology involves a large investment of capital, which is naturally difficult to achieve. However, it must still be regarded as the main way to promote the National Goods Movement. The second is the adjustment of tariffs. If the government can properly use tariffs and inland taxes (such as consolidated taxes) in conjunction, it can not only reduce the dumping of foreign goods and adjust the prices of raw materials, but also directly cause a drop in costs. For example, foreign-owned factories and Chinese-owned factories operating in the cotton weaving industry have always had no difference in the burden of consolidated taxes. If the consolidated tax tariff can be changed and a tax refund method is implemented, it will be equivalent to directly reducing the burden on Chinese-owned factories. Another example is the tariff item. If the import of piece goods can be heavily taxed and the import tax on raw cotton can be reduced, it will be enough to maintain the competitive sales power of Chinese-owned factories and reduce their costs. In short, changes in tariffs are not a permanent solution, but sometimes they are very effective in protecting the domestic market and reducing the cost of domestic products.</p>
<p>The victory of the National Goods Movement is based on reducing costs as a basic condition, and reducing costs must start from improving production technology and adjusting tax rates. All the directions that the government and the industrial community should strive for lie here. If you only know how to advocate the National Goods Movement but cannot do it according to actual needs, what results can be seen?</p>
<h3>The Establishment of Understanding between Britain and France Is the Key to European Peace; Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact Plan; Britain Agrees to Take a Benevolent Neutrality</h3>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou has now left the UK. According to reliable sources obtained by the Associated Press, the talks between Britain and France this time can be regarded as the most important move for European peace since the war. It is said that the discussions in the external and naval departments for two days have resulted in two important results. First, the United Kingdom has decided to take a benevolent neutral attitude towards the mutual assistance plan between France and Russia, linking seven Eastern European countries, including Germany. Second, France has indicated that if Germany joins this Eastern European Pact, France can make great concessions in terms of armaments, allowing Germany to rearm to a considerable extent. This concession by France is particularly welcomed by political and diplomatic circles here, who believe that it can give the long-awaited disarmament conference a new life. German Navy Chief Petri is still here, staying for a few days to continue discussing next year's naval conference plan with British Navy Secretary Monsell. (National Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A person connected to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his opinion today, pointing out that the mission of French Foreign Minister Barthou to London has achieved excellent results. It is heard that Barthou's talks with British Foreign Secretary Simon have obtained British acquiescence to an Eastern Locarno Pact and have increased trust in Anglo-French relations, and have made Anglo-French support for Russia's accession to the League of Nations more powerful. (Reuters Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>France's Exchange Conditions with Britain for Concessions on Disarmament Issues</h3>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers are extremely satisfied with the results of Foreign Minister Barthou's London talks. The main point of the London talks seems to be that Britain agrees to the Eastern Locarno Pact proposed by France, in exchange for France complying with Britain on the disarmament issue and abandoning its past uncoordinated attitude.</p>
<h3>England Decides to Stay Out of the Fray, Hoping to Facilitate a Mutual Assistance Pact</h3>
<p>According to Parisian newspapers, England will strive to ensure the wording of a mutual assistance pact is acceptable to both Italy and Germany, while remaining outside the agreement itself. It is expected that Soviet Russia will also participate. However, one newspaper claims that Britain is deeply convinced that Germany will refuse to join, while the Soviet Russian government believes that if Germany can join a mutual assistance pact within the scope of the League of Nations covenant, it is also prepared to participate. In other words, Soviet Russia will request to join the League of Nations as a preliminary step. England does not object to Soviet Russia's accession, provided that Soviet Russia accepts all the responsibilities arising from joining the League of Nations. French newspapers reiterate that England should consider France's proposal in good faith because France guarantees it does not want Soviet Russia to join the Locarno Pact, and England will not assume any further obligations beyond the Locarno Treaty, and that the new mutual assistance pact is indeed based on reciprocity. According to various newspapers, the Anglo-French alliance is non-existent, and a universal pact encompassing all existing regional agreements has been shelved. The so-called ordinary Locarno Pact has no connection with the Eastern Locarno Pact. Another report states that Baldwin explicitly told Barthou that England, under no circumstances, wishes to join any agreement with Soviet Russia. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Success or Failure of the Pact Hinges on the Attitude of Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>(London) The regional mutual assistance pact policy advocated by France has been endorsed by England. Foreign Minister Barthou's meeting with British authorities was initially intended as merely an exchange of information, but unexpectedly resulted in such significant international ramifications. England is not only in favor of the Eastern Locarno Treaty, but is also willing to advocate for this plan to various governments to help it succeed. The governments in question include Warsaw and Berlin. As for Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations, England's non-opposition has become a certainty. Since Barthou explained the nature and purpose of the regional mutual assistance pact, British political circles have sincerely endorsed this plan. However, there are still considerable difficulties in its implementation. The British authorities believe that the guarantees given to each signatory country in the pact should be absolutely reciprocal. Barthou has, of course, provided the necessary explanations to reassure England on this point. What remains uncertain is how Berlin and Rome will accept the pact that is about to be concluded in Europe. To what extent the recent political changes in Germany will alter German foreign policy, we cannot know at present. However, general observers believe that since the "old German" elements have gained the upper hand in Germany, dealings with Berlin may become more convenient in the near future. There is some truth to this. It should be noted that the victory of the German right wing may, in the coming months, lead to a gradual easing of Germany's foreign relations, but this may not be the case in the long run, because the diplomatic policy of the old German elements is more agile and resolute than that of the Third Reich authorities. However, we can temporarily set aside the precise outcome of the regional mutual assistance treaty. In general, this plan has been fully endorsed by England. We can only wait and see the results of France's negotiations with other countries. If England's assistance is needed during the negotiations, and there is hope of success, England will be happy to lend a hand, as mentioned above. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Continental Mutual Assistance Plan: The Backbone of a Comprehensive Agreement; French Foreign Minister Explains in Detail to England</h3>
<p>(London) The London Times, Morning Post, and Daily Telegraph all carried the same news today, stating that the entire time of the Anglo-French conference today was spent by French Foreign Minister Barthou explaining his agreement plan. In addition to his well-known regional agreements and the Nordic mutual assistance agreement, Barthou also proposed a continental mutual assistance plan. This plan is the cornerstone of the entire agreement, and will be signed simultaneously by other signatory countries. This is also the so-called general agreement, whose function is like the backbone of the entire agreement system, and the League of Nations covenant and the Locarno Treaty are all within its plan. However, while explaining the plan, Barthou explicitly stated that when England participates in this plan, its responsibilities will not exceed the obligations it has already assumed in the Locarno Treaty. However, the Times believes that Barthou's statements do not induce England to change its long-standing anti-inclination stance. (Tenth National Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>England Makes No New Promises; Inertia and Passivity Give Preferential Treatment; It is Ultimately Difficult to Discern the Hints from the Anglo-French Communiqué</h3>
<p>(London) The wording of the Anglo-French communiqué is still very cryptic, making it difficult to discern its hints, and inquiries in British official circles have also failed to yield any details. Although French Foreign Minister Barthou found his time in England to be pleasant, England's attitude towards France's wishes can be summed up by the short phrase "inertia and passive preferential treatment" published in the Parisian Daily. England has made no new promises, but has clearly stated its intention to strictly fulfill its existing promises. France wants to strive to maintain peace in Europe, especially focusing on the Eastern Locarno, in other words, the proposal of the Litvinov Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact. France wants England to publicly express its understanding of France's efforts. Germany can also join this pact, but Germany is unwilling to accept it immediately. According to the French, if their country expresses goodwill towards this pact, and Germany still does not join, then Germany's isolated position will become more apparent. England's attitude is that France can proceed as it wishes, as long as the Eastern Locarno Pact does not conflict with the Western Locarno Pact, and England will never interfere with the affairs of others if it expands the responsibilities of the signatories of the Western Locarno.

<h3>Barthou's Triumphant Speech on French Diplomacy; Unexpected Gains</h3>
<p>(London) Barthou expressed his joy upon leaving London, believing that England and France share the same views on the general situation in Europe, and that he has returned with England's neutral guarantee for France's efforts to create a new system of security agreements on the European continent.

<h3>At the Invitation of the Italian Prime Minister, Barthou Will Visit Rome</h3>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Barthou departed for France at 4:30 this afternoon. Before leaving, he told people that he had reached an agreement with British Foreign Secretary Simon on European issues, and that he was very satisfied with this trip. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was rumored here last night from well-informed sources that French Foreign Minister Barthou, having just returned to France from London, may travel to Rome in the near future. According to reports, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had previously invited Barthou to Italy, and now it is learned that Barthou intends to respond to the Italian Prime Minister upon his return from the British capital, accepting his invitation. However, the date of Barthou's departure has not yet been determined, as there are several Franco-Italian issues, especially colonial issues, that must be resolved before Barthou prepares to depart.

<h3>Germany Formally Asks England for Naval Equality; Any Proposals Will Be Rejected Without Achieving This Goal; France, England, and the United States Begin Preliminary Naval Talks; Both Political and Technical Aspects Are Involved; German and Russian Participation Is Problematic</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, Germany's demand for naval equality has been formally presented to the British Foreign Office by the German Ambassador to London. The German Ambassador expressed readiness to agree to the maximum limits of shipbuilding, but said that if Germany does not obtain equal naval power, it will be difficult to consider any proposals. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Naval experts from England and France met this morning to discuss the technical aspects of the naval negotiations. French Naval Minister Pietri is scheduled to meet again with Davis, the chief representative of the United States, this afternoon to discuss the matter. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It is now learned that British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, French Naval Minister Pietri, and Davis, the US representative to the disarmament conference, will hold a meeting here tomorrow to discuss naval issues. The question of whether Germany and Russia will participate in the 1935 naval conference will likely be discussed during the meeting. The French authorities have now indicated that France does not object to Germany's participation, but feel that if Germany and Russia have the right to speak at next year's conference, and Germany demands naval equality in the Baltic Sea, then Russia will also have the same demand. (Tenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The talks between England and France on naval issues are only just beginning. French Naval Minister Pietri, at the request of the British government, extended his stay by forty-eight hours and rescheduled his return to France to Thursday. After Foreign Minister Barthou departs, Pietri will hold talks with British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, with the participation of not only the French entourage, but also personnel from the British Admiralty and Mr. Craigie, the head of the Asian Affairs Department of the Foreign Office. The discussions will cover the political and technical issues related to the 1935 naval conference. The so-called political issue is actually the most crucial procedural issue, in other words, whether the conference should be limited to the signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty, or whether other countries should be invited to participate together. This refers to the preliminary talks or the formal 1935 naval conference. England believes that it is in favor of Germany and Russia participating in the preliminary talks, but is hesitant about their participation in the formal naval conference. Moreover, if Germany participates in the naval conference, it may raise the issue of arms equality, which, once raised, would be difficult to answer. Therefore, although this issue seems to be merely procedural on the surface, it raises all sorts of difficulties. Because of this, Barthou was unable to discuss it during his short stay in England and had to leave it to Pietri to resolve. As for the technical issues, we already know that the British shipbuilding policy differs from that of the United States and Italy. England focuses on light ships, while the United States and Italy advocate large ships. England and France have only touched on this point briefly, but both sides believe that there will be no insurmountable difficulties in this matter. US Disarmament Representative Davis will meet with French Naval Minister Pietri in the near future, and Pietri will inform Davis of the opinions exchanged between England and France. Davis met with Barthou this afternoon. However, the scope of Barthou's discussions with the British authorities was broad, and the time for Barthou's meeting with the US representative was short. Barthou could only briefly touch on naval issues and spend the rest of the time explaining the regional mutual assistance pact to Davis in detail. This was inevitable. According to the US delegation, the preliminary naval talks must wait until the Japanese representative arrives in London on July 20 before entering an important stage. As for the Italian shipbuilding plan, it affects US policy on the one hand, because the Italian 35,000-ton battleship provides a legitimate reason for the US to advocate for a large-ship policy, and it affects British policy on the other hand, because British naval policy must shift with the US. As for French naval policy, it is only of interest to the extent that the country is affected by Italian policy. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>A Frightening Death Ray; Possessing Immense Destructive Power, Capable of Destroying World Civilization</h3>
<p>(New York) The American inventor Tesla, who invented cosmic light, announced today that his new invention is capable of preventing war. Today is Tesla's 78th birthday, and as the house was filled with well-wishers, the great scientist declared that he is currently researching a death ray that can annihilate entire armies. Even the newest battleships will be unable to unleash their power when faced with this ray, and even the most powerful squadrons of aircraft will fall. The research on the death ray will take several more years to complete, but past inventions have already made this ray the most destructive tool in the world. Tesla declared that, in order to ensure that his invention benefits humanity rather than destroys it, he will present the method of his invention to all the countries of the world, so that they understand that a new war will destroy civilization. This is the best guarantee of peace. Tesla has also made many contributions to modern radio. His invention of the alternating current rotary field principle and arc light, etc., are all praised by the world. (Tenth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese New Minister of Communications Develops Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada seems to have specifically entrusted Minister of Communications Tokonami to enhance the civil aviation industry. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications plans to further enhance the expansion plan from the era of Minister Minami, in order to realize the long-standing issue. Therefore, the aviation budget for next year will inevitably increase. Domestic Taiwan flights are scheduled to begin on October 1 of next year, with three round trips per week. Air routes will also be opened between Tokyo, Sendai, Aomori, and Sapporo, scheduled to operate daily from January of the eleventh year of Showa. In addition, the Japan-Manchuria connecting flight across the Sea of Japan will complete its facilities in Toyama or Matsue. Regularly scheduled flights from Japan to Manchuria are also planned to build two airfields and implement them as soon as possible. In addition, a plan has been established to open an international air route from Taiwan via Manila in the Philippines to Singapore. As soon as Minister Tokonami decides, flights can be operated successively, marking an epoch-making development in the Japanese aviation world. (Eleventh Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Expands Air Force</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) From the perspective of defending the Imperial Capital and operating in the Pacific, the Japanese Navy plans to establish air groups in Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture, and from the perspective of defending the Sea of Japan, it plans to establish one in Maizuru. Concrete preparations have been completed, and construction will begin within days. In order to make these defenses complete, it is also planned to establish air groups in Chinhae, Korea, Nemuro, Hokkaido, and on the east coast of Kagoshima. The Army pays close attention to the defense of the Imperial Capital, feeling that the current Eastern Tokyo Garrison Command is insufficient, and advocates setting up the Kanto Air Defense Command, with the Kanto area as its jurisdiction. In peacetime, the air defense troops will be attached to this agency to prepare for any eventuality, so that there will be no regrets. This is a very powerful argument. If the budget is passed, it will be implemented from next year. (Eleventh Denstu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Invent New Weapons of War</h3>

<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister's Trip to Paris Aimed at Negotiating Loans; Seeking to Realize a Major National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Bucharest Romanian Prime Minister Titulescu and Finance Minister Slavitzescu left here today for France, intending to spend several days in Paris before returning home directly. Their original plan to visit London and the capitals of the Little Entente countries at the same time has been canceled. The main purpose of their trip is to negotiate a large loan from France to prepare for the implementation of Romania's new major national defense plan. This plan was discussed with French Foreign Minister Barthou when he was in Bucharest. At that time, Romania intended to mortgage the petroleum produced domestically. It is likely that negotiations will continue on the previous proposal this time. If this proposal succeeds, the Romanian government can directly sell the oil it produces without going through other procedures, because the oil wells in Romania are under the direct jurisdiction of the government, and the annual oil tax is paid with oil production. It is also heard that the debt that France agrees to lend will not be paid in cash, but will be supplied to Romanian military factories with materials of the same value. (Tenth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Austrian Cabinet Reorganized; Dollfuss Holds Five Key Positions Concurrently; Centralizing Military Power to Purge Reactionaries</h3>
<p>Vienna The Information Bureau announced that the Dollfuss cabinet submitted its resignation to President Miklas last night, which was approved. Dollfuss was ordered to organize a new cabinet, the list of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Federal Government Prime Minister, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of National Security, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of National Defense: Dollfuss.

<p>Vienna The motive for the Austrian cabinet reorganization is due to recent clashes between the fascist Heimwehr and the national army, but it is not believed that the reorganization occurred so quickly. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna According to responsible sources, this cabinet reorganization will not cause any changes to the foreign policy of the Dollfuss government, because the Dollfuss government continues to exist as before. However, the newspapers published at noon and in the evening all believe that the concentration of military power in Dollfuss's hands is extremely important, and that the final duel against terrorism is now underway. The newspapers also believe that the process of clarifying domestic affairs will be greatly accelerated after this cabinet reorganization, and that attacks against the country's enemies have now begun. In short, this cabinet reorganization is a personal victory for Dollfuss from both domestic and foreign policy perspectives, and it also proves the closer cooperation between Dollfuss and Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg.

<h3>German Propaganda Minister Attacks Foreign Press in Broadcast, Accusing Them of Maliciously Provoking Recent German Events</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio address today, attacking foreign newspapers. The speech was broadcast nationwide. Goebbels, in the name of the German people, protested against the inaccurate reporting by foreign newspapers, particularly British and French journalists, regarding Hitler's purge that began on June 30th. He accused most international newspapers, with a few exceptions, of malicious provocation and arbitrary slander. Goebbels then compared the frivolousness of foreign newspapers with the prudence of German newspapers. He stated that the German government could not tolerate foreign reporters residing in Germany who incite hatred against the German people and make sincere, unbiased international relations impossible. The German government has openly and without concealment announced to the world what Germany experienced on June 30th, believing that the nation and the world, if fully informed of the background of the events and the danger of rebellion, would be relieved. Goebbels concluded by praising Hitler for his resolute and decisive measures in eliminating disruptive and ruthless elements within the party. He claimed this action saved Germany and the world from a great calamity. He also said that all the German people now trust Hitler, which is commendable. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The prominent British newspaper, the Daily Mail, has been indefinitely banned from distribution in Germany by the authorities. This is because the paper published an article discussing the "clarification" of the German Sturmabteilung (SA), angering the German authorities. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Adds Ministry of Internal Affairs, Orders Abolition of Secret Police, Reforms Judiciary to Embrace Democratic System; 50,000 Secret Agents Transferred to Red Army</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The government today formally announced the reorganization of the secret police. From now on, the iron grip of this organization will no longer cause pain to millions of Russians. Russia is currently undergoing a major reorganization of the entire judicial system to align it with the existing systems of Western democratic countries. The reorganization of the secret police is also part of this effort. In the future, it will be merged into the newly established Ministry of Internal Affairs. The most important aspect of this announcement is that the secret police will no longer have the power to judge. Therefore, the Soviet government will no longer be able to freely impose death penalties, long-term imprisonment, or exile on the Russian people. In the future, all political prisoners will have to be tried publicly and cannot be secretly executed by secret agents. The former deputy head of the secret police, Yagoda, has been appointed as the new commissioner of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Countless prisoners who have been imprisoned in Soviet prisons will be released, including many well-known political prisoners. Stalin believes that Russia's economic situation has improved, and a bumper harvest is expected this year. Foreign relations have also greatly improved, so the internal political situation can be relaxed somewhat. A large number of personnel in the secret police have already been dismissed and reassigned as rural leaders. The remaining personnel will be reassigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to perform intelligence work. As for the original 50,000 secret police personnel, they will be reorganized into the Red Army by the Military Committee. The newly established Ministry of Internal Affairs can impose a sentence of three years imprisonment or exile for certain crimes. However, other crimes must be tried by the courts. The reorganization of the secret police was decided several months ago, but it was only implemented now due to the difficulty in organizing the Ministry of Internal Affairs. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Central Committee of the Soviet Union issued an order to establish a new Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, merging the State Political Directorate into the commission. The commission's responsibilities are to ensure revolutionary order and national security, protect public (socialist) property, defend borders, and handle registration matters such as births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. The commission is divided into departments for national security, civil militia, border and internal guards, fire fighting, correctional labor camps and labor settlement zones, and others. All federal republics, except the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), will establish their own internal affairs commissions. The RSFSR will only have a representative office of the All-Union Ministry of Internal Affairs. The judicial bureau of the original State Political Directorate will also be abolished. The People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and his local agencies will have all criminal cases investigated by them tried by the courts with jurisdiction according to law. Cases involving intelligence administration and national security will be submitted to the Supreme Court for trial. Cases involving conspiracy and espionage will be submitted to the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court for trial according to the nature of the crime. A special committee under the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs will be responsible for the removal of administrative personnel, exile, the execution of sentences of correctional labor camps for periods not exceeding five years, and deportation. Genrikh Yagoda has been appointed as the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union, with Yagranov as his first assistant and Prolinfiev as his second assistant. Detailed rules regarding the procedures for the commission's review of criminal cases have been separately published to supplement the order. (TASS, 10th)</p>

<h3>New Salt Law Difficult to Implement Immediately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Salt Affairs Administration, the implementation of the new salt law will be delayed because the detailed implementation rules have not yet been formulated. The selection of production sites, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management of sales are all difficult to decide. Currently, the government is strictly implementing economic controls, and the new salt law is difficult to control. As for tax revenue, it has increased sharply in recent years, with annual revenue exceeding 15 million yuan. If the new salt law is implemented, the government will only focus on manufacturing and storage. If the government does not adopt a system of official sales, then it will be equivalent to ordinary goods that anyone can purchase. Outsiders suspect that the salt affairs authorities are not working hard to implement the new law, but this is a misunderstanding. In June, Zhejiang, under the guise of a production conference, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that Yongjia County and its surrounding areas be selected to pilot the new salt law. The Ministry of Finance and the Salt Affairs Administration have not yet responded. In fact, when the new salt law is implemented, a separate committee will be established. If it is implemented only partially, it is unlikely to be successful. It is heard that the salt affairs authorities consider the implementation of the new salt law to be a problem, but they believe that the impact on people's livelihood should be considered in terms of tax revenue. Even if the new salt law is not implemented, it is still necessary to find ways to reduce tax rates. The Hankou Chamber of Commerce has requested the Executive Yuan to reduce the salt tax rate and set a deadline for implementing the new salt law, levying a tax of 5 yuan per 100 kilograms, with no additional charges.

<h3>Xiang River Dike in Hubei Province Breaches, Seven Hundred Li Become a Waterland, Severe Drought in Southern and Eastern Hubei</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the flood in Hubei Province in 1931, the government authorities and local people learned a painful lesson and actively engaged in dike repair and flood prevention work. Both sides of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers have considerable protection. This year, Tongcheng in southern Hubei suffered two floods due to flash floods, which receded in a few days. Although the losses were significant, they did not affect the overall situation. As the flood season approached, the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers did not rise, and the people were celebrating peace and tranquility. Unexpectedly, in late June, heavy rains persisted in counties such as Xiangfan and Yun in northern Hubei, and the rainfall in southern Shaanxi was also high. The rainwater concentrated, and the Xiang River rose sharply, exceeding the highest water level in 1931. As a result, the situation suddenly became serious. In addition to Qianjiang County, which bore the brunt and suffered dike breaches, the riverbanks of Mianyang, Hanchuan, and Hanyang along the river were also extremely dangerous due to water erosion. The dikes at Xiantao Town, Yuwang Palace, Maiwangzui, Fenshuizui, Sanchatan, Bakeyi, Banghukou, Chenghuanggang, Yangchikou, Tujiata, Ximakou, Jiangxi Wan, Mabuyi, Zhishantang, Hanchuan City, Suoziyi, Baihezhou, X溝鎮, Gaohu Dike, Yongshu Wan, etc., were submerged by water a week ago. The Fifth Works Division of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau dispatched personnel to cooperate with the Hanchuan County Government to supervise the rescue efforts. Hanchuan City, Jiangxi Wan, Suoziyi, Baihezhou, and Bakeyi were fortunate to avoid danger, but other dikes could not be supported due to the lack of flood control materials and insufficient funding. The Gaohu Dike at Ximakou completely collapsed on the evening of the 5th of this month, affecting Xiangben Wan, Hejia Wan, and Xu Mi Wan, destroying many shops in Ximakou Street and drowning more than 20 men and women. Subsequently, the Yongshu Wan trunk dike successively overflowed and collapsed. The folk dikes of Huangong, Renhe, Fafu, Xiangxing, Tiancheng, Yongfeng, Taihe, and Baishi were affected and collapsed accordingly. The houses and crops within the dikes were all submerged, and many people and livestock were injured. More than 700 li in length and breadth have become a waterland. Therefore, the exact amount of the loss is difficult to investigate at once. In recent days, the water has tended to stabilize slightly, probably due to excessive dike breaches and diversion in all directions. Otherwise, it is not known to what extent it would have risen. On the Yangtze River, counties such as Jianli in the upper reaches have already suffered disasters. The water level in Hankou continues to rise. The old Daokou leaks at Qingshan in Wuchang have been plugged with earth, and the dangerous works at Sanyidian and Wutai Gate will soon be completed. The gate of Saihu Dike leading to Tongxiang Gate has also been properly arranged. There are no dangerous signs on the dikes along the Yangtze River in Hankou. However, cracks were found on the Jinyintan dike surface of the Zhanggong Dike, and workers are being ordered to fill it with earth and drive high piles widely on the dike foundation, piling up boulders for suppression. If the water does not rise again, it may be safe. The Provincial Relief Association believes that the floods in Qianjiang, Mianyang, Hanchuan, Zhongxiang, Jianli, and Junyun counties in northern Hubei have become a reality, and the refugees are waiting for relief urgently. However, the relief funds in the association have long been exhausted and cannot be allocated. It was decided to hold a plenary committee meeting at the Provincial Government on the 11th to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time as this severe flood, a drought has also occurred. Counties such as Puchi, Xianning, Chongyang, and Yangxin in southern Hubei, and Huangmei, Guangji, Huanggang, and Luotian in eastern Hubei have not had rain for a long time, and the crops have withered. Compared with the flood-stricken areas, the suffering is the same. The Department of Civil Affairs has sent a letter to the Hankou Municipal Government and issued a notice to all counties to ban slaughter for seven days to appeal to heaven for harmony. The severity of the disaster can be seen. (10th)</p>
<h3>More Than 2,000 Wild Dogs Executed in Jinan, All Wild Dogs in the City Thoroughly Eliminated, People of Hebei Request to Stop Releasing Dogs</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: There have always been many stray dogs in this city, which have been allowed to reproduce without restraint. They are rampant everywhere, not only barking and snarling, which is annoying to hear, but also mad dogs have been found from time to time, which has a major impact on the safety of citizens. Since last year, the municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau to begin cracking down. Citizens who keep domestic dogs must obtain copper tags. A dog-catching team was dispatched to arrest and adopt stray dogs without owners. After gathering a certain number of them, they were transported to Luokou and released to the north bank of the Yellow River. In the past six months, the number has been very large. Now, the people on the north bank of the Yellow River have submitted a petition to the provincial government, stating that there are too many stray dogs, including rabid dogs, which endanger public safety. They requested that the release of dogs be stopped. Moreover, dogs can swim. In the Wangjiadaokou area near Luokou, some have swum from the north bank back to the south bank, which is still harmful. The municipal government, in view of this situation, has stopped transporting dogs to Hebei. However, the accumulated number is increasing day by day. There are now more than 2,000 dogs in the dog prison near the Hongzi Factory. Since they cannot be transported out, they still need to be fed every day, which is not a good policy. It is now requesting the approval of Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu to execute the more than 2,000 stray dogs under Qianfoshan tomorrow (the 11th). (10th)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, and Others Go to Lushan to Visit Jiang Jieshi to Discuss Bandit Suppression Plans and Meet with He Jian</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, the Garrison Commander of Hubei, had previously gone to northern Hubei to be stationed in Fancheng and set up an office there, because the Sichuan bandits were attempting to flee to the border areas of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei. This was on the orders of a telegram from Chairman Jiang Jieshi. He completed the military deployment for preventing bandits and returned to Hankou by plane a few days ago. Now that Chairman Jiang Jieshi has arrived in Lushan from Nanjing and will convene a meeting of generals in Lushan to instruct on bandit suppression strategies, he, along with Xu Yuanquan, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hubei-Hunan border area, and Xiao Zhichu, the Commander of the 26th Army, took the Ningshao merchant ship eastward to Lushan at 9:00 PM on the 10th. They will not stay long in Jiujiang and will return to Hankou within a few days, still going to Fancheng to be stationed. Xu's mission is to report on the aftermath of bandit suppression in western Hubei and submit a plan for border area roads and a local construction plan to Jiang Jieshi for approval and implementation. Xiao will ask for instructions on taking over the defense of northern Hubei and will return with He. (10th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: All Sectors Are Planning Drought Relief Work</h3>
<p>The city river in this county was previously dredged, costing a lot of money and poor workmanship, which was criticized by landlords, who repeatedly attacked it. The project was then suspended. Recently, due to the hot weather and prolonged drought, the river water has dried up, and the crops have withered and are waiting to die. The drought has become a disaster, and the price of rice has risen repeatedly. Farmers are extremely alarmed, and the city is also trying to remedy the situation for fire prevention and drinking water. The County Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the provincial government to appeal for the people, requesting that the river dredging be continued as soon as possible, and also telegraphed to fellow villagers in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places for assistance. The Chamber of Commerce has now received a reply from fellow villagers traveling in Nanjing, stating briefly that they have received the letter and have sent telegrams to the provincial government and County Magistrate Jin Wen, saying: (abridged above) The dredging of the Songjiang city river is indeed necessary. The reason for the attacks is the poor contracting system and the poor construction methods. The river dredging authorities should listen to the opinions of local people. Now that the river water has dried up and the entire city is panicked, please quickly instruct County Magistrate Jin to convene local impartial gentry to publicly discuss dredging methods and start construction by a certain date to maintain water conservancy and save the people. Zhu Shuyuan, Shen Liren, Guang Qi, Pang Songzhou, Zhang Shuxun, Xie Mingxun, Song Shoupeng, Cheng Tingxu, etc. of the Beijing Yun 간 Association, respectfully implore. The content of the letter to County Magistrate Jin is similar, so it is omitted. Local people such as Xu Shousheng and others believe that the scorching sun is rampant and they are eagerly hoping for rain. Since there has been no rain for a long time, they should sincerely pray. They have gathered their colleagues to invite Taoist priests to set up a prayer altar, starting from the 14th for a period of three days. The county government...</p>
<p>Shops in front of the door discussed fire prevention methods at the Dong Yong'an Fire Brigade yesterday. They all agreed that the river water was dry, and fire prevention was worrying. They were willing to donate funds from businesses from Zishoumin Bridge to Guangming Bridge to hire workers to dredge the shallow areas, hoping to accumulate some water to prevent unexpected events. It is heard that the county government believes that the autumn dredging of the river is not far away, and partial dredging will hinder the overall plan and will not be approved. Li Zufua, the head of the first district, is also afraid of a spark that can start a prairie fire. The weather is hot and dry, and the river water is like slurry. Therefore, he instructed the town chiefs to widely borrow large jars and place them in various important places. When the tide comes, the cleaners will be instructed to fill them with water for emergencies. The drought relief work in various sectors is quite tense.</p>
<h3>Water Police Captain Rescues Abductee</h3>
<p>Fan Guozhong, the captain of the 3rd Water Police Team, personally led his subordinates and detectives from the County Public Security Bureau on the evening of the 7th to rescue a kidnap victim, Zhang Pinlan, near Yinglong Temple. They were immediately escorted to the Minhang District Department. Fan and his subordinates continued to search in the area, trying to capture all the bandits in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Six Houses Robbed in Xiangcheng Township</h3>
<p>Thirteen bandits armed with weapons robbed three houses in Da Wu Village, Xiangcheng Township yesterday (11th) at 5:00 AM, robbing Chen Nianzai, Zhou Guoxiang, and Zhang Zhennian one after another. Then, they went to Yangjiao Village and robbed Wu Qianbo, Gong Weibo, and Wu Shusong one after another, losing about 1,000 taels of gold. The thieves fled towards Yangcheng Lake.</p>
<h3>Xiangming Villagers Surround the District Office</h3>
<p>Wu Qiyun, the magistrate of Wu County, is very concerned about the drought in Wu County. He specifically raised the matter for discussion at the political affairs meeting yesterday (11th). It was decided to form a drought prevention committee to be responsible for handling the matter. In addition to representatives from various agencies, local people were invited to serve as members of the committee. The first meeting is scheduled to be held today (12th) morning. Yesterday (11th) morning, five to six hundred villagers from Hengjing Township, Suzhou, flocked to the Hengjing Township District Office to petition. There were two purposes for their petition: (1) to request the dispatch of personnel to survey the disaster; (2) to request the District Office to pray for rain. At the time, the villagers surrounded the District Office. The district head then consulted the county government by long-distance telephone. County Magistrate Wu also replied by telephone that the authorities were planning remedial measures for the first point. If there is no way to recover, personnel will be sent to investigate. For the second point, the people can pray for rain themselves, and the authorities are not convenient to participate. At noon, the villagers dispersed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Su, Chang, and Zhen Counties Take Note of the East Dam Issue</h3>
<p>The East Dam is located fifty *li* west of Liyang County and southeast of Gaochun County. It is the hydraulic artery connecting the north and south banks of Jiangsu Province with Guangde County in Anhui Province. Built in the twenty-fifth year of the Ming Hongwu era, it uses steel as reinforcement, greenstone as the bone, and is mixed with *sanhe* soil. The dam body is extremely strong. Above the dam is Guangtong Town, a very prosperous market. In the twenty-ninth year of the Qing Daoguang era, there was a major flood north of the Yangtze River. Farmers in Gaochun once stole and opened the dam, causing the prefectures of Su, Song, Chang, and Zhen to become completely submerged. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, both north and south of the Yangtze River suffered floods. The people of Gaochun County once gathered thousands of people and forcibly tried to open the dam. The counties downstream reported this to the provincial government, which dispatched security teams to forcibly stop them. This year, there was a major flood north of the Yangtze River and a severe drought south of the Yangtze River. The people of Huai, Yi, Si, and Shu counties once proposed opening the East Dam to divert the water from the upper reaches of the canal north of the Yangtze River to relieve the drought south of the Yangtze River. However, Chu Nanqiang of Yixing immediately telegraphed the provincial government requesting the opening of the East Dam. The villages of Wujin also believed that the drought was already a foregone conclusion and there was no way to save it. They all advocated opening the East Dam as soon as possible. The county government invited various public organizations to hold a meeting on the ninth and tenth of the month for strict discussion. Everyone believed that opening the East Dam would indeed increase the water level of the rivers in the southern counties, but whether it could save the farmland was still uncertain. If there was a water shortage, the flood would be unstoppable, and the three *Wu* regions would become a valley, and the counties of Su, Chang, and Zhen would become a watery expanse. Everyone advocated careful consideration. The final decision was to use alum stone and Portland cement to make a gate after the dam was opened, and to regulate the opening and closing of the gate according to the water and drought conditions north and south of the Yangtze River, so as to ensure that the water level north and south of the Yangtze River was balanced. County Magistrate Cai Pei submitted this plan to the Construction Department of the provincial government yesterday (the eleventh), seeking concrete measures. He will then invite representatives from the relevant counties of Su, Zhen, Chang, and Song to discuss and decide together. At the same time, County Magistrate Cai also telegraphed Yan, the County Magistrate of Wuxi, inviting him to go to the provincial government together to make a unified request. Public organizations in Wuxi, upon receiving this news, believed that this matter was of great importance and telegraphed the counties of Su, Chang, Yi, and Yu to solicit their opinions. They learned that Shi Yunqing, the chairman of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce, believed that Wujiang was the lowest-lying area, and if the East Dam were opened, Wujiang would become a watery expanse. They telegraphed the chambers of commerce of Wujiang, Qingpu, and Kunshan to solicit their opinions, and telegraphed the Wujin Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to carefully consider. Qian Sunqing, the executive director of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, happened to be in the provincial capital on business and visited the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce and the leaders of the Civil Affairs Department and Construction Department of the provincial government. Everyone believed that the East Dam was the hydraulic artery connecting the upper and lower reaches of the canal north and south of the Yangtze River, and the water level was twenty-seven or eight *chi* higher. Once opened, it would not only have a significant impact on the water conservancy of Jiangsu Province, but also on Anhui Province. Therefore, everyone advocated careful consideration.</p>
<h3>Wuxi and Jin County Resolve to Relieve the Famine</h3>
<p>The counties of Su and Chang have been without rain for a long time, and the disaster is already apparent. Famine relief meetings have been convened one after another. The details are as follows: (A) The Wujin County government convened a famine relief meeting on the tenth, attended by the heads of each district and representatives of various public organizations. It was resolved that the county government would borrow 100,000 yuan from various banks, the use of which is as follows: (1) Purchase water-lifting machines as much as possible to pump water from rivers and lakes into the internal rivers, and then let farmers irrigate their fields. (2) Purchase a large amount of diesel to supply farmers to irrigate their fields. (3) Only 20% of the seedlings have been planted. The rest are difficult to plant, and the seedlings are withered and cannot be replanted. In the future, buckwheat can only be replanted, and the seeds will be distributed by the county government. (B) The Wuxi county government also convened a meeting of the heads of each district and representatives of various groups yesterday (the eleventh), and resolved (1) to open the Lüjiang Estuary as soon as possible, (2) to restrict rice prices, (3) to request the Farmers Bank to lend money for water lifting, (4) to organize the grain stored in each district, (5) to request the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau to improve the construction of railway bridges, and (6) to reorganize the old ferries in each village to make up for the lack of water-lifting machines.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Severe Drought Without Rain, Tensions Rise Over Disaster Prevention</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in Wuyi, the weather has been severely dry, the fields and crops have withered, and the disaster is already apparent. Farmers are frowning all day long, longing for rain clouds. Although the slaughter ban has been implemented to pray for rain, the heavens have not only shown no sign of rain, but the temperature has continued to rise to over 102 degrees. County Magistrate Cai Pei specially convened a preparatory meeting of the Disaster Prevention Committee on the ninth, and continued to hold the first committee meeting on the tenth. Important matters were decided: to contact the eight counties downstream of the Yangtze River, including Yixing, Liyang, Wuxi, Wu County, Wujiang, Changshu, and Jiangyin, and request the provincial government to open the East Dam in order to increase the water level and use it to lift water to save the fields and crops. In addition to telegraphing each county to advocate unanimously, County Magistrate Cai also personally went to Zhen today (the eleventh) with a petition to request the provincial government and the Civil Construction Department to decide to open the dam. In addition, it was also decided to borrow 100,000 yuan from banks and money shops, using provincial taxes as collateral, as disaster prevention funds. The estimated distribution of uses is: 40 water-lifting machines will cost about 60,000 yuan, 200 tons of diesel will cost about 20,000 yuan, and miscellaneous grain seeds will cost about 20,000 yuan. The borrowing method is to submit a request to the provincial department for approval on the one hand, and to allocate loans to various banks and money shops on the other hand.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Red Pill Factory Smashed</h3>
<p>Huang Laosi, a guest from Jiulong Town, Qidong, made red pills and sold them in Haimen and Qidong counties, making a lot of profit. A secret report was made to the county government the other day. County Magistrate Li instructed Xie, the director of the Public Security Section, to supervise Song Guopei, the patrol officer of the first branch, and many patrolmen to search. Raw materials for red pills and pill-making machines were seized and taken to the county for investigation. However, the red pill criminal Huang Laosi escaped and has not been caught. The county government has ordered a strict search.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Two Robberies in a Row in Baojiatang</h3>
<p>At midnight on the ninth, the home of Bao Yunyuan, the principal of Jiwang Central Elementary School in Baojiatang, east of Huangdu Station, was robbed by a dozen bandits armed with pistols and other weapons. They fired a shot to intimidate and prohibit any outcry, broke into the house, and carried out a robbery. Later, they went to Bao Zhiren's house to rob, losing clothing, jewelry, cash, etc., estimated at about 1,000 yuan. On the night of the fourth, the home of Cai Axiao, a tailor in Caijiazhai, Guangxiang, northwest of Guangfu, was robbed by six bandits armed with pistols who came from Shanghai, losing more than 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Guanyun Judge Bribed and Released Traitors</h3>
<p>Sun Lüsan, a judge in Guanyun County, was bribed 3,000 yuan and released traitors from the county. Chairman Chen of the provincial government learned of this, telegraphed the county magistrate of the county, ordering him to escort Sun Lüsan to the province. He has been escorted to the province, and Chairman Chen ordered the department to interrogate him and then ordered him to be escorted to the Zhenjiang Court for handling. It is learned that after Sun Lüsan was escorted to the court, the procuratorate began its investigation. In addition to thoroughly investigating the bribery and release of traitors, it also received a telegraph from the county, accusing Sun of violating the law and neglecting his duties while in office. Prosecutor Li Qiu summoned Xu Jiakui, Lin Cizhao, Xu Shuzhen, Zhang Ruitang, Ji Wenbin, and Sun's wife, Wang, who were relevant to Sun's case, to the first investigation court at 10:00 a.m. on the tenth to investigate according to law.

<h3>Provincial Order to Urge Deed Tax Collection in All Counties</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government found that the land deed tax had been resolved by the provincial government committee.</p>
<p>From May 1st, the original tax rate of selling nine and pledging six will be reduced to selling six and pledging three. The original surcharges and intermediary donations collected by each county will also be reduced proportionally. The limit is three months, and after the limit expires, taxes will still be collected at the rate of selling nine and pledging six. The Finance Department and the provincial government have repeatedly telegraphed orders to select cadres to urge the tax collection in various ways. Recently, according to the Finance Department's report, since the tax reduction in May, there have been many cases where the amount collected has exceeded the quota, but there are also many cases where the situation remains the same as before. Such disregard for the tax policy is very inappropriate. The tax reduction period is now less than a month away. It is specially ordered that the county magistrates comply with the order and quickly send personnel to the villages to carry out inspections and urging, so as to ensure that all untaxed deeds are taxed during the tax reduction period without any omission. The inspection and urging situation should be reported on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Fighting Over Water Rights Causes Injuries</h3>
<p>Jiang Tingbao, a farmer at the Ji'an Hotel in Beixiang, recently used a water pump to draw water for irrigation because of the hot weather and the need for water in the melon fields.

Jiang Tingbao and his brothers Tinglong and Tingkun were seriously injured in the head and waist. Their family members took them to the procuratorate of the court and requested an examination and the arrest of the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Various Agencies Meet to Discuss Drought Relief</h3>

Farmers' reports of the disaster are pouring in like snowflakes. Party and government agencies are meeting to discuss and properly arrange relief measures, starting on the tenth: (1) Purchase water-lifting machines and lend them to cooperatives in various places for application. (2) The county government will send Yang Yanzhu and Dou Hua to the villages to investigate the drought. (3) Ban slaughter for seven days to emphasize hygiene. (4) All police officers of the Public Security Bureau will go out to dredge the dirt and weeds from the rivers. (5) The four city gates of the town will be closed with gates, and water will be lifted into the city day and night to maintain the drinking water supply for residents. (6) Open an epidemic prevention hospital. (7) Strictly prohibit merchants from raising rice prices and hoarding rice. The county, district, and various township farmers will distribute as much rice as possible. (8) Stop collecting rent and taxes.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Epidemic Hospital Administers Vaccinations</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Hangzhou Epidemic Hospital has been crowded with patients and has been busy with diagnosis and treatment. Most of the patients suffer from heatstroke and gastroenteritis. In order to thoroughly prevent the epidemic, the hospital has specially prepared cholera vaccines from a famous German factory for group and citizen injections. They are administered day and night without any charge. If any group or factory has a large number of people, they can call the hospital and send a doctor to administer the injections. Citizens who suffer from seasonal illnesses can be sent to the hospital for treatment, and the cost of medicine, food, and accommodation will not be charged.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Soar, Affecting People's Food. Rice Merchants in the City Meet to Discuss Measures: Advise Merchants Not to Hoard or Raise Prices, Send Personnel to Rice-Producing Areas to Negotiate the Transportation of Rice to Shanghai, and Petition Government Agencies to Raise Funds for Grain Storage to Prevent Famine</h3>
<p>For a month, the weather has been extremely dry and the heat has been oppressive. Inland river ports have dried up, making transportation difficult, which has led to soaring rice prices and affected people's food. The government and the banking industry are planning to store grain to prevent famine. Rice merchants in the city also held a meeting yesterday to discuss measures to suppress rice prices and regulate people's food. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Meeting to Suppress Rice Prices: The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members of the North-South Rice Firms at Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss measures to suppress rice prices. More than 60 people attended, including Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Zisheng, Yan Xiaoquan, and Fu Shangen, as well as representatives from the North-South Rice Firms. After Chairman Gu Xinyi reported the reasons for convening the emergency meeting, the discussion began: (1) Advise merchants not to hoard or raise prices. (2) Rice firms will directly send personnel to rice-producing areas to negotiate the transportation of rice to Shanghai to regulate people's food. (3) Petition government agencies to quickly raise funds for grain storage to prevent famine.</p>
<p>The Cause and Effect of Soaring Prices: According to Zhu Zixiang, a standing committee member of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, to a reporter from Da Gong She yesterday,</p>
<p>"During the rainy season, farmers are engaged in transplanting rice seedlings, relying on rainwater to regulate moisture. Unexpectedly, the weather has been extremely dry in recent months, causing the tide in the inland towns and villages' riverbanks and small ports to dry up. Due to the drought, farmers are busy lifting water. Although they have stored rice, they want to sell it, but the river water is dry and cannot be transported to the cities. Therefore, the source of rice in Shanghai is decreasing day by day. However, Shanghai is not a rice-producing area. All the accumulated goods have long been sold out due to the hot weather, which could affect the storage. The inventory of japonica rice is inherently weak. Shanghai has a dense population, and the daily demand is huge. Seeing that the drought is about to become a disaster, people are preparing rice for famine prevention. Those who usually need one *shi* of rice are now buying one more *shi*. Considering the city's daily consumption of 12,000 to 13,000 *shi*, it has increased by one-third (approximately 4,000 *shi*). As such, the source is scarce and the supply cannot meet the demand. How can rice prices not rise? Regarding the rice stored in Shanghai, although japonica rice is lacking, the indica rice stored in various firms still has 300,000 *shi*, which is enough for one month. Moreover, the earliest produced Dongxin japonica rice can be seen in half a month. Therefore, there is no fear of rice shortage at all in terms of rice supply and demand."</p>
<p>Government and Banks Store Grain to Prevent Famine: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the soaring rice prices in the city that are affecting people's food, has</p>
<p>drafted relief measures and submitted them to the municipal government for implementation of grain storage and famine prevention. The reporter from Da Gong She asked Zhou Minggang, the director of the Food Division of the Fourth Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday. He said that the plan for grain storage and famine prevention has been submitted to the municipal government for review and approval and will be implemented as soon as it is approved. In addition to the Executive Yuan ordering the Ministry of Finance to order the Central Bank to allocate a 500,000 fund to implement grain storage and famine prevention, the Farmers Banks in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are also raising funds to provide relief to farmers in various places.</p>
<p>Farmers Association Asks Again to Stop Price Increase: The Municipal Farmers Association submitted another request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, asking to stop the continued rise in rice prices. The original text</p>
<p>reads, "Regarding the step-by-step rise in rice prices, we ask again for restrictions to ensure people's livelihood. Since the soaring rice prices, this association has stated the evils of the shortage of grain and the fear of famine in a detailed manner, and has submitted them to your bureau, requesting restrictions on rice prices to maintain farmers' livelihoods and benefit people's food. However, more than ten days have passed, and rice prices have risen higher and higher, rising to a huge 12 yuan. In the past, although rice prices were high, the difference between the old *hu* and the market *hu* was very large. If calculated proportionally, each *shi* has exceeded 15 yuan or more. Middle-class society has already felt overwhelmed, let alone others. According to historical records, rice and firewood are too expensive to buy, which is the source of chaos. If measures are not taken to restrict merchants from hoarding and monopolizing, the people's livelihood will be unimaginable. Moreover, the weather is extremely dry, the rainfall is not adjusted, and the disaster is apparent. If rice prices rise step by step, farmers will have no survivors. Therefore, we dare to submit again to your bureau, please quickly restrict the price to no more than 10 yuan per right, and we urge you to prepare for opening warehouses to level out prices in case of emergency, with a urgent request for review and implementation. Sincerely presented to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>
<h3>Sweltering Heat for Seventeen Days: The Temperature Rose Sharply Again Yesterday, Only Second to the First Day, But It Felt Even More Unbearable</h3>
<p>Since June 25th, the city has been sweltering for seventeen consecutive days until yesterday. According to the astronomical observatory's daily announcements, the highest temperature was 102.7 degrees on July 1st, which was the highest record. Yesterday, it rose again to 102.4 degrees. The temperature should be lower than the first day, but under the heat wave, people inside feel that the tables and chairs are hot. Even those who sit still feel that the sweat is dripping and cannot be contained. Those who are rushing around on the road feel that their shirts and pants are soaked with sweat. It is because the heat is steaming and there is no place that is not hot, so it feels more unbearable than the first day.</p>
<p>The Hurricane Does Not Come: According to the Central News Agency, according to the astronomical observatory, the hurricane that arose in the South Pacific at 2:00 p.m. on the seventh has been advancing towards the west-northwest for days, and it seems to have a trend of attacking Shanghai. As of 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the hurricane has changed direction and retreated towards the north-northeast. It has retreated to 126 degrees east longitude and 18 degrees north latitude. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the hurricane will not attack Shanghai.</p>
<p>Five People Died from the Heat: According to Guo Wen She, the weather turned hot yesterday, and because the strong wind at sea did not come ashore yesterday, it felt even more stuffy. If one is not careful about health, one will easily get sick, and some even die. According to hospital statistics yesterday, five people died. The situation of each hospital is recorded as follows: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's South Clinic on Linyin Road has a special ambulance in front of the door to meet the needs of emergency rescue. Yesterday, a total of more than 300 patients were treated. (2) The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road treated 260 outpatients and 90 inpatients as of 7:30 p.m. yesterday. Four people died before they could be treated. (3) The Emergency Epidemic Hospital at the intersection of Xizang Road and Kaifeng Road treated 86 outpatients (as of 7:35 p.m.) and 7 inpatients yesterday. One person died before they could be treated. (4) The Red Cross Epidemic Hospital on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, treated 340 outpatients and 50 inpatients as of 7:50 p.m. yesterday. More than 60 people were vaccinated. In addition, two people have died since the opening on the seventh due to heatstroke emergencies that were not treated. (5) The Jiyi Association Epidemic Hospital on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, treated 452 outpatients and 50 inpatients as of 8:30 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Pious Prayers for Rain from All Quarters: No Rain for More Than Forty Days, May Sweet Rain Fall Soon, Everyone United</h3>
<p>Catholic Great Prayer: Since the beginning of summer, rainfall has been scarce, and the weather has been hot and dry. The rural fields and crops are all withered. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there has been no rain for more than forty days. Bishop Hui of the Catholic Shanghai District, in view of this, issued a notice to all priests under his command last week, leading the members of each congregation to hold prayers for rain, and respectfully reciting the prayer for rain. Lu Bohong, the president of the China National Catholic Action General Assembly, also, together with the members, invited priests at Xin Puyu Hall in Nanshi every day from July 9th to respectfully observe the Nine-Day Devotion, pray for rain, and ask for great blessings for rain, begging the Lord to have great compassion and send down sweet rain as soon as possible to save my life.</p>
<p>Two Places in Zhabei Pray for Rain: In Zhabei, in addition to the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, which has respectfully invited Dharma Master Lianfeng to recite scriptures sincerely for rain every night from 8:00 p.m., the Zhabei Charity Group also initiated prayers for sweet rain from last night through Mr. Wang Binyan, and respectfully erected the "Ten Continents, Three Islands, Five Lakes, Four Seas Dragon King" shrine in the charity hall, and disciples of the soul altar personally prayed for the omen of sweet rain.</p>
<p>Caohejing Prays for Rain: Due to the long-term lack of rain, withered green seedlings, and no hope for the autumn harvest, as well as the prevalence of epidemics and the suffering of chickens and dogs, Chen Yinru and other merchants and residents of Caohejing Town in West Shanghai, for the happiness of the people, have specially launched a three-day prayer meeting for rain starting today, and advised the public to observe vegetarianism and fasting, in order to touch the heavens and be able to descend sweet rain and universally save all living beings. All the arrangements have now been completed.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Went to Beijing Yesterday: To Meet Premier Wang Today and Report</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun, the envoy to France, asked for leave to return to China. After returning to China and arriving in Shanghai on the seventh of this month, he rested for a while. At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, he went to Beijing on the Shanghai-Ping train from the North Station with Shi Zhaokui, the secretary of the French embassy. He is scheduled to meet Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan today to report on the international situation and the current situation in Europe. After staying in Beijing for a short time, he plans to go to Jiangxi immediately to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues a Circular to Maintain National Products: No Additional Taxes or Levies Are Allowed Other Than Regular Taxes</h3>
<p>In order to maintain national products, the Ministry of Finance issued a special circular to the financial bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating that no taxes or levies may be arbitrarily added to domestic goods other than regular taxes. The order has arrived in Shanghai, and the original text is excerpted as follows: "The Ministry has convened a National Finance Conference. The ministry has suggested that in recent years, various industries have stated their difficulties and requested relief. Taking taxes and levies as an example, the raw materials purchased by various manufacturers and the goods produced, after paying taxes in accordance with regulations, are transported from Place A to Place B. Sometimes, they often have to collect illegal miscellaneous taxes similar to *lijin*, as well as various surcharges with various contrived names. The tax burden is heavy and the cost is high, resulting in sluggish sales and unsustainable business. It should be requested that domestic raw materials and goods be maintained," etc. After the conference resolved, "It should be strictly prohibited to arbitrarily increase taxes and levies in various places other than regular taxes to reduce the burden on industry and commerce," etc. In addition to separate orders, the compliance with the order and the reporting of the handling situation are required for future reference.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Order the Adoption of Domestic Materials</h3>
<p>The Two Railway Bureaus instructed the General Affairs and Materials Departments, "The various materials required by this railway on a regular basis are mostly produced in our country. We should adopt them as much as possible to help promote the domestic industry. It is now planned to collect samples of goods from domestic merchants for the types of materials used by this railway, and to examine them in detail. If they are indeed suitable, we will compare them with similar foreign goods in terms of efficiency and price. For example, (A) has a unit price of 15 yuan and can be used for three years, and (B) has a unit price of 10 yuan and can be used for two years. The annual value of both A and B is 5 yuan. Assuming that (A) is a foreign product and (B) is a domestic product, comparing the two, although the effectiveness of (B) is lower than (A), when the effectiveness is divided by the price, the two are equal. From now on, we should purchase domestic goods as much as possible according to this standard, and declare to domestic merchants that all materials must be qualified by the Bureau's inspection before a transaction can be concluded. This matter is related to the production and sales of domestic goods and saving resources, which is extremely important. The relevant department is ordered to strictly comply with the order and submit detailed measures for approval."</p>
<h3>He Bingxian Denies Being Transferred to the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industries</h3>
<p>A Beijing telegram stated that He Bingxian, the Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industries, would be transferred to the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industries. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency inquired He Bingxian about this. According to him, "The telegram said that Mei Zhe, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industries, would be assigned as the President of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and the vacancy would be filled by me. I have not heard of this so far, and I think it is a misrepresentation."</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce Appeal for the Amendment of the New Import Tariff</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks All Industries to Study: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the government's revised import tariff has an impact on the interests of all industries. In addition to giving a general description and telegraphing the Yuan and Ministry to request remedial measures, the Chamber of Commerce sent a special letter to the cotton fabric industry, the machinery dyeing and weaving industry, the silk factory industry, the silk printing industry, the woolen factory industry, and other trade associations, as well as the Chinese Paper Mill United Association and the Chinese Cotton Mill United Association, etc., instructing them to make concrete statements within the scope of their business, so as to compile cases for research and handling.</p>
<p>The National Products Production and Sales Association Submits a Document: Since the Ministry of Finance announced and implemented the new import tariff, the industrial and commercial circles in the city have expressed their opposition and unanimously demanded amendments in order to seek survival. Yesterday, the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association also submitted a special document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industries, requesting prompt correction in order to maintain the industry.</p>
<h3>The Dispute over the Strike at Zhabei Dayang Bridge Intensifies; Shops in Nearby Lidi Port Join the Strike, Demanding Punishment of the Culprits and Appealing to Yu Qiaqing to Uphold Justice – Authorities' Persuasion Proves Ineffective, City Federation and Others Offer Assistance –</h3>
<p>Following the strike by merchants and residents at Zhabei Dayang Bridge two days ago due to the soldiers of the security forces committing violence, shops in Lidi Port (behind Dayang Bridge) also joined the strike yesterday. The authorities' attempts to persuade them to resume business were unsuccessful. The striking merchants submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, requesting the punishment of the culprits and appealing to Yu Qiaqing to uphold justice. The Citizens' Association and other organizations held meetings to offer assistance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dispute Intensifies: There are more than thirty shops in Dayang Bridge. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, after all the shops went on strike due to security force soldiers unjustifiably gathering a crowd and beating Sun Guifang, the owner of Hesheng Rice Store, and his partner Huang Yuru, causing injuries, the strike continued yesterday morning as the authorities had not taken appropriate measures. Furthermore, over thirty shops, including Wanyuxing and Zhenfeng, in Lidi Port behind Dayang Bridge, joined the strike yesterday morning in support, as the case had not been resolved. In total, over seventy shops participated, and the situation suddenly escalated. Persuasion Ineffective: The Dayang Temple Branch of the Fourth District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau dispatched Inspectors Zhu Liming and Yang Jintang at 8:37 yesterday morning. The Dayang Bridge First Branch of the Eighth District of the City Defense Corps also sent Platoon Leaders Dai Guangzu and Li Shouhai to persuade the shops to reopen. However, the residents continued to strike, citing the lack of a resolution to the dispute. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, and the First Citizens' Association also sent representative Cai Jun to offer persuasion.</p>
<p>Appeal to Yu for Mediation: At 9:40 yesterday morning, merchants and residents from the area sent representatives Yang Yi, Fan Yongtai, Zhang Mengkui, Wu Mengxiong, and Yang Fuqi to Yu Qiaqing with a letter requesting his intervention. (This was because Bu Wenbin, the commander of the security force in charge, had indulged his soldiers in committing violence and forced Sun Guifang of Hesheng Xieji Rice Store to (1) publish an apology to the security force in the newspaper within three days, (2) not to go on strike, and (3) not to release any information, otherwise he would still be arrested.) Yu expressed that he would definitely meet with Yang Hu, the director of the Security Bureau, to investigate the unlawful behavior of the soldiers. The representatives were satisfied and returned to their shops. Currently, the shops in the area have decided to submit another petition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Federation, requesting them to jointly mediate.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: Simultaneously, a petition was submitted to the Municipal Government, stating: "Submitting this petition regarding Security Force Commander Bu's indulgence of his soldiers in causing trouble and oppressing merchants and residents. We humbly request your review and approval, and to promptly dismiss and investigate him to rectify official conduct and appease public anger. We, the merchants, are all located on the east side of Dayang Bridge, specializing in business and not usually involved in other matters. However, Bu Wenbin, the commander of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Security Force stationed at the Yangzhou Guild Hall in Tanjia Bridge, previously resented Hesheng Rice Store for not allowing credit purchases of rice, as the store had been short of capital since the disaster and could not afford to extend credit to anyone. Therefore, soldiers from his company frequently harassed the store. The merchants, mindful of their business interests, did not argue. Yesterday (the 9th), at around 11 a.m., the company's cook came to Hesheng Rice Store to purchase two dou of rice. About an hour later, he returned, suddenly claiming that the measure of rice purchased was insufficient, and acted aggressively, making it impossible to reason with him. He then left and returned with eight or nine soldiers, who rushed in without asking questions and dared to commit violence, beating the partner Huang Yuru and tying him up to take him to the company. Inspector Jiang went to bail him out. Shortly after, more than ten soldiers returned, all armed, and broke into the shop. Without explanation, they grabbed the manager, Gui Fang, and beat him severely, injuring his back, face, and waist. They also tied him up with ropes and took him to the company like a major criminal. His arms were also severely injured by the ropes. The purpose of the security force is to protect the area and maintain peace, not to harm merchants and residents. Such indulgence of soldiers in rampant behavior and oppression of merchants and residents is alarming to witness and cannot be tolerated in silence. Moreover, we have no strength or courage to resist. We can only close our doors and wait for your government to resolve the issue. We believe that those who care about the people's welfare will not ignore this. Therefore, we jointly petition your department to promptly order the Security Bureau to dismiss and investigate Commander Bu to rectify official conduct and ensure the safety of commerce. This would be a truly virtuous act."</p>
<p>Assistance from Various Sectors: The First Special District Citizens' Association held a meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday and decided to (1) send Zhang Yichen and Zhang Xianfang to express their condolences, (2) petition the municipal government to maintain the commercial situation. Their condolence letter stated: "To whom it may concern: We have received your letter regarding the security force's violent beating and arrest due to unsuccessful credit rice purchases. We have learned of the situation and the Third Standing Committee of this Association has decided to send Zhang Yichen and Zhang Xianfang as representatives to successively persuade you to resume business and to petition the municipal government to maintain the commercial situation. We hereby reply in writing, hoping you will take note of it." Furthermore, the Rice Merchants' Association also held a meeting yesterday and decided to petition the authorities to stop the situation.</p>
<p>Letter to the Security Bureau: After receiving the official letter from the Dayang Bridge shops, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Director Yang of the Municipal Security Bureau, stating: "To whom it may concern: On the 11th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Dayang Bridge shops, including Lao Baohe Xinji, Dachang Plank Wood Store, Shunxingzhai XInji, Jinsen Tai, Tongxing Pawnshop, Zhang Zhenchang Sauce Garden, Xu Tongchun, Yang Wanxing, Wei Tongtai, Yongcheng Glass Hardware Store, Hong Kong Branch, Qingdabinji Store, Xindingxing, Tongtaihe, Yiheju, Xinzhenxing Beef Restaurant, Xu Guangsheng Store, Zhihecheng Store, Guishuntai, Taili Store, Yang Wanshun, Maofeng Store, Xinzhenxin Clock Store, Tang Wanyuan Nail Shoe Store, Shen Zhaofeng Noodle Shop, and Lixing Rice Store, stating: 'We, the shops, have been operating in Dayang Bridge, Zhabei, for many years and have always adhered to the principle of fair trade, treating both old and young equally. However, Commander Bu of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Security Force stationed at the Yangzhou Guild Hall in Tanjia Bridge previously requested credit purchases of rice from Hesheng Rice Store. Because the store has been short of capital since the disaster and could not afford to extend credit to anyone, he harbored resentment. Therefore, soldiers from his company frequently harassed the store. Mindful of our business interests, we did not argue. Yesterday, at around 11 a.m., the company's cook came to the store to purchase two dou of rice. About an hour later, he returned, suddenly claiming that the weight of rice purchased was insufficient and acted aggressively, making it impossible to reason with him. He then left and returned with eight or nine soldiers, who rushed in without asking questions and dared to commit violence, beating the partner Wang Yuru and tying him up to take him to the company. Inspector Zhang went to bail him out without success. Later, more than ten soldiers returned, armed with guns, and broke into the shop. Without explanation, they grabbed the manager, Sun Guifang, and beat him severely, injuring his back, face, and waist with gun butts and leather belts. They also tied him up with ropes and took him to the company like a major criminal, beating him along the way. Both of his arms were also severely injured. Such indulgence of soldiers in rampant behavior and oppression of merchants and residents means that there is no security in the area, and shops are instead being harassed. If this is not addressed, merchants and residents will feel that they must be wary. If we do not act now, the consequences will be dire. Therefore, we jointly request your association to uphold justice and do your best to help us. We have long admired your association as the leader of all merchants and believe that you are aware of the suffering of merchants and will not ignore it. We urge you to handle this matter fairly, so that merchants and residents do not suffer invisible harm, and to maintain commerce and reassure the people. This would be a public service.' Upon receiving the letter, we have investigated and found that the incident was reportedly caused by a dispute over unsuccessful credit purchases. Even if the weight of rice purchased was truly insufficient, and it was not an excuse to cause trouble, the head of the company's catering staff should have reasoned with the shop. They should not have gathered a crowd, carried weapons, and used force without authorization, beating the shop partner and manager, and tying them up to take them to the company. All of this is contrary to military discipline and easily creates a negative impression of the military among the people. We hereby request your commander to investigate the soldiers involved in the incident separately, give them appropriate punishments, and admonish your subordinates to strictly enforce military discipline. This is our sincere request. To Commander Yang of the Shanghai Municipal Security Bureau."</p>
<p>Dispatch of Personnel for Investigation: In addition to forwarding the letter to the Security Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has dispatched Yuan Mingjun, a staff member of the Commerce Section, to investigate the matter and comfort the merchants and residents, urging them to resume business as usual and await resolution.</p>
<p>Another Dispute: On West Hai Chang Road, a soldier from the Security Force, No. 1983 (residing at No. 529 Hai Chang Road), poured cold water on residents who were urinating in the alleyway. More than ten people were affected, one of whom was a coolie who died yesterday from the cold water. The residents of the area, considering the soldier to be bullying others, gathered last night and decided to (1) petition the Municipal Government and the Municipal Security Bureau to dismiss the violent soldier, (2) petition the authorities tomorrow (the 12th), and (3) demand compensation for all losses.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Applying for Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Certificates; Penalties According to Ministry Regulations for Overdue Applications</h3>
<p>Following the transfer of tobacco and alcohol license tax collection to local governments starting July 1st, the collection of this tax in this city is handled by the four tax collection offices in the east, south, west, and north designated by the Finance Bureau. The bureau has issued public notices to inform everyone. It is reported that Ministry regulations stipulate that new licenses must be renewed every quarter, and the bureau has issued public notices to inform everyone that the renewal period cannot be exceeded. If a new license has not been renewed after the deadline, the tax collection agency will issue a warning. If a new license is still not renewed within ten days of the warning, in addition to being ordered to pay the tax and renew the license, a fine of 10% to 20% of the quarterly tax amount will be imposed according to the regulations. The autumn license renewal period has now expired. According to the Finance Bureau, many tobacco and alcohol merchants have enthusiastically applied for licenses from the tax collection offices. However, due to this being the start of the takeover, many merchants were not fully informed and have not yet renewed their licenses. The bureau has decided to issue a notice to inform them and set a deadline for applying for license renewals. Those who fail to apply within the deadline will be penalized according to Ministry regulations. It is also reported that after the Municipal Finance Bureau took over the tobacco and alcohol license tax, all license grades and tax amounts will be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax and their implementation rules. These regulations are uniformly implemented nationwide, and this city cannot be an exception. However, in addition to collecting taxes according to the amount, no handling fees will be charged. As for merchants who have previously obtained licenses and need to change to a different type of license due to business expansion, they must report the correction at any time.</p>

<h3>The Lawyers' Association Formulates Fundamental Measures to Stop Electric Torture: Interrogation Not Restricted by Police Station Confessions; Police Station Lawyers Should Not Be Invited to Take the Upper Seat; Letter Sent to the President of the First Special District Court to Offer Advice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, regarding the case of Cai Yangqi and his wife suing Lang Zuyin, a detective of the Old Gate Police Station in the Shanghai Public Concession, for causing disability by privately using electric torture, sent a letter yesterday to the President of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, stating: "We have heard that your court has accepted the case of Cai Yangqi and his wife suing Lang Zuyin, a detective of the Old Gate Police Station in the Shanghai Public Concession, for causing disability by privately using electric torture. Five summonses have been issued for interrogation, but the defendant has refused to appear. The police station in charge has also returned the summons from your court without reason. Although the victory resulting from your court's legal struggle against the department based on the agreement remains to be seen, all of our colleagues deeply admire your court's hard work in safeguarding legal rights. However, our association has some concerns regarding this case that we must express. We would like to present them to your court. It is our understanding that the police station's illegal use of electric torture to extract confessions from defendants is a common occurrence. However, most of those who suffer from it are weak and helpless individuals who have no way to appeal for justice or seek relief. In addition, it is difficult to collect evidence, and the injuries are not obvious. Even if others want to redress their grievances, they find it difficult to do so. We do not know how many people have died unjustly under the electric light, and it is extremely painful to speak of. However, the reason why the police station disregards the illegal use of electric torture on defendants is simply to force confessions from them. The reason why they attach so much importance to these confessions and disregard the use of electric torture to obtain them is that the courts routinely adopt these confessions as the basis for judgment. Fortunately, the source of the problem lies there and not here, so it is important to be aware of this. According to the current police station's handling procedures, regardless of the defendant, once they are arrested by the police station, the detectives immediately interrogate them and have the defendant put their fingerprints on a confession. The next morning, at the court hearing, the police station presents the confession to the court as evidence of the defendant's admission. The court often does not investigate and simply attaches the confession to the file as the basis for the judgment. Subsequently, when the defendant wants to argue that they are innocent, the judge is already biased, and the effect is very limited. The police station's plan is greatly successful, and the use of electric torture is greatly enhanced. The only way to remedy this is for the judge to base their decision solely on the defendant's testimony in court and not be bound by the confession submitted by the police station. This is in accordance with the spirit of Articles 64, 280, and 281 of the Criminal Procedure Law. If this is done, the police station's confession will no longer have the effect of absolute evidence, and even the most cruel methods will be ineffective. We hope that you will consider our humble opinion. Furthermore, the loss of legal rights is never a matter of one day or one night. The past events of the former Mixed Court can serve as a lesson. Since the establishment of the Special District Court, most of the legal rights that had been lost have been recovered. However, judges have often been unfamiliar with the local situation and social conditions in Shanghai. The police station's approval is immediately accepted, and the police station's disapproval is immediately followed. The investigation of criminal evidence and the suspension of the defendant's detention are often decided according to the opinions of the police station's lawyers and detectives. This has far-reaching and endless consequences. Even considering the position of the courtroom, the police station's lawyer is also a member of our association. In the courtroom, they must be given the upper seat. Any party who is unfamiliar with the legal system may suspect that there is another police station judge in addition to the judges and prosecutors. All of these matters, although trivial, are of great importance to the legal rights of the Shanghai concession. Therefore, we dare to follow the ancient saying that those who speak out are not guilty, and those who listen should take heed, and present these matters to you for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Results of the Forensic Examination of Cai Yangqi's Blood by the Forensic Institute —Detailed Explanation in Three Sections— Determining that the Liquid in the Glass Bottle is Human Blood, Answering Various Questions Based on Scientific Understanding, Establishing the Credibility of Cai's Account of Being Subjected to Electric Shock and Waterboarding, and that These Two Tortures Can Induce Recurrence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, etc.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Local Court recently accepted a complaint from Cai Fan, wife of Cai Yangqi, against Lang Zuyin, a detective of the Laozha Concession Police Station, accusing him of using electric shock to coerce her husband, Cai Yangqi, into confessing to a theft case, resulting in physical injury. After several court sessions, Lang failed to appear despite being summoned. The complainant, seeking to prove that Cai Yangqi's injury was real, presented a glass bottle containing blood, claiming it was what Cai vomited after the torture. To ensure thoroughness, the court ordered the resident forensic doctor to draw fresh blood from Cai, smear it on a glass slide, and, along with the blood-filled bottle, dispatch a police officer on May 31st with a letter to the Forensic Institute of the Judicial Administration Department in Zhenru. They requested an examination to determine if the liquid in the bottle was human blood, and if so, whether it was from the same person as the blood on the glass slide. If from the same person, they asked if the bottle contained blood vomited due to injury. The institute's director, Lin Ji, on June 15th, handed over the glass bottle and slide to the institute's Material Evidence Examination Department, Serum Examination Department, and Ultraviolet Light Analysis Department for detailed examination. They conducted a re-examination on June 25th. The results showed that the blood in the bottle, having been stored for several months, was long decomposed, thus only confirming it was human blood but not determining from which part of the body it originated. Director Lin prepared a certificate of authentication and sent it back to the court for reference. However, seeking clarity on Cai Yangqi's actual physical condition, the court, while acknowledging previous examinations by the court's forensic doctor and Nanyang Hospital, still considered a re-examination necessary. Thus, on the 26th of last month, they again dispatched a police officer to Zhenru with Cai Yangqi. On the same day, Director Lin assigned two physicians to conduct examinations in the institute's Human Evidence Examination Room, Pathology Examination Room, Medical Chemistry Examination Room, Serum Bacteriology Examination Room, X-ray Room, and Photography Room. On the 28th, Director Lin personally conducted a detailed re-examination. The day before yesterday, they specially prepared an examination report detailing these examinations and sent it back to the First Special Court for reference. The report's contents were exceptionally precise and detailed, which are now transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Examination (A) Previous History Cai Yangqi, male, 34 years old, native of Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, employed as a domestic helper, alleged that on February 17th of the lunar calendar, he was suspected of theft and first taken to the Public Security Bureau, then transferred to the Laozha Police Station, where he was subjected to electric shock and waterboarding to force a confession, repeatedly losing consciousness and then being revived. On February 28th of the lunar calendar, he was released by the First Special District Local Court. However, his body was ravaged, and he contracted a serious illness, having consulted Chinese medicine practitioner Zeng Ziyun and sought treatment at Nanyang Hospital, all without recovery. He has filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Detective Bao Defu, Lang Zuyin, and others for false accusation and injury. He has been escorted here by a police officer dispatched by the court to undergo a body examination to facilitate a verdict.</p>
<p>Appendix: Record of Director of This Institute's Interrogation of Cai Yangqi (June 26th Afternoon) Cai Yangqi, 34 years old, native of Chongming, employed as an old steward, was arrested and taken to the Public Security Bureau on February 17th of the lunar calendar on suspicion of theft. Three days later, he was transferred to the Laozha Police Station by Detective Bao. During the interrogation on February 21st, they placed me on a chair, tied my hands behind me, and used a finger-thick tubular electric device with an electric wire inside. One end emitted electric sparks, burning my chest skin. I immediately felt intense pain and spasms. After two hours, I lost consciousness. But once the device was removed from my skin, the pain and numbness stopped immediately. There was no redness or swelling on the surface. However, after the third day of torture, my chest could not be straightened. If I forced it, I felt pain. On the first day, I was subjected to electric shock six times, on the second day six times, and on the third day five times. Each time I was tortured, I lost consciousness. After being sprayed with cold water and massaged, I would wake up. At this time, I felt dizzy and my chest and ribs were extremely painful. On the fourth day, they did not use electric shock, but tied me to a bed and used a lead teapot filled with ice water to force-feed me through my mouth and nose, swallowing it, my stomach and intestines bloated, and I was half-conscious. Then Detective Bao used both hands to push upwards vigorously on my chest and abdomen, and I vomited the water, with blood and froth, and they stopped. They made me stand up. After that, I was not tortured again. However, I felt numbness all over my body and pain in my chest. On February 28th, I was released from the Xinyamen and went home. The area under my left breast and my back still ached and I felt exhausted. My abdomen was hot, my appetite was poor, and I felt dull numbness in my skin and joints. My left chest and back still hurt, and I had a dry cough. On the second and third of the first lunar month, my sputum was tinged with blood. By the twelfth and thirteenth, I was vomiting large amounts of blood. I did not cough or have phlegm when I vomited. It was about one spittoon full. From the fourteenth onwards, I did not vomit as much, but the pain in my chest worsened, especially when breathing. On the twenty-first and twenty-second, I vomited blood again, about one spittoon full. After vomiting, my face was pale, my heart was racing, and I could not sleep at night. On the twenty-third, I consulted Chinese medicine practitioner Cao Ziyun for three consecutive days, and I stopped vomiting blood and could sleep at night. But the left side of my chest and back still hurt. On May 18th of the national calendar, I entered Nanyang Hospital. My father died of trismus at the age of 40. My mother is currently 65 years old, alive and healthy, and has no history of mental disorders or venereal disease. I do not drink or smoke, and have not suffered from infectious diseases. Denies venereal disease (blood taken to the Serum Bacteriology Examination Room for Wassermann and Kahn tests for syphilis reaction). No traces of buboes in both inguinal regions. No secretions flow out when the external opening of the urethra is pressed. (B) Current Physical Examination Cai Yangqi has a medium build, slightly thin and weak, weighing 32 pounds and standing 172 cm tall. His skin is dry and brown. His cheeks are slightly flushed. His back is slightly hunched, and he walks normally. He appears calm. His eyes are bright, and his pupils react normally. His eye muscles also move normally. There is no twitching or frowning of the corners of his mouth. All movements are free from tremors. His voice is normal. His eyelids twitch slightly. His mucous membranes are pale. His hearing and taste are normal. There are no points of tenderness on any part of his scalp. His oral cavity and throat are normal. There is no swelling of the cervical lymph nodes. There are two oval scars below his right ear (he says they are from sores he had in the past). Subcutaneous fat in the chest is underdeveloped. Ribs protrude under the skin. The supraclavicular fossa is deeply sunken. Percussion reveals a slight cavernous sound at the apex of the left lung. Heart sounds are normal. Auscultation reveals slight crackling sounds at the apex of the left lung. Crackling sounds can be heard in the hilar region when coughing. The skin below the left scapula on the back is tender, pointing to the right and connected to the middle of the spine, about the size of two silver coins. Therefore, the spine in that area is also tender, but not on the left side. Pain increases when pressed with a finger, indicating referred pain. The area below the scapula is hypersensitive to cold and heat, while the middle of the spine (approximately at the level of the 5th-7th thoracic vertebrae) is noticeably numb. According to the patient, this area has gradually improved after medical treatment. The area of pain was larger at the time, and the chest could hardly be straightened. Even slight deep breathing caused severe pain. Auscultation reveals no signs. Percussion reveals a slightly dull sound, which is a sign of pleurisy that is healing. Abdominal percussion is normal. The abdominal wall is tense, and palpation reveals no abnormalities. There is no tenderness in the lumbar spine area. Movement of the pelvis and limbs and joints are all normal. Walking with eyes closed, his posture is also normal. However, when raising both arms, he feels a pulling pain in his chest. He is mentally normal. He reports that he often feels dizzy and drowsy after the torture. Plantar reflexes are dulled. Knee tendon reflexes are normal. Skin scratches are not overly sensitive, but rather slow to react. All movements seem slightly slow. A sputum sample from his morning cough was sent to the Bacteriology Examination Room for testing. Another blood sample was sent to the Pathology Examination Room and the Serum Bacteriology Room for testing. A urine sample was sent to the Medical Chemistry Room for testing. The results are detailed separately. (C) X-Ray Examination (1) Fluoroscopy Through Fluoroscopy, there are traces of old tuberculosis in the apex of the left lung. There is progressive pulmonary tuberculosis in both the upper and lower lobes of the entire lung. At the base of the left lung on the dorsal side, above the diaphragm, there is an area of mixed opacity the size of two silver coins, indicating a shadow of healing pleurisy. After fasting for ten hours, 75cc of Citobaryum was ingested orally. Examination of the stomach and duodenum revealed no lesions. The spinal bones are also normal. (2) X-Ray Photography Observation, from the apex of the left lung to the intercostal space of the second rib, there is a uniform white shadow, indicating old pulmonary tuberculosis. The entire left lung shows signs of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, but there are no large cavities or other findings. Except for a mass of white shadow in the hilar region of the right lung, the rest of the area, as well as the trachea and spinal bones, are normal. There are no ulcers in the greater or lesser curvature, cardia, or pylorus of the stomach wall. (D) Medical Chemical and Serum Bacteriological Examination (1) Urine, approximately 60 cc, clear yellow in color, without turbidity or sediment, with a slightly acidic reaction. (1) Protein Examination, boiling method, negative, Pirrinsanre-negative. (2) Sugar Examination, Nylender scheme-negative, Fehlingsche scheme-negative. (3) Acetone Examination - negative. (2) Cough Sputum, macroscopically white, mixed with yellow lumps and black dust-like substances. The suspicious parts were smeared, fixed, and stained using the Zühl-Nielsen staining method. Microscopic examination revealed numerous tubercle bacilli, tetrad cocci, elastic fibers, and pus cells. (3) Blood Examination (1) Blood Cell Count, red blood cells counted using the Thoma-Zeiss method. The red blood cell count was 4,904,000. The formula is as follows: 4000 X 200 X 6.13 = 4904000. White blood cells were counted using the Thoma method. The number was 7,200. The formula is as follows: (34+38) X 20 X 400 / 800 = 7290. (2) Hemoglobin Level, the level measured using the Sahli method was 85% (3) Syphilis Test, five cc of blood was drawn from the examinee's cubital vein using a sterile syringe and Wassermann (Wasse r-Mann) and Kahn reactions were performed according to law. The results were positive, indicating that the stomach was infected with syphilis. (E) Diagnosis, has pleurisy, which is about to heal, leaving only a slight trace in the inner part below the left shoulder blade. The entire left lung has signs of pulmonary tuberculosis, and bacterial examination proves it to be an open body. The appearance is slightly anemic and emaciated, but blood tests show that the red blood cell count is not reduced and the hemoglobin level reaches 85%, which is a sign of recovery.</p>
<p>(B) Explanation (1) According to the previous physical examination of Cai Yangqi, X-ray examination, urine chemical examination, sputum microscopic examination, blood cell and hemoglobin examination, it can be proved that the examinee has suffered from left-sided pleurisy in recent months, but it is now tending to heal, with only a small residual part left below the left back. With further rest and treatment, it can be cured. However, the apex of the left lung has been suffering from tuberculosis (pulmonary tuberculosis), and it has recently spread to the upper and lower lobes of the left lung. Tubercle bacilli were found in the sputum, which is definitely an open type. If not handled properly, the sputum is enough to infect others. If the recuperation is poor, it can endanger life. The blood test also showed that he belongs to the O blood group and shows evidence of previous syphilis, but there are no other signs. It can be seen that his mental aspects are all slightly dull, and his mind is now clear, with no special abnormalities. (2) According to the examination points listed in the incoming letter, Items 1 to 9, the examination results are referred to, and the answers are listed according to academic theory as follows. One, whether Cai Yangqi has ever been subjected to electric shock and cold water poured into his abdomen and lungs - according to the allegations in the case, even if the injury was actually caused by electric shock and cold water poured into the stomach and lungs on the date of the torture, there are no obvious signs now. However, the examinee's mental dullness, recurrence of pleurisy and lung disease, etc., can indeed occur due to multiple electric shocks and forced instillation of a large amount of cold water, but they can also occur due to other reasons. Two, whether Cai Yangqi's current lung disease and acute anemia and hemoptysis are caused by severe torture and forced instillation of cold water into the lungs and abdomen - according to what is called lung disease, it should be tuberculosis (pulmonary tuberculosis). The examinee has traces of old tuberculosis spots in the apex of his left lung, and progressive pulmonary tuberculosis in the upper and lower lobes of his left lung, and pulmonary tuberculosis should be caused by the transmission of tubercle bacilli. If there is a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, the local old symptoms can naturally be promoted to become progressive and spread once subjected to torture. The progression of pulmonary tuberculosis can lead to rupture of the pulmonary artery, which leads to massive bleeding and hemoptysis. This hemoptysis is caused by the rupture of the pulmonary artery, which is large in volume and can stop itself, which is in line with the examinee's own statement during the interview (according to the statement, on the fourth day, that is, the 23rd, he was subjected to waterboarding torture, and cold water was poured from the mouth and nose with a kettle, overflowing into the mouth and nose, and he swallowed a lot of it, and he was comatose, and then a detective forcibly massaged him in the chest and abdomen to vomit the water, with blood and froth, and the torture was stopped urgently. After he was made to stand up, he was released to the court on the 28th after interrogation, and he was sick in bed for several days after returning home, until the second and third days of the third lunar month, his sputum was tinged with blood, and then on the twelfth and thirteenth and twenty-first and second days, he vomited a large amount of blood, about two spittoons). If the pulmonary artery or a large blood vessel under the gastric mucosa were massively hemorrhaged due to electric shock or waterboarding, it would occur during or on the day of the torture, and a large amount of bleeding would occur after the torture. However, Cai Yangqi's first massive hemorrhage was nine or ten days (twelve or thirteen days) after the torture, so there is no direct relationship between the torture and massive hemoptysis. However, although the torture is not a direct cause of massive hemorrhage from the pulmonary artery or stomach, it is indeed possible to cause a recurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, after waterboarding, the person performing the torture forcibly massaged the chest and abdomen, resulting in frothy blood being vomited, which proves that the waterboarding at that time had caused a small part of the alveolar walls of the lungs to rupture small blood vessels, so water entered the lungs and the person fell into a coma, and forcibly vomiting water, water and froth carried blood. However, it did not cause a larger blood vessel to rupture at that time. If a large blood vessel ruptured, there should be a large amount of blood vomited during the forceful massage, and it should not be that a large blood vessel suddenly ruptured and bled again many days after the torture, when the violence was gone. This bleeding should not be due to the rupture of gastric blood vessels, because not only did X-ray examination of the stomach not reveal any traces of old bleeding, and there were no gastric epithelial cells or food debris in the blood test, but in terms of the matter, water was poured into the stomach, and the blood vessels of the stomach wall ruptured. Once the stomach wall is ruptured and vomited by massage, there should be a large amount of bleeding immediately, and there should be no large amount of bleeding at that time, no abdominal pain, and blood in the sputum. In short, electric shock and waterboarding are not necessarily direct causes of hemoptysis, but they can induce the recurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis, and thus can also be an indirect cause of subsequent massive hemoptysis. As for the cause of acute anemia, it may be due to a sudden massive loss of blood. After a massive loss of blood, the formed components in the body's blood are reduced, which is anemia. However, the examinee's appearance is thin and anemic, but the red blood cells and hemoglobin are not significantly reduced, and it has been gradually restored due to months of conditioning. If electric shock and forced instillation of cold water, what are the usual symptoms? According to what is known, there are various kinds of electric shock. According to what Cai Yangqi said, it is a kind of artificial small electric shock, in which the electric bubble is ejected from the catheter onto the skin of the person, and the person being tortured feels severe local pain, but once it stops, he only feels dull numbness in the skin, with no burns, redness, or swelling. However, prolonged continuous use can lead to tendinitis and neuritis. If used on the limbs, it can lead to limb spasms. If used directly on the chest, it can lead to pleurisy, chest and back pain, and the pain cannot be straightened. This skin is hypersensitive or numb. After the torture, there is dizziness, bone pain, and loss of appetite. After multiple electric shocks, the mind will fall into a coma, but cold water massage or cardiac stimulants and cooling agents can promote recovery. If cold water is forcibly poured into the stomach, the stomach will swell, and if it enters the lungs, it will suffocate. When suffocation is about to cause coma, the chest and abdomen are quickly massaged to expel the water, which can be recovered. Generally, after waterboarding, there are no symptoms other than temporary palpitations, suffocation, and coma. However, if too much water is poured into the lungs, suffocation will last for a long time and cannot be discharged, which can be fatal. Therefore, on balance, waterboarding is actually more dangerous than mild electric shock. Mild electric shock only causes burning pain and is not fatal, while pouring too much water into the lungs will be inevitable. The patient has a long history of pulmonary tuberculosis, which does not seem to be foreseeable during the torture. It is very dangerous to perform electric shock and waterboarding on patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Judging from the entire case, it seems that Cai Yangqi had previously recovered from lung disease, but waterboarding caused a small part of the alveolar wall blood vessels to bleed, and he was also subjected to electric shock, which induced pleurisy, which led to the recurrence of lung disease, and then massive hemoptysis, and fell into acute anemia. The torturous behavior of the detective and others is described vividly in the detailed interrogation of the examinee's confession. Everything described, as well as the onset of the disease, hemoptysis, and other processes, are quite consistent with the academic theory and the examination results, and are definitely not something that ordinary people can fabricate. This point should be noted. However, forceful massage of the chest and abdomen after waterboarding is actually a necessary measure, otherwise the water will not be discharged and will invade and cause suffocation and death. Forceful massage of the chest is the cause of rupture of the alveolar wall and small blood vessels. If the person has been subjected to electric shock, whether the skin of the electrically shocked area is charred, and what are the manifestations of electric shock and how long it takes to disappear, it depends on the size of the electric voltage used. If the voltage is small, it will cause severe pain during torture, and there will be no traces on the skin after torture, but the eyes will feel slightly dull and numb. If it is used several times, the mind will be faint, the bones will ache, and the local muscles and tendons will be inflamed and swollen. In those with larger ones, electric shock images can be produced, and the skin has burns. The voltage used in foreign electric death penalties must reach more than 3,000 watts. It is verified that Cai Yangqi's lung disease and hemoptysis, the first stage of which is about a few months away from the present. According to the previous statement, his hemoptysis does not seem to be due to the stomach, but to the lungs, so his hemoptysis is a symptom of lung disease. The progression of pulmonary tuberculosis can lead to rupture of the pulmonary artery, which can lead to massive hemorrhage, but it can stop itself due to the coagulation of the bleeding. In this examination, the pulmonary tuberculosis part of the apex of his left lung is an old trace, at least several years to the recurrence period, then the upper and lower lobes of the left lung have progressive phenomena, but the symptoms are not severe and the patient's physical strength (according to his own statement, he is now getting better day by day, and the blood test hemoglobin and blood cell count have also recovered) and gradually recover. It can be seen that the period of the patient's lung disease has been more than four or five months, otherwise the symptoms should not be so mild during the progression period, and the physical strength is gradually recovering. However, its exact period cannot be determined scientifically and during the examination period of this case. As for the bleeding part, it cannot be examined and cannot be speculated the date of bleeding. However, judging from the putrefaction of the blood samples sent for examination in the same case, the human blood should have been discharged in about four to six months. If subjected to electric shock, is the nerve reaction particularly obvious? The reflex function should have considerable signs. However, it is either hypersensitive or numb, which is not consistent. It can be cured over time. According to the previous examination, Cai Yangqi only had plantar reflexes, and the skin reaction was numb, and all his actions were slow. The skin in the lower part of the thoracic spine was not sensitive to cold and heat, and there was nothing else abnormal, or because several months had passed, and he was lying quietly in the hospital, and he had gradually recovered. If cold water is forcibly instilled, can it cause pleurisy and bubbling sounds in the lungs? No, but bubbling sounds can be heard during auscultation when pulmonary tuberculosis has sputum, and a dull sound can be heard during percussion. However, pouring water into the lungs can cause pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage and recurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Also, although forcibly pouring cold water does not immediately cause pleurisy, electric shock to the chest and forceful massage of the chest, and other chest injuries, do indeed have the possibility of inducing pleurisy. After the lungs are stimulated, how long does it take for hemoptysis to occur? Direct violence, such as heavy strikes, should cause hemoptysis immediately. If the chest is forcibly pressed, it can also cause bleeding from the alveolar small blood vessels, but there is less bleeding, and the injury induces the recurrence or aggravation of pulmonary tuberculosis. It is necessary to wait until the lesions extend to the larger blood vessel walls such as the pulmonary artery before a temporary massive hemorrhage can occur. The period depends on the speed of the disease mechanism, ranging from several days to several years. It is not certain. How are Cai Yangqi's current injuries? Has it reached the point of disability? Regarding all the pleurisy parts, it is getting better day by day. If there are no other increases and the cause of the disease has occurred, it can be completely cured after lying quietly for another half a month. However, pleurisy is easy to recur due to minor causes such as colds or external injuries, and attention should be paid. Regarding the pulmonary tuberculosis part, the upper and lower lobes of the left lung are currently in progress. Tubercle bacilli were found in the sputum, which is infectious. However, the patient's physical strength and symptoms are improving day by day, so the prognosis should be good. If you can get a long-term recuperation for about one or two years, you may be completely cured and not life-threatening. However, within one or two years, you must not engage in labor or receive external injuries to the chest, otherwise you will be unlucky.</p>
<p>(C) Conclusion According to the previous examination and explanation, it can be proved that the examinee Cai Yangqi has long suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis in the apex of his left lung, and has recently extended to the upper and lower lobes of the left lung. The pulmonary tuberculosis is in progress, and tubercle bacilli have been found in the sputum, so it is infectious. If not properly recuperated for one or two years, there is a risk to life. During the recuperation period, you must not engage in labor or be injured again. His pleurisy is about to be completely cured, and now only a slight trace is left below the left back. Mental demeanor all slow, reflexes mostly pure hemp, but can also be quiet treatment and cure. Regarding whether he was subjected to electric shock and waterboarding, it has been half a year since the case occurred and the date of sending it to the institute for examination, and no special signs have been found. However, the inquire about the examinee's entire situation is still in line with academic theory, and it is by no means that ordinary people can say it. His reflex pure hemp can also be a sign left over after the electric shock. As for those who are subjected to waterboarding and electric shock, there is a possibility of inducing pleurisy and recurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis, and massive hemoptysis can be due to the recurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis, which leads to hemorrhage of the pulmonary artery, and the individual falls into acute anemia. Therefore, the cause of massive hemoptysis is not directly due to electric shock and waterboarding (massive hemoptysis did not occur after electric shock and waterboarding), but electric shock and waterboarding can indeed be a large indirect cause of inducing pulmonary tuberculosis recurrence and massive hemoptysis. For the rest of the points of inquiry, the details are explained in the previous explanation, and please refer to and investigate other evidence to assist in the decision. The right diagnosis and explanation is fair, impartial and true. You must explain.</p>
<h3>Law Enforcement Appeal Regarding Zhang Zuming, et al.: Unsatisfied with the Preliminary Trial Verdict of the Special No. 2 Court in the Attorney Yan Fraud Case, a Strict Investigation is Ordered</h3>
<p>In the case involving the burglary at the Edward Road No. 9 office of the British accountant, Xue Mailuo, in the French Concession, on the afternoon of the 9th of last month, where a large sum of 12,000 yuan was stolen, the four Ningbo natives, Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and the Taicang native, Tang Qingyue, have been investigated and tried by the Second Special District Court. The court found that there was no active evidence of crime against the defendants. Therefore, the four defendants were declared not guilty, and the plaintiff's claims in the related civil suit were rejected. The detailed reasons for the judgment have been published in various newspapers. However, the police department of the French Municipal Council expressed complete dissatisfaction with the reasons for the original trial verdict. It has now submitted reasons to the original court, appealing to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. It is reported that the Second Special District Court will immediately collect the files and submit them to the Third Branch of the High Court for review. It is also reported that the police department attaches great importance to the matter of attorney Yan Luqing and his client, Zhou Jinggeng, allegedly extorting 62,000 yuan from the families of the defendants to recover the stolen goods. Recently, Yan, Zhou, and related individuals, Tang Qingyue, and attorneys Sun and Chen, were summoned to the case for investigation. Although Yan only admitted to contacting them but denied receiving cash, the police department is still sending personnel to Ningbo to conduct a thorough investigation, hoping to obtain conclusive evidence and file a public prosecution.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Wang Tianzhui's Suicide: Not Due to Economic Hardship or Environment, But an Unspeakable Difficulty</h3>
<p>A traveler arrived at the Jinling Grand Hotel, No. 10 Taiyuan Lane, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, at 3 a.m. on the 6th of this month, claiming to be Wang Tianzuo, 32 years old, a local engaged in the foreign goods business. He rented Room 15 for lodging and stayed for three nights. On the afternoon of the 9th, he went out alone and returned to the hotel around 2 a.m. the next morning to sleep. For some unknown reason, he suddenly had a suicidal thought and swallowed poison. By 1 p.m. that day, the tea server, Zhang Xiaodi, knocked on the door to urge him to get up and collect the room fee. However, there was no response after calling for a long time, and it was known that something was wrong. The door was forced open and upon entry, Wang was found dead in bed. Chen Heqing in the accounting office was immediately notified, and the matter was reported to the French police. Investigators were dispatched to the scene and found a suicide note next to the deceased. The brief note stated that the reason for the suicide was not due to economic hardship or environment, but rather to an unspeakable difficulty. The note was signed Wang Tianzhu and included a certificate No. 11 from the Jiangsu Shatian Bureau directly under the Ministry of Finance, and three silver coins. Nothing else was found. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Since there were no relatives of the deceased, the Second Special Court was requested to send Prosecutor Wang Ren to the scene for inspection yesterday. The prosecutor confirmed that the deceased had died from poisoning before death, and ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing, encoffining, and burial. The belongings were stored in the warehouse for claim.</p>
<h3>Japanese Automobile Company Drivers on Strike: Demanding Wage Payment, No Response Yet, Fears of Incidents, Police Dispatched for Protection</h3>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the Senmurac Automobile Company at No. 256 Haining Road, owned by Japanese woman Daoshima Ying, who resides in Shanghai, has a flourishing business. It also has branch offices at No. 134 North Sichuan Road, No. 1755 Pingliang Road, and No. 577 Kangnuot Road. The company has over 20 rental automobiles and employs 36 Chinese drivers. Their salaries are calculated based on 6% of each driver's business income. The monthly salary for each driver ranges from 20+ yuan to 12-13 yuan. Traditionally, customer accounts are settled on the 20th of each month, but the drivers' salaries are paid on the 1st of the following month. Recently, the company management suddenly cited difficulties in collecting customer fees and postponed salary payments to the 10th of each month. The drivers did not object. However, the 10th of this month has passed, and the salaries of the drivers have not been paid. They have repeatedly urged for payment, but have been met with evasive replies. As a result, the drivers' lives have been greatly affected. As a last resort, all the drivers from the head office and the three branch offices went on strike at 6 p.m. the night before last. The drivers, represented by Fu Axiang and others, collectively requested the company to immediately pay their salaries, otherwise they would never return to work. The company has not responded to this yet. However, after receiving this report, the police authorities, fearing incidents, have dispatched personnel to protect the company.</p>
<h3>Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs Pleads for Liu Chongwu, et al.: Sends Letter to the Second Branch of the High Court Requesting Acquittal or Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs sent a letter yesterday to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating (excerpt): Patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, and others, motivated by patriotic indignation, warned unscrupulous merchants, leading to legal trouble and imprisonment. The initial trial verdict was fair, except for part of Liu Chongwu's case. However, the police cited involvement in other cases and filed an appeal. The second trial judgment was biased and increased the sentences, causing public outrage. Fortunately, the Supreme Court saw the truth and returned the case to your court for retrial, hoping that the injustice could be redressed. Our association believes that these young people were motivated by righteous indignation and mistakenly violated the law. Their actions were impulsive and without malice. Therefore, their criminal circumstances deserve sympathy. If they were said to have premeditated the actions of others, what is murder? Premeditation must have solid and definite evidence and undeniable facts. One cannot be convicted based on abstract speculation. According to Chapter 4 of the Criminal Law regarding mitigation and exemption of punishment, Chapter 10 regarding the discretionary application of punishment, and Chapter 13 regarding suspended sentences, Liu and the others' actions should be considered for reduced or exempt punishment or suspended sentences. Therefore, we submit this letter to your court, requesting that after the retrial, the defendants be declared not guilty or granted a suspended sentence so that these young people can be influenced by the law and become patriotic and productive young citizens. The nation and society will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Careless Talk About Yangzhou Causes Disputes: Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow Association Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday - Chung Hwa Book Company States that the Author Should Bear Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>The book "Casual Talk About Yangzhou" published by Chung Hwa Book Company in Shanghai, written by Yi Junzuo, the Director of the Compilation and Review Section of the Jiangsu Department of Education, depicts the lives of the people of Yangzhou in chapters such as Yangzhou Life. However, the Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow Association of Shanghai believes that the text slanders their fellow villagers and convened an emergency meeting at the Association Hall in Renji Lane, Xinzha Bridge, at 3 p.m. yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Words Cause Trouble, Public Outrage Among Fellow Villagers: A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow Association of Shanghai yesterday morning. According to the person in charge of the association, the book "Casual Talk About Yangzhou" contains numerous slanders against their hometown, especially against women, with malicious insults. It even claims that all prostitutes in the country are run by women from Yangzhou, which is absurd. Therefore, the association has extracted the "content insulting all residents of Yangzhou" from the book and announced it to the public for judgment.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting Yesterday Afternoon: At 3 p.m. yesterday, the association held an emergency meeting at No. 22 Renji Lane, Xinzha Bridge.

Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow Association of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chung Hwa Book Company Expresses Its Attitude: A reporter from the Datong News Agency later visited Lu Xisan, the Chief of General Affairs at the Chung Hwa Book Company's General Factory on Jingan Temple Road. According to Lu, according to the publication law, the author should be responsible for any disputes arising from the book. Therefore, the company does not wish to express any opinions on this matter. However, since the book caused disputes, the company has stopped selling it.</p>
<p>Excerpts from "Casual Talk About Yangzhou": The Yangzhou Fellow Association of Shanghai is extracting the following excerpts of the so-called insulting to all residents of Yangzhou: (1) Such an elegant and vulgar Yangzhou, we do not need to examine its geography, just look at its history and its current state, and we can estimate the true value of Yangzhou. (2) Everywhere is a toilet. Many natives openly defecate in the lawns where men and women pass by. (3) However, there are also many chamber pots. Every day is a chamber pot world. Men carrying manure buckets and women pouring chamber pots brush and tease each other while chatting and laughing.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Case Occurred in Pudong Nanmatou the Night Before Last: The Kidnapped Victim is Boy Ma Baoming</h3>
<p>Chen Fengxiang, the deceased trustee of Pudong Nanmatou, passed away over ten years ago, leaving behind a wife, Ma, 50 years old, and a son, Baoming, 16 years old. Their residence is at No. 60 Xisanli Bridge, East Head of Nanmatou. Chen's estate is quite substantial, including real estate and seven or eight ice factories. Business is booming in the summer. Three years ago, Chen's wife built a new residence in the town, making them quite reputable in the surrounding area. Recently, they were targeted by bandits. Around 10 p.m. the night before last, Baoming, wearing a singlet and Indian silk pants, walked out of the old house, intending to sleep in the new house. Zhu Hanggeng, a long-time servant of the Chen family (49 years old, local), followed him. A few dozen steps from the door, four bandits dressed in black, speaking with local accents, called Baoming "little brother" and wanted to talk to him. Baoming, unaware of the danger, stopped to listen. The bandits took the opportunity to pull out pistols, aiming at the two men, and forced them to walk southeast. Under threat, the two had to follow the bandits. They walked east along Pudong Avenue and then turned south for about half a li. The bandits then dismissed the old servant and calmly took Baoming south. After being released, the servant rushed home to report the incident. At the same time, Officer Dai Baoqing of the Third Precinct, Third Sub-Precinct, stationed in the town, received the report and immediately telegraphed the Third Precinct. Director Dong, aware that the case involved kidnapping, immediately led Officer Xiao Jingfu and other police officers to pursue, going straight to the shore of Bailianjing Port, but there was no trace. It is speculated that the bandits had pre-rented a motorboat, parked on the beach, and after taking the hostage, sailed out into the Huangpu River. The plan was very meticulous. After returning to the precinct, Director Dong reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau for review and requested notification to all precincts for assistance in the arrest. However, as of last night, there was no news.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read the news column in your newspaper on the 6th of this month, titled "Hopes of the Cotton Control Association", in which Ri Ri News states that since the Ministry of Finance announced and implemented the new tariff rates for imported goods, the reduction in cotton yarn and daily necessities has caused concern among national goods manufacturers in Shanghai. After the reduction of these import tariffs, it will inevitably lead to the dumping of foreign goods (especially Japanese goods). Regarding the issue of reducing import tariffs on cotton yarn, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association has expressed serious concerns. The reporter asked the National Economic Committee Cotton Industry Control Association about this issue again yesterday. According to the talks, the new tariff rates for imported goods newly set by the Ministry of Finance this time have reduced the tariff on cotton yarn by 5%. In fact, it seems that it has not been carefully considered, and it seems to hinder the government's purpose of protecting industry, so it is inevitable that it will cause opposition from Chinese yarn merchants. It is now reported that the Japanese side has begun major activities. In addition to wanting to dump cotton yarn, it is also reported that other Japanese daily necessities will be shipped to China in large quantities to seek dumping. The Japanese side believes that the reduction of foreign import tariffs by our country this time is tantamount to gaining the opportunity to dump. Currently, this association has once jointly consulted with Chinese yarn merchants on the cotton yarn issue, and plans to conduct detailed research, contribute the difficult situation and opinions of the yarn industry to the government so that they can understand and reconsider the constitution, in order to change the tax collection method or directly withdraw the order, so that the yarn industry, which is struggling to survive, can be saved. This association has not had any staff member publish the above comments, which is inconsistent with the facts. Please correct it to avoid confusing the audience. This is very important. Sincerely, The National Economic Committee Cotton Industry Control Association, July 10, 1934.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments: I would like to thank the Bank Weekly for sending me a copy of Bank Weekly No. 857 yesterday, and I would also like to thank the Commercial Press for sending me a copy each of the English Weekly No. 89 and the Children's Pictorial No. 42. Thank you.</p>
<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3>The Practical Use of Social Sciences (Continued) — Answer to Mr. Yan Pu —</h3>
<p>We are doing this to understand society, not to get promoted or make a fortune. But why should we understand society? If it cannot solve our life problems at all, what are we going to do to understand it? Do we have to starve to death if we study social sciences? This question is also good. Of course, it is not only impossible to maintain our lives by studying social sciences alone, but even if it is possible, it will turn social sciences into Western-style stereotyped essays. If everyone in the whole society wants to rely on social sciences to eat, and does nothing else, can the society still be established? Personal life problems have various solutions due to the different conditions of the environment, skills, interests, etc. of individuals. It cannot be assumed that studying a certain science will directly "eat" this kind of knowledge. This is completely a harmful concept inherited from the imperial examination era. We must know that society is a whole organization. Today's society, and even the whole world, has a close and inseparable interrelationship between various parts and places. What happens in one part or place is bound to involve any other part. The US government in the Western Hemisphere buying silver can have a huge impact on the Chinese market in the Eastern Hemisphere. No part of the world can escape the overall influence, and personal life problems cannot escape the waves of the whole society. In the current economic panic in the whole society or the whole world, there are still many people who cannot solve their life problems even if they have skills, interests, and environment. It is simply impossible to solve personal life problems separately from the relationship of the whole society today; it is simply a dream. Of course, we also see a few lucky people now, but these people first need to have a special background, which is not achievable by the general public. Second, their lives stand on the heads of the masses, and they use the blood and sweat of the masses as sacrifices for their enjoyment. Moreover, such people are only a minority. Although they have solved their personal life problems, the lives of the masses of the whole society have been destroyed by them, making the social order even more chaotic. To fundamentally solve the life problems of every individual in the masses, we still have to start from the whole society. If we do not focus on society and only take the current interests of individuals as the standard, then don't say that studying social sciences cannot solve it for us, any other method will not do anything good for our masses. Even if an individual is fortunate enough to obtain temporary happiness, if it has nothing to do with the masses, it is definitely not a fundamental solution. For example, if you win the first prize in buying aviation lottery tickets, it is naturally not a problem for personal life and can be solved. However, only a few people out of hundreds of thousands can win the prize. This is not a way to solve the lives of the masses. If we realize that we are only a member of the hundreds of thousands of masses, then we must clearly recognize that this attempt to solve life problems by luck is the most dangerous. We must never entrust our lives to fate, we must never succumb to fate. We should see clearly the surroundings, see clearly the future, and then deal with everything with a positive attitude. Even if we inevitably fail at times, it is always more hopeful than the method of letting fate play with our eyes closed.</p>
<p>The only way to see clearly one's surroundings and future is to learn social sciences. Therefore, social sciences can really provide us with a fundamental method to solve life problems. The practical use of social sciences lies in this. This effect is not in the current, lucky, and ungraspable happiness, but in the permanent life of the majority of people. We have found the road that should be taken from social sciences, and we are moving forward along this road. Even if individuals inevitably fail at times, there will always be some help for everyone. It is always more certain than hitting with eyes closed. And those who only care about their own happiness and do not look at the trends of society are acting like they are crashing blindly.</p>
<p>Science is the most fundamental and only compass for us to solve life problems. We should firmly remember it and deeply believe in it. But at the same time, we must abandon the shallow and pragmatic view that remains from the imperial examination era.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Weekly Summer National Goods Food and Drink Special Issue</p>
<h3>Contributing Words: Two Staunch Supporters of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The summer heat is oppressive, and what the human body needs most is drinks. Whether on boats and cars, in restaurants, in parks, or even resting at home or working in the office, drinks are needed. Soda, orange juice, fruit syrup, etc., almost everyone wants to try. When it comes to banquets, there is also a need for beer, etc., as a product of fellowship.</p>
<p>But everyone should not drink soda, orange juice, and beer. If you drink, don't carelessly listen to the waiter's arrangements. Let many foreign goods give you a crazy drink. Recently, I met two tough guys who deserve to be leaders in truly promoting national goods, one is Mr. Cai Wuji and the other is Mr. Fang Yexian. I happened to be at the same table with them. Once, the waiter desperately poured foreign beer and foreign soda into everyone's glasses. Mr. Fang said, "Wait a minute, let me see the brand." After looking at it, the beer was not Yantai Beer, and the soda was not produced by Watson's, Yili, or Laodeji. The orange juice and fruit syrup were also not produced by Guanshengyuan Family Industry or American factories. Mr. Fang said to the waiter, "No, no, it must be changed." The waiter looked embarrassed. Mr. Fang said, "Then we won't drink it." After a while, the national goods drinks were brought. Once, Mr. Cai was entertaining guests, and the waiters brought foreign drinks one bottle after another. Mr. Cai carefully looked at them and implemented his inspection skills. After determining that they were not national goods, he returned all the soda. He insisted on buying national goods. The waiters all said that the gentlemen were buying them and they couldn't wait. Mr. Cai said, "That's okay." After a while, national goods soda and national goods beer were delivered. Everyone admired Mr. Cai's strong will. This seems to be a trivial matter, but if it is not stopped, it will have a great impact on the life and death of national goods. I hope that those who drink soda and beer will think carefully and not think that it is a small problem that is not worth making a fuss about. Taking advantage of this summer weather, we have specially produced a summer national goods food and drink special issue, on the one hand to arouse readers' interest in purchasing and using national goods, and on the other hand to expose the bad tempers of ordinary waiters.</p>
<h3>From Summer to National Goods Food and Drinks</h3>
<p>— Tong Suzhen</p>
<p>When the weather is very hot this year, we don't have the qualifications to go to Gulangyu or Moganshan, so we have to think about refreshing food and drinks. However, when we buy refreshing food and drinks, on the one hand, we have to buy genuine goods at fair prices, and on the other hand, we also have to pay attention to buying national goods, so that we can combine buying refreshing food and drinks with not forgetting the original intention of patriotism.</p>
<p>Fruit syrup is the most affordable and beautiful drink. It is both hygienic and can relieve the heat. When the sun sets and the twilight is vast, taking a cool under the bean trellis and melon rack, looking up at the moon, and feeling the breeze, a cup in hand is infinitely happy, especially in the very hot weather this year, epidemics are prevalent, and diseases are rampant. Compared with watermelon, it is more beneficial, because this year's watermelon may be related to the long-term drought, and it is inevitable that it will be harmful to the human body, so the fruit syrup can prevail in the market at this time.</p>
<p>Dried vegetables are also vegetarian dishes for the hot summer. They taste very good and the price is not expensive. Whether it is soaked in soup, cooked, or used as a vegetarian snack at home, it is also a very suitable food. It is very tasty and delicious. This is a summer essential in national goods. Compared with fish and meat on the table and delicacies filling the seat, it is more hygienic and palatable. Because under the rain of sweat, the best dried vegetables to eat avoid abdominal stagnation and cause river fish and other diseases. It is not advocating vegetarianism. It is originally more beneficial to eat vegetarian food in the summer, so in order to prevent problems before they occur and avoid disease from entering the mouth, dried vegetables are of course the best choice.</p>
<p>These two items can be said to be essential for every household. There are both refreshing drinks and wonderful dishes to help. With these two things in the summer, you can spend the summer safely. Women who are in charge of housework and take care of children, don't forget Guanshengyuan's fruit syrup and Weiyi Factory's dried vegetables!</p>
<p>When it's hot, we are happy to use national goods food and drinks, which also expresses a little sincerity in loving national goods. At the same time, we shout a new slogan, "Don't forget to love the country in the summer"!</p>
<h3>Summer Diet and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>It's midsummer. People who are attacked by the scorching heat are naturally all complaining about the heat. At the same time, no one does not feel the urgent need for various summer foods and drinks. You see the rows of cold drink stalls on the road, and the addition of ice rooms in the company. Of course, everything symbolizes the importance of summer foods and drinks.</p>
<p>However, here, we must also look at the alarming import of imported foods and drinks in past years from the historical process, and see how important a position they occupy in my country's import surplus figures, especially in summer. What soda! What beer! All kinds of cold drinks! The fierce dumping has already formed their market monopoly situation. It is really heartbreaking to say, and under this serious instruction, historical memories encourage us in this "Women's National Goods Year" on how to try our best to adopt national goods in the selection and purchase of summer foods and drinks and to publicize them widely in order to promote them, hoping to recover a part of the leaks, which goes without saying. Therefore, below, I dare to briefly introduce what I know··</p>
<p>Regarding the drinking aspect·· Cold drinks are an indispensable thing in summer. They are thirst-quenching and refreshing. They are needed everywhere. National goods such as Yili Soda, Guanshengyuan Fruit Syrup, Invincible Brand Fresh Orange Juice, Yantai Five-Star Beer, etc. are all cheap and beautiful, clean and fresh. You can try your best to adopt them. Why must you rely on imported goods and send thousands of dollars to foreign adults for their enjoyment? Regarding the eating aspect·· Summer food should first pay attention to cleanliness and hold the "vegetarianism" as much as possible to eliminate the danger of bacterial infection. After adopting vegetarian food, Samsung's Guanyin powder and Tianchu's MSG are both good seasonings, which are indispensable items in the kitchen. And other canned foods from national goods manufacturers are also made by scientific methods and are very fresh and clean, which can also help people add meals.</p>
<p>Finally, I still have a deep hope, that is, you will no longer like to entertain guests in this summer. National goods companies and shopping malls all have good catering departments. The location is cool and the price is cheap, which can provide guests with a place to stay. And you use national goods to entertain guests, and promote national goods in food and drink, what a meaningful and glorious thing it is!</p>
<h3>Rationalized Summer Refreshments</h3>
<p>— Zhao Fu Kui</p>
<p>Time flies so quickly. In the blink of an eye, the scorching summer has arrived again. This year's summer is especially different from previous years. The heat on the thermometer has risen above 100 degrees, making us feel the discomfort of summer. In this situation, summer drinks are undoubtedly a blessing for us to get through this</p>
<p>scorching summer.</p>
<p>How to solve the problem of summer heat? How to purchase summer drinks? This is a question, especially in this year of national goods, it has become a question worth discussing. Therefore, the ability of the *Shenbao* National Goods Weekly to issue a special issue to discuss this issue is not only suitable for needs, but also suitable for the season, and it may not be something of considerable value.</p>
<p>I believe that summer drinks should be based on the principle of rationalization. What are rationalized summer drinks? In short, they are domestic drinks. I often see many friends who eat orange juice, but they don't eat the orange juice from good domestic industries, they insist on eating foreign orange juice. They drink soda, but they don't drink the good Yili soda, they insist on drinking foreign soda. They eat ice cream, but they don't go to the ice cream parlors opened by Chinese people, they insist on going to the ice cream parlors opened by foreigners. Examples like these are countless. When I see this situation, I see the money of the Chinese people being sent to the pockets of foreigners batch after batch by these quasi-traitors who worship foreign goods and despise domestic goods. I feel extremely pained and express my twelve-fold regret and twelve-fold regret!</p>
<p>Therefore, now, I want to advise these Chinese people who worship foreign goods. Please wake up from now on. You must know that every bottle of foreign soda we drink is equivalent to supporting one more foreigner, and at the same time killing one more compatriot of the same race, language, and blood. If you eat more foreign things in the summer, you will support many more foreigners. Conversely, it means you are killing more Chinese compatriots. Friends, are you willing to be executioners who kill their own people? If not, then when you buy summer drinks, please be sure to buy domestic summer drinks.</p>
<h3>The Victory of Domestic Food and Beverages: Domestic Beer vs. Foreign Beer</h3>
<h3>Promoting National Goods Should Pay Special Attention to Summer Supplies</h3>
<p>— Ms. Tang Dunying</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and people's supplies have increased a lot. Because of the hot weather, an electric fan is not enough to relieve the heat; without cold drinks, it is difficult to quench thirst; because of the disturbance of mosquitoes, mosquito coils have to be used; to protect the skin and eliminate foul air, cosmetics are of course necessary; other items such as straw hats, parasols, silk stockings, undershirts, etc., as well as all kinds of gauze, silk, and cotton fabrics, are indispensable for ladies in summer. However, many of these items used to be imported, so every summer, those who promote foreign goods send a considerable amount of money to foreign countries, which is really heartbreaking to think about! In recent years, our country's industry and commerce have been able to catch up quickly, manufacturing various summer supplies one after another to supply the society, which is worthy of promotion! Not only are the quality excellent, but also the prices are low. The supplies needed now are generally available. Fellow compatriots who love to use national goods! During this summer, we should firmly resolve to use national goods and never be intoxicated by vanity and buy foreign goods, so as to avoid the outflow of rights and interests and preserve the original vitality for foreign countries! This should be given special attention!</p>
<h3>How to Solve the Summer Drink Problem — Ba Ling</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The facts tell us... "This year's summer is particularly hot. The mercury in the thermometer rises above 100 degrees, which is a common occurrence. It is a rare heat in recent decades!" According to friends familiar with astronomy, "The heat has a tendency to continue to increase." Judging from this, this year's summer life is a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>People living in Shanghai, except for the general self-reliant, hardworking compatriots who sell their blood and sweat, the rest of the middle class, as well as the general bourgeoisie, will not panic or have problems in this summer. They have money. Money is really omnipotent. With money, all problems can be declared solved. They have cars to travel outside, electric fans indoors, and can open a few bottles of Dutch water and orange juice to eat when they are thirsty. Such a life is so enviable for poor scholars like us who live by writing!</p>
<p>However, I have a few words to advise these wealthy old men, modern wives, modern grandmothers, modern ladies, and general modern young people who are well-fed and well-dressed. You must know that this year is the year of national goods. When you are planning to purchase summer food, please identify the goals, identify the responsibilities, identify the current critical state of the country, and decide to buy domestic summer products and drink domestic summer drinks to recover rights and interests and stop loopholes. I believe that all the modern figures in Shanghai, if they can wake up together, then domestic summer drinks will definitely sell well as a result, the outflow of money will definitely be reduced a lot, and the direct, indirect, tangible, and intangible promotion of national goods, relief of the unemployed masses, and preservation of national vitality, its merits are truly uncountable.</p>
<p>As for domestic summer drinks, such as the orange juice of the Yamei Family Industry, the soda of the Yili Watson Soda Factory, the milk of the Shengsheng Ranch, and ice cream, they are all top-quality goods, and they are even better than imported goods. I hope that people all over the country—especially those living in Shanghai—will earnestly buy domestic goods for this summer drink problem. You must know that if we eat imported goods, it is no different from swallowing bombs and poisons ourselves. Although we don't feel anything at the time, we will inevitably suffer unjustly and have seizures in the end. I think... a person who loves himself and others will definitely not do such an inappropriate thing!</p>
<h3>A Collection of Summer Food and Drinks</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengwu</p>
<p>In addition to three meals a day, every household always prepares some summer food and drinks. For families with children, the food and drinks must be especially clean, hygienic, and carefully attended to! Guanshengyuan's orange, lemon, banana, apple, etc.... fruit dew, Hu Qingyutang, Xu Zhongdao Chinese Medicine Store's honeysuckle dew, during this hot season, my family often buys them. When the room is hot and the chest is irritable, add a little fruit dew to cold boiled water and drink it. It is sweet, cool, and fragrant, and the mind is refreshed!</p>
<p>The soda and orange water of Watson Yili Company, after being frozen, are also extremely refreshing and can be said to be a good friend for relieving the summer heat!</p>
<p>Homemade mung bean soup, mixed with glutinous rice, with mint, and boiled water, eaten cold, is also a delicious afternoon snack! Floating plums in sweet wine and snow lotus root with ice are even more enjoyable in summer! Why must you drink foreign soda and foreign beer for fun?</p>
<p>In addition, West Lake lotus root powder, frozen tofu, shrimp mixed with</p>
<p>canned bamboo shoots, Wuxi canned gluten, and cold pickled vermicelli are all holy products for summer meals! Why bother with foreign Western food and Sullivan's cold dishes? Writing this in a hurry, the sultry heat is gone! A letter</p>
<h3>Repentance</h3>
<p>— You Zhi</p>
<p>Ping Ge;</p>
<p>Please still allow me to call you that. I humbly ask you to finish reading this letter. I am a guilty prisoner, please forgive me! Ping Ge! I want to find a spark that is about to be destroyed, in your despairing mood towards me, to save myself, and even more to save our past relationship.</p>
<p>I haven't received your letter for several days, and I'm waiting so impatiently, like an ant on a hot pot. I told my younger brother to wait at the door for the arrival of the green-clothed man, but three days, five days, seven days... passed, until today—the fourteenth day—in the evening, a registered letter was found in my younger brother's hand. Just by looking at the handwriting, I knew it was from you. The joy in my heart was truly a millionfold. Finally, I walked into the room tremblingly and opened the envelope. I read it with all my attention. Alas! It would have been better not to read it. I cried, I cried bitterly; you have rejected me! How can I read on? I fell on the bed, and the pillow was soaked with bitter tears. I regret my past actions, I shouldn't have ignored your sincere advice! It turns out that your rejection of me is entirely because I don't love to use national goods. Ping Ge! How ardent is your patriotism, how great is your personality, making people love you even more!</p>
<p>Ping Ge! You said that my reading is an ornament, no different from rings and high heels; you also said that I have no national concept, no national consciousness, and I am madly using foreign goods; you also said that I live extravagantly and cannot endure hardship. Yes, these are all my shortcomings, and they are also the reasons for your rejection of me. But let me swear to you today! I want to live my strict new life, not buying even half a cent of foreign goods, otherwise you can scold me, beat me, and reject me. In the past, my thoughts and actions were indeed too wrong. Now I have to change completely! Although I am a woman, I am also a member of society, and I am also considered to be knowledgeable. In this Chinese situation of imperialist aggression and rural economic bankruptcy, I should realize the importance and urgency of my mission to promote national goods! I want to be a useful person to the country! Only then can I be worthy of being your lover! Please boldly trust me!</p>
<p>As you said, my past life was controlled by vanity; I only knew how to enjoy, but I never thought about how I contributed to others? I only learned so-called fashion, but I didn't seek progress in thought. Yes, this is my psychological error. Ping Ge! Please guide me! Let me do a new life movement, turning everything of the traditional concepts, old life styles, upside down. All future things, like today!</p>
<p>Ping Ge! Please withdraw your order! I have laid bare my heart to you! I have repented! Give me a chance to renew myself! I think you will allow me no matter what! Good! Let us work together to engage in the national goods movement! At least, we have to sound an alarm in the current society, so that people who are sleeping soundly like me will wake up! Please accept a little bit of my meaning. I wish you</p>

<h3>Women's Circle Talks About Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jianhua</p>
<p>At this time, although our people's use of national goods is not as serious as that of the people of various countries in the East and West, at least the general intellectuals have been able to gradually transform their love of imported goods into a love of national goods. Judging from the increasing number of domestic products and the gradual addition of national goods stores in recent years, it can be seen that it is different from the previous years. This is not a good phenomenon. However, for the promotion of national goods and for the convenience of those who seek to use national goods, I feel that there are several points. I dare to contribute to the gentlemen who promote national goods.</p>
<p>(1) Set up more national goods joint stores, that is, take this city as an example. The location is vast. Chinese and leased areas. There are many shops and various department stores. However, it is really rare to find a store that completely sells national goods. Therefore, although our people have the intention to buy national goods, they often cannot rush to the national goods store to purchase due to time and location constraints, but immediately purchase from nearby stores. The shopkeepers value profit over righteousness, and</p>
<h3>A Few Questions? Xiao Bai</h3>
<p>A person even relies on foreigners for the most important things in his life—food and drink. I really don't understand whether this person is still warm-blooded or a cold-blooded animal?</p>
<p>"Import, import," what people generally call import is just referring to imported goods entering the customs. Now I see a large number of summer foods and drinks actually entering the mouths of compatriots. "Alas, there is no greater sadness than a dying heart." Which of these two terrible degrees is more profound?</p>
<p>Greedy for a moment of enjoyment, or chewing ice and drinking water, or in a drunken and smoky state, they do not hesitate to send a large amount of money, thousands and tens of thousands, to the foreign adults, leaving behind the root of national ruin and family destruction, and numbing their most vicious dumping. Do you think it's worth it?</p>
<h3>Two Jokes About Summer Domestic Drinks</h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>(1) The Jade Emperor Loses His Temper</p>
<p>"When I come back, shall I bring you some glass oranges to eat?" I saw that the Jade Emperor was terribly hot these days, so I asked him this when I went out yesterday.</p>
<p>"You can eat them yourself! People are so hot, and you're still looking for fun! Oranges made of glass, won't they cut through your stomach if you eat them? Do you really want to be a new groom again?" She glared at me, opened her bloody mouth, and argued with me. Later, with great difficulty, I pointed to the sky and swore, spent thirty-five minutes explaining, and bought a bottle of Invincible brand glass oranges nearby as evidence for my defense, and she smiled sweetly and made peace.</p>
<p>(2) The Deliveryman Exclaims Bad Luck</p>
<p>Yesterday I called the China National Goods Company and asked them to deliver two dozen domestic beers. The gentleman who answered the phone, probably from Hangzhou, spoke a little unclearly, saying "sister sister"; because there are many people from Hangzhou in major companies, I didn't care.</p>
<p>About two hours later, their deliveryman, carrying two yellow square boxes, walked in sweating profusely. When I looked at the item name on the invoice, it was two dozen leather balls. I knew that this gentleman from Hangzhou had made a mistake. While laughing, I told the deliveryman about this, and the deliveryman couldn't help but exclaim that it was bad luck.</p>

<p>are good at catering to the psychology and needs of customers for national goods. They use inferior goods to impersonate the original. Customers are unaware. They are often easily confused. The shopkeepers can sell foreign goods with low cost and high profit. For example, Mr. Tongju and others use Lux soap for washing. When asked why they don't use national goods, they said that they bought them in nearby small shops and the shopkeepers said that they were also national goods. The lack of development of national goods is a major reason. For today's plan, we can only ask the leaders of the national goods industry to discuss with various department stores or cloth stores, sock stores, etc. to agree to be national goods joint stores, all selling national goods supplies. The goods are supplied by the main store (national goods market). Must be notified and delivered at any time. Such stores are set up every few facades. Goods can be circulated to save location. The prices must be uniform. Even if customers leave this store for another, they will not be out of range. In this way, those who love to use national goods can buy national goods. Those who do not use national goods will have no foreign goods to use.</p>
<p>(2) Distribute discount coupons to treat customers favorably. Each joint store must have a number of customer discount books and gift coupons. Before the opening, distribute the books to each household one by one. For each purchase of more than one yuan, the money must be paid in cash, but it must be registered on the book. A five-corner or one-yuan coupon will be given for every ten or twenty yuan accumulated in purchases within a month or half a year. More coupons will be given in proportion. It can also be cashed. In this way, each customer can always be an old customer of the store. Schools and institutions should give more gifts to attract customers.</p>
<p>(3) Cheap prices, good quality, and warm hospitality. National goods are still in the budding stage. Promoters must have a spirit of sacrifice. As long as they don't lose money, the price must not be too high. It is especially taboo to sell inferior goods. Shop assistants must choose gentle and sincere people to serve, so that they treat customers warmly and do not speak sharply. This is a common problem in various stores and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>(4) Order and deliver goods without delay. If you encounter customized items, or if the store is out of stock, and you agree to deliver them on time, you must strictly observe the time and do not delay. Make customers very satisfied. Then, you can be sure that they will patronize you in the future.</p>
<p>The above points seem to be simple and feasible. Whether it is appropriate or not remains to be studied, so that we can plan a definite method to make the future of national goods shine brightly, which is what we all pray for.</p>
<h3>Two Unfashionable Summer Foods</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>(1) June Vegetarian</p>
<p>People in ordinary society always abstain from meat and fish and eat only vegetarian dishes in the hot summer weather. On the surface, it is somewhat superstitious, but in principle, it is in line with hygiene. Therefore, eating June vegetarian food should not only not be criticized, but we should also promote it. Because in hot weather, mosquitoes and flies gather, and meat and fish are most likely to spread germs; in addition, the fat content is too high, which is also not suitable for the body; it is better to have a vegetarian diet with a different flavor, and it will not cause problems. As for the ordinary vegetarian dishes, green vegetables, tofu, melons, and eggplants are planted by the villagers themselves, and they are authentic domestic goods. Some exquisite ones, such as fragrant mushrooms, hemp mushrooms, flat bamboo shoots, and seaweed, do not have any enemy goods mixed in. So this unfashionable June vegetarian food is not only hygienic, but also promotes national goods, we should really advocate it!</p>
<p>(2) Sliced Watermelon</p>
<p>Soda and ice cream are indeed cool, but may I ask whether the raw materials and manufacturing equipment inside these things are purely domestic goods? Moreover, the price is expensive, and it is definitely not something that ordinary people can eat to their heart's content. Looking at it this way, slicing watermelon to relieve the heat also promotes national goods and saves money. The ancients "floating melons and sinking plums" were originally a pleasure in the summer. Although this matter does not meet the conditions of modernity, soaking the melon in cool water, cutting it with a knife, and the juice splashing everywhere, holding it and chewing it is not necessarily an unpleasant thing. Some people say that eating melon is not hygienic, which is the view of a frog in a well! You think the melon flesh is wrapped in a thick melon skin, how can germs be mixed in? As long as you cut it open and eat it all at once; even if you can't finish it, cover it with a gauze cover to prevent mosquitoes and flies from biting it, and it will definitely not cause problems. Eating watermelon is also promoting national goods. Don't ignore it because the problem is small, and don't laugh at it as a step backward.</p>
<h3>Talking About Cold Dishes</h3>
<p>— Xu Jibo</p>
<p>Cold dish, also known as agar, also known as frozen noodles, the ancients called it frozen agar, the Japanese call it Kanten. The method of making it is very simple. After taking seaweed such as agar-agar, dry it, then soak it in fresh water to moisten it, and then use sunlight to bleach it. Pound it, boil it with water, and inject a little acid liquid (usually acetic acid, sulfuric acid, boric acid, vinegar). Boil it to a certain extent, filter the liquid, and inject it into a container of a certain volume to solidify the liquid. Then cut it into thin strips and cool it completely. It is an important position in vegetarian food, especially in this hot summer. If it is melted and frozen into jelly, adding a little mint liquid and sugar is one of the very good cold foods. Because of its cleanliness and hygiene, the value is not great. There are many people who use it to relieve the heat and quench thirst. There are also many vendors on the street who make this kind of jelly and sell it retail. The so-called banana jelly and rose jelly in restaurants are all made by melting cold dishes and freezing them. Even the jelly mixed with shredded chicken is also a seasonal dish now. So in this summer, the sales of cold dishes are particularly large, but where does it come from? It was indeed from Japan two years ago, but the production of seaweed such as agar-agar along the coast of our country is not small. In the past, there were factories in Guangdong and Fujian that manufactured it. Because the supply was not enough, Japanese goods took the opportunity to enter, and then took over the main position. Domestic agar was oppressed and disappeared. The annual imports reached seven or eight million yuan, which was a huge leak. After September 18th and January 28th, the Chinese people resisted inferior goods very enthusiastically. Japanese agar-agar was once unsalable. The Rusheng Factory in Ningbo took the opportunity to rise up, taking materials locally, and made cold dishes, which were sold on the market and were very popular among the Chinese people. It was once sold well, but this year a large number of inferior cold dishes have been imported one after another, and they are being dumped at low prices, so that no one cares about domestic goods anymore. The factory also had to reduce prices to sell them. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently sent a letter to the Southern Goods Industry and the Northern and Southern Goods Exchange Industry Guilds, advising them to sell domestic products. The letter said, "In the past, when there were no domestic cold dishes produced, it could be said that it was a matter of necessity to sell foreign goods. Now that the Chinese people have set up factories to imitate them, there are substitutes enough to cope with the world... I hope to urge the industry to sell domestic products for cold dishes and refuse to sell foreign goods..." etc. However, the dumping of Japanese goods is exhaustive, and I hope that consumers will pay attention to it. According to my experience, domestic products are slightly gray-black in appearance, uneven in thickness, not as white and uniform in thickness as Japanese products. The taste is not inferior to Japanese products. You must not see the cold dishes and cool your heart first. Who cares whether it is domestic or not?</p>
<h3>A Few Summer Supplies Worth Paying Attention To</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The reporter recently talked with a few friends who teach in schools. Talking east and west, unexpectedly, they talked about the national goods problem again. A pointed to B's straw hat and said, "Friend, you have to be careful. Now inferior straw hats are being dumped in large quantities. We shouldn't be greedy for cheap and be fooled by them! It is said that the cheap and good-quality straw hats on the market now are all inferior goods from the enemy. It's really extremely dangerous!" B pointed to A's undershirt and said, "Alas! Don't say that this straw hat is an enemy's inferior goods! We also have to be careful of the enemy's goods pretending to be our undershirts! A friend of mine bought two undershirts in a certain store, and he thought they were very satisfactory, because each one was only five or six cents. Unexpectedly, after buying them back, he wore two or three holes in a few days, and realized that he had been fooled by a certain country again..." At that time, while talking, friend A suddenly took out "Rendan", so I said to him, "Friend, you have to be careful of this Rendan too! Although there are several companies producing "Rendan Hong", the people of a certain country are cunning and slippery, and they often use inferior goods to pretend to be. So, we have to pay attention to it too!..." When the conversation came to this point, everyone sighed and was indignant for a while, thinking that from now on, they must not only be determined to buy national goods, but also be especially careful of counterfeit national goods, which must not be bought, because if you buy counterfeit national goods, not only will the money in your pockets be taken away by the people of a certain country, but you will also be ridiculed behind your back? This is really a very uneconomical thing.</p>
<p>After I separated from these friends, I returned to my residence and thought about this matter carefully. I felt that reed hats, Rendan, and undershirts were indeed indispensable things for our people in the summer, but we had to be prepared not to let the enemy's straw hats be worn on our heads, the enemy's undershirts be worn on our bodies, and the enemy's Rendan be eaten in our stomachs. Otherwise, if we are confused and perfunctory, it is hard to guarantee that these enemy goods will not run to our bodies, heads, and mouths?</p>
<p>How to prevent these enemy straw hats, undershirts, and Rendan from running to our bodies, heads, and mouths? I want to introduce a few reliable places to you, dear and beloved readers:</p>
<p>(1) Straw hats—please go to the trustworthy national goods factory</p>
<p>Follow the shape and shadow of the</p>
<p>Duohua Rong Women's National Goods Ling</p>
<p>, such as the Huafu Hat Company, etc., and you will never be fooled. Don't buy slippery straw hats without a license.</p>
<p>(2) Rendan—please go to Chinese pharmacies such as Zhongfa Pharmacy, etc., and don't buy slippery Rendan that is shouted along the way.</p>
<p>(3) Undershirts—please go to the famous national goods underwear factories, such as Jinglun and Wuhe underwear factories, etc., which can be said to be the most reliable.</p>
<h3>Is It Necessary to Have Foreign Words on Domestic Goods?</h3>
<p>— Liang Xiaohong</p>
<p>A friend who owns a factory manufacturing domestic goods asked me to draw a trademark or packaging design, always insisting that I include some English words. However, I was born with a strange temperament, unwilling to add any foreign words to domestic products. This obviously displeased my friend, who probably secretly mocked my stubbornness. In the early years of the Republic of China, Chinese people were enamored with foreign goods, and almost everything on the market was imported. The few domestic products available had to adopt foreign-style packaging to pass themselves off as foreign goods. But things are different now. The Chinese people have a deep and clear understanding of national consciousness and a considerable faith in domestic goods. Moreover, the creation and improvement of domestic goods have made astonishing progress. The call to promote domestic goods is on the lips of every enlightened person. Not only that, but the use of foreign languages is also being drastically reduced. Don't believe it? The subtitles of domestically produced films and the route signs of Chinese-owned tramcars have all eliminated explanations in foreign languages. This is a great example.</p>
<p>However, some merchants still retain this distorted view, believing that Chinese people still prefer foreign goods and have a naive mentality of praising any product with foreign-language packaging. Thus, to make a quick buck, they dress up perfectly good domestic products with packaging containing foreign words, sometimes without a single Chinese character. Not only that, but some even adopt foreign names, especially noticeable in the cigarette industry. As a result, the people who want to support domestic goods are filled with suspicion, unable to tell whether something is domestic or foreign.</p>
<p>Some say, "This is because they want to sell to foreign countries." That's simply a pipe dream! How many Chinese goods can be sold overseas? And even if they can, does that mean they can't be sold without foreign words? Do they all have Chinese text? This is clearly hindering national development and fostering the bad habit of Chinese people favoring foreign goods. If we want to promote domestic goods, we must first and foremost overthrow this distorted view!</p>
<h3>The Importance of Summer Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Langya Wang</p>
<p>Those with weak constitutions feel particularly miserable during the scorching heat of summer. To avoid this suffering, one should address the root cause by focusing on personal health. This is the only effective approach, and I have factual proof to share with readers. My younger brother-in-law, Xinfang, who worked for a British trading company two years ago, was overworked and physically weak. Every summer, even when the company was not particularly busy, he felt excessively tired and frequently fell ill. He did not take proper care of himself during that summer, and by autumn, he was on the verge of death. Fortunately, he was treated by the famous local doctor, Mr. Chen Cunren, and recovered. According to Mr. Chen, Xinfang had a yin-deficient and fire-excessive constitution, making him particularly sensitive to any tonics that were drying or greasy. He should regularly consume clear and nourishing Sichuan white fungus to regulate his system. He was also advised to increase his intake during the summer because the intense heat and rampant mosquitoes made it difficult to sleep early, further depleting his yin. White fungus is rich in yin-nourishing properties, which can both correct existing deficiencies and alleviate current difficulties. His physical strength would gradually improve, preventing illnesses in the fall. Xinfang is a clear example of this. Last summer, he was able to handle his work during the hottest periods with ease, showing no signs of fatigue. When purchasing white fungus, choose reliable products that prioritize quality over appearance and are free from sulfur fumigation. This ensures maximum nutritional value. As summer hygiene is of utmost importance, I have specially written this article for the research of people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Mom Loves Domestic Goods, Baby Loves Domestic Goods Too</h3>
<p>— Wang Wo</p>
<h3>National Goods Song</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yide</p>
<p>National goods are good, national goods are strong.</p>
<p>Chinese national goods are loudly praised.</p>
<p>New styles, clever prices.</p>
<p>Unlike foreign goods that emphasize appearance,</p>
<p>Their prices are ridiculously high.</p>
<p>The country is poor, due to imports exceeding exports.</p>
<p>Imports exceed exports all because of using foreign goods,</p>
<p>Forgetting Chinese products.</p>
<p>I advise all good Chinese compatriots,</p>
<p>To remember to promote national goods.</p>
<p>If we refuse to use all kinds of foreign goods,</p>
<p>Foreign goods will naturally disappear!</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Before Birth</h3>
<p>— He Qi Han</p>
<p>Juan's belly grows bigger every day. Calculating the gestation period, she is already nine months pregnant, so childbirth is imminent. Although Juan is already nineteen years old this year, she is still like a child and is very shy. She feels embarrassed to show herself because her belly is so big. If I didn't have a husband-wife relationship with her and were just accompanying her, she would probably blush all day and night.</p>
<p>Pregnancy, although the first miracle after our union, Juan had already spent countless days and nights planning everything after childbirth in her room. Seeing her commanding and planning, she seemed more experienced than anyone else.</p>
<p>Some say this is a woman's natural cleverness.</p>
<p>Whether it's a boy or a girl after birth, the first thing to solve is the baby's clothing. Juan wants to imitate the baby next door and buy some thin and beautiful shirts, woolen outerwear, pants, etc., and she wants me to pick everything from Western stores, saying that Chinese goods are not good-looking!</p>
<p>I certainly agree that baby clothes should imitate the thin and comfortable clothes worn by Westerners, and we shouldn't always follow the old Chinese custom of dressing babies in bulky clothing, which completely deprives the baby's body and limbs of freedom and hinders development. However, adopting Western goods is unnecessary. But I don't dare to openly contradict Juan's idea. I love Juan, and I don't want to create any unnecessary troubles during this pregnancy!</p>
<p>Today, Juan probably knows that childbirth is not far away, so she is urging me to buy all the baby clothes today. This really puts me in a difficult position because whether I listen to her or not creates problems. Just as I was secretly worried, unexpectedly, Juan's mother walked in smiling with a small suitcase in her hand. When she saw me and Juan, she happily said, "Wen! Juan! I know you two are about to have a baby, so I specially bought some small domestic clothes as a gift for you!"</p>
<p>Hearing my mother-in-law's words, I couldn't help but feel relieved.</p>
<p>Juan's mother opened the suitcase and took out many small clothes and toys. The styles and fabrics of the clothes met Juan's ideals. However, Juan was still a bit confused and asked with a smile, "Mom! Are these all domestic goods? Are they so good?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" Juan's mother replied, "Domestic goods have improved a lot compared to before. Because this year is the Year of the Child and the Year of Domestic Goods, I insisted on buying domestic products. I hope that the nephew who wears these clothes will become a patriotic hero in the future!"</p>
<p>Juan's mother laughed, Juan also laughed, and me? Of course, I'm laughing too!</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods News of the Week</h3>
<p>(1) Since the Ministry of Finance announced the new import tariff regulations, the content is not in line with the principle of protecting tariffs, and domestic products will be greatly affected, causing a great backlash from domestic industrial and commercial circles. In this week, the yarn and cloth industry, silk industry, coal industry, and paper industry in this city have sent telegrams to the government, requesting to withdraw the order. The City Chamber of Commerce, the General Federation of Industry, the General Trade Union, the Machinery Federation, and the cotton industry have also expressed deep regret, but the government has not yet made a formal declaration.</p>
<p>(2) Jiangxi Province plans to build a large-scale machine-made porcelain factory. Since porcelain expert Du Chongyuan personally went to survey the site, the progress has become more specific. The factory will be funded by the Jiangxi Provincial Government with 200,000 yuan and changed to a commercial operation. The Provincial Government will also guarantee the smooth progress of the business without any resistance. It is said that Du Chongyuan will soon go to prepare for it.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Industry recently commissioned He Bingxian to design the expansion of the Nanyang domestic goods market, proceeding in accordance with the four principles set by the Ministry (see the previous issue of this column). It is said that He will soon convene domestic goods manufacturers in this city to discuss the implementation measures.</p>
<p>(4) The alcohol factory planned by the Construction Department of Hunan Province has been determined to be located outside the South Gate of Changsha, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, and will be officially opened in the spring.</p>
<p>(5) Domestic goods manufacturers Feng Yunchu and Cao Zhigong have raised funds to establish a Wuxi domestic goods market. The address has now been determined and construction is underway. Before the opening, an exhibition will be held for three weeks starting on August 15, with a temporary market attached to test the business.</p>
<p>(6) The Jiawang Coal Mine in Xuzhou is the only coal mine in Jiangsu Province. The coal quality is exceptionally good. Since the Huadong Company in this city added a new shaft and completed it, the products will be sold in the market, which will surely add a unique color to domestic coal.</p>
<p>(7) The Northwest Mobile Exhibition Group organized by the China National Products Production and Marketing Cooperation Association has been exhibiting in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang in rotation, with excellent results. The group will soon go to Xi'an for an exhibition. The fourth batch of more than 160 boxes of exhibits in this city has been shipped to the association in recent days.</p>

<h3>There is a Turning Point in the Situation of Grass Tennis. Hope that the Chinese Association will Win Greatly over the North Grass Field. The Result is 14 to 1, the Total Score is 3 Points Less than the French Business Association. The French Business Association Beat the South Grass Field 13 to 2 Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Tennis League, yesterday was the last third week. The Chinese and French Business Associations were tense and ready to fight, each with ambitious aspirations to win the championship. Although the French Business Association lost to the Chinese Association 6 to 9, judging from the points, it had 4 points more than the Chinese Association. Yesterday, the French Business Association beat the South Grass Field 13 to 2, and the Chinese Association beat the North Grass Field 14 to 1. Next week, the Chinese Association will meet the South Grass Field and hopes to win completely. If the French Department meets the North Grass Field, if the scores of both sides are the same as yesterday's results, then the Chinese Association still has great hope. The Chinese Association suffered a great loss in a match against the Japanese Association because Qiu Feihai's game was not finished. Otherwise, the score of the Chinese Association should be above that of the French Business Association. The results of the four matches yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Association Wins Over North Grass Field 14 to 1</p>
<p>French Business Association Wins Over South Grass Field 13 to 2</p>

<h3>Chinese War Situation</h3>
<p>Lineup Changes. The Chinese Association planned to win over the North Grass Field by a score of 15 to 0. The result was 17 to 1, which is also gratifying. However, Zheng Zhaojia was injured in the calf due to swimming and is currently recuperating in the hospital. Liang Deguang was injured in the hand, and Sun Linfang had diarrhea, and neither of them played. Therefore, the lineup was greatly adjusted. Yu Tianguang and Wang Wenzheng, the champions of the open doubles of the Chinese Tennis Association, served as the first group. Lin Baohua and Cheng Yize served as the third group. Qiu Feihai originally faced Liang Deguang in the first group. Because Liang was late, the veteran Tao Tingyao was temporarily pulled in to play. As a result, all five groups won, and except for the loss of one set in the fifth group, all the others won all three sets.</p>
<p>Yu Wang Lianluo. The North Grass Field is full of old and weak people. The secretary of the Grass Tennis Association, Stoke, is already a leader in this field. The rest are Forbes. Aside from these two, it is plain. The first group of the Chinese Association, Wang Yu, combined very well. It was no accident that they previously defeated Bonnie, Fekaelsen, and Defu Xu Chengji. Yesterday, they played casually and won very easily.</p>
<p>Lin Cheng Xian Bi. The third group was relegated by Lin Baohua and Cheng Yize. Lin was resourceful and handy. Cheng Zhen was calm in battle and had no temper. Chopping and lobbing are his best skills. As a result of the three sets, Lin Cheng only lost six games, making them the best performing group among the five and the first to finish. Only Lost One Point. In the second group, Hou Liang Deguang did not arrive, so Tao Tingyao and Qiu were temporarily paired up. The game was delayed for about a quarter of an hour, so it ended the latest. The fourth group, Zhang Dingzhao and Chen Chuanzhang, had excellent patience, so they won completely. The fifth group, Tu Kaiyuan and Shen Baigui, unfortunately lost the first set 4 to 6, thus losing this only point.</p>
<p>Results of Each Group</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang Wang Wenzheng (6 to 4 6 to 3 6 to 2) Stoke Palate 3 to 0</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Tao Tingyao (6 to 4 6 to 4 6 to 1) Forbes Nash 3 to 0</p>

<p>The grip, although as simple as learning ABC, is extremely important. Don't just pick up a racket and hit the ball casually until you are familiar with all aspects of the grip. Because if you use a bad method the first time you grip the racket, this mistake will affect every subsequent shot and will easily become a fixed habit. The more times you hit the ball, the harder it will be to correct.</p>
<p>First, grip the racket at the end of the handle, not in the middle of the handle or slightly above the end. At first, this may seem a little difficult, because it is certainly not as easy for beginners to hit the ball with the longest part of the racket handle as it is to hit it with the shorter part. But this is the most important part of good tennis skills, and soon it will definitely feel easy.</p>
<p>Usually, beginners think that they should hold the racket tightly in their hands and hit the ball hard when they see it. He always thinks that he uses a strong and hard wrist and arm to grip the racket, and that he hits the ball with full force to make the ball fly quickly. In fact, this kind of power is rarely needed, because the correct shot is a light, flexible and rhythmic swing that relies on the power of the racket and the small strength of the player's arm.</p>
<p>Hold the end of the racket handle, slowly swing the racket backwards before hitting, and then swing forward quickly like a pendulum to meet the incoming ball. If you hold the end of the racket handle, the power of the shot will naturally increase greatly, and the arm, wrist, and racket will move like a whip, so the power will be strong when the racket hits the ball.</p>
<p>Recently, the last volume of the American tennis series, called "Method and Players," collected opinions from famous tennis players around the world on the grip method. Their common point is that they all agree with holding the end of the racket and absolutely agree with holding it tightly. This is very clear evidence.</p>
<p>Some players advocate relaxing the hand slightly when hitting, but this method is enough to damage the ball skills, which is more harmful than any other mistakes, because the necessary condition for implementing this hitting method is a player with superior skills, and also requires special skills. Make sure that the incoming ball hits the center of the racket, so that you can slightly relax your hand. As for the other ninety-nine percent of the players, it is difficult to do. Therefore, holding the end of the racket and gripping the handle tightly is the golden rule for the success of beginners' ball skills.</p>
<p>There are many ways to change the angle between the racket face and the hand. Tilden once taught people a best and easiest-to-understand rule for learning the "forehand stroke" Fｏｒｅｈａｎｄｓｔｏｒｋｅ used to meet the incoming ball on the right. At this time, for the grip method, beginners should best place the racket horizontally and vertically on the edge of the table with the racket handle facing themselves, and then shake hands with the back handle, just like shaking hands with a friend.</p>
<p>There is another rule for the correct angle of the racket face to the hand, that is, when the hand is wrapped around the racket handle, the fingertips should face the same direction as the racket strings where the ball is to be hit, and the tiger's mouth between the thumb and index finger should also be exactly on top of the racket handle.</p>
<p>When hitting, the grip should be very natural, and the bending should be very convenient. The wrist is the pivot for forward and backward bending, and it is also the pivot often used when hitting, so the grip must always allow the wrist to have great freedom. Some grips require locking the wrist, and if so, this grip will restrict the freedom of hitting.</p>

<h3>To Solve the Difficulty of Taking Entrance Exams, Read "Guidance for Taking University and Middle School Entrance Exams"; Special Offer for Readers, Discounted by Half</h3>
<p>Recently, the joint entrance examinations in various provinces and cities have ended, and the difficulty of taking entrance exams, which is a double burden for those pursuing further education, is pressing. It is known that the number of places in famous schools is limited, and the number of candidates is large, so the entrance exams will inevitably become more difficult and stricter. Candidates must be fully prepared in order to be confident of admission. During the preparation period for the entrance exams, it is especially important to purchase and read guidance books written by famous experts. First, understand the content of the school you are applying to and the procedures for the exam, and then prepare step by step to avoid panic in the examination hall and failure. Mr. Lu Shaoji, the director of the Normal Department of Shanghai Provincial Middle School, drawing on his usual educational experience, has written two books, "Guidance for Taking University Entrance Exams" and "Guidance for Taking Middle School Entrance Exams," to solve the general difficulties in pursuing further education. Mr. Cai Yuanpei praised them as "thoroughly collected, clearly narrated, and truly worthy of guiding those aspiring to further education." The value of these books is evident. The two books are tailored to the level of university and middle school students, providing guidance on further education for young people, general higher and secondary education regulations, the organization of universities and middle schools, all preparations before taking the exam, how to deal with the entrance exam, preparations after admission, and the status of universities and middle schools. All questions are described and guided in chapters and sections, thoroughly solving all the difficulties in university and middle school entrance exams. They are truly the only saviour for entrance exams. All those who are pursuing further education and taking entrance exams should purchase and read them during this period of preparation for the entrance exams in order to be admitted. Each book is a thick paperback, published by the Qin Fen Book Company at 392 Laoshifu Road in this city. The price is six dimes per book, but to offer readers a special discount, the price is only three dimes. For out-of-town mail orders, please add 13 cents for registered postage.

<h3>Wuben Girls' High School Plans Strict Discipline and Control; Over a Thousand People Request Expansion of Enrollment</h3>
<p>Since Ms. Yan Zhenyu took over as principal of the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School last winter, she has been determined to improve the school's operations. The number of applicants for the first new student enrollment this year was more than 700, which is unprecedented in previous years. However, since the enrollment quota for both junior and senior high school is only a few dozen students, the number of letters and telegrams from families requesting an expansion of the enrollment has reached more than 1,000, which shows the deep faith of the community in the school. It is recently learned that the school has submitted a request to the Education Bureau to add classes. In addition to raising the curriculum and paying attention to extracurricular activities from the next semester, the school will also advocate absolute strictness in terms of discipline and control. In order to understand the personality of students and facilitate communication, the school has explained the purpose and methods of strict discipline and control in a letter to the parents of students, and has attached a guarantee letter and a paper for parents' signatures. These will be sent out separately within a few days. It is also learned that the teachers newly hired by the school for the next semester are all experts with rich knowledge and experience. In the past, due to the issue of teachers or the historical relationship of the school, there may have been places that were not ideal or up to standard. From the next semester onwards, all of these will be thoroughly reformed. Attached below is the school's letter to the parents of students:</p>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>It has been more than half a year since Zhenyu took over as principal of Wuben. Under the supervision of the authorities and with the assistance of colleagues, I have been cautious and fortunate enough to avoid making mistakes. However, the situations of various schools vary greatly, and each school must have its strengths and weaknesses. Although Wuben is a well-known girls' school in our country, when measured against the ideal standard of running a school, there are many places that are not satisfactory. Now that the current academic year is coming to an end, we plan to rectify it from the next semester onwards. In addition to re-planning and improving various school facilities, we will also implement strict physical and mental training to cultivate honest, brave, hardworking, and thrifty habits and a strict and disciplined life. In order to achieve the above goals, we will implement Boy Scout training for all junior high school students and New Life Movement training for senior high school students. We also plan to establish close ties with parents to achieve twice the result with half the effort. We have always admired your parents' deep concern for our school. We trust that you will agree with this improvement. For the sake of strict discipline and control, all students, both new and old, must fill out and stamp a guarantee letter and a signature paper separately. We have enclosed a blank guarantee letter and a signature paper for your review and completion. Please mail them back to the school by registered mail before the end of July, along with the attached reply letter. If we do not receive a reply by the deadline, the school will cancel the student's enrollment and recruit new students to fill the vacancy. We have also attached a copy of the points to note for the next semester for your reference.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

Student Fees: Tuition and boarding fees are waived. All other fees payable are the same as those for ordinary junior high school classes.</p>
<p>11. Faculty and Staff: One director will be appointed. Teachers will be appointed by the teachers of this school. A number of technicians may be hired on a temporary basis. No administrative or clerical staff will be appointed. All affairs will be managed by the students.</p>
<p>12. Operating Expenses: This class is in its initial stage and is established independently. It is also experimental in nature. In addition to the regular teachers, a number of vocational technicians must also be hired for extracurricular guidance. A relatively large amount of experimental material is also required. Therefore, the operating expenses must be slightly higher than those of ordinary junior high school classes. It should be provided in accordance with the standard of the vocational school with the smallest class size. The first year requires an operating expense of ○ yuan.</p>
<p>13. Equipment: In the first year, 800 yuan must be added for the equipment of ordinary classrooms, dormitories, study rooms, and offices. Special equipment, such as sewing machines, requires the purchase of ten sewing machines at 170 yuan each, totaling 1,700 yuan. New-style stoves and utensils for cooking require 500 yuan. Cement basins and utensils for washing and dyeing require 500 yuan. Various handicraft equipment requires 500 yuan.

Special books and instruments require 500 yuan. The total equipment cost is 5,700 yuan. 15. School Building: The original school's external dormitories, warehouses, and open spaces are too small to be used for gardening and animal husbandry practice, and the floor space of the buildings is also insufficient for the use of three grades of students. It is now proposed to build a large classroom, four small study rooms, a large sewing room, a large cooking room, a large washing and dyeing room, another large workshop, a small tool room, and a small office in the area of the south-central faculty and staff residences in the first year. Except for the dormitory, which does not need to be built separately, it is estimated that five large rooms and seven small rooms need to be built.

<h3>On the Harbin-Changchun Line</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The trains on the Harbin-Changchun line are divided into two types: large-ticket trains and small-ticket trains. Large-ticket trains are divided into first, second, and third class, while small-ticket trains are all fourth class. Large-ticket trains can also be said to be express trains, and naturally, small-ticket trains should be slow trains.</p>
<p>The seating arrangement on large-ticket trains divides the seats into three layers, similar to the sleeper cars on the South Manchuria Railway, except that they are slightly wider. Small-ticket trains are not only slower, but also much smaller in size. What is most special about the Harbin-Changchun trains is that there are no vendors. If passengers do not bring food with them before boarding, they can only wait for the train to stop at a station and go to the small shop on the station to buy food, but there is only one shop at the station, and the prices are very high.</p>
<p>The area through which this route passes is also a large plain with fertile soil and abundant agricultural products, much better than the plains of the South Manchuria Railway. Soybeans are the main agricultural product along the route. Since last year, opium poppies have also appeared on this large plain. Unfortunately, when I passed by on the train, they had all been harvested, otherwise I could have seen what poppy flowers look like.</p>
<p>The station buildings at several small stations have been burned down, leaving only the broken remains standing there. They are martyrs of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The weeds are gradually growing tall, and some vines have climbed onto their broken bodies.</p>
<p>The station buildings on the Harbin-Changchun line all stand with strong and sturdy chests, but they also reveal some clumsiness. Compared with some of the exquisite constructions on the South Manchuria Railway, they represent the completely different characteristics of the two.</p>
<p>There are no barbed wire fences or sandbags installed at the stations, probably because they are not afraid of being ambushed. In fact, the Volunteer Army is not their enemy, so there is no need for defensive structures.</p>
<p>The scenery near Laoshaogou Station is very good, with continuous mountain ranges and the train winding its way up. In the blink of an eye, the world is completely transformed. The Songhua River Railway Bridge can be said to be a major project on this route. The mountains and rivers reflect each other here, making it a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Young girls with yellow hair and blue eyes can be seen in almost every office at every station. Sometimes they are smiling and jumping on the platform. They are the new women of the era, and they have all come to serve in society.</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled on this train must remember a uniquely built station, which is Shuangchengbao. Not only is the form of this station building special, but the materials used are also different from those of other station buildings. In short, it is built too well, even surpassing the Harbin Station.</p>
<p>Small-ticket trains are always crowded, and the passengers are mostly the working masses and ordinary citizens. The fare is four or five yuan cheaper than large-ticket trains. But large-ticket trains are also crowded. Every day, each type of train runs once in both directions from Changchun and Harbin, which is probably the reason for the crowded passengers.</p>
<p>Sanchahe is a large station with many grain depots on both sides. This is where grain is collected. In winter, grain carts are often crowded in long strings. Next to the station building, it is said that Japanese soldiers also dropped several bombs before attacking Harbin.</p>
<p>There is a very suitable facility for poor passengers on the Harbin-Changchun line, which is that there are no hot water tanks at any station. After the train stops, passengers can get water freely without paying a penny, especially in the summer, when people who cannot afford to buy soda still need hot water.</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists are now trying to force the purchase of this route. Let's wait and see what happens next.</p>
<h3>The World of Cicadas</h3>
<p>— Deng Dangshi</p>
<p>Chinese scholars mostly believe that all knowledge must come from sages or at least from the mouths of scholars. Even the invention and application of fire and herbal medicines are not related to the people but are entirely the work of ancient sage kings, such as Suirenshi and Shennongshi. Therefore, some people think that it is not surprising that "all knowledge comes from the mouths of animals."</p>
<p>Moreover, the knowledge that "comes from the mouths of animals" is often not true knowledge in China. The weather is terribly hot, and the windows and doors are all open. People with radios all broadcast the sound waves into the streets to "share the fun with the people." They sing and sing in a drawn-out, high-pitched voice. I don't know about foreign countries, but in China, there is singing from morning till night. It is sometimes sharp and sometimes hoarse. As long as you want, it can simply keep your ears from being quiet for a moment. At the same time, they turn on the fans and eat ice cream, which is not only unrelated to the places where "water levels are rising sharply" and "drought conditions have formed," but also completely different worlds from the places where people are covered in oily sweat and struggling to survive all day long outside the window.</p>
<p>While listening to the drawn-out, high-pitched singing, I suddenly remembered the famous fable by the French poet La Fontaine, "The Cicada and the Ant." It was also summer with such a fiery sun. The ant was working hard on the ground, while the cicada was singing loudly on the branch and laughing at the ant's vulgarity. However, when the autumn wind came, and it was getting colder day by day, the cicada had no clothes and no food and became a little pauper, but it was taught a lesson by the ant, who had made preparations early. This is what the teacher told me when I was "receiving education" in elementary school. I seemed to be very moved, and I still remember it sometimes.</p>
<p>However, although I remember it, due to the lesson of "unemployment upon graduation," my opinion is very different from that of the ant. The autumn wind will come soon, and it will naturally get colder day by day. However, those who have no clothes and no food at that time are probably the people who are now covered in oily sweat. The surroundings of the Western-style houses are certainly quiet, but that is because the windows and doors are tightly closed, and even the sound waves are kept in with the warmth of the stove. I imagine that it is probably still drawn-out singing, "Thank you, drizzle."</p>
<p>Isn't the knowledge that "comes from the mouths of animals" often inapplicable in China?</p>
<p>&lt;ctrl100&gt;China has its own sages and scholars. "Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by others are fed (going tone) by others; those who govern others are fed by others," is said very simply and clearly. If the teacher had taught me this earlier, I would not have had those thoughts above and wasted so much paper and ink. This is also a good piece of evidence that Chinese people must read Chinese ancient books.</p>
<h3>New Silk</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Mr. Da Er Ye - This Ends It -</h3>
<p>— Yu Yangling</p>
<p>Mr. Er Ye discussed with me Jin Shengtan's commentary on the Water Margin. He started by labeling me "a student privately influenced by Jin Shengtan," leaving me no room for argument. Therefore, I don't want to say much, just a few words to conclude the matter.</p>
<p>First, what does Mr. Er Ye mean by "the consciousness of the noble group"? Does it refer to all consciousness possessed by the noble group? Or does it refer to the consciousness of the noble group in support of their own group? If it is the former, then there is no way to discuss it. Among the noble group, some want to maintain their own group, while others want to rebel against their own group. This consciousness is truly inexplicable. Then it's not just Jin Shengtan, but feudal landlord Tolstoy and bourgeois Zola all become worthless people, even though they criticize their own class, they are still part of the "noble group"! However, such arguments become meaningless.</p>
<p>If "the consciousness of the noble group" refers to the consciousness of supporting the noble group, then Jin Shengtan did not have such consciousness. The seventy-fourth chapter of Water Margin is clearly a work that "teaches robbery."</p>
<p>This leads to the second question: how should Jin Shengtan's criticism of Song Jiang be interpreted? I said, "He wrote Song Jiang, who hoped for amnesty, as very loyal and righteous in the story, but ridiculed him as worthless." Mr. Er Ye suspects that I "read another version of Jin's commentary on Water Margin." He believes that Jin ridiculed "Song Jiang who is very falsely loyal and righteous, pretending to accept amnesty but actually willing to be a bandit." Regarding this, Mr. Er Ye should really read "another Water Margin," namely the one hundred and twenty chapter version. In the one hundred and twenty chapter version, Song Jiang is completely written as very loyal and righteous. Saying that Song Jiang's loyalty and righteousness is false is actually Jin Shengtan's intention. Why did Jin Shengtan criticize Song Jiang, who was very loyal and righteous in the story, as false? It is very clear that Jin Shengtan was against accepting amnesty. He approved of true bandits like Li Kui and was dissatisfied with Song Jiang's ambiguous attitude towards the ruling class, so he deliberately wrote Song Jiang as false to make readers hate him. This was not enough, so he simply deleted the second half of the story, which implemented surrender. This intention is not difficult to see if one is only slightly careful.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the seventy-chapter version of Water Margin is a novel that "teaches robbery." Jin Shengtan, who belonged to the noble group at the time, could not succeed in the noble group, so he was inspired to have a consciousness against the noble group and intentionally teach robbery. Therefore, his consciousness can no longer be said to be the consciousness of the noble group. This is my conclusion.</p>
<p>As for the "court," that is limited to the time of Jin Shengtan. Comparing Leopard Head Lin Chong to "a person without father or ruler" seems to be scolding bandits, but it is actually not the case. I don't want to explain this reason clearly. If Mr. Er Ye has time, he should read the seventy-chapter Water Margin again and see who Jin Shengtan sympathizes with more: Song Jiang, who has a father and a ruler, or Li Kui, who has neither. He will surely see many reasons.</p>
<h3>In the Mist</h3>
<p>— Sha Ming</p>
<p>The streets at dusk are so quiet; the white roses in the garden at the end of May quietly emit a faint fragrance; people in the deep alleys drag their lazy steps; a layer of gray smoke in the sky presses on the treetops again, and the holly trees gradually become dim.</p>
<p>Here—</p>
<p>The dim streetlights penetrate into the woods.</p>
<p>The child is running home on the winding ridges, looking at the mother leaning against the door from the hazy atmosphere, and that pale face becomes more and more blurred...</p>
<p>How anxious the young heart is! The caress takes away the melancholy mood, revealing a victorious smile in front of the crystal clear lights.</p>
<p>A detailed story is better than intimate whispers; so the child concentrates on the mother's words. However, the thick smoke is filled, steaming, flowing in from the window and gradually occupying a corner of the room; but this murmuring sound continues without the slightest weariness. That night, the child dreams of blue flowers, sparkling brilliantly in the mother's temples...</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the dream.</p>
<h3>A Wall (II)</h3>
<p>— Original by Roberto Bracco, translated by Xi Dichhen</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I didn't get it."</p>
<p>"Then what to do?"</p>
<p>"Be a little more patient and you will fall asleep."</p>
<p>The two of them, taking turns speaking and listening, first pressed their mouths against the wall, and then put their ears to the wall; both made gestures, as if they thought they could take turns seeing each other. They continued to talk.</p>
<p>"Good woman, it's no use for me to be patient. Since you want to know, I'll tell you. I don't want to sleep, I want to work. I have to work."</p>
<p>"Then what's stopping you?"</p>
<p>"It's the sound of your sewing machine. My thoughts are scattered and my head is dizzy. I can't even see the paper in front of my eyes clearly. Usually, I'm used to working hard, even if it's noisy all around, I can still write, but on this cursed night, the sound of your sewing machine is making me upset and driving me crazy."</p>
<p>"Then write in the morning, sir, and I'll be done in the morning."</p>
<p>"You wait until morning to finish it."</p>
<p>"I've already told you, I can't wait."</p>
<p>"I can't wait either."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, find a way to work in another room."</p>
<p>"Just like you, I only have one room. I come in and out from the balcony. If I work outdoors, I'll die. My health is very bad."</p>
<p>"Poor man, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"Ah, if you're sorry, you won't help me."</p>
<p>"Please forgive me, sir. If you knew..."</p>
<p>"Knew what?"</p>
<p>"What I have to sew must be finished within an hour – otherwise..."</p>

<h3>Records of the Lingering Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Otherwise, regardless of whether the Manchu Qing government falls or not, the external benefits and internal chaos suffered by China will always be better than they are now!</p>
<p>His traveling clothes were of course different from those of the accompanying ministers... His arrow robe was made of sky-blue satin, embroidered with countless longevity characters in gold thread; the size of this robe suited his figure very well, fitting perfectly, coupled with his delicate face, he could really be considered a handsome young man. Outside this arrow robe, he also wore a sleeveless vest, also made of satin, but black, and embroidered with many longevity characters in gold thread; but in my opinion, this vest was really superfluous, and two long blue sleeves stretched out from the outside of this black vest, which could be said to be extremely ugly.</p>
<p>In general, rich people, both men and women, mostly love to use gold, silver, and jewelry decorations, but Guangxu absolutely hates these things; the formation of his strange temper is of course mostly influenced by the adverse environment and various unintentional encounters, as long as those who are slightly sensible can estimate it. But there were never any special ancestral instructions stipulating how much gold, silver, and jewelry the emperor of each dynasty should use, and it was only based on each person's own preferences, so no one could interfere with why Guangxu didn't use these things! But on the black satin melon-skin cap that he wore, there was a pearl the size of a longan attached, and the position was just above his brow center; this pearl was not only large, but also crystal clear and clean, different from ordinary products, inlaid on this black cap, it was even more sparkling and moving. However, Guangxu's use of this pearl was definitely not for the sake of looking good, but contained a kind of commemorative effect. In his usual expression, it is not difficult to find his intention; but who he is really commemorating, that cannot be asserted. On the top of his hat, there was also a knot made of red silk thread, and a tassel of red silk about a foot long, all of which were very bright and eye-catching. (81)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Scorching Weather</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The shadow of the ice flag flies in the hot wind, dancing upside down on the asphalt road that melts like festering sores. The wheels are run over by people with bare feet. People in the car feel a kind of visual desire. Seeing the sun so white, and there are no silk shirts fluttering in the shade of the plane trees, their own flesh feels like it has been soaked in boiling water. A burst of sweat secreted from the skin is sticky and uncomfortable! So they jump out of the car and stride into the ice room. The rickshaw driver stands outside the door waiting! If only they had a pair of shorts and a pair of slippers, and took a nap in the cool shade of green banana trees, watching a spider slowly hang down a silver thread, and the spider would follow the wind and waves, blowing to the other corner of the eaves, and then blowing to the willow branches, always back and forth, weaving its exquisite silk palace, and the unrestrained posture of floating in space is so leisurely and so free!</p>
<p>Cangpu and Qing Ai were cut down around the Dragon Boat Festival. Now both banks are full of purple mud. When the tide recedes in the morning, the banks are covered with turtles and shrimps, squatting motionless, and the willow shade is covering them. The willow branches are noisy with hot cicadas, distant and near; the sounds are very harmonious; when the near-sounding songs rest, the distant ones continue to sing. If at this time, there is a fishing boat, beating the oars urgently, and the fisherman sings a folk song while rowing closer, the cicada sounds will immediately stop leisurely, and the turtles and shrimps on land will also move their bodies. The turtles slowly walk into the water, but the shrimps jump into the water.</p>
<p>The children in the countryside are naked, with bare legs, and their bodies are covered with sores. The ancient capitals apply white coarse powder, but they don't feel the heat, and they are even happier because of the heat, just as the hot summer is of the same interest to them - they go to chase butterflies among the flowers, to watch fishermen catching shrimps in the river, and to pick up shells in the graveyard. Sweat is flowing, and their mouths are full of hot air, but they are happy.</p>
<p>The city is in a vortex of heat, and the countryside is also in a vortex of heat. But the women in the countryside, while the urban ladies are drinking ice water and telling red dreams to their lovers, "they all rush to the fields to cut grass and weeds." Don't you see the silver sun covering the entire round hats they wear?</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Psychology Within Two Minutes</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>A streetcar was evenly and neatly filled with people, heading east. At Met He Tongtu Road, a woman from a certain country came up, holding a child with a bandage on his head in her right hand. Under normal circumstances, when a woman gets on the bus, I usually stand up and give her a seat, but on this day, as long as I squeezed a little, there would be enough room for a person to sit, especially since she was holding a sick child.</p>
<p>But it wasn't so. When I saw this woman, I inherently didn't want to give her a seat, and a compatriot sitting next to me had the same psychology as me. He even deliberately separated his feet a little to directly express his refusal. At the same time, in my mind, the scene of Zhuo Jun of Johns Hopkins University, who was sued by an unreasonable Western woman for giving up a seat, which was published in the newspaper not long ago, was reflected. At this time, driven by nationalistic feelings, I and my seat became even more closely connected.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, the bus was about to reach Carter Road. There were two connecting curves on this section of the track, and the car body vibrated violently. It was also pitiful that the woman without a seat, because of her inherently inherited shortness, couldn't reach the shaking rattan ring on the car. If I hadn't pulled her, she might have dragged her child and rushed out of the car. At this time, my nationalistic animosity turned into human sympathy, and I stood up very readily and let her sit down.</p>
<p>In essence, this woman and I have no hatred at all. It is only because their ambitious warlords have oppressed our country that they have obscured the beauty of human nature - sympathy. This is an extremely small example, at most it would only make this woman and child fall.</p>
<h3>Where to Go?</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<h3>Biography of Mrs. Zhao</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao is a typical Chinese wife. She is over fifty years old this year, and her hair is half white. Her legs are as thin as pens. The cotton wadding in the toe of her shoes must fill at least one-third of the entire shoe, so when she walks, she jumps like a little chicken, which is quite funny.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao likes to dress up. Every time she goes out, the time spent dressing up takes a full one or two hours. It is a major task to painfully pluck out the gray and white short hairs in front of the mirror and dye her hair strands, which are neither long nor short, black with black coal. She also often applies some hair growth oil and black hair lotion, and sighs at the hundreds of tested and effective Eastern goods, but unfortunately they are no longer available now.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao likes rayon silk and colorful foreign cloth. It is said that this is because the price is cheap, and because the color is bright and can reduce her age. Mrs. Zhao doesn't eat much, but her ability to eat snacks is really not small. When buying, she is really "fierce", if she can deduct a copper coin, she will endure the seller's bitter pleas, and even cold ridicule, she doesn't care; or say a sentence "I will make up for it next time", and that's it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao thinks that she is very kind to the maids and servants, but if they accidentally offend her, she will always scold them for an hour or two, or even scold them until they are weeping. Mrs. Zhao thinks that she is willing to do good deeds, but if the rickshaw driver begs her to add a copper coin, she will "raise her willow eyebrows upside down".</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao believes in asking for fortune telling, and especially likes to associate with nuns and witches. Although Mrs. Zhao is illiterate, she has never made a mistake when playing mahjong. Mrs. Zhao loves to talk to young men, although her heart is very pure. Mrs. Zhao likes to listen to romantic stories, probably because her husband is busy smoking opium.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhao has many more virtuous deeds, which cannot be fully described at once. In short, she is a typical Chinese wife.</p>

<h3>Talking About Tropical Fish (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>(X) Heterandria Formosa, produced in the pond edges of North Carolina and Florida, is only one and three-quarters of an inch long, with dark thick stripes from head to tail and black spots on the back. Its habits are the same as those of the topminnow. (XI) Jordanella Floridae, produced in the streams of Florida, is shaped like a small crucian carp, with a green body covered with black spots, and the male fish has red spots, and the scales are shaped like crane feathers. (XII) Chanchito, produced in Brazil, has five vertical stripes arranged from back to abdomen, also known as the flower pig fish, shaped like a yellow croaker, but only two or three inches long. The habits of this fish are like those of a pig, it likes to make noise, and its different characteristics from other fish are that it does not devour its own eggs. (XIII) Scalare, also known as Half-moon, produced in the Amazon River and South American streams, its posture is very beautiful, the body is like a flat fish, the dorsal fin and pectoral fin are triangular, with beautiful stripes, the pectoral fin has two gray-white long lines, growing in water temperatures above sixty-five degrees. (XIV) Red-Chromlde, the body is red, and some are brownish-green, the throat is bright red, and the whole body is covered with spots. The root of the caudal fin and the edge of the gills have three large black spots. The color is bright and similar to gemstones. It can live in water temperatures around sixty degrees. (XV) Black Banded Chromide, produced in Brazil, has the same habits as the gemstone fish, the whole body is black-brown stripes, only the pectoral fin is red. (XVI) Mouth Breeder, produced in Egypt, Africa, is shaped like a small crucian carp, the largest is only two inches, can incubate eggs in the mouth, the whole body has golden yellow and blue luster, the pelvic fin is red, can live in water temperatures around sixty-eight degrees. (XVII) Pyrrhulina, also produced in South America, is shaped like a mouth-brooding fish, but the color is slightly inferior. When the female fish lays eggs, it leaps out of the water and lays eggs on the shore. (XVIII) Paradise fish, produced in Southeast Asia and Africa, is flat, the fins are very developed, the ends of the fins are like loose silk, the whole body is brown, with several straight stripes, interspersed with red vertical blue and other colors, living in high temperatures of around fifty degrees to ninety degrees. (XIX) Grouami, produced in India and the Mara Islands, is only one inch and four-fifths of an inch long, the body has orange-yellow and blue stripes, and some have red and blue stripes, and can croak like a frog. (XX) Fighting Fish, produced in Siam, is aggressive in character, the body is similar to the paradise fish but flat, the pectoral fins are very large, the tail is radial lines, with red, green, purple gauze and other colors. Siam uses this fish to gamble on winning and losing, and levies a high export tax. There is also the Climbing perch that can jump on the shore and climb trees. The Walking fish can jump to the seaside and walk on the sand with its armored pectoral fins. Butterflyfish has very developed pectoral fins, similar to butterflies, and often flies out of the water, so it is also called flying fish. There are many other species, due to space limitations, they cannot be listed.</p>
<p>(II) Rearing Method The method of raising tropical fish is the same as that of raising goldfish, but for fish with special habits, a wire mesh must be covered on the fish pond to prevent them from jumping out. As for the water temperature, it should be kept above sixty degrees, but from early summer to early autumn, it can be left to nature. After early winter, there must be special greenhouse equipment. Ordinary use of charcoal fire and coal stove is also possible, or the use of electric heating and hot water radiators is even more suitable, but a water temperature meter must be used to measure the height of the water temperature. Feeding food is the same as goldfish, such as mosquito larvae, red worms, shellfish, silkworm pupae, noodles, egg yolk powder, etc., but these ornamental fish, which were first caught from rivers, are not very accustomed to living in small fish tanks, and wide fish troughs should be built to allow them to swim freely.</p>
<h3>Four Battalion Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty-One Three Fights, White-Clad Men Charge the Cloud Formation, the Entire Battalion Dies for the Country, Red Eyes Enter the Gun Forest</p>
<p>Just panicking? In the smoke, I saw Tian Qing supervising four brothers, rushing to carry a machine gun over, set it up on the collapsed slope, and fired at the enemy. Bububu, a burst of strafing, the charging enemies, like dominoes, fell to the ground in a series. Zi Qiang recovered his breath, and saw that the bunker was lying in disorder, all dead soldiers. There were no more than two hundred people holding guns and guarding the bunker. Fortunately, the attacking and defending armies are now in close contact. Those two disturbing planes, fearing that the bombs would injure their own people, have already flown away, and the two sides are still in a state of confrontation between infantry. However, although the people who originally planned to charge have stopped, they believe that this gap cannot be relaxed. Relying on their sophisticated equipment, they already have three machine guns shooting at this gap. Zi Qiang also stared at the bottom of the city. He accidentally turned his head and saw Tian Qing upside down, lying on the slope. He blurted out and couldn't help but shout Battalion Commander Tian. He suddenly jumped, jumped into the bunker, his body fell down again, opened his eyes and said, Old Zhao, tell me, are there any good people in our Northeast? Tell me! Zi Qiang had already held him in both hands, freed one hand, stretched out his thumb and said, There are good people! Tian Qing slightly opened his eyes, nodded, and said goodbye to Old Zhao with a smile. Zi Qiang's grief at this time need not be said. He held Tian Qing's loyal body for a long time and could not make a sound. Suddenly he heard Bao Fang shouting The west gate is firing, let's go take a look. Zi Qiang put down Tian Qing and looked back. Bao Fang was gritting his teeth, and his eyes were red and big, which made people a little scared. He looked at the bunker twice, saw that there were still a hundred or so brothers, and jumped down into the bunker, and at the same time said to the trumpeter beside him Blow the assembly number! The trumpeter blew the number several times in a row, and those brothers on the castle all ran to the open space of the bombed-out house foundation with their guns and stood there. (432)</p>

<h3>Financial Market: Gold Market Sentiment Listless, Declining by 3.20 Yuan; Silver Prices Fail to Rise, Market Still Stable; Exchange Rate Loosens, Breaking the 90 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Following consecutive days of rising gold prices, the market yesterday showed signs of fatigue. This was mainly due to banks continuing to sell off, buyers becoming satisfied, and the exchange rate hardening, leading to a decline. The morning session initially held steady before weakening, eventually hovering around 90 yuan, ultimately ending softer. At the start of the day, overseas silver markets in England and the United States both declined. The forward silver price on the precious metals exchange rose nearly 4 hao, retracting 1.5 fen (the May futures price was mistakenly reported as 100 pounds lower yesterday; otherwise, the May futures price would have risen 8.5 li today). Exchange rates rose slightly, London spot gold rose 1 penny, US cotton rose 21 pounds, US wheat rose 1.25 fen, and stocks rose 1.03 yuan. Overnight, expectations of rising silver prices did not materialize. Raw material trading opened at 92.3 yuan. Initial trading opened flat. Reports indicated that the US government denied that Harrison was discussing gold parity in Europe. Silver proponents attacked him as the most dangerous element in monetary stability, which had little impact. However, banks immediately sold off upon entering the market. US dollar dealers were satisfied with their purchases. The exchange rate loosened. Spot goods also arrived at port. The entire market gradually declined, but remained stable for a time. Later, the domestic market hardened further, breaking the 90 yuan mark. Subsequently, banks' appetite shifted from aggressive selling to more moderate selling. As the gold market trended lower, buyers emerged, causing prices to fluctuate. Buying and selling sentiment was balanced, leading to prolonged contention around the 90 yuan mark. However, substantial supply from the Tianjin banking group led to a weakening of the market. The Seattle night market silver price report showed a decline of 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.125, slightly rebounding, but the midday close still succumbed to within the 90 yuan level. Midday sentiment turned slightly weaker, and the gold market struggled to rally. The red gold price was 1001 yuan. Tianjin goods were priced 10 yuan higher, while Eastern goods were priced 9 yuan higher. The midday market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 992.5 yuan, a rise of 0.2 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 2.2 yuan. Exchange rates opened with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 15625, and US exchange at 33.9375 yuan. McCallie sold August US dollars at 34.0625 yuan. Dinkin, Fu Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, and others all sold, causing a drop to 0.3 yuan. Hong Xing, Dinkin, and Hui Xiang bought low, raising the price to 1.1 yuan. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, and Ying Feng Heng continued to sell. Mitsui sold September US dollars at 1875, lowering it to 0.3 yuan. It was anticipated that HSBC would quote British and US exchanges flat. Wan Xing and Shun Mao submitted orders. Although it once rose to 1 yuan, the exchange rate hardened. Citibank released August US dollars at 125. Heng Xing Yuan, Fu Xing Yong, Yong Li, and Da De Cheng sold again, down to 89.6 yuan. Heng Yu, Yu Qing Yong, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Ri Chang, and Cui Tai bought low, rebounding to 90.07 yuan. After entering the market, Shen Kang also bought, but Sassoon aggressively sold shillings. Yu Qing Yong, Yuan Chang Yong, and Yong Li sold off one after another, causing a drop to 89.2 yuan. Joseon bought October US dollars at 375. Wah Bi ate November's half yuan. Qian Chang Xiang, Yong Li, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Heng Tai, and others bought one after another, pushing the price up to 90.03 yuan. Yu Qing Yong and Fu Yu were relentless in their selling. Banks also sold August US dollars at 125, causing a drop to 89.1 yuan. Bing Xing entered the market steadily. Yuan Mao Yong worked hard to buy. Ying Feng Heng and Liang Xing also bought, raising the price to 90 yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, Heng Yu, and others successively supplied orders, but the market situation remained fatigued, retreating to 89 yuan.

<h3>Silver and Cash Market Trading Listless</h3>

<h3>Sales of Jiangsu and Guangdong Coins Stagnant and Listless</h3>
<p>The market situation for auxiliary coinage yesterday was characterized by weak sales and a failure of prices to rise. Jiangsu small silver coins opened in the morning at 832 yuan, down 5 yuan from the previous session. Although they rebounded by 3.5 yuan in the afternoon to 835.5 yuan, they were still down 1.5 yuan from the previous day.

<h3>Securities and Government Bonds Sold Off by Northern Banks</h3>
<p>96 Bonds Initially Rose, Then Plummeted, Still Up Half a Yuan; Political Rumors Caused Turbulence, Continuing to Fall by Over a Yuan.</p>
<p>At the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange yesterday, market prices fluctuated, tending to hover, due to expanded trading, resulting in larger price swings. Based on observations of major buyers and sellers in the market, buyers were very strong, and a large-scale collapse was unlikely, with the market likely to hover. Buyers like numbers 4, 11, and 41 were powerful players. Most of the sellers were northern banks, with the rest being retail investors. Speculators have been selling in recent days, and if the environment does not change, the trend is likely to move higher. Although 96 Bonds were once suppressed and plummeted to the limit on the previous day, the trend rebounded due to strong buying interest. The rumors of 96 Bond consolidation have circulated for years, but the government's financial resources were insufficient, resulting in only intention to consolidate without concrete measures. Therefore, many had profited from the outcome. The sudden surge and collapse were abnormal, and the large fluctuations in various bonds were also affected by the rise and fall of 96 Bonds. Given the Ministry of Finance's strict scrutiny of savings departments in various banks, even if the financial community did not buy, it was certain that they could not sell, so there was no need to be pessimistic about the future. In yesterday's morning session, continuing the rebound from the previous day, various bonds listed slightly declined by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. From the 20 series onward, instead of shrinking the current month due to high futures prices, they rose by 0.65 yuan, and market sentiment turned enthusiastic. Number 4 was the most aggressive buyer, and the Consolidated Tax Bonds surged by 1 yuan. In the afternoon session, political rumors caused turbulence, and market prices returned by a small number of corners to over 1 yuan, while 96 Bonds rose by about half a yuan. The final market prices declined by a small number of corners to 1.3 to 1.4 yuan, with Consolidated Tax Bonds still up 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and 96 Bonds also up about half a yuan. The 20 series near-term rose by 0.6 yuan, and the total transaction volume was approximately 25 million yuan. The price change results are listed in the following comparative table (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that New York stock market trading was slightly quiet yesterday (the 10th), with prices trending upward. This was due to encouraging commercial news, such as the increased production of United States Steel Corporation and automobiles, as well as increased transportation of bulk grains increasing railway business. Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Corporation announced the cancellation of common stock dividends to retain its cash, but the market sentiment was good, so there was no adverse impact. Holmes Stock Gold Mine rose to 425 yuan. The small exchange market situation also trended higher. The bond market was mixed, with the feature being the continued strength of US government bonds, with several reaching new highs, as it was widely believed that the US financial position was exceptionally solid. Foreign government bonds rose and fell mixed, with German government bonds being fairly flat. Wheat rose due to poor overseas wheat crop news and increased public interest. Total daily trading was 650,000 shares. The New York agent also reported (securities) that the stock market appeared to have been bought up quite a bit, but the market situation still showed its upward trend (grains). The temperature in the western United States was extremely high, and the heatwave spread quite far. Given the situation, wheat and corn prices should rise (cotton). The market situation rose due to rising prices in Liverpool, the still poor weather in the western United States, and good merchant buying interest. Few were selling in the South (rubber). The market situation was firm, reflecting the main markets. There were very few Eastern sales, and New York and London bought in the same direction. Price increases were often due to long positions being closed. (Sugar) Prices were very flat, and the market was dull and uninteresting. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>|               | July 9 | July 10 | Change |</p>
<p>| ------------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flowers' Actual Demand Difficult to Improve, Yarn Market Attempts to Rise But Stops</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then leveled off. Overseas cotton markets continued to rise, and market sentiment was good. However, various trading groups in the market still lacked purchasing power, actual demand was not smooth, and the market rose and then fell again. However, most buyers still had no intention of releasing their holdings, so the front stage was still level, mostly in the hands of banks and money shops. Short-selling Japanese firms accounted for one-half, so the force of hovering was extremely large.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Yarn Initially Rose Then Returned) The standard yarn market opened, and because overseas cotton continued to rise, the market atmosphere was somewhat tight, and buying interest grew stronger. All months rose 1 to 0.89 yuan. By the 23rd trade, it gradually returned down because of the slow sales of current yarn. As a result, near-term months actually fell 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, and far-term months rose 1.2 yuan. The former market traded 24,400 bales. It was found that Tong Fu sold 400 bales, Tong Ji 600 bales, Sui Long 600 bales, Tai Xing 550 bales, Hui Kang 750 bales, Da Fu 600 bales, Ren Feng 800 bales, and Yuan Yi 750 bales. Xie Cheng sold 550 bales. Da Feng bought 450 bales, Yuan Da 800 bales, Ming De 550 bales, Geng Feng 550 bales, Rui Da 1,100 bales, Yuan De 950 bales, Yi Cheng 750 bales, and Run Kang 1,200 bales.

<p>Inland 145 bales, Ningbo 27 bales, Fujian 5 bales, Shantou 125 bales, Guangdong 145 bales, Changsha 10 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Long Positions Realizing Profits and Emerging</h3>
<p>The cotton market opened in the morning, and the rising trend grew stronger. Because American cotton continued to rise by 25 pounds, buyers took advantage of the momentum to increase their holdings. Therefore, the rising trend was very strong. However, as the market rose high, it was unexpected that long positions would realize profits and emerge in large numbers. The front stage suddenly loosened. Old cotton was flat, and new cotton was firmer due to the drought weather.</p>
<p>(Standard Flowers New Firm Old Flat) The standard cotton market opened, and because American and Indian cotton markets were both trending upward, the buying interest in the market was strong. However, old cotton was still flat, and the rising trend of new cotton was even more intense. Old cotton rose 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and new cotton rose 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. By the 23rd trade, it was unexpected that long position companies would take the opportunity to release large amounts of material, and the market suddenly loosened. Market prices gradually returned down. As a result, near-term was flat, and far-term rose 2.3 yuan. The former market traded a total of 143,100 dan. It was found that Rui Yuan sold 3,100 dan, Chang He 6,600 dan, Xin Heng 4,400 dan, Da Chang 10,700 dan, Yi Cheng 2,200 dan, Heng De 1,900 dan, Shen Chang 9,500 dan, Geng Feng 3,900 dan, Tong Ji 4,800 dan, Da Fu 3,600 dan, and Ji Feng 2,200 dan.

<h3>Main Reasons for Continued Rise in US Cotton: Drought Area Still Lacking...Speculators' Buying Power Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton's firmness and liveliness was due to good news in Liverpool, drought in the dry areas, and speculative buying. As a result, spot prices rose by 25 pounds, and futures prices rose by 21 to 25 pounds. English cotton futures rose by 21. Cotton initially strengthened due to purchases by exporters from the continent, then returned due to profit taking. As a result, Er rose by , Robi and Omura rose by 4 Robi and 7.5, Bai Luo Creek rose by 5 Robi. The original electricity record is on the left (10th telegram):</p>

<h3>The Grain and Flour Market Turns Bullish Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed signs of briskness across all months. Chicago wheat quotations rose by about 24 points, and Canadian wheat by varying amounts up to 12 points. After the opening prices were announced, the minds of both insiders and outsiders were stirred. Due to the continuing drought and expectations for rising rice prices, there was a long-dormant desire to act. Therefore, the opening market prices were up from the previous day by varying amounts up to one or two cents. Fortunately, the various mills, in order to calm public sentiment, continued to sell off their holdings in succession. This kind of hedging sale is a formal transaction by the mills, unlike the naked short selling of outsiders, which has no real basis. Therefore, although public sentiment was bullish, the extent of the rise was still moderate, and the market prices even fell back close to a cent from the opening prices. If, thereafter, the heavens grant our wishes and bring abundant rain, the tense situation may be settled. As a result, the current month rose by 7.5 cents, August by 1 cent, September by 1.75 cents, October by 1.5 cents, November by 1.25 cents, and December by 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3>Hoarders Continue to Buy Forward Wheat, Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a pattern of being weak in the near term and stable in the long term. The opening price for the current month was not reduced due to the after-effects of the hedging sales by northern customers and the fact that the supply of spot goods had not decreased due to the drought. Therefore, public sentiment remained stable. However, due to the drought, sentiment towards the long-term contracts remained firm, and opening prices were stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, encouraged by the slight improvement in the morning flour market, outside speculation turned bullish again. Moreover, hoarding buyers were heard to be continuously accumulating positions, so the prices in various trading sessions rose again. As a result, August and September rose by 3 cents each from the previous day, October by 2 cents, and November by 3 cents. The arrival of spot wheat is still strong, and the mills are quite greedy to buy. High-quality wheat prices rose by one or two cents. The opening price for Xuzhou wheat was 3.08 yuan, Guide wheat was 3.09 yuan, Suzhou and Wuhe wheat was 3.07 yuan, Yaowan and Linhuai Pass wheat was 3.05 yuan, Bengbu wheat was 3.06 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat was 2.88 to 2.92 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 2.91 yuan, Daqiao wheat was 2.95 yuan, and Yangzhou wheat was 2.95 yuan, with lower quality wheat at 2.93 yuan. Fuxin took 10,000 bags, Fufeng took 2,000 bags, Xinda took 2,000 bags, and Shenda took 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>River Rice Arrives, Falls Back Two Jiao; Only Transmuted Currency Goods are Scarce and Do Well</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various gangs was slightly greater, with about 26 or 27 boatloads arriving (approximately 4,000-plus shi). Sales in the market suddenly turned weak. From the opening of the market to the close, there was little progress. Except for the ordinary gang japonica rice, which was still attractive due to the scarcity of goods, the prices of other types, such as Su, Tong, and South Port rice, all fell by one or two jiao. Furthermore, late-season rice of medium to lower quality, such as Qingjiao, Sijing, and Xilian rice, also fell by two or three jiao. Only Du Yang's premium rice was unaffected, and transmuted currency goods, being scarce and fragrant, did exceptionally well, rising by four or five jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply of river rice from the thousand gangs was 15 or 16 boatloads. Due to the hot weather, few goods from various sources were available in the market, resulting in sluggish sales. The market for white japonica rice was stable but trending weaker, while the arrival of white yuan rice was low and sales were slow, with prices tight by one or two jiao. Thin japonica rice and various pointed rice types remained stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms and Local Merchants Purchase Nearly 10,000 Bags of Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm indica rice market was active again. Due to the recent hot weather and prolonged drought, river mills' rice prices are uniformly high. Moreover, with inland river channels drying up and supplies disrupted, market sentiment is unanimously bullish. Therefore, foreign firm indica rice is also quite lively. Although transactions did not exceed 10,000 bags, inquiries from customers in various regions made the market quite brisk. Total market transactions included 6,000 bags of milled and broken indica rice, and 2,000 bags of small refined indica rice. The main buyers were local merchants and hoarders, with other transactions involving Ningbo and Chongming gangs. As a result, the price of small refined rice rose again from 8.00 yuan to 8.10 yuan. The prices of other indica rice types all remained firm. If the arrival of new supplies does not become strong and sales continue to be active, market prices may rise further.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Local Fine White Sugar Supply Short, Price Rises Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market stabilized as customs gold rose and then leveled off. The association's opening price for Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 20.005 yuan, up two cents from yesterday. Local warehouse goods were 20.15 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's B Mark was 20.50 yuan, CW Mark was 20.15 yuan, DY Mark was 19.95 yuan, and HX Mark was 19.70 yuan. The price of local factory fine white sugar rose sharply by half a jiao due to a supply shortage. Zhenji No. 1 opened at 18.95 yuan. Over 500 bags of Chaoqing sugar were offered yesterday, with washed-and-refined Qing sugar at 13.20 yuan, Huanggang Qing sugar at 13.00 yuan, and Longgang Qing sugar at 12.40 yuan, up one jiao from before.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Silk Cocoon, and Miscellaneous Trade News Summary</h3>
<p>Pinghu New Summer Cocoon Production Poor, Quality Low: Although the number of households raising summer silkworms in various cities and villages this year is not weak, production has suffered due to the hot and humid weather, with outbreaks of silkworm disease. In addition, mulberry leaves have withered due to the drought, leading to insufficient feeding of the silkworms. Cocoon production has declined, and the quality is poor. There are few cocoon merchants weighing and purchasing cocoons. Most people are reeling their own local silk and selling it to silk firms.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Only Work Half Days in the Morning: Since the new cocoons came on the market, more than 30 silk factories in the Chinese and foreign-controlled areas of the city have started operations one after another. However, recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and the temperature in the workshops is often above 100 degrees, making it impossible to work. Therefore, in accordance with the usual practice, summer vacations have been temporarily suspended, and only half days are worked in the morning. Normal operations will resume after the autumn weather cools down.</p>
<p>Customs Seizes Smuggled Tax-Evasive Artificial Silk: Artificial silk from a certain country is often smuggled into Shanghai by fishing boats. The Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling patrol ship recently inspected two fishing boats from a certain country outside the Wusongkou and found a large amount of smuggled tax-evasive artificial silk, totaling 500 boxes and valued at 500,000 yuan, in a secret cabin. The customs has confiscated the goods in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Cables Still Not Forwarded: The European and American raw silk markets are sluggish because silk weaving factories are on summer vacation. Inventories are high, and sales are slow. Shanghai mills are still reluctant to forward orders because they consider the prices too high. Domestic silk factories are also weak in demand, making silk sales even more sluggish.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Actively Sold to Europe</h3>
<p>Previously, Qimen black tea prices had become sluggish due to the high exchange rate for British currency. Yesterday, the London market showed demand for upper and middle-grade teas, and the exchange rate had returned to a stable level. Therefore, foreign firms such as Tianyu, Tianxiang, Xingcheng, and Jinlong have all started to take action, making the market quite active. However, the opening prices were five or six yuan lower. The green tea market also showed no major progress. Although the sales of various grades of Chun Mee are not very slow, prices have been reduced across the board by seven or eight yuan due to excessive arrivals. The prices of other items, such as Needle Mee and Gongxi, have also fallen by varying amounts from one or two yuan to three or four yuan.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of China's Literary Heritage</h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>—Thoughts on Reading the "Special Issue on China's Literary Heritage" in "Literature," Vol. 2, No. 6—</p>
<p>Recently, "Literature," Vol. 2, No. 6, published a "Special Issue on China's Literary Heritage." They want to use new methods and new perspectives to provide a new assessment and new analysis of China's literary heritage. They believe that within China's literary heritage, if one is willing to use new perspectives and new methods to conduct a new assessment and new analysis, one will certainly be able to obtain many good materials. This countless amount of Chinese literary heritage, although as cluttered as a stretch of yellow sand, contains a great deal of gold dust. If we are willing to put in some effort, the harvest will certainly be very rich. This is the reason why they want to propose organizing China's literary heritage and accepting China's literary heritage.</p>
<p>China's literary heritage is very rich. We do not deny this point. It is true that only with new methods and new perspectives can one organize and dissect some new materials from China's literary heritage; these materials are very beneficial to us. We do not deny this point either. However, is it the right time to organize China's literary heritage and accept China's literary heritage? China's literary heritage should be organized and accepted, but is it the right time to organize and accept it? This is something that one cannot help but have some doubts about.</p>
<p>China's literary heritage is, after all, a heritage. No matter how rich and great China's literary heritage is, it is still literature of the past. No matter how worthy China's literary heritage is for us to organize and accept today, this heritage is useless for our work today. The content of China's literary heritage is broad, and whether it contains countless amounts of yellow sand or gold dust, these things have nothing to do with our needs today. Why? Because the current era is an era in which the contradictions of objective reality have risen to their peak. In this era, everything is in the extremely tense torrent of contradictions. Contradictions represent everything at present. In this way, what is expressed, whether in the social or cultural aspects, should be the representative points of all contradictions. Only in this way can this society and this culture not lose their significance of the times. However, these are not found in China's literary heritage. China's literary heritage is as rich and valuable as it is, but it can never be coordinated with this era or used by this era in any way. In this way, the issue of organizing China's literary heritage becomes completely meaningless at present. This is nothing more than a very skillful method for a few people to avoid contradictions and evade the times. What organizing China's literary heritage and accepting China's literary heritage, it's all just for show. What more substantial content do we see in this?</p>
<p>China's literary heritage is worth organizing and should be organized, but at least after the contradictions of objective reality have weakened somewhat. And at this time, there is an absolute need for literature that expresses contradictions and resolves contradictions. Organizing China's literary heritage and accepting China's literary heritage, at this time, should be interpreted as avoiding contradictions and being afraid of approaching contradictions. However, contradictions will eventually crush them.</p>
<h3>Momentary Impression</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Putting an old felt hat on my head, burying my hands in the pockets of my overcoat, and hiding an anxious heart under my white shirt, I jumped on the first tram that came through the drizzle.</p>
<p>Sitting down among the sparse group of passengers, wiping away the raindrops from my eyes, a pair of large female eyes appeared before me. I began to examine these large eyes and the person who possessed them!</p>
<p>If this being were to be viewed as a sculpture, it should be made by a sculptor who would not disappoint. The lines, yes, how even those lines are! How soft! There is not a single trace of rough workmanship. Whether the appraiser is intelligent or foolish, he will not be left with an unsatisfactory impression here. But if this being is appreciated as a work of art, the situation is different... The two patches of bright red on the cheeks make one suspect that the painter has applied excessive oil paint. The cloud-like hair is also too short, too short. If the painter were not lazy, adding one or two more strokes could create a very beautiful example with the oval face. The face is white, but it is not unpleasant, and the purple robe that sets it off is also a very appropriate color tone. However, the lower half of the application is superfluous. It would be best to draw a bust smoothly and use thicker oil paint to smear everything below the waist. And if there is excess oil paint, it can be applied to those not-unpleasant large eyes, because whether viewed in terms of color or shape, these eyes need some more refined embellishment...</p>
<p>While fantasizing, this being moved. Facing me. Her gaze bit at my gaze, and I lowered my head in fear.</p>
<p>What should I think about with my head down? Treating my heart as a colony. The power of this image is gradually growing larger. The invaded needs to resist. This is why I raised my head again.</p>
<p>And her head turned away shyly.</p>
<p>In victory, an idea suddenly grew in my heart. Without a companion, for several years, I have been wandering around, harboring a heart without attachment, and leaving my footprints in many villages and ports in China. Watching the sunlight chase the dust of the carts forward, carefully</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>tearing off each page of the calendar. In this season between spring and summer, everyone's heart should be filled with happiness, but what about the wanderer's home? What about the wanderer's home?</p>
<p>On the bustling streets, small Western umbrellas with many bones must have been placed in the bright shop windows, right? Well-lacquered furniture should have its place in every warm and comfortable home, right? The dim sum and clear tea in Cantonese restaurants often give people a sense of leisurely teahouse atmosphere. In addition, there are cherry-red lights in the night parks, and lavender and lilac lights in the dance halls. The roads shaded by cypress and juniper bridges have lights made of white gravel. The sense of urban enjoyment is often only able to drift into the arms of those who have smiling faces.</p>
<p>Like the flowing sky on the horizon, I lightly flowed out my hazy thoughts.</p>
<p>Facing the clear and bright pair of large eyes, I could not help but pull my thoughts to another pair of even brighter large eyes. That is on the other side of the sea, in a place where a gentle breeze lightly fans. That is where the person I secretly bless is hidden.</p>
<p>But we are so far apart. Looking at the horizon outside the car window, the horizon is falling with fine rain, soft like a beaded curtain. "It's summer," I subconsciously said to myself... "But I don't feel warm in my heart!"</p>
<p>That pair of eyes makes me feel sad, and there is also that rain, that rain silk that disturbs my thoughts and pulls me back to the corners of my clothes!</p>
<h3>The Distance of Appreciation</h3>
<p>— Muyin</p>
<p>Have you ever had this experience? Just when the money in your pocket is empty, just when a friend urges you to go to the movies. So what? You have to borrow... Yes, you have that little bit... You muddle through, just watching it is enough.</p>
<p>It was in this situation that I watched "Nana." My debtor happened to be a poor devil like me—birds of a feather flock together—he scraped together six jiao and shamefully stuffed it into my sweaty hand.</p>
<p>Escorted by the gazes of many familiar and unfamiliar people, we finally found two seats in the front rows. In a moment, darkness brought these two poor and sincere worshipers of beauty into the world of art.</p>
<p>But we were sitting too close, distorting everything on the screen in a way that was not proportional. We couldn't see anything, just a flat mass of lines fluttering before our eyes.</p>
<p>Why? Besides the visual reaction, it was because we were sitting too close to the screen. The tool of beauty deprived me of the opportunity to experience the atmosphere and mood of beauty.</p>
<p>I then understood that "distance" is necessary for appreciating art. However, this distance is not limited to the physical aspect. Psychological distance is equally necessary.</p>
<p>Someone said that it is a cold nose that can smell scents, and it is cold eyes that can discern colors. This saying of "the bystander sees the game" does not violate science. "Familiarity" is the glue between friends, but it is the devil for those who appreciate art. It will use mundane and even irrelevant memories to disturb our appreciation of beauty. When looking at a landscape painting, if we can say what place it is, it will naturally make the painting more concrete. We can even add a missing bridge or a temple in our imagination. However, precisely because it is connected to the real object, the effect of art is diminished.</p>
<p>I often see friends asking about the dynasty and hand of a painting. But when a Chinese painting is placed in front of a foreigner, he only immerses himself, or rather loses himself, in the painting, groping for the lines, the piles of dots, the patches of color that symbolize the feelings of the Eastern people, and the feeling that the painting gives to people by mixing and kneading them together.</p>
<p>I have also seen a French woman hanging the large coarse bowl that we use to hold porridge in the countryside in her elegant living room, folding her hands, and carefully savoring the rough and simple lines on it. I once laughed heartily at an old Englishman who hung the signboard of our Chinese noodle restaurant in his study. Ha, "Xingtai Restaurant"! This thing helps me remember the oily table. But he only appreciates the majestic brushstrokes and the combination of the gold lacquer color on it!</p>
<p>Antique collectors, when they value "authenticity" too much, will neglect beauty. Appreciators, when they are too familiar with everything about the original art object, will lose that intoxication that comes from obscurity.</p>
<p>"The intoxication of art is not due to the art object... but due to the appreciator not understanding the thing..." Who said this beautiful sentence? Regardless of who said it, there should be such a truth.</p>
<p>In many places, the exotic has been more highly appreciated than the domestic. I often suspect that Mrs. Buck's success in the New World publishing industry is closely related to this. It is not entirely about satisfying curiosity, but about her ability to obtain the beautiful effects that she has arranged. Her readers are waiting for her "stimulus," and providing the reactions that she wants. They do not have unruly imaginations to jump from Wang Lung to someone else. Just like "tiger bone wine" (see page 4 of "The Young Revolutionary"), to a Chinese person, it is just a bottle of medicine with a red seal, sold by traveling peddlers to treat falls and injuries to deceive people. But to a foreigner, just "tiger bone" is enough to evoke a sense of strength.</p>
<p>In fact, in China, which is good at making moving nouns, simply translating certain place names is enough to make many foreigners who have never seen the world forget themselves. Translating Humen into Piger Gate would make people feel a sense of solemnity that is inaccessible—when in fact foreign warships can enter and exit freely. Translators who have served as interpreters for European and American travelers to China will remember how leisurely and ethereal the listeners were when they translated "Paiyun Hall" literally!</p>
<p>Every day at dawn, hearing the sound of the bugle from the nearby military camp is much more profound in the heart of a soldier.</p>
<p>For the sake of heat and practicality, we cannot deeply approach art. If we want to improve this difficulty, it is not about avoiding existing obstacles, but about creating a new ability—that is, training our nerves to react to beauty and maintaining a distance between ourselves and the art object. In the moment of appreciation, eliminate the thoughts that are irrelevant to that beauty. It is said that Michelangelo, when killing people, would take a small notebook to write down the terrifying state of the criminals. He was coldly indifferent and did not feel any pity. Others saw it as somewhat inhuman, but it was a good example of maintaining distance.</p>
<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Jingjia</p>
<p>I didn't sleep well last night. I was too sad. The teardrops soaked a large patch on the pillow embroidered with an arrow piercing two hearts. I got out of bed as soon as it got light, still wearing my clothes. I felt very dizzy. I paced alone in the courtyard, from this side to that side, and then I stopped, then from that side to this side, and then I stopped again...</p>
<p>I don't understand why I am so attached to my hometown. The rural economy is bankrupt, and my hometown cannot be spared. The haggard faces and sad sighs of the villagers, which are caused by their struggle for survival, are also intolerable to me. Moreover, my hometown does not have beautiful mountains or clear and tranquil water. It does not have the beautiful and lovely scenery that I imagine. My hometown has mountains that look like they have ringworm and streams that flow in zigzag lines. It has sadness, and it has darkness. Yet I am always attached to my hometown. I am attached to my hometown for reasons that I cannot explain.</p>
<p>I always think that I can live in my hometown forever. But this is just an ideal. To me, ideals and reality are always two parallel lines that will never intersect. I am attached to my hometown, but I cannot leave my hometown. I have to go to a distant city to study. Everyone in the village is urging me to leave my hometown, because I can become an official and make money in the future, and they can benefit from it. Yes, they will never understand me. They all think that the purpose of studying is to become an official, and that becoming an official is a great thing. They don't know that a hometown can be something to be attached to, and they don't know that a person's emotions are precious.</p>
<p>Yet I cannot but leave my hometown. I sighed, looking at the fish-belly white east. The half-moon hanging in the sky coldly illuminated the earth. The rooster crowed, followed by a few intermittent barks from the dog.</p>
<p>My aunt got up too, and was busy cooking for me. I looked at the white hair on her head that swayed with the wind, and felt very sad. The firewood was burning crackling in the stove. The water in the pot was also hissing. Tears blurred my eyes again.</p>
<p>I opened the door and walked to the drying ground behind the house. A thin layer of white mist covered the mountains and fields. Only the golden rice ears could still be vaguely discerned. A large patch of scarlet clouds was in the east. Plumes of smoke rose from every roof. Several yellow dogs lay on the ground, looking at me like wooden chickens.</p>
<p>My aunt's call to eat woke me up. The sun had already risen, and the white mist had receded. The roots of the surrounding mountains clearly entered my eyes. The dew on the grass wet the tips of my shoes. I went home with a numb and heavy body.</p>
<p>After eating, I listlessly packed my luggage. Xing Ge, who was seeing me off, came early and made the luggage into a load, carrying it on his shoulders.</p>
<p>I took my hat, looked at my aunt, and couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Study hard!" my aunt instructed. I saw the white hair on her head again, and my eyes filled with tears again.</p>
<p>Why are there so many sad things in life!</p>
<p>So I left. My hometown faded behind me, staying in my mind, forever and forever.</p>
<h3>Praying for Rain and Banning Slaughter</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>When I was a child, if I carelessly dropped rice on the ground, my grandmother would say that the God of Heaven would strike with thunder. At that time, I thought that the wind, clouds, rain, and snow were all controlled by the so-called God of Heaven. Later, when I went to elementary school and read textbooks, I learned that rain, dew, and frost were just water. The concept of the God of Heaven was thus shattered.</p>
<p>Now, after a long drought, the blue sky above is not the God of Heaven, but the farmers are busy praying for rain and banning slaughter. However, they are not seeking fundamental solutions. So, no matter how loudly the progressive writers shout about the issue of construction, the fact that farmers do not have money to study is as solid as iron. And the writers who shout slogans would rather take their稿费to dance halls and cafes. Construction, construction is just a verbal charge. Our farmers can only piously pray for rain and ban slaughter, using the Buddhist philosophy of their grandmothers.</p>
<p>I wonder what the "progressive writers" should say now?</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h3>Tao-ge</h3>
<p>— Ruo Jin</p>
<p>Tao-ge, with the gentleness of a woman, the stubbornness of a rock, and the melancholy of cement.</p>
<p>"Tao-ge, your reasoning is wrong." But Tao-ge never admits defeat or acknowledges mistakes. Take buying peanuts, for instance. Peanuts are Tao-ge's cigarettes, Tao-ge's wine, something he craves every day. In Shanghai, six copper coins for a large bag of peanuts is naturally considered cheap, but Tao-ge says no. He ignores the convenience in terms of time and place, insisting that Nanjing is cheaper. When people give in, it's because they don't want to argue with him anymore. Thus, Tao-ge gains a small victory, feeling happy, but the happier he is, the more he sinks into loneliness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tao-ge enjoys a quiet life and prefers to shut himself in a small room. Sometimes we feel that excessive solitude makes a person look pale, so we deliberately strike up a conversation to cheer him up. But Tao-ge doesn't welcome it. When he sees us, he immediately hides the long letter he was copying. It turns out Tao-ge's heart isn't lonely.</p>
<p>Since the expiration of the permits for Hongkou Park, Tao-ge rarely lingers outside. But in moments of extreme boredom, he would stagger alone onto the brightly lit streets, his bare feet taking slow, poetic steps on the ground, like a camel.</p>
<p>"Tao-ge, are you out of socks?" In Tao-ge's sensitive mind, this question has a hint of contempt, so he must immediately explain, "Now women don't wear socks, and neither do the Japanese." It seems that wearing socks is a bit outdated nowadays.</p>
<p>On Saturday nights, there are supposedly nude dances at the nearby dance school, where older women touch men's noses. Tao-ge wants to see what it's like, but he never goes.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, he always throws a basketball. Regarding this, there are truly untold hardships. The house is old-fashioned, and there's no flush toilet, so going outside is too far. But since discovering the "new continent" next to the railway tracks, he hasn't thrown the basketball much anymore.</p>
<p>Sleeping, too, is very military-like, just like me. We all sleep on the floor without beds.</p>
<p>Sometimes a stink bug would crawl out from the cracks in the partition wall of the back building. Sometimes a cheerful, soft song would drift out, the banned "Peach Blossom River." Tao-ge sings "Peach Blossom River" with a special tone, mostly due to his inner joy.</p>
<p>But one day, he was particularly depressed, unable to eat or sleep, and reportedly wanted to commit suicide.</p>
<p>"Tao-ge, shouldn't this news be cause for joy? Wouldn't your fiancée's pregnancy hasten the realization of your marriage? Besides, her letter only says she feels a little nauseous and wants to vomit. Her period is just late, and she's probably worried it might be there. So it's not certain yet." We comforted him like this. He said, "What if it is? I'll have to get married, but I don't have any money." He only ate a bowl of thin noodles for lunch.</p>
<p>Three days passed quickly, and the postman finally brought good news. It was like a strong dose of medicine. Tao-ge shouted when he saw it. People who don't know his inner thoughts wouldn't understand what he said next.</p>
<p>"No, no, her period came, she said it didn't!"</p>
<p>"Tao-ge, it didn't? Let's play a little mahjong." Tao-ge was already very happy and wanted to take advantage of the joyful mood to win some money for peanuts and stamps... so he agreed to play.</p>
<p>Tao-ge is a seasoned mahjong player, but experience doesn't guarantee winning. He lost several rounds of five hundred coins each. "Even the stamp money is gone!" Tao-ge felt an empty pocket with not a single copper coin. But this didn't diminish Tao-ge's inner joy, because his fiancée's period had arrived.</p>
<p>The banned "Peach Blossom River" drifted out from the cracks in the partition wall of the back building again and again, with a particularly unique tone, as gentle as a woman.</p>
<h3>Mr. Jiang Dongliang's Work</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dongliang</p>
<p>Year 23 of the Republic of China Jiang</p>
<h3>One of Shanghai's Tycoons</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Little Mao's Mother</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>Little Mao's mother's shadow disappeared behind the back door again.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law of the side room... have you had dinner yet?" When she came down the stairs, a charming smile flitted across her face. Little Mao's mother is different now. A year's change can be so quick. When she moved into this house, she wore a printed cotton dress; she only wore it when going to the nearby cinema. Now, she wears a transparent gauze cheongsam outside a silk vest with white lace trim; her undulating breasts quiver. Her feet are in mesh high heels with white powder on them, revealing her snow-white thighs. The waves in her hair are like the smoke stacks of the Huangpu River fleet exhaling. Apricot-yellow rouge, scarlet nail polish, Little Mao's mother, under the influence of the material civilization of the city; has become a woman of the times, under the giants of many urban erotic cultures, forming a fleshy idol for the general pursuers.</p>
<p>Little Mao's mother has only been in Shanghai for a year. Her husband is a stoker on a Yangtze River ship. Although workers' wages are very meager now, sailors are equally restricted. Because Little Mao's father knows people well, he also does some carrying of goods. In the best months, he makes over a hundred dollars in income.</p>
<p>With this favorable income, Little Mao's mother has been shaped into a city woman's idol. Little Mao's mother, like ordinary city women, is addicted to gambling. When her husband is on the stormy river, holding a coal shovel and feeding the iron pot, she is under the hot light bulb, touching tiles on a mahogany table. This turned a simple Little Mao's mother into a glamorous woman. A young woman often feels sexually thirsty. In the city's nightlife, Little Mao's mother has fallen into the trap of a world of evil.</p>
<p>Previously, her husband's hard-earned income was enough to support this small family. A woman's vanity deepens with time. Everyone is ultimately dissatisfied with real life! She often runs off with her girlfriends to amusement parks, where scenes of erotic culture and sexual life are staged; deeply engraved in Little Mao's mother's heart. Being with a husband who leads a sailing life is not happy; she often feels that.</p>
<p>This has led to Little Mao's mother's downfall!</p>
<p>"Friend... how about being a matchmaker?"</p>
<p>When she starts going to the warehouses, a woman's unique shyness flits across her face. But she sees so many of her kind, and after trying it; she realizes this is an ordinary performance.</p>
<p>And she is happy with these young lads. They have white and plump faces, shiny hair, and lavish clothes. At least, they are more presentable than Little Mao's father. It makes her think "a beautiful flower is stuck in a pile of cow dung," that she will never enjoy happiness with an ordinary man.</p>
<p>There are also shiny silver dollars and colorful banknotes, she often dreams of becoming a rich lady, this scene of rose-colored longing. She hates that Little Mao is so uncomprehending, that he will suffer in the future. He often makes a noise "Mom; I want to go out with you." And when Little Mao's father's ship enters the dock, she is like a little bird in a golden cage; unable to soar in the free sky! And he often pays attention to his wife after she has changed, fortunately he doesn't live there often, this temporary restraint feels like a prison-like blockade to her.</p>
<p>Little Mao's mother is mired in a life of pleasure and sex, returning to her apartment every day from the thin morning mist, in a rickshaw. Little Mao's sleep is very deep, from the full-length dressing mirror; she sees her own youth fading away. She lazily falls at Little Mao's feet, warming the sweet dreams of last night.</p>

<h3>Zheng Tian's Troubles</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a poor student in junior high school. Because of my poverty, I study all day long. I know nothing about marriage problems, so I am troubled by marriage all day long. Please help me solve it.</p>
<p>When I was ten years old, I was engaged to an unknown country girl by "parents' orders, matchmaker's words." She is illiterate and very violent. So I decided to cancel the engagement. But I know that I must be a full twenty years old to act freely. I currently have a girlfriend. We get along very well, and her parents fully approve. My parents also approve. However, she wants me to carry out the engagement ceremony with her, because she fears that I may change my mind. I don't want to agree, otherwise a rift will definitely occur in our love. If I get engaged, I'm afraid there will be a conflict with the previous engagement. Please! Give me detailed instructions in the Shenbao Amateur Mailbox in the near future, I dare to wish you well. Sincerely, Zhang Yungu, Wen'an</p>
<p>Answer: To dissolve an engagement made by parents, you must be an adult. However, according to the principles of civil law, engagements should be freely entered into by the parties involved. Therefore, the law does not force you to fulfill an engagement made by your parents. In other words, if that engagement was not obtained with your consent, it naturally cannot bind you. You are free to enter into an engagement with others. However, minors must obtain parental consent to get engaged. I'm afraid this point will cause trouble. Editor</p>

<h3>Lan Jiabao's State of Mind (V)</h3>
<p>— Xi Jun</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Back in her seat, she immediately smoked and drank coffee, her calm eyes still gazing calmly at the floor. She had no intention of raising her eyes and flirting, putting on a captivating smile, or tempting others, like those loose women.</p>
<p>She intended to sit through this piece. The music quickly ended. A man walked past her, and somehow the cigarette butt in his fingers suddenly fell onto the hem of her dress. Whether it was intentional or unintentional, he hurriedly shook it off for her, but it had already burned several small holes!</p>
<p>—Blind idiot.</p>
<p>She cursed fiercely.</p>
<p>—I'm sorry.</p>
<p>—Who's joking with you?</p>
<p>—I'm very sorry.</p>
<p>Then, with a touch of humor, he bent over low, almost touching his chest.</p>
<p>Several companions came out to mediate. One of them casually put his hand on her shoulder, revealing a crude and lewd face. She angrily pushed away the strong hand.</p>
<p>Furious, she said:</p>
<p>—You swine, it's none of your business, learn some manners.</p>
<p>Looking at the man who had put his hand on her shoulder, she gave him a contemptuous glance and spat an invisible mouthful of saliva. The man who had burned her dress grabbed her sleeve, wanting her to sit at the table and calculate the compensation for her loss. She just sat there silently, pursing her lips, not even paying attention.</p>
<p>So, someone muttered:</p>
<p>—Hey, she really doesn't know what's good for her.</p>
<p>—Who does she think she is? If she ran into me, she wouldn't be talking like that.</p>
<p>She clearly heard the bad words. It wasn't enough to ruin her dress for no reason, but they were also spouting a lot of nonsense. How tyrannical. But she was ultimately a weak woman, and she had to let people ridicule her at will. Thinking about it, she felt both angry and sad, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>Lan Jiabao cried, silently sobbing in her throat, breathing softly. No one noticed.</p>
<p>Even if they did notice, they would take it as a joke. But we clearly heard her sobbing, lightly and heavily, full of sorrow. Yes! A pair of gentle, beautiful, and sad little doves, adorned with a glamorous dress like a butterfly at night. Meekly and obediently doing cowardly little cat acts in the arms of many strangers, for a few coins, having to let people hold and step on her body, a few coins exchanged for a moment of fleshly trembling, is already sad enough!</p>

<h3>"Mass Language" and Sound Film</h3>
<p>— Xu Xingzhi</p>
<p>Recently, the proposal of "Mass Language" will become a prerequisite issue for all art and awaits resolution. However, writers and critics in the film industry are using a "cold eye" to observe the ongoing heated debate in the literary and art circles, seemingly indifferently letting this event pass.</p>
<p>On the "Torch" section of the Shanghai Evening News on July 6, Ni Lujun, with the headline "Critique of the Mass Language Problem," initially raised "How will sound films and stage plays, the most powerful tools for modernizing the masses, define their "dialogue" and "lines" as Mass Language and the sound film problem. Regarding this issue, our friends living in the film world have not yet expressed any opinions, which is truly a great regret.</p>
<p>Originally, modern sound films not only have the "narrative method" of literature and the performance method of drama to express the development of the story, but also rely on people's daily life "language" and "sound effects" to complete their posture as an art of imagery. In film, simply relying on narration and performance can no longer satisfy people's desires. Furthermore, people also demand more strong expressions of "language" and "sound" that fit their own lives. In other words, people not only demand visual satisfaction, but also demand auditory or olfactory satisfaction. (For example, the Soviet Union's "Sensory Theater" is currently testing the premiere of olfactory dramas). In the inseparable requirement of language and the screen, "Mass Language" has to become an important issue in current sound films.</p>
<p>Film writers and critics! We should discuss the issue of "Mass Language" in the developing Chinese sound films more enthusiastically and eloquently than in literature, because film has become the most powerful tool for educating the masses, and at the same time, film has more experimental effects than literature. For example, is the continuation or rejection of so-called "Mandarin" allowed in sound films? Can "dialects" and "local languages" be conditionally introduced? And how to establish "Mass Language" on the screen? I think this is definitely not an event that is unrelated to the future development of Chinese sound films, right? Here, I hope that film writers and critics will launch a heated discussion on this issue! At the same time, I look forward to "Mass Language" being tested and established on the screen with practical evidence!</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "As the Earth Turns" — Cathay</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Like "Little Women," "As the Earth Turns" is also adapted from a novel, and the playwright also preserves the literary flavor, that is, he transplants the artistic atmosphere to the film almost without discount.</p>
<p>Regarding the adaptation of novels into films, someone recently raised objections in magazine articles, arguing that films have their own unique content and form, and that bringing literature to the screen often loses the essence of the original work. He took the screen version of "Don Quixote" as an example, believing that it was a distorted failure compared to the novel, and opposed the production of literary films. Of course, this is very worthy of discussion. But we must take this opportunity to offer a simple opinion: we are not opposed to the existence of literary films?</p>
<p>We understand that when adapting a literary work, the playwright cannot simply transplant it without selection. This is not only a matter of capacity, but also because film should have its own unique dramatic existence. Obviously, literature and film are two different things, but if the filmmaker can express the literature in a way that it becomes film art, it may well be able to better preserve the true value of the original work.</p>
<p>Whether the film "Don Quixote" is successful or not is not the subject of this article, but there are many novel adaptations that are very successful, such as the silent film "Resurrection," which is the best example.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen many literary films, and now we will briefly review "As the Earth Turns." Regarding the theme of this film, we will discuss it below, but now we must first look at the presentation method. First of all, we should have this feeling: there is no rigorous story that is generally possessed by films, but rather the rustic flavor fully contained in the novel is expressed in an almost sketching and very poetic way. We seem to have experienced this method once in "Little Women," that kind of delicate psychological description in the novel, as well as the organic connection between the characters and the surrounding atmosphere, the literary atmosphere certainly fully depicts on the screen the imagination we have obtained from between the lines. We feel that although we are watching a play, we still retain the unique savoring that we have when reading a novel. Indeed, through the skilled technique of director Alfred E. Green, he completely poetically expresses the rural flavor and the dynamics of the characters. Light, serene, joyful, and also mournful. From winter to spring, from summer to winter, the changes in the scenery of the countryside and the hearts of the people intoxicate us with the beauty of nature, and at the same time make us feel a eulogy for the countryside. Among those people, some feel the monotony of simple life in the serene air, some feel resentment in the poor and hard life, some feel happy in the peaceful life, although her daily work is also very hard, and there are also the schoolchildren, they can only feel the pure and sincere emotions between people with innocence and vigor. Therefore, we can say that although the description of the complex human relationships in the crowd is only a separate description of three families, their grievances or sympathy are very delicate and vivid.</p>
<p>If it is not entirely wrong, then we believe that this kind of simple subject matter, as well as the light description, should be a new branch in the existing film art. Perhaps, as mentioned earlier, there is no strictly structured story like those common in general films, and from a commercial point of view, it will probably not be very successful, because general audiences demand bizarre and tortuous stories in their established habits. However, in terms of film art, this is a new attempt, and it is very suitable for the imaginative intellectual class. After watching, we think that in terms of creative techniques, there is nothing that can be easily criticized. Whether it is the description of each person's personality, the rendering of the surrounding atmosphere, or the rhythm of the tone, they are all very in line with film art. If there is still something that is not perfect, it is that when the Stein family's house is on fire, Stein himself is dancing with the neighboring girl, and when he waits for him to return home and looks at a pile of ashes, he does not show panic. On the contrary, he just ignores it. However, in general films, this is often used as the climax of the play. However, perhaps the director wanted it to be light to the end. Therefore, the fire after the big thunder, big wind, and heavy rain is only treated as a very ordinary event.</p>
<p>Whether it is in sound effects or the softness of photography, it is unified with the entire tone. Especially for the control of actors, because of the relationship between brothers and sisters, the main actors look very similar in appearance. Almost every actor shows the guiding power of the director. The success of the heroine Jean Muir should receive the highest honor. The clearest thing is her acting skills, which are not at all overdone, just right, with no anger, and what she gives us is full of reality. The other actors are very competent, and even the small actors, such as when the little lovers are separated and cry, are also very realistic, which shows the director's deep descriptive technique.</p>
<p>Finally, what we want to say is the content of the script.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, our opinion is this:</p>
<p>A peaceful countryside is probably not easy to see at present, and the theme of teaching farmers to be content and happy with their poor, simple lives, always guarding their own fields, fully expressing the praise of nature, is, in any case, a conclusion that is quite similar to the return to simplicity in the progress of the times, at least the playwright has not seen the cruel struggle of reality, but is making a beautiful recollection of the 18th-century countryside in the present era.</p>
<p>However, the expressive techniques determined by this content, which make us intoxicated in the atmosphere of praising nature, are indeed worthy of attention. Therefore, we admit that this is indeed a work worth seeing.</p>
<h3>"Spitfire" — Great Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>Following "Little Women," the fifth film starring Katharine Hepburn, "Spitfire," here she plays a "wildcat" "mountain" girl. Even though her performance was not a failure, everyone can see a kind of suppression of her personality restricted by the script.</p>
<p>In "Little Women," using Katharine Hepburn to play "Jo" only grasped a part of her uninhibited, slightly mysterious personality, but not all of it. However, in "Spitfire," we see that not only is Katharine Hepburn's partial personality not suitable for the personality of the character Trigger Hicks, but Hepburn's personality is completely subject to Trigger Hicks' personality. This is a pity, the American producers are so unable to grasp the personality of a talented actor.</p>
<p>Even in terms of the story of "Spitfire" itself, although it is similar to "Little Women" in that it is based on rural women, the entire plot develops from a chance encounter with a child, and Trigger Hick's foolish method of rescuing a child is also worthy of our ridicule.</p>
<p>Although the director John Cromwell's technique is not very poor, it is obviously also suffered from the script limitations. And the long scenes of John and Trigger talking about love not only fail to enhance the film, but also make the audience feel dull.</p>
<p>Apart from the climax of the villagers coming to make trouble for Trigger Hicks, the rest is consistently mediocre, leaving only verbose dialogue and some propaganda of religion. Isn't it? When the "crude" and "ignorant" villagers come to make trouble for her, Trigger Hicks loudly declares "Jesus said, I must love my enemies..." until finally Trigger Hicks prays "Resurrection and survival are only God's will, no one can kill this life..." to explain to herself that she did not kill the child. To have the audience sympathize with this innocent village girl is to have the audience give infinite sympathy and praise to a village girl who is a devout believer in God and is persecuted and left by the villagers. Do we really want to sympathize with this village girl who is a devout believer in God? No matter how the playwright wants us to sympathize, our answer is no.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Human Bondage, Part 17</h3>
<p>— Maugham</p>
<p>While Philip was alone in his room, lost in a daze, he felt Mildred's lips brushing and kissing his face. He suddenly awoke with a start, and opening his eyes, he saw not Mildred but Sally standing before him. Sally, looking at Philip, felt a pang of sorrow in her heart. She asked softly, "How are you feeling?" Philip remained silent, only shaking his head repeatedly. Sally ventured to ask, "Do you still love her?" Philip shook his head and said, "No." He then sighed deeply and said haltingly, "That's... that's it. My life is like this... Even before she died, she was already dead to me... both outside and inside me." He stared at Sally as if she were not there. After a while, he reached out, his hand trembling slightly, poured himself a glass of wine, and drank it down. Sally deliberately sought something to say, asking him, "When will you graduate from the hospital?" Philip sighed again and said, "In a few days." Sally said, "What will you do afterward?" Philip's eyes were fixed on several travel guide booklets. He had already decided to leave this place. It would be best to work as a doctor on a ship! To wander around the world, growing tired of one place and then changing to a new landscape, new air. Sally said, "Why don't you come back to the countryside with me? Father specifically asked me to invite you." Philip agreed to her... he was neither for nor against it... at least at the moment, he had no strength to resist.</p>
<p>However, after resting for a few days by the seaside in the countryside, as his mental and physical strength gradually returned, he decided to go far away again. He was unwilling to sacrifice the youthful and beautiful, flawless Sally for his incomplete life. He also didn't want to bind himself again. He would rather flee to a foreign land. He wanted to be free and unrestrained. One evening, he and Sally sat by the sea, with the boundless water in front of them and a moon shining brightly above. He told her that he would prefer to be a doctor on a ship. He looked at her, seeing the love that she couldn't hide in her eyes, but he deliberately hardened his own heart like iron and stone. He said, "In my life, the matter of love has already caused me deep and grievous pain. I can no longer spin a cocoon around myself and seek my own troubles." Sally said, "Does that mean that to avoid love, a person can be without a heart?" Philip said, "That's not entirely true... but... when my heart is stimulated, I'll just move forward." Sally said, "When are you leaving?" "Tomorrow," Philip said.</p>
<p>Sally's eyes were filled with tears, and she was almost about to cry. She said, "But you are clearly here now." Philip deliberately closed the door to his heart tightly, not yielding to love at all. Sally said again, "I like you very much... I will always remember you in the future..." This made Philip want to cry, but his heart was already frozen. He would seek pain to relieve pain, seek bitterness to overcome bitterness. His heart may not necessarily have turned to dead ashes and wood, but after this extreme pain, he was no longer in the mood to talk about love. He could only inflict punishment on himself to feel more mentally clear. He could only watch Sally's tearful farewell and silently savor the taste of new wounds on his heart, revealing a desire only for peace of mind. (The End)</p>
