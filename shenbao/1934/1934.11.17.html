<p>時評</p>
<h3>建設西北水利與救濟農村</h3>
<p>年來農村破產。少壯鋌而走險。老弱轉乎溝壑。而沿江濱海之通商城市。則苦於資金過剩。物價不免隨　之而騰踴。坐是國民經濟頗呈畸形發展之弊。有識之士。乃多倡為［到內地去］之論調。而大好西北。尤為其注意之點。東北既亡。國人對於西北益加重視。本不足怪。而況西北亦夙稱天富。今日果能積極開發。善為防守。使不為東北之續。則失之東隅者。不難得之桑榆。全國領袖中如戴傅賢宋子文等諸氏。既數有西北之巡遊。而東南濱海各地之金融業。亦漸次注意於西北業務之推廣。此皆風氣轉變之象徵。可以引為欣慰者也。最近陜西省政府與國內金融業。更有合力從事於引渭灌田之舉。此舉現已成為事實。不可謂非西北人民之福也。</p>
<p>言夫西北水利事業之建設。吾人當能憶及涇洛兩渠之完成。渠水灌田。逹百萬畝以上。實以全國經濟委員會之力居多。此次陜西省政府繼起努力引渭築閘。嘉惠農村。其功亦不可沒。尤可贊許者。以如此重要之工程。而並未借重分文之外資。蓋其工程費一百五十萬元。係由國內五銀行所貸出。而卽以前所築涇洛兩渠之水畝捐等作擔保。金融業信仰政府機關之熱心。於此又得一例證。</p>
<p>吾國以農立國。農村經濟。原為國民經濟之重心。近年西北一隅。所以陷於破產之狀態。亦卽由於農民僅能提供其肉體之勞動力。而無由獲得生活必需之衣食。是以淪為盜匪者有之。死於饑饉者有之。卽幸而能逃荒離鄉。覓食於城市。亦不過加深市民失業之恐慌。吾人有西北豊富之實藏。而仍令資源坐棄。民生塗炭。當地受累之不足。又轉促全國國民經濟之衰落。不亦大可哀耶。夫水利事業與農村建設。本有密切之關係者也。而西北之需要水利。尤較他處為急切。投資於西北水利事業之意義。較之擲數千百萬元於公債地產之賣買者。殊有天壞之別矣。</p>
<p>總之。欲求西北農業之復興。必有待於水利事業之提倡。然而西北資金枯竭。力不勝任。則又端賴都市金融業之援助。始克有濟。今引渭築渠之所費。不過一百五十萬元。其數固不得謂鉅。而其造福於西北者。已遠勝於一般不落邊際之救濟方案。深願全國各省之執政當局及中央水利機關。皆能就各地農村需要水利之實況。擬訂剴切詳明之計劃。然後再與都市金融業相磋商。要求投資。按步實行。毋令涇洛兩渠與夫最近之引渭工程專美於前也。</p>

<h3>英外部通和郭使否認為偽國貨欵</h3>
<p>艾登並向衆院宣布</p>
<p>無與日本談判之事</p>
<p>日本大使訪美外長</p>
<p>倫敦今日清晨消息、外部昨日曾向中國公使郭泰祺確切否認英國有為［滿洲國］借欵日本之意、郭公使因最近謠傅、謂倫敦海軍談話與英日之政治及經濟活動發生關係云　因向外部詢問一切、茲悉郭氏曾特別提出傅說中所稱日本要求英國承認在華特殊利益及在太平洋之特殊地位、而日本方面願以不侵犯英國在華及在太平洋之利益為交換條件一點、據英國可靠方面向美聯社稱、此種傅說、或起於海軍談話初起之時、因日本曾向英國表示願維持英日最觀善之關係、而英國亦曾請東京解釋此點也、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦掌重大臣艾登今日在衆院聲稱、現在英日兩國對於遠東現狀以及［滿洲國］之前途、並未進行交涉或談話云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>華成頓日本駐美大使齊藤今日聲稱、日本因環境關係、或將不得已而作美國與［滿洲國］之居間人、以解決滿洲煤油專賣之爭端云、此項聲明係齊藤與國務總理赫爾在國務院會議畢後所發、惟彼亦聲稱、今日並未以此點向赫氏建議、今日會議之中雖會論及［滿洲國］、然雙方皆未提及煤油專賣問題、茲悉赫氏現方繼續研究日本覆文、準備決定美國以後應取步驟云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓齊藤又謂、本日與國務總理赫爾會晤時、並未提議日本願出而斡旋、兩人所討論者純為遠東一般問題云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>偽煤油專賣英商協議對策</h3>
<p>倫敦［滿洲國］政府公布煤油專賣政策、英國各煤油公司重視此事、十五日召開各代表緊急委員會商義對策、各代表均望友誼的解決、故對滿洲煤油公司大連製油所不賣原油等報復手段、似不致實現、（十五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>太平洋航空日擬向德購飛船與美國計劃相抗</h3>
<p>東京以樺山資英任會長之航空國策研究會、決於來年之春、以資本金二千萬元組織日［滿］合辦太平洋航空公司、以飛行船三隻開拓太平洋航空路、以對抗汎亞美利加航空公司開設桑港。檀香山。馬尼刺與上海之太平洋橫斷飛行、先以六百萬元於來春由德國購入齊泊林型飛行船一隻、開設東京長春間不靠岸飛行之航空路、因此本月二十日齊泊林公司技師普萊德霍夫、將代表愛資克萊博士來日交涉、如此第一期計劃成功、則增加資本、以常備飛行船三隻、實施太平洋之定期航空、（十六日電通電）</p>
<h3>軍縮會議中英將有新建議</h3>
<p>監察軍火擴大範圍</p>
<p>英美結萬聯合陣綫</p>
<p>倫敦英國政府將於下星期二日軍縮會議主席團開會時、由掌重大臣艾登提出監察軍火之建議、一般人相信、此次提案將較內閣第一次所擬議之草案範圍更為廣大、按英國第一次草案、僅就英國所採行之軍火輸出特許制度加以普遍化而已、今則更進一步主張建立一種更廣泛更有效之監察制度、英國所以改變態度、或係受最近華盛頓文面所主張監察軍火之影響、或則另有其他原因、均未可知、此次英國提案包含三項、一製造軍火應請領特許執照、二軍火輸出應請領特許執照、三各國應發表關於軍械耶彈出產數額之報告、此項提案與本星期一日美國國務卿赫爾所提出之計畫、如出一轍、可見日內瓦會議中關於軍火監察一事、英美兩國間不難結萬聯合陣綫、此間一般人以為英國如堅持此種主張、在勢必遭德國文面之反對、蓋此種監察計畫一旦實行、則凡貯藏及製造軍械耶彈而為國聯會所未能查悉者、將不能再事隱瞞也、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國際統制軍火貿易美詢意國見解</h3>

<h3>英軍縮政策唯有三途可循</h3>
<p>願助國聯製定公約</p>
<p>國防需要不容漠視</p>
<p>倫敦掌重大臣艾登、昨晚發表演說、再度說明英國政府對於和平問題所採取之態度、首先指責若干國家所行之［軍事訓練］、聽衆皆鼓掌稱善、嗣入正題、謂［吾人現有三種政策、可以採用、一孤立政策頗足動聽、但在實際上不可能、二單獨裁軍、亦屬荒誕、英國一旦解除軍備、卽無力促進和平、三折衷辦法、亦卽吾人所當採用者、質言之、卽擔負責任以援助國聯會、俾克制定軍縮公約、並將擁護和平之聯合制度、予以充實、同時對於國防目前需要、亦不加以忽視是也］云云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英提新妥協案羅斯福鄭重考慮</h3>
<p>現比率與平等權兼顧</p>
<p>失敗後英美合作計劃</p>
<p>華盛頓國務總理赫爾今日接悉臺維斯特使之英美海軍談判報告全文、赫爾宣稱、彼現帶此報告至滕納西、羅斯福總統正在該州視察、聞將對此報告鄭重考慮、茲據可靠消息、英外部曾細心探詢、三角會議失敗後、美國顧於何種基礎上考慮英美合作計劃、國務院對此迄未有具體答覆、據此間公意、美國絕對反對日本海軍實際平等、亦不願接受裁減主力艦及飛機母艦之任何建議云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦英美海軍代表昨日開會前後、載有各國讓步之海軍新約似有成立之可能性、英代表昨已將籌備此種新約之問題、提交美代表、轉向美京請訓、美人方面對於英代表所擬之新途徑顯抱樂觀、英方主張予日人以更多之潛艇、予美國以更大之戰艦與飛機母艦、而英國則多置巡艦、雖許日本在原則上平等、但五。五。三比率仍將保留、日政府今日已訓令松平與山本請英方說明其問題背後之意旨、查日方意見似願談判折衷辦法、英方主張列強各自單獨宣言、說明其所欲有之海軍建築、然後成立一種紳士協定、雖不言及比率、但仍以五。五。三比率為各方海軍力量之根據、</p>
<h3>三條新途徑</h3>
<p>日本宣告廢止華盛頓條約時、預料可採行之途徑、不出三種、一賡續華盛頓條約、而不加入日本、二三國各有讓步、三不立條約、第一條辦法、為美方所贊同、但英方則否、英方傾向第二條辦法、卽締結新約、一方面對日本酌予讓步、一方面仍保留比率原則是、英國之所以有此主張者、蓋以有一協定、究勝於無也、但美方能否接受此種辦法、則美代表尚未接到其政府之訓令、昨日英美代表對此第一第二兩條曾有詳細不討論、至於第三條、則僅略言梗概、而未詳加討論、</p>
<p>日本反對五。五。三制度之賡續、始終未有退讓之象、故華盛頓與倫敦海軍條約欲稍加修改、繼續有效、現似已不成問題、處此環境、惟有另議日方所可接受之新約代替之耳、美國究準備如何讓步、以迎合日人、而免造艦競爭、此乃美代表臺維斯現所欲知者、如美國不願改變其立塲、而日本亦不稍放棄其要求、則又不得不另想他法、據可恃方面消息、英美或可成立一種協定、雙方彼此不作造艦競爭、然仍在太平洋中保持其超過日方之優勢、</p>
<p>衆料下星期日方將請英方說明海軍需要、果爾、則談話將涉及更技術的性質、如美國亦參加之、則此談話將為趨向明夏海軍會議之第一步驟、</p>
<p>今日英代表赴日使署、就日方之宴會、但未談及政事、本星期六日英相麥唐納將在別墅招待美代表團、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>妥協案內容</h3>
<p>倫敦英國代表於十四日英美會談時對美提出一妥協案、其內容與對日妥協案同一觀念、然實質上依然維持五。五。三之現行比率、其大意如下、</p>
<p>（一）承認日本原則上之平等、</p>
<p>（二）片面宣言海軍實際勢力仍維持五。五。三之比率、</p>
<p>（三）對於艦種別制限加以相當改革、應各國之必要限制保有海軍力、而準許美國建造較大多型主力艦、</p>
<p>（四）規定主力艦最大噸數為三萬噸、最大備砲口徑為十四時、</p>
<p>（五）根基於上項諸點、訂立新條約、以代現行條約、（十五日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦英國方面提議主力艦之單艦噸數為二萬六千噸、備砲十二時以下、巡洋艦為七千五百噸、備砲六時以下、美國代表則主張主力艦三萬四千噸、備砲十四時、巡洋艦一萬噸、備砲八時八上、結果、關於主力艦以三萬噸程度成立妥協、（十六日電通電）</p>

<h3>地豊路上慘殺案</h3>
<p>連砍六斧唐阿坤傷重不救</p>
<p>彌留時自言兇手多係熟人</p>
<p>－慘殺原因似為販土而起－</p>
<p>滬西曹家渡地豊路第四十四號英國兵房附近嚴家宅地方、於昨晨八時二十馀分、發生一暗殺案、被害者係太倉縣公安局偵緝隊駐滬探員、事後兇手在逃未獲、茲將各情紀述如下、</p>
<h3>納再醮婦</h3>
<p>有名唐阿坤者、（又名唐永山）本地人、家住滬西星家坡路丁家庫四百九十一號平房內、妻朱氏、年三十八歲、係再醮予唐者、該婦前夫名朱新卿、乃一流氓、已於五年前去世、遺有子女各一、子名福根、年方十八、女名愛蓮、當失氏再醮與唐阿坤時、子女等亦隨之而歸唐、查唐在滬西曹家渡一帶、頗有勢力、且積資頗豊、平日與嚴家宅之販土大王嚴某有密切關係、相助一切、故與嚴姪嚴成泉更為莫逆、時常交往、惟以唐阿坤貪甚重、因此兩方、曾引起不歡、</p>
<h3>公務人員</h3>
<p>本年五月終、唐阿坤以得友人之介、充太倉縣公安局偵緝隊探員、常川駐滬辦公、但名義上雖為公務人員、而暗中仍未洗手、其出入時備有自備包車一輛、雇名蕭厚才者為車夫、昨晨七時許、唐於盆洗後卽命車夫備車、挽經嚴家宅二十一號訪問嚴成泉、及抵嚴家、則見嚴成泉方正早餐、兩人乃卽坐談片刻、約十馀分種後、嚴已膳畢、兩人卽相偕走出嚴屋、徒步向東、唐阿坤且囑其車夫在門首稍候、不必追隨、</p>
<h3>鮮血直冒</h3>
<p>詎待行至地豊路英國兵房附近、在華租交界處時、突有暴徒三名、由唐身後躍出、一持手槍、兩持利斧、一見唐阿坤、卽向其開槍一響未中、唐急轉身、則持利斧之兩暴徒、已用利斧砍來、措手不及、當被砍中頭部、立卽受創倒地、而暴徒等仍未放松、兩斧俱下、連砍六斧、齊在左右額角、致頭骨墜落、鮮血直冒、奄奄一息、勢將垂斃、兇手等見目的已逹、乃分途逃逸、但外問尚無發覺者、</p>
<h3>無法挽救</h3>
<p>幸未幾經人瞥見、乃始傅出、宣傅遠近、一時人山人海、齊往觀看、同時唐之車夫亦往觀探究竟、不料呈於眼簾者、則主人也、乃亟奔往家中報訊、唐妻朱氏聞訊、急急馳往、則靜安寺捕房及市公安局楨緝隊長盧英等、均已率探趕到、以兇手早被遠颺、乃急將唐車送海格路中國紅十安會醫院救治、終以受創過重、無法挽救、延至上午十一時三十分氣絕身死、當由該院報告捕房、將屍轉送騐屍所、待報請法院檢騐、事後並在出事地點檢獲兇手呢帽一頂、乃攜回捕房存案、</p>
<h3>身畔遣物</h3>
<p>惟當死者彌留時、靜安寺捕房探員曾向其訊問兇手面貌及服飾、據稱胥係熱人、旋以言語糢糊、不及續問、乃於事後將唐朱氏及車夫蕭厚才傅往訊問、始悉上述各情、惟捕房方面、以斯事關係華界、乃將全部供單、移往曹家渡分局辦理、死者身畔、曾抄出皮夾一只、內貯鈔洋九元、仁丹盒一只、太倉縣公安局偵緝隊部第十四號探員唐永山辦公證一紙、唐本人名片五張、及白紙數張、上印［好云］。［特云］。［云］。等字樣、經檢騐之下、乃係包藏煙土紙張、再證以朱氏所供、則唐之被殺、確為販土而起、至為明顯也、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>他心裹想著按時而去，然而他卻是按耐不得，只到五點多鐘的時候，就用平安剃刀，將鬌子括了一個干凈。頭也對著鏡子梳了又梳，最後還開著箱子，換了一件乾凈衣服。週身都收拾齊備了，看看手表，還是不到六點鐘，心裹這就想著，且不管他，先到士廉屋子裹去等候罷。不想，姓李的倒很守時刻，這時鎖了門，在茶房面前留了話，七點鐘以前準回來。賈多才來早了也不好，只得走出院子來，他曉得王家巷子，就在這小西天後門外，於是順步向後門口走了來。當這天黑未黑的時候。呌做黃昏善懷的婦女們。自古就感到這個時候，是不大受用的，因之那位月英姑娘，也未能免俗，走到大門外來望望藉解煩惱。賈多才這裹走出來，兩人正好是頂頭相撞。他見過幾回面，當然是認得，立刻紅了臉，將頭低了下去。賈多才是無所謂的，將他呆呆看了一晌，低聲道：喂！你不是約好了到那位李先生屋裹去的嗎？怎麼還不過來呢？月英見人家只管望著，本來也就有些不好意思，他這樣的平空一問，也不知道他話由何起，立刻扭轉身軀，就跑進去了。當他走的時候，似乎鼓著小腮幫子狠狠的瞪了一眼。賈多才心想，怪呀，李士廉都介紹著和我會面了，為什麼他倒對我有生氣的樣子呢？是了，必是李士廉在他們面前花了錢。若是為這點小事，那很不算什麼，賈先生也並非花不起錢的人啦。他這樣想著，不免站在後門口發呆。可是那位精明的胡家嫂子，早就在裹面看到了，立該笑嘻嘻的跑了出來向賈多才勾了兩勾頭，問道：你老不是小西天的客人嗎？（六六）</p>

<p>揚州的流水橋畔，有一俠妓李亞仙的墳墓。關於李亞仙的事情，據當地人的傅說，裹面有一段哀感頑𧰟的故事，現在且寫在下面：據說：李亞仙是明季的一個有名妓女，樹幟維揚，𧰟譽鵲起，那時恰有一個紈袴公子，經商是邦，其手下你為著討好少主起見，就把他引入青樓，意思是想使他樂而忘返，他們就好從中作弊了！果然，這公子自與李亞仙相識以後，竟是整日的躱在伊的妝閣中，不但店務不過問，就是讀書問題，也已置之腦後，雖然李亞仙曾經再三的勸他，然而他正沉溺在愛河裹，怎能夠覺悟呢？</p>
<p>未幾快到考試的時候，公子的父親，接連寫了好幾封信去催促他應試，他終是流連著不肯去。在某一天的晚上，李亞仙突然問公子說：［你為什麼這樣愛我？］公子說：［美目盼兮！巧笑情兮！］當時李亞仙聽到這話，立刻用針把眼睛戳破，並對公子說：［我不敢以兒女之愛，誤公子前程，願公子努力自愛！且我身已經屬公子，誓不他適，幸公子勿以我為念！］說完以後，她就卸了盛裝，躱到裹面房間裹，再也不肯和公子見面。</p>
<p>過了幾個月，公子聯捷直上，復回維揚，於是有情人竟成了眷屬。後來，伊死後，就葬在流水橋了！</p>
<h3>理髮店女兒</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>悄悄地，從午夜的，青色的野鴨絨枕上的夢裹醒回來的時候。那蘊藏著蜜汁的淺笑，又恍惚在憇息了的神經裹發現了。</p>
<p>是無意的走進了那家理髪店，白色門窗上旋轉著紅，白，藍－三色的標記。亦是無意的，從那些理髪匠的維揚音的稱呼中，知道那坐在最裹面的一隻座椅上，手裹正在織著紫色絨綫的姑娘，就是這理髪店的女兒。</p>
<p>伊的年紀，是從兩壁大玻璃鏡子裹給我約略估計到的，十七八歲吧？白晳的臉兒，沒有經過人工煊染的墨色眉。眸子是嘉寶的眸子，烏油油的鬢腳掩護著兩片玉琢似的耳朶。像是在什麼地方見過的呢？那最口呌人不易忘懷的成熟的櫻桃似的起著裂紋的嘴，那樣玲瓏地給安置在鷹爪鼻下面。</p>
<p>在淫慾充溢著的舞廰裹嗎？不是！在粗野意味的球塲裹嗎？不是！說不定是在一個雨後的爽朗的公園裹吧？可是我從沒有在什麼公園遇過這樣溫文的樸素的姑娘。……哦！除掉那園籬畔的帶著雨露的丁香。</p>
<p>白衣人香水和清香的蘭花皂沫給在腦杓面部塗灑的時候，伊從大玻璃鏡子裹向我這面溜好一眼。視綫跟視綫的交流，激成戀之春波。我是常常把野心扔在理智後面的，我老把一具骷髏的怕人的形態去擋住色情的襲擊。可是，當我經過伊身邊去到洗臉盆洗頭，把伊滾在地上的絨綫團扔髒，而伊反向我說［先生，嚇了你吧。］的時候。我確實幾乎失去了一切理智的靈感。</p>
<p>［不會髒得織不上去吧？嘿嘿…］我致歉意地對伊說，邊在探著濕頭髪。</p>
<p>［就是髒也瞧不出來的，這是紫色的絨綫呢！］櫻桃裂開的一剎那，蜜汁的淺笑在跟著飛迸出來。一束含著柔態的丁香浸潤在晨露裹面笑著溫和的陽光。</p>
<p>可是，正在午夜呵，剪短了頭髪的腦杓是最神經質的，想起白天理髪店的姑娘的神采，就是柔軟的青色的野鴨絨枕上亦不允許我再入夢了。</p>
<h3>葛公子</h3>
<p>— 華嬰</p>
<p>我和葛公子交游已有數年了。但是他是何許人氏。我從未問起過。而他的性情。我卻明白得不要明白了。</p>
<p>他為人第一是爽氣。銀錢簡真只當草紙用。只要誰拍他幾句馬屁。他自會把腰包裹的銷票麥克麥克的拿出來請客。所以總是他會鈔的日子多。但是他的朋友卻不多。簡直寥若晨星。連我在內也不過三四位吧了。</p>
<p>我因為到南京去躭擱了半年多。就一直沒碰見遇。現在我已回到上海。我也沒閒去拜訪他。在某一夜於馬路上不期的遇見他。才知道他已搬了塲。略敷衍了幾句，也就別了。</p>
<p>一日。他忽然打電話邀我到ＸＸ酒店去飲酒。我如時前往。他已等得不耐煩。並已獨喝了好多盅酒了。他以前向來不喝酒。現在酒量突然放大。我不禁驚訝的問他道：</p>
<p>［你怎麼現在也喝酒啦？］</p>
<p>他微笑笑。半年沒曾和他一起過。他的確變了。並且話也不多說了。但是看他那喝酒之態。大有百杯不醉之概。宛似當年太白之風。我雖然和他對酌著。可亦不知說什麼好。就一直沉默到喝完了二瓶陳年花彫。他這纔說道：</p>
<p>［人生行樂耳。喝喝酒，睡睡覺，真真幸福也！］</p>
<p>我的確不明白他變得是如何模樣。並且何為如此灰心。我真莫從明白起。他的性情向來明白得不要明白。現在可跟他被交似的。茫然不知了。</p>
<p>直到跑出酒樓。他又說了一句：［再會吧！］</p>
<p>我茫然的望著他的背影消失在人潮中…………。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （克威）</p>
<p>冷天，在街上，只看見人們向那曬著陽光的一邊走，沒有陽光的一邊便變得非常冷落，由此，可測騐到人的心理都是愛趨炎附勢的！</p>
<p>小園藝</p>
<h3>水果在山東</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>水菒，雖是由於天然出產，但是也須要人工的培養和種植，結出來的鮮菒，方有優美的成績，滋味鮮永，氣質芬芳，既大又多，方纔可以使人歡愛。近來國際貿易，一天盛似一天。歐美各國，把出產的水菒，大量運銷我國，一年的漏巵，何止數百萬元，就是美橘一項，據海關統計，半年進口的數量，已足以驚人。何況還有別種的水菒，所以這水菓一物，年來也成了一種重要的生產，不可忽視的了。</p>
<p>水菒的種類極多，不下百馀種，有同是一種水菓，因了產地的不同，滋味便絕對的兩樣，因此水菓的產地，卻須絕端的注意。在我國生產的水菓，凡是聞名全國的幾種，大都以產地而名，這就是這一種水菓，必須在這一處地方出產的，方是鮮美可口，這大約是地質的不同，和種類的相異，纔有這一種的景象。我國山東一省之中，各地所出產的水菓，大半是名聞全國，是不可多得的美味，別一省份，雖也有出產有名的水菓地方。但是總沒有似山車省內的多而有名，所以可以說我國出產的水菓，是在山東省。</p>
<p>肥城桃　肥城出的桃子，便呌做肥城桃，怕不說是誰？只要是蒈過肥城桃的人，到了桃子出市的時候，總得紀念著吧。在肥城所出產的肥城桃，質量的巨大，竟出人意料之外，有同飯碗口大的一個，重量可以有半斤，其巨大便可想而知了。滋味的鮮甜清香，一上口便順口流汁，可以在皮外鑽了個小洞，用口吮吸，把桃汁吸盡，只剩了一層桃皮，和一個桃核，顏色也十分好看，玉色帶著硃砂點子，可惜這種肥城桃，不容易存放，所以南方很不易嘗到。</p>
<p>萊陽梨　提起了萊陽梨，誰都可以知道是梨中最佳的一種。甜而鮮潔，嫩而爽口，在梨的一類中，怕沒有再勝過的了。這一種梨，便是出在山東的萊陽縣境，就呌作萊陽梨。到了秋天，水菓店中，都得懸起了招牌，寫著萊陽梨上市，作為號召，這種梨的有名，也可想而知了。</p>
<p>德州西瓜　山東一省，出產西瓜的地方很多，可是最有名的，祇有德州所產的一種，西瓜的式樣，是一種枕頭形，俗名便呌枕頭瓜，顏色有紅，黃，白，三種，以紅的為多，而且最好，重量在十馀斤二十斤之間，瓜汁豊富，其甜如蜜，是一種不可多得的美味。可惜這種德州瓜，移咱在別地之後，瓜味便變了，大約是因為土質的關係吧，因出產不多，求多於供，價錢也不十分便宜，都要少至半元一個，不是尋常的貧民，可以嘗到的東西。</p>
<p>玫瑰葡萄　玫瑰葡萄，出產在煙臺，因味道帶著一股玫瑰香氣，所以呌做玫瑰葡萄。顏色是紫得十分鮮艷，每一枝上，結著如墜珠般的數十個葡萄，十分可愛，菓皮是異常的柔薄，吃在口內，一些不夾雜著酸味，只覺得一陣玫瑰香味，直透腦門，又甜如蜜糖，比較了美國運來的洋葡萄，勝過百倍。在煙臺一帶的山地，種植玫瑰葡萄的人，不知多少，因此出產也多，國產葡萄酒和葡萄汁的原料，很多是從煙臺採辦，凡是用玫瑰葡萄做原料所製的葡萄酒和汁，比了在河南省出產的葡萄做原料的，滋味的相差，不可以道里計了。</p>
<p>烟台蘋菓　煙臺除了葡萄之外，還出產蘋菓，在南方不論那一處水菓店中，總可以看到煙臺蘋菓的市招，自然也是一種有名的產物了。顏色比了金山蘋菓清雅而好看，滋味也甜而清香，不似金山蘋菓船的酸涩。</p>
<p>以上的幾種，都是在山東省內，頗頗有名的水菓，也是名聞全國的美味，除此之外，水菓的出產，各處都有，只不似以上的幾種有名而味美罷了。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>但是無論如何，太后卻並不曾有過半些不合意的表示，伊顯然是很滿足了。</p>
<p>太后在便殿上略坐一坐之後，但決意要午睡了：伊每次午睡的時間，總在兩三小時左右，今天伊尤比往常多辛苦了一些，那末睡的時間，也許會格外長些了。伊睡熟了之後，我們便照例只讓一個恰巧該當值的人留著，專候伊醒來時給伊呼喚：其馀的七個人，都一起退出來休息。方才我所說的兩座偏殿，便是我們這八位女官的官舍。因為大家都已累得很吃力的緣故，竟不遑再作他想，怱怱都進官舍去歇息了。我自己當然也很疲倦，但這個新環境已給予我以一重極濃烈的刺激，使我的神經，非常興奮，絕對不用想合上眼睡覺，因此，我就爽快丟下了午睡的念頭，一個人在外面的長廊裹逗留著，打算再把這裹一帶的景象，認識得更清楚些。然而我也不敢走得太遠，也許太啟突然會醒了，或者一醒來就想到我，指名要我去給伊斡什麼事情，這是誰也不敢斷其必無的；所以我便只能老是這條長廊下徘徊著，盡我的目力所及，望各處眺覽。雖當我所能眺覽到的只是一部份的宮院，但我已於此得到了一個大概，可以用幾句很簡單的話來說明這些宮院的建築方式。第一，它有很多的庭院，每個庭院的三面或四面，必有許多宮殿環繞著；第二，在這些宮殿的外面，又必有一條互相連緊著的長廊，彼此好兜轉；這樣一起一起的合併攏來，便成為一座小小的迷宮的格式了。當然，這種建築方式對於我，已不再會引起什麼特殊的注意了。（一七六）</p>

<h3>紗花外商繼續拋出標紗</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、因外商繼續賣出、檯面鬆動、同時現紗客銷較滯、人心稍軟、但某公司之多額、收貨與否、尚未定奪、惟有一部份決意收貨、所以市面仍在醖釀中、</p>
<p>金鷄跌八九角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉平疲、而日商繼續拋出、以致市勢虛弱、塲中賣風較熾、各月跌七八九角至一元二角、午後開盤、市情仍疲、但有一部份空頭獲利抵補、各月均漲一二三四角、全日成交統計二萬九千三百包、查賣出大豊三千包、逹記八百包、振大四百五十包、元德九百包、仁豊五百五十包、長豊一千一百包、潤康五百包、永昌四百五十包、惠康六百包、慎記六百包、同興五百五十包、元泰五百包、買進吉豊八百包、同興五百五十包、元泰五百包、買進吉豊八百包、穗降八百包、源大五百包、錦昌一千三百包、明德五百包、賡豊一千六百包、益昶七百五十包、德記五百五十包、長豊一千包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>華北棉產估計增加標花人氣愈軟化</h3>
<p>棉市趨跌、形勢漸現鬆動、因全國棉產二次估計發表、華北年景豊收、產量增加、致人心愈弱、同時現棉銷路益覺岑寂、本月份有漢口粗絨交貨說、但究屬如何、尚待事實證明、</p>
<p>鄭標又跌三角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因全國棉產估計豊收、而美棉平平、致人心軟弱、塲中賣氣略熾、各月跌三。四角、午後市況仍平、近漲一角半、馀月平平、全日成交統計九萬二千四百擔、查賣出通記二千擔、昌記一千擔、大豊三千擔、源大一千七百擔、明德二千七百擔、慎記一千七百擔、仁豊二千九百擔、元德一千一百擔、義成一千擔、潤康二千擔、德記一千擔、新寧一千二百擔、長和六千五百擔、買進大孚三千六百擔、昶記一千三百擔、恒德三千九百擔、義成一千一百擔、益昶一千三百擔、長豊一千二百擔、恒昌一千三百擔、長和四千四百擔、大豊二千九百擔、賡豊四千六百擔、長馀一千三百擔、源興昌二千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>原棉廠需更寂</p>

<p>天津美種花　五五。二五　上海廠進　一五五件　現貨送廠</p>
<h3>本月份上半月本市華日紗銷量統計</h3>
<p>據日商調查、十一月上旬中上海華日紗消費出口量、日紗運往各地二千君百三十八包、比前旬之五千八百七十二包減少二千君百三十四包、華紗銷數一萬五千零三十七包、比前旬之二萬二千三百八十三包減少七千三百四十六包、查華日紗減少之原因、謂匯兌暴落、輸往海外無利、茲將華日紗輸往各地之量額列下、（單位包）</p>

<h3>滬棉商拋出三月份美棉</h3>
<p>紐約棉市狹小而恍惚、交易尚屬活躍、開盤時上海商人拋售三月份、為勢頗猛、加以套賣不絕、市價下降、入後利物浦與同業買進、投機家亦有相當購置、價格回堅、股市與小麥之挺秀亦屬有益、近收盤時多頭獲利了結、收盤安靜、現貨仍緊、但需要遲緩、紗布市況平靜、計現貨漲五磅音、期貨漲跌一至三磅音、英棉期貨不動、印棉因利物浦消息良好、及塲中操業者買進而昂、計平果爾漲一羅比、奧姆辣及白羅溪漲二角半、原電錄左、（十五日電）</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥市氣萎靡</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份先挺後跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲四五角左右、坎拿大漲三角左右、故開份時、近期市面、曾俏起半分、惟屢開屢跌、形勢至見軟弱、因本月份實銷不動、業外多頭、紛紛回出、遠期各月份、亦因業外需要、已見冷淡、內地幫購買、亦轉停寂、致各月份市價、各較小一分左右、迨至下午開盤、以業外多頭仍有湧出、本月份方面、兼有套頭交易、聞有放棄之說、致人心愈益不振、遠期則浮空拋壓、廠方又有略出、故全局一致鬆跌也、結果本月份較跌二分半、十二月份跌二分七厘半、一月份跌二分二厘半、二月份跌二分、三月份跌二分半、四月份跌一分七厘半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤時、人心尚穩、迨後因業內外買氣況寂、市氣略現疲弱、兼之粉市堅而轉跌、開價遂見鬆動、迨至下午開盤、市氣之有瀉落之象、以粉市因實銷之不振、一再回跌、致小麥市塲、亦因賣氣之盛、跌勢漸狂、終之此後情形、一方須看外匯之長縮、一方須看實銷如何也、結果本月份較前日跌八分、十二月份跌七分、一月份跌五分、二月份跌七分、三月份跌七分、現麥市面、高貨未開、中關貨微有鬆動、計小二三分、開山東白麥三元八角八分、紅麥三元八角四五分、徐州麥三元八角四分、計一萬包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>支另哥麥市、人心看漲、一般重行購買、空頭亦從事補進、所有浮多了結均被吸進、阿根廷消息自相矛盾、西南區繼續乾燥、價格好起一分半、玉米則隨小麥而上升、又訊、市況因巴爾斡半島謠言及缺乏賣戶而漲、但買者之範圍能否擴大、性質能否持久、尚待證明、同時在背後須知國外雜糧仍有進口之可能、且成交不多、</p>
<p>芝加哥小玫十一月十四日收盤十一月十五日收盤上落　十二月份　九九。六二五　一○一。○○　漲一。三七五　五月份　九九。一二五　一○○。三七五　漲一。二五　七月份　九三。七五　九五。二五　漲一。五○</p>

<h3>河米漸有回疲狀</h3>
<p>（滬南）各情來源三十馀號、貨共四千七八百石、開手即軟、作客蒞市者既稀、形勢珠覺清寂、零躉兩日實屬平淡、惟以內地身本見重、售方扳做殊力、因之結果各厚粳及晚稻、僅修數分至角許耳、杜洋尖銷化不呆、步落近尺、獨陰元賴酒戶動動、再見挺秀、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路內地到貨二十五六號、河存一百四五十艘、市上各種銷胃、新粳薄稻新羊杜尖去胃續有、陳白元陰元零拆略交、破粳新陳埠客尖平常、市形新粳破新羊杜尖陳白元陰元新陳埠客尖價形定局、惟早薄稻平疲、</p>
<h3>洋米內地去化仍旺</h3>
<p>昨日洋米現貨、本客去化轉活、內地除浙幫繼續收辦外、新有無錫幫到市問津、而貨主嫌小扳價、價乃立漲五分、一號西貢開二千五百包、價至十一元四角、暹邏元米三千包、價至十一元八角四分、安南粳一千七百包、價至十一元九角、期貨新交易尚未議妥、回籠貨亦見喊高、共開五百噸、客秈到頭略減、內地幫問津洋米後、客秈胃口略淡、適販戶以成本昂大、意在喊高、故統市只開一千五六百包云、</p>
<p>前日洋商拋三月份小絞價祇五元一角、惟須三千噸方可定實、而進戶方面只有二千多噸進胃、致未妥洽、即裝西貢洋商允以五元一角二分之價售出、亦以定額不足作罷、因此市上只有回籠貨開出、計暹邏二百噸、三月份西貢一百噸、暹邏定價如前、西貢已大至五元三角、較大三分、小絞回籠二月份二百噸價五元零五分、三月份一百噸價五元一角、市均轉站、因洋商拋貨未成故也、現洋米因內地胃呆、市乃轉平、共開西貢安南暹邏各米二千五百六十五包、湘米二千包、漢口糙砶一千八百包、沙市糙二千包、均由內地本街分去、市價與前出入甚微、</p>
<h3>紅糧續俏黃豆步升</h3>
<p>前日紅糧市面依然飛俏、因產價有榮無辱、來源寥寥、昨抵兩輪、祇有五車、且為解交前拋之期貨、惟於上午回出一車、價開三元五角九、行情比前市漲四分、午後買方搜求見急、續由收方割讓半車、價作三元六角半、一日之間、又漲六分、路貨成交一星期交一車、價為三元四角九、二星期交二車、價三元五角二、又二三天交安東紅殼糧一車、價做三元六角七分、黃豆因皖省抽災捐之故、致火車豆來源不接、近日祇輪運之河南豆及大連牛荘漢口等貨、但因產價提高、到貨亦少、所以市況步挺、昨市頴州陳豆已開三元三角、各種新豆已開三元外、昨成交新豆、十二三車、陳豆二十車左右、行情均漲五六分、去路陳豆由廠家辦去、新豆由本街及錫常等走化云、</p>
<h3>油市豆油花生油繁需市俏</h3>
<p>近日豆油及花生油市況頗呈活潑、原因豆價高漲、人心向榮、且產地存貨不湧、河道封凍日近、而本市底積亦少、各幫去路、尚不弱、市價乃見步緊矣、昨成交各種花生油一百七十件、行情漲二角、豆油成交輪船大連油三百件、輪船牛荘油一百件、輪船沙河岐山油三百件、沙船牛荘油五十件、大有馀廠五十件、各種豆油新開出之行情、較前續漲一角、</p>
<h3>糖市　新片青開十元</h3>
<p>粗砂白日見下游</p>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢依然疲弱、交易寥寥、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨普通十八元四角半、僅成交五十包、比前日降去五分、轉口貨呌五元一角半、小去五分、亦未成交、八九號荷赤高貨sy嘜成交數十包十四元二角、轉口貨稍見持硬、呌四元八角半、本廠綿白平定、振記一號十六元六角、二號十六元四角、三號十六元二角、四號十六元、前日所到新片青昨已見樣、由廣幫號家開出百馀、小箱價為十元、建幫新到大包水三十馀包、分蜜色白色兩種、因價不合、尚未成盤、五福四水今日可有續到、據號家口氣、必須增價方肯開兌、</p>
<h3>南北貨川榨菜市價鬆落</h3>
<p>四川榨菜、近日已銷令已過、去胃減少、市勢逐步見軟、如上荘貨已降至十八元許、普通僅十六元、本街有零星交易、客幫走塲亦乏大宗、客貨開價、漸見鬆落、蓋現呈供過於求（如乏大宗去胃、極難轉好耳、）</p>
<h3>金針菜成交不多</h3>
<p>金針菜近日開出不多、到銷亦少、昨客貨僅開出普通毫州菜三十五包、價十三元半、蓋貨品較次故耳、銷方大都零星交易而已、行盤尖色頂荘菜為十九元至十八元半、大興菜十七元半、仰花菜十六元半、宿遷菜十六元、徐州菜十六元至十五元半、普通貨十五元左右不一、</p>
<h3>疋頭真馬褲呢已至八洋一碼</h3>
<p>馬褲呢日來市銷更旺、真正一零零五之貨、供不敷求、存貨漸缺、大路售盤因之節節上漲、德記。魯麟。禮和。怡和等諸牌、躉批一律躍漲至八元凈盤、門市裁縫零剪為八元二三角、孔士一零零為八元八角、箱子喊八元四角半、居存者尚希、雜牌假貨一零零五馬褲呢、大半但售六元零些、大新街一帶西服舖子、以此投機號召、其實真正一零零五馬褲呢大衣一件、需料二碼七五、照現市最低價需費洋四十元上下、二十馀元一件、不難知其為真為假矣、</p>

<h3>藝術的形式和遺產的一點補充</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>野先生對於［藝術的形式和遺產］的異議，在其他的各點上，似於我們並沒不同的意見：可是在古典的現實主義作家的世界觀和創作方法的矛盾的［解法］上，我們的意見顯然地是相反的了。這一點我覺得還有簡單地說明一下的必要。</p>
<p>古黃作家的世界觀和創作方法的矛盾，其實並非［解決］了的，這乃是在某種程度上克服。而對於問題，野先生認為是社會變動的所致。</p>
<p>可是在我的意見，則認為說這種相當的克服，是由於作家的創作的實踐之結果，這話並沒有錯處。為什麼呢？</p>
<p>我們知道藝術和科學是有著牠們的同一性和異性的。藝術和科學同樣地是現象的晉遍化，然而，科學是藉抽象的概念，藝術卻藉具體的形象。正因為這一點，藝術較之別的科學，對於現實有著更為密切的直接的聯緊，就是說，藝術之受現實的影響，較之別的科學，來得直接。可是，這種影響，只是存在於現實中的一種可能性。為什麼在許多古典作家中，單有巴爾扎克，托爾斯泰諸人能夠受取這種影響，而違背他們的世界觀，創出在某種程度上是現實的藝術作品來呢，這是因為他們受了寫實主義　他們採取了寫實主義的方法去創作，深刻地觀察現實，綜合現實，才成就的。而這，分明是指示著：他們在創作的過程中去克服他們的世界觀。我以為野先生在這一點上是抹煞了藝術家的實踐。</p>
<h3>讀書</h3>
<p>— 煥明</p>
<p>在他的［徒然的篤學］裹，鶴見佑輔，慨歏著那位從事歷史的阿克敦卿（lordacton）。那位徒然的篤學者，在盛開著橄欖花的地中海岸一帶，讀了一輩子的書：在事業上卻遠不如早死的理查格林，和薄命的賴山陽：他竟不能像這二位比他在世界上逗留得短促多的人似的遺下些使後起青年奮起的功績。</p>
<p>於是他認為這簡直是悲劇了。</p>
<p>讀書確是會讀出悲劇來的。同是一本書，攤在讀書方法眼光不同的二個人眼前，影響是不會同的。他們的利害，全在看讀這書的人能否去避免什麼；或是能否找到內中有益的真諦來。</p>
<p>在培根的［論學］（of　study）裹，法蘭西斯他認為讀書是用以消遣，修飾，增加才智的。嚴格的說起來，前二點該是比較虛空消極；雖也該承認他的存在，但那是遠不如和緘點來得重要了。讀書的目的不該是欣賞或攀弄風月，讀進去的書也不是專用於人前的修飾，讀書該是按著步驟的進展來開闢個人生活合理的途徑；開闢社會的合理途徑的。</p>
<p>像亞克敦卿那樣的讀書人，不能和船夫出身的高爾基樣的能寫，能拿事業出來貢獻給人類，豈是偶然的嗎：不能離開書本子，讀些活的書籍；體騐，觀察，創造活的事物，卽使讀了再多幾車的書，又有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>有一個研究哲學得碩士學位的人，因為只知讀哲學，只知尊敬書裹的話的緣故，他的思想脫離人生了：他拿了那些從人生中演繹歸納出來的理論，疾視冷笑起人生來。於是一個三十來歲的年青人便流露了使人瞧了惋惜的瘋狂樣子。我聆聽他的談吐，並找不出絲毫尖銳的見解來。當我和他談到現實的事物時，他只喃喃地加了些不可理解的咀咒。像這樣的人，豈不也是讀出悲劇來的一個嗎？</p>
<p>許多讀書人是像浮萍似的，書本有如一陣風，風吹到那裹，浮萍被帶到那裹；有時彷彿也像長下了根，但在這種情形下，仍不免繼續那種渺茫的飄浮的。這種態度，彷彿幽默的蕭也不很贊同：</p>
<p>［世間最不行的是讀書人，因為讀書人只知別人的思想和藝術，而不能用自己的。］</p>
<p>這豈單是蕭那老孩子偶然的牢騷嗎？</p>
<p>單把自己閉門讀到的書編成個圈子，拋開一切現實，或除掉自己信仰人的意見之外毫無主觀的滲進－用這樣的圈子去套世界，去咀咒，去頌揚，該是太簡單些吧？讀書不單讀鉛字排的，去留意那些無形的書也是重要的：不僅如此，還該用客觀用主觀去探索洞悉一切事物的靈魂精髓。才是最理想的。能把讀到的變成身上的毛或皮雖不是最壞的事情，但把每一頁每一頁都成了［自己的］血和肉豈不是更重要嗎？</p>
<p>把讀書看得像結婚樣嚴重的，該就是悲劇的一部分由來吧。然而咬著雪茄，坐在沙發上［欣賞］的讀書人。在人類積極的立塲看去，他們的本身豈不也是社會上的徒然的篤學者嗎？一個讀書人，只知讀書，或只知照書上的道理做人，忘了世界，或使世界忘了他－實在的，他沒有得益，非但無益，並且有害；非但害了他自己，並且往往是會害了人類的。</p>
<h3>旅途</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>西天的最後一綫陽光，在人們不留意中。鑽進山坳中去了，地面上緊跟著刮起傍晚的涼風，緊跟著揭出傍晚模糊的薄幕。雀鳥們爭先恐後飛回窠巢，好像再遲一步牠們就會把生命埋葬在眼前黑暗的深淵裹似的。牠們吱吱家家的呌著，我猜到是在互道著晚安，在互相談論白天裹所遭遇著的事情。對於我這歸不得家的路人說，是在給我示威呢。中、蛟虫，也許有別樣說不出各的不虫，牠們雖然說不到是喜歡黑暗的，至少牠們是倚仗在黑暗中的活動著的，這時，在向我的面上猛撲，猛啃，好像我是一個富翁，牠們是一羣胡子，看中我是一聲肥肉。不，我這種假想，隨即證明出是錯誤的：不只是我一個人，車夫還有和我同坐一車的人，都在遭受同樣的包圍。</p>
<p>天邊上是紅的，紅的晚霞像一朶一朶的鮮花；人家煙囱裹冒出的炊煙是灰的，是輕飄飄的，一陣濃一陣稀，最後到天空中漫遊去；我們三個人是疲倦的，車子一天儘走些山路，路上崎嶇不平，顛箥得非常厲害，我敢擔保，如果我們之中有一個女人，又在懷著身孕，那她隆起的肚子，很容易的就會平復下去的。馬也沒精力了，只消看那種懶散樣子，就是一個明證。和人一樣，馬也要設法防衛蚊虫的攻擊，尾巴就是剿蚊的武器，不時在上下左右搖動著，往身上捶擊。</p>
<p>天要黑了，但是離開我們停宿的小鎮，還有五六里的路程，車夫為的要快趕路，在馬身上加著鞭子，我們乘客的心裹，比馬的腳步還要快上三倍。</p>
<p>眼前的景物，漸漸的模糊得不能分辨了，天邊，嶺頂和地面已經染上了一色的黑暗。</p>
<p>［快］。</p>
<p>姓張的乘客催促著車夫，因為他身中帶著一百多塊錢，他怕在這投黑路上遇到意外。</p>
<p>［是要快的，老客，我比你還心急。］</p>
<p>車夫說完話，又在馬身上加了幾鞭。</p>
<p>三四年沒有走這條路，路上還是同樣不能使人放下驚懼的膽子，走在路上的人，總要提防一種意外的遭遇。尤其是這一時，更比前些年荒亂；為了反抗［滿洲國］的統治政策，一些不明真相的隊伍，時常在鄉間出沒，屬於仁義隊伍的，不搶不劫，自然不少；趁火打刧的也實在很多。</p>
<p>白天，我就在觀察著沿路的情形，我為的要找尋出今昔不同的所在，可是，我的眼睛沒有給我完成這種企圖。以前的國旗，自然我是不能看到的，就是現在［滿洲國］的五色旗，也找不出一面；這是鄉間，鄉間人對於國家的觀念，原就輕如淡水，他們管得什麼國旗不國旗的。褪了色，殘破不全的春聯，在家家戶戶門口貼著，依然是些［天下太平］，［五榖豐收］的句子。人，照舊在田中作著流汗的工作，狗也同從前一樣知道找尋樹蔭下去假寐，一面從口裹往外淌著口沫；孩子們提著水罐子在田滕上往來也是從前看過的。山丘，河流，都讓我清清楚楚認出來保持原位沒什麼變動。（未完）</p>
<h3>自然界－和一個人</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作方土人譯</p>
<p>小山有趣地環繞著，一若它們那軟性的輪廓是由關心到風景的美的人們的手腕所造成的一樣，人們在那山水中間安排著他們小小的舊式的市鎮－－多色的小小的家屋的一個稠密的會合。這些小山活像在裝作一個有浪漫傾向的藝術家。一個歌特式教堂的尖塔從這些小山當中的一峰向上凸出，好像一支一發必中標的箭；人類的住所，木頭和石頭的立體的建築物，像階梯樣沿著另外一座山腰隆落下面的山谷。在這澄清的土鴿色的天空裹，太陽俯臨市鎮矻然昇騰。它那凈白的閃光，已經放射著黎明時分的粉紅的色彩，雖然它的射綫不過才流瀉一綫微弱的光照著這塊耕種過的可可色的土壤，和冬季用以覆地的那帶如絲的綠葉。仔細地滾平過了的一條路從市鎮通到山下，一直通到山谷為止。兩匹古銅色的巨大的馬，由一個穿著深藍色服裝的，身材很相稱的人牽引著，沿著這條路前進；一個高高的黑衣婦人跟著他們走來，她的背上馱著很重的籃子，腰馱得變下來了。在這條直路上守護著的是兩列古樹，它們小小的枝條很仔細地被修剪過了的。還沒有萌芽呢，而且似乎決不會萌芽了吧，一直到他們壽命的盡頭，這些古樹也依然不會有葉子的吧，全身都蓋著粗糙的節疤，像瘤腫一樣壓著枝斡。在這田野中間配合得很美麗的是小小的叢村，已經戴滿淺藍色的嫩葉了，溫和的春天的微風使它們沙沙作響，引起了一種錯覺，以為這些樹木正在原野上運動著呢。它們當中有幾株確靠近鐵路園堤。彌滿了泥土的潮濕的甘甜的氣味的風，搖動著它們，好像在計算著它們的嫩葉。太陽的光綫在枝斡中間遊戲，想來是正在營巢吧，</p>
<p>在這里不禁喚起了對於已經在大地上為他們自己安排得這般舒適而成功了的人類肅然起敬的心情。</p>
<p>從一根粗枝上吊著一個人，他的腳差不多要接觸到圍堤了。這是一個非常可憐的人！！縊死他的這根硬繩索是用粗細不同的兩根繩子絞了起來的。繩結，在他的頭上看起來像是一隻大的灰色的蜘蛛。這個人將他的兩臂伸得和他衣服的綫縫平行，像一個立正姿勢的小兵；手指頭放在他那寬大的破褲子中間看不見。布滿了石灰的污點的一件厚短褂，在胸口張開著，似乎會從他那下垂的肩上滑稅下來一樣；他的灰色的襯衫在頸部張開著。暴露著他那腹部的微微比較來得不大灰褐的皮膚，他的褲腰落下，太陽照著一簇淡紅色的毛。這個人的頭萎垂在他的胸膛和右肩中間；一顆淺藍色的禿髪的斑點反映著太陽。他的左耳留神地向著天空登起；凸出著的右眼冷酷地注視著右腳上的齪齪的鞋子！！腳後跟吊起，大足趾從皮鞋裹的一個洞突出，像從一隻非常老的物動的㿜嘴裹伸出來的一塊肉。</p>
<h3>功成身退</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>江湖客（九）</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>接連豪飲以後，暫時間停下來。手指叩著桌邊，那雙小而閃著狡黠的眼睛充著血絲，滯澀的定在小小的磴熖上。已經將小二忘記了。仲秋節前後的日子，該思念家了罷。</p>
<p>提起他的家，是個難解的謎。小二以將近十載的情誼問過他，只說離家三十年了。三十年中沒有回去過，恐怕死也要在外鄉。至於家中還有誰，他僅以意味深長的搖頭作為回敬，過後總有兩天不多說話。所以近兩年來，小二從不提到這事。他也許在本土是一個路刦兇漢，也許是目無國法的大盜，也許遭了家破人亡的浩難或因妻子偷人之怒之下，殺了奸夫淫婦：出奔他鄉。起伏的雙肩微坍，尚殘存些許當年風韻；有那小而圓的眼睛，仍有未遏的光熠耀。年青時，總該是個稀有的壯漢。雖然他已是不可挽救的老衰了。背已屈駝。</p>
<p>他的臉紫漲已經褪下，單賸下了灰敗。顋巴子　的耳際，像無數小山嶺橫亙在那裹。</p>
<p>［不錯，朋友……］他欠起半個身，以那釘鈀似的手抓住杯子。［乾乾……你知道，我總有三十年沒有和別人一道胡鬧過，今兒，我輸了。］</p>
<p>這話是靠不住的，因為他每天晚上都和小二有一次兇酒，竟至於把眼淚弄出來。每屆這時，他的話也就愈難辨角。對乎也許懂得的，小二扮了個嘴臉，飲了他敬送的一杯。</p>
<p>［哎，這就是良心，良心！好，來乾乾。］</p>
<p>［良心生在屁股上，是罷？］</p>
<p>［不！］</p>
<p>他搖著多毛的頭，帽沿索索響著。酒潑湔在前胸上。</p>
<p>［可是，你說的哪！］</p>

<p>在發射機或接收機上所用的電源變壓器，屏壓若嫌過低，可將副圈部分中未用的絲極線圈（filanent　winding）與輸入電源的正圈串連之，因此，絲極線圈的誘導電壓加入於正圈，使正圈間的電壓卽自動升高；則副圈部分中屏壓圈，隨正圈電壓及圈數比例而增高。其增高的電壓數量，可用下列公式下計算之：</p>
<p>式中vp為電源輸入電壓，vf為絲極圈電壓，vs1為原定屏極圈電壓，vs2為原定屏極圈電壓及所增電壓之和。</p>
<p>檢定線圈在串接時的方向有否錯誤，可將一高壓交流電表並接於屏壓兩極，乃串接絲壓圈於正圈，清參看附圖。如見電壓表上數值較未串接時的加增，則這接的方向是沒有錯誤，否則須將兩接頭對調之。</p>
<p>副圈部分中絲壓圈，可與正圈串聯者不限定以一個二個及二個以上串接之均可。惟須使電源變壓器不受遇高荷載，致毀中間絕線物。</p>
<p>在市電升高或降落易變化之處，應用此法以節制電源電壓，不必另外用一電鈴變壓器等，便利多了，同志們不仿試之。</p>
<h3>6Ｆ7的經濟交流兩管機</h3>
<p>— 吳英劍</p>
<p>自從新式真空管行世以後，一般業馀家多利用多極的新式真空管，做成各種單管機。在本刋亦已介紹過多張綫路。成績方面確是不差，收聽本埠各電臺，均能在揚聲器內放聲，足供多人之如樂。作者亦曾以6Ｆ7複作用真空管作一單管機，以五極部份為檢波，三極部份為低放，雖然亦能放聲於揚聲器，但是音量總嫌不大，後來改成了如左圖的綫路：</p>
<p>以三極部份作檢波，五極部份作低放，音量增加了不少。因為乾電不經濟，又怕時時掉換，繞制變壓器亦很麻煩，所以就設計用直接電源。真空管絲極電壓取自電阻降低，這樣要經濟不少。</p>
<p>綫路中地綫沒有繪出。因為用直接電源最好能不用地綫，如果要用地綫，則地綫回路中必須接一只ＩＭＦＤ的固定電容器，否則有觸電及燒壞真空管之危險。電源部份如省去一級濾波亦可。不過用二級濾波交流聲可減少些。又在整流管Ｖr陰極與絲極間接一只○。五ＭＦＤ固定電容器，交流聲亦能減少，可以一試。綫路中的零件說明於右：</p>

<h3>燈絲開關之討論</h3>
<p>— 汪盛世</p>
<p>凡是直流收音機，不管是多少燈的，都有一隻燈絲開關，去控制燈絲的絲壓。因為每一種真空管都有他的最高絲壓，假使所加的電壓超遇這值，燈絲就有燒斷的危險。初玩無綫電的讀者們，大約有不少犯過這毛病吧？</p>
<p>就Ａ一○九真空管而討論，他的絲壓是一至一。三弗打。但是普通一個乾電池有一。五弗打，所以必須另一個耗阻去壓低他，通常壓低的方法有後面三種：</p>
<p>一在燈絲電路內加一適當的固定耗阻，再另用一開關以司開閉。但是電池的電壓要逐漸降低，所以這固定耗阻也要時常更換，麻煩得很，因此採用的很少。（圖一）</p>
<p>二用變量電阻（rheostat）以司調節。這法固然很好，但是也有他的缺點，就是究竟要開多少，沒有一定的標準。卽使旋鈕上有了箭頭，偶不留意，亦易失誤。尤其是家中多小孩的，高興起來，跑去任意玩弄，尤易發生損壞。（圖二）</p>
<p>三用變量電阻兼用開關。先把變量電阻Ｒ開至適當的位置，固定不動，以後專用Ｓ以司開閉。但是這時Ｒ仍能轉動，假使不聽的時候，有人把他轉動過，以後不加視察，貿然卽將開關閉合，燈絲即有燒斷之危險。（圖三）</p>
<p>以上三種，都不是完美的方法，常易發生毛病。近來我把第二法稍加改進，可把以上各弊一掃而空。所以寫出來給各位讀書做參考。</p>
<p>現在市上旋鈕大都是膠木做的，這裹卻要一個木質的。約一時直徑者最好。用一隻半時長的銅螺絲釘鑽於側面，如圖四。將此旋鈕套於變量電阻旋軸，把小螺絲Ｂ轉緊，使固定於軸上。然後把他旋轉，使裹面銅片恰至適當的位置，（卽此時燈絲中受到規定的電壓），於是在面板上再鑽一隻螺釘Ｃ如圖五，恰在Ａ的旁邊，把Ａ擋住。卽就使Ａ祇能在極小的範圍ＡＤ內旋轉，換一句話說，就是燈絲所受的電壓永遠不能超過一個限度了。</p>
<p>若是電池的電壓逐漸在降低，絲壓已嫌不足，那末可以先把Ｂ旋鬆，掀住裹面的銅片，將旋鈕逆時針方向轉動少許，再把Ｂ轉緊。現在再開到Ａ和Ｃ兩隻螺釘軋住的時候，裹面的銅片已經多轉了一段距離，就是燈絲電壓比較剛才已經增加少許了。照這樣的方法，可以隨時把絲壓加大，但是只要在螺絲Ｂ轉緊後，絲壓就只能在某一限度下變化了。</p>
<p>我曾經裝了好幾隻收音機，燈絲開關全是用的這法。因此無論何人，都能夠管理自如，毫無顧慮。膠木旋鈕，因為不易鑽洞，故不能應用。但是市上的木質旋鈕，也有很美觀的，極可採用。假使廠家能預先把膠木旋鈕獖好洞出售，那是再好也沒有了。</p>
<h3>高週放大的交連電路</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>三混合阻力交連法　此類亦可分為二項。</p>
<p>甲，調屏混合阻力交連－此式交連法效力甚佳，其調節線路，對於諧振周率之混合阻力，儘可至十萬歐姆而不變，惟若高放管用三極式時，則因屏阻亦並連於阻亦並連於調節綫路，易使混合阻力減低，而選擇力薄弱耳，如圖四所示，</p>
<p>乙，並連屏壓饋電交連－此式交連法，其屏極直流另設分道，一面藉電阻Ｒ兩端所起之電壓變動，由Ｃ傅遞至檢波管柵極，如圖五所示，其缺點與電阻交連同，不贅，故普通為避免屏流無甚降壓起見，以阻流圈代電阻，但此阻流圈不能有潛佈電容量放，以防大率減低，如圖六圖七所示卽是，圖八亦為並連屏壓饋電配合之一種，所不同者，僅傅遞電波之電容器Ｃ易以綫圈，此式交連法對於任何周率均極平勻，而選擇性極超特，絕非以上其他各式所能媲美也。</p>
<p>（附識）各圖中，左首者為高放管，右首為檢波管（完）</p>

Mr. Shi was not only a leader in the press, but also enthusiastic about various social causes. His untimely death is a great loss to the nation and society. The thugs had been waiting for Mr. Shi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road for several days, indicating an organized and planned assassination. However, since Mr. Shi had no political affiliations, it is likely a personal vendetta. The government is making every effort to investigate this case, and a breakthrough is expected soon. The provincial government has specially sent Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian to Shanghai by express train this afternoon to offer condolences and discuss the arrest of the perpetrators with the Shanghai authorities. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Martial Law Stamp Tax Amendment for Review</h3>
<p>Summary of Sixteen Key Points of the Martial Law</p>
<p>Content of the Revised Stamp Tax Rates</p>
<p>At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 16th in Nanjing, Ma Yinchu reported on the reasons and process for reviewing the new stamp tax rates. Chen Changheng, Liu Kejian, Shi Shangkuan, Qu Zengze, Luo Ding, and others also proposed amendments. The content mainly adopted simple methods for (delivery notes), (money receipts), and (relief bills) to take into account tax revenue as a principle. It was advocated that the Yuan should amend it automatically. Ma also expressed in a personal capacity that the set tax rate seemed too high. After a vote, the majority voted to amend it automatically, so it was decided to submit the amendment to the penalty rules together with the order of the Central Political Council to the four committees of finance, civil law, commercial law, and criminal law for review. Ma stated that the principle of stamp tax lies in the legal validity of various documents, which is different from the principles of other taxes. If a progressive tax or a tax rate that is too high is adopted, it will not only be inconvenient to calculate, but also inevitably turn into double taxation on one item. Therefore, he believes that it should be reduced. In general, the above three types of documents will still be divided into two levels according to the tax rates and methods of the original draft proposed by the Ministry of Finance: one cent for more than one yuan, and two cents for more than ten yuan, up to a maximum of two or three cents. For documents such as deeds of sale, a slightly higher rate may be considered. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing on the 16th, the Martial Law was amended and passed with a total of sixteen articles. The key points are summarized as follows: 1. When martial law should be implemented for the whole country or a certain area in the event of war, the National Government, after deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, may declare martial law or cause it to be declared in accordance with these measures; 2. Martial law areas are divided into two types: one is the alert area, and the other is the combat area; 3. During wartime, fortresses, naval ports, naval shipyards, or a certain area suddenly surrounded or attacked by the enemy, or in response to extraordinary incidents, the highest commander of the area may declare temporary martial law; 4. The highest commanders who declare temporary martial law are as follows: 1. Commanders specially appointed, 2. Army commanders, 3. Division commanders, 4. Brigade commanders, 5. Fortress defense commanders, 6. Naval fleet commanders, 7. Naval port commanders; 5. During martial law, local administrative and judicial officials in the alert area shall be subject to the command of the highest commander of the area in handling matters related to military affairs; 6. In the combat area, military organs may try the following crimes under the Criminal Law themselves or hand them over to the court for trial: 1. Crimes of internal rebellion, 2. Crimes of foreign aggression, 3. Crimes of disturbing order, 4. Crimes of public danger, 5. Crimes of counterfeiting currency, valuable securities, and documents and seals, 6. Crimes of murder, 7. Crimes of obstructing freedom, 8. Crimes of robbery, theft, and piracy, 9. Crimes of intimidation and kidnapping for ransom, 10. Crimes of destruction and damage; 7. When there is no court in the combat area or the court under its jurisdiction is cut off from communication, criminal and civil cases may be tried by the military organs in the area; 8. The martial law commander has the power to perform the following matters: 1. To stop meetings, associations, or ban newspapers, magazines, pictures, advertisements, slogans, etc. that are considered to be detrimental to military affairs; 2. To open and read postal mail and telegrams, and if necessary, to detain or confiscate them; 3. To inspect ships, vehicles, and aircraft entering and leaving the country, and if necessary, to stop their traffic and cut off their main roads and routes; 4. To inspect travelers who are considered suspicious; 5. If necessary, to inspect private firearms, cannons, ammunition, weapons, fire tools, and other dangerous items, and to detain or confiscate them; 6. To conduct inspections of buildings, ships, and residences in the combat area that are considered suspicious, but shall not intentionally damage them; 7. Those who reside in the combat area may be ordered to withdraw if necessary; 8. When it is unavoidable for combat purposes, the real property of the people may be destroyed, but compensation shall be given as appropriate; 9. When extraordinary incidents occur in the country and martial law should be implemented in a certain area, the National Government may declare martial law without the deliberation of the Legislative Yuan, but the powers of local administrative and judicial organs shall not be infringed upon in the martial law area. Regarding criminal cases, if it is considered that military-related investigations should be conducted, the military organs of the area may handle them jointly with the judicial organs. After the investigation, they shall still be handed over to the judicial organs for handling in accordance with the law. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing on the 16th, Ma Yinchu, Chen Changheng, Liu Kejian, Shi Shangkuan, Qu Zengze, and Luo Ding proposed an amendment to the stamp tax rates, stating that the stamp tax law case had been resolved at the 73rd Yuan meeting and has not yet been promulgated by the National Government. Now, the President of the Yuan has forwarded the letter from the Secretariat of the Central Political Council and various provincial, county, and city chambers of commerce or federations of chambers of commerce, citizen federations, and trade associations, stating that the newly set stamp tax law rates are much higher than the current tax rates and are inconsistent with the principles set by the Political Conference. Please correct them. There are a total of 23 petitions or telegrams. Furthermore, the President of the Yuan has issued 20 documents requesting correction of this case. After reviewing the content, it is found that delivery notes are only used for counting purposes, money receipts are only a procedure for on-the-spot delivery, and relief bills are even more temporary notes, and the time is very short, but the set tax rate is actually 100 or 50 times higher than the current tax rate, and they appeal to swiftly correct them in accordance with the principles resolved last year. Yinchu and others have carefully checked and found that the statements are urgent and there is considerable reason. Since this case has not yet been ordered to be promulgated, it is proposed that the tax rates for the items of delivery notes, money receipts, and relief bills be appropriately amended and a more simple and easy-to-implement fixed tax be adopted, while still taking into account the tax revenue of the country. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Plan to Reorganize Mongolian Affairs</h3>
<p>Xiao Zhenying's Talk</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying in Peiping talked about Chairman Chiang's extreme concern for Mongolian affairs. I have submitted a plan to reorganize Mongolian affairs, which should be adopted. The central government's plan for reorganizing Mongolian affairs will in the future enrich the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, organize the Mongolian Political Council, and subordinate it to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is the highest authority for governing Mongolian affairs, and everything is presided over by Mongolians and Tibetans. The funds for the Mongolian Political Council have been approved by Chiang and are allocated at 30,000 yuan per month, starting from this month. Princes Yun and De have sent Bu Yinglai, director of the nomadic office of the Mongolian Political Council, and Councilor Chen Shaowu to receive the funds. Bu Yinglai has now come to Peiping from Bailingmiao and will go to Beijing within a few days. The central government's past isolation from Mongolia has been completely eliminated after Chiang's inspection of the Northwest. The central government's measures to support Mongolia's development have been fully implemented. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Construction of Water Conservancy in the Northwest and Rural Relief</h3>
<p>In recent years, the countryside has gone bankrupt, the young and strong have resorted to desperate measures, and the old and weak have fallen into ditches. In the commercial cities along the river and coast, there is a surplus of funds, and prices inevitably rise accordingly. The national economy presents a distorted development trend. Many insightful people have advocated the idea of "going to the interior," and the vast Northwest is particularly the focus of their attention. After the loss of the Northeast, the people of the country have attached more importance to the Northwest. It is not surprising, especially since the Northwest has always been known for its natural wealth. If it can be actively developed and defended well today, so that it does not become a continuation of the Northeast, what is lost in the east can easily be gained in the west. National leaders such as Dai Jitao, Song Ziwen, and others have repeatedly toured the Northwest, and the financial industry in the coastal areas of the Southeast has also gradually paid attention to the promotion of business in the Northwest. These are all signs of a change in the atmosphere and are to be welcomed. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the domestic financial industry have joined forces to engage in the project of diverting the Wei River for irrigation. This project has now become a reality and is truly a blessing for the people of the Northwest.</p>
<p>Speaking of the construction of water conservancy in the Northwest, we should be able to recall the completion of the Jing and Luo canals. The canal water irrigates more than one million mu of land, which is largely due to the efforts of the National Economic Council. This time, the Shaanxi Provincial Government has continued to make efforts to divert the Wei River and build dams, benefiting the countryside. Its contribution cannot be ignored. What is especially commendable is that such an important project did not rely on a single foreign investment. The project cost of 1.5 million yuan was lent by five domestic banks and secured by the water tax and land tax of the Jing and Luo canals previously built. This is another example of the financial industry's belief in the enthusiasm of government agencies.</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture, and the rural economy is originally the center of gravity of the national economy. In recent years, the reason why a corner of the Northwest has fallen into a state of bankruptcy is that farmers can only provide their physical labor and have no way to obtain the necessities of life such as food and clothing. Therefore, some have become bandits, and some have died of starvation. Even those who are fortunate enough to flee famine and seek food in the cities only deepen the panic of urban unemployment. We have abundant resources in the Northwest, but we still allow the resources to be abandoned and the people to suffer. Is it not very sad that the local people are not only harmed but also promote the decline of the national economy? Water conservancy projects and rural construction are inherently closely related. The need for water conservancy in the Northwest is more urgent than in other places. The significance of investing in water conservancy in the Northwest is vastly different from spending thousands of millions of yuan on the buying and selling of public bonds and real estate.</p>
<p>In short, if we want to seek the revival of agriculture in the Northwest, we must wait for the promotion of water conservancy projects. However, the Northwest is short of funds and unable to cope, so it relies on the assistance of the urban financial industry to be effective. The cost of diverting the Wei River and building canals is only 1.5 million yuan. The amount is not large, but its benefits to the Northwest far outweigh the general relief plans that do not fall to the edge. It is deeply hoped that the ruling authorities of all provinces in the country and the central water conservancy agencies will be able to formulate detailed and clear plans based on the actual needs of water conservancy in the rural areas of various places, and then consult with the urban financial industry to request investment and implement them step by step. Do not let the Jing and Luo canals and the recent Wei River diversion project be the only beautiful examples.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee Releases Report</h3>
<p>Explains China's Six-Year Opium Eradication Plan</p>
<p>Chinese Representative Says Cooperation from a Certain Country is Essential</p>
<p>Geneva - The Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations today released a report stating that China's recently submitted regulations to the League regarding the strict prohibition of opium and narcotics include the frequent use of the death penalty. Anyone injecting morphine into another person for non-medical reasons is also subject to the death penalty. The new regulations aim to cease the issuance of opium smoking licenses after six years. Within these six years, the elderly or those with deep-seated habits may be allowed to smoke, but only with a license, and only licensed vendors are permitted to sell opium to these smokers. The Chinese representative attending the opium conference stated today that cooperation from a certain country is essential, otherwise, China's anti-drug campaign will ultimately be ineffective. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The Advisory Committee on Opium of the League of Nations held a meeting today, resolving to establish a subcommittee to meet before each session of the Advisory Committee. This would prioritize the order of discussion for each item on the agenda, according to their importance. The Advisory Committee then presented and studied a report on its work, stating that the 1925 International Opium Convention had been ratified by 52 countries. The 1931 International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs had been ratified by 48 countries. Furthermore, the Siamese representative informed the Advisory Committee that the Siamese government had ratified the Bangkok Agreement (signed on November 27, 1931, by England, France, Japan, Portugal, the Netherlands, India, Siam, and other countries). This agreement will come into effect once ratified by Japan and India. The report also documented the laws promulgated within China, regarding: 1. monitoring poisons; 2. eliminating drug addiction; 3. opium smoking licenses; and 4. the import of acetic anhydride and caffeine. It also noted that the Chinese representative had requested the cooperation of a certain country (referring to Japan) at the last meeting of the Advisory Committee, stating that otherwise, China's efforts to eliminate narcotics would be in vain. The Advisory Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Denies Approving Loan to Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Eden Also Announces to the House of Commons</p>
<p>No Negotiations with Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Visits U.S. Secretary of State</p>
<p>London - News this morning stated that the Foreign Office yesterday firmly denied to the Chinese Minister, Quo Tai-Chi, any intention of the UK lending money to Japan for [Manchukuo]. Minister Quo inquired of the Foreign Office regarding recent rumors that the London Naval Talks were related to British-Japanese political and economic activities. It is now known that Quo specifically raised the rumored Japanese demand for British recognition of its special interests in China and its special status in the Pacific, in exchange for Japan not infringing upon British interests in China and the Pacific. According to reliable British sources, this rumor may have originated at the beginning of the Naval Talks when Japan expressed its desire to maintain the best possible relationship with Britain, and Britain requested Tokyo to clarify this point. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Minister Eden stated in the House of Commons today that there were no ongoing negotiations or talks between Britain and Japan regarding the Far Eastern situation and the future of [Manchukuo]. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, stated today that Japan may be compelled by circumstances to act as an intermediary between the United States and [Manchukuo] to resolve the dispute over the Manchukuo oil monopoly. This statement was made after Saito's meeting with Secretary of State Hull at the State Department. However, he also stated that he did not suggest this point to Hull today. Although [Manchukuo] was mentioned during today's meeting, neither side raised the issue of the oil monopoly. It is understood that Hull is currently continuing to study the Japanese response and preparing to decide on the steps the United States should take next. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Saito also stated that he did not propose that Japan would be willing to mediate when he met with Secretary of State Hull today. The two discussed general issues in the Far East. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Businesses Agree on Countermeasures Against Manchukuo Oil Monopoly</h3>
<p>London - The [Manchukuo] government announced its oil monopoly policy, and British oil companies are taking this matter seriously. Representatives convened an emergency committee on the 15th to discuss countermeasures. Representatives hope for an amicable resolution, so retaliatory measures such as the Manchukuo Petroleum Company's Dalian refinery not selling crude oil seem unlikely to be implemented. (Japanese United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>To Counter U.S. Plan for Pacific Aviation, Japan Plans to Purchase Airships from Germany</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Aviation National Policy Research Association, chaired by Kabayama Sukehide, has decided to establish a Japan-[Manchukuo] joint venture, Pacific Aviation Corporation, with a capital of 20 million yen in the spring of next year. They plan to operate three airships to pioneer Pacific air routes to counter Pan American Airways' transpacific flights between San Francisco, Honolulu, Manila, and Shanghai. They will first purchase a Zeppelin-type airship from Germany in the coming spring for 6 million yen and open a non-stop air route between Tokyo and Changchun. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, Zeppelin Company technician, Pridehoff, will represent Dr. Eckener to come to Japan for negotiations. If this first phase of the plan succeeds, capital will be increased to have three airships in regular operation for Pacific scheduled flights. (Dentsu, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain and China to Have New Proposals at Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Expanding the Scope of Arms Monitoring</p>
<p>Britain and the U.S. Form a United Front</p>
<p>London - The British government will propose suggestions on the monitoring of arms by Minister Eden at the meeting of the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference next Tuesday. It is generally believed that this proposal will be broader in scope than the draft previously proposed by the Cabinet. The first British draft only generalized the arms export licensing system adopted by Britain. Now, it further advocates the establishment of a broader and more effective monitoring system. The reason for Britain's change of attitude may be due to the recent written advocacy of arms monitoring by Washington, or there may be other reasons. This time, the British proposal includes three items: 1. The manufacture of arms should require a license; 2. The export of arms should require a license; 3. Countries should publish reports on the amount of arms and ammunition produced. This proposal is identical to the plan proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Hull on the first of this week. It can be seen that it will not be difficult for Britain and the United States to form a united front on the matter of arms monitoring at the Geneva Conference. It is generally believed here that if Britain insists on this view, it will inevitably be opposed by the German side because once this monitoring plan is implemented, those who store and manufacture arms and ammunition that have not been discovered by the League of Nations will no longer be able to hide them.

<h3>The U.S. Seeks Italy's Views on International Control of Arms Trade</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Visits Mussolini</p>
<p>Rome - After the U.S. government decided to draw up another international arms trade control agreement, Wilson, the U.S. Navy representative in London, arrived here today to discuss the issue with the Italian government. It is now believed that after completing his mission here, Wilson will inquire with other countries in Europe and Asia whether they are willing to participate in the drafting of an arms trade agreement.

<h3>British Disarmament Policy Has Only Three Paths to Follow</h3>
<p>Willing to Assist the League of Nations in Formulating a Convention</p>
<p>National Defense Needs Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>London - Minister Eden delivered a speech last night, once again explaining the British government's attitude towards the issue of peace. First, he criticized the [military training] implemented by some countries, and the audience applauded in approval. Then, he entered the main topic, saying, [We now have three policies that can be adopted: 1. An isolationist policy sounds appealing, but is actually impossible. 2. Unilateral disarmament is also absurd. Once Britain disarms, it will be unable to promote peace. 3. A compromise, which is what we should adopt. In other words, take responsibility to assist the League of Nations in formulating a disarmament convention and enrich the joint system of upholding peace while not neglecting the current needs of national defense.] (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Seriously Considering New British Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>Balances Current Ratios with Equal Rights</p>
<p>Anglo-American Cooperation Plan After Failure</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull today received the full report of the British-American naval talks from Special Envoy Davis. Hull declared that he would now take this report to Tennessee, where President Roosevelt is currently inspecting, and that he would seriously consider the report. According to reliable sources, the British Foreign Office has carefully inquired on what basis the United States would consider an Anglo-American cooperation plan after the failure of the triangular conference. The State Department has not yet given a concrete response. According to public opinion here, the United States is absolutely opposed to actual naval equality for Japan and is unwilling to accept any proposals to reduce battleships and aircraft carriers. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Before and after the meeting of the British and American naval representatives yesterday, a new naval treaty containing concessions from various countries seemed possible. British representatives yesterday submitted the issue of preparing such a new treaty to the American representatives for instructions to the U.S. capital. The American side seems optimistic about the new approach proposed by the British representatives. The British side advocates giving the Japanese more submarines, giving the United States larger battleships and aircraft carriers, while Britain would have more cruisers. Although Japan is granted equality in principle, the 5:5:3 ratio will still be retained. The Japanese government has instructed Matsudaira and Yamamoto today to ask the British side to explain the intention behind their proposal. The Japanese side seems to be willing to negotiate a compromise. The British side advocates that the major powers make individual declarations, explaining the naval construction they desire, and then establish a gentleman's agreement, which does not mention ratios but still uses the 5:5:3 ratio as the basis for the naval strength of all parties.</p>
<h3>Three New Paths</h3>
<p>When Japan declared the abrogation of the Washington Treaty, it was anticipated that no more than three paths could be taken: 1. Continuing the Washington Treaty without Japan's participation; 2. Each of the three countries makes concessions; 3. No treaty is established. The first method was supported by the American side, but not by the British side. The British side tends towards the second method, which is to conclude a new treaty, making appropriate concessions to Japan on the one hand while still retaining the ratio principle on the other. The reason why Britain has this view is that having an agreement is better than nothing. However, whether the American side can accept this method, the American representatives have not yet received instructions from their government. Yesterday, the British and American representatives had a detailed discussion on the first and second of these methods. As for the third method, only a brief outline was mentioned without detailed discussion.</p>
<p>Japan's opposition to the continuation of the 5:5:3 system has never shown any signs of retreat. Therefore, the desire to slightly modify the Washington and London Naval Treaties and continue their effectiveness now seems impossible. In this environment, the only option is to negotiate a new treaty that Japan can accept to replace them. How much is the United States prepared to concede to accommodate Japan and avoid naval construction competition? This is what American representative Davis now wants to know. If the United States is unwilling to change its position and Japan is unwilling to give up its demands, then another method has to be considered. According to reliable sources, Britain and the United States may be able to form an agreement where the two sides do not engage in naval construction competition but still maintain their advantage over Japan in the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is expected that Japan will ask the British side to explain its naval needs next week. If so, then the talks will involve a more technical nature. If the United States also participates, then this talk will be the first step towards the naval conference next summer.</p>
<p>Today, the British representatives went to the Japanese Embassy for a banquet but did not discuss political matters. British Prime Minister MacDonald will host the American delegation at his villa this Saturday. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>London - The British representatives presented a compromise plan to the United States at the Anglo-American talks on the 14th. The content is the same concept as the compromise plan for Japan, but in essence, it still maintains the current 5:5:3 ratio. The general idea is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Recognize Japan's equality in principle.</p>
<p>(2) Unilaterally declare that the actual naval strength will still maintain the 5:5:3 ratio.</p>
<p>(3) Make considerable reforms to the restrictions on different types of ships, limit the naval power held according to the needs of each country, and allow the United States to build larger battleships.</p>
<p>(4) Stipulate that the maximum tonnage of battleships is 30,000 tons and the maximum gun caliber is 14 inches.</p>
<p>(5) Based on the above points, establish a new treaty to replace the current treaty. (Japanese United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The British side proposed that the single ship tonnage of battleships should be 26,000 tons, with guns of 12 inches or less, and cruisers should be 7,500 tons, with guns of 6 inches or less. The American representatives advocated battleships of 34,000 tons, with guns of 14 inches, and cruisers of 10,000 tons, with guns of 8 inches. As a result, a compromise was reached on battleships with a tonnage of around 30,000 tons. (Dentsu, 16th)</p>

<p>Seeking to Maintain Treaty Obligations on the Saar Issue</p>
<p>Paris - Foreign Minister Laval attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives today and stated the foreign situation, concluding that [France is loyal to its allies and friends and will never change.] Laval first mentioned the work of the Saar Tripartite Committee in Rome, saying that he firmly believed that the development of the Saar plebiscite procedures formulated by the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations Administrative Council would be normal. As for France, it should be in a purely objective position, abide by this procedure. The only goal France has is to seek free voting in the Saar, without any influence, and has decided to fulfill all the obligations stipulated in the treaty in the spirit of peace, and protect the interests within its duties. Laval then mentioned his future trip to Rome, saying that the efforts made by the late Foreign Minister Barthou must be continued to enable the governments of Italy and France to establish close compromises and coordinate with other countries concerned with maintaining peace. Finally, Laval mentioned the continued negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty, saying that the policy of cooperation with Russia should be continued, which is beneficial to both France itself and the cause of peace. The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee was very pleased that the government and the committee had the same views. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Parliament Adjourns, Rescheduled to Reopen on the 20th of this Month to Discuss India's Constitutional Reform</h3>

He hopes that the efforts of the British representatives will be successful, so that the world can avoid the harm of the arms race. This Parliament has passed many important controversial cases, such as handling unemployment relief on a national basis and curbing sedition laws. Therefore, when it reopens on the 20th of this month, it can freely discuss India's constitutional reform case without being disturbed by other matters. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Gao Bingfang Discusses Steps to Reorganize Local Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>Gao Bingfang, Secretary-General of the Local Tax Reorganization Committee of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, said that the provinces have abolished more than 1,000 kinds of harsh and miscellaneous taxes, amounting to approximately 24 million yuan. It is estimated that there will be a further reduction of more than 8 million yuan by the end of this year. Given the current financial difficulties of the central and local governments, this determination and perseverance are truly commendable. The future task is to strive to reorganize local tax revenue and eliminate corruption. The steps are divided into three points: First, determine the budgets of each county starting from 1935. Second, unify the tax collection agencies of each county to reduce administrative expenses. Third, severely punish corrupt tax collectors, train talented people, and establish a culture of integrity, so that local finances will gradually move towards the right track. (Sixteenth)</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Arrives in Hankou by Plane Yesterday</h3>
<p>Heading East Today to See Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Communist Bandits in Sichuan Can Be Eliminated in Four Months</p>
<p>Liu Xiang, accompanied by Xu Yuanquan, arrived in Hankou at 1:00 PM on the 16th from Shashi aboard the China National Aviation Corporation's Nanjing aircraft. He is staying at the Central Bank and is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi to see Chiang Kai-shek on the 17th or 18th. According to his remarks, the suppression of bandits in Sichuan can be divided into two routes. The northern route, Xu Xiangqian's troops, is being blocked and suppressed by the Sichuan army and can be responsible for maintaining the status quo. The southern route, He Long's troops and the Jiangxi bandits, must be pursued and suppressed by the central government commanding the armies of various provinces. Other major plans will be decided after seeing Chiang Kai-shek. It is reported that He Chengjun has decided to accompany Liu to Jiangxi. Sun Weiru, under the orders of Yang Hucheng, arrived in Hankou on the 16th to meet with Liu. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fan Chengfu, the representative of Liu Xiang in Nanjing, reported that Liu will arrive in Hankou by plane from Yichang on the 17th. He specifically took a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Hankou on the morning of the 16th to greet him and report on his situation after meeting with the authorities in Nanjing. According to Fan at the airport, Liu still needs to go to Jiangxi to see Chiang Kai-shek after arriving in Hankou. Whether or not he will come to Nanjing will be decided after arriving in Jiangxi.

<p>Liu Xiang arrived in Shashi at 9:00 AM on the 16th aboard the Bayu warship. Chen Guangzu, He Chengjun's representative, flew from Hankou to Shashi by plane. Liu, along with Chen Guangzu, Xu Yuanquan, and Qiu Jia, took a postal plane to Hankou at 11:00 AM and arrived at 1:10 PM. He Chengjun, Qian Dajun, Zhang Qun, and others went to greet him. Liu stayed at the Central Bank and had a cordial conversation with those who greeted him and returned greetings to He Chengjun. He Chengjun and Zhang Qun are scheduled to host a banquet on the 17th to welcome Liu. Liu told a Central News Agency reporter that this time he only stayed in Wanxian for one day and is scheduled to go east from Hankou on the 17th to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In the past, the military affairs of bandit suppression in Sichuan were delayed due to the lack of coordination among the armies, economic difficulties, and the treacherous terrain, which was unavoidable. Currently, northern Sichuan is on the defensive. It is reported that Xiao Ke's troops have been blocked by the Guizhou army and have fled to Dayong. In the future, if the suppression is intensified, the elimination of bandits in Sichuan is not a difficult task. Although the length of time cannot be determined, if efforts are made, it may be effective in four months. I am eager to launch a general offensive as soon as possible to clear the remaining bandits. The military and political affairs of Sichuan need to be unified before we can talk about rectifying politics, utilizing political effectiveness, appeasing the local people, and engaging in post-bandit suppression. As for the financial aspect, it is proposed to return the salt tax to the central government and issue 70 million yuan in public bonds for the reorganization of Sichuan. This time, in addition to asking Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions on bandit suppression strategies, I also want to make a request regarding politics and finance so that it can be conveyed to the central government for approval.

<h3>Shaanxi Industry Inspection Group Returns West</h3>
<p>Xuzhou: The Shaanxi Industry Inspection Group, including Li Weicheng and Zhang Bingchang, arrived in Xuzhou from Lianyungang on the evening of the 15th. On the 16th, they inspected the industrial and commercial situation in the urban and rural areas and visited scenic spots. They returned west at noon, stopping in Bian, Zheng, and Luoyang for inspections. According to the group, they visited the old wharf at the port, the Xugou municipal area, the Xinpu commercial area, the Yuntai Mountain scenic area, the Banpu salt ponds, and the east and west Lian Islands for three days. They were deeply impressed by the port's scenery, terrain, engineering, and commerce. In the future, the import and export of goods from the Northwest's development will rely entirely on this port. The mutual prosperity of China's Southeast and Northwest also depends on the close connections of the Longhai Railway. Shaanxi's land can be restored to the status of a country with its own treasury. With the cooperation of Director Yang and Chairman Shao in development and construction, promoting production, and with the investment and development by the Economic Committee and the banking community in Shanghai, Shaanxi Province has shown a new and prosperous atmosphere in recent years. The group hopes that overseas Chinese and the national business community will pay attention to the Northwest's development. After visiting the construction, industry, and commerce along the Longhai Railway, the group plans to use it as a reference upon returning to Shaanxi. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants in Guangdong Refuse to Pay Business Tax</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently warned that if foreign merchants do not pay business tax in accordance with government regulations, the Chinese will boycott them. However, most foreign merchants here believe that the business tax is inappropriate and have consistently refused to pay. The Business Tax Bureau today reported to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance that the deadline for foreigners to pay taxes has expired, but very few have complied with the regulations. British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anthony Eden's remarks in the House of Commons on Wednesday have further strengthened the attitude of foreigners in refusing to pay this tax, especially the British. Eden's remarks have been widely published in local newspapers and have attracted the attention of officials, but no criticism has been made. It is reported that the Department of Finance is currently discussing with the Chamber of Commerce the steps to be taken regarding foreign merchants who refuse to pay taxes. Foreign merchants believe that they are already paying stamp duty and other taxes, so they consider the business tax inappropriate. However, the Chamber of Commerce has notified foreign merchants to comply with the regulations, and those who violate them will bear the consequences themselves. It is feared that this will lead to a significant development between Chinese and foreign merchants. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3>Rushing to Handle Local Post-Disaster Relief After the Recovery of Changting</h3>
<p>Five Measures Resolved by Fellow Villagers in the Province</p>
<p>Special Education Office Established in Western Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the recovery of Changting, the Provincial Government appointed Lin Sixian, the Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District, as the concurrent Magistrate of Changting County and moved the Commissioner's Office from Liancheng to Tingcheng to handle post-disaster relief. The first step is to allocate funds for disaster relief to allow the victims of the catastrophe in Ting County to survive. The second step is to recruit refugees who have fled to other places to return to their hometowns to resume their businesses. Fellow villagers from Changting, Liancheng, Wuping, Yongding, Shanghang, Mingxi, and Ninghua counties in Fujian Province specially convened a joint symposium the other day to discuss the way forward. It was resolved that: 1. A fellow villager association from Tingzhou in the province should be organized to assist the government in preparing for post-disaster relief. 2. A registration office for refugees from Tingzhou staying in the province should be established to prepare for sending them back to their hometowns. 3. The counties of Tingzhou have suffered from bandits for many years, and social organizations have been completely destroyed. To seek post-disaster relief, it is necessary for the government to allocate a large amount of special funds. Otherwise, nothing can be done. A request should be submitted to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Nanchang Headquarters to allocate special funds as post-disaster relief funds. 4. The plan for relieving refugees in the bandit areas should be divided into three items: (A) Request the government to recruit refugees to build roads and fortresses as a form of work relief. (B) Request the Four Provinces Farmers Bank to establish offices in the recovered counties to circulate local finance. (C) Request the government to allocate funds to establish farmers' loan offices in various townships to facilitate farmers' borrowing and engage in village revival. 5. Zheng Hua, Qiu Weihou, Fan Jiongcheng, Xie Zhaoqi, Lai Lian, Lai Weizhou, and Kang Shaozhou were elected as representatives to go to the capital to request relief from the National Government. Liao Jiangnan, Yang Xuemen, Ye Xianbo, Xu Zuomei, and Qiu YunChu were elected as representatives to go to the Nanchang Headquarters in Jiangxi to request relief. They are now proceeding separately. In addition, regarding special education in the recovered areas of western Fujian, the Department of Education has repeatedly received urgent telegrams from the Nanchang Headquarters urging active handling and allocating Gengzi Indemnity funds as expenses. The Department of Education has now established a special education office for western Fujian, with Director Zheng Zhenwen concurrently serving as the head of the office, and Section Chief Tang Shouqian concurrently serving as the secretary. Three departments are established under it: administration, training, and research, each with a director and several staff members. It is planned to first establish people's schools and simple primary schools in the recovered counties, and then gradually expand them. All books will be provided by the government to reduce the burden on the people. (13th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Inspects Tax Collection Agencies in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Various Agencies Host a Public Banquet at the Guesthouse</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, together with Chairman Chiang's wife, Madam Soong Mei-ling, and advisor Donner, arrived in Qingdao by plane from Jinan yesterday (the 14th) afternoon. At around 9:00 a.m. this morning, Mayor Shen Honglie accompanied Kong to visit the coastal area of Huiquan Sports Field by car. He then went to No. 2 Zhanshan Road to survey the land because Kong plans to build a summer villa in Qingdao. At 10:30 a.m., Mayor Shen quickly returned to the municipal government, and Kong immediately went to inspect the Central Bank, the Lu-Yu District Consolidated Tax Bureau, the Jiaohai Customs, the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and the tobacco, alcohol, and stamp tax offices. At the Consolidated Tax Bureau, he gave a speech to the staff. At 11:30 a.m., he finished the inspection and returned to the guesthouse to rest. At noon, the leaders of various agencies hosted a public banquet for Kong, Madam Soong, Donner, and others at the guesthouse. At 7:00 p.m., Mayor Shen and his wife, Madam Hu Yingzhi, hosted a banquet for Kong and Soong at the guesthouse and invited various dignitaries and their wives to accompany them. Because Kong is busy with departmental affairs, he cannot stay in Qingdao for a long time and is scheduled to fly to Nanjing by the original plane tomorrow (the 16th). (15th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Dynamite Explosion at the Kuixing Tower in Zouping, Shandong</h3>
<p>Two Students of the Rural Construction Institute Killed in the Explosion</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The students of the training department of the Zouping Rural Construction Institute have completed one phase of training at the institute. Now is the slack season for agriculture, and the entire group is going to the countryside for practical training. They have been led by teachers and have set off one after another, which will soon be completed. After lunch yesterday, there were still two students, Zhang Jinzhen and Chu Hong, who had not set off. They were walking on the city wall and climbed the Kuixing Tower at the corner of the city wall. Unexpectedly, dynamite was stored in the tower, and it suddenly exploded. The Kuixing Tower was completely destroyed and collapsed. Zhang and Chu were killed immediately. According to the investigation, the dynamite in the Kuixing Tower was stored in 1930 and was sealed in mud. It has been several years since then. This accident was truly unexpected. (15th)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Discusses Issuance of Public Bonds in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Developing Various Undertakings</p>
<p>Supporting Cooperation Among Various Industries</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie went to Jinan from Qingdao this morning (the 14th) to meet with Zhou Zuomin to discuss investment in various undertakings in Qingdao and to wait to meet with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to discuss the issuance of public bonds. According to Shen, "Qingdao's finances have a regular annual income of 5.4 million yuan. Normally, because the operating expenses are too large, they are insufficient. If new major construction projects are undertaken, the funds will be even more scarce. Therefore, it has been decided to issue public bonds to provide relief. The amount will be approximately 1.5 million to 2 million yuan, which is still subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Fortunately, all undertakings in Qingdao are guaranteed and should be approved. Foreign merchants are generally willing to invest unconditionally in the construction of Qingdao. I think that if the country is really unable to do so, it may be possible to use foreign capital. However, if there is a way to think of it, raising domestic debt is better than raising foreign debt. Therefore, it has been decided to issue public bonds. As for the use of the public bonds: 1. Adding to the waterworks. After the Qingdao waterworks was renovated, the original plan was that it could be used for five years or less. Unexpectedly, it has not been sufficient in recent years, so it is necessary to actively expand the waterworks. 2. Adding to the piers. Qingdao originally had Piers No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. Pier No. 5 is also nearing completion. However, because of the rapid development of industry and commerce and the increase in incoming and outgoing ships, the piers are still insufficient. Therefore, it is still necessary to add to them. It is now planned to add a pier in a small alley in the city and a pier in the Hongyouya area in the outer rural area of the city to facilitate the convenience of transportation by boat in the rural area. 3. Establishing a museum. Qingdao was initially managed by foreigners and did not pay much attention to the country's culture. Although it has been trying to promote development for more than ten years since the takeover, all facilities are still incomplete. Although the library was established long ago, the museum is still lacking. It has been decided to actively establish it for observation and research. The above three items are the most important uses of the public bonds. Other industrial and commercial activities are also being actively developed. 1. Cooperative undertakings. Production and sales cooperatives such as peanut and match cooperatives have already been established. In the past, matchsticks were used with foreign goods, and the leakage was very large. Now, Chinese merchants are also ordered to form cooperatives to compete with foreign goods. Coal mine production and sales cooperation has been brewing for many years due to the general merchants' failure to enlarge their vision, and it has not yet been established, which is regrettable. For coal in Qingdao, the municipal government has repeatedly reduced taxes to facilitate exports. For rural cooperative undertakings, a special fund of 150,000 yuan has been planned for handling. In short, it has been decided to actively cooperate in all undertakings in Qingdao. 2. Aiding small-capital industrial and commercial businesses. It has been previously contacted with Mr. Zhou Zuomin, and JinCheng Bank has invested 150,000 yuan specifically for this matter, limited to businesses of 10 to 1,000 yuan. Qingdao originally had an industrial and commercial bank that handles production undertakings with a capital of 100,000 yuan. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. Now, the share capital has been increased by 150,000 yuan to expand it. For all other construction projects in the city, even as small as setting up a toilet, I often personally go to guide and help make it appropriate. In addition, Laoshan Mountain, which has been assigned to Qingdao by the province and city, has been decided to actively construct and adorn famous mountains and scenic spots to attract tourists. The most important thing is roads. Many roads have been added and repaired. Huayan Nunnery to Qingshankou has been opened to automobiles. The famous Xiaqing Palace will soon be open to automobiles, etc. (14th)</p>
<h3>The Life of Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>A Recent Conversation Between a Reporter and Madam Sai</p>
<p>Zeng Mengpu's Love Affair Failed and Led Him to Write a Book</p>
<p>The Resemblance of Xin Yanqiu Evokes Sympathy</p>
<p>A Dispatch from Beiping Concerning Sai Jinhua (whose original name was Fu Caiyun, nickname Cao Menglan, and was called "Master Sai the Second" by Beijingers around the time of the庚子 Boxer Rebellion. She now calls herself Wei Zhao Lingfei, claiming to be maintaining fidelity to Wei Jiong), her recent news, and her various states of being. Ever since two years ago, when a certain tabloid discovered that she was still alive and living in obscurity in Chunming, reporters from various newspapers, considering her to be a famous woman related to a period of rise and fall in Chinese history, have been eagerly interviewing her and constantly writing about her. Whenever there was a lull in news or a scarcity of information, they would bring out Madam Sai, recounting her conversations and detailing her daily life. Therefore, the three characters "Sai Jinhua" have become a necessary topic for the news media to borrow from year after year for the past three years. Almost every newspaper finds an opportunity to mention her at least once, even if it's just in a couple of sentences. For this reason, Madam Sai, in her declining years, both poor and ill, suddenly received social attention and aroused general interest in both the North and the South. Her deserted lane has been constantly visited by scholars and celebrities, and figures in the film, drama, literature, and novel industries, as well as business people, especially regard her as a rare commodity, all wanting to meet her and use her as the only medium to attract the masses. (A certain theater in Peiping once invited her to give a speech, heavily advertising it beforehand, and tickets were sold for as much as nine yuan per seat. A certain restaurant opening this year also pulled in Madam Sai, inviting celebrities from all walks of life to visit. It's a pity that Madam Sai is frail, ill, and muddled, and other than chanting "Amitabha Buddha," she is unable to have even ordinary conversations clearly and fluently.) Madam Sai's personal livelihood has indeed become slightly more abundant due to this unexpected development, which has provided some small help (such as Zhang Jingsheng and Liu Bannong, who have successively provided her with small sums of money). At the same time, however, misunderstandings about her in society have become more pronounced, and the Sai Jinhua in people's imaginations is now immeasurably far from the reality. The reporter has a close and familiar relationship with Madam Sai, so I know her best. In my observation, the biggest reason for the outside world's misunderstanding of Madam Sai is Zeng Mengpu's novel "Niehai Hua" (Flower in a Sinful Sea), which was the original culprit. "Niehai Hua" was a famous political novel in the late Qing Dynasty. Its writing style was strong and it swept across the country. Now that Madam Sai has suddenly appeared, everyone who has read the novel has spontaneously recalled the Sai Jinhua that was deeply imprinted in their minds, thinking that this person must be an ingenious, clever, and extraordinarily intelligent female prodigy. Even though she is now past her prime, her character and talent must not be completely different, or perhaps still somewhat resemble what was depicted by the "Sick Man of East Asia" (Zeng Mengpu's pen name was "Sick Man of East Asia"). In fact, Zeng himself used his astonishing literary skills to create a game with his pen, deceiving many people in the world. In the eyes of this reporter, who has interviewed Madam Sai many times, her personality not only differs from the ideal in the novel but even greatly contradicts it in three aspects: First, the novel claims that she is proficient in English and German, especially excelling in Chinese writing and small calligraphy, often drafting memorials for Hong Jun. Today's Sai doesn't know a single foreign word and cannot even read a single word of the vernacular novels in the lower-class tabloids. Second, following Zeng's novel, Sai Jinhua novels continued to be published in Shanghai and Peiping, all claiming how patriotic and intelligent she was during the Gengzi Incident. Now, Madam Sai is not only poor, old, and mediocre, and does not resemble a talented and extraordinary woman who possessed genius in her youth (perhaps economic circumstances can indeed influence people), but she even doesn't know what the country is, let alone whether she is patriotic or not. The reporter asked her last year whether she had the same feeling about the September 18th National Crisis as she did about the Gengzi Incident, but she stared blankly, not knowing what I was talking about. So, the reporter changed the words and asked, "Do you know that the three northeastern provinces have been forcibly occupied by Japan?" She then suddenly replied, "I heard that 'the Eastern Ocean is making a lot of noise'." The reporter believes that the words "Eastern Ocean" are a common term used by the Shanghai public to refer to the Japanese. Sai, being a native of Suzhou who has lived in Shanghai for a long time, must not have any national political concepts or cultivation. This can be judged from the tone of this one "common saying." Third, her beauty is indeed as praised by the "Sick Man of East Asia," worthy of being called an oriental beauty, the unparalleled beauty of Suzhou and Wuxi. Although she is now old (she is sixty years old this year), the beauty of her eyebrows and the blackness of her hair can still evoke her past glory. Furthermore, her personal recent gift to the reporter of her childhood photographs from her golden age, with jade hairpins all over her head and beautiful appearance, confirms that she is indeed as written by Zeng, enough to captivate the German commander Waldersee without shame. Apart from this one point of "beauty," as for the unparalleled genius that made the Queen of England compare her to a "rebellious hero, an extraordinary beauty," it greatly contradicts the facts. Today's Sai is not only not intelligent but even speaks incoherently, giving people the feeling that she is mentally ill. If she really had world-shocking talent in her youth, even if old age were to plague her, her intelligence would not go to the extremes, as if she were two completely different people. With these three major points of contradiction, the reporter now does not hesitate to expend words to reveal the truth of the news to the readers (presenting the truth to people is also a creed that the reporter should uphold in their reporting duties), in order to dispel the confusion that has long been caused by the pens of novelists. According to the reporter's fair observation, Madam Sai's appearance in her youth was undoubtedly a beauty of the highest degree, and her intelligence may have been above average, not to the point of being shrewd but certainly not as praised by Zeng as having the talent to almost command heroes. This can be definitively stated based on the current reality of Sai Jinhua. As for the reason why she enjoys such a great reputation, it is nothing more than two paths: First, Zeng Mengpu's novel has a magnificent and unique writing style and is popular throughout the world. Madam Sai is its only thread connecting everything. (The book is entirely about political issues and does not exclusively focus on Sai Jinhua, so Lin Qinnan called it "a history, not a novel," referring to the fact that the book records the truth of the political situation in the late Qing Dynasty.) Unexpectedly, Sai and Zeng's book share the same great reputation throughout the ages. Second, the Gengzi Incident was a painful history related to the rise and fall of China. During the anarchic era of the Gengzi Incident, Sai lived with Waldersee in the Yiluan Hall, and sometimes even walked hand in hand, swaggering in the streets of Beijing. Therefore, the people of Beijing and the people of the whole country have a very deep impression of Sai. Anyone who knows about the Gengzi Incident almost invariably knows about Sai Jinhua. Thus, the name of Madam Sai became immortalized along with the historical facts of the Gengzi national disaster. In short, Sai's reputation can be completely called that of a lucky person. Aside from the point of "youthful romance, beautiful appearance, and promiscuous nature," she has no special qualities worthy of being matched with her great name. With the introduction clear, I will now attach a record of the reporter's interview with Madam Sai. Readers will be able to better understand her true situation. (The following is the reporter asking and Sai answering.) Reporter: How are you doing recently? Sai: I'm just old and ill and not getting better. Although I chant Buddha's name every day, the fox spirit still possesses me every night. But I am also fortunate to rely on the protection of the great immortal to avoid many dangers. Reporter: Is it still difficult to make a living? Sai: I'm always poor. Recently, thanks to the assistance of Mr. Zhang Jingsheng and Mr. Liu Bannong and other gentlemen, I can barely get through the winter. Reporter: Has anyone recently invited you to give a speech? Sai: I'm most afraid of giving speeches in my life. When I followed Lord Hong (referring to狀元Hong Wenqing), everything was old-fashioned rules, and I wouldn't even meet my boyfriend, so how could I go out and give speeches? So, last year, when the Harfei Grand Theater asked me to go on stage, I couldn't say a word. Plus, I was in pain, so the singer at the bottom had to speak for me before I could barely get off the stage. I also remember the European War Peace Memorial Meeting, when old Duan led a group of high-ranking officials on Dongcheng Street to dismantle the Keelin Monument (referring to the German Minister Keelin who was killed during the Gengzi Incident). That day, I went to visit with Mr. Wei (referring to her last husband, Wei Ling), and he asked me why I didn't say a few words, since you have a relationship with this monument. I immediately and decisively refused his request to give a speech, only taking back a red flower and storing it in my box as a souvenir. Reporter: What is your relationship with this monument? Sai: Li Hongzhang's peace negotiations with various countries were not successful, because Mrs. Keelin's demands were too harsh, only erecting a stone tablet. She didn't agree, so I mediated and told her that this tablet can only be erected in China by the emperor's family, and common people are not allowed to do so. Therefore, erecting it for Keelin can be said to be the most favorable condition for Germany in China. After I said this, Mrs. Keelin generously agreed. Reporter: You can be said to be a pioneer in the women's world during the Gengzi period, and the most patriotic. Sai: I'm not patriotic. It's just that I knew their country's officials at the time, and sometimes I spoke a few words of peace. I couldn't bear to see German soldiers beating Chinese people, so I sincerely tried my best to tell Waldersee, and he gave the order not to beat Chinese people to death with rough wooden sticks anymore. I saved more than 10,000 Beijingers from the hands of the German soldiers. At that time, there were so many people who sent me money. My mother told me that I was only allowed to accept gifts and not money. I lived with Waldersee in the Yiluan Hall for four months (this hall is today's Huiren Hall in Zhongnanhai). When he left, he wanted to take me back to Germany, but I didn't want to. He also told me to take whatever precious items I wanted from the palace, but I didn't dare to take anything. Reporter: Is the romantic affair mentioned in "Niehai Hua" true? Sai: It's all rumors scolding me. Reporter: Why did Zeng Mengpu scold you? Sai: Isn't it all because of me? Reporter: What does this mean? Sai: When I was young, I knew Mengpu and was very close to him. He loved me very much. Later, I "led the family" to make money and promised me to Wenqing. Mengpu was certainly no match for a状元, and disappointed in love, he wrote a novel to angrily scold me and Wenqing. But Mengpu is already sixty years old this year. Reporter: Hu Die wants to ask you to act in a movie, are you willing? Sai: I am very willing to face the camera. Reporter: Last year, the Qinqiang Yisu Society came to Peiping. Is the Summer Palace they performed consistent with the facts? Sai: I went to the scene that day and saw it. What they performed about my patriotic efforts to save the country, mediating peace talks, and Li Hongzhang inviting me, etc., are all not true. What they performed about me flirting with Waldersee was especially too exaggerated and did not conform to the situation between us at the time. Reporter: Recently, Kunling Xin Yanqiu has a saying that she will adapt your life history and perform it on stage. Do you agree? Sai: I agree most. The face of the new actor is too much like my youth. So, when she came to ask me what happened, I told her everything I could. The reporter talked until dusk and then bid farewell. (14th)</p>
<h3>Yantai Product Investigation</h3>
<p>Yantai is not a large coastal port, but it is the commercial center of eastern Shandong, and transportation is quite convenient. In terms of industry, fruits, lace, hair nets, and fish are the main export products. The current situation is investigated as follows: I. Fruits: The soil in the counties of Jiaodong is loose, and the output of various crops is very abundant. Fruit planting began in the early years of the Republic of China. Later, because it was easy to sell and profitable, the number of growers increased every year. [By the 20th and 21st years of the Republic of China, the annual export reached more than 19 million catties, with a total value of more than 3 million yuan. However, in the past two years, due to wind disasters, insect pests, and farmers adhering to old methods and not knowing how to improve, the output has been greatly reduced. There are no accurate statistics for this year. The total export volume last year was only more than 14 million catties.] And the price has also fallen sharply. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, each catty could be worth 10 to 20 cents, but this year each catty is only worth 6 to 7 cents to 10 cents or more. There are more than 60 fruit companies in Yantai. Due to the business recession, many have closed down, and the heavy taxes are the deadly blow to the fruit industry. (In addition to the 3% of the business tax levied by the business tax bureau according to the amount of business, the fruit companies have to pay 5 yuan per 100 kg of customs tax, 0.75% of sea dam tax, and 10 yuan per 100 yuan value for shipping to other places.) Recently, apples from Japan have been launched on the market, and they are being sold at low prices, which has had a great impact on local fruits. II. Lace and hairnets: In the 26th year of Guangxu, an Englishman named Ma Maolan (manager of Rendeyang Store) came to Jiaodong counties to preach, and used teaching lace weaving to win over believers. At the end of Guangxu, French missionaries taught hairnets. At the same time, British taught drawn thread embroidery tablecloths. At first, the annual output was only a few hundred yuan. Since the Republic of China, it has gradually increased. The number of exports has also soared. The sales area has spread almost all over the world, especially in South America, South Africa, and Nanyang. Minshi can be called the golden age, and exports reached 15.6 million yuan. The reason why it can be sold well is nothing more than the low labor cost in our country. However, in recent years, the economies of various countries have been stretched, and these items are consumables. In order to prevent loopholes, various countries have restricted imports. Therefore, the sales of this industry have plummeted. The number of exports in the past few years and this year is only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. III. Fishery: There are many fish in the coast near Yantai, starting from Shidao in the east and ending at Jinli in the west, with a total length of more than 1,000 nautical miles. The number of fishermen is no less than 100,000. There are 200 fishing boats with a tonnage of more than 20 tons, 300 boats with 15 tons, and 500 boats with more than 10 tons, totaling about 1,600 boats (more than 100 boats from Hebei and Liaoning are also included). Every spring and autumn, during the fishing season, they come to Yantai to sell. There are now more than 80 fish companies. The annual output is 1. Yellow croaker, 140,000 to 150,000 dan, each dan is worth 4.5 yuan. 2. Taiwan fish, 15,000 dan per year, each dan is worth 5.4 yuan. 3. Knife fish, about 10,000 dan per year, each dan is worth 8 yuan. 4.鮺fish, 14,000 dan per year, each dan is worth 9 yuan. 5. Flatfish, 10,000 dan, each dan is worth 1.5 yuan. 6. Small millet ancient fish, 20,000 dan per year, each dan is worth 0.4 yuan. 7. Bighead fish, 9,000 dan per year, each dan is worth 4 yuan. 8. Other various miscellaneous fish can produce 5,000 dan per year. 9. Prawns, 20,000 dan per year, each dan is worth 8 yuan (the above numbers are from the local fishery association survey, the actual number is more than this) The total output is about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. However, since the loss of Northeast, it is difficult to compete with the Japanese. The sales route is mainly Tianhai, in addition to the 40,000 dan for local consumption and consumption in various counties of Jiaodong. There are also many in Shanghai, Ningbo, Guangdong, Shantou and other places. (Wang Gengjin, correspondent of this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Seizure of Smuggled Opium Leads to Negotiations</h3>
<p>The county Public Security Bureau recently received a secret report that opium dealer Zhu Baoquan was bringing opium back to Songjiang and throwing it down at the water tap at the West Station, with family members lying in wait to collect it in order to avoid the eyes of the military police. The bureau's special agent Yan Youzhang led two police officers to lie in wait. Sure enough, at about 8 pm on the 15th, a Shanghai train arrived in Songjiang. Special police officer Xia Dehua noticed a young man named Wu Tielin passing by the water tap with a basket. Upon inspection, it was all opium. Suddenly, an opium dealer stepped forward and tried to bribe the police with 50 yuan to release him. Xia did not accept the bribe. Seeing that there was only one special agent, the opium dealer attempted to snatch it. The police officer took out his pistol to protect himself. Zhu and Wu and others then ran away towards the station. Xia chased after them with the opium on his shoulder. As soon as he entered the platform, the military police of the third company of the first battalion of the fifth regiment stationed at the station came out to interfere and took away the seized opium. Special agent Yan's negotiations were ineffective, and he reported back to the bureau. After reporting to the bureau chief, the county anti-smoking association that night, Secretary Yao of the association, together with Section Chief Yu and Inspector Yan of the Public Security Bureau, went to visit the company commander of the military police to prove it, but there was no gain. After repeated discussions, they finally weighed the opium taken away on the spot. It weighed 18.5 jin, totaling nine packages, but they were still not allowed to take it back to the bureau. The bureau has now submitted a request to the county government for instructions on how to handle it.</p>

<h3>Five Houses Robbed in a Row in Guoxiang Township</h3>
<p>Robbery cases have been occurring frequently in Su Township recently. The major case of four villages being robbed in a row in Huangdai Township has not yet been solved. Unexpectedly, another robbery case involving five houses in a row occurred in Dafu Village, Guoxiang Township. At dawn on the 16th, more than 30 bandits suddenly arrived at the homes of farmers Zhang Yingming and others in the village. Each of them was armed with guns and weapons, broke down the doors and entered, and looted at will. After about two hours, they carried the stolen goods and left with a whistle. The loss was about 1,000 yuan, with the biggest loss at Zhang Yingming's house.</p>
<h3>Silver Company Accountant Commits Adultery and Occupies Another Man's Wife</h3>
<p>Gao Pingbo, an accountant at Dahua Silver Company on Guanqian Street in Suzhou City, is 42 years old. He is acquainted with He Wang Qinfang, the wife of He Wochen, who lives at No. 3 Daxie Lane, Donghuaqiao Lane. He rented a house at No. 8 Yinyang Lane, Qiaosikong Lane, and cohabitated with her. He Wochen found out about the affair and reported it to the police station in charge on the afternoon of the 15th. The police were dispatched and arrested both He Wang Qinfang and Gao Pingbo and sent them to the branch bureau. They were sent to the general bureau on the 16th for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Hunan Refugees Loot and Harass</h3>
<p>More than 200 Hunan refugees, looking embarrassed, arrived in the towns of Zhou Jinghuaxia and Zhou Jinglongzhu in the second district of the county the day before yesterday and lived in Zhang Zhongcheng Hall. Yesterday, the refugees harassed the Zhangbangdou area, looting property and watching over the men and women villagers one by one, not allowing them to move. Yan Guihe and other two families were robbed of 80 yuan in banknotes and one leather jacket each for men and women. After the robbery, they rushed to the house of Jin Gengshang Jin Qiaosheng to loot. The Jin family used to do cattle dealer business and recently sold two plows for 228 yuan. It happened that Qiaosheng and his son Zhiliang went to relatives' houses to have a wedding banquet on that day and were not at home, so the silver dollars were robbed. Now they are going towards Wangting.</p>
<h3>All Sections of the Wuxi Canal Completed</h3>
<p>In order to handle drought relief and work relief, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specifically allocated 1 million yuan of abandoned water conservancy bonds to dredge the rivers in Jiangnan. However, the dredging of the canal only stipulates the section from Zhenjiang Jingkou to Danyang to Wujin. The section from Wujin onwards is not included in the dredging. Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of this county, believes that the section of the canal from Wujin to Wangting, Wuxi, a total length of 80 li, has also been silted up section by section, and dredging is urgently needed. On September 20 of this year, he went to the province to request that the province allow it to be added to the list. Zhang Fulin, director of the County Construction Bureau, ordered technician Xu Fulie to bring surveyors to measure on the 1st of this month. As of yesterday, the measurement has been completed. The measurement situation is drawn into a pattern and submitted to the province for approval after everything is ready. In addition, the Construction Bureau was ordered to handle the case of conscripting labor to dredge the river. Personnel have also been dispatched to select key rivers throughout the county for measurement. The required dredging cost is about 100,000 yuan. However, the county's construction funds are limited and it is difficult to raise funds. Therefore, Zhang, the director of the Construction Bureau, drafted a plan and budget and submitted it to the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Hall for approval. After the instruction arrives in Wuxi, it will be submitted to the Construction Discussion Council for discussion. It is expected to be implemented this winter.</p>

<h3>Director of Education Bureau Detained</h3>

After receiving the order, Magistrate Wang immediately detained Director Liu and sent him to the province for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Sea Bandits Land and Kidnap Villagers</h3>
<p>Four bandit ships suddenly came to Xiaomiao Port, Qidong, at 9 pm the day before yesterday. More than 60 bandits armed with weapons landed and searched at will and kidnapped nine villagers. Huang Bingjun, the captain of the second squad of the first squadron of the Hui'an Town Security Team, learned of this and immediately joined forces with the second squadron of the Security Team to rush to suppress them and rescued four hostages. The bandits, seeing that they could not hold out, boarded the ships one after another and set sail to leave.</p>
<h3>Telegraph the Provincial Hall to Reduce Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>This county has been suffering from prolonged drought this year, and the autumn harvest is less than 40%. However, the Ministry of Finance ordered the county to collect taxes starting from 85%. Yesterday (14th), various agencies and groups telegraphed the provincial government and the Ministries of People's Affairs and Finance to reconsider and reduce the taxes. The original telegram roughly stated: This county suffered from severe drought in early summer, and the rice seedlings withered. The ditches were dry, and farming could not be done in time, resulting in a lot of barren land. Although we had timely rain in autumn, it was too late for the development period of grains. The growth of cotton was still good, but it was subjected to insect pests. The fruits were completely removed and there was no income. The severity of the disaster has not been seen since Xianfeng six years. The average annual income is less than one-fifth of the normal year. The facts are there and should not be concealed. The provincial committee has already inspected and recorded the case. At this time of convenient transportation and easy access to the people's plight, the government will surely take into account the people's suffering and be realistic when it comes to the amount of taxes. Therefore, we dare not make reckless requests. I recently learned that the Ministry of Finance ordered the county to finalize the autumn survey and set the case at 85%, which is extremely shocking. We will specifically describe the facts and now ask you to bestow vast grace and comfort the coastal areas and approve the meeting to reconsider and reduce the taxes, or send someone else to investigate and recover them in detail, so as to benefit both the public and private and emphasize the importance of tax administration.</p>

<h3>Province Orders All Counties to Hold Winter Defense</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Security Office, due to the advent of winter, all counties have followed the case to hold winter defense every year to provide security. In the past, counties such as Shenyang and Yangzhou often had cases of disaster victims抢夺ing. Recently, there have been farmer riots in Wuxian County. During this period, I am deeply afraid that unscrupulous people will take the opportunity to make trouble and disrupt the local area. It is not enough to increase vigilance in advance to maintain hidden dangers and plan safety. Therefore, seven articles of winter defense methods are specifically formulated and instructed to the county magistrates to follow, starting from the 15th of this month, supervise their subordinates to implement them earnestly, and report the implementation situation for future reference. The winter defense methods of each county are recorded as follows: 1. Essential defense, stationing essential troops in each county's original forces to provide defense. In counties with fewer security teams, if the forces are insufficient for distribution, watchtowers should be established as soon as possible to provide assistance. 2. Clear household registration, all counties that have completed the second phase of Baoterm work should be strictly implement the tasks of checking, reviewing, and sampling in accordance with the methods stipulated in Article 13 of the provincial regulations on checking household registration and compiling Baoterm. Counties that have not completed the second and third phases of work should earnestly rush to handle them in order to rectify the source. 3. Eliminate vagrants, the address of all unemployed rascals, scattered soldiers, and wandering brave should be investigated in detail and pay attention to their actions. In addition, famine victims gather easily to generate out-of-pocket actions, and precautions must be taken in advance to properly stop them. Those who borrow the name of recruitment to attract and deceive everywhere without formal orders should be arrested at any time and sent to the location for interrogation. 4. Implement inspection, rigorously check all store shops, teahouses, and restaurants, as well as brothels and smoking houses, but do not harass them, or there are illegal acts, and in order to take into account the safeguarding and establish teamwork, each district security commander should hold joint defenses in each county in the district, so as not to let the bandits flee there, and the counties that have not established a security commander should also combine with neighboring counties according to local conditions, especially to organize patrol teams and mobile patrols, so that the villains can have no gaps to take advantage of,</p>

<h3>The Fifth District's Big Knife Society is Active Again</h3>
<p>In the past, the fifth district of this county, Suyaxiang, Tuanzhuangxiang, and Xiajixiang, etc., had a Big Knife Society, which harmed the local area. Later, it was flattened after the military police painfully attacked them. Unexpectedly, the Big Knife Society disciples in these three townships, using the name of bandits, have now rekindled and their activities are abnormal. Yesterday, the Chenghuang Association in Linze Town, the fifth district, a total of more than 100 Big Knife Society disciples from these three townships, all wrapped in white towels on their heads and yellow belts on their bodies, each holding a large knife and spear, came to the town to demonstrate. When they passed the entrance of Jutaixiang on Zhongjie, one disciple danced with a large knife, confirming that he had injured villager Wu Er. The injured person was afraid that he was possessed by a god and did not dare to compare with him. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Villagers Capture Bandit Leader</h3>
<p>Sun Hesheng, a wealthy resident of the Huangqiao Township in Cixi, was coveted by bandits. At midnight the night before last, sixteen or seventeen bandits, each wielding a weapon, successively scaled the wall and entered his residence. Sun Yuhe and Sun Yongfu, members of Hesheng's clan residing in the Sun residence, had heard the noise and were lying in wait in the courtyard. Seeing a thief jump down from the wall, Yuhe immediately grabbed the thief around the waist. The thief struggled to break free and stabbed Yuhe with a sharp knife. Although Yuhe suffered multiple injuries, he endured the pain and held on tightly. Yongfu also joined in the fight. Upon hearing the commotion, the bandits outside the wall continued to scale the wall and enter, collectively attempting to seize the captured bandit from Yuhe and Yongfu. Fortunately, villagers beat gongs and gathered a crowd, causing the bandits to flee over the wall. The bandit who had been held was not able to escape and was subsequently escorted to the Cixi County Public Security Bureau. The injured Sun Yuhe was sent to Baoli Hospital for treatment. County Magistrate Cheng Yingju and Public Security Bureau Chief Lü Siyi, recognizing Sun Yuhe's bravery in capturing the thief, deemed it highly commendable and each donated from their own funds as a reward to encourage such actions.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Fire on Jiaoren Road</h3>
<p>At 12:26 AM yesterday (the 16th), a fire broke out at No. 166 Jiaoren Road, Hangzhou, because an apprentice, Zhou Songquan, knocked over a kerosene lamp while feeding pigs late at night. The fire quickly spread with violent winds, making it impossible to approach. Residents were awakened from their dreams, and there was great chaos. Fortunately, the fire brigade and various foreign fire companies rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after three hours. A total of thirty-nine shops and residences on the main street, comprising fifty buildings, were burned down. More than ten houses near the Liangdaoshan East Corridor Temple were also affected. The loss is estimated to be over 150,000, making it an unprecedented catastrophe. The men, women, old, and young of the affected families were left homeless that night, and their cries shook the sky. The Municipal Government and Public Security Bureau have dispatched personnel to provide assistance and handle the aftermath. The suspected arsonist, Fang Peiqiu, was out and had not returned, while Shen Daifang has been detained by the authorities for interrogation. Fang's wife, startled awake from her sleep, jumped out of the building in an attempt to escape, suffering severe injuries and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Illicit Affair Exposed, Cousin Killed in Revenge</h3>
<p>Wang Atang, a resident of Daixi Township in the Seventh District of Xiaoshan, had been having an affair with the wife of his cousin, Wang Arong. This was recently discovered by Wang Arong, who harbored a grudge. On the 13th of this month, as dawn was approaching, Arong, along with several accomplices, went to Atang's house and knocked on the door. Unaware of their scheme, Atang opened the door. The thugs immediately grabbed him, struck him on the head with a wooden club, causing his skull to fracture and brain matter to flow out. Atang fainted and fell to the ground. Seeing that Atang was not yet dead, the thugs stabbed him five times with a prepared bayonet, killing him instantly. The murderers fled in all directions. When the family found out, they immediately reported it to the county to issue an arrest warrant for the ringleader. The court ordered an autopsy, and the local police supervised the family in preparing the body for burial.</p>

The altar was filled with offerings, with tall white candles burning and sandalwood incense curling. The walls were covered with memorial scrolls. The most sincere and heart-wrenching among them was a couplet from the funeral arrangement office, which read: ["Death is common, enduring this moment of pain; there are things to discuss, there are facts to face, what regrets remain?"] ["Life is full of hardship, summing up his forty years of contribution; pity him for the country, pity him for the society, dare to cry for our personal loss."] Beneath the stage were piled wreaths from President Sun, Minister Kong, Mayor Wu, and others.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Consolation to the Family of Wen Hongen</h3>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Investigates Suspects in the Shi Liangcai Case</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Tang Yunsheng, a suspect arrested in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, in connection with the assassination of Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of Shen Bao, has been detained and sent to the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Shanghai Municipal Government authorities have not yet received any notification from Hangzhou regarding this matter. However, the Public Security Bureau of the six districts of this city, based on reports of the suspect's location in Shanghai, which was No. 11 Sun's Residence on Yuyuan Road, dispatched personnel to investigate. The Huadong News Agency reporter also visited yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Ying's Remarks: According to Lu Ying, head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, speaking to the Huadong News Agency reporter yesterday, regarding the arrest of a suspect in the Shi case in Hangzhou, he has not received any official notification to date, except for what he read in the newspapers. In the past, if any cases occurred in Hangzhou and the clues were related to this city, the former Director of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, He Yun, would immediately notify him by long-distance telephone. This is because any important case must be contacted in a very short time in order to be solved quickly. In this case, the arrest of the suspect Tang Yunsheng by Hangzhou has not been reported by telegram, nor has the Municipal Government authorities received any notification from Hangzhou and issued instructions to his team. Therefore, it is difficult to know whether it is reliable. However, the Detective Team is still paying close attention to assisting in the arrest of the murderers in this case.</p>
<p>Branch Bureau Investigation: Yesterday afternoon, the Public Security Bureau of the Sixth District, because the suspect in the assassination of Shi, who was arrested by Hangzhou, was at No. 11 Sun's Residence on Yuyuan Road, which is within the jurisdiction of the Caojiadu Public Security Branch Bureau, Director Wang of the Branch Bureau, in order to clarify the truth, sent personnel to investigate yesterday afternoon. According to the suspect Tang Yunsheng's wife, she reported everything, saying that Tang had been unemployed for a long time, so he was very upright and would not do anything wrong. Therefore, this arrest must be a false accusation, etc., and reported everything one by one. Later, the officers brought a photograph of Tang Yunsheng to the bureau for a reply, so that the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau could be notified according to the situation.</p>
<p>Neighbor's Account: The Huadong News Agency reporter specially went to Sun's Residence at 3 pm yesterday to investigate in detail. The residence is east of Zhaofeng Park on Yuyuan Road, just on the edge of Emeiyue Road. The house where the suspect Tang Yunsheng lived is No. 11, just in the center of the residence. The house is very old, and some parts have been renovated. When the reporter went, Tang Yunsheng's wife had already gone out. According to her neighbors, after reading the newspaper and learning that her husband had been arrested, she was very anxious. Her brother is a person who works in the police station, so she specially went to discuss the proof and rescue procedures. According to the neighbors before and after the residence, Tang Yunsheng is a very honest person. He used to work as a driver in Beijing. Later, because he had a disagreement with someone, he returned to Shanghai at the end of the lunar year last year. Since then, he has been unemployed. Recently, because he has been unemployed for a long time, he is eager to get a job, but he has tried many times and has not succeeded. His neighbor Mr. Mao, who is from Ningbo, said that Tang has a very effective bodhisattva in a temple somewhere in Hangzhou. You can go and pray for the blessing of the Buddha. Tang believed it, so he took the early train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Hangzhou on the morning of the 14th. Unexpectedly, he was arrested that day. Tang's departure from Shanghai, they can all prove it. He did set out on the 14th. Although Tang is unemployed, he recently sold a piece of land and got several thousand yuan, so he has some savings on hand. As for Tang Yunsheng's claim that he had a Hongchangxiang cigarette and paper shop in Shanghai, it may have been a misunderstanding due to panic. However, Tang's uncle, Mr. Ma, does have a hardware store, or Tang may have stated that he could go to his uncle's hardware store to investigate in order to prove his identity. There is only one wife, one son, and one daughter in Tang's family, and no other relatives.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County's Tax Reduction of 5% is Finalized</h3>
<p>The County Government orders deduction from the second phase of land tax this year</p>
<p>The autumn harvest in various districts of Shanghai County suffered from drought. After an on-site survey by members of the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments, it was proposed to reduce the land tax by 9% throughout the county. Later, an order was received from the Finance Department stating that the proposed 9% was not accurate enough, and the county was ordered to conduct a thorough review. After the county government removed 1% and attributed it to mature crops, it was submitted for approval. Now, an order has been received from the Finance Department stating that, according to the members, the autumn harvest this year can still be appropriately increased. Now, the increase in collection is only 1%, which is a very small amount and is still difficult to approve. Now, the department has increased it by 3% and changed it to a real collection of 9.5%, etc. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to preparing the real collection register and sending it to the province for filing, also issued an order to the Tax Collection Office yesterday to stamp the entire county's 5% tax reduction in the second phase of the tax payment permit this year and verify the number for reduction.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Factories in Concessions</h3>
<p>Negotiations will be reopened soon</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of inspecting factories in the concessions of this city, the Shanghai Municipal Government has proposed it several times and contacted the concession authorities. However, because the concession side is still considering it, this case has been suspended for two years. Yesterday afternoon, according to Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, speaking to reporters, the implementation of factory inspections is originally for the welfare of laborers, and it is believed that people from all countries also express sympathy. The Municipal Government has consulted with the Ministry of Industry and the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau and obtained a solution. Negotiations will be proposed soon to seek a solution within the scope of not harming sovereignty and hope to obtain results in the short term, so that concession workers can improve their work and environment.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Concerned about the Organization of the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Sending letters to county magistrates, urging them to be cautious in selecting candidates</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association of this city believes that the municipal councils of the old Ningbo counties are about to be organized, and the selection of candidates for appointed councilors should be particularly cautious. They sent letters to the county magistrates yesterday, recording the original letter as follows: Greetings, Upon investigation, the county council is the representative body of the people of the entire county, which is the basis for the people to exercise the four powers, complete autonomy, and promote constitutional government. In the stage of supporting autonomy, one-third of the candidates for councilors are appointed by the county magistrate. This is because during the period of tutelage, the first election requires a part of councilors appointed by the county magistrate to improve its organization. The importance of the appointment section is self-evident. The colleagues of our association are extremely concerned about county administration. The organization of the municipal council this time is related to local autonomy, and they are especially willing to exhaust their foolish sincerity and offer their humble opinions. It is proposed that your county magistrate carefully select fair people from all districts when appointing councilors, those who have always been respected and can enthusiastically engage in public welfare and have made achievements. Not only will your government achieve the effect of official-civilian unity in governance in the future, but also the colleagues of our association will feel the joy of responding to each other in assisting the public welfare of our hometown. The future of autonomy really depends on it. This is a special report, and I hope you will adopt and implement it. I am extremely grateful, etc.</p>

<h3>The Sixth National Goods Movement Yesterday Invited Celebrities to Give Lectures</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the propaganda week of the Sixth National Goods Movement Conference. In the early stage, the conference hired Dong Xiujia, Zhang Sumin, Yang Yinpu, and Xu Peikun from the academic circles of this city to give lectures. All of them arrived at the meeting one after another. They gave lectures one after another from 1:00 pm to 2:40 pm. At other times, there were entertainment performances by the Youth Drama Club and various primary schools. The various situations at the venue are recorded below:</p>
<p>Orderly</p>
<p>During the first two days of the conference's propaganda week, due to the lack of admission ticket restrictions, the venue was crowded. Those who arrived later had to stand in the open space outside the venue. Therefore, from the third day, the conference printed more than 1,000 admission tickets every day and gave them to the participating factories in the national goods shopping malls as gifts for selling goods to show some restrictions. Although the number of people was still large in the past two days, it was no longer crowded. The order yesterday was particularly orderly.</p>
<p>Lecture Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday's lectures began with Xu Peikun's "The National Goods Movement and the National Salvation Movement." The speech was quite long. The main idea was that promoting the national goods movement is the national salvation movement. If the 400 million people of China all buy Chinese goods, the money will not flow to foreign countries, and China will naturally become rich and strong. If China is rich and strong, isn't that saving the country? The next speaker was Dong Xiujia, who spoke on "The Problem of Promoting National Goods," briefly stating that the speaker put forward the topic for discussion today because some people misunderstood the policy of free trade, and misunderstood the mentality of buying and selling based on the quality of goods, etc. The words were mostly alert and pleasant to listen to. Then Yang Yinpu spoke on "The National Goods Movement in the Silver Tide," and Zhang Sumin spoke on "Methods of Promoting National Goods," all of which are too long to record.</p>
<p>Entertainment Program</p>
<p>Yesterday's conference entertainment started at 2:45 pm. First, the principal of Shangwen Primary School performed "The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats." The next was the Youth Drama Club's "Passionate Drama," a one-man show by artists Bao Yifei and Zhao Baoshan. Next was "Whose Grace" performed by Wanzhu Primary School, the "Winged Birds," "Bulangqi March," and "Oriental Love Song" quartet by the Minli Middle School harmonica team. Shanghai Women's Middle School Affiliated Dagang Primary School performed "Little Soldiers," "Butterfly Love Flower," and "Happy Ya" three song and dance programs. Dagang Kindergarten performed "Hey Little Soldier," "Selling Newspaper Song," "Chrysanthemums Send Mom and Dad," and "Sleep Well Baby" four programs.</p>
<h3>The Second Day of the Shanghai Municipal Horticultural Exhibition</h3>
<p>The first Horticultural Exhibition sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau of this city was held in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Yesterday was the second day. Because the festival was approaching Xiaoyang [a solar term], the weather was fine and sunny, and the visitors were very crowded. Among the products, the pyrethrum of the China Chemical Industry Society, the meat rabbits of the Dongda Farm, and the mushrooms of the Sino-American Mushroom Company are all good by-products of farmers. In addition, the various local products of Lili Company, the vegetables of the Municipal Farmers Association and the Zhenru Vegetable Farm are numerous and incredibly plump. The fruit seedlings, vegetable seeds, instruments, and medicines of Dahua Farm, as well as new-style horticultural tools, and the various famous chrysanthemums of Xi Zhangxing, Xi Yuxing, and Xiangshun Flower Garden are arranged legally. The fleshy plants of the Municipal Garden Yang Zhiyu Lu and Guan Sheng Farm are strangely shaped and have a special interest. The products of the students of Qiangshu Horticultural School, based on the natural posture of chrysanthemums, are slightly artificially tied into animal forms, which can be said to be unique. The four corners are also respectively arranged with models of the entire area and buildings of the central urban area, the panorama of the sports field, and the great library and museum. Visitors can clearly understand the situation of the central city and the construction plan of the municipal government. In the center, the prizes from all walks of life are displayed, including silver cups and shields from Mayor Wu and Director Yang, prize banners, flower baskets, etc. Yesterday, the groups who came to visit were the Zhabei Civilian Education and Training Institute, the Hunan District Farmers Association, Huangguang Primary School, Yousheng Primary School, Shenxing Primary School, as well as colleagues from the Municipal Government and various bureaus, celebrities from Shanghai, experts from all walks of life, and Shanghai citizens, constantly one after another, totaling no less than five or six thousand people. Wu Huanru, section chief of the second section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Bao Bodu, director of preparation, and others took care of the reception at the venue, and the guests were extremely satisfied.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Memorial Hospital Held a Chrysanthemum Exhibition Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Songhu Memorial Hospital in Minhang has a chrysanthemum exhibition every late autumn to raise funds to cultivate hundreds of orphans. Over the years, the management has been quite successful.

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Representatives Petitioned the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting the cancellation of rickshaw puller registration</p>
<p>The rickshaw management committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council previously issued a matter of rickshaw puller registration, which aroused the opposition of rickshaw pullers in general, because there are currently about 100,000 rickshaw pullers. If registered, more than half of the rickshaw pullers will inevitably lose their jobs, and the livelihood of the remaining 50,000 people will inevitably cause panic. At 3:00 pm yesterday, rickshaw puller representatives Chen Guoliang, Yao Shengting, Qian Youfu, and more than 20 other people went to the Public Concession Municipal Council to see Zhong Si, requesting the cancellation of the registration and requesting that the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association be managed by both labor and management, etc. Zhong Si sent Deputy Director Philip to receive them, and after learning about the details, he agreed to forward them to Director Zhong for submission to the board of directors for discussion and approval. At about 4:00 pm, the representatives said goodbye and returned.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Revises the Regulations on Medals for Special Police Officers</h3>
<p>The Chief of the Police Department of the Municipal Council suggested that the regulations on long service medals for special police officers should be slightly revised to be consistent with the regulations on medals for merchant corps. According to the current regulations, 12 years of active and effective service are required to adopt this chapter. The revised method is as follows: 1. The old system regulations are still followed; 2. At least six years of effective and active service, and the remaining period is effective reserve service, but two years are counted as one year, such as in a certain year, if there are 36 hours of mobilization service, that year will be counted. This proposal has been approved by the board of directors for implementation.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Will Ban Unlicensed Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Implementation starts on December 1</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council announced that, starting from December 1st of this year, all rickshaw pullers without licenses and those who do not wear enamel badges on their left arms will not be allowed to pull private rickshaws in the concession.</p>
<h3>New Development of Ningbo Industrial Bank</h3>
<p>Ningbo Industrial Bank was established in October of the 20th year [of the Republic, 1931]. After being issued a business license by the Ministry of Finance and Industry, it has been open for three weeks. After moving to the new address on Nanjing Road last month, the business has been very developed. Now, the bank, in view of the immaturity of my country's industry, the backwardness of the economy, and the dumping of foreign goods, which affects domestic national goods, based on the purpose of saving the country with national goods, has organized national goods floating pawn loans and opened the entire second floor, providing a free national goods temporary shopping mall jointly organized by 30 large factories. The opening was held yesterday. At the same time, the bank held a national goods savings promotion, in addition to being handled in accordance with the savings law, it is specifically aimed at using economic power to support the development of national goods enterprises, so it has been deeply praised by industrial circles. There are now more than 100 factories, which donate exquisite products to the bank and transfer them to households that promote national goods savings. It is heard that the number of national goods savings depositors was extremely crowded yesterday, and the future of national goods will benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>The Recruitment of Reserve Members for the Chinese Team of the Merchant Corps is Coming to an End</h3>
<p>43 Replenished Last Session</p>
<p>Since the summer announcement of the recruitment of reserve members for the Chinese Team of the International Merchant Corps, Chinese merchants in this city have been eager to go to the team at No. 131 Hanzhong Road, 3rd floor, to ask for chapters and register. It is now known that the team is already starting to investigate the recruits and plans to end the recruitment at the end of this month so that training can begin next month. Therefore, those who aspire to join the team in order to gain military knowledge and serve the public should register this month. The qualifications must be junior high school or above in Chinese and English, and guaranteed by reputable stores and managers. It is heard that the reserve members recruited by the team in the previous session have already completed their courses. The translators who have been added to the translation team are Li Jiaren, Zhao Weiwen, Shen Chunfang, Weng Weixian, Zhou Bingheng, Zhu Tongzhang, Fang Junde, Fang Guozheng, Zhang Dihua, Chen Zhongrong, Shen Shiliang, Lin Zhaozhen, Zhang Yunzhang, Xu Haoran, Wang Qipei, Jiang Jintang, Zheng Qingqi, Chen Shaozhen, Qu Wenda, Shao Jiaquan, Tang Rongkang, Yuan Rongxuan, Zheng Xiafei, Shen Lianfa, Wang Guangxing, Hu Kaifu, Song Zijiang, Han Zhenxin, Liang Zhongqing, Xiao Peiji, Shen Zengfan, Jia Mingyi, Shen Linshu, Zhou Zhixing, Jiang Guanliang, Wu Dawen, Zhu Yuting, Lin Jinan, Yang Cha, Wang Weifu, Zhou Yangsheng, Xing Weide, and Cao Zhiming, a total of 43 people.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Discusses Banning Disturbing Noises</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Traffic Committee heard that the Chief of the Police Department had been asked to investigate and report on the issue of traffic and other noises. The department has now prepared a written opinion, dividing the noises into those that are harmful to the public and those that only hinder a very small number of people. For the latter, only legal remedies are available, and the police department provides possible assistance. The most serious is the noise of car horns, which is expressly prohibited by Article 30 of the current traffic regulations. Since 1930, drivers have been reminded to pay special attention, and many have been sued in court, and the situation has improved at this moment, but unnecessary horn noises are still unavoidable. However, Shanghai has special circumstances, and drivers, other rickshaw pullers, and pedestrians are all factors in creating this situation. If you pay attention and control the speed when driving at night, you can really avoid using the horn. In addition, the annoying exhaust noise of motorcycles has been taken care of by the police. Other annoying noises seek legal remedies whenever possible, but it mostly depends on private initiative. After discussing this report, the Traffic Committee decided to wait for further investigation and study it again next time.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Department Consults with the Municipal Government to Realize Local Autonomy Soon</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city, based on a request from its subordinates, has consulted with the Municipal Government to realize local autonomy as soon as possible to complete the period of political tutelage. The original letter stated: [To whom it may concern, according to a report from the First District Party Department of this association, the First Branch reports that the revolutionary work phase is nearing completion, and constitutional governance is about to begin. All construction matters should be actively promoted, and the implementation of local autonomy is particularly urgent. This is to promote cooperation between the people and the government to facilitate the construction of the Three Principles of the People and the great cause of national revolution. Furthermore, at a time when the nation is in grave danger and international turmoil is intensifying, all major missions depend on the assistance of the people. Following the teachings of the late Premier to implement local autonomy is imperative. It has also been observed that various provinces and counties outside the city have already begun to implement it in sequence. Our city has also been preparing for many years and should intensify efforts to expedite its realization to benefit constitutional governance and comfort the people's livelihood. In view of this, this branch has resolved through a general meeting of party members to submit a request for consideration. It is a matter of public convenience. Based on the above, the 90th Standing Committee meeting of the subordinate association has approved the forwarding of the case. Therefore, this document is submitted to your association for review and forwarded to the Municipal Government for processing. Based on this, this case has been repeatedly submitted to the association and forwarded to your government for processing. Now, based on the previous situation, in addition to replying, a letter is sent again, hoping you will consider and handle the case together. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Government.]</p>

<h3>Murder Case on Difeng Road</h3>
<p>Tang Akun Dies from Six Axe Wounds</p>
<p>With His Last Breath, He Said the Assailants Were Mostly Acquaintances</p>
<p>- The Motive Appears to Be Related to Soil Trading -</p>
<p>A murder occurred near No. 44 Difeng Road, Caoxi Road, West Shanghai, near the British barracks in the Yanjiacun area, at about 8:20 AM yesterday morning. The victim was an investigator stationed in Shanghai for the Taicang County Public Security Bureau. The perpetrator fled and has not been apprehended. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Taking a Remarried Woman</h3>
<p>The deceased, Tang Akun (also known as Tang Yongshan), was a local resident living in a bungalow at No. 491, Xingjiapo Road, West Shanghai. His wife, Zhu, 38 years old, was remarried to Tang. The woman's former husband, Zhu Xinqing, was a hooligan who died five years ago, leaving behind a son and a daughter. The son, Fugen, is 18 years old, and the daughter, Ailian. When Zhu remarried Tang Akun, the children also came with her. Tang had considerable influence in the Caoxi Road area of West Shanghai and had accumulated significant wealth. He had a close relationship with a major soil trader named Yan in Yanjiacun, assisting him in everything. Therefore, he was even closer to Yan's nephew, Yan Chengquan, with whom he frequently interacted. However, Tang Akun was very greedy, which caused friction between the two parties.</p>
<h3>Public Servant</h3>
<p>At the end of May this year, Tang Akun, through a friend's introduction, became an investigator for the Taicang County Public Security Bureau, stationed in Shanghai for official duties. However, while nominally a public servant, he secretly continued his old ways. He had a private car for transportation, hired Xiao Houcai as his driver. Yesterday morning, after washing up, Tang ordered his driver to prepare the car and went to No. 21 Yanjiacun to visit Yan Chengquan. Upon arriving at Yan's house, he saw Yan Chengquan having breakfast. The two sat and talked for a while. After about ten minutes, Yan finished his meal, and the two walked out of Yan's house together, heading east. Tang Akun also instructed his driver to wait at the entrance and not to follow.</p>
<h3>Blood Gushing</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, when they reached the intersection of Difeng Road and the British barracks, at the boundary of the Chinese and foreign concessions, three thugs suddenly jumped out from behind Tang. One held a handgun, and two held sharp axes. Upon seeing Tang Akun, one immediately fired a shot at him, missing. Tang turned around quickly, and the two thugs with axes hacked at him. Caught off guard, he was struck in the head and immediately fell to the ground. The thugs did not let up and struck six times, targeting the left and right temples, causing the skull to crack open and blood to gush out. He was on the verge of death. Seeing their objective achieved, the assailants fled in different directions. However, no one outside noticed.</p>
<h3>Beyond Saving</h3>
<p>Fortunately, someone soon noticed and spread the word, attracting a large crowd. At the same time, Tang's driver went to investigate. He was shocked to see his master. He rushed home to report the news to Tang's wife, Zhu. Zhu rushed to the scene and found the Jing'an Temple police and the Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team, Lu Ying, already there. The perpetrators had already fled. Tang was rushed to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, but he succumbed to his injuries and died at 11:30 AM. The hospital reported the death to the police, who transferred the body to the coroner's office to await examination by the court. A felt hat belonging to the perpetrator was found at the scene and taken back to the police station for filing.</p>
<h3>Possessions</h3>
<p>While the deceased was still alive, Jing'an Temple police investigators questioned him about the appearance and clothing of the perpetrators. He claimed they were all acquaintances but was too incoherent to continue. Later, Tang's wife, Zhu, and his driver, Xiao Houcai, were summoned for questioning. The above information was revealed. However, the police considered the matter related to the Chinese area and transferred all statements to the Caoxi Road branch for handling. A wallet was found on the deceased, containing nine yuan in banknotes, a Jintan medicine box, a certificate of office for Tang Yongshan, investigator of the 14th team of the Taicang County Public Security Bureau, five business cards of Tang himself, and several pieces of white paper printed with the words [Good Cloud]. [Special Cloud]. [Cloud]. Upon examination, it was found to be paper used for packing opium. Coupled with Zhu's statement, it became clear that Tang's murder was related to opium trafficking.</p>
<h3>The Grand Opening of the National Products Sales Company Held Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Temporary Marketplace Also Opened for Business at the Same Time</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, Yu Zuoting, and Others Attended</p>
<p>The China National Products Sales Company on Nanjing Road held its grand opening at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, and the temporary marketplace also opened for business at the same time. People from all walks of life attended the opening, including Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao, Jin Runyang, Xu Jifeng, and Yu Zuoting, totaling over 500 people. Wang Xiaolai and Wu Zhihao and others cordially welcomed and entertained them. At 10:30 AM, Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou presided over the opening ceremony. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participants</p>
<p>The attendees yesterday morning included Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao, Yu Zuoting, He Bingxian, Ji Zejin, Lin Kanghou, Jin Runyang, Zhuang Songfu, Chu Huiseng, Xu Jifeng, Pan Yangyao, Hu Fengxiang, Wang Jingdong, Hong Yanbin, and others, totaling about 500 people. Wang Xiaolai and Wu Zhihao led the entire staff to cordially welcome and entertain the guests, serving tea and snacks, creating a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Opening and Tour</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou, the managing directors of the company, presided over the opening ceremony. They first invited representatives from all sectors to unveil the red silk curtain hanging over the main entrance and then went upstairs to unveil the curtain on the third floor. At that moment, firecrackers exploded outside the door, and the guests applauded and congratulated. After arriving at the venue, the grand opening ceremony began. The founder, Wang Xiaolai, reported on the establishment of the company. Then, he accompanied the guests on a tour of the temporary marketplace, which featured 30 exhibitors, including the Yapu Electric Appliance Factory and the Family Industry Society. The arrangements were compact and beautiful, and both Chinese and foreign guests competed to make purchases. It was truly impressive. The guests dispersed around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>According to the founder, Wang Xiaolai, the preparation process of the company was quite detailed. He stated that the motivation for preparing the company came during the summer of last year when the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition was held in Chicago. Our country's directors Zhang Xianglin, Zhou Guanhong, Dong Kunfan, and Shao Dehui went to the United States to participate in the exhibition. They talked to me about the fact that in recent years, our country's industries have been young and production has lagged behind, and foreign goods have invaded the market more and more. According to the Jianghai Customs report, the deficit this year has been more than 30 million, and the huge amount of leakage is alarming. Besides revitalizing industry and saving national wealth, there is no other way. If we continue to procrastinate, the vast land will become a market for foreign goods, and the prosperous people will become buyers of foreign goods. The precedents of Egypt and India should be taken as a lesson. Recently, people from all walks of life have seen the pressure of foreign forces. Although there are proposals to promote national products, the production and sales sides each have barriers and cannot achieve the effect of arms and fingers helping each other. Therefore, there was an initiative to set up the China National Products Sales Company. Since its preparation, it has been warmly supported by people from the political, business, industrial, and academic circles. Everything has been going smoothly. The National Government immediately subscribed to 50,000 yuan in shares to promote it, and the Nanjing Municipal Government subscribed to 10,000 yuan. The remaining amount was fully subscribed by all sectors. After the founding meeting was held this spring, efforts were made to expand the production business and to extend the sales efforts, in order to cultivate the foundation of national power. Among them, assisting in the establishment of the Nanjing National Products Company, investing in the Chicago Exposition, and acting as an agent for the Singapore Xinghua Goods Company are all aimed at developing domestic trade to revitalize industry. Recently, it has also joined forces with major factories to host the Thirty National Products Factory Joint Temporary Market as a pioneer in production and sales cooperation. Now, the company has received a registration order from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The board of directors and supervisors have decided to open the company. From now on, it will be based on the original plan and proceed step by step, striving to take into account both production and sales, so that the national products industry has the opportunity to develop and expand its sales power. Because it is a pioneering business, there are many details to be managed. I hope that all sectors will work hard to guide us so that we can fulfill our desire to save the country through production. This is what I hope for.</p>
<h3>Water Main Bursts, Flooding Seward Road</h3>
<p>Repaired by 4:00 PM Yesterday</p>
<p>At the intersection of Jingqing Lane, Seward Road, Hongkou, an underground water main burst with a loud crash at 3:00 AM yesterday, due to years of disrepair. Nearby residents, who were sound asleep, woke up at the loud noise. They saw that the road from Zhaofeng Road to Gongping Road was covered in water. The water pipe at the entrance of Jingqing Lane was the worst, with water surging like a tide. Residents along the street were screaming. The police at the station reported to the Jiangxi Road Water Company, which shut down the main switch. The water stopped at dawn, and the accumulated water gradually receded. At around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the company sent workers to repair the pipe. The repairs were completed by around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Opium Den Raided on Douliang'an Road</h3>
<p>Japanese Suspect Arrested and Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate for Punishment</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, detectives Ma Zhiyin, Mu Chunrong, and Fan Debu of the Tissotway Road police station, along with Western detectives, cracked down on morphine dens in three houses at No. 137, No. 138, and No. 142 Douliang'an Road. They seized morphine, heroin, and all kinds of equipment, such as four circular lead barrels (containing heroin) weighing 27 pounds, and many large and small square lead barrels and glass bottles (containing chemicals). There were also many miscellaneous items such as rattan baskets and leather boxes. A Japanese suspect was arrested on the spot and sent to the First Special District Court. The Japanese suspect was then handed over to the Japanese Consulate for disposition. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the First Special District Court sent a letter and dispatched two trucks with all the seized evidence, escorted by detectives Ma Zhiyin, Mu Chunrong, and Fan Debu, to the Nanshi Local Court. The clerk of the stolen goods warehouse personally checked each item against the list and ordered the servants to move and place them in the stolen goods warehouse for safe storage.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Agree to Divorce with Less Than Thirty Sentences</h3>
<p>The Relationship is Extremely Poor</p>
<p>Ma Peizhen, a woman from Jiading, is 27 years old this year. She was married to her fellow villager, Yin Yousheng, at the age of 17. Yin is about the same age as Ma. After marriage, they came to Shanghai and lived together at No. 23, Changxing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession. The couple had a close and loving relationship and had a son who is now eight years old. Yin worked at the Jiangnan Paper Mill. In March of this year, he was investigated for cheating and was sued in the Shanghai Local Court. After a thorough trial, Yin Yousheng was sentenced to six months in prison, which he served at the Caohejing Prison. During this time, Ma Peizhen often visited him, bringing clothes and food. However, on the 29th of last month, Yin was released after serving his sentence. After returning home, his personality changed drastically, and the relationship between the couple suddenly broke down. When Ma could not borrow money, he became violent and beat her. On the 3rd of this month, he even forced Ma to leave home and make a living on her own. At this point, Ma had no choice but to temporarily stay with relatives. She felt that her husband's treatment was too harsh, that their love was over, and that it was better to divorce and find their own way. Therefore, she hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to represent her and filed a petition with the mediation office of the Second Court, requesting that the other party be summoned to mediate a divorce. The court approved the request. Yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu summoned both parties to the seventh courtroom for mediation. The petitioner, Ma Peizhen, and her representative, lawyer Pan, appeared in court and stated the facts. The respondent, Yin Yousheng, said that since the petitioner requested a divorce, he was willing to separate unconditionally. The court verified the statements and announced that the mediation was successful. A settlement record was signed in court, and both parties and the representative lawyer signed and left. Observing the emotions of both parties, it was clear that they had reached a point of no return. Therefore, both parties made statements in court with less than thirty sentences, and the divorce case was concluded.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shouchun, Accused of Intimidating a Keeling Salesgirl, is Found Guilty</h3>
<p>Fined Eighty Yuan</p>
<p>Deng Jingming, a woman from Guangdong, is currently 23 years old and lives at No. 55, Jingxiu Road, Ximen, Nanshi. She used to work as a sales clerk in the Keeling department of Wing On Company. Last year, she met Zhang Shouchun, a local from Jiuji Wood Firm at No. 217, Jichang Road, Nanshi. Zhang is the same age as Deng, quite promiscuous, and wealthy, owning two private cars. Their friendship developed into love. Unexpectedly, Deng became pregnant after engaging in physical relations. Now in her fifth month, Zhang stopped contacting Deng. Deng felt abandoned and treated like an object. She hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to send a warning letter, stating that she would sue him, which angered Zhang. At 11:30 PM on September 20th of this year, upon learning that Deng and Pan Xingfang, who lived at No. 563, Weihaiwei Road, were leaving the Great Shanghai Theater, he hired a yellow car No. 12048 and followed them to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Maohuo Road. He got out of the car and slapped Deng twice, uttering vulgar words, calling Deng a slut and shameless. He also took out a self-defense pistol and threatened her, saying that if she sued him, he would shoot her dead. Deng reported the incident to the Chengdu Road police station, and a public prosecution was filed in the First Special District Court for intimidation and injury under Articles 319 and 293 of the Criminal Law. Zhang repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned twice by the court, and the court issued an arrest warrant. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the second criminal court. Zhang Shouchun, accompanied by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanyi, turned himself in. Deng Jingming's representative lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stated that the case had been settled, so he requested the withdrawal of the charges for the injury part, which was subject to prosecution upon complaint. As for the intimidation charge, since it was not subject to prosecution upon complaint, he also requested the police to withdraw the charge and give the defendant a chance to rehabilitate himself. All incidental private prosecutions were also withdrawn. However, police lawyer Qian Jiuyu argued that the injury charge was indeed subject to prosecution upon complaint, and the plaintiff was entitled to withdraw it according to law, but the police would not withdraw the intimidation charge under Article 319 of the Criminal Law and requested that the trial proceed according to law. Next, Deng Jingming and Zhu Zhaoqi, the driver of car No. 12048, turned themselves in to testify about the previous situation (details omitted from the previous report). When Zhang Shouchun was questioned, he admitted that he knew Deng but denied having any relationship and denied hiring a yellow car and intimidating her with a pistol that day. After mutual arguments by the two lawyers, Judge Huang ruled in court that Zhang Shouchun was guilty of threatening others with harm to life and imposed a fine of eighty yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Holds Tea Party to Welcome Mrs. Bejay from England</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred People Attend, Including Wang Xiaolai and Li Jushen</p>
<p>The Soviet Consul General in Shanghai Also Attends</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at 4:30 PM, the Chinese Child Welfare Association held a tea party at the Sun Yat-sen Hall of the Museum Road to welcome Mrs. Bejay, President of the English Child Welfare Association. Mrs. Bejay, Wang Xiaolai, Li Jushen, Kuang Fuzhuo, Wu Weide, Zhu Shaoping, the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Siber Wangke, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Xuelou, the President of the British Reuters News Agency, Ding Shujing, Guo Baoyi, Yan Fuqing, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Zhongfu, Fu Bulan, Chen Bingzhang, Chen Jicheng, Jiang Xiufeng, Liu Wenmei, Lai Pingyan, Guo Shouchun, Weng Guoxun, Lou Naixiong, Yang Chonggao, Xu Jianping, Chen Tiesheng, and others, totaling over a hundred people, attended. Dr. Kuang Fuzhuo chaired the meeting, and Xu Jianping, the General Secretary, delivered a welcome speech, saying: [Mrs. Bejay has been running the English child welfare business for many years, and her experience is very rich. During the Shanghai January 28th Incident, Mrs. Bejay specially remitted a large sum of money from England to Shanghai, so that our association could handle the relief of orphans. We are very grateful for that. Mrs. Bejay is here in Shanghai today, and we have to express our warm welcome.] Mrs. Bejay then gave a speech, saying: [I am very fortunate to be able to meet with Chinese child welfare colleagues today. During October, when your association held the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference, I was in Tokyo, Japan, attending the World Red Cross Conference. Although I could not come to participate, I felt very interested in all the news of the conference. The British Child Welfare Association was established in 1919 and was founded by Ms. Eglantine Jebb. For fifteen years, we have had facilities in the child welfare business, but we cannot talk about ideals. The last time your country had the January 28th Incident, we did our best to remit some money, just fulfilling the mutual assistance obligations of mankind. In addition to doing my best to serve the British Child Welfare Association, I also participated in the post-war relief work for adults in Soviet Russia after the World War. The best country in the world for running child welfare business is Soviet Russia. Nurseries are everywhere, which is of great benefit to ordinary workers. Today, the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai is present. In the future, you may wish to invite him to give a speech for your reference. This is my first time in Shanghai, and I know very little. I hope you will not hesitate to teach me and wish you all health and success.] Then, the attendees freely exchanged opinions, and the meeting ended at around 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the Public Concession Police and Affairs Department recently used cars equipped with wireless radios to patrol the concession area to quickly respond to robbery cases. Now, they will implement a new method to disrupt kidnapping activities. Any car equipped with this device, when a kidnapper forces the driver out and drives away, the car owner only needs to press a hidden button unnoticed. Then, it will continuously emit a wireless signal, providing the police station with the direction the car is traveling (the police station is equipped with a receiver for this signal), and it can also show when and where the car stops. This signal is emitted by the car's engine. If the car stops and the engine stops running, the signal can still continue to be emitted for forty-three minutes. If the car starts again, the signal is emitted as usual. After the police station receives the signal, it immediately notifies patrol cars and police stations via wireless radio, and they can track down and arrest the kidnappers according to the map. Even if the kidnappers drive the car to a certain location, hold the victim for ransom, and abandon the car, they will still know the location where they got out of the car, and can inquire about the kidnappers' whereabouts from nearby people, thus easily obtaining clues. If the kidnappers take the victim and escape in their own car, then the effect will naturally be limited. However, if the kidnapped person presses the button before being forced out of the car, the police station will immediately know where the kidnapping occurred, rush to the scene, and inquire about everything from eyewitnesses to engage in the arrest, without delaying time and missing the opportunity. This new device will be installed by the China Wireless Protection Company for car owners, and it is expected that this system will be implemented on January 1 next year.</p>

Chairman Peng Zican announced the reasons for the meeting.</p>
<h3>Peng Zican's Opening Speech</h3>
<p>Briefly stated, "The enthusiastic attendance of all fellow townsmen tonight is enough to show the spirit of our nation. Ms. Li Bingyan, a fellow townsman, was tragically subjected to indecent assault by the foreign shipowner Naji Shi of the Wu Yang steamer, and suffered insults innocently. We deeply regret this. Naji, as the shipowner, dared to attempt to rape a passenger, which is a heinous crime and must be severely punished by the government according to the law. We are filled with righteous indignation, so we are convening this general meeting tonight. Our sole purpose is to hope that everyone, with a spirit of self-help and helping others, will jointly take on practical responsibilities, find ways to assist the victimized fellow townsman, clear Ms. Li Bingyan of her innocent shame, and fight for a shred of dignity for Chinese women. This is the greatest significance of convening this general meeting of fellow townsmen." After the speech,</p>
<h3>Li Bingyan Takes the Stage to Report</h3>
<p>Her speech stated, "The details of the insults I suffered this time have been seen in the newspapers, and I believe everyone has already understood. The shipowner of the Wu Yang steamer attempted indecent assault three times, and his bestiality is evident. The invisible pain and mental loss I personally suffered are not worth mentioning. Therefore, I do not demand anything in the private prosecution. What I hope is to preserve the face and morality of the women of our entire country, and not be destroyed and bullied by foreign beasts. I also hope that my beloved fellow townsmen in Shanghai, with the spirit of revolution, will find ways to expel this public enemy of the shipowner Naji Shi, who is destroying the face of women in our country. Then my personal shame can be cleared, and the reputation and morality of Chinese women can be preserved."

The committee address is located in the Zhongshan Fellow Townsmen's Association on Qiujiang Road. Second, use the name of the general meeting to cable the government to strictly punish the shipowner.</p>
<h3>The General Meeting's Telegram Was Sent That Night</h3>
<p>The original text is as follows: To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, greetings. Ms. Li Bingyan, a doctor from our county, boarded the China Merchants' Wu Yang steamer from Guangdong to Shanghai on the day of this month. While passing through Shantou, the ship docked at sea. At about 1:00 AM, the shipowner Naji Shi (Norwegian) sneaked into the first-class cabin with the intention of indecent assault. Although Ms. Li was fortunate enough not to be defiled, she was subjected to major insults. The harm to Ms. Li personally is small, but the damage to the face of women in our country is great. Moreover, Naji, as the shipowner, bears great responsibility for the safety of navigation and the lives of passengers. Now, he does not know how to set an example and attempts to rape passengers, acting like a beast. Then it can be seen that he neglects his duties every day. This kind of shipowner who is not human must be strictly investigated and punished. Seeing the situation, we are filled with righteous indignation. In order to protect our fellow townsmen and safeguard the women of our country, we are forced to take on the responsibility of assistance and prepare to sacrifice for the sake of justice. After discussion at the general meeting of Zhongshan fellow townsmen in Shanghai held today, it was unanimously resolved to cable the authorities to strictly punish them according to the law. Therefore, we respectfully send this telegram, and earnestly request that the主管機關 competent authorities immediately dismiss and investigate the shipowner in order to uphold the national law and rectify the people's hearts. In closing, we are filled with grief and indignation as we await your orders. The presidium of the Zhongshan Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai, Wu Ziyuan, Peng Zican, Zheng Wenqin, etc., and all the fellow townsmen in Shanghai jointly call for deletion and printing.</p>
<h3>The Shipowner Decides to Suspend His Duties First</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Navigation Administration Bureau has sent personnel to investigate the truth of the case and has decided that once the Wu Yang steamer returns to Shanghai from Qingdao, the Yuan'an Shipping Company will be ordered to suspend the shipowner Naji Shi's duties first, pending investigation.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Does Not Allow the Release of Balloons in the Concession</h3>
<p>The Meihua Real Estate Company of this city, for the purpose of spreading advertisements, plans to release a light balloon from the roof of the new vegetable market on Meiboge Road, with a volume of about 1,080 cubic feet.

The board of directors adopted the committee's opinion yesterday and could not approve the company's request.</p>
<h3>The Postal Agency's Messengers are Limited to Terminating Their Operations, the Ministry of Communications Does Not Allow Accommodation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reply to the Shaoxing Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in order to unify the postal service, issued an order to all provinces and cities to ban private postal agencies by the end of this year. The Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai, at the request of the messengers, presented a request to the Ministry of Communications on behalf of the messengers, requesting accommodation. The Ministry of Communications replied to the association yesterday, not allowing the request. The original reply stated, "Received, it has been noted that the banning of private postal agencies is a necessary measure to unify the postal service. The Ministry has already clearly set a deadline and the Executive Yuan has repeatedly issued orders in each case. The only difference between postal messengers and private postal agencies is whether they have fixed business premises, but the hindrance to the postal service caused by their business is the same as that of private postal agencies. Since private postal agencies have been banned, postal messengers cannot be an exception. Moreover, since the case has been notified, it is not appropriate to revoke it. It is hoped that your association will consider the purpose of the country's unified postal service and inform the messengers to comply with the order and end their operations as scheduled."</p>

<h3>An Unnamed Man Committed Suicide by Throwing Himself into the River from a Gasoline Boat</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, an unnamed man hired a No. 8 gasoline boat from a certain ferry company to cruise the Huangpu River. He paid two yuan, but refused to sign his name.

<h3>Chen Xin, Who Opened Fire at a Brothel, Was Found to Have Caused Trouble Due to Alcohol Consumption</h3>
<p>The Victim Did Not Arrive, Rescheduled for Another Trial</p>
<p>Chen Xin, an employee of the Yifeng Enamel Factory in Shanghai, went out for a social gathering at the Huanqiu Red Brothel in Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, at 11:45 PM on the 8th of this month. He went to the Lihua Brothel in Fuxiang Lane with the prostitute Lihua Laoqi (i.e., Lu Aiying). Unexpectedly, Chen took out a pistol and fired a shot, hitting the leg of Zhang Sujuan, a prostitute in the same brothel. Chen was immediately arrested by the detectives and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye took the bench in the First Criminal Court for interrogation. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Zhang Sujuan, who was injured in this case, was still unable to walk and could not attend the court. After investigation, it was found that the defendant was indeed intoxicated on that day. As for the defendant's previous statement that the plaintiff prostitute Lu Aiying had gathered gangsters to extort money, the investigation found that it was not true. The reason why the defendant made this statement was because he was instructed by other prisoners in the waiting room, saying that if he admitted to firing the gun, he would be convicted, so it would be better to pretend to be defending against extortion in order to avoid punishment. Since Zhang Sujuan did not attend the court today, he requested a postponement. Chen Xin's供 stated that he was indeed confused and did not know anything about the shooting. The previous statements were also caused by confusion. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him and requested bail. Judge Qian verified the供 and ordered Chen Xin to be sent back to prison for another trial.</p>

They were arrested and 229 copper coins and copper corners were confiscated in a rattan basket in room 45 of the Hongxiang Hotel and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning.

He committed suicide by poisoning that night. At 0:30 PM the next day, the tea room waiter Shen Qiaosheng discovered it and reported it to the police station. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but because the poison was too deep, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 7:10 PM on the 15th. The hospital notified the French police station to send detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for examination. At the same time, according to the address on the suicide note, the family was notified. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court and appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, to visit the hall at noon to examine the body. The wife of the deceased, Cai Zhu, learned of her husband's suicide and fainted instantly. She was too anxious to attend the case and was unable to do so. Her nephew, Cai Runsheng, attended on her behalf and requested to claim the body for burial. The official questioned Shen Qiaosheng, the tea room waiter of the Dazhong Hotel, about the circumstances of the discovery and then ruled that Shen Xinji, i.e., Cai Caiwen, had committed suicide by poisoning.

He combed his hair in front of the mirror again and again, and finally opened his suitcase and changed into clean clothes. He was all ready, but looking at his watch, it was not yet six o'clock. He thought to himself, never mind, I'll just go to Shi Lian's room and wait. Unexpectedly, the man named Li was very punctual. At this time, he locked the door and left a message with the tea room, promising to be back before seven o'clock. Jia Duocai didn't want to arrive too early, so he had to walk out of the yard. He knew that Wangjia Lane was outside the back door of this Little Western Paradise, so he walked towards the back door. When it was getting dark. Women who are fond of twilight. Since ancient times, they have felt that this time is not very enjoyable, so that Miss Yueying, could not escape the custom, came to the front door to look around to relieve her troubles. Jia Duocai walked out, and the two of them happened to bump into each other. He had seen her a few times, of course he recognized her, and immediately blushed and lowered her head. Jia Duocai didn't care, he stared at her for a while, and whispered: Hey! Aren't you supposed to meet in Mr. Li's room? Why haven't you come over yet? Yueying saw that he was just staring at her, and she was already a little embarrassed. He asked such a question out of nowhere, and she didn't know where he was coming from. She immediately turned around and ran inside. When she left, she seemed to puff out her cheeks and give him a fierce stare. Jia Duocai thought to himself, strange, Li Shilian introduced her to me, why does she seem angry with me? Oh, Li Shilian must have spent money in front of them. If it's for this little thing, it doesn't matter. Mr. Jia is not a person who can't afford to spend money. Thinking this, he couldn't help but stand at the back door in a daze. But that shrewd Sister Hu had already seen it inside, and immediately ran out with a smile and hooked her head twice at Jia Duocai, asking: Are you not a guest of the Little Western Paradise?

<h3>The Heroic Courtesan Li Yaxian</h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Yuchou</p>
<p>Beside the Liushui Bridge in Yangzhou, there is a tomb of the heroic courtesan Li Yaxian. Regarding Li Yaxian's story, according to local people, there is a sad and moving story, which is now written below: It is said that Li Yaxian was a famous courtesan in the late Ming Dynasty. When she set up shop in Yangzhou, her reputation rose like a magpie. At that time, there happened to be a playboy who was doing business in this state. His subordinates, in order to please their young master, brought him into the brothel, meaning to make him happy and forget to return, so they could cheat him from it! Sure enough, after the young master met Li Yaxian, he hid in her boudoir all day long. Not only did he not ask about the shop's affairs, but he had also put the matter of reading out of his mind. Although Li Yaxian had repeatedly advised him, he was immersed in the river of love, how could he wake up?</p>
<p>Before long, when it was almost time for the exam, the young master's father wrote several letters in succession to urge him to take the exam, but he still lingered and refused to go. One night, Li Yaxian suddenly asked the young master: [Why do you love me so much?] The young master said: [Beautiful eyes and a charming smile!] When Li Yaxian heard this, she immediately used a needle to poke out her eyes, and said to the young master: [I dare not delay the young master's future with the love of a child. I hope the young master will strive to love himself! Moreover, my body already belongs to the young master, and I vow not to marry another. I hope the young master will not think of me!] After speaking, she took off her finery and hid in the room inside, refusing to see the young master again.</p>
<p>After a few months, the young master passed the imperial examination and went straight up, and returned to Yangzhou. Thus, lovers finally became husband and wife. Later, after she died, she was buried at the Liushui Bridge!</p>
<h3>Barber Shop Daughter</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Liang</p>
<p>Quietly, from midnight, waking up from a dream on a blue wild duck down pillow. That honeyed smile, seems to appear vaguely within the resting nerves.</p>
<p>It was unintentionally walking into that barber shop, white door and windows spinning red, white, blue - three-color markings. It was also unintentionally, from the barbers' Yangzhou-accented way of addressing, that I knew that the girl sitting in the innermost chair, knitting purple velvet yarn in her hands, was the daughter of this barber shop.</p>
<p>Her age, was roughly estimated by me from the two large glass mirrors on the walls, seventeen or eighteen perhaps? Fair face, ink-black eyebrows that had not been artificially dyed. Eyes like Garbo's eyes, oily black sideburns sheltering two jade-carved ears. Where had I seen her before? That most unforgettable ripe cherry-like mouth with cracks, so exquisitely placed below an eagle's beak of a nose.</p>
<p>In the lust-filled dance halls? No! In the rough-hewn ballrooms? No! Perhaps in a refreshing park after the rain? But I have never met such a gentle and simple girl in any park. ...Oh! Except for the lilac with dew by the fence.</p>
<p>When white-clad person perfume and fragrant orchid lather were applied to the back of my head and face, she glanced at me in the large glass mirror. The exchange of sight stirred up the spring waves of love. I often leave my ambition behind my reason, I always use the frightening form of a skeleton to block the attack of lust. However, when I passed by her to go to the washbasin to wash my hair, and threw her yarn ball on the ground, and she instead said to me [Sir, did I scare you?]. I indeed almost lost all the inspiration of reason.</p>
<p>[Won't it be too dirty to knit? Heh heh...] I said apologetically to her, probing my wet hair.</p>
<p>[Even if it's dirty, you won't be able to tell, this is purple yarn!] At the moment the cherry parted, the honeyed smile burst out following. A bunch of gentle lilacs smiling in the gentle sunshine, immersed in the morning dew.</p>
<p>However, it is midnight, and the back of my head, which has had its hair cut short, is the most nervous. Thinking of the barber shop girl's spirit during the day, even the soft blue wild duck down pillow does not allow me to dream again.</p>
<h3>Ge Gongzi</h3>
<p>— Written by Hua Ying</p>
<p>I've been friends with Ge Gongzi for several years. But what kind of person he is, I have never asked. But his personality, I understand it better than I need to.</p>
<p>The first thing about him is that he is refreshing. He simply treats money like waste paper. As long as someone flatters him a few times, he will take out the Mac Mac sales invoice wrapped around his waist to treat guests. So he usually has many days with money. But he doesn't have many friends. Simply sparse like morning stars. Including me, there are only three or four.</p>
<p>Because I went to Nanjing and was delayed for more than half a year, I haven't met him. Now that I'm back in Shanghai, I haven't bothered to visit him. One night, I met him unexpectedly on the road. I only learned that he had moved. After a few perfunctory words, we parted.</p>
<p>One day, he suddenly called me and invited me to X hotel for a drink. I went on time. He was already impatient and had drunk many cups of wine alone. He never used to drink. Now his alcohol tolerance has suddenly increased. I couldn't help but ask him in surprise:</p>
<p>[Why are you drinking now?]</p>
<p>He smiled. It's been half a year since I was with him. He has indeed changed. And he doesn't say much. But looking at the way he drinks, he seems to be able to drink a hundred cups without getting drunk. Like Li Bai in those days. Although I was drinking with him, I didn't know what to say. I just remained silent until we finished two bottles of aged rice wine. Only then did he say:</p>
<p>[Life is for enjoyment. Drinking, sleeping, truly happiness!]</p>
<p>I really don't understand how he changed. And why he is so discouraged. I really don't know where to start understanding. His personality was always easy to understand. Now it's like he's been handed over. Completely clueless.</p>
<p>Until I ran out of the restaurant. He said another sentence: [Goodbye!]</p>
<p>I stared blankly at his back as he disappeared into the crowd.........</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Kewei)</p>
<p>On a cold day, on the street, I only see people walking towards the sunny side, and the side without sunshine becomes very deserted. From this, I can test that people's psychology is to be snobbish!</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Fruits in Shandong</h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>Although fruits are produced naturally, they also require artificial cultivation and planting. Only the fresh fruits that are produced have excellent results, fresh and flavorful, fragrant in quality, large and abundant, can make people love them. Recently, international trade has become more prosperous day by day. European and American countries transport large quantities of their produced fruits to our country. The annual outflow, no less than several million yuan, is just the American oranges, according to customs statistics, the amount imported in half a year, has been enough to alarm. What's more, there are other kinds of fruits, so this fruit thing, has become an important production in recent years, can not be ignored.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of fruits, no less than a hundred kinds. There are also the same kind of fruits, because of the different places of production, the taste will be absolutely different. Therefore, the place of production of fruits must be extremely careful. Among the fruits produced in our country, all the kinds that are famous throughout the country, are mostly named after the place of production. That is, this kind of fruit, must be produced in this place, is the fresh and delicious, this is probably the difference in geology, and the difference in varieties, before there is this kind of scene. Among the Shandong province of our country, most of the fruits produced in various places are famous throughout the country, and are rare delicacies. Although other provinces also have places that produce famous fruits. But there are not as many and famous as in Shandong province, so it can be said that the fruits produced in our country, are in Shandong province.</p>
<p>Feicheng Peach: The peaches produced in Feicheng, are called Feicheng Peach, who wouldn't say so? As long as people who have eaten Feicheng Peach, always remember it when peaches are on the market. The quality and quantity of Feicheng peaches produced in Feicheng, is beyond expectation. There are some that are as big as a rice bowl, and the weight can be half a catty. Its size can be imagined. The taste is fresh, sweet and fragrant, and the juice flows smoothly as soon as it enters the mouth. You can drill a small hole outside the skin, suck it with your mouth, suck up the peach juice, leaving only a layer of peach skin, and a peach pit. The color is also very beautiful, jade color with cinnabar spots. It is a pity that this kind of Feicheng peach is not easy to store, so the South is not easy to taste.</p>
<p>Laiyang Pear: When it comes to Laiyang pear, everyone knows that it is the best kind of pear. Sweet and fresh, tender and refreshing. Among the pears, there may be no one that can surpass it. This kind of pear, is produced in Laiyang County in Shandong Province, and is called Laiyang pear. In autumn, the fruit shops, have to hang up signs, writing Laiyang pear on the market, as a call. The fame of this kind of pear can be imagined.</p>
<p>Dezhou Watermelon: Shandong province, there are many places that produce watermelons, but the most famous one, is only the one produced in Dezhou. The style of watermelon, is a pillow shape, commonly known as pillow melon. The color has red, yellow, and white, three kinds, with red being the most, and the best. The weight is between ten and twenty catties. The melon juice is abundant, and its sweetness is like honey. It is a rare delicacy. It is a pity that this kind of Dezhou melon, after being moved to other places, the melon taste changes, probably because of the soil quality. Because the production is not much, the demand is greater than the supply, the price is not very cheap, it takes at least half a yuan per piece, it is not something that ordinary poor people can taste.</p>
<p>Rose Grape: Rose grapes, are produced in Yantai, because the taste has a rose fragrance, so it is called rose grape. The color is very bright purple. On each branch, dozens of grapes are tied like falling beads, very cute. The skin is unusually soft and thin. When you eat it, it doesn't mix with any sour taste. You only feel a burst of rose fragrance, which penetrates your head, and it is as sweet as honey. Compared with the foreign grapes shipped from the United States, it is a hundred times better. In the mountainous area of Yantai, there are so many people who plant rose grapes. Therefore, the production is also large. Many of the raw materials for domestic wine and grape juice are purchased from Yantai. The taste of the wine and juice made from rose grapes as raw materials is incomparably better than that of grapes produced in Henan Province as raw materials.</p>
<p>Yantai Apple: In addition to grapes, Yantai also produces apples. In any fruit store in the South, you can always see the Yantai apple sign, which is naturally a famous product. The color is more elegant and beautiful than the Jinshan apple, and the taste is also sweet and fragrant, not as sour and astringent as the Jinshan apple ship.</p>
<p>The above are all the more famous fruits in Shandong Province, and they are also delicacies famous throughout the country. In addition to this, the production of fruits is everywhere, but it is not as famous and delicious as the above.</p>
<h3>The Misty Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But in any case, the Empress Dowager had never shown even the slightest sign of dissatisfaction. She was obviously very satisfied.</p>
<p>After sitting in the side hall for a while, the Empress Dowager decided to take a nap. She always slept for two or three hours. Today she was even more tired than usual, so she might sleep even longer. After she fell asleep, we would leave only one person who happened to be on duty to wait for her to wake up and call us. The other seven of us would all retreat to rest. The two side halls I mentioned earlier were the residences of our eight female officials. Because everyone was very tired, they didn't have time to think about anything else, and hurriedly went to the residences to rest. Of course, I myself was also very tired, but this new environment gave me a very strong stimulus, making my nerves very excited, and I absolutely couldn't close my eyes to sleep. Therefore, I readily gave up the idea of taking a nap, and lingered alone in the long corridor outside, intending to get to know the scenery around here more clearly. However, I didn't dare to go too far, maybe the Empress Dowager would wake up suddenly, or she would think of me as soon as she woke up, and ask me to do something for her, which no one dared to say for sure would not happen. So I could only wander around this long corridor, looking around as far as my eyes could see. Although all I could see was a part of the palace, I had a general idea, and I could explain the architectural style of these palaces in a few simple words. First, it had many courtyards, and each courtyard was surrounded by many palaces on three or four sides. Second, outside these palaces, there must be a long corridor that was tightly connected to each other, so that they could be turned around. Together, they formed a small labyrinth pattern. Of course, this architectural style would no longer attract any special attention from me. (176)</p>

<h3>Preparations for the China-Italy Cultural Association</h3>
<p>China and Italy, as two great ancient countries in Asia and Europe, can be called representatives of Eastern and Western culture. China's representative Eastern culture, its ability to disseminate in Europe, owes a lot to the pioneering efforts of Marco Polo. In recent years, Sino-Italian relations have become closer day by day. For example, China has repeatedly sent educational, military, aviation, and transportation investigation groups, Xu Beihong's exhibition, and government personnel arriving in Italy, which were warmly welcomed by the Italian government and public. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini personally received them, urging close cooperation between the two great ancient civilizations. Recently, the embassies of the two countries have been upgraded, and the Roman Oriental Academy has asked the Chinese government to send students. The exchange of professors between the two countries is also underway. The Roman China-Italy Association [ligna ltalo cinesl] was established three years ago. Sino-Italian relations are developing day by day, and cultural communication between the two countries needs more active organization.

<h3>Liu Zhan'en Discusses Prohibiting Students from Watching Inappropriate Movies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Federation, in order to rectify the academic atmosphere, has prohibited college students from dancing, and the presidents of various universities have also expressed their support. As a result, students are rarely seen in dance halls. A reporter visited Liu Zhan'en, President of Shanghai University, yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to Liu, Shanghai University strictly prohibits dancing, and professors also set an example by not stepping into dance halls. Moreover, because Shanghai University is relatively far from Shanghai, teachers and students must live on campus, and the gate control is also extremely strict, so there has never been a trend of dancing. What I am currently concerned about is the arbitrary screening of inappropriate movies. I intend to prohibit students from watching inappropriate movies, because young people have weak wills, and if they are affected by bad movies, they are very likely to go astray. In recent years, romantic and fantastical movies have had a great impact on people's morals and health. Shanghai University has now prohibited students from watching inappropriate movies, and is planning to negotiate with various countries to prohibit the import of inappropriate movies into China. I hope Chinese film merchants will shoot more educational films.</p>

<h3>Soochow University Holds Three Ceremonies Today</h3>

For example, the school's swimming pool is rare among universities in East China. Now, Dr. Yang Yongqing, the president of the school, believes that the existing gym is too small, so he specially asked the board of directors and old students to assist in building a gymnasium, which covers an area of 160 square feet and can accommodate 2,000 people. Today (the 17th), the groundbreaking ceremony will be held at the school. At the same time, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new girls' dormitory will also be held. It is reported that the school also plans to recruit female students in the high school department starting next semester, so the dormitory is still insufficient. In addition, Chen Tingrui, a famous lawyer and alumnus of the school, donated a large clock with four faces to commemorate his son, Mingda, worth more than 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Financial: January Gold Market Opens with a Peaceful Trend</h3>
<p>Exchange Rate Restricts Buying Interest, Difficult to Boost</p>
<p>Even with Swap Adjustments, Still Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stable at the opening due to unsatisfactory silver prices and rising pure gold prices. However, it quickly declined after reaching a high due to the strengthening exchange rate. In the end, the overall trend was peaceful and uneventful due to the Central Bank's efforts to sell, although foreign banks were all buying. According to foreign news, London spot and American banks both shrunk, while futures silver prices increased. London raw gold rose one penny, and exchange rates opened weak but closed strong. Over-the-counter forward trading opened at 77 yuan, higher than the previous close. However, due to the swap rate being advanced by the shorts by 4 yuan, confidence did not improve. As a result, supply remained abundant at the highs, leading to downstream pressure. Although the market stabilized slightly after the Central Bank's posted rates were revealed, with British and American rates unchanged and customs gold rising one cent, and the standard gold price increased to 1003.6 yuan, the overall trend remained weak. The Central Bank intervened with sales, immediately hardening the domestic market, and gold market buying interest gradually subsided, leading to a decline. However, bargain hunters were still active, and short covering was also prevalent, allowing the market to maintain itself. However, the exchange rate remained strong, with Sassoon and National Goods both having selling interest, making it difficult for Chinese merchants to buy. The gold market thus entered a state of fluctuation. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, further stabilizing the situation. After the announcement, general sellers were disappointed with the unchanged equalization tax, slightly stabilizing confidence, allowing buyers to be slightly active. Although the Central Bank and National Goods sold, foreign banks were quite interested in buying, making it difficult for Chinese merchants to buy in. The gold price once rose, but ultimately fell after rising due to the strengthening exchange rate and abundant supply at the highs. The market situation was even more mediocre at midday, fluctuating endlessly. Trading within the exchange was sluggish, with no special changes. In the afternoon, the market was initially firm due to rumors that a major short was willing to advance. However, it declined after the Central Bank continued to sell, making the exchange rate difficult to be optimistic about. Indian silver was reported to have fallen by three annas, but it still struggled. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank sold again to the banking sector, with the American dollar forward rate already at 34.0625 yuan, dampening sentiment and leading to another decline. However, the market trend was mediocre, with no changes. Finally, Indian silver fell again by a small three annas, stabilizing the situation. The overall result for the day was peaceful, but when calculated with the swap rate being advanced by the shorts, it showed a continuous decline, with market sentiment inevitably suppressed by the Central Bank and the underlying trend quite weak. The swap discount was still above 3 yuan, but major shorts had already advanced. A summary of the day's market situation is provided below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 975.7 yuan, a rise of 2.1 yuan from the previous close, as the swap rate was advanced by the shorts on the January contract, warranting a higher opening. Fuxing and Yonghengxing rose to 7 yuan, while Shenkang, Dafa, Yongfuxing, and Yonghuixiang sold contracts, retreating to 3 yuan. Hengyu and Yifengyongda rose to 5 yuan. Fuxing, Yongheng, Yumu, Yongzhentai, Huixiang, Yuqingyongdalian sold off, while Pan'gen Zhenjin, despite buying American dollars at 0.9375 yuan forward, still fell to 2.5 yuan. Hengchang and Yifengyongda bought at the lows, rising to 4.2 yuan. Fuxing, Yongheng, Yufu, and Yureng were still selling, falling to 2 yuan. Mitsui had already sold January American dollars at 375 yuan, 34 yuan, and there were still sellers. Sentiment was still stable. Dingkang, Yifengyong, Richang, Yumu, Yongdafa, Yongdadecheng, Yuanchangyongdingchang, and Tianfengyong all bought contracts. Upon learning that the HSBC posted rate was flat for British pounds but only rose by 0.0625 for American dollars, gradually rising, Fuxingyong returned to buy, but with no suppliers, it actually rose to 5.6 yuan. Tianfengyong Lifuxingyongfuyuzhaofengchang sold at the highs. Sassoon and National Goods continued to have selling interest, retreating to 2.8 yuan. The announcement of the unchanged silver equalization tax disappointed the sellers, and Yumu, Yongdadecheng rose to 4.5 yuan. Dingkangfuxing and Yonglihengyu Tongfu and others were still selling, lowering the price to 3.1 yuan. Later, with foreign banks still having buying interest and limited chips in the market, Yumu, Yongdingkang, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu Shunmao Qingyudafayongfuxingyong and others successively bought, rising to 8 yuan. Yifengyong Tongxinyong Hongxingfuyu Qingyu sold off, and the domestic market loosened again, falling back to 4.2 yuan. After this, the overall trend was mediocre and sentiment extremely stable. Fuxingyong Huixiang and others advanced and retreated, and there were few transactions in the market, lacking special changes, fluctuating around 5 yuan. The midday close was 974.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 975 yuan, with the sale at 4.8 yuan. Rumors suddenly spread in the market that a certain party was willing to swap. Although the Central Bank sold January American dollars to Mitsui at 34 yuan, it was difficult to close out. Yumu Yongfuxingyong Fuchang Qianchangxiang Yonganlai advanced, rising to 7.2 yuan. Dalianbang and Yichengyuxin Xiangyuankang Xiangdadecheng Fuxingyonglai sold, gradually declining, and the Central Bank sold March American dollars to Mackay at 34 yuan, retreating to 4.4 yuan. At this time, there was quite a bit of struggle, and Hengyu Fuchang Qingyu and others were still buying. Bombay fell by 3.3.3 annas, but it rose back to 6 yuan. Unfortunately, the Central Bank's selling intention did not abate, and it sold 0.0625 yuan in March American dollars to Zhejiang, and Dafayong Fuxingyong Yumu Yuanheng Yuankangxiang and others supplied contracts, falling to 3 yuan. Dafayong and others bought at the lows, and then rose back to 4.6 yuan. Yumu Yongrichang Qianchangxiang sold again. The Central Bank issued British pounds in January American dollars at 0.0625 yuan, retreating to 3.2 yuan. Bombay fell again by 3.3.3 annas. Fuyu Dadecheng advanced contracts, and then rose to 4.8 yuan. The closing price was Jun 74.6 yuan. After the close, it was lower because of Bingxing's sale of contracts. Then Yicheng Fuxingyong and others slightly advanced, and finally rose to over 5 yuan. The highest price during the day was 978 yuan, and the lowest price was 972 yuan, with a fluctuation of 6 yuan. The result was a slight rise of 1 yuan compared to the previous close. If the swap calculation is added, it still fell by more than 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 1003.6 yuan for the Central Bank's standard gold price. According to the closing price, it was approximately 29 yuan lower, slightly less than the previous close. The old standard for November, due to HSBC's American exchange rate rising by 0.0625 to 33.3125 yuan, combined with a standard gold price of more than 1038 yuan. The registered price for this month is 970 yuan, 972 yuan for December, 975 yuan for January, 970 yuan for the morning supplement, and the same price in the afternoon. The price of red gold is calculated at 980.7 yuan, about 5 yuan more. There is a lack of sellers for spot goods, as the swap rate is being advanced by the shorts by 3-4 yuan, and the water has retreated to 6.5 yuan, making it difficult for the Tianjin gang to supply. At the opening, the swap rate was still being advanced by the shorts by 3.5 yuan to 4 yuan, but it became cheaper due to more advances. Futaiheng made efforts to advance more than 1,000 contracts, and Hengyu Yuqingyongxiangfeng and others also advanced. Dachanxiang Xianghe Jiatai Zhengchang and others, although there were offerings, were difficult to maintain, retreating to 3.23 yuan. In the afternoon, due to rumors, the multiple parties' mentality was relatively stable. Hengchangyong eagerly wanted to advance at a high price, and Yili and Ruryu and others advanced a total of 210 contracts, retreating to 3 yuan. Chunyuanyong and others were happy to offer, and they recovered again. Qianchangxiang advanced, Hengyu Shisizhen, and it had risen to 3.6 yuan. The number of contracts for December was reduced to 9,107, with a total of 32 multiple parties and 12 short parties. Yuqingyong's short position had been completely cleared.</p>
<p>Trading within the exchange was peaceful, as the Central Bank and banks were doing ticket placement, making it difficult for Chinese merchants to buy in, and arbitrageurs were unable to be active. Statistics show that Hengyu Dafayong Hongkangyong Yingxiang Yuxin Xiang Dingkang Xiangfeng Shunmao Dingchang Dingtai Ruikang Dadecheng and others were on the selling side, while Fuxingyong Fuchang Yumu Yongtianfengyong Hengchangyong Jiarun Tongtaichang Fuyu Wanxingshunli and others were on the buying side.

HSBC's posted exchange rates were released, with British pounds flat and American dollars up by only 0.0625, with no great impact. Sassoon National Goods and the Central Bank continued to have selling intentions, but banks were quite interested in buying. The announcement of the unchanged silver equalization tax slightly calmed the psychology of Chinese merchants, and they slightly made purchases in reverse, but it was not easy to succeed, causing the process to trend towards flatness. However, the underlying trend was still difficult to be optimistic about due to the supply from the Central Bank and others. In the afternoon, the Central Bank continued to sell, but foreign banks still bought, and Chinese merchants sought to close out but were unable to obtain it, and the afternoon market was still good.

<h3>Outflow of Silver Dollars and High Interest Rates Reappear</h3>

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Suddenly Experiences a Violent Downturn</h3>
<p>--A decline of 2-3 jiao to over 1 yuan--</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a strange downturn. It was rumored that a large amount of silver dollars was being exported again, and the interest rate for silver dollar loans rose to 1.6%, and the draft interest rate rose to 1.8%. It was said that a certain financial sector was eating in, causing the silver supply to suddenly tighten, and there was talk of a high interest rate for silver dollar loans in the future, so the bulls showed signs of floating, leading to a downward trend throughout the day. Among them, only the 正六 in this month stood out with a unique banner, staying at the 70 yuan mark throughout. This was because No. 78 always absorbed at a price of 70 yuan, and the demand was extremely high. According to No. 78, the original bull, this additional stake, and the approaching delivery period, naturally have the strength, otherwise there is absolutely no foolish thing, and provide sacrifice in vain. The trend is not necessarily able to rise for the time being. The situation yesterday, from morning to night, was completely downward, with the most severe decline in the裁兵. 正六 only fell 2-3 jiao. The sellers were the most abundant with No. 4, 11, 52, and 61, etc. There were many advanced households with numbers like 38, 47, and 53. No. 78 specializes in 正六 this month, and is not more than a pillar in the 70 yuan mark. If the interest rate on silver dollars does not return, we will not be optimistic about the short term. Market prices resulted in a drop of 2-3 jiao to over 1 yuan, and the total number of transactions was estimated at about 25 million. The result of the rise and fall is shown in the comparison table on the left (Unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Continue to Sell and Auction Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to weaken, because foreign merchants continued to sell, the counter was relaxed, and at the same time, spot cotton yarn sales were more sluggish, and sentiment was slightly weaker. However, the amount and acceptance of the goods of a certain company have not yet been decided. However, a part of them decided to accept the goods, so the market is still brewing.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls Eight or Nine Jiao</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton yarn market was weak due to the fatigue of American cotton and the continued sales of Japanese merchants. The selling wind in the market was relatively strong, and the various months fell by 7, 8, and 9 jiao to 1.2 yuan. The opening of the market in the afternoon was still sluggish, but a part of the short-sellers profited and made up for it, and the various months rose by 1, 2, 3, and 4 jiao.

<h3>Estimate of Increased Cotton Production in North China Weakens Market Sentiment for Marked Cotton</h3>
<p>Cotton prices are trending downwards, and the situation is gradually loosening. The second estimate of national cotton production has been released, indicating a bumper harvest in North China and increased yields, leading to weakening market sentiment. At the same time, sales of existing cotton are becoming increasingly quiet. There is talk of the delivery of Hankou coarse cotton this month, but the actual situation remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Zheng Marked Cotton Drops Another Three Tael Cents</h3>
<p>The marked cotton market opened lower due to estimates of a bumper national cotton harvest and stagnant U.S. cotton prices, weakening market sentiment. Selling pressure was slightly higher, with prices falling three to four tael cents across various months. The afternoon market remained flat, with near-term contracts rising one and a half tael cents, while other months remained unchanged. Total trading volume for the day was 92,400 piculs.

Sales of Chinese yarn totaled 15,037 bales, a decrease of 7,346 bales compared to the previous ten days' 22,383 bales.

<h3>Shanghai Cotton Merchants Dump March U.S. Cotton</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market was small and volatile, but trading was still active. At the opening, Shanghai merchants aggressively dumped March contracts, and with continuous short selling, prices declined. Later, Liverpool and other firms bought in, and speculators also made considerable purchases, causing prices to rebound. The strong performance of the stock market and wheat market was also beneficial. Near the close, long positions took profits, and the close was quiet. Spot prices remained tight, but demand was slow. The yarn and cloth market was quiet. Spot prices rose 5 points per pound, while futures rose or fell 1 to 3 points per pound. British cotton futures were unchanged.

Original telegram on the left (dated the 15th).</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Market Sentiment Weak</h3>
<p>The flour market opened in the morning, with prices rising and then falling across various months. With quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago rose about 4.5 jiao, and Canada rose about 3 jiao. Therefore, at the opening, the near-term market rose slightly by half a cent, but prices repeatedly rose and fell, and the situation appeared weak. Because actual sales this month were stagnant, outside long positions rushed to sell. Demand for distant months was also sluggish due to lack of outside demand, and purchases by inland merchants also turned quiet, causing prices for each month to fall by about 1 cent each. When the afternoon market opened, with outside long positions still emerging, there was also hedging in the current month, and there were rumors of abandonment, causing market sentiment to become even more depressed. Distant months saw floating short selling, and factories also slightly sold, so the overall situation was uniformly soft and falling. As a result, the current month fell 2.5 cents, December fell 2.75 cents, January fell 2.25 cents, February fell 2 cents, March fell 2.5 cents, and April fell 1.75 cents.</p>
<p>When the wheat market opened in the morning, market sentiment was still stable. Afterwards, due to sluggish buying interest both inside and outside the industry, market sentiment slightly weakened, and with flour prices firming and then falling, opening prices loosened. When the afternoon market opened, there were signs of a market plunge, as the flour market repeatedly fell due to weak actual sales, causing the wheat market to also fall sharply due to strong selling pressure. Ultimately, the future situation will depend on the rise and fall of foreign exchange rates and the state of actual sales. As a result, the current month fell 8 cents from the previous day, December fell 7 cents, January fell 5 cents, February fell 7 cents, and March fell 7 cents. The spot wheat market: high-quality goods were not offered, and medium-quality goods showed slight loosening, falling 2 or 3 cents. Shandong white wheat was offered at 3 yuan 8 jiao 8 fen, red wheat at 3 yuan 8 jiao 4.5 fen, and Xuzhou wheat at 3 yuan 8 jiao 4 fen, totaling 10,000 bags, which were reportedly handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market saw bullish market sentiment, with general repurchasing and short covering. All floating profits were absorbed. Conflicting news from Argentina, and continued dryness in the Southwest region. Prices rose by one and a half cents. Corn also rose with wheat. Furthermore, the market rose due to rumors in the Balkan Peninsula and a lack of sellers, but whether the scope of buyers can expand and whether the nature can be sustained remains to be proven. At the same time, it should be noted that there is still the possibility of importing foreign coarse grains, and trading volume is not high.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Closing Prices: November 14th - November 15th - Change: December 99.625 - 101.00 - Up 1.375; May 99.125 - 100.375 - Up 1.25; July 93.75 - 95.25 - Up 1.50</p>

<h3>River Rice Gradually Shows Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Arrivals from various sources numbered over thirty, totaling 4,700-4,800 piculs. The market opened weakly, with few buyers in the market, and the situation felt desolate. Both retail and wholesale sales were flat for two days. However, because inland prices were high, sellers tried hard to maintain prices, resulting in only slight adjustments of a few cents to a jiao for each grade of japonica rice and late rice. Duyang pointed rice sales were not stagnant, falling nearly a chi, while only Yinyuan rice, relying on the activity of distilleries, showed strength again.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 25-26 arrivals from various inland routes downriver, with 140-150 boats docked. The market saw continuous demand for various types of rice, including new japonica, thin rice, new mutton rice, and Dujian pointed rice, while sales of old white yuan and yin yuan were slightly lower. Broken japonica rice, new and old Bubuke pointed rice was average. Market prices for new japonica, broken new mutton rice, Dujian pointed rice, old white yuan, yin yuan, and new and old Bubuke pointed rice were stable. However, early thin rice was flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for Foreign Rice in Inland Areas Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for foreign rice saw active sales, and in addition to Zhejiang merchants continuing to purchase, Wuxi merchants newly arrived in the market to inquire. However, sellers disliked low prices and raised them, causing prices to rise by 5 cents. Number One Saigon was offered at 2,500 bags, with prices up to 11 yuan 4 jiao. Siamese Yuan rice was offered at 3,000 bags, with prices up to 11 yuan 8 jiao 4 fen. Annam japonica rice was offered at 1,700 bags, with prices up to 11 yuan 9 jiao. New futures transactions have not yet been agreed upon, and returned goods are also being quoted higher, totaling 500 tons. Arrived Xiang rice was slightly reduced, and after inland merchants inquired about foreign rice, appetite for Xiang rice slightly weakened. As vendors felt that costs were high, they intended to raise prices, so the total market only offered 1,500-1,600 bags, it was said.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, foreign merchants dumped March small rice at a price of only 5 yuan 1 jiao, but only if 3,000 tons could be confirmed. However, buyers only had a demand for over 2,000 tons, so it was not settled. Ready-loaded Saigon rice was allowed by foreign merchants to sell at a price of 5 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen, but was also abandoned due to insufficient quota. Therefore, only returned goods were offered on the market, totaling 200 tons of Siamese rice, 100 tons of March Saigon rice, with Siamese rice priced as before and Saigon already at 5 yuan 3 jiao, which is significantly higher by 3 cents. Small return lots of February rice are at 5 yuan 5 fen, and 100 tons of March rice are at 5 yuan 1 jiao. The market is turning stable because the foreign merchants' dumping was unsuccessful. Spot foreign rice prices have turned flat because demand from inland areas is weak. Total offerings include 2,565 bags of Saigon, Annam, and Siamese rice, 2,000 bags of Xiang rice, 1,800 bags of Hankou coarse rice, and 2,000 bags of Shashi coarse rice, all distributed by inland merchants. Market prices are only slightly different from the previous offerings.</p>
<h3>Red Sorghum Continues to Be Hot, Soybeans Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>The red sorghum market remained brisk the day before yesterday, as production prices continued to rise and the source was scarce. Only five carloads arrived yesterday in two rounds, and it was only for delivering previously dumped futures. However, one carload was returned in the morning, with a price of 3 yuan 5 jiao 9 fen, which was 4 cents higher than the previous market price. In the afternoon, buyers searched urgently, and sellers continued to release half a carload at a price of 3 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, another 6 cents higher in one day. Road goods were traded at a price of 3 yuan 4 jiao 9 fen for delivery of one carload in one week, and a price of 3 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen for delivery of two carloads in two weeks. Also, one carload of Andong red shelled sorghum was delivered in two or three days, with a price of 3 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen. Due to the disaster relief tax in Anhui province, the source of train car soybeans was disrupted, and only Henan soybeans and Dalian Niuzhuang Hankou goods were transported in recent days. However, due to rising production prices, arrivals were also scarce, so the market situation gradually strengthened. Yesterday, Yingzhou old soybeans were offered at 3 yuan 3 jiao, and various new soybeans were offered at over 3 yuan. Yesterday, about twelve or thirteen carloads of new soybeans and about twenty carloads of old soybeans were traded, and prices all rose by 5 or 6 cents. Old soybeans were handled by factories, and new soybeans were distributed by local merchants and merchants from Wuxi and Changzhou.</p>
<h3>Brisk Demand for Oil Market Soybean Oil and Peanut Oil</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean oil and peanut oil market has been quite active, because soybean prices are rising, market sentiment is bullish, inventories in producing areas are not abundant, rivers and waterways are freezing soon, and local inventories in this city are also low. Demand from various regions is not weak, so market prices are gradually tightening. Yesterday, 170 pieces of various peanut oils were traded, and prices rose by 2 jiao. Soybean oil trading included 300 pieces of Dalian oil by steamer, 100 pieces of Niuzhuang oil by steamer, 300 pieces of Shahe Qishan oil by steamer, 50 pieces of Niuzhuang oil by sand boat, and 50 pieces from Dayou Factory. Newly offered prices for various soybean oils continued to rise by 1 jiao from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Green Slices Open at Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand Seen Going Downstream</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak, with little trading. The guild's set price for 24 coarse sand white spot goods was 18 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, with only 50 bags traded, down 5 fen from the previous day. Transshipment goods were quoted at 5 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, slightly down by 5 fen, and also not traded. A few dozen bags of 89 Dutch red high-quality SY brand were traded at 14 yuan 2 jiao, and transshipment goods were slightly firmer, quoted at 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen.

Over thirty large bags of new water from the Fujian guild arrived, with both honey-colored and white types. Because prices did not match, no transactions were made. Five Fortune Four Waters is expected to continue arriving today, and according to the merchants, they must increase prices to open trading.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods, Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Market Prices Soften</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber has passed its peak sales season, and demand has decreased, so the market is gradually softening. Shangzhuang goods have fallen to about 18 yuan, and ordinary goods are only 16 yuan. There are sporadic transactions among local merchants, and few large transactions with outside merchants. Offering prices for merchant goods are gradually softening, as supply currently exceeds demand (if there is a lack of large demand, it is extremely difficult to improve).</p>
<h3>Daylily Transactions Are Not Many</h3>
<p>Not many daylilies have been offered recently, and arrivals and sales are also low. Yesterday, merchant goods only offered 35 bags of ordinary Haozhou vegetables, with a price of 13 yuan 5 jiao, probably because the quality of the goods was relatively poor. Most sales are only sporadic transactions. Market prices for top-grade Zhuangcai daylilies are 19 yuan to 18 yuan 5 jiao, Daxing vegetables are 17 yuan 5 jiao, Yanghua vegetables are 16 yuan 5 jiao, Suqian vegetables are 16 yuan, Xuzhou vegetables are 16 yuan to 15 yuan 5 jiao, and ordinary goods vary around 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Superior Cavalry Twill Has Reached Eight Yuan Per Yard</h3>
<p>The cavalry twill market has been even more active recently, and the truly superior 1005 goods are in short supply, with inventories gradually depleting. Wholesale prices have therefore risen steadily, and wholesale prices for brands such as Deji, Lulin, Lihe, and Yihe have all jumped to 8 yuan net, while retail tailoring prices are 8 yuan 2 or 3 jiao. Kongshi 100 is 8 yuan 8 jiao, and box prices are quoted at 8 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, but stocks are still scarce. Most mixed-brand fake 1005 cavalry twills are only sold for a little over 6 yuan. Western clothing stores in the Daxin Street area use this to attract customers through speculation. In fact, a genuine 1005 cavalry twill overcoat requires 2.75 yards of material, costing around 40 yuan at the current lowest market price, so it is not difficult to tell whether a garment costing over 20 yuan is genuine or fake.</p>

<h3>A Little Supplement to the Form and Legacy of Art</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's dissent regarding [The Form and Legacy of Art] seems to have no different opinions from us on other points: but on the contradiction between the worldview and creative methods of classical realist writers, our opinions are obviously opposite. I feel there is a need to briefly explain this point further.</p>
<p>The contradiction between the worldview and creative methods of ancient and great writers was not actually [resolved], but rather overcome to some extent. Regarding this issue, Mr. Ye believes it is caused by social change.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, it is not wrong to say that this considerable overcoming is due to the results of the writer's creative practice. Why is this?</p>
<p>We know that art and science have their similarities and differences. Both art and science equally universalize phenomena, but science does so through abstract concepts, while art does so through concrete images. Precisely because of this, art has a closer and more direct connection to reality than other sciences; that is, art is more directly influenced by reality than other sciences. But this influence is only a possibility that exists in reality. Why were only Balzac, Tolstoy, and others among many classical writers able to accept this influence, and contrary to their worldview, create artistic works that were realistic to some extent? This is because they were influenced by realism – they adopted the methods of realism to create, deeply observe reality, and synthesize reality, which is what made them successful. And this clearly indicates that they overcame their worldview in the process of creation. I believe Mr. Ye is obliterating the practice of artists on this point.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>— Huan Ming</p>
<p>In his [Futile Scholarly Pursuit], Tsurumi Yusuke laments over Lord Acton, who engaged in history. The futile scholar read books for a lifetime along the Mediterranean coast blooming with olive blossoms: but in his career, he was far inferior to the early-deceased Richard Green, and the short-lived Rai Sanyo: he could not leave behind achievements that would inspire later youth, like these two who sojourned in the world for much shorter periods than him.</p>
<p>Therefore, he believes this is simply a tragedy.</p>
<p>Reading can indeed bring out tragedy. The same book, spread out before two people with different reading methods and perspectives, will have different influences. Their benefits and disadvantages all depend on whether the person reading the book can avoid something, or find the beneficial essence within.</p>
<p>In Bacon's [Of Study], Francis believes that reading is used for amusement, ornamentation, and increasing intelligence. Strictly speaking, the first two points should be considered more empty and passive; although their existence should also be acknowledged, they are far less important than the latter point. The purpose of reading should not be to appreciate or play with romance, and the books read should not be exclusively used for ornamentation in front of others. Reading should be about opening up a reasonable path for personal life and a reasonable path for society, following the steps of progress.</p>
<p>Is it accidental that a reader like Lord Acton cannot write and contribute to mankind like Gorky, who came from a boatman's background? If one cannot leave the book, read living books, experience, observe, and create living things, what is the use of reading even more cartloads of books?</p>
<p>A person who obtained a master's degree in philosophy because he only knew how to read philosophy and only respected the words in books, his thinking became detached from life: he took the theories deduced and generalized from life and viewed life with disdain and cold laughter. Thus, a young man in his thirties revealed a pitifully insane appearance. I listened to his words and could not find a single sharp insight. When I talked to him about real things, he only muttered some incomprehensible curses. Isn't such a person also reading out a tragedy?</p>
<p>Many readers are like duckweed. Books are like a gust of wind, and duckweed is carried wherever the wind blows; sometimes they seem to take root, but in this situation, they still continue that vague floating. This attitude does not seem to be approved by the humorous Shaw either:</p>
<p>[The most useless people in the world are readers, because readers only know the thoughts and art of others and cannot use their own.]</p>
<p>Is this just an occasional grumble from that old child, Shaw?</p>
<p>Simply compiling a circle from the books one reads behind closed doors, abandoning all reality, or not allowing any subjective intrusion except for the opinions of people one believes in - is it too simplistic to use such a circle to judge, curse, and praise the world? It is important to pay attention to those invisible books, not just reading the words printed in lead: not only that, but it is also important to explore and understand the soul and essence of all things objectively and subjectively. This is the most ideal. Being able to turn what you read into hair or skin may not be the worst thing, but isn't it more important to turn every page into [your own] blood and flesh?</p>
<p>Treating reading as seriously as marriage is probably the source of part of the tragedy. However, from the perspective of human active standpoint, are readers who bite on cigars and sit on sofas to [appreciate] not themselves also futile scholars in society? A reader who only knows how to read or only knows how to live according to the principles in books, forgets the world, or makes the world forget him - in reality, he has not benefited, not only is he useless, but he is also harmful; not only does he harm himself, but he often harms mankind.</p>
<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The last ray of sunlight in the west, unnoticed by people, disappeared into the mountain recesses, and the cool evening breeze followed closely on the ground, followed closely by the unveiling of the blurry evening curtain. The sparrows, rushing headlong to their nests, as if taking a step later, their lives would bury them in the dark abyss before them. They chirp and call, and I guessed that they were saying good night to each other, and mutually discussing the things they encountered during the day. For me, a traveler who cannot return home, it is a demonstration to me. The midges, and perhaps other bugs that cannot be described individually, although they cannot be said to like the dark, at least they rely on activity in the dark. At this time, they were pouncing and biting on my face fiercely, as if I were a rich man, and they were a group of bandits, targeting me as a piece of fat meat. No, my assumption was immediately proven wrong: it was not just me alone. The coachman, and the people sitting in the same car with me, were all suffering the same siege.</p>
<p>The sky's edge is red, and the red sunset glow is like one flower after another; the smoke rising from people's chimneys is gray, and it is light and fluttering, sometimes thick and sometimes sparse, and finally wandering into the sky; the three of us are tired. The carriage has been traveling on mountain roads all day, and the road is rugged and uneven, bumpy to a very high degree. I guarantee that if there is a woman among us, and she is pregnant, then her bulging belly will easily flatten out. The horse is also out of energy. Just looking at that lazy appearance is clear proof. Like people, horses also have to find ways to defend against mosquito attacks. The tail is a weapon for exterminating mosquitoes, constantly swinging up, down, left, and right, and hitting the body.</p>
<p>It is getting dark, but there are still five or six miles to the small town where we will stop for the night. In order to hurry on the road, the coachman is adding whips to the horse, and the hearts of us passengers are three times faster than the horse's footsteps.</p>
<p>The scenery before us is gradually blurring and cannot be distinguished, and the sky, the ridge, and the ground have been dyed with the same color of darkness.</p>
<p>[Faster].</p>
<p>The passenger surnamed Zhang urged the coachman, because he was carrying more than a hundred yuan, and he was afraid of encountering accidents on this dark road.</p>
<p>[It needs to be fast, old sir. I am even more anxious than you.]</p>
<p>After the coachman finished speaking, he added a few more whips to the horse.</p>
<p>I have not walked this road for three or four years, and the road still cannot ease a person's frightened heart. People walking on the road must always beware of an unexpected encounter. Especially at this time, it is even more chaotic than in previous years. In order to resist the [Manchukuo]'s ruling policies, some teams who do not understand the truth often appear in the countryside. There are naturally many who belong to benevolent and righteous teams, and do not rob or steal; but there are also really many who take advantage of the situation to loot.</p>
<p>During the day, I was observing the situation along the road. I wanted to find the differences between the past and the present, but my eyes did not allow me to complete this attempt. Naturally, I cannot see the old national flag, and I cannot even find one of the current [Manchukuo]'s five-colored flags. This is the countryside, and the countryside people's concept of the nation is as light as freshwater. They do not care what national flag it is. Faded and incomplete spring couplets are pasted on the doors of every household, and they are still sentences of [world peace] and [abundant harvests]. People are still doing sweaty work in the fields, and dogs, like before, know to find the shade of trees to doze off, while drool is flowing out of their mouths; children carrying water jugs to and fro on the ridges of the fields are also what I have seen before. The hills and rivers that I clearly recognize all stay in place without changing. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Nature - And a Person</h3>
<p>— By Gorky, translated by Fang Turen</p>
<p>The small hills are interestingly encircled, as if their soft contours were crafted by the hands of people concerned with the beauty of the scenery. These people arranged their small, old-fashioned town amidst the mountains and waters—a dense gathering of colorful little houses. These hills act like a romantic artist. The spire of a Gothic church protrudes from one of these peaks, like an arrow certain to hit its mark. Human dwellings, the cubic architecture of wood and stone, descend like steps along the mountainside into the valley below. In the clear, dove-colored sky, the sun leans over the town, rising diligently. Its pure white radiance has already emitted the pink hues of dawn, though its rays only stream a faint light, illuminating the cultivated cocoa-colored soil and the silken green leaves used to cover the ground in winter. A carefully flattened road leads from the town down the mountain, all the way to the valley. Two bronze-colored, large horses, led by a well-proportioned man dressed in dark blue clothing, advance along this road. A tall woman in black follows them, her back burdened by a heavy basket, her waist bent. Guarding this straight road are two rows of ancient trees, their small branches carefully pruned. They have not yet sprouted buds, and it seems they never will sprout buds, even until the end of their lives. These ancient trees will remain without leaves, their entire bodies covered with rough knots, like tumors pressing down on their branches. Beautifully harmonizing with the fields are the small, clustered villages, already adorned with light blue tender leaves. The gentle breeze of spring rustles them, creating the illusion that these trees are moving in the fields. Some of them are indeed close to the railway embankment. The wind, filled with the moist, sweet smell of earth, shakes them, as if counting their tender leaves. The sunlight plays among the branches, seemingly nesting there.</p>
<p>Here, one cannot help but feel a sense of awe for humanity, which has arranged itself so comfortably and successfully on the earth.</p>
<p>Hanging from a thick branch is a person, his feet almost touching the embankment. This is a very pitiful person! The tough rope that strangled him is twisted from two ropes of different thicknesses. The knot on his head looks like a large, gray spider. This person extends his arms parallel to the seams of his clothes, like a soldier standing at attention; his fingers are hidden in his wide, torn pants. A thick short coat, stained with lime, is open at the chest, seemingly about to slip off his drooping shoulders. His gray shirt is open at the neck, exposing his slightly less grayish-brown skin of his abdomen. His waistband has fallen, and the sun illuminates a tuft of pale red hair. The person’s head droops between his chest and right shoulder; a patch of light blue bald hair reflects the sun. His left ear carefully listens to the sky; his protruding right eye coldly stares at the dirty shoes on his right foot! The heel is lifted, and a large toe protrudes from a hole in the leather shoe, like a piece of meat extending from the mouth of a very old, moving monster.</p>
<h3>Achievement and Retirement</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Wandering Swordsman (9)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>After continuous heavy drinking, he paused temporarily. His fingers tapped the edge of the table, and his small, cunning eyes, filled with bloodshot, stared sluggishly at the small lamp flame. He had already forgotten the waiter. It was around the Mid-Autumn Festival, a time for thinking of home, wouldn’t it be?</p>
<p>Speaking of his home, it was an unsolvable mystery. The waiter, with nearly ten years of friendship, had asked him about it, but he only said that he had been away from home for thirty years. He had not returned in those thirty years, and feared he would die in a foreign land. As for who else was in his family, he only responded with a meaningful shake of his head, and then would not say much for two days afterwards. Therefore, in the last two years, the waiter never mentioned this matter. Perhaps he was a highway robber in his homeland, perhaps he was a lawless bandit, perhaps he suffered the calamity of family ruin and death, or perhaps in a fit of anger over his wife’s adultery, he killed the adulterer and adulteress, and fled to another land. His rising and falling shoulders were slightly slumped, with some remaining traces of his past demeanor; his small, round eyes still had undiminished brilliance. In his youth, he must have been a rare strongman. Although he was already in an irretrievable state of old age and decline, his back already bent.</p>
<p>The purplish flush on his face had faded, leaving only a grayish pallor. The wrinkles at the corner of his jaw were like countless small mountain ranges stretching there.</p>
<p>[Not bad, friend...] He leaned forward halfway, grasping the cup with his nail-like hand. [Dry... you know, I haven't messed around with anyone for thirty years. Today, I lost.]</p>
<p>This was unreliable, because he had a fierce drinking session with the waiter every night, even to the point of shedding tears. At such times, his words became even more difficult to understand. Perhaps understanding him, the waiter made a face and drank the cup he offered.</p>
<p>[Ah, this is conscience, conscience! Good, let's dry it.]</p>
<p>[Conscience grows on the buttocks, right?]</p>
<p>[No!]</p>
<p>He shook his hairy head, the brim of his hat rustling. Wine splashed on his chest.</p>
<p>[But, that's what you said!]</p>

<h3>Simple Method for Increasing Plate Voltage</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>If the plate voltage of the power transformer used in a transmitter or receiver is too low, the unused filament winding in the secondary coil can be connected in series with the positive coil of the input power supply. Therefore, the induced voltage of the filament coil is added to the positive coil, so that the voltage between the positive coils automatically increases; then the plate voltage coil in the secondary coil increases along with the positive coil voltage and the number of turns ratio. The amount of increased voltage can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p>Vs2=Vs1+Vf/Vp×Vs1</p>
<p>In the formula, Vp is the power input voltage, Vf is the filament coil voltage, Vs1 is the original plate voltage, and Vs2 is the sum of the original plate voltage and the increased voltage.</p>
<p>To check if the coil is connected in the wrong direction when connected in series, a high-voltage AC meter can be connected in parallel to the plate voltage terminals, and then the filament voltage coil is connected in series to the positive coil, referring to the attached diagram. If the value on the voltmeter increases compared to when it is not connected in series, then the connection direction is correct; otherwise, the two connectors must be switched.</p>
<p>In the secondary coil section, there is no limit to the number of filament voltage coils that can be connected in series with the positive coil, whether it is one, two, or more than two. However, it is necessary to ensure that the power transformer is not subjected to excessive load, which could damage the insulation in the middle.</p>
<p>In places where the city power voltage fluctuates easily, this method can be used to control the power supply voltage, eliminating the need for a separate doorbell transformer, which is much more convenient. Comrades might as well try it.</p>
<h3>Economical AC Two-Tube Machine with 6F7</h3>
<p>— Wu Yingjian</p>
<p>Since the introduction of new vacuum tubes, amateur enthusiasts have generally used multi-electrode new vacuum tubes to make various single-tube machines. This publication has also introduced many circuits. The performance is indeed not bad. Receiving various local radio stations can produce sound in the loudspeaker, which is enough for many people to enjoy. The author also used a 6F7 composite vacuum tube to make a single-tube machine, using the pentode section for detection and the triode section for low-frequency amplification. Although it could also produce sound in the loudspeaker, the volume was always too low. Later, it was changed to the circuit shown in the left figure:</p>
<p>Using the triode section for detection and the pentode section for low-frequency amplification, the volume increased considerably. Because dry cells are uneconomical and the need to replace them frequently is troublesome, and winding transformers is also very troublesome, it was designed to use direct power supply. The vacuum tube filament voltage is taken from the resistor reduction, which is much more economical.</p>
<p>The ground wire is not drawn in the circuit because it is best to avoid using a ground wire with direct power supply. If a ground wire must be used, a 1MFD fixed capacitor must be connected in the ground wire circuit, otherwise there is a risk of electric shock and damage to the vacuum tube. One stage of filtering can also be omitted in the power supply section. However, using two stages of filtering can reduce AC hum. Also, connecting a 0.5MFD fixed capacitor between the rectifier tube Vr cathode and filament can also reduce AC hum, which can be tried. The specifications of the components in the circuit are described on the right:</p>
<p>L: Wound with No. 26 wire in 55 turns on a 3-inch diameter spiderweb board.</p>
<p>L1: Wound with 30 turns in the same way as above.</p>
<p>C, Cr: .0005 variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C2: .00025MFD fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C3: .5 fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C4: 8MFD fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C2: 2MFD fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>R: 2MEG grid resistor.</p>
<p>Rr: 10000 ohm resistor.</p>
<p>R2: 300 ohm resistor.</p>
<p>T: 1:3 1/2 low frequency transformer.</p>
<p>AFC: 30 Henry 25 milliampere low frequency choke coil.</p>
<p>V: 6F7.</p>
<p>V1: 2Z3.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Filament Switches</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengshi</p>
<p>All DC radios, regardless of how many tubes they have, have a filament switch to control the filament voltage. Because every type of vacuum tube has its maximum filament voltage, there is a risk of the filament burning out if the applied voltage exceeds this value. Many readers who are new to wireless electricity have probably made this mistake, right?</p>
<p>Taking the A-109 vacuum tube as an example, its filament voltage is 1 to 1.3 volts. However, an ordinary dry cell has 1.5 volts, so another resistor must be used to lower it. The following three methods are usually used to lower it:</p>
<p>1. Add an appropriate fixed resistor in the filament circuit, and use another switch to control the opening and closing. However, the voltage of the battery gradually decreases, so this fixed resistor also needs to be replaced frequently, which is very troublesome, so it is rarely used. (Figure 1)</p>
<p>2. Use a variable resistor (rheostat) to control the adjustment. This method is certainly very good, but it also has its drawbacks, that is, there is no certain standard for how much to open. Even if there is an arrow on the knob, it is easy to make mistakes if you are not careful. Especially if there are many children in the house, if they are happy, they will run to play with it at will, which is even more likely to cause damage. (Figure 2)</p>
<p>3. Use a variable resistor and a switch together. First, open the variable resistor R to the appropriate position and fix it, and then use S exclusively to control the opening and closing. But at this time R can still be rotated, if someone turns it when not listening, and then closes the switch without inspection, the filament may burn out. (Figure 3)</p>
<p>The above three methods are not perfect and are prone to problems. Recently, I have slightly improved the second method, which can eliminate all the above drawbacks. Therefore, I wrote it out for you readers to use as a reference.</p>
<p>Most of the knobs on the market are made of bakelite, but here we need a wooden one. A diameter of about one inch is best. Drill a half-inch long copper screw into the side, as shown in Figure 4. Place this knob on the variable resistor shaft and tighten the small screw B to fix it on the shaft. Then rotate it so that the copper piece inside is exactly in the right position (that is, at this time the filament receives the specified voltage), and then drill another screw C on the panel, as shown in Figure 5, exactly next to A, blocking A. That is, A can only rotate within the very small range AD. In other words, the voltage received by the filament can never exceed a limit.</p>
<p>If the battery voltage is gradually decreasing and the filament voltage is insufficient, then you can first loosen B, lift up the copper piece inside, turn the knob counterclockwise a little, and then tighten B. Now, when you open to the point where the two screws A and C are in contact, the copper piece inside has already turned a little more distance, that is, the filament voltage has increased a little compared to just now. According to this method, you can increase the filament voltage at any time, but as long as the screw B is tightened, the filament voltage can only change within a certain limit.</p>
<p>I have installed several radios, and the filament switches are all using this method. Therefore, anyone can manage it freely and without any worries. Bakelite knobs cannot be used because they are not easy to drill holes in. However, the wooden knobs on the market are also very beautiful and can be used. If the manufacturer could pre-drill holes in the bakelite knobs and sell them, that would be even better.</p>
<h3>Coupling Circuits for High-Frequency Amplification</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>3. Mixed Resistance Coupling Method - This type can also be divided into two categories.</p>
<p>A. Tuned Plate Mixed Resistance Coupling - This coupling method has excellent efficiency. Its tuning circuit can maintain a mixed resistance of up to 100,000 ohms for the resonant frequency without changing. However, if the high-frequency tube uses a triode, the plate resistance is also connected in parallel to the tuning circuit, which easily reduces the mixed resistance and weakens the selectivity, as shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p>B. Parallel Plate Voltage Feed Coupling - This coupling method has a separate path for the plate's DC voltage. The voltage fluctuations caused by resistor R are transmitted to the detector tube grid by C, as shown in Figure 5. Its disadvantage is the same as resistance coupling, so there is no need to repeat it. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive voltage drop due to the plate current, a choke coil is usually used instead of a resistor. However, this choke coil cannot have parasitic capacitance to prevent a large reduction in efficiency, as shown in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 8 is also a type of parallel plate voltage feed coupling. The only difference is that the capacitor C used to transmit the radio waves is replaced by a coil. This coupling method is extremely uniform for any frequency, and its selectivity is extremely special, which cannot be compared to any other type mentioned above.</p>
<p>(Note) In each diagram, the one on the left is the high-frequency tube, and the one on the right is the detector tube (End)</p>
