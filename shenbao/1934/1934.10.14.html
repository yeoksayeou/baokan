<h3 id="c30">中國興業銀行停業感言　經 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>本埠中國興業銀行。近爲營業關。係驟感周轉不靈。已於前日宣告停業。其附設之中國羣益銀團。亦連帶受着同一影響。本來規模较小的銀行。因爲一時營業不振的關係。擱淺是非常容易。不過這一類銀行及其他小規模的商業機關在目前的困難。似乎已成了一種不是偶然的現象就這一點說。我們很希望銀行界及社會各方面。都能負起責任。給這個問題下一正當的解决據報載中國興業銀行係在民國十四年成立初與直系軍人有相當密切的關係。後因政變。才由所謂羣益銀團者接收。到現在所收存欵僅有數十萬元。其他所負債務。亦不甚複雜姑無論停業原因何在其影響决不至波及本埠金融界的全體。但從另一方面看。該行停業後對於社會所發生的影響却不可輕視。至少某一部分社會不能不受其打擊。</p>
<p>在目前全國經濟不景氣的空氣中。國内銀行業的獨特繁榮已有了確然不移的事實。第一個原因是在於錢莊的銀行化在金融推進的時候舊式的錢莊。不適於。生存所以錢莊亦多改成銀行式樣第二是銀行的錢莊化在目前都市資金過剩的情形下不但大銀行都推廣。分支行運動同時許多小銀行設立。亦如雨後春笋不過以最近銀行業發展的事實而論一方面銀行業因大銀行資力集中。易於發揮銀行的效能。確是一椿可喜的現象他方面則因小銀行任意設立。監督力量。幾於難以運用。這便成了國内金融業「美中不足一的一點。像那些雖向下稡注册而營業却完全處於自由狀態的小規模銀行。前途的確十分可慮。我們認爲這是銀行制度問題的重心所在現在鑒於中國興業銀行的停業經過格外感覺所見之不謬。</p>
<p>年來我國銀行業的發展。比較從前格外迅速。銀行業最重要的使命卽在於保護國内資力尤其是要能够保護中下級人民所提供的儲蓄資金因爲這是國家資力供給的主要源。泉目下全國的儲金。不及五萬萬左右爲數極微。足見社會的信用急待銀行去倡導和推進果如像目前小銀行制度變本加厲的發展下去。不但在銀行制度上是「美中不足」並且有使中下級人民的儲金。失去保障和提倡的流弊這是保等重大的問題卽就中國興業銀行的停業事件而論。本埠的金融雖並不因此而感覺如何的痛癢但一般平民對於現在金組織的信仰。却難免不發生折扣。我們該以此事爲前車之鑒盼望銀行界及社會全士加以嚴重的注意。</p>

<p>（倫敦）晨郵報著文、討論銀價抬高及於中國貨幣制度之影響、謂「本問題中有一異事、卽羅斯福總統一面以貨幣貶價、爲國内復興之重要因素、一面却又以中國幣價提高爲有利於中國、易詞言之、美總統在國内則行施嚴厲之通貨膨脹政策、同時强使中國提高貨幣價格、如此矛盾之事、誠未審華盛頓方面將如何以融會之也」云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於白銀市况、此間人士察覺中國方面不但賣風已趨緩和、最近數日且已開始購入白銀、謠傳中國政府擬採取各種措置、以保護該國商務使不受銀價繼續升漲之影響、遠東銀行界人士對於此說、並不重視、英國市塲白銀出口顯較進口數量爲低、一般人以爲此層由於投機者就地購買所致、目前就技術上立塲觀察、銀市雖漲風甚盛、但若美國竟一反預料而更變其白銀政策、則市况未始不可改弦易轍也、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>爲達到警備滿洲治安之目的計、軍警機關之聯合提携恊調、係絕對必要、故從來卽有不斷之努力、至於全滿領事館警察、大使館内設有警務部、統一各領事館之警察、其部長由憲兵司令官兼任、又滿洲國有鐵道之鐵道警察、亦係由憲兵司令官指揮、其他日滿之共同防衛、警備及維持治安之必要、亦係受憲兵司令官之指揮、故滿洲之警務關係、經由憲兵司令官之統制、互相維持提携恊調、對於維持治安已獲效果、而在彼此不可分離之關係、若諒解聯合提携關東州及附屬地與附屬地外之警務係有利、則於在滿機關警務部長之文官地位、當知所以由武官之憲兵司令官擔任之理由也（十三日電通電）</p>

<p>三、如何發展國力、「力」在何處、講到這裏大家一定急切的要問、國力到底怎樣去發展牠呢、同時「力」到底在那裏呢、講到發展國力、中國在前清维新的時候、已有人注意、已有人努力、他們的主張、是要堅甲利兵、造鎗砲兵艦、那時他們認爲中國是不得了、外國人帶了兵艦到中國來打我們、他們受了砲艦的威脅、以爲必须也用機關槍砲打過去、因此當時的救國方法、便是堅甲利兵、也就是他們認爲發展國力無上的辦法、然而結果如何呢、結果是慘敗、在第一次中日戰爭的時候、中國的海軍、比日本還要充實、而爲何仍不免失敗呢、這就證明了以前發展國力的方法、是捨本逐末「國力」不能單從表面上去發展的、這樣發展的結果、祇是外强中乾一定要從根本上去培養牠、才有實際、否則、即使有了飛機大砲、洋鎗等、我們中國的兵拿了它還是不會去運用、一般人迷信、以爲槍彈是有眼睛的、注定那人要死那人就會被打死、還有我常聽見軍人說、「我是一個武人我没有學問」、這眞是大膠不然、作一個軍人、他需要的學問極多、就以開砲而論、標凖放砲、就要有極高深的數學智識、方能百發百中、中國古代的軍事家、尙且需要各種高深的學問、像諸葛亮、他是中國有名的軍事家、他能未卜先知、他能出奇制勝、他所謂「借東風」、一般人以爲他是神秘、其實不過因爲他的學問高深、故能應用自如而已、自古且然、於今益甚、所以現在一個軍事家、更需要各種智識、萬萬不能說因爲軍人就可以不要學問、如果没有學問、那就同土匪强盜一樣、同時、如果僅僅講究堅甲利兵、而不知從根本上、從各方面、去培養「國力」、那就是捨本逐末的辦法、</p>
<p>「國力」、我們如果加以分析、是包含多方面的、政治的、經濟的、軍事的、社會的、敎育的、文化的、以及一切的東西、都是國力的成分、在不久以前、大公報上登了一篇專論、題爲國防的基本問題、是丁文江先生作的、他說中國的國防危險極了、如果一巨與外國開戰、中國到處都是漏洞、剛才主席介紹兄弟的時候、恭維兄弟如何愛國、如何熱心提倡國貨、其實是不必的、我們要知道、我們中國人眞可憐、在平時要買外國貨固然很容易、但是一旦發生戰事的時候、即使要買外國貨、都没有地方去買了、穿的、用的没有、固可以不買、然而連吃的米、都不够了、我們產業這樣的不發展、而號稱以農立國的國家、連糧食都要仰仗於别人、他把你的海口一封鎖、你馬上變成斧中之魚、無處可以得生、講到交通、眞是可憐極了、俄國到迪化、祗要一星期、而我們從綏遠到新疆去、駱駝要走三個月、汽車要走二十天、在座的諸位、請你們到那邊去、你們有勇氣去嗎、這不是說中國人没有志向、而是因爲交通不便的原故、就是到雲南貴州去、也不空易、我們要到那裏去、一定要坐外國輪船、有一次我到歐洲去、船上遇到許多中國人、我問他「你們也到外國去嗎、他說、「我到雲南去、」因爲交通不便、所以這樣繞道而行、而法國人如果要去、都是旦夕可達、由此可見我們的國防如何危險、一旦邊境告急、敵兵朝發夕至、我們却苦鞭長莫及、所以、講到中國的國防、問題不是簡單、須從多方着手、同時經濟社會各種事業、都須發展起來、國防才有實際、換言之、我們先要有國力、才有國防、然而我們的國力、到底如何去發展他呢、由誰去發展他呢、兄弟所以提倡「自力主義」、便是一個最切實際的充實國力的方法、自力主義、是國力充實的發動機、因爲要談自力主義、第一先要以身作則、我自已至少要努力、才可以講自力主義、我今天勉勵大家、我們要發展國力、就先要由各人自已做起、祇要我自已埋頭努力、努力的結果、一點一滴、一分一毫、都是國力、國力是從國民自已努力產生的、不必從别的地方去找國力、現在許多國民、自暴自棄、以爲中國人眞該死、在世界上頂没有出息的便是中國人、因此大家不肯努力、這眞是自殺主義、我們要覺悟、要糾正這種自殺主義、要相信只要自已努力、便有國力、要想發展國力、一定要提倡自力、「國力就蘊蓄在每人身上、在我的腦子裏、在我的乎裏、每個人的力、就是國力的成分、四萬萬人、分頭努力、共同努力的總和、就等於民族的力量、民族的力量有了之後、國家自會强盛是没有問題的、世界上有那一個國家、比我們中國偉人、那一個國家的人口、比我們更多、有四萬萬零一個人、國者人之積、在政治學的原理上、人民是國家的要素、所以祇要我們自已大家都努力、庆努力的結果加起來、這個力量、眞是偉大無比、可以打破全世界的紀錄、可以戰勝任何國難、可以打倒任何强敵、六家祗要遵守此原則去作、結果就可以發展國力、</p>

<p>上半時直落三佔先</p>
<p>下半時二對二平手</p>
<p>昨爲西聯會開幕後之第二次中西比賽、觀衆震於東華西捕二隊之英名、往而觀者不下六千餘人、西捕隊遠不及曩昔之驍勇厲害、動作遲鈍、聯絡亦見生硬散漫、軋許雖心雄萬夫、唯年齡邁老、力不從心、有時簡直望球興嘆、上半時竟三對零之比數、下半時最後一刻鐘内、竭　力反攻、亦不過各中二球、結果爲五對二之比、西捕慘敗、</p>
<p>戴中鋒打開紀錄門時届金鐘三報、西捕始姗姗其來、裁判員發令兩軍佈陣、東華開球不遠、即爲軋許邀住、往來十數回合、馮運佑奇兵突起、盤入敵陣、轉交家球、法拉斯淘然來搶、家球乖覺順手牽羊、暗交麟經、單骑飛來、闖至捕門咫尺之處、發脚猛射、應聲落網、</p>

<p>在萬目睽睽干人歡呼之下、東華士氣大振、鐵騎縱横、砲大如雨、軋許調師固守、作困獸之鬭、相持至五分鐘之久、賈幼良邊陲起義、殺到低綫、返身傳中、李義臣刁鑽異常、鞠躬如也、讓過來球、斜剌裏曹秋亭一枝兵從天而降、拉起一腿、平而且急、勃拉特雷措手不及、飛竄入網、清晰美觀、不可多覯、</p>
<p>戴麟經頂上再立功此後戰塲盡屬東華之天下、賈幼良舊地重游、曹秋亭迎頭　趕上幸敵守將亡命拍出、始免於難、蓓蕾傑克之徒、眼見刹那間、連失兩球、都覺眼中冒火、大舉反攻、李顧二將、穏如磐石、安若泰山、大陸之門前乃可羅雀、賈幼良三度進窺、傳入危險區哉、曹秋亭頂向右方、阿戴恭候已久、接頂入門、成三對零之數、終上半時、</p>
<p>傷大將得一反失二休戰片刻、又起烽烟、東華調防之後、聲勢仍不稍衰、開球曾無已時、馮運佑連濟軍火、李義臣拔開大步、躍出人叢、迎門咫尺、又告得乎、不轉瞬小賈低球傳中、過門竄來、李義臣朴身權欄、惜遲一步、未能得手、克萊福法拉斯殺得頭昏眼花、竟自相殘殺、引起四座笑聲、屠博士操刀太急、足經受傷、不能應戰、遂告下野、自陳家球調回原防之後、西捕乃趁火打刧、軋許遙傳華萊、侵入東華禁地、大陸悔不該輕離老巢、於是華萊始告得手、未幾、捕隊五鋒又來滋擾、李寗頂出不遠、軋許力射成二對四之比、</p>

<p>林寶華敗於卡爾生</p>
<p>苦戰五盤難解難分中定勝負</p>
<p>形勢均等寳華以體力不如敗</p>
<p>中國網球會公開單打錦標賽昨日甲乙兩組舉行複賽、甲組卡爾生對林寳華之戰、尤爲一般注意網球者所關心、因卡爾生雖兩戰皆勝邱飛海、但與林寳華則從未相遇、兩人擊法相同、勝負未可斷言、昨日結果、林寳華卒因體力之不如、劇戰五盤而敗、不勝可惜、空氣之緊張、與形勢之相等、兩人皆在可勝可敗之間也、成績如下、</p>
<p>卡爾生　三比六　七比五　六比八　六比○　十三比十一林寳華</p>
<h3 id="c208">精彩不多 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>兩人從二時半開始、五時半結束、共賽三小時之多、然其中精彩、則僅數次而已、二人俱各懷戒意、作戰上過於小心、遂不能大刀闊斧、暢所欲爲、二人皆善於網前工夫、但上網之次數甚少、反以底綫抽爲多、去長取短、精彩遂失、卡爾生平日之劈殺、絕少看見、錯誤尤多、入後發球漸佳、曾上網數次、以屢告失敗、乃不敢試、退守底綫、以求勝利、</p>
<h3 id="c209">體力不如 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>寳華之失敗、非技術之差、體力不如卡爾生、最後二盤、寳華之不支、已甚顯露、第五盤能支持至十三比十一、已非容易、昨日林之抽擊與網前半空中球皆較卡爾生爲優、發球則似不如、高球以卡身長未敢試、若干次之劈殺、及底角深抽、皆使卡爾生無所措乎、惜乎塲地爲硬地之故、雙方皆感溜滑不能收足之苦、全塲未置一視綫員、尤令人生不少次數觸綫球之是否出界疑問也、</p>
<h3 id="c210">寳華佔優 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>林寳華開球、爲卡所勝、但林連勝兩局、以二比一居先、其正手深抽、猛擊卡爾生之右角、屢試屢效、但卡亦勝二局、林再勝二局、成四比三、卡爾生發球失敗、林遂以六比三先勝第一盤、第二盤發球者皆勝、各二各三以至各五、卡發球成六比五、林失敗、卡乃以七比五回勝第二盤、第三盤卡爾生突以四對零而五比二佔先、因卡爾生之發球失敗、林得連勝三局、追成五比五、乃努力加鞭、竟以八比六反勝、大出乎意料之外、林以二對一佔優勢、</p>
<h3 id="c211">竟告失敗 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>寳華體力之漸疲已見、但在此二比一居先時、不料其卒失兩盤而敗也、第四盤卡爾生休息之後、銳氣大盛、連勝六局、以光盤得勝、第五盤之第三局、林發球接連抽球觸網三次失敗、錯誤纍纍、卡又以四比一居上、復成五比三、卡爾生發球失敗（林挽救成立五比五、於是卡爾生每佔先一局、林平等之、八八九九、隨後林之發球失敗、卡以十三比十一得勝、八比七、九比八時、林曾兩度從十五丨四十挽救得勝、最後仍歸失敗、可惜、</p>

<h3 id="c224">最難的功課 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 俊思</p>
<p>小朋友，如果有人問你；「最難的功課是什麽？」我想你定會毫不遲疑的回答道；「是算學，」的確，算學這功課，旣不能如國語一般的誦讀，又不如常識一般的容易記憶，所以常常使許多小朋友算題做不出，受到師長的責罰，而生出一種看見算學就畏怕的心理。</p>
<p>不過，算學果眞是最難的功課嗎？這恐怕是未必，如果在做算題時，抱着不屈不撓的精神，一次解不出，再做，二次解不出，仍舊做下去，只要你是個用功的孩子，無論怎樣艱難的題目，終會給你解出的，而且，憑着自已腦筋解答出來，可以格外的得益而使你感到興趣。</p>
<p>算學，可說是最重要的功課，一切科學的發明都可以說是根據算學的，所以對於國家的强弱，有着極大的關係，小朋友。瞧吧！我們的國家，是這樣的衰弱，對於這最難的功課努力地用功吧。</p>
<h3 id="c225">誰發明四種文具？ <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 苦</p>
<p>小朋友，我們日常寫字的筆，墨，紙，硯，是誰發明的？這個問題，恐怕有許多同學不明白，我現在來告訴你們吧：</p>
<p>我國的墨，是周朝邢夷發明的。那時的墨，不知是石墨，還是膠墨，現在已無從考究，不過松烟墨，到魏晋時才有的，所以邢夷發明的墨，决不是松烟墨，這是可以理想得到的。此外還有筆，墨，硯三項的發明人：一個是孔子的學生仲由，發明石硯；一個是秦始皇時的大將蒙恬，發明毛筆；一個是東漢時的太監蔡倫，發明紙的。</p>
<p>我國的文具，筆墨紙硯丨自從他們發明之後，於是寫起字來，就很便利。同時文字方面，也逐漸推廣。我們應該要感謝他們發明的功勞呵丨</p>
<h3 id="c226">荳腐靑菜 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們逢到吃飯的時候，見着抬上擺滿鷄鴨魚肉，一定喜得心花怒放，日常吃慣每頓一碗的，一定欲加上半碗和一碗，眞合上「狼吞虎嚥，努力加餐」的兩句成語了。倘使今天見桌上祇擺着靑菜荳腐兩樣東西，你們一定縐着眉頭，吃不下飯；脾氣歹的孩子，還要和父母哭吵。小朋友們呀丨你們平素是不是有這種習慣呀丨</p>
<p>荳腐靑菜，你們眞不要輕視它，功效倒反在魚肉之上。因爲魚肉祗含脂肪質，對於人們没有多大的滋補；而且有時它們身上生着寄生蟲，吃下去反生毛病。至於荳腐是用大荳做的，含有充裕的「維他命」，清潔滋補，兼而有之，已爲世界一般人士所公認。靑菜的功效更大了，它也含有「維他命」；葉子中的「葉綠素」，又能澄清血液，帮助消化，只要燒得入味，滋味也不在魚肉之下。所以我奉勸諸位小朋友，日常是應當多吃些靑菜荳腐的。</p>
<h3 id="c227">看仔細 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>小朋友，看仔細！</p>
<p>那一條路是生？</p>
<p>那一條路是死？</p>
<p>努力罷！</p>
<p>看仔細你們應走的康莊大道，</p>

<p>便不怕他們有三頭六臂！</p>

<p>— 周劼心</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們在玩這個試騐之前，先要預備好一隻飯碗，一隻茶杯，一盒自來火和一張白紙丨丨大小約三时半見方丨丨</p>
<p>先倒一杯水在碗裏，然後把紙揑作一團，把它點着放入杯裏（注意丨丨杯裏要乾的最好），看它將要燒完的時候，立刻把杯覆倒在碗内，這樣，你們可以看見碗裏的水在漸漸的少起來了！</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們想想看，這是什麽道理呢？原因是很簡單的，在把燒着的紙放入碗内時，杯内的空氣因受熱而膨脹而上升了，壓力就會减少的，那時杯内比較上可以算是眞空，等到覆在碗裏，因爲外面的空氣的壓力比杯内　力大，所以立刻把水壓入杯裏去了！</p>
<p>最後，我們得到下面的結論：凡膨脹愈大，則壓力愈减少。</p>
<h3 id="c229">蓄養鳴蟲的常識 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>到了秋天，階前花間，鳴蟲很多。像蟋蟀，絡緯，金鈴子，聒聒兒等，鳴聲都很好聽，小朋友們没有不喜歡蓄養在籠裏的。</p>
<p>燕兒到了春天來了；雁兒到了春天去了：這都呌做「候鳥。」蟲兒到了秋天，振翅而鳴：所以也呌做「候蟲。」這也是動物的特性啊。</p>
<p>蟋蟀天性勇敢，好鬥，勝的往往振翅而鳴。兒童常喜養在竹籠裏，瞧它爭鬧。我小時候，把蟋蟀飼養在瓦罐裏，罐裏把泥做了幾個窟洞，使蟋蟀居住，像上古時代的穴居生活一般。這樣的飼養法，往往蟋蟀可養到冬季。「唧鈴」「唧鈴，」欣賞它們的歌唱。</p>
<p>絡緯又名「紡織娘：」因爲它的鳴聲，像紡紗一般的緣故。它們生活在花草際，身小色綠，鳴聲很大。秋院夜坐，如飄風急雨之驟至。小朋友們只須把登火遠遠誘着，它們一定飛了過來，便容易捉住　了。只須飼以南瓜花，紅菱肉，它們便能够活着，夜裏要唱歌給你聽。</p>
<p>聒聒兒一名「呌哥哥，」是產在江北地方玉蜀黍，稷，粟等植物裏的秋蟲。捉來飼在細篾綴成的籠裏，在街市裏出賣，小朋友們很容易購得的。呌哥哥鎭日振翅而鳴，令人生厭，倒不如蟋蟀金铃子幽靜可聽呀。</p>
<p>金鈴子身小金色，是一種嬌小玲瓏的秋蟲。但它的鳴聲，却非常響喨。生在叢竹灌木裏面，咱們把竹籮放在下面，用木棒繫打叢竹灌木；金鈴子便墮在籮裏，我們可以捉着了。飼養金鈴子的籠，可用玻璃做成；或爲時辰鐘式，或爲寳塔式　八角形，長方形，　圓形，都可以自已做的。這也是兒童的手工，咱小時候很喜歡自已製作呢。金鈴子只吃些飯粒，母須多量的食品。蓄養法，寒冬還能够活着，不過鳴聲很小吧了。這時候，應該把它們蓄在煖室中，籠外裏了棉絮，它便不會凍死了。記得有一年，天時已冷，我恐怕它們凍死，把它們曝在日下。豈知時候過久，把它們個個曬死。因爲閉在籠裏，它們逃不出來，便都死了。「愛之反以害之。」小朋友！這種事情多着咧丨</p>

<p>安落傘飛機上用的安落傘，是極時髦而且可以實騐科學的小玩具。</p>
<p>小朋友在課餘之暇，不妨試做一下，如果人多，選可比賽誰高誰低，更能增加趣味。</p>
<p>先用木頭做成一條箭桿，再拿一塊較大的手帕，四角用線繫在箭桿上，不過缐要長些，而且幾條線的長度要一樣以免降落時傾斜。</p>
<p>另拿一根木條，繫上一條繩。在繩端打着一個結做抛舑器。抛射的時候，將繩結鈎在箭幹上預先廖的缺凹裏。左手握住箭柄，右手握住抛射器。右手將抛射器向天空一揮，左手立刻放掉箭柄，安落傘就（圖一）飛昇空中了。</p>
<p>輕便時計　拿一個較大的木盒子，在左右兩面各鑽一圓「匚」孔，一面畫好時刻（圖二）再拿和圓孔大小適合的木桿裝就時針，空一洋線軸，架在兩圓孔之間。在軸上放一條細蔴線。一頭繫一塊洋鐵片，另一頭繫一塊「文」木片。（洋鐵片和木片的重量要相等）另用一隻空香烟罐在下面鑽一細「匚」孔孔盛滿水把木片浮在水面（圖二）裝就，香烟罐擱在另一罐上以備盛水。卽可可應用。</p>
<p>因爲「云」筒裏的水從「一」孔中滴滴流下，木片就隨水面降低，牽動圓軸，外</p>
<p>面的針也同時旋轉了。（圖三）</p>

<p>刷是一種用猪毛和牛骨做成的東西，它是用來去掉齷齪的。假使人間没有了牠，便覺得不舒服，不清潔，不清潔，便要影響人們的健康，人民身體不健全，便會使社會，國家，甚至世界，都没有精神，没有一點生氣。所以刷子雖是一個小東西，而對於人們却有着這樣的重要。</p>
<p>刷子旣這樣有用，那末究竟没有一隻大刷子，可以去掉國家的不清潔：洗雪國家的恥辱呢？有的，洗雪國恥的大刷子，却不是用猪毛和牛骨做成的東西，是天生成的，就是我們每人都有的一雙手和一個腦</p>

<p>（一）美洲土人的孩子，他們游戲的好方法，和我們完全不同，他們常常玩射箭的把戲，而且他們射箭的本領很好，眞可以說是百發百中的，因爲他們以打獵捕魚爲生活的，因此在兒童時代，必須練習生活上所必需的技能了。</p>
<p>（二）瑞士的小孩子，在去游玩的時候，常常帶着一根棍子，背一個行囊，和穿着一雙底有尖釘的鞋子。棍子和鞋子是帮助上山，或過水用的，行囊裏裝着雨衣和襯衣以備下雨和氣候的變化，這也是適應天時地理的作用。</p>
<p>（三）菲列濱的學校，他們的房屋，大都利用棕樹，竹頭做成的，他們那裏的學生，頭髪很短，直竪起來像許多硬毛，他們又把襯衫的下半截放在褲外面，脚上拖着拖鞋，形狀很不美觀。</p>
<p>（四）荷蘭的孩子，大半穿着木頭鞋子，我們看起來、覺得又笨又重，但在荷蘭那裏因爲地低多水。只穿着這種鞋最適宜。</p>

<p>對門的黄太太，伊最近很努力的敎着三個小姑娘學歌，我的住宅和它的住宅正是望衡對字，我的長窗恰巧對着伊的六角窗洞。每日的晨間，或黄昏人靜的時分，黄太太却用一種很笨的方法敎歌，伊是置辦了一隻留聲唱機，先把唱識上的歌詞抄下，便伊們唸熟，然後呌伊們隨着留聲唱機學唱。但是一個人的資質，有聰敏和愚笨的。黄太太却不管，只知道唱不下去用皮鞭子打，一面打，一面口中還不住的；「呆貨丨笨貨」大駡大打。</p>
<p>有時我在清晨或在深夜，總被這哭聲呌聲擾醒，推開窗子瞧去，在十六支的電燈光下還能望到縷縷的紫痕。我又聽到黄太太的口吻是要伊們好丨要伊們成名丨纔打的。我費了數日光陰的探討，知道這三個姑娘都不是黄太太的親生女兒，所以難怪伊能天天用這毒辣的手段，而中國的歌女成名也眞不容易啊！</p>

<p>我們每夜看見的月亮，從陰歷初一夜到十五夜，漸漸的圓滿起來，又從十六夜到三夜，漸漸的缺小下去，終年循環不停的。然而這月亮是怎麽樣變成的呢？實在奇怪不可思議的。現在我把變成的一種學說；說給諸位聽，有一位學者說；在幾千萬年以前，從我們所住的地球一部分，分離了地球，自成了一個月球。可是這種學說，終究是不是可靠呢？也不敢肯定，不過推究幾千萬年以前的地球形體，本來不像現在的樣子，有陸地有海有動植物的，是一個混　沌巨大的瓦斯塊。因此有名的科學家如喬治達爾文與法國的安里菩安加雷等，從數理學的立塲，研究這瓦斯體時代的地球，得到所以變成月亮的一個方程式，就是說，地球在瓦斯塊時代，基𢌞旋力很速，因𢌞旋的結果，其形狀變爲橢圓形，（卵形）後來瓦斯體漸�冷却，變爲流動物的大塊，（就是地球這塊的一部分，因爲𢌞旋振動的緣故，發生了一個小塊。這小塊好像肉瘤似的，漸漸大起來，後來受了遠心力與太陽力的波動作用，突然分離了大塊，另在空中存立了，這就是月亮誔生的理由。這月亮的容積，有五千立方哩大，據天文學家的考究，說月亮與地球分離的地方就是小塊與大塊分離的痕跡，是在太平洋方面的。但是這種學說，被亞沙紐裴爾博士打倒，因爲照紐裴爾博士的意見，他說：我們簡單的計算起來，太平洋的海床容積，不及月亮體積三十分之一·就是集合了太平洋大西洋印度洋等世界三大洋，也不及月亮的體積，結局說月亮是從地球分離出來的一種學說，雖然成立，但其痕跡，必非在太平洋方面。又照天文學的計算考察，從地球到月亮的距離，平均有三十八萬四千四百基羅米突、要想到月亮裏去走一次，照現今定期航空的速率，每小時熊行百五十基羅的旅客飛機計算、要一百零七天，才可到達月球，若以滬寗鐵路的特别快車計算，也要過二百五六十天。至於月亮，究竟有多少大呢？經天文學者的詳細考察，爲地球五十分之一，直徑有三千四百七十六粁，月亮裏面，每個月中，有半個月是白晝，有半個月是黑夜，不像地球面上，有大氣圈有水分層，所以月球面上温度的變化，是很激烈的，白天受了太陽的熱，到了夜間，從太陽受到的熱，完全消滅了，就是白天有百度以上的熱度，滿月的時候，竟達到百八十度，到了夜間，忽然降至零下百數十度，黑暗的低凹地方，也要降至零下百八十度，所以不論何種生物都不能生存的。又就月的光度來說；有四十億支光，最可怕的，到處有死火山的火口，全部荒寂，有留一些東西，近年來各國的天文家探險家，常常想到月亮裏去旅行，但是因爲路途太遠，寒熱急變以及空氣關係，所以不敢去冒險，倘若將來月亮的周圍，也發生了水分層大氣圈，那就可以發生生物的，照這樣看起來，我國的傳說中，唐明皇遊月宮的一句，完全荒唐無稽畦。</p>

<p>— 幸</p>
<p>自茲九先生在本刋三十一期上發表「墮胎」一文以後，接著三十三期登載了周莎子先生響應該文的「救濟墮胎」的檢討。」可知墮胎一事，已爲一般人所注意，不復如過去之當事者一味秘密，偷摸，旁觀者一味輕蔑冷淡了。</p>
<p>茲九先生點出墮胎的動機爲（一）困於經濟，無力敎養；（二）熱心事業，藉此得節少育兒之煩，（三）身體孱弱，不堪大產；（四）失身懷孕，怕受社會之誹謗，或無人負責等。莎子先生又補充一項；「凡是精神病患者，重篤的肺結核患者等等，都應當受節制生育或墮胎的義務。」可說把「墮胎」的原因意義與價値，闡發得非詳明，這裏，只想把兩位先生筆下遺漏了的其他原因，及由「墮胎」問題而聯想到的避孕問題，約略地提出討論。</p>
<p>開始，關於墮胎，我以爲除上述各項外，還另有其存在的相當價値；那就是；（一）在生育已到適當數目時的停止生育，（二）减少初期同居時戀愛破滅的危機與牽掣。今即分陳如次；</p>
<p>（一）這是多方的與家庭經濟，家庭敎育，婦女生理，兒童幸福，種族健康有關聯的問題。通常，一個婦人受孕七八次乃至十餘次很不希奇，如果任其自然生下那末由於生育的繁密，家庭經濟將陷於非常的窘迫，母親身體爲多量的消耗，遲生的幾個孩子也必比他的姊姊哥哥們孱弱，而雙親僅有的精力，實尤不易對付這大批兒女的敎育，生活乃到睡眠衣食等日常事項。這樣，更從何談到兒童幸福，種族健康？所以，在子女已多的時候，應該人爲的停止生育，而同時亦須保持二性間之常態的性生活；想做到這兩點，除了積極的避孕外，就有賴於這消極的墮胎。</p>
<p>（二）這是目下很多發現的離婚事實下要項由於個人主義的戀愛神聖論的深入人心，結婚的根據就建立在這上面。可是昇騰得太快的戀愛，往往極易破滅，尤其是孩子出生太早，阻止母親向外工作，增加家庭負擔，釀成經濟的原因。於是，向之促成結合者丨戀愛神聖論，今又被執爲離婚的理由。然而這當兒，小小的東西，却爲雙方分手自由的障碍，有的甚至因此勉强維持着痛苦的生活。這是離婚兩性間的最大疙𤺥，同時也是孩子的莫大犧牲。所以要使初婚幾年間不即生育等過了相當時�，雙方確信戀愛能持久，家庭經濟也無困難，然後再生育他們所需要的孩子，或不幸發覺兩方都感不滿，而能乾脆離婚，無子女之牽累亦無付給贍養之爭執麻煩，除了最初就治標的實施避孕，這墮胎實爲必要的辦法。</p>
<p>然後，我將進而談談「避孕。」這在上文固已時時提到，就在莎子先生文中，也已幾次涉及，「最好於未成胎以前，用種種合理的節育方法，那是正本清源的一個辦法」尤其說得明顯而確切，不過因爲寫時自標在墮胎，未曾深深剖析。個人覺得這兩事一是事前預防，一是事後救濟比較起來，避孕的重要性實超於墮胎。</p>
<p>這有以下幾點理由；</p>
<p>第一，就手續上講，避孕只要在兩性交接以前稍稍凖備，是輕而易舉的一回事；而墮胎，即使到了中國的衛生局已容許你公然的要求，或已有了「合理的人工墮胎所或顧問處」的設立時，到底還是非常麻煩的。而况在目下，社會是還不公開地允許墮胎，誤送性命於穏婆藥物者不必說，即有幾個手術高明的醫生，不是多方做作，便是乘機敲索，這其間的討厭，也就可想見了，而况還附帶了經濟的條件？</p>
<p>第二，就是經濟條件，社會上的一切都離不了經濟的基礎要避孕，要墮胎，經濟確實是諸種原因中之最重大者。爲了不堪生活的重負而想設法停止生育，用避孕方法，所費當然有限，而就請醫生墮胎手術費就大得可以，（自然到了眞有公立機關時，或有不同）原爲了想减輕負擔、這筆臨時支出，不也够難倒窮人？像那位無錫婦人俞楊氏，旣出了七十元的墮胎費，又被捕房罰金八十元，我眞爲她呼寃。</p>
<p>第三，就婦女的健康講，需要避孕或墮胎，大多是爲了身體孱弱，不勝生育之苦，那麽前者自然是最安全最便當的方法；墮胎，即使在很小的月份，也幾乎像一回小產，多少要傷害身體；尤其是本來衰弱有病的人，要牠經受一次墮胎，其損失程度，反比自然生育爲利害。而且據一般經騐，（也許更有學理上的根據）施行人工墮胎後，反易促進受孕。</p>
<p>以上將避孕與墮胎比較論列的意思，只是要明示避孕在事實上是比墮胎爲更合理，更需要，更應切實推行。如果到「木已成舟」的時候，墮胎自然還是救濟的辦法；但我們須記住這只是事後救濟的辦理！</p>
<p>總之，就各方面講，尤其是就經濟的，婦女解放的，猶生理的見地講，墮胎已確有成立之價値，避孕尤其有推行之必要。</p>
<p>至於如何避孕，這是實際的科學問題，應該有賴於正當醫生及對此有研究者之討論與介紹。</p>

<p>— 薛績輝譯</p>
<p>By　Miss　M.E.　Walker</p>
<p>醫藥事業亦吸引了很多婦女。從前，這種事業只有男子去研究，現在呢，據各大學的敎授們所傳出的消息，有大半的醫科學生是女子。其中有一位敎授很確實地告訴我說，他的學生有三份之二是女性。這位敎授也許是一個熱心於女性的人罷。關於在俄國和女醫生及看護們的談話我有很愉快的回憶。兩種工作人員中實有不少無名英雄。有一個少女，最近方被審查認爲合格的，某天早晨她請我到她那離城二百里的小木房子去。他的工作區域直達住宅之東六十里，西四十里。她的唯一運輸工具就是一匹馬，或一部無彈簧的農車。她獨自在那里過着最單簡的生活，她所有的只是最普通的藥品。她在忙於療治疾病，接骨，脫牙和助產的當中，同時做三種重症的看護丨丨肺炎，瘧疾和腦膜火。她把這三個病人放在她小木房中的一間屋子裏，即她之所謂「我的醫院」。晚上的時間她全用來向鄉民演講衛生，救急，清潔，和防禦肺癆等問題。</p>
<p>在某大學中我遇到一隊醫科女生，其中許多是半工半讀的。她們用餘剩的時間在校中爲那些營養不足，或不健康的同學設立一間療養院。又設有一間食堂，用最低的價格供給最衛生的食品。這種工作她們維持了三年之久，雖然她們每天早上五時就要起來凖備早飯。她們覺得這只是對同志們應有的責任。</p>
<p>有一天我和某間醫院的看護談話，知道她們是和幾個我以前所知道的社會服務機關有聯絡的。她專事探訪各家庭，尤其是大城市，居民太密的地方。她報告所有的衛生缺點，傳染疾病，和不衛生的情形。她們的工作和我們那些社會服務的工作有好些相似的地方，不過她們的權限多得多了。没有任何家庭，工廠，舖店或公共塲所能够逃得了她們的監視。她們工作中最偉大的一種恐慌：就是禁娼，禁酒和掃除迷信的運動。某隊女工爲促進禁酒運動，到處組織公衆食堂，使工人們可以在她們管理之下得到很好的食物和飲料。她們說這是剷除飲酒的一種根本方法，她們將繼續努力直至飲酒的惡習完全消滅爲止。她們根據男女平等的理由，主張解除縛束女子的家事負擔；因爲這種重擔足以妨碍女子服務國家和其他的工作。</p>
<p>我上邊所說的那些看護又告訴我說，她們將做先鋒隊向鞭靼族從事反對無知收生婆的運動。在凖備期中，她們不特要學習一種外國語言，同時還要凖備各種社會問題的演講，防禦疾病的方法，甚而至於要敎人讀書寫字。許多婦女從事於這種工作；在這個弱小民族中有許多人仍然過着遊牧時代的生活，他們自然反對他人來干涉他們這種習慣已久的生活程序。他們以爲婦女解放是需要他們用各種方法來撲滅的一種大禍。然而婦女自由的微菌已經深入他們的部落中了，那些婦女很渴望地接受着，有些已　把面　取消，出來讀書了甚或到國民大會當代表了。這種婦女回來與莫斯科，列寗格勒，或嚇格等地派來做提倡工作的人員合作。她們感覺到這種落後民族的婦女要求自由解放必須有獨立生活的能力。於是她們根據適當的商業原理把家庭工業和農民乎工業加以改良。她們在某些地方恢復久已忘掉的各種工藝。</p>
<p>關於醫藥界方面我還觀察到另一種情形丨丨婦女可以做醫藥研究的工作。我發現某一間很大的微菌學院的院長蒙台梭利（Ｍｏｎｔｅｓｓｏｒｉ）Ｐ·Ｎ·Ｅ·Ｕ幾種制度，同時又不像任何一種。那些兒童當然是很快樂，充滿許多意思，常常在沙堆，通孔的紙，或黄土中表現出來。　　外間對於我國做投機事業和犯法的罪人之如何就捕正法，丨丨他們所受的刑罰通常是復重的丨丨也許覺得奇訝，其實並没有什麽秘訣。專做這種工作的爲一大隊婦女，她們在菜市或城中熱鬧的街道上和那些買東西的人混在一塊，在買什物的當中，她很注意身邊一切來往的人。她們很熟識詐騙的一切詭計，尤其是損害國家利益的詐騙行爲。因此，這些行爲是很少能逃出她們的明察以外的。她們很顯明地是欺騙者的大仇敵；她們假如發現了欺騙的行爲，必有嚴厲的處置。如果那個被騙者是勞工份子，他們會處置得更加嚴厲。如果那個佔便宜的人並非狹義的勞工份子，他們的懲罰便更嚴厲了。</p>
<h3 id="c258">談哭 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 碧梧</p>
<p>去年談的國貨，而以農立國之邦，又當豐收之年，反而大宗地輸入洋米洋麥。今年談的婦女，婦女却更見縮入家庭，流爲娼妓，屈爲婢妾。談之爲談，也可見了！然而無話可說，仍歸要談。</p>
<p>自來認爲女人「善哭」：遠之則有華周杞梁之妻，哭夫十日，城爲之崩：近之則有北平貝滿女生，「九一八」聚哭終日，不進飲食；看來這話頗有道理。可是申包胥哭秦庭，整整七日七夜；阮籍哭途窮，一生也不知多少回，這干人又是善哭的鬚眉男子了。</p>
<p>受苦受難，心有難言之痛，没有不放聲一器的。東北初亡，國人成千成萬，圍着國府痛苦，圍着中山陵墓痛哭，首都一片號陶之聲。至今三年之孝已滿，而仍有北平女生聚哭的一塲尾聲。</p>
<p>家人受了殘摧傷害，家人爲之哭；國土受了侵略兼併，國人爲之哭。獨至像陳華生之妻之流，自已賣身爲娼以維丈夫的生計，終於不能相容而被丈夫殺害；這種人不但社會無人爲之垂淚，就連他們的至親母舅，也避而不問不聞，這一角成了没有眼淚的地方。</p>
<p>受着摧殘壓迫，靜悄悄地由痛苦以至死亡，得不到人們的一點眼淚，這種人充滿了社會之中，單看婦女方面，娼妓的惡病糾纒，婢女的發育不健，妻妾的含辛茹苦，這些，一般人已經視爲當然，當然的事毌須憐惜。</p>
<p>這「當然」的看法何從而來？不待說是政治，法律，禮敎，習慣，一切尊男卑女的思想的結晶。社會人心，就給這數千年來的思想攪得像漿糊一樣迷糊，成千成萬的人墮落其中，旣不起波瀾，也不起反應。爲被壓迫的，尤其是被壓迫的婦女計，這才是最該痛哭的地方。</p>
<p>哭一人的遭遇，哭一家的摧殘，在社會還不及螻蟻的足音。必得聯絡千千萬萬背人垂淚的人們，然後才可望成一聲吼呌。呌破這社會死氣迷糊的舊思想，舊道德，舊制度，一切破舊不整，不能應付今日帝國主義嚴重壓迫的東西。</p>
<p>一旦關入家庭，便不知哭社會之大，而但哭一已之微。這將繼續她的遠曾祖母，以至她的遠曾女孫，啼哭無窮。所謂女人「善哭」，實際成了不善器之尤。</p>

<p>中國從一九零七年（光緒三十三年）開辦女學，一直到而今，可以說一費的是「賢母良妻主義」的敎育，就是現在各大學的女生，不是還都在學「家事」課程嗎！然而說到效果是極其可憐的；請問誰看見了幾個典型的賢母良妻？又有什麽人能够站起來說一句：我對於賢母良妻這句稱謂是問心無愧的？無疑地是整個地失敗了，這不是偶然的：第一，受敎育的人，至少是中產的女子，與一般丨大多數工農貧民無關，其次，這些受敎育的女子，嫁到中上人家，終日呼奴喚婢，有孩子也交給奶媽子，其惟一任務，只在供玩弄！而她們自已，懷於「色衰愛弛」的事實，也就自然地將全副精神用來打扮丨裝飾自已！不用說，這一批人已形成了玩偶的人生觀，根本不是什麽賢母良妻了，至於嫁到中產人家，家庭生活習慣，完全與學校相反，開門七件事，家事課本已不够對付，而生產育兒，更不能乞靈講義！於是敬謹接受傳統的家風址習，或者好吃懶動，事事不管，於是乎一切「仍舊貫」！於是乎不斷的聽到「解放後的流毒」，一類批評，實在地說：過去的女子敎育，辦的人只當作點綴品，學的人只爲的攆時髦；敎者與受敎者都無視了「作人」這一原則的：（間有成功或覺醒的婦女，也不是學校敎育的力量）。可見過去的女子敎育並不以男女平等爲原則的「人」的敎育！而且，公家之設立女校，只着眼在中產以上之家，去受敎育的人，也都是有錢有閑的女子，至於工農貧苦大衆，衣食就被剝奪了，還談什麽婦女敎育！</p>
<p>「不顧孩兒們一切，聽其自然」，誰都没有這樣主張過，不過像「窮人的孩子蓬頭垢面的在街上轉，闊人的孩子妖形妖勢嬌聲嬌氣的在家裏轉，轉得大了，都昏天黑地的在社會上轉，同他們父親一樣，或者還不如」，這種現象，豈是賢母良妻主義所能解决了的？丨丨然而這還是一九一八年的現象，（見「熱風」），到現在還是牠，或者還不如呢，丨</p>
<p>知道寳愛孩子，或者居心要依着兒童本位理論去敎養孩子的人，也不是没有，可是在家庭裏，大家庭，不用說是怎麽也做不到的，就是小家庭，也仍然是空想，記得「報福的家庭」丨丨見「彷徨」丨丨裏正是述着具有理想的一對新人、可是生活的鞭子、使女主人心頭消失了勇氣，臉上消失了笑容，剩下煩躁的脾氣，兩隻陰凄凄的眼睛」丨丨動不動就打哭了孩子！而男主人也就爲此工作不成，常起來逗引孩子丨丨譬如做了、貓洗臉」之類，「：：恐怕將來也就是五五二十五，九九八十一！：：而且兩隻眼睛陰凄凄的：：」他這種哀愁的情緒，多呌人爲之悵惘呵！又如「背影」裏的一篇「兒女」，那是朱自清寫他自已對於兒女們的情形的，他並不是不懂敎養孩子的哲理倫理等等，他也不是不知道，孩子們的可愛處，只爲了孩子們會爭吵亂閙，弄得他「我若坐在家裏看書或寫什麽東西，管保一點鐘裏要分幾回心，或站起來一兩次的，若是雨天或禮拜日，孩子們在家的多，那末，擬開書竟看不下一行，提起筆也寫不出一個字：：：」他於是「仍舊按照古老的傳統，在野蠻地對付着，和普通的父親一樣」：：：「體罰和叱責」！他甚至在給聖陶信裏這麽氣慣的說：「孩子的磨折，實在無法奈何；有時竟覺着還是自殺的好」，丨丨雖則他後來曾爲這些流過眼涙，哭過一塲。</p>
<p>上邊這些是從書裏看到的，再說個時事吧；國立某大學的現任敎育系主任某君，自已是個兒童心理學專家，夫人是個女子高等師範畢業的專門人材，帶了幾個親生的孩子，住在敎授環境的新村裏，這樣家庭這樣父母，這樣環境，該是理想的了！然而孩子們的遭遇，與一般的毫未例外；打和駡，並不能倖免丨原因也無非是孩子們好吵鬧，不安，妨碍作事等等。</p>
<p>就上面所舉的例子看來，可知家庭並不是孩子們的樂園，並不足以負擔良好的撫育和敎養的任務，中產和中產以上的知識分子的新式家庭眞相如此，一般工農貧苦大衆大家，更是我們到處可以睜眼看到的！可見「負着敎育新的兒童責任」，就是知識分子的新式家庭，也是不配的。</p>
<p>一般人的成見，總以爲嫡親父母對於孩子定比别人疼得厲害，交把别人就不能放心。而母性發達的人，尤其捨不得孩子離開自已，實際，感情和理智我們人人都有的，「幼吾幼以及人之幼」，「胞與爲懷」，人類更不是從現在才有這種思想丨到現在是格外發達的！還有，愛；和怎樣去愛？是兩件事！敎養；和怎樣敎養得好？也是兩件事！對於孩子們，怎樣才算能愛得合理丨不致陷於溺愛，愛之適以害之丨去敎養，怎樣才能敎養的得法丨丨使之忻忻向榮，身體和精神都能健康！總該顧到的。其外，更重要的一點，是；以前，一般人以孩子爲自已的所有物丨財產，多是有養無敎。就是敎，也不過以光前裕後，榮宗耀祖爲極則！使之成爲「國士」的，這樣父母就很少了。現在呢；我們不論以孩子們是國家的一員，或人類的一個細胞，但至少總不應再使之「以家爲天下丨爲宇宙」了吧！敢問像這種敎養，再理想的家庭，能勝任麽？到現在，還不該將撫育敎養孩子們的責任，從家庭移到社會嗎？我們有感情也有理智，應該使孩子們成爲適應或創造新社會的一員丨再不要使之一貫的屬於家庭的膿包呀！</p>

<p>— 彭毓炯</p>
<p>（汕頭通訊）</p>
<p>一週前就來到汕頭了，想爲着在這兒，對於婦女的一般生活狀况，有個較詳細和普遍似視察，所以一直到現在才能提筆。</p>
<p>這裏的婦女，首先我們就要這樣承認，她們是健康的。那一種十足的「病態美」和「東方美」的各稱，在她們身上是用不着的。</p>
<p>（一）學校的婦女丨丨在學校裏大多數的女學生，她們却是很健康的，很樸實的，不過在這濃烈的封建思想籠罩着的中國社會，到底我們就没有看見過在一個機關，或者是一個學校裏面，有着男女地位平均的發展的所在、汕頭也不能例外。</p>
<p>隨着全世界經濟恐慌浪潮的捲打，汕頭市面似不景氣，當然很明顯的探在我們的眼前了，受着重重壓迫的汕地婦女，在這不景氣的浪潮中，多數已被驅使回到了家庭去，再没有機會享受到學校敎育的洗禮！因而，在這裏的學校，婦女所佔的單位，着實很少哩！</p>
<p>（二）家庭的婦女丨丨幾千年來没有把婦女同人一樣看待的習尙，在這兒還是深深保留着的！家庭的婦女，除了一部份少數有間階級者，能够整日裏在家裏空着手過着少奶奶或者小姐式的生活外，其餘都是要很勞苦的民家裏面橾作很繁重的家務呢！</p>
<p>在這裏還有特别令人注意的是，在一部份比較豐富一點的家庭裏面，往往要派置着幾個十歲以下的窮人的女孩來作「丫頭」，她們每日不息的工作着，直到將近十六七歲、成人的時候，在這家裏的男主人，無管是白髪蒼蒼，或者是九十以上的老翁，就要將這些十幾歲的丫頭，拿來滿足他們的「性　」，名義上是所調派爲「妾」！實際上，她們還是處在「丫頭」的地位，在家裏，也没有一點權利可以享受的，因爲下面還有幾層泰山丨丨所謂大太太，姨太太呢！這種現象，我所注意到的地方，尤以廣東一帶爲甚，因此，一般人對於「丫頭」作妾這回事，在廣東一帶，人們也很看爲尋常的事，更因此、我們當可看見，在這所謂婦女解放的浪潮，高唱入雲霄的南國婦女，是處在這樣一個可憐的地位喲？</p>
<p>（三）鄉村的婦女丨丨在這農村極度破產的狀態下的南國婦女，更是無可奈何的大多數都跑向都市裏來找生活之路，有的，雖無法跑向城市裏來，然而她們在鄉下，也是要過着很苦的生活，當我們從上海南來的時候，輪船將靠近碼頭時，我辯不出是男還是女的，頭戴上草帽，灣着腰，赤着脚，身挑着很重的擔子在路上跑着，最後有朋友告訴我，這些就是鄉間的貧窮婦女，擔着糧食或者小菜到城裏去賣呢！還有許多街上擺着的水菓店，都是一些婦女在經營，總之，汕頭的大部份的婦女，是生產的，健康的，純樸的，同是亦是很困苦，很難地在雙重壓迫下生活着。</p>
<h3 id="c261">上海濟良所訪問記 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>是個秋風打着　啃的下午。我兀自踏進了牛莊路的上海濟良所。</p>
<p>週遭盡是充滿着濃厚的基督敎的空氣。壁上掛的，是聖經中的挿圖。門上貼的，是耶穌的誡諭。從隔壁傳來的，又是該所附屬義務小學的小孩們所唱的讚美詩歌。</p>
<p>在等待被接見的時候裏，我是幾乎被迫得窒息去。十分鐘過去了，在通裏面的門口，才出現了一個怪慈和相的年老信徒丨丨孔女士。</p>
<p>據她自已介紹，知道她是專負管理責任的，於是，彼此就謙虚地打開了話匣。</p>
<p>「先請告訴我，貴所大概的情形吧。」我首先這麽說。</p>
<p>孔女士思索了一下後，就這樣回答：「本所經常費，每月是四千，來源大部由董事會負責向敎會籌集，巡捕房和公安局，雖按月有津貼，但爲數不多。</p>
<p>所的組織，現在共分三部。（一）成人：就是婦女之部。（二）兒童：是指未成年的。（三）醫院：這是專爲醫治所内婦女或兒童毛病的，不過，有時，外來的也有，總之，那全是慈善性質的。</p>
<p>她們的日常生活，婦女部是這樣的：早七時進早餐。八時至十二時，上課。退課後，即進午餐。下午一時至二時，睡眠。二時至四時，學手工，像繡花縫紉等。四時後，散步。六時晚餐。七時到八時，唸夜書。九時，一律就寢。至於兒童之部呢，那末完全和普通小學一樣，全日上課。</p>
<p>全所人數，目前約有六百左右，這中間，成年婦女，大概佔三分之二。</p>
<p>「她們進所原因，大都是什麽？有自動來要求入所的嗎？「我等她說完上面一段話後，接着這樣問。</p>
<p>進所原因，大概都是被「販賣，」或被「虐待」的，經法院判决後，就全都送上這裏來，因此所中從前做妓女的眞不少。自動來要求入所的，當然也有，但我們很少接受，實在，偌大一個上海，如果要個個救濟，那是收不勝收的。」</p>
<p>「唸的書本，是些什麽樣的書呢？」</p>
<p>「唸的書，大都是些勸人爲善的書，聖經是其中的主要功課。理由很簡單，我們的飯，是上帝賜給我們吃　、自然我們應當絕對信服上帝，你說，是吧。」孔女士說到這裏，顯出了異常的興奮。同時有手指了指天，彷彿告訴人。上帝就住在那裏樣的。</p>
<p>「婦女部的敎育　　和小學相等吧。」</p>
<p>「所裏是只止於小學程度，但女孩中，要是有可造就的人，那末所裏可轉請敎會，供給她讀中學，甚至讀大學。不過這權利婦女是不能享受的，婦女進所，照章只能住一年，一年後就擇配。」</p>
<p>「擇配的辦法怎樣？出所後可有聯絡？」</p>
<p>「擇配的辦法，這裏没一定規定，平常都由出所了的婦女介紹，經所裏派人調查認可，就得了。已經出所了的婦女，這裏她們認作娘家的，因此時常往來，今天樓上也正有兩人來探望我呢。」一個笑容，浮上？孔女士的臉。</p>
<p>「平時管理法是怎樣的？」</p>
<p>「呵！那是絕　對嚴格的，她們不能接見任何外客。」</p>
<p>談話談到這裏時，小學部已在打散學鈴了，同時，問題也覺可告一段落，遂起畔而出。</p>
<p>歸来，我心頭，總似乎有塊尖角石壓着樣的爲這些被擯在生活圈以外的婦女感到不安。</p>
<p>雖然，因爲種種關係，我没有跑進這輩婦女的作息塲所去實地觀察，但在這樣的薰陶之下，大體情形，從上面一設談話中也可推知一般了。</p>
<p>我們自已爲什麽不能有濟良所的設備呢？</p>
<p>這嚴重的間題，我很希望我們婦女界，能予以　切的注意。</p>

<h3 id="c262">現實與現象 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 愚夫</p>
<p>現實與現象，乃是兩個不同的範疇；所謂現實，卽客觀地實地在存在着的事物本體；現象呢？則是由這本體發生出來的。我們常說「社會現象」，並不是社會的現實，而是由這現實所引導出來的。每一現象，都必然有一定的現實基礎，反之，每一現實，都必然要發生一定的現象：現實是母親，現象是兒子。</p>
<p>黑格爾說；「：：：然而人，單只認識現象，單只認識感覺的現象是不滿足的。丨丨他要知道隠在這現象的背地裏的東西，他要知道那東西是什麽樣子，要研究牠。因此，我們就努力着要用思维來知道那作爲自身的和現象不同的某物，卽原因：努力要知道和單單的外在的東西不同的本質。」</p>
<p>把現象和本質看做不同的兩個範疇，這是黑格爾的是處；但他之以爲本質好像是被包在現象内的靈魂似的東西，却是把問題弄顚倒了。我們知道，在物理學上，有本體與現象的兩個範疇，但本體是客觀存在着的，現象則是由本體所發生。没有太陽地球和月球的本體，便不會有日蝕月蝕的現象。若把問題移到社會科學上來，也是一樣。很顯然的，一定要有封建社會或本資本主義社會的現實，然後才會有封建社會或資本主義社會的現象，不是這社會的現象規定其現實，而是這社會的現實產生其現象。丨丨問題是須把黑格爾的意見顚倒過來，才是合乎科學的解釋的。</p>
<p>然而，現實與現象並不是絕對不同的。在一定的現實下，必然會要發生一定的現象，它們是一致的。烏里雅諾夫說：「現象與事物本質之間决不存有根本上的區别，並且不能有那樣的（根本上的）區别：若果有區别也只是存在於已知的東西和未知的東西之間。」這是確之見。在我們未知電光與雷聲爲陰陽電相接觸所發生出來的現象之前，當然不會知道電光雷聲與陰陽電的關係：這便　是本質與現象的區别是存在於已知和示知東西之間的實例。</p>
<p>同樣，在社會科學上，一定的社會現象必然是適應一定的現實的，牠們之間並没有根本的區别存在着。譬如，在上海所發生的綁票，殺人，自殺，賣淫，强姦：：：：：等社會現象，必然是與現實的上海社會之本體一致的；又如，目前的普遍全世界的經濟恐慌，失業危機的社會現象，也是適應於目前資本主義社會的現實的：這些都是非常顯然的例證。</p>
<p>所以，我們說，現實與現象又是有區别的，又是没有區别的：有區别者，是在於現象是現實的產物，現實是母親，現象是兒子；没有根本的區别者，是在於一定的現象必然產生於一定的現實，現象與現實一致，無根本上的差異。</p>
<p>至於我們之認識現實，把握現實，則便非透過現象不可。因爲現實是基礎，現象是其產物，一定要由於現實所發生的現象對我們的感官的剌激，我們才能透過現象，認識現實。譬如，我們之認識走到最第階段的資本主義社會的現實，便是從這社會的商品過剩，市塲缺乏，經濟恐慌，失業危機：：：：：等社會現象去認識的；一定要透過這些社會現象，才能認識其現實，否則便無從認識起。</p>
<p>社會現象是很複雜的，而且往往是很矛盾的。很顯然的，在目前的世界中，一方面有基督敎的平等博愛的宣傳，另一方面却又有人壓迫人的社會現象；：：：：這些都是很矛盾的。所以，我們要認識現實，不能單從一方面去觀察，而必須透過此矛盾現象，才能認識現實的眞面目。因爲這些現象雖然是矛盾的，但這些矛盾的現象都是現實的產物，都是與現實一致的。</p>
<p>同時，社會是整個的，由其現實所發生的現象雖是複雜矛盾，但各個現象都是互相關聯着的。所以，我們不能將這些現象單獨化，作孤立的觀察，而必須將其綜合起來，作全般的考究。要這樣，才能透過現象，認識現實。反之，便會發生錯誤。譬如，在目前，在整個世界經濟恐慌中，某一部分工業，如軍事工業，有着「繁榮」的現象；假如我們只是將此現象單獨地來觀察，因而贊揚這、繁榮」的意義，那便錯了，那便不能算是認識產生這現象的現實。</p>
<p>此外，一切都是變動的，現實與現象亦然，所以我們更當在變動中去把握現象，認識現實。</p>

<h3 id="c263">塾師 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 樹邨</p>
<p>塾師，在這「普及敎育」尙只見之於紙面的今日，在内地各省仍保留了牠重要的地位。新敎育尙未得到普遍的信仰，不但内地村野鄉鎭不乏設塾課讀的事，就是當今的達官貴人，爲了增進子弟的舊學起見，也每有延師掌敎的。在敎育比較發達的江浙兩省，初級小學林立，塾師很有不少改業作小學敎員的，但私塾却並未完全絕跡。卽如在這得風氣之先的繁華的上海，私塾在貧民區中仍然有牠的存在。筆者好研究社會現象，前曾訪問過在滬西草栅内爲栅户子女敎書的先生，也曾和浦東貧民延聘的敎書先生談過話，還在江灣鄉下參觀過一個私塾。上海私塾之多且如此，内地是更不用說的了。</p>
<p>其實，私塾的發達，也不光是因爲有需要的緣故，每有因要解决一個塾師的職業問題而才組成一個「學館」的。塾師是一種舊社會殘留下的知識分子，這種人新的學問不懂，若不仗着還通曉一點經史詩詞，被人延請設館，本來是要在這新環境裏被淘汰的。這種人也許從前曾有過煊赫的光榮的過去，但隨着時代的進展，他們不得不步入没落途中，而須面對着當前的生活問題了。他們中有本領的也許活動到了官；其次的也可以爲要人們起起電報稿，辦辦文墨事情；下焉者就只好以當一個塾師爲滿足了。</p>
<p>雖同是這樣一個塾師，但在敎學勞苦和待遇上却又是完全不同的。其中，比較舒服而又得到較高報酬的，要算是在有些大小要人家庭裏課讀了。要人們把你當作一個「先生」看待着，是客氣而又周到的。他們慕你的大名請你來，對你有信仰，决不會使你的年薪低過三百元到五百元。在從前時代，有些大權在握的官員們肯每年花一千八百的請一位「先生」，是毫不足奇的事。現在，卽使是一個縣長或行政專員之類，也不缺少</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>每年拿出四百元左右的薪水來延聘一個學有根底的「士人」的。除了正薪之外，當「先生」的還可以得到種種好處。假使你的東家在社會上是一個「紅人」，或在政治上頗有勢力，則不難因你活動請求的結果，而替你弄到「一官半職」。這可以用「兼差」或「領乾薪」的辦法，再不然就是他們的少爺小姐都升學去了，把這職位讓你「實授」。久而久之，你便很可能也變成赫然的一位官員。但這種事到底是最幸運而不多見的。一般的塾師却也未見都有這種好處。有些拘謹的「老夫子」們，其至因東家的過分客氣而感到拘束；若學生們再淘氣的話，則他們甚至會藉故「辭館」的。東家常要拿精美的食品欵待他們，而他們也許寗願享用「粗茶淡飯」；東家也許要供給他們一些日用必需品如手巾鞋襪之類，而他們則寗願「自備」。這樣的人也是不少的。</p>
<p>這種塾師多半在舊學上頗有根底，不但精通經史子集　詞歌賦，還會作壽啟，訃聞，輓聯，對聯等應酬文章。有的還擅長公文，和聲調鏗鏘的四六體文辭。他們的被人聘請，也有是由自已的作品被人讚賞而來的。例如現在頗不乏這樣的事；一位官員在某處看見了一封寫得頗好的壽啟（或哀啟，或祭文：：：），他中了意就要託人請那位作者爲自已的少爺補習「國學」了。這是偶然的，普通當然是熟人或友人介紹的多。</p>
<p>私塾中本來是有「經館」和「蒙館」的不同。上面所說的有些要人們所請的先生，多半是偏於「經館」的講經方面，所授的仍不過是「古文」或四書五經左傳之類，當然也有講授「國文」的。此外還有一種敎「經館」的老夫子，他們對於「新學」常是痛心疾首，家長們也許和他抱有同樣的觀念，也許認爲舊學在將來的社會上必不可無，卽使是自已的子弟已進入初高中，而仍要利用時機把他們塞進這種「經館」學塾裏，去學一點古文及作法。這種打算全爲的將來好「作官」，下焉者也可以在鄉鎭間當當紳士，辦辦刀筆。所以現在内地頗有不少「冬烘」先生，從四面八方招來許多門徒，雖不能像孔老夫子一般有「弟子三千」，但一二十個或二三十個高足是不愁没有的。在内地這種學館也不愁没有地方開設，各處有的是宗祠，祖堂，和公共廟宇或其他公共宅第。「世代書香」的名門裏也可以安挿這一類的老夫子和「大學生」，所以這種老夫子不愁没有學館。</p>
<p>這樣一位「老夫子」每年的出息也是很不錯的。這樣一個「大學生」，按其程度和家境的不同，每年每人在「學俸」上要報效「先生」從十五元到四五十元之數。假設一位「先生」能敎得十多位學生，三四百元是不難到手的。内地生活程度較低，這個數目在他們許是可觀的了。若他們在社會上再問問事，作作土律師等，則他們甚至慢慢可以「發財」的（但有些固執的有道德的老夫子却看不起這種人）。</p>
<p>最後，我想把塾師中最苦的一種人丨敎「蒙館學」的人的生活說一說。我首先要說到的是他們待遇的菲薄。他們有舌敝唇焦敎一整年而所得仍不過二三十元的，多亦不過七八十元，很難有超過百元的。農人們僅肯每年出三四元或五六元的學費，而先生所敎的學生多亦不過一二十小孩，少僅七八個小孩，是不會有更多的收入的。上海江北帮，兩湖帮，安徽帮，山東帮：：的工人有由各本地延請先生到上海來的，這種先生每年所得也難有超過百元的，所以敎蒙館的先生是普遍的清苦。可是他們的工作却是十分繁重’許多不識一個大字的頑童要他來管，要「把筆」敎他們寫字，有許多「蠢如鹿豕」的孩子要敎他們十遍，百遍：：到頭來還是徒勞無功。你若不是一位富有忍耐性的先生，包管你每天要發一百回脾氣，而把那些學生打得哭哭啼啼：：你常要大聲的嚷，拍動「戒尺」，裝出一副可怕的面孔，使一些十分淘氣的赤脚的小孩怕你：：：這種生活上的苦痛，眞可說是「一言難盡」的了。</p>

<p>第五十九校第六組的一個孩子，名呌斯拉沃，羅尾科夫。他在家裏有一張正確的時間表掛在他的床側。上面是這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「我的生活時間表」</p>
<p>一，七時起身，作一次良好的盥洗（切勿忘記刷牙）。</p>
<p>二，　一定要做學校的功課。</p>
<p>三，用我所能够做的各種方法來鍜鍊我的筋絡（擦度鞋例外）。</p>
<p>四，這個暑期内要做好一架飛機模型。</p>
<p>五，和我父親作社會主義竸賽。</p>
<p>六，到電影院去十天内不得過二次以上。</p>
<p>七，要做一個眞實的少年先鋒隊隊員。」</p>
<p>那最後一條已經改爲；「要做一個眞實的社會主義建設者」。</p>
<p>斯拉沃所寫的這七條規則，在六十萬以上的滿十二歲的蘇聯共和國的公民，都能將他們的名簽在這上面的。的確，他們中間有的不做那飛機的模型，而去做一架無綫電機或電汽機，有的或許不能禁止自已每天要到電影院去一次，可是這個時間表的第七條却是一樣的在保持着。</p>
<p>第六組裏還有一個黑頭髪高個兒的孩子，名呌科耶、吉格斯。他的手脚生得很長，在那短衫袖的外面露出來，顯着那麽健壯而有力的樣子；他那對靴，正像一枝小樹苗，在一所破舊的草房子的屋顶上鑽了出來。</p>
<p>吉格斯十四歲了，他比十月革命還小了一歲；他所能知道的沙皇時代的事祇是一些從傳聞和所讀的書本上得來的。在那些書本上，常常會有許多生字和他爲難，這許多字眼都是他和他的同伴們所看不懂的。吉格斯處理那些生字眼的方法就是在它底下作一記號，往後再去在字典上滿足他的求知慾。這些字眼在他看不懂並不算希奇，因爲在現在不僅不常用，而且已經絕跡了；所以有些「成功者」，「敎主」，「運氣」，「皇帝陛下」一類的字眼，在他們聽來都是奇怪而且陌生的。</p>
<p>有一次，吉格斯看到Ｂａｔｍａｎ（武官的侍從）這一字眼說；「這是個什麽東西？」他並且思索一會之後給了這樣的一種結論說；「或許是一個打棒球的人吧？」</p>
<p>吉格斯的父母都是工人。他和斯拉沃兩個人進了同一個學校，都是屬於第六組的。到了早晨丨一個空氣中帶有寒意的美麗的秋天早上，第六組的第一節功課就是體操。</p>
<p>「你們預備了麽？」一丨二丨三丨」體操敎師喊着。</p>
<p>輕快的，活躍的，他們的兩條腿在那平行的鐵棍上彈動着。他們的胸圍是挺闊了，筋肉是膨脹了；那所大的健身房中是充滿着光綫和空氣。當斯拉沃抓上那鞦韆架的當兒，他開始向旁邊的同伴耳語說；「喂！今天我和我父親簽訂了一張合同呢！</p>
<p>「你瞎說」</p>
<p>「眞的，休息時候我給你看好了。」</p>
<p>到休息室的時候，斯拉沃在他的書包中找出一</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Legislative Yuan Passes the Entire Constitution Draft <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Meeting Held on the 16th Morning for the Third Reading</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to deliberate on the Constitution Draft on the morning of the 13th, with Sun Ke presiding. They discussed Chapter VII, "Municipalities"; Chapter VIII, "National Economy"; Chapter IX, "Education"; and Chapter X, "Finance." Article 125 was passed as originally proposed. For Article 126, "Municipalities shall establish municipal councils, whose members shall be elected by municipal assemblies, with one-third of the members being re-elected each year," Huang Youchang proposed changing the term of municipal council members to two years, with the possibility of re-election. Liu Guantun and Zhu Hezhong stated that municipalities are different from counties, with larger populations and the need for long-term construction. Frequent changes in personnel would hinder progress. The chairman stated that there were two points to consider regarding the terms of mayors and municipal council members: (1) the terms of mayors and council members should be the same, as differences in party affiliation could affect construction if, for example, council members had a two-year term and the mayor a three-year term; (2) mayors should have long terms because municipal construction often involves specialized technology. After Sun's remarks, the article was passed as originally proposed. Article 127 was passed as originally proposed. For Article 128, "Mayors shall manage municipal autonomy and be subject to the direction of supervisory organs in executing central administrative affairs," Chen Changheng stated that mayors should also be responsible for matters entrusted by the provincial government. As a result, "administrative affairs" was changed to "or matters entrusted by the provincial government." Article 129 was passed as originally proposed. In Chapter VIII, "National Economy," Article 130 was passed as originally proposed. Articles 131 to 142 were all passed as originally proposed. In Chapter IX, "Education," Zhang Guoyuan proposed adding an article on "studying the classics," but it was not passed. Articles 143, 144, and 145 were all passed as originally proposed. Article 146, "Everyone shall receive basic education, the details of which shall be determined by law," Wang Xiaoying proposed that "school-age children should receive compulsory education" and that the phrase "to be determined by law" be deleted. Zhao Naichuan opposed this, and the article was passed as originally proposed. Articles 147 to 155 were then passed as originally proposed. In Chapter X, "Finance," the content of Articles 156 to 161 remained unchanged, with slight textual revisions. The second reading was passed. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to deliberate on the Constitution Draft on the afternoon of the 13th. Chapter XI, "Military Affairs," Articles 162 to 164, were passed as proposed. Article 165, "The President commands the army, navy, and air force, and the power to issue orders shall be exercised by the competent ministry during peacetime. In times of war for external defense, the President shall appoint a commander-in-chief with the consent of the National Assembly or the National Assembly Committee, but the commander-in-chief shall be dismissed immediately upon the end of the war." The review opinion for this article was that the National Assembly Committee no longer exists in the Constitution and should be changed to "Legislative Yuan." The assembly passed this change. Articles 166 to 169 were passed as originally proposed. For Article 170, "Provincial districts and county and municipal governments shall not organize armies, establish military academies, or establish arms manufacturing plants. Matters related to provincial district and county and municipal security shall be determined by law," Sun Weilian proposed changing "military academies" to "military education institutions," which was approved by the assembly. Articles 171 to 173 were passed as originally proposed. Deliberations continued on Chapter XII, "Supplementary Provisions." Article 174 was passed as originally proposed. For Article 175, "1. All laws and orders that conflict with the Constitution shall be invalid. 2. Laws that are invalid according to the preceding paragraph shall be declared invalid by the President after the Supreme Court has prepared an opinion and submitted it to the National Assembly or the National Assembly Committee for decision," the assembly revised the first paragraph to read, "Laws that conflict with the Constitution shall be invalid; orders that conflict with the Constitution or laws shall be invalid." For Article 176, "The interpretation of the Constitution shall be decided by the National Assembly or the National Assembly Committee after the Supreme Court has prepared an opinion and submitted it," the assembly revised it to read, "The interpretation of the Constitution shall be made by the Judicial Yuan." Article 177 was revised to read, "The Constitution may not be amended without a proposal by at least one-fourth of all representatives of the National Assembly, the attendance of at least three-fourths, and a resolution by at least two-thirds of the representatives present." The second paragraph, "Proposals to amend the Constitution shall be announced by the proposers one year before the opening of the National Assembly," remained unchanged. Article 178 was passed as originally proposed. The second reading of the entire Constitution Draft was completed, and a meeting was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 16th for the third reading.

<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian Provincial Government telegraphed the Executive Yuan that the people in southwestern Fujian are in dire need of food. The Xiamen Customs must verify the passports of the provincial government before releasing food exports. Chairman Chiang ordered that it be handled accordingly. The Executive Yuan stated that the transfer of rice and wheat within the country should be absolutely free-flowing and that obstruction should be prohibited, and orders had already been issued to comply. The current situation in Fujian Province, where there is a shortage of rice and food is insufficient for the people, stipulates that food exports must be verified with passports before release, which is for the purpose of maintaining the people's food supply and taking into account military use. The situation is naturally different, and temporary approval may be granted.

<p>The local China Industrial Bank has recently experienced operational difficulties and liquidity problems and announced its closure the other day. Its affiliated China Qunyi Banking Group has also been affected by the same issue. It is very easy for a relatively small bank to run aground due to temporary business setbacks. However, the current difficulties of this type of bank and other small-scale commercial institutions seem to have become a non-accidental phenomenon. In this regard, we sincerely hope that the banking community and all sectors of society can take responsibility and find a proper solution to this problem. According to reports, the China Industrial Bank was established in 1925 and initially had a fairly close relationship with the Zhili warlords. Later, due to political changes, it was taken over by the so-called Qunyi Banking Group. The current deposits are only several hundred thousand yuan, and the other debts are not very complicated. Regardless of the reason for the closure, its impact will not affect the entire financial community in the area. However, from another perspective, the impact of the bank's closure on society cannot be underestimated. At least a certain segment of society will inevitably be hit.</p>
<p>In the current atmosphere of national economic recession, the unique prosperity of the domestic banking industry has become an undeniable fact. The first reason is the banking transformation of money shops. During the advancement of finance, old-fashioned money shops were not suitable for survival, so many money shops were transformed into banks. The second is the money shop transformation of banks. In the current situation of surplus funds in cities, not only are large banks promoting branch expansion, but also many small banks are being established like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, based on the recent development of the banking industry, on the one hand, the concentration of capital in large banks makes it easier to exert the efficiency of banks, which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. On the other hand, the arbitrary establishment of small banks makes it almost impossible to apply supervisory power, which has become a "flaw in the jade" in the domestic financial industry. The future of those small-scale banks that are registered but operate completely freely is indeed very worrying. We believe that this is the core issue of the banking system. Now, in light of the closure of the China Industrial Bank, we feel even more that our views are not mistaken.</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of China's banking industry has been exceptionally rapid compared to the past. The most important mission of the banking industry is to protect domestic capital, especially to be able to protect the savings provided by the middle and lower classes, because this is the main source of national capital supply. At present, the total amount of savings in the country is less than 500 million yuan, which is extremely small, indicating that social credit urgently needs to be promoted and advanced by banks. If the current system of small banks continues to develop unabated, it will not only be a "flaw in the jade" in the banking system, but it will also lead to the loss of protection and promotion of the savings of the middle and lower classes. This is a matter of great importance. Even in the case of the closure of the China Industrial Bank, although the local financial community does not feel particularly affected, the general public's belief in the current financial system will inevitably be discounted. We should take this as a lesson and hope that the banking community and all sectors of society will pay serious attention to it.</p>

<p>Cabinet Reshuffle: The Premier Has a Plan</p>
<p>(Paris) The late Foreign Minister Barthou's state funeral was held today. The sky was gray and a light mist was spreading. French and Yugoslavian flags were hung everywhere, wrapped in black纱. Thousands of people gathered in front of the Invalides Square. Wreaths sent by governments and dignitaries from all over the world were arranged in rows, too numerous to count. President Doumergue delivered a eulogy, describing Barthou's deeds, saying that every act was guided by a fervent patriotic sentiment and was a model for this generation. He then said that Barthou's policy could be summed up in a few words: "To implement a policy of international cooperation with a just and honest attitude. France is willing to invite all nations that have sincerity and the same ideals for civilization, justice, and progress to cooperate." He also said that the Marseille tragedy made the friendship between France and Yugoslavia even closer. (Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The late Foreign Minister's spirit tablet was placed in the clock hall of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, surrounded by huge wreaths presented by monarchs and governments of various countries. Those presented by Japan, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Latvia were among them. There were also wreaths presented by ordinary people who admired Mr. Barthou, but they were all very small. After the coffin started, the pallbearers followed in a procession, including representatives of heads of state from various countries, French President Lebrun, speakers of the two houses of parliament, the diplomatic corps, representatives of various governments, and representatives sent by various organizations. The coffin slowly moved toward the Invalides Square, where Premier Doumergue delivered a speech. The gist of the speech has been reported in the previous dispatch. The main points are added below. Doumergue stated that Barthou was assassinated while working with the Yugoslav authorities to consolidate peace in central Europe in the Adriatic Sea. His death can be said to be of great importance. Barthou originally planned to visit a neighboring country soon to resolve temporary misunderstandings and work together for beneficial efforts. This neighboring country has the closest blood ties with our France. The French Foreign Minister died for world peace, and France's loyalty to Yugoslavia can be guaranteed by the spirit of the deceased Foreign Minister. (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>

However, this move would displease both the left and right wing parties. However, sources close to Doumergue claim that Doumergue has a plan in mind and will announce it tomorrow after the state funeral of Barthou. The cabinet members he assigns will be completely different from what is rumored outside. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>Yugoslavia to Lodge a Serious Protest</p>
<p>Denial from the Hungarian Embassy in Paris</p>
<p>The League of Nations to Intervene Based on the Covenant</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Marseille tragedy is a major international crime. Its origin seems to lie in Hungary. In the desolate village of Inkápostej, about five miles from the Yugoslav border, there is a large farmhouse, which is a training ground for terrorists. This organization was disbanded in April, but the people in the training camp still live nearby. Huszpith, using the alias Novak, and the assassin Kaliman, etc., all held Hungarian passports and came from Budapest. This information was discovered by the police during interrogations of those arrested. Yugoslav officials attach great importance to this news. Although they have decided not to take drastic action immediately, they may lodge a serious protest with Hungary. General opinion in Geneva believes that if the situation in Europe today is the same as in 1914, war would be inevitable. However, the League of Nations can now intervene based on Article 11 of the Covenant. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This April, the Yugoslav government asked the League of Nations to pay attention to the organization established by Croats hiding in Hungary, intending to carry out terrorist activities in Yugoslavia. Now that the Marseille tragedy has occurred, Yugoslavia will definitely raise this matter again and urge the League of Nations to pay attention. Yugoslavia will probably also make a stern representation to Hungary. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Hungarian Embassy here is making every effort to deny that Kaliman, the murderer of King Alexander of Yugoslavia, is a member of a Croatian organization within Hungary. It regrets the arbitrary involvement of the Hungarian state in the Marseille tragedy. Furthermore, it claims that the Hungarian police have never even heard of a person named Kaliman.

<p>Yugoslavia Protests to Italy</p>
<p>(Belgrade) Since the assassination of King Alexander, there have been demonstrations in various parts of the country against Italy and Hungary. The governments of both Italy and Yugoslavia are now taking preventive measures in areas bordering Trieste, Ljubljana, and Zadar to prevent people from becoming agitated and holding demonstrations that could damage relations with neighboring countries. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade The authorities here are extremely uneasy about Italy's attitude towards Yugoslavia. It is reported that the Yugoslav government has protested to the Italian government because Italian radio stations have been broadcasting criticisms of the current situation in Yugoslavia for days, even yesterday with a broadcast saying that Yugoslavia is on the verge of collapse, which is considered an unfriendly act. Political circles deeply hope that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. However, it is reported that the Italian garrison in Zadar, on the Adriatic Sea, has been greatly increased, which is seen here as an unnecessary move. The Yugoslav people firmly believe that Italy is currently supporting the Croatian Revolutionary Organization as a way to improve relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome Italian public opinion is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the political impact of the Marseille tragedy. All newspapers unanimously hope that internal order in Yugoslavia will not be disturbed, and believe that the King's visit to France was originally the beginning of a policy of international reconciliation. Even though Alexander is dead, they still hope that this policy can continue. As for the anti-Italian demonstrations by the Yugoslav people, most newspapers, except for a few, do not mention them at all. Regarding rumors that Italy has dispatched troops to border areas, newspapers have confirmed that this is not true, stating that the measures taken are preventive, with the sole purpose of avoiding incidents. Not only Italy, but Yugoslavia has also taken such measures. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A representative of the Star newspaper asked Lord Tyrrell, the former British Ambassador to France, for his opinion on the Marseille tragedy. The newspaper representative asked, "King Alexander of Yugoslavia was brutally murdered in Marseille. In your opinion, what impact will this have on the future?" Tyrrell replied, "I have browsed through history and have never seen the same cause produce the same effect. This time, the assassin Kariman's assassination of the Yugoslav King is absolutely the same as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo in June 1914. However, although the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered the outbreak of the European War, the tragedy of King Alexander of Yugoslavia, as evidenced by historical experience, may not have the same impact. You can rest assured." (12th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) French police authorities today have obtained the list of Kariman's accomplices. Iven Lai District, also known as Iven Pennis, after a night of questioning, finally admitted his participation in the assassination and truthfully confessed other accomplices. (13th Kuomintang dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Novak, who was arrested yesterday at a hotel in Solothurn, suspected of being involved in the Marseille tragedy, confessed to the French police today that his original name was Huspith. He had repeatedly committed murder in his own country and was sentenced to death, so he fled Yugoslavia, took refuge in Hungary, hid in a displaced persons camp, and received terrorist training. Later, he received a special mission and went to Zurich with two other Croats, where he contacted Kariman, the assassin of King Alexander of Yugoslavia, and another Croat named Charles. They then went to Fontainebleau. Shortly after, they split into two groups and proceeded separately. He and the original two went to Paris, while Kariman and Charles went to Marseille. If he had received instructions to assassinate the Yugoslav King, he would have unhesitatingly implemented them. The French police authorities are now continuing to interrogate the detained Novak and Pennis. Today, they claimed to have definitively determined that these two belong to the Baberli hub terrorist group in Yugoslavia. It has also been ascertained that they received instructions on October 9th, went to Lausanne from France, passed through Evian, and stayed temporarily in Solothurn. It has been found that Novak had two altercations with the French police and was expelled from France. Judging from the confessions of those arrested, the terrorist group planned three steps to ensure that the Yugoslav King would be killed. If the assassination in Marseille failed, they would try to destroy the train King Alexander was traveling on in Lyon. If that failed again, they would meet King Alexander in Paris with pistols and bombs. (12th Social Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Anamas, France After days of rigorous investigation by the French police, the details of the conspiracy to assassinate the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia, as well as the names and whereabouts of the assassin's party members, will soon be revealed. The main culprit, Kalman, whose real name is Suk, has a total of five party members, two of whom, using the names Peines and Novak, were arrested near here yesterday. After a lengthy interrogation, Pei admitted that his real name was Raiciri K. A Yugoslavian. Novak also revealed his real name and details of the conspiracy today. It is said that his real name is Bosdihichicfuvonimi, born near Bukovina in Bosnia Province, Yugoslavia. Years ago, he was sentenced to death in absentia for killing many policemen and the manager of a newspaper. He fled to Austria, then to Hungary, where he and several other party members who had fled there successively gathered. Not long after, they went from Hungary to Germany, stayed in Seng City, met other party members, and accompanied two party members to Zurich, Switzerland, where they found Suk and another party member, a group of five, and took the route to Lausanne and arrived in Paris. After passing through the city of Fontainebleau, they temporarily separated to avoid suspicion. After several days, Suk and a person named Chernitz left Paris (Novak refused to reveal where they went). At the same time, Nomou and Finnes stayed in Paris waiting for orders. After the murder occurred, Novak and Fei wanted to return to Lausanne and were arrested on the way. Novak also said that if the leader ordered him to assassinate Alexander, he would sacrifice his own life without hesitation in order to fulfill his promise. Of the above five party members, only the whereabouts of the fifth person are unknown, and it is feared that he is hiding in the forest. It is likely that this person is the envoy of the leader of the Croatian national movement. The police interrogation of Novak has not yet ended, and Finnes will continue to be questioned tomorrow. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Anamas The police interrogated Raiciri K., i.e., the real name of Peines. Lai admitted that his party member Posdihic, i.e., the real name of Novak. In yesterday's confession, Raiciri K. left Yugoslavia in 1928 and lived in Hungary in 1932, joining the terror group named "Berbuli District." Raiciri K. confessed that a strange man, nicknamed "Dr. Mr.", waited for him and his companions in Lausanne to come to Paris together. The four accomplices of Kariman were all purchased new clothes with funds from this strange man, part of which was purchased in Lausanne and part of which was prepared in Paris. Posdihic and Raiciri K. will be sent to the Saint Cerile or Alais district court for trial. (13th Havas dispatch)</p>

Also, at eight o'clock this morning, a businessman saw a tired person on the same underground tram, whose appearance was also similar to Cherni.

<p>Resolutely Opposes Changing the Ratio</p>
<p>Japan Purposely Shows Disregard</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States has now decided to take a wait-and-see attitude towards Japan's proposal at the naval talks to be held in London in October. Tokyo is keeping silent about what Japan proposed at the London talks, but hints that Japan will suggest abolishing the Washington and London Naval Treaties. The 5:5:3 naval ratio stipulated in the Washington Treaty will be abolished and replaced by a total tonnage system. It is expected here that the total tonnage required by Japan will exceed the existing tonnage. Acting Secretary of State Moore said that the United States has agreed to discuss the substantive issues of naval armaments. The US delegation will listen to Japan's suggestions while explaining the US position. However, all parties have indicated that the United States expects that Japan will definitely demand the abolition of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. The United States is now prepared to act alone in the Pacific after the treaty is canceled, that is, to strengthen the defense of the Pacific, regardless of how other naval powers do so. Most observers say that the recent developments in the Pacific are sufficient to indicate the intention of the US Navy in this regard. Recently, US naval aircraft flew from San Diego to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. News of the establishment of an air force base near Dutch Harbor has not been formally denied. U.S. submarines have also sailed from Hawaii to Alaska, and naval aircraft are planning to fly from Hawaii to Dutch Harbor. Since Japan's intention to abolish the naval treaty has been raging among the public, naval officials here have revealed plans to defend Guam, Wake Island, and Mitchell Island. The above-mentioned islands are US territories in the Pacific and are prohibited from being defended by the Washington Treaty. Secretary of the Navy Swanson and naval admirals have repeatedly stated that the United States will resolutely oppose changing the naval ratio at future naval conferences. In order to strengthen the power of this declaration, the United States is now engaged in a ship-building program. Once this plan is completed, the U.S. Navy can reach the limits allowed by the treaty. (12th Kuomintang dispatch) (Tokyo) The Japanese naval authorities strongly refuted the American argument that Japan would be greatly threatened after the agreement to abolish the restrictions on the defense of Pacific islands, saying that they did not care at all. The reasons listed are as follows: 1. After the Washington Naval Treaty is abolished, the United States will intensify the establishment of air and naval bases on islands such as Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, and the United Kingdom will also build bases in Hong Kong and Singapore. However, in the current naval battles, the effectiveness of the bases is very low due to the increased range of warships. The victory or defeat of the naval battle depends entirely on the strength of the fleet. 2. Japan only seeks to prevent foreign fleets from attacking, so it will propose a new arms reduction plan, advocating the abolition of offensive warships. Japan only wants to intercept enemy ships, so it does not care about the military preparations of the UK and the US, such as setting up bases. (13th Hualian dispatch)</p>

(12th Kuomintang dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post published an article discussing the impact of the rise in silver prices on China's monetary system, saying, "There is a strange thing in this problem, that is, President Roosevelt considers currency devaluation to be an important factor in domestic recovery, while at the same time considering the increase in China's currency price to be beneficial to China. In other words, the US President is implementing a severe inflationary policy at home, while at the same time forcing China to raise its currency prices. Such a contradictory thing, I really don’t know how Washington will reconcile it." (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the silver market situation, people here have noticed that not only has the selling trend in China slowed down, but in recent days it has also begun to purchase silver. Rumor has it that the Chinese government intends to take various measures to protect the country's commerce from the continued rise in silver prices. People in the Far East banking community do not pay much attention to this statement. The export of silver in the British market is significantly lower than the import volume. People generally believe that this is due to local purchases by speculators. At present, from a technical point of view, although the silver market is very bullish, if the United States unexpectedly changes its silver policy, the market situation may change.

<p>The Military Persists in the Original Plan</p>
<p>Publishes a Statement Explaining the Reasons</p>
<p>Inevitable Serious Disputes</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After consulting with the Cabinet's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs on the situation where the commander of the military police in the institutions in Manchuria concurrently serves as the chief of police, the Army issued a statement in the form of a statement from the authorities as follows:</p>
<p>In order to achieve the purpose of guarding and maintaining the security of Manchuria, the joint cooperation and coordination of military and police agencies is absolutely necessary. Therefore, there have been continuous efforts. As for the police of all consulates in Manchuria, the embassy has established a police affairs department to unify the police of various consulates. The head of the department is concurrently held by the commander of the military police. In addition, the railway police of the Manchurian Railway are also under the command of the commander of the military police. Other necessities for the joint defense, guarding, and maintenance of security between Japan and Manchuria are also under the command of the commander of the military police. Therefore, the police affairs relations in Manchuria are maintained and coordinated with each other through the control of the commander of the military police, and the effect has been achieved in maintaining security. In the inseparable relationship, if it is understood that the joint cooperation of police affairs in the Guandong State and its affiliated land and outside the affiliated land is beneficial, then one should know the reason why the civilian position of the chief of police affairs in the institutions in Manchuria is held by the military officer who is the commander of the military police. (13th Dentong dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs intended to issue a statement in opposition to the lengthy opinion issued by the Ministry of the Army, but Okada, who also served as the Minister of Colonial Affairs, stopped it, so it was abandoned. (13th Japan United dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Army issued a statement in the form of a statement, even the Cabinet is worried that the satisfactory resolution of the reform of the institutions in Manchuria has become hopeless. The government is now waiting for the result of Director-General Hishikari's efforts to resolve the situation, but the Army issued a statement at this time, indicating that the military department disregarded Director-General Hishikari's mediation and expressed its determination to forcibly implement the established policy. It seems that the military department believes that the government's measures are moderate, so it advocates the implementation of the reform plan. Therefore, it seems that there is no room for compromise. In this way, whether the government will block with the dissolution of the Cabinet and submit the revised version of the reform plan to the Cabinet meeting, or it will only implement the policy of the military department. Therefore, the political situation is also on the verge of danger. If the Cabinet does not find a satisfactory solution, some people advocate that the reform plan should not be submitted to the temporary parliament for the time being. However, if the government adopts such appeasement measures, it will only give the Seiyukai an excuse to impeach. Therefore, the political world is also very nervous. (13th Dentong dispatch)</p>
<p>Lushun The general meeting of the staff of the Guandong Office was held at the Higher Girls' School yesterday. More than a thousand staff members attended. Director Nakamura of the Finance Bureau reported on the results of various coordination, and all unanimously advocated the policy of the Guandong Office staff's complete cost. The action was misunderstood, or it was said that the office staff was shaken due to the insecurity of their position, or it was said that the opposition point was limited to the issue of the military police commander's concurrent position. All of these are misinterpretations of the office staff's claims. Therefore, at this time, we should strongly advocate: 1. To establish a civil administration. 2. To ensure the administrative power of the affiliated land. The following claims are then published: 1. All officials of the administrative affairs office of the Office for Manchurian Affairs shall be filled by civil officials. 2. Complete the organization of the administrative affairs office so that there will be no regrets in the implementation of national policy toward Manchuria. (13th Dentong dispatch)</p>

<p>Central Army Uses Land and Air Forces</p>
<p>Last Stronghold Can Be Taken Any Day</p>
<p>Madrid: With the help of bombing aircraft, government forces captured the northern station of Oviedo, the capital of Asturias Province, this afternoon. This is the rebels' last stronghold. The rebels attempted to escape by train, but they were shelled by the army. It is expected that the army will completely control the city tonight. One hundred rebels, hiding in a mine shaft, were buried alive when a shell landed and destroyed the entrance. It is reported that 150 rebels died in the village of Campomanes yesterday. Today, a shell struck a small house storing bombs and other supplies, causing more deaths. Two government planes assisting in the battle collided in the sky. One crashed and was destroyed. The captain and lieutenant on board were severely injured. (Reuter's dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The prior announcement by the Spanish government that the city of Oviedo had been recovered by the central army is not yet a confirmed fact according to reliable reports. The central army only occupies an area outside the city and a fortress, while the rebel army is still fighting fiercely. Their strong defense line will not be destroyed by the central army for the time being. Currently, the national army is using aircraft to bomb the Oviedo armory, as it has become the rebel army's source of military supplies since being captured by the rebels. However, several aircraft attacked carelessly, affecting the railway. A train approaching Oviedo was completely destroyed by the bombing. A convoy of trucks carrying troops, totaling fourteen freight cars, was also destroyed by the aircraft's bombs. In the small villages of Asturias, the rebel army is still fighting stubbornly, but the photographs taken by the aircraft show that the rebel army is at the end of its rope. Their nests are gradually being occupied by the central army. It is also reported that the central army's killings of the rebel army are quite brutal, especially towards foreign mercenary soldiers. A famous 14th-century church in Oviedo, containing many priceless works of art, has been completely burned down, but the cause of the fire, whether due to careless handling or misdirected bombing, is not yet known.

<p>Lawyer Claims to be a Creditor of the Railway Department</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Officials from the Tokyo District Court, accompanied by a lawyer, suddenly arrived at Tokyo Station at noon on the 13th and met with the stationmaster, declaring that they were sealing Tokyo Station. The stationmaster was very shocked and told them that no agency could seal a national transportation agency, and asked for the reason. The lawyer immediately replied that he had a claim against the Railway Department, and after five years of no intention to repay the debt, he had asked the court to enforce the sealing of Tokyo Station, a part of the state-owned railway property, in accordance with the law. After speaking, they rushed into the first-class and second-class ticket offices and took all the cash on hand into their hats. The stationmaster immediately reported to the Railway Department and the Metropolitan Police Department, requesting them to send personnel, and charged the two with obstructing official duties.

<p>Scheduled to be Completed Next Year</p>
<p>Coastal Area Already Designated as a Military Zone</p>
<p>Singapore Correspondence: Although Singapore is a small island with an area of only 217 square miles, its importance is probably unmatched by any other British colony in the world. Singapore is not only the capital of British Malaya and the center of Nanyang commerce, but also the base of British power in the Far East. As it is the bulwark of India and can control Australia and Hong Kong, Britain has long paid close attention to Singapore. Since Japan violently occupied our Northeast four provinces and tore up international peace treaties, Britain has become even more active in fortifying Singapore. In terms of the navy, thousands of workers are hired every day, working day and night, striving to complete its world's largest naval base. In terms of the air force, large squadrons of military aircraft are concentrated, practicing combat in the air day and night, and the sound of anti-aircraft guns often echoes the sound of aircraft. The local residents are no longer surprised by this because they are used to seeing it. In terms of the army, forts and barracks are being built on a large scale, and soldiers are stationed. According to observations by a British military expert, after Singapore's naval base is fully completed, a force of 70,000 troops will be required to defend it. The authorities have announced that Singapore's naval base will be completed next year, so British army units have been continuously transferred to Singapore. As for how much military strength Singapore currently has, because it is a military matter, the authorities are keeping it secret, and we have no way of knowing. However, judging from the new barracks springing up like bamboo shoots after rain and the continuous arrival of ships loaded with troops from other places concentrating on Singapore, and the coastal area has been designated as a military zone, it can be seen that the situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and the outbreak of a world war is imminent.

<p>Contract: Factors favoring market conditions before the opening of securities trading were: (1) Washington's denial of the resurgence of inflation, and (2) the Ministry of Finance's repayment of 187 million yuan in Fourth Liberty Bonds. These two events demonstrate the Ministry of Finance's determination to maintain an orthodox policy regarding finance. Factors unfavorable to market conditions were: (1) the denial of another devaluation of the US dollar, which may discourage inflationists and lead to large-scale profit-taking by multiple parties towards the end of the week, (2) the commercial index decreased from 65.4 to 63.5, and (3) the number of freight cars loaded last week totaled 631,000, a decrease of 31,000 compared to the same period last year. This morning, the securities market opened with a looser atmosphere, and the prices of various stocks fell, ranging from a few cents to one and a half pounds. Major securities were particularly affected. There are signs in the market of further price declines due to profit-taking. The New York Stock Exchange prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Has Advanced to Changting</p>
<p>| The Southern Route Army Will Attack Ruijin from Junmen |</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: The Eastern Route Army attacked Changting, and the Northern Route Army attacked *Shicheng, achieving successive victories in recent days. The main force of the bandits has been shaken, and their internal structure has collapsed, scattering and retreating southward. Previously, the bandits had built strong defensive fortifications in the mountains bordering Ting and Lian, and deployed defensive lines with Zhongwu Village as the first line, Nanshanba as the second line, Hetian as the third line, and the area outside Changting City along the Jinsha Creek Widow's Bridge as the fourth line. The Eastern Route Army recovered Zhongwu Village on the 29th. It is reported that more than 2,400 bandits were killed in this battle. On the 30th, the Eastern Route Army searched the highlands north and south of Huangyi and advanced towards the bandits' second line of defense, Nanshanba. The pseudo Fifth and Ninth Army Corps first camped on the northwest highlands, building trenches and minefields. Fighting began on the morning of the 4th, and by 2 PM, the National Army charged forward, killing more than 200 bandits from the pseudo 24th Division and capturing dozens of bandits. The remaining bandits retreated towards Hetian. Nanshanba is 12 li from Hetian and 50 li from Changting City, indicating that the Eastern Route Army has fully entered the territory of Ting. As for the Southern Route Army, it is now preparing to attack Ruijin, cutting off the bandits' retreat route southward. The National Army stationed in Junmen is reportedly already on the move. The bandits in Changting City are camped along the Ting River outside the city, occasionally scurrying to Dabagu Mu Village and Diaoyi, which are very close to Lanjia Ferry in Fengren City. The National Army stationed in Fengren City, Shanghang, consisting of the forces of Zeng Da-yu and Zhong Shao-kui, repelled the bandits in Diaoyi on the 5th. These bandits were the pseudo 24th Division, belonging to the pseudo Third Army Corps and the pseudo Fifth Army, who had fled from Nanshanba, numbering approximately 2,000. In recent days, in areas not far from the Southern Route Army's positions on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, such as Tanghu Da Shan, Mao Village's Bei Da Shan, and the Junmen Ridge area, many scattered bandits have been discovered, each group numbering between one and several hundred. Currently, the Huang Ren-huan Division is advancing northward towards Hangwu to search and suppress them. (August 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">A GlimPSE OF SOCIETY IN BEIPING <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>A Beggar Group Discovered in a Detoxification Center</p>
<p>A Red Actress Detained by the Puppet Government</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the municipal government of Beiping vigorously implemented drug prohibition, two achievements have been most notable: 1) The Japanese Embassy has agreed that Korean nationals involved in drug trafficking will be punished entirely by Chinese law, which hopefully will eliminate the source of white powder in the future; 2) The detoxification center established by the municipal government has helped a large number of addicts to quit. Due to the center's well-equipped facilities and treatment, many addicts have been voluntarily reporting to the police stations and applying for admission. There have even been cases of entire families, including the elderly and young children, claiming to be addicted and willingly undergoing detoxification. According to the authorities at the center, as of today (the 10th), there have been more than ninety such petition-style family detoxification groups. The presence of such large groups of men, women, the old, and the young has suddenly transformed the atmosphere of the center, with noisy cries of children, resembling a bizarre exhibition of drug-addicted families. The authorities are urgently seeking remedies for this situation and have launched a thorough investigation. They have discovered a significant underlying issue: these so-called "voluntary detoxification" family groups are not actually addicted to drugs. Instead, they are families of impoverished people with no means of livelihood. They claim to be addicted to drugs due to hunger and cold, willing to impersonate drug offenders to get the "wowo tou" (cornbread) provided by the center for ten days a month, in order to prolong their family's near-starvation existence. After discovering this problem, the center's authorities, realizing that they could not accommodate so many disaster victims, have taken measures to send those already admitted to charitable organizations that provide relief to the starving. They have also revised the regulations, stipulating that anyone found to have falsely claimed addiction will be required to reimburse the cost of their food, clothing, lodging, and medicine, and will be sent to the Public Works and Public Security Bureaus for a short period of forced labor. This approach aims to provide relief to the starving while preventing fraudulent applications. However, the fact that good citizens are willing to falsely claim to be drug offenders and hope to be admitted to the detoxification center as a family reveals the extreme poverty of the lower strata of Beiping society, reaching a point of "one step away from death." This can be seen in the discovery of this dark reality. Beiping is the birthplace of "actresses." Since the government moved south, daughters from prominent families have abandoned their studies to learn acting. Not only descendants of the fallen Qing dynasty aristocracy, but even daughters of current university professors and city councilors, are openly learning acting and advertising themselves in newspapers, claiming to be raised by adoptive mothers. (Last year, Liang Jiayi, the district head of the Ping City Self-Government District, died in the hospital due to compulsory smoking cessation enforced by the city authorities. His daughter, Liang Yunqiu, told reporters that her father held a university teaching position and had a substantial income, so she could spend half her time learning acting without neglecting her studies. Now that her father had passed away and she was unable to continue her studies, she would use her skills to serve society and support her elderly mother, etc.). This is certainly due to economic reasons, but it also demonstrates that Beiping society generally recognizes acting as a shortcut to wealth. However, examining the past history of actresses, those who achieved great fame in Beiping, such as Liu Xikui, Xian Lingzhi, and Zhang Eyun, may have been fortunate on stage, but they all met with unfortunate ends in their personal lives. Recently, the famous Tsing Yi actress, Xue Yanqin (real name Huang Yongni), sold herself to Pu Gong, the younger brother of the puppet emperor, for 100,000 gold. While society has widely circulated stories about her building a luxurious residence in Dalian and visiting the traitor Pu in Changchun, and some even claimed that she was studying at the Tokyo School of Foreign Languages, attending classes with female students from various countries, including Europe, America, and Turkey, and behaving lavishly, socializing with Japanese noblewomen. In reality, Xue has been abandoned by Pu Gong and has long been in a difficult situation. According to news from Tianjin, Xue was abandoned by Pu Gong, who had recently become infatuated with a Japanese prostitute. Yesterday, she secretly fled to Tanggu and boarded the Japanese ship Changchun Maru. However, just as she was about to disembark, she was abducted by two Japanese soldiers and taken back to Dalian. Currently, the Huang residence in Beiping (the residence of Xue's parents in Beiping) has received a secret letter from the actress, pleading with her family to send someone to Changchun to rescue her. This can also serve as a lesson for those who "recognize a thief as a father." (10th)</p>

<p>Implementing a Ban on Opium Poppy Cultivation</p>
<p>| The Provincial Government Announces Measures to Prohibit Cultivation |</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Although Fujian Province has implemented a public monopoly on opium paste, with the Hubei Opium Prohibition Supervisory Office sending personnel to Fujian to establish offices and contract with merchants to organize companies to handle it by region, only opium from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou is sold. The cultivation of opium in Fujian Province is still strictly prohibited. The provincial government has now formulated measures to prohibit opium poppy cultivation and has issued an order to all administrative inspectors and commissioners to comply with it, in order to strengthen opium prohibition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Before the opium poppies are sown: 1) Each administrative inspector and commissioner and county magistrate should issue and widely post notices, and distribute short notices stating that the cultivation of opium is strictly prohibited and violators will be executed, posting them in every village. 2) Each administrative inspector and commissioner should supervise the county magistrates to instruct the district offices to convene large meetings to prohibit opium cultivation, inviting representatives from various sectors of the Party, government, military, and education to attend. They should hold open-air lectures or organize propaganda teams to give lectures and prepare shoulder boards, sending people to beat gongs to promote the prohibition. County magistrates should personally attend the meetings in districts where opium cultivation has been more prevalent in the past. 3) Administrative inspectors and commissioners should supervise county magistrates to instruct district offices to order the heads of baojia (collective security units) to individually admonish each household and obtain written pledges stating "If I dare to plant opium, I will willingly accept the death penalty," and submit them to the county government for safekeeping. This may be waived in areas where it is deemed unnecessary to obtain pledges.</p>
<p>(B) When the opium is being sown: 1) Each administrative inspector and commissioner should issue an order to each county, instructing the district offices to supervise the heads of baojia to inspect the planting areas within their districts. If opium cultivation is discovered, the opium seeds should be immediately uprooted and the planters arrested and brought to justice. In districts where baojia heads have not yet been established, the district chiefs should be responsible for assigning people to conduct inspections. 2) District chiefs should regularly assess the diligence of all personnel under their jurisdiction and personally conduct inspections. Any officials who perform poorly should be reported to the county for punishment, and the inspection report should be submitted to the county for verification. 3) County magistrates should conduct spot checks on the situation in various districts, submit reports to the administrative inspectors and commissioners for verification, and forward them to the provincial government. District chiefs who fail to implement the measures effectively should be reported for punishment. 4) Administrative inspectors and commissioners should dispatch commissioners to conduct re-inspections in various counties. If county magistrates or military police are found to be shielding or condoning opium cultivation, they should immediately report it in secret to the commissioner's office and forward it to the provincial government for review and action.</p>
<p>(C) When the opium poppies sprout: 1) Each county magistrate should instruct the district offices to order the baojia heads to regularly survey the planting areas within their respective jurisdictions. If opium seedlings are discovered, they should immediately report it in secret to the district office for uprooting, and the planters should be arrested and brought to justice. In districts where baojia heads have not yet been established, the district chiefs should be responsible for handling the matter. 2) District chiefs should conduct occasional inspections in their respective districts</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>and submit reports to the county for verification. If opium seedlings are discovered, they should be immediately eradicated, and the planters should be arrested and brought to justice, and the baojia heads should be reported to the county for punishment. 3) County magistrates should conduct spot checks on the handling of affairs in various districts, and first ascertain the period when opium seedlings in the county emerge and can be identified. They should report it to the administrative inspector and commissioner for verification and forwarding to the provincial government to determine the date for on-site inspection. The county magistrates should personally inspect each district. If opium seedlings are discovered, in addition to immediately supervising the police and militia to eradicate them and arrest the offenders for prosecution, they should also report the responsible officials at all levels for punishment. In areas bordering two or more counties, joint inspections should be conducted. 4) After the county magistrates have completed their inspections, the administrative inspectors and commissioners should, together with personnel dispatched by the provincial government, conduct re-inspections in various counties. If opium seedlings are discovered, in addition to supervising the eradication and severely punishing the planters, they should report the responsible county magistrates, district chiefs, and officials at all levels to the provincial government for punishment. 5) Administrative inspectors and commissioners may bring troops with them when inspecting and eradicating opium seedlings. 6) Administrative inspectors and commissioners may, when necessary, consult with the garrison troops for assistance or request the provincial government to send troops.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Hubei Province Again Abolishes Excessive Taxes and Levies <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Sixty-four Types of Taxes Abolished in Thirty-nine Counties and Cities</p>
<p>Totaling One Million Yuan, Including Reductions in Land Tax</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Government, in accordance with a clear order from the Central Government, is thoroughly abolishing excessive local taxes and levies in order to reduce the burden on the people. The Department of Finance was tasked with planning the measures. In the first phase, twenty-seven types of excessive taxes and levies were abolished in seven cities, including Yichang, Shashi, Xinti, Wuxue, Laohekou, Fancheng, and Shayang, reducing the burden by over 280,000 yuan annually. This was implemented on July 1st. Subsequently, due to severe floods and droughts, excessive taxes and levies in other counties have not been completely abolished, and the people are increasingly unable to bear the burden. The provincial government then ordered the Department of Finance to plan a second phase of abolishing excessive taxes and levies. This has now been finalized. The items to be abolished include: In the First Administrative District, Puqi: special tea merchant tax, fish industry shop tax, hemp industry shop tax; Hanyang: bamboo and timber tax, door tax, house tax; Caidian: business contribution, fish fry dike tax; Jiayu: public security miscellaneous tax, flower, hemp, silk, and bean tax; Xianning: special business tax, business education tax, boat household public security tax, tea, hemp, and paper business tax.

In the Fourth Administrative District, Huangpi: public security business tax, wheel tax; Lishan: oil pressing tax. In the Fifth Administrative District, Xiaogan: public security business tax; Yingcheng: public welfare tax. In the Sixth Administrative District, Tianmen: door tax; Hanchuan: water police miscellaneous tax; Mianyang: silk, flower, and egg tax. In the Seventh Administrative District, Jiangling: salt jin surcharge; Songzi: cotton tax, naked stone tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, oil pressing tax, miscellaneous grain tax; Jianli: bamboo and timber tax, flower package tax. In the Eighth Administrative District, Yicheng: door grain cotton tax; Guanghua: oil pressing industry tax, cotton ginning tax; Gucheng: business shop surcharge; Baokang: lodging tax. In the Ninth Administrative District, Yuan'an: paper trough tax, public welfare tax; Yidu: entertainer tax; Xingshan: salt merchant shop tax, almanac tax; Zigui: special export goods tax, salt tax, military reception fee, special goods public welfare tax, aviation patriotic contribution; Wufeng: salt tax, timber tax, lacquer knife tax, tea tax, tung oil tax, paper trough tax; Changyang: household tax, paper trough tax. In the Tenth Administrative District, Xuan'en: security monthly contribution; Badong: almanac tax; Hefeng: business protection tax, lacquer tax, tea tax; Lichuan: intermediary tax; Xianfeng: market business tax; Laifeng: grass tobacco tax. In the Eleventh Administrative District, Junxian: public security tax, incense tax, tobacco leaf tax, tung oil tax; Yunxi: salt brokerage tax, inn tax; Zhushan: temporary military transport tax, salt boat tax, cotton tax; Zhuxi: tobacco and alcohol tax; Wuxue: salt merchant assistance donation, wharf tax. The above totals sixty-four types of taxes and levies in thirty-nine counties and one city, amounting to 452,198 yuan. These funds were originally used for education, security, county administration, baojia, police administration, new construction, and various military service supplies, but they have all been completely abolished. As for the reduction in land tax surcharges, they include: Wuchang field mu donation, Xianning field mu donation, Echeng field mu donation, Xishui land tax surcharge county administration and education donations, Huangmei land tax surcharge education donation, Guangji field mu donation, Luotian ticket surtax school donation, Macheng field mu donation, Hanchuan field mu donation, Shishou field mu surcharge education donation, Baokang field mu surcharge, Dangyang field mu surcharge, Xingshan land tax surtax education donation, Zigui property securities, land tax post-war donation, Dingtun surtax school donation, Dingtun surtax public security donation, Jianshi field mu donation, Badong ticket surtax county administration donation, Laifeng ticket surtax school donation, Junxian ticket surtax collection fee, Fangxian ticket surtax collection fee, Zhushan advance grain county administration donation, advance mu donation, Zhuxi field mu surcharge, land tax surtax administrative fee, totaling twenty-one counties, reducing revenue by 520,221 yuan.

<p>By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Ta'er Monastery, Birthplace of the Founder of Yellow Sect Buddhism (Part II)</p>
<p>The Lesser Golden Tile Temple has two stories and contains Buddhist statues that are grotesque and terrifying, along with an assortment of ancient hunting implements such as bows and arrows, spears and halberds, spiked maces, knives and guns, ferocious masks, iron chain armor, etc., as well as specimens of lions, tigers, bears, leopards, apes, wild oxen, and other wild beasts. Worshippers splatter butter oil all over the Buddhist statues and specimens and stick copper coins on them, creating an unpleasant, greasy smell. Only the roof tiles, said to be the same as those of the Great Golden Tile Temple, are made of copper and gilded, with a gleaming golden color that reflects and complements each other, making them the monastery's most dazzling adornments.</p>
<p>"Da Jin Wa" (transliteration) is the residence of the Living Buddha, distributed east and west with a total of sixteen courtyards. Banners are erected in front of the gates, towering into the sky. The "Chop Altar Tree" (transliteration) grows next to the Great Golden Tile Temple. Legend says that when Tsongkhapa was born, his blood spilled on the ground, and this tree grew from it. The trunk is like a peach tree, with transparent bark that reveals textures resembling Tibetan script. It is also said that in ancient times, a small Living Buddha could often be seen sitting on the leaves of the tree on Mid-Autumn Night. There are many similar mystical anecdotes associated with the monastery. The kitchen of the Great Golden Tile Temple contains three large iron pots, each measuring one square zhang (approximately 3.3 meters). Each pot can hold enough to cook nine cows. The walls are lined with thousands of tea bowls, used for cooking tea and rice during major gatherings. When the food is cooked, the cooks first tie iron ropes around their waists, securing the other end to a pillar, and then use long ladles to scoop out the food, frequently removing it, to prevent accidentally falling into the pot and becoming cooked themselves. Other halls contain strange statues of different genders embracing each other, some between humans, some between humans and beasts, and some with beast-like demons. Considering their forms and contemplating their intentions, they are similar to the Joyful Buddha. They are all intriguing and inexplicable.</p>
<p>The largest annual event is the Buddha Display Festival, held on the seventh day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. In the morning, an image of Tsongkhapa is carried out and displayed on the hillside, with a solemn chanting ceremony. Tibetan people flock to the gathering in groups of thousands, some prostrating themselves under the image and others worshipping from afar. Finally, everyone throws silver coins at the Buddha image. The merchants who set up stalls on the spot pay heavy rent, making it a major source of income for the monastery. In the afternoon, images of Arhats, Dharma Protectors, and others are dressed up and dance in turn in the Shehuo (community fire) courtyard. Afterward, a triangular wooden tray is used to carry a dough figurine, which is cleaved and sent out, said to be a ritual related to Nian Gengyao killing a Living Buddha. The lamas hate him and fear his reincarnation, so they use Buddhist practices to suppress him. At night, the drums and music are deafening, and visitors are prohibited from watching. It is suspected that the ritual is a ceremony to shoot the image of Nian Gengyao.</p>
<p>The number of lamas and monks was 3,500 twenty years ago, but is now about 2,500. Their organization is roughly divided into the following departments: 1) The Great Dharma Master, who explains Buddhist scriptures, manages the Living Buddhas, and oversees all the affairs of the monastery; 2) The Great Monk Manager, who manages the monks; 3) The First Elder, who is responsible for internal affairs; 4) The Second Elder, who is responsible for foreign affairs and handles the litigation affairs of the Tibetan people in the administered area; 5) The Third Elder, who manages revenue and expenditure; 6) The Buddha Presider, who protects the scripture hall. All are elected to serve rotating terms. The remaining lamas have no rank. They chant scriptures three times a day, or only once if they have official duties. Living Buddha is the Chinese term for lama. After death, the destination of their reincarnation is divined by other Living Buddhas. (In reality, this is often inaccurate, and wealthy families secretly bribe to have their sons selected as Living Buddhas.) At the age of eight or nine, they are welcomed back to the monastery and taught the scriptures by the Great Dharma Master. If a young Living Buddha commits a violation, the Great Dharma Master can reprimand him with a leather whip, but he must bow to him afterward. The other ordinary lamas are called monks. Some are initially sent by the people, providing their own monastic robes and presenting a hada (silk scarf) to the Great Dharma Master and their master. Others who return from other monasteries only present two hundred copper coins, which are returned to them when they leave. If they revert to secular life, they receive nothing. The monastery has over thirty large and small Living Buddhas, living a life of comfort and luxury, like nobles. The thousands of other monks are each provided with only two dou (approx. 20 liters) and one sheng (approx. 1 liter) of grain per year, so they must beg for alms and seek help from relatives. Some even engage in business and lending to make ends meet. Their staple food is tsampa (roasted barley flour) fried with butter oil. They wear robes and aprons and go barefoot without pants. Some wear leather boots. They only wear hats when chanting scriptures.</p>
<p>For funerals, if it is for a monk or an ordinary Living Buddha, they still use the water, fire, or sky burial methods used by the Tibetan people. If it is for a high-ranking and wealthy Living Buddha with private property, the body is dissected, the intestines are removed, and mercury is poured in, or salt mud is applied and changed every few days. The blood that flows out is mixed with white clay, kneaded into balls, and placed in a talismanic Buddha, which is worn for protection, believing it can ward off guns and cannons. The corpse is then cured into jerky, then the dissected area is sewn up, the body is dressed in robes, and gold is applied to the face. It is placed in a gold-inlaid glass niche and displayed in the scripture hall in order, called the gold body of the nth reincarnation of so-and-so Living Buddha.</p>
<p>The monastery's wealth was once said to be enough to pay off the Boxer Indemnity. It is said that during the National Army's garrison in Gansu, a general visited the monastery and stared at the golden tiles for a long time without blinking. The lamas suspected him and quickly raised 300,000 gold, which they presented to the general in cooperation with a Tibetan prince with close ties. The truth is difficult to ascertain, but the 143 monasteries in Qinghai annually support hundreds of thousands of non-productive, leisurely Tibetan monks. Just the cost of three meals a day is considerable. If political means could be used to transfer this wealth to the education and animal husbandry of the Tibetan people, it would passively eliminate superstition and actively increase production. From then on, the national life of the Tibetan people would suddenly erupt with astonishing and world-shaking light.</p>

<p>(IV) Constant</p>
<p>Nanchang has long been known as a land of fish and rice. In the past, it suffered greatly from banditry. The people were displaced and their homes were destroyed. Now that the military operations are coming to an end, the province hopes to recover its vitality in a few years through comprehensive construction. However, after this great disaster, the phenomenon of economic decline is worrying. We can understand its general situation by observing its industries. In Jingdezhen, there used to be 3,000 kilns with one million workers, producing 60 to 70 million taels of porcelain annually. In 1928, there were still 130 kilns with 200,000 to 300,000 workers. Recent investigations show that the annual output is no more than 3 million yuan, and exports to overseas are no more than 70,000 to 80,000 dan (approx. 3.5-4 tons). The tragic decline has led to the complete failure of China's entire porcelain industry, which is truly heartbreaking. Jiangxi's tea has always been famous. In 1928, exports were still over 160,000 dan, but by 1932, it was only 80,000 dan. Jiangxi's paper also occupies a position in China's paper industry. The province produces 6 million yuan worth of paper, most of which is consumed domestically. However, most of the paper consumed in the country is still foreign. Whether Jiangxi's paper can stand firm depends on whether it can be improved and progress. Ramie cloth is a specialty of Jiangxi. According to investigations, in the most prosperous years, the output was 600,000 dan. According to exports from Jiujiang Customs in 1931, it has fallen to just over 70,000 dan, indicating a significant reduction in output. Pingsiang's coal reserves are estimated at 200 trillion tons, and Jiangxi produces tungsten ore, a world-renowned metal, accounting for 50% of the world's production, ranking first in the world. In the years with the most exports, it amounted to 140,000 dan, worth 6 million yuan. In 1932, exports decreased to just over 30,000 dan, worth 800,000 yuan. However, in the event of war in the world, it will still be an important material. Jiangxi's rice used to produce an average of 6.5 million shi (approx. 650,000 tons) annually. After deducting the consumption of the province's population, about 2.5 million shi could be used to supplement the needs of other provinces. However, recently, there have still been imports of rice from other provinces and foreign countries, because agricultural production has decreased, and the military's consumption is large, resulting in insufficient food self-sufficiency in the province. The above is the general situation of Jiangxi's industries. We can also get a glimpse of Jiangxi's economic situation from the import and export statistics of Jiujiang Customs. In 1932, exports were 13,429,599 taels, and imports were 23,599,206 taels, resulting in a trade deficit of over 10 million taels. The reason for the trade deficit is the banditry in the province, which has reduced production. At the same time, the consumption of a large military force has increased the volume of imports. However, what helps to offset this is that hundreds of millions of yuan in military pay are distributed in the market every month, allowing financial circulation. In the future, when the troops withdraw and the bargaining chips decrease, there will be no way to offset the deficit. The wealth of the people will decline, and their purchasing power will weaken. If plans are not made early, the trade deficit will likely increase, and the economic situation will become even more unbearable. The best news we obtained in Nanchang is that Mr. Du Chongyuan is establishing a large-scale porcelain factory. Mr. Lin recently returned from an inspection in Jingdezhen and believes that if political forces can assist, the porcelain industry has the potential for revival. Furthermore, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, recognizing the importance of agricultural production, has recently organized an Agricultural Institute to integrate the province's agricultural administration, education, and technology under its command, with guaranteed independent funding. It advocates integrating agricultural technology with rural construction, which is truly good news for farmers in the province.</p>
<p>The highways that have been opened to traffic in Nanchang include the Gan-Zhejiang, Gan-Hunan, and Gan-Guangdong routes. In addition, what can promote Nanchang's prosperity is the construction of the Gan-Zhejiang and Gan-Hunan railways, which connect to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to the east and the Zhuping Railway to the west. The completion of these two routes will have a huge impact on national defense and commerce. In particular, the commercial and economic value will be even greater. At present, Jiangxi's products rely solely on Jiujiang for transportation. Inland transportation relies on porters and boats, and traffic on the Yangtze River is also slow. With the opening of the Gan-Zhejiang route, the province's products can be concentrated in Nanchang, transported to Hangzhou, and then shipped overseas. The freight costs for rice, porcelain, tea, and Pingsiang coal will be greatly reduced, making it easier to promote commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>The Nanchang exhibition concluded on September 27th, and we returned to Jiujiang. Jiujiang has a population of 70,000 and is a distribution center for goods in Jiangxi. Although it is the end point of the Nanxun Railway, it is only a transfer port. There are few people with consumption power, so it is not easy to revitalize commerce. If the Gan-Zhejiang and Gan-Hunan railways are opened, inland goods will abandon waterways and use land routes, further impacting Jiujiang. It can only hope to find a way out in industrial manufacturing to reverse the decline. Jiujiang has the Jiuxing Textile Company. It is most suitable to set up a porcelain factory in Jiujiang, because it is close to the kaolin clay production area in Xingzi County, making it convenient to obtain materials. The impression of Japanese goods in Jiujiang is not as good as in Nanchang. In order to adapt to the environment, our group shortened the exhibition period by three days and screened the film "China's Silk" for various schools to promote production education. This initiative was well received by the student community. The exhibition period ended on October 4th. Then, we prepared to go to Hankou.</p>

<p>Villagers in Xiajiang Township Obstruct Land Survey</p>
<p>Our county's land survey work began in the old tenth district and has already been completed. However, yesterday, Zhang Zishan, a surveyor from Xiazhuang Township, was suddenly attacked by dozens of villagers while working. The villagers beat the surveyor and took away the measuring rods and tapes. He Xuzu, the leader of the survey team at the location, believed that the villagers were unreasonable and had no choice but to temporarily retreat to avoid confrontation. He reported the situation to the Land Bureau Preparation Office, which forwarded it to the county government for prompt action.</p>

<p>Gamblers Resist Arrest, Assault Police</p>
<p>In Suzhou, every late autumn traditionally involves cricket fighting for gambling. This autumn, due to strict crackdowns by the authorities, crowds are gathering at Jiangdun Village in the Xiangshan area by Taihu Lake to gamble on cricket fights. Many people from neighboring counties also bring crickets to fight, with substantial sums changing hands. On the afternoon of the twelfth, Qin Zhude, a patrol officer from the Guangfu Eighth Precinct, learned of this. That evening, he led his entire shift of police officers to surround Jiangdun Village and make arrests. Unexpectedly, the gamblers resisted as a group, and the police were instead surrounded and violently attacked. As a result, in addition to Qin Zhu being injured in the assault, two other police officers sustained severe injuries and are in critical condition.

<p>Thugs Rob and Kill on the Spot</p>
<p>Lu Weiji, the 48-year-old owner of the Feixia Pavilion teahouse in Xin Sanli Bridge outside the North Gate, has a son and a daughter. The previous evening (the twelfth) around 9 p.m., his daughter, Ji Ying, was carrying her three-year-old younger brother, Sanbao, to the Song Mao Xiang tea shop at the Lao Sanli Bridge to buy tea. Unexpectedly, when they reached the vicinity of Lu Youfeng Lane, they were suddenly confronted by a thug who blocked their way and forcibly snatched the silver anklet from Sanbao's right foot. Ji Ying shouted for help, and passersby, hearing the cry, rushed to apprehend the thief. They managed to capture the thug and severely beat him, resulting in his death amidst the chaos. Afterwards, Wu Qiao Second Police Station of the Fifth Public Security Bureau apprehended a suspect, Ji Luo Zhou, and took him to the station for interrogation. Meanwhile, Bureau member Gu Songxun summoned the Lu family, father and daughter, for questioning. Yesterday morning (the thirteenth) at 9 a.m., Wu Changgen, the Tutouzheng of Tian Si Tu, reported the incident to the local branch of the District Court, requesting an autopsy. The investigating judge, along with Wang, the coroner, proceeded to conduct the autopsy and confirmed that the man had died from the beating. The Tutouzheng was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial, and the suspect was taken to the court for interrogation. It is reported that the deceased was named Xi A Quan, approximately 20 years old, and was a prostitute, who resorted to this desperate measure, resulting in his being beaten to death.</p>

<p>Hua Juchu, the chief of general affairs at the local tobacco and alcohol public sales and excise office, was found to be addicted to opium. He had not registered with the county's anti-opium society. He was reported by a vendor, Wang Zuogeng, and taken to the First Precinct, then transferred to the county's anti-opium society. Yu Quanqing, a clerk, interrogated him. Hua Juchu insisted that he had indeed used opium in the past but had now quit. However, Wang Zuogeng claimed that Hua was a long-time addict of more than twenty years. Their statements conflicted. The court ordered Wang Zuogeng to post bail, while County Magistrate Yan personally instructed Police Chief Wu to keep Hua Juchu under strict surveillance, forbidding anyone from visiting him. Yesterday, he was sent to the rehabilitation center for examination. If the county's examination proves inconclusive, he will be sent to the provincial capital for further examination before a final decision is made.</p>

<p>First Trial Run on the Xichang Highway Results in Overturn</p>
<p>The Xichang Highway, connecting this county and Wuxi, was ordered to be built and has been completed for some time. However, on the side of our county, there are several missing water gullies and soil foundations of bridge piers which have not yet been filled. Therefore, last time, Wang Xiaolai and others, the initiators of the Shanghai-Wuxi Automobile Company, planned to inspect the road from Wuxi to Changshu, but it did not happen because the roadbed was not yet compacted. Now, the Xihu Road Engineering Office received an order from the Construction Department that the Xichang section should be opened to traffic within this month. Therefore, Sun Wei'e, the head of the first section of the road, accompanied by the construction technician and others, totaling seven people, drove a bridge-laying vehicle from Wuxi to Changshu on the twelfth for a trial run. The vehicle also carried pine planks to bridge the water gullies. However, the road had not been rolled and was uneven, making the ride very unstable, especially in the Changshu section. At about 6 p.m. that day, the vehicle reached the Wengjia Village area of Yangjian in this county. Because it was already dusk, they encountered a large water gully, causing the vehicle to suddenly overturn. All the contents of the vehicle were scattered on the ground. Fortunately, the technician and engineers were unharmed. They, along with the villagers, helped to right the vehicle and spent the night in Wengjia Village. They continued driving to Changshu on the morning of the thirteenth.</p>

<p>Bandits Rob and Injure</p>
<p>Zhu Yinsheng, a brick bridge worker from Liyang, walked from Benniu to Changzhou on the evening of the twelfth, intending to take a car to Shanghai to seek a livelihood. When he was walking through the Lushen Hou Tangshen Port area along the railway outside the North Gate, he suddenly encountered seven or eight bandits armed with guns, who shouted at him to stop. They stepped forward to search Zhu's person. At that time, it was not yet late, and there were pedestrians coming and going. Fearing that he would raise the alarm, the bandits pulled out a pistol and aimed it at Zhu's head, shooting him. Zhu immediately fell to the ground, two front teeth were knocked out, and blood flowed freely. All the seventeen yuan he had hidden and a bag of clothes were robbed. Afterwards, the nearby police station learned of the incident and sent police to send him to Wujin Hospital for treatment. The bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth. According to the doctor, his life may be saved.</p>

<p>Jiaxing Commercial Bank is a limited liability company with a capital of 250,000 yuan. The shareholders include Jiang Lanxian and Gao Zhonglan, among others. It has been in operation for more than ten years. In the past, it enjoyed a good reputation in the business community. The bank also established a savings department to handle various savings accounts, attracting a significant amount of cash deposits, especially zero-deposit lump-sum payments and fixed-term savings. However, after the Ziyuan, Juyuan, and Hengyuan money shops closed on September 30, the bank was also affected by the withdrawals of depositors. On the morning of the thirteenth, it announced its closure. Before closing, it posted a public announcement stating: "This bank is temporarily suspending receipts and payments due to market influences. The bank will convene a shareholders' meeting of directors to determine further measures." However, depositors believed that savings deposits should be accounted for separately and that the bank should bear unlimited liability. Therefore, they would form a creditors' group to demand full repayment of principal and interest from the responsible parties of the bank.</p>

More than 42,000 of the 63,000 people in the county are in a state of being unable to cook without rice. The plight of the victims is unspeakable.

Now that the world economy is in decline, my country's silk industry is becoming more and more depressed. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry ordered me and others to convene leaders of the silk and silk industries to exchange opinions. The manufacturers who participated were very enthusiastic. However, there were too many opinions at that time, and the results were handed over to me for sorting out. On the silk merchants' side, they requested the organization of a unified sales agency. Their intention was very good, but whether its organization should be operated by the guild or chaired by the government has not yet been determined. Moreover, opinions are divided, and it cannot be decided in the short term. Mr. He also expressed that the current method will be tailored to the requirements of both silk and silk parties as much as possible, and both parties must strictly abide by it in order to completely solve the problem.</p>

Regarding the development of trade with Nanyang, when Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, went to Nanyang to investigate, he contacted the Dutch merchant Java Shipping Company and requested a reduction in freight rates. It is learned that the company is now in contact with the International Trade Bureau, and if goods are delivered, the freight rates can be reduced. However, the percentage of price reduction still needs to be discussed.</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Abroad Opposition to Liu Xiang Loan Association, for Juxingcheng to declare the cessation of loans from Britain, in addition to publishing written talks, also sent a letter to Juxingcheng Bank, stating: "Dear sir, I have recently read in the newspaper on the 8th that your bank's representative Liu Xiang's loan from Britain, under the serious opposition of the Chinese people, has officially declared the cessation to British merchants. Your bank's ability to rein in at the precipice and suddenly realize is sincerely gratifying to us. Even with a verbal declaration of cessation, the association believes that it is not enough to demonstrate credibility to the Chinese people. The association, as it is responsible for opposing loans, hereby proposes the following three points: (1) Issue a letter to Desai Company in the name of your bank, declaring the permanent cessation of loans. This letter must be inspected by the association. (2) Your bank should immediately recall the loan contract, convene various mass organizations and the press in Shanghai, and destroy the original loan contract in public. (3) Your bank must guarantee that there will be no similar incidents in the future. If the above points can be achieved, not only will the doubts of the Chinese people be completely dispelled, but it will also be enough to show your bank's candor. At the same time, the association will also declare its dissolution. Since your bank has been able to realize the past, there is no reason to refuse the future. Therefore, I hereby send this letter, hoping for a concrete reply."</p>

<p>City Government Distributes Relief Funds</p>
<p>Eighth Group Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, after arriving in Shanghai, the overseas Chinese expelled from Japan have been struggling to make ends meet in hotels due to unfamiliarity with the local area. They petitioned the city government for relief. The city government, finding their situation pitiable, invited representatives from the sixth group to negotiate at the central district yesterday morning. The overseas Chinese sent Wu Wentian and He Jinqian as representatives at 9:00 AM yesterday. They were received by Yuan, a clerk from the Second Division, who provided each person with a relief fund of five yuan, totaling thirty yuan for six people (note that the sixth group had ten people, four of whom have already returned to their hometowns). After receiving the money, the representatives returned to their lodgings and distributed it. According to the overseas Chinese representatives, they are deeply grateful to the mayor for providing five yuan per person. However, they have been in Shanghai for ten days, and the accumulated debt for room and board is already substantial. The money they received is insufficient to cover their debts, and they lack funds to return home. Today, representatives Zhu Wanglai and He Jinqian went to the Provincial Association to petition, but to no avail. They earnestly hope that the authorities will provide further relief to prevent them from wandering in a foreign land and starving to death. As for the ninth group of nine overseas Chinese, the Japanese ship Tsukuba Maru is scheduled to arrive at the port at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Those arriving in Shanghai this time are overseas Chinese detained by the Minamisenju Police Station in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Residents of Wuzhen Road Shantytowns Petition for Prohibition</p>
<p>The Area Was Purely Water Decades Ago</p>
<p>Residents Labored to Fill the Foundation Before They Could Settle</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the residents of the tin-skinned shantytowns in the open space between Wuzhen Road, Xinmin Road, and Xinjiang Road in Zhabei have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to stop landlords from forcing them to move. The residents of the district specially petitioned the municipal party headquarters yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation. The original text stated that the area was purely water during the Guangxu years of the Qing Dynasty. Later, it was filled by residents, and shantytowns were built sixteen years ago. At that time, Hengli Company claimed to be the owner of the property and ordered the shantytowns to pay rent ranging from one yuan to ten yuan per month. Eighteen years ago, Deshun Company came forward, prohibiting the construction of shantytowns along the road and increasing the rent to tens to hundreds of yuan per year. Twenty years ago, Decheng Company forced the residents to move, which involved a lawsuit in court. Because the landlord had no contract, it was resolved through mediation. Since then, shops and residents have signed leases, but the shantytown residents have not. Now, in the name of Yu Chang Company, they are being forced to move. They should consider the hardships of the shantytown residents who filled the foundation and restrict the forced eviction. It was decided at a meeting of the shantytown residents yesterday that they would petition the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:00 AM on the 15th to prohibit it.</p>

<p>Raw Materials and Machines Are Confiscated</p>
<p>Cars Are Judged to Be in the Custody of the Court</p>
<p>Cai Bicheng, a Sichuanese who served as a county magistrate in Sichuan, came to Shanghai with his family after becoming rich through his official position, residing at No. 24 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha, and believing that the manufacture of morphine could yield double the profits, he leased a newly built four-story mansion at Nos. 175-177 Avenue Road from Dayao Construction Company on the Museum Road, established a factory, and recruited those skilled in this technique to refine it from opium. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the Double Tenth Festival, due to careless work, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory. Cai heard the news at home and immediately fled with his wife and important documents in a car. Most of the factory employees also fled, with only three people, including Long Baochang, being captured. The trial judge of the First Special District Local Court, Liu Yugui, and the bailiff's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, went to the factory and Cai Bicheng's residence to inspect the factory on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. They deeply felt the greatness of the factory. Even compared with the morphine factory opened by the Japanese at No. 1 Huanglu Road in the past, it was still a small wizard seeing a big wizard. After the inspection was completed, Cai's family had already taken away anything of value when Cai fled, but there was still a lot of heavy furniture. The bailiff could not send personnel to guard it for a long time. After Judge Liu approved the bailiff to withdraw the guarding detectives, he immediately ordered Cai's mother-in-law, Gan Yang, to be responsible for the safekeeping. At that time, the lady stated that her son-in-law and daughter had fled this time, and she did not know when they would return, requesting that the safekeeping period be specified, otherwise the rent would not be paid when it was due, and the landlord would force them to move. Judge Liu felt that the lady's statement seemed true, so he ordered her to keep it until the end of this month, and then decide on it again when it was due. As for the four large and small machines, sixteen tanks full of morphine-soaked water, more than twenty coal stoves, and a large number of wooden boxes, glass bottles, bundles of dry and wet wool, etc. in the factory, which were either raw materials for manufacture or tools for manufacture, there were many pieces and heavy quantities, and it was impossible to move them. Since the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade, the Xinzha bailiff has been sending Chinese and foreign bailiffs to guard the area day and night in shifts to prevent theft. Yesterday morning, the bailiff, believing that the agency had been clarified by the judge's inspection and that it was not necessary to maintain the status quo for a long time, drew up a list of all the items and a car owned by Cai Bicheng that was found in the Qiu's car room on Xiejiao Road, and asked the bailiff's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, to apply to Judge Liu for disposal in court to avoid continued guarding. Judge Liu ruled that all morphine raw materials and equipment for manufacturing morphine would be confiscated, and the wool, ethyl alcohol, etc. would be handed over to the bailiff for auction, and the proceeds would be sent to the court for safekeeping. As for the car that was intercepted, it should also be temporarily stored in the court for safekeeping.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Hankou Road Shops Again Request Cancellation of One-Way Traffic <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>If the Municipal Council Only Considers the Convenience of Car Owners,</p>
<p>Then the Rights of Shops Will Be Deprived and Obligations Will No Longer Be Fulfilled</p>
<p>The shops on Hankou Road, due to the significant impact on their business since the implementation of one-way traffic on that road, previously jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting its swift cancellation. Recently, it was reported on the fifth of this month that the Municipal Council not only did not accept the shops' request, but also considered changing the one-way traffic on that road to a full-day eastward or westward direction. The shops on Hankou Road believe that this measure would be fatal to their business, and therefore sent another letter to the Municipal Council a few days ago, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the fact that our businesses have suffered a drastic decline in sales since the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road, we jointly sent a letter to your bureau on August 30th, requesting its abolition. Now, reading the report on the fifth of this month, your bureau not only does not accept our request, but even intensifies the situation by considering changing the one-way traffic to a full-day eastward or westward direction. If this proposal is implemented, it will inconvenience customers driving to purchase goods, as it was in the past. Furthermore, various vehicles that currently travel back and forth on Hankou Road four times a day will only travel twice, and those that travel back and forth twice a day will only travel once. With the reduced number of vehicle trips, the opportunity for shops to attract customers through storefront displays will also inevitably decrease. The overall business on the entire road will become even more unimaginable. Moreover, according to reports, the Director of Public Works stated at a Traffic Committee meeting that 'one-way traffic on Hankou Road is indeed more convenient for automobiles.' To prioritize the convenience of a small number of car-owning citizens, your bureau is willing to harm the business of all the shops on the road. We are all tax-paying citizens, yet the treatment we receive is so unfair. We wonder how your bureau will justify this. If you say that shops are closing down due to economic depression, consider the commercial situation on Hankou Road, which has always been known for its prosperity. Now, let's take the four parallel roads between Nanjing Road and Edward Road as an example. The number of closed and vacant shops is not as high as on Hankou Road. It is clear that one-way traffic has a significant impact on the entire road's business, and there is no room for forceful arguments. If your bureau insists on continuing to implement one-way traffic, or even takes a step further and implements the full-day eastward or westward direction, then the rights that our businesses should enjoy will be deprived, and our obligations will naturally be impossible to fulfill. We hereby make a solemn statement and request your investigation. This is addressed to the Public Concession Municipal Council, from Fuchang Gift Shop on Hankou Road and more than a hundred other businesses."</p>

<p>Guo Shouhong Bravely Fights Off Robbers</p>
<p>A Sewing Machine is Stolen</p>
<p>Fei Rongqu, from Anhui, lives in a small house at No. 1 Taoyuan Village, Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai. He works as an inspector at the Lin Sheng Military Uniform Manufacturing Factory, earning a monthly salary of twenty yuan. At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, while Fei was fast asleep, he suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door. Fei got up to inquire, and the voice claimed to be from the Public Security Bureau investigating reactionary elements. Since Fei believed they were public officials, he had no doubts and immediately opened the door. However, the visitors were not police officers. Among the five people, one was wearing a worn-out Western suit, one was wearing a silk long gown, and the rest were wearing blue and black cloth short shirts and trousers. They spoke with a northern accent and held pistols and axes. Seeing the bad situation, Fei Rongqu immediately questioned them loudly. One of them immediately swung an ax at his head. Fortunately, Fei dodged quickly and was not hit. During the struggle, Fei's brother-in-law, Guo Shouhong, came out to see what was happening. Seeing the emergency, he bravely stepped forward, grabbed the assailant around the waist, and snatched the ax. Seeing that they could not succeed, the assailants howled and fled, stealing a sewing machine before leaving. Fei and others hurriedly chased after them, but were scared back by the thugs firing two shots into the air. They then turned to the Xujiahui Branch Bureau in charge of the area to report and request pursuit.</p>

<p>Shu Zhixi, a Qingpu native residing at No. 5 Dingchang Alley, Lagenac Road, French Concession, is 25 years old this year. He used to work at Yunfei Motor Company, but has been unemployed and idle since it closed. He is fond of alcohol and cannot live without it at every meal. At noon on the 3rd of this month, Shu asked his mother, Ni (65 years old this year), for money to buy alcohol. Not getting what he wanted, he became unhappy and argued with his mother, eventually throwing a wine pot and injuring his mother's right cheek, causing swelling. His mother reported this to the French Police, who sent detectives to arrest Shu and send him to the Special No. 2 Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of injuring a close relative. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The trial was concluded by Judge Li Changnian, and yesterday morning, Judge Li presented the case in the Criminal Division One court, sentencing Shu Zhixi to six months of imprisonment for injuring his direct line mother.

<p>Victims Request the Arrest of the Arsonist Chen Yunqing</p>
<p>On the night of September 10th at 12:00 AM, a fire broke out at the Chen Rongfa Sofa Shop at No. 1350 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, resulting in the tragic death of five people, including adults and children. The news vendor Cheng Yonglin, who lived in a small room, holding his eight-year-old son Ruiqing, rushed out through the smoke. The boy was burned to death, and Cheng himself suffered severe burns. Due to the pain of losing his son and the shock, he was overstimulated and has been receiving treatment at Qu Zhifu Hospital ever since, still not out of danger. Furthermore, he is poor and cannot afford medical expenses. Chen Yunqing, the owner of the Chen Rongfa Sofa Shop where the fire started, lived on the front floor and escaped unharmed by climbing down a rope. He had insured against fire with British and American insurance companies for one thousand taels and has been hiding in the concession. The Municipal Police Bureau has repeatedly tried to arrest him without success. Now, Cheng's wife, Zhou, has learned that Chen Yunqing has arranged for someone to obtain one thousand yuan in insurance compensation, allowing him to live freely in the concession, disregarding the lives of others. She has filed a complaint with the Local Court and Public Security Bureau, accusing him of arson for compensation and causing the death of five people, requesting that Chen Yunqing be arrested and punished severely. A few days ago, the Wenmiao Police Station managed to arrest the arsonist Chen Yunqing, interrogated him briefly, and transferred him to the General Bureau for strict legal action.</p>

<p>In order to promote the implementation of the model county administration in Zhongshan County, the Zhongshan Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai established the Zhongshan County Administration Facility Promotion Association in August of this year. All proposals concerning the county's education, finance, public security, construction, and land have been adopted by the authorities. Recently, due to the mutiny in the county, County Chief Tang resigned, and the county administration was without a leader, causing panic among the people. The association immediately telegraphed the central, southwestern, and other agencies, asking them to select capable personnel to succeed him. The original telegram is copied below:</p>
<p>"To the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior, and to the West and Southwest Political Affairs Committee of Guangzhou, the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Central District Pacification Commissioner's Office:</p>
<p>Upon receiving the telegrams, we are alarmed to learn that an incident has occurred in our county and that County Chief Tang has resigned suddenly, leaving the county administration without a leader, causing panic among the people. Our association members are deeply concerned about our homeland and are extremely anxious. We believe that the county administration cannot remain vacant, and the successor should be selected by your government. We respectfully suggest that Mr. Xiao Hanzong, Mr. Zhu Zhuowen, and Mr. Chen Qingyun from our county are either pioneers of the Party or revolutionary youth, well-educated and talented, and capable of being competent. They all come from rural backgrounds and understand the hardships of the people. They have all served their homeland in the past and have gained a good reputation. To make them the forerunners of model county administration would satisfy the people's expectations. Therefore, we contribute our knowledge and respectfully request your government to consider the situation, and quickly select one of Xiao Hanzong, Zhu Zhuowen, or Chen Qingyun to succeed the county chief of Zhongshan County, to calm the people's hearts and relieve their suffering, and to demonstrate the model county administration.

<p>Pan's Mother's Plea for Release, Every Word a Tear</p>
<p>Patriotic heroes Pan Hongsheng and Liu Chongwu, and others, organized a national salvation assassination group, throwing bombs as a warning to treacherous merchants, and were arrested and sentenced to twelve years in prison by the court. Later, all sectors held a meeting to rescue them, and hired lawyer Ma Junshuo and others to file an appeal. After trial by the Second Branch of the High Court, the sentence was reduced to six years. They were immediately sent to prison for execution. Recently, Pan has been suffering from severe hemoptysis. His mother, Shi, was extremely anxious upon hearing the news at home, and complained to the Patriotic Heroes Support Association, asking the original defense lawyer Ma to submit a petition to the court, requesting that the court consider the tragic situation and grant bail for medical treatment. The wording was quite tragic and tactful. The court has now notified that bail for medical treatment has been approved. Their petition and the notification are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Pan Shi's Petition</p>
<p>"For the sake of a lung disease that is becoming increasingly dangerous, with life hanging by a thread, requesting consideration of the tragic situation, and approval of bail for medical treatment.</p>
<p>My son, Hongsheng, and Liu Chongwu, and others, because of their enthusiasm for patriotism and outrage at injustice, warned merchants who were selling Japanese goods. They asked themselves whether they had premeditated murder or selfish intentions. The police prosecuted them for suspected murder, and after repeated trials, the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial. The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, considering that they were burdened due to public affairs and that the crime was forgivable, reduced the sentence to six years. My son, in admiration of your kindness, and because various groups in this city petitioned the government for a special pardon, the Judicial Yuan instructed the Second Branch of the High Court to submit the case file after the case was confirmed, so that it could be reviewed. Therefore, my son decided to waive the right to appeal. The case was confirmed. However, my son's physical condition was weak. Since being detained, the physical and mental suffering he has endured cannot be fully described. As a result, he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis, and often coughs up blood, even filling a basin. When the retrial was held, his face was pale and he could not stand. Although he had repeatedly requested bail for medical treatment, the prison officials did not pay attention to his actual condition, and there was no sufficient medical proof. He was not approved. Later, the prison officials moved my son to the prison hospital (in Tilanqiao Prison), but because he was in a state of unfreedom and in an extraordinary environment, he could not get adequate treatment. Therefore, his lung disease worsened day by day, with no improvement. He could not eat and could not sleep at night. He could not stand for a moment, and he was exhausted after speaking a few words. Now, due to excessive coughing up blood, plus a dry cough, his face is pale and black. His life is in danger, and his death is imminent. My daughter, Huizhu, often visits the prison and knows the details best. Recently, the original defense lawyer, Ma Junshuo, reported to the prison officials, who also found that my son's condition was critical and had already moved him to the fifth floor of the hospital (the severity of the illness is directly proportional to the number of floors). They also agreed to be responsible for providing evidence when the court investigates, in order to facilitate bail for medical treatment. Based on this, my son's life is in danger, which is a most obvious fact. Moreover, my husband and I are both over sixty years old, old and frail. Our clothing and food depend on Hongsheng's labor. My husband is sick and blind, and I am also depressed and in pain. If Hongsheng dies in prison, my husband and I will surely die together. Being sentenced to imprisonment is equivalent to a death sentence, and it will inevitably affect the lives of the entire family. The tragedy of life is extreme. I respectfully ask your court to consider the circumstances of the crime and to grant temporary release for medical treatment in order to maintain life and show compassion. This is both in the public interest. Respectfully, Shanghai First Special District Court,"</p>

<p>"According to the applicant, her son Pan Hongsheng's lung disease is becoming increasingly dangerous, his life is hanging by a thread, and she requests bail for medical treatment. This court has sent a letter to the Municipal Council, asking them to order the prison to investigate and reply. The Municipal Council Prison has replied and attached a medical certificate to the court. After investigation, the prisoner is suffering from tuberculosis, and the prison doctor has certified that he should be granted bail for medical treatment. In addition to notifying the prison to investigate, we hereby notify the applicant to apply to the Municipal Council Prison for bail for medical treatment.

<p>Compensation of Three Thousand Yuan, Private Lawsuit Resolved</p>
<p>The Criminal Part is Still Under Appeal</p>
<p>Huang Naiwu, a university student from Jiangxi, harbored a grudge against Li Xiuying, a Tianjin dancer at the Da Hu Dance Hall. At around 10:00 PM on June 20th of this year, Huang invited the rascal Jiang Ada from Suzhou to bring nitrate corrosive liquid to the Da Hu Dance Hall, intending to pour it on Li's face to disfigure her and vent his anger. Unexpectedly, Jiang accidentally poured it on another dancer, Qiu Lifei, causing injuries to her face and body. The police arrested Huang and Jiang and prosecuted them in the Special No. 2 Court for the crime of injury. Huang and Jiang were each sentenced to eight months in prison. Huang disagreed and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which changed the sentence to three years in prison. The victim Qiu Lifei hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a supplementary private lawsuit, seeking damages of 48,000 yuan. The first instance judgment was transferred to the Civil Division, where Judge Wu Xiaoke summoned the parties twice. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, there was a continued hearing. The plaintiff arrived with lawyer Wu, and the defendants Huang Naiwu and Jiang Ada also separately submitted proposals from the detention center and prison. Judge Wu questioned the parties in the Seventh Tribunal and immediately advised them to reconcile, ordering the plaintiff to make concessions and instructing Huang Naiwu to increase the amount. Huang started with several hundred yuan, and finally Huang agreed to pay 3,000 yuan, which must be paid by the end of the year. With the consent of the plaintiff Qiu Lifei, a reconciliation was reached in court. The two parties signed a reconciliation record and withdrew. Huang was sent back to the detention center to await the judgment of the third instance appeal, and Jiang was sent back to the Special No. 2 Prison by the police to serve his sentence.</p>
<p>###芝巴德 Ship's Crew Bravely Rescues</p>
<p>瑞華 Ship's Crew</p>
<p>瑞華 ship caught fire, 28 crew members sent to Xiamen</p>
<p>The 芝巴德 ship, which travels to the South Seas Islands, went from Shanghai to Xiamen this time. In the waters of Fuzhou, it encountered a Chinese merchant ship that caught fire and was completely burned down and sunk. Twenty-eight crew members and sailors were fortunately rescued by the Dutch ship at the risk of their lives. Yesterday, Java Company received a detailed report from the owner of the 芝巴德 ship. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>###瑞華 Caught Fire</p>
<p>The Dutch ship荷巴德 was on its way from Shanghai to Java. On the 1st of this month, in the waters between Fuzhou and Xiamen, it encountered strong winds and huge waves. The 芝巴德 ship, while moving forward, saw a Chinese merchant ship named 瑞華 in the waters there, which was already on fire. The flames were quite intense, and the fire was already coming out of the deck. The ship had already sent out a distress signal, but no other ship was going to rescue it. At that time, the wind and waves were huge, and the people on board had no hope of escaping except to wait for death.</p>
<p>Dutch Ship to the Rescue In this hurricane and giant waves, the owner of the 芝巴德 ship, seeing this ship on fire and sending out a distress signal, did not hesitate to overcome difficulties and decided to risk great danger to sail to the rescue. At that time, the太古 Company's 济南 ship also passed by the area. After the Dutch ship requested assistance, they bravely went to rescue. However, the wind and waves were too strong, and the 芝巴德 ship could not get close. Therefore, they asked the 济南 ship to get close and stop, taking on the responsibility of blocking the wind. Then, the Dutch ship risked approaching and carried out rescue work.</p>
<p>Valiant and Commendable The owner of the 芝巴德 ship immediately gathered all the crew members and asked who dared to take this great risk, go into the burning ship to rescue people. At that time, all the crew members said they were willing to go, but the owner did not allow it, saying that this adventure was not ordinary and could not guarantee that they would not sacrifice their own lives. At that time, it was decided to choose young crew members who did not have wives and children, put the sampan into the sea, and advance through the terrifying winds and waves. After encountering nine deaths and one life, they finally reached the burning ship and rescued the crew members who were waiting for death.</p>
<p>Entire Crew Rescued A total of twenty-eight crew members and sailors were rescued from the 瑞華 ship at the risk of their lives. The people on board were all rescued. Fortunately, the assistance of the济南 ship helped the twenty-eight people to survive. They were immediately taken to the 芝巴德 ship. The crew members who went to rescue had endured all kinds of hardships. Now, all the crew members of 瑞華 have been sent to Xiamen to go ashore. The 瑞華 ship that caught fire sank into the sea a few minutes after the crew members were rescued. The cargo was completely lost. The owner of the 芝巴德 ship has telegraphed the detailed situation to the Shanghai company.</p>

<p>Demanding 5,000 Yuan from Gu Changfa, a Shipyard Owner</p>
<p>After Sending Four Letters and Changing Hotels Three Times, He Was Finally Arrested</p>
<p>Gu Changfa, a local resident, started his shipyard business in Gaomu Bridge East, Lujiazui, Pudong, making him a relatively well-off family.  A gangster coveted his wealth.  On the 19th of last month, Gu received a letter signed by Lu Jieqiu, "Minister of the Administrative Department of the Chinese Communist Party." The letter claimed the department was short of funds and had heard that Gu was quite generous, requesting his righteous assistance with a temporary loan of 5,000 yuan. If he agreed, he should place a square piece of red paper on a utility pole near the tofu shop east of Gu's residence on the main street within three days to indicate his acceptance.  After receiving the letter, Gu reported it to Li Xiaobao, the squad leader of the Pudong Public Security Bureau's detective team, while also complying with the request by,</p>

<p>On the 24th, he received another letter stating that because "Mr." (referring to Gu) was generous and would not be too demanding, he should write the amount he was willing to lend on the red paper. Gu wrote that he was willing to lend 1,000 yuan.  On the 27th, he received a third letter saying that the amount of 1,000 yuan had been approved by the department's 19th regular meeting. It instructed him to wrap the full amount in cash with paper and then with a piece of clothing, and then wrap that in newspaper. The surface should state it was to be delivered to Lu Jieqiu. He was to wait in a room at the Asia Hotel in the French Concession.  On the 3rd of this month, he received a fourth letter instructing Gu to deliver the money as agreed. If he reported it to the police, they would retaliate with,</p>
<p>Terrible measures. Gu submitted all four letters to Squad Leader Li for investigation. After examining them, Li ordered detectives Jiang Binru, Jin Yushan, Hu Ruizhi, Wang Kui, Zhao Bingquan, Chen Jinshan, Liu Enyu, etc., to disguise themselves as staff and tea servers and wait inside the Asia Hotel. Gu also booked room 425 at the hotel, preparing a large amount of ghost money to wrap as agreed, waiting for the pick up. However, the gangster had already booked a room at the</p>
<h3 id="e170">Jiangsu Hotel <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>On Guangdong Road, and ordered tea server Zhou Xiangrong to pick it up from the Asia Hotel. Zhou was apprehended by detectives. After interrogation and discovering the gangster's whereabouts, they handed Zhou the fake money to take back. The detectives followed him, but when they arrived at the Jiangsu Hotel, the gangster had already moved to room 11 at the Dazhong Hotel on Zhengjia Wood Bridge to hide. They telegraphed the Jiangsu Hotel to hold the item. At 8:15 PM, he asked Gu Longwan, a tea server from the Dazhong Hotel, to retrieve it from the Jiangsu Hotel. Again, he was caught by the detectives. After asking his intentions, they let Gu take the fake money back. The detectives continued to follow Gu until he reached the entrance of the Da Hong Lou on Fujian Road, where the gangster was waiting. Upon seeing Gu,</p>

<p>He intercepted him halfway, unwrapped the package and looked inside. He was then apprehended by Squad Leader Li and others and taken to the Lao Zha station house, and then back to the Pudong branch. After interrogation by Director Zhang, he confessed that his name was Yang Zhiqing, 27 years old, from Nanhui, and residing at 453 Lujiazui, Pudong, working as a milk deliveryman. He had previously partnered with the victim, Gu Changfa, to open a Gongda rice store and had a grudge against him. He was now under economic pressure, so he resorted to this method. He wrote all four threatening letters. Only his roommate, Wang Xiaomin, knew about it. Yesterday morning, Wang was also arrested, and the plaintiff was brought in for questioning. The judge ordered the suspect, along with the accomplice Wang Xiaomin, to be sent to the main station for further investigation last night.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Detailed Account of a Dutch Ship's Accident <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Cargo in the Middle Hold Was Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Consisting Entirely of Goods Imported into Shanghai</p>
<p>The Dutch East Asia Company's cargo ship "Zuidkerk," managed by the Java Shipping Company in Shanghai, experienced an accident en route from Europe to Shanghai, resulting in significant damage to the cargo destined for Shanghai. The situation is currently under investigation. The following is a report from yesterday.</p>
<p>Fire in the Middle Hold: The "Zuidkerk," a regular cargo ship of the Dutch Company's Europe-China route, with a displacement of 10,000 tons, was carrying a large quantity of goods from Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Shanghai. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on November 8th, at 8:00 AM on November 8th, a fire broke out in the middle hold of the ship while it was in the Suez Canal. The fire spread rapidly, engulfing all sides of the middle hold. The steel plates of the ship's hull were burned red and warped. The fire also spread to the engine room, damaging the machinery.</p>
<p>Telegram for Rescue: The Shanghai Java Company did not receive a detailed telegram from the shipowner until the 12th, stating that after the fire broke out, the entire crew worked to extinguish the fire, using five pumps to spray water. However, because the fire was in the middle hold, the water could not reach it. The shipowner then devised a plan to cut five large holes in the thick steel plates of the middle hold to allow water to enter. At that time, the shipowner sent out a distress signal. Fire boats in the canal and nearby merchant ships also came to help. After three days and nights of fire, the fire inside the ship was extinguished, but the damage was significant.</p>
<p>Cargo Loss: The cargo onboard was mostly imported to Shanghai, with the largest portion in the middle hold consisting of a large quantity of paper and cardboard. In addition, there was fake fertilizer, mostly ordered by local Chinese merchants, which was completely burned. The cargo in other holds was fortunate to be isolated, resulting in less damage. A large quantity of gunpowder in the dangerous hold (destined for Japan) was fortunately soaked in water, avoiding an explosion. The destroyed cargo has been inspected by an appraiser, and the amount of damage will be telegraphed after verification. Transshipment of Cargo: Yesterday, the company received a second telegram stating that the cargo was being unloaded at that location. Seven hundred tons of cargo and 350 tons of coal have been landed, and the rest is still being unloaded. It has been decided that the undamaged cargo destined for various ports in the East will be transshipped to Shanghai because the hull of the "Zuidkerk" requires extensive repairs and cannot sail at this time. The company has already notified the local cargo owners yesterday.</p>

<p>Trial Begins in Case Involving Student</p>
<p>Deceased's Mother Demands 99,000 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>Judge Instructs Private Suit Portion to Be Resolved Out of Court</p>
<p>On September 20th of this year, around 10:00 AM, female students Wu Yongmei, Hua Shuxian, Ouyang Shu, and Luo Qiaoyun from Jinan University in Zhenru went out to wash photos at the Yuyuan Photo Studio on the south side of the railway station. Unexpectedly, near the Jiaotong Road, about twenty steps from the school gate, a car with license plate number 3021 suddenly drove up from behind and struck three of the four female students (Luo Qiaoyun was spared). All were sent to the hospital for treatment. Wu Yongmei died upon arrival because her skull was crushed. Hua Shuxian and Ouyang Shu were hospitalized for treatment. The driver, Lan Fuming, was detained by the Third Precinct of the Fourth District and sent to the local court for questioning. Details were reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that this case has been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Zhang Zi, who ordered that Lan Fuming be released on bail of 1,600 yuan, guaranteed in writing by a shop. At the same time, Lan Fuming was prosecuted in criminal court for</p>
<h3 id="e174">Causing Death by Negligence <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Zhang Shao specially convened the Fifth Court for trial. The plaintiff, the deceased's mother Wu Kongshi, hired lawyer Su Fonan as her private lawsuit representative. The defendant, Lan Fuming, hired lawyers Wang Zaoshi and Lan Ren to defend him. Lan Fuming stated that he was 22 years old, from Guangdong, and resided at 87 Yan Hai Road, Lao Beimen. On September 20th, he was driving a car from Zhenru back to Shanghai when he accidentally caused the accident near Jinan University. The judge asked why he didn't stop the car when there were people in front of him. He replied that he did not intentionally cause the accident. The judge said that if it were intentional, he would be charged with murder. The prosecutor is now prosecuting him for causing death by negligence. If he had stopped at the time, the,</p>
<p>Tragic accident would not have happened. Lan replied that there was nothing he could do. Hua Shuxian testified that she was 22 years old, from Jiangxi, and a student at Jinan University. On that day, she and Wu Yongmei and the other two were going out to wash photos. She and Wu Yongmei were walking shoulder to shoulder, she on the left. She was knocked to the ground and fainted, and did not remember hearing the car's horn. Ouyang Shu testified that she was 20 years old, from Jiangxi. The four of them were walking in pairs, both on the left side of the road. She was behind, walking forward along the wooden posts, but the car should not have been driving fast near the school entrance, nor should it have failed to honk the horn. She was also knocked to the ground, and because there were wooden posts next to her, even if she wanted to avoid it, she could not. The judge ordered a diagram to be drawn in court and kept on file. The judge called Luo Qiaoyun to the stand, who testified that she was 21 years old, from Jiangxi, and a student at Jinan University, and corroborated the above statements. She also said that Wu Yongmei and Hua Shuxian were in front, and she</p>
<p>And Ouyang Shu were in the back, walking in two rows, about ten steps from the school, walking along the wooden posts. Unexpectedly, the car that caused the accident did not honk its horn and drove forward quickly. Ouyang Shu was immediately knocked to the ground. Because she was walking on the left side, she saw it and avoided it by going onto the sand pile on the side of the road, escaping danger. If the car had stopped at that time, Wu Yongmei would not have died tragically. Instead, it crashed straight forward, knocking down both Wu Yongmei and Hua Shuxian who were walking in front, crushing Wu Yongmei, and causing the tragedy because of the brain injury. Furthermore, the road was very wide, etc. Finally, Zhang Liancheng testified that he was a police officer in the Third Precinct of the Fourth District, stationed near Jinan University. About ten steps from his post, there were four female students walking in front and back. At that time, his (referring to the defendant's) car was driving very fast. He saw it and directed him, but he</p>
<h3 id="e175">Still Drove Fast <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Whether he was doing it on purpose or not listening to his command, he did not know. The judge asked if he was driving the car. He answered yes, but there was a woman sitting next to him. At this point, the judge asked Hua Shuxian and Ouyang Shu how much they were seeking in private compensation. They replied that they were seeking a total of 400 yuan in medical expenses and 3,000 yuan each in mental distress damages, for a total of 6,400 yuan. The plaintiff's private lawsuit lawyer stated that the private lawsuit plaintiff, Wu Kong Yude, was the mother of Wu Yongmei. Wu Yongmei was a third-year student at Jinan University in Zhenru, and she was recognized by the school authorities for her excellent character and academics. Yongmei was young and orphaned, and was the oldest in the family. The family was poor. After graduating from university, they were counting on her to support her parents and raise her younger siblings. Unexpectedly, this time, the defendant Lan Fuming drove his own car</p>
<h3 id="e176">Crashing Recklessly <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Causing Wu Yongmei to be struck and killed. Now the defendant is treating the car as a toy and human life as grass. In the criminal aspect, he should be punished. In the civil aspect, he should be strictly ordered to pay compensation. Wu Yongmei was only 23 years old. After graduating from university, she could have served society for at least 35 years. At an average of 200 yuan per month, that is 2,400 yuan per year. For 35 years, she would have earned 84,000 yuan. The educational expenses spent on Yongmei for 23 years totaled 10,000 yuan. The cost of transporting the coffin back to Jiangxi and the funeral expenses totaled 5,000 yuan. The total requested compensation is 99,000 yuan, etc. The judge ordered the defendant Lan Fuming to the stand and asked, "Now that the private lawsuit is seeking 99,000 yuan plus 6,400 yuan, how do you plan to handle it?" Lan replied, "Where would I get such a large sum? Two or three thousand yuan might be possible to raise." The judge then instructed both lawyers to resolve the private lawsuit portion out of court. The public lawsuit portion requires further investigation and will be scheduled for another joint trial. The defendant Lan Fuming was released on 5,000 yuan bail, guaranteed by a reliable shop, pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Police in Dachang Beat Villager to Death <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Public Outrage Among Villagers Leads to Protest at Police Station</p>
<p>Autopsy Completed Yesterday, Police Chief Detained Pending Investigation</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wu Zhen, the director of the Dachang Police Station of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, sent police chief Song Wentong, police officer Chen Zhongshu, and five others to catch gamblers in Miaoxiang Village and Hujiazhuang, more than five miles northeast of the town. The police encountered brothers Zhang Jianrong and Zhang Jiansheng, villagers (i.e., local security guards) from Yemaodun, pushing a small cart of cotton to sell in order to pay their grain tax in Dachang, as the deadline was approaching. Therefore, they were pushing the cart very fast. The police, suspecting that Zhang and others were rushing to report the gambling bust, ordered them to stop. Zhang and others replied that the grain tax would increase tomorrow if they did not pay it. At first, they had a slight verbal altercation, which then escalated into a physical altercation. The police were all wearing plain clothes, with their uniforms underneath, so the villagers, Zhang Jianrong, etc., did not initially know they were police officers. A fight ensued, with the officers using their pistols and handguns to beat them. Zhang and others were beaten and fell to the ground. The police chief and others, realizing they had caused trouble, fled. The villagers from the surrounding villages, hearing that the police had beaten and injured the village security guards, rushed over and carried the most severely injured Zhang Jianrong to the Dachang Police Station. About a thousand men, women, and children protested at the entrance of the police station, creating a chaotic scene. Fortunately, a local gentleman from the town intervened to mediate, and the injured man was carried back for treatment. However, his injuries were too severe, and he soon died. Yesterday, the county magistrate sent Investigator Li Shou Xuan and more than twenty armed police officers to Dachang, where the autopsy revealed that the deceased, Zhang Jianrong, had bruises on both sides of his waist and his right eye was also struck. The perpetrators, Police Chief Song Tongwen, Chen Zhongshu, etc., were taken to the county for investigation. During the autopsy, the deceased's mother, Yang (67 years old), wife, Xu (33 years old), brother-in-law, Liu Hongyuan, etc., led the deceased's thirteen-year-old son, Lin Xing, and ten-year-old daughter, Wu Mei, etc., demanding compensation. Investigator Li ordered a further investigation. The deceased was 33 years old. At the time of the beating, he also lost 16.4 yuan in cash.</p>

The first performance was a comical song, with humorous lyrics that made the audience unable to contain their laughter. After the song, the applause was thunderous, and she performed it three times in a row. Hinds, encouraged by the enthusiastic welcome of the audience, sang a portion of her signature song "Butterflies in the Rain." Her gestures and expressions were very similar to those in the movie, as if she were singing a duet with Janet Gaynor. The second performance was even more lively than the first. Her partner, Edythe Tynan, used her eloquence to please the audience, like green leaves complementing a peony flower. Her expressions and demeanor are different from ordinary singers and dancers, purely in a movie style, with unique intentions. People in Shanghai should not miss it. Other programs are also being performed as usual. The Paramount dance troupe has also updated its program. The fragrant warmth and tenderness are overwhelming.

<p>3. How to Develop National Power: Where Does the "Power" Lie? Speaking of this, everyone must be eager to ask, how exactly should national power be developed? At the same time, where exactly does the "power" lie? Speaking of developing national power, people already paid attention to it and worked hard during the reform of the Qing Dynasty. Their idea was to have strong armor and sharp weapons, and to build guns, cannons, and warships. At that time, they thought that China was extraordinary. Foreigners brought warships to China to fight us. They were threatened by gunboat diplomacy and thought that they must also use machine guns and cannons to fight back. Therefore, the method of saving the country at that time was to have strong armor and sharp weapons, which they thought was the supreme way to develop national power. However, what was the result? The result was a disastrous defeat. During the First Sino-Japanese War, China's navy was even more substantial than Japan's, but why did it still fail? This proves that the previous method of developing national power was to abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial. "National power" cannot be developed solely from the surface. The result of such development is only superficial strength. It must be cultivated from the root to have practical results. Otherwise, even if we have airplanes, cannons, and foreign guns, our Chinese soldiers will still not know how to use them. Many people are superstitious and think that bullets have eyes, and whoever is destined to die will be shot to death. Also, I often hear soldiers say, "I am a martial artist and I have no knowledge." This is really a big mistake. To be a soldier, he needs a lot of knowledge. Taking cannon firing as an example, to fire accurately, he must have extremely profound mathematical knowledge to be able to hit the target every time. In ancient times, Chinese military strategists still needed various advanced knowledge, like Zhuge Liang, who was a famous Chinese military strategist. He could predict the future, and he could win by surprise. His so-called "borrowing the east wind" is generally thought to be mysterious, but in fact it is only because his knowledge was profound, so he could apply it freely. It has been the same since ancient times, and it is even more so today. Therefore, a military strategist today needs more knowledge, and he must not say that a soldier can do without knowledge. If he has no knowledge, then he is the same as a bandit. At the same time, if we only pay attention to strong armor and sharp weapons, and do not know how to cultivate "national power" from the root and from all aspects, then that is a way of abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial.</p>
<p>"National power," if we analyze it, includes many aspects: political, economic, military, social, educational, cultural, and everything else are components of national power. Not long ago, Dagong Daily published an essay entitled "The Basic Problems of National Defense," written by Mr. Ding Wenjiang. He said that China's national defense is extremely dangerous. If a war breaks out with a foreign country, China will be full of loopholes. When the chairman introduced me just now, he complimented me on how patriotic I am and how enthusiastic I am about promoting national goods, which is actually unnecessary. We must know that we Chinese are really pitiful. It is certainly very easy to buy foreign goods in peacetime, but once a war breaks out, even if we want to buy foreign goods, there is no place to buy them. If we don't have enough to wear and use, we can do without buying them, but even the rice we eat is not enough. Our industry is so undeveloped, and as a country that claims to be based on agriculture, we have to rely on others for food. If they block your coast, you will immediately become a fish in a bucket, with no way to survive. Speaking of transportation, it is really extremely pitiful. It only takes Russia a week to get to Dihua, while it takes us three months to go from Suiyuan to Xinjiang by camel and 20 days by car. Ladies and gentlemen, please go there. Do you have the courage to go? This is not to say that the Chinese have no ambition, but because of the inconvenience of transportation. It is not easy to go to Yunnan and Guizhou either. If we want to go there, we must take a foreign ship. Once I went to Europe and met many Chinese people on the ship. I asked him, "Are you also going to a foreign country?" He said, "I am going to Yunnan." Because of the inconvenience of transportation, they have to take such a detour. But if the French want to go, they can get there in a day or two. From this, we can see how dangerous our national defense is. Once the border is in emergency, enemy troops will arrive in the morning and reach the evening, but we are too far away to help. Therefore, speaking of China's national defense, the problem is not simple. We must start from many aspects, and at the same time, economic, social, and various undertakings must be developed to make national defense practical. In other words, we must first have national power before we can have national defense. However, how exactly do we develop our national power, and who will develop it? The reason why I advocate "self-reliance" is that it is the most practical way to strengthen national power. Self-reliance is the engine of strengthening national power, because to talk about self-reliance, we must first set an example. At least I must work hard to talk about self-reliance. Today, I encourage everyone, if we want to develop national power, we must start with each of us. As long as I bury my head and work hard, the result of hard work, little by little, bit by bit, is national power. National power comes from the hard work of the people. We don't have to look for national power elsewhere. Now, many people give up on themselves and think that the Chinese are really doomed to die, and that the Chinese are the most unpromising in the world. Therefore, everyone is unwilling to work hard. This is really suicide. We must be aware and correct this suicide, and believe that as long as we work hard, we will have national power. If we want to develop national power, we must promote self-reliance. "National power is contained in everyone, in my brain, in my hands. The power of each person is a component of national power. The sum of the separate and joint efforts of 400 million people is equal to the power of the nation. After the power of the nation is there, the country will naturally be strong, there is no problem. Is there any country in the world that has more great people than we Chinese, and is there any country with more people than us? There are 400 million and one people. The country is the accumulation of people. In the principles of political science, people are the essential element of the country. So as long as we all work hard, the result of hard work added together, this power is truly unparalleled. It can break the world record, overcome any national disaster, and defeat any powerful enemy. As long as the six families adhere to this principle, the result will be to develop national power.</p>

Shandong martial arts athletes Huo Tonglin and Hu Huanbin performed special skills this afternoon. Both of them were skilled in Qigong.

<h3 id="e204">Donghua Wins Opening Game, Defeats Xibu 5-2 <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Takes a 3-0 Lead in the First Half</p>
<p>Draws 2-2 in the Second Half</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second Sino-Western match since the opening of the Western League. The audience was shocked by the reputations of the Donghua and Xibu teams, and no fewer than 6,000 people went to watch. The Xibu team was far less brave and powerful than in the past. Their movements were slow, and their connection was also rigid and scattered. Although Yat Xu was heroic, his age was getting old, and his strength was not enough. Sometimes, he simply sighed at the ball. The first half ended with a score of 3-0. In the last quarter of an hour of the second half, they tried their best to counterattack, but they only scored two goals each. The result was a score of 5-2, with Xibu suffering a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>When center Dai Zhongfeng opened the scoring record, the golden bell reported three times. Xibu began to come slowly. The referee ordered the two armies to arrange their formations. Donghua kicked off not far away, and Yat Xu was invited to stop him. After a dozen rounds, Feng Yunyou rose up as a surprise soldier, took the ball into the enemy's formation, and transferred the ball to his home. Farlas Tao Ran came to grab it, and Jiaqiu was clever and took advantage of the situation to secretly hand it over to Lin Jing. He rode alone and flew to the doorstep, and shot fiercely at his feet. He fell into the net in response.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Cao Qiuting's Surprise Soldiers from Xieguzhong <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Under the watchful eyes of thousands of people, the spirit of Donghua was greatly boosted, the iron cavalry was rampant, and the artillery was as rainy. Yat Xu mobilized his troops to defend and fought like trapped beasts. After a stalemate for five minutes, Jia Youliang rebelled on the frontier, killed the low line, and returned to the pass. Li Yichen was unusually cunning, bowing like this, letting the ball pass, and stabbing to see Cao Qiuting, a branch of the army descended from the sky, pulling up a leg, flat and rapid, Platley was caught off guard, and scurried into the net, clear, beautiful, and unwatchable.</p>
<p>Dai Lin Jing's Success on Top Once Again After that, the battlefield belonged to Donghua's world. Jia Youliang revisited his old place, and Cao Qiuting greeted him from the top. Fortunately, the enemy guard desperately patted it out, so that he could avoid it. Blayjack's disciples saw that they had lost two balls in an instant, and they all felt fire in their eyes and launched a major counterattack. Generals Li and Gu were as stable as rocks and as safe as Mount Tai. The door to the mainland was empty. Jia Youliang peeked for the third time and passed it into the dangerous area. Cao Qiuting topped to the right, and A Dai had been waiting for a long time, and entered the door by receiving the top, forming a score of three to zero, ending the first half.</p>
<p>The Injury of the Great General Gained One But Lost Two After a short break, the war started again. After Donghua adjusted its defense, its momentum did not weaken slightly. After the kick-off, Zeng Wuyi took the time, Feng Yunyou continued to transport military fire, Li Yichen took big steps and jumped out of the crowd, just a few feet away from the door, and he was about to succeed again. In no time, Xiao Jia passed the low ball, crossed the door, and Li Yichen fought the bar with his body, but he was one step too late to succeed. Kleford Farlas killed him so dizzy that he killed each other, causing laughter from the audience. Dr. Tu was too hasty in operating, and his feet were injured and he could not fight, so he resigned. After Chen Jiaqiu was transferred back to his original defense, Xibu took advantage of the fire to rob him, and Yat Xu transmitted the ball to Huailai from afar, invading Donghua's restricted area. The mainland regretted that he should not have left his old lair lightly, so Huailai began to succeed. Before long, the five front lines of the capture team came to harass again. Li Ning topped it out not far away, and Yat Xu shot hard to make the score two to four.</p>
<p>Twelve Codes A Dai Establishes the Country At this time, Xibu had a sign of coming back to life, and thousands of spectators were worried about Donghua. However, Donghua was not comparable to the weak, and although it fought with ten men, it still had the ability to attack tirelessly. Jia Youliang met and shot, and was thrown out by Platley. Li Yichen circled slightly and shot a shot. Farlas was hit by a stray bullet, and the kiss ball was ruled to be punished by twelve yards. With the central striker taking the penalty, there was no mistake. The number five to two was completed, and Donghua rejoiced and triumphed.</p>

<p>Lin Baohua Loses to Carlson</p>
<p>Bitter Fight Five Sets Difficult to Separate Determination</p>
<p>Equal Situation Baohua Loses Due to Inferior Strength</p>
<p>The China Tennis Club Open Singles Championship held its replay of the first and second rounds yesterday. The battle between Carlson and Lin Baohua in the first round was particularly concerned by tennis enthusiasts. Because Carlson has won two battles against Qiu Feihai, but has never met Lin Baohua, the two have the same hitting method, and the outcome is uncertain. Yesterday's result was that Lin Baohua finally lost due to his inferior strength after five sets of fierce fighting, which is a pity. The tension of the air and the equality of the situation are both between victory and defeat. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Carlson Three to Six Seven to Five Six to Eight Six to Zero Thirteen to Eleven Lin Baohua</p>
<h3 id="e207">Not Many Highlights <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The two started at half past two and ended at half past five, playing for more than three hours in total. However, there were only a few highlights among them. The two were each wary and too careful in combat, so they could not swing their swords and do what they wanted. Both of them were good at working in front of the net, but the number of times they went to the net was very small, and they used the bottom line to draw more. Taking the long and taking the short, the highlights were lost. Carlson's daily split kill was rarely seen, and there were many mistakes. After entering, the serve gradually improved, and he went to the net several times, but he did not dare to try after failing repeatedly. He retreated to the bottom line to seek victory.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Inferior Strength <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Baohua's failure was not due to the difference in technology, but to the fact that his strength was inferior to Carlson's. In the last two sets, Baohua's exhaustion was very obvious. It was not easy to support the fifth set to thirteen to eleven. Yesterday, Lin's draw and the mid-air ball in the first half of the net were better than Carlson's. The serve seemed to be inferior. Carlson did not dare to try the high ball because of his height. Some split kills and deep draws from the bottom corner made Carlson at a loss. It is a pity that the field is a hard court, and both sides felt the pain of slipping and not being able to take foot. The failure to place a line of sight members throughout the court makes people question whether the ball touches the line many times out of bounds, whether it is out of bounds.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Baohua Has the Advantage <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua kicked off and was won by Ka, but Lin won two games in a row, taking the lead with two to one. His forehand drew deeply and hit Carlson's right corner fiercely, trying repeatedly and effectively, but Ka also won two games, and Lin won two games again, becoming four to three. Carlson's serve failed, and Lin won three games in a row, chasing it to five to five, and then worked hard to whip it up, and unexpectedly won with eight to six, which was unexpected. Lin has an advantage of two to one.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Ultimately Failed <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Bao Hua's gradual decline in physical strength was evident, but after taking a two-to-one lead, it was unexpected that he would lose two sets and be defeated. After a break, Carlsen's vigor surged in the fourth set, winning six consecutive games for an easy victory. In the third game of the fifth set, Lin's serve repeatedly hit the net three times, accumulating errors. Carlsen then took a four-to-one lead, and later made it five to three. Carlsen's serve failed (Lin saved it, tying it at five-to-five). Then Carlsen took the lead by one game each time, and Lin equalized. At eight-eight and nine-nine, Lin then failed his serve, and Carlsen won at thirteen to eleven. At eight to seven and nine to eight, Lin had twice saved it from fifteen-forty to win, but in the end, he still lost. It was a pity.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Zhejiang Department of Education Orders Promulgation of Austerity Measures for Educational Expenses in Various Counties <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Five Measures in Three Steps</p>
<p>(Hangzhou News) Zhejiang Province has suffered from drought this year, greatly affecting the income of educational expenses in various counties. Without strenuous efforts to tighten up various expenditures of county educational expenses this year, educational undertakings are likely to be brought to a standstill. In view of this, the Department of Education has carefully considered the importance and urgency of various educational undertakings in various counties and has drafted austerity measures for educational expenses in various counties for the 23rd year of the Republic. The basis for each county's austerity measures has already been distributed to various counties to handle according to the actual situation. The measures are excerpted below: (1) If the income of county educational expenses in the 23rd year is insufficient, the county should first try to maintain it. If it is impossible to list expenditures according to the original budget, it may be tightened in accordance with these measures. (2) The order of tightening up county educational expenses should proceed in the following three steps: A. First step austerity measures: include educational observation groups, trips to the province for meetings, investigation fees for vocational teachers, elementary education and folk education achievement exhibitions, children's activity gatherings, literacy campaigns, sports meets, etc. The originally listed expenses should be completely eliminated. B. Second step cumulative austerity measures: Educational institutions with few students and poor performance should merge classes or merge with nearby educational institutions of equivalent nature. The originally listed expenses should be completely eliminated or partially reduced. C. Third step austerity measures: Educational expenses for various educational institutions should be discounted and issued. The discount percentage, in addition to educational administrative agencies, should try to tighten their proportion as much as possible, with a larger percentage of 5% to 10% as the standard. Other institutions should follow a uniform principle. (3) If the county's educational expenses have been approved for reduction and austerity prior to the promulgation of these measures, they may still be handled as originally approved. (4) Counties with a smaller degree of educational expense shortfall should consider tightening the various expenses listed in the first step according to the actual situation of the county. (5) The austerity budget for county educational expenses should be submitted to the County Education and Education Committee for review and approval, and then submitted to the Department of Education for approval and implementation. These measures will be implemented after being announced by the Department of Education.</p>

<p>First, Director Pan gave a report, stating that the purpose of convening the principals of municipal middle schools and municipal elementary schools in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts today is to solicit opinions from various schools on guiding students in further education and careers. The Shanghai Municipality's Measures for Guidance on Further Education and Careers for Elementary and Middle School Students have already been promulgated. Middle schools, starting from the second grade, and elementary schools, starting from the fifth grade, should all implement guidance on further education and careers in accordance with these measures. In addition to the establishment of a municipal committee for guidance on further education and careers by the Bureau of Education, each school should also have an organizational structure for the implementation of a committee for guidance on further education and careers. The number of committee members should be increased or decreased by each school depending on the circumstances, and the principal should be designated as a standing committee member. Each school already has this organization starting from this semester. At the second meeting of the Bureau of Education's committee for guidance on further education and careers, it was resolved that starting from the 13th academic year, the Bureau of Education would convene principals from various schools to solicit opinions in order to consider the actual situation and urge various schools to earnestly implement matters related to guidance on further education and careers for students within their schools. This is the purpose of today's meeting, and it is hoped that everyone will put forward any opinions they have as much as possible. Next, Section Chief Zeng briefly reported.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Schools' Opinions <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Then, the principals of various schools successively reported on the implementation of guidance on further education and careers in their respective schools and expressed their opinions. The points are summarized as follows: (1) The curriculum of various elementary schools is often unable to connect, causing difficulties for elementary school graduates when taking middle school entrance examinations. Remedial measures should be sought. (2) Curriculum standards are not uniform, causing students to encounter difficulties in further education and examinations due to the different textbooks used by various schools. (3) The Bureau of Education should liaise with the industrial sector to have an organization for registration and job placement to facilitate the employment of students from various schools. The above points were handed over to the municipal committee for guidance on further education and careers for discussion. Finally, Director Pan gave instructions based on the reports of various schools, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e223">The Most Difficult Subject <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Si</p>
<p>Children, if someone asks you, "What is the most difficult subject?" I think you will definitely answer without hesitation, "It is arithmetic." Indeed, arithmetic is a subject that cannot be recited like Chinese, nor is it as easy to remember as general knowledge, so it often causes many children to be unable to solve problems, be punished by teachers, and develop a fear of arithmetic.</p>
<p>However, is arithmetic really the most difficult subject? This is probably not necessarily the case. If you approach arithmetic problems with an indomitable spirit, and if you can't solve it once, try again; if you can't solve it twice, keep trying. As long as you are a diligent child, no matter how difficult the problem is, you will eventually solve it, and the satisfaction of solving it with your own mind will bring you extra benefits and make you feel interested.</p>
<p>Arithmetic can be said to be the most important subject. All scientific inventions can be said to be based on arithmetic, so it has a great relationship to the strength or weakness of a country. Children, look! Our country is so weak, let's work hard on this most difficult subject.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Who Invented the Four Stationery Items? <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ku</p>
<p>Children, who invented the pens, ink, paper, and inkstones that we use every day for writing? I'm afraid many students don't know the answer to this question. Let me tell you now:</p>
<p>Ink in our country was invented by Xing Yi of the Zhou Dynasty. Whether the ink at that time was graphite or glue ink is no longer possible to investigate, but pine soot ink only appeared in the Wei and Jin Dynasties, so the ink invented by Xing Yi was definitely not pine soot ink, which can be deduced. In addition, there are the inventors of the three items pen, paper and inkstone: one is Zhong You, a student of Confucius, who invented the stone inkstone; one is Meng Tian, a general during the Qin Dynasty, who invented the writing brush; and one is Cai Lun, a eunuch during the Eastern Han Dynasty, who invented paper.</p>
<p>Since they invented the stationery of our country, pen, ink, paper, and inkstone, it has become very convenient to write. At the same time, writing has gradually spread. We should thank them for their contributions to invention!</p>
<h3 id="e225">Tofu and Vegetables <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>When you children come to the dining table and see it full of chicken, duck, fish, and meat, you must be overjoyed. Those of you who are used to eating a bowl of rice with every meal will definitely want to add half a bowl or even a whole bowl. This truly embodies the idioms "wolfing down food" and "striving to eat more." But if today you see only tofu and vegetables on the table, you will definitely frown and lose your appetite. Naughty children will even cry and fuss with their parents. Children, do you usually have these habits?</p>
<p>Tofu and vegetables, you really shouldn't underestimate them. Their effects are actually better than those of fish and meat. This is because fish and meat only contain fats, which do not provide much nourishment for people. Moreover, sometimes they carry parasites, and eating them can cause illness. As for tofu, it is made from soybeans and contains abundant "vitamins," which are clean and nourishing. This has been generally recognized by people all over the world. The effects of vegetables are even greater. They also contain "vitamins." The "chlorophyll" in the leaves can also purify the blood and aid digestion. As long as they are cooked properly, the taste is no worse than fish and meat. Therefore, I advise you children to eat more vegetables and tofu every day.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Look Carefully <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>Children, look carefully!</p>
<p>Which road is life?</p>
<p>Which road is death?</p>
<p>Work hard!</p>
<p>Look carefully at the broad road you should take,</p>

<p>Children! Look carefully!</p>
<p>Don't buy foreign goods,</p>
<p>Then you are a good child!</p>
<p>Look carefully at the enemies of your country,</p>
<p>And don't fear them even if they have three heads and six arms!</p>
<p>Children, look carefully!</p>
<p>Look carefully at your path,</p>
<p>Work hard!</p>
<p>Working hard to prepare to wipe away the national shame in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e227">The Relationship Between Expansion and Pressure <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jiexin</p>
<p>Children, before you play with this experiment, you need to prepare a rice bowl, a teacup, a box of matches, and a piece of white paper -- about three and a half inches square.</p>
<p>First, pour a cup of water into the bowl, then crumple the paper into a ball, light it, and put it into the cup (note -- the cup should be dry). When it is about to burn out, immediately turn the cup upside down into the bowl. This way, you can see the water in the bowl gradually decreasing!</p>
<p>Children, think about it, what is the reason for this? The reason is very simple. When the burning paper is put into the bowl, the air in the cup expands due to heat and rises, and the pressure decreases. At that time, the inside of the cup can be considered a vacuum. When it is turned upside down in the bowl, because the air pressure outside is greater than the pressure inside the cup, it immediately forces the water into the cup!</p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at the following conclusion: The greater the expansion, the greater the decrease in pressure.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Common Knowledge of Raising Singing Insects <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>In autumn, there are many singing insects in front of the steps and among the flowers. Crickets, katydids, gold crickets, and "Guo Guo Er" all have very pleasant singing voices, and children all like to keep them in cages.</p>
<p>Swallows come in the spring; geese leave in the spring: these are called "migratory birds." Insects chirp and sing in the autumn, so they are also called "migratory insects." This is also a characteristic of animals.</p>
<p>Crickets are naturally brave and like to fight. The winner often flaps its wings and sings. Children often like to keep them in bamboo cages to watch them fight. When I was young, I kept crickets in earthenware jars. I made several holes in the mud inside the jar for the crickets to live in, like the cave-dwelling life of ancient times. With this method of raising them, crickets could often be kept until winter. "Ji Ling," "Ji Ling," admiring their singing.</p>
<p>Katydids are also known as "spinning girls" because their chirping sounds like spinning. They live among flowers and plants, are small and green, and chirp loudly. Sitting in the autumn courtyard at night, it sounds like a sudden gust of wind and heavy rain. Children only need to lure them from a distance with a lamp, and they will definitely fly over, making it easy to catch them. Just feed them pumpkin flowers and red water chestnut meat, and they will be able to live and sing to you at night.</p>
<p>"Guo Guo Er," also called "Call Brother," is an autumn insect produced in the corn, millet, and millet plants in the Jiangbei region. They are caught and kept in cages made of fine bamboo strips and sold in the streets, making it easy for children to buy them. "Call Brother" chirps and sings all day long, which is annoying. Crickets and gold crickets are better because they are quiet and pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>Gold crickets are small and golden, and they are a petite and exquisite autumn insect. But its chirping is very loud. They live in clumps of bamboo and shrubs. We put a bamboo basket below and use a wooden stick to beat the clumps of bamboo and shrubs. The gold crickets will fall into the basket, and we can catch them. The cage for raising gold crickets can be made of glass; or it can be made in the style of a clock, or in the style of a pagoda -- octagonal, rectangular, or round -- all of which can be made by oneself. This is also a child's craft. When I was young, I really liked making them myself. Gold crickets only eat some rice grains, and they don't need much food. If they are raised properly, they can still live through the winter, but the chirping will be very faint. At this time, they should be kept in a warm room with cotton wadding inside the cage so that they won't freeze to death. I remember one year, when the weather was already cold, I was afraid that they would freeze to death, so I exposed them to the sun. Who knew that the time was too long, and they all died in the sun. Because they were trapped in the cage, they couldn't escape, and they all died. "Loving them ended up harming them." Children! There are many such things!</p>
<h3 id="e229">Fairy Tale <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Ms. Qin Qianpei</p>
<p>(1) Naughty three brothers, playing by the river, saw something swimming in the river. They had never seen it before, so they thought it must be a monster, and threw stones at it. (2) The monster cried out in panic, and they laughed and prepared to leave. (3) The monster stood up heroically, and they were so frightened that they ran for their lives.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Two Scientific Toys <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>

<p>The parachute used on airplanes is an extremely fashionable and scientific toy that can be experimented with.</p>
<p>Children, in your spare time, you may wish to try making one. If there are many people, you can hold a competition to see who flies higher or lower, which will add to the fun.</p>
<p>First, make an arrow shaft out of wood, then take a larger handkerchief, and tie the four corners to the arrow shaft with thread. However, the lines should be longer, and the length of each line should be the same to avoid tilting when landing.</p>
<p>Take another wooden strip and tie a rope to it. Tie a knot at the end of the rope to make a launcher. When launching, hook the knot of the rope into the pre-cut notch on the arrow shaft. Hold the arrow shaft with your left hand and the launcher with your right hand. Swing the launcher into the air with your right hand, and immediately release the arrow shaft with your left hand. The parachute will fly into the air (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Lightweight Clock: Take a larger wooden box, and drill a round "匚" hole on each of the left and right sides. Draw the hour markings on one side (Figure 2). Then take a wooden rod that fits the size of the round hole to assemble the hour hand. Place an empty thread spool between the two round holes. Place a thin hemp thread on the spool. Tie a piece of tinplate to one end and a piece of "Wen" wood to the other end. (The weight of the tinplate and the wood should be equal.) Use an empty cigarette can below, drill a small "匚" hole, fill it with water, and float the wood on the surface of the water (Figure 2). Assemble it, and put the cigarette can on another can to hold water. It can be used.</p>
<p>Because the water in the "云" tube drips down from the "一" hole, the wood lowers along with the surface of the water, pulling the round shaft, and the needle on the outside rotates at the same time (Figure 3).</p>
<h3 id="e231">Brush <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>

<p>A brush is something made of pig bristles and cattle bones, and it is used to remove dirt. If there were no such thing in the world, people would feel uncomfortable and unclean. Uncleanliness would affect people's health, and the unsound bodies of the people would cause society, the country, and even the world to lack spirit and vitality. Therefore, although a brush is a small thing, it has such great importance to people.</p>
<p>Since brushes are so useful, is there not a large brush that can remove the uncleanliness of the country and wash away the national shame? Yes, the large brush for washing away national shame is not something made of pig bristles and cattle bones. It is naturally created, and it is the pair of hands and a brain that each of us has.</p>
<p>Compatriots! Quickly rise up! Use our naturally created large brushes, our brains and hands, to wash away our country's extraordinary shame!</p>

<p>(I) The children of the Native Americans have completely different ways of playing games than we do. They often play archery, and they are very good at it, so good you could say they hit the bullseye every time. Because they make a living by hunting and fishing, they must practice the skills necessary for life in childhood.</p>
<p>(II) Swiss children often carry a stick, a knapsack, and wear shoes with spiked soles when they go out to play. The stick and shoes help them climb mountains or cross water, and the knapsack contains raincoats and shirts for rain and changes in the weather. This is also to adapt to the climate and environment.</p>
<p>(III) In Philippine schools, most of their buildings are made of palm trees and bamboo. The students there have very short hair that stands straight up like bristles. They also wear the bottom half of their shirts outside their pants, and wear slippers on their feet, which is not very attractive.</p>
<p>(IV) Dutch children mostly wear wooden shoes. We find them clumsy and heavy, but in the Netherlands, where the land is low and there is a lot of water, wearing these shoes is most suitable.</p>

<p>Old-fashioned song lyrics are being phased out with the evolution of the times, like; Eighteen Touches, Rowing a Boat on the Lake, and the like. The newly popular song lyrics are surging like the tides, like; Peach Blossom River is a Beauty's Nest, Lullaby, and the like. Many young girls are frantically learning to sing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huang across the street has been working hard to teach three young girls to sing. My house and her house face each other, and my long window happens to face her hexagonal window opening. Every morning, or when it is quiet in the evening, Mrs. Huang uses a very clumsy method to teach singing. She bought a record player, first copied down the lyrics on the record, had them read them until they were familiar, and then told them to sing along with the record player. But people's aptitude varies between clever and stupid. Mrs. Huang doesn't care, she only knows to whip them with a leather whip if they can't sing, beating them while constantly saying; "Dumb fool! Stupid thing!" with loud shouts and beatings.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the early morning or late at night, I am always awakened by the crying and shouting. I open the window to look and can still see streaks of purple marks under the light of the sixteen electric lamps. I also hear Mrs. Huang saying that she is doing it for their own good, that she is beating them so they can become famous! After several days of investigation, I learned that these three girls are not Mrs. Huang's own daughters, so no wonder she can use such vicious methods every day, and it is really not easy for Chinese singers to become famous!</p>
<h3 id="e234">How the Moon Was Formed <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The moon that we see every night gradually becomes full from the first night to the fifteenth night of the lunar calendar, and then gradually wanes from the sixteenth night to the thirtieth night, in an endless cycle throughout the year. But how was this moon formed? It is really strange and incredible. Now I will tell you one theory of how it was formed; A scholar said that tens of millions of years ago, a part of the Earth we live on separated from the Earth and became the Moon. However, is this theory ultimately reliable? We cannot be sure, but when we investigate the shape of the Earth tens of millions of years ago, it was not like it is now, with land, sea, and animals and plants, but a chaotic, huge mass of gas. Therefore, famous scientists such as George Darwin and Henri Poincaré of France, from the standpoint of mathematics, studied the Earth in the era of this gas mass and obtained an equation for how it became the Moon. That is to say, in the era of the gas mass, the Earth had a very fast base spinning force, and as a result of the spinning, its shape became elliptical (oval). Later, the gas mass gradually cooled and became a large mass of liquid (that is, a part of the Earth, because of the spinning and vibration, a small mass occurred. This small mass gradually grew like a tumor, and later, under the influence of centrifugal force and solar force fluctuations, it suddenly separated from the large mass and existed independently in the air. This is the reason for the birth of the Moon. The volume of this moon is 5,000 cubic miles. According to the research of astronomers, the place where the Moon separated from the Earth is the mark of the separation of the small mass and the large mass, which is on the Pacific side. However, this theory was overturned by Dr. Archenhold, because according to Dr. Archenhold's opinion, he said: If we simply calculate, the volume of the seabed of the Pacific Ocean is less than one-thirtieth of the volume of the Moon. Even if we gather the world's three major oceans, the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, they are not as large as the Moon. In the end, the theory that the Moon was separated from the Earth is established, but its traces must not be on the Pacific side. According to astronomical calculations and investigations, the average distance from the Earth to the Moon is 384,400 kilometers. To travel to the Moon once, at the current rate of regular air travel, calculated by passenger planes traveling 150 kilometers per hour, it would take 107 days to reach the Moon. If calculated by the special express train of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, it would take more than 250 or 60 days. As for how big the Moon is, according to detailed investigations by astronomers, it is one-fiftieth of the Earth, with a diameter of 3,476 kilometers. On the Moon, half of each month is daytime and half is nighttime, unlike the Earth, which has an atmosphere and a hydrosphere, so the temperature changes on the Moon are very drastic. During the day, it receives heat from the sun, and at night, the heat it receives from the sun completely disappears. That is, the temperature can be over a hundred degrees Celsius during the day, reaching as high as 180 degrees during the full moon, and suddenly dropping to hundreds of degrees below zero at night. The dark, low-lying areas will also drop to 180 degrees below zero, so no living things can survive. In terms of the brightness of the moon; there are 4 billion lights, the most terrible thing is that there are craters of dead volcanoes everywhere, all desolate, with some things left behind. In recent years, astronomers and explorers from various countries have often thought about traveling to the Moon, but because of the long distance, the rapid changes in temperature, and the air conditions, they dare not take the risk. If the Moon's surroundings also develop a hydrosphere and atmosphere in the future, then life can occur. Judging from this, the saying in our country's legend that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang traveled to the Moon Palace is completely absurd and unfounded.</p>

<p>Transfer Date Approaching, Buying Interest Recovering</p>
<p>Gold Price Rises Eight Yuan One</p>
<p>Situation in the Middle of the Day Extremely Chaotic</p>
<p>Rumors Abound, Short Sellers Rush to Cover</p>
<p>Since the astonishing changes in the gold market in the previous dynasty, the market yesterday formed a chaotic situation. Those in the industry still feel pressured. The advance and retreat of market prices seem to be beyond the ordinary and without any standard, entirely dependent on how the sentiment of the people moves. The buying intentions of large households are still strong, rumors are flying, and short sellers continue to cover. As a result, the market rebounded. There were many ups and downs in the middle of the day, and speculative buying was still thriving. In the early morning, the market was lower than the previous day's closing price, retreating to 901 yuan, because the U.S. market was closed, the London silver market shrunk very little, and the London gold price fell by two pence, so the exchange rate rose. The Associated Press reported that the U.S. government's reply to China's protest against the silver policy has been agreed upon and will be published simultaneously with its contents. However, the U.S. government's silver purchase policy is reportedly going to continue. In addition, speculators in the London silver market have stated that the U.S. government's continued silver purchase is beyond doubt. The market expected the price to be lower than the previous day's closing price, retreating to 901 yuan. However, because those in the industry still find it difficult to settle their minds, the general opinion is that the overseas silver market will be unaffected. If the silver price does rise, then the rumors may be true; otherwise, the government will definitely find a way to stop it. Therefore, seeing the price drop, buying interest revived. In a flash, the price rose to 11 or 12 yuan, and then fell again. The situation was extremely chaotic. After the opening, large households continued to buy, pushing the price out of the 10 yuan range again. After entering the market, the exchange market tightened and then gradually eased. The gold price also gradually declined. However, because giant short sellers such as Sen Changyong were mostly covering their positions, the price rebounded. When the exchange market became firmer, the central bank fiercely suppressed the near-term U.S. dollar, and hedging supply was strong, sentiment softened briefly, and the price fell. However, buyers were unwilling to give in, and after the price fell, they became active again. Short sellers continued to cover, and the market remained stable. In these troubled times, rumors unfavorable to sellers were frequently spread. In addition, because of the holiday, sellers were trembling, fearing that they would repeat their mistakes. At noon, buying interest was strong again, and the price rose out of the 10 yuan range. However, the market remained calm in the afternoon. It is difficult to be certain about the market situation in the middle of the day. The rise in prices was due to the terrifying rumors, but the November transfer date (Monday) is approaching, and the number of chips is still crowded. The gestures of a certain large household seem to be knocking on the large discount price, which also contributed to the buying interest. Now, the market situation in the middle of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 907 yuan 7 jiao, up 7 yuan 4 jiao from the previous closing. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices, British exchange at 1 shilling 6 pence 1875, U.S. exchange at 37 yuan 375. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Dafa, Yongqian, Changxiang, Fuxing, Yongding, Kangyuan, etc. gradually bought in from 6 yuan 7 jiao, rising to 11 yuan 5 jiao. Sumitomo, Wahbi, and Zheng Corporation sold January U.S. dollars at 3125, Shengda, Qingyu, Fuxing, Yongyu, Qingyong, Hongxing successively sold, retreating to 06 yuan 5 jiao. Dalian gang and Yicheng still came in, and the price rose again to 9 yuan. At this time, it was learned that HSBC's listed British exchange was reduced by 25 and U.S. exchange by half a yuan, and the sentiment was uncertain. HSBC filled December U.S. dollars at 25, and Yuqing, Yongfuxing, Yongyuanfeng, and Yong took the opportunity to get out, retreating to 6 yuan 5 jiao. Although Hengyu, Fuyu, Fuan, and Sen Changyong came in, they were frustrated because Yuqingyong and Hengxing came to sell, retreating to 5 yuan. After Sen Changyong, Yongli, Yifeng, Yongzhentai, Futai, Hengfuan, Yicheng, and Qianxiang entered, the price rose to 9 yuan. Although Hengyu and Dadecheng sold within 8 yuan, the price rose again to 9 yuan 5 jiao because Sen Changyong, Yuanmao, and Yong still came in aggressively. After entering the market, the exchange market was still loose, and Shanghai came out with January U.S. dollars at 375 and the price fell. Fuchang, Shengda, Yuanyi, Dadecheng, Zhengchang, Hongli, Yuqingyong, Qingyuanmao, Yong etc. continuously sold their positions. The Associated Press also reported that the U.S. President has the power to dispose of and reduce the fineness of silver dollars, and the sentiment gradually turned weak. Retail investors pressed down, and Mitsui filled October U.S. dollars at 375, so the price fell to 3 yuan 1 jiao. There was a lot of struggle in the middle, and Hengyu, Qianxiang, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Chunyuan Yong, Sen Changyong, etc. took the opportunity to buy in at low prices, gradually rising to 5 yuan 5 jiao. Yongli and Tianfeng sold their positions, retreating to 4 yuan. However, the buyers continued to be active, and Sen Changyong, Hengyu, and Fuxingyong etc. advanced to 8 yuan 3 jiao. Fuyu, Hongxing, Richang, Hengyu, and Yuqingyong slightly came to sell, dropping to 5 yuan 1 jiao. Dadecheng, Qianxiang, and Yuanmaoyong still bought in, rising to 7 yuan 2 jiao. Fuyu and Yuqingyong came to sell, and the price retreated to 5 yuan 1 jiao again, but the overall trend was difficult to reverse, and the sentiment was panicked. After a while, rumors arose again, and Qingyu, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Qianxiang, Shunmao, Fuxingyong, Shenkang, etc. bought together. Sellers did not dare to be active, and at noon the price rose out of the 10 yuan range again, rising to 05 jiao. Hongxing, Ruikang, Qingyu, and Fuan etc. came up to sell, and the price immediately went downstream. The noon closing was 908 yuan 4 jiao. After the closing, Tongchun etc. slightly sold, and the price was slightly clumsy. Fuxingyong etc. came in again, and the price rose to around 9 yuan. Finally, it presented a calm state. The highest price in the middle of the day was 911 yuan 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 903 yuan 1 jiao, a total of 8 yuan 4 jiao of ups and downs. As a result, the price rebounded 8 yuan 1 jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>

At noon, it also closed at 908 yuan 4 jiao, up 8 yuan 1 jiao from the previous closing. The number of chips increased significantly. The multi-party count Fuchang has more than 5,000 as the most, and the short-party is led by Zhengchang with 4,000.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 37 yuan, with HSBC Bank's listed U.S. exchange rate reduced by half a yuan, and the standard gold price was 935 yuan, about 27 yuan less than the closing price, which was 4 yuan more than the previous closing. The standard gold price listed by the central bank for the December new standard was 930 yuan 8 jiao, about 22 yuan less than the closing price, which was less than 3 yuan weaker than the previous closing. The book value for this month was 908 yuan, the same price as November, and the same price as December. The water supplement in the morning was 908 yuan, and the pure gold price was 10 and a half yuan higher, with a listed price of 918 yuan 2 jiao. There were still few transactions in the market, and the market was calm. Only Tianjin gang sold 700 taels to Yingfengheng, at a price of 11 and a half yuan higher. The spot spread between November and December was bought by the buyer for 2 yuan to 5 yuan, and then retreated to 3 and a half yuan. After the gold market fell, there was a lack of government bond redemptions, so there were still 21 positions left in this month's position. Fuchang was the buyer, and Tongyiyongfeng was the seller.</p>
<p>In the market transactions, buyers were dominant, and short sellers continued to cover. In summary, Sen Changyong, Yuanchangyong, Tongchun, Dafa, Yongfuxingyong, Dingchang, Hongxing, Xianghe, Ruikangyong, Dedingkang, Dadecheng, Yuanyi, Fuyu, Shenkang, etc. were on the buying side.

<h3 id="e237">Exchange Market Still Tightening <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Although the Silver Market Is Not Satisfactory</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Are Still Energetically Covering</p>

Only the London big position both near and far contracted by 0625, the London gold price fell by two pence, the British exchange against the U.S. dollar rose by two and three seventy-fifths of a point, the British exchange against the French currency rose by fifteen pounds, and the Associated Press telegraphed that the U.S. government's reply to the Chinese protest against silver had been issued, but a date must be agreed upon with the Chinese government to announce its content. On the London side, speculators said that the U.S. government's purchase or not was no longer a problem, and that President Roosevelt said that reducing the fineness of silver dollars was more necessary than gold dollars. After this news came, the exchange market was chaotic at the initial opening, and its market price seemed firmer than the previous closing, but there was a lack of transactions. Only the gold market was still stable, and Chinese merchants' buying interest was still strong. Then, the near-term selling price was British exchange at 1 shilling 6 pence 1875 and U.S. exchange at 37 yuan 375. After opening, it continued to tighten, and Chinese merchants worked hard to cover their shorts. However, the bank still had a selling appetite. HSBC Bank's listed price was revealed, with the British exchange reduced by 25 and the U.S. exchange by half a yuan. At this time, it appeared slightly unsteady. After entering the market, the bank continued to supply, and the central bank fiercely suppressed the near term. It tightened once, but after it was cheap, it was maintained again. The psychology of the Chinese merchants was still frightened. At noon, it changed from loose to tight, forcing the near-term selling price at noon to be British exchange at 1 shilling 6 pence 125 and 1875, and U.S. exchange at 37 yuan 3125. Compared with the previous closing, the British and U.S. currencies were each tighter by 125. Chinese merchants continued to cover more than 1 million U.S. dollars, and the situation in the middle of the day presented a vacillating situation. The transaction records are as follows:</p>

The market price for call loan interest was still six percent in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day.

<p>Recently, spot goods have been seen leaving from time to time. Last week, there were 1.84 million yuan.

<h3 id="e241">Securities and Bonds Market Increasingly Shrinking <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw its market shrink further. The market was more sluggish than before. Spot transactions were predominant, and major players seemed to be holding back. Judging by the current situation, it will be difficult to see a recovery in the short term. However, as the settlement date approaches, this situation will likely be temporary. As for yesterday's trading, the morning session opened weak and lifeless. For the "Bian Yi" bonds and below, there was a slight decrease of five to ten cents. For the "Nian Juan" bonds and below, retail investors made some short covering, and the market price rebounded by ten to twenty cents. In the second session, more short covering by retail investors led to a further increase in market prices by ten to twenty cents. However, the "22 Guan" bonds and below still fell by five to ten cents. The afternoon session opened with a more pronounced decline, and the closing was even more sluggish, with many bonds showing no movement at all. Overall, the market price for the day showed a slight increase of five to thirty-five cents. The total transaction volume was 10,063,000 yuan, and 160 shares of various stocks were traded. A comparative table of the price increases and decreases is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>

<p>The rumor of increased unified tax has agitated the spot yarn market.</p>
<p>丨Japanese merchants still see the market as small丨</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm because there are still over 2,000 bales of spot yarn on the market. People are feeling positive. However, some say that the majority of these bales are speculative in nature, as customers are preparing for the possible increase in unified tax on November 1st, buying ahead as a precaution. As a result, trading is very active. However, in the afternoon, Japanese merchants dumped more stock, and there were rumors that Shenxin Factory was selling large quantities of spot yarn as prices rose.</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, American cotton was suspended, exchange rates slightly contracted, and the gold market rebounded. Due to the tax increase issue, customers continued to purchase spot yarn, causing sentiment to tighten slightly. However, the volume of short selling by Japanese merchants remained unchanged, indicating their bearish outlook. Prices for all months rose slightly by 4, 5, and 6 cents. In the afternoon, despite the fact that over 2,000 bales of spot yarn were sold, market sentiment remained weak. Spot yarn prices were stable, and various factories had sufficient spot goods. In addition, foreign yarns were willing to make concessions, making it difficult to stimulate new buyers. As a result, prices for all months fell slightly by 1 and 2 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 23,850 bales. The sellers included Dafeng (550 bales), Shenji (1,650 bales), Renfeng (950 bales), Yuantai (400 bales), Taichang (550 bales), Changfeng (2,150 bales), Xiesheng (550 bales), Gengfeng (950 bales), Runkang (350 bales), and Dachang (350 bales). The buyers included Dafu (1,950 bales), Tongji (1,000 bales), Dafeng (300 bales), Gengfeng (950 bales), Junchang (450 bales), Yicheng (500 bales), Dachang (500 bales), Xincheng (750 bales), Deji (1,050 bales), Shenchang (500 bales), and Hengde (600 bales). The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales remained brisk, with a total of 2,600 bales purchased by various customer groups throughout the day. The purchase amounts for each group were as follows: Guangdong (775), Jiangxi (40), Inland (185), Tianjin (585), Xuzhou (25), Fellow Traders (466), Luzhou (20), Yunnan (40), Shantou (250), Wuhu (10), and Changsha (270).</p>

<p>The cotton market remained high, with American cotton suspended for Columbus Day, the U.S. dollar exchange rate dropping by half a yuan, and gold prices rebounding. Indian cotton also rose by three rupees. As a result, sentiment turned firm, and bulls became more aggressive. However, factories were very slow to take in spot cotton. However, large quantities have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so capital still feels scarce.</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton futures market, American cotton was suspended, Indian cotton rose by three and a half rupees, and gold prices rebounded, causing sentiment to tighten and buyers to increase. Prices for all months rose by 10 to 15 cents. The afternoon session opened flat, but the second and third sessions saw a firmer market, with distant months rising by 5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 55,700 piculs. Sellers included Jifeng (4,900 piculs), Dafeng (1,900 piculs), Shenji (2,500 piculs), Xinheng (3,400 piculs), Suilong (2,600 piculs), and Tongyu (1,100 piculs).

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was suspended for Columbus Day. British cotton futures rose by one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to short covering and speculative buying, but later fell back due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by European exporters. As a result, Pingguoer and Aomula rose by 3.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is listed below (dated the 12th).</p>

<h3 id="e246">American Cotton Maintained Due to Price Increase Theory <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on October 11th reported on the cotton market for the week: At the beginning of the week, the cotton market was actively covering shorts because the government's cotton production estimate was slightly smaller than expected. However, general buying sentiment did not develop as a result. Subsequently, the market weakened due to continued liquidation by various parties, especially those from overseas. In addition, the Marseille tragedy occurred, and selling became rampant. Before long, European news stabilized sentiment, and market prices rose sharply. Liquidation gradually subsided, and short covering also increased. The strong performance of the stock and wheat markets also contributed to the improvement in the cotton market. The authorities have a better attitude towards commercial news, and President Roosevelt has also proposed his idea of raising prices. The theory of inflation has also been spread again for a time, so the general opinion is that once the various parties have completed their liquidation, the futures price will not necessarily be lower than the government's price for cotton collection and loan issuance. The reason why the various parties have been liquidating recently is that their anticipated inflation ideal has not been realized, and they are inevitably disappointed. Moreover, the stability of the US dollar and the government's cotton loan program have failed to maintain the rising trend, so they are panic-stricken. The cotton cloth market has been quiet this week, but reports of separate sales transactions are still good.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Grain and Flour Market Turns from Weak to Stable <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of first falling and then stabilizing in each month after the opening. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago were closed for the holiday, and Canada fell back by about 50 to 60 cents, so when the prices opened, the near and far term markets were weak, falling by 1 to 1.5 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. Subsequently, as factories threw out stock, most still took a wait-and-see approach, while off-market short positions were slightly covered, so opening prices resumed stability. Until the afternoon opening, near-term sentiment was flat, while the far-term was stable. However, because a warship sailed to Tianjin with an estimated 50,000 bags, delivering to Tianjin at only 2 yuan, 3 jiao, and 1.5 fen, a portion of the standard market covered their shorts, and the market showed good movement. According to industry speculation, factories throw out stocks. Half must be based on whether foreign wheat is profitable, and half must be based on the exchange's restoration of substitutes before it can be lively as usual. As a result, this month was better by 7.5%, November was better by 1%, December was better by 5%, January was better by 1.2%, and February was better by 1.5%.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a trend of being initially flat and then stable in each month after the opening in the morning and afternoon. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago and Canada fell back by about 50 to 60 cents. The market was flat when it first opened in the morning, with little change compared to the previous day. Later, as the flour market turned stable, sentiment also stabilized. Until the afternoon opening, trading in each month was still exceptionally quiet, but there were very few sellers, and the flour market felt like it was turning active again, so market sentiment in each month improved slightly again. Currently, the rise and fall of the wheat market depends purely on the flour market. In the future, the pricing of foreign wheat will still have an inevitable connection with the future of domestic wheat. As a result, this month was better by 4%, November was better by 1%, December was better by 3%, January was better by 2%, and February was better by 2%. The spot wheat market remained quiet because factory demand was weak and prices were not starting.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Kiln Rice Weak, Duyang Superior Rice Sharp <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various customer groups suddenly turned plentiful again compared to the previous day, with an estimated arrival of more than thirty entities (nearly 5,000 shi of goods in total). Kiln rice accounted for half of this, while the rest were limited. Therefore, the market for kiln rice was particularly soft. Although the Qingdao customer group purchased 600 to 700 bags, prices still fell. Thick Xin Geng rice, such as Baige rice and Bai, was scarce, and this street made significant transactions, so the market was firm. Rice such as Duyang superior rice, which was destined for the Zhejiang sales market, gradually became scarce in the Shanghai market, and prices increased by about 2 chi. However, various kinds of broken rice were still generally weak, with slightly soft prices. Xin Yin Yuan rice was thick and supported the market,</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 28 or 29 customer groups arrived from Hexia, and the market had demand for all kinds of rice. Xin Geng broken Geng kiln rice Xin Dujian zero weis were still strong, Chen Baiyuan high-quality goods were sluggish, and mid-quality goods traded slightly. New sheep tip Chen Buke tip's customer demand was ordinary, Yin Yuan goods were few and sold. Xin Geng high-quality was priced slightly high, and mid-quality was firm by a few cents, but the later market turned sluggish. Broken Geng high-quality was stable, and mid-quality was firm by a few cents. The price of Xin Dujian Xin Chen sheep Tip Kuke tip was flat and weak, Kiln rice continued to be reduced by a small corner, and Chen Baiyuan was weak.</p>

<p>Zhangzhou Rice Market is Very Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of foreign Xian rice improved. The freighter "Xiyi Gongyi" was scheduled to arrive yesterday, but it was delayed due to strong winds in the middle of the voyage and had not arrived at the port as of last night. Except for a portion being held by foreign merchants, the spot foreign rice in the market was scarce. Furthermore, the demand in this street was very strong, so the owners were optimistic and raised prices by 10 cents. Since the implementation of the ban in Hunan and Anhui, the demand for Gan province and Jiangzhe inland has been robust, and although large amounts of foreign rice have been determined, the market has not fallen. Although shipments have arrived from various ports in Hankou, Shashi, Taiwan, Wenzhou, and Zhangzhou in recent days, the quantities have been scattered, and the arrivals have not been continuous. Zhangzhou rice is similar to Hexia rice and is more popular in this street. After the Shanghai market declined slightly, production costs were difficult to reconcile, so arrivals have not been strong recently. Currently, there are less than 3,000 bags of rice in stock, and the market is even tighter. After competing to purchase yesterday, the machinery would not sell, with only 24 bags of scattered tickets being opened, priced at 9 yuan and 50 cents. Brown rice was shipped from inland for 1,000 bags, with prices also up to 8 yuan and 30 to 40 cents. Other machine brown rice and various Xian were also actively traded in this street, with an estimated 5,000 bags of brown rice and 220 bags of machine rice being sold, and prices also rising slightly. Jiujiang only handles 3,000 bags of factory Xian spot and futures. Foreign rice is scarce, with statistics showing only 400 bags of Saigon and 200 bags of broken rice being opened.</p>

<p>Recently, the market conditions for soybeans have diverged. New soybeans have seen continuous shipments from various regions, and although there is a market, high prices have resulted in slow sales, so prices have fallen. Old soybeans have seen no new shipments, and inventory is not thick, with only about 50,000 to 60,000 bags. Recently, the market has been lively due to active cake sales, and factories still have demand, so prices have risen. Yesterday, the market sold four vehicles of Yingzhou beans, priced from 3 yuan to 2 yuan and 90 cents. Scattered shipments to this street and inland continue, but as prices rise, demand slackens. An estimated 400 bags of Guide beans were traded, priced at 3 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. Another 200 bags of Dangshan beans were traded, priced at 3 yuan and 1 fen.</p>

<p>Dried Squid Plentiful, Prices Fall</p>
<p>The dried squid harvest is good this year in both the north and south oceans, so goods are arriving in large quantities, and inventories are thick. It is reported that each firm currently has over 5,000 dan in hand, and this does not include the goods from the mountain traders in various regions. According to industry insiders, the total number is estimated to be around 10,000 dan. In recent days, business with customer routes has been quiet. Except for slight purchases by the Jiangxi customer group, customer routes such as Sichuan, Hankou, Fujian, and Guangdong have no demand. The market is selling off, so prices are loosening. Traders are calling for prices of 43 yuan for large pieces of North Supplement, 23 yuan for Gao Zhuang Ning Supplement, and 22 yuan for ordinary grades. The traders' tone is loosening, and if they encounter wholesale transactions, they may be able to offer further discounts. It is unlikely that the market will recover until the customer sales become more active.</p>

<p>Mat Life Sun round meat. Recently, the land has been continuously arriving, and the sales in all directions are sluggish, so the market price is soft.

<h3 id="e256">Abortion and Contraception <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Fortunately</p>
<p>Since Mr. Zi Jiu published the article "Abortion" in issue 31 of this publication, followed by Mr. Zhou Shazi's response to the article, "A Review of Remedial Abortion," in issue 33, it is clear that abortion has become a matter of general public attention. It is no longer the case that those involved act in secrecy and stealth, while bystanders remain dismissive and indifferent, as in the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Zi Jiu pointed out the motives for abortion as: (1) being burdened by economic hardship and unable to afford upbringing; (2) being dedicated to a career, thereby avoiding the trouble of raising children; (3) being physically weak and unable to withstand childbirth; (4) becoming pregnant out of wedlock, fearing social stigma, or having no one to take responsibility. Mr. Shazi added another item: "All patients with mental illnesses, severe tuberculosis patients, etc., should be obliged to control childbirth or have abortions." It can be said that the reasons, significance, and value of "abortion" have been explained in great detail. Here, I only want to briefly discuss other reasons that the two gentlemen overlooked in their writings, and the issue of contraception that is associated with the "abortion" problem.</p>
<p>To begin, regarding abortion, I believe that in addition to the above items, it also has considerable value in other ways, namely: (1) stopping childbearing when the appropriate number of children has been reached, and (2) reducing the risks and complications of broken romances during the initial period of cohabitation. I will now elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This is a problem that is related to many aspects, including family finances, family education, female physiology, children's well-being, and the health of the race. Usually, it is not uncommon for a woman to conceive seven or eight times, or even more than ten times. If they are allowed to be born naturally, then due to the frequency of childbirth, the family's finances will be in a very difficult situation, the mother's body will be greatly depleted, and the later-born children will inevitably be weaker than their older sisters and brothers. Furthermore, the parents' limited energy will make it even more difficult to cope with the education, life, and even daily matters such as sleep, clothing, and food for this large number of children. In that case, how can we talk about children's well-being and the health of the race? Therefore, when there are already many children, childbirth should be stopped artificially, while maintaining normal sexual activity between the two sexes. To achieve these two points, in addition to active contraception, we must rely on passive abortion.</p>
<p>(2) This is a key factor in many divorce cases that are currently being discovered. Due to the deep-rooted concept of individualistic and sacred love, marriage is based on this. However, love that rises too quickly often collapses easily, especially when children are born too early, preventing the mother from working outside the home and increasing the family's burden, leading to economic reasons. Thus, the sacred theory of love, which previously promoted the union, is now used as a reason for divorce. However, at this time, the small child becomes an obstacle to the freedom of both parties to separate, and some even reluctantly maintain a painful life because of it. This is the biggest obstacle between divorced couples, and at the same time, it is a great sacrifice for the child. Therefore, in order to ensure that they do not have children in the first few years of marriage, wait until a suitable amount of time has passed, both parties are confident that the love can last, and the family's finances are not difficult, and then have the children they need. Or, if unfortunately, both parties feel dissatisfied and can divorce decisively, without the burden of children or the disputes over alimony, in addition to implementing contraception from the beginning, abortion is a necessary measure.</p>
<p>Then, I will proceed to talk about "contraception." This has been mentioned from time to time in the above text, and it has also been mentioned several times in Mr. Shazi's article. "It is best to use various reasonable birth control methods before conception, which is a fundamental solution," which is especially clear and accurate. However, because it was written with a focus on abortion, it has not been deeply analyzed. Personally, I feel that one is a prevention before the event, and the other is a remedy after the event. In comparison, the importance of contraception actually exceeds that of abortion.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>
<p>First, in terms of procedure, contraception only requires a little preparation before intercourse, which is an easy task; while abortion, even if the Chinese health authorities have allowed you to openly request it, or there are "reasonable artificial abortion clinics or consulting offices" established, it is still very troublesome. Moreover, at present, society does not publicly allow abortion, not to mention those who mistakenly send their lives to unlicensed midwives and drugs. Even if there are a few skilled surgeons, they either do things in a complicated way or take the opportunity to extort money. The unpleasantness in between can be imagined, not to mention the economic conditions that are attached?</p>
<p>Second, in terms of economic conditions, everything in society is inseparable from the economic foundation. Whether it is contraception or abortion, economics is indeed the most important of all reasons. In order to stop childbearing because of the unbearable burden of life, using contraception methods, the cost is of course limited. But the surgeon's fee for an abortion is very high (of course, this may be different when there is a public institution). Originally, in order to reduce the burden, is this temporary expenditure not enough to stump the poor? Like the woman from Wuxi, Yu Yang, who paid 70 yuan for the abortion fee and was fined 80 yuan by the police, I really feel sorry for her.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of women's health, the need for contraception or abortion is mostly due to physical weakness and the inability to bear the pain of childbirth, then the former is naturally the safest and most convenient method. Abortion, even in very early months, is almost like a miscarriage, which will harm the body to some extent; especially for those who are already weak and sick, to have an abortion, the degree of loss is more serious than natural childbirth. Moreover, according to general experience (perhaps with more theoretical basis), artificial abortion can actually promote conception.</p>
<p>The meaning of comparing contraception and abortion above is only to clearly indicate that contraception is more reasonable, more necessary, and more practical to promote than abortion in fact. If it is "a foregone conclusion", abortion is naturally still a remedial measure; but we must remember that this is only a post-remedial measure!</p>
<p>In short, from all aspects, especially from the economic, women's liberation, and physiological perspectives, abortion does have a value to be established, and contraception is especially necessary to promote.</p>
<p>As for how to practice contraception, this is a practical scientific question, which should rely on the discussion and introduction of legitimate doctors and researchers in this field.</p>
<h3 id="e257">The Work of Modern Soviet Women (Continued) <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Xue Jihui</p>
<p>By Miss M.E. Walker</p>
<p>The medical profession also attracts many women. In the past, only men studied this profession. Now, according to the professors in various universities, the majority of medical students are women. One professor told me very firmly that two-thirds of his students are female. This professor may be an enthusiast for women. I have pleasant memories of talking with female doctors and nurses in Russia. There are many unsung heroes among both types of workers. One young woman, recently certified as qualified, invited me one morning to her small wooden house, two hundred miles from the city. Her working area extends sixty miles east and forty miles west of her residence. Her only means of transportation is a horse or a springless farm cart. She lives a very simple life there alone, with only the most common medicines. While busy treating diseases, setting bones, pulling teeth, and assisting in childbirth, she also takes care of three types of serious illnesses: pneumonia, malaria, and meningitis. She puts these three patients in a room in her small wooden house, which she calls "my hospital." In the evenings, she spends all her time lecturing to the villagers on hygiene, first aid, cleanliness, and prevention of tuberculosis, etc.</p>
<p>At a certain university, I met a team of female medical students, many of whom were working and studying at the same time. They used their spare time to set up a sanatorium in the school for those classmates who were malnourished or unhealthy. They also set up a cafeteria, providing the most hygienic food at the lowest prices. They maintained this work for three years, even though they had to get up at five o'clock every morning to prepare breakfast. They felt that this was simply a responsibility they owed to their comrades.</p>
<p>One day, I spoke with nurses at a certain hospital and learned that they were connected with several social service organizations that I had known before. She specializes in visiting families, especially in densely populated areas of large cities. She reports all hygienic shortcomings, infectious diseases, and unsanitary conditions. Their work has many similarities to our social service work, but their authority is much greater. No family, factory, shop, or public place can escape their supervision. One of the greatest panic of their work: is the movement to ban prostitution, ban alcohol, and eliminate superstition. A team of female workers, in order to promote the temperance movement, organized public cafeterias everywhere so that workers could get good food and drinks under their management. They said this was a fundamental way to eradicate drinking, and they would continue to work hard until the bad habit of drinking was completely eliminated. They argued for the elimination of the burden of housework that binds women on the grounds of gender equality; because this burden is enough to prevent women from serving the country and other jobs.</p>
<p>Those nurses I mentioned above also told me that they would be the vanguard in the anti-illiterate midwife movement among the Tartar people. During the preparation period, they not only had to learn a foreign language, but also had to prepare lectures on various social issues, methods of preventing diseases, and even teach people to read and write. Many women are engaged in this work; among this small nation, many people still live a nomadic life, and they naturally oppose others interfering with their long-standing way of life. They believe that women's liberation is a catastrophe that they need to put out by all means. However, the germ of women's freedom has penetrated deep into their tribes. Those women are eagerly accepting it. Some have even removed their veils and come out to study, or even become representatives in the National Assembly. These women return to cooperate with personnel sent from Moscow, Leningrad, or Kharkov to do advocacy work. They feel that women in these backward nations need the ability to live independently in order to achieve freedom and liberation. Therefore, they improved family industries and peasant industries based on appropriate business principles. In some places, they restored various crafts that had long been forgotten.</p>
<p>Regarding the medical field, I also observed another situation: women can do medical research work. I found that the director of a large microbiology academy, Montessori (Montessori) P · N · E · U several systems, and not like any one. Those children are certainly very happy, full of many meanings, often expressed in sand piles, perforated paper, or loess. Outsiders may find it strange how our country catches and punishes those who engage in speculative activities and commit crimes—they are usually subjected to severe penalties—but there is no secret. A large team of women specializes in this work. They mix with the shoppers in the vegetable market or on busy streets in the city. While shopping, they pay close attention to everyone passing by. They are very familiar with all the tricks of fraud, especially those that harm the interests of the state. Therefore, these behaviors rarely escape their keen observation. They are obviously the great enemies of deceivers; if they find fraudulent behavior, they will be severely punished. If the defrauded is a worker, they will be dealt with even more severely. If the person taking advantage is not a worker in the narrow sense, their punishment will be even more severe.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Talking About Crying <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Wu</p>
<p>Last year we talked about domestic goods, but in a country that relies on agriculture and in a year of good harvest, we still imported large quantities of foreign rice and foreign wheat. This year we talked about women, but women have become even more confined to the home, becoming prostitutes, and being reduced to maids and concubines. Talking is indeed only talking! But there is nothing to say, so we still have to talk.</p>
<p>It has always been thought that women "are good at crying": in ancient times, there was the wife of Hua Zhou Qiliang, who cried for her husband for ten days, and the city wall collapsed; in recent times, there were female students from Beiping Peiman School, who gathered to cry all day long on "September 18," without eating or drinking. It seems that this saying is quite true. But Shen Baoxu cried at the Qin court for seven days and seven nights, and Ruan Ji cried over the road to ruin, who knows how many times in his life. These men are also crying men.</p>
<p>Those who suffer and endure hardship and have unspeakable pain in their hearts cannot help but wail. When the Northeast was first lost, hundreds of thousands of people across the country surrounded the government and cried bitterly, surrounding the mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen and crying bitterly. The capital was filled with wailing. Now that the three years of mourning have ended, there is still a final scene of female students gathering and crying in Beiping.</p>
<p>Family members cry for those who have been devastated and harmed; the people cry for the country that has been invaded and annexed. Only those like the wife of Chen Huasheng, who sells herself into prostitution to maintain her husband's livelihood, but finally cannot be tolerated and is killed by her husband; no one in society sheds tears for such people, and even their close relatives, such as their maternal uncles, avoid asking and hearing about it. This corner has become a place without tears.</p>
<p>Silently enduring devastation and oppression, from pain to death, without receiving a single tear from people, such people are filling the society. Just looking at the women's side, the evil diseases entangled with prostitutes, the unhealthy development of maids, the hardships endured by wives and concubines—these things have generally been regarded as natural. Things that are taken for granted do not need pity.</p>
<p>Where does this "natural" view come from? Needless to say, it is the crystallization of politics, law, etiquette, customs, and all the ideas of respecting men and despising women. The hearts of society have been stirred by thousands of years of thought like paste, and hundreds of thousands of people have fallen into it, without causing ripples or reactions. For the sake of the oppressed, especially the oppressed women, this is the most worthy place to cry bitterly.</p>
<p>Crying for one person's experience, crying for the devastation of one family, is not even the sound of ants in society. It is necessary to connect with millions of people who shed tears in secret before it can be hoped to become a roar. Shout down the old ideas, old morals, old systems, and everything that is broken and incomplete and unable to cope with today's serious oppression of imperialism in this society that is dead and confused.</p>
<p>Once confined to the family, she does not know the greatness of society, but only cries for the insignificance of herself. This will continue with her great-great-grandmother and even her great-great-granddaughter, crying endlessly. The so-called women "are good at crying" actually becomes especially not good at crying.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Child Rearing <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Fei</p>
<p>China started women's schools in 1907 (the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign) and has been doing so until now. It can be said that it has spent money on the education of "virtuous mothers and good wives". Even now, female students in various universities are still learning "domestic affairs" courses! However, speaking of the effect, it is extremely pitiful; may I ask, who has seen a few typical virtuous mothers and good wives? And who can stand up and say, "I am worthy of the title of virtuous mother and good wife without any guilt"? There is no doubt that it is a complete failure. This is not accidental: First, the educated people, at least the middle-class women, have nothing to do with the general public, that is, the majority of workers and peasants; secondly, these educated women marry into middle-class families and spend their days calling servants and maids. If they have children, they are handed over to wet nurses. Their only task is to provide entertainment! And they themselves, aware of the fact that "love fades as beauty fades," naturally use all their energy to dress up and decorate themselves! Needless to say, this group of people has formed a life view of being a doll, and they are not virtuous mothers and good wives at all. As for marrying into middle-class families, the family life habits are completely opposite to those in school. The seven things to open the door, the domestic affairs textbooks are not enough to deal with, and production and child rearing cannot be begged for lectures! So they respectfully accept the traditional family style and habits, or they are lazy and do nothing, and everything is ignored. So everything "remains the same"! So we constantly hear criticisms like "the bad effects after liberation". In fact, the women's education in the past was only regarded as decoration by those who ran it, and those who studied it only did it to catch up with fashion. Both the teachers and the students ignored the principle of "being a person": (occasional successful or awakened women were not the power of school education). It can be seen that the women's education in the past was not based on the education of "people" with the principle of equality between men and women! Moreover, the public establishment of women's schools only focused on families above the middle class, and those who went to receive education were all women with money and leisure. As for the working, peasant, and poor masses, their food and clothing were deprived, so what are we talking about women's education!</p>
<p>"Ignoring everything about the children and letting them be natural," no one has ever advocated this. However, phenomena such as "poor people's children wandering around the streets with disheveled hair and dirty faces, and rich people's children wandering around at home in a charming and delicate way, and when they grow up, they all wander around in society in a confused and dark way, the same as their fathers, or even worse," can this kind of phenomenon be solved by the virtuous mother and good wife doctrine? However, this is still a phenomenon in 1918 (see "Hot Wind"), and now it is still it, or even worse.</p>
<p>There are also people who know how to cherish children, or who intend to raise children according to the theory of child-centeredness, but in the family, it is certainly impossible to do it in a large family. Even in a small family, it is still a fantasy. I remember "The Family of Retribution" (see "Wandering") which describes a pair of newlyweds with ideals, but the whip of life made the heroine lose her courage and the smile on her face, leaving a irritable temper and a pair of gloomy eyes. She often beat the child until he cried! And the master also failed to work because of this, and often got up to tease the child (such as doing "cat washing face," etc.), ":: I am afraid that in the future it will be five five twenty-five, nine nine eighty-one! :: And two eyes are gloomy::" His sad mood makes people feel disappointed! Another example is an article "Children" in "Back View", which is Zhu Ziqing writing about his own situation with his children. It is not that he does not understand the philosophy and ethics of raising children, nor is it that he does not know the loveliness of children, only because the children will quarrel and make noise, making him "If I sit at home reading or writing something, I will have to be distracted several times in an hour, or stand up once or twice. If it is a rainy day or a Sunday, and the children are at home a lot, then, I can't read a line after opening a book, and I can't write a word when I pick up a pen:::". So he "still deals with it barbarically according to the ancient tradition, like ordinary fathers"::: "Corporal punishment and scolding"! He even said in a letter to Sheng Tao, "The torment of children is really helpless; sometimes I even feel that suicide is better." Although he later shed tears for these and cried a lot.</p>
<p>The above are seen from books, let's talk about a current event; a certain gentleman, the current director of the Department of Education of a certain national university, is a child psychology expert himself, and his wife is a professional talent who graduated from a women's higher normal school. He took several biological children and lived in the new village of the professor environment. This kind of family, this kind of parents, this kind of environment, should be ideal! However, the children's experience is no exception to the general one; beating and scolding cannot be avoided! The reason is nothing more than that the children are noisy, restless, and hinder work, and so on.</p>
<p>Based on the examples cited above, it can be seen that the family is not a paradise for children, and it is not enough to bear the responsibility of good nurturing and education. The truth of the new-style families of the middle and upper-middle-class intellectuals is like this, and the general working, peasant, and poor families are even more what we can see everywhere we open our eyes! It can be seen that "bearing the responsibility of educating new children," even the new-style families of intellectuals, are not worthy of it.</p>
<p>The general prejudice is that direct parents are more fond of their children than others, and they cannot rest assured to hand them over to others. And people with well-developed maternal instincts especially cannot bear to leave their children by themselves. In fact, we all have emotions and reason. "Love your young ones and extend it to the young ones of others," "Treat your compatriots as your own," and humans have not only had this kind of thinking since now - it is even more developed now! Also, love; and how to love? are two things! Education; and how to educate well? are also two things! For children, what is considered to be able to love reasonably - not to fall into doting, and loving them is just to harm them - to educate, how can we educate in the right way - so that they are happy and prosperous, and both body and spirit can be healthy! We should always take care of this. Besides, the more important point is; in the past, people generally regarded children as their own possessions - property, mostly having raising without education. Even if they taught, it was only to honor the ancestors and make the family prosperous! There were very few parents who made them become "national scholars". Now; whether we regard children as members of the country or cells of humanity, at least we should not make them "take the family as the world | as the universe" anymore! May I ask, can even the most ideal family be competent for this kind of education? Should we not now transfer the responsibility of nurturing and educating children from the family to the society? We have emotions and reason, we should make children become members who adapt to or create a new society - and never make them consistently belong to the boils of the family again!</p>
<h3 id="e260">General Life of Women in Shantou <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Yujiong</p>
<p>(Shantou Correspondence)</p>
<p>I arrived in Shantou a week ago, intending to conduct a more detailed and comprehensive observation of the general living conditions of women here. That is why I am only now able to pick up my pen.</p>
<p>The first thing we must acknowledge about the women here is that they are healthy. The various labels of "morbid beauty" and "Oriental beauty" are simply inapplicable to them.</p>
<p>(1) Women in Schools || The majority of female students in schools here are quite healthy and simple. However, in a Chinese society heavily shrouded in feudal ideas, we have never seen a place, whether it be an institution or a school, where men and women enjoy equal development. Shantou is no exception.</p>
<p>With the global economic panic sweeping over us, the sluggishness of the Shantou market is obviously apparent to us. Under immense pressure, most of the women in Shantou have been driven back to their families, with no further opportunity to enjoy the benefits of school education! Consequently, the number of women in schools here is indeed very small!</p>
<p>(2) Women in Families || The habit of not treating women as equals, which has persisted for thousands of years, is still deeply ingrained here! Aside from a small number of upper-class women who can spend their days at home doing nothing, living the life of a young mistress or young lady, most women in families have to toil in the homes of ordinary people, performing arduous household chores!</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy here is that in some relatively affluent families, they often employ several poor girls under the age of ten as "maids." They work tirelessly every day until they are nearly sixteen or seventeen years old, when they become adults. At this point, the male head of the household, regardless of whether he is gray-haired or over ninety years old, will take these teenage maids to satisfy their "sexual desires," ostensibly elevating them to the status of "concubine"! In reality, they remain in the position of "maid," with no rights to enjoy in the family, because there are still several layers of powerful figures above them – the so-called first wife and other concubines! I have noticed this phenomenon particularly in the Guangdong area. Therefore, the practice of taking "maids" as concubines is seen as commonplace in Guangdong. As a result, can't we see that the women in the so-called South, who loudly proclaim the tide of women's liberation, are in such a pitiful situation?</p>
<p>(3) Women in Rural Areas || Under the extremely bankrupt state of the countryside, the vast majority of women in the South have no choice but to flock to the cities to find a way to make a living. Some, although unable to move to the city, still lead very difficult lives in the countryside. When we were coming south from Shanghai, as the ship approached the dock, I couldn't distinguish between men and women. Wearing straw hats, bent over, and barefoot, they carried heavy loads on the road. Finally, a friend told me that these were poor rural women carrying grain or vegetables to sell in the city! There are also many fruit stalls on the streets run by women. In short, most of the women in Shantou are productive, healthy, and simple, but they are also very impoverished and struggling to live under dual oppression.</p>
<h3 id="e261">An Interview with the Shanghai Jiliang Institute <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>It was an afternoon with the autumn wind blowing and teeth chattering. I went alone to the Shanghai Jiliang Institute on Niuzhuang Road.</p>
<p>The surroundings were filled with a strong Christian atmosphere. The walls were hung with illustrations from the Bible. The doors were plastered with Jesus' commandments. From next door came the hymns sung by the children of the institute's affiliated free primary school.</p>
<p>While waiting to be received, I was almost forced to suffocate. Ten minutes passed before a kind-looking elderly believer, Ms. Kong, appeared at the door inside.</p>
<p>According to her own introduction, she was in charge of management responsibilities. So, we opened the conversation with mutual modesty.</p>
<p>"First, please tell me about the general situation of your institute," I said first.</p>
<p>Ms. Kong thought for a moment and replied, "The institute's regular expenses are four thousand per month, mostly sourced from fundraising by the board of directors from the church. Although the patrol room and the Public Security Bureau provide monthly subsidies, the amount is small.</p>
<p>The organization of the institute is now divided into three parts: (1) Adults: that is, the women's section. (2) Children: referring to minors. (3) Hospital: This is specifically for treating illnesses of women or children in the institute. However, sometimes outsiders are also treated. In short, it is all charitable in nature.</p>
<p>Their daily lives in the women's section are as follows: Breakfast at 7:00 AM. Classes from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Lunch after class. Sleep from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Handicrafts, such as embroidery and sewing, are taught from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Stroll after 4:00 PM. Dinner at 6:00 PM. Night study from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Lights out at 9:00 PM. As for the children's section, it is exactly the same as a regular primary school, with full-day classes.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about six hundred people in the entire institute, with adult women accounting for about two-thirds of them.</p>
<p>"What are the main reasons they come to the institute? Are there any who come to request admission on their own?" I asked after she finished the above.</p>
<p>"The reasons for coming to the institute are mostly because they were 'sold' or 'abused.' After a court judgment, they are all sent here. Therefore, there were quite a few prostitutes in the institute in the past. Of course, there are also those who come to request admission on their own, but we rarely accept them. In fact, in such a large city as Shanghai, if we were to help everyone, we would be overwhelmed."</p>
<p>"What kind of books do they read?"</p>
<p>"The books they read are mostly books that encourage people to do good. The Bible is the main subject. The reason is very simple: our food is given to us by God, so naturally we should absolutely believe in God, right?" Ms. Kong said with unusual excitement. At the same time, she pointed to the sky, as if telling people that God lived there.</p>
<p>"Is the education in the women's section equivalent to that of primary school?"</p>
<p>"The institute only goes up to the primary school level, but if there are promising girls, the institute can ask the church to provide them with secondary school education, even university education. However, this right is not available to women. According to the regulations, women can only stay in the institute for one year. After one year, they are matched with a spouse."</p>
<p>"What is the method of choosing a spouse? Is there any contact after leaving the institute?"</p>
<p>"There are no specific regulations for choosing a spouse here. Usually, it is introduced by women who have left the institute. After the institute sends someone to investigate and approve, it is done. The women who have left the institute regard this place as their natal family, so they often come and go. Today, there are two people upstairs visiting me." A smile appeared on Ms. Kong's face.</p>
<p>"How is daily management handled?"</p>
<p>"Ah! It is absolutely strict. They cannot receive any outside guests."</p>
<p>By the time the conversation reached this point, the primary school section had already rung the bell for the end of classes. At the same time, the questions seemed to have come to an end, so I stood up and left.</p>
<p>On the way back, I felt as if a sharp stone was pressing on my heart, feeling uneasy for these women who were ostracized from the circle of life.</p>
<p>Although, due to various reasons, I did not go into the women's workplace to observe them in person, the general situation can be inferred from the above conversation under such an environment.</p>
<p>Why can't we have the facilities of a Jiliang Institute ourselves?</p>
<p>I hope that our women's community can pay close attention to this serious question.</p>

<h3 id="e262">Reality and Phenomenon <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Yufu</p>
<p>Reality and phenomenon are two different categories. Reality refers to the objective and actual essence of things that exist. Phenomenon, on the other hand, is what arises from this essence. We often say "social phenomenon," which is not the reality of society, but what is derived from this reality. Every phenomenon necessarily has a certain real foundation; conversely, every reality necessarily gives rise to a certain phenomenon: reality is the mother, phenomenon is the son.</p>
<p>Hegel said, "…but man is not satisfied with merely recognizing phenomena, merely recognizing sensory phenomena. He wants to know what is hidden behind the phenomena, he wants to know what that thing looks like, and he wants to study it. Therefore, we strive to know through thinking that something that is different from itself and the phenomenon, that is, the cause: striving to know the essence that is different from the merely external thing."</p>
<p>Viewing phenomenon and essence as two different categories is Hegel's strength; but his idea that essence is like a soul contained within the phenomenon turns the problem upside down. We know that in physics, there are two categories: essence and phenomenon, but the essence exists objectively, while the phenomenon arises from the essence. Without the essence of the sun, earth, and moon, there would be no phenomena of solar and lunar eclipses. If we shift the problem to social sciences, it is the same. Clearly, there must be the reality of a feudal society or a capitalist society before there can be the phenomena of a feudal society or a capitalist society. It is not the phenomenon of this society that determines its reality, but the reality of this society that produces its phenomena. The problem is that Hegel's view must be reversed to be a scientific explanation.</p>
<p>However, reality and phenomenon are not absolutely different. Under a certain reality, a certain phenomenon will necessarily occur; they are consistent. Ulyanov said, "There is never a fundamental difference between phenomena and the essence of things, and there cannot be such a (fundamental) difference: if there is a difference, it only exists between what is known and what is unknown." This is a true insight. Before we know that electric light and thunder are phenomena that arise from the contact of positive and negative electricity, we certainly will not know the relationship between electric light, thunder, and positive and negative electricity: this is an example of how the difference between essence and phenomenon exists between what is known and what is unknown.</p>
<p>Similarly, in social sciences, a certain social phenomenon must be adapted to a certain reality; there is no fundamental difference between them. For example, the social phenomena of kidnapping, murder, suicide, prostitution, rape, etc., that occur in Shanghai must be consistent with the essence of the real Shanghai society; and the current global economic panic and unemployment crisis are also adapted to the reality of the current capitalist society: these are all very obvious examples.</p>
<p>Therefore, we say that reality and phenomenon are both different and not different: the difference lies in the fact that the phenomenon is the product of reality, reality is the mother, and phenomenon is the son; there is no fundamental difference in that a certain phenomenon necessarily arises from a certain reality, and the phenomenon is consistent with reality, with no fundamental difference.</p>
<p>As for our recognition of reality and grasp of reality, it must be done through phenomenon. Because reality is the foundation, and phenomenon is its product, we can only recognize reality through phenomenon when the phenomenon arising from reality stimulates our senses. For example, our recognition of the reality of capitalist society that has reached the most advanced stage is from the social phenomena of commodity surplus, market shortage, economic panic, unemployment crisis, etc., in this society; we must recognize its reality through these social phenomena, otherwise we will have no way to recognize it.</p>
<p>Social phenomena are very complex and often very contradictory. Clearly, in the current world, on the one hand, there is the promotion of Christian equality and universal love, and on the other hand, there is the social phenomenon of people oppressing people: these are all very contradictory. Therefore, to recognize reality, we cannot observe it from only one aspect, but must recognize the true face of reality through this contradictory phenomenon. Because although these phenomena are contradictory, these contradictory phenomena are all products of reality and are all consistent with reality.</p>
<p>At the same time, society is a whole, and although the phenomena arising from its reality are complex and contradictory, each phenomenon is interconnected. Therefore, we cannot isolate these phenomena and observe them in isolation, but must synthesize them and make a comprehensive study. Only in this way can we recognize reality through phenomenon. Conversely, errors will occur. For example, in the current global economic panic, some industries, such as military industries, have a phenomenon of "prosperity"; if we only observe this phenomenon in isolation and praise the meaning of this "prosperity," then we are wrong, and that cannot be considered recognizing the reality that produces this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition, everything is changing, and so are reality and phenomenon, so we should grasp the phenomenon and recognize reality in the midst of change.</p>

<h3 id="e263">Private School Teacher <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Shucun</p>
<p>Private school teachers still maintain an important position in the inland provinces today, when "universal education" is only seen on paper. New education has not yet gained widespread belief. Not only are there many cases of setting up private schools in inland villages and towns, but even the high-ranking officials and dignitaries of today often hire teachers to teach in order to improve their children's knowledge of classical learning. In the relatively developed provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where primary schools are everywhere, many private school teachers have changed their profession to become primary school teachers, but private schools have not completely disappeared. Even in the prosperous Shanghai, which is at the forefront of trends, private schools still exist in poor areas. The author, who likes to study social phenomena, has previously visited teachers who teach children of slum dwellers in Caoshang Nei, West Shanghai, and has also spoken with teachers hired by poor people in Pudong, and has also visited a private school in the countryside of Jiangwan. The number of private schools in Shanghai is so large, not to mention the inland.</p>
<p>In fact, the development of private schools is not only due to need, but there are often cases where a "school" is formed in order to solve the occupational problem of a private school teacher. Private school teachers are intellectuals left over from the old society. These people do not understand the new knowledge. If they do not rely on being proficient in classics, history, poetry, and lyrics, and are hired to set up a school, they would originally be eliminated in this new environment. These people may have had a dazzling and glorious past, but with the progress of the times, they have to step into the path of decline and face the current problem of life. Those who are capable may move to become officials; the next best can draft telegrams and handle literary affairs for dignitaries; those who are worse off have no choice but to be satisfied with being a private school teacher.</p>
<p>Although they are all private school teachers, the teaching labor and treatment are completely different. Among them, the more comfortable and well-paid are those who teach in the families of some important people. The important people treat you as a "teacher" with politeness and consideration. They admire your great name and invite you to come, they have faith in you, and they will never let your annual salary be lower than three hundred to five hundred yuan. In the past, it was not surprising that some officials with great power were willing to spend eighteen hundred yuan a year to hire a "teacher." Now, even a county magistrate or administrative commissioner does not lack the ability to</p>

<p>take out about four hundred yuan a year in salary to hire a "scholar" with a solid foundation. In addition to the regular salary, the "teacher" can also get various benefits. If your master is a "popular person" in society or has considerable influence in politics, it is not difficult to get you a "half-official position" as a result of your activity and request. This can be done by "moonlighting" or "receiving a dry salary," or if their young masters and ladies all go to school, they will let you "substantively take over" this position. Over time, you may very well become a prominent official. But this kind of thing is ultimately the most fortunate and rare. Most private school teachers do not have this kind of benefit. Some restrained "old masters" even feel restrained by the master's excessive politeness; if the students are naughty again, they will even "resign" on the pretext. The master often treats them with exquisite food, but they may prefer to enjoy "plain tea and rice"; the master may provide them with some daily necessities such as handkerchiefs and socks, but they prefer to "prepare their own." There are also many such people.</p>
<p>Such private school teachers mostly have a solid foundation in classical learning. Not only are they proficient in classics, history, philosophy, collections, lyrics, songs, and poetry, but they can also write congratulatory messages, obituaries, elegiac couplets, antithetical couplets, and other social articles. Some are also good at official documents and four-six parallel prose with sonorous tones. Their being hired also comes from their works being appreciated. For example, there are quite a few such things now; an official sees a well-written congratulatory message (or lament, or eulogy...) somewhere, and if he likes it, he will ask someone to invite the author to tutor his young master in "national studies." This is accidental, but of course, it is usually introduced by acquaintances or friends.</p>
<p>Originally, there was a difference between "classics schools" and "elementary schools" in private schools. The teachers hired by some important people mentioned above are mostly biased towards the "classics school" aspect of lecturing on classics. What is taught is still nothing more than "classical Chinese" or the Four Books and Five Classics, Zuo Zhuan, etc. Of course, there are also those who teach "national language." In addition, there is also a kind of old master who teaches "classics school." They often regret the "new learning." Parents may have the same view as him, or they may think that classical learning is indispensable in future society. Even if their children have entered junior high school, they still want to take advantage of the opportunity to stuff them into this kind of "classics school" to learn a little classical Chinese and composition. This plan is all for the future to be good at "being an official," and the worse can also be gentlemen and handle writing in the townships. Therefore, there are quite a few "pedantic" gentlemen in the inland now who recruit many disciples from all directions. Although they cannot have "three thousand disciples" like Confucius, it is not a problem to have a dozen or two or thirty outstanding students. In the inland, this kind of school is not worried about not having a place to open. There are ancestral halls, ancestral halls, and public temples or other public residences everywhere. This kind of old master and "university student" can also be inserted in the famous families of "generations of scholars," so this kind of old master is not worried about not having a school.</p>
<p>The annual income of such an "old master" is also very good. Such a "university student," according to their level and family circumstances, must pay the "teacher" from fifteen to forty or fifty yuan in "school fees" each year. Assuming that a "teacher" can teach more than a dozen students, it is not difficult to get three or four hundred yuan. The cost of living in the inland is lower, and this amount may be considerable for them. If they ask questions in society and work as local lawyers, they can even slowly "get rich" (but some stubborn and moral old masters look down on this kind of person).</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to talk about the life of the most miserable kind of private school teacher, the one who teaches "elementary school." The first thing I want to say is their meager treatment. There are those who teach for a whole year with sore throats and get only twenty or thirty yuan. More is no more than seventy or eighty yuan, and it is difficult to exceed one hundred yuan. Farmers are only willing to pay three or four yuan or five or six yuan in tuition each year, and the teacher's students are only a dozen or two children, and the minimum is only seven or eight children, so there will be no more income. There are workers from the Jiangbei gang, the Lianghu gang, the Anhui gang, and the Shandong gang... who hire teachers to come to Shanghai from their local areas. The annual income of this kind of teacher is also difficult to exceed one hundred yuan, so the teachers who teach elementary school are generally poor. But their work is very heavy. They have to manage many stubborn children who do not know a single word, "hold their hands" to teach them to write, and teach many children who are "as stupid as pigs" ten times, a hundred times... but in the end, it is still in vain. If you are not a patient teacher, I guarantee that you will lose your temper a hundred times a day and beat those students until they cry... You often have to shout loudly, shake the "ruler," and put on a terrible face to make some very naughty barefoot children afraid of you... The pain in this kind of life can be said to be "inexpressible."</p>

<p>— Liangyi</p>
<p>A child in the sixth group of the fifty-ninth school, named Slavo, Roweikov. He has an accurate timetable hanging by his bed at home. It is written like this:</p>
<p>"My Life Timetable"</p>
<p>1. Get up at 7:00 AM and have a good wash (don't forget to brush your teeth).</p>
<p>2. Be sure to do schoolwork.</p>
<p>3. Strengthen my muscles and bones in every way I can (except for wiping shoes).</p>
<p>4. Make an airplane model this summer.</p>
<p>5. Compete in socialism with my father.</p>
<p>6. Do not go to the cinema more than twice in ten days.</p>
<p>7. Be a true Young Pioneer."</p>
<p>That last item has been changed to: "Be a true socialist builder."</p>
<p>The seven rules written by Slavo could have their names signed on them by more than 600,000 citizens of the Soviet Republic over the age of twelve. Indeed, some of them do not make that airplane model, but make a radio or electric motor, and some may not be able to stop themselves from going to the cinema once a day, but the seventh item on this timetable remains the same.</p>
<p>There is also a black-haired, tall child in the sixth group named Koje, Gigs. His limbs are very long, showing sturdy and powerful-looking outside the short sleeves of his shirt; his boots are like a small sapling, coming out of the roof of a dilapidated thatched house.</p>
<p>Gigs is fourteen years old, one year younger than the October Revolution; all he knows about the Tsarist era is from hearsay and books. In those books, there are often many new words that make it difficult for him, many words that he and his companions cannot understand. Gigs deals with those new words by marking them underneath and then satisfying his desire for knowledge in the dictionary later. It is not surprising that he does not understand these words, because they are not only rarely used now, but have also disappeared; so words like "successful people," "preachers," "luck," "His Majesty the Emperor," etc., sound strange and unfamiliar to them.</p>
<p>Once, Gigs saw the word Batman (a military officer's attendant) and said, "What is this?" And after thinking for a while, he gave this conclusion: "Maybe it's someone who plays baseball?"</p>
<p>Gigs' parents are both workers. He and Slavo went to the same school and both belong to the sixth group. In the morning, on a beautiful autumn morning with a chill in the air, the first lesson for the sixth group was gymnastics.</p>
<p>"Are you ready? One, two, three!" the gymnastics teacher shouted.</p>
<p>Light, active, their legs were bouncing on the parallel bars. Their chests were broad, and their muscles were bulging; the large gym was full of light and air. As Slavo grabbed onto the swing frame, he began to whisper to his companion next to him, "Hey! I signed a contract with my father today!</p>
<p>"You're lying."</p>
<p>"Really, I'll show you at recess."</p>
<p>At recess, Slavo pulled out a</p>

<p>— Translated by Shui E</p>
<p>Hope is a daytime dream.</p>
<p>No matter how much you scrub pigs, they will still go to the mud.</p>
<p>Except for the heavenly gate, money can enter any door.</p>
<p>Many people, many opinions.</p>
<p>The lazy man's tongue is never lazy.</p>
<p>The hungry, begging for power on the stage, are politicians. The hungry, begging for food on the roadside, are beggars.</p>
<p>"Denial" makes small mistakes become big.</p>
<p>Buy land quickly, marry wives slowly.</p>
<p>A dog that barks from afar will never bite.</p>
<p>If you tie gold to a bird's wings, the bird will never be able to fly in the sky.</p>
