<p>依舊安然穏定。一方面支持凡爾賽和約動摇之局勢。一方面又維持其歐洲金融界牛耳之地位。使德意諸國。不能不聽法郎勢力之支配。甚至英鎊美金。亦不免受其影響。誠非易事不料事變突出意外。巴黎近郊撞車。原爲偶然事件。史逹維斯基騙案。亦非有關法蘭西大體之案。而竟因街頭之一暴動。至於無法維持。秩序盡破。查法國之議會政治。小黨林立。無讑右黨中央派各黨。左派共和黨。共和社會黨。急進社會黨。社會黨等。任何一黨。最多不過一百五十個議席。絶無擁有多數控制議院勢力之可能。因是以議會信任爲根據之内閣。亦實無法以施行其所謂民主政治。而祇好以聯立形式。組織多黨内閣。則其基礎之不能穏固。壽命之不能永久。勢已顯然。最近兩年以來。自赫里歐·彭古·達拉第·薩洛·旭丹·以及次之達拉第内閣。已經六次之迭更。大都以社會及急進社會黨爲中心。而亦皆不能長久。蓋議會特殊之形勢使然。苟非其執政諸人有相當之經騐者。不知已釀成若干次之混亂矣。</p>
<p>自世界大戰以來。法國之傳統政策。屬於保持現狀一類。故任何人組織内閣。皆與對外政策與對内設施。不發生若何嚴重結果。而此次巴黎城内。竟發生巴斯地以來未有之大暴動。王黨到處示威。共黨到處反示威。祇巴黎一處。死傷逹四百餘人。且將遍及里昂·馬賽·等重要城市。逹拉第内閣。雖在衆議院中以三零零票之多數獲得信任。但以街頭失敗。羣衆反抗之故。至不能不出於總辭。内閣之壽命。爲時僅一星期。亦云鮮矣。此種情勢。雖於法蘭西國家整個前途。未必有巨大之影響。但議會政治。今後將更見動摇。可以預　。蓋法蘭西議會之表現。亦已脫離羣衆。殊難適應民衆之要求。而民衆之將趨向於何途。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>吾人考察法國前途·有三點可注意·（一）巴黎暴動。固屬法内部之局部政治問題。但對法國整個社會。不無嚴重之影響。在政治問題上。在在均有關係。其將由此而趨於右傾乎。抑否乎。其影響可及於全歐。使國際關係感受强烈之刺激。特别是對德國與意大利。更值得注意。（二）法國陸軍軍備。堪稱歐洲第一。但其人口則陷於停頓狀態。常備兵額。竟不能以法國之壯丁充當。而徵用非洲之士人。據此一端。卽足以窺見法蘭西之困難不易克服。（三）法國雖擁有八百億法郎之巨額現金。在理當能繼續支持其金本位制度。維繫其對歐洲諸國之債權。保持其金融之世界的優勢。然於法國境内。則仍將陷於僵局。物價低落與生産過剩。終爲慢性的硬化。卽政府財政六十億法郎之預算赤字。亦難塡補。因此一般人民感負擔之過重。前途亦覺難以穏定也。日軍向俄發動耶</p>

<p>（東京）中島商相因尊氏問題引咎辭職之經緯如下、卽昨日下午、商相對新聞記者言明、决不能由余個人意志而進退、於是貴院全般之空氣乃益惡化、勢將提出彈劾政府之决議案、政府見此形勢、非常狼狽、痛感制先善處之必要、故於下午四時半、堀切秘書長與中島商相會見、意在請求中島商相之自决、中島商相亦知事已至此、乃以因病不堪職爲理由、提出辭呈、於是堀切秘書長立派入間野總理秘書往四谷齋藤首相之私邸、面遞中島商相之辭呈、首相立召前法制局長松本蒸治、懇请繼任商相、經松本面允後、始將中島商相之辭呈、傳達宮中云、（八日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）貴族院中島商相關於尊氏問題、當初政府以爲未許樂觀、畢竟中島商相因此而引咎辭職、曾於七日之本會議由三室户子爵迫及齋藤首相要求奏荐商相、並極力追求答辯、至八日之本會議時、政府仍未置答、而延至九日之本會議、在政府則以首相之答辯如何、恐惹起重大之結果、爲愼重起見、故將八日之速記錄調齊、對於三室户子爵所質問詳細加以檢討、同時在院内閣議席上詳細商榷、但以政府之立塲、只好由首相堅持表示遺憾之意、或可將奏荐商相之責任與商相之筆禍問題、截爲兩起、使之成爲全然另一問題、聞將根據此項策略、以爲答辯之方針云、（八日日聯電）</p>

<p>蘇聯的國防、本來是可以誇耀於世界的、但是在另一方面Ⅰ遠東問題Ⅰ却顯露出可怕的危機、這就是蘇日問題的嚴重性、就樂觀方面看、蘇日兩國間的懸案、如北洋漁塲的爭執、如煤油問題、都得到了暫時的解决、祗有中東鐵路還是一個橫亘在那裏的重大案件、</p>
<p>依照蘇聯主要負責人所表示的意見、假如日本帝國主義仍舊繼續橫行下去、敢於侵犯蘇聯領土、則蘇聯到那時候、將决不退讓、起而應戰、據此間情勢觀察、日本對此殊無特别的表示、祗有要把旭川第七師團調到滿洲去、要將弘前第八師團的一部分調回日去、總計駐在中東路沿綫的日本部隊、有第十師團全部·第七師團全部·一個砲兵旅·兩個騎兵旅·合計約六萬人光景、再加上在南滿的十四師團·朝鮮二十師團之一部·六個守備大隊·及第六師團之一部、與其他各特科部隊、總計約十四萬人光景、蘇聯方面、自赤塔以至於海參崴、除兩個太平洋軍團、三十五·三十六兩軍團及特科部隊、合計不過十二三萬人、但戰鬭力很强、新式兵器、非常充足、并且蘇方是着重防禦、没有積極進攻的意思、</p>
<p>現在就蘇日雙方軍隊的素質、作個比較、也可以略爲窺察蘇日雙方將來發生戰爭的趨勢、</p>
<p>蘇聯的軍隊、其士兵的來源和徵兵制度、諸國相同、都是由民間來的、特别是由工人和農民當中選出來的、其服役期限爲二年、軍事訓練和各陸軍國、差不多没有什麽兩樣、帝俄時代那些習氣、已剷除殆盡了、尤其特别的、各國所無的是政治訓練、牠的每一個兵、不消說都能够了解他在戰時的任務、│在帝俄時代也未始不明白、但不甚確實、并且私人的嗜好很多、如喝酒之類、頗足以影響其戰鬭力、│現在不然了、訓練在軍事上嚴格確實以外、更加一番政治上的認識、他們知道自已的任務、他們知道爲什麽要打他們的敵人、</p>
<p>在日本的軍隊、軍事的訓練、當然很週到很細密、現世界上任何優秀陸軍國、也并不比牠强些、就軍事的行動而論、赤軍還有不及牠的地方、因爲日本軍國民的敎育傳統、已深入人心、所以一般士兵都能够忠實履行其任務、不過他們在政治上不曾充分注意、甚至於可以講没有政治的訓練、因此就會發生以下的兩大缺點、第一、日本的知識水凖已經逐漸増高、社會科學的研究、并不完全是一時的流行品、而是漸次深入到一般社會的下層羣衆、日本的兵、是從民間來的、他們已經認識現實、不平的思想、已經遍佈在一般人腦子裹、則是忠君愛國這一類的麻醉藥、效騐確已很少、機械式的壓迫、在平時還可以維持、小戰爭短時期、也還可以支撑、一旦遇着大戰、恐怕就會發生變化了、</p>
<p>第二、是生活驅逐的暗示、徵兵不外是在工人和農民當中去挑選的、他們在生活安定的時期、還可以勉强一心報國、開疆拓土、造更好的生活環境、但是現在、日本的農村瀕於破產、一般士兵以至於下級官佐的父母妻子都悽惶於饑餓綫上、朝不保夕城市上也是遭遇盛大的市面不景氣、生活的困難、十分嚴重、所以愛國思想、根本上發生動摇、如果眞正長期作戰、誰能保他們不生變化、（一月二十七日於海參崴）</p>

<p>派關劉兩師恊攻孫軍</p>
<p>促晋閻派隊開拨援寗</p>
<p>北平通訊、北平軍分會委員長何應欽、昨日（五日）下令褫免孫殿英第四十一軍軍長及第四十師師長本兼各職、並電呈軍委會及行政院、所有孫部軍隊、交由于世銘·丁綍庭·劉月亭負責指揮、何應欽恐孫軍依然西進、昨晚在居仁堂邀集華北各將領談話、磋商處置孫軍方法、結果决定、㈠孫殿英如不交出軍權、達抗軍分會命令時、决定按照前擬辦法、由晋綏甘寗靑五省、共同出兵會剿、澈底解决、㈡再派侯成赴晋謁閻、催促晋綏兩省部隊、向寗綏交界出兵、尾轚孫軍、並與閻磋商大兵假道晋綏兩省、㈢必要時、派關麟徵師全部及劉多荃師騎兵團恊助、經平綏路開至包頭集中、聯絡晋綏軍向磴口及黃河套出擊、據官塲消息、孫軍西進目的、在攻佔寗夏、卽長驅西入、當孫軍出發時、其部下曾有向孫建議、謂赴西北如經寗夏、馬軍必阻攔、最好由黃河套西南不經寗邊而進、以免中途發生障碍、俟到沃野後、卽一鼓作氣、衝過寗夏、孫因前者馬鴻逵曾有電阻其西進、頗爲負氣、故對建議者云、我之目的、須先壓倒馬鴻逵始向西進、故對避免寗邊行軍之建議、决不採納、乃由橙口李崗堡各處前進、與馬軍相持二十餘日、馬之援軍、已大部開至、近數日間、前方戰事激烈、實爲衝突以來所未有、孫殿英因當局免其本兼各職、勢必鋌而走險、並計劃於最短期内、攻佔寗夏、如甘寗靑聯軍實力過强不能抵抗、則沿寗夏以北經蒙邊西進、如寗方實力不甚充足、不能抗禦時、則佔寗夏後、看察情勢、繼續西進、對何應欽之五日電、亦不答覆云、</p>
<p>孫殿英被免職後、其主力部隊、現仍在寗夏省垣以北集結、時向城垣猛攻、據歸化電稱、寗夏守軍、爲馬鴻逵部詹旅、孫軍環攻者約萬五千人、平羅確爲孫軍佔領、守平羅旅長馬寳麟陣亡、覆没約四千人、殺戮甚慘、孫軍楊猴小部、觸地雷炸斃七百餘人、閻錫山曾派參議陳家深一度來綏調查孫馬戰况、刻已返并覆命、但今晚軍分會正式否認平羅失守、并公布寗夏來電、謂甘靑各省軍隊、巳向寗夏省垣積極增援、城内之馬鴻逵軍、巳凖備大舉反攻、軍分會對於討伐孫軍、决不下令、因已派于世銘等負責統率整理、如該軍反抗、則由晋綏甘寗靑五省會擊也、</p>
<p>閻錫山之態度、頗堪注意、因綏遠與寗夏毘連、綏遠爲晋軍防守、倘閻與中央一致、孫軍自易解决、聞經此間當局派代表與閻一再商洽、閻已表示與中央一致、並决定派王靖國第七十師·及趙承绶騎兵師、開撥援寗、俟領到中央開拨費、卽可動員、但閻氏向來態度神秘、實際問題、尙待詳細研商也、（四日）</p>

<p>新聲社云、財政部長孔祥熙、鑒於軍政費每月不敷、曾發行民國二十三年關稅庫劵一萬元、以作抵償中央等銀行舊欠之用、今向滬銀行家分别進行新借欵、以意國退回我國庚子賠欵爲担保、今已成立、總數爲四千四百萬元、合同亦已簽字</p>
<h3 id="c131">借欵總數 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>新借欵總數、經新聲社記者昨向各銀行領袖分别調查、知確爲四千四百萬元、外傳四千六百萬元及四千七百萬元、似屬不確、但此次借欵、係由孔部長直接向各大銀行接洽、并未經過銀行業同業公會、</p>
<h3 id="c132">意欵担保 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>

<p>各銀行处認定借欵後、今已開始分别解欵、并規定四個月期解淸、是項意國退回庚子賠欵、係由前財政部長宋子文在意時、與意國政府接洽决定、聞財政部此項借欵成立後、二十三年關稅庫劵、决不再向銀行界抵押、</p>

<p>新新社云、財政部長孔祥熙氏、爲充實國庫起見、現特向本市銀行界進行新借欵、結果頗爲圓滿、借欵總數爲四千四百萬元、係由中央·中國·交通·中南·金城·中國實業·上海·四明·大陸·浙江興業·鹽業·墾業·等十六家銀行、分别承借、以意國退回庚子賠欵作抵、年利六厘、分五年償淸、并聞該項合同業經上星期簽訂、外傳該項借欵利率按月八厘、至民國三十七年止、償淸一節、并非事實云、</p>

<p>詎下車後、病又轉劇、　　口部歪斜、言語艱澀、　　返寓後、竟不能進食、延國醫陸仲安、診治服藥後、病勢稍佳、但言語仍艱澀糢糊、不易辨别、于氏於民國十七年時、曾患同様病症、旋經醫治後逐漸告痊、惟以國事鞅掌、未能多療養、故迄未完全復原、在此次發病之前、于氏口唇本微向右斜</p>

<p>對處置閩變善後感想極佳</p>
<p>中央社云、福建省政府全體委員五日正式就職、中央黨部及國民政府、特派中委王正廷氏、偕秘書樊光、赴閩監誓、王氏業於六日公畢、乘坐寗海艦離閩來滬、已於前晚六時許抵淞口、當卽下艦、换乘小輪進口、九時半許抵新關碼頭登岸、逕返古拔路私邸休息、王氏昨曾接見中央社記者、發表談話如下、</p>
<p>閩省現狀　　據王氏談、閩變敉平後、所有十九路軍殘餘步隊、業已改編、漳泉各地、亦均平定、國軍策略神速、誠可驚人、至該省地方、經此次變亂、上游各地受害頗劇、省垣附近及下游各處、尙不致有巨大影響、惟年來受匪共擾亂、及當地雜色軍隊蹂躪、民生凋敝、幾亦遍地瘡痍、目下第一要着、係在恢復社會秩序、維持地方治安、使人民得安居樂業、漸次開發交通、振興生產、整理財政、當不難次第就緒、現在勦匪之事、已積極切實進行、而公路建築計劃進行甚速、編遺雜軍、聞亦具有規模、閩省氣候極佳、物產豐富、文化素盛、一經整理、善後諸端、當可拭目觀其成也、</p>
<p>對閩感想　　中國現在最要關鍵、在閩贛間勦匪問題、前十九路軍據閩時、對於勦匪一節、絶對不能貫澈、因國軍在贛方雖極力兜勦、而閩方並不恊助、後且與共匪妥洽、故益滋蔓難圖、此次叛軍旣已解散、共匪本亦窮蹙、國軍現已全力從閩方與贛省各軍合力圍攻、匪共勦滅、時間問題耳、此閩省今日之克復、雖係一省、而實則有關於大局甚大、極爲可喜也、閩省北部與浙東交界多山、而富於林木及農產、平日交通不便、貨棄於地、地方貧瘠異常、此次事變以後、當局因感交通之設備與地方關係甚大、故正從事閩北至浙東公路之完成、聞由浦城至建甌、兩月内可以竣工、而由建甌至延平、亦在積極計劃、預計八月可達閩恒、此路一成、則閩北地利可迅速開發、生產亦可運輸出口、閩北且可變爲膏腴富庶之區、此實好現象、陳主席公洽、對於軍事政治、均極有經騐、又肯負責有爲、其省府各廳長委員、亦皆一時之彥、前途極可樂觀也、</p>

<p>昨日雙方代表檢騐兩輪聘定專家公斷肇禍責任　　招商局普安輪、與英商藍烟囱公司之斐臘克太的號互撞、雙方損失頗重、昨日已經各派代表到輪檢視　然後定期公斷、兹將續訊查記如下、</p>
<h3 id="c203">雙方檢騐船舶 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>普安輪與斐臘克　太的號兩船撞碰之後、其第一個重要問題、卽爲肇禍之責任問題、究竟孰是孰非、與雙方損壞的程度、應公同騐定後、可先入廠修理、以免多延時日、故昨晨由招商局會同藍烟囱公司、並知照有關係之保險行等、各派代表、招商局方面爲船舶科正副主任趙雲台·周厚坤·及工程師肇泰保險行之代表、英商方面爲藍烟囱公司大班·及保險行代表·等、總計兩方有十餘人、自上午九時起、卽同赴浦東、公同檢騐兩輪之損壞狀况、歷經五小時之久、</p>
<h3 id="c204">勘明損壞狀况 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>雙方代表係先至藍烟囱碼頭、檢騐英輪斐臘克太的號、其撞碰之</p>
<p>處外舷、鐵板均凹進　、雖輪體受傷、而猶未破裂、各檢騐代表勘明傷勢後、便向船主等盤詰當時肇事經過、船主報告時、各人均筆錄之、次又轉往華棧騐勘普安輪、亦先視船頭撞壞之處、復向船主雷克斯盤問撞碰狀况、至爲詳盡、而歷時甚久、雷克斯所言、亦皆錄記·兩輪檢騐事畢、已在下午各代表始各返滬、</p>
<h3 id="c205">先行入廠修理 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>共同檢騐之第一步乎續告竣、兩輪卽先行入塢修理、蓋免多延時日、則船期損失更大、因外洋輪每天費用連同燃料至少七八百元、普安輪船頭損壞甚大、龍骨亦將改換、需费甚巨、現局方將該輪修理、由滬上各船廠開賬到局、擇其價格低廉而合于需要者、卽要修之、究入何廠　須待明日、方可决定、藍烟囱公司輪亦先由該行自行進塢修理、刻正與各船廠接洽中、此次普安輪修理、至速須兩星期方可竣工、</p>

<p>此次兩輪撞碰、其責任何屬、現在尙難决定、蓋昨日各代表盤詢兩船長　各有是處、亦各有非處、故共同决定由兩　輪公司及保險行公同聘定船舶公斷之西人委員若干人、組公斷處、以訊究此案、記者又叩詢招商局船舶科主任趙雲台氏言、公斷員尙未舉定、大致明日（十號）可以由雙方公决要聘之、滬上要人中之任公斷專職者頗多、但此案無論如何、絶對不移歸航政局之碰撞委員會辦理、因對方係英國船、非我航政局所能受理、而藍烟囱公司亦不贊同歸航政局處分也、</p>

<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>刻下鄙人有一個困難問題，也許社會上有不少人和我表同情的，爲此敢於提出，請貴部加以研究。</p>
<p>鄙人對於國文一門，通常差可應用，對於治學方法以及選擇緊要的書籍閱讀等，自以爲也可稍有理會。不過所苦的不懂英文，又没有涉獵過社會科學書，所以在看新小說時碰到有洋典洋詞，最多也只可有模糊的想像，還有政治學，心理學，哲學方面的術語，舊文學方面的艱深字句，這種種地方，很多是辭源字典，都不能替我解答。他方面我又没有師友，可以問難和質疑，因此上，一有疑團，便難解釋。</p>
<p>這類字句疑難的解釋，未免過於瑣屑，料想必不在貴部指導範圍以内。不過事實擺在我的面前，和我有同感的人，說是很少吧，那便没有問題；若是很多呢，就得費貴部諸位的心神，想法解决。最好貴部能擴大範圍，負起這解答疑難字句的責任來，倘是無暇辦理，或者請諸位想個法子，提出來供給社會採用。</p>
<p>我想這種問題，就是經濟寛裕的人，可以聘師交友來得容易，不過這疑難的字句，門類很多，一二師友，怕還不能完全解答。</p>

<p>（香港四日通訊）本港足球總會、爲檢閱行將赴滬比賽之埠際選手隊實力起見、特於昨日約華人聯隊戰於九龍會球塲、在數千觀衆視綫之下、大戰九十分鐘、　英萃薈之選手隊、竟不能勝陣勢薄弱之華聯、五對五和局而終、足見總會之人選問題、仍未能　完善、而將來在滬比賽、殊難抱樂觀也、</p>

<p>埠際選手隊陣勢、實由各隊挑出一等健將組成、再經數次練習、始由人選委員意見鄭重編定、理應實力强勁、陣勢完整、華聯隊不過由南華中華兩隊選出、且好手已被埠際隊徵三三人、則兩隊比較、其實力顯有强弱之分矣、</p>

<p>然而昨日之戰、反見華隊佔優、蓋足球總會歷次人選、頗有情面存乎其間、昨日上半時之陣勢、前鋒綫無甚疵議、中後衛綫之派路卑路曾史杜蘭治（隊長）三人、實難附止華隊鐵騎馳驟、門將麥哈地確屬次等人才、何足勝任、下半時準備對津之陣線、更屬疲弱異常、利安　依待必列顚等輩、實爲甲組中之弱者、而竟選之爲埠際代表、總會人選委員眼光、誠未有獨到處也、華隊昨日表演殊佳、雖劉茂黃紀良梁現贊不出、各人亦能盡其長、假使李國祖稍爲鎭定、不負一三兩球、則華隊當佔勝利矣、茲雙方陣勢照列於下、</p>

<p>今日兩塲美迪那出塲</p>
<p>十五臨别表演在西靑</p>
<p>世界職業擊彈名家威利史密斯之神妙技術、在過去兩日表演中、曝露無遺、大受觀衆歡迎、上海吳巿長昨特偕兪秘書長及張廷榮秘書等作壁上觀、每逢精彩之處、或點首示意、或鼓掌讚嘆、時與兪秘書長低聲細語、加以評斷、意吳巿長亦老於　道者乎、比賽旣終、此著名職業家急趨謝吳巿長莅臨之盛意、並希予以指導、吳巿長獎勵之餘、又祝其藝與日進、上海擊彈事業、經此番吳巿長之欣賞、是將趨向勃興之預兆也、</p>
<h3 id="c254">今日兩場 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>今日爲史密斯在聯華總會表演之末一日、其九時一刻之對手、爲葡人美迪那、滬上著名業餘家之一、與我國李公頴並肩稱王、値得一觀、下午六時英人康卜斯出塲、康氏英僑中之佼佼者、前後兩塲、均有驚人表演、</p>

<p>７４—５１　章華雖强祗能支持五分鐘</p>
<p>麥令表演之美妙出乎意外</p>
<p>海賊已得甲一部優勝</p>
<p>章華對麥令之上海籃球甲二部决賽、昨晚千在餘觀衆包圍中之中華籃球房舉行、麥令之表演、出神入化、章華僅於開首之五分鐘内、略佔優先、入後一蹶不振、控制無方、麥令身材高大、行動敏捷、傳遞優美、投籃尤見凖確、章華錢敬鏞之目光雖凖、但投射無機、上半時以二十二比四十一落後、總結果成七十四比五十一、海賊已完成甲一部秩序、昨勝猶太、易如反掌、將靜候甲二部之優勝、作錦標之逐鹿、</p>
<h3 id="c258">精彩表演 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>前五分鐘之表演、精彩百出、章華一鼓作氣、聲勢浩浩、大有不可一世之槪、極能聯絡、出奇制勝、但自十二比十二後、麥令奇峯突起、銳不可當、章華防禦不能遏制其鋒芒、孫寳慶嫌矮、陸鍾恩招顧不了、陳祥龍一再放縱洛克溜進、勢成狂瀾、球至敵手、瞬息卽至籃下、三鋒包圍、十九中的、章華陳祥龍奔走較遲、與馮錢尙難合拍、更以中間跳球、無法搶得、故球勢始終屈居下風、</p>
<h3 id="c259">黃金時代 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>上塲陸鍾恩首開紀錄後、連續出兩次犯規、心中不免一急、同時麥令之别許潑、亦連犯兩次、可謂無獨有偶、茂雷罰陸鍾恩、錢敬鏞罰别許潑、各加一分、成三比一、樂愛造成三比三、麥令呌息、别許潑操後路襲進、加上二分、麥令乃以五比三佔先、陸鍾恩前進策應、籃前六碼妙中、錢敬鏞二次角球、神妙非凡、九比五爲章華之黃金時代、表演之佳、堪嘆歐觀止矣　、</p>
<h3 id="c260">漸趨平衡 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>麥令鋒芒漸起、大有咄咄逼人之槪、章華因中間跳球之不利、屢吃大虧、初陳祥龍阻洛克之投籃、球中又被罰、連失三分成九比八、錢敬鏞再中、陳祥龍加一分、成十二比八、仍佔優先、别許潑籃前十碼兩次遥中、成十二比十二、從此章華之黃金時代過去矣、先前章華之堅持奮鬥、屢佔上風者、因守衛之尙能遏制敵鋒耳</p>
<h3 id="c261">良辰不再 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>花好不常、良辰不再章華戰略仍無變化、陸鍾恩不時猶上前助前鋒之不足、以致後方時陷空虚、及至投籃不中、球落敵手後、麥令兩鋒、一個箭步、已躥至籃下、章華返奔不及、於是球如串珠、一失再失、麥令連增十分、馮念華方開其本人紀錄、樂克左右開弓、任何部位均能投籃、從此形勢懸殊、章華於得失之間、相差一倍、上半時麥令四十一分、章華二十一分、</p>
<h3 id="c262">局勢懸殊 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>再戰聲起、馮念華漸見起見、麥令樂愛與别許潑退、易以勃利士及届拉柯、勃利時兩發兩中、章華力圖掙扎、馮念華較上半時活潑多多、兩球連中、錢敬鏞亦加一分、手法眼光、極見純熟凖確、三球連中、不滿一分鐘、局勢似乎又有起色、三十比四十五、相差十五分、實則難矣、况麥令氣焰未减、霎時間勃利士茂雷又連加十分、自此章華常落後二十分外、</p>
<h3 id="c263">大勢已定 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>勢成狂瀾、局面已定、麥令仍不時調將、章華亦時起時落、亦曾一度連得八分之多、但得不償失、三十八比五十六、相去仍有十八分、樂克茂雷、錦上添花、成六十六比三十八、差二十八分之多、此後局勢漸衰、觀衆互作鳥獸散、塲面頓有混亂氣象、章華　最後掙扎、加至五十一分、麥令則爲七十四分、時間遂終、</p>
<h3 id="c264">得其所哉 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>章華之敗、初不料失分若是之多、然章華之表演、尙稱美妙、所缺奔跑傳遞、尙嫌遲緩、麥令之勝、自有其特殊技衛、章華實相差尙遠　西靑籃球海賊之　敗麥令、全在塲面狹小、不够麥令之活動、今章華旣敗、麥令可隠得甲二部優勝、日後麥令海賊再遇、海賊必嫌塲面闊大、而無所用其技倆、麥令將得錦標矣、</p>

<h3 id="c272">馬如飛的幽默 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>古歷歲尾前數日，說書先生總動員，在城廂内外各書塲大做其會書生涯；就中，說小書的談起着前輩先生馬如飛，總想起着大拇指，說是唱書界中唯一無二的泰斗。</p>
<p>余生也晚，不及聽到馬如飛的高妙彈詞；但，在童年聽那曾经聽過馬如飛彈詞的老單先生傳述，覺得馬如飛的幽默論調倒也可以算得東方的蕭伯訥。偶爾憶及，略述如左：</p>
<p>馬如飛遇見一生客，互問尊姓，馬云：「奇哉。」馬知客人開頑笑，把奇字諧音騎字，未免惡謔。因問客云：「尊大人康健否？」客言：「尙健。」又問：「尊堂呢？」客言：「不幸失恃。」馬連連嗟歎云：「奇煞哉！」客不禁大窘。</p>
<p>馬如飛說書時，號召力很大，書塲中往往人頭擠擠。塲東見利忘義，以多報少，餘者盡入私囊，其名呌做「吃人頭。」馬知之，故作不知，唱畢下臺，和塲東談寒喧客套；先問塲東：「貴體如何？」塲東云：「托福，窮健。」馬又問：「飲食如何？」塲東云：「每餐兩碗。」馬連連叮囑云：「吃要當心。」塲東的面皮上，立時烘烘地熱。</p>
<p>馬如飛有一種脾氣，塲子做得太久了，便喜出些亂子，一打散塲。馬在三萬昌唱書時，聽客中有一少年，是水利廳的兒子，專在塲中胡閙，不但聽衆厭惡，馬亦鄙視其人，一日，馬在揷科中講一笑話，略云：「海龍王在水晶宮中演講龍藏眞经，所有一切水族，須得凖時入宮聽講，違者，拒諸門外。其時，水族一一報到，惟有龜步蹣跚，錯過時刻，比及扒到水晶宮，宮門已緊閉了。龜無奈，只得伏在水中守候。少頃，講经完畢，宮門開放，龜乃蹣跚上殿。龍王駡道：「你這烏龜，爲什麽不聽講经？」龜云：「小子聽的。」龍王道：「你在那裏聽？」龜云：「小子在水裏聽。」揷科至此，聽客都向着水利廳的兒子好笑。其人大怒，揮拳捋臂，把塲子打得落花流水，塲東呌苦，馬如飛郤在稱快。</p>
<h3 id="c273">某夫人 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 芋山</p>
<p>某夫人，我忘了伊的姓。不過伊總是某先生的夫人，某五個孩子的母親就是了。</p>
<p>某夫人的父親，是一個道地的秀才，所以，夫人從小就受到那些「好」敎育。</p>
<p>伊父親知道：「女子無才便是德」，於是夫人到現在，祗認識西瓜般大的二三擔字·伊父親知道：女子要有「在從四德」·於是整天的把夫人關在「閨房」裏，不許出來。</p>
<p>夫人到先生家裏，是那一年，我記不起了。就是夫人自己也記不起了·不過，夫人到了先生家裏，從没吵過嘴，並且生了五個孩子，兩個女的，三個男的，肚中一個，不知道是男，是女。</p>
<p>夫人雖然没讀過書，也識得幾個字，而且，這許多字，對於夫人都是切於實用的，像：「馬將」牌裏的東，南，西，北，中，發，春，夏，秋，冬，一，二，三，……九。「花會」裏的什麽方茂林呀，田伏桑呀…………伊都是很熟悉，就是閉了眼，伊也想得出：田字是方方的，方字却不是方方的，不但如此，伊又知道：方茂林是和尙，田伏桑是狗。其餘，夫人都知道，在下只知道這些，假使諸位要知道的話，可以去問夫人。</p>
<p>夫人的才學是這樣·夫人的本領亦大得可以：能够帶着四歲的孩子，抱着二歲的女兒，身上更懷着在肚中已經七個月的孩子，去义「馬將」。假使把伊每日的工作列成一張表的話，那麽你看了，凖會舌撟不下。</p>
<p>「上午八時起身，先同孩子穿衣，洗臉，然後自己洗，洗罷。同生生預備面水，已九時矣。後與四歲的孩子，二歲的女兒，到小菜塲買菜，歸家就燒飯，一面收拾房間，收拾好，燒菜，一面孩子吵吃·千辛萬苦的燒好飯，吃罷·與鄰家嫂嫂，對門姆媽，亭子間師母，作「竹城」之戲，十二圈，廿四圈，日繼以夜，夜飯來不及燒，吃麵·」</p>
<p>夫人每日工作大槪如此，伊不用娘姨·理由是：一·娘姨要錢，又要吃飯。二·恐娘姨「揩油」，報虚賬，三·甚爲討厭。</p>
<p>一二八戰後，就没有再見過夫人，不知道伊到那裏去了。</p>

<p>第二十四回</p>
<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡含别淚</p>
<p>挑燈温夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>趙翁在對面屋子裏，聽到兒子哈哈大笑，很有些莫明其妙，伸頭在房門口看時，只見新房的門簾低垂，裏面的聲音又寂然了。心裏想着，少年人究竟是少年人，這樣新婚從軍的離别，那裏是人禁受得起的，然而他們糊裏糊塗的還取笑作樂呢。過了許久，才聽到夫妻雙雙的出來了，原來是議好了，出去買作餡餅的作料，走到了前院時，那笑聲還送到後院子裏來，自然他們是高興極了的了。半小時工夫，自强進來了，臉上依然帶了愁容。趙翁道，你在那裏來。自强道：他要作餡餅我吃，又要我同他一塊兒去買作料，我只好陪着，其實我不想吃什麽。說時懶懶的在一張椅子上坐下。趙翁道：他那樣子很高興，是你說將來要接他出去吧？自强沉吟了一會子道：也許是……說畢，長長的歎了一口氣。門簾子一掀，桂枝笑着跳了進來，向趙翁道：爹，我作餡兒餅您吃，好嗎？趙翁點點頭。桂枝笑道：自强明天要走了，我給他餞行呢，打一點兒酒喝，好嗎？趙翁看他那樣子，果然十分的高興，便笑道：照說呢可以讓他喝一杯餞行酒兒。只是他明天一早就要去趕早班車，喝多了，可起不了床呢。桂枝笑道：今天晚飯喝酒，明天早上還醒不了，這得喝上一罎子吧？說着，向自强眼皮一撩道：你能喝多少，我們可約定了的。說畢，笑着去了。趙翁看他如此，却是不解。自强笑道：他完全是小孩子脾氣，他說今晚晌和我坐着談到天亮。趙翁道：你可别閙孩子脾氣，到了濼州，還得走道呢。天氣凉了，長城一帶，我想比這兒冷吧？（二四二）</p>

<p>— 金孑</p>
<p>因爲我是一個最貪生怕死的人，所以每次逢到身體上有些不舒服的時候，便急不及待的去找醫生，走進去第一名話往往總是：「先生，我這個毛病會死嗎」？結果是不但至今不曾死，而且因爲治得早的緣故，連正正式式的大毛病也不曾害過一次。</p>
<p>但是現在，我却已害了一種很可憐的毛病，就是所謂「失眠症」。不久以前，似乎我曾經在某報上看見過一篇題名「都巿病」的方章，其中也有「失眠症」三個字：不錯，失眠症確然是和都巿中人最易發生關係的一種毛病，因爲失眠症的病源無論如何總跳不出戀愛和經濟的兩層問題，而都巿中人偏是整天的鑽在這兩層問題裏翻觔斗，若是而欲求其不失眠，尙可得乎！</p>
<p>不過我之所以失眠，却旣不爲戀愛，也不爲經濟，而是爲了幾件夾夾雜雜小問題難以解决，不覺思慮過度，遂致失眠；現在且置我的失眠理由而不談。單話失眠後的情况。</p>
<p>不知道那一夜是怎樣被驚醒的，時鐘上的短針還没有到十一點，而我的睡意竟是完全消失了：我先是毫不介意的靜靜地躺着，過了一個多鐘頭，還是不能睡熟，我猛可記了書上的話，便默默地數着一，二，三，四，五，六……不料越數越見精神，幾乎連床也躺不住　了：於是再取第二步行動，趕快起床，用熱水洗足，洗得足上的皮膚齊透了紅色，我想這樣一下子湧在腦部裏的血液總該下去了，忙鑽進被窩去再躺，豈知還是没有用，到底輾轉反側的一直挨到了天色大明。第二天便來不及的去找醫生。不料醫生說：「失眠無藥可治，祗有自已約束思想」。哎呀！這可糟了！*</p>
<p>大凡一個人要强迫他不吃　品，專吃白飯，也許還辦得到；就是要强迫他整天閉上眼皮，不看一件東西，也遠不見得</p>
<p>怎樣難；惟有要强迫他不思想，那是萬萬辦不到的。我當時很怪那醫生爲什麽不替我開方子，尤其是害怕這個無藥可治的失眠症也許會斷送我的命，便憤憤然地去買了一瓶安眠藥片；但是那藥房裏的伙計，却有一片絶好的心，再三叮嚀我最好不要吃，他倒並不怕我自殺，而是怕我吃了要成癮。于是我就只能不吃，至今還是在失眠的痛苦中掙扎。</p>

<h3 id="c276">製臘肉楓魚法 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 紀于</p>
<p>時當三冬，節届歲臘。居户人家，趁着這時候，大可以製些臘肉楓魚。倘使立了春做，就要出毛病。記得在某一年，那時已經立春過後，吾家裏醃了幾隻腿，豈知到了立夏邊，肉裏爬出許多小黑虫來，我就此不敢吃。所以醃肉一定要在臘月裏。</p>
<p>先講製臘肉：到肉店上揀選肥大的後腿幾　，（最好吃豆餅的猪）拿回來放在敞口缸裏，手上套一隻新蒲鞋，（用手擦亦可但很痛）用鹽一把，在皮上重擦，如是者數次，，要擦得肉皮上發出汗來，方始停止；然後翻轉來再擦裏面的精肉，也要多擦。末了，再擦脚椿脚爪，那用鹽的分量，是一大脚肉十兩至十二兩，不能過淡；等到幾脚肉一起擦好，把他平放在缸裏，掇幾塊洗凈的大石，壓在上面。到了明天，往肉店裏去討一小碗硝露，倒在缸裏。以後每天要把肉上下翻一個身，掉一個頭。過了三個多星期，把缸裏的肉拿出來，每隻紥上草繩，掛在廊簷下曬，傍晚，拿下來浸在缸裏，壓上石塊，明天取出再曬，曬了七八個太陽，把肉一起掛在陰風處，聽其自然。如果再曬下去，肉就要發老。等到筍巿裏，斬一大塊，和筍白燒；或者放到六月裏吃，都可以，味道的美，無有復加：因爲這個臘肉，實在比火腿比南加香肉都好吃，又鮮又嫩。</p>
<p>再講做楓魚法：在陰歷十二月二十左右，買十餘斤活的大鯖魚一兩條，拿回來殺好，（不要洗不要去鱗）挖去肚裏的東西，剖爲兩爿，（頭尾不用另外燒來吃整個魚頭用火腿冬笱淸煮味道絶佳并且頭裏有許多的腦子）切成叚頭，每叚兩面用鹽略擦，放在大缽或小缸裏，擦一叚，放一叚；等到一起擦完舒齊，在魚面上壓幾塊小石，使他並緊，不可露出個孔隙，恐怕猫要偷來吃。到了正月半邊，把魚拿出，用紥鞋底綫一爿一爿的穿起，掛在竹竿上，曬五六個太陽，然後掛在透風處，到二月初十左右，把魚取下，洗凈去鱗，切成方塊，（不切也好）用毛巾吸去水分，在太陽裏略曬。收下，放在磁的大獅子缸内，沽高梁酒若干，倒在缸裏，那酒的分量多少，要差不多浸到魚面上。那時還可以工切幾塊臘肉片，放在裏面；再買酒釀若干，舗在上面，多少隨意，如果魚裏面要放花椒的，可以放上八九粒，不放也好。那時把蓋蓋好，外面用洋皮紙封固。等到端陽節邊，拿幾塊放在碗裏，加些葱，在飯鑊上燉來吃？眞的别有風味，那魚又香又酥，很可以下飯，不下於巿上的楓魚，而且價格裏面，又便宜得多咧　！</p>

<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>汕地近海，水產極多，於此極多之水產中，蠔爲其著名之一種。採蠔者類多汕地附近之村民；雖非成羣結隊，然亦時常彼此結伴，於海旁一帶之石塊及碼頭之基柱上鑿取。蠔本貝類，寄生於隣水之石塊與木柱上，鑿者俟潮退時，只須以鐡片，鑿去其殼，則可取出蠔肉；然亦有將蠔與殼全行鑿下，盛之以桶，携近家中從容挖開蠔殼者。</p>
<p>挖出之蠔肉，呈乳白色，其質柔軟有如棉花。也覺淸甜可口，因其無血，戒殺生者，多取以助膳，推爲無上食品。</p>
<p>（註）　「蠔煎」潮人多呼「蠔劣」，「劣」字取音；余因便利起見，取其義而呼之曰「蠔煎」。</p>

<p>日米來華傾銷之必然性</p>
<h3 id="c280">日政府抱定蝕本做去 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>我中國難望阻其不來</p>
<p>自日本有將其剩米來華傾銷之說，本巿糧食業及政府當局均已引起注意，發表談話，以爲日米或無來華傾銷之可能性，本報記者日前特爲此事，往訪專事研究民食問題之某君，據其所談及出示日本台灣朝鮮各米進口量値之統計，則日米之來華傾銷，雖曰米價低廉，仍恐有其可能也，某君之言曰，</p>
<p>「日本自施行统統制米榖法以來，已露捉襟見肘之狀，蓋人工雖曰萬能，而如在自然界嚴重壓迫之下，尙多缺陷，蓋米榖法之最感因難者，卽公定價格之規定以及米價之維持是也，其維持之辦法，卽由政府出資收買，姑不論收買之後，作何處置，卽收買之際，滾滾而來，政府能有此力量與否，戛然而止，不無更貽民衆以惡感，源源收買，財力將有時而不繼，故日米如果確屬豐收，自非另尋出路不可，否則日政府亦難爲此大囤户也。據現狀以觀，日議會如此質問，以及日内閣之皇皇謀補救，此過剩之米一千萬石，存留於日本國内，日米更無看好之機會，與其顧惜此一千萬石剩米之損失，而使米價陷於不能維持之地步，釀成農民暴動，内閣倒閉，寗忍痛犠牲，將此一千萬石剩米處置淸楚，轉使日本農民得慶蘇息，而日政府亦可稍紓收買剩米之苦痛也。</p>
<p>日本台鮮米之來華傾銷，其途徑不外有四，一卽方爲日僞占領下之東三省，東三省有時仰賴鮮米接濟，且以土壤相接，鮮滿雜處，彼此之有無調節，本屬慣事，今在日人占踞之下，堂奥洞開，傾銷更不成題，其次爲華北之天津等處，以有日租界之關係，活動　自形便利，年來天津商帮向上海採辦粳米，數不在少，正爲日本米推銷之機會，至長江方面，本爲產米之區，傾銷原不易，但吾國米產銷絶無統計，故今日米價之貴與賤，是否爲米之本身問題，抑農民經濟破產，不能儲藏而盡以提供巿塲，致陷米價於不振地步之故，如其爲此，則一時之米賤，或至今年二三月之後，卽有回翔之望，假使米價一高，日米卽有乘機侵入之可能，届時爲其傾銷之樞紐，自爲日艦日輪聚泊之上海，至閩粤兩省，本爲洋米之銷地，尤以閩之泉漳福州各地，地狹民稠，在台灣未割於日以前，臺米卽爲閩省唯一之供給，及臺灣割於日，經日人之努力開墾，加以一年兩熟之收穫，米產增加頗速，逈非淸領時代可比，卽最近十年來，增加亦多，一九二四年爲五百六十八萬石，至一九三三年已爲八百三十六萬石，日本又將其本國米種，移植臺灣，藉以改良，卽所謂「蓬萊米」是也，日本又視福建爲其勢力範圍，故日政府以台灣米傾銷於閩粤，駕輕就熟，必可望其成功也。</p>
<p>就上述情形，以爲觀察，除長江流域目下尙難操勝算外，華南華北，可操左券，或謂日米之價貴，來華推銷，必至虧損，此其見解，於平日則當，非常時期則不然，日米在目下，已處於非常時期中，剩米不出銷，一切無辦法，願受虧損已在日政府預算之中，卽運銷於長江一帶及華北各商埠者，其損失由日政府負担之，台灣米傾銷之損失，則由台民及台灣政府均分塡補之，其决心幹去，已可想見，况日本國内米價，所以高於我中國者，亦以其容量較我國爲大也。我國現以公石計算，（巿石亦同量）日米一石，約當一公石八公斗有奇，卽以滬上米價每公石八元計之，折合日米一石之價，應爲十四元四角，以一一二合日幣，則爲十六元一角有零，日米質地以又較粳米爲好，故滬上米價高，日米卽有傾銷之可能，何况旣言傾銷，但求脫售，其他自所不計矣。</p>
<p>有謂自洋米徵稅，滬上洋米久已絶跡，日米卽使進口，終難與本米爭，不知閩粤兩省，固早除外，卽使閩粤地方徵稅，滬津海關徵稅，日人仍能挾其特殊勢力，設法避免，卽不然，亦必能避重就輕，不觀夫關稅甚重之日貨，日人仍能用其徵妙之運輸術，輸入中國仍占優勢，則傾銷之日米旣由政府主持於上，勢必用全力以圖之，關稅不能阻其不來，民衆何能抗其進口，日米之來，正指顧間耳，會觀其後。（表長從略）</p>

<p>巿面曾一度傾瀉</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份巿呈一致鬆落之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌七八角不等、坎拿大跌一角半左右、且以政府麥續有拋售、廠家已有吃進、有此環境之中、人心遂不能擯持、開價時、巿氣跌度尙少、後以大小廠一致脫手、巿面卽見傾瀉、迨至下午開盤、巿面大致盤旋、本月份阜豐脫手、遠期則福新出檔、惟均限價交易、故巿面反呈定勢耳、至本月份粉阜豐照抽、餘則照標凖或加或去、未見一致、結果二三月份均較跌一分半、四月份跌一分七厘半、五六月份跌二分、七月份跌一分七厘半云、</p>

<p>自由談說小品文  曄子　　近年來可以說是小品文盛行的時代，因爲盛行，所以加以研究的人也不少，結論也有種種，看不起牠的人當然也是有的，那不消說，定是善於做大品文的人了。漢朝的王充著「論衡」八十五篇，可稱一部大書，每篇文辭，也很緊富，他在「自紀」中說：「寡言無多，而華文無寡。爲世用者，百篇無害：不爲用者，一章無補。如皆爲用，則多者爲上，少者爲下。累積千金，比於一百，孰爲富者？蓋文多勝寡，財寡愈貧。世無一卷，吾有百篇；人無一字，吾有萬言，孰者爲賢？」這幾名話，已判定了大品文和小品文的優劣，今日的批評家，實　在很可以引用一番的。　　不過，王充是站在作者的立塲說話的，凡作者，總喜歡作品多，文章長，因爲這可以證明他的天才之偉大，學問之淵博，正如「累積千金」之可以炫富。然而，論起用途來，浪擲千金，未必勝於善用百金，同樣，洋洋的大文，未必勝於短短的小品。博士買驢，書券三紙，不見驢字，播爲笑談，足見大文章也有無用武之地之時。而小品文，有時却有很大的效果。　　我可以舉出一個例來。前幾天的報紙上，有這樣一則新聞：　　「粤省今冬奇寒。甘芋等收成，大受損碍。道有餓殍貧民之無寒衣者，至　　感痛苦。廣州曾降雪，此爲稀有事。羅浮山現積雪數寸，景色殊佳。」　　這雖只寥寥六十餘字，但是非常明白，非常自然地指出現代社會的矛盾：在同一個冬天，一部分人因無寒衣至感痛苦，而另一部分人，則因積雪數寸，覺得「景色殊佳」。同時，又指出了現代的某一種人有着兩個靈魂，一個靈魂使他看到飢餓者的痛苦，另一個靈魂使他回頭去欣賞雪景。但這並不是社會主義者的有意的宣傳，而不過是一個新聞記者的寫實。他的寫此六十餘字，只爲忠實地報告一個消息，並非有意批評社會。然而，在無意之間，這個社會的眞相，被他分明地暴露出來了。　　倘有大才的文豪，洋洋灑灑地做一篇萬言的現代社會不平論出來，我想對於讀者效果，未必會比那六十餘字更大些。而且我們還常看到許多文章，因爲要做得長，便彎彎曲曲的說來說去，反而不自覺地說得自相矛盾，使讀者看不出一個所以然。　　因此，我以爲文章的好壞，與大小實在没有關係。王充的話，應改爲「爲世用者，一章無害。不爲用者，百篇無補。」陶公是否農夫耶？  孤雲　　我上次因讀曹聚仁先生文，偶談陶淵明的事。昨讀二月五日自由談，承曹先生惠答且辱引爲「陶黨」中人，君房語妙天下，爲之妨俊不禁。甚感曹先生的意思。凡事只要引起問題，便須徵集佐證。陶公已死多年。曹先生說他「不與農民爲伍」：而我說他是個「會作詩的農夫」。要定此讞，非「掉書袋」不可了。但我的書箱全在北方。說來慚愧，上海寓中一本書没有。若想跑到很遠的圖書館中搜查，在十年前有此「痰氣」，現在被生活壓斷了脊梁，已不容如此風雅了。今日向友人處借來三本不全的陶集，聊寫此首奉質曹先生。恐怕有許多錯誤。因手下無書比如軍中無械，這仗我不敢打。若能因我微末一言，抛磚引玉，有别位博雅君子願意來談談，那我將縮手引爲殊榮。　　現在繹曹先生答文之意，而抒我的引申的話：　　我前文略引陶詩以爲陶公躬耕之證。曹先生答文以論世知人的方法，談到東晋社會亂離，農村蕭條，而深以陶詩忽視這農村的暗影爲怪。不錯。但不能據此以反證陶不是農夫。現在中國農村的暗影比東晋更甚。現在的農夫不了解農村的幾於没有例外。然而他們作了農夫還是農夫。陶公之所不同於一般農夫的，乃是他爲一個儒者詩人的農夫。他是一個獨善其身的人。忽視普遍的農村暗影誠哉有之。因爲他除却儒者思想之外，其餘都和普通農人一樣。他不曾放開眼界對農村作普遍的表現。但他詩文中所述貧苦勞累的情形，正是農村具體的一角，與曹先生所論並無不合。　　關於陶的飲酒，游覽我前文已言是勞動後的休息。　　他的桃花源的夢想，正足以說明他。「其中往來種作，男女衣著，悉如外人，黄髮垂髫並怡然自樂。……自云先世避秦時亂，率妻子邑人來此絶境」。　　「桑竹垂餘蔭，菽稷隨時藝。春蠶收長絲，秋熟靡王稅」。這正是陶的「象牙之宮」。而我竊以爲這正是一個好農夫在亂世苛政之下的痛苦反映，痛苦之餘乃夢想這個「靡王稅」的「絶境」。陶公一生並未在「象牙宮」中往過一日也。　　曹先生文收處，言及前年武漢人民爲魚，而有月夜浮舟挾妓蕭歌者。其言痛絶。曹先生感於斯世而作此言。我與曹先生悲慨正屬一致。並且相信陶公假使猶生，一定也深惡痛絶。因爲陶公吃的苦只有比曹先生和我多。我們所爲悲憤者陶對之决無例外。　　現在請循其本。陶淵明究竟是否農夫耶？　　陶淵明當然不是一生下來就作了農夫，而是解組之後下了决心「轉變」（恕我用這個時髦的辭）作農夫的。如是以至於死。昭明序陶集卽有「……貞志不休，安道苦節。不以躬耕爲恥，不以無財爲病。」之言，而其爲陶作傳亦云，「……親老家貧，起爲州祭酒。不堪吏職，少日自解歸。州召主簿，不就。躬耕自資，遂抱赢疾……」顏延年靖節徵士誄云，「……於是乎遂灌畦鬻蔬，爲供魚菽之祭；織絇緯蕭，以充糧粒之費」。然而這些别人的話，還只能作旁證。　　試更於陶公自身求其直證。祭從弟敬遠文云「…每憶有秋，我將其刈。」自祭文云，「自余爲人，逢運之貧。簞瓢屢罄，絺綌冬陳。含歡谷汲，行歌負薪。翳翳柴門，事我宵晨。春秋代謝，有務中園。載耘載耔，迺育廼繁。欣以素牘，和以七絃。冬曝其日，夏濯其泉。勤靡餘勞心有長閑」「有會而作」的序云，「舊糓旣没，新糓未登。頗爲老農，而値年災。日月尙悠，爲患未已。…」這都是他自己生活的寫照。他詩中「勤農」一首，舉出舜禹冀缺沮溺等等聖賢猶且躬耕，呌衆人不可「曳裾拱手。」呌衆人要勤，不要宴安。可以認作他的理論。歸田園居最後一首云，「…種苗在東　，苗生滿阡陌。雖有荷鋤倦，濁酒聊自適」和劉柴桑云，「…茅茨已就治，新疇復應畬。」一更試看兩首詩的題目：一個是「庚戌歲九月中於西田穫曱　，」一個是「丙辰歲八月中於下潠田舍穫。」這兩首詩更詳述他自己耕作的辛勞，一種勤苦收穫的喜悅是不可貎爲的。這是他理論的實現。　　　正言已畢，請更進一步推求陶公身爲農夫，吃了許多苦，又是思想卓絶的人，何以竟忽視當時的農村暗影呢？前文曾言陶公受用的是儒家思想。儒的流别也多啦。陶公受用的是儒家的一條最基本的狹路。梁任公曾論陶公是孔子所謂「獊者」一流人。及其晚年，則功行圓滿而有自得之樂。（憶商務書館出版梁著陶淵明小冊子中有此言。）我是同情任公此說的。他是一個最剛潔的人。這種人的特性就是範圍往往不容易寛廣。他固窮，力作。檀道濟送他粱肉，那怕正是在肚子餓得　翻了的時候，也是不屑一顧的。顏延之是老朋友，送他二萬錢。好了收下罷。拿去買酒玩玩可以的。但是决不拿去當家私用的。他在當時污亂的士流之中，倔强的作了一個不隨俗轉獨善其身的鐡漢。爲達到這條人格獨立的目的│他自己所說的不层不求│便以躬耕爲達到這目的的手段。一切的飢寒困苦的重圍他都突出了，最後他得到人格獨立的愉快。他一生精力完全用在這上面。所以他至終是一個獨善其身的人。因此，他忽視一般的農村現象，並不是意外。　　現時代的人，是否還要作一個完全和淵明一樣的人，那是另一個問題。大多數頭腦淸楚的人恐怕都不願提倡完全和陶一樣的人了。我們以陶淵明還之陶淵明，則淵明似是如此。　　最後謝謝曹先生惠答之情！在星加坡  黑婴星加坡！赤道上的巴黎。　　我跳上岸，抬起腦袋，一座摩天建築物站立在我的眼前。順着蜂窠似的窗子一層一層往上望；揷在摩天樓頂的是大不列顚帝国的旗幟啊！　　無軌電車，汽車，摩托卡，………横來直去，在我的耳朶邊嚮着金屬的囂音。　　黄包車夫嚷着。││這被祖国遺忘了的黄包可憐虫呵！戴着破帽子，半裸着上身，汗水直從額角上瀉下來，毒辣的太陽晒得他們的皮膚發痛：可是誰去理會呢？　　印度警察在他們的後邊揮着木棒。黄包車夫是常常挨打的：在人們的眼中像已经不是人了。　　舉起「丁」字鋤頭的　寗人，全身烏黑，喘着氣。一下又一下地鋤着柏油路。汽車在他們的身旁擦過去，呼呼地，一陣濃烟從屁股上噴出來，帶着油味。　　給黄包車拉到「南天」住下來。在荒漠得可以的赤道上，星加坡確不能不算是巴黎了。瞧！　　摩天樓。雄偉的郵政總局。銀行。…　　東方有名的影戲院Ｃａｐｉｔａｌ。新世界遊藝塲。南天大酒樓。………　　帝国主義侵入到這裏來已经不少時候了。工廠的黑烟成天直冒。可是，经濟恐慌有加無减的今日，星加坡自然也無法繁榮下去。　　我瞧見那麽多的空舖子，那魔麽多的失業工人。我也瞧見印度警察抓住小偷毆打。晚上呢，當新世界的燈火輝煌之際，空舖子的門前就有無數餓肚皮的人在受着飢凍。他没有暖和的被窩，没有錢，没有家！………　　天啊，我能够說什麽呢？　　我祗是一個過路人呵！　　跳舞塲在星加坡也開設起來了。社會究竟是矛盾的；一方面有人餓肚皮，另一方面却也有人飲香檳，跳舞。　　『管他呢，今天我還有錢的時候我就跳舞去！』　　我的一個朋友那麽說。　　於是爵士的狂歡隠隠地從華美的舞塲裏漏出來，三兩個乞丐在門外酷候着。紳士們來了，便追上去：　　『做做好事………』　　　没說完，已经跑了進去。　　我在這裏彳亍了一些時候，終於走了。　　離開星加坡是一個細雨綿綿的黄昏，嗚地一聲兒，船一步一步地動了。我獨自在甲板上，望着密密的燈火，摩天樓的陰影，彿彷有萬千支利箭揷在我的心上。　　我說不出一句話來。　　我祗是一個過路人呵！我詛咒你那麽一笑　（二）  吳嚴　　「到夷方麽？那危險，誰也不會回來了。」　　自然要尋根究底問下去，而回答的話是。　　「你說爲什麽？你會給那裏的女人抓着哪！」　　意思就是說滇缅滇暹交界間，有一種夷人，女的要比漢人姑娘，好看些，容易誘惑人些。�話雖是不免過份一點，但含義却有一部份是對的。　　這些下山谷來過夜的夷家婦女，多半是││似乎簡直照例是，先到我們這家店子來。實在住滿了，才到老劉的店子去。其餘的店子，却很少有去住的。這並不是我們這家客店招呼客人，特别謙和些或是店錢少些。原因是，我們店裏的老板娘和她的大女兒，都能够講三種話，也可以說是這小山谷裏的兩位語言學大家吧。老板娘在這兒學會了本地的野人話，同時又因爲是漢人父親擺夷母親生的，自然漢人話和擺夷話，就非常熟練的了。她的大女兒呢，在語言學這一課程上，却應當算是她媽媽的得意門徒的。因此，那些遠地到來的夷方女子，爲了講話的便利，和又可以得着同族女主人和悅的招呼，便都高興跑來就宿了。　　至於老劉的店子呢，他的女人是位野人婆，會說些擺夷話，但不甚精通，然而，比起那些連擺夷話也没人懂的客店來說，也就算是外交上的人材，不見怎様乏的了。所以，的我們店中住不下的擺夷，便也願意去宿夜的。　　别家客店的老板，因爲缺少這種外交上的語言人材，生意當然減色了許多，常常對這兩家的店子，尤其是我們這家的，一面搔着頭皮，發出這麽羨慕的話來。　　「嗯，我有這樣一個老婆就好了！」　　「半個也對哪，……像老劉的！」　　我的老板呢，也非常自滿的，以爲有了這麽一個老婆，做外交大臣，這麽一個女兒，做着帮辦，自己簡直可以在這小山谷裏稱王了。不管那国的使者（各色人種的旅客）前來朝賀（息宿）進貢（給店賬）是一點也感不着外交上的困難的。　　但有一次，進來一個買貨的客人，却在外交上，因爲語言的交涉，竟然也惹起了一點兒怪有興趣的事情。　　莫非來人是個唖子麽？不，還是精通三種語言的哩。你想哪，這不是很有趣味嗎？　　這人也是住在山谷裏的，專門管理山中培治道路的事情，倘若山路上，有一塊地方，突然給山洪衝毁了，從八募到騰越去的駝貨馬隊，没法兒通過，那末，八募的英国當局派人來查出了，便要責備他的。他是印度人，懂缅甸話和英語。但他呌野人下山來修路的時候，却必然先要找個會講缅甸話的野人做工頭的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言大上海  瓊聲　　於一九二九年末，由於紐約交易所的宣告破產，因而爆發的世界經濟危機之狂潮，迅速的激盪了整個的世界，在其血脗所到之處，工商業歇閉，銀行破產，農村經濟毁敗，與乎工農大衆生活惡化，失業凍餓，這已成必然而又已然的現象。徵之我国數年來的情况，「百業凋敝」，「農村破產」，早爲朝野人士，政治家經濟家時刻焦灼而不得解决的問題：工人失業，農民歉收成災，豐收亦成災，其結果匪盜之風熾行，社會動亂：凡此皆世界經濟危機多少爲其種因，似爲「無可諱言」的事實。然而，年前在此中国經濟全般破產的浪潮中，其能獨樹一幟别開生面，在「不景氣」之脅迫下而仍自維持「繁榮」者，實唯上海一埠。確乎上海人口的增加，許多大建築的興建，銀行事業發展，地價猛漲，房租增高：種種都髣髴是這「国際巿塲」的興盛，表示大有「欣欣向榮」之象。這一「繁榮」的現象，使得一些内地撈了錢，「腰纒十萬貫，騎鶴上揚州」一般的來到這「十里洋塲」作「寓翁」的人們，在此瘡痍滿目哀鴻遍野的呼號中，輔以「上海巿的繁榮」的歡聲；也曾引動許多爛熳的樂天先生們，不問全世界如是何感受「危機」的撼動，竟忘乎其形的作出無數「大上海建設計劃」來，爲建立「大上海」而「努力」。　　可是這一「上海巿繁榮」的歡呼，在我是比聽了傳道士送死者入墓時的葬歌還要悲傷，這一建立「大上海的努力」，比看了掘墓者爲埋葬失掉「靈魂」之軀殼的操勞還要心痛。上海巿的繁榮，與其譽作中国工商業的發達，無寗詡爲全国人民數年所流血液的集結，與其認爲中国財政經濟的「鞏固」，莫若看作帝国主義榨取中国人民血汗之吮吸管的膨脹。因爲在世界經濟危機掃蕩了中国之後，上海表面上還能保持着「繁榮」，并非這「經濟中心」的上海能力挽狂瀾，「中流砥柱」，而實際上是含寓着下列的三個意義：　　第一，由於世界資本制度存在而產生的世界經濟危機，使各列强的過剩生產品，與多餘資本，在帝国主義及其屬国高喊着「鎖国經濟」，「經濟戰爭」，並實行「關稅壁壘」的形勢下，當還没有用大戰來「重分天下」之前，簡直無處銷售，無處投放。當然「門户開放，機會均等」的敝国，便成爲外貨外資傾銷與投放對象。而這海口兼内地門户及「東方大都巿」的上海，便成各国進襲中国巿塲的焦點，這一種「繁榮」，無疑是中国產業的墳墓，與帝国主義勢力的穏固。　　第二，連年内戰，天災人禍，在「破」了農村經濟之「產」之後，便驅逐許多鄕村的富室與饑餓之羣，跑到都巿來謀樂土，找工作。所以上海的「繁榮」，僅　　增加了許多「寓公」，造成房租提高，地價猛漲，及無數的失業者，白相人，匪盜，乞丐。這一種「繁榮」，是中国經濟破產，人民貧困的反映。　　第三，所謂「大上海計劃」的建設，除了這一外「强中乾」的「繁榮」必然使之成爲幻想外，無疑的只可能造成於實業無補的地皮大王，房產主等投機家，及爲鞏固列强的「国際巿塲」而「努力」。　　但是，不管「大上海建設計劃」的「努力」怎樣，在經過一度「繁榮」之後，現在又起着「大上海的没落」的呼聲了。據日前的報載「本埠不特爲遠東第一大商塲，且爲全国政治經濟工商業中心，頻年各地爲内戰所累，天災人禍…唯上海則不受影響…唯年來因外貨侵入，内地經濟，已經告絶，最近更形不景氣，入超竟達七萬萬」；在這痛心疾首的叙述之後，復描寫舊曆本年年底，有五百大商號倒閉之傳說，與東京銀閘紐約華爾街相若的南京路，竟有十分之五以上商店負債，特區地方不法院，所得控告南京路商家之訟案，已達半數以上，　無法按法律手續發封云。這一事實，是上海「繁榮」的所在，亦爲「大上海計劃」之所在！「大上海没落」，「大上海没落」，若有人對此象徵着不健全制度所造成之這一「没落」有不勝懷念惜舊之情，無法只好對他致以唁弔之意．母子倆  波兒　　可憐他這小小的靈魂，跟着他年輕的母親在嚴寒風雪中生活。　　「活實在是不容易的事呀，你還要哭！」他的母親用着沉恨的聲音說着。　　「噯……噯……噯」未滿兩週年的孩子並不明白母親的苦悶，他　着哭。他母親明白他是肚子餓，但她又有什麽法子可以使他不哭不餓？早上六點鐘起來奔走到現在，人家的午飯都吃了，她才從明友那邊借到兩個小角子，怪不得他要哭。母親只得安慰他說：」你這小動物，睡覺吧，睡一覺起來就有飯吃了！」他哭得很疲倦，在母親的懷裏睡熟了，母親不敢放他上床，很怕他冷，亦很怕他醒，所以一隻手把他圍住，一隻手在燒飯，這樣冷的天氣，她把房門關着，燃着了上海第一等經濟的不煤球爐，可以燒飯同時讓小孩子取點暖氣　　母親的心想他總睡得很適意了，那知道他忽然的從她的懷裏跳起來，哭的聲調却異乎平常，好像受驚了似的，她想小孩也許是在做惡夢，很忍耐的拍他再睡覺，在飯還没有燒好的時候，他已經幾次的照這樣的驚哭，他的手脚不停的舞着，母親很躁急，她以爲飯給他吃了大槪就可以使他安靜，誰料到這回却不是這樣了，他不要吃飯，他要哭，要跳起來坐，然而他又要睡下去，他不能安定，很辛苦，他朱紅的嘴唇在這個時候忽然變得雪一樣的白，她看到這樣情形不好，就用力把他抱起，向房間踱着，摇着，歌着，一霎間，不知道怎麽的，她掁己好像站不住，脚是軟的，頭是重的，眼是花的，喉裏又像要作吐，不好了，她再不能支持，在床邊坐下，再免强的喊那樓下的大姊起來，告訴她替她抱抱小孩，說明自己一時頭昏，不能稍動，大姊本來自己手上已經抱着一個兩個月的Ｂａｂｙ她聽了並不打緊的望着，她是個鄕下的女孩了，她不能觀察出她母子的危險，恰好這個時候小孩也不哭，他的母親也没有作響，他們倒在床上，大姊以爲没有什麽事了，於是跑開，把門輕輕的關好。　　這個時候，母親不知道孩子是否停止了呼吸，她自己也覺得很辛苦，她開始明白這是空氣的作用，但再也喊不出來，起身不得，好像有意把自己的生命斷送，天啊！空氣怎麽不跑進來呢？她需要它！作最後的掙札吧！她用勁的把孩子推開，立起身來向窗前一撲，一直到不知道什麽時候才蘇醒過來，她找着她自己是睡在地板上，她記起她的孩子，她再慢慢的爬到床上，看看那小靈魂已經得到舒暢的呼吸。給失業的朋友  麥夫　　××兄：　　捧讀來信，有許多地方是酸鼻的，　　生活之逼人喲！　　唉，提起失業的事情，提起它我也覺得有許多話說。　　本來像你這種人是不應失業的。因爲，學殖卽管不提，到底也是大學畢業生呵！想起四萬萬多人的中國，萬多人</p>

<p>裏才有一個大學生，而這萬人中選的幸運兒却一批批的凍餓着。這不能說不是一件椎胸浩嘆的事吧！　　想起這一點，我便不禁深深地同情你，不但是同情，而且替你呌屈。××兄，這樣的一種社會是怎樣的値得悲傷呵！　　不過，我要告訴你的，像你這樣遭着不幸，遭着生活的逼害的人是有許多的他們不但是些平凡的大學生，而且都是有點相當的學殖的；不但是有點相當的學殖，而且許多留過洋。現在讓我告訴你一二件吧。　　我有一個姓劉的朋友，他是日本帝大土木工程科的畢業生。一位帝大的畢　　　　　是有飯吃吧。但是他回國了兩年，却連油條都找不着。最近好容易在一個工程師那裏找着了一個繪圖的事情，工作是每天十二小時，而報酬却僅僅三十元。有着三十元倒也罷了。然而最近又無因的辭退了他。辭退他以後，却由一位女的接代了。他最近來信也是嚷着失業呵。　　另一個，他是從德國學化學回來的，也只是天天跑馬路，喝着凛冽的西北風。前一向，恰好他有一個同學在某大學當個化學系主任，恰好有個化學敎員出缺了，於是便請了他去。爲了一本參考書，他是當掉一件大衣買來的。參考書買來，他便去上課了。自以爲大學敎授的職位，總可以換得轉那本參考書的代價來。可是那天走到學校正要去上課的時候，那邊却更有一人了，原來他是系主任聘請的，那一個却是院長聘來的。系主任當然是抵不過院長。於是他祗得噙着眼淚轉來了。他現在還是失業的隊員。　　然而這祗不過是萬一呵！受着生之逼害，而每天噙着眼淚微笑着找尋麫包的人們眞不知有若干呵！　　誰使他們這樣吧？果眞是如你所說，是種社會的懲罰麽？但他們爲了什麽要挨受這樣的懲罰呢？　　不從反映出這現象的社會的根本壞處着想是不能解答這些問題的。不想將這種壞的社會根本洗濯一新，更是不能解决這些問題的。國際帝國主義者，分割着這產業落後的國家。國家經濟是始終被壓迫着的。政治永遠是離着正軌而成爲帝國主義者的傀儡兒。帝國主義國的失業怒潮一掀了起來，我們的同胞也就轉進這漩渦中去了。××兄，要想避免這漩渦，那麽，需要怎樣呢？………　　要我用一些軟語來騙慰人我是不能的。要我想一些方法來指引你，帮助你也是不行的。根本這不是個部分的和簡單的問題呵。徒然說着那兒有個好機會呀，最好還是向着僻遠些的地方進攻呀，之類的話，究竟有什麽益處呢？有許多所謂社會問題專家者，是喜歡指引人家一些方法的。而許多所謂名流，所謂第一流的作家，也是喜歡告訴人家怎樣去解决這種問題的。但是我呢，我實實不敢冒昧。一個這樣不是部分不是簡單而牽涉着社會的根本問題，我除了認定向社會進攻外，怎能够再有許多「五花八門」的「不兌現」的說話呢？　　你的近况我是異嘗常同情的，但我自信不久也又會和你嘗着同樣的味兒。看喲，這充滿了矛盾的社會，那大學校，中學校，專門學校，不是浪潮似的滾着無限職業的爭奪者和失業的凖備員麽？………………　　不說了，謹此獻着我的手給你。　　　你的朋友麥夫　　今日的戀愛與婚姻  家爲　——「結緍爲戀愛的墳墓」——　　歹刀君在昨天那篇「金錢與××」的大作裏，痛駡着金錢，詛咒着金錢；人類爲牠戲弄，爲牠僚倒，尤其可痛恨的是意超縱着「至純至潔的神聖愛情」……。「金錢萬能亦萬惡」這本來是不可諱言的了。「人類的種種精神關係是受着物質的經濟關係所支配的，」「人類社會的歷史，就是經濟組織種種變遷的歷史」史的唯物論者已告我們歷來的一切何不受着「經濟」││金錢││所超縱着呢！何况是「愛情」││尤其在我們這樣的社會組織裏面││過去不久本刋曾載某君的「婚姻與身份」（？）說明着今日的「婚姻制度。」但是更在前記得本刋已發表了某君的「怎樣避免戀愛的悲劇」（？）裏早說明惟有在將來改革了的「社會組織」裏說可得眞實而完滿的戀愛。這是縱的觀察，我現在來進而從横的方面看今日的戀愛和婚姻││所造成的「悲劇」的因果。但是這只是以一般的現象而已。│　　由封建社會的父母之命，媒灼之言的「賈買式　婚姻」││那時確造成了無數的「曠夫怨婦」││進而產生了社交公開的，掁由戀愛而「婚姻自主」了。這當然是由歷史進化底客觀的條件所成就的。但是繼此而生的又有「結婚爲戀愛之墳墓」之說了。看罷！在各報的啓事格内的「離婚」啓文，社會新聞格内的起訴控告「虐待」「遺棄」等而求異離的由戀愛結合底案子，不正是「結婚爲戀愛的墓墳」的好證嗎？　　社交公開自由戀愛「男朋友」「女朋友」「愛人」「情人」是無分别的名詞。有了「異性的朋友」，就是有了「愛人」。在朋友間可各自誇耀他或她的「愛人」如人美貌，摩登，富有……只是注重外貌而學識，能力，體格可不顧問之。而一般没有得之者聞之何等的心動羨慕，因此也就渴望追求，以滿足一時的私慾。這就是今日的社交「戀愛」││遊戲性底吧││爲的是誇耀，虚榮，或一時的衝動罷了。　　在他們的戀愛期中，爲要達到最後的目的者││結婚，變爲「私有」││因此掩飾着自己的短處，熱烈地胡戀着，遊公園，　舞塲，往影院……以物質的享樂來連　着維持着這戀愛。（中途若有變故，亦當然爲物質的享樂底條件不足，或另有比之更高的了。失戀後而消極自殺，多角戀愛的仇視，仇殺當歸之於各人的「私有制度」罷了。）待到目的已達││結了婚吧││對方確　爲「己有」，事前的渴望可以去消，心也能放了。因此不知不覺地把自己的短處也一一暴露了出來，而言行也當不比從前的熱烈親愛了。（此所以有人說「婚後的愛情比婚前的愛情淡薄之故吧。）照這樣的下去不久，各方就得漸漸地起了恐懼與猜疑。恐懼因回憶了婚前婚後的大不相同，由此而起着種種猜疑。要知多疑就是一事敗的起點。一日復一日的下去，各人的心中存了不快，不滿，而感情也愈往下冷淡，關係越趨於破裂因而弦變成「同床異夢」了。到後終於鬧得異離。這就是所謂「結婚爲戀愛的墳墓」吧！也就是在這社會組織裏的戀愛與婚姻了。業餘信箱從舊禮敎中解放出來　　！编者先生：　　恕我罷在你千忙萬勞之中再來煩擾你的淸神，因爲我事實上不得不至誠的請求你了！　　我七歲時没了我的慈母，後來因家中積蓄有限，兄弟又多，所以吾父親限於敎養的能力薄弱，因此在九歲上給我送到姓張的家中去做童年媳。不料一進他家的門庭，眞如入虎狼之穴，他們非但勿給我些好敎訓，並且時時挨他們的打駡，什麽齷齪的事情都要我去幹。整日勞苦與忍耐悲哀的我，偶然在二十年上，因爲他家的大姊到上海來了，我也就跟了她到上海維新扣子廠裏來做工。那是我的嫡親哥哥，也來上海經商了所以我一面在做工；一面我因性喜讀書，于是常常隨着我嫡親哥哥，到他的朋友那裏補習補習功課。這時我把平日所賺的工資統統寄回婆家去，給他們家用，不顧自己身上衣着的襤褸。因此總計起來，差不多已滿二百塊錢給他家了。　　先生這都是我的汗血呀！唉！人情　　鬼蜮，世態炎凉，在這個月中，我忽然接到他家　來信三四封，說要我卽刻返家…有重大之事…并且我的舊頭腦的父兄也逼迫我，要呌我回去。他們呌我到鄉下去，無非是與那個兇狠的男人結婚罷！我已經受了他們慘酷的虐待，情願回去麽！我是死也不肯和他去結婚的。但在這千難萬難的環境之中，我怎麽辦呢？你看社會能承認我嗎？同時對于我有志讀書的理想，照我目前經濟情形，如何可實現？這些我都等待着：　　先生的回答，祝你，撰安。　　　　　　　　夏秋心謹啓　　編者按：結婚是要出于自願的，你旣不願與張姓成婚，他們那裏可以强迫你。你鼓起勇氣，堅决告訴他們，你不肯與你的未婚夫結婚，你不願回去，至于「社會能承認你嗎？」這要看你指的是那一種人，如果是說的一斑頭腦冬烘充滿着封建思想的人，那他們不但要看不起你，還要責備你，迫你去做你所不願做的事。但是如果你說的是思想進步的人，那他們不但對你表同情，並且還要盡可能地帮助你奮鬥。　　現在一般人常常痛恨舊禮敎，但他自己却依然爲舊禮敎，舊風俗所支配，不敢在實際上作反抗。像這個樣子，儘管口口聲聲在喊着打倒舊禮敎，實際上舊禮敎的勢力反要一天天的膨脹，因爲他們自己在實際上還是投降舊禮敎，替舊禮敎推波助瀾。　　你要讀書嗎？很好。因爲讀書可以帮助我們了解實際生活，可以做我們奮鬥的導師。現在讀書是非錢不行的，但是越是有錢的人越不願讀書，越是窮人却越是喜歡讀書，也越是需要讀書，本報設有流通圖書館（在南京路大陸商塲三樓）館内並有讀書指導部，你可以向該館去要份章程，加入做讀者，並參加讀書指導部研究。它是爲大衆服務的，所以不需費用。　　末了，我們希望張女士能：在實踐上去打倒舊禮敎　！　　堅决的不與你不願嫁的男子結婚！不爲舊勢力所屈服！　　由讀書而了解實際生活，並踏上光明的道路。自我職業介紹　　蕾女士，上海人，護士學校畢業，曾任特别護士，今願爲人行各種注射手術，每日隔日均可，酬勞不計，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。露沙女士，年廿一歲，上海籍，高中肄業，曾任小學級任及家庭敎員等職，今願任以上職務或其他抄寫，報館剪貼，及助理文字工作等職，通信處閘北新民路仁安里八號。　　王女士，年二十三歲，生長滬上，高中畢業，現願任家庭敎師，小學低級敎員，或保姆，書記等職，薪金不計，須供膳宿，具有殷實舗保，欲聘者，請投函南陽橋方浜路恒安坊四十二號。小說孤獨的人　（十）  黛妮　　（五）　夜話　　克佳從沙發上跳了起來，抓了一把瓜子，嗑着，走近效蓀身旁。　　　「弟弟，這些都是廢話，我們以後不談勤菠，現在…」他凑近寫字臺，附着效蓀的耳畔，「我想你，不必回杭州去了，我的岳母很有意思…」　　停止了，注視着效蓀，照他老實不客氣的皮氣，眞要拉了效蓀的手臂說啊說啊地喊出來。　　效蓀没有回答。習惯地抽了枝煙，半響，說道：「靜文？」　　靜宜慢慢地走近寫字臺，像一個從久病的人，一切動作都是那樣慢，似乎使人喘不過氣來。鐘聲擺動着，白色的烟隨了春風向窗外飛散，輕輕地。　　效蓀突然從寫字椅里站起，兩個人同時退後了一步。他一條腿支着地仮。坐到寫字臺上去，好像費了很大氣力說了│　　「這事情我早已料到。起初我自以爲神經過敏，最近幾天來，你們，誰何都注意着我的行動，我早想在没有發動之前到杭州去；但是我什麽都怕動，甚至吃飯睡覺，一時又想馬上動身，我是矛盾地生活着…」他換了一枝煙，　　接着說：「不過由於勤菠的那天舉動，這事情或者不致於發生。克佳你是知道的，我不願意爲了我的事使人不快。我是個不能結婚的人，我是頭脫了驢的野馬，我不能將一個女子的幸福犧牲在我手中：然而我能拒絶於這事情發生之後嗎？但是…」他摇動着天然鬆曲的頭髮，神經質地低下頭去。　　靜宜屏息着呼吸聽他獨白，這時纔回過氣來再坐到沙發上去，動作是那樣地慢，像一個久病的人。克佳把手中的瓜子放到盒子里，搓着兩手，來回的踱了幾步，似乎没有事情可做，漫無主意的抽起烟來。　　鐘聲擺動着，白色的隨了春風向窗外飛散，輕輕地。　　「克佳，」效蓀把他呌住了踱步「我不願意爲了我的事使人不快，當然我不願意你做個爲難的中間人，我明天就到杭州去，在老太太面前只做没有講起這件事：而且不致太使靜文難堪，一個女子是受不得這類刺激的。」　　克佳重復來回地踱起步來，仍了烟尾，抓着瓜子嗑着。　　「效蓀，」他似乎没有想出底下的話，重復的│「效蓀，就地…也不必急急於到杭州去，我總能：總能：」野牛抓着頭髮，運動家他不熟悉這一類的適當的措辭，「我總能…總能設法把這事情敷衍過去，你一走，豈不是更使人難堪。」野牛竭力拚出粗野的笑聲。　　效蓀似乎感動了一下摇動着他天然鬆曲的頭髮，低聲地│　　「明天再談罷，我腦筋中亂得很，我想早些睡。」　　他拳頭槌着太陽穴，向門外走去：樓梯旁郤送來了無邪的笑聲，堋文雙手把門首攔阻，拉了效蓀的手拖回來。　　「好。」她把效蓀推到一個椅子里，舒了一口氣「送走了。這個自由的身體可以恣情的玩上幾天」。拍着自己的胸脯，小孩子似的抓過一把瓜子來。　　靜家免强地說了句「夜車開了！」　　克佳來回地踱方步。效蓀注視着地上同天的瓜子殼。　　鐘聲擺動着，打了十一下，淸脆地在二月的空氣中震盪。毛哥哥寶妹妹同遊世界  猛遇着拐騙　　莈米没有賣得錢：毛哥寶妹淚漣漣，拐騙見了機會好：裝着對他很哀憐。　　拐騙花言巧語道：你們太餓了，同到我家去，給你吃個飽！　　前面便是拐騙家？他說家中還有一個　　　　　拐騙那里給　我們恨　　地把我們　在黑房裡！我們又遭飢餓又着　！</p>

<p>電影專刊論「倫理片」新舊之别  寒黎　　在很久以前，就有人提出「新倫理」影片拍攝的主張。最近因爲中國電影題材方面，遇到了阻力，「新倫理片」的攝製空氣，又濃厚起來。在複雜的社會關係中，親族的關係，是比較埸親密的。因時更因爲親族之中的財產的共和，相關的痛癢，就更加密切；所以卽使一貫的被人們認爲「天性」的，或則「不可解釋」的親族關係，特别是親子關係，唯物主義者，同樣能够找出他們的物質根據來。表現這種親族關係的影片，我們就呌他「倫理影片」　　因爲傅統的意識，决定了人類關於「親族」特别是「親子」的感情：我們的電影作家，是很聰明的利用這一點而製作無數倫理影片來賺觀衆的眼淚。凡是最容易賺觀衆眼淚的影片，就是最好的影片，這是評論「倫理影片」的一般的標凖。所以，每一張倫理影片的結果，總是「親愛」戰勝了一切。所謂「新倫理片」者　，就是把與人的關係，特别是親子關係，重行確定。這自然是對的。但是我們得注意，親子或則親族之間之一切關係，并不是限於親族或則親子本身，我們應該指出在這些關係之上還有更複雜的社會關係，一切不合理的事件，一切親子之間之悲劇，造成的只是不健全的社會組織。親子之間一切悲劇，只有在整個的社會組織得到解决的時候，暫能解决。杜介揑夫的「父與子」中明顯的展開了新與舊的衝突，潘非洛夫的「布羅斯基」中，兒子脫離了父親的掌握，而加入貧農團。格萊特可夫的「士敏土」中，是顯現出哥哥與弟弟，因爲兩種不同的政治信仰，而互相戰鬥。至於格利和黛莎，那一對夫婦，更因爲獲得新意識的程度的差别，而各走各路。　　爲了一個父親或則母親，爲了一個哥哥或則弟弟假使和爲了人類的未來，他們之間的比重，是絶明顯的。新的倫理影片，和舊的倫理影片的，不同就在這裏—自然像我上面所說的，并不抺殺人類的感情，正相反，他們是爲了無數的父親與母親的，無數的哥哥與弟弟啊！日本學校管理人會議，最近發表的「防止學生革命行動最有效的力量，就是父母的感情。」據說「有很多學生，的確爲了父母親的感情，而停止活動，」那末，我們就知所努力了。至於觀念地創造着的英雄犧牲着家族之愛而漠然不動者，不但是不眞實，并且是不必要的，我們是要知道他們是怎樣艱苦的克服自已的感情！　　「都會的早晨，」「母性之光，」無疑的把親子之間的關係，給了一個新的解釋。但是很多「倫理影片」，依舊停留着舊的阱陷中。　　當前的阻力，是存在着。那末，中國電影最近要走着那條「倫理片」的路是必定的。在這一種傾向開始的現在，我們提起這個先决問題，絶不是多鑒於日本學校管理人會議所發表的言論，我們已經知道不正確的倫理片，將生出何等嚴重的效果，「新倫理　片」的製作，是開發着中國電影的題材的。影片談評評「人海滄桑」  凌鶴　　Ｃｏｕｎｓｅｌｌｏｉ’ＡｔＬａｗ　　約翰巴里摩亞演技的成績，乃是博得廣大的觀衆們之最高稱譽的。「棄夫」，「再度春風」，「陶白士敎授」，以及在「晚宴」中所飾的戲子。都有着最高的成績。他有着豐富的情感，天才的表演，因此，特别是「再度春風」中政權没落的公爵，「棄夫」中神經錯亂的退伍軍官，更給與人們最深的刺戟，這因爲他可以充分的運用他豐富的感情之故。相反的，「凌霄壯志」中他所飾的是十分理智的航空公司的經理，在他的表演上，固然仍是深握着劇中人之個性，然而他没有給人更深刻的靈的刺激。「人海滄桑」與後者頗相近，没有給他表現熱情的機會。然而他在自殺的前後，却終於給與人們不可磨滅的印象了。　　當然，更値得我們介紹的還是導演威廉瓦拉（ＷｉｌｌｉａｍＷｙｌｅｒ）的手法了。在電影上我似乎還是第一次發現不，還有「大飯店」也是如此。整個的劇就祇發生在一個屋子裏，好像舞台劇的獨幕劇一樣，僅僅是時間上不像獨幕劇那末拘束，這裏的時間延長到兩天以上。當然這不是說和獨幕劇完全一樣，祗有一個景自開始至終結，這兒一共三四個房間之多。而整個的劇就祗發生在這律師的辦公室。　　正因爲如此，導演在開始時便將一所高大的洋房介紹出來，然後說明這塲所在這屋子的第幾層樓，再以推鏡頭，由電梯旁推向西門律師的辦公室。再後便是辦公室的大廳，許多人在等候着與律師會面。彼此開始，爲了要描寫律師的業務的興旺，由於接線生的忙亂的接綫，急迫而流麗的口齒，使全劇進行到極快的調子。人們不住的來往，辦事員不住的走進走出。這時候特别寫一個步伐極慢的女職員，在極快的旋律中來一個極慢的對照，於是更加顯得生動了。在人們十分忙碌的當中，在十分熱烈的空氣中，許久，才使主角登塲，這和京戲中在　囉們的摇旗呐喊聲中而後主帥出塲；有同樣的效能。於是律師上塲之後，便是接電話，電話之後又是電話，一面打電話一面和訴訟的當事人談話，而且又一面和女書記談話，女書記放下打字機便是記錄，記錄了之後又是打字。律師吩咐辦事員，辦事員忙碌的辦公。……電話，打字機，接綫生，辦事員，書記，客人的焦急，律師的忙於應付，整個的戲，大半是快的律動。　　因爲大半是快的旋律之故，中間揷入兩段靜的塲面，更見有力。一爲律師之妻氣忿忿的决定别丈夫單獨去歐洲之後，西門律師感覺痛苦而面對窗外深思，爲以後之自殺作一伏綫。一爲律師之妻已偕情人去歐洲的當時，律師萬念俱　　（接第六）　　鄭正秋老夫子編劇導演的有聲片「姊妹花」，據說成績比「自由之花」更美滿，舊曆新年中在新光公映。</p>

<p>(Beiping) A telegram arrived in Ping from Ningxia today, reporting on the battle situation, stating that on the 4th, Xia Weili, the brigade commander of the enemy's Xia Brigade, led his troops to break out from our right wing's positions between the Dali Temple and the Balamiao Temple, and circled around to attack the southwest corner of the Ningyuan city. At dawn on the 5th, over two hundred enemy Dare-to-Die troops first carried ladders to climb the city walls. Their main force was ambushed in various villages and towns six or seven miles southwest of Ningyuan, including Lijiazhai, Zhujiazhai, Baojiazhai, and Baojiaqiao, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Our defending troops used machine guns to sweep the Dare-to-Die troops, killing over a hundred and causing them to fall at the base of the city walls, and captured the Dare-to-Die team leader Xiao Yongxian and seventy soldiers, along with over sixty large and small guns. On the same day, our infantry and cavalry units completely surrounded Xia's brigade and various enemy troops.  After fierce fighting all day, over a thousand enemies were killed, and the Diao and Yuan regiments were gradually eliminated, seizing over six hundred enemy rifles, over eighty pistols, and capturing over four hundred enemy officers and soldiers. The rebel Xia Weili was also bombed to death. The rebel Liu Yuting dispatched troops to reinforce, but they were repulsed by our army. At dawn on the 6th, about six hundred remaining soldiers of Xia's brigade fled in disarray north of Xincheng. Two of our regiments followed and pursued them, engaging in a fierce encirclement battle at Wangjiazhai, north of Xincheng. According to the captured enemy battalion commander Ma Wenxi, his unit suffered heavy casualties, and was short of food and ammunition, with no will to fight. After Sun was dismissed, many of his subordinates were unwilling to follow him, etc. (8th day special telegram) (Beiping) Since Sun Dianying was dismissed from all his posts, he has not repented, and is still besieging the Ningxia provincial capital. Last night, Ma sent a telegram to Ping, saying that the battle situation was very good, and Pingluo had not fallen. It is said that the authorities, because Sun has not left the army and is still resorting to arms, have decided to send troops to encircle and suppress Sun's troops. (8th day special telegram) (Beiping) Xu Yongchang, after reporting to the authorities about the political situation in Shanxi and the Sun-Ma conflict, was ordered by Yan Xishan to come to Ping on the 14th or 15th. (8th day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying has made no indication since his dismissal. Recently, he has intensified his attack on Ningxia. The Ningxia provincial capital has been besieged by Sun's army for nearly a week. Now, there is a rumor that Ningxia city has been captured by Sun's army. Reporters have inquired from various sources, but have not been able to confirm it. According to some sources, Sun is preparing to lead his troops westward, planning to occupy Ningxia and then directly attack the border between Gansu and Shaanxi. If the Ningxia army is strong enough and he cannot pass through, he will lead his troops westward along the northern Mongolian border of Ningxia. In order to avoid the devastation of the Northwest, the military authorities hope that Sun can finally come to his senses, hand over his military power, and not be held accountable for the past. Otherwise, encirclement and suppression will be carried out in the near future. (8th day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to military news, Ningxia sent a telegram on the 7th stating that the previous report that Pingluo had fallen, Ma Baolin had been killed in battle, and the three counties including Jinji had been occupied by Sun's army, had been denied by a telegram from Ma Hongkui. (8th day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ge Qiwei, the director of education in Ningxia, said that Sun's attacks on Ningxia had all been repulsed. Ningyuan is still besieged by Ma's army. The rumor that Ningxia has fallen is absolutely untrue. The armies of Gansu and Qinghai are rushing to Ningxia for reinforcement, and there are also large armies pressing from Baotou. Sun can be eliminated soon. (8th day Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu said that he has never heard of the Sun-Ma conflict, and the report that Liu Xizhong represented him in mediation is inaccurate. (8th day special telegram)</p>

<p>Gubeikou</p>
<h3 id="e9">Reception plan agreed upon <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Reception can be completed before the 15th</p>
<p>A Zazhi Bureau will be established in Miyun</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng goes to Tianjin again for instructions</p>
<p>Red Party distributes propaganda in the Zunhua and Qian'an area</p>
<p>(Beiping) The plan to receive Gubeikou has been agreed upon by Yin Rugeng through negotiations with the Japanese side, and the reception can be completed before February 15th. Yin went to Tianjin for instructions and will return to Ping no later than the day after tomorrow. A Zazhi Bureau will be established in Miyun to assist the county government in handling negotiations. The powers of the Zazhi members will be parallel to those of the county magistrate. Wei Yonghe, the commander of the security general team, is internally appointed as the director of the Gubeikou Public Security Bureau. (8th day Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the morning of the 8th, Yin Rugeng again reported to Yu Xuezhong that leaflets of the Ludong Red Army guerrillas had been found in the villages of Zunhua. The leaflets were written in ink, with poor handwriting and language. There were twelve slogans attached, such as "Down with so-and-so," "Worker-peasant compromise," "Destroy the bourgeoisie," and "Proletarian masses unite." He also asked for instructions on the three items of receiving Gubeikou, Malanyu, and the reorganization of Hu's troops in Yutian. The Communists in Zunhua and Qian'an are said to be under the command of Jiang Hao. Jiang is as famous as Li Dazhao and is now serving as an executive committee member of the Third International Youth Party in Moscow. Jiang is a native of Yutian, and his accomplices are under orders to operate in northern Hebei. When the Ludong war broke out last spring, they secretly organized military police, civilians, teachers, and civil servants, and their potential was great. The recent incident is just the beginning. There are already three hundred worker-peasant guerrillas, of whom one hundred have guns. The two counties are cooperating in suppression, and they have been divided into several places for propaganda. The Hebei authorities ordered Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming to investigate and handle the matter together, and ordered the militia to defend and suppress them. The formalities for receiving Gubeikou were decided by Yin Rugeng after requesting instructions from Yu Xuezhong on the 8th, and can be implemented within two weeks. Yin is scheduled to return to Ping on the 10th and will go to Gubeikou with Shibayama, the military attache of the Japanese embassy. After our side takes over, the public security bureau and the county government will be reformed administratively. The Ji-Mi Commissioner's Office will set up an office in the area to handle foreign affairs. The Japanese army currently has a regimental headquarters and a battalion headquarters in the area, with two companies stationed there. It is planned that they will not withdraw when we take over, but this point we have not yet agreed to. There are 300 Japanese troops and two battalions of puppet troops stationed in Malanyu. The airfield occupies 50 mu. Negotiations are underway for its return to our side. Yin Rugeng plans to investigate during the Spring Festival when Gubeikou is received. (8th day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The reception of Gubeikou can be implemented around the 20th of this month. Xifeng, Jieling, and Lengkou are still guarded by the Japanese army. After the reception of Yuguan and Gubeikou is resolved, it can be carried out in sequence. (8th day special telegram)</p>

<p>Reviews Zhao and Zhang's divisions</p>
<p>Finds ways to relieve disaster victims</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou states that Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Qin Dechun, took three cars and a platoon of pistol team members at noon on the 6th to inspect eastern Chahar, first arriving in Zhangbei. Song convened county government personnel for a speech and reviewed Zhao Dengyu's division. On the morning of the 7th, he passed Baochang, where garrison commander Yao Jingchuan reported on the elimination of bandits at Shirenliang. In the afternoon, he transferred to Chicheng to review Zhang Renjie's and Song Tielin's brigades. Song and others left Chicheng on the morning of the 8th and can arrive in Zhangjiakou in the afternoon. Eastern Chahar is frequently afflicted by disasters. After Song returns to Zhangjiakou, he will find ways to relieve the disaster victims and will go to Ping on the 11th to report to the authorities. He will return to Chahar this month. (8th day special telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying said that after the tension of the eastern Chahar problem, he was ordered by Song to go to Nanjing to meet Chiang and Wang, and gave a detailed report on the defense of eastern Chahar. Chiang gave some instructions on the defense of eastern Chahar. I returned to Ping last night. Because I received a telegram from Zhangjiakou, Song will come to Ping within days, and I will stay in Ping to wait for the meeting. After the Xia Ziming brigade of miscellaneous troops from Chahar Province was transferred to the third fort, they were basically reorganized. Eastern Chahar is now peaceful. The Japanese and puppet troops have not clashed with the Chahar army, but I hope that the people of the country will not ignore it. The government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is temporarily difficult to realize due to certain reasons. However, in order to consolidate the border defense, the central government will recently give a high position to a certain important Mongolian figure. (8th day special telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Paris Riot  Shu <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>France, which had been stable for a long time, although feeling the frenzy of the world economic panic and the threat of fascism, remained safe and stable. On the one hand, it supported the wavering situation of the Treaty of Versailles, and on the other hand, it maintained its position as the leader of European finance, making it impossible for Germany and Italy to ignore the dominance of the French franc. Even the British pound and the US dollar were inevitably affected by it. This was truly no easy task. Unexpectedly, an unexpected incident occurred. A car crash in the suburbs of Paris was originally an accidental event. The Stavisky affair was also not a case related to the general situation of France. But due to a riot in the streets, it became impossible to maintain order, and order was completely broken. The French parliamentary politics are characterized by a proliferation of small parties. There is no lack of right-wing, central, and left-wing parties, such as the Republican Party, the Republican Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Socialist Party. Any one party has at most 150 seats, and it is impossible to have a majority to control the parliament. Therefore, the cabinet based on parliamentary trust is actually unable to implement its so-called democratic politics, and can only organize multi-party cabinets in the form of coalition. The instability of its foundation and the impermanence of its life are already obvious. In the past two years, there have been six changes of cabinets, from Herriot, Boncour, Daladier, Sarraut, Chautemps, and then Daladier again. Most of them are centered on the Socialist and Radical Socialist parties, and none of them have lasted long. This is due to the special situation of the parliament. If the people in power do not have considerable experience, I don't know how many confusions have been brewed.</p>
<p>Since World War I, France's traditional policy has belonged to the category of maintaining the status quo. Therefore, whoever organizes the cabinet, there will be no serious consequences for foreign policy and domestic facilities. But this time, the biggest riot since the Bastille occurred in the city of Paris. The Royalist Party demonstrated everywhere, and the Communist Party counter-demonstrated everywhere. In Paris alone, more than 400 people were killed and injured, and it will spread to important cities such as Lyon and Marseille. Although the Daladier cabinet won a majority of 300 votes in the House of Representatives, it had to resign due to the failure on the streets and the resistance of the masses. The life of the cabinet was only a week, which is also rare. This kind of situation may not have a huge impact on the entire future of France, but parliamentary politics will be even more shaken in the future, which can be foreseen. The performance of the French parliament has also deviated from the masses, and it is difficult to meet the demands of the people, and it is not yet known what path the people will take.</p>
<p>When we examine the future of France, there are three points to pay attention to. (1) The Paris riot is indeed a local political problem within France, but it has a serious impact on the entire French society. It is related to everything in political issues. Will it tend to the right as a result, or not? Its impact can reach all of Europe, causing strong stimulation to international relations, especially to Germany and Italy. It is even more worthy of attention. (2) France's army is arguably the first in Europe, but its population is stagnating. The number of standing soldiers cannot even be filled by French men, and Africans are conscripted. Based on this alone, it is enough to see the difficulties that France cannot easily overcome. (3) Although France has a huge amount of 80 billion francs in cash, it should be able to continue to support its gold standard system, maintain its claims on European countries, and maintain its world dominance in finance. However, within France, it will still be trapped in a stalemate. Low prices and overproduction will eventually become chronic sclerosis. Even the government's budget deficit of 6 billion francs is difficult to fill. Therefore, the general public feels that the burden is too heavy, and the future is also difficult to stabilize.</p>

<h3 id="e16">the world becomes increasingly uneasy <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Great Britain has a major change in public opinion on disarmament</p>
<p>Expanding armaments becomes increasingly pressing</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday night's discussion in the lower house has shown that disarmament is currently an issue with inconsistent views in British public opinion. Previously, the people of the country almost unanimously believed that disarmament was the most important event in international politics, but today, those who advocate disarmament have mostly changed their opinions, believing that disarmament is indeed necessary, but doubts have arisen as to whether it can actually be implemented. The change in their attitude is, of course, due to the events of the past two years.</p>
<p>Such as Japan's invasion of Manchuria and withdrawal from the League of Nations, Germany's demand for equal armaments and withdrawal from the League of Nations, recent events in Austria, France's attitude towards disarmament, and the United States' resolution to build 120 warships. During the discussion of this matter in the lower house, Baldwin made an important speech, openly declaring the inadequacy of the defense of the British Empire, and Churchill advocated abolishing the London Naval Treaty, which only applies to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, and wanted to greatly increase the British Air Force, because the British Air Force, in terms of numbers, is far inferior to the United States, France, and Russia.</p>
<p>Baldwin said that the British government is making a final effort on the European security issue, so it has submitted a disarmament memorandum. As for whether there is hope of success, it will soon be known. If it fails, then the British government should take responsibility for quickly focusing on British interests first. Even if an agreement is reached, the British government's responsibility lies in ensuring that the United Kingdom actively prepares within the scope permitted by the agreement, striving for efficiency and completeness. This is also what any country must do, because only in this way can it fulfill its responsibilities with other countries when implementing sanctions. (Reuters Electric, 7th)</p>

He confirmed upon arriving in London that the assassination plot was discovered. After Allenby arrived in Java, the Dutch authorities suddenly warned him that someone wanted to assassinate him. He does not know the inside story, but he heard that the assassin was an Oriental. It was later learned that he was Japanese, but he does not know the method or the reason. In Singapore, someone suggested that the Straits Settlements should provide 500,000 yuan (approximately 59,000 British pounds) in imperial defense funds.

The government, seeing this situation, was very flustered and keenly felt the need to take preemptive action. Therefore, at 4:30 PM, Secretary-General Horikiri met with Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima, intending to request Nakajima's voluntary decision. Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima also knew that the situation had reached this point and submitted his resignation on the grounds of being unable to fulfill his duties due to illness. Secretary-General Horikiri immediately went to Prime Minister Saito's private residence in Yotsuya, delivering Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima's resignation in person. The Prime Minister immediately summoned Matsumoto Joji, the former Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, earnestly requesting him to succeed as Minister of Commerce and Industry. After Matsumoto agreed, Nakajima's resignation was conveyed to the Imperial Palace. (Dentsu News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ashikaga Takauji issue in the House of Peers developed in a way that the government and most of the House of Peers had not foreseen. Even the Kenkyukai, which held a self-respecting attitude, stated that since the situation had deteriorated so much, Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima had no choice but to resign. Although there were criticisms that Mimurodo Keiko (Kenkyukai) had abruptly taken the impeachment out of the scope of questioning the Minister of State, sympathy for Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima did not increase as a result. The government had long been at a loss, and some within the government also advocated that the Minister of Commerce and Industry had no choice but to resign, and some cabinet members even argued that Prime Minister Saito, who had recommended the Minister of Commerce and Industry, should also resign due to his responsibility. However, there were also those who said that the problem was the Minister of Commerce and Industry's own problem. When the Saito Cabinet was formed in May of the previous year, Prime Minister Saito could not have foreseen that this problem would arise, and the Minister of Commerce and Industry's essay was written ten years ago, so the Prime Minister could not be held responsible retroactively. Moreover, at this time of emergency, it is especially inappropriate to cause chaos in the overall situation. Therefore, although the Minister of Commerce and Industry's resignation is unavoidable, the government should be cautious. (Dentsu News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Takauji issue of Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima in the House of Peers, the government initially thought it was not optimistic, but ultimately Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima resigned due to this. In the plenary session on the 7th, Viscount Mimurodo pressed Prime Minister Saito to recommend the Minister of Commerce and Industry and vigorously pursued answers. In the plenary session on the 8th, the government still did not answer and postponed it to the plenary session on the 9th. The government was concerned that the Prime Minister's response would cause serious consequences, so it carefully reviewed the verbatim record of the 8th and examined in detail the questions asked by Viscount Mimurodo. At the same time, it was discussed in detail at the cabinet seats in the House of Peers. However, from the government's standpoint, the Prime Minister could only insist on expressing regret, or perhaps separate the responsibility of recommending the Minister of Commerce and Industry from the Minister of Commerce and Industry's writing disaster, making it a completely separate issue. It is said that the government will base its response on this strategy. (Nikkan News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Matsumoto Joji, is from Gifu Prefecture, born in Meiji 10 (1877), and is currently 58 years old. He was a professor at the Imperial University and holds a doctorate in law. He is an authority in the business world. Later, he was involved with the South Manchuria Railway for many years and was also the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau of the Kiyoura Cabinet. He has served as a member of the House of Peers and has been a lawyer for a long time, a leading figure in that field. His name has been frequently mentioned whenever a cabinet is formed, and his knowledge and personality are considered to be those of a capable minister. The general public is pleased that he has been appointed as Minister of Commerce and Industry this time. (Nikkan News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>The Daladier Government Dies Young</p>
<h3 id="e20">Doumergue Receives Mandate to Form Cabinet <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Conditional on Dissolving Parliament</p>
<p>The Public Is Won Over; Old but Vigorous</p>
<p>Recruiting Prominent Figures to Form a Strong Government</p>
<p>Individuals Involved in Corruption Cases Are Generally Excluded from the Cabinet</p>
<p>(Paris) As angry crowds across Paris shouted (revenge), the short-lived Daladier cabinet died yesterday. After several hours of hesitation, the 70-year-old former President Doumergue agreed to take the premiership.</p>
<p>After Doumergue accepted the mandate to form a cabinet, the political situation began to clear. It is widely believed that the new cabinet will recruit several prominent figures and may be formed within twelve hours. Doumergue's acceptance was compelled by the earnest persuasion of President Lebrun, and both the Senate, Chamber of Deputies, and members of the Paris City Council supported it. Doumergue, who originally lived in the countryside, immediately packed his bags and came to Beijing after agreeing to form a cabinet. Doumergue's first action after taking office was to issue an order that all national theaters would be closed last night to show the nation's condolences for the victims. Previously, the President had summoned Barthou (who served as Prime Minister from 1910 to 1913) to the presidential residence for consultation, and then decided to ask Doumergue to bear the burden, as Doumergue had initially declined. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Former President Doumergue arrived in Paris at 8:30 this morning, after leaving his private residence in Turneville. A large crowd gathered at the station, shouting "Long Live Doumergue" and "Long Live France." In less than two minutes, Doumergue entered the presidential palace to formally accept the mandate to form a cabinet from President Lebrun, and immediately consulted with key political figures. He also visited the speakers of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. So far, Doumergue has consistently refused to issue a statement to reporters, so the new cabinet's lineup is currently unknown. As Doumergue's car passed through the streets, it became the target of cheers from the people of Paris, who expressed their trust in him. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Paris has returned to normal after the riots of the past two days. According to veteran politicians, the 71-year-old former President intends to organize a new cabinet whose members have no connection to the Bayonne affair or other political and financial corruption cases, and who are trusted not only by the Parliament but also by the entire French people. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) There is speculation that Caillaux, who previously served as Prime Minister and Finance Minister, may be appointed as the new Finance Minister. Théodore, Herriot, and Barthou are all expected to join the cabinet. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>The Founding Father Takes on a Difficult Task</p>
<h3 id="e21">Unanimous Support from All Parties <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>No One but Him Can Be the Pillar</p>
<p>The Nation Is in Trouble; Stop Partisan Strife</p>
<p>The New Cabinet Lacks a Solid Foundation Due to a Lack of Party Discipline</p>
<p>Will Avoid Dissolving Parliament Unless Absolutely Necessary</p>
<p>(Paris) Members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and former Prime Ministers of all political colors, support Doumergue's formation of a cabinet. Even Herriot, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party and former Prime Minister, with the consent of his party, is also among those in support. Members of the Radical Socialist Party and other parties held separate meetings in the afternoon. Doumergue will not encounter major difficulties in forming a cabinet tomorrow. The cabinet he forms will be a kind of "truce cabinet of all parties." The official gazette released by the presidential palace in the evening stated that former President Doumergue, at the urging of President Lebrun, and with a psychology of complete loyalty to the country, will take on the difficult task. In addition, members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies who have served as Prime Minister also issued a public statement after a meeting, saying that at this time of national crisis, no one can be a stronger pillar than former President Doumergue. Therefore, the whole body unanimously expressed sympathy for Doumergue's cabinet formation and notified Doumergue of this intention. The public statement also said that while they have made this expression, they are not imposing any restrictions on Doumergue's actions, and Doumergue is completely free to select cabinet members. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) All of France's most powerful political parties, except the Socialist Party, have agreed to support Doumergue, at least as far as their leaders are concerned. The new cabinet may recruit former Prime Ministers. It is said that the new cabinet lacks genuine unity and party discipline, so its foundation is as weak as previous cabinets. Although the Parliament is the most difficult obstacle to overcome, Doumergue will still do his best to manipulate the various parties in the Chamber of Deputies to avoid resorting to dissolution. This is common in other countries, but in France, it is not done unless absolutely necessary. In the past sixty years, it has only been done once. Doumergue, because party governments have repeatedly failed, now intends to organize a government of national unity, but ultimately cannot be tainted with the colors of the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist Party. These two parties are no longer trusted in the eyes of the voters. However, the two parties are deeply concerned about the rise of the fascist Tittoni and fear that the semi-dictator Chapu will seize power with the help of the royalists, so they will temporarily put aside their actions. Many people believe that the only solution now lies in reforming civil administration, providing appropriate compensation, and breaking away from political bias. The responsibility for preserving the French Third Republic now rests with Doumergue. Doumergue, commonly known as "Papa," has become the most beloved person in the country. Doumergue retired from political life and married in his hometown after his term as President from 1924 to 1931. Doumergue is the first Christian to serve as President of France. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Doumergue's Conditions for Forming a Cabinet</p>
<h3 id="e22">Retain the Right to Dissolve Parliament <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) It is widely rumored in political circles that Doumergue's acceptance of the mandate to form a cabinet is conditional not only on dissolving parliament and at least postponing the general election for six months, but also on advocating amending the constitution and reinstating the Paris Police Chief Chiappe. If the President accepts these conditions, Doumergue can govern for at least half a year without interference from parliament. The President has ordered Chamber of Deputies Speaker Bouisson to contact the leaders of various parties and invite them to join the new cabinet. Bouisson consulted with Daladier, Chautemps, Tittoni, and Herriot last night, but the results are unknown. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) One of the shortcomings of the French constitution is that it is extremely difficult to dissolve parliament, which is the main reason for the current political turmoil. Since 1871, the President has only used his privilege to announce the dissolution of parliament once. According to the Paris Echo, after the previous Chautemps cabinet fell, former President Doumergue declined current President Lebrun's invitation to take the premiership, not because of his age, but because President Lebrun was unwilling to fulfill two conditions: dissolving parliament and postponing the general election for six months. However, this matter has made those who advocate for a major reform of the constitution even more vocal. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Two Days of Storm and Waves</p>
<h3 id="e23">Paris Gradually Calming Down <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Frenzied Crowds Turn to Welcome Former President</p>
<p>Special Alert Lifted This Morning</p>
<p>(Paris) After a storm, France is calm this morning, and everyone has a pleasant feeling, believing that someone has come forward in time to clean up the crisis. The only thing in Paris that still indicates that life has not returned to normal is the delayed delivery of the first batch of mail, as the post office is still occupied by soldiers for defense. Former President Doumergue, who has agreed to form a new cabinet, is welcomed by the crowds as if he were a beloved monarch. When Doumergue drove to the presidential palace, those who saw him along the way smiled and paid their respects. The crowds, who were frenzied with anger yesterday, have transformed today into cheering and applauding. In addition to police protection along the way, a squadron of cavalry escorted Doumergue. Doumergue talked with the President for half an hour and then began the political considerations necessary for forming a cabinet. Only ten members of the Chamber of Deputies arrived this morning, so the meeting was adjourned after only two minutes, until after the new cabinet is formed. At the same time, the municipal government hired people to quickly clear the debris from the streets. Paris is gradually calming down after Daladier's resignation, so the special alert measures were lifted at 1:45 this morning. Although the disturbances last night were not as serious as on Tuesday, there was still bloodshed. According to the Paris Morning News, three people died and many were injured after armed demonstrators clashed with police, and many were arrested. It is reported that the demonstration led by the Communist Party was the most violent. Furthermore, last night's demonstration was different from the previous night because the previous night was a national movement, while last night was the work of a few parties. Many troublemakers participated last night, resulting in looting. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Daladier Hangs Up His Hat</p>
<h3 id="e24">Popular Grievances Boil Over; He Resigns <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Leaves the Presidential Palace with a Pale Face</p>
<p>Daladier conferred at the Presidential Palace for many hours on Tuesday night, and it was not until dawn that he emerged, with a serious but also haggard face. He then issued an order to increase the number of troops to supplement the inadequacy of the 14,000 police officers. However, after seeing the boiling popular grievances, he announced his resignation. Opposition members of parliament blamed Daladier for ordering the police to fire on the crowds. Unfortunately, Daladier held the premiership for a very short time and personally heard the demonstrators shouting slogans to drive him out. The mob shouted wildly, "Resign, resign," and sometimes even shouted, "Kill him." What was especially unpleasant was the cry of "We also have weapons. We know what we should do now." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The following is a report on the situation before and after the resignation of the Daladier cabinet. Prime Minister Daladier held a meeting this morning with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Puisson, Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot, Socialist Party leaders Blum and Frossard, right-wing member of parliament Ibanez, Minister of the Army Pengu, and Minister of the Navy Chappetellan. Following this, at 1:15 PM, he went to the presidential palace to meet with President Lebrun and submit the cabinet's collective resignation. A quarter of an hour later, Daladier came out and issued a public statement to the press, saying, "The government is responsible for public safety, but in the current situation, order cannot be maintained without taking extraordinary measures. The cabinet cannot bear to use troops to suppress the demonstrating masses and stage another bloody tragedy, so the whole body has resigned to the President." The resigning cabinet continued to meet from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM to study the current situation, with particular emphasis on the responsibility for maintaining public safety before the establishment of a new cabinet. This morning, Ishii, the Secretary-General of the National Federation of Trade Unions, visited Daladier and did not agree with the cabinet's resignation, saying that he reserved the freedom of personal action in order to cope with future events. Cabinet members were very concerned about Ishii's visit to the Prime Minister. People in the trade union explained Ishii's words as a sign that the National Federation of Trade Unions would take severe action against pan-fascism. The Mine Workers' Union also sent a representative to visit Daladier, with the same tone as the representative of the National Federation of Trade Unions. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Viewpoints of French and British Newspapers</p>
<h3 id="e25">Daladier Retires Courageously <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Still Admirable and Upright</p>
<p>French Democratic Politics Are Deeply Rooted</p>
<p>Amending the Constitution Seems Unlikely</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers believe that Daladier's resignation of the cabinet will ease people's hearts at this time of popular anger. Le Petit Parisien said, "Daladier did not want to use troops to suppress the masses and stage another bloody tragedy, so he hung up his hat and left. His actions were admirable and upright, and we cannot accuse him of showing weakness." Most newspapers agree with Daladier's resignation, but the rhetoric of the left and right newspapers is different. The Socialist Party's "People's Daily" blamed "Daladier for yielding to the threats of the reactionaries." Right-wing newspapers fiercely attacked Daladier and Interior Minister Frot, saying that they were driven out by public opinion. The crowd sees former President Doumergue's appointment as prime minister as the only way to stabilize people's hearts, but the Socialist Party's "People's Daily" does not think so. "L'Écho de Paris" greatly praised Doumergue, saying, "Former President Doumergue is widely expected, and in this time of national difficulty, he will unite people's hearts and support the overall situation, a responsibility that no one else can bear." "Le Journal" also praised Doumergue, saying, "Since Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau, no politician has been more loved by the people than Doumergue. The factional disputes in the Chamber of Deputies have plunged the country into its current situation. If Doumergue can come out of the mountain, the public will be convinced, and the disputes will naturally cease." The Radical Party's "L'Ère Nouvelle" said that dissolving the Chamber of Deputies is a political means commonly used by the United Kingdom, and Doumergue is afraid that he will not take this path. Judging from the current situation and people's hearts, France cannot but organize an authoritarian government, and no one is better suited to be the leader of an authoritarian government than Doumergue. Doumergue's cabinet will be supported by the vast majority from the day it is established. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers are very supportive of the news that former French President Doumergue has been mandated to form a cabinet. For example, the Manchester Guardian said that the world knows that Doumergue is a great French-style politician, and that he will be able to combine the Radical and Central factions to form a new cabinet and maintain cooperation between the various parties, as this is what is needed at the moment. The Times said that dissolving parliament is not allowed by French political convention, and France will continue to strive to maintain democratic politics. Therefore, although extreme right-wingers advocate changing the constitutional mechanism, it is doubtful whether it will become a reality. The Daily Telegraph also holds the same view, saying that it is impossible for France to allow the Fascist or Communist parties to seize the life of the government and change course. However, the Daily Mail, which has recently changed its attitude and advocated fascism, criticized the French democratic system. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>The Goal of Overthrowing the Cabinet Has Been Achieved</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Mob's Remaining Anger Has Not Subsided <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Wanting to Get Frot to Be Satisfied</p>
<p>Lawyers Demand Expulsion from Membership</p>
<p>The most important goal of the rioters was to overthrow Daladier, but although the goal has been achieved, the remaining anger has not subsided, and the streets are still full of danger. Interior Minister Frot is the most hated by the people, and they will not be satisfied until they get him. Four hundred lawyers have formed a team to go to the Ministry of Justice to demand that the president of the bar expel Frot from the legal profession. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the courts here were noisy. More than 100 lawyers formed a group and asked the president of the bar association to expel the resigning Interior Minister Frot from the association. Although the president tried to persuade them to calm down, the lawyers still held a demonstration, singing the national anthem in front of Frot's lawyer uniform and burning the uniform. After the news of the cabinet's resignation spread, crowds of people gathered on the streets and sang the national anthem. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>Rumors Abound; People Are Uneasy</p>
<p>Near Midnight; The Disturbance Gradually Subsides</p>
<p>Street gatherings are prohibited. But as soon as it was afternoon, crowds gathered on the Place de la Concorde, and the police dispersed them. They scattered and gathered again, and some people threw sharp objects at the police, shouting, "We will bring our guns tonight."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, crowds marched through the major streets, singing the Marseillaise, and sometimes clashed with the police. Before long, cavalry galloped through the Place de la Concorde to clear the gathering crowds. In view of the fact that rioters set fires on Tuesday, the naval headquarters stationed troops at key points outside the building to guard it.</p>
<p>A group of rioters assaulted Senator Roland in the Rue Royale, tearing his clothes, because Roland had ordered troops and patrol teams to fire on Tuesday night in order to protect the government. Roland hurriedly boarded a streetcar, but was rescued by the police before he could escape. In the evening, crowds gathered again on the Place de la Concorde, and the situation was more serious than in the afternoon. The cries of "Revenge," "Revenge" did not stop, and they attacked the Republican Guard. The members of the group had no choice but to push and chase several times, resulting in two injuries. The casualties of the rioters must be far greater than this number.</p>
<p>In the evening, Paris Police Chief Chiappe decided to provide helmets to the police to ensure their safety. Although rumors were rife throughout the city and the police were very nervous, everything was still easy to control, and there were no casualties. However, the helmeted police teams injured many people when they pushed and chased the demonstrating crowds at the intersection of Place de la Concorde and Rue de la Madeleine. The crowds insulted and abused the police, threw sharp objects, and destroyed street lamps and windows. They also lit torches along the major streets to cheer them on. At 10:30 PM, Rue de Rivoli was very quiet, and the Place de la Concorde was also quieter with 1,000 police officers stationed there. In the recent disturbances, in addition to injuring many civilians, 10 police officers were injured, and hundreds of people were arrested. Near midnight, there were occasional gunshots on the major streets, but by 1:00 this morning, everything was quiet. The Communist Party attempted to dig trenches somewhere and resist the police with pistols, but they were disarmed and arrested. The Veterans Association and the Jeunesse Patriotes, the two main groups in the Tuesday riots, were warned by their leaders not to stage any more demonstrations. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>As a result of the clashes in various places, several police officers were injured. The number of civilians injured is difficult to calculate. There were two deaths and many arrests. Except for four people whose cases were more serious and who have been detained, the rest were released soon. According to the Paris Police Chief's estimate, about 2,000-3,000 people marched on the streets tonight. According to official statistics, 10 people died and 182 people were sent to the hospital for treatment as a result of last night's disturbance. The remaining 282 people were slightly injured.

<p>The employees of the stock exchange stopped working at 1:45 PM, shouting "Send Daladier to the guillotine" and "Murderer" without stopping. More and more people gathered in the exchange. Several police officers leaned against the wall and listened to the public cries with smiles. After a while, the illuminated message board revealed the numbers "Daladier has resigned." Then, cheers erupted throughout the venue. After a short while, the venue returned to calm, and the staff resumed work as usual.</p>
<p>When the stock exchange opened yesterday, thousands of people gathered, shouting "Kill Daladier" and "Long Live Chauvin," making it impossible to carry out transactions. The police could not maintain order, and the police station requested reinforcements. But although a large number of police officers came by car to help, they were unable to drive them out because there were too many people in the exchange. In order to commemorate those who were killed last night, the stock exchange made a five-minute silence and wrote in large letters on the blackboard, "Five minutes of silence for the victims."

Otherwise, the action that angered the people on Tuesday will cause former soldiers without weapons to return to the streets, and next time they will bring hand grenades. (8th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Budapest. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has arrived here on a visit to the Hungarian authorities. He met with Prime Minister Gömbös for two hours and then met with Foreign Minister Kánya to begin discussing general diplomatic issues. In the evening, the government authorities hosted a banquet for Dollfuss. They delivered speeches to each other, which were extremely cordial. Dollfuss said in his reply, "The friendship between Austria and Hungary is so profound that there is no need to conclude any treaties or conventions. At present, the international community is adopting a policy of 'convention inflation,' and we have no need to follow suit. The sincerity of economic cooperation between Austria and Hungary is far more valuable than any convention." (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary. After negotiations between the Austrian and Hungarian Prime Ministers, a joint communiqué was issued stating that the two leaders had a coordinated spirit on all political and economic issues between the two countries, and the results of the negotiations were satisfactory. Prime Minister Dollfuss also declared separately to the press that relations between Austria and Hungary had never been as satisfactory as they are today. He also said that rumors outside that the Austrian government was about to collapse were completely unfounded, and that he was determined to defend the people and would vigorously prevent disruptive elements.

Because of differing interpretations in the Soviet Union regarding the non-aggression pact concluded between Germany and Poland, Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has decided to personally go to Moscow on the 12th of this month to provide an explanation in person, in order to prove that although Poland has established a new relationship with Germany, its friendship with neighboring countries and allies remains unchanged. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) When Litvinov spoke with the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Łukasiewicz, at the end of December last year, he said that the Soviet government would welcome Polish Foreign Minister Beck to Moscow.

<p>Bulgarian Prime Minister Declares Support for Peace</p>
<p>But Will Not Abandon Rights Recognized by the League of Nations</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. The Balkan Pact negotiated by the Balkan countries is scheduled to be formally signed in the capital of Greece this Friday. It is reported that Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece, the four contracting states, have decided to make slight revisions to the text of the treaty after exchanging opinions. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Sofia. The Prime Minister of Bulgaria recently issued a statement to the press, stating that after other Balkan countries studied Bulgaria's proposal to sign a non-aggression treaty, although they considered the Balkan Pact to be more sufficient to ensure the security of the Balkan countries, the four Balkan countries are still prepared to sign a non-aggression treaty. It can be seen that Bulgaria is deeply willing to express its support for peace. The Bulgarian government has never wanted to modify the boundaries defined by the treaty by force. He then mentioned Bulgaria's attitude towards the Balkan Pact, saying that this kind of pact is useless, and his conclusion was: "On the day before the formal signing of the Balkan Pact, we will notify the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Pact of our views. What are our views? We refuse to sign the Balkan Pact. This is because we are willing to maintain peace, and we cannot abandon the rights recognized by the League of Nations Covenant." (Note: This should refer to Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, "Review of Treaties Which Have Become Inapplicable"), etc.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Administrative Court receives an average of more than sixty cases of petition each month. Some are because the nature of the cases belongs to the scope of impeachment by the Control Yuan. Some are because the procedures are incomplete (must be tried by the court first, and then the petition can be filed with the court if not satisfied). Some are because the written petitions are not in the correct format (must use the court's form; ordinary court forms are not acceptable). All three of these must be rejected. Therefore, on average, only more than thirty petition cases can be established each month. After a petition case is recognized by the court, the court will notify the official agency being petitioned to respond. If the original petitioner still believes that the official agency is unreasonable, they can argue again. As a result, if the official agency is in the wrong and the court makes a ruling, the court will submit it to the Judicial Yuan and then to the National Government to legally punish the official agency being petitioned. If the people suffer losses, the official agency must be responsible for compensation. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>The national defense of the Soviet Union can be boasted about to the world. However, on the other hand, I The Far East problem I reveals a terrible crisis, which is the seriousness of the Soviet-Japanese problem. From an optimistic perspective, the outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, such as the dispute over the North Pacific fishing grounds and the oil problem, have been temporarily resolved. Only the China Eastern Railway remains a major case spanning there.</p>
<p>According to the opinions expressed by the main persons in charge of the Soviet Union, if Japanese imperialism continues to run rampant and dares to invade Soviet territory, then the Soviet Union will never back down at that time and will rise up to fight. According to observations of the situation here, Japan has not made any special representations on this, except that the Asahikawa 7th Division will be transferred to Manchuria, and a part of the Hirosaki 8th Division will be transferred back to Japan. In total, the Japanese troops stationed along the China Eastern Railway consist of the entire 10th Division, the entire 7th Division, an artillery brigade, and two cavalry brigades, totaling about 60,000 people. In addition, there are the 14th Division in South Manchuria, a part of the 20th Division in Korea, six garrison battalions, a part of the 6th Division, and other special forces, totaling about 140,000 people. On the Soviet side, from Chita to Vladivostok, in addition to the two Pacific Fleets, the 35th and 36th Army Corps, and special forces, there are only 120,000 to 130,000 people in total. However, their combat power is very strong, and there are plenty of new weapons. Moreover, the Soviet side emphasizes defense and has no intention of actively attacking.</p>
<p>Now, let's make a comparison of the military quality of the Soviet and Japanese troops, which can also give a glimpse into the future trend of war between the Soviet Union and Japan.</p>
<p>The source of Soviet troops and the conscription system are the same as those of other countries, all coming from the people, especially selected from among workers and peasants. The term of service is two years. Military training is not much different from that of various land armies. Those habits of the Tsarist era have been completely eradicated. What is particularly special, and what no other country has, is political training. Needless to say, every soldier can understand his mission in wartime. │In the Tsarist era, they may have understood, but not very clearly, and there were many personal hobbies, such as drinking, which were enough to affect their combat power. │Now it is different. In addition to strict and effective military training, there is also a political understanding. They know their mission, they know why they want to fight their enemies.</p>
<p>In the Japanese army, military training is of course very thorough and meticulous. It is no stronger than any excellent land army country in the world. In terms of military action, the Red Army is still inferior to it, because the national education tradition of the Japanese military has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people, so ordinary soldiers can faithfully fulfill their mission. However, they have not paid sufficient attention to politics, and it can even be said that there is no political training, which leads to the following two major shortcomings. First, the level of knowledge in Japan has gradually increased, and the research of social sciences is not entirely a temporary fashion, but is gradually penetrating into the lower masses of the general society. The Japanese soldiers come from the people, they have already recognized reality, and the idea of ​​unease has spread throughout the minds of the general public. Therefore, the effectiveness of anesthetics such as loyalty to the emperor and love of the country has indeed been very small. Mechanical oppression can still be maintained in peacetime. Small wars and short periods can still be sustained. Once faced with a major war, I am afraid that changes will occur.</p>
<p>Second, there is the implication of life eviction. Conscription is nothing more than picking and choosing among workers and peasants. During periods of stable life, they can still reluctantly devote themselves to the country and expand their territory to create a better living environment. But now, Japanese villages are on the verge of bankruptcy. The parents, wives, and children of ordinary soldiers and even lower-ranking officers are miserable on the poverty line, not knowing where their next meal will come from. Cities are also encountering a great economic depression, and the difficulties of life are very serious. Therefore, patriotic thoughts are fundamentally shaken. If there is a real long-term war, who can guarantee that they will not change? (Vladivostok, January 27)</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: He Yingqin, Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, issued an order yesterday (the 5th) to strip Sun Dianying of his position as commander of the 41st Army and commander of the 40th Division, and telegraphed the Military Commission and the Executive Yuan. All of Sun's troops were placed under the command of Yu Shiming, Ding Futing, and Liu Yueting. Fearing that Sun's troops would still advance westward, He Yingqin invited the generals of North China to the Jurentang last night for discussions on how to deal with Sun's troops. The results decided: (1) If Sun Dianying does not hand over military power and resists the orders of the Military Branch, it is decided to jointly dispatch troops from the five provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to encircle and suppress him in accordance with the previous plan to thoroughly resolve the issue. (2) Hou Cheng will be sent to Shanxi to meet with Yan, urging the troops of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces to dispatch troops to the border between Ningxia and Suiyuan to tail Sun's troops and discuss with Yan the passage of large troops through Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces. (3) When necessary, send the entire division of Guan Linzheng and the cavalry regiment of Liu Duoquan's division to assist, opening the Ping-Sui Railway to concentrate in Baotou, and contact the Shanxi-Suiyuan army to attack Dengkou and the Yellow River bend. According to official sources, Sun's troops aimed to occupy Ningxia and drive westward. When Sun's troops set out, his subordinates suggested to Sun that going to the northwest via Ningxia would definitely be blocked by Ma's army. It would be best to advance southwest of the Yellow River bend without passing through the border of Ningxia to avoid obstacles along the way. After arriving in Woye, they should take a single breath and rush through Ningxia. Sun, because Ma Hongkui had previously telegraphed to obstruct his westward advance, was quite angry. Therefore, he told those who made suggestions that his purpose was to overwhelm Ma Hongkui before advancing westward. Therefore, he did not adopt the suggestion to avoid marching through the border of Ningxia and advanced from various places such as Chengkou and Ligangbu, confronting Ma's army for more than 20 days. Most of Ma's reinforcements have arrived. In recent days, the war on the front line has been fierce, the most intense since the conflict began. Because the authorities dismissed Sun Dianying from his positions, he was bound to take risks and planned to occupy Ningxia in the shortest possible time. If the combined forces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are too strong to resist, he will advance westward along the border of Ningxia via the Mongolian border. If Ningxia's strength is insufficient to resist, he will occupy Ningxia and then observe the situation and continue to advance westward. He did not respond to He Yingqin's telegram of the 5th.</p>
<p>After Sun Dianying was dismissed, his main force is still gathered north of the capital of Ningxia Province, launching fierce attacks on the city walls from time to time. According to Guihua telegram, the defending army of Ningxia is Zhan's brigade of Ma Hongkui's troops. Sun's army encircled about 15,000 people. Pingluo was indeed occupied by Sun's army. Ma Baolin, the brigade commander defending Pingluo, was killed in action. About 4,000 people were wiped out and killed in a terrible massacre. A small unit of Sun's army, Yang Hou, was blown up by a landmine, killing more than 700 people. Yan Xishan once sent Councilor Chen Jiashen to Suiyuan to investigate the situation of the Sun-Ma war and has now returned to Bing to report. However, tonight the Military Branch officially denied the loss of Pingluo and announced a telegram from Ningxia stating that the troops from Gansu and Qinghai provinces had actively reinforced the capital of Ningxia Province and that Ma Hongkui's troops inside the city were prepared to launch a major counterattack. The Military Branch will not issue an order to suppress Sun's army because it has sent Yu Shiming and others to take charge of the reorganization. If the army resists, it will be jointly attacked by the five provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai.</p>
<p>Yan Xishan's attitude is quite noteworthy, because Suiyuan borders Ningxia, and Suiyuan is defended by the Shanxi army. If Yan is consistent with the central government, Sun's army will be easily resolved. It is heard that after authorities here sent representatives to negotiate with Yan repeatedly, Yan has expressed his consistency with the central government and decided to send Wang Jingguo's 70th Division and Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry division to assist Ningxia. Once they receive the dispatch fees from the central government, they can mobilize. However, Yan's attitude has always been mysterious, and the actual issues still need to be discussed in detail.

<p>Entering Fujian</p>
<h3 id="e109">Various Armies Ordered to Demobilize <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Fourth Route Army Returns to East Road Control</p>
<p>Jiang and Wei to Immediately Take New Positions on East Road</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The 19th Route Army in the Xingquan area has been reorganized by the central government. A few have retreated to Longyan, and scattered soldiers are being pacified separately. The military affairs of Fujian Province have come to an end at this point. From now on, the matters of bandit suppression, red suppression, and local pacification will be fully handled by Jiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the East Road, according to a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang. Except for a small part of the troops belonging to the 4th and 5th Route Armies, the rest are under the control of the East Road, remaining in Fujian awaiting transfer to strengthen the bandit suppression force. The original 2nd, 4th, and 5th Route Armies were under the North Road Army. After Jiang Dingwen takes office in his new position, that title will be abolished, and a separate organization will be created by the East Road Army to facilitate military operations. The Demobilization Order for the Punitive Army was reportedly issued on the 1st. The officers and soldiers of the Fourth Route Headquarters, led by Chief of Staff Zhu Shaozhou and Deputy Chief of Staff Tang Guangji, took the Lining ship back to Nanjing first on the afternoon of the 3rd. General Commander Zhang Zhizhong also left Fujian for Nanjing on the 4th to return to his position as Education Director of the Military Academy. The 56th, 36th, and New 11th Divisions of the First Column under his command, under Liu Heding, will all remain in Fujian. It is rumored that the 87th and 88th Divisions of the Second Column under Wang Jingjiu may leave Fujian for other locations within the next few days. As soon as Jiang Dingwen completes the arrangements, he will take office as Commander-in-Chief, and Wei Lihuang will also take office as Commander of the East Road Forward at the same time. The Artillery First Brigade, the 4th and 6th Gendarmerie Regiments, and the Army Signal Corps, which are directly under the central government, will remain in Fujian. The Air Force will also leave a portion stationed in Jian'ou, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou for deployment. After the Navy demobilizes, the Marine Corps will be stationed in coastal counties, and the fleet will be transferred to Nanjing and Shanghai. The Yongjian and other ships departed on the 4th and 5th. Chen Jiliang of the First Fleet was scheduled to take the Ninghai ship back to Nanjing at dawn on the 6th. On the 3rd, he suddenly developed severe pneumonia. On the 4th, he came to the province from Mawei to seek medical treatment at Boai Hospital, but it was not very effective. The Navy specially sent Doctor Chen Cheng by seaplane to Fujian on the 5th to diagnose, who also considered the symptoms to be quite dangerous. On the morning of the 6th, he was escorted to the Hai Rong warship in Mawei by Doctor Chen and ten nurses specially sent by the Naval Hospital, and it sailed to Shanghai at 3:00 PM for medical treatment. Li Shijia, the commander of the Mawei Naval Port, is now handling various important naval affairs in Fujian on behalf of him. (7th)</p>
<p>Seventh Route Established</p>
<h3 id="e110">Office in Guangdong <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Nineteenth Route Army Office in Guangdong to be Abolished</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since Cai Tingkai retreated and defended Longyan, he immediately decided to step down. At the same time, the Nineteenth Route Army was reorganized into the Seventh Route Army of the Eastern Route. Therefore, the rear office of the Nineteenth Route Army stationed in Guangdong was no longer necessary. The director of the office, Weng Guiqing, visited Chen Jitang on the morning of the 2nd and then issued an order to complete the closure within five days. All staff were given severance pay and dismissed. The offices in Guangdong of the 60th, 61st, 49th, and supplementary divisions of the army were also ordered to clear up their documents. As for the food and miscellaneous expenses for the families of the army officers in the rear, Chen Jitang will pay until January. The unpaid portion of the January food and miscellaneous expenses for the officers' families, except for the 60th and 61st divisions which have been paid, will be paid to the 49th and 48th divisions on the 2nd. As for the supplementary division under Tan Qixiu, because it was established not long ago and almost the entire division was annihilated in Fujian, the rear expenses will not be paid. After the rear office of the army is completely abolished, the abandoned site will be used by the newly reorganized Seventh Route Army of the Eastern Route to establish another office in Guangdong, with Mao Weishou, Zhang Yan, and Huang Hairu appointed as directors. They are ordered to prepare and organize the office immediately. Mao and Zhang also telegraphed Chen Jitang, reporting the reorganization and establishment of the army and requesting permission to establish an office in Guangdong. Huang Hairu visited Chen Jitang on the morning of the 3rd. Thus, the signboard of the Seventh Route Army of the Eastern Route for suppressing bandits in the five provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, reappeared. (February 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e111">Bloody Battle of Madu Pass <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Xu Bandit Shoots Commander, Soldiers Mutiny</p>
<p>Government Troops Take Advantage of the Situation to Attack and Capture Strategic Pass</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication: In Sichuan, the military campaign to suppress bandits, since the complete recovery of the five counties of Xuan, Sui, Ying, Peng, and Yi, has completed more than two-thirds of its work. Recently, the battle of Madu Pass was very fierce, with both sides advancing and retreating seven or eight times. Furthermore, because the Xu bandit was tyrannical by nature, he blamed the loss of the pass (the strategic Madu Pass) on Zhang, the commander of his Ninth Army, and shot him. The entire bandit division mutinied. Government troops took advantage of the situation to brave the snow and launch a fierce attack, climbing vines and ropes, using strength as ladders, and climbing up. Finally, they recovered Madu Pass, the only natural barrier between Tong, Ba, Xuan, and Sui. The success was due to the infighting among the bandits and the fierce advance taken advantage of. This matter is rarely known to outsiders. It was later confessed by surrendered prisoners, which is highly credible. Therefore, it is recorded in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Attacking High Mountains <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the Fifth Route Army occupied Majia Chang, it worked hard to advance. When the 7th Brigade of the unit reached Hujia Chang, the Red bandits immediately retreated from the front. The Fifth Route Army continued to occupy Dadongzhai, Maoheshan, Yanwoshan, Chajianci, Luogushan, Jigongliang, Hongya, and various other large mountains, about 1200 to 1300 meters high, all of which were cliffs with several layers, extremely steep. On the ridges of each mountain, the bandits had built several layers of solid fortifications, which could not be penetrated by guns or cannons. Moreover, it was snowing heavily and the cold was piercing to the bone, making transportation difficult. Therefore, the government troops bravely advanced, climbing vines and braving the snow, launching fierce attacks without stopping. The bandits initially did not expect the government troops to have such a desperate and fierce advance, and their morale was greatly discouraged.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Bandit Division Mutinies <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Just then, Zhang, the commander of the pseudo-Ninth Army (originally defected from a certain unit of the former Hubei Army), saw that the Xu bandit's power was declining day by day, and that the Xu bandit was capricious, fearing that the entire army would disintegrate and that he would not be able to protect himself. Therefore, he changed his attitude and had the intention to surrender. However, the matter was leaked and detected by the Xu bandit, who used the loss of the pass as an excuse, saying that it was due to Zhang's poor performance in combat. He immediately shot Zhang on the spot. Zhang's confidant generals incited the unit to mutiny immediately. The 8th Brigade of the Fifth Route Army took the opportunity to attack forcefully and seized Dadongzhai. Seeing the tense situation, most of the bandits retreated. The 8th Brigade then advanced and occupied various highlands in front of the pass. The Fifth Route Army headquarters received the news and immediately ordered the 7th Brigade to advance and occupy Ciqi Chang from the right wing of Madu Pass, first occupying Chixi Chang and other places. The 9th Brigade advanced and occupied Desheng Chang, all advancing at night and reaching their destinations.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Continuing the Fierce Advance <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>On January 23rd, the 7th Brigade again attacked from the right wing of Madu Pass, occupied Huashiping, Douzui, Foeryan and other places, and continued to pursue. The 8th Brigade occupied Lijia Ping, Madu Pass and other places from the front. The 9th Brigade surrounded and advanced to Daluping, Duanyaping and other places. The Meng Brigade of the 4th Division occupied Qingyun Chang, and the Hao Brigade advanced to Chenjia Ba, Songjia Zui, on the right of the 7th Brigade. The Liao Division advanced to Mao Ba. Seeing the fierce attack of the Fifth Route Army, the Red bandits retreated to Tudibao. The government troops continued to advance and occupied the place. On the morning of the 24th, they continued to chase along the entire line, fighting fiercely until night, occupying Huachishan and Daluping. On the 25th, they continued to occupy Minggu Chang, Zhimuhe, Jiangjia Ba and other places. The bandit army suffered heavy losses in supplies, casualties and injuries. This is the account of the battle of Madu Pass.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Strength of the Bandit Army <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>When the bandit army first came to Sichuan from Shaanxi, they forcibly dragged civilians into becoming bandits, and also dragged more than 500 women and children. The journey took more than three months, and halfway through, the women and children were abandoned or killed in deep valleys. When they arrived in Sichuan, they forcibly formed the farmers of Tongba into the army and fought against the Tian, Yang, and Liu divisions, winning victories. At that time, ammunition was very scarce. After Xuan and Sui, they were replenished with the weapons and ammunition lost by Liu Cunhou, and the military equipment was sufficient. The bandits then considered themselves capable of confronting the Sichuan army. Subsequently, after the main forces of the Fifth Route Army continued to advance and launch four fierce attacks, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. The original veteran bandits and fierce bandits only had a dozen or so people left in each company. The rest were supplemented by guerrillas from Tongba and Xuan Sui. Now each company has only sixty or seventy people. Ammunition is still lacking, with each gun only being distributed with a dozen or so or several rows of bullets. After several defeats, their combat capability has been sharply reduced, and they have been losing ground.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Life of the Bandit Soldiers <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for the bandit army's defeat are as described above. In addition, there is another reason, that is, the bandit army manages the troops extremely strictly, killing people at every turn. After finishing the prescribed hard work every day, the bandit soldiers are forced to drill and attend classes, and are forced to receive Red education. If they slightly disobey the orders of their superiors, they are whipped. Each regiment also has a dozen or so children of fourteen or fifteen years old, who are sent to each company to secretly investigate. Those who are not diligent in their work or who talk privately are reported and immediately executed. During combat, they also secretly investigate in the rear, and those who do not advance or retreat are killed without leniency. The officers and soldiers in the bandit army only know how to obey orders and dare not show any displeasure or discuss military affairs. Moreover, the bandit soldiers have only received fifteen strings of Sichuan money in salary for a year. The bandit leaders also know that the amount given is too little to maintain military morale, so they declare that they should only be allowed to eat, not to ask for money. Those who come from other provinces miss their families very much, and those who were dragged from Tongba do not know the whereabouts of their families. The strong resent, and the weak are sad, and can only weep secretly. The stolen silver, food, and clothing are completely transported to the rear. The officers and soldiers in the bandit army dare not ask about it. Therefore, there are many bandit soldiers who want to escape, but they cannot find an opportunity because the surveillance is extremely strict. The mutiny of the entire Zhang Division of the pseudo-Ninth Army the other day was based on this, not accidental. (February 3rd)</p>
<p>Henan Province Launches Widespread Fundraising</p>
<h3 id="e117">To Relief of Hua County Refugees <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>|The Provincial Government Will Commend Those Who Donate 100 Yuan|</p>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: Last summer, the Yellow River flooded, and Hua County suffered heavy disasters. Not only has the accumulated water not receded to this day, but it also suddenly rose four feet on the night of January 12th, and the water poured in with ice, like galloping horses. Forts and embankments were all breached, and many surviving refugees died in the water. Now, men, women, old and young, are mostly floating on the muddy water at night, crying for help. Although various relief agencies and charitable organizations have provided funds one after another, it is a drop in the bucket and does not help. Yesterday, the Provincial Relief Association, in addition to jointly telegraphing the Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, Kong Xiangxi, and the Director of the Disaster Relief Team, Xi Dejiong, to allocate winter relief to save the people's lives, also proposed a one-time widespread fundraising on the Disaster Relief Conference by Zhang Fang, Du Fudong, Yang Zigong, Guo Fangwu, and others. The Provincial Government then issued a notice to all county magistrates to raise funds separately from the first to the seventh day of the lunar new year. Those who donate more than 100 yuan will be commended by the Provincial Government. The details of the method are as follows: "Fundraising Method" Article 1: Each county shall convene government, chamber of commerce, school, local charitable organizations, and gentry to raise funds for seven days. (Now is the lunar new year, when each family is cooking lamb and enjoying the holiday. Everyone should think of the situation of their compatriots in Hua County who lack food and clothing, and are in all kinds of misery, and donate as much as they can.) Article 2: Donations from one copper coin, one sheng of rice or flour, and one set of clothes are all welcome, no matter how much or how little. Those who generously donate a large amount will be reported by the county magistrate to the association, which will forward it to the government for commendation. Article 3: The money, rice, flour, clothes, etc. raised each day shall be kept by the county government in the designated firm or chamber of commerce. After the seven-day period, it shall be reported to the association, which will send someone to receive it together with the local representative, and transport it to Hua County for distribution. Article 4: This method will be decided by the conference and then sent to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs to notify all counties to implement it. Article 5: Notify those who work outside of Henan, as well as those involved in charitable organizations related to Henan, to jointly bear the responsibility of fundraising and relief.

<p>The Provincial Government recently appointed inspectors to visit various counties to prepare for the improvement of county administration. Inspector Zhang Datong arrived in Songjiang the other day and stayed at the State Guest House. In recent days, he has secretly visited the various districts of Fengjing, Xinzhuang, and Tinglin. He returned to Songjiang on the 5th. All the agencies in the city went to investigate. All county administration, public security, judicial affairs, prisons, education, district administration, commerce, public sentiment, and customs are all under investigation. County Magistrate Jin hosted a banquet last night, and they were very happy. Today, he will inspect the prison, the county chamber of commerce, and the Provincial Women's High School. Tomorrow, he will return to the province to report his findings. Inspector Zhang is from Pinghu, Zhejiang and graduated from the University of Chicago in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Funds for Repairing Embankments Have Been Allocated <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since the construction of the embankments in the coastal areas of the county, 80% to 90% of the first and second construction groups' projects have been completed. The fourth construction group has also started construction. The quantity of earthwork for the fifth, sixth, and seventh construction groups has also been calculated. However, although the county government has tried its best to transfer 20,000 yuan from the construction funds, the five-county flood relief committee has allocated 7,000 yuan for work relief, and the province has allocated 3,000 yuan for relief, it is still far from enough. Although the Finance Department has approved the collection of taxes on work relief mu, it can only be collected after one year, which is too slow to help. Therefore, there is a proposal to do only half of the embankment work in the whole county. However, various parties believe that doing only half of the work will not make the project very strong, and the impact on the disaster-stricken people will be even greater. Therefore, it has been decided to do the whole county. Regarding the funds, various parties are doing their best to raise them. It is now learned that the county government has sent people to consult with the five-county flood relief committee and has been approved to continue to allocate more than 10,000 yuan. About 20,000 yuan is still lacking. Contact has also been made with the Shanghai Bank Consortium for interest-bearing loans, which is already certain. The entire county's embankment project will be completed within two months.</p>

<p>The East Village of Xiezhuang Township in the fourth district of this county was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits with weapons on the night before. They broke into the house of Lu Amao and searched and robbed all the clothes, bedding, cloth, and cash. They went to the house of Wang Heshang in the same village, ransacked the boxes and cabinets, and looted them. The losses were quite large. When the farmers in the surrounding villages heard the sound and beat gongs to call for arrest, the bandits had already carried the loot away.</p>

<p>In Yuxiangshang, near Yanqiao in the fifth district, villager Yang Fuquan (also known as Feng Fuquan) and his wife, Feng, severely abused their eleven-year-old adopted daughter-in-law, Rongzhen, to death. Afterwards, the father of the deceased, Feng Jinshi, reported the case to the bureau and had Feng arrested and detained by the court. However, when Feng entered prison, she was already heavily pregnant and about to give birth. On the morning of the previous day (7th), she gave birth to a son in prison. At 9:00 am yesterday (8th), Prosecutor Shen, who was handling the case, led Inspector Wang and bailiffs to the village by car to exhume the coffin for an autopsy. Upon arriving at the scene, he ordered the workers to exhume the coffin from the ground and open it for autopsy. It was found that the deceased, Feng Rongzhen, had a fatal wound on the left side of her head caused by a wooden object, a minor wound on her left arm caused by a wooden object, abrasions on her chest and ribs, and a wound on her left leg caused by a wooden object. The muscles of her buttocks were rotten due to injuries sustained during her lifetime. It was determined that she had died from convulsions the day after being injured during her lifetime. After the autopsy, the body was re-coffined and sealed, pending review and handling.</p>

<p>The county government previously received an order from the Department of Finance stating that there were fraudulent activities in the grain business in Xiyi, which must be investigated. The county was instructed to prepare a budget and submit it to the province for review and approval. All expenses were to be paid from local funds. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan forwarded it to the relevant groups for information. Later, because there was a budget for local expenses, it was difficult to pay, so he submitted it to the Department again for instructions. Now, an instruction has been received to use the recovered old taxes to cover the expenses, totaling more than 3,000 yuan. It is scheduled to be carried out next month.</p>

<p>In Maojia Ba, Tangqiao Township, Wuyi District 17, at about 12 o'clock on the night of the 6th, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, each holding a box gun and flashlight. They first broke into the house of Mao Xibin and searched Xibin and his brother Yubin's rooms at will. Then they climbed over the wall and entered the house of Mao Qianzhen, the village head. Qianzhen was tied up and threatened not to make a sound. All the jewelry, receipts, paper, and pens in the room were looted. It is estimated that Mao Xibin lost 120-130 yuan, Mao Yubin lost 40-50 yuan, and Mao Qianzhen lost 150-160 yuan. The house of Cao Hongxing near the dam was also robbed that night, and clothes, jewelry, and other items were lost. After Township Chief Chen Yuting of the township learned of this, he went to investigate in person on the morning of the 7th and carefully inspected the situation of the two robbed houses. It seemed that they were done by the same gang of bandits. He then wrote a report detailing the investigation results and reported it to the district office, which forwarded it to the county government for strict investigation and arrest of the stolen goods and bandits for legal handling.</p>

<p>There are more than 600 prisoners in the Zhenjiang County Prison, which is overcrowded. County Magistrate Ye plans to build a new building to ease the congestion, but it is difficult to do so due to financial difficulties. The prison is now actively repairing the interior. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, two prisoners, Cai Deyuan, who was imprisoned for issuing fake tickets, and Xia Xiaobao, who was imprisoned for fraud, took advantage of the lack of supervision to chisel through the wall of the prison's west garden and escape. After the guards discovered it, they sent police to pursue them in different directions. Xia Xiaobao was arrested at the end of Bailian Lane in the city and handed over to the nearby Second Sub-bureau substation for escort to the county. Cai Deyuan is still at large. The Zhenjiang County Government has instructed its subordinates and requested the assistance of various military and police agencies to arrest him.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau's Xinbaohe ship and Shengli tugboat, which departed from Zhenjiang and headed for Huaicheng, were robbed by bandits at Shao Bo Lake in the Yangzhou jurisdiction at around 4:00 pm the other day. The bureau's Xinbaoan ship was temporarily leased from the Datong Company. The Shengli tugboat was owned. There were ten passengers on the ship when it departed from Yangzhou. When it sailed to Fenghuang Bridge on Shao Bo Lake, the passengers took out weapons and threatened the passengers. Then they searched them one by one. It is said that no one was injured.</p>

<p>Transferred to Jingjiang County Government for Interrogation</p>
<p>The China Merchants Jiangjing Steamer, leased by the Dada Company, exploded with passengers carrying saltpeter and money cannons near Xin Sheng Port on the 3rd, injuring several crew members and passengers. Last night (6th), Trial Judge Shi interrogated Zhang Yucun, Cai Yunxian, and Zou Caigao, who all firmly denied carrying the dangerous goods and stated that the incident occurred in Xin Port. The court then ordered them to leave, and brought the clerk and inspector to the Gospel Hospital to examine the injured. It was found that there was no danger to their lives. Four of the seven people had crippled limbs or blindness. They returned to the court and reconvened, informing Cai and the other three that the place of the incident was in Jingjiang, and they should be transferred to the Jingjiang County Government for interrogation according to the law. They were temporarily detained, pending preparation of the documents for transfer.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Ministry of Finance Borrows <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>44 Million Yuan from the Banking Sector</p>
<p>With Italian Refund of Boxer Indemnity as Guarantee</p>
<p>Various Banks Have Started to Disburse the Funds Separately</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, in view of the monthly shortage of military and political expenses, issued 10,000 yuan of customs treasury bills for the 23rd year of the Republic of China to offset the old debts of the Central and other banks. He is now separately conducting new borrowing from Shanghai bankers, with the Italian refund of the Boxer Indemnity to our country as a guarantee. It has now been established, with a total amount of 44 million yuan. The contract has also been signed.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Total Borrowing Amount <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of the new borrowing was investigated separately by Xin Sheng News Agency reporters from the leaders of various banks yesterday. It is known that it is indeed 44 million yuan. The rumors of 46 million yuan and 47 million yuan seem to be inaccurate. However, this borrowing was directly contacted by Minister Kong with major banks and did not go through the Banking Association.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Italian Indemnity Guarantee <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The lending banks are the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Xingye Bank, Jin City Bank, Dalu Bank, Yanye Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Shanghai Bank, China Industrial Bank, and other more than ten banks, with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications being the largest, totaling about 20 million yuan. The remaining banks vary, with a minimum of 1 million yuan. The monthly interest rate is 8%, and the Ministry of Finance will repay it in installments until the 37th year of the Republic of China. The Italian refund of the Boxer Indemnity is used as a guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Starting to Disburse Funds <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the banks have determined the loan, they have now started to disburse the funds separately, and it is stipulated that it will be cleared in four months. The Italian refund of the Boxer Indemnity was decided by the former Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen, when he was in Italy, after contacting the Italian government. It is heard that after this loan from the Ministry of Finance is established, the customs treasury bills for the 23rd year of the Republic of China will no longer be mortgaged to the banking sector.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Other Loan Reports <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, in order to replenish the national treasury, is now conducting new borrowing from the banking sector in the city. The result is quite satisfactory. The total borrowing amount is 44 million yuan, which is separately undertaken by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhongnan Bank, Jin City Bank, China Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Siming Bank, Dalu Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Yanye Bank, Kenye Bank, and other sixteen banks, with the Italian refund of the Boxer Indemnity as a mortgage. The annual interest rate is 6%, and it will be paid off in five years. It is also heard that the contract has been signed last week. The rumor that the interest rate on the loan is 8% per month until the 37th year of the Republic of China, and that it will be paid off, is not true.</p>

<p>However, Due to Delay, It Will Arrive at 7 AM This Morning</p>
<p>The 301st through train from Ping-Shanghai, which departed from Ping on the afternoon before yesterday at 7:15, was passing through the Chuzhou Station of the Jinpu Railway at 1:30 pm yesterday. Due to the lack of accuracy of the track at the station, a small part of the locomotive fell into the track. The Jinpu Public Works Department rushed to send craftsmen to the scene to lift the wheels and return them to the track, and it was able to continue to run normally. However, it was delayed by nine hours. It crossed the Yangtze River from Xiaguan, and was already at 11 pm. Therefore, the train will arrive in the city at 7 am this morning. Therefore, after receiving the news yesterday, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway immediately advanced the departure of the night train from Beijing to Shanghai at 11 pm, and stopped at each station according to the time of the 301st train, and the 301st train ran according to the time of the night train.</p>

<p>Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan and Others Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Visit</p>
<p>Fever Subsided Slightly Yesterday, Gradually Turning for the Better</p>
<p>Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of the Navy and Commander of the First Fleet, fell ill in Fujian due to overwork. He took the Hairong ship from Fujian to Shanghai the night before last and was admitted to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, his condition improved. Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan and Training Fleet Commander Wang Shouting came to Shanghai yesterday morning to visit him. The details are as follows: Navy Chief Chen Visits: Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan learned that Chen was ill in Fujian and immediately telegraphed Chen Cheng, the chief physician of the Shanghai Naval Hospital, to fly to Fujian for diagnosis and treatment. Since Chen has now come to Shanghai for medical treatment, he took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai the night before last at 11 o'clock. He arrived at the North Station at 7:30 am yesterday and immediately went to Renji Hospital with Training Fleet Commander Wang Shouting to visit Chen's condition. Minister Chen only had a few words with Chen because he was extremely exhausted, and then left. Many relatives and friends of Chen visited the hospital yesterday, and all followed the doctor's instructions and did not meet him.</p>
<p>Doctor's Report: Yesterday, according to Chen Cheng, the chief of the Naval Hospital and medical director of Renji Hospital, when the onset of Chen's illness first began, he suddenly felt strange pain in his ribs and waist. Initially, Dr. Wang Zhuozu diagnosed him, some thought that the illness was in his waist, and some thought that it was in the organs or heart. However, because the facilities at the Fuzhou Hospital were too lacking, I was summoned to go there. I arrived in Fujian at about 5 pm on the 5th. After my examination, although I was not able to determine what the disease was, I absolutely believed that it was not the above-mentioned diseases. On the afternoon of the 6th, the symptoms became more dangerous, with a fever as high as 104 degrees, a pulse of 130, and a respiration rate of 40. I then discussed with Commander Li Shijia that if he remained in Fujian, it would be difficult to save him. Commander Li also agreed, but was concerned about the journey. However, in order to emphasize the importance of the illness, he took the risk and took the Hairong ship to Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. On the morning of that day, toxic acids were suddenly discovered in the blood, which was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, with the help of the medical officer and the complete equipment on the ship, he was injected with glucose water and body salt water of up to seven pounds before he was able to escape the danger. Now that these two dangerous periods have passed, I can guarantee that Yu Youren's stroke will gradually recover.</p>

<p>Apply for Two Weeks of Leave from the Central Government for Careful Recuperation</p>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the morning before, and suddenly suffered a stroke when he got off the train. His mouth was crooked, and he was mentally confused, which was quite dangerous. After inviting famous doctors Lu Zhong'an and Zang Boyong for diagnosis and treatment one after another, his condition has improved. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e139">Banquet for Buddha Unsuccessful <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to people around Mr. Yu, the President of the Court, who is currently in Beijing, had originally planned to host a banquet on the evening of the 6th to entertain the Panchen Lama, Zhangjia Hutuktu, and two living Buddhas who had just arrived in Beijing from North China. Invitations were about to be sent out when he suddenly felt unwell, experiencing throbbing in his scalp. Those around him suggested calling a doctor for diagnosis and treatment, but Mr. Yu was unwilling. Subsequently, the condition worsened, and he had no choice but to cancel the banquet. That evening, he took the night train to Shanghai for medical treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Old Illness Returns <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, after getting off the train, his illness worsened again, with his mouth crooked and his speech slurred. After returning to his residence, he was unable to eat. He then invited the traditional Chinese medicine doctor Lu Zhong'an for diagnosis and treatment. After taking the medicine, his condition improved slightly, but his speech remained slurred and difficult to understand. Mr. Yu had suffered from a similar illness in 1928, which gradually healed after medical treatment. However, due to his busy schedule with national affairs, he was unable to rest adequately, so he never fully recovered. Before this recent onset, Mr. Yu's lips were already slightly skewed to the right.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Dr. Zang's Diagnosis <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1 PM, he invited Western doctor Zang Boyong for diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Zang diagnosed it as a precursor to a stroke. If there are no changes, it may not worsen. According to Dr. Zang's diagnosis, Mr. Yu's blood pressure is not very high. Aside from the crooked mouth and difficulty eating and speaking, his limbs are as flexible as usual, without any hindrance. Therefore, it cannot yet be considered a stroke. However, Mr. Yu is naturally obese, making him very prone to stroke. If he takes good care of himself, it is hoped that there will be no further changes. Mr. Yu's family was initially very anxious, but after Dr. Zang's diagnosis, they felt somewhat relieved. As of last night, Mr. Yu's condition remained unchanged. He was still unable to chew food and was fed small amounts of boiled water and soaked flatbread by attendants.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Two Weeks Leave of Absence <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to Dr. Lu Zhong'an, Mr. Yu's illness is not dangerous. With continued medication and approximately a week of recuperation, he can hopefully recover. Yesterday morning, Central Committee member Wang Luyi and others went to visit him. Mr. Wang told reporters that Mr. Yu's condition has already improved. For the sake of careful treatment, he has requested a two-week leave of absence from the Central Government.</p>
<p>There is no cause for concern. However, the exact nature of the illness is still uncertain at this time. But he does have a stone in his right flank, which can be determined. Once he recovers his health, he can undergo surgery to have it removed.</p>
<p>Good Progress Yesterday's diagnosis and treatment showed good progress. Yesterday, his temperature was 99.6 degrees in the morning and 98.8 degrees in the afternoon. His pulse was 80 and his respiration was 20. His condition is gradually improving. Currently, Dr. Chen provides daily diagnosis and treatment at the hospital, and it is expected that the effect will be seen day by day. Kong Xiangxi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday.</p>

After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Kong returned to his private residence on Avenue Petain to rest. He then went to the Central Bank to handle bank affairs. Mr. Kong's visit to Shanghai this time has no specific task; it is only to attend the Central Mint routine meeting at 5 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>He is scheduled to return to Beijing next Monday.</p>

<p>Excellent Feelings about Handling the Aftermath of the Minbian Incident</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the full committee of the Fujian Provincial Government officially took office on the 5th. The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government specially dispatched Central Committee member Wang Zhengting, along with Secretary Fan Guang, to Fujian to supervise the oath-taking. Mr. Wang completed his official duties on the 6th, departed Fujian on the Ninghai warship to Shanghai, and arrived at the Songkou port around 6 PM the previous evening. He disembarked immediately, transferred to a small steamer to enter the port, and landed at the Xinguankou wharf around 9:30 PM, returning directly to his private residence on Route Ghisi. Mr. Wang met with reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Current Situation in Fujian According to Mr. Wang, after the Minbian Rebellion was suppressed, all the remaining infantry of the 19th Route Army have been reorganized, and Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and other places have also been pacified. The National Army's strategy was swift and admirable. As for the local areas of the province, the upstream areas suffered greatly from this rebellion. The areas near the provincial capital and downstream areas were not significantly affected. However, due to years of disturbance by bandits and the communist party, and the ravaging of local miscellaneous troops, the people's livelihood has been exhausted, and devastation is widespread. At present, the primary task is to restore social order, maintain local security, so that people can live and work in peace, gradually develop transportation, revitalize production, and reorganize finance, which should not be difficult to achieve in order. Currently, the bandit suppression is being carried out actively and effectively, and the highway construction plan is progressing very quickly. The reorganization of disbanded miscellaneous troops is also said to be well-organized. The climate in Fujian is excellent, the products are abundant, and the culture is historically strong. Once organized and the various aftermath measures are in place, one can expect success.</p>
<p>Thoughts on Fujian The most critical issue for China now is the suppression of bandits between Fujian and Jiangxi. When the former 19th Route Army occupied Fujian, they were absolutely unable to implement the bandit suppression. Because while the National Army in Jiangxi was making every effort to encircle and suppress, the Fujian side did not cooperate, and later even reached an agreement with the communist bandits, which further exacerbated the problem. Now that the rebel army has been disbanded, the communist bandits are also in a difficult position. The National Army is now fully cooperating with the various armies in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces to encircle and suppress them. The elimination of the communist bandits is only a matter of time. The recovery of Fujian today, although it is only one province, is actually of great importance to the overall situation and is very gratifying. The northern part of Fujian borders eastern Zhejiang, is mountainous, and rich in forests and agricultural products. Due to the inconvenience of transportation on weekdays, goods are abandoned on the ground, and the local area is extremely poor. After this incident, the authorities felt that the equipment of transportation had a significant relationship with the local area, so they are working on the completion of the highway from northern Fujian to eastern Zhejiang. It is said that the road from Pucheng to Jian'ou can be completed within two months, and the road from Jian'ou to Yanping is also being actively planned, and it is expected to reach Minheng in August. Once this road is completed, the geographical advantages of northern Fujian can be quickly developed, and production can also be transported for export, and northern Fujian can become a fertile and prosperous area. This is really a good sign. Chairman Chen Gongbo has a great deal of experience in military and political affairs, and is willing to take responsibility and be proactive. The directors and committee members of his provincial government are also outstanding individuals of the time, and the future is very promising.</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi Telegraphs Request</p>
<h3 id="e145">Unified Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Should Order Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces to Collect the Tax Jointly</p>
<p>To Avoid the Drastic Decline in Rice Prices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, telegraphed the Nanjing Rural Reconstruction Committee, Executive Yuan President Wang, and Minister of Finance Kong yesterday, (titles omitted): "The crisis of the collapse of rural areas in our country affects the shake of the national foundation. Among the reasons, they are complex and complicated, and the dumping of foreign grain imports and the obstructed sales of domestic rice are one of the major reasons. Last year, the whole country, from top to bottom, made the proposition of rural revitalization. Therefore, the government first relaxed the ban on grain exports and opened up the import tax on foreign rice and wheat. This is indeed a bitter policy to save the people's livelihood. However, the clear order of taxation is unique to the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. It is difficult to restrain the import of the three provinces, which are all rice-deficient areas. Before the announcement of the foreign rice tax, it was originally purchased in the Shanghai, Anhui, and Hunan areas. After the new tax was levied, it was stopped. The new tax failed to be unified, and foreign rice took the opportunity to dump, resulting in the accumulation of rice in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other rice-producing areas, which could not flow. The rice price plummeted, and it was unable to recover. The people's livelihood was even more painful than before. Recently, it was reported that Japan was dumping large amounts of rice from Korea and Taiwan into our country. Since the three provinces of South China are exempt from the new tax, they will inevitably take this as the tail pavilion and take the opportunity to invade, and the leakage cannot be blocked, and the harm is endless. If we do not seek remedy immediately, the plan to revitalize the countryside will be equal to a formality and will not help the actual effect. Fortunately, the Fujian rebellion has been suppressed, and the political order has been unified. Dare to ask your association (Yuan) (Ministry) to quickly (transfer and ask the Yuan Ministry) to order Fujian Province and the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi to collect the tax jointly, so that the national tax revenue is unified and the rural revitalization can be expected. The telegraph cannot wait to await orders, Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association Chairman and Member Gu respectfully,</p>
<p>French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association</p>
<h3 id="e146">Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Chinese Directors</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, after re-electing the members of the third session of the Chinese Directors Committee this year, sent the list of elected candidates to the French Consulate General for review. Regarding the Chinese Committee, Consul and Director-General Mérieux replied in agreement and expressed his gratitude. However, regarding the issue of Chinese Directors, Consul Mérieux suddenly sent a letter yesterday, stating that he could not agree because he had not been consulted beforehand. This attracted the attention of the association, and they convened a temporary emergency meeting at 3 PM yesterday. In addition to the full executive and supervisory committee members of the association, the Chinese Directors and Chinese Committee members were also present to discuss. First, Chairman Cheng Shi-sun reported on the letter from the French Consul. After mutual discussion among the committee members, they believed that the letter from the French Consul was of great importance to the political rights of the Chinese citizens of the entire French Concession. A resolution was passed on the following measures: 1. Reply to the letter from Consul Mérieux with reasons; 2. Appoint Cheng Shi-sun, Qu Zhenhua, Zhu Wenqi, and others as representatives to negotiate when necessary; 3. Before the issue of electoral rights is resolved, the elected Chinese Directors and Chinese Committee members will temporarily suspend attending meetings of the Municipal Council; 4. Warn those who attend as Chinese Directors without being elected by this association and declare that they have no right to represent the taxpaying citizens; 5. Appoint five committee members to organize a research committee to revise the charter of the French Concession. In addition to the original three representatives, Mao Yun and Wu Xiu were appointed as members. Finally, the chairman reported on the letter from the French Municipal Council regarding the revised donation for apartment businesses and the petition for relief of the supplementary donation by representatives of rickshaw merchants. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned around 5 PM.</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants Have Already Shipped</p>
<h3 id="e148">Taiwanese Rice Sample Commissioned to Foreign Firms for Sales <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>=Commission and Sales Agreements Have Been Signed and Established=</p>
<p>=Rice Merchants Refuse to Sell Due to the Large Stockpile of Domestic Rice=</p>
<p>=A Portion of Expired Japanese Rice Has Been Shipped to Hong Kong=</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Japanese Osaka Products Co., Ltd. and the Taiwan Colonial Production Bureau have recently shipped more than two million stones of Taiwanese rice to China for dumping. After the samples arrived in Shanghai, they commissioned British and American foreign firms to carry out sales. The rice merchants have all refused. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e149">Samples Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Taiwan, a Japanese colony, produces an average of about eight million stones of rice annually. Due to unfavorable weather last year, the autumn harvest was only 423,109 stones. The rice produced each year is usually transported to Japan and border areas for sales, under the overall planning of the Japanese Ministry of Commerce. This year, the rice stored in Japan is sufficient to meet domestic consumption, and imports are also prohibited in various border areas, resulting in a surplus of more than 3.8 million stones of rice that cannot be sold, and alternative methods must be sought. In addition to 1.6 million stones being transported to the Northeast for sale, there are still more than two million stones that are planned to be transported to our country for dumping. The samples are divided into three grades: first, second, and third class. Mr. Tadata Taro, the representative of Osaka Products Co., Ltd., brought them to Shanghai together with the Taiwan Colonial Production Bureau to find ways to sell them.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Foreign Firms Sales <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The quality and color of Taiwanese rice are similar to Wuxi rice, the most famous in Jiangsu Province, China. Without the rice industry personnel, it is impossible to distinguish the authenticity. After the rice samples were brought to Shanghai, fearing that direct transactions with Chinese merchants would cause difficulties, the (M.H.D.) American and (L.Q.S.) British foreign firms were specially commissioned to come forward for sales. The commission of the manager and the sales contract have been signed and established.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Rice Merchants Refuse <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>After the managing foreign firm formally established a sales contract with the Japanese side, it sent representatives to the grain industry market for sales. The price was reduced by half a yuan per stone compared to the current domestic rice market. The import duties were all paid by Japan. However, each rice company in the city refused because there was a large stock of domestic rice. According to the person in charge of the rice industry, the current rice price has plummeted, and the suffering of the farmers has accumulated and it is difficult to return. If foreign rice is purchased again, it will create a crisis of rural chaos. The industry has the spirit of love for the country and the nation, and will never make a big mistake to harm the future. Therefore, the foreign firms came forward to sell Japanese Taiwanese rice and have decided to refuse.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Change of Direction <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After further inquiries from reporters to all parties, the Taiwanese rice, after being refused by the rice industry, the various foreign firms changed their original plan to disappointment, and sent personnel to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces for sales.

<p>To Be Held in Beijing on March 20th</p>
<p>The Shipping Association Has Prepared Proposals</p>
<p>In view of the youthfulness of China's shipping industry, in order to develop domestic and foreign shipping routes, the Ministry of Transportation decided to hold a discussion meeting to promote shipping in Beijing on March 20th. The Shipping Association has prepared proposals, and the details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Ministry of Transportation Instructions <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation instructed the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and local shipping groups: "It has been found that China's shipping industry is extremely young and urgently needs to find ways to promote shipping routes, increase tonnage, enrich cooperative power, and improve business methods in order to develop. It is now scheduled to hold a discussion meeting to promote shipping at the Ministry this year on March 20th. Each local shipping industry association and each shipping company will send one representative to the Ministry to participate in the discussion on the cooperation of shipping companies, the promotion of domestic shipping routes, and the opening of ocean shipping routes. In addition to inviting and distributing, the Bureau is ordered to comply immediately, assign representatives, attend the meeting in Beijing on schedule, and submit the list of representatives in advance. If there are any proposals, they should be submitted together so that the agenda can be compiled." This order</p>
<h3 id="e155">Prepared Proposals <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association received the instructions from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, in addition to complying with the order to send representatives to Beijing to participate, it also prepared proposals. Secretary-General Chen Bogang drafted the proposals, believing that in order to promote domestic shipping routes and open up foreign shipping routes, the right of navigation in our country should be taken back first. Regarding foreign shipping routes, state-owned shipping agencies should handle them, because the tonnage of ships traveling overseas is larger, and companies without strong capital cannot do it. Each private shipping company should unite and cooperate to promote domestic shipping routes. At the same time, the government should encourage shipping, etc.</p>

<p>New Salt Affairs Measurement System</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Tax Office Said It Would Find a Solution <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>To Ensure That Officials, Merchants and People Are Not Affected</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance decided to issue an order to implement the new measurement system by the Salt Affairs Audit Office, because the weight is nearly 24 catties different per hundred catties compared with the old system, accounting for about one-fourth of the ratio, and when the tax rate was collected, although the Ministry of Finance had studied it once before implementation, in order to make the weight and tax rate of the new and old measurement systems the same proportion, however, the situations in various places are different. Especially in the Lianghuai salt area, since the implementation, the weight and tax rate are very different. After the old system was changed to the new system, the weight difference was one-fourth, and the tax rate was reduced by only one-twentieth. Therefore, after the announcement, they requested the Salt Affairs Audit Office, etc., to reduce the tax rate. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the Audit Office to inquire about the actual situation yesterday and learned that since the implementation of the new measurement system, the old measurement systems in various places in the past have been uneven, resulting in different collection situations in various places. However, in order to ensure that the people do not increase the burden and the tax revenue is not affected, the Ministry of Finance is now trying to make it balance, so as to ensure that the three parties of officials, merchants, and people are not affected. At present, the Liangzhe salt area has been balanced and there is no problem. However, the Lianghuai prison area still needs to be found a way, and it is hoped that it will be implemented as soon as possible and completely resolved by the Economic Commission.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Cultivating Wasteland in the Lianghuai Salt Area <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>

<p>The cultivation of wasteland in the Lianghuai salt area has been transferred to the National Economic Committee. It is learned that the area of wasteland in the Lianghuai salt area of the association reaches more than 13 million mu, so it is decided to engage in cultivation according to the salt cultivation plan. It has been decided to organize an inspection team in the Lianghuai salt area to inspect various salt areas for the preparation of cultivation. The candidates for the team members will be experts selected by the association. At that time, the General Office of the Salt Affairs Audit will also send personnel to participate and assist. It is now in preparation and can be dispatched around March.

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Presented to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3 id="e161">Please Reduce or Exempt Transshipment Shoe Tax <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, "It is presented for presentation, and on the 7th of this month, according to the letter from the Shoe Industry Association, it is stated that the members of the association, Yu Kang, Jiuda, Daqingxiang, Yongyuxiang, Sanjing, Datong, and other 32 shoe companies, stated that the raw materials for shoemaking, no matter what, even a nail or a thread, have already paid heavy taxes, and even paid several times the tax, such as wholesale, must pay business tax, and for the export of shoes, the customs must still levy taxes, and its tax rate is not constant, such as the same goods, the last time each pair paid a tax of one dime, this time it must pay a tax of one dime and two cents, or one dime and six cents, all of which are freely estimated by the customs surveyors. The members are engaged in the shoe business, in addition to sales in this port, also selling to guest gangs. Due to the influence of customs duties, they are declining day by day, and they are almost extinct. Not only is it difficult for members to maintain their business and livelihood, but also the increase in unemployment of workers and the livelihood is worrying. However, shoes are daily necessities, which people need, not consumable luxury goods that can be compared. And its raw materials have already paid taxes, and if you want to pay taxes again, it is obvious that you have to pay several times. Therefore, I especially present to your association, requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Ministry of Industry and Finance, to cancel the repeated customs duties on the shoe industry, directly protect the shoemakers, and indirectly reduce the number of unemployed workers, etc., to the association. It is found that the export of shoes has plummeted recently, which has an impact on customs duties. There is no influence. The government has long had an order to abolish the repeated customs duties. I hereby present the situation to you, hoping that you will review and transfer it to the Ministry of Industry and Finance to approve the cancellation of this repeated customs duty, in order to show compassion and maintain domestic products, which is really convenient for the public.", etc., to the association. It is found that the nature of the domestic transshipment customs duties is similar to that of transit taxes. In principle, it should be abolished. Now, even if it is retained due to the shortage of public funds, the tax items should be simple and the tax rate should be lightened. This is a fixed method. Moreover, the raw materials for shoemaking, from the silk and呢of the shoe surface to the leather of the sole, and its nail thread, are all subject to customs duties, so although the goods are levied, the tax burden is already high. Shoe merchants process and配制, which is equal to the level of ready-made clothes, and the profit is small. Now, if you re-evaluate and tax at the time of transshipment, it is difficult to make a profit, and the sales will be extinct. According to the previous letter, it is reasonable to present it to your ministry, and I hope that you will approve the temporary reduction or exemption of the transshipment shoe tax in order to relieve business difficulties. If it is hampered by the general case, or the ad valorem tax will be changed to a specific tax, and the regulations will be reduced lightly, so that you can get a little profit and maintain客销, and you will be very grateful.", and presented it to the Ministry of Finance.</p>

With utmost sincerity, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, kowtows, with seal.</p>
<p>The Impact of Diesel Tax Increase</p>
<h3 id="e164">Inland Diesel Engine Power Plants Will Be Trapped in Desperation <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Electric Power Association Has Appealed to the Government</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance began collecting a diesel tariff of 50 yuan per ton on February 1, domestic industrial circles, as well as the electric light and shipping industries, upon hearing this news, were greatly alarmed, as diesel is a necessary fuel for diesel engines, and its selling price is more than 70 yuan per ton. Now, a sudden 70% tariff is levied. The Zhejiang Private Electric Power Industry Federation, located at No. 212 Nanjing Road in this city, finds that electric light companies in Zhejiang Province that use diesel engines to generate electricity account for 89%. Its members require more than 6,000 tons of diesel per year. If the current oil price is maintained, the annual loss will reach more than 300,000 yuan. At this time of popular poverty and commercial difficulties, business is even more difficult, and they will all be forced to shut down. After accepting the requests for relief from representatives of various member companies, the association deeply understands that the electrical industry is closely related to social peace and factory production. Therefore, it has explained the commercial difficulties in detail and submitted requests to the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Construction Committee, and other agencies, requesting that they withdraw the order and preserve a lifeline for industry. At the same time, the Chairman of the Association, Mr. Li Yanshi, went to Beijing to petition various agencies. It is also heard that various industrial factories in this city are also finding the diesel tax extraordinarily heavy, enough to deliver a death blow. They are appealing to the government separately, striving for a united effort.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association, due to the fact that there were more than 500 thatched sheds on the barren land of the Yuyuan Road branch of the Shanghai Pudong Nanxiazhe Road Nursing Home, suddenly caught fire at around 11:00 p.m. on the 3rd.

<p>Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association</p>
<h3 id="e168">Telegraphed Zhejiang Province to Rescue Xu Guangsheng <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Death for Selling Opium</p>
<p>Xin Xin News reports: The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association, yesterday, regarding the case of Xu Guangsheng being sentenced to death by the Yin County Court for selling opium, and based on the application for redress from Xu's mother-in-law, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the High Court, stating: "To the respected Zhejiang Provincial Government and High Court of Hangzhou, according to the brief statement of fellow villager Chen Li: 'I am over sixty years old, without children or nephews, few brothers, lonely and helpless, and rely on my son-in-law Xu Guangsheng for a living. On October 24th of last year, Guangsheng was entrusted to carry a small amount of opium from Shanghai to Ningbo. Just as he was about to deliver it, he was suddenly discovered by the Yin County Local Court."</p>
<h3 id="e169">Personnel Dispatched to Investigate <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>"Subsequently, on January 31st of this year, the Yin County Local Court deemed him to be selling opium and sentenced him to death. Guangsheng was ignorant of the law and was fooled by others, which is deserving of punishment. However, to impose the death penalty is inevitably too harsh. The Yin County Local Court cited the Zhejiang Province Regulations for the Elimination of Narcotics. According to Article 5 of the regulations: 'Those who sell or intend to sell and possess or transport opium, red pills, or other narcotics shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment of more than ten years. Those whose circumstances are minor shall still be punished in accordance with the Opium Suppression Law.' According to the above regulations, those who are sentenced to death must be in extremely serious circumstances, such that the death penalty is necessary to serve as a warning. If it is due to temporary ignorance or forced by livelihood, then the circumstances are understandable and the situation is pitiful. The responsible authorities may also consider the circumstances and change the sentence to life imprisonment or imprisonment of more than twenty years. Now, Guangsheng rashly carried opium for others due to ignorance of the seriousness of the law, which is not comparable to selling for profit. Even if we take selling as the crime, the circumstances are still minor and should not be"</p>
<h3 id="e170">Punished with the Death Penalty <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>"The Yin County Local Court did not consider the severity of the circumstances and hastily made a final judgment, causing Guangsheng to die unjustly. This is the first point. Moreover, Gong Jinsheng, who was arrested in the same case, had the same criminal circumstances as Guangsheng, but the Yin County Local Court sentenced him to ten years in prison, with different punishments for the same crime. This is the second point. Article 6 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China stipulates that citizens of the Republic of China are equal under the law regardless of gender, race, religion, or class."</p>
<h3 id="e171">Absolutely Equal <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>"The Regulations for the Elimination of Narcotics are a separate law of Zhejiang Province. The rest of the Republic of China, except for Zhejiang, all use the Opium Suppression Law. The penalty for selling opium under the Opium Suppression Law is only imprisonment of one to five years. Under the jurisdiction of the same government, the punishment for the same criminal act is completely different, which violates the provisions of the Provisional Constitution and the principle of the balance of law. This is the third point. Now, the son-in-law, Guangsheng, has"</p>
<h3 id="e172">Violated the Criminal Law <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>"Due to ignorance of the law, and the judges who hold the power of life and death did not consider whether the regulations were lawful or whether Guangsheng's actions were serious, and misused the severe law on a provision that had no right of appeal, resulting in an injustice that cannot be appealed. We ask that the case be transferred for re-examination and rectification, and that an appropriate sentence be imposed to avoid excessive punishment, which is truly a matter of public concern. Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association, Chairman Yu Hede, respectfully."</p>

After much expectation, those who cannot operate have been waiting for three months, and the rickshaw operators are extremely distressed. Several members of their families are sitting and waiting for death, and the tragic situation is unbearable to witness. The rickshaw operators, because the donation period for March permits has passed, but the issue remains unresolved, specially gathered more than 100 unlicensed rickshaw operators at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Nanshi branch of the Rickshaw Industry Association on Puyudong Road to hold a petition. The chairman of the association, Qiu Chunshan, standing committee member Song Xikun, and supervising committee member Yu Dajin received them. Petition representatives Lu Xiushan and Li Bingyi and others stated the difficult situation of the rickshaw operators and requested the association's assistance. Qiu Chunshan and others then comforted them separately, saying that the association is preparing for the final solution and will do its best to help until the goal is achieved. Please wait patiently for the solution. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed at 4:00 p.m.</p>

<p>In January, there were 114 industrial and occupational accidents in the Public Concession, injuring 116 people, of whom four died as a result. Thirty people were injured by rotating parts, and four were injured by rotating belts and pulleys. Therefore, it is necessary to install protective devices outside the machinery. There were 12 textile industry accidents, but none were injured by electricity, which may be due to the cold and dryness, which reduces the possibility. In addition, 13 people were injured in construction projects, of which seven fell. There were 16 transportation industry accidents, mostly involving workers on the docks. There were 66 other accidents, the cause of which was not clear.</p>

<p>The Public Safety Committee of the Municipal Council previously received complaints that large parades in the concession obstructed traffic. The Chief of Police was immediately ordered to discuss solutions. Recently, the Chief of Police submitted a report advocating that the affairs of applying for permits for such parades be transferred from the salary section to the vehicle section, and that the regulations be written in detail in Chinese and English on the permits to restrict them. As for the maximum number of participants in the parade, the committee, after discussion, believed that it should be limited to 300 people. In special circumstances, the Chief of Police may decide on it. Article 62 of the traffic regulations was also proposed to be amended by the Director-General to stipulate that no person may gather, lead, or participate in any parades or gatherings such as weddings or funerals on the road without first obtaining a permit from the Police Department. The Board of Directors raised the case on the 7th of this month and resolved to proceed with it.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Instructs Mine Operators</p>
<h3 id="e182">Mine Maps Must Not Use Glossy Paper <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Starting from March 1, those who fail to comply with the Ministry's order will be rejected. The Ministry of Industry instructed the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "It is clearly stipulated in Article 28 of the Implementation Rules of the Mining Law that glossy paper must not be used to make mine area maps, and that orders must not be arbitrarily established, resulting in confusion. However, recently, it has been found that the mine area maps of various provincial and municipal officials and merchants mostly use glossy glass paper for drawing. Not only are the official seals and private seals blurred over time, making them impossible to identify, but also the ink marks on the maps are easily wiped and changed. It is essential to strictly prohibit it in order to enforce the law and prevent abuses. The competent authorities of each province and city should strictly order all mine operators not to use this glossy paper for drawing mine maps in the future, otherwise, they will be rejected. This order will be implemented from March 1. In addition to separate orders, the bureau is ordered to transfer it to all mine operators for compliance. Sincerely,"</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan again yesterday regarding the inspection of pickled meat and ham entering the market, requesting its cancellation. The original text reads: "The Nanshi Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Association submitted a letter on January 8 this year, stating that it had set up its own inspection for eight months and had not found any goods that did not meet health standards. Many merchants from the north and south have found the inspection procedures cumbersome and have been reluctant to come to Shanghai, causing business to decline drastically and making it difficult to maintain. We strongly request the cancellation of the meat inspection entering the city.' It has been submitted to your honorable court for ordering cancellation according to the law in No. 396, but no order has been received so far. The two industry associations have written to reiterate the previous situation, stating that our industry requests the cancellation of the pickled meat and ham inspection facilities in this city, and all reasons have been clearly stated in the previous submission, but we have been waiting until now without receiving any instructions, so we request that you urge for it as soon as possible. Based on this, it is reasonable to continue to telegraph the presentation, requesting that your honorable court investigate and approve, order the city to cancel the two inspections as soon as possible in accordance with the law, in order to alleviate commercial difficulties and comply with the legal system, and hope to show compliance as soon as possible, which is truly convenient for the public. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows with yang seal."</p>

<p>Selecting Basic Weaving Households and Establishing Reward and Punishment Measures</p>
<p>Since its expansion and reorganization last month, the Chinese Domestic Cotton Cloth Market on Guizhou Road in Shanghai has seen a surge in the number of weaving households sending in their cloth.

It is also reported that reward and punishment measures have been established to provide encouragement.

<p>Held at the National Hotel in the French Concession starting yesterday</p>
<p>Architect Fan Wenzhao and American architect Lin Peng, recognizing that Spanish-style residences are well-integrated with Chinese living habits and possess the advantages of science and art, and thus have the necessity for promotion, specially consulted Chinese and Western architectural regulations, observed the needs of modern trends, and drafted dozens of the latest Spanish-style residential design plans. Starting yesterday, they are being publicly exhibited for a week at the National Hotel in the French Concession to benefit the contemporary world. Last night, tea and refreshments were provided to the Chinese and Western press in Shanghai, with dozens of reporters from the Continental Daily, China Times, Ta Mei Evening News, North China Daily News, and others in attendance. According to architect Fan, he has been serving in architecture for many years, and he deeply knows the importance of our daily residences, and that improvement without science and art is fruitless. Recognizing that modern Spanish architecture, with its appearance, color, and structure, has much in common with Chinese architecture, we should adopt its values to evoke artistic concepts in our daily residences. Therefore, he is collaborating with architect Lin Peng, who has studied Spanish architecture in the United States for many years, to hold the Spanish exhibition for promotion.</p>
<p>Tong Teh Hospital</p>
<h3 id="e188">Request for Compensation for Self-Built Wards <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Tong Teh Hospital and its land at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Dagu Road were originally donated by Huang Cuojiu. Therefore, Tong Teh built operating rooms, clinics, and other facilities on this land, at a cost of about 50,000 yuan. These funds were entirely raised through donations from various sectors. After Huang's death, due to Huang's debt entanglements, the original agreement for the Tong Teh land was overturned and put up for public auction. Tong Teh believes that the repossession of the land has already caused setbacks in public charity and the progress of the highest academic institution, and that being auctioned would lead to complete destruction. Therefore, it has petitioned the court to require the beneficiary to compensate Tong Teh for all the buildings and improvements, so that there can be compensation when building the new school building. Therefore, a certain prominent school director is actively mediating, hoping to achieve the goal.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Music</p>
<h3 id="e190">To Be Broadcast by Radio <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Committee has recommended to the board of directors that a dedicated telephone line be installed from the music team's practice room to connect to radio station XQHA, with a quarterly telephone fee of one hundred taels, to be paid for two quarters in advance. The team's music will be broadcast at least twice a week to generate public interest. As for the broadcast time, the music team leader suggests playing symphonic music every Wednesday afternoon from 9:15 PM to 10:30 PM, and more popular music every Friday afternoon from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM. This proposal was submitted to the board of directors on the 7th and has been approved for implementation. Furthermore, the Women's Public Association suggested that the music be broadcast to schoolchildren in schools. Because the municipal schools would have to purchase radios for this purpose, the Music Committee requested that this matter be transferred to the Education Committee for discussion. If approved, the music team leader will then liaise with the Education Department in detail. This proposal was also approved by the board of directors.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Dismissed Aide-de-Camp Commits Many Evils <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Using Military Uniform as Amulet and Using Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Recently Stealing to Make a Living, Committing Crimes Repeatedly</p>
<p>There is a thief nicknamed "Little Shandong" who has been specializing in stealing items from people's homes in the Putianni Ferry area. He aims to steal anything, including clocks, kerosene stoves, washbasins, foot tubs, stools, chairs, and clothes. His background is that he was an aide-de-camp in a certain former military department, but was dismissed for some reason. He once bought counterfeit money in Shanghai and cashed it in the Jiangbei area. Every time he went, he would return to Shanghai with hundreds of dollars in cash and spend it recklessly. When the money ran out, he would go to Jiangbei again to use his old tricks. However, he deceived Jiangbei merchants several times, and because he was wearing a single uniform, the victims did not dare to argue with him. Later, he was exposed by the local authorities, and the investigation became tighter, so he dared not go there again. However, he stayed in Pudong, unable to make a living, and relied on stealing to make a living. His stealing method is also different from others. During the day, when passing by people's houses, he would enter the house and steal anything at will if he saw that no one was inside. After stealing, he would take the stolen goods to various alleys and sell them at extremely low prices. For example, a self-ringing clock would only be sold for one yuan or a few dimes, a kerosene stove would only be sold for seventy or eighty cents, and so on. Poor people generally bought them cheaply. Seeing that there was a way out, Little Shandong stole more frequently. In the past year or two, countless people have been robbed. Even the day before yesterday, seven families went to the Third District to report losses. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the bandit was suddenly arrested by Detective Li and others from the Third District. In half a day in the afternoon, more than ten families' stolen goods had been recovered. He is currently still being held in the district to continue recovering stolen goods, and will be handed over to the authorities later.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sentenced for Setting Up Illegal Flower Gambling Listening Post <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Wu Bingzhou, a Ningbo native, 33 years old, residing at No. 6, Lane 75, Aolihe Road, French Concession, secretly set up an illegal flower gambling listening post at home to collect gambling funds and send them to a large gambling den in Zhabei. Detectives from the French Concession's gambling arrest team found out and rushed to arrest Wu on the afternoon of the 4th, seizing flower gambling slips, gambling fund ledgers, and other items. He was sent to the Second Special District Court, where the police lawyer filed a lawsuit according to law. Wu admitted in the police station that he had only set up the listening post for two days, collecting gambling funds of fifteen to twenty yuan each day and sending them to the Dafu factory opened by Shen Jiafu, Jie Fu, on Changan Road in Zhabei. Unexpectedly, in court, he overturned his previous confession and completely denied it. He was ordered to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing with witnesses. Yesterday, Judge Qiu continued the hearing in Criminal Court Eight. According to the testimony of the landlady, Mrs. Hu, the testimony was very vague, while Wu still insisted on his previous court confession. The court reviewed the confession and found that the evidence of the defendant setting up an illegal listening post was solid, so he was immediately sentenced to one month of imprisonment and a fine of twenty yuan, and the seized evidence was confiscated. The defendant, upon hearing the verdict, declared that he did not accept it and requested an appeal. The court granted it. During the appeal period, he was ordered to provide a surety to be available for summons at any time pending instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Child Detention Centers in the North China War Zone <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Certain Traitorous Countries Ruining Our Country's Children</p>
<p>Currently Engaged in Investigation and Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association has recently received reports from various sources stating that although various agencies have provided relief to various parts of North China after last year's war, the area is still scarred, and the survivors are living in dire straits, lacking food and clothing. Some are even selling their daughters and children to feed themselves. Anyone with a conscience should take steps to rescue them and fulfill the obligation of human mutual assistance. However, it is known that certain countries, disregarding conscience and abandoning humanity, are seizing the opportunity to establish child detention centers under the guise of relief and education at the price of ten or eight yuan, luring poor people to bring their children and daughters into their trap, greedy for immediate petty gains and forgetting the gathering of flesh and blood. Moreover, after the children are detained, the excellent ones are subjected to the destruction of their intelligence, the mediocre ones are subjected to the obstruction of their development, and even, depending on the circumstances, they are arbitrarily slaughtered. Upon hearing this, the association could not help but bristle with anger. Therefore, at the recent meeting of officers, it decided on three measures as relief steps: 1. Communicate and investigate; 2. Publicize the facts; 3. Provide on-site relief. It is reported that the association has already sent out more than a dozen postal and telegraphic messages to solicit information from enthusiastic individuals and organizations in various counties that assisted the association in the North China war zone last year, such as Miyun, Zunhua, Luodong, Changli, Pingtao, Xinglong, Lengkou, Qian'an, etc., to immediately investigate the truth on the ground and report the facts as the basis for the second and third steps of the work.</p>

<p>After the Puan ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was robbed, several weeks have passed, but the case has not yet been solved, and the kidnapped hostages are also missing. The company is now actively pursuing the pirates, rescuing the hostages, and implementing anti-theft measures on each sea vessel. The details are described separately as follows:</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has held several meetings regarding the robbery of the Puan ship, deciding to proceed with the arrest of the thieves and ensure that they are severely punished. Therefore, on the one hand, a large reward was offered to purchase clues to arrest the bandits, and on the other hand, the company specially dispatched Commissioner Sun to Guangdong, carrying the company's reward notices to Guangdong to discuss with the Guangdong provincial authorities practical measures to pursue and arrest the pirates. Because the bandits have entered Guangdong territory, the cooperation of the Guangdong military and police is necessary to solve the case. The most important thing is to rescue the nine kidnapped passengers. The Guangdong authorities have complied with the request of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and dispatched naval and land forces to encircle and suppress the pirates. It is expected that the case will be solved and the hostages will be rescued soon.</p>

<p>The wireless telegraphs on each ship are always located on the highest floor, which is easily trapped by bandits. Now the Ship Affairs Department has drafted an opinion to move the telegraph rooms on each ship to other locations. On the one hand, they are contacting Mr. Xu Zufan of the Security Wireless Telegraph Company, and it has been decided to install the newly invented alarm motor. Once activated, it can generate electricity freely without human power, emitting a signal every two or three minutes. Military vessels within a radius of one hundred nautical miles can receive it and come to the rescue immediately. The company has decided to uniformly add this motor to each sea vessel.</p>

<p>The escort police on each ship have now been uniformly increased. The original four people have been increased to six people, and Puan has even used twelve people. The number of police has also increased for ships with more passenger seats. Inspectors are assigned to cargo ships. The Fairwind has also discussed adding iron railings. As for checking passengers and obtaining guarantees from passengers introduced by various inns and ticket offices, the Taikoo Company has already implemented it. In order to be cautious about the safety of future voyages and passengers, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will also uniformly follow this procedure to prevent bandits from mixing in.</p>

<p>Puan and English Ship Collision Case</p>
<h3 id="e202">Decided to Submit to Public Arbitration <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Representatives from Both Sides Inspected the Two Ships and Appointed Experts to Arbitrate Responsibility for the Accident</p>
<p>The Puan ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Philoctetes of the British Merchant Blue Funnel Line collided, causing significant losses to both sides. Yesterday, each side sent representatives to inspect the ships, and then scheduled public arbitration. The following is a continuation of the news:</p>
<h3 id="e203">Both Parties Inspect the Ships <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>After the collision between the Puan ship and the Philoctetes, the first important issue was the question of responsibility for the accident. What is right and wrong, and the extent of the damage to both sides, should be publicly verified before repairs can be carried out to avoid further delays. Therefore, yesterday morning, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, together with the Blue Funnel Line, and notified the relevant insurance companies, each sent representatives. The representatives from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were Zhao Yuntai and Zhou Houkun, the director and deputy director of the Ship Affairs Department, and engineer Zhao Taibao, the representative of the insurance company. The representatives from the British Merchant side were the manager of the Blue Funnel Line and the representative of the insurance company. In total, there were more than ten people from both sides. Starting at 9:00 AM, they went to Pudong together to publicly inspect the damage to the two ships, which lasted for five hours.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Ascertaining the Damage <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The representatives of both parties first went to the Blue Funnel Wharf to inspect the British ship Philoctetes. The iron plates on the outer hull of the collision site were all dented. Although the hull was injured, it was not yet broken. After the inspection representatives ascertained the damage, they questioned the shipowners about the incident at that time. Everyone took notes when the shipowners reported. Next, they went to the Chinese Wharf to inspect the Puan ship. They first looked at the damaged part of the bow and then questioned the shipowner, Rex, about the collision, which was very detailed and took a long time. What Rex said was also recorded. After the inspection of the two ships was completed, the representatives returned to Shanghai in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Repairing First <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The first step of joint inspection has been completed, and the two ships will first enter the dock for repairs to avoid further delays and greater losses to the shipping schedule. Because the cost of each ocean ship, including fuel, is at least seven or eight hundred yuan per day, the damage to the bow of the Puan ship is very serious, and the keel will also be replaced, which will cost a lot. Now the company will have the ship repaired, and the shipyards in Shanghai will submit their bills to the company, and the one with the lowest price and meeting the needs will be selected for repair. Which factory to enter must be decided tomorrow. The Blue Funnel Line's ship will also be repaired in the dock by the company itself, and is currently in contact with various shipyards. The repair of the Puan ship this time will take at least two weeks to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Responsibility Submitted to Public Arbitration <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>It is still difficult to determine the responsibility for the collision between the two ships. Yesterday, the directors of the two ships each had their own arguments. Therefore, it was jointly decided that the two ship companies and the insurance company would jointly appoint several Western members of the ship arbitration committee to form an arbitration office to investigate the case. The reporter also asked Mr. Zhao Yuntai, the director of the Ship Affairs Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who said that the arbitrators have not yet been appointed, but it is likely that the two parties will jointly decide to appoint them tomorrow (the 10th). There are many people in Shanghai who specialize in arbitration, but this case will absolutely not be transferred to the Collision Committee of the Navigation Administration Bureau for handling because the other party is a British ship, which our Navigation Administration Bureau cannot handle, and the Blue Funnel Line also does not agree to be dealt with by the Navigation Administration Bureau.</p>
<p>Prosperity in the South City</p>
<h3 id="e207">Land Prices Soar in the West Gate Area <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Since the municipal authorities have reorganized the main roads in the Nanshi area of Shanghai, the market has become increasingly prosperous. It is reported that the number of construction projects in Nanshi last year was actually more than in previous years. The area around the east and west gates is particularly lively. Land prices in this area have now risen to nearly 100,000. Traffic at the West Gate is now even more developed. Since the opening of Heping Road, and the extension of the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Tram line to Nanyang Bridge, the daily traffic of cars and horses passing through the area is very complicated. Therefore, the municipal authorities believe that it is necessary to install traffic lights. Construction has been underway since last year for nearly two months and will be completed soon. The municipal authorities are now drafting new traffic rules and will start applying them next month.</p>
<p>Thugs Extort Female Kidnappers</p>
<h3 id="e208">Two Children Rescued <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Thugs are Guilty, Kidnappers Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Geng Zhangshi, a female kidnapper from Anhui, 41 years old, residing at No. 105 Aixuejin Road, Public Concession, and Zhang Fangshi from Jiangbei, 33 years old, residing at an unknown number on Baoyuan Road, Chinese Concession, took an unnamed four-year-old boy who spoke the local dialect and a six-year-old boy named Lian Xiao who spoke the Tongzhou and northern Anhui dialect to the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession on the afternoon of the 7th. They boarded the Tonghua ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Shantou route, intending to sell them in Shantou. After the two women took the children off the ship, they happened to meet detectives from the Women and Children Relief Association searching the ship for kidnappers abducting children for export. The two women, feeling guilty, feared being discovered, so they took the children ashore together to temporarily avoid being caught. After the detectives finished searching, they took the children back on the ship. During this process of going ashore and boarding the ship, five or six thugs on the dock saw them. Knowing that the two women were abducting children for export and sale, they followed them ashore and extorted them, demanding fifty dollars. The thugs were also afraid of being discovered by passengers on the ship and people on the dock, so they took the two women and the two children ashore together to the Taixing Hotel on Minquan Road outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, opened room 31, and negotiated inside, using soft deception and intimidation. In the end, because the two women had no remaining funds besides the travel expenses they needed, they could not satisfy the thugs' greed, resulting in no results. In the evening, the thugs ordered Li Zhongting (24 years old, residing in Xinkang Lane, Minquan Road), a Ningbo native and companion, to guard the two women and children in the hotel, while they sneaked out to find other ways to achieve their desires. They informed Chinese Constable No. 149 of the French Police Station on duty on the Bund, hoping to find a way. The constable, believing that the female kidnappers taking children abroad for sale involved criminal law, pretended to cooperate with the thugs and told them to return to the hotel and wait, while secretly reporting to the Xiaodongmen Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives Liu Kunbao and Hu Fusheng to rush to room 31 of the Taixing Hotel, arrested the two female kidnappers and the guarding thug Li Zhongting, and took them and the two children to the police station. Later, the detectives went to arrest the other thugs who were extorting them, but they had all fled. After reporting back to the police chief, Geng Zhangshi was interrogated and admitted to buying the four-year-old boy for forty yuan and taking him to Shantou for sale. Zhang Fangshi claimed that the six-year-old boy, Lian Xiao, was her own son and denied the abduction, but her behavior was inconsistent. Li Zhongting confessed that his accomplices planned to extort the two women. The police chief ordered them to be detained together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court One of the Second Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Fangguang interrogated them. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, saying that the defendants were involved in an extortion case, and the police station needed to conduct a detailed investigation and arrest the accomplices who were still at large, requesting a rescheduled hearing. The patrolman then reported the process of arresting the defendants, and the two abducted children were brought to the court. The court asked the children about the abduction, but because they were young, their answers were irrelevant. The judge briefly interrogated the three defendants and ordered them to be detained separately pending further investigation and interrogation at a later date.</p>
<p>More Than 130,000 Yuan Fraud Case</p>
<h3 id="e209">Six Defendants in the Sino-Russian Case <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Court Continued Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Englishman Mark Refused to Testify</p>
<p>The case of the alleged swindling of over 130,000 yuan from the Mercantile Bank was continued for interrogation yesterday afternoon by Judge Qian Hongye of the First Special District Court. In addition to the four previously apprehended defendants of Chinese and Russian nationality, the severed-finger Russian Sarnik, who had been transferred from Tianjin to Shanghai, was also brought to the court to face interrogation together. Yang Cailin, the owner of the Lianyi Printing House who printed the forged checks, was also brought to the court by his defense lawyer Fan Gang after surrendering himself to the police. Thus, the number of defendants increased from four to six. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the circumstances of the arrest of the two newly added defendants. He then stated that a witness, a Russian named Messel, had reported to the police that the account in the name of Sukolov of the Jiangzhe Commercial and Savings Bank was opened on his behalf at the request of the first defendant. However, since this witness was not present, the statement written by Messel in the police station, and</p>
<h3 id="e210">Accounting for the Use of the Embezzled Money <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>A note explaining the style of the forged check were presented to the court together. The court immediately questioned the first defendant, Kesaifu Ai'ane, regarding the points stated by Lawyer Ru. However, he only admitted that the account statement was typed by the English manager of the Puyang firm, Mark, using a typewriter, and brought back by him from Puyang. As for Messel opening an account at the Jiangzhe Bank, he denied that he had asked him to do so. The court then questioned the fifth defendant, Sarnik, who testified that he used to work as a broker under Mark's management and that Mark had ordered him to find a Japanese to make the copper plate, but did not specify the purpose at the time, and that</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Original Only Had Patterns <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>And no words, so I didn't know it was a check. Later, I went to Tianjin, so Kasen took over the copper plate making, retrieval, and printing. I didn't get any money. Later, Kasen also went to Tianjin, and he said that he got 8,000 yuan, etc. The court then summoned the Englishman Mark for questioning, but Mr. Mark refused to testify, saying that he was also being prosecuted in the British Concession and could only speak after the British Concession made a judgment. The court did not ask any further questions but turned to Kesaifu Ai'ane regarding the third defendant, Ximala Sikai, who was regarded as an adopted son, and should clarify</p>
<h3 id="e212">What Kind of Adoption Relationship <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The defendant did not want to announce this point, only saying that they had lived together for nine years. This time, when making fake checks, he only sent him to the printing house once with Kasen. After the deception was successful, he was not given any share because the third defendant's living expenses were always provided by me, so there was no need to give him anything else. Then the second defendant, Wang Chungang, was questioned about the process of stealing the old checks of the British American Tobacco Company kept by the Mercantile Bank. According to Wang's confession, he first met Ximala Sikai through Xie Pingfeng, and then met his father, Kesaifu Ai'ane. One day I went to his house, and Mr. Ke asked me about the content of the Mercantile Bank where I worked. He said that he would be a shareholder in the business and asked me to take an old check from the bank so that he could print it according to the format. Therefore, I</p>
<h3 id="e213">Consulted with the Local Clerk in the Bank <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Meng Zhang, who sealed the old check in an envelope and handed it to me in the toilet. I immediately gave it to the first defendant. He rewarded the local clerk with 30 yuan and gave me radios and other things. However, he said at the time that he had made a profit from making gold, so he rewarded me. Later, he gave me another 4,500 yuan. The court immediately questioned the first defendant about Wang's confession for confrontation. The defendant claimed that Mark needed the old checks, so I asked Wang to find them for me. Although I didn't tell him the purpose at first, Wang knew it later. Therefore, when distributing the spoils,</p>
<h3 id="e214">It Was Not Necessary to Explain the Origin <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>I only dealt with Wang, and no local clerk participated. According to Ximala Sikai's confession in Chinese, the first defendant conspired with the others to commit fraud, but he did not know anything about it, although he knew a little but not in detail. When more than 130,000 yuan was defrauded, the first defendant gave him a total of 300 yuan. When questioned about the fourth defendant, Xie Pingfeng, he tried to evade and shirk responsibility in every way. However, he had already confessed in detail to the whole story of forging false tickets in the police station. Now, wanting to change his confession, he claimed that he had not slept all night when he confessed in the police station and was not clear-headed, and his words were mostly untrue. Finally, according to the sixth defendant, Yang Cailin, he was introduced to print by Xie, and the copper mold was also brought by Xie, etc. Judge Qian had questioned to this point, and since it was getting late, he ordered Ximala Sikai to pay 300 yuan bail, and the other five defendants were all returned to custody, and the hearing was adjourned to another day.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Xinjiang Tian Comprador</p>

<p>Relatives Discovered His Suicide Note After He Boarded the Ship</p>
<p>Fearing Suicide En Route, They Entrusted the Comprador to Rescue Him</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, on the China Merchants Bureau's Ningbo-bound Xinjiang Mo Lun, a man boarded the ship in cabin number sixteen, claiming to be Wang Xiuting, returning to his ancestral home in Ningbo. Unexpectedly, at about 9:40 PM that night, the coastal radio station of the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station on Minguo Road suddenly received a telegram from someone claiming to be a relative of Wang Xiuting, asking the Xinjiang Tian comprador to supervise Wang Xiuting in cabin number sixteen and send him back to Shanghai on the same ship. When asked about the reason for the telegram, it was said that after Wang Xiuting boarded the ship, they discovered a suicide note stating that he was under environmental pressure and feared that he would commit suicide by jumping into the sea before arriving in Ningbo. Therefore, they telegraphed the ship for assistance.</p>

<p>The Captured Bandit's Name is Zhao Yunzong</p>
<p>Hua Deputy Detective Feng Baishun and Detective Cui Chengke of the Chengdu Road Police Station received a report from an informant yesterday that there were many bandits planning to rob a certain actress's house in an alley behind the Pingmin Hospital on Chongqing Road that evening. Deputy Detective Feng immediately led Detectives Cui Chengke, Bao Tan Yang Xinzheng, Zhang Yutian, and Western detectives to the vicinity at around 7:00 PM and waited separately. At around 10:00 PM, they saw three people looking flustered, coming from the south. The detectives immediately stepped forward to intercept them. Unexpectedly, one of them drew a gun and resisted arrest. The detectives also immediately drew their guns and returned fire, killing one bandit on the spot and capturing one. It has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the captured bandit's name is Zhao Yunzong, 27 years old, from Ningbo. He was immediately taken back to the police station and detained. The dead bandit's name is Tang Er, 22 years old, from Tongzhou. The mountain detectives carried the body to the Filan Road autopsy center. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Zhao Yunzong to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, requesting detention. The court approved it. Then the procuratorate appointed Prosecutor Diao Chengtang to accompany forensic doctor Zhang Yan and recorder Wang Zuji to the center to examine the body. Hua Detective Feng Baishun reported the situation at the time and presented the seized pistol and five bullets. After investigation, Zhao Yunzong confessed that the incident was initiated by a Wang surnamed person, nicknamed Da Ningbo. A friend knew that the actress's family had two or three thousand yuan in cash. Da Ningbo was sick, so he ordered me to rob her. The pistol was borrowed by me from a certain place in the Taosha Chang, etc. After obtaining the confession, Mr. Diao ordered that the autopsy revealed that the male thief Tang Er died of a gunshot wound to the head during his lifetime. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection. It was later reported that there was no stripping of women's clothing, etc. The report may have been a misunderstanding based on rumors. It also stated that the dead bandit had committed several road robberies in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Transport Personnel Unauthorized Release of Suspects</p>
<h3 id="e217">Concurrently Sent to the Garrison Headquarters for Punishment <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Gancheng, director of the Shanghai Reception Office of the Seventh Branch of the Second Recruitment Office of the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, previously detained a person impersonating a military criminal, Wang Jinlin from Changzhou, in Zhabei, and found a letter of appointment as a member of the preparatory committee of the China Relief Front Line Wounded and Disabled Rehabilitation Hospital. After questioning him once, he sent the transport personnel of the office, Yu Zeqing from Hubei, to escort the principal offender to the Zhenjiang New Recruit Recruitment Headquarters for verification. Upon arriving in Zhenjiang, they first went to a restaurant to eat. Unexpectedly, Yu hinted to Wang that he could be released, but he needed some activity fees. Wang naturally expressed his acceptance. However, because Zhenjiang was an unfamiliar place, he had no way to raise the money and needed to return to Shanghai to raise it. Yu agreed, and the two secretly returned to Shanghai together. On the afternoon of the 31st of last month, they went to the Yuchun Chi Bathhouse on Fuzhou Road to negotiate. Yu demanded a bribe of 70 yuan. Unexpectedly, Wang went back on his word and suddenly regretted it, resulting in a dispute. They argued endlessly, and the patrolmen, hearing the alarm, detained Yu and Wang together and sent them to the General Patrol House for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Inspector Xu Pengfei submitted an official document requesting transfer for punishment. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan then rose and stated that he did not object to the transfer. Judge Qian Hongye ordered that Yu Zeqing and Wang Jinlin be handed over to the personnel from the Garrison Headquarters to be taken back for trial. The police station chief was accused</p>

<p>Qin Jingtao, Lu Jingqin, and other merchants and residents from Xinxie and other areas in northwestern Shanghai jointly filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Liu Lun, the chief of the Sixth District First Branch of the town's Public Security Bureau, of colluding with local bullies like Cheng Dexiu, dereliction of duty, harming the people, harboring gambling dens, and collecting illegal fees. After receiving the complaint, the court, yesterday afternoon, on the order of Prosecutor Wu Deying, summoned the plaintiffs Qin Jingtao (owner of Da Shun Nanhua Store in Beixinjing Town), Lu Jingqin (owner of Lu Yuan Sheng Jing Huo Store in Beixinjing), Yao Youliang (farmer from Yaos family in Beixinjing Northwest), and witnesses Li Yongsheng (owner of Li Mao Tai Cheng Huo and Fresh Meat Store in Beixinjing Town), Gu Yutao (owner of Coffin Shop in Xichenjiaqiao, Beixinjing), Zhang Quan (engineer of Siemens Foreign Company on Jiangxi Road, residing near Beixinjing), Zhu Adi (employee of Zhang Yuan Xing Fresh Meat Store in Zhoujiaqiao near Beixinjing), Zhu Lianxing (worker in Nanzhu Lane in the west of Beixinjing), Wang Jinsheng (owner of Wang Yong Xing Fresh Meat Store in Beixinjing), and others to the court for a lengthy preliminary trial, and then ordered them to leave the court to await further instructions.</p>

In November of last year, he hired lawyers Yin Shijie and Wang Weizhen to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court, accusing Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of Penglai Market, of forging signatures and encroaching on beach land. This has been reported in the newspapers several times. After three trials by Judge Sun Jikang, the plaintiff's accusations were found to be untrue, and the procedure was also flawed. On December 20 of last year, the self-accusation was rejected. Later, Ling Yunzhai filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Local Court. Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia completed the investigation according to law and announced a decision not to prosecute yesterday. The evidence submitted by the original plaintiff and defendant has been returned by the original trial judge, Sun Jikang, respectively.</p>

<p>In your newspaper on the 4th of this month, on page 14, there was a news item about the cave on Yuntai Mountain collapsing under the pressure of snow, which began by saying that the Shanghai Sealand Joint Transportation Office of Longhai Road received an urgent telegram from Laoyao yesterday, which was very shocking. After checking, this office has not received the above-mentioned urgent telegram, nor has it published the aforementioned news. The content published in your newspaper must be a mistake based on hearsay. After checking, the transfer location for the Sealand Joint Transportation handled by this road and the China Merchants Bureau is Sunjiashan Station. All joint transportation goods are loaded as soon as they arrive, and there are daily telegrams to Shanghai. Since the Hairui Wheel arrived in Sun on the 3rd, more than 2,000 tons have been loaded one after another, which proves that the aforementioned news is not true. We hereby send this letter and ask you to check it and correct it immediately. To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Shanghai Joint Transportation Office of Longhai Railway Administration, February 7th.</p>
<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Usefulness of Dictionaries <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>I currently have a difficult problem, which perhaps many in society sympathize with. Therefore, I dare to raise it, requesting your department to study it.</p>
<p>My command of Chinese is generally adequate for ordinary use, and I believe I have some understanding of scholarly methods and choosing important books to read. However, I am troubled by my lack of English and my unfamiliarity with social science books. When reading new novels, I can only have a vague idea when encountering foreign allusions and terms. Furthermore, there are political science, psychology, and philosophy terms, as well as obscure phrases in classical literature. In these areas, even dictionaries are often unable to provide answers. On the other hand, I lack teachers and friends to ask questions and raise doubts. Therefore, once a doubt arises, it is difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Explaining such difficult words and phrases might be too trivial, and I imagine it falls outside the scope of your department's guidance. However, the fact remains before me, and if there are few others who feel the same way, then there is no problem; but if there are many, then your department will have to put in the effort to find a solution. It would be best if your department could expand its scope and take on the responsibility of answering difficult words and phrases. If you are too busy to handle it, perhaps you could consider a method and propose it for society's adoption.</p>
<p>I think even for those who are financially well-off, hiring teachers and making friends may be easy, but the categories of these difficult words and phrases are numerous, and one or two teachers and friends may not be able to answer them all completely.</p>

The decided events are summarized below. ㈠ "Elementary Chinese Language" (already compiled) Please Meng Xiancheng, Wu Shutang, Huang Jianzhong, and Zhao Ruisheng first decide on the inclusion or exclusion of the teaching material content, and then hand it over to Wu Yanin to revise. ㈡ "Advanced History" The proposed teaching material outline and content are divided into four periods: ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary. Each period has many large units, and each large unit is further divided into several small units. Approved with revisions and handed over to the two practical elementary schools of Nanzhong and Nanzhong Women's Middle School to be responsible for compiling based on the outline. ㈢ "Advanced Geography" The proposed teaching material outline (the content is divided into the central region, the northern region, the northeastern region, the northern region of Outer Mongolia, the western region, and the southern region, which is connected to the junior high school geography curriculum) was generally approved. Because the key points listed in each province and region in the outline still need to be revised, Li Yiting and Wang Jinxin were elected by the public to revise them, and then submitted to the next meeting for decision. (This subject was entrusted to the two practical elementary schools of Nanzhong and Nanzhong Women's Middle School to compile.) In addition, the "Elementary Arithmetic" that has been compiled has been decided by the previous meeting to be revised by Xue Tianhan and then submitted to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for review. "Elementary Society" and "Elementary Nature" have been revised according to the opinions of the Compilation and Translation Bureau, and the work of editing the book is currently underway, which is expected to be completed by the end of February. The Ministry of Education is compiling textbooks. For the elementary school part, the four subjects of Chinese language, arithmetic, society, and nature in the elementary level have all been compiled, and the second step of revision and review is being carried out. For the advanced level, in addition to the above-mentioned history and geography, the compilation outline of Chinese language and arithmetic has been completed but not yet discussed. The Chinese language is entrusted to the affiliated elementary school of Peiping Normal University to compile, and the arithmetic is entrusted to the Suzhou Middle School Practical Elementary School to compile. The advanced nature has been discussed last time and entrusted to the Central University Practical School to compile.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Various Schools in This City <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Comply with the School Calendar for Class</p>
<p>The Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Inspect in Different Ways</p>
<p>The Education Bureau of this city has recently found that some private schools do not comply with the school calendar for starting and ending school, resulting in considerable losses for students. For example, if the school holidays are advanced by half a month or delayed by half a month, the students will lose one month of study each semester, which is not a way to rectify the atmosphere of learning. The bureau believes that this matter is of great importance and strictly ordered all schools to comply with the school calendar. It is now known that all schools in this city this semester are able to start school as scheduled. Those who are unable to attend class for unavoidable reasons, such as the two schools of China Vocational and Fudan Affiliated Middle School, due to internships or building school buildings, have all submitted special requests to reschedule classes, which the bureau has reviewed and approved after sending personnel to investigate. Most of the schools that applied for delayed opening, such as Qingxin and other schools, have not been approved, and a quick letter has been sent to teachers and students to start classes earlier. It is heard that the bureau will send a large number of staff to inspect various schools in the coming days in order to enforce the previous order and urge the schools to earnestly rectify.</p>
<p>The City Education Bureau Orders all Private Middle Schools to Submit</p>
<h3 id="e238">The Overall Grades at the Time of Graduation by a Deadline <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>And Retroactively Recognize the Qualifications of Graduates Before Registration</p>
<p>The City Education Bureau specially issued an order yesterday to the private middle schools that have been registered in order to facilitate the retroactive recognition of the qualifications of graduates before registration and to submit the overall grades at the time of graduation by a deadline. The order stated: It has been found that the procedures for registered private secondary schools to request retroactive recognition of the qualifications of graduates before registration and to verify and seal certificates have been stipulated in the eighth and ninth announcements of the Ministry of Education, respectively, and have been notified by this bureau's No. 1795 order to comply with. Now, in order to facilitate the registered private secondary schools to retroactively recognize the qualifications of graduates before registration and verify and seal certificates, the procedures set by the Ministry have been slightly modified for handling. All schools that have submitted the registers of graduates of all previous years as scheduled before April 18 of last year shall submit the overall grades of each subject at the time of graduation of the graduates of all previous years before registration, and fill in the student's academic record card in detail, one for each person, and submit it to the bureau for approval and filing before March 15. The schools may then submit the graduation certificates one after another in accordance with the regulations on the graduation certificates of schools, along with two recent 2.5-inch half-length photos of the person, and request verification and sealing. Others who have not submitted the registers of graduates of all previous years to the bureau by the deadline, or whose reported registers do not conform to the format, as well as newly registered schools, will still handle the procedures for retroactive recognition of the qualifications of their graduates in accordance with the procedures set by the Ministry. In order to review the qualifications of graduates before registration and may review the test papers of each subject at ordinary times and at the time of graduation, check the grades, and order the submission of the admission qualification certificates and other supporting documents of each student. When necessary, the bureau may hold a re-examination on a regular basis. All the previous amendments to the retroactive recognition of the qualifications of graduates before the registration of private secondary schools in the war zone are hereby abolished. This order is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<p>After the Reorganization of Minli Girls' Middle School</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Opening Ceremony Was Held Yesterday <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, and Others Attended</p>
<p>More Than 600 Teachers, Staff, and Students Attended</p>
<p>Principal Tong Xingbai Presided and Reported</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the board of directors of Minli Girls' Middle School on Wenmiao Road and the election of Tong Xingbai as the new principal, everything inside has been arranged long ago. The staff has changed very little, and the students are particularly enthusiastic. Yesterday, the school held the spring commencement ceremony, with guests including Jiang Huaisu, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau, and school board members Wu Xingya, Yang Weiyu, Wang Yansong, Zhu Xinong, and more than 600 teachers, staff, and students, which was quite a grand occasion. Chairman Tong Xingbai presided over the ceremony. First, the chairman reported, saying that everyone has a kind of nervous emotion and enthusiastic state at the spring commencement ceremony of our school today, which has never happened before. Generally, after the reorganization of our school, what will be the impact on the future of teachers, staff, and students, and what is my attitude and proposition for running the school are urgently to be made clear, so I have to explain to you first. First, I am willing to be a good friend of Minli Girls' Middle School. The past advantages of our school should not only be retained, but also be promoted. The past shortcomings must also be improved to be perfect. All the students and teachers love our school, so my position is exactly the same as that of my brothers. Since the positions are the same, we should work together to seek the progress of school affairs. Secondly, my brothers came here to serve the main club purely, because the school is a social group, education is a national policy, and private schools are just educational undertakings run by the people, which are completely different from the nature of private property. Since the nature is clear, a clear understanding of this reorganization can be obtained. Again, my brothers have always held a view on things, that is, to do things and never to people. To be able to do things and do them well is a good thing. Those who do good things are good people. We can't ask for good people, so how can we let him idle? So we only ask whether things are done well, regardless of whether people are different or not. The above three points are clear, and we can understand each other, and all actions can proceed smoothly, which is of great benefit to the development of the school. In addition, as for what kind of policy should be adopted in the school's education and training, because the scope is too large, it cannot be fully described in a few words. However, seeing the current cultural crisis in China, I feel that girls' education in the future should create a kind of hard-working and striving news discipline to save the general youth's decadence and romantic enjoyment. Therefore, the school's education and training policy in the future should proceed in this direction. Secondly, Jiang Huaisu and Pan Gongzhan gave speeches successively, with many encouraging words. Finally, because Chairman Wu Xingya was not feeling well, school board member Yang Weiyu gave a speech on behalf of him, and then the ceremony was over.</p>

<p>Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School The Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan has been established for ten years. The school's complete equipment and the seriousness of teaching have long been well-known in Shanghai, and the excellent performance of the graduates in various places at home and abroad has always been praised by the society. Even this year's graduates have been invited by letters and telegrams from various places. Some of the later invitations from Nanyang and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are not enough to be distributed. It is heard that the number of students in the school has increased in recent years, and the original places are still not enough. Now, a track and field and tennis court have been added to the left side of the school. Various facilities are still being added. In terms of teaching affairs, we are seeking more strictness in order to hope that Xinxin students can gain more real academic knowledge. Therefore, the number of new students who go to register these days is exceptionally high. The school is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month and start classes on the 12th.</p>
<p>Guoguang Middle School The private Guoguang Middle School on Yuyuan Road was founded last year. Thanks to the hard work of Yu Shun, manager of Sanbei Company, and Principal Qian Huizong, the achievements of the teachers and staff have been remarkable. This semester, due to the sharp increase in the number of students, the primary school department will be moved to the new house of Suoxian Xiaozhu, Duinong, Yuyuan New Village. Recently, Zhang Juzhan, a bachelor of mining science from Beiyang University, was hired as the Director of Training, Qian Gongdu, a bachelor of science from Guanghua University, as the Director of Teaching Affairs, and Zhang Lanshi, a bachelor of arts from St. John's University, as a teacher.</p>
<p>The First Vocational Supplementary School of the Vocational Education Society The First Vocational Supplementary School attached to the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road in this city has achieved remarkable results since its establishment.

<p>Triangular Port Football Match</p>
<h3 id="e246">The Tianjin Team is the Strongest <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The Final Lineup is Scheduled to Go South Tomorrow</p>
<p>Hong Kong Will Also Divide into Two Teams to Face Tianjin and Shanghai</p>
<p>The triangular port football match between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin will be held in Shanghai starting from the abolished lunar new year. The players from Shanghai and Hong Kong have all been decided and announced. The players from Hong Kong will start their journey north today.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Tianjin's Strongest Team <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Tianjin, according to recent news, there have been slight changes in the lineup, but its strength remains above Shanghai and Hong Kong. The entire team of fifteen players is scheduled to depart Tianjin tomorrow for the south. The newly determined lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Chuer</p>
<p>Masaskov, Dala, Mishakov, Sun Sijing, Hale, Roseburg, Jefferson, Roger, Jones, Fincher Swiss</p>
<p>Reserves: Jiang Lu, Beatty, Van Leshav. Captain Jefferson, Vice-Captain Hale, Secretary Frau Ste, Coach and Manager Roger. Tianjin's right-back Da Silva was injured during practice and is currently unable to travel south. Therefore, he has been replaced by goalkeeper Mishakov, with reserve Masaskov as the goalkeeper. Ma is the goalkeeper for Tianjin Sagor and is skilled. Center forward A. Chuer has been moved to left wing, and veteran Roger will play center forward. In 1928, the Tianjin team traveled south and defeated Shanghai 5-4. At that time, Luo was a left inside forward. Jefferson and Fincher Swiss are familiar to people in Shanghai. All five forwards are good at scoring, making them the strongest of the three ports. The midfield is on par with the Shanghai team. Hale is good at headers and is known as "Three Feet," referring to his head. This is the first time Dala and Mishakov have been selected as interport representatives. Dala, Hale, and A. Chuer are all players from the British Army in Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Hong Kong Team's Weak Goalkeeper <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong has changed its lineup three times. The one announced yesterday is the final decision. It is most regrettable that the reliable goalkeeper Bao Jiaping cannot come. The current Mai Hatai is very weak, even weaker than Kirk. Kirk is the backup for Bao Jiaping's absence. Now Kirk is also unable to travel north. The five forwards are also very fierce. The Gao brothers, both senior and junior, have been interport representatives seven times, and their cooperation with Tan Jiangbai is extremely wonderful. Redley is a player from the Lincoln team and performed excellently in Shanghai. The Hong Kong team played a practice match against the Chinese United team in Hong Kong for three days, resulting in a 5-5 draw. The battle report from Hong Kong is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 4th dispatch) The Hong Kong Football Association, to review the strength of the interport team that will compete in Shanghai, specifically arranged a match against the Chinese United team yesterday at the Kowloon Association stadium. Under the gaze of thousands of spectators, the fierce battle lasted for ninety minutes. The representative team of the English Elite Club was unable to defeat the seemingly weak Chinese United team, ending in a 5-5 draw, showing that the personnel selection of the Association still needs improvement, and it is difficult to be optimistic about the future competition in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Significant Difference in Strength Comparison <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>The interport team lineup is actually composed of top players selected from various teams, and after several practices, it is carefully compiled by the personnel selection committee based on their opinions. It should have strong strength and a complete lineup. The Chinese United team is only selected from the South China and China teams, and good players have already been drawn into the interport team, so there is obviously a difference in strength between the two teams.</p>
<h3 id="e250">The Chinese Team Performed Better Yesterday <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>However, in yesterday's match, the Chinese team performed better. The personnel selection of the Football Association has always been influenced by favoritism. In the first half of yesterday's match, there was not much criticism of the forward line. The three central defenders, Piro, Piru, and Storrance (captain), were difficult to stop the Chinese team's cavalry charge. Goalkeeper Mai Hatai is indeed a second-rate talent, hardly qualified. The lineup prepared for the second half against Tianjin was even weaker. Players like Lian En, Yidai Bili Diano, etc., are actually among the weaker players in Group A, yet they were selected as interport representatives. The vision of the Association's personnel selection committee is truly lacking. The Chinese team performed very well yesterday. Even though Liu Mao, Huang Jiliang, and Liang Xianzan did not play, everyone was able to give their best. If Li Guozu had been a little calmer and not lost one or two goals, then the Chinese team would have won. The lineups of both sides are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e251">Chinese United Team <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>

<p>Medina Appears in Two Matches Today</p>
<p>Farewell Performance at the Western Youth Association on the 15th</p>
<p>World professional billiards master Willie Smith's wonderful skills have been fully exposed in the past two days of performances and have been well received by the audience. Shanghai Mayor Wu, accompanied by Secretary-General Yu and Secretary Zhang Tingrong, watched from the sidelines yesterday. Whenever there was an exciting moment, he either nodded or applauded in praise, and he whispered to Secretary-General Yu to comment. It seems that Mayor Wu is also an expert in billiards. After the competition, this famous professional quickly thanked Mayor Wu for his presence and hoped to receive guidance. Mayor Wu encouraged him and wished him progress in his art. With Mayor Wu's appreciation, the billiards business in Shanghai is expected to flourish.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Two Matches Today <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Today is the last day for Smith to perform at the United China General Association. His opponent at 9:15 is Medina, one of the famous amateur players in Shanghai, who is hailed as the king alongside Li Gongying in our country, and is worth watching. Englishman Combs will appear at 6 pm. Mr. Combs is an outstanding member of the British community in Shanghai. Both matches will have amazing performances.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Farewell Performance <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Manluo, Chairman of the Billiards Committee of the Western Youth Association, has agreed with Mr. Smith to give a farewell performance at the Association on the 15th, and has invited our country's billiards king Li Gongying to participate. It is expected that it will attract countless spectators. The venue has limited seating, and tickets must be purchased in advance at the Association from the 10th. The prices are divided into one yuan and two yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Yesterday's Competition <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Smith's first performance was not as good as before, scoring a total of 999 points. The huge scores were all within 200 points, such as 156, 100, 200, 190, 117. Liu Fuzong from our country worked hard and performed well, scoring a total of 183 points. In the second match, Smith restored his omnipotent magical skills, and the surrounding audience was unanimously impressed. He scored 1071 points with five shots, with huge points of 425 and 296. Portuguese player Combs lived up to expectations, with a steady hand, but his shots were not good enough, otherwise he would have exceeded his current score of 22...</p>
<p>Chinese Basketball Court is Full</p>
<h3 id="e257">Maklin Defeats Zhanghua in the Group B Final <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>74-51 Zhanghua, though strong, can only hold out for five minutes.</p>
<p>Maklin's performance is unexpectedly wonderful.</p>
<p>The Pirates have won the Group A championship.</p>
<p>The Shanghai basketball Group B final between Zhanghua and Maklin was held last night at the Chinese basketball court surrounded by over a thousand spectators. Maklin's performance was magical. Zhanghua only had a slight advantage in the first five minutes. After that, they were defeated and unable to control the situation. Maklin was tall, agile, with excellent passing, and especially accurate shooting. Zhanghua's Qian Jingyong had accurate vision, but his shots were not opportune. They were behind 22-41 in the first half, and the total result was 74-51. The Pirates have completed the Group A order. Yesterday they defeated the Jews easily and will wait for the Group B winner to compete for the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Wonderful Performance <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The first five minutes of the performance were full of wonderful moments. Zhanghua went all out, with an overwhelming momentum, and seemed invincible. They were very well coordinated and creatively won. But after 12-12, Maklin suddenly rose sharply and was unstoppable. Zhanghua's defense could not contain its momentum. Sun Baoqing was too short, Lu Zhongen could not take care of everyone, and Chen Xianglong repeatedly allowed Locke to sneak in, creating a surging tide. The ball went to the enemy's hand and was instantly at the basket. Three forwards surrounded it, and nineteen shots were made. Zhanghua's Chen Xianglong ran slower, and it was difficult to cooperate with Feng Qian. Moreover, they could not win the jump balls in the middle, so the momentum of the ball was always at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Golden Age <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>After Lu Zhongen opened the scoring in the first half, he committed two fouls in a row, and he could not help but feel anxious. At the same time, Maklin's Bie Xupo also committed two fouls in a row, which was a coincidence. Mou Lei penalized Lu Zhongen, and Qian Jingyong penalized Bie Xupo, each adding one point, making it 3-1. Le Ai scored to make it 3-3. Maklin called a timeout, and Bie Xupo attacked from the rear, adding two points. Maklin then took the lead at 5-3. Lu Zhongen advanced and coordinated, and made a wonderful shot six yards in front of the basket. Qian Jingyong made two corner shots, which were extraordinary, making it 9-5, Zhanghua's golden age. The performance was so good that it was worth seeing.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Gradually Balancing <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Maklin's momentum gradually rose, with an aggressive attitude. Zhanghua suffered greatly due to the disadvantage of jump balls in the middle. Initially, Chen Xianglong blocked Locke's shot, but the ball was hit and he was penalized again, losing three points to make it 9-8. Qian Jingyong scored again, and Chen Xianglong added one point, making it 12-8, still taking the lead. Bie Xupo made two long shots ten yards in front of the basket, making it 12-12. From then on, Zhanghua's golden age passed. The previous persistence and struggle of Zhanghua, which repeatedly took the lead, was because the defense was still able to contain the enemy's attack.</p>
<h3 id="e261">The Good Times Are Gone <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The flowers are not always in bloom, and the good times are gone. Zhanghua's strategy has not changed. Lu Zhongen still goes forward to assist the forwards, causing the rear to be empty. When the shots are missed, and the ball falls into the hands of the enemy, Maklin's two forwards have already sprinted to the basket. Zhanghua could not return in time, so the ball was lost one after another. Maklin continuously increased their score by ten points. Feng Nianhua opened his personal record. Locke shot with both left and right hands, and was able to shoot from any position. From then on, the situation was very different. Zhanghua was twice as far behind in scoring. In the first half, Maklin scored 41 points, and Zhanghua scored 21 points.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Situation Is Disparate <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>As the battle started again, Feng Nianhua gradually began to show promise. Maklin's Le Ai and Bie Xupo retreated and were replaced by Boris and Ge Lak. Boris made two shots out of two. Zhanghua tried to struggle. Feng Nianhua was much more active than in the first half, making two consecutive shots. Qian Jingyong also added one point. His technique and vision were very skilled and accurate. Three consecutive shots. In less than a minute, the situation seemed to be improving again, 30-45, a difference of fifteen points. But in reality, it was difficult. Moreover, Maklin's momentum had not diminished. In a moment, Boris and Mou Lei added ten points again. From then on, Zhanghua was often behind by more than twenty points.</p>
<h3 id="e263">The Trend Has Been Determined <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The situation became a torrent, and the situation was determined. Maklin still deployed troops from time to time, and Zhanghua also rose and fell from time to time. They once scored eight points in a row, but the gains did not make up for the losses, 38-56, a difference of eighteen points. Locke and Mou Lei added icing on the cake, making it 66-38, a difference of 28 points. After that, the situation gradually declined, and the audience scattered like birds and beasts, and the scene was chaotic. Zhanghua made a final struggle, adding up to 51 points, while Maklin had 74 points. Then the time ended.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Getting What They Deserve <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Zhanghua's defeat was not expected to be so many points lost. However, Zhanghua's performance was still beautiful. What was lacking was that the running and passing was still too slow. Maklin's victory has its own special techniques. Zhanghua is still far behind. The reason why the Western Youth Basketball Pirates lost to Maklin was that the court was too small, not enough for Maklin's activities. Now that Zhanghua has been defeated, Maklin can win the Group B championship. In the future, when Maklin and the Pirates meet again, the Pirates will find the court too large and unable to use their skills. Maklin will win the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Ma Rufei's Humor <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the end of the lunar year, storytellers are always mobilized to hold large-scale storytelling events at various storytelling venues inside and outside the city. Among them, when talking about the elder Mr. Ma Rufei, those who tell short stories always give him a thumbs up, saying that he is the one and only leader in the storytelling world.</p>
<p>I was born too late to hear Ma Rufei's wonderful storytelling, but when I was a child, I heard Mr. Lao Dan, who had listened to Ma Rufei's storytelling, say that Ma Rufei's humorous arguments could be considered the Eastern Bernard Shaw. I occasionally recall them and briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>Ma Rufei met a stranger and asked each other's names. Ma said, "It's strange (奇哉)." Ma knew that the guest was joking, using the homophone for "strange (奇)" to mean "riding (騎)," which was a bit malicious. So he asked the guest, "Is your father healthy?" The guest said, "Still healthy." He asked again, "What about your mother?" The guest said, "Unfortunately, she is gone (失恃)." Ma repeatedly sighed and said, "How strange (奇煞哉)!" The guest could not help but feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>When Ma Rufei told stories, he had a great appeal. The storytelling venue was often crowded with people. The venue owner was greedy and forgot his righteousness, reporting fewer people and pocketing the rest of the money, which was called "eating heads." Ma knew about it, but pretended not to know. After finishing his storytelling, he stepped down from the stage and exchanged greetings with the venue owner. First, he asked the venue owner, "How is your health?" The venue owner said, "Thanks to you, still healthy (窮健)." Ma then asked, "How is your diet?" The venue owner said, "Two bowls per meal." Ma repeatedly urged, "Be careful when eating." The venue owner's face immediately became hot.</p>
<p>Ma Rufei had a temper. When the show had been going on for too long, he liked to cause some trouble and break up the show. When Ma was performing at Sanwanchang, he heard that there was a young man among the audience who was the son of someone from the Water Conservancy Bureau. He was specifically making trouble in the venue. Not only did the audience hate it, but Ma also despised him. One day, Ma was telling a joke in an interlude, briefly saying, "The Dragon King was lecturing on the Dragon Treasury True Scripture in the Crystal Palace. All the aquatic creatures had to enter the palace on time to listen to the lecture, or they would be refused entry. At that time, all the aquatic creatures reported in one by one, but the turtle walked slowly and missed the time. By the time it crawled to the Crystal Palace, the palace gate was already tightly closed. The turtle had no choice but to lie in the water and wait. After a while, the lecture was over, and the palace gate opened. The turtle then slowly walked up to the palace. The Dragon King scolded, "You turtle, why didn't you listen to the lecture?" The turtle said, "The little one was listening." The Dragon King said, "Where were you listening?" The turtle said, "The little one was listening in the water." When the interlude reached this point, the audience all laughed at the son of the Water Conservancy Bureau. The man was furious, waving his fists and sleeves, and broke up the show into chaos. The venue owner cried out in pain, but Ma Rufei was happy.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Madame Someone <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shan</p>
<p>Madame Someone, I forgot her last name. But she is always Madame Someone's, and the mother of Someone's five children.</p>
<p>Madame Someone's father was a genuine scholar, so Madame Someone received a "good" education from a young age.</p>
<p>Her father knew that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue," so Madame Someone now only recognizes a few characters the size of watermelons. Her father knew that a woman should have "the four virtues of obedience," so he kept Madame Someone locked in her "boudoir" all day long, not allowing her to come out.</p>
<p>I don't remember the year Madame Someone arrived at Someone's house. Madame Someone herself doesn't remember either. However, Madame Someone has never argued with Someone since she arrived at his house, and she has given birth to five children, two girls and three boys, and there is one in her belly, and no one knows if it's a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>Although Madame Someone has not read many books, she recognizes a few characters, and these characters are all very practical for Madame Someone, like: the East, South, West, North, Middle, Fortune, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, 1, 2, 3, ... 9 in "Mahjong." She is very familiar with what Fang Maolin, Tian Fusang, etc. are in the "Flower Club." Even with her eyes closed, she can think of: Tian is square, but Fang is not square. Not only that, she also knows that Fang Maolin is a monk, and Tian Fusang is a dog. Madame Someone knows the rest, but I only know these. If you want to know, you can ask Madame Someone.</p>
<p>Madame Someone's talent is like this. Madame Someone's ability is also great: she can take a four-year-old child, hold a two-year-old daughter, and carry a child that is already seven months in her belly to play "Mahjong." If you list her daily work on a table, you will be speechless after reading it.</p>
<p>"Get up at eight in the morning, first dress and wash the children, then wash yourself. After washing, prepare the noodle water with Sheng Sheng, it is already nine o'clock. Then take the four-year-old child and the two-year-old daughter to the small vegetable market to buy vegetables. When you get home, you cook rice and tidy up the room. After tidying up, cook vegetables. The children are clamoring to eat. After all the hard work of cooking, after eating, play "Bamboo City" with the neighbor's sister-in-law, the landlady across the street, and the teacher's wife in the attic, twelve rounds, twenty-four rounds, day and night. There is no time to cook dinner, so eat noodles."</p>
<p>Madame Someone's daily work is roughly like this. She doesn't need a maid. The reasons are: 1. Maids need money and food. 2. I am afraid that the maids will "skim" and report false accounts. 3. It's very annoying.</p>
<p>I haven't seen Madame Someone since the January 28th Incident. I don't know where she went.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Drinking and Dining, Merry-Making Filled with Tears of Farewell</p>
<p>Burning the Midnight Oil, Sweet Dreams Murmuring Through the Long Night</p>
<p>Old Master Zhao, in the room across, heard his son laughing heartily, which he found quite puzzling. He stuck his head out of his doorway to look, only to see the curtain of the bridal chamber hanging low, and the sound inside had ceased. He thought to himself, young people are young people after all; such a new marriage followed by departure to join the army, no one can truly bear it. Yet they're still laughing and making merry in their confusion. After a long while, he finally heard the couple coming out together. It turned out they had agreed to go out and buy ingredients for making馅饼 [xiàn bǐng - stuffed pancakes]. As they walked to the front courtyard, their laughter still reached the back courtyard, so they must have been very happy indeed. Half an hour later, Ziqiang came in, his face still bearing a look of worry. Old Master Zhao asked, "Where have you been?" Ziqiang said, "She wanted to make stuffed pancakes for me to eat and insisted I go with her to buy the ingredients, so I had to accompany her. Actually, I don't really want to eat anything." As he spoke, he sat down lazily on a chair. Old Master Zhao said, "She seems very happy. Is it because you said you would bring her out to join you in the future?" Ziqiang pondered for a moment and said, "Maybe..." After speaking, he let out a long sigh. The curtain was lifted, and Guizhi skipped in with a smile, saying to Old Master Zhao, "Father, I'm making stuffed pancakes for you to eat, okay?" Old Master Zhao nodded. Guizhi smiled and said, "Ziqiang is leaving tomorrow, and I'm giving him a farewell feast. Can we have a little wine?" Old Master Zhao saw that she seemed truly happy, and said with a smile, "Logically, you can let him have a cup of farewell wine. But he has to catch the early bus tomorrow morning. If he drinks too much, he won't be able to get up." Guizhi smiled and said, "If he drinks at dinner tonight, he won't be able to wake up tomorrow morning? He'd have to drink a whole jar!" As she spoke, she gave Ziqiang a playful glance and said, "How much can you drink? We'll make a bet." After speaking, she went off with a laugh. Old Master Zhao, seeing her like this, was puzzled. Ziqiang laughed and said, "She's completely childish. She said she's going to sit with me and talk until dawn tonight." Old Master Zhao said, "Don't act like a child. When you get to Leizhou, you'll have to walk. The weather is getting colder. I imagine the area around the Great Wall is colder than here, right?" (242)</p>
<h3 id="e275">Insomnia <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zi</p>
<p>Because I am a person who cherishes life and fears death the most, whenever I feel a little unwell, I rush to the doctor. The first thing I always say is, "Doctor, will this ailment kill me?" As a result, not only have I not died so far, but also, because I sought treatment early, I haven't even suffered a major illness once.</p>
<p>But now, I have contracted a very pitiful ailment, which is the so-called "insomnia." Not long ago, I seem to have seen an article in a newspaper titled "City Sickness," which also mentioned "insomnia." Indeed, insomnia is a condition that is most likely to affect city dwellers because the causes of insomnia invariably boil down to love and economic issues. And city dwellers are constantly turning somersaults in these two areas all day long. So, how can you expect them not to suffer from insomnia!</p>
<p>However, the reason I suffer from insomnia is neither due to love nor economics, but because I have a few mixed-up small problems that are difficult to solve, and I unknowingly thought too much, leading to insomnia. But let's put aside the reasons for my insomnia for now and just talk about the situation after suffering from insomnia.</p>
<p>I don't know how I was awakened that night. The short hand on the clock hadn't even reached eleven o'clock, and yet my sleepiness had completely vanished. At first, I lay quietly, not paying much attention. After more than an hour, I still couldn't fall back asleep. I suddenly remembered what I had read in a book, so I silently counted one, two, three, four, five, six... Unexpectedly, the more I counted, the more awake I became, and I could barely stay in bed. So, I took a second step: I quickly got up, washed my feet with hot water until the skin on my feet turned completely red. I thought this would surely draw the blood away from my brain, so I quickly crawled back into bed. But it was no use. I tossed and turned until daybreak. The next day, I rushed to find a doctor. Unexpectedly, the doctor said, "There is no cure for insomnia, you can only restrain your thoughts." Oh dear! This is terrible!*</p>
<p>It may be possible to force a person not to eat delicacies and only eat plain rice. It may not even be too difficult to force him to keep his eyes closed all day and not look at anything. But it is absolutely impossible to force him not to think. At the time, I was very angry that the doctor didn't prescribe any medicine for me, especially because I feared that this incurable insomnia might end my life. So, I angrily went to buy a bottle of sleeping pills. But the clerk at the pharmacy had the best of intentions and repeatedly told me not to take them if possible. He wasn't afraid that I would commit suicide, but rather that I would become addicted. So, I can only not take them, and I am still struggling in the pain of insomnia.</p>

<h3 id="e276">Method for Making Preserved Meat and Dried Fish <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>It's the middle of winter, the time of the year for腊 [là, the twelfth lunar month] offerings. Residents can take advantage of this time to make some preserved meat and dried fish. If you make it after the start of spring, it will go bad. I remember one year when I had already passed the start of spring, my family salted a few hams. Who knew that by the time summer began, many small black worms had crawled out of the meat, and I didn't dare eat it after that. So, you must salt the meat in the twelfth lunar month.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about making preserved meat: Go to the butcher shop and choose several large hind legs (preferably pigs that eat bean cakes). Bring them back and put them in an open-mouthed jar. Put on a new straw sandal (you can also rub it with your hand, but it's very painful). Use a handful of salt and rub it hard on the skin, several times. Stop only when the skin of the meat starts to sweat. Then turn it over and rub the lean meat inside, also rubbing it a lot. Finally, rub the shanks and hooves. The amount of salt to use is ten to twelve ounces for a large leg of meat. You can't use too little. Once all the legs of meat are rubbed, place them flat in the jar and put several clean large stones on top to weigh them down. The next day, go to the butcher shop and ask for a small bowl of硝露 [xiāo lù - saltpetre solution] and pour it into the jar. After that, turn the meat over every day, rotating its position. After three weeks or so, take the meat out of the jar. Tie each piece with straw rope and hang it under the eaves to dry in the sun. In the evening, take it down and soak it in the jar, weighing it down with stones. Take it out the next day to dry again. After drying it in the sun for seven or eight days, hang the meat in a shady, windy place and let it dry naturally. If you dry it any longer, the meat will become tough. When bamboo shoots are in season, chop off a large piece and cook it with bamboo shoots. Or you can eat it in June. The taste is unmatched, because this preserved meat is really more delicious than ham and Nanjing spiced meat. It's both fresh and tender.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about making dried fish: Around the 20th of the twelfth lunar month, buy a dozen catties of live large mackerel. Bring them back, slaughter them (do not wash them or remove the scales), remove the contents of the belly, and cut them in half (the head and tail should be cooked separately. Simmer the whole fish head with ham and 冬菇 [dōng gū - shiitake mushrooms] for an excellent taste, and the head also has a lot of brain). Cut them into sections, and lightly rub each section on both sides with salt. Place them in a large bowl or small jar, rubbing one section and then placing it in the jar. After all the sections are rubbed and arranged evenly, press a few small stones on the fish to keep them tightly packed together, leaving no gaps, or else the cats will steal them to eat. Around the middle of the first lunar month, take the fish out. Use thread for stitching shoe soles to string up each piece and hang them on a bamboo pole to dry in the sun for five or six days. Then hang them in a ventilated place. Around the tenth of the second lunar month, take the fish down, wash them clean, remove the scales, and cut them into squares (or leave them whole). Use a towel to absorb the moisture and dry them in the sun briefly. Take them in, put them in a large porcelain lion jar, pour in some 高梁 [gāo liáng - sorghum] wine. The amount of wine should almost cover the fish. At that time, you can also cut a few slices of preserved meat and put them in. Then buy some 酒酿 [jiǔ niàng - fermented glutinous rice] and spread it on top. The amount is up to you. If you want to add peppercorns to the fish, you can add eight or nine, but you don't have to. Then put the lid on and seal it with oilcloth on the outside. Around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival, take a few pieces and put them in a bowl, add some scallions, and steam them in the rice pot to eat? It really has a unique flavor. The fish is fragrant and tender and goes well with rice, no less than the dried fish sold in the market, and the price is much cheaper!</p>
<h3 id="e277">Shantou's Oyster Omelette <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Chang</p>
<p>Shantou is close to the sea, and aquatic products are extremely abundant. Among these abundant aquatic products, oysters are one of the most famous. Those who gather oysters are mostly villagers near Shantou. Although they do not form large groups, they often accompany each other to chisel them from the rocks and the base pillars of the docks along the sea. Oysters are shellfish that parasitize on rocks and wooden pillars near the water. The chiselers wait for low tide and only need to use a piece of iron to chisel away the shells to get the oyster meat. However, some also chisel off the oysters along with their shells, put them in buckets, and carry them home to leisurely open the oyster shells.</p>
<p>The oyster meat that is dug out is milky white and has a texture as soft as cotton. It also tastes sweet and delicious. Because it has no blood, those who abstain from killing often take it as an aid to their meals, regarding it as the ultimate food.</p>
<p>(Note) The Chaoshan people often call "oyster omelette" "蚝劣" [háo liè]. The character "劣" [liè] is taken for its pronunciation. For convenience, I take its meaning and call it "蠔煎" [háo jiān - oyster omelette].</p>

<p>The New Year is Approaching</p>
<p>Big Speculators in Bullion Gradually Disappearing</p>
<p>American Equalization Fund Not Yet Used</p>
<p>Market is Stable and Improves by Three and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market had few transactions, the range was narrow, and the market situation was quite stable and lacked changes. Initially, the overseas silver market in both the UK and the US rose, and the forward silver price on the metal exchange also rose by two to two and a half points. Exchange rates consistently continued to rise. London spot gold fell back by two shillings and nine pence. US cotton rose by seven points, US wheat fell by two and three-eighths, stocks fell by two yuan and twenty-nine cents, and the wool market opened lower at 700 yuan. However, with the rise in exchange rates, there were still buyers taking advantage of the low prices, pushing it up to over 700 yuan. The situation was stable, gradually moving upwards. Reuters reported that the US $2,000,000,000 equalization fund had not yet been used. The general observation is that this matter has been delayed for discussions with the UK on stability. The price once rose, but soon fell back. However, transactions were light, the range was very narrow, and the market situation was stagnant. Later market transactions were even scarcer and the trend remained stable. The market situation remained swirling, and the shape was mediocre. With the exchange rate based on shillings as the settlement price, and with the Lunar New Year approaching, both bulls and bears lacked special interest. The April contract will use the market weight, and because the US dollar has reduced its fineness, the settlement price will change, and the target gold price will be over one thousand yuan, and the reduced price will be one thousand one hundred and twenty-six yuan. Now, the market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 701 yuan and three cents, slightly higher than the previous close of three cents. Goods opened at one yuan and seven cents. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at one shilling, four pence and three one two five, and the US exchange at thirty-three yuan and eight seven five. The market was flat and weak at the start, but then Yuan Mao, Yongyi, Chengrichang, Yida, Yong etc. successively submitted strips, and rose from one yuan and two cents to three yuan and three cents. The HSBC posting revealed that the British was flat and the US rose one two five. However, due to Hengyu selling off, it dropped to two yuan and four cents. Sumitomo bought US dollars for five pence at thirty-four yuan and one eight seven five, Zhejiang ate the March contract at thirty-three yuan and nine three seven five. Yifeng, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Zhaofeng, Changda, Decheng etc. advanced to four yuan and a half. Shanghai clogged the May US dollar at one two five, Huabi came out the March US dollar at eight seven five. Shunmao, Yuanmao, Yonghong, Lisunli etc. sold to two yuan and eight cents, but because Zhengjin was still buying the May US dollar at one two five, goods slightly appreciated and once rose back to three yuan and six cents. Finally, Huixiang sold off, and the afternoon closed back to 702 yuan and six cents, and goods were priced at two yuan and eight cents.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 703 yuan and two cents, goods opened at two yuan and nine cents. Dachangxiang advanced to four yuan and three cents, Zhengjin set the roots clogging the April contract at thirty-four yuan, Datong came out the May US dollar at money one two five. Although Hengxing, Daxing, Yongheng Yu etc. sold, but because Dachangxiang, Dadecheng goods etc. all took in, speculator Mr. Yang advanced strips, and once rose to four yuan and nine cents, because Zhengjin Zhejiang had bought the May US dollar at one eight seven five. Before long, Citibank clogged the April contract at thirty-four yuan, Fuyu, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang etc. sold together, and Yifengyong, although advancing, still dropped to three yuan and one cent, Citibank clogged the April US dollar at zero six two five, Mitsui came out the May contract at one eight seven five, Dachangxiang took advantage of the low prices and still advanced, and returned to within four yuan. After entry, Qingfa Yong came to buy with a limit price, and once jumped to over four yuan and a half. The closing price was 704 yuan and a half, and goods were priced at five yuan. After the market closed, Hengxing etc. slightly advanced, and goods were being lifted up, jumping to five yuan and a half, Wanxing sold strongly, and still dropped to within five yuan. Checking the highest price of the day was 704 yuan and nine cents, and the lowest price was 701 yuan and two cents, with an up-down movement of three yuan and seven cents. As a result, it rose by three yuan and a half compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was calculated at one shilling, four pence and one two five because the HSBC Bank British exchange posting did not move, resulting in a target gold price converted by exchange rates of over 716 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately pressing down by twelve yuan, which was about three yuan less than the previous close. The registered amount for this month was 717 yuan, and the March amount was 703 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 717 yuan, and the supplementary water in the afternoon was 719 yuan. The reduced price was one thousand one hundred and twenty-six yuan, because London spot gold had seen a fall back. There were still eager buyers in the market, and the banks also had to take in food. Yingfeng Heng and Dadecheng etc. bought in, and the Tianjin gang sold. Over one thousand taels were traded, from one thousand one hundred and twenty-six yuan and a half up to thirty-one yuan. First low and then high. In addition, Dadecheng etc. sold to the Guangdong gang ordinary goods at one thousand one hundred and twenty-two yuan and a half. The February strips still had six thousand four hundred and thirty-three strips left.</p>
<p>Market transactions were light. In summary, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengyu, Fuyu, Hengtai, Sida, Dachangxiang, Futaiheng, Huixiang etc. were on the selling side. Yifengyong, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yongde, Yuanchun, Yidayong, Yuanmao, Tongchun, Dachangxiang, XieKang etc. were on the buying side. Hengchangyongyicheng advanced and then exited. Hengxingyidayong first exited and then advanced. The Dalian gang and Shunli did a total of over one thousand, rolling out over nine hundred strips. Wanxing did a total of over one thousand one hundred strips, rolling out over five hundred strips. The Guangdong gang Hengxing advanced before exiting and had limited transactions. The total number of transactions for the day was 10,577 strips in the morning market and 6,622 strips in the afternoon market. The March chips, as of today, totaled 29,316 strips, with a total of 33 bulls and 59 bears.</p>
<p>New Bullion Settlement Price</p>
<h3 id="e279">April Term Implemented <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>The gold exchange settlement price issue has been resolved at yesterday's meeting. The March contracts will be based on the British and American exchange rates, without hedging, and will be settled at the end of March. As for the April contracts (using the market weight), they will still be based on the US dollar settlement price. However, because the US dollar has already reduced its fineness, after calculation, starting from April, US$346 will be equal to one strip of bullion, starting from February 20th, the April term trading will begin (this is because a part of the hedgers bear the risks during the customs closure period, and there is a saying that the April trading should be started early during the Lunar New Year).</p>
<p>The Inevitability of Japanese Rice Dumping in China</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Japanese Government is Determined to Do it at a Loss <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>It is Difficult for China to Prevent It from Coming</p>
<p>Since the rumor that Japan intends to dump its surplus rice in China, the grain industry and government authorities in this city have paid attention to it and issued statements, believing that there may be no possibility of Japanese rice dumping in China. A reporter from this newspaper specially visited a gentleman who specializes in the study of people's food problems. According to his conversation and the statistics he presented on the import quantity and value of rice from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, the dumping of Japanese rice in China may still be possible despite the low price of rice. The gentleman said,</p>
<p>"Since Japan implemented the Rice Control Law, it has already shown signs of being overstretched. Although human labor is said to be omnipotent, it still has many shortcomings when under severe pressure from nature. The most difficult aspects of the Rice Control Law are the setting of official prices and the maintenance of rice prices. The method of maintaining these prices is for the government to invest in purchasing rice. Regardless of what happens after the purchase, the government may not have this power at the time of purchase, and stopping abruptly may cause resentment among the people. Continuously buying up rice will eventually exhaust financial resources, so if Japan truly has a bumper harvest, it must find another way out. Otherwise, the Japanese government will also be difficult to be this large hoarder. According to the current situation, the Japanese parliament is asking questions like this, and the Japanese cabinet is anxiously seeking remedies. This surplus of ten million 石 [shí - approximately 180 liters] of rice, if stored in Japan, will have no good opportunity for Japanese rice. Rather than caring about the loss of this ten million 石 of surplus rice, and letting the rice price fall to a point where it cannot be maintained, causing peasant riots and the cabinet to collapse, it would be better to endure the pain and sacrifice, dispose of this ten million 石 of surplus rice clearly, so that Japanese farmers can rest and the Japanese government can also slightly relieve the pain of buying surplus rice.</p>
<p>The dumping of rice from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea in China has four routes. First, the three northeastern provinces occupied by the Japanese puppet regime. The three northeastern provinces sometimes rely on Korean rice for supply, and because the soil is connected and the Koreans and Manchus live together, it is common to adjust each other's surpluses and shortages. Now, under the occupation of the Japanese, the door is wide open, and dumping is not a problem. The second is Tianjin and other places in North China, because of the Japanese concessions, activities are naturally convenient. In recent years, the Tianjin merchant group has purchased a considerable amount of粳米 [jīng mǐ - Japonica rice] from Shanghai, which is an opportunity to promote Japanese rice. As for the Yangtze River area, it is a rice-producing area, and dumping is originally not easy, but our country has absolutely no statistics on rice production and sales, so whether the high or low price of rice today is a problem of rice itself, or whether the farmers' economy is bankrupt and they cannot store it and provide it all to the market, causing the price of rice to fall, if this is the case, then the low price of rice at the moment may have hope of returning to normal after February or March of this year. If the rice price is high, Japanese rice may take the opportunity to invade. At that time, the hub for its dumping will be Shanghai, where Japanese warships and ships gather. As for the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, they are the sales area for foreign rice, especially the areas of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Fuzhou in Fujian, which are small in area and densely populated. Before Taiwan was ceded to Japan, Taiwanese rice was the only supply for Fujian province. After Taiwan was ceded to Japan, with the efforts of the Japanese to develop it, coupled with two harvests a year, rice production increased quite rapidly, far beyond what it was in the Qing dynasty. Even in the last ten years, the increase has been large. In 1924, it was 5.68 million 石, and by 1933, it had become 8.36 million 石. Japan also transplanted its own rice varieties to Taiwan to improve them, which is the so-called "蓬萊米 [péng lái mǐ - Ponlai rice]". Japan also regards Fujian as its sphere of influence, so the Japanese government's dumping of Taiwanese rice in Fujian and Guangdong is easy to handle and can be expected to succeed.</p>
<p>Judging from the above situation, except for the Yangtze River basin, which is difficult to win at the moment, South China and North China can be sure. Some say that the price of Japanese rice is high, and selling it in China will inevitably lead to losses. This view is correct in ordinary times, but not in extraordinary times. Japanese rice is currently in an extraordinary period. If surplus rice is not sold, there is no other way. Willingness to accept losses is already in the Japanese government's budget. Even if it is transported to the Yangtze River area and various commercial ports in North China, the losses will be borne by the Japanese government. The losses from dumping Taiwanese rice will be filled by the Taiwanese people and the Taiwanese government equally. Its determination to do it is already conceivable. Moreover, the reason why rice prices in Japan are higher than in China is also because its capacity is larger than ours. Our country now calculates in 公石 [gōng shí - hectoliters] (巿石 [shì shí - market 石] is the same amount). One 石 of Japanese rice is approximately equal to one hectoliter and eight 公斗 [gōng dǒu - decaliters] and a little more. Even if the Shanghai rice price is eight yuan per hectoliter, the price of one 石 of Japanese rice should be fourteen yuan and forty cents. At 112 合 [hé - combined with] Japanese currency, it is sixteen yuan and one dime and change. The quality of Japanese rice is also better than Japonica rice, so the high rice price in Shanghai means that Japanese rice has the possibility of dumping. Moreover, since it is said to be dumping, only selling is desired, and other things are not considered.</p>
<p>Some say that since foreign rice is taxed, foreign rice has long disappeared in Shanghai. Even if Japanese rice is imported, it will be difficult to compete with local rice. I don't know that Fujian and Guangdong provinces have long been excluded. Even if Fujian and Guangdong impose taxes and the Shanghai and Tianjin customs impose taxes, the Japanese can still use their special power to find ways to avoid it. Even if not, they will definitely be able to avoid the heavy and take the light. Don't you see that Japanese goods with very heavy tariffs can still be imported into China with their subtle transportation techniques and still dominate? Since the dumping of Japanese rice is presided over by the government, it will inevitably use all its strength to achieve it. Tariffs cannot prevent it from coming, how can the people resist its import? The arrival of Japanese rice is just around the corner. Let's see what happens later. (Table lengthy, omitted)</p>

<p>Extension of Silver and Money Industry Collection and Settlement Time</p>
<h3 id="e283">│Collection of Bills Until 4 PM│ <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>The silver and money industry's custom is that every lunar new year's end, they engage in summarizing the year's accounts. This time it is also the lunar year's end. All interactions with various parties must be summarized. Therefore, the procedures are vast, and the fixed period is insufficient for work. Therefore, it was decided that from yesterday (the 8th), the time would be extended. Bill collection ends at 4 PM, and organization ends at 10 PM. Therefore, all routine spare time settlement news, due to time constraints, cannot be calculated as usual. In the market, the interbank overnight rate remained at 2%, the same in the morning and afternoon. Clearing house transactions were initially white, then done at 2-3%. For bill transactions, morning market transfers were 1.3-1.4 million, new transactions were over 400,000, afternoon market transactions were over 300,000, and transactions in the small general association were over 200,000. Transactions for redemption of pawned foreign currency were 400,000-500,000, with 300,000-400,000 in new transactions. The collection and settlement of foreign public orders by money shops was also extended in time, and the organization was later, so it cannot be verified in detail. It was approximately between 30-40 million. The collection and settlement of foreign clearing house funds was about 5-6 million, various exchange rates were over 400,000, banknotes recovered were over 500,000, issued were over 700,000, and customer routing withdrawal was 700,000. Also, the total exchange amount of the Shanghai Bill Exchange on the 8th was 9,223,519.07 silver dollars, including 4,160,858.72 silver dollars and 5,062,660.35 silver dollars for exchange drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars were 847 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Transactions were made, with 9,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market.

<h3 id="e285">Only Swap Transactions <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>Slightly Adorned the Government Bond Market</p>
<p>Few People Attended the Meeting and the Transaction Volume Was Small</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although there was slight activity from major players in the market, the price support was very strong, so the trend remained unchanged. As the end of the year approaches, transactions were sparse. Most were swap transactions. The number of people attending the market was already small, and most were preparing for the New Year. The face situation, so there was nothing to say. At the opening in the morning, the selling of No. 43 was quite strong. Although there was slight buying of No. 50, the supply still exceeded demand, and the market price was slightly lower by 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the second round, there were also swap transactions by bulls, and there was also slight selling of No. 4, and the trend continued to weaken. There was still demand for No. 50, and the market price continued to decrease by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Afterwards, the buying of No. 37 was more enthusiastic, and from the salt tax onwards, it turned from weak to strong, slightly better by 0.05-0.3 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, No. 50 continued to be in demand, and the opening immediately strengthened, mostly recovering by 0.2-0.3 yuan, but the salt tax turned weak again, decreasing by 0.05-0.2 yuan. The closing was even more chaotic, with highs and lows alternating, not exceeding 0.1-0.2 yuan. As a result, the market price was down by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.3-0.4 yuan. However, the current month's 19 customs duty bond alone rose by 0.1 yuan. Today is the last day of the lunar year, and there will probably not be much fluctuation. The total transaction volume was 11,013,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods, 3,785,000 in futures taxes, 1,100,000 in troop reduction bonds, 870,000 in 19 customs duty bonds, 1,715,000 in 20-volume 20-customs duty bonds, 1,360,000 in gold short-term bonds, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3 id="e286">The First Major Reaction in the New York Stock Market <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm's 7th Report: The New York stock market declined, the first major reaction of 1934. Because of the continuous rise in recent days, the technical position was inevitably weak. Now that the bill to regulate the exchange is under discussion, the situation in France is uncertain, and many bulls are selling off in large quantities, the market has started to decline. Small speculators were forced to sell out completely. Utility stocks were hit the hardest, but gold and silver stocks remained firm throughout the day. Bonds were mixed and slightly weak. Looking at the recent situation, it may temporarily hover. The total daily transaction volume was 4.5 million shares. "Wheat" fell due to slight rain in the southwest, restrictions on the revival of France, and general pessimism. If there is no rain, it seems it will rise again. "Cotton" fell because it was rumored that the Punk-Hay Agreement would not be implemented this year, and many bulls closed their positions. People still had confidence in automatic acreage reduction. The news of the riots in Paris and the reactions in other markets caused the market situation to shake amidst brisk trading. Domestic and foreign countries continued to buy, and spot goods were tight and firm. The Dow Jones index is listed below. Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>

<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, but the situation remained strong. Because a certain factory continued to buy, the rising trend was still strong. This purchase by a certain major player was partly related to the replacement of new standards. Secondly, as American cotton trended higher and raw materials became more expensive, how could the yarn market be weak alone? Once the buying trend started, followers also came enthusiastically.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Man Brand forward market, the rising trend became more intense due to the purchase by a major player at the market price, with each month rising by 0.5, 0.9, and 1.2 yuan. In the afternoon, profit-takers closed their positions, and the market plate loosened slightly, with each month falling by 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 57,800 bales. Heng Da sold 2,300 bales, Tong Fu 3,350 bales, Tong Ji 1,700 bales, Geng Feng 3,650 bales, Chang Ji 1,850 bales, Fu Da 1,950 bales, Yuan De 1,100 bales, Heng De 1,150 bales, and Tong Xing 1,800 bales.

<p>Current yarn sales are more sluggish than before. A total of 425 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. In addition to a price increase of one yuan, the Xin Xin Factory opened with a price of 183.5 to 4 yuan for 20-count Ren Zhong yarn, with a total of 1,300 bales available.

<p>There is a saying that it will be implemented on the 19th</p>
<p>The recent yarn price increase is not unrelated</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of reforming standards at the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange, it is rumored that a decision was made at a meeting the day before yesterday, and it is likely that Golden Rooster yarn will be adopted as the standard. It is scheduled to open for business on February 19th with the May, June, and July terms, a total of three months, all together. According to market rumors, the surge in cotton yarn in the past two days was due to the impact of rising cotton prices, but it was also related to the change in standards. Because a certain factory's ordinary products are 7 yuan lower than the Golden Rooster yarn grade, for future business relations, it plans to buy back all 17,000 to 18,000 bales of cotton yarn in this warehouse at an unlimited price. Also, with the lunar year coming to an end, scattered shorts were greatly affected. It is said that a certain factory purchased about 10,000 to 14,000 bales in the past two days, and the market price rose by 5-6 yuan compared to before. However, whether there will be changes in the future remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The cotton market remained firm. As Indian and American cotton continued to rise and the exchange rate did not change much, the calculated price of foreign cotton rose higher. Speculators' buying intentions were even stronger, and all overseas news was favorable to the bulls. Therefore, the idea of looking high became even stronger. Although Yuan Da sold on rallies, the multi-party absorption was also strong and failed to curb the rising trend.</p>

<p>The Zheng Brand forward market opened flat. When it was auctioned to the second or third round, speculators absorbed it in large quantities, and the closing price rose by another 0.1-0.2 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market situation initially rose due to foreign merchants' buying, then weakened due to the Wall Street weakness, and finally strengthened again due to short covering. As a result, spot goods rose by 10 points per pound, and futures rose by 5 to 12 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot goods rose by 14 points, and futures rose by 90 points. The Egyptian cotton market spot goods rose by 25 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to speculation and purchases by Japanese merchants, then slightly retreated due to the closing of some bulls and the weakness of the US dollar. The closing market situation was firm and stable. As a result, Pingar rose by 3 rupees and 0.125, Oomra rose by 4 rupees and 0.25, and Bailuo Creek rose by 5.5 rupees.

<p>Yesterday the Factories Sold Together</p>
<p>The Market Once Collapsed</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month showed a consistent decline. As the quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago fell by 0.7-0.8 yuan, Canada fell by about 0.15 yuan, and the government continued to sell wheat and factories had already taken it in. In this environment, people could not hold back. At the opening price, the market's fall was still small. Later, as large and small factories sold together, the market collapsed. Until the opening in the afternoon, the market generally hovered. This month, Fu Feng sold, and in the forward market, Fu Xin released files. However, all transactions were price-limited, so the market was stable. As for this month's flour, Fu Feng took according to the draw, and the rest were according to the standard or added or removed, without consistency. As a result, February and March fell by 0.015 yuan, April fell by 0.0175 yuan, May and June fell by 0.02 yuan, and July fell by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<p>The Flour Exchange will be closed for the Spring Festival holiday from today until the 18th. Trading will resume on the 19th, with only the morning market trading six rounds. Full-day business will resume from the 24th.</p>
<p>The Rice Market Has Ended</p>
<h3 id="e296">│Few Transactions and Waiting for Red Plate│ <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from each gang was about ten or twenty boats, but only ten were sampled for sale. The rest planned to trade again during the lunar red plate, so the market situation was extremely quiet. The overall situation has ended. If the Su-Tong gang has already ended, only the Qingjiao Xilian and other late rice, and the North Sea gang packed and paid seven or eight hundred bags, as well as a small amount of Nangang early rice and Changbang Zhongguan goods, are the route for this street, without much fluctuation. Yin Bian Yuan fell by over a jiao due to the approaching end. Inventory such as Hou Geng rely on ten loads, late rice three or four loads, and each variety two or three loads, waiting for the fortune of the red plate.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten boats of goods arrived at the port from He Xia. Because the lunar year is ending and all items are about to end, the shops are gradually closing. The market's sales of various goods are normal. The market's white japonica high-quality goods are flat and weak, and the medium and sub-quality goods show a slight firmness. The other colors are the same as before.</p>

<p>Overseas Silk Sales Have Undergone a Turnaround</p>
<p>(Wuxi Silk Factory Preparing to Resume Work) Wuxi has always been a famous silk-producing area in our country. There are a total of 50 silk factories in the entire county. For years, silk sales in Europe and America have been in a slump, and the silk industry has collapsed. All factories were closed before the lunar New Year's Eve last year. Since the beginning of the year, only six or seven factories have been working reluctantly. Now that overseas silk sales have gradually turned around, the closed factories are resuming work one after another. As of the day before yesterday, there were 12 silk factories in the entire county that had started work, including Yongtai, Jinji, Huaxin, and Zhenyi. More than a dozen other factories are preparing to continue starting work during the lunar New Year.</p>
<p>(Factory Raw Silk 63 Bales Shipped to Lake) The Huangbai factory raw silk purchased by various silk merchants in Shanghai in the Lake area is now being shipped back one after another to meet the needs of the machines. Yesterday, another 63 bales of white factory raw silk were shipped to Huxun.</p>
<p>(Factory Raw Silk Spot Silk Sales Still Smooth) As overseas silk sales are improving day by day, the domestic silk factories are still eager to buy Huangbai factory raw silk. The trend continues to take the opportunity to buy. Yesterday, various silk merchants from Hangzhou, Lake, and Shanghai continued to purchase 90 bales of Grade B Huangbai factory raw silk, and the price continued to rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 3,400 bundles of Japanese lead wire arrived, unloaded at Huifeng Warehouse. It is heard that various companies in this port have purchased it. The market price of Western goods has been greatly affected. It is found that there are still more than 4,000 bundles that can be imported. The varieties are 10, 12, 14, and 16 to 25.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,000 boxes of 180-pound German tinplate were ordered at 31 shillings per box, 6 pence higher than before. Because the imported prices of British and American goods are expensive, no companies have purchased them.</p>

<p>Free Talk Essays Heyezi</p>
<p>In recent years, it can be said that the era of essays is prevalent. Because of its prevalence, many people study it, and there are various conclusions. Of course, there are people who look down on it. Needless to say, they must be good at writing long essays. Wang Chong of the Han Dynasty wrote "Lunheng" in eighty-five chapters, which can be called a large book. The wording of each chapter is also very tight and rich. In his "Zi Ji," he said: "Few words without much, and no few gorgeous writings. Those that are used by the world, a hundred chapters are harmless; those that are not used, one chapter is useless. If all are used, then the more is superior, and the less is inferior. Accumulating a thousand gold is compared to one hundred, who is richer? It can be said that many articles are better than few, and few wealth becomes poorer. The world has no one volume, but I have a hundred chapters; people have no one word, but I have ten thousand words, who is the wiser?" These few words have already judged the merits of long essays and short essays. Today's critics can really quote them.</p>
<p>However, Wang Chong is speaking from the author's standpoint. All authors always like more works and longer articles, because this can prove the greatness of his talent and the depth of his knowledge, just like "accumulating a thousand gold" can show off wealth. However, in terms of purpose, wasting a thousand gold is not necessarily better than making good use of a hundred gold. Similarly, a long and verbose article is not necessarily better than a short essay. When a doctor bought a donkey, the contract was three pages long, but the word "donkey" was nowhere to be found, which was spread as a joke, which shows that long articles also have times when they are useless. And essays sometimes have great effects.</p>
<p>I can give an example. A few days ago, there was such a news item in the newspaper:</p>
<p>"Guangdong Province is unusually cold this winter. The harvest of sweet potatoes and other crops has been greatly damaged. On the roads, there are starving people without winter clothes, who feel great pain. Guangzhou has even had snowfall, which is a rare occurrence. Luofu Mountain now has several inches of accumulated snow, and the scenery is particularly beautiful."</p>
<p>Although this is only sixty or so words, it very clearly and naturally points out the contradictions of modern society: in the same winter, some people feel pain because they have no winter clothes, while others feel that the "scenery is particularly beautiful" because of the several inches of accumulated snow. At the same time, it also points out that a certain type of people in modern times have two souls, one soul that makes him see the suffering of the starving, and another soul that makes him turn around to appreciate the snow scene. But this is not an intentional propaganda by socialists, but merely a factual account by a journalist. He wrote these sixty or so words only to faithfully report a piece of news, not to intentionally criticize society. However, unintentionally, the truth of this society was clearly exposed by him.</p>
<p>If a great writer with great talent were to write a long and verbose article of ten thousand words about the injustices of modern society, I think the effect on the reader would not necessarily be greater than those sixty or so words. Moreover, we often see many articles that, because they have to be long, say this and that in a roundabout way, but unconsciously say things that contradict each other, making it impossible for the reader to see what is going on.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that the quality of an article really has nothing to do with its length. Wang Chong's words should be changed to "Those that are used by the world, one chapter is harmless. Those that are not used, a hundred chapters are useless."</p>
<p>Is Tao Gong a Farmer? Guyun</p>
<p>I casually talked about Tao Yuanming last time because I read an article by Mr. Cao Juren. Yesterday I read Free Talk on February 5th, and I was honored by Mr. Cao's reply and was rudely referred to as a member of the "Tao Party". Junfang's language is wonderful in the world, and I can't help but fear that it will hinder the handsome. I am very grateful for Mr. Cao's meaning. Whenever something raises a question, it must be proven by supporting evidence. Tao Gong has been dead for many years. Mr. Cao said that he "does not associate with farmers": and I said that he is a "farmer who can write poetry". To determine this case, we must "throw the book bag". But my book box is all in the north. I am ashamed to say that I don't have a single book in my Shanghai residence. If I want to run to a very far library to search, I had this "phlegm" ten years ago, but now my spine has been broken by life, and I am no longer allowed to be so elegant. Today, I borrowed three incomplete collections of Tao's works from a friend and wrote this first draft to consult Mr. Cao. I am afraid there are many mistakes. Because I have no books at hand, it is like having no weapons in the army, and I dare not fight this battle. If I can throw a brick to attract jade because of my humble words, and another learned gentleman is willing to talk about it, then I will shrink back and consider it a special honor.</p>
<p>Now, I will interpret Mr. Cao's reply and express my extended words:</p>
<p>I slightly quoted Tao's poems in my previous article as evidence that Tao Gong cultivated the land himself. Mr. Cao answered in his article by discussing the world and knowing people, talking about the social chaos of the Eastern Jin Dynasty and the desolation of the countryside, and deeply wondered why Tao's poems ignored the dark shadows of the countryside. That's right. But this cannot be used to prove that Tao was not a farmer. The dark shadows of the Chinese countryside are even worse than those of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Almost all of today's farmers do not understand the countryside. However, they are still farmers even if they become farmers. What distinguishes Tao Gong from ordinary farmers is that he is a farmer who is a Confucian poet. He is a person who only cares about his own moral cultivation. It is true that he ignores the widespread dark shadows of the countryside. Because besides Confucian thought, everything else about him is the same as ordinary farmers. He did not open his eyes to make a general expression of the countryside. But the poverty and hardship he described in his poems and articles are precisely a concrete corner of the countryside, which is not inconsistent with Mr. Cao's discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding Tao's drinking and traveling, I said in my previous article that they were rest after labor.</p>
<p>His dream of the Peach Blossom Spring is enough to explain him. "They go back and forth to plant and cultivate, and the clothes of men and women are all like those of outsiders. Old people with white hair and children with their hair in tufts are all happily enjoying themselves... They say that their ancestors fled from the chaos of the Qin Dynasty and led their wives, children, and villagers to this isolated place."</p>
<p>"Mulberry trees and bamboos cast their remaining shadows, and soybeans and millet are planted in season. Spring silkworms gather long silk, and the autumn harvest is exempt from royal taxes." This is Tao's "ivory tower". And I secretly believe that this is precisely a painful reflection of a good farmer under the harsh government in troubled times. After the pain, he dreamed of this "isolated place" that was "exempt from royal taxes". Tao Gong never lived in the "ivory tower" for a single day in his life.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao mentioned at the end of his article that the people of Wuhan were fish the year before last, and some people were floating in boats on moonlit nights, flirting with prostitutes and singing songs. His words are extremely painful. Mr. Cao made this statement because he was moved by this world. My sadness and Mr. Cao's are exactly the same. And I believe that if Tao Gong were still alive, he would definitely hate it deeply. Because Tao Gong suffered more than Mr. Cao and I. There is no exception to what Tao feels for what we are saddened about.</p>
<p>Now, please follow the root. Was Tao Yuanming a farmer after all?</p>
<p>Of course, Tao Yuanming was not a farmer from birth, but he made up his mind to "transform" (please forgive me for using this fashionable word) into a farmer after he resigned from his post. He remained so until his death.昭明序陶集 has "...贞志不休，安道苦节。不以躬耕为耻，不以无财为病"之言，而其为陶作传亦云，“……亲老家贫，起为州祭酒。不堪吏职，少日自解归。州召主簿，不就。躬耕自资，遂抱赢疾……"顏延年靖節徵士誄 has "...於是乎遂灌畦鬻蔬，爲供魚菽之祭；織絇緯蕭，以充糧粒之費". However, these words from others can only be used as collateral evidence.</p>
<p>Let's seek direct evidence from Tao Gong himself.祭從弟敬遠文 has "…每忆有秋，我将其刈。"自祭文 has "自余为人，逢运之贫。箪瓢屡罄，絺綌冬陈。含欢谷汲，行歌负薪。翳翳柴门，事我宵晨。春秋代谢，有务中园。载耘载耔，乃育廼繁。欣以素牍，和以七絃。冬曝其日，夏濯其泉。勤靡余劳心有长闲" "有会而作" has "旧谷既没，新谷未登。颇为老农，而值年灾。日月尚悠，为患未已。…" These are all portrayals of his own life. In his poem "Diligent Farming," he cites Shun, Yu, Ji Que, Ju Ni, and other sages who still cultivated the land themselves, and tells everyone not to "drag their robes and stand with their hands clasped." He tells everyone to be diligent and not to enjoy ease. This can be regarded as his theory.归田园居 has "…种苗在东 畴，苗生满阡陌。虽有荷锄倦，浊酒聊自适" and刘柴桑 has "…茅茨已就治，新畴复应畬。" Let's look at the titles of two more poems: one is "Gengxu Year, Ninth Month, Harvesting Armor in the West Field," and the other is "Bingchen Year, Eighth Month, Harvesting in the Lower Xun Field House." These two poems further detail his own hard work in farming, and a kind of joy of diligent harvest is not easy to imitate. This is the realization of his theory.</p>
<p>The correct words have been spoken. Please go one step further and ask why Tao Gong, as a farmer, ate so much bitterness and was a man of outstanding thought, ignored the dark shadows of the rural areas at that time? I said in the previous article that Tao Gong used Confucian thought. There are many categories of Confucianism. Tao Gong used the most basic narrow road of Confucianism. Liang Rengong once argued that Tao Gong was a kind of person that Confucius called "robbers". In his later years, his meritorious deeds were fulfilled and he had the joy of self-satisfaction. (I remember that Liang's book "Tao Yuanming" published by the Commercial Press had this saying.) I sympathize with Rengong's statement. He is the most upright person. The characteristic of this kind of person is that the scope is often not easy to broaden. He is poor and works hard. Tan Daoji sent him Liang Rou, even when he was hungry and upset, he would not bother to take a look. Yan Yanzhi is an old friend and sent him 20,000 yuan. Okay, accept it. You can take it to buy wine and have fun. But he will never take it to use as his own. Among the dirty gentry at that time, he stubbornly acted as an iron man who did not follow the customs and only cared about his own moral cultivation. In order to achieve this goal of personal independence │ what he himself said he did not ask for │ he used farming as a means to achieve this goal. He broke through all the sieges of hunger, cold, and hardship, and finally he gained the pleasure of personal independence. He devoted all his energy to this. Therefore, he is ultimately a person who only cares about his own moral cultivation. Therefore, it is not surprising that he ignores the general rural phenomena.</p>
<p>Whether people in the present era still want to be a person exactly like Yuanming is another question. Most people with clear minds are probably unwilling to advocate a person who is exactly like Tao. We return Tao Yuanming to Tao Yuanming, then Yuanming seems to be like this.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you Mr. Cao for your kind reply!</p>
<p>In Singapore</p>
<p>Black Baby Singapore! Paris on the Equator.</p>
<p>I jumped ashore, raised my head, and a skyscraper stood before my eyes. I looked up layer by layer along the honeycomb-like windows; the flag of the Great British Empire was inserted on the top of the skyscraper!</p>
<p>Trolleybuses, cars, motorcycles, ... came and went horizontally and vertically, echoing metallic noises in my ears.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers were shouting. -- These poor rickshaw pullers who have been forgotten by the motherland! Wearing tattered hats, half-naked, sweat pouring straight down their foreheads, their skin aching from the scorching sun: but who cares?</p>
<p>Indian police officers were waving wooden sticks behind them. Rickshaw pullers are often beaten: in people's eyes, they seem to no longer be human beings.</p>
<p>The Ningbo people who raised the "T"-shaped hoes were all black and panting. They hoed the asphalt road again and again. The cars brushed past them, whooshing, and a burst of thick smoke sprayed out from their butts, with a smell of oil.</p>
<p>I was pulled by a rickshaw to live in "Nantian". In the desert-like equator, Singapore really cannot but be regarded as Paris. Look!</p>
<p>Skyscrapers. The magnificent General Post Office. Banks. ...</p>
<p>The famous Oriental cinema Capital. New World Amusement Park. Nantian Grand Restaurant. ...</p>
<p>Imperialism has invaded here for quite some time. The black smoke from the factories rises straight up all day long. However, with the economic panic becoming more and more severe, Singapore naturally has no way to prosper.</p>
<p>I saw so many empty shops, so many unemployed workers. I also saw Indian police officers grabbing petty thieves and beating them. At night, when the lights of the New World are shining brightly, there are countless hungry people suffering from hunger and cold in front of the doors of empty shops. They have no warm quilts, no money, no home! ...</p>
<p>God, what can I say?</p>
<p>I'm just a passerby!</p>
<p>Dance halls have also been opened in Singapore. Society is contradictory after all; on the one hand, some people are starving, while on the other hand, some people are drinking champagne and dancing.</p>
<p>"Who cares, I'll go dancing while I still have money today!"</p>
<p>A friend of mine said that.</p>
<p>So the revelry of jazz music leaked faintly from the magnificent dance hall, and two or three beggars were waiting anxiously outside the door. When the gentlemen came, they chased after them:</p>
<p>"Do a good deed..."</p>
<p>Before they could finish speaking, they had already run inside.</p>
<p>I wandered around here for a while and finally left.</p>
<p>I left Singapore on a drizzly evening. With a whoosh, the ship moved step by step. I was alone on the deck, looking at the dense lights, the shadows of the skyscrapers, as if thousands of sharp arrows were inserted into my heart.</p>
<p>I couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>I'm just a passerby!</p>
<p>I Curse That Smile of Yours (2) Wu Yan</p>
<p>"Going to the barbarian land? That's dangerous, no one will come back."</p>
<p>Naturally, I had to get to the bottom of the matter, and the answer was:</p>
<p>"Why do you say that? You'll be caught by the women there!"</p>
<p>The meaning is that in the area bordering Myanmar and Siam, there are some barbarians whose women are more beautiful than Han Chinese girls and are more likely to tempt people. Although the words are a bit too much, the meaning is partly correct.</p>
<p>These Yi women who come down to the valley to spend the night mostly -- it seems almost as a rule -- come to our shop first. Only when it's really full do they go to Old Liu's shop. Few go to the other shops. This is not because our inn treats guests with special humility or charges less. The reason is that the proprietress of our shop and her eldest daughter can both speak three languages, and can be said to be the two linguistic giants in this small valley. The proprietress learned the local savage language here, and at the same time, because she was born to a Han Chinese father and an Yi mother, she was naturally very proficient in both Han Chinese and Yi languages. Her eldest daughter, on the other hand, should be regarded as her mother's proud disciple in the course of linguistics. Therefore, those Yi women who come from afar are happy to come and stay overnight for the convenience of speaking and also to get the friendly greetings of the female owner of the same ethnic group.</p>
<p>As for Old Liu's shop, his woman is a savage woman who can speak some Yi language, but is not very proficient. However, compared to those inns where no one understands even Yi language, she can be regarded as a diplomatic talent, without being deficient in any way. Therefore, the Yi people who cannot stay in our shop are also willing to stay overnight.</p>
<p>The owners of other inns, because they lack this kind of diplomatic linguistic talent, their business is naturally much inferior, and they often scratch their heads and express such envious words to these two shops, especially our shop:</p>
<p>"Well, it would be great if I had such a wife!"</p>
<p>"Even half would be fine, ... like Old Liu's!"</p>
<p>My boss, on the other hand, is also very complacent, thinking that with such a wife as the foreign minister and such a daughter as the assistant, he can simply be called king in this small valley. No matter what country's envoys (travelers of various races) come to pay tribute (stay overnight) and offer tribute (pay the bill), he does not feel any diplomatic difficulties at all.</p>
<p>But once, a guest who came to buy goods actually caused a bit of an interesting incident in diplomacy because of the language communication.</p>
<p>Could it be that the person who came was a deaf-mute person? No, he is still proficient in three languages. Don't you think this is very interesting?</p>
<p>This person also lives in the valley, and specializes in managing the construction of roads in the mountains. If a section of the mountain road is suddenly washed away by a mountain flood, and the camel and horse caravans going from Bamou to Tengyue cannot pass, then the British authorities in Bamou will send someone to investigate and blame him. He is an Indian who understands Burmese and English. But when he calls on the savages to come down the mountain to repair the road, he must first find a savage who can speak Burmese to be the foreman.</p>

<p>Shenbao Local Supplement: Talk About Shanghai Qiongsheng</p>
<p>At the end of 1929, due to the bankruptcy of the New York Stock Exchange, the world economic crisis that erupted quickly stirred up the entire world. Wherever it reached, industrial and commercial closures, bank bankruptcies, rural economic destruction, and the deterioration of the lives of the working class and farmers, unemployment and starvation became inevitable and already occurring phenomena. Considering the situation in our country in recent years, the "decline of all industries" and "rural bankruptcy" have long been problems that people in power, politicians, and economists have been anxious about and unable to solve. Worker unemployment, farmer crop failures and disasters, and even bumper harvests become disasters. As a result, banditry prevails and society is in turmoil. All of these are due in part to the world economic crisis, which seems to be an "undeniable" fact. However, in the wave of China's overall economic bankruptcy years ago, Shanghai was the only port that could stand alone and create a new situation. Under the coercion of "recession," it still maintained "prosperity," which was truly unique. Indeed, Shanghai's population growth, the construction of many large buildings, the development of the banking industry, the sharp rise in land prices, and the increase in rents all seem to indicate the prosperity of this "international market" and show signs of great "prosperity." This phenomenon of "prosperity" has made some people who have made money in the interior, "with ten million strings of cash around their waists, riding cranes to Yangzhou," come to this "ten-mile foreign market" as "retired gentlemen." Amidst the cries of ruin and desolation, supplemented by the joyful voices of "Shanghai's prosperity," it has also led many romantic and optimistic gentlemen, regardless of how the world is feeling the shock of the "crisis," to forget themselves and make countless "Greater Shanghai Construction Plans" and "work hard" to build "Greater Shanghai."</p>
<p>However, this cheer of "Shanghai's prosperity" is more悲傷 to me than hearing the funeral song of the pastor sending the dead to the grave, and this effort to build "Greater Shanghai" is more心痛 than seeing the gravedigger working hard to bury the carcass that has lost its "soul." Shanghai's prosperity, instead of being praised as the development of China's industry and commerce, should be said to be the collection of the blood shed by the people of the whole country for several years. Instead of considering it as the "consolidation" of China's financial economy, it is better to regard it as the expansion of the suction tube of imperialism that squeezes the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. Because after the world economic crisis swept China, Shanghai was still able to maintain its "prosperity" on the surface, not because Shanghai, this "economic center," was able to turn the tide and become a "pillar in the torrent," but in reality, it contained the following three meanings:</p>
<p>First, the world economic crisis caused by the existence of the world capitalist system has made the excess products and surplus capital of various powers, under the situation where imperialists and their vassals are shouting "closed-door economy" and "economic war" and implementing "tariff barriers," have nowhere to sell and nowhere to invest before using a big war to "redivide the world." Of course, our country, with its "open door and equal opportunity," has become a target for dumping foreign goods and foreign capital. And Shanghai, this gateway to the coast and the interior and the "metropolis of the East," has become the focus of various countries' invasion of the Chinese market. This kind of "prosperity" is undoubtedly the tomb of China's industry and the consolidation of imperialist power.</p>
<p>Second, years of civil war and natural and man-made disasters, after "destroying" the "production" of the rural economy, drove many wealthy families and hungry groups from the countryside to the city to seek a happy land and find work. Therefore, Shanghai's "prosperity" has only increased many "retired gentlemen," resulting in higher rents, sharp rises in land prices, and countless unemployed, idlers, bandits, and beggars. This kind of "prosperity" is a reflection of China's economic bankruptcy and the people's poverty.</p>
<p>Third, the construction of the so-called "Greater Shanghai Plan," in addition to the fact that this "strong outside and weak inside" "prosperity" will inevitably turn it into a fantasy, will undoubtedly only create speculators such as real estate tycoons and landlords who are of no help to industry, and "work hard" to consolidate the "international market" of the powers.</p>
<p>However, no matter how the "Greater Shanghai Construction Plan" "works hard," after a period of "prosperity," the cry of "the decline of Greater Shanghai" has now begun. According to recent reports, "This port is not only the largest commercial market in the Far East, but also the political, economic, industrial, and commercial center of the country. For years, various places have been plagued by civil wars and natural and man-made disasters... Only Shanghai has not been affected... Only in recent years, due to the intrusion of foreign goods, the domestic economy has been exhausted, and recently the recession has become more severe, with imports exceeding 700 million." After this painful narrative, it is described that at the end of the lunar year, there is a rumor that 500 large businesses have gone bankrupt, and Nanjing Road, which is similar to the Tokyo Ginza and New York Wall Street, has more than 50% of its stores in debt. The Shanghai Special District Local Court has received more than half of the lawsuits accusing Nanjing Road merchants, and the seals cannot be issued according to legal procedures. This fact is where Shanghai's "prosperity" lies, and also where the "Greater Shanghai Plan" lies! "The decline of Greater Shanghai," "the decline of Greater Shanghai." If anyone has unspeakable feelings of nostalgia and cherishing the old for this "decline" caused by an unsound system, there is no way but to offer condolences to him.</p>
<p>Mother and Son Boer</p>
<p>It's a pity that his little soul lives with his young mother in the severe cold and snow.</p>
<p>"Living is really not easy, and you still want to cry!" His mother said in a deep and resentful voice.</p>
<p>"Aiyo... Aiyo... Aiyo" The child, who was not yet two years old, did not understand his mother's depression, and he cried and cried. His mother knew that he was hungry, but what could she do to make him stop crying and not be hungry? She got up at six o'clock in the morning and ran around until now. Everyone else had eaten their lunch, and she had only borrowed two small coins from Mingyou. No wonder he was crying. The mother had to comfort him and say, "You little animal, go to sleep. When you wake up, you'll have food to eat!" He cried so tired that he fell asleep in his mother's arms. The mother did not dare to put him on the bed, fearing that he would be cold and also fearing that he would wake up. So, she held him with one hand and cooked with the other. In such cold weather, she closed the door and lit the most economical coal briquette stove in Shanghai, which could cook food and at the same time let the child get some warmth.</p>
<p>The mother thought he must be sleeping very comfortably, but who knew that he suddenly jumped up from her arms, and the tone of his crying was different from usual, as if he was frightened. She thought the child might be having a nightmare and patiently patted him to go back to sleep. Before the rice was cooked, he had cried like this several times. His hands and feet were constantly dancing, and the mother was very impatient. She thought he would be quiet if she gave him food, but who knew that this time it was not like this. He did not want to eat, he wanted to cry, wanted to jump up and sit up, but he also wanted to go to sleep. He could not settle down and was very tired. His vermilion lips suddenly turned as white as snow at this time. She saw that this situation was not good, so she picked him up and paced around the room, rocking him and singing to him. In an instant, she did not know what was going on, but she felt as if she could not stand up, her feet were soft, her head was heavy, her eyes were blurry, and she felt like she was going</p>
