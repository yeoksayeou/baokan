<p>十五年來遷廷不決之薩爾問題。最距離公民投票之時期日益接近。復驟趨惡化。而引起世界人士莫大之焦慮。據法國外交部之所表示。附近薩爾之法軍早有完密準備。隨時可以出發。如德國國社黨實行以強硬手腕。貫澈其歸土運動之初衷。則法軍決不惜斷然處置。開大薩爾境內。維持條約之權利。猶憶二閱月前。美國前任駐波蘭大使皮爾森氏考察歐洲歸國。報告羅斯福總統。略謂薩爾問題。較諸其他歐洲問題更爲嚴重。公民投票一事。含有潛伏之危機。不容漢視云云。德法兩國茍不幸而爲此問題各走極端。則結果所釀成之禍忠。誠有不堪設想者。</p>
<p>自凡爾賽和約成立後。薩爾礦區即由國聯行政院設立行政委員會管理之。原定限期十五年。期滿舉行公民投票。以便決定該地應否維持現狀。或歸併於德或法。依此規定。公民投票將於一九三五年問舉行。而其的期則由國聯行政院議決之。本年六月三日。法德意三國代表經反覆商酌的之結果。決以凡爾賽和約所規定之最早日期（即一九三五年一月十三日）爲投票日。并經行政院正式通過。然現因選民資格被提出異議者。達十萬至十三萬人之多。一一加以審查。需時甚久。預料在最後限期十一月九日以前。不能竣事。故投票日期。勢必展緩。九日之最後期限。轉瞬即屆。投票展緩之議。無可倖免。夫希特勒夙以無條件收回薩爾爲標枋者也。徒以實力不競。隱忍迄今。然對國聯派駐薩爾之行政委員會。固目爲規法。而屢表不滿。今後投票日期而果至於展緩。自將更予希氏以咀咒國聯之藉口。本年一月十六日路透社日內瓦消息嘗云。當地人士。認爲投票決定展期。則德國方而定有特殊舉動。今觀乎法人嚴重之戒備。頗足證明斯言之不認。</p>
<p>再就薩爾公民之態度立論。將來實行投票之結果。亦正難逆料。此項投票權無男女國籍之差別。凡在投票日期年滿二十歲。並自一九一九年六月二十八日起居住薩爾境內者。可以一律享受。而無所軒輊。然則依照常情觀察。薩爾八十萬人民中既以屬於德國血統者居絕大多數。德國騰利宜可預卜。奚必鰓鰓皇慮。故示人以不廣。不知此事內容複雜。絕不能憑簡單之推測而斷爲定論。薩爾固多社會黨及反希特勒份子。深懼合併之後將危及若輩生命。故寧願維持現狀。而反對在希氏領導下之歸士運動。如境內勢力最大之中央黨及次大之共產黨。皆高張反對希氏之旗幟。而共產黨之態度尤爲堅決。該黨領袖早在本年六月初旬發出佈告。命其全體黨員投票時。一律主張維持現制。此舉對於希氏運動之打擊殊不在小也。</p>
<p>德政府有鑒於此。乃反覆聲明。對於投票人民決不施任何直接或間接之壓力。且不論投票者之態度如何。決不採取報復手段。然中央黨與共產黨。歴經國社黨之摧殘。結怨至深。雖有甘言密語。豈肯遽爾輕信。而況法人居問操縱。曲意聯絡。其影響所及。更非局外人所能知。蓋法人自知。欲求薩爾歸已。希望極微。退就其次。莫如維持現狀。一則可以繼續在薩爾採煤。以供本國之需要。冉則可以限制希特勒氏之政治力量。勿因薩爾問題面牽動歐洲全局也。是以今後薩爾問題之癥結。在於歸還德國抑或維持現狀。維持現狀。既爲法人所主張。則仍不外夫法德之爭。如希特勒在明年公民投票期內。缺乏必操勝利左券之把握。則最近或不免以反對投票延期爲藉口。而企圖其特殊舉動之實現。法人至是。自將以武力裁制而重演出兵魯爾之故事。雙方積不相下。歐洲戰機之醖釀。必將更形成熟。可斷言也。</p>

<h3>海軍談判僵局</h3>
<p>美日會談兩小時</p>
<p>仍是無結果而散</p>
<p>倫敦　英美日之倫敦海軍談話、因日本海軍平等之要求、現處於驚濤駭浪中、三國外交家皆勉力欲得可進行談話之基礎、但據負責美方消息、今日美日代表集護兩小時、未能使關於日本提案之討論稍有進步、會議時曾討論日本總噸數之理想、及其對於自衛與攻人利器之見解、但美代表終未能贊同日方山本等所陳述等及共同高限度之意義、日方謂彼等未有建造軍艦直達共同高限度之意、彼等之所以要求平等者、從菲全爲體面問題、然亦大半爲體面問題云、日方所稱日本島國在太平洋中未與英美同處平等地位一說、美方殊不以爲然、蓋以爲海軍力之強弱、視國家需要而定也、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美方質問深刻</h3>

<h3>日欲自掩其詐</h3>
<p>謂美不放棄進攻遠東政策</p>
<p>東京　軍縮預備交涉、日美兩國之對立漸次進至尖銳化、美國代表圍社已聲言、對於日本之新提案根本不能容納、日本海軍認爲遣憾之極、其見解之大致如下、日美會商、一言以蔽之曰、欲樹立不感脅、不侵略原則之日本主張、美國方面決與之冰炭不相容、而與美國海軍傳統政策之東洋進攻軍戰主義完全處於對立形勢、不問其黑白、已甚明瞭、吾人確信世界之與論亦將漸次對於日本方面表示好感、但美國方面值此時機、標榜其太平洋防禦強化與夫新造艦計劉案、對於軍縮精神瀕作倒行逆施之反宣傳、唯此種情形當係少數分子無理取鬧之行爲、決非美國全體民衆之公意、言念及此、至爲遺憾耳云云、（一日日聯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　日方要求設置根據軍備平等權主張之共通保有量最高限度、與美方要求存在根據相對海軍力主張之華府條約、日方雖表明數字內容、顯難容納、而技術折衝勢已不能接近、故英方一面欲挾助華府條約之成立、而以如限制太平洋防備恊定之前例、何等政治材料、圖謀調和日美間之對立、依會談之現狀觀之、均以爲此乃最適當之方法、唯日方以爲導入政治問題有乖海軍會議之本質、一方復推想、若僅英美日三國、則難免不發生無可限制之問題、故會談前途乃愈益複雜、又就會談之全而言之、山本史坦特萊間之反覆論戰、究以進行非技術方面之恊議爲必要、現三國間對此已意見一致、是堪注目者也、（一日電通社電）</p>

<p>孟買銀市　今日午後五時半銀價漲五安那、此乃投機家援畫所致、開會爲六四羅比、與昨價同、但收盤現貨各跌漲起五安那、而爲六四羅比五安那、</p>

<h3>棉麥</h3>
<p>紐約棉花　南方現棉狀況呆滯、政府明年棉產計畫、現尚未悉、棉市乃受此影響、若千方面估計棉因畝數、至少爲三千四百萬英畝、視前估計爲多、棉市開盤、價格較昨價六七磅音、但因同業收買、價遂穩定、</p>
<p>溫尼偑麥　溫尼佩格雜糧交易所、因政府之請求、今日聲稱、從今日起、十二月期與五月期麥價、皆規定最低限度、十二月期與五月期麥價、皆規定最低限度、十二月期爲七角五分、五月期爲八角、該交易所理事長於宣佈此項最低限價時、謂近來外人繼續在此售出、故不得不有些舉云、但此計畫須施行若干時、則未曾言及、故溫尼偑格與芝加上麥市、今日開盤時、價皆潔起、五月期溫尼佩格漲一磅音二五、芝加張八七五、而阿真廷小麥銹病之續報、亦爲價漲之原因、</p>

<h3>證券</h3>
<p>紐約　證券開盤前、有利於市況之因素、爲一維持證券市塲之主要元素、爲投資買進、此種行動、在現有之環境中、可認爲使人興奮、而不利於市況這因素、則爲一主要物品市塲之不寗、二證券市塲雖稍有向上之趨勢、但未能鼓起投機家之興趣、今晨證券開盤時、市況沈滯、但人氣尚穩、價格微有變動、起落互見、衆紏在此沉悶已久之市塲中、當有少許起色、茲將紐約證券市價列左、</p>

<h3>女青年會募欵大會開幕</h3>

<h3>黃夫人詞</h3>
<p>今日女青年會募欵大會、在市長府上舉行、很爲榮幸、市長及夫人對吾會事業、贊助至啟、深表謝意、又得市長夫人及孔夫人擔任大會會長、婦女界領袖一百五十餘位、擔任隊長隊員、及十五位先生做我們的顧問、都使人感到激勵、希望大家共同努力、達到圓滿的目的、</p>
<h3>孔部長詞</h3>
<p>今日因孔夫人身體不適、不能到會、由鄙人前來加、至覺欣慶、女青年會是領導婦女盡職社會工作的一個團體、事工天天發展、不久便能普遍全國、并且在國際中、已佔有相當地位、此次募欵、能得吳市長幫忙、成功已達一半、又有各界婦女領袖擔任隊長隊員、勝券更可預操、希望不祗能達到目的、更能超過目的、是所欣祝、</p>

<h3>朱友漁詞</h3>

<h3>梁桐芳供述投彈悅來經過</h3>
<p>關於從軍及其他工作均詳陳無遺</p>
<p>投彈目的在乎警告並無傷人之意</p>
<p>龔芳來所開之廣東路悅來南貨店、因被赤血鋤奸團查悉、有私進大批日貨情事、屢次警告、置若罔聞、故於十月十九號、由團員梁桐芳攜帶炸彈炸燬該店、當時除梁自已炸傷外、并傷店夥傳榮生。丁炎生。等數人、事後由該管老閘捕房將傷者分別車送醫院醫治、但梁所受之傷、係在左右二手、因傷重潰瀾、故由醫生將左手指二節及右臂前增段截去醫治迄今、已有旬日、傷勢略痊、捕房乃於三十號將梁由院中提出、於昨晨解送第一特院刑一庭、捕房方面祇請求準予覊押、以便續偵查、并未正式起訴、而梁身穿醫院制服兩手以白布包紥、站於被告欄內、首由捕房律師王耀堂起而陳述經過情形、謂梁前在十九路軍擔任抗日工作、自停戰恊定簽訂後、梁即</p>
<h3>流落滬濱</h3>
<p>後由江海關監督唐海安加以援助、介紹至東亞體專學校讀書、但梁杭日之心、未嘗稍忘、仍繼續工作、調查滬上各商舖有無販賣日貨行爲、自梁被捕後、捕房探員、曾赴東亞體專調查、當在梁之行李內抄出抗日工作之記載、及報紙數份、均有梁之作品、刋登、現梁因甫於前日出院、故捕房尚須加以偵查、有無政治關係、目下并未起訴、查梁於上月十八號與其同志查得悅來南貨店有販賣日貨情事、乃於當晚在鶴鳴旅館六十八號房商議、預備翌日攜彈警告、但捕房往鶴鳴調查、并無六十八號房間、該旅館至高房間號徵爲四十六號、故其所言、殊不可靠、抑或號數錯誤、現請準予改期訊理云云、繼據</p>
<h3>悅來店夥</h3>
<p>傳榮生投稱、二十六歲、南匯人、是日午刻、我正在櫃內營業時、梁即來與我談話、因其所操爲北方口音、故我未能明瞭彼之所言、乃囑同事丁姓與之接談、其時梁即將紙包一個擲於櫃上、哄然一聲、我之手指胸部、均各受傷、現已略愈云云、又據夥友丁炎之提案、證明一過、詰之梁桐芳供稱、悅來南貨店之私進日貨極多、如鮑魚、魚翅、之類、實爲一總批發所、一般較小之南貨店均向彼批發、此事經赤血鋤奸團調查股查悉、屢加警告不理、故於十九日由我攜彈前去、查我前在錦華小錢莊爲夥、自九一八事件發生後、我即投奔馬占山將軍處、參加抗日工作、不久滬埠一二八批發、我即來滬、投入翁照垣旅長所屬之一百五十旅當兵、庶能實地工作、及後</p>
<h3>滬戰停止</h3>
<p>我又被派至無錫第三隊訓練、未幾該隊解散、我乃跟隨上海學生志願團。東北義勇軍出發至關外工作、九門口一役、我等作戰三日夜、飢寒交迫、在積雪數尺中掙扎、後該軍領袖朱子橋將軍見而不忍、因我等均屬南方人士、不慣此種工作、乃調往北平後方、曾隨翁旅長參加抗日工作頗多、及後塘沾恊定成立、我又往新疆等處繼續工作、因該處赤地千里、四無人煙、無法前進、祇得折回、途中曾遇土匪、將我所有衣服等物、悉數刦去、祇剩汗衫一件、襯袴一條、後得該處省主席之援助始能因至北平、又得後援會之接濟、贈我銀洋百餘元、乃添購衣服、於去年十月間</p>
<h3>獨自來滬</h3>
<p>因無工作可做、乃往走訪姚兆里律師、請求覓一苦刀工作、因姚律師之妹、曾與我同爲義勇軍也、姚律師除餽贈洋十元外、並介紹擔包租得黃包車一輛、遂開始拉黃包車之工作、自食其力、亦覺怡然自得、嗣因國事日非、實覺無力挽回、與其將來變作亡國奴、不若此刻死去、反覺乾凈、乃決定自殺、於今歲正月間、曾吞服鴉片一次、結果、經人救愈、後於三月十五號轉入東亞體育讀書、但我自到滬後、即加入赤血鋤奸團、幫助工作、因該團調查股查悉悅來南貨店、有私進大批日貨、預先曾去函兩次、加以警告、供至此、捕房律師起稱、據悅來南貨店、曾向捕房聲明、事前並未接到警告信、祇於出事後之翌日及二十一號接到外界投來信函五封云云、梁乃續稱、此項炸彈、由我從</p>
<h3>東北帶來</h3>
<p>沿途暗藏身畔、未遭查去、因我身雖到滬、但抗日之心未死、預備繼續工作、該彈係漢陽兵工廠所造、實不能炸死人、祇能恐嚇炸傷、故我於十九號午刻、往往悅來時、因其時正屬午膳之際、店堂中及顧客定屬減少、及至櫃旁、先大聲囑店夥進內室、並將紙包撕碎、顯露內有炸彈、此處我之一片好心、因我前去之目的、祇須警告店主、並不欲有所傷人也、但店夥等均屬笨伯、我之上海土白、彼等竟然不懂、其時因炸彈上之保險機已開、時期已逾數分鐘、乃自行下墜而炸裂、此係經過實在情形、當時我存心預備擲彈、傷人則盡可將彈拋進店堂、我亦可從容逃去、決不致自行炸傷也、我家中祇有老周、年已五十有四、老父已屬殘廢云云、經馮世德庭長核供、諭本案改期七天再訊、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見離水寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>程志前卻實在是要看窮人的家庭，並無別的用意。他伸頭向門里一看，一張黃土坑，差不多將這屢子，佔下了三分之二。屋子里黑黝黝的，看不大清楚。彷彿著坑上中同的地方，舖了一張破煙的灰色毛氈子，靠墻角的所在，又是破木盆子，又是破藤簍子，表面一些亂七八糟的東西，全擁了出來。靠墻一路，有大小七八個瓦罐子，還帶大小十幾個紙盒子，無非都是裝香煙裴腴皂用的，可不料到他們家來，都成了陳設品了。在坑外邊雖然還有幾樣矮小的木器傢具，因爲根本就是破爛的，加上屋子里又光綫不好，那就看不出是什麼來了。地上有黃土磚疊了兩個墩子，常了木凳，有兩個婦人坐在那里。身邊似乎有一個破布包袱，不知是清理著什麼，還不曾了事呢。那位月英姑娘，可是半站半坐著坑沿上，志前，伸進頭來張望時，他以爲是看他來了，咯咯的笑了兩聲，低了頭扭著身子，只向墻角里躱呢。志前這倒是老大的不過意，彷彿自已是特意來看他的呢。趕快的縮回了身軀，就向胡嫂子點著頭道：對不住，我大意了，沒想到有內眷住在里面呢。胡嫂子笑道：女眷要什麼緊，我們那位小妹妹，他就不怕人。那兩位都是比我年紀大的人。程志前知道他這解釋。他是說，他都不避男女之嫌，比他年紀大的，自然不要緊了。不過越是在這里躭擱久了，情形越是尶殮，在那說話的聲中，他已經是點著頭走了出來了。他回到小西天後門，依然由那蓋房子的地方過去，見那些工人又繼續的在工作。（五五）</p>
<h3>廟會速寫</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>山村里的人民，以種田，捕魚爲牛。到了秋收，蓋藏都滿，把酒桑麻；男的女的，老的少的，沒有不喜氣滿面。等到秋盡冬來，雖然霜降天寒，他們的漁船卻要出動了。據說；月白霜清，帶魚的出來尤多，捕捉尤易；魚汛時期，那里可以躱在被窩里。爲著生活的掙扎，一葉扁舟，飄盪大海，渺小的生命，只有求菩薩來保佑的一法。</p>
<p>山谷里有一座紅牆巍峨的破廟，苔蘇滿地，神像駁落。廟的兩廊，放滿了戽水車和漁綱，縱橫地倒臥在泥地上酣睡。這是這座破廟平日的景象；今天可不同了。</p>
<p>黑魆魆擠滿一了羣人；龕中神像換上了一件簇新的紅袍，那神像的臉上，似乎顯出得意的樣兒。兩廊許多許多的戽水車跟漁綱，也醒了過來；從橫臥的地上，爬上承塵下面，倒掛著身子，跟村人一般地得意洋洋烕聽戲。祇見臺上穿紅著緣的人，哼著震天價紹興高調，哼得十分起勁。臺旁搭了許多木板，板上放著凳，這也許是特別包廂或花樓；所以，板上的看客，有穿裙梳髻的中年女人，有簮山花在辦上的小姑孃。這都是今天廟里的特殊情形。——據說，是一年一回的廟會。</p>
<p>民衆娛樂是需要的；那山村的人民，因爲秋盡冬來，爲了生活的緣故，要下海捕魚去了。渺小的生命，是寄在菩薩的手里；所以虔誠地來演戲敬神，以求菩薩的保佑。後來不知道甚麼緣故，借了廟會這個盛節，在破廟的前後，竟擺起許多賭臺來，牌九啦，銅寶啦，青龍，白虎，進門，出門，人山人海，熱鬧異常。可憐無知的鄉䛉，種田，捕魚，砍柴，一年頭辛辛苦苦得來的汗血錢，都送到賭臺上去。像廟會這種的民衆娛樂，是需要的嗎？</p>
<p>海潮澎湃地，打到沙難上來；山風虎虎地吹亂嶺上的松杉；天天是這樣的。廟會呢，一年一回的狂歡吧了！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （張沁芳）</p>
<p>世界上決沒有出了錢而不拿貨品的人。但是學生們出了學費，卻情願放假。美國工人失業者多，其原因在機械發逵。中國長衫朋友失業多。也許是學校發遠所致吧。</p>
<p>飛蛾鳥追求光明，不惜犠牲性命。螢火爲發放光明，不嫌力量薄弱。</p>
<h3>國魂</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>喚回中華民國的國魂，誰都認是中國人眼前的一件最要的急務。真的，中華民國的國魂，確已失蹤了多時了，再不趕速喚回，前途實有無限的危險。不過，喚回國魂，必須先要喚回人魂。這是很易理解的，中國的國魂，就是中國四萬萬五千萬人的人魂所凝合的一個大魂。而國魂的所以失，也就爲先失去了人魂，俗語所謂魂不附體是也。試看：眼前的中國人，不多數是魂不附體嗎？</p>
<p>這個魂何以會不附其體呢，魂逃走了嗎？不，魂和他脫離關係嗎？不，魂給不攖奪了嗎？也不，那末魂是喪失的了？也不盡是，原來魂之不附其體，大多數是出賣的，其次是自放的，自放其魂，也就如先哲的所謂放心。中國眼前大患之釀成，便在魂的出賣與自放。</p>
<p>怎樣呌做自放共魂呢？譬如進學校讀書的學生，他既進學校訊書，那麼他的魂，該是在學校之內，該是在書本之上，然而有種學生，卻偏把他的魂放進咖啡館，放進跳舞塲，放進……這便呌做自放，是無條件的。至於魂的出賣又是怎樣的？也拿漢奸和奸商業作個比喻吧，本來，漢奸，奸商，他既也是中辦人，那知他爲了要得高位厚禒，爲了要獲巨利，總之，爲了要發財，於是軀殻雖爲中國人，而他的魂，卻已出賣給了異族了，這便呌做出賣，是有條件的。雖然，以上云云，不過舉這麼一二個例子：須知其他的自放與出賣的方式還多著咧。也爲自放其魂與出賣其魂的太多了，因而中國的國魂，也告失蹤了，失蹤到今日。</p>
<p>所以，喚回國魂，是要緊的，但喚回人魂，卻尤其要緊。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>所以當我隨著光緒隆裕走進去了後，一瞧滿眼全是熟人，一切佈置，也和北京的皇宮差得很微，使我險些懷疑自已並　不曾到奉天；只有幾座大建築物的式樣，那是和北平截然不同的。</p>
<p>當時也不容許我有充分的時間去細細觀察，只看了個大概情形，便忙著準備接駕。我原沒有什麼東西好準備，可是大家都在忙亂著，我也就閑散不來了。其中忙亂得最厲害的卻要算那一斑古樂隊。他們先是把那幾個裝樂器的架子裝配了起來，各人站到了適宜的地位上去，然後讓他們的下手打架子上挑出幾種應用的樂器來授給他們。—這些所謂應用的樂器便是鐃鈸—銅鑼，和小皮鼓等等：當然更少不掉那架九音鑼。—待他們每個人都把應用的樂器捧到了手里之後，接駕的準備工作便完成了；於是就有一個太監奔出宮去，知照那獨自陪著太后在大門外等候著的李蓮英說，里面一切都準備好了。</p>
<p>接著，又有一個太監跌彈子般的滾進來，向我們報告道：太后起駕了！</p>
<p>這個消息一到，音樂便立即開始演奏起來，整院子的人，都一拜跪下去了。光緒是跪在正中那幾級大理石的石級的旁邊，這樣當太后下轎的時候他便是跪得和太后最貼近的一個人了。他的背後，依次跪著隆裕和瑾妃；在他們兩位的後面，照例總是我那八個女官。我們八個人是不分什麼次序的，誰在前，誰在後，各人侭可隨自已的意思而定，從不受什麼拘束的。（一六五）</p>
<h3>健美行贈江芷黃蘊環二弟</h3>
<p>— 大漢詩人</p>
<p>人孰爲美唯健康。視我二弟江與黃。軀幹顧順胸擴張。肌理紅潤血內藏。雙瞳秀澈垂睫長。好與歐女門容光。先民輕女多毀傷。弱以爲美粉麟妝。羣衆愛好孰適當。林黛玉式病姑娘。乃髪態性欲狂。靄理斯氏說甚詳。時代轉變鳳激揚。一切文化藝術換立塲。畫家反對改七薌。詩人打倒僞宋唐。誰爲現代西子與王㜍。視覺二弟江與黃。</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>天平秋韻</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>汽油艇從明新橋開出，那個花似的蘇州城，便悠然地飛遠蘇州城，便悠然地飛遠，運河上流來的清涼的晨風，吹動髪絲，的確是秋天的情味。待緣野接到我們的幾胸來時，一顆比黃金更亮的血紅的朝陽，像鷄子那麼小，被銜在城齒里，楊柳葉上，彷彿在那里偷偷地看人；然而這一顆凝成世界光明的靈球，魔術似的在變幻，愈戀愈大，愈大愈形灰白，終於鑄成一片銀子，多耀眼！散射在運河面上，波浪都化爲水銀，我們在水銀里呼吸。</p>
<p>鐵嶺關像是畫圖里的磚廓，楓橋市也貧陋得厲害，我們的艇子經過，不但不曾聽得寨山寺的鐘聲，就連江上的漁綱也沒有看見，這由張繼夜泊詩得名的古剎，前度來時，踏過島養和蕪草，現在再也沒有興緻上去摸一摸暨碑了。</p>
<p>一路聽風聽水的到了薄引村，同伴一見四周全是山，都歡呼著，幾位年輕的小妹妹，尤其滿面笑容的，互相爭著登岸。等許多三角小白旗颯揚在五人一隊的行列中，這一色制服的明德坤範的女學生，正像一根美麗的鋉條，很迅速地向夸街上游去。赤了腳，髪髻上挿著火黃色的萬炙的中年嬾人，雖則背著手追逐在後面，那樣不怕麻煩地要我們坐伊的山與，但都被回絕了。如果遊山一定要借別人的腰腳，這還有什麼趣味呢？</p>
<p>到一個處所，四山環羣，囿我中央，在東南一角，露出山凹，浮著淡淡的青痕，不知是什麼峯巒。由此上去，已經見到黃石築成的童子門，因爲是一條長嶺，白鈀的沙路，挺像一匹在游的蛇虺。立在童子門的風洞里指點下面一環紫灰色的磚墻，知道滿林松樹的高義園快到了，繞垣下去，大約流了二十分鐘的汗，那天平山麓的大銀杏樹蔭下，見到樵夫脫下箬笠，掛在矮松樹上，在吸旱煙，使人會巧妙地想到詩的境界。</p>
<p>九松亭里面的乾隆御碑，被塵土和枯葉封住，不曾見到天子的墨蹟。然而我根本就不愛這個賣弄聰明死求風雜的清皇帝。</p>
<p>穿進范公祠，打旁屋跳上石級，轉轉圜圜的上去，一杵鸚鵡石，雖然看起來有一點像啄殘紅粟的靈禽，但比較西圍的那塊濟顛石的形肖，不及遠了。</p>
<p>在杯盂泉的望山樓里休息了一回，推開南腕，遠近的緣樹與黃的稻浪，跟著天半的雲山，滿壑的松風，飛進眼里，飛進耳里。前年靜坐此樓，品著清泉，和老僧談禪，曾萌過袈裟生涯的疾念；到去年在黿頭渚飛雲閣上和曼麗同看湖帆，恢服了進取的精神，也正運行不息著。</p>
<p>我最愛禪房里所掛的張廷濟（叔未）和西洋友人來游天平時共同所賦的英文詩與中國詩，只爲來去怱怱，沒有抄下來，倒是憾事。後來離開杯盂泉，便上一缐天去。這一種大是兩璧梭峭，中船石梯，寛大只容一人進出，而且腰肢太肥的人不能行走，比較靈隱玉乳洞的旭光一縷，又有不同。我們一個一個人細狹的石戾里爬上，若站在山下看來，一定是寸馬豆人了。穿過一線天，再從危磴直登上白雲，氣息喘得緊，大羣的急疇，合成很大的聲霧。立在山顛島瞰古吳的小城，郊野的村樹，以及青蒼的山田，真有立馬岱宗的氣概—天風一陣陣撲上襟袖，即有太陽滿炙股膚，已使夾衣有點耐不住新涼，便把三角分旗一招展，催同伴們下山。因爲石徑欹斜得很，倒也細心地捫璧而下。看看靈巖山上的一座方塔，就不禁想著木瀆鎮上石家飯店的鈀魚滋味，嚥了一口唾涎。</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>敎育部最近改進專科以上學校要點（三）</h3>
<p>三限制敎職員兼職兼課　據二十年度統計、全國專科以上學校敎員共計七千零五十三人、內專任者四千二百四十四人、佔百分之六十、兼校內職務者九百二十八人、佔百分之一八。二、兼校外職務者二千九百二十一人、佔百分之二一。八、職員共計四千二百三十四人、專任者三千一百九十六人、佔百分之七五。五、兼校內課職者九百二十人、佔百分之二一。七、兼校外職務者一百零八人、佔百分之二。八、敎職員合計、除敎職員兼者九百二十人外、實數爲一萬零三百六十七人、敎職員專任者合計爲七千四百四十人、佔百分之六七。七、兼校外職務者合計爲三千零二十九人、佔百分之一二。三、其餘則爲兼校內職務者、敎育部爲提高敎學效率起見、前曾一再通令國立大學、職員須酌量裁減、敎授不得兼任他校或同校其他學院功課、倘有特別情形不能不兼時、每週至多以六小時爲限……院長系主任及其他重要負責人、絕對不得兼任校外課職、凡在校內互兼敎職者並一律不得兼薪、至對於私立專科以上學校、亦嚴格限定兼任敎員不得超過全體敎員三分之一、現擬詳訂定具體限制辦法、以資繼績整頓、</p>
<p>四釐訂大不及專科學校課程標準　據二十年度統計、最多的超過六百種、平均計算、每校約有一百二十餘小時、少者約二十小時、各校平均約三百八十小時、實習時數、多者約一千餘小時、少者僅一二小時或且無之、於此可見各校課程的種類極爲複雜、授課及實習時數極不一致、有些學校因人設課、或競尚新奇、往往一種課程分爲數種、而基本主要課程、轉付缺如、設課既無一定凖則、選課亦無一定程序、因之學生程度愈不整齊、敎育部在兩年前已著手釐訂專科以上學校課程禁準、不過這種工作、極爲繁難、不是短時期所能完成的、現在醫學院和醫學專科學校的課程標準已由醫學敎育委員會草訂完竣、大綱業經完全決定了、只有細目尚須由專家加以審查、此次醫學院和醫專課程標準草案里、有一點值得特別注意的、就是實習和臨的時數特別加多、並附有設備標準、其他各學院各專校課程標準、亦將由部次第聘藉韋家商訂、關於理農工各學院各專校也要特別注重實習、我們覺得大學專校的課程標準不可瑣細呆板、草訂時須多留伸縮餘地、實施後須數年修正一次、以期順應事實的需要和科學的進步、</p>

<h3>由鄉村建設以復興民族實施要點</h3>
<p>中國鄉村敎育社通過之要索</p>
<p>中國鄉村敎育社上次在濟南開會多日、通過要案、即爲由鄉村建設以䅨民族、日前該社理事會在京開通過由鄉村建設以復與民族之實施要點一案、此案極爲重要、不日將由該社呈請敎育部通令各省市社敎機關實行、茲探錄該案要點於下、</p>
<p>（甲）社會敎育的趨重於鄉村建設因爲中國的社會、大部分是鄉村的社會、中國民衆大多數是鄉村的人民、過去從事社會敎育或民衆敎育者、早已感到鄉村的工作重要、而有不少的努力、本社上屆年會更決議、由鄉村建議以復興民族一案、雖整個的實施計畫、還待商量、而今後社會敎育工作的重心、應該移轉於鄉村、卻已沒有疑義、因此我們有下列的建議、一經費的增加和支配以後社會敎育經費應設法繼續增加、新增的經費應盡量分配於鄉村、鄉村社會敎育機關、自身無取龐大、其經費之分配、不應以機關之大小爲比例、而應估量工作影響的範圍和人數、定適當的比例、二機關的設置以後社會敎育新增的機關、應盡量設置於鄉村其原設在城市的機關、應於可能時移設於鄉村、或在鄉村設立分部或分區、進行其工作、同時其他敎育機關亦應設法使能進行鄉村建設工作、三人才的訓練以後爲社會敎育訓練的人才、應有切實的鄉村服務之凖備、其課程與生活陶治、應注意於（子）䜍解鄉村在整個民族上的地位、與所受世界經濟勢力的影響、加深其爲民族努力的意識與由鄉村建設以復興民族的信願、（丑）實習鄉村生產技術與社會組織活動的內容、與指揮推進的辦法、（寅體騐鄉村的疾苦、堅忍耐勞、深思苦幹、以創造自已的新生活、）</p>
<p>（乙）實施社會敎育的幾個原則一目的培養民衆的幾種基本的力量、尤先的是生產的與組織的力量、使漸能以自力的力量、改善自已的生活、期於以鄉村爲起點、使整個民族、能以自已的力量恢復民族的精神二內容主要的就是這時鄉村所急諮的新生產的工具與技術和新的社會組織的方式與活動、三方法也就不外乎由當地民衆所信仰的人們（如當地本無此種人材即當設法訓練）來指導與推進、這些工俱技術方式、活動的使用、使民衆於繼續使用之中、由行而知、由做而學、關於指導與推進的個別的方法、這里不能列舉、下列的是幾個普通的例子、（子）握住實際生活問題如因農產短少、而改良種子農具和耕作方法、因商人壟斷而組織合作運銷因水旱災審而造堤浚河、因交通困難、而修橋築路、因匪患而訓練自衛、因疾疫而指導公共衛生、一切設施、要從農人自身感覺迫的切問題出發、（丑）顧及農人固有經騐凡新的工具技術以及社會組織的方式和活動、倘若興農人固有的生活經騐、相差過遠、便無法接受、不會使用、要在由已能及不能由已知及不知因所固有的經騐、而引發勸導、（寅）注重示範凡新的工具與技術的介紹推廣要先有具體功用的表證農人看懂了就自然樂於使用、口語說明固然不夠、文字傳播、有時更屬徒然、（卯）引起自動凡新的社會組織、如合作社、自衛團等、要幫助農人自已發起、自已試做、而避免不了代辦、也應當竟力使他們的自已參加、到相當的時候、完全由農人自已維持、（辰）表現成績如農飼畜或工藝物品的展覧、道路橋標或其他工程的完成、自衛的演習等、應有鄉村的盛大的集會、其意義不在於誇示指導者的成績、而在使民衆於觀摩激勸之中、感覺到自已成功的滿足、發現出自已可能的力量、因而更加願意、繼續增長其力量、</p>
<p>（丙）社會敎育自身力量的運用現在社會敎育的機會和團體、往往因爲各自的零散分離、而不能發生偉大的力量、要能零散者漸能完整、分離者漸能集中、我們惟有在共同的蔪向與共同的工作上使機關與團體間彼此能夠密切和聯絡、只有聯絡、只有組織、才有力量、我們敢說因此、我們又建議下列各點一準對著整個民族我們於各自努力一項鄉村工作苛一個鄉村的改進時、要照著這共同的蔪向、時時注意於這鄉村與整個民族的聯擊、以至與世界經濟政治勢力的聯擊、在這聯擊中、鄉村不是一個鄉村的改進時、要照著這共同的蔪向、時時注意於這鄉村與整個民族的聯擊、以至與世界經濟政治勢力的聯擊、在這聯擊中、鄉村不是一個孤立的隔離的單位、我們對於一切設施、不以解決局部的問題爲滿足、而應當顧及其與整個民族問題的影響、二認定工作中心我們在一個時間、要佔量我們自已的能力、就鄉村的需要、認定培養民衆生產與組織的力量爲工作中心、集中了精神去解決、一切無目的的舖張、不必要的宜傳、都是力量的浪費、應當竭力避免、三分工合作我們必須與經濟黨政機關盡力取得有效的聯絡、就是我們的較大規模的研究實騐機關也、必須興其他文化學術機關謀可能的聯絡、務集合相關的努力於鄉村建設問題之上、各盡所能、分工合作、四擴大組織社會敎育機關自身、無論以區域言、如主與村區與區、或以工作單位言、如各合作社各自衛團體、也憑當逐漸聯絡、逐漸擴大其組織、省立社會敎育育機關、社會敎育補導機關、以及較大的縣立社會敎育機關、都應該負起聯絡組織的責任、</p>

<h3>長期汛餘波猶在拆價續抬至一角二分</h3>
<p>昨爲長期結束後之第一日、各種未了手續、即須補理、致市況繁瑣如舊、市塲中拆息已拾高至一角二分、較之前日午市加好四分、而劉頭加水初時仍做七分、迨後遞序退至三分爲止、拆票交易、早市轉賬及新交易三百九十餘萬、午市交易七十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖八十餘萬、新做一百四十餘萬、長期補理一四十餘萬、銀行收解外商銀行收解票欵三百十餘萬、各種貨滙押墊什欵收解四百八十餘萬、電匯欵七十餘萬、補理結欵二百五十餘萬、外匯結欵七十餘萬、出倉八十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百另幾萬、各種貨匯墊稅電什諸欵收三百十餘萬、進倉五十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百七十餘萬、進倉五十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百七十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊什欵收解四百四十餘萬、出倉五十萬錢莊洋公單收解四千三百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解七百四十餘萬、各路匯欵七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解七百四十餘萬、各路匯欵七十餘萬、鈔票收加碯十餘萬、發出一百二十餘萬、收現六十餘萬、客路來源三十萬、去胃四十萬、又票據交換所一日交換總數、銀圓二千五百二十三萬九千六百二十三元正、內計銀圓二千五百二十三萬九千六百二十三元正、內計銀圓一千九百四十六萬二千六百四十九元一角三分、匯劃銀圓五百七十七萬六千九百七十三元八角七分、</p>

<h3>紗花金融界猛烈斬多禁紗突然崩潰</h3>
<p>紗市跌風驟熾、金融界吸收之額、大批吐出、以致檀面鬆動、銀拆又昻至一角二分、人心愈見虛弱、日商亦有拋出、惟一部份因各廠存貨較前已抽空不少、傾向做多、</p>
<h3>金雞一瀉兩元六角</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤即疲、以美棉趙弱、塲中買戶缺乏、賣氣突濃、且銀行界將多頭斬結不少、致檀面大鬆、故市盤步開跌、結果各月均跌二元三。五。七。九角至三元、午後市塲上傳說美商又有大批白銀出口、而銀根奇緊、人氣仍疲、但拍至收盤時聞現紗交易尚有一千三百餘包、收盤價稍昻四五角、結果各月比前市漲跌一。二。四角、全日成交統計六萬一千三百包、查賣出同孚一千六百包、恒益二千零五十包、明德一千包、同豐一千一百包、長豐二千零五包、潤康一千零五十包、信誠四千一百包、錦昌六百包、同興七百五十包、元一二千一百五十包、買進慎畾一千五百包、賡豐九百包、大孚四百包、遠記二千一百包、合興七百包、恒德二千五百包、慎記八百包、大昶一千七百包、仁豐八百五十包、同和五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉田明春有擴大訊標花賣戶蠭起</h3>
<p>棉市跌夙劇列、因美棉明年十月期市價步跌、因田畝耕種明年恐有擴大消息、於是雙方壓迫、十月期獨跌二十餘磅音、致人心突起惶恐、同時紗市不振、市盤乃愈趨下落矣、</p>
<h3>鄭標劇跌五角半</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉明年十月期跌風尤烈、致人心惶慮、跌風頗熾、各月均跌五六角、午後因紗市不振、塲內形勢仍鬆、且有一部份多頭了結、各月又跌五分、全日成交統計十三萬七千八百擔、查賣出長和五千八百擔、裕康二千一百擔、同孚四千六百擔、大豐二千一百擔、賡豐七千一百擔、同興二千三百擔、益康五千三百擔、慎昌三千五百擔、義成四千七百擔、潤康六千擔、買進吉豐一千三百擔、大孚五千九百擔、通記二千七百擔、達記一千八百擔、源大五千一百擔、泰興一千七百擔、慎德一千五百擔、仁豐七千二百擔、泰昌三千五百擔、長豐一千七百擔、瑞源一千四百擔、賡豐六千擔、大昶一千四百擔、永昌一千八百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>紗布交易所十一月期標花、自十一月一日起買賣新交易增收特別證金每擔南元、所做兩存賬收取一方、業巴揭示城市塲焉、</p>
<h3>美棉近遠期情形複雜</h3>
<p>十月期再跌廿六磅音</p>
<p>明年美棉產限制問題之不可知、致近期興遠期情形爲之複雜、交易者目光迷亂、老棉市價僅跌六至十四磅音、新棉則下降二十六磅音、南方供給微小、各方需要遲綏、消耗與出口均極惡劣、故人心紛歧、一般以爲目下政府收集大批押欵棉花、遲早終須出籠、信任心於是動搖、市況乃呈萎靡、英棉期貨跌一至三點、印棉因歐洲出口商及日商售出而較、計平果爾及白羅溪跌半羅比、奧婦辣漲二角半、原電錄左、（三十一日電）</p>
<h3>美棉私家估計</h3>

<h3>糧食澳麥速半貨定成一船引起粉麥劇跌</h3>
<p>粉跌七分至八分半</p>
<p>麥跌一角六至兩角</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩繼則大跌之象以洋麥報價、前日好一三角左右、昨小一角零、故開價時、人心頗屬堅定、較之前月底收價、計好一二分不等、但至二盤以後、猛烈之跌風、忽然發生、傳大廠定成澳麥一船、急裝價祇四元九角三分、市塲之投機幫聞此消息、紛紛暢拋、業外多頭、亦順勢猛出、致市面已呈搖搖欲墮之象、迫至下午開盤、以業外之拋風又盛、廠方亦有少數出檔、兼之麥市亦告不穩、因此市價步見狂落、此種景象、全爲洋麥定成所衝動、以實銷方面、南洋幫略有生意、本不應嫩是大跌也、結果本月份較前月底跌七分二厘半、十二月份跌八分半、一月份跌七分、二月份跌七分二厘半、三月份跌八分二厘半、四月份初開四角八分七厘半、收價跌至四角、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼跌之象、洋麥報價、兩日中上落無幾、故開價時人心尚定、漸以內地多頭回出、兼之紛市開價之後、即見下跌、又傳洋麥之繼續成交、是以業中人之拋貨、已漸踴躍、市面亦步見鬆跌、迨至下午開盤、近期人心、會見狂瀉、以澳麥定成、且可逮裝、標準前途、勢難擯住、故拋賣特暢、跌度竟遠二角、亦爲近來所罕見也、結果本月份計狂跌二角之巨、十二月份跌一角八分、一月份跌一角四分、二月份跌一角六分、餘無比較、現麥因廠需尚殷、喊價仍見站住、開山東徐州瑤灣蚌埠麥三元八角六分、次八角四分、計四萬包、由福新辦去、</p>
<h3>美麥下跌即有收進</h3>
<p>總歸收成歉薄之故</p>
<p>支加哥麥市仍在國外市情支配之下、加政府將限止溫尼配雜標投機交易之恐嚇、仍懸於交易者心目中、阿根廷新玉米上市之消息亦復不利、加以國外市況呆滯、加麥有大量剃餘、小麥價格下跌一分有餘、低價時購買衆多、價格回昂、一般逆料一日發表之小麥與玉米收成估計、皆利多方、</p>
<h3>蘇同粳到稀好一角</h3>
<p>（滬南）各幫來源稍見轉夥、計共到回十餘號、（貨共六千餘石）本街方面仍見活動、客幫包胃忽淡、窯六種等新薄稻市況混沌中猶守老盤野白稻等相仿、僅常幫蘇同幫等粳、售方藉到稀喊高、挺起一尺、而蘆尖除高料者稍見帶秀外、中市者悉不定立、羊尖貨跌無市、陰元酒戶續動、貨源太旺、成供過於求、價跌二角左右、變元則反以乏貨見秀、窯掉包青、祇青島幫去五十包而已、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各幫來源二十餘號、市上各貨去胃、新粳新羊秈早薄稻陳白元陰元尚好、破粳稍滯、新陳埠客尖續化、市形新粳新羊秈早薄稻堅挺、新杜尖加近角、陳白元加一角左右、破粳陰元價形平定、新陳埠客尖價加角許、</p>
<h3>證券債券行市跌後重回</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、初因洋拆忽然提高至一角二分、銀根有趨緊之勢、市塲並造作大批現金運京之流言、可謂捕風捉影、其實洋拆偶商、完全係一時之現象、時局形勢轉優、債市自可趨高、故昨日一度鬆跌、旋即回高、有過之無不及、前途形勢、尚係混沌局面、昨日經過、開盤散戶賣出甚湧、編遣驟小四角半、餘亦小二三角不等、塲上有八號新組織登塲、有百餘萬之進胃、次盤即見一致回高二三角、交易則並不踴躍、午後交易愈見清閑、市價堅穩如故、開盤好一二角、收盤稍有混沌、高低不同之象、但並無疲落之狀按環境深閱、一時未必有何重大變化、故市價或仍不能出盤旋範圖書、市價結果、略好五分一角至二角左右、成交總數、計共一千、百六十八萬五千元、股票十股、茲將其漲跌情形、列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元股票單位一股）</p>
<h3>糖市潮青續開五百餘包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以銷路依然不暢、故雖有關金堅定之寄託、終無回振希望、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨普通仍呌十八元八角、未成、本棧貨十八元九角、稍有劃出、轉口貨呌五元五角半、亦無成交、八九號普通荷赤十四元零五分、交易不多、轉口貨呌五元一角、未成、本廠綿白振裕一號十七元二角、平定、號盤有廣幫開出那利白數十包、價爲十八元、潮幫昨開出潮晉五百數十包計白包提莊青價爲十三元半、普通油包黃崗青十二元八角至七角六角半、油包隆港青十一元四角至三角、比前無甚上落、趨勢穩定、</p>

<h3>打生活一下耳光</h3>
<p>— 孤西</p>
<p>應該挺起硬良的態度，對生活——彷佛不啻將它打一下耳光那麼的地去做人！</p>
<p>在這一個時代，那儼然俯瞰著生活，對於我們，原來就是個敵人：常敵人面前，你不能猶欵你的巴掌，你還能不鼓著那股幾近乎捕門底的勁兒嗎？</p>
<p>活著的事只是戰爭！彷彿廚川白村曾說過這樣的話一個了解著強烈的生存意義的人，我想會了解這一句話是一注真理的。對生活，你如果沒有那一宗將打它耳光的勇氣，批轉來，它——生活就會打你的耳光呢！</p>
<p>這打生活一下耳光的事，可以說是一種生的英勇的行爲。一個生活著不僅僅祇爲了生活血已的人是應該有這一宗常常置自已於戰門中的英勇行爲的！</p>
<p>人類革命史上記載著的多少先烈們，不是都爲著檢求一宗滿溢的生命和一個真實的生存而對生活打了耳光嗎？打生活一下耳光，是生存捕門的開始：這一個捕門的開始所引起的結果，也許連自已也會遭到粉碎的命運，但是爲了對真正底生存的理解，爲了已深解著生底強烈的意義的緣故，所以即使知道這其間有著粉碎自已的生活的殉難者，不是到了斷頭臺上（眼見自已的血漿就將飛濺了的時候），還是微笑著，而且仍然那麼不勉強地嗎？</p>
<p>愛真理，忠實地生活！這是每一個不糊塗的人都應該抱有的生活態度！如果遇有足以戮審真理以及摧毀真正底生存的任何障礙時，對於飽和的包含著這一宗障礙的舊生活體系，我們就應該不鄙吝地伸出巴掌去打它一下耳光！並且，需要時還得準備著最後自已犧牲的精神</p>
<p>敢於打這麼一下耳光，而且準備了最後自已犠甡的，是人類歷史中最可寶貴的英勇行爲！要使人類更前進一步，是完全賴了這個的！</p>
<p>爲著要生活於真理與自由表面，我們是應該時時刻刻挺著硬朗的搏門姿態來做人的。須要用更加廣大的心靈擁抱世界，去深切的地愛世界，這才會使你得到滿溢底生命！</p>
<p>有生一日，就應該挺起胸，舉著堅苦的步履，邁步走向人生險嵮之最尖頂，使自已活著的每一剎那都表現爲生之強列之意義，這一種努力，我想是正當的吧！</p>
<p>對生活，即使它對你展盡了苦難，你也不應該有所畏縮！須要直面人生，敢於作深刻的門爭，作爲一個果敢的生活的戰士。應該具有像高爾基所說的連死也不要緊的，我們非和真理一起走不可的那種崛強的精神！這才不是一個屈辱於生活的懦怯者！</p>
<p>當前的磨難就是你的對手，</p>
<p>運盡氣力去和它苦門，</p>
<p>累得你周身的汗毛都擎著汗洙，</p>
<p>但你須咬緊牙關不敢輕忽，……</p>
<p>這樣，你活著帶一點崛強，</p>
<p>侭多苦澀，苦澀中有你獨到的真昧！</p>
<p>（臧克家：生活）</p>
<p>正因爲目前生活的磨難我們像一個敵人，所以我們更不應示弱。我們須咬緊牙關不敢輕忽地去和它苦門！一個深愛著真正底知活的人，決不肯遷就與屈辱於生活的！</p>
<p>名作家Ａ聶維洛夫在我要活那一個短篇里帶著十二分懲氣地說：我對於生活的愛，領導我去戰門！我去死，就因爲我要活！……這些警句所昭示我們的，幾幾乎就是我前面所說的：應該挺著硬朗的態度，對生活——彷彿不啻將打它一下耳光那麼的地去做人的那宗生活態度！</p>
<p>無論如何，當這一個時代，是須要執著這一種態度正面著生活，挺著敢於打它一下耳光的態度來做人的！更進一著，在必要的時候，對生活我們不僅止於打它一下耳光便算完事了哩！</p>
<h3>店主</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>秋雨漸漸把炎戚趕走時，掛著招待學員的幌子的幾個附近學校的公寓都宜告客滿了，我的長久住處成了問題，每天找著報端的房屋出租的廣告，結果是發現了一個新辦的公寓式的宿舍，離學校不太遠，但也有二里路的樣子，便決心去看看。</p>
<p>我把自行車靠在外院的牆上，輪子上的泥痕到那里停止了。門房給通報後，走出一個胖胖的三十多歲的中年人來，據說是在中學里當過職員的，現在大約是不耐清苦便異想天開地改行，來經營這個宿舍。我瞧瞧那挺挺然的肚子與幾乎啣接的兩道濃眉，找不出一點所謂讀書人所有的文氣概，覺得很高興。</p>
<p>有混合間，有獨人間。他引著我前院後院地看著。告訴我租價。說是獨人間的七塊錢一月，不包飯還得加兩塊燈水錢。我心里笑著，這是等於強迫包了。爲著怕人多的嘀雜便決心硬著頭皮定了單人間的，孤獨慣了的人在衆人的嘻笑中反而會感到頭痛的。</p>
<p>第二天下午，便帶著簡單的行李搬了去，一屋子的太陽倒怪熱，然而窗戶是無法關上，前些天的雨水使大漲了。到晚上，自已頗聚精會神地解開綱籃，把東西拿出來。承茶房的好章，通知我還有十分鐘熄燈，時候是九點五十分，我看看章程：</p>
<p>不是星期日和星期六全是十二點熄麼？</p>
<p>不，這邊主人新改的，星期與平日一樣了。</p>
<p>我在黑暗中摸索著舖蓋里的被褥與枕頭。</p>
<p>在吃飯時，慢慢與寥寥的幾個同信的人熟識了，大家對著沒有油水的素食似的菜皺眉㑳笑，愛吃豬肉的跑到廚房去問大師傳：</p>
<p>豬肉不是一塊錢五斤麼？</p>
<p>錢是主人限制住的啦，我是照吩咐辦，怪也怪不得我，誰不願意做好菜！</p>
<p>大家便絨口了，到晚上，我吃著鹹菜餞頭，因爲只包了兩頓，早上門口有的是燒餅油條的呌賣者。</p>
<p>每天有人來看屋子，胖主人領著巡迥著，行家話是越來越多了，有幾個都嫌沒有獨人間的空間，不願搬來了。</p>
<p>昨天早上，主人領了工頭來量屋子準備多隔單間，量到這小屋的鄰室時，嫌分爲三間太小，兩間又太大，這使這位精明的主人爲難了，便來敵我的門：</p>
<p>可不可以，唉，很對不住的哪，把這間屋的板壁往里推一二尺？臉是怪不好意思地紅著。</p>
<p>爲什麼要不識相地作梗呢？我無法地慷慨了。回報的是幾個喘不過氣來的謝謝，兩道濃屆蓋著的小眼都發亮了，踏著闊步去通知了匠人。</p>
<p>今天回來，四合院里充滿了木匠的東敲西鋸的聲音，使我想起那天對屋一個人爲了開話匣子被迫停止的事，因爲主人的孩子在午睡，急得那位矮矮的有著黃黃的頭髪的太太出來直瞪眼睛。今天卻一院子鬧翻了。進屋放下書包，嘿，俺的屋子被割去二尺多的一條啦！正把我放車的地方都佔了去，廓下是不凖放的，嫌不整齊。</p>
<p>這副精明的頭腦是怎麼來的呢？我獨自個瞅著狹長的小屋苦笑。</p>
<p>傍晚，主人家來了客，在上屋打起牌來，有力的摔牌聲與歉呌暗示胖主人今天心里的欣慰。</p>
<h3>歸來（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>船離開了香港，人就喘了一口舒服的氣，彷佛出了狹的籠那麼似的。因爲由仰光動身，只要船靠攏一個商埠，無論是檳榔嶼，或是星加坡，總要看見立在街頭指揮車馬呼鳴人衆的棕色漠子，和仰光香港的一樣，穿著同樣的制服，纏著同樣的大包頭，拿著同樣的木榨，禁不住使人憂鬰起來，覺得好像永遠滾在別人的手掌中一般。</p>
<p>向暮的時候，海面上佈著大霧，濕氣侵人的眉梢和手指。陰曆十二月的寒風，和著鳥藍色的煤煙，又一陣陣地直向甲板上，船尾上，兇暴地亂掃。前幾天還在明媚晴朗的印度洋上，赤著膊子，依著船欄逍遙地看波上的飛魚，天末的小島，以及日頭的東昇和西落，現在卻使人抖縮著身子，朝艙下人多的地方鑽去了，並且海面上，全是沉悶的霧，也沒什麼可看的，何況好些一兩天內就要登岸的南中國人，正圖著毛氈閉著眼睛，做著歸鄉的好夢呢！</p>
<p>船尾上冷清清的，我一個人獨自留著，帶著愉悅的好奇的微笑，展望著躺在四週的未曾一面的太平洋，因爲我以前是由陸地走到外國去的，現在歸來便像一個陌生的旅人漂泊到陌生的國度一般的了。同時，我慶幸著我此後到的地方：大約該不會再看見在殖民地所遇著的不愉快的東西吧！雖然，掛在船尾的外國旗子，荷荷地搖蕩在海風中，是帶著一點嘲笑的聲音的。</p>
<p>冷呵！冷呵！</p>
<p>驀地一個人來在我身邊，用手呵著氣，這麼說著。身上緊里著廉價的外國大衣，頸子邊卻露出一厚層中國式的領頭，足下也是中國式的棉鞋。打鳥帽的遮陽下面，靈活地閃著一對向人討好的眼睛。</p>
<p>船靠在香港，他便同著他這對常常向人討好的眼睛，出現在旅客叢中，我的週遭了。人家幾個人一堆，在談著汕頭或是廣州的時候，他會呵，那好地方呵！……開頭這樣一句，參加進來。如果別人在講著龍虎鬬燕窩魚翅那類的菜，他也會從旁添言湊趣的說道：呵，那味道不錯呵。現在他見我沒有理他，便隨著我朝海面上瞭望的視綫，看了一會，就正如先前要同人搭話那麼似的開口道：</p>
<p>呵，看起來真不錯呵！</p>
<p>並且微微地點著頭好像很在讚美的光景但寒冷的風和寒冷的濕氣，卻使他的聲音帶著頭抖而且發沙起來。我很喜歡孤寂地同天同海同霧一塊兒在著，和以前高興一個人走在深山老林中一樣，對於他在這時的出現，已經感到不快，現又聽見這麼一句無聊的附和的言語，簡直有點生氣了。然而，看見他那一對從打島帽的遮陽下望過來的討好的眼睛，就只好勉強同他攀談著，做出好的臉色。因爲他除了這一點愛同人嘮叨愛附和別人的小毛病而外，究竟還有些令人歡喜的地方：像同人家在談著什麼的時候，假如人家摸出紙煙來，剛啣在嘴，他便趕忙擦烯一隻火柴。慇懃湊了過來。香港的小販，趁船停泊著，便拿著新做好的外國大衣，到船上來，在我面前兜賣。他就把嘴巴挨在我的肩上小聲說：</p>
<p>就是十塊錢也值得，到廈門十五六元也買不著呵！</p>
<p>同時又大聲地呼喝小販。</p>
<p>减一塊，八塊吧！……人家就要你的了。</p>
<h3>北平風光（獨幕喜劇）（一）</h3>
<p>— 徐訏</p>
<p>時：隨便指一個早晨好了。</p>
<p>地：就像北平的大學生們所寓的地方吧。</p>
<p>人：劉遷三，韓琴赤，卜整儀，張德娟，王掌櫃，夥計。</p>
<p>景：樸素的屋子，窮亂的一切。床有三張，板舖而已！開幕時劉韓尚睡著，卜坐在床沿穿舊的皮鞋。</p>
<p>卜：今天我一定可以走到第三步啦！</p>
<p>劉：到了建設時期了嗎？</p>
<p>韓：唔……（興奮）破壞還沒有完，怎麼就講到建設！</p>
<p>卜：誰給你講國事啦！我們講的是戀愛呢！</p>
<p>劉：我們講的是老對張小姐進取的步驟。</p>
<p>韓：飯都没得吃，還講戀愛，</p>
<p>卜：食色性也！那一方面有運氣，就那一方面先解决。</p>
<p>劉：有了愛人，還講什麽有吃没吃的！</p>
<p>卜：所以我要趕快進行，把那份客飯給你們吃，省得三個人的肚子老不飽。</p>
<p>韓：飽暖而患淫樂！你不飽不暖還要思淫樂？</p>
<p>卜：變愛那能算淫樂？</p>
<p>劉：戀愛難道是飽暖？</p>
<p>卜：難道除飽暖淫樂以外沒有第三樣東西了嗎？</p>
<p>韓：那麼你說變愛是什麼？</p>
<p>卜：變愛是一種力量！最偉大的力量！</p>
<p>韓：是什麼力最？</p>
<p>卜：是找飯的一個力量。比方我這次成功以後，我一定可以找飯大家吃。</p>
<p>韓：假若是真的，我一定出全力助你！</p>
<p>劉：我也極願意幫助你，不過昨天昨上的飯，我真吃得太少，你現在先弄個燒餅我吃吧！</p>
<p>卜：我回頭一定去想法，不過她今天或許要來呢？</p>
<p>韓劉：來這兒？那麼我們可以見見她了。</p>
<p>卜：自然囉！而且我正要你們幫助我！</p>
<p>韓：怎麼樣幫助你？</p>
<p>卜：第一步，要把你們二張床撤掉，把屋子好好的佈置一下。</p>
<p>劉：那就算你一個人住的啦！</p>
<p>卜：（裝鬼臉）第二步，我的劉！（拍劉）再用你的聰明找些錢來吧！</p>
<p>韓：第三步呢？</p>
<p>卜：老劉麼，照這樣著這兒的掌櫃，別讓他再來討論，老韓麼，在屋里來強迫她：於是我我瀟瀟灑灑的進來（裝控）用聰明的方法把你退出去！我呢，把她在哭的臉安慰出笑容來，於是輕輕地給她一個Ｋiss，你說這是多麼的甜美</p>
<p>劉：老韓去對付掌櫃的吧！我來強迫迷死張好不好？</p>
<p>韓：我來用一點聰敘的手段弄點錢來吧！</p>

<p>電信特刋</p>
<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>「電氣」新銓</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>從前電信事業，每爲社會所指摘，謂總帶有幾分官僚色彩。所謂官僚色彩，無非若干長電局者，以官自居。官氣十足，官聲四佈；且民衆以爲電局係官辦，遂亦自電局爲官衙而已。</p>
<p>時入民國，官氣掃除，電局情形，爲之丕變，政府便利民衆通信，設立局臺，雖是機關，不啻商肆。電局之長，猶商肆之經理，無所謂官也；辦事人員以及信差，猶商肆之店員與店差，亦無所謂藉官自重也。官氣官氣，已成暮氣，電界具朝氣，暮氣當然不能令其存在。</p>
<p>不過官氣雖然絕跡，但受新社會之沐浴，或難免發生一種洋氣，歐風美雨，漸受董陶，視已甚高，洋洋自得，尤以置身於大都會或通商巨埠者爲甚，洋氣縱非暮氣，但在商業揚中，亦每能使主顧望而卻步，見而生厭。</p>
<p>現在之電信界所帶色彩，即非官化之官氣，尤非洋化之洋氣，乃抱有改革決心之勇氣，而提倡合乎新生活運動之和氣，對外必和顏悅色，對內則和衷共濟，在古語上說，即和氣致祥，在商業上說，即和氣生財。</p>
<p>電信界以勇氣辦理事業，以和氣對待主顧，則社會人士，自必樂與交接，其尚有關於業務不滿意者，侭可提出質問，或要求改良，電信界人，當然能竭誠授受，惟記者仍希望利用電信的人們，遇有應行質問或要求者，事前亦應平心靜氣，加以思量，斯則對於雙方均有利益者也。</p>
<p>涉筆至此，有友來，謂余所談爲氣，且係電信界之氣，氣云何哉？不如姑題爲電氣，從之，遂以電氣名我篇。</p>
<h3>華文電報收發辦法之改善</h3>
<p>— 明炯</p>
<p>近來交通當局對於電報業務之改進，極爲努力，如果確係有利民衆，雖於營業上受有影響，亦所不惜。茲聞電政司最近對於華文電報的計費辦法，又有下列各項改善辦法的實施。</p>
<p>一女性收報人之稱謂準列入住址字數計費</p>
<p>查華文電報省費新章規定：收報人之職銜如委員部長師長等準列入住址字數之內，惟各種稱謂及套語如兄先生太太女士鑒勛鑒等，均應作爲電文按字計費。至收報人名址與電文之間，向由電報局臺收發員用雙劃記號隔開。但發寄女性之電報，其收報人往往僅有姓氏而無名字，例如杭州西湖凌雲別墅王太太病危速來據，按照上述規一辦法，太太兩字應作電文計費，雙劃記號應書於王字之後，收報人收到該電時，其來報紙所列字樣，當爲杭州西湖凌雲別墅王太太病危速來曉，似覺有失原電意義，或易引起收報人誤會。且我國習俗，中年以上之女性，並無名字者居多，即有之亦多不肯公開示人，偶有函電往來，不得不用稱謂代替名字，電政司有見於斯，特予變通辦理，將上述辦法修正爲凡發寄女性之電報，如收報人確係祇有姓氏，而無名字者，應準將稱謂列入住址。此雖小節，然於發報大深爲便利也。</p>
<p>二修正華文電報內用阿拉伯數目字書寫辦法</p>
<p>交通部自訂定華文電報內用阿拉伯字書寫門牌號數及各項數目辦法通飭各電報局臺遵照辦理後，因該辦法第四條曾規定：凡華文明語電報內所用之阿拉伯數目字，如有前後文義可證其確係表示門牌號數或銀錢貨物等數目，而並無其他隱秘之意義者，發報人雖未於該項數目字之前後註明號元角斤件等單位字，亦準照用。但發報人往往曲解條文，將電文過度簡略，以圖省費，例如下列一電江陰大通輪局豫（200）（215）（1300）連用三個阿拉伯數目字，並無明白貫串之意義，發報局臺雖照明語收費，惟收報局臺因該電電文意義晦隱，按照該項辦法第五條之規定，應照密語計費，即電知發報局臺補收報費，而發報人則堅稱該電原係明語，以致常有發生爭執情事。電政司因此將該條條文酌予修正爲：華文明語電報內所用阿拉伯數目字之後，必須加註號元角斤件等單位字，藉以表示其確係門牌號數或銀錢貨物等數目。例如588上海購秈米（750）石麥（400）斛此項單位字，發報人如有漏註者，局臺收報員應請其添註。倘不照辦，全電概照密語計費。俾符華文明語電報之定義，而免收報局臺之誤會。</p>
<p>三規定華文銀行明語電報內用對號字辦法</p>
<p>銀行及銀錢業所發明語匯欵電報，因恐僞冒，常於電文首端或末尾用特約密語對號字（俗稱壓腳字）一個，此項對號字在洋文明語電報內稱爲Ｃheck　word向準照用。惟華文明語電報尚無此規定。電政司茲已規定華文銀行或銀錢業明語電報，得於電文首端或末尾用對號字一個，並得用阿拉伯數目字代表發電日期及發表號數。例如6892上海交萬泰銀一千兩預豐洋二萬元05742.2502該電末尾第二碼（0572）即係密碼對號字，其最末一碼（2502）係代表二十五日所發第二號電。嗣後銀行或銀錢業發寄明語匯欵電報可得相當保障，以杜僞冒。</p>
<h3>鄉村電話的檢討</h3>
<p>— 李紹美</p>
<p>鄉村電話Ｒural　Telephone　Service這個名詞，近來差不多在報章上不大看見了。在人們大呼建設農村的時候，反爾銷聲匿跡，這不是怪事嗎？然而，據作者個人的考察，覺得現在人們將鄉村電話與長途電話混爲一談。其實，各處所辦的鄉村電話很不少：不過統稱之爲長途電話便了。例如武漢地方，有省政府長途電話管理處，此外又有縣政府長途電話管理處。同在一個區域之內，有兩個性質相同的機關，人們驟然看見，多少總以爲可以合併的。不，武昌縣所辦的電話，應該稱爲鄉村電話。如金口，青山，豹子懈等地方，皆是一些鄉下鎮市，可惜人們忽略了這一點。</p>
<p>裝設鄉村電話，機綫可以因陋就簡一點，這就是與長途電話根本不同的地方。就經濟方面而論，若把長途電話的好材料，用這於鄉村電話，那也就未免太奢侈了。復次，鄉村電話，不祇是縣治下的點綴品，也不祇是給鄉老兒增長見識的玩意兒，尤其是復興農村的一種恩物。揀牠的顯著的功用，就明一下：</p>
<p>一防匪　目下鄉鎮地面很不安靖，可算匪盜如毛。鄉鎮與鄉鎮間，常要守望相助。必要時，還要向縣城告急。村中平常召集丁壯的方法，就是鳴鉦或是放锍：但是這種信號太簡單，發號的人，須十分審慎，被召的丁壯，心里也十分驚疑。在這種緊張情況之下，要從容不迫地處理，就賴電話的使用了。</p>
<p>二護堤　每年國家化費很多的錢，築提防水。但是，每年沿工河的縣份，因堤防缺口的，不知凡幾。綜計財產的損失，大約有幾千萬。一半是由天時，一半是由人事。當守提搶險的時候，第一感覺困難的事情，就是工人不敷分配，倘能劃出守望地段，再利用電話互通消息，則工人自然容易集中，不致疲於奔命了。再則，堤內農民，時時得著確實消息，至少限度，亦當有所準備，不致糊里糊塗，葬身魚腹。</p>
<p>三調車，現在各鄉鎮，多有汽車道了。行的問題，較先方便得多。但有件事情，是行人最難受的。就是汽車駛至中途，機器忽然發生毛病，拋起銷來。遇了這類的事，如附近有電話可通。立時可以調派別的汽車來接替。否則要白費人家多少時間，要躭誤人家多少要事。</p>
<p>四養林　年來早荒是常見的，多半是森林太少的緣故。將來無論中央和地方政府，必然是要努力造林的。但是，森林最怕火災，例如在美國，每次森林失慎，損失就是鉅萬。所以培植森林，必用警察隨時守護。並須設置電話，以利消防。</p>
<p>前面所說的，都是一些理論和原則。作者卻要舉出兩個耳聞的事實來，表現鄉村電話的效用。</p>
<p>一有一次，正是暑天的夜晚，天氣執得利害。在武昌的江邊，露宿的人們很多。到了夜靜，忽然聽得江心的小舟上，發出慘厲的救命聲。岸上的人們，當時俱被驚起，有的更僱著劃了，前去救護。奈小舟行走如飛，人們追撶不上，多有睜著兩隻眼，替這不幸的人傷感面又嘆息。就中有一個伶俐的警士，悄悄的到縣政府去用電話通知附近的各鄉鎮，囑咐他們留心盤查。到了天明，這一椿疑案，就在青山鎮破獲了。原來有一個轉運公司的夥計，帶了幾百塊洋錢，在鮎魚套車站下車，因爲天氣很熱，便僱劃子往漢口。因此劃夫先演了一齣殺人越貨的慘劇，然後遠逸青山。那知他雖有亡命的本事，竟不及電話的迅速啊！</p>
<p>二在雲夢縣地方，忽來了幾個農夫，到縣里卻報案。訴的是他們的耕牛，在夜里被人盜走了。耕牛是中國農村中最重要的工具，若是找不到，也許會影響他們的生計吧。當時，衙門中人，就用電話通知附近保衛團恊緝。果然，在武落寺小鎮上就破獲了，農夫們一面領了他們失而復得的耕牛，一面不住的讚嘆這德律風的神秘！</p>
<p>從上面的事實看起來，電話實在是建設農村工具之一。各縣已經辦過的應該設法擴充起來，務使綫路由星形的變成綱狀的。未辦的縣份，就應該趕辦。至於材料，侭可標買舊料，價格可以從廉。人員則以低俸吸收曾在各話局之退職份子，以資熟手。那末，鄉村電話，就輕而易舉了。</p>
<h3>輕短波長途無綫電話之成功</h3>
<p>— 頡</p>
<p>美國Ｗabc無綫電站之工程師與白爾德南極探險隊之輕短波長途無綫電話之試騐，業已成功。據Wabc機務主任柯漢君聲稱：一月六日晚，白爾德南極探險隊，在　Jaeob　Ｒuppeit船上，用一百二十瓦特之電力發出無綫電話，紐約Ｗabc完全接聽清晰。當試騐時，白爾德探險船已深入南緯七二度，西經一一七度之南極圈，距紐約約八千五百英里，而試話時所用之電力，僅等於二盞普通燈所用者。當KJTY（探險船呼號）正與紐約工程師用一千瓦特之電力，作短波測騐之時，變壓器忽然燒毀，及至修好復測，即發現此種電路所用最大之電力，實不能超過一百廿瓦特，至通話之成績，實與其他一千瓦特電力之電話相等。如此極小電力，而能作極長距離之清晰傳話，實爲任何人士所不及料云。</p>
<h3>廣擴無綫電台所用的遙控電話纜（二）</h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>近數年來，此種高周率的遙控電話纜，爲歐洲各國的廣播無綫電臺採用的，很不乏實例：即就德國西門子製造廠所設計製造的遙控電話纜，在各國裝用的，有如下述：</p>
<p>一一九二六年，與國首都維也納的廣播電臺，首先應用高周率的電話纜，以接通位置在該市中心區的音樂室，和在維城西南郊的播送臺。這電纜的心綫共計十對，除六對爲鄉村長途話綫及信號綫外，其他四對，均作廣播遙控之用，一對專用以傳送音樂節目，一對用爲試騐，尚餘二對爲預備綫。這四對的遙控綫，彼此之間，除用絕緣物外，再各用鉛質薄片，彼此屏障著，因此避免鄰近回路上發生的靜電誘導作用，使其不致受其影響。每一回綫，在相隔一千九百六十六公尺的距離處，更配裝十六米厘亨利（L6　milli-benries）的負荷綫圈一具：如此適當的負荷，可使回路內的周率，達到每秒一萬周。</p>
<p>二德國康納塞斯德享生（Konigswusterhausen）地方的郵政局，和在齊生（Zeesen）地方的播送臺中間，在一九二七年，亦裝用遙控電話纜一條，這遙控纜內，有一。二公厘（Ｍillimetre）的銅心綫三對，彼此用金屬套屏障著，各回路悉數加負荷裝置。每隔八百七十五公尺處，配裝一負荷綫圈，每圈有十六米厘亨利的誘導量，其周率，共得每秒一萬三千秒周。</p>
<p>三芬蘭海爾星福司（Ｈelsingfors），有一廣播言樂室，其播送臺，位置在其附近郊外，地名辣蒂（Ｌabti），兩地之間，傳送音樂節目，應用高周率的遙控纜，似很需要。在一九二七年冬，經德國西門子廠代其設計製造一遙控電話纜，內有心綫三對，彼此亦金屬屏障，配裝輕負荷；心綫均爲一公厘直徑的銅綫，負荷綫輪的誘導量爲十三米厘亨利，每隔一千公尺處，配裝一具，所有周率，約爲每秒一萬四千秒周。（未完）</p>
<h3>參觀香港無綫電台記（一）</h3>
<p>— 鄒茂桐</p>
<p>記者此次過港，曾由美國聯合無綫電公司華南代表培恩君之介紹，導往參觀香港無綫電臺。香港電臺係港政府所辦，到臺後晤其業務主任，工程師，及郵政總督，並參觀洪臺之中央收發室，計共費一小時有半。茲將該臺概況，略述如左：</p>
<p>一中央收發室的設備—中央收發室位在香港最熱鬧的中心區域，靠近郵局，門首懸有白底黑字長方玻璃招牌一塊。入門後，左面爲業務主任辦公室，及收報禮臺，櫃臺內則爲收報員，記賬員，派送班長，及派送員之辦公室。右面則爲報房。報房地位其狹小，尚不及上海電報局之無綫電報房。屋內設有鑿孔機二只，自動收報機二只，自動發報機五只，打字機十餘架，及信號放大器，Ｖ字機等件。所有港臺發往各處電報一律用自動快機。來往電報較多之電臺，如滬港問，設有專用鑿孔機一只，專打拍往上海報之紙條，經自動發報機拍機，報忙時另行增加。紙條打好後，即分送各機拍發，其自動快機，除通上海之機外，每架視其工作之閒忙，分別與二處或二處以上之電臺通報。至收報方面，則除通上海時，用自動收機外，其餘各處，仍用耳聽，惟一律用打字機抄收電報。基上所述，故港口發報方面，無須專人守值，任何各機，祇一收報員即可雙工工作，此其優點一。發報鍇誤較少，且錯誤一經發生，責任誰屬，易於判明，此其二。發報機得兼通數處，效率增高，此其三。兼通方法，係用一人專司發報事宜，坐在半圓桌中央，另派二三收報員，圍半圓桌而坐。每人守聽兩處電臺，以聽簡之二只，分別接聽二處電臺，如此一架發報機，可與五六虔通報，惟如實行此法，有三點須注意：一報務中必須先行練習，能用聽筒分聽二處，而祇收抄其中一處，不至發生錯誤。二發動機聲浪必須穩定，且所通報各臺，與發報臺的距離相等，如此所用波長，可無甚差異。此法祇能適用於來往電報較空閒之電臺，否則電報易遭躭誤。報房內所裝之自動收報機二只，除以一只與上海工作外，其餘一只用以自行校正自動快機之動作，另有“Ｖ”字機，備任何發報機在無報時，發“Ｖ”字記號之用，其爲便利。</p>
<p>二分收發處！港臺除中央收發室外，另設分收發處於九龍酒店，及香港皇后酒店附近，彼此間傳遞電報，一律用電報打字機。（Ｔeleprinter）（待續）</p>
<h3>電信與戰爭</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>在現代戰爭中，槍砲，炸彈，飛機，軍盤等等佔重要地位，但交通設備的完密與否，也很關重要。汽船，鐵道，公路，電信四者，是構成軍事交通的要素，倘使一個國家有精捕百萬，而無靈活完備的運輸設備和周密迅速的通信方法來調度他們，則軍事的勝敗，仍是把握不住的。關於汽船，鐵道，公路與軍事上的關係，不在本文範園之內，不必討論，我們現在且談談電信在戰爭時的重要性吧。</p>
<p>電信在戰爭上之效用，約有三端，曰：輔助空防：傳遞情報：指揮軍隊，茲分別說明如次：</p>
<p>一輔助空防在戰爭時，陣地或後方，隨時有被敵機飛來襲擊之虞，通常在戰地前綫，都配備防空哨以監視敵機之來往，而將所見報告於已方，但飛機的行動是非常迅捷的，報告的方法當然要格外迅捷，這自然有賴於電信的傳遞了。此外，在戰時，各處電報局或無綫電臺不論私人或國家的，見了敵機過境，必須將牠們的來去方向以及數目式樣立即報告關係方面，以便預爲防範。對於這件事已有許多國家，訂定很詳細的實施辦法。至於利用無綫電號飛機上通信，更有顯著的功效了！</p>
<p>二傳遞情報戰端一開，關於敵情的偵察極爲重要，所謂知已知彼，百戰百勝。近代戰爭中交戰國對於敵情之偵察，大都設立情報機關專司其事，把偵得的敵情，除尋常例行事項用書信報告外，對於較爲重要的情報，都利用公共電信機關來報告：有時用專設的秘密電臺：就公共電信機關傳遞情報時，大都用明語拍發而意思是別有所指，這樣才可以避免敵人的檢扣，</p>
<p>三指揮戰事電信在戰爭中所表現的最大的權威要算是指揮軍隊了，在戰爭時陣地的前後左右，都滿佈著電報電話無綫電組成的通信綱，藉以靈通戰情，傳佈號令：而全局的進退，大軍的調度，又往往運籌決策在數千里外，現在更有利用無綫電指揮飛機和軍艦的發明。這全是電信所發揮的效能。</p>
<p>電通交通在戰爭時既這樣重要，那麼那一種電信最適用於戰爭呢？這問題如同問海陸空三種軍備那一種最有用？同樣地不易作答：我覺得電話，無綫電報，有綫電報三種通信方式，在戰爭時各有優點，也各有缺點。電話的長處在乎問答逕捷，指揮者與被指揮者可明瞭戰情或決定進退攻守於俄頃，但有時敵方的間牒，往往會用種種方法，來偷佔話綫，以竊聽消息，甚至假藉話綫，僞造號令，指揮軍隊進退，使敵軍受創。這種事情在國際情報史上有很多的例子。至於無綫電無需敷設綿長的綫路，所佔面積微小，易於防護，機器輕便，易於移動，這幾點都是有綫電報所不及的，不過無綫電也有牠的最大的弱點，就是牠所發出來的電符，敵人可以竊聽。雖則拍的電報用以極複雜的密語綴成的，但敵軍中往往雇有專門研究密碼的人員，不難設法一一譯出，這不是最危險的事情嗎？說到有綫電例，雖說綫條長度，嫌牠遇長，時有受敵機敵艦轟炸切斷之虞，但對於通信秘密一層，雖較無綫爲可靠，而移動則較爲不便。現在歐美各國爲求戰爭時安全計，在各重要都市間大都將架空電綫已改爲地下綫，故防護方面已較前爲便利穩固，總之，有綫電，無綫電，及電話三者各有優點，也各有劣點，在戰爭時要相輔爲用不可偏廢。</p>
<p>至於到了戰爭爆發時，交戰國與中立國該怎樣管理電信事業？也是一個值得研究的問題。在戰時交戰國大都在全國總動員的號令之下，把本國的電信機關施行軍事管理，公衆雖仍可享受通信的權利，但到那時候這種工作，已不是電信機關的主要使命了。同時如果本國有與敵國接通的電信綫路，或是本國境，內設有敵國的過境綫路，都應全然割斷：此外，交戰國並設立電信檢查機關，專司檢查電信，所有來去及過境電報電話，除密語電報禁止傳遞外，明語電報語意雙關而含有疑義的，也在扣禁之列。如遇軍事緊急時，電信機關往往專發軍官電報，公衆通信，一概停止。明語電報所用語言，也有相當的限制。例如在歐戰時英國準用英法兩國文字，俄國準用俄，法，德，英四國文字，法國因國境與四鄰的關係上，除準用英，法，德，語外，並準用意，西，和，葡四國語言，但不準混合并用。我國文字用於電報上，因以號碼代替之故，雖係明語，國際間恒視爲密碼，戰時異常不便。至於中立國對於交戰國使用本國電報電話，得施行禁止或加以限制，倘認爲必要或有利的時候。再如發見通信的性質，含有幫助交戰國任何一方之戰門行爲，必履行禁止或限制的義務。</p>
<p>講到我們國家的電信設備，在戰爭在意識上看來，更覺得簡陋可憐了，邊遠各處的有綫電路，既年久失修，無綫電臺也未能充分建設，交部當局，年來雖注意及此，總因各方積欠軍官電費過鉅，經濟缺乏，不能咄嗟立辦。但仍在艱難困苦當中，竭其全力，逐漸地把邊境電信交通建設起來，去年迄今交通部對於此項工作，有相當的成績：但以國防的觀點來看，則我國現有電信設備相差尚遠，不但物質方面，當加以巨量的擴充，即人事方面，亦應加以充分的訓練和整理。但像現在這種各自爲政，胡亂建設，毫無整個計劃，總不是事。故第一步須先從統一而且強化中央的電信行政權入手，這是值得我們深切的注意的一個問題呵！</p>
<h3>問答欄（首都警察廳許康君問）</h3>
<p>關於詢問電信常識收發電報手續及有其他建議本社竭誠歡迎</p>
<p>（問一）電碼新編以外之字，如何譯碼拍發？</p>
<p>（答）電碼新編以外之字，其電碼可譯作近似之某字，再在附註欄內註明某字之旁加註某字。如陜西枸邑縣之枸字，爲電碼新編內所無，可在電文內譯作旬（二四八四）字，而在附註欄內，註明一句字加木旁。經電局調查發報人常用此字，即呈報交部，將此字編入新編內。</p>
<p>（問二）發報地或發報地無電信局之設置，而有長途電話可通者，如欲利用長途電話收發電報，則電文如何書寫？如何計費？</p>
<p>（答）長途電話，如係交通部所辦者，或與交通部簽訂接綫合同者，（如浙江省電話局）均可收發電報。否則因未訂合同，（如山東省長途電話）不能照辦。此項電報，按照郵轉電報書寫，普通電報收費。</p>
<p>（問三）擬請調查全國城市，共有街巷若干？將各街名縮爲一字，如電報掛號，加上門牌號碼一字，即以代替收報人住址，此種減省辦法，不知可否實行？</p>
<p>（答）此項辦法，曾有人建議，但經仔細考慮，有許多困難之處：一全國城市街巷太多，一一調查編號，殊不易易：二街巷名稱，常有變改，如用編號辦法，手續非常麻煩：三發報人檢查街巷名稱號碼，非練握有素，不易覓得：四收報局接到此項號碼，仍須譯成街巷名稱，電報不免稽延。至於省費辦法一節，自交通部今年頒行收人報人姓名住址在十五字以內作五字計費辦法以後，發報人盡可在十五字之內，將收報人姓名住址詳細註明，以免投送不到之彝，而報費權作五字計算，此項辦法，對於發報人，省費甚大，對於收報人，決無投送不到之理。近聞交通部通飭各電局如遇來報地名不知者，應就近向郵差訽明探送，似此服務週到，深得社會人士好感。</p>
<p>（問四）我國對日發電，可否在新編電碼上加註假名，以便通譯？</p>
<p>（答）我國對日本發電，經滬崎水綫及國際電臺Ｃgra者，（大北公司水綫除外）電碼可按照譯文次序，用七個數目字連成一組，仍照明語計費。此項辦法，我國僑民，便利實多。若編成日文假名，未始不可，恐反覺不便耳！</p>
<p>（問五）注音符號發電，能有可能希望否？</p>
<p>（答）交通部對於國音電報，向極熱心提倡。舊交部曾設立拚音電報研究會，規定國音電報法式及編訂國音電報彙編三種，并公布施行。十七年南京交通部成立後，即將此項彙編甲丙兩種，發交電信學校試用。旋據敎育部聲稱，以前項公布之汪音字母，與現行之注音符號新標凖，已多不同之點，不特聲韻有所變更，即符號亦有增減，該編係根據該部注意字母編成，自有修正之必要。交通部乃指派陳君彝煜負責修改，并將改正稿本送赴北平，商請國語統一籌備委員會詳加校閱，以期盡善，聞已校閱完畢，俟將全稿騰正，即可公布印行，并擬指定數局，先行試辦。</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>— 社友</p>
<p>招商經理公用電話　交通部爲便利城市民衆之通訊起見，特訂定部辦電話以用電話營業通則及招商經理公用電話通則兩種，凡設有交通部電話局之處，一律開放公用電話，除當地郵電局所一律裝設公用電話開放營業外，別由電話局招商經理公用電話，分代辦及包辦兩種，代辦者按電話局所定通話費價目收取，（每次三分至五分，視各地情形而定。）由局給予代辦費每次五厘至一分，每月至少給予二元。包辦者每月向電話局繳納包話費十元至二十元，其數目亦視各地情形而定，此項公用電話開辦後，民衆可隨時隨處通話，便利異常，前項通則可向各地電話局或本社索閱。</p>
<p>提前封發郵轉電報　凡當地未設電局之外，各郵局均可代收代送電報，此項電報稱爲郵轉電報，交部茲以各電局收到他處發來之郵轉電報，送交郵局用快郵遞寄時，往往因郵局辦公鐘點已過，不予收受，遲至次日始行收受發出，殊多延擱。故爲改良起見，特飭各郵局變通辦理，凡在對外營業時間以後封發郵袋之前，仍予接收趕班發，以資迅捷而免延擱云。</p>
<p>交部積極建設長途電話　交部前以各省民衆需要長途電話甚切，故已擬定江蘇省全省長途電話聯絡綱及九省長途電話綱兩計劃，積極進行建設。現以西蘭公路經委會業已督飭建築，將近完工，該兩地問長途電話亦極需要，故已派員建設，限明年二月間竣工通話，此後西北交通，當與東南各省同樣便利，國防上必獲益匪淺。又福建省福州至延平話綫，亦已開始建築，下月中即可竣工通話云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>自負</h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>我小時在人家私塾中讀書，先生敎我寫描紅簿，後寫印格，後寫脫格，後居然臨帖了。其時我頗自負，一若我的字比帖上遠好，很得意地把所寫的字，送請先生云抵評。不料繼先生抵閱之下，大吃某程咬金的橋子。我大爲失望，背後罵一聲，瘟先生不識好歹。</p>
<p>年稍長，又在另一家私塾讀書，先生敎我開筆，練習作文。先生困了一個衆進於勤一的題目。我絞盡腦汁，用盡心思，差不多費了三四個鐘頭的時間，做了二三百字的一篇大文。我自已讀簱，也十分得意。以爲董仲舒韓退之輩，也恐做不出來。又送到先生處請他批閱。</p>
<p>你道先生是什麼樣？先生把我的文字，約略看了一遍之後，掛下了面孔，捋一捋他的長鬚，歎了一口氣，說道：牽牛下井這種情形，我看了大爲沒趣。便知道我的佳作不對，因爲我的文章送給先生看後，我便偷偷地先看先生的面孔。假定先生的面孔，欣喜地觀察我的文字，或者竟吟唔起來，我這篇文字必定還好。假定先生的面孔不快活，或竟有憤怒的樣子，我的文字必定不佳，要大吃其排頭。這是學生們善觀氣色的一個秘訣，也是做學生的一種經騐。</p>
<p>但是我想，我的文章畢竟不差。大約是先生的不識貨，或者做的東西，不配先生的胃口，也未可知。後來這篇文字經先生批了出來，我急忙看他的批語，不是不堪造就便是臨表涕泣我便憤怒極了，要想去換一個識貨的先生，但是先生侭管換，排頭侭管吃。找來找去，竟找不到一個識貨的先生，贊揚我的文字。</p>
<p>後來我又與同邑學子去會文，不用說，殿軍的總是我。倘把全簿會文翻轉來看，倒是第一名。但是我總不服氣，又翻來拜讀拜讀第一名，第二名，第三名的佳作，自覺並不比我高明。於是我又罵衡文者瞎眼沒有衡文的資格。下次就不去會課了。大有舉世滔滔，竟沒有遇到一知已之感。</p>
<p>我憤極了，棄書不讀，又去學畫。學畫又頗自負，凡時下的畫，我總要批評他不對，不是說神韻不佳，便是批評他筆力不健，總批評他一個體無完膚，方才快意。但是我的畫呢。屢給友人去看，友人總是稱贊，說好，說大有進步。因此我又很得意地自負。但友人背了我，總是吃吃地作笑。</p>
<h3>生活圈外</h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>雪，狂飄著，飄到了屋上，田野，樹枝上……，在一個嚴冬的傍晚。</p>
<p>一個五歲的孩子，伏在別人家的屋簷下，用一把稻草蓋著顫抖的身子：雖然蓋了稻草，牙齒還是作對兒的廝打著，她身上僅僅穿了一身破的夾衣褲及一件小短衫。</p>
<p>北風絕對不會體恤到一個沒爹娘的孩子，仍舊肆虐地努號著！像一把尖妮，像一粒子彈，擊進了她幼弱的心靈，刺逼了她的週身，她更抖得利害了！</p>
<p>今年上半年，她還是一個有母親的孩子咧，雖然她父親在她出世後一月就死了。</p>
<p>五年的時光，是多麼的悠長啊；在半飢半鮑中過活的她的母親特別容易體會到。</p>
<p>牠父親死後，她母親將整個的願望寄托在牠身上了，每遇想起了她的父親而悲哀時，祇要一觀到她的笑臉，她母親便會幻出無數的光明：可不是嗎？她的女兒生得很漂亮，將來不難找到一個得意的，而且很有錢的丈夫，她——母親的後半世是用不到愁了。</p>
<p>數間破爛的茅屋，舊床，爛板凳，桌子及一些僅能遮體的舊衣，即她父親臨終時給她倆的遺產。</p>
<p>五年的生活，都是憑她母親十個指頭得來的，日以繼夜，夜以繼日，總算茍延殘喘到現在：雖然是在半飢半飽中度命。</p>
<p>也許是操勞過度，營養不足的緣故而致病了吧？她的母親就此一病不起，與世長辭了。</p>
<p>她母親臨死時她遠祇有五歲，不，祇四歲半！</p>
<p>她能否憶起她母親臨終的悲劇呢？豆似的火油燈的燈光，陰森森地，瀉滿酸臭氣十足的房間的每一個角落里，也瀉在垂斃人的臉上：兩眼深陷，太陽穴凹進，臉色如黃蠟般，十足地現出一個酤髏的形像來了。站在床邊的除了她以外，還有一個鄰家的老婦。</p>
<p>死了一個生身的親母，在四歲半的孩子幼小的心靈中並不會銘刻下悲哀的傷痕：有時雖也媽媽，媽媽的哭著，但那是在靜夜找不到母親及肚皮餓得不可開交時才會有的事。</p>
<p>從她母親死到現在已半年了！</p>
<p>半年的時光，在富人的頭上飛去了！也在窮苦孩子餓得發慌的心上慢慢地爬走了。</p>
<p>她天天討飯吃，起初，沈婆婆還給她一點殘羨冷飯，後來因她次數來得太多，也就討厭她了，不許她再進門，她現在已兩天沒有吃飯了。</p>
<p>飢餓的侵凌，使一個幼小的孩子失掉了康健，圓滿而又漂亮的臉孔，再也見不到了；接種而來的，祇有枯黃與瘦弱。</p>
<p>第二次，過年的日子哩！在某一家門前的稻草堆上，凍斃了一個女孩子。主人看見了盛氣地說；倒霉的窮鬼！偏在六年日尋著我，不知我碰到什麼兇煞，真是晦氣！又回頭對他的家人說；拋到中澗里去！</p>
<h3>東西南北</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>昨日某報本埠附刋載著別矣吾妻一信，是一個愛Χ吾妻出走之後，爲夫的陳Χ秋無錢登尋人廣告，乃在心亂如焚中，寫這封信的，如共鵠候無音，就要投浦自殺。</p>
<p>好像去年大晚報也有同樣的事件發生，後來結果如何，無從稽考，大概不甚樂觀吧。本來在經濟爲原則的社會中，餓了肚皮做恩愛夫妻是太神話的事情。既失業，又遇災，再付不出房錢，煮不出白粥，試問將過去的恩愛是否可以作今日之食糧？</p>
<p>許多人結婚了都直不起背脊，發牢騷時大有還我光棍之意，寄語陳君，這正是你再世做人的時候，愛妻等等，日後自會源源而來，留得青山在，不恤沒柴燒，做人要緊，死不得，快回頭！</p>

<h3>花</h3>
<p>留在　　中一樣，執了一束花那樣寂寞地　入行道上獨自走着，就是對於這束花的處置也完全忘了。彷彿一個久病的老人扶了手杖在公圜里散步，包圍著四周的景物，似乎感到從未有的驚奇，又好像都是習見般的厭惡，就那樣壞了一顆疲弱的心搬動著自已的身體向前走，其至忘了本身的存在。已經許多時候了，我被那樣的情形擺佈着。</p>
<p>一個難忘的記憶把我從夢中驚醒來，淡淡的秋陽，舞塲歸來的舞女似的，嬌懶地躺在我床前，我記著躺在另一張床上的人，她或者也已從夢中驚醒來，等候著探望她的朋友，沒有扣領帶，就披上秋大衣鎖了房門出來，彷彿那對黑的大眼球在我面前勾引一樣。</p>
<p>匆匆地踏進花店，從外國女郎早安聲中換來一束大麗花。我記得很好的，她有一個小小的書齋，案頭的膽瓶中永遠捕著那樣顏色的花朶，和她那對黑的大眼珠使人從心中感到異樣的調和。於是每一朶花蕊中嵌著她的大眼珠似的，我忘了乘電車，孤獨地走完悠長的路程。</p>
<p>在格式的紙上簽了名，一個白衣的女郎引我上三層樓甬道中靜悄悄地同修道院一樣，白衣女郎聖處女似的爲我推開了睡著等候她朋友來探望的房間的門。</p>
<p>白的床白的單被中間露著一對黑的大眼球，她太像夢中驚醒來的，甜密的微笑遺留在嘴角邊。我把大麗花挿在她床頭的瓷瓶中，被窗口吹進來的風撫摩著，大麗花微微含首，早安，主人！它說。主人笑著，揮了我的手，命我在床邊坐了。</p>
<p>家里來？黑的大眼珠注視著我的胸間。</p>
<p>沒有扣領帶？我說，可是大麗花帶來了。</p>
<p>謝謝你。半夜里我醒來，我夢見你……</p>
<p>把白的單被蒙住了黑的大眼珠，枕套窩里的頭髪被笑聲波動著。</p>
<p>我輕輕地搖著她的肩頭，麗，說，罷，是不是夢見我送大麗花來？</p>
<p>不！探起頭來，夢見你倒在別一個人懷中。</p>
<p>有這樣的事！</p>
<p>做夢啊！</p>
<p>一股勁坐起身來，俯頭吻著大麗花，我什麼時候出院？我真害怕呢！</p>
<p>一幅名貴的西洋畫似的笑了。</p>
<p>安心睡著罷，麗，不會有那樣子的事的，我好像已沒有了自已你忠實的僕人大麗花它能告訴你一切。</p>
<p>那對黑的大眼珠埋在花朶中。無語。</p>
<h3>現代學徒</h3>
<p>— 爾</p>
<p>有一次棲居在一家裁縫店的樓上當第一天搬進去的時候，看見樓下圍在一張長方桌子旁縫衣服的大小中間，兩個孩子的形態，特別擾亂了我的視綫。從此心里就印上了不良的暗影。後來每當從樓下經過的時候，總不免要仔細看他一看。</p>
<p>那對小孩，不知是生活的壓迫使他們不能好好的長大起來，還是年紀遠輕不到十歲。我彷彿從來沒有見過像這樣矮小瘦削的孩子！又那麼黑和髒—眼睛灰糊不清，四週又有些爛，塗上了些紅色。這就活像夜里亂夢中奇形怪狀的小鬼卒。有時我悄悄行近些細看，發覺了他們連目光向手上的動作看看也無力了，大約是眼睛疲痛得再不能用牠去看東西了，所以小針兒不住刺著他們的手，而亦只好忍著　　了這樣的孩子，誰不自暗呌一聲；天曉得呢！實在，這只有天才曉得，他們的生活呵！</p>
<p>時常在樓上聽見樓下的哭聲呌聲，我老不安的跑下來，那總是看見這兩個小孩子中有一個在地上打滾，手緊抱著頭，大哭大呌。主人拉上衣袖，咬緊牙根，揮動籐鞭痛打。好像孩子的哭聲是給他助興的音樂。非打到主人的氣力疲倦了是難以停止的。夜里，也很難數清我瘦孩子的哭聲驚醒的次數。我不能下去干涉，就只好呆聽，聽得我的心難堪得無可忍受。漸漸的，弄得我出入的時候，連看一看那對骷髏似的小孩都不敢了。但有時總會不覺就給我瞥見了。所以我終於不安於這樣的住所。</p>
<p>搬到了新居，見著有錢人家的小孩，那是多肥美活潑，我以爲稍得到了些解脫。但幾次經過較僻靜的地方，有些小鐵舖之類，店里面黑黑的鐵機器飛動底下，也同樣坐著不少渾身灰黑的小孩，在過著他們的現代學徒的生活。那是同樣的可怕！可憐呵！有一次又逢到去補皮鞋，主人約定隔天大清早就去拿。隔天大清早到店里時候，又是露現著一個小孩，和裁縫店里小鐵店里的一樣怕人，在拚命弄著皮鞋。在人失了約，好就掉在學徒的身上，登時拍拍的向孩子亂打。孩子卻還是埋頭動手，第一個巴掌剛停，他就繼續做，第二第三，都不息的做。但我清楚的看見孩子的涙在眼眶，四週打滾，我不禁十分偑服孩子的可愛！可是越覺可愛更覺其可憐。我把皮鞋拿走了，還聽見主人說不準他喝早粥。以後報紙上對於學徒的事情的登載，我總要細心看。但所苦過的多常常是說主人打傷或毆斃學徒。由這樣看來，現代的學徒生活是如何，就不問可知了。</p>
<h3>死前</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>生命，就等於一隻螞蟻存在於人間那麼渺小，自已亦不知能夠挨過幾多時日。然而壓在我渺小的生命的背膊上的生之災厄和生之苦難卻有著遠超過能力以上的重量。於是我的脖頸被壓得一天天的彎了下來。佝僂地喘息在荒漠無際的生的長途上，帶著有氣沒力的呻吟，掮著苦厄的重擔，走著長長的走不盡的道路，像駱駝在沙漠上走著，有著長長的日子了。在那些日子中，在我的眼底中，我瞧不見一個人，瞧不見一窩水，一株青色的草，白天太陽老躱在簇簇的島雲業里，因此白天連太陽也瞧不到，白天簡直變成了黑夜，黑夜里也從來不曾顯露過星星的閃影，月亮的銀輝，光有鬼魂似的冷風在慘呌著，此外一切都好像全毀滅了。宇宙真變爲無救的陰闇的黑穴。就只有我，一個生的零餘者，扶著殘破的心以及殘破的身子，不分夜，不分日，沒有光明，沒有幸福，更沒有歡情，寂寂地背著苦厄的重擔，走過長長的走不盡的長途。</p>
<p>送往一個霧夜，緊接著的又是一個更凄厲的雨夜，也曾回頭向後望望，望不到什麼，就是身邊剛剛走過的足印也已被揚起的應灰湮沒了。走著走著，生的苦厄的長途呵！</p>
<p>現在我的力氣已快磨盡，兩腿亦完全痙攀著，因此我倒在路旁了。雖然還能微微呼喘，但再也掮不起那生的苦厄的重擔了。我早知道生命是一杯滿滿的喝不完的苦酒，尚且是一個無窮盡的勞碌的段階。怎麼著也不會洋起星星的美麗的漪淪來。我更知道我的生就同於水波上一粒偶然浮出來的泡沫，自現自滅，原便用不著加以怎樣的珍惜。如今倒下來了，反能給我舒一口氣。雖說這時要正是到了最後的一剎那。可是我怕什麼呢？這只有災患沒有快樂的生的長途。既然是無聲無息的活到人陣里來，就讓他無聲無息地回去。不要驚動一片葉子，騷擾一隻酣睡的小島。像天上一朶雲，無端地從人僮的頭頂飛轉，又塊端的飛過。人們不曾留神，它自已亦不跟地面上發生任何牽連。我願我就在此時就在此地安靜的停止了吸呼，安靜地永遠躺在這里，泥土和塵埃自會給我蓋了堆成了家，說不定過些時偶然長起一根野草，那便算是最可貴的點綴吧，什麼碑銘對於我全沒用，我不希望。我的生，苦厄的生，也讓我一起帶回去藏在地下。不須要誰來把它宣讀。也許日後星星會伴著我，不然，就伴著流雲，流星里也有星星的閃眼哩！</p>

<h3>茶店</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>當我每天早晨踏進那片簡陋的小茶館時，幾隻怪熟的面孔又在我面前幌動了。—噢！吳先生你多早呵！可又來上街了？</p>
<p>他們嘴角上都不約而同的掛上了這末一句問安式的招呼；但不知他們對我還是恭維？還是敷衍？也許是敷衍吧！至於恭維是我不敢當的，並且我壓根兒也沒有值得他們恭維的地方。</p>
<p>—好—你們都早！</p>
<p>我不經意的對他們點了一下頭。</p>
<p>我自從到了這里，每天早上總要到這里來坐上兩個鐘頭的，非要把一個寂寞的早晨消磨過去不可。我雖不愛喝茶，但到了這里卻好像不喝不行的，所以終於把那滿壸滿壸的濃厚像血水般的紅茶，一盃一盃的往肚里倒，等到回去吃飯的時候，那壸濃得似血水的紅茶，已淡得彷彿像白開水，而一片一片的老茶葉，也像死魚一樣的直直的躺在壸底里了。</p>
<p>到這兒來坐上兩個鐘頭倒也合算，十二個銅子一壸茶，加上六個銅子一副大餅油條，總共不過十八個子兒，而整整的一個早晨卻好挨了過去。</p>
<p>假使到了雨天，那里更好，茶客是整天滿滿的：因爲許多農民爲著天雨而不能到田里，或上山地去工作，於是他們晴天疲倦了，就等待著這雨天來休息。麻將，挖花，笑話，灑食，便也打成了一片。</p>
<p>我來了這里二十多天，差不多沒有一天不到那小茶館里去的，不過有一樣使我最討厭，最憎亞的，就是那個癩痢頭堂倌。他那只似敲破竹頭的喉嚨，和聲聲悠悠長的呌喊；一身衣服是骯髒得令人見了作嘔，一股一股的大蒜頭氣味，直透進了我的鼻竅。然而他偏生是那末毫不知趣的要求和我搭訕的。</p>
<p>—吳先生—上海塲化真是天堂，你們在上海吃飯真是福氣……</p>
<p>—哦……</p>
<p>他侭管嘮哩嘮叨的講，但我卻沒有回答；我只將手帕堵住了口鼻，可也幾乎吐起來了。</p>
<p>不過聽聽幾位仁兄的高談闊論，倒也怪有味兒的。</p>
<p>他們所講的雖不是國際新聞或政治消息，可是關於農村現狀卻會自然而然的在他們嘴里流出來的。有時候，他們也談些風花雪月的事情。</p>
<p>而且還有許多農村社會的消息，都是他們實地訪來的，所以比報紙上登的這要可靠。</p>

<p>Peiping News from outside the pass indicates that the Japanese and puppet troops' offensive against the righteous army in the eastern counties has become increasingly fierce recently. On the morning of October 25th, over 300 members of the National Salvation Army in Xirong Lutou Village, Dongbian Road, engaged in a fierce battle with the 7th Regiment of the puppet 6th Brigade, led by Brigade Commander Komai. Although the National Salvation Army retreated, the puppet army suffered considerable casualties. On the 26th, the 3rd Company of the Infantry Regiment of the puppet 5th Brigade encountered the Korean Revolutionary Army in Changgangzi, 8th District, Ji'an. Both sides suffered a total of over 40 deaths. On the 27th, a team from the puppet Benxi County Police and the Xiaodianzi Self-Defense Corps engaged in battle with the righteous army led by Huang Xishan and went missing.

On the afternoon of the 28th, over 300 members of the righteous army in Chundibao, Qingyuan County, engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet police, commanded by Zhang Lianbi, the head of the puppet police station. The righteous army killed a puppet inspector and two puppet headmen on the spot. After the righteous army retreated, the puppet police, enraged, burned down over 60 civilian houses. The Eastern Comfort Bands dispatched by the puppet state to various eastern counties are divided into three groups. The first group went to Linjiang, Ji'an, and Changbai counties; the second group went to Xinbin, Huanren, and Tonghua counties; and the third group went to Qingyuan, Xi'an, and Dongfeng counties. Since their departure, they have all been unable to enter the counties due to the presence of righteous army defenses. They have all fled back to Shenyang in a disheveled state since November 27th.

Approximately 300 people attended, including presidium members Dai Chuanxian, Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Niu Yongjian, Wang Yongbin, and Lin Xiang; representatives from various central government agencies, including Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Wang Shijie, and Li Yuanding, totaling over eighty people; representatives from various local government agencies, including Shi Ying, Wang Tao, He Siyuan, Zhou Binglin, and Qi Zhenru, totaling over fifty people; representatives from various universities, including Luo Jialun, Hu Shi, and Liu Zhendong, totaling over ten people; experts Chen Lifu and Cheng Tianfang, totaling nine people; Central Committee member Shao Yuanchong; and other guests. After the meeting opened in the morning, the ceremony was held as usual. Dai Chuanxian, the chairman, delivered the opening speech, reporting on the Examination Yuan's past achievements in the examination and selection system. He stated that the examination and selection system is a major principle of the country, and that whether all laws and regulations can be applied perfectly during implementation should be carefully and thoroughly considered. Therefore, this conference was convened, inviting all officials to attend for comprehensive planning. He hoped that everyone would express their opinions and research to perfection, which would be fortunate for the country. Next, Wu Jingheng, the representative of the Central Executive Committee of the KMT, delivered an admonitory speech, briefly stating that examination is one of the five powers of the constitution. The country's organization should follow a logical order. The National Government is the highest authority, establishing laws and regulations. The Legislative Yuan enacts laws, and the Executive Yuan exercises political power. The Examination Yuan selects talented people who can fulfill their duties. Therefore, examination is the fundamental source of talent for the country, and examination and selection are closely related to all administrative organs in the country. China's examination system has thousands of years of history. If we can select the virtuous and appoint the capable, divide labor and govern, so that all those employed can fulfill their duties, the country will benefit infinitely. Then, Deng Jiayan, the representative of the National Government Chairman, delivered an admonitory speech, briefly stating that Chairman Lin is currently in Shanghai and specially sent him to participate in the examination, which is one of the five powers of the constitution proposed by Sun Yat-sen. Through the years of efforts and creation by Chairman Dai, it has taken shape. This conference has now been convened, and all participating representatives are knowledgeable, experienced, and able to research to perfection, so that everyone can use their talents. He expressed infinite hope. Next, Education Minister Wang Shijie delivered a speech, briefly stating that he hoped that all participating representatives, who have extensive powers of employment, would discuss problems in large quantities and concentrate on one or two important issues. Finally, music was played, and the ceremony was completed. A photo was taken in front of the Mingzhi Building. Afterward, all personnel went to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum outside Zhongshan Gate, where Chairman Dai Chuanxian presented a wreath, and everyone respectfully read the memorial text. The chairman led all representatives to respectfully bow once inside the tomb gate, circled to the right to the tomb gate, bowed once inside, and returned to their positions. Finally, another commemorative photo was taken in front of the tomb. (1st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanjing At noon on the 1st, all representatives of the National Examination and Selection Conference gathered for a meal at the Examination Yuan. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the first general assembly was held. Dai Chuanxian was absent due to business, and Niu Yongjian, the vice president of the Examination Yuan, chaired the meeting. After performing the ceremony as usual, Wang Yongbao, the secretary-general of the conference, reported that 159 people were present and 33 people were attending, for a total of 192 people. A total of 88 proposals had been received by October 31st. The chairman reported the list of members of the proposal review committees for the selection and appointment categories designated by the presidium. Then, the 28 agenda items set for the 1st were discussed. It was passed that all proposals should be submitted to the proposal review committees for review before being submitted to the general assembly for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. The proposal review committees of the two categories continued to meet separately. The selection category was divided into three groups to review 11 proposals, and the appointment category was divided into four groups to review 17 proposals. It was decided to hold the second general assembly on the morning of the 2nd. In addition to reporting items, the agenda included discussing 43 proposals. (1st, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Criminal Law in Third Reading</h3>
<p>Kyoto Women's Relief Association's Request for Reconsideration Rejected</p>
<p>Nanjing The Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 2:30 PM on the 1st, with sixty committee members, including Zhao Naichuan, attending. Sun Ke chaired the meeting. Representatives from the Kyoto Women's Relief Association also attended as observers. After the meeting was announced, Secretary-General Liang Hancao read a petition from the Kyoto Women's Relief Association, mainly requesting that Article 234 of the amendment be reconsidered in accordance with the principle of gender equality stipulated in the party platform. The committees believed that the bill had been carefully discussed and revised by the general assembly before it was passed. If a reconsideration is granted simply because someone submits a petition, this precedent would lead to endless reconsiderations. They all believed that reconsideration should not be granted. Since the motion was rejected, the women observers quietly left the venue. Then, the third reading of the criminal law began, with secretaries Chen Haicheng and Kang Shiwei taking turns reading. By 5:05 PM, it was all read. Except for changing "Anluoyin" to "Heroin," "commercial registration" to "commercial registration," adding the word "er" to Article 118 "foreign openly," and modifying the order of other articles, it was all passed according to the second reading. After the third reading, the criminal law had a total of 357 articles, 29 fewer than the current criminal law and 7 more than the amendment. The number of articles also changed due to additions. After the third reading was completed, it was unanimously passed without dissent. Then, the issue of promulgation and implementation was discussed. The committees believed that after the criminal law is promulgated, all special laws of a similar nature should be repealed to unify the criminal law. The chairman submitted it to the Criminal Law Committee for review. The meeting was adjourned at 5:15 PM. (1st, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Outlook on the Saar Problem</h3>
<p>— Ting.</p>
<p>The Saar problem, which has been delayed for fifteen years, is nearing the date of the plebiscite and is rapidly deteriorating, causing great anxiety among people around the world. According to the French Foreign Ministry, French troops near the Saar have made complete preparations and are ready to depart at any time. If the German National Socialist Party implements its original intention of returning the territory with strong-arm tactics, the French army will not hesitate to take decisive action and open the border within the Saar region to maintain the rights stipulated in the treaty. It is recalled that two months ago, former US Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Pearson, returned home after inspecting Europe and reported to President Roosevelt, stating that the Saar problem was more serious than other European issues. The plebiscite contains latent crises and should not be taken lightly. If Germany and France unfortunately take extreme measures on this issue, the resulting disaster will be truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, the Saar mining area has been managed by an administrative commission established by the League of Nations Administrative Council. The original deadline was fifteen years, after which a plebiscite would be held to determine whether the area should maintain its current status or be merged with Germany or France. According to this provision, the plebiscite will be held in 1935, and the exact date will be decided by the League of Nations Administrative Council. On June 3 of this year, representatives from France, Germany, and Italy reached a decision after repeated consultations, deciding that the earliest date stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles (i.e., January 13, 1935) would be the voting day, and this was formally approved by the Administrative Council. However, the eligibility of voters has been challenged for as many as 100,000 to 130,000 people, and it will take a long time to review them one by one. It is expected that this cannot be completed before the final deadline of November 9, so the voting date will inevitably be postponed. The final deadline of the 9th is approaching in an instant, and the postponement of the vote is unavoidable. Hitler has always regarded the unconditional recovery of the Saar as a benchmark. He has endured until now only because of his lack of strength. However, he has always regarded the administrative commission stationed in the Saar by the League of Nations as a rule and has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction. If the voting date is postponed, it will give Hitler another excuse to curse the League of Nations. On January 16 of this year, a Reuters dispatch from Geneva stated that local people believed that if the decision to postpone the vote was made, Germany would definitely take special actions. Now, looking at the French's serious preparations, it is enough to prove that this statement is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, judging from the attitude of the Saar citizens, the outcome of the future vote is also difficult to predict. This voting right does not distinguish between gender or nationality. Anyone who is 20 years old on the voting date and has resided in the Saar region since June 28, 1919, can enjoy it equally without any discrimination. However, according to common sense, the vast majority of the 800,000 people in the Saar are of German descent, so a German victory can be predicted. Why worry so much and show such a lack of generosity? What is not known is that the content of this matter is complicated and cannot be conclusively determined based on simple speculation. Many Socialists and anti-Hitler elements in the Saar fear that their lives will be endangered after the merger, so they would rather maintain the status quo and oppose the movement to return to the soil under Hitler's leadership. For example, the Central Party, which has the largest force in the region, and the Communist Party, which has the second largest force, have both raised the banner of opposition to Hitler. The Communist Party's attitude is particularly firm. The party leader issued a proclamation as early as early June of this year, ordering all party members to vote to maintain the current system. This move is no small blow to Hitler's movement.</p>
<p>The German government, in view of this, has repeatedly stated that it will not exert any direct or indirect pressure on the voters and will not take retaliatory measures regardless of the voters' attitude. However, the Central Party and the Communist Party have suffered greatly from the destruction of the National Socialist Party and have deep grievances. Even if there are sweet words and secret promises, how can they easily believe them? Moreover, the French are manipulating from within, deliberately making connections, and the extent of their influence is beyond the knowledge of outsiders. The French know that their hope of returning the Saar is extremely slim. As a fallback, it is better to maintain the status quo. On the one hand, they can continue to mine coal in the Saar to meet the needs of their own country. On the other hand, they can limit Hitler's political power and avoid affecting the overall situation in Europe due to the Saar issue. Therefore, the crux of the Saar issue in the future lies in whether to return to Germany or maintain the status quo. Maintaining the status quo is advocated by the French, so it is still nothing more than a dispute between France and Germany. If Hitler lacks the certainty of victory in next year's plebiscite, he may recently take the postponement of the vote as an excuse and attempt to realize his special actions. At this point, the French will naturally use force to restrain him and re-enact the story of sending troops to the Ruhr. With both sides accumulating resentment and refusing to yield, the brewing of a European war will inevitably become more mature. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Reception for Overseas Chinese Representatives by the Central Propaganda Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Several dozen representatives of overseas Chinese who have returned to the country to attend the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang have registered one after another.

<h3>General Progress in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Moscow: As the Soviet elections are approaching, the Soviet Union has listed the achievements in various aspects of socialist construction as follows: Pig iron production was 13,000 tons in 1930 and has increased to more than 30,000 tons this year. A total of 9,000 tractors were manufactured in 1929 and 1930. Currently, 90,000 tractors can be manufactured annually. Automobile production was 2,000 vehicles in 1930, but today 72,000 vehicles can be manufactured annually. In recent years, the foundation of the collective farming system has been greatly strengthened. In 1930, there were 158 machine tractor stations in the country, which have now increased to 3,500. At present, state-owned and collective farms have a total of more than 250,000 tractors. The seven-hour work system has been adopted throughout the Soviet Union, and unemployment has disappeared. The total wage and social insurance funds have tripled, so the living standards of the working class have greatly improved. At present, compulsory primary education is implemented throughout the country, and the number of literate people has increased from 67 percent in 1930 to 92 percent this year. The number of newspapers sold nationwide has increased from 1,500,000 copies to 30,000,000 copies. (TASS dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Moscow: As the Soviet elections are approaching, newspapers are summarizing the achievements of municipal construction in the Soviet Union in recent years. The urban population of the Soviet Union was estimated at 27,400,000 in 1929, but now it is 40,000,000. In the past three years, 30 new cities have been built across the country. More than 140 waterworks have been added to Soviet cities since the revolution. Although the daily water consumption has tripled, the length of the irrigation canals has increased four and a half times. In recent years, 24 cities have added electric railways. In 1914, there were a total of 91,500,000 tram passengers in Russia, but in 1933, there were 200,000,000 in Moscow alone. The cost of housing construction from 1931 to 1933 was more than 360,000,000 rubles. During the same period, 580,000 new houses were added, with a living area of 21,000,000 square meters. Other urban construction projects underway this year (from small bathrooms and clothing rooms in workers' cities to the Moscow subway) also number in the thousands. In recent years, many urban construction facilities have been added, such as theaters, clubs, public gardens, sports fields, cultural palaces, and a large number of trees. Therefore, the appearance of Soviet cities has changed dramatically. (TASS dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Russia Meets the Japanese Emperor</h3>

<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Declares Determinedly to Actively Strengthen the Navy</h3>
<p>Adding 42 warships of various types</p>
<p>Also building large military and civilian airships</p>
<p>Also increasing naval personnel by several thousand</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared today that regardless of the outcome of the London talks, the US Navy will build up to its full strength as permitted by the treaty. When the Secretary made this uncompromising statement, he also stated that the Navy would request the next Congress to allocate funds to build a total of 42 warships of various types, and that naval personnel would also need to be increased by several thousand next year. The current US Navy has a total of 82,500 people, which will probably increase to 88,000 or 93,000 in the next three years. The strength of the air force will also be greatly strengthened. Currently, people seem to be paying attention to the development of large airships again. Mr. Swanson also said this morning that the Navy will cooperate with Dr. Eckener, the famous pilot of the Zeppelin airships, to demonstrate the flight of the new Zeppelin LZ-129 in the summer of next year. Commander Rosendahl, the Navy Department's airship expert, also suggested to the Federal Aviation Investigation Committee today that two military and passenger airships should be built. (National News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>New York: Rear Admiral Stirling, commander of the US Navy Shipyard, advocated that the United States should establish a larger navy and merchant fleet. Mr. Stirling stated today that we must be able to rely on a satisfactory fleet based in areas where wars may occur and rely on a satisfactory fleet of soldiers and officers based in areas where wars may occur, and rely on a large, modern merchant fleet to manage most of our country's foreign trade and to serve as an auxiliary force for the fleet in emergencies. According to a dispatch from Washington, Secretary of the Navy Swanson is now urging President Roosevelt and the Budget Bureau to increase the number of naval warriors during the 1936 fiscal year so that the naval warriors can reach a maximum of 93,000 by June 30, 1936. The current number of naval warriors is only 82,500. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Impasse in Naval Negotiations</h3>
<p>US-Japan Talks Last Two Hours</p>
<p>Still End Without Results</p>
<p>London: The London Naval Talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan are currently in turbulent waters due to Japan's demand for naval equality. Diplomats from the three countries are working hard to find a basis for continuing the talks. However, according to sources responsible for the US side, the representatives of the US and Japan met for two hours today but failed to make any progress in the discussion of the Japanese proposal. The meeting discussed Japan's ideal total tonnage and its views on weapons for self-defense and aggression. However, the US representatives ultimately failed to agree with the meaning of the common high limit stated by the Japanese representatives, such as Yamamoto. The Japanese side said that they do not intend to build warships directly to the common high limit. The reason why they demand equality is entirely a matter of face, but it is also mostly a matter of face. The US side does not agree with the Japanese claim that the island nation of Japan is not in an equal position with Britain and the United States in the Pacific Ocean, because the strength of naval power depends on the needs of the country. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>US Side Raises Profound Questions</h3>
<p>Both Sides Still Maintain Their Original Positions</p>
<p>London: The US-Japan meeting on the 31st was originally scheduled as a private meeting between Ambassador Matsudaira and Representative Davis, but then the US delegation informed the Japanese delegation that all members would attend, so it was changed to a formal meeting. The meeting began at 4:30 pm. Representative Davis spoke first, questioning the Japanese government's new disarmament policy. Then, Representative Yamamoto and Admiral Standley began a fierce discussion. Admiral Standley opened up the American opinion on the following points: 1. The Japanese new disarmament policy, which decides the common maximum amount of naval power for all countries, is nothing more than the total tonnage doctrine. The US government cannot agree. 2. Distinguishing between offensive and defensive weapons has no technical basis. 3. Japan claims that Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States are not in an equal position, but naval power can be determined by what each country needs and the nature of the problems each country faces. The United States cannot recognize Japan's claim. Admiral Standley is, after all, the Minister of War, and his questions were profound and specific. The questions and answers of insiders failed to change the original position technically, and the negotiations still made no progress. The meeting began to disperse at 6 pm. (Nippon Rengo dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Conceal Its Fraud</h3>
<p>Claims the US Does Not Abandon Its Policy of Aggression in the Far East</p>
<p>Tokyo: The confrontation between the US and Japan in the preliminary disarmament negotiations is gradually escalating. The US delegation has stated that it cannot accept Japan's new proposal at all. The Japanese Navy believes this is extremely regrettable. Their general views are as follows: In short, the US and Japan negotiations are about Japan's claim to establish a principle of not feeling threatened and not invading. The US side is completely incompatible with this and is in complete opposition to the US Navy's traditional policy of the Eastern Expeditionary Army. The right and wrong of this are very clear. We firmly believe that world opinion will gradually show goodwill towards Japan. However, at this juncture, the US side is advocating its Pacific defense strengthening and new shipbuilding plan, and is making counter-propaganda that runs counter to the spirit of disarmament. However, this situation is probably the unreasonable behavior of a few people and is definitely not the public opinion of the entire US people. Thinking of this, it is extremely regrettable.

<h3>Britain Hosts a Banquet for US and Japanese Representatives</h3>
<p>MacDonald Toasts for Friendship</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister MacDonald hosted a banquet this afternoon for the US and Japanese delegations attending the preliminary naval talks. The British guests included Lord President of the Council Baldwin, Foreign Secretary Simon, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, First Sea Lord Chatfield, Chief of the Naval Staff Riddell, Head of the American Department of the Foreign Office Craigie, Sir Howard, Japanese guests included Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira, Chief Delegate to Naval Talks Rear Admiral Yamamoto, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy Sato, and other naval personnel. The American guests included Ambassador to the United Kingdom Bingham, Chief Delegate to Naval Talks Davis, Chief of Naval Operations Standley, Counselor of the Embassy in the United Kingdom Atherton, Colonel Anderson, Rear Admiral Pye, Captain King, and Lieutenant Commander Tuckwell. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>London: The Japanese side is demanding a common upper limit of possession based on the principle of equal armament rights, and the American side is demanding the Washington Treaty based on the principle of relative naval power. Although the Japanese side has clarified the numerical content, it is difficult to accommodate, and technical compromises are difficult to reach. Therefore, the British side, on the one hand, wants to assist in the establishment of the Washington Treaty, and on the other hand, wants to use political means, such as the precedent of limiting the Pacific defense agreement, to reconcile the opposition between the US and Japan. Judging from the current state of the talks, this is considered the most appropriate method. However, the Japanese side believes that introducing political issues is contrary to the nature of the naval conference. On the other hand, it is speculated that if only the UK, US, and Japan are involved, it is inevitable that uncontrollable problems will arise. Therefore, the future of the talks is becoming increasingly complex. As for the overall talks, the repeated debates between Yamamoto and Standley require agreement on non-technical aspects. It is noteworthy that the three countries have reached a consensus on this. (Den Tsushin dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Mystery of Roosevelt's Long Talk with Stimson about the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt stated this morning that he discussed world affairs with Secretary of State Stimson, who served under Hoover, last night. However, the President was unwilling to disclose which specific issues were discussed at their long meeting. According to outside speculation, it was probably related to the London talks, and the President wanted to know the background of US-Japan relations. Mr. Stimson also only said that he discussed ordinary international affairs and was unwilling to make any further comments. After consulting with Mr. Stimson, the President summoned Mr. Hornbeck, head of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, and several other key officials from the State Department's Treasury Department who had recently handled trade and tax negotiations to the White House for a meeting.

<p>Tokyo: The total amount of the next year's budget reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Finance conference is 2.023 billion yuan, and the estimated revenue is 1.41 billion yuan, leaving a shortage of 600 million yuan, which will be made up for by issuing deficit bonds. In that case, the total amount of Japanese bonds for the next year will exceed 9 billion and will reach 10 billion yuan. (Nippon Rengo dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Democratic Party President Wakatsuki Resigns</h3>
<p>Machida Has the Highest Call for Succession</p>
<p>Tokyo: The resignation of Democratic Party President Wakatsuki has been unanimously advised by the party's executive committee to withdraw his resignation and make every effort to retain him. However, Wakatsuki's will was firm and he was unmoved. As a result, starting at 3:00 pm on the 1st, a general affairs meeting was convened. Wakatsuki declared at the meeting that he had taken over as president from Mr. Hamaguchi, and after detailing the situation at the time and his recent recollections, he stated that even if he left his post, he would still work harder than ever from a free standpoint as a party member and a member of the public, and expressed his intention to resign. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, stated that if Wakatsuki's decision was absolutely unchangeable, it would nominate Mr. Machida to succeed as president. If Mr. Machida agrees, a joint meeting of members of both houses and councilors will be convened within the next day or two to resolve the matter as soon as possible. However, Mr. Machida is also unwilling to succeed as president, so this case is being given great importance. At this time, there is no one else suitable besides recommending Kawatsuki Takukichi. The Democratic Party is planning to resolve all issues within the next two days and is very busy. (Nippon Rengo dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Expansion Turns Tokyo into an Industrial Zone</h3>
<p>Workers Increase by 15%, Production Increases by 30%</p>
<p>Tokyo: The political capital of Tokyo is about to become the industrial Tokyo. Since Showa 7, riding the waves of military expansion, Japanese industry has continued to leap forward, and its momentum is extremely advanced. According to a survey by the Statistics Section of the Ministry of Interior, it is believed that the development of heavy industry and chemical industry in the Tokyo area is considerable, even surpassing Osaka, which has always been touted as the first industrial zone in East Asia, and ranks first. The content of the survey is roughly as follows: From the eighth year to the present, there are a total of 38,605 factories with five or more employees, an increase of 2,975 from the previous year.

<p>London: Sir Sassoon, Undersecretary of Aviation, returned here today after flying to Singapore. He said that he paid special attention to the development of airfields and landing fields on the air route between India and Singapore. The Ministry of Aviation has been planning sky commercial transportation for many months, and it has now been decided that flight times must be greatly reduced. He often landed at night and felt that night flight would soon become a practical method. He had talked with Singaporean personnel and was convinced that the difficulties in expanding the Imperial air business from Singapore to China could be eliminated. He expected that the aviation business to China would eventually be realized. He was very pleased that the British aircraft and British engine won the championship in the British-Australian air race, and the performance of the Douglas aircraft used by the Dutch aviator was also commendable. However, he felt that they could not say that the time had come when aircraft that were regularly dispatched could have a speed of 100 miles per hour in any weather.

<h3>British Newspaper Praises China's Stable Situation</h3>
<p>Related to the Whole World</p>
<p>London: The Times published an editorial in its financial supplement, stating that the recovery of China's commercial prosperity and political stability will not be delayed any longer. This is a fact related to the whole world. Judging from the recent situation of China's import trade, it is obvious that China is seeking to increase its domestic production to meet its domestic needs. Chinese domestic products are increasing daily, and their prices are lower. British manufacturers must prepare themselves and change their plans to adapt to China's needs. As China's prosperity increases, the demand for refined goods will inevitably increase. British factories in Lancashire and Yorkshire are best suited to supply refined goods. Therefore, the prospects for trade with China must be very promising. The policy of cultivating Chinese technical talent in Britain should be promoted and expanded on the existing scale, which will be of no small benefit to Sino-British cooperation and the future of trade. Britain cannot prevent China from developing into an industrial country, but if Britain can assist China in its efforts to produce, Britain will be able to occupy a large part of the profitable trade with China.

<p>London: The Financial News published an editorial stating that it is extremely difficult to determine how Chinese currency will evolve in the future. However, once the morbid outflow of silver ends, the decline in Chinese currency and the contraction of currency reserves will be alleviated. If the difference between Chinese currency prices and foreign currency prices is not too great, foreign capital inflows into China will inevitably increase daily. From this point of view, although China's future may not be very bright, it should not be considered completely hopeless. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Japan's Diplomatic Authorities Baffled by Soviet Russia's True Intentions</h3>
<p>Response to the Publication of Documents by Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Tokyo: Just as Guangtian [Hirota] and Yulenev [Yurenev] were holding talks over the transfer of the Middle East Railway for the past two days, proceeding in an extremely friendly manner, the Soviet government suddenly issued an official statement on the 31st, publishing the details of the negotiations, claiming that the delays were due to Japan's stubborn and obstinate attitude. Japanese diplomatic authorities have issued the following unofficial remarks regarding this matter: While they are not at liberty to disclose the content of the negotiations at this time, the Soviet Union suddenly issued a statement blaming Japan for the stalled negotiations even as Mr. Guangtian [Hirota] and Mr. Yulenev [Yurenev] were making satisfactory progress. It is exceedingly difficult to understand the true intentions of the Soviet Union. It is possible that the Soviet side had domestic or international reasons to adopt such an attitude, but it is impossible to ascertain the reason. (1st Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency)</p>

<h3>France Deploys Troops on the Border in Preparation for the Saar Incident</h3>
<p>Two Army Divisions Ready to Enter the Powder Keg at Any Time</p>
<p>League of Nations Administrative Council Scheduled to Meet on the 21st of This Month</p>
<p>Geneva: The situation in the Saar region suddenly became tense today in the eyes of the League of Nations, as reports here state that France has notified Britain that it has stationed heavy troops in the Nancy area in preparation for an invasion of the Saar if necessary. It is claimed that the Sixth and Twentieth Army Corps have been concentrated in Nancy and can enter the so-called European powder keg upon order. It is widely rumored here that France has notified Britain that these troops have been placed under the command of the League of Nations' Saar region chief, Knox, as a preventive measure against any uprising by the National Socialist Party in the region. It is expected that French Foreign Minister Laval will reiterate the declaration made by the late Foreign Minister Barthou at the Administrative Council meeting on September 27th when he attends the Saar region administrative meeting on November 19th, namely that France can assume very special responsibilities in the Saar region. The Saar region plebiscite is scheduled to be held on January 13th next year, at which time the people will decide whether the region belongs to Germany, France, or remains under the administration of the League of Nations.

<h3>France Contacts Britain</h3>
<p>London: According to a diplomatic expert of the Daily Telegraph today, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin went to the British Foreign Office on Tuesday and obtained assurances that Britain would not oppose the entry of French troops into the Saar region if necessary. (1st National Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: A spokesman for the French government officially denied to the Associated Press today the claim that French troops planned to march into the Saar region. Notifying Britain, the spokesman admitted that the French army had dispatched troops, stating that if the German National Socialist Party rose up in the Saar region, the army could be mobilized within two hours. However, he absolutely denied notifying Britain on this point. (1st National Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>France's Statement</h3>
<p>Paris: According to foreign sources, the French military authorities will take the necessary measures so that they can respond when the Saar Administrative Committee requests assistance. This news should be corrected as necessary, because France is determined to implement the Saar vote procedure strictly in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles in a clear and open manner. When the people vote, they should be allowed to freely express their opinions, and France has no intention of interfering. Even if French military force is needed due to police measures, the French army can only act when fulfilling France's international obligations or upon receiving a formal request from the Saar Administrative Committee. The so-called international obligations refer to the French obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Administrative Council resolutions of 1925 and 1926. As for the Saar Administrative Committee, it is an international organization that is responsible to the League of Nations for maintaining order and protecting the lives and property of the Saar people at all times. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany's Reaction</h3>
<p>Berlin: The public and political circles here are showing extreme shock at the reports from Paris and London that French military authorities have decided to complete their defense plan as soon as possible for fear that a German attack on the Saar would endanger French territory. According to French newspapers, the German attack on the Saar is scheduled for the end of January next year after the public vote, at which time the German army will enter the Saar and present the League of Nations with a fait accompli. According to the London Times, the French government has instructed the generals stationed near the Saar to be on alert at all times so that when the Chairman of the Saar Governing Committee, Mr. Knox, needs the assistance of the French army, the French army can deal with it smoothly without being flustered. These reports are quite shocking here. Today, the semi-official German news agency issued a statement on the matter, stating that such reports are likely to cause extreme unease in Germany and the Saar region, because the French military preparations are quite likely to take arbitrary steps by taking advantage of this, and are intimidating enough to influence the voting results. The German government and people have no demands on the Saar issue, but hope that they can conduct their voting procedures in a calm and fair manner so that the future of the Saar region can be decided by the will of qualified voters. However, if a directly related party is allowed to carry out its military operations freely in the Saar region, it will not only violate the spirit of the public vote but also violate the provisions of the treaty, and the so-called military intimidation almost refers to this. The statement concludes by expressing the hope that the people of the Saar region will not be moved by various conspiracies and provocations, but must maintain order and wait for January 13, 1935, when they can declare their intention to return to their homeland to the world so that other parties have no excuse.

<h3>Saar Espionage Case</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken: The Merzig Higher Regional Court today sentenced the defendants in the Lauchingen espionage case. Laske, a factory guard at the Lauchingen factory, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Four other Germans in the Saar region were also sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half to five years respectively. The entire city was outraged and disturbed. The Saar newspaper reported that Laske was lured into French territory after receiving a fake telegram, which led to his arrest on espionage charges. However, the Merzig court was unable to present evidence. Such actions seem unfair, almost like the French military tribunals during the Great War. Furthermore, Germans in the Saar region will not be able to live in harmony with the French because the Saar people's vote for self-determination affects all Germans. The German Front claimed that this action is nothing less than a violation of the guarantee treaty signed between Germany and France. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hitler Expresses Non-Interference in Church Affairs</h3>
<p>Suspended Bishops Reinstated</p>
<p>Berlin: The situation of the German Christian Church has suddenly changed. The National Church has now lost the patronage of Führer Hitler. Yesterday, after meeting with Bishops Köschel and Wurm of Bavaria and Württemberg, Herr Hitler issued a declaration stating that the government and the National Socialist Party do not wish to interfere in purely religious matters. Herr Hitler also agreed with Interior Minister Frick to send Internal Affairs Director Bertmann to mediate between National Bishop Müller and Meo. In addition, a pastor of the Evangelical Church announced to a crowd of 5,000 people at a celebration of the religious reformation tonight that Bishops Meissel and Wurm would be officially reinstated tomorrow. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: Since Führer Hitler declared that the government and the National Socialist Party do not wish to interfere in purely religious matters, rumors have spread that the head of the National Church, Bishop Müller, has submitted his resignation.

<p>Berlin: Today, 4,000 Christians gathered at Berlin's largest dance hall, the Marble Hall, to hear Dr. Niemöller, a famous submarine captain during the war, announce that Bavarian Bishop Meiser and Württemberg Bishop Wurm would be reinstated tomorrow. The crowd cheered incessantly. Both bishops are leaders in opposing the National German Church and were recently suspended by National Bishop Müller. Wurm was even deprived of his freedom, with police stationed outside his bedroom door. This action angered Wurttemberg's parishioners. After the news of the suspension of Bavarian Bishop Meiser was announced, they openly revolted against Müller. The public believes that the reinstatement of the two men is a direct result of the church delegation's visit to Hitler yesterday. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Austria Implements New Corporatist Constitution</h3>

The constitution also stipulates the organization of a Federal Parliament, composed of 59 representatives elected by the above four chambers. The government has the right to submit any bill rejected by the Federal Parliament to a public referendum. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>A Senior Official of the Ministry of Finance Discusses the Reform of the Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>The Process and Thoughts</p>
<p>Nanjing: In order to rectify tax collection, eliminate malpractices, benefit the national treasury, and benefit businesses and the people, the Ministry of Finance has specially begun to use new stamp tax stamps starting today, which are sold by post offices on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. Today being the day of the implementation of the stamp tax reform, a Central News Agency reporter visited a senior official of the Ministry of Finance in order to make the public understand the reform process. According to him, the Ministry of Finance's implementation of new stamp tax stamps and changing the sales method is on the one hand to eliminate malpractices and rectify national tax collection, and on the other hand to facilitate sales so that businesses and the people can freely purchase them, and the government and the people will both benefit. However, there is one issue that businesses and the people should understand clearly during the implementation of the new stamp tax: After the new stamps are issued, the old stamps should have been invalidated. At the request of business associations in various regions, and in order to show consideration for the businesses and the people, the government allowed the exchange of old stamps for new stamps. However, after careful investigation by the Ministry of Finance, it was found that a very distressing fact is that when the previous stamp tax sub-bureaus sold stamps, there were indeed many people who sold stamps in accordance with the law, but there were also many places where they forced quotas. After the tax quota was set, they only asked businesses and the people to pay the money, regardless of whether they had affixed the stamps in accordance with the law. Some even only took the money with a receipt and did not issue stamps. Therefore, most of the old stamps stored in various places were accumulated by cunning businesses and the people who did not affix the stamps in accordance with the law due to lax inspection. The next largest group was the petty tax collectors who cleverly obtained them from businesses and the people by illegal means. The flowers purchased and stored by good businesses and the people that have not yet been used are actually the smallest number. From the day the new stamp method was announced to the time of implementation, two or three months have passed. Even if there is stock, it should be used up. Even if it has not been used up, there should not be much left. However, it is rumored that in Shanghai alone, the total number of old stamps has reached several million yuan. The national statistics should also be alarming. Furthermore, recently, I heard that since the government allowed the exchange of old stamps for new stamps, many unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to purchase old stamps at low prices in various places in order to profit from them. If they are allowed to exchange them, the government will directly suffer the loss, and good merchants and the people will still indirectly suffer the loss. Only opportunistic officials and unscrupulous merchants will benefit from it. Therefore, in the process of this reform, not only should the government pay close attention to the registration method of the new and old exchanges and these unscrupulous officials and cunning merchants, but also the people should also supervise them closely so as not to be困 by both public and private matters. Furthermore, the revision of the stamp tax collection method not only changed the sales method, but also stipulated that 60% of the stamp tax revenue should be allocated to the local area to compensate for the short-term revenue of the provinces and counties due to the abolition of exorbitant taxes in order to enrich local government expenses and relieve the actual suffering of the people. The central government only receives 40%. Therefore, the direct beneficiaries of this stamp tax reform are the local governments and the people. Therefore, the governments and the people of all provinces, cities, and counties should effectively assist the government and earnestly investigate so that the new stamp tax can be promoted smoothly.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Again Orders Shaanxi Provincial Government to Abolish Kerosene Tax</h3>

<h3>Henan Zhongfu Company's Request to Reduce Mining Tax Denied</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance collects mining taxes from various places at 5% of the selling price. Jiang Weichang [Chiang Kai-shek] appointed Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Henan Provincial Construction Department, as Commissioner of the Henan Zhongfu Company to carry out rectification. Zhang telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting a reduction in the tax rate. The Ministry of Finance replied, stating: Commissioner Zhang Jingyu of the Zhongfu Joint Office, having read the case, the case has also been telegraphed to the Ministry by Chairman Jiang. The mining tax is collected at 5%, which is a common method for all mines and should be consistent and should not be different. As for the selling price of coal per ton, it was found in 1931 that the wholesale price per ton was slightly more than 5.3 yuan. In August of last year, the Tax Department of this Ministry sent personnel to investigate the market prices of various mines. According to the report, the highest selling price of the mine's products in the attached city market was Yuhe coal, which sold for slightly more than 17.6 yuan per ton, and the lowest was coal fines, which sold for 6.1 yuan per ton. Although coal fines accounted for the majority, the average selling price per ton, no matter what, has exceeded 5 yuan. The original case of this Ministry's assessment of the mine's tax payment only estimated the price at 5 yuan per ton and paid a tax rate of 25 cents at a rate of 5%, which was already lenient. Now, in the midst of rectifying the mining tax, even if it is not considered to be increased, the original state should be maintained. The requested reduction is difficult to approve.

According to the Chinese captain of the boat, he was told by the defendant that he intended to sail the boat to the British coast, but the next morning it had sailed into the Xijiang River. It then docked somewhere, and the crew disembarked. Local guards boarded the boat for inspection, raising suspicions and reporting to the customs authorities, who discovered the smuggled goods. The boat was then escorted to Guangzhou, and the three men were arrested and sent to the Japanese Consulate in Shamian. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>London Gold Price: Today's gold price is up three pence, at 139 shillings and 10 pence.</p>
<p>London Silver Market: Today's price also rose. Spot price is 23.5 pence, up 0.125. Futures price is 23.625 pence, up 0.1875. Sellers were particularly cautious in the morning, selling very little. There were slight purchases by two speculators. The market closed in the morning with relatively stable sentiment.</p>
<p>Bombay Silver Market: Today's silver price rose five annas at 5:30 PM, due to speculator manipulations. The opening price was 64 rupees, the same as yesterday's price, but the closing spot price rose five annas to 64 rupees and five annas.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market was quiet this morning with no exciting developments. Price fluctuations were minimal. In reality, the market was extremely quiet throughout the day with only a few transactions. The British-American exchange rate opened at $4.9825, up 0.0375 from yesterday's closing rate. At 1:00 PM, it fell by 0.04375 to $4.978125. This price remained unchanged at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>British-French: British-French exchange transactions were even fewer than British-American transactions. The opening price was 75.62 francs, up 0.12 from yesterday's closing price, but at 11:00 AM it fell by 0.09 to 75.53 francs. This value remained unchanged until 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>American-British: The American-British exchange rate opened this morning at $4.98, up 0.0125. The market then became quiet again. The most recent price is $4.9775, down 0.025 from the opening price.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>New York Cotton: The condition of spot cotton in the South is sluggish. The government's cotton production plan for next year is still unknown, affecting the cotton market. Some estimates place the cotton acreage at at least 34 million acres, higher than previous estimates. The cotton market opened with prices up 0.06 to 0.07 from yesterday's price, but prices stabilized due to industry purchases.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Wheat: The Winnipeg Grain Exchange, at the request of the government, announced today that starting today, the December and May wheat prices will have a minimum limit. The minimum price for December is 75 cents, and for May is 80 cents. The chairman of the exchange stated when announcing this minimum price that foreigners have continued to sell here recently, so some action had to be taken. It was not stated how long this plan would be in effect. The Winnipeg and Chicago wheat markets both opened higher today, with Winnipeg May futures up 0.0125 and Chicago up 0.0875. Continued reports of wheat rust in Argentina also contributed to the price increase.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: News of yellow rust in Argentine wheat has reversed yesterday's downward trend in the Liverpool wheat market, and prices have risen. At 1:00 PM, the December price was 4 shillings and 11.25 pence, up 0.75 from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Overnight foreign telegrams were not very satisfactory, and next year's American cotton production is still uncertain. In addition, the spot market is sluggish, so the Liverpool cotton market is quite cold. At 1:00 PM, the January price was 6.55, down 0.05 from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton: The cotton market fell at the 5:30 PM closing in Bombay today due to speculator selling and disappointing telegrams from Liverpool. The selling price for April-May white cotton was 209 rupees.</p>
<h3>Rubber</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday's market price plummeted. Today's trend is still slightly downward, due to the International Rubber Committee's failure to agree on a quota for next year, causing unease. The trading price for January-March at noon was 6.4375 pence, down 0.0625 from yesterday's closing price. The market is loose.</p>
<p>New York: Today's market price is also lower, expressing sympathy with the London market. The opening price fell by about 0.05, but the price rebounded later due to industry support.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York: Before the securities market opened, one factor favoring the market was that investment buying, which is the main element in maintaining the securities market. This action, in the current environment, can be considered exciting. Factors unfavorable to the market include instability in a major commodity market and the securities market, although slightly upward, has failed to excite speculator interest. The securities market opened sluggishly this morning, but sentiment was stable, and prices changed slightly, with ups and downs intermingled. It is expected that there will be some improvement in this long-depressed market. The New York securities prices are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Postures of Naked Children</h3>
<p>More than ten miles northwest of Zhangye, the willow trees line the road, the streams murmur, the villages are continuous, and the fields are fertile. On the surface, it is indeed worthy of the beautiful name of Golden Zhangye in terms of prosperity. (Gao Lan, Tianshui, Wuwei, and Zhangye are the four major prosperous areas in Gansu Province, and there is a saying: Golden Zhangye, Silver Wuwei, Gao Lan is done for, transfer to Tianshui. Then, after crossing the Zhangye River, it was exactly the season when the snow melted and the river water was warm, and the branches diverged into more than twenty large and small streams. The crossing route was unclear. The driver, Zhang Wenrui, first drove one car to test the shallow waters upstream, winding and turning, and fortunately landed on the other shore. The remaining four cars stopped and waited, and buried pots to cook. Zhang returned for lunch, taking a shortcut downstream, imitating the villagers by taking off his pants and wading. The water was only up to the abdomen, but the current was strong and he was washed down. Although he was rescued, his pants floated away, with twelve silver dollars, a silver-cased watch, and a driver's license inside, worth about more than thirty silver dollars. Everyone joked that he had paid for a swimming ticket. After a long time, Zhang began to say, "Really terrible, really terrible, this mountain flood. Last year, when fighting the Japanese, I also drove on various passes of the Great Wall, but there, I didn't even get stabbed once. I didn't expect to come here today and almost died in vain." Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>After crossing the river, we continued on the sandy beach, especially the section of Yazibao, where the sand was fine and soft. The car traveled on it, the wheels spun and the sand rose, sinking without advancing. Then, we unfolded the rope mats section by section. We spread one car of mats and traveled, then spread another car, reciprocating and dragging, like ferrying in the vast sea. Every time the car had difficulty passing, the passengers tried their best to rescue it. However, Mrs. He never participated, but she was not completely idle. She often gave cookies, chewing gum, and other small snacks to everyone who was helping. At that time, whether on the soft sandy beach or in the deep muddy pond, humming the sound of "Hang Yo, Hang Yo," and making the gesture of digging, pushing, and pulling, suddenly a fair-haired, blue-eyed, and smiling person of the opposite sex gave a cookie or chewing gum, holding it in the right hand, it was as if taking some potent stimulant. Immediately, the sound of "Hang Yo, Hang Yo" gradually subsided, and the work of digging, pushing, and pulling invisibly intensified. Old Chen, the head cook (from Chahar), said excitedly several times, "Having eaten the foreign lady's candy, how can you not work hard?" He also said, "Old Second," (namely the driver Zhang Wenrui, from Tianjin, "Hurry up and get to work, Mrs. He will give you candy in a while," and when he said this, his eyes were also glancing at Mrs. He. Sure enough, Old Second also exerted a lot of effort. The ability of a small cookie or a piece of candy to generate unexpected efficacy is generally the means used by imperialists against weak nations and the exploitative classes against the hardworking masses. It depends on whether the opposing party can be aware of it.</p>
<p>After crossing the soft sandy ridge, we continued on the hard sandy river for about twenty miles. In the distance, we saw the last car stranded in the river. It was already late, so we camped overnight on the grassland. We quickly ordered the two cars to go to help, and they all arrived late at night. From Renshou Village to here, the journey was thirty miles, about one hundred and ten li. About two li ahead, there is a village called Shajingzi. We went to buy eggs by moonlight. There were more than thirty households, most of whom slept under the eaves of the street in thatched sheds. Women in their forties were naked from the waist up while smoking. If passers-by were fellow smokers, they were welcome to borrow lamps. The ash from the pipe after smoking was the privilege of the lamp owner. Returning to the lodging, the moonlight was like a painting, and many villagers came to watch. There was also a blind man who sent firewood and insisted on stroking the car. Cook Chen was touched by his sincerity and allowed him, and playfully took his hand and touched the horn button, and it sounded loudly. Everyone was surprised and laughed. According to them, cars have often traveled up and down Longxi in recent years, but the villagers think they belong to the government, especially since this place has suffered from Ma Zhongying's army grabbing soldiers. Although they are curious, they all warn each other not to go forward. Now that they have the opportunity to watch, they are very happy, and so on. The villagers like to watch cars, but most dare not look at their own country's cars, and are willing to admire foreign cars. Although this is not of great importance, it is also an ominous abnormality.</p>
<p>The next morning—the 28th—the driver of the last car, a Finn named Mr. O, asked the name of the place where we stayed overnight because he was keeping a diary. Suddenly, I saw that he had a story in his notebook that was very shocking. It roughly said that last night the car was traveling on the sandy river, and I saw a person lying in a pool of blood. Because the evening was dim, I could not tell whether he was dead or alive. Later, because the car was stuck in the river, I hired people to unload the goods, and then I learned that the unfortunate person lying in the pool of blood was a local farmer who met several officials on the way and was forced to be a guide for the car. The direction was all sandy beaches, and the officials were angry. For a moment, fists and feet were flying, and his liver and brain were smeared on the ground, and so on. We did not see this matter, and we did not directly hear it from passers-by. It is difficult to judge the truth. However, it has been recorded in the foreigner's diary, and it always feels inappropriate. Foreigners often ridicule our country as an unorganized and lawless country, and always like to find an example of a revolutionary camp harming the people, citing it as an excuse for ridicule. Longxi is the only transportation artery in Gansu and Xinjiang. Looking at its future development, it will inevitably reopen the trend of the ancient Eurasian transportation shortcut. Foreigners doing business and traveling in the area, using it as an observation point in various aspects, will also increase day by day. Taking this trip as an example, there were eleven people in the group, five Chinese and six foreigners. Among the six foreigners, the reporter who kept a public diary could speak fluent Chinese and talked to women everywhere. It is expected that what he recorded must be more detailed than Mr. O. Mr. O is an engineer, and what he recorded must be more important than what Mrs. He recorded. It is sufficient to prove that foreigners' attention to our national conditions and the people is meticulous. In the future, even if the Chinese people, due to national environmental restrictions, cannot immediately give foreigners a good impression in construction, but it must never happen again that incidents like this one of taking people's lives lightly occur, and supply them with bad materials.</p>
<p>From Shajingzi to Weidiebao, which belongs to Fuyi County, the road is more than fifty miles long, with rivers, canals, villages, and inns constantly in sight. However, the land is mostly saline-alkali, the river is not perennial, there are more lean years than abundant years, and donations increase day by day. Farmers' income is insufficient, and they become increasingly impoverished, so that children of fourteen or fifteen years old still have no clothes or pants to wear. The people's livelihood in Longxi is impoverished. When I was in Lanzhou, Director Yong of the Education Department gave me a rough idea. Now that I have witnessed the actual situation, my heart is unbearable. I once talked to a naked boy and asked, "Little brother, how old are you?" He answered, "Fourteen years old." "Why don't you wear clothes?" "My mother won't let me *kuang*." (The pronunciation here is slightly to the left, for example, reading *chuan* as *kuang*, reading trees and land as *gong fu*). "How old do you have to be to wear them?" "I don't know." A smaller child next to him, who had clothes but no pants, suddenly said naively, "When I was little, I *kuang*ed a pair of pants once, and when I grow two years older, my mother will give me *mengdangku* - my mother said!" Hearing this, I could not help but feel sad. In addition, although the girls also have no pants, there is no difference between winter and summer. They mostly wear torn cotton clothes. Today, the car wanted to avoid Shasha River, but accidentally went astray. The villages we passed through had never seen a car before, and everyone came out of their empty houses to watch. I once saw several girls, besides having cloth strips wrapped around their feet and short hair on the east side, the rest were completely naked, and some had breasts with slightly raised areolas. Judging by their age, they should be fourteen or fifteen. However, such girls rarely crowded in front of the car, and mostly sat side by side with their knees together in the fields, gazing from afar. In order to decorate their natural state, they often frequently inserted double-petaled poppies (the petals are many and beautiful, very similar to small peonies, but the fruit is small and has no pulp) on their heads, which shows that their nature of loving beauty and being embarrassed is no different from that of wealthy women and celebrities. It is only because the source of life has been exploited that they are forced to do so. A Western philosopher said, "There is nothing permanent in the world under the sunlight." From this, we know that these small lives who are now fighting to the death with the demon of cold and starvation, although they cannot get help from the powerful in the current society, when the bright new era arrives, there will naturally be places where they can do their best and take what they need.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Japanese Army Exercise Causes Accident and Injures People</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldier Causes Accident and Brandishes Knife</p>
<p>Cloth Merchant Receives Treatment from Japanese Side and Apology Is Made to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the 25th of this month, the Tianjin Japanese army infantry and artillery have been going to the Mouniucheng area in southern Tianjin every day at 8:00 AM to practice field warfare. The exercises end at 2:00 PM every afternoon. At the same time, another unit of the Japanese army marches in groups on Dajing Road in Hebei District of Tianjin City to demonstrate, and they must pass in front of the Industrial College on Huangwei Road when they return. The college has been borrowed as the venue for the Hebei Provincial Administrative Conference since the 25th. The Japanese army has been using cars to transport exercise supplies from the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple to the Nankai area, constantly speeding back and forth. Wherever the cars and horses go, pedestrians avoid them. At 9:30 AM on the 29th, a Japanese armored car drove out of the Haiguang Temple barracks and headed to the exercise site outside the Xiguan. When it reached the front of the Xiyi Institute on Xiaoxiguan Street, the Japanese armored car did not reduce its speed and drove straight ahead because the road was too narrow and the cars and horses were crowded. Zhang Guilin, a cloth merchant from Yangliuqing in the suburbs of Tianjin, was coming on a bicycle. Because the road was bumpy, he was traveling very slowly. The Japanese armored car rushed towards him, and he was unable to dodge in time. He was knocked over onto the side of the road, and Zhang's left hip was severely injured. The Japanese armored car stopped, and more than twenty Japanese soldiers jumped out of the car. Second Lieutenant Tian Yuan in the squad was angry with Zhang and pulled out his bayonet and stabbed Zhang's arm twice, each about two fen deep. Zhang screamed in pain, which further angered the Japanese soldiers. They stepped forward, dragged Zhang down, and punched and kicked him severely. Several watch police officers and special police officers from the fifth precinct of the third branch of the Provincial Public Security Bureau arrived upon hearing the sound and tried their best to mediate, and the Japanese soldiers stopped reluctantly. At that time, the Japanese soldiers in the car released two homing pigeons they were carrying, which flew back to the Haiguang Temple barracks to report. Soon, Chief Warrant Officer Matsumoto of the Japanese Military Police rushed to the Provincial Public Security Bureau, accompanied by Chief of Special Operations Xie Ruchuan, and drove to the scene of the accident. First, they ordered the Japanese armored car to leave. Then, they sent the injured Zhang Guilin to the Japanese Army Hospital for treatment. After being cured by the Japanese side, he was sent back to the Chinese side, and no fees were charged. The Chinese side also agreed to handle the matter according to the Japanese side's proposal. At 2:00 PM, Chief Warrant Officer Matsumoto of the Special Operations Team went to the Provincial Public Security Bureau and unofficially apologized to Chief of Special Operations. The Chinese side asked him to convey to the Japanese military that the Japanese military must notify the Chinese side in advance when conducting activities outside the concession, so as to avoid similar unfortunate events from happening again.

<h3>Recent Situation in Zhongshan County, Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Organization and Content of a Model County</p>
<p>Tang Shaoyi Resigns from Political and Provincial Committees</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Following the political turmoil in Zhongshan, Tang Shaoyi has resigned. The Southwest Political Affairs Council has appointed Liang Hongguang to temporarily act as county magistrate. Liang took office on the 23rd, taking over from Luo Cequn, the head of the education division who was temporarily in charge. On the same day, Xiao Xiong was newly appointed as the head of the County Military Affairs Office, Li Shuoqing as the head of the Education Bureau, Zhu Zhuowen as the head of both the Land and Construction Bureau, Li Shaoqin as the head of the Public Security Bureau, and Wu Zhiqiang as the head of the Finance Bureau. After the new government was established, it immediately complied with the requests of local groups and moved the county seat from Tangjiawan back to Shiqi. Tangjiawan will have a Public Security Sub-Bureau to maintain local security. The original Shahui collection office in Zhongshan County had an annual expenditure of more than 180,000 yuan, which has now been reduced to 80,000 yuan. Zhongshan County is the hometown of Sun Zhongshan, and the central government specifically designated it as a model county, establishing a Political Training Committee to handle county affairs. The county magistrate is specially appointed and is not under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. Local tax revenue is also retained for local use and is not transferred to the provincial treasury. The total land and sea area of the county is 15,000 square li, with a land area of 8,671 square li. Cultivated land is divided into 2,230,276 mu of fields, 1,582,776.8 mu of paddy fields, 10,769,166 mu of mountain land, 10,043,888 mu of wasteland, and 683,471.8 mu of miscellaneous land, totaling 15,400,957.6 mu. The annual national tax revenue is 577,200 yuan, provincial tax is 1,274,200 yuan, local tax is 130,000 yuan, and surtax is 59,000 yuan. There are 211,882 households in the county, with a population of approximately 1,129,500. Many people go abroad to do business. The county is divided into nine districts, six towns, and 328 villages. There are about 14 village markets. The main products are rice, seafood, fish, shrimp, crab, and oysters. Agricultural products include rice, silk, taro, melons, vegetables, sugarcane, and olives. By-products include pigs, chickens, and ducks. Shiqi is the former county seat, with convenient water and land transportation and thriving commerce. About 87 miles of highways have been built. Long-distance buses from Shiqi can directly reach Tangjiawan, Qianshan, and Macau. Education is also relatively developed, with six middle schools, 432 primary schools, and a total of approximately 61,000 students. There are four libraries and 203 social education institutions. The county borders the sea and is connected to Macau. It was one of the first to be exposed to new ideas. Although it has recently been affected by the global economic downturn, with many overseas Chinese losing their jobs and less foreign investment flowing in, the fertile land in the county is actively developed and constructed, making it a truly model county. Former County Magistrate Tang Shaoyi, since resigning, has been recuperating in Hong Kong, feeling disheartened. He has recently resigned from his concurrent positions as a standing member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council and a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government. His submission stated: "To the esteemed Council: I, Yi, due to improper personnel appointments and ineffective pacification efforts, have, in accordance with the Council's telegram, handed over the county seal to Luo Guochang to handle concurrently, and properly completed the handover. I immediately came to Hong Kong for medical treatment, impeaching myself. On the 18th, I telegraphed requesting the dispatch of personnel to investigate and punish me. However, I am approaching seventy years of age and have suddenly suffered drastic changes. My blood pressure is as high as 200 degrees, and I am suffering from asthma and insomnia. After several months of recuperation, not only has my condition not improved, but it has also worsened. According to the doctor, it will be difficult to recover without long-term rest and medical treatment. I hereby truthfully report and respectfully request the Council to approve my resignation from the positions of member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council and member of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and appoint capable individuals to replace me so that I can focus on recuperation and avoid neglecting my duties, which would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Council of the National Government, Tang Shaoyi. (October 27)"</p>

<h3>### Robbery by Bandits in Xinzhuang</h3>
<p>At around 9 PM on New Year's Eve, the home of Zhu Yitang, a resident of Zhujiatang Village, 34th District, Xinzhuang, was suddenly approached by five bandits. Claiming to be relatives from Changqiao visiting a sick person, they asked to open the main gate. Zhu's son, Huogen, heard the noise and opened the door, discovering that the visitors were carrying handguns, knives, ropes, etc. Realizing they were not good people, one bandit stood guard outside while the other four entered the house and robbed them of 61 silver dollars, gold earrings, silver ornaments, fur coats, etc. They then escaped with their loot. Before leaving, the bandits also left behind hemp ropes, etc. The victim has provided a list of stolen items and requested that the County Public Security Bureau order a thorough investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>### Addition of Prosecutor to County Court</h3>
<p>The County Court of this county, after being inspected by personnel from the Ministry of Judicial Administration last year, deemed that the number of cases was small and subsequently forwarded a request to abolish one prosecutor to save expenses. However, this was at the time of the Lunar New Year, and thus the number of cases was smaller. Since the spring, one prosecutor has been insufficient to review the cases. Therefore, the president of the court and the chief prosecutor jointly submitted a request to the High Court to restore one prosecutor to facilitate litigation for the parties involved, etc. The High Court deemed this feasible and forwarded the request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval. Du Jiasheng, styled Wenwei, from Jiajiang, Sichuan, a prosecutor from the Wuxian District Court, was transferred to serve as a prosecutor in the County Court. He arrived in Songjiang by train at noon on the first day, paid his respects to Chief Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu, and then took office.</p>

<h3>### Corrupt Police Officer Who Released Red Pill Smugglers Sentenced</h3>
<p>Jiang Zhen, a former police officer at the Pengjian Town Public Security Outpost in this county, accepted a bribe of 1,700 yuan while in office and released red pill smugglers. Afterwards, he abandoned his post and fled. Hua Shijun, the former Director of Public Security, investigated and confirmed the facts and reported them to his superiors, who issued an arrest warrant. Last month, Jiang was seen by Wang Daben, a local resident, while wandering along the riverbank in his hometown of Zhenjiang. Wang reported it to the police, who arrested him and brought him back to the county for interrogation. Jiang stubbornly refused to confess. At 4 PM on the 30th, the presiding judge, Zhang Yizhi, opened the court and sentenced Jiang to three years of imprisonment for dereliction of duty. Jiang burst into tears upon hearing the verdict.</p>

<h3>### Provincial Committee Inspects Boundary Demarcation Between Jiading and Qingpu</h3>
<p>The county governments of this county and Qingpu County were ordered to reorganize administrative regions. County Magistrate Xu had already submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs, proposing that ten townships and towns north of the Wusong River in Qingpu County, including Qianxiang, Liao'e, Taqiao, Zhangzhuang, Wanpu, Cangxi, Mizhou, Zhujia, Lujiaxiang, etc., be incorporated into the western part of the second district of this county. The Xisheng Township of this county, located within Qingpu County, should be incorporated into Qingpu. However, Qingpu County insisted on only incorporating the two townships and towns of Qianxiang and Lujiaxiang into this county, and incorporating the Xisheng Township of this county into their county. Due to the conflicting opinions, the two county magistrates conducted a joint on-site inspection, but no agreement was reached. Finally, the two counties submitted their proposals to the Department of Civil Affairs for review and decision. Now, Xiang Dating, a special committee member of the Department of Civil Affairs, came to Jiading on the 27th and went to Qingpu the next morning to conduct an on-site inspection with the two county magistrates and the heads of the relevant districts and townships in order to make a decision. Committee Member Xiang has a slight cold. He will carry it out as soon as he recovers.</p>

<h3>### Land Price Declaration Divided into Groups for Guidance</h3>
<p>After Wuxi's land price declaration was approved by the province to temporarily suspend the collection of land price tax, the county government immediately convened a meeting with Hu Pinfang, the director of the Land Bureau, Qian Xianghou, the district head of the first district, and the heads of various townships in the urban area at the county government to instruct them to earnestly assist in the declaration and decided to divide the existing 34 townships into three groups, appointing instructors to provide guidance to each group. Yesterday (the 1st) morning, a meeting was held again at the county government with District Head Qian and various instructors to discuss the implementation steps. These are recorded as follows: 1. Instructor of the first group: Jin Yanze, guiding the 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 8th towns in the central district, Beizha, Tonghan, Beitang East, Beitang West, Huishang, Lizhuang, etc. towns, and Huangxiang and Wuhe villages. 2.

The above groups have been designated and are scheduled to depart today to provide guidance, and are limited to complete their work within this month.</p>
<h3>### Resolution of Disputes over Slaughter Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The local slaughter tax collection office previously caused a backlash from the meat industry due to the issue of tax increases. The meat industry voluntarily requested that the tax office send personnel to count the pigs and collect taxes, adding a stamp to the pigs. This situation lasted for half a month, and the dispute remained unresolved. Now, the matter has been repeatedly mediated by Qian Pei Qing of the County Chamber of Commerce, who convened both parties. It was decided that the slaughter tax would continue to be handled as before, with the Meat Industry Association collecting the tax on behalf of the government. The daily tax amount would be increased by 7.5 yuan from the original 69.3 yuan to a total of 76.8 yuan. This dispute has now been completely resolved.</p>
<h3>### Baogai Long Bridge Now Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>In recent years, factories in the county have closed down, business has plummeted, and the social economy is in a state of panic. The local financial system is able to circulate slightly due to scenic spots and historical sites, which attract foreign investment. This spring, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, local figures Rong Desheng, Xue Mingjian, Yu Xunzhen, etc., initiated the construction of a lakeside highway and the Baogai Long Bridge near Huaishu in the third district. The bridge is over 1,500 feet long, divided into sixty arches, and the bridge body can carry a weight of 20 tons, allowing long-distance buses to pass. Construction was completed by the end of September, with a total construction cost of over 120,000 yuan, making it the county's largest project. Now, rickshaws can directly reach the bridge, with round-trip fares around six corners. Yesterday, the reporter went by motorboat and saw a large number of tourists. Walking across the bridge took about twenty minutes to reach the other side. Houses are already being built at the eastern end of the bridge, and the wasteland is about to become a small market. The lakeside highway has been built to Dushan, which is north of Dongtouzhu Mountain. After further improvements, the entire road can be temporarily opened to traffic, but it cannot be used when it rains. The road originally had no surface and is now being built on the hillside, so the project is inevitably slightly delayed. Once rickshaws can pass through, there will certainly be more tourists.</p>

<h3>### Striving for Exemption for Completely Barren Fields</h3>
<p>This year's early drought was extremely severe. The county government previously submitted a request to the provincial government to exempt all taxes on over 130,000 mu of completely barren land. Subsequently, the provincial committee re-examined the situation and determined that 60% of the taxes on the completely barren land should still be collected. At a time when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, this is truly unbearable. Yesterday (the 30th), a citizen, Zhang Xilai, wrote to County Magistrate Bao, strongly advocating for continued exemption to alleviate the people's hardships.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Finance Ministry Informs Municipal Government that Banks and Money Houses Should Comply with Registration Regulations</h3>
<p>Orders Bank Association to Refuse Membership to Unregistered Institutions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that the various unregistered banks that have recently emerged have vague standards for their business scope, and most do not join the Bank Association. The government and the public are unable to supervise them in advance, which often leads to bankruptcies that disrupt the financial system and affect the public. It is imperative to take strict measures to prevent such occurrences. The Ministry specifically informed the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, ordering all unregistered banks to register in accordance with regulations, and ordering the Bank Association to refuse membership to any unregistered banks. The original text is as follows:</p>
<h3>To the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The regulations and implementing rules for bank registration were drafted and promulgated by the Ministry long ago. Any bank that opens should first draft its articles of association, including all important provisions, and submit them to the local government for forwarding, or directly to the Ministry for approval. Banks that have already begun operations but have not been registered should also complete registration within six months after the implementation of the registration regulations in order to obtain a license. All of these are clearly stipulated in the regulations. Currently, many banks in various provinces and cities have complied with the regulations and applied for registration, but there are still some who are waiting to see what happens and have delayed their applications. If this continues, it will not only be difficult for the Ministry to effectively supervise, but it will also be difficult for the public to choose reliable institutions. A list of all banks approved for registration by the Ministry, including their names, organization, paid-up capital, headquarters location, approval dates, and business license numbers, as of the end of September this year, is attached for your reference. You are requested to thoroughly investigate and clarify the situation in your jurisdiction. If you find any unregistered banks or money houses, you should order them to promptly comply with the regulations and submit the necessary registration documents to the Ministry for review and approval. At the same time, you should pay close attention to supervision. When a registered bank establishes branches in various provinces and cities, it should submit a film of the registration documents approved by the Ministry and the branch establishment documents to the local government for verification and filing. Any bank that establishes branches without approval should be reported by the local government to the Ministry for review and action in order to comply with the law and facilitate inspection. In addition to the branch institutions, the bank registration list are attached together to the document for your provincial and municipal governments to check, and it is hoped that it will be passed down to the subordinate institutions for integrated knowledge. In the future, if there is any new bank registration, the Ministry will successively inform you in order to connect.</p>
<h3>To the Bank Association</h3>
<p>Another order was issued to the Bank Association, stating: "The Bank Association is a legal entity that seeks the common interests of banks. All member banks should be limited to banks that have been legally approved for registration by the Ministry, and a list of all banks approved for registration by the Ministry as of the end of September of this year is copied and issued for your compliance. If any unregistered bank joins as a member bank, the Association should refuse membership in order to show distinction and protect legal interests. In the future, if there are any newly approved registered banks, the Ministry will copy and issue them to you in a timely manner for your information. You are hereby informed."</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Emphasizes Banking Law</h3>
<p>Banking Law Research Association Holds Meeting</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the bankruptcy of the China Industrial Bank, there have been rumors in the market that several smaller banks are in a precarious situation. According to news from the banking industry yesterday morning, this is an overestimation. However, at a time of extreme financial panic in society, smaller banks may inevitably experience temporary financial difficulties. Therefore, the leaders of major banks in this city are paying close attention to this issue and have held talks with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi regarding the implementation of banking law. However, banking industry insiders believe that there are still one or two areas in the drafted regulations that need to be amended. Once the banking law is implemented, events such as the bankruptcy of the China Industrial Bank can often be avoided.</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Banking Law Research Committee organized by the Shanghai Banking Industry Association held its third committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. The attendees included seven committee members: Xu Jiyi, Ye Fuxiao, Qu Jigang, Jing Runshi, Zhang Naiqi, Zhu Boquan, and Jin Guobao. Xu Jiyi was elected as chairman. The committee had previously sent letters to various banks seeking their opinions on the banking law. However, the committee has not yet received replies from the banks. Therefore, the meeting continued to explore the provisions of the banking law. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. It is reported that several more meetings will be required before a result can be reached.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talks</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Travel South Soon</p>
<p>Timing of Cotton Yarn Tax Increase Undetermined</p>
<p>Pilots Must Pass Examination</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Beijing by overnight train at 11:00 PM the night before and arrived in Zhenru at 7:15 AM yesterday morning. He immediately transferred to a car and returned to his private residence on Avenue Foch for rest. Subsequently, at around 10:30 AM, he met with reporters at his residence. At 11:00 AM, he went to the Central Bank on the Bund to work. The following is a record of Kong's remarks:</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Travel South Soon</h3>
<p>According to Kong, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been examining his health in Peiping for several days, and the results are very robust. Chiang will leave Peiping for the South in the coming days and will make a brief stop in Nanjing before heading to Jiangxi to preside over the suppression of bandits. The date of my return to the North has not yet been determined. In short, I will travel as soon as I have the time.</p>
<h3>Deliberations on Cotton Yarn Unified Tax</h3>
<p>The government strives for fair taxation. Various unified taxes have been increased recently, but the cotton yarn unified tax has not been increased. The current increase in the cotton yarn unified tax is to seek tax fairness. Before proposing the tax increase, the authorities conducted a detailed investigation of the cotton yarn industry and had a period of contact with it. Now that the cotton yarn industry has various difficulties and has appealed to the central government, the central government is currently considering the matter. The central government can accept some of the opinions of the cotton yarn industry. The principle of increasing the cotton yarn unified tax has now been approved by the Central Political Committee and has been handed over to the Ministry of Finance for detailed consideration. The date of implementation has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Pilots Must Pass Examination</h3>
<p>Examination is a government system. The current examination of pilots in the Songhu area by the Pilot Management Committee is to protect the interests of the public. Pilots are technical personnel who are responsible for the lives and property of passengers. How can they be competent if they do not pass the examination? In order to protect the interests of the public, the government will refuse to allow pilots who have not passed the examination by the Pilot Committee to clear customs.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Drill to Be Held in Shanghai Tomorrow Evening</h3>
<p>Preparations Have Been Busy for Days</p>

Shanghai is located near the coast, and every year in autumn and summer, typhoons and high tides, although they have not caused disasters, local people often feel anxious when they hear the alert. In order to cultivate the disaster prevention knowledge of local military police groups and mass organizations, a large-scale drill will be held in the north and south urban areas tomorrow night (the night of the 3rd). The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Command, together with mass organizations, have been preparing for days and have been very busy.</p>

<h3>Shipping Association Appeals for Pilotage Issue via Telegram Yesterday</h3>
<p>Please Instruct Customs Not to Impose Sanctions Preventing Departure</p>
<p>Expedite Negotiations with Shipping Companies to Resolve Issue and Prevent Escalation</p>
<p>After the promulgation and implementation of the new regulations for the Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee in the Song-Han area, the Jianghai Customs refused pilotage to pilots who failed the exam. Shipping companies resolved to suspend shipping, and the unqualified pilots submitted a petition, having gone to Beijing the night before to petition. The Shanghai Shipping Association telegraphed an urgent appeal, saying: To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, for your review. The Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee was jointly established by the Ministries of Finance, Transportation, Navy, and the General Staff, with the Customs Maritime Division as chairman. Because pilotage relates to national defense, the intention is to reclaim sovereignty. All citizens feel deeply gratified. However, since the establishment of the committee, there have been no plans to reclaim the management of foreign pilots in Shanghai Tongsha and British and Japanese pilots between Wusong and Hankou, while the management of Chinese pilots in Song-Han has been implemented suddenly. The newly established fee rates are more than double the old rates, which is not something that shipping companies, which are already extremely impoverished, can bear. After deliberation by various shipping companies, they requested the relevant ministries to appeal, earnestly instructing them to review and reduce the fees and to formulate appropriate measures. Also, a letter was sent to the Inspector General of Customs, instructing all customs offices that, before the issue is resolved, if shipping companies cannot comply with the new regulations, do not impose sanctions preventing departure, so as to avoid suspension of shipping and affecting commercial transportation. Subsequently, a telegram was received from the Ministries of Navy, Transportation, and General Staff, stating that the Ministry of Finance was being consulted. Following this, an instruction was received from the Ministry of Transportation to directly contact the committee. On the [day and month were deliberately left blank in the original] of this month, the committee chairman, Canal, sent a letter inviting responsible personnel from the profession to attend a meeting on the [day and month were deliberately left blank in the original] to discuss the matter. After meeting as scheduled, the committee agreed to consider reducing the newly established fee rates and to decide on the matter after consultation with the pilot association. Before a decision is made, only pilots holding pilot licenses issued by the Ministry of Navy can be freely employed for pilotage. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Chunhe ship of the Hefeng Company, scheduled to depart for Nanjing, was required by the Jianghai Customs to comply with the committee's new regulations, resulting in the ship being prevented from departing and forced to anchor and await a solution. After a meeting of various shipping companies, a unanimous decision was made that all ships arriving subsequently to travel to the Yangtze River would be forced to suspend shipping if Customs refused to allow them to depart. Everyone agreed, and attempts to dissuade them were unsuccessful. The stagnation of trade and goods has caused widespread anxiety, and the matter is of great importance. Therefore, we dare to disregard the presumption and urgently telegram Your (Ministry) (Government) Yuan, transferring to (the National Government to instruct the responsible ministry) (instruct the responsible ministry) (instruct the responsible ministries) to quickly instruct the Pilotage Administration Committee and the Customs not to impose sanctions preventing departure until the case is resolved through negotiations between the shipping companies. We also earnestly request instructions to expedite negotiations with the shipping companies to resolve the issue, so as to avoid escalating the situation and affecting the overall situation. We have presented our case with utmost sincerity and await your instructions with utmost anxiety. Respectfully, Yu Hede, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association.</p>
<h3>Fishery Protection Office Dispatches Naval Vessel Haihong to Protect Fisheries</h3>
<p>It Has Already Arrived and Anchored at Shenjiamen</p>
<p>As the winter fishing season arrives, fishing boats from various groups in Shenjiamen have already begun to set sail for fishing. It has been reported that fishermen have again been subjected to piracy. In view of this, the Fishery Protection Office has specially dispatched the naval vessel Haihong and others to implement fishery protection. It has now arrived and anchored at Shenjiamen in order to sail and patrol at any time to maintain order and suppress disturbances.</p>
<h3>Both Ships Ran Aground in Tongzhou</h3>
<p>But Both Escaped Danger</p>
<p>The Zhongning ship of the Hua Ning Company of Sijing Road, which was carrying 1,300 tons of coal from Pukou to Shanghai this time, arrived at Jiangyin on October 30. Due to the receding river water and the fog, the ship ran aground on a shoal. The shipowner had reported this and planned to wait for the tide to rise and find a way to get out on their own. After receiving the report, the Shanghai head office did not dispatch a tugboat to rescue it, as the situation was not very critical.</p>
<h3>Ran Aground for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Later, during high tide, the captain of the Zhongning ship immediately put the ship at full power and pulled the ship off the shoal in Jiangyin and sailed towards Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the ship arrived at the Tongzhou sandbar. The water there was very shallow, and the heavily laden Zhongning ran aground for the second time, and deeper than the first time. For a while, it was still unable to move away from the shoal. The shipowner telegraphed Shanghai to report again, while waiting for the tide to rise to seek escape.</p>
<h3>Stern Was Hit</h3>
<p>The Changxing, a regular Yangtze River boat of the Sanbei Company, was heading downstream from Hankou. After passing through the area, it was also stuck on the Tongzhou sandbar due to heavy cargo and shallow water. After the Changxing shipowner was stranded, he immediately used full power to reverse and back away from the shoal. According to a Hua Ning Company person who spoke to the reporter, the Zhongning ship was stranded on the sandbar and could not move. When the Changxing ship reversed, the stern of the Zhongning ship was hit by the Changxing, causing damage. The extent of the damage will not be known until the Zhongning arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Both Ships Escaped Danger</h3>
<p>The Changxing ship immediately escaped the danger by reversing and returned to Shanghai as usual. It returned to Shen yesterday and is already unloading passengers and cargo in Pudong. The hull was not damaged. After escaping danger in Hexing, the Zhongning ship also managed to leave the sandbar at high tide. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received a telegram from the ship stating that it would arrive in Shanghai today. The extent of the collision damage will be inspected after the ship arrives to determine whether or not repairs are needed.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement Promotion Association Announces Ban on Misuse of the Term "New Life"</h3>
<p>All Unregistered Activities Will Be Banned</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city received a notice from the Nanchang General Association.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The notice stated that recently, some speculators have been misusing the term "New Life" for their own benefit, which violates the essence of the New Life Movement. Therefore, the association issued a notice yesterday stating that all activities using the name "New Life" without prior review and registration will be banned. The notice is recorded below: Notice regarding the matter: A notice, No. 7 of the Shengzi series, was received from the Nanchang New Life Movement Promotion General Association, stating: "The New Life Movement is a practical movement to correct current malpractices and change the social atmosphere. It does not engage in excessive publicity or superficial extravagance. It is what it is, and it says what it means. It does not seek to be a fad among all people in the country, but rather seeks the gradual progress of each individual. This is the main principle of this association, which we dare not violate. Recently, various colorful organizations have been found everywhere, such as New Life Propaganda Teams, New Life Theaters, New Life Hotels, New Life Shops, and even New Life brand cigarettes. There are so many names that it is impossible to investigate them all. While China is not lacking in enthusiastic supporters of the New Life Movement who are making efforts in this regard, there are also many opportunistic elements who are using the name of New Life to carry out their speculative activities. This not only violates the essence of simplicity but also endangers the future of this movement. In the future, all activities using the name "New Life" that have not been reviewed and registered by the local New Life Movement Promotion Association will be banned in order to maintain the movement and prevent opportunism." We are instructed to handle this matter accordingly. In the future, all sectors in this city that use the name "New Life" without having been reviewed and registered by this association must be banned in order to prevent opportunism. In addition to separate notices, this notice is hereby issued to all sectors in this city for their information.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company's Lanzhou-Baotou Route Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, when the Eurasia Aviation Corporation changed to the winter flight schedule on the 15th of the month, the newly opened Lanzhou-Baotou route only reached Ningxia after its opening because the Baotou airport was still under repair. Now that the Baotou airport has been completed, and it was the scheduled day for the northbound flight on the Lanzhou-Baotou route, the entire route was opened yesterday.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce Arrive in Shanghai to Discuss Stamp Tax Issue</h3>
<p>Advocate Continuing to Fight for New Tax Law</p>
<p>The new stamp tax stamps were issued by the post office starting yesterday. All old stamps that have not been used up can no longer be used now. Await the Ministry of Finance to formulate registration methods before they can be exchanged in installments. The Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce sent two members, Gu Suming and Zhang Minze, to Shanghai yesterday to discuss the issue of the general use of old stamp taxes with the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting and Secretary Yan E-sheng met with them and advocated that for the exchange of old stamps for new ones, they could only comply with the ministry's order. However, they should continue to strive against the new tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday is recorded below: To the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Gu and Zhang, your esteemed members, have come to Shanghai. The discussions were very harmonious. The Chamber believes that since the government has agreed to exchange old stamp tax stamps for new ones, the merchants and people only hope to avoid losses. They have no fixed opinions on new or old stamps. Moreover, all three previous telegrams to the ministry requested an exchange, not a request for concurrent use. It is difficult to overturn the previous proposal at this time. However, the exchange method has not been announced, and the business community cannot help but be anxious. In addition to having already telegraphed the ministry to urge them, we will continue to urge them if there is no clear order within the next few days. As for the inconveniences of the new stamp tax law, we have already protested twice by telegram. We urge your esteemed association to give support, so that the mission can be accomplished. We hope. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Disaster-Stricken Areas in the County Generally Reduce Field Tax</h3>
<p>The Provincial Committee Decided to Reduce It by 9%</p>
<p>Due to autumn harvest disasters in the agricultural fields of Shanghai County, the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments of Jiangsu Province, after receiving the report from the county government, each sent members Chen Guanliu, Hou Mingen, Yao Yongping, and others to the county one after another to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the disaster situation in various districts. It is now known that the committees, accompanied by Zhang Guangrong, the chief of the second section of the county committee, completed the on-the-spot inspection in various districts and discussed the matter together in the county government. As a result, it was agreed that the disaster in the county was not extremely severe, but the burden on the people should be reduced, and the field tax, which is the income of the province, must be taken into account. It was decided to temporarily reduce the levy by 9%, which is 91% of the original tax. The inspection and the determined tax reduction were presented to the provincial departments for review and guidance.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Plans to Issue Bonds</h3>
<p>Totaling 70 Million Yuan, with Salt Surplus as Collateral</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Will Ask Jiang for Instructions on Everything</p>
<p>Since Liu Xiang's reinstatement, the political situation in Sichuan Province has allowed various armies to cooperate. Liu has recently been actively reorganizing the financial situation as the first step in suppressing bandits and pacifying Sichuan. A reporter from Datong News Agency interviewed a certain important person who had just flown to Shanghai from Chongqing last night, and was told the detailed situation of Sichuan Province recently. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Chengdu Conference: Cooperation Among Armies</h3>
<p>According to the discussion, Liu summoned various generals immediately after returning to Chengdu on October 9 and held an emergency meeting. The representatives of the various armies felt that in the past, due to the loss of contact between the parties, it was difficult to achieve results in military affairs, and the Communist bandits were given a chance to become extremely rampant. Therefore, the meeting decided on three major policies. 1. All future military command will be directed by Liu, and all parties recognize the necessity of a unified will. 2. The suppression of the Communist bandits in Sichuan and the entire Chinese bandit suppression issue. Plans for military and financial affairs are all planned by the central government, and the central government is absolutely obeyed in the future, and the policies decided by the central government are implemented. 3. Among the military personnel in Sichuan Province, there is Liu Congyun, who has always participated in confidential matters and has quite a few of the shortcomings of You Da Mai. It was decided to remove him from his position to avoid hindering the overall plan of obedience to the central government.</p>
<h3>Plans to Issue Bonds with Salt Surplus as Collateral</h3>
<p>Nine out of ten of the difficulties in Sichuan now lie in the exhaustion of financial resources. The division of territories into defense zones has not been eliminated, and administration has not been unified, so that all important affairs cannot be rectified. At present, in order to break the defense zone system, maintain the status quo, and reorganize the future military and political issues, it is proposed to request the central government to use the surplus of Sichuan salt tax and other national taxes as collateral to issue bonds of 70 million yuan in Shanghai. Liu has entrusted a certain important financial figure who recently came to Shanghai from Sichuan to contact the financial authorities about everything. Once the authorities approve, it can be implemented. The annual revenue of salt tax in Sichuan Province is about 13 to 14 million yuan. If reorganized, it can be increased to about 20 million yuan. Since the Ministry of Finance sent Liu Shumei as the director of the Chongqing Audit Office, the salt affairs in the province have been gradually promoted. Recently, tax revenue has been increasing day by day, and even the foreign debt election quota that could not be remitted for five or six years has been remitted to Shanghai on a monthly basis. If administration and anti-smuggling can be rectified at the same time in the future, the increase in salt tax can be expected. Therefore, the issuance of public bonds in Sichuan Province with the salt surplus as collateral should not be difficult to promote.</p>
<h3>Liu Will Soon Leave Sichuan to Meet with Jiang</h3>
<p>Liu had a plan to go to Beijing three years ago, but it failed to materialize due to various reasons. Now, due to various military and financial relations, they are the fundamental issues of bandit suppression and pacification of Sichuan. Therefore, it is necessary to leave Sichuan to meet with Chairman Jiang to ask for instructions on everything. He Chengjun, the appeasement commissioner of Hubei and Hunan, has contacted Chairman Jiang to arrange the date and location of the meeting. Once the arrangements are made, Liu will fly to meet with him. After meeting with Jiang, he may have to go to Beijing to meet with the authorities of various ministries and departments to seek concrete solutions. This matter is of great importance to the future of Sichuan Province, and the problems of bandit suppression and pacification of Sichuan will be decided by this trip.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cigarette Factory Association Opposes Affixing Stamps on Each Pack</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association has repeatedly received reports from its members that there is a proposal to change the affixing of the cigarette unified tax stamps from the box to each small pack. The public is anxious, as it is difficult both publicly and privately. Therefore, a meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members was convened a few days ago to discuss the matter. More than ten people, including Lao Jingxiu, Shen Xingde, Bao Gengzhong, Sun Lishan, and Li Xuedong, attended. Chairman Shen Weiting reported that, according to recent statements from various members, they had heard that the Ministry of Finance planned to change the cigarette unified tax payment certificate (i.e., stamp) from box stamps to pack stamps. He asked the attendees to discuss how to handle this matter. After careful discussion by all the committee members in the morning, they all believed that the cigarette pack stamp began in the early days of the special tax and unified tax era. Later, because it was inconvenient for both officials and merchants, the pack stamp was cancelled and replaced with the shoulder stamp, which has been in place for a long time, and both parties have found it convenient. Recently, there has been a proposal to change back to pack stamps. If implemented, our member factories will suffer significant damage in terms of logistics, procedures, and transportation, and there will also be difficulties in tax-exempt and tax-refund areas. It was unanimously decided to petition the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Tax Administration to exempt them from implementation.</p>
<h3>Chenhang District Plans to Dredge Two Rivers</h3>
<p>Last summer, the Chenhang District of Shanghai County suffered from drought and dry rivers, resulting in agricultural disasters. The district chief, Xing Zhigang, found that the Dayongtang in the district flows through Kuli, Lutan, Zhaojiadang, Du Zhe, Cangqiao, Yangshuwei Ningxiang, and the Dongjingzigang flows through Yinxiang, Chenhang, Xinyi, Tiqiao, Taolong, and other villages. At present, it has been silted up for a long time, which is very detrimental to farmland water conservancy. Therefore, a report was submitted to the county government and submitted to the Construction Committee for approval. Technicians Ling Xiaoyun and others have been dispatched to the Dayongtang and Dongjingzigang rivers for surveying and measuring to calculate the project. The district will open and dredge it by means of light labor.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Situation in Danyang</h3>
<p>Dean Yu's Noble Character</p>
<p>Flour Merchants are Generous and Charitable</p>
<p>The situation in Danyang, where official representatives came to Shanghai to raise relief funds, has been reported in this newspaper many times. The day before yesterday morning, Bi Jingqian and Jiang Kesheng, holding Ma Xiangbo's orders, visited Mr. Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, at his Jingan Villa and Yulu. They were received with great difficulty, but Mr. Yu generously agreed to join in the relief effort and decided to serve as a coolie. In the next few days, he plans to go to Xujiahui to inquire about Master Ma's health and ask him to donate small items to give to those who are willing to do good. Dean Yu's noble character is admired by everyone, and even a small piece of his calligraphy is regarded as a treasure. This righteous act will surely bring the dead back to life and the rotten flesh back to white, which is a great fortune for the disaster victims in Danyang. It is said that in the fundraising section, more than 10,000 yuan has been recognized at the Xiaoyoutian banquet last night. The most rare thing is that Bi was formerly the magistrate of Yangzhong County. Fortunately, he was able to persuade and raise funds effectively to save countless people. Therefore, this time, the Yangzhong merchants in Shanghai, such as Huang Zipeng and Zhu Zhengke, are all willing to contribute to Magistrate Bi's fundraising. Although there are clear instructions in ancient times to help the victims and care for the neighbors, in fact, Magistrate Bi's friendship has always been trusted. It is said that there are no less than 800 tourism flour merchants in Danyang, and many of them are also able to care for their hometown and promote great righteousness. Bi, Yin, and Jiang have decided to visit their leaders today and ask them to contribute as much as they can, so that they can gather sand into a tower. In addition, in the industrial and commercial sectors, because the two county magistrates Bi Jingqian and Jiang Zhengchan are responsible for their duties, they will first return to Danyang and Jiaxing, while Jiang Kesheng will stay and make contacts. The reporter specially visited Jiang Kesheng at the Dahua Hotel, and was told that the fundraising situation was enthusiastic, which is enough to show the progress of people's morality in recent years. The only purpose of running around in recent days is to exceed 15,000 yuan, so that the provincial government can be requested to increase the relief funds, so that the disaster victims can receive more benefits. As for the investigation of the affected households, the fellow villagers association in Shanghai has also agreed to send members back to Danyang to assist in order to seek accurate information. In the future, the distribution of relief funds will focus on food and cotton clothes, while able-bodied men will be listed separately for labor relief.</p>
<h3>French Code Expert Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Ai Si Jiala (transliteration), a French legal advisor to the former Beijing Code Compilation Committee and currently recommended by the League of Nations as a legal advisor to the National Government, also a professor at the University of Paris, who can read Chinese and study ancient Chinese law, has arrived in Shanghai from France. The Municipal Bar Association plans to host a banquet on a selected date to welcome Mr. Ai and invite all executive and supervisory committee members to attend.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Dispatches Twelve Patrol Vessels to Suppress Smuggling</h3>
<p>Currently Patrolling in the Waters of Zhejiang</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs believes that the amount of tax evasion in inland waters is very large, and the Zhoushan Islands are the hub for transshipment. Previously, a small steamer loaded with rayon and sugar was seized in Saigang and sent back to Shanghai for punishment. It is now known that the Jianghai Customs has dispatched twelve patrol vessels to patrol the waters off Zhejiang, especially the Zhoushan Islands, which are denser than Wusong. At the same time, there are still a considerable number of long-distance sailing junks and docks everywhere, so special attention is paid. Yesterday, the two patrol vessels, Wenxing and Feixing, sailed to Zhushanmen and anchored. They specially put down small motorboats to patrol Panshi, Wuchanshan, and Nantou, and sent personnel to land on the Zhoushan Wharf to inquire about the import situation of various foreign goods stores and inspect whether there was any tax evasion in the port. It is planned to stay here for one month and then sail to various islands for patrol.</p>
<h3>Specimens of Flora and Fauna from Kangzang Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Mr. and Mrs. Yang, Chinese people who grew up in Hawaii, and their younger brother, went to the Kangzang border area of ​​Western Sichuan this spring to collect specimens of flora and fauna. It has been seven months since then, and they will arrive in Shanghai by boat on [day was deliberately left blank in the original] (1st) of this day, carrying four Tibetan pheasants, one Tibetan fox, one blue sheep, and several kinds of dead animals. In addition, there are more than a thousand kinds of plant specimens. These specimens were collected on behalf of museums in Nanjing, Shanghai, and foreign countries, and there are many treasures among them. There were many dangers on the way, but Mr. Yang and others were able to endure hardship and return with a full load, which is rare.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers in Jiangning in Shanghai Inquire About the Content of the Report on Wasteland</h3>
<p>The Jiangning County Government has promulgated rules for reporting wasteland, stipulating that wasteland such as cemeteries and barren mountains must be reported within one month with a red deed or a taxed white deed. Those who fail to report within the time limit or do not have a red deed or tax deed will be confiscated and used as public land. After receiving the report, the fellow villagers in Shanghai believed that it was difficult to implement, and they inquired about the details from the Jiangning Six Counties Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai. The association telegraphed the Jiangning County Government yesterday to inquire about the matter. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: To Magistrate Mei of the Jiangning County Government, it is reported that your government has recently promulgated rules for Chen Bao on wasteland, with a limited requirement for Chen Yan Red Deed. It is learned that in the Jiangning area, after the Hong Ti Revolution, most of the red deeds of the owners were lost and no longer exist. If Chen Zhuan is not allowed because there is no red deed, it is feared that there will be losses. It is also learned that the Chen Bao period is limited to one month, which is too short. I don’t know how the promulgation procedures for this rule were carried out, and whether it is already in effect. Fellow villagers in Shanghai have received family reports and are suspicious and fearful. This is a first telegram to you, and I hope you will show the content in detail to dispel the doubts of the people. Jiangning Six Counties Fellow Villagers and others pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Record of the Tsinghua Alumni Association's Gathering</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association held a gathering at the International Grand Hotel, a newly built twenty-two-story building of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, at eight o'clock the night before last. More than four hundred members, family members, Chinese and foreign guests attended. The gathering was presided over by Chairman Wang Zheng, with Yang Bingxun as co-recorder. Because Mr. Wang was on official business in Beijing and unable to attend, former principal of Qinghua Preparatory School Cao Yunxiang gave a speech. He said that Chinese students sent to the United States for studies could be divided into four stages, and the students sent by Tsinghua belonged to the fourth stage. Yang Rong was the first Chinese student sent to the United States, entering Yale University in 1850 and graduating in 1854. After returning to China, he did not hold a major position for twenty years. After twenty years, he had the opportunity to suggest to the government the establishment of the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau and the China Merchants Bureau and the Telegraph Bureau, and applied for the government to send one hundred and twenty students to study in the United States. Later, Liang Cheng requested the U.S. President to use the Boxer Indemnity to send Chinese students to the United States for study. In order to continue cultivating talents, Tsinghua School was established, stipulating that one thousand eight hundred students would be sent to the United States for study. After all were sent, the school could be closed. Later, some people advocated using a portion of the indemnity as a school fund, so that Tsinghua University could permanently cultivate talents and become China's highest institution of learning. We know that the establishment of Tsinghua University came from the Boxer Indemnity, and the Boxer Indemnity is the crystallization of the sweat and blood of all our people. Therefore, Tsinghua graduates cannot be satisfied with merely obtaining a comfortable position for themselves, but must do their utmost to serve the country and society in order to repay the kindness of the elders of the country. Yang Rong spent twenty years before he had the opportunity to advise the government, and Sun Yat-sen accumulated forty years of experience before he could bring the revolution to a conclusion. Therefore, today I hope that our Tsinghua classmates all have a spirit of sacrifice and serve China. Next, General Manager Wu Daquan of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society gave a speech on the significance of establishing the International Grand Hotel. After the meeting, a social dance began, ending at one o'clock.</p>

<h3>French Concession Police Chief Fabre Takes Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>Will Return to Shanghai in About Nine Months</p>
<p>The current Chief of the French Concession Police, Cmdt. L. Fabre, is scheduled to return to France tomorrow (3rd) on the Italian mail ship Conte Komo. Since taking office as Chief of the French Concession Police, Fabre has made considerable contributions to local security. Therefore, after the news of the French Municipal Council granting him leave to return home spread, both Chinese and foreign dignitaries in Shanghai have been giving Fabre farewells, keeping him very busy with social engagements. It is understood that Fabre is returning to Paris to recuperate for a few months due to his deep longing for his relatives, fulfilling his duty to serve them. His wife had already returned home this summer. It is said that during his leave, Captain Gaible will serve as acting Chief. A detailed account of his history has been obtained and is recorded below. Fabre is from Comman, in the Allier department. He was born in 1896. He was exceptionally intelligent from a young age and, after graduating from secondary school, he applied to the Saint-Cyr Military Academy. He graduated just before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, without having the opportunity for in-depth study, and immediately went to the front. On December 5th of that year, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the army. On January 5th of the following year, he was promoted to lieutenant, and on August 2nd, 1917, he was promoted to captain. During the height of the Great War, he suffered serious injuries and was repeatedly decorated. In 1918, he received the Fourragère Croix de Guerre and the Knight of the Legion of Honor. Later, in 1920, he was demobilized as a battalion commander. In June of the same year, after graduating from the Joan Military School (because the war had interrupted his studies, he re-entered the school for supplementary study from February 25th, 1919, to January 15th, 1920), Fabre was transferred to Syria, where he was twice commended for his merits (once in the army and once in the first brigade of the Eastern Expedition) and received the Croix de Guerre with two stars. Subsequently, in September 1921, he returned home for a short rest and was immediately appointed Chief of Staff of the Far East Garrison. On September 10th, 1924, he was transferred to the Foreign Affairs Department as a foreign service officer, actually serving as Deputy Superintendent of the Tianjin French Concession Police. He was promoted to Superintendent on January 1st, 1928, and concurrently served as Commander of the Garrison in 1931. On March 8th, 1932, he was transferred to Shanghai to serve as Chief of the French Concession Police Department. In addition to the decorations and awards from the French government and the Syrian Expeditionary Force, Fabre has also received the Annam Empire's Yellow Golden Precious Medal, the Gold Medal from the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council, a sports medal, and the Allied and Near East European War Memorial Medal. In total, Fabre has spent his life in the military for twenty years, except for the last ten years in important administrative positions in the Foreign Affairs Department. His spirit and energy are evident.</p>

<h3>Dai Enji Returns to Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Talk</h3>
<p>CNAC General Manager Dai Enji flew to Jiangxi with Li Yingzong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, on the 29th of last month on official business. Dai and Li returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Dai, who spoke to a reporter from Shen Shi She yesterday, his trip was to inspect the business of the Jiujiang air station and survey the Jiujiang land airfield, with no other tasks. The land airfield there has been fully constructed, but the terrain is too low and easily floods, so it may still not be suitable for use. As for the Shanghai-Guangdong route, which has resumed operations, the company has made its greatest efforts during this preparation period to ensure the safety of future flights.</p>

<h3>Frequent Robberies in Cold Weather</h3>
<p>Police Authorities Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>Recently, as the weather has gradually turned cold, petty thieves and bandits have been committing robberies daily due to hunger and cold. Although the city's police agencies have tried their best to prevent them and have conducted strict searches, robberies are still frequently discovered. At around 8:00 PM last night, a certain Mr. Jia was passing by Kunshan Garden on North Sichuan Road when seven bandits suddenly jumped out of the dark from the bushes, holding pistols and shouting at him. They searched him thoroughly and robbed him of over ninety silver dollars before fleeing in all directions. Mr. Jia reported the incident to the police and requested them to pursue the bandits, but the bandits had already disappeared without a trace. It is unknown whether they will be caught. Also, at around 8:00 AM on the same day, three bandits went to rob the Tai Ji Cleaning Bureau near the Fenshui Temple Road in Zhabei. Fortunately, there was no cash in the bureau's accounting office at the time, so only a clerk surnamed Si was robbed of fifteen silver dollars before the bandits fled. The incident was also reported to the local police station, requesting them to pursue the bandits. Although police officers were dispatched to the scene, they were unable to catch the bandits. It is hoped that the police authorities will take precautionary measures and remedy the situation as this harsh winter approaches, so as to prevent bandits from running rampant and ensure the safety of the residents.</p>
<h3>YWCA Fundraising Rally Opens</h3>
<p>Held at Mayor Wu's Private Residence Yesterday</p>
<p>Fundraising Goal Set at Sixty Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the joint fundraising rally of the National Committee of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of China and the Shanghai Municipal Committee was held yesterday (1st) at 4:00 PM at Mayor Wu's private residence at 464 Avenue Haig. More than one hundred people, including members of the fundraising rally committee, advisors, team leaders, and team members, attended the meeting on time. The program included an opening speech by Mrs. Huang Xiufeng, Chairman; a speech by Mr. Kong Buqin on behalf of Mrs. Kong; a speech by Mayor Wu; a speech by Mr. Zhu Youyu; a photo session; and a tea reception. Everyone was in high spirits and very excited. Mayor Wu and Mrs. Wu personally extended warm hospitality, and the event ended happily at 6:00 PM. It was also reported that Mayor Wu immediately pledged to donate one thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Huang's Speech</h3>
<p>It is a great honor to hold the YWCA fundraising rally at the Mayor's residence today. The Mayor and his wife have been very supportive of our association's work, and we express our deep gratitude. We are also grateful to Mrs. Kong and Mrs. Wu for serving as Chairmen of the rally, to the more than one hundred and fifty female leaders who are serving as team leaders and team members, and to the fifteen gentlemen who are serving as our advisors. All of this inspires us. I hope that everyone will work together to achieve our goal.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong's Speech</h3>
<p>Today, because Mrs. Kong is unwell and unable to attend, I am here to join in her place, and I feel very happy. The YWCA is an organization that leads women to fulfill their social work duties. Its work is developing day by day and will soon be widespread throughout the country. It has also gained a considerable position internationally. This fundraising effort has already achieved half its success because of Mayor Wu's help, and with the leaders of various women's groups serving as team leaders and team members, success is even more assured. I hope that we will not only achieve our goal but also exceed it. This is what I wish.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech</h3>
<p>It is a great honor for my wife and I to participate in the opening of the YWCA fundraising rally today. The YWCA has done a lot of work in the past and has made great contributions to society. We express our deep respect. The purpose of this fundraising effort is not only financial, but also to awaken women across the country so that they can participate in the work of the YWCA. Our country is in an era of construction, and if women can share the responsibility of building the country, they must have sound knowledge, ability, and character. The YWCA has already made a significant contribution to this work, and I hope that it will continue to work actively and make even greater contributions. I wish this fundraising effort success.</p>
<h3>Zhu Youyu's Speech</h3>
<p>The YWCA's work has been progressing rapidly recently, advancing a thousand miles a day. Its work has three characteristics: First, the YWCA's work is not conservative, but progressive, adapting to the needs of the times. Second, the YWCA's work is not about treating symptoms and providing emergency relief, but about fundamental social education. Third, it is localized. From the perspective of both funding and personnel, it can be seen that the YWCA has reached the point where Chinese people are taking responsibility themselves. For example, of the 250,000 dollars required annually by the National Committee and local municipal committees, only 10,000 dollars are donated from abroad. All of the staff in various locations are also Chinese. This progress is sufficient to show the Chinese people's understanding of the YWCA's work and the YWCA's ability to deeply penetrate society.</p>
<h3>Liang Tongfang Confesses to Throwing Bomb at Yuelai</h3>
<p>Details of Military Service and Other Work Fully Explained</p>
<p>The Purpose of Throwing the Bomb Was to Warn, Not to Injure</p>
<p>The Guangdong Road Yuelai South Goods Store, owned by Gong Fanglai, was investigated by the Red Blood Assassination Corps and found to be privately importing large quantities of Japanese goods. After repeated warnings were ignored, on October 19th, corps member Liang Tongfang carried a bomb to destroy the store. In addition to Liang injuring himself, store clerks Chuan Rongsheng and Ding Yansheng and several others were injured. Afterwards, the local Zhabei Police Station sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. Liang's injuries were to his left and right hands. Due to the severity of the injuries, doctors amputated two sections of his left finger and the front section of his right arm. After ten days of treatment, his injuries have slightly improved. The police station extracted Liang from the hospital on the 30th and escorted him to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One yesterday morning. The police station only requested permission to detain him for further investigation and did not formally prosecute him. Liang, wearing a hospital uniform with his hands wrapped in white cloth, stood in the defendant's dock. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang first stated the circumstances of the case, saying that Liang had previously served in the 19th Route Army in anti-Japanese work. After the ceasefire agreement was signed, Liang</p>
<h3>Wandered to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Later, he was aided by Tang Haian, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, who introduced him to study at the Dongya Sports Academy. However, Liang's determination to resist Japan had never diminished, and he continued to work, investigating whether stores in Shanghai were selling Japanese goods. After Liang was arrested, police detectives went to the Dongya Sports Academy to investigate and found records of anti-Japanese work and several newspapers with Liang's works published in his luggage. Since Liang had just been discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday, the police station still needs to investigate whether he has political connections. He has not yet been prosecuted. It was found that on the 18th of last month, Liang and his comrades found that the Yuelai South Goods Store was selling Japanese goods. That night, they discussed the matter in Room 68 of the Heming Hotel and prepared to carry a bomb to warn the store the next day. However, the police went to the Heming Hotel to investigate and found that there was no Room 68. The highest room number in the hotel was 46. Therefore, what he said is unreliable, or the number is wrong. Now, please allow a postponement of the trial. Then,</p>
<h3>Yuelai Store Clerk</h3>
<p>Chuan Rongsheng testified that he was 26 years old and from Nanhui. On that day at noon, when I was working at the counter, Liang came to talk to me. Because he spoke with a northern accent, I could not understand what he was saying, so I asked my colleague Ding to talk to him. At that time, Liang threw a paper package on the counter with a loud bang. My fingers and chest were injured. I have recovered slightly now. Ding Yan, a fellow clerk, also testified to the same events. When questioned, Liang Tongfang confessed that the Yuelai South Goods Store was privately importing a lot of Japanese goods, such as abalone and shark fins, and was a wholesale distributor. Smaller south goods stores all wholesale from them. This matter was investigated by the Red Blood Assassination Corps' investigation division, and after repeated warnings were ignored, on the 19th, I carried a bomb there. Previously, I worked as a clerk at the Jinhua Small Money Exchange. After the September 18th Incident, I joined General Ma Zhanshan's army to participate in the anti-Japanese work. Soon after the Shanghai January 28th Incident broke out, I came to Shanghai and joined the 150th Brigade under Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan as a soldier, so that I could work on the ground. Afterwards,</p>
<h3>The Shanghai War Stopped</h3>
<p>I was then assigned to the Third Team in Wuxi for training. Not long after, the team was disbanded, and I followed the Shanghai Student Volunteer Corps and the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army to work outside the customs. In the Battle of Jiukou, we fought for three days and nights, suffering from hunger and cold, struggling through several feet of snow. Later, the army leader, General Zhu Ziqiao, saw our plight and, because we were all from the south and not accustomed to this kind of work, transferred us to the rear in Beiping. I participated in a lot of anti-Japanese work with Brigade Commander Weng. Later, after the Tanggu Truce was established, I went to Xinjiang and other places to continue working. Because that place was a red land with no people, there was no way to move forward, so I had to turn back. On the way, I encountered bandits who robbed all my clothes and other belongings, leaving me with only a undershirt and a pair of underwear. Later, I was able to get to Beiping with the help of the province chairman there and with the assistance of the support association, which gave me more than one hundred silver dollars. I then bought clothes and in October of last year</p>
<h3>Came to Shanghai Alone</h3>
<p>Because I had no work to do, I went to visit lawyer Yao Zhaoli, requesting him to find me a hard job. Because lawyer Yao's sister had been a fellow volunteer with me. In addition to giving me ten dollars, lawyer Yao introduced me to rent a rickshaw. So I started working as a rickshaw puller, earning my own living, which I also found very satisfying. Later, as the national affairs deteriorated, I really felt powerless to reverse the situation. Rather than becoming a slave to a foreign country in the future, I felt it would be cleaner to die now. So I decided to commit suicide. In January of this year, I swallowed opium once, but I was saved by someone. Later, on March 15th, I transferred to Dongya Sports School to study. But since I arrived in Shanghai, I joined the Red Blood Assassination Corps to help with the work. Because the corps' investigation division found that the Yuelai South Goods Store was privately importing large quantities of Japanese goods, I sent them two letters in advance to warn them. At this point, the police lawyer stood up and said that the Yuelai South Goods Store had stated to the police that they had not received any warning letters beforehand, but only received five letters from the outside world on the day after the incident and on the 21st. Liang then continued, "This bomb was brought by me from</p>
<h3>The Northeast</h3>
<p>Hidden along the way, it was not discovered. Because although my body has arrived in Shanghai, my heart to resist Japan has not died, and I am prepared to continue working. The bomb was made by the Hanyang Arsenal and cannot actually kill people. It can only intimidate and injure. So when I went to Yuelai at noon on the 19th, because it was lunch time, the store and the customers would definitely be reduced. When I arrived at the counter, I first loudly told the store clerks to go inside, and then I tore the paper bag to reveal that there was a bomb inside. This is all out of my good intentions, because my purpose in going there was only to warn the store owner, and I did not want to injure anyone. But the store clerks are all stupid, and they didn't understand my Shanghai dialect. At that time, because the safety pin on the bomb had been pulled, and the time had passed several minutes, it fell by itself and exploded. This is the real situation. At the time, I intended to throw the bomb, and if I wanted to hurt people, I could have thrown the bomb into the store, and I could have calmly escaped. I would never have injured myself. My family only has my old mother, who is fifty-four years old, and my old father is disabled." After reviewing the confession, Presiding Judge Feng Shide instructed that the case be postponed for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Electrical Short Circuit in National Goods Showcase</h3>
<p>A Rare Incident in the History of Competition</p>
<p>The China National Huamei Tobacco Company on Nanjing Road, in order to promote the essence of national goods and advocate the art of showcase display, held a National Goods Showcase Display Competition. It has been going on for three months now, and it has been highly praised by people from all walks of life. The sixteenth round involved the Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory participating in the competition. The factory specially hired experts to arrange the display, but suddenly at 4:00 AM, it was burned down due to an electrical short circuit. All the displays were completely destroyed. According to the company's general manager, Jing Yimeng, who spoke to reporters, encountering the god of fire during the progress of the National Goods Showcase Display Competition is a rare incident in the history of competition that will be commemorated in the future, just like a wave in an article. The loss is only three large pieces of glass. They will be able to be installed within a day or two, and Hongxin Factory will continue to display its products. The retail department can resume business as usual in two days. The National Goods Showcase Competition will of course continue without any problems.</p>
<h3>French Police Uncover a Gambling Den</h3>
<p>The French police, both Chinese and foreign detectives, uncovered a gambling den in the four-story building of the Changsha Commercial Firm across from the Big Ben last night. Huang Houan, a well-known gambling boss in Shanghai (nicknamed Zhang Daliuzi), and a Mr. Yan were arrested on the spot. They were escorted to the Second Special District Court today for interrogation. It is reported that there is a plaintiff in the case who was defrauded of two hundred dollars to confront them.</p>
<h3>Extremely Tragic, Vegetable Vendor Commits Suicide by Hanging</h3>
<p>Had Not Eaten for Three Days, Weeping Sadly</p>
<p>Suddenly Committed Suicide One Hour Later</p>
<p>Testimony of Neighbors Who Witnessed It</p>
<p>Xu A, a Ningbo native, 21 years old, lived with his 60-year-old mother, Wang, on the second floor of No. 1036 Dongyouheng Road. The mother and son made a living by selling vegetables. Recently, due to the small amount of capital, the profits from sales have also decreased accordingly. Now, they do not even have enough for three meals a day. The day before yesterday, Xu, after thinking about it, suddenly became indignant and conceived a desire to end his life. While his mother was out, he hanged himself in his residence. Later, Mrs. Niao Adong, the landlady of the second floor, caught a glimpse of him and screamed in horror. Neighbors rushed over upon hearing the sound and helped to take him down, but he was already barely breathing. They reported to the Chinese police at No. 2034 nearby and summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The police reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They then carried the body to the Fei Zhong post-mortem examination office. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor assigned by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuji, and others, arrived at the office to examine the body. The head of the Western police first reported the previous circumstances. Then, after questioning Niao Adong, who testified that she was 37 years old, a Ningbo native, and the landlady of the second floor of the house, she said that at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, she went to her bedroom upstairs to relieve herself and suddenly heard the deceased weeping sadly in the attic. Suspecting something, she went to see him and saw that he was covered in tears. She asked him what was wrong, and he said that he had not eaten a grain of rice for three days, and he had nothing on him, so how could he live. She felt sorry for him, but her own finances were also very tight, and she could not help. She took out ten copper coins from her purse and gave them to him, telling him to buy pancakes to fill his stomach. After comforting him a little, she left. After an hour, she heard no sound from him, so she went to check on him again and discovered that he had hanged himself on a bamboo pole next to the bed. Seeing the sight, she screamed in horror and quickly called the neighbors to take him down and inform his mother, and then reported to the police. Xu Wang, the deceased's mother, also testified to the same events. Prosecutor Tang then ordered that the deceased, Xu A, male, had indeed died by hanging himself before death. The body was handed over to his mother, Xu Wang, who signed a statement and took it back for coffin burial.</p>

<h3>Postponement of the Inauguration Ceremony for the New Building of the Shanghai Buddhist Association's Orphanage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association's Orphanage, located on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, has been established for over a year. The orphanage specializes in taking in poor and orphaned children, providing them with clothing, food, shelter, and education. As a result, the number of children entering the orphanage has been increasing daily. Last year, the director, Guan Tongzhi, along with Qun Kaisheng, and the orphanage directors Du Yuesheng, Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, and Li Yiwei, decided to add two more buildings, which have now been completed. The inauguration ceremony was originally scheduled for the 28th of last month, but due to a lack of time, it has been rescheduled to the 18th of this month. At that time, people from all walks of life will be invited to attend the ceremony.</p>
<h3>The International Hotel is Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The International Hotel, funded by Central Committee Member Wang Zhengting and bankers like Qian Xinzhi, is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month with a capital of 1.1 million yuan. It leases the 22-story building next to the racetrack. The construction of the building has also been completed. A Central News Agency reporter, regarding the building as the tallest in the Far East, interviewed the engineers of the project, including Wu Qingquan. According to them, the land cost 400,000 yuan, construction cost 4.2 million yuan, and interior decoration cost 800,000 yuan. Because it is the tallest building in the Far East, every effort has been made to ensure that the interior and exterior facilities are exquisite and up-to-date. Most of the building's rooms are used for the International Hotel, with an annual rent of 220,000 yuan. The International Hotel has a total of 242 rooms of various sizes. All facilities have been carefully researched over a long period. Even the 170 waiters have undergone ten months of training, costing 24,000 yuan. In addition to fire extinguishers on each floor, the fire protection equipment also includes automatic water sprinklers installed every ten square feet on the ceiling. This equipment is a novelty in Shanghai. When the indoor temperature reaches 160 degrees, the equipment automatically sprays a large amount of water, covering an area of ten square feet per unit. As for the sanitary facilities, every effort has been made to ensure they are complete and up to par, making it one of the best in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Market in the City Center Will Be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>The City Industrial Trust Corporation, to facilitate residents in the city center, has leased over two mu of land from the municipal government at the corner of Minxian Road and Shiguang Road to build a market with 100 stalls and eight shops. The construction of the market and shops has been underway for some time, and the progress is very rapid. Currently, the market's pillars and roof have been erected, and the walls of the shops are also being built. It is expected to be completed within the year. After this, residents in the city center will no longer need to travel far to purchase daily necessities. Therefore, the number of applications for land reclamation in the city center's land bureau has increased significantly, which may be related to this.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Illegally Overcharging Rent Penalized After Investigation by the Rickshaw Committee</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee recently investigated and found that public rickshaws were charging rickshaw pullers more rent than the maximum amount stipulated in the license regulations (currently, the maximum rent is 7 jiao 8 fen per day and night, plus 7 fen for the mutual aid fund). After obtaining sufficient evidence, the committee summoned ten rickshaw owners involved for questioning. According to the license regulations, the licenses of the ten rickshaws could have been revoked entirely. However, considering this was the first offense, leniency was granted, and it was decided to suspend the licenses for one month as a warning.</p>
<h3>The Rickshaw Committee Has Not Approved the Formation of Another Company</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that a "Rickshaw Pullers' Livelihood Relief Rickshaw Company" claimed to comply with the Public Concession's new regulations and requested 2,000 rickshaw licenses for operation. It was reported that the Rickshaw Committee had approved this and that the licenses would be allocated from January 1, 1935. However, according to the Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee, this news is a rumor and is absolutely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>A Crowd Visits the Four-Legged Chicken, a Strange Tale</h3>
<p>Zhang Er'a, a 42-year-old farmer from Qibao Town, Shanghai, and his wife, Mrs. Wang, live by farming. They raise dozens of hens to sell eggs to supplement their income. This spring, when Zhang Er'a was hatching chicks, one of the chicks was born with four legs, staggering as it walked. However, its appetite increased greatly, and it grew rapidly. In just a few months, it weighed over ten catties. Recently, a Mr. Chen from Caohejing Town heard about it and purchased it. For a time, the crowds who came to see it out of curiosity were exceptionally large. This is recorded for the research of physiologists.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle with Pirates off Songkou</h3>
<p>Three Wounded Pirates Transported to Shanghai for Treatment This Morning</p>
<p>At half past midnight this morning, the Water Police Department transported three injured men from the Lanlu Wharf to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was reported that they were sent from Qikou after a fierce battle between pirates and government troops. It was reported that the pirate ship had been sunk and five pirates were killed. Details will be reported tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of a Female Student at Jinan University</h3>
<p>Lan Fuming Fined 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>On September 20th at 10:00 AM, Wu Yongmei, a female student from Pengze, Jiangxi at Zhenru Jinan University, along with female classmates Ouyang Shuhua, Shuxian, and Luo Qiaoyun, planned to go to a photo studio to develop photos. As they walked out of the school gate, about ten storefronts away from the school, tragedy struck. A car driven by Lan Fuming suddenly sped up from behind and crashed into them. Wu was crushed and injured in the head and died despite treatment. The cause of the accident was that Lan Fuming was driving carelessly. When there were pedestrians in front of the car, he should have warned them to avoid it. However, Lan Fuming did not honk the horn and did not listen to the police officer's instructions, resulting in this accident. He was undoubtedly responsible. The case has been debated in the criminal court of the local court. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Shao sentenced Lan Fuming to a fine of 1,000 yuan for negligence causing death as a warning.</p>
<h3>Vita Cimin: Overseas Honors for Life-Saving</h3>
<p>Vita Cimin, a specially made tonic refined by the Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, has been famous worldwide since its launch. Its great efficacy has been praised by users. Last month, Dr. Xiafei, a German pharmacist from the pharmaceutical factory, was invited to the United States to give a lecture entitled "The Principles of Vita Cimin Being Beneficial to Human Life," which was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Mr. Xiafei was warmly welcomed by people in the United States and has given many lectures. Listeners have expressed satisfaction. After the on-site testing by scholars in the United States, the results were excellent, so it has been highly praised by the pharmaceutical industry. It can be said that it is an unprecedented event for domestic Western medicine to receive such high praise overseas. The scientific value of Vita Cimin is evident from this and cannot be compared with other tonics. It is said that the formulation was achieved after decades of research by Dr. Xiafei. It contains valuable ingredients such as the cruciate-shaped endocrine crystals of Shanghai pills and the crystalline endocrine of Vitamin B and ovarian testicular cells. Taking it has great benefits for life. In addition, the factory also has a powerful liver-activating crystalline blood tonic, also invented by Dr. Xiafei, which is also very effective.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Fisheries Trial Field Captures Giant True Dolphin</h3>
<p>Over Ten Feet Long, Weighing 600 Pounds</p>
<p>Planning to Make a Skeletal Specimen for Display</p>
<p>According to the Industry Association, the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Fisheries Trial Field purchased a fishing vessel, "Lianyun," from England last year. Since it has been fishing in the ocean, its results have been remarkable. Recently, the vessel captured a giant true dolphin weighing more than 600 pounds and over ten feet long in the waters near Huabiao Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River. According to Mr. Zhang, a technician from the specimen room, the capture process was very tense because it jumped more strongly than any other fish, so it was not easy to obtain. He is now using scientific methods to make a skeletal specimen for display as research material.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Yongyitang Clinic and Medicine Distribution Center in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The closing ceremony of the Yongyitang Clinic and Medicine Distribution Center in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over a hundred people from all walks of life attended. Jin Fuchun, Chen Yunquan, Xia Botang, Huang Zhihe, Zhu Zhixian, and Wu Qingshen served as the presidium. The meeting began as usual. First, the chairman reported that charitable people had donated over 1,658 yuan and spent over 1,501 yuan, providing 13,561 doses of medicine, 1,544 bottles of medicinal water, and 5,000 plasters. The remaining amount was provided by the hall. Then, Xia Botang, the director of medical affairs, reported that a total of 23,970 diagnoses in Chinese and Western medicine and 736 special diagnoses had been given. Later, Yu Yuqing and Tang Huaiyu proposed improving the methods next year. After the meeting, everyone gathered for a meal and took photos to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Cai Wenyis Appeal Rejected</h3>

<h3>Kangyuan Factory and Times Newspaper Involved in Litigation: Second Trial Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Times Newspaper of this port was prosecuted by the police for publishing news of the Kangyuan Factory's bankruptcy. The second trial was held yesterday. Lawyers Lai Lansheng and Jie Wangmanyun appeared in court for the defendant. According to the plaintiff, Xiang Kangyuan, although the Times Newspaper is a four-page newspaper, it is sold in various ports and has a great influence. After publishing this news, letters and telegrams poured in from various ports, greatly affecting the factory's business reputation. However, after my investigation and the sincere expression of Manager Lai of the newspaper, I deeply understand that the newspaper had no malicious intent. Therefore, I am very understanding of the Times Newspaper and Mr. Lai and have decided not to pursue the private prosecution. However, I request that Mr. Lai cooperate and assist in investigating the name of the contributor and bring them to justice in order to restore the reputation of both the Kangyuan Factory and the Times Newspaper. Lai Lansheng stated that, in addition to expressing his apologies to the Kangyuan Factory and all sectors of society, he should also be subject to legal sanctions for the occurrence of this news. As for the announcement of the contributor, in addition to rectifying the internal scope, due to business and moral considerations, it is not convenient to disclose it. The court ordered a bail of 500 yuan for release pending judgment.</p>

Often, even after graduating from university, they cannot write fluent Chinese, which is a phenomenon of the decline of old Chinese literature in our country. The doctor, in view of this, specially established a lecture in Shanghai to improve our Chinese style and benefit young students. All circles in Shanghai have long believed in the doctor's pure spirit of service to society. The colleagues of this association, whether students of the doctor or close friends of the doctor, should express their appreciation.

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Seeing Poverty in a Cup of Water, a Poor Laborer Protects the Old. Vast Wealth Can Be Obtained, Cunning Officials Unite in Groups.</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiqian really wanted to see the home of the poor, with no other intention. He stretched his head and looked inside the door. A yellow earth kang [platform bed], almost occupied two-thirds of the room. The room was dark and dim, and it was not very clear. It seemed that in the middle of the kang, a tattered gray blanket was laid. Against the corner of the wall were broken wooden basins and broken wicker baskets, and various messy things were piled out. Along the wall, there were seven or eight large and small earthen pots, and more than a dozen paper boxes, all for storing cigarettes and soap. Unexpectedly, when they came to their home, they became decorations. Although there were a few short wooden furniture outside the kang, because they were basically broken, and the light in the room was not good, it was impossible to see what they were. There were two piers stacked with yellow mud bricks on the ground, and two wooden stools were placed on them. Two women were sitting there. There seemed to be a tattered cloth bag next to them. I don't know what they were cleaning up, but they hadn't finished yet. The girl Yueying was half-standing and half-sitting on the edge of the kang. When Zhiqian stretched his head to look, she thought he was looking at her, giggled twice, lowered her head, twisted her body, and hid in the corner. Zhiqian was very embarrassed, as if he had come to see her on purpose. He quickly retracted his body and nodded to Sister Hu, saying: "I'm sorry, I was careless, I didn't expect there were women living inside." Sister Hu smiled and said: "What does it matter if there are women? Our little sister is not afraid of people. Those two are older than me." Cheng Zhiqian knew that she was explaining. She was saying that she didn't avoid the suspicion of men and women, so it didn't matter if they were older than her. However, the longer he lingered here, the more awkward the situation became. While speaking, he had already nodded and walked out. He returned to the back door of Little Western Paradise, still passing through the place where the house was being built, and saw that the workers were continuing to work. (55)</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch of a Temple Fair</h3>
<p>— By Tiansheweng</p>
<p>The people in the mountain villages make a living by farming and fishing. When the autumn harvest comes, the granaries are full, and they drink and sing; men and women, old and young, are all full of joy. When autumn ends and winter comes, although the frost falls and the weather is cold, their fishing boats have to set sail. It is said that; in the clear moonlight and frosty air, ribbonfish come out more often, and it is easier to catch them; during the fishing season, they cannot hide in bed. For the sake of making a living, a small boat drifts on the sea, and small lives can only seek the protection of the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>In the valley, there is a magnificent broken temple with red walls, moss covering the ground, and the statues of gods peeling off. The two corridors of the temple are full of water-lifting wheels and fishing nets, lying horizontally on the muddy ground, fast asleep. This is the usual scene of this broken temple; today is different.</p>
<p>A dark, crowded mass of people; the statue of the god in the niche is wearing a brand-new red robe, and the face of the statue seems to show a proud look. Many, many water-lifting wheels and fishing nets in the two corridors have also woken up; they climb up from the ground and hang upside down under the ceiling, listening to the opera as proudly as the villagers. On the stage, people wearing red and green are humming a deafening Shaoxing tune, humming with great enthusiasm. Many wooden boards are set up next to the stage, with benches placed on the boards. This may be a special box or brothel; therefore, the audience on the boards includes middle-aged women in skirts and buns, and young girls with mountain flowers in their hair. These are all special circumstances in the temple today—it is said to be an annual temple fair.</p>
<p>Public entertainment is needed; the people in the mountain villages, because autumn ends and winter comes, have to go to sea to fish for a living. Small lives are entrusted to the hands of the Bodhisattva; so they piously perform operas to worship the gods, in order to seek the protection of the Bodhisattva. Later, I don't know what happened, taking advantage of the grand festival of the temple fair, many gambling tables were set up in front and behind the broken temple, including pai gow, bronze treasures, green dragons, white tigers, entering the gate, and exiting the gate. The crowds were immense and extremely lively. It is pitiful that the ignorant villagers, farming, fishing, and chopping firewood, spend all the hard-earned money they get from their sweat and blood all year round on the gambling tables. Is this kind of public entertainment, like a temple fair, necessary?</p>
<p>The sea tide pounds onto the sandy beach; the mountain wind roars and disrupts the pine and fir trees on the ridge; it is like this every day. The temple fair, it's just an annual carnival!</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Qin Fang)</p>
<p>There is no one in the world who pays money and does not take goods. But students who pay tuition are willing to take holidays. There are many unemployed workers in the United States because of the development of machinery. Many Chinese long gown friends are unemployed. Perhaps it is caused by the development of schools.</p>
<p>Moths pursue light and are willing to sacrifice their lives. Fireflies emit light and do not mind being weak.</p>
<h3>The Soul of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Wolfo</p>
<p>Calling back the national soul of the Republic of China is recognized by everyone as the most urgent task before the Chinese people. Indeed, the national soul of the Republic of China has been missing for a long time. If it is not quickly called back, the future is full of infinite dangers. However, to call back the national soul, one must first call back the human soul. This is very easy to understand. The national soul of China is a great soul that is condensed from the human souls of China's 450 million people. The reason why the national soul is lost is because the human soul was lost first, as the saying goes, the soul is not attached to the body. Look at the Chinese people in front of you, aren't most of them with their souls not attached to their bodies?</p>
<p>Why is this soul not attached to its body? Did the soul run away? No. Did the soul break away from its relationship with it? No. Did the soul get snatched away? No, then, is the soul lost? Not entirely. The reason why the soul is not attached to the body is that most of it is sold, and the second is that it is released by itself. Releasing one's soul is like what the ancient sages called "releasing the heart." The formation of the great disaster in China today lies in the selling and releasing of the soul.</p>
<p>How do you call it releasing the soul by oneself? For example, a student who goes to school to study. Since he goes to school to learn, then his soul should be in the school, should be on the books. However, some students prefer to put their souls in coffee shops, dance halls, and... this is called releasing, which is unconditional. As for what it means to sell the soul, let's take a traitor and a treacherous merchant as an example. Originally, a traitor and a treacherous merchant are also Chinese people. Knowing that they want to get high positions and generous rewards, and want to make huge profits, in short, in order to get rich, even though their bodies are Chinese, their souls have been sold to foreigners. This is called selling, which is conditional. Although the above is just to give a couple of examples, you must know that there are many other ways of releasing and selling the soul. Because there are too many people who release their souls and sell their souls, the national soul of China has also been lost, lost to this day.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to call back the national soul, but it is especially important to call back the human soul.</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>So when I followed Guangxu and Longyu in, I saw familiar faces everywhere. The layout was almost the same as the imperial palace in Beijing, which made me almost suspect that I had never been to Fengtian; only the style of a few large buildings was completely different from that of Beijing.</p>
<p>At that time, I was not allowed enough time to observe carefully, but only saw a general situation, and was busy preparing to welcome the emperor. I didn't have anything to prepare, but everyone was in a hurry, so I couldn't be idle. Among them, the most hectic was that band of ancient musicians. They first assembled the racks for the musical instruments, each stood in a suitable position, and then let their assistants pick out several applied musical instruments from the racks and give them to them. — These so-called applied musical instruments are cymbals, gongs, and small drums, etc.; of course, there is also the nine-tone gong. — After each of them held the applied musical instruments in their hands, the preparations for welcoming the emperor were completed; then a eunuch ran out of the palace to inform Li Lianying, who was waiting alone with the Empress Dowager outside the gate, that everything was ready inside.</p>
<p>Then, another eunuch rolled in like a bouncing ball and reported to us: "The Empress Dowager has started!"</p>
<p>As soon as this news arrived, the music began to play immediately, and the whole courtyard knelt down. Guangxu knelt beside the few marble steps in the center, so that when the Empress Dowager got out of the sedan, he would be the closest person kneeling to the Empress Dowager. Behind him knelt Longyu and Consort Jin in turn; behind the two of them, as usual, were my eight female officials. Our eight people did not distinguish what order, who was in front, who was in the back, each could be determined according to their own meaning, and was not subject to any restraint. (165)</p>
<h3>Bestowing Health and Beauty on Brothers Jiang Zhi and Huang Yunhuan</h3>
<p>— A Poet of Great China</p>
<p>What is considered beautiful? Only health. Look at my two brothers, Jiang and Huang. Their bodies are well-proportioned, and their chests broad. Their muscles are rosy and filled with blood. Their eyes are bright and clear, with long eyelashes. They compare well with European women in appearance. Our ancestors valued men and often belittled and harmed women. They considered weakness beautiful, with powdered and delicate makeup. What is the appropriate preference for the masses? A frail girl like Lin Daiyu? That is merely hair-like lust. Ellis explains this in detail. Times have changed, and the phoenix soars. All culture and art are being re-established. Painters oppose changing Qi Xiang (a historical era). Poets overthrow the false Song and Tang dynasties. Who are the modern Xi Shi (famous beauty) and Wang Qiang (another famous beauty)? Look at my two brothers, Jiang and Huang.</p>
<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3>Autumn Melodies at Tianping</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The motorboat departed from Mingxin Bridge, and that flower-like Suzhou city drifted leisurely away. The cool morning breeze from the upstream canal stirred my hair, indeed a taste of autumn. When Dai Yuan came to meet our group of people, a blood-red sunrise, brighter than gold and as small as a chicken egg, was caught in the city walls, as if peeking at people from the willow leaves. This spiritual orb, condensing the world's light, magically transformed, growing larger and larger, increasingly pale, finally casting a sheet of silver, so dazzling! Scattered across the canal's surface, the waves all turned to quicksilver, and we breathed in quicksilver.</p>
<p>Tieling Pass looked like a brick fortress in a painting. Maple Bridge Town was also extremely impoverished. As our boat passed, we heard neither the bells of Zhaishan Temple nor saw the fishing nets on the river. In this ancient temple, made famous by Zhang Ji's poem "Night Mooring at Maple Bridge", I had previously walked through island reeds and overgrown weeds, but now I had no interest in touching the memorial stone again.</p>
<p>Listening to the wind and water along the way, we arrived at Boyin Village. Upon seeing the mountains all around, my companions cheered, especially the young ladies, their faces beaming, vying with each other to disembark. As many small white triangular flags fluttered in the five-person columns, these well-mannered female students in uniform resembled a beautiful chain, quickly proceeding upstream on Kua Street. Barefoot, middle-aged, lazy women with fiery yellow wan-zhi flowers in their hair buns, though pursuing us with their hands behind their backs, wanting us to sit in their mountain sedan chairs without fearing trouble, were all refused. If one must borrow someone else's legs to hike, what fun is there?</p>
<p>Reaching a place, surrounded by mountains, we were enclosed in the center. In the southeast corner, a mountain recess was revealed, floating with faint green traces – I wondered what peaks they were. Going up from here, we saw the boy-shaped gate built of yellow stone. Because it was a long ridge, the white sand road resembled a swimming snake. Standing in the wind cave of the boy-shaped gate and pointing to the ring of purplish-gray brick walls below, we knew that the Gao Yi Garden, full of pine trees, was near. Circling down along the walls, sweating for about twenty minutes, under the shade of the large ginkgo trees at the foot of Tianping Mountain, we saw a woodcutter taking off his raincoat and hanging it on a short pine tree, smoking his dry tobacco, which cleverly evoked a poetic realm.</p>
<p>Inside the Nine Pine Pavilion, the Qianlong Emperor's inscribed stone was covered in dust and withered leaves, and we did not see the emperor's calligraphy. However, I fundamentally dislike this Qing emperor who showed off his cleverness and artificially sought a romantic style.</p>
<p>Entering Fan Gong's ancestral hall, we jumped onto the stone steps from the side room and went up in winding circles. The Parrot Stone, although it looked a bit like a spiritual bird pecking at leftover red millet, was not as similar in shape as the Ji Dian Stone in the West Garden.</p>
<p>Resting for a while in the Wangshan Tower at the Cup and Spoon Spring, pushing open the southern wrist railing, the distant and nearby green trees and yellow rice waves, along with the clouds and mountains in half the sky and the pine wind in the entire valley, flew into our eyes and ears. Two years ago, sitting quietly in this tower, sipping the clear spring water and discussing Zen with the old monk, I had the fleeting thought of a monastic life. Last year, at the Flying Cloud Pavilion in Yuantouzhu, watching the lake sails with Manli, I recovered my spirit of enterprise and continued to move forward tirelessly.</p>
<p>I loved the English and Chinese poems written by Zhang Tingji (Shuwei) and his Western friend when they visited Tianping, hanging in the Zen room, but because I was in a hurry to leave, I didn't copy them down, which was a pity. Later, leaving the Cup and Spoon Spring, we went to One-Line-Sky. This is where the two walls are steep and narrow, with stone steps in the middle, wide enough for only one person to pass through, and people with too thick waists cannot walk. It is different from the ray of sunlight in the Jade Milk Cave of Lingyin Temple. We climbed up the narrow stone crevices one by one. If you looked from the foot of the mountain, we must have looked like tiny beans. Passing through One-Line-Sky and then climbing straight up to Baiyun on dangerous steps, we were breathing hard, and a large group of urgent crows combined to form a loud sound and mist. Standing on the mountaintop, overlooking the small city of ancient Wu, the village trees in the suburbs, and the green mountains and fields, I truly felt the spirit of standing on Mount Tai – the mountain wind rushed against my clothes, and even though the sun was scorching my skin, I could hardly bear the new coolness in my jacket, so I waved the triangular flags and urged my companions to descend. Because the stone path was very slanted, we carefully felt the walls as we descended. Looking at the square pagoda on Lingyan Mountain, I couldn't help but think of the braised fish at the Shi Family Restaurant in Mudu Town, swallowing a mouthful of saliva.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Recent Improvements to Specialized Schools and Above by the Ministry of Education (3)</h3>
<p>3\. Restricting Concurrent Positions and Teaching Loads for Faculty and Staff: According to statistics from the 20th academic year, there were a total of 7,053 teachers in specialized schools and above nationwide, of which 4,244 were full-time, accounting for 60%; 928 held concurrent positions within the school, accounting for 18.2%; and 2,921 held concurrent positions outside the school, accounting for 21.8%. There were a total of 4,234 staff members, of which 3,196 were full-time, accounting for 75.5%; 920 held concurrent positions within the school, accounting for 21.7%; and 108 held concurrent positions outside the school, accounting for 2.8%. In total, excluding the 920 faculty and staff members holding concurrent positions, the actual number of faculty and staff was 10,367. The total number of full-time faculty and staff was 7,440, accounting for 67.7%, and the total number holding concurrent positions outside the school was 3,029, accounting for 12.3%. The rest held concurrent positions within the school. In order to improve teaching efficiency, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders to national universities, requiring a reduction in staff as appropriate, and prohibiting professors from holding concurrent positions in other schools or other colleges within the same school. If there are special circumstances that make it necessary to hold a concurrent position, it should be limited to a maximum of six hours per week. Deans, department heads, and other important responsible persons are absolutely prohibited from holding concurrent teaching positions outside the school, and those who hold concurrent teaching positions within the school will not receive concurrent pay. For private specialized schools and above, the number of part-time teachers is also strictly limited to no more than one-third of the total number of teachers. It is now planned to develop specific restrictive measures in detail to continue the rectification.</p>
<p>4\. Revising Curriculum Standards for Junior Colleges: According to statistics from the 20th academic year, the maximum number of courses offered exceeded 600, with an average of about 120 hours per school; the minimum was about 20 hours. The average was about 380 hours per school. The maximum number of practical hours was over 1,000, while the minimum was only one or two hours, or even none. From this, it can be seen that the types of courses offered by each school are extremely complex, and the number of teaching and practical hours is extremely inconsistent. Some schools offer courses based on the availability of personnel or compete to offer novel courses, often dividing one course into several, while basic and major courses are missing. Since there are no fixed standards for offering courses, there is also no fixed procedure for selecting courses, resulting in increasingly uneven student levels. The Ministry of Education began revising curriculum standards for specialized schools and above two years ago, but this work is extremely difficult and cannot be completed in a short period of time. The curriculum standards for medical schools and specialized medical schools have now been drafted by the Medical Education Committee, and the outlines have been completely decided. Only the details still need to be reviewed by experts. One point in the draft curriculum standards for medical schools and specialized medical schools that is particularly noteworthy is the increased number of practical and clinical hours, with accompanying equipment standards. Curriculum standards for other colleges and specialized schools will also be gradually drafted by the Ministry, hiring experts to discuss them. For colleges and specialized schools of science, agriculture, and engineering, special attention should also be paid to practical training. We believe that the curriculum standards for universities and specialized schools should not be trivial and rigid. When drafting them, more room for flexibility should be left, and they should be revised every few years after implementation to keep them in line with the needs of reality and the progress of science.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Implementing National Revitalization through Rural Construction</h3>
<p>Key Points Passed by the China Rural Education Society</p>
<p>The China Rural Education Society held a meeting in Jinan for several days last time and passed important proposals, namely, revitalizing the nation through rural construction. Recently, the society's council held a meeting in Beijing and passed a plan to implement national revitalization through rural construction. This plan is extremely important and will soon be submitted by the society to the Ministry of Education for circulation to social education institutions in all provinces and cities for implementation. The key points of the plan are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(A) Social Education Should Focus on Rural Construction: Because the society of China is mostly a rural society, and most of the Chinese people are rural people, those who have engaged in social education or popular education have long felt the importance of rural work and have made considerable efforts. The society's previous annual meeting further resolved to propose a plan to revitalize the nation through rural construction. Although the overall implementation plan is still under discussion, there is no doubt that the focus of social education work should shift to rural areas in the future. Therefore, we have the following suggestions: 1. Increased and allocated funding: Efforts should be made to continue increasing social education funding in the future, and the newly added funding should be allocated to rural areas as much as possible. Rural social education institutions should not be large in themselves, and the allocation of their funding should not be based on the size of the institution but should be based on estimating the scope and number of people affected by the work, and determining an appropriate ratio. 2. Establishment of institutions: Newly added social education institutions in the future should be established in rural areas as much as possible. Institutions originally established in cities should be moved to rural areas when possible, or establish branches or districts in rural areas to carry out their work. At the same time, other education institutions should also find ways to carry out rural construction work. 3. Talent training: Talents trained for social education in the future should be truly prepared for rural service. The curriculum and life cultivation should pay attention to (Zi) understanding the status of rural areas in the entire nation and the impact of global economic forces, deepening their awareness of striving for the nation and their faith and willingness to revitalize the nation through rural construction; (Chou) practicing the content of rural production technology and social organization activities, and methods of command and promotion; (Yin) experiencing the suffering of rural areas, enduring hardship and working hard, and creating their own new lives.</p>
<p>(B) Several Principles for Implementing Social Education: 1. Purpose: To cultivate several basic strengths of the people, especially the strengths of production and organization, so that they can gradually improve their own lives with their own strength, and strive to use the countryside as a starting point to enable the entire nation to restore the national spirit with its own strength. 2. Content: The main thing is the new production tools and technologies and new social organization methods and activities that the countryside urgently needs at this time. 3. Method: It is also nothing more than using people who are trusted by the local people (if there are no such talents locally, then methods should be found to train them) to guide and promote. The use of these tools, technologies, methods, and activities allows the people to know by doing and learn by doing in the process of continuous use. The individual methods of guidance and promotion cannot be listed here. The following are a few common examples: (Zi) Grasp practical life problems, such as improving seeds, farm tools, and farming methods due to a shortage of agricultural products, organizing cooperative marketing due to merchant monopoly, building dikes and dredging rivers due to floods and droughts, building bridges and roads due to transportation difficulties, and training self-defense due to banditry, and guiding public health due to epidemics. All facilities should start from the pressing problems that farmers themselves feel. (Chou) Consider the inherent experience of farmers. If the new tools, technologies, and social organization methods and activities are too far from the inherent life experience of farmers, they will not be able to accept them and will not be able to use them. They should be guided and persuaded from what they can do to what they cannot do, and from what they know to what they do not know, based on their inherent experience. (Yin) Pay attention to demonstrations. The introduction and promotion of new tools and technologies should first have concrete evidence of their usefulness. Farmers will naturally be happy to use them if they understand them. Oral explanations are certainly not enough, and written communication is sometimes even more futile. (Mao) Arouse initiative. For new social organizations, such as cooperatives and self-defense groups, help farmers initiate them themselves and try them out themselves. Avoid being代辦, and even if you cannot avoid代辦, you should try to get them to participate. When the time is right, they should be completely maintained by the farmers themselves. (Chen) Show achievements, such as exhibitions of agricultural, livestock, or handicraft products, the completion of roads, bridges, or other projects, and self-defense exercises, there should be grand gatherings in the countryside. The meaning is not to boast about the achievements of the instructors, but to make the people feel the satisfaction of their own success in the observation and encouragement, discover their own possible strength, and thus be more willing to continue to increase their strength.</p>
<p>(C) Using the Strength of Social Education Itself: The opportunities and groups for social education are often unable to generate great strength due to their separate and dispersed nature. In order to make the scattered gradually complete and the separated gradually concentrated, we can only enable agencies and groups to have close contact and connection with each other in a common direction and common work. Only connection and only organization can produce strength. Therefore, we dare to say that we also suggest the following points: 1. Focus on the entire nation. When we each strive to improve a rural work or a village, we must pay attention to the connection between this village and the entire nation, and even the connection with the world's economic and political forces, in accordance with this common direction. In this connection, the village is not an isolated and isolated unit. We should not be satisfied with solving local problems for all facilities, but should consider their impact on the problems of the entire nation. 2. Identify the work center. At a certain time, we should consider our own ability and, based on the needs of the countryside, identify cultivating the strength of the people's production and organization as the center of work, and concentrate our energy to solve it. All aimless extravagance and unnecessary publicity are a waste of strength and should be avoided as much as possible. 3. Division of labor and cooperation. We must try our best to obtain effective contact with economic and political agencies. Even our larger-scale research and experimental institutions must seek possible contact with other cultural and academic institutions to gather relevant efforts on the issue of rural construction, each doing its best, dividing labor and cooperating. 4. Expand the organization. Social education institutions themselves, whether in terms of region, such as the connection between villages and districts, or in terms of work units, such as each cooperative and each self-defense group, should gradually connect and gradually expand their organization. Provincial social education institutions, social education guidance institutions, and larger county-level social education institutions should all take on the responsibility of connecting and organizing.</p>

<h3>Gold Price under Financial Depression</h3>
<p>Initially Firm, Then Weak, Slight Drop of 1.2 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the price of pure gold fell in the gold market yesterday, the silver market continued to shrink, and people's hearts were divided. The market situation remained hovering, and the exchange rate changed from tight to light, resulting in a continued decline. In the early morning, the overseas silver market fell uniformly in the UK and the US, and the forward silver market also fell by 1.5% to 4.5%. The exchange rate slightly shrank, and the price of London raw gold fell by 3.5 pence. People's hearts remained stable. In off-site preparatory trading, it opened up to 91.2 yuan. Then, as the Central Bank's listing was announced, the UK and the US were both flat, and the customs gold fell by 4%, retreating into the 90 yuan mark. After opening, large households had quite a bit of buying, gradually rising to over 90 yuan. However, due to the bank's force to block shillings, it still fell back. It was expected that the HSBC Bank's listing would be announced, with the UK flat and the US shrinking by 0.0625, rising to within 90 yuan at one point. Then, due to the slight hardening of the domestic market, it fell, but the bank still scooped up at a low price, stabilizing after falling. The Central Bank's white silver balance tax was announced, retreating to 7.25%, which was 0.25% lower than the previous day. People's hearts were not satisfied, and it rose to over 90 yuan. It is estimated that the overseas silver market has fallen, and the balance tax is only 0.25%. It seems that the rising market should be tightened. In the end, due to the diligent supply of sources at a high price, it gradually went downstream. The turnover in the morning was sparse, the market situation was loose, and it was extremely sluggish. After the market opened in the afternoon, the buying interest was quite strong. It was said that a certain bank was buying vigorously and stabilized it.

However, large households bought up at a low price, which was still supportable. Later, as the first report of Indian silver was 8 anna long, there was still a downward trend, but the downward trend was not strong. The Daily Bank scooped up and closed at a low price, returning after falling. After this, the second report of Indian silver came without any movement. People's hearts were calm and lacking change.

<h3>A Sudden Plunge in Gold Chicken Yarn: Two Dollars and Sixty Cents</h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for labeled yarn was weak, due to weak American cotton prices. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and selling pressure suddenly intensified. Furthermore, many bulls in the banking sector were cutting their positions, leading to a significant loosening of the market.

The Exchange will collect from one party for all two-way accounts, as announced in the city market.</p>
<h3>Complex Situation for Near and Distant American Cotton Futures</h3>
<p>October Contract Falls Another 26 Points</p>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding the potential restrictions on American cotton production next year has complicated the situation for near and distant futures. Traders are confused. The old cotton market price only fell by 6 to 14 points, while the new cotton market fell by 26 points. The supply from the South is minimal, and the needs of various parties are slow. Consumption and exports are both extremely poor, leading to divided opinions. The general view is that the government's collection of large quantities of pledged cotton will eventually have to be released, shaking confidence and causing market conditions to weaken. British cotton futures fell by 1 to 3 points. Indian cotton was cheaper due to sales by European exporters and Japanese traders, with Pingor and Bai Luo Xi falling by half a rupee, and Ao Fu La rising by two and a half cents.

<h3>Private Estimates of American Cotton</h3>
<p>New York, 31st - The White Company's estimate of new cotton production for this season is 9,617,000 bales, with 7,721,000 bales ginned. The previous estimate (September 27th) was 9,667,000 bales.</p>
<h3>The Swift Agreement on a Ship of Australian Wheat Caused a Dramatic Decline in Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour Falls 7.5 to 8.5 Cents</p>
<p>Wheat Falls 16 to 20 Cents</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month initially stabilized before experiencing a significant decline. The price of imported wheat was good by about 0.3 dollars the day before, but 0.1 dollars lower yesterday. Therefore, investor sentiment was quite firm at the opening, better by 1 to 2 cents compared to the closing price at the end of the previous month. However, after the second round, a sharp decline suddenly occurred. It was rumored that a major factory had agreed to purchase a ship of Australian wheat, with a price of only 4.93 dollars for immediate loading. Upon hearing this news, speculators in the market frantically sold off their holdings, and external bulls also aggressively exited their positions, causing the market to teeter on the brink of collapse. By the afternoon opening, the selling pressure from outside the market had intensified, and even some factories were offering to sell. In addition, the wheat market was also unstable, causing prices to fall sharply. This phenomenon was entirely driven by the agreement on the imported wheat. In terms of actual sales, the Nanyang group had some business, which should not have led to such a sharp decline. As a result, the current month fell by 7.25 cents compared to the end of the previous month, December fell by 8.5 cents, January fell by 7 cents, February fell by 7.25 cents, March fell by 8.25 cents, and April initially opened at 48.75 cents, closing at 40 cents.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the prices for each month initially remained flat before experiencing a decline. The price of imported wheat fluctuated little over the two days, so investor sentiment was still stable at the opening. Gradually, internal bulls started to withdraw, and the flour market also began to decline after the opening. Furthermore, there were reports of continued transactions for imported wheat, leading to increasingly active selling by those in the industry. The market also gradually loosened and declined. By the afternoon opening, near-term sentiment saw a sharp decline, as the Australian wheat agreement allowed for immediate loading, making it difficult to support the future price. Therefore, selling was particularly active, and the decline even reached 0.2 dollars, which is rare in recent times. As a result, the current month fell by a significant 0.2 dollars, December fell by 0.18 dollars, January fell by 0.14 dollars, and February fell by 0.16 dollars. There were no comparisons for the remaining months. Spot wheat prices remained firm due to strong factory demand. Shandong Xuzhou Yaowan Bengbu wheat was quoted at 3.86 dollars, and second-grade wheat was quoted at 3.84 dollars, with a total of 40,000 bags purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Purchases Made When American Wheat Fell</h3>
<p>Due to Overall Poor Harvests</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market remains under the influence of foreign market conditions. The Canadian government's threat to limit speculative trading on the Winnipeg exchange still weighs on traders' minds. The news of the upcoming launch of Argentine new corn is also unfavorable. In addition, sluggish foreign market conditions and a large surplus of Canadian wheat have led to a fall of over one cent in wheat prices. Many purchases were made at low prices, and prices rebounded. The general expectation is that the wheat and corn harvest estimates to be released today will be bullish.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Su Tong Japonica Rice is Scarce, Prices Are Good by 0.1 Dollars</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of goods for various groups has slightly increased, with a total of over ten entities arriving (over six thousand piculs of goods). Activity is still seen on this street, but demand from out-of-town groups has suddenly weakened. The market for various types of newly harvested thin rice, such as Kiln Six, remains similar to the old market for wild white rice. Only the Japonica rice from Changbang Su Tongbang and others saw sellers taking advantage of the scarcity to raise prices, increasing by one foot. While those with high-quality rushes show a slight improvement, those in the middle market are generally unstable. Yangjian goods are falling with no market. Yin Yuan wine merchants continue to operate, but the supply of goods is too strong, resulting in an oversupply and prices falling by about 0.2 dollars. Bian Yuan, on the other hand, is showing improvement due to a lack of goods. Kiln swaps are only selling 50 packages to the Qingdao group.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over twenty entities came from various groups in the He Xia area. Various goods in the market are in demand, with newly harvested Japonica, newly harvested Yang Xian, early thin rice, Chen Bai Yuan, and Yin Yuan rice selling well. Broken Japonica rice is slightly sluggish. New Chen Bu Ke Jian continues to transform. The market shape is solid for newly harvested Japonica, newly harvested Yang Xian, early thin rice. Xin Du Jian added nearly a corner, Chen Baiyuan added about one corner, Broken Japonica Yin Yuan price shape is flat, and Xin Chen Bu Ke Jian price added a corner.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Rebounds After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market initially fell because the foreign exchange rate suddenly rose to 0.12 dollars, and there was a trend of tightening credit. The market also fabricated rumors of a large amount of cash being transported to Beijing. It can be said that this was a case of chasing shadows. In fact, the foreign exchange rate was a temporary phenomenon. As the situation improves, the bond market will trend higher. Therefore, yesterday, the market initially loosened and fell, but then quickly rebounded and rose higher. The future situation is still chaotic. Yesterday, many retail investors sold off their holdings at the opening, with the number of compilation staff decreasing sharply by four and a half cents, and the rest decreasing by small amounts of two, three cents. Eight newly organized companies entered the market, with over one million in demand. The second round saw a consistent rebound of two, three cents, but trading was not active. In the afternoon, trading became even quieter, and market prices remained firm. The opening was better by one, two cents, and the closing was slightly chaotic, with varying highs and lows, but there was no sign of weakness. According to a thorough reading of the environment, there may not be any major changes in the short term, so market prices may still not be able to escape the range of consolidation. As a result, market prices were slightly better by 0.05, 0.1 to 0.2 dollars. The total turnover was 1,168,500 yuan. The stock turnover was ten shares. The rise and fall are listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share)</p>
<h3>The Chaoqing Sugar Market Continued to Open With Over Five Hundred Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, because sales are still sluggish, so although there are firm expectations of tariffs, there is no hope of a rebound. The association's price for No. 24 coarse sand white spot ordinary is still called at 18.8 yuan, not transacted. The price of this warehouse's goods is 18.9 yuan, slightly transacted. The price of transit goods is called at 5.55 yuan, also no transaction. Ordinary No. 8 and 9 He Chi is 14.05 yuan, not much trading. Transit goods are called at 5.1 yuan, not transacted. The price of this factory's refined white Zhenyu No. 1 is 17.2 yuan, stable. The price board has Guangdong gangs opening dozens of bags of Nali White, the price is 18 yuan. The Chao Gang opened over five hundred bags of Chao Jin yesterday, the price of white bags is 13.5 yuan, the price of ordinary oil bag Huang Gangqing is 12.8 to 7.65 yuan, the price of oil bag Long Gangqing is 11.4 to 3 yuan, there is not much change compared to before, the trend is stable.</p>

<h3>Slapping Life in the Face</h3>
<p>— Gu Xi</p>
<p>One should adopt a tough and courageous attitude towards life—as if to slap it in the face!</p>
<p>In this era, life seems to loom over us, acting as our enemy. When facing an enemy, you cannot hesitate to raise your hand. Shouldn't you muster all your strength, almost to the point of storming the gate?</p>
<p>Living is simply warfare! It seems that Hakuson Kuriyagawa once said such a thing. Someone who understands the profound meaning of survival, I believe, will understand that this statement is a truth. If you don't have the courage to slap life in the face, life—in turn—will slap you in the face!</p>
<p>This act of slapping life in the face can be considered a heroic act of living. Someone who lives not merely for the sake of living should possess this kind of heroic action, constantly placing themselves in battle!</p>
<p>How many martyrs are recorded in the history of human revolution who, in seeking a full life and a genuine existence, slapped life in the face? Slapping life in the face is the beginning of storming the gate of existence. The consequences of this beginning may even lead to one's own destruction. However, for the sake of understanding true existence, for the sake of deeply understanding the intense meaning of living, even knowing that this might lead to sacrificing oneself, those who die for this reason, even when on the execution ground (seeing their own blood about to spurt), still smile, and do so without hesitation, right?</p>
<p>Love truth, live faithfully! This is the attitude towards life that everyone who isn't confused should embrace! If there are any obstacles that would offend truth or destroy genuine existence, we should not hesitate to extend our hand and slap the old system containing these obstacles in the face! Furthermore, we must be prepared to sacrifice ourselves if necessary.</p>
<p>Daring to slap in this way, and being prepared to sacrifice oneself in the end, is the most precious heroic act in human history! The further advancement of humanity depends entirely on this!</p>
<p>In order to live in truth and freedom, we should constantly maintain a tough and courageous posture. We must embrace the world with a more expansive heart, to deeply love the world, so that you may obtain a full life!</p>
<p>As long as we live, we should stand tall, walk with firm steps, and climb to the highest peaks of life, so that every moment of our existence expresses the intense meaning of life. I think this kind of effort is justified!</p>
<p>Even if life presents you with endless suffering, you should not flinch! You must face life directly and dare to engage in profound struggles, as a courageous warrior of life. You should possess the kind of indomitable spirit that Gorky spoke of—that even death doesn't matter, we must walk with truth! Only then will you not be a coward who yields to life!</p>
<p>The current hardship is your opponent,</p>
<p>Use all your strength to struggle with it,</p>
<p>Exhausting you so that every hair on your body holds a bead of sweat,</p>
<p>But you must grit your teeth and dare not be careless…</p>
<p>In this way, you live with a bit of stubbornness,</p>
<p>Full of bitterness, but in the bitterness is your unique true taste!</p>
<p>(Zang Kejia: Life)</p>
<p>Precisely because the hardships of life currently resemble an enemy to us, we should not show weakness. We must grit our teeth and struggle with it, daring not to be careless! Someone who deeply loves genuine living will never compromise or yield to life!</p>
<p>The famous writer A. Neverov, in his short story "I Want to Live," said with great passion: "My love for life leads me to battle! I go to die because I want to live!..." These aphorisms reveal to us almost exactly what I said earlier: that one should adopt a tough and courageous attitude towards life—as if to slap it in the face!</p>
<p>In any case, in this era, it is necessary to face life with this attitude, to take on the attitude of daring to slap it in the face! Furthermore, when necessary, slapping life in the face once is not the end of the matter!</p>
<h3>Landlord</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>As the autumn rain gradually drove away the scorching heat, the apartments in several nearby schools, all bearing the sign of "accommodating students," were all declared full. My long-term residence became a problem. Every day, I looked for housing rental advertisements in the newspapers, and eventually discovered a newly established apartment-style dormitory. It wasn't too far from school, but it was still about two miles away, so I decided to take a look.</p>
<p>I leaned my bicycle against the wall of the outer courtyard, where the mud tracks on the tires stopped. After the doorman announced me, a plump middle-aged man in his thirties came out. He had apparently been a staff member at a middle school, but now, unable to endure the hardship, he had fancifully changed careers to run this dormitory. I looked at his protruding belly and his thick eyebrows, which almost met, and couldn't find a trace of the literary temperament supposedly possessed by scholars, and I felt very happy.</p>
<p>There were shared rooms and single rooms. He led me to look at the front yard and the back yard, telling me the rent. He said that the single rooms were seven dollars a month, not including meals, and you had to add two dollars for electricity and water. I laughed inwardly, thinking that this was tantamount to forced inclusion. Because I was afraid of the chatter of too many people, I decided to bite the bullet and book a single room. A person accustomed to solitude would find it headache-inducing to be in the midst of everyone's laughter and chatter.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, I brought my simple luggage and moved in. The sun in the room was surprisingly hot, but the windows couldn't be closed. The rain in the previous few days had caused the water to rise greatly. In the evening, I concentrated on unpacking my basket and taking out my belongings. Thanks to the tea boy's kindness, I was notified that the lights would be turned off in ten minutes. The time was 9:50. I looked at the regulations:</p>
<p>"Aren't the lights supposed to be turned off at 12:00 on Saturdays and Sundays?"</p>
<p>"No, the landlord here just changed it. Weekends are the same as weekdays now."</p>
<p>I groped in the dark for the bedding and pillows in my luggage.</p>
<p>At mealtime, I slowly became acquainted with a few other residents. Everyone frowned and smiled at the dishes, which were like vegetarian food without oil. Those who liked to eat pork ran to the kitchen to ask the chef:</p>
<p>"Isn't pork one dollar and fifty cents a pound?"</p>
<p>"The landlord restricts the money, I'm doing as I'm told. You can't blame me, who wouldn't want to make good dishes!"</p>
<p>Everyone kept quiet. In the evening, I ate salted vegetables to go with my rice, because only two meals were included. In the morning, there were vendors selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks at the entrance.</p>
<p>Every day, people came to look at the rooms. The fat landlord led them around, and his professional jargon increased more and more. Several people complained that there wasn't enough space in the single rooms and didn't want to move in.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the landlord led a foreman to measure the rooms, preparing to create more single rooms. When measuring the room next to this small room, he complained that dividing it into three rooms was too small, but two rooms were too big. This troubled the shrewd landlord, so he came to my door:</p>
<p>"Could you, ah, I'm very sorry, move the wall of this room in one or two feet? His face was blushing with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Why be uncooperative? I generously relented. In return, I received several breathless thank-yous. The small eyes covered by thick eyebrows were shining, and he strode off to inform the craftsmen.</p>
<p>When I came back today, the courtyard was filled with the sound of carpenters hammering and sawing, which reminded me of how the man across the street had been forced to stop talking the other day, because the landlord's child was napping, and the short woman with yellow hair had come out and glared at him. Today, however, the entire courtyard was in an uproar. I went into my room and put down my bag. Hey, my room had been cut off by more than two feet! It was taking up the space where I used to put my bicycle. Bicycles weren't allowed under the eaves, because they were considered unsightly.</p>
<p>How did this shrewd brain come about? I looked at the narrow room and smiled wryly.</p>
<p>In the evening, the landlord had guests over, and they started playing cards in the upper room. The forceful sounds of slamming cards and apologies indicated the fat landlord's satisfaction today.</p>
<h3>Homecoming (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>As the ship left Hong Kong, I breathed a sigh of relief, as if escaping from a narrow cage. Whenever the ship approached a commercial port from Rangoon, whether it was Penang or Singapore, I always saw brown Mozi standing on the street, directing traffic and yelling at people. Just like in Rangoon and Hong Kong, they wore the same uniforms, wrapped the same large turbans, and carried the same wooden yokes, which inevitably made me feel depressed, as if I was forever rolling in someone else's palm.</p>
<p>Towards dusk, the sea was covered with a thick fog, and the humidity permeated my eyebrows and fingers. The cold wind of the twelfth lunar month, mixed with the bluish-black smoke of coal, swept violently across the deck and the stern in gusts. Just a few days ago, I was on the bright and sunny Indian Ocean, bare-chested, leaning against the railing, leisurely watching the flying fish on the waves, the small islands at the end of the sky, and the sunrise and sunset. Now, it made me shiver and burrow into the crowded cabin. Besides, the sea was full of dull fog, and there was nothing to see. Moreover, many South Chinese people who were about to land in a day or two were covering themselves with blankets, closing their eyes, and dreaming of their homecoming!</p>
<p>The stern was deserted. I remained alone, looking forward with a pleasant and curious smile to the uncharted Pacific Ocean surrounding me, because I had previously gone abroad by land, and now returning felt like a strange traveler drifting into a strange country. At the same time, I was glad that I would likely no longer see the unpleasant things I had encountered in the colonies! Although, the foreign flag hanging at the stern, swaying in the sea breeze, carried a mocking sound.</p>
<p>Cold! Cold!</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone came beside me, warming his hands by breathing on them, saying this. He wore a cheap foreign coat tightly, but a thick Chinese-style collar was visible at his neck, and he wore Chinese-style cotton shoes. Under the brim of his hunter's cap, a pair of eyes that sought to please people sparkled agilely.</p>
<p>When the ship docked in Hong Kong, he, along with his pair of eyes that often sought to please people, appeared in the crowd of passengers, around me. When several people gathered together to talk about Shantou or Guangzhou, he would chime in with, "Ah, what a great place!..." This was how he would join in. If others were talking about dishes like dragon and tiger fighting, bird's nest, or shark fin, he would add comments and liven things up from the side, saying: "Ah, the taste is good, ah." Now, seeing that I was ignoring him, he followed my line of sight as I gazed out at the sea for a while, and then opened his mouth as if trying to strike up a conversation:</p>
<p>"Ah, it looks really nice, ah!"</p>
<p>He nodded slightly as if praising, but the cold wind and cold humidity made his voice tremble and become hoarse. I liked being alone with the sky, the sea, and the fog, just like I enjoyed walking alone in the deep mountains, so I was already unhappy with his appearance at this time. Now, hearing such a meaningless, echoing comment, I was simply a little angry. However, seeing his pair of pleasing eyes looking out from under the brim of his hunter's cap, I had to force myself to make polite conversation and put on a good face. Because other than this small habit of liking to chat with people and echo others' words, he did have some likable qualities. For example, when he was talking to someone and that person took out a cigarette and just put it in their mouth, he would quickly strike a match and eagerly bring it over. When the hawkers of Hong Kong took advantage of the ship's stop to bring newly made foreign coats onto the ship to sell to me, he would put his mouth close to my shoulder and say softly:</p>
<p>"It's worth it even for ten dollars. You can't buy it for fifteen or sixteen yuan in Xiamen, ah!"</p>
<p>At the same time, he would loudly shout at the hawker:</p>
<p>"Subtract a dollar, eight dollars,吧！…He will buy it from you."</p>
<h3>Scenery of Beiping (One-Act Comedy) (1)</h3>

<p>Characters: Liu Qian San, Han Qin Chi, Bu Zheng Yi, Zhang De Juan, Wang the Shopkeeper, Shop Assistant.</p>
<p>Setting: A simple room, poor and messy. Three beds, just planks! As the curtain rises, Liu and Han are still asleep, Bu is sitting on the edge of the bed, putting on worn-out leather shoes.</p>
<p>Bu: Today, I will definitely reach the third step!</p>
<p>Liu: Has the construction phase arrived?</p>
<p>Han: Hmm... (Excitedly) The destruction isn't even over yet, how can you talk about construction!</p>
<p>Bu: Who's talking about national affairs with you! We're talking about love!</p>
<p>Liu: We're talking about Old Gui's advancing steps towards Miss Zhang.</p>
<p>Han: We don't even have food to eat, and you're talking about love.</p>
<p>Bu: Eating and sex are human nature! Whichever aspect has luck, that aspect gets resolved first.</p>
<p>Liu: Once you have a lover, why worry about whether you have food or not!</p>
<p>Bu: That's why I need to hurry and give that set meal to you, so all three of you don't have to go hungry all the time.</p>
<p>Han: "Satiety and warmth lead to lustful pleasure!" You're neither full nor warm, yet you're already thinking about lustful pleasure?</p>
<p>Bu: Is love the same as lustful pleasure?</p>
<p>Liu: Is love considered being satiated and warm?</p>
<p>Bu: Is there nothing besides satiety, warmth, and lustful pleasure?</p>
<p>Han: Then what do you say love is?</p>
<p>Bu: Love is a force! The greatest force!</p>
<p>Han: What kind of force is it?</p>
<p>Bu: It's the force to find food. For example, after I succeed this time, I'll definitely be able to find food for everyone.</p>
<p>Han: If that's really the case, I'll do everything I can to help you!</p>
<p>Liu: I'm also very willing to help you, but I really ate too little for dinner last night, can you get me a sesame cake to eat first?</p>
<p>Bu: I'll definitely think of a way later, but she might come today?</p>
<p>Han and Liu: Come here? Then we can meet her.</p>
<p>Bu: Of course! And I need you to help me!</p>
<p>Han: How can we help you?</p>
<p>Bu: First, we need to get rid of your two beds and arrange the room properly.</p>
<p>Liu: Then it will be like you're living alone!</p>
<p>Bu: (Making a funny face) Second, my Liu! (Patting Liu) Use your cleverness to find some money!</p>
<p>Han: What's the third step?</p>
<p>Bu: Old Liu, keep the shopkeeper here occupied like this, don't let him come discuss things. Old Han, force her in the room: then I will come in freely (pretending to control) and use clever methods to push you out! I, in turn, comfort her crying face into a smile, then gently give her a kiss, tell me how sweet this is</p>
<p>Liu: Let Old Han deal with the shopkeeper! How about I force Miss Zhang to be infatuated with me?</p>
<p>Han: Let me use some clever tricks to get some money!</p>

<p>Telegraphic Special</p>
<p>Voices of the Telegraph World</p>
<h3>A New Interpretation of "Electricity"</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In the past, the telecommunications industry was often criticized by society for having a bureaucratic feel. This bureaucratic feel was nothing more than some heads of telegraph bureaus acting like officials. They were full of official airs, and their official reputations spread everywhere. Moreover, the public believed that telegraph bureaus were government-run, so they also treated the telegraph bureau as an official yamen (government office). Official air, official air, had become a sign of decline. The telegraph industry was full of vigor, and naturally, decline could not be allowed to exist.</p>
<p>Now that the Republic of China has arrived, officialdom has been swept away, and the situation in the telegraph bureau has undergone a complete transformation. The government has established bureaus and stations to facilitate public communication. Although they are official organizations, they are no different from businesses. The head of the telegraph bureau is like the manager of a business, and there is no such thing as an official. The staff and messengers are like the shop assistants and deliverymen of a business, and there is no question of taking oneself seriously because of one's official position. Officialdom, officialdom, has become a sign of decay; the telegraph industry is full of vigor, and decay naturally cannot be allowed to exist.</p>
<p>However, although officialdom has disappeared, being bathed in the new society, it is perhaps inevitable that a kind of foreign air will arise. Influenced by European and American trends, some see themselves as very high and become complacent, especially those who are in large metropolitan areas or major trading ports. Even if this foreign air is not a sign of decay, in the business world, it can often make customers hesitate and feel disgusted.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the current telecommunications industry is not the officialdom of the past, nor the foreign air of foreign influence, but the courage to have a resolution to reform, and the promotion of harmony in line with the New Life Movement. Outwardly, there must be a pleasant demeanor; inwardly, there must be harmony and cooperation. In the old saying, it is "harmony brings prosperity," and in business terms, it is "harmony generates wealth."</p>
<p>If the telecommunications industry handles its business with courage and treats its customers with harmony, then the public will naturally be happy to interact with it. Those who are still dissatisfied with the business can raise questions or request improvements. People in the telecommunications industry will certainly be able to accept and learn sincerely. However, the reporter still hopes that people who use telecommunications should also calm down and think carefully before raising questions or making requests, as this will benefit both parties.</p>
<p>As I was writing, a friend came and said that what I was talking about was "air," and specifically the "air" of the telecommunications industry. What is "air"? It would be better to title it "Electricity." I agreed, and thus named my article "Electricity."</p>
<h3>Improvements to the Methods of Sending and Receiving Chinese Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Ming Jiong</p>
<p>Recently, the transportation authorities have been working hard to improve the telegram service. If it is indeed beneficial to the public, they will not hesitate even if it affects their business. It is now heard that the Telegraph Administration Department has recently implemented the following improvements to the charging methods for Chinese telegrams.</p>
<p>1.  The title of a female recipient is allowed to be included in the address when calculating the number of words for billing.</p>
<p>According to the new regulations of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for provincial telegrams: the titles of recipients, such as committee member, minister, division head, teacher, etc., are allowed to be included in the address when calculating the number of words. However, various titles and set phrases, such as brother, Mr., Mrs., Ms., Jianxun, Jianjian, etc., should be treated as telegram text and charged per word. The telegram bureaus and stations have always used a double-line mark to separate the recipient's name and address from the telegram text. However, for telegrams sent to women, the recipient often only has a surname and no given name. For example, "Wang Tai Tai of Lingyun Villa, West Lake, Hangzhou is critically ill, come quickly." According to the above-mentioned regulations, the two characters "Tai Tai" (Mrs.) should be counted as telegram text for billing, and the double-line mark should be written after the character "Wang." When the recipient receives the telegram, the words listed on the telegram paper would be "Lingyun Villa, West Lake, Hangzhou Wang Tai Tai is critically ill, come quickly." This seems to lose the original meaning of the telegram or easily cause misunderstanding by the recipient. Moreover, in our country's customs, most women over middle age do not have given names, and even if they do, they are often unwilling to make them public. In occasional correspondence, it is necessary to use a title instead of a given name. The Telegraph Administration Department has taken note of this and has made a special change to the regulations, amending the above-mentioned method to state that for telegrams sent to women, if the recipient indeed only has a surname and no given name, the title should be allowed to be included in the address. Although this is a small matter, it greatly facilitates sending telegrams.</p>
<p>2.  Revisions to the Method of Writing Arabic Numerals in Chinese Telegrams</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Transportation formulated the method of writing house numbers and various numbers using Arabic numerals in Chinese telegrams and ordered all telegraph bureaus and stations to follow it, Article 4 of the method stipulated: If the Arabic numerals used in the Chinese clear text telegrams can be proved by the preceding and following context to accurately represent house numbers or amounts of money and goods, and do not have any other hidden meanings, the unit characters such as "hao" (number), "yuan" (dollar), "jiao" (cent), "jin" (catty), "jian" (piece), etc., before and after the numbers, are also allowed. However, senders often misinterpret the articles, oversimplify the telegram text to save money. For example, in the following telegram: "Jiangyin Datong Ship Bureau Yu (200) (215) (1300)", three Arabic numerals are used in succession, with no clear and coherent meaning. Although the sending bureau and station charges according to clear text, the receiving bureau and station believes that the meaning of the telegram is obscure and should be charged as code according to Article 5 of the method, that is, the sending bureau and station should be notified to collect additional telegram fees, but the sender insists that the telegram was originally clear text, which often leads to disputes. Therefore, the Telegraph Administration Department revised the article to stipulate that the unit characters such as "hao" (number), "yuan" (dollar), "jiao" (cent), "jin" (catty), "jian" (piece), etc., must be added after the Arabic numerals used in Chinese clear text telegrams to indicate that they accurately represent house numbers or amounts of money and goods. For example, "588 Shanghai purchased indica rice (750) stone wheat (400) hu." If the sender omits these unit characters, the bureau and station staff should ask him to add them. If they refuse to do so, the entire telegram will be charged as code to comply with the definition of Chinese clear text telegram and to avoid misunderstandings by the receiving bureau and station.</p>
<p>3.  Regulations on the Use of Check Numbers in Clear Text Telegrams from Chinese Banks</p>
<p>Banks and money shops often use a special agreement code number (commonly known as "ya jiao zi") at the beginning or end of the telegram text in clear text remittance telegrams to prevent counterfeiting. This check number is called "Check word" in Western clear text telegrams and is allowed. However, there are no such regulations for Chinese clear text telegrams. The Telegraph Administration Department has now stipulated that Chinese banks or money shops may use a check number at the beginning or end of the telegram text in clear text telegrams, and may use Arabic numerals to represent the date and telegram number. For example, "6892 Shanghai delivered Wan Tai silver one thousand taels Yu Feng foreign currency two thousand yuan 05742.2502." The second-to-last code (0572) at the end of the telegram is the secret code number, and the last code (2502) represents the second telegram sent on the 25th. In the future, banks or money shops can obtain considerable protection when sending clear text remittance telegrams to prevent counterfeiting.</p>
<h3>A Review of Rural Telephones</h3>
<p>— Li Shao Mei</p>
<p>The term "Rural Telephone Service" has rarely been seen in newspapers recently. At a time when people are clamoring to build rural areas, it has disappeared without a trace. Isn't this strange? However, according to the author's personal investigation, it seems that people are now confusing rural telephones with long-distance telephones. In fact, there are many rural telephones being operated in various places; however, they are collectively referred to as long-distance telephones. For example, in the Wuhan area, there is a provincial long-distance telephone management office, and there is also a county government long-distance telephone management office. In the same area, there are two organizations with the same nature, and people suddenly see them and tend to think they can be merged. No, the telephones operated by Wuchang County should be called rural telephones. Places like Jinkou, Qingshan, and Baozixie are all rural towns, but unfortunately people have overlooked this point.</p>
<p>For rural telephones, the equipment and lines can be simpler, which is the fundamental difference between them and long-distance telephones. From an economic point of view, it would be too extravagant to use the good materials of long-distance telephones for rural telephones. Furthermore, rural telephones are not just decorations under the county seat, nor are they just toys for the village elders to broaden their horizons. More importantly, they are a gift for revitalizing the countryside. To clarify their obvious functions, I will explain them below:</p>
<p>1.  Preventing bandits. At present, the situation in rural towns is very unstable, and bandits are rampant. Towns and towns often need to help each other. When necessary, they must also report to the county seat for help. The usual method of gathering the strong men in the village is to sound the gong or fire the cannons; however, these signals are too simple, and the person sending the signal must be very careful, and the strong men who are summoned are also very suspicious. In this tense situation, to deal with it calmly, one relies on the use of telephones.</p>
<p>2.  Protecting dikes. Every year, the state spends a lot of money to build dikes and prevent floods. However, every year, there are countless counties along the river that suffer from breaches in the dikes. The total loss of property is approximately tens of millions. Half of it is due to the weather, and half of it is due to human factors. When guarding the dikes and fighting the flood, the first difficult thing is that there are not enough workers to allocate. If it is possible to divide out the guarding sections and use telephones to exchange information, then the workers will naturally be easily concentrated and will not be exhausted. Furthermore, the farmers inside the dikes will receive accurate information at all times, and at the very least, they should be prepared so that they will not be confused and end up drowning.</p>
<p>3.  Dispatching cars. Now, there are many roads for cars in various towns. The problem of transportation is much more convenient than before. But there is one thing that is most unbearable for pedestrians. That is, when the car is driving in the middle of the road, the machine suddenly breaks down and breaks down. If this kind of thing happens, if there is a telephone nearby, another car can be dispatched immediately to take over. Otherwise, it will waste a lot of people's time and delay a lot of important things.</p>
<p>4.  Cultivating forests. Droughts have been common in recent years, mostly because there are too few forests. In the future, both the central and local governments will inevitably work hard to afforest. However, forests are most afraid of fire. For example, in the United States, every time a forest is carelessly burned, the loss is huge. Therefore, police must be used to guard the forests at all times, and telephones must be installed to facilitate fire fighting.</p>
<p>What has been said above are all theories and principles. However, the author will cite two facts that he has heard to show the effectiveness of rural telephones.</p>
<p>Once, it was a summer night, and the weather was terribly hot. Many people were camping on the banks of the Yangtze River in Wuchang. When the night was quiet, suddenly a shrill cry for help was heard from a small boat in the middle of the river. The people on the shore were all startled, and some even hired boats to go and rescue them. But the small boat was moving as fast as the wind, and the people could not catch up. Many people opened their eyes and felt sad and sighed for this unfortunate person. Among them, there was a clever policeman who quietly went to the county government to use the telephone to notify the nearby towns, instructing them to pay attention to the investigation. At dawn, this suspicious case was solved in Qingshan Town. It turned out that a clerk from a transportation company took hundreds of silver dollars and got off the train at the Ayu Tao Station. Because the weather was very hot, he hired a boat to go to Hankou. Therefore, the boatman first performed a tragic scene of murder and robbery, and then fled far away to Qingshan. Who knew that although he had the ability to flee for his life, he could not match the speed of the telephone!</p>
<p>In Yunmeng County, several farmers suddenly came to the county to report a case. They complained that their plowing cattle had been stolen at night. Plowing cattle are the most important tool in Chinese rural areas. If they cannot be found, it may affect their livelihood. At that time, the people in the yamen (government office) used the telephone to notify the nearby security regiment to assist in the arrest. Sure enough, it was solved in Wuluo Temple Town. The farmers led their lost and recovered plowing cattle and kept praising the mystery of this telephone!</p>
<p>From the above facts, the telephone is indeed one of the tools for building rural areas. The counties that have already established them should try to expand them, so that the lines change from a star shape to a mesh shape. The counties that have not yet established them should hurry up and do so. As for materials, they can buy old materials at a cheap price. For personnel, they can absorb retired members from various telephone bureaus with low salaries to provide skilled manpower. Then, rural telephones will be easy to achieve.</p>
<h3>The Success of Short-Wave Long-Distance Wireless Telephone</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>The experiment of long-distance wireless telephone using short waves between the engineers of the American Wabc radio station and Byrd's Antarctic Expedition has been successful. According to Mr. Kehan, director of the Wabc machine department, on the evening of January 6, Byrd's Antarctic Expedition sent out a wireless telephone using 120 watts of electricity on the ship Jaeob Ruppeit, and New York Wabc received it completely and clearly. At the time of the experiment, the Byrd expedition ship had penetrated into the Antarctic Circle at 72 degrees south latitude and 117 degrees west longitude, about 8,500 miles from New York, and the electricity used for the conversation was only equal to that used by two ordinary lamps. When KJTY (the expedition ship's call sign) was conducting short-wave tests with New York engineers using 1,000 watts of electricity, the transformer suddenly burned out. When it was repaired and retested, it was discovered that the maximum power used in this circuit could not exceed 120 watts. The results of the call were equal to those of other telephones with 1,000 watts of power. It is said that such a small amount of power can make such a long distance clear conversation, which is beyond anyone's expectations.</p>
<h3>The Remote-Control Telephone Cable Used by Wide-Expansion Radio Stations (2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Da Chun</p>
<p>In recent years, this type of high-frequency remote-control telephone cable has been adopted by radio stations in various European countries. There are many examples: the remote-control telephone cables designed and manufactured by the German Siemens factory have been installed in various countries as follows:</p>
<p>1.  In 1926, the radio station in the capital of Austria, Vienna, was the first to use high-frequency telephone cables to connect the music room located in the city center with the broadcasting station in the southwestern suburbs of Vienna. The core line of this cable has a total of ten pairs. Except for six pairs of rural long-distance lines and signal lines, the other four pairs are used for remote-control broadcasting. One pair is dedicated to transmitting music programs, one pair is used for testing, and the remaining two pairs are reserved. These four pairs of remote-control lines are shielded from each other by insulating materials and lead sheets to avoid electrostatic induction from adjacent circuits, so that they are not affected by it. Each circuit is also equipped with a 16-milli-henry (L6 milli-benries) loading coil at a distance of 1,966 meters. Such proper loading allows the frequency in the circuit to reach 10,000 cycles per second.</p>
<p>2.  In 1927, a remote-control telephone cable was also installed between the post office in Konigswusterhausen, Germany, and the broadcasting station in Zeesen. There are three pairs of 1.2 mm (Millimetre) copper core wires in this remote-control cable, which are shielded from each other by metal sleeves, and all circuits are fully loaded. A loading coil is installed every 875 meters, and each coil has an inductance of 16 milli-henries, and its frequency reaches 13,000 seconds per second.</p>
<p>3.  Helsingfors, Finland, has a broadcast studio, and its broadcasting station is located in its nearby suburb, called Labti. It seems very necessary to use high-frequency remote-control cables to transmit music programs between the two places. In the winter of 1927, the German Siemens factory designed and manufactured a remote-control telephone cable for it, which contains three pairs of core wires, which are also metal-shielded and equipped with light loads; the core wires are all 1 mm in diameter copper wires, and the inductance of the load wheel is 13 milli-henries, and one is installed every 1,000 meters, and the total frequency is about 14,000 seconds per second.

<h3>A Record of Visiting the Hong Kong Radio Station (1)</h3>
<p>— Zou Mao Tong</p>
<p>During this visit to Hong Kong, the reporter was introduced by Mr. Pei En, the South China representative of the American United Wireless Radio Company, to visit the Hong Kong Radio Station. The Hong Kong Radio Station is run by the Hong Kong government. After arriving at the station, I met with its business director, engineer, and the Postmaster General, and visited the central sending and receiving room of the Hong Kong station, which took a total of one and a half hours. The general situation of the station is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Equipment of the Central Sending and Receiving Room—The central sending and receiving room is located in the most bustling central area of ​​Hong Kong, close to the post office, with a rectangular glass sign with white characters on a black background hanging at the door. After entering the door, the business director's office and the receiving counter are on the left, and the receiving staff, bookkeepers, distribution foremen, and distribution staff's offices are inside the counter. The telegraph room is on the right. The location of the telegraph room is very small, not even as big as the wireless telegraph room of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. The room is equipped with two punch machines, two automatic receiving machines, five automatic sending machines, more than ten typewriters, and signal amplifiers, V-shaped machines, and other items. All telegrams sent from the Hong Kong station to various places are sent by automatic high-speed machines. For stations with a large number of telegrams, such as between Shanghai and Hong Kong, a dedicated punching machine is set up to punch paper tapes for telegrams sent to Shanghai. The paper tapes are then sent to various machines for transmission. In addition to the machine communicating with Shanghai, each automatic high-speed machine communicates with two or more stations depending on the workload. As for the receiving side, except for the automatic receiving machine used when communicating with Shanghai, the other places still use earphones, but telegrams are copied by typewriters. Based on the above, the sending side of the port does not need to be guarded by a dedicated person. Any machine can be used by a receiving staff to work in dual shifts, which is one of its advantages. There are fewer sending errors, and once an error occurs, it is easy to determine who is responsible, which is the second. The sending machine can communicate with multiple places at the same time, increasing efficiency, which is the third. The method of simultaneous communication is to use one person to specialize in sending telegrams, sitting in the center of a semi-circular table, and assign two or three receiving staff to sit around the semi-circular table. Each person guards and listens to two radio stations, using two earphones to listen to the two radio stations separately, so that one sending machine can communicate with five or six devout reports. However, if this method is implemented, three points must be noted: First, the report must be practiced in advance, and can use earphones to listen to two places separately, and only copy one of them, so that no errors occur. Second, the sound waves of the engine must be stable, and the distance between each station communicating with the sending station must be equal, so that the wavelength used can have little difference. This method can only be applied to radio stations with less incoming and outgoing telegrams, otherwise the telegrams are likely to be delayed. The two automatic receiving machines installed in the telegraph room, in addition to working with Shanghai, the other one is used to self-correct the movement of the automatic high-speed machine. There is also a "V" shaped machine for any sending machine to send a "V" shaped mark when there is no report, which is for convenience.</p>
<p>2.  Separate Sending and Receiving Offices! In addition to the central sending and receiving room, the Hong Kong station also has separate sending and receiving offices near the Kowloon Hotel and the Hong Kong Queen's Hotel. Telegrams are transmitted between each other by telegraph typewriters. (Teleprinter) (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Telecommunications and War</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>In modern warfare, guns, cannons, bombs, airplanes, military maps, and so on occupy important positions, but whether transportation equipment is complete and meticulous is also crucial. Steamships, railways, highways, and telecommunications are the four elements that constitute military transportation. If a country has a million elite soldiers, but lacks flexible and complete transportation equipment and thorough and rapid communication methods to deploy them, then the success or failure of the military is still uncertain. The relationship between steamships, railways, highways, and military affairs is not within the scope of this article and will not be discussed. Let us now talk about the importance of telecommunications in wartime.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of telecommunications in war can be summarized in three aspects: assisting air defense, transmitting intelligence, and commanding troops. These will be explained separately as follows:</p>
<p>I. Assisting Air Defense</p>
<p>During wartime, positions or rear areas are at risk of being attacked by enemy aircraft at any time. Usually, air defense outposts are equipped on the front lines of the battlefield to monitor the movement of enemy aircraft and report what they see to their own side. However, the movement of aircraft is very fast, and the reporting method must naturally be exceptionally rapid. This naturally depends on the transmission of telecommunications. In addition, during wartime, all telegram offices or radio stations, whether private or state-owned, upon seeing enemy aircraft passing through, must immediately report their direction of travel, as well as the number and type, to the relevant parties in order to take precautions. Many countries have established very detailed implementation measures for this matter. As for using radio to communicate with aircraft, it has even more significant effects!</p>
<p>II. Transmitting Intelligence</p>
<p>Once war breaks out, the reconnaissance of enemy situations is extremely important. It is said that knowing yourself and your enemy leads to victory in every battle. In modern warfare, belligerent countries mostly establish intelligence agencies specifically for the reconnaissance of enemy situations. The intelligence obtained, except for ordinary routine matters reported by letter, is reported to the public telecommunications authorities for more important intelligence. Sometimes, a dedicated secret radio station is used. When using public telecommunications authorities to transmit intelligence, it is mostly transmitted in plain language, but the meaning is different, so as to avoid enemy interception.</p>
<p>III. Commanding Military Operations</p>
<p>The greatest authority that telecommunications demonstrates in war is the command of troops. During wartime, the front, rear, left, and right of the battlefield are covered with a communication network composed of telegraphs, telephones, and radio, so as to facilitate the exchange of battle information and the dissemination of orders. The advance and retreat of the overall situation, and the deployment of large armies, are often planned and decided thousands of miles away. Now, there are even inventions that use radio to command aircraft and warships. All of this is the effectiveness of telecommunications.</p>
<p>Since telecommunications are so important in wartime, which type of telecommunication is most suitable for war? This question is as difficult to answer as asking which of the three military arms, sea, land, or air, is the most useful. I believe that the three communication methods of telephone, radio telegraph, and wired telegraph each have their advantages and disadvantages in wartime. The advantage of the telephone is that questions and answers are direct and quick, and commanders and those being commanded can understand the battle situation or decide on advance, retreat, attack, and defense in an instant. However, sometimes enemy spies will often use various methods to steal telephone lines to eavesdrop on messages, and even use the telephone lines to forge orders to command the advance and retreat of troops, causing the enemy army to suffer losses. There are many examples of this in the history of international intelligence. As for radio, it does not require the laying of long lines, occupies a small area, is easy to protect, and the equipment is lightweight and easy to move. These are all things that wired telegraph cannot match. However, radio also has its greatest weakness, which is that the electrical symbols it emits can be eavesdropped on by the enemy. Even if the telegrams are composed of extremely complex codes, enemy armies often employ personnel who specialize in the study of codes, making it easy to decipher them one by one. Isn't this the most dangerous thing? Speaking of wired telegraph, although the length of the line is a disadvantage, as it is often vulnerable to bombing and cutting by enemy aircraft and warships, the confidentiality of communication is more reliable than radio, but mobility is less convenient. Now, in order to ensure safety in wartime, European and American countries have mostly converted overhead wires into underground lines in major cities, so protection is more convenient and stable than before. In short, wired telegraph, radio telegraph, and telephone each have their advantages and disadvantages, and they must be used in conjunction with each other and cannot be abandoned in wartime.</p>
<p>As for how belligerent and neutral countries should manage telecommunications during wartime, this is also a question worth studying. During wartime, belligerent countries mostly put their own telecommunications agencies under military management under the command of national mobilization. Although the public can still enjoy the right to communicate, at that time, this work is no longer the main mission of the telecommunications agencies. At the same time, if the country has telecommunications lines connected to the enemy country, or if there are enemy country transit lines within the country, they should be completely cut off. In addition, belligerent countries establish telecommunications inspection agencies to specialize in inspecting telecommunications. All incoming, outgoing, and transit telegrams and telephones, except for coded telegrams that are prohibited from transmission, are also subject to detention if the plain language telegrams are ambiguous and contain doubts. In the event of military emergencies, telecommunications agencies often only send military telegrams, and all public communications are suspended. There are also considerable restrictions on the languages used in plain language telegrams. For example, during the European War, the United Kingdom permitted the use of English and French, Russia permitted the use of Russian, French, German, and English, and France, due to its border relations with its neighbors, permitted the use of English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, but did not permit mixed use. The use of Chinese characters in telegrams, because they are replaced by numbers, although they are in plain language, is always regarded as a code internationally, which is extremely inconvenient in wartime. As for neutral countries, they may prohibit or restrict belligerent countries from using their own telegrams and telephones if they deem it necessary or beneficial. Furthermore, if the nature of the communication is found to contain assistance to any one of the belligerent countries in their combat behavior, they must fulfill the obligation to prohibit or restrict it.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's telecommunications equipment, from a wartime perspective, it feels even more rudimentary and pitiful. The wired circuits in remote areas are not only old and in disrepair, but radio stations have also not been fully constructed. Although the Ministry of Communications authorities have paid attention to this in recent years, they have been unable to handle it quickly due to the excessive accumulation of military officers' telegram fees and the lack of economic resources. However, in the midst of difficulties and hardships, they are doing their best to gradually build up border telecommunications. From last year to the present, the Ministry of Communications has made considerable achievements in this work. However, from a national defense point of view, our country's existing telecommunications equipment is still far from adequate. Not only should the material aspects be greatly expanded, but also the personnel aspects should be fully trained and reorganized. However, the current situation of each doing its own thing, constructing haphazardly, and having no overall plan is not the way to go. Therefore, the first step must be to start with unifying and strengthening the central telecommunications administrative power. This is a problem that deserves our deep attention!</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A Column (Question from Xu Kangjun of the Capital Police Department)</h3>
<p>We sincerely welcome inquiries about telecommunications knowledge, telegram procedures, and other suggestions to our company.</p>
<p>(Question 1) How to translate and send characters that are not in the New Compiled Telegraph Code?</p>
<p>(Answer) For characters that are not in the New Compiled Telegraph Code, their telegraph code can be translated as a similar character, and then note in the remarks column that a certain radical should be added next to a certain character. For example, the character 枸 in Gouyi County, Shaanxi Province, is not in the New Compiled Telegraph Code and can be translated as the character 旬 (2484) in the telegram, and in the remarks column, it should be noted that a 木 radical should be added to the character 旬. After the telegraph bureau investigates and finds that the sender often uses this character, it will report to the Ministry of Communications to include this character in the New Compiled Telegraph Code.</p>
<p>(Question 2) If there is no telegraph bureau in the sending location or the sending location, but there is a long-distance telephone that can be connected, how should the telegram be written if you want to use the long-distance telephone to send and receive telegrams? How is it charged?</p>
<p>(Answer) Long-distance telephones, if they are run by the Ministry of Communications, or have signed a connection contract with the Ministry of Communications (such as the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau), can send and receive telegrams. Otherwise, because no contract has been signed (such as the Shandong Provincial Long-Distance Telephone), it cannot be handled. This telegram is written according to the post-transfer telegram and charged as an ordinary telegram.</p>
<p>(Question 3) It is proposed to investigate how many streets and alleys there are in cities across the country? Shorten the names of each street to one character, such as a telegraph registration number, plus a house number character, to replace the address of the recipient. I wonder if this kind of saving method can be implemented?</p>
<p>(Answer) This method has been suggested by someone, but after careful consideration, there are many difficulties: 1. There are too many streets and alleys in cities across the country, and it is not easy to investigate and number them one by one; 2. The names of streets and alleys often change. If a numbering method is used, the procedure will be very troublesome; 3. Senders who check street and alley name numbers cannot easily find them without practice; 4. The receiving bureau still has to translate the numbers into street and alley names, and the telegrams will inevitably be delayed. As for the section on saving expenses, since the Ministry of Communications promulgated a method this year that counts the recipient's name and address within 15 characters as 5 characters, the sender can fully detail the recipient's name and address within 15 characters to avoid the Yi that cannot be delivered, and the telegram fee is calculated as 5 characters. This method is very cost-effective for the sender, and there is no reason why the recipient cannot be delivered. Recently, I heard that the Ministry of Communications has ordered all telegraph bureaus to inquire with the postman and send it to the place of receipt. Such thoughtful service has won the favor of the public.</p>
<p>(Question 4) Can Japanese Kana be added to the New Compiled Telegraph Code for our country to send telegrams to Japan for easy translation?</p>
<p>(Answer) For our country to send telegrams to Japan via the Shanghai-Nagasaki submarine cable and the international radio station Cgra (except for the Great Northern Telegraph Company submarine cable), the telegraph code can be arranged in the order of the translation, using seven numbers to form a group, and the fee is still calculated in plain language. This method is very convenient for our overseas Chinese. If it is compiled into Japanese Kana, it is not impossible, but I am afraid it will be inconvenient!</p>
<p>(Question 5) Is it possible to hope for phonetic symbols to be used for telegraphing?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Ministry of Communications has always been very enthusiastic about promoting the national phonetic telegram. The former Ministry of Communications established a Pinyin Telegraph Research Association, which stipulated the national phonetic telegram method and compiled three types of national phonetic telegram compilations, and announced their implementation. After the Nanjing Ministry of Communications was established in the 17th year of the Republic, it sent the A and C types of compilations to telecommunications schools for trial use. Later, the Ministry of Education claimed that the Wang Yin alphabet previously announced was very different from the new standards of the current Zhuyin symbols, not only had the sounds and rhymes changed, but also the symbols had been added and subtracted. The compilation was based on the alphabet paid attention to by the Ministry, and it was necessary to revise it. The Ministry of Communications then appointed Chen Junyi Yu to be responsible for the revision, and sent the revised draft to Beiping to ask the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee to review it in detail in order to achieve perfection. It is heard that the review has been completed, and after the entire draft is corrected, it can be announced and printed, and it is planned to designate several bureaus to try it out first.</p>
<h3>Bi-Monthly News</h3>
<p>— Club Member</p>
<p>Merchants are recruited to manage public telephones. For the convenience of urban residents' communication, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated two types of regulations: the Business Regulations for Ministry-run Telephones and the Business Regulations for Public Telephones Managed by Merchants. Public telephones are opened in all places where the Ministry of Communications telephone bureau is located. In addition to the local post and telecommunications bureaus uniformly installing public telephones for business, merchants are also recruited by the telephone bureau to manage public telephones, divided into agency and contract types. Agents charge according to the call fee rates set by the telephone bureau (3 to 5 cents each time, depending on the situation in each place), and the bureau gives the agent a commission of 5 to 1 cent each time, with a minimum of 2 yuan per month. Contractors pay the telephone bureau a contract fee of 10 to 20 yuan per month, and the amount also depends on the situation in each place. After the opening of these public telephones, the public can talk at any time and anywhere, which is extremely convenient. The aforementioned regulations can be obtained from local telephone bureaus or our company.</p>
<p>Advance sealing and dispatch of postal transfer telegrams. All post offices can collect and send telegrams on behalf of places where no telegraph bureau is located. This telegram is called a postal transfer telegram. The Ministry of Communications now believes that when each telegraph bureau receives postal transfer telegrams from other places, when they are sent to the post office for express mail delivery, they are often not accepted because the post office's office hours have passed, and they are not received and sent until the next day, which is very delayed. Therefore, in order to improve this, the Ministry of Communications has specially ordered all post offices to change their handling methods. Before sealing and dispatching mailbags after external business hours, they should still be received and rushed to catch the shift, so as to speed up and avoid delays.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is actively building long-distance telephones. The Ministry of Communications previously believed that the public in various provinces needed long-distance telephones very much, so it has formulated two plans: the Jiangsu Province Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Network and the Nine Provinces Long-Distance Telephone Network, and is actively carrying out construction. Now that the Sichuan-Lanzhou Highway Construction Committee has supervised the construction and is nearing completion, long-distance telephones between the two places are also very much needed, so personnel have been sent to build them, and they are scheduled to be completed and put into service in February next year. After this, Northwest transportation will be as convenient as the southeastern provinces, and national defense will definitely benefit greatly. In addition, the Fuzhou-Yanping telephone line in Fujian Province has also started construction and will be completed and put into service next month.</p>

<h3>Self-Conceit</h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>When I was a child, I studied in a private school. The teacher taught me to write red copybooks, then write in printed grids, then write outside the grids, and then I actually copied calligraphy. At that time, I was quite conceited, as if my writing was far better than the calligraphy on the copybook. I very happily sent the writing I had done to the teacher to evaluate. Unexpectedly, after the teacher's review, I was greatly shocked, like Cheng Yaojin's axe. I was very disappointed and cursed behind my back, "That plague teacher doesn't know good from bad."</p>
<p>A little older, I studied in another private school. The teacher taught me how to write essays. The teacher set a topic: "Everyone Advances Diligently." I racked my brains, used all my mind, and spent almost three or four hours to write a long essay of two or three hundred words. I read it myself and was very proud. I thought that people like Dong Zhongshu and Han Yu would be afraid that they could not do it. I sent it to the teacher for him to comment on.</p>
<p>What do you think the teacher was like? After the teacher looked through my writing, he hung down his face, stroked his long beard, and sighed, saying: "I find this situation of 'leading a cow down a well' very boring." I knew that my masterpiece was not right, because after I sent my essay to the teacher, I would secretly look at the teacher's face first. Assuming that the teacher's face happily observed my writing, or even began to chant, my writing must be good. Assuming that the teacher's face was unhappy, or even had an angry look, my writing must not be good and I would be greatly scolded. This is a secret trick for students to observe people's expressions, and it is also a kind of experience for being a student.</p>
<p>But I thought that my writing was not bad after all. It was probably that the teacher did not know the goods, or that the things I did did not suit the teacher's taste, and it was also unknown. Later, this essay was commented on by the teacher. I hurriedly looked at his comments, which were either "unworthy of being made" or "weeping on the table." I was extremely angry and wanted to change to a teacher who knew the goods, but the teacher would be changed as long as he was changed, and the scolding would be eaten as long as he was eaten. Looking around, I couldn't find a teacher who knew the goods and praised my writing.</p>
<p>Later, I went to a literary meeting with students from the same town. Needless to say, I was always the last place. If I turned the entire literary meeting book over, I would be the first place. But I was always unconvinced, and I turned around and read the masterpieces of the first, second, and third places, and felt that they were not better than me. So I cursed the graders for being blind and not qualified to grade. I wouldn't go to the next literary meeting. I had a feeling that the whole world was surging and I had not met a confidant.</p>
<p>I was extremely angry, abandoned my books and stopped reading, and went to learn painting. I was also quite conceited in learning painting. I always criticized the current paintings for being wrong, either saying that the charm was not good, or criticizing the brushwork for not being strong. I always criticized him until he was completely destroyed before I felt happy. But what about my paintings? I repeatedly gave them to my friends to see, and my friends always praised them, saying they were good and that there was great progress. Therefore, I was very proudly conceited. But my friends always laughed secretly behind my back.</p>
<h3>Outside the Circle of Life</h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>Snow, drifting wildly, drifting onto the roofs, fields, and branches..., on a cold winter evening.</p>
<p>A five-year-old child, crouched under the eaves of someone else's house, covering her shivering body with a handful of straw: although covered with straw, her teeth were still chattering against each other, and she was only wearing a broken padded jacket and trousers and a small short shirt.</p>
<p>The north wind would absolutely not have sympathy for a child without parents, and still howled wantonly! Like a sharp needle, like a bullet, hitting her weak heart, piercing her whole body, she trembled even more violently!</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, she was still a child with a mother, although her father died a month after she was born.</p>
<p>Five years is such a long time; her mother, who lived in semi-starvation, particularly easily realized this.</p>
<p>After her father died, her mother placed her entire hopes on her. Whenever she thought of her father and was sad, as long as she saw her smiling face, her mother would imagine countless bright futures: wasn't that right? Her daughter was born very beautiful, and it would not be difficult to find a satisfactory and very rich husband in the future. She—her mother's later life—would not need to worry.</p>
<p>A few dilapidated thatched huts, an old bed, rotten benches, a table, and some old clothes that could only cover her body were the inheritance that her father left her at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Five years of life were all obtained by her mother's ten fingers, day and night, day and night, and finally managed to survive until now: although she lived in semi-starvation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of overwork and lack of nutrition that she fell ill? Her mother died of this illness and passed away.</p>
<p>At the time of her mother's death, she was only five years old, no, only four and a half years old!</p>
<p>Could she recall the tragedy of her mother's death? The light of the bean-like kerosene lamp, gloomy, poured into every corner of the sour and smelly room, and also poured onto the face of the dying person: her eyes were deeply sunken, her temples were recessed, and her face was like yellow wax, fully showing the image of a skull. Standing by the bed besides her was an old woman from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The death of a birth mother will not engrave sad scars in the young heart of a four-and-a-half-year-old child: sometimes she will cry "Mama, Mama," but that is only when she cannot find her mother in the quiet night and when her stomach is so hungry that she cannot open her mouth.</p>
<p>It has been half a year since her mother died!</p>
<p>Half a year has flown over the heads of the rich! It has also slowly crawled on the hearts of poor children who are starving.</p>
<p>She begs for food every day. At first, Grandma Shen would give her some leftover cold rice, but later, because she came too many times, she became tired of her and forbade her from entering the door again. She has not eaten for two days now.</p>
<p>The invasion of hunger has made a young child lose her health. The round, full, and beautiful face can no longer be seen; what has been inoculated is only withered yellow and weakness.</p>
<p>The second time was the New Year! On a pile of straw in front of a certain house, a girl was frozen to death. The owner saw it and said angrily, "Unlucky poor ghost! I found me on the sixth day of the year. I don't know what evil I've encountered. It's really bad luck!" He turned to his family and said, "Throw it into the middle creek!"</p>
<h3>East, West, South, North</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>Yesterday, a local supplement in a certain newspaper carried a letter "Goodbye, My Wife." It was a Chen Qiu, whose beloved wife ran away. Because he had no money to post a missing person advertisement, he wrote this letter in a panic. If he waits for news and there is no sound, he will throw himself into the river and commit suicide.</p>
<p>It seems that the same incident happened in the Big Evening News last year. How it turned out later is unknown, but it was probably not very optimistic. Originally, in a society where economics is the principle, being an affectionate couple with an empty stomach is too mythological. Having lost a job, encountered disaster, and being unable to pay the rent or cook white porridge, I ask you, can the past affection be used as food for today?</p>
<p>Many people who get married cannot straighten their backs and complain, and have the intention of returning me to bachelorhood. To Chen Jun, this is the time for you to be reborn. Beloved wives will come in droves in the future. If you keep the green hills, don't worry about having no firewood to burn. Being a human is important, you can't die, turn back quickly!</p>

<h3>Flowers</h3>
<p>Left in the middle, like that, holding a bouquet of flowers so lonely walking alone on the sidewalk, even the disposal of this bouquet of flowers is completely forgotten. It seems like an old man who has been sick for a long time is supporting himself with a cane and strolling in the park, surrounded by the surrounding scenery, seemingly feeling an unprecedented surprise, and also seemingly disgusted as if it were a common sight, and just like that, a weak heart is moving its own body forward, even forgetting its own existence. It has been a long time, and I have been manipulated by that kind of situation.</p>
<p>An unforgettable memory wakes me up from a dream, the faint autumn sun, like a dance girl returning from the dance floor, lies lazily in front of my bed, I remember the person lying on another bed, she may have also woken up from a dream, waiting for a friend to visit her, without fastening a tie, I put on my autumn overcoat, locked the door and came out, as if that pair of big black eyes was seducing me in front of me.</p>
<p>I hurriedly stepped into the flower shop, and from the "Good morning" greeting of the foreign girl, I exchanged for a bouquet of dahlias. I remember it very well, she has a small study, and a vase on the desk always catches that kind of colored flowers, and her pair of big black eyes makes people feel a strange harmony in their hearts. So, with her big eyes embedded in every flower stamen, I forgot to take the tram and walked the long distance alone.</p>
<p>I signed my name on a formal piece of paper, and a girl in white led me to the third floor, where the corridor was as quiet as a convent. The girl in white, like a holy virgin, pushed open the door of the room for me, where the person who was sleeping and waiting for her friend to visit was.</p>
<p>Between the white bed and the white sheets, there was a pair of big black eyes, she was too much like someone waking up from a dream, and a sweet smile remained on the corner of her mouth. I inserted the dahlias into the porcelain vase at the head of her bed, and the dahlias, caressed by the wind blowing in from the window, bowed their heads slightly. "Good morning, master!" it said. The master smiled, waved my hand, and told me to sit by the bed.</p>
<p>"Did you come home?" The big black eyes stared at my chest.</p>
<p>"Didn't fasten a tie?" I said, "But I brought the dahlias."</p>
<p>"Thank you." "In the middle of the night, I woke up, I dreamed of you..."</p>
<p>The white sheets covered the big black eyes, and the hair in the pillowcase was rippled by laughter.</p>
<p>I gently shook her shoulder, "Li," I said, "Stop it, did you dream of me sending dahlias?"</p>
<p>"No!" She raised her head, "I dreamed that you fell into someone else's arms."</p>
<p>"Is there such a thing!"</p>
<p>"It's a dream!"</p>
<p>With a burst of energy, I sat up and bowed my head to kiss the dahlias. "When will I be discharged from the hospital? I'm really scared!"</p>
<p>She smiled like a precious Western painting.</p>
<p>"Rest easy, Li, there won't be such things, I seem to have lost myself, your faithful servant, the dahlia, it can tell you everything."</p>
<p>The pair of big black eyes were buried in the flowers. No words.</p>
<h3>Modern Apprentices</h3>
<p>— Er</p>
<p>Once, I lived on the upper floor of a tailor shop. On the first day I moved in, I saw children of various sizes sewing clothes around a rectangular table downstairs, which particularly disturbed my vision. From then on, a negative shadow was imprinted on my mind. Later, whenever I passed by downstairs, I couldn't help but take a closer look at them.</p>
<p>Those children, I don't know if it was the oppression of life that prevented them from growing up properly, or if they were far younger than ten years old. I seemed to have never seen such short and thin children! And so dark and dirty—their eyes were gray and unclear, with some sores around them, smeared with some red. They looked just like the grotesque little imps in a chaotic dream at night. Sometimes I quietly approached to take a closer look, and found that they didn't even have the strength to move their eyes to look at their hands. Perhaps their eyes were so tired and painful that they could no longer use them to see things, so the small needles kept pricking their hands, and they could only endure it. Who wouldn't sigh inwardly at such children; Heaven knows! Indeed, only Heaven knows what their lives are like!</p>
<p>I often heard crying and shouting from downstairs. I would always anxiously run down and see one of the two children rolling on the ground, clutching their head, crying and shouting loudly. The owner would pull up his sleeves, clench his teeth, and lash out with a rattan cane. It seemed like the children's cries were music to his ears. It was hard to stop until the owner was tired. At night, it was hard to count the number of times I was awakened by the crying of those thin children. I couldn't go down to interfere, so I had to listen silently, listening until my heart was unbearably distressed. Gradually, when I went in and out, I didn't even dare to look at those skeletal children. But sometimes I would still catch a glimpse of them unconsciously. So I finally became uneasy in such a residence.</p>
<p>After moving to a new residence, seeing the children of wealthy families, who were so plump and lively, I thought I had finally gotten some relief. But several times, passing through quieter places, like small iron shops, under the whirring of dark iron machines in the shops, there were also many children sitting, covered in gray and black, living their modern apprenticeship lives. It was equally terrifying! Pitiful! Once, I happened to go to get my leather shoes repaired. The owner promised that I could pick them up early the next morning. When I arrived at the shop early the next morning, there was another child, just as frightening as those in the tailor shop and the small iron shop, desperately working on the leather shoes. If someone missed an appointment, the blame would fall on the apprentice, and the owner would immediately slap the child repeatedly. But the child still kept his head down and continued working. As soon as the first slap stopped, he continued working. The second and third slaps didn't stop him either. But I clearly saw the tears rolling around in the child's eyes, and I couldn't help but admire the child's loveliness! But the more lovely he seemed, the more pitiful he felt. I took my leather shoes and left, and I still heard the owner say that he wouldn't be allowed to have breakfast porridge. Later, whenever I saw reports about apprentices in the newspapers, I would read them carefully. But the suffering often described was the owner beating or killing apprentices. From this, it's easy to know what the modern apprentice's life is like.</p>
<h3>Before Death</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Life is as small as an ant existing in the human world, not even knowing how many days one can survive. However, the disasters and sufferings of life that weigh on my small life's back are far beyond my ability to bear. Thus, my neck is bent down day by day. Hunching over and panting on the long, desolate journey of life, carrying the burden of suffering with weak groans, walking a long, endless road, like a camel walking in the desert, for a long, long time. In those days, in my eyes, I couldn't see a single person, a drop of water, a single green blade of grass. During the day, the sun always hid in the clusters of island clouds, so I couldn't even see the sun. The day simply turned into night. In the night, the shadows of stars and the silver light of the moon never appeared. Only ghostly cold winds were wailing miserably. Besides that, everything seemed to be completely destroyed. The universe truly became an incurable, dark, black hole. Only I, a survivor of life, supporting a broken heart and a broken body, without distinguishing night from day, without light, without happiness, and without joy, silently carrying the heavy burden of suffering, walked the long, endless road.</p>
<p>Sent off into a misty night, followed by an even more desolate rainy night, I also looked back, but I couldn't see anything. Even the footprints I had just passed were already obliterated by the rising dust. Walking, walking, the long road of suffering in life!</p>
<p>Now my strength is almost exhausted, and my legs are completely cramping, so I have fallen by the roadside. Although I can still breathe faintly, I can no longer carry the heavy burden of suffering in life. I knew long ago that life is a cup full of bitter wine that can never be finished, and it is also an endless stage of toil. No matter what, it will never stir up the beautiful ripples of stars. I also know that my life is like a bubble that accidentally floats on the surface of the water, appearing and disappearing on its own, and there is no need to cherish it. Now that I have fallen, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Although this is now the last moment, what am I afraid of? This long road of life has only disasters and no joy. Since I came into the world silently, let me return silently. Don't disturb a single leaf or a sleeping little bird. Like a cloud in the sky, flying and spinning aimlessly over people's heads, then quickly flying away. People didn't notice, and it didn't have any connection with the ground. I wish I could stop breathing quietly at this moment, right here, and lie here forever, and the soil and dust will cover me and form a home. Perhaps after a while, a wild grass will accidentally grow, and that would be the most precious ornament. Any epitaph is useless to me; I don't wish for it. Let my life, the life of suffering, be taken back and hidden underground with me. There is no need for anyone to proclaim it. Perhaps the stars will accompany me in the future, or perhaps the flowing clouds, for there is the twinkle of stars even in the shooting stars!</p>

<h3>Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>When I step into that simple little teahouse every morning, several strangely familiar faces wave before me again. —Oh! Mr. Wu, you're so early! Are you coming to the street again?</p>
<p>They all have this greeting of inquiry hanging on the corners of their mouths; but I don't know if they are complimenting me? Or being perfunctory? Perhaps it's perfunctory! As for complimenting, I dare not accept it, and I don't have anything worth complimenting them about in the first place.</p>
<p>—Good—you're all early!</p>
<p>I nodded to them casually.</p>
<p>Since I came here, I always come here every morning to sit for two hours, I have to kill a lonely morning. Although I don't like to drink tea, when I get here, it seems like I have to drink it, so I finally pour that pot after pot of thick, blood-like black tea into my stomach, cup after cup. By the time I go back to eat, that pot of thick, blood-like black tea has become as thin as plain boiled water, and the old tea leaves, one by one, lie straight at the bottom of the pot like dead fish.</p>
<p>Coming here to sit for two hours is quite worth it. Twelve copper coins for a pot of tea, plus six copper coins for a set of fried dough sticks, for a total of only eighteen copper coins, but a whole morning is spent.</p>
<p>If it's a rainy day, it's even better there. The teahouse is full of customers all day long because many farmers can't go to the fields or work in the mountains because of the rain. So, tired from the sunny days, they wait for this rainy day to rest. Mahjong, digging flowers, jokes, and food all blend together.</p>
<p>I have been here for more than twenty days, and I have gone to that little teahouse almost every day, but there is one thing that I hate the most, the scabby-headed waiter. His throat is like a broken bamboo, and he shouts loudly; his clothes are so dirty that it makes people nauseous, and the smell of garlic penetrates directly into my nostrils. But he insists on trying to strike up a conversation with me, completely oblivious to my feelings.</p>
<p>—Mr. Wu—Shanghai is truly a paradise, you are so lucky to eat in Shanghai...</p>
<p>—Oh...</p>
<p>He just keeps talking, but I don't answer. I just cover my mouth and nose with a handkerchief, but I almost throw up.</p>
<p>But listening to the high-level discussions of several gentlemen is quite interesting.</p>
<p>What they talk about is not international news or political news, but the current situation in the countryside naturally flows from their mouths. Sometimes, they also talk about romantic things.</p>
<p>And there are many rural social news that they have gathered from their field visits, so it is more reliable than what is published in the newspapers.</p>
