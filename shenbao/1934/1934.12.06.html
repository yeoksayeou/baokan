<h3 id="c32">德國外交之轉向　恒 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>就最近外電觀察。德國外交已有顯著之轉向。如希特勒一方派遣特使里寶特羅浦訪問法國。以謀英法德之諒解。他方復與法成立薩爾煤礦將來用價贖回之恊定。此二事件之最後成效如何。雖尙難知。然其足以和緩今日德國與法英之關係。幷鬆弛歐少一時緊張之局面。則要無疑問。唯向以對外强硬爲國策之德當局。何以有若是之轉變。實值得我人之注意也。</p>
<p>據昨日歐電。謂德國時局。仍頗杌隉。國防軍與衝鋒隊黑衫隊。宿隙未消。宗敎糾紛。亦有復作之虞。加之。一週以前。外電竟有國防軍醖釀政變之言。其後雖無所聞。然人心之不寗。於此可見一斑矣。故今次德國外交之轉向。决非無因以我人觀察。似爲内部困難所促成也。</p>
<p>德國自六卅事件以來。表面雖已安靜無事。而國社黨内之左傾分子依然存在。此輩之希望。原在實現民族的社會主義。然自希希氏登台以至受任爲唯一元首以來。所謂民族社會主義。固未嘗稍有實現。一般黨内之左傾分子。不能不大爲失望也。再者。自希氏政權確立而後。德國其他政黨。皆遭排斥。然　最近英美報章所載。共黨之秘密活動。又在進行。即希氏之衝鋒隊中。亦潛伏反動勢力不少。據希黨要人凱伯勒氏稱。設衝鋒隊一旦解散。則共産之禍。可以立見。而熟悉德國情形者。亦多謂今日德國人民所以不顯一致反對希氏者。亦爲共禍之一念所懾耳。此爲德國今日最大之内患。而消弭之道。亦有待於國際關係之改善也。</p>
<p>希特勒前曾謂。各國若再對德作經濟上之封鎖。而不售以原料者。則德國儘可自製代用品。以爲抵制。然一般代用品之製造。究去事實尙遠。其比較成功者。一爲煤油。二爲棉料。然煤油得自石炭者。其價甚昻。棉料製自木材。質劣易壞。價格亦較棉花爲貴。且僅能與毛棉等自然品羼雜應用。難完全代替毛棉。至其生産量不足國内棉品需要百分之一。猶其餘事。德人無論如何努力。終難應付目前之急。此其又一明證也。</p>
<p>今年入冬以來。德國人民以國内食料之缺乏。競相預藏。以故物價騰貴。異於平時。而最近德政府所頒之所得稅法。復稅及每年收入在五百六十馬克之貧民觀。此數端。德國困窘之狀。已至［捉襟見肘］之境地。再不改善國際關係。進謀國際貿易之開展。則二次革命之爆發。實亦不易避免也。</p>
<p>由是觀之。德國今次之外交轉向。當以内部困難爲其主要原因。唯其在功之關鍵。則在於軍備平等問題。與東歐公約問題。而此等問題之能否解决。又視法德間能否捐棄前嫌以爲斷也。</p>

<p>暢談丹麥農業合作</p>
<p>行政院參議兼農村復興委員會專門委員朱樸、於本年夏間、奉命赴歐美各國、考察農業合作事宜、於昨日（五日）乘加拿大皇后號返抵上海、新聲社記者、晤之於輪次、詢其此行結果、承答如下、</p>
<h3 id="c143">考察經十餘國 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>朱氏謂、本人於本年六月初出國、迄今適爲半年、此半年之内、曾在意大利·瑞士·法蘭西·比利時·英格蘭·荷蘭德意志·丹麥·瑞典·加拿大·美利堅·等十餘國考察、計以在丹麥之時間爲最多、幾逹三月、因丹麥有合作國家之稱、其農業合作、尤爲發達、是以當本人出國之時、卽專以丹麥爲目標、考察結果、至爲滿意、尙有印度·及日本·兩國、其農業合作、亦有相當成績、惜以怱怱經過、未獲稍事參觀、頗以爲憾、關於丹麥農業合作狀况、非短時間内所可盡述、茲姑爲略談其大槪、藉告國人、</p>
<h3 id="c144">丹麥農業合作 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>丹麥爲一小國、其而積不過一萬六千五百七十六方哩、尙不及我國最小省份浙江之半、其人口不過三百五十五萬零六百五十六人、尙不及我國最少省份甘肅之半、但其農産之富足、社會之安定、人民之快樂、則爲世界上任何國所不及、考其所以致此之由實全賴合作運動之功、丹麥人民、十九爲合作守之社員、合作運動、在丹麥之歷史、並非甚遠、七十年以前、丹麥之狀况、固與今日之我國無殊、其時丹麥適值一八六四年對普奥戰爭失敗之後、復遭極嚴重之天災、因之産業之衰落、及經濟的恐慌、逹於極點、丹麥人民、目覩危象、力謀自救、遂追隨英國之後、提倡合作運動、迄今蓋不過數十年而已、</p>
<h3 id="c145">分配的社會化 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>丹麥今日之最足以傲人的現象、卽爲總理孫先生所云之［分配的社會化、一全國人民、旣無所謂巨富者、又甚鮮亦貧者、人人皆豐衣足食、其樂融融、此蓋已實現合作主義之理想、同時亦足以顯示此種現象、决非資本主義之國家或共産主義之國家所能企及　也、丹麥之農業産品、以醃肉、鷄蛋·牛油　三項爲大宗、其銷路最廣者、爲英德兩國、若醃肉銷英國　、逹百分之九十九、本國所自用者、不過百分之一、鷄蛋銷英國者、逹百分之八十五、銷德國者、百分之十四、本國所自用者、亦不過百分之一、牛油銷英國者百分之六十八、銷德國者百分之二十五、　國所自用者、不過百分之七、諸如此類、不勝枚舉、近年以來、因世界各國經濟狀况之普遍衰頽、英國對丹麥之進口貨物、乃有所謂、定額制度］之限制、德國則以經濟財政、瀕於破産、無力足以購買外貨、因之丹麥頗受相當影響、</p>
<h3 id="c146">絕無不景氣象 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>但據本人在丹麥各處鄉村所觀察、則其欣欣向榮之象、固仍在在足以令人羨慕、絕不如其他各國之一望而卽可見其不景氣之充分表現也、良以丹麥農村之經濟基礎、已極鞏固、一時略受外國之影響、殊不足以挫其毫末耳、本人於觀察丹麥之後、乃益覺農業合作之在我國、應多事提倡、目前朝野各方對此、固已有相當之注意及提倡、然尙望舉國人士之一致奮起、共奉以爲復興農村之不二法門、則我國農業及民生前途、實利賴之云云、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>今年脂粉香水進口，打破了從前的紀錄，大家都說婦女國貨年成績如此，極譏嘲的能事，這種見解大錯特錯。試問今年不是婦女國貨年，難道這二百餘萬的脂粉香水花邊首飾，便不致進口麽？不來提倡國貨，洋貨倒可以不致這樣猖獗麽？吾敢大膽的說；幸而今年是婦女國貨年，還有一輩獃子在那裏奔走呼號瘏音焦舌的促省一般不知愛國的婦女，來服用國貨。否則在此人欲横流奢侈無度的時代，恐怕脂粉香水的進口量，還不止此數咧。總而言之，人家譏嘲，無非感憤所致，也不是含有惡意，祗要我們婦女界，今後大家爭氣，什麽巴黎粉，什麽法國胭脂，一槪不要用他。面上搓的，身上灑的，都是國貨的脂粉香水，那麽纔對得起婦女國貨年。如果甘心崇尙外貨，貽人恥笑，那麽，社會的制裁力極大，恐怕以後面上樣了外國脂粉，身上灑了外國香水，有心人見了，一定掩鼻而過，斥爲無恥之尤，還出什麽風頭呢？</p>

<h3 id="c205">國貨運動的新展望 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 愼思</p>
<p>明年定爲學生國貨年</p>
<p>國貨年　已經過去，［婦女國貨年］也行將終了，最近兩年來努力提倡國貨的結果，雖是收效極微薄，尤其是本年中間甚麽口香糖，脂粉，香水，玩具等等的入超數，增加得出於我人意料之外。可是我們能因此而灰心嗎？不，决不，唯有加緊的努力，纔能使國貨運動發揚光大，一切阻礙和困難，無論任何［開先路］的工作中，都不免要遭逢的，［其作始也簡，其將畢也鉅］，目下的收穫雖不多，成功也許就在不遠的將來，我相信。</p>
<p>明年已擬定爲學生國貨年了，對於這一個命名，我覺得有無窮的感想。</p>
<p>外貨的傾銷雖是無孔不入，窮鄉僻壞，都有牠的足跡，但在比較上，都市的消費量當然比鄉村來得多，而口香糖，脂粉·香水，玩具之類的貨品，更和農村無緣。國貨的忠實服用者，大部分還是勞苦的農民。外貨的推銷者，有一部分却是受敎育的學生們，從文具到衣飾，在學校中外貨往往奪國貨之席，這種現象很普遍，無席諱言，多麽使人痛心！</p>
<p>所以這幾年來，中央政府和敎育當局，曾三令五申，限令學校購買用品和學生服裝，必須採用國貨。地方政府如廣東省，也曾有學生用文具要儘量採用毛筆和國産紙張，不准濫用鋼筆和洋紙的規定。可是禁令雖嚴，實際上還不是［陽奉陰違］，視同具文嗎？</p>
<p>本來提倡國貨，不是任何功令所能勉强辦到的，必須改變一般人的心理，養成一種愛用國貨的習慣，逐漸推行，務使成爲一時風尙，這樣纔能有實際效果。學校是敎育國民的塲所，學生是有希望的靑年，是未來的國家主人翁，對於提倡國貨，挽救危亡，應當有［身體力行］的勇氣，也是義不容辭的舉動。</p>
<p>［旣往不諌］，過去的錯誤，不必說，不也忍說了。［來者可追］，我們惟有希望在明年的學生國貨年中，全國的大，中，小學裏男同學和女同學們，都有一種自我的覺醒，除［身體力行］之外，還負起對家庭，對社會盡力鼓吹，督促的責任，學生是知識階級，容易博得一般人的同情和信仰，一定能使國貨運動日進於光明之路，［學生國貨年］的意義比了［國貨年］和［婦女國貨年］更來得深長，原因便在此。要是有名無實，那便未免辜負這［學生國貨年］五個字了。</p>
<p>同時還希望學校當局在置辦用品時，　量的切實，採用國貨。而國貨工廠也應當儘最的製造各種敎育用品，以供給需要。這樣纔能使學生們留下一個深刻的印象。實在現時敎育用品中有許多東西沒有國貨可以替代，這不能不算是一大缺憾。要彌補這個缺憾，正有待於各方的努力，在明年中間造出一個新局面·爲國貨運動放一異彩。</p>

<p>讀申報。藉悉吳市長發起參加菲島嘉年華會。鄙人嘗執筆政於馬尼拉新福建報。對於嘉年華會之影像。尙能略記一二。且對於海外國貨宣傳。有幾點須供獻者。爰特筆之於書。以供參加者之考證焉。</p>
<p>每年二月一日。菲政府開嘉年華會Ｃａｒｎｉｖａｌ於馬尼拉。Ｍａｎｉｌａ，Ｐ·Ｉ·期前中西各報。附印選舉票。截下卽可爲選舉嘉年華會皇后之用。選舉票寄由各報。每日綜計其數。露布於報中。選舉之熱度。幾達寒暑表百度以上。非我國選舉者所能望其項背。</p>
<p>開會之前數日。各報將皇后之得票最多數者。函逹該會事務所。再行複選。皇后選出後。卽於開會前一日。開歡迎皇后大會。無論何國人。凡顧與會者。可先期至事務所報名。是日早晨。喬裝之歡迎者。集於會塲。列隊而赴皇后之住宅迎接。皇后坐三四丈高之檯閣上。繞道而至會塲。沿途觀者如堵。且爭以各色紙條擲送之。紙條舒展時。五光十色。倍覺美觀。</p>

<p>會塲中之設備　陳列各種物品。如博覽會然。</p>
<p>菲島華僑商業。夙稱發逹。此次吳市長召集各界領袖討論向菲島宣傳國貨。鄙人有數點須供獻者。</p>

<p>㈡食的方面。應選國産罐頭食品糖果餅乾陳皮梅。如冠生園泰康泰豐等之出品。</p>
<p>㈢住的方面。應選國製之床　檯椅鏡瓶被褥。</p>

<p>㈤體育方面。應選國製之運動器械。如中國標準公司之出品。</p>
<p>㈥娛樂方面。應選國製之影片樂器。如明星聯華影片公司等之出品。</p>
<p>運往之物件。以各種完備爲美。將來閉會後。此種物件。卽可在該處商會内設一國貨陳列所。以垂永久而資紀念。每種物品。可在菲島分銷處。以便僑胞之選購。如是辦法。非一時之宣傳。乃永久之宣傳。質之熱心中南貿易諸公。以爲何如。</p>

<h3 id="c207">國産絲絨之新興 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 華進</p>
<p>絲織品本來可分三大類，一是綢，二是緞，三是絲絨，各國都是這樣分的；海關上對於絲織品的分類，也是這樣。中國的絲織品，這三種東西，本來也都出産，但是［絨］，只有一種樟絨。辛亥革命以後，這樟絨内爲洋貨的絲絨，花色繁多。而且色彩鮮艷，所以樟絨日漸退化幾乎沒有人再穿用，並且也絕少製織。退化的原因呢，完全是很少變化，墨守成法，所以服用者日久生厭，無人顧問；而製造者呢，在技術方面，設備方面，也不能設法精進，仿製洋貨絲絨。所以舶來絲絨，暢銷於中國，而無法挽回利權。舶來品絲絨價格，有貴到十幾元一尺才買得到，至少也要一元左右一尺，漏巵之大，無出其右。</p>
<p>國産綢廠年來所出綢緞，五花八門，也很改良，卽如高貴的　其紗，在六七年前，美亞織綢廠也早已能製織，而絲絨則直到今年才有出品。今年綢緞市塲上，有好幾種國産絲絨，已風行一時，如玉簾絨，美化絨，馬利絨等，不能不歸功於美亞廠等苦心研究。絲絨的製織，在歐美是兩疋同時織造，貼連在一起，而在機械上自動的用刀劃開；但是這種機械，價值極貴，中國還沒有，所以用别種方法製造。而製造出來的品質與形式，不但與舶來品沒有什麽兩樣，而且花紊色彩，更其時新，適合國人的嗜好。</p>
<p>技術是本來沒有止境，只要有人肯研究，肯用苦功，自然有收獲，現在的國産絲絨，總算業已成功，國人排用的也很多很多，同時舶來品絲絨，當然要减少銷要不少。因爲國産絲絨的賣價，只合到舶來品絲絨的賣價，十分之三四，品質又相同，國人又何樂而不買國貨呢？所以我以爲要推銷國貨，應該由製造者先自改良品質，减低售價，才可以逹到目的。吾則一定要勉强人買品劣而價貴的國貨，確非　實所許可的呢。</p>

<p>㈠小販攤販禁止售賣洋貨</p>
<p>㈡理髮店化裝品須用國貨</p>
<p>㈢國展會已閉幕成績極佳</p>
<p>南京市長石蘅靑氏·對於提倡國貨一事，很能脚踏實地的去做，所以南京市提倡國貨的成績，很是不錯。而石市長所發起的南京中國國貨公司，自從雙十節開幕以後，營業也很發逹，可見京中人士對於提倡國貨，已有相當的認識，所以服用國貨的空氣，也就很濃厚的了！</p>
<p>最近，石市長以爲不但商店應該提倡國貨，就是小販攤販們，也都應該提倡國貨，恰巧京市社會局正在辦理輪船碼頭小販的登記；京市工務局也在辦理夫子廟内市塲攤販的登記；而且京市衛生事務所又在辦理取締食品小販的登記，所以石市長特地訓令社會局，和衛生事務所，對於這些登記的小販和攤販，都要售賣國貨，由各該局發給許可證，纔准營業。如果要是賣的洋貨，那就立時取銷他的登記，禁止他的營業，這在表面上看起來，似乎是沒有注意的價值。但是我們如果詳細考察一下，差不多的東洋貨，都是由這般小販攤販經售。現在石市長不准小販攤販售賣洋貨，那挽回的漏巵的確是不少。其次，首都新生活運動促進會最近因爲每年進口的外貨化妝品，爲數很鉅。爲了挽回這種漏巵起見，特會同社會局曉諭全市各理髮店，以後所用的香水，花露水，雪花膏，生髮油之類的化妝品，一律須採用國貨，不得私自購用洋貨，一面並製就不少提倡國貨的標語，懸掛在理髮店内，使理髮的人注意。</p>
<p>京滬各地一百六十幾家國貨塲商所組織的首都國貨展覽會，自從上月二十日在四象橋大世界遊藝塲露天花園内開幕以後，已經有一個月，所以該會已於日前閉幕，剩餘貨品，一部份運回總廠，一部份則轉往蕪湖參加展覽，據該會主持人的表示，此次展覽的成績極佳，一個月來，所收入的貨欵，竟逹二十萬以上，在這市面凋蔽的現在，實在是很不容易啊！</p>

<p>美國職業棒球錦標隊、棒球大王貝貝羅斯等十五人、昨晨九時、搭昌興輪船公司坎拿大皇后號抵此、一時歡迎者如狂、即於下午二時半、應本埠美僑業餘棒球會之邀請、在申園與本埠業餘麥令及日僑混合隊、作表演比賽門票雖售二元三元及五元、但中外人士慕名往觀者、仍有千餘Ｉ棒球大王貝貝羅斯及其夫人女公子合影</p>
<p>人、惟朔風怒吹氣候驟冷、球員不能施展手段、表演未曾驚人、觀衆亦無不呌苦連天、滬隊雖集精銳組成、實無競爭可言、美隊隨意嬉弄、以念二比一勝、滬隊之得一分、亦由於美隊之奉送而已、該隊已昨晚七時、乘原輪離滬赴菲、</p>

<p>雙方隊員於下午二時許到塲、中外人士有特購新棒球懇美國隊各球員簽名留作紀念者、大有應接不暇之勢、棒球大王貝貝羅斯、體格魁偉、貌雖可怕、但談叶言行、殊爲滑稽、號稱貝貝羅斯第二之新本壘打大王福克斯、因脚踝受傷、未能出塲、</p>
<p>開賽之前、先作佈陣及打擊之活動、美國隊擊出之球、如有飛過鉛絲網、落入看台中者、均爲觀衆刦去、認爲名貴紀念品、一時被搶去者共有十餘個、實因防地太小、不適於棒球比賽、如一用力、必出塲外、更以美國隊各選手之絕技、不足以展其所長、故比賽時亦隨隨便便、精彩殊少、然上海隊悉心攻守、猶有不能下塲之勢、</p>
<p>美國隊先一度作徒手之守壘表演、各人作空手投接之狀、狀况滑稽、博得掌聲不少、二時半比賽開始共賽九局、至四時半完畢、結果美國隊以二十二比一勝、上海隊一任美選手之嬉　耳、</p>
<p>滬隊投手共換三人、先爲麥令斯之馬列斯、此人臂力甚佳，功夫亦深、前三局美選手一籌莫展、且每遭三振下塲、第四局上始失去二分、第五局上、錯誤百出、高球低球、屢次失手、於是局勢　亂、不可收拾美國連得十一分之多、後因自己送死、才致下塲、是局後調阿門屈洛任投手、平平無奇、第八局上又調列朋、此人爲業餘隊投手、爲上海第一名投手、但因久疏練習、球多野投、競爭愈爲沉悶、美國選手徒然敷衍了事而已、各局比數如下、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>胡嫂子先是紅了臉，後就轉了笑容，因道：那個怪你，我不過是說，大姑娘當面，你說這話，難爲情罷了。說着，就伸手把月英拉了進來，笑道：進來罷，那樣進不進。出不出的樣子，更是惹着别人家留意。月英被他拉進來以後，隨身就在墻角落裏，一張方凳上坐下。這裏有一張兩屜小桌上面亂放着紙烟火柴茶碗破紙捲筆墨之類，而另外還粗兩件東西。是讓窮人看不得的便是這裏有一個大鍋塊。和一碟子韭菜炒肉絲。而且那碟子上，擱了一雙筷子，彷彿是預備着人來吃一樣。胡嫂子聞到那香味，早是吞下了口痰去，撅了一小塊鍋塊，好像鬧着玩似的，放到嘴裏去咀嚼着。小紀並不理會，因道：他臉上擦的是什麽粉。將嘴向月英臉上一努。胡嫂子道：我們家那有㬷脂粉，這是剩的一點牙粉讓他抺上了。小紀道：胡嫂子，這是新烙得的鍋塊，好吃不好吃？胡嫂子又撅了一小塊下來，笑道：好哇！你送我吃嗎！小紀道：這算什麽？我請你二位都成。不過有一層，你也得依我一件事。我們這裏有女客，我去借些㬷脂粉來，你和這姑娘，打扮下下。說不定我還可以借一件衣服……月英低了頭就搶着道：我不！小紀並不看了他，却看了胡嫂子。胡嫂子道：就是這麽一方鍋塊，你把它看得那樣重。小紀道：不忙呀，我旣然請你二位，當然讓你二位吃飽。我還有呢。說着，他在他的舖底下，小籃子裏，取出了一方鍋塊，又是一隻開了的罐頭，裏面還有一半鹹的榨菜。笑道：那桌上壺裏有熱茶，你們自己斟着喝罷，我去借東西去了。說着，一溜烟的走了。（八二）</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>街頭藝術家，並不是學校出身的，自然更說不上上巴黎的甚麽學院去研究。他們根本不知道甚麽呌做爲藝術而藝術，自然更談不上甚麽呌做文化。但是他們却有一手造像的好本領。</p>
<h3 id="c242">點滴 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— （阿鴛）</p>
<p>蘇滬一帶有句［吹牛皮］的俗語，皮是□字的代表，雖稍雅致，而實欠通。我以爲此後做起文章來，要引用這句話，可改寫作［鼠牛比］，較爲幽默而脫俗。因蘇滬人請吹鼠兩字，聲音相彷；且以鼠之小，欲比牛之大，仍不失原有之自誇的意義哪。</p>
<p>街頭藝衛家造像，不用石膏，而且也不用刀挫。街頭藝術家所有的，是一團一團五顔六色的熟麵粉。他們的工具，是一根竹片，一段不上十齒的斷的小木梳，以及一團漬透着菜油的舊棉絮而已。</p>
<p>街頭藝術家的十個笨拙而粗糙的手指，却能造出細緻的人像來。他們都能用抹着油的手指，借着一根竹片之力，把五顔六色的熟麵粉，揑塑出一個一個不同的形象來。觀音菩薩，濟顚和尙，印度阿三，外國女人，以及蚌殻精，湖絲阿姐之類，都能揑塑得維妙維肖，栩栩如生。</p>
<p>街頭藝術家，是江湖上的流浪者，但是他們却也是靠了技巧而生活者。濟顚和尙，賣十個子兒，蚌殻精賣十六個子兒，雖然他們的作品，沒有人給帶到芝博或是沙龍去宣傳，展覽，但是街頭藝術家們，却正合了爲生活而藝術的那一句話。</p>
<p>自然，濟顚和尙，觀音菩薩之類，是太幼稚而鄙陋了，够不上大藝術家替歷史上的偉人所造的像那麽吃香，但是我以爲這才是我國平民階級的文化的忠實的表現。</p>

<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>近年來上海一般的地産商，覺得從前所造的房子，什麽坊什麽里的名目，有些呆板，惹不起人們的注意，於是許多新造的屋宇，多已改呌什麽村或别墅，期望改變人們的觀念，其實還是換湯不換藥。</p>
<p>里坊的弄堂房子千篇一律，實在令人有些討厭了，空氣不好，光線不好，屋宇的搆造，簡陋呆板，近來雖有些略爲新式，但租金每月須一二百元以上，最少也要七八千元，要是你不怕租金的高昂，也肯屈居在空氣穢濁的環境中，但是他的組織，他的精神，是異常散漫，可以說絕無組織之可言，除非反對房東加租的時候。</p>
<p>新村便不同了，他是健全的具體的一個集團，他的屋宇格式和道路，花圃，警衛，水電，消防，淸潔，和小學，會堂等等，無一不是經過專家的精密設計，因地制宜的設施，務使住在村裏的人家，都得着很舒適的生活，這一種生活，决不是伏處在都市在的雜亂無章的弄堂房子裏所能夢想得到。</p>
<p>現在好了，上海有薔薇園新村出現了，我們常常咒詛住在舊式里坊中的弄堂房子的房客，要是决心夫嘗試那眞正新村生活的，不如快些加入薔薇園新村一同合作罷。他們是採取合作社的性質，來辦理新村事業，村中的一切，都是根據合作的原理和精神去幹。守望相助，疾病相扶持，互敬互助，確是新生活運動中的一支别動隊，决不是如越人視秦人的肥瘠，漠不相關，各顧各事的舊式弄堂房子的陋習，所可同日而語。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不錯，畫像並不曾如此詳細的告訴我們：告訴我們的是一具大玻璃匣子，這具玻璃匣子恰好就安在畫像的下面，裏頭所盛着的東西便是畫中人的每一件服飾：他的蒙古式的馬鞍，他的精緻的獵裝，他的純金製的脚蹬，一切無不齊備。所缺的就是活的人和活的馬。依我所推測，那幅畫像的作者必然是根據了這些現實的東西，先畫成一個殻子，然後再追憶了這些東西的主人的形容身份，用心添加起來，才拼凑就這幅動人的畫像。</p>
<p>畫上還有三件東西，上面還不曾說過。第一件是乾隆左手上掛着的一支皮鞭；第二件是他套在左手的一張弓；第三件是一個箭壺，裏面揷着好幾支箭。這三件東西也同在那口大玻璃匣子裏陳列着，我們因此也得細細賞鑒。那皮鞭大約有三尺長，一端是用幾條皮帶像編髮辮似的編就的，卽用以驅策馬匹；别一端是一個白玉的柄，這柄上鑽着兩個對穿的小洞，另外繫着一根絲縧，人的手便套在這根絲縧裏，如此就可隨意揮舞了。再瞧那箭和弓，一般都用白玉鑲嵌着，我看了不覺有些懷疑，白玉做的箭頭，難道眞可以用來射獵嗎？也許這些箭祇是一種裝飾物，到實用時就用鐵的箭頭來代替了。（一九二）</p>

<h3 id="c285">關於現實主義文學 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 殘月</p>
<p>最近看到企君在本談上發表的那篇［現實的浪漫的］文章，對於現實主義和創造的想像力或幻想的關係，闡明得頗爲精細，很足以助人更深切的去接觸和理解到現實主義文學機構的廣大性。關於現實主義雖則經人談過不少，但普通都以爲現實主義是依然停留在客觀主義上面的，這種純客歡主義的詮釋，是把自由的廣大的現實主義拖進了淺涸的泥湫裏。在這裏，我想把現實主義文字的幾個特質叙述一下，或者更可以明白現實主義與浪漫主義和寫實主義的關係和異同。</p>
<p>浪漫主義的作家是純然主觀的地去描寫個人的私生活，或者發揮個人的奇思幻想的：寫實主義的作家是純然客觀的地用旁觀態度去描寫現實的；浪漫主義的不切合現實的幻想，自然是把自己的社會的實踐離開，而寫實主義的純客觀的描寫，也是把社會的實踐和自己離開，因此浪漫主義和寫實主義都有偏頗的存在，但現實主義的文學，便不這樣，它不是或此或彼的單純的重視，而是把現實生活和個人的理想統一起來，活躍起來。現實的觀察，不是純客觀所能奏效的，個人的幻想或者浪漫的成分，］也應該要從現實中滲透出來，所以，現實主義所描寫的［人］性，是社會的典型，是活潑的具有客觀條件的個性，所描寫的社會現象，是能動的部分，而不是靜止的死扳的事物。</p>
<p>現實主義並不拒絕理想的成分，正需要有活潑的理想，來照耀現實的歷史的動向，因之心理的描寫，是更加迫切地的需要。但關於人物個性的心理描寫，應當作爲在環境發展中的某一種典型心理去描寫，而不是從個人的心理角度出發去訴述故事中社會的展開，（無論是實在的或幻想的）。換言之，就是作者當從事實的展開與現實環境的變動中去理解個别心理的一般性和特殊性，丨丨從現實的動態中分柝個别的心理。倘若不根據現實的進程，僅憑個人的幻想，那正是浪漫主義的玄渺的空想，這種主觀的見解，使作品的内容染了空洞的强調，結果是歪曲了現實的許多公式主義的作品，就是犯了這方面的錯誤。</p>
<p>現實主義應當是運用着正確的世界觀，去剖解現實的題材，作者把現實的動的恣態從故事中展開，並且很小心的把握着正確的部分。第一；作者要看見社會的發展過程，和推動這過程决定這發展的各種根本的力，不只在說明，還要意識地的去認識那種前進的趨勢，所以，現實主義的作品，决不再是暴露的東西。第二；現實的觀法，不能是表面的，當要深切的洞視到内部的對立的同一性。不能把對立的同一性看成實例的總和。社會的發展進程，是包含着互相矛盾互相排拒的現象的，在其自身運動中截取一段過程，仍然含着渾一的分裂，及其更進一步的統一與對立。這非要從社會的動的方面去把握不可。</p>
<h3 id="c286">鼠（下） <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>被咬破鞋子，迷信一點的人是認爲不祥的，猶其官吏忌諱最深。早晨大家洗過臉，離開飯時間尙早，照例各人燃上一支烟閒談。但在吃飯時桌上却不見［烟突］，都以爲一下是買鞋子去了，於是就談鞋子，飯也吃得較往常特别有味。等到大家再重反回房子裏，却見［烟突］一個人坐着，凝神望着自己床下。</p>
<p>［怎麽，氣得飯也不吃了，烟突？］</p>
<p>另一個人燃上一枝［飯後砲］，輕蔑的瞟［烟突］一眼，也揷嘴道：［哼，買一雙　鞋來了呢］，做了嘴臉，躺在床上打起睡眠過度的呵欠了。</p>
<p>［烟突］的渾名本因吹牛得來的，這時却意外的守住沈默。餘他很興奮，所有這些官們共認爲無聯而可怕的白晝已竟開始。屋内充滿着烟雲，有的蹀𨇾，有的坐在辦公桌前鈎塗圓圈，點上　算是眼睛的兩個墨圓，傍邊標上一個人名，終於無可如何的一個人暗自笑笑完事。大家暫時沈默着。因爲普遍的消化不良，烟霧間常有一陣飽吮震響着。突然[吱吱吱的]聲音從不知什麽地方呌着了，[烟突]虎的鑽進自己床下，似乎還喊出這樣的話：</p>
<p>［老虎頭上擦癢呵，穿長衫終究會着客的！跑呵，跑呵？跑不了的！］</p>
<p>同時和他一起滾出一個荆篾編織的籠子來，一隻老鼠吱吱呌着，在裏面撞來衝去，因爲想突圍，沒有顧慮到腦殻會碰傷的事。烟突］將鼠籠高高舉在頭上，在外面跳躍着，似乎還呌喊些什麽話，喧閙中聽不淸楚，大槪是很英雄的罷。</p>
<p>但一個問題來了，將怎樣處治這獵獲的俘虜呢。</p>
<p>記得小時候每當捉到一匹鼠，是要趕到各家隣舍找貓的。貓是陰險而且狡猾的東西，很懫罹禍，雖三顧茅廬亦未必甘心就擒，所以爲覔一隻貓，往往千方百計化去老半天功夫。大約是所謂［勞苦愈多則快樂愈大］罷，迨好容易請到一位貓夫子，何嘗僅喜得流出眼涙，簡直要手舞足蹈了。那是一種很有趣的玩法，呌做［貓吊尾］，將鼠用繩索紥在貓的尾巴上，恰使貓咬不住鼠爲合宜，然後將貓放開，這塲戲就開始了：貓鈎回頭想吃下鼠，鼠怕得咕咕呌着，貓更怕鼠咬了自己尾閭，想急於吃掉，於是就團團轉着，咪咪咕咕的呌聲雜在一起，一直到大家厭時爲止。這惡捉劇雖然不大［人道］，孩子們却也不大理會。</p>
<p>官吏已竟不是孩子，適逢行使權力的時候，終要翻出一些新的花樣，經過一翻小爭執，終於全體同意：點天燈。實在這花樣並不新，不過是以前施諸人的典刑現在用來施諸老鼠罷了。</p>
<p>在某一時期人類是殘忍的，狠愛殺伐，在沒有人可做犧牲的時候，就找上了畜牲。這是一個狠可觀的决刑，大家等着，遲暮也終於到了，大家齊集在衙門後面的空塲上，單等喝最後一聲彩。雖然只是一隻鼠，情形倒也同看殺人差不多。</p>
<p>全身澆過火油的老鼠，引着火也未始不是壯觀。只見它一個火球般在空塲上滾着，跑着滾着，發出吱吱吱悽厲的鳴聲，這面跑跑，那面滾滾，正前進得有勁突然轉回頭來，似乎想尋一安適的洞府藏身。縱然微乎其兩的生命，尙且知道逃生，雖明明知道全身着了火，一切都不會有望了。十幾分鐘丨丨也許只不過幾分鐘之後，在拆腰跌足的喝彩聲中，它不能不停止掙扎倒下去了。到了並水覔得安然喪身的葬所。</p>
<p>此後老鼠的聲勢煞减了許多，雖依舊在頂棚上馳騁，終因家口銳减之故，已不如先前被猖了。敢出來逍遥散步的更是絕無僅有。［點天燈］的處刑倒還夜夜可見，却也不復有最初的興緻，有人已寗願坐在窗下看燈花了。</p>
<p>自然，老鼠尙未能根株盡絕，呌做［烟突］的人因爲凟職却已被撤，臨去的前夕似乎還恨恨的說過：</p>
<p>［老鼠，老鼠！天下儘有許多英雄都栽（註）到老鼠嘴裏！</p>
<p>如此一個英雄，還不能忘懷那被咬破的鞋。不久捕鼠籠也不知去向了，老鼠又猖獗起來，漸漸敢在桌上檯下散步了。</p>
<p>（註）栽倒的意思。栽跟斗的省略語。</p>
<h3 id="c287">［子愷漫畫我輯］序 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 盧蓀</p>
<p>因爲愛看申報自由談的文章，便把自由談一期期地積存了起來。最近把牠淸理了一下，分訂三大本；並且各給牠畫了一張自以爲十分美觀的圖案封面。此外，又把裏面登載的子愷先生所作的漫畫，一塊塊用刀挖了下來；然後買了幾張灰色的粉紙摺成一頁頁的和十六開書本子那樣大，把漫畫第頁貼上兩塊。這樣便另外訂成了一本畫册。又給牠畫上一張封面，題曰子愷漫畫我輯。</p>
<p>說起來，我似乎是個有［收藏癖］（？）的人，不過所藏的也只限於我所歡喜的書報而已。因此我對於報紙副刋，只要是我所喜，無不保存得周周全全；而且裝訂成自覺很是美觀的地步。記得這種習慣的養成，還遠在我初進中學的和一年，讀了上海民國日報的覺悟所引起的；以後，這種工作便一直不曾間斷過。可是，那些初期的工作品，因爲丢在上海的友人那裏，結果已給［一二八］的砲火燬去了，直到現在還使我感着無限的痛惜！</p>
<p>對於這種麻煩的收藏工作，過去曾有不少的朋友問過我：究竟有什麽意義？使我無法回答，只好含糊地說一句［我歡喜］。</p>
<p>實在的，我不是學者，不是一個專門的研究者，我做這工作，根本就沒有什麽企圖和野心。除了以便自己偶然翻閱翻閱外，只是因爲我歡喜牠，我有興趣，我歡喜這樣做；我便</p>
<p>要這樣做了。</p>
<p>但是，子愷先生的漫畫旣是附刋在自由談裏，我爲什麽又要一塊塊地把牠挖下來另外訂成一個册子呢？庆也是有着另外的幾個原因。丨</p>
<p>第一，由於我對子愷漫畫特别的喜愛。</p>
<p>第二，在我積存的自由談裏，子愷漫畫從摸索到餛飩擔，一共總有了六十幾幀，算算够得上訂成一個册子。</p>
<p>第三，看起來可以更開心點。</p>
<p>若是要問我爲什麽對子愷漫畫會特别的喜愛？這不僅因爲子愷先生作畫的手術高深；而給予我最大的喜愛的，乃是畫面的題材與畫裏的内容。</p>
<p>這裏使我憶起一個深刻的直到現在還不曾磨滅的印象來，也就是子愷漫畫給予我的最初的認識。這印象，便是四年多以前子愷先生在［中學生］上所作的一幅漫畫。那時我還是個中學生；那幅漫畫，現在我不用閉上眼睛，只須稍爲一想，淸楚地彷佛就放在我的面前一般：一個戴了眼鏡穿着洋式服裝的靑年，挾着書本和文具，跨着輕快的步子，經過一個愁眉苦臉，肩上壓着笨重湯團担子的靑年面前；此外除了ＴＫ的簽名外，上面寫着一個標題是小學時代的同學。</p>
<p>那幅漫畫，當時使我墮入一個極長的深思裏去，幾乎無法分解地和畫兒同化：使我想起假期回家時所遇着的那些小學時代的同學來；有的成了小販，有的做了苦力，有的……就這樣，在我的心田上輕輕地給她撒下了悲哀的種子；然而我覺得，這悲哀的引起，對於我的精神上都是一種有益的［舒服］。</p>
<p>［因爲豐子愷畫兒的表面誠然淺顯易解，沒存什麽奥妙與新奇，可是畫裏的含義並不膚淺的，那一處不顯現着人生？偶一體味吧，你便會從而發現你自己的悲苦與煩恨，而覺得這畫兒是能够作你悲苦的代言人。］</p>
<p>丨錄周啟［豐子愷論］。</p>
<p>在子愷漫畫裏所出現的人物和事件，全是親切的；畫面的綫條，永遠是那麽簡單的幾筆，什麽人都看得懂，什麽人看了心裏都會覺得一陣沒來由的輕鬆，而且很容易使你留下個明快的印象。丨這便是子愷先生最大的成功了。</p>
<p>子愷先生除了會作漫畫，又是一個會寫小品散文的能手；讀他的小品散文，也如讀他的漫畫一般地親切有味。因此在他的漫畫裏，也受着他那會寫小品散文的才能的帮助，丨常常使畫兒的標題標得那樣好；有時正是補助了他那簡單構圖的不足。</p>
<p>就拿我所輯的這六十幾幀的漫畫來說吧，幾乎無一幀不是靠着他那恰當的標題，才越發使畫兒的含義表現得更加完美起來。</p>
<p>像盾，“Ａ　Ｂｏｙ　ａｎｄ　Ａ　Ｄｏｇ”第九十九拍，他們的Ｓｏｆａ，衛生設備，多樣統一等，都有着深長的幽默意味。</p>
<p>東隣吊罷西隣賀，五卅之歌，三與一之比等，都表現了深刻的諷刺。</p>
<p>你給我削瓜，我給你打扇，拿下來，我們要迎提燈會等，更表現了孩子們天眞的童心。　　綠與白，柳蔭，等，簡直是一篇美麗的散文，一首音節調和的詩了。</p>
<p>而目的地，賣漿，剃頭擔，乘凉，糖糕，黄包車上，阿要看到等，全是取材於我們環境事物的速寫。我們看了這些速寫，對於下凡的生活情形，不免被他引起　职大的興趣與注意。</p>
<p>還有那些農家的生活情形，以及那些古老的還存在鄉間的舊式生活情形，差不多已給我們這些久留都市的人忘記了，或竟不知道的，子愷先生却用他藝術的畫筆，給他留下了一個永久的紀念。如：二弦琴，五娘娘，牽牛織女星，南畝，話桑麻，等，都是。</p>
<p>此外，有現實的悲哀事件的寫照，如：施粥，施茶，雲霓，八十七歲等，都是感人很深的作品。</p>
<p>貼完了子愷先生的漫畫，又從論語二週紀念號上剪下一幀子愷先生的照片，貼在卷首；把自由談上周啟作的豐子愷論貼到卷尾。</p>
<p>這樣，這本我輯便算完成了。</p>
<p>雖然不是拿去出版，然而這本册子，一定會有朋友借着看一看的；他們不免又要問我，做這種工作，究竟有什麽意義？爲免除重復地用語言回答的麻煩起見，覺得有做一篇序文的必要。</p>
<p>因此我才寫出上面的這些話，算是自序。</p>

<p>［什麽！那個孩子？不願意看一眼周圍幾英里内唯一明理的女孩子？］［你想我在這兒等什麽，我的親愛的丨我的親愛的丨我的親愛的？………什麽？你等待。你只要等待。你到了明天會曉得。我不久要丨］</p>
<p>［貝珊！貝珊！貝珊！］老嘉維爾在裏面狂嘷着。［貝珊！丨我的烟斗！］那位肥胖的瞎子懶到極點。他不願抬起手來拿那些她曾小心放在他的肘邊的東西。在那間會客室中（在這裏面，他是熟悉一切，正如未喪明一樣）他如果不把她呌到身邊來，把一切殘忍的重責都加在她的肩上，他連四肢都不願動彈，他也不願從椅子上站起，甚至連一隻脚交义到另一隻脚也不願意。沒有她的在近辦服侍，他一口東西都不吃，他需要帮助已超過他缺陷以外，還是說存心要磨折她對些。她立定　些時，在暗中咬着牙齒，然後掉轉身來，慢慢地走進門去。</p>
<p>海格波行船長走回到他的鏟那面去。嘉維爾的小屋中的呼喊已停止下來，不久以後，樓下會客室的窗上亮起來。一個男子從街的　頭用着堅定的優閒的步伐走來，但他似乎看到海格波特船長，因爲他曾走回來一兩步。這時在兩邊的天上，依然還有着一道冷的白光。這男子態度非常有趣的依靠在大門上。</p>
<p>［你一定是海格波特船長。］他從容肯定地說。</p>
<p>老頭子旋轉身來，拔起他的剷，有些被這奇怪的聲音驚嚇。</p>

<h3 id="c290">死讀書和讀死書（下） <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>怎樣呌讀死書呢？讀死書和死讀書不一樣，或者是所讀的材料不佳，或者讀書不得其法，則活書也變爲死書，所以讀死書可分數種解釋。</p>
<p>一、是囫囫吞棗，食古不化，不能應用。</p>
<p>二、是讀完全無用之書，或竟有害之書。</p>
<p>三、是東翻西閱，隨便看看，毫無系統。</p>
<p>第一種，我國從前讀書人；大抵如此，所以有秀才先生，而竟不能寫一條子者。第二種，亦弊病很多，如近日學生專喜看武俠小說，或神怪小說，或愛情小說之類，至有無錫某米行學徒四人，突告失蹤，出門訪道等異想天開的事發生，至於第三種毛病，更爲普通，我卽大患此毛病的一人，所以讀書毫無進步，毫不得益。</p>
<p>讀書須要有目的，有條理，有系統，因爲書是汗牛充梀的，非特我國古來的書，讀不勝讀，現在加以外國的書，更沒有精神時間，去一一考究。只能拿我心中所欲研究，和喜歡研究的書，拿來研究研究，從前我國的學者，有［經學家，］有史學家，有［理學家，］有詞章家，］有［考據家］有［箋注家，］有［訓詁家］等等，他們多是注意一種學問，而悉心去研究。他們研究學問的方法，是很對的，可惜他們所研究的對象，不能說他完全無用，而枉費精神勞而無功的，也着實不少。這種研究的方法，和外國學者研究［哲學］，［科學］，［心理學］，［法學］，［社會學］等等，同一方法，不過研究的對象，有［死］和［活］的分别而已。</p>
<p>此種說法，完全爲讀書而讀書，爲研求學問而讀書的人說法。但是此種讀書人，有此精力，有此閒裕的，我國能有幾人。此外則爲做官而讀書，爲經商而讀書，欲在社會尋飯碗而讀書，爲欲掛名學籍而讀書的，實是多數。只能拿普通應用的書，找來研究，原是另一種的讀書方式。</p>
<p>讀書，私塾式，和學堂式，天然不同。私塾式讀書太苦，而學堂式讀書太甜。私塾式是把讀書時間，過於經濟，固不相宜。而學堂式則把讀書時間，過於浪費，亦屬可惜。現往學堂中讀書，其學費之鉅。家屬不易担負，且不必談。而讀書的時間，除［寒假］［春假］長期之［暑假］外，一星期中，有［星期日］的休假，還有［各種紀念］日及［運動會］等等，一年的讀書的時間，祇得其半，是何等可惜的一件事？</p>
<p>或謂私塾中讀的是死書，學堂中讀的是活書，恐也未必盡然，在學堂中，同級學生數十人，有智愚的不同，有嗜好的各别，有喜歡英文的，有喜歡算學的，有喜歡國文的，有任何學問不喜歡的。所以同一書籍，而各生的心得，有大大的不同，故［私塾式］的讀書，是［撳住牛頭吃草］，而［學堂式］的讀書是［鴨吃田螺］，其弊病原相差無多呢？因此善於讀書的，不但讀好的書籍，可以獲益，而讀壞的書籍，也可以獲益，故孔子云，［三人行，必有我師焉。擇其善者而從之，其不善者而改之］。</p>
<p>總而言之，不要讀書則已，如要讀書，第一個就是［要］字，能［要］便肯去研究，能研究便感到有興趣，有興趣便有進步。故俗語云，［天下無難事，只怕有心人］。苟其有心，則何事不可成，倘然不要，便不肯去研究，不去研究，興趣從那裏來呢？至於讀書的人，能　應用，和不能彀應用又在乎其人。宋有善爲不龜手之藥者，世世以洴澼統爲事，客聞之，買其方千金，以說吳王，裂地而封］。此卽能應用和不能應用的差别啊。</p>

<h3 id="c291">論兒童讀物 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 胡仁木</p>
<p>近年來，書店裏出了很多兒童讀物。</p>
<p>如果說，眞是爲了顧及兒童知識來出這些書，那　這種現象是可取的。但是，說句老實話，這些書店來出兒童書，差不多都是爲的牟利。</p>
<p>牟利，也沒有關係，開書店雖說爲了傳播文化，自然一方面也須顧到自身營業，所以牟利並不是矛盾的事情。只是，因爲牟利就不顧及讀物的内容，這影響非常壞。我們看到他們出的兒童書，看見這些作者賜給兒童們的智識糧食，覺得實在有好些是不能讓我們贊同，領敎的。</p>
<p>在這些讀物裏，屬於說敎式的，自然是舉不勝舉。此外，遠出事實之外，與兒童實生活完全無關的製作，也實在不少。還有猪狗牛着那一套舊調，也依然搬出來重演一番。如果只是依樣畫葫蘆，印出這些兒童作品，看來莫如不作，不印的好。</p>
<p>兒童的知識，應該給以開發，這固然是事實，但是在開發他們知識之前，總得顧及到他們的正當路向才對。像上面所說的一類作品，有的要把兒童敎成老夫子，有的不適合兒童本身環境，有的把他們打入猪狗牛羊羣中，試問對兒童有何補益？這果然是開發兒童知識所趨的正路？</p>
<p>伊林的童話，所以能够得到我國以及全世界兒童的歡迎，說來道理很簡單，就因爲他是寫的［兒童的實生活］。我覺得兒童讀物的製作，應該注意這一點。</p>
<h3 id="c292">被遺忘的人 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>每天消磨在那五色燈光，金屬樂器，烟味，酒精味水粉味的混合氛圍的生活圈子裏，感覺機能漸漸地給弄得遲鈍起來了。因爲每天所見到的人和物眞是瞧得膩而且够討厭的。可是有一天我的感覺猛的回復到原有的靈敏了。就是從這一天起，發現了一朶新被編排進花的隊伍裏的花。丨丨一個年輕的姑娘，她的坐位是靠近在音樂檯邊的，不大優勢的角落裏，當她第一夜走入這生疏多變化的環境裏，我就隨着留神注意她了。一個領班的男子引着指示她自己的位子在那兒，但是她沒有立刻坐了下去而遲疑地站着，好像是說自今天就坐在這兒過着這樣的日子般那麽自問着。站了一會，終於坐下來了。</p>
<p>人們尤其是所有的同伴，都用着尖銳的而又怪異的眼綫釘在她身上。使這個完全不習慣於那塲面的新來的人的舉動更加侷促着，她的腦袋稍微低了一點，眼睛儘瞧着地板，很久沒動一動，這樣地寂寞地坐着。</p>
<p>無言地坐了半天，一個靑年男子走上來樓　她跳開去了。在跳着的時候，她的眼睛還是不敢自由地瞥着週圍的人們。而且表情顯出十分不自然。而在燈亮音樂停的時候。靜寂裏就起了一陣人聲脚步聲的騷動。她走了回來一時竟亂了，認不淸自己的座位，却坐到旁邊另一個的位子去。</p>
<p>一種全無諒解的冷笑馬上打每個人的鼻腔裏嘘出來。於是她的臉孔飛上一片紅霞，直紅到耳根。</p>
<p>能够看見她腦袋抬上來是常當在燈光熄了的時候，到了燈放亮她又急急把眼睛去瞧着地板。彷彿怕見人，也怕讓人看見似的。</p>
<p>就這樣寂寞地生活下去了。天天扮得像夜開花的百合那麽鮮麗，一支花似的栽植在無數的花叢裏，從那個陌生人的懷裏溜到另一個陌生人的懷裏，以自己靑春的身體，靑春的笑，去換取一點報酬。然而亦不見得就容易給人賞識的。像她，每晚空坐着的時候總多過於有人來跳的時候。就在禮拜尾人頂多的晚上，其他的同伴都逢到了格外多的知音者，沒一隻音樂空過，是一個禮拜中最愉快的日子了。</p>
<p>誰都全身充滿了勁，笑嘻嘻地。可是，只有她仍是冷冷的坐着，甚至於空坐了整一夜，沒人從她面前走來，沒人過問過。那麽孤獨地送着時間的虚度，看同伴多得意地笑着。於是自己的臉色更加沉了下來，沉到無邊的憂鬱裏了。</p>
<p>一顆寂寞的心裏和被人忘記的姑娘啊！</p>
<p>她亦如同伴們一樣的年輕，一樣的塗着靑春美麗的顔色。只因爲她的美麗的顔色讓一層生活的陰影掩住着丨無端黯淡着了。</p>
<p>時常先其他的人而來，同樣時常先看其他的人而離去，實在太孤寂。老是那麽一個人坐着坐着。瞧着别的同伴笑瞇瞇迎着前來的男子站上來，在燈影迷影下，把下巴子掛在對方的肩膊上，喞喞的說個不休。想着要討人喜歡也要裝出笑嘴兒就看得出硬切上去同哭沒分别，仍然沒人鑑賞到她那哭似的的笑。</p>
<p>日子馳得快，可以裁在花叢裏的日子也是很短促。而爲了過度的担憂。和寂寞的侵蝕，她的眉尖的鬱悴的陰影愈加濃厚了。</p>
<p>對於幻想的希望亦就更少了。</p>
<p>這樣寂寞的一朶花，寂寞地開到無數的花叢裏，又寂寞地憔悴下去。開花的時候無人加以讚美，憔悴的時候更無人嘆息和惋惜。</p>
<p>一個被遺忘的人和一顆孤獨的心啊。</p>
<p>她來的時候，只曾使我注意過，使我的覺感突然敏銳起來。此外彷彿沒第二個人瞧見她一樣。如今她已悄悄地離開這里了，我的因她而敏銳的感覺又隨着回到遲鈍，而且加上一重在她身上傳染來的爲她的寂寞而寂寞的暗雲。</p>

<h3 id="c301">幾乎成爲事實的琪恩哈羅喪明之痛（上） <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>要是最近在本埠出映的［佳兒佳婦］中的主角，琪恩哈羅，眼睛瞎了？那當然是一件不可思議的事，但是在不久以前，那却不是什麽絕對不可能的事。這件事外面都沒有聽見說過。就是琪恩哈羅自己，亦諱莫如深。直等到最近，她的醫生告訴了她，一切的危險已經過去了，她才和一位新聞記者談起這件事，外面才有些知道。在過去四年之中，琪恩哈羅實在時時在恐慌之中，害怕她的一雙迷人的眼睛眞的瞎了。在過支四年之中，她亦就絕對不知人家談起這件事。祇有她家裏親近的幾個人，知道她這幾年來，在身體上和精神上，所受的是什麽痛苦！</p>
<p>現在這個秘密，可以公開了，因爲她的醫生，已經担保她不至於有喪明之痛了。不過這件事，怎樣又談起來的呢？却又是一件意外之事引起來的。大家都知琪恩哈羅的一只脚，是有些毛病的。她好幾年前，在拍［地獄天使］的時候，跌了一交，以致跌斷了她脚裏的三根小骨頭。這三根小骨頭，一直沒有接好，所以常常使她站立不穩，而致於傾跌。上一個月，她又跌了一交，自從她花園的矮墻上跌了下來。差不多經過了好幾個禮拜，才能安步如常。就在那個時候，有一位素識的新聞記者去訪問她，便中才談起她眼睛的事情。當那位新聞記者安慰她的時候，琪恩就說道：［這算得什麽？我的眼睛所受的苦才厲害哩。］琪恩說了，知道已經洩露了秘密，於是索興說了出來道：［這件事我還沒有和别人講過。不過現在事情一大半已經成了過去的事，我們無妨談談。說起來，那件事亦是發生於拍［地獄天使］的時候的。你記得［地獄天使］的末一節，不是用五彩的嗎。那時攝製五彩影片的方法，當然還幼穉得很。那時他們還都在試騐之中。他們所知道的亦很少。他們僅知道拍五彩影片的時候，燈光一定要比攝平常影片的時候强三四倍。所以四面都裝滿了孤光燈，演員走路的地方都沒有了。我拍了許多近景。在拍近景的時候，許多大燈都圍繞着鏡頭的旁邊。我拍戲的時候，一定要眼睛看看鏡頭，許多燈光直接地向我的眼睛放射着。熱度是非常之高，但是我當時並沒有覺得高到什麽地步。我接連拍了兩天的近景。每天晚上回家的時候，就覺得頭痛如裂，一刻不可忍。我當時還以爲頭痛，不過是眼睛過勞的所致。可是我過了幾天，頭痛越來越厲害起來了。不久我的眼睛漸漸不便當起來了。我本來是眼力很强的，但是後來··覺得模糊看不淸了。</p>
<p>［最後我就去看一位醫生。他替我詳細地檢騐了一下。他的診斷，差不多是不可信的。他說我的眼睛燒壞了。眼珠外面包着一層透明的薄膜·受了强烈的燈光燒焦了，好像人的皮膚，被强烈的陽光晒焦的一樣。當然我的皮膚，搽着一層厚厚的蠟，是有保護的，但是我的眼睛，是毫無保護的。當然這是大家所沒有聽見過的奇事。就有那位醫生亦說，那是極少見的事，不過他的診斷，是千眞萬確的。於是他就要開始用手術了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c302">評［狂風暴雨］ <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｔｏｒｍ丨巴黎映</p>
<p>原名［雷雨］（Ｔｈｅ　Ｔｂｕｎｄｅｒｌｏｅｍ）的這一劇本，是俄國名作家阿司脫洛夫司基Ｏｓｔｒｏｖｔｋｉｙ（１８２３－１８８６）的五十多個劇本中底名作之一，也是俄國舞台劇目中的熟戲之一。在狂風暴雨過後的蘇聯的一九三三年，於批判地接受藝術遺産，與回顧過去的生活，以昭示及建設此後種種的意義之下，攝成了這一影片，並不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>得在這兒順便提及的，蘇聯的攝製［循環］，［雷雨］，甚至於莫泊桑與巴爾扎克的小說，不有浮面地理解爲蘇聯電影的主要轉向，因爲這與好萊塢的製作傾向於［娜娜］，［閨怨］以及［基度山恩仇記］等。在意義與態度上却是不相同的，不是嗎？後者的這一傾向主要地表現［題材的枯竭］與［生意眼］上，是大家所共認的了。而前者是由於電影文化丨别的文化部門也一樣丨發展到某一階段時回顧，前瞻與横攝。</p>
<p>自然，看完了［雷雨］以後，會感覺到它。是和［生路］，［金山］以及［傀儡］等確是不同的。可是這不同並不就减低了［雷雨］的攝製的意義。</p>
<p>原作者阿氏是以［刻劃當時的社會人物之聖手］見稱的，影片的編者凡史伯柴夫與導演彼得洛夫更忠實地，客觀地表演與完成了劇中的人物，也就是典型的地暴露了那個時代社會支配中的人們。</p>
<p>老寡婦婆婆的吝嗇，頑固，殘酷，與假借宗敎丨以沒有帶來三萬元的裝奩，便認爲是媳婦的罪惡，而駡媳婦與兒子分别和傾訴苦衷時的擁抱爲［無恥］，勒令媳婦宣誓［永不走近窗前去閒眺，永不窺視任何年靑的男人；］要把媳婦［生葬活埋］的使她受苦等。</p>
<p>商人者羣的虚僞與浮妄丨說到［一切商人都誠實，公平，］女顧客說：［尺頭好些］，他却捉住她的手說：［甜如朱古力糖，］而以博得同事們嘲笑他［對女顧客太温柔］爲榮耀；隨便打小徒弟的巴掌，以及把學徒當做木頭一般，往地上抛擲等。那個自己進過高等商校，妹妹進大學，承繼到一百萬元的商家貴公子的自私殘酷，與貪慾丨他第一次來找喀蒂林娜時，她以［我是有夫之婦］拒絕他，她最後奔逃出黑暗的家庭與［淫婦必須殺死］的敎俗來要求跟他同往西伯利亞時，他只說］爲了自己的前程，得去努力］［願上帝保佑你］，而抛棄了［同居過十夜］的她，上馬往西伯利亞去了等。以及喀蒂林娜的受壓迫，與找不到出路丨丨連不願說一句謊話來騙［偉大的，親愛的婆婆］的女人，姑娘把錀匙給她去開後門會情人，她不接受，以［有夫之婦］拒情人，終於接受了人家的愛，以至當衆懺悔等，這些在［狂風暴雨］之前夕的當時，俄羅斯的深刻的典型的描寫，給與［狂風暴雨］之後的人們來看時，將作何種感想啊！</p>
<p>導演彼得洛夫在這個片子中，總括地說一句是凌亂與有些重複。可是細膩與處處着重於戲的氛圍的描寫。却是他的成功之點。不像許多好來塢導演只注重主角的做戲，而忽略了戲的空氣。在結婚的歡宴中，婆婆因斤斤較量妝奩而不歡，與新婦第一次向新郎說着自己的過去時新郎却只顧喝酒，和不脫靴就睡倒在床上這兩塲暗示整個劇的中心，與劇中人的性格。那種誇張婚姻的形式，不問内容的是否圓滿這一點，也是深有意義的。晨曦，月夜與伏爾迦等的攝取，形成了極美的畫面。至於音响效果，更是很大的成功。</p>
<p>演技方面，由於性格配合，與導演處理的得當，每個人都成功地做到了應該表現的程度。其中飾古得力的茄洛夫是在［生路］中是與我們見過了的。這兒他的戲雖沒有在［生路］飾惡漢福姆卡那樣的多，可是給予人們深刻的印象，却並不减少於其他演員的。</p>
<h3 id="c303">評［天空女侍］ <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ａｉｒ　Ｈｏｓｔｅｓｓ丨國泰</p>
<p>一般的說，美國電影的採取題材，確是很狹隘的。跑馬，賽球，鬥拳，競艇，飛機等富於刺激性的題材，都給美國電影作家多次的使用着。這一現象，給與人們的印象是美國電影的題材缺乏。可是相反的，我們亦看到他們不敢從廣大的人羣中間去採取更廣泛的題材，如工塲農邨中就有搜取不竭的素材等待作家去採取。所以這决不能說是題材的缺乏，而是他們意識的縮小題材的範疇。至於刺戟性的素材之運用，還有其生意眼的意義强調着在，乃是不消說得的了。</p>
<p>現在我們又看到以航空爲題材的［天空侍女］了。關於這一影片，我們除了看着在航空的題才中織成了一幅男女間的羅曼斯之外，是找不出什麽東西的。自然這種定型的故事，我們在美國電影中常常可以看到，在這裏爲愛情而勇敢，正是劇作者最明顯的主題。</p>
<p>爲了愛情糾紛的構成，一個多錢而且熾慾的寡婦之出現，乃是很有必要的了。在這裏，和一般電影中所用過的方法一樣，寡婦潑酒在飛行家身上，到房裏去換睡衣，再則寡婦肉感的誘惑他，當飛行家的妻來找他的時候，她有意的要他給自己燃着香烟，以顯其親暱的狀態：這些都是觀衆們像家常便飯一般的吃得厭膩了的。</p>
<p>也許可以說導演的手法還好，譬如說當女飛行家的兩個恊人打架的時候，就打得很緊張，很像眞的一樣。此外當女飛行家知道丈夫要去寡婦家的時候，那聯接的幾塲戲也很好，自然這是說導演將一個忠實於愛情的妻子的性格，描寫了出來，便是他的成功。至於後面的高潮，却不見佳。</p>
<h3 id="c304">金城四部曲 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 松花</p>
<p>國産電影的勢燄，近來好像有點沉落下去了。近這沉寂的空氣中，忽聞金城將連續公映四大國産鉅片，這不是值得報告的一個好消息嗎？現在，我且把這四部片子的大略情形，介紹於下。</p>
<p>神女［神女］一片，爲聯華影業公司最新出品，主角爲阮玲玉黎鏗章志直等，導演是吳永剛。吳在電影界，已有極悠久的歷史，凡稍稍留意於電影事業的，類能道之，他担任導演，雖係初次；但收獲之佳，竟出乎吾人意料之外。此片係描寫呻吟於地獄中的一般女性，迫於環境，不得不去操此肉生涯，而她的靈魂，固是始終純潔的。片中對於這種女性的兩重生活，其良知和外力的衝突，有極明確的表現，深刻沉痛，得未曾有，致於阮玲玉和黎鏗等的表情，當然是不會使人失望的，這部片子，已定於七日（星期五）公映了。</p>
<p>桃李刦　這是電通公司的一部處女作。三友式錄音的成績，在國産電影界中，已早有相當地位。不過自己攝製影片，這還是第一次。而它的成績，竟有出乎意料的優美，這不能不說是國産片中的一個好現象。片的内容，力趨實現，描寫一班靑年，受着社會不景氣和人心險詐的影響，感覺失業的痛苦，而對於夫妻合作的精神，更有明顯的指示。它的一切，都朝新的方向進行，非一般落伍電影所可同日語。導演是應雲衛，主角是袁牧之，陳波兒等，他們在話劇舞台上，都負有相當的聲譽。所以，［桃李刦］的演出，可以說是令人嘆觀止了。</p>
<p>飛花村　［飛花村］這個片子，平心說，　是藝華公司一部優美的出品，不但它的故事，曲折哀楚。而技巧方面，亦頗有驚人的成績　鄭應時這位導演，他那靈敏的手腕，在［春潮］一片中，早就給了我們一個很好的印象了。他，導演這［飛花村］更是一步不肯放鬆，所以結果令人非常滿意。再說到高占非的表演，早就有人說他進步神速，將來未可限量，請你們等着再來看看［飛花村］裏的高占非吧，一定更會使你們滿意的。尙有胡萍的表情，更有出人意料之外的收穫，王乃東的歹角，當然是值得讚美的了。</p>
<p>大路　這是聯華公司本年度一部鉅作。片子雖沒有開映，但是［大路］中的兩闋名歌［大路歌］和［開路先鋒］，早就傳遍在上海的空氣中了。詩人導演孫瑜，是轉變電影作風的老祖宗，當然他在［大路］裏，又有許多新的貢獻。聯華全部男明星金燄，鄭君里，張翼，章志直，羅朋，韓蘭根，尙冠武等，一齊出馬，並且各人都是重要角色；此外還有兩位女星黎莉莉，陳燕燕另入合作。我們只要看一看這許多名字，就可以猜到它不是一部平凡的作品了。致於劇情的慷慨激昻，更是在國産影片中難得看見的。</p>
<h3 id="c305">鄔麗珠夜哭李法西 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>月明公司的大隊人馬，由導演任彭年率領之下，在蘇州拍攝［昏狂］的外景，他們帶着發電機，所以雖在離城很遠的金山浜，入晚一定燈光照耀，演員們因爲沒有其他消遣，便隨便想出些玩意兒，每晚引得鄉人們圍觀，歡聲雷動，女主角鄔麗珠，是阿拉藉，到十時熄燈時，時常拉起寗波調，戲哭編劇者李法西，而吳玲，陳佩珠等女演員，又從而和之，於是一片凄慘聲，眞像死了人似的，而這却是每晚臨睡時的壓軸戲。</p>

<p>— 仲嘉</p>
<p>潘茜看見了莊尼，不覺暗暗一驚，怎麽他這樣彷彿和他父親一樣。那種音容笑貌，竟好像他父親重生一樣。他以爲永遠看不刦那種笑容，永遠聽不見那種聲音的了。她看見了他，當然不能說，她不認識他父親。她就是要裝，亦裝不像的。她亦不能說，她已經忘記了。忘記約翰？她想起了他的名字，就要覺得心酸的……就是到了現在……想起了他們在一起的時候……一齊出去散步的情景……一切在暮夜昏黄的時候，坐着的光陰，她决然地，傲然地拒絕了他兒子每星期給她的津貼……那筆可以使她一生不須再愁衣食的欵子……她一生所作的爲的事，已是不一而足，但是她寗可當呌化子不能從約翰的兒子手裏，受他的津貼。她要是受了他的津貼，就是將她一生之中，惟一完美的東西出賣了。那就是將她所慷慨給與約翰的神聖愛情，收了代價了。所以她終究不肯受莊尼的接濟，雖然莊尼常常爲她的生活憂慮。現在她犯了新案子，逹理庭長又要去將她的老友的兒子呌出來，又要使他添加些憂慮，這是使她感到極度的難受的。一回兒莊尼來了，逹理和他在别室裏商量了一回，然後跑進潘茜坐着的屋子。潘茜看見他們走進來，立即抬起頭來。逹理先開口道：［潘茜，密爾斯先生和我，已經將你的案子討論過了。他勸我不要過於難爲你。所以我亦不送你到島上去了。我們要將你送到養老堂裏去。］莊尼的心，着實有些不忍看了那老太婆面上悲苦的樣子。潘茜突然立了起來，怒目向着他們道：［我情願進監牢！］她的兩隻手絞着表示無限痛苦在她的心中。那種地方，是我從前常去做好事的地方。那裏盡是些殘廢的老婆兒，坐在摇椅裏晒晒太陽，織織絨綫生活。你們想我就那樣完了嗎？我不幹！我要搗毁那個地方的！我要逃跑的！］可是達裏和莊尼沒有聽她的話，還是把她送到養老堂裏去了。潘茜被送到養老堂裏去之後，亦沒有逃跑，雖在那裏的管事太太們，很願意她逃跑，因爲潘茜在那裏不久，已經弄得她們束手無策了。忽然到了一天，養老堂的全堂，熱烘烘閧着，說是有一個美麗的女郎，要到養老堂去檢一位老太太，做她的母親。潘茜聽見了，覺得她逃走的機會到了，她决意自己一定可以被選的。她看着其餘的老太婆，大家都妝飾起來，有的頭上揷支木梳，有的撫些舊花邊披上了，有的戴上些不值錢的飾物。潘茜看了她們，着實替她們可憐，她們怎能和一位從前蜚聲於舞台的潘茜柏德森競爭呢。潘茜隨時隨地，都可以表演一下子，這次當然也是她表演的好機會了。到了那天，管事太太果然帶着一位如花似玉的女郎進來了。潘茜漫不經心地抬頭看着。但是出乎意料之外的，她竟不免驚慌起來。那個女郎，好似在什麽地方看見過的好想了一想，記起來了……就是在達理的半夜法庭裏看見過的……她的名字呌做亞拉班李，她是一位聲名狼藉的羽扇跳舞家。她現在竟到養老堂裏來挑選一個老太婆，去做她的母親丨丨那當然亦是他們的一種宣傳方法罷了！（未完）</p>

<p>Expected to be Completed by the End of This Month</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the matter of moving the Hebei Provincial Government to Baoding, the provincial government has been actively preparing in recent days. It has been decided to first transport the archives of the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments to Baoding. After completion, the Construction Department will move first, followed by the Civil Affairs Department, and then all other departments and the entire provincial government. It is expected that the relocation will be fully completed by the end of this month, and official business will be conducted in Baoding starting from New Year's Day next year. The provincial government has contacted the Beining Railway Bureau to arrange for transportation, with everything to be transported by train, via the Beining Railway to Fengtai Station, and then transferred to the Pinghan Railway to Baoding. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wei Jian, the Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, stated that he has not yet received an order from the central government regarding the move to Baoding. However, the buildings in Baoding are dilapidated, and there are no government offices suitable for conducting business, so repairs must be carried out first.

<h3 id="e7">Issue of Demarcation Between Hebei and Peiping <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for Opposition from Representatives of the Two Counties</p>
<p>Yuan Liang Expresses Obedience to the Central Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior sent personnel to Peiping to carry out the demarcation of the boundaries between Peiping and Hebei, but the issue has not yet been resolved. Yuan Liang arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday to discuss the matter with the Executive Yuan authorities. The people of Wanping and Daxing counties oppose the incorporation of the two counties into Peiping Municipality and have sent representatives Wang Dianjia, Gao Xurong, Zhang Yuanshun, and Fan Renfu to Beijing to petition for the cancellation of the order to demarcate the boundaries between Peiping and Hebei. The reasons are as follows: 1. Municipal facilities are different from those in rural areas. 2. Rural areas cannot bear the various housing donations, sanitation, and public security donations like those in the city. 3. The two counties originally had self-organized defense teams to maintain security, without drawing salaries. If they are incorporated into Peiping, the self-organized defense teams will inevitably be abolished, and the government will organize them instead, placing a financial burden on the people of the two counties. 4. Regarding land taxes, on average, 80% of households pay less than one yuan in taxes, and the furthest from Peiping is more than 100 li. If they have to travel back and forth for several days for such a small amount of taxes, not only will they incur travel expenses, but also time. For these four reasons, they hope that the government will cancel the order. According to Yuan Liang's secretary, Jin Jiru, Chiang Kai-shek visited half a month ago and found the four rural areas of Peiping to be dilapidated, which would affect the impression of both Chinese and foreigners. He specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Interior to redraw the boundaries between Peiping and Hebei and ordered reforms to the construction within the Peiping urban area. Some parts of Wanping and Daxing counties had already been incorporated into the municipal jurisdiction. Because the political construction of a county cannot be different, it was decided to completely incorporate the two counties into Peiping Municipality. Mayor Yuan has no preconceived notions about this. The case is currently under discussion between the Ministry of Interior and the Executive Yuan. How the demarcation will ultimately be determined will be subject to the orders of the central government. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A meeting on the demarcation between Hebei and Peiping will be held in Beijing on the 8th. The Hebei Provincial Government has received a telegram urging the dispatch of representatives, who will be Director of Civil Affairs Zhang Houwan and Director of Construction Hu Yuanhui.

<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government, following the orders of the central government, is vigorously implementing drug prohibition throughout the province and has specifically stipulated measures to be implemented by all counties in the province, authorizing county magistrates to confiscate property when they uncover trafficking offenses.

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Ting'e, the mayor of Tianjin, stated that in accordance with the Nanchang Camp Drug Prohibition Regulations transmitted by the Japanese, the city has decided to immediately implement the drug prohibition law and is planning to build an addiction treatment center capable of accommodating 1,000 people. In addition, there are many school-age children in the city who are out of school, and compulsory education will be implemented next year. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>Measures in Place for Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Financial Matters Largely Agreed Upon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang visited Chairman Chiang at the Military Council on the afternoon of the 5th to request instructions on methods for suppressing the Sichuan bandits. At 3:30 PM, he visited Minister of Finance Kong to continue discussing the financial issues of Sichuan Province. According to Chen Jiguang, Liu's representative, after Liu arrived in Beijing, he met with Chiang, Wang, Kong, and others to discuss military, political, and financial issues. Considerable progress has been made on the issue of bandit suppression. It has also been decided to strengthen the provincial government in terms of political matters, and the personnel selection is still in progress. As for the financial aspect, the result of the consultations is that no public bonds will be issued, and no loans will be raised. The central government will provide monthly assistance of a certain amount of money, with the exact figure to be determined by the central government. The reorganization of central and local tax revenues will take place after the bandit suppression work has been completed. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) As a result of Liu Xiang's negotiations with Minister of Finance Kong in Beijing, the central government has agreed to issue an estimated 40 million yuan to reorganize Sichuan's financial emergency expenses, with the amount of monthly subsidy yet to be determined.

<p>Mining Bureau Decides on Compensation Measures</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The cable of the winding engine at the Kailuan Linxi mine broke, causing workers to fall into the shaft and die tragically. It has been determined that the deceased were 28 underground workers, including Zhao Guanzhou. A pile of bones and flesh has been excavated, but the individual bodies cannot be identified. The Mining Bureau will prepare wooden coffins to hold the remains and bury them in a cleared area west of the mine. The Mining Bureau has decided to provide compensation of 250 yuan per worker and hold a memorial service. The winding engine operator Li Hong was dismissed and handed over to the authorities for legal action. The winding engine cable will be reinforced to prevent danger. The workers' families feel that the compensation is too low and are in dispute. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mining Bureau has taken steps to deal with the aftermath of the Linxi mine disaster by dismissing the winding engine operator Li Hong and handing him over to the Tangshan Public Security Bureau for legal action. Each deceased worker will receive compensation of 250 yuan, and the workers will be allowed to hold a memorial service. Mining engineers have been ordered to study the winding engine cable and make it two or three times thicker to prevent future accidents. However, the families of the deceased workers believe that the compensation is too low and are in dispute with the labor-management liaison office. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) There are over a thousand bandits entrenched outside Jieshankou. It is rumored that they belong to Liu Guitang's puppet East Asia Allied Army headquarters. He Xiaoyi, the magistrate of Zunhua County, has implemented a militia system throughout the county, forming a volunteer corps of three able-bodied men from each family, with one man providing his own firearms to jointly defend against bandits. He has also recruited several thousand men to defend between Jieshankou and Yanshankou to prevent bandits from invading. He Xiaoyi, the magistrate of Zunhua County, has reorganized the county's defense corps, expanding it to 820 men, with half stationed at Jieshankou to block bandits outside the Great Wall, and the other half patrolling within the county. The funds for this are raised from the local people. The First Brigade of the Security Forces, under Wang Zhanyuan, was previously stationed at Dongxin, Jianggongpu, and other places to defend against the rampant bandits outside the Great Wall. Now that the Zunhua militia has been formed, they have handed over the defense and withdrawn. (Special Dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Yu Youren Requests Severe Punishment for the Palace Museum Theft Incident <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, has recently submitted a proposal to the central government regarding the Palace Museum theft case, requesting severe punishment. The original text reads: "Regarding the proposal, according to the signed report of all the members of the Control Yuan, the artifacts of the Palace Museum have been repeatedly stolen and replaced. Speaking of cultural treasures, they should not be stored so carelessly. Speaking of national public assets, their loss should not be tolerated. Even based on the detailed reports in the Central Daily News regarding the types and quantities of items that have been replaced, the value is considerable. If this huge amount of money were used for the revival of rural areas or for the equipment of [missing characters], the effect would be remarkable. Now, the guards are stealing and acting with impunity, relying entirely on bandits as havens both domestically and abroad. Although the court has issued arrest warrants, not a single person has been captured. Although customs officials have conducted investigations, the scandal has been exposed overseas. The members of the Control Yuan are responsible for supervision and correction and advocate severe punishment of corruption. It is believed that the Palace Museum theft case should be severely investigated and punished. All those involved in the case should be arrested by the central government using effective methods and handed over to the competent authorities for punishment according to law. Those who are sheltering in concessions or have fled abroad should be extradited by the government and punished accordingly. Their property should be confiscated. In the future, detailed measures should be established for the preservation of artifacts to prevent further encroachment and uphold the ownership of the people. The members unanimously agree and propose to forward this to the Central Political Council for deliberation and implementation." In light of this, the views of the members are essential and should be submitted accordingly. Whether or not this is appropriate is respectfully submitted for public decision. Member and President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Zhuo, the Director of the Police Department, has ordered his subordinates to vigorously search and arrest opium offenders in order to eliminate opium in the city. In recent months, over a thousand opium offenders and countless opium paraphernalia have been seized and sent to the Jiangning District Court in batches for punishment according to law. Searches continued on the 5th, and many more were seized. Consequently, there were frequent processions of prisoners being escorted through the streets. Among those arrested were many monks and Taoists who were found to be smoking opium. On the morning of the 5th, the municipal government ordered the Health Office to instruct the addiction treatment hospital to prepare to accommodate the opium offenders and force them to quit. The hospital originally had 190 beds, but due to the construction of the municipal hospital, some parts were demolished, leaving only 132 beds. If one bed is allocated per person, the hospital can only accommodate 132 people. The court will find other ways to increase the number of beds several times. The government hopes to eliminate opium in the city within six months. As for the towns and markets in the suburbs that are not within the jurisdiction of the municipal government, Jiangning County will handle them separately according to provincial regulations, which are not the same as those in the city of Beijing.

<p>Shao Yuanzhong Reports on Commemorative Significance</p>
<p>Commemorations Held Separately in Various Places</p>

Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Shao Yuanzhong reported, stating briefly: "The Zhaohe Uprising in Shanghai in the fourth year of the Republic of China was a heroic and great revolutionary movement of our party under the pressure of Yuan Shikai. Although this campaign failed, its significance, spirit, and impact on the future of the revolution were enormous. Therefore, the significance of our annual commemoration of the Zhaohe Uprising lies here. At that time, Yuan Shikai's power was very strong, and the power of the revolutionary party was almost incomparable. Those who blindly believed in force even supported Yuan Shikai's imperial system, shouting the slogan 'No one but Yuan can do it.' In this environment, revolutionary work was almost impossible to start, especially in Shanghai, where transportation was convenient and Yuan Shikai's troops were concentrated, there was no room for activity. Therefore, Mr. Chen Qimei, in order to awaken the revolutionary atmosphere that had subsided and to strike a blow to Yuan Shikai to dispel his illusion of force, was determined to [do what he knew was impossible] and with the spirit of [giving his all until his death], launched an uprising in Shanghai. Although it was not successful, its far-reaching significance and its great impact on the revolutionary cause, the heroic spirit of Mr. Chen Qimei and a part of the comrades he led, are worthy of our model. We should emulate the spirit of the comrades in the Zhaohe Uprising, strive to complete the revolutionary cause, and save the current crisis," and so on. The speech ended at 9:00 AM, and the meeting adjourned. (5th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Jiao Yitang Reads Sun Ke's Original Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a ceremony to commemorate the sixth anniversary of its establishment at 11:00 AM on the 5th. About 300 people, including all legislators and staff, attended, and foreign advisors such as Bada also participated. After Jiao Yitang led the ceremony, he read President Sun's report, the original text of which is as follows: "The Legislative Yuan was established at the beginning of the implementation of political tutelage, and it has been six years since then. Since I, Ke, took office, it has also been two years. A total of 84 general meetings have been held, and a total of 179 cases have been reviewed and passed, some revising old texts, some formulating new rules, and some completing previous unresolved matters. Roughly divided by category, there are 117 legislative bills, 50 budget bills, and 12 treaty bills, all of which have been shared with the people of the country. Others are still under review. Drafting the draft constitution of the Republic of China, waiting for the National Assembly to make the final decision, is the only mission of the colleagues in this session. I, Ke, deeply feel that the responsibility of legislation is great and heavy, and I dare not overstep my will. I have恪遵总理's will and followed the established rules of former President Hu, gathering the thoughts of all committee members, and only then have I been able to achieve this. Continuing on, from political tutelage to constitutionalism, there are myriad things to be handled. How can we ensure the realization of the spirit of the rule of law, bring the people into compliance with the rules, and establish national discipline? This depends on the unremitting efforts of future legislators,益懋 their achievements, and being diligent in their work." After reading, Jiao said: "The Legislative Yuan has enacted many laws in the past two years, such as drafting the constitution, revising the criminal law, and the county and city autonomy laws, all of which are the crystallization of the colleagues' painstaking efforts and loyalty to the country in the past two years. I sincerely hope that in the future, colleagues will continue to base themselves on new examples of legislation in the world, refer to the actual needs of the country, and complete various necessary laws and regulations, so that China can become a country with complete rule of law." Zhou Wei then gave a speech, stating briefly that the work of the Legislative Yuan in the past two years is not only worthy of the people of the country but can also be 자랑스럽게于 the world, such as the draft constitution created based on the Three Principles of the People, and Article 239 of the criminal law on adultery, which was formulated based on the principle of equality between men and women, are indeed a new highlight in world jurisprudence. Therefore, we should rejoice and celebrate at today's commemorative ceremony." Liang Hancao gave a speech, stating briefly that China's legislative work is very difficult. First, it must be based on the Three Principles of the People, and second, it must be suitable for the domestic situation. However, the 总理's principles are supreme, and China is vast and rich in resources. If there is no deep understanding of the principles and no full research on the national conditions, then the laws enacted will be difficult to implement. As for the spirit of the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan, being 公忠 for the country, it has been praised since former President Hu founded the court. I hope that we will pass on this spirit to the distant future and carry it forward." Finally, Huang Youchang and foreign advisor Bada and others gave speeches, praising the legislative achievements of the Legislative Yuan in recent years. Huang also recited his old poem made at the fourth anniversary ceremony in lieu of a speech. At 12:00 noon, the ceremony was completed, and the entire staff went to the East Garden for a photo before gathering for a meal. From 2:00 PM, various recreational activities were held, including drama, calligraphy, painting, riddles, and ball games. The program was wonderful, especially the 평粤剧 was the best. The entire court scene was quite peaceful, and all legislators and staff were beaming with joy. (5th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain legislator said that the term of the third legislative members will expire on January 11 next year. The fourth session will still be selected by the president and submitted to the central government for appointment, as in the past. Before President Sun went to Guangdong, he had mentioned that most of the members will be re-elected. As for the time to submit the appointment to the central government, it must be after the Fifth Plenary Session. There are 99 legislative members in this session, and the draft constitution stipulates 208 legislative members. It seems inappropriate to increase the number by one time before the constitution is promulgated. Therefore, the number of legislative members in the fourth session will be slightly increased, and the number will be increased to the number stipulated in the constitution after the implementation of constitutional government in the future.

<h3 id="e32">The Turnaround of German Diplomacy Heng <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Judging from recent foreign dispatches, German diplomacy has undergone a significant turnaround. For example, Hitler dispatched special envoy Ribbentrop to visit France to seek an understanding between Britain, France, and Germany. On the other hand, it also reached an agreement with France on the future redemption price of the Saar coal mines. It is still difficult to know what the final outcome of these two events will be. However, there is no doubt that it is sufficient to ease the current relationship between Germany and France and Britain and loosen the tense situation in Europe for a while. However, it is worth our attention why the German authorities, which have always regarded a tough foreign policy as a national policy, have made such a change.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's European telegram, the German situation is still quite precarious. The old grudges between the National Defense Forces and the Sturmabteilung and the Black Shirts have not been eliminated. Religious disputes are also likely to recur. In addition, a week ago, foreign telegrams even mentioned that the National Defense Forces were brewing a coup. Although there was no news after that, it can be seen from this that people's hearts are not at peace. Therefore, the turnaround of German diplomacy this time is definitely not without reason. As we see it, it seems to be prompted by internal difficulties.</p>
<p>Since the June 30th incident, Germany has been quiet on the surface, but the left-leaning elements within the National Socialist Party still exist. The hope of these people was originally to realize national socialism. However, since Mr. Hi Hi took office and was appointed as the sole head of state, the so-called national socialism has never been slightly realized. The left-leaning elements in the general party cannot but be greatly disappointed. Furthermore, since the establishment of Mr. Hi's regime, other political parties in Germany have been excluded. However, according to recent reports in the British and American newspapers, the secret activities of the Communist Party are underway again. Even in Mr. Hi's Sturmabteilung, there are many lurking reactionary forces. According to Mr. Keble, a key figure in the Hi Party, if the Sturmabteilung were to be disbanded, the communist disaster could be seen immediately. Those who are familiar with the German situation also mostly say that the reason why the German people do not show a unified opposition to Mr. Hi today is also because they are frightened by the thought of the communist disaster. This is the biggest internal problem in Germany today, and the way to eliminate it also depends on the improvement of international relations.</p>
<p>Hitler once said that if other countries continue to impose an economic blockade on Germany and do not sell raw materials to it, Germany can manufacture substitutes itself to resist. However, the manufacture of general substitutes is still far from reality. The more successful ones are kerosene and cotton. However, kerosene obtained from coal is very expensive. Cotton made from wood is of poor quality and easily damaged, and the price is also more expensive than cotton. Moreover, it can only be mixed with natural products such as wool and cotton and cannot completely replace wool and cotton. In addition, its production volume is less than 1% of the domestic cotton demand, which is still the rest. No matter how hard the Germans work, it is difficult to cope with the current emergency. This is another clear proof.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter this year, the German people have been competing to hoard food at home due to the lack of food in the country. As a result, prices have risen, which is different from normal times. The income tax law recently promulgated by the German government also taxes poor people with an annual income of 560 marks. With these several points, Germany's predicament has reached the point of [trying to make ends meet]. If international relations are not improved and the development of international trade is sought, the outbreak of a second revolution is also not easy to avoid.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the main reason for Germany's turnaround in diplomacy this time should be internal difficulties. However, the key to its success lies in the issue of equality in armaments and the issue of the Eastern European Convention. Whether these problems can be solved depends on whether France and Germany can abandon their past grievances.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Whether the London Naval Talks Will Continue is a Question <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Consider the Consequences of Japan's Abandonment of the Treaty</p>
<p>No Concrete Decisions at Previous Meetings</p>
<p>Britain Tries Again to Mediate for a Compromise</p>
<p>(London) The British and American delegations participating in the naval talks held a plenary meeting today to discuss the procedures that Britain and the United States should take after Japan cancels the Washington Treaty. The British representatives believed that Japan's abolition of this treaty does not necessarily mean the end of the current negotiations, while the American representatives believed that since the treaty has been abolished, the current talks will at least be temporarily suspended. No concrete decisions were made at today's meeting, because the opinions of both Britain and the United States have not yet crystallized. The US side feels that the Japanese representatives have slightly changed their resolute attitude in the past three days. The British and American delegations have made it clear that Japanese equality is out of the question, and the Japanese have also expressed their willingness to discuss the British compromise method on qualitative restrictions. It is expected that the American delegation will not return to the United States for its Christmas holidays. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira are scheduled to conduct naval negotiations again tomorrow. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, the British and American naval delegations held a plenary meeting to discuss purely procedural issues, that is, how the United Kingdom and the United States will deal with Japan's declaration of the abolition of the Washington Treaty. The Japanese side believes that the world has long known about the country's decision to abolish the Washington Treaty, and it will not directly affect the ongoing naval talks. American officials believe that if the Washington Treaty is formally declared abolished, the first stage of the naval talks will end. British officials believe that the talks must continue to be conducted in order to find a basis for a tripartite compromise, regardless of whether it is before or after the explicit abolition of the Naval Treaty. When the British and American representatives discussed today, they touched on the serious point of the naval issue, that is, what political impact will occur once the system stipulated in the Washington Treaty is abolished. Regarding this level, although the American side proposed a clear proposition, it ultimately believed that once the Washington Treaty is abolished, the Nine-Power Treaty cannot continue to exist. British officials said that the Nine-Power Treaty does not contain a clause declaring its abolition and can continue to exist. The British and American sides exchanged views on this point for a long time. Duman, an expert on the Far East issue of the British State Department, also attended and participated in today's meeting. This is something that has not been seen in the naval talks. In practical terms, no decisions were taken at today's meeting, but it is still hoped that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and Japan, can reach an agreement on procedural issues. The British delegation will serve as the host and engage in mediation, continuing to conduct talks with the representatives of the United States and Japan in order to establish a foundation and establish a new treaty to replace the Washington Treaty. It is particularly feared that the progress of the naval technical talks is not optimistic. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The British and American sides of the naval talks have completely different interpretations of Japan's true attitude. This is an important lesson learned in the talks. Since the start of the negotiations, Washington has always believed that the Japanese proposal is a plan set by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy after several deliberations. Therefore, there is actually no hope of softening the strong attitude of the Japanese government. The United Kingdom is not the case. British representatives have long believed that the Japanese proposal is its maximum asking price, and after several talks, concessions can be obtained. Therefore, the British side must make a final effort to extend the naval talks before the Washington Treaty is declared abolished. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British and American naval representatives talked twice yesterday, and their opinions were completely different. However, there is no doubt that the British representatives will take the opportunity to strongly argue to the American representatives the danger of starting to return home too early, and the American representatives will also strongly argue how the American public opinion cannot tolerate Japan's tough attitude, which is the same as what the Japanese representatives stated.

<h3 id="e35">Whether to Suspend the Meeting Depends on the UK <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, at the British-American meeting on the 4th regarding the question of continuing the preparatory consultations, the opinions expressed by the American representative Davis were as follows: 1. The United States takes the renewal of the nearly expired London Treaty as its main purpose, and also intends to consider separately if there is a need to amend the Washington Treaty. Therefore, it participates in the preparatory consultations. Now, Japan has decided to abandon the Washington Treaty, which has caused a major situation for the United States. 2. Under this new situation, whether the United States should start preparing for the 1935 meeting has a fundamental need for reconsideration. It is believed that it is advisable to temporarily suspend the consultations at least, but it cannot cause difficulties for the UK, the host country of the consultations. Therefore, the follow-up arrangements will be left to the discretion of Chairman MacDonald. 3. Even if the meeting is suspended, it is not a hindrance to reopen it in the future. The time and method will be left to the discretion of the chairman. The British side's stated policy of continuing the consultations is as follows: 1. The Japanese delegation argues that the notification of the abandonment of the Washington Treaty is the exercise of the treaty and does not directly hinder the progress of the consultations. The United Kingdom believes that this opinion needs to be considered. 2. The British and Japanese talks are discussing technical issues, and there is some possibility of agreement. At this time, it is difficult for the chairman to adopt it if the United States leaves the suspension of the consultations to the chairman. 3. Although the United Kingdom hopes to continue the consultations temporarily, it will not force it to continue if the United States believes it is impossible. 4. It is hoped that the above opinions will be told to Japan, and after listening to Japan's opinions, it will be decided whether the consultations should continue. (4th Dentsu dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Since the start of the preliminary naval talks, the opinions of the United States and Japan on the issue of naval ratios have been fundamentally divergent (Japan insists on naval equality, while the United States insists on maintaining the existing ratio). Although the naval delegations of the two countries have not explicitly admitted this, the fact is there and is obvious to everyone. Therefore, what procedures will be followed for future naval negotiations must be specified at present (referring to after the Washington Naval Treaty is declared abolished). This procedure can be divided into three levels in concrete terms: 1. Whether the 1935 naval conference should be convened. 2. If it is not appropriate to convene, then the three most relevant countries, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, should issue a declaration. 3. If it is appropriate to convene, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan solicit opinions from the naval countries, especially France and Italy, should the location and date of the future naval conference be determined?

<p>There is a Danger of Being Encroached Upon by the Japanese</p>
<p>Imports of Japanese Goods Increase Year by Year</p>
<p>American Goods Greatly Affected</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a report from the US Department of Commerce, the Philippine retail business was originally in the hands of overseas Chinese, and there is now a concern that it will be encroached upon by the Japanese. American goods are also greatly affected. In the past one or two years, the Japanese have set up their own retail stores in various parts of the Philippines. All store employees are Japanese and are very familiar with the local business situation. In 1933, the total value of all imports in the Philippines was 149,361,000 pesos, of which the United States received 87,571,000 pesos, accounting for about 60% of the total import trade. In 1932, the total import value of the Philippines was 159,790,000 pesos, and the United States received 102,983,000 pesos, accounting for about 65%. That is to say, the total import trade in 1933 was 60% lower than in 1932, and the import of American goods was less than 15%. Japanese goods originally ranked second. In 1933, 19,191,000 pesos were imported, accounting for 13% of the total import trade in the Philippines. In 1932, it was 12,310,000 pesos, accounting for about 7%. That is to say, the import of Japanese goods in 1933 was nearly 56% higher than in 1932. Japanese groceries are constantly flowing into the Philippines. (5th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Contains All Detailed Rules for Next Year's Vote</p>
<p>France and Germany Confirm Security Guarantees for Residents</p>
<p>And Stipulate Germany's Method of Repaying France</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Saar Committee has worked for several weeks to discuss the detailed rules for the Saar referendum, and has compiled a report, which was released here today and has attracted a lot of attention from the general public. The book comprehensively discusses the important issues of the Saar regime's delimitation of terms stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles, but the last paragraph states that the League of Nations may order a second referendum if necessary. The report mentions the issue of Saar nationality, saying that Saar residents can in fact obtain Saar nationality, but German nationals should be allowed to choose to enter German nationality. The book stipulates that the guarantees given to voters should be extended to residents who do not have the right to vote. French Foreign Minister Laval and German Foreign Minister Neurath exchanged letters, confirming this additional 保僮. The German government should pay the French government to compensate for the elimination of France's right of ownership of the Saar mining area. 95% of it can be paid with French paper money and other foreign currencies circulating in the Saar region, and the remainder can be paid with coal. It is heard that when Laval spoke with British Lord Privy Seal Eden, Chairman of the Saar Committee, and Italian Arossi, he hoped that the two would agree to British and Italian participation in any necessary military plans in the Saar region, even if dozens of people displayed the national flag, it would be acceptable. However, according to the opinions of people in the League of Nations, although British George and Italian Salatrani said this before, Eden and Arossi are unlikely to agree. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations released a committee report today, stating that German Foreign Minister Neurath and French Foreign Minister Laval promised that after the Saar vote for self-determination on January 13, they agreed not to retaliate against Saar residents, and that the property of those who do not vote will also be protected. The committee also recommended that the League of Nations should resolve that if the Saar is returned to Germany, foreign private investments in the territory should continue to be paid indefinitely until a solution is determined after Germany's economic situation deteriorates. Germany also promised to pay France 900 million francs in assets after the Saar is returned to Germany. (5th National Telegram)</p>

Regarding the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary over the Marseilles case, Poland has maintained a reserved attitude to this day and is unwilling to express any opinion. However, today's government newspaper [Polish Express] stated that the Marseilles case is being used to oppose Hungary, which is close to arbitrary. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Russia Wants Britain and America as Mediators for the Dispute</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch from the China United News Agency) Regarding the negotiations on the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it has been three months since Japan and Russia reached a general outline of the terms of sale in September. However, progress has stalled regarding the detailed terms such as the method of payment for the railway price and the selection of goods, and the future of the negotiations seems to be hopeless. The Japanese side attributes the reasons as follows: ㈠ Regarding the assessment of commodity prices and the selection of commodity types, the Soviet Union insists that in order to prevent disputes from occurring, a committee with the participation of a third country should be established at the time of the transaction to ensure a fair resolution of the dispute, and the third country should be Britain or the United States. At a time when relations between Japan and the puppet state of Manchuria and Russia are erratic, the Russian demands are also legitimate. However, the Japanese puppet state considers this a contemptuous condition. ㈡ The Soviet Union believes that after Japan abolishes the Washington Treaty, Japan's international status will be further isolated, and various countries will actively criticize Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty, and will demand the cancellation of Manchuria's open-door policy. At this time, if any agreement is concluded with the puppet state of Manchuria, it will not only be resented by Britain and the United States, but it is also not a good plan for the Soviet Union. ㈢ The establishment of the Franco-Russian military alliance allows the Soviet Union to have no worries in its western territories and can take a strong stance against Japan. ㈣ The above-mentioned various circumstances are all beneficial to Russia, so it does not want to conclude a deal unless its demands are thoroughly implemented.</p>

<p>United States Expresses Willingness to Participate</p>
<p>Subsidies and Wars Devastate Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Urgently Seek Relief</p>
<p>(London) British Secretary of Commerce Runciman announced today that a preliminary world shipping conference will be held in London in early January next year to draft an agenda for a formal conference to be held in Berlin. It is learned that Runciman has received a notification from the State Department in Washington, indicating that the United States is also willing to participate. The world shipping industry has long been devastated by the current [subsidy war], and Britain and the United States have been seeking relief. The U.S. Senate has sent personnel to investigate the current status of these subsidies in order to determine whether they should be increased or decreased in the future. Britain has suffered great failures in maritime transport in recent years. In 1896, British steamship tonnage accounted for 56% of the world's total, but today it has fallen to just over 28%. Shipping countries, large and small, are doing their best to build ships, unaware that the number of ships in the world far exceeds transportation needs. As for why countries are competing in this way, it may be because merchant ships are the most valuable auxiliary force for the navy. The way to provide relief may be to use the recommendations of League of Nations transportation experts as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Limit the capacity and speed of merchant ships.</p>
<p>㈡ Ships of 8,000 to 10,000 tons that are more than twenty years old should be scrapped.</p>
<p>㈢ Establish an international shipping agency with the power to control navigation and shipbuilding plans.</p>
<p>㈣ Temporarily suspend the navigation of tramp steamers (i.e., so-called "wild chicken boats").</p>
<p>㈤ Organize an international shipping association to cooperate with the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Runciman also stated that Japanese ships have taken away some British and American business by using their low freight rates, so efforts will now be made to ensure that Japan actively participates in this type of world conference. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Shipping Mail Investigation Committee today confirmed here that the expenses of Japanese cargo ships are 54% lower than those of American cargo ships, because the wages, food, repairs, etc. of Japanese cargo ships are the lowest in the world. Therefore, if the government can continue to subsidize American commerce in the Pacific, it can be increased. However, American shipping representatives could not answer why the speed of Japanese cargo ships is higher than that of American ships. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

The Far East manager of Lloyd Company is already in Kobe preparing everything.

<h3 id="e54">Reichstag Fire Case <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>French Newspapers Publish a Shocking Document</p>
<p>Proving Goebbels and Göring Conspired</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's Paris Daily publishes a shocking document with the handwritten signature of the late Berlin Stormtroopers Commander Ernst and countersigned by two people. It was addressed to Dr. Brandigt of Sweden. Ernst stated that it should not be published unless he died violently. The document proves that Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Prussian Prime Minister Göring were both accomplices in the burning of the Reichstag on February 27 of this year. The document cleared Hitler of everything, saying that he was completely unaware. The gist of the document is that the Stormtroopers initially discussed with Generals Goebbels and Göring to pretend that the Communists were plotting to assassinate the Prime Minister in order to damage the reputation of the Communist Party and consolidate the power of the National Defense Party. This plan was not implemented because everyone advocated setting fire to the Reichstag. Göring supplied flammable materials such as nitrate and sulfur. He (Ernst) carried them through the tunnel of the Prussian Prime Minister's Office to the Great Hall of the Reichstag and placed them in the hall, which spontaneously burned half an hour later. As for the Dutchman Lubbe, who was later sentenced to death in this case, he was weak-willed. Although he believed he was acting alone, he was actually used to cover up other people's ears and eyes. It was agreed at the time that half an hour after the Stormtroopers serving in the Reichstag withdrew, Lubbe would set fire in the Reichstag's auditorium. After the Reichstag fire, Lubbe and five others were arrested and charged with arson. This case caused worldwide shock. The Leipzig Higher Court interrogated the case for a long time and sentenced Lubbe to death on December 3, 1933, and acquitted the other four. Lubbe was executed on January 10 of this year. During the purge movement in June of this year, Hitler accused Ernst of disloyalty to the party, and he and many other Stormtroopers leaders were shot. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Discussing the Indian Constitutional Reform Bill</p>
<p>(London) The National Conservative Party Organization held a special meeting today at Queen's Hall to discuss the report on Indian constitutional reform proposed by the Joint Committee. Conservative Party leader Baldwin had promised to consult with the Conservative Party Executive Committee before the government submitted a bill on Indian autonomy based on the report. Baldwin delivered a speech at the opening of the meeting, strongly urging the members to pass the report, saying that if the Parliament overturned this suggestion, and if India became an election battlefield between the Socialist Party and the Conservatives who opposed the bill, he could not bear to say what would happen in India. If you refuse to give India this opportunity, then no matter what you do, you will lose India within two generations. Then, former Sea Minister Amery moved to support the principles contained in the report. Then, Lord Salisbury, representing the progressive faction of the Conservative Party, proposed an amendment, saying that he was prepared to accept a provincial autonomy plan that had been carefully considered and guaranteed India's appropriate governance, but he earnestly hoped that Parliament would not take resolute steps and build an Indian central responsible government based on the recommendations of the report. The section on security in the report looks very satisfactory on paper, but has no real power. Once power is relinquished, once the Indians establish a central organization, there will be no retreat. Churchill supported Sha's amendment, saying that the current situation is critical and cannot throw a large eastern territory into the furnace again. Churchill continued to mention the report, asking whether the result of seven years of hesitation and doubt can satisfy everyone. The Socialist Party will only use this as a stepping stone for a violent path, and the Indian Congress Party will only use this as an axis for their purposes. What are other countries doing with their huge overseas territories? France and the Netherlands, both allies of Britain, are all shocked by Britain's attitude towards India. What will Germany do? What will Japan do? Germany is planning to restore its lost territories, and Japan is practicing imperialism, while Great Britain seems to be tricked into losing its territories. Churchill's speech won applause from the entire venue, but the vote proved that the excitement of Churchill's speech only emphasized the eloquence of his speech, not the emotions expressed in his speech. The 79-year-old Lord Fetcherland also rose to speak in support of Churchill's opinion. After the debate was over, Sha Lisibao's amendment was put to a vote, and 2,000 representatives raised their hands to express their opposition, so it was rejected. All the representatives who attended the meeting today admitted that this debate is not only related to the future of India, but also to British politics. If Sha won, it would lead to party strife, and it is feared that it would also cause other repercussions. (Dispatch from Dentu, 4th)</p>

<p>Authorizing the Minister of Economic Affairs with Dictatorial Power Over Capital</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Cabinet today passed several economic laws to tighten the control of Minister of Economic Affairs Hjalmar Schacht over Germany's capital resources. Schacht has now become Germany's capital dictator. One of the most important new laws limits all business dividends to no more than six percent. If there is a surplus, it must be deposited in cash in the discount bank as a loan. This reserve must be used for domestic relief and construction and cannot be withdrawn within four years. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Cabinet meeting recently passed several important financial and economic bills: ㈠ Revised the current regulations on the securities market and the financial market, stipulating the establishment of a control bureau to manage national banks and trust institutions. From now on, all securities interest may not exceed 6%. Any amount exceeding this number will be included in the government bond fund. In other words, although this fund should be returned to the original owner after four years in the regulations, in practice, the government will withdraw the net profit from industry and commerce within four years. ㈡ Stipulates that the copyright enjoyed by writers, musicians, and sculptors, originally set at 30 years, is extended to 50 years. ㈢ Stipulates the state's control over the prices of daily necessities, which also applies to the prices of industrial products. In addition, the government has decided to cut 12 securities exchanges, allowing only four to continue operating. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>US Navy and Air Force Search Without Success</p>
<p>◎ Honolulu: Famous Australian aviator Ulm and his assistant Little John were forced to land in the Pacific Ocean due to lack of gasoline and loss of control. Today, dozens of steamships and planes set out to investigate. Twenty naval planes are now systematically searching in all directions. Nine submarines, destroyers, and twenty torpedo boats spread out like a fan, sweeping to 250 miles northeast of Honolulu. Cargo ships and postal ships also sailed out of their routes, following Ulm's route to search for traces. Coast Guard ships also set off from Hilo and Honolulu this morning, searching south. Ulm and Little John originally planned to fly from Auckland to Sydney, but disappeared in the first section. This morning at 9:24, the two sent a distress short message, saying that they had been forced to land on the ocean surface and were urgently awaiting rescue. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>◎ San Francisco: It is learned that this accident of famous Australian aviator Ulm is not the first time. It is still remembered that in 1929, when Ulm and Kingsford Smith flew from Sydney to London, they were forced to land and survived for 12 days on wild grass and fruits. They were finally rescued when they reached a village. They are now drifting on the ocean surface, and their situation is even more dangerous. There is now generally no hope of survival.

<p>▲ New York: Before the opening of the securities market, the factors favoring the market conditions were: 1. The market conditions for various government bonds were firm, and the prices of railway stocks have exceeded the height of October, which is exciting and has the effect of boosting market popularity. It is expected that the buying trend will continue to develop. 2. Many companies are issuing special dividends, which shows that business has improved and creates demand for speculators and investors. The unfavorable factor for the market conditions is the expectation that the next Congress may propose several expansion bills. Although it is believed that the authorities are capable of canceling them, people in the market cannot avoid being wary of this. This morning, the securities market opened with relatively active trading and little price fluctuation, but the trend was mostly upward. Merchants still maintain a cautious attitude. However, railway stocks have been purchased recently, which can be regarded as a very constructive thing. Judging from the market situation, market prices will continue to rise. The rebound trend of yesterday seems to have slightly expanded today.</p>

<p>(Tianjin dispatch) There is a shortage of silver dollars within the puppet state. The currency of the puppet state is not trusted by the people.

The treacherous merchants in eastern Luan secretly transport it to profit, resulting in an extreme shortage of cash in various cities and towns. On the 3rd, the Tangshan Baocheng Silver House secretly transported 6,000 yuan into the puppet state. It was discovered and detained by customs when it passed through Yuguan.

In recent days, they have visited Xu Yongchang, Zhao Daiwen, Jia Jingde, and various friends.

The area under the jurisdiction of Jing Yuexiu in northern Shaanxi has a total of 15 counties. A report on political affairs has been prepared and submitted to the Shaanxi Provincial Government for review. In terms of finance, due to consecutive years of drought and heavy taxes, the people have reached the extreme of poverty. The provincial government has now dispatched special commissioners to start reorganization. Communist bandits are taking advantage of the opportunity to unite with opium bandits and others to rob and plunder. After intensive suppression, they have been divided into fragments. A part of them has fled to Gansu. Officials and civilians in Shaanxi are determined to carry out suppression. This year, they will start with banning cultivation.

<h3 id="e106">Hebei Provincial Government to Move Back to Baoding Within the Year <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Government Headquarters Selected as the Cao Family Garden</p>
<p>Joint Office Work to Begin After the Move to Baoding</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: The issue of the Hebei Provincial Government moving to Baoding has been largely decided to be implemented on New Year's Day next year. Joint office work will also be implemented on the same day. The abolishment of bureaus and merger of sections in various counties under its jurisdiction was decided at the previous administrative conference convened by the Hebei Provincial Government to be implemented on New Year's Day next year. Except for the Public Security Bureau, whose name will remain unchanged to take special responsibility, the rest will be changed to sections. Regarding the Finance Bureau, it has been decided to be uniformly called the Second Section. The various details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Motivation for Moving to Baoding <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The idea of the Hebei Provincial Government moving to Baoding has been brewing for a long time. Baoding was formerly the capital of Zhili Province and one of the important towns in North China. At that time, the prosperity of Baoding surpassed that of other provincial capitals. Later, due to changing times and circumstances, it was moved to Tianjin and then to Beiping, and then back to Tianjin. Recently, the authorities have considered that Hebei Province has become the forefront of national defense. For the sake of convenient control, it seems more appropriate to move back to Baoding. Moreover, Baoding is located in the center of Hebei Province, backed by heavy mountains in the west and converging rivers in the east, guarding the throat of Shanxi and controlling the key to Shandong and Henan. Its importance is evident. Huang Fu, the Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, after returning to office from the north a few days ago, in addition to summoning Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei to discuss the matter, also telegraphed the central government to suggest it. The residents of Baoding were deeply supportive of this idea and encouraged and welcomed it. Since the province was moved, the market conditions in Baoding have been declining to the extreme. If the provincial government can move back, prosperity can be expected and the local economy can be revived. Therefore, the people of the area wish for the Hebei Provincial Government to move back to Baoding. Before the reorganization of the Hebei Provincial Government, the Cao Family Garden in Baoding had already started repairs in preparation for its application at that time, and it was decided to prepare for the move after the executive Yuan's regular meeting passed the proposal. According to reliable sources, the Hebei Provincial Government will work in Baoding from New Year's Day next year. In any case, the move will begin within the year, with the goal of completing the move before the New Year.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Joint Office Work <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government has long been prepared for joint office work. In addition to sending personnel to various provinces that have already implemented joint office work for inspection and as a reference, Chairman Yu Xuezhong personally inspected the results of joint office work in the two provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei when he went to Ganzhou and Wuhan to visit Jiang and Zhang. After returning to Tianjin, he ordered the various departments to propose measures. Later, due to the small size of the government building in Tianjin, it could not be realized immediately, so it was temporarily shelved. Since the province had the brewing of moving to Baoding, Yu sent personnel to Baoding to survey and find a government building for use. The Cao Family Garden was selected, and workers were sent to repair it. The garden was built by Cao Kun when he was stationed in Baoding. The garden is vast and there are many houses, which is very suitable for the joint office work of various departments. The joint office work measures can also be submitted for discussion and voting at the provincial government's regular meeting in the short term. Its realization period is now set for New Year's Day next year, and it is unlikely to change.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Abolishment of Bureaus in Various Counties <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The finances of Hebei Province have been stretched and extremely difficult for the past three years due to various losses from disaster relief. Since the central government decided to abolish miscellaneous taxes, it has felt increasingly unable to sustain itself. The compensation given by the central government is limited in number. If it is not remedied by further austerity measures, there is no complete solution. At the previous administrative conference, it was resolved that county governments should uniformly abolish bureaus and merge sections to save public funds. The Hebei Provincial Government and various departments were to issue orders to their subordinate county bureaus to prepare for completion within this year and implement them uniformly from New Year's Day next year. However, because the public security bureaus in various counties are responsible for maintaining public order, the public security bureaus will retain their names in order to facilitate administration. All other bureaus will be uniformly called sections. The Finance Bureau will be renamed the Second Section. The section chiefs will go to the county government to work on time every day. With this method, the county government's operating expenses can be saved by about one-third, and its administrative efficiency will be better than submitting documents back and forth. (4th)</p>

<p>Provincial and Municipal Governments Host Welcome Banquet</p>
<p>British Envoy to Stay in Guangdong for Three Days Before Going to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: British Minister to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, went south a few days ago to inspect British expatriates in various ports in South China. He arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of November 22 aboard the HMS "Mauritius".</p>
<p>The military and political authorities of Guangdong Province sent representatives to board the ship to welcome him. Because Knatchbull-Hugessen was tired from the voyage, he decided to go ashore the next day. Only the British Consul General in Guangdong, Mr. Philip, disembarked that day for a private meeting with Knatchbull-Hugessen. At 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd, Knatchbull-Hugessen, accompanied by Counselor Bielese and British Consul General Philip, took a car from Shamian to formally visit Governor Lin Yun'gai of Guangdong Province. In advance, in addition to sending personnel to Shamian to receive him, the Provincial Government also sent police detectives to protect him along the way. In front of the Provincial Government, guards of honor and a Western orchestra were arranged. Governor Lin Yun'gai was waiting at the second gate of the Provincial Government. When Knatchbull-Hugessen arrived, the ceremony was performed. The national anthems of China and Britain were played alternately. After the music stopped, Governor Lin accompanied Knatchbull-Hugessen to inspect the guards of honor for a week, and then held a meeting in the Western-style flower hall, where they talked to each other for about 20 minutes. Knatchbull-Hugessen then bid farewell and went to the Guangzhou Municipal Government to visit Mayor Liu Jiwen. He arrived at the Municipal Government at 10:30 a.m., met with Liu for a while, and then returned to the British Concession in Shamian for rest. At 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, Governor Lin Yun'gai of the Provincial Government went to the British Consulate in Shamian to return Knatchbull-Hugessen's visit. At 3:30 p.m., Mayor Liu Jiwen also arrived to return the visit. At 7:00 p.m., the Provincial Government hosted a banquet to entertain them, which was attended by Governor Lin Yun'gai, military and political figures such as Chen Jitang, and the heads of various departments of the Provincial Government. Foreign guests included Envoy Xu, Knatchbull-Hugessen, his wife Lady Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Counselor Bielese, British Consul General Philip, and Consul Huan Daer. During the banquet, Governor Lin delivered a speech, saying that his colleagues were honored by Knatchbull-Hugessen's visit to the province. The diplomatic relations between China and Britain have always been cordial, and Hong Kong and Guangzhou are particularly close in history and geography. Now that Your Excellency has come south, we have been able to receive valuable advice. We believe that the friendship between China and Britain will be further enhanced. After the speech, he raised his glass to Knatchbull-Hugessen and his wife, and wished the United Kingdom a prosperous future. Then Knatchbull-Hugessen stood up to respond and left happily at about 9:00 p.m. On the morning of the 24th, Knatchbull-Hugessen and the British Consul General and others visited famous scenic spots in Guangzhou and visited new construction projects. The provincial and municipal governments sent special commissioners to guide the tour, including the Haizhu Iron Bridge, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the Tomb of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang, the Henan Silk Weaving Factory, and the Xicun Cement Factory. They returned at about 12:00 p.m. At 8:00 p.m. that evening, the Municipal Government held a banquet to welcome Knatchbull-Hugessen, which was attended by the consuls of Germany, the United States, Norway, and Denmark stationed in Guangzhou, as well as the Postal Commissioner and the Tax Commissioner. During the banquet, Mayor Liu Jiwen delivered a welcome speech, saying that Guangzhou was the earliest port for trade. Among the cities in China, it has a close relationship with Britain's commerce in the Far East. For example, the distance between Guangdong and Hong Kong is only more than 300 li, and it takes only one day to travel from morning to evening. The distance from Singapore is only six or seven days by water. Business is closely related. Many British people operate or reside in Guangzhou. Chinese and British people have always had harmonious and cooperative feelings, so the diplomatic relations between China and Britain are becoming increasingly close. This is something we are pleased to see. We hope that this phenomenon will be maintained forever by the Chinese and British people. We are most honored to be able to gather together with Your Excellency this time, and we ask you to join us in raising a glass to the friendship between China and Britain. After the speech, Knatchbull-Hugessen returned the courtesy and then shook hands and bid farewell. At 10:00 a.m. on the 25th, the Municipal Government sent personnel to accompany Knatchbull-Hugessen and others to visit the Huangpodong scenic spot and the new campus of Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai. They returned to Shamian in the afternoon. Knatchbull-Hugessen dined at the British Consulate, and then left Guangzhou on the original ship at 6:00 p.m. that afternoon, heading to Hong Kong for a short stay before returning north.

<p>The Entire Province Displays Joyful Scenes</p>
<p>Nanchang Citizens Parade with Lanterns</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Jiangxi Province, from the 16th year of the Republic [1927] to the present, has groaned under the terror of the Reds for a total of eight years. During the era of rampant Communist bandits, among the eighty-one counties, the truly safe areas numbered no more than four or five. The various forces of Zhu [De], Mao [Zedong], Peng [Dehuai], Lin [Biao], and Luo [Ronghuan] had three times spied on Nanchang, twice reaching the West Mountains area near the city suburbs. The situation was precarious. Now, having stepped onto the broad road to recovery, the delight and jubilation are naturally a unanimous expression throughout the province, as Jiangxi, with the Central Government and Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] devoting their full efforts to post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, will have all construction efforts centered on it, becoming a model. Misfortune may be a blessing in disguise; finding a cure through illness. This is what the people of Jiangxi privately rejoice in. Therefore, after Ruijin and Huichang were captured, and the provincial territory was restored to its complete and unbroken state, the Preparatory Office of Various Circles for Comforting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Comforting the 剿匪 [Communist Suppression] Soldiers, Wounded and Sick Officers and Soldiers, and Compatriots in the Recovered Areas, initiated a large-scale celebration. Since the 30th of last month, Party and national flags have fluttered and danced throughout the city, and every household has been decorated with colorful red lanterns, creating a brilliant scene of peace and prosperity. On the 1st of this month, a celebration and comforting rally was held in Yuzhang Park, attended by over 1,800 representatives from various circles. It was also resolved to raise donations to establish a 剿匪 [Communist Suppression] Memorial Hall, and to petition the Central Government to allocate funds to establish a Disabled Soldiers' Factory, among five proposals. After the meeting, entertainment was held at the Changxin Grand Theater to share the joy. The 3rd was the last day of the celebration. Around 4 p.m. in the evening, a lantern parade was held at the public stadium. More than 10,000 people from various organs and groups participated in the parade in organized teams with lanterns. Starting at 5 p.m., all the lanterns, in order to comply with the principles of the New Life Movement, sought beauty in simplicity. The lanterns of the provincial government and departments were all oval-shaped and white, extremely clean and tidy. The lanterns of the provincial party headquarters were in the shape of a shield, containing a sense of self-defense. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau had lanterns depicting figures playing drums and blowing trumpets, showing the intention of joyful encouragement, preceded by lanterns with the heads of Zhu [De] and Mao [Zedong], as a sign of the capture and beheading of Zhu and Mao. Other examples included the "Capture of Red Bandits" lantern of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall, the automobile lanterns of the Transportation Corps, costumed propaganda, and the colorful displays of various industries, businesses, schools, and other sectors, all striving for novelty and beauty while still adhering to the principles of simplicity and plainness. The lantern procession passed through Huanhu Road North, through Zhangshuxia, past Yuzhang Park, into Desheng Road, turned onto Zhongshan Road, and circled back to Huanhu Road to return to the stadium. The procession was orderly, and the spectators along the way were like walls. It only dispersed at 8 p.m. In addition, the five proposals passed by the Celebration and Comforting Rally of Various Circles have been telegraphed: (1) Telegram to Nanjing to comfort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; (2) Telegram to military hospitals throughout the country to comfort the wounded officers and soldiers who were suppressed by the Red Army; (3) Telegram to Ruijin, Huichang, Shicheng, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Guangchang to comfort the compatriots in the recovered areas; (4) Telegram to Beijing to support the Fifth Plenary Session; (5) Telegram to various places and circles to request donations to relieve refugees in bandit-stricken areas.

<h3 id="e112">Anhui Rice Exports Suffer <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>|No Transactions in Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Yantai, or Ningbo|</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Wuhu is the area where rice and grain from southern Anhui converge. The annual exports are nearly ten million shi [a unit of dry measure]. There are more than 200 rice businesses in the whole port, roughly divided into three categories: rice firms, rice shops, and rice mills. Rice shops are those that buy and sell on behalf of customers, transfer and export, and collect commissions, as well as collect rice and grain on their own for transportation and sale to other places. Rice firms are divided into four gangs: Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo. They specialize in buying bulk quantities from rice mills and rice shops and transporting them to Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Yantai, Ningbo and other places. Rice mills sell rice that they hull themselves locally, or supply it to the people for food. According to statistics, the value of rice and grain exported from Wuhu each year reaches 10 million yuan. This year, since the provincial government promulgated the method of requisitioning grain for disaster relief, the rice market has been even more depressed. The Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo gangs have had hardly any transactions to speak of. As for rice mills and rice shops, they only have sporadic transactions. Recently, the market price for the best quality is nine yuan seven or eight jiao [monetary unit] per shi, and the secondary quality is eight yuan eight or nine jiao, which is more than three yuan per shi higher than two months ago. In addition, Wuhu produces the most glutinous rice, about 50,000 shi per year, followed by Nanling and Xuancheng, about 30,000 shi per year. Sales are also large in Yantai, Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Chaozhou. However, according to statistics from relevant authorities, this year's exports have been greatly reduced. Miscellaneous grains such as wheat and barley were originally mostly produced in northern Anhui, and Anqing also produced a lot. The annual production in counties near Wuhu is only about 160,000 to 170,000 shi. In addition to supplying the local Yixin Flour Mill, most of it is transported and sold to Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan and other places. Rapeseed is also a major commodity among the miscellaneous grains produced in southern Anhui. Xuancheng, Wuhu, Wuwei, Hexian, Hanshan, Nanling, and Dangtu account for no less than one million shi. Hundreds of thousands of shi are transshipped from Wuhu to Shanghai every year, mostly bought by Japan. (4th)</p>

<p>Around midnight on the 4th, a fire suddenly broke out in the wood shed behind the Taihetang Pharmacy near the North Gate Intersection in the city. In an instant, it burst through the roof, and the firelight illuminated the sky. Drums were immediately sounded to call for help. Fire brigades rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm to pour water and extinguish the fire. Magistrate Yuan also led the security team and the entire Public Security Bureau to the scene to supervise the rescue and maintain order. However, since the location was in the city streets, it was difficult to fetch water for firefighting, and the shops and houses were closely connected, so there was a tendency for the fire to spread rapidly. Fortunately, the firefighters bravely dismantled the buildings of Guangfumao Grocery Store and Sanjin Socks Factory on both sides of the pharmacy, which allowed the fire to be extinguished. However, the pharmacy building was completely burned down, and the facade of Renji Sauce Garden on the opposite side was also scorched. Fortunately, it did not spread. The total loss of the stores is estimated to be about five to six thousand taels of silver.</p>

However, Zhiyi had a weakness for women.巧鳳 Qiao Feng, Yu Xilin's niece (20 years old), had some beauty and was awaiting marriage. Chen fell in love at first sight and seduced her.

Zhiyi then instigated her to go to Chen's house in Yangxiang to have an abortion. Because the medicine was strong, her lower body was injured, causing her extreme pain and moaning. The situation was quite critical. Zhiyi knew that things were bad, so he secretly hired a boat to send Qiao Feng to Yu's house. She died of her ailments at noon the day before yesterday.

<p>The Jiangyin Branch of the Zhenjiang Customs has been ordered to be upgraded to a place for loading and unloading passengers and cargo. Yesterday, Superintendent Jia Guilin and Customs Commissioner Zhang Boli issued a proclamation to Chinese and foreign merchants and various shipping companies. All matters concerning the three marine vessels entering the Yangtze River under the management of the Branch Customs will still be handled in accordance with the regulations, without any changes. The steamships that regularly travel the Yangtze River will be allowed to load and unload passengers and cargo in Jiangyin in accordance with the regulations for places where passengers and cargo are loaded and unloaded. As for the steamships coming from domestic coastal areas and from overseas to China, if they want to sail to Jiangyin for trade, they must first sail to the first treaty port, report to the customs there, and obtain a special permit to sail to the inner port of Jiangyin. They must also list the foreign goods carried in the ship, have them checked by the customs, and pay the taxes there before reporting to the Wusong Branch Customs and obtaining permission to enter the Yangtze River before they can sail to Jiangyin. In the future, when leaving Jiangyin, they must still sail back to the original port in accordance with the regulations for ships sailing in the inner port and return the inner port special permit. If domestic goods are transported from Jiangyin to overseas, they should first report to the branch customs office there. Within the scope that is possible, the branch customs office will send personnel to inspect it. However, the export tax should be paid to the customs office that issued the inner port special permit. If domestic goods are transported from Jiangyin to a treaty port by an inner port steamship, or from a treaty port to Jiangyin, they will be exempt from transit tax. As for sailing to the Wusong Branch Customs, because it is stipulated in the Yangtze River navigation regulations and must be reported to the branch customs, the domestic goods it carries will also not be subject to transit tax.</p>

<p>This county has suffered a long drought this year, and the autumn harvest is less than 40%.

However, the cause of death, according to general speculation, was probably that he was killed for adultery. Because Prosecutor Meng could not find any relatives of the deceased, he ordered the policeman to collect the body and ordered the arrest of the murderer.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Shanghai Representatives Commemorated the Zhaohe Uprising Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Seamen's Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Both Reported the Significance of the Commemoration</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: At 10 a.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters convened people from all walks of life in the auditorium to hold a memorial meeting for the Zhaohe Uprising. Tong Xingbai, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, presided over the meeting, reported the course of the uprising, and its significance. The meeting then ended with the shouting of slogans. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Representatives Participating in the Municipal Party Headquarters <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xiupu of the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, Gu Caijiang of the Seventh District Sanitation Industry Union, Gao Jie of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, Wang Longzhang of the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Yu Zhenhui of the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, Yu Yuanru of the Sixth District Tea Manufacturing Union, Yu Yaoqiu of the Dry Goods Union, Ma Hanfeng of the Labor Education Committee, Long Peiyun of the General Labor Union, Ren Bin of the Bone and Ivory Utensil Union, Liu Yongkang of the Pharmaceutical Industry Professional Union, He Yuanming of the Accountants' Association, and all staff of the Municipal Party Headquarters, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the ceremony, Chairman Tong Xingbai reported that after the Revolution of 1911, Yuan Shikai monopolized power. Some comrades of our party were induced by profit and fame to seek promotion and fortune, but most still adhered to their revolutionary spirit and did not collude with Yuan. After the Second Revolution, Yuan's massacre of party members became even more intensified. However, the comrades of our party, although unable to gain a foothold in the country, still worked hard overseas to make revolution, taking the opportunity to return home to fight to the death with the counter-revolutionary forces. In 1915, Premier Sun Yat-sen led all revolutionary comrades to plan to overthrow Yuan. Premier Sun then ordered Mr. Chen Qimei to return home to take charge of everything. At that time, Yuan's henchman Zheng Ruicheng led a large army to garrison Shanghai and also controlled the navy. Therefore, Mr. Chen Qimei believed that it would be difficult to launch an uprising unless Zheng was removed. He then sent a comrade to assassinate Zheng at the Baidu Bridge. After Zheng's death, Yuan sent Yang Shanduo to be the Songhu Military Governor. Mr. Chen Qimei then sent Comrade Yang Hu to mobilize the army and navy to launch an uprising. Given the weakness of the revolutionary forces and the difficulty of the economy at the time, the fact that more than 20 people occupied Zhaohe is worthy of admiration. Therefore, although it failed, it was a very glorious event in revolutionary history. We have two feelings when commemorating the Zhaohe Uprising today: (1) The Zhaohe Uprising was to fight to the death with the traitors of the Republic of China created by our party, regardless of all sacrifices and going forward courageously. Therefore, we should still maintain this spirit today to eliminate the traitors who are destroying the Republic of China. These traitors are today's Red bandits. (2) We should unite sincerely and work together to revive China. The comrades at that time, although weak in strength and facing difficult circumstances, loved the Republic of China so much. We should strive today so as not to betray the martyrs.</p>
<p>Commemorative Slogans: (1) The Zhaohe Uprising is the key to the revival of the Republic of China; (2) The Zhaohe Uprising is the prelude to the Yunnan Uprising; (3) Eliminate the Red bandits; (4) Strive for production and construction; (5) Long live the Kuomintang; (6) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Seamen's Party Headquarters <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Seamen held a memorial meeting for the 19th anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising at 9 a.m. yesterday (the 5th) in the auditorium of the Party Headquarters. All members, staff, and representatives of various seamen's organizations of the Shanghai District Party Headquarters participated. After the ceremony, Secretary Chen Songping, the chairman, reported that the adverse domestic and international political environment of 1915 was first described. The spirit of the martyred martyrs and Mr. Yang Hu, who sacrificed themselves for the party and the country, was admirable. Then, the significance of the Zhaohe Uprising was expounded: one was to eliminate autocracy, revive the Republic of China, and open up the light of China's political history; one was to overthrow Yuan and resist the violent Japanese, crush the legal basis of the Twenty-One Demands, and keep the Chinese flag alive without being cut off. Finally, all the seamen were encouraged to follow the bloody footprints of the martyrs of the Zhaohe Uprising, inherit the pioneering road of the advanced members of the Party, work hard to eliminate the Red bandits, stabilize society, increase production, and relieve the national crisis, so that China can be elevated to the realm of the Three Principles of the People. Then, the seamen's representatives delivered speeches and shouted slogans. The meeting ended at 11 a.m. At the same time, a letter to the seamen was distributed in commemoration of the 19th anniversary of the Zhaohe warship uprising, saying: Dear seamen comrades, the wheels of the times are constantly moving forward. In a flash, the 19th anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising, which frightened Yuan Shikai to death and revived the Republic of China, has arrived. This revolutionary act, which will be recorded in history, is worthy of our enthusiastic commemoration. After the Revolution of 1911 was completed and Premier Sun Yat-sen took office as President, it was originally hoped that the people would be of one mind, lay out new policies, and seek infinite happiness for the country and the nation. However, at that time, party members with weak wills were either confused by the words of ["the revolutionary army rises, the revolutionary party disappears"] or indulged in the idea of climbing dragons and clinging to phoenixes in order to seize profits and benefits. They betrayed Premier Sun Yat-sen and supported Yuan. This led to the shaking of the revolutionary front of the Party, and the great plan of national construction could not be realized. Premier Sun Yat-sen always held the spirit of ["Better to be a broken jade than a whole tile"]. Seeing this situation, he resigned. The power then fell into the hands of Yuan. Yuan was a treacherous and evil villain with different ambitions. Once he monopolized power, he excluded dissidents, widely planted minions, and hoped to realize his dream of becoming an emperor. He then proceeded to borrow heavily from the five countries, bribing members and spies, destroying the Provisional Constitution, colluding with Japan, and even frantically recognizing the Twenty-One Demands that would destroy the country, causing the lifeline of the country to be on the verge of collapse. At that time, Premier Sun Yat-sen was in Japan. Upon hearing the news, he was filled with grief and anger. He deeply knew that the work of overthrowing Yuan and protecting the country could no longer be delayed. Therefore, he sent comrades such as Ju Zheng and Zhu Zhixin to Shandong, Guangdong, and other places to carry out activities. At the same time, he believed that Shanghai was the throat of the Yangtze River and the hub of the north and south. If it could be occupied, Jiangbiao would certainly fall at the mere sight of it. Therefore, he sent Chen Qimei, Yang Hu, and other comrades to take charge of the work in Shanghai. Yuan also realized the agitation of the Party against the imperial system and was eager to find ways to defend it. He was especially afraid of the activists led by Chen Qimei and others. Therefore, he sent his capable henchman Zheng Ruicheng to garrison Shanghai with a large army and strictly guarded it. Comrade Chen Qimei knew that Shanghai would not be easily launched unless Zheng was removed. Therefore, he sent comrades Wang Mingshan and Wang Xiaofeng, who were proficient in shooting, to kill him on the side of the Baidu Bridge. After Zheng Ruicheng, whom Yuan relied on as the Great Wall, died, Comrade Chen Qimei took advantage of the popular sentiment and the unsettled deployment of Yuan to send Comrade Yang Hu on December 5 to lead a death squad to seize the Zhaohe warship and formally launch a campaign against Yuan. Comrade Yang Hu also announced the Party's aims and the purpose of the Yuan campaign to the Marine Corps. All were happy to accept command and fired cannons at the Yuan army in the arsenal. Comrades on the shore responded one after another and successively occupied important institutions such as the telegraph bureau. Ultimately, due to the disparity in numbers and the disparity in weapons, the land route failed one after another. The Zhaohe warship was also attacked by the rebel parties Yingrui and Tongji, making it difficult to defend. Comrade Yang Hu and others had no choice but to disguise themselves and swim away. The wounded comrades in the ship were all captured and killed by Yuan's army. This loud and thunderous event that shocked China and foreign countries unfortunately ended in failure. Considering that the Zhaohe Uprising, although unsuccessful, at a time when Yuan's imperial dream was in full swing and a group of shameless people were petitioning for and urging him to advance, our revolutionary soldiers were able to assassinate Yuan's brave general and seize warships from heavy military pressure and strict logic, thus promoting the revolutionary forces lurking in various provinces to rise one after another. The cannon of Zhaohe can be described as the prelude to the destruction of the imperial system and the alarm bell to awaken the national soul. Dear seamen comrades, the grand event of the Zhaohe Uprising has been recorded in the history books and will be immortalized forever. The families of the martyrs of the Zhaohe Uprising have also been given preferential treatment by the central government by Comrade Yang Hu, who also founded Zhaohe Middle School, which widely accepts the children of the martyrs, so that their education is well-suited. The martyrs of Zhaohe have removed their burdens and can close their eyes in the afterlife. However, looking back at the universe, thorns and copper camels, the national crisis is imminent, and it is time for us to devote our lives to serve the country. Now, please raise two matters as common goals for our efforts: 1. Assist the government in eliminating the Red bandits and stabilizing society; 2. Work hard in our positions, increase production, and enrich national power. The storm is dark, but the cock is still crowing. I hope that my seamen comrades will work together to make it happen. Slogans: 1. The Zhaohe Uprising was a revolutionary feat to overthrow the imperial system and safeguard the Republic of China; 2. The Zhaohe Uprising was a major key to the revival of the Republic of China; 3. The Zhaohe Uprising was a successful prelude to the Yunnan Uprising; 4. The Zhaohe Uprising was a struggle between democratic forces and the remnants of autocracy; 5. To commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising, we must eliminate the Red bandits and stabilize society; 6. To commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising, we must strive for construction and enrich national power; 7. Inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Zhaohe Uprising predecessors to resist foreign aggression; 8. Long live the Kuomintang; 9. Long live the Republic of China. Propaganda Section of the Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Seamen, December.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Finland's Independence Day Today <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Finnish Nationals Hold Celebrations</p>
<p>Consulate General Broadcasts Special Programs</p>
<p>Today is the 17th anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Republic of Finland. Finnish nationals in this city will hold celebrations. According to reports, the President of Finland, Svinhufvud, was born in 1861 and comes from a prominent family. After graduating from the Faculty of Law of the University of Helsinki in 1886, he practiced law. Later, he organized a passive resistance movement with Finnish patriots to resist the Great Slavism in order to preserve Finland's internal independence. Although Finland had its own government, parliament, administrative organs, currency, and independent economic life at that time, it was under the rule of the Russian Emperor. Since 1809, when Finland broke away from Sweden due to war, successive Russian Emperors have sworn to abide by Finland's independent economic life. In 1809, the Russian authorities began to try to assimilate Finland into Russia, but the effect was to greatly damage the relationship between the two peoples and gain nothing. In 1905, Finland changed to a unicameral system. Two years later, Svinhufvud was elected as a member of parliament and served as the speaker of the parliament for several terms, taking great care to protect the happiness of the Finnish people. At the beginning of the European War, Russia's oppression of Finland became even more severe. Svinhufvud, then a judge of the local court, resisted the illegal orders of the Russian government and was arrested in November 1914 and exiled to a remote village in Tomsk, Siberia. A recent photo of the Finnish President, 1917.</p>
<p>In March of that year, the Finnish Revolution occurred, and Svinhufvud was able to return to his country and was warmly welcomed by the people. He was immediately appointed as the Minister of Justice. From the autumn of that year to January of 1891, he served as Prime Minister. On December 4, 1917, Svinhufvud, in his capacity as Prime Minister, delivered the government's resolution on Finland's independence at the plenary session of the Finnish Parliament. Two days later, it was formally announced by the Parliament. From January 1918 to the summer of 1930, Svinhufvud retired to the countryside, devoting himself to social undertakings and achieving much. He then returned to serve as Prime Minister until March 1931, when he was elected as the President of Finland. Since taking office, he has worked hard to govern the country, and the country's strength has been increasing, so he is greatly loved by the people. Although Svinhufvud is already 73 years old, he is physically strong and mentally vigorous. He is good at shooting and enjoys hunting. Last year, he won the national shooting competition for seniors. The people often call him "Old Peter" or "Finland's Elder Statesman," which shows their feelings for the founding father of the country.</p>
<p>The Finnish Consulate General in this city will take the 6th of this month as the 17th anniversary of Finland's independence and will specially broadcast a special program at the Duncun Radio Station on Minguo Road in this city from 7:45 PM to 8:30 PM.

<h3 id="e142">Zhu Pu Returns from Study Tour <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Discusses Danish Agricultural Cooperation</p>
<p>Zhu Pu, a counselor of the Executive Yuan and specialist of the Rural Rehabilitation Committee, was ordered this summer to go to Europe and the United States to study agricultural cooperation. He returned to Shanghai on the Empress of Canada yesterday (the 5th). A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met him on the ship and asked about the results of his trip. He answered as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Studied in More Than Ten Countries <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhu said, "I went abroad in early June of this year and it has been half a year now. During these six months, I have studied in more than ten countries, including Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, England, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, and the United States. The time spent in Denmark was the longest, almost three months. Because Denmark is known as a cooperative country, its agricultural cooperation is particularly developed. Therefore, when I went abroad, I focused on Denmark as my target. The results of the study were very satisfactory. India and Japan also have considerable achievements in agricultural cooperation. Unfortunately, I passed by in a hurry and did not have the opportunity to visit them, which I regret. Regarding the situation of Danish agricultural cooperation, it cannot be fully described in a short time. I will briefly talk about its general situation to inform the people of the country."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Danish Agricultural Cooperation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Denmark is a small country, with an area of only 16,576 square miles, which is less than half of Zhejiang, the smallest province in our country. Its population is only 3,550,656 people, which is less than half of Gansu, the smallest province in our country. But its agricultural abundance, social stability, and people's happiness are unmatched by any country in the world. The reason for this is entirely due to the success of the cooperative movement. The Danish people, nineteen, are members of the cooperative society. The history of the cooperative movement in Denmark is not very long. Seventy years ago, the situation in Denmark was no different from that in our country today. At that time, Denmark had just failed in the war against Prussia and Austria in 1864 and suffered extremely severe natural disasters. As a result, the decline of industry and the economic panic reached their peak. The Danish people, seeing the dangerous situation, tried to save themselves and followed the example of England in promoting the cooperative movement. It has only been a few decades since then.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Socialization of Distribution <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>"The most proud phenomenon of Denmark today is what Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: 'Socialization of distribution. The people of the whole country have neither the so-called rich nor the poor. Everyone is well-fed and clothed and happy. This has realized the ideal of cooperativism. At the same time, it is enough to show that this phenomenon cannot be achieved by capitalist countries or communist countries.' Denmark's agricultural products, pickled meat, eggs, and butter are the three major items. The countries with the widest sales are England and Germany. Ninety-nine percent of the pickled meat is sold to England, and only one percent is used by the country itself. Eighty-five percent of the eggs are sold to England, fourteen percent are sold to Germany, and only one percent is used by the country itself. Sixty-eight percent of the butter is sold to England, twenty-five percent is sold to Germany, and only seven percent is used by the country itself. Such things are too numerous to mention. In recent years, due to the general decline in the economic situation of various countries in the world, England has imposed a so-called quota system on Denmark's imported goods. Germany is on the verge of bankruptcy due to economic and financial difficulties and has no ability to buy foreign goods. Therefore, Denmark has been quite affected."</p>
<h3 id="e146">No Sign of Recession <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>"But according to my observation in various villages in Denmark, its prosperous image is still enviable everywhere and is by no means as fully expressed as the recession that can be seen at a glance in other countries. The economic foundation of the Danish countryside is extremely solid, and it is not enough to frustrate its slightest bit by being slightly affected by foreign countries for a while. After observing Denmark, I felt that agricultural cooperation should be promoted more in our country. At present, all parties in the government and the public have paid considerable attention to and promoted this, but it is hoped that the people of the country will rise up together and regard it as the only way to revitalize the countryside. The future of agriculture and people's livelihood in our country will rely on it."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Still Going Abroad for Study Tour <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Zhu feels slightly unwell due to the hardship of the journey and plans to rest in Shanghai for one or two days before going to Beijing to visit President Wang and report everything. It is also reported that Zhu has temporarily requested leave to return to the country for personal matters this time and will soon go to other countries for a long-term study tour and research to continue the unfinished mission.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Overseas Representatives Visit Domestic Goods Factories <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Overseas representatives of the Fifth Plenary Session recently took advantage of the postponement of the conference to travel to various parts of the country and inspect the industrial situation. The other day, they departed in batches from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in the capital. In addition to representatives from Vietnam and other countries going north to Jinan, Beiping, Zhangjiakou and other places for sightseeing, representatives from Siam, Penang, and the Dutch colonies also visited various stations along the Beijing-Shanghai Line in groups. When passing through Wuxi, they visited major factories. Yesterday they finished their sightseeing and came to Shanghai and stayed at the New Asia and Huizhong hotels. Upon arrival, they visited Liang Xinji's Liang Bozhi and asked him to introduce them to various factories in Shanghai. Then Liang Bozhi, together with Huang Hanliang of Guanshengyuan Food Factory, led them to visit various factories. After visiting Liang Xinji and Guanshengyuan factories in the morning of the 4th, they had lunch. Huang Hanliang hosted a banquet at the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing. In the afternoon, they visited Yifeng Enamel Factory and Kangyuan Canning Factory and visited Xiang Kangyuan, the general manager of the factory. Mr. Xiang has traveled to the South twice in recent years and has given a very deep impression to overseas Chinese in various places. Therefore, the representatives went to Kangyuan Factory as soon as they arrived in Shanghai. The representatives were invited by Yang Hu, the director of the Security Office, yesterday morning to visit the Wusong Fort and the Jiangnan Shipyard. Today, Liang Bozhi will continue to lead them to visit various factories in Shanghai. The preparatory committees of the National Goods Manufacturers Association along the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways have scheduled to convene major manufacturers during the day, invite the representatives to a banquet at Guanshengyuan, and plan to invite them to give speeches on the recent situation in Southeast Asia and the recent situation of overseas Chinese industry and commerce, so that the factories in Shanghai can get a general idea of developing to the South.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Lu Zuofu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: Lu Zuofu, the general manager of the Chongqing Minsheng Industrial Company, came to Shanghai by plane yesterday to inspect the business of the Shanghai branch. The reporter met Lu at Lu's residence yesterday and asked about the situation of the Sichuan River shipping industry. According to him, it can only maintain the status quo and there is no hope of revitalization, and it is worse than the situation at the same time last year. The shipping cost of cotton yarn is eight yuan per piece, which is slightly higher than before, because the Sichuan River is dry, so it has to be slightly increased to supplement it.</p>

<p>800,000 Yuan to be Released First on the 15th of this Month</p>
<p>Monthly Interest of 8% to Begin in February Next Year</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports: The Anhui Provincial Government, due to the severity of this year's famine and the sharp reduction in tax revenues, is experiencing difficulties in administrative expenses. Mao Longzhang, the Director of the Finance Department, came to Shanghai to contact the Central, China, Jiaotong, Shanghai, and China Industrial Banks. It was decided to borrow 1.2 million yuan at a monthly interest rate of 8%. The repayment will begin in February next year and will be repaid in full in 20 months. The draft loan contract was signed in Shanghai on the 24th of last month. Director Mao took it back to Anhui Province and reported it to the provincial government. It will be officially signed in Wuhu. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency learned from the borrowing bank yesterday morning that the formal loan contract for Anhui Province has been sent from Shanghai to Wuhu. The Finance Department of the province has sent Li Shiqian to Wuhu to be responsible for contacting the branches of the lending banks. It can be officially signed within days. As for the release of funds, it was originally stipulated that 800,000 yuan would be released on December 1, 200,000 yuan would be released on February 1 next year, and 200,000 yuan would be released on June 1. Since the formal contract could not be signed as scheduled before December 1, the first installment, which was scheduled to be released on December 1, has now been decided to be changed to December 15, when the Wuhu branches of the lending banks will release 800,000 yuan to the Anhui Provincial Government. The remaining 400,000 yuan will still be released on the originally scheduled date.</p>

The society believes that the relief funds are limited and insufficient to handle the situation alone, so it is jointly managed with the Shanghai Foreign Relief Association, the Shanghai Relief Association, and the Hai Ning local relief associations. In terms of the number of households to be restored, the amount received per person is very small. It is not yet time to consider winter plowing and saving lives. Other areas, such as Haiyan, which have suffered disasters, are also planning to distribute emergency relief. The society is unable to support this on its own, and the funds for joint management have not yet been collected, making it difficult to start. Furthermore, many counties in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have suffered severe disasters. Representatives reported that their tears had run dry in Shanghai. The society is currently unable to proceed. Although the number of relief funds received is decreasing due to the sluggish market, fellow philanthropists at home and abroad should, in this time of extraordinary disaster, make vows to provide relief. The merit is ten times greater than usual. Saving one person's life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. The more people you save, the greater the merit and the immeasurable blessings. Moreover, it is now winter, and hunger and cold are biting. The lives of half of the disaster victims who have not yet died are hanging by a thread, and their suffering is indescribable.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Guo Bufei and Finance Director Zhao Dihua are concerned about helping the common people of this province who are engaged in small-scale businesses.

Wu Yunzhai, manager of Shanghai Jin Cheng Bank, Hou Houpei, deputy manager of Farmers Bank, and Tian Shitai, assistant manager of Jiangsu Bank, were appointed as directors of the board. Yang Zhaoxiong and Chen Qiwei, commissioned by the Finance Department, were appointed as supervisors. The loan regulations and operating guidelines were also passed. Hou Houpei was elected as the managing director. The loan rules limit the use of the funds and are divided into four categories: ㈠ Wholesale purchase of goods or raw materials ㈡ Purchase of handicraft and agricultural tools, advance payments for promoting national goods, ㈣ Other productive uses. Any small-scale farmers and merchants with a fixed address and a legitimate business can apply for a loan. The general office is located at the Zhenjiang Farmers Bank, and the first branch office is at the Jiangsu Bank outside Zhenjiang. It is expected to be established and begin lending soon. The loan amount ranges from one yuan to a maximum of one hundred yuan. In the future, small-scale common people will undoubtedly benefit greatly.

<p>In order to promote the development of the Greater Shanghai Plan and gradually realize it, the municipal government and its various bureaus have successively moved into the office buildings in the city center this year and released ten plots of land for acquisition. Both the first and second releases were completely acquired. The second release has now been made. Because the municipal stadium, library, swimming pool, etc. have all been laid and are under construction, water and land transportation will be improved. A Qiujiang wharf will be built for water transportation, and a light rail line will be built for land transportation, connecting the Songhu, Jinghu, and Huhangyong railways, so that transportation will be easier. Therefore, the high-quality land acquired during the first release has already risen to six or seven thousand yuan per mu. The land released during the second release is divided into Grade A and Grade B, with the acquisition price approximately three thousand yuan per mu. The period for acquiring plots of one mu has ended. Since November 11th, the period for releasing plots of two to four mu has begun. Those who go to acquire the land are exceptionally enthusiastic. All land acquisition rules can be obtained from the Land Bureau. In order to facilitate acquisition, the Shanghai Municipal Bank, the Bank of China, the Shanghai Bank, and the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company have been entrusted to distribute the rules on behalf of the Land Bureau.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Postal Authority, as the end of the year approaches, the New Year's cards and other mail received and sent by the post office will inevitably become crowded day by day.

<h3 id="e170">Health Bureau Investigates the Cause of Food Poisoning <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Confirmed That the Tragedy Was Caused by Cooking and Selling Pufferfish</p>
<p>On November 28th, a food poisoning incident occurred at the Xieshunxing restaurant on Oujia Road in Zhabei, resulting in the death of as many as eleven diners. There were various rumors about the cause of the poisoning. The Municipal Health Bureau dispatched personnel to investigate the matter thoroughly on the 29th and determined that it was caused by cooking and selling pufferfish that poisoned the diners. The following is the Health Bureau's handling of this case: The Health Bureau dispatched Cheng Shuzhen, the director of the Health Experiment Institute, Wu Liguo, the chief of the Third Section, and Jiang Shicheng, a technician, to investigate. Director Cheng and others first went to the Linping Road Police Station, which has jurisdiction over the area, and were received by Police Officer Chen. They also questioned the shop employees who were in custody. According to them, the shop had purchased over a hundred catties of fish with black backs and white bellies, about half a foot long, four days ago. They cooked a pot every day and sold it to diners by the bowl. At 2 PM yesterday, two customers came to the shop and questioned why they felt numb and heavy-headed after eating the fish. Unexpectedly, two hours later, the two died in the shop one after another. When asked what kind of fish they had purchased and cooked, they claimed that it was indeed pufferfish and that they dared not lie. They then went to inspect the Xieshunxing restaurant, where they saw that the door was closed and a police officer was guarding it. Inside, they saw two corpses with no special phenomena. They did not find any remaining fish, only fish bones and shredded fish meat in the rice bucket. There seemed to be vomit on the ground, but it had been swept away. They then visited the Tongren Hospital, where they were received by Dr. Huang Mingxin. According to him, five poisoned patients were sent in succession on the afternoon of the 28th. One person died before arriving at the hospital, and two others were completely paralyzed, had difficulty breathing, and had dilated pupils with no spasms. Artificial respiration was used, but soon their breathing stopped, although their hearts were still active. Finally, they died. Another patient had almost recovered and was not in danger. When asked what they had eaten, they said they had only eaten a bowl of fish and rice and had not drunk alcohol. Unexpectedly, an hour after eating, their lips and fingers first became numb, followed by their whole body. They felt heavy-headed and short of breath and knew that something was wrong. They quickly used their hands to induce vomiting a total of five times. After being admitted to the hospital, they gradually recovered. Based on the results of the investigation, it was determined that it was pufferfish poisoning. It was also reported that the pufferfish in the shop had been purchased from the 16th Pier. The Health Bureau has notified the French Concession Public Works Bureau to strictly ban this practice. As for the medical treatment after poisoning, in addition to injecting cardiac stimulants and using artificial respiration, injecting adrenaline and pituitary extract can be effective.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Continued Trial of Lu Xihou Case at the China Industrial Bank <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Lu Plans to Sell Private Property to Repay Debts</p>
<p>Xu First Trialed the Criminal Case and Then Retried the Civil Case</p>
<p>After the China Industrial Bank closed down, Lu Xihou, its managing director, and Lu Mengxiang, who took over as manager after the fleeing manager Qin Baoyuan, and Sun Xiren, the manager of the Shenghua Trading Company set up by Qin Baoyuan, were found by the police to have colluded in fraud. They were all detained and sent to the First Special District Local Court for prosecution according to law. Subsequently, the police continued to apprehend Chen Jikan, Xiang Xiang, Wu Lihua, Feng Weiqin, Lu Ruizheng, Wan Weijian, Zhou Shaopeng, Wang Qi, Lu Xifan, Wang Jixuan, etc., who were all important responsible persons of the bank. They were all additionally prosecuted together. The court has repeatedly summoned them for trial, but not all defendants have appeared in court. Among those who complied with the summons, except for Lu Xihou who was detained, Lu Mengxiang and Sun Xiren were released on bail to await further trial. The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Judge Hong Yeye conducted another trial. Many creditors, concerned about their interests, still</p>
<h3 id="e172">Attended the Hearing <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The lawyer for the police prosecutor, Ru Baobi, stated that regarding the China Industrial Bank's mortgaging of title deeds to the Si Ming Bank, the judge had personally gone to Si Ming on the 29th of last month to investigate the relevant accounts, and a report has already been submitted for review. Judge Qian then instructed Lu Xihou, stating that the China Industrial Bank used four title deeds as collateral to obtain treasury bonds from the Si Ming Bank on October 25th of last year. The total amount of treasury bonds obtained was 270,000. These title deeds were originally mortgaged by your wife, Wang Guozhi, to the savings department of the China Industrial Bank on October 24th for a consideration of 70,000 yuan. According to your confession, the collateral must be transferred to another account. However, this court investigated the Thales Yanghang and Aierde Yanghang, where the title deeds were registered, and found that one deed from Thales was transferred on the 21st of the month,</p>
<h3 id="e173">To Si Ming's Account <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>And three deeds from Aierde were transferred to Si Ming's account on October 23rd. The dates are all before the date you stated that Wang Guozhi mortgaged them to the China Industrial Bank. Even if it is not a case of one deed being used twice, in any case, the mortgage to the China Industrial Bank must be nominal. Lu, upon hearing this instruction, confessed that the title deeds were originally taken from his wife and then transferred to Si Ming. However, he previously stated that his memory of the date was unclear. The judge then asked the defendant Sun Xiren, "Qin Baoyuan previously confessed at the police station that after the China Industrial Bank went bankrupt, you still often went to the bank to hold meetings. What did you discuss?" Sun completely denied this. Lu Mengxiang said that he had seen Sun go to the bank once, but he had not heard about the buying and selling of rayon. Judge Qian then instructed Lu Xihou again, stating that according to the accountant's</p>
<h3 id="e174">Accounting Results <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The savings department owes more than 560,000 yuan. This court has appointed another judge to handle the liquidation matters. How will you handle the aftermath? Lu's defense lawyer, Wu Linkun, immediately argued that although the savings department owed more than 500,000, Lu's relatives and friends accounted for more than 100,000, so the net amount owed to outsiders was only more than 300,000. Lu has decided to sell his private property to repay the debts. Prominent businessmen such as Yu Qiaqing are willing to guarantee Lu's release so that he can quickly handle the matter. Therefore, they have submitted a statement requesting Lu's release on bail. Judge Qian then continued to instruct, "In addition to the savings department, the commercial department still owes more than 400,000. Since you have decided to sell your private property to settle the debts, you should quickly submit a list of your assets and request the judge who is handling the liquidation to handle the matter. The criminal part of this case will be adjourned for the time being. As for the request to suspend the detention, it is difficult to approve at this time. However, regarding the crimes you are accused of, ultimately"</p>
<h3 id="e175">Guilt or Innocence <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The determination of the crime is not yet final, and whether bail should be granted also needs to be carefully considered and decided upon. In short, this court handles this case with utmost impartiality. There is no need for anyone to seek intervention. You must know that this court only knows to handle matters according to the law, and external requests are unlikely to be beneficial. I am afraid your family members may be deceived, so I am issuing this warning." After the instruction, the court adjourned. The civil court judge, Yu Changzi, took the bench, instructing the petitioners Lu Xihou and Lu Mengxiang, who had requested liquidation, to stand in the defendant's dock. He instructed them to submit a list of assets and the total amount of debt according to the liquidation regulations. Xihou immediately stated that all accounting books and documents had been detained by the arresting authorities, making it impossible to comply. Judge Yu then stated that the court would request them from the arresting authorities and inquired about the amount of debt. Xihou replied that the total owed to others was 940,000, with one creditor in</p>
<h3 id="e176">Hubei Provincial Government <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>owing as much as 600,000. Despite repeated demands, and informing him that this amount was related to the guarantee for savings depositors, not a single penny had been repaid. Upon investigation, over 100,000 of the total debt belonged to my relatives and friends. These creditors are all willing to deposit their passbooks and receipts with the court and are willing to be the last to be repaid. As for other debts, they will first be repaid from the 200,000 in assets still in the bank. If that is not enough, I am determined to liquidate my private property to clear the debts. He then presented the passbooks and receipts of his relatives and friends, as well as the title deeds and mortgages of his private property, as evidence of the truth of his words. Thereupon, lawyer Wu Linkun reiterated the request for bail, stating that if the defendant were not detained, the small depositors whose savings were at risk would have already recovered their funds, as Lu had intended to raise 200,000 to settle with these depositors at the time of the collapse. The court stated that the matter of bail should be decided by the criminal court and instructed Lu Xihou to remain in custody, while Lu Mengxiang and others would have their bail reassessed at a later date.</p>

<p>Injured Kidnapper Also Not Yet Healed</p>
<p>Case Adjourned for Trial Next Week</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Yu, a Cantonese resident at No. 64, Avenue Amiral de Gueydon in the French Concession, was kidnapped around 8 a.m. on October 21st while taking a chartered car to the cathedral for mass. The kidnapping occurred near the intersection of the Jiangsu Higher Court, Jiangsu First Branch Court, and Jiangsu Second Branch Court, not far from her home. The kidnappers sent a letter to her family demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. It was not until the 19th of last month that the Jiangning Police Station learned that Ziying and Zhou Bingcheng, etc. were at the Sanxin Inn outside the Chang Gate in Suzhou posing as representatives sent by the victim to negotiate the ransom. Two kidnappers from Shaoxing, Li Xiaoxiao, and Wang Fukang from Huzhou were apprehended. After interrogation, they revealed that the hostage was being held in a room at No. 186 Jianlin Road, Hongkou, Shanghai. The French Concession police were immediately notified by long-distance telephone and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, along with additional Chinese and foreign detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station, to rescue the hostage and arrest Hui Zhi, the guard, and Zhou Juqin, a woman. At the time, the kidnappers opened fire to resist the detectives, who returned fire. Two kidnappers, Lin De and Tao Shuigen, were wounded. Simultaneously, detective Zhang Chunsheng from the police station was also shot and wounded. All were sent to the Guangci Hospital. Meanwhile, detectives Zhang and Zhou transported the two kidnappers, Li and Wang, from Suzhou to Shanghai, where they were handed over to the First Special Court for detention and investigation.

<h3 id="e183">Petition from the Bihan Shelter for Vacating the Chao Hui Mountain Villa <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The poor have nowhere to go and suffer greatly</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Bihan Shelter of the Charitable Organizations Federation yesterday submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau stating, "[Respectfully submitted, this association has been running the Bihan Shelter since 1927, and a second branch was established in the Chao Hui Mountain Villa. The buildings in the mountain villa are relatively large and can accommodate a larger number of people. Over the years, the shelter set up in the mountain villa has accommodated more than 3,000 people. This year, due to the stationing of over 100 security team members in the mountain villa, the second Bihan Shelter cannot be opened. There are no suitable places in the Nanshi area to accommodate people. This year, due to rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial decline, the general population of poor people and unemployed workers is even larger than in previous years. Although the Bihan Shelter has already started accepting people at the Chaozhou Guildhall on the first of this month, it has reached over 500 people in a few days, and poor people continue to arrive in droves, in a miserable and distressing state. It is difficult to find an official place to put them, so we hereby submit this letter to your bureau, requesting that you forward it to the municipal government, asking them to consider the plight of the poor and order the security department to quickly find a way to temporarily move the stationed troops in the mountain villa. The shelter can be returned when the Bihan Shelter finishes its work next spring. This matter concerns relief, so we earnestly request that you promptly review and reply. This is submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.]" It is heard that the shelter is urgently seeking to expand its location, and it is expected that the authorities will provide assistance to maximize relief efforts. The internal staff of the shelter includes General Manager Zhang Zixin, Accountant Tan Qiutian, General Affairs Chen Yousheng, Document Clerk Wang Shuliu, Clothing Manager Zheng Jingyan, Xu Nianchun, Registration Wang Jueyu, Zhao Jinshen, Reception Kong Xianzhang, Inspection Zhu Boying, and Managers Xu Tianxi, Lu Jiqing, and Mao Jianqing, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Large Quantity of Red Pills Confiscated at South Railway Station <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>217,000 Red Pills Abandoned</p>
<p>Traffickers Abandoned Pills and Fled</p>
<p>At around 5:50 a.m. yesterday at the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, while it was still dark, gold-wearing guard Jin Zhongfu of the Chenjiaqiao Police Station of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was changing shifts at the front gate of the station. Suddenly, a rickshaw coming from the east carrying a large wooden box, a large rattan black lacquered box, a medium-sized leather suitcase, and a net basket, and one passenger wearing a black robe and a cotton hat with tied threads, about thirty years old and speaking in the local dialect, arrived. As the passenger and the boxes and baskets on the rickshaw got off at the station, guard Jin Zhongfu, who was switching positions with Officer Hu Zhao (the official inspectors had not yet arrived at the station), saw the passenger carrying three large boxes at such an early hour, which seemed suspicious. Therefore, he asked the passenger to open them for inspection. The passenger falsely claimed that the key was with the owner in the back and that he would come right away. At that moment, two other rickshaws arrived, carrying two passengers and luggage. The guard was busy inspecting them and missed the opportunity to prevent the first passenger from abandoning two of the boxes and fleeing without a trace. The guard waited until about 7:00 a.m. without seeing anyone come to claim them, concluding that there was likely a trick involved. He immediately reported to Patrol Leader Hu of the Chenjiaqiao Police Station, who forwarded it to Patrol Inspector Su of the Gaochangmiao Substation and requested instructions. Patrol Inspector Su immediately reported to Director Li of the Ximen Branch by telephone. Director Li personally drove to the South Railway Station and brought the three abandoned boxes and the net basket to the Gaochangmiao Substation for inspection. The large wooden box was filled with eight large packages wrapped in Shen Bao newspaper, which, when opened, were found to contain red pills. Another six large packages were found in the large rattan black lacquered box. Further inspection of the medium-sized leather suitcase also revealed six large packages, making a total of 20 large packages, or 217 bags, each containing approximately 1,000 pills, totaling 217,000 red pills. The prohibited boxes and the net basket were taken to the Ximen Branch and sent to the main bureau for verification. Officers were dispatched to investigate the traffickers and other accomplices and to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Stepmother Sues Son and Daughter-in-Law Case <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Judge's Efforts to Mediate Reconciliation Prove Futile</p>
<p>Result: Housemaid Assaulted, Fines Imposed</p>
<p>Zui Shi, the stepmother of Xie Guozhen and Xie Zhou, filed a lawsuit with the Huishi Police against them, and Zhu Zhou, Zhou's sister, and her husband Zhu Songzhou, for jointly injuring her and assaulting the housemaid Hongmei. The case was brought to the First Special Court. Details of the trial have been reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court continued the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendants' lawyers, Zou Yu and Liu Shifang, stated that after ten adjournments, the manager of the American Zui Shi Foreign Company, Mr. Kauff, had intervened to mediate the plaintiff's request for the return of 1,000 yuan in marriage expenses and was still in discussions, requesting an adjournment. However, the plaintiff's lawyer, Yi Yiping, denied any reconciliation. Judge Zhan stated that the case was a family dispute between a mother and son and should not be litigated. The result of litigation would inevitably further damage the relationship between the parties. He urged reconciliation. However, Xie Zheng and Xie Yibin insisted on resolving the matter according to the law. Xie Guozhen stated that although he had not beaten his stepmother, he would be willing to compensate his stepmother for the sake of ending the lawsuit and maintaining family harmony. However, the plaintiff firmly refused. Judge Zhan's attempts at reconciliation were unsuccessful, and he proceeded with the trial. The plaintiff's incidental civil suit requested 50 yuan in medical expenses. The testimony was largely the same as the previous time (reported in this newspaper on the 29th of last month, omitted for brevity). After the police lawyer Jiang Zhilian and the lawyers for the plaintiff and defendants debated each other, Judge Zhan announced the judgment in court: Xie Guozhen and Zhu Songzhou were each fined 50 yuan for bodily harm, with a two-year suspended sentence. Xie Zhou and Zhu Zhou were found not guilty. The plaintiff's incidental civil suit was dismissed. Police lawyer Jiang requested that the defendants be required to post bail during the appeal period. The court then ordered the four defendants to post 100 yuan in cash or a shop guarantee each during the appeal period. Xie and Zhu were convicted of assaulting the housemaid Hongmei, while Zheng was not convicted because the evidence against her was insufficient.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Russian Vendetta Case <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>First Kills Friend's Wife</p>
<p>Then Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>Russian Belia Lachuck, also known as Simon (transliteration), 40 years old this year, had no occupation or address in Shanghai. Recently, he had a feud with Yevgenia Ivanovskaya (transliteration, 26 years old), the wife of his compatriot Yefim Ivanovsky (transliteration, 30 years old), who lived in Room 8 of Company House No. 10, Lane 9, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession (one theory is that he was jealous due to unrequited love). He planned to kill the woman. At around 3:00 p.m. on the 4th, he hid a knife and rushed to the woman's house. Catching her off guard, he suddenly stabbed the woman in a vital area, killing her instantly. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the murderer suddenly committed suicide out of fear of punishment. He stabbed himself in the head and neck, pushed open the window, and jumped down, suffering internal and external injuries, dying on the spot. The French police were informed and sent detectives to investigate. They transported the bodies of the man and woman to the autopsy room attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court dispatched an investigator, a forensic doctor, and a clerk to the hospital to examine the two bodies. After questioning Ivanovsky, the woman's husband, he instructed that Ivanovskaya's death was caused by knife wounds, and the body was handed over to Ivanovsky for burial. He also instructed that Belia Lachuck's death was caused by suicide, and the body was handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for burial.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that Russian Bai Sichuzhi, 36 years old, residing at No. 3, Hehe Lane, Avenue Joffre, yesterday severed the throat of Russian Ivanovska's wife, 25 years old, with a razor due to jealousy. Bai committed suicide by cutting his throat and jumping out of a window from an upper floor. The Second Special District Court examined the two bodies this morning. The incident occurred at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. Ivanovska had left home only minutes before. Ivanovska did not return home until 7:00 p.m., when he learned of his wife's murder. After Ivanovska left home, the murderer, Bai, rushed to the second floor, where the Ivanovska couple lived. Soon, a dispute was heard between Bai and Mrs. Ivanovskaya. Bai and Mrs. Ivanovskaya had been in love for a long time, as everyone knew. Bai had tried to persuade the woman to abandon her husband and run away with him, but had failed. When a housemate went to check because of the loud noise, she found Mrs. Ivanovskaya dead in a pool of blood. She had been killed by Bai with a long razor that cut her throat. Bai fell to the ground below. By the time the police arrived, Bai was dying. Bai had worked at the cafe opened by Ivanovska in Qingdao this summer. Ivanovska had recently been employed by a brewery on Broadway Road. However, both were currently unemployed. Mrs. Ivanovskaya came to Shanghai from Harbin five years ago and married Ivanovska. Her parents and a younger brother and sister still live in Harbin.</p>
<h3 id="e188">American Boxer Sues Dance Hall Manager <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Assaulted by Musician in Dance Hall, Sues for Damages</p>
<p>Feng Yixiang, 43 years old, from Nantong, and Dong Yunlong, 40 years old, both locals, jointly invested in the Dongfeng Company at No. 9, Avenue Edward VII, opening the Dahua and Dahu dance halls. They also opened a dance hall in the Yiyuan Garden on Rue Amiral Courbet, which was very successful. They hired a Westerner, Entro (transliteration), as manager. Recently, American boxer Riley (transliteration), residing at Apartment 11, No. 96 Boulevard des deux Republiques in the Public Concession, has hired lawyer Fan Kelin to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Feng Yixiang and Dong Yunlong, seeking damages of 5,000 US dollars (approximately 15,000 yuan in national currency) for injuries sustained in an assault by a black musician at the dance hall. According to the plaintiff's statement of claim, he often went to the Yiyuan dance hall during his leisure time. On the evening of the 12th of last month, he was suddenly assaulted by twelve black musicians employed by the dance hall, causing him to be covered in injuries. The defendants, as employers of the dance hall musicians, failed to take preventive measures beforehand and did not stop them afterward, causing the plaintiff to suffer physical, mental, and economic losses due to the defendants' negligence, totaling 5,000 US dollars. He requests that the defendants be ordered to compensate him. The court accepted the case, and Judge Tu Shenjie summoned the two defendants and their defense lawyer, Wu Pengfei, to court in the Civil Courtroom 7 yesterday morning. First, the plaintiff presented his case. Then, the defendant's lawyer argued that the plaintiff was skilled in boxing. That night, the plaintiff entered the dance hall and was guided by the receptionist Dong Ajin to Seat 86 near the music platform. Before the plaintiff could sit down, he waved the leader of the band to come down from the stage and punched him to the ground when he was unprepared. All the dancers were indignant at this time, and the plaintiff fled. About an hour later, he returned, claiming to be looking for his lost wallet containing 80 yuan. He searched everywhere but could not find it and left. The business of the dance hall suffered considerable losses that night due to his disturbance. The defendant had originally intended to sue him, but because he enjoyed consular jurisdiction, he was still considering whether to proceed. The plaintiff took the initiative and filed a false complaint with the court, requesting compensation. He should be dismissed. The court then summoned witnesses and declared the debate closed, scheduling a ruling in ten days.</p>

<p>To the editor: According to Mr. Li Xueqin, manager of Qin Yu Company, the party involved, he claimed that yesterday, upon reading the report "Qin Yu Lane Landlord Cuts Off Water, Tenants Ask for Relief from the City Federation" published on the third page of the Shen Bao on the 3rd of this month, the content was completely inconsistent with the facts and concerned the reputation of the company. The lane rents are low, and as tap water prices rose, the company, bearing the burden, made each room rally to delay rent payment until the water shut off. The matter is concerned with meter installation, is being resolved legally, and is by no means oppressive. The tenant was influenced by someone, thereby turning right and wrong upside down and confusing things. The company requests that the Shen Bao editor uphold justice, investigate the truth, and specially commissions your esteemed lawyer to write to the newspaper for correction. According to this, a corresponding letter is sent, hoping that the newspaper publishes the original letter in the "Letter to the Editor" section for correction.

<p>Dr. Eddy's Speech, Rapidly Recorded by Bingxun Rapid Recording Agency, Shen Wan Rapid Recording</p>
<p>China is now in great danger. Eradicating communism cannot be achieved by simply killing a few heads. We must find the causes and try to eliminate them. These causes are roughly: (1) poverty, (2) unemployment, (3) oppression, and (4) disappointment. I just came from Sichuan. We know that Sichuan is the most abundant and well-irrigated province. There used to be no famine, but now it has become the poorest province. What is the reason for this? (1) The scourge of opium, (2) the warlord system, exploiting the people and even pre-collecting taxes until the 60th year of the Republic, (3) oppression of farmers, and (4) the Communist Party. This time, near the suburbs of Chengdu in Sichuan, I saw many graves, all of whom were communists who had been killed. When I passed through Jiangxi, I met General Kong Hechong. I asked him why he joined the Communist Party and then surrendered to the National Army. He replied, "If a poor child in Hunan has no food to eat at the age of sixteen, then he joins the Communist Party. After receiving six months of education in the Communist Party, the Communist Party calls me to fight. I led the Sixth Army with 75,000 people and captured Changsha. Once I had four million yuan in my hand, but I did not take a penny for myself and distributed it all to the soldiers." I asked him how many people he had killed. He said, "More than 30,000 people." I asked him how he killed them. He said, "First kill the poor to show the rich, to scare them. Line up the captured people, with the poor standing in front, the small and medium rich standing in the middle, and the richest at the end. I would first ask the poor people where the money is. If they answered that they had none, I would cut off their ears and kill them. Later, I also used this method to seize the money of the poor. Even those with ten yuan on them were called capitalists. Salt was sold for one yuan a catty, and cloth was sold for one yuan a foot. Later, I realized that this communist system, in theory and in practice, was not feasible. This principle failed because China does not have large capitalists, only the poor, and everyone can be communist. I felt that this system was the opposite of my original intention to join the Communist Party to save the people, so I left immediately." I believe his words are very sincere. The same method is used in Soviet Russia, but I think it is wrong. We must manage our own homes well before we can manage others. Slaughter is not a good solution. I do not agree with the policy of slaughter. I think the communist danger in Jiangxi was building good roads to suppress the communists. I think suppressing the communists requires educating and guiding them. When I was in Hunan, I found an ancient stele with writings from 3,500 years ago. Although China has such a long history of writing, education is still not widespread. In Japan, nearly 99% of children have received education in the last 30 years, and even coolies can read and write. In Soviet Russia, 90% of children have also enjoyed education within ten years. China had good writing 3,500 years ago, but three-quarters of its people have not received education, and 90% of farmers cannot read and write. They are all struggling in poverty. In North China, the people not only do not have the right to be educated, but some people also take their wheat as taxes. I heard that there are more than 60 kinds of taxes in North China, leaving the people to live in ignorance, lack of knowledge, poverty, and separation. China as a whole is a plate of loose sand, but from an individual point of view, it is very good. The Japanese are not as good as the Chinese. They have very few great people like Ito Hirobumi, but they can unite and cooperate. China cannot cooperate and often has disputes. China has already had 151 civil wars, which is a sign of division and a major cause of national decline. We know that a government cannot always be in revolution. It must unite. I am not saying that the Nanjing government is perfect, or that President Roosevelt's American government is perfect. I am a member of the Socialist Party, and I disagree with him, but I always support him. Now, China's greatest needs can be divided into five categories: (1) education, so that everyone enjoys education, (2) politics, so that we have a clean government, (3) moral strength, (4) economic health, rural construction, and (5) social reform, so that everyone can develop equally.

<h3 id="e204">The National Goods Year Cannot Be Blamed on Women <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>This year, the import of cosmetics and perfumes has broken previous records. Everyone is saying that the achievements of the Women's National Goods Year are like this, which is extremely ironic. This view is completely wrong. If this year were not the Women's National Goods Year, would these more than two million dollars worth of cosmetics, perfumes, lace, and jewelry not have been imported? If we didn't promote national goods, could foreign goods not be so rampant? I dare to boldly say that it is fortunate that this year is the Women's National Goods Year, and there is still a group of fools running around, shouting and urging women who do not know how to love their country to use national goods. Otherwise, in this era of rampant human desires and extravagance, I am afraid that the import volume of cosmetics and perfumes would be even greater. In short, people's ridicule is nothing more than indignation, and it does not contain malice. As long as we women strive to make a difference in the future, we will not use any Parisian powder or French rouge. Using national cosmetics and perfumes on the face and body will be worthy of the Women's National Goods Year. If we are willing to admire foreign goods and be ridiculed, then the social sanctions will be very strong. I am afraid that in the future, if someone sees you wearing foreign cosmetics on your face and foreign perfume on your body, they will cover their noses and pass by, scolding you as the most shameless. How can you still show off?</p>

<h3 id="e205">New Prospects for the National Goods Movement <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>Next Year Designated as the Student National Goods Year</p>
<p>The National Goods Year has already passed, and the [Women's National Goods Year] is also coming to an end. Although the results of efforts to promote national goods in the past two years have been minimal, especially the increase in imports of goods such as chewing gum, cosmetics, perfume, and toys this year has exceeded our expectations. But can we be discouraged because of this? No, definitely not. Only by intensifying our efforts can we promote and develop the national goods movement. All obstacles and difficulties are inevitable in any [pioneering] work. [The beginning is simple, but the end will be great]. Although the current harvest is not much, success may be in the near future, I believe.</p>
<p>Next year has been designated as the Student National Goods Year. I have endless thoughts about this naming.</p>
<p>Although the dumping of foreign goods is ubiquitous, with their traces everywhere, even in remote areas, the consumption in cities is definitely higher than in rural areas. And goods such as chewing gum, cosmetics, perfume, and toys are even more unrelated to rural areas. The loyal users of national goods are still mostly hardworking farmers. Some of the promoters of foreign goods are educated students. From stationery to clothing, foreign goods often take the place of national goods in schools. This phenomenon is very common and cannot be denied, which is so heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Therefore, in recent years, the central government and the education authorities have repeatedly ordered schools to purchase supplies and student clothing, which must use national goods. Local governments, such as Guangdong Province, have also stipulated that students should use writing brushes and domestic paper as much as possible and are not allowed to abuse pens and foreign paper. However, although the bans are strict, are they not actually [obeyed in appearance but disobeyed in reality] and treated as mere formalities?</p>
<p>Originally, promoting national goods cannot be achieved by any official decree. It is necessary to change the psychology of the general public, cultivate a habit of loving national goods, and gradually promote it, so that it becomes a fashion of the time. This is the only way to achieve practical results. Schools are places to educate citizens, and students are promising young people and the future masters of the country. They should have the courage to [practice what they preach] and take action that is their duty when it comes to promoting national goods and saving the country from danger.</p>
<p>[Past mistakes cannot be admonished], the past mistakes, there is no need to say, and they are unbearable to mention. [The future is still reachable], we can only hope that in the Student National Goods Year of next year, the male and female students in all the large, medium, and small schools across the country will have a sense of self-awareness. In addition to [practicing what they preach], they should also assume the responsibility of doing their best to advocate and urge their families and society. Students are the intellectual class, and they are likely to win the sympathy and belief of the general public. They will definitely be able to bring the national goods movement to a bright path. The significance of [Student National Goods Year] is more profound than [National Goods Year] and [Women's National Goods Year], and the reason lies in this. If it is famous but not real, it would be a disservice to the five words [Student National Goods Year].</p>
<p>At the same time, it is hoped that the school authorities will purchase supplies with strict and accurate amounts, adopting national goods. And national goods factories should also manufacture various educational supplies as much as possible to meet the needs. This is the only way to leave a deep impression on the students. In fact, there are many educational supplies at present that cannot be replaced by national goods, which cannot be considered a major regret. To make up for this regret, we need the efforts of all parties to create a new situation in the coming year and add a special color to the national goods movement.</p>
<h3 id="e206">The Philippine Carnival and National Goods Promotion <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Run Shen</p>
<p>Reading the Shen Bao, I learned that Mayor Wu has initiated participation in the Philippine Carnival. I once worked as an editor for the Manila New Fujian Newspaper. I still have some memory of the carnival's impact. And I have a few points to offer regarding overseas national goods promotion. Therefore, I have written this book for the reference of participants.</p>
<p>Every year on February 1, the Philippine government holds a carnival in Manila, P.I. Before the event, Chinese and Western newspapers print election tickets. Cutting them off can be used to elect the carnival queen. The election tickets are sent by various newspapers. The numbers are totaled and published daily in the newspapers. The heat of the election almost reaches 100 degrees on the thermometer, which is beyond the reach of our country's elections.</p>
<p>A few days before the opening, the newspapers will send the queen with the most votes to the association's office for a second election. After the queen is selected, a welcome queen conference will be held the day before the opening. No matter what country you are from, anyone who participates in the conference can register at the association's office in advance. On this morning, costumed welcomers gathered at the venue and marched to the queen's residence to greet her. The queen sat on a three- or four-story-high platform, circumnavigating to the venue. Spectators lined the streets and competed to throw colorful paper strips. When the paper strips were unfolded, they were colorful and beautiful.</p>
<p>The carnival lasts for about two months. During the event, tourists are like weaving and many are in costume. Most people hold paper scraps in their hands and compete to throw them at friends or beautiful women. When the paper scraps are exhausted, they can be bought at the venue. Entrance tickets are sold at the entrance of the venue.</p>
<p>The equipment in the venue displays various items, like an expo.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese business in the Philippines has always been prosperous. This time, Mayor Wu convened leaders from all walks of life to discuss promoting national goods in the Philippines. I have a few points to offer.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of clothing, domestic serge, spun silk, rayon, and summer domestic women's clothing should be selected, such as the products of Mei Ya, Sanyou, Zhanghua, and other factories.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of food, domestic canned food, candy, biscuits, and preserved plums should be selected, such as the products of Guanshengyuan, Taikang, and Taifeng.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of housing, domestically made beds, tables, chairs, mirrors, bottles, and bedding should be selected.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of transportation, domestically made bicycles, carriages, and cars should be selected. Rickshaws do not need to be transported because the Philippine government prohibits the use of rickshaws. (Ji Ping's note: Before the September 18th Incident, the Liaoning Mortar Factory had self-made many trucks. After the fall of the four provinces, there were no factories in China that continued to make them. (It is regrettable to say this.)</p>
<p>(5) In terms of sports, domestically made sports equipment should be selected, such as the products of the China Standard Company.</p>
<p>(6) In terms of entertainment, domestically made films and musical instruments should be selected, such as the products of the Star and United Film Companies.</p>
<p>The objects to be transported should be as complete as possible. After the closing of the meeting in the future, these objects can be set up as a national goods exhibition hall in the local Chamber of Commerce to be a permanent asset and a memorial. Each item can be sold in the Philippines. This is not a one-time promotion, but a permanent promotion. What do you think of the suggestion to the enthusiastic people involved in trade in Southeast Asia?</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Rise of Domestically Produced Velvet <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Huajin</p>
<p>Silk fabrics can originally be divided into three major categories: silk, satin, and velvet. This is how they are classified in all countries, and also how customs classifies silk fabrics. China originally produced all three of these types of silk fabrics. However, only a type of velvet called Zhang velvet was produced. After the 1911 Revolution, imported Western velvet, with its diverse patterns and vibrant colors, became popular. As a result, Zhang velvet gradually declined, and almost no one wore it anymore. Furthermore, very little of it was produced. The reason for its decline was entirely due to a lack of innovation and adherence to outdated methods. Consumers became tired of it over time, and no one cared about it. Moreover, manufacturers failed to improve their technology and equipment, or to imitate Western velvet. Consequently, imported velvet sold well in China, and there was no way to reclaim the economic benefits. The price of imported velvet was as high as ten or more yuan per foot, with a minimum of about one yuan per foot. The extent of this economic drain was unparalleled.</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic silk factories have produced a wide variety of silk and satin products, with many improvements. For example, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory was able to weave high-quality qisha (fine silk gauze) as early as six or seven years ago. However, it was not until this year that silk velvet was produced. This year, several types of domestically produced velvet have become popular in the silk and satin market, such as Yulian Velvet, Meihua Velvet, and Mali Velvet. This is undoubtedly due to the dedicated research of factories like Meiya. In Europe and the United States, velvet is woven two pieces at a time, connected together, and then automatically cut apart by a knife on the machine. However, this type of machinery is extremely expensive, and China does not yet have it, so other methods are used to manufacture velvet. The quality and style of the manufactured velvet is not only similar to that of imported products, but the patterns and colors are also more fashionable and suited to the tastes of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>There is no limit to technology. As long as someone is willing to research and work hard, they will naturally reap the rewards. Domestically produced velvet has now been successfully developed, and many Chinese people are buying it. At the same time, the sales of imported velvet will naturally decrease significantly. This is because the selling price of domestic velvet is only about 30-40% of the selling price of imported velvet, and the quality is the same. Why would Chinese people not want to buy domestic products? Therefore, I believe that to promote domestic goods, manufacturers should first improve the quality and reduce the price, so as to achieve the goal. Forcing people to buy inferior and expensive domestic goods is certainly not a realistic approach.</p>
<p>News About Domestic Goods</p>
<h3 id="e208">Domestic Goods in Nanjing <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>㈠ Peddlers and Stall Vendors Prohibited from Selling Foreign Goods</p>
<p>㈡ Barbershops and Cosmetics Must Use Domestic Goods</p>
<p>㈢ National Exhibition Concluded with Excellent Results</p>
<p>Mayor Shi Hengqing of Nanjing is very pragmatic in promoting domestic goods, so the results of promoting domestic goods in Nanjing are very good. The Nanjing Chinese National Goods Company, founded by Mayor Shi, has also been thriving since its opening on Double Ten Day (October 10th), which shows that people in the capital have a considerable understanding of promoting domestic goods. As a result, the atmosphere of using domestic goods is very strong!</p>
<p>Recently, Mayor Shi believed that not only stores should promote domestic goods, but also peddlers and stall vendors. Coincidentally, the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau is handling the registration of peddlers at the wharf, the Nanjing Public Works Bureau is also handling the registration of stall vendors in the Confucius Temple market, and the Nanjing Health Office is handling the registration of food peddlers. Therefore, Mayor Shi specially instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Health Office to require these registered peddlers and stall vendors to sell domestic goods. The relevant bureaus will issue permits only to those who sell domestic goods. If they sell foreign goods, their registration will be immediately cancelled and they will be prohibited from doing business. On the surface, this may seem insignificant. However, if we examine it closely, almost all Eastern goods are sold by these peddlers and stall vendors. Now that Mayor Shi prohibits peddlers and stall vendors from selling foreign goods, the economic losses that can be recovered are indeed considerable. Secondly, the Capital New Life Movement Promotion Association recently noted that the number of imported foreign cosmetics each year is very large. In order to reverse this economic drain, it specially consulted with the Social Affairs Bureau to inform all barbershops in the city that they must use domestic perfumes, cologne, creams, hair tonics, and other cosmetics in the future, and are not allowed to privately purchase foreign goods. In addition, many slogans promoting domestic goods have been made and hung in barbershops to attract the attention of people getting haircuts.</p>
<p>The Capital National Goods Exhibition, organized by more than 160 national goods merchants from Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, opened on the 20th of last month in the outdoor garden of the Sixiangqiao Great World Amusement Park. It has been going on for a month, so the association closed it down a few days ago. The remaining goods will be partly transported back to the main factory and partly transferred to Wuhu to participate in the exhibition. According to the person in charge of the association, the results of the exhibition were excellent. The revenue from the goods in one month reached more than 200,000 yuan, which is very rare in the current economic downturn!</p>

<p>— Diyin</p>
<p>Chapter One The Mad Taoist Sings the "Good For Nothing Song," Zhen Shiyin Explains the Patriotic Words</p>
<p>It is said that one day, Zhen Shiyin hobbled down the street with a cane, intending to buy some daily necessities for his wife, Feng. Suddenly, he saw a lame Taoist coming from the other side, crazy and unkempt, wearing hemp shoes and a tattered robe, chanting a few lines of verse:</p>
<p>[Chinese people only know that foreign goods are good, they have forgotten about domestic clothing! Dafeng dyeing and weaving has a variety of patterns, Wuhe and Jinglun underwear are good;</p>
<p>Chinese people only know that foreign goods are good, they have forgotten about domestic food! Tiaowei MSG and Weimu, beer and soda are delicious;</p>
<p>Chinese people only know that foreign goods are good, they have forgotten about domestic utensils! Enamel, bakelite, celluloid, and porcelain items are popular;</p>
<p>Chinese people only know that foreign goods are good, they have forgotten about domestic supplies! Yixin toothbrushes and Huasheng fans, Invincible tooth powder is so good;</p>
<p>Chinese people only know that foreign goods are good, they have forgotten about domestic products! Just to mention a few, please remember them, try them and see if they are good?]</p>
<p>Shiyin heard this and stepped forward, saying, "What are you saying, only hearing 'good for nothing, good for nothing'?" The Taoist laughed and said, "If you really heard the words 'good for nothing', then you are considered to understand! You know that our compatriots only think that foreign goods look good, but they don't know that domestic goods are also really good now. My song is called the 'Good For Nothing Song'." As soon as Shiyin heard this, he immediately understood. He laughed and said, "Wait! How about I annotate your 'Good For Nothing Song'?" The Taoist laughed and said, "My song is just a brief overview, please explain." Shiyin then said, "Most Chinese people hold the principle of 'nothing but foreign', thinking that foreign goods must be cheap and good. In fact, this view is extremely absurd! Look at the current domestic factories, their products are excellent and the prices are low. In terms of clothing, the dyeing and weaving products of Dafeng and Dingxin, and the underwear of Wuhe and Jinglun are all well-known. In terms of food, beer, soda, and seasonings are all superior to imported products. Daily necessities include the enamel of the Zhonghua Factory's Lique brand, the bakelite of the Yaguang Factory, and other utensils, the mosquito coils of Samsung and Wudi brands, the electric fans of Huasheng Factory, the light bulbs of Yapuer Factory, the celluloid children's toys of Da Zhonghua Factory, and the straw hats and felt hats of Huafu, the Chinese and American cigarettes. There are truly too many to mention. As for the Sanyou Society, its products are numerous and praised by everyone, so there is no need to elaborate. Good! Think about it: you refuse to use good domestic goods and insist on using things from overseas foreigners, is that not strange? It is truly [recognizing a foreign land as your hometown, how absurd! In the end, you are all making wedding clothes for others!] The mad lame Taoist heard this and clapped his hands, laughing loudly, "Well explained, well explained!" Shiyin then said, "Let's go!" He drifted away with the mad Taoist, causing a commotion in the neighborhood. These words have a point to teach: farmers, workers, merchants, and scholars, everyone is awakened; clothing, food, housing, and transportation, everything is complete. After all, did the mad Taoist lead Shiyin to Shanghai to visit major domestic factories and national goods companies, or did he go to Nanyang to investigate the business of overseas Chinese? There is no explanation in the following text. This chapter is:</p>

<p>The 22-1 Shanghai Team Was Easily Defeated</p>
<p>The Cold Weather and Small Field Prevented Them from Fully Displaying Their Talents</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Original Ship Departed for the Philippines at 7 PM Last Night <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The 15 members of the American professional baseball championship team, including baseball king Babe Ruth, arrived here yesterday morning at 9 AM on the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Canada. At one point, the welcomers were like madmen. In the afternoon at 2:30 PM, at the invitation of the American Amateur Baseball Association of this port, they held an exhibition match at Shen Garden against the local amateur Mailing and Japanese mixed team. Although tickets were sold for 2 yuan, 3 yuan, and 5 yuan, there were still over a thousand Chinese and foreign people who came to watch, drawn by the reputation.

<p>However, due to the strong north wind and sudden cold weather, the players could not display their skills, and the performance was not amazing. The audience also complained endlessly. Although the Shanghai team was composed of elite players, it was no match for the American team. The American team played casually and won 22-1. The one point scored by the Shanghai team was also a gift from the American team. The team left Shanghai on the original ship at 7 PM last night to go to the Philippines.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Record of the Shen Garden Performance <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The players from both teams arrived at the field around 2 PM. Some Chinese and foreign people specially bought new baseballs and asked the American team players to sign them as souvenirs. They were so busy that they could hardly keep up. Baseball king Babe Ruth was a man of great stature. Although his appearance was fearsome, his conversations and actions were quite humorous. Fox, the new home run king nicknamed Babe Ruth II, was unable to play due to an ankle injury.</p>
<p>Before the start of the game, there were demonstrations of fielding and batting. Any balls hit by the American team that flew over the wire mesh and landed in the stands were snatched by the audience as valuable souvenirs. At one point, more than ten were snatched. This was due to the defense area being too small to be suitable for baseball games. If one exerted too much effort, the ball would definitely go out of bounds. Furthermore, the American team's skills were not fully displayed. Therefore, the game was played casually and there was little excitement. However, the Shanghai team tried their best to attack and defend, but they were still unable to compete.</p>
<p>The American team first performed a demonstration of barehanded fielding. Each person made a gesture of catching and throwing the ball with empty hands. The situation was humorous and earned a lot of applause. The game started at 2:30 PM and lasted nine innings, ending at 4:30 PM. As a result, the American team won 22-1. The Shanghai team allowed the American players to play as they pleased.</p>
<p>The Shanghai team used three pitchers. The first was Mailing's Maris, who had excellent arm strength and deep skill. The American players were at a loss in the first three innings, and were struck out every time. The American team first scored two points in the top of the fourth inning. In the top of the fifth inning, many mistakes were made. High balls and low balls were repeatedly missed, and the situation became chaotic and unmanageable. The Americans scored as many as eleven points. Later, because of his own mistakes, he was taken out of the game. After this inning, Amen Quello was called in as pitcher. He was unremarkable. In the top of the eighth inning, Liepeng was called in. This person was the amateur team's pitcher and the best pitcher in Shanghai. However, because he had not practiced for a long time, his pitches were mostly wild, and the competition became even more dull. The American players were just going through the motions. The scores for each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>American Team 0 0 0 2 11 4 0 5 0 | 22 points</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)</p>
<p>Shanghai Team 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 | 1 point</p>

<p>World baseball home run king Babe Ruth was born forty years ago in the city of Baltimore on the American Atlantic coast, near the capital. The city is a desolate little street near the banks of the Baltimore River. Ruth's family was very poor and lived in a dark shack. From a young age, he and his companions played baseball every day. As he grew older, he became particularly interested in baseball. At that time, American baseball games were not as popular as they are now, and there were even fewer youth baseball teams. Moreover, at that time, he was in dire economic straits and had no money to buy a baseball. Therefore, Weiss picked up a tennis ball that others had discarded, and used a wooden hammer as a bat. When there were few horse-drawn carriages on the street, he and some other children played baseball. Because the sports equipment was not complete, the ball could not be thrown far. Each game could not achieve the desired results. However, Ruth was physically strong and stronger than other children, and often hit the ball very far, damaging the glass of nearby fruit shops and grocery stores. The shopkeepers of nearby stores were furious and ordered their clerks to prevent the game every day. Ruth and other children were very afraid of the police. When they saw the police coming, they all ran away. Ruth's parents were very stubborn and wanted Ruth to become a pastor in the future. They worried about Ruth's wandering every day, so they entrusted a young pastor named I. Full group photo of the American baseball team (photo by Zhu Shunlin)</p>
<p>Kilbardi took Ruth to the Skull Religious Academy. One day, Ruth cried bitterly. The reason was not because he was separated from his family, but because the young people on the street could no longer play baseball with him. Kilbardi was very kind and allowed Ruth to exercise freely, so he joined the academy's sports department. Ruth was overjoyed and very happy. Ruth gradually learned to pitch, catch, infield, and outfield. At the age of sixteen, he could throw fast balls with his left hand. Because he was a pitcher, the talented Ruth became even more determined, and his skills improved rapidly. In less than a year, he was hired by the Boston American Supreme Red Inks baseball team as a pitcher. Unfortunately, he injured his left shoulder in that team, so he changed from pitcher to outfielder and specialized in various batting methods. This was the biggest reason for Ruth becoming the world home run king. Ruth has been living on the baseball field for nineteen years from 1915 to the present. His highest annual salary reached 120,000 US dollars. He has played in more than 2,790 games and scored an amazing 708 home runs, making him the world's home run champion. Because of Ruth on this American professional baseball team, audiences flocked to watch their games whether they were in Europe, America, or Japan. His power to attract crowds was greater than that of a generation of emperors.</p>

<p>World baseball king Babe Ruth is from Baltimore, USA, born on February 7, 1894. He is forty years old this year. He first joined the Baltimore Baseball Club as a pitcher, starting his career as a professional baseball player. At that time, Babe was still studying at an industrial school. In 1914, at the age of twenty, he joined the Boston baseball league team in the United States as a pitcher. In 1916, he served as both pitcher and outfielder. In 1920, he joined the New York Yankees for a price of 125,000 US dollars. Ruth's highest salary reached 80,000 US dollars per season. Ruth has been a member of the New York Yankees ever since.</p>
<p>Babe Ruth is the most famous player in American baseball and an idol in the American baseball world. He is one of the most attractive people to spectators. In his lifetime, he has created a total of 708 home runs in the American Baseball League and 15 home runs in the World Baseball Championship. He set a record of more than 50 home runs in four years. In 1927, he even set an unprecedented record of 60 home runs. Ruth is six feet two inches tall and weighs 230 pounds. The number of home runs he has created over the years is listed below:</p>

<p>In the final scene of the Group A game, Mailing faced John. For the first ten minutes of the game, the situation was even and neither side could gain the upper hand. Afterwards, Mailing's general displayed his magical power. Blin Eyou scored every time he shot, and Mailing took the lead. John still followed closely, trailing by only five points, 16-21, in the first half. In the second half, Mailing became more and more energetic, while John did the opposite. In addition, the guard Zhang Yuchun was sent off, and the situation became even more unmanageable. As a result, Mailing won 55-26, achieving a record of four wins in four games.</p>

<p>In the Xieling Cup pharmacy football match, France and China-France played yesterday morning at the Public Stadium. The referee was He Chunhui. France played with ten players in the first half, and China-France took the opportunity to go deep, and the ball often hovered in the French hinterland. Unfortunately, except for the center forward, the China-France forwards had no legs, and they lost a good chance without scoring a goal. In the second half, Zhu Weichen, the backbone of France, joined the team, and the spirit was greatly boosted. China-France was penalized twice, but France did not hit either of the two penalty kicks, which can be said to be unlucky. Later, center forward Liu Shuangxi scored a goal, but the French rear guard was not careful and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was scored by China-France center forward Zhu Shengsheng. Afterwards, although France launched many fierce attacks, China-France had a strong defense, and the good generals Xu Xibiao, Xu Zhensheng and Hu Zhenwen guarded the central defense line fortress, and were able to maintain a 1-1 draw. Last Saturday, the result of the match between Wuzhou and Huayang was 2-0. The next day's report stated that it was 4-0, which was a typo by the association and is hereby corrected. The results of the matches that each team has played are listed below:</p>

<p>▲Condolences from the Chinese PEN Club</p>
<p>"PEN Club" is the Chinese translation of (P.E.N. Club). It was initiated in 1921 by an American female writer, Mrs. Dawson Scott, as a writers' dinner party in London. Participants included poets, playwrights, editors, essayists, and novelists. Within a few years, it expanded into an international writers' association, with 34 member countries and 52 branches in various cities. In China, in 1930, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Hu Shi, Zeng Mengpu, Ye Gongchao, Zong Baihua, Xu Zhimo, Xie Shou Kang, Guo Youshou, Zheng Zhenduo, Ge Gongzhen, Lin Yutang, Shao Xunmei, and others initiated the establishment of a branch in Shanghai. One of the PEN Club's missions is that "PEN Club members should make good use of their influence to seek the realization of mutual understanding and respect between nations." The PEN Club's progress over the past decade has been remarkable, and we cannot but thank Mrs. Dawson Scott for her continuous efforts. Therefore, she is called "the Mother of the PEN Club." Unfortunately, Mrs. Scott passed away last month. PEN Clubs in various countries around the world are deeply saddened and have sent telegrams to the London headquarters to express their condolences. It is reported that the Chinese branch of the PEN Club has instructed Guo Zixiong, a member in England, to go and express condolences.</p>

<p>▲Mayor Wu and Director Yang Personally Preside</p>
<p>Zhaohe Middle School, which was established to commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising, held its 15th anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising and the first anniversary of the school yesterday. The entire day was filled with lively activities. The highlights are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Attendees: School board members Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu; Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan; Municipal Party Representative Yu Zhongbiao; Zeng Zesheng, Wen Yiru, Lu Jie, Wu Depan, etc. from the Security Department, totaling more than 500 people. They were warmly received by the school principal Jia Botao and Zhu Jiarang, Yao Sufang, etc.</p>
<p>▲Inspection: At 9:00 AM, Mayor Wu and Director Yang arrived together on time, welcomed by the music of the police garrison headquarters. Then Director Pan Gongzhan also arrived. There were many guests, so the inspection began. The vanguard was the military band of the police garrison headquarters, followed by the student army and then the Boy Scouts, all neatly dressed and with a strong military appearance. Lianhua Yihua Company filmed the event.</p>
<p>▲Meeting: Then the Boy Scouts performed a fire drill with fire extinguishers from Pushi Industrial Company and inspected internal affairs, including classrooms and bedrooms. Wu, Yang, Pan, and others personally inspected them. Because the school implemented militarization, it was neat and simple, resembling a model barracks. At 10:30 AM, the meeting officially began. Chairman Yang Hu respectfully read the will and presented flowers. Then he reported on the Zhaohe Uprising. Then Mayor Wu delivered a speech in his capacity as chairman, and Director Pan Gongzhan of the Education Bureau gave a speech. Finally, Principal Jia gave a speech of thanks.</p>
<p>▲Speeches by Wu and Pan: The mayor's speech briefly stated that the Zhaohe Uprising was the most glorious page in the history of the revolution, which can promote the completion of the revolution and the unity of the party. Therefore, we should use various methods to commemorate and promote it. The establishment of this school is to use the spirit of the martyrs to cultivate students, so that the students of this school not only gain knowledge but also can contribute the spirit of the martyrs to society. Director Pan briefly stated that the Zhaohe Uprising was the harbinger of the National Revolution. However, the work of the Kuomintang now is to overthrow imperialism, which requires the power of the entire nation and youth. The revolutionary atmosphere of Zhaohe Middle School is stronger than other schools. It is hoped that students will strengthen their physical strength, intelligence, and morality in preparation.</p>
<p>▲Grand Entertainment Performance: At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, there was a sports meet, at 6:30 PM a parents' meeting, and at 8:00 PM an entertainment performance.

A commemorative special issue was published by the Social Evening News and was distributed with the newspaper yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Municipal Education Bureau Forbids the Filming of Supernatural and Strange Films <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>▲Request the Central Government to Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>▲Send Bureau Staff to Conduct Thorough Searches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has always paid close attention to assisting the Central Government in inspecting films. Recently, the bureau has received reports from various sources that many film companies in the city are secretly filming supernatural and strange films, such as "Lu Chunyang Plays Three Times with Bai Mudan" and "Riot in the Crystal Palace," which are all promoting superstition and have a significant impact on the nation and society. In addition to reporting to the Central Government for close attention, the bureau also yesterday</p>
<p>instructed all film companies to comply. The original order is as follows: It has been found that the production of supernatural and strange films has long been prohibited. However, in order to seek profit, some film merchants have not hesitated to circumvent the laws and still secretly film them from time to time, which is a violation of the ban. The bureau has reported this several times and forwarded it to the Central Film Inspection Committee for attention. The Film Inspection Law promulgated by the Legislative Yuan strictly restricts films from taking superstition and supernatural subjects as themes. Shanghai is the center of the country's film industry, and the bureau's duty lies in urging its subordinates to conduct thorough searches and confiscate and destroy any supernatural and strange films to uphold the law and prevent their spread. All film production companies should also understand the government's painstaking efforts to protect the domestic film industry. If any film studio is borrowed to film such films, they should refuse or secretly report it to the bureau without any hesitation.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Flattering Smiles Meet the Lamp's Glow, Haggard Hunger Drives on, Powdered Faces Learn to Be Charming</p>
<p>Auntie Hu initially blushed, then turned into a smile, saying, "I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying, with the young lady right here, it's embarrassing for you to say such things." As she spoke, she reached out and pulled Yueying inside, laughing, "Come in, don't just stand there half in and half out. You're just attracting attention." After being pulled inside by her, Yueying immediately sat down on a square stool in the corner by the wall. There was a small two-drawer table here, with paper, cigarettes, matches, teacups, torn paper, pen and ink, and other things scattered on top. There were also two things that the poor couldn't bear to look at: a large cornbread and a plate of stir-fried leeks with shredded meat. Moreover, there was a pair of chopsticks on the plate, as if it were prepared for someone to eat. Auntie Hu smelled the aroma and had already swallowed her saliva. She pinched off a small piece of cornbread, as if joking, and put it in her mouth to chew. Little Ji ignored her and asked, "What kind of powder is she wearing on her face?" He nodded his chin towards Yueying's face. Auntie Hu said, "We don't have rouge and powder in our house. This is a little bit of leftover tooth powder that I let her put on." Little Ji said, "Auntie Hu, this is freshly baked cornbread, is it delicious?" Auntie Hu pinched off another small piece and laughed, "It's good! Are you offering it to me?" Little Ji said, "What's this? I'll treat both of you. But there's one condition, you have to agree to do one thing for me. We have female guests here. I'll go borrow some rouge and powder and you and this young lady can doll yourselves up a bit. Maybe I can even borrow a dress..." Yueying lowered her head and rushed to say, "I won't!" Little Ji didn't look at her, but looked at Auntie Hu. Auntie Hu said, "Just this little piece of cornbread, you're treating it like it's so important." Little Ji said, "Don't rush, since I'm treating you two, of course I'll let you two eat your fill. I have more." As he spoke, he took out a cornbread from a small basket under his bed and a can of pickled mustard tuber that was already opened, with half of it still inside. He laughed, "There's hot tea in the pot on the table, pour it yourself. I'm going to borrow some things." As he said this, he darted away in a flash. (82)</p>
<h3 id="e241">Street Artists <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Street artists are not from art schools, let alone studying at some academy in Paris. They don't know what is called art for art's sake, let alone what is called culture. But they have a good ability to create images.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Snippets <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— (A' Yuan)</p>
<p>There is a saying in the Suzhou and Shanghai area: "Blowing cowhide." Pi (皮, "hide") is a euphemistic representation of a vulgar word, although slightly more elegant, it is not really understandable. I think that in the future, when writing articles and wanting to quote this phrase, it can be rewritten as "Comparing a mouse to an ox," which is more humorous and unconventional. This is because the pronunciation of "blowing" (吹) and "mouse" (鼠) are similar in the Suzhou and Shanghai dialect; and using the smallness of a mouse to compare with the largeness of an ox still retains the original meaning of self-aggrandizement.</p>
<p>Street artists create images, not using plaster, nor do they use knives for carving. All that street artists have is a ball of colorful cooked flour. Their tools are a bamboo sliver, a broken small wooden comb with no more than ten teeth, and a ball of old cotton soaked in vegetable oil.</p>
<p>The ten clumsy and rough fingers of the street artist can create delicate human figures. They can all use oily fingers and the strength of a bamboo sliver to knead and sculpt the colorful cooked flour into different images. Guanyin Bodhisattva, Ji Gong the Monk, Indian Asan, foreign women, as well as clam spirits and silk factory girls, can all be sculpted vividly and lifelike.</p>
<p>Street artists are wanderers on the streets, but they also rely on their skills to live. Ji Gong the Monk sells for ten coppers, the clam spirit sells for sixteen coppers. Although their works are not taken to Zhibo or salons for promotion and exhibition, the street artists are perfectly aligned with the saying "art for life."</p>
<p>Of course, Ji Gong the Monk, Guanyin Bodhisattva, and the like are too naive and humble, not as popular as the statues of historical figures created by great artists, but I think this is a faithful representation of the culture of the common people in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Moving from Old Houses to New Villages <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>In recent years, general real estate developers in Shanghai have felt that the names of the houses they used to build, such as "fang" (坊) and "li" (里), are somewhat rigid and fail to attract people's attention. Therefore, many newly built houses have been renamed "villages" (村) or "villas" (别墅), hoping to change people's perceptions. In reality, it is still the same wine in a new bottle.</p>
<p>The houses in the alleyways of the li and fang are all the same, which is really annoying. The air is bad, the light is bad, and the construction of the houses is simple and rigid. Although some have become slightly more modern recently, the rent is at least one or two hundred yuan per month, or at least seven or eight thousand yuan. If you are not afraid of the high rent and are willing to live in an environment with polluted air, its organization and spirit are extremely scattered. It can be said that there is no organization at all, except when opposing rent increases by the landlord.</p>
<p>New villages are different. They are a sound and concrete group. The house style and roads, flower gardens, guards, water and electricity, fire protection, cleaning, and elementary schools, assembly halls, etc., are all carefully designed by experts, and the facilities are adapted to local conditions to ensure that the families living in the village have a very comfortable life. This kind of life is definitely not something that can be dreamed of in the messy alleyway houses in the city.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, the Rose Garden New Village has appeared in Shanghai. We often curse the tenants living in the old-fashioned alleyway houses in the li and fang. If you are determined to try the real new village life, it is better to join the Rose Garden New Village and work together. They are adopting the nature of a cooperative to manage the new village's business. Everything in the village is done according to the principles and spirit of cooperation. Mutual assistance in vigilance, mutual support in illness, mutual respect and mutual assistance are indeed a special force in the New Life Movement. They are definitely not like the old-fashioned alleyway houses where people treat each other like people from Yue treating people from Qin, indifferent to each other's prosperity or decline, and each minding their own business.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Rainbow Clouds Song <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua, living in poverty in Beiping, has recently had a biography written about her by famous figures, and funds have been raised to maintain her life, attracting attention. According to reports, when Sai Jinhua first entered the brothel, she hung a plaque that read "Fu Caiyun." After being housed in a golden house by Hong Zhuangyuan (Hong Jun), she went to Germany with him. After Hong died, she returned to the brothel and changed her name to Sai Jinhua. During the Gengzi Incident (Boxer Rebellion), because of her old friendship with the German commander Waldersee, she persuaded him to restrain his subordinates, protecting many lives and properties, and people were grateful for her virtue, respectfully calling her "Second Master Sai." Her power and influence were once so great, but now she is so destitute, one cannot help but feel the lament of a beauty in her twilight years. Fan Fanshan Fangbo and Wang Biyun Xiaolian both wrote Rainbow Clouds Songs at that time. Fan's work was printed and widely recited, while Wang's work was not easily shown to others, and few knew about it. Choucheng is from the same hometown as Wang and has kinship ties. He was shown it in the past, and I cherish the remaining manuscripts. I am publishing them here specifically for reference.</p>
<p>(Rainbow Clouds Song has an introduction) During my time in Tianjin, I heard the name of Sai Jinhua. During my holidays, I went to see her with my friends. I arrived while she was still doing her morning makeup, and she came out after a long delay. As soon as she came out, the whole room came alive. The six guests in the room all received her perfect attention. Though old, she was still as beautiful as a young girl, truly a rare beauty. In the past, a certain minister, who was sent to Germany, had a concubine named Caiyun, who was known for her beauty. The German Empress loved her and took a small photo with her. The Empress was the son of Queen Victoria of England, who was also beautiful. The high favor shook Europe, and the matter spread overseas. Caiyun was originally a singer in Suzhou. After the minister died, she was restless and returned to the brothel, and changed her name to Sai Jinhua. I could not help but feel moved, and I imitated the Changqing style to write this poem, not only to record the rare beauty and weave in current affairs, but also to warn future generations.</p>
<p>Leaving the brothel and moving the orchid boat, the boat girl's slender hands skillfully stir the soup, the flower fragrance is so pleasant, the mountain scenery across the bank is so beautiful, there is an appointment with the neighboring girl to play, the young master sends a poem while traveling, the morning comb is decorated with a jade hairpin, the clever maid cheers and knows the trick. The child was born on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and Caiyun holds up the moonlit galaxy. The small characters are picked up, the mother pities, only allowing a fairy to ride in the future. Born beautiful and living in Hengtang, sitting in front of the flowers every day, competing for beauty, still charming in her youth, her name fragrant everywhere in the spring breeze, hearing her name but wanting to know her face, who knew that seeing her would break the heart, a guest in the Golden Palace before ten thousand miles, a jade flute girl on the Three Lives Stone. The embroidered carriage should be welcomed early, but Longgang still needs to be expressed, the wife is easy to find because of love, the ministers dare not lightly abandon the etiquette, suffering the secret friends to hide the beauty, the golden house secretly builds the magpie bridge, it is expected that the zither will not be in tune, measuring her embrace, a pitiful night. In the blink of an eye, another year, leaving the hometown trees, flying together to Yantai, the husband waits for the dawn, the maid smokes incense in the painted pavilion, the king chooses an envoy to be gentle, the phoenix decree is sent, the emperor sings the song, singing far away for thirty thousand miles, and the boudoir turns into the worry of the concubine, but teaching the little wife to follow, good at learning from the lady, do not be careless. A new purple haze pendant is given as a special gift, and the crows fly into the blue phoenix team, the traveling knight with a curly beard recognizes Li Lang and Hong Fu Mei. Translating the barbarian's tongue, she is skilled in the art of Kucha in a foreign country, the flower branches are only displayed in Berlin, and the pear orchard sings the ballad of Luo Fu. The fairy of the Jade Palace loves her gracefulness, the doctor welcomes her with incense, cunningly concealing the majesty of the phoenix, the crystal clear glass illuminates the shadow of the swan, from then on, her demeanor spreads overseas, and a new chapter opens with the fortunate journey of the star carriage, the star carriage returns to the imperial capital, buying a map for a thousand gold, the cunning merchant deceives, turning an inch of mountain and river into a thousand miles. The old friend is the same in the past, but the hand turns repeatedly without end, and Shu Road changes everywhere, the human being is divided into the heart and the ghosts, but he is worried about sleeping in the rain, and the empty bed of the wanton woman is difficult to guard alone, singing loudly of the red phoenix coming in the clouds, whispering about the Qin Palace in the flower bed. Nothing is left but a long sorrow, thirst quenches the garden, Yan Zi does not live in Guan Panpan, the old dream warms in the light of the lantern, the new knowledge is made by the scholar, the light song and slow dance are still happy, changing the feathers and moving the palace. All things rise and fall, the wheels turn, a dream is absurd, the bananas are overturned, and suddenly the sacred fire amazes the god of the barbarian clothes, and the yellow turban in the river in competition to the shores bow to Zhang Jiao, the drums of the confederation shake the earth, the orioles and flowers in the rapids follow the wind, a general flies from outside the sky, and the gold hairpin is reunited, the fine horse on the seven-treasure carved saddle, the nine-hua brocade is inhabited by a pair of mandarin ducks. The two palaces are hunted in the west, the sound of the market is broken, the upper kingdom's clothes are covered in charcoal, the jade ring prince weeps on the roadside, and the golden fish is taken by the courtier. The locked-bone Bodhisattva is heartbroken, and begs for mercy from the general every time, the prime minister gives peace and倾 pours out the treasury, and the barbarians are full of desire to prepare their whips, the galloping wheels are about to leave, whispering farewell, the pearl tears fall lightly, the smoke of the beacon is scattered, the chariot returns to the capital, and the prosperous atmosphere is still as before, the young heroes of Wuling indulge in extravagance, and a song of entanglement is innumerable. The beauty is changing people, and the old lady is still charming, filling the room with beautiful men for self-entertainment, allowing you to break your heart and ask about your failures, the white and tender skin is just grotesque, and the red face is abruptly cut off by the fish girl's blade, the wind and rain of jealousy darkens Chang'an, the iron-cast document is written in snow, and the back of the document shows from the clerk, the jujube village still relies on the joy of the song, the criminal court is easy to turn around, the evil sea is difficult to stir the rudder, the purple street is thick with spring songs, the flowers bloom and fall from Jiangnan. (This song was written in the year of Xin You, so the matters of remarrying Weissan and changing her name to Wei Zhao Lingfei, etc., are not included.)</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Indeed, the portrait does not tell us in such detail: it tells us of a large glass case, which is placed right below the portrait, and inside are all the clothes of the person in the painting: his Mongolian saddle, his exquisite hunting suit, his pure gold stirrups, all complete. What's missing is the living person and the living horse. According to my speculation, the author of that portrait must have based it on these real things, first drawing a shell, and then recalling the appearance and identity of the owner of these things, carefully adding them, and then piecing together this moving portrait.</p>
<p>There are also three things on the painting that have not been mentioned above. The first is a leather whip hanging on Qianlong's left hand; the second is a bow on his left hand; and the third is a quiver with several arrows inserted in it. These three things are also displayed in the same large glass case, so we can also appreciate them carefully. The leather whip is about three feet long, one end is braided with several leather straps like braids, which is used to drive the horses; the other end is a white jade handle, with two small holes drilled through it, and another silk ribbon is tied to it, so that the hand can be put into the silk ribbon, so that it can be swung at will. Looking at the arrows and bows, they are generally inlaid with white jade. I can't help but wonder if the arrowheads made of white jade can really be used for hunting? Perhaps these arrows are just decorations, and iron arrowheads are used instead when they are actually used. (192)</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Rise in Gold Prices in the Financial Market is Difficult to Sustain <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Pure gold rises, custom gold rises, market once soared</p>
<p>The exchange rate continued to be strong, but the result was a fall of 2.3 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, pure gold and custom gold continued to rise in the gold market. The upstream and downstream markets rose again. However, the bank's appetite had a lot of hidden selling intentions. The foreign exchange market was tight and then relaxed. As a result, it was inevitable that it would be high and then low, and it was even lower than the previous closing, which shows that the rise is difficult to sustain. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed that the UK and the US were flat, and the forward silver price in Montevideo rose instead. The exchange rate continued to fall, and the price of pure gold in London rose by another four and a half pence. People's confidence was revived, and the off-market preparatory trading opened, rising to 96.7 yuan. The central bank's listing was announced, the UK was flat and the US shrank by 1.875, the custom gold rose by another five cents, and the standard gold price rose to 1012 yuan. The morning opening was high and people's confidence was strong. After opening, demand exceeded supply, and the upstream market rose sharply. The bank's appetite was still blocked, taking advantage of the high prices to carry out supply activities, gradually falling back down. However, because the HSBC listing was announced, the UK was flat and the US shrank by 0.0625, the buyers were still willing to operate, and it took a lot of struggle. Later, because HSBC sold shillings and the central bank supplied US dollars, people's confidence slightly weakened and fell. However, there were many who maintained it after the low, hovering around six yuan at this time. The silver balance tax announced was still 6.75%. The British exchange rate was calculated at one shilling, five pence, six eight seven five. After this, the market situation was even flatter, the trading in the market was idle, and there was no change for a long time. As the bank continued to cut prices and sell, the foreign exchange market became tighter. Large households made some arbitrages, and the supply in the market exceeded demand, and the downward trend began, so that the trend was the most sluggish at noon. Unfavorable rumors such as the success of the Sino-British loan and the British expansion of currency circulation reappeared. The psychology of retail investors wavered, and the result was a rebound, which was really beyond expectations. Now the market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 996.8 yuan, up 2.4 yuan from the previous close. Fu'an, Dachangxiang, Zhaofengchang, Yifeng, and Yongjin rose to 8.5 yuan. HSBC came out with a January US dollar of half a yuan and 4.375 for matching. Fuxingyong, Zhentai, Dadecheng, and Wanxing sold contracts one after another, gradually falling. The central bank came out with a March US dollar of 33 yuan. HSBC blocked the current shilling at 4.375. Huabi blocked the January US dollar at half a yuan. People's confidence was unsustainable, Hengyu advanced and then withdrew, retreating to around six yuan. Although there was a spin, the central bank was willing to block the current US dollar at 34 yuan, and the selling continued to be strong. Yuan Yi and Hengxing sold to 5.5 yuan. Shanghai sold a February US dollar at 3.125. Fuyu, Fu'an, Tianfeng and other paid contracts, gradually rising to 6.5 yuan. Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, and Hengxing sold again, to 5.6 yuan. Yuan Maoyong and Dachangxiang advanced to 6.4 yuan. The silver balance tax announced was unchanged, and the market situation was extremely stable. Youli blocked the January shilling at 0.25. The sellers were still surging, and Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanchangyong and others sold to 5.3 yuan. Hongxing and Dayuan and others paid, rising to 6.2 yuan. Fuxingyong and Dingkang supplied, and Meifeng also blocked a February US dollar at 0.25, making it difficult to rise further. The trading in the market was normal, and there was a lot of spin. When Mcalley came out with a January US dollar at 5.625, the domestic market was very strong. The large household Wang arbitrage contracts, and the selling wind started at one time. Sheng Da, Hengxing, Hengtai, Chunyuanyong, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Hengyu and others sold contracts one after another, falling to four yuan. At this time, the large household Dafayong, Fuyu, and Tongfengheng paid contracts, still rising to 4.6 yuan. However, the atmosphere was not good, and rumors such as the success of the Sino-British loan and the British currency inflation reappeared. There were many floating contracts that could be closed, and the retail investors wavered. Although Tongfengheng and Fuyu advanced, they fell to 1.8 yuan because Hengxing, Tianfengyong, and Dalianbang Hengxingyuan and others continued to supply contracts. Yuan Maoyong, Yifengyong, and Ruixing and others had some buying appetites, gradually rising back to 2.5 yuan. The noon closing was 992.1 yuan. After the close, Dalianbang and Dachangshen and others sold slightly, still retreating to within two yuan. The highest price in half a day was 998.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 991.8 yuan, a fluctuation of 6.7 yuan. The result was that the previous closing fell by 2.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was about 20 yuan weaker than the central bank's standard gold price of 1012 yuan at the closing price, which was 5 yuan more than the previous closing. The book price for this month was 983 yuan, January was 992 yuan, and the morning water supplement was 983 yuan. The price of red gold was 994.8 yuan, which was still 2 yuan less than the gold price. The spot market situation was stable. Tianjin goods were about 3 yuan more, lacking transactions. The swap was posted by the more than one side at 8 yuan, which was also Yingfeng Heng posting 42 contracts to Yongli. All of these transactions were related to bank interest rates, and there was no trend to speak of. The posted price was actually the interest paid by the more than one side to the short side. December contracts were difficult to clear, except for public contracts, a total of 35 contracts remained, for a total of the short side Dafengheng, the long side Yongli Yifengyongda and Yong three companies.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was still quiet. In summary, Tongfengheng, Fuyu, Dachangxiang, Qingfayong, Tongchun, Ruixing, Fu'an, Dafashunhe and others were on the buying side, Fuchang, Yicheng, Yuan Yi, Dingtai, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Hongkangyong, Renfayong, Hengyu, Bingxing, Hengtai, Sheng Da, Hengxing, Tianfengyong, Hengxingyuan, Wanxing and others were on the selling side, Dafayong and Dadecheng went out first and then in, Tianfeng, Zhaofengchang, and Yifengyong went in first and then out, and Dalianbang and Wanxing did a total of about 700, and rolled out more than 200 contracts. Shunli did a total of more than 100, and rolled in dozens of contracts. Guangbang Sheng Da slightly went out, Hengxing entered dozens of contracts, and came out about 300. The total number of daily or delivered contracts was 26,474.</p>
<p>The long lineup for January futures includes Zhengchang with slightly less than 2900 contracts, Dachangshen with slightly more than 2500, Yuan Maoyong with slightly more than 1700, Changshengyong with slightly more than 1200, Tianfeng and Dadecheng with slightly more than 900 each, Fuxingyong and Dingtai with slightly more than 800 each, Shenkang, Bingxing, and Chunyuanyong with more than 700 each, Yuandayong and Wuchangxiang with slightly more than 600 each, Hengxing with slightly more than 500, Runchangyu, Hengxingyuan, Sheng Da, Shunmao, and Dacheng with more than 400 each, Qingfayong, Yisheng, Yongxiang, Yingxiang, and Changda with slightly more than 300 each, Yuankangxiang, Wanxing, Hengyu, and Houchangyong with more than 200 each.

The total number of chips is 26,047, with a total of 63 long parties and 57 short parties.</p>
<p>The public bill slightly increased again yesterday, because the spot number received spot goods, and on the one hand, the swap was posted. Therefore, the total number for December was difficult to clear and increased instead. Yesterday, Yingfeng Heng posted a swap to solve the 42 public bills, which will be received by the long side Yongli with 21 contracts today, Yifengyong with 14 contracts, and Dingkang with 7 contracts, for a total of 42 contracts. The closing price was 983 yuan.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the London tallies and New York silver prices remained unchanged. The forward silver price in Montreux rose by two points. The price of raw gold in London rose by four and a half pence, causing the pound against the dollar to fall by one point, the pound against the franc to shrink by twelve "pound-sounds," the dollar against the pound to fall by one point, and the dollar against the franc to remain unchanged. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices: the pound at one shilling, four pence, four three seven five; the dollar at thirty-three yuan, eight seven five. Compared to the previous close, the pound was tighter by zero six two five, and the dollar was tighter by one two five. The Central Bank announced its rates, with the pound unchanged and the dollar shrinking by one eight seven five. The Customs Gold Unit rose by five points. Chinese merchants felt quite good, so it tightened immediately after opening. However, domestic banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the overall trend was flat. The Central Bank also sold US dollars, and the banks consistently supplied them. The HSBC announced its rates, with the pound unchanged and the dollar falling by zero six two five, but the process gradually hardened. At this time, Chinese merchants remained calm, and banks also slightly profited from the low prices, which was still manageable. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. Afterwards, it was extremely quiet for a long time. Unexpectedly, the banks still had a rich appetite for selling and continued to sell. The news was unfavorable, and the process became even looser at noon. By the noon close, the recent selling prices were: the pound at one shilling, four pence, a half; the dollar at thirty-four yuan, zero six two five.

<p>Yesterday's foreign call loan market price remained the same as the day before, with both morning and afternoon markets at two jiao and five fen. However, the trend was not very tense, and there was a fear that it might return to its original state imperceptibly. Headed loans with added water had reached the former quiet and original attitude, accounting for only two or three fen. In call loan transactions, over three million two hundred thousand was transferred in the morning market, over forty thousand in new transactions, over fifty thousand in the afternoon market, and over thirty thousand in transactions at the Small General Association. In foreign mortgages redeemed, Chinese merchants redeemed four hundred thousand, and foreign merchants redeemed seven hundred thousand.

<p>Securities [L]</p>
<h3 id="e252">The Bond Market is Increasingly Stagnant <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>| Only a Difference of Five Fen to One Jiao |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was swirling and increasingly stagnant, as the reporter had predicted. Foreign call loans were not moving, the environment was stable, and news from the southwest was also good. The Fifth Plenary Session was not a problem. The bulls and bears were mutually watching, each wanting to see the changes after the meeting. Opinions differed, and each had their own goals. Therefore, transactions turned clear, and major players could not start. Transactions of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan were enough to move the market. The stagnation of the market was evident here. The swirling situation will likely last for several days. Yesterday's process: the opening was slightly firm by one or two jiao, and trading was surprisingly clear. The first six types were completely untouched, and the latter ones were also extremely quiet. Market prices were firm and flat. In the afternoon, the two sessions rose and fell, all swirling within a very small range of five fen to one jiao. Therefore, both sessions saw both rises and falls, mostly in the amount of five fen to one jiao. In summary, the market price results were slightly up by five fen to two and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was only 4,586,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot. The results of the previous rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Sinfeng Yanghang reported that yesterday (the 4th), the New York stock market turned upward, but the market atmosphere remained stagnant. Aviation and railway stocks were the strongest because the industry's news favored the bulls. Store stocks were expensive because Christmas was approaching and business was booming. Furthermore, the increase in steelwork also contributed significantly to the market. The bond market rose slightly with some differences. The new bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance have been fully subscribed, making government bonds very strong. Small exchange stocks showed mixed gains and losses. The dividend of the American Gas &amp; Electric Company on the small exchange was relaxed from 2% semi-annually to 2 jiao. Chicago wheat rose due to the firm corn and the poor weather reports from Argentina and Australia. The total transaction volume for the day was 950,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>After three consecutive days of declines in the yarn market, there was a slight reaction. In addition, raw cotton prices were trending upward, and buying interest rose slightly. However, the attitude of Tongcheng Company remained unchanged. Some people were extremely optimistic, but recently the sales of spot yarn have been relatively stagnant. The northern region is unable to do anything due to the cold and freezing weather.</p>

<p>The opening of the Shanghai Yarn market in the morning was tight because of several days of consecutive declines, which prompted profit-takers to cover. Buyers were particularly numerous, and the price of far-month contracts rose. However, it was heard that the sales of spot yarn were relatively sluggish, and people's confidence was not very good. As a result, this month fell by 5 jiao, and far months rose by 1, 2, and 3 jiao. In the afternoon, because raw cotton was firm, the market atmosphere was still good, but spot yarn sales were not smooth, and each month rose again by 1 and 2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,850 bales. It was found that Suncord sold 450 bales, Runcord 1,500 bales, Sincere 600 bales, Jinchang 600 bales, Changyu 600 bales, Yicheng 350 bales, Yichang 350 bales, and Yongchang 1,000 bales. Dafeng bought 900 bales, Dafu 600 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Changhe 2,600 bales, Deji 450 bales, Hengyi 300 bales, and Tongji 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales were relatively clear. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 600 bales for the day. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Swatow 85 Guangdong 135 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Changchun 95 Inland 100 Northern 10</p>
<p>Fujian 10 Jiangxi 5 Luzhou 25</p>
<p>The cotton market had fallen for three days, but today it reacted and rebounded strongly. Although American cotton was weak, Indian cotton continued to rise, causing bullish activity and buying. However, sellers, after the price increase, caused goods to come from various sources. According to some, the cotton-producing areas in all directions had abundant inventory, and there would be a steady stream of goods coming to Shanghai in the future. There were still many people who would sell when the price rose.</p>

<p>The opening of the Shanghai Cotton market in the morning was firm because there was a lack of sellers in the market, and Indian cotton rose by another two or three rupees. Buyers were more numerous, and each month rose by 2.5 jiao to 3.5 jiao. The market atmosphere remained stable and quiet in the afternoon. The trading floor was relatively dry, and there was short covering, so the market was tighter than the yarn market. Although it fell by 5 fen recently, far months rose by 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 79,800 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,600 dan, Yuanda 3,200 dan, Jinchang 1,900 dan, Junchang 1,200 dan, Suncord 1,300 dan, Yuande 1,200 dan, Yuan Yi 1,400 dan, Yongchang 3,200 dan, Zhenda 2,000 dan, Ruida 1,700 dan, and Runcord 2,500 dan.

<p>Tianjin News: Transactions of cotton yarn in this city have turned weak due to the severe cold weather and frozen rivers, making it inconvenient for ships to travel. The merchants feel these two reasons and have stopped operations. The market situation is relatively sluggish. The Zhan gang bought 30 bales of 16-count Eight Horse yarn at a price of 176 yuan. The Gaoyang gang bought 100 bales of 32-count Eight Horse yarn at a price of 221.5 yuan. The Xianghe gang bought 15 bales of 16-count Eight Horse yarn at a price of 175 yuan (all of the above include consolidated tax).

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to strength on Wall Street and reduced selling, but later became weak due to selling in the South. Spot prices were unchanged, near-term contracts fell by 1 point, and far-term contracts rose by 1 to 6 points. English cotton spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 3 or 4 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by Japanese merchants and brokers. Pingguole rose by 3 rupees, Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bairo Creek fell by 7.5 jiao.

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month showed an initial flat and then stable appearance. 洋麥 (Foreign Wheat) quotations: Chicago rebounded by about 24 jiao, and Canada rose by 8 fen to about 2 jiao. When pricing, the industry was not active, and market sentiment inside and outside the industry was not active. Therefore, the opening market appeared weak. Then, with 空抵補 (short covering), the factory slightly sold the distant months, with little other activity. As a result, the opening price gradually improved again. Until the afternoon opening, this month, due to the end of the lunar year accounting, customer transactions were quite settled. Temporary 空抵補 (short covering) was very strong, so the market improved again. According to the current situation, it will become a mutual deadlock, and there will be little huge ups and downs. As a result, this month to February each improved by 1.75, March and April rose by 2.5 fen, and May rose by 2.25 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e262">清靜沉寂 (Quiet and Silent) 期麥 (Future Wheat) <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the future wheat market, after the opening in both the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was generally stable and quiet. 洋麥 (Foreign Wheat) quotations, although rebounding by 8 fen to about 24 jiao, the lunar new year was approaching, and inside and outside the industry were mutually watching the trading. Therefore, changes were not active, and the amount of entering and leaving was also limited. The situation in each session in the afternoon was roughly the same. If there are no changes in 洋麥 (Foreign Wheat) later, it will tend to stagnate. As a result, this month and February each improved slightly by 1 fen, and the rest were unchanged. The spot wheat market was generally flat, with Shandong wheat opening at 3 yuan 9 jiao 4 fen, Mingguang wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen, and Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan 8 jiao. Fuxin sold 6,000 bags, Gaofeng sold 3,000 bags, Shenda sold 2,000 bags, and Xinda sold 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>▲ Chicago Grains: Domestically, the domestic position is sound, but there is a fear of imported wheat, and there is also a concern that it will replace corn. People are confused and do not know what to do. Therefore, when the price rises, it quickly leads to profit-taking, and when it reacts, re-entry is seen, and market traders are also confused. The closing was quite firm. また茂來氏 (also Maolai Shi) estimated winter wheat at a total of 52 million bushels, and 克郎魏而 (Klangweiler) estimated 46 million bushels.</p>

<p>| 期洋米 (Future Foreign Rice) Shouts High But Does Not Open |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation: initially, over 30,000 bags of new Saigon rice arrived, and whole batches of Siamese rice and Annam glutinous rice also arrived, and the market sentiment seemed to be trending soft. The city's进胃 (appetite) was also watching. Then, because the inland帮 (gang) appetite suddenly became greedy, and the Ningbo and Jiangbei gangs also inquired, the market turned from tired to standing. The whole city sent 3,000 bags of Saigon rice and 268 bags of Siamese rice to the inland. In addition to the Ningbo handling of over 1,000 bags of Saigon碎米 (broken rice), they also jointly handled 4,000 bags of Siamese碎米 (broken rice) with the inland帮 (gang). This city also went to Annam 粳 (Japonica) for 1,200 bags, and the market showed a vibrant atmosphere. In the future foreign rice trading, the merchants were actively selling in recent days. Yesterday, foreign merchants, because the production areas were firm, wanted to shout high by 5 fen. The importers only followed the previous day's定開 (fixed opening) price. The foreign merchants were unwilling to compromise, so they stopped selling. The city's circulating goods had decreased because a part had been transported out by various gangs, and a part was in the hands of囤戸 (hoarding households) who were unwilling to sell, because this year's rice harvest in Jiangzhe inland and Jiangbei was poor, and they intended to get a good price. 客秈 (Foreign Xiang Rice) still arrived旺 (booming). Nearly 10,000 bags continued to arrive yesterday, but the去胃 (sales) to the inland were very active. This city also had 应酬 (socializing). Yesterday, the Chongsha, Beiyang, Wuxi, and Changzhou gangs inquired. The market was very active, with over 6,000 bags opened for the day. Market conditions were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e264">河下米市 (Hexia Rice Market) Shows Swirling <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>(Hunan) Yesterday, a total of over 40 numbers of 各帮來源 (gang sources) arrived (totaling over 6,000 石 (dan)). The market color initially showed swirling, and market sentiment was still acceptable. Afterwards, when more goods arrived, changes arose, because the silver root was tight, making it difficult to have a long appetite. When the sales channel stagnated, it presented a situation that was 帶軟 (slightly soft) in the 定 (fixed). For example, prices of 厚粳 (thick japonica) and second-grade晚稻 (late rice) were revised slightly. 各花色 (various patterns) such as Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were still in a flat and tired situation.</p>
<p>(Hubei) Yesterday, 17 or 18 ships arrived from 各帮 (various gangs) in Hexia. The sales of 白粳 (white japonica) in the market were good in the morning, but turned stagnant in the afternoon.羊杜尖 (Yang Du tips) and 早薄稻 (early thin rice) were slightly exchanged. The sales of 新陳白元 (new and old white yuan) and 陰元 (yin yuan) to埠客 (port customers) were not active. The market was shaped by the addition of several fen to 1 jiao to the price of 白粳 (white japonica) in the morning, which turned tired in the evening. The price of 羊杜尖 (Yang Du tips) stood firm, and the price of 早薄稻 (early thin rice) was increased by nearly 1 jiao. The remaining goods were flat and tired.</p>

<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market situation: rumors in the market that there were 200,000 bags on the Jinpu Railway and 80,000 to 90,000 bags on the Longhai Railway that would arrive soon. It was also heard that the Xichang market had reported a drop of 3 jiao, which made the market in this city depressed and the transactions turned stagnant. The market only traded two cars of Dalian beans, with large grains priced at 4 yuan 3 jiao and medium grains at 4 yuan. 210 bags of Yingzhou frozen beans were priced at 3 yuan 5 jiao. 300 bags of Guide new beans were priced at 3 yuan 4 jiao 7. 100 bags of Tancheng beans were priced at 3 yuan 6 jiao 7.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Oil Market: Asphalt May Turn Charming <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>New asphalt is gradually being shipped out from Zhejiang Road. Over 100 pieces are being shipped out of the Jinhua-Lanxi area of eastern Zhejiang every day. According to reports in recent days, famous brands of Lanbai, such as Mingmache, Huabu, Fangjian, Hangbu, Dilongjian, and Youbu, are all priced at 15 yuan 4 jiao, Maoyi at 15 yuan, those with weaker identities at 14 yuan 8 jiao, Yujian at 15 yuan, Changpie at 15 yuan, and Quzhou Mingjian at 15 yuan 2 jiao. Those with 坯 (blocks) are priced at 14 yuan 6 jiao, Xijian at 14 yuan 4 jiao. Those requiring加一 (extra) must be priced according to the升 (increase). All are delivered to Jiangjiao. The price of inner ping oil is 18 yuan 4 jiao per 殂 (zuzu), outer ping oil is 17 yuan 6 jiao, and Xiaoxi oil is 11 yuan 2 jiao. 50 to 60 pieces of Kai Jiangjian were sold on the market for 14 yuan to Yangjiangjiao. It is said that a family is going to handle it. It is difficult to expect too cheap during the initial旺 (booming). Those with 後貨 (late goods) have the hope of re-旺 (booming). The market will of course have a chance to fall. Moreover, this year's Geng, the area has a large ripe year, and the amount of production will increase. However, Zhejiang West's年令 (harvest) is too small. Each 石 (dan) of 柏子 (cypress seeds) initially opened at 4 yuan 5 jiao and then immediately increased to about 5 yuan, and there is no place to receive the goods. The cost of this car oil must be more than 20 yuan, so car owners are unwilling to pre-sell. If we talk about previous years, when new goods are about to be produced, inland car owners must come to the Shanghai market to sell a batch, but this year's new goods have been released and are still silent. So, the Taotao in this port has not been handled by 本车 (this car) so far. This is truly due to 年令 (harvest). The new goods in Hanshi have not arrived, but Chen oil is gradually scarce, so the market is stable. The name of Zhong Jing Wumu is about 14 yuan per 砠 (chu), Youmu is 13 yuan 78 jiao, and Jinshi Wumu is 13 yuan 67 jiao. The higher priced sesame oil Chen goods are gradually decreasing and are sold for 13 yuan 78 jiao. It is heard that new goods will arrive soon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight contraction in Dutch exchange rates, but customs gold rose, leading to a better trend. Domestic raw sugar saw a sudden increase of about three jiao due to shortages in both arrivals and stocks. The guild's rowing boat type two coarse granulated white ordinary spot price was 18 yuan 5 jiao and a half, the official store's goods were 18 yuan 6 jiao and a half, transshipped goods were 5 yuan 2 jiao, and the number 8 and 9 Dutch red sugars were 13 yuan 9 jiao and a half, all with little change. Transshipped goods rose one jiao to 4 yuan 9 jiao and a half. The local factory's fine white sugar stopped issuing new receipts because raw materials were exhausted. The market outlook is bullish. Only 73 pieces of domestic new raw sugar arrived, so the price increase was even stronger, rising suddenly by about three jiao. Calculated, Gang raw sugar was 13 yuan 2 jiao, Longgang raw sugar was 12 yuan 7 jiao. Hong Kong merchants offered high-grade sliced raw sugar at over 160 * at 10 yuan 8 jiao, and bundled raw sugar at over 100 bundles at 10 yuan 9 jiao and a half, an increase of one or two jiao compared to before. Guangdong merchants offered 100 packages of old tax raw sugar at 12 yuan 4 jiao, showing a firm trend.</p>

<p>| Golden Needle Vegetable Prices Increase by Six or Seven Jiao |</p>
<p>Raw peanuts are in strong demand from Guangdong, and land prices have repeatedly risen, leading to a firm trend. According to yesterday's telegrams from Xuzhou and Kaifeng, prices rose by two or three jiao. Qingdao telegrams indicated that land prices rose again to the original price of 6 yuan 7 jiao, so the market sentiment is quite good. Yesterday, Guangdong merchants bought thousands of packages of raw peanuts from Tancheng, with higher grades at 6 yuan 8 jiao and lower grades ranging from 6 yuan to 5 yuan and a half, an increase of about two jiao compared to before. It is rumored that merchants from Shantou and Guangdong are interested in raw peanuts from Xuzhou, with prices above 6 yuan and a further increase in sight.

<h3 id="e269">Metals, Hardware Merchants Trade Cautiously at Year-End <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have recently shown a tightening trend. Due to the unusually tight credit situation in recent days, and hardware merchants anticipating that money shops and banks are preparing to wind down business as the end of the lunar year approaches, everyone is being cautious and prudent in extending credit. As a result, buying and selling have become even more sluggish. Therefore, in the whole city, apart from popular items, large-scale business transactions have decreased. As a result, the volume of transactions in the market has been decreasing day by day. Yesterday, over 200 boxes of tinplate were offered, with the price of good quality 90-pound goods at 15 yuan 8 jiao and a half, a drop of one jiao and a half. There were no price changes for other items. 200 large bars of lead were offered and purchased by printing houses, with transactions at 15 yuan 3 jiao. Fifty tons each of five- and six-point bamboo steel bars were sold, with the selling price for six-point sizes reduced by one yuan, selling for 123 yuan 5 jiao. There was no change in the five-point market. The sales of local Yuan nails to merchants from Sichuan and Hankou are still good, with 400 barrels sold, and the price remaining at 5 yuan 7 jiao and a half. There is a large demand for 18-sheet black iron sheets, but unfortunately, there are no goods on the market, causing buyers to be disappointed. Five- and seven-point English steel plates have also been sold, but the market supply is limited. In addition, angle iron, galvanized iron sheet, corrugated iron, new lead wire, autumn peel nails, shearing mouths, iron new foreign dollars, etc., have also been sold, but the quantities are not very large.</p>

<p>The rising trend of Japanese silk in Yokohama has not subsided. Both spot and futures silk prices in New York are trending upward. Merchants in Shanghai are starting to take advantage of the situation to cover short positions in yellow and white filature silk. Chinese silk merchants are maintaining a firm attitude, hoping to sell at higher prices. British and French merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and Beswick imported 80 packages of white filature silk and 40 packages of yellow filature silk, with prices trending upward.</p>

<p>In the local foreign merchants' tea market, Jardine Matheson, an English firm, has shown increasing interest in the core Precious Eyebrow and Emerald Green Tea from the Wuyuan and Tunxi areas. Jinlong, Tongfu, and Huacha tea firms have also made sporadic purchases, with a total of over 270 boxes traded in the city. High-end teas were offered at 119 yuan at the top end, and middle-grade teas were traded at 95 yuan, with little change compared to before. The sales of ordinary wholesale Precious Eyebrow and Gongxi Excellent Eyebrow teas remain sluggish. For Hubei and Hunan black teas, English merchant firms in the market sent out many telegrams yesterday, and the market is still brewing activity.</p>

<h3 id="e285">On Realistic Literature <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Can Yue</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Qi's article "Realistic and Romantic" published in this section. It elaborates the relationship between realism and creative imagination or fantasy in a quite detailed manner, which is very helpful for people to deeply contact and understand the vastness of the realistic literary structure. Although realism has been talked about a lot, it is generally believed that realism still remains on objectivism. This purely objectivist interpretation drags the free and broad realism into a shallow quagmire. Here, I would like to describe several characteristics of realistic texts, or perhaps it can make the relationship, similarities and differences between realism, romanticism and factualism clearer.</p>
<p>Romantic writers purely subjectively describe personal private life, or develop personal whims and fantasies; factualist writers purely objectively describe reality from a bystander's perspective; unrealistic fantasies of romanticism naturally depart from their own social practice, and the purely objective descriptions of factualism also separate social practice from themselves. Therefore, both romanticism and factualism have biases. However, realistic literature is not like this. It does not simply value either one or the other, but integrates and activates real life and personal ideals. Realistic observation cannot be effective with pure objectivity. Personal fantasy or romantic elements should also permeate from reality. Therefore, the "human" nature described by realism is a social type, a lively personality with objective conditions. The social phenomena described are dynamic parts, not static and dead things.</p>
<p>Realism does not reject idealistic elements; it needs lively ideals to illuminate the historical trend of reality. Therefore, the description of psychology is even more urgently needed. However, the psychological description of the characters' personalities should be described as a typical psychology in the development of the environment, rather than starting from the individual's psychological perspective to narrate the social development in the story (whether real or imaginary). In other words, the author should understand the generality and particularity of individual psychology from the unfolding of facts and the changes in the real environment, and analyze the individual psychology from the dynamic state of reality. If one does not base on the progress of reality and only relies on personal fantasy, that is the ethereal and empty fantasy of romanticism. This subjective view makes the content of the work stained with empty emphasis. As a result, many formulaic works that distort reality have made mistakes in this regard.</p>
<p>Realism should use a correct worldview to dissect realistic themes. The author unfolds the dynamic posture of reality from the story and carefully grasps the correct part. First; the author must see the development process of society, and the various fundamental forces that promote this process and determine this development. Not only should they explain it, but they should also consciously recognize that advancing trend. Therefore, realistic works are definitely no longer things that expose something. Second; the realistic view cannot be superficial, but should deeply understand the unity of internal opposites. One cannot regard the unity of opposites as the sum of examples. The process of social development contains phenomena that contradict and reject each other. Intercepting a period of the process in its own movement still contains a chaotic division, as well as further unity and opposition. This must be grasped from the dynamic aspect of society.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Mouse (Part 2) <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>Being bitten in one's shoes is considered unlucky by superstitious people, especially officials who are most taboo about it. After everyone washed their faces in the morning, there was still time before mealtime, so they would light a cigarette and chat as usual. But at mealtime, the "chimney" was nowhere to be seen, and everyone thought he had gone to buy shoes. So they talked about shoes, and the meal tasted particularly delicious than usual. When everyone returned to the room, they saw the "chimney" sitting alone, staring intently under his bed.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, are you so angry that you didn't even eat, Chimney?"</p>
<p>Another person lit a "post-meal cannon," glanced contemptuously at "Chimney," and chimed in: "Hmph, buying a pair of shoes," made a face, and lay down on the bed, yawning from oversleeping.</p>
<p>"Chimney's" nickname originally came from bragging, but at this time, he unexpectedly remained silent. The others were very excited, and all these officials recognized that a terrible daytime had already begun. The room was filled with smoke, some pacing, some sitting at their desks drawing circles, and adding two ink circles as eyes next to a person's name, and finally, someone laughed to themselves and finished. Everyone was silent for a while. Because of widespread indigestion, there was often a loud sucking sound amidst the smoke. Suddenly, a "squeak, squeak" sound called out from somewhere. "Chimney" dived into his bed like a tiger, and seemed to shout something like:</p>
<p>"Tickling the tiger's head, wearing a long gown will eventually attract customers! Run, run? You can't run away!"</p>
<p>At the same time, a cage woven from thorns and bamboo rolled out with him. A mouse squeaked and rushed around inside, not caring about hurting its head because it wanted to break free. "Chimney" held the mouse cage high above his head, jumping around outside, and seemed to shout something, but it was not clear in the commotion, probably something very heroic.</p>
<p>But a question came up: how to deal with this captured prisoner?</p>
<p>I remember that when I was a child, whenever I caught a mouse, I would rush to find a cat in every neighbor's house. Cats are insidious and cunning things, very fearful of getting into trouble. Even if you visit his grass hut thrice, he may not willingly be captured, so in order to find a cat, people often spent half a day racking their brains. It was probably because "the more labor, the greater the joy," and when they finally managed to invite a cat teacher, they were not only happy enough to shed tears, but they simply wanted to dance with joy. That was a very interesting game, called "cat's tail hanging." The mouse was tied to the cat's tail with a rope, so that the cat could not bite the mouse. Then the cat was released, and the show began: the cat hooked its head back and wanted to eat the mouse, the mouse was so scared that it cried "goo goo," the cat was even more afraid that the mouse would bite its tail, and wanted to eat it quickly, so it spun around, and the "meow meow goo goo" sounds mixed together, until everyone was tired of it. Although this cruel prank was not very "humane," the children did not care much.</p>
<p>Officials were no longer children. When the time came to exercise their power, they would always come up with new tricks. After a small dispute, everyone finally agreed: to light a sky lantern. In fact, this trick was not new, but it was just an old punishment previously applied to people, and now it was used on mice.</p>
<p>At a certain period, humans were cruel and loved killing. When there was no one to sacrifice, they turned to animals. This was a very spectacular execution. Everyone waited, and dusk finally arrived. Everyone gathered in the open space behind the yamen, waiting to cheer for the last time. Although it was just a mouse, the situation was almost the same as watching a murder.</p>
<p>A mouse covered in kerosene, lit with fire, was not without its grandeur. It could be seen rolling and running in the open space like a ball of fire, making a shrill squeaking sound. It ran and rolled, and just as it was moving forward vigorously, it suddenly turned back, seemingly wanting to find a comfortable cave to hide in. Even a negligible life still knew how to escape, even though it clearly knew that it was on fire and everything was hopeless. After ten minutes or perhaps only a few minutes, amidst the cheers of people stamping their feet, it could not help but stop struggling and fall down. It reached a burial place where even finding water wouldn't give a peaceful burial.</p>
<p>After this, the mouse's momentum was greatly reduced. Although it still galloped on the ceiling, because the number of family members was sharply reduced, it was not as rampant as before. There were even fewer who dared to come out for a leisurely stroll. The "lighting sky lanterns" execution could still be seen every night, but it no longer had the initial excitement, and some people preferred to sit by the window and watch the lanterns.</p>
<p>Naturally, the rats were still not completely eradicated. The person called "Chimney" was dismissed for dereliction of duty, and on the eve of his departure, he seemed to say resentfully:</p>
<p>"Rats, rats! There are many heroes in the world who fall (note) into the mouths of rats!"</p>
<p>Such a hero could not forget his bitten shoes. Soon the mousetrap also disappeared, and the rats became rampant again, and gradually dared to walk on the tables and under the tables.</p>
<p>(Note) "Fall" means to fall down. An abbreviation of "fall."</p>
<h3 id="e287">[Zikai's Cartoons, My Collection] Preface <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Sun</p>
<p>Because I enjoyed reading the articles in the "Free Talk" section of the Shenbao newspaper, I kept each issue as it came out. Recently, I sorted them and bound them into three large volumes, and even drew what I thought were very beautiful designs for their covers. Furthermore, I used a knife to carefully cut out each of Mr. Zikai's cartoons that were published inside. Then, I bought some gray cardstock, folded it into pages the size of a sixteenmo book, and pasted two cartoons onto each page. In this way, I created a separate album. I also drew a cover for it and titled it "Zikai's Cartoons, My Collection."</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I seem to be a person with a ["collecting癖"] (?), but what I collect is limited to the books and newspapers that I enjoy. Therefore, I preserve every newspaper supplement that I like, keeping it completely intact and binding it in a way that I find very aesthetically pleasing. I remember that this habit began way back in my first year of middle school, inspired by the "Awakening" section of the Shanghai Min Guo Daily; since then, this practice has never stopped. However, those early works were lost at a friend's place in Shanghai and were destroyed in the ["January 28th Incident"] fire, which I still deeply regret!</p>
<p>Regarding this troublesome collecting work, many friends have asked me in the past: What is the meaning of all this? I couldn't answer, so I could only vaguely say, "I like it."</p>
<p>In reality, I am not a scholar, not a specialized researcher. I do this work with no particular ambition or agenda. Besides occasionally flipping through it myself, it's simply because I like it, I'm interested, I enjoy doing it; I just want to do it.</p>
<p>But since Mr. Zikai's cartoons are published in the "Free Talk" section, why did I have to cut them out one by one and bind them into a separate album? There are several other reasons.</p>
<p>First, because of my special love for Zikai's cartoons.</p>
<p>Second, in my collection of "Free Talk" issues, there are a total of over sixty of Zikai's cartoons, from early exploratory works to the "Wonton Noodle Vendor," which I thought was enough to bind into an album.</p>
<p>Third, it's more enjoyable to look at this way.</p>
<p>If you were to ask me why I have such a special fondness for Zikai's cartoons, it's not only because Mr. Zikai's painting skills are so profound; what I love most is the subject matter of the paintings and the content within.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a deep impression that has not faded to this day, which is my initial understanding of Zikai's cartoons. This impression came from a cartoon Mr. Zikai made for ["Middle School Student"] magazine more than four years ago. At that time, I was still a middle school student; even now, without closing my eyes, I only need to think for a moment, and the cartoon appears clearly before me: a young man wearing glasses and Western-style clothing, carrying books and stationery, striding briskly past a sorrowful young man, burdened with a heavy wonton noodle carrying pole; besides the signature "TK," there was a title that read "Classmates from Elementary School Days."</p>
<p>That cartoon plunged me into a very long, deep contemplation, almost indistinguishably merging with the image: it made me think of the elementary school classmates I encountered when I returned home for the holidays; some had become peddlers, some had become laborers, some... In this way, it gently sowed seeds of sadness in my heart; however, I felt that this sadness was a beneficial ["comfort"] to my spirit.</p>
<p>["Because Feng Zikai's paintings are indeed simple and easy to understand on the surface, lacking any mystery or novelty, the meaning within the paintings is not superficial. Where does it not reveal life? Take a moment to savor it, and you will discover your own sorrows and vexations, and feel that the painting can be a spokesperson for your sorrows."]</p>
<p>丨Excerpt from Zhou Qi's ["On Feng Zikai"].</p>
<p>The characters and events that appear in Zikai's cartoons are all familiar; the lines in the paintings are always so simple, everyone can understand them, and everyone who sees them feels a burst of inexplicable relaxation in their heart, and it easily leaves you with a clear and bright impression.丨This is Mr. Zikai's greatest success.</p>
<p>In addition to making cartoons, Mr. Zikai is also a master of writing short essays; reading his short essays is as pleasant and flavorful as reading his cartoons. Therefore, his ability to write short essays also helps his cartoons,丨often making the titles of the paintings so good; sometimes it precisely compensates for the inadequacy of his simple compositions.</p>
<p>Take the sixty-odd cartoons that I have collected, for example, almost every one of them relies on his appropriate titles to further enhance the perfection of the painting's meaning.</p>
<p>Like "A Boy and A Dog," "99th Beat," "Their Sofa," "Sanitary Equipment," "Variety and Unity," etc., all have profound humor.</p>
<p>"Eastern Neighbors Offer Condolences, Western Neighbors Offer Congratulations," "The May Thirtieth Song," "The Ratio of Three to One," etc., all express profound satire.</p>
<p>"You Peel a Melon for Me, I Fan You," "Take It Down," "We Are Going to Welcome the Lantern Festival," etc., further express the innocent childlike heart of children. "Green and White," "Willow Shade," etc., are simply a beautiful essay, a poem with harmonious rhythms.</p>
<p>And "Destination," "Selling Broth," "Barber's Pole," "Cooling Off," "Sugar Cake," "Rickshaw," "Do You Want to See," etc., are all quick sketches taken from our environment and things around us. When we look at these quick sketches, we cannot help but be aroused to great interest and attention in the circumstances of life.</p>
<p>There are also those scenes of rural life, as well as those old-fashioned life situations that still exist in the countryside, which have almost been forgotten by us who have lived in the city for a long time, or even never known about. Mr. Zikai, however, uses his artistic brush to leave them a permanent memorial. Such as: "The Two-Stringed Instrument," "Fifth Sister-in-Law," "The Herdboy and the Weaver Girl Stars," "Southern Fields," "Talking About Hemp," etc.</p>
<p>In addition, there are realistic portrayals of tragic events, such as: "Distributing Gruel," "Offering Tea," "Clouds and Rainbows," "Eighty-Seven Years Old," etc., all of which are deeply touching works.</p>
<p>After pasting Mr. Zikai's cartoons, I also cut out a photo of Mr. Zikai from the "Second Anniversary Issue of The Analects" and pasted it at the beginning of the album; I pasted Zhou Qi's "On Feng Zikai," from the "Free Talk" section, at the end.</p>
<p>In this way, this collection of mine is considered complete.</p>
<p>Although it won't be published, this album will surely be borrowed and looked at by friends; they will inevitably ask me again, What is the meaning of doing this kind of work? To avoid the trouble of repeatedly answering in words, I feel it necessary to write a preface.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have written the above words as a self-preface.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Hot Towel <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>

<p>— (Written by Joseph Conrad)</p>
<p>["What! That boy? Unwilling to look at the only sensible girl within a few miles?"] ["What do you think I'm waiting for here, my dear丨my dear丨my dear?………What? You wait. You just wait. You will know tomorrow. I will soon丨"]</p>
<p>["Bethan! Bethan! Bethan!"] Old Gerveil roared inside. ["Bethan! 丨My pipe!"] That fat blind man was extremely lazy. He wouldn't even lift his hand to take the things she had carefully placed next to his elbow. In that parlor (in which he was familiar with everything, just as if he had not lost his sight) he would not even move his limbs if he did not call her to his side and put all the cruel responsibility on her shoulders. He would not even get up from his chair, not even cross one foot over the other. Without her constant service, he would not eat a single thing. He needed help beyond his disability, or was he deliberately torturing her for it? She stood for a moment, gritting her teeth in the dark, then turned and slowly walked through the door.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd walked back to his shovel. The shouting in Gerveil's cottage had stopped, and soon after, the downstairs parlor window lit up. A man came down the street with a steady, leisurely pace, but he seemed to see Captain Hagberd, because he took a step or two back. At this time, in the sky on both sides, there was still a cold white light. The man leaned against the gate in a very interesting manner.</p>
<p>["You must be Captain Hagberd."] He said calmly and confidently.</p>
<p>The old man turned around, picked up his shovel, somewhat startled by the strange voice.</p>
<p>["Yes, I am."] He replied somewhat annoyed.</p>
<p>The other man smiled at him and said very slowly, ["I believe you advertised for your son?"]</p>
<p>["My son Harry"] Captain Hagberd mumbled inadvertently for the first time. ["He's coming home tomorrow."]</p>
<p>["He is the devil!"] The stranger found it very strange, so he continued in a slightly altered tone: ["You've grown a beard like Santa Claus."]</p>

<h3 id="e290">Studying Dead Books and Reading Dead Books (Part 2) <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>What does it mean to read dead books? Reading dead books and studying dead books are not the same. Perhaps the materials being read are not good, or perhaps the method of reading is not correct, then even a living book becomes a dead book. Therefore, reading dead books can be explained in several ways.</p>
<p>1.  It means swallowing information whole without digesting it, being unable to apply it.</p>
<p>2.  It means reading completely useless books, or even harmful books.</p>
<p>3.  It means flipping through books randomly, looking at whatever, without any system.</p>
<p>The first type was common among scholars in our country in the past; that is why there were xiucai (successful candidates in the imperial examination) who could not even write a simple note. The second type also has many drawbacks, such as the recent phenomenon of students being fond of reading martial arts novels, or supernatural novels, or romance novels, leading to bizarre events such as four apprentices from a rice shop in Wuxi suddenly disappearing, claiming to have gone out to seek enlightenment. As for the third type of problem, it is even more common; I myself suffer greatly from this problem, so my reading makes no progress and brings no benefit.</p>
<p>Reading must have a purpose, be orderly, and be systematic. Because books are as numerous as sweat could dampen, not only the ancient books of our country are too many to read, but now, with the addition of foreign books, there is even less energy and time to examine them one by one. One can only take the books that one wants to study and likes to study, and study them. In the past, our country's scholars included ["experts in Confucian classics,"] historians, ["experts in Neo-Confucianism,"] essayists, ["textual critics,"] ["commentators,"] and ["etymologists,"] etc., most of whom focused on one type of learning and studied it diligently. They were right about their method of studying learning, but unfortunately, the objects of their study cannot be said to be completely useless, but many did waste their energy and work hard for no gain. This method of study is the same method used by foreign scholars to study ["philosophy,"] ["science,"] ["psychology,"] ["law,"] ["sociology,"] etc., but the objects of study are divided into ["dead"] and ["alive"].</p>
<p>This statement is entirely for those who read for the sake of reading, for those who read to study learning. But how many people in our country have this energy and this leisure? In addition, there are those who read to become officials, those who read to do business, those who read to find a job in society, and those who read to simply be on a school roster, and these are in the majority. They can only take commonly used books and study them, which is another kind of reading method.</p>
<p>Reading in the private school style is naturally different from reading in the school style. Reading in the private school style is too bitter, while reading in the school style is too sweet. The private school style spends too little time on reading, which is certainly not suitable. But the school style wastes too much time on reading, which is also a pity. Currently, going to school costs so much that it is not easy for families to bear, not to mention the long ["winter vacation,"] ["spring vacation,"] and ["summer vacation"]. In a week, there is a ["Sunday"] holiday, as well as ["various commemorative"] days and ["sports meets,"] etc. The time spent reading in a year is only half of what it could be, which is such a pity!</p>
<p>Some say that private schools teach dead books, while schools teach living books, but I am afraid that is not entirely true. In schools, there are dozens of students in the same grade, with varying levels of intelligence, different hobbies, some liking English, some liking mathematics, some liking Chinese, and some disliking all learning. Therefore, the insights gained from the same book vary greatly among students. Thus, reading in the ["private school style"] is like ["holding the cow's head down to eat grass"], while reading in the ["school style"] is like ["ducks eating snails"], and the drawbacks are not that different? Therefore, those who are good at reading can not only benefit from reading good books, but also benefit from reading bad books. Therefore, Confucius said, ["When walking with two others, I can always find a teacher. I choose their good qualities and follow them, and their bad qualities and correct them"].</p>
<p>In short, it is fine not to read, but if you want to read, the first thing is to ["want"] to. If you ["want"] to, you will be willing to study, and if you are willing to study, you will feel interested, and if you are interested, you will make progress. Therefore, as the saying goes, ["Nothing is difficult in the world for those who put their heart into it"]. If you have a heart for it, then nothing cannot be accomplished. If you don't want to, you will not be willing to study, and if you don't study, where will interest come from? As for whether a person who reads can apply what they learn, that depends on the person. ["There was a person in the Song Dynasty who was good at making a medicine to prevent chapped hands, and his family made a living by washing cotton wadding for generations. A traveler heard of it and bought the recipe for a thousand gold, and used it to persuade the King of Wu, who rewarded him with land and a title"]. This is the difference between being able to apply and not being able to apply.</p>

<h3 id="e291">On Children's Literature <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Renmu</p>
<p>In recent years, bookstores have been publishing many children's books.</p>
<p>If it is true that these books are published to address the knowledge needs of children, then this phenomenon is commendable. However, to be honest, almost all bookstores publish children's books for profit.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with making a profit. Although bookstores are said to be for spreading culture, they naturally must also consider their own business, so making a profit is not a contradictory thing. However, it is very bad to disregard the content of the books because of profit. When we look at the children's books they publish, when we see the intellectual food that these authors bestow upon children, we feel that there are indeed quite a few that we cannot agree with or learn from.</p>
<p>Among these books, those that are of the preaching type are naturally too numerous to mention. In addition, there are many works that go far beyond reality and are completely irrelevant to children's real lives. And the old tune of pigs, dogs, and cows is still being brought out and replayed. If these children's works are simply copied and printed, it seems better not to create or print them.</p>
<p>Children's knowledge should be developed, this is certainly a fact, but before developing their knowledge, one must always consider their proper direction. Like the types of works mentioned above, some want to teach children to become old-fashioned scholars, some are not suitable for children's own environment, and some put them into the group of pigs, dogs, cows, and sheep. I ask, what benefit is there to children? Is this really the right path to develop children's knowledge?</p>
<p>The reason why Ilin's fairy tales are so popular with children in our country and around the world is very simple: it is because he writes about ["children's real lives"]. I think children's literature should pay attention to this point.</p>
<h3 id="e292">The Forgotten Person <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Spending every day in a living circle filled with five-colored lights, metal instruments, the smell of smoke, alcohol, and face powder, the sensory functions gradually become dull. Because the people and things seen every day are truly tiresome and annoying. But one day my senses suddenly returned to their original sensitivity. It was from this day that I discovered a new flower that had been added to the ranks of flowers. 丨丨A young girl, her seat was close to the music stage, in a not very advantageous corner. When she entered this unfamiliar and ever-changing environment on her first night, I paid attention to her. A male leader led her and pointed out her seat, but she did not sit down immediately and hesitated, as if questioning whether she would be spending such days sitting here from today onwards. She stood for a while, and finally sat down.</p>
<p>People, especially all the companions, fixed her with sharp and strange gazes. This made the newcomer, who was completely unaccustomed to that scene, even more uneasy. Her head was lowered slightly, and her eyes stared at the floor, not moving for a long time, sitting there so lonely.</p>
<p>Sitting silently for half a day, a young man came up and she jumped away. While dancing, her eyes still dared not freely glance at the people around her. And her expression was very unnatural. And when the lights came on and the music stopped, a commotion of voices and footsteps arose in the silence. She came back and was confused for a moment, unable to recognize her own seat, but sat down in someone else's seat next to her.</p>
<p>A kind of completely unforgiving sneer immediately burst out of everyone's nostrils. Then a blush flew up her face, all the way to the roots of her ears.</p>
<p>It was common to see her head raised when the lights were off, and when the lights came on, she would quickly look at the floor again. As if afraid of seeing people, and also afraid of being seen by people.</p>
<p>She continued to live so lonely. Every day she dressed as brightly as a night-blooming lily, planted like a flower in countless flower bushes, slipping from the arms of that stranger into the arms of another stranger, using her youthful body and youthful smile to exchange for a little reward. However, it was not necessarily easy to be appreciated. Like her, the number of nights she sat empty was always greater than the number of times someone came to dance with her. Even on the busiest nights at the end of the week, the other companions encountered more soulmates, not a single song was missed, and it was the most enjoyable day of the week.</p>
<p>Everyone was full of energy, smiling happily. But, only she was still sitting coldly, even sitting empty the whole night, no one came to her, no one asked about her. So lonely, she spent her time in vain, watching her companions smile so triumphantly. Then her own face became even more沉 down,沉 down into endless melancholy.</p>
<p>A lonely heart and a forgotten girl!</p>
<p>She was as young as her companions, and painted with the colors of youth and beauty just like them. It was only because the colors of her beauty were covered by a layer of life's shadows丨that they were dulled for no reason.</p>
<p>Often arriving before the others, and similarly often leaving before the others, it was really too lonely. Always sitting there alone. Watching other companions smile and greet the men who came forward, and in the shadow of the lights, hang their chins on the shoulders of the other party, chattering non-stop. Thinking about wanting to please people, even if you try to put on a smiling face, it looks like you're crying, and still no one appreciates that crying smile of hers.</p>
<p>The days fly by quickly, and the days that can be spent in the flower bushes are also very short. And because of excessive worry and the erosion of loneliness, the shadow of depression on her brow became thicker.</p>
<p>There was even less hope for fantasy.</p>
<p>Such a lonely flower, blooming lonely in countless flower bushes, and withering lonely. When it blooms, no one praises it, and when it withers, no one sighs or pities it.</p>
<p>A forgotten person and a lonely heart.</p>
<p>Her coming only made me pay attention, making my senses suddenly keen. Other than that, it seemed that no one else saw her. Now that she has quietly left this place, my keen senses that were caused by her have returned to dullness, and also added a layer of dark clouds that were infected from her loneliness, for her loneliness.</p>

<p>▲News "Movie Fan Weekly" is currently the most valuable and interesting movie publication in the publishing world. Both the text and the illustrations are extremely impressive. The eleventh issue published yesterday is a reform issue. In addition to the original special news and film theory, there are also new works such as special features on movie stars. In particular, Mr. Huang Peixia's long novel "Chronicles of the Film Kingdom," which depicts the realities of the Chinese film industry, is vividly written and is a rare work. Readers do not need to search for hidden meanings from the surnames of the characters. One read will tell you who someone is. Priced at five cents, all newspapers are expected to sell it on consignment.</p>

<p>Talking about the West Chamber Moon is profound before. Hongniang accompanies the beautiful golden lady. Wanting to be reborn into endless suffering. Two golden hairpins, the clouds ... sigh. Ear-hanging pearl rings flutter. White silk shirt, the wind carries a strange fragrance, jade compared above. Gold bracelet, hexagram garment beads, eyes. Extreme silk, flowers full of embroidery. Pink skirt flashing willow ... Qing. Bow shoes folding around the flower street. Seeing the peony flower pavilion, peony pavilion. Walking to the front of Yeyun Pavilion, looking up, seeing nine lotus lanterns hanging high in front of the pavilion. Hoping to meet Zhang Jun in my heart. Meeting a confidant under the Hall of Eternal Life. He himself has put in a lot of effort and heart. Like Kongming in the Three Kingdoms. The bright moon shines in the green garden. Brocade steps run to the ground, leading to the spirit. Wishing to complete the bridal candle soon. Shishi, shouting can make a name. Wishing for official virtues and three autumn osmanthus. A hundred years of marriage, tied with vermilion threads. Eternal reunion, old age is not old because.</p>

I don't know if the concubine can sing. Waiting for me to listen to the palace business on the clapper. The noble concubine has a gentle and charming voice, and the clapper sounds. With a clever mind and eloquent mouth, there is no match in the world. Jade hand gently pours the dripping wine. Nectar stored in the golden pot. Yang Guifei is drunk, her red complexion is exposed. The palace maids help her onto the ivory bed. Like a painting of a spring sleeping begonia. The Emperor is looking for joy. Suddenly heard the prostitute's fright. Gao Lishi announced the entry of Prime Minister Yang. Guozhong trembles and reports to the Emperor. Tongguan has been breached by the Hu slaves. The rebel soldiers have already entered the Guanxiang.

<p>Jiang Qiuwu escaped from the tiger's mouth. After disguising himself and returning to the south, he often wanted to repay the life-saving grace of the sunset glow. Because he did not know the address of the sunset glow, he wrote a letter to Wan You, asking him to inquire on his behalf. Wan You could not refuse because of his friendship, so he took the letter to Tianxiang Hutong and asked Grandma Feng to forward it. However, the Zhao family had moved to Xicheng, so Grandma Feng could no longer meet with the sunset glow every day. One day, Grandma Feng went to Xicheng specifically and happened to meet the sunset glow on the way. At that time, she handed Jiang Qiuwu's letter to her, completing the duties of a matchmaker.</p>

<h3 id="e301">The Almost Happened Blindness of Jean Harlow (Part 1) <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>What if Jean Harlow, the star of [Wife vs. Secretary] recently shown in this city, went blind? That would certainly be an incredible thing, but not long ago, it was not something absolutely impossible. No one outside has heard about this. Even Jean Harlow herself kept it a secret. It wasn't until recently, when her doctor told her that all danger had passed, that she talked about it with a journalist, and some people outside began to know about it. For the past four years, Jean Harlow has been living in constant fear, afraid that her charming eyes would really go blind. In the past four years, she has also absolutely avoided people talking about this. Only a few close people in her family knew what pain she had suffered in body and spirit in these years!</p>
<p>Now this secret can be made public because her doctor has guaranteed that she will not suffer the pain of blindness. But how did this matter come up again? It was brought about by an accident. Everyone knows that Jean Harlow has some problems with one of her feet. Several years ago, while filming [Hell's Angels], she fell and broke three small bones in her foot. These three small bones have never been properly set, so she often loses her balance and falls. Last month, she fell again, falling from the low wall of her garden. It took almost several weeks for her to walk normally. At that time, a familiar journalist went to visit her, and in the course of the conversation, they talked about her eyes. When the journalist comforted her, Jean said: [What does this count for? The suffering my eyes have endured is much worse.] Jean said, knowing that she had revealed the secret, so she simply told the truth: [I haven't told anyone about this. But now that most of it is in the past, we might as well talk about it. Speaking of which, that incident also happened during the filming of [Hell's Angels]. Do you remember the last section of [Hell's Angels], wasn't it in color? At that time, the method of filming color films was still very primitive. At that time, they were still in the experimental stage. They knew very little. They only knew that when filming color films, the lighting must be three or four times stronger than when filming ordinary films. So all around were filled with arc lights, and there was no place for the actors to walk. I filmed many close-ups. When filming close-ups, many large lights surrounded the sides of the camera. When I was filming, I had to look at the camera with my eyes, and many lights were directly radiating into my eyes. The heat was very high, but I didn't feel it was that high at the time. I filmed close-ups for two consecutive days. Every night when I went home, I felt a splitting headache, unbearable for a moment. I thought at the time that the headache was just caused by overwork of the eyes. But after a few days, my headache became more and more severe. Soon my eyes gradually became inconvenient. I originally had very strong eyesight, but later... I felt blurred and couldn't see clearly.</p>
<p>[Finally, I went to see a doctor. He examined me in detail. His diagnosis was almost unbelievable. He said my eyes were burned. The transparent membrane covering the outside of the eyeballs was scorched by the intense light, just like a person's skin being sunburned by the intense sunlight. Of course, my skin was protected by a thick layer of wax, but my eyes had no protection at all. Of course, this is a strange thing that everyone has never heard of. Even that doctor said it was a very rare thing, but his diagnosis was absolutely true. So he had to start with surgery. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e302">Review of [Storm] <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>The Storm 丨 Paris Screening</p>
<p>The original play [Thunderstorm] (The Thunderstorm) is one of the famous works among the more than fifty plays by the famous Russian writer Ostrovsky (1823-1886), and it is also a familiar play in the Russian stage repertoire. In the Soviet Union in 1933 after the storm, it was not accidental that this film was made under the significance of critically accepting artistic heritage, reviewing the past life, and showing and building the future.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned here in passing that the Soviet Union's filming of [Circus], [Thunderstorm], and even Maupassant and Balzac's novels should not be superficially understood as the main turning point of Soviet cinema, because this is the same as Hollywood's production tending towards [Nana], [Camille], and [The Count of Monte Cristo], etc. The significance and attitude are different, aren't they? The latter's tendency mainly expresses [the exhaustion of themes] and [the business eye], which is generally recognized. The former is due to the development of film culture 丨 the same as other cultural departments 丨 to a certain stage, reviewing, looking forward, and horizontal photography.</p>
<p>Naturally, after watching [Thunderstorm], you will feel it. It is indeed different from [Road to Life], [The Gold Rush], and [Marionettes]. But this difference does not diminish the significance of the production of [Thunderstorm].</p>
<p>The original author, A., is known as [the master of portraying social figures of that time]. The editors of the film, Fanshibo Chaifu and director Petrov, more faithfully and objectively performed and completed the characters in the play, that is, they typically exposed the people in the social domination of that era.</p>
<p>The old widow's meanness, stubbornness, cruelty, and pretending to be religious 丨 considering it the sin of the daughter-in-law for not bringing 30,000 yuan of dowry, scolding the daughter-in-law and son for embracing when they separated and confided in their grievances as [shameless], ordering the daughter-in-law to swear [never to go near the window to look around, never to peek at any young man;] torturing her by wanting to [bury her alive] etc.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy and flippancy of the merchant class 丨 saying that [all merchants are honest and fair,] the female customer said: [The ruler is better,] but he grabbed her hand and said: [Sweet as chocolate,] and took pride in being ridiculed by his colleagues for [being too gentle with female customers;] casually slapping the young apprentices, and throwing the apprentices on the ground like wood, etc. The selfishness, cruelty, and greed of the merchant's noble son who had attended a higher business school, whose sister attended university, and who inherited one million yuan 丨 when he first came to find Katerina, she refused him with [I am a married woman]. When she finally fled out of the dark family and the custom that [an adulteress must be killed] to ask to go with him to Siberia, he only said [For the sake of my future, I have to work hard] [May God bless you], and abandoned her who had [lived with him for ten nights] and went on horseback to Siberia, etc. And the oppression of Katerina, and the inability to find a way out 丨丨 even the woman who was unwilling to tell a lie to deceive the [great, dear mother-in-law], the girl gave her the key to open the back door to meet her lover, she did not accept it, refused the lover with [a married woman], finally accepted the love of others, and even repented in public, etc., these are the profound and typical descriptions of Russia at the time of [before the storm], what kind of feelings will the people of [after the storm] have when they see it!</p>
<p>Director Petrov in this film, in summary, is messy and somewhat repetitive. But the delicate and everywhere emphasis on the description of the atmosphere of the play is his success. Unlike many Hollywood directors who only pay attention to the acting of the protagonist and neglect the air of the play. In the wedding banquet, the mother-in-law was unhappy because of haggling over the dowry, and the bride only cared about drinking when she told the groom about her past for the first time, and fell asleep on the bed without taking off her boots. These two scenes hinted at the center of the whole play and the character of the characters in the play. That kind of exaggeration of the form of marriage, regardless of whether the content is satisfactory or not, is also deeply meaningful. The capture of dawn, moonlit night, and Volga, etc. formed extremely beautiful pictures. As for the sound effects, it was a great success.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, due to the matching of personality and the proper handling of the director, everyone successfully achieved the degree that should be expressed. Among them, Qieluofu, who played Guderli, was seen by us in [Road to Life]. Although his role here is not as much as that of the villain Fomu Ka in [Road to Life], the deep impression given to people is not reduced to that of other actors.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Review of [Air Hostess] <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Air Hostess 丨 Cathay</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the themes adopted by American films are indeed very narrow. Horse racing, ball games, boxing matches, boat races, airplanes, and other stimulating themes have been used many times by American film writers. The impression given to people by this phenomenon is that American film themes are lacking. But on the contrary, we also see that they dare not adopt broader themes from the vast crowd, such as in factories and rural areas, there are inexhaustible materials waiting for writers to adopt. So it cannot be said that there is a lack of themes, but that they consciously narrow the scope of themes. As for the application of stimulating materials, there is also the meaning of emphasizing the business eye, which is needless to say.</p>
<p>Now we have seen [Air Hostess] with aviation as the theme again. Regarding this film, we can't find anything except watching a romance between men and women woven into the theme of aviation. Naturally, we can often see this kind of stereotyped story in American movies, and being brave for love here is the most obvious theme of the playwright.</p>
<p>In order to form the love dispute, the appearance of a wealthy and lustful widow is very necessary. Here, as in the methods used in general movies, the widow pours wine on the aviator, goes to the room to change into pajamas, and then the widow sensually seduces him. When the aviator's wife comes to find him, she intentionally wants him to light a cigarette for herself to show her intimacy: these are things that the audience is tired of eating like everyday meals.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that the director's technique is still good, for example, when the two assistants of the female aviator are fighting, they fight very nervously, very like the real thing. In addition, when the female aviator knows that her husband is going to the widow's house, the connecting scenes are also very good. Naturally, this is to say that the director has successfully portrayed the character of a wife who is loyal to love. As for the climax in the back, it is not good.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Golden City Tetralogy <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Songhua</p>
<p>The momentum of domestic films seems to have declined a bit recently. In this recent silent air, I suddenly heard that Golden City will continuously release four major domestic blockbusters. Isn't this good news worth reporting? Now, let me briefly introduce the general situation of these four films below.</p>
<p>The Goddess The Goddess film is the latest production of Lianhua Film Company. The main actors are Ruan Lingyu, Li Keng, Zhang Zhizhi, etc. The director is Wu Yonggang. Wu has a very long history in the film industry. Anyone who pays a little attention to the film industry can talk about it. Although it is his first time as a director, the quality of the harvest has exceeded our expectations. This film depicts the general women who groan in hell, who are forced by the environment to engage in this flesh and blood career, but their souls are always pure. The film has a very clear expression of the dual life of such women, the conflict between their conscience and external forces, which is profound and painful, unprecedented. As for the expressions of Ruan Lingyu and Li Keng, etc., of course, they will not disappoint people. This film is scheduled to be released on the 7th (Friday).</p>
<p>The Ordeal of Peach and Plum This is a debut work of the Diantong Company. The achievement of three-friend-style recording has already had a considerable position in the domestic film industry. However, making films themselves is still the first time. And its achievement is unexpectedly excellent, which cannot but be said to be a good phenomenon in domestic films. The content of the film strives to be realistic, depicting a group of young people who are affected by the social depression and the treachery of people's hearts, feel the pain of unemployment, and have a clear indication of the spirit of cooperation between husband and wife. Everything about it is moving in a new direction, which is not comparable to ordinary outdated films. The director is Ying Yunwei, and the main actors are Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er, etc. They all have considerable reputations on the drama stage. Therefore, the performance of [The Ordeal of Peach and Plum] can be said to be amazing.</p>
<p>Flying Flower Village Speaking from the heart, the [Flying Flower Village] film is an excellent production of Yihua Company. Not only is its story tortuous and sad, but also its skills have quite amazing achievements. Zheng Yingshi, this director, his sensitive wrist gave us a very good impression in the [Spring Tide] film. He, directing this [Flying Flower Village] is even more unwilling to relax, so the result is very satisfactory. Furthermore, speaking of Gao Zhanfei's performance, someone has long said that he is progressing rapidly and his future is unlimited. Please wait and see Gao Zhanfei in [Flying Flower Village], and you will definitely be more satisfied. There is also Hu Ping's expression, which has unexpected gains. Wang Naidong's villain is of course worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The Highway This is a major work of Lianhua Company this year. Although the film has not yet been released, the two famous songs in [The Highway], [The Highway Song] and [Pioneer of the Highway], have long been spread in the air of Shanghai. The poet director Sun Yu is the ancestor of changing film styles, and of course he has many new contributions in [The Highway]. All the male stars of Lianhua, Jin Yan, Zheng Junli, Zhang Yi, Zhang Zhizhi, Luo Peng, Han Langen, Shang Guanwu, etc., are all out together, and each is an important role; in addition, there are two female stars, Li Lili and Chen Yanyan, who also joined in the cooperation. We only need to take a look at these many names to guess that it is not an ordinary work. As for the慷慨激昻 of the plot, it is even more rare to see in domestic films.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Wu Lizhu Cries for Li Faxi at Night <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>Under the leadership of director Ren Pengnian, the large team of the Yueming Company was shooting the exteriors of [Delirium] in Suzhou. They brought generators, so even in Jinshanbang, which is far from the city, the lights must be shining at night. Because the actors had no other recreation, they casually came up with some pastimes, which attracted villagers to watch every night, and cheers were thunderous. The heroine Wu Lizhu, who is from Shanghai, often pulled up the Ningbo tune at 10:00 PM when the lights were turned off and cried for the screenwriter Li Faxi. The actresses such as Wu Ling and Chen Peizhu also joined in, so there was a piece of miserable sound, really like someone died, and this was the finale every night before going to bed.</p>

<p>— Zhong Jia</p>
<p>When Pan Xi saw Johnny, she couldn't help but be secretly startled. How could he resemble his father so much? His voice, manner, and smile were just like his father reborn. She thought she would never see that smile or hear that voice again. Seeing him, of course, she couldn't say she didn't know his father. Even if she wanted to pretend, she couldn't. Nor could she say she had forgotten. Forgotten John? Just thinking of his name made her heart ache... Even now... Thinking of their time together... The scenes of them walking together... All those moments spent sitting together in the twilight... She resolutely and proudly refused the weekly allowance that his son offered her... That sum of money that could have freed her from worrying about food and clothing for the rest of her life... All the things she had done in her life were already countless, but she would rather be a beggar than accept a subsidy from John's son. Accepting his subsidy would be like selling the only perfect thing in her life. It would be like taking a price for the sacred love she had generously given to John. So, in the end, she refused Johnny's support, even though Johnny was often worried about her well-being. Now, she had committed a new crime, and Judge Darley was going to call out her old friend's son again, adding to his worries, which made her feel extremely uncomfortable. After a while, Johnny came, and Darley discussed the matter with him in another room. Then, he rushed into the room where Pan Xi was sitting. Pan Xi immediately looked up as she saw them walk in. Darley spoke first: "Pan Xi, Mr. Mills and I have discussed your case. He advised me not to be too hard on you. So, I won't send you to the island. We are going to send you to a nursing home." Johnny's heart couldn't bear to see the sad and bitter look on the old woman's face. Pan Xi suddenly stood up, glaring at them, and said: "I'd rather go to jail!" Her hands were clasped together, expressing the infinite pain in her heart. "That place is where I used to go to do good deeds. It's full of crippled old women sitting in rocking chairs, basking in the sun, knitting wool for a living. Do you think I'll end up like that? I won't! I'm going to tear that place down! I'm going to run away!" But Darley and Johnny didn't listen to her and still sent her to the nursing home. After Pan Xi was sent to the nursing home, she didn't run away, even though the matrons there would have been happy for her to escape, because Pan Xi had already made them helpless in a short time. Suddenly, one day, the whole nursing home was buzzing with excitement, saying that a beautiful young lady was coming to the nursing home to pick out an old woman to be her mother. When Pan Xi heard this, she felt that her chance to escape had come. She was determined that she would be chosen. She looked at the other old women, all dressed up. Some had combs in their hair, some had old lace draped over them, and some had on some worthless ornaments. Pan Xi felt sorry for them, how could they compete with Pan Xi Patterson, who used to be famous on stage? Pan Xi could always perform at any time, and this was of course a good opportunity for her to perform. On that day, the matron indeed led in a beautiful young lady. Pan Xi casually looked up. But unexpectedly, she couldn't help but panic. She seemed to have seen that young lady somewhere before... After thinking about it, she remembered... she had seen her in Darley's midnight court... Her name was Ala Banli, and she was a disreputable fan dancer. Now she was coming to the nursing home to choose an old woman to be her mother—that must be a kind of publicity stunt for them!
