<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本外交總動員之鳥瞰　舒·</h3>
<p>日本對美外交。旣有相當挽回其僵局之形勢。乃發爲外交總動員之舉。首先由外長電召駐華公使有吉明返日。面授機宣。駐美大使齋藤博。亦將繼有吉之後。駐法大使佐藤春夫不久亦罄一返。其餘大公使以及總領事級外交人員。設有必要。皆可許其返日請訓。就此種情勢作表面觀察。似不能不謂爲含有重大意義蓋日本週圍之國際關係。日趨緊張。各國漸漸注重於實力之整備。以備將來萬一之事變。以英國論。其遠東外交。原以對日提携爲中心。對俄如是。對華關係亦具此類傾向。然自九一八事變後。日本在遠東政治關係與棉織品消塲問題。皆顯示其與英帝國相對立。匪特英國在華市塲。已根本動搖。卽印度南洋以至於南非諸地。亦大有爲日本所侵略之慮。是以英國飛速建築新嘉坡軍港。而又積極奪回棉製品之市塲也。</p>
<p>美日外交。近以赫爾與齋藤互換外交公文。及菲利濱獨立批准之故。表示好轉之象。然美國建造龐大艦艇。仍不改其預定計劃。太平洋之黯淡風雲。僅能依外交上之應付。爲一時之晴霽。而政治上之對立。殊非片言可能折衝平衡也。不過因美日距離甚遠。經濟利益。猶未達十分尖銳之境地。故尚可勉圖一時之緩和阻遇近期的惡化耳。</p>
<p>在日本外交關係中形勢最急迫。而危險性最大者。莫不知爲日蘇之對立。蓋以日軍進占北滿後。沿黑龍江以迄烏蘇里江興凱湖一帶。到處皆伏有導火綫。隨時隨地有爆發意外之可能。加以日蘇兩國。根本政治觀念。絕不相容。日本旣借口嚴防赤化。處處藉武力以自衛。蘇聯爲戒備日軍侵略。亦轉其機輪於軍備之充實。而中東路問題。又梗塞其間。北海漁業。復時生異議。雖蘇聯不願挑戰。日本不敢輕於啓釁。但將來之危機。終無消除之辦法。是以日蘇關係。實爲遠東國際上不可醫治之癌腫。</p>
<p>日本軍閥審知此點。故第一卽竭其力之所能。以打開國際外交孤立之局。其凖備之初步。將從英國着手。蓋英日舊誼。與對蘇之共同利害問題。不無稍有關係。故政治上合作之可能性甚多。不過日本已不容抛開其經濟利得。棉業市已深入英屬殖民地自治領。英國又豈青讓步。矧英吉利宿稱功利主義國家。對日外交。焉能二致。然則英日關係。旣一刻難於轉佳。日人乃不能不在太平洋上尋覓出路。先就美國以求諒解。設試此舉初步有成。能更進而討論海軍比率。或延長華盛頓條約。或另立恊定。使太平洋上日美關係。不致再行惡化。則日本對蘇。卽多一層保障。</p>
<p>日本退出國際聯盟後。就日本軍國主義的觀點面論。可謂搏得勝利。但就外交立塲論。不可謂非一種重大之失敗也。在日軍閥初以爲一切問題。皆可以機槍大砲解决。旣而彼亦自知此事之妄謬。環顧國際關係複雜之歐洲。以及遍世界各地。皆滿布排日雾圍。形勢皆不利於日本。是以急欲改善在歐洲之國際外交。乃令佐藤返日。籌所以應付之方策。日之於歐美諸國。果能相當改善目前之惡傾向。同時又能轉換其對華交際者。則所謂新外交方針。或可樹立。惟對付蘇聯。恐未必有巧妙如意之手段耳。</p>

<h3>維持政權之眞意義</h3>
<p>（東京）齋藤内閣所以决定維持者、其眞意有種種之議論、其有力之理由、則齋藤首相之意見、以立憲政治應以政黨政治爲主義、本人雖因擔當非常時局、組織現閣、苟其使命旣畢、仍希望復歸於政黨政治、然觀政黨目下之狀態、縱令掛冠、政權到底不能歸於政黨、必出現中間内閣或官僚内閣、如是則没却現内閣組閣之意義、故决定維持、蓋首相之意、將待政黨更生、圓滿授受政權、（二日電通電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）據美國參院共和黨領袖波拉稱、如國會對於貨幣無一定之政策、則勢難停會、波氏預測參院必能通過達司之白銀案、根據達司之白銀案、則美國政府可以美國之農產品、換取外國之白銀、並規定該項白銀之價格、較普通市價爲高、波氏云、據韋勒氏提案規定、美國可月購白銀五○·○○○·○○○盎斯、以購滿一百萬盎斯或金銀比價達十六對一之限度爲止、故韋氏提案、可爲達氏案之附文云、據稱、行政當局提議之關稅案、甚爲重要、依據該案則總統有權與外國簽訂互惠商約、惟該案已被擱置、開議之期、須待四月十日左右、有人預測關稅案前途之荆棘尚多、是以該案今後之變化、必較在衆院時爲甚、然參院大多數領袖咸信必能修改該案、使白宫認爲滿意云、又聞參衆兩院共和黨領袖已决定拒絕行政當局增加新稅、據行政當局稱、自獨立機關經費案再度爲國會通過後、（卽恢復參加歐戰退伍軍人之恩俸與政府在職人員减薪之一部份）國家之負担因之驟增、故該項新稅實爲必要者云、惟參議員麥克奈冷與李特二人共同宣稱、國家預算之不能平衡、其錯誤在特别費用之無限制、並不在恢復退伍軍人之恩俸與在職人員之薪金云、（一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>第三期目錄</h3>
<p>１·小前言</p>
<p>２·一週情報</p>
<p>３·信　箱</p>
<p>４·道　謝</p>
<p>小前言　目交我們會到了一位本埠的讀者、一見面我們就請他對於讀書指導的工作的批評。他說：一批評嘸没格，不過，（讀書問答）要如何纔會使一般店員學徒都有興趣去讀呢？）我們於是問他：（你們店裏共有多少人？高興讀（讀書問答）的又有多少人呢？）他笑道”（店裏連高級職員共有一百六十多人，愛讀（讀書問答）的只有三四十人。而這三四十人中，眞正龍讀懂的還不過七八人呀！我們）聽了這話後，一面是歡喜，我們的工作竟能在一百六十中佔到四分之一的同情者；一面自然是恐懼與慚愧。原來我們的工作，還這般的不切實際。這明明白白就是對我們工作的批評，並且是極其公正的。某君的一個練習生，他本人就不能全懂（讀書問答）内所討論的一切、從他口中吐出的片言隻字，我們都認爲極可寳貴。我們正需要聽聽我們的基本讀者自己的意見。由是，我們對於今後的（讀書問答）不得不有以下的努力；第一是對於我們自己：（一）在文字表達方面，儘可能地求通俗，使讀的時候不吃力，（二）力避與一般生活隔離太遠的理論的討論，（三）多用實例解釋理論，少談原理原則。第二對於讀者方面，我們也有以下幾項希望。（一）（讀書問答）不一定是我們談得太深，卻是（讀書問答）的態度，比較一般小報要嚴肅些，它的内容，是理論上的探討，我們希望對（讀書問答）已有趣味的人，對於尚迷戀低級趣味讀物的人，常常引誘他們來看（讀書問答。）（二）對於（新名詞）（術語）及（理論本身，）我希望讀者盡力的吸收，艱苦的學習，不要太畏難，太保守。這些（新名詞）（術語）都是近代日常生活中發生的，我們要做個現代人，實在無法不用它，要讀近代書報、也必需能了解這些東西。（三）至於内容，我們不能降低到迎合低級趣味的水凖，這要請讀者，（迎頭趕上，）不要（趕不上）便不顧了。同時，我們還希望讀者能具體指出（讀書問答）中的錯誤。</p>
<p>一週情報　（一）本週參加的讀書同志一○人，内女同志一人。（二）收到討論的來件六十七封，覆出信四十二封。（三）要求組織讀書會的來信十封，由郵借部轉來要求本館出版一種經常刋物的來信六封。來部談話五人。（四）本部决定：Ａ舉行三個月以來讀者讀書生活調查，調查表决於十日前發出。Ｂ對於外埠本報讀者參加讀書指導部後經一月之時間，認爲眞的對於研究甚富興趣，同時不斷通信討論，并向本部提出讀書報告者，本部可介紹本館郵借部，享受借書的權利，但其乎續另定之。○凡不屬本部解答範圍内的問題，如要求介紹職業，詢問學校内幕，西文書報的介紹，對本報建議，及過於專門（如詢编紡機器的裝置，金魚的養法等。）等問題，以後槪不答覆。Ｄ（讀書問答）春假照常出版。</p>
<p>信箱　（一）致本部讀者：（一）在四月十五前，請填就本部三個月讀書生活調查表，送館，如久己未與本部通訊者，並請說明久未通信之原因，在三十日前不將覆信送館者，本部卽認作自願退出本部，當卽取消登記。（二）來信提出問題，可用（一）（二）（三）·······標出，一槪不用客氣話；不同性質的問題，請作二次提出。（三）請勿提出過於空洞，毫無内容的問題，最好根據某一書，某一報具體提出。（二）致申報讀者：（一）凡申報讀者與本部通信槪以貼有通信印花（卽每日附於（讀書問答）標題下者）爲有效；無印花者槪不答覆。（二）請問時注意（致本部讀者）第二三項之規定。（三）請代調查你們週圍讀（讀書問答）的人數及對（讀書問答）的意見。</p>

<h3>吸烟十誡</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>吸烟本來是傷腦敗胃的但是也有避瘟消穢的功效，右是成癮的人突然戒除很容易傳染病毒。現在爲防備尼哥了毒害，有十種要訣，請吸烟的人，十分注意。</p>
<p>一，乾燥的烟，霉化的烟，潮濕陳舊的烟。因爲尼哥丁容易遊離，就是吸時容易中毒。</p>
<p>二，一支烟吸到一半烟火熄滅後，切不可再吸，要吸就吸完，吸就捨棄。因爲烟吸到一半熄滅時，尼哥丁凝結於烟燼裏，這尼哥丁的毒，非常利害。</p>
<p>三，吸烟點火時，從自來火所發的綠烟，千萬不可吸進去凡是擦自來火燃着後，不可急急點烟，免得燐毒進口。</p>
<p>四，吸進烟氣，切忌閉口，從鼻孔通出因爲烟氣通鼻最容易傷腦。</p>
<p>五雪茄烟尼哥丁最多切宜禁忌若是烟癮很大的人應裝在長烟管上吸比較爲宜。</p>
<p>六食後空腹吸烟都不相宜飲酒時吸烟大忌。</p>
<p>七憤怒不快的時候不可吸烟因爲精神與奮與鬱抑容易受尼哥丁毒害。</p>
<p>八吸各種紙烟時應當備長烟嘴使尼哥丁積留在烟嘴裏比較不容易直接吸進其他防除尼哥丁的藥品詳觀下面所說。</p>
<p>九一天最多吸紙烟五支多則有害一年内應檢查身體有否中尼哥丁的毒害。</p>
<p>十在室内吸烟應流通空氣切不可緊閉窗戸使烟霧瀰漫嗶</p>
<h3>尼哥丁中毒</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>我們吸烟的人應當要曉得各種烟中尼哥丁的毒質不過尼哥丁的多少是照各國所出的品類而不同的現在把各國運華的烟所含的毒質分記如下：埃及的紙烟含有百分之二·二至一·五英法美之烟葉，含有百分之二○至三·五·威忌尼亞雪茄烟含有百分之三·五·勃利丹尼加烟葉含有百分之二里加里耶美佳烟葉含有百分之一·二波爾德利尼哥烟葉含有百分之一·二瑞士伯力沙哥烟葉含有百分之二至四吐司加尼紙烟含有百分之二至四東洋烟葉含有百分之　·侂至一·二法國紙烟含有百分之二至三·五英美紙烟含有百分之一·一至二·九。克里米亞半島所產的烟葉尼哥丁含有量爲最多我國浙江的新昌烟葉尼哥丁含有量爲最少。尼哥丁的多少可看烟葉的顏色淡色者爲多暗色者少。尼哥丁是無色無臭的東西倘若放在空氣中變爲褐色尼哥丁中毒的致死量爲○·○三至○·○六格蘭姆就是一大張烟葉與五支雪茄烟中含有的分量可是成牆成慣的人到了五六倍也不要緊的若是把烟中的民哥丁减了百分之○·一那就失去烟的本味因爲烟中的香氣大半是尼哥丁變成的。不過並不是香氣都是尼哥丁譬如坎及的紙烟香氣很富而尼哥丁含有量很少說到尼哥丁中毒的急性症狀是瀕面蒼白盜汗流涎吐沫惡心吐瀉血壓降低虚脫無力等。但是尼哥丁的禮讚者說尼哥丁能剌激交感神經能從副腎旺盛阿特來那林的分泌可以增進血糖與血壓。至於尼哥丁中毒的預防法可服些丹銀或用鹽化阿姆尼亞姆百分之○·三或用枸椽酸鐵阿姆尼亞灌入烟管吸口就是用棉花浸過上列數種樂品塞在吸口内那末可以也除尼哥丁中毒了。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鵑</p>
<p>介紹原著者丨丨清德齡公主</p>
<p>伊和Ｍr·　T·　White曾經生過一個兒子而在去年春間不幸這個華母所生的美國少年又患病死了。不用說我們這位已被遺棄的老婦人的心坎上又受了更深一層的創痛所以當伊把這一部著作物付印的時候伊特地在第一頁上寫了一句極沉痛的話就是ＩnLovingMemory　ofmy　son　Thaddens　Raymond　Whiteo（爲紀念我的親愛的亡兒柴杜士　蒙懷而德）</p>
<p>現在就是伊一個人形單影隻的卜居在紐約僅僅的依靠者出賣文章的收入過日子。但是聽說伊並没有回國的意思。這就是原著者德齡公主的略傳。</p>
<p>上面我不是說過他們姊妹兄弟一共有五位一四兩人已死還有第二第五兩位却也同樣的享過一番盛名。而且這一回譯者從事譯述的時候他們兩位都曾因吾友唐雲帆君的介紹給我以極可感激的指導。在這裏我也可以給讀者介紹一番在爲在這部書中間他們兩位也是很重要的一份子勛齡現年六十歲就是原著者的二哥。他是承襲他父親的爵位的人在西太后當國的時候很受過寵過。同時他還是一位前輩的攝影家對於攝影學極有研究凡慈禧一生所照的像片没有一幀不是他照的。此刻在北平過着很舒服的寓公生活。</p>
<p>容齡又名山壽公主（係慈祝指萬壽山而賜者）乃是原著者的胞妹行五現爲唐寳潮將軍之夫人在北平社交界裏算是很出風頭的一位。伊也曾在内廷給西太后充過女官後來也曾用英文寫過一部書呌做（香妃）在歐美各國至今還受許多人的歡迎和稱賞。</p>
<p>這部書因爲有了他們兩位的指導譯者竟能一字不漏的把它繙譯出來實在是非常可喜的。然而譯筆的粗劣還是不能掩飾。慚愧慚愧丨（二）</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十六回</p>
<p>慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懷人</p>
<p>這一句呌着却讓桂枝嚇了一大跳趕緊抽出手絹來擦着眼涙口裏答道：没有作什麽？雨點吵着人睡不着我想找一點活作還没有動手呢。江氏已是走進堂屋來用手推着臥室門道：你打開來罷我還有話和你說呢。桂枝本想不打開門來然而母親偷着前來探望過了那必然是有用意的若不讓他進來那就更會疑心了。於是先將煤油燈的燈燄撚得更大一點然後開着門放江氏進來。江氏走進門先仰了頭向桂枝臉上看着道：孩子你怎麽哭了？桂枝强笑道：我没有哭呀！江氏道：你怎麽没哭我在窗門外邊看了半天了。桂枝也知道是硬賴不了的便歎了一口氣道：我在這兒想着呢。現在咱們這裏都是這樣的凉了。我想着口子外面必定是格外的凉。自强從去了以後就是到的那天來了一封信現在不知道他是不是還在喜峰口呢？江氏道：這是你過慮了。他没有什麽事老寫信給你作什麽？他要是掉了地方還能够不向家裏來信嗎？桂枝也没作聲將桌上那張相片檢了起來依然掛在壁上。却用一個食指把相片上所滴的眼涙都揩擦乾凈過去。江氏站到他身邊來用手按住了他的手臂低聲道：孩子你是個聰明人怎麽這樣想不開呢？你公公已經是日夜懷記着你們的事你這樣一來不是給老人家添心事嗎？（三五三）</p>

<h3>怎樣超越危機</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>若眞有（事實）的（危機），（尖銳）化了（緊張）化了又怎樣呢？答覆這問題也容易，仍然是一古事不但雙方，簡直是多方於己不利的卤某和尚問（求道）：（進前三步如何）？答覆是：（撞頭碰額）丨（退後三步如何）？丨（一落千丈），（不進不退如何）？丨（立地死滅）丨那麽應該怎樣呢。！······</p>
<p>以上是兀先生所作（危機）一文的末叚。（應該怎樣呢）？後文是没有了誰能答覆這問題呢？</p>
<p>在没有萬全的答案以前，我可以提出我的意見來。但我不用自己的言語來表示我的意見，因爲恰有現成的言語可以備用。這言語，曾見於前些時的（自由談），包含在瑞子先生所介紹的安徽民間情歌的一首裏：那首情歌的前半說：</p>
<p>（天上大星對小星，十八歲大姊尋郎到如今，也不知走過多少黑夜路，也不知受過多少恐和驚、站着又怕人看見，　着又怕蚊子釘，走到前村狗兒咬，走到後村老虎哼）。　　道也是眞所謂（多方於己不利）（那麽應該怎樣呢）？了，但末了却說：</p>
<p>（只好大起胆子望前找，喚郎一聲駡一聲）。</p>
<p>（只好大起胆子望前找）。這也就是我的意見了。</p>
<p>兀先生文中也曾提及的愷撒，他的一個故事，便可爲此語作註：</p>
<p>當羅馬的元老院發出了不准愷散回羅馬的命令之後，身在高盧的愷撒，就貿然舉兵反叛了。但是到了界於高盧與羅馬之間的Ｒubicon河的時候他不免彷徨起來：渡河麽？那就違抗了元老院的命令，非實行反叛不可了，然而龐貝之勢正强，勝負實未可知。轉回高盧麽？則屈服元老的命令，實所不甘。况且日後總不免被他們所殲滅······</p>
<p>（應該怎樣呢；）老慮的結果，愷撒終於大呼Ａlea　Zacta　est丨（把命運作孤注一擲罷！）而渡河了。</p>
<p>倘不大起胆子向前，還有什麽辦法呢？像駝鳥一般彎彎曲曲地在沙漠上跑：或在把頭躱在翼膀中間罷？然而牠們常爲獵者更容易地擒獲。</p>
<p>末了，只有後退一路了。但如果後面還有可退的穏路，那算什麽危機！</p>
<h3>半天的功課</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>（靜眞，還不起來，快到七點了。）</p>
<p>聽到母親在堂屋喊、我就從夢中驚醒過來、太陽已經照到窗檯上。也不知怎的，二年來早上上學，總是缺少興致，不像從前把這件事看的比吃飯還要重要，生怕晚去一會子工夫受到先生的責斥。現在，完全不是那樣了，上學，上課對於我，只是一件極平常的事情，一味地在敷衍着。依自己的本意，早就不想進學校受這亡國奴的敎育了，情願在家裏閒着，但是後來仔細一想，旣然不能脫離目前遭受的惡劣環境，到外面去求學，去走走，那，與其在家裏徒然消磨着日子，倒不如到學校裏去，並且藉此可以領略到，認識到現在的亡國奴敎育和從前的敎育有着怎樣的不同，以及今後亡國奴敎育的發展，是經過什麽樣的路向。因此，二年來還在佔着名義上的學生，眞的，說句良心話，自己眞就從没有過一次安心看過功課；這也許就是爲什麽我會在早上晚晚起身的原因。</p>
<p>抬頭看看擺在身旁桌子上的小鐘，它是曾經有一次被闖進來檢查的日本兵碰碎了玻璃罩的，後來又換上一片新的，鐘面上清清楚楚地指示給我到七點鐘只差五分了。是的，時候不早了，該是我起身的時候了。</p>
<p>（啊！我就起來，母親。）</p>
<p>答應着母親的喊聲，就翻身起床了，穿衣服時，忽然想起昨天訓育主任報告的話，他是要同學們在今早七點半鐘準得到校，是的，像他所說的，今天是九月十五日，是（新國家）被日本承認的一週紀念日，要開個盛大的慶祝會的。時間在不留意中，過去了五分鐘，正是七點，不容許我再多躭擱工夫，儘半黠鐘的時間，急忙地盥漱，吃飯，然後就和母親告别了：（母親，我走了。）</p>
<p>路上依然和往日一樣的平靜，不同的是每家門口全掛出了一幅新國旗，迎着九月的晨風，不時地飄動。到處的牆上，都不缺少五彩紙張的標語，因爲顏色是那樣的耀眼，有些過路的人，就運用自己認字的才能，停住脚步念誦着。</p>
<p>（慶祝新國承認一週紀念。）</p>
<p>（慶祝承認要感謝友帮盛意。）</p>
<p>（大日本帝國萬歲。）</p>
<p>（大滿洲國萬歲。）</p>
<p>（勦匪，安民，實行王道政治。）</p>
<p>聽别人念誦完時，我已經看過兩遍了，我打算再看一遍，看看還有别的標語没有，到底又讓我看到在另外一面牆上，新貼大幅的廣告，清清楚楚的顯出兩行墨字：</p>
<p>（九·一八二週紀念。）</p>
<p>（九·一五一週紀念。）</p>
<h3>客家情歌</h3>
<p>— 秋濤</p>
<p>（一）打也唔（註）怕駡唔愁，前門打來後門溜；打得皮熔筋唔爛，唔死唔願把哥丢！</p>
<p>（二）敢放白鴿敢上鈴，敢同情哥路上行；那人敢說姦情事，官司打到南京城。</p>
<p>（三）唔怕死來唔怕生，唔怕丈夫斷脚踭；斷了脚踭留脚趾，兩人有命總要行。</p>
<p>（註）（唔）字與（不）字意同</p>
<h3>别</h3>
<p>— 微芒</p>
<p>我們默默的，悽然的坐在窗下。　　暮色已倫入室内，院内是一片靜寂。</p>
<p>我們幾乎欣幸着能在這個日子裏得獨佔了這院内的黄昏。同時，我們也不免在這黄昏的岑寂裏，感着一些深切的悲凉的情緒。</p>
<p>兩人要說的話眞是太多了，我們還是新婚不久的一對。相望着，涙水都充滿在我們眼裏我伸出手，將她的一隻手緊緊地握住了。面前，是一個被包，一隻箱，和一個網籃。我差不多要哭了！</p>
<p>這幾天來，我看了她那個强爲歡笑的樣兒，心中難過的情形，若非親歷其境的，誰又能懂得？她每每會在我們獨自談話之中，含着眼涙走到隔室中去。她不讓她的纞别的情緒十分的在我面前流露出來，她控制着自己；我也曾經對她說過，關於收拾行李的事，請她不要費心，這在我是太平常了，我可以在一兩點鐘之内將牠清理得好好的。</p>
<p>不想，下午我上市上去了一趟，回來時，網籃，衣箱，被包早給她安排妥貼了。</p>
<p>她曾打開箱子給我看，要穿的衣服都擱入了，而且在箱蓋内還貼有一張恏相手寫好的衣單。網籃内的書籍，到是没有一本不是我想帶走的，墨盒也擦得亮光的，丨裏面還預備好了白白的綿紙，筆也是幾管配上了銅筆帽的新筆。</p>
<p>我不必在這兒說後來我在我的衣服袋裏找出了一方她她常用的乎巾時的情懷，就在這時，我也禁不住傷心了。</p>
<p>我的母親死得很早，我也没得一個姊妹。家庭，從前對於我，簡直只是一個冷淡的記憶；我的心從没有在這里温暖過。當時，我又何曾想到，離别會如今日這般的苦惱着我？</p>
<p>我悄悄的說：</p>
<p>（放了假，我就卽刻回來。）說出了，我就知道這是一句蠢話，不料她却因了這句蠢話，感情到底制止不住了，丨她伏在我肩上哭了。</p>
<p>我親着她，然而，我找不出一句更聰明的安慰她的話！</p>
<h3>論翻譯（續）</h3>
<p>— 噸</p>
<p>那麽有疑難又怎樣呢？或翻原文原解之字典，更好是用顧問，更好是用外國工程師！没有法子，學問上是無架子可擺，無捷徑（Ｒoyal　way），用不得權術的！二。口譯勝於筆譯，合譯勝於獨譯。丨丨除别有會心之文學作品，如詩歌，覺得只有一己能譯了外，普通二三人（人太多有時也不便）志同道合，互相參究，容易有興趣，用力少而見功多。但也頗要平心靜氣，爭鬧不得！打不得！獨自吃重，寂寞的捱着大著，雖可欽佩，究竟可不必也！還有一點小經騐，爲譯書者說。卽是翻譯有時倒不麻煩，一到鈔謄一部龐然巨製，倒覺工作沈重起來了，簡單的法子，修改之後，請人代鈔。</p>
<p>嚴幾道論翻譯，有三原則：卽信，達，雅。暗合藝術上之眞，善，美，三原則。可以奉爲楷模。信者眞實，達者明顯，雅者漂亮。現在我們看唐譯佛經，尤其是諸論，偈未嘗不驚奇古人之高深。其說理之處，如稍慣於那種文法，覺得眞是一字不移，一字不增，一字不減。路德與彌難希東共譯希臘文的聖經，用工之苦，往往四日翻出三行，便因此確定了德文之基礎。中文翻出的（官話）新舊約，也是佳製。大槪信達之後，自成風格，開出一種新的文體，是意中事。也許求古人將佛經翻成另一種更淺近更曉暢的文體，使哥兒們容易了解，覺得（順眼）實不可能。信可以力求而得，達却頗需要天才，Ａ翻之則不達，Ｂ譯之而達。大有本領上之懸殊。雅則只能靠天，故意裝作不出的。不過旣自有風格，當然也成一個樣子吧。因此又抄出彥琮法師的八個條件：</p>
<p>夫預翻譯，有八備十條：</p>
<p>一，誠心受法，志在益人。</p>
<p>二，將踐勝塲，先牢戒足。</p>
<p>三，文詮三藏，義貫五乘。</p>
<p>四，傍涉文史，工綴典詞，不過魯拙。</p>
<p>五，襟抱平恕，器量虚融，不好專執。</p>
<p>六，沈於道術，淡於名利，不欲高衒。</p>
<p>七，要識梵言，不墜彼學。</p>
<p>八，傳閱蒼雅，粗諳篆隷，不昧此文。</p>
<p>在昔盛世，翻譯之事視爲一種極崇高，偉大的事業，翻譯者皆爲（大師）。這工作與宗敎相連，覺得與身心性命有關，所以雖甚辛苦，但成績特别好。佛經中錯字少，大槪也是這種原由。今人翻譯西洋著作，缺乏這種信心，雖有人以此餬口，但目的在賣錢，便無異於經商，經商則只要花樣多交貨快。顧不到本質，更顧不到一書翻出後對於讀者的影響。看現代西洋人彼此翻譯各種著作，更使我們驚奇。大槪凡甲國有的較重要的著作，乙國必將其翻去了，因之翻譯而不得著者的許可，便視同偷竊。英譯浮士德有四十種譯本之多，甚至日本人也譯有托爾斯太，莎士比亞諸文學家的全部著作，眞使咱們愧死！</p>
<p>有誰眞切地自覺在負着紹介西方文化的使命而嚴肅地以翻譯爲畢生工作的嗎？我們需要這種（大師）！（完）</p>
<h3>春之街</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>没有太陽又不下雨，春季里常有這日子。女人的肉體顫動着：神秘之街是永遠帶着芳香的。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>十字路口：這邊是摩托卡，那郔是獨輪車；你瞧這風景，有着一世紀的距離吧？</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>當大都會的夜曲雜奏時，人肉與獸性搏鬧；氣息里藏着無限罪惡；一些人踏着爵士沉迷，一些人忍受着飢寒奮起！</p>
<h3>回家</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>丨無窗室隨筆之二丨</p>
<p>忽然心血來朝，覺得非回家不痛快。自己這樣離離奇的行徑，實在是一種不能出口的隠衷促成的，譬如連夜的失眠和無端的心跳不是没法呌人了解的嗎？一個病着的心决不是常人的心所能測量的，如果你照實的表白了你的心，那是要被人家非笑的，我吃透這種味，所以每在想做一椿　得非常的事，總是用别種理由對大家解釋過去。</p>
<p>這次国顺家的理由說是爲了過清明。我覺得這滿可以塞住大家的口，因爲這理由似乎十分正大。清明節不是掃墓的日子嗎？而且地土的買賣在北方的習俗也須得在這個佳節以前决定，我的家庭我就是惟一的主人，是大家所共知的。</p>
<p>（清明節的鄉村眞是詩意的啊！）大家都這樣地說了，這實在也有點說破了我的心的一半。</p>
<p>直跑了一天，頭昏昏的，過重的失眠和回家快樂預感的興奮使得臉發燒。晚上回到無窗室，呵，已經有三個客人早塞滿這小屋了。我覺到了高興。因爲這三個人都是我所喜歡的，都是同好。他三個躺在牀板上，我依着桌子站着，談，談，話頭没有一定的方向，然而每一句每一個字都是從心裏流出的，都是有眞味的。（十點人！）大家彷彿都有點驚異，他們要走，我送他們出了大門。</p>
<p>（無窗室也留不住了嗎？）</p>
<p>（留不住了。）人走得已經遠了。</p>
<p>回頭到上房去辭行。姑媽有點驚怪。</p>
<p>（穿洋服的那三個人是誰呀？）</p>
<p>（是朋友。）</p>
<p>（這小屋子因爲你而光輝了。（談笑有鴻儒，往來無白丁，）這間屋可以名之曰陋室了。）</p>
<p>火車載着我逃開了都市。朝曦照着大野，大野上是一片綠，一片生機，我深吸一口氣，彷彿第一次見到太陽。心也輕鬆了。</p>
<p>八十里路的途程，車不過走兩點鐘，然而我不坐它，這裏邊有我的理由，也是不能對人告訴的。我坐了小車。任它在不平的古道上顚來倒去，顚得骨子都有點酸，我高興這樣。麥苗還没不了烏鴉，直從脚下綠到天邊。一種泥土的香味從車輪上捲入鼻孔，這是一種至高的享受。長堤上一行垂柳一眼望不到頭，黄黄的，上面已經有春烏在呼喚行人了。解了凍的小河，流得格外活潑，浣紗的村女想看人先紅了先己的臉。一些裸體的小孩子在忙着建魚梁，快樂得拍着光腿。我想跳下來加入進去。我是生於鄉村的，這生活是我童年生活的寫眞。</p>
<p>老遠裏望見了故鄉的山，心用山測量故鄉的遼近。到了家已是黄昏了，朦朧中有許多孩子在晚風中收風箏。</p>
<p>小燈下，圍着一羣人說故事，我的心平安了。然而她們說了更多驚心的現實故事，給我以先知道的鄉村破產情形以更多的證據，晚上我倒想生了，然而又不敢睡，把心和耳朶連在一起，側在枕頭上聽狗的動靜！</p>

<h3>紗花　四月紗發現　十年來之新低價</h3>
<p>丨一百六十九元丨</p>
<p>紗市續跌、形勢頗虚、因廠商不能團結、解入交易所之紗太鉅、某廠之多頭被其壓迫、將吸進之額掃數了結、致檯在鬆懈、一般散戸羣爭抛賣、因之市盛一蹶不振矣、但現紗交易較爲活動、受環境不良影響、市價依然軟弱、且四月份老標紗發現近十年來之新低峯、又敲破七十元關口矣、</p>

<h3>標花市疲中帶堅</h3>
<p>棉市日向軟途推進、以紗市日跌、廠需停滯、致人心不振、花價較紗價爲高、新做多者仍缺、但有一部份以美棉有觀好消息、新抛亦鮮、故市勢尚疲中帶堅、不過棉價比較太高、實銷暗澹耳</p>

<h3>金融　洋拆依然混沌</h3>

<h3>小絞米待價而沽</h3>
<p>客秈到頭已少</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、來源湘贛已稀、其他各路亦復减色、因日前本客停頓、市價步小、客販一致外望、湘贛兩省產價高昻、更難合劃也、去路方面近日爲春節假期、客戸到市不多、本街亦在外望、全日成交無幾、市面暫時擯滯、昨市福州應酬南京機秈四百零五包、各路糙二百多包、温州辦蕪湖米四百包、本街去機晚糙秈等三百多包、行情高貨帶砌、因貨主以到頭减少、產價昻漲而喊高也、如蕪湖機秈及南京秈米均步好數分、洋米在洋商乎中者業已結與行家、安利所存之小絞三萬五千包、亦以六元半之價售清、惟行家心思看好、大多囤在乎中、少數配與甬帮、目下關稅實行、後定不劃、滬存不多、囤戸看好、昨本街辦去回籠小絞五百包、仍開六元七角半、</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言新道德與（舊道德）  際雲　　（新）與（舊）二個字，當然以時間作標凖，相互比較而肯定的，有形的體的物質，因時間性的關係，格外表現得明白，如新衣舊衣，新屋舊屋，以至新人舊人，新國舊國，新中華舊中華，何莫非以創造和胚胎的先後，去分别的，就是無形無體的丨抽象的丨東西，也因發生期的遲早，而區别新舊，如新思想舊思想，新主義舊主義，都不能逃出時間性的定定。　　也有不受時間性所制止，不變常形，不改常態，千百年前如此，千百年後也如此，灼灼的太陽，億萬春秋不减其威，皎皎的明月，億萬春秋不减其華，所以新太陽舊太陽，新月舊月等等稱謂，不過做弄文舞墨的資料而已，形體上實在分不出新舊的，擴大了這個定例，就可以明白（凡是）一樣東西，因爲分子間組織的嚴密，决不會受到歲月的侵蝕，可以常常維持它的（新。）　　（道德）是做人的寳鑑，自有它的存在的價值，保持它的尊嚴，和日月同樣地分不出新舊，我們硬拿没有持久性的東西做榜樣，分什麽（新道德）和（舊道德，）未免言之無理。　　幾千年前說（做人要有誠信，）難道二十世紀以至一百世紀的做人，就可以欺詐行事麽，從前的修身治己之道，很有認爲陳腐的，豈知一旦違反了它，就受到离心和環境的制裁，所以道德是絕對的新的，無所謂（新道德）和（舊道德），况且旣稱（舊道德）了，不知（新道德）在那裏，也可說（什麽呌做新道德。）　　入世未深意志不堅强的，曲解了這個問題，不知造出了多少的罪惡，我要文縐縐地說，（始作俑者，其無後乎。）　　退而言之，新衣服旣没有做好，還是穿一件舊的，新房子旣没有造成，還是安於舊的，新榖未登塲，還是繼着吃陳米，這樣地變通一下，最低限度。决不致受凍受寒和受饑吧，大家能舉一反三，社會上要太平得多多。看了清心女校演劇以後  方之中　　丨（黑蝙蝠）演出之評價丨　　雖然過去我與清心男中有過一學期歷史。然而對於近相對峙的清心女中，始終是可望而不可卽，嗣後咫尺天涯，連遥望也少眼福了。昨日探知該校演劇，又係老友應雲衛先生導演，觀光的想念，支配了我的動向。　　電車在料峭的春寒裏疾馳着，一會兒把我送到跨龍路了，跨龍路卸下了從前的狹小骯髒，閃出肥大潔白的臂膞，馬路的兩邊，男女兩校仍舊對峙着，祗是氣勢較前更雄偉了。抵清心女中的大門，有幾位看客是被傳達室阻進了。我就拿出名片會應導演。傳達和氣地招待我進去。一入門，這兒就顯現着異國的情調，綠油油的草地，嵌在四面行人路的中間，路上是一羣一羣藍布校服的女生徘徊着，細語着。晚風從路柳的垂條上飄來，頗有幾分寒意。單衣的我，老實有些吃不消，祗好忽忙地隨着傳達走上了第三樓大禮堂。　　這兒裝置舞臺的都是常見的朋友，我的找應，原爲不得其門而入，現在熟人多了。於是打發了傳達回原地。朋友們都忙碌地在爲（奇怪的屋子）工作着，在没這屋子有出現奇怪以前，實在是一間精美的客廳！　　這時觀衆先後降臨了：就中多爲該校學生，極少數是家長及其親屬，鶯鶯燕燕之聲，喧闐四座。移時紅幕輕啓，現出八個女孩的跳舞，活潑天眞，博得掌聲不少，接着就是話劇（黑蝙蝠）。在Ｐrogramme上除舞蹈和音樂之外，話劇有兩個：一是“Ouality　Street”一是（黑蝙蝠）。前一個劇聽說昨晚已經演過了。（不禁使我生着絕大的失望）今晚只有一幕三塲的（黑蝙蝠）。　　（黑蝙蝠）的劇情與時代的意義、我想用不着說了，反正這是一個老劇本，並且要是使你看過了（古屋疑雲）或（霍桑探案）的影片，那是與這没有多少異樣的：劇情的曲折離奇，情調的變幻恐怖，這差不多偵探劇的公式，同樣，這裏荒僻的張海亭的别墅裏。在夜靜更闌（來了些不速之客）；由黑蝙蝠喬裝的僞稽查，又有由眞偵探改扮的報館訪員，有企圖分贓得愛的徐裕光，也有（怪誕的楊大公律師）。（有在逃的吕祥甫的女兒），復有張海亭的夫人及女僕和内姪孫鈞，更有凑熱鬧的名妓小金花，匯集這些（名流），於是（發生了不少駭人聽聞的事件丨丨窗上的黑影，樓梯上的白光，電燈電話綫的被割，電話没有打自己會響，蒙面人的發現，銀行贓欵的搜尋，戀愛的爭執，馬棚裏失火，······徐裕光被人暗殺，結果，壁上還發現了黑蝙蝠······）全劇的佈局，使觀衆的情緒逐漸緊張，巴望到此案的（大白）。我眞佩服應雲衛先生，他不單是一個富有經騐的導演家，而且是一個富有手腕的政治家，他知道清心女中是（神道設敎），所以才選這一個適當的劇本，同時東方的巴黎丨丨上海，僅有的是奇怪的盜案，也應當來一個（四海聞名）萬人歡喜的大偵探纔能保存市面的安全，何况這兒的張海亭，張夫人，楊律師，孫鈞，吕祥甫及其女兒，都是良心主義者　，（放下屠刀，立地成佛），吾主耶穌，是有着這樣仁慈的度量的。　　在演出上，這種塲面，總算偉大而精美的，演員就整個說來，以少舞臺經騐的中學生的演出，成績總算不錯（如果較嚴格的分析起來，飾張海亭的徐裕光，飾吕祥甫的女兒的某女士，以及那位女僕，飾黑蝙蝠和飾楊大公的，都很盡職，飾張升的雖太做作，那是美中不足。這一切雖說是導演的成績，同時演員們的努力。也是不可抹殺的。至於燈光，在這種恐怖塲面，我以爲應當多用脚光，另以Ｓpot　light從側面改換色調，空氣要緊張的多。本劇直到雷雨交作，頂點的到來，除了全暗外，不曾轉換。我認爲是其缺陷。　　末了，我們還得向清心的當局說一句，照歷史上說，宗敎和藝術，原是有着密切關係的，我希望以後開放一面，讓有戲劇天才的學生們，多得些發展的機會。鬍鬚與女人  述古　　普通一般審美的觀感：男人老態的顯明象徵，從面部下頰的鬍鬚這一具體的現象可表現一個輪廓出來。因爲如此，所以當今好些男士們所最惶恐而焦慮的，便是那（滿面于思）的東西。卽使不幸偶生徵髭，也必得使用（保險刀片）之類的器具，除惡務盡地給掃個精光。不過它是（野火燒不盡）的，過上兩天，便又蓬勃地滋蔓起來了。據說近因化學日益昌明，美容術也緊隨而進步了，現在市坊間已發行一種什麽藥水，用之一塗，鬍鬚包可斷根，我雖然没領敎過，恐也未可盡信。　　男人之所以疾惡於鬍鬚也，其理由似乎也還平正。無非要表示自己的青春尚未消失，藉以招引異性的垂青而便進行某種工作。據一般老於此道者之言，</p>

<p>現在情塲中失意的男人，倒有不少是吃了鬍鬚這撈什子的苦頭，是則鬍鬚之關係於人生幸福的前途，亦旣巨且廣矣。　　可是當你巡禮於馬路的時候，往往見有一些（滿面于思）的老翁與妙齡少女挽臂同行或比肩並坐的事實，這並非高貫小姐特别賞識這些（美髯公），而是含有若干銅臭的氣味的，當作又一說法，不在普通兩性正當結合之列的。　　本來男人有鬍鬚與女人没有鬍鬚，都是生理上的一種自锛現象。所以契　夫說：（男人没有鬍鬚就和女人的鬍鬚同樣的不適宜。）鬍鬚在男人生理上所居部位之重要，由此不難想見一般。考中國的古書裏，有婦人生鬚等怪誕事實的紀載，事固出於世所稀有，然亦未能信而有徵。且我國素有鬚眉男子之美稱，辭源上說：男子之美在於鬚，故謂男子爲鬚眉。凖茲以談，男子的美的表徵旣在於鬚，那麽鬚與女人便搆成了相當的　　關係　至少每個女子，見到了男子的鬍鬚，不宜先　一種厭惡的觀念。　　我似乎還記得有人曾這樣說過：有情愛的兩性，女人一見男子的鬍鬚，每喜撫摸以示其愛慕之意。此無他，蓋以營養不足或發育不全的人，多半少鬚，男子有鬚，足以佐證其生殖機能已經成熟，完成了一個頂天立地的男子的資格。所以女人愛一個無鬚的美男子，倒不如愛一個有鬚的大丈夫，意義較爲深刻，趣味倍覺濃郁。這些說話，已深深地剖明了女人與鬍鬚的深切的關係，我雖不是（女子心理學專家），不理解女人於鬍鬚的態度的究竟，然而總覺得這有些言之成理，不是什麽向壁虚搆的空論。　　無如我國一般時髦女子，在戀愛塲中，却偏偏憎惡男子有鬍鬚，斤斤注意於此（自然有些得在例外），這眞未免太歪曲了事實的眞義了。洗衣婦  麟年　　從樓窗上望下去，總可以看見有一個少婦的背影在那裏洗滌着衣服。她是多麽勤懇的啊！從没有看見他偷懶過，她總是用雙手搓，用板刷擦，肥皂的白沫濺上了她的面龐上，但是她似乎不自覺的仍在搓擦。　　她因爲整天價用手的緣故，所以她的手，已變成粗糙的了，然而她的臉是白晳的，雖然没有加上一些人工的修飾，但是她自有天然的容顏保留着。　　於是惹了幾個醜臉的癩蝦蟆流涎了。　　（嫂子，這件髒衣服給我洗得乾凈些。香水？有香水的話，請你潑上些，香噴噴的。）　　（哈，香水的香帕没有大嫂子的手香呢！）　　一陣尖刺的獰笑，使她俯下了頭漲紅着臉。　　（媽的，咱老子有拳頭，誰調戲咱老子的老婆，請嘗嘗咱的拳頭！）　　她的丈夫常喝飽了老酒，對一般取笑她的無賴咆哮着。他的確有力氣的，要是發牛性子的時候。他曾經打過一個扭住他妻子調戲的男子，因此坐了幾天牢　，但是他仍舊不怕，然而有幾個無賴就怕定他了。　　當他們正在厚着臉調笑的時候，又見老孫丨丨她的丈夫，拐一個灣兒踱來，他似乎又瞧見這幕怪劇了，所以已在瞪着眼冒火，他們就識相地乖乖的溜走了。　　　　對付無賴固然是兇狠的，但有時他的脾氣却怪和氣的，對於忠厚的人們。所以收衣服是他的責任。並且他不苟取一文，不爽日期，因此博得衆口交譽，他的生意，也挺興盛的。　　一次，老孫照例挑着擔兒去收衣服。他的娘子不偷懶的工作。　　（砰！）　　一個金錢砲摜在她的身旁，無疑，她是受驚了，回過頭來，原來是一個孩子。　　（孫嫂子）不論老的小的都這樣稱呼她。　　　（孫嫂子，去，有好幾件衣服給你洗。）　　她見是生意上門，所以氣平心和地賠着笑：　　（等老孫回來了，你再來喊吧！）　　（不爹和娘要出去，他們出去了跟誰拿？）　　終於她放不下生意不做，就喊隔壁的小香子看管着正在洗的衣服，她就跟着那孩子走了。　　一小時後，老孫回來了，小香子把那回事告訴他，他仍喝他的酒，似乎没留意地的。　　直到夜，他纔發了牛性子的，去找尋他的老婆，但是小香子没認識與孫嫂子去的那個孩子是那一家的，所以他結果是乾急。　　下一天，孫嫂子蓬散着頭髮回來，她是被人欺侮的了。她哭訴給老孫聽，她不幸染上污點了。老孫不等她說完，早暴燥如雷的趕到了係嫂子被欺侮的地方。　　老孫去的時候，是一個堅實的伙子，然而，給黄包車帶回來的是一隻病狗了。　　一星期後，老孫等傷勢略好了後，就帶了他的妻子孫嫂子脫離了那惡藪，回到鄉下，祇有小香子知道，他們回去的生活，是去恢復耕耘幾畝荒田。　　於是在我們的弄裏就失了那位洗衣婦的踪跡，再看不到肥皂沫濺到她的晳白的面皮上了。流浪兒傳（十七）  陳靜生製可憐的孩子們也曾有過家，和家裏　的小白狗　敵人的飛機毁了他們的家拉瓜  子午　　磨好了墨，正正衣襟，坐下來，極想寫些什麽，待提起筆來，却又無話可說。其實，心裏儘有許多話要想說，一到嘴邊不是因爲不敢說，便是覺得不消說而重又縮子進去。待要眞個（閉口無言）一些也不說吧，未免辜負了這一番磨墨握管的誠意。如此是非找話說不可了，若找話說，則又捨拉瓜莫屬。（拉瓜是北方一句土語，意思是說空話。）　　（摩登）兩字在四五年之前，已經見過，不過懂得它的原義的人還很少，想不到於四五年之後的今日，竟會如此走紅起來，這也該是它的鴻運當道。在一般人心目中，一提到了這兩個字，就會感覺到有一種無窮的，不可思議的美妙。從前，他們用（浪漫）兩字來形容某人的，今而換用了（摩登）兩字來代替着，一方面固然是覺得這兩字的意義來得廣闊些，而另一方面則因爲它更摩登些。但是我尚有以爲未足者，是它的時間性太暫，而多說亦未免有些（熟湯氣。）我認爲（摩登）應當退遜，新接任的該是（非歹。）君不見：（這是一九三五式）的晃子在一九三四年裏用着嗎？　　廣告的法術，眞是愈來愈妙，竟令人莫明其（妙）。某大藥房的大廉價大贈品廣告上，有這麽三句：（今日贈品，妻財子祿，有求必應。）又四馬路某兩家緊靠在一起的布店門口，都貼了五個鮮紅大字：（併命大减價。）前一個太玄渺，令人不信：後一個殺氣重重，使人害怕，非但不敢進去（參觀參觀），還得退避三舍。倒不如使一下（赤裸裸大减價）或（購滿貨洋一元奉贈美人一個，）來得動人心絃，收效多多。　　影院借肉　，香艶的跳舞來號召觀衆，雖是怎樣花樣翻新，怎樣費力，而觀衆的熱度並不因之激盪而高，反覺得討厭。考其原因，不是不澈底所致。倘然，去備幾千套肉感消魂的照片來贈送觀衆，我信其營業必蒸蒸日上，有一日千里之勢。謂余不信，曷一試之，可也。　　姊妹花一片在新光大戲院公映到現在，已是第四十八天，眞是（替中國人挽回不少面子，爲國產影片界揚眉吐氣，）又爲（鐵箱）中裝滿了花花綠綠的鈔票，（這話是他們自己說的）則其功莫大矣。我希望再有一部姊妹花續集出現，並且續而三，三而四，四而五，直至十七八集，拍他一個痛快，映他一個痛快。　　墨乾了，不高興再磨，拉瓜就此暫停吧。大家不好  甘地　　何三因爲和徐　先生是親戚關係，他寫的字總能滿滿地加上紅圈，而且懶起起來，請徐四代寫說也奇怪，徐四的字寫在何三的簿子上，往往較自己的天差地遠，自然先生是祗認識何三而認識何三的字的緣故。後來換了個先生，他說徐四的字寫很很好，徐四的朋友阿清馬上告訴新先生，說從前何三的字都是徐四代寫的。何三當然不肯承認，他還聲明自己的字和何四不同的所在。於是有個何四的知己朋友韓五站出來證明什麽時候，什麽時候，那一頁，那一頁，何三的字確是徐四代寫的，徐四鑡有人帮忙，也不怕難爲情的說，我替何三代寫了多少字，都是寫很很好的。何三見無可抵賴，也老着面皮說，字確有徐四代寫的，不過我都改過，不然没有這樣好。先生搖着頭說，我弄不清楚，你們到校長室去。校長聽了他們的話，拍着桌子發怒：（你們大家不好！）墓前  維煥　　爲了生活，抛妻離了母親，在數千里外的上海謀衣食，幾年來的奮鬥，還不能埋葬父親的殯窟，任他在狂風暴雨的浸蝕，我的心像刀割的剌痛。　　（幾年的離别，今天你也該多拜幾下呵！）母親輕微的說着，像無限的悲哀湧塞了胸頭。　　把帶來了的紙錠焚了，我就跪了下去，母親瞧着這樣子，眼涙不能抑制的流了下來；並且還抽噎着。　　（不要這樣的傷心呵，要壞你的身體的，將來我長大了，也得爲你爭口氣。）我急忙安慰着，可是還不能阻止母親的折鬱。　　我們走過了橋，也走了許多金黄的油菜田，在幽長的歸途中，母親終於不說半句話。　　到了家裏，母親頭拷在桌上，眼眶還滿聚着晶謍的熱涙。　　（母親，你爲什麽還要哭啦，）　　（不，我是走得太疲乏了。）　　這時，我感着剛才的一番情景，眼涙也不自主的淌了下來。我知道母親這時心裏的難忍，我幽幽地倍着母親旁邊，想不出半句話來安慰她。自我職業介紹　　江秉志君，浙江鄞縣人，年三十五歲，滬江大學畢業，歷任寗波民强中學英文科主任，定海中學商科主任兼英文敎員，上海惠靈中學建國中學敎員，現願任中學及家庭英文敎員，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。　　陳可新女士，蘇籍，年二十四，大學一程度，歷任初中高小，及家庭敎師多年，現願就上述職務，薪水三十元上下，備有舖保。通訊處，薩坡賽路慈壽里七號三層樓。　　姚君，年二十一，卒業商業專校，通中英文，能打字，熟習簿記，現願任機關商店職員，簿記員，或洋行銀行練習生，具有殷實舖保，薪金不計，通訊處北四川路新祥里二十九號陳甫君轉。　　陳月秀女士，寗波籍，年十六歲，高小程度，願在公司商店或機關醫院等處謀一練習生之職，薪金不計，如有需要者請函北浙江路海寗路南林里第八弄第四家七十七號轉。　　潘金發君，本地人，年十九歲，高小程度，今願就公司洋行商店及機關工廠等練習生，備有殷實舖保，通訊處北浙江路海寗路南林里第八弄第四家七十七號。　　郁君，年二十八歲，海門人，曾任公司醫院茶役等職，現願任公司工廠出店，公館茶役等職，須供膳宿，月薪十五元，如合意者，請函西藏路文元里四號振寰君轉。　　芳君，安微人，年二十九歲，中等程度，能操滬語，曾充機關書記司書等職，現願就公司報館律師事務所職員校對抄寫等職，通訊處法租界辣斐德路慈安里三十一號鞠君收。　　李女士，北平籍，年二十一歲，護士學校畢業，願爲人行各種注射手術，每日隔日均可，酬勞不計，通訊處法租界辣斐德路一三○一號三樓亭子間韓君轉。　　莞蓮女士，上海人，年二十一，中學程度，歷任小學級任及家庭敎師等職，今願任以上或其他等職，外埠也可，通訊處愛而考克路逢源里十八號吳女士轉。　　伍君，大學肄業，廣東人，二十五歲，能操國語，現願任公司洋行職員或家庭敎師，薪水三十元左右，通訊處上海中山路李家庫十七號。　　徐定可君，江蘇人，現年二十六歲，工楷書，現願在本埠擔任義務職，需供膳宿，不需薪金，並有保證，如有機關或家庭欲聘爲文書及學校欲聘爲敎員者，請函金神父路四百四十一號發記店轉。　　某君，年三十二歲，北平私立崇德中學畢業，擅長大小楷及行書，願就機關書記或公司記賬員報館校對之職，月薪不計，通訊處福建福清縣上連巷上號林壽榕收。　　程雪心君，贛籍，大學肄業，歷任學校敎員及黨務工作，能操平語及滬語，擅長戲劇藝術，今願任話劇電影演員及公司洋行機關職員學校家庭敎師等職，薪水不計，合意者請投函法大馬路四七一號四樓程宅。小說暹羅漫譚（二）  亦敏　　（二）史略　　暹羅是在我國的南部，雖然他只有二十萬方哩的領土，還不到我國二十分之一的面積，可是事實昭示我們，他是一個東方新興的獨立國家。固然，暹羅之所以能够獨立，因爲他是處於安南與緬甸之間，英法兩大强國要藉他做一個緩衝，他才能維持這個局面。不過，從前列强和暹國訂立的許多不平等條約，現在居然能够廢除，暹人確也用過了不少的力氣。所以，我首先要說的，就是他們這種堅若卓絕的奮鬥精神，實在是值得我們表示相當敬意的！　　當十八世紀的中葉，是暹國的多事之秋。有一次，竟被緬軍攻進了京都。那時候、有一位僑暹的中國人鄭昭（他是廣東澄海縣人），他爲義憤所激練了兩千國兵，把緬軍驅出了境外。事後，暹人因爲感激鄭昭的恩德，就擁他做了國王。這是公元一千七百六十八年的事。　　鄭昭的女婿，是一個暹人。名呌通暖。在表面土，他對於鄭昭非常恭順，而且也有過許多汗馬功勞。可是他的存心，却非常毒辣。結果，於一千七百八十二年鄭昭終於被他篡奪了。這就是暹國今朝（嗎哈年基　土族的篇一世　。白　　現在的　　　第七世了　本　　　　　　　　　　　　　一百五十二年的歷史。</p>

<p>電影專刊米曲羅用了反激計嘉寳不得不棄家返美（下）  廣道　　他們亦很秘密地在鏡頭上試騐着她。結果之佳，使他們暗暗驚歎不置。那時葛雷泰嘉寳還在瑞典的鄉間隠居着，絲毫没有重返美國的表示，所以那位凱絲琳塞加伐亦就穏穏地，要坐在嘉寳的寶座上去了。但是當塞加伐受鏡頭試騐的時候，有一位在場的嘉寳的親信。他領會到了當時的特殊形勢。所以他在事後，就將塞加伐的相片，加了一封很詳細的信，用近代交通最敏捷的方法，寄到瑞典給嘉寳看去。其結果，就是嘉寳的立卽决定回美，以及進行交涉拍攝（凱塞琳女皇）的合同。　　等到嘉賽决定了回好萊塢，米曲羅對於這位塞加伐的興趣，亦立卽低落了。這位不幸的俄國歌女，雖然有嘉寳的容貌舉止，但是眞假之分，終是不能泯滅，而價值的高低，亦就無法彌補。結果，她在好萊塢閒住着一年之久，没有奉召到攝影場去過一趙。她合同是有的，薪水是照發的，但是她一天到晚無所事事，祗可以天天游水，日日打球，度着她安閑無聊的歲月，等到一年合同期滿，她亦就被解約了。但是這位俄國的歌女，凱絲琳塞加伐，却是曾被利用了去反激嘉寳，使决定重返好萊塢的人！事敗垂成，凱絲琳心中的懊喪，亦可想而知矣。　　本來塞加伐是一個失意之人，而失意之人，往往又是很容易像李廣之屢奇，而永久不得志的，而塞加伐倒還好，他還能失之東隅，收之桑榆，不至於潦倒終身。因爲這個時候，華納兄弟正在訪尋新人材，她就被華納公司羅致了去。他先在Ｂedside一片裏，小試身手。結果是成功的。她現在正預備拍一張Ｂritish　Agent那就是她正式與觀衆的見禮。那張片子的脚本，已經交給她去研習去了。　　講到這位凱絲琳塞加伐的過去歷史，我們亦無妨在這裏附帶的約略提一下。她是生在俄國的舊都聖彼得堡的，現在那舊都的名字，已改爲列塞格拉得了。她的家庭，是個藝術的家庭，她父親是個藝術家。她家道本來是很富足的，不過自從俄國發生了革命，他們全家就離開了聖彼得堡，南遷到黑海邊上一個小地方，因爲那裏白軍尚保存了一部份殘餘的勢力。他們在那裏住了三年之久，生活照舊的還是很順當，她父親從煤油礦方面的收入，是很可觀的。不幸後來白軍又被紅軍征服，於是他們再向别處逃亡，經過了提茀利斯和君士但丁等地，度過了三年艱難困苦的歲月，後來終究到了巴黎。並且因爲家道已不如前，所以她自己就决定了學習歌舞。她第一次的登台在一九二六年。她在舞台上有相當的地位；她並没有想到上銀幕，直到米曲羅公司將她延聘了去。（完）影片談評評一箭二鵰  巽之　　　　	Ｓhould　Ladies　Behave　　丨國泰丨　　據說，可以造成戲劇的題材，一共祇有三十六種境遇，這三十六種境遇之中，（誤解）也是一種，當然，以這種境遇爲主題的戲劇，他在藝術上的價值，一定不及其他境遇那樣嚴重，所以，這一種境遇最多適用的便是喜劇。這一點，在中外戲劇上的例證很多！可以不必歷舉。現在這一部（一箭三鵰），就是以（誤解）爲骨幹而展開的作品。　　祇因爲故事的結癥是在一個（誤會），所以結構上有許多牽强附會的地方，三四十歲的中年婦女，總不致於健忘了初戀時代戀人的名字，可不是嗎？一個是畫家，一個是鋼琴家，兩者應該是不會混同的，而且，在故事展開中間，（繪畫）這一事實占了相當重要的地位，在現實，這誤會的揭穿，可以不必等到最後的那一句話的。　　再講其他，故事所要告訴觀衆的，也許是勸導年青女子不要嫁給上年紀的人，這主題實在不是一個嚴肅的問題，不，可以說，這問題是不該這樣提出來的，在現在的社會，對於生活成問題的女人，結婚是一種歸宿，是一種職業，對於生活没有問題而闲得無事的太太，小姐，那麽結婚是一種游戲。在前者，能嫁到一個上年紀的男人還是一個幸福的機會，在後者，年齡可以說是不值得她們考慮的問題。在（一箭三鵰）裏面，看模樣是屬於後者的，那麽這說敎不是没有必要了嗎？　　里昻，巴里摩亞依舊是很成功的，尤其是在那一塲規勸女兒的戲，（我祗希望你的幸福，爲着你的幸福，什麽事情都要給你做的），假使，這部戲有一點嚴肅性的話，嚴肅性就在這一段戲上。母女二角，都能稱職，祇是扮畫家的，却不够倜儻。導演限於劇情，没有特别可稱　的地方。愛看輕鬆的戲劇，而又懂得對話者，不妨一看。觀衆意見烈熖觀後  丁玎　　（烈焰）的劇作者寫到農村婦女的如何貪慕虚榮和物質的享受，可是他没有緊把住這一點而作有力的描寫，他讓許多不重要的故事掩蔽了，没有深刻的刺激。　　攝影的成績很好，的確有幾幕十分美麗的鏡頭。不過有幾處很可以看出，剪接的時候，因爲要保留這幾個美麗的畫面，硬把它插在裏面，以致弄巧成拙，反不免有些上下不相吻合。　在故事中，徐茜茜究竟是何公度的什麽人，没有交代清楚，如果是他的妻子的話，那麽在何公度和阿貞發生關係之後，爲什麽畫面上就始終找不到她的影兒呢？至於所謂滬北的大火災，在畫面上也没有忠實的暴露，除了小小的火光和一些從地上發出的烟外。隔岸觀火一幕雖然是導演的諷剌的描繪，可是事實上在一個推窗可望的地方失了火，那般舞興正濃的人們，除了從窗口遥望以外，肯不肯全都奔去看看，還是一個問題呢！　　演員中以飾阿貞的胡萍表演最好，飾何公度的浦曦次之，其餘平平，無甚特色。評（烈熖）  克洛　　很明顯的，這部片子本來有牠的中心意識，可是因爲客觀環境所限制，使牠不得不含混其辭，以求達其開映的目的，於是令人看過後，就不免有點（隔靴搔癢）之感，。　　然而，那些對比的塲面，却能激動觀衆的情緒，而令人得到深刻的印象。如“　　一一方面在田地裏忙忙碌碌的工作着，曬着烈，一方面却很安適的坐在凉房底下，開風扇，喝汽水。　　一方面草屋着火了，貧民只好用木桶和臉盆取水救火：一方面洋樓着火了，却有科學化的救火機。　　一方面草屋被毁，貧民便無安身之處，一方面洋樓被毁，却可以領到大批的保險金，重新建築了更輝煌的洋樓。　　攝影的清晰，幽美，鏡頭的週轉靈活，是這部片子最成功的部分。　　演員表演得却不大出色，彭飛與胡萍的表情有點勉强和做作，飾反派角色之浦曦，倒很能表達出他的特性。爲名爲利  福　　棄四妻而不惜　　和葛莉泰嘉寳合演（克利斯丁娜）的男主角，約翰吉爾勃。是銀幕上最羅曼的克的一個人。他在影戲裏扮演愛情的熱烈，已顚倒了千萬的女子，使她們願作他的妻。但是在他的私生活裏，他却娶了四個妻子，到了一個都留不住。當然，他的四個妻子，都是很有名氣的美婦人。第一個是奥莉薇亞波蕙爾（Ｏlivia　Butwell）她比較名氣小些，所以好萊塢對於她的底細，不大清楚。第二個是李德莉絲喬伊（Ｌeatrice　Ｊoy）她曾經是位銀幕上的明星，當時亦是最美麗的一個。第三個是殷娜克萊爾。（ＬnaClaire）他在舞台上和銀幕上，都有同等盛大的聲名·第四個就是現在的佛金尼亞勃魯絲（Ｖirginia　Ｂruce）。他本是位影星，不過她爲愛約翰吉爾勃，而竟肯犧牲自己的事業去嫁他爲婦。不過在最近，她已决定和約翰離婚。這件事驚動了好萊塢。有位好事之徒，因爲要知道約翰家庭的失敗，到底是什麽原因，就去向三個已離的妻訪問了一下。據他第二個妻李德莉絲喬伊說：（他好喝酒，脾氣亦不好。）他第三個妻（說：他的事業，就是他思想的全部，以致不能顧到家室的快樂。）第四個佛金尼亞勃魯絲說：（我想約翰是男子中最聰明，最敏捷的一個人。他是一個再好没有的伴侣。他亦富有學問。如果要我說出他一定有什麽毛病，我恐怕他是他自己野心的犧牲者。他的工作，就是他的夫人，以致他没有心思，用在别的方面。）卜萬蒼赴杭　　（黄金時代）一片，女主角係殷明珠，男主角係金燄，這片是卜萬蒼進藝華公司第一個大砲，所以老卜處處地方，都十分愼重，内景開拍，已有多日，上星期六，卜萬蒼偕同攝影師周克，佈景師方沛霖等多人起程赴杭州拍取（黄金時代）外景。電影小說喀羅蘭那（Ｃarolina）（十）（一）  文印　　吉拉婷聲色俱厲地說道：（我的母親不要見你！）瓊娜亦發怒道：（哦，原來你們是這樣的。我向來對於這家人家是崇拜得什麽似的，以爲它充滿了喜悅光榮！······原來是充滿了仇恨狠毒！全是一班鄙薄的人！······）吉拉婷道：（請你去吧！）瓊娜反身要走的時候，外面的門開了！威爾從查爾士頓回來了。他站在門内，看着大家都是怒容滿面的，就問道：（你們在？做什麽？）瓊娜看着他，愁苦滿面地說道：（你的母親呌我離開這裏呢。）威爾道“（什麽？······這裏面一定有些誤會······）康納萊夫人走了進來，她冷冷地道：（有什麽誤會？）威爾怒容勃然地對着他母親道：（這太没有道理了！簡捷太豈有此理了！）吉搠婷插嘴道：（威爾，你怎麽啦，這樣和母親講話嗎？我眞覺得有些詫異了······）威爾苦笑着對吉拉婷道：（吉拉婷，請你少管些閒事吧！你多管閒事，恐怕還有比這個呌你詫異的事情哩！）他說完了，又對着他母親道：（母親，你一定要重新考慮一下子······）他的母親不等他說完就說道：（難道）你要潦倒一生，瘋瘋癲癲的，一個錢没有，像你的叔叔羅伯那樣可憐嗎？）威爾道：（這是什麽話？羅伯叔叔和這件事有什麽關係呢？）羅伯插嘴道：（因爲我沉溺在愛情裏了，威爾。那時，我好像巴比倫的王，而她呢，好像一個基督敎的女奴！地方就在這裏······這所房子裏······娶了那種女人，是要辱没康納萊的門楣的······威爾，你說好笑不好笑？······）康納萊夫人想阻止他，但是羅伯滔滔不絕地說道：（但是葩白拉格蘭德却不相信門楣不門楣的話······她是深深愛我的！）　　瓊娜抽了一口氣道：（誰？）她瞪着眼睛望着他。但是羅伯没有理會她。他繼續着說道：（就是在這個房間裏，我第一次遇見了她·······紅黑色的頭髮，像你的一樣······）他指着瓊娜的頭。瓊娜還抽着氣，馨音極低微地說道：（葩白拉格蘭德就是我的祖母。）康納萊裝作不屑的神氣說道：葩白拉格蘭德是吉拉婷的看護。她因爲和羅伯發生了戀愛，所以······）瓊娜大聲說道：（你說的不是實話。他愛的那個人，早已死在南北戰爭中了·······）康納萊還是很神氣的道：（那是我告訴她的話。因爲要避免不名譽事件的發生，所以不能不打發她走呀。）威爾張着大嘴，不相信似的問他母親道：（你告訴她，說叔叔死在戰塲上的嗎？）康納萊夫人說了一聲（是的·······）大家就寂靜無聲了。一回兒羅伯的神氣突然變了。他好像縮下去了一截。他自言自語道：（我還要去檢閱軍隊哩。今天晚上就要開拔到前線去哩。）他還唱着軍歌，從墻壁上取一支古舊的槍掮在肩上，大踏步地走到大廳裏，又從大廳裏走到花園裏去了。他的聲音在空中飄忽地傳過來：（四人一行向右轉······開步······丨）（未完）</p>

<p>Jin-Sui Army Zhao and Fu Divisions Demobilize</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram: For days, unarmed soldiers of Sun's army have been transported back from Sansheng Palace. They are hungry, exhausted, and almost inhuman, especially the wounded, who are in great pain. The Jin-Sui army has applied medicine to them. The remnants of Sun's troops have been reorganized into three brigades, and the designations have been telegraphed by Fu to the Military Branch Council for approval.

Once there is some order, they will be transferred to Hebei for training. Yu came to visit Fu at noon on the second day to discuss everything. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun's troops were completely disarmed by the Jin army, the unarmed soldiers are being counted and will be reorganized soon.

Zhao Chengzhou and Fu Zuoyi's two divisions will also demobilize to Baotou within days. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ningxia Second Day Telegram: More than 1,000 remnants of Sun's army, who resisted reorganization, have fled to the Dingyuanying area of Alashan Banner, looting, burning, and killing terribly. After the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the Ning army rushed to suppress them, they are now fleeing towards the Chahar Hatarling area. At the same time, Sun's fierce bandit Zheng Sicheng suddenly led his troops to occupy Mengcheng Fort, Huian Fort, and Huamachi in Hedong, causing unbearable disturbances. Ma Yuhua's regiment has been ordered to suppress them. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ningxia First Day Telegram: Sun, in his previous act of defiance, arbitrarily appointed the fierce bandit Zheng Sicheng from northern Shaanxi as the commander of the Ningdong Garrison, and issued opium, heroin, guns, and bullets, recruiting bandits on the border of Ningxia and Shaanxi as internal support, and falsely claiming to be a special envoy of the Central Party Department, inciting the stationed troops, plotting to disrupt the rear. Ma Hongbin's troops sent teams to suppress them severely, and a small number of remnants fled towards Gansu, Guyuan, and Huanxian. Recently, they have been causing disturbances in the Huian Fort area of Hedong in Ningxia. Ma Hongkui has ordered the stationed troops to pursue and suppress them, and it will not be difficult to quell them soon. After Sun's army was defeated and routed by our heavy blows, there are still over 1,000 remnants, who have recently been causing disturbances near Dingyuanying in Alashan Banner. Ma Kui's regiment has been sent to pursue and suppress them. On the afternoon of the 31st, they engaged the bandits at Sanshi River in a fierce battle until night, killing over 80 enemies and capturing over 100. The bandits could not hold out and fled north. The pursuit is underway. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Bufang telegraphed Jing to report victory, saying that he had killed Guo Shuanzi, a long-time bandit in Ningxia, and seized over 900 steel cannons. (Second Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In addition to reorganizing Sun's troops into three brigades, the rest are being dismissed. Those with guns are given five yuan each, and those without guns are given two yuan each. Because Sun is impoverished, he sent his jade watermelon to Tianjin, wanting to sell it for 300,000 yuan, which is still under negotiation. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Army in Northeast:</p>
<p>Main Force Concentrated in Western Jehol</p>
<p>Most of the Puppet Jing'an Army Will Be Sent to Jehol</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from outside the pass say that the Japanese 10th and 14th Divisions have returned to their country. The Wakayama 3rd Division and the Butomo 16th Division have been transferred to northern Manchuria. After the Sugihara 7th Division is stationed in Jehol, its headquarters will be moved to Duolun, and the main force will be concentrated in western Jehol. In order to unify the police organization in Manchuria, the Japanese will have the commander of the military police replace the police chief. Ooba, the chief of the police bureau of the Kwantung Government, will serve as a senior advisor. The Japanese and puppet troops have seized more than 300,000 miscellaneous civilian guns in various villages, and 160,000 have also been seized in Liaoning Province. Those that are usable have been sent to the Liaoning and Jilin Special Service Agencies for storage, and those that are unusable, such as miscellaneous guns and local cannons, have been transported to the Liaoning Ordnance Factory for smelting and remanufacturing. The puppet Jing'an Army plans to expand in April and send most of its troops to Jehol. The puppet Manchurian Ministry of the Army has now divided the country into seven military districts. The candidates for the military district commanders are: Zhang Jinghui or Xing Shilian for the capital district, Yu Chengzhen for the Harbin district, Ji Xing for the Jilin district, Yu Zhishan for the Fengtian district, Zhang Haipeng for the Jehol district, Zhang Wentao for the Heilongjiang district, and Batu Lama Bula for the Xing'an district. Li Shouxin has now been commissioned by a certain party as the commander of the Chahar East Garrison. His troops consist of about 8,000 infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers.

<p>Japanese Arbitrarily Establish Postal Delivery: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests to Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese arbitrarily established postal delivery in Beiping. After our country's post office negotiated with them on the basis of reason, they agreed to stop delivering. Recently, the Japanese Tourist Bureau has still been arbitrarily sending mail. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese ambassador. (Second Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because the Ministry of Communications learned that the Japanese Tourist Bureau in Beiping was privately transporting mail to the Northeast, it suspected that the Japanese Tourist Bureau in Tianjin might also be doing so. It ordered the Hebei Postal Administration to investigate. The administration has confirmed that private transportation is indeed occurring. The method is the same as that of the Beiping bureau: the senders affix sufficient Japanese puppet stamps, pack the mail, and ship it to Qinhuangdao, then transfer it to Yuguan, and then have it delivered by the puppet post office. The Hebei Postal Administration sent personnel to negotiate with Kurihara, the Japanese consul in Tianjin, several times. The Japanese consul prevaricated and did not give a definite reply. The Postal Administration telegraphed back to the Ministry of Communications, requesting direct negotiation. (Second Day)</p>

<p>Japanese and Puppets Reinforce Troops to Protect</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Malanyu say that there is a battalion of puppet troops stationed in Malanyu, which is the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the 4th Brigade of the Jehol Provincial Garrison Division. The puppet battalion commander is Song Jiren, who used to be in the Righteous Army. There is a squadron of Japanese troops stationed in Malanyu. Recently, 51 more have been added, with 42 trucks. The newly arrived Japanese soldiers often go to the countryside to survey maps, investigate water wells, and test water quality, with unclear intentions. Since the Eastern Tombs have been guarded by puppet troops, theft cases have continued unabated, and treasures have been almost completely stolen. According to the newly added Japanese soldiers, Puyi has decided to come from the puppet capital to sweep the tomb on the Qingming Festival according to the old lunar calendar, so they have come specifically to arrange protection.

<p>Ma Ze Zhao Prepared a Complete Account of the Kang-Tibet Dispute</p>
<p>Presented to Chiang Requesting Swift Remediation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Ze Zhao, the director of the representative office in Nanjing of the people of Xikang, believes that the Tibetan army's invasion of Kang this time, hoping to occupy the six counties of Shiqu, Dengke, Dege, Baiyu, Danhua, and Ganzi in the northeastern part of Xikang, is quite noteworthy. He has prepared a complete account of the Kang-Tibet dispute, telegraphed it to Chairman Chiang, and stated the course of the Kang-Tibet dispute, from the time Tibet sent an ultimatum to the magistrate of Dege County until the recent attack on Xikang by the Tibetan army in the north and south, and attached a map of the Kang-Tibet war and a plan to solve the Kang-Tibet dispute, both short-term and long-term, asking Chiang to review it and forward it to the Central Government for swift remediation. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang replied to the telegram from the representative of the people of Xikang in Nanjing, saying, "The Tibetans have broken their promise and recklessly resorted to arms. When the alarming news came, I was filled with indignation. Sichuan and Xikang are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and their interests are shared. Moreover, the relationship to national defense is especially important, and we should find ways to support them and eliminate these stubborn bandits. When necessary, we will do our best to assist and strengthen national defense." (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tibetan Delegation Leaves India by Ship Today</p>
<p>The Kalakhaite... A delegation sent by the Tibetan government to China to welcome the Panchen Lama back to Tibet is scheduled to depart for Shanghai tomorrow on the Gucang ship. The delegation consists of 50 Tibetan monks, carrying a variety of valuable gifts. They arrived in Kalimpong on Friday from Lhasa. According to Tibetan sources, the Lhasa Council telegraphed the Tibetan government representative in Kalimpong, saying that someone was planning to harm the current regent and instructed the delegation to go to China by sea to avoid delays and to accompany the Panchen back to Tibet as soon as possible. Observers generally believe that if the Panchen, who has been living abroad for more than a decade due to disagreements with the Dalai Lama, is allowed to return to Tibet, there will be a trend of cooperation between the Chinese and Tibetan governments.

<p>Gu's Division in Southern Juxian Intercepts Large Group of Liu's Bandits</p>
<p>Bandits Heavily Struck and Fled South in Panic</p>
<p>Suppression of Liu's Military Affairs Comes to an End</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 3:00 AM this morning, Liu's bandits were resting near Dadian, 50 li south of Juxian County, when they were suddenly attacked by the Lin Binghai Regiment of Gu Liangmin's Division, which arrived by car. Over 200 bandits were killed, over 200 guns and over a dozen machine guns were seized. The bandits' elite forces were almost completely lost, and they fled south in panic. In the afternoon, they arrived at Pingshang Town, at the junction of Juxian, Rizhao, and Ganyu counties. Han Linglin's regiment, Ma Guan's and Zhang Shulin's two brigades, and the cavalry regiment followed in pursuit. The remaining troops all returned to their original defenses. The suppression of Liu's military affairs has come to an end. The seized donkeys and horses were all sent to the local people, and the hostages were handed over to the district chief.

<p>Eastern Route Army Approaches Changting</p>
<p>Peng's Bandits Still Trying to Struggle</p>
<p>Chiang Ting-wen Arrives in Xiamen</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Kou Kou two divisions crossed Xinquan and Da Xiaochi, approaching Changting. Peng Dehuai's bandits are now retreating from northern Fujian to Tinglian, still trying to struggle. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Chiang Ting-wen arrived in Xiamen on the first day. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The military is resting. The military affairs of suppressing bandits in northern and western Fujian are currently not progressing because the relevant highways in each section have not been opened, and the rear supply is difficult. Most of the divisions of the 4th Column in western Fujian are still stationed in the Longyan and Longmen areas, and the vanguard is not far from Da Xiaochi Liancheng. Because the Communist bandits in eastern and western Jiangxi are both under pressure, and the contact line on the southeast route has been cut off, the main forces are not under unified command, the front line is therefore in a state of dormancy. Chiang Ting-wen did not think it necessary to go to Longyan because the front line was not in a tense situation, so he came to Xiamen on the first day and will go to Zhangzhou to sit in town within days. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A military officer from Nanchang who came to Nanjing said that the remaining bandits in Jiangxi Province as a whole have been declining in strength since they were suppressed, with no more than 70,000 to 80,000 people and less than 50,000 guns. The people in the bandit areas have surrendered one after another, and many of those who blindly followed the bandits have also surrendered. The suppression of bandits in Jiangxi is coming soon.

<p>Expanded Memorial Week at the Headquarters</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>Regarding National Salvation Education</p>
<p>(Nanchang) On the morning of the 2nd, Chairman Chiang summoned more than 1,000 people, including northwest generals, chief camp officers from all sectors of the Party, government, education in Nanchang, and staff members of the headquarters, to hold an expanded memorial week at the headquarters. After the ceremony, Chiang first reported that Sun Dianying had been completely resolved last week, which was a blessing for the northwest and also eliminated a future trouble for the entire country of China. Repeated rebellions are suppressed as soon as they cause chaos, and the Red bandits are also collapsing, which proves that China is becoming more unified and prosperous. This is all due to the efforts of our civil and military comrades. Then, he addressed all sectors, stating that the most important thing in current politics is education. All politics and military affairs can only be effective and powerful with the progress of education. If students are not good, it is the teacher's fault. If educators fulfill their responsibilities, there will be no people who cannot be educated. He also wants to establish the foundation and model of national salvation education, and oppose the national subjugation school style after the May Fourth Movement. Only by following the Prime Minister's legacy of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace, which is to say, propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, should we especially pay attention to production education, in order to save the school style and cultivate talents who can save the country and the people. The citizens and students of Nanchang are now more advanced than before, and it is rare to see bad habits such as spitting everywhere and not buttoning buttons. I am very pleased, but there are still many shortcomings. Now I am instructing all the responsible officials that if any students or staff members' clothing or behavior does not conform to the six principles of the New Life Movement, the responsible officials should be held accountable and punished. I order all civil and military institutions that those who do not learn military salutes are not allowed to wear military caps or military uniforms. We should also pay close attention to this. Nanchang is the birthplace of the New Life Movement, and it must first become a clean land in China. (Second Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory Resumes Work</p>
<p>The Factory Accepts the Workers' Conditions</p>
<p>Workers Surrounded the Commissioner's Office the Day Before Until Midnight Before Dispersing</p>
<p>Coal Mine Strike Still Under Mediation</p>
<p>(Tianjin) All workers of the Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory resumed work at 4:00 PM today. The factory is rushing to pay wages for the strike period. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 2,000 workers from the Kailuan Tangshan Mine and the Huaxin Yarn Factory gathered at the Jingzhou Hotel at 2:00 PM on the 1st, set off on a parade, passed through Guangdong Street, West Malu Station Road, and finally arrived at the Luan Yu District Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office to petition Tao Shangming. The workers of the Huaxin Yarn Factory put forward five conditions. Tao consulted with Zhou Shutao, the manager of the factory, and decided to accept them one by one. The workers were scheduled to resume work on the morning of the 2nd. At that time, the conditions were established and they dispersed. However, the workers of the Tang Mine did not leave because there was no result, and they still surrounded the Commissioner's Office at night, demanding that they answer the conditions previously proposed. The workers' meals were delivered by the contract workers. The traffic on the station road was cut off, and the police were on high alert. Tao Shangming contacted the Tianjin Kailuan Mining Bureau by telephone in the middle of the night, but because the bureau had no definite plan and did not want to commit to the workers' conditions, it was temporarily at a loss. The workers declared that if they could not win, they would carry out some plan. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Contents of the conditions for the resolution of the Huaxin labor strike on the 1st: (1) Abolish the old labor union, (2) The factory must treat workers in accordance with the first phase of the contract, (3) The food expenses issued by the factory last year due to the automatic suspension of work due to the war must be equal to the number of employees, (4) The wages previously reduced by the factory must be restored, (5) The factory will issue wages in full from the day of the strike. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 2nd, the Hebei Department of Industry received a telegram from Tao Shangming, stating that the thousand striking workers of the Tangshan Mine who surrounded the Commissioner's Office had been earnestly persuaded and had dispersed at about 1:00 AM on the 2nd. The solutions to the conditions proposed by the workers are being discussed with the Mining Bureau, and he is reporting this first, etc. On the 2nd, it was heard that the British general manager of the Luan Mining Bureau and the Tianjin Mining Bureau did not conduct a specific study of the conditions proposed by the striking workers of the Tangshan Mine due to the holidays. (Second Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to an investigation, someone in Tangshan labor strike said that there were indeed Communist elements instigating the Tangshan labor strike at the beginning. After being discovered by the workers, they were reported and expelled. The labor strike there was about to come to an end, but recently the labor strike there has expanded again, and there is a tendency to contact the Kailuan mine workers to act in unison. According to accurate investigation, it is actually related to a certain party. That party is using traitors to mix into the workers' side and carry out large-scale incitement, in order to make the Tangshan Kailuan mines shake or collapse due to the labor strike, so as to collude with the traitors and buy them in their name. In this way, all mining rights in Hebei can be fully controlled, and the power of both the British and Chinese will be completely destroyed. (Second Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan labor strike is becoming more serious today. The Huaxin Yarn Factory went on strike, and about a thousand factory workers and Kailuan mine workers surrounded the Luandong Administrative Office and made demands, dispersing only in the evening. The yarn factory workers have joined the new labor union organized by Zhao Dazhong and others. It is heard that Zhao and others are inclined to (Manchukuo). (Second Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Japan's Diplomatic Mobilization 舒·</h3>
<p>Japan's diplomacy toward the United States, having seemingly managed to recover from its deadlock, is now launching a full-scale diplomatic mobilization. First, the Foreign Minister telegraphed Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, ordering him to return to Japan for confidential instructions. Ambassador to the United States, Hiroshi Saitō, will also follow Ariyoshi. Ambassador to France, Haruo Satō, will also return shortly. Other ambassadors and consuls general will be allowed to return to Japan for instructions if necessary. Superficial observation of this situation suggests it carries significant weight. The international relations surrounding Japan are becoming increasingly tense. Countries are gradually focusing on strengthening their real power to prepare for any future contingencies. Take England, for example: its Far Eastern diplomacy was centered on cooperation with Japan, and this was the case with Russia, and its relations with China also had similar tendencies. However, since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), Japan's political relations in the Far East and the issue of cotton textile markets have shown it standing in opposition to the British Empire. Not only has the British market in China been fundamentally shaken, but there is also great concern that India, Southeast Asia, and even South Africa are being invaded by Japan. Therefore, England is rapidly building the Singapore naval base and actively reclaiming its cotton textile market.</p>
<p>U.S.-Japan diplomacy has recently shown signs of improvement due to the exchange of diplomatic notes between Hull and Saitō and the approval of Philippine independence. However, the United States continues to build massive warships according to its planned schedule. The gloomy clouds over the Pacific can only be temporarily cleared through diplomatic maneuvering, but the political opposition cannot be resolved or balanced with mere words. However, because of the great distance between the United States and Japan and because their economic interests have not yet reached a state of intense sharpness, a temporary relaxation can still be勉圖 attempted to prevent immediate deterioration.</p>
<p>In Japan's diplomatic relations, the most urgent and dangerous situation is undoubtedly its confrontation with the Soviet Union. After the Japanese army occupied Northern Manchuria, the area along the Heilongjiang (Amur River) up to the Ussuri River and Lake Khanka is riddled with fuses, with the potential for unexpected explosions anytime, anywhere. Moreover, the fundamental political ideologies of Japan and the Soviet Union are completely incompatible. Japan, under the pretext of strictly preventing communism, uses military force to defend itself everywhere. The Soviet Union, to guard against Japanese aggression, is also turning its machinery to the enrichment of military preparedness. Furthermore, the Chinese Eastern Railway issue obstructs their relationship, and disputes over North Sea fisheries arise from time to time. Although the Soviet Union is unwilling to provoke a challenge and Japan does not dare to initiate hostilities lightly, there is ultimately no way to eliminate the future crisis. Therefore, Japan-Soviet relations are in reality an incurable cancer in Far Eastern international politics.</p>
<p>Japanese militarists are well aware of this point. Therefore, their first priority is to exert all their efforts to break out of international diplomatic isolation. The initial step in their preparation is to start with England. The old friendship between England and Japan and the common interests in regard to the Soviet Union are not entirely unrelated. Therefore, there is much potential for political cooperation. However, Japan will not easily abandon its economic gains. The cotton industry has deeply penetrated British colonies and dominions, and would England readily concede? Moreover, England has long been known as a utilitarian country. How can its diplomacy toward Japan be anything but consistent with that? Since Anglo-Japanese relations cannot improve easily, the Japanese must seek a way out in the Pacific. First, they seek understanding with the United States. If this initial step is successful, they can further discuss naval ratios, extend the Washington Treaty, or establish a new agreement, so that U.S.-Japan relations in the Pacific will not deteriorate again. This would provide Japan with an additional layer of security against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Japanese militarism, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations can be seen as a victory. However, from a diplomatic standpoint, it cannot be considered anything other than a major failure. Initially, the Japanese militarists thought that all problems could be solved with machine guns and artillery. Later, they realized the absurdity of this idea. Looking around at the complex international relations of Europe and throughout the world, they saw anti-Japanese sentiment everywhere, and the situation was unfavorable to Japan. Therefore, they urgently want to improve their international diplomacy in Europe and have ordered Satō to return to Japan to devise countermeasures. If Japan can improve its current negative trends with European and American countries to a certain extent and also transform its relations with China, then a so-called new diplomatic policy may be established. However, it is feared that there may not be a skillful and satisfactory means of dealing with the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Whether Gu Will Appear in Court Is Undecided</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Wuxi court's subpoena to Gu Renfa has been delivered to the provincial government and forwarded to the Department of Civil Affairs. Gu visited Chairman Chen to discuss the Li case and promised to handle it according to law. Whether Gu will appear in court is undecided. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Supervisor Tian Jiongjin said that the supervisor sent by this court to Wuxi to investigate the Gu case had departed a week ago and would return to Nanjing in two or three days. After the investigation report is returned to the court, it will be used to decide whether to impeach Gu. According to reports, two points are noteworthy: (1) Li Shuyun's forging of official seals or stealing and using official seals cannot be unrelated to Director Gu; (2) Li Shuyun, Gu's wife, instigated the Liu sub-bureau chief to refuse to hand over the case, indicating Gu's usual indulgence towards Li Shuyun, and Gu cannot shirk his responsibility. As for the issue of bigamy caused by this case, it is not very related to public officials and is a very common matter, which can be resolved by law. According to my personal opinion, this point should not be included in the impeachment. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<p>Hirota's Conciliatory Diplomacy Plans to Sign a Non-Aggression Pact with the United States</p>
<p>Hoping for Non-Aggression for Ten Years</p>
<p>Dreaming of Political and Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>Specific Plan to Be Decided After Saito Hiroshi Returns Home</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since taking office, Foreign Minister Hirota has been working hard to overcome the difficulties of 1935 and is carrying out various diplomatic efforts. Among them, the Foreign Minister's diplomatic work with the United States is particularly noteworthy. The Foreign Minister believes that it is most necessary for Japan and the United States to sign a new agreement to ensure the political security of both countries. He is currently studying the plan with relevant parties and will decide on a specific plan after Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi returns home. According to the Foreign Minister's opinion, to avoid the danger of a breakdown in the disarmament conference, Japan and the United States should first sign a non-aggression treaty, deciding not to engage in war for at least ten years. At the same time, the two countries should actively strengthen their political and economic ties. Foreign Minister Hirota is now most enthusiastic about considering the issue of a Japan-U.S. non-aggression treaty. Therefore, the attitude of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs after Ambassador Saito returns home will be very active. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

In his speech, Ambassador Troyanovsky strongly stated that from the perspective of world peace, the friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States is extremely important. Other speakers enthusiastically supported Ambassador Troyanovsky's statement. (TASS dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Echo de Paris published a lengthy article by its famous reporter Bertina, discussing the United States, Japan, Russia, and the Far East. It stated that the Tokyo government wants to resolve the various discrepancies between Japan and the United States with direct action. As for the ideals of U.S. President Roosevelt and his advisors, they are undoubtedly different from those of Japan. They may think that Japan's national power is too strong and should be resisted. The way to resist is to contact Soviet Russia, help it with money, and give it a certificate of (good conduct) (i.e., recognize Soviet Russia). (Soviet Russia is using this mentality to incite American public opinion to oppose Japan. But what Soviet Russia opposes is not only Japan, but also the Anglo-Saxon race. Japan, in view of Russia's actions, advocates Pan-Asianism to resist. According to those who are good at judging, even if Japan and Russia have an armed conflict, the result will not be able to clearly determine the fate of northern and eastern Asia). Bertina finally raised a question to conclude, saying that from the perspective of American interests and the interests of European countries with territories in Asia, is it appropriate to negotiate a temporary solution that Soviet Russia would not oppose in order to ease people's minds?

<p>Far Eastern Situation Forms a Four-Cornered Struggle</p>
<p>US-Russia Alliance Deeply Feared by Japan</p>
<p>Hirota Cleverly Uses Estrangement Tactics</p>
<p>丨French Press Observation on the Exchange of Notes Between the US and Japan丨</p>
<p>(Paris) (Tsing Yi Pao) published an article by Ruskin discussing the relationship between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's current policies and the United States. It stated that although former Army Minister Araki has resigned and left the political stage, this is only temporary. Araki is known for his eloquence, and now he has been replaced by the taciturn Army Minister Hayashi. This shows that Foreign Minister Hirota has been given full authority by the Emperor and Prime Minister Saito to carry out peaceful policies. Since the Japanese militarists were angered by the attacks in Geneva, they were determined to take a gamble and respond to the intervention of the League of Nations with military action, forcing the countries with the closest interests to recognize (Manchukuo) and Japan's superior position in this (new country). At the same time, Foreign Minister Hirota is confident that he can achieve the same goal through diplomatic means. For this reason, the military has temporarily restrained itself, allowing Hirota to calmly display his diplomatic skills. On the surface, this is the case, but in reality, the military has not abandoned its superior position in Japanese politics. In his speech to the Diet on January 23, Foreign Minister Hirota advocated that Japan should assume the same task in the East as Britain in the West, that is, to demand that Japan have the same naval armaments as Britain and the United States and to control the Far Eastern seas. Later, on February 26, Hirota's letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hull was the second step in Hirota's diplomacy. In this document, he proposed establishing a direct understanding with the United States to resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries, especially the naval issue. In fact, Hirota's goal is not only to seek an understanding with the United States on the naval issue, it is also very clear that the Far Eastern situation is now a four-cornered struggle. Nanjing, Moscow, Washington, and Tokyo each occupy one corner. Japan has nothing to fear from Nanjing. Since the Tanggu Truce Agreement was signed in June 1933, Japan is convinced that a Sino-Japanese understanding will not be difficult to achieve. If Japan can gain the understanding of the United States before 1935, so that the United States will forever abandon military action in the Far East, unless the United States intervenes by force for self-defense, then Japan can concentrate on dealing with Soviet Russia. A Russo-Japanese conflict is likely to break out immediately. Although this statement has been widely spread recently, Japan is also not afraid of Moscow. What Japan fears is the combination of Moscow and Washington's power. Therefore, for the sake of dealing with Russia, Japan also needs to gain the understanding of the United States. Is this the purpose of Hirota's note? (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Tests Charcoal Cars</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The charcoal car invented by the Japanese Army Ministry is testing long-distance driving today. This car does not use gasoline, but charcoal gas. It departed from the Setagaya Army Automobile School this morning and is heading to Shizuoka, Hamamatsu, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara, major cities across the country. The trip is 882 kilometers and is scheduled to be completed in 35 hours. If the next experiment yields satisfactory results, the army's transport trucks will switch to this type of car. (China United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The charcoal car invented by the Japanese Army is being tested this morning. This car does not use a drop of gasoline, but only burns firewood to run, which is no different from an ordinary car. Four charcoal cars are participating in this test this morning, with two ordinary cars following. There are also three trucks loaded with firewood in the rear. The group departed from the Army Automobile School at 8:30 am and drove directly west along the Tokaido. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Famous British General Writes Book Advocating Expansion of Air Force</h3>
<p>Military Equipment Lags Behind, Threatening Sense of Security</p>
<p>(London) According to famous British General Swinton, the British people believe that Britain's security is no longer a problem. In fact, this idea is just an illusion. In his new book (Behind the Smoke Screen), Swinton describes enemy air raids on Britain and Britain's state of non-resistance. According to the book, we cannot complete our protection, nor can we defend against the enemy's air force, because we do not have adequate preparations for aerial defense. The British Air Force, once known as the first, has fallen to sixth since the European War. Swinton sees this as a bad omen for Britain, because the British people do not realize the importance of the air force. Swinton reiterated that the British Navy cannot defend against enemy air attacks. Also, the long-distance flights that are popular today in both civil and military circles are the most powerful new weapons. If these new weapons are used to destroy the enemy's major cities and densely populated areas, the enemy's courage to fight will disappear. Furthermore, although British merchant ships are protected by warships, they may be bombed by the enemy in the air near London and suffer misfortune. It has been found that the air force of a certain European country is now three thousand times larger than before the war. Swinton was formerly the Director of Flying Operations of the British Air Force Department, the British representative to the Geneva Air Force Conference, and the Honorary Chief of Staff of the British Air Force League, so his writings are full of experience.

Traitor Zheng and Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Hirota will discuss general relations between Japan and the puppet regime over several days, especially focusing on the economic alliance and diplomacy between Japan and the puppet regime. Traitor Xi Qia will also discuss financial and economic issues with Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai, Finance Minister Takahashi, and business tycoons from the 6th to the 11th.

<p>(Tokyo) Puppet state envoy Traitor Zheng and others will begin their second step in Japan, which is the important mission of economic cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. This work is very significant because the (Manchukuo) cannot be developed in the future without the help of all aspects of the Japanese economy. Therefore, the issuance of Changchun municipal bonds and (Manchukuo) bonds and other general industrial investments, as well as the basic work of the (Manchukuo) financial community, must rely on the assistance of Japan. It is also scheduled to meet with Finance Minister Takahashi on the evening of the 6th and with Bank of Japan Governor Hijikata on the evening of the 7th. In addition, the financial giants of Japan will also be met to discuss other preparatory matters. Xi's secretary is currently in contact with all parties. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>With Saionji's Support, Saito is Determined to Cling to Power</p>
<p>Planning to Establish Important National Policies</p>
<p>Especially Focusing on Diplomacy and National Defense</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese Prime Minister met with Saionji, he became more optimistic about the future of the political situation. He plans to appoint a Minister of Education and transfer local governors within days, and then convene a meeting of local governors to inject new air into local administration and establish important national policies to show the reason for the cabinet clinging to power. The scope of the Prime Minister's so-called national policies is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Reopen the internal affairs conference to review the internal affairs and national policies of various countries. (2) Step up the promotion of Hirota's diplomacy in order to safely overcome the crisis of 1935 and 1936. (3) Establish a Rice Investigation Committee to determine permanent countermeasures for rice. (4) Because the status of officials is guaranteed, corruption is rampant, so a system of supervisors must be established to correct their injustice and laziness. (5) Decide on a policy of controlling the economy of Manchuria so that the industries of Manchuria are completely under the control of the Japanese government.

<p>(Tokyo) There are various discussions about the true intention behind the Saito Cabinet's decision to maintain power. The most compelling reason is Prime Minister Saito's belief that constitutional politics should be based on party politics. Although he formed the current cabinet to handle an extraordinary situation, he still hopes to return to party politics once his mission is completed. However, considering the current state of political parties, even if he resigns, political power cannot be transferred to a political party. An interim cabinet or a bureaucratic cabinet will inevitably emerge. If that were to happen, the significance of the current cabinet's formation would be lost. Therefore, he decided to maintain power, intending to wait for the rejuvenation of political parties and a smooth transfer of power. (2nd day, Domei News)</p>
<p>Diplomatic Policy: Prince Saionji's Complete Understanding</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito met with Prince Saionji Kimmochi, explaining Foreign Minister Hirota's policy of cooperative diplomacy and obtaining his full support. He requested Prince Saionji's understanding. Foreign Minister's diplomatic policy, although largely clarified in the 65th Diet, can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it will not change its spirit of international cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding China, considering that Japan aims to maintain peace in East Asia, it first hopes for China to stabilize its political situation. At the same time, because of the special relationship between China, Japan, and Manchuria, it is necessary to express a policy of goodwill towards China to gain China's understanding. Then, direct negotiations should be used to resolve pending issues between China and Japan as the basis for maintaining peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>Regarding Russia, as Russia and Manchuria share a border, it will request the Soviet Union to agree to establish demilitarized zones in border areas. In addition, it will resolve various issues such as the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, fisheries, oil fields, oil shale, and forests, and conclude a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union to prevent disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union in advance.</p>
<p>Regarding the United States, there are currently no difficult problems between the two countries, and Japan has no intention of causing trouble. It will continue its good neighborly relations. Although there were estrangements between the peoples of the two countries at the time of the Manchurian Incident, they have now become friendly through the exchange of notes between Hirota and Hull. It is essential to ensure that the United States fully understands the complex and unique situation in East Asia, understands Japan's role as a force for stabilizing peace in East Asia, and guides the Second Washington Conference to success.

<p>Boycott of Japanese Goods: International United Front</p>
<p>Seizing the Opportunity of the International Labor Conference</p>
<p>Unanimous Repudiation of Japan</p>
<p>Japan Threatens to Withdraw its Representatives</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The International Labor Conference will be held in Geneva for three weeks starting on June 4th. According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, countries feeling the pressure of Japanese goods will repudiate Japanese goods at the conference, arguing that the activity of Japanese goods is due to Japan's poor working conditions. Regarding the entry of Japanese goods that sacrifice workers, countries should cooperate with each other to deal with it. Therefore, the foreign affairs authorities take this very seriously. If this movement to exclude Japanese goods becomes public, Japan will not hesitate to withdraw its representatives. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Shigemitsu will explain Japan's industrial and labor conditions and express the government's determination and attitude to Mr. Monnet, the Deputy Director-General of the International Labor Office, who will arrive in Japan on the 3rd.

<p>(Tokyo) A member of the Abyssinian royal family in Northeast Africa wanted to marry a Japanese woman. The prospective princess was Ms. Masako Kuroda, the second daughter of Viscount Kuroda.

It is said that Italy secretly obstructed this marriage, and the Abyssinian Foreign Minister had to cancel the marriage contract. (2nd day, China United Press)</p>

<p>All-India Independence Party: Continuing the Struggle Against the British</p>
<p>Opposing the New Constitution: Unwilling to Be Suppressed</p>
<p>New Delhi: The All-India Independence Party, which has been quiet for some time, held a large meeting here today, deciding to continue the struggle in the new Legislative Assembly elections. An interim committee has been elected to draft a constitution and working procedures, aiming to abolish various oppressive laws and reject the proposals for reforming the Indian constitution contained in the British White Paper. The main points of the British government's plan are as follows: the executive power of the Indian Federation, including the command of the army, navy, and air force, is vested in the Governor-General. The Governor-General has control over and manages the departments of national defense, foreign affairs, and religion. The Governor-General has special responsibilities for the following matters: (1) preventing events that endanger the peace of all or part of India; (2) ensuring the financial stability and credit of the Federation; (3) protecting the legitimate interests of minorities; (4) protecting the various rights and legitimate interests granted to civil servants by the constitution; (5) protecting the rights of the various princely states of India; (6) preventing commercial discrimination; (7) preventing events that impede the administration of the departments under the Governor-General. According to the Indian constitution proposed by the British, the Indian Legislative Assembly shall not pass discriminatory laws, and in particular, shall not pass laws that impose any restrictions or discrimination on British people or British companies in the exercise of certain privileged rights.

<p>Silver Bill in the U.S. Congress</p>
<p>Das Bill Expected to Pass the Senate</p>
<p>Tariff Bill to Be Significantly Modified</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Senator Borah, the Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, it would be difficult to adjourn Congress if there is no clear policy on currency. Borah predicted that the Senate would be able to pass the Das Silver Bill. According to the Das Silver Bill, the U.S. government can exchange U.S. agricultural products for foreign silver and set the price of that silver higher than the ordinary market price. Borah said that according to Weller's proposal, the United States can purchase 50,000,000 ounces of silver per month until 100 million ounces are purchased or the gold-silver ratio reaches 16 to 1. Therefore, Weller's proposal can be an amendment to the Das Bill. It is said that the tariff bill proposed by the administration is very important. According to the bill, the president has the power to sign reciprocal trade agreements with foreign countries. However, the bill has been shelved, and the date for reopening is around April 10th. Some predict that there will be many obstacles to the future of the tariff bill, so the changes to the bill will be greater than when it was in the House of Representatives. However, most leaders in the Senate believe that they will be able to modify the bill to the satisfaction of the White House. It is also heard that the Republican leaders of both the House and Senate have decided to reject the administration's increase in new taxes. According to the administration, after the Independent Offices Appropriations Act was passed by Congress again (i.e., restoring part of the benefits for veterans of the European War and salary cuts for government employees), the burden on the country increased sharply. Therefore, the new tax is necessary. However, Senators McNary and Reed jointly declared that the error in the failure to balance the national budget lies in the unlimited special expenses, and not in the restoration of benefits for veterans and salaries for employees.

<h3>Easter in London</h3>
<p>Ladies Compete to Travel to the Suburbs</p>
<p>(London) During this Easter holiday, the flow of passengers between London and the Continent is unprecedented. For example, on Saturday of last week alone, more than 120 passenger planes took off from Croydon Airport to the European continent. The number of trains connecting to the European continent has also doubled compared to normal days. Although the weather was uncertain that day, which was not conducive to travel, the number of citizens traveling to the seaside was overwhelming. The number of visitors to the major seaside parks has broken all previous records. For example, Blackheath Park received more than 250,000 visitors, while Hastings Park had 100,000 tourists staying there. Conversely, citizens from the provinces also came to visit the capital during the holidays, which was also very crowded. For example, in Hyde Park, the crowds were bustling at noon, and there were no fewer than 250,000 people participating in the fashionable parade. As for Loch Ness in Scotland, it is also a popular holiday destination. On that day, about a thousand cars drove along the lake, and small boats and steamships sailed on the lake. It is said that a strange creature appears in the lake, but whether it exists or not is unknown. Even if it existed, it did not appear on that day, and the tourists returned disappointed without seeing anything. (2nd day, Havas)</p>

<p>Following the U.S. Government's Request</p>
<p>Turkey Prepares to Extradite Insull</p>
<p>Greece's Protection of the Fugitive Backfires</p>
<p>A Year of Overseas Freedom Ultimately Fails to Escape</p>
<p>The claim that Constantine Insull has been detained by Turkish authorities pending his return to the United States for trial has been confirmed this afternoon. (2nd day, Reuters)</p>
<p>Istanbul (Turkey): The wanted American millionaire Samuel Insull, who previously passed through Turkish territory on a Greek ship, was detained by Turkish authorities. Today, the Turkish court acquitted him and released him. However, as Insull walked out of the court and was about to get into a car, he was arrested again by Turkish police. Currently, the Greek Foreign Minister has lodged a serious protest with Turkey, objecting to the illegal arrest of Insull, while the U.S. government is urging Turkey to extradite Insull to the United States as soon as possible. The three countries are engaging in intense negotiations over the Insull affair, with telegrams flying back and forth like snowflakes, making it very lively. Today, the Turkish cabinet finally decided to transfer Insull to the United States. (2nd day, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Ankara: Samuel Insull, the American who has been living in exile overseas for more than a year, will be extradited by Turkey at the request of the U.S. government. Yesterday, Insull disembarked from the ship and was questioned by the Third Criminal Court for several hours. The court issued a verdict, and the translator made a mistake, saying that the court recognized Insull as not an American and free to come and go. In fact, the court recognized Insull as an American and recognized that the crime he committed was neither political nor military, but an ordinary case. On this point, Insull could be freed. However, the case file must be sent to the cabinet, which will decide on the extradition issue. This was the general meaning of the verdict. Soon after, the Turkish cabinet, at the request of the U.S. government, ordered that Insull be sent back to the United States. Insull's life as a fugitive overseas has come to an end. It is said that Insull's public utility stock company failed in the United States in 1932, involving a huge amount of 200 million yuan. In October of that year, Insull was accused of embezzling huge sums of money, and Insull fled to Europe, first to France, then to Rome, and then to Greece. Finally, due to repeated negotiations by the U.S. government, Insull could not live in peace and secretly hired a ship to leave Athens. Unexpectedly, he was detained by the Turkish government when he arrived at the Bosphorus Strait. It is heard that he will be handed over to the U.S. authorities in Constantinople and sent back to Chicago for trial. What is noteworthy is that although the Turkish-American extradition treaty has been signed, it has not yet been ratified by Congress, but the Turkish cabinet has already made this decision.

<h3>U.S. Forms Third Party</h3>
<p>Western States Dissatisfied with the Current Government</p>
<p>(Washington) American young people are planning to form a new party outside of the two major parties, the Democratic and Republican parties. This movement is brewing and may occupy an important position in the next election. In addition, people in the western regions and mountainous states of the United States are not very satisfied with the current government, believing that the current government favors the eastern and Pacific coastal states while ignoring the interests of the western mountainous regions. Although people in these regions lack a common traditional concept, it is easier to organize a new party because of this feeling of dissatisfaction with the current political situation. In general, the western states have strongly criticized some points in the current economic program, and it is especially difficult to recognize the policy of reducing agricultural production. On the contrary, most of the western agricultural regions advocate increasing agricultural production to the maximum and demand that the government protect their interests. In addition, the government's failure to fully increase the price of silver is also a disappointment to the people in the west. In short, it is still difficult to determine whether the youth movement has the possibility of development. In American history, all previous attempts to organize a third political party have failed, so it is still uncertain whether this new party will succeed. (2nd day, Havas)</p>
<h3>Korean Independence Party Secretly Active in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Plotting to Assassinate Key Japanese Political Figures</p>
<p>The Plot Was Discovered Due to Lack of Secrecy</p>
<p>Two Korean Patriots Arrested</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on March 29th that the Special Higher Police Department of the Metropolitan Police Department and the Korean Section have recently been in a state of sudden tension. Section Chief [omitted names] and Inspectors [omitted names], together with the Hongo Fuji Police Station, were secretly engaged in large-scale activities. Two Koreans who claimed to be [omitted names] were arrested in a certain place. As a result of strict interrogation, a certain ideological incident was discovered. Unexpectedly, a headquarters was recently established in a certain place, plotting a Korean independence movement. The above two people, under the command of a fake government, attempted to assassinate high-ranking Japanese officials and destroy key national institutions, etc. It was also found that the two criminals were in the same party as Lee Bong-chang, who caused an unknown incident outside Sakurada Gate in January of the previous year. This Korean independence movement fake government is also related to the bombing of General Shirakawa and the injury of Ueda Shigemitsu in Hongkou Park in Shanghai in the previous year. They also intended to take destabilizing actions against Zheng Xiaoxu and Xi Qia, who are currently visiting Japan for betrothal. Therefore, the Metropolitan Police Department considers this major conspiracy to be an extremely serious case.</p>
<h3>Central National Government: Reports on Two Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo: Controlled Economy</p>
<p>Lin Sen: The Meaning of the New Life</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 124th Memorial Week at 9:00 am on the 2nd. Members of the Central Committee [omitted names] and staff members, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Zhang Ji presided over the meeting. Chen Gongbo reported on the preliminary problems of the controlled economy, stating that the outcry for a controlled economy is not as high as last year because there have been no special achievements after its implementation. The so-called controlled economy is to control existing production enterprises that have basic conditions. However, there are many difficulties in implementing a controlled economy in China, and they must be eliminated one by one to see results. For example: (1) The cotton industry has problems such as cotton seed transportation, yarn mill management, and the exchange; (2) The silk industry should first solve the problems of improving the original silkworm varieties, silk reeling machines, and promotion; (3) For food, attention must first be paid to transportation; (4) For the coal industry, effective reforms should be made to mine management. Only in this way can real results be seen. Therefore, today, the controlled economy can only be effective if: (1) the policy is resolute; (2) the institutions are simple; (3) the government is united; (4) the situation is clear; (5) the action is strong. Then the above-mentioned obstacles cannot exist, and the controlled economy can be effective. (2nd day, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 2nd. [Omitted names] and staff members of various ministries and commissions, totaling six to seven hundred people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and reported, stating that since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the whole country has been stirred up. The New Life is what the ancients called, "renewing it day after day, making new people." We must restore the decadence of the past and invigorate the laxity. The New Life Movement is based on the individual, and the individual's behavior, such as diet, daily life, speech, and action, is conditioned by diligence and hardship. If the individual is like this, then the society is renewed, and then it is popularized throughout the country. If everyone works hard on this movement, the whole country can be transformed into a new one. I hope that the people of the country will work together. (2nd day, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government: Plans to Build a Tonghai Railway</h3>

The route starts from Nantong, passes through Dongtai, Rugao, Yancheng, Huai'an, Lianshui and other counties, and reaches Haizhou, with a length of about 470 li. The provincial government invited local gentry to form an inspection team, which set out for inspection a month ago, and sent three engineers, leading 20 technicians, to measure in various places. This month, it can be completed, and then land and materials can be purchased, and construction can begin in June. The total project cost is estimated to be 2.2 million yuan for purchasing the foundation, 35 million yuan for materials, and 35 million yuan for construction costs.

The outside world misunderstood the gold standard as a pseudo-gold standard. Peng specifically stated that he suggested that the Central Bank issue gold banknotes with 60% cash reserves and 40% security reserves to recover the constantly outflowing cash and to make the people of the country have the habit of using gold coins, so that it would be convenient to switch to the gold standard in the future.

<h3>Guangdong Authorities Apply for Allocation of Cotton and Wheat Loans</h3>

<p>(Guangzhou) It is heard that the leaders of Guangdong Province have recently submitted a request to the Central Government to allocate a portion of the U.S. cotton and wheat loans in order to implement Guangdong Province's three-year plan. The telegram has been jointly sent by Lin Yunhai and Chen Jitang. As for the exact amount of the requested funds, it is not known. It is generally believed that Guangdong Province has recently experienced an economic panic, and due to the failure of negotiations on borrowing funds from the Hong Kong banking community, it has made a renewed request to the Central Government to allocate a portion of the U.S. cotton and wheat loans. Although Guangdong Province is currently facing economic difficulties, it is still making unremitting progress on plans such as building the Pearl River New Bridge and establishing cotton, wool, sugar, and paper factories. The amount of expenses for this item is not small, and the current military expenditure has increased from 4.5 million yuan per month to 5 million yuan. (1st day, Reuters)</p>

He was also invited to the Guangdong Provincial Judicial and Administrative Conference to deliver a speech as a chief official. In addition, he was busy with family affairs all day. As for the situation in Guangdong Province, what is known is that public security is relatively stable, but the number of unemployed overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province is increasing due to the global economic recession and the impact of falling gold prices, and the huge amount of annual remittances to Guangdong has also stopped, which is worrying. The unemployment of overseas Chinese is a very serious problem at present and should be given special attention. (2nd day, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japan Actively Expands the Transportation Network in the Northeast,</h3>
<p>Connecting Railway Lines and Opening Automobile Roads</p>
<p>Facilitating Military Transportation, Defending Against Russia, and Eliminating Righteous Armies</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: In order to defend against Russia, rule the rural areas of the Northeast, and eliminate the Righteous Army, Japan is extending the existing railways in the Northeast, constructing branch lines and light railways, and opening automobile roads in areas where railways cannot be laid. This is all in preparation for Japan's active war transportation. The names and extensions of the railway and automobile road sections are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Extension of the Lahar Route: The South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu) has incorporated the operation of railways in various parts of the Northeast. Tanabe, the Deputy Director of the Mantetsu Construction Bureau, the Director of the Mountain Railway General Engineering Office, and Sato, the Chief of the Engineering Section of the Transportation Supervision Department of the Japanese Kwantung Army, have jointly announced that the Hu-Hai and Qi-Ke lines, which started construction at the end of last winter, the 190-kilometer section between Tai-Hai and Hailun, and the 40-kilometer extension of the Lahar branch line between Lahar and Nehe, as well as the construction of other station buildings, were completed in March of this year.</p>
<p>Korean Jilin Convenience Road: Several Japanese capitalists are planning to build a light railway in eastern Jilin, starting from the Korean border and reaching Shimenzi directly. Tumenzi is located where Jilin borders Soviet Russia, right in the middle of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) and Jihui Railway. Construction of this railway began this spring and is scheduled to be completed in July. The route passes through Hunchun, an important town close to the Russian border. The entire line is 110 kilometers long and requires a total of 250,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Railway Construction Plan: Under the command of the Japanese, the Railway General Administration of the Puppet State of Manchukuo is eager to complete its planned railway network to facilitate military transportation in order to intensify preparations for attacking Soviet Russia and suppressing the anti-Japanese Righteous Army. The following is a summary of the road construction plan for this year proposed by the State Railway Construction Office of the Puppet State: Kuantong Road, from Kuandian to Tonghua, 229 kilometers long; Tongji Road, from Tonghua to Ji'an, 94 kilometers long; Kaitong Road, from Kaiyuan to Tongjiangkou, 37 kilometers long; Huanxin Road, from Huanren to Xinbin, 80 kilometers long; Tonglin Road, from Tonghua to Linjiang, 139 kilometers long; Dafeng Road, from Dagushan to Fenghuangcheng, 95 kilometers long; Haigu Road, from Haicheng to Dagushan, 171 kilometers long; Pingxi Road, from Pingquan to Xifengkou, 92 kilometers long; Lingleng Road, from Lingyuan to Lengkou, 165 kilometers long; Chicheng Road, from Chifeng to Chengde, 225 kilometers long. The total length is 1,327 kilometers. Among the above-mentioned roads planned for construction, the section from Dagushan to Fenghuangcheng was started last year and is expected to be completed in June of this year.</p>
<p>Military Automobile Roads: The Japanese are building automobile roads in the Northeast in the name of commercial operations, but in reality, it is in preparation for war transportation. The operating lines that have already started are the Chaoyang-Chifeng line and the temporary operating lines between Dunhua-Hailin and Chifeng-Chengde, which were all implemented last year. Recently, other lines will be built. The following is a list of the routes that have been opened to traffic: (1) Chaoyang-Chifeng; (2) Chifeng-Chengde; (3) Harbin-Tongjiang; (4) Dunhua-Hailin; (5) Shanchengzhen-Tonghua; (6) Xinjing-Fuyu; (7) Nehe-Heihe; (8) Fengtian-Fushun; (9) Xinjing-Jilin; (10) Taonan-Suolun.</p>
<p>2,000 Kilometers of Highways: The Japanese plan to complete 2,000 kilometers of automobile highways in Liaoning and Rehe provinces by the end of April this year. 1,725 kilometers were completed last year, and automobiles have been running since last year. The following are some well-known routes: Liaoyang-Liaozhong, 59 kilometers long; Beishanchengzi-Liuhe, 37 kilometers long; Nanzamum-Xinbin, 88 kilometers long; Qiaotou-Da'anping, 35 kilometers long; Beipiao-Chaoyang, 40 kilometers long; Chaoyang-Lingyuan, 25 kilometers long; Lingyuan-Pingquan, 92 kilometers long; Chengde-Gubeikou, 90 kilometers long; Chaoyang-Chifeng, 164 kilometers long; Zhuanghe-Dagushan, 71 kilometers long; Tieling-Kangping, 82 kilometers long; Kuandian-Changdianhekou, 50 kilometers long; Liaoyang-Lishan, 21 kilometers long; Anshan-Qilingzi, 14 kilometers long; Anshan-Tanggangzi, 12 kilometers long; Andong-Dagushan, 90 kilometers long; Zhuanghe-Chengzituan, 55 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Planned Automobile Road Network: After the automobile section of the Japan Railway General Bureau merged with the Mantetsu automobile section, it actively carried out the so-called Manchukuo automobile network plan. Recently, what can be realized in its plan, such as the route between Harbin and Fujin, has already started transportation. Those that will be opened this year, such as Andong-Chengzituan and Tonghua-Shanchengzhen, require about 100 vehicles. Recently, in addition to adopting transportation on various opened lines, automobile offices have been established in order to realize their ambitions. The following are the routes in the plan: Beipiao-Chengde, 320 kilometers long; Chaoyang-Chifeng, 190 kilometers long (the above have already been opened); Andong-Chengzituan, 236 kilometers long; Changchun-Fuyu, 166 kilometers long; Shenyang-Fushun, 43 kilometers long; Shanchengzhen-Tonghua, 236 kilometers long; Chengde-Chifeng, 237 kilometers long; Harbin-Tongjiang, 616 kilometers long (the above lines were opened in the spring of 1934); Harbin-Bin County, 104 kilometers long; Dunhua-Hailin, 224 kilometers long; Nehe-Daheihe, 280 kilometers long; Lahar-Nehe, 235 kilometers long; Nanzamum-Tonghua, 189 kilometers long; Taonan-Suolun, 220 kilometers long; Qiansuo-Shimenqin, 40 kilometers long; Yingkou-Gaiping, 39 kilometers long; Niuzhuang-Haicheng, 23 kilometers long; Tanggangzi-Liaoyang, 40 kilometers long. The above lines are being rapidly implemented and are expected to be completed next year, totaling about 3,238 kilometers. This automobile network occupies an extremely important position in industry, politics, and military affairs, and it is hoped that the people of the country will pay attention to it.

<h3>Bankruptcy of Rural Economy in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Blocking Grain and Stone and Using Bogus Stocks to Buy</p>
<p>Market Price Collapse Makes Farmers Lose More Than They Gain</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have fallen one after another. For two years, the people of the Northeast have been subjected to the ravages of the Japanese army. After the emergence of the puppet organization, it outwardly claimed to abolish exorbitant taxes, but in reality, it levied them indiscriminately and without limit. In addition, there were disturbances by bandits and disasters from floods. The rural economy has been completely bankrupt. Last year's harvest was still abundant, and the farmers thought they could get a little warmth and satiety. Unexpectedly, the Japanese manipulated the Northeast economy, implementing a blockade of grain and stone and prohibiting exports. They also imposed heavy taxes on soybeans exported to Japan, a poisonous plan that could not be worse. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Grain and Stone Exports</h3>
<p>Northeast agricultural products have always been in surplus. In order to bankrupt the rural economy and drive farmers out of their homeland, the Japanese prohibited the export of grain and stone, implementing a cheap grain poison plan. The grain earned by the farmers' hard work is not enough for trade, and life will be even more difficult. If all grain and stone are sold at market prices, the proceeds are only one-third of the annual cost. The Japanese took this opportunity to issue stocks and buy them at double the market price, allowing farmers to get one-tenth of the cash and issuing stocks for the remaining amount at double the price, ostensibly to encourage farmers to invest in the construction of the railway around Mantetsu, nominally a people's railway. In this way, the Japanese used bogus stocks to buy up all the grain and stone in the Northeast. Once there are natural disasters or man-made calamities, famine will inevitably be felt, causing all the farmers to leave their homeland in order to achieve their aggressive ambitions.</p>
<h3>Taxes on Soybeans Exported to Japan</h3>
<p>The Northeast exports 380,000 koku (a unit of measurement) of soybeans to Japan every year, worth 50 million yuan. Japan relies on soybeans for the manufacture of edible oil, soap, grease, and other raw materials. Therefore, soybeans used for oil production are specially exempted from tax. However, each type of vegetable seed that is a raw material for oil production cultivated in Japan is subject to the resistance of soybeans. Recently, in order to encourage vegetable seed cultivation, Japanese agricultural and forestry families will abolish the tax exemption order for soybeans used for oil production in accordance with the regulations of the 14th year of the Taisho period of the tariff revision law and levy half tax as in previous years.</p>
<h3>Plummeting Grain Prices</h3>
<p>The Northeast economy is now completely in the hands of the Japanese. The grain obtained through the hard work of our farmers is being arbitrarily priced by the Japanese, causing a sharp drop in value to the level of mud and sand. The grain prices of the Harbin banks and current grain merchants are listed below:</p>
<p>Last Year's Grain Prices at Banks</p>
<p>Category: Yuan Dou (Round Soybean) / Wheat / Ling Mai (Flaxseed) / Barley / Su Zi (Perilla Seed) / Sesame</p>

<p>The prices listed are the Harbin currency value per "Pu," with one "Pu" equivalent to 30 kilograms, and one Harbin Yuan equivalent to 1.25 silver Yuan.</p>
<h3>Deteriorating Miners' Strike in Tangshan</h3>
<p>Miners Hold Marches and Demonstrations</p>
<p>The Labor Dispute Spreads Throughout the War Zone</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The Kailuan Tangshan miners' strike, after Tao Shangming and Zhao Xun, in conjunction with the local Chamber of Commerce chairman and local gentry, discussed matters with the strike representatives. The workers had divided their proposed twelve demands into two parts: one concerning compensation for the deceased and injured, and the other concerning miners' treatment. Regarding the compensation issue, the demands to the Public Security Bureau were: (1) each of the three workers killed should receive 2,000 Yuan in compensation at once, and the injured should receive 500 Yuan; (2) the platoon leader Cheng of the Public Security Bureau's security team, who opened fire and killed the workers, should be punished; (3) Wang Dexin, the captain of the Public Security Bureau's mining area security team, should be punished. The Public Security Bureau agreed to all of the above conditions. Platoon Leader Cheng was immediately arrested, and Wang Dexin was allowed a grace period. An initial 700 Yuan was allocated for coffin expenses, with the remaining total of 11,000 Yuan to be paid within four days, starting from the 27th. After the workers' successful negotiation with the Public Security Bureau, they turned to the mining company with their demands, including the important conditions: (1) all internal and external workers of the six mines of Kailuan should receive an increase of 8 silver cents on their original wages; (2) an increase in bonuses for external workers, and the company should extract 4 silver cents per ton of coal produced annually and distribute it to the external workers. However, each person should receive at least 15 Yuan per year, and each external worker would tentatively receive 12 Yuan. If they switched to internal work, they should enjoy the same treatment as internal workers. The mining company refused to accept these demands. Tao Shangming and the mediators suggested that the workers make concessions, proposing that the 4 cents per ton was too much, and the annual bonus per person should start from a minimum of 15 Yuan up to 18 Yuan. Using this as a principle, they negotiated with the mining company. The mining company, due to its relationship with the four mines of Majiagou, Zhaogezhuang, Linxi, and Guye, feared that if the conditions of the Tangshan miners were agreed upon, the workers of the four eastern mines would also demand the same. Therefore, they did not agree with the mediators' proposals. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau had agreed to allocate the compensation fees, but the director, Zhao Xun, believed that the police had shot and killed the workers to protect the Kailuan engineers and underground workers, and the fees should be paid by the mining company. However, the mining company believed that this was not the responsibility of the mining bureau itself and refused to allocate the funds. Zhao Xun was quite dissatisfied. On the 29th, the agreed-upon payment date, it was not fulfilled. The workers believed they were being deceived, so at 2 p.m. that afternoon, they gathered over a thousand people and gave speeches in front of the Caishen Temple (Temple of the God of Wealth). Zhao Dazhong, the newly elected chairman of the "War Zone Workers' Autonomous United General Labor Union," gave a very impassioned speech. Then, holding spears, knives, wooden sticks, etc., they marched through the streets, holding demonstrations and shouting various slogans. On the 30th, at 1 p.m., they continued the march, and the slogans they shouted were even clearer than the previous day, such as "(Down with Zhao Xun)," "(Down with the labor union that doesn't reform)," "(Not recognizing the labor union that doesn't reform)," "(Down with the Public Security Bureau chief who doesn't keep his word)," "(Down with Zhao Xun, who lacks sincerity)," "(Down with the mining bureau that doesn't fulfill the 20-year contract and deceives the workers)," "(Support Commissioner Tao)," "(Welcome Mr. Zhao Dazhong)," etc. They still started from the Caishen Temple, passed through Guangdong Street, the Public Security Bureau, West Ma Road, Xinli Street, East Xin Street, and dispersed at Liangshi Street (Grain Market Street). Although the mining company knew that the labor dispute was deteriorating, it wanted to endure the pain for the moment and resolve the issue fundamentally. Therefore, it did not make any overt expressions, intending to wait for the government to suppress the workers and force them to stop their activities and resume work automatically. Tao Shangming, Zhao Xun, and others wanted the mining company to temporarily accept the conditions to quell the labor dispute. There was a slight difference of opinion between the mining bureau and the government, so the unrest continued to expand. On the 30th, the striking workers contacted rickshaw pullers and formed a rickshaw pullers' union, also electing Zhao Dazhong as the chairman. In all counties in the war zone with factories, the Tangshan mine sent workers to instigate action. Workers in factories such as Malanyu and Qinhuangdao all showed signs of unrest. Over a thousand male and female workers at the Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory suddenly went on strike on the morning of the 30th, making three demands to the factory: (1) restore the original work procedures; (2) implement the wage increase method every three years; (3) remove the officials who abuse workers. After the workers went on strike, they elected 27 male workers and 7 female workers as maintenance team leaders, and 200 male and female workers as maintenance team members, occupying the factory and changing shifts according to the time. The workers remained at their original work positions but did not work. Zhao Dazhong arrived at the factory that day and gave a speech to the workers, telling them to unite and support the Tangshan miners to achieve their goals. Therefore, the entire city of Tangshan had been tense again since the 30th, and the strike was threatening to spread to the counties in the war zone. (March 30th)</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Arrives in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Assisting with Southwest Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Advocating Unified Political Affairs</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Li Zongren had been away from Guangdong and returned to Guangxi for a long time. Recently, due to important Southwest political matters awaiting resolution, he specially arrived in Guangdong from Guangxi on the 27th of this month to cancel his leave with the Southwest Political Affairs Council and assist in all political affairs. Those who came with Li included Mrs. Li, Guo Dejie, and staff officers Qiu Changwei, Wen Qiaosheng, etc. Those who had previous ties with Li here all went to the Shiweitang Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway Station to welcome him. After Li arrived in Guangdong, he drove to his private residence in Mapenggang to rest briefly. Then, he went to the Political Affairs Council to meet with committee members Chen Jitang, Zou Lu, Lin Yungai, Deng Zheru, and others, and participated in the 113th meeting of the Political Affairs Council that day. Outside sources say that Li's visit to Guangdong this time is to discuss the reform of the provincial system in Guangdong and Guangxi, the selection of future governors of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the establishment of a military branch council in the Southwest. Once decided, Guangdong and Guangxi will have a clear expression. However, Li told people yesterday that he had not mentioned the above issues. Li's main point was that his visit to Guangdong was to assist in Southwest political affairs. It is rumored that the central government intends to abolish the two high-level Southwest agencies, but he has not received official news. He does not know the details of the reform of the provincial system and cannot express his opinion. Hong Kong newspapers have reported news of the establishment of a military branch council in the Southwest, but he has not received confirmed reports either, and does not know the situation. His current opinion on the current situation is to support construction, implement sincere unity, and unite against foreign aggression to save the critical situation. As for the suppression of bandits, it has not yet been decided whether Guangxi Province will increase troops to enter Jiangxi to assist in suppressing the communist bandits. The security situation in Guangxi Province is currently quite peaceful. He recently went to Nanzhai to meet with Wang Jialie, the chairman of Guizhou Province. The discussions were only about developing transportation construction between Guizhou and Guangxi, and did not involve major military and political plans. Furthermore, his recent trip to Vietnam was also of a recreational nature, to help reconcile relations between China and France. Guangxi Province currently focuses on construction and intends to greatly expand its air force, but due to limited financial resources, a complete plan has not yet been realized. Chen Jitang, because Li had been away from Guangdong for a long time, specially held a banquet at his private residence in Meihuacun on the afternoon of the 27th to welcome Li back, and invited party, military, and government officials to accompany him. They only dispersed after 7 p.m. (March 28th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Villagers Clashing Over Lantern Festival Stopped</h3>
<p>Recently, the enthusiasm for lantern festivals among farmers in various towns and villages in Punan has been very strong. The county government and Public Security Bureau have repeatedly received reports and are preparing to issue a ban. Last night (the 1st), several thousand farmers in Tinglin Town suddenly had a large number of iconographic paper lanterns and lion and dragon lanterns, stretching for several miles. The wilderness was illuminated by candlelight, and the townspeople gathered to watch, creating an extremely crowded scene. Yang, of the Second Branch Bureau of the town, fearing that it would lead to trouble, and believing that the lantern festival was a wasteful and useless activity, urgently needed to be banned, specially sent police officers to suppress it. Villagers had a misunderstanding, starting with verbal disagreements, then escalating into mutual clashes, with one echoing another, turning into a confrontational situation. Later, Zhang Baoxiong, the head of the district, came out to persuade them, and the unrest subsided. Zhou Ding, the director of the Public Security Bureau, dispatched Inspector Zhu Song'an to investigate after receiving a telegram from the branch bureau. The extent of damage to the branch bureau's buildings during the villagers' riot has not yet been detailed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Fisherman and Water Birds Perish Together</h3>
<p>Zhang Rongfu, a fisherman from Xiangcheng Township, was 61 years old and usually made a living by using water birds to catch fish. Unexpectedly, all 71 of his water birds suddenly died the other day. Zhang Rongfu suddenly felt unable to make a living and hanged himself to death yesterday (the 2nd) morning.</p>
<h3>Fire Kills Two Children</h3>
<p>No. 2 Yuecheng along the street of Nantongzimen outside of Suchow's Changmen Gate suddenly caught fire at around 10 a.m. yesterday (the 2nd) after an accident, and was extinguished only after various fire brigades dispatched fire engines to fight the blaze. More than ten houses were destroyed. Yunzhen, an eight-year-old girl from the Fang Dequan household, and Huiyuan, a six-year-old girl from the Zhu Chen household, died, because they were playing upstairs when the fire broke out and could not escape in time. At the time of the fire, Shanghai Fudan University Boy Scouts traveling to Suzhou happened to pass by the area, acted righteously and bravely, and helped fight the fire. Because they heard children calling for help upstairs, they wanted to bravely climb the stairs to rescue them, but the firefighters, fearing danger, prevented them from entering.</p>
<h3>Arson by an Enemy Leads to the Tragic Death of Two Girls</h3>
<p>The house of Qian Arong in Sunjiaqiao, 3rd Tu, 10th Du, Fengqiao Township, was suddenly set on fire by an enemy at around 9 p.m. on the 1st night. At that time, all eight or nine members of the family were asleep. Qian Arong was awakened from his sleep and saw the raging fire. He immediately fled. He saw someone fleeing with a torch in hand. After the villagers tried to extinguish the fire, the result was that four houses with two sides were reduced to ashes. Xu Qiaodi, Qian Arong's twelve-year-old adopted daughter, and Jinmei, his six-year-old daughter, were unable to escape and tragically died in the fire. The police district in charge has apprehended a suspect, Li Fuquan, the arsonist, and is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: The Case of Li Shuyun Takes a Favorable Turn</h3>
<p>The case of Liu Zhuomin, the former director of the Second Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau of this county, refusing to hand over the seal of office, involving Li Shuyun, the wife of Gu Renfa, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been reported in detail in this newspaper. The latest news obtained is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Summons Issued</h3>
<p>Since the county court's prosecutor's office took on the case for investigation, it has telegraphed Gu Renfa to appear in court for questioning. At that time, because Gu had gone to Jiangxi and had not returned, he did not appear in court. Later, it was rumored that the prosecutor's office had issued a second summons. In fact, the second summons was just issued yesterday. The summoned parties are Director Gu and Huang Xutan, the commander of the First District Water Police Junhe Jian. Gu's summons was requested to be forwarded to the provincial government, with the court date being April 4th. Huang's summons was entrusted to the Shanghai Special District Court for delivery, with the court date being April 6th. However, it is widely rumored in the county that Gu Renfa came to Wuxi at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, and his whereabouts were very secret. After getting off the train, he went straight to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Yan for discussion. Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor of the county court, also went to meet him for a long time. He returned to the town that evening. However, inquiries with the authorities did not confirm this statement. However, Pan Songru, a Zhenjiang lawyer hired by Gu, did come to Wuxi yesterday and stayed at Room 46 of the Wuxi Hotel and made contact. Before leaving, he told the accountant of the Wuxi Hotel that if the court had a summons for Director Gu, please collect it on his behalf and forward it.</p>
<h3>Suing Gu for Bigamy</h3>
<p>Since Lawyer Chao Kun represented Li Shuyun in preparing to sue Gu for bigamy, he has been actively collecting evidence. It has now been found that Gu took a group photo with Ai Chengmei and their children at the Qixin Photo Studio in Hankou on July 17th, 1931. The photo number is 255. Because the time of the photo was after his marriage to Li Shuyun (married to Li Shuyun on June 20th, 1931), the photo is indeed one of the key evidences in this case. Yesterday, a special express letter was sent to the Qixin Photo Studio to request that the negative be kept for evidence. Also, among the evidence submitted by Director Gu, there was a letter from Wu Zonghua, etc., to Gu, in which the content was extremely critical of Li Shuyun. Local newspapers in this county have recorded this matter, but yesterday Wu Zonghua sent a letter to Wuxi to correct the record, denying that he had sent a letter to Gu slandering Li Shuyun. This is indeed a mystery. Li Shuyun's father, Li Zhengcheng, who is currently the head of the cash department of the Hunan Provincial Bank, has heard about this matter and has decided to come to Wuxi in the coming days to seek justice for his daughter.</p>
<h3>Evidence Complete</h3>
<p>Li Shuyun's defense plea has been drafted and finalized by Lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun. The content includes: (1) Gu Renfa should be held responsible for producing Wu Zonghua to court to testify regarding the slanderous letter submitted by Gu Renfa from Wu Zonghua, otherwise he is suspected of forgery; (2) The receipt for 200 Yuan given by Li Shuyun to Huang Xutan, the commander of the Water Police Junhe Jian, was not written by Li herself, but was given by Yi Shouming, a friend of Huang Yi'ou, and this money was not an illegal bribe, because Li came to Shanghai for medical treatment on the 13th of last month and did not bring much money. She sent a letter to Secretary Wan of the Civil Affairs Department to send money to Shanghai. Wan then sent Commander Huang to send 200 Yuan to the residence of Huang Yi'ou, and Yi Shouming issued a receipt, which can be testified by Yi Shouming; (3) Regarding Li Shuyun coming to Wuxi to instigate Liu Zhuomin to resist the handover, Li went to Shanghai for medical treatment on the 13th and has never taken a step beyond Shanghai until she was arrested, which can be testified by Dr. Kong and Committee Member Huang Yi'ou; (4) Gu Renfa admits to misjudging people, and Liu Zhuomin was also appointed by Gu, and is not a private relative of the Li family, so how could Li instruct him to resist the handover; (5) The Civil Affairs Department has a seal supervisor and an examiner, and the seal is in the Civil Affairs Department, not in a private residence, so how could Li Shuyun steal it; (6) Gu's commission of bigamy and fraud is fully evidenced and cannot be denied; (7) Gu's accusation that Shuyun sold offices and collected money should provide solid evidence, otherwise Gu should be held responsible for false accusation; (8) There is also a detailed defense regarding the arrest of Li's mother, requesting that she be acquitted as well. Yesterday morning, Li Shuyun's uncle Li Wenhui and others came to Wuxi from Shanghai to visit Shuyun at the detention center. Shuyun's condition is gradually improving.</p>
<h3>Qin Liankui's Remarks</h3>
<p>It is widely rumored that Director Gu has hired Lawyers Qin Liankui and Wang Youling as legal advisors, and has contacted Lawyer Zhang Shizhao to seek a reconciliation with Li. According to Lawyer Qin, Gu did hire him, but he did not accept the offer, let alone proceed with reconciliation. Moreover, Gu's position as director is a matter of reporting a subordinate, which is not comparable to a personal lawsuit. Currently, it is the investigation period, and no public prosecution has been filed, so there is no need to appear in court for defense.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Public Security Branch Bureaus Implemented Reduction and Merger</h3>
<p>Xu Baoguang, the director of the Wuyi County Public Security Bureau, submitted the plan to reorganize the county's branch bureaus and the reorganization and merger situation to County Magistrate Cai Pei, who personally presented it to Director Gu of the province for inspection and approval. It was considered that the number of police officers, the number of firearms and ammunition, the salaries of police officers, and the location of the establishments all met the standards of the province's reorganization plan for the counties' public security bureau. A special order was given to return to Changzhou to implement the plan. According to the bureau's announcement, four branch bureaus will be established in the city and the four locations of Ximen and Xiaohe and Qishuyan. Ten branch offices will be established in other townships and towns.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Farmers in Huangshan Port Unearth Antiquities</h3>
<p>Zhao Youlang, a farmer in Huangshan Port, discovered three stone slabs that looked like tombstones in a gully on Shajia Mountain on the southern slope of Huangshan the other day. Knowing that there was something unusual, he dug open the stone slabs. Inside was an ancient pit, built with bricks around, which was quite sturdy. The inside was a dark heap, which turned into powder when disturbed. Later, a Korean bottle was found, which was used by Han Xin during his military campaign in the Former Han Dynasty. The bottle contained half a bottle of yellow mud, a bronze mirror, about five inches in diameter, with plum blossoms around it, and the words "Luzhou Zhen Shijia Nian Bazhi Zhaozi" engraved on it. There were also more than twenty Han coins. Unfortunately, the villagers did not recognize them and sold them cheaply to a Tao family nearby.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Price Reduction Dispute in Shanghai-Haimen Shipping</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Haimen shipping line originally had five companies: Xinrenhe, Jufeng, Dada, Pingan, and Daxing. In recent years, due to poor business, Jufeng Company's Haimen ship has been sold to others, and Pingan Company's Xinshengda ship has been rerouted to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. Other companies also find it difficult to maintain operations. However, the Daxing Company's Daxing and Fuxing ships suddenly posted price reduction advertisements the other day to attract customers. When the various companies found out about this, they considered this move to be a suicidal policy for the shipping industry. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the Ministry of Communications, the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and the Shipping Association to find a way to stop it, so as to avoid mutual destruction.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Leng Yuqiu and Others Prepare to Establish a National Products Company</h3>
<p>Major figures in Shanghai's financial and industrial circles, in view of our country's backward production and economic poverty, the import of foreign goods, increasing year after year, with an annual trade deficit of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of yuan, a huge outflow, which is truly alarming, have jointly organized the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association to jointly develop production and prosper the economy in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. The national product factories participating in the association all supply the China National Products Companies in various places with extremely high-quality goods at low prices, aiming to save the outflow of resources and revitalize the nation, which is a crucial plan to save the country. Wang Shuqing, the manager of the Bank of China in Zhenjiang, and Leng Yuqiu, Yan Huizi, Yang Gongya, and other major figures in the business and academic circles, in order to prosper the market in the provincial capital and develop domestic production, have specially jointly initiated the establishment of the Zhenjiang China National Products Co., Ltd. with the Shanghai National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association and major national product factories. The share capital is tentatively set at 30,000 yuan, with each share being 20 yuan, so as to encourage enthusiastic patriots to actively participate, in order to practically promote the sales of national products and recover the outflow of resources. It is now said that a considerable amount of capital has been raised, and the preparatory office is located at No. 81 Wangjia Lane. The Bank of China in Zhenjiang has begun to collect payments for shares on its behalf. It is heard that the company's goods are all supplied by national product factories in Shanghai and various provinces, carefully selected excellent and novel goods, and the principle of small profits is adopted, in order to reduce the import of foreign goods. It is heard that people from all walks of life are enthusiastically supporting it, and the company will definitely be established soon, adding luster to the provincial capital of Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Automobile Adds Early Departures</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Long-Distance Bus Company, because the days are longer in the spring and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has changed the timetable and added trains for the convenience of travelers, and because the company has a joint transportation agreement with the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, the departure times should be more carefully coordinated. The company has added an extra trip each day on the routes, to be implemented on April 3rd. The early departures from Yangzhou to Zhenjiang are: (1) 6:30 a.m., (2) 8:00 a.m., (3) 9:40 a.m., (4) 10:40 a.m., (5) 2:00 p.m., (6) 4:40 p.m., (7) 6:40 p.m. The departures from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou will be ten minutes later for each trip.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Three Villages Report Thefts Simultaneously</h3>
<p>More than thirty bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Xu Jianguan in Yuanjiaham, outside the North Gate, holding rapid-firing guns. They swarmed into Xu's house, tied up Xu Jianguan, and beat him. They also lit torches and burned Xu Jianguan's legs, forcing him to reveal where he had hidden his silver. They looted 380 silver dollars in cash and countless gold ornaments and valuables. After the incident, they went to the home of Lu Siguan in Hujiaham, Houcun, and wantonly looted. Before leaving, they kidnapped a seven-year-old child. At the same time, at the home of Hua Chunpei in Gutali, south of the township, more than ten bandits arrived and looted cash, clothing, etc., worth about one hundred yuan. The Public Security Bureau reported that these thieves dared to gather accomplices and commit robberies and kidnappings at a place close to the city, which was extremely illegal. It has specially dispatched the director of the branch bureau to go to the countryside for an on-site inspection and ordered a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>The Case of a Judge Insulting a Reporter Escalates</h3>
<p>Fan Jiuzhi, the executive member of the Jiashan County Reporter Association and a reporter for the Jiashan Mingbao, was insulted in court by Judge Zhang Peilin while listening to a trial at the county local court on the 31st. He was searched and ordered to leave, causing public outrage among the entire county's reporter association. An emergency meeting was convened that night and three resolutions were reached: (1) It is recommended that the High Court request the establishment of a reporter's seat in the County Local Court; (2) The High Court is requested to severely correct Judge Zhang's insult to reporters; (3) All reporters in Shanghai and Hangzhou unanimously requested forceful assistance.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: National Products Exhibition Opens</h3>
<p>The preparation for the Hangzhou National Products Exhibition had been going on for many days. A total of more than 70 manufacturers from Shanghai and Hangzhou participated. The opening ceremony was held at the Yangbatou National Products Market at 1 p.m. yesterday (the 2nd). Xu Shiheng, the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, gave a speech.

<h3>Wang Jingwei Came to Shanghai Yesterday for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Met with a Group of Reporters and Released Important Remarks</p>
<p>The Japanese Requesting the Sorting Out of Old Debts Is Indeed the Case</p>
<p>That Night, He Took the Night Train with Zeng Zhongming and Returned to Beijing</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, took the night train from Beijing at 7:00 a.m. yesterday to seek medical treatment in Shanghai. His wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Tieci Zeng Zhongming also came with him. After getting off at Nanxiang, he went straight to his residence on Bushi Road to rest. He then asked Dr. Noel to diagnose his diabetes. At 5:30 p.m., he met with a group of reporters and released important remarks. He took the night train back to Beijing that night. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Came to Shanghai for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>According to Wang, the amount of sugar in his diabetes has suddenly increased recently, so he specially took the time to come to Shanghai to ask Dr. Noel to examine him. After arriving in Shanghai today, he has already been examined by Dr. Noel. This trip is entirely to examine his old illness and has no other task. He intends to return to Beijing immediately.</p>
<h3>Loan Inaccurate</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from TASS in this city, a group of international bankers recently came to Shanghai to study a plan for an international loan to China. Wang said that this statement is completely inaccurate. Russia is currently actively carrying out its five-year plan, so where would it have funds to invest? As for the international community, there is no such statement either.</p>
<h3>Sorting Out Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of sorting out foreign debt, when Mr. Song (Ziwen) was Acting President of the Executive Yuan on January 21st of last year, the United States requested us to sort out the Sino-American debt. Later, after the Japanese learned of this news, they asked our ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, to request the central government to sort out the old debts. Ambassador Jiang immediately telegraphed to report, but the Japanese have not yet proposed specific sorting out conditions and methods, so there is no way to proceed. Furthermore, our country's Ministry of Finance had long established a committee for sorting out domestic and foreign debts and is actively engaged in sorting them out.</p>
<h3>Central Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The exchange of notes between Japan and the United States this time should reduce the tension between Japan and Russia. Our country currently urgently needs to improve its internal affairs and prepare for the future. As for the diplomatic policy, there has been no change from beginning to end. Committee Member Huang Changgu Yingbai will go south to Jiangxi in the coming days to meet with Committee Member Chiang. It is rumored that Huang's visit this time will bring a plan to resolve the North China issue. Before meeting with Huang, I don't</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama's Entry into Tibet</h3>
<p>Regarding the Tibetan issue, Britain has already stated that it has no ambition to encroach upon Tibet. As for the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet, it is another matter. The Panchen Lama has a long history in Tibet. If the Tibetan people welcome the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet, the central government will do its best to assist him in returning. However, neither the central government nor the Panchen Lama intends to use force to escort him back. Mr. Huang Musong's inspection tour to Tibet is expected to take place in mid-April.</p>
<h3>Southwest Issues</h3>
<p>The issue of abolishing the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Southwest Executive Department has been discussed several times recently. However, Mr. Hu Zhantang has expressed opposition to this. Currently, it is still under negotiation. Mr. Hu Zhantang has not yet come to Nanjing. The central government still hopes that Mr. Hu will come to Nanjing as soon as possible. However, the rumor that Mr. Chiang Ting-wen's visit to Guangdong carries the mission of urging Mr. Hu to come to Nanjing is not confirmed.</p>
<h3>Gu Renfa Case</h3>
<p>The Gu Renfa case has now been accepted by the court. There are two opinions on this matter. One is to sympathize with Gu for reporting the crime of a relative. The other is to express disgust for Gu's bigamy. I will wait for the facts to be investigated before handling it.</p>
<h3>Ban Hong Incident</h3>
<p>On the Yunnan-Burma border, Xue Fucheng previously drew a yellow line as the boundary. According to this, (Ban Hong) is within the yellow line and is Chinese territory, while (Ban Nong) is outside the yellow line and is Burmese territory. Regarding this dispute, we believe it is in Ban Hong, while the British believe it is in Ban Nong. Therefore, it can only be resolved by both parties sending personnel to survey the boundary line. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already urged the embassy to handle negotiations in Beijing and sent personnel to Yunnan to assist the local government in surveying the boundary.</p>
<h3>Returning to Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang attended today's Executive Yuan meeting and returned to Beijing on the night train last night with Mr. Zeng Zhongming. Also on the same train were Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, President of the Judicial Yuan Ju Zheng, etc.</p>
<h3>Roger to Arrive in Shanghai on Schedule</h3>
<p>Sailing on the same ship as Ballard</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive on April 9th</p>
<p>According to the "Ta Mei Wan Pao," the American Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai received a telegram this morning stating that Dr. Roger, the expert sent by the US government to China to investigate the impact of the US Silver Purchase Act on China, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 9th. The ship he is traveling on is the "President Hoover." Mr. Ballard, a silver expert, is also on the same ship and will disembark in Japan.</p>
<h3>Li Jingcong Returns to Shanghai to Discuss</h3>
<p>Merger of Two Airline Offices</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, Li Jingcong, manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning. He told reporters that although the Peiping-Shaanxi route has been successfully test-flown, it is planned to open it simultaneously with the Guangdong-Shaanxi route. However, the Guangzhou airport on the Guangdong-Shaanxi route still needs to be negotiated with the Guangdong authorities, so the opening date has not been determined. The Northwest route has been suspended since the riots occurred in Xinjiang Province, and no telegrams of pacification have been received, so there is no timetable for resumption. As for the merger of the offices of the company and the China National Aviation Corporation, it only applies to the offices at various airport stations to save expenses, and there is no intention to merge the head office offices.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Flights Shorten Southbound Journey</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Implemented Starting Today</p>
<p>Flight Times Also Changed</p>
<p>The northbound flight on the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route originally flew to Shanghai every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, stopping in Xiamen on the same day and arriving in Shanghai the next day, which was inconvenient for passengers. Therefore, starting today, the flight time will be shortened to arrive on the same day to avoid delays in between, and the flight schedule will be revised. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Implemented Today</h3>
<p>The company has decided to change the northbound flight on the Shanghai-Guangdong route to arrive in Shanghai from Guangdong on the same day. Therefore, the flight schedule has been revised and will be implemented starting today. The southbound flight to Guangdong today will fly according to the new schedule. At the same time, the northbound flight schedule, which originally departed from Guangzhou every Wednesday and Saturday, stayed in Xiamen, and arrived in Shanghai the next day, will be changed to every Thursday and Sunday, flying directly from Guangdong to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Bring Your Own Food</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the company told the reporter of the Huadong News Agency yesterday that according to the company's regulations, passengers on the company's flights are not provided with food along the way. However, some passengers are negligent in this regard, and often do not prepare food when traveling, which causes passengers on long-distance flights to be hungry. Therefore, the company hopes that future passengers will bring their own food to satisfy their hunger.</p>

<h3>Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>The Pinghan Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company handled intermodal transport. Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the company, sent Zhou Fengtu, a commissioner of the Intermodal Transport Department, to Hankou. According to the outline for intermodal transport between state-owned railways and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, an intermodal cargo water-land transport contract was signed, and Hankou was designated as the connecting point. Freight rates and all intermodal transport methods have been decided. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on the first of this month. However, because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf in Hankou is far from the railway, transportation is quite inconvenient. Therefore, it was decided to repair and expand the original Pinghan Railway Bureau's wharf on the river bank that is connected to the railway in order to serve as an intermodal transport wharf. Now that the wharf has been completed, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially prepared a barge to install intermodal transport cargo. As for the date of implementation, it is expected to be implemented in May. After implementation, the original Hankou wharf of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be used as a non-intermodal transport wharf.</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>After the Jinpu Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company carried out intermodal transport, a draft intermodal cargo water-land transport contract was drafted. After being reviewed and approved by the Jinpu Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially sent a commissioner of the Intermodal Transport Department to Pukou last Thursday, and formally signed the contract with Chen Shungeng, the director of the Traffic Department of the Jinpu Railway, last Friday. It was stipulated that the intermodal delivery point would be Pukou, and all stations along the Jinpu Railway would be added to the intermodal transport. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is for the ports of Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River. Zhou Fengtu returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and reported the signing process to General Manager Liu Hongsheng yesterday, and the board of directors reported it to the Ministry of Communications. It is heard that the earliest date for implementation must be in May.</p>
<h3>Jinghu and Other Railways</h3>
<p>The Jinghu, Huhangyong railways and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company handled water-land cargo intermodal transport. Zheng Maizhao, director of the Traffic Department of the Railway Bureau, contacted Zhou Fengtu, the Intermodal Transport Department of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The intermodal transport contract has also been drafted and is planned to be signed. However, the progress of the intermodal transport contract was suspended due to the transfer of Director Zheng to the position of Deputy Director of the Beining Railway. However, other railways, such as the Ninglu, Zhengtai Road, Pingsui Road, Daoqing Road, and Xiang'e Road, are conducting intermodal transport with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company separately.</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan Passed Through Shanghai and Entered Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Minister of Justice Luo Wengan asked the government for leave to return to Guangdong to marry his daughter and inspect various judicial organs in the Southwest. Now that the matter is completed, he took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Guangdong to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Outsiders rarely know about this. After a brief rest in Shanghai, Mr. Luo took the early Jinghu train to Beijing yesterday morning at about 8:00 AM with his secretary and others to cancel his leave. It is heard that the issue of the abolition of the Supreme Court of the Southwest will be realized after Mr. Luo arrives in Beijing and consults on it.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Replied to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Government Has Not Reduced the Value of Currency</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously heard rumors that the government would depreciate the value of the currency, and was deeply afraid that the rumors would be spread and affect the market. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, made a statement declaring that there was no such thing. On the one hand, the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance asking it to clearly express its views in order to reassure the people. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the government had no intention of reducing the value of the currency. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are as follows:</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegram</h3>
<p>Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing, regards the rumors that the government will depreciate the national currency as causing abnormal panic among the people. The Chamber of Commerce has received inquiries from various industries, and it is obvious that speculators are deliberately creating rumors to confuse the audience in an attempt to disrupt the market. I have ordered them to feel at ease in their businesses and not to be alarmed. Since the abolition of taels in our country, the national currency law has just been established. At this time, the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the currency systems of the provinces have not yet been unified, the financial organization is not complete, and the financial foundation is not solid. How can we lightly follow the example of others and cause chaos, so that the whole country, from top to bottom, will not see its benefits, but will first suffer its harm. I know that the government has clear insight and knows the slightest details, and will not lightly change it. However, since there are rumors in the market, and it concerns the overall financial situation, the Chamber of Commerce dares not remain silent, and should ask the government to investigate the source of the rumors and declare it clearly in order to dispel the rumors and reassure the people. I hope for a reply by telegram. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the telegram has been received. The government has absolutely no intention of reducing the value of the currency. I hope that you will immediately inform all industries not to lightly believe the rumors and frighten themselves. The Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Jiangfeng Airplane Crashes in Wenzhou</h3>
<p>The Fuselage is Slightly Damaged and Xu Chengqi is Injured</p>
<p>The Naval Department Sends the Chutai Warship to Rescue</p>
<p>According to the Daily News Agency, the Jiangfeng seaplane, manufactured by the Aircraft Manufacturing Department of the Naval Department, was flown to Fuzhou by instructor Xu Chengqi the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it was mistakenly reported that the plane had reached Majiang (according to yesterday's newspaper, the draft was adopted by the Daily News Agency). It is now known that the plane suddenly had a mechanical failure on the way to Wenzhou and landed in Qilizhen. Instructor Xu was injured. The Naval Department heard the news and immediately sent the Chutai warship to rescue. The reporter of the Daily News Agency talked about the situation in detail with Zeng Yijing, director of the Aircraft Department, and is divided into the following sections:</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Accident</h3>
<p>According to Zeng, the Jiangfeng airplane departed from the Longhua Seaplane Airport at 9:30 AM the day before yesterday (the first day). At 1:05 PM, it was approaching Wenzhou when the engine suddenly encountered obstacles and could not move forward. Because it was not corrected in time, it was forced to land in Qilizhen near Wenzhou. The fuselage was slightly damaged. Instructor Xu Chengqi was injured due to the violent vibration when the plane crashed. He was immediately sent to Wenzhou Datong Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, two telegrams were received one after another, reporting the cause of the accident. They were both drafted by Xu, which shows that his injuries are not serious. It was also reported by Datong Hospital that Xu's injuries were very minor. There was no damage to his head or feet. However, the ribs were seriously injured and there was a risk of developing pleurisy. He is currently very awake and his fever has subsided. There is no danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Sending a Ship to Rescue</h3>
<p>When we received the telegram about the Jiangfeng accident, we immediately telegraphed the Naval Department to report it. Minister Chen (Shaokuan) immediately telegraphed the Chutai warship parked in Xiangshan Port to go to the rescue. The ship arrived in Wenzhou yesterday morning (the second day) on an accelerated schedule. There have been no telegrams reporting the detailed situation. It has been decided to send Wang Chonghong, an engineer from this office, by airplane to Wenzhou tomorrow morning (that is, this morning) to see how Xu Chengqi is injured. If it is very critical, another airplane will be sent to pick him up and return him to Shanghai for treatment. Otherwise, he will wait for him to return to Shanghai by the Chutai warship for medical treatment. The damaged Jiangfeng airplane is still in Qilizhen. Several workers were previously sent to prepare for repairs there, and they are now guarding it.</p>
<h3>Afghan, Bratov, Arrested</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Bratov, an Afghan who presides over the organization called the Great Asia Revival League in Japan, was instructed by the Japanese this time to transfer from Guangdong to Hong Kong and secretly come to Shanghai to prepare to recruit a large number of traitors, hooligans, etc. to Dalian to hold the so-called Asia National Congress, using the slogan of the national liberation movement to achieve its purpose of disturbing Chinese society. The local authorities of the Chinese Concession believed that the rogue's arrival in China was a security risk, so they arrested him at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday when a certain 輪 docked at the Nan City Wharf. He is still being detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. It is heard that Mr. Bratov did not carry an entry passport when he came to China this time. The Public Security Bureau has asked the Municipal Government for instructions on how to deal with this matter in the future.</p>

<p>Party and Government Agencies Send Personnel to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the customs clearance workers decided to declare a general strike yesterday morning due to the Tianjin Bang customs clearance firms' cancellation of the vehicle force case, which was decided by the general meeting of all members. Party and government agencies sent personnel to investigate the truth. The Customs Clearance Industry Association held an emergency meeting last night to discuss solutions. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>All the Yangbu department workers of the Tianjin Bang customs clearance firms declared a general strike yesterday morning due to their opposition to the cancellation of the vehicle force. The customs clearance firms involved in the strike are: (1) Sanyang Jingqiao Jiqingli Xinglin; (2) Jiangxi Road Guangdong Road Tongchenggong; (3) Yong'an Street Yonganfang Gongtai in the French Concession; (4) Dama Road Xiangxingli Yufengsheng; (5) Yong'an Street Litaichang; (6) Sanyang Jingqiao Taichangxiang, etc., totaling more than 180 workers. All the Tianjin cotton cloth exported yesterday on the Taikoo Company's Luzhou輪 and Dalian Company's Yijin丸 was completely stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Grouped Inspection</h3>
<p>After the Tianjin Bang workers declared a strike, they also appointed an inspection team of 64 people, divided into ten groups, to conduct inspections at various wharves, shipping companies, and factories. The groups are: the first group, various shipping companies, the Bund New Customs Wharf, Datong Wharf; the second group, Japanese-owned Nei Wai Mian No. 3 Factory; the third group, Nei Wai Mian No. 5 and No. 6 Factories, and Yitongxing; the fourth group, Japanese-owned Rihua Xihe Yarn Factory, British-owned Public Welfare Yarn Factory, Nei Wai Mian No. 1 Factory; the fifth group, Toyota Shenxin No. 1 Factory; the sixth group, Donghua, Shenxin No. 5 Factory; the seventh group, Japanese-owned Shanghai No. 4 and No. 5 Factories, Shenxin No. 6 Factory, Yongan No. 1 Factory; the eighth group, Shanghai No. 3 Factory, Waitongxing; the ninth group, Japanese-owned Dakang, Yufeng; the tenth group, Shenxin No. 7 Factory, Gongda No. 2 Factory, British-owned Jardine Matheson, and various wharves along the Huangpu River. The order was quite strict.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the representatives of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Long Peiyun, and the representatives of the three sections of the Social Bureau, Zhu Guilin, went to the Customs Clearance Industry Union in Panjia Lane, Lao Beimen, to investigate the strike situation, and then went to the Customs Clearance Industry Association on Tianzhutang Street to investigate, and urged the association to quickly find a way to stop it and maintain the original vehicle force of the workers to avoid expanding the dispute. Wang Yanling, the executive committee member of the association, accepted the advice of the party and government agencies and held a meeting to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Bilateral Conference</h3>
<p>The Association of Customs Brokers, in order to discuss solutions, specially convened an interim supervisory meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Chairman Shi Zhikun reported on the situation, and several solutions were immediately decided and submitted to Party and government organs for processing. The Customs Brokers' Trade Union, on the other hand, decided to hold a general meeting today at 2:00 PM to organize a strike committee responsible for handling strike matters.</p>
<h3>Reporting of the Circumstances</h3>
<p>A document from the Customs Brokers' Union to the Party and government organs stated: "We are submitting this to report that the Tianjin merchant capitalists are depriving workers of their benefits, only seeking their own enrichment, disregarding the lives of countless workers, daring to act improperly, and wantonly ruining them (above omitted). The origin of the said transportation fee is neither taken from the trade nor from the customers, but is entirely provided by the factory (the factory that produces the goods). The workers take it from the factory, so how can it harm the trade in the slightest? Previously, your association summoned both parties for questioning. The capitalists, knowing they were in the wrong, made excuses, saying that there are many Japanese customs brokers in Tianjin, and their shipping prices are cheaper than those of Chinese merchants. In order to compete for business, they resorted to this measure. Such arguments are even more absurd. Your association saw through their trickery and ordered the Association of Customs Brokers to take responsibility for handling it (middle omitted). Now, for the sake of safeguarding their own livelihood, the workers have passed a resolution in the general meeting to declare a strike until final victory. We earnestly request that you swiftly and severely punish the capitalists who are undermining the vehicle force, so as to relieve the people's suffering and prevent the expansion of disputes. We submit this with utmost urgency, awaiting your orders."</p>

<h3>Japanese Merchants Plot to Resume Upriver Navigation</h3>
<p>Japanese Economic Aggression</p>
<p>What are the Feelings of the Chinese People?</p>
<p>The increase in fares by the river steamer alliance has aroused opposition from the river transport guilds, leading to a halt in cargo handling and creating an opportunity for the smooth sale of Japanese goods upstream. Now, Japanese steamers are going a step further, plotting to resume upriver routes, from Hankou to Shashi and Yichang. The Nisshin Steamship Company has already dispatched the Shinyo Maru to resume navigation. It is currently undergoing major repairs in Shanghai, scheduled to sail for the first time on the 21st. The Japanese are meticulously planning to expand the market for Japanese goods and seize our country's shipping industry. What will the Chinese people's feelings be towards Japanese economic aggression?</p>
<h3>Artifacts Stored in Shanghai Not Inspected Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the artifacts from the Palace Museum stored in Shanghai were originally scheduled to be inspected yesterday morning by four representatives designated by the Municipal Party Department, as well as Section Chief Li Dachao of the Municipal Government, and nine inspectors designated by the Shanghai Office of the Palace Museum. However, the Municipal Government believed that the artifacts were numerous and that it was difficult for those without specialized knowledge of antiquities to distinguish their authenticity. Therefore, it was proposed to hire experts in the鑒别 of antiquities to jointly inspect the artifacts with the inspectors designated by various organs, in order to ascertain the authenticity of the artifacts. It is reported that experts in the鑒别 of antiquities are still being sought, so the inspection of the Palace Museum artifacts did not begin yesterday morning. It will begin on a scheduled date after the Municipal Government has hired experts.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Lessees Prepare to Organize the Lianyi Association</h3>
<p>Will Submit to Party and Government Organs for Filing</p>
<p>Declare That Lessees Have Heavy Responsibilities and Meager Profits</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, rickshaw lessees Yuan Guilin, Zhu Shuangxi, Jiang Fuying, Jin Xinglin, Chen Guigen, and others initiated the organization of the (Rickshaw Lessees Lianyi Association). A preparatory discussion meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Wang Qile, Shi Changyuan, Wang Zuohong, and fifteen others attended. Yuan Guilin was publicly elected as chairman. The following was discussed: (1) Soliciting members. It was resolved that the preparatory committee should solicit rickshaw lessees to join the association from various rickshaw companies. (2) Submitting to Party and government organs for filing. It was resolved that Yuan and Zhu should be responsible for handling the submission. (3) Announcing the lessee's declaration. It was resolved and passed. The general idea is that the rickshaw problem is not well understood by the outside world, and many people believe that the small bosses profit from it, which is not in line with the facts. It is conceivable that the rickshaw pullers come to Shanghai from the countryside because they are forced by economic problems and the need for food. If each rickshaw puller directly rented a rickshaw from the owner, they would have to pay a deposit of 15 to 30 yuan, pay the rent first, and then obtain a license before they could negotiate. How can the tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers in Shanghai pay this amount? Therefore, we and others, in view of this, lend the appropriate amount and contract for the rickshaws. If a rickshaw puller's daily fare is not enough to pay the rent, and they must fall short, we and others must not be shortchanged by the owner. Otherwise, the owner will immediately withhold the license, preventing us from operating. This is the fundamental problem and the hidden pain of us and others. As for the rickshaw pullers' daily toil, they are barely able to feed themselves. Whether they can find another place to live is also an extremely difficult problem. In order to take care of their lives, we and others not only lease rickshaws on their behalf, but also provide the utensils, stoves, electricity, and tap water they use every day, which is not easy. We ask ourselves whether we can treat the rickshaw pullers fairly. Please think carefully about whether the small bosses are simply reaping the benefits without taking responsibility. To put it bluntly, after paying the rickshaw owners who reap the benefits without taking responsibility, each rickshaw only earns two or three jiao per day. We can only narrow the scope and work hard. Moreover, the cost of living is very high now. Each rickshaw has two shifts, morning and evening, and there are about four or five people who take turns. How can this meager income meet the needs of so many people? It would be impossible without us and others sharing this heavy responsibility with the rickshaw pullers. Also, the inspection fee has always been managed by the rickshaw owners. Last year, due to the changes made by the rickshaw owners, this fee was mostly borne by the small bosses. If a rickshaw puller has an accident on the road, we and others are responsible. Whose harsh rule is this? Therefore, we are publishing this to clarify the situation. If there is even half a word that is false, please conduct an on-site investigation to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>At the Same Time, Petition the Social Affairs Bureau Again</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the strike of workers at 53 umbrella factories including Huali Time has been mediated by Party and government organs. The capitalists held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to announce the suspension of business from today. Details are recorded below.</p>

<h3>The Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau Prohibit Welcoming Gods and Offering Sacrifices</h3>
<p>It was previously rumored that residents of the South City in this city would hold a City God festival on Qingming Day. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, on the orders of the Municipal Government, stated that welcoming gods and offering sacrifices wastes people's wealth and promotes superstition, which is a prohibited practice. It should be investigated and dealt with according to the case. Yesterday, the two bureaus jointly issued a notice strictly prohibiting it, and the Public Security Bureau ordered its subordinates to prohibit it.</p>
<h3>The Widely Reported Case of Exhumation and Re-examination in Chongming Determines That It Was Definitely Suicide</h3>
<p>丨Re-examination Results from the Zhenru Forensic Institute丨</p>
<p>Qiu Yinxiang, the daughter of Qiu Chuanlang from Xin Kaihe Town, Chongming, married Yang Miaolang, who lived nearby. Due to discord between the two families, the young couple had a difficult time. After several storms and lawsuits, the young couple were reunited, and their love was crystallized. She was eight months pregnant. However, in May of last year, Qiu Yinxiang suddenly hanged herself. The manner of death was extremely tragic. After her death, Qiu Chuanlang filed a lawsuit with the county government, claiming that his daughter had been injured to death by Yang's mother and sister, and that the suicide was a cover-up. Yang, on the other hand, claimed that his wife's death was due to his father-in-law's insistence on preventing the couple from reuniting. She was held back and beaten, so she took her own life out of resentment. Therefore, his wife's death was actually caused by her father. After the county's examination, it was determined that she had committed suicide by hanging. Qiu Chuanlang was still unwilling and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The case was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Court for re-examination and investigation. Prosecutor Yang An summoned both parties and transported the body and coffin to Shanghai, sending them to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for exhumation and examination. As there were no external injuries, internal organs were taken and subjected to a lengthy chemical examination, as well as bone steaming and examination. The chemical examination results from the previous day still showed no injuries and confirmed that she had committed suicide by hanging. Therefore, a diagnosis was prepared and sent to the court. After the prosecutor opened the court and questioned them, they were ordered to leave. Therefore, the widely reported case of exhumation and re-examination in Chongming has come to an end.</p>
<h3>A Large Group of Hoodlums Causes a Great Disturbance at the Republic Theater</h3>
<p>Where Was Pan Guoliang Taken?</p>
<p>Trouble Arises from Watching a Free Show</p>
<p>The Republic Theater, located at Xiaocai Chang, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, was showing "Fen Zhuang Lou" on stage from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM the day before yesterday. As the audience was enjoying the performance, a hoodlum named Miao Chunshan forcibly entered without buying a ticket, leading to a conflict and subsequent scuffle with ticket collector Chen Zhaoxin. Someone reported the incident to police officer Ning Zhenying from the 14th Precinct of the 4th District Public Security Bureau, who took Miao to the district office. Unexpectedly, a large group of hoodlums, some of whom were armed soldiers, arrived shortly afterward. Without asking for any explanation, they started beating people indiscriminately, causing chaos. Audience members fled in panic, and chairs, tables, teapots, and teacups flew everywhere. It is said that the theater owner, Pan Guoliang, was dragged away, and his whereabouts are unknown. Later, Pan's wife, Ms. Gu, and ticket collector Chen Zhaoxin reported the incident to the 4th District. Officer Zheng of the district conducted an inquiry. According to Ms. Gu, 42 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 36 Youyuli, Gonghe Road, her livelihood depended on the theater. Today, Miao Chunshan, accompanied by a soldier from a security force, came to watch a free show. The ticket collector argued with them, and Miao and the soldier beat him. After Miao was taken to the district office, the security force arrived, beat her husband, and dragged him away. His whereabouts are now unknown, she stated. Chen Zhaoxin, 19 years old, from the same hometown as Ms. Gu, and also residing in Youyuli, provided a similar account. Miao Chunshan claimed to be 27 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 28 Jiaotong Road, and working as a copper smith at the tram company. He claimed he bought a ticket to watch the show, but it was lost during the fight. His other statements were evasive. After reviewing the statements, the investigating officer noted that since Pan Guoliang was dragged away by soldiers from a security force, the specific unit and division should be investigated immediately and reported to the security force for further investigation. However, since Miao Chunshan entered without a ticket and assaulted the ticket collector, his case was transferred to the Zhabei branch of the 3rd Section of the Public Security Bureau for further action. According to theater staff, the hoodlums damaged equipment worth approximately five or six hundred yuan.</p>

<h3>Local National Product Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Today's Banquet for Shen Honglie</p>
<p>Last autumn, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' National Product Promotion Association, and the China National Product Maintenance Association led Shanghai national product manufacturers to participate in the 4th Qingdao National Product Exhibition. The exhibition lasted three weeks, with total sales reaching 500,000 yuan, a very good result. This was all thanks to the strong promotion by Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie. The manufacturers deeply appreciated his efforts. Recently, Mayor Shen traveled from Hangzhou to Shanghai to visit famous local national product factories to promote the revitalization of industry and national products in Qingdao. Therefore, the Citizens' National Product Promotion Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday to arrange a welcome banquet to show their hospitality.

Therefore, it was decided to join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's group banquet at 6:00 PM on the 3rd (today) in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Building to express their respect.</p>
<h3>Municipal Citizens' National Product Association Prepares for Changsha National Product Exhibition</h3>

Details can be obtained at the office in Wenmiao Park.</p>
<h3>High Quality of Chinese Cement</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, recent news from the Shanghai construction industry indicates that Japanese cement is a major import to China. Recently, Japanese companies, noting the decline in Chinese resistance to foreign goods, have been importing large quantities of cement on Japanese ships. In addition to supplying Japanese yarn mills and other factories for expansion, they are also offering lower prices to foreign merchants. However, Shanghai Qixin and other Chinese cement factories are striving for excellence in terms of quality and color. Therefore, their sales are still quite strong, and their business is thriving. However, to prevent the mixing of Japanese goods, buyers are advised to pay attention to the brand names.</p>
<h3>Robbers in Changan Lane Sentenced</h3>
<p>Robbers Yu Qianxing from Ningbo and Zhu Jinsheng, a local, were sentenced for robbing the home of Ms. Lu Jiang, a local woman residing at No. 34, Lane 563, Changan Lane, Yangshupu Road, at around 5:00 AM on July 10th last year. They and their accomplices used weapons and stole several tens of yuan worth of valuables before fleeing. The case was solved on the 23rd of last month when Chinese detective Su Changsheng of the Yulin Road Police Station apprehended them. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and trial. The court yesterday handed down the sentence in the Third Criminal Court. Yu Qianxing was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Zhu Jinsheng was sentenced to two years and ten months. The number of days detained before the judgment was finalized will be deducted from the sentence, with two days of detention equivalent to one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Heads of Accounting Departments on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Hallis Resigns and Returns Home</p>
<p>Rankester Succeeds to the Vacancy</p>
<p>Mr. Hallis, the head of the accounting department of the Railway Bureau, has resigned due to old age and returned to his home country. He has been reassigned as a commissioner. Mr. Rankester has succeeded him in the vacancy.

At the same time, they held a reception for the newly appointed secretary, Liu Dingxin, introducing him to the heads of various departments. They also took a group photo on the rooftop garden as a memento.</p>
<h3>Monk Yuanying Receives Order to Take Over Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>Confirmed That the Temple Belongs to the Public Monastery</p>
<p>Decided That Yuanying Will Serve as the Abbot</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, Zhiwen, had previously been reported to have privately mortgaged temple property. The central government repeatedly ordered the municipal government to appoint impartial individuals to form a committee to investigate the temple's property. The municipal government has also announced to the public not to purchase Jing'an Temple property to avoid inconvenience. Abbot Zhiwen has long argued about the history of the temple, disputing whether it belonged to the discipleship school or the public monastery school. However, the authorities have now confirmed that the temple is indeed a public monastery. Representatives of the monastery have selected Yuanying as the new abbot of Jing'an Temple. Fearing that Abbot Zhiwen would resist the handover and secretly sell temple property, the municipal government has ordered the relevant authorities to strictly prohibit this. At the same time, the Buddhist Association has been ordered to inform the new abbot, Yuanying, to prepare to take over as soon as possible. It is reported that the new abbot Yuanying is preparing to take over.</p>
<p>Preparation Banquet for the Construction of the Puyi Cemetery</p>
<p>The Pushan Villa has been providing burials for exposed corpses, distributing coffins, and providing medicine for over twenty years. They have been dedicated to their work, leaving no stone unturned. They have collected and buried over 70,000 exposed corpses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, contributing to public health in those areas. They have long been praised by local people. However, as their operations have expanded, their finances have become increasingly strained. The day before yesterday, they held a banquet at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant, attended by Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Yuan Ludeng, 蕢延芳, Pang Zhuqing, Zhao Wenhuan, Luo Kunxiang, Wu Zhiping, Shi Gengyin, Lao Bianbao, Chen Liangyu, Wang Junsheng, and others to discuss the construction of the Puyi Cemetery. Previously, Mr. Liu Ranqing, deeply understanding the financial difficulties of the villa, generously donated over fifty mu of farmland he owned along the Zhenda Road in Dachangzhen for the construction of the cemetery. All income generated from the land would be used to support the villa's expenses. However, while the land for the cemetery is available, funding is needed for construction. The question of how to raise these funds was brought up for discussion. After deliberation, the attendees unanimously agreed that since the cemetery meets a social need and maintains a charitable cause, serving multiple benefits at once, Yuan Ludeng and 蕢延芳 proposed a plan to invite enthusiastic philanthropists to pledge to donate certain amounts to facilitate the process. The proposal was approved by everyone, and it was also suggested to stage charity performances, inviting famous actors and opera singers to perform. There is no shortage of charitable people in Shanghai, and it is believed that ticket sales will be enthusiastic at that time.</p>
<h3>Sheng Zhiren Discusses Labor-Capital Dispute in the Umbrella Industry</h3>
<p>Sheng Zhiren, manager of the Zhonghua National Products Umbrella Business Office, discussed the recent labor-capital dispute in the umbrella industry, which he considered unfortunate. Although he represents the capital side, he wished to offer an impartial opinion to the public. (1) Although most capitalists are small-scale, they can abandon their individual views and unite to enthusiastically promote national product raw materials, conscientiously manufacture products, and reasonably increase selling prices, which may not be without solutions. (2) Currently, many produce shoddy goods, attempting to reduce costs by using raw materials from the East, and they treat workers poorly. Therefore, although the selling price is low, the goods are not durable, only creating competition among the capitalists themselves. (3) Workers' compensation is indeed too low. It is hoped that party and government agencies will impartially mediate the situation and prevent both sides from going to extremes. It should be stated that the business office I run always uses domestic raw materials and treats employees relatively well. Therefore, the relationship is very harmonious. This is not self-praise; there are facts to prove it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Dental Association to Hold Second Lecture Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Dental Association has been holding lectures since February, which have been well-received by the dental community. It is scheduled to hold its second lecture tonight at 7:30 PM at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge. Professor Xu Junmin of the Shanghai Dental College will be the speaker, and the topic will be "Accidental Complications Encountered in Dental Clinical Practice and Their Treatment." The content will include various important issues such as shock before and after surgery, fainting, bleeding, and dislocation. All members of the dental community are welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>Deng Cigan, Involved in Roulette Gambling Den Case, Remains at Large</h3>
<p>Deng Has Fled to Hong Kong, Case Not Yet Heard</p>
<p>The Russian Yao Kesutu, formerly pretending to be a Brazilian national, leased a large building from the British company Taili Yangxing on Avenue Edward VII to open a roulette gambling den. The General Inspectorate learned of this and sent Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest the Russian, who was then handed over to the First Special District Court for trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of three thousand yuan. It is now known that a Cantonese man named Deng Cigan was also involved with the Russian. However, Deng fled when the gambling den was raided. The police have filed a public prosecution against Deng. The First Special Court recently issued a summons for trial, but Deng did not surrender. Wu Saitai, a lawyer, appeared in court and claimed that Deng had gone to Hong Kong, requesting a postponement. Therefore, the case was not heard. The judge approved a postponement for the trial.</p>
<h3>Contributions of the China Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>"Parents' Studies" Has Been Published</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, as the promoter of Children's Day in China, has specially published the book "Parents' Studies" (Modern Parents' Series) during this year's nationwide celebration of Children's Day, for the use of those who promote or study parental education throughout China. This is a memorable event. It is reported that the book was written by Professor Ailide, a professor of child psychology at St. Xingnaide University in the United States. It provides detailed and insightful discussions and insights into various issues faced by modern parents and has long been renowned in Europe and the United States, widely read and memorized, and is a valuable resource for promoting parental education. Chinese child education expert Mr. Chen Heqin praised the book as (1) having a scientific basis, (2) having revolutionary suggestions, (3) having appropriate and rich examples. Its value can be seen. The entire book is divided into sixteen chapters, written in a lively and interesting style. During this nationwide celebration of Children's Day and promotion of children's well-being, all parents, those preparing to become parents, and all school teachers should read a copy. The actual price per copy is six jiao.</p>

At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, he led Russian detectives to search the address. They found six Russians, Cheernastinsky, Wudiyaguf, Xinaniguf, Weituoliaifu, Zhilinggisky, and Shaliuquanna, sitting in a room smoking these cigarettes.

<h3>Laborer Dies from Crushed Spine</h3>
<p>Liu A'san, a 34-year-old laborer from Jiangbei, was employed at the Yan Zhenhe bridal shop in Huacao Xiaoyangbang, West Shanghai. He was usually very diligent in his duties. The day before yesterday afternoon, Liu was making woodenware in the shop and went to the area where wood was piled by the river to carry a large piece of wood on his shoulder. Unexpectedly, he was too weak to bear the weight and was pressed down. The wood crushed his spine, causing him to fall to the ground and vomit blood, dying instantly. His fellow laborers were shocked and immediately tried to rescue him, but they were unable to do anything. The incident was discovered by the First Precinct of the Sixth District. In addition to sending police to summon the shop owner for investigation, the head of the 37th Bao, 5th Tu, Chen Yuetang, was ordered to report the case to the local court for verification. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Yang and others arrived at the scene to verify the cause of death. It was confirmed that the death was caused by crushing. The shop was instructed to handle the funeral arrangements, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>News on the Zhang Zhiyun Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiyun, who was once elected as the first "Movie Queen," filed a criminal complaint against Zhou Xiaobo, accusing him of violating their cohabitation agreement. She retained lawyer Dan Yuhua to prosecute Zhou for offenses against public morals. The First Special District Court opened the trial twice, but neither party appeared. Zhang Zhiyun even submitted a petition to the court, denying that she had accused Zhou and requesting a thorough investigation. The matter is so confusing that outsiders cannot understand the truth, and the court is almost lost in a fog. They will investigate thoroughly. It was learned from a certain source that Zhang Zhiyun personally visited the court on the afternoon of the 30th of last month. However, the trial had already concluded when she arrived, so Zhang did not go to the Eighth Tribunal and returned home. Afterwards, Zhang told people that she would definitely surrender at the next hearing, explain the entire process of the dispute with Zhou, and dispel all kinds of doubts. If so, the case may move from a situation of confusion to one of clarity.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Farmers Bank to Relieve the Rural Economy of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Expanding the Northern Jiangsu Farmers Bank</p>
<p>Promoting Cooperative Organizations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, as the sole institution for relieving rural finance in the province, has been established for five years. Over the years, its business has progressed. Since the reorganization of the bank in January of this year, its operations have developed rapidly, with many reforms, and its business has shown a rapid leap forward compared to before. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, the bank is becoming more and more valued. The reporter, based on investigations from various aspects, now selects and records the recent handling of the bank as follows:</p>
<p>In the past years, it has been found that the bank's capital is 2.6 million yuan, and there are already 24 branches.</p>
<p>Development Status According to the bank's report, as of March 15th this year, all loans, deposits, and collections have made significant progress. The savings and deposit items alone increased by more than 900,000 yuan in two and a half months, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in the bank's history.</p>
<p>Recruiting Talents The Farmers Bank is a bank of a special nature, and its operating methods and internal affairs are not</p>
<p>Calculating Talents Without specialized talent, it is not enough to be competent. The bank's general manager, Mr. Zhao Dihua, was originally a financial and accounting expert, formerly the chief accountant of the National Government's Accounting Office and the deputy director of the Accounting Bureau, and a professor of accounting at various universities for many years. This time, in charge of the Farmers Bank, in addition to seeking to expand branches externally, expand business, and promote cooperative undertakings, he also pays attention to the improvement of internal work systems and the recruitment of specialized talents. Those who are recruited are mostly in their original positions and are being extended an invitation through the bank's efforts. Recently, the bank urgently needs to improve the accounting system, and the existing accounting talent is insufficient to allocate, so it used examination methods to select specialized talent.</p>
<p>Promoting Agriculture Because the bank feels that its business center is in loans and organized agricultural production cooperatives, but Jiangsu's cooperatives often only have a nominal reputation and rarely have practical effects. It has now sent many experts to various places to actively reorganize and promote various cooperatives so that they can also engage in production, transportation, sales, purchasing, utilization, and other businesses, so as to actually promote agricultural production.</p>
<p>Relieving the Northern To expand the practical effect of rescuing farmers (especially farmers in Northern Jiangsu)</p>
<p>Jiangsu Countryside, the bank is actively and tirelessly progressing in the establishment of branches. In addition to the Yixing branch, which will soon open, the Jinshan sub-branch is currently in preparation, and the Jintan business office has been expanded into a branch. It is said that in the future, it will focus its efforts on the promotion of branches in Northern Jiangsu, such as Qingpu, Suqian, Suining, and Donghai. The bank is planning separately to set up branches immediately. Recently, it was also heard that the bank has joined the Construction Department and the Education Department to convene a discussion meeting on the unified cooperative business in Northern Jiangsu, in order to actually relieve the rural economy in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Lu Xungong's Coffin Postponed for Shipment to Shanghai for Burial</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Xungong, a pioneer of the Chinese revolution, passed away due to heart disease at his residence in Beiping on June 12th last year. At that time, because the Japanese invaders were in North China, and Peiping and Tianjin were in imminent danger, his family, in order to admire the late person's long-cherished ambition of worrying about the country and forgetting personal matters, did not announce the news to relatives and friends, so few people outside knew about it. Now his family has decided to receive the post in Peiping on March 29th, and originally planned to transport the coffin to Shanghai on March 31st and bury it on April 3rd. Now, due to circumstances, it has been changed to April 2nd, to transport the coffin from Peiping to Shanghai, and it will be shipped from the North Station at 1:00 pm on April 3rd, and buried in the Public Works Department Cemetery on Hongqiao Road at 3:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Self-accusation Deemed Unsuitable, Public Prosecution Filed Instead, Resulting in the Acquittal of the Defendants</h3>
<p>Wu Suzhen, a woman from Changzhou, is 33 years old this year. She was already married and had a family in her hometown. She came to Shanghai in October of last year and met Zhang Huafu from Nanjing, Shen Meiying, a woman from Wuxi, and Wang Changfa, who is now at large. The three of them invited her to the Empire Theater in the French Concession to watch a movie. It happened that Chen Jinding, the owner of a flower shop at No. 45 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession (45 years old this year), was also watching the movie in the theater. After the show, because Chen was acquainted with Zhang and others, he invited Wu Suzhen, Zhang, and others to open a room at the Tiansheng Hotel in Baxianqiao to have some refreshments. Zhang, Shen, and Wang told Wu that Chen's wife had passed away and he urgently needed to remarry, using their eloquent tongues to broker the match. Suzhen was temporarily bewitched and became drunk from the wine. That night, she was raped by Chen, and her heart was swayed, and she was willing to marry Chen. After another round of persuasion from Zhang and others, Suzhen returned to her hometown to divorce her former husband. At the same time, on the 28th of that month, she and Chen held a wedding ceremony at the Hexinglou restaurant on Aiduya Road and Chengdu Road. After inviting guests, Suzhen lived at Chen's place. A few days later, she accompanied Chen back to his home in Dachang, and saw that Chen's wife was alive and well, and had a son and a daughter. Suzhen was greatly shocked, and argued with Chen to no avail, and immediately returned to Shanghai and went back to Changzhou, and told her mother, Wu Zhang, who came to Shanghai together. Zhang, as the legal representative, and Suzhen jointly hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Jinding, Zhang Huafu, Shen Meiying, and others of colluding to commit bigamy, requesting an investigation and prosecution, and attaching a civil suit to recover losses. The court summoned them based on the complaint. The details have been recorded in this newspaper last year. Subsequently, after trial, it was found that Wu Suzhen had gone through a marriage ceremony with Chen Jinding and was a spouse, which was not in accordance with the self-accusation procedure, so the self-accusation was ruled inadmissible. Wu Suzhen was unwilling to accept this, and submitted marriage certificates, gift books, invitation cards, and other evidence, and reported to the French police, requesting the initiation of a public prosecution according to law. The police chief immediately sent Detective Qian Yumin to arrest Chen Jinding, Zhang Huafu, Shen Meiying, and others. Wang Changfa was at large and could not be arrested. Then the police transferred Chen and the others to the Second Special District Court, and initiated a public prosecution on charges of bigamy. The details were also briefly recorded in the previous newspaper. During the trial, Chen Jinding confessed that he and the plaintiff Wu Suzhen had a relationship, but he did not marry her as a concubine. All the marriage certificates, etc., were written by Suzhen's brother. I am illiterate and do not know about this plan of framing me, and I was really fooled. Zhang Huafu, Shen Meiying, and others also denied being matchmakers, only introducing them to have an affair. After Judge Tu Shenjie opened court several times to summon witnesses, the result of the trial was that the evidence and reasons presented by the plaintiff were insufficient, and the defendants were acquitted the day before yesterday. During the appeal period, the defendants were all released on bail pending further instruction.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand People Compete to See the Big Wax Candles</h3>
<p>Yangjiazhai Supported About 400 Jin</p>
<p>The Pengchang Temple in the east end of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, initiated by the villagers, held a three-day victory meeting from March 31st to April 2nd to erect tower lamp poles. There were a total of 42 tower lamp poles erected on the open space of the temple fair. At about 6:00 pm in the evening, each lamp pole was lit, the red candles were shining brightly, which was quite spectacular. At the same time, the sound of firecrackers was deafening, and the large wax candles lit in front of the gods in the temple were no less than two hundred pairs. Among them, the ones supported by Yangjiazhai were the largest, about 400 jin. Therefore, the red men and women who came to watch from the four villages were extremely crowded, almost like on Shanyin Road, which was a grand occasion unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Impersonating A Police Officer, Search of the Red Pill Dealer Exposed</h3>
<p>Hu Yaohua Arrested at the Door</p>
<p>Zhang Jude's firewood and charcoal store on Xiaojiuhua Road in Nanshi also operates a rice and grain business, specializing in wholesale business in this port, which is very large. It has been open for more than ten years. Chen Meisheng, the manager, was closing the shop at about 6:00 pm the other day when four plainclothes men suddenly came to the store and claimed, "We are sent by the Public Security Bureau. Someone reported to the bureau that there are privately hidden red pills and contraband items here. The bureau sent us to search." They presented a search warrant for inspection. The store claimed that there were no contraband items hidden and, seeing that there was a search warrant from the bureau, allowed the search. After about two hours, they found nothing and left. The store felt aggrieved for being framed and immediately reported to the Firewood and Charcoal Guild, and sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting a thorough investigation of the person who framed them and to punish them. The Municipal Public Security Bureau specially sent Inspector Li to the store the other day to investigate, saying that the Public Security Bureau had not sent anyone to search, which was obviously someone impersonating them to seek extortion. The bureau is now investigating and punishing them. Suddenly, the day before yesterday afternoon, one of the people who searched the store passed by the door and was seen by a friend of the store, who stepped forward and arrested him, and called the police to detain him at the first branch of the first district. When questioned, he said his name was Hu Yaohua, and he lived in Dadongmen. He used to work at the Public Security Bureau. He confessed to searching the store and was immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

Two robbers held guns and monitored the actions of everyone in the store, and then began to search. They robbed a gold ring, more than 20 yuan in cash from Liao's pocket, and more than 100 jiao in double coins from the counter. They took the stolen goods and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the store reported to the police station requesting a pursuit.</p>

<h3>The 96 Public Bonds Have Renewed Vitality</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of public bonds have risen across the board, creating the highest record since the Shanghai War. This is not only due to the solidity of the various bodies' own funds and the accuracy of the successive repayments of principal and interest. Since the central government settled down after hearing of the changes, the financial aspect, under the overall planning, has been able to have a monthly surplus. As the news spread, financial circles and general speculators have been absorbing as much as possible, and the bond prices have gradually soared due to the relationship between supply and demand. The long-depressed 96 public bonds have shown a particularly active trend. It is heard that if the finances are slightly surplus, in order to care for the people, the Ministry of Finance can properly plan and start to sort things out, or it may be discussed at this financial meeting. At the same time, it is also heard that a general association of holders of these bonds has been formed, and they will also unanimously appeal at this financial meeting to urge the government to implement it as soon as possible. Then the reorganization of these public bonds should be seen in fact recently.</p>

<p>Small Preface A reader from this port came to visit our Club. As soon as we met, we asked him for criticisms of the work of reading guidance. He said: "A criticism is not good, but how can the (Reading Q&amp;A) be made interesting for ordinary shop assistants and apprentices to read?" So we asked him, "How many people are there in your shop? How many people are happy to read (Reading Q&amp;A)?" He laughed and said, "There are more than 160 people in the shop, including senior staff, and only 30 to 40 people like to read (Reading Q&amp;A). And among these 30 to 40 people, only seven or eight people really understand it!" After hearing this, we were both happy that our work could win the sympathy of a quarter of the 160 people, and naturally fearful and ashamed. It turned out that our work was so impractical. This is a clear criticism of our work, and it is extremely fair. A certain gentleman's trainee, who himself cannot fully understand everything discussed in (Reading Q&amp;A), and the few words he said, we consider them extremely valuable. We really need to hear the opinions of our basic readers themselves. Therefore, we have no choice but to make the following efforts for the (Reading Q&amp;A) in the future: First, for ourselves: (1) In terms of writing expression, we will try as much as possible to be popular so that it is not difficult to read, (2) We will try to avoid theoretical discussions that are too far away from general life, (3) We will use more practical examples to explain theories and talk less about principles. Second, for readers, we also have the following hopes: (1) (Reading Q&amp;A) is not necessarily that we talk too deeply, but the attitude of (Reading Q&amp;A) is more serious than that of general tabloids. Its content is theoretical exploration. We hope that people who are already interested in (Reading Q&amp;A) will often entice those who are still infatuated with low-level interest reading materials to come and see (Reading Q&amp;A.) (2) For (new nouns), (terms), and (theories themselves), I hope readers will try their best to absorb, learn hard, and not be too afraid of difficulties or too conservative. These (new nouns) and (terms) are all generated in modern daily life. If we want to be modern people, we really have no way to avoid using them, and we must be able to understand these things to read modern newspapers and books. (3) As for the content, we cannot lower it to cater to the level of low-level interests. We ask the readers to (catch up) and not (give up) if they cannot catch up. At the same time, we also hope that readers can specifically point out the errors in (Reading Q&amp;A).</p>
<p>Weekly Information (1) Ten reading comrades participated this week, including one female comrade. (2) Received 67 letters for discussion and replied to 42 letters. (3) Received ten letters requesting the organization of reading groups and six letters transferred by the postal lending department requesting the library to publish a regular publication. Five people came to talk. (4) This department decided: A Conduct a survey of readers' reading life for three months since the commencement of the reading guidance. The survey form will be sent out before the 10th. B For readers of this newspaper from other ports who have participated in the Reading Guidance Department for one month, if they are really interested in research and continue to communicate and discuss, and submit reading reports to this department, this department can introduce the postal lending department of this library to enjoy the right to borrow books, but the procedures will be determined separately. C All questions that are not within the scope of the department's answers, such as requests to introduce occupations, inquiries about school secrets, introductions to Western books and newspapers, suggestions to this newspaper, and questions that are too specialized (such as inquiries about the installation of spinning machines and the breeding of goldfish), will not be answered in the future. D (Reading Q&amp;A) will be published as usual during the spring break.</p>
<p>Mailbox (1) To readers of this department: (1) Please fill out the Reading Life Survey Form of this department for three months before April 15 and send it to the library. If you have not communicated with this department for a long time, please also explain the reason for not communicating for a long time. Those who do not send the reply letter to the library before the 30th will be deemed to have voluntarily withdrawn from this department, and the registration will be cancelled immediately. (2) You can use (1), (2), (3), etc. to mark the questions raised in the letter, and do not use polite words at all; for questions of different nature, please raise them twice. (3) Please do not raise questions that are too empty and have no content. It is best to raise them specifically based on a certain book or a certain newspaper. (2) To readers of Shen Bao: (1) All communications between readers of Shen Bao and this department are valid only if they have a communication stamp (that is, the one attached to the title of (Reading Q&amp;A) every day); those without stamps will not be answered. (2) Please pay attention to the second and third regulations of (To readers of this department) when asking questions. (3) Please conduct a survey of the number of people around you who read (Reading Q&amp;A) and their opinions on (Reading Q&amp;A).</p>

<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>I am not very clear about the situation elsewhere. In Shanghai, no matter who it is, when (Jiangbei people) are mentioned, they will pull down the corners of their mouths and sink their eyes, (humph)ing in their noses, expressing a hundred and twenty points of disdain.</p>
<p>Indeed, the position of (Jiangbei people) in Shanghai is like that of (Chinese) in the eyes of Europeans and Americans, a semi-civilized nation.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, in addition to (foreigners), (Ningbo people), (Guangdong people), and (Jiangbei people) stand as a tripod, supporting the market of Greater Shanghai. However, (Jiangbei people) are ultimately not as popular as (Ningbo people) and (Guangdong people). It is said that most (Jiangbei people) are engaged in humble occupations and rarely have (Kang Bai Du)-style high-class Chinese. This is the first level. The second level is that (Jiangbei people) lack mutual assistance and unity, and do not seek revenge when wronged. Another reason is that during the Battle of Shanghai, there was a traitor headquarters in Zhabei: the (Jiangbei Headquarters).</p>
<p>Regarding the first level, I think the thinking is already outdated. (Jiangbei people) exchange labor for bread, I ask, what are they ashamed of to heaven or to earth? The second level is indeed very meaningful, and it is precisely this that plagues the common disease of the (Chinese). As for the last level, it is simply an insult to the entire (Jiangbei people), because how could the former senior officials of the (Jiangbei Headquarters) be (Jiangbei people)?</p>
<p>Although the author grew up in Jiangnan, she lived in Jiangbei for more than ten years, so she is extremely aware that (Jiangbei people) are more accustomed to diligence and hard work than people in any other place, and are honest and loyal in nature. And I feel extremely unfair about the position of (Jiangbei people) in Shanghai. I hope that in the near future, in Shanghai, (Jiangbei people) will spontaneously rise up to establish (Jiangbei Bank), (Jiangbei Hotel), (Jiangbei University), and (Jiangbei Dance Hall). Then build a (Jiangbei Building) and organize a (Jiangbei Fellow Association), showing the (Jiangbei people)'s face all at once.</p>
<h3>Believe it or not?</h3>

<p>Starting from the last column of a thirteen-column abacus, push the beads up one by one, carrying one for every ten. When will it be possible to fill these beads? Eating, going out, and sleeping – the three major events are not counted; it will take until the thirty-first century!</p>
<p>If everyone continuously has four sons and none of them die young (they can only die after they have finished having children), in two hundred years, a small city of children can be created, with a total population of 262,144 children. (Assuming childbearing starts at age twenty-two.)</p>
<h3>Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Wofo</p>
<p>The tram was running along the tracks like clouds, and the seats on both sides of the car were crowded. The ticket seller seemed to be still free, looking at the few tickets folded up on his ticket tray for a while, and then shifting his gaze from horizontal to vertical, shooting it outside the window. A few passengers were also voluntarily paying attention for the ticket seller (Here! A foreigner!) A young passenger shouted this very quickly. Before the tram arrived at X station, a foreigner did jump on the tram, but the ticket seller’s few folded tickets had disappeared. While the foreigner was checking the tickets one by one, a tense atmosphere appeared in the quiet air, and the ticket seller's face was occasionally cast with glances.</p>
<p>(Here! A foreigner!) A vendor who was the first to shoulder his orange load and hurried into the alley to hide gave a warning to the other vendors as he got up. Their [the vendors'] senses are truly sharp. In the blink of an eye, the baskets, bamboo baskets, trays... had all disappeared, and only a few heads were sticking out from the nearby alleys. (He's gone, the foreigner!) Under the cheering of most people [vendors], the baskets, loads, bamboo baskets, trays... reappeared, connecting seamlessly.</p>
<p>Mr. X was hosting a dinner party at his house. After drinking, in addition to setting up a mahjong table, there was also a pai gow table. Everyone was smiling as they gambled, and there were also onlookers. (Here! A foreigner!) Although everyone didn't know where the shout came from, they hurriedly pushed the pai gow under the table without thinking or hesitating, and people also scurried aimlessly into several pigeonhole-like rooms. After a while of silence, everyone suddenly burst out laughing, with scolding mixed in the laughter. It turned out that it was a child from the neighbor's house who had lied.</p>
<p>(Here! A foreigner!) You can often hear this shout when you walk on the road, but I don't know who taught him [the foreigner] to come??</p>

<h3>Ten Commandments of Smoking</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>Smoking is originally harmful to the brain and stomach, but it also has the effect of avoiding plague and eliminating filth. However, if an addict suddenly quits, it is easy to contract a virus. Now, to prevent nicotine poisoning, there are ten key points that smokers should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>1.  Dry tobacco, moldy tobacco, and damp, old tobacco. Because nicotine is easily liberated, it is easy to be poisoned when smoking.</p>
<p>2.  Once a cigarette is smoked halfway and the flame goes out, do not smoke it again. If you want to smoke it, finish it, or discard it. Because when a cigarette is smoked halfway and goes out, nicotine condenses in the ashes, and this nicotine poison is very potent.</p>
<p>3.  When lighting a cigarette, never inhale the green smoke emitted from matches. Whenever a match is struck and lit, do not rush to light the cigarette, lest phosphorus poison enter the mouth.</p>
<p>4.  When inhaling smoke, be sure to keep your mouth closed and exhale through your nostrils, because smoke entering the nose is most likely to damage the brain.</p>
<p>5.  Cigar tobacco has the most nicotine, so it should be avoided. If you are heavily addicted to tobacco, it should be smoked in a long pipe for safety.</p>
<p>6.  Smoking after eating or on an empty stomach is not appropriate; smoking while drinking is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>7.  Do not smoke when angry or unhappy, because your mind, whether excited or depressed, is easily poisoned by nicotine.</p>
<p>8.  When smoking various cigarettes, a long cigarette holder should be used so that nicotine accumulates in the cigarette holder and is not easily inhaled directly. See below for details on other medicines to prevent nicotine poisoning.</p>
<p>9.  Smoke no more than five cigarettes a day; more is harmful. Your body should be checked annually for nicotine poisoning.</p>
<p>10. When smoking indoors, air should be circulated; do not close windows tightly, lest smoke fill the air.</p>
<h3>Nicotine Poisoning</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>We smokers should know the poisonous quality of nicotine in various tobaccos. However, the amount of nicotine varies depending on the types produced in each country. Now, the poisonous qualities contained in the tobaccos shipped to China from various countries are listed as follows: Egyptian cigarettes contain 2.2 to 1.5 percent; British, French, and American tobacco leaves contain 2.0 to 3.5 percent; Virginia cigars contain 3.5 percent; Brittany tobacco leaves contain 2 percent; Jamaican tobacco leaves contain 1.2 percent; Borldini Negro tobacco leaves contain 1.2 percent; Swiss Berisha tobacco leaves contain 2 to 4 percent; Tuscan cigarettes contain 2 to 4 percent; Oriental tobacco leaves contain 0.8 to 1.2 percent; French cigarettes contain 2 to 3.5 percent; British and American cigarettes contain 1.1 to 2.9 percent. The tobacco leaves produced in the Crimean Peninsula have the highest nicotine content, and the Xinchang tobacco leaves in Zhejiang, China, have the least nicotine content. The amount of nicotine can be determined by the color of the tobacco leaves; light-colored ones have more, and dark-colored ones have less. Nicotine is colorless and odorless; if placed in the air, it turns brown. The lethal dose for nicotine poisoning is 0.03 to 0.06 grams, which is the amount contained in a large tobacco leaf and five cigars. However, people who are addicted to it can tolerate five or six times that amount. If the nicotine in tobacco is reduced by 0.1 percent, the tobacco loses its original flavor, because most of the aroma in tobacco is formed by nicotine. However, not all aromas are nicotine; for example, Egyptian cigarettes have a rich aroma but a very low nicotine content. The acute symptoms of nicotine poisoning include a pale face, cold sweats, salivation, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, collapse, and weakness. However, advocates of nicotine say that nicotine can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and promote the secretion of adrenaline from the adrenal glands, which can increase blood sugar and blood pressure. As for the prevention of nicotine poisoning, you can take some tannic acid or use 0.3 percent ammonium chloride or ammonium ferric citrate and instill it into the pipe and inhale, or you can soak cotton with the above-mentioned medicines and plug it into the mouthpiece, which can also eliminate nicotine poisoning.</p>
<h3>Royal Incense飘渺录 [A Faint Record of Royal Incense]</h3>
<p>— Qin Shoujuan</p>
<p>Introduction to the original author: Qing Princess Der Ling</p>
<p>She and Mr. T. White once had a son, who unfortunately died of illness last spring. Needless to say, our abandoned old woman’s heart suffered an even deeper wound. So, when she submitted this work for publication, she specifically wrote a very painful sentence on the first page, which is In Loving Memory of my son Thaddens Raymond White (In memory of my beloved deceased son Thaddeus Raymond White).</p>
<p>Now, she lives alone in New York, relying solely on the income from selling articles to make a living. But it is said that she has no intention of returning home. This is a brief biography of the original author, Princess Der Ling.</p>
<p>Didn't I say above that they have a total of five siblings, and the four of them have already passed away? The second and fifth also enjoyed a great reputation. Moreover, when the translator was engaged in translation this time, both of them gave me very grateful guidance through the introduction of my friend Tang Yunfan. Here I can also introduce them to the reader. In this book, they are also a very important part. Xun Ling is currently sixty years old and is the second brother of the original author. He is the one who inherited his father's title. He was very favored when Empress Dowager Cixi was in power. At the same time, he is also a senior photographer with great research on photography. None of the photos taken of Cixi in her life were not taken by him. He is currently living a very comfortable life as a retired gentleman in Beiping.</p>
<p>Rong Ling, also known as Princess Shanshou (given by Cixi, referring to Longevity Mountain), is the biological sister of the original author, ranked fifth. She is currently the wife of General Tang Baochao and is considered a very prominent figure in Beiping social circles. She also served as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Dowager Cixi in the inner court, and later wrote a book in English called (Xiang Fei), which is still popular and praised by many people in Europe and America.</p>
<p>Because of the guidance of the two of them, the translator was able to translate it without missing a word, which is really gratifying. However, the crudeness of the translation still cannot be concealed. I am ashamed, I am ashamed! (II)</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-sixth</p>
<p>Generously revealing his heart to serve the country, forgetting his family; sadly facing the jade mirror, sighing for my sweetheart.</p>
<p>This shout startled Gui Zhi, who quickly took out a handkerchief to wipe her tears, replying, "Nothing? The raindrops are too noisy to sleep, so I thought I'd find something to do, but I haven't started yet." Jiang Shi had already entered the hall and was pushing the bedroom door with her hand, saying, "Open it, I have something to say to you." Gui Zhi originally didn't want to open the door, but since her mother had secretly come to visit, it must be for a purpose. If she didn't let her in, she would become even more suspicious. So, she first turned up the flame of the kerosene lamp a bit higher, then opened the door and let Jiang Shi in. Jiang Shi entered the room and first looked up at Gui Zhi's face, saying, "Child, why are you crying?" Gui Zhi forced a smile and said, "I'm not crying!" Jiang Shi said, "How can you say you're not crying? I've been watching outside the window for a long time." Gui Zhi knew that she couldn't deny it, so she sighed and said, "I was thinking about it here. It's so cold here now. I was thinking that it must be even colder outside the pass. Since Ziqiang left, he sent a letter on the day he arrived, but now I don't know if he's still at Xifengkou." Jiang Shi said, "You're overthinking it. If he's fine, why would he keep writing to you? If he had changed his location, wouldn't he have sent a letter home?" Gui Zhi didn't say anything, but picked up the photo on the table and hung it back on the wall. But she used one index finger to wipe away all the tears that had dripped on the photo. Jiang Shi stood next to her and pressed her arm with her hand, whispering, "Child, you're a smart person, how can you be so pessimistic? Your father-in-law is thinking about you day and night. If you do this, aren't you just adding to the old man's worries?" (353)</p>

<h3>Jiangda Basketball Concludes</h3>
<p>Six Wins in Six Games, Victory Over Daxia Yesterday</p>
<p>Fudan University Wins Championship</p>
<p>Almost Defeated by Daxia Yesterday</p>
<p>Daxia Faces Challenge with Only Four Players in the End</p>
<p>Result: 34 to 22</p>
<p>The Fudan University basketball team won every game in this Jiangda Basketball Championship. Yesterday afternoon, they played their final game against Daxia at the Daxia court. The Daxia athletes performed exceptionally well and showed great strength. Although Fudan was strong, they were unfamiliar with the court, which made them helpless and almost lost. In the first half, Daxia took the lead with 12 to 10. In the second half, Daxia continued to lead. Later, three Daxia players, Jing Jianling, Li Desheng, and Ren Jiexing, successively committed four fouls and had to leave the court. Because there were no replacements, they had to face the challenge with only four players. Fudan took the opportunity to rise and finally reversed the defeat with 34 to 22, winning this championship.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation, Fudan Falls Behind</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the game, both sides had tight defenses, and no points were scored for a long time. Suddenly, Fudan gained momentum and took the lead with three points. Daxia refused to be outdone, and Chen Zhaoqiu scored two shots, surpassing them with four to three. The Daxia athletes fought more and more vigorously, leading all the way. Fudan tried to make a comeback and once tied the score at eight to nine. In this tense situation, Chen Zhaoqiu made two more excellent shots. The first half ended with Daxia leading with 12 to 10.</p>
<h3>Daxia Suffers a Miserable Defeat Facing Challenge with Four Players</h3>
<p>As the second half began, Fudan worked harder and competed fiercely. The score went back and forth repeatedly. Before long, with the efforts of Qiu Guangxie, Fudan caught up with 14 to 13. However, Daxia quickly added two goals, making it 17 to 14. Daxia defender Li Longsheng committed four fouls and had to leave the court. Fudan scored another goal, making it 20 to 16. Then, Zhang Jinxiang penetrated under the basket, and Zhong Enling also committed four fouls. Zhang made three points with one shot, making it 20 to 19. When Qiu Guangxie scored two free throws, Fudan finally surpassed them with 21 to 20. At this time, Ren Jiexing also had to leave the court. Daxia faced the challenge with four players, outnumbered and inevitably defeated. The final score was 34 to 22.</p>

<h3>Far East Roundtable Conference</h3>
<p>Still No Definite Date</p>
<p>Yamamoto Tadashi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Philippine Representatives Expected to Arrive in a Few Days</p>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency) Yamamoto Tadashi of Japan, who previously visited Wang Zhengting, Shen Silang, and others in Shanghai with a representative of the puppet organization, Zheng, intending to allow the puppets to participate in the Far East Games, was rejected by us. Recently, he went to the Philippines to negotiate, still conspiring to involve the puppet organization in the issue, and was again despised by the Philippine authorities and overseas Chinese. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the President Jackson of the Da Lai Company and will attend the roundtable conference to be held in Shanghai. He still intends to shamelessly seek a final clearance from our authorities. According to the person in charge of the Association for the Advancement of Sports, who spoke to the Shen Shi News Agency reporter yesterday, the Philippine representatives will not be able to take a boat to Shanghai for several days, and the date of the conference has not yet been determined. He has not met with Yamamoto either. As for what he said that our country has allowed the puppet Manchuria to participate in an individual capacity, it is purely his wishful thinking and not a fact. Our authorities have consistently adhered to the bottom line, and the Japanese, no matter how cunning, will ultimately be unable to achieve this conspiracy. It is heard that Japan, in order to increase its lobbying power, has dispatched Matsuzawa Ichikaku to Shanghai to assist. Matsuzawa arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 aboard the Nagasaki Maru. His activities are still unknown.</p>
<h3>International Volleyball Last Night: USA Defeats Jewish Team</h3>
<p>Federation Forfeits to Russia</p>
<p>Two games were originally scheduled for the Shanghai International Volleyball Tournament last night. However, the Federation temporarily forfeited to Russia, so only one game remained between the United States and the Jewish team. The Jewish players were of average height, and their strength was not weak. The United States won with great difficulty, with a final score of only two to one. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>USA (45): 15-12, 10-15, 15-6 Jewish (33)</p>

<p>(Tianjin Electric) The Hebei Province preliminary for the North China region of the Far East track and field competition was held at the Nankai Middle School sports field at 10:00 AM. A break was taken at noon, and the competition continued at 2:00 PM. Because the athletes had not practiced for a long time, the results were average. As a result, nine athletes, including Liu Furun, Huang Yi, Zhao Qiming, Wang Shiming, Yan Chengtian, Zheng Sen, Han Jinglin, Huo Baozhang, and Wu Bixian, were selected to participate in the North China region preliminary. It was also decided that Zhao Wenxuan would be the coach of the Hebei team and Song Rui would be the manager. Today, except for Huang Yi's pole vault result of 3.37 meters, Liu Furun's shot put of 12.01 meters, and the javelin, the rest did not reach the standard. When selecting athletes, their usual results were used as the basis for selection. (One day)</p>

He has now received a reply telegram from Zhu stating that he cannot come to Zhenjiang due to official business, and has sent Deputy Director Zhang Huafu as a representative. It is reported that Zhang has already arrived in Zhenjiang yesterday. The other judges hired, Gao Hefei, Luo Zhuohan, Jiang Xuhai, Zhang Lianfen, Hou Zhiqing, Yuan Ying, Lai Zhongwei, Cheng Jihou, Yuan Qishou, and Wang Jingxi, are all current officials from the General Supervision Department's Security Office Military Training Institute and other places, and are well-versed in military knowledge.</p>
<p>Review Ceremony: According to Director Hu, the purpose of holding this exercise is to enhance the students' martial spirit, to integrate soldiers into agriculture, and to integrate generals into learning. It only seeks to invigorate the students' spirit and to make their movements orderly, just like a normal military review. Therefore, the ceremony is not elaborate. Only the General Review Officer gives a speech before the review begins. The layout in front of the reviewing stand is also extremely simple, with only a white cloth banner hung on the reviewing stand, reading "General Review of Jiangsu Military Training Students Spring Break, 23rd Year of the Republic of China". The couplets on both sides are "Strengthening the nation is about combining literacy and martial arts, and military training cultivates a fearless spirit". A portrait of the Premier is hung in the middle, and slogans are pasted all around.</p>
<p>Number of People Reporting: The original plan was for twenty-five schools to participate, but because the instructor of the Yan and Cuiying schools, Huang Xianli, requested leave due to illness and could not participate, the actual number of schools was twenty-three, with a total of one thousand three hundred and seventy-seven people. In addition, Private Xichang School was not listed, but it has already reported yesterday. Whether it will formally participate is still being considered by the Military Training Committee. The names of the reporting schools, the number of people, and the names of the instructors are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiangnan District Schools: Shangzhong, number of people 103, instructor's name Jia Jianping; Su Gong Zhuan, 37, Wang Yixuan; Suzhou Middle School, 97, Wang Yixuan; Su Nong, 35, Huang Xianli; Changzhou Middle School, 75 Chen Diping; Nanjing Middle School, 146, He Jichang; Zhenjiang Normal School, 61, Tang Yuanli; Taicang Normal School, 50, Zeng Weigong; Xixi Normal School, 66, Tang Shiquan; Education Institute, 75, Wang Weixian; Private Xichang School, 35, Wang Weixian; Songjiang Middle School, 32, Xu Xienong; Fisheries School, 71, He Liangxin; Yixing Middle School, 32, Liu Pingfan.</p>

<p>Field Exercise: Today's field exercise was originally scheduled to be held in Zhaze, but it was decided to change it to Laoshantou outside the East Gate due to the inconvenience of traveling back and forth over the sketch. The entire team is divided into North and South armies, with one based on the south side of the mountain and the other based on the north side. One is mainly defending and the other is mainly attacking, practicing encounter battles, reconnaissance actions, and occupying positions.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Campsite: The campsite is divided into North and South zones. The Jiangnan camp is located in the provincial stadium, with a total of fourteen schools, including Nanjing Middle School, which has the largest number of people, with eight bell-shaped tents and twelve house-shaped tents, which are neat and impressive. The interior of the tents is clean, and the students' discipline is particularly good. Other schools, such as Zhenjiang Normal School and Shangzhong, are also very neatly arranged. The camp gate of Zhenjiang Normal School is more unique than other schools. The Jiangbei district is located in the county stadium, with a total of nine schools, including Yangzhou Middle School, camped on the east and west ends of the field. Nantong Academy is also there, and the academy's medical rescue team also came to Zhenjiang with the team, bringing a rescue vehicle and rescue supplies. The entire team wears white clothes and white hats, with red cross badges on their chests, and those who do not know the situation almost suspect that a large number of doctors have been invited.</p>
<p>Various Countries' Indemnity Funds and Educational and Cultural Undertakings (2)</p>
<p>2.  The Maturity Period of the Returned Funds</p>
<p>In the sixth year of the Republic of China, China proposed to the Allied Powers to postpone the payment of indemnities. For the sake of enhancing the friendly relations and cultural ties between the two countries, Chinese and American figures further advocated that the US government should return all the remaining portions of the US indemnity funds. After this movement occurred, it was greatly supported by the political and academic circles in the United States. People like Senator Lodge, Representative Porter, Director of the Eastern Bureau of the State Department Marmary, Professor Monroe of Columbia University, and Miss Vautier in China all did their best. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Ambassador Shi Zhaoji formally contacted the US side. Just as things were about to succeed, both the upper and lower houses of Congress were closed, and the matter was put on hold. It was not until the thirteenth year that the two houses of the US Congress passed the continuation of the return of the remaining portion of the indemnity funds to China, and expressed the hope that this fund would be used to develop China's educational and cultural undertakings. China was grateful for the great kindness of the United States and gladly accepted it.</p>
<p>3.  The US Continues to Return the Funds</p>
<p>There was no formal exchange of notes between China and the United States regarding the return of the indemnity funds. The US Secretary of State only sent a note to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States on June 14th of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), stating that the US upper and lower houses of Congress had passed this fund return bill and it had been approved by the US President. The Foreign Ministry of the Northern Government of China then sent a telegram in the name of the President to express its gratitude. The return of the funds was thus a great success.</p>
<p>4.  Total Amount of Returned Funds</p>
<p>The total amount of the US indemnity funds returned was 6,137,552.90 US dollars in principal and 6,407,885.77 US dollars in interest, totaling 12,545,438.67 US dollars.</p>
<p>5.  The Amount Allocated to Educational and Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>The uses of the US indemnity funds are divided into (1) developing scientific knowledge and the application of this knowledge to China's circumstances, with the aim of promoting technical education, scientific research, experimentation and demonstration, and the training of scientific teaching methods; and (2) promoting cultural undertakings of a permanent nature, such as libraries. Each year, a portion of the returned funds is allocated to a permanent fund, and the remainder is used for educational and cultural undertakings as follows: (1) scientific professorships; (2) scientific research professorships; (3) scientific research grants and scholarships; (4) the Scientific Education Advisory Committee, later changed to the Editorial Committee; (5) the Social Investigation Institute; (6) the National Peiping Library; (7) the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute; (8) subsidies to the China Science Society Geological Survey, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and universities such as Datong, Nankai, Lingnan, Fudan, Zhonghua, Jinling, etc., the Wenhua Library, the Palace Museum, the Industrial Practice Society, the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, the Chinese Education Improvement Society, the Chinese Civilian Education Promotion Association, the Chinese Geographical Society, and the Chinese United Mulberry Improvement Association, etc. The exact amount used for educational and cultural undertakings in each year was 1,826,822.12 national currency yuan in the fourteenth year, 1,610,294.05 in the fifteenth year, 1,463,310.24 in the sixteenth year, 1,732,708.12 in the seventeenth year, 1,931,948.27 in the eighteenth year, and 1,740,700.62 in the nineteenth year. After the twentieth year, the data has not been investigated.</p>
<p>6.  The Organization of the Board of Directors</p>
<p>Regarding the US indemnity funds, the board of directors is named the China Educational and Cultural Foundation Board of Directors, and is organized with fifteen directors, with China accounting for two-thirds and the United States accounting for one-third. The first time, they were appointed by the Chinese government. After that, each time there was a vacancy, the board of directors elected a replacement to be reported to the government for record. The term of office for the first time was determined by the board of directors by drawing lots at the third annual meeting, with the exception of three people who would serve another year. The remaining three people each would serve two, three, and four years. After that, the term would be five years. Their powers are based on the US Secretary of State's note and the Chinese Ambassador to the United States' reply, to preserve the US portion of the returned indemnity funds and use these funds to promote China's educational and cultural undertakings.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Interpretation: Qualifications of Rural Normal School and Vocational School Graduates</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, through the Hunan Provincial Department of Education, forwarded a request from the Yiyang County Education Bureau for an interpretation of the qualifications of rural normal school graduates and vocational school graduates (stating that according to the primary school regulations, those who graduated from a simplified normal school for two years or more and have served as primary school teachers for two years or more may be exempted from examinations and assessments, but those who graduated from a three-year rural normal school and have served for only one and a half years have only half a year less experience, but one year more academic qualifications, and according to the reasons given by these students, the practical results in school can offset this half-year of experience, and there is no conflict with the law, and they ask to be allowed to review their resumes. Furthermore, various vocational school graduates, based on the length of their studies, have exceeded the old-system middle school or simplified normal school, and their studies are also proficient in several subjects, and they are indeed qualified to serve as specialist teachers, and they have now reported for resume review one after another, but according to the primary school regulations and the county's review methods, there are no regulations for this qualification, and it is not known how it should be compared with the old-system of senior high school, or whether they should be allowed to review their qualifications. Please give instructions.) The ministry then instructed the department stating that it is said that the service period of graduates from the three-year rural normal school is one and a half years, which is half a year less than the experience stipulated in Article 78, Section 2 of the Primary School Regulations, but the academic qualification is one year more. The two offset each other and there is no discrepancy, and they should be allowed to review their resumes. As for the graduates of various vocational schools, whose qualifications are equivalent to those of the old-system middle school, they can also be allowed to review their resumes in accordance with the provisions of Article 78, Section 1 of the Primary School Regulations. However, vocational school graduates are all specializing in a certain subject, and should be allowed to serve as specialist teachers. Please take note immediately.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Interpretation: Qualifications of Rural Normal School Special Course Graduates</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Jiangsu Department of Education, forwarded a request from the Kunshan County Education Bureau for the verification of the qualifications of the Kunshan, Jiading, and Qingpu counties' rural normal school special course graduates, and issued an instruction interpreting that, after investigating the ministry's instructions on the Huang Jiabai's request for interpretation of the rural normal school special course graduate's admission qualifications, the so-called "(otherwise, it should be judged based on the admission qualifications and the length of study)" refers to the admission qualifications and length of study stipulated by a certain rural normal school special course, and does not refer to the admission qualifications of each individual student. The logic is very clear. The department's interpretation of the admission qualifications of each individual student is a misunderstanding. If the admission qualifications stipulated by the Kunshan, Jiading, and Qingpu counties' rural normal school special course are junior high school graduates, and the length of study is two years, then the qualifications of the graduates of the school should be equivalent to two years of senior high school normal school, and there should be no difference due to the admission qualifications of each individual. Please take note immediately.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Xiamen University's Finances: Chen Jiageng Still Remits 6,000 Yuan Per Month</h3>
<p>(Xiamen Correspondent) Xiamen University was founded by overseas Chinese Chen Jiageng. It began in the tenth year of the Republic of China and has been around for fourteen years. Chen has used more than four million yuan. Recently, the economy in various places has been sluggish, especially in the Nanyang rubber tree and production industries. Therefore, Chen Jiageng's company has closed down and is being liquidated. Xiamen University's finances have been reduced repeatedly since Chen's business declined. The monthly expenses are about 20,000 yuan. On the revenue side, Chen Jiageng's main company in Singapore still remits 6,000 yuan per month, the central government subsidizes 5,000 yuan per month, and the Fujian Provincial Government subsidizes 5,000 yuan per month. These three items can get 16,000 yuan per month. If tuition income increases, it can offset it. Recently, since Song Ziwen left the Ministry of Finance, the central government has only been able to get half the amount, or 2,500 yuan per month. Therefore, if tuition income is low, it will not be enough. According to President Lin Wenqing, Jimei School was founded in the first year of the Republic of China, and Xiamen University was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China. They have both been maintained for more than ten or twenty years by Chen Jiageng's personal efforts, using more than 10 million yuan. Last year, the school's finances had problems. Xiamen locals were asked to donate and organize the Xiamen University Cultural Promotion Association. With the support of all sectors of society, it only raised 6,000 yuan in four months. Last year, in August, I went to Nanyang on business and only raised 6,000 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medical Association Holds Second Annual Meeting in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 2nd) More than 200 members of the Chinese Medical Association's Second Annual Meeting visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 7:00 AM on the 2nd. The opening ceremony was held at the Lishi Society at 9:00 AM, with more than 400 members and guests in attendance. Chairman Qi Shounan gave a speech, briefly stating that the association was established in the fourth year of the Republic of China and has a history of twenty years. It has grown from 36 members to more than 1,700 members, and he detailed three points: (1) scientific medicine, (2) physician education, and (3) physician investigation and improvement. Next, Chu Minyi, the representative of the Executive Yuan, gave a speech, briefly stating that medicine must be studied openly and thoroughly, adopting scientific methods. There should be no distinctions based on names such as Chinese medicine, Western medicine, or German medicine. One should focus on the whole country, the whole world, and all of humanity. Next, Wang Shijie gave a speech, briefly stating that China has had contact with European and Western culture for hundreds of years, but scientific medicine has still not developed. There are several reasons for this: one is the number of medical talents, one is the ethics of medicine, three is the general public's inability to afford medicine, and four is the low level of general education. He hoped that everyone would contribute more to the first three points in order to promote scientific medicine. Next, Liu Ruiheng gave a speech, briefly stating that the papers at this conference are very valuable. They are not words of ideal plans and criticisms, but are all based on science, and the authors are all well-known people in the country, which is a special feature. He hoped that everyone would visit the Health Department's Health Experimental Office and the Central Hospital and give more guidance. Then, Chairman and Acting President Niu Huisheng read a speech, reporting on the association's affairs in great detail. The meeting adjourned for a photo at 11:00 AM. All members then opened an administrative meeting. Sectional meetings, reports, and papers were held at 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3>All City Children to Celebrate Children's Day at the Municipal Government Tomorrow</h3>
<p>A Toy Exhibition Will Also Be Added to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee Will Hold Its Fourth Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of All Sectors of this City Celebrating Children's Day, in view of the approaching Children's Day, has been stepping up its work in recent days, and all preparations have been largely completed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Adds a Toy Exhibition: In order to arouse children's interest, in addition to holding a toy exhibition at the Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road, it was decided yesterday to set up a second toy exhibition in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. As for commemorative items, since the Children's Happiness Association publicly solicited them, various businesses have been generous in their donations. As of yesterday, many items have been delivered. The association is currently sorting them out and properly allocating them. Businesses that wish to continue donating should deliver them to the Morning News Office of the association today before noon, or directly to the association's temporary office at the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Four Preparatory Meetings to be Held Today: In order to discuss the reception matters at the venue, the association convened a meeting of important staff at 3:00 PM yesterday and decided that the Social Education Association, the Safety Bureau, and the Health Bureau would each send ten receptionists. It was also decided to hold the fourth preparatory meeting at 10:00 AM today in the second conference room of the Municipal Government, which will serve as the temporary office. At the same time, a discussion meeting will be held for all receptionists. Notices have been sent out separately. As for the maintenance of order at the venue, in addition to the association requesting the Municipal Public Security Bureau to assign a police detachment to be responsible, a letter was sent yesterday to the Shanghai Boy Scout Council requesting them to send Boy Scouts to assist at the celebration ceremony. The presidium of the celebration ceremony has also been hired by the association, including the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Children's Happiness Association, the Education Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, and the Women's National Products Year Movement Committee.</p>
<p>Notice to All Sectors' Children Attending the Meeting: Children from all schools, factories, charities, and ordinary children can participate in tomorrow's celebration ceremony. Adults who wish to visit must bring children. The routes to the meeting are as follows: If taking public transportation, children under six years old are completely free, and children under fifteen years old will be charged half price according to the original ticket purchase method. Those who hire their own cars should drive to the vicinity of the Municipal Government, in front of the 7th District 2nd Sub-station. The association has sent receptionists. Factory children, school children, charity children, and ordinary children are distinguished by labels with the four characters (School) (Factory) (Charity) (Ordinary) on the car. When driving to the front of the Municipal Government, the receptionists will guide them to stand separately in the four designated areas in the square in front of the Municipal Government. The Municipal Public Works Bureau will surround them with short fences. Adults can stand along the outside of the fence. However, only one adult is allowed per child to claim the child.</p>
<h3>County Government Orders Districts to Report and Deliver Education Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau, in accordance with the county government's order to compile a final account, found that among the various income items, such as land rent and capital donations, were handled and transferred by the district offices. This income is the strongest in winter, but checking the number of receipts for this year as of the end of February, there are cases where not a single penny has been delivered, and there are cases where the number delivered is extremely small, which is too different from the budget. With only three months left until the end of the two years, it is impossible to shorten the expenditures, so it is necessary to rectify the income. Therefore, the education bureau presented the status of the educational expenses handled by various districts to the county government, which yesterday issued a notice to all districts to clear and pay the total amount of those already received, and to quickly collect those not yet received.</p>
<h3>Various Elementary Schools Initiate New Life Promotion Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Elementary School Principals' Association, in view of the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which is flourishing in various places, especially elementary school students, should practice it early in order to be fundamental. Therefore, Feng Yixian, Sun Yucai, Feng Xiancheng, Huang Muxiu, and more than ten others were appointed as members of the New Life Movement Promotion Association to actively carry out the movement. The first meeting was held yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers' School Alumni Association Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers' School on Julita Road in the French Concession has an alumni association. However, the alumni, numbering in the thousands, are scattered in various places. Each time a meeting is held, the distance is too far for all of them to attend. It is reported that a regular meeting was held at the school at 2:00 PM on April 1st to elect new officers. No less than a hundred local alumni attended the meeting. The meeting adjourned for a photo around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this semester, Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts on Jiaozhou Road has hired Mao Xiaocen and others to assist the college. After President Wang Xishen took charge of the college affairs, the content has been enriched day by day. Famous professors such as Hu Pu'an, Hu Jichen, Yao Minghui, Chen Huaxian, Chen Yantong, Zhu Xiangwan, Wang Baiyun, Wang Jianyu, Zhou Feicheng, and Li Xuchuan have all come to the college one after another. Famous people from outside the school are invited to give lectures every week. The new school building on Zhongshan Road has also been put out to tender and construction will begin immediately. It is expected that it will be possible to move in after the summer vacation. Recently, since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, the faculty and students of the school, with Zhengfeng valuing etiquette, took the lead in preparing to carry out the movement.</p>
<h3>Chunhe Factory Manufactures Domestic Sports Products</h3>
<p>Chunhe Sports Goods Manufacturing Factory in Tianjin, the largest in China, is well-equipped, including leather making, ball making, racket making, shoe making, sewing, knitting, and iron and wood factory departments. It studies and manufactures all kinds of sports equipment and sports goods, and is said to be in accordance with international standards.

<h3>Dagong Vocational School Builds New School Building</h3>

The foundation stone laying ceremony is scheduled to be held today. The school principal, Lin Meiyan, yesterday held a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to report on the school's recent situation.</p>
<h3>Two New Books on Reviving National Culture</h3>
<p>The May Fourth Movement was the central social turning point in modern Chinese history, its greatness akin to the Renaissance in Western Europe. Even now, one can imagine the fiery, active revolutionary sentiments of the youth of that time. Recently, Chen Duanzhi, based on a new historical perspective and relying on firsthand experiences, has written "A Historical Evaluation of the May Fourth Movement," analyzing the causes and consequences of the movement from multiple angles. He also explores the trend of national cultural revival and the path of revolutionary consciousness construction from various aspects. Notably, the book includes writings by Cai Jiemin, a leader of the movement, which are particularly valuable. Chen's other book, "Lectures on Modern Social Science," is also a groundbreaking standard work on social science. It includes annotations for eighty famous Chinese and foreign social science works. Anyone who wants to understand the principles of modern social science and the path of social science changes must read it. This book is especially suitable for use as a textbook in universities. The former has already been printed, and the latter was published last week, priced at one dollar and twenty cents. It is available at major bookstores such as Shenghuo, Kaiming, and Xiandai.</p>

<h3>How to Transcend Crisis</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>If there is a true (factual) crisis, and it (intensifies) and becomes (acute), then what? The answer to this question is also easy; it is still the same old thing, but it is not only unfavorable to both sides but downright unfavorable to all parties. A certain monk asked (seeking the Way): (What about taking three steps forward?) The answer was: (Bumping your head). (What about taking three steps back?) (Falling a thousand feet). (What about not advancing or retreating?) (Instant death). Then what should one do?!…</p>
<p>The above is the last paragraph of Mr. Wu's article (Crisis). (What should one do?) The text ends there. Who can answer this question?</p>
<p>Before there is a perfect answer, I can offer my opinion. But I will not express my opinion in my own words, because there are ready-made words that can be used. These words appeared in (Free Talk) some time ago, contained in a folk song from Anhui introduced by Mr. Ruizhi: The first half of that folk song says:</p>
<p>(Big stars in the sky face small stars, an eighteen-year-old girl has been looking for her lover until now, not knowing how many dark nights she has walked through, nor how much fear and fright she has suffered. Standing, she fears being seen; lying down, she fears being bitten by mosquitoes. Walking to the front village, the dogs bark; walking to the back village, the tigers growl.) This is indeed what is called (unfavorable to all parties). (Then what should one do?) But the end says:</p>
<p>(One can only summon up the courage and look forward, calling out to her lover with both tenderness and reproach.)</p>
<p>(One can only summon up the courage and look forward). This is also my opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu also mentioned Caesar in his article. One of his stories can serve as a footnote to this saying:</p>
<p>After the Roman Senate issued an order prohibiting Caesar from returning to Rome, Caesar, who was in Gaul, recklessly raised an army in rebellion. But when he reached the Rubicon River, which was between Gaul and Rome, he could not help but hesitate: Should he cross the river? That would be defying the Senate's order and would inevitably lead to rebellion, but Pompey's power was strong, and the outcome was uncertain. Should he return to Gaul? That would be surrendering to the Senate's order, which he was unwilling to do. Moreover, he would inevitably be annihilated by them in the future…</p>
<p>(What should one do?) As a result of much deliberation, Caesar finally shouted Alea Zacta est! (Let the die be cast!) and crossed the river.</p>
<p>If one does not summon up the courage to move forward, what else can one do? Run crookedly across the desert like an ostrich, or hide one's head in one's wings? But they are often more easily captured by hunters.</p>
<p>In the end, there is only the way back. But if there is a stable road to retreat behind, then what kind of crisis is it!</p>
<h3>Half a Day's Work</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>(Jingzhen, aren't you getting up yet? It's almost seven o'clock.)</p>
<p>Hearing my mother's shout from the main room, I woke up from my dream. The sun was already shining on the windowsill. I don't know why, but for the past two years, I have always lacked enthusiasm for going to school in the morning. It's not like before, when I considered this matter more important than eating, fearing that I would be reprimanded by the teacher if I was late. Now, it's completely different. Going to school and attending classes is just an ordinary thing for me; I'm simply going through the motions. According to my own wishes, I would have long stopped going to school to receive this education as a slave of a conquered nation. I would rather stay at home and do nothing. But after thinking about it carefully, since I cannot escape the current harsh environment, and since I have the opportunity to go out and study, to go and walk around, then instead of simply wasting my days at home, it is better to go to school. By doing so, I can also gain a better understanding of how education as a slave of a conquered nation differs from education in the past, and what direction the development of education as a slave of a conquered nation will take in the future. Therefore, for the past two years, I have remained a student in name only. To be honest, I have never once seriously looked at my homework. Perhaps this is why I get up so late in the morning.</p>
<p>Looking up at the small clock on the table next to me, it was once smashed by a Japanese soldier who broke in to inspect. Later, a new piece of glass was put on it. The clock face clearly indicates that it is only five minutes to seven o'clock. Yes, it's not early; it's time for me to get up.</p>
<p>(Ah! I'm getting up, Mother.)</p>
<p>Answering my mother's call, I turned over and got out of bed. While getting dressed, I suddenly remembered what the training director reported yesterday. He wanted all the students to arrive at school promptly at 7:30 this morning. Yes, as he said, today is September 15th, the anniversary of the first week of the (New Country) being recognized by Japan. There will be a grand celebration. Time has passed unnoticed for five minutes. It's exactly seven o'clock. I cannot afford to delay any longer. I hurriedly washed my face, ate breakfast, and then said goodbye to my mother: (Mother, I'm leaving.)</p>
<p>The road was as peaceful as usual, except that every household had a new national flag hanging at the door, fluttering in the September morning breeze. Everywhere on the walls, there was no shortage of colorful paper slogans. Because the colors were so dazzling, some passersby used their literacy skills to stop and read them aloud.</p>
<p>(Celebrating the first anniversary of the recognition of the New Country.)</p>
<p>(Celebrating the recognition, we thank our friendly neighbors for their great kindness.)</p>
<p>(Long live the Great Japanese Empire.)</p>
<p>(Long live the Great Manchurian Empire.)</p>
<p>(Suppress bandits, pacify the people, and implement benevolent rule.)</p>
<p>I had already read through them twice as I heard others reciting them. I planned to read them again to see if there were any other slogans. Finally, I saw a newly posted large advertisement on another wall, clearly showing two lines of text in black ink:</p>
<p>(Commemorating the two-year anniversary of September 18th.)</p>
<p>(Commemorating the one-year anniversary of September 15th.)</p>
<h3>Hakka Love Songs</h3>
<p>— Qiutao</p>
<p>(1) Not afraid of being beaten, not worried about being scolded, slipping out the back door when beaten at the front door; even if the skin is bruised and the tendons are not broken, I won't give up on my lover until I die!</p>
<p>(2) Daring to release doves, daring to put on bells, daring to walk on the road with my lover; if anyone dares to spread rumors of adultery, I'll take the lawsuit to Nanjing City.</p>
<p>(3) Not afraid of death, not afraid of life, not afraid of my husband's broken ankles; even if the ankles are broken, leaving only toes, we will keep going as long as we both have our lives.</p>
<p>(Note) The word (唔) means the same as (不), or "not."</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Wei Mang</p>
<p>We sat silently and forlornly by the window. Dusk had already crept into the room, and the courtyard was silent.</p>
<p>We were almost glad to have this dusk in the courtyard all to ourselves on this day. At the same time, we could not help but feel a deep sense of sadness in the silence of this dusk.</p>
<p>There were so many things we wanted to say to each other. We were a newly married couple. Looking at each other, tears filled our eyes. I reached out and held her hand tightly. In front of us were a quilt, a suitcase, and a net basket. I was almost crying!</p>
<p>These past few days, I have seen her forcing a smile, and the sadness in my heart is something that only those who have experienced it can understand. She would often walk into the next room with tears in her eyes during our private conversations. She did not let her emotions of parting be fully revealed in front of me. She was controlling herself. I had also told her not to worry about packing, that it was nothing to me, and that I could get it all done in an hour or two.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I went to the market in the afternoon, and when I came back, the net basket, suitcase, and quilt had all been arranged properly.</p>
<p>She had opened the suitcase for me to see, and all the clothes I needed to wear had been placed inside. There was also a handwritten list of clothes attached to the inside of the lid. All the books in the net basket were ones that I wanted to take with me, and the inkstone box had been polished brightly, with white cotton paper prepared inside. There were also several new pens with copper pen caps.</p>
<p>I don't need to describe the feelings I had when I later found a handkerchief that she often used in my pocket. At that moment, I could not help but feel sad.</p>
<p>My mother died early, and I have no sisters. Family was simply a cold memory for me in the past; my heart had never been warmed here. At that time, how could I have imagined that parting would be so painful for me today?</p>
<p>I said quietly:</p>
<p>(I will come back as soon as I have a vacation.) As soon as I said it, I knew it was a foolish thing to say, but unexpectedly, because of this foolish thing, she could not restrain her emotions after all, and she cried on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I kissed her, but I couldn't find a smarter word to comfort her!</p>
<h3>On Translation (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Dun</p>
<p>Then what if there are difficulties? Either translate the original text and consult the dictionary, or better yet, use a consultant, or even better, a foreign engineer! There is no other way. In scholarship, there is no room for pretense, no royal road, and no room for trickery! 2. Oral translation is better than written translation, and collaborative translation is better than individual translation. Except for literary works that require a unique understanding, such as poetry, where one feels that only oneself can translate it, it is easier for two or three people (too many people can be inconvenient) with common interests to study and discuss together, and they can have more interest, less effort, and more success. But it also requires calmness and tranquility; no quarreling allowed! No fighting allowed! Although it is admirable to bear the burden alone and endure the loneliness, it is ultimately unnecessary! There is also a small experience to share with book translators, namely that translating is sometimes not troublesome, but copying a huge work is felt to be a heavy task. The simple method is to have someone else copy it after revising it.</p>
<p>Yan Jidao's theory of translation has three principles: fidelity, expressiveness, and elegance. These secretly align with the three principles of art: truth, goodness, and beauty. They can be taken as a model. Fidelity means truthfulness, expressiveness means clarity, and elegance means beauty. Now when we look at the Tang dynasty translations of Buddhist scriptures, especially the treatises and verses, we cannot help but be amazed at the profoundness of the ancients. In terms of reasoning, if one is slightly familiar with that kind of grammar, one feels that not a single word is moved, added, or subtracted. Luther and Melanchthon co-translated the Greek Bible, and the hardship of their work was such that they often translated only three lines in four days, but this established the foundation of the German language. The (Mandarin) translation of the Old and New Testaments is also a masterpiece. Generally speaking, after fidelity and expressiveness are achieved, a style naturally emerges, opening up a new literary form, which is to be expected. Perhaps asking the ancients to translate the Buddhist scriptures into another, more accessible and easier-to-understand literary form, so that ordinary people can easily understand them, and feel that they are (pleasing to the eye) is impossible. Fidelity can be achieved through effort, but expressiveness requires considerable talent. A's translation is inexpressive, but B's translation is expressive. There is a great difference in skill. Elegance can only be relied on heaven; it cannot be deliberately created. However, since there is already a style, it will naturally take on a certain form. Therefore, I have copied out the eight conditions of Master Yanzong:</p>
<p>In order to translate well, one must have eight preparations and ten rules:</p>
<p>1. Sincerely receive the Dharma, with the aim of benefiting others.</p>
<p>2. Before entering the battlefield, first secure the foundation of precepts.</p>
<p>3. Be proficient in the Three Treasures of the scriptures and penetrate the five vehicles of meaning.</p>
<p>4. Have broad knowledge of literature and history, and be skilled in embellishing classical phrases, but not clumsy.</p>
<p>5. Have a broad and tolerant mind, be open-minded and inclusive, and not be fond of clinging to one's own views.</p>
<p>6. Be immersed in Taoist arts and indifferent to fame and wealth, and not seek to show off.</p>
<p>7. Know Sanskrit and not abandon that learning.</p>
<p>8. Be familiar with Cang Jie and Ya, and be roughly familiar with seal script and official script, so as not to be ignorant of this writing.</p>
<p>In the past, in prosperous times, translation was regarded as an extremely noble and great undertaking, and translators were all (masters). This work was connected to religion, and was felt to be related to body, mind, and life, so although it was very hard, the results were particularly good. There are few typos in Buddhist scriptures, probably for this reason. Today, people translate Western works, but lack this kind of faith. Although some people use this to make a living, their aim is to sell books, which is no different from doing business. In business, all that matters is variety and quick delivery. They don't care about the essence, let alone the impact of a book after translation on the readers. It is even more amazing to see modern Westerners translating each other's works. Generally speaking, any important work that exists in country A will be translated in country B, so translating without the author's permission is considered theft. There are as many as forty translations of Faust in English, and even the Japanese have translated the complete works of literary figures such as Tolstoy and Shakespeare, which truly shames us!</p>
<p>Is there anyone who truly feels that they are shouldering the mission of introducing Western culture and solemnly regard translation as a lifelong work? We need such (masters)! (End)</p>
<h3>Spring Street</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>No sun, no rain, spring often has these days. Women's bodies tremble: the mysterious street always carries fragrance.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Crossroads: this side is Motoka, that side is a wheelbarrow; you see this scenery, is there a century of distance?</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>When the nocturne of the metropolis is mixed, human flesh and animality wrestle; breath hides infinite sins; some people are addicted to jazz, some people endure hunger and cold and rise up!</p>
<h3>Going Home</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>|Random Notes from a Windowless Room, Part 2|</p>
<p>Suddenly, a whim came over me, and I felt that I wouldn't be happy unless I went home. My bizarre behavior was really prompted by a secret that I couldn't express, like sleepless nights and inexplicable heart palpitations that no one could understand. A sick heart is definitely not something that ordinary people can measure. If you told the truth about your heart, people would laugh at you. I understood this flavor, so whenever I wanted to do something very special, I always explained it to everyone with a different reason.</p>
<p>This time, the reason for returning home was to observe Qingming. I felt that this was enough to shut everyone up, because the reason seemed very legitimate. Isn't Qingming Festival a day for tomb sweeping? Moreover, land sales in the northern custom must be decided before this holiday. I am the sole owner of my family, which is well known to everyone.</p>
<p>(The countryside during Qingming Festival is really poetic!) Everyone said, and this really revealed half of my heart.</p>
<p>After running all day, I felt dizzy. The excessive insomnia and the excitement of anticipating the joy of returning home made my face burn. When I returned to the windowless room in the evening, oh, there were already three guests who had filled this small room. I felt happy because these three people were all people I liked, all like-minded. The three of them lay on the bed board, and I stood by the table, talking, talking. The topic didn't have a fixed direction, but every sentence and every word flowed from the heart and had a true flavor. (Ten o'clock!) Everyone seemed a little surprised. They wanted to leave, and I saw them out the door.</p>
<p>(Can't the windowless room keep you anymore?)</p>
<p>(It can't keep me.) The people had already gone far.</p>
<p>I turned back to the main room to say goodbye. My aunt was a little surprised.</p>
<p>(Who were those three people in Western clothes?)</p>
<p>(Friends.)</p>
<p>(This small room has become glorious because of you. (Talking and laughing with learned people, and there are no uneducated people coming and going.) This room can be called a humble room.)</p>
<p>The train carried me away from the city. The morning light shone on the open fields, and the open fields were green and full of life. I took a deep breath, as if I were seeing the sun for the first time. My heart also felt lighter.</p>
<p>The journey of eighty li only took two hours by train, but I didn't take it. There was my reason for this, which I couldn't tell anyone. I took a small cart, letting it bump and jostle on the uneven ancient road, until my bones ached. I was happy like this. The wheat seedlings had not yet covered the crows, stretching green from my feet to the horizon. A scent of earth rolled into my nostrils from the cartwheels, which was a supreme enjoyment. A row of weeping willows on the long embankment stretched as far as the eye could see, yellow, and there were already spring crows calling to pedestrians. The village girls washing clothes in the thawed little river wanted to see people first and blushed themselves first. Some naked children were busy building fish weirs, happily clapping their bare legs. I wanted to jump down and join in. I was born in the countryside, and this life is a true reflection of my childhood.</p>
<p>From afar, I saw the mountains of my hometown, and my heart used the mountains to measure the distance to my hometown. When I arrived home, it was already dusk, and there were many children flying kites in the evening breeze.</p>
<p>Under the small lamp, a group of people gathered to tell stories, and my heart was at peace. However, they told even more shocking real stories, giving me more evidence of the rural bankruptcy that I already knew. At night, I wanted to sleep, but I didn't dare to. I connected my heart and ears, and lay on my pillow listening to the movement of the dogs!</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Climbs to New Heights</h3>
<p>All Bonds Reach New High Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly saw a sharp rise in the market. Although the market price was high, buyers did not dislike the high price. Although new high prices were emerging one after another, buyers still scrambled to enter the market. The salt tax had already risen to 68%, and the hope of 70% was within reach. The situation on the trading floor was extremely tight, and large investors were entering and exiting the market very actively. Examining the reason, it was rumored that Huang Fu would be in charge of foreign affairs, and there was also hope for a new loan. This kind of rumor is most likely to move people. What the facts are is still vague. However, since the reorganization of the national tax, the annual increase in income has been 20 to 30 million yuan, which is not far from the truth. In this time of extreme market prosperity, this kind of rumor will naturally continue to rise. However, observing the buying and selling parties on the trading floor, the bulls have gradually moved into the hands of retail investors, and most people in the financial world are gradually spitting them out. At the initial opening of the market yesterday morning, there was an image of stable circling. Although there were many transactions, they were still balanced. Since No. 50 absorbed the unified salt tax, the market price gradually increased, gradually rising strongly, about half a yuan. The rumors of the consolidation of the 96th Day Gold section had not subsided, and it soared by another seven jiao. The Zheng 6 also rose by seven jiao. The trend was very good. The demobilization in the secondary market rose sharply by about half a yuan. The forecast of 70 yuan was only four jiao away. The selling momentum of other types was also sharp. The gold short futures even soared by eight jiao, with a momentum like a galloping horse, which was particularly unstoppable. Therefore, trading was extremely active. The market opened in the afternoon, close to 4:00 pm, and then the market was allowed to open, so for the time being, only one market was done. The bulls on the trading floor temporarily came out of the cage. Except for the 96th long term, which was still slightly good by two jiao, the rest rose sharply and fell back slightly, slightly lower by two or three jiao. In total, the market price results were still consistently high, mostly by two or three jiao to six jiao or so. The Gold Short 22nd Customs, Zheng 696, and Gold Long and other types rose by seven jiao to one yuan or so. All bond markets saw new high prices, with a general impression of a sunny and breezy day and a riot of flowers in bloom. The total volume of transactions was estimated to be more than 20 million yuan. Because it was already late, it was briefly omitted. The resulting rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rises</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday that the New York stock market said that because the steel company announced an increase in the price of steel by three to four yuan per ton, and because retail business was good, steel stocks took the lead in advancing, and all stocks rose accordingly. Mining stocks rose due to predictions of rising gold prices and silver legislation. The US dollar was stable. The situation in the small exchange market was the same as in the stock market. Bond prices were mixed and slightly higher. Traders' attitudes were clearly more optimistic than before. According to a report from the New York agent of this firm, (securities) short covering and buyers believe that the future of business is bright and that there is also a need. (Wheat) is currently operating in accordance with industry regulations. Speculators have lowered the price of coarse grains, but the market remains immobile and is gradually being supported. The total volume of transactions for the day was 810,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Coal Oil Market Prices Surge by 80 Cents</p>
<p>Coal oil prices have slightly increased since the 2nd of this month due to taxes. New brand coal oil (such as Happiness, Monk Hat, and Eagle brands) has increased by 80 cents, from the original price of $6.40 per pair (two cans) to the current price of $7.20. Old brand coal oil (such as Red Star and Yuan Bao) has also increased by 80 cents, from the original price of $6.60 per pair (two cans) to a uniform price of $7.40. Gasoline is currently selling at 80 cents, a 10-cent increase, with wholesale at 70 cents. The above prices are for sales in this port; prices in other areas may vary slightly due to water transportation costs and other expenses, adding about 10 cents to the prices in this port. The price of white tung oil in Hanshi continues to rise.</p>
<p>[ 　　丨Fine Tung Oil Market Opened Before Yesterday丨 　　]</p>
<p>The price of white tung oil has suddenly risen continuously in recent days. According to details from Hankou, the source is too scarce. The price for sales to foreign firms has increased to $25. However, foreign firms in Hankou are not actively purchasing goods, and American firms are maintaining a very calm attitude. Although European firms have made some transactions, they are limited. The main reason for the price increase is the sudden scarcity of goods, which cannot meet demand. If there is a significant increase in foreign sales, the situation is unpredictable. According to Ying Hang's purchases, the price has already reached $20.34 per "zhi" and may increase by another 6 to 7 cents, while Xiang Tung has reached $21. Local firms in this port are very calm about this price increase because the spring sales have not been strong. Although there is talk of selling Zhejiang tung oil at $21 per "zhu," no deals have been made. The stagnant sales market cannot stimulate buyers' interest, even with rising prices. Based on the current market, unless there are large-scale foreign sales, the price is likely to stabilize at this level. The production volume of fine tung oil in recent years is significantly different from the past. Recently, local firms in this port opened purchases from Wan Xing Yu, Da You Heng, Ji Feng Heng, Ji Tai Heng, and other top-quality brands, totaling about 1,000 barrels. The price of the Wan brand is slightly below $30 per barrel, while the prices of the Da Ji and Liang Sheng brands are slightly lower as usual. However, the quantity is small, and sellers are hoarding the goods.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Shimen Sliced Green Sugar Bids Up by 20 Cents</p>
<p>Not Yet Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed little change, with few transactions and no immediate signs of recovery, mainly due to sluggish actual sales. The Public Association's quoted price of 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $19.80 saw some transactions. The price of 89 Dutch red sugar remained firm, with sporadic transactions at $15.80. Taikoo B-mark refined white sugar was quoted at $20.20, but no transactions occurred. The local factory's Zhen Ji No. 1 refined white sugar saw limited transactions at $18.45. Chao Bang quoted 200+ bags of Huang Gang green sugar at $11.50, unchanged. Long Gang quoted over 100 bags of green sugar at $10.50 to $10.40. Hong Kong firms, citing diminishing inventories of Shimen sliced green sugar, bid up the price to $9.50, but no transactions occurred.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Produce</h3>
<p>Daylily Market Outlook Optimistic</p>
<p>Recently, the daylily market has been sluggish due to slow sales. However, as recent quotes have been made and traders believe that prices have reached a reasonable level, they have been making purchases. Additionally, various trade groups have been inactive for some time and are eager to move. Therefore, according to the general view of industry insiders, the market is likely to improve. The current market is said to have reached a stable position.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Ningzhou Tea Industry Shows Slight Vigor</p>
<p>Ningzhou in Jiangxi Province has historically been an important area for producing and selling black tea to foreign firms. During the peak of Russian sales, the annual export of black tea from this region reached over 100,000 boxes, surpassing the position of Qimen black tea. Since 1920, the production of Indian and Ceylon black tea has been exceptionally strong due to the warm climate. The Ningzhou tea sales in the major markets of England and Russia have been almost entirely taken over. In recent years, only Guangdong's Zhen Zhi Company and local firms have produced and sold 5,000 to 6,000 boxes in Shanghai. The tea industry in this region has been largely ignored. However, since British and Dutch tea merchants have repeatedly restricted production, the prices of Indian and Ceylon tea have recently increased by 30% to 40%. As a result, tea merchants are hopeful about the future of Ningzhou tea and are sending people to the mountains to purchase tea, making it much more active than in previous years.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Discourse on New Morality and (Old Morality) Ji Yun</p>
<p>The two words "(New)" and "(Old)" are naturally affirmed by comparing them with each other using time as the standard. Material objects with tangible bodies are particularly clearly expressed due to their temporal nature. For example, new clothes and old clothes, new houses and old houses, and even new people and old people, new countries and old countries, new China and old China, are all distinguished by the order of their creation and embryonic state. Even intangible and incorporeal things (abstract things) are distinguished as new or old based on the timing of their occurrence, such as new ideas and old ideas, new doctrines and old doctrines, none of which can escape the determination of time.</p>
<p>There are also things that are not subject to the constraints of time, that do not change their constant form or state. They remain the same after thousands of years as they were thousands of years ago. The scorching sun does not diminish its power over billions of spring and autumn seasons, and the bright moon does not diminish its brilliance over billions of spring and autumn seasons. Therefore, terms such as "new sun" and "old sun," "new moon" and "old moon" are merely materials for literary and ink play. There is no real distinction between new and old in form. Extending this principle, one can understand that any object, because of the tight organization between its molecules, will never be eroded by time and can always maintain its (newness).</p>
<p>(Morality) is a treasure for guiding human conduct and has its own value of existence. It maintains its dignity and, like the sun and moon, cannot be distinguished as new or old. We stubbornly use things that do not last as examples to distinguish between (new morality) and (old morality), which is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, people said, "(One must have sincerity and trustworthiness)," can people in the twentieth or even the hundredth century act deceitfully? Some of the past methods of self-cultivation and governance are considered obsolete, but once they are violated, one will be subject to centrifugal forces and environmental constraints. Therefore, morality is absolutely new, with no distinction between (new morality) and (old morality). Moreover, since it is called (old morality), I wonder where the (new morality) is. One can also ask, "(What is called new morality?)"</p>
<p>Those who are not deeply involved in the world and have weak wills misinterpret this issue, creating countless evils. I want to say in a literary way, "(The one who first made burial figures, will he have no descendants?)"</p>
<p>To put it another way, if new clothes are not yet made, one still wears the old ones; if a new house is not yet built, one still lives in the old one; if the new harvest has not yet come to the market, one still continues to eat old rice. By making such accommodations, at the very least, one will not suffer from cold, hunger, or starvation. If everyone can learn by analogy, society will be much more peaceful.</p>
<p>After Watching the Play Performed by Qingxin Girls' School Fang Zhi Zhong</p>
<p>Evaluation of (Black Bat) Performance</p>
<p>Although I had one semester of history with Qingxin Boys' School in the past, I have always found Qingxin Girls' School, which is close by, desirable but unreachable. Later, although close, they felt like distant neighbors, and I even had fewer chances to see them from afar. Yesterday, I learned that the school was performing a play directed by my old friend Mr. Ying Yunwei, and the thought of seeing it dominated my actions.</p>
<p>The tram sped through the chilly spring air, and soon I was at Kua Long Road. Kua Long Road has shed its former narrow, dirty appearance, revealing plump, clean arms. The two schools, boys' and girls', still stand opposite each other on either side of the road, but they are now more majestic than before. Reaching the gate of Qingxin Girls' School, several visitors were being stopped by the gatekeeper. I took out my name card and asked to see Director Ying. The gatekeeper courteously invited me in. Upon entering, a foreign atmosphere was evident. A patch</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: April Yarn Discovered at a New Low Price in Ten Years</h3>
<p>丨169 Yuan丨</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to fall, the situation being quite precarious. This was because manufacturers could not unite, and the amount of yarn delivered to the exchange was too great. A certain factory's long position was suppressed, and the accumulated amount was entirely liquidated, causing the market to loosen. General retail investors rushed to sell, causing the market to collapse. However, current yarn trading is relatively active. Affected by the unfavorable environment, market prices remain weak. Moreover, the old standard April yarn reached a new low in nearly ten years and broke through the 70 yuan mark.</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, there was still no market for foreign cotton. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and the overall sentiment was very weak. Prices for each month fell by five, six, seven, or eight jiao (tenths of a yuan) to one yuan one jiao. In the afternoon, April yarn reached a new low in ten years, at 169 yuan, a further drop of one yuan one jiao. Distant months fell four, seven, or eight jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 26,250 bales. Of these, 1,300 bales of Dafu were sold, 900 bales of Minghua, 1,650 bales of Renfeng, 900 bales of Jinchang, and 950 bales of Gengfeng. 800 bales of Xincheng were bought, 900 bales of Hengchang, 600 bales of Shenji, 800 bales of Mingde, 850 bales of Yuanda, 400 bales of Chunjji Meiji, and 1,000 bales of Suilong. The highest price, lowest price, and closing price for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance</p>
<p>April 170.7 169.0 169.0 Down 2.20 57,750</p>
<p>May 174.5 173.3 173.3 Down 1.50 39,300</p>
<p>June 175.9 174.4 174.5 Down 1.50 33,100</p>
<p>July 176.5 175.2 175.3 Down 1.30 28,750</p>
<p>August 177.3 176.3 176.4 Down 0.90 57,550</p>
<p>September 177.9 177.1 177.2 丨丨丨丨</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn continued to be brisk. Statistics show that all guilds bought a total of 1,401 bales throughout the day. As the market trended downward, the purchase amount of each guild was as follows: Guangdong 321, Ningbo 20, Shantou 20, Jiangxi 50, Sichuan 200, Inland 160, Northern Guild 400, Yunnan 225, Peers 5.</p>
<h3>Futures Cotton Market Weak with Underlying Firmness</h3>
<p>The cotton market moved towards a downward trend, with the yarn market falling daily, and factory demand stagnating, leading to a lack of confidence. Cotton prices were higher than yarn prices, and new buyers were still scarce. However, some believed that there was good news about American cotton, and new sales were also rare, so the market trend was still weak with underlying firmness. However, cotton prices were relatively too high, and actual sales were bleak.</p>
<p>Zheng Futures Cotton Fell Another Two Jiao. At the opening of the futures cotton market, due to the poor yarn market, American and Indian cotton remained closed and fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao. In the afternoon, there were still few buyers in the market, and long positions were closed. Prices for each month fell again by five fen (hundredths of a yuan) to one and a half jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 42,600 dan (a unit of weight). Of these, 2,500 dan of Chunji were sold, 5,600 dan of Changfeng, 1,200 dan of Xincheng, 1,800 dan of Yuanxingchang, 1,100 dan of Taixing, 1,200 dan of Gengfeng, and 1,000 dan of Changyu. 5,000 dan of Suilong were bought, 1,400 dan of Hengyi, 3,700 dan of Tonghe, and 2,800 dan of Deji. The highest price, lowest price, closing price, and account balance for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Account Balance</p>
<p>April Futures 41.45 41.25 41.25 Down 0.25 148,100</p>
<p>May Futures 41.50 41.40 41.40 Down 0.20 151,300</p>
<p>June Futures 41.45 41.35 41.40 Down 0.20 167,300</p>
<p>July Futures 34.50 34.35 34.40 Down 4.20 96,500</p>
<p>August Futures 34.60 34.50 34.55 Down 0.10 67,100</p>
<p>Total 630,300</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Factory Demand Stagnant. Sales of spot cotton are very sluggish. Factories are all helpless about raw materials because yarn has no outlet. The source is 350 bales of Tong cotton. The current selling price of cotton is as follows:</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 475.0, Yufeng Factory purchase 83 pieces. Spot goods delivered to the factory from yesterday, April.</p>
<h3>Special Margin of 3 Yuan Levied per Dan</h3>
<p>From April 1st, the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange will levy a special margin of 3 yuan in cash per dan for new transactions in this year's April futures cotton. Both parties holding accounts will be charged. An announcement is posted.</p>
<h3>Depressed Tianjin Yarn and Cotton Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: The cotton yarn market in this city is sluggish, with little interest from outside buyers. The market is flat and tired. The Woluogu guild bought 16-count Three Happiness Yarn for 176 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. The Tangshan guild bought 32-count Colorful Ball Yarn for 231 yuan. The Woluogu guild bought 32-count Immortal Peach for 225 yuan. (The above prices include tax.)</p>
<p>Also, the cotton market has only a small number of transactions, which are still considered active. The market is still flat. Ruiyuan Company bought 35 bales of Xihe American Cotton, with an opening price of 40 yuan 7 jiao. Moreover, the delivery of Beihe long-staple cotton continued yesterday, and the active mood has slightly improved. The market trend is even flatter. Xiechang Company bought 116 bales, with an opening price of 41 yuan. Ruiyuan Company bought 50 bales, with an opening price of 40 yuan 5 jiao. There were also 100 bales with an opening price of 40 yuan 8 jiao, it is said.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Still Chaotic</h3>
<p>Banks Have Not Yet Fully Resumed Business</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the banking front, because foreign merchants were still in the period of closing their accounts, only Chinese merchants were open for business. Therefore, although there were no obstacles to transactions, the situation was still somewhat simplified. There was no change in the foreign exchange market. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 4%, and there was no increase in "hua tou" (commission charged by money shops). In terms of "chai piao" (discounted draft) transactions, the morning market transferred over 4.4 million, and new transactions were over 300,000. Afternoon market transactions were over 200,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 400,000. Banks did not receive payments from foreign merchants because they were not open. There was no news of receipts. Chinese banks received over 3 million in drafts, over 3 million in various secured tax payments and miscellaneous expenses, and 300,000 in warehouse releases. Money shops received over 41.1 million in foreign public bills, over 2.1 million in foreign "hua tou" payments, over 300,000 in remittances from various routes, 200,000-300,000 in cash receipts, over 600,000 in foreign pledges, over 1.4 million in banknote inflows and outflows, 200,000 in customer sources, and 350,000 in outflows. In addition, the total amount of exchanges in the Shanghai Clearing House on the 2nd was 8,388,201.85 silver dollars, including 4,724,614.28 silver dollars and 3,663,587.57 silver dollars in remittances.</p>

In addition to being allowed to be released from the factory separately, this is jointly announced."</p>
<h3>Dime Coins All Rise, Copper Coins Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins were 833 yuan in the morning market, the same as the previous day. The afternoon market rose by 1 yuan, to 834 yuan. 5,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 756 yuan in the morning market and 757.5 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in a price increase of 3 yuan. 75,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose slightly by 500 wen, to 322,000 wen. 27,132 strings were traded, with a total value of 9,400 foreign dollars.</p>
<h3>Grain: Northern and Southern Rice Markets Show No Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources (over 6,000 shi (a unit of volume)), with thick japonica rice being more abundant and late rice being slightly scarce, with only a dozen or so sources. The customer base was slightly less enthusiastic, and the sellers were all trying to do well, resulting in a tight situation. From the beginning of the market, the Northern Ocean guild took the lead in making advances, followed by the Southern Ocean guild, so the trend slightly shifted, and with limited arrivals, confidence stabilized. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a tight situation. Unexpectedly, both the Northern and Southern Ocean guilds stopped, and only 1,405 packages were handled, and the purchase demand was difficult to loosen, which affected the market situation. Although sellers wanted to do well, they ultimately failed to reverse the situation, and all the good signs vanished. As a result, Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other varieties all showed a stable situation, and the market showed no upward or downward fluctuations. However, according to boatmen, it is currently the incense season, and they have a custom of traveling together to offer incense, so they have temporarily stopped transporting goods. In that case, according to this situation, the arrival volume in various ports will inevitably be scarce in the next few days. If sales can be strong, it will be optimistic. The overall trend of thick japonica rice in each guild was similar to the previous day. Du Yang tip and Yin Bian Yuan had no significant changes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 34 or 35 boats arrived from various ports downstream, and the sales of each guild were still good. The market for white japonica rice, Yang Du, Kejian, were steady, and the price of port-tip goods was tight by 3-5 fen due to scarcity. Early japonica rice was the same as yesterday, with no ups or downs. Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan were quite popular, and prices were stable.</p>
<h3>Small Refined Rice Waiting for Price to Sell</h3>
<p>Customers' Indica Rice Arrivals Already Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market was characterized by scarce arrivals from Hunan and Jiangxi, and other routes also declined. Due to the previous standstill of local customers, market prices were low, and customer traders were uniformly looking outward. Production prices in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces were high, making it even more difficult to agree on deals. On the sales side, there were few customers coming to the market due to the recent Spring Festival holiday, and the local street was also looking outward. There were few transactions throughout the day, and the market was temporarily stagnant. Yesterday, the market handled 405 packages of Fuzhou entertainment Nanjing Jixiang rice, over 200 packages of various brown rice, and Wenzhou handled 400 packages of Wuhu rice. Local streets handled over 300 packages of Jixiang, late brown rice, indica rice, etc. The market was high-quality, with some added charges because the owners raised prices due to reduced arrivals and rising production prices. For example, Wuhu Jixiang rice and Nanjing indica rice both rose by several fen. The foreign rice in the hands of foreign merchants has already been settled with the trade. The 35,000 packages of small refined rice stored in Anli were also sold out at a price of 6 yuan 5 jiao. However, traders are optimistic and mostly hoarding it. A small amount is allocated to the Ningbo guild. Now that tariffs are in effect, future prices are uncertain. With little stock in Shanghai, hoarders are optimistic. Yesterday, the local street handled 500 packages of recycled small refined rice, still opening at 6 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Rise Again by Two or Three Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market continued the momentum of the previous week and rose again by two or three fen. The reason is that the source is still not abundant, and the sales are continuous, and the confidence is turning firm. Yesterday, factories handled four vehicles of Bengbu beans, with a price of 2 yuan 5 jiao. They also handled three vehicles of Yingzhou beans, ranging from 2 yuan 6 jiao to 5 jiao 9 fen. Local streets purchased two vehicles of Feihe beans, with prices of 2 yuan 7 jiao 2 fen and 7 jiao. One vehicle of Yingzhou beans was also traded, with a price of 2 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen. More than 170 packages of Zhengyangguan beans were handled, with a price of 2 yuan 7 jiao 7 fen. There was also a vehicle of Zhengyang beans, with a price of 2 yuan 8 jiao, reportedly for export.</p>
