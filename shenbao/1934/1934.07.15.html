<p>— 敬</p>
<p>自軍縮會議無形停頓後。歐洲外交乃愈顯僵化法國之所謂安全保障德國之所謂軍備平等。莫不各衷其是而使時局深陷於窘境。各國執政當局卽不敢立卽出之以戰爭行爲。以求武力之解决。不又肯開诚布公。以謀永久之安定。於是乃相率運用縱橫捭闔之術。以同盟或恊商等名詞相勾結。意奥匃三國首相晤談之後。繼之以墨索里尼與希特勒之面商。未幾法外長巴爾都亦奔馳於波捷各國。以冀穩定法蘭西固有之覇權。頃者。巴氏又有倫敦之遊。英國對法態度。居然爲之一變。爲法國利益計。其功固有足多者。</p>
<p>然由另一方面觀察。在法國領導下之凡爾賽體。系已漸形搖動。卽如波蘭本爲法國之與國。法人助其獨立之動機。原在東制蘇聯。西抗德國。故波蘭立國之初。幾與法之保護國無異。矧德波之間。向有宿隙。民族之隔閡。［走廊］之糾葛。但澤自由巿之爭執。維斯特拉河航行權之齟　。在在使德波邦交。發生裂痕。詎知本年一月下旬。德波不侵條約。竟爾成立。彼此相約。今後十年内。對於任何問題。皆互相尊重對方之意見。决不以武力求解决。此其意義。不啻折毁法國十餘折來苦心經營之壁壘。轉而威脅其立國安全。固明眼人所共見也。巴爾都華沙之行。自在挽回此種危機。而重修法波之舊好。然波蘭爲其當前之切身利害及將來之發展計。勢亦不能不與德國相提携。法國有鑒於此。遂竭力聯絡蘇俄。以圖東歐方面之牽制。其意蓋謂法蘇而能一致。其他各小國自不能不追隨其後耳。所難者。法蘇同牀異夢根本矛盾並未消除卽令同盟成立。亦有隨時破棄之虞。不過在共同利害之下。彼此暫時利用而已。英國窺其隱衷。乃故持鎭。靜以觀變化。對意對德。各與週旋。以爲要挾法人之工具法國對英。旣莫測高深。而德意諒解之宣傳。尤足使其提心吊膽。设一旦德波聯盟之勢力。侵入烏克蘭境域。則多瑙河諸國。交受震撼。歐洲和平。必蒙感脅。斯法人之國難臨頭矣。</p>
<p>巴爾都倫敦之行。已向英政府明白解釋法蘇接近與夫訂結東歐互助交約之眞義。而竟獲得諒解。英法恊調之消息。遂傳播於遐邇。顧吾人鑒於英國與論之態度。仍覺英法恊調尙未至於訂結同盟條約之地步。外傳［他日不幸法國與德開戰英國願仍助法］之推測。殊嫌缺乏實際可信之根據。蓋英人審知今日之德意志旣無海外殖民地。又少根深蒂固之巿塲。外强中乾。决不能爲過度之發展縱有近代之工業技術。亦無所施展其長。惟法國則不然。法人在世界經濟恐慌中。受病最淺。國内國外猶多發展之餘地。且積蓄現金之多。允推歐洲第一。休戰以來恃凡爾賽體系之力量。在政治上復占特殊優勢如再加以蘇聯爲輔翼則老大之英帝國。更將自愧勿如。是以袒德抑法。爲戰後英國一貫之方針。今雖有巴爾都之解釋。而略變其多年之態度。究亦如吾人隔昨一評所述。出於一時利害之結合。未足以言和衷共濟也。帝國主義國家之行徑。純以私利爲指歸。本不能繩之以尋常之道義。英法固箇中之巨擘。更何能獨居於例外耶。</p>

<h3>希特勒未言外交　法報表示失望</h3>

<h3>視察各省財政</h3>
<p>據孔氏談、本人此次赴華北各省視察財政、行跡所經印象甚佳、而各地人民、對政府之好感尤爲欣慰、此行因時間怱促、綏遠等邊陲省份、不獲親往視察、引爲憾事、惟爲明瞭各省詳情計、凡本人未曾親到之地概派人員前往視察、俾知詳、情以作興革之參考、華北各省財政當局、對於全國財政會議所决議之案件、都能努力奉行、實爲可慰之事、至於各省市苛捐雜稅之廢除、自七月一日明令實行、已廢除者甚多、預計短時期内、可以完全廢除孔氏並謂、各省市苛捐雜稅各目之繁多、指不勝計、卽以山西一省、年可廢除苛捐雜稅達六百餘萬元之鉅、减輕人民之擔負不少云、</p>

<h3>科學靈乩與鬼神　丨答李甲生君丨</h3>
<p>［科學靈乩圖］在一兩月前曾風行了一下，但現在這種流行熱是漸漸冷淡下來了，大約很多人經上了當，而覺悟到那是騙人的東西了罷。雖然如此，它對於一般人的影響終於是很不小的，許多人現在仍半信半疑似的迷惑不解，例如現在還有李甲生君等就來信問到此事。他說他親自試騐過這靈乩，由這靈乩中叩問過去的事情，所答的一切都正確不誤。他覺行這眞是［神秘］而且［深奥］不用鬼神來解釋，則不能令人了悟其中的道理。</p>
<p>靈乩的原理，以前各報的附刋及雜誌上都有人談過，似乎我們現在不必多費筆墨。但現在還有人來問到這事，可知道定有很多人仍在盼望着解答，至少我們還得要做一番更淺近更明白的解答，使一般人都了解這幽靈的眞面目而不至爲所欺騙。</p>
<p>先講靈乩的原理。靈乩在一般人看來雖然神秘，但用心理學解釋起來，則是一件很平常很淺鮮的事。一句話：靈乩只不過是一種［無意識行爲。］所謂無意識行爲，就是人在不自覺中做出來的事。我們有很多行爲都是無心的，都是不自覺的。這種不自覺的行爲多半是由於習慣。倒如每天出街要關窗戶的人，日久以後他常常會有無意識中自然地去關了窗戶。又如我們走在路上，心裏可以只管想着其他的事情，而兩脚却能够很自然地走路，遇到轉灣時自能轉灣，遇到障碍時自能避開，無意中走了很遠［而自己一點也不覺得。對於一件事情過分地關心和注意時，也會發生無意識行爲，例如遊夢者的現象，能在半夜中走來將白日裏未曾做完的事做了，就是因爲他日裏對於這件事很關心的綠故。催眠術的秘訣，就在於設法使受施術者可以用自己的命令引起受術者的無意識行動。至於靈乩的原理，也是利用注意集中時的無意識行動。靈乩圖中央的碟子的移動，並不是眞的有幽靈來觸動了的，而是因爲扶乩者手指懸在碟底上半小時以後，一方面手臂已經酸麻而自然地戰動赴來，於是推動了碟，一方面因爲注意力已集中在靈乩圖上，自己的手臂推動了碟子而自己却不知道，反以爲是碟子自己動的。至於以後的請鬼談話，及詢問事情等，也仍是無意識行動之結果。李君說詢問過去的一切事情都正確無誤，這是因爲過去的一切事情在李君們的心中已經先有了成竹，一七解答都是李君們自己做出來的，不過李君們不自覺罷了。並且，靈乩能正確地告訴我們的，也僅只是過去的事情，對於未來的事情，靈乩的解答是完全靠不住的。的一個孕婦問自己將來生男還是生女，靈乩上答說生男，而實際後來却生女。這是因爲那婦人的生男孩的希望無意中表現在靈乩上的緣故，决不是鬼來騙了她！此外如打航空奬劵及花會等，也有人曾詺問過號碼，也無一人不是失敗！靈乩圖的欺騙性，到這裏是很可以明白了的。</p>
<p>鬼神是没有的，的科學常識的人對於這事都用不着再疑慮了，費爾巴哈說，［神是人創造出來的，］中國的俗語也說：［疑心生暗鬼］，鬼神是社會上的一部份特權者欺騙民衆的工具，民衆受了騙，便以爲自己的命運是操諸鬼神，而不知道自己的痛苦的社會的根源，而不能正視地去觀察社會，現在的民衆不應該再受社信的愚弄，不應該再安於命運的支配，應該以科學的眼光觀察自己的周圍，去來自己的眞正的出路了。</p>
<p>在現在經濟恐慌的時代裏，大多數的人都苦於生活没有出路，解决大衆生活的唯一方法，只有看清楚了這社會，而以積極的態度對付一切，但一部份人不能認識到這一點，他們貪安逸，圖僥倖，於是航空奬劵，打花會等就成爲他們最好的生活解决法。不錯，一中就是幾萬元，怎麽不好呢？但是可靠性呢！簡直等於大海裏去撈針，於是很多人仍然苦於没有把握。科學靈乩圖就抓着人們有這個　點而大踏步地走來，向人們寫包票，說是一定可以預先知道頭奬的號碼。中奬心切的人，於是就爭着購買靈乩圖，也爭着購買航空劵，但結果有誰眞的中了奬呢？我們就從求没有見過。</p>
<p>希望僥倖的人是最可憐的，他們受了欺騙和蹂躪而不自知。我們要不蹈覆轍，只有認眞地從科學的研究中去認識世界，認識社會。同時要看清所谓科學靈乩圖只是在科學的假招牌之下騙人的迷信一工具。</p>

<h3>理想和意志</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>人類有了種種的理想，然後有種種的新發明，新建設，所以能夠造成今日光明燦爛的世界。倘使人類没有了理想，那裏有什麽新發明，新建設呢？</p>
<p>雖然吾們有了很偉大的理想，但是不肯切切實實的去幹，結果也只有空想幻想夢想罷了！</p>
<p>小朋友呀！你有理想嗎？你的理想要它實現嗎？假使你的理想要實現的话，應當堅决你的意志起來，向你理想的途徑進取，那麽才能實現你的理想。</p>
<p>小朋友呀！你們還記得嗎？從关斯巴達國裏有一位少年對他母親這様說：［我這劍：［劍過短，可以自己變它長］以事實上看起來並没有什麽奇怪，不過自小就養成它創造的精神和强固的意志，這是吾們所應當知道。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友呀！倘使你們有了創造的精神，强固的意志，那麽你們的理想，怎様不會成功事實呢？</p>
<h3>曾文正是由實行新生活成就的</h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>曾文正公道德功業，書法文章，是人人都知道很好的，推尋他所以有這様偉大的建樹，確是由實行新生活上得來。</p>
<p>曾文正幼時，五歲讀書，九歲卽將五經熟讀完畢，在那時還没有小學敎科書，可是五經上所說的敎人方法，他肯照着去做，十五讀周禮儀禮，所以對於禮節又很注重，可見他在兒童時代，就已一習之的素了。</p>
<p>怎麽見得他是實行新生活呢！不好像附會其說嗎？有個證據，呌做名副其實啊。</p>
<p>曾文正名國藩，這國藩兩字，取義是［爲國屏藩］，就是立志將來要替國家做番事業，二十一歲改稱外號曰滌生，他自己說：滌字取滌去舊染之污，生字取明朝袁了凡說的［從前種種，譬如昨日死，從後種種，譬如今日生，［我們看他解釋滌生意義，正與現在新生活三字恰相符合，不過當時没有這新知活的名词吧了。</p>
<p>人難免無過，如果覺悟到自己做的不對，就要立刻改變過來，好像很髒的東西，極力洗刷，纔能除舊更新：又好像死去復生，不再蹈從前死路覆轍，向着光明路上進行：所謂［有則改之，無則加勉，］這様實行新生活，德業自有成就了。</p>
<p>小朋友，體味滌生兩字，對於衣食住行上時時省察，作爲好榜様，實行新生活，也預備做個國家屏藩，挽救國家的危局。</p>
<h3>手和腿</h3>
<p>— 劉堯通</p>
<p>我們都有兩隻手：</p>
<p>不要把它藏進袖，</p>
<p>自己的事自己做，</p>
<p>不靠父母和朋友。</p>
<p>臂膀粗得像樹幹，</p>
<p>拳頭大得好如斗，</p>
<p>刀槍武技練得熟，</p>
<p>將來長大報國仇。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>我們有了兩條腿，</p>
<p>不要常常翹上檯，</p>
<p>賽跑跳高多練習，</p>
<p>肌肉練得像鐵塊。</p>
<p>認清目的快步走，</p>
<p>不怕路上多阻碍。</p>
<p>處處應該搶先頭，</p>
<p>不達目的不回來。</p>
<h3>怎様注意夏令衛生</h3>
<p>— 日召</p>
<p>小朋友們，夏天是蒼蠅蚊子橫行的季節，我們偶不小心，便要生病的。與其生病後吃那酸苦的藥水，還不是預先來當心一下好些，下面幾項便是我們天天要實行的。</p>
<p>（一）衣服衣服最好是白顏色，因爲白色是驅逐日光的。並且每天至少要換一身，不可任它汗濕漉漉地穿在身上。</p>
<p>（二）食物油不要多吃，最好吃素菜，但不可過飽。隔夜的食物不吃。外面街頭的冷飲品不吃。飲冷開水最佳。</p>
<p>（三）居住窗戶宜常開，使空氣暢流。陰溝及其他污穢的地方須常臭藥水，夜裏不可露宿。</p>
<p>（四）洗浴夏天洗浴至少每天一次，宜用温水洗，洗過浴後必須用乾手巾摩擦揩乾。</p>
<p>（五）其他午後最適宜於午睡片刻，傍晚略爲散步。出門時要帶草帽，不可赤身露體。</p>
<h3>簡易的氣球</h3>
<p>— 子凈</p>
<p>哈哈丨這個氣球我時常做着玩的，做法極其容易，所以命名簡易的氣球。小朋友們，倘使你們有暇，可在空廣地方做一個玩玩。</p>
<p>用品：機連紙，竹簽，細鐵絲，破絮，桐油。　　製法：用機連紙（一圖）様剪下若干塊，可任意放大。剪成後，用麫糊粘之，不使漏縫，（如二圖）在下面用竹簽打一環，（如球口大）粘在紙球口上：再用鐵絲打成一網，（照二圖）按在球口竹簽上：再以破絮合桐油相裹，在網中取火燃之，用二人持正。若稍偏，則易於燃燒，過片刻，球内黑氣彌滿，手一放，則可漸漸上升。</p>
<h3>頑皮的王兒</h3>
<p>— 景元</p>
<p>王兒的爸爸買許多玩具給他，來試騐一下看哈哈！快要裝好了。</p>
<p>啊喲！我的烟斗到哪兒去啦！</p>
<h3>腦力的保護方法</h3>
<p>— 靈</p>
<p>小朋友：你們的腦力一定很靈巧的，但有幾位小朋友恐怕有些不及你們，那末靈巧的小朋友要永遠保護好靈巧，我把保護腦力的方法來告訴你們，以免腦力的衰弱。</p>
<p>精神不可時常動怒，因爲動怒後，血液流入腦中是很容易傷腦的，顶好時常心氣和平。</p>
<p>出門必須要戴帽子或張傘，因爲日光直射頭腦也是容易傷腦的：酒與更容易傷腦，應當一輩不喝不吸。</p>
<p>以上都是保護腦的好方法，小朋友：你們現在年紀尙輕，腦力又是最靈敏的時期，那末常常利用這保護方法，直到成人時代一定有科學的頭腦，就可發明種種的利器，去打倒中華的大仇敵了。</p>
<h3>魚類爲什麽能浮沉游泳</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>鯽，　，　，鱸，　等魚類，在水中游來游去，游上游下，活潑自由，十分快樂。譬如咱們小弟弟，小妹妹，小朋友，一隊隊在公園裏游行。都是吸自由的空氣，享自由的幸福，人與魚是一般的快樂吓。</p>
<p>但，咱想：人的行走奔跑，是靠着兩隻脚的。魚呢：尾鰭是舵，胸鰭腹鰭是槳：前進用槳：轉方向用舵：魚和舟的所以能在水裏進行，確是一般的原理。丨丨本來古時候的人見了魚類的游行，方纔發明船的。近代的飛機，便是見了飛鳥而發明的。小朋友！咱們還有甚麽東西，　可以發明呢？</p>
<p>鰭是魚類游行和傢伙，爲什麽魚類能够浮沉水中，忽上忽下呢？有時候。頭浮水面，尾沉水中。有時候，尾浮水面，頭竄水底。上下浮沉，都極便利，這是什麽緣故？</p>
<p>咱們試把魚腹剖開，除了腸胃以外，不是還有一個銀白色的胞嗎？這東西名呌做［鏢］，便是魚類沉浮上下的傢伙鏢分前後兩部，每部是皮質的長圓球體，中貯空氣。浮的時候，鏢中空氣飽滿。魚遂上浮水央。空氣從鏢中放了出來，魚遂下沉水中了。倘要頭向上而尾向下，那末，鏢的前部，滿貯空氣，後部空氣放出。倘要頭向下而尾向上，那末，鏢的後部，滿貯空氣，前部空氣放出。這様的方法，魚類便活潑自由地浮沉上下了。</p>
<p>咱們帶了滿貯空氣的大皮囊，雖然不會游水有人，也决不會沉入水底去，也是這個道理。</p>

<h3>防霉和防蠹</h3>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>小朋友：在霉天的時候，想你們家裏，多小都有一點藏儲的書本：你們最好在晴天的時候，反藏儲的書本搬出來，放在太陽下面曬曬，</p>
<p>曬好之後，再用［碎樟腦］（藥房裏有賣的）少許，夾在書本裏。這様：藏儲的書本，在霉裏就可以不霉不蠹。原因是：霉菌必须附生在潮濕的地方，乾燥地方霉菌是不能生活：當你曬書的時候，陽光已經把書本裏的水份蒸去，書本就很乾燥：再經你放進樟腦，樟腦是能殺蛀蟲的：所以霉菌和蛀蟲，都不能侵佔你的書本，因此你的書本就得完全無慮。本是！你不能因此一勞而永逸。因爲時間長久，乾燥的物件，就要因空中氣候關係而轉變潮濕：並且樟腦在長久時間的過程中，也要失其效用。所以你也要時常檢閱一下，而加以注意。</p>
<p>（附白）小朋友：如果你們的書本，已經發現被霉被蠹：你們可以趕快的照上法做去，不要抱消極的主義。因爲［亡羊補牢］總比［失之再失］來得穩妥適當。。</p>
<h3>花樹分栽的方法</h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們！你們歡喜樹木花草嗎？要是歡喜的話，不妨在你們的校園中，或是家中的隙地上，多種一些。等到樹木長大了，花朶開放了，自種自栽的東西，一旦得了成績，眞呌你萬分的歡喜。</p>
<p>有些植物用它種子來種，那是便當的事，這裏不用我數說了。有些植物是用枝條來扦栽的，那倒並不是一件容易的事。我現在有一些小小的經騐，貢獻給諸位，這是我實騐得來的，不妨去試騐一下。</p>
<p>各種樹木，在冬令把它枝條截下，丨過嫩過老者没有丨倒插在沙土混和的細土中：常受日光照晒，最好不要給霜雪壓着。等到春分時節，把這倒插的枝條，順栽在泥土中，卽會抽芽生葉。</p>
<p>玫瑰，薔薇等，最好也在春分前分栽。把不嫩不老的枝條截下，插在整個的甘　内，一併種在土中，常澆以水，不易夭折。</p>
<p>梔子花折下，不要便　在土内。把它插在花瓶中供養，只要瓶水不涸，它自會生出鬚根來，花謝後埋入土中，自易生長。</p>
<h3>小笑话</h3>
<p>— 苦學生</p>
<p>（一）一百分</p>
<p>用罷晚餐，和志明同學在操塲上散步，他報告今天月考的成績，他說：［我今天考得一百分。］人聽了他的話，便很愉快的問他：［是那一科功课？］他很快的回答我說：［當識五十分，國語五十分，相加起來，不是恰恰一百分麽］？</p>
<p>（二）誰是世界上最誠實的人？</p>
<p>兄問：［弟弟！你曉得世界上最誠實的人是誰？</p>
<p>弟答：［哥哥！在街上賣臭豆腐乾的人是最誠實的。］</p>
<p>兄弟進一層問道：［你怎様曉得他是最誠實的人呢？］</p>
<p>弟又答道：［因爲他的豆腐乾是臭的，他賣的時候，不是大聲的喊着臭豆腐乾麽？這就是不騙人的鐵證，所以我稱贊他是世界上誠實的人啊］！</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>太陽漲紅着面龐兒，斜走下去：這時，屋角簷頭，有三兩個蜘蛛，正從肚皮裏拉出絲來，運用它靈活的八隻脚兒，打了幾個圓圈，一個八卦形的網就張好了，它威風凛凛地站在當中：好像八卦陣的主帥。</p>
<p>但，蜘蛛雖然是一個昆蟲，它很有毅力。如果，做網的時候，逢着呼呼的大風。細微的絲，經不起風吹，就斷了。蜘蛛是不顧有的：只是認着［苦幹］可以戰勝一切：於是斷了再做，再斷再做：最後，還是它苦幹得勝，仍舊張了八卦網，自己做了主帥。不過，一陣大雨來了，總是被打得落花流水，再無立足之地。然而，烏黑的雪兒推開以後，它又在</p>
<p>經營撲滅飛蟲的陣壘。</p>
<p>蜘蛛爲什麽這様辛辛的幹呢？朋友！它們和我們人顃一様地［生存競爭］啊它們擺下八卦陣，不知有多少在天空裏自由飛舞的小蟲，活潑潑地陷在網裏，做主帥的飯菜。</p>
<p>許多害蟲，被它殺掉，固然是應當的：而它遇到益蟲像蜻蜓之類，仍照常殺害，只知是果腹的食科，所以親善的和平的中國人，怪不得被日本人欺侮了。</p>
<h3>木箱中的鳥和魚</h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>一隻空的木箱内，吊着有五磅重。如果裏面放着小鳥，不住地飛來飛去，那上面的磅針，是否仍舊指着五磅嗎？假使這隻木箱盛滿了水，有十五磅重，後來又放一尾魚進去，水仍舊滿着，魚兒不住的在水中游泳，磅有否增加？</p>
<p>小朋友，你們看了左面的圖，就可以明白啦。鳥在箱内，雖不停住在箱上：但是它飛的時候，兩隻冀翅向下拍着，空氣的壓力便增大了，因此磅上的重量也加增而不止五磅。魚兒在水中却有些不同。物理學上阿幾米得的定理告訴我們說：［水有浮力，水中的東西的重量，和排去水的重量恰巧相等。］所以魚兒的木箱仍舊是十五磅啊！</p>

<p>對于上述三種的基本規律丨就是、雙足和球的飛程成平行綫、足跟不落地、和膝部微灣丨明瞭以後、現在再回頭來研究雙足的部位與網的關係、球的飛程和良好拍撃時、身軀應取的部位、要行動迅速、必須用你所要移動的方向較遠地一足推動、所以雙足和網成平行綫時、對于向左右的移動、就來得很快、因爲一足或他足總是在相對的地位、並且當要行動迅速時、其中一足自然就可做支柱、但是實際上足部的向前向後或向斜面的移動、須要的時候、一様很多、此時若是雙足平立、就失去了支柱、不能迅速的移動、向前或向後、是要很快地將一足移在另一足的前或後、然後身體才能實際向前或向後移動、由此看來、在撃球以前、雙足和網球成斜綫是最妥當的地位、對于正手或反手拍撃、足部要移動得很快、所、以雙足平立是阂不能成功的、有經騐的球員、並不須要奔跑去應付那可以及得到的來球、他們總是等來球飛近身旁時、祗要將足部很快地踏在適當的地位、就能應付自如、因爲雙足斜立着、前後左右就絶對不受拘束、毫不空費時間、而足部的移動又很快、這是很重要的一點、</p>
<p>若是球向右旁來、那當然是要用正手拍、撃此時來球的躍力强、則將右足移在左足的後面、來球的躍力弱、則左足移向前反而言之、球向左旁來、那當然是要用反手拍撃、如是右足移向前去應付短躍的球而左足移向後去應付長躍的球、當向前拍撃時、身軀應自臀部轉動、並且隨着球拍的頭部向前迎撃來球、藉以增加撞撃的力量、當球拍向後擺動時、全身重量集於右足和腿、腿再順勢向前拍撃、移重量到左足、（此係就正手拍撃而言、反手拍撃、時兩足相返球拍仲到盡端、但是仍要保持着球員身體的平衡、</p>

<h3>紀念先烈秋瑾女士</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>讀本報本月六日安慶專巿，知道安徽省於是日在省黨部舉行徐錫麟殉國二十七週紀念，並由省府規定每年七月六日，爲安慶紀念日。因這尊崇先烈的消息，不禁爲九泉下的徐烈士慰，然同時也便爲另一烈士傷。</p>
<p>另一烈士爲誰，無用說，就是秋瑾女士。</p>
<p>秋女士與徐烈士，志趣同，謀略同，舉動同，就義的關係亦同，然而一則萬人爲之傾觴，一則僅有亂草在　門披離，這對照怎能呌人無憾？</p>
<p>秋女士一生事蹟，照昭在人耳目，她的孤墳，能使湖山壯色，但現在墳旁的風雨亭，已爲風雨摧拆，徒使行人生落寞之感。記得浙省先烈：陳其美先生的銅像，在杭州湖濱公園，巍然獨立，朱執信先生的紀念日，全省各機關，都舉行紀念儀式，先烈爲國捐軀，本不計身後的尊榮，然而吾人立於尊重先烈的精神的觀點上，實覺像秋女士其</p>
<p>人，大可和其他烈士一様，給她規定一個紀念日，得領受人們地的景仰與愛戴。</p>
<p>本刋本期出版之日，正是秋女士就義紀念日（舊歷六月六日之前兩日，特具短稿數篇，聊表紀念之微意亦所以鼓厲我女界同人，共知嚮往之道去云爾。</p>
<h3>紀念秋瑾女俠感言</h3>
<p>— 濟羣</p>
<p>二十七年前的今日是鑑湖女俠秋瑾女士被逮之日。秋女士生存着的國家是强隣逼處内政腐敗的滿清帝國：秋女士所處的社會是封建思想的社會：秋女士所處的家庭是宗法的舊式家庭，而秋女士却能超越一切，爲着家庭革命，種旋革命，以至於社會革命而死。不獨她的犠牲精神足以廉頑立懦，就以她的才識思想論，也是歷史上不可多得的人才，我們今日紀念她，應該認識她的地方的下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，女士於女學未興時，處在舊式的家庭裏，能不爲宗法思想所呑噬，而於攻讀舊籍乏外，博覧中外書報，且能吸收各方面的思想以完成自己的革命主張，這種好學深思的精社實在是難能可貴。</p>
<p>第二，女士旣婚於王姓，且生子女，因感男女不平等的痛苦，而能不爲封建思想所不縛，不顧一切地脫離家庭，隻身留學海外，並毅然加入中山先生所創之同盟會，與諸同志從事於革命事業，此種勇敢的革命精神，不獨爲一般女子所難能，即號稱革命家者亦不易爲。</p>
<p>第三，女士從日本回國以後，因欲拯救二萬萬婦女於男權壓迫之下，特創設中國女報，主辦明道女學，以求婦女眞正的解放；同時主持徐錫麟所創辦的大通體育會。編光復軍及敢死隊，以行動領導革命。此種實事求事的奮鬥精神，决非一般空談解放和革命者可比。</p>
<p>從上面的事實看來，我們知道女士的人格是偉大的。見識是卓越的，思想是先進的，行動是勇邁的，女士之實行革命，是希望推翻腐敗的滿清政府，而求達到昌明的政洽及合理的社會。女士之提倡女學，主張男女平權，是欲使女子有求學及自立的機會，而求達到與男子平等的地位；且謂事業艱鉅必數十年後始可達到目的。果然在二十餘年後的今日，女學是盛行了，男女是平權了；然而女子的人格如何，地位如何，能力又如何？只看到各學校裏每年造出六批地能消費不能生產的［方帽］架子；只看到各種報紙上披露着强姦，遺棄，自殺，要求膽養費等等不展進的消息！欲求如秋女士之努力改造個人環境，社會環境以及國家環境的人才，以我見聞之狹隘，似乎還不曾發現過。這是值得婦女界的人們去深切地反省丨丨尤其是在紀念秋女士的今日！</p>
<h3>關於詩人的秋瑾</h3>
<p>— 重痕</p>
<p>秋瑾本是一位詩人，然而她的詩人的地位，却爲她的事業所掩。我們只要把秋瑾一生的行逕加以解剖時，便可以看出她是無處不流露着詩人的氣分的。她的好俠，她的慷慨悲歌，她的不安於她原來的身世·都證明她具有羅曼諦克的詩人本質。不消說她受犠牲時那段遺話，那段用［秋雨秋風愁煞人］一句詩來代替口供的遺話，更把她詩人的生命充分地顯示了出來。</p>
<p>秋瑾生值滿清末葉，她的時代正是帝國主義開始伸手到中國的時候，也正是時中國民族思想開始睜眼的時候。她的時代中一串的事變是：中日戰爭丨戊戍變政丨庚子之亂。這必然地使她敏感到非起來推翻統治階級不可。而身處辛亥革命前夜的她，更受了當時實際運動的推動，愈是要起來作：救亡：的工作。這様，便形成了她的革命生活，同時也就產生了她詩歌上的絶唱。</p>
<p>她的詩在中國一向少數的女詩人中可以說是特出又特出的。我們只要一翻閱她的遺集，便可以發現在她的詩詞之中</p>
<h3>秋瑾女士的生平略述</h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>秋瑾女士自就義迄今，已整整二十七年，她的一生行事，都成了昭然的史蹟；然而本刋的編者，以爲秋女士的精神丨丨革命的清神，大或重新表張一番，故此在她就義的紀念日將近之前，囑我寫成此稿　不幸秋女士殉國之日，我遠在僻遠的深山中與羣兒嬉戲，她的音容行狀，絲毫也未識得。數年前旅杭，和秋女士的高足徐小淑女士時相過從，才得了一些梗概。</p>
<p>秋女士名瑾。安璿卿，自號鑑湖女俠，浙江山陰縣人。她父親是個官僚，生她於福建；後來又調往湖南，便把她許配給湘潭富紳王某爲媳，生子女各一。她和姓王的住在北京多年，戊戍之變，庚子之亂，給了她無限的刺激：她便想突出閨房，突出家庭，而把兩肩肩起救國的重任。她這時在一首［滿江紅］的詞裏，這般寫着：</p>
<p>小住京華，早又是中秋佳節。爲籬下黃花開遍，秋容如拭。四面　殘終破楚，八年風味從思浙。苦將儂强派作蛾眉，殊未屑。身不得，男兒列，心卻比，男兒烈。平生肝胆，因人常熱。俗子胸襟誰識我？英雄末路當磨折。莽紅塵何處覓知音？靑衫濕。</p>
<p>在她那仕宦人家的社交範圍以内，當然都是些味着良心，安富尊榮的俗子，那裏還有以國家興亡爲懹的人物？所以她不得不深嘆［莽紅塵何處覓知音］，而至於痛哭流涕，靑衫濕盡了。</p>
<p>但是時候到來，她終於决心突破這平庸昏暗的環境，突破舊禮敎下婦女雌伏的藩籬；她遠走高飛，到日本求學去了。</p>
<p>事情是這様發生的；光緖三十年某月，一位革命的新人，在北京被捕下獄。大家知道清朝的衙禁，多少地方是可以用金錢通融。我們這位熱心國事，愛慕革命的秋女士，她的因人常熱的肝胆，竟然大大地　沸騰；她解下自己的簪佩私自爲那不相識的囚客，寄出六百元出獄的運動費。這事引動了姓王的的怒火，兩人大閙起來，她便棄家走上赴日本的輪船。姓王的急得追到船塢，向她索取王家的什物，她將唯一的行李的錦被。從船頭抛下，這様，便呼吸了太平洋新鮮的空氣。　這時孫中山先生正在日本東京組織同盟會，秋女士首先加入。她並介紹了許多江浙的同志入會。每當集會之時，她必然登壇痛快淋漓地演說一番，鼓吹革命，就這様使得清廷不安，暗地裏呌日人設法禁止。日人從新訂一種取締留學的規則，大部分的留學生，都憤慨地歸國，秋女士自是其中之一。王家有父親聽見她已返國，定要她回到湖南</p>
<p>：她因黨军經濟困難，就也將計就計。到了那兒，她假稱在外面負了很多有　，那老人統都給了她，不過對於她的行動，卻防範得十分嚴密。</p>
<p>一天，她說要到廟裏去看戲，家人見她把兒女穿着得整整齊齊，帶了同去，就也不生疑。豈料她坐着轎子到了戲塲，把小孩安置在戲台上，竟自鴻飛冥冥了。</p>
<p>回到江浙，在南潯的潯溪女學敎書。不久又到了上海，主持同盟會的通信機關，并常製造炸藥：一次藥性爆裂，幾遭危險。同時又發刋中國女報，裏面一篇發刋辭，眞做得鏗鏗鏘鏘，鬼神感泣。光緖三十三年，回紹興主持明道女學：因爲徐錫麟已經懷志入了安徽，他在紹興所辦的大通體育會，全部委託給秋女士。這會有内容，純是籌備革命軍事，編定［光復漢族，大振國權］八軍，呌做光復軍。這年五月，大致已經練成，專等徐錫麟在安徽起事，她便在浙江響應。</p>
<p>五月二十五日，徐錫麟在安徽刺殺巡撫恩銘，事敗被殺。這時風雨滿城，秋女士呌同黨暫時避開，自已還留在大通校内。六月五日夜，終於被奸人的告發而被捕。初時關在山陰縣署，因無口供，知事李鍾獄不予處决：紹興知府貴福大怒，李知事乃將全案送給府尹，自己上吊自殺。</p>
<p>秋女士平日善於掩護，所以和貴福來往甚密。當晚貴福親自審她，問她有無同黨，她說［有］：貴福問是誰，她說［就是你］。貴福駭得不敢再問，於是交給她紙筆，呌她寫供狀：她提起筆來但寫了［秋雨秋風愁殺人］的那句名詩。六月六日黎明前三時，被殺於紹興府的軒亭：沸騰騰的熱血，隨着漫漫長夜，灑在冷酷如秋的靑鋒之下　年僅三十三歲。</p>
<p>她没有眼見滿清的覆亡，没有參與辛亥革命的勳功，然而她的血可是白流了的嗎？譚嗣同先生在戊戍政變之後，事肯學康梁輩的逃亡，當時他有一句名言，說是［幾曾見有不流血而能成功大改革的先例？］的確，他們諸位先烈折流血，正是辛亥革命成功的先聲。</p>
<p>有人以爲秋女士僅僅止於種族革命，殊引爲恨事。其實這於秋女士没有損害。一時代的人物，但求他能做到那一時代的先驅，不能苛求他做隔代以後的先驅。秋女士若生於今日，她將另有一種思潮：試看她的［同胞苦］一歌，雖在集中於種族革命的思想之日，已能注意到政治社會的各方面。原歌凡四首，現錄兩首如下：</p>
<p>同胞苦，同胞之苦苦如苦黃連。壓力千斤難自便，鬼神號泣實堪憐。吁嗟乎！地言虐政猛如虎，何日復見不平年？聲卡遍地如林立，巡丁司事億萬千。兇如豺狼毒如蛇，一見財物口流涎。我今必，必，必興師，掃蕩毒霧見靑天。乎提白刃覓民賊，捨身救民是聖賢。</p>
<p>同胞苦，同胞之苦苦如苦黃連。鞕笞同胞同犬馬，民賊自待若神仙。烟膏有捐酒的捐，房捐舖捐無不全。襪履之微皆取捐，一草一木不寛便。我今必，必，必興師，掃蕩毒霚見靑天。手提白刃覓民賊，捨身救民是聖賢。</p>
<p>她的一生，在行動方面，是突破舊家庭，突破舊禮敎，進而謀打倒昏暗的異族的統治，使祖國日漸繁榮。在文學方面，也有很大的建樹，她是打破明清以來一般人的專找一些陳辭腐字，拚命地穿，或塡，以成爲詩詞的陋習，她的遺作，全是創造，全都勃勃有生氣。總觀她短短的生涯，各方面都盡了最大有努力，各方面都表現了革命的精神。</p>
<p>今日又是舊歷的六月四日，立在秋女士就義紀念日的前夜，想見她那吟着［秋雨秋風愁殺人］的絶句慷慨激昂以赴刑塲的神情，能不令人揮拳起舞，髮指目皆，只想朝着她所遭逢的那種惡勢力，黑暗圈，而往前衝，衝呢？</p>
<p>，除了前期不多的有幾首是純吟咏個人的傷感以外，其他大部分的詩詞却都是溢滿着革命的熱潮。她的詩歌的美錦大體是由兩種思想所織成：第一種是民族思想，第二種是女權思想。丨而這兩種思想也就正是她的時代中的最偉大有產物。</p>
<p>我以爲要談秋瑾的詩時，必須要明白她詩中所包含的這兩種思想。因爲，這纔是秋瑾的眞價值，纔是秋瑾之所以爲秋瑾。</p>
<p>可惜手頭没有一秋瑾女俠遺集］，只能憑記憶把她的名句錄出一些如下：</p>
<p>（一）關於民族思想的　煉石無方乞女媧，白駒過隙感韶華。瓜分慘禍依眉睫，呼告徒勞費齒牙。祖國陸沉人有責，天涯飄泊我無家。一腔熱血愁回首，腸斷難爲五月花。</p>
<p>聞道當年鏖戰地，至今猶帶血痕流。馳驅戎馬中原夢，破碎河山故國羞。領海無權悲索寞，磨刀有日快恩仇。天風吹在冷然過，十萬雲烟眼底收。</p>
<p>莽莽神州嘆陸沉，救時無計媿偷生。搏沙有愿興亡楚，博浪無錐撃暴秦。國破方知人種賤，義高不碍客　貧。經營恨未酬同志，把劍悲歌涕淚橫。</p>
<p>·曰歸也歸何處？猛回頭，祖國鼾眠如故。外侮侵陵，内容腐敗，没個英雄作主。天乎太瞽：看如此江山，忍歸胡虜？豆剖瓜分，都爲我故土。</p>
<p>（二）關於女權思想的</p>
<p>何人慷慨語同仇，誰識當年郭解流？時局如斯危已甚，閩裝願爾換吳鈎。　骯髒塵寰，閩幾個男兒英哲？算只有蛾眉隊裏，時聞傑出：良玉勛名襟上淚，雲英事業心頭血。醉摩挲長劍作龍吟，聲悲咽。自由香，常思爇：家國恨。何時泄？觀吾儕今日，各宜努力。振拔須思安種類，繁華莫但誇衣玦，算弓鞋三寸太無爲，宜改革！</p>
<p>期君力挽頽風，化痼學應隆。伏燦花蓮舌，啟瞆震聲聾。喚起大千姊妹，一聽五更鐘！</p>
<h3>秋瑾女士遺像</h3>
<h3>論婦女（續）</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　樊基譯</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>在［文化有晨曦］，女性的勞動經騐，較之男性的經騐要複雜得多，女性不僅在社會上等於男性的合作者，而且在智慧上也超過於男性。所以，在歷史上某一時期，家庭，民族，甚至部落中的權力是屬於女性的。古代希臘的作家說：西徐亞和斯拉夫民族中有一種女性公社，獨的土地和其他財產。無疑的，這種情形，在［野蠻人］所保存的母系血族制［（此種母系血族制至十九世紀還是有的）中亦有之，如帝俄時威爾霍恩斯克的貴族。從俄羅斯古話中，也可看出斯拉夫人的這種女性公社之存在，這個古話說，有個依里其人者，與他的兒子相遇，但兒子不承認父親，後由母親指出一記號，兒子才認識了。亞馬孫族的傳說也說：古代塞爾維亞的［亞歷山大］女英雄故事，調在亞立山大·馬其頓的軍隊中有女騎士隊伍。捷克人的古傳也說，在八世紀時，女子曾殺死自己的丈夫，堅守在高山上，與男子相繼戰爭七年。俄國的傳說中，也的好多女英雄的故事。關於女性的聰敏，她們征服大自然力量，如［瓦西里女聖人］等等故事，各民族的民歌中都是有的。［女預言家，］所謂神巫，女仙等等，都可以歸於這一類的。凡此種種都說，除了天然的驚異和長服女性的特殊能力外，男性在某一時期曾是女性爲主有社會，也許有些［戒律［是由婦女爲自衛和其他種種原因而設的，爲的防止在懐孕最後數月中男子的必的侵害，並限制［强性］的行動之自由。</p>
<p>話，傳說，保存下來的很多。從聖經上的亞當夏娃起，都異口同聲的說，女性爲惡魔工作，［不是由於驚嚇，而是由於良心，］她們没有任何圖利的目的，而是努力作惡於人類。浮士德與鬼訂約，欲返老還童，但女巫却未設法返回她的靑春和美容。所以女巫和妖術的研究者，都不注意這個莫名其妙的公平，雖然普通認爲女性欲永久成爲靑年，健康，美麗的志向，也是她們的毛病。</p>
<p>男性反對女性在家務和生活中支配地位的鬭爭，是與氏族的開始崩壞，氏族與家庭的開始對立，以及私有財產的發展同時發生的。男性薰陶於女性的統治下，有好幾千年，後來他逐漸脫離打臘者，而成爲一種工作者，始而爲女性工作的助手，繼而爲女性的同等工作者，最後，成爲耕作土地和製作資料的主要勞動力，尤其是在開始應用他們所馴養的牲畜轉運東西和耕地的時期。男性在本氏族内，旣不能娶妻在其妻子氏族内又不能作爲平等的社會上員的那種地位，與其在經濟中所起的作用遂不相適應了，所以，在以後數千年間，男性便進行頑强的鬭爭，主張男性爲一家之長：主張承認子女爲男性的子女，而下是生母的子女，子女應屬於父族，不能屬於母族：並主張承認私有財產爲男性的私有產和其一族的所有，而不是妻和妻族所有。這一鬭爭是非常嚴重的，因爲隨着勞動的發展，女性並不後於男性，而且她逐漸成爲更精巧，有經騐，有工作能力的了。男性方面所有的只是力量，他們的鬭爭，乃是奪取權力的鬭爭，其目的是在剝奪女性的生活經騐，而且終於達到了這一目的丨丨征服了女性，使［女性成爲男性的管家狗了］。</p>
<p>甚至男性使爐灶，也成爲本氏族的爐灶了。伯羅米亞由天上取火的神話，最初大概是由牧師所揑造的，它剝奪了女性發明取火之功績，不過以後這神話便成爲違反神意的了。</p>
<p>無中不會生有的，傳說上與女騎士作戰之事，雖不能像古傳上所說的那種形式，但是顯然總有某種方式的。［掠奪薩賓婦女］（意大利古代史上的故事），可以說是由於羅馬缺少女性，不僅因爲女性所以是女性有掠奪之必要，而且因爲女性會紡紗，織布，也有掠奪之必要。［拐引］女孩，大抵也可以偷竊隣家的優良女子充作奴婢的企圖說明之（未完）</p>
<h3>婦女小辭典</h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>婦女運動</p>
<p>［婦女運動］就是婦女爲企求掙脫數千年來社會所加於自身的種束縛，謀得人類的自由平等的奮鬭。依現在國際間一情勢分，大約有兩種不同的傾向：一是要求在現社會制度下，婦女能和男子一様，享受經濟上政治上社會上的平等權利丨丨換句話說，這傾向中的婦女，僅希望能把現狀改善，就可認爲滿足：一是認定婦女眞正的解放，面要把社社根本的改造了才能實現，因此，屬於這傾向中的婦女所用的手段，往往較前者急劇，而和在同傾向中的男子們堅　强地聯合在一起的。</p>
<p>婦女參政權</p>
<p>［婦女參政權］是指婦女在地主議會及國會中，有明文規定在法律上得享的和男子同様的選舉權及被選舉權而言。世界上最是賦與婦女參政權的是美利堅合衆國魏耀孟那Ｗyomng(ＵＳＸＡ）其後，爲國才相繼開放女禁，　說女性是女巫，妖術家，妖魔，惡魔的使者和奴役等故事，神</p>
<h3>男女自殺方法的不同</h3>
<p>— 英譯</p>
<p>丨丨英國學者的統計丨丨</p>
<p>男女的性格與感情，有相當的不同，我們很可在日常生活中看得出來，英國奇奥格爾克博士曾發表過去二十年間歐洲的男女自殺者所用的方法，其差别如左</p>
<p>方法　　男　　　　　女</p>
<p>縊死　　四一七　　二四０</p>
<p>投河　　一五二　　二六０</p>
<p>自戕　　二０七　　一二九</p>
<p>服毒　　七九　　　一四五</p>
<p>槍殺　　六七　　　二</p>
<p>躍下（從高處）二一　三六</p>
<p>輾死　　二四　　　　八</p>
<p>其他　　三三　　　一八</p>
<p>以上各就千人而言</p>
<p>照上面看來，男子妈縊死爲最多，女子以投河爲最多：槍殺和置身鐵道上的自殺，以男子居多，服毒和躍下而死的，以女子居多，縊死自戕和手槍自殺等，須相當凖備及伴着恐怖的心情的，大約爲女子所不很選用，反之，簡而易行的服毒投河等，似乎爲女子所樂于採取。</p>

<h3>我國蠶絲業的現况</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>我國是世界最古的蠶絲國。按理說，我國的蠶絲業應該比其他國家有特殊的進步纔對。可是細查近年來我國的蠶絲業史，事實却大謬不然。不但在對外輸出上逐漸減少，卽在生絲的出產上也大大的衰落下去。對外輸出自民國十八年的十八萬九千担（價值一億四千七百萬海關兩）减到民國二十一年的七萬八千担（價值僅三千二百萬關兩）。關於生絲產額，我國一向没有確實的統計，惟就最近數年我國繅絲業的頽敗和歷年出口的銳减以觀，也可知其大概了。</p>
<p>這種出口减少以及生產衰落，固然部份地是由於世界經濟恐慌所致，然而主要的原因却在於我國蠶絲生產技術的落後。在名義上，我國雖是最古的蠶絲國：可是在實質上現在所用的生產方法，却完全是跟隨着他國的步伐向前跑。</p>
<p>然而就在這［跟着跑］的問題上，依舊不免落後之感　。</p>
<p>我國蠶絲事業的發達當首推江浙。其次是川魯和皖鄂。江浙所產，以白廠經和輯里絲爲主，川魯則以黃絲爲主。高等白廠經在二十一年初還發現過一千兩以上的高價（以每担計算），可是到了二十二年，却始終盤旋於三元至七百元的市價中（只有七月曾發現八百元的市價）。然而在生產成本上呢，丨春繭要六百五十元，夏繭要九百五十元，秋繭要八百元。在這種情形之下，從事於蠶絲事業的只有蝕本而已。</p>
<p>關於輯里絲，四川黃絲以及山東黃絲的賣價與成本，也可依此類推。</p>
<p>這種市價狂跌的情形，一方面是因爲外銷的不振，一方面則是由於存絲過多所致。</p>
<p>其次，在繭價方面，亦復如此。在民國十八年以前，每担土繭尙值七八十元：可是到了最近，就是改良種也不過僅值四五十元，土種則僅值二三十元而已。</p>
<p>在這種情形下。前年政府雖有絲業公債之發行和江浙陳絲陳繭登記及推銷兩委員會之設立（陳絲陳繭經登記後，出口時每担由政府補助公債一百四十元，業豁免出品稅），然而因爲種種關係，却只補救了一部份的陳絲陳繭：至去年五月兩會結束以後，絲價和繭價又逐漸慘跌了，此後雖有去年二月間江浙蠶業聯合統制委員會以及今年二月間全國經濟委員會主持的蠶絲改良委員會之相繼出現，然而直至最近，尙無具體的成績表現出來。</p>
<p>綜觀我國近數年來蠶絲業的概况，我們可以說牠是步步慘跌。要挽救這步步慘跌的趨勢，我們以爲：第一，必須積極地從改良蠶種，改良生產技術着手。只有技術精良，品質優美，纔能在國際絲塲上和外貨竸爭。第二，在消極方面，不但要擴充海外市塲，在國内的銷路上也必須謀大量的開展。只有國骨絲織業發達，纔能消費多量的生絲：只有繅絲業發達，纔能消費多量蠶繭。</p>

<p>今年敎育部通令全國中等以上學校的學生軍，在今年暑假期内，一律須受三個星期極嚴格的軍事訓練。雖然似乎時機已經失去，但是還不失爲［亡羊補牢］之舉：所謂［十年敎訓］者是也。我的日記簿上因此平白地添上無數珍貴的材料。現在我且把這材料公開一下。</p>

<h3>Yongding River Flooding Causes Disaster; Qijia Village Residents Gather to Open Sluice Gates; Over Fifty Villages in Wuqing County Flooded; Mountain Torrent Erupts, Destroying Several Sections of Beining Railway Tracks at Liushouying</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Qijia Village control gate in the upper reaches of the Yongding River is a mechanism for managing silt discharge into the Hai River. On the 13th, the river level rose sharply. More than ten villagers from Qijia Village and other nearby areas went to the gatekeepers and demanded that they release water into the Bei Canal to prevent their villages from being flooded. The gatekeepers refused. At midnight, the villagers gathered and forcibly opened a section of the Dahe River, several tens of yards long, between Qianhou Dingzhuang, releasing water into the canal. The water between the Bei Canal and the Yongding River became vast and boundless. The Hai River Engineering Committee sent personnel to investigate on the 14th, and found that a disaster had already occurred and nothing could be done to remedy it. The only solution is to return the Yongding River to its original course and allow it to flow into the Hai River through the canal. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the heavy rainfall in the upper reaches, causing the river water to swell, over fifty villages in Wuqing County, including Liuhe Village, Dingping Village, and Majia Xiaozhuang Village, experienced seven breaches in the riverbanks. The floodwaters, reaching a depth of four feet, inundated everything. Transportation between Tianjin-Ping and Wuqing was completely cut off. The water level continues to rise. In southern Hebei, in areas like Guangzong, Hengshui, and Qingxian, there has been no rain for a long time, and the crops are withering from drought. The South Canal has become so shallow that the water is only about a foot deep, with the riverbed only a few feet deep, making it impossible for boats to navigate. Residents in these three counties are busy praying for rain. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 13th, the Beining Railway Bureau ordered a Tangshan engineering train to carry flood prevention tools to protect the Luan River railway bridge. The Luan River's</p>
<p>water continues to rise daily, and the bridge piers are being severely eroded, posing a considerable danger. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Qinhuangdao reported that the area north of Liushouying Station on the Beining Railway is part of the Jiaoshan mountain range. Due to continuous rain in various areas in recent days, a flash flood suddenly erupted from Jiaoshan on the 13th, with a torrent rushing downwards. The Liushouying railway tracks were directly in its path. Fortunately, the flood subsided quickly, but the tracks were nearly washed away. The station's engineering staff have been taking strict precautions. (14th Day Special Dispatch) (Beiping) In the Xuanhua area in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, there has been continuous heavy rain. The water levels at the Lugou Bridge, Jionglong Temple, and the measuring station have risen suddenly. At 2 PM, the water level reached 15 feet 5 inches, an increase of three feet compared to yesterday. The current is turbulent. The River Affairs Bureau has telegraphed all sections along the river to strengthen their defenses. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>PingSui Railway: Roadbed Washed Away by Flood; Northbound Train Stopped at Maidazhao Station</h3>

<h3>Setting Up Checkpoints at Various Great Wall Passes is Being Actively Prepared; Zhang, Gao, Yin, and Huo Hold Preliminary Discussions</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of setting up checkpoints at various Great Wall passes is currently being actively prepared. Zhang Yongnian and Gao Yuanji visited Yin Rugeng and Huo Shi this afternoon for preliminary discussions on the checkpoint issue. They decided to visit Gubeikou together in four or five days to inspect the area. After returning to Beiping, they will consult with Yin and Tao on the checkpoint issue. Huo Shi said, "I originally planned to leave Beiping today, but due to the rainy weather and muddy roads, I changed my plans to go to Miyun tomorrow to handle everything. I will wait for Zhang Yongnian and Gao Yuanji to arrive in Miyun and then go together. The Gubeikou office can allocate a portion of its existing space for the Gubeikou checkpoint, eliminating the need to find other houses. The checkpoints will be established starting from Gubeikou, followed by Xifengkou and other passes. The situation in Gubeikou is currently calm. The main export goods are foreign goods like kerosene and flour, while the main import goods are northeastern agricultural products like soybeans. These are domestic goods and should not be taxed. It is expected that the tax revenue from the established checkpoints will not be very high." (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yongnian telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report on the situation of his investigation at various Great Wall passes and the progress of his meetings with Japanese officials. The Japanese side has expressed great satisfaction with setting up customs. It is expected that the checkpoints at various passes will be formally established on the first day of next month. The import and export tax rates will be the same as the tariffs collected by domestic customs. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) The 18th Division in Yixi captured Xin Keming, the puppet provincial committee secretary of the Xiang-E-Gan region. He confessed that the Xiang-E-Gan army was originally the puppet 16th Army, later renamed the 16th Division, with Xu Yan just as the commander. The original three regiments were reduced to the 46th Regiment. Two regiments of the Red 3rd Division in eastern Hubei were annihilated by the National Army. The puppet 6th Army Corps' independent regiment was annihilated by the Yue and Tao divisions by one-half. There are still three independent regiments, each with 200 guns, and two independent battalions, totaling 300 guns. Including the guerrillas, there are fewer than 3,000 guns. The puppet 17th and 18th Divisions are in the puppet Xiang-Gan military region. Casualties and supplies cannot be replenished. More and more people are surrendering. The bandit leaders are panicked and are using every method to incite the people. The main force of the bandit army is developing towards the Wuning-Yongxiu-Nanxun road, attempting to connect with the Gan-Northeast bandits into one piece, adopting mobile warfare tactics, penetrating deep into the rear, and containing the National Army on the northern front. Because the Gan-E-Xiang area is between two major rivers and two major railways, it is of great importance to the survival of the puppet central government. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The National Army captured Baishui Town, 40 miles south of Guangchang, on the 10th, killing and capturing many bandits. The remaining bandits fled in disarray towards Zhong Sishi in the southwest and are currently being pursued. (14th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: An Analysis of the Conflicts in French and British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Since the indefinite suspension of the Disarmament Conference, European diplomacy has become increasingly rigid. Both France's so-called security guarantees and Germany's so-called arms equality are based on their own interests, plunging the situation into a difficult position. The ruling authorities of various countries dare not immediately resort to war to seek a military solution, nor are they willing to openly discuss ways to achieve lasting stability. Therefore, they are all using the art of strategic maneuvering, engaging in alliances or consultations. After the meeting of the prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, it was followed by the meeting between Mussolini and Hitler. Soon after, French Foreign Minister Barthou also traveled to various countries in Poland and Czech Republic, hoping to stabilize France's inherent hegemony. Recently, Barthou also visited London. Britain's attitude towards France has actually changed, which is indeed commendable for the benefit of France.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the Versailles system under the leadership of France has gradually become shaky. For example, Poland was originally an ally of France. The French motivation to help it gain independence was originally to control the Soviet Union in the east and resist Germany in the west. Therefore, at the beginning of Poland's founding, it was almost no different from France's protectorate. Moreover, there have always been long-standing grievances between Germany and Poland. Ethnic divisions, the entanglement of the [corridor], and the disputes over the Free City of Danzig and the navigation rights of the Vistula River have all caused rifts in German-Polish relations. Who would have known that in late January of this year, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was actually concluded, agreeing to respect each other's opinions on any issues in the next ten years and never seek solutions through military force. The significance of this is no less than demolishing the carefully built barriers that France has worked so hard to build for more than a decade, and turning to threaten its national security. This is clear to all discerning people. Barthou's trip to Warsaw was naturally to reverse this crisis and repair the old friendship between France and Poland. However, for the sake of its immediate interests and future development, Poland is also forced to cooperate with Germany. France, in view of this, is making every effort to contact Soviet Russia in an attempt to contain Eastern Europe. The idea is that if France and the Soviet Union can be consistent, other small countries will naturally have to follow. The difficulty is that France and the Soviet Union have different dreams and the fundamental contradiction has not been eliminated. Even if an alliance is established, there is a risk of it being broken at any time. However, under common interests, they are only temporarily using each other. Britain saw its hidden feelings, so it held back and calmly observed the changes, interacting with Italy and Germany as tools to coerce France. France could not fathom the depth of Britain, and the propaganda of German-Italian understanding was enough to make it worry. If the forces of the German-Polish alliance invade the territory of Ukraine, the Danube countries will be shaken, and European peace will be threatened. This is France's national disaster.</p>
<p>Barthou's trip to London has clearly explained to the British government the true meaning of France's approaching the Soviet Union and the conclusion of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty, and has actually gained understanding. The news of Anglo-French coordination spread far and wide. However, given the attitude of British public opinion, we still feel that Anglo-French coordination has not reached the point of concluding an alliance treaty. The speculation that [if France goes to war with Germany one day, Britain is willing to continue to help France] is extremely lacking in practical and credible basis. The British people know that today's Germany has no overseas colonies and lacks deeply rooted markets. Its external strength is hollow, and it will never be able to develop excessively. Even if it has modern industrial technology, there is nowhere to apply its strengths. France is not the same. France was the least affected by the world economic panic, and there is still much room for development at home and abroad. Moreover, the amount of cash it has accumulated is the highest in Europe. Since the armistice, relying on the strength of the Versailles system, it has regained a special advantage in politics. If it is supported by the Soviet Union, the old British Empire will be ashamed. Therefore, supporting Germany and suppressing France has been Britain's consistent policy after the war. Although Barthou has given an explanation, and slightly changed his attitude of many years, it is still, as we commented yesterday, a combination of temporary interests, which is not enough to be considered harmonious cooperation. The actions of imperialist countries are purely guided by self-interest and cannot be judged by ordinary morality. Britain and France are both giants among them, so how can they be an exception?</p>
<h3>Imminent San Francisco General Strike: Residents Stockpiling Food, Nearly 20,000 Strikers, Downtown a Desolate Scene</h3>
<p>San Francisco Today: San Francisco residents are stockpiling food in anticipation of a general strike. There is actually no shortage of food, especially canned goods. However, once the general strike begins, prices will skyrocket. Therefore, hotels, restaurants, and even housewives are preparing early to be ready for anything. As for vegetables, etc., there is already a great shortage due to the truck drivers' union strike. Today, the city-wide strike has reached 18,500 people. This morning at 5:00 AM, 2,500 car drivers also joined. After the meat cutters' union strike at 6:00 PM, another thousand will be added. In total, those who have joined the strike now include dockworkers, sailors, truck drivers, bus drivers, streetcar repairmen, and four construction unions. The streets of San Francisco are gradually becoming a desolate scene. After the trucks stopped, gasoline is also in short supply. Private cars cannot be driven. There is not a single taxi or truck to be seen on the main streets. Laundries and butcher shops are closed. Vegetable stores will also be unable to open because they have no goods to sell. Shipbuilding and railway factories have all stopped. If the Central Labor Council recommends a strike, 60 unions have now resolved to participate. Executive Chairman Fantelou will convene a special meeting this afternoon, which will be attended by 117 representatives. Fantelou roughly indicated that the general strike will be held at 10:00 AM on Monday. California's National Guard is still patrolling the coast, but the tension has shifted elsewhere. The deployment of the National Guard has actually reversed the severity of the strike situation, and the situation is expanding, and the effectiveness of the National Guard has been lost. Currently, labor and management still have very different opinions, so a general strike seems inevitable. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>The San Francisco general strike movement has gained the support of the West Coast today. Unions with 75,000 members in various places have agreed to support the general strike. The laundry workers and retail store delivery workers unions voted today to support joining the general strike when needed. It is reported that 80 unions in Portland are preparing to order their members to join the strike. At the same time, three unions in Seattle resolved today to submit the dispute of the dockworkers there to arbitration. Today, a sailor here boarded a shipping company's small boat to work on a certain cargo ship, but was attacked by lurking dockworkers when he left the ship and was seriously injured. The Labor-Management Dispute Mediation Council is now trying its best to make both parties cease fire in order to restore peace. It is currently in consultation. According to a report from wholesalers here, if the labor unrest is not resolved, San Francisco will no longer have a supply of fresh fruits and vegetables tomorrow night. As for the supply of meat, it can only be maintained for five days. It is expected that the supply of gasoline will be greatly lacking from tonight. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>The San Francisco general strike, which will put San Francisco in the same state of great panic as after the great earthquake and fire of 1906, has now been postponed until tomorrow morning to be decided. Today, rioters attacked several large restaurants and theaters, causing female singers to panic and run into the streets. California Governor Mauryman warned strikers today that if they do not find a way to ensure the continuous transportation of food and medicine in San Francisco, he will order the necessary actions to be taken. The strikers have agreed to establish a strike committee of more than 700 people and are now arranging to decide whether to issue a general strike notice tomorrow morning.

<h3>Japan Holds Five-Minister Conference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada convened a five-minister conference at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the 14th. The attendees were Prime Minister Okada, Army Minister Hayashi, Navy Minister Osumi, Finance Minister Fujii, and Foreign Minister Hirota. They discussed the statements on national defense, foreign policy, and financial policies that the government will issue next week. First, Foreign Minister Hirota explained the matters decided by the Saito Cabinet's five-minister conference, namely: (1) Japan aims for world peace, responds to international situations, and implements Japan's policies through diplomatic means; (2) In national defense, it will not be threatened by other countries or foreign insults, and will build a national defense force commensurate with national strength. Then the five ministers, based on this policy, studied how the new cabinet should follow the matters decided by the previous five-minister conference. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the naval disarmament conference is approaching next year, Japan has decided on its fundamental policy on this and plans to incorporate the adjustment of national defense, foreign policy, and finance into the Okada Cabinet's policy and announce it to the world. At 10:20 AM today, a so-called five-minister conference was held at the Secretary's official residence to discuss this issue. Prime Minister Okada spoke first, saying that the previous Saito Cabinet had held a five-minister conference to decide on the fundamental policy of national defense, foreign policy, and finance, but he did not know its contents. Also, Army Minister Hayashi and Finance Minister Fujii did not know the details. He asked Navy Minister Osumi and Foreign Minister Hirota, who attended the five-minister conference at the time, to explain the process. Navy Minister Osumi then explained in detail all the processes, discussion items, and decisions of the Saito Cabinet's five-minister conference for two hours. Foreign Minister Hirota further supplemented the points that Navy Minister Osumi had not mentioned. After a temporary break at 12:30 PM, the meeting continued at 1:40 PM. Navy Minister Osumi then explained the process of the Navy's establishment of the second supplementary plan based on the [Japan's national defense should not be threatened by other countries or foreign insults, and attention should be paid to building a national defense commensurate with national strength] policy decided by the previous five-minister conference. Then Foreign Minister Hirota explained the resolution of [International relations should aim for world peace, and Japan should implement its policies through diplomatic means] and the current international situation. After Prime Minister Okada, Army Minister Hayashi, Finance Minister Fujii, etc. questioned the points of doubt, the whole agreed that the above two fundamental principles were the fundamental policy of the current cabinet. However, the discussion items did not reach a conclusion and the meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. A second meeting will be held on the 21st to continue deliberations on specific issues. Navy Minister Osumi told reporters after the five-minister conference that, in the first half of today's meeting, he explained the naval power of the powers and Japan's position during the Saito Cabinet era, and the necessity of today's national defense policy. In the afternoon, Foreign Minister Hirota explained foreign policy issues. As a result, the fundamental policy of the previous five-minister conference was unanimously recognized. Today's meeting was all about explanations and questions, and there was no discussion of particularly specific issues. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army does not pay much attention to today's new five-minister conference, saying that the Okada Cabinet held a five-minister conference shortly after its establishment to discuss the national policy of following the Saito Cabinet and the need to consult with relevant cabinet members. The Army Minister Hayashi himself also believes that the resolution of the previous cabinet's five-minister conference is sufficient, so he will clarify the focus of the meeting at today's meeting and exchange opinions on whether to continue the meeting in the future.

<h3>Eastern European Pact Negotiations: Britain Submits Three Notes to Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Some British newspapers reported this morning that yesterday, British Ambassador to Germany, Fipps, visited German Foreign Minister Neurath and personally delivered three documents. The first document stated the plan for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, the second stated the French-Russian mutual guarantee system, and the third stated the procedure for making this guarantee system correspond with the Locarno Treaty. This statement was denied by officials, who claimed that Fipps only sent one note to the German government, stating Britain's support for France's proposal to conclude the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and expressing Britain's hope that Germany would also participate in this proposal. It is also generally said that the wording of this note is the same as that of Foreign Minister Simon in the House of Commons yesterday. It is also generally said that although German Foreign Minister Neurath did not give a definite answer when meeting Fipps, he did raise some objections to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact plan to the British ambassador in his personal capacity. However, the general public does not want to draw overly pessimistic conclusions about the results of Britain's negotiations based on the impressions gained from the initial contact.

<h3>Mussolini Changes Attitude: The Process</h3>
<p>Rome: Italy has changed its drastic opposition to the Eastern Locarno Pact and supports Britain's position. This morning, newspapers were still refuting the French proposal, but in the afternoon, they had to change their tone because a semi-official communiqué stated that Italy is now giving preferential consideration to Britain's views. The change in Italy's attitude was caused by the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, explaining to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini the results of French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Britain. At the same time, British Foreign Minister Simon's remarks in the House of Commons today also indicated the agreement between Britain and Italy on Russia, as the Italian government has always advocated that Soviet Russia should join the League of Nations. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italy's unexpected endorsement of the Eastern European Conference Agreement was officially announced last night. The reason given was that the agreement had fundamentally changed. After French Foreign Minister Barthou and British Foreign Minister Simon discussed it in London, the original intention of the agreement had been altered. When the agreement was first drafted, it was originally directed against Germany, but after this revision, the original dangers in it had been removed, and the newly revised clauses had clearly recognized the equal status demanded by Germany, without reservation. Italy has always adopted the same policy as Britain, and has never wanted to interfere in the disputes between Germany and France, but only to maintain universal peace in Europe, and has no intention of assuming additional obligations beyond the Locarno Treaty. Now that the Eastern Locarno Conference Agreement does not increase Italy's burden, it is prepared to accept it. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Italian Stefani News Agency issued a message saying that Italian people are satisfied with the results of the British-French London talks.

<h3>Hitler Reports on Quelling the Rebellion: Emphasizes Domestic Affairs, Not Foreign Policy; Newspapers Praise, but People Still Talk Privately; Doubts Persist About the Number of Killings</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers unanimously praise Hitler's speech, but people are still whispering and expressing doubts, thinking that Hitler's speech may not be able to completely stabilize those who are rebellious. As for whether the Sturmabteilung members who were dismissed due to reorganization can be convinced by this speech is also unknown. Hitler's remarks about Nazi Party members insulting prisoners are quite controversial. People want to know the names of those who were shot for committing this crime, but Reuters has learned from officials that their names will never be announced. The London Evening Standard, Paris Soir, and Paris-Midi have been banned from circulation in Bavaria until July 25 for making inappropriate remarks. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French people attach great importance to the fact that German Chancellor Hitler's speech did not mention foreign policy. It is widely believed that British Foreign Minister Simon's speech in Parliament yesterday, which was extremely endorsed by the French press, has created a new diplomatic situation, so Hitler deleted the important remarks on foreign affairs that he had prepared and did not mention them. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian newspapers today did not comment on German Chancellor Hitler's speech in Parliament. But according to officials, this speech was only related to domestic affairs, and its merits and demerits can only be judged by Germany itself. However, the people of Rome were quite shocked to hear that so many people were shot. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Heavily Guarded</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Tonight, the German assembly met at the Kroll Opera House. Chancellor Hitler attended and spoke about the recent quelling of the rebellion. When he mentioned the phrase [I will destroy the germs of revolution before they germinate], the crowd cheered incessantly. After Hitler's speech, the members unanimously cheered and approved the government's actions to quell the rebellion and passed a resolution thanking the Chancellor. Hitler originally rested in the garden of the Reich Chancellery to prepare for the speech in Parliament. He only returned to Berlin this afternoon. Military and police security was very tight to prevent accidents. Police guarded each entrance of the theater all day long. Hitler was accompanied by armed guards, and dozens of carefully selected black-uniformed guards were scattered throughout the theater. When Hitler arrived at the theater, a large crowd cheered him to show respect. There was not a single empty seat in the theater. The 660 members, dressed in black or brown uniforms, all stood up and raised their arms to cheer, shouting "Long live!" three times. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Outline of Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler's speech in the German Parliament tonight called on world public opinion to uphold justice. While Hitler was speaking, the German Parliament was packed with people, and all the people of Germany were listening in front of public and private radios, either standing or sitting. The world also exchanged and transmitted it through more than ten radio networks, which can be described as far-reaching. Hitler's speech first described the situation in the autumn of crisis when he was ordered to take office on January 30, 1933, how the new government implemented the revolution plan to rise and flourish, and the labor and continuation of renewing with the people in the year and a half of holding power, such as the restoration work of 4.5 million people. Hitler also said that restoring party politics is a fantasy and guaranteed to the German people that the Nazi Party is trying to solve the national crisis. After praising National Socialism, Hitler attacked its three enemies: first, the Communist Party that kills and sets fires; second, the general figures of the old government who lost power; and third, the destroyers who worship revolution. Hitler gave a systematic and detailed official report on the conspiracy and handling of the recent incident. Prussian Prime Minister and Minister of Aviation Goering then took the stage to give a passionate speech praising Chancellor Hitler's iron will and expressing his loyalty and sincerity to Chancellor Hitler. After Goering's speech, the Parliament voted to approve the government's declaration and expressed its gratitude to the Chancellor for saving the motherland from the danger of civil war. The meeting adjourned. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Seventy-Seven People Killed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler's speech in the German Parliament tonight detailed the recent revolutionary conspiracy and how he made the most painful decision of his life to order the execution of Sturmabteilung leaders and their staff officers. Hitler said, [I am prepared to accept the responsibility for these 24 hours in history, because it was the time when I made the most painful decision of my life. In the future, if fate takes me away from my current position, I hope that those who come later will also adopt this tough policy to protect the safety of the country and the people]. Hitler also warned that if there is any more rebellious behavior in the future, it will be dealt with in the same way. Hitler's speech started at 8:04 and ended at 9:40. The Parliament cheered and approved when his speech was over. Hitler said that Sturmabteilung Commander and Cabinet Minister Röhm was the initiator of promoting this conspiracy and embezzled as much as 12 million marks from subsidies to charitable organizations. In this operation, 19 senior Sturmabteilung leaders and 31 junior leaders and members were shot. Three Sturmabteilung special squad leaders and 13 ordinary squad leaders and civilians were killed for resisting arrest. In addition, three Sturmabteilung members committed suicide out of fear of crime. Five Nazi Party members who did not belong to the Sturmabteilung were also killed for joining the conspiracy. In addition, three special squad members were executed by firing squad for abusing prisoners. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>List of Victims Will Never Be Released: Who Knows How Many Died?</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The list of victims of the recent turmoil will never be released. This was announced by a government spokesman, who said that Chancellor Hitler's speech last night has effectively ended the discussion of the shootings on and after June 30. It is widely speculated that the 77 people Hitler claimed to have been shot is far more than that. Reuters investigated with a military officer of the Wehrmacht, who said that a total of 186 people died. Then I asked a police officer who said that about a hundred people died. A foreign diplomat estimated that the number of deaths should be between two and three hundred. According to general opinion, the number of people shot is no less than 200, because many private shootings occurred after the official purge operation ended. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Process of Suppressing the Coup</h3>
<p>Hitler then said that on June 29, he received a message from Munich saying that the Sturmabteilung leaders would announce a state of emergency at 9:00 PM that night. [In this situation, I could only eliminate the rebellion by lightning means, regardless of cruelty and bloodshed. Rather than letting tens of thousands of innocent Sturmabteilung members attack tens of thousands of equally innocent comrade members, it would be better to annihilate hundreds of rebellious people. Therefore, I ordered that they be killed without exception]. The emergency message that Hitler received on June 29 stated that the final preparations for overthrowing the government were about to be completed. The uprising would begin in Berlin at 4:00 PM and the Sturmabteilung would occupy the government capital at 5:00 PM, commanded by Commander Ernst, who has now been shot. As for the initial plan of this conspiracy, it was Röhm who reported to Hitler that the Sturmabteilung was unstable and that this unrest could only be eliminated if Hitler granted him all military power. Hitler refused, and the conspirators prepared to revolt. At that time, a senior Sturmabteilung leader planned to assassinate Hitler, but Röhm opposed it, so it was not carried out. Hitler then discussed Germany's economic situation, saying that if the world market boycotted German trade, there would be many talented inventors in Germany who could make Germany independent and self-sufficient. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Hitler continued to describe the preparations for the rebellion, saying that they deliberately spread propaganda, pointing out that the Wehrmacht had a plan to dismiss the Sturmabteilung. At the same time, Röhm gathered millions of marks in the name of saving society and recruited loyal followers as his private party. At the beginning of June, he (Hitler) made a final attempt to save the rebellion and called Röhm for talks. Röhm strongly stated that the rumors were untrue and that he would try to correct them. As a result, the Sturmabteilung leaders were preparing to change the Prime Minister. Most of the Sturmabteilung leaders secretly reported that they had also heard about the rebellion plan, but they were willing to be detained for a day or two to avoid the impact of the rebellion and affect diplomacy. At the same time, the rebel party had elected a person to take over the position of Deputy Prime Minister. Sturmabteilung Leader Uhl admitted before he was killed that he was the one who was responsible for carrying out the order to expel the Prime Minister. Hitler continued to say that he did not believe that his friendship with Röhm was completely false, and he did not want to expose the content and make a laughingstock of foreigners. Hitler then detailed Röhm's immoral life and his disregard for his advice. Röhm also used a corrupted madman to collude with former Prime Minister Schleicher. Schleicher drafted a declaration announcing that the current political situation could not continue and that the army, navy, and all agencies in the country must be controlled by one person, namely Röhm. Deputy Prime Minister Papen must be replaced and replaced by someone else. As for the Prime Minister, he will temporarily remain in office. He strongly opposed this proposal. Röhm and Ernst had both claimed to others that a long-lasting bloody war would break out in the country. The seriousness of this situation was first revealed by foreign telegrams. British and French newspapers often carried news that the German revolution was imminent. Therefore, he decided to arrest Röhm and others to prevent the tragedy of millions of people bleeding. At 1:00 AM on the night of June 30, he received an emergency report saying that government offices would be attacked and that the Sturmabteilung had gathered in Munich. He knew that he had to use lightning means to eliminate the trouble before it took shape. If he did not use the method of cutting the Gordian knot, there would be no way to stop the spread of the revolution. It would be better to kill hundreds of rebels than to let thousands of innocent citizens bleed and die. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Hitler continued to talk about the draft of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. This meeting took place 24 hours after Mussolini met with the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, and on the same day, the British Ambassador to Germany, Fitzs, submitted the draft of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact to German Foreign Minister Neurath and notified Germany of Britain's approval of this pact. Today, the Italian newspapers have published detailed information about the contact between the British ambassador and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, showing that Italy is quite sympathetic to the British government's proposal to the German government, and that its spirit will add support. The newspapers have also worked hard to advocate that the four major powers of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in Western Europe should take active forms to seek cooperation. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Political Opponents of the National Socialist Party</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Herr Hitler continued by saying that a small group of international conspirators and believers in communism are intentionally inciting turmoil in Germany, which is extremely abhorrent. These foolish and lawless people are still trying to carry out their destructive work. However, the German working class has now thoroughly recognized the treacherous nature of this kind of [Jewish-style international benefactor of humanity]. The National Socialist government will thoroughly eliminate the remnants of this poisonous legacy. Herr Hitler went on to denounce the politicians who lost power after the National Socialist Party seized power on January 30, 1933, saying that they were still unwilling to submit and were trying to show off their abilities. Herr Hitler also denounced the revolutionaries who wanted to make revolution a permanent career, saying that many of them had fought for National Socialism, but they did not know that their lawless attitude was now out of step with the times. He had told Rohm, the leader of the Stormtroopers, but without any obvious effect, and complaints had increased instead. Reports were repeatedly received stating that senior Stormtrooper leaders were advocating a new revolution, but Rohm was still trying to cover it up. Witnesses who reported the conspiracy were often mistreated. Senior leaders continued to work to induce the Stormtroopers to break away from the National Socialist Party. It was obvious that Rohm was very busy presiding over this ambitious plan. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>National Socialist Doctrine Difficult to Reconcile with Industrial Needs - Leaders of Economic Life Dismissed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Dr. Kessler, the leader of German economic life, was dismissed for disobedience. Today, the authorities announced the resignation of Dr. Bischoff, a leader in the chemical industry. Although Bischoff's resignation was attributed to overwork, it is generally seen as a sign that the actual needs of German industry are difficult to reconcile with the economic doctrines of the National Socialist Party. Both Kessler and Bischoff were appointed in March of this year. Kessler was not only the leader of the new economic institutions, but also the chairman of AEG and an industrial advisor to Hitler.

<h3>Hitler Silent on Diplomacy - French Newspapers Express Disappointment</h3>
<p>(Paris) In yesterday's speech to the Reichstag, German Chancellor Hitler limited the content to domestic issues and remained silent on international issues. French newspapers commented on Hitler's attitude, saying that it showed that Germany was in a difficult situation after the recent Anglo-French consultations in London and Italy's change of attitude in favor of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. For example, Le Matin said, "[People were generally hoping that Hitler would make an important speech, but now he does not say a word about foreign policy, which is disappointing. Hitler must have temporarily deleted the part of his speech on foreign policy because of the recent British government's dealings with Berlin and Mussolini's expression of his attitude and support for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact." Le Journal reached the same conclusion, saying, "Before Hitler's speech was delivered, people generally thought that there would be grand and candid remarks, and that there would be some indication of Germany's diplomatic policy. Now, by remaining silent on foreign policy, we should also pay attention to this, because Hitler did not initially want to discuss it, but later changed his mind and thought that it would be better to remain silent, which is obviously easy to see." The Berlin correspondent of L'Écho de Paris said after analyzing Hitler's speech, "Hitler's speech is over. My impression is that it is very disappointing, because what people expected from Hitler was not just these few words. Hitler probably thought that it was best to delay the matter at present, so he delayed and did not want to say more." (Havas dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<h3>New York Times Says Hitler Retreats</h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an editorial commenting on Hitler's declaration to the Reichstag, entitled "Hitler Has Taken a Defensive Stance." The content briefly stated that Hitler seemed to feel uneasy and needed to defend himself to the people. Foreigners who were eager to hear the German Chancellor's speech were probably the most numerous this time. However, most of Hitler's words were old clichés, which had been uttered by Hitler countless times. Hitler only offered one reason for the punitive measures he had taken this time, namely that some people were plotting to overthrow the current government and attempting to build another revolutionary government. The only thing that had not been seen in previous speeches was that Hitler was doing his best to explain to the people so that the people would still trust him, and expressed that this was his only hope. However, from our point of view, today's Hitler is no longer comparable to the Hitler of the past, because Hitler's speech today was almost a low-pitched plea for the support of the people, and not like before, he used commanding words to force people to obey. However, Aviation Minister Goering's declaration yesterday stated that Hitler's will is the law and still maintained his usual stubborn attitude. What we foreigners find gratifying is that the German government no longer wants to formulate violent laws in Hitler's name. (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>New York Min Pao Says Speech of a Superstitious Man</h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao published an article commenting on Hitler's speech in the Reichstag yesterday, entitled "Speech of a Superstitious Man." The article said, "Hitler overstepped the authority of the court and executed his assistants with simple procedures. This time, he listed various motivations to clarify his justification. He confidently believed that this explanation would not only satisfy those who listened to his speech, but also satisfy the rest of the world. This is something that anyone who reads Hitler's speech can see and there is no doubt about it. However, millions of people in Europe and the United States have always believed that Hitler is enough to threaten civilization and European peace, and now they are even more convinced that Hitler's speech is even more chilling, because it is all from the heart. We speculate that after Hitler returned from a short break in the mountains, he was confident that he could accomplish great things, so he publicly declared that the Brownshirts would soon restore their original position in the streets of Germany, and pointed out that National Socialism had overcome difficulties and its momentum would be greater than before. In short, all of this is boastful and somewhat insane. Why is this? Because Hitler is confident that his authority and that of Germany will not be damaged by recent events."

<h3>Foreign Newspapers Resist</h3>

<h3>Johnson Criticizes Hitler - United States Apologizes to Germany</h3>
<p>(Washington) General Johnson, the director of the American Recovery Administration, attacked German Chancellor Hitler's indiscriminate killing of political opponents in a speech in Waterloo, which almost became an international problem between the United States and Germany. However, the State Department quickly took steps to avoid it. After the German chargé d'affaires in the United States, Leitner, formally protested, the State Department immediately expressed its apology, but said that General Johnson was expressing his personal opinion and not speaking on behalf of the US government. Observers believe that this matter has come to an end, which can be called one of the fastest resolved matters in diplomatic history. General Johnson heard of the German protest in Omaha and replied, "I am responsible for what I said and will never withdraw it. The State Department may not order me to withdraw it either." He only stated that his remarks were his personal opinion and did not represent the government. He believed that the brutality of the National Socialist Party showed how far a country's constitution could fall after being overthrown. (National dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>General Johnson, director of the National Recovery Administration in Omaha, went to the Pacific coast.

<h3>Soviet Russia Mechanized - National Wartime Preparation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian factories are actively carrying out mechanization under wartime conditions, in order to free up manpower for emergencies.

<h3>Eliminating the Jiangxi Bandits - Absolutely Confident - Talk by Wan Guo'an After Inspecting the Front Lines</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Wan Guo'an, a nationalist literary writer, came to Jiangxi to join the army in the early spring of this year to participate in the suppression of bandits. He arrived in the province from the front lines on official business on the morning of the 14th. According to him, the Jiangxi bandits can be wiped out in the near future, and our army has absolute confidence. The bandit troops are familiar with the terrain and move quickly, often breaking up into small groups and then gathering them together, which makes us exhausted. However, since our army changed its strategy and implemented a steady and gradual advance, building bunkers everywhere, the bandits have been unable to do anything. If they break up into small groups, we can calmly defeat them one by one. If they gather the small groups together, then the main force is concentrated, which gives us a clear target and makes it easy to encircle them from all sides and wipe them out in one fell swoop. Moreover, the bandit side has a small number of strong men and a lack of guns and ammunition. All necessary supplies cannot be replenished due to our economic blockade. Therefore, in military terms, the bandits have become fish in a cauldron, and their elimination is only a matter of time. Every time our army recovers a place, in addition to constructing bunkers and other military fortifications, we build houses, cultivate fields, build roads, and plant trees for the people, so that the local area can recover and the people can live and work in peace. Therefore, the troops on the front lines are deeply trusted and loved by the people. The bewitching, deception, and intimidation that the bandits usually used on the people has now completely failed. The people in the bandit areas are in deep water and fire, and they deeply hope that the National Army will advance to relieve them, just like expecting clouds in a severe drought.

<h3>Song Ziwen Gives a Talk in Qingdao</h3>

Because Shanghai is very hot, he will stay in Qingdao for more than a month before returning. To relieve the northwest rural areas, the first priority is water conservancy. The relief methods in Qin Dynasty are divided into two categories: (1) For those with existing water conservancy, the bank will invest and strive to improve it, and will also urge and guide them. For those with completely dry land who invest in water conservancy, a method has been agreed with the province, and the bank will build it without capital, and the government will provide guarantees. The province's high-interest loans are easier to invest. The water conservancy in Ningxia, Guanzhong, and Hanzhong is good. The ancient canal projects are complete and can be used with slight repairs. Gansu's Yellow River water conservancy is easy to handle. An initial allocation of 500,000 yuan has been agreed with Chairman Zhu, which can irrigate 600,000 mu of land. Each mu will be repaid 5 jiao per year, and it can be recovered in two years and repaired in rotation. 2 million mu of fertile land can be obtained in four or five years. The small amount of money can be used to multiply the effect, which is enough to prevent drought and prepare for famine. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<h3>Disposal Measures for Defaced National Currency</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Xingying recently ordered the headquarters of the three provinces to issue a seal of Soviet characters on the national currency by the Red bandits. It attempted to seal off the cash in the bandit areas, but since it collapsed and scattered among the people, it was inconvenient to allow them to use it, but it could not be weighed with counterfeit currency. Therefore, three measures are specified: (1) The hard currency shall be recovered by the local county government at a full price and transferred to the financial department of each province for appropriation and reimbursement, and the financial department shall prepare a document and transfer the original currency to the central currency factory for re-casting. (2) The paper currency shall be collected by the local county government at full price and transferred to the original issuing bank for cash redemption according to the face value. (3) The local military and political leaders should always strictly investigate the reasons for the defacement of the national currency and its source to prevent abuses. If there is any suspicion of collusion with the Red bandits, they should still be punished according to law. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>

It fell 0625 at 11:00 am and rebounded 125 at noon, but the amount of the increase fell again at the close, so the final price was 5 yuan 038115, down 0625 from the opening.</p>
<p>The opening price between the UK and France was 7 francs 40, the same as yesterday's price, and remained unchanged until the close.</p>

<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>New York Cotton The cotton market opened stable and active. The weather in Texas is still dry. Speculators bought in, but there were also profit-taking and sales from the South, which were absorbed. Some reports of fruit worm damage have been received, so the opening price rose by 5 pounds. It continued to rise after that. At 10:40 am, the price of cotton was up 45 pounds from the opening price.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton The Bombay cotton market rose due to purchases by speculators and futures traders, but was slightly affected later due to sales by European exporters. The price of Bellocchi cotton for July and August was 216 rupees 25 this evening, up 2 rupees.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton Liverpool cotton prices continued to rise today. At the close, the October contract was up 9 pounds at 6.84.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat The Liverpool wheat market was firm this morning due to the stable Chicago wheat market yesterday. The closing price for the October contract was 5 shillings 2 pence 625, up one and a half pence.</p>
<h3>Rubber</h3>
<p>The London rubber market opened stable this morning. The trading price for October and December was 7 pence 25, up 0625 from yesterday.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The New York Stock Market opened sluggishly this morning with narrow trading. Stock prices mostly rose slightly, and market sentiment was stable. According to observers, although speculators are now leaning towards commodities again, causing a slight impact on the stock market, the strong footing after yesterday's slight rise indicates that stock prices will continue to gradually rise. The New York stock prices (as of 10:30 AM) are listed below:</p>

<p>An Dong Special Dispatch: In order to prevent ships supplying weapons to the triangular zone from our mainland from docking, the Japanese army has ordered the coastal police force to immediately arrest any suspicious ships and conduct strict searches. At the same time, it has urged the An Dong County Public Office to convene village chiefs from various coastal counties to discuss prevention measures, and three items have been decided, which will be implemented immediately: (1) Along the coast, a watchtower will be set up every three li, and self-defense team outposts will be set up inside to monitor nearby ships. (2) All dense reeds within 200 meters of the coast will be cut down. (3) The self-defense team on watch must immediately report directly to the coastal police force if they encounter any suspicious ships (Northeast News Agency).</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department to Relieve Drought in Jiangnan, Proposes Plan to Draw Water from Rivers and Lakes, Project Cost Estimated at 450,000 Yuan, Uses Pumps to Draw Water into the Grand Canal</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that the waterways in Jiangnan counties are mainly based on the Grand Canal, and their water sources are either from the Yangtze River tide, which is irrigated from the river mouths, or from mountain water supported by lakes and ponds. In order to relieve the drought, it is proposed to draw water from both the river and the lake, and irrigate each water area connecting the river and the lake, and inject it into the Grand Canal, so that water can be used for bailing everywhere, benefiting everyone. The location, method, and cost of all pumping stations are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>Pumping Locations: (1) Dantu Port in Zhenjiang, entering the canal from Dantu Port; (2) Jiuqu River Mouth in Danyang, entering the Danyang Canal from Jiuqu River Mouth; (3) Menghe in Wujin, entering the canal from Shiqiao Town to Benniu at the confluence of the large and small Menghe; (4) Desheng Port Mouth in Wujin, bailing water in Weicun Town, and entering the canal along Desheng Port; (5) Zao Port Mouth in Wujin, bailing water in Xutang Town, and dividing it into the canal through Fenghuang River and Yan Tang River; (6) The above six locations are for drawing river water; (7) Houxu Gehu Mouth in Wujin, bailing water into the canal; (8) Liaohe Gehu Mouth in Wujin, bailing water into Wujin Canal and Yichang Caohe; (9) Diaqiao Gehu Mouth in Wujin, bailing water into Wujin Canal; (10) Yixing Gaodu Port, injecting water from Gehu into Yichang Caohe and Yixing City; (11) Wuxi Quxi Mouth, entering Wuxi Canal from Taihu Lake; (12) Wuxian Wangting Shadun Port Mouth, entering the canal from Taihu Lake; (13) Wuxian Xukou, entering the Xujiang River to Suzhou City from Taihu Lake; (14) Wujiang Guajing Mouth, entering the canal from Taihu Lake; (15) Wujiang Beichi Dapu Mouth, from Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Entering the canal; (16) Wuxian Weiting Yangcheng Lake Mouth entering Zhihe Pond, the above eleven locations are for drawing lake water.</p>
<p>Implementation Methods: (1) Regarding the determination of construction sites, allocation, installation of pumps, the Department of Construction will send personnel to guide the construction, and the local county government will be responsible for the management, and the Department of Construction will supervise it at any time. If the pumps cannot be prepared in time, fire engines and old-fashioned manual water wheels can be used as supplements. All county rice mills should also be borrowed to provide power for the pumps; (2) Regarding the distribution of bailing water into tributary rivers and fields, farmers should bail and save themselves, and the county government should be responsible for overall planning and distribution to avoid disputes, and send technicians to guide them at any time.</p>
<p>Budget Estimate and Resolution Method: Passed a special drought relief fund of 450,000 yuan as the project cost for drawing water from rivers and lakes. The Construction Department and the Finance Department will quickly handle it together.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in Shaanxi Province, Yellow River Continues to Rise, Water Level Reaches Over 29 Meters</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong has risen sharply due to heavy rain in the upstream Shaanxi Province. The huge waves and torrents poured fiercely into Shandong. The water level at Luokou has reached 28 meters and 3 inches. Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, was afraid that an accident would occur due to the sudden rise in water level, so he immediately notified the flood control personnel along the river to strictly guard against it to avoid negligence. The River Affairs Bureau received another report from Luokou in the middle reaches at 6:00 AM today (12th) that the water level suddenly rose sharply again, still due to the continuous rise in water in the upstream Shaanxi Province. Therefore, the water level in Shandong's various reaches has also increased sharply. Except for those that had fallen during the previous easing, it has risen sharply by 1 meter, 3 inches, and 6 minutes, which is equivalent to more than 4 feet in Chinese measurement, and the water level has reached 29 meters and 5 minutes. It is still more than 2 meters lower than the highest water level last year. By 12:00 noon, another report was received that the water level continued to rise by 8 minutes, and the total water level was 29 meters, 1 inch, and 3 minutes. It only eased and dropped 1 inch and 8 minutes at 6:00 PM. After receiving the report, Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, set off from Jinan at 6:00 AM today (12th) to inspect the rising water situation at Luokou in the middle reaches and to check the flood control works. He also sent separate telegrams to the flood control sections, etc., to strictly guard and patrol all night to avoid negligence, and reported the rising water situation to the provincial government. After inspecting the river defense and material factory at Luokou, Zhang returned to Jinan immediately.</p>

<h3>National Army Presses Towards Ningdu, Bandit Areas Can Be Fully Recovered Once Highway Is Completed</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the National Army recaptured Guangchang, it immediately launched two columns to attack the bandit areas and capture Shicheng. According to Guangchang, the Northern Route Headquarters was moved from Fuzhou to Nancheng, and the General Headquarters, which was originally in Nancheng, also moved to Guangchang. General Commander Chen Cheng is currently serving as the deputy commander of the military training regiment in Lushan, and all military affairs are temporarily handled by Deputy General Commander Luo Zhuoying. Luo arrived in Guangchang on the 2nd of this month to command, and the morale of the front was greatly boosted. On the 3rd, they recaptured Toupi, Hucenba, and Dongshanba, the key passes to Ningdu, and the Yongfeng garrison also recovered Toupi, east of Longgang, and advanced to the Yuexi area, where the three counties of Yongning and Xing meet. The two highways from Guangchang to Ningdu and from Yongfeng Longgang to Guganglonggang in Xingguo are now under the protection of the army, advancing step by step towards the bandit areas. At the same time, the highway from Taihe on the west bank of the Gan River to Tingning in Fujian Province is also under construction. Once the highway is completed, the bandit areas can be fully recovered. The Department of Civil Affairs expects that the six counties of Ning, Shi, Rui, Ling, Hui, and Xing will be fully recovered within this year, but the post-war talent needed in the bandit areas is not easy to find. It has been submitted to the provincial government that all civil servants from the above six counties must follow the army to help with the post-war work in the counties. The post-war personnel from the nine counties sent by the governments of Jiangxi and Fujian provinces will also follow the army to work after completing their training. Therefore, the recovery of each district this time is by no means comparable to the previous situation where the bandits retreated when the soldiers arrived and returned when the soldiers left (10th).</p>
<h3>Eastern Fujian Military Suppression Launched Against Bandits, Provincial Government Appoints Wang Jingjiu as Commander, Mei Pan Troops Begin Fierce Fighting with Bandits</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Because of the rampant banditry along the coast of eastern Fujian, the Fujian Provincial Government ordered Wang Jingjiu, the commander of the 87th Division and the garrison commander of Fuzhou, to lead his troops to carry out a large-scale search and suppression within one month. After receiving the order, Wang led the personnel of the division headquarters to Ningde on July 6. The provincial government received Wang's telegram on the 8th, reporting that he had arrived safely in Ningde County. He plans to set up a bandit suppression headquarters in the county. After the arrangements are completed, he will convene the county magistrates of the eastern Fujian counties and the officers of the troops to hold a bandit suppression meeting to clarify the activities of the local bandits and the recent bandit suppression situation in order to decide on the suppression strategy. On the 10th, the provincial government received another telegram from Wang, stating that it has now been ascertained that the largest bandits in eastern Fujian are Ma Liefeng, Ren Tiefeng, Gao Chengxue, Chen Youbao, and Zeng Guanyu's wife, etc. Each gang has hundreds of people, calling themselves peasant armies or Red Guards. They have established pseudo-district Soviet governments in Zheyang, Zhexi Fuxi, Bailu, Chendun, Xiedun, Jinshan, Nancuo, and other places where the counties of Xiapu Fuan, Fuding, and Ningde meet. The pseudo-government is divided into departments such as finance, military affairs, transportation, culture, grain transportation, land equalization, and Dingfan. They also build blockhouses and mountain villages in strategic locations to defend themselves. On the one hand, they force the people to drive them, and on the other hand, they rob rice and salt to accumulate food. Recently, a group of red bandits, about 1,500 to 1,600 people, with more than 700 guns, has also been discovered in Meiyang Panxi, where the two counties of Ningde and Fuan meet. They looted everywhere, and the situation was especially rampant. Liu Anqi's brigade has been sent to Ningde to suppress them, and fierce fighting has begun. The other routes will be launched after the arrangements are clear (11th).</p>
<h3>Northwestern Inspection Notes - Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>Zhongwei Divides New County</p>
<p>On the 24th, we departed from Zaoyuan Fort and traveled ten li, passing by Guandi Temple. There is a primary school there. Mr. Xu approached and talked to the students, asking, "After studying, what career will you pursue?" They replied, "We will become district chiefs or village chiefs to serve the local area." At that time, the teacher returned from outside, looking flustered. He tugged at Mr. Xu's sleeve and repeatedly called, "Sir, please come to my house for a meal." Mr. Xu politely declined and inquired about the school's operation. He learned that the school has more than forty mu of school land, which can collect more than 320 yuan per year. There are two teachers, each of whom can earn a salary of more than 160 yuan per year. In addition to providing their own books and stationery, students must also pay tuition fees of three to five yuan. The textbooks they read are all the Three Character Classic, Hundred Family Surnames, Poems, and Books. After traveling fifteen li on a sandy road, we arrived at Xiayingzi. The soil is fertile and the water is good, better than Zaoyuan Fort. The vegetable gardens and date orchards are quite lush. Outside the village, green grass is everywhere, and women carry baskets and buckets to dig bitter vegetables or pick bean leaves for a living. The situation is very bleak. Several empty cars came towards us. When asked, they said that they were transporting goods from Ningxia Province to the south. When they arrived at the dam, they were forced to unload the goods by a certain unit, and their livestock were taken to transport wounded soldiers to Zhongwei without paying foot fees, so they returned empty.</p>

<p>(See "Small Dam and Large Dam" on July 9)</p>
<p>After traveling forty li, we arrived at Shikong Fort. We rested for a while and met a催欵员 (debt collector) from the Ningxia Reclamation Bureau. We talked about the land survey. He said, "We will start with the five counties of Ningsuo, Jinji, Lingwu, Zhongwei, and Zhongning first, which is the first phase, and it must be completed by the end of August. The remaining counties are the second phase, which must be completed by the end of the year. The fees for registration, registration, and certificates are eight cents per mu. When the whole province is collected, it will be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan." There are many wolfberry gardens in Shikong Fort. Each mu can collect for eight years, and each plant can collect one sheng, which is very profitable. After traveling another twenty li, we arrived at Shengjing Pass. On the left, it leans against steep mountains, and on the right, it is next to river canals. In the past, it was a military stronghold, but now the pass is dilapidated and unbearable. Because of the hot weather, Mr. Du, Mr. Xu, and Mr. Luo took a bath in the river. Because the water there is very alkaline, it is excellent for removing dirt and cleansing the body. We arrived at Zhongwei County in the evening at 7:00 PM and stayed at Yuhua Hospital.</p>

<p>(See "The Importance of Qing Tongxia" on July 10)</p>
<p>We stayed in Zhongwei County for three days, the 25th, 26th, and 27th. This is because the short-axle car used from Ningxia to Zhongwei needs to be replaced with a long axle to be suitable for going to Lanzhou. Moreover, there is a great lack of drinking water at each station from here on. On the 26th and 27th, Qinghai wounded soldiers set off, so we waited two more days to avoid each other. Both felt thirsty. On the afternoon of the 25th, we went to visit Gao Temple (i.e., Jade Emperor Pavilion). The contents are divided into pavilions for the Supreme God, the Five Mountains, the Three Purities and the Four Heavens, Wenchang Guandi, Guanyin, etc., with five or six floors. Each floor has seven bays, five bays, and three bays, for a total of no less than dozens of halls and pavilions. The structure is exquisite, the decoration is magnificent, the paintings are dark red, and the gold is brilliant. The atmosphere is consistent, and it is also rich in winding and tortuous details. Climbing high and looking into the distance, I am leisurely and fascinated. The headquarters of the 3rd Brigade of the 15th Route is stationed in the temple. I met the adjutant of the brigade. According to him, in order to maintain local customs, the division implemented a ban on prostitution and gambling. It once worked with the Public Security Bureau to investigate the household registration. There were three or four hundred well-known prostitutes in the city, all of whom were engaged in this flesh-and-blood career because of livelihood. However, there were also those who used this to win over powerful people in the military and political circles in order to say something and seek benefits in case of trouble. Later, after the adjutant informed the brigade commander, he agreed to meet us. We had a very pleasant conversation. The brigade commander, Ma Yingcai, is tall and has excellent spirits. He said, "I plan to establish a reading research association in the headquarters in the near future, so that soldiers and officers can study and learn from each other outside of academic and subject operations, so that their knowledge will not lag behind. For local public welfare undertakings, we will divide them into (1) repairing streets, (2) repairing city walls, (3) setting up public libraries, (4) running public schools, (5) building public sports fields. All work will be shared by officers and soldiers of the headquarters." Except for the public schools, which are still under preparation, all the matters described by Brigade Commander Ma are facts, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>The epidemic is prevalent in the suburbs, and many people have died, because it is the hot summer weather and no attention is paid to public health. There is a great lack of medicines for infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever, and it is difficult to treat those who suffer from them, and there is often a danger to life. The same is true for dysentery and diphtheria. According to Dr. Hu of Yuhua Hospital, "The above-mentioned diseases are prevalent once a year. Because they are internal medicine, patients do not often consult Western doctors, and Chinese medicine is also expensive and unaffordable. Many people die without medicine."</p>
<p>[&lt;i&gt;Tianxian Town in Qing Tongxia&lt;/i&gt;]</p>
<p>(See "The Importance of Qing Tongxia" on July 10)</p>
<p>Zhongwei and Zhongning originally belonged to one county. Last year, the Provincial Government Department of Civil Affairs believed that the county had a vast area and a large rural area, and the county government could not reach local administration. Therefore, it suggested that the Provincial Committee divide the two counties. It was approved by the Provincial Affairs Meeting. Zhongwei will remain as it is, and the county seat of Zhongning County will be located in Ningan Fort. The current situation of the division of the two counties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhongwei County covers an area of 4,200 square li, 280 li from east to west and 150 li from north to south. It reaches Alashan in the north, Jinji in the southeast, Shengjing Pass and Shanhe Bridge, Jingyuan in the southwest, and Hongshui in the northwest. The arable land is about 1,200 square li, the sandy land accounts for about 1,800 square li, and the wasteland that can be reclaimed is still being measured. Agricultural products include rice, wheat, and poppies. The coal-producing areas include Daliang Mountain and the upper and lower reaches of the river. The annual output is about 4,550 tons (private mining is not included). Each ton is worth about 5.5 yuan. Unfortunately, it is mined manually, and the output is limited.</p>
<p>Zhongning County was established on January 1, 1934. The county covers an area of 1,500 square li, 150 li from east to west and 100 li from north to south. The arable land is about 950 square li, the sandy land is about 400 li, and the rest is the wasteland along the river. The county borders Jinji County in the east, Shengjing Pass in the west, Haiyuan in the south, Daba in the north, and Alashan in the northwest. In addition to miscellaneous grains and poppies, the county is most abundant in wolfberries. The annual output is about 1,500 dan (240 jin per dan). Each dou is worth 30 to 80 yuan. The best is called Zao Huang, 80 yuan per dou. The next is called Kui Yuan, 60 yuan per dou. The next is called Hui Huo (i.e., ordinary), 30 yuan per dou. Shikong Fort in the county produces about 2,000 tons of coal per year, and each ton is worth 5 to 6 yuan. The county produces more than 100 dan of black moss and more than 100 dan of licorice per year. The value of agricultural by-products throughout the year is no less than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhongwei and Zhongning counties are known as rich areas in Ningxia, but the burden on farmers is too heavy, and the rural economy is still in a slump. According to farmers in Zhongwei and a section chief of the county government, the county government often employs more than a dozen催徵委員(tax collection commission members) and 60 county servants to be responsible for催款(tax collection) affairs in various townships. Each time the commission members and county servants go to the countryside to催款(collect taxes), the farmers must provide travel expenses and food. If they are not treated well, they will be insulted. At present, the burden on farmers is more than 9 yuan per person (average) per year. The journey from Zhongwei to Yingpanzi takes three days and is mostly sandy ridges. It is more difficult to travel than the Sichuan Road because the hooves sink and the wheels get stuck. Because the county government received a phone call from the Department of Civil Affairs, it hired a strong mule and sent two escorts. The kindness is very appreciated.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Urges All Sectors in Nancheng to Practice the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Nancheng Correspondence: Since the Northern Route Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong was stationed here, he has faithfully practiced the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In addition to organizing discipline squads to guide and supervise, organizing New Life Movement clubs to promote and repeatedly convening expanded memorial weeks to repeatedly publicize, he also convened meetings with leaders from all walks of life to discuss how to practice hygiene and cleanliness in order to transform the bad environment of Nancheng. It was resolved to invite hygiene experts to write tens of thousands of wall posters and slogans, distribute them inside and outside the city and in various townships for posting, and print multiple kinds of pamphlets and leaflets on hygiene for distribution. On the other hand, we requested the Jiangxi Department of Education to send 30 students from the Provincial Public Teacher Training Institute to Nancheng on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of June to carry out propaganda work. After the staff arrived, they were divided into ten groups and guided by the heads of the保甲(baojia) to promote the meaning of hygiene and cleanliness in the bustling streets inside and outside the city. We also invited twelve celebrities from the medical community to give lectures on the essentials of hygiene in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the Twelfth Middle School in phases on the 10th and 11th of June. Party, government, military, and school leaders and保甲(baojia) leaders all participated, and the audience each day was about two to three thousand people, who were all moved. From the 12th to the 14th, a hygiene exhibition was held in the Tianyi Mountain Gospel Church, displaying various pictures about hygiene and physiology, so that the public could easily understand and improve. In the evening, hygiene films from the Lanterns and Inspirational Society were shown in the hall and the Twelfth Middle School to arouse public interest, with more than 10,000 people attending in an orderly manner. On the opening day, Gu personally attended the meeting to guide everything. From the 19th to the 21st, a city-wide cleaning was carried out. In addition to the automatic cleaning of each household and shop, all the streets and public places in the city were divided into three major sections, each of which was headed by the Tenth Administrative District Command, the Twentieth Route General Command, and the Commissioner's Office, with several officials leading 20 soldiers, 9 cleaners, and 9 garbage trucks, together with the 保甲(baojia) leaders, to take responsibility. Now the garbage piled up like mountains on the streets of the city has been cleaned up, and it has been completely renewed. From the 22nd to the 24th, door-to-door inspections of hygiene and cleanliness were conducted, and the best first, second, and third places were selected for awards to encourage them. The award ceremony was held on the small school grounds on the 29th, with 10,000 people attending. In order to prevent epidemics, Commander-in-Chief Gu ordered the military medical department of the headquarters to supervise the implementation of epidemic prevention injections and vaccinations by various public hospitals, and plans to extend the deadline to July 15 to achieve universal coverage, which is of great benefit to the people of Nancheng.</p>
<h3>Mountain Kun: Disaster Prevention and Relief in the Midst of Severe Drought</h3>
<p>Since February, Kun County has not seen a drop of rain. The river channels within the city walls are completely dry, making it quite difficult for residents to obtain drinking water. In the rural areas, the rice seedlings in the higher fields have withered and died completely, and those in the lower areas are also on the verge of collapse. Farmers are using oxen to draw water day and night, and there have been frequent reports of oxen collapsing from exhaustion. In response to public opinion, the county government has banned slaughtering for a week, and the populace has hung up banners everywhere praying for rain. However, the past two days have been exceptionally hot, and the heavens show no sign of rain. The price of rice has risen to twelve yuan and fifty cents per stone today, and there is still a tendency for it to continue to rise. Seeing that the drought is turning into a disaster, the landlords within the city held a meeting at the United Fire Relief Association yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to discuss drought relief. As a result, they submitted a request to the county government and telegraphed the provincial authorities to allocate and lend 80,000 yuan in silver from the county's remaining funds, and to borrow 40,000 yuan in silver from the Farmers Bank as an immediate emergency measure. The drought prevention measures are as follows: (1) Purchase water pumps; (2) Organize irrigation cooperatives; (3) Add draft cattle; (4) Open up Yuqianbanglou (a water source); (5) Subsidize farmers' water-drawing costs. The above measures require the full cooperation of the township heads and various tenants under the supervision of the Mountain District Office, and twenty-three people including Xu Menglin, the district officer, have been appointed to actively handle the matter.</p>
<p>[P Songjiang: Convicted Appellant Dies Tragically After Jumping From Train</p>
<p>The County Court sentenced Wang Bao Xiang, a bandit from Xiaokunshan, to sixteen years of imprisonment, and Gu Ada to eighteen years. Peng Xiaodi, Chen Xuesan, and Chen Ziping, perpetrators of the Fengjing Wutong Temple robbery case, were sentenced to three years and six months each. Each of them refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal. Furthermore, Qian Sanbao, a counterfeiter, was sentenced to three months, and Qian Ahu and Sun A'er were each sentenced to two months. The prosecutor filed an appeal. The Jiangsu High Court scheduled a hearing. The prosecutor's office dispatched bailiffs Zhou Shaotang and Tao Jinhe to escort the above-mentioned criminals to Suzhou on the 14th at 10 AM. However, when the train passed Xinzhuang Station, about four miles east of Dongshan, Qian Ahu, the counterfeiter sentenced to two months, feigned needing to urinate, and taking advantage of the guards' inattention, jumped from the train to escape, tragically dying under the wheels. The bailiffs immediately reported to the prosecutor's office via long-distance telephone, and an official was dispatched to investigate.</p>
<h3>Fire Brigade Trial Run Causes Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>The members of the First District Fire Brigade in this city, considering the dry weather and to ensure preparedness for fire emergencies, announced that they would gather at Songhui Motor Road every day at 6:00 PM to practice with the pump trucks. Coincidentally, on the evening of the 12th, a slight disturbance arose at Songhui Amusement Park due to a ticket dispute. Three people, including Lu A'yun, were arrested on the spot for questioning. After investigation, it was determined that they were not related to the fire brigade members. Subsequently, in the "Daily Morning News" correspondence from this county, it was reported that fire brigade members and more than three hundred hooligans had disturbed the amusement park. The county magistrate, believing there was a background to it, is now thoroughly investigating. Upon reading the newspaper, all members of the First District believed the report was inaccurate and elected eight representatives to visit the county magistrate, presenting the "Daily Morning News." Magistrate Jin denied ever making such a statement on the spot, and said that the news item should be corrected immediately. The fire brigade members then expressed their satisfaction. They then visited the chief of the Public Security Bureau, who also agreed to issue a statement to clarify the matter. It is unknown whether the commotion can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Relief Measures Amidst Severe Drought</h3>
<p>The extreme drought and heat in Suzhou have been repeatedly reported in the "Suzhou News." Yesterday, the 14th, the scorching sun still blazed high, and the weather was hot and dry. In the rural fields, only thirty to forty percent of the land has been planted with seedlings. However, according to custom, even if rain comes after the third day of the sixth lunar month, it will be hopeless. Therefore, yesterday was nothing less than a death sentence for ordinary farmers. In addition to undertaking well-digging and other legitimate measures to alleviate the drinking water shortage, various local organizations in the urban area have been busy setting up altars and performing rituals to pray for rain. Furthermore, Director Wu of the Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant outside Xumen reported that all the water pumps in the plant have been sold out. He is now under provincial order to purchase two hundred more pumps without delay. Therefore, yesterday (the 14th), he went to Shanghai to purchase more, and has prepared 350,000 yuan in cash for the large-scale purchase of water pumps. Another 100,000 yuan will be used to purchase machinery parts and it is planned to convert various small wheel motors into water pumps, drawing water from Taihu Lake into the city. (Of the fifty-plus ferries traveling to various places, forty have ceased operation as of yesterday, the 14th.) This is to urgently alleviate Suzhou's water shortage. It is said that the Construction Department also dispatched personnel to Wuxi yesterday (the 14th) to survey the water situation in Taihu Lake, so that dams can be built in Taihu Lake, and then water can be pumped into various lakes and harbors. Because Taihu Lake is drying up, whether the above plan can be effective will be determined after a timely survey. At the same time, the Wu County Construction Bureau has decided to start opening artesian wells in the city at Pingjiang Road, Xinxueqian, Henggang, and Qimen. The county government has instructed the Chamber of Commerce to ban the hoarding of rice in order to stabilize market prices. As for the rice straw needed for residents' daily fuel, the source has already been cut off. Only 150 catties are sold per yuan. If there is no rain in another two days, it will be difficult for manure boats to enter the city, and residents' waste disposal may also become a problem.</p>
<h3>Haimen: River Dredging Leads to Armed Conflict</h3>
<p>The Xitou canal in the Third District, about ten miles long from north to south, is an important waterway in the district. Due to the prolonged drought and lack of rain, the canal has dried up. Residents, facing a drinking water shortage, elected representatives such as Yang Yunhe to petition the county government to allow them to open the canal themselves to connect to the Yangtze River in order to draw in the tide. Yesterday (the 12th), more than a thousand villagers took action. Unexpectedly, villagers in the northern section of the canal suddenly expressed opposition, gathering more than a thousand people to stop them. The two sides clashed, using farm implements as weapons and engaging in a mixed battle. As a result, dozens of people on both sides were injured. Today (the 13th), each side submitted a complaint to the county government, and the villagers who were injured carried the Yang villager to the county to request an investigation.</p>
<h3>Derelict Iron Barge Found in Songji Port</h3>
<p>A derelict iron barge was washed ashore by a huge tide in the Songji Port beach in the First District the day before yesterday. The barge is of considerable size, with nothing inside. The local residents reported it to Xu Guozhang, the captain of the First Detachment of the Harbor Water Police, who sent police to guard the vessel and await the owner to claim it.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Crop Wilting, Disaster Imminent</h3>
<p>Due to the drought and lack of rain, crops are wilting and disaster is imminent. Rice prices have risen, exceeding the eleven-yuan mark, and the poor who struggle daily for sustenance are crying out in distress. According to rice merchants, if it doesn't rain again, high-quality white japonica rice may reach sixteen yuan per picul. At 4:00 PM on the 13th, there was a sudden heavy rainfall. Henglin and Qishu Yan received four inches of rain. Qianzhou, Yuqi, and Beiqifang received an inch or so of rain. No raindrops fell in Bashi Bridge, Zhangjing Bridge, and Anzhen in the northern countryside, causing great disappointment to the villagers. Due to the canal drying up, inland ferries have been unable to operate and have all ceased operations since yesterday. Currently, farmers in various districts are finding their own remedies, building dams, dredging rivers, and cooperating in water pumping. Regarding the urban canals, the First District Office has decided to build three dams at the west, north, and south water gates and a water gate at the east gate, using electric power to pump water into the city from the west gate. In the future, ships transporting manure and fuel will be transshipped inside and outside the dams. However, city residents such as Zou Tongyi have raised objections, arguing that the water inside the dam is stagnant and that drinking it may be detrimental to hygiene, and that traffic will be permanently cut off. Therefore, they have sent a letter to the First District Chief Qian Zhongliang requesting a temporary delay in implementation. Yesterday (the 14th), the weather was slightly cooler, but epidemics were rampant and hospitals were very busy. People on the road often suffered from heatstroke, a phenomenon unseen in decades.</p>
<h3>You Yinzhao and Others Abducted in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>You Yin, the second son of the local gentry You Tong (Gan Chen), Zhao (Zi Ming Yizhao, currently a chief engineer at the Mechanical Department of the Ping Sui Railway), graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Nanyang University and a master's degree in civil engineering from Cornell University in the United States. He previously served as an engineer for the Jing Sui Railway and Bei Ning Railway and was noted for his work at the Shanhaiguan factory on planning the reinforcement of bridges along the entire railway and implementing the project. Last autumn, the Ministry of Railways assigned him and Long Jicheng to accompany the world-renowned Swedish scientific explorer Sven Hedin and astronomer Chen Zongqi, along with nine others, to Mongolia and Xinjiang to survey the route of the Northwest Highway. While traveling from Suiyuan to Baiairulai, he sent a daily diary back to Xishan. After sending two letters from Hami this spring on February 11, there was no further news. Later, it was learned that he was detained by Ma Zhongying's troops, with his hands tied behind his back and a gun pressed against his chest, almost to the point of danger. On the sixth of this month, You again entrusted a friend to send a telegram from Moscow to his younger brother Xun Zhao (currently a technical officer in the Nanjing Municipal Government), stating that Yin and the entire team were safe. However, the "North China Daily News" in Shanghai recently reported via telegram from Peiping that the group of nine had been abducted again by Ma Zhongying's former troops and taken to Aksu. Upon hearing the news, his father, You Tong, and his relatives were extremely worried.</p>
<h3>Leashed Female Corpse Found in River</h3>
<p>A nameless female corpse, approximately twenty years old, was found the day before yesterday in the Liujiaqiao Canal in Santang Township near Ouqiao in the Fourth District. The upper body was naked, with only a bib, and the lower body was wearing black shorts, a silk belt, white stockings, and black shoes, appearing modern. The neighborhood chief, Chen Wenyuan, reported it to the local sub-court. Prosecutor Shen led officials to conduct an on-site examination. The corpse's neck had two deep marks from hemp rope. Both hands were tied behind the back, and a millstone was tied to the back. Large stones were also tied around the waist and feet. There was no water in the abdomen, and no mud or sand in the fingernails or nostrils. It was determined that she had been strangled to death before being dumped into the river. Because no family was found, the chief was instructed to provide a coffin and burial, and to wait for the arrest of the perpetrator and further investigation. Furthermore, in the Zizania latifolia fields near Xujiang on Xingxiang Bridge, No. 596, in Bodugang, outside the South Gate, the field owner, Sheng Quan, recently installed an electric fence to deter badger damage. The other day, Zhou Jinbao's thirteen-year-old second son, A'er, from the same area, was wandering there and accidentally touched the electric fence and died. After neighborhood chief Deng Jiliang reported it to the local sub-court, Prosecutor Ren was dispatched to conduct an on-site examination and then collect the corpse. The boy's father, Zhou Jinbao, cried bitterly. The Public Security Bureau's Third Branch dispatched police to detain the field owner Zhang Shengquan and Cao Jinyuan and bring them to the court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Swarms of Locusts Found in Northeast Countryside</h3>
<p>Swarms of locusts have been found in the fields in the Zhouxiang area of the Shangshan Mountains, three miles from Anzhen in the northeast countryside of Wuxi, spreading for dozens of miles. Villagers are currently engaged in catching them and have reported to the county government for handling.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Eastern Countryside Rejoices at the Downpour</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought, people were anxious. Local gentry, in order to reassure the public, in addition to worshiping the Dragon King to pray for rain, set up a Bagua formation in the Hui Ri Temple on the 13th, inviting monks and Taoists to chant scriptures and pray for rain. County Magistrate Zhou Heng has also been visiting various rural districts with the district chiefs to inspect the drought situation and personally persuade farmers to work hard at cultivation. If it is absolutely impossible, the county will provide seeds for replanting green beans. On the afternoon of the 13th, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and residents in the urban area hoped for rain, but it did not fall by the evening. According to reports from Meili Hecun, Tangqiao, Zhao City, and Dongbang and other villages, there was a sudden downpour at 1:00 PM, delighting the farmers. However, the temperature remained high, reaching 104.5 degrees, an all-time high in decades.</p>
<h3>Wujiang: Model Widow's Sacrifice for Her Husband in Yanmu Town</h3>
<p>Shi Hongfa, who ran a wine shop on South Street in Yanmu Town, Wujiang County, remarried Zheng, a woman from a nearby village, as his wife in the third month of the lunar calendar this spring. The couple got along quite well. However, Shi suddenly fell ill and died the day before yesterday. Zheng wailed and grieved excessively, saying that she would follow her husband to the afterlife. Relatives and children thought it was just a momentary expression of grief, a common reaction, so they gave some words of comfort.</p>
<p>Without any precautionary measures, Zheng changed her clothes, bathed, and hanged herself on the bed. By the time the family rescued her, she had been dead for a long time. The two corpses were displayed side by side, and a funeral was held. Local people believe that Zheng's chastity and martyrdom are worthy of praise and plan to request an honorific.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Raising Funds to Build Dikes to Protect Against Collapse</h3>
<p>The collapse of the Nantong riverbank is becoming more severe. The Nantong District Commissioner's Office has ordered the Construction Bureau to quickly implement protection works against collapse. After surveying, it has been decided to first build stone dikes at Langshan, Pingchao, Yaogang, and the Nantong riverbank, requiring 100,000 yuan, which is currently being raised.</p>
<p>Student Army Exercises Night Combat and Imposes Curfew</p>
<p>The Nantong summer student army will conduct night combat exercises and impose a curfew in Tongcheng from 8:00 PM on the 14th to 1:00 AM on the 15th. The Security Headquarters has issued a special notice to the public to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Eighty-Year-Old Man Drowns Himself in the River</h3>
<p>Ding Kaitai, 77 years old, lived at No. 56 Dajiao Yang. Due to financial difficulties, he suddenly became world-weary. Taking advantage of his family's inattention, he drowned himself in the river at the Guanyin Nunnery on the edge of Ganlu Temple at 7:00 PM on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, the family went to the Jiaoshan Life-Saving Bureau to register and request a search. The bureau immediately sent the No. 7 Red Boat, stationed at Ganlu Temple, to make efforts to search. Ding's body was recovered on the evening of the 12th. People were immediately notified to inform the deceased's family and the Ganlu Temple neighborhood security to report to the local court for legal examination and collection of the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Zhenyi Will Open a Cooling Ferry</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been dry and hot, a phenomenon not seen in decades. Ladies and gentlemen are wandering in the heat wave, feeling restless. Although Zhenyi has famous cooling spots such as Jinjiao Ganlu and the southern suburbs, the traffic is difficult to popularize, and each trip is too expensive, beyond the financial means of most people. In view of this, the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration has leased a small ferry from the Fu Transport Bureau and converted it into a cooling ferry, which will be moored at the Fuyun Pier, Zhongzheng Road Pier, Ganlu Temple, and Jiaoshan. This is entirely for the happiness of the people of the provincial capital, so the price is very low. It is said that the round trip from Fuyun Pier to Jiaoshan will only cost half a yuan per person, and other stations will cost a dime or a few cents. It is scheduled to officially open on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: County Government Strictly Prohibits Raising Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Rice hoarding in the county has almost been exhausted, while farmers have long been reduced to poverty, unable to make ends meet. As a result, rice prices have risen particularly sharply. In the middle of last month, the highest price for winter rice was only seven yuan and forty cents per picul, but now it has gradually increased. As of yesterday, each picul had reached about eight yuan and sixty cents. If it does not rain again, the autumn harvest will be hopeless, and rice prices will continue to rise. The county government issued a notice yesterday strictly prohibiting rice merchants from taking advantage of this drought disaster to raise rice prices and affect the people's food supply, and ordered the Rice Industry Association to jointly investigate and prohibit violations, which will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Hot Weather and Cholera Epidemic</h3>
<p>The weather in Yangzhou has been extremely hot for the past twenty days. It is so hot that one cannot breathe at noon, and one cannot sleep even at night, resulting in the emergence of general acute infectious diseases. According to a recent three-day survey, more than forty people in a corner of the city have died from cholera within two or three hours, most of whom are coolies. If it does not rain again in another five days, not only will epidemics spread, but the drinking water supply in towns and villages far from the canal will also become a problem. As for agricultural harvests, that is no longer a matter for immediate concern.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Rampant Banditry in the Ninth District</h3>
<p>The ninth district of the county has been plagued by bandits for years, and the farmers are suffering greatly. Last year, bandit gangs caused the most damage. After the county government dispatched teams to garrison Xuguangzhuang and other places to hold them, there were no traces of bandits. The other day, Director Xiang of the Provincial Security Office visited You to inspect the police force. The local police force was ordered to return to the city, but the bandits returned, looting the residents of Anjisi and Gengtianzhuang, and kidnapped Mu Rugan of Mujiazhuang, demanding a ransom of 2,000 yuan. They also set fire to several oil shacks.</p>
<h3>Youlin Merchant Ship Looted by Bandits</h3>
<p>The Youlin merchant ship departed from the city for Linze the day before yesterday. However, when it reached the Wuwen Port area of the Fourth District, it was suddenly ambushed by more than ten bandits who fired shots to warn and ordered it to stop. The bandits jumped aboard the merchant ship and searched it thoroughly. No passengers were spared, and all silver, goods, and cargo were looted. Before leaving, they also kidnapped the passenger Ding Deming and fled to the southeast.</p>
<h3>Hot Weather and Rising Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been little rainfall in the county. After half an inch of rain at the end of last month, it has not rained for many days, causing great damage to crops in the countryside. As a result, rice mills in the city arbitrarily raised rice prices. Superior rice rose from 7.2 yuan to 9.8 yuan, medium rice from 6.4 yuan to 8.6 yuan, and inferior rice from 5.8 yuan to 8 yuan. The general public was alarmed. If it does not rain again, rice prices will continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang: Tian Zhangshi Murders Her Husband</h3>
<p>In Baimuqiao West Street, Sixth District, there is Tian Daguan, 52 years old, who married Zhang, who is 51 years old. Daguan's father, Bao Jiayun, died early, and his mother, Geng, remarried Tang Futing from Taixing (now 71 years old), who runs the Taihe Heng dyeing workshop to make a living. In 1923, Daguan was arrested and imprisoned for robbery and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released this spring after the National Government issued a general pardon, reducing his sentence by one-third. After returning home, he was at odds with his stepfather Tang Futing, his wife Zhang, and his daughter-in-law Lu, and conflicts often arose. He even threatened to kill his wife and daughter-in-law and burn down the house. His wife, terrified, decided to strike first. Yesterday late at night, taking advantage of Daguan's drunken sleep, she strangled him to death with a piece of white cloth. The neighbors discovered this and reported it to the town guard Mao Sen, who put the suspect under surveillance. A preliminary examination was conducted by Investigator Bao Chengshen. The main suspect, Tian Zhangshi, and accomplices Tang Futing, Tian Lu, and Lu Mingqing were all taken into custody for interrogation.</p>
<h3>County Government Issues Arrest Warrant for Shen Hualong</h3>
<p>Shen Hualong, the former captain of the 16th Water Police Brigade, was caught transporting opium in our county, along with three members of the team: Xi Hongsheng, Zhang Fengwu, and Wang Bingsheng, who were sentenced in the case. Later, Mei Xian accused Shen Hualong in a complaint to the county government.</p>
<p>Because he has repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned, an arrest warrant has been issued.</p>
<h3>Cixi: Meteorite Falls Amidst Severe Drought</h3>
<p>At about 9:00 PM the other day, a strange star suddenly appeared in the eastern sky of our county. It was as big as a small bowl, with a black shadow in the center and radiating light, flickering and unsteady. Its brightness was stronger than ordinary stars. Because it was still early, most people enjoying the cool air saw it. It lasted for about seven or eight minutes and then suddenly fell and disappeared. People discussed it a lot. Some said it was a drought demon star descending, a harbinger of drought and famine. An old farmer named Zhou spoke even more emphatically, saying that this star had fallen once in a certain year during the Qing Dynasty, and that year was a great drought. This year, it hasn't rained for a long time, and this star has descended again. We will record this and await the research of scientists.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Severe Drought in Mogan Mountain Causes Drinking Water Problems</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been hot, and the number of people going to Mogan Mountain to escape the heat has reached 4,500, and many more are going up the mountain every day. However, due to the lack of rain, the water source has been greatly reduced. The water needed by residents in Gangtou and Yinshan Heng is taken from the two water pipes in Luhuadang. Coolies carry buckets of water and trudge along the rugged mountain paths, working hard in the scorching heat. They flock to that place to fetch water, scrambling to be first. If it doesn't rain again, and the number of people going to the mountains to escape the heat continues to increase, the future is worrying.</p>

<h3>Local News: Kong Xiangxi Explains the New Tariff Rules: Revised Cautiously After Careful Study by Experts; Impressed by this Trip to Inspect Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai by plane on the evening of the 13th. Officials and staff of the Finance Ministry's Shanghai offices visited his private residence on the morning of the 14th to report. At 9:30, Kong went to the Central Bank to handle official business. Around 11:00, he met with reporters from various newspapers and made the following statement:</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Finances of Various Provinces</h3>
<p>According to Kong, he was very impressed by his trip to inspect the finances of the various provinces in North China, and he was especially pleased with the goodwill of the people towards the government. Due to the urgency of time, he was unable to personally inspect the border provinces such as Suiyuan, which he regretted. However, in order to understand the details of the various provinces, he dispatched personnel to inspect the places he had not personally visited, so as to know the details for reference in reform. The financial authorities of the various provinces and cities in North China were able to make efforts to implement the cases resolved at the National Financial Conference, which was gratifying. As for the abolition of various kinds of miscellaneous taxes in the provinces and cities, which has been officially implemented since July 1, many have been abolished, and it is expected that they can be completely abolished in a short period of time. Kong also said that the number of various kinds of miscellaneous taxes in the provinces and cities is countless. In Shanxi Province alone, more than 6 million yuan of miscellaneous taxes can be abolished annually, reducing the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Revising Import Tariffs</h3>
<p>The new tariff rules promulgated by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Have caused misunderstandings among some businessmen who have requested amendments. It has also been reported that</p>
<p>Some businessmen in Shanghai will send representatives to Beijing to petition him. If this is true, he should explain in detail to dispel doubts and to let people know the Ministry of Finance's caution in revising the tariff rules. Kong continued, saying that the revision of these new tariff rules had been carefully studied by Chinese and foreign experts for as long as six months, and the Ministry of Finance had revised them as many as four times. After the Ministry of Finance made a decision, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then to the Central Political Conference for review and approval before promulgation. He believes that these new tariff rules can take into account the interests of all parties. As for the increase in tariffs on machinery in the new tariff rules, it is because our country was previously unable to manufacture its own machinery, but now it is gradually able to do so, so the tariffs are increased to provide protection. As for printed fabrics, a type of cotton textile, because our country does not produce them, the tariffs have been reduced appropriately. All such increases and decreases are very reasonable.</p>
<h3>Rescuing the Rong Family's Factories</h3>
<p>Finally, Kong said that he likes to travel by nature and has visited the Yangtze River and North China in recent years, so he has decided to visit South China when he has some free time in government affairs, but the travel date has not yet been determined. As for the factories run by Rong Zongjing, a giant flour merchant, the government has decided to provide relief, and at a minimum, it will not allow them to shut down. He has just returned from North China and does not yet know the details of the factory's situation and the government's relief measures. Kong plans to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Four Bureaus Form Drought Prevention Committee, Address on Ninghe Road; Office Starts Work Today</h3>
<p>The municipal government proposed a discussion on drought prevention and relief measures at the municipal affairs meeting the other day. It was resolved to organize a Shanghai Drought Prevention Committee, with representatives from the four bureaus of Social Affairs, Finance, Public Security, and Land as members. The Social Affairs Bureau has appointed Section Chief Wu Huanru, and the Finance Bureau has appointed Section Chief Shen Tong. The office has decided to be located in the Also Garden on Ninghe Road in the South City and will officially begin work today.</p>
<h3>Telephone Service Between Zhejiang and Shanghai to Begin Tomorrow; Regulations Promulgated</h3>
<p>According to Heping News Agency, with the exception of Nanjing, long-distance telephone service between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, connecting neighboring provinces, is generally lacking. As Shanghai's telephone service is managed by the Ministry of Communications, it currently only extends to Hangzhou. To facilitate long-distance telephone service between various locations in Zhejiang Province and neighboring provinces, the Provincial Telephone Bureau and the relevant authorities have agreed on mutually beneficial measures for telephone and telegraph communication. It has now been decided that starting tomorrow (the 16th), Shanghai will begin providing telephone service to various locations in Zhejiang Province. New rates are being drafted and will be announced soon. Simultaneously, the Provincial Telephone Bureau will begin accepting and forwarding telegrams. Yesterday, the Provincial Telephone Bureau issued instructions to its local branches regarding the procedures for handling telephone service between Zhejiang Province and Shanghai, to be implemented starting on the 16th of this month. These procedures are outlined below: (1) Registered users of local telephones in Hangzhou and other cities in Zhejiang Province can connect to Shanghai long-distance service through their local telephone. (2) Those who purchase retail telephone tickets from the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau and its branches (hereinafter referred to as "Provincial Bureau") can connect to Shanghai long-distance service through retail telephones or designated local telephones. (3) The duration of calls between Shanghai and Zhejiang is measured in units of five minutes or less, starting from the time the called party answers. Calls lasting more than five minutes but up to ten minutes will be counted as two units. Continuous calls are limited to two units. (4) For long-distance calls from the Provincial Bureau to Shanghai or from Shanghai to the Provincial Bureau, the called party must have a local telephone. Calls will not be made to parties without a telephone. (5) The charges for calls between Shanghai and Zhejiang will be calculated as follows: Hangzhou to Shanghai County will be charged according to the established rates. All other lines of the Provincial Bureau will be charged according to the Provincial Bureau's established rates. (6)</p>
<p>For the Feng-Hang line and other bureaus, with the exception of Hangzhou and the Jia-Wu line bureaus, all calls to and from Shanghai will be relayed through the Jiaxing branch line. The rates for the Shanghai-Jiaxing segment will be charged according to the Ministry of Communications regulations, while the remaining segments will be charged according to the Provincial Bureau's regulations. (7) The Ministry of Communications' Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance trunk line's charges and other procedures for the above telephone services will be handled according to the provisions of these measures, unless otherwise specified herein, and otherwise according to the Ministry of Communications' General Rules for Long-Distance Telephone Service. (8) Both parties shall meticulously record the number of calls and charges, and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau shall reconcile and settle accounts monthly. Detailed procedures shall be formulated through mutual consultation and submitted for approval. (9) These measures shall take effect on July 16, 1934. Matters not covered herein may be amended through mutual consultation.</p>
<h3>Lin Shi Sets Sail for France Yesterday to Take Up His New Post</h3>
<p>Lin Shi, the newly appointed Chinese Consul General in Paris, France, departed yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM aboard the French ship "Peileike" to take up his new post. Mr. Lin boarded the ship at the Osaka Wharf around 3:00 PM. Huang Naishu, the Director of the Postal Department, Guo Xincong, the Director-General of the Postal Administration, Tang Baoshu, the Director of the Postal Savings Bureau, and his relatives and friends were all present to see him off.</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama Cables His Gratitude for Receptions</h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama has concluded discussions with the central government in Beijing regarding the propagation of Buddhism since his arrival in the capital. He departed by plane yesterday morning for Ping, en route to the Yi-Ke-Zhao League to propagate Buddhism. The day before yesterday (the 13th), the Panchen Lama sent a telegram to Mayor Wu to bid farewell. The original telegram is reproduced below:</p>
<p>(Omitted titles) During my previous visit to Shanghai, I received generous hospitality from you, my brother, and friends from all walks of life, which is deeply appreciated. After returning to Beijing, my correspondence was lacking, and I offer my sincere apologies. Now that my affairs in Beijing are completed, I will depart for Mongolia tomorrow morning to propagate Buddhism. I respectfully send this telegram to express my gratitude and wish you well, and I pray that you will convey my regards to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial National Products Exhibition Postponed; Opening Delayed to the 25th; Due to Hot Weather, Exhibition Venue Not Completed as Scheduled; Notice from the Manufacturers' Association Announcing Postponement to the 25th</h3>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, a certain high-ranking official who arrived in Shanghai from Beijing was questioned about the issue of Central Committee member Hu Hanmin's overseas inspection. He stated that it is difficult to determine whether Mr. Hu will go abroad, but various parties strongly hope that he will do so, as Mr. Hu has resided in Hong Kong in recent years, and it is inevitable that he will be exploited by other parties.

<h3>Military and Police Agencies Strictly Prohibit Riding Without Tickets; Garrison Command and Public Security Bureau Issue Notices; China General Omnibus Company Offers Preferential Treatment to Military and Police</h3>
<p>The China General Omnibus Company of Nanshi, in order to facilitate public transportation and business, has found that soldiers and public officials ride without tickets, resulting in significant financial losses. The company has petitioned the Songhu Garrison Commander and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to reiterate the prohibition and issue notices to be posted inside the buses, strictly prohibiting riding without tickets. Fearing that some may still refuse to purchase tickets, the 2nd Regiment of the Shanghai Garrison has dispatched military police, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau has assigned inspectors to travel on the buses of the China General Omnibus Company starting on the 16th of this month to enforce the regulations and maintain order. The texts of the notices from the military and police authorities are as follows: (1) Notice from the Songhu Garrison Command: For the purpose of issuing a notice, the China General Omnibus Company has petitioned for the issuance of a notice prohibiting soldiers from riding without tickets and has proposed preferential treatment for soldiers, allowing soldiers in uniform with insignia to ride in second-class carriages at half price. After review, it is deemed feasible. Therefore, this notice is issued. Hereafter, soldiers riding the bus must comply with the above regulations and purchase half-price tickets to alleviate the financial difficulties of the company and are not allowed to ride without tickets. Those who dare to violate this will be severely punished. This notice is issued by Commander Wu Tiecheng. (2) Notice from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau: For the purpose of issuing a notice, the China General Omnibus Company has petitioned for the issuance of a notice prohibiting public officials from riding without tickets to maintain traffic and business. After investigation, buses are intended to facilitate public transportation, and all passengers should purchase tickets in accordance with the regulations to alleviate the financial difficulties of the company. Recently, police officers of this bureau have often occupied seats without purchasing tickets, allowing cunning individuals to impersonate the bureau in an attempt to evade payment, harming the company's business and affecting public transportation, which is inappropriate. Based on the aforementioned petition, in addition to the instructions, this notice is issued to all officers, who must comply. Hereafter, unless the company has other preferential policies for police officers, they must all purchase tickets in accordance with the regulations to maintain traffic and comply with the regulations. Those who dare to violate this will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Participate in the Brussels World's Fair</h3>

<h3>Organizing a Mobile National Products Pawnshop</h3>

<h3>Municipal Committee in Each District Urgently Requests the Municipal Government to Protect Human Rights; People's Lawsuits Should First Investigate the Original Plaintiff</h3>
<p>The municipal committee members of each district of Shanghai, Yang Xinzheng, Chen Tianxi, Wang Hui, Zhang Qiwen, Pan Hongding, Wu Xuen, Gu Shanzhang, Tang Chengzong, Zhu Jiajun, Zhu Zongluo, Zhou Nianzu, Ling Zhibin, Hong Lanxiang, Wang Shouyu, and others, jointly petitioned the municipal government and the garrison headquarters yesterday to prevent the filing of false accusations by first investigating the original plaintiffs in lawsuits. The original text is as follows: "It is an established rule that those who commit crimes among the people should be thoroughly investigated if they are reported. This is not only a fundamental principle in countries that value the rule of law, but also a crucial aspect for those who seek to achieve clear and just governance throughout history and across different countries. However, in these degenerate times, social morals have declined, and people's hearts have become treacherous, leading to situations where investigation is simply impossible. Even a slight grudge can lead to false accusations. Insidious individuals often use anonymous postings as tools for attack, while ruthless individuals do not hesitate to plant evidence or engage in slanderous accusations. Government agencies aim to eliminate evil and must conduct thorough investigations, but they may inadvertently fall into traps set by cunning individuals. By the time the truth is revealed, the physical freedom, property, and reputation of the accused have already suffered immeasurable damage. If grievances cannot be redressed and right cannot be distinguished from wrong, the situation becomes increasingly hopeless, and injustices sink to the bottom of the sea. Although our country's constitution is still being drafted, the provisional constitution has long guaranteed the people's freedom of person, residence, and property, and stipulates that punishment or unlawful arrest should not be imposed except in accordance with the law. This is essential to protect the people's rights and interests. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly emphasized the importance of people's rights in his Three Principles of the People. As we focus on the rule of law, implement the Three Principles of the People, and transition from political tutelage to constitutional governance, how can we neglect the people's rights and interests? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has issued a directive to all regions, requiring that people's accusations against officials be based on solid evidence. By extension, mutual accusations among the people must also be based on solid evidence. Otherwise, those who are eager to cause trouble will excel at framing others, and anonymous postings will proliferate everywhere. Fortunately, if the government does not investigate, the senders of these postings will suffer no harm. However, if the government investigates based on these postings, the accused may be summoned, detained, or even have their homes searched and their reputations ruined, suffering undue harm. Imagine someone being falsely accused of selling or consuming morphine. If a bag of lime or powder is found in their home, it cannot be identified immediately and can only be confirmed after the case is investigated or analyzed. Before the verdict is reached, it is difficult to release the accused. What is the extent of their physical and mental suffering? Similarly, falsely reporting banditry or communism can be terrifying. If the person who framed the accused can be found, they can be punished for making a false accusation, even if the accused has suffered temporary pain. Otherwise, even if the case is resolved, how will the accused be compensated for their suffering? This will only embolden troublemakers and make everyone feel insecure. In light of this, and for the sake of protecting the people's rights and interests, the committee members dare to offer their heartfelt words. We earnestly request that you order the Public Security Bureau to first investigate the original plaintiffs in lawsuits. If the accusations are not false, then accept the case to prevent cunning individuals from harming the innocent and protecting the good. We humbly await your command."</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation Submits Petition to Abolish Electric Shock Torture to Uphold Legal Authority and Protect People's Lives</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation submitted a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday, stating: "The petition concerns the abusive use of electric shock torture by the police, which cripples and kills people. We respectfully request that the Ministry investigate and address this issue strictly to uphold legal authority and protect people's lives. Torture has long been abolished in our country. However, the police in the Shanghai Concession have resumed this practice and even intensified it. Regardless of the case, any defendant who is arrested is subjected to electric shock torture to force a confession, which is then used as evidence of the defendant's own admission. Judges, without conducting proper investigations, are deceived by this practice and attach the confession to the case file as the basis for their verdict. Later, if the defendant wishes to argue their innocence, the questioners are already biased, making it difficult to overturn the verdict. The police's plan is thus successful, and the use of electric shock torture becomes widespread. The police's authority is limited to assisting the court in making arrests. After the arrest, they should be sent to the court for legal proceedings and have no need to force a confession. What is the police's intention in using this cruel electric shock torture? This is something that the association is not in a position to know. However, since the police began using electric shock torture to force confessions, countless innocent people have been framed. Recent cases such as those of Cai Yangqi and Chen Afu provide clear evidence to support this claim. Since the establishment of the Special District Court, much of the lost legal authority has been recovered. If this inhuman electric shock torture is not stopped, not only will people's lives be in danger, but legal authority will also be lost. For the sake of the country's legal authority and the people's lives, the association cannot remain silent. In addition to submitting separate reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government requesting them to lodge protests, we have also prepared a document to submit to the Ministry, respectfully requesting that you investigate and instruct the court to pay strict attention to this issue to uphold legal authority and protect people's lives. We are deeply grateful." The association submitted separate reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, and also sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association requesting that they lodge a strong protest with the Public Works Department. The original texts are largely the same and are omitted.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Hits Rickshaw, Two Children Injured and Killed: Russian Child Testifies Truck Was on the Wrong Route, Public Bus Could Not Avoid the Accident</h3>
<p>Guangdong woman Cao Chen, along with her son Yonghong, age seven, and daughter Ai Kuan, age four, were riding in two rickshaws on Qu Ning Road and Zhapu Road, heading east to west, at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday. At the same time, truck No. 16442, driven by Yang Kaimu, was also speeding west. However, the truck should have been traveling on the south side of the road, but it was traveling on the north side. At that time, public bus No. 15133, driven by Wu Jintang, was coming from the west. The two vehicles were about to collide, so Wu immediately turned the bus to the south side in an attempt to avoid the collision. However, the brakes failed, and the bus hit the two rickshaws one after another. Cao Chen and her two children were thrown from the rickshaws and were severely injured by the bus. The police arrived and recorded the numbers of the two vehicles and telephoned the Hongkou police station, ordering an ambulance to rush Ms. Cao and her three children to the Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment. However, the two children died due to their severe injuries. The police ordered detectives to investigate and took the two drivers back to the police station for detention. The bodies of the two children were sent to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent the two drivers to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District District Court for public prosecution. Judge Xiao briefly interrogated them and adjourned the hearing. At around 10:00 AM, the prosecutor's office dispatched prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue for examination. After examining the bodies, they took testimony from a witness, Yiqin Bolang (transliteration), age twelve, a Russian resident of Park Lane and a student, who stated, "I happened to be passing by the area that day and saw the truck was on the wrong route. The public bus, fearing a collision, turned to the south and hit the two rickshaws. The truck was traveling very fast, and the public bus was traveling at a normal speed. I did not hear any horns from either vehicle. The truck did not stop after the accident." The father of the deceased, Cao Ziran, age thirty-six, a resident of No. 46 Dongbaoxing Road, Zhabei, and an employee at an oil factory, stated that the deceased were his children and that he was unaware of the accident at the time. He demanded compensation for all losses. Mr. Guo then questioned the two drivers and ruled that the boy, Cao Chenghong, and the girl, Cao Ai Kuan, had died from head and abdominal injuries caused by public bus No. 15133. Since truck driver Yang Kaimu and public bus driver Wu Jintang had already been publicly prosecuted by the police, they should be sent to the court for review. The bodies of the two children were handed over to their father, Cao Ziran, with a guarantee, to be taken back for coffin preparation.</p>
<h3>Two Pirate Ships Rob Rice, Open Fire, and Kill a Crew Member; Small Boat Carrying Rice Encounters Robbers, Four Crew Members One Dead, Two Injured</h3>
<p>Boatman Wang Botao has been purchasing rice in the interior and transporting it to Shanghai for sale. Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been rising, and he has made considerable profits from transporting rice from the interior three times in a row. The day before yesterday, he purchased more than 180 shi of rice from rural households in Wujiang and immediately set sail for Shanghai to sell it. Wang instructed his crew to travel day and night to reach Shanghai as soon as possible. Wang first took a train from Suzhou to Shanghai to contact merchants and negotiate sales. On the day before yesterday, Wang's boat was being sailed by his crew to a river near Dagang. The river's water level was low due to the prolonged drought, and the boat was grounded and unable to move. Seeing that the boat was grounded, the crew planned to wait for high tide to set sail. To their surprise, even when the tide rose in the afternoon, the boat was still unable to move. Since the boat's draft was very deep, the crew was about to hire a boat to transfer half of the rice to lighten the load and allow the boat to move when two small boats suddenly arrived in the evening. The crew, seeing that they looked like local boats, did not suspect anything and immediately asked the two small boats to carry the rice, agreeing to transport it to the Mao River. The two small boats agreed. Wang's crew transferred more than 80 shi of rice from the boat to the two small boats. After the transfer, the boat was lighter and able to move. The two small boats sailed ahead, and Wang's boat followed behind. Unexpectedly, when they reached the Mao River, the two small boats quickly raised their sails and sped away. Wang's crew ordered them to stop, but they ignored the order and continued to sail away. Wang's crew raised their sails to chase them and were about to catch up when the two small boats fired five or six shots at Wang's boat, killing one crew member and injuring two others. The boat was also hit by the shots. Of the four crew members on Wang's boat, only one was uninjured. At this point, they dared not chase any further and had to stop. The two pirate ships fled west. The crew reported the incident to the anti-smuggling patrol boat, which immediately gave chase. Yesterday, the crew arrived in Shanghai and reported the incident to the boat owner, Wang. Upon receiving the report, Wang immediately went to Gaoqiao and informed the family of the crew member who had been killed. They went to the boat together to prepare the body for transport back for burial. It is reported that the loss is estimated to be around 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local Fruit Merchants Actively Develop Fruit Trade Organize Trade Companies and Economic Control Association for Pears and Hawthorns Standardize Tianjin Chestnut Prices and Organize Public Sales Market</h3>
<p>China is located in the temperate zone with a warm climate, making it ideal for growing fruits. The Guangju oranges and Tianjin chestnuts produced here have long been famous at home and abroad. However, due to improper management, they have not been fully developed. Local fruit merchants are aware of this and are actively seeking ways to improve the situation. Recently, they have advocated for the public sale of Tianjin chestnuts, the organization of an economic control association for pears and hawthorns, and the establishment of trade companies to achieve the goal of development. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Sale of Tianjin Chestnuts Has Become a Reality: Tianjin Liangxiang's chestnuts are fragrant, tender, and delicious, and are widely sold. The annual sales volume in this city has been in the tens of millions of dan or more. Since the profits are considerable, various merchants have engaged in fierce competition, causing the prices to fluctuate greatly, which has seriously harmed the market. Therefore, the local Fruit and Produce Trade Association has organized a public sales market for Tianjin chestnuts to set a precedent for standardized prices. Various organizational strategies have been formulated. The market is located at No. 16 Pu Iron Anchor Lane. The prices are determined by the fruit firms of Huitai, Yuankang, and Liang Dongsheng. The business hours are set from 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily.</p>
<p>Actively Organize Trade Companies: This city is located in a strategic location with people from home and abroad gathered here. The consumption of fruits is the highest in the country, and trade is frequent. Although there were previously one or two import merchants managing these matters, they lacked competition and experience, resulting in a lack of progress. Furthermore, the matters entrusted by fruit merchants often failed due to various barriers. Therefore, it was decided to organize a trade company named Youhua, specializing in the import and export of fruits. It has already been established and is of great scale.</p>
<p>Establish Economic Control Committee for Pears and Hawthorns: According to the person in charge of the Fruit and Produce Trade Association, the pears and hawthorns needed in this city are mostly produced in Tianjin Teng County and Nanjing, with those produced in Xihe, Yuhe, and Botou being particularly good. Currently, the fruit industry has organized an economic control association for pears and hawthorns to control the trade of pears and hawthorns. There are currently twenty-one merchants who have joined, and recently two more companies, Xie Feng and Tai Feng, have joined, making the organization very tight-knit.</p>
<p>Notice to Members Requiring Payment of Security Deposits: The local Fruit and Produce Trade Association issued a notice yesterday stating that the association's fourth member meeting had resolved to organize an economic control association for pears and hawthorns and to handle matters in accordance with the draft plan presented by the county. The organization has been completed and a meeting was convened with related businesses on June 22. At the meeting, it was decided that Bao Cheng, Ling Feng, Dong Shenglong, Yi Yuande, Yuankang, Yongda, Shengda, Xie Yuan, Huitai, Xie Mao, and Wufeng would be Type A members and would be required to pay a security deposit of 500 yuan. Long Mao, He Kang, Yonghe, Zhang Hengmao, Dasheng, Tong Xiangmao, Qianji, Yongfeng, Xie Shengyuan, and Yuanfeng would be Type B members and would be required to pay a security deposit of 300 yuan with a monthly interest rate of 7%, and to sign a membership contract by the deadline. All security deposits must be paid in full by July 10. The sales volume and amount of Tianjin Botou Teng County Nanjing Jinan pears and hawthorns (excluding Qingdao and Yantai) sold in the last three years, from July 20 to June 23, must be submitted to the association for review by July 10, along with the records for the past three years, to compile the total amount and determine the standard ratio. All members are hereby notified to comply with this notice. Please do not delay the submission of the required information. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Arbitrarily Releases Detained Suspect; Paramour Flees and Does Not Return; Qin Guo Shi Secretly Flees from Her Husband; Gu Jin Song is Freed; Police Officer Zhu Yuan Ji Takes Custody</h3>
<p>Qin Zhao Yu, from Gao You, resides at No. 204, Yue Zhou Road, Yang Shu Pu. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he married Guo Shi, a woman from the same village. They had a son who is now only three years old, and their relationship was quite good. However, although Guo Shi came from a humble background, she was not unattractive. As a result, many lecherous men pursued her. Guo Shi was also known for her promiscuity, seemingly open to anyone being her husband. Her scandalous reputation spread far and wide. Now, she became intimate with a man named Gu Jin Song and suddenly, on the 17th day of the lunar May, she secretly fled from her husband without a trace. Her mother asked a neighbor, Liu Qing Zhi, to find her. Liu, in turn, entrusted Ye A Kun and Jing Yuan Gui to search in all directions. They learned that Guo Shi and Gu Jin Song had rented a house in the Zhong Xing Road area, and they reported this to Qin Zhao Yu. The day before yesterday, Qin went to the address and found Gu, but Guo Shi had already escaped. Gu was taken to the fifth district police station on Heng Bang Road and temporarily detained. Shortly afterward, Liu Qing Zhi, accompanied by Gu Jin Song's aunt, Gu Zheng Shi, went to the police station to visit. Liu discussed with the guard, police officer Zhu Yuan Ji, to swap Gu Zheng Shi for Gu Jin Song, allowing him to go out and find Qin Guo Shi. Unexpectedly, Gu Jin Song left and did not return. The next day, when Qin Zhao Yu went to the police station to request the arrest of Qin Guo Shi, he discovered that the captured Gu Jin Song had been secretly released. Based on this information, he reported to the Fifth District Police Bureau to detain Liu Qing Zhi, Gu Zheng Shi, and the police officer Zhu Yuan Ji, who had arbitrarily released the suspect. During interrogation, Zhu Yuan Ji confessed that Gu Jin Song, who was in custody, was guaranteed by the familiar Liu Qing Zhi, who brought Gu's aunt, Gu Zheng Shi, to swap places, so that Gu could find and return Qin Guo Shi. Liu Qing Zhi claimed that he had served in the police force before the January 28th Incident, which is why he knew Zhu, but denied acting as a guarantor. Yesterday morning, upon instruction, the plaintiff Qin Zhao Yu, witnesses Ye A Kun and Jing Yuan Gui, and the defendants Zhu Yuan Ji, Liu Qing Zhi, and Gu Zheng Shi were all transferred to the local court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Drought Causes Rivers to Run Shallow; Vegetable and Melon Prices Rise</h3>
<p>This summer has been plagued by a severe drought. Despite prayers for rain from various charitable organizations, no rain has fallen. Although there were clouds the day before yesterday, the sun quickly reappeared, making the heat unbearable. Recently, farmers have been irrigating their fields day and night, causing rivers to gradually dry up. Watermelons and other melons lack natural rain irrigation, so the water quality is also inferior to previous years. Ships find it difficult to navigate, and the number of tugboats operated by shipping companies has decreased, leading to a gradual reduction in supply. According to the local Produce Trade Association, if it does not rain in the next week, the supply of various vegetables in the city will inevitably decrease, and market prices will rise. Melon prices are already one-third higher than last week. If it does not rain in the next week, shallow rivers will prevent ships from passing, reducing the number of vessels and cutting off supplies. The demand for vegetables and melons in the city will inevitably exceed supply.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Issue Rickshaw Licenses Based on Ownership Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided that, starting in August, applications for public rickshaw (yellow rickshaw) licenses (also known as permits) will only be granted to those who hold an ownership certificate issued by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. The ownership certificates have already been scheduled for issuance in June and July, and rickshaw owners are requested to apply on the designated dates. As of now, applications for approximately 700 certificates have been received. However, the actual number of applications received from rickshaw owners is less than this number. As a result, some public rickshaw licenses may be suspended or issued to other rickshaw owners who are willing to fully comply with the Council's regulations.</p>
<p>Because some existing rickshaw owners refuse to apply for certificates, there may be some changes in the rickshaw business, and there may be a temporary shortage of vehicles. However, the Council is determined to implement its measures and prevent all illegal or intimidating actions. Due to the refusal of rickshaw owners to apply for certificates, some rickshaw pullers may suffer unemployment. Therefore, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has decided that if the number of applications from existing rickshaw owners is insufficient, it will accept applications from new rickshaw owners or allow existing rickshaw owners who are willing to comply with the Council's regulations to request an expansion of their fleet. These requests must be submitted between July 25th and 29th, either by mail or special delivery, to Office 512 in the Shanghai Municipal Council General Office, addressed to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. A receipt will be issued. The application must include the name (or names in the case of a partnership), address, guarantor, and the number of vehicles the applicant wishes to operate. All applicants must comply with the Council's newly established regulations for public rickshaw licenses. The Council will give priority to issuing licenses to those who are willing to cooperate in establishing a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Guild Issues Declaration; Refutes the Rickshaw Committee's Measures Point by Point</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Special District Office, dissatisfied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee's nitpicking, resolved in a special committee meeting to invite people from all walks of life at a set time. Yesterday, it issued a declaration stating: "We, the rickshaw merchants, have had a long and distinguished history of several decades since the start of our business. We have always been under the direct jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Office. Rickshaw owners are diligent and thrifty, and rickshaw pullers work day and night. As a result, the business has developed day by day, and everyone has lived in peace. Who knew that this would stir the desire for wealth in one or two Westerners, coupled with the encouragement of unscrupulous Chinese, and the Rickshaw Affairs Committee came into being. The Committee, under the guise of saving rickshaw pullers and improving rickshaw affairs, has been promoting itself everywhere as a savior for rickshaw pullers, but the result is equal to zero, only fulfilling the Committee members' massive monthly salaries of thousands of gold coins. What is most surprising is that the measures and plans formulated by the Committee are completely incompatible with the customs of the rickshaw industry, with nothing right about them. It is truly like building a car behind closed doors, never getting on the right track. Now, we will select the main points from the Committee's sixteen measures, which it considers successful, for comment (so that it can be known that the Committee is stealing the superficiality of social theories, which is absolutely not conducive to practical application). For example, in the Committee's first, second, and third articles, it is stated that the original rickshaws of each rickshaw owner will be gradually reduced year by year and handed over to another new rickshaw company for operation. May we ask, is this kind of action applicable in any country? Even before or after the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, has there ever been such administrative action? It must be known that even a single rickshaw is a life and property, and it must not be unconditionally taken back or given to another operator at will. Fortunately, the authorities deeply understand that it is impractical and have generally reserved and shelved it. The phrase 'genuine rickshaw owner' in the fifth article on registration is even more nitpicking. It must be known that a rickshaw owner is always a rickshaw owner, there is no such thing as genuine or fake. The former system of paying donations on behalf of others was stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, requiring at least twenty rickshaws to establish a guarantee, and requiring a reliable shop guarantee or additional payment of a deposit. It was absolutely impossible for rickshaw owners with a small number of rickshaws to directly report the donation. They could only combine several rickshaw owners with a small number of rickshaws to form an integer and report the donation to the Shanghai Municipal Council on their behalf. In fact, it only facilitated the Shanghai Municipal Council's handling procedures. For decades, responsibilities have been distinguished and have not been disrupted. It can be seen that the system of paying donations on behalf of others, although not satisfactory to the newly established Rickshaw Affairs Committee, has also been meritorious. The sixth article on registering rickshaw pullers and improving rickshaws is the responsibility of the Rickshaw Affairs Office and is absolutely not a way to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers. How can it be mentioned together? The Committee's view is so naive and pathetic. The eighth article, under the guise of registering rickshaw pullers, actually requires rickshaw pullers to pay a registration fee, which is extremely despicable. At a time when trams and cars are competing for passengers, the ninth article actually wants to increase rickshaw fares. Its intention is vicious, actually driving fish into the deep sea and reducing the business of rickshaw pullers. The ninth and tenth articles are even more obvious acts of sabotage. If new rickshaws are replaced, they should be gradually replaced from old and worn rickshaws. It is absolutely impossible to stamp a new rickshaw shell today and change the new rickshaw style tomorrow. These significant losses are all borne by the rickshaw owners, which is of no benefit to the country or the people. The fifteenth article severely cracks down on illegal rickshaws, benefiting public rickshaw pullers. Who knew that there would be no action for several months? It is well known that illegal rickshaws are a personal scourge to public rickshaw pullers. Thirty percent of the floating capital under transportation goes to illegal rickshaws. If the authorities are willing to do their duty, they should have made an expression long ago. It is easy and pleasant, why not do it? It can rectify the rickshaw regulations and increase the income of public rickshaw pullers. The Committee makes empty promises of relief and liberation, only looking for flaws in form and color. In the end, it sacrifices the property of rickshaw merchants, reduces much prosperity in the market, and fulfills the titles of several sociologists. Now the Shanghai Municipal Council does not remember the past achievements of the rickshaw merchants and is alarmed by the alarmist talk of one or two people. It has specially formed a redundant organization with high positions and high salaries, buying peace and quiet. Originally, the Committee members are all sociologists who have always been well-fed and well-housed, sitting high and grand. They must not have dreamed of the lives of rickshaw pullers and the work of the lower class, let alone experienced it in person. They only make contradictory claims based on empty ideals, which are impractical and unreasonable. For half a year, the rickshaw pullers have not received blessings, and the rickshaw merchants have suffered endlessly. We had no choice but to convene a general meeting of all rickshaw owners on June 18th, together with the Council, and unanimously decided to organize a special committee of the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association Special District Office, so as to concentrate our efforts and carry out negotiations. All illegal points and contradictory claims of the Committee will be corrected. After the Committee realizes and corrects, we will accept them. Finally, we also intend to appeal to all sectors for assistance, make a practical expression of strength, awaken public opinion, and make a fair criticism. Our Association represents all rickshaw owners in their unanimous struggle, fighting for their last lives. At present, the summer season has arrived. Regarding the temporary relief, our Association, based on the spirit of mutual assistance, attaches importance to actual implementation. In addition to depositing the existing 50,000 gold coins with the custody committee for safekeeping, we still ask the rickshaw owners' general meeting and the Council to continue to provide medical care, medicine, coffins, and tea to seek the happiness of rickshaw pullers. We hereby declare this, hoping for your public attention."</p>
<h3>Extreme Heat Causes Pedestrians in Zhabei to Collapse and Die</h3>
<p>Jiang Shun Qing, 51 years old, from Funing, earned a living by working. Yesterday afternoon, while passing through Xin Yu Li near Heng Feng Bridge in Zhabei, he suddenly collapsed and died from heatstroke. A police officer on duty at the Fourth District, Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau noticed this and reported the collapse to Chief Lu Pei, who reported it to the headquarters for filing. The local guarantor was instructed to report to the court for a post-mortem examination. It is reported that the deceased had no family members in Shanghai, and his cousin, Dan Ke Deng, filed a claim to collect and bury the body. Also, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a man about 27 years old collapsed unconscious on the way at the intersection of Datong Road and Xinmin Road. The police from the Fourth District immediately transported the man to the Second Hospital of the Red Cross. He had already died by the time they arrived at the hospital entrance.</p>
<h3>Nine Winners of the Sixth Aviation Lottery Generously Donate to Support Construction in Ganzhou</h3>
<p>The sixth National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was drawn publicly at Yiyuan in Shanghai on June 29th. The grand prize number, 278487, was sold by Da Yun Company at No. 330, Sichuan Road, Shanghai, and distributed by Liu Hui Sheng Tang Pharmacy of Liu Yi Xiang on Pai Lou Main Street, Ganzhou, Jiangxi. The nine winners are all respected gentlemen from Ganzhou with substantial family wealth. Among them, Liu Ji Pu has already donated 30,000 yuan to the Ganzhou Red Cross Society for charitable purposes. The Ganzhou County Government stated that the county's city walls had been damaged by the Communist bandits, the scenic spots needed repair, and other local construction projects required significant funds. The winners are usually righteous and courageous, so they are even more willing to donate, contributing a total of over 200,000 yuan to complete local public welfare projects.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Manufacturers Must Use Chinese to Label Brands</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall received an order from the Social Affairs Bureau and a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, which forwarded a report from the Special Party Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office. The report stated that the Sixth Regiment Party Department requested a nationwide order to domestic goods companies and manufacturers to use Chinese to label domestic goods brands, except for those sold to foreign countries, to facilitate identification. Previously, the Executive Yuan had issued instructions to prohibit agencies and the public from misusing foreign languages, which had already been circulated. The Party Department's request to order domestic goods companies and manufacturers nationwide to use Chinese to label domestic goods brands for all products is consistent with the previous case and is feasible. (Remainder omitted). It is learned that the hall has sent a letter to the Shanghai Domestic Goods Factories Association to forward the order to the factories for compliance.</p>
<h3>Social Security Bureaus Strictly Prohibit False Names and Extortion of Donations from Boatmen</h3>
<p>Recently, unscrupulous individuals in the city have repeatedly been found to be extorting fees from boatmen in the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek, and Rihui Port areas under the guise of organizations. These organizations have not been approved and registered by the competent authorities and are illegally collecting fees, which is a violation of the law. The Social Affairs Bureau has severely cracked down on them, transferring them to the courts for investigation and prosecution. It is learned that the Bureau, to prevent similar incidents from recurring and to prevent ignorant boatmen from being deceived, has jointly issued a public notice with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Public Utility Bureau, and Finance Bureau. If there are any further incidents of illegally extorting donations under false pretenses, whether by individuals or organizations, they will be severely punished, and the collectors will be handed over to the police and transferred to the courts for legal action to enforce the prohibition.</p>
<h3>Tian Sheng Yu Falsely Claims to Be a Domestic Toothbrush; Mechanical Industries Association Revokes Certificate</h3>
<p>The Mechanical Industries Association sent a letter to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, we previously received a reply from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (omitted in the middle). Our association has repeatedly convened meetings of the toothbrush industry for discussion and sent representatives, including Mr. Fei Hui Ren from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu Liang from the toothbrush industry, to investigate the Shanghai distribution office of Tian Sheng Yu Factory. In addition to submitting the investigation situation and the doubts of the toothbrush industry regarding the products of Tian Sheng Yu Factory in a separate document, the domestic goods certificate No. 1 of the factory should be corrected by your association. Furthermore, our association is a domestic goods organization, and we have also issued domestic goods certificates to our member factories in the past. However, since these certificates are permanent and easily misused, we notified our members on December 5, 1932, to cancel them and declared them invalid in the newspaper. We prepared temporary certificates for members to use when transporting domestic goods, so as to avoid being misused for the sake of our association's reputation. We do not know if this can be adopted, and we ask for your consideration. Accordingly, we have enclosed a document outlining the eight doubts of the Shanghai toothbrush industry regarding the products of Tian Sheng Yu Factory and the situation of the investigation of the Shanghai distribution office of Tian Sheng Yu Factory, as well as a copy of the notice of cancellation of the previously issued domestic goods certificates. We send this letter for your attention and reply. At the same time, we have sent letters to various department stores to stop selling."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Recruits Four Doctors to Conduct Physical Examinations of Rickshaw Pullers</h3>

<h3>Gao Qiao Shi Abuses Adopted Daughter; Burns Face with Fire; Landlady Voices Outrage</h3>
<p>Gao Qiao Shi, a woman from Ningbo, 38 years old, lives at No. 21, You Zhi Nong Lane, outside the Small South Gate. In 1931, due to a lack of children, she purchased a girl in Wuxi and brought her home, naming her Jin Mei, and raising her to this day, now six years old. However, she is known for her shrewish nature, so Jin Mei is often whipped and even starved if she displeases her. Her neighbors also express outrage. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, Jin Mei accidentally angered her over a trivial matter, and Gao Qiao Shi actually placed a roll of newspaper on the ground, set it on fire, and then tied the girl's hands with hemp rope. She forcefully pressed the girl's head down, causing her face to be scorched by the fire. At that time, Jin Mei was unable to resist due to her young age and weakness. Her face was burned by the fire, blistering and festering, and bleeding profusely. The landlady, Hou Jiang Shi, heard the screams and rushed over. Unable to bear the sight, she secretly slipped out and summoned the watchman Shi Cheng Qi of the 19th station. Shi Cheng Qi arrested Gao Qiao Shi and took her and Jin Mei to the First Precinct, First Station. After questioning by Chief Yi, he found that the girl was covered in scars and wounds. He deemed Gao Qiao Shi's abuse of her adopted daughter inhumane and ordered a formal report to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation and punishment.</p>

<h3>Borrowing Money Unsuccessfully Leads to Violence; Disrupting Theater Order; Three People Detained and Legally Handled</h3>
<p>Tong Zhangquan, styled Rongzhang, from Shaoxing, aged forty-six, formerly served as an investigation officer in a certain county's Public Security Bureau's detective team. Later, due to improper conduct, he was dismissed from the team. However, Tong continued to use the team's name to swindle and extort money. On the night before last, around twelve o'clock, Tong was at the Fu'an Amusement Park at the intersection of Xiaodongmen and Dongmen Road in Nanshi when he suddenly encountered his brother, Yan Yongxiao. During their conversation, Tong asked Yan to borrow several tens of dollars to meet urgent needs. However, Yan refused because Tong had borrowed twenty dollars last year and had not yet returned it. Unexpectedly, Tong insisted on borrowing, which was overheard by Liu Shaoqi, the inspector of the amusement park. Because he knew Tong, Liu joined in the extortion. As a result, the two sides disagreed and clashed. The audience in the theater also shifted their gaze from the play and gathered to watch Yan's dispute.

<h3>One Year Since the Collision of the "Tunan"; The Japanese Verdict is Rebutted Again; The Japanese Demand Compensation; Our Side Rebuts Again and Lodges a Stern Protest</h3>
<p>It has been one year since the merchant ship "Tunan" was sunk by the Japanese ship "Changchun Maru" in the Shandong sea area last year. After the "Tunan" was sunk, our side advocated organizing an arbitration tribunal in Shanghai, but the Dalian Steamship Company refused and even sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau demanding more than 70,000 yuan for various losses of the "Changchun Maru." If not paid, they threatened to detain our ships. Upon receiving this news, the China Merchants Bureau investigated the total losses of the "Tunan," including the value of the sunken passengers and goods, and submitted a detailed list to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, formally requesting negotiations with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order the Dalian Steamship Company to promptly compensate for the losses. Four months later, the Dalian Steamship Company finally replied, stating that the case had been judged by the Dalian Kwantung Office Maritime Court, holding the Chinese ship responsible and stating that the "Changchun Maru" bore no responsibility. The judgment was made on September 12th of last year by Okamoto Makoto, Chairman of the Kwantung Office Ship Disciplinary Committee, as well as Committee Members Eara Mikiki, Kwan Sai Shiroya and others, for the owner of the "Changchun Maru," Kashiwagi Hachiro, stating that the "Changchun Maru" was sailing without error and would not be subject to disciplinary action. The judgment was based purely on the statements of Japanese crew members from the "Tongji Maru," "Toka Maru," and "Azuma Maru," as well as the second mate Konno and the second engineer Matsuyama of the "Changchun Maru." The reports of the crew members of our country's "Tunan" were completely ignored, resulting in a one-sided judgment that did not conform to the facts. It is reported that the China Merchants Bureau will carefully rebut the judgment document based on the facts and submit it to the central government again, requesting a stern protest to achieve the purpose of compensation, clarify right and wrong, and promote justice.</p>

<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3>Scientific Spiritualism and Ghosts and Gods丨Reply to Mr. Li Jiasheng丨</h3>
<p>[Scientific Spiritualism Chart] was popular for a month or two, but now this craze is gradually cooling down. Presumably, many people have been fooled and realized that it is a deceptive thing. However, its impact on the general public is still quite significant. Many people are still half-believing and half-doubting, such as Mr. Li Jiasheng and others who have written to inquire about this matter. He said that he had personally tested this spiritualism and that everything answered through this spiritualism regarding past events was accurate. He felt that this was truly [mysterious] and [profound], and it could not be understood without explaining it through ghosts and gods.</p>
<p>The principle of spiritualism has been discussed in various newspaper supplements and magazines before, and it seems that we do not need to spend much effort on it now. However, now that people are still asking about this matter, it can be known that many people are still hoping for an answer. At least, we still need to provide a more accessible and clearer explanation so that the general public can understand the true nature of this ghost and not be deceived by it.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the principle of spiritualism. Although spiritualism seems mysterious to the general public, it is a very ordinary and simple thing when explained by psychology. In a word: spiritualism is nothing more than a kind of [unconscious behavior]. Unconscious behavior is something that people do unconsciously. Many of our behaviors are unintentional and unconscious. This kind of unconscious behavior is mostly due to habit. For example, a person who closes the windows every day before going out will often unconsciously go to close the windows naturally after a long time. Also, when we walk on the road, we can just think about other things, but our feet can walk naturally, turning when encountering a turn, and avoiding when encountering an obstacle, unconsciously walking a long distance [without even realizing it]. When one is excessively concerned and attentive to a certain thing, unconscious behavior will also occur. For example, the phenomenon of sleepwalking, where one can get up in the middle of the night and do things that were not finished during the day, is because they were very concerned about this matter during the day. The secret of hypnosis lies in finding a way to make the subject use their own commands to cause the subject's unconscious actions. As for the principle of spiritualism, it also utilizes unconscious actions during concentrated attention. The movement of the saucer in the center of the spiritualism chart is not actually caused by ghosts touching it, but because the person holding the planchette's fingers have been suspended under the saucer for half an hour, and on the one hand, their arm has become sore and numb and naturally trembling, thus pushing the saucer. On the other hand, because their attention has been focused on the spiritualism chart, their own arm is pushing the saucer, but they do not know it, and instead think that the saucer is moving by itself. As for the subsequent summoning of ghosts and conversations, and inquiries about things, it is still the result of unconscious actions. Mr. Li said that everything asked about past events was accurate because everything in the past was already a foregone conclusion in the minds of Mr. Li and his peers, and the answers were all made by Mr. Li and his peers themselves, but Mr. Li and his peers were not aware of it. Moreover, spiritualism can only accurately tell us about past events. For future events, the answers of spiritualism are completely unreliable. A pregnant woman asked whether she would give birth to a boy or a girl, and the spiritualism answered that she would give birth to a boy, but in reality, she later gave birth to a girl. This is because the woman's hope for a boy was unintentionally expressed in the spiritualism, and it was definitely not a ghost deceiving her! In addition, such as buying aviation lottery tickets and flower clubs, some people have also asked about the numbers, but no one has ever succeeded! The deceptiveness of the spiritualism chart can be understood very clearly here.</p>
<p>Ghosts and gods do not exist. People with scientific common sense do not need to doubt this matter anymore. Feuerbach said, [God is created by man.] The Chinese proverb also says: [Suspicion breeds ghosts.] Ghosts and gods are tools used by a portion of the privileged class in society to deceive the public. When the public is deceived, they believe that their fate is controlled by ghosts and gods, and do not know that the root of their suffering lies in society, and cannot face and observe society. The public should no longer be fooled by blind faith, should no longer be content with the dictates of fate, and should observe their surroundings with a scientific eye to find their true way out.</p>
<p>In the current era of economic panic, most people are suffering from a lack of livelihood. The only way to solve the livelihood of the masses is to see this society clearly and deal with everything with a positive attitude. However, some people cannot recognize this point. They covet ease and seek luck, so aviation lottery tickets, flower clubs, etc., have become their best way to solve their livelihood. Indeed, one win is tens of thousands of yuan, how can it not be good? But what about reliability! It is simply like looking for a needle in a haystack, so many people are still suffering from a lack of certainty. The scientific spiritualism chart has seized on this point and has come forward in big strides, writing guarantees to people, saying that it can definitely know the winning numbers in advance. People eager to win, therefore, rush to buy spiritualism charts and rush to buy aviation tickets, but in the end, who has really won the prize? We have never seen it.</p>
<p>People who hope for luck are the most pitiful. They are deceived and trampled on without knowing it. If we want to avoid repeating the same mistakes, we must earnestly recognize the world and recognize society through scientific research. At the same time, we must see clearly that the so-called scientific spiritualism chart is just a superstitious tool that deceives people under the guise of science.</p>

<h3>Ideals and Will</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>Humans have various ideals, and then they have various new inventions and new constructions, so they can create today's bright and splendid world. If humans did not have ideals, where would there be any new inventions or new constructions?</p>
<p>Although we have very grand ideals, if we are not willing to do them practically, the result will only be empty dreams, fantasies, and reveries!</p>
<p>Children! Do you have ideals? Do you want your ideals to come true? If you want your ideals to come true, you should strengthen your will and move forward on the path of your ideals, then you can realize your ideals.</p>
<p>Children! Do you remember? In the country of Sparta, a young man said to his mother: [My sword:] [If the sword is too short, I can make it longer myself.] In fact, it doesn't seem strange, but from a young age, he cultivated the spirit of creation and a strong will, which is what we should know.</p>
<p>Dear children! If you have the spirit of creation and a strong will, how can your ideals not become a reality?</p>
<h3>Zeng Wenzheng Achieved Success by Practicing a New Life</h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Zeng Wenzheng's morality, meritorious deeds, calligraphy, and writing are all known to be very good. Inquiring into why he had such great achievements, it is indeed derived from practicing a new life.</p>
<p>When Zeng Wenzheng was young, he started reading at the age of five, and by the age of nine, he had finished reading the Five Classics thoroughly. At that time, there were no elementary school textbooks, but he was willing to follow the methods of teaching people mentioned in the Five Classics. He studied the Book of Zhou Rites and the Book of Rites at the age of fifteen, so he paid great attention to etiquette. It can be seen that he had already formed the habit of learning from the Five Classics in his childhood.</p>
<p>How can it be seen that he was practicing a new life! Isn't it like an association? There is evidence, called being true to one's name.</p>
<p>Zeng Wenzheng's name was Guofan. The two characters Guofan are taken from the meaning of [protecting the country and building a fence], which means that he was determined to do something for the country in the future. At the age of twenty-one, he changed his nickname to Disheng. He himself said: The character "di" means to wash away the pollution of the old dyeing, and the character "sheng" is taken from Yuan Liaofan of the Ming Dynasty, who said, [All the past, like yesterday's death, all the future, like today's birth.] We see that his explanation of the meaning of Disheng is exactly in line with the three characters of the current new life, but at that time, there was no new vocabulary for this new knowledge.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that people will make mistakes. If you realize that you are doing something wrong, you should immediately change it. It's like very dirty things, which can only be renewed by scrubbing hard: It's like coming back to life after death, no longer following the old path of death, and moving forward on the bright road: The so-called [correct them if you have them, and encourage yourself if you don't,] practicing a new life like this will naturally lead to the achievement of virtue and career.</p>
<p>Children, savor the two characters Disheng, reflect on your clothing, food, housing, and transportation at all times, set a good example, practice a new life, and prepare to be a barrier to the country and save the country from danger.</p>

<h3>How to Pay Attention to Summer Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Rizhao</p>
<p>Children, summer is the season when flies and mosquitoes are rampant. If we are not careful, we will get sick. Rather than taking that sour and bitter medicine after getting sick, it is better to be careful in advance. The following are the items that we must practice every day.</p>
<p>(1) Clothes: The best color for clothes is white, because white repels sunlight. And you should change your clothes at least once a day, and don't wear them when they are wet with sweat.</p>
<p>(2) Food: Don't eat too much oil, it is best to eat vegetarian food, but don't overeat. Do not eat overnight food. Do not eat cold drinks from street vendors. It is best to drink cold boiled water.</p>
<p>(3) Living: Windows should be opened often to allow air to circulate. Drains and other dirty places should be frequently sprayed with disinfectant. Do not sleep in the open at night.</p>
<p>(4) Bathing: In summer, take a bath at least once a day. It is advisable to wash with warm water, and after washing, you must wipe dry with a dry towel.</p>
<p>(5) Other: It is best to take a nap for a while in the afternoon, and take a walk in the evening. Wear a straw hat when going out, and do not go naked.</p>
<h3>Simple Balloon</h3>
<p>— Zijing</p>
<p>Haha! I often make this balloon to play with. The method is extremely easy, so it is named a simple balloon. Children, if you have time, you can make one in an open space to play with.</p>
<p>Supplies: Machine-made paper, bamboo sticks, thin iron wire, broken cotton, tung oil. Production method: Cut out several pieces of machine-made paper (Figure 1), which can be enlarged at will. After cutting, paste them with flour paste to prevent leaks (as in Figure 2). Use bamboo sticks to make a ring at the bottom (as in the size of the balloon opening), and glue it to the opening of the paper balloon: Then use iron wire to make a net (as in Figure 2), press it on the bamboo stick at the balloon opening: Then wrap broken cotton with tung oil, light it in the net, and hold it upright by two people. If it is slightly off, it will easily burn. After a while, the inside of the balloon is filled with black gas, and when you let go, it will gradually rise.</p>

<p>— Jingyuan</p>
<p>Wang Er's father bought him many toys to test him. Haha! It's almost ready.</p>
<p>Oh! Where's my pipe?</p>
<h3>Methods of Protecting Brainpower</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Children: Your brainpower must be very clever, but some children may not be as good as you. Then clever children must always protect their cleverness well. I will tell you the methods of protecting brainpower to avoid the decline of brainpower.</p>
<p>Don't be angry often, because after getting angry, blood flowing into the brain is easy to damage the brain. It is best to always be peaceful.</p>
<p>You must wear a hat or umbrella when going out, because direct sunlight on the brain is also easy to damage the brain: Alcohol is even more likely to damage the brain, so you should never drink or smoke it in your life.</p>
<p>The above are all good ways to protect the brain. Children: You are still young now, and your brainpower is at its most sensitive period. Then often use these protection methods. When you reach adulthood, you will definitely have a scientific mind, and you can invent all kinds of beneficial tools to defeat the great enemy of China.</p>
<h3>Why Can Fish Float and Swim</h3>
<p>— Tiansheweng</p>
<p>Crucian carp, carp, perch, etc. swim back and forth in the water, swimming up and down, lively and free, very happy. For example, our little brothers, little sisters, children, parade in the park in teams. They are all breathing free air and enjoying free happiness. People and fish are generally happy.</p>
<p>But, I think: people's walking and running rely on two feet. What about fish: the caudal fin is the rudder, and the pectoral and pelvic fins are the oars: the oars are used for forward movement: the rudder is used to turn the direction: the principles of fish and boats being able to move in water are indeed the same. People in ancient times invented ships after seeing fish swimming. Modern airplanes were invented after seeing birds. Children! What else can we invent?</p>
<p>Fins are fish's traveling companions. Why can fish float and sink in water, sometimes up and sometimes down? Sometimes, the head floats on the surface of the water, and the tail sinks in the water. Sometimes, the tail floats on the surface of the water, and the head rushes to the bottom of the water. Floating up and down is extremely convenient. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Let's try to cut open the belly of a fish. In addition to the intestines and stomach, isn't there also a silvery-white cyst? This thing is called a "swim bladder," which is the fish's tool for floating up and down. The swim bladder is divided into two parts, front and back. Each part is a leathery, long, oval sphere, which stores air. When floating, the air in the swim bladder is full. The fish then floats to the center of the water. When the air is released from the swim bladder, the fish then sinks into the water. If you want the head to be up and the tail to be down, then the front part of the swim bladder is full of air, and the rear part is released. If you want the head to be down and the tail to be up, then the rear part of the swim bladder is full of air, and the front part is released. In this way, fish can lively and freely float up and down.</p>
<p>Even if we carry a large leather bag full of air, we won't sink to the bottom of the water, even if someone can't swim. It's the same principle.</p>
<p>Small Experience</p>
<h3>Mildew and Moth Prevention</h3>
<p>— Jianfen</p>
<p>Children: During the rainy season, I think your homes have a little bit of stored books: you'd better move the stored books out on a sunny day and put them in the sun to dry.</p>
<p>After drying, add a little [broken camphor] (sold in pharmacies) and夹it in the books. In this way: the stored books will not mold or moth in the mildew. The reason is: mold must grow in damp places, and mold cannot live in dry places: when you dry the books, the sunlight has already evaporated the moisture in the books, and the books are very dry: then you put in camphor, camphor can kill蛀bugs: so mold and蛀bugs cannot invade your books, so your books will be completely worry-free. However, you cannot rely on this once and for all. Because over time, dry objects will become damp due to the air climate: and camphor will also lose its effectiveness over a long period of time. So you must also check it often and pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(PS) Children: If your books have been found to be moldy or蛀by bugs: you can quickly do it according to the above method, don't hold on to a passive doctrine. Because [it's better to mend the fold after the sheep is lost] than [to lose it again and again].</p>
<h3>Methods of Planting Flowers and Trees</h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>Dear children! Do you like trees, flowers, and plants? If you like them, you might as well plant some more in your schoolyard or in the gaps in your home. When the trees grow up and the flowers bloom, things that you plant and grow yourself will make you extremely happy once you get results.</p>
<p>Some plants are grown from seeds, which is convenient, and I don't need to say much about it here. Some plants are propagated by cuttings of branches, which is not an easy task. I now have some small experiences to contribute to you. This is what I have verified, you might as well try it.</p>
<p>Cut off the branches of various trees in winter, excluding those that are too tender or too old, and plant them upside down in sandy soil mixed with fine soil: they should be exposed to sunlight, and it is best not to be pressed by frost and snow. When the vernal equinox arrives, plant the upside-down branches upright in the soil, and they will sprout and grow leaves.</p>
<p>It is best to divide and transplant roses and the like before the vernal equinox. Cut off the branches that are not too tender or too old, insert them into the whole sugarcane, and plant them in the soil together, watering them often, and they will not easily die.</p>
<p>When breaking off gardenia, do not simply插it in the soil. Insert it in a vase for供養, as long as the water in the vase does not dry up, it will naturally grow whiskers, and it will be easy to grow after being buried in the soil after the flowers wither.</p>
<h3>Small Jokes</h3>
<p>— Ku Xuesheng</p>
<p>(1) One Hundred Points</p>
<p>After dinner, I was walking in the playground with classmate Zhiming. He reported the results of today's monthly exam. He said: [I got one hundred points on today's exam.] People listened to his words, and then very happily asked him: [Which subject is it?] He quickly replied to me: [Common knowledge is fifty points, and Chinese is fifty points. Isn't it exactly one hundred points when added together]?</p>
<p>(2) Who is the most honest person in the world?</p>
<p>Brother asks: [Brother! Do you know who is the most honest person in the world?</p>
<p>Brother answers: [Brother! The person who sells stinky tofu on the street is the most honest.</p>
<p>Brother further asked: [How do you know he is the most honest person?]</p>
<p>Brother also answers: [Because his tofu is stinky, when he sells it, isn't he loudly shouting stinky tofu? This is irrefutable evidence of not cheating people, so I praise him as the most honest person in the world]!</p>
<h3>Correspondence from Rural Little Friends</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>The sun is blushing and walking down obliquely: At this time, there are three or two spiders at the corners of the eaves, pulling silk from their bellies, using their flexible eight legs, making a few circles, and a bagua-shaped net is張good, it stands in the middle with great prestige: like the commander of the Bagua Formation.</p>
<p>However, although the spider is an insect, it has great perseverance. If, when making a net, it encounters a howling wind. The delicate silk cannot withstand the wind and breaks. The spider ignores it: it only believes that [hard work] can overcome everything: so it breaks and does it again, breaks and does it again: finally, it still wins with hard work, and still张the Bagua net, and becomes the commander itself. However, when a heavy rain comes, it is always被打落花流水, and there is no place to stand. However, after the dark snow is pushed away, it is again</p>
<p>Operating and destroying the fortress of flying insects.</p>
<p>Why do spiders work so hard? Friends! They and we humans are also in [competition for survival]! They put down the Bagua Formation, and I don't know how many small insects that fly freely in the sky are happily trapped in the net and become the food of the commander.</p>
<p>It is right to kill many pests: but it still kills beneficial insects such as dragonflies as usual, knowing only that it is food for the belly, so the friendly and peaceful Chinese cannot be blamed for being bullied by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Birds and Fish in a Wooden Box</h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>An empty wooden box weighs five pounds when suspended. If there are birds flying around inside, will the pointer still point to five pounds? Suppose this wooden box is filled with water and weighs fifteen pounds, and then a fish is put in, the water is still full, and the fish is swimming in the water, will the weight increase?</p>
<p>Children, you can understand by looking at the picture on the left. Although the bird does not stop in the box, when it flies, its two wings flap down, and the air pressure increases, so the weight on the scales also increases and does not stop at five pounds. Fish are a little different in water. Archimedes' theorem in physics tells us: [Water has buoyancy, and the weight of things in water is exactly equal to the weight of water displaced]. So the fish's wooden box is still fifteen pounds!</p>

<h3>Education News: Ministry of Education's Instructions on Key Points for Improvement in Schools Above the Specialty Level in Beiping (2)</h3>
<p>National Beiping Normal University</p>
<p>The school's operation is still lacking in good results. The following are the points that should be improved:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of the school's equipment, the library and auditorium are not suitable for use, there are very few complete sets of scientific journals, and the contents of the chemistry department's medicine and instrument room are not yet sufficient. It has been found that the school has as many as 172 staff members and 228 school servants and guards, which is too many. They should be reduced as much as possible, and administrative expenses should be saved for the purpose of enriching equipment.</p>
<p>(2) The school has 135 teachers, only 37 of whom are full-time, and many of the full-time teachers are still employed part-time outside the school. The school's important staff members also hold positions such as president and department head in other schools, which is inappropriate and should be corrected. Full-time teachers should be hired as much as possible, and strict measures should be formulated to restrict part-time teaching outside the school. Presidents, department heads, and other important responsible personnel should absolutely not hold part-time positions outside the school. Those who hold teaching positions concurrently within the school should not receive concurrent salaries.</p>
<p>(3) The school's research institute has only 12 students, but 48 staff members, and spends 3,800 yuan per month. There is no special equipment, and there are no achievements to speak of since its establishment. The research institute should be suspended from the next academic year, and the original funds should be transferred to enrich the equipment of the undergraduate program.</p>
<p>(4) The school's purpose is to cultivate teachers for secondary schools. The cultivation of students' character is especially important compared to other schools. In the future, the school should pay special attention to moral education.</p>
<h3>Private Yenching University</h3>
<p>Most of the school's teachers are full-time and able to work hard in research. The staff is also conscientious in their work. The allocation of funds is appropriate, and the equipment is adequate. The school provides housing for teachers and staff, giving teachers and students more opportunities to interact. All these achievements are commendable. However, the following points still need attention and improvement:</p>
<p>(1) The school originally had three colleges, eighteen departments, and two specialized courses, as well as a graduate school divided into twelve disciplines, which is too large. The school's current financial resources are difficult, and it should seek to shrink in the following two points to remedy the situation: 1. The colleges and departments should consider merging themselves and submit them to the Ministry for approval. 2. The graduate school should reduce the scope and follow the Ministry's promulgated Provisional Organizational Regulations for University Graduate Schools and submit them for approval.</p>
<p>(2) The school's administration and printed regulations are mostly issued in English, which is inappropriate. In the future, they should be changed to Chinese.</p>
<p>(3) The school's students' lives are mostly extravagant and should be corrected to cultivate a spirit of thrift.</p>
<p>(4) The school's sources of funding have recently been decreasing due to the impact of the world economy, which is a significant shortfall. A determined fund should be raised immediately to consolidate the school's economic foundation.</p>
<h3>Private Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping</h3>
<p>Since recent years, the school has been working hard to build new school buildings, add equipment, and determine funding. However, the following points should be followed and improved immediately:</p>
<p>(1) The school originally had three colleges, eleven departments, and preparatory courses, which is too many. They should consider merging themselves and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The pre-medical course was ordered to be canceled by the Ministry of Education a long time ago and should be discontinued immediately, and the students of the course should be merged into the departments of the College of Science.</p>
<p>(2) The school's graduate school should reduce its scope and follow the Provisional Organizational Regulations for University Graduate Schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education three years ago and submit them to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>In addition to the organization and description, other departments are all missing. A detailed curriculum outline and content description for each department should be properly formulated and implemented.</p>
<p>(4) The school's teachers mostly hold concurrent positions, and those who are called full-time teachers actually hold part-time teaching positions outside the school, which is inappropriate. Full-time teachers should be hired as much as possible, and part-time teaching outside the school should be restricted.</p>
<h3>Private China College</h3>
<p>The summarized report states that many aspects of its operation are not in compliance. This college receives a substantial amount of public funding each year, yet there is no demonstrated achievement. This greatly betrays the government's intention in subsidizing private schools. The following is an excerpt of the key points of the report, and it is expected that they will be strictly followed and implemented for improvement:</p>
<p>(1) There are too few science books in the science department, and newly published ones are especially rare. There are only two or three magazines, and they are insignificant. The content of the biology department is somewhat outdated. The equipment is only sufficient for teaching experiments in the lower grades. Advanced physics laboratories are completely lacking. The chemistry instrument and reagent room is very rudimentary. The library and practical equipment of other departments are also makeshift and insufficient for application. The college shall, starting from the next academic year, designate two-thirds of the annual government subsidy, amounting to 80,000 yuan, specifically for the purchase of instruments and books, and report the details of the equipment purchased each semester for review. In addition, the college should raise its own substantial funding to make up for the deficiencies.</p>
<p>(2) Many faculty and staff members hold multiple positions, and even those who are supposed to be full-time often hold other positions elsewhere. The key responsible personnel cannot be on campus daily. Moreover, most of the science faculty members lack the academic qualifications and experience to adequately fulfill their roles. In the future, all staff members, especially key responsible personnel, should be changed to full-time positions. Instructors should be replaced as much as possible with personnel who can reliably and competently fulfill their responsibilities, with full-time employment as the guiding principle.</p>
<p>(3) Students live off-campus, which has a negative impact on moral education and academic atmosphere. It is imperative to add dormitories and require all students to live on campus to improve discipline and promote academic research. In addition, existing students should receive rigorous training, and new students should be rigorously admitted to raise the academic level. (4) This Ministry previously ordered that the physics and chemistry departments of the college be divided into two departments. However, according to the report, the professors and equipment of each department make it difficult to operate as two departments. The scope should be reduced immediately, and the college should consider temporarily establishing one department (either physics or chemistry) and submit a plan to the Ministry for approval. As for the Department of Law, the Economics and Commerce departments should be merged starting from the next academic year.</p>
<h3>Private Chaoyang College</h3>
<p>The points that the college should improve are presented as follows:</p>
<p>Although the college's buildings are spacious, some classrooms are rectangular in shape, which hinders students' viewing and listening. The location of the library is also unsuitable and needs to be improved urgently. Most of the books in the library are outdated, and Western books are especially rare. An amount should be designated from the college's foundation for the purchase of books.</p>
<p>The college's regular income relies heavily on student fees, which is not a sustainable plan. It is imperative to find other reliable sources of income to ensure stability.</p>
<p>In the past, the college's admissions were not strict, and the number of students was excessive, while the equipment was insufficient. In the future, efforts should be made to reduce enrollment and strictly comply with the Ministry's recent regulations on admissions. The specialized department should be closed in accordance with previous orders.</p>
<p>Many of the college's faculty and staff hold multiple positions, and even those who are supposed to be full-time still hold other positions elsewhere. In the future, instructors should be replaced with personnel who can reliably and competently fulfill their responsibilities, with full-time employment as the guiding principle.</p>
<p>The college lacks statistics on teacher absences, student absences, student withdrawals, and leaves of absence. More than a month after the semester began, students could still register at any time without any restrictions. Entrance examination papers have been completely discarded. Most students live off-campus, and management is lax, which shows a lack of seriousness in both teaching and moral education. All of these issues should be strictly rectified.</p>
<p>In addition, the curriculum of the college's law department relies heavily on lecture notes, which is considered too shallow. In the future, efforts should be made to improve students' ability to read Chinese and Western reference books and cultivate students' spirit of independent research.</p>

<p>In the past year, the college has made considerable efforts to improve various aspects. The following key points are presented to order serious improvement:</p>
<p>Most of the college's faculty members are part-time, and their salaries are low. Although the equipment has been slightly increased, it is still insufficient for teaching and reference. All efforts should be made to hire full-time professors, increase their salaries, and enrich various facilities.</p>
<p>The college's fundraising plan is indeed a fundamental solution to improve various undertakings. However, of the 500,000 yuan of funds to be raised, in addition to the 150,000 yuan already stored, the remaining amount should continue to be raised according to the original plan. In addition, raising student levels and enriching the content of academic disciplines are also the college's urgent priorities. Matters such as strict admission of new students, rigorous training of existing students, strict examinations, elimination of unnecessary subjects, and strict scheduling of curriculum should be implemented strenuously.</p>
<h3>Private Peiping Union Medical College</h3>
<p>The college has excellent facilities and equipment, rich content, and highly qualified faculty and staff members who are all full-time and dedicated to research. The establishment of scholarships, loan programs, and student service departments greatly benefits diligent and excellent students. This is highly commendable. However, the college should improve the following points to maximize its effectiveness:</p>
<p>(1) Given the college's excellent facilities and faculty, the college should consider adding classes as recommended in the report, or making other appropriate arrangements, to enroll more students and broaden the scope of education.</p>
<p>(2) The college's enrollment of new students is limited to students from a small number of public and private universities, which is considered too narrow. Efforts should be made to expand the scope in the future. Furthermore, St. John's University, which is recognized by the college, has not been approved by the Ministry, and students from that school should not be admitted to the college. (3) The college's teaching is excessively focused on English and should be gradually corrected appropriately. In administrative matters, the language used should be primarily Chinese.</p>
<p>(4) The college should strive to cultivate a simple and pragmatic style so that students can better adapt to serving society after graduation.</p>
<h3>Private Railway College</h3>
<p>Since the college was approved by the Ministry, it has paid attention to implementing the improvement guidelines. However, the college's curriculum lacks standards and should be detailed and strictly implemented. New and important books and magazines should also be purchased as appropriate. The number of part-time faculty members should be reduced and more full-time faculty members should be hired, and their salaries should be increased. Key staff members should be prohibited from holding positions outside the college. Furthermore, the academic level of the college's students is low. In the future, the admission of new students should be strict, and current students should receive diligent training. (End)</p>
<h3>Graduation Qualifications for Students Taking the Joint Examination in This City</h3>
<p>Verified and approved after checking academic records.</p>
<p>Those whose academic records do not match shall be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>The joint graduation examination for middle schools in this city was held for three days starting on June 25th. The examination papers for each subject have been graded separately. All joint examination results will be announced today. However, the graduation qualifications of students participating in this year's joint examination whose academic records have not been verified will be determined after the transfer documents have been verified. The Municipal Bureau of Education issued a special announcement yesterday stating that since the Bureau changed the method of verifying academic records, the academic records of all students from other schools who transfer to schools in this city are verified by the school in this city sending the documents directly to the competent educational administrative organ in the location of the student's original school, and then the verifying organ directly replies to this Bureau to verify whether their academic qualifications match in order to determine whether to approve or reject. Many of the students from middle schools in this city who participated in this year's joint graduation examination have not yet had their responses from the competent educational administrative organs in the location of the original school sent to the Bureau. In addition to allowing them to participate in the joint examination first, the graduation qualifications of these students will still be determined after the academic records have been verified and sent to the Bureau. Those whose academic records are found to be inconsistent or who have forged documents shall be dealt with according to law. This is hereby announced for public knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, in this year's graduation examination, 951 students from 50 schools who passed all subjects are approved for graduation, and 1,612 students from 72 junior high schools who passed all subjects are approved for graduation.</p>

<h3>Chiang's Written Training Speech</h3>
<p>It is common knowledge that education is the fundamental undertaking for national salvation. Among various types of education, vocational education is most in line with today's needs and is especially recognized by the gentlemen of your society. Your society has been promoting vocational education for many years with the power of the masses, and the achievements are indeed considerable, which is worthy of our admiration. However, there is one thing that the gentlemen must pay attention to, that is, from a superficial observation, most people in our country are suffering from unemployment, while a small number of employed people lack the skills to meet the requirements of their jobs. Therefore, only by developing vocational education can we reduce the past education system's drawback of producing high-level idlers, and enable those who have jobs to be competent and those who have careers to enjoy their work. However, if we make a more in-depth observation, we will know that the people of the country do not suffer from lack of jobs, but from lack of responsibility to be loyal to their jobs, and do not suffer from lack of skills to meet the requirements of their jobs, but from lack of ambition to seek progress. To remedy this shortcoming, it seems that the promotion of vocational education alone cannot be successful. In recent months, Zhongzheng launched the New Life Movement, and its purpose is also to be here. I deeply hope that the gentlemen understand this point, and must infuse the spirit of the New Life Movement into vocational education. In other words, the people must understand etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and then vocational education can be fully effective. Now that your society is gathering in Nanchang, I will specially offer a few words as a contribution. Chiang Kai-shek, July 13th</p>

<h3>Zhang Shouyong and Qiu Hanping Establish China Maritime Vocational School</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Press Conference on School's Mission and Policies</p>
<p>The private China Maritime Vocational School, located at 233 Metcalfe Road in this city, was founded by Zhang Shouyong, Qiu Hanping, and others, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, at Zhang's residence in the India Curry Restaurant on Sima Road, a reception was held for reporters from various newspapers to report on the school's mission and their own policies for running the school. Zhang began by stating that in recent years, economic panic has caused a slump in all industries, and that internal and external troubles are pressing in on all sides. The people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. After graduation, young students find it difficult to find employment, which may lead to shortsightedness or dangerous paths. Farmers and workers are abandoning their villages and entering the cities. If this continues, it will not be a long-term solution. To save the current crisis, the whole country is urgently focused on rural revitalization. However, rural revitalization cannot be achieved by empty talk. It must be deeply rooted in the countryside. Therefore, training talent is the most urgent task. When engaging in rural construction, we should first pay attention to the relationship between cities and rural areas. Today, China's finances are concentrated in the cities, while the countryside is extremely poor. The best way to channel funds from cities into rural areas is to promote credit cooperatives. Credit cooperatives in cities can meet the urgent needs of wage earners and channel surplus funds from cities into rural areas. England, France, Germany, Denmark, and other countries have been doing this for years with remarkable results, which we can learn from. This is the first goal of establishing this school. Young students are often at a loss after graduation, and school authorities only consider their responsibility fulfilled by issuing graduation certificates. The graduates' future paths and social guidance are completely ignored. Such education can only be called the responsibility of "teaching," and the word "education" is not fully realized. This is acceptable in ordinary schools, but not in vocational education. Not only are parents greatly disappointed, but young students will also have short-sighted ideas. Therefore, vocational education must fully realize the two characters of education, especially since teaching must include nurturing. With this in mind, the school strives to enrich students' knowledge during their studies so that they can take on work in the future. After graduation, it helps them find employment. If they cannot find employment, the school will be responsible for their living expenses. This graduation employment plan has been thoroughly researched by Mr. Qiu Hanping, who has concrete plans, and the school is confident that it can be achieved. In this way, vocational school graduates will not become an unemployed mass, which aligns with the true meaning of vocational education. This is the second goal of establishing this school. What is learned is not what is used, and what is used is not what is learned. This is a common problem in China today. The courses offered by schools are often ambitious and impractical. Young students spend a long time idling and developing bad habits at school. Therefore, even if they have a job after graduation, it is difficult for them to be competent. I firmly believe that young people with both good character and academic performance who are hardworking and able to endure hardship will not have to worry about unemployment. We should also pay attention to students' character and practical knowledge when providing education. The establishment of this school is intended to enable young people to seek practical knowledge and skills, as well as physical and mental training, for the benefit of themselves and others in the future. This is the third goal of establishing this school. However, the school is still in its initial stage, with a small scale, and needs the support and guidance of everyone, and so on. Finally, Principal Qiu Hanping described the process of establishing the school and the future direction. It is reported that dozens of applications are received daily from outside the city, and the school will hold its first entrance examination on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<h3>Chinese Culture Society Shanghai Branch Holds Public Education</h3>
<p>Implementation Begins in Caojiadu</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Culture Society has been working with extraordinary intensity. In addition to publishing various magazines and series to engage in academic movements, it has also begun to promote public education. Through the efforts of committee members Liu Bingli, Xiao Zuolin, Ni Wenya, Chen Gaimin, and Xu Jin, and with the support of Mayor Wu Tiecheng, a public school has been officially established in Caojiadu. The school focuses on three goals: teaching illiterate people the basic characters used in daily life, teaching illiterate people simple living knowledge and skills, and enabling illiterate people to recognize the importance of national, state, and group life. A thousand-character textbook has been compiled for students to study. To meet the needs of workers, classes are divided into day and night shifts. Students who study at the school for two hours can also receive rice coupons worth five cents. Therefore, the number of students enrolled has reached over a thousand, and latecomers have a sense of regret. It is learned that the school held its opening ceremony at the Caojiadu Zhongyi Association on the evening of the 11th. Over a thousand guests attended, including Xu Jin, Chairman, Liu Bingli, Xiao Zuolin, Ni Wenya, Directors of the Cultural Society, Ruan Jue, Director of the China Industrial and Commercial Rubber Factory, Zhang Zhedian, and other guests who delivered speeches in succession, followed by the screening of movies produced by the Star and Tianyi Film Companies.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Girls' School Benefits Young Women</h3>
<p>Recruits 120 Free Students</p>
<p>Since Ji Da took over as principal of the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road in this city, she has strictly reorganized the school in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education and the established plan, with remarkable results. It is reported that the school, in view of the bankruptcy of the domestic rural economy and the depression of urban commerce, the problem of young people's access to education will inevitably be affected, in order to remedy and promote female education, this year's enrollment, a specific number of 120 free places for boarding students in junior high school, senior high school, normal school, and physical education normal school, to cultivate a wide range of talents, the method is: (1) Students from poor families with lofty aspirations will be sent by local education administrative organs with letters of recommendation, and those who pass the entrance examination will enjoy the preferential treatment of tuition and accommodation fee waivers; (2) Students from families with acceptable financial situations and excellent grades will be certified by local education administrative organs with letters of recommendation, and those who pass the entrance examination will enjoy the preferential treatment of tuition fee waivers.

<h3>Chengdong Girls' Middle School Approved for Registration</h3>
<p>Since Ms. Shen Yijun, a Bachelor of Education from Daxia University, took over as the Director of Academic Affairs at the private Chengdong Girls' Elementary and Middle School on Huayi Street in the city, assisting Ms. Fang Yingda, a Bachelor of Education from Daxia University and a researcher from Yenching University, who is the principal, they have worked hard to reorganize the school, sparing no effort. The school's affairs are flourishing and the number of students has increased sharply. The elementary school has already been approved for registration by the Municipal Education Bureau. The middle school department of the school has also recently been inspected by the bureau, and because the school has been managed with considerable success, it has been approved for registration. Currently, during the summer vacation, Ms. Fang and Ms. Shen are still actively planning improvements and expansions. It is reported that there are many new students enrolling in the school. There are still a small number of vacancies in the first, second, and third grades of junior high school. The school can accommodate more than sixty boarders. The facilities and management are quite complete, so there is a great deal of enthusiasm among those who apply for the examination.</p>
<h3>Chunjiang Elementary School Opens Summer Tutoring Classes</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, Chunjiang Elementary School on Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road in this city has seen its school affairs flourish and its student body grow large due to the principal Mr. Shan Xuan's conscientious management of all facilities in the school. The school's spring semester has already ended. In order to allow students to make use of the summer vacation to supplement their studies, summer tutoring classes have been specially opened, and classes began on the 5th of this month and will end around August 25th. Students who achieve excellent results in the summer classes will be exempted from the entrance examination for the school's autumn semester. From the autumn semester onwards, two experienced teachers will be added. It is also reported that the school is in the process of hiring famous Shanghai figures as school board members and carrying out registration procedures.</p>

<h3>Zhang Dingzhao Wins China Sports Association Singles Tennis Championship</h3>
<p>Straight Sets Victory Over Luo Min'e</p>
<p>Doubles Final This Afternoon</p>
<p>The China Sports Association's Open Tennis Championship concluded yesterday with the final. Zhang and Luo arrived at the court on time, looking impressive. Both sides were on guard, and the battle for the championship began at 5:00 PM. Although Luo Min'e's strategy was exquisite, he was ultimately no match for Zhang Dingzhao due to his short legs. Zhang won the championship by winning two sets in a row with scores of 6-2, 6-2, and 6-1.</p>
<p>The final will be played today at 5:00 PM, with Lin Baohua and Sun Linfang facing Zhu Miao and Zhuo Guanpei. It is difficult to predict who will win. Judging by appearances, the Lin-Sun team seems to have a better chance. If the Zhu-Zhuo team can cooperate well, winning the championship is also a possibility. The strength of the Zhu-Zhuo team is not much different from that of the Lin-Sun team. Today at 5:00 PM, there will be another fierce battle, which is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Tilden Suddenly Suspended</h3>

Before the suspension is lifted, how can Tilden participate in matches? Each time he does, he will be fined $100.</p>

<p>A Brief Biography of Sun Duoqi Mr. Sun Duoqi was a native of Shouchun, Anhui. He worked at the Shanghai Postal Administration. In 1920, indignant about China's disastrous defeat at the Far Eastern Games, he organized the Baihong Track and Field Team with Chen Xuzhou, Chen Baoqiu, Wang Jianwu, and others. Mr. Sun was elected as the Secretary-General and worked diligently, sparing no effort for five years. Baihong was able to develop thanks to him. Recently, he planned for Baihong to go north to participate in the Suzhou Triangle Competition. Unfortunately, he fell ill and passed away suddenly. When Baihong went to Suzhou to participate in the Triangle Competition, they were shocked to hear the sad news. The entire army wept and wore black gauze on their arms to express their condolences. The depth of their feelings was such.</p>

<h3>J. PARMLY PARET Original Work, Joint Translation by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun, All Rights Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited</h3>
<p>Not only must the heels not touch the ground, but the knees must also be slightly bent, so that the movements can be flexible and free. A player who can quickly respond to the overall situation on the court has already achieved half of their success. Because in order to meet balls coming from any direction and be prepared to reach them in time, the entire body weight must always be kept in a downward-sitting posture.</p>
<p>Regarding the above three basic rules—that is, both feet are parallel to the flight path of the ball, the heels do not touch the ground, and the knees are slightly bent—after understanding them, now let's go back to study the relationship between the position of the feet and the net, the position the body should take for the flight path of the ball and good shots. To move quickly, you must use the foot farthest in the direction you want to move to push off. Therefore, when both feet are parallel to the net, moving left and right becomes very fast, because one foot or the other is always in a relative position, and when quick action is needed, one of the feet can naturally serve as a support. However, in reality, there are many times when the feet need to move forward, backward, or diagonally. At this time, if both feet are standing flat, you lose support and cannot move quickly. To move forward or backward, one foot must be quickly moved in front of or behind the other foot, and then the body can actually move forward or backward. From this, it can be seen that before hitting the ball, the most appropriate position is for both feet to be at an angle to the net. For forehand or backhand shots, the feet must move very quickly, so standing with both feet flat is impossible. Experienced players do not need to run to meet balls that can be reached; they always wait for the ball to fly close to their body and simply step their feet quickly into the appropriate position to respond freely. Because both feet are standing diagonally, there is absolutely no restriction on moving forward, backward, left, or right, and no time is wasted, and the movement of the feet is very fast, which is a very important point.</p>
<p>If the ball comes to the right side, then of course a forehand shot should be used. If the ball's bounce is strong at this time, move the right foot behind the left foot; if the ball's bounce is weak, move the left foot forward. Conversely, if the ball comes to the left side, then of course a backhand shot should be used. If the right foot is moved forward to meet a short bounce, then the left foot is moved backward to meet a long bounce. When shooting forward, the body should rotate from the hips, and the head of the racket should meet the incoming ball to increase the force of the impact. When the racket swings backward, the entire body weight is concentrated on the right foot and leg, and then the leg moves forward to shoot, shifting the weight to the left foot (this is in regards to a forehand shot; for a backhand shot, the two feet are reversed). The racket should still reach the end point, but the player's body must still maintain balance.</p>
<p>The player's eyes, of course, absolutely must be focused on the ball. "Keep your eyes on the ball" is the slogan for success in tennis. From the beginning of the game until the end, the eyes must not leave the ball. The slightest inattention will inevitably lead to mistakes. Therefore, when hitting the ball, to ensure both the speed and direction are effective, the eyes must be focused on the ball. This is a basic rule that beginners must not neglect.</p>
<p>This foot movement to respond to incoming balls must be extremely fast and convenient. Therefore, when waiting for an incoming ball, having both feet angled towards the net is much more convenient and flexible for foot movement than having both feet standing flat towards the net. When hitting the ball, slightly squatting the body forward has significant benefits. Body weight must follow the racket forward to increase the power of the shot. When the racket swings forward, straightening the body from the slightly squatting position can strengthen the power of the shot. With the body slightly squatting forward, the knees are naturally slightly bent, so when the racket hits, the body straightens up, and the force of the body weight, in this situation, must follow the racket out, thus increasing the racket's momentum and the power of the shot.</p>
<p>When both feet are standing in the appropriate position, the hips should be slightly turned to the side, like playing golf. During the shot, the hips naturally follow the racket and turn to the front. Thus, the combined power of the bent legs, the shifting hips, and the body weight leaning, plus the power of the arm from the shoulder to the wrist on the racket, becomes a huge concentrated force. All experienced players are good at using this concentrated force to direct the ball to the opponent's area.</p>
<p>The "follow-through" used in playing golf is also an important element of tennis technique. Because after the ball is hit away from the racket, the power of the whole body must still follow the momentum forward and not stop immediately. Beginners often think that as long as the ball leaves the racket, it's over and they can stop exerting force, which is very dangerous. You need to know that although the propulsive force cannot affect the ball's flight after it leaves the racket, if there is a tendency to stop pushing forward as soon as the racket is swung out before or during the shot, it will affect the power of the shot itself and cause changes, and will also indirectly affect the ball's flight.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Martyr Qiu Jin</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Reading the report from Anqing City in this newspaper on the 6th of this month, I learned that Anhui Province held the 27th anniversary commemoration of Xu Xilin's martyrdom at the Provincial Party Headquarters on that day, and the provincial government stipulated that July 6th every year would be Anqing Memorial Day. This news of honoring the martyrs couldn't help but comfort Martyr Xu in the afterlife, but at the same time, it grieved me for another martyr.</p>
<p>Who is the other martyr? Needless to say, it is Qiu Jin.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu and Martyr Xu had the same ideals, the same plans, the same actions, and the same relationship in their martyrdom. However, one is mourned by ten thousand people, while the other only has tangled weeds scattered around the door. How can this contrast not make people regretful?</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu's life deeds are clearly visible to everyone. Her lonely tomb can make the mountains and lakes magnificent, but now the wind and rain pavilion next to the tomb has been destroyed by wind and rain, only making passersby feel a sense of desolation. I remember the statue of Mr. Chen Qimei, a martyr of Zhejiang Province, standing majestically in Hangzhou's Hubin Park, and the memorial day of Mr. Zhu Zhixin, with memorial ceremonies held by all agencies in the province. The martyrs sacrificed themselves for the country and did not count the posthumous honors. However, from the perspective of respecting the spirit of the martyrs, I really feel that people like Ms. Qiu</p>
<p>deserve to be given a memorial day like other martyrs, to receive people's admiration and love.</p>
<p>The day this issue of our publication is published is exactly the anniversary of Ms. Qiu's martyrdom (two days before June 6th of the lunar calendar). We have specially prepared a few short articles to express a small token of remembrance and to encourage our female compatriots to know the way to aspire.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Commemorating the Female Knight Qiu Jin</h3>
<p>— Ji Qun</p>
<p>Today, twenty-seven years ago, was the day the Female Knight Qiu Jin of Jianhu was arrested. The country in which Ms. Qiu lived was the Qing Empire, which was being bullied by powerful neighbors and had a corrupt internal administration. The society in which Ms. Qiu lived was a feudal society. The family in which Ms. Qiu lived was an old-fashioned patriarchal family. However, Ms. Qiu was able to transcend everything and die for family revolution, racial revolution, and even social revolution. Not only is her spirit of sacrifice enough to encourage the weak and establish the timid, but judging from her talent and ideas, she is also a rare talent in history. Today, as we commemorate her, we should recognize the following aspects of her:</p>
<p>First, when women's education had not yet flourished, Ms. Qiu was in an old-fashioned family. She was able to avoid being swallowed by patriarchal ideology. In addition to studying old books, she read extensively in Chinese and foreign newspapers and absorbed ideas from all aspects to complete her own revolutionary propositions. This spirit of studiousness and deep thinking is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Second, Ms. Qiu was married to a man surnamed Wang and had children. Because she felt the pain of inequality between men and women, she was able to avoid being bound by feudal ideology, disregarded everything to leave her family, and went abroad to study alone. She resolutely joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) founded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and engaged in revolutionary activities with her comrades. This brave revolutionary spirit is not only rare for ordinary women, but also not easy for those who call themselves revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Third, after Ms. Qiu returned to China from Japan, she founded the China Women's News and ran the Mingdao Women's School in order to save the two hundred million women from male oppression, seeking the true liberation of women. At the same time, she presided over the Datong Sports Association founded by Xu Xilin. She compiled the Restoration Army and the Dare-to-Die Corps to lead the revolution with action. This practical and striving spirit is by no means comparable to those who merely talk about liberation and revolution.</p>
<p>From the above facts, we know that Ms. Qiu's personality is great, her insights are outstanding, her thoughts are advanced, and her actions are brave. Ms. Qiu's implementation of the revolution was in the hope of overthrowing the corrupt Qing government and achieving enlightened governance and a reasonable society. Ms. Qiu's advocacy of women's education and equal rights between men and women was to give women the opportunity to study and be independent, and to achieve equal status with men. She said that the cause was difficult and would take decades to achieve its goals. Indeed, more than twenty years later, women's education is prevalent and men and women are equal. However, what is the personality, status, and ability of women? All we see are six batches of "[square hat]" ornaments that can only consume and cannot produce being manufactured in various schools every year; all we see are disturbing news about rape, abandonment, suicide, and demands for alimony being revealed in various newspapers! To seek talents like Ms. Qiu who strive to transform the personal environment, the social environment, and the national environment, it seems that I have not yet discovered any, with my narrow knowledge. This is worthy of deep reflection by women's circles—especially on this day of commemorating Ms. Qiu!</p>
<h3>About Qiu Jin the Poet</h3>
<p>— Chong Hen</p>
<p>Qiu Jin was originally a poet, but her status as a poet was overshadowed by her career. As long as we dissect Qiu Jin's life trajectory, we can see that she exudes the temperament of a poet everywhere. Her chivalry, her generous and tragic songs, and her dissatisfaction with her original background all prove that she possesses the romantic essence of a poet. Needless to say, her last words at the time of her sacrifice, the words that used the line of poetry "[Autumn rain and autumn wind sadden people to death]" to replace her confession, fully displayed her life as a poet.</p>
<p>Qiu Jin was born in the late Qing Dynasty, her era was when imperialism began to reach out to China, and it was also when Chinese national thought began to open its eyes. A series of events in her era were: the Sino-Japanese War, the Hundred Days' Reform, and the Boxer Rebellion. This inevitably made her keenly aware that the ruling class had to be overthrown. Being on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution, she was even more pushed by the actual movements of the time and increasingly wanted to rise up and do the work of: national salvation. In this way, her revolutionary life was formed, and at the same time, her swan song of poetry was produced.</p>
<p>Her poetry can be said to be especially outstanding among the always small number of female poets in China. As long as we flip through her posthumous collection, we can find that in her poems and lyrics</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of Qiu Jin's Life</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>It has been a full twenty-seven years since Ms. Qiu Jin's martyrdom. Her life deeds have all become obvious historical traces. However, the editors of this publication believe that Ms. Qiu's spirit—the revolutionary spirit—should be re-emphasized, so before the anniversary of her martyrdom is near, they asked me to write this manuscript. Unfortunately, on the day of Ms. Qiu's martyrdom, I was far away in the remote mountains playing with a group of children, and I did not know her appearance or actions at all. Years ago, when I traveled to Hangzhou, I often interacted with Ms. Xu Xiaoshu, Ms. Qiu's highly talented student, and only then did I get some general ideas.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu's name is Jin. An Xuanqing, styled herself as the Female Knight of Jianhu, a native of Shanyin County, Zhejiang. Her father was an official who gave birth to her in Fujian; later he was transferred to Hunan, and he betrothed her to a wealthy gentleman surnamed Wang in Xiangtan as his daughter-in-law, and she bore one son and one daughter. She lived with the Wang family in Beijing for many years. The Hundred Days' Reform and the Boxer Rebellion gave her unlimited stimulation. She wanted to break out of the boudoir and the family, and take on the heavy responsibility of saving the country. At this time, she wrote in a [Man Jiang Hong] ci poem:</p>
<p>Staying briefly in Jinghua, it is already the Mid-Autumn Festival. For the chrysanthemums blooming all over the fence, the autumn scenery is like wiping. The four sides are broken by the remnants of Chu, and the eight years of flavor are missed from Zhejiang. I am forced to be made an eyebrow, but I am not willing. I cannot be listed as a man, but my heart is fiercer than a man's. My life's loyalty is always heated because of people. Who recognizes my vulgar breast? The hero's last road should be tempered. Where can I find a confidant in the red dust? My green shirt is wet.</p>
<p>Within her social circle of official families, there were, of course, some vulgar people who tasted their conscience and enjoyed wealth and honor. Where else could there be figures who cared about the rise and fall of the country? Therefore, she had to sigh deeply that [where can I find a confidant in the red dust], and even cried and wept, her green shirt completely soaked.</p>
<p>But when the time came, she finally decided to break through this mediocre and dim environment, break through the shackles of women crouching under the old ethics; she flew far away and went to Japan to study.</p>
<p>The matter happened like this; in a certain month of the 30th year of Guangxu, a revolutionary newcomer was arrested and imprisoned in Beijing. Everyone knows that the official prisons of the Qing Dynasty had many places where money could be used to get things done. Our enthusiastic Ms. Qiu, who loved the country and admired the revolution, had her loyalty that was always heated for people greatly boiling. She took off her own hairpins and ornaments and secretly sent six hundred yuan for the release movement fee for that unknown prisoner. This incident ignited the anger of the man surnamed Wang, and the two made a big commotion. She abandoned her family and boarded a ship to Japan. The man surnamed Wang was so anxious that he chased her to the shipyard and demanded the Wang family's belongings from her. She threw the only luggage, the brocade quilt, from the bow of the ship. In this way, she breathed the fresh air of the Pacific Ocean. At this time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was organizing the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in Tokyo, Japan, and Ms. Qiu was the first to join. She also introduced many comrades from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to join the party. Whenever there was a gathering, she would definitely take the stage and give a passionate speech, advocating revolution, which made the Qing government uneasy and secretly told the Japanese to find ways to ban it. The Japanese revised a regulation to crack down on studying abroad, and most of the students returned home in anger. Ms. Qiu was one of them. The Wang family had a father who heard that she had returned to the country and insisted that she return to Hunan. Because the party army was in economic difficulties, she also took the plan to count. When she got there, she pretended to owe a lot of debts outside, and the old man gave them all to her, but he was very strict in guarding against her actions.</p>
<p>One day, she said she was going to the temple to watch a play, and the family saw that she had dressed the children neatly and brought them along, so they didn't suspect anything. Unexpectedly, she sat in a sedan chair to the theater, settled the children on the stage, and flew away.</p>
<p>Returning to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, she taught at Xunxi Women's School in Nanxun. Soon she went to Shanghai to preside over the Tongmenghui's communication agency, and often made explosives. Once, the medicine exploded and she almost faced danger. At the same time, she published the China Women's News, inside which was a publication speech that was truly clangorous and moving. In the 33rd year of Guangxu, she returned to Shaoxing to preside over the Mingdao Women's School. Because Xu Xilin had already aspired to enter Anhui, he entrusted the Datong Sports Association that he had run in Shaoxing entirely to Ms. Qiu. This association had content and was purely preparing for revolutionary military affairs, compiling the eight armies of [Restoring the Han Nationality and Greatly Revitalizing National Power], called the Restoration Army. In May of this year, it had been roughly formed, waiting for Xu Xilin to start an uprising in Anhui, and she would respond in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>On May 25th, Xu Xilin assassinated Governor Enming in Anhui, and was killed after the event failed. At this time, the city was full of wind and rain. Ms. Qiu told her comrades to temporarily avoid it, and she remained in the Datong school. On the night of June 5th, she was finally arrested after being betrayed by a traitor. At first, she was imprisoned in the Shanyin County Office. Because there was no confession, Magistrate Li Zhongyu did not execute her. Shaoxing Prefect Gui Fu was furious, so Magistrate Li sent the entire case to the Prefectural Governor and hanged himself.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu was usually good at covering up, so she had close relations with Gui Fu. That night, Gui Fu personally interrogated her, asking her if she had any accomplices. She said [Yes]. Gui Fu asked who it was, and she said [It's you]. Gui Fu was so frightened that he dared not ask any further, so he gave her paper and pen and told her to write a confession. She picked up the pen and only wrote the famous poem [Autumn rain and autumn wind sadden people to death]. At 3 a.m. on June 6th, she was killed at Xuanting in Shaoxing Prefecture. Her boiling hot blood, along with the long night, was sprinkled under the cold, autumn-like green blade. She was only thirty-three years old.</p>
<p>She did not see the fall of the Qing Dynasty, nor did she participate in the merits of the Xinhai Revolution. However, was her blood shed in vain? Mr. Tan Sitong did not learn from the escape of Kang Liang and others after the Wuxu coup. At that time, he had a famous saying that [When have you ever seen a successful major reform without bloodshed?] Indeed, the bloodshed of their martyrs was the prelude to the success of the Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<p>Some people believe that Ms. Qiu was only limited to racial revolution, which is a regrettable thing. In fact, this does not harm Ms. Qiu. For a figure of an era, one only needs to be able to be a pioneer of that era, and one cannot demand that he be a pioneer of generations later. If Ms. Qiu was born today, she would have another kind of thought. Looking at her song [Compatriots' Suffering], even when concentrating on the idea of racial revolution, she was already able to pay attention to all aspects of politics and society. The original song has four verses, and two verses are now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots' suffering, compatriots' suffering is as bitter as coptis chinensis. The pressure is a thousand pounds and it is difficult to make yourself comfortable. Ghosts and gods wail and are truly pitiful. Alas! The world says tyranny is as fierce as a tiger. When will we see a year of injustice? The sound card is all over the land like a forest. There are hundreds of millions of patrols and officials. Fierce as jackals and poisonous as snakes, they drool at the sight of property. I must, must, must raise troops to sweep away the poisonous fog and see the blue sky. Hand-held white blades search for traitors, and sacrificing lives to save the people is a sage.</p>
<p>Compatriots' suffering, compatriots' suffering is as bitter as coptis chinensis. Whipping compatriots like dogs and horses, the traitors treat themselves like gods. There are smoke paste donations and wine donations, and all kinds of house donations and shop donations. Even the slightest socks and shoes are taken as donations, and not even a single grass or tree is spared. I must, must, must raise troops to sweep away the poisonous fog and see the blue sky. Hand-held white blades search for traitors, and sacrificing lives to save the people is a sage.</p>
<p>In terms of action, her life was to break through the old family, break through the old ethics, and then seek to overthrow the dark alien rule, so that the motherland would gradually prosper. In terms of literature, she also made great achievements. She broke the common practice of ordinary people since the Ming and Qing dynasties of only finding some stale words and rotten characters and desperately putting them together to become poems and lyrics. Her posthumous works are all creative and full of life. Looking at her short life, she did her best in all aspects and showed the spirit of revolution in all aspects.</p>
<p>Today is again the fourth day of the lunar June, standing on the eve of Ms. Qiu's martyrdom anniversary, imagining her singing [Autumn rain and autumn wind sadden people to death] and going to the execution ground with passion and excitement, how can people not wave their fists and dance, and raise their hair and stare, only wanting to rush towards the evil forces and dark circles she encountered?</p>
<p>Apart from a few poems in the early period that were purely chanting personal sadness, most of the other poems and lyrics are overflowing with revolutionary enthusiasm. The beauty of her poems is generally woven from two kinds of thoughts: the first is national thought, and the second is women's rights thought. And these two thoughts are precisely the greatest products of her era.</p>
<p>I believe that when talking about Qiu Jin's poems, one must understand the two kinds of thoughts contained in her poems. Because this is the true value of Qiu Jin, and this is why Qiu Jin is Qiu Jin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have [A Collection of the Works of the Female Knight Qiu Jin] at hand, so I can only recall some of her famous lines from memory as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding national thought: There is no way to refine stones to ask Nüwa, and the white horse passes the gap to feel the passing of time. The tragedy of partitioning is close at hand, and shouting is useless. The motherland has a responsibility to sink, and I have no home to wander in the end of the world. A heart full of enthusiasm is sad to look back, and the intestines are broken and it is difficult to be a May flower.</p>
<p>Hearing that the ancient battleground still bears the bloodstains today. The dream of riding horses in the Central Plains, the broken rivers and mountains, shame the old country. There is no right to the territorial waters, so it is sad and lonely. There is a day to sharpen the knife and quickly avenge the hatred. The wind blows coldly, and ten thousand clouds and smoke are collected in the eyes.</p>
<p>I sigh that Shenzhou is sinking, and I am ashamed to steal my life without any plan to save the time. There is a wish to fight for the revival of Chu, and there is no cone to strike against the tyranny of Qin. Only when the country is broken do we know that the human species is cheap, and righteousness is high and does not hinder the poverty of guests. I hate that I have not rewarded my comrades for my business, so I hold my sword and sing sadly with tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>Say return, where to return? Looking back, the motherland is still snoring. Foreign insults are invading, the content is corrupt, and there is no hero to be the master. Alas, God is blind: to see such a country, how can I bear to return to the barbarians? Pea-split melon sharing, all for my homeland.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding women's rights thought</p>
<p>Who is generous and speaks the same hatred? Who recognizes Guo Jie's flow in those days? The current situation is so dangerous, I am willing to exchange Min clothing for Wu hooks. Dirty world, how many men are British and wise? It is only in the ranks of beautiful eyebrows that we occasionally hear of outstanding people: Liangyu's merits and tears on her chest, and Yunying's career and blood in her heart. I drunkenly caress my long sword and make a dragon's chant, the sound is sad and choked. The incense of freedom, I always think of burning it: the hatred of family and country. When will it be vented? Seeing us today, each should work hard. Zhenba must think about settling the species, and prosperity must not only boast of clothing and jue, but the three inches of arched shoes are too useless, and should be reformed!</p>
<p>I hope you will reverse the declining trend and promote solid learning. Lotus tongue with latent splendor, deafening voice. Wake up the sisters of the world, listen to the five watch bells!</p>

<h3>On Women (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maxim Gorky, Translated by Fan Ji</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>In [Cultural Dawn], women's labor experience is far more complex than men's. Women are not only equal collaborators with men in society, but also surpass them in wisdom. Therefore, in a certain period of history, power in families, nations, and even tribes belonged to women. Ancient Greek writers said that among the Scythian and Slavic peoples, there was a type of female commune that owned land and other property. Undoubtedly, this situation also existed in the matriarchal clan system preserved by [Barbarians] (this matriarchal clan system still existed in the nineteenth century), such as the nobles of Verkhoyansk during the Tsarist era. From ancient Russian stories, one can also see the existence of such female communes among the Slavs. This ancient story says that a man from Ilya met his son, but the son did not recognize his father. Later, the mother pointed out a mark, and the son recognized him. The legend of the Amazons also says: The story of the ancient Serbian female hero [Alexander] mentions that there were female knight teams in the army of Alexander the Great. An old Czech legend also says that in the eighth century, women killed their husbands and defended themselves on high mountains, fighting successive wars with men for seven years. In Russian legends, there are also many stories of female heroes. Regarding women's intelligence and their conquest of the power of nature, such as the story of [Saint Vasilisa], they exist in the folk songs of various nations. [Female prophets], so-called shamans, female immortals, etc., can all be classified into this category. All of this suggests that, in addition to the natural wonder and special abilities of women, men in a certain period were dominated by women. Perhaps some [rules] were set up by women for self-defense and other reasons, to prevent men's necessary infringement during the last months of pregnancy, and to restrict the freedom of [strong men]'s actions.</p>
<p>Stories and legends have been preserved in large numbers. From Adam and Eve in the Bible, all unanimously say that women work for the devil, [not out of fear, but out of conscience]. They have no purpose of profiting themselves, but strive to do evil to mankind. Faust made a deal with the devil to regain his youth, but the witch did not try to regain her youth and beauty. Therefore, researchers of witches and witchcraft do not pay attention to this inexplicable fairness, although it is commonly believed that women's desire to remain young, healthy, and beautiful forever is also their flaw.</p>
<p>The struggle of men against the dominance of women in housework and life occurred simultaneously with the beginning of the disintegration of clans, the opposition between clans and families, and the development of private property. Men were influenced by women's rule for thousands of years. Later, he gradually broke away from being a laborer and became a worker, first as an assistant to women, then as an equal worker with women, and finally as the main labor force in cultivating land and making materials, especially in the period when they began to use their domesticated animals to transport things and plow the land. Men's position in the clan, unable to marry within his wife's clan or be an equal member of society, was not commensurate with the role he played in the economy. Therefore, in the following thousands of years, men waged a stubborn struggle, advocating that men be the heads of the family: advocating that children be recognized as men's children, not the children of their birth mothers, that children should belong to the father's clan, not the mother's clan: and advocating that private property be recognized as the private property of men and their clan, not the property of the wife and her clan. This struggle was very serious, because with the development of labor, women did not lag behind men, and she gradually became more skilled, experienced, and capable in her work. Men only had strength. Their struggle was a struggle to seize power, with the aim of depriving women of their life experience, and they finally achieved this goal 丨丨 conquering women and making [women men's domestic dogs].</p>
<p>Men even made the hearth the hearth of their clan. The myth of Prometheus stealing fire from heaven was probably fabricated by priests in the beginning. It deprived women of the merit of inventing fire, but later this myth became contrary to divine will.</p>
<p>Nothing comes from nothing. Although the stories of fighting female knights cannot be in the form as described in ancient legends, it is clear that they always existed in some way. [The Rape of the Sabine Women] (a story in ancient Italian history) can be said to be due to the lack of women in Rome. Not only was it necessary to plunder women because they were women, but also because women could spin yarn and weave cloth. [Kidnapping] girls can generally be explained as an attempt to steal good women from neighboring families to serve as slaves. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Women's Movement</p>
<p>[Women's Movement] is the struggle of women to break free from the shackles imposed on them by society for thousands of years and to seek freedom and equality for mankind. According to the current international situation, there are approximately two different tendencies: One is to demand that under the current social system, women can enjoy economic, political, and social equality with men 丨丨 In other words, women in this tendency only hope to improve the current situation and can consider themselves satisfied: The other is to believe that women's true liberation can only be realized by fundamentally transforming the society. Therefore, the means used by women belonging to this tendency are often more drastic than the former, and they are firmly united with men in the same tendency.</p>
<p>Women's Suffrage</p>
<p>[Women's Suffrage] refers to the fact that women have explicit provisions in the law to enjoy the same voting and eligibility rights as men in the landlord parliament and national assembly. The most prominent country in the world that grants women's suffrage is Wyoming in the United States (USA), followed by countries that have successively opened up the female ban. The story saying women are witches, sorcerers, demons, messengers and slaves of evil spirits, gods, etc.,</p>
<h3>Differences in Suicide Methods Between Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Translated from English</p>
<p>丨丨Statistics from British Scholars丨丨</p>
<p>Men and women have considerable differences in personality and emotions, which we can see in daily life. Dr. George Kirk, a British scholar, published the methods used by male and female suicides in Europe over the past twenty years, with the following differences:</p>
<p>Method　　Man　　　　　Woman</p>
<p>Hanging　　417　　240</p>
<p>Drowning　　152　　260</p>
<p>Self-mutilation　　207　　129</p>
<p>Poisoning　　79　　145</p>
<p>Shooting　　67　　2</p>
<p>Jumping down (from a high place)　　21　　36</p>
<p>Being run over　　24　　8</p>
<p>Other　　33　　18</p>
<p>The above figures are per 1,000 people.</p>
<p>According to the above, hanging is the most common for men, and drowning is the most common for women: Shooting and suicide on railways are more common among men, while poisoning and jumping down are more common among women. Hanging, self-mutilation, and suicide with a pistol, etc., require considerable preparation and are accompanied by terrifying feelings, which are generally not very chosen by women. Conversely, simple and easy methods such as poisoning and drowning seem to be more easily adopted by women.</p>

<h3>Finance: Swap Prices Not Significant; Bid Price Retreats by More Than Three Yuan; August Futures Contracts Total 16,982; New September Contracts Total 25,830</h3>
<p>The gold market was weaker yesterday, mainly because the bulls were arrogant before the swap, and the general shorts were apprehensive. Unexpectedly, the swap opened yesterday morning, with only the buying side posting a little over five yuan, which was only so-so. The Tianjin gang frantically sold spot goods, and the general bulls and spot firms bravely sold off futures bid prices. The selling pressure suddenly turned turbulent, and the last Guang gang and others purchased to stabilize the price after it broke through the 90-yuan mark. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in both the UK and the US showed a contraction, and the forward silver price on the five-gold exchange also fell by nine haos to four lis, but it was not as good as the opening. The exchange rate was extremely flat. London bullion rose one penny, US cotton rose 29 pound tones, and US wheat rose another 2.875 to 3.375. Stock prices had both ups and downs, and it seemed inappropriate to open high. However, due to the swap relationship, the over-the-counter pre-market trading opened relatively stable, but the key to the rise and fall at this moment depends on the level of the premium. Unexpectedly, the swap pre-market was quoted with the buying side posting five to six yuan. The general bulls liquidated, and even spot firms intended to sell off, resulting in a selling wind after the opening. Many major</p>
<p>bulls divested, and the sellers took the opportunity to be active. Spot firms also dumped. The HSBC listed exchange rates for both the UK and the US did not change, and the domestic market stepped down. The gold market then broke through the 90-yuan mark. Afterwards, swap rates were cheap and then expensive. The Guang gang and others took the opportunity to purchase contracts at low prices, and the exchange rate also slightly improved. There were still many buyers taking advantage of the low prices, and the situation turned stable. The price gradually rose but was still struggling. Afterwards, the swap rate stabilized, and the gold market also showed a stable state. The Seattle night market silver price reported a contraction of 25.125 and a half-point, and market sentiment was healthy. At noon, there was a lot of hesitation. The market situation fluctuated with the swap, which was very mediocre. The swap rate was quoted with the buying side posting four yuan to five yuan and seven jiaos. At present, the swap situation is such that the bulls are mostly Dalian gang, Wanxing, and Shunli, with a total of over 10,000 contracts. Fuchang and Dadecheng are second. The shorts are all spot firms, followed by Yicheng, Fuyu, Shenkang, Hengyu, etc. The red gold price is calculated at 1,003 yuan and two jiaos. Tianjin goods are quoted with an additional ten yuan and a half, and the supply is quite strong. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 994 yuan and seven jiaos, which was still half a yuan higher than the previous closing. Items opened at four yuan and six jiaos. The exchange rate opened near-term, with the selling price for the British exchange rate at one shilling, four pence, one-eight-seven-five, and the US exchange rate at 33 yuan and nine-three-seven-five. The swap rate was unfavorable, and the general bulls were very discouraged. Yongli, Dadecheng, Yingfenghang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Richang, Fuyu, Hengyu Yuqingyong, Wanxing, Dinggeng, Futaiheng, and Senchangyong continuously sold off contracts. Maijiari sold US dollars for October at 3.125. It was expected that the HSBC listing would be announced, and both the UK and the US were flat. The price then broke through the 90-yuan mark and retreated to 89 yuan and a half. Huixiang vigorously purchased contracts, once rising to 90 yuan and three jiaos. The premium was still cheap. The news of the influx of spot goods made the sellers even more excited. Yuyu, Yuqingyong, and Zhaofengchang vigorously divested. Maijiari sold US dollars for September at 25, further lowering the price to 88 yuan and six jiaos. Afterwards, the swap premium rose after falling. Fuyu, Tongyi, and Shengzai took the opportunity to purchase contracts at low prices, and the gold price also rose. Shengdaheng and Yu repeatedly advanced vigorously. Yongli, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Chengkang, Yuanmaoyong, Chunyuanyong, Shenkang, etc., all had buying interest. The domestic market was slightly tight, and the price rebounded to 91 yuan and nine jiaos. Mitsui sold US dollars for September at 1.875. Hengyu and Zhaofengchang vigorously supplied, and the price retreated to zero-one jiao. Shengda still advanced, and the price was pulled up again. Afterwards, Zhaofengchang sold out from time to time, but market sentiment was quite stable. Dadecheng and others bought. Pan Gen and San Pa sold US dollars for October at 3.125. Datong also had a hook-up and rose to one yuan and eight jiaos. After this, the swap rate stabilized, and the situation became flat. It hovered for a long time, mainly because the night market silver price reported a contraction of 25, and market sentiment was still stable. Afterwards, Fuan and the item supplier provided contracts, lowering the price to zero-five jiaos. There were still buyers in the market. It was heard that the night market silver price reported a contraction of 25, and the price once rebounded to one yuan and six jiaos. Pan Gen and Zhengjin sold US dollars for September at 1.875. Yuqingyong, Dadecheng, and Fuyu and Tongtaichang came to sell, lowering the price to zero-seven jiaos. After hesitating, the noon closing was 991 yuan and one jiao, and the item price was one yuan and two jiaos. After the closing, the premium was even lower, and the gold market was also slightly weak. It was found that the highest price during the first half of the day was 994 yuan and seven jiaos, and the lowest price was 988 yuan and six jiaos, with a rise and fall of six yuan and one jiao. As a result, the price fell by three yuan and one jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was such that the HSBC Bank's US exchange rate listing did not change, still at 33 yuan and six-two-five, corresponding to a bid gold price of 1,029 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 38 yuan under, which was three yuan more under than the previous closing. The August registered price was 991 yuan, and the September price was 986 yuan. The morning supplementary water price was 990 yuan. The red gold price was calculated at 1,003 yuan and two jiaos. The influx of spot goods was quite large, and the momentum was fierce. Due to the swap relationship, the appetite of fellow traders turned healthy. Tianjin goods were quoted with an additional ten yuan, zero, four, and five jiaos. The Tianjin gang sold a total of over 10,000 taels to various spot firms. In addition to spot firms posting swaps, there were also many who dumped futures bids in preparation for cash settlement, which directly affected the August and September swaps.</p>
<p>There were more sellers in the market. In summary, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Dingkang, Yuqingyong, Dadecheng, Yingfenghang, Tongchun, Yongde Hengtai, Hengchangyong, Dingtai, Fuchang, Yifengyong, and Senchangyong were on the selling side.

The Guang gang Shengda advanced approximately 300 to 400 contracts. Hengxing had little advance or retreat. The total number of contracts traded on the day was 87,549 for August and 16,982 for September.</p>
<p>Regarding the August-September swap, the bulls were particularly arrogant beforehand. When the formal trading opened yesterday, the initial shout was for the bulls to post five yuan and a half, but there was no pressure. Buyers such as Shunli, Fuan, Yuanshengyong, Yuanyi, Fuyu, Tongtaichang, and Chunyuanyong and Yingfenghang came to post, and the situation deteriorated. The price gradually retreated to around four yuan, mainly due to the extremely strong supply of spot goods. Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Yuanchangyong, Senchangyong, Hanheng, Heng , Qingfayong, and Dafayong and Zhengchang posted in succession.</p>
<p>Although there was a mid-way water issue , Yifengyong, Yuanchun, and Dadecheng posted, the situation still didn't improve . At 10:00 AM, the official opening price was the buying side posting five yuan and six jiaos. Fuchang posted out, and Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, and Yuanheng posted in. Specifically at nine yuan and six-seven jiaos, Bingxing, Dachangxiang, Shengda, and Dafengheng posted in, lowering the price to five yuan and three jiaos. Ruixing, Senchang, Yongfuxingyong, and Dayuyong Qianchangxiang Shenkang and Hengyu posted out, and the price was still able to rise to five yuan and six jiaos, but Dadecheng, Chunyuanyong, Dafengheng, and Yuanheng dropped out again and retreated to five yuan and one jiao. Dingkang posted out, and the price was still able to recover, but Yuan, Yuanmaoyong, Shengda, Yuqingyong, Dachangxiang, Hengxing, and Yuanchun posted in again and again, and the price collapsed. At the closing, the price fell to the buying side posting four and a half yuan, and after the closing, Yuanchun, Yuanheng, Dachangxiang, Huixiang, Hengyu, and Tongtaichang posted in again, and the price fell to around four yuan.

<h3>Banking and Money Industry Severely Affected by Drought</h3>
<p>Crop failure... Sluggish transactions</p>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot in recent days, and there are few people in the market. Business in all areas is unusually idle. In addition, the severe drought and lack of rain has become a disaster, especially a major blow to commerce. Therefore, the current situation in the financial world has no possibility of recovery. The foreign interbank lending rate in the market fell again yesterday by one cent, calculated at five cents. The morning and noon were the same. There was no water added to the interbank lending rate at the beginning, but later, because the backing was slightly exhausted, two or three cents of water was added. The volume of interbank lending transactions was over 2.6 million in the morning market, and over 300,000 in new transactions. The volume of transactions was over 200,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Consistently Decline</h3>
<p>Prices Fluctuate Between Two or Three Jiao to Eighty or Ninety Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed a slight recovery. The continuous decline in recent days prompted bulls to emerge, which is very common at these high prices. However, over the past five days, those selling short have also been very active, accumulating large short positions. As the settlement date gradually approaches, fierce competition is expected. Yesterday, although there were buy orders for the 4th series at the opening, there were significant sell orders for the 5th and 16th series, preventing the market from stabilizing. The former series slightly declined by two or three jiao. Salt tax bonds were relatively stable, while the 96 series fell by more than half a yuan. In the subsequent trading session, sell orders continued to pour in, and swap transactions were also quite active, leading to further declines of one jiao to half a yuan. The forward prices of the June main series fell significantly. As a result, market prices declined by two or three jiao to as much as eighty or ninety jiao. The trend is expected to be a recovery after a period of fluctuation. The total trading volume was 13,075,000 yuan.

<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung &amp; Co. stated that yesterday (July 12th), the New York stock market initially weakened due to poor railway freight reports released this week, causing railway stocks to decline first, and the overall market followed suit. Later, the market rebounded due to the strength of Chicago wheat, with gold and silver stocks rising. Although the forward silver market was weak, United States Smelting Refining and Mining Company (a leader in silver stocks) rose to $136, creating a new high for the year. The market on the small exchange was uneven, with bonds weakening, and U.S. government bonds slightly declining, while other stocks showed mixed movements. German public bonds remained stable. Wheat buying was strong, a rare occurrence in recent months, once reaching the $1 mark. This was due to positive news regarding wheat crops in Canada, Argentina, and Europe. The total daily trading volume was 530,000 shares (securities). The market situation was firm, with high demand for several stocks. (New wheat from each bushel being listed, was swiftly absorbed by flour mills at a premium), forward prices lagging behind spot prices. (Corn) The market is expected to rise, and it is advisable to buy when prices decline. (Cotton) The market rose due to the lack of significant rainfall in Texas and the strength of wheat. There were sell orders when prices rose, but the pressure dissipated due to the anticipation of weather developments in Texas. Factories purchased a total of 161,000 bales this week. (Rubber) Market sentiment was stable and trading was quiet. Singapore and London were firm, with prices higher than New York's average. (Sugar) The market was calm, with small quantities of Philippine goods being offered at 1/8 of a cent. Buyers were generally willing to pay 1/5 of a cent. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Yarn Market Boosted by Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending stronger, with a slight rise in prices. This is due to the discovery of new highs in American cotton, which has stirred sentiment. The rising cotton prices have led to a corresponding rise in the yarn market. At the same time, the real demand from the South continues to be healthy, and selling pressure has been slightly curbed. However, the near-term market is sluggish due to issues with receiving goods, while there is strong interest in long-term positions. The market outlook is stable.</p>
<h3>Forward Prices Up One Yuan Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>The morning session of the yarn market opened with American cotton up 30 points, and the previous day's spot yarn sales were good, further strengthening the market.

<h3>Flour and Wheat Skyrocket - Creates Opportunities for Foreign Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>The flour market, after opening this morning, showed signs of skyrocketing prices for each month. Sixth-grade wheat quotations, Chicago up another 90 jiao to 1 yuan 1 jiao, Canada up 34 jiao, coupled with persistent drought, hot and clear weather, and no signs of rain, rice prices rose sharply daily, causing widespread anxiety. Therefore, prices rose immediately after opening by 23%, after which various factories, due to the gradual increase in the prices of wheat, both in this port and outside the port, following the price of rice, and the difficulty of purchasing goods in the future, had no choice but to wait and see, unable to sell. Therefore, the sentiment outside the industry became firmer, gradually buying, and market prices gradually increased. Although real sales groups unanimously rejected it, and the Tianjin group remained motionless, the intensity of the sentiment did not diminish. This situation of continuous rise and increase is little different from the great flood of 1919. It is feared that the result of high prices will still require foreign wheat to be used for relief. As a result, this month rose 3%, AugustSeptember rose 4%7.5, October rose 5%2.5, November rose 5%, December rose 5.5%.</p>
<p>The wheat market showed an enthusiastic rise in prices for all months, with foreign wheat quotations up by a significant 349 jiao to 1 yuan 1 jiao. In addition, wheat prices in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places also gradually followed the rise in rice prices, and in some places, they even exceeded the standard of Shanghai. As a result, market sentiment was stirred, and prices for each month jumped sharply after opening, rising by 56% to 10% compared to the previous day. By the opening of the afternoon session, due to the soaring flour market in the morning, market sentiment became even more turbulent. This month rose to 2 jiao 2 fen, August rose to 3 jiao 5 fen, September rose to 5 jiao 1 fen, October rose to 5 jiao 7 fen, November rose to 6 jiao 2 fen, December rose to 6 jiao 6 fen. Later, the leading bull traders released their positions, and prices saw a significant drop. Prices for September fell by 9% from the opening to the closing prices, while the rest fell by 35%, indicating that the market was not following normal rules amidst speculative frenzy. As a result, July still skyrocketed by 1 jiao 5 fen, August rose by 1 jiao 3 fen, September rose by 1 jiao 1 fen, October rose by 1 jiao 2 fen, November rose by 1 jiao 1 fen, and December rose by 9 fen. The spot wheat market also saw prices rise by 78% to 10% due to rice prices and standard relationships. The opening prices for Xuzhou wheat were 3 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, Bengbu wheat 3 yuan 2 jiao 2 fen, Suzhou wheat 3 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen, Mingguang wheat 3 yuan 2 jiao, Baoying wheat 3 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen, Liuhe wheat 3 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen, Wuhu wheat 3 yuan, and Xinghua wheat 3 yuan 0 fen, with Fuxin and Fufeng each purchasing 5,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Daily</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various groups for the 20th number (approximately 3,000 shi) was limited due to the extreme drought conditions, and prices rose steadily. Therefore, although the distribution routes were limited, prices soared easily. Today, the supply of rice from the packaging stomach has stopped, with only the local street taking action, and the tight situation is even more severe. The prices of the Changbang Su, Tong, and Nangang japonica rice have increased by another 56 jiao, while the prices of Qingjiao, Song, Si, and Xilian late rice have also risen by more than half a yuan. The prices of Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan and other varieties have also risen by more than 23 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various routes downstream was scarce due to drought and siltation of waterways, resulting in only ten or so ships arriving. The city's various types of distribution routes, white japonica and thin rice, continued to move, and the prices of white japonica and thin early rice rose again by 45 jiao. The supply of Baiyuan, Yangdu, and Jianling rice was still acceptable, and the prices also increased by 34 jiao. Customers from other ports, local streets, and surrounding rural areas made some transactions, and the prices increased by 2 jiao.</p>
<p>(Additional News) The current price increase is mostly due to market sentiment. The so-called "the more the price rises, the more people want to buy, and the more the price rises, the less people are willing to sell." Yesterday, it was heard that the central government was considering buying 500,000 shi of foreign rice to regulate the market if rice prices rise. This kind of rumor remains to be seen, but at the current rice prices, combined with the old sea dou, the number is not small. Looking back from the beginning to the most recent month ago, rice prices were very small. In less than a month, prices have risen by 45 yuan due to this year's drought, and the profit from hoarding rice is too high, causing great hardship to the general public.</p>
<h3>Old Small Jiao Soars to Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Will Take the Opportunity to Import</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Surges by 35 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market experienced skyrocketing prices, soaring again and again, with upward sentiment and extreme market tension. This was due to the recent hot and rainless weather, with reports of drought in various places, dried-up waterways, disrupted supply, and gradually decreasing arrivals. In addition, the rice-producing areas in the mainland were insufficient to meet their own needs and rushed to purchase rice from the Shanghai market. In recent days, in addition to the local hoarders who eagerly purchased rice, various groups from Yongshao, Chongsha, etc., also inquired about prices, making the cargo owners' sentiment even better. Hoarders only received and did not release rice, so the market repeatedly experienced price increases. Yesterday, 20,000 bags of small rice were offered, and 12,700 bags of various types of milled rice were offered. Machine-milled oil rice suddenly rose by half a yuan, with the highest price being 9 yuan 7 jiao, machine Jing rice rising to 9 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, and oil milled rice rising to 8 yuan. Various milled rice from Hankou, Mingguang, and Shashi reached 7 yuan 56 jiao. The opening price of small rice was 8 yuan 8 jiao, and then it rose to 9 yuan. This rice, which was actually old rice from 1923, was able to fetch such a high price, and other rice prices were bound to rise one by one, which was 5 jiao and 34 jiao higher than the previous market. The sentiment of the hoarders remained strong, and they were still bullish on the market. However, by the afternoon, foreign firms such as Dafu and Yuanli had arrived on the market to solicit orders, because the local market price of Western small rice in Annam and Burma was already lower than the Shanghai market. Even with the addition of taxes, it could barely be profitable, but there was no high profit. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned two foreign firms, there were other foreign firms seeking to solicit orders. On the one hand, they planned to find ways to request tax reductions, so as to lower costs and indirectly allow poor people to obtain lower-priced rice. After this news spread throughout the market, old small rice fell by 12 jiao, and other rice prices stabilized. The last opening price of small rice was only 8 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Soybeans Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the second batch of Jiujiang New City Gate soybeans had not yet arrived. The remaining 82 bags from the previous opening were sold by the Yong group at the original price. It was heard that there may be changes in the trend of the later batches, because the grains were thin and stiff, and it was feared that it would be difficult to sell at a good price. The market price of high-quality old soybeans was easy to increase due to sporadic sales, so it continued to rise. The factories had a medium-grade, but it was not strong, causing the market to stabilize. Yesterday, it was estimated that the opening of Zhengyangguan, two cars of soybeans, the whole river soybean two hundred bags, Yingzhou soybean eight or nine cars, Haozhou soybean three or four cars, and Wulongji soybean one car.</p>
<h3>North &amp; South Goods: First Batch of New Gold Mountain Branches Arrives</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Gold Mountain branches, shipped by the Taikoo Company's Shandong wheel, has arrived with more than one hundred and fifty boxes. The samples have not yet been seen. The opening price is expected to be on Monday, and it is predicted that the market price for higher-quality goods will be around 40 yuan per unit.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Luzhuang Superior Eyebrow Tea Sales to Europe are Turning Brisk</h3>
<p>Luzhuang superior eyebrow green tea. After being lowered once the previous day, yesterday, most merchants in the market, including British Zhuang, Xiehe, Jardine, Jinlong, and Tianyu, started searching for and purchasing goods from Maoyuan, Tunxi, Suian, and other places again. Sales were turning brisk. However, the selling price of Tunxi superior eyebrow tea, whose body was of inferior quality, had also shrunk to 989 yuan. The selling price of Suian superior eyebrow tea had shrunk to 83 yuan. Judging from the purchase cost of each store, they all have to lose money. Sales of Gongxi needle eyebrow pearl tea, etc., were still sluggish. There were no large transactions of Qimen and Lianghu red tea, etc.</p>
<h3>Metals: Over 5,000 Sheets of Newly Arrived East White Iron</h3>
<p>For the Eastern White Iron, which had been out of stock for many days, traders purchased goods from Osaka, Japan, to make a profit. It was found that over 5,000 sheets of 3-foot 7-foot 30-gauge were newly arrived. Therefore, those customers who were greedy for small profits quickly rushed to purchase them. The price of each sheet was estimated at 1 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen to 1 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Prices Are Very Strong</h3>
<p>The market for tinplate in this port is high (and the bottom is thin), so generally those with abundant financial resources are eager to collect and accumulate them (because the overseas price is higher than the Shanghai market by 1 jiao 5 fen). Therefore, there are many who seek to trade, but few who sell. The market price has invisibly risen by more than 1 yuan. Yesterday, the market price for 90-pound American goods was estimated at 16 yuan, 100-pound at 17 yuan, double-linked 90-pound at 32 yuan, 100-pound at 35 yuan, 90-pound German goods at 15 yuan, 100-pound at 16 yuan, double-linked 90-pound at 30 yuan, 100-pound at 30 yuan 5 jiao. The sentiment is very good.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation of China's Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>China is the oldest silk-producing country in the world. Logically, China's silk industry should have made special progress compared to other countries. However, upon close examination of the history of China's silk industry in recent years, the facts are quite different. Not only has the amount of silk exported gradually decreased, but the production of raw silk has also greatly declined. Exports have decreased from 189,000 dan (worth 147 million customs taels) in 1929 to 78,000 dan (worth only 32 million customs taels) in 1932. Regarding the production of raw silk, China has never had accurate statistics. However, judging from the recent decline of China's silk reeling industry and the sharp decline in exports over the years, we can know its approximate situation.</p>
<p>This decrease in exports and decline in production is partly due to the global economic panic, but the main reason lies in the backwardness of China's silk production technology. In name, China is the oldest silk-producing country, but in reality, the production methods currently used are completely following in the footsteps of other countries.</p>
<p>However, even in this problem of "following," there is still a sense of lagging behind.</p>
<p>The development of China's silk industry is primarily in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Next are Sichuan, Shandong, Anhui, and Hubei. The silk produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is mainly White Filature silk and Tussah silk, while Sichuan and Shandong mainly produce Yellow silk. High-quality White Filature silk was once priced at over 1,000 taels (per dan) in early 1932, but in 1933, it consistently hovered around 300 to 700 yuan (with only a price of 800 yuan in July). However, in terms of production costs, the spring cocoon costs 650 yuan, the summer cocoon costs 950 yuan, and the autumn cocoon costs 800 yuan. Under these circumstances, those engaged in the silk industry can only lose money.</p>
<p>Regarding the selling prices and costs of Tussah silk, Sichuan Yellow silk, and Shandong Yellow silk, the same can be inferred.</p>
<p>This situation of drastic price drops is partly due to the stagnation of foreign sales and partly due to excessive silk stocks.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of cocoon prices, the situation is also the same. Before 1929, each dan of native cocoons was worth 7080 yuan, but recently, even improved varieties are only worth 4050 yuan, while native varieties are only worth 2030 yuan.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, although the government issued silk industry bonds and established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Cocoon Registration and Promotion Committee last year (after registration, the government subsidized each dan of silk and cocoon exports with 140 yuan of public bonds, and the export tax was waived), due to various reasons, it only remedied a portion of the old silk and cocoons. After the two committees ended in May of last year, silk and cocoon prices gradually plummeted again. Subsequently, although the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Joint Control Committee in February of last year and the Silk Improvement Committee led by the National Economic Committee in February of this year have successively emerged, there have been no concrete achievements demonstrated until recently.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation of China's silk industry in recent years, we can say that it is in a continuous downward spiral. To reverse this downward trend, we believe that: first, we must actively start by improving silkworm varieties and improving production technology. Only with excellent technology and superior quality can we compete with foreign goods in the international silk market. Second, in terms of passive measures, we must not only expand overseas markets, but also seek to develop domestic sales on a large scale. Only with a developed domestic silk weaving industry can we consume a large amount of raw silk; only with a developed silk reeling industry can we consume a large amount of silkworm cocoons.</p>

<h3>A Type of Schoolwork: Knowledge of Military Training</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>If you were to go to the front of the Japanese barracks in Hongkou these past few days, you would probably always see dozens of Japanese soldiers wearing chest protectors, helmets, and holding round-tipped rifles, practicing [bayonet drills] - a type of killing technique - under the blazing sun. Are they occupying us, or are we occupying them?</p>
<p>This year, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to all secondary and higher schools across the country, requiring student soldiers to undergo three weeks of extremely rigorous military training during this summer vacation. Although the timing seems to have already been missed, it is still a [belated remedy]: this is what is meant by [ten years of training]. My diary has therefore been filled with countless valuable materials. Now I will make this material public.</p>
<p>Training began on July 1st and ended on the 21st. The barracks were borrowed from our school. Our life was completely militarized, with [obedience] as the primary duty: unlike the previous military training, which only involved wearing uniforms for drills, the two are not comparable. We were urged to get up by the reveille at four o'clock in the morning, and had to complete dressing, making the bed, and washing up within twenty minutes: then we went to the drill ground for roll call. From 4:30 to 5:00, we did flexibility exercises for half an hour. From 5:00 onwards, it was technical training, with special emphasis on squad drills. Breakfast was at 6:30. From 7:30 to</p>
