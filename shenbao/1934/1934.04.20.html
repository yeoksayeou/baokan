<h3 id="c14">軍備競爭中之難題貞 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>軍備縮小。近又成爲歐洲當前之巨大問題。英國軍縮提案。表面似爲各國所贊同。然觀法蘭西致英政府公文。卽可窺見其隱含有極端相反之意味。其所認爲嚴重者。一則爲德國自行擴張軍備。二則爲法國自身之安全保障。夫德國退出軍縮會議及國際聯盟後。卽高唱充實國防之主張。其一九三四至一九三五年之海陸空軍國防預。總計爲七萬零二百七十四萬二千馬克。與去年度相較。約增加一萬五千萬馬克。其航空部預算總額。爲一萬九千零四十七萬六千馬克。與當世諸强國相較。其數固甚微小。然就法國之觀察。已不能不痛感威脅。認爲法國國防之安全保障。有受震撼之虞。故再三以安全保障爲念。且法國之所謂保障。不僅在已國國防之充實。尤注意於英國之切實援助。并利用軍縮會議爲之後援。務使德意志在列國共同恊約監視之下。不能有任何反抗之舉。并冀此舉之能無期延長也。</p>
<p>歐洲大戰後。此種策略。已維持十六年。德國反抗之情緒及其國内之形勢已不堪再行忍受。是以希特拉振臂一呼。響應四起。第三帝國精神。乃遍及於德人。法國於此種德國内在精神。固無法壓迫。祗有時時緊急戒備耳。假使德國復於短時期内。編成巨大而有力之兵隊。則法國將運用外交。發動國際的共同戰線以對德。是其送致英國軍縮公文中力述德國增加軍事預算不合理之徵意也。同時法國財政困難。因維持金本位制而愈甚本年度預算不足且達十八萬萬法郎。而於純粹消費之軍備預算。則未能稍滅。是以不得不多方運用國聯。務使爲範圍德意志之國際聯合戰線。并以維護法蘭西之安全保障爲歸宿。</p>
<p>殊不知今日之國聯。已不復有曩昔尊嚴。德人對之。已甚漠視。其所以墜失信用之原因。第一。爲國際外交已返還一九一四年以前之從橫狀勢。大都着重於各個聯合之秘密策略。會議塲上之運用。殆成過去。且撑持國聯之大國。僅有英法。而英國對限制德國之本意。又與法國根本不同。第二·意大雖未完全脫離國聯。其反對之企圖。殊爲明顯。并連絡奥匈。另成一國際體系。此體系與德國雖無絲毫利益。而於國聯。則具相當巨大之妨碍。尤足給法國之安全保障以當頭棒喝。第三·各小國原爲法國之衛星。亦卽制限德國四境有力之工具。近自多腦河流域小恊約國。漸自成一體系後。將不受法國之指揮而獨立。是於國聯與軍縮。皆有不利。至於比利時、及丹麥。西班牙、諸國。促進軍縮與補充安全保障之要求。僅能在輿論上有若干之聲援。於實際問題。則初無所損益也。</p>
<p>當此之時。法國最有力之企劃。厥爲邀請蘇聯加入國際聯盟。以增厚其聲勢。同時撤去德國在政治外交上經濟上之後援。在以往時期中。蘇聯固甚不願抛棄其革命的傳統政策。以與法國週旋。現在德意志旣趨向於絕對的國家主義。蘇聯社會主義建設。在某種形勢下。突感重大不便。故須在歐洲另闢外交出路。同時遠東方面如北滿邊境各地。到處現露軍事上之危機。設使西部國境線。不能確保平安。則蘇聯不免陷於危境。於是法蘇關係。乃愈見接近。而蘇聯加入國聯之說。遂成爲日内瓦外交之新題目矣。</p>
<p>總之。維持現狀與打破現狀兩種勢力之鬭爭。因國聯之無力而愈激劇。因軍縮之殭化而愈尖銳。但當世諸國。又莫不擴大其國家主義之支配範圍。積極從事於軍事上之整備。而各國皆不易得眞正聯盟之與國。苟不得與國之切實助力。又不敢貿然挑戰。是以對立殭持之局。仍然籠罩全歐耳。</p>

<p>法國政储接收英國問題之後、旋於四月六日以口頭照會致送英國政府、就英國所問各節、簡略答復、昨日下午又備正式公文、說明法國之見地、實則四月六日法國致送口頭照會之後、與昨日致送正式公文之前、英政府又曾照會法國政府、提出兩項問題、此項照會係於四月十日由英外部交與法國駐英大使戈爾平、請其轉達者、其内容包含兩項問題、</p>
<p>（一）關於軍縮公約實施上保障如有成立恊定之可能時、法國政府對英國本年一月三十一日之軍縮備忘錄、是否凖備接受、（按一月三十一日英國備忘錄大意、謂歐洲各國須就下列兩途、選擇其一、卽（一）商訂公約、使軍備最雄厚之國家、廢棄某某種類軍器、（二）軍備最雄厚之國家、如不能照第一項辦理、卽須以現有軍備爲基礎訂立公約、限制不再增加、但英國政府欲積極進行第一項辦法）</p>
<p>（二）法國如對第一問題作肯定之答復、則請精切說明、法國對軍縮公約之實施、究希望採取何種保障、</p>
<p>英國照會最後請求法國迅速答復、法外長於收到此項照會之後、乃督率外交部人員草擬正式公文、交行政上及軍事上有聲望之專家加以審查、隨卽於昨日下午送交英國政府、卽本社昨電所報吿之内容也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）政府各要員今晨在掌壐大臣艾登之辦公室、密商法國拒絕英國軍縮方案之牒文、蓋艾登近若干時内曾爲英國軍縮方案之「攬售員」也、</p>
<p>法國牒文乃答覆四月十日英國之照會者、英國照會中詢問（一）法國願否凖備接受按照德總理希特勒向艾登所提建議修正之英國備忘錄、爲軍縮公約之根據（二）果願接受、則法國須需何種保障、</p>
<p>法國之覆文、請英國注意德國增加陸海空軍預算三五二·○○○·○○○馬克一事、謂此足證德政府違反條約、以種種方式推准重整軍備、至其所以爲適當程度之一種决心、德國隣邦不能漠視臨頭之危害、尤其爲不設軍備區域内近已違反條約設備許多飛行塲、同時德政府寗願完成其半軍事性質之組織、以供戰爭之用、而不願予以裁廢、或改供民事用途、此種非常嚴重之行爲、足以證明德政府在有意無意間已使談判爲不可能、蓋談判之基礎、已爲德國之發端破壞無餘也、</p>
<p>故今日在討論能否依一種履行保障之方式商得妥恊、而足使簽字公約諸國認德國重整軍備爲合法問題以前、法國必須將其對於自己安全條件之憂慮、置於前列、文中繼謂德國復回國聯、實足打銷此種憂慮、末稱、前爲實現履行保障之滿意方式計、曾以德國重蒞日内瓦、爲同樣必要條件、艾登勳爵此次赴德、對此重要點、並未携回良好之解决、今日之希望似未聊勝於前云云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國對於軍縮問題之態度、始終如一、此爲吾人讀悉法國致英復文後得到之結論、德國欲支出軍費二十萬萬馬克、其對英政府說明之理由、法國亦認爲不充足、法國政府因此認德國之增加軍備爲秘密行動、拒絕正式承認、當德國一意重整軍備之時、法國惟有將關於軍縮問題之討論、重行挽至正當計畫之上、易詞言之、卽重在軍縮會議與國聯會範圍之内、討論軍縮是也、由是德國重回日内瓦一層、實有重大意義、因德國當局之有無善意與是否誠懇、皆將於德國重回日内瓦與否占之矣、法國公文、在英國必首先引起反響、但一般人希望英國輿論對於法國所作决定之理由、必能了解、而於英法兩國之必須同意、亦能感覺及之、至德國方面讀悉法國公文之後、當能明瞭含混不淸之政策、現在業已結束、而光明正大態度或爲成功之要訣、法國公文對小恊商各國及波蘭、則定能與以興奮、此外法國政府採取此項决定、乃深知其嚴重性、且深悉其所能發生之影響、自信如此行動、實所以謀國家之福利云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）威廉街今日發出官塲文吿、謂英意德三國皆循直接與積極之途徑進行軍縮政策、法國所稱德國已破壞公約之說、顯爲一種策略上行動、和約載有關於軍備許多可能性、德國並未用之、如和約允許抵補廢艦、卽其一也、德國已毁除其重砲與潛艇、但法國則砲位日多、艦隊屢增、試問對誰而作乎云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）列强之一、今第一次明白發表其意見、世界各國有節制軍縮希望、似已化爲黯淡、一般人士視法國軍縮牒文爲明白堅决拒絕英相麥唐納提出之方案、法國對德國適合實際的重整軍備、今切實聲明今對軍縮虚事委蛇、無益於事、故衆覺艾登所提議軍縮會主幹部應於四月三十日召集之建議、已無效可言、惟總委員會則應儘速開會、又信德國對法國牒文之反響、似必嚴峻、蓋列强之一今第一次明白發言、已將現局之責任加諸德國之肩故也、惟一般人士仍覺法國之牒文尚未封閉諒解之門户、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國勞工日報稱、變更軍縮現狀、其權仍操諸英國、德國軍事預算之足以危害安全、不獨對于巴黎人士如是、卽對于倫敦人士、亦何獨不然云、巴黎畫報稱、如倫敦聲稱法國被攻擊時、英國願爲法助、則危局自不致發生云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）除載有國際軍縮備忘錄之白皮書發表外、今日官塲未表示其對於時局之意見、倫敦報紙已移其對於預算案之注意、而轉集於軍縮之僵局、一般輿情皆以爲法國來牒如無轉　餘地、則軍縮不復實騐政治、每日電聞稱、法國對於德國要求之態度、誠爲倡含法言論者之態度、但在最後辦法中之合法主義、僅可以戰爭厲行之耳、晨郵報與每日郵報皆歡迎新發展、並勸英國立卽增厚其國防力、泰晤士報稱、如謂德國理論爲不合情理實不可能、蓋攻略戰具與守衛戰具兩種之區别、載見軍縮草約、今未有證據可斷定德國現所爲者、超過此適當範圍也云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）德報對法國致英之軍縮照會抨擊甚厲、如柏林日報載稱、法國照會並未載有世人喁喁期望之和洽　表示、實爲喊事、英國方面今日公布之白皮書、其用意欲向英國會及輿論界證明英國苦心挽救軍縮、實非無的放矢也、於此可知英德意對軍縮問題之政策始終一貫、而法國則在掩耳盜鈴而已、更據半官性質之外交評論載稱、法國照會意在避重就輕、揭示安全保障之支節問題、而使軍備充實國裁軍及實踐對德軍備平等諾言之世界中心問題、束之高閣云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國各報評論法國致英復文、謂其用阘延宕時日、並謂法國復文、拒絕德國重整軍備、從此直接談判似已結束、半官式政治通信報謂法國在復文中、不復談及裁軍、對於英國在安全問題上所作讓步、亦未顧及、可見法國已違反軍縮會議所依據之原則、並已違反凡爾賽和約矣、至於英意德三國則始終推行裁軍政策、此於英國所發表之白皮書卽可見之云云、（按英國政府將自掌璽大臣艾登歷聘大陸各國以來、英法德意四國所交換之文件以白皮書形式發表、）</p>

<p>羅馬法國答復英國牒文發表之後、意大利方面則露驚異之色、此間人士向以爲英國對于軍縮公約實施上保障之意見、漸次演變、可使法國採取較爲妥恊之態度、然就近日情形觀之、則持此樂觀態度者、應當審愼處之矣、意大利日報之評論曰、「此項牒文在法國外交政策上殆爲一意外之劇變」講壇報謂、「近來雙方不復堅持不讓之態度、已在軍縮會陣綫上爲之打破矣、各國軍備競賽之門又復開啓矣、至在吾儕意大利人、則法國之牒文似可心鉅大之利益、卽所以澄淸軍縮問題也」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>米蘭諾意國報紙一致抨擊法國致英之軍縮照會、例如意大利民報載稱、法照會不過爲使英國放棄其要求法國裁軍之一種策略、此言如不中的、則吾人不得不信法國願負軍備競爭之責也、（十九日國民社電）</p>

<p>不久在蘇聯京城、曾有一次非常奇異的祝典、一批蘇聯的航空員、恭賀他們的一個同事、他航行總程、已足繞地球二十五週、這個航行家、已飛過一百萬公里（基羅密特）載運郵件及貨物、未遭一次嚴重的意外、這樣的飛行家、在蘇聯共有十個人、但是他們的名聲、只不過極少數人知道、惟有飛行幾千公里而打破紀錄者、才得立卽揚名於國内外、而在日常工作中飛行幾十萬公里的人、誰都不知道的、</p>
<p>但是這種日常工作中、却充滿着眞正俠義小說的意味、譬如有一個航空員、曾在一架輕便的飛機上、並在四十冰度的氣候裏、飛過幾個北方貿易站、以求凖時運到國際毛皮商塲所需要的皮</p>
<p>料、幾百個航行員每天飛着、或者爲救濟冰圍着的汽船、或者爲運輸貨物給中亞西亞高山脈上的居民、或者爲巡視森林、或者爲運送郵件、或者爲消滅蝗虫及蚊虫、或者爲播種米麥及乾草、或者爲散播烟幕於田間、使不受凍、或者爲撲滅森林大火等等、這確是大有功於蘇聯航空事業的、</p>
<h3 id="c107">蘇聯航空事業的誔生 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>但在這樣有力發展之先、蘇聯航空、曾經過相當的階段、第一航綫（莫斯科到柏林共長一千五百公里）成立於一九二三年、近十年來、蘇聯的民用航空事業進步、眞如一日千里、如據航綫長度而論、現在雖佔世界第三位（在美法之後）、但據幾種特式航空而論、已佔首位、在第一個五年計劃之初、航空總長計有九·三二六公里、在此五年期内、航綫曾增加了二倍半、竟達三二·○○○公里、今年航綫長度又加上一二·○○○公里、此外蘇聯有一萬餘公里循環的郵政航綫、烏克蘭、北高加索、西部西比利亞、中亞細亞和其他蘇聯各區域、都滿佈着航綫來轉運郵件、和爲農作業指導等等、今年這些循環綫的長度、約增至二萬五千公里、</p>
<h3 id="c108">世界最長航綫之一 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯現有航綫中的幾條、如莫斯科·海參崴綫·及莫斯科-梯弗里斯－塌希坑特綫、要算在世界最長的航綫了現在轉運緊急的郵件貨物及身負要務的旅客等、航空都有極大的作用、一九三二年、航空運送三萬八千個旅客、七百噸的郵件、及二千噸的貨物、去年、這些數目又大大增加了、旅客增加到五萬五千人、物運增加了百分之一百七十、郵運增加了百分之三百八十五、今年蘇聯航運工作、與去年比較應當至少增加一倍、</p>
<h3 id="c109">飛過沙漠及冰凍 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>航空在人烟稀少及荒蕪的地域上、用途最大、在多沙漠及大山的中亞細亞、並在北極地帶、航空已成就了一種劃期的革命事業、在中亞細亞的幾處地方、居民完全不知什麽呌做塌車及汽車、但是很知道飛機、從前要化幾個月的光陰、才得從塌希坑特或沙漠爾坑特的城市、到中亞細亞遙遠的農村、現在、蘇聯的飛機、已把這些遠方的居民、與中部城市、在一二天内運絡起來了、</p>
<p>航空對於北極地帶、是有偉大意義的、蘇聯的航空家已與那邊遼遠的商站、也成立起經常的關係、北冰洋裏的蘇聯諸島、每年者有飛機光臨、去年、蘇聯飛機、曾六次飛到遠如佛郎格爾的海島、</p>
<p>在苛爾斯克探險隊服務的飛機、每年替國家節省幾百萬元的消費、因爲飛機能够替般隻指出「淸水」發現的地方、並能引導船隻航過冰塊、</p>

<p>蘇聯開始製造飛船、爲時還不很久、但是已經造成了幾只小飛船、（最大的有七千五百立方密達容量）、這些小飛船、祗是嘗試物、爲將來製造大飛船的先聲、同時蘇聯也就在製造訓練航行人材的練習艇、</p>
<p>蘇聯第一隻大小適中的飛船、快將完成了、同時已經開始建築另一隻含有嘗試性質的全金屬飛船、在第二次五年計劃裏、將擴大工程、來營造一小分隊的飛船、這一小隊、（將命名列寗隊）、</p>
<p>將有七艘大飛船、現在蘇聯人民爲建築這隊飛船起見、快將募捐二千五百萬盧布、又擬成立幾條飛船航綫、來連絡蘇聯中心城市與北極地帶、　　航空在農業中的效用</p>
<p>蘇聯的農業航空、據其工作的容積而論、亦佔世界第一位、這是沒有什麽奇怪的、因爲農業航空的發展條件、祗能在蘇聯產生、在一九三一年、農業航空、開始作飛播種的實騐、在這一年、祗種了四千海克泰、二年以後、這個數目已增加到十三萬八千洚克泰、一架飛機、每小時能播種二十海克泰、這就超過拖拉機的生產量九倍、除了播種用外蘇聯農業航空、還在消滅害虫方面、執行極大工作、去年、四十一萬五千海克泰的土地上、曾利用過航空的服務、在低濕之地、飛機可以賷灑石腦油、來消滅蚊虫、並可投擲别種材料、來消滅其他害虫、</p>
<p>農業航空、還有其他許多作用、卽如在冬天、在濃霜密佈的時候、惟有飛機才得造出不透霜的烟幕、飛機又能巡視森林、防禦火災、攝取森林面積的影片、消滅荒野草木等、</p>
<h3 id="c111">蘇聯民用航空世界第一 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>在天空攝影方面、蘇聯民用航空、已爲世界第一、去年曾從天空攝去千柯次克半島及萊娜河底三角口的影片、這樣規模的民用航空、假使沒有本國的航空工業、那末在這樣短促的時期内是不可能的、蘇聯科學的航空組織、在悉心規劃、已有極大的成績了、蘇聯所有各航綫、現在都用國產的飛機、但在三四年前、大半飛機都是外國的製造的、蘇聯的飛機質量、現在不亞於外國的飛機、並且有幾種樣式的飛機還在外國之上、蘇聯在製造全金屬的飛機方面、却是個先鋒者、並且執世界的牛耳、</p>
<p>飛機馬達的製造、是飛機製造工業的最重要一個部門、在這方面、蘇聯也已得有偉大的成功、在九三○年、祇有百份之十二的飛機、曾用蘇聯的馬達、俱是現在的、在百份之九十的航空馬達上、都刻有蘇聯製造」的字樣了、（完）</p>

<p>太平洋險惡的暗雲、似乎有暫時消去的可能、而遠東的一角、由黑龍江上遊以至同江口、沿烏蘇里江一帶、都遍佈陰霾的氣象、大家都有點感覺着不久的將來、會發生重大而可慮的事變、特别是日本軍隊、這次換防的舉動、更刺激了蘇聯當局的神經、據這裏所得到的情報、日本軍隊兩個師團的更調、决不是單獨的換防性質、她有兩種很嚴重的意義、第一是要乘勢攻擊西比利亞、擴展他的勢力、第二是要找機會侵入内蒙古、伸手於新疆、實行他大陸政策的第二步、所以此次調到滿洲的交代兵、是京都與名古屋兩個極大的師團、因爲北滿方面、交通未曾十分發達、以步砲兵見長的姬路第十師團、祗可以應付軍械缺乏的義勇軍、請到國際的戰鬥、要和赤軍較短長、那還不够、名古屋師團·附得有坦克車聯隊全部、與飛機二百餘架、這些部隊、都在黑龍江、哈爾濱、海林等地集中、目下雖然還沒有佈置完備、可是很積極、</p>
<p>以維持國土·建設社會主義國家爲職志的蘇聯、當然絕不肯忽視這種軍事行動、尤不肯隨便放鬆他自己的軍事防禦工作、在蘇聯的一般狀態、普通人是沒有法子知道軍事情形、并且也絕對不許外人知道、不過僅就我眼睛所能看到和一般可得而知道的、作個簡單的報吿、現在沿滿洲境界綫、到底駐有多少兵、其部隊的兵種何如、除非是高級負責的蘇聯將領纔明白、我們的佔計、與一般的觀察、都、都以爲最多不過二十萬、最少也有十四萬、而其中包含的兵種、却非常複雜、有任突擊的步兵、有精悍的騎兵、有巨大的飛機隊、飛機數至少有三百架、還有化學戰隊與機械化兵團等、海參崴附近的一個飛行塲、特别宏大、收容的飛機、也格外多、其飛機的續航力也很强、飛往長春、奉天的來回、當然不成問題、卽來回於東京大阪、也不是怎樣困難、</p>
<p>海參崴這個港·是商港的性質大過軍港、實際上也沒有什魔了不得的設備、據記者看來、是不容易抵抗日本優勢海軍的、不過他們對於海防、還是十分注意、現時正在修築堅固的城塞、同時在魯斯基島上、駐了十二艘潛水艇、事實上維護海參崴的、恐后還是空軍和陸軍、</p>
<p>照這種情勢看、蘇日之間的戰爭、眞有一觸卽發之勢、且這兩國在歷史上又是敵國、一般人民的情感上·和現行政體上·都融閡得很厲害、最後一刻、總是不可避免的、所以們都在從事於積極的防禦工作、都在調兵遣將、</p>
<p>不過現在的問題、是蘇聯方面、决不至於越境挑戰、更不會轉而採取軍事上的攻勢、以招致他本身建設上的巨大不利、假使日本帝國忽然發狂、攻進西比利亞·或攻沿海省、那就會挑發禍變了、但是日本不特在普通社會中、包含着不可消除的矛盾、卽其軍隊中、也有很多的危險分子·在那裏起會發酵作用、尤其駐在北滿的軍隊、更多赤色的感染、再則滿洲的反日運動、表面上雖已潛伏下去、暗地裏却更見堅實有力、足使日本帝國不得安心、所以最近期間、他又有緩和的表示、其唯一的象徵、就是對中東路問題、表示接受蘇聯的提議、不久卽將再開會議、議定售價等問題、會議前途、雖未必卽可樂觀、而事勢的催迫、却不能不令日本稍事後退、然而這究竟祗是一時的現象、戰事的原素、終於存在着、（一九三四年四月十日）</p>

<p>中央社云、歐亞航空公司計畫舉辦之平陜粤陜兩新綫、設備久已就緒、原訂一月間卽可開航、嗣因廣州軍用機塲、不能借</p>
<p>用、致須另闢民用機塲、以致延擱、近聞該公司已商借石牌跑馬塲爲機塲、工程將近完竣、開航在卽、記者特於昨日訪詢該公司總經理、據</p>
<p>李景樅君談稱本公司前因新疆當局約定、最遲本年一月、可以使公司飛機復航迪化、以爲國際聯運、届時凖可實現、爲謀平津粤港間同時亦可以直接享受歐亞兩洲間之航空郵遞便利起見、曾擬另闢平陜粤陜兩新航綫、并訂於一月間與新疆航綫復航時、一同開航、使其與滬新綫交會於西安、以便往來遞運平津滬漢粤港曁其他各地與歐洲間之國際航空郵件、及國内郵件、嗣因新疆當局、以軍事未定、一再阻止復航、而粤陜綫内之廣州機塲、亦生問題、遂至延未開航、現在廣州機塲、雖已另覓築妥、但新疆復航、則短期内尚難實現、公司方面、因粤陜平陜兩綫之沿途設備、均已籌設就緒、爲擬利用此設備、以謀平粤間之交通、使之益臻迅速起見、遂决將平陜粤陜之繞道飛行、改爲平粤之直綫通航、藉以縮短航程、便利行旅、此項計劃、刻已呈奉交通部核准、所謂</p>
<p>平粤直綫通航係將原定粤陜綫之由廣州·經長沙·漢口·襄陽·至西安、改爲不經襄陽至西安、而由漢口直達洛陽、及原定之平陜綫之由北平經太原·至西安·改爲不經太原至西安、而由太原直達洛陽、在洛陽聯運、形成一平粤直綫通航、如此不特平粤間之航程、縮至極短、且可以使航時减少、運費减低、</p>
<p>五月一日開航現平粤綫内各航站之設備、雖已籌設就緖、公司爲策萬全起見、對於各站之設備情形、擬作再度之視察、茲已决定派工程師何恩、於本星期内、駕機前往全綫、重行視察、並已决定於五月一日正式通航、且已正式通知郵政總局及各航站寄郵載客矣、</p>
<p>南下北上班期平粤綫之航行班期、定爲每星期來往各二次、南下機每逢星期二及星期四上午八時、由北平起飛、午後二時抵洛陽過宿、次晨上午九時、再由洛陽起飛、同日午後六時十五分到廣州、北上機、每逢星期二及星期四上午七時、由廣州起飛、同日午後四時十分抵洛陽過宿、次晨上午八時、再由洛陽起飛、同日午後二時到達北平、同時并可在洛陽與滬新綫之西安蘭州或南京上海各航站聯運、以前之由廣州至北平太原洛陽西安蘭州漢口長沙等處、動需旬日上下者、現在只須一日又半、卽可到達矣、</p>
<p>規定航程票價按照公司測定之空中航程、計北平至太原爲四百五十公里、太原至洛陽三百五十公里、洛陽至漢口五百公里、漢口至長沙三百公里、長沙至廣州六百公里、合成平粤全綫航程二千二百公里、乘客票價、北平至太原定爲六十元、太原至洛陽四十元、洛陽至漢口五十元、漢口至長沙五十元、長沙至廣州一百五十元、合成平粤全綫航行票價三百五十元、其票價比較滬新綫内、低廉殊甚、因滬新綫内、西安以西各站所用之汽油價値、恒超過平粤綫内三倍以上、成本實不相同云、</p>
<p>將改用大飛機復據李總經理稱、平粤綫内、暫時係用現有之五百七十五馬力之容克斯Ｗ字第三十四號式飛機飛行、故由廣州至北平、暫須一日半、之航程、公司爲謀平粤間之飛行、更加迅速起見、已在德國另訂容克斯Ｊ字五十二號式大飛機一架、至遲三個月内、卽可驶至中國、駛至後、卽可改用此種飛機飛行、查此機在我國尚未之前覩、上裝有七百馬力之發動機三座、合成二千一百馬力、全機本身之重爲五千四百公斤、另有載重量三千八百公斤、可載乘客三十人、坐位異常舒適、航行速度、每小時二百三十公里、耐航可至一千四百餘公里、此機到後、則平粤之間、可以一</p>

<p>（十一）「能動的意識看指導的作用」解何作？（二十六頁十二行）</p>
<p>答··這是說，理論的範圍不單是記戰現有的事情」，「最緊要的還是變革世界」，「指導行動。」這一段是批判着火花派的錯誤，說他們雖則對於眼前發生着的鬥爭過程的記述努過力，但是他們對於指導行動的理論却是拙劣的。這一名話是指着俄國社會民主黨說。說黨能動的意識着指導的作用者，換句話說，「黨」不僅對於客觀的現實要有正確的把握，不僅對於當時正在發展中的俄國革命鬥爭過程作了一番分釋和記述就算完事，「黨」應能動（不是被動）的意識到在當前的客觀形勢的發展中了解自己的指導作用，卽一絲不肯放鬆客觀的形勢，最最堅决的去開展這種形勢，收有利於己的條件愈加擴大，收不利於己的條件無情的克服，不是觀望形勢，對客觀形勢作些抽象的分拆和說明。更進一步的說，就是要抓住一過程中的現實，意識的去引導另一新的階段的到來，不是機械的或機會主義的迎合客觀的開展的意思。這番解釋不知你完全了解否？現在再舉一個例子，帮助你了解這個。</p>
<p>譬如，中國目前民族的危機是人人知道的。前的形勢是怎樣呢？國際帝國主義有打破九國公約，由維持中國領土完整的形勢而進入承認「僞國」，派分中國的可能。自然，這對於中國是不利的。但是，一個政黨對於當前的形勢應取如何的態度呢？僅僅對這形勢作一些不拆和說明是不够的。也不能僅是大聲疾呼，悲歌憤暴一回卽可完事。它應利用造成最近國際形勢的各帝國主義間的矛盾，沉潛的，堅决的去破壞帝國主義間進攻中國的一致的條件，將這不利的條件轉變而爲與自己有利的，由此，而引導出一新的形勢，使這種瓜分陰謀成爲不可能。但是，這不是抽象分拆與推測的問題，而是自己主動的，並且意識的，明了自己領導的作用，及負担這一領導的决心、有一句名言，說歷史是由人類自己造成的。」不錯，每一歷史階段上的一切的事實，是客觀的在發展，同時人重也可意識的改變它。中國目前民族的危機固然嚴重，這不是說中國民族就沒有出路了。此意諒你也能瞭解罷！</p>
<p>（十二）何謂「唯物史觀」？</p>
<p>答；「唯物史觀」英名是（Ｍａｔｅｒｉｎｌｉ　ｔｉｃ　Ｃｏｎｃｅｐｔｉｏｎ　ｏｆ　ｈｉｓｔｏｒｙ）或名「史的唯物論「歷史　唯物論」。（Ｈｉｓｔｏｒｉｅａｌ　Ｍａｔｅｒｉａｌｉ　ｍ唯物辯證</p>
<p>法是一個總的方法論，可應用於宇宙間一切現象。唯物史觀則爲唯物辯證法在解釋社會現象上之應用。故唯物辯證法是一般的，而唯特史觀則爲特殊的。社會是客觀存在的特殊的形式，所以它是有自己客觀的特殊的發展規律的。社會的特殊的發展規律是··生活資料之生產和生產的物品之交換關係爲一切的社會組織的基礎；一切的社會變革與一切政治革命，其根本原因並不是由於人類對於正義或眞理之理解乃是生產與交換不斷的改革之結果。所以社會發展的原動力，是生產力之變動。生產力常在一定的生產關係下發生它的作用，而社會經濟結構，社會生活底基礎，又是由這些生產關係所搆成。其他一切社會生活都是建築在這個基礎之上，故稱謂「上層建築」如政治法律，宗敎，道德，政治等等都是。生產關係爲求適合於生產力的發展之故，時時刻刻的在變動着它的内容，但當生產力底發展到了某種程度時，常時的生產關係不能與它相適合時，於是這兩者遂發生衝突，於是就發生社會革命，將舊的生產關係破壞，新的生產關係建立。而一切舊的上層建築，因爲基礎已倒，遂也或遲或早地變遷了。照社會的經濟結構的特殊發展規則來畫了，歷史上可分爲民族社會，封建社會，資本主義社會，社會主義社會，</p>
<p>（十三）「他們不疑惑蘇聯離開他們的意識的意識獨立的客觀的存在着，他們深信在日常的實踐上，蘇聯現實的存在着，普羅列塔里亞爲社會主義而行的鬥爭現實的存在着」這幾句話太深刻，請淺釋一下。（四十九頁十行十一行）</p>
<p>（十五）「他們並沒有想把社會當作離開人類意志而獨立的物質過程去考慮」其意義不甚明白。（五十頁五行）</p>
<p>（十六）「使他們知道資本主義社會是客觀的物質過程」其意義不甚明白。（五十一頁六行）</p>
<p>答；這三個問題的性質都差不多，大槪許君對於唯物論的根本槪念尚不淸白，故而發生這些問題。在答覆第九問裏，我們把唯物論的根本觀念已經說了一些，許君看了之後或許可以明白了罷。卽唯物論者認爲宇宙是由許多物質構成的，這些東西是離吾人而獨立存在的。第十三問「蘇聯是獨立的存在着」，其意思就是說這個初期社會主義國家，在世界上是確有其物，並不是「他們」的幻想。第十五問是說一人民派」的錯誤，他們錯誤的原因，就是陷於唯心論者的見解，否認在客觀世界上社會是獨立的存在着，卽你所摘下來的那句話。第十六問也是一樣的。你所摘的一句的那一段話的意思是說··在階級鬥爭過程中，無產階級逐漸知道資本主義社會並不是某一部分人的幻想，也不是一種學說，在客觀世界上是確有其物的。</p>
<p>（十四）何謂「勢動階級」？（四十九頁十三行）</p>
<p>答··「勢」字排錯了，應該是「勞」字。</p>
<p>我們看了許君讀這書發生如許疑問，覺得你現在還不宣讀此書。但是辯證唯物論是我們應當並道的，决不可因噎廢食，故希望你改讀「現代世界觀」。又，有許多名詞不　可翻閱字典，如新哲學辭典，現代語辭典之類。以上的答案也大都是節述那些字典的。</p>

<h3 id="c219">英國中等敎育之現狀（中）（五）考試 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 朱鎭葇</p>
<p>每個英國中學生入學的目的不在畢業、乃在畢業考試及格、這種考試、不是由本學校當局主持、乃是由校外的機關（多半是大學）所主持的這種基本考試名爲普通的學校考試、它與各國的大學的入學考試一樣的困難、</p>
<p>六歲時應倫敦大學的普通學校考試的、每個學生如果對於五種指定之科目考試及格、則可獲得考取的證書、這種證書由敎育部保存、作爲學生入大學的資格、或由其他各種職業收受下來、以替代他們所要舉行的職業考試、此外、學生如欲入銀行、保險公司、或其他商業界服務時、這種證書亦是一種要素、所以、每個學生在未出校以前部都是努力設法、獲得此種證書的、</p>
<p>（六）學額</p>
<p>在倫敦每個中學所招收學生的人數平均、約爲四百二十五人、沒有一個中學招收過一千名的、雖然曾有一個中學招收過九百名、他們招收學生的標凖名額爲四百五十名、倘使超過此數、則學校當局認爲敎育中之要素—個别指導—乃失其效力、每個學校當局者認爲敎師應躬親個别指導每個學生、同時師生中應養成一種友誼的態度和繼不斷互相討論的精神、這是英國中學敎育中之特點、</p>
<p>在英國的敎育中、社交的關係與個人的接觸認爲特别的重要、英國的學生不僅在課室中的限制有所規定、卽在集餐方面亦有規定的、例如、在劍橋與牛津兩大學中、所有的學生每天至少要集餐一次、有的大學甚至兩餐、任何學生可以不在校住宿、早晚餐亦可聽其自便、但午餐非在</p>
<p>校同食不可、所有的英國中學校都有優美的膳廳的設備、專作學生午餐集餐之用的、有的學生午餐是由家中帶到校的、碗碟用具學校有出租、學生只要出幾辦士租錢就可、其他學生的午餐是由校中供給、餐中的菜目有猪肉·麵包·牛油·牛乳·茶和水果、每客約售九辦士在中心學校中每客只售七辦士、</p>
<p>（七）學校曆</p>
<p>在倫敦的一般小學校每年上課的日期的數目約有四十四星期、但中學的上課日期只規定三十九星期、道三十九星期分爲三季、每季三星期、至於其他的假期都由每個學校的校長自由支配、别人不得干涉、最可笑的一點就是中央敎育當局對於各中學内的春假或其他假期的日期和假期的長短往往糢糊不知、因爲各個中學的假期者是不一律的、</p>

<p>— 清德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因此在這個短短的幾分鐘裏，這一列升火待發的御用火車上，雖然烟囱裏同樣的在冒着黑烟，氣鍋裏也同樣的蓄滿着蒸氣，但是竟沒有一個人在車上照料；一直到太后在伊自已的車廂裏坐定之後，這些火夫司機們，才得從地上爬起來，回到他們的固定的職位上去，等待開車的命令。</p>
<p>當我們在凖備出發前的二十幾天裏，正不知道發生了多少的困難，累得那慶善差不多已是心力交瘁了！第一個困難問題，就是車上的一班工役··因爲太后堅執着要呌那些太監們</p>
<p>去担任行車的事務，但是這可怎麽行呢？雖然那些太監們大半已在宫内執役多年，儘可以勝任普通人家的男管家或侍婢的職務，然而他們從不曾受過一些起碼的鐵道常識，呌他們如何行車呢？</p>
<p>慶善費了許多的唇舌，好容易才消了伊這個成見；但是伊最後還切實的叮嚀，無論如何，不准那些鐵路工役走進伊的視綫以内來。表示伊依舊還遵守着不用男人來服侍伊的古！</p>
<p>訓。</p>
<p>這個問題就算這樣解决了，可是其他的事情，却不能這樣容易。其中有一件是最可發笑的，就是太后堅决的命令慶善要敎他把那一列車上的全體工役，從司機一直到最低級的打掃夫，一齊穿起朝靴，戴起朝帽，打扮成十足的太監式。（一五）</p>

<p>在電影未映以前的一點時間，電影院裏卻顯示出一種特别的社會相。爲了一點小的爭執，就兩不相讓的爭吵起來，像是中國的人民非常的有振作，絕對忍耐不住一點欺侮。這次，一個學生爲了一個座位部題，向着一個穿了製服的兵士，果然又吵起來了。這個學生說··這是我坐的座位。</p>
<p>那個兵士說··你有什麽證明？</p>
<p>於是，兩方面的臉上，漸漸的露出一種難看的臉色。電影院裏的空氣突然緊張起來，人們也一個個的站起來看熱閙。那個學生固然想借此當着大衆出其十足的風頭，那個兵士當然也不願在許多人面前表示自己是一個弱者而這樣的下台。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，突然有一個聲音··　　「弗要吵哉！阿是中國人？」</p>
<p>工驚奇的回過頭來，郤是一個小孩子說的，手裏還玩着橘子皮。</p>
<p>不知他們不了解這句話呢，還是不屑聽這個小孩子的敎訓呢，竟然不以爲意的反動起武來了。</p>
<p>那個小孩子又呌着··「留些力量打東洋人吧。」</p>
<p>然而，他們還是不理。</p>
<p>我想着好笑，他們竟受小孩子嘲笑得這個樣子還不知羞。</p>
<p>大約後來由幾個黑衣警察跑來解决了。</p>

<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>這確乎是大殺風景的事，然而在缺乏公德心的國人，却視爲無足重輕，因此就造成外人「華人與狗」的同等待遇！</p>
<p>在這幾天的蘇州虎邱，很像是妙齡女郎，換上了燦爛新裝··桃花紅得像錦霞一般，柔綠的柳條，織着可愛的綠油簾幕，芳草地上，也已新綠如茵，隨地隨處，都充滿着醉人的誘惑力。於日一班遊春男女，也紛至沓來，實行踏靑。但這班雅人，在暢遊名勝之際，對於那迎人欲笑的紅桃綠柳，還要實行「花開堪折實須折」的詩中雅事，山花滿握，做春遊的特别標幟。後之來者，對那攀殘零落的花木，祇有望那「禁止攀折花木」的木牌，浩然長嘆！</p>
<p>閶門外小河沿的張家花園，是張祥豐糖果店主人的私園，佔地約六十畝。園中除了廳，堂，假山，池沼等等外，更種植着各種菓樹；别有一種漠漠平林的詩意。在蘇州園林中，另佔一種勝槪，張家主人，對於遊客，原係公開招待，任人觀覽，這原是園主不自私的美意，可是近來幾天，竟有一班遊客，將園中廳堂上的名人書畫，骨董玩器，實行攫奪主義，完全偷去，張家受此損失，祗得對於那班不入上流的遊客，一槪關門謝絕。</p>
<p>這種殺風景的事，在一班雅人看來，或者以爲是小德出入，無關宏旨；然而中國人的等於畜類，却就在這可以出入的小德上面！</p>
<h3 id="c223">俗語說：「一個和尚挑水吃，兩個和尚扛水吃，三個和尚嘸水吃。」一般人是偷安苟閒的，可是我們不應該諉卸責任！克苦，耐勞，治事要勤奮與負責，乃能成功偉大的事業。 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>

<p>……？」</p>
<p>一個老嫗喃喃自語道··「二百文醬油，只吃四十天就光了，一百五十文白菜，只能炒兩小碗，唉，日子眞難過呵！</p>

<p>一個富家女子說··「剛到ＸＸ公司買些用品，帶去二百塊錢還不够，哈，我這一星期，只用去五百塊不到，比上次節省多了。」</p>

<p>所以他情不自禁的，只管在路上走來走去。桂枝看他那番情形，料着他心裏是很委屈的。本來想用話來安慰他兩句，然而這就透着自己與他用情未斷，因之自己就笑着道··二爺，明天見，明天跟您拜年。說着微微一笑。積之這才醒悟過來，本待用話來答覆他的，似乎他有心規避，只在他兩眼眯着微微一笑的當中，人就走遠了。積之向那門裏望時，看到他那身腰雖是很强壯，還不失一種婀娜的樣子。心想這種人才，雖是出於舊家庭，能吃苦耐勞，同丈夫合作。而且把他領上新的路上走，他一樣的了解，若要說摩登女子，這才算是摩登女子。然而現在的人，把摩登二字，當作了浮華妖艶，有誰能賞識這樣的人才呢？只有我賞識，然而我却不能娶他。積之在趙家門外呆呆的向裏面望了一陣，再歎兩口氣，也就回去了。積之所以脫離這個家庭，只因爲兄嫂看不起他，對他加一種壓迫，他爲了洗刷自己的人格，不得不出去奮鬥，至於感情方面，並不仇恨他哥哥。好在自己已經有職業了縱然過去受着兄長拿職業來壓迫，然而這是過去的事了，也沒有仇恨之必要。加之厚之病的時候，積之又曾回來伺候哥哥的病，爲了這一點，厚之很受感動，所以在過陰歷年以前，却寫了好幾封信給積之，要他務必回來過年。積之若是不回來，倒顯着有裂痕，所以在除夕前一日就回海甸了。當桂枝看到他的時候，他已經在自己大門外瞭望過了若干回。</p>

<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>一人造兩種硯前人仿造古硯，每不僅造一種，如宋人劉羲叟，據歐譜說善造澄泥硯，而他書又稱劉羲叟造古瓦硯極佳，惟所出不多，士大夫家未能備有，又如明江西藩王，據唐氏硯說，善造未央瓦硯，而他書又稱藩王造銅雀硯，有秘術，腴潤發墨，得之者以爲奇寳，是可見藩王同時實仿製此兩種硯也。</p>
<p>余先父錦川公，遺一銅雀瓦硯，長約七寸，厚九分弱，質堅細，不渴墨，背粗布紋，有「建安十三年造」六隸字，筆法古勁，正面上端右有「水火之精相結成形」左有「英雄安在瓦爍猶存」十六隸字，中間兩邊，在「爲愛陶甄之質宜加卽墨之封」十二字，下面查考前人筆記，有「予得于漳河深淵以三十九枚易而加諸翰墨以爲博雅好藝之玩云洪武辛未重九躍仙識」三十六隸字，橫列十一行，每行三四字，但余硯下端以已殘破，截去四五分，故每行僅上一二字，如予漳深九而翰爲好藝辛未躍等字尚存，殊爲可惜，上載江西藩王所造之未央硯，有躍仙書三字，而此硯亦有躍仙題識，故疑此硯或亦卽爲藩王所造，但其眞正藩王所造的未央硯，余究未見過，則此硯是否爲藩王所造，或更有人輾轉仿製，亦無以證明之，將以待考古家之鑑定焉。</p>

<p>火　　　　　　形爲愛國　　　　英雄　　　　　　宜加　　之封</p>
<p>背面</p>
<p>附古磚除古瓦硯外，尚有古磚硯，僞品亦甚多，據一瓢集稱，古磚漢磚爲最堅，如建平磚哀帝時物，永建磚順帝時物，中平磚靈帝時物，皆色相温潤，蓋其時造磚，搏沙必歷數十日，和以松子脂，造法雖與澄泥硯稍異，而實質則大略相同，閱二千餘年而猶覺可愛，故古磚硯在康乾時代之硯癖家，多寳貴之，揚州阮元之八碍硯，最爲著名，中有黃龍元年磚硯，後爲淸道人所得，因名其齋爲黃龍硯齋，其寳愛可想。</p>

<h3 id="c227">紐約通信第一封紐約沒有春天？ <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 羅皚嵐</p>
<p>烈文兄：</p>
<p>來信囑爲貴刋寫點文章，說最好用通訊體裁，叙述旅美見聞，以餉國内讀者。在老哥的意思，或許以爲由我來談點遠隔重洋的事，不致誤觸甚麽「網」吧。但老哥那知我的苦處，如果我眞把許多見聞一一寫出來，那會要得罪許多人，打破許多在國内建築得好好的泥偶像，弄穿許多裱糊得好好的紙老虎，聰明如兄與我，這傻事是幹不得的。國人正把留學生當萬花筒，當西洋鏡，捧着看了又看，玩了又玩，我輩豈可做拆穿西洋鏡那種煞風景的事。</p>
<p>但老哥的盛意，又不能却。我離國五年了，因爲環境和個人的性情關係，很少提過筆，向國人饒舌。而今養老糧快完，不能不回國了，趁此餘暇，重振筆硯，回到我的筆墨生涯。現在快到春天了，旣然「莫談國事」，又不能談留學老爺們不紳士的言行，便談「紐約的春天」吧，這是屬於「今天天氣好，哈哈，」之類，想來不會開罪人的。</p>
<p>記得有一次在哥大「文學習作」的班上，一位敎授出了　一個題目，呌··「紐約的春天」。我當時寫了些甚麽，記不淸了，但記得開頭的一句是··「紐約沒有春天」。</p>
<p>那時我來紐約還不到一年，上課，上圖書館外，有時坐地　車去時規（Ｔｉｍｅｓ　Ｓｑｕａｒｅ）一帶看看戲，很少到别的地方去。見到的是高房子，街上往來匆匆的行人和汽車。白天很少機會直接看見太陽，晚上的月光則夢也夢不見。待上積滿了雪，人們忙着買聖誕禮物了，我知道那是冬天；白天的太陽　晒得出汗，有人帶草帽了，我知道那是夏天。至於春天，我實在不知道紐約有「春天」這回事。秋天也是如此。所以我那時開頭寫了「紐約沒有春天」這一句。</p>
<p>這是三年前的事。在一個地方住久了，你便發現許多短時期决發現不了的東西，你會覺得你懂得這地方的風土人情實在太少。記得有一位綽號「糟糕」的某君，路過紐約，席尚未暖，回國後，大寫其紐約遊記，把一條比上海南京路還寬還熱閙的紐約第五街（Ｆｉｆｇｈ　Ａｖｅ），譯做「第五巷」，我不知他那貴處的巷子有多寬，但總寛不過中分紐約東西街道的第五街罷。對於這類人物，我祗有佩服他們的胆大。據說國内這樣的人物頗不少，誰說我們是懦弱的民族？</p>
<p>如　果我那時離開了紐約，我也許永遠會說紐約沒有春天。但我一住，住了三年，閒時在紐約各處東鑽西奔，才漸漸知道紐約並不是沒有春天。</p>
<p>在紐約，使你首先感到春天的來臨的，是各種五顏六色的廣吿牌，這些廣吿家眞是所謂能得風氣之先。從天空高架車到地底的地道車，從屋頂到送貨的車上，你不見了那出賣治風寒丸藥的廣吿，或是那廣吿畫中因用Ｌｉｆｅ　ｂｕｏｙ肥皂，除去ＢＯ（狐腋）而得到男子的ｄａｔｅ的姑娘，捨了狐裘，改穿春裝時，你便知道春天快到人間了。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c228">講「打」 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 蠻</p>
<p>我國沿海各地的農村裏，時常保持着一種風氣—械鬥。不但海邊各處如此，内地亦復如此。</p>
<p>說起來，這是一種野蠻的餘風。甲村和乙村的人，往往因爲年時玩燈，賽會，不肯讓一條小路，便彼此爭執起來。爭執之際，必有一塲惡鬥，時常打的頭破血流，死若干，傷若干。隨卽有連年不休的訴訟，弄的許多人傾家蕩產。而賢明的地方官，卽算肯爲百姓排患難，解糾紛，也時常弄的束手無策。</p>
<p>爲什麽彼此不肯稍稍退讓一點呢？他們傳統的觀念，以爲退讓卽是很不吉祥的事。—當然，平日甲村和乙村農民中，或者因了爭田，爭水，種種細故，醖釀下很大的嫌怨，一遇到人多之際，便覺機會到了，非下一種大報復不可，於是打起來，也有的。但卽令彼此相安的農民，到了這種機會，也很容易爭鬥，因爲，退讓於他們「不祥」。</p>
<p>士君子曰··這是ｍｏｂｌ　ｍｏｂ　ｐｉｒｉｔｌ！敎育不普及之過，風氣未開化之過！……</p>
<p>「然而不然」。美洲之燒死黑奴，西歐之亂打猶太人，并不一定是敎育程度的低下的。人類天性中有好鬥的氣分，便是日常各種娛樂，博，奕，也還是以爭勝負而引起興趣的。「好勇過我，無所取材！」孔夫子這麽斥責子路，然已經證明孔子是好勇也頗到極致了，「過」了這極致，當然不行，所以才不足取也。</p>
<p>不祥當然是迷信，但其中有很大的道理，—這里正寓着民族的生機！試想這民族人人「阿彌陀佛」，事事退讓，柔弱到像一團泥，豈不可怕麽？「無懷氏之民」也好，「葛天氏之民」也好，環境一太平，人的精神就要疲弱下去，墮落，退化。美國大學裏讓學生團體爭鬥，打的頭破血流，也不記過開除，并非沒有深理的。</p>
<p>而且，勇武的人是可取的，能勇武然後能慈悲；孔夫子喜歡狂者，因其易於入「道」。軟弱，陰柔，口講慈悲，心懷怨毒，這才沒有了息。</p>

<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>我暗暗在心裏感激着她。同時，一絲倦意侵龑到我身上來，使我禁不住打了個呵欠。我的確有些支持不住了。我在這醫院裏住了已有三天，這三天裏幾乎始終未合過眼，只要聽得妻一些聲音，心便怔忡地跳躍着，惟恐她將要生產。現在她已經生產過了，我的心放了下來，於是困倦便很快的佔領了我的精神。但我却並不想休息，也不想睡，我只是記罣着家裏。三天不回去，家裏不知糟到怎樣一個光景了？灰塵也許已經充滿了一屋子，桌上的信件和刋物也許已經堆積成了一座小丘，這些都需要我回去整理的。於是，我便把這意思吿訴了妻。</p>
<p>妻聽了，並不反對，只是說··「你今晚上一定要回到這里來的。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽」？我茫然的這樣問她。</p>
<p>妻不說話，她的臉忽然紅了。我不禁恍然明白了過來，知道她是爲了膽小，不敢一個人睡在醫院裏。於是，便安慰了她幾句，答應她天黑前一定回來，纔離開了她，搭車回家去。</p>
<p>家裏的情形並不像我理想那樣糟，就是空氣比較冷靜一些，别的毫無什麽變動，灰塵只薄薄的在傢具上舖了一層，桌上的信件和刋物也只有寥寥的四五件。我隨手拆開一封信來看了看，不禁吃了一驚。信是從姑母家來的，報吿我的表兄已經病故了。這消息，實在給了我一個大的激動，因爲四五天前，這位表兄還漂泊在上海，寄住在我們這里；他是爲了在家鄕無法謀生，纔到上海來找出路的，但他却沒有具備什麽才幹，結局是出路沒有找到，反帶了一塲病回去；對於他的不幸，我是深深地表示同情，雖然我很慚愧自己沒有力量帮助他。不過他會這樣快的死去，却是我所想不到的。人生的聚散是多麽迅速呵！我執着信，立在屋裏，瞧着窗外的陽光，不覺有些悵然了。</p>
<p>世界還是這樣一個世界，人生還是這樣一個人生，我依然生活在這世界和這人生裏面，所不同的是我多添了一個孩子，而從童年到現在常和我見着面的表兄却化爲異物了。</p>
<p>「一個靈魂纔降生到世上來，另一個靈魂却已被社會逼上了死路，這到底是怎樣一種人生呢？」我痛苦地這樣想着，一陣顫慄不禁通過了我的全身。我腦裏湧起了一個大問題··要怎樣才能呌我的孩子，將來不會步我這位表兄的後塵，淪於沒落早死的命運呢？</p>
<p>我默默地想着，心却隱隱有些痛楚起來。我不再把孩子的誕生當做一件幸福的事看待了。</p>
<p>晚上，回到醫院裏，妻用笑臉迎接着我，把孩子從被裏取出來給我看，又對我說··</p>
<p>「我忘記問你了，到底我們代他起名呌什麽呢？」</p>
<p>我望着孩子的小臉，眼前却恍惚有新死的表兄的影子在晃動，我不能再向這孩子祝福什麽了。我勉强苦笑了一笑說··</p>
<p>「就呌他做明兒罷。他雖然產生在黎明的時候，但到底能不能給這個世界帶一些光明來，還是說不定的。」</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>這一叚傳說，實在是很有詩意的一篇宫　小閱說；大約因爲牠太有詩意了罷，所以臨安志於潛志，都詳載此事，藉做裝飾。結果弄得東天目有洗眼池，昭明寺，太子殿，分經臺，西天目也同樣的有洗眼池，昭明寺，太子殿，分經臺。文人活在世上，文章往往不値半分錢，大抵饑餓以死。到了肉化成灰，骨變成炭的時候，却大家都要來攀龍附鳳，爭奪起來了，這豈眞是文學的永久性的効力麽？分析起來，我想唯物的原因，總也是不少的。因爲文人活着，是一樣的要吃飯穿衣生兒子的，到得死了幾百年之後，則物的供給，當然是可以不要。提一提起某曾住此，某曾到此，活人倒可以吸引遊客，占幾文光；和尚道士，更可以藉此去募化騙錢，造起莊嚴燦爛的寺觀寳殺來，這若不是唯物的原因又是什麽？</p>
<p>從獅子口出來，看了千文岩，獅子岩，緣山徑向東，過樹底下有一泓水在的洗鉢池，更繞過所謂樹王的寻一顆有十五六抱大的大杉樹，行一二里路，就到了更上一層的開山老殿。這自獅子口至開山殿的山腰上的一叚路，都平坦，老樹奇石多極，寬平廣大的空基也一塊一塊的不知有多少，前面說過的西天目古代的寺院，一定是在這一帶地方的無疑，開山老殿或者就是師子正宗禪寺，也說不定。開山殿後軒，掛在那裏的一塊徐世昌寫的大樹堂大字匾額，想係指樹王而說的了。實際上，這兒的大樹很多，也並不能算得唯一的希奇景緻，西天目的絕景，却在離開所謂　掛蓮花之，　　條百丈來高的　　　　　　立在那裏，看起來像一朶蓮花。這蓮花的背後，更有一條絕壁，約有二百丈高，和蓮花的一瓣相對峙，立在壁下向上看出去，只有一線二三尺寬的天，白茫茫的照在上面。蓮花石旁，離開幾尺的地方，又有一座石臺，上面平坦，建有一個八角的亭子。在去這亭子的路東，奇岩一簇，也像是向天的佛手，兀立在深谷的高頭。上這佛手指山老殿不遠，向南突出去的兩支巖鼻上頭··從這兩支岩鼻上看下去的山谷全景，纔是西天目的唯一大觀；語堂大師到了西天目，而不到此地來一賞附近的山谷全景，與陡削直立的峭壁奇岩，纔呌是天下的大錯，纔呌是Ｄｉｃｈｔｕｎｇ反滅了Ｗａｈａｈｅｉｔ！</p>
<p>岩鼻的一支，是從開山殿前稍下向南，憑空拖出約有一里地長的獨立奇峯，卽和尚們所說的倒掛蓮花的那一塊地方。頭，去向南一展望，則幾百里路内的溪谷，人家，小山，田地，都看得淸淸楚楚；一條一條的谷，一縷一縷的溪，一隴一塢的田，拿一個　喻來說，極像是一把倒垂的扇子；扇骨就是由西天目分下去的餘脈，扇骨中間的白紙，就是介在兩脈之間的溪谷與鄕村，還有畫在這扇子上面的名畫，更是一幅菜花黃桃花紅李花白山色樹木一抹靑靑的極細巧的工筆畫！</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>不一會，門鈴響了起來，接着兩個孩子爭先走來嚷着說··</p>
<p>「有客人來啦！」大的孩子說過後，又回過頭去，很生疏地望着來客。</p>
<p>父親應着孩子的話走出去，當然是對孩子說過的那個客人，他自己招呼過後，很親愛地俯下了身子，拍着孩子的肩頭說··</p>
<p>「便是我方才對你們說的客人了，你們都呌聲麗姑吧！」</p>
<p>孩子都有點羞怯地呌了一聲。客人是一個年靑的女子，穿着深紅的旗袍，微卷着髮，長圓的臉，含着微笑，顯得很温柔的樣子。她走近孩子面前，把兩個精緻美麗的盒子分給他們。小的孩子向盒子看了一會，笑着說··「爸爸。是巧格力呢！」</p>
<p>「對啦，你高興了嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子看了看含笑的父親，也看看那微笑的客人，感謝客人這滿意的禮物似的。到後他們看見父親陪客人在客室裏坐下了，陸媽端過了花，兩人便退到了書室·　得有女客來的家庭，而且每人又得到一盒愛吃的東西，格外的興奮咧。</p>
<p>「哥，我歡喜你那盒，你看，你的盒子有紅花，我那個不是紅的。」女孩子拉住了哥哥的手說。</p>
<p>做哥哥的給她這末一說，好像眞的自己一盒比她的好，搖着頭不肯了。可是她仍舊要求着，於是他說··</p>
<p>女那麽我們都拆開來吧，看看可都是巧格力！」</p>
<p>糖是一樣的糖，妹妹便不再說話了。他們各人含了一塊，跑到客室那邊去。父親正和客人親熱的談着話，父親的快樂樣子，在平時是難得見到的。看見他們走來。父親笑着望他們一眼。又向客人說··「　觀一下我們的書室吧！」客人便站起身子，攙了女孩的手，父親走在前面，把每種東西指點給客人看。</p>
<p>「我一回到家裏，總是在這兒工作的，你看吧。東西凌亂得這樣了，太不成話了。　　客人還是高興地笑着，點着頭。那女孩子老是仰起臉看他們說笑，忽然她記起衣架那邊母親的照，便撒嬌地對客人說··</p>
<p>「那邊還有媽媽的照啦，看吧！」</p>
<p>客人跟着小手指示的地方看去，那是一張年靑女人的照像。那有力的眼神，短短的髮，嘴角上掛着微笑，表示那很有果斷的神情。女孩子仍舊望着客人，做哥哥的向母親的照看了一會，也一樣地看着客人；他們以爲客人一定要快樂地稱贊他們的媽媽。可是他們看見客人的笑影淡了下去，向父親看了一眼，拍着女孩的肩頭說··</p>

<h3 id="c256">華北危機 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>自從九一八發動以來，華北無時不在極嚴重的危機之中，這危機至去年塘沽恊定簽定前數月，而達至空前未有的緊張程度。塘沽恊定簽定以後，華北危機，雖暫稍形緩和，但暗中仍行發展不已。戰區的遲不交還，勦匪的困難，僞軍的出沒不已，以及多倫的被佔取，察綏吿急，日機不時飛巡於平郊、都使整個華北無時不在危疑震撼之中，黃河以北，差不多九一八以來沒有一刻平靜安定過。</p>
<p>日本的侵略中國，是很有步驟的。九一八未發動前，正當世界經濟恐慌發展到極深刻之時，各國經濟政治，都十分動盪不安，他逆料這一個炸彈下去，各國自顧不暇，都沒有辦法來干涉的。果然，九一八事變爆發，只不過在世界政治上增加了一些騷動，而日本的行動，却始終沒有一個人敢出來說他不對，甚至反而暗中帮忙。這一着是被日本料定了。</p>
<p>日本旣佔有我國東北，一手應付世界，最重要的，一手還要應付中國民衆，因爲中國的民衆是反帝抗日的，這時他的全付精神就在對付中國，假若中國不敢再動再響，那時他就容易對世界講話了。其間經相當努力的結果，果然中國是不敢再動再響了。日本的目的，如意的達到。</p>
<p>中國屈服後，日本還要對世界相與努力怎樣使世界列强、對日本行動，由反對的態度而變作贊成至少是不問不聞的態度，再進而承認僞國，這是日本所竭力期求的。自然，結果是很有相當成績的，承認僞國，雖還沒有這麽快，不問不聞的態度，是要求到了。</p>
<p>然而，中國事實上是屈服了，可是，還沒有承認僞國；其次，蘇聯的存在，也是日本帝國主義發展的一個最大的討厭。怎樣使中國由事實上的屈伏，再進一步而簡直的承僞國呢？怎樣把蘇聯趕跑，讓他無阻碍的發展呢？這是目前日本年苦心焦慮，去籌劃應付着的。而目前華北的緊張，華北危機的日深一日，正就是日本這一策劃的表現。</p>
<p>日本的以武力控縱華北，使華北不會有一刻安靜，一方面向察綏進窺，其目的卽··一，迫使我國承認僞國，在武力强制之下進行直接交涉；二，向蘇聯挑戰，迫使蘇聯後退。此外，以昔之對付東省者對付華北，隱操華北經濟政治命脈，待至時期一至，卽進一步再進佔我國黃河以北。這就是目前華北危機所以日深一日的由來了。</p>
<p>東省已失，華北則在日本武力控制之下，不久的將來，日本必進一步以昔之取東省者取我華北，華北得手，就要再進一步窺我華中與華南。雖然那時日本要不要與英美各國發生更激烈的衝突，那是又一問題，總之日本預定目的是如此的。國人記着，不要以爲局部的屈伏就可換得日本永久的和平，須知這是他侵略中國一步一步一定的步驟，他的最後目的，却是在我全中國！</p>
<h3 id="c257">職業與婚姻的自由和社會關係 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>我們要是把社會上的一切自殺事件來統計一下，那末所得到的結果··爲了受經濟的壓迫—失業，沒得出路—與婚姻的不自由底原因者，恐怕要佔去一半以上的份兒吧！這個我們是可以肯定地說的。爲了討論，研究（？）這兩個現代靑年們的切身問題—職業與婚姻—確是已經費過了不少參加者的精力，各色的墨汁，各報章的篇幅了；但事實上，因爲這種事件，依舊如根深蒂固的地流行在這社會的各階層，有增無减而未得絲毫解决。因此在一般乏味無感了的學者們，若一聞到這種問題，就顯得不勝不煩了，因爲他們早就認之爲「老生常談」的了。但事實不是早吿訴了我們，這問題可不會是這樣簡單的。</p>
<p>本來，職業與婚姻的問題，並不是一個單純的孤立的問題。牠們是和整個的社會有着密切關係的，這是，除了一輩子只願顧問到「片面」的人們外，誰都看到與承認的了。並且，在人類過去的歷史過程上，本已經指示了我們··一個社會，在一個時代和一個制度之下，是一個有着牠的不同的各種各樣的社會現象與其關緊的總和；而且在一個不同的社會中，牠的種種精神關係——一般的社會現象—是受着牠的物質的經濟關係所决定，所支配的。好了，我們旣認識了這些現實的客觀的條件··職業與婚姻須得受客觀的物質條件所支配的，那末我們是不難明瞭在現階段社會中的所謂職業與婚姻的自由問題了。</p>
<p>各資本主義列强與中國是有着直接關係的，這是誰都不會加以否認的吧！因此我們若要明白我們今日的社會，同時，就也得非認識牠們不可。不是已經早早了嗎？在各方面都可看得··在於各個資本主義國家的内部，也在於各帝國主義中間相互鬥爭的世界舞台上，一切資本主義制度的矛盾已經最深入地尖銳化，這就是這成了各個餈本主義國家的整個國民經濟都「週期性的」，「突進式的」，不停地低落。由於這個資本主義的並遍的恐慌，產生了力大無比的「世界經濟恐慌」，震撼了，激盪了整個世界的每一角。</p>
<p>我們中國，當然够不上成之爲資本主義國家，但是歷來就成了各資本主義列强相互自由競爭的大市塲··這樣，我們素來就不穩健的混雜的經濟組織，在這個狂瀾大浪的「世界經濟恐慌」的激盪之下，就只有同樣地「加倍的」隨着牠們—資本主義的普遍的恐慌—沒落，沒落！同時，社會各階層間的距離的加强，無疑地也就成了「正比例」。看吧！整個農村經濟的大崩潰，中間層者——小商人，中小農，薪給生活者等—的破產，沒落，崩潰，造成了駭人的失業人數的突增了各色各樣的社會病態··工廠，商店的倒閉，勞資糾紛，囚犯的猛增，自殺……都是應時而起的可驚可悲的事實！</p>
<p>够了，這種種現象，都足以給我們極彰明的指示；在這個「加倍地」沒落的現階段中，「適者生存」是主要的條件，競爭，掙扎，排擠…是最切身的本領。這樣，在今日要想職業上的「自由」，則當然何從談起的了。但也有是例外的，那只是因爲在這社會經濟組織裏，經濟是何上的權威者，因此惟有得助於牠，才得有今日的「自由」！至關於婚姻的自由問題，本刋對此討論的很多，合其結論··一切都是商品化了的今日，這個—婚姻自主與先决條件的自由戀愛—也當然不能例外，因此這不過是有錢者的「專利品」，而同時也只是金錢香粉之交換，買賣的自由競爭罷了！總而言之··這終不能逃脫了社會的環境支配也！　　每一個問題之所以要成爲「老生常談」，這就因爲牠竟「常談老生」着吧—「常」爲人所「談」而仍「老」是「生」存着也—這樣，就很明顯地吿訴了我們這種問題不只是在嘴上紙上談談所能解决的了。靑年的朋友們！現在，惟有靠了自己，依着歷史過程上下來的「路綫」與指示，認識今日不斷地發展的一切「現實」，來决定自己的「趨向」，負起應有的「命使」，才能得獲到所需的眞正底「自由」了！</p>

<p>拄長了視綫，往遠處平望過去，一大片停落在樹頭的紅雲，今我立刻想起幼時老師命我作春游記時，抄襲來的二句作形容語的「芳草鮮美，落英繽紛。」　　我沒有感觸，更沒有什麽思維！其實也不容有這些！這一刹那，我盡力的擯棄存積在腦中的宿念，讓這些新鮮的生命要素，着實地滋潤我一下。一個暮氣沈沈的靑年人，不該再依依不捨着已消逝去的東西，要是不願空洞的憧憬着未來的話，至少須切實地享受目前的一分，一秒，甚至於一閃。</p>
<p>「對酒當歌，人生幾何？譬如朝露，去日無多一。朋友，這似朝露般的人生，　　　　　，輕輕地錯過嗎？過去的，已無情地離你而去了；未來的，正渺茫着。</p>

<p>身子隨着脚步優然地前進着，前進着，最後，在一個轼田溝旁停留了下來。　　田溝裏的水流，當然不能同潺潺的泉水相比，但是，水的淸澄，未必一定遜於泉水，然而，泉水是被人崇仰，田溝水却被人輕視，實在呌我不能無感。是的，田溝水是平凡，不過灌溉灌溉而已··泉水，則不然。這是虎跑，這是天下第一泉，有一輩閒情逸趣的名士之流，肯不惜他的寳墨來大筆一揮，題上個諸如此類的雅名；至於田溝水，人們幾乎不屑瞧它一瞧。我不懂的就是··泉水除外表上有個奇突之趣以外，實質上還有些什麽呢？泉水的所以被人崇仰，大槪就爲着它的外表了。——這眞可以見得世情的一般，重外表而輕内容。對於東西是這樣，對於人又何嘗另眼看待呢？</p>
<p>我注視着田溝裏，看見有數不淸的蝌蝌，靠着水兩旁的泥土鑽着。一球球黑的小動物，在我眼簾裏一時不息地浮動着。這一球的小動物，不是人類的最切當的縮影？—無意識地忙着求生存，但終至於死，這樣一代繼一代，沒有間斷。</p>

<p>— 薔薇</p>
<p>女人，從生下時就帶來了一種惑人的誘力，那白晳的肌膚，櫻桃的紅唇，窈窕的身腰，自古以來，不知曾醉倒了幾許男子；並且那種聲腔也是够動人的。</p>
<p>「白蘭花，梔子花！」</p>
<p>是一種淸脆的動人的聲調，就像機械的鬧鐘似的，在每個淸晨，在一定的時候，把我從夢中警醒。</p>
<p>「白蘭花，梔子花，」一聲接着一聲地從小弄的這頭唱到那頭，像是唱着曲調樣的含着一種媚人的節奏。這樣的曲調整年不變地在淸晨唱出，祇是依着時季，有時唱出了「玫瑰花，」有時唱出了繡球花。」有時唱出了「夜來香，」有時唱出了「菊花，」有時唱出了「臘梅花，」也有時唱出了「水仙花，」可是曲調是一律的，用着一樣的節奏，在那寂靜的淸晨唱出。</p>
<p>有時我像是夢到了一種奇異的境界，一種美妙的仙樂在空中震動，於是就會習慣地像是有種力在催促着，很費力地掙扎着睜開了眼睛，於是一種用着很小心的低聲的叩門聲從門邊傳進，接着就有另一種媚人的節奏淸脆地呌出··「先生，白蘭花要𠲎？」</p>
<p>這樣的節奏，我曾習慣地聽着，這樣的情景，我曾習慣的度着，那賣花的姑娘也曾在我這門裏，習慣地走熟了。每天她走進了我這門裏，每天她給我送來了鮮花，每天她給我了一個更深的影像。於是我們就這樣的稔熟了。</p>
<p>她還是一個天眞的姑娘，纔十五歲，可是她出有了職業，在自己謀生了！　　從春天到夏天，從秋天到冬天，在每個淸晨，她用着同樣淸脆的聲調，兜賣鮮花，這是她的職業，然而她的淸脆的聲腔就像比了鮮花更動人地引動了人們的憐惜。</p>
<p>上星期的某一天，我習慣地在那一定的時候醒轉，可是那習慣聽到了的賣花姑娘的節奏却沉寂了，我待着待着，那習慣看到的影像却終不再映入我的眼簾了，這樣，在我每天淸晨醒轉時，我就會失望地像是失掉了一些失麽東西；每天我都在期待着那失掉的東西歸來，可是每天我都失望了。</p>
<p>今天，我習慣地又在那一定的時候醒轉　像是那一種同樣的節奏在那弄裏傳來！我興奮地盼望着那種、小心的低　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　地從小弄的這頭唱到那頭，却並不唱到我的門邊。於是我重又失望地爬起了床，推開了窗，向那節奏唱出的地方望去，可是那已不是我習慣看到的那個影像了，那是一個老年的女人和一個年齡更小的姑娘。我就借着買花，把她們呌了過來，順便向他們打聽着那以前一個賣花姑娘的消息。原來那老年女人是她的母親，那年齡更小的姑娘是她的妹妹。她呢？因爲給王公館裏的老爺瞧中意了，要去做姨太太了。</p>
<p>「她年紀不是還很小嗎？」我問。　　「原是因爲她年紀小纔有人要呀！像我，年紀倒和我那女婿相彷些，可是老了，誰要呢？……可是我那女兒年紀又不小了，開了年就是十六歲啦！……現在我就領這小女兒出來賣花了，她纔八歲呢！</p>
<p>「唔，女人，正像鮮花要揀含苞初放的，女人，値錢的也就在靑春的時期，「老了，誰要「呢」」我默念着。</p>

<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我現在是二十四歲，父母將於本年底爲我娶妻，原來我在十歲上下就給我攀親了。到民國十八九年時，那個未曾相識的未婚妻，不幸染病致亡，在我還不甚介意。而我的母親却曾爲此惋惜。我以爲從此可以自己來擇妻了。而且也曾在父母親面前聲明，以後不必爲我代勞，然而，儘管你怎樣的費去唇舌，他們却不來聽你的話。</p>
<p>就在民國二十年夏初，他們竟毫不通知我一聲，便實行定親的儀式了，當我還在上海校裏讀書，待暑假返家，得悉之下，已沒有挽回的可能，事成以後，我聽到了這事的經過和彼方的底細，當初彼方是我家嬸母的房客，朝夕見面，自然熟悉而親近了，我母親因爲那個女兒性情温柔寡言，兼有搖洋襪的手藝，就此看中了，而我父親却馬馬虎虎，永沒有一次肯定的表白·所以，事情的促成完全出於我母親一人的意見。她家起先在無錫城中，失業了才搬到我們鄕鎭來，全家生活費全靠兩個女兒搖洋襪的出息，大女兒業已出嫁，所以，生活愈形艱難，作做吃吃尚難勉强維持，要使女兒受敎育那當然是不可能的了。</p>
<p>從那以後家庭之間便有了好幾次的爭執，在我也就多掉了幾次的苦涙。我反抗的理由，是沒有根基於雙方愛情，以及彼方的不識字·我的許多朋友對於這件事，都勸我不必反抗，而且還爲我解釋，她不識字，只要結婚以後你去敎她，也未始不能寫信看書，還爲我欣喜，說你到有一個經濟獨力的妻子。</p>
<p>我爲這事經過很多次的苦惱，還是妥恊呢？還不不肯呢？每當前進的刺激襲來，我便會發奮地興起反抗的心理。但一遇着什麽餒氣，我却又會綿羊似地　　，自言自解，不必多　　突，有時</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>我覺得反抗是無力，我便想不與聞這事的意念。最使我憂慮的便是從那時以來，靑春之火像已澆熄，什麽志願都給打消了，勇猛的念頭再也不敢多想一想。我相信，沒有結婚以前旣已如此了，結婚以後會多麽的死寂下去，消毁下去。　　妥恊呢，我知道我就緊緊的被縳住，永沒有翻身的一天，怕從無聲無氣的終了一生，雖則反抗了後，究竟如何還在不可知之數中，反抗呢，我斷定會發生親子間感情上的破裂的定會傷壞他們老人家的心。至於冷淡，我知道事情終有爆發的一天，永不能被你逃脫得的，所以，現在的問題是我還是順從心意而妥恊呢，還是尊重我自己的願望而反抗呢？</p>
<p>如果反抗，那末，定親時一百元的茶禮，自然沒有歸還的希望，而彼方是否可有拒絕解除婚約的理由而我將怎樣說服老人家的忿恨，將怎樣安慰老人家的苦痛。</p>
<p>我很知道，我母親爲我娶妻的大原因是可以卸去她的責任，同時還可以得着帮助料理家務的人，在我，或者不能滿意，這種抛妻子於家中，任其過孤單的生活，居心不仁的行爲。别的問題或者可以按下，要我去敎她讀書，我可不能·一則我自己也有事，那有餘閒·一則她是否有餘力去學還是問題·所以，要我妥恊，我的精神上的苦痛自不必說了，對於我的事業，非特沒有帮助的希望，甚且還有阻碍的憎惡。過蘇民　　答··這封信是由本報流通圖書館讀書指導部轉來的。像過君這種情形極其普通。是現在這種新舊交替，急激轉變的社會中應有的問題。</p>
<p>固然，男女結合應以愛情爲基礎，婚姻應當自主。但是編者從前已經說過，婚姻雖則是終身大事，但不是終身唯一的事。婚姻美滿當然是畢生幸福，婚姻不美滿也不見得幸福喪盡。所以一般靑年對於婚姻，極宜審愼，不能絲毫馬虎；確是應該，不過，若把一穎心整個兒放在配偶問題上，也似乎把人生看得太渺小了罷。</p>
<p>我們認爲結婚與飲食一樣，雖不可少，却無甚意義。所以我們不願一般靑年造出「爲結婚或戀愛而生活」的格言。　　因此我們認爲，祗要配偶能够不妨碍你所願從事的事業，相處尚能相安，就是相貎才學稍爲差些，了不見得你的一生就有什麽缺憾。所以你對於令堂對於你定的婚的非常不滿的似乎是偏見太深。須知你現在假若愛上了一個很摩登的女孩，當時固然覺得非常幸福，但如你物質條件不够，不能供養她，這種幸福恐怕也未必能永久，也許有後悔不迭的日子，當然這也不可一槪而論，摩登女子確也有能够刻苦的，然究係少數。所以，編者認爲，你對於家庭所定的婚也不宜一味盲目反對，却要看看對方究竟如何，將來同居能否相安無事。不識字雖是一項缺憾，但不通事理，爲害更大。假如她雖不識字，與你倒還投機，那也不見得就不可結婚。所以，編者認爲，你目前所應做的事，是極力設法多多與對方接近，觀察她的爲人，如果覺得她與你還沒有大衝突的地方，硬要退婚可說是毫無理由。不過，以後觀察，却要完全改變這封信上的所揉取的態度，你應當以性格，旨趣之能否接近爲斷，却不可拿才貎，學識作標凖。</p>
<p>經過這番愼重考慮，然後再堅决談結婚或退婚，現在可不必掉苦涙，無須乎消沉下去。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan convened a review meeting on the morning of the 19th to examine the North China diplomatic issues submitted by the General Assembly last week. Chairman Fu Bingchang led the discussion, the content of which included: (1) Regarding the General Assembly's submission for research on the North China issue and inquiries to the diplomatic authorities, since Wang Yougan returned to Nanjing, all questions that the legislators had intended to raise had been explained in detail by Wang during meetings with President Sun and Chairman Fu, making everything fully understood. Therefore, it was decided that no further questions would be raised. (2) The issues of through-traffic and through-mail are only part of the diplomacy with Japan, and the diplomatic authorities have not considered this recently, so there is no need to express opinions at this time. (3) Recently, various committees believe that current diplomacy should not only focus on the North China issue but also pay close attention to the trends of international relations and the future of the East Asian situation, taking a long-term perspective to clearly understand the importance of diplomacy in order to cope with the complex situation in the future. Various committee members successively expressed their views, and a concrete discussion was held on the overall diplomatic issue. These opinions will be presented to the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 20th. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 19th, Wang invited Legislative Yuan members Lou Tongsun to his official residence for a detailed discussion on the current diplomatic situation, providing further explanations and seeking advice.

<p>(Nanjing) Washington, 18th - The New York Tribune editorial commented on Japan's new policy toward China, stating that Japan's constraint on China's relations with foreign countries will leave China with only nominal independence and sovereignty, turning it into a Japanese protectorate. Japan's ambitions did not begin today; the Twenty-One Demands and the Japanese Monroe Doctrine advocated by Ishii had already been revealed in the past. The newspaper's discussion of Japan's greedy pursuit of control over China's power is not surprising. What is astonishing is that Japan hopes the world will recognize it as the self-appointed guardian of China's foreign affairs. However, for Western countries to allow Japan or any country to have this power, major countries must agree to abandon the Nine-Power Treaty. Such a demonstration of special trust in one country is probably unprecedented in the international community. The newspaper concluded that if Japan now claims to be the maintainer of peace in the Far East and hopes to be recognized internationally, it indicates: (1) recognizing that the Nine-Power Treaty, which it has already violated, is a dead letter; (2) no longer valuing the confidence that the West has in Japan. The newspaper concluded that if Japan takes such measures, it will prove that the League of Nations' judgment of Japan's spiritual isolation is more correct and reasonable.

True and Lasting Peace Between China and Japan Must Be Built on a Foundation of Goodwill and Understanding <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese Foreign Ministry unofficially issued a statement on April 17th explaining its policy toward China, various European and American countries were deeply surprised and inquired about the details from the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Regarding this matter, our Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued the following statement on the 19th: China firmly believes that the maintenance of international peace depends on the collective efforts of all countries in the world. If long-term peace is to be maintained internationally, it is especially necessary to promote the sincere spirit of mutual understanding and eliminate the root causes that could lead to disputes. No country in the world can claim to have the sole responsibility for maintaining international peace anywhere. As a member state of the League of Nations, China considers it its due obligation to promote international cooperation and facilitate international peace and security. In its efforts to achieve this goal, China has never intended to harm any other country, nor has it ever had the intention of disrupting peace in East Asia. The relationship between China and other countries in pursuing the above-mentioned goals is the same as that which should exist between any independent sovereign states. What China must especially explain is that China's cooperation with other countries, whether in the form of loans or technical assistance, is always limited to non-political matters. As for the purchase of military supplies, such as military aircraft, and the employment of military instructors or experts, it is only for the needs of national defense and is mostly for maintaining domestic order and tranquility. If other countries have no ambitions towards China, there is no need to worry too much about China's policies to seek construction and security. As for the current situation between China and Japan, it must be solemnly stated that true and lasting peace between the two countries, just as between any other countries, must be built on a foundation of goodwill and mutual understanding. If existing unfair situations can be rectified and the relationship between China and Japan can be improved, taking into account the common aspirations of both countries, the establishment of the aforementioned foundation of peace will be achieved with half the effort and twice the result.

<h3 id="e6">Kailuan Coal Mine Strike Has a Tendency to Expand Again. Tangjiazhuang and Linxi Mines Under Surveillance by Mine Police. Only Inside Shift Has Resumed Work; Outside Shift Continues to Strike. Tangshan Mine in a State of Unrest Again. <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangjiazhuang and Linxi mines' outside workers were instigated by Zhao Dazhong's accomplices, brewing a strike for many days, so the authorities attach great importance to this. It is hoped that the provincial government will send a telegram to Tao Shangming, ordering him to deal with it strictly and arrest the ringleaders for trial in Tianjin. It is reported that the Mining Bureau has received a detailed report on the Tangjiazhuang and Linxi mine strike. The workers in Tangjiazhuang, in collusion with Zhao Dazhong, had planned an uprising, secretly taking coal blocks as weapons when they left work each day. At 7:30 PM on the 17th, Li Xinru, the captain of the security team stationed at the mine, heard the news and urgently led the police to guard the entrance of the mine, searching the workers. When they found coal blocks, they ordered them to be sent back into the mine. The workers refused to listen, resulting in a conflict. The workers threw coal blocks at the police, injuring several in the body. The police, in self-defense, opened fire, killing one worker and injuring four. The workers were then angered and went on strike. The workers in Linxi Mine, upon hearing the news at 10 PM, also went on strike in response. Yesterday, Zhao Dazhong sent representatives to reorganize the Linxi workers, but they were beaten back by the old workers' association. The workers in Majiagou and Zhao Gezhuang mines have not taken any action. The police in each area have taken surveillance actions. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan Public Security Bureau, fearing that the Tangjiazhuang strike would spread to the Tangshan Mine, imposed temporary martial law. The Tangshan Mine is already in a state of unrest. The outside workers who have not yet resumed work are also planning to take the opportunity to stir up trouble. The Public Security Bureau is closely monitoring them. The striking workers in Tangjiazhuang and Linxi have chanted slogans: (1) increase wages by eight cents; (2) pay coal money; (3) reorganize the labor union. The slogans they raised are the same as those of the Tangshan Mine strike. However, the mine authorities had not yet received the workers' formal demands as of noon on the 19th.

<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan War Zone Security Team cracked down on a pseudo Sino-Japanese-Manchu Border Region Command on the 18th at No. 14, Rende Lane, Gudong, capturing two people: pseudo-Governor Sun Huanting and pseudo-Chief Investigator He Yadong. Multiple pseudo-appointment letters were seized. Many of their accomplices, such as section chiefs and directors, escaped. On the 19th, the two criminals were escorted to the province. The arrested pseudo-Governor Sun Huanting, 40 years old, is a rogue from eastern Tianjin who colluded with the Japanese and planned to recruit desperadoes for a large-scale uprising. His important leader, Lin Cheng, resides in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin. There are currently various types of pseudo-official seals. In Tianjin, he was buying and selling positions through bribery. Wang Guanwu, the adjutant of the Security Team, investigated and verified this, and reported it to Zhao Lei, who dispatched a team to arrest him. (19th Dispatch)</p>

It is reported that it had a battle with Chinese fishermen in the Yellow Sea, 65 miles from Dalian, resulting in four sailors being injured, including the captain of the 加賀丸, Sato. According to him, the conflict arose because the nets of the boat and the Chinese fishing boats became entangled. The Chinese immediately attacked with iron rods. Although the Japanese were outnumbered, they still repelled the Chinese. The Chinese then invited more boats to attack. Fortunately, it gradually became dark, and the Japanese boat took the opportunity to escape. Furthermore, 加賀丸 No. 1, which had been fishing with No. 11, has not been found to date.

<p>Arms reduction has recently become a major issue in Europe. The British arms reduction proposal seems to be supported by various countries on the surface. However, a glance at the French government's communication to the British government reveals that it implicitly contains an extremely contradictory meaning. What it considers serious is, on the one hand, Germany's independent expansion of armaments, and on the other hand, France's own security guarantees. After Germany withdrew from the disarmament conference and the League of Nations, it loudly advocated strengthening national defense. Its national defense budget for land, sea, and air forces from 1934 to 1935 totaled 7.027427 million marks, an increase of about 150 million marks compared to the previous year. The total amount of its aviation department's budget was 190,476,000 marks. Compared with the world's major powers, the number is indeed very small, but from France's observation, it cannot help but deeply feel threatened and believe that the security guarantee of French national defense is at risk of being shaken. Therefore, it repeatedly emphasizes security guarantees and focuses not only on the strengthening of its own national defense but also on Britain's practical assistance and the use of the disarmament conference as its support to ensure that Germany cannot take any rebellious actions under the supervision of the common agreement of various countries, and hopes that this move can be extended indefinitely.</p>
<p>After the European War, this strategy has been maintained for sixteen years. The German anti-resistance sentiment and its domestic situation have become unbearable. Therefore, Hitler raised his arms and called out, and responses arose from all sides. The spirit of the Third Reich spread throughout the German people. France has no way to suppress this kind of German inner spirit and can only be on emergency alert at all times. If Germany reconstitutes a huge and powerful army in a short period of time, France will use diplomacy to launch an international common front against Germany. This is the intention expressed in the document sent to Britain on arms reduction, strongly stating that Germany's increase in military spending is unreasonable. At the same time, France's finances are in difficulty, and the situation is getting worse due to maintaining the gold standard. The budget for this year is insufficient and has reached 180 billion francs, while the purely consumptive military budget has not been slightly reduced. Therefore, it has to make extensive use of the League of Nations to create an international united front to contain Germany and to make the maintenance of the security guarantee of France its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Little does it know that today's League of Nations no longer has the dignity of the past. The Germans have become very indifferent to it. The reason for its loss of credibility is, first, that international diplomacy has returned to the horizontal and vertical situation before 1914, mostly focusing on the secret strategies of various alliances. The use of the conference venue has almost become a thing of the past. Moreover, the major countries supporting the League of Nations are only Britain and France, and Britain's original intention to restrict Germany is fundamentally different from that of France. Second, although Italy has not completely left the League of Nations, its attempts to oppose it are very obvious, and it has also contacted Austria and Hungary to form another international system. This system has no benefit to Germany but poses a considerable obstacle to the League of Nations and is enough to give France's security guarantees a head-on blow. Third, the various small countries were originally satellites of France, that is, powerful tools for restricting the four borders of Germany. Recently, since the small Entente countries in the Danube River basin have gradually formed a system, they will no longer be directed by France and will be independent, which is unfavorable to both the League of Nations and arms reduction. As for Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and other countries, the requirements for promoting arms reduction and supplementing security guarantees can only have some support in public opinion, and there is no loss or gain in practical matters.</p>
<p>At this time, France's most powerful plan is to invite the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations to increase its momentum and, at the same time, remove Germany's support in politics, diplomacy, and economics. In the past, the Soviet Union was very unwilling to abandon its revolutionary traditional policy to negotiate with France. Now that Germany is tending towards absolute nationalism, the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union suddenly feels significantly inconvenient under certain circumstances. Therefore, it is necessary to open up another diplomatic outlet in Europe. At the same time, military crises are appearing everywhere in the Far East, such as the border regions of northern Manchuria. If the western border line cannot be ensured safely, the Soviet Union cannot avoid falling into a dangerous situation. As a result, the relationship between France and the Soviet Union is becoming closer, and the issue of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations has become a new topic in Geneva diplomacy.</p>
<p>In short, the struggle between the two forces of maintaining the status quo and breaking the status quo is becoming more intense due to the weakness of the League of Nations and more acute due to the paralysis of arms reduction. However, the countries of the world are also expanding the scope of their nationalistic dominance and are actively engaged in military preparations, but each country is not easy to get a true allied country. If they cannot get the practical help of allied countries, they dare not rashly challenge. Therefore, the situation of standoff and stagnation still looms over Europe.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of various countries jointly assisting China, last night the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made strong remarks to reporters, stating that if international cooperation to assist China disrupts peace and security, Japan will take active measures. If other countries resort to force, Japan will also respond with force. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese government spokesperson declared that Japan would actively oppose any form of international assistance to China. The League of Nations was not surprised upon hearing this policy statement, feeling that it was an inevitable result of Japan's desire to exclusively control hegemony in the Far East. Embracing this policy, Japan has often opposed international efforts to cooperate technically with China, especially foreign loans to China, which Japan particularly opposes. Therefore, in May 1931, when the League of Nations and China first had a proposal for cooperation, Japan immediately protested. The Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations General Assembly to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute is scheduled to meet next month, and the subcommittee of the League of Nations Executive Council, also tasked with considering this same issue, will meet even earlier. It is widely believed that both committees will discuss what policies the League of Nations will adopt in the future regarding the Sino-Japanese issue. Some here believe that Japan's statement contains a policy of closing China's doors, not just monopolizing rights in Manchuria as a result of the Manchurian Incident. However, the League of Nations hopes that the situation in the Far East will strengthen Soviet Russia's desire to join the League of Nations. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) British authorities do not want to make any comment on Japan's statement regarding the situation in the Far East until they receive a formal report from the British Ambassador to Japan. However, according to Chinese officials here, this move by Japan is merely an attempt to gauge the attitude of European and American countries towards Japan's intention to monopolize China. Furthermore, according to Britons who are familiar with the current situation in the Far East, it may not be easy for Japan to expand its influence in China because of the Nine-Power Treaty. Even the 1920 Four-Power Consortium stipulated that new investments in China must be done jointly. (19th, Guomin Dian)</p>
<p>(London) During today's session of the House of Commons, Liberal Party Member of Parliament Johnstone mentioned Japan's recent declaration regarding China.

It is still uncertain whether it was a responsible declaration. The Foreign Secretary added that he would need to wait for a detailed report before he could continue to comment on this matter. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the *Daily Telegraph* published an article today, stating that British officials are unwilling to hastily criticize the remarks made in Tokyo yesterday about not allowing other countries to interfere in Chinese affairs. However, officials acknowledge the seriousness of the tone and the importance of its implications. It is widely expected that Japan intends to use empty threats of military intervention to prevent foreigners from lending money to China, hoping to make foreigners wary of the risks of lending and deter them from investing in China.

<p>(Washington) News has come from Tokyo that "the Japanese government intends to firmly declare its policy towards China." Government officials here do not want to comment, as they have not yet received the full text of the note that Tokyo intends to deliver to the governments of the countries concerned. However, judging from the general idea released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, this note is directed at the United States. It is not difficult to see that some here believe that this action by Japan is a sign of the resurgence of the power of its military clique, which will completely destroy any hope that the exchange of notes between Hull and Hirota could have produced. People here are comparing the statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a document published by the Japanese English-language newspaper *Japan Times and Mail*, which was also distributed to various American newspapers. This document, written by the Japanese political group "Shiunso," has already "obtained the full approval of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the leaders of the Army and Navy" to announce its so-called method of ending the disputes between Japan and the United States. It states that in order to eliminate the various difficulties between the United States and Japan and to prepare for the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference, it is necessary to resolve several important issues. For example, the United States should officially recognize Japan's special status in the Far East. In addition, and of equal importance, the United States should clearly declare to China, "You must resolve your disputes with Japan, and do not, as you have done in the past, look to the United States for assistance. If Japan does anything unfair or inhumane, the United States is willing to offer its good offices, but it is an illusion to expect us to accept your requests and take action. Because of the repeated declarations by the United States, China relies solely on American assistance, which has made the situation in the Far East increasingly complex and has hindered China's unification and consolidation." This document also states, "The attitude we have expressed should also be the guideline for the United States' policy towards Soviet Russia." In addition to its so-called fundamental views, Shiunso further demands that the United States recognize the puppet state of Manchuria, recognize Japan's control of the Pacific mandated territories, and allow a certain number of Japanese immigrants to settle in the United States. It also demands that the United States remove its naval and military bases in the Philippine Islands and convert the islands into a neutral zone. Some in the United States, in light of Japan's attitude, have developed a conjecture that if the Japanese government reaches an agreement with Soviet Russia on the Chinese Eastern Railway issue and can rest easy in Siberia for the time being, it will inevitably exclude all foreign forces in China and attempt to seize China's entire economy. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>(New York) News has come from Tokyo that the Japanese government intends to "define its policy towards China" and wants to bear sole responsibility for peace in the Far East, disregarding international law and the various treaties that Japan has signed. The *New York Times* commented on this matter, saying, "This move by Japan is an attempt to test the intentions of all parties." If Japan formally makes this request, then the signatories of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the countries with significant interests in China will inevitably rise up in opposition. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) A certain government inquired about Japan's opinion on the matter of international assistance to China. After receiving a formal oral reply from the Japanese authorities expressing opposition, and with the support of the press, people here are quite uneasy. Although political circles are unwilling to make any comments before receiving more detailed information, the general opinion is that the tone of the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is serious, and it will cause various difficulties in the international relations of the Far East. From one perspective, it is believed that the statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicates that future relations between all countries and China must be supervised by Japan. In addition, the general public believes that international commerce in China, guaranteed by numerous treaties, enjoys the benefits of the Open Door policy, and the League of Nations also has a certain understanding of China's sovereignty. Now that Japan is opposing international assistance, the Open Door policy and China's sovereignty recognized by Geneva will be harmed. As for how Japan intends to safeguard its position in the Far East, the Conservative Party's *Daily Telegraph* reported, "Japan intends to use armed intervention as a tool of intimidation, so that foreign countries will not dare to invest in China, because armed intervention will cause chaos and cause foreign investors to lose their capital." How the United States and other powers will respond after hearing Japan's warning is a matter of great interest. Of equal importance is the attitude of Moscow. As for Geneva, it will certainly not be able to turn a blind eye to Japan's opposition to countries investing in China under the leadership of the League of Nations. The Liberal Party's *Daily Chronicle* believes that Western countries cannot recognize Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine, stating, "The Monroe Doctrine held by Japan, in short, means that the interests of the great powers in this part of the world will henceforth be subject to and completely controlled by Japan's whims. Whether this doctrine is reasonable, the world can judge for itself, without the need for further elaboration. Now that Japan has clearly announced it, it is enough to cause inevitable disturbances, let alone anything else." (19th, Havas)</p>

Article 3 states that Soviet Russia guarantees that British packages, weighing no more than five kilograms, can be transported through Soviet Russia to any border, but according to the postal transport plan stipulated by the League of Nations in March 1933, puppet Manchuria is not included. From the perspective of diplomatic circles, the friendship between Britain and Russia has indeed taken a further step. (19th, Guomin She Dian)</p>

<p>Due to inconvenient transportation between the Roman Catholic capital and "Manchukuo" and the Chinese headquarters, various missions in the puppet state may temporarily enjoy a certain degree of autonomy. However, in reality, the various missions are still under the control of the General Assembly headquarters in China and the bishops stationed in the Northeast. These bishops are only temporarily representing the missions in their personal capacity to contact the "Manchukuo" government on religious affairs. This is only for the convenience of religious administration and has no political significance. It should not be considered that the Vatican intends to recognize "Manchukuo." (18th, Havas)</p>

<p>(London) Sir Arthur Salter, financial advisor to the National Economic Council of China, arrived here today and will go to Oxford to take up a position as a professor of political science. He made a statement on the situation in China, saying that domestic affairs have made great progress. Except for Sichuan, the infighting among warlords has stopped. Salter also briefly described the recent war in the Northwest, continuing that the National Government has been exercising reasonably effective power in various parts of China. There is a general and very firm desire in the country to eliminate civil war. From an economic point of view, the economic situation is slightly worse than when he toured China three years ago. This is due to the devaluation of the pound sterling, the rupee, and the Japanese yen from the gold standard, and the rising price of silver compared to foreign currencies, which has led to lower prices. However, economic construction in China is currently underway, such as the construction of highways, which the National Government deeply understands its importance. There has been some development in China's light industry, and if the current relatively stable political situation remains unchanged, significant development can be expected, especially in industries related to foreigners. Salter continued to talk about China's railways, saying that the future is quite promising, but there are causes for concern. Salter finally told the Reuters interviewer that he had written a long report, which would be published in both Chinese and English shortly. Salter has been a member of the British Economic Advisory Council since 1922, graduated from Oxford, and served as the head of the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations and the Secretary-General of the Reparations Commission.

<p>(London) The Chinese Purchasing Commission in Britain held its annual meeting here this afternoon, chaired by Ambassador Guo. According to the report, the commission ordered materials from Britain worth a total of 300,000 pounds in 1933. Since the establishment of the commission, the purchase of British materials has exceeded one million pounds, and the total funds of the commission are 3.25 million pounds. The report expressed satisfaction with the fact that Chinese students studying in Britain were practicing in British factories. Ambassador Guo stated that the Chinese government has appointed the commissioners to continue in their positions for another three years. Ambassador Guo also spoke about Sino-British cooperation.

<h3 id="e30">Obstacles to Naval Conference; Britain, the United States, and Japan Have Different Policies; Hope to Hold Preliminary Negotiations First <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to senior naval circles today, Japan's demand for naval parity and Britain's rush to build small warships are the biggest obstacles to the future of the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference. The Navy Department is holding talks on a shipbuilding plan based on the Vinson-Trammell Act's most favorable naval provisions. The above views were expressed during the talks. The talks decided to build smaller warships, destroyers, and submarines first, pending the results of the 1935 Naval Conference. The United States has now decided to reject Britain's proposal to reduce 40,000-ton dreadnoughts to 25,000 tons. Because of the strength of the British naval power and the suitability of its naval bases, this move would not affect Britain, but it is not the same for the United States. Because the U.S. naval power is not sufficient to patrol the defense line from Alaska through Hawaii to Panama, and the U.S. fortresses in the Pacific are the three places mentioned above. However, naval officials believe that the above problems can be resolved if the two countries can hold preliminary negotiations before the naval conference. Britain and Japan have both indicated their willingness to begin preliminary negotiations at any time, and naval experts from the three countries are already preparing. It is said that if the government's public works expenditure appropriation plan can be passed by Congress, the Navy Department intends to request an appropriation of $350,000,000 to build 20 destroyers and 10 submarines. If the plan is rejected by Congress, the Navy Department can lower its desires and only request $200,000,000. The Navy Department does not want to build or renovate its large battleships before the 1935 Naval Conference, because the United States firmly believes that in the future naval conference, regardless of how the ratio problem is resolved, it will strive to stipulate the size of the ships. On this important issue, Britain and Japan may unanimously oppose the United States. Japan naturally supports the construction of small ships, because this move saves expenses and avoids long-distance attacks by Britain and the United States. As for Britain's approval, it is easier to patrol its widespread naval bases if the ships are smaller and the number is greater. (18th, Guomin Dian)</p>

<p>(Paris) Japanese royalty Prince Kacho and his wife (the niece of Empress Dowager Setsuko) are traveling in France in a private capacity. They have been in Paris for several days and will stay in Paris for two weeks, then go to London for five weeks, and then travel to various European countries. They will come to Paris twice in between. Prince Kacho and his wife will leave for South America in August of this year, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, and then return to Japan via the United States. They are expected to arrive in Japan in mid-October of this year. Prince Kacho and his wife were received by President Lebrun and his wife at the Presidential Palace on the 16th of this month. They have also recently inspected two regiments of the French cavalry. They will also visit the Saumur Cavalry School soon. During Prince Kacho's stay in Paris, the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sato, will host a banquet for Prince Kacho and the French President and his wife at the embassy.

<p>(Harbin) Today, a Japanese armored train, driven by a Japanese soldier, drove into a trap set by people, and was destroyed by explosives. Everyone in the train was seriously injured, but no one died. Because bandits heard that two trains of Japanese soldiers were about to depart eastward, they buried explosives under the tracks 13 miles east of Hengdaohezi in advance. Unexpectedly, this armored train arrived first, foiling their plan. The Japanese authorities are currently searching for the bandits in the area. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, a train carrying a team of Russian workers and 80 soldiers departed from Suifenhe to clear the wreckage of freight cars destroyed by bandits on April 1. On the way, 500 bandits opened fire with machine guns and rifles. Most of the guards abandoned their weapons and fled. Fearing that they would be kidnapped by the bandits, the workers picked up the weapons abandoned by the guards and fought hard to repel the bandits, capturing three bandits. (19th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Since the British government issued an important white paper last night detailing the failure of disarmament negotiations, European countries are all uneasy and wary, and are preparing their military forces to await the arrival of the next great war. Universal disarmament is now almost hopeless. In addition to recalling Britain's efforts for the peace movement, the white paper also contains a disappointing note issued by the French government yesterday, namely, France insists on not allowing Germany to rearm, in other words, to implement the suspension of disarmament negotiations. After Lord Privy Seal Eden's tour of Europe, the documents exchanged between various countries regarding the British disarmament plan are all included in this white paper. (19th, Guomin Dian)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich will arrive here from Rome early next week, intending to make a last-minute attempt to salvage the current situation of disarmament. It is heard that Suvich's intention is that even limited disarmament is better than no disarmament. Suvich does not want to pursue the claims in Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's plan, but believes that if the British plan can be accepted by the public, it is worthy of Italy's full support. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) People here regard France's rejection of the British disarmament plan as a natural consequence of Britain's refusal to guarantee that it would not assist France in the event of a German attack on France. However, Italy hopes that disarmament talks will continue, because Italy is even more convinced that the memorandum issued by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in January can eventually serve as the basis for future talks between the four great powers. The Italian Prime Minister's memorandum expresses doubt about whether an agreement can be reached on not allowing Germany to dispose of armaments, and the question is how to prevent the disposal of armaments from exceeding the scope of the agreement. According to this memorandum, the Italian government believes that if there are conditions that can satisfy the public opinion of all countries, a convention can be concluded, and this convention should contain the following articles: (1) Abolish chemical warfare, (2) Prohibit the bombing of civilians, (3) Limit the military spending of countries not bound by the treaty according to the existing standards, (4) Limit the land armaments of countries not bound by the treaty according to the existing standards. People here now claim that the Italian Prime Minister is prepared to accept suggestions and amendments, as long as the basic principles of his memorandum are accepted. (18th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) The British authorities issued a white paper tonight, containing various official documents exchanged between Britain and other governments during the negotiations in the past two months. The most noteworthy of these is Germany's explanation on April 16 of its views on the British disarmament memorandum. It stated that Germany was prepared to accept the British disarmament memorandum as the basis for a convention with certain important amendments, and stated that Germany could not wait two years for a suitable method of air defense. Therefore, at the beginning of the convention, it was willing to have a short-range machine gun squadron for national defense, but bombers were not included. Germany agreed that its air force would not exceed 30% of the combined air force of neighboring countries, or 50% of the number of French military aircraft. Germany is willing to maintain this position in the first five years of the convention, but after five years, there must be increases or decreases, so that when the ten-year term of the convention expires, Germany can reach the same level as the major air powers. Germany is also prepared to agree to manage the storm troopers and other organizations on a reciprocal basis, so that their non-military nature can be proven by other countries' supervision. This management regulation must include the following provisions: these groups must not possess military equipment, must not receive military training, and must not be commanded by formal officers. Germany is also prepared to agree to other countries' disarmament being postponed until the end of the fifth year. According to the disarmament measures stipulated in the British memorandum, they would be implemented five years after the regulations have been stipulated. Germany also accepted other proposals in the British memorandum regarding supervision. Germany also continues to recognize the Treaty of Locarno. Germany believes that re-entering the League of Nations can only be handled after the disarmament issue, especially the issue of Germany's equal rights, is resolved. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet has decided to publish the documents recently exchanged between various countries on the issue of disarmament in a white paper. The general interpretation of this matter is that the cabinet's intention in publishing the white paper is to indicate that the negotiations centered on the MacDonald Disarmament Plan have now come to an end. From now on, the disarmament issue will be discussed in Geneva. Political circles are not very surprised by the French reply. Generally speaking, members of parliament show a hint of worry as the future seems uncertain. (17th, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Process of Anglo-French Negotiations on Guarantee Issues in the Treaty of Disarmament <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government's explanation of the implementation guarantee issue of the Disarmament Treaty, and its response to the British government's official document, was briefly reported yesterday by telegraph. Here are additional details on the recent exchange of documents between Britain and France regarding the disarmament issue, with aspects not previously covered in detail by earlier telegrams. After receiving the French government's response on March 17th this year, the British government sent a formal document to the French government on March 28th, raising several questions regarding the "guarantee" mentioned in the French response, requesting clarification. The next day, the British Ambassador to France, Lord Tyrrell, also raised three questions to the French Foreign Ministry: (1) reduction of France's own armaments, (2) benefits granted to Germany in the British plan, and (3) guarantees for the implementation of the Disarmament Treaty.</p>
<p>After receiving the British questions, the French government sent a verbal note to the British government on April 6th, briefly responding to the British questions. Yesterday afternoon, it prepared a formal document explaining France's views. In fact, after the French sent the verbal note on April 6th and before sending the formal document yesterday, the British government had also sent a note to the French government, raising two questions. This note was delivered to the French Ambassador to the UK, Corbin, by the British Foreign Office on April 10th, requesting him to forward it. The content included two questions:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the possibility of establishing an agreement on guarantees for the implementation of the Disarmament Treaty, is the French government prepared to accept the British memorandum on disarmament of January 31st this year? (Note: The main idea of the British memorandum of January 31st is that European countries must choose one of the following two paths: (1) Negotiate a treaty to have the most heavily armed countries abolish certain types of weapons; (2) If the most heavily armed countries cannot follow the first option, then a treaty should be established based on existing armaments, limiting any further increases. However, the British government wants to actively pursue the first method.)</p>
<p>(2) If France gives an affirmative answer to the first question, then please precisely explain what kind of guarantees France hopes to adopt for the implementation of the Disarmament Treaty.</p>
<p>The British note finally requested a swift response from France. After receiving this note, the French Foreign Minister supervised the drafting of a formal document by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff and had it reviewed by administrative and military experts with prestige. It was then delivered to the British government yesterday afternoon, which is the content reported in our telegram yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e36">The East Asian Neighbor's Military Buildup Threatens French Security; Germany's Return to Geneva Can Alleviate This Worry <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(London) Government officials secretly discussed this morning in the office of the Lord Privy Seal, Anthony Eden, the French note refusing the British disarmament plan. Eden has been a "salesman" for the British disarmament plan in recent times.</p>
<p>The French note is a response to the British note of April 10th. The British note asked (1) whether France is willing to accept the British memorandum, revised according to the suggestions made by German Chancellor Hitler to Eden, as the basis for the disarmament treaty, and (2) if willing to accept, what guarantees France requires.</p>
<p>The French reply asks the UK to pay attention to Germany's increase of 352 million marks in its land, sea and air force budgets, saying that this is proof that the German government is violating treaties and promoting rearmament in various ways to a degree that it deems appropriate. Germany's neighboring countries cannot ignore the imminent danger. In particular, many airfields have been illegally equipped in areas where military facilities are prohibited. At the same time, the German government would rather complete its paramilitary organizations for war purposes than abolish them or convert them to civilian use. This extremely serious behavior is enough to prove that the German government has intentionally or unintentionally made negotiations impossible, as the foundation of the negotiations has been completely destroyed by Germany's actions.</p>
<p>Therefore, before discussing whether an agreement can be reached on a way to implement guarantees that would allow the countries signing the treaty to recognize Germany's rearmament as legitimate, France must put its concerns about its own security conditions first. The text continues that Germany's return to the League of Nations would actually alleviate this worry, ending by saying that Germany's return to Geneva has been seen as a necessary condition to achieve a satisfactory way to implement guarantees. Eden's trip to Germany did not bring back a good solution on this important point, and hopes today do not seem much better than before. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">France's Attitude Is Firm in Opposing German Rearmament <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) France's attitude towards the disarmament issue has been consistent. This is the conclusion we have reached after reading France's reply to the UK. France also believes that Germany's reasons for wanting to spend 2 billion marks on military expenses are insufficient. Therefore, the French government believes that Germany's increase in armaments is a secret operation and refuses to formally recognize it. When Germany is determined to rearm, France can only bring the discussion on the disarmament issue back to a proper plan, in other words, to discuss disarmament within the scope of the disarmament conference and the League of Nations. Therefore, Germany's return to Geneva is of great significance, because whether the German authorities have good intentions and are sincere will be determined by whether Germany returns to Geneva. The French official document will inevitably cause a reaction in the UK, but the general public hopes that British public opinion will be able to understand the reasons for France's decision and also feel the need for agreement between Britain and France. As for the German side, after reading the French official document, they should be able to understand that the ambiguous policy has now ended, and that a clear and upright attitude may be the key to success. The French official document will definitely excite the countries of the Little Entente and Poland. In addition, the French government has taken this decision knowing its seriousness and deeply understanding the impact it may have, and believes that this action is for the welfare of the country.

<p>(Berlin) Wilhelmstrasse issued an official statement today, saying that Britain, Italy, and Germany are all pursuing a disarmament policy in a direct and active way. France's claim that Germany has violated the treaty is obviously a tactical move. The treaty contains many possibilities regarding armaments, which Germany has not used. For example, the treaty allows for compensation for scrapped ships, which is one of them. Germany has destroyed its heavy artillery and submarines, but France has more artillery positions and its fleet has increased repeatedly. Who is this directed at? (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) One of the major powers has now clearly expressed its opinion for the first time. The world's hope for regulated disarmament seems to have dimmed. The general public sees the French disarmament note as a clear and firm rejection of the plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. France now states that it is sincerely opposed to Germany's substantial rearmament, and that it is useless to pretend to negotiate disarmament. Therefore, everyone feels that Eden's suggestion that the main body of the Disarmament Conference should be convened on April 30th is no longer valid. However, the General Committee should meet as soon as possible. It is also believed that Germany's reaction to the French note will inevitably be severe, because one of the major powers has now spoken clearly for the first time, placing the responsibility for the current situation on Germany's shoulders. However, the general public still feels that the French note has not closed the door to understanding. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Labor Daily stated that the power to change the current state of disarmament still lies with the United Kingdom. Germany's military budget is enough to endanger security, not only for Parisians, but also for Londoners. The Paris Pictorial stated that if London declares that Britain is willing to assist France when France is attacked, then the crisis will not occur. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

Röhm said that if any country invades German territory in the future, not only the German army, but all the German people, even to the last soldier, will defend the nation. Some believe that Röhm's speech is a warning to foreign countries, implying that the National Socialist Party Army can not only maintain domestic power, but also be used to deal with international wars. Röhm continued, "If other countries illegally harm Germany in the future, our party army will inflict heavy damage on them, so that they know that what they have gained does not compensate for what they have lost. Although the embers of Marxism have not been extinguished, they have generally been unable to cause trouble." Röhm finally issued a warning: "Openly resisting Germany is suicide."

<p>(London) In addition to the publication of the White Paper containing the international disarmament memorandum, the officialdom did not express its opinion on the current situation today. London newspapers have shifted their attention from the budget bill to the disarmament stalemate. General public opinion believes that if there is no room for reversal in the French note, then disarmament will not be realized in politics. The Daily Telegraph stated that France's attitude towards Germany's demands is indeed the attitude of those who advocate French rhetoric, but legalism in the final solution can only be enforced by war. The Morning Post and the Daily Mail both welcome the new development and advise Britain to immediately increase its national defense capabilities. The Times stated that it is impossible to say that Germany's theory is unreasonable, because the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons is included in the draft disarmament treaty, and there is no evidence to determine that what Germany is currently doing exceeds this appropriate scope.

<p>(Berlin) German newspapers severely criticized France's disarmament note to the UK. For example, the Berliner Tageblatt stated that the French note does not contain the harmonious expression that the world is looking forward to, and is actually a shout. The British White Paper published today is intended to prove to the British Parliament and public opinion that Britain has worked hard to save disarmament, and it is not aimless. From this, it can be seen that the policies of Britain, Germany, and Italy on the disarmament issue have always been consistent, while France is just deceiving itself. According to semi-official diplomatic commentary, the French note intends to avoid the important and focus on the trivial, revealing the supporting problems of security guarantees, while putting the world's central issues of disarmament by countries with abundant armaments and the practical fulfillment of promises of equal armaments to Germany on the back burner. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers commented on the French reply to the UK, saying that it was using procrastination tactics, and that the French reply rejected Germany's rearmament. From this, direct negotiations seem to have ended. A semi-official political communications report stated that France no longer mentioned disarmament in its reply and did not consider the concessions made by the UK on the security issue. It can be seen that France has violated the principles on which the disarmament conference is based and has violated the Treaty of Versailles. As for Britain, Italy, and Germany, they have consistently promoted the policy of disarmament, which can be seen in the White Paper published by the UK. (Note: The British government will publish the documents exchanged between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy since the Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden visited various countries on the continent in the form of a White Paper.)</p>

<p>Rome After the publication of France's reply to the British note, the Italian side expressed surprise. People here have always believed that the UK's views on guarantees for the implementation of the disarmament treaty have gradually evolved, which may make France adopt a more appropriate attitude. However, judging from the recent situation, those who hold this optimistic attitude should be cautious. An Italian newspaper commented, "This note is almost an unexpected change in French foreign policy." Another newspaper said, "The recent abandonment of the unwavering attitude on both sides has been broken on the disarmament conference front, and the door to the arms race between countries has been reopened. As for us Italians, the French note seems to have great benefits, namely, to clarify the disarmament issue." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Milanese Italian newspapers unanimously criticized the French disarmament note to the UK. For example, the Italian People's Newspaper stated that the French note is just a tactic to make the UK give up its demand for France to disarm.

Whether this is due to the current administration's financial plan may be ignored for the time being, but the economic situation in the past twelve months has been very dynamic, and the whole country has shown a prosperous image, which is commonly seen by us. According to a report from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, agricultural income in February has increased by 20 percent compared with the same month last year. As for the situation in the industrial sector, there has also been great progress. Major industries such as iron, electricity, and railways are all showing an upward trend.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed Japanese envoy to India, Sawada, today to sign the first word of the Japan-India cotton industry agreement. The agreement is for a period of three years. Japan can import 125 million yards of cotton cloth into India without the obligation to purchase Indian cotton. However, Japan must purchase 10 million bales of Indian cotton as an exchange for importing 225 million yards of cotton cloth into India. The maximum amount of cotton cloth imported into India is 400 million yards. Any cotton purchased in excess in any year will be included in the account for the following year. Cotton cloth is divided into four categories, with grey cloth accounting for the largest amount, accounting for 45 percent. The next is colored cloth, accounting for 34 percent. A tax of 50 percent will be levied on all imported cotton cloth, according to the current tax rate of 75 percent. The agreement grants Japan the most-favored-nation treatment.

<p>(London) Imperial Chemical Industries of the United Kingdom has recently researched the use of the "hydrogenation method" to extract kerosene from coal. This method has been tested for a long time and has been effective, but it has not yet been industrialized. At today's Imperial Chemical Industries annual meeting, Chairman McGowan reported that the industrial production of oil refining from coal can begin at the end of this year. It is currently in the equipment stage and can already produce as many as 100,000 tons of oil per year. McGowan also said that the company's laboratory has been experimenting for seven years before achieving the results of industrialized production. In addition, what is noteworthy in McGowan's speech is also about the economic situation in the United Kingdom, which mentioned the competition of Japanese goods, saying that there are three ways to resist Japanese competition, namely, the effective organization of production, compromise with Japan, and stable currency. He especially emphasized the third point, hoping that the government would do everything possible to create a situation where exchange rates can be stabilized soon. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Li Yuankai Talks About the Yunnan-Burma Border Dispute <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Li Yuankai to go to Jiangxi for consultation on the Ban Hong incident. Li has returned to Nanjing. According to him, (1) when the incident occurred, most of the information was not accurate. His hometown is very close to Ban Hong, so he knows more details than outsiders. Ban Hong and Ban Nong are only 80 li apart. When the border was demarcated in the 27th year of Guangxu, five major lines were originally set, namely the so-called red, purple, and other lines. Among them, three major lines were demarcated at that time. The remaining two lines were one in the southern section, where Yunnan Province borders Annam, and one in the northern section, where Burma borders the Sichuan-Tibet area. (2) Yunnan Province has the most complex ethnic groups. The largest ethnic group is the Kata ethnic group, followed by the Hui ethnic group living in concentrated areas. Ban Nong is the Kata ethnic group, and Ban Hong is a local person from Yunnan Province. This incident was a conflict between the Ban Nong ethnic group and the Ban Hong local people. British troops were stationed, but not in Ban Nong, and whether the people of Ban Nong were instructed by the British to forcibly mine silver mines is not easy to determine. (3) The silver mine in Ban Hong Pianma, which is thousands of li long, is the best in the world. There are also many gold mines, followed by coal, iron, and other mines everywhere, and silver mines are the best. Most of the local people still mine by indigenous methods and do not know how to refine them, so the silver mined contains many impurities. If the mined silver is refined with machine furnaces, the composition will naturally increase. The silver mine in that area has indeed attracted the attention of foreigners. He was previously ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to go to Jiangxi to report in detail. Chiang Kai-shek ordered that when going to survey the border, the original central plan should still be carried out. After returning to Nanjing, he has repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The commissioners who will go to survey the border together are still being selected and will be selected soon. (5) The survey of the border is expensive, and the central government has not yet decided. Once it is received, they will set off. This time, they will only survey the border of Yunnan Province, including Ban Hong and other places, according to the original line, and then report to the central government for approval. As for sending personnel to measure and demarcate the border, it will be necessary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the British consul in Kunming and the British diplomatic commissioner in Rangoon, and then ask the government of that country for instructions before both parties can schedule a joint survey. (Special telegram, 19th)</p>

More than half of the political committee members have arrived at the temple to participate, and it should be established on schedule.

Moreover, the intentions of young people and princes have gradually become consistent, and past disagreements should be understood.

<p>(Nanjing) Control Yuan member Yang Rentian filed an impeachment case against Gu Renfa for dereliction of duty, stating that he recently read in the newspaper that Liu Zhuomin, the director of the Second Public Security Branch in Wuxi, Jiangsu, refused to be transferred and was shielded by Li Shuyun, the wife of the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Gu Renfa. Since Liu was so ignorant and incompetent, Gu Renfa, the director of the department, personally appointed him. His failure to investigate personnel carefully constitutes dereliction of duty. According to the director of the department, Li Shuyun and her mother also engaged in various illegal activities such as soliciting and accepting bribes, and eight types of evidence were presented. However, he did not report it until after the Liu case occurred, which shows his negligence of duty. Regardless of the content of the case reported in various newspapers, which is bizarre, the director of the department is responsible for his dereliction of duty on these two points alone. It is requested that Director Gu Renfa be transferred for disciplinary action to maintain official integrity. After being reviewed by Control Yuan members Wang Zizhuang and others, it was believed that Gu Renfa's improper use of personnel and negligence of duty were obvious facts and commonly known by the public.

<p>(Nanjing) Qinghai Chairman Ma Lin and others previously submitted a request to the Jiangsu High Court to approve Jin Shuren's bail for medical treatment. The court ruled that the request was rejected because the crime was serious. Now, Jin's wife, Chen Peilan, has telegraphed the court, stating that Jin's illness is critical. In addition to entrusting a lawyer to file an appeal against the court's ruling, she earnestly requests approval for bail for medical treatment. If it is still considered unreasonable, she also earnestly requests a clear order to be sent to the higher court for review. As for Jin's condition, she requests that someone be assigned to be responsible for it, so that if something unexpected happens, there will be someone to hold accountable (19th Special Dispatch).</p>

The opening fluctuated very little and mostly trended upward. After the opening, the trend was mixed, and the range of transactions was limited. Prices rose and fell within this range. Railway stocks were selling well, while gold mine stocks were loose. The stock prices of McIntyre and others fell from 2 pounds to 10 pounds. Yesterday, the Canadian budget announced a 10% gold production tax. This is the reason for the weakness of gold mine stocks. A production tax must be paid when the price of Canadian gold reaches 30 yuan or more per ounce. The strength of railway stocks is due to the expectation that the wage dispute will be resolved soon.

<p>Recently in the Soviet capital, there was a very unusual celebration. A group of Soviet aviators congratulated one of their colleagues whose total flight distance had been enough to circle the Earth twenty-five times. This navigator had flown over one million kilometers (kilometers), carrying mail and cargo without experiencing a single serious accident. There are ten such aviators in the Soviet Union, but their fame is known only to a very few. Only those who break records by flying thousands of kilometers immediately gain fame at home and abroad, while those who fly hundreds of thousands of kilometers in daily work are unknown to anyone.</p>
<p>However, this kind of daily work is filled with the essence of true chivalric novels. For example, there was one aviator who flew a light aircraft in forty-degree below-zero weather to several northern trading posts to deliver furs needed by the international fur market on time. Hundreds of navigators fly every day, either to rescue steamships surrounded by ice, or to transport goods to residents in the high mountains of Central Asia, or to patrol forests, or to deliver mail, or to eliminate locusts and mosquitoes, or to sow rice, wheat and hay, or to spread smoke over fields to protect them from frost, or to put out forest fires, etc. This has indeed greatly contributed to the Soviet aviation industry.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Birth of the Soviet Aviation Industry <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>But before such vigorous development, Soviet aviation had gone through a considerable stage. The first air route (from Moscow to Berlin, a total of 1,500 kilometers) was established in 1923. In the past decade, the progress of Soviet civil aviation has been rapid, like a thousand miles a day. In terms of route length, it now ranks third in the world (after the United States and France), but in terms of several special types of aviation, it already ranks first. At the beginning of the first five-year plan, the total length of aviation routes was 9,326 kilometers. During this five-year period, the routes increased two and a half times, reaching 32,000 kilometers. This year, the route length has been increased by another 12,000 kilometers. In addition, the Soviet Union has more than 10,000 kilometers of circular postal routes. Ukraine, the North Caucasus, Western Siberia, Central Asia, and other regions of the Soviet Union are covered with routes to transport mail and provide guidance for agricultural operations, etc. This year, the length of these circular routes is expected to increase to about 25,000 kilometers.</p>
<h3 id="e108">One of the World's Longest Air Routes <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Several of the current Soviet air routes, such as the Moscow-Vladivostok line and the Moscow-Tbilisi-Tashkent line, are among the longest in the world. Aviation plays a very important role in transporting urgent mail, goods, and passengers on important missions. In 1932, aviation transported 38,000 passengers, 700 tons of mail, and 2,000 tons of goods. Last year, these numbers increased greatly. Passengers increased to 55,000, freight transport increased by 170 percent, and mail transport increased by 385 percent. This year, Soviet shipping operations should increase at least double compared to last year.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Flying Over Deserts and Ice <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Aviation is most useful in sparsely populated and barren areas. In the desert and mountainous regions of Central Asia, and in the Arctic zone, aviation has achieved a landmark revolution. In some places in Central Asia, residents are completely unaware of what cars and automobiles are, but they know airplanes very well. In the past, it took months to travel from cities such as Tashkent or Samarkand to remote rural areas of Central Asia. Now, Soviet aircraft have connected these remote residents with central cities in one or two days.</p>
<p>Aviation is of great significance to the Arctic zone. Soviet aviators have also established regular relations with remote trading posts there. Soviet islands in the Arctic Ocean are visited by airplanes every year. Last year, Soviet aircraft flew as far as Wrangel Island six times.</p>
<p>The aircraft serving the Karsk expedition saves the country millions of dollars every year, because the aircraft can point out areas of "clear water" to the ships and guide them through the ice.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Dirigible Manufacturing Takes Off <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union started manufacturing airships not long ago, but it has already built several small airships (the largest with a capacity of 7,500 cubic meters). These small airships are just experimental models, a prelude to the future manufacturing of large airships. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also manufacturing training boats to train navigators.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's first medium-sized airship is nearing completion, and construction has begun on another experimental all-metal airship. During the second five-year plan, the engineering will be expanded to build a small squadron of airships. This squadron (to be named the "Lenin Squadron") will consist of seven large airships. Now the Soviet people are raising donations of 25 million rubles for the construction of this fleet of airships, and plans are being made to establish several airship routes to connect the central cities of the Soviet Union with the Arctic zone. The Effectiveness of Aviation in Agriculture</p>
<p>Soviet agricultural aviation ranks first in the world in terms of its work volume. This is not surprising, because the conditions for the development of agricultural aviation can only arise in the Soviet Union. In 1931, agricultural aviation began experiments with aerial sowing. In that year, only 4,000 hectares were sown. Two years later, this number had increased to 138,000 hectares. An aircraft can sow 20 hectares per hour, which is nine times the output of a tractor. In addition to sowing, Soviet agricultural aviation also performs a great deal of work in eliminating pests. Last year, aviation services were used on 415,000 hectares of land. In low-lying areas, aircraft can spray naphtha to eliminate mosquitoes and can drop other materials to eliminate other pests.</p>
<p>Agricultural aviation also has many other functions. For example, in winter, when dense frost is prevalent, only aircraft can create impermeable smoke screens. Aircraft can also patrol forests, prevent fires, take films of forest areas, eliminate weeds, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Soviet Civil Aviation is First in the World <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>In terms of aerial photography, Soviet civil aviation is already first in the world. Last year, films were taken from the sky of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Lena River Delta. Civil aviation on this scale would not have been possible in such a short period of time without a domestic aviation industry. The Soviet scientific aviation organization has made great achievements in careful planning. All Soviet air routes now use domestically produced aircraft, but three or four years ago, most of the aircraft were manufactured abroad. The quality of Soviet aircraft is now no less than that of foreign aircraft, and some models are even better than those abroad. The Soviet Union is a pioneer in the manufacture of all-metal aircraft and holds the leading position in the world.</p>
<p>The manufacture of aircraft engines is the most important part of the aircraft manufacturing industry. In this regard, the Soviet Union has also achieved great success. In 1930, only 12 percent of aircraft used Soviet engines. Now, the words "Made in the Soviet Union" are engraved on 90 percent of aviation engines. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Military Situation in the Far East (Vladivostok Dispatch) Preparation for Defensive Posture, Response to Sudden Changes <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The ominous dark clouds over the Pacific seem to have temporarily dissipated, but in a corner of the Far East, from the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River to the Tongjiang estuary, along the Ussuri River, a gloomy atmosphere prevails. Everyone has a sense that major and concerning events will occur in the near future. In particular, the movement of Japanese troops this time has further stimulated the nerves of the Soviet authorities. According to the information obtained here, the replacement of two divisions of the Japanese army is by no means a simple troop rotation. It has two very serious implications: first, to take advantage of the situation to attack Siberia and expand its power; and second, to find an opportunity to invade Inner Mongolia, extend its reach to Xinjiang, and implement the second step of its continental policy. Therefore, the replacement troops sent to Manchuria this time are the two largest divisions, Kyoto and Nagoya. Because the transportation in northern Manchuria has not been fully developed, the Himeji 10th Division, which excels in infantry and artillery, can only cope with volunteers lacking military equipment. To engage in international battles and compete with the Red Army, it is not enough. The Nagoya Division is equipped with a full tank regiment and more than 200 aircraft. These troops are concentrated in Heilongjiang, Harbin, Hailin and other places. Although they are not fully deployed, they are very active.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, which aims to maintain its national territory and build a socialist country, will certainly not ignore such military actions, nor will it casually relax its own military defense work. In the general state of the Soviet Union, ordinary people have no way of knowing the military situation, and foreigners are absolutely not allowed to know. However, based solely on what I can see and what is generally known, I will give a brief report. It is only clear to senior Soviet generals responsible for the situation how many troops are stationed along the Manchurian border and what types of units they are. Our estimates and general observations are that there are no more than 200,000 troops at most, and at least 140,000. The types of troops included are very complex, including assault infantry, crack cavalry, huge air force, with at least 300 aircraft, as well as chemical warfare teams and mechanized corps. A flight field near Vladivostok is particularly large and accommodates a particularly large number of aircraft. The aircraft also have a strong range and can certainly make round trips to Changchun and Fengtian without any problems. Even round trips to Tokyo and Osaka are not difficult.</p>
<p>The port of Vladivostok is more of a commercial port than a military port. In fact, it does not have any particularly remarkable facilities. In the reporter's view, it is not easy to resist the superior Japanese navy. However, they pay great attention to coastal defense. They are currently building strong fortresses. At the same time, twelve submarines are stationed on Russky Island. In fact, it is feared that the air force and the army will ultimately protect Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Judging from this situation, the war between the Soviet Union and Japan is truly on the verge of breaking out. Moreover, the two countries are historical enemies. The emotions of the general public and the current political system are very discordant. The final moment is always inevitable. Therefore, they are all engaged in active defense work and are deploying troops.</p>
<p>However, the current problem is that the Soviet Union will never cross the border to challenge, let alone turn to military offensive, so as to cause huge disadvantages to its own construction. If the Japanese Empire suddenly goes crazy and attacks Siberia or the coastal provinces, it will provoke a catastrophe. However, Japan not only contains irreconcilable contradictions in ordinary society, but also has many dangerous elements in its army, where they are fermenting. In particular, the army stationed in northern Manchuria is more susceptible to red influence. Furthermore, the anti-Japanese movement in Manchuria, although superficially latent, is even more solid and powerful in secret, making the Japanese Empire uneasy. Therefore, recently, it has shown signs of easing. The only symbol of this is its expression of acceptance of the Soviet Union's proposal on the China Eastern Railway issue. A meeting will be reopened soon to discuss the price and other issues. Although the future of the meeting may not be immediately optimistic, the pressure of the situation cannot but make Japan retreat slightly. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon after all, and the elements of war still exist. (April 10, 1934)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Recently, the Third Route Army, advancing from Nanfeng, Lichuan, and southward, successively captured Baishe and Jigongshan, located on the border between Nanfeng and Guangchang, and then advanced towards Guangchang. On the morning of the 13th, Fu Zhongfang's division, after departing from Baishe Town, passed through Ziling Mountain south of Luofang and attacked the bandits in the rain. At noon, Li's regiment captured the defenses of the bandit army's 55th and 71st units. Shortly after, Zhu's regiment captured areas around Liujiabao and Jiangjundu. At that time, a part of the pseudo-Ninth Army Corps and the pseudo-Fourteenth Division, guarding the blockhouses, stubbornly resisted with their defenses. After a fierce battle lasting half a day, more than a dozen bandit blockhouses were destroyed by the late afternoon, and many bandits were killed. The remnants of the bandits retreated in droves towards the mountains on the border between Ningdu and Guangchang in the southwest. The Third Route Army then recovered Ganzhu City. The headquarters recently announced Chen Cheng's victory telegram, stating that in the battle to capture Ganzhu, more than 200 bandits were killed, dozens of bandits were captured, six or seven heavy machine guns and more than 200 rifles were seized. The advance towards the south is still in progress. Ganzhu is a vital pass in the northern part of Guangchang, only a few dozen miles away from Guangchang City. Once the East Route Army arrives in Jianning, which borders Guangchang, the armies of Yongfeng, Le'an, Yihuang, and Nanfeng can advance side by side and capture Guangchang and Ningdu. (17th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Fang Zhimin's Red Bandits, with Hengfeng as their base, have been entrenched in the border areas of Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian for seven years, with Rao and Xin counties suffering the most. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially ordered the armies of four provinces to encircle and suppress them. Chen Tiaoyuan's troops moved from the Anhui border from north to south, and Yu Jishi's troops from Zhejiang Security moved from east to west, together with Liang Lizhu's troops, originally in Guangfeng, Shangrao, and Qianshan, and the garrison troops in Yujiang and Wannian, to form a four-sided encirclement. In addition to Commander-in-Chief Chen's arrival in Wuyuan, Zhejiang Security Chief Yu Jishi, accompanied by more than a dozen staff members, arrived in Yushan by Hangjiang Road train at 10 a.m. on the 7th. Acting Commander Chiang Wang County Chief and all circles welcomed them at the station, stationed at the headquarters, and inquired in detail about the local situation of bandit suppression and post-war affairs. On the 11th, all circles in Yushan held a joint celebration to express their welcome. All the security teams entering Jiangxi from Zhejiang have also completely arrived at their destinations, and the newly transferred and joined reinforcements have also been deployed. Chen Tiaoyuan, Zhao Guantao, Liang Lizhu, Tang Huiyuan, and others are all commanding in various places, adopting an encirclement and blockade policy against the bandits. The 21st Division in Shangrao recently captured the bandit lair of Xiangu Mountain in Shangrao. The division sent a telegram to the headquarters reporting victory, saying: "Xiangu Mountain is surrounded by cliffs on all sides, with only a small path in the northwest for people to climb. The bandits have built blockhouses there, and there are obstacles such as deer fences, which are extremely strong. The Shangrao Pseudo-Independent Battalion occupies the blockhouse, and the rest are on guard around the perimeter. Our 21st Division sent a team to suppress them, first defeating their guard team, and then encircling Xiangu Mountain. They launched a bloody charge along the small path, and after a fierce battle of six hours, they finally seized the mountain. In this battle, a total of 54 bandits were captured, and three bandits, including company commander Zheng Chongyang and platoon leader Cai Dongzhi, and more than 90 soldiers were killed. Thirty-one rifles, two carbines, two pistols, one submachine gun, and one air-pressure gun were seized." (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e115">Sichuan Bandits Launch Large-Scale Counteroffensive Fierce Frontal Battle Bandit Losses Heavy Tang's Troops Victorious, Now Confront Bandits Across River Chiang Kai-shek Praises Third and Fifth Route Armies in Telegram to Liu Xiang <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits, having failed in Nanba, retreated to Tongjiang. They were already at the end of their rope, but because the occupied area was shrinking and the defense line was shortened, the troop strength was concentrated. The bandits knew that the gain or loss of Tongjiang was a matter of survival, so they decided to stake everything on a single throw and launch a fierce counteroffensive. Liu Xiang's direct Fifth Route Army was their sole target, as this route had the thickest troop strength and sufficient arms and ammunition. The front was mostly high mountains and ridges, where bandits could occupy high ground and have the advantage. If this route were broken, the other routes would be easily swept away. On the 14th, the Fifth Route Army began to advance fiercely towards Luodingzhai, Niupanzhai, Qianqiu'e, Dashanbei, Mashikou, Jinlongtai, Datikou, Xin Genliang, and other places. The bandits also launched a large-scale counteroffensive at this time. Officers and soldiers fought fiercely with bandits, engaging in hand-to-hand combat on cliffs and precipices, charging back and forth, gaining and losing ground at times. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the officers and soldiers gained an advantage with the help of aircraft and artillery, but the bandit counteroffensive continued as before. Xu himself was stationed in Tongjiang and specially appointed the pseudo-military division commanders as supervisors, personally commanding on the front line. Those responsible for charging were selected cadres from Hunan and Hubei, all experienced and exceptionally brave. On the 16th, the bandit momentum weakened slightly, and they retreated across the Sita River to hold their positions. The officers and soldiers approached the river, but due to the fatigue of the soldiers, they did not launch a strong crossing and temporarily formed a stalemate. In this bloody battle lasting three days, both sides suffered heavy losses. Tang Shizun, commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army, telegraphed the general headquarters in Xuanhan on the 16th, reporting the details of the battle, stating that "The bandits facing us yesterday took advantage of our offensive to concentrate the majority of their forces and their main force, and stubbornly resisted and launched repeated counteroffensives, intending to seek another way out. When our various units attacked Luodingzhai, Niupanzhai, Qianqiu'e, Da'ekou, and Xin Genliang and reached the mountainside, the bandits launched a fierce assault, attempting to force us to fall off the cliffs. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers fought bravely, repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. After a day of hard fighting, and with the concentrated bombardment of machine guns and artillery, and the assistance of the air force, we finally recovered the various positions and occupied them firmly. At night, we ordered the various units to select elite troops and launch a night attack. Although the cliffs of Changyan'e, Jinlongtai, and Luoding Niupan were steep, and the ravines were several zhang deep, the officers and soldiers did not avoid the difficulties and finally occupied Mashikou, Fuxingchang, and Guanzi Ling at 3 a.m. At dawn, we pursued to the line of Changtan River, Yankou River, Kuzhutan, and Shuangtanzi, and completely cleared the south bank of the Xiaobei River. Currently, the bandits are confronting us along the line of Sitan River, Changtan River, Yankou River, Wangshui River, and Taijia River. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were captured, more than 200 rifles and more than ten White-Kerman machine guns were seized, and twenty or thirty supervisory officer and unit flags were captured. The bodies of bandits killed were scattered across the fields, and after examining the symbols, there were more than one hundred regimental, battalion, and company commanders and supervisory officers. The intensity of this battle was unprecedented in the various bandit suppression campaigns of this route. We are still continuing to cross the river and attack strongly. Tang Shizun bowed respectfully." Also, Liu Xiang telegraphed that on the 14th and 15th, in the battles of Luodingzhai and others, the bandits launched ten-odd assaults with cadres engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and the officers and soldiers suffered thousands of casualties, and the bandits were about twice as many. According to aerial reports, the bandits are still sending large reinforcements, continuously, intending to have a final decisive battle with the Fifth Route Army. There will be even more fierce battles in the next two days. Li Qixiang, commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army, and Tian Songyao, commander-in-chief of the Second Route Army, also telegraphed victories. Li's telegram stated, "At dawn the day before yesterday, hundreds of bandits attacked, and after our Li Zongfang's brigade bravely engaged them, the bandits collapsed and retreated to Longbeizhai. At the same time, Li Qingting's brigade also attacked the bandits in Jianshanping. After a fierce battle until noon, they broke through two lines of bandit fortifications, seizing a banner of the first battalion of the pseudo-270th regiment, thirty rifles, and capturing dozens of bandits. On the evening of the next day, the bandits attacked Li Qingting's brigade's position from Huangniba. We waited for them to penetrate deep, and ambushed them from three sides, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits, and they fled in disarray. This morning, upon inspection, there were corpses lying all over the ground, about fifty or more. This morning, Li Qingting's brigade continued to attack Jianshanping, but the bandits still stubbornly resisted. It was not until noon that the bandit position was broken through, capturing sixty or seventy bandits and seizing more than forty rifles. At the same time, Li Zongfang's brigade attacked Longchengzhai and is still fighting in Nanhua." Tian's telegram stated, "Our left column fought fiercely with the bandits in Yinlingshan, killing more than 300 bandits and seizing more than 100 rifles, and then occupied Zhenziba. The remaining 5,000-odd bandits all retreated to the left bank, and we dispatched Hu Yisheng's brigade, Zhao and Zhang's two regiments, and Luo Naiqiong's division's Xue brigade to join forces and encircle and suppress them, pursuing them to Rentoushan, killing countless bandits. The remaining bandits fled to Heishuitan and Lingshanchang, and are being pursued." Chairman Chiang, in view of the valiant fighting of the Third and Fifth Route Armies, sent a special telegram to Liu Xiang praising them, stating, "Your Third and Fifth Routes have made progress and have captured many prisoners. The officers and soldiers are fighting valiantly, which is commendable. We hope that you will instruct your subordinates to be even more diligent. Chiang Kai-shek bowed." (18th)</p>

<p>Magistrate Jin Tigan and local gentry jointly prepared and planned for three months, and the preparations have been completed. The surveyed length of the main and tributary rivers to be dredged reaches more than 36 li, and the cost is estimated to be about 60,000 yuan. The government provides a subsidy of 28,000 yuan, and the remaining funds are raised locally, with donations divided into two types: A, a special donation, and B, two months of rent, with landlords and tenants each bearing half. Donations are levied based on the estimated value of residences. The construction department of Shanghai Taichang Gravel Company is contracted to carry out the work, and the approval of the Construction Department has been obtained. The dredging process will start from the first and sixth sections. After one section is dredged, another section will be dredged in order to maintain the people's drinking water supply. A dam has now been built at Huayang Bridge to pump water. This river project is the first major project in Songjiang. Therefore, the commencement ceremony was held at 2 p.m. today (19th) at Dongchan Temple. Magistrate Jin, together with all the members of the River Dredging Committee and the directors of each section, attended the meeting. Representatives from the County Party Headquarters, various agencies, and newspaper reporters also attended. Magistrate Jin presided over the meeting and performed the ceremony as usual.

The transportation and sale of grain is related to the regulation of domestic grain, so the establishment of the bureau is urgent. Gu Xin, the chairman of the preparatory office of the bureau, accompanied Zhou Minggang, the director of the Grain Section of the Fourth Department of the Municipal Social Bureau, on the overnight express train to Nanjing yesterday afternoon at 11:00, and will then go to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the progress of preparations and request instructions on remedial measures. According to the Central News Agency reporter, Zhou, the director of the Municipal Social Bureau, said that in addition to requesting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to order all provinces and cities to remit the share funds of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau in full as soon as possible, he will also request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to order all provinces and cities to strictly comply with the unified collection of the foreign rice tax and will also visit the competent authorities in the capital to seek solutions in order to achieve this goal as soon as possible. The memorandum Gu presented to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is recorded as follows: "I believe that to save the rural crisis, the first priority is to prevent the dumping of foreign rice, and to prevent the dumping of foreign rice, it is necessary to unify the tax rates in Guangdong and Fujian. Therefore, the association has repeatedly appealed and telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and Your Excellency, requesting that the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian be ordered to immediately impose taxes in accordance with the current import tax rate on foreign rice. On the 10th of this month, I received a telegram from Your Excellency replying that it had been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for verification. It has been half a month since then, and the people of the country have been looking forward to it, but the Ministry of Finance has not made any indication. However, I have seen in the newspaper that the Ministry of Finance replied to the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce that the Guangdong Provincial Government must first agree to abolish the foreign rice tax before the customs can collect the import tax. In this situation, I do not know how long it will be delayed, and after the Fujian Province increased the tax last month, it was only one-half of the customs duty, and there has been no news of any further increase to this day. The leakage in South China has given the powers the opportunity to economically invade and dump foreign rice, causing the rice-producing provinces to hoard grain and seal it, prices to fall, the people to be exhausted, and the rural economy to be in a state of desperation. The people are in a panic and have no peace. The common people are mired in deep water and fire, saving the people from their troubles with a single hand, and ultimately putting hundreds of millions of living beings in water and fire. The government and orders of Fujian Province have long been unified, and it is easy to levy taxes in accordance with the precedents. Although the Guangdong foreign rice tax is related to the provincial treasury, the method proposed by the association can be adopted, incorporated into the customs collection, and the original tax amount can still be returned by the customs for the time being, which is not difficult to implement. The association is deeply disturbed by the urgency of the situation and urges Your Excellency to review the matter and order the Ministry of Finance to immediately increase taxes in accordance with the current import tax rate on foreign rice in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. I am eagerly awaiting your orders. Respectfully presented by Gu Xin, Chairman of the Shanghai Grains Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association, to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government Military Council."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Representatives of the Silk and Satin and Electrical Machinery Industries Went to Nanjing Yesterday to Petition - Regarding the Guangzhou Zhongxing Company's Detention of Domestic Silk <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association of this city are indignant at the Guangdong Central Company's detention of domestic silk. After inviting representatives of the Guangbang Silk and Cloth Industry, an emergency joint meeting was specially convened to decide to each send representatives to Beijing and Guangdong with a petition. It is reported that the representatives departed by train yesterday and first went to Beijing to petition. The petitions of the two industry associations and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Petition of the Two Industry Associations: "Respectfully presented, the trade associations have repeatedly received letters from members reporting that recently, domestically produced machine-woven silk transported from Shanghai to Guangdong has been identified by the Guangdong Zhongxing Company as foreign goods and required to pay a special tax and detained. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been asked to issue a letter of proof and request its release. After two weeks, the goods have not been returned, and more than 3,000 pieces of goods continue to be detained. As a result, the Guangbang cargo agents have sent telegrams to stop shipping and stop processing, causing terror in the domestic silk business. If we do not fight for it, the day of closing factories and ceasing operations may be imminent. Therefore, at 2 pm on April 17th, a special emergency joint meeting was convened, and representatives of the Guangdong Silk and Cloth Industry Federation were invited to attend to report the detention situation and discuss solutions together. It was unanimously agreed that the Guangdong Zhongxing Company was established specifically to collect special taxes on imported foreign cloth. Its purpose is directly to increase the import tax on foreign goods, with the intention of controlling through taxation. Indirectly, it is to promote domestic goods in order to change the psychology of those who love and use foreign goods. The law is excellent, and the intention is beautiful. However, the company does not do this but instead identifies and detains silk and satin, which are manufactured by domestic factories and meet the national product standards promulgated by the Ministry, without discrimination. This is a strong association and has become an obstacle to the development of domestic silk. It is even contrary to the government's intention to encourage industry and exempt machine-made foreign goods from taxes. At a time when the Ministry of Finance has early measures to abolish miscellaneous taxes and the Southwest Political Affairs Council has decided to have the provincial government order the Finance Department to thoroughly rectify business-run donations and taxes, the company suddenly detains domestic goods and imposes special taxes. I ask whether this special tax is levied on domestic goods. The types of collections compiled by the company can be seen at a glance. What is the crime of silk merchants? Who is willing to bow their heads and obey? If this matter concerns aviation education and talent training, (1) matters concerning how to instill aviation knowledge to the public, (1) matters concerning the establishment of aviation factories and the manufacture of airplanes, (1) matters concerning the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Article 1 of the draft regulations: "The China Aviation Association initiates and convenes the National Aviation Salvation Conference to assist the government in building the aviation industry." Article 2: "This conference is organized by the following representatives: (1) Each provincial and municipal government sends one representative; (2) Each provincial and municipal party department sends one representative; (3) Each provincial and municipal legal entity, such as chambers of commerce, trade unions, agricultural associations, educational associations, and banks or money industries, sends one representative; (4) The Aviation Administration, the Naval Aviation Department, and the Central Aviation School each send one representative; (5) Each provincial aviation agency sends one representative." Article 3: "This conference should be submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Commission for approval and ask them to send personnel to guide it." Article 4: "This conference establishes a presidium of seven to nine members, who are elected by the attending representatives and take turns chairing the meeting." Article 5: "This conference, in order to facilitate the progress of preparations, is handled by the secretariat organized by the China Aviation Association. When necessary, it may ask related agencies to participate in the preparations. Its organizational rules and detailed rules of procedure will be determined separately." Article 6: "The scope of discussion of this conference is as follows: (1) representative proposals, (2) proposals from provincial and municipal legal entities, (3) party, government, and military proposals, (4) ad hoc proposals." Article 7: "Proposals for this conference must be sent to the China Aviation Association at 132 Rue Lupan, Shanghai, two weeks before the conference's secretariat." Article 8: "The matters decided by this conference will be submitted by the China Aviation Association to the National Government for approval and implementation or sent to the provincial and municipal governments and legal entities for joint implementation." Article 9: "The round-trip travel expenses of the attending representatives of this conference will be borne by the dispatching agency, but the board and lodging expenses during the conference will be covered by the secretariat, and the methods will be determined separately." Article 10: "The venue for this conference is at the YMCA of China at 131 Boulevard des Deux Republiques, Shanghai, and the meeting period is tentatively set from June 15th to June 19th, and may be extended if necessary." Article 11: "The rules of procedure for this conference will be determined separately." Article 12: "These regulations shall be announced and implemented after being approved by the China Aviation Association."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Song People Telegraph Shanghai for the People's Sake Regarding River Dredging - Construction Costs are More than Three Times Higher Than Before; Abandoning Farmers and Workers, Contracting Outsiders; Local Officials and Gentry Collude, Citizens are Outraged <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>"To the Shanghai Songjiang Fellow-Countrymen Association, for your information. According to our Songjiang custom, when dredging the city rivers, each resident is responsible for the portion in front of their property. Those who have the strength provide labor, and those who have money pay the fees. The public needs are only for water wheels and dam construction, so the costs are low and it is easy to collect. According to the investigation of the dredging costs in the 6th and 14th years of the Republic, neither exceeded 20,000 yuan. This time, according to the county government's announcement, in addition to the 28,000 yuan of construction funds approved by the Provincial Department, there is also a local fundraising portion, requiring a large sum of 35,000 yuan. The two funds combined are more than three times the construction costs during the previous period when rice was expensive. The county government has not publicly announced the detailed budget and contract. Citizens have no way of knowing the secret. The county announcement only hopes that the citizens will actively donate and collect two months' worth of housing rent. The construction funds approved this time are all from the people's hard-earned money. Compared with the total construction costs of the previous two river projects, it seems that there is already a surplus. There are no wealthy people in Songjiang society; most are tenants. At a time when grain is cheap and hurting farmers and agriculture is collapsing, how can we bear to increase this extra burden? Moreover, Songjiang tried collecting housing donations during the January 28th Incident, but there was no detailed report on the total amount collected and the number of households. There is much talk that local officials and gentry are colluding. The Provincial Governor Chiang has strictly prohibited arbitrary levies and heavy taxes, yet the county government is brazenly disregarding this and carrying out searches and extortions again. I do not know that the provincial government has clearly ordered to use the labor of tenant farmers to dredge rivers. Even our old custom of Songjiang, where each resident is responsible for the portion in front of their property, can be implemented to the fullest extent. The fact that they insist on contracting to outsiders indicates collusion for profit, a smoke screen to deceive the citizens. Who will believe it? Songjiang has a surplus of labor but a shortage of wealth. They abandon the surplus and hire outsiders to plunder it. They do not cultivate the shortage but try to squeeze every last drop of fat from it. What is the mindset of those who are supposed to be the parents of the people? Zhuocheng and others have no choice but to petition on behalf of the people. In addition to telegraphing the provincial government and the Civil Affairs Department, we specially telegraph your association to telegraph the provincial government and various departments to thoroughly punish them and immediately stop the collection of donations in order to warn the corrupt officials and relieve the people's suffering. Songjiang is fortunate. (signed) Zhuocheng, Zhang Xiaofu, Bao Cheng, Xu Zhao, Xie Yiming, Wang Yufang, Xia Qi, Yu Yunding, Song Junyang, Wan Zaiyang, Kou Hao"</p>
<h3 id="e137">Municipal Land and Public Works Bureaus Actively Expand Hongqiao Airport - Deadline for Relocating Tombs is April 25th <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The expansion of the Hongqiao Airport in this city by the municipal authorities, as well as the purchase of land and the implementation of various works, have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now reported that the Municipal Land and Public Works Bureaus, because most of the graves and houses that should be relocated within the airport have not yet been relocated, hindering the progress of the project, jointly announced to the local villagers a few days ago that they should go to the Hongqiao Airport Office of the Land Bureau to collect subsidies and relocate all of them before April 25th. The text of the announcement is quoted below: "In the case of the expansion of the Hongqiao Airport, the Land Bureau has opened and attached detailed foreign lists of the land to be purchased and price estimates of the land, as well as the number of subsidies for relocating graves and green seedlings, and notified and announced them separately. The construction of the airport is now actively underway, but most of the graves that should be relocated within the airport have not been relocated. If there is further delay, it will not only hinder the work, but also after the rivers and small roads in the fields are filled and leveled, the ancestral graves of each household will be difficult to find. For this reason, it is announced that all graves must be relocated before the 25th of this month. After the deadline, the Land Bureau will order the local security to relocate and bury them on their behalf. In addition, the subsidies for demolishing houses within the airport have been surveyed and estimated, and each household should go to the Hongqiao Airport Office of the Land Bureau to collect the money. All houses that should be demolished must be demolished before the 25th. After the deadline, the Public Works Bureau will send workers to demolish them on their behalf. Do not wait and see and delay yourselves. This is announced."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Eurasia Aviation Corporation Adds Direct Route Between Peiping and Canton, Launching May 1st <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Eurasia Aviation Corporation's planned new routes between Peiping-Shaanxi and Guangdong-Shaanxi are well-equipped and were originally scheduled to launch in January. However, due to the unavailability of the Guangzhou military airfield for borrowing, a separate civil airfield had to be established, causing delays. It is recently heard that the company has negotiated to borrow the Shipai Racecourse as an airfield, and construction is nearing completion, with the launch imminent. Yesterday, a reporter specifically interviewed the General Manager of the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jingcong stated that the company had previously agreed with the Xinjiang authorities that the company's aircraft could resume flights to Dihua by January of this year at the latest, for international through transport, which was expected to be realized at that time. In order to enable direct access to airmail services between Eurasia and Europe between Peiping-Tientsin and Canton-Hong Kong, the company planned to open two new routes between Peiping-Shaanxi and Guangdong-Shaanxi and schedule them to launch at the same time as the resumption of the Xinjiang route in January. This would allow them to intersect with the Shanghai-Xinjiang route in Xi'an, to facilitate the transfer and transport of international airmail between Peiping-Tientsin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Canton, Hong Kong, and other regions with Europe, as well as domestic mail. However, the Xinjiang authorities repeatedly prevented the resumption of flights due to military instability, and problems also arose with the Guangzhou airfield within the Guangdong-Shaanxi route, leading to delays. Now, although the Guangzhou airfield has been relocated and built, the resumption of flights to Xinjiang is difficult to achieve in the short term. The company, considering that the equipment along the Guangdong-Shaanxi and Peiping-Shaanxi routes is already prepared, decided to utilize this equipment to expedite transportation between Peiping and Canton. It was thus decided to change the circuitous flights of Peiping-Shaanxi and Guangdong-Shaanxi to direct flights between Peiping and Canton, to shorten the journey and facilitate travel. This plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for approval.</p>
<p>The so-called direct Peiping-Canton route involves changing the original Guangdong-Shaanxi route from Guangzhou, via Changsha, Hankou, Xiangyang, to Xi'an, to a route that bypasses Xiangyang and Xi'an, going directly from Hankou to Luoyang. The original Peiping-Shaanxi route from Peiping, via Taiyuan, to Xi'an, is changed to a route that bypasses Taiyuan and Xi'an, going directly from Taiyuan to Luoyang. A through transport route is formed in Luoyang, creating a direct Peiping-Canton route. This not only drastically shortens the journey between Peiping and Canton but also reduces travel time and lowers fares.</p>
<p>Launching on May 1st, although the facilities at each station along the current Peiping-Canton route are already prepared, the company, to ensure all aspects are covered, plans to conduct another inspection of the facilities at each station. It has been decided to send engineer He En by plane this week to inspect the entire route again and has decided to officially open the route on May 1st. The Postal Administration and various stations have been formally notified to send mail and passengers.</p>
<p>Schedule for Southbound and Northbound Flights. The Peiping-Canton route will operate twice a week in each direction. Southbound flights will depart from Peiping every Tuesday and Thursday at 8:00 AM, arriving in Luoyang at 2:00 PM for an overnight stay. They will then depart from Luoyang at 9:00 AM the next morning, arriving in Guangzhou at 6:15 PM on the same day. Northbound flights will depart from Guangzhou every Tuesday and Thursday at 7:00 AM, arriving in Luoyang at 4:10 PM on the same day for an overnight stay. They will then depart from Luoyang at 8:00 AM the next morning, arriving in Peiping at 2:00 PM on the same day. At the same time, connections can be made in Luoyang with the Shanghai-Xinjiang route to Xi'an, Lanzhou, or Nanjing and Shanghai. Previously, traveling from Guangzhou to Peiping, Taiyuan, Luoyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hankou, Changsha, and other places required ten days or more. Now, it only takes one and a half days.</p>
<p>Stipulated Flight Distances and Fares. According to the company's measured aerial distances, Peiping to Taiyuan is 450 kilometers, Taiyuan to Luoyang is 350 kilometers, Luoyang to Hankou is 500 kilometers, Hankou to Changsha is 300 kilometers, and Changsha to Guangzhou is 600 kilometers, making the total distance of the Peiping-Canton route 2,200 kilometers. Passenger fares are set at 60 yuan from Peiping to Taiyuan, 40 yuan from Taiyuan to Luoyang, 50 yuan from Luoyang to Hankou, 50 yuan from Hankou to Changsha, and 150 yuan from Changsha to Guangzhou, making the total fare for the Peiping-Canton route 350 yuan. This fare is significantly lower than that of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route, as the cost of gasoline used in stations west of Xi'an on the Shanghai-Xinjiang route is more than three times higher than that on the Peiping-Canton route, resulting in different costs.</p>
<p>Large Aircraft Will Be Used. According to General Manager Li, the Peiping-Canton route will temporarily use the existing Junkers W.34 aircraft with 575 horsepower, so the journey from Guangzhou to Peiping temporarily requires one and a half days. To make flights between Peiping and Canton even faster, the company has ordered a Junkers Ju 52 large aircraft from Germany. It should arrive in China within three months at the latest. Once it arrives, this type of aircraft will be used. It is noted that this aircraft has not been seen in our country before. It is equipped with three 700-horsepower engines, totaling 2,100 horsepower. The aircraft's weight is 5,400 kilograms, with a payload of 3,800 kilograms. It can carry 30 passengers with exceptionally comfortable seating. The cruising speed is 230 kilometers per hour, with a range of over 1,400 kilometers. Once this aircraft arrives, Peiping and Canton can be reached in one day.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Reports of China National Aviation Corporation Plane Sinking in Sea Increasingly Confirmed; Seat Cushion Recovered Near Xunshan Yesterday; Reports of Fuselage Discovery Were Misinformation <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that after China National Aviation Corporation Flight 17 went missing, newspapers yesterday reported that the plane's keel had been found in the sea near the Seven Sisters Islands. The company immediately dispatched aircraft from Jiujiang and Wuchang to investigate. According to inquiries made by a Shen Shi News Agency reporter, the report of the fuselage being discovered is completely inaccurate. However, one of the plane's seat cushions was continuously retrieved from the sea. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>One Seat Cushion Continues to be Found. Three people dispatched by the company were led by fisherman Zhang Huixi, who found the wreckage, to continue the search along the coast of Jintang Gorge near Huangmang Mountain yesterday morning. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was received stating that a rubber seat cushion from the missing plane was netted in the sea off Xunshan.</p>
<p>Other items and the fate of the victims remain to be determined. However, based on the seat cushion and previously obtained mailbags, it is generally inferred that the plane sank into the sea, which is now almost certainly confirmed.</p>
<p>Report of Fuselage Discovery is Completely Inaccurate. Reports that the entire missing plane had been found near the Seven Sisters Islands are completely inaccurate, according to the person in charge of the company. Since the company offered a reward of 500 yuan, fishermen in the area have been actively searching and often making reports that are not entirely accurate. Yesterday morning, the company received a letter from the Yuyao Salt Affairs Weighing and Releasing Bureau stating that on the 29th day of the lunar month, fishermen saw an airplane descending from the sky in the sea off Xinpu. They intended to provide assistance, but due to the large waves, they were unable to do so. In a split second, the plane disappeared. However, according to the company's map investigation, there is no place called "Xinpu." Whether this is a misunderstanding is still under investigation. The discovery of the seat cushion today makes the theory that the plane sank into the sea more reliable, but it is still difficult to determine where it sank.</p>
<p>Board Meeting to be Held Today. In addition to ordering new aircraft from the United States, the company will hold a board meeting at 5:00 PM today to discuss future aviation safety issues, report on the loss of the plane, and sign the new contract for purchasing aircraft. When the two new Commodores arrive in Shanghai, the original Shanghai-Canton route can be fully restored. The company is currently planning to improve facilities along the route to ensure the safety of travel when flights resume in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Ministry of Transportation Stipulates the Number of Crew Members on Various Ships; Yesterday, the Maritime Administration Bureau was Instructed to Comply <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that because the number of crew members on various ships has never been regulated, leading to arbitrary standards, which is deeply related to the shipping industry, the Ministry of Transportation has recently formulated measures for the number of crew members employed on ships and issued a general order to maritime administration bureaus in various places to instruct their subordinates to comply. The Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau also received a notice yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Instructions. The Ministry of Transportation instructed the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau yesterday: "Upon investigation, the number of crew members on ships is mostly regulated by law in various countries in the East and West. Our country has not yet formulated such laws, causing the number of crew members employed on ships to be arbitrary, making management difficult for the competent authorities. The Maritime Administration Department of this Ministry has drafted a table of the number of crew members on ships and submitted it to the current meeting to promote the shipping industry for joint discussion. The meeting unanimously agreed to request the Ministry to issue a general order for implementation. In the future, all ocean-going, coastal, and inland river ships should immediately comply with the listed numbers and employ crew members. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the table of the number of crew members on ships is enclosed for compliance and to instruct your subordinates to comply. This order." It is heard that the bureau has already instructed various shipping companies to take note.</p>
<p>Number of Crew Members. The Ministry of Transportation's table of the number of crew members is as follows: (1) Ocean-going routes: For ships of 1,600 tons or more, there must be one captain, one chief mate, one second mate one third mate, one Chief Engineer, one first assistant engineer, one second assistant engineer, and one third assistant engineer. (2) Coastal or near-sea routes: For ships of 500 tons or more but less than 1,000 tons, there must be one captain, one chief mate, one Chief Engineer, and one first assistant engineer.

<h3 id="e142">Central Government Promulgates Supplementary Measures for the Organization of Shipping Associations <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to the city's shipping industry, inland river shipping industry, civil shipbuilding industry, coal and stone barge industry, sand ship industry, and other trade associations: "We hereby inform you that on the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China, stating that according to Document No. 6282 from the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Executive Committee, the organization of shipping associations should be based on the Trade Association Law of Industry and Commerce, which was previously communicated by the former Central Training Department. Subsequently, shipping merchants in various places submitted that the business nature of shipping merchants differs greatly from that of general merchants, and the general regulations for merchant organizations cannot be fully adapted to shipping merchants with special characteristics. In order to thoroughly remedy this situation, this committee, together with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Industry, drafted supplementary measures for the organization of shipping merchants and forwarded them to the Central Government for review and submission to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. Now, the draft measures have been resolved by the 399th meeting of the Central Political Conference to 'pass and send to the National Government' and were promulgated by the National Government on March 21. In the future, matters concerning the organization of shipping merchants should be handled in accordance with these measures and the Trade Association Law of Industry and Commerce. In addition to separate letters, we enclose a copy of the supplementary measures for the organization of shipping merchants for your information and to instruct your subordinates to take note, etc.' Accordingly, we enclose a copy of the original document for your information, etc. sincerely." The supplementary measures for the organization of shipping merchants are recorded as follows: (1) All shipping or civil ship companies and firms should organize trade associations and join chambers of commerce in accordance with the Trade Association Law of Industry and Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce Law. (2) Shipping or civil ships that have not established companies or firms but have formally registered with the government may use their brand name as a unit to participate in trade associations. (3) The area of shipping or civil ship trade associations, in addition to the provisions of the Trade Association Law of Industry and Commerce, if the routes of each company or firm span two or more provinces, counties, and cities, the company or firm should join the trade associations in each location where the company or firm is located. If the company or firm has head and branch offices, they should also join the trade associations in each location separately. If there are fewer than seven companies in the area, and those that have not established companies or firms may join the trade associations in the counties and cities through which the route passes. (4) The highest supervisory authority of shipping or civil ship trade associations is the Ministry of Transportation. In addition to matters concerning establishment, dissolution, and organization of association affairs, which should be submitted to the local government and forwarded to the Ministry of Transportation for approval and sent to the Ministry of Industry for record, major matters concerning shipping administration should be submitted directly to the Ministry of Transportation for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Ministry of Transportation Limits the Closure of Private Postal Bureaus to Within This Year; Reply to Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation replied to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association yesterday: (Omitted above) Upon investigation, the postal service is a state-run enterprise, which is a common practice in countries around the world. The postal regulations of our country also stipulate this clearly, and it is inappropriate to forcibly compare it with the examples of ships and railroads. The National Transportation Conference in 1928 resolved that "all private postal bureaus should be abolished uniformly by 1930." This should have been implemented on schedule. Later, because the shipping industry associations jointly requested a further delay, the Ministry specifically ordered the Directorate General of Posts to stipulate five temporary registration and licensing measures for private postal bureaus, originally intended as a comprehensive consideration to give the shipping industry the opportunity to gradually wind down. Since implementation, they have not followed the Ministry's intentions and engaged in winding down. Every time they are cracked down on, they jointly request delays. Such delays have been going on for several years. If this continues and strict measures are not taken, the postal regulations will never be fully implemented, and the postal service will never be unified. The Directorate General of Posts previously reported the situation of private postal bureaus to the Ministry. In order to unify the postal service, the Ministry specifically instructed the Directorate General to strictly order all private postal bureaus to gradually cease operations by the end of 1934. In addition, it requested the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to military, political, and police agencies in all provinces and cities to assist in the crackdown, to close them all within the Ministry's specified time limit and not to extend it. This case has been approved and ordered to be implemented. Since this case has been approved for scheduled closure, it is difficult to extend it again. We hereby reply to the previous situation in the telegram.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Ministry of Railways Explains Punishment Law for Passengers Carrying Contraband <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Two Roads Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday explaining the penalty measures for passengers carrying contraband. The text of the order is recorded as follows: "According to the request from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration Committee for an explanation of Article 16 of the passenger transport regulations for compliance, after investigation, passengers carrying dangerous goods, objectionable goods, or contraband should be handled in accordance with Article 16 of the regulations, depending on the severity of the case. For minor cases, in addition to a fine of no more than 100 yuan, the dangerous goods or objectionable goods may be returned to the passenger. If the case is considered serious or involves government bans, the persons and items involved should be sent to the competent authorities for handling. In addition, the phrase 'to the railway area or entrusted to the railway for transport' in the article includes the starting station, intermediate stations, and arrival stations. If passengers carry dangerous goods, objectionable goods, or contraband, whether at the starting station, intermediate station, or arrival station, in short, once discovered within the railway area, they should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the article. As for the phrase 'if losses or injuries occur due to carrying the above-mentioned items, the passenger must be responsible for compensation,' the meaning of the word 'carrying' refers to the passenger's luggage, suitcases, packages, etc., whether carried on their person or transported in the baggage car, are all items carried by the passenger and should be handled in the same way in accordance with the article. In addition to the three points listed above, you should immediately comply with them. The original text of the first half of Article 16 of the passenger transport regulations, 'Passengers carrying dangerous goods, objectionable goods, or contraband to the railway area or entrusted to the railway for transport shall be fined no more than 100 yuan or sent to the competent authorities for handling in accordance with the law,' should be amended to 'Passengers who carry dangerous goods, objectionable goods, or contraband into the railway area without authorization or hide them in luggage, packages, etc. and entrust them to the railway for transport shall be fined no more than 100 yuan, and when necessary, the persons and items involved may be sent to the competent authorities for handling in accordance with the law.' In addition to instructing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration Committee to comply, we enclose the original submission of the committee for compliance. This order."</p>

<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant has completed the construction of the Ninghai seaplane for the Navy's Ninghai warship. The damaged Jiangfeng aircraft will also be repaired. Additional factory buildings are being built in the open space in front of the plant to increase production. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ninghai Completed. The "Ninghai seaplane" used on the Navy's Ninghai warship has been completed since construction began last year. The fuselage is currently being painted and a test flight has been scheduled for the 27th of this month in front of the factory.</p>
<p>Jiangfeng Repaired. The Jiangfeng aircraft crashed in Fuzhou during a test flight some time ago and was transported back by Chu Tai for repairs. Only the engine was damaged internally. The cause of the damage was excessive turbulence. It is currently being repaired and is expected to be completed by the middle of next month. The pilot, aviation instructor Xu Chengqi, was seriously injured, but after treatment by doctors, he has gradually recovered. Once the Jiangfeng is repaired, it will still be flown by Xu to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Factory Buildings Added. Because the factory's location is small and does not provide enough space for work, the Navy Department has allocated 40,000 yuan to build a new factory building in the open space in front of the aircraft manufacturing plant. It will be 96 feet wide and over 200 feet deep. Construction has begun on driving piles and is scheduled to be completed in four months.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Tax Exemption for Peanut Kernels and Peanut Oil Transshipped Through Qingdao for Two Years; Implementation Begins Tomorrow to Save the Production and Sale of Miscellaneous Grains <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>European and American countries purchase a large amount of peanut kernels, soybeans, miscellaneous grains, etc. from our country every year. In the past, they were mostly transshipped from Shanghai for export. Since the fall of the Northeast, the situation has changed drastically. Soybeans, peanut kernels, and oils from the Northeast are no longer shipped to Shanghai, and the transportation rights are mostly controlled by the Japanese, which has a great impact on the late export industry. In order to save the miscellaneous grain export market, the Qingdao authorities have taken measures to exempt and reduce taxes. The details of this matter are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Control Miscellaneous Grain Exports. Before the loss of the Northeast, our country's peanut kernels, soybeans, soybean cakes, and peanut oil were shipped to England, Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United States, and Southeast Asia in large quantities. Most of them were transshipped in Shanghai. Since the September 18th Incident and the loss of the Northeast, these goods are no longer shipped to Shanghai, and the transportation of miscellaneous grains to Europe and America has been controlled by the Japanese. They have mostly switched to shipping from Dalian. Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, Kawasaki Kisen, Dalian Kisen, and other companies have dispatched ocean liners to directly transport them, not only reducing our country's tax revenue but also greatly affecting the export of miscellaneous grains from various ports in our country.</p>
<p>Harmful to the Production and Sale of Various Places in the Country. Soybeans alone have been seized by Japanese shipping companies at a rate of 400,000 to 500,000 tons per year.</p>
<p>And the peanut kernels, peanut cakes, peanut oil, etc. that Southern China, such as Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, has always purchased from the Northeast are also considerable. After the September 18th Incident, transportation was cut off, and Chinese shipping companies suddenly lost the transportation of this large cargo. Miscellaneous grain merchants in Guangdong, Shantou, and other places have purchased from Haizhou and other places to make up for the shortfall. However, recently, the Japanese puppets have a plan to sell soybeans, peanut kernels, etc. from the Northeast, on the one hand, demanding our country to open traffic, on the other hand, using Japanese ships to directly transport them to various places in Southern China and sell them at depreciated prices. This move has a great impact on the production and sale of miscellaneous grains in our country.</p>
<p>Qingdao Implements Transshipment Tax Exemption. Qingdao produces a lot of peanut kernels and peanut oil. Now, in order to save the markets in Southern China and prevent them from being seized by others, the Qingdao authorities have specially agreed with the Jiao Customs that peanut kernels and peanut oil shipped from the port and transshipped through Qingdao will be exempt from transshipment tax for two years from April 21. At the same time, the dock dues will also be completely waived, and the inspection fee for the goods will also be reduced by half from this date, all for a period of two years, to encourage exports. A notice was issued to all Chinese and foreign shipping companies that not only would goods transported to various ports in the country be tax-exempt, but peanut kernels and peanut oil transported to Europe and America from the area would also enjoy the benefits of tax exemption and fee reduction. There is now a large amount of peanut kernels and peanut oil stored in the port. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will dispatch ships to Qingdao to transport 15,000 packages of peanut kernels to various places in Southern China, and foreign shipping companies will also compete to change to Qingdao for loading and transporting peanut kernels.</p>

They were transported to Shanghai from Peiping some time ago.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Guild of Gauze Band Industry Sends Letter to Various Groups, Requesting Attention to Japanese Goods <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the Preparatory Committee of the National Gauze Band Factory Industry Guild, due to the recent discovery of a large quantity of Japanese gauze bands in the city, which has severely impacted the industry, convened an emergency meeting on the 13th of this month. As a result of the discussions, several methods were decided upon to distinguish between domestic and Japanese goods for users. For example, all factory members of the guild who are salespeople must wear badges when doing business outside, and the trademarks must be stamped with the certificate of domestic goods issued by the guild to avoid mixing with Japanese goods. Since the news of this measure spread, Japanese gauze bands have been closely scrutinized by various stores. Therefore, Japanese gauze band merchants, realizing that their conspiracy has been exposed, were greatly alarmed and immediately sought countermeasures. It is reported that they held a banquet at a certain restaurant yesterday, inviting shameless merchants and so-called "utilized" Chinese salespeople to design a plan to continue their invasion. In order to prevent them from implementing other tricks, or perhaps instigating treacherous merchants to change their brands, so that their cunning tricks would deceive the national goods organizations in the city and become members under false pretenses of being domestic goods, the guild sent letters to various national goods organizations yesterday, asking them to pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Ice Retailers Petition the City Party Headquarters Yesterday, Opposing Collusion Between Competitors and Japanese Merchants to Monopolize the Market <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Public News Agency reports that recently, Fu Zhiqing, the manager of the Japanese-owned Oriental Ice Factory, Gu Fuxiang of the Hygiene Company, and Gao Abing, Hu Huiqing, and Xiao Acai, among others, organized the "Xiecheng Company" on Hankou-Wallis Road, monopolizing the sale of all ice products from various factories, thus monopolizing the market and manipulating ice prices. The ice retailers, unable to withstand the oppression of Japanese merchants, organized a delegation to seek solutions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Industry Conference The ice retailers, in order to respond to the manipulation of Japanese merchants, convened a meeting of representatives from all ice retailers in Shanghai on the afternoon before yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than 100 representatives attended the meeting. Qiu Haitao chaired the meeting, and it was decided to petition party and government agencies, as well as the Chamber of Commerce and the Citizens' Association, and to issue a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Petition to the Party Headquarters Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Qiu Haitao, Wang Fengshan, Tang Abing, and others led more than 100 representatives to petition the City Party Headquarters. Zhu Longkui received them. The representatives' demands were: (1) to stop factories from signing contract agreements with Xiecheng Company; (2) to restore previous operations and prevent market monopoly. Mr. Zhu provided a detailed response, which the ice retailers found satisfactory before returning. It is reported that they plan to petition the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Association, and other organizations today.</p>
<p>Petition to Stop Collusion The petition to the party and government to stop the collusion stated: "Petition to stop collusion with Japanese merchants to monopolize the market, manipulate ice prices, vigorously oppress vendors, and exploit users; requesting prompt cessation to benefit sales." "We, the petitioners, are small-capital vendors in Shanghai who sell various types of ice. In the past, we operated with free competition, and although profits were small, ice prices were consistently balanced, forming a unified body of manufacturers, vendors, and consumers without disputes. Unexpectedly, the Japanese-owned Oriental Ice Factory (established by Japanese, managed by Fu Zhiqing), Gu Fuxiang of the Hygiene Company, and Gao Abing, Hu Huiqing, and Xiao Acai, among others, have been manipulated by Japanese capitalists to organize Xiecheng Company, which exclusively packages and sells all ice factory products, intending to monopolize the market, manipulate ice prices, vigorously oppress vendors, and exploit users. We, the petitioners, are unable to directly order and sell from the factories and unwilling to be oppressed by Japanese capitalists. Therefore, we request prompt cessation of all ice factories from entering into exclusive packaging and sales contracts with Xiecheng Company to benefit sales, avoid being monopolized, manipulated, oppressed, and exploited, and maintain the livelihood of the masses. This would be truly virtuous."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital on Guling Road, Ren'an Lane in the city, has been receiving an increasing number of male and female mental patients sent by various agencies for treatment in recent days. Although the hospital has seven buildings and more than 40 wards, it still feels insufficient. Yesterday, a Russian lunatic was sent by the Huishan Police Department. When he entered the hospital, he behaved stubbornly, tore his clothes, and acted ridiculously. After the hospital's doctor immediately treated him, his mind gradually calmed down. In the evening, when given rice, he refused to eat it, but when given beef noodles and bread, he ate heartily. However, since the hospital is entirely staffed by Chinese and the caregivers do not understand Russian, they felt it was difficult. Fortunately, Zhang Rongsheng, a cured mental patient from Ningbo who was sent by the Laoza Police Department on the 11th of this month, is currently staying in the hospital for recuperation. He used to work as a shop assistant and knows some Russian. Therefore, when the hospital treats the Russian patient and provides him with medicine and food, they ask him to act as an interpreter, which is quite effective. It can be said that there is nothing that doesn't exist in a mental hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Armed Soldiers of the Public Security Team in Zhabei Have a Conflict with Bus Employees Over Riding Without Tickets - Armed Comrades Have a Dispute with Bus Employees - Three Company Employees Seriously Injured, Arousing Public Outrage <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 5:00 PM, in the jurisdiction of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Seventh District of Zhabei,</p>
<p>A conflict arose on Xiangyin Road between soldiers of the Public Security Team and the Huashang Public Bus Company over the purchase of tickets. As a result, three bus company employees were beaten and seriously injured, arousing the public outrage of all the company's staff. They expressed that if there is no fair resolution, a strike may occur. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Issue Begins <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Huashang Public Bus Company's Route 4 runs from the North Station to the Municipal Government. After the route was opened, conflicts occurred from time to time with public officials regarding riding the bus, so it was temporarily suspended. At that time, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in order to actively promote the prosperity of the city center, issued Bulletin No. 53 on October 20, 1932, announcing that all military and police personnel, regardless of who they are, must purchase tickets in accordance with the rules when riding the public bus, in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and benefit the municipality.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Riding Without Tickets <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 5:30 PM, the Public Bus No. 4933 on Route 4 arrived at the entrance of the Animal Husbandry Company on Xiangyin Road. The company's inspector, Qian Yabing (a 22-year-old local), boarded the bus to check tickets.</p>
<p>At that time, he saw a soldier in the uniform of the Public Security Team without a collar badge who had not purchased a ticket. The inspector then instructed him to purchase a ticket. Unexpectedly, the soldier not only refused to purchase a ticket but also spoke harshly. The two sides were in a stalemate, and the bus stopped. Many passengers who looked like students rose up in protest and questioned the soldier, resulting in a conflict.</p>
<p>Conflict Occurs Seeing the group questioning him, the soldier became enraged and pulled the inspector off the bus. At that time, three soldiers from the same team happened to be standing there. Seeing their comrade being insulted, they all took off their waist belts and planned to encircle and beat Qian. Seeing this, another ticket inspector, Zhang Meilun (a 28-year-old from Xinhui, Guangdong), quickly got off the bus to protect him, but was no match for the four soldiers. Zhang's left eye and left arm were seriously injured. The nearby area was in chaos. In the midst of the chaos, Zhang Tingrong, an employee of the Municipal Government's Intelligence Department, happened to pass by and quickly ordered them to stop. Seeing the inspector injured, he called the nearby police and took both parties to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Seventh Department.</p>
<p>Second Dispute At the same time, Captain Zhou of the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Public Security Department heard the news and immediately joined the mediation, admitting fault and apologizing. Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another rose. When the last bus, No. 4932, on the route returned to the factory at 7:15 PM, more than 20 burly men wearing plain clothes and military pants blocked the bus. Huang Riguang, a timekeeper from Guangdong, happened to be riding the bus back to the company after finishing his shift. Without asking the reason, the crowd dragged Huang down and beat him severely.</p>
<p>Seriously Injured The second incident occurred at the entrance of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Seventh District. Seeing the situation was bad, the employee quickly fled to the sub-bureau for refuge but was pushed out by the guard, making it impossible to escape. As a result, his head and waist were seriously injured. Wang Shuyun (a 20-year-old from Taicang) and Zhu Azhao (a 32-year-old from Nantong), were also caught in the crossfire. At the same time, the company heard the news and urgently notified the Zhabei Firefighting Joint Association to send ambulances to take the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment first, and then to Renji Hospital at night. Among the injured, Huang Riguang and Zhang Meilun were the most severely injured. Zhang's left arm was broken, and Huang was said to have stab wounds. It is now reported that all the company's staff are very angry and have expressed that if there is no fair resolution, they will all go on strike to show their determination.</p>

<p>Pang Chunshan, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou residing in Shanghai, is 67 years old and has many children and grandchildren. He currently resides at No. 48 Changyun Lane, Xinda Gulou Road. Pang used to be the manager of the Gongmao Salt Shop in the city and accumulated considerable wealth. In recent years, he founded the Yongheng Refined Salt Company and resigned from his position as manager of Gongmao. In the autumn of 1923, when Pang was still working at Gongmao, he met Yao Lifen when purchasing diamond jewelry for his family. At that time, Yao was 19 years old and had exceptional beauty. Pang wanted to take her as a concubine, so he hired Zhang Mingshan, a salesman at Gongmao, to act as a matchmaker. Yao was very willing.</p>
<p>Devoting herself to service, she began living with him. Soon after, she became pregnant and explained the situation to her mother. Her mother, seeing that the situation was irreversible, did not obstruct her and allowed her to go with Pang. Pang treated her well, and they always went together when he traveled, inseparable. Although it was a white-haired old man and a beautiful woman, their love was like fish and water. Unexpectedly, it has suddenly turned to ice, and Pang abandoned her like a worn-out shoe. Yao had a daughter at a young age, who is now 11 years old. Having been abandoned midway, the mother and daughter find it difficult to make a living. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Pang Chunshan for</p>
<p>cohabitation and alimony, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay a one-time alimony payment of</p>
<p>10,000 yuan and a 5,000 yuan for the girl's education expenses. Yesterday afternoon, Shen Hong, a judge from the First Special District Court, held a hearing. The defendant was not present. According to the plaintiff Yao Lifen, "I am 30 years old, a local, and currently live with my mother on Xinzha Road. In July 1923, the defendant ordered Zhang Mingshan to purchase diamond jewelry from me, which I delivered. That's how I met the defendant. At that time, I was 19 years old, and the defendant was already over 50 years old. However, Zhang Mingshan, when acting as a matchmaker, concealed ten years of his age and based on what the defendant said</p>
<p>that his wife was dead, I agreed. We started living together first. It was in October that I told my mother about my pregnancy. We chose a lucky day and got married at Taihe Garden. At that time, my family sent out invitations for a banquet, but the defendant took no action. The following year, on June 16, I gave birth to a daughter at No. 48 Shanhai Pass Road. During my confinement period, the defendant still did not stay overnight every night. When I asked him, he hesitated and could not speak. Later, I was told by the landlord of the second house that the defendant had a wife and already had</p>
<p>children and grandchildren. Afterwards, the defendant went to Hubei and Sichuan with me. He gave me 70 yuan for household expenses every month, which was increased to 80 yuan last year. Starting in January of this year, he suddenly stopped giving me money, so I filed a lawsuit," etc. The defendant's representative lawyer defended the defendant, saying that the defendant's acquaintance with the plaintiff was purely for fun and there was no marital relationship. The girl can only be regarded as an adopted daughter, not his biological daughter. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that since the defendant treated the plaintiff as a plaything, it shows that today's abandonment is because he is tired of playing with her. This kind of behavior is truly</p>
<p>disrespectful to women and submitted a bunch of letters as evidence, saying that these were all letters from the defendant to the plaintiff, calling the plaintiff "dear sister," "dear concubine," or "dear wife," and even praising the plaintiff as a "woman of courage" and saying that he would "love her to the end." This not only proves that there is indeed a marital relationship between the two parties, but also shows the attitude of the defendant in the past, etc. Judge Shen then adjourned the hearing and ordered the defendant to be summoned for further questioning.</p>

<p>On Xinmin Road, Zhabei, behind Lanan Lane in Le'anfang Alley, an assassination occurred at 8:40 PM the day before yesterday. The deceased was about 50 years old, resembling a worker, and was shot by a thug with a handgun. The bullet entered the left abdomen from the front, hitting a vital organ, and he died on the spot, lying on his back in a pool of blood. A passerby in the alley saw this and reported it to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which immediately ordered patrol officers to rush to the scene to investigate and sent personnel to hunt down the criminals, vowing to bring them to justice. At the same time, the local Baojia was instructed to report to the court, which examined the body yesterday and reported the previous situation to the headquarters for record.</p>

<p>Yan Chongwen and Wang Xianian, police officers of the First Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, were patrolling the river on a patrol boat at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. When passing the Tai Mei Wharf on Lan Road, they saw a barge moored there. They immediately jumped onto the boat to check the passengers for smuggled contraband. They saw a woman in the cabin carrying a net basket, so they went forward to search it. They saw that the basket contained daily necessities such as toothpaste, but there were eleven oranges with dry, charred peels,</p>
<p>obviously purchased many days ago. They didn't know why the woman was still keeping them in the basket, so they became suspicious. They took one and examined it carefully. Suddenly, they found a small hole at the bottom of the orange. They smelled it and noticed a strange odor. They used their bayonet to cut it open and discovered that the inside of the orange was hollow and secretly contained heroin. They cut open the remaining oranges one by one and saw that each orange had the same small hole, filled with the above-mentioned drugs. They thoroughly examined the other items in the basket and found two boxes of cigars, but the middle of each cigar was also empty. All the tobacco had been removed and replaced with white heroin. There was also a tube of toothpaste, but what it contained was not toothpaste for brushing teeth, but the same drug. Then they searched the bottom of the basket and found four paper bags and nine cloth bags about a foot long, all filled with heroin. They detained the woman and took her and the赃物 back to the team, and transferred her to the Nanshi General Team. During the preliminary trial by Chief Zhu, the woman claimed to be Li Dongshi, 35 years old, from Sichuan. She used to work as a maid for the Mai family in the French Concession. The net basket was entrusted to her by Mr. Wang, whom she met on the ship, to take home and give to Mr. Mai. She didn't know that so many drugs were hidden inside and asked for forgiveness, etc. As the matter concerned the smuggling of contraband, she was ordered to prepare a document and, at around 1:00 PM yesterday, Li Dongshi, the eleven oranges, two boxes of cigars, one tube of toothpaste, four paper bags, nine cloth bags, and a large amount of heroin worth more than 1,000 yuan were transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yanjiaqiao Township, about nine miles south of Tangqiao in Pudong, has a Zhou Taiye Temple, built in honor of a former official of Songjiang Prefecture in the early Qing Dynasty who contributed to the farmers. The statues of the gods in the area are all dressed in Ming Dynasty attire, but this god alone is dressed in Qing Dynasty attire. This year, the temple fairs in various places have set new records. Therefore, yesterday, the farmers, merchants, and workers in the Tangqiao Dongjiadu South Wharf, Liuliqiao, and Yanjiaqiao areas of Pudong pooled their resources to hold a temple fair. There were full-fledged service teams, giant dragon and lion dances, colorful sedan chairs, and dozens of people with silver needles hooked into their arms, suspending incense burners weighing dozens of pounds. There were also young children with silver needles hooked into flower pots, not afraid of pain. At the same time, the Jiangbei Gang was mixed with Danghu boats, "Lake Silk Sisters," tooth pullers, fortune tellers, traveling doctors, as well as Indians smoking red pills and opium, Japanese, and volunteer army planes, promoting national salvation through aviation and revolutionary slogans at the temple fair, which was truly unique. However, the Danghu boats and Lake Silk Sisters, etc., performed all the way, seeming to be full of ugly acts. The route of the temple fair passed through the Tangqiao area and was completely traversed. From 9:00 AM to midnight, merchants and residents everywhere burned incense and lit candles, piously welcoming the gods. The business of incense and candle shops increased exponentially, so they all rushed to manufacture products day and night in the previous few days to meet the market demand. The residents of Shanghai, seeing that the grand event was rare, gathered in droves to cross the river and watch. Therefore, the townships and towns under the jurisdiction of the Tangqiao area of Pudong were filled with pedestrians jostling shoulder to shoulder, and the area was suddenly prosperous, as lively as a concession city. It is said that there will be a Yang Laoye fair in the area on the 21st, and the grandeur may not be less than this one.</p>
<h3 id="e160">A Lawsuit Involving a Dance Hostess - Prawn Soup Splashes on a New Dress - The Two Sides Fight and Meet in Court - Many Spectators, a Crowded Courtroom <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xianmei, a 25-year-old woman from Liyang residing at No. 27 He Ping Li, Avenue Edward VII, Public Concession, has been working as a dance hostess at the Lafayette Garden Dance Hall in the French Concession for six months. At 3:30 AM on the 9th of this month, Yang had just finished dancing and was sitting next to the dance floor when Pan Meiying, a fellow dance hostess (22 years old this year, from Ningbo, residing at No. 172 Xinxin Lane, Dapu Bridge), also sat next to Yang and was eating her large dish. Because she used the knife and fork too forcefully, the soup in the shrimp bowl splashed out, splattering on Yang's light pink crepe dance dress. This dress had just been made and was worn for the first night. Being splattered with oily stains, she felt upset and questioned Pan. Pan stubbornly refused to admit it and spoke rudely, and they quarreled with each other. Then, Chen Aying, a dance hostess in the same dance hall (23 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 5 Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road), came forward to help Pan commit violence and beat Yang, causing injuries to Yang's face, arms, legs, and buttocks, and losing her diamond ring, watch, jade ring, etc. She went to the accounting room to complain, but to no avail. Yang endured the pain and went home, and immediately went to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The next day, she filed a complaint with the medical examiner's office of the Second Special District Court, requesting an examination of her injuries. This has been briefly reported in the previous newspaper. After Yang's injury was examined, she hired lawyer Huang Xiubo as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court against Chen Zhongqing, the manager of the Lafayette Dance Hall, and the two dance hostesses, Pan and Chen, accusing them of joint injury, requesting that they be investigated and punished according to law, and attaching a civil lawsuit to recover the 300 yuan loss of the jewelry lost due to the injury. The court, based on the complaint, summoned both parties to appear in court yesterday morning. Both parties arrived with their lawyers and were questioned by Judge Sun Pengxian in the Second Criminal Court. First, he asked both parties about their age, origin, address, and occupation. Then, he asked, "What is the plaintiff Yang Xianmei accusing Chen Zhongqing and others of?" Yang replied that she was accusing them of injury, but Chen Cuqing, who was present, was actually mistaken. He was Chen Junying, the manager, and Chen Zhongqing was the accountant and had nothing to do with it. Chen Junying helped to beat and kick her. At this point, the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Huang Xiubo, said that since the name of the first defendant was wrong, he should be allowed to withdraw the part concerning Chen Zhongqing and submit a complaint to summon Chen Junying for questioning. The court approved it. Then, according to the plaintiff Yang Xianmei, "At 3:30 AM on the 9th, when the dance floor was about to close, Pan Meiying splashed soup on my clothes. When I questioned her, she scolded me and slapped me twice. Chen Aying came up to help and hit my arm. They went to the accounting room to tell the manager that I scolded them. Manager Chen Junying called me to the accounting room, scolded me first, told me not to come tomorrow, and then pushed me to the door and kicked me in the buttocks, causing me to fall to the ground unconscious. Later, I was helped up, and my diamond ring, platinum watch, and jade ring were all gone. I went outside, first to the police station, and then home. My face still has scars. I request that they be investigated and punished according to law." Then, the defendant Chen Aying testified, "I went to the accounting room to put on my coat. I saw Yang and Pan scolding each other. I went up to persuade them. Yang wanted to hit Pan but couldn't reach her, so she hit me instead. I really didn't hit her." The defendant Pan Meiying testified, "When I was eating shrimp, a drop of soup splashed on Yang Xianmei's clothes. I apologized to her, but she scolded me. Because it was a Sunday and there were many dancers, I didn't argue with her and went to tell the accounting room. Yang Xianmei went to the accounting room and slapped the table and scolded loudly. The accounting room told her not to come tomorrow. She slapped me, causing my earring to break. I really didn't hit her. Chen Aying was there to dissuade her. You can ask the Lafayette Dance Hall to investigate," etc. The official asked the plaintiff Yang Xianmei if she had any grudges against the defendants. Yang replied, "They never acknowledged me, so they deliberately bullied me." At this point, the official, seeing that the defendants were not all present, adjourned the hearing to the 26th for further questioning. Chen Zhongying's part was not accepted. The two defendants, Pan Meiying and Chen Aying, were ordered to be released on bail and await further instructions. During the trial of this case, relatives and friends of both parties, as well as the defendants' little sisters and rickshaw pullers, all came to the court to listen. The number of people in the audience was quite crowded.</p>

<p>Gu Jinyan A new wharf has recently been built at the Gonghexing Wharf on Broadway. At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, while it was being built, a worker, Gu Jinyan (23 years old from Haimen), and Chen Agen were carrying a box of cement together. When they carried it to the crane used to lift cement, Gu's clothes were suddenly caught by the machine, and he was lifted up with the machine, quite high off the ground. The machine loosened, and Gu fell to the ground and injured his head severely. The foreman, Qiu Ximin, saw this and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Phalen Road Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Diao Chengtang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to Chen Agen's testimony, "At that time, I was carrying a box of cement with the deceased. Unexpectedly, the oilskin jacket he was wearing was caught by the machine. I went forward and tried to pull him, but it was too late. The driver didn't see it at the time, so he didn't brake," etc. According to the deceased's brother, Gu Jintang, etc., Prosecutor Diao concluded that the deceased, Gu Jinyan, male, died from a brain injury caused by a fall. The body was handed over to his brother, Gu Jintang, who signed a guarantee and took it back for burial.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works considers Li Ma Road an important transportation artery in the Nanshi area.

The residents of the area have been notified to demolish and relocate according to the deadline. The Public Utilities Bureau has also been notified to instruct the Chinese Merchant Water and Electricity Company to stop providing water and electricity at the expiration date. The announcement from the Bureau of Public Works is recorded below: Regarding the project of reorganizing the first phase of Li Ma Road, the obstructing houses that should be demolished have been repeatedly announced and urged to be demolished. Later, at the request of various shops along the road for a delay, and considering the difficult times, the deadline has been extended repeatedly, resulting in the road construction not being completed yet. Now, the municipal government's Order No. 9079 states that this case has been decided at the 255th municipal meeting, setting April 30th as the date for compulsory execution, ordering compliance. Therefore, an announcement is made, urging all owners, shops, and residents along the road within this section to comply and quickly move and demolish before the deadline, so that the bureau can start reorganizing the road.

<p>The Shanghai Nanshi Office of the Tobacco Exchange Association is making tireless efforts to promote domestic cigarettes. In order to rectify and standardize market prices, it has requested various tobacco companies to set prices together. It sent a letter to the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association yesterday, stating: "Greetings. Our office has repeatedly received letters from many members complaining that the profits from selling cigarettes are meager, and business is difficult due to competition among colleagues. This time, the price drops and bonuses offered by various tobacco companies have not benefited our small stores, resulting in significant losses. It is even more difficult for retail stores to maintain operations due to the soaring foreign prices. Therefore, we hereby request your association to quickly seek remedial measures, promptly set retail prices, publish announcements for compliance, and maintain livelihoods. It is necessary to first notify the Chinese tobacco companies that all types of cigarettes must be reviewed and approved by our association if the market price rises or falls, with the premise of safeguarding the interests of door-to-door sales. After our association considers and determines the prices, they will be published in the newspaper. If you agree to our request, mutual feelings will be easily close, and both parties will benefit, avoiding misunderstandings and estrangements. In the future, if various companies have new domestic cigarettes to launch, and your association sends personnel to promote them, our colleagues should be happy to promote sales, etc. In addition to sending separate letters to the tobacco companies, we are sending a special letter to your association. Please investigate and reply with a copy of the letter sent to the companies for our reference in setting prices, so that we can print price lists and distribute them to all colleagues in the city for uniform compliance. This matter concerns the business of both parties, and we hope you will provide strong assistance. We are looking forward to your reply."</p>

<h3 id="e176">Further Hearing in the Gao Xiaochen-Tao Jiayao Debt Dispute Case <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Gao Xiaochen from Xuzhou, represented by lawyer Liu Cailiang, filed a lawsuit against Tao Jiayao from Jiangxi in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The case was heard again on the 16th by Judge Xu Shenjie in the Second Court, and the debate was postponed to May 1st. The lawyer Liu's defense recorded at the time had some discrepancies, so a further record is made below. The following is lawyer Liu's defense: The debt relationship in this case was transferred from the deceased Songhu Police Chief Xu Guobiao to the defendant. The defendant issued a promissory note as proof and paid interest for two years, which is an indisputable fact. The reason for the transfer, whether out of emotion or reason, does not need to be studied. What should be studied now is whether the promissory note held by the plaintiff, which was handed over to the defendant's relative Cao Boshan, was a fraudulent act. Whether it was fraud should be judged based on whether the Yuji Guangyutang share certificates, etc., handed over by Cao Boshan were completely true, and whether the meaning expressed was deceptive. Although these two share certificates were acknowledged by Wang Yaosheng, the general manager of Tongjisheng Salt Shop, a careful examination reveals that the 5,000 yuan Yuji share certificate is actually a temporary receipt of the shop, not a share certificate, which is already suspicious. Because the receipt was given on January 1st of the seventh year, while the 10,000 yuan Guangyutang share certificate was issued on January 1st of the eighth year, there is a gap of one year. Why was the share capital paid later? The stock has already been exchanged, but the receipt for the storage one year earlier is still in his hand, and he has not exchanged it. It can be seen that the defendant has not hidden the stock separately and deliberately confused the situation. That is, the defendant must have other entanglements regarding the previously paid share capital. Moreover, the later paid share capital has an interest payment booklet, but would the first paid share capital abandon its rights and never generate interest? Then, the defendant's use of the receipt as a stock certificate, and his concealment of the true facts, can be imagined. Even if we look at the Yuji invoice, the Tongjisheng Salt Shop is a partnership. According to commercial customs, the size of the shares and the rights and obligations must be stipulated in a contract agreement, signed by each shareholder, and each hold a copy as proof. This is a certain and unchangeable practice. Now, the defendant only has a stock certificate and no contract agreement as proof, and only the general manager Wang Yaosheng signed it. This stock certificate does not conform to commercial customs in essence, and it is difficult to recognize it as valid. Various loopholes cannot guarantee that it was not colluded with the defendant. Furthermore, concerning the interest booklet, from 1920 to 1926, the interest paid, except for 3,900 yuan in 1922, was 3,600 yuan in all other years. The so-called red interest refers to dividends and stock interest. The stock interest is either fixed at 8% or 1%, with a fixed interest rate. As for the dividend, it must be based on the amount of profit earned in the business as the standard for distribution. It cannot be the same every year. The interest paid on the interest booklet does not distinguish between dividends and stock interest, and it is neither more nor less, every year. In fact, there is no such coincidence. Moreover, according to the plaintiff's investigation in Tianjin at that time, the shop had suffered losses over the years since its opening and had never issued such high profits (this point will be presented after sending someone to Tianjin to investigate and verify). It can be seen that the interest booklet is also suspected of being untrue. If this booklet is considered true, the defendant has an income of more than 3,000 yuan on a 10,000 yuan share capital, which is more than 30%. The interest can also be said to be high. Now, the amount owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, excluding the 5,000 yuan that has been repaid, is only 15,000 yuan. The annual interest is only 8%, totaling 1,200 yuan. After deducting the overpaid interest, there is still a difference of more than 2,000 yuan. Even the most foolish person would be willing to sacrifice heavy interest to repay others. Based on the above, the receipt, stock certificate, and interest booklet are obviously untrue, and there is no concealment. Now, setting aside whether they are true or not, even if they are considered true, according to the letter from Wang Yaosheng, the general manager of Tongjisheng, this stock certificate is registered and he has a seal. If he wants to withdraw the capital and interest, Tao Guangyutang and Tao Yuji must be present to verify that the seal matches. Moreover, Tao Guangyutang is the name of Mr. Tao Xingru (the defendant's name). Xingru and his brother have been close friends for many years and have other relationships. Even if Mr. Xingru withdraws the capital and interest, we should notify our shop by letter, or contact us ourselves. There is no reason for others to handle it on his behalf. Even if there is a mortgage or transfer, it should be effective only after both parties agree and the name is changed. This kind of content and procedure should be well known to the defendant. The defendant knew that the shop was about to close down, and knew that it could not be transferred and the interest could not be withdrawn. He concealed the truth, falsely claiming that it could be transferred and the interest could be withdrawn. His act of making a false matter appear true and expressing it is called fraudulent behavior. The defendant used fraudulent behavior to cause the plaintiff to be mistaken, handing over the original promissory note to Cao Boshan, and took the opportunity to avoid debt and obtain illegal property benefits. He is obviously in violation of Article 363, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he filed a self-lawsuit and attached a civil suit, requesting that the defendant be punished according to law. As for the civil suit, he requested the return of the principal of 15,000 yuan, and 8% annual interest from July 1925 until the end of the execution.</p>

<p>At 8:30 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Zhang Rongxing brush factory, opened by Zhang Guirong from Huai'an at No. 10, Lane 7, Yuhou Li, Xuegong Street, Wenmiao Road, Nanshi. In a short time, the flames were fierce and broke through the roof. When the fire brigades of the West District and others learned of this, they quickly drove seven fire trucks to the scene. After the firefighters' best efforts to extinguish the fire, it was finally extinguished after about an hour. The fire destroyed the double-section shikumen house at No. 10 and spread to the single-section shikumen house at No. 9 next door, totaling seven households. The loss of property was quite large. At that time, the surrounding neighbors moved and robbed each other's belongings, causing chaotic order. The Second Squad of the Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to suppress the situation and investigate the cause of the fire. According to the second landlord, Zhang Ronggui, the fire was caused by Zhang Wang, a widow from Qingjiang, who went to the stocking factory to work, leaving only her two daughters, aged ten and seven, at home who started the fire while cooking. However, according to Zhang Wang, her two daughters had not yet gotten out of bed when the fire broke out. Neighbors rescued them, and their clothes were not even put on yet. According to some people, the fire was caused by workers from the brush factory upstairs. Rumors were flying, and it was difficult to determine the truth. In the end, the precinct took both the second landlord Zhang Guirong and Zhang Wang to the precinct and transferred them to the headquarters for questioning.</p>

<p>Ye Shaoyun, a native of Dongting Mountain living at No. 1, Renshou Li, Annam Road, French Concession, is 28 years old this year. Two years ago, he indecently assaulted Zhang Hanchun's daughter, Eryi Zhen, from the countryside, secretly conceiving a child. This resulted in the woman being returned by her husband's family two months after the marriage. The woman's father sued Ye in the Second Special Court, which sentenced Ye to one and a half years of imprisonment. The High Court of the Third Branch reduced the sentence to one year of imprisonment. It is heard that Ye still needs to appeal to the Supreme Court. Unexpectedly, Ye's misfortunes come in succession. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, at about 1:00 pm, he invited his friend Xue Boxian (33 years old, a native of Henglin, Changzhou) to his home to help boil lard oil on the sunning platform for floor cleaning. Due to excessive heat, it exploded and caught fire, and both Ye and Xue were burned. Ye sent Xue to Renji Hospital for treatment and turned himself in to the Southeast Hospital outside Xiaoximen for treatment. However, Xue died in the hospital at 0:50 am on the 18th due to burns all over his body and heat attacking his heart. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Corpse Examination Office to request the Second Special Court to send personnel to identify the body. The body was claimed and coffined by the affiliated company. On the other hand, the police station sent detectives, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, to the Southeast Hospital the day before to take Ye back to the police station. Due to the unhealed injuries, he was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police station sent Ye's case transfer form to the Criminal First Court of the Second Special Court. Police station lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case, indicting him for the crime of endangering public safety and requesting a postponement until the defendant's injuries have healed. Judge Tu核禀 approved the request for a postponement and will question the defendant when his injuries have healed.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: After reading your newspaper and other newspapers' reports on April 18 (regarding the Duck Industry Turmoil) and the Chicken and Duck Association's unauthorized change to the 37% foreign exchange rate telegram to various ports, suspending the shipment of ducks to Shanghai, etc., we believe that the aforementioned content is purely one-sided from the duck industry and completely obliterates the facts of the current turmoil. Upon investigation, chicken and duck merchants act as agents for buying and selling on behalf of customers, and regardless of whether the foreign exchange rate is large or small, or whether it is in full silver dollars, the amount received and paid by both the customer and the seller is the same. They only have the right to collect commission and have no other gains or losses. The reason for the current turmoil is that after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, customers insisted on only selling in silver dollars due to the difficulty and danger of transporting goods. The merchants had no right to stop this due to the customer-merchant relationship, the interests of the customers, and the merchants' rights. At that time, the duck merchants fortunately agreed, and the merchants even temporarily sacrificed not collecting commission from the duck merchants, so all transactions were in silver dollars, which has been the case until now, for less than two years. Although the duck merchants repeatedly requested the restoration of the 37% foreign exchange rate based on the conditions signed with the merchants at the Social Affairs Bureau, the customers understood that the duck merchants were seeking an unexpected benefit. There is also no precedent for using large or small silver dollars for purchasing goods in various places in Jiangbei, and the current economic bankruptcy and suffering of the rural areas is severe. Therefore, they are determined not to yield. Despite repeated persuasion from merchants and market officials, there was no effect. It is said that they have already filed a petition with the authorities. The merchants are in a dilemma, which has led to the current suspension of the market. As for the reason for the suspension, it was first announced by the duck merchants, who stopped slaughtering on the 14th and refused to buy ducks from the merchants from that day forward. On the 13th, our merchants had several thousand ducks, but because no one inquired about them, they have all been transported to the duck ponds in Pudong for feeding. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed. Moreover, after the duck merchants issued the suspension order, a fellow merchant, Weng Azhi, privately slaughtered seven geese and was punished. Therefore, the market turmoil was actually started by the duck merchants, and our merchants cannot bear any responsibility. As for the telegram to various ports to suspend the shipment of ducks to Shanghai, because the duck merchants have already issued a suspension order and refuse to buy ducks at all, and have also organized a disciplinary team to patrol the market, if we continue to allow customers to ship ducks in large numbers, they will have no way to sell them, and the resulting delays, deaths, and losses will be huge. How can we maintain this? The telegram to suspend the shipment of ducks to Shanghai was indeed a last resort for the merchants and was also a legitimate procedure. As for Chairman Zhao Songge's statement that he forbade the sale of 37% foreign exchange rates and that some merchants were willing to sell them, this statement is not worth a knowing person's laugh. This matter not only concerns the sovereignty of the customers, but even if the merchants have sovereignty, it is a matter for the entire industry and cannot be manipulated by the opinion of one chairman. Therefore, we have sent this detailed letter and respectfully request that your editor uphold justice and publish this letter for correction. The entire industry will be grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Shen Bao, Shanghai Chicken and Duck Industry Association, April 18.</p>

<p>(11) What is the explanation of "The dynamic consciousness sees the guiding role"? (Page 26, line 12)</p>
<p>Answer: This means that "the scope of theory is not only to record existing things," "the most important thing is to transform the world," "to guide action." This passage criticizes the errors of the Spark faction, saying that although they have worked hard to describe the struggle process that is happening before their eyes, they are clumsy in the theory of guiding action. This statement refers to the Russian Social Democratic Party. To say that the party's dynamic consciousness has a guiding role, in other words, "the party" must not only have a correct grasp of the objective reality, but also make an explanation and description of the Russian revolutionary struggle process that was developing at that time. "The party" should dynamically (not passively) realize its guiding role in the development of the current objective situation, that is, not let go of the objective situation in the slightest, and most resolutely develop this situation, expand the conditions that are beneficial to oneself, and ruthlessly overcome the conditions that are unfavorable to oneself, instead of watching the situation and making some abstract dissections and explanations of the objective situation. Furthermore, it means to grasp the reality in a process, and consciously lead to the arrival of another new stage, instead of mechanically or opportunistically catering to the development of the objective world. I wonder if you fully understand this explanation? Now let's give another example to help you understand this.</p>
<p>For example, the current national crisis in China is known to everyone. What is the current situation? International imperialism has broken the Nine-Power Treaty and has moved from maintaining China's territorial integrity to recognizing a "puppet state," dividing up China. Naturally, this is unfavorable to China. However, what attitude should a political party take towards the current situation? It is not enough to merely make some dissections and explanations of this situation. Nor is it enough to simply cry out loudly and sing a lament of anger and violence once and be done with it. It should use the contradictions between the various imperialist powers that have created the recent international situation to subtly and resolutely destroy the conditions for the united attack on China by the imperialist powers, transform this unfavorable condition into one that is beneficial to itself, and thereby lead to a new situation, making this conspiracy of division impossible. However, this is not a question of abstract dissection and speculation, but of actively, consciously, and clearly understanding one's own leadership role and bearing the determination to assume this leadership. There is a famous saying that "history is made by mankind itself." That's right, every fact in every historical stage is developing objectively, and at the same time, people can consciously change it. The current national crisis in China is certainly serious, but this does not mean that the Chinese nation has no way out. I hope you can understand this!</p>
<p>(12) What is "historical materialism"?</p>
<p>Answer: "Historical Materialism" is called (Materialistic Conception of history) or "Materialism of History" ("Historical Materialism"). Materialist dialectics is a general methodology that can be applied to all phenomena in the universe. Historical materialism is the application of materialist dialectics in explaining social phenomena. Therefore, materialist dialectics is general, while historical materialism is special. Society is a special form of objective existence, so it has its own objective and special laws of development. The special laws of social development are: the production of means of livelihood and the exchange relations of produced goods are the basis of all social organization; the fundamental cause of all social changes and all political revolutions is not due to human understanding of justice or truth, but is the result of continuous reforms in production and exchange. Therefore, the driving force of social development is the change in productive forces. Productive forces always play their role under certain relations of production, and the social economic structure, the foundation of social life, is composed of these relations of production. All other social life is built on this foundation, so it is called "superstructure," such as politics, law, religion, morality, politics, etc. In order to suit the development of productive forces, the relations of production are constantly changing their content, but when the development of productive forces reaches a certain degree, when the existing relations of production cannot match it, then a conflict arises between the two, and then a social revolution occurs, destroying the old relations of production and establishing new relations of production. And all the old superstructures, because the foundation has fallen, will also change sooner or later. According to the special rules of development of the social economic structure, history can be divided into ethnic societies, feudal societies, capitalist societies, and socialist societies.</p>
<p>(13) "They do not doubt that the Soviet Union exists independently of their consciousness, they firmly believe that in daily practice, the Soviet Union really exists, and the proletariat's struggle for socialism really exists." These few sentences are too profound, please explain them simply. (Page 49, lines 10-11)</p>
<p>(15) "They did not want to consider society as a material process that exists independently of human will." The meaning is not very clear. (Page 50, line 5)</p>
<p>(16) "To make them know that capitalist society is an objective material process." The meaning is not very clear. (Page 51, line 6)</p>
<p>Answer: The nature of these three questions is almost the same. Probably Mr. Xu is not clear about the fundamental concept of materialism, and that is why these questions arise. In the answer to question 9, we have already said some of the fundamental concepts of materialism. Perhaps Mr. Xu will understand after reading them. That is, materialists believe that the universe is composed of many materials, and these things exist independently of us. The 13th question, "The Soviet Union exists independently," means that this early socialist country is indeed a thing in the world and is not "their" fantasy. The 15th question is about the error of the "People's Party." The reason for their error is that they fell into the view of idealists and denied that society exists independently in the objective world, that is, the sentence you quoted. The 16th question is the same. The meaning of the sentence you quoted is that in the process of class struggle, the proletariat gradually knows that capitalist society is not the fantasy of a certain group of people, nor is it a theory, but it is indeed a thing in the objective world.</p>
<p>(14) What is "labor-moving class"? (Page 49, line 13)</p>
<p>Answer: The word "labor" is misprinted; it should be "labor" (勞).</p>
<p>After reading so many questions that Mr. Xu has after reading this book, we feel that you should not read this book now. However, dialectical materialism is something we should pursue, and we must not give up because of a minor setback. Therefore, we hope that you will read "The Modern Worldview" instead. Also, many terms cannot be looked up in dictionaries, such as the New Philosophy Dictionary and the Modern Language Dictionary. The above answers are also mostly excerpts from those dictionaries.</p>

<p>To establish national university institutes of science, agriculture, and social education. According to the decision of the Second Joint Meeting of the Boxer Indemnity Funds, the Ministry of Education will allocate British and American Boxer Indemnity Funds to establish national university institutes. It is reported that starting from the next academic year, three institutes of science, agriculture, and social education will be attached to national universities with relatively complete equipment.

<h3 id="e197">Key Points for Improving Education in Fujian Province: Report on Inspection by the Ministry of Education's Supervisor <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously dispatched Supervisor Tang Xifen to inspect education in Fujian Province. The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry. The following is a summary of the suggestions for improving education in Fujian Province:</p>
<p>1.  It has been found that educational funding in the province accounts for only 12% of the total expenditure of the provincial government, which is less compared to other provinces. Efforts should be made to increase it, taking into account the need to promote educational undertakings in the province, with the goal of reaching the standard that the provincial government's educational funding should account for 20% of the total expenditure.</p>
<p>2.  The provincial education budget should be divided into two categories: regular and temporary. After the regular expenses budget of provincial schools has been verified, compiled, and approved, except for using the surplus for equipment upgrades, there should be no phenomenon of using the funding for one class to operate two or more classes. For short-term provincial education projects and large expenditures for the construction and purchase of schools, a plan and estimate should be prepared separately before the year, collected for review, and a temporary expense budget table should be compiled, including a reserve fund item, which can be used to adjust regular expenses and prepare for temporary special expenditures. As for the monthly funding for provincial educational institutions, provincial and non-provincial institutions should be treated equally and paid at the same time.</p>
<p>3.  The regulations for subsidies to private schools in counties should be revised, emphasizing the equality of secondary education opportunities in various places, promoting the development of vocational and normal education, and supervising the improvement of the performance of private schools in counties. The subsidy methods should be formulated according to the following principles: (1) The distribution standard of subsidies: vocational schools must account for 50%, normal schools 30%, and middle schools 20%. (2) The use of vocational school subsidies, in addition to being designated by the department to enrich vocational equipment, may also be used to subsidize the salaries of vocational subject teachers. (3) The use of normal and middle school subsidies is limited to the salaries of teachers of major subjects. (4) Counties with fewer middle schools but excellent performance should be subsidized first.

<p>5.  Private primary and secondary schools must collect various student fees in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry.</p>
<p>6.  The private Fujian College lacks funds. In addition to provincial treasury subsidies and tuition fees, there are few other sources of funding for perennial expenses, which is not enough to sustain it. The organization of the board of directors is also unsound, school equipment is extremely scarce, and no achievements have been seen. It should be closed immediately or closed early, but no new students may be recruited in the future. The military training in the affiliated middle school does not comply with the Ministry's regulations and should be corrected.</p>
<p>7.  The private Xiamen University has relatively complete construction and equipment, and the faculty and staff are also working hard. However, it lacks funds, and the perennial expenses exceed income by 10,000 yuan per month. In addition to the 5,000 yuan monthly subsidy from the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance and the 2,500 yuan monthly subsidy from the China Cultural Fund, which should continue to be allocated as usual, the school's board of directors should quickly raise sufficient funds to avoid instability. The normal school department of the affiliated high school should be ordered to stop recruiting students and close down in stages to comply with the law.</p>
<p>8.  The funding for provincial vocational schools is still 7% less than the standard set by the Ministry. If secondary education funding increases in the future, it should be allocated to vocational schools first; otherwise, the funding for provincial normal schools and middle schools must be reduced and distributed accordingly. If the provincial vocational schools in the same location have the same departments, they should be merged. If the departments are not fully suitable for local production industries, equipment should be enriched, or the school site should be appropriately moved, or the school should be reorganized accordingly. The province's major production industries have shown signs of decline, but there is no vocational education to improve them. Vocational schools should be established immediately for industries such as fisheries, tea, and handicrafts.</p>
<p>9.  There are currently only two county-run vocational schools. In addition to the four measures formulated by the Department for reorganizing county-run junior high schools into vocational or normal schools, the following principles should also be followed: (1) Select county areas with fewer vocational schools in the province's current vocational school areas for reorganization first. (2) Counties with more than two middle schools but no vocational schools should be reorganized first. (3) Counties with special major production but no vocational schools to improve them should be reorganized first.</p>
<p>10. Provincial normal school districts should be handled with reference to the following principles: (1) Each district should establish one normal school, one rural normal school, or one simple rural normal school. (2) If there are two or more schools of a normal nature in the same district, they must be established separately. (3) Districts with underdeveloped primary education and fewer large cities should establish rural or simple rural normal schools first. (4) Normal schools should be established independently. The normal school departments or classes attached to them should be independent immediately. (5) Each provincial normal school must have an affiliated primary school and run short-term primary school classes, two-part systems, or single-grade classes for teaching practice. (6) Provincial normal schools must enroll students from each county in the district according to a quota, taking into account the results. (7) The Provincial Department of Education should designate normal schools in each district to run summer training classes for primary school teachers to seek further education for primary school teachers.</p>
<p>11. Provincial middle school districts should be re-divided with reference to the following measures: (1) According to the principles set by the Ministry, "Senior high schools should be concentrated in several central locations. If there are two senior high school classes in the same location, the senior high school classes should be merged and established separately." and follow the normal vocational school district method, using the old Daoshu as the provincial senior high school district. (2) For the provincial junior high school, if there are many classes, for the convenience of management and training, a girls' junior high school should be established separately or the girls' high school classes should be merged into a girls' high school.</p>
<p>12. There are a total of nine provincial primary schools, which have been taken over by local education administrative agencies since the 23rd year, until the 25th year.</p>
<p>All provincial primary schools have been completely reorganized, and the original funding has been redistributed to run short-term compulsory education, and should be handled with reference to the following principles: (1) Provincial short-term compulsory education is to demonstrate quality and can set up one to several short-term compulsory primary schools in a county or district, and set up one instructor to guide it. (2) Counties and cities that have set up compulsory education experimental areas and short-term compulsory education experimental areas do not need to set up provincial short-term compulsory primary schools. (3) The location of the school should be chosen where there are more out-of-school children and no affiliated primary schools of various normal schools.</p>
<p>13. The use of the primary school subsidy funds allocated by the Department of Finance to each county must be distributed according to the following principles: (1) The use of subsidies is limited to compulsory education. (2) The distribution of subsidies to each school must be limited to the payment of salaries to qualified full-time teachers. (3) Counties that have not held compulsory education or have no qualified full-time teachers may have their subsidies retained by the Department of Education.</p>
<p>14. The use of the primary school subsidy funds allocated by the salt fund must be distributed according to the following principles: (1) The use of subsidies is limited to private junior primary schools and primary schools for the blind, deaf, and orphans. (2) The subsidized private schools must be truly excellent in performance, have financial difficulties, and have been verified and qualified. (3) Subsidies to private junior primary schools must pay attention to the distribution of their regions.</p>
<p>15. The Fuzhou Provincial Public School should be taken over by the Literacy Education Committee, and its original funding, together with the funding to subsidize public schools in various counties, should be redistributed to seek universality.</p>

The following is a description of the game:</p>
<p>St. John's Took the Lead At the start, people crowded together. In the beginning, the game was unfamiliar to the team, and many tests did not succeed, and they inevitably felt flustered. Xu Wenkui and Zhou Xuexian, the left and right generals of St. John's, took the opportunity to advance, succeeding in one and then another, creating a priority situation of eight to zero. The China team then counterattacked. Duan Zhuo was unwilling to show weakness, and Zhao Zhenji followed, so they gradually caught up, eight to four, eleven to seven, and finally made it fifteen each. In the first half, St. John's scored another goal, leading by two points with seventeen to fifteen. China College Came From Behind St. John's led all the way in the first half. In the second half, after each team scored one point from the penalty, at this time, the China team's offensive became more intense. Zhang Yucai saw the middle road was empty and launched a large-scale attack. His cooperation with Duan Zhuo scored ten points in a row, reversing to exceed 26 to 18. From then on, St. John's lost. The China team, on the other hand, had a smooth journey. St. John's was not as strong as China College, and under Wang Kanruo's defense, the defense line gradually became chaotic, eventually becoming a follower situation. As a result, the China team won with a score of 44 to 30.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Current State of Secondary Education in England (Part 2) (5) Examinations <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenrou</p>
<p>The goal of every British secondary school student upon enrollment is not graduation, but to pass the graduation examination. This examination is not administered by the school itself, but by an external organization (usually a university). This fundamental examination is called the Ordinary School Certificate, and it is as difficult as the university entrance examinations in other countries.</p>
<p>Every student taking the London University Ordinary School Certificate at the age of sixteen who passes the examination in five designated subjects can obtain a certificate of passing. This certificate is kept by the Ministry of Education and serves as the student's qualification for entering university or is accepted by various other professions as a substitute for their required professional examinations. Furthermore, this certificate is also an essential requirement for students who wish to work in banks, insurance companies, or other commercial sectors. Therefore, every student strives to obtain this certificate before leaving school.</p>
<p>(6) Enrollment</p>
<p>The average number of students enrolled in each secondary school in London is approximately four hundred and twenty-five. No secondary school enrolls more than one thousand students, although one secondary school has enrolled nine hundred. The standard enrollment quota is four hundred and fifty students. If this number is exceeded, the school authorities believe that the essential element of education—individual guidance—loses its effectiveness. Each school authority believes that teachers should personally provide individual guidance to each student, and at the same time, a friendly attitude and a spirit of continuous mutual discussion should be cultivated between teachers and students. This is a characteristic of secondary education in England.</p>
<p>In British education, social relationships and personal contact are considered particularly important. Restrictions are not only placed on students in the classroom, but also on group meals. For example, at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, all students must have at least one group meal a day; some universities even require two. Any student can choose not to live on campus, and breakfast and dinner are also optional, but lunch must be eaten together on campus. All British secondary schools have excellent dining hall facilities specifically for student group lunches. Some students bring lunch from home, and the school rents out bowls and utensils for a small fee. Other students' lunches are provided by the school, and the menu includes pork, bread, butter, milk, tea, and fruit, costing about nine pence per person. In central schools, the cost is only seven pence per person.</p>
<p>(7) School Calendar</p>
<p>In London, the number of school days per year is approximately forty-four weeks for primary schools, but only thirty-nine weeks are stipulated for secondary schools. These thirty-nine weeks are divided into three terms, each lasting three weeks. As for the remaining holidays, they are freely determined by the principal of each school, and no one may interfere. The most amusing point is that the central education authorities are often vaguely unaware of the dates and lengths of spring break or other holidays within each secondary school, because the holidays of each secondary school are not uniform.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Therefore, in these short few minutes, on this row of imperial trains ready to depart, although black smoke was similarly billowing from the chimneys and steam was similarly filling the boilers, not a single person was on board to attend to them; it was not until the Empress Dowager was settled in her own carriage that these stokers and drivers were able to climb up from the ground, return to their fixed positions, and await the order to depart.</p>
<p>During the twenty-odd days before we prepared to depart, we don't know how many difficulties arose, leaving Qing Shan almost exhausted! The first difficult problem was the train's crew... because the Empress Dowager insisted on having the eunuchs</p>
<p>take charge of the train's affairs, but how could that be done? Although most of the eunuchs had served in the palace for many years and were fully capable of serving as butlers or maids in ordinary families, they had never received any basic railway knowledge; how could they operate a train?</p>
<p>Qing Shan spent a great deal of effort persuading her to abandon this preconceived notion; but she finally firmly instructed that, in any case, no railway workers were allowed to come within her sight. This showed that she was still adhering to the ancient</p>
<p>dictum of not using men to serve her!</p>
<p>This problem was thus resolved, but other matters were not so easily dealt with. One of the most laughable was the Empress Dowager's firm command to Qing Shan to instruct all the train's crew, from the driver to the lowest-ranking cleaner, to all wear court boots, don court hats, and dress up as complete eunuchs.

<h3 id="e224">A Scene <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Chonghua</p>
<p>In the time before the movie starts, the movie theater displays a special social scene. For a small dispute, they argue without giving way to each other, as if the Chinese people are very spirited and absolutely cannot tolerate any bullying. This time, a student, for the sake of a seat, argued with a soldier in uniform. The student said: "This is my seat."</p>
<p>The soldier said: "What proof do you have?"</p>
<p>Thus, an ugly look gradually appeared on both sides' faces. The air in the movie theater suddenly became tense, and people stood up one by one to watch the excitement. The student certainly wanted to take advantage of this to show off completely in front of the public, and the soldier certainly did not want to appear as a weakling in front of so many people and step down in this way.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, suddenly there was a voice... "Don't quarrel! Are you Chinese?"</p>
<p>Turning their heads in surprise, it was a child who said it, still playing with orange peels in his hand.</p>
<p>I don't know if they didn't understand these words or if they disdained listening to the child's teachings, but they unexpectedly started fighting.</p>
<p>The child shouted again: "Save some strength to fight the Japanese."</p>
<p>However, they still ignored it.</p>
<p>I thought it was funny that they didn't know shame after being ridiculed by a child in this way.</p>
<p>Later, it was probably resolved by several black-clothed policemen who ran over.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Spoiling the Scenery <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>This is indeed a great way to spoil the scenery, but the unconscionable Chinese people consider it insignificant, thus creating the same treatment as "Chinese and dogs" by foreigners!</p>
<p>In these few days, Suzhou's Tiger Hill seems like a young girl who has put on brilliant new clothes... The peach blossoms are as red as brocade, and the soft green willow branches are woven into lovely green oil curtains. The fragrant grass is also newly green like a lawn, filled with intoxicating allure everywhere. As a result, groups of spring excursion men and women are also flocking here to enjoy the spring. However, these elegant people, while leisurely touring the famous scenic spots, also want to carry out the elegant affair in the poem "when flowers bloom, pick them when you can," holding handfuls of mountain flowers as a special symbol of their spring outing. Those who come later can only look at the wooden sign that says "picking flowers and trees is prohibited," and sigh grandly!</p>
<p>Zhangjia Garden, along the Xiaohai River outside Changmen, is the private garden of the owner of Zhang Xiangfeng Confectionery, covering an area of about sixty acres. In addition to halls, pavilions, rockeries, ponds, etc., the garden is planted with various fruit trees, which has a unique poetic charm of boundless flat forests. In Suzhou's gardens, it occupies a unique charm. The Zhang family originally openly invites tourists to visit, which is originally the garden owner's unselfish intention. However, in recent days, a group of tourists has practiced the doctrine of plunder on the calligraphy and paintings of famous people and antique objects in the halls of the garden, completely stealing them. The Zhang family has suffered this loss and had to close the doors to those tourists who are not upper class.</p>
<p>Such a way to spoil the scenery may be regarded by a group of elegant people as a minor moral issue that is insignificant; however, the Chinese are equal to animals, but it is precisely on these minor moral issues that can be entered and exited!</p>
<h3 id="e226">As the saying goes: "One monk carries water to drink, two monks carry water to eat, three monks have no water to drink." People are generally lazy and want to be idle, but we should not shirk responsibility! Only by being hardworking, enduring hardship, and being diligent and responsible in handling affairs can we succeed in a great cause. <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>

<p>A tobacco shop worker said, "My monthly salary is seven yuan, and I have to spend five yuan on household expenses. Laundry, bathing, haircuts, buying shoes and socks, adding clothes, socializing, giving gifts, pocket money... Ah, how is it enough...?"</p>
<p>An old woman murmured to herself, "Two hundred cash of soy sauce is gone in just forty days. One hundred and fifty cash of cabbage can only stir-fry two small bowls. Alas, life is really difficult!"</p>
<p>A wealthy woman said, "I just went to XX Company to buy some supplies. Two hundred dollars wasn't enough. Haha, this week I only spent less than five hundred dollars, which is much more economical than last time."</p>

<p>Therefore, he couldn't help but pace back and forth on the road. Guizhi, seeing his appearance, figured that he must be very wronged in his heart. She originally wanted to say a few words to comfort him, but that would reveal that her feelings for him had not ended. Therefore, she smiled and said, "Second Master, see you tomorrow, I'll wish you a Happy New Year tomorrow." Saying that, she smiled slightly. Ji Zhi then woke up. He was about to reply to her, but it seemed that she was deliberately avoiding him. Only in the midst of his slightly squinting eyes and smiling did she walk away. When Ji Zhi looked towards the door, he saw that her figure, although very strong, still possessed a kind of graceful appearance. He thought that this kind of talent, although born in an old family, could endure hardship and work hard and cooperate with her husband. And if she led him onto a new path, he would understand the same way. If you want to talk about modern women, this is what counts as a modern woman. However, nowadays, people regard the word "modern" as flashy and alluring. Who can appreciate this kind of talent? Only I appreciate it, but I can't marry her. Ji Zhi stared blankly at the Zhao family's door for a while, sighed twice, and then went back. The reason why Ji Zhi left this family was because his elder brother and sister-in-law looked down on him and added a kind of pressure to him. In order to clear his own personality, he had no choice but to go out and work hard. As for the emotional aspect, he did not hate his elder brother. Fortunately, he already had a job. Even though he had been oppressed by his elder brother using his job in the past, that was a thing of the past, and there was no need to hate him. Moreover, when Hou Zhi was sick, Ji Zhi had returned to serve his elder brother's illness. Because of this, Hou Zhi was very moved, so before the Lunar New Year, he wrote several letters to Ji Zhi, wanting him to be sure to come back for the New Year. If Ji Zhi didn't come back, it would seem like there was a rift, so he returned to Haidian the day before New Year's Eve. When Guizhi saw him, he had already looked at the outside of his own gate several times.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Research on Inkstones (26) Other Famous Inkstones <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke</p>
<p>One person making two kinds of inkstones In the past, people imitated ancient inkstones, and they often made more than one kind. For example, the Song Dynasty's Liu Xisou, according to the Ou Spectrum, was good at making Chengni inkstones, but other books also say that Liu Xisou made excellent ancient tile inkstones, but they were not produced in large quantities, and scholars and officials' families could not have them readily available. Another example is the Ming Dynasty Jiangxi Prince, according to Tang's Inkstone Records, who was good at making Weiyang tile inkstones, but other books also say that the Prince made Bronze Sparrow inkstones, which had secret techniques, were rich and moist, and produced ink well. Those who obtained them regarded them as rare treasures. It can be seen that the Prince was actually imitating these two kinds of inkstones at the same time.</p>
<p>My late father, Lord Jinchuan, left behind a Bronze Sparrow tile inkstone, about seven inches long and slightly less than nine fen thick. The material is firm and fine, and it does not dry out the ink. The back has a coarse cloth pattern. There are six official script characters, "Made in the thirteenth year of Jian'an," in an ancient and vigorous style. On the upper right of the front, there are sixteen official script characters: "The essence of water and fire combines to form a shape." On the left, there are sixteen official script characters: "Heroes are gone, but tiles still remain." In the middle on both sides, there are twelve characters: "For the love of Tao Zhen's quality, it is appropriate to add the title of Jimo." Below, after checking previous people's notes, there are thirty-six official script characters: "I obtained it from the depths of the Zhang River, exchanging thirty-nine coins for it and adding it to my writing to be a plaything for erudition and love of art. Yuexian recognized it on the Double Ninth Festival of Hongwu Xinwei." These are horizontally arranged in eleven lines, with three or four characters per line. However, the lower end of my inkstone is already broken and cut off by four or five fen, so only one or two characters per line remain. For example, the characters "I, Zhang, Deep, Nine, And, Brush, For, Art, Xin, Wei, Yue" are still preserved, which is very regrettable. The Weiyang inkstone made by the Jiangxi Prince mentioned above has the three characters "Yuexian wrote," and this inkstone also has Yuexian's inscription. Therefore, it is suspected that this inkstone may also have been made by the Prince. However, I have never seen the real Weiyang inkstone made by the Prince, so it cannot be proven whether this inkstone was made by the Prince or was repeatedly imitated by someone else. It will be left to the appraisal of archaeologists.</p>

<p>Attached Ancient Brick In addition to ancient tile inkstones, there are also ancient brick inkstones, and there are many fake products. According to the Yipiao Collection, ancient bricks, especially Han bricks, are the firmest. For example, Jianping bricks are from the time of Emperor Ai, Yongjian bricks are from the time of Emperor Shun, and Zhongping bricks are from the time of Emperor Ling. They all have a warm and moist color. It is said that at that time, when making bricks, the clay must be mixed for dozens of days, mixed with pine resin. Although the manufacturing method is slightly different from Chengni inkstones, the actual substance is roughly the same. After more than two thousand years, they are still lovely. Therefore, ancient brick inkstones were highly valued by inkstone enthusiasts in the Kangxi and Qianlong periods. Ruan Yuan of Yangzhou's Eight Obstacles Inkstone is the most famous, among which is a Yellow Dragon first year brick inkstone, which was later obtained by a Qing Taoist, who named his studio the Yellow Dragon Inkstone Studio. The love for it can be imagined.</p>

<h3 id="e230">New York Correspondence, Letter No. 1: New York Has No Spring? <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ailan</p>
<p>Brother Liewen:</p>
<p>Your letter asked me to write something for your esteemed publication, suggesting I use the epistolary style to describe my observations and experiences in America to enlighten readers at home. In your esteemed opinion, perhaps you think that having me talk about things from across the ocean would avoid touching any sensitive "nets." But you don't know my difficulties. If I were to write down everything I've seen and heard, I would offend many people, smash many well-established clay idols back home, and puncture many beautifully pasted paper tigers. Someone as clever as you and I wouldn't do such a foolish thing. People back home are treating overseas students like kaleidoscopes, like peep shows, holding them up to look again and again, playing with them over and over. How could we do such a spoilsport thing as tearing down the peep show?</p>
<p>But I can't refuse your kind intentions. I've been away from home for five years. Due to my environment and personal temperament, I've rarely picked up a pen to prattle to my compatriots. Now, my retirement fund is running low, and I have to return home. Taking advantage of this spare time, I'm reviving my writing and returning to my life with pen and ink. It's almost spring now. Since we're not to "discuss state affairs," and we can't talk about the ungentlemanly words and deeds of the old overseas students, let's talk about "Spring in New York." This belongs to the "The weather is nice today, haha" category, so I don't think it will offend anyone.</p>
<p>I remember once in a "Writing Workshop" class at Columbia University, a professor gave us a topic: "Spring in New York." I don't remember what I wrote at the time, but I remember the opening line: "New York has no spring."</p>
<p>At that time, I had been in New York for less than a year. Besides attending classes and the library, I sometimes took the subway to Times Square to see a show. I rarely went anywhere else. What I saw were tall buildings, and people and cars hurrying back and forth on the streets. I rarely had the opportunity to see the sun directly during the day, and I never dreamed of seeing the moonlight at night. When the streets were covered in snow and people were busy buying Christmas presents, I knew it was winter; when the sun during the day made me sweat and people were wearing straw hats, I knew it was summer. As for spring, I really didn't know that New York had such a thing as "spring." The same was true for autumn. So I started by writing, "New York has no spring."</p>
<p>That was three years ago. When you live in a place for a long time, you discover many things that you could never discover in a short period of time. You realize that you know far too little about the local customs and conditions. I remember a certain gentleman nicknamed "Terrible" passed through New York. Before his seat was even warm, he returned home and wrote a travelogue of New York, translating Fifth Avenue, a street wider and busier than Nanjing Road in Shanghai, as "Fifth Alley." I don't know how wide the alleys are in his esteemed hometown, but they can't be wider than Fifth Avenue, which divides the east and west sides of New York. As for these kinds of people, I can only admire their boldness. It is said that there are quite a few such people back home. Who says we are a cowardly nation?</p>
<p>If I had left New York at that time, I might have always said that New York has no spring. But I lived there for three years, and in my spare time, I explored New York in every direction. Only then did I gradually realize that New York is not without spring.</p>
<p>In New York, what makes you feel the arrival of spring first is the various colorful billboards. These advertisers are truly the so-called first to feel the changing trends. From the elevated trains in the sky to the subway cars underground, from the rooftops to the delivery trucks, when you no longer see the advertisements selling cold remedies, or the advertisements depicting girls who get dates with men because they use Lifebuoy soap to get rid of BO (body odor), and they shed their fur coats and change into spring clothes, you know that spring is coming to the world.

<p>— Man</p>
<p>In the coastal villages of our country, a certain custom is often maintained—armed brawls. This is true not only in coastal areas but also in the interior.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, this is a remnant of barbarism. People from Village A and Village B often argue over a small road during the lantern festivals or competitions, refusing to give way. During the dispute, there is bound to be a fierce fight, often resulting in bloodshed, with several deaths and injuries. This is immediately followed by years of endless lawsuits, causing many people to be impoverished. And even if wise local officials are willing to help the people overcome difficulties and resolve disputes, they are often at a loss.</p>
<p>Why are they unwilling to give way a little? Their traditional notion is that giving way is a very unlucky thing. Of course, there may be a lot of resentment brewing between the farmers of Village A and Village B due to disputes over fields, water, and various other minor matters. When they encounter a situation with many people, they feel that the opportunity has arrived, and they must take a major revenge, so they fight. But even farmers who are at peace with each other can easily fight in such situations because giving way is "inauspicious" to them.</p>
<p>Scholars say: This is mob spirit! It's due to the lack of widespread education and the failure to civilize customs!…</p>
<p>"However, that's not the case." The burning of black slaves in America and the beating of Jews in Western Europe are not necessarily due to low levels of education. There is a fighting spirit in human nature. Even daily entertainment, gambling, and games are still interesting because they involve competition and winning or losing. "He loves bravery more than I do, but he doesn't know where to take it!" Confucius criticized Zilu in this way, but it has already been proven that Confucius himself loved bravery to an extreme. "Beyond" this extreme is of course not acceptable, so it is not worth taking.</p>
<p>Inauspiciousness is certainly a superstition, but there is a great deal of truth in it—it embodies the nation's vitality! Imagine if everyone in this nation said "Amitabha" and yielded in everything, becoming as soft and weak as a lump of mud. Wouldn't that be terrible? Whether it's the "people of the Land of Innocence" or the "people of the Land of Perfect Bliss," the spirit of the people will weaken, degenerate, and regress in a peaceful environment. Allowing student groups in American universities to fight, even to the point of bloodshed, without recording demerits or expelling them, is not without profound reasoning.</p>
<p>Moreover, brave and martial people are commendable. Only with bravery and martial spirit can one have compassion. Confucius liked those who were "zealous" because they could easily enter the "Way." Weak, effeminate, speaking of compassion but harboring resentment, is what is truly hopeless.</p>

<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>I secretly thanked her in my heart. At the same time, a trace of weariness invaded my body, and I couldn't help but yawn. I was indeed a bit exhausted. I had been in this hospital for three days, and I had hardly closed my eyes during those three days. As soon as I heard my wife's voice, my heart would jump anxiously, fearing that she was about to give birth. Now that she had given birth, my heart was relieved, and fatigue quickly took over my spirit. But I didn't want to rest or sleep. I was just worried about home. It had been three days since I had returned home. I wondered what a mess it must be in? The dust had probably filled the entire house, and the letters and publications on the table had probably piled up into a small hill. These all needed me to go back and sort them out. So, I told my wife this.</p>
<p>My wife didn't object. She just said, "You must come back here tonight."</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked her blankly.</p>
<p>My wife didn't speak. Her face suddenly turned red. I suddenly understood that she was just timid and didn't dare to sleep alone in the hospital. So, I comforted her with a few words and promised to come back before dark, and then I left her and took the bus home.</p>
<p>The situation at home was not as bad as I had imagined. The air was just a bit colder, but otherwise nothing had changed. The dust was only a thin layer on the furniture, and there were only four or five letters and publications on the table. I casually opened a letter and took a look, and couldn't help but be shocked. The letter was from my aunt's house, reporting that my cousin had passed away from illness. This news really gave me a big shock, because just four or five days ago, this cousin was still drifting around Shanghai, staying at our place. He had come to Shanghai to find a way out because he couldn't make a living in his hometown, but he didn't have any talent. In the end, he didn't find a way out and instead returned home with an illness. I deeply sympathized with his misfortune, although I was ashamed that I didn't have the power to help him. But I didn't expect him to die so quickly. How quickly people come together and separate in life! I held the letter, stood in the house, looked at the sunlight outside the window, and couldn't help but feel a little melancholy.</p>
<p>The world was still the same world, life was still the same life, and I was still living in this world and this life. The only difference was that I had added a child, while my cousin, whom I had seen often from childhood to the present, had turned into a foreign object.</p>
<p>"One soul has just been born into the world, while another soul has been forced to death by society. What kind of life is this?" I thought painfully, and a shiver ran through my entire body. A big question welled up in my mind: How can I ensure that my child will not follow in the footsteps of my cousin in the future and be reduced to a life of decline and early death?</p>
<p>I thought silently, but my heart felt a faint pain. I no longer regarded the birth of my child as a happy event.</p>
<p>In the evening, when I returned to the hospital, my wife greeted me with a smile, took the child out of the blanket for me to see, and said to me,</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask you, what should we name him?"</p>
<p>I looked at the child's little face, but I vaguely saw the shadow of my newly deceased cousin flickering before my eyes. I couldn't bless this child anymore. I forced a bitter smile and said,</p>
<p>"Just call him Ming'er (Tomorrow). Although he was born at dawn, it is still uncertain whether he will bring some light to this world."</p>

<p>— Wu He</p>
<p>Is it longing for the homeland beneath the white clouds? Why stand silently before the monument</p>
<p>all day long?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Tell me about the homeland, exile! Look,</p>
<p>the geese cross the sky.</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>Doesn't the light cold intrude?</p>
<p>(The air is also biting!)</p>
<p>In the southern land you consider paradise?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Is that green, bean-like lamp warm, in the lodging-house where you stay?</p>
<p>I fear it will only make your tears flow even more!</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Return, then, and struggle with your suffering brothers!</p>
<p>The people of the south can only offer you mockery!</p>

<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>This segment of the legend is truly a palace-style short story with a great deal of poetic flavor; perhaps because it is too poetic, both the Lin'an Annals and the Yuqian Annals record this event in detail, using it for embellishment. As a result, both East Tianmu and West Tianmu have Eye-Washing Ponds, Zhaoming Temples, Prince's Palaces, and Scripture-Dividing Platforms. When writers are alive, their articles are often not worth half a penny, and they mostly starve to death. But when their flesh turns to ashes and their bones turn to charcoal, everyone wants to attach themselves to them, climbing the dragon and clinging to the phoenix, scrambling to claim association. Is this truly the permanent effect of literature? Analyzing it, I think there are still many material causes. Because when writers are alive, they still need to eat, wear clothes, and have children. But after they have died for hundreds of years, there is naturally no need for material provision. Mentioning that someone once lived here, someone once came here, can attract tourists and earn a few pennies; and monks and Taoists can use this to raise money by begging and deception, building magnificent and splendid temples and pagodas. If this is not a material cause, then what is it?</p>
<p>Coming out of the Lion's Mouth, after seeing the Thousand Character Rock and the Lion Rock, follow the mountain path eastward. Pass the Eye-Washing Pond, where there is a pool of water under a tree, and then go around the so-called Tree King, a giant cedar tree that takes fifteen or sixteen arm spans to encircle. After walking one or two li, you will arrive at the Upper Old Founding Hall. This stretch of road from the Lion's Mouth to the Founding Hall, which is along the mountainside, is all flat, with very many old trees and strange rocks. There are also many wide and open foundations, of which one does not know the number. The ancient temples of West Tianmu that I mentioned earlier must have been in this area. It is also possible that the Founding Hall is the Lion Progenitor Zen Temple. The plaque with the large characters "Great Tree Hall" written by Xu Shichang, hanging in the back room of the Founding Hall, presumably refers to the Tree King. In reality, there are many large trees here, and it cannot be considered a unique and rare sight. The ultimate scenery of West Tianmu, however, lies in the so-called Hanging Lotus Flower Cliff, a cliff over a hundred zhang high, standing upright like a lotus flower. Behind this lotus flower is an even more precipitous cliff, about two hundred zhang high, facing one petal of the lotus flower. Standing at the foot of the cliff and looking up, there is only a line of sky two or three chi wide, shining whitely above. Next to the Lotus Flower Rock, a few chi away, there is also a stone platform, which is flat on top and has an octagonal pavilion built on it. On the east side of the road leading to this pavilion, a cluster of strange rocks looks like the hand of a Buddha reaching towards the sky, towering at the top of a deep valley. Above this Buddha's Finger is not far from the Mountain Hall. At the top of the two rocky noses protruding south... the panoramic view of the valley seen from these two rocky noses is the only great view of West Tianmu. For the master Yutang to have arrived at West Tianmu, but not to come to this place to appreciate the panoramic view of the nearby valley, and the steep, upright cliffs and strange rocks, would be the greatest mistake in the world, the Dichung suppressing the Wahaheit!</p>
<p>One of the rocky noses is a unique peak that extends southward from the front of the Founding Hall for about one li, which is the place the monks call the Upside-Down Lotus Flower. Looking south from the tip of the peak, one can see the streams, villages, small mountains, and fields within several hundred li clearly. The valleys, the streams, the fields, can be likened to an upside-down fan. The fan ribs are the remaining veins branching off from West Tianmu, the white paper in between the fan ribs are the streams and villages between the veins, and the famous painting painted on this fan is an extremely delicate and meticulous brush painting with rapeseed yellow, peach blossom red, plum blossom white, mountain colors, and trees in a touch of green!</p>

<p>— Lü Shaoguang</p>
<p>In the vast twilight,</p>
<p>the farmer's wife's</p>
<p>constant calls to the pigs rise up.</p>
<p>The haggard farmer,</p>
<p>leading a yellow ox on his back,</p>
<p>carrying a heavy rake,</p>
<p>walks wearily, like a ghost,</p>
<p>across the desolate field ridges.</p>
<p>A crescent moon, faintly</p>
<p>outlines the desolate thatched hut.</p>
<p>The yellow ox in the pen,</p>
<p>mourns plaintively,</p>
<p>awakening the farmer's illusions…</p>
<p>Little Mao's mother,</p>
<p>go quickly and see what's wrong with the ox,</p>
<p>I'm shivering all over again…</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Before long, the doorbell rang, and then two children rushed in, shouting,</p>
<p>"A guest has come!" After the older child said this, he turned around and looked at the visitor very shyly.</p>
<p>The father responded to the child's words and went out to greet the guest he had told the children about. After greeting the guest himself, he affectionately bent down and patted the child on the shoulder, saying,</p>
<p>"This is the guest I just told you about. You should all call her Auntie Li!"</p>
<p>The children called out shyly. The guest was a young woman, wearing a deep red cheongsam, with slightly curled hair and a long, round face with a smile, looking very gentle. She walked up to the children and gave them each a delicate and beautiful box. The younger child looked at the box for a while and said with a smile, "Daddy, it's chocolate!"</p>
<p>"That's right. Are you happy?"</p>
<p>The child looked at the smiling father and then at the smiling guest, as if thanking the guest for this satisfying gift. Afterwards, they saw their father sitting with the guest in the living room and Auntie Lu serving flowers, so the two of them retreated to the study. They were exceptionally excited to have a female guest in their home, and each of them had received a box of things they loved to eat.</p>
<p>"Brother, I like your box. Look, your box has red flowers, mine isn't red," the girl said, grabbing her brother's hand.</p>
<p>When her brother heard her say this, he seemed to think that his box was really better than hers, and he shook his head, refusing to give it up. But she kept asking, so he said,</p>
<p>"Then let's open them both and see if they're all chocolate!"</p>
<p>The candies were the same, so the younger sister stopped talking. They each ate a piece and ran to the living room. The father was talking intimately with the guest. It was rare to see the father looking so happy. Seeing them coming, the father smiled at them and said to the guest, "Let's take a look at our study!" The guest stood up, took the girl's hand, and the father walked in front, pointing out each item to the guest.</p>
<p>"Whenever I come home, I always work here. Look, things are so messy here, it's terrible."</p>
<p>The guest smiled happily and nodded. The girl always looked up at them talking and laughing. Suddenly, she remembered the mother's photo near the clothes rack, so she said to the guest coquettishly,</p>
<p>"There's also a photo of Mommy over there, look!"</p>
<p>The guest followed the direction indicated by the little hand. It was a photo of a young woman. The forceful gaze, the short hair, and the smile on the corners of her mouth showed that she had a very decisive expression. The girl continued to look at the guest, and the older brother looked at the mother's photo for a while and then looked at the guest as well. They thought that the guest would definitely praise their mother happily. But they saw the smile on the guest's face fade away. She looked at the father, patted the girl's shoulder, and said,</p>

<h3 id="e237">Financial and Gold Market Initially Strong, Then Weak: Guangdong Merchants Force Sales, Once Breaking 70 Yuan Level, Poor Telecommunications Result in 8 Cents Drop <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday was initially strong but then weakened due to slightly poor telecommunications and general opportunistic sales. Although foreign exchange markets in England and America rose in the morning, the closing price of forward silver on the Five Metals Exchange suddenly showed a slight contraction, and exchange rates also fell, dampening sentiment. Although London spot gold rose by 7.5 pence, American cotton rose by 3 points, and American wheat fell by 75, stock prices rose by 9.9 cents. The wool market opened higher, then retreated from 70 yuan to 68 yuan, as Fuxing, Yongyi, Dayong, and others bought in, while Huixiang, Qianchang, Xiangzhi, Fengyongfu, Yuheng, Yu, and others opportunistically sold high. After the opening, the market was flat. The HSBC listing was announced, with the British rate flat and the American rate down 1.25, showing a more stable trend. Guangdong merchants worked hard to buy in, pushing the price through the 70 yuan mark. However, according to an Associated Press report, U.S. President Roosevelt requested Congress to grant him special powers to handle all silver matters, implicitly denying all silver proposals in Congress. However, because retail investors were generally short, major players sold, taking advantage of the opportunity to suppress prices, and the gold market immediately fell. Furthermore, speculators such as Mr. Wu also sold, hardening the exchange market and causing further declines. However, banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, covering short positions, and the market recovered slightly at noon. In the afternoon, although Guangdong merchants continued to cut long positions and Yuan Yi also sold, the exchange market was quite good, and there were many buyers, making the situation quite stable, hovering around 50 yuan. The price of pure gold was calculated at 984 yuan, and the swap rate continued to decline to 5 yuan. Below is a record of the day's market conditions.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 968.2 yuan, an increase of 2.1 yuan compared to the previous close. Physical goods opened at the same price. The opening price for British exchange was a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 0.0625. The U.S. exchange rate was 34.4375 yuan. Mitsui and Wah Bi bid 625 for U.S. dollars for June. Yuanchang and Yongbao reached 7.5 yuan. Hengtai, Fuxing, and Yong then bought in, rising to 8.5 yuan, as it was rumored that the HSBC listing would show the British rate flat and the U.S. rate down 1.25. Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yongda, and the Dalian gang also bought in. Mai Jia Li bid 35 yuan for U.S. dollars for September. Yuankang, Xiangda, the Dalian gang, Yuanmao, Yong, physical goods, and others sold to 7.4 yuan. Shengda, Fuchang, Yida, Yongding, Kangyongde, Yicheng, Qianchang, and Xiang all bought in. Mitsui bought 875 for U.S. dollars for August and 35 yuan for September, rising to 70 yuan and 8 cents. Although Yida Yong sold, Shengda and Hengxing strongly bought in, further rising to 9 cents. However, foreign telecommunications suddenly favored silver, and Shunli, Yida, Yongda, Decheng, Hengyu, Huixiang, Fuxing, Yongyongde, Yuansheng, Yongfu, Chang, and others competed to sell. Retail investors strongly suppressed the price, and in an instant, it fell to 55.3 yuan. Anda and others bought slightly, and Yida, Yongfuchang, Hengxing, Yuqingyong took advantage of the situation to all buy in, recovering to 6.7 yuan. Sentiment remained timid. Wah Bi and Hua Yi Mai Jia Li all sold U.S. dollars for May at half a yuan, and U.S. dollars for September at 35.125 yuan were difficult to sell. Zhaofeng Chang, Yuqingyong, Yuankang, Xianghui, and others fiercely sold again, falling to 3 yuan. Mai Jia Li bought 1875 for U.S. dollars for September. Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yongyuanchun, Shunli, and others bought to 5 yuan. Qianchangxiang bought in and then sold out again, falling to 4.2 yuan. Hengxing still accepted the price.

Mitsui bought 35.225 for U.S. dollars for September and 35 yuan for August. Hengyu Yuanmao Yong bought in again to 5.9 yuan, while Yuankang Xiang Yuan Yi Yuqingyong sold again and fell, but Yuankang Xiang Hengyu Wanxing strongly bought in and were quite stable. Hengxing relentlessly sold, and the market could not sustain, and Qianchangxiang sold off, falling to 4.3 yuan. However, because Wah Bi bought 875 for U.S. dollars for July, Hengyu Fuyu Chunyuanyong and others all bought in. Shanghai bought 0.0625 for U.S. dollars for September, gradually rising to 5.6 yuan. Fuchang Hengyu sold off, and the market fluctuated, hovering around, and the closing price was 965.3 yuan, with physical goods traded at the same price. The highest price during the day was 970.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 963 yuan, a difference of 7.9 yuan. As a result, the closing price was slightly lower than the previous close by 8 cents.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the HSBC U.S. exchange listing, down 1.25, at 34 yuan, and the standard gold price was 1,017.65 yuan.</p>

The registered price for May was 973 yuan, and for June, it was 965 yuan. The morning margin call was 973 yuan, and the afternoon margin call was the same price. The price of pure gold was calculated at 984 yuan, and the spot market for pure gold was flat. In the market, the Tianjin gang sold to Yinfeng Heng, mostly to Dadecheng, and a small amount to others, adding 16.5 yuan, for a total of more than 2,000 taels, and the trend remained active. The Tianjin gang was hedging swaps, and it was expected that Tianjin goods would flood in after the 25th. Eastern goods were priced with an addition of 15.5 yuan, which was accepted by Taikangrun and Dadecheng, among others. On the swap market, Tianfeng paid Yinfeng Heng 70 swaps at 5.5 yuan. After entering the market, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Tongfeng, Yinfeng, Heng, and others continued to swap out, causing further declines, with Hengxing paying Tongfeng Heng 280 swaps, Yinfeng Heng 70 swaps, and Dadecheng 35 swaps at 5 yuan. However, Hengxing was still willing to buy in swaps and settle. At noon, Huiyuan posted, rising to 5.3 yuan. In the afternoon market, Hengxing initially paid Hengyu 63 swaps at 5 yuan. After entering the market, Hengyu suddenly was willing to pay out, but there were few long positions, so the price recovered higher. In the end, trading was quiet. Today, there were still 9,009 swaps for May remaining, with a total of 7 long positions and 29 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was active. In summary, Shunli, Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongheng, Yuyuanchun, Hengxing, Yuanyuanmao Yongding, Kangcui, Taiyicheng, Fuchang, Daxingyong Qianchangxiang, Tongfengheng, and others were on the buying side.

<h3 id="e239">Silver and Money Industries Still Lack Development Potential Amidst the Tea and Silk Seasons <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, due to various reasons, various commercial sectors have been unable to develop, and goods have been stagnant and unsalable, causing the silver and money industries to dare not extend loans. Even if some ventured to make loans, most were fearful and hesitant, ultimately leading to a concentration of cash that could not flow out. As a result, it was difficult for various industries seeking turnover to receive even a drop of assistance. Currently, with the tea and silk seasons gradually entering the market, there is still not much demand. Yesterday, the import and export of foreign goods and domestic goods were crowded, and there were many collections of payments, so the situation was slightly better than before. The foreign interbank rate was also good by one point, calculated at five points.

<h3 id="e241">Securities and Bond Market May Lead to a Short Squeeze - Yesterday's Market Showed Signs of Imminent Collapse <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchantile Stock Exchange experienced a shaky market sentiment due to the increasingly strong stance of the Southwest, which seemed dissatisfied with foreign powers. The trend of government bonds showed signs of imminent collapse. With the delivery date approaching, the total amount of accounts exceeded 80 million. Numbers 11, 16, and 38, the three largest short positions, held 15-16 million, most of which had goods to deliver. Number 46 was long 22 customs bonds, exceeding 1 million, and Number 53 was long disbandment bonds, exceeding 1 million, both possessing the financial strength to take delivery. The remaining long and short positions were substantial, but scattered among various groups. Due to the environment, a short squeeze might develop. In any case, without active arbitrage trading, price increases would be difficult. Yesterday, the market opened with a uniform decline, and various groups aggressively sold in small amounts. However, Number 53 still had a strong appetite for disbandment bonds, buying heavily in both morning sessions, which helped to maintain the market price. Various bonds slightly decreased by 3-4 cents, while only disbandment bonds remained slightly positive by 1 cent. In the second session, selling pressure remained strong, and the market price continued to drop slightly by 3-4 cents, while disbandment bonds remained firm. In the afternoon, Number 53 stopped buying disbandment bonds, and Number 38 began selling heavily, causing a decline of half a yuan, while other bonds continued to weaken. Only the June and September bonds remained relatively firm. At the close, scattered groups slightly covered their short positions, causing a slight recovery of 2-3 cents. The market showed an inability to rise and remained sluggish. As a result, prices uniformly fell by 2-5 cents. Because the close for the 20 customs bonds could not be determined, they experienced a larger drop compared to others. The total turnover was 19,417,000 yuan, including 7,000 yuan in spot trading and 19,410,000 yuan in futures trading. The high, low, and change in prices are listed below (unit: yuan or single delivery value of 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e242">New York Low-Priced Stocks Most Active <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal market report from the Sun Fung Foreign Firm report, the stock market continued to rise yesterday, due to favorable business reports and improved sentiment on Wall Street. Low-priced stocks were the most active, and preferred stocks gradually advanced, with demand remaining strong, but the market lacked supply. The small exchange and bonds rose along with the stock market. Wheat was initially strong, but retreated due to profit-taking by long positions. Traders were mostly watching and waiting for the results of Roosevelt's discussion with Congress on the silver issue tomorrow. Furthermore, according to the New York agent of this firm, (securities) sentiment was good, and the advance was quite strong. Tobacco, rubber, and specialty stocks were particularly firm. (Wheat) Long positions have stopped profit-taking. Rain is expected in the Northwest, and in terms of the situation, declines favor buying. (Cotton) A large number of May contracts were gradually settled, but there was no significant reason to encourage eager buying. Washington opposes further experimental legislation and wants Congress to adjourn in mid-May. The above situation should stabilize the market. The彭克海 proposal has also been passed. Spot goods are quiet, and the footing is slightly loose. (Silver) After the price limit, London only bought at extremely low prices, and generally felt disappointed. Although the opening was high, it eventually retreated slightly. According to rumors, most of the sellers were Chinese. The total daily turnover was 1.54 million shares. Below are the Dow Jones New York indices:</p>

<p>The yarn market showed a slight peace, because the continuous decline for many days caused a partial profit-taking, and after the increase in special margin for new sellers, the general retail short positions decreased, and the market can be established. Although no large-scale sales of spot yarns have been seen recently, scattered transactions are more active, but sellers still hold to the principle of selling on rallies, but the bottom has dried up and the prices are now equal to those of Japanese yarns.</p>
<p>(Marked yarn has short covering) The marked yarn market opened higher in the morning due to the increase in special margin, but then fell back due to the selling by powerful large traders. Each month rose slightly by 2-3 cents. In the afternoon, short covering caused the April contract to rise by 1.4 yuan, and the long-term contracts rose by 0.12-0.13 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 34,600 bales. It was found that Sui Long sold 700 bales, Da Fu 800 bales, Tong Fu 850 bales, Yuan Da 1,000 bales, Geng Feng 1,750 bales, Xin Cheng 750 bales, Hui Kang 1,700 bales, and Chang Feng 1,450 bales. Ming De bought 600 bales, Jin Chang 700 bales, Geng Feng 600 bales, Yu Da 700 bales, Shen Ji 500 bales, and Chang Feng 1,450 bales.

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation still does not escape the fluctuating situation. However, the general sellers believe that the price of cotton is too high compared with the price of yarn, and the idea of shorting is very strong. As for the buyers, according to the weak inventory in Shanghai, they keep tight and do not let go, so it suddenly rises and falls between five and six corners. General retail investors suffered a great blow.</p>
<p>(There is no major difference in Zheng Biao) The Biao Song market opened higher in the morning, then fell back by 5 cents to 2.5 cents due to the crazy fall in the yarn market. In the afternoon, the market suddenly tightened, with each month rising by 1.5 to 2 cents. The total turnover for the day was 64,100 loads. It was found that Tong Fu sold 2,200 loads, Heng Yi 1,000 loads, Chun Ji 4,000 loads, Da Chang 2,200 loads, Yong Da 1,000 loads, Ren Feng 1,000 loads, Yuan Xing Chang 1,200 loads, and He 1,800 loads.

<h3 id="e245">Yarn Exchange Announces Increased Special Margin for New Marked Yarn Sellers <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The price drop in cotton yarn recently has become increasingly intense, with a sense of irreversible decline. The price drop in the April marked yarn is the most tragic. It was found that the price on March 15 was 185 yuan, the price of the April marked cotton was 42.3 yuan, and yesterday's closing price of marked yarn was 160.03 yuan, a drop of 24.7 yuan, and the marked cotton was 41.4 yuan, a drop of only 0.9 yuan. The price difference between yarn and cotton is getting farther and farther apart, which shows the difficulties of the factory. It was found that the reasons for the decline in cotton yarn are: 1. The decline in rural areas and the depression of sales, resulting in an increase in inventory; 2. Although the factories have repeatedly convened meetings, ostensibly sympathizing with the proposal that each yarn should not be sent to the exchange, it is contrary to the facts. The amount of each yarn in the warehouse is increasing day by day, and opinions are still difficult to unify. Therefore, speculators regard the abundant chips in the exchange, and the Bao Feng suddenly rises, and the Japanese merchants sell even more enthusiastically. As a result, the entire yarn market has been broken, resulting in a sharp decline. The current market situation is estimated to be difficult to maintain at the 60 yuan level. Therefore, yesterday, the factory party requested that the exchange increase the special margin of 8 yuan in cash for each bale of new sales for each month's term of marked yarn in the current week, and temporarily suppress the selling and save the yarn market. The market announcement is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange, starting from April 19, will increase the special margin for new sales of cotton yarn in each month's term, 8 yuan in cash per bale, and the seller of each new two-stock account will also increase the special margin of 8 yuan in cash per bale. Unveiling the announcement.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was firm and lively. It initially rose due to good news from Liverpool but then declined as long positions were closed. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose by two to three points. Liverpool spot cotton rose by 15 points, and futures by eight to nine points. Egyptian spot cotton rose by 19 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to sales by European exporters and Japanese traders but later recovered as short positions were covered and the value of gold bullion rose. As a result, Pingal, Barosi, and Creek each rose by three rupees and seven and a half annas, and Omra rose by three rupees. (Originally from a telegram dated the 18th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for all months generally showed a flat and weak trend. The quoted prices for foreign wheat from Chicago were down by 2.5 cents, and those from Canada were down by about 0.25 cents. At the opening, both buyers and sellers in the market were mostly in a wait-and-see attitude, and actual sales were also mostly stagnant. Some factories were engaging in near-end buying and far-end selling, while others were secretly making slight sales. Therefore, the market sentiment was already weakening amidst the fluctuations. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, rumors circulated that foreign flour and wheat would flood the market during the new wheat season, coupled with the low prices of various coarse grains, which were rare in the past decade or so. As a result, people's minds were unsettled, and prices gradually fell. Purchases from various regions had completely disappeared, which was the reason for this. This situation was already widespread, so there was probably no good prospect in the near term. Although the daily decline seemed insignificant, the prices for June and July were already on the verge of breaking through the two-dollar mark, and the unfavorable situation could be imagined. As a result, the current month was down by 0.75 cents, May was down by 0.5 cents, June was down by 1 cent, July was down by 1.125 cents, August was down by 0.5 cents, and September was down by 1 cent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market showed a weak trend in all months after the opening in the morning and afternoon. The quoted prices for foreign wheat from Chicago were down by 2.5 cents, and those from Canada were down by about 0.25 cents. After the opening in the morning, the price for the current month was down sharply by 0.7 cents compared to the opening price earlier in the week because it had not opened for several days and there was a surge of arrivals. Later, it did not open. The prices for distant months were relatively stable because of the slight rain in the morning. By the afternoon, the weather had cleared up, and the sales sentiment for June, July, and August became strong, and people's minds became even more unsettled. The opening prices gradually loosened. According to the industry insiders' prediction, the old standard would have to reach 0.3 dollars, and the new standard would have to reach between 0.4 and 0.5 dollars, because the goods from the countryside would inevitably flood the market during the new crop season. As a result, June was down by 0.3 cents, July remained unchanged, and August was down by 0.2 cents. There was no delivery of spot wheat because factory stomachs were temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources from various gangs (totaling more than 5,000 shih). The initial market for both local and out-of-town buyers was still ordinary, and the situation was just as it was. Later, the weather became cloudy and there were few new arrivals, so people's minds began to turn upward. Although there were many new customers from other places visiting the market for the first time, they were all making social transactions. Later, they began to compete for purchases, and the market suddenly became lively. At that time, sellers followed suit and raised their bids, so the market showed a rising trend. As a result, while Chang-bang remained settled, other types of non-glutinous rice such as Soochow Tong and South Port saw price increases of several cents to one dime. As for out-of-town buyers' wholesale purchases, both the northern and southern gangs were active, but the eating plate problem suddenly changed. Although the buying side made a move after making, but the unsold quantity was not effective, only forming a stable situation, so more than 2,000 bags of various goods such as Jiao-song, Si-xi were commonly sold, but the market conditions were not good or bad. Du-yang sharp-end shop stomach slightly wide, following the non-glutinous rice to bring up a few cents, yin-bian-yuan also has a beautiful color.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty-four or five sources from various roads along the river. The best-selling goods in the market were Bai-geng, Bai-yuan, and Yang-jian Bo-dao, while other goods were mediocre. The market price for Bai-geng, Bian-yuan, and Yang-jian increased once, with the price of high-quality materials increasing by nearly one dime, and the price of medium-quality materials also increasing by several cents. The price of Du-jian, Bu-jian, Ke-jian, early rice, Bo-dao, and Yin-yuan remained firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the out-of-town Xian market and the Fujian Hua market were even more lively. The local market appetite was also stronger than in the past, and other gangs were also inquiring. The market seemed to have a trend of gradually rising. However, new arrivals had become more active in recent days. Goods from Hunan had been arriving sporadically, and goods from Shashi, Zhaoshi, as well as Wuxi, Jiangbei, Nanjing, and Northern Anhui had also been continuously arriving. Therefore, although Kehua was lively, the market price was unable to rise step by step. Yesterday, the Fuzhou gang was the most interested, selling a total of more than 4,000 bags. The local gang sold more than 1,700 bags, Wenzhou sold 305 bags, and Shantou sold 103 bags, totaling 6,218 bags. The Fujian gang still had a lively atmosphere in the later market, so people in the market were still optimistic. However, they were observing that the subsequent arrivals would not be interrupted, so the market would still have a period of fluctuation. Even in the period when the old crop was running out and the new crop was not yet available, there was probably no hope of a significant rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was unchanged. The price of medium-quality Huai goods was slightly firmer by one to two cents, because factory stomachs were in need of stock, and people's minds were established. Yesterday, it was estimated that 10 carts of Yingzhou beans were sold, with prices ranging from $2.57 to $2.54. The local market purchased one cart of Quanhe beans for $2.60, as well as more than 100 bags of Feihe beans for $2.62. Exports to Zhengyangguan totaled more than 300 bags, with prices ranging from $2.72 to $2.70. Dalian beans and Du beans, as well as yellow sand, were also stable in the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants Association determined that the price of 24 coarse sand should rise by 5 cents in Customs Gold, to $19.85, but importers did not bite, so no transaction was made. The price of Taikoo Sugar B mark remained at $20.01, and the price of Hechi No. 89 was the same as yesterday, and no transactions were made either. More than 200 bags of domestically produced Longjiang Qing continued to be opened, with prices remaining at $10.035 and $10.04. The Hao-pan had Jian-bang Da-laihua open more than 100 bags of Zhang-diao Qing, with the price at $10.06. Honey-colored Tribute Ice was in short supply and popular. Previously, a telegram had been sent to urge the producing area to ship continuously, but it had been delayed due to rain. Yesterday, it was heard that the Hao family had received a telegram from the owner of the goods, saying that they had already been distributed, and would probably arrive in Shanghai next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Northern Goods, Large Pearl Dates in Short Supply and Popular <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The inventory of large pearl dates has been exhausted for some time. Recently, both the Fujian and Guangdong gangs have been active, so sales are lively and the market is firm. More than 80 bags arrived a few days ago and were immediately sold, with the price at $7, several cents higher than before. According to a letter from the producing area (Zhongmu), there are still about two or three carts remaining at the source, which can be shipped to Shanghai soon, but the cost including Shanghai expenses must be at least $7.0, so consolidation is difficult to profit from.</p>

<p>(Uneven Hatching, Delayed Development) In "Huzhou," improved varieties are not hatching well, and silkworm rearing has been delayed due to cold weather. Young silkworms are shivering and afraid of the cold, so fire is used to warm them, which is not good for their development. Early batches have been feeding leaves for six or seven days since their first sleep, while late batches have just started feeding leaves. In "Yuhang," the early silkworm eggs hatched by farmers have all been delayed in hatching, and most have been used to raise late silkworms. The amount raised is only 50-60% of last year. The early batches will soon have completed their first sleep, but their development is not healthy. In "Xucun," silkworm farmers are all raising improved varieties this year. Although the hatching was earlier than last year, silkworm rearing was delayed. Mulberry buds are also developing slowly due to cold weather. Early silkworms are feeding leaves for two sleeps, while late silkworms have been feeding leaves for five or six days since their first sleep.</p>
<p>(New York Raw Silk Prices Continue to Fall) In the New York raw silk market, raw silk prices continue to fall. Silk weaving factories are focusing on rayon for summer silks, so the demand for raw silk is weak. Japanese silk is being dumped at low prices. The price of standard Japanese silk is only $1.245 per pound, which is equivalent to a drop of nearly $400 per bale in Chinese currency. Chinese silk in hand is also being sold at discounted prices. B-grade white filature silk with a uniformity of 78-80% is only being offered at $500, but there are few buyers.</p>
<p>(Sichuan Yellow Native Silk Continues to Be Shipped to Shanghai) Yesterday, the Minsheng steamer arrived in Shanghai from Hankou and loaded 25 pieces of Sichuan yellow native silk, which were taken back by the Sichuan silk stores to be sold.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Silk Sales Quiet and Dull) Overseas silk weaving factories have weak demand for raw silk, and raw silk prices continue to decline. Japanese silk dumping is still strong, and no one is inquiring about Chinese silk. Shanghai manufacturers are pledging their silk stocks and preparing to close down. Silk sales are quiet. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 10 bales of gray filature silk, and Chouqi imported 5 bales of yellow filature silk, both at weakening prices.</p>

<p>Hangzhou green tea has always been the earliest to come out each year, but this year, due to the cold weather, tea buds have not been easy to develop. Therefore, since Qingming, most mountains have not yet started picking. According to a letter from Hangzhou, new Longjing tea from West Lake has already been launched on the market. However, due to the small amount of production and the high demand from Shanghai and Hangzhou buyers, the opening price for the first lot is 665 yuan per dan. In addition, tea farmers on Lion Peak have also begun picking tea, and a large number of new goods should be launched on the market within days.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Wuyuan Tea Industry Declining <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan is an important tea-producing area. Every year, it produces and sells no less than 70,000 boxes of foreign-style green tea. Since Tunxi and Shexian began to compete in the production of needle-shaped Zhenmei, the tea industry in this area has been greatly affected. Although the accounts were settled last year with varying degrees of profit and loss, the local vitality has weakened to the extreme. In addition, tea loans are still tight, so most tea houses are hesitant to act. As the new tea is about to arrive on the market, more than 20 tea houses have announced their closure, and others are also reducing their scale. The tea industry in this area is gradually showing a declining trend.</p>

<p>Valeting is even more popular this year, and sales of Western-style clothing are particularly strong. Although the peak sales season has not yet arrived, the industry has already begun to search for supplies. It is heard that three boxes arrived yesterday from Shanghai No. 2 and were immediately sold out, with prices ranging from $5.25 to $5.50 per yard. Those who did not obtain any are sighing with regret. It is estimated that the cost per yard is about $3.90.</p>

<h3 id="e259">The North China Crisis <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, North China has been in a very serious crisis. This crisis reached an unprecedented level of tension in the months before the signing of the Tanggu Truce last year. After the signing of the Tanggu Truce, the North China crisis, although temporarily eased slightly, continued to develop in secret. The delay in returning the war zone, the difficulty of bandit suppression, the continuous appearance of puppet troops, the occupation of Dolon, the emergency in Chahar and Suiyuan, and the occasional reconnaissance flights of Japanese aircraft over the outskirts of Peiping have all kept the entire North China in a state of anxiety and shock. North of the Yellow River, there has hardly been a moment of peace and stability since the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of China is very methodical. Before the September 18th Incident, when the world economic panic was developing to its deepest level, the economies and politics of various countries were very turbulent and uneasy. It anticipated that when this bomb exploded, the countries would be too busy to take care of themselves, and there would be no way to intervene. Sure enough, when the September 18th Incident broke out, it only added some turmoil to world politics, but no one dared to say that Japan was wrong in its actions, and some even secretly helped. Japan had anticipated this move.</p>
<p>After Japan occupied Northeast China, on the one hand, it dealt with the world, and most importantly, on the other hand, it also had to deal with the Chinese people, because the Chinese people are anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese. At this time, all his energy was focused on dealing with China. If China dared not move or make a sound again, then it would be easy for him to talk to the world. After considerable effort, China did not dare to move or make a sound again. Japan's goal was achieved as desired.</p>
<p>After China's submission, Japan still had to work hard with the world to change the attitude of the world powers towards Japan's actions from opposition to approval, or at least indifference, and then further recognize the puppet state. This is what Japan has been striving for. Naturally, the result has been quite successful. Although the recognition of the puppet state is not yet so fast, the attitude of indifference has been achieved.</p>
<p>However, China has in fact submitted, but it has not yet recognized the puppet state. Secondly, the existence of the Soviet Union is also a major annoyance to the development of Japanese imperialism. How can China be made to move from factual submission to simply recognizing the puppet state? How to drive the Soviet Union away so that it can develop without hindrance? This is what Japan is currently racking its brains to plan and deal with. And the current tension in North China and the deepening of the North China crisis day by day are precisely the manifestation of this plan of Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's control of North China by force, making it impossible for North China to have a moment of peace, while at the same time peeking into Chahar and Suiyuan, is aimed at: 1. Forcing our country to recognize the puppet state and conducting direct negotiations under the coercion of force; 2. Challenging the Soviet Union and forcing the Soviet Union to retreat. In addition, treating North China in the same way as it treated the Eastern Provinces in the past, secretly controlling the economic and political lifeline of North China, and when the time is right, it will further occupy North China north of the Yellow River. This is the origin of the deepening North China crisis.</p>
<p>The Eastern Provinces have been lost, and North China is under the control of Japanese military force. In the near future, Japan will inevitably further take North China in the same way that it took the Eastern Provinces. After North China succeeds, it will then further peer into Central and South China. Although it is another question whether Japan will have more violent conflicts with Britain, the United States, and other countries at that time, in short, Japan's predetermined goal is this. The people of the country should remember that they should not think that local submission can be exchanged for Japan's permanent peace. It must be known that this is a definite step-by-step process for its invasion of China. Its ultimate goal is the whole of China!</p>
<h3 id="e260">Freedom of Occupation and Marriage and Social Relations <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>If we were to statistically analyze all the suicide incidents in society, then the results obtained would be… perhaps more than half would be due to economic oppression—unemployment, no way out—and the lack of freedom in marriage! We can definitely say this. Indeed, a lot of participants' energy, various colors of ink, and the pages of various newspapers have been spent discussing and researching these two personal problems of modern youth - occupation and marriage; but in fact, because of such incidents, they are still circulating like deeply rooted ones in all strata of society, increasing rather than decreasing and not getting the slightest solution. Therefore, in general, scholars who are bored and insensitive, if they hear about this kind of problem, they will appear to be overwhelmed and annoyed, because they have long regarded it as "old news." But the facts have not told us that this problem cannot be so simple.</p>
<p>Originally, the problem of occupation and marriage is not a simple isolated problem. They have a close relationship with the entire society, and this is seen and admitted by everyone except those who are willing to only consult the "one-sided" for a lifetime. Moreover, in the past historical process of mankind, it has already indicated to us that… a society, in an era and under a system, has its different kinds of social phenomena and the sum of its key relationships; and in a different society, all kinds of spiritual relationships——general social phenomena——are determined and dominated by its material economic relations. Well, since we have recognized these realistic and objective conditions… occupation and marriage must be governed by objective material conditions, then it is not difficult for us to understand the so-called freedom of occupation and marriage in the current stage of society.</p>
<p>Various capitalist powers have a direct relationship with China, and this is something that no one would deny, right? Therefore, if we want to understand our society today, we must also know them. Isn't it already early? In all aspects, it can be seen that… within the various capitalist countries, and on the world stage of mutual struggle among the various imperialist countries, all the contradictions of the capitalist system have been deepened and sharpened to the greatest extent. This is what has made the entire national economy of various capitalist countries "periodic," "sudden," and constantly declining. Due to this capitalist widespread panic, a powerful "world economic panic" was generated, which shocked and agitated every corner of the world.</p>
<p>Our China, of course, is not qualified to become a capitalist country, but it has always become a large market for free competition among various capitalist powers… In this way, our originally unsound and mixed economic organization, under the agitation of this great wave of the "world economic panic," can only "doubly" follow them—the widespread panic of capitalism—and decline, decline! At the same time, the strengthening of the distance between the various strata of society has undoubtedly become a "direct proportion." Look! The great collapse of the entire rural economy, the bankruptcy, decline, and collapse of the middle class—small merchants, small farmers, salaried workers, etc.—have caused a shocking surge in the number of unemployed and all kinds of social pathologies… factory and shop closures, labor-management disputes, sharp increases in prisoners, suicides… are all alarming and sad facts that arise in response to the times!</p>
<p>Enough, these phenomena are enough to give us extremely clear instructions; in this "doubly" declining current stage, "survival of the fittest" is the main condition, competition, struggle, exclusion... are the most personal skills. In this way, to want "freedom" in occupation today, of course, there is no way to talk about it. But there are exceptions, and that is only because in this social and economic organization, economics is the supreme authority, so only by getting help from it can we have "freedom" today! As for the problem of freedom of marriage, this magazine has discussed it a lot, and its conclusion is… in today's everything is commodified, this—marriage autonomy and the free love of preconditions—is of course no exception, so this is nothing more than the "patent" of the rich, and at the same time it is just the free competition of money and incense powder exchange and buying and selling! In short… it cannot escape the domination of the social environment! The reason why every problem becomes "old news" is because it is "always talking about old news," right—"always" talked about by people and still "old" is "existing"—in this way, it clearly tells us that this kind of problem cannot be solved just by talking about it on the mouth or on paper. Young friends! Now, only by relying on yourselves, according to the "route" and instructions that have come down from the historical process, recognizing all the "realities" that are constantly developing today, to determine your own "trend" and assume the proper "mandate," can you obtain the true "freedom" that you need!</p>
<h3 id="e261">The Spring Scenery is Good <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jun</p>
<p>Leaning on my cane, I lengthened my gaze and looked out over the distance. A large patch of red clouds resting on the treetops immediately reminded me of the two sentences I had copied when my teacher ordered me to write a spring outing record when I was a child as a descriptive language: "The fragrant grass is fresh and beautiful, and the fallen flowers are colorful."</p>
<p>I have no feelings, let alone any thoughts! In fact, there is no room for these! At this moment, I tried my best to abandon the old thoughts accumulated in my brain and let these fresh elements of life really nourish me. A gloomy young man should no longer cling to the things that have passed away. If he does not want to look forward to the future emptily, he must at least really enjoy the present minute, second, and even flash.</p>
<p>"When facing the wine, sing aloud, how much of life is there? Like the morning dew, there are not many days left." Friends, is this life, like the morning dew, to be missed lightly? The past has left you ruthlessly; the future is vague.</p>
<p>"Only nature is infinitely rich," I said repeatedly as I walked. People on the main road brushed past me in twos and threes. I didn't bother to look at them, but the voices of their easy conversations often reached my ears, always giving me a different feeling than in the past… the world is not all cold and terrible.</p>
<p>My body moved forward leisurely with my footsteps. Finally, I stopped by a ditch. The water flowing in the ditch, of course, cannot be compared with the gurgling spring water, but the clarity of the water may not necessarily be inferior to the spring water. However, spring water is admired, while ditch water is despised, which really makes me feel something. Yes, ditch water is ordinary, just irrigating… spring water, on the other hand, is not. This is Hupao, this is the No. 1 spring in the world. A generation of men of letters with leisure and elegance are willing to spend their precious ink to write a grand stroke and inscribe such elegant names; as for ditch water, people almost don't bother to look at it. What I don't understand is… apart from the surface having a peculiar interest, what else does spring water actually have? The reason why spring water is admired is probably because of its appearance. ——This can really show the general state of the world, emphasizing appearance and neglecting content. It is like this for things, and why should people treat it differently?</p>
<p>I stared into the ditch and saw countless tadpoles burrowing against the mud on both sides of the water. Balls of small black animals floated in my eyes for a moment without stopping. Isn't this ball of small animals the most appropriate microcosm of human beings? —Unconsciously busy seeking survival, but eventually dying, generation after generation, without interruption.</p>
<p>The heat of the sun penetrated my clothes and made my back abnormally hot. I had turned from the main road onto a field bank just wide enough for one person to walk. Looking at a glance, the dense peach trees were lined up in front of me like infinite people. At this moment, I no longer wanted to imagine anything else, and I just basked in this atmosphere here!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of singing came from the peach forest. Obviously, it was a duet…</p>
<p>The eight-piece skirt flutters in the wind, and the little sister's wedding date will arrive in the blink of an eye; I'm not used to strangers everywhere, dear brother, what do you think is good? … … … … … … … … … … The eight-piece skirt flutters in the wind, how can I bear my little sister marrying someone else? Let's pack our bags and leave together, you and I will grow old together.</p>

<h3 id="e263">The Flower-Selling Girl <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Rose</p>
<p>Women, from the moment they are born, possess a bewitching allure. That fair skin, those cherry lips, that graceful figure—since ancient times, they have intoxicated countless men. And that voice is also enchanting enough.</p>
<p>"Gardenia, White Orchid!"</p>
<p>It is a clear and moving voice, like a mechanical alarm clock, that awakens me from my dreams every morning at a fixed time.</p>
<p>"Gardenia, White Orchid," one cry follows another, sung from one end of the alley to the other, like a melody containing a charming rhythm. This melody is sung year-round in the early morning, only changing with the seasons. Sometimes it sings of "roses," sometimes of "hydrangeas," sometimes of "tuberose," sometimes of "chrysanthemums," sometimes of "wintersweet," and sometimes of "narcissus." But the melody is always the same, using the same rhythm, sung in the quiet early morning.</p>
<p>Sometimes I seem to dream of a strange realm, a beautiful celestial music vibrating in the air. Then, I would habitually feel as if some force was urging me, and I would struggle to open my eyes. A very careful, low knock would come from the door, followed by another charming and clear cry, "Sir, would you like white orchids?"</p>
<p>I had grown accustomed to hearing this rhythm, accustomed to experiencing this scene. The flower-selling girl had also become accustomed to walking into my door. Every day she walked into my door, every day she brought me fresh flowers, and every day she gave me a deeper impression. And so we became familiar with each other.</p>
<p>She was still an innocent girl, only fifteen years old, but she already had a job and was making a living for herself! From spring to summer, from autumn to winter, every morning she used the same clear voice to peddle flowers. This was her profession, yet her clear voice was even more moving than the flowers, arousing people's pity.</p>
<p>One day last week, I woke up at the usual time, but the rhythm of the flower-selling girl that I was accustomed to hearing was silent. I waited and waited, but the image I was accustomed to seeing no longer appeared before my eyes. Thus, every morning when I woke up, I would feel disappointed, as if I had lost something. Every day I waited for that lost thing to return, but every day I was disappointed.</p>
<p>Today, I woke up again at the usual time—it seemed as if that same rhythm was coming from the alley! I excitedly hoped for that careful, low sound... but it came... sang from one end of the alley to the other, but did not sing to my door. So, I got out of bed again in disappointment, opened the window, and looked towards the place where the rhythm was coming from. But it was no longer the image I was accustomed to seeing. It was an elderly woman and an even younger girl. So, under the pretext of buying flowers, I called them over and casually inquired about the previous flower-selling girl. It turned out that the elderly woman was her mother, and the younger girl was her younger sister. And what about her? She had caught the eye of the master in the Wang mansion and was going to be a concubine.</p>
<p>"Isn't she still very young?" I asked. "That's precisely why someone wants her, because she's young! Like me, my age is almost the same as my son-in-law, but I'm old, who wants me?... But my daughter isn't that young anymore, she'll be sixteen next year!... Now I'm bringing this younger daughter out to sell flowers, she's only eight years old!"</p>
<p>"Hmm, women, are just like flowers, you have to pick the ones that are just budding. Women, are valuable only in their youth. 'Old, who wants them?'" I murmured to myself.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Further on the Marriage Problem <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am now twenty-four years old, and my parents will be marrying me off at the end of this year. Originally, I was betrothed when I was around ten years old. In the years 1929 or 1930, that never-before-seen fiancée of mine unfortunately died of illness, which I didn't particularly mind. But my mother regretted it. I thought that from then on, I could choose my own wife. I even declared to my parents that they shouldn't bother on my behalf in the future. However, no matter how much you spend your breath, they won't listen to you.</p>
<p>In the early summer of 1931, they actually carried out the betrothal ceremony without even notifying me. When I was still studying at a school in Shanghai, I returned home for summer vacation and learned of this, but there was no way to reverse it. After the fact, I heard about the process of this matter and the background of the other party. Initially, the other party was a tenant of my aunt's family, and they naturally became familiar and close through daily meetings. My mother took a liking to that daughter because of her gentle and quiet nature, and also because she had the skill of knitting socks. My father, on the other hand, was rather careless and never gave a definite expression of approval. So, the completion of the matter was entirely due to my mother's opinion alone. Her family was originally in the city of Wuxi, but they moved to our town after losing their jobs. The entire family's living expenses depended on the income from the two daughters' knitting socks. The elder daughter was already married, so life became even more difficult. It was already difficult to barely maintain their livelihood, let alone educate their daughters.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been several disputes within the family, and I have shed many bitter tears. My reasons for resisting are that there is no basis in mutual love, and that the other party is illiterate. Many of my friends have advised me not to resist this matter, and have even explained it to me. If she is illiterate, you can teach her after marriage, and she may be able to write letters and read books. They even congratulated me, saying that I would have a financially independent wife.</p>
<p>I have gone through many troubles over this matter. Should I compromise? Or should I refuse? Whenever a stimulus to move forward comes, I will strive to arouse a rebellious mentality. But whenever I encounter some discouragement, I will be like a sheep, justifying myself and thinking that there is no need to cause trouble. Sometimes,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>I feel that resistance is powerless, and I think of not interfering in this matter. What worries me the most is that since then, the fire of youth seems to have been extinguished, all ambitions have been dispelled, and I dare not even think about courageous thoughts anymore. I believe that if it is already like this before marriage, how much more lifeless and destructive it will be after marriage. If I compromise, I know that I will be tightly bound, with no chance of turning over, and I fear that I will end my life silently and without spirit. Although after resisting, what will happen in the end is still unknown, I am certain that resistance will lead to a breakdown in the emotional relationship between parents and children, and will hurt their old hearts. As for indifference, I know that things will eventually explode one day and cannot be escaped. So, the question now is whether I should follow my heart and compromise, or respect my own wishes and resist?</p>
<p>If I resist, then the one hundred yuan betrothal gift will naturally not be returned, and whether the other party may have reasons to refuse to dissolve the engagement and how I will appease the anger of the elders, and how I will comfort their pain.</p>
<p>I know very well that the main reason my mother is marrying me off is to relieve her of her responsibilities, and at the same time to gain someone to help manage the household affairs. As for me, I may not be satisfied. This kind of behavior of abandoning one's wife at home and letting her live a lonely life is unkind. Other problems may be put aside, but I cannot teach her to read. First, I have my own affairs, so I have no spare time. Second, whether she has the energy to learn is also a question. So, if I am to compromise, my mental suffering goes without saying, and as for my career, not only is there no hope of help, but there is even the hatred of obstruction. Guo Sumin replies: This letter was forwarded by the Reading Guidance Department of the newspaper's circulation library. Mr. Guo's situation is extremely common. It is a problem that should exist in this society of rapid transition between the old and the new.</p>
<p>Of course, the union of men and women should be based on love, and marriage should be autonomous. But the editor has said before that although marriage is a lifelong event, it is not the only thing in life. A happy marriage is of course a lifelong happiness, but an unhappy marriage does not mean that all happiness is lost. Therefore, young people in general should be very careful about marriage and should not be careless in the slightest. That is indeed right, but if one puts one's whole mind on the issue of a spouse, it seems to be taking too narrow a view of life.</p>
<p>We believe that marriage is like eating, although it is indispensable, it has no great significance. Therefore, we do not want young people in general to create the motto "living for marriage or love." Therefore, we believe that as long as a spouse does not hinder the career you wish to pursue, and you can get along peacefully, even if their appearance and talent are somewhat inferior, it does not mean that your life will have any regrets. Therefore, your great dissatisfaction with the marriage arranged for you by your mother seems to be too deeply prejudiced. You must know that if you fall in love with a very modern girl now, you will of course feel very happy at the time, but if your material conditions are not sufficient to support her, this happiness may not last forever, and there may be days when you regret it repeatedly. Of course, this cannot be generalized. Modern girls certainly can be hardworking, but they are ultimately in the minority. Therefore, the editor believes that you should not blindly oppose the marriage arranged by your family, but you should see what the other party is like and whether you can get along peacefully in the future. Illiteracy is indeed a flaw, but not being sensible is even more harmful. If she is illiterate but still compatible with you, it does not mean that you cannot marry. Therefore, the editor believes that what you should do now is to try your best to get closer to the other party and observe her character. If you feel that there is no major conflict between her and you, then insisting on breaking off the engagement can be said to be completely unreasonable. However, after further observation, you must completely change the attitude you have adopted in this letter. You should judge based on whether your personalities and interests are close, but you should not use talent, appearance, and learning as standards.</p>
<p>After this careful consideration, then firmly talk about marriage or breaking off the engagement. There is no need to shed bitter tears now, and there is no need to be depressed.</p>

<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>It seemed the servant girl came to say, the Sixth Master asks you to go quickly. The Madam immediately rose and headed toward the new house. Upon entering that flower hall, she saw the Master holding a long strip of cloth, tied into a knot and looped around their eldest son's neck who lay sprawled out on the bed. He held one end himself, and gave the other to her, saying, "Here, pull harder!" The Madam uncontrollably grasped it. The Sixth Master tugged forcefully, the Madam's head swam and her heart leaped, so she didn't pull very hard. Their eldest son's head and body were dragged to one side, and he suddenly moved the cloth strip with both hands, taking the opportunity to flip himself up and push the Master to the ground, the Madam also falling. He produced a pistol from his side, and aimed at the Master's chest, firing! The Sixth Master's chest bore a hole, red blood gushing forth! The Madam lunged forward to embrace the Sixth Master, weeping loudly. He pointed at the Master, cursing loudly, "You refuse to recognize me as your son, and I refuse to recognize you as my father! If you try to strangle me, I'll shoot you dead! Mother, get up, he brought it on himself, ignore him, let's go!" Upon hearing these words, the Madam was furious, bellowing, "It's no crime for a father to kill his son, but for a son to kill his father, you unfilial and unprincipled wretch, you lawless brute!" As the Madam spoke, she meant to fight him to the death, but she heard a loud bang, and he fired! The Madam felt a pain in her chest, and with a loud cry—she woke up! It turned out it was a nightmare. She was drenched in sweat, her chest still aching. Outside the window, a torrential rain pattered down. The Madam sat up, pondering the dream, "If you don't kill him, he'll kill you! He even shot me, that beast!" The Sixth Master lay stiff on the ground, blood gushing from his chest—that image faded and reappeared in her mind, and the more she thought about it, the more frightened she became, so the Madam lay back down on the bed, covering herself with the sheets to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day. At dusk, Jian Guang was bored and alone in the new house, leaning against the door of the flower hall, staring blankly at the darkening sky and the drizzling rain. Pu Ning, that old bastard, led Lian Sun and Gui Sun in. Jian Guang was startled, retreating into the door. When she saw that there was no one else behind them, she was relieved. Lian Sun spoke first, "Where's Number One off to?"</p>
<p>"He's back, all better now," Gui Sun added.</p>
<p>The tone of their voices didn't seem to harbor any ill intentions, so Jian Guang hastily offered them seats, saying, "Isn't he just wandering about everywhere?" Pu Ning struck a match to light the lamp, and Jian Guang turned to them, asking, "Business good?"</p>
<p>Lian Sun said, "Gui Sun's made a fortune, the tax on foreign sugar went up, so Chaozhou sugar's raking in the money."</p>
<p>Gui Sun said, "He's the one making a fortune, passing off Japanese cloth as Hong Kong cloth, making thousands on a single batch, right?"</p>
<p>Jian Guang smiled slightly and said, "The newspapers are trumpeting about boycotting inferior goods and cutting off economic ties. I said that the merchants in Shantou would get rich again, for sure. What do merchants care about being patriotic? They're actually traitors, selling China to the powers for division, enthusiastic..."</p>
