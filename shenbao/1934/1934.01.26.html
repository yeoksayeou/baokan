<p>時評</p>
<h3>新疆又一警報　舒</h3>
<p>新疆天山南路之最大中心城市。近忽發生巨大變動。在回族酋長支援之下。樹立所謂新政府。此一新政府之内容何如。卽據路透與塔斯兩社所傳亦尚糢糊不明。現在表面上所可知者。第一新政府之領袖爲一回族商人第二自保獨立。脫離中國。第三排斥漢人。第四派遣代表與阿富汗王國聯合第五邀集流亡於印度及日本之回人前往編練軍隊。凡此種種。皆足表示新疆省一部分回回人之意見。而其驅逐漢人一語。尤足以挑動回人之情感彼等以爲此種主張。合於歷史的情性。可與漢人相抗。而獲得自决之成果殊不知新疆地界兩大强國之間。回回民族之在新疆者。尚在農業經濟時代不足與商業經濟競爭。一旦獨立。徒爲外人利用。而不悟其將爲印度之續也</p>
<p>漢人之服官於新省者。向多思想頑固之徒。非特政治上無建設而尤使當地回人。滿懷不平。致隣近國家。野心陡熾。時起覬覦。此次回民之反動吾人以道路遥遠。交通阻滯。於彼此關係極相隔膜之際。不欲遽加以嚴切之指摘惟今日新省政治之樞紐。尚在漢人掌握之中。設使省政府方面能知此事之關係重要。急起開誠相與。應付得宜。縱未必卽足以平定亂事。然或可以使此亂事。不再擴大。以徐圖收復了。</p>
<p>夫新省事變。揭穿已久。中央亦早注意及此。曾兩度派遣大員入新就地考察新省以往變遷之原因。與夫今後設計治理之要道。黃慕松氏之宣慰旣成過去。羅文幹氏之考察。甫經歸來。其所以貢獻於中央者。必有切實可行之計劃。故當此南路回民問題突發之際。中央政府自必胸有成算而無煩我人顧慮者也。</p>
<p>新疆地積五百三十六萬主里。人口約計二百五十至三百萬論者或以爲新疆盡屬不毛。人口稀少。氣候甚不適宜。然其實戈璧沙漠。僅占新省全面積五分之一。其妨害人口之生存。阻碍交通之發展。亦至有限。不過因天山之隔致分成南北兩路。而南北兩方。則皆有河流貫注。水草豐美。旣宜牧畜又宜耕作。在天山北路。雖號稱嚴寒。最多亦不過華氏表零下二十度較諸黑龍江省之氣候。實爲佳良。人口之所以稀薄。交通之所以不便。則以國内上下向不注意西北耳。且天山北路。因外蒙之獨立。與蘇聯士西鐵道之成功國防關係更見吃緊。</p>
<p>現在回漢之爭。旣由暗中酬釀而至暴露。就表面觀察。似尚不至十分嚴重惟因新省連年荒亂兵禍相乘。倘彼野心國家。再加以背後之播弄乘機漁利則其變化所至。實有難以預料者。故吾人以爲無論疏勒之事是否確實政府皆應迅速布置。宣布治新方針。使漢民有所依歸。回民及早覺悟以挽回今日之頽勢也。</p>

<p>（東京）　今次議會、以政友會代表床次之擁護議會政治演說、與民政黨代表町田忠治擁護憲政之主張、衆議院空氣極爲緊張、且安藤正純關於軍民離間之演說、有警告軍部輕舉之功效、從來議會對於軍部問題之方針、抛棄其審議國勢之權利、敷衍了事、然今次議會自由發表言論、審議軍部問題、其用意並非在於打倒軍部或反對軍人、乃係擁護議會政治、自五一五事件以來信用掃地之政黨、熱心恢復信用之努力、於此可以窺知矣、（二十五日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　政友會之巨頭床次竹二郎、於質問演說之劈頭、力言擁護憲政、同時高唱政黨有恊力一致大團結之必要、而代表民政黨於二十四日在下院爲質問演說之町田忠治、對床次氏之所論、表示贊成之意、最後更附言、當此難局、政黨恊力一致、實現更强有力之國民政治、爲最大急</p>
<p>務、藉以明示黨之態度、因此更足促成黨内政民提携之空氣、各方面頗爲注目、（二十五日電通電）</p>
<h3>衆院質問嚴厲</h3>
<p>嫉視我國空軍發展</p>
<p>齋藤對時局未樂視</p>
<p>軍人將不再干政乎</p>
<p>（東京）　第三日之衆院已於午後一時二十八分開會、首由八角三郎氏登壇討論海軍第二次補充計畫如下｜</p>
<p>對於將來之軍縮會議、極應樹立根本對策、至於外觀、失策者多、所得者少、如倫敦條約者、有無改訂與廢棄之意向｜</p>
<p>又謂、中國之航空事業、已有美國資本殺到之事實、當局之見解若何、</p>
<p>大角海相乃起而答辯曰｜</p>
<p>立足於國防安全之觀感上、吾人對於軍縮條約或會議等、正在愼重研究其根本方針、</p>
<p>至隣邦中國及蘇聯空軍發達、我方對策、應取切實有效之方法、政府亦正在極力研究中、</p>
<p>次由小川鄉太郎登壇提出質問如下｜</p>
<p>對於偏重軍費之預算、倘經實行、則徒使軍需工業趨於繁榮、而與振興農村無關、結果是使農村與都會不能利益均沾、其不公平、莫此爲甚、究竟是否軍部欲將現在資本主義使之强化｜</p>
<p>又論軍紀問題如下｜</p>
<p>關於軍人干政與軍人之政治論、軍事當局對此有何感想、</p>
<p>再論財政與經濟問題如下｜</p>
<p>所謂未便明言之增稅時期、其意義是否爲昭和十年度尚不實施耶、在惡政通貨膨脹未發生以前、應否有综行增稅之必要、</p>
<p>該氏並論及其他貿易關係與貿易均衡政策、要求政府答辯、高橋藏相乃起而答曰｜</p>
<p>對於軍需工業家須課以特别稅云云、其意在增稅之後國家財政轉佳、但一方面亦有不能不發行紅字公債者、是以不辦爲愈、</p>
<p>一兩年内、暫不加稅、則國民留有資力、易於活動、故不宜操之過激也、</p>
<p>次由大角海相答辩曰｜</p>
<p>現在供職之軍人、禁止干涉政治、自當遵守、倘有此項不法之軍人、即當取締、固不待說、但對於如何左右國力之政治、雖屬現職軍人、亦不得不有所關心、由此項意義而養成其政治常識、亦不能謂爲無理耳、</p>
<p>繼由林陸相發言如下｜</p>
<p>軍需品之定購、卽中流以下之工業家亦行之矣、國防與政治爲不可分離之關係、是以過於憂慮國防者、或起而研究政治、或作政治上之議論、是亦情理上應有之情形、不能謂爲絶無其事也、小川氏復質問曰｜</p>
<p>兹據陸海兩相所答辯、其口吻似乎認可軍人干政、首相對於此項答案有何見解、</p>
<p>齋藤首相起而答曰｜</p>
<p>兩相所答並無不合理之處、</p>
<p>陸相又稱｜</p>
<p>本人所答、並非認可干涉之意、</p>
<p>經此番解釋、於是小川氏之質問乃告一段落、繼由政友會之原口氏開始質問｜觀察現今國際情勢、當然以軍備爲必要、但藉口非常時期、使軍費異常增加、國民當不能無疑、其將何以解釋乎、此乃關於軍費預算問題之追究、當由高橋藏相答之矣、其後復由中野正剛氏以尖銳之論調起而質問、議塲空氣頓形緊張、兹錄其質問大要如左｜</p>
<p>首相及其他閣僚、對於時局之認識、彼此相差甚遠、外相動輒以危機爲口頭禪、而對於最近列强巨頭之放言、堂堂予以酬應、究竟對於外交本質有無要求調節之决心、尚乞答覆、關於對蘇俄之問題、有所恃而無恐、而於對蘇問題之解决、是否抱有積極之熱情、亦請明白作答、</p>
<p>關於安定財界之認識、可否倣傚美國之聯邦產業委員會、而設立半行政半司法之產業檢察關機、有無此種意趣、其次關於農業問題、對政府更放其激烈之射擊、繼談財政問題、其結論如下｜</p>
<p>危機並不僅限於一九三六年、要在有劃期改革以應付之、現在我國貿易慘遭聯合經濟之打擊、至今情出不已、乃有出口統制之辦法、及生產統制之組織、但生產統制與大衆福利、使其一致之道果何如、於是發生金融統制之必要、與經濟參謀本部之必須設立、對内自給自足、實非新興日本之精神所在、蓋非常時期、有不可避免之情形、當此局勢、閣僚諸公之認識如何、</p>
<p>中野氏之質問題過一時間有半、最後由齋藤首相答辯曰｜</p>
<p>目下之時局、政府並未樂觀、應由全國國民協力一致、以打開難局耳、</p>
<p>隨後各相均未置答、中野氏復登壇要求答覆、議塲爲之騷然、廣田外相乃作簡單之解釋曰｜</p>
<p>處今日複雜之國際關係、似宜勿作極端之言辭、吾人應愼重其事、</p>
<p>後由中島商相答辯、乃散會、（二十五日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>貴族院將繼起</h3>
<p>質問軍紀問題</p>
<p>（東京）　貴院以軍部前所發表關於軍民離間運動之聲明書、齋藤首相在衆院答辯時、稱爲完全不知、認爲出諸意外、且其發表之動機非常薄弱、將由各派恊議之後、調查眞相、於適當之機會、提出緊急質問、（廿五日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　上院議員關直彥、關於思想問題及綱紀軍紀之振肅問題、决向齋藤首相·鳩山文相·大角海相·林陸相等、提出彈劾的質問、關係此綱紀問題之議會空氣、頗爲緊張、恐未許政府高枕而臥、（廿五日電通電）</p>
<h3>廣田與若槻同調</h3>
<p>日本人如服淸凉劑</p>
<p>（東京）　民政黨認廣田外相對於町田忠紹關於一九三五年國際危機質問之答辯、與若槻總裁平常所抱意見完全一致、廣田此次答辯、可以解消國民之憂慮、社會的不安因此自然可消滅、（二十五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>意輿論譏廣田</h3>
<p>藉和平之名行侵略之實</p>
<p>日本無信已使英美戒備</p>
<p>歐宜團結對付遠東問題</p>
<p>羅馬　聞日本駐羅馬大使奉本國政府訓令、向意政府提出關於意國報紙評論日本一事之友好勸告、赫斯特系報紙近所載意相墨索里尼一文、日政府尤爲注意、同時意國各報對日外相廣田於國會開幕日之演說、不復緘默、紛載論文、評駁日本爲遠東和平柱石之主張、法西斯大會重要議員演壇報記者達望柴蒂著有一文、語含譏刺、謂日本主張和平之結果、厥爲美國决計建造戰艦一百二十艘、英·澳·紐絲綸代表在新加坡海軍會議中表示恐慌、該文之結語曰、歐洲各國亟當團結以對付遠東問題云（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間數家報紙、對日本外相廣田最近在貴族院之演說、均有評論、汎繫黨勞工報結論曰、「日本式之和平、豈東亞唯一可能之和平乎、」該報引廣田所用以解釋其所謂和平政策之言、以與遠東事實相對照、並謂依廣田所言日本所求者、歸結言之、和平而已、然而日本擴大勢力之計畫、仍繼續進行、曾不願予以停止、日本欲征服東亞之時、有某一國無論以何方法阻其進行、日本卽視此國爲威脅和平、凖備戰爭、以吾人所見、此處所謂某國、卽暗指蘇俄云、論壇報亦謂、日本之意、以爲各國對於由日本發動而演成之事實、能予以承認、乃爲和平、由目下言之、此種已成之事實、一方爲「滿洲國」之成立、一方爲熱河方面之行動、日本在熱河、除遇中國微弱之抵抗以外、可謂爲所欲爲、至國聯會行政院之形式上活動、則未免令人發笑、據廣田所言、日</p>
<p>本自脫離日内瓦之後、「其與他國商務外交之關係、較之以前、更見密切、更見親善、殊爲幸事、信乎」論壇報旋述英美之海軍問題、謂美國旣已通過一百二十艘軍艦之建築案、英國方面亦於新加坡巡洋艦坎特號上舉行海軍會議、凡遠東英國艦隊司令均參加焉、此兩種事實、卽爲英美對日本憂慮之跡象、美國之所關心者、在於增加軍艦、充實海軍、以爲一九三六年討論海軍條約之地步、英國之所關心者、在保障澳洲紐西蘭等處之安全、因此等地方、人口稀少、固日本帝國主義目光之所注視者也、云云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英海軍司令返漢</h3>
<p>（漢口）　英國駐漢海軍司令邱禮敦、月初赴長江上游巡視該國兵艦、二十五日午乘艦返漢、（二十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>歐洲多事之秋</p>
<h3>法德軍縮爭持奥德齟齬又起</h3>
<p>奥向德抗議指揮國社運動</p>
<p>倘無滿意答覆將起訴國聯</p>
<p>（柏林）　奥國今日已向德國正式提出外交上之抗議、謂德國不應暗中指揮奥國之國社主義運動、並聲明若德國覆文不能使奥國滿意、則奥國將訴諸國聯云、據可靠方面豫料、德國覆文將不承認此項責任、故國聯不日又將遭遇重大之爭案、（廿四日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國假裝聾啞奥揆已至忍無可忍</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　奥總理杜爾夫斯所稱奥國對於國社黨之活動、現覺忍無可忍一節、已使歐洲各國當局轉注其目光於柏林與維也納、杜爾夫斯在一星期前曾牒致德國、嚴重抗議奥國内政之受干涉奥國、至今尚未答覆、留心近世史者乃指德國裝聾作啞、一般人所慮者、國際公法之辯論旣出演於世界舞台、軍縮問題又將擱置於幕後矣、</p>
<h3>奥德土地爭執控諸國聯未必得計</h3>
<p>奥總理之意、非至萬不得已時不欲請求國聯制止德國國社黨之宣傳、蓋知此舉不僅使國聯爲難、且亦使德奥兩國現有之惡感愈增惡劣也、英國以爲德國並未侵犯奥國土地、奥國遽訴諸國聯、是否得計、能否有效、不無可疑、雖國聯盟約第十一條規定國聯遇有危及國際關係之情事時、得出塲干涉、惟物證未備、恐國際公法學者之激昻言論不能發生光明、徒然引起憤激耳、奥人現皆爭談政治、但眞正難題、殆在經濟毘連德國之數省、極欲解决兩國間之爭執、彼等不滿於杜爾夫斯、非無愛國心、但因對德商業乃其生存之唯一方法也、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>巴黎方面盛傳日德有秘密勾結說</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　此間一般人對於軍縮問題、忽呈懷疑之態度、最近有一種謡傳、日本有與德國秘密結約之說、據記者所得之消息、則爲日本鑒於美國承認蘇俄事、深覺將來日人舆力之孤單、加之美俄互相恊助製造軍艦及飛機等事、尤爲可懼、再有德日兩國均係退出國聯、然目前對於日内瓦之軍縮事、兩國尚無合作之表示、最近日本駐法大使司徒氏聲明、日本對於目下軍縮會議之情形、似大歐洲化、將來如能注意全世界時局時、日本决可重行加入討論也、美國現在對於國聯軍縮問題、亦與日本採同一態度、因美國不欲干涉歐洲自身之政治問題故也、</p>
<h3>國聯承法意志擬定軍縮三項判决</h3>
<p>法國最近與英相西門及其他如比國羅馬尼亞國及捷克等國代表會商後、對德態度益顯强硬、法國將在國聯會内正式提議擬就軍縮草約、交德國自行决定加入討論與否、而此次會議之成敗、亦惟是賴、兹由記者探得國聯行政院已擬定三項判决如下、（一）法國决不能承認德總理希特勒之提議要求增加德國兵力至三十萬人及保留半軍隊化之組織、（二）軍縮會議預備會可由外交方式進行、但最後之談判、當在日内瓦會塲内當衆舉行之、（三）法國爲表示其對軍縮會之誠意及犧牲起</p>
<p>見、將所有提案送交日内瓦軍縮會云、最近軍縮會趨勢、英法兩國確係合作、美日俄三國將來亦均可有代表參加、並於遠東軍縮及一切軍事行動、將有詳細之討論、至於德國則其結果定可稍佔便宜也、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>法德軍縮異見英閣覓求調解基礎</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　下午内閣舉行會議、由首相麥唐納主席、討論曆一點半鐘之久、議程中列有主要問題兩項、一爲軍縮問題、一爲英法商務關係、討論軍縮問題時、外相西門將昨日内閣軍縮問題小組委員會開會之報告書交閣僚閱看、其内容爲專門機關所擬之若干建議案、凖備作爲英國從新調解之基礎者、一般人以爲此項建議、係根據下列各種意義、（一）减少「軍縮試騐</p>
<p>期間」之重要性、覓求一種名詞、俾德國關於軍備平等之願望、得以滿足、（二）德國要求三十萬軍額、對方可以承認者僅爲二十萬、擬於兩者之間求一折衷辦法、（三）此外對於軍械、亦覓求折衷辦法、特别希望法國對於本身縮减軍械能規定時期及數目、惟以德國同時能履行其所負之義務爲條件耳、英政府僅擬以通常外交手續、向法德兩國提出前項建議、接洽進行之時、此項建議尚可加以修改、内閣於討論軍縮之後、旋又審查奥國問題、倫敦人士之意、不甚願意將此事向國聯會提出、因國聯會目下對於此事、殊難作有實效之處理、若由地理上比較有關係之各國出爲處理、則爲比較有益云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>巴爾幹條約内容包含五點</h3>
<p>相約各不侵犯</p>
<p>爭端聽憑公斷</p>
<p>本月杪可望正式成立</p>

<p>英海軍會議秘密裏進行</p>
<p>（倫敦）　新加坡海軍會議、昨日在駐華英國海軍總司令德萊雅爵士之旗艦坎特號開會後、至今無一字發表、雖海軍部聲明此爲一種自動的尋常事件、但一般輿情咸覺此次會議、實爲作與帝國與世界與新加坡本身有極重要關係的决議之初步、蓋爲顧及遠東澳洲太平洋之交通計、須决定海軍根據地之前途也、出席之代表、爲駐華駐東印度駐澳之海軍總司令、彼等負有保護太平洋西部英國利益之責任、議程中必列有使新加坡新時代化而成强固之海軍根據地、英政府對新加坡軍港、雖主張草草之政策、但現有理由可信一九三零年帝國會議所延緩之工程序、不日將積極繼續進行之、此項工程中有建造加倍大船塢·修理軍艦廠·及增固一般防務、目下東方水面英軍艦之需修者、須駛回本國爲之、若太平洋有設備周到之根據地、則可免去數千哩之航程也、（廿四日路透電）</p>

<p>木材進口免稅</p>
<p>火柴准許傾銷</p>
<p>俄金輸美弛禁</p>

<h3>錢業領袖秦潤卿發表錢幣革命意見</h3>
<p>最近現金過剩並不感錢荒</p>
<p>發行不兌現幣將益陷絶境</p>
<p>能力本位制萬難行於我國</p>
<p>新聲社云、上海錢業同業公會主席秦潤卿、昨復立法院焦易堂委員函云、易堂先生左右、甬江返棹、獲展手敎、承示錢幣革命一案、救亡圖存、深佩嘉謨、惟是潤卿之愚、以爲能力本位制」之理論、微近幻想、祇能供學者檢討之資、似未易卽時見諸事實、卽以我國而論、自抱布貿絲、進而鑄造貨幣、制爲圜法、數千年來、人民習於使用硬幣、除至近日、紙幣風行、然莫不以十足現金爲凖備、公司或停兌、恐慌立致、遠始不論、</p>
<p>武漢創痕未復　近如武漢現金集中一役、至今時逾七年、鄂渚金融、尚未回復舊觀、當時持票人顚沛流離之狀、猶在目前、夫以有限之不兌現紙幣、行於一隅遺禍尚如此之烈、矧如劉君計劃之發行漫無限制之代用券、其不驅全國人民塡於溝壑者幾希、比來現金過剩之聲、洋溢國内、未聞有錢荒之說、若謂農村貧瘠、此乃根本由於天災人禍、農村破產所致、卽使實現劉君計劃、而恃以領取代用券者、厥惟財產、彼鄉曲編氓、家無担石、求謀一飽、尚不可得、何來資財易取券幣、且代用券濫發之結果、必使物價暴騰、工資縱能增高、而速度萬難幾及、流毒所及、非使全國農工盡趨絶路一挺而走險不止、今夫世界雖日在演進之中、而「紙本位」三字、迄今尚爲經濟學上之一不祥名詞、</p>

<p>難迴憶、信如劉君之言、則德國固早已先我行之、宜可一雪戰敗之辱、而無敵於天下矣、奈之何一有出路、立卽更革幣制、燬滅舊日濫發之紙幣、惟恐不盡乎、又若通貨膨脹之說、固爲美國上下所倡導、然美國所患者乃生產過剩、我國所患者乃生產不足、處境截然相反、烏可削足就履且美國之通貨膨脹方案、亦主循序漸進、是故雖以金元王國著稱世界、而發行若干不兌現券之一計劃、審愼徘徊、迄未實現、終其極不過減低金元成分而已、</p>
<p>推克諾克拉西　「技術政治」上之一名詞、原爲彼邦一退伍軍人所創、初未爲學者所重、徒以年來新大陸在不景氣籠罩之下、挽救乏術、美人士於怨望之餘、驟聞其學說之新頴、遂不惜爭相傳播、視爲奇貨、迨羅斯福總統就職、壁壘一新、興計劃逐步成功、於是此「推克諾克拉西」之一語、遂如曇花一現、殆將成爲歷史上之名詞、奈之何人已視同敝屣、而我猶珍如環寳、視爲同道乎、</p>
<p>貨幣需要本少　至謂我國全國上下、每人手中所有銀幣、平均不足三元、卽以爲世亂錢荒之證、更非確確論、吾人固不必遠徴唐虞之治、卽有淸中葉、海内晏然、當時國力之裕、逈非今日所能夢想、試問當時全國人民手中、共有貨幣幾何徴論當時墨西哥之銀幣、尚偶見於沿海諸省、卽制錢之總値、尚不及今時銅幣之百什、是可知貨幣之多寡、無關國力蓋全視人民生活程度之演進、以爲消長、譬之美國生活奇昂、尋常工資日非五六元不可、故其貨幣之需要量自宏、每人手中所有之貨幣亦自多、英德法日、以此類推、若夫吾國生活幼稚、每日二三角之工資、尚祇見於通商大埠、而農工偕級一家七口、每年數十金卽可温飽、貨幣之需要旣少、則手中之所有不能與英美並提、若加膨脹、是無異以小兒之腹、食以成人之量、有不脹滿夭殤者歟、要之「能力本位制、以蘇俄之地位、而猶有所顧忌不敢施行者、而謂我國行之可收長治久安之效、潤卿不學、實莫測其高深焉、遠辱明問、敢貢愚慮、一孔之見、幸恕率直、專復敬候勛綏</p>

<h3>招商局同華輪被撞受損</h3>
<p>因北康輪在白河追逐越航之故</p>

<p>報告原因　同華輪船主姜長慶、將被撞眞相報告總局、大致謂、同華輪自天津在本月十九日上午十一時十八分、駛至白河内、現當氷河時間、水勢自較平時爲淺、而同華正在前駛之時、突有北方輪船公司北康號輪、亦從天津開出、在同華之後、旋欲追過同華、該船突開特别快車、急行前進、與同華接近將越出時、北康將本船之外舷鋼板等盡行撞壞、猶幸同華躱避迅速、未至肇成慘禍、</p>

<h3>華捲烟廠公會開會紀</h3>
<p>華洋稅收不平等之利弊</p>
<p>國聞社云、昨日下午二時、上海市華商捲烟廠同業公會、假四馬路中央西菜社禮堂、補開會員大會、計到會員二十八人、内四人係代表而無正式信件、乃改爲談話會、臨時主席鄔挺生、開會如儀、先由主席報告財部允撥菸業發展費洋三十萬元之經過、略謂、華商資本薄弱、常受洋商之經濟壓迫、故請政府於稅收項下、撥欵五十萬、以資發展營業、後經鄙人與沈包二君、代表請願、當由孔財長允撥三十萬、繼又討論保管問題、因此欵係補助華商、當然由華商保管等情、次黃子屏君發表政府更改稅收辦法、致影響營業、略謂、根據統稅公報及稅務公報、當實行三級稅時、英美烟公司每月銷三○四七二張、計大洋二、四一七、四零三、八二二元、華商銷六八、四二二張、計大洋二、零零六、二五二、六四七元、自改爲二級稅後、英美烟公司每月銷四八、八零八張、計大洋二、七二六、三九二、五二二元、華商銷四四、三二三張、計大洋二、五五四、四六六、九九六元、由此可看出自改爲二級稅後、華商少賣二四、零零九張、卽少賣二四、零九九箱菸、而稅反增加五四八、二一四、三四和元、致外大多賣出一八、三三六張、卽多賣出一八、三三六箱菸、但稅收只增三零八、九八八、七○○元、二級稅與華商之不利如此、吾人應當設法改良之、且改稅一次、華商烟卽少賣許多包、兹列表於下</p>
<p>稅級　皖（宿松）　鄂（黃岡）　浙（新昌）　豫（冠軍）　鄂（廣水）　豫（均州）　年銷總數</p>
<p>七級　一二、○○○包　八○、○○○包　五○、○○○包　三○、○○○包　一○、○○○包　五○、○○○包　三九○、○○○包</p>
<p>三級　九○、○○○包　五○、○○○包　四○、○○○包　二○、○○○包　三○、○○○包　二六五、○○○包</p>
<p>二級　四○、○○○包　三○、○○○包　一五、○○○包　一五、○○○包　一一五、○○○包</p>
<p>故每次更改稅則、銷數益减、黃君報告後、因人數不足、改爲下次討論云、</p>
<p>會後、記者晤黃君談及捲烟稅華洋之不平等現象、據謂、華商本小、只能從事營業、下等烟每箱平均資本六十五元、乃現抽稅八十元、此種抽稅、以百分計、係値百抽一百二十、而洋商本大、多營上等菸、每箱平均資本洋二百二十元、乃抽稅洋八十元、以百分計、只百分之三十六耳、此種不平等之待遇、吾人實不能接受、但吾人並非抗捐、據鄙人意見、無論華商洋商、苟均値百抽百、政府每年並可增加稅收六千萬元云云、</p>

<h3>海格路侯家弄鄉間黑夜捕盜雙方格門</h3>
<p>荒地上雙方相持歷時許久</p>
<p>一華捕中槍傷臂仍予搏戰</p>
<p>｜兩傷盜先後投醫院被拘｜</p>
<p>昨晨二時許、滬西海格路侯家弄·華界·公共租界·法租界交界處、發生捕匪開槍格鬥案、結果當塲擒獲一盜、醫院内拘獲一盜、一盜在逸未</p>
<p>獲、槍傷華捕一名、兹將詳情記之如下、</p>
<p>兄弟勤儉持家　滬西海格路中國殯儀館對面侯家弄（卽第三埂五弄）、係處華租交界之處、地僻人稀、僅有十餘鄉人、列户而居、内有王毛囝·王書東·者、係弟兄兩人、務農爲業、勤儉持家、雖祖遺產業至微、但以開支省儉、故亦堪温飽、至近年來始稍具積蓄、同時因耕作較忙、兄弟兩人、不克兼顧、乃曾僱用田工一名、相助操作、詎亦竟被匪徒垂涎、</p>
<p>夜半突來盜匪　昨晨一時許、當王氏兄弟及田工小弟等均在睡鄉時、門外突來匪徒數名、往撬王氏宅門、内中一匪、並用手電燈向内照射窺探、詎斯時田工小弟適因便急起床、開門如厠、匪等聞聲、正中下懷、卽分在門外兩旁隠伏、待小弟走出、卽一擁而上、嚇禁聲張、逼其引導入内、分往各房搜刦、毛囝弟兄、亦被驚醒、以無法抵抗、乃卽任其所爲、而匪等亦以王空無所有、大失所望、故不久卽席捲較好衣服等、向外逃逸、</p>
<p>呼盜各方援應　待匪等走出大門、王氏兄弟及田工等、卽狂呼捉强盜、同時四鄰亦聞警接應、匪等見事不妙、卽擬向西奔避、詎斯時適有靜安寺捕房第二四八零號·及三零零二號·兩巡邏華捕、由此經過、聞得警報、並見前面黑影幢幢、正在狂奔、知非善類、乃亟用手電燈探視、並拔步追趕、詎匪等一見華捕在</p>
<p>後緊追、竟情急向後開槍、</p>
<p>華捕中槍受傷　因此兩華捕亦開槍還擊、雙方卽在斯處荒地上、發生激戰、相持許久、第三零零二號華捕右臂上被匪擊中一槍、但該捕並不畏縮、仍與搏戰、未幾但見有兩黑影向地倒下、同時匪方槍聲亦絶、捕等知已受創、乃急上前逮捕、詎竟已失踪、始知匪徒已被逃逸、第二四八零號華捕乃亟將受傷之第三零零二號華捕車送巡捕醫院醫治、一面飛報捕房追緝在逃受傷各匪、</p>
<p>傷盜自投醫院　捕房得報後、卽分電各警政機關、請予注意、一面並通知全市各醫院特别注意來院就診槍傷病人、果至昨晨三時許、白克路寳隆醫院内突來一男子、請求醫治腿上槍傷、經該院細結之下、據稱名胡</p>
<p>榮生、年二十四歲、山東人、家住法租界台拉司脫路、訊其因何受傷、則一味含糊、該院以形跡</p>
<p>可疑、乃卽報告捕房、派捕到院、將其帶入捕房、轉送巡捕醫院、將其腿傷處子彈箝出、檢騐之下、果係第三零零二號及第二四八零號兩華捕所發之槍彈、知係正在搜索之匪、乃急加以監視</p>
<p>逸匪又獲其一　詎未幾、捕房方面、又忽接法捕房電話、據稱金神父路廣慈醫院内有一槍傷男子、往該院求治傷在腹部、以言語支吾、已由該捕房扣留云、公共租界捕房得報、亟往將該男子提回、送往巡捕醫院醫治、經該院醫生檢騐之下、又發覺卽係被逸之匪、乃亦將其防視、訊其姓名、據稱名徐文卓、年二十二歲、家住法租界陶爾斐司路、並供認曾往行刦、開槍拒捕、當時同去者共有三匪云、因此捕房方面、對於被逃一匪、尚正在嚴緝中、至記者繕稿時止、據悉已獲有綫索、</p>
<h3>内河解凍輪船復航</h3>
<p>惟因天寒行駛較前略慢</p>
<p>吳淞江阻塞後改道行駛</p>
<p>行駛内河各輪船、自江浙各地大雪後、河道冰凍、交通爲之斷絶、益以蘇州河淤積日深、爲船隻阻塞、今各路輪船已完全恢復、惟無錫·靑浦·等處輪船、均改駛南黃浦、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>解凍復航　招商·寗紹·公茂·恊興·泰東·源通·瑞生祥·立興·等内河輪船公司行駛滬杭·滬湖·滬錫·滬蘇·滬張·滬靑等處輪船、前因江浙各地大雪、河道冰凍、以致靑浦·常熟·常州·無錫·等處輪船、有因之停航者、杭州·湖州·等處輪船開航、每次延遲、自經各輪船設法擊冰後、並以連日天晴、河道解凍、各處内河輪船、已完全恢復矣、惟因天氣寒冷、行駛較往日略慢、</p>
<p>轉道行駛　至於吳淞江因淤積日深、値此廢曆年關將屆之際、各鄉村船隻、駛滬辦</p>
<p>貨或售貨、甚爲擁擠、舢板廠橋等處船隻爲之擁塞、行駛滬錫滬靑之輪船、每次開船、均改駛南黃浦、惟路程較原有航綫約有一百餘里、故必須遲到、班期爲之脫落、聞同業公會已呈請設法疏濬、以利交通</p>
<h3>統稅局八萬餘舞弊案呈報財部發覺經過</h3>
<p>科員鄧大榮自述騙欵之原委</p>
<p>局長汪宗洙並自請失察處分</p>
<p>大公社云、本市蘇浙皖區統稅局二等科員鄧大榮、冒刻局長圖章、私向中央銀行先後騙取稅欵、達八萬餘元之鉅、始於去年年終結算時發覺、業由局方將鄧拘送地方法院訊辦、詳情曾紀前報、該局局長汪宗洙氏、以事關重大、昨特將經過詳情、</p>
<p>呈報財部　曁稅務署請求鑒核、兹經覓得該項原文如下、（上略）竊查本局所屬各查騐所征解稅欵、從前或以現金匯局、或交由銀行劃匯到局核收、統由局存放交通銀行保管彚解、自二十年四月間、奉前統稅署令行規定中央銀行經理征解統稅辦法施行後、或其他委托商號、</p>
<p>劃匯到滬　總行、每月具文虛解呈局列收、惟其時中央銀行、祇有統稅置帳户、向無本局帳户、至同年八月、接奉署令、以中央銀行業務局通知、收到查騐所解來稅欵係屬本局收入部份、各所雖係依照規定辦法、直接匯交中央銀行業務轉帳、但按主管系統、仍應由局</p>
<p>查照入帳　　補文虛解、以便撥正等因、當卽由局呈奉前統稅署、函准中央銀行業務局、援照魯豫區統稅局辦法、另開本局户帳、凡屬局轄各所匯來稅欵、應先列收本局帳内、由局塡發支票轉帳解署、遂於同年九月二十三日、簽署印鑑兩份、函送中央銀行業務局備查、此爲本局稅欵在中央銀行設立帳户之起始、查奉定頒行中央銀行經理收解財政部統稅署欵項辦法、</p>
<p>第十條稱　統稅署支欵印鑑由統稅署及各地統稅局所或查騐所、各自簽發、所有支票、亦各自保管、又各局所支票、祇限於每月二十五日匯解欵項時簽用、此外未經規定不得簽支等語、故本局每月彚解此項稅欵時、基所具支票、在票面「憑票祈交」下、書明「稅務署」字樣、並將票「或持票人」四字劃去、表示該支票之所解金額、專爲劃解稅務署賬户之用、至支票則由局長</p>
<p>親自署名</p>
<p>蓋用「宗洙」兩字象牙圖章、此牙章專爲簽支解欵之用、兹查有本局第一課審計股課員鄧大榮、向係辦理起解各項稅欵、曁審核各分機關解欵事務、歷經支配規定有案、以故各查騐所呈局解欵數目、與中央銀行列收本局賬户數目、均由該員審計、月終本局備文彚欵解署時、亦由出納員將支票送交該員查數塡列、交回送簽解署、而該員平日甚少請假、惟於新年假前、曾請病假數日、至月之四日、仍未銷假、是日適有南京查騐所呈解十二月份麥粉稅欵、因該員在假、解文及附件、遂由出納員點收、該出納員以所解係十二月份麥粉稅欵、向查核簿記所載、南京查騐所所征麥粉稅、僅據解至十月份、至其十一月份稅欵、何以中央銀行尚未列收、當由該出納員面陳前來、卽飭赴行查對、始知十一月份稅欵、銀行業已列收、而本局簿記未列此數、顯有弊混又詢悉中行曾有人迭次提支現金、並由中行將提支現金支票交閱、圖章簽字、</p>
<p>均不相符</p>
<p>定係有人僞冒提支、翻閱該支票後面、蓋有端記圖章、並有上海中國墾業銀行代收印據、並查得該鄧大榮、曾有以端記名義簽發墾業銀任支票、爲局中職員所見、是冒簽顯係該員所爲、嗣偵知該員於請假期内、潛赴廣東、並悉本月六日、乘亞州皇后船返滬、乃密派人守候帶訊、旋將該員褫職、送交上海市公安局看管、一面報由稅務署派委稽核陳濬·呂春明·兩員到局、會同開視該員所用公事鐵櫃、曁該員住宅抽屜、見有僞冒石質圖章一枚、及中央銀行支票簿、存根送金簿等件、又壓擱未掛號杭州查騐所解欵文三件、常州查</p>
<p>騐所解欵文二件、南京查騐夾解欵文一件、共計六件、又隠匿中行業務局收支通知書一帙、悉行查獲、至本局在中央銀行、</p>
<p>所立帪户</p>
<p>照章只能由局塡發支票、轉</p>
<p>帳解署、不能提取現金、又收</p>
<p>欵亦只有由各地查騐所匯劃到局、並無現金存入、該員職守、亦只在審核數目、乃在該員鐵櫃及抽屜、竟搜出僞印章、支票存根、及送金簿等件、當詰以印章支票何來、何以能向中央銀行提收現欵、又何從送交現金、據稱、「該員於　十一年四月間、因一時急用、擬向中行竊提稅欵、當預先私刋局長圖章一顆、於解欵塡寫支票時、將支票簿之領取支票單竊取、向中行騙得支票一本、當塡寫兩張、蓋用私刋圖章、向中行提取現金、中行初以</p>
<p>印鑑不符</p>
<p>拒不支付、職乃另簽兩張、仍蓋用私刋圖章、一面冒用局長名義、函致中行、請其照付、該函亦係蓋用私刋圖章、中行遂予照付、從此職遂獲得本局户口中行支票一本、於是繼續蓋用私刋圖章、陸續向中行騙取現金、嗣恐六月中年終、本局與中行核算數目時發覺、故有從中設法彌縫、因本局解欵、奉令須彚齊全月辦理、而各查騐所遠近不一、全數彚齊之時、往往將及一個月、其時近滬各查騐所下月稅欵、亦可解到、遂將近滬各所解欵公文、延不送交出納員、因此出納日計表、無從將此列入、簿記股亦</p>
<p>無從登帳</p>
<p>如是欵雖到行、文已到局、而本局出納·簿記·會計·各股、仍無從知悉、遂得移後抵前、如値六月及年終（卽半年度）核對帳目之時、數目如有參差、則再冒支若干、或送還中行現金若干、務令半年結帳、中行存欵、與本局帳列數相符、本局各股、無從發覺而止、至支過數若干、因爲日已久、無從記憶、自知死罪、但求寬辦等語、查核所述情形、設計之工、彌縫之巧、竟出常人意料之外局長以中行此帳户、照章只能轉帳解署、不能提取</p>
<p>現金、萬不料該員竟敢僞章騙取、</p>
<p>眞堪痛恨</p>
<p>至支過數目、當經商請中行、將本局帳目、自開户日起至二十二年底止、抄送前來、復與本局簿記大帳、詳加核對、計共騙取稅銀八萬四千三百四十八元二角八分、又由該員送還中央銀行二十七元○七分、實騙支八萬四千三百二十一元二角一分、查杭州查騐所二十二年十一月份征解麥粉稅欵一百五十四元七角、又杭查騐所同月征解棉紗稅欵一萬三千四百五十七元四角三分、又杭州查騐所同月征解火柴稅欵二萬五千五百元、又常州查騐所、同月征解麥粉稅欵三千二百十一元二角七分、又常州查騐所同月征解棉紗稅欵三萬一千七百七十一元二角二分、又南京查騐所、同月征解麥稅欵一萬○二百二十六元五角九分、合共八萬四千三百二十一元二角一分、</p>
<p>適符該員騙支中行存欵之數、此查詢該員僞冒印鑑、</p>
<p>騙取稅欵</p>
<p>之情形也、綜計該員先後僞冐騙提稅欵八萬四千三百二十一元二角一分、當拘送看管時、據交出上海鈔票二百十二元、香港鈔票七百五十元、又在上海中國墾業銀行、查有該員端記等户口存欵、計可截回一萬三千零零一元二角、尚欠七萬零三百五十八元零一分、該員僞冐印鑑、騙提稅欵、供證確鑿、實屬愍不畏法、自應嚴行懲究、以昭儆戒、到局長用人不當、失於覺察、咎無可辭、並請　　嚴予議處</p>
<p>以上所述本案情形、先經局長繕摺呈請財政部長鑒核、當奉部長面諭、飭將該員移送法院訊追究辦、遵於本月十五日函致上海市公安局、請將該員解送上海第一特區地方法院訊辦在案、除派員携同各種證據、代表赴第一特區地方法院自訴、並附帶民訴、及俟起訴後、再將法院訊追情形、隨時呈報外、理合將本局課員鄧大榮僞冐印鑑、向銀行騙支稅欵、及遵諭移送法院訊追經過各情、具文呈請鑒核、除呈財政部長外、謹呈財政部稅務署云、</p>

<h3>公共租界商團司令年度報告</h3>
<p>一九三三年係平靜無事年度</p>
<p>商團司令部房屋已着手改造</p>
<p>最近交卸之公共租界萬國商團司令湯穆士上校、送致工部局上年度之工作報告云、是年三月間、商轉各隊、均經英國駐滬軍司令佛禮明少將詳細檢閱、據其檢閱報告、謂本團堪與常備軍同任防衛租界、及恊助警察</p>
<p>維持治安</p>
<p>之責、一九三三年係属平靜無事之年度、故商團迄未被命動員團員對檢閱訓練、頗爲勤敏、效率日見增進、惟關於分隊調撥等練習、尚有進展之必需、至於使用之槍械、則自動槍之數、日益加多、團員於此項練習、未嘗懈弛、惟是員額不足、率較定制相去頗遠、此與租界之保衛、極關重要、乙級之預備隊隊員、原係爲招致曾服軍役者加入、但組成兩隊之後、應募者之數、</p>
<p>極爲失望</p>
<p>此則不可不亟予注意者也、商團司令部房屋已着手改造、每隊今後均有送達室一間、以便於連絡如此不獨動員之時、卽在平日、亦復便利許多、又靶子塲久需管理員一員、今已增派、於團員訓練、裨益殊多、俄員隊經派定指揮官之後、成績彰著如昔、該項隊員、多已改募靑年、與舊隊員不相上下、且頗注意運動、隊員尤見健康、堪稱滿意、湯穆士上校對於董事會之提携、及工部局各處之</p>
<p>合作精神</p>
<p>深表謝意、而於團員之服務及犧性精神、尤引以爲榮云、關於團員員額一層、查商團中之華員隊計定制爲官</p>
<p>長五員、團員一百二十名、現有之數、計官長七員、團員連現役及甲級預備員共一百六十四名、已超過定額云、</p>

<p>讀書問題</p>
<h3>怎樣訓練我們的頭腦（二）</h3>
<p>答許樂眞君（續）</p>
<p>總之：我們對於一個人求知的態度，應該是：</p>
<p>（一）爲生活的實用，以需要爲出發點，極力否認「爲學問而學問」的態度；</p>
<p>（二）從生活中去學習生活，讀書不過是一種手段；從生活中去養成自己的頭腦的組織力，不是專靠某一種理智。</p>
<p>（三）不是先造成一個完人方去認識社會，是在社會生活奮鬥中，漸漸擴張認識的界限；認識現實環境是我們極迫切的需要；但我們並不</p>
<p>能以冷眼觀之，遂爲滿足，認識以後怎樣呢？我們還要做點什麽呀！</p>
<p>以上是我們對於你的態度一點淺薄的貢獻，是否正確，還希望你與一般讀者諸君，加以指正。以下進而答覆你所詢問的幾項：　　（一）能訓練一個人的頭腦嚴密，健全，靈敏的作用的科學，我想，最適當的答覆是暹輯，但其他如數學，自然科學亦有這種作用。</p>
<p>（二）邏輯不僅「可以整理我們的思想」，並且可以糾正常識的錯覺。一個不懂暹輯的人一生常苦陷於矛盾的思維中，不能正確的認識一切現象，他常常誤將碎片視作整體，現出「拜物敎」之愚昧的無知，他還洋洋自喜，以爲把握了眞理。所以有人稱暹輯是方法論的科學。它提示了「認識」的正確方法。</p>
<p>研究暹輯並不一定要有高深的數學，却不能與「現實」分離，要在日常生活中去把握，一個没有進過學校的人，也能有很合邏輯的頭腦，可見生活中就有一定的邏輯，它已暗示一切忠於生活的人們了。這門科學，在書本上只能獲得一些法則；並且是怪難懂的，但一個飽嘗人生經歷的入，自然一讀卽懂。</p>
<p>（三）我們應學習唯物辯證法。但也不可不看形式邏輯的書。</p>
<p>（四）讀外國文的目的，是一種求知的手段或與職業上的需要。你旣已自修到可以讀外國名著的能力了，不必因研究其他科學而放棄英文。你最好在進行某一種研究時，同時看些與那</p>
<p>一門有關的英文著作。</p>
<p>最後，還希望你能提出一個更實際的，有系統的個人讀書計劃來討論。</p>

<p>弱點就是一個人的短處，不論是向來的習性或所做的事情，只要你一顯著了，自己未嘗不想彌縫掩蓋，而被那些聰明發現了，却和出戲法的人一般，一套一套利用起來，竟可以取之無盡，用之不竭，小而言之，便是個人生財之道，假使應用於國際，更是侵略的唯一法寳哩！怎麽說是個人生財之道呢？不說别的吧，卽以上海而論，聽說有許多假充木老（包打聽的别名）的人，身軀壯健，言語響亮，賣相是再吃香没有了，（吃香就是好）他們手下還有許多跑腿的人，供他奔走，供他探聽，祇要逢到雅片，賭博，紅丸，條子，（女人）等等犯法違禁的事情，他們就千方百計的跑進那地方，其勢洶洶的先給你一派恐嚇，你如其買他的帳了，（自然不能不買帳）他馬上就轉口風，說都是自家人，没有關係，没有關係，於是天大的事情，一會兒就變爲無事，可是五元十元的大洋票，已裝進他們的大衣袋了。</p>
<p>再看文化藝術方面，那些雜誌小說圖書和戲劇電影等等，又那個不是在使用這套戱法，他們所利用的，不外乎最顯著最普遍的性慾和迷信兩點罷了，只要留心每天日報上的廣告，就可以證明，試看舞臺上所排演的戲劇，大半是迷信神權，極力維護那所謂因果報應，銀幕的影片，更是標着有腿皆香無星不裸，富有誘惑力的大廣告，外加十六歲以上兒童禁止售票，以吸引一般色情狂的觀衆，小說圖書也都是描繪男女兩性的事情，連得日報的社會新聞，只要一涉及男女私情，就有聲有色的極力加以煊染，於是他們的出版物，一天天銷數增加。至於團際間的利用，更不用遠求，只要看把親善做口頭禪的惡鄰，起先利用淸政府的糊塗，甲午那年就割去了朝鮮台灣，到民國利用袁老頭的想做皇帝，就簽訂了二十一條。又利用新舊軍閥的奪利爭權，就供給械彈金錢，助長内戰，利用各個擊破的戰略，就很容易的，得了東四省，還利用……利用……過去的說不了，未來的不可說，唉！不知是我們的弱點太多呢？還不知是人家的善於利用？須得請問聰明的讀者。</p>
<h3>姚子讓軼事</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>姚子讓，已歸道山，滬人士悼之，其生前負一時之淸望，無竢縷縷，余特摭拾一二軼事，或爲人所未知者，略述如次。</p>
<p>海上書院之設，首推龍門，而當淸光緒十三年間，格致書院。由唐景星觀察，偕丹文律師，及傅蘭雅西士，延聘天南遯叟（王韜）爲監院，每年分四季爲課題，請於當道出題課士，許其優劣以定甲乙，列前茅者，例撥院欵，給以奬勵，而當道者，亦復分厥廉泉，優加策勉，藉以鼓舞興趣之焉。故格致與龍門對寺。時龍門重經古，格致尚時務。故列龍門者爲舊派，列格致者爲新派，新派</p>
<p>則『王佐才』，『鍾天緯』，『殷之輅』，『許克勸』輩，常列超等；而舊派則李鍾珏（平書）與姚子讓兩人，時露頭角，占龍門最高之聲價焉。</p>
<p>某歲督學使者，臨松屬，觀風題爲『江防海防策』姚與李競，姚『以防外爲控禦列强爲要策，而尤以自强爲本務，終則以天子有道，守在四夷』，爲鵠的。李則以『東南海口爲重，而尤以吳淞爲要』，其最精之語，有『使敵得以活砲攻獃堞，而吾反以獃砲擊活船』。姚李策文，皆爲宗師所激賞，而刋入江左校士錄中，姚之兄子梁，（名文棟）與子讓性稍殊，拘執且尤過之，而嘗與天南遯叟通書札，弟或誚之，而兄反斥其迂。子讓之子孟笹，不幸在哈埠死於非命，得耗，人皆哀之，獨其父曰：『是殆數耳，吾早知其此，非佳兆也，乃不之聽，卒以至斯，又將奚咎』？一若前知也者。滬上士風，至近歲稍稍替已，甚或以學閥貽譏，而子讓則以浮沉上下之際，而猶能引揚淸激濁爲己責，求之將來，春申滬瀆間，恐無此中心人物矣。噫！</p>
<h3>影戲院看客須知</h3>
<p>— 胡旭光</p>
<p>（一）進來得愈遲愈好，影戲院看客，十九喜歡站起來讓你在身傍挨擦過去的，踏踏他們的脚指，他們尤爲歡迎。</p>
<p>（二）來坐前，先立着脫大衣，鄰座老先生的眼鏡，前排大姑娘的帽子，不幸擋住你大衣的路綫時，那是眼鏡帽子自不識相，要走到地板上去，與你無干，脫大衣時，不妨多立一會，背後的人是專誠來賞鑒你的背影的。</p>
<p>（三）找錯了位子，向老太婆身上一坐，也是黑暗中應有的情事，誰敎那老太婆照着號數坐的。</p>
<p>（四）說明書須朗讀，你若帶了女友同來，應將片中情節和對白，淸淸晰晰，敎書般的講給伊聽，受益者决不止你女友</p>
<p>一人。</p>
<p>（五）片中主角歌唱時，你當拍着節奏，提高嗓子和他，看客出了錢，一小半固</p>
<p>然是來着戲，大半還是來聽你唱的。</p>
<p>（六）預料戲中情節，拖着鄰座的人，時財講給他們聽，影戲院顧客，十九是蠢漢，傍着你坐的人，尤其是愚不可及也，他們出了幾個錢，聽戲外又得啓發愚蒙，他們感激之心，當然無窮無盡。</p>
<p>（七）戲貴實在，貴有穿揷，你應當跟着戲中情節，多咳幾聲嗽，多吐幾口痰，以昭實在，瓜子花生殼香蕉皮，也是應有的穿揷品。</p>
<p>虹廟裏，香烟煇煌。醉心國粹的我，老大安心。</p>
<p>跑馬廳前，覺得的冷落。華安等大厦，像黑色的絞架般，矗立在暗影中。夜風裏，近邊街樹，伸出鐵枒枝，扣着銀絃月，自然歌唱。</p>
<p>凱司令的門半開着，流出熱的「爵士」，eupetic　rhythm一不自主的跨了進去。肚裏早已飽飽的，吃杯「佳妃」吧。對座有個摩登女郎，嘴裏說說着沙蟹，伊自己是老蟹。艶艶的白狐領，遮不住鬢邊的皺紋。</p>
<p>「夢魂慣得無拘束，又踏楊花過謝橋」……曼長的後影，伴我歸途中。</p>
<h3>前夜</h3>
<p>— 蔡德秩</p>
<p>霓紅燈光，鑲上鉛灰的天，眞像昏黝的古銅鏡，一抺暈紅，一霎凄</p>
<p>麗。</p>
<p>整天到晚，大考關夜學，難得是禮拜六晚上。寫字間才下來，輕輕的鍍進樂鄉飯店，吃了頓安逸夜飯。出得門外，心裏眞開心，菜味不壞呀。</p>
<p>經過Ｐalaoe　Hotel，臨街的玻璃窗裏，紳士淑媛，閒雅地還在啜茗另緻的燈光，古典的牆飾音樂台上的琴師，正在奏曲。藝術派的頭髮，一副小生面孔。</p>
<p>航空劵藍底白字的廣告，像大减價的旗招，到處飄揚。勸戒國難中民衆抑制徼倖心的怪物羅斯福，該先到南京路上露露臉，好下回别再出醜。</p>
<p>陳玉梅的催眠歌，早已唱遍南京路上，却仍熱閙。行人眞多，女人也眞多。一不留心，撞在人身上。『怎不生眼睛的？』只怪自己看得出神，找着一頓外快排頭。</p>
<p>假使大世界畔，僅有些白坯粗料，這裏才是精製品。鰻樣身兒，毒鱗般燦爛裝扮。迷人的鵝黃，匀開在克萊拉寳式的粉　上。德歌派拉的寳貝小姐，一百四十萬西洋化裝品的消耗者！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十三回　創痛難堪凝神鼓樂勸情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>伙計也不答復，望望他就笑了。接着道：二爺不出一個分子嗎？積之道：他們不下我的帖子，我怎樣的送禮呢？說着，扭轉身，自向家中書房裏走。他的書籍，都搬到大紅門鄉村學校裏去了，這是哥哥的書房，順手在書架子上抽下一本書來，就坐到寫字桌邊來看。一展書面，却是一本阿</p>
<p>彌陀經。心裏想着，天下事，就是這樣矛盾。哥哥是一個最</p>
<p>熱衷的人，他書架子上，偏有這種佛書。於是隨手展開書來，只看那第一行，「如是我聞：一時，佛在舍衛國，祇樹給</p>
<p>孤獨園一。看了之後，大意雖可以猜到，但是不能十分了解。手裏按着書，微昻着頭想了一想，轉念，管他懂不懂，我只拿來解解悶。好在這經文後面有解釋，可以耐心看了下去</p>
<p>，定定性，不然，今天我會發狂的，於是把解釋反看淸楚明白了，又跟着向下看了幾行。正覺勉强可以看懂一點，接着是一大串梵語音譯的人名字，乃是長老舍利弗，摩訶目鍵連，摩訶迦棄，摩訶稱延……看有兩行還是這個，不但不知所云，而且還有些頭暈眼花。正呆定着呢，一陣嗚嘟嗆咚的音樂聲，送入耳鼓。心想，這是花馬車去接新人去了呢。我不要聽這種聲音，到後院裏玩玩去罷。這時，他兄長厚之，病體已好了八九成，將一張籐椅，放在後院太陽裏，躺在籐椅上，捧了一本雜誌看，嫂嫂也在旁邊一張小椅子上結毛繩衣。積之緩緩走了來，向厚之道：你病剛好一點，就不用看書了。厚之道：你來了正好，過了今天，明天你還是回學校敎書去罷。我已經好了，也就用不着你在家裏看護我了。</p>
<p>（二三○）</p>
<p>逰蹤</p>
<h3>寒魂獨弔</h3>
<p>— 楓子</p>
<p>策杖獨行，不是帶着十分的意興去鑒賞久别後的西子風色，但，偶見堤上落葉，山脚枯林，一片滿目寒凉的冬意襲上我的心頭時，一顆凄凉的心會體認到生命的眞義。許是平時和兩三朋友們擡手浪邀時，没有這樣的心境吧！酒，女人，無聊的閒話，會賜予我們無邊的歡樂。漫說如此的荒凉之冬的陰午，三春的花香鳥語，也會讓迷人的嬌聲和眩目的小腿先佔了詩人的靈府。大自然本不要無聊的游人去擾亂它的詩境，寂寞是萬物的歸至，有寂寞乏心的人，蹌蹌在寂寞之境的自然中，不聞喧囂的寂寞中，一切的靜物都在默語了。死水樣的心也會泛起生命的泉流。</p>
<p>灰氷似的凍雲，死樣地躺着不動，悶在家，愁對一爐紅炭。無限的煩愁，被火焰薰得透不過氣來。「外邊溜溜吧！」</p>
<p>「何處去？孤山的寒梅想已報到春訊吧！」提着手杖，已决定了去處。</p>
<p>熱閙的街市，騷動着生倫的跳動。雖在寒冬。街東眼紅着汽車的威武，伏在巷裏做白日夢。讓這老者吃頓點心吧！一次的講價，就答允了他的要求。蝸牛樣的姿勢，悔不該呌他拉，自私和慈善的矛盾意識，又在衝動了。</p>
<p>冷落的湖濱，飛着蕭疎的黃葉。白水灰山，西子是减去了從前的妍麗了。</p>
<p>在冬天，陰霾欲雪的冬午，白堤獨行，每念竹笠芒鞋的詩僧曼殊的身世，感喟如身受。呵！曼殊一生是秋冬。</p>
<p>長堤無人，慢步狂吟，衰柳中透過幾陣寒風，冷得令人寒噤。這是寂寞中的禮物，不出門，不會和你會面。</p>
<p>從柳枝夾道的孤山路可以聽到對岸的汽笛狂吼，這是大禮堂電影院的接客車。白日在黑暗析電影院裏娛樂，是文明人的適當消遣。</p>
<p>「欲問梅消息，豈待鹤歸來！」自林和靖辭了人世，他的愛妻寵子也不願處此鏖俗了。也好，生死的知音已去，何必獨留着受無謂的摧折。寒芳三百，早隨飛鹤而俱逝，剩有貪人世的幾株，也敗萎得枝殘花稀了。</p>
<p>淺翠，幽紅，藹密，倩疎，昔日的倩妝，遺留的夢影，依稀還在一片寒雲裏，憧憬已往的歡情。</p>
<p>沉靜裏，寒冷裏，彷彿聽到參天的古樹，沙沙的在對人表示一些同情，炎凉的人世，許是没有這樣的同情吧！</p>
<p>「孤山的梅花不像樣了，靈峯好得多呢，那邊人也多！」</p>
<p>耳邊浮着幾句感嘆的聲音，在嘈雜的汽車歸途中。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>續談「海派」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>沈從文先生替「海派」下定義，說是「名士才情與商業競賣相結合，便成立了吾人今日對於海派這個名詞的槪念。」徐懋庸先生提出異議，以爲「文壇上倘眞有「海派」與「京派」之别，那末我以爲商業競賣是前者的特徴，名士才情却是後者的特徴。」我因想起魯迅先生講演上海文藝之一瞥的一段話，當上海夷塲初闢時，從四處來了一些多愁多病的才子，他們把張</p>
<p>園當作大觀園，把那些婊子當作十二金釵；自以爲「惟才子能憐這些風塵淪落的佳人，惟佳人能識坎軻不遇的才子」，於是成了神仙眷屬。不幸他們後來「發見了佳人並非因爲愛才若渴而做婊子的，佳人祗爲的是錢。佳人要才子的錢是不應該的，於是想了種種制伏婊子的妙法，不但不上當，還佔了她們的便宜。」所以海派的初型是才子十（加）獃子，後來進步了，成爲才子十流氓。</p>
<p>在東新橋有一家商店的窗櫃裏，張着一幅畫，畫上題着「八洞神仙打麻將」的名句：這當然還該有幅「八洞神仙打野鷄」的名畫纔十全十美，但我們已够滿意了，她銓釋「海派」的涵義，比千言萬語還要顯豁些。八洞神仙是那麽淸高，淸高到不食人間烟火的；一到了夷塲，就不能不「摩登化」，過「打打麻將」的生活；我們凡人更不必說了。現在偷鷄橋畔巍然的湖社，她的前身就是有名的壽聖庵；據查密室之中，除了各種化裝品以外，還有白濁粉之類。西門有一家妻妾盈堂的巨宅，其家主便是某山的某方丈。一九三三年的打𫒽，在大世界起法塲的，正是從龍虎山下野的張大天師。上海這夷塲自有其偉大之處，任何法力廣大的妖精，不論穿的是怎樣一種外衣，道袍也好，袈裟也好，長袍馬褂也好，在這一面大鏡子裏終究顯了原形，身後都拖着一條長長的尾巴。</p>
<p>文學家，藝術家，雖說也是千年修鍊的狐狸精，在外衣上都繡着「道德」，「淸高」，「精神生活」這一類美麗的花紋；然而在照奴鏡裏依然顯出原形。這在京派看來，當然有些刺眼的，那麽長長的尾巴拖在外衣之外；可是有什麽法子呢？這裏就來了「京派」和「海派」的分野：知道不能掩飾了，索性把尾巴拖出來，這是「海派」；扭扭揑揑，還想把外衣加長，把尾巴蓋住，這是「京派」。聖人曰：與其「京派」也寗「海」。時常要留心外衣的後擺，總是太勞神的。　海派的術語中，有所謂Ｘ式Ｙ式的，諸如一九三四式的汽車，一九三四式的旗袍，在商業競賣中，就呌做「行情」。不幸一九三三式的海派文人，已從商業競賣的市塲中踢出；新書秤斤論價，究稿子的朋友幾乎連西北風也喝不飽；僅僅「商業競賣」的特徴也一筆勾消了。這樣</p>
<p>看來，一九三四式的海派文人，「才子」十「流氓」還是不够的，應當另有一種加法；可惜我不懂數學，不知「歐幾里得」幾何學上的程式是怎樣擺的！</p>
<h3>走夷方</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>「男走夷方，女多居孀。生還發疫；死棄道旁。」</p>
<p>聽着暫時聚會的旅伴，拖起曼長的聲音，在唱鎭南州人唱的歌謡時，輕烟也似的憂鬱，便悄悄地繞在我的心上了。跟着他拐下山坡的那一陣，簡直是缺乏了走路人應有的力氣。</p>
<p>坡脚下，正躺着濕霧凄迷的狹長的原</p>
<p>野，延展到灰暗的天盡頭，這就是我要走去的夷方呵，蠻烟瘴雨的夷方呵。</p>
<p>高山，黑鬱鬱的高山，頭上包着帕子也似的白霧，綿互在原野的兩側，現出蠻狠兇惡的樣子。山頂上，那些白茫茫的霧裏，就正躱藏着野人之家。他們的生活，據說便是下山來搶掠原野中的擺夷，和過路的旅客的。</p>
<p>那時大約淸明已過了，漢人地方還是和煦的春天，可在這兒呢（雲南人呼爲夷方壩，元史則書爲干崖）已像夏季似的，到處都悶着熱：霧的熱，雨的熱，濕氣的熱。</p>
<p>我的旅伴（一個中年人）說，在淸明以前直至去年的九月，這個期間，這裏是不缺少晴天的，每天都有好太陽，雨嗎，一滴也瞧不見。現在麽，可就倒楣了，每天總得淋幾塲雨的。這裏的雨，不像漢人地方的雨哪，又毒又可怕（很容易生病）的。還有那瘴氣呵，瘴氣！菩薩保佑！他說到這裏，他的週身像突遭襲擊一般，簡直顫慄起來。隨卽好意地責備我，說是年靑人怎不在臘月間出來，現在來送死麽？</p>
<p>我一面聽着他的話，一面看見了路上的擺夷婦女，多是眉淸目秀的，而且有的農家姑娘，竟比漢族女子返要美麗些，便說道，這裏人，不是活得很好麽？　　這是夷人呀，他大聲地駁斥我；隨卽舉出許多漢人在這裏中了瘴毒的可怕情形來。我無話可說了，祇有用一句話來抵他，卽是說，那末，你現在又來夷方做什麽呢？</p>
<p>天哪，這是爲了要吃飯，爲了要養家哪，他愁苦地呻吟着。我因要在言語上戰勝他，就微笑地答道：我不是也同你一樣的嗎？其實，那時我没有家，也不</p>
<p>祗是爲了一己的生活；多半的原因，是由於討厭現實的環境，才像吉卜色人似的，到處漂泊去。然而，爲了要看看新奇的景物，便來到這麽令人喪氣的地方</p>
<p>，自然心裏也不免有些憂鬱了。</p>
<p>那末，你也做我一樣的生意嗎？他閃着狡猾的眼睛。</p>
<p>什魔？你做什麽生意？…！我倒問他起來。</p>
<p>呃呃……他不答覆了，祗是哼着他的鎭南州人的歌謡。</p>
<p>後來走到八募原野，經緬甸的便衣巡警搜查時，才曉得他，我的老好的旅伴，是私販鴉片烟的。倘如早知道，我便要裝成他那麽一付老成的面容，學他責備我一樣，來貢獻我的忠告的。但他却由那一次，連同禁物帶到牢中去了，以後一直没有見面過。</p>
<h3>滬寗特别快黑嬰</h3>
<p>嗚…嗚…嗚…</p>
<p>汽笛子吼着。機關頭突起肚子往前衝，烏煤烟直冒起來，順着風拖到尾巴那兒去。</p>
<p>山，田野，樹林都往後退。</p>
<p>遠遠地望去，火車像長蛇。『格隆，…格隆…』響着節拍的輪子一直轉着没停：滬寗特别快！</p>
<p>頭等車廂中：</p>
<p>寬暢，淸潔，舒適……</p>
<p>啣着高價的雪茄，站在玻璃邊望車外的景緻；在這位「貴人」的心裏：　　『冬天了呢，美麗的田野都枯黃了』。他的女兒把一本小說丢開去，鬆了鬆氣。她瞧瞧爸爸，好一會才開口說：</p>
<p>『爸，到了上海我是不回去的了』！『什麽話？你打算在上海幹什麽』？</p>
<p>『讀書呀』。</p>
<p>『南京可以讀的。爲什麽』：</p>
<p>『上海不是更好麽？…唉，慢慢說吧。爸，我肚皮有點餓呢，呌點什麽吃吃吧』！</p>
<p>說了，懶散地伸了伸腰，口裏又「呵」地一聲兒噴着氣。</p>
<p>於是，十五分鐘以後便給送來許多東西。</p>
<p>吃着的時候女兒笑迷迷地摸了摸一貴人」的臉。</p>
<p>二等車廂中：</p>
<p>龍井茶，瓜子，小報……</p>
<p>一個科長半躺在位子上看小報。是中年人，留起了小鬍子。坐在他對面的一個女人和她的丈夫都很疲倦的樣子，閉起眼打盹。科長的眼珠子從報紙上面溜過來。溜到女人的粉臉上停了分把兩分鐘。突然汽笛子又吼起來，女人睜開眼，科長忙又看報去了。</p>
<p>女人喝了口龍井。</p>
<p>那丈夫還猪那麽地睡着。她對這稍稍覺得胖的丈夫漠不關心瞧了一眼，摇遥腦袋。</p>
<p>科長換另一張報的時候，心裏想：『還不差，這女人可以要得！可是』…就摸摸唇上的鬍髭。</p>
<p>三等車廂中；</p>
<p>長衫，瓜皮帽，嘈雜的聲音……</p>
<p>江北女人在這麽冷的天氣裏裸出奶頭喂她的孩子。她的臉子上，籠罩着一層陰暗……</p>
<p>忽然孩子捨了奶頭哭起來，哭得很大聲，坐在不遠的一個戴瓜皮帽的人便咕嚕着；</p>
<p>「媽的！哭什麽？媽的…」</p>
<p>但是孩子那裏懂得人們的討厭呢？依然大聲地哭着，哭着。</p>
<p>嘈雜着，喧閙着，…</p>
<p>婦人，孩子，男子，…</p>
<p>查票的在這裏走過去，後邊跟着武裝兵士。一個老年人看見他們走過了，便對他的媳婦說起話來；</p>

<h3>評「妬誤」（續）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>那劇情的簡單，特别是那側重妬嫉心理的題材，很容易使我們想這劇會冗長散漫以及乏味，但培爾納，不愧爲近代戲劇的祖國之子，他寫得很好，藉着極適當簡潔的對話，使全劇始終緊凑地發展着直到收尾，不因爲那過份的心理的表現，而使人物麻痺，不因爲具體的事實的稀少，而使對話陷於鬆或厭倦。雖然露面的就只四個人物，而他按排得很好，没有一次不必要的出頭，也很少不必要的說話。</p>
<p>但若從思想方面考察，道作者是犯着意識朦朧的毛病，他把事件設在世界大戰的背景之上，人物又受了大戰的沈重的破壞的影響，而他却把那位丈夫的妬嫉的心理放在一般化的情形之下作着深刻的解釋，雖然在這對不幸的夫婦的話語中也偶而流露出是戰爭毁壞了這個靑年男子，而且使他們的生活遭到破滅的不幸，而作者確實並未曾說明大戰後一般人因爲希望的幻滅，對於生活的厭倦，才有這種病態的疑忌的心理，這事實，可以由勃朗施的想念和話語來證明，她說；「他那個國家在吸引我。這好似一張門突然開了，從這張門中我瞧見一條我早在尋覓的道路……也許是幸福吧。」大戰後德奥法諸國是被毁壞了，只有美國却還能保持着一個新奥的資本主義的國家，歐洲人看看自身周圍戰後的慘景，不能不對於那正在繁榮的美洲有所憧憬，勃朗施的這種講話不過是代表了歐洲人的一般的意見而已，然而在這劇中，作者却說是因爲那丈夫的不合理的妬嫉，才使她感到幻滅，感到日常生活的無情，以致忍着痛苦要抛却她那麽心愛的人，跑向一個陌生的國土裏去。</p>
<p>爲了使那位丈夫的妬嫉成爲破壞他們幸福生活的强有力的理由，作者感到非常的困難，而特别因爲這是在劇的文學中，這困難顯示得異常的淸楚，他不憚煩地，周密地，使用着法國自然主義的方法，作出妬嫉心理的解剖，以彌補事件的發展，顯示出不自然的痕跡。但他究竟不能尋出特别適當的理由，仍只是那老套子的愛與妬的衝突的說明，大戰的影響不過是附屬的，他用安得烈的口講道：「我太愛你了，我以後要更加適當的愛你。我現在愛你愛得不得法。或者我已經不知道愛你了。由達姆斯塔營中回到你身邊的是一個蠻子，一個被苦痛磨壞了的人。」還有，「……一種險惡的疑心有時蓋住了我的理性。這正像一種不能抵抗的染在人身上的熱病。如果我愛你没有愛得這樣厲害時，也不會弄到這樣的。啊！原諒我吧！……」同時，爲使安得烈的妬嫉心得到相當的根據，作者更安排了一個揷話，那就是妻之女友貞勒的事。當安得烈在俘虜之中，他的一個同伴名呌韋班的死了，在他臨死的時候，他對着安得烈洩露了這個秘密｜｜韋班和貞勒的私戀。安得烈由於這件事給與他的驚異，其後他推論道：「這男子以爲他的女人純潔，我也以爲我的女人純潔。」「這男子從没離開過他的女人。我呢，我離家四年。」這樣，她像他的妬嫉心更是合理的了。</p>
<p>但是，無論作者怎樣想法彌補，怎樣想以妬嫉破壞生活的理由說服讀者，我們從他所叙述的事件中｜｜如果那是現實的忠實的描寫的話｜｜是能够看出另外的道理來，那破壞了他們的幸福的生活的一個强有力的理由。卽，他們生活的必然的没落，是大戰之所賜，是被他們的時代决定了的。譬如安得烈，在四年的俘虜之後回到家來，他的妻不給他一點可疑的地方，他們是不是會幸福地活下去呢？｜｜那也是不可能的了。（未完）</p>
<h3>父女（七）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>「對不起，小姐，我打攪了你。」</p>
<p>女客是那麽謙遜，那麽懂得禮貌，說話的聲音又是那麽動聽。她故意走了一兩步，望着懸在書室中的肖像，她知道她的眼睛没有一點錯。她的心在跳了，她向那婦人說：「您請坐吧，您可以先脫去外衣。」</p>
<p>她看到那女客脫下大衣，就走過去接到手中，掛到門背的衣架上去，那女客坐了，她自己就坐在對面的座位上。</p>
<p>女僕捧來了兩杯茶，分放在她們前面。</p>
<p>「您住在這城裏麽？」</p>
<p>「不，我是過路人，從前，｜呵，從前我也在這裏住過的。」</p>
<p>「您是特意到這城裏來玩的麽？」</p>
<p>「也不是，我是和我的丈夫……」</p>
<p>那女客說到這裏突然停了，像是有點什麽感覺抓住了她的心，就露出一點點的窘迫。她看到這情形，便讓着她喝點茶，看見她端起了茶林，她自己也翅茶杯送到嘴邊。「我們到Ｘ地去，經過這裏，也只有兩三天的勾留。」</p>
<p>女客說完了，就把眼睛落到壁上懸着的一方素絹上，那上面是繡着四句關於男女情愛的詩句。她記得在她很小的時候就看到那方古怪的裝飾。她從烟盒裏取出一支烟來，送給那女客「您抽烟吧。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你。」</p>
<p>因爲是那麽專情地注視着，爲她的話所驚擾，有一點失措地道着謝。她就劃了一根火柴，爲客人點着了那支烟。那女客像是很熟練又很巧妙地把那支烟夾在右手的食指和中指的中間，這可以使人看出她對於紙烟是一個嗜好者。</p>
<p>「您來看我的父親有什麽要緊的事麽？」</p>
<p>「没有什麽，不過來望望他罷了，他是我舊日的一個友人。」</p>
<p>「呵，是這樣的！｜｜」</p>
<p>她故意拖長了聲音。</p>
<p>「他近來好麽？」</p>
<p>「很好，什麽都好，｜｜」</p>

<p>上表中數字順序、係按各國數量排列、總數字係俄菲美英等國合計、至絲茶則菲洲占半數以上、美國次之、紅茶尚以英國占首位、英國次之、而磚茶一項則完全爲俄國所獨占者、至增减數字、已詳前表、惟紅茶中所增加者、大抵爲兩湖之低等茶、輸往俄國之其他茶、則有毛茶少許及</p>

<h3>粳食　期粉近跌遠漲</h3>
<p>期麥無大出入</p>
<p>粉昨日上午開市後、因前日廠户成交賒麥兩船後、市上人心已軟、而定麥又見一再抵埠、新定二船亦在月底可到、小廠成進洋麥</p>
<p>後、立卽在市套出、大廠觀望、但亦不趁小抵補、浮多散空鑒於廠方情形、亦多隨時回賣、惟浮多與散客一方回出近月、一方收回遠期、故遠期各月份疲後卽爲轉站、近月則抵補旣乏、多頭爭出、再有小廠套賣、市乃不能站住、本月份收市較小一分二五、二月三月各小二五、四月漲半分、五月大二五、六月大七五、</p>
<p>麥現貨到銷均無、存貨不多、喊價仍須四元一角至四元一角半、期麥因年底收束、雙方均無用神、故全日交易甚淡、市價亦無大出入、收市價祗本月小一分、其餘各月均少出入云</p>
<h3>客秈增價轉致滯銷</h3>
<p>昨日客秈貨主以客化較暢、到頭不多、乃喊高一角、閩帮因此少辦、只成交南京機秈米二百多包、本街囤户鄉莊均有問津、昨市成交湖南機油二百包、價七元一角、江西機晚一百包、價七元二角半、機元二十五包、價六元半、南京機米三百包、價六元二角八分至六元○九分、價與前市相似、</p>
<h3>晚稻到源頗旺</h3>
<p>｜厚粳銷滯價小近角｜</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帶來源共到八十餘號、計萬餘石、而其中晚稻竟占半數、幸包胃去路轉旺、故市况未見若何疲頽、迺如靑角松泗西練等貨、北洋天津唐沽帮及南洋厦門等帮與乎上棧者所納三千餘包、行情略修六分、各帮厚粳因到貨較旺、本街店胃轉懈、市况垂軟數分至近尺、杜洋尖則尚無過大上落、陰變元俱見轉定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到貨三十五六號、市上各貨去胃平常、市形白粳白元高貨定立、中次價小近角、羊杜埠尖亦帶軟勢、早薄稻及陰元客尖堅定、</p>
<h3>雜糧推花生挺拔</h3>
<p>舊歷年終關係</p>
<p>昨日雜糧現貨交易異常零落、統市成交各糧不滿三千包、黃豆計開出正陽關豆二車、頴州豆二車、蚌埠豆一車、價無上落、辦胃由内地及本街採去、其餘牛莊紅糧開五百包、價做三元零二分、開原苞米一百十包、價爲三元零五分、南京明菉豆一百五十包、價爲三元四角七、郯城生紅一百十包、價爲五元一角、雙溝花生三百包、價爲六元三角、市價除花生挺榮生仁萎疲外、餘均平定之勢、</p>
<h3>糖市赤白糖劃盤再漲</h3>
<p>潮靑開跌</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金標金均升、而荷匯微縮、趨勢更見緊俏、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃十九元七角、比前日升一角、轉口貨六元七角、比週二升角半、荷赤高陳貨劃十六元二角、升二角、新高貨呌十五元八角半、新下檔劃十五元四角半、太古昨市愈緊、又呌升三角、Ｂ嘜爲二十元三角、未成、振裕一號縮白又升一角、爲十八元九角、二三四號每檔逐退二角、昌興行續開正綿荷白三千餘包、仍爲十九元、後不肯再開、下盤看緊、潮靑上檔多而下檔缺、故市勢亦隨多少而異、昨開二百餘包、價爲十二元二角至十二元、下檔十一元四五角、比前跌二三角至一二角、海南赤許省記開出二百餘包、價爲十三元六角半、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>太平年</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>所請著名預言家寳納斯夫人，最近又憑她那洞照空明的先知的眼光，說一</p>
<p>九三四年將成爲「絶無任何戰事」的「太平年」。一切先知們對於世事的「談言微中」，本來是與得航空頭二三彩一樣的困難。然而對於寳納斯夫人所胡謅（無論其爲「如響斯應」或爲毫無靈騐，但任何先知們的說話，都絶不能脫離「胡謅」的範疇）的「太平年」一我却認爲除了咱們貴國根本要列於例外，在國際動向的推演中，是有幾分客觀之可能性的，理由如下：</p>
<p>第一，讀者諸君　大槪都着過至少一兩次「國劇」的。看過國劇的人一定不會忘記：每逢「金錢豹」，「安天會」，「長板坡」等「滿臺飛火」，「天兵天將」的「全武行」出塲之前，無臺上一定有兩三分鐘的寗靜，拉下幕布，敲着斷續的小鑼，由檢塲面的人拉開桌椅，掉挨戰景，勝出空間，以便那些武行們「好摔裸子」和「打出手」，這些手續完畢，然後纔把鑼鼓大擂大敲，等着大將和𠶭囉們急急風亮相而出，點將，會陣，開打……逐一加緊地表演下去。現在的國際舞臺，也是和我們貴國的國劇舞臺一樣，正是「全武行」上演以前，暫時靜下來檢塲面的時候。國際戰爭雖是絶不可免，但帝國主義列强們差不多都有所待。金元國一面要忙於從藍鷹運動中找回復景氣的路，一方面要等待一百零一艘大造艦計劃的完成。木屐國旣要從容消化滿洲，又要從軍事政治各方面完成其一九三六年以前的「非常時計劃」。其他英法意等國，都是要一面拼命備戰，一面盡外交上縱横闔之能事。除此以外，還要開各種聊盡人事的會議，還要倡導「</p>
<p>和平」。所以就各種的事實推演看來，說今年可以成爲「太平年」，是並非完全空想的。</p>
<p>第二，若要使「太平年」成爲「國貨」，恐怕就很少日可能。因爲同胞中之喜歡玩槍砲的人，在去年閩省的軍閥旣然大殺大砍，大閙其全武行，玩之惟恐不及，今年也似乎是興猶未闌，還待「仍須努力」。不觀夫孫殿英馬鴻逵之流手？現在都存了「滅此朝食」的决心在做「太平年」的反面工作。所以，除了少數又將</p>
<p>「放洋」（陳眞如李任潮恐怕在今年必要「放洋」了）的要人而外，大多數的阿斗之羣，多半不會有享受「太平年」的福氣呢。</p>
<p>第三，像預言這一些迷信的玩意兒，在咱們中國最爲風行，在洋大人的國度裏，却不多覩。但是寳納斯夫人最近所胡謅的太平年，却轟動各國，引起注意。這是啥格道理？因爲人類對於迷信的沉溺，遇到亂世必更加深刻。當天下滔滔，禍機四伏的時代，人生的遇合遭際，往往盡奇險變幻之極，絶難馮自己的意嚮加以捉摸和把握。如是許多在人事上碰壁，弄成「丈二和尚，摸不着頭腦」的人，都從主觀的苦悶之中，不自覺地從「天命」方面去找精神上的安慰。中國星相業之日益風行，和西方預言之引起廣汛的注意，都是這個原故。蓋被戰爭危機與經濟恐慌弄得頭昏腦脹的帝國主義者，也要從「人事」以外，想一想「天命」何如也。</p>
<p>「太平年」雖然就是「太戰年」的先遣隊，然而對戰爭深懷憂懼的世人，却都樂聞「太平年」的預言。然則寳納斯夫人，在這萬方多難的年頭，也不失爲一個麻醉一時的「福音便者」呀。</p>
<h3>烤火取暖的話</h3>
<p>— 禱</p>
<p>在天氣嚴寒的日子，人們免不了烤火取暖這一烤火取暖的行爲，大概是遠祖所傳，古已有之。可是時至現代，科學昌明，汽管水汀的取暖法已經打倒「如古法製」的烤火取暖法了，這在保存國粹的意義上雖然是嘆世風之不古，但在人類幸福的享受上却又是幸進步之迅速。關於汽管水汀取暖法，除了大都會的少數人才能够享受，這且不去說它。現在談談烤火取暖的話吧。</p>
<p>能够在家裏安設火爐烤火取暖的人，自然不及在家裏安設汽管水汀的富貴人家，可是「比上不足比下有餘」，火爐烤火畢竟比較安設火盆烤火的暖得多。能够在家裏安設火盆烤火取暖的人，自然不及在家裏安設火爐的人，可是亦可以　　　生不足比下有餘」，火盆　火　竟比較没有火盆在受凍的暖得多。這一種「比上不足比下有餘」的人生哲學，所謂「安分」與「守命」者也，理合「凛遵母違」。所以在下的，家裏安設了一個火盆，心滿意足，居處晏如。</p>
<p>可是在下的昨天晚上臨睡以前在床上貪看一本心愛的書，忘記將火盆的火掩熄，被炭氣的毒質襲擊之下，昏昏然睡去，一直到今天午飯時分還不會淸醒，被人人敲門大呌以後才有點如夢初覺，險些悶死在這窓户與房門俱閉的亭子間裏頭，｜這眞是八字還好，運氣未衰｜同時看了今天報紙載着某家娘姨在亭子間烤火取暖悶死的新聞，爲之冷汗直流。由於自己的險些悶死，和着報知道有人已經眞眞悶死了的刺激，使在下的一時利令智昏，妄想着　如人人都可以享受着汽管水　　　　　　　　　　　　自然是非分的念頭了，然而，其實這個念頭江不是非法。怎麽說不是非法的呢。科學的昌明，時代的推移的結果，自然是都市電氣化進步到農村也電氣化，已經電氣化的地方自然可以安設汽管水汀以取暖，不過這種都市與農村都電氣化的時代遠着遠着吧了。</p>
<p>然而今天報載「家庭電氣化之發展」一則似評論的新聞說，「電氣之於工廠，運輸，交通，人莫不嘆其用之廣，其效之宏也不然近世科學昌明，電氣之爲用，……故有家庭電氣化之實現，……今日建設是類家庭者，不啻千萬，而傳至他日，必益之而至千百萬，可斷言也。」那末這家庭電氣化「傳至他日，必益之至千百萬」的「可斷言也」的時代，是不大很遠的了。</p>
<h3>冬令補藥</h3>
<p>— 抱虛</p>
<p>一到了冬令，報紙上都有藥店裏的廣告登着，說冬令是吃補藥最好的時候，大家都應該吃點補藥，能使人袪病延年，補陽益壽。</p>
<p>當然，在這種年頭，國脈是一天一天地衰了下去，如能大家吃點補藥，大家能袪病延年補陽益壽，這對於我們民族的前途，不無間接的影響，不消說對於自己的身體可以非常强壯，並且我們生了子女下去，則將來的子女，爲了遺傳的關係，大家也自然，都像我們一樣的强壯。那我們雖被敵人所滅亡，而這「不共戴天」之仇，還怕我們自己的子女總有報復的一天？那時候，，我們等看着罷！恐怕那些隣邦，又都說「黃禍」來了啊！</p>
<p>所以中西的文化，其實並没有不同，德國的希特勒現在雖在提倡優生遺傳，而在我們中國，其實也在提倡着了。不過這方式有些差異，德國人是以「霸道」治天下，而我們中國人却以「王道」治天下，其分别僅僅在此！</p>
<p>是故補藥之出現於這樣的年頭，我們稍以邏輯的頭腦一想，誰曰不宜呢？　　我因此自己天天對着鏡子看看自己的臉，感到懂幾乎也一天黃了一天，一天瘦了一天，也頗有點想吃些補藥補補看，而幾個關心於我的朋友呢，一見面也部以此相勸，那些懂得西洋醫理的朋友說：「你須打幾針補血針，把身體弄好要緊！」那些懂得中國醫理的朋友說，「你須吃點參或茸，把身體弄好要緊」！而我自己呢，聽到他們的話之後，只有報之一笑。</p>
<p>自然，我都謝謝他們的盛意，不論他們勸我打補血針也好，吃參或茸也好，這方式雖然各異，而於補的道理，總是一樣的吧？</p>
<p>不過際此冬令，如我一樣的人，或比我還不如的人，其所天天放心不下的事情，還不在於身體之内的補，而是身體之外的服禦呢，「全家都在風聲裏，九月衣裳未剪裁」，這一句自由血嘔出來的詩，在這冬令的時候，不是替有許多人提出來正向這時令抗議嗎？</p>
<p>我所以一笑了之，而這一笑了之原因，也就在這裏。</p>

<p>他愛好閱報，將那看做一種工作。</p>
<p>「你以前不是說，不看報還令人心靜，一看報便該發狂嗎？怎麽現在愛好</p>
<p>閱報？」我這樣的問。</p>
<p>「以前的觀念是錯誤的。社會越萬惡，我們越應該面着社會的萬惡。報紙告訴了我們以社會的罪惡，我們應該研究社會的罪惡之根源，以求理論與事實是否吻合，然後我們向前勵進才能够到理論實踐的成功。」他却那樣冷靜地答</p>
<p>他不但不喝酒，也不吸烟捲啦！回力球塲更是於他如前世紀的古跡了。</p>
<p>他除了上課之外，就是在家裏讀書，寫稿，或會客談天，很少看他出門；雖是晚飯後在公園裏或者還可以尋到他的散步的行蹤。</p>
<p>我偶然問他，「曼麗呢？」</p>
<p>他沉痛的表情上帶着微笑地只摇一摇頭。</p>
<p>我後悔不該提起他的心事，掀揭他的創痕，我怕他又要發狂，我忙轉了話頭和他講一些關於那天的氣候太冷的閒話。然而，我的心裏是在問了自己，「他摇一摇頭，是表示着什麽意思呢？是說完了嗎？是說早已經不想起了嗎？」我是這樣地答覆了自己，「他是給悲哀的毒蛇咬過了心，連這心也麻木了。」　　第二次我去找他，他却失蹤了！</p>
<p>你莫急，聽我告訴你。</p>
<p>我去找他，正是他失蹤的第二天，一送門，你們那僕歐焦急半恾張地就問我，</p>
<p>「陳先生，你會過唐先生没有？」</p>
<p>「没有。」</p>
<p>「他，他昨天一出門就没有回家！」</p>
<p>「没有回家？」我才驚訝起來了。</p>
<p>「是的，没有回家。平時，星期一他是整天不出門我就奇怪」</p>
<p>，不料，他到今天還不回家！」</p>
<p>「他帶東西走嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有，只是穿着件舊棉袍，西裝也不換地就走了！」</p>
<p>他在家裏喜歡穿那件舊棉袍，說是比西裝還要暖和，我是見過的，但他出門一定是換好西裝才走的，而什麽穿那件舊棉袍出門，而且到現在還不回家呢</p>
<p>？｜我心裏就立刻不安起來了。</p>
<p>我打電話到每一個他的朋友的地方問　　都說没有來</p>
<p>將他的失蹤都告訴了；不一回，他的朋友都到你們的家裏來了。</p>
<p>大家都是追問着你們那僕歐，可是僕歐只能　　　些　！（　　　　自　）　　　　　　後就辭逸了。</p>

<p>美國方面；以著作「拿破崙」，「俾士麥」，「哥德」，「林肯」等歷史上偉人傳記得名的德愛密爾盧偉，最近他的傑作「拿破崙」，已爲米高梅購得攝影權，聘請他做該片顧問。盧偉雖是一個世界著名的傳記作家，對於影戲，頗感興趣，而且這次暢游好萊塢，認識了許多影界人物，其中以却利卓别麟最爲其所重視。他說卓别麟的一生事蹟，足够他寫一部傳記的材料，不過他以爲卓别麟的性格，極爲複雜，非有充分時間，不能詳細了解他的活躍的個性。最後盧偉到卓别麟所隸屬的聯美影片公司去參觀，剛好碰着滑稽明星埃第康多和一班聯美巨頭在一起。圖中（Ｂ）所示就是在聯美攝影塲所拍的，立於盧偉之右的一個人就是從前華納公司攝製「四十二號街」「歌舞昇平」的製片者賽納克。</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>平「彈性的女子」Ｂombshell</h3>
<p>— 凌鹤</p>
<p>電影藝人在没有好的題材的時候，便描寫自身之生活，這一原因，也許是因着一般人對於明星們的私生活十分羨慕，於是這明星私生活的素描，便成了釣魚的香餌了。觀衆的洋錢鈔票塞滿了製片商人的腰包。</p>
<p>另一方面說，影藝人以自身生活爲描寫對象，有如小說家描寫以小說家爲故事中心的小說一樣，一定可以眞切一些，因爲是描寫自己的原故。至於電影企業家出賣攝影塲之秘密，到底是一種</p>
<p>最後掙扎的可憐亦復可笑的方法。</p>
<p>「彈性的女子」和去年開映的「好萊塢花絮錄」等作品同樣，是明星們生活的記錄，正如上面所說，這種紀錄確實寫得十分眞切。</p>
<p>一個女演員，由於公司的宣傳部長之捧塲而成爲大名鼎鼎的明星。於是她的生活因之富麗舒適。許多男性追隨着她。她的一舉一動，都成爲報紙的最好資料。這時候，她不拒絶給她捧塲人之往來，同時也得和導演周旋。同時，又因爲父兄之無賴，使她對於一切醜態，欲蓋彌彰。他如陳舊的父母，不欲使兒子和醜惡的女明星結婚，所謂眞實的愛情，好像與她們無緣似的。</p>
<p>這些，應該是她們私生活的眞實寫照。但是編劇者却聰明的將李屈賽所飾的宣傳部長，寫成一個吊膀子的聖手，而說貴族子不能和女明星結婚，全是出於他狡滑的操縱，好像是解釋，在她們之間，並無其事。其實我們却覺得没有必要。反正醜惡的社會敎人們在醜惡中生活决不是膚淺的道德問題所可解釋的一切社會現象，都是我們的題材，可是當我們選擇題材的時候，我們一定得將好的題材嚴正的運用。我們固然不同意作者以粉餙的方法來掩蓋眞實，而他們更將這題材穿揷成輕鬆無聊的吊膀子故事，更爲我們所不取。然而在此，我們却可看出美國人輕率快樂的風度。</p>
<p>大輕鬆快樂方面，不僅是李屈賽和琪恩哈羅是最適當的演員，而導演也是深得此中三昧的好手。他將琪恩哈羅寫成典型的美國影星，這不僅是從擦粉塗口紅方面入手，而以女僕牽着三隻狗在她身上糾纒，更見深刻入微。至於李屈賽以其口齒流利的特長，飾一聰明活潑而厚顔的角色，亦有特殊的成功。自從「莫斯科一英雄」與「夜市長」等影片以來，他的胡調本領是不會使人忘記的。此外，佛蘭克毛根又演得很好。</p>
<p>至於佈景肯花錢，收音的淸晣，本來就是美國影片的特點了。存心娛樂的人們，未始不可快樂一塲。</p>
<h3>賈里古柏失戀而又得戀</h3>
<p>— 西林</p>
<p>日昨在申報電影專刋看見東林君的「賈里古柏的失戀」一段新聞，覺得那段文字，未免馬後砲了，因爲他在說賈里古柏失戀的時候，賈里古柏早已得着愛人，并且已經和她訂婚了。那個幸運的女子，呌做桑德拉蕭（Sandia　Shaw）。她本來是紐約的一個名門閨秀，原名呌Ｖeronica　Balfe。她有一位伯叔，呌做塞德列克吉朋斯（Ｃedric　Gibbons）是好萊塢的一位製片家，而他的夫人，就是那「蠻女天堂」的主角，桃樂絲德麗奥。桑德拉一年之前，來好萊塢訪問她的伯叔，而桃樂絲曾爲她而大張筵席，欵待賓客。許多製片家，在筵上看見了她，都驚爲天人，紛紛要求她拍戲。她先和雷電華訂了六個月的合同，後來又轉到高爾温。她雖是影界的後進，經騐未豐，不能做大角色，但是她的明亮的前途，是大家肯替她擔保的。不意後來她遇見了賈里古柏，就一見傾心，願意放棄了明星的前程，而嫁作影人之婦了。不久以前，她已經約了賈里古柏回到紐約，去覲見那未來的雙岳，預料不久之前，他們就會成爲多情眷屬的。</p>
<p>再則賈里古柏的雙親，對於他前此的一切羅曼絲，像和克萊拉查以及露潑范麗絲等等，都是極端反對的，但是現在他們對於這位桑德拉蕭，却非常贊成，并且說這位蕭小姐將來定是一位賢妻良母，所以他們二老，頗有佳兒佳婦而樂之的氣槪也。</p>
<h3>家室和睦亦要登報聲明</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>結婚要登報，離婚亦要登報，這都是普通的事。但是旣非結婚，又不離婚，也到登起報來，這就是奇事了。最近好萊塢的影星納爾漢摩頓夫婦因爲外間紛紛傳說他們不久就要離異，特在一家報紙上登了一個啓事，裏面說：「納爾漢摩頓先生及夫人兹特鄭重聲明，彼等</p>
<p>結縭來，十有一年，伉儷素篤。外間雖有種種流言，曾經本報及一切其他報紙所揭載，復有種種耳聞，口舌相傳：飛短流長，殊屬可畏。兹特奉告大衆，彼等已往之十一年，旣屬和洽無間：而以後無數之十一年，亦將繼續如此，久不更變」云云。觀諸以上之廣告，亦可見好萊塢爲離婚潮流所震蕩，足使一般人之家室，俱爲之動摇矣。</p>

<h3>婆心劇盜Ｂroadway　Thru　a　Keyhole（六）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>克拉克請她跳舞了，她更是受寵若驚的慌張起來。她在光滑的地板上，隨着狐步舞柔和的音樂旋轉着；她想要閉着眼睛，做一個無邊無際的美夢，她像在月光郎照的雲霄褒奔馳着，她所依賴的，祇是一個美男子的雙臂，將她的　腰很安穏地摟着。不久一夕告終，明日克拉克又來看她，以至天天來看她。他們同在海邊游泳，同在荒郊馳騁，同在棕櫚樹的凉蔭下，如夢如醉地臥着。等到日月無光，天上祗有羣星燦爛的時候，他們還在沙灘上徜徉着。就是在這麽一個晚上，克拉克第一次將瓊蕙蘭捲在他的懷裏，第一次他的唇合着她的唇。他將她摟緊的時候，她並没有一個的反抗，她竟闔上了眼睛，儘着享受她久已心愛的人的恣情的狂吻。</p>
<p>她怱怱回到旅館的時候，已經深夜了。在旅館的過道中，齊巧有羅其的一個盜黨，是瓊本來認識的，不過因爲瓊傲然地不理睬他，他懷恨了，立卽拍了一個電報給查克，呌他向羅其報告瓊蕙蘭的一切行動。過了五分鐘，羅其就來了一個長途電話，吩咐瓊蕙蘭立卽回紐約去。瓊回到紐約，羅其和查克在車站上迎接她，立卽將她送到她的庽所裏。瓊到了庽所，將大衣脫了，羅其就追問她在邇亞邇的事情，瓊起初還想隠瞞，後來羅其說出克拉克勃里安的名字，問着究竟是怎麽回事。他說：「我並不是不相信你，但是我一定要曉得我自己站立的地位。向來是我先顧到你，你自己亦明白。你說我待你怎樣怎樣的好，那都是我自己情願的，不用去提它。你亦不欠我什麽。祗是認識你，已經是我的報酬了。但是你比方要什麽變更，何妨說來大家商量商量」。瓊恐怕於克拉克有什麽不利，至終不敢將實情告訴他，僅僅說了一聲：「你還不知道我的心嗎？」羅其於是將她抱了起來，將她狂吻着。她一則不敢違背羅其，一則爲克拉克心痛着。</p>
<p>瓊蕙蘭回到紐約之後，不久就在報上看見一段小新聞，說克拉克勃里安因爲自邇亞邇某舞塲不告而别，被舞塲經理控告毁約，並要求賠償損失十萬元。她見了這個消息，如同大難將臨，惴惴不安起來。一天晚上，她的表演完了，她在化妝室裏正想卸妝，忽然房門有人敲着。她以爲是羅其，就喊了一聲「進來」。但是她在鏡子裏所看見進來的人，不是羅其，而是克拉克勃里安。她飄然地旋轉身來，被克拉克抱住了。她一時一切都忘記了，祇有克拉克火一般熱的吻。她低聲地喊道：「哦，克拉克，我想死你了。你拿我抱緊些，好讓我覺得你是眞的來了。我决不再讓你離開我了」。等到克拉克將她抱緊了，她突然打了一個寒噤，連忙把他推開，瞠着眼睛向着他道：「你怎麽來的？給羅其知道了怎麽樣」？（未完）</p>

The purpose of the government is to strive to safeguard national rights and liberate civil rights.

<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Wang Reads the Declaration, the Entire Audience Applauds</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Plenary Session has been in session for six days, with a total of one preparatory meeting, four general assemblies, three review meetings, and three meetings of the presidium. Dozens of important cases have been resolved, reflecting a spirit of sincere unity. After the Fourth General Assembly concluded its discussion of the declaration at 1:10 PM on the 25th, it was decided to continue with the closing ceremony. The committee members and the Panchen Lama successively entered the hall, and the secretariat notified all staff members to participate, totaling several hundred people. Chairman Ju Zheng led the ceremony. The Presidium originally nominated Chiang Kai-shek to deliver the closing remarks, but Chiang modestly declined, so Ju Zheng delivered the remarks, and Wang Zhaoming read the declaration. The entire audience applauded, expressing their support. Then, music was played and photographs were taken, and the meeting adjourned. The original text of Ju's remarks is as follows: "Fellow comrades, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is holding its closing ceremony today. I am honored to have been nominated by the Presidium of the General Assembly to deliver remarks. It has been six days since the opening of the General Assembly. During these six days, the central comrades have gathered together in a spirit of harmony and fraternity to discuss various major plans and have achieved satisfactory results. This can not only be reported to the comrades of our Party, but also to the people of the whole country. From now on, the goal that the comrades of our Party should unite and strive to achieve is to work with sincerity, without arrogance or concealment, with one heart and one mind, to save the country and ensure its survival, and to consolidate the foundation of the revolution. Internally, we must revitalize the countryside, suppress the Red bandits, and complete the work of political tutelage. Externally, we must unleash the power of national consciousness to seek the survival and development of the nation. All these important tasks are not only the responsibility of our Party, which must be carried out with self-criticism and perseverance, but also the hope that the people of the whole country will unite and assist in their implementation to the fullest extent, so that the country's crisis can be averted and the country's future can be bright. Today, I have little to contribute. I respectfully wish the Republic of China ten thousand years, the Kuomintang of China ten thousand years, and the health of all central committee members. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>

<h3>Fourth Plenary Session Sends Telegram of慰問慰問 to Troops Suppressing Bandits and Rebels</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Plenary Session unanimously resolved to send a telegram of commendation to the generals and soldiers who suppressed the bandits and rebels for their meritorious service in defending the Party and the country. The telegram reads as follows: "To Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and to all the generals and soldiers who are suppressing bandits and rebels: In the past year, external and internal troubles have been pressing on us. All our armed comrades have remained calm in the face of danger and have always been at the forefront. They have sacrificed their lives to defend the Party and the country, demonstrating the national spirit and proclaiming justice to the world in the Battle of the Great Wall, without regard to the enormous sacrifices. They have also achieved remarkable success in the various campaigns to suppress bandits, and the remaining bandits can be expected to be wiped out. Recently, rebels such as Li and Chen betrayed the Republic of China and illegally established a regime. Our soldiers pointed the righteous banner, swept away the rebellious atmosphere, and restored the foundation of the country, demonstrating the power and prestige of the National Revolutionary Army and consolidating the belief of the people across the country in supporting unification. All of this is due to the bravery, courage, and sacrifice of our armed comrades in defending the country. The General Assembly reviewed the battle reports and examined the news of victories, deeply cherishing and commending their loyalty and diligence. It has been unanimously resolved by the entire body to send a telegram of commendation to all the generals and soldiers who are suppressing bandits and rebels on the front lines. It is hoped that they will continue to fight to the end. The country is in a difficult situation, and we hope that you will make every effort. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China (printed)." (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama Visited the Mausoleum Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Panchen Lama went to the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 25th to pay respects. At 8:00 AM, he attended the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee at the Central Party Headquarters. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Accompanied by Chu Minyi, the Panchen Lama visited the mausoleum at 7:00 AM on the 25th and laid a wreath. At 9:00 AM, he attended the plenary session. The committee members all stood up to welcome the Grand Master, who had come from afar to comfort the border regions. At 3:00 PM, Shi Qingyang visited him and inquired in detail about the autonomy of Inner Mongolia and the situation in Tibet. At 5:00 PM, the Panchen Lama visited Dai Jitao and talked about the border situation and religious affairs for a long time. The Panchen Lama is scheduled to visit the committee members and ministers of various ministries on the 26th to return their greetings. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Wenyuan and Li Menglan, who once served as grain officials in Tibet, came to Beijing via India to petition the Central Government because Dalai's entourage surrounded the Dalai, oppressed the people, and prevented the Panchen Lama from returning to Tibet. They arrived a few days ago. According to them, although the Dalai had not directly interacted with the Central Government during his lifetime, he had not lost an inch of Tibetan territory and had always intended to cooperate with the Central Government. However, the Dalai's entourage controlled the government, suppressed the people, and alienated the Dalai. When we passed through India on the 19th of last month, we saw news of the Dalai's death. However, the Tibetan people are hoping that the Panchen Lama will return to Tibet to preside over political and religious affairs. Tibet has not been affected in recent years. This is because the revolutionary movement in India has not yet ended, and the United Kingdom has no time to take care of it. If the Panchen Lama can return to Tibet early to preside over the western border, the unity of all Tibet can be expected. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Inner Mongolian Representatives Conclude Petition Procedures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Inner Mongolian representative Nima Otsoor told a reporter that the 16 Mongolian representatives are completing petition procedures. After they are completed within the next few days, they will all leave Beijing and return to Mongolia. Before leaving Beijing, they will submit a written request to the Central Government and the Mongolian Committee of the Executive Yuan to explain the reasons for not accepting the autonomous measures. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Central Army Advances Towards Longyan</h3>
<p>Blocking Remnants of the 19th Route Army from Fleeing Westward</p>
<p>Chiang Ting-wen Goes to Tong'an to Command</p>
<p>Anhai Recovered, Fighting at Luoyang Bridge</p>
<p>Li, Chen, Chiang, and Tsai Send Representatives to Guangdong to Obtain Passports for Leaving the Country</p>
<p>(Xiamen) As of the evening of the 24th, the remnants of the 19th Route Army in Quanzhou had not made any indication. In addition to the main force of the Central Army pressing at Luoyang Bridge, the Ninth Division in Anxi and the Third Division in Tong'an are taking up contact at Xiwei to cut off the route to Longyan. Tsai Tingkai sent a telegram from Longyan to Quan, ordering Shen, Mao, Qu, and Zhang to lead their troops back to Longyan. However, the encirclement of the army has already been completed, making it difficult to break out. Currently, the remnants are stationed in the areas of Quanzhou City, Honglai, Anhai, and Nan'an County. The Central Army ceased its attack on the 22nd but continued its military operations, awaiting an indication after the deadline on the 25th. Chen, Li, Chiang, Tsai, and Huang Qixiang are all in Longyan. The Central Army advanced from Zhangpu to Nanjin on the 23rd and is moving towards Longyan. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Chiang Ting-wen issued a proclamation on the 24th, stating that he had received a telegram from Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, entrusting the commander of the forward headquarters, Chiang, to handle all administrative matters in Fujian Province. He also received a telegram from Executive Yuan President Wang, stating that the administration of the areas where the front line is advancing will be the responsibility of the commander of the forward headquarters, Chiang. In addition to reporting and forwarding, it is hereby urgently proclaimed. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Chiang Ting-wen left Xiamen at 7:00 AM on the 25th with senior staff members of the command headquarters and a company of guards, passing through Jimei to Tong'an to command the military. The troops of the Third Division of Tong'an advanced forward on the morning of the 25th and entered Touguan Bridge. They occupied Anhai in the afternoon. The original regiment stationed in the 19th Route Army withdrew to Qingyang on the night of the 24th. Anhai is 60 li from Quanzhou City.

<h3>People of Southern Fujian Condemn the Rebels</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Xiamen on the 22nd: "To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the Central Political Council, National Government Chairman Lin, Executive Yuan President Wang, Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, Xiamen Garrison Commander Chiang, all Route Commanders, all Army Division Commanders, Fujian Military Commissioner Du, and all Commissioners: We are shocked to learn that the rebel army of Shen Guanghan and others has telegraphed their return to the fold. Since this army occupied Fujian, its various crimes have been too numerous to mention. Its wagging its tail at a time of danger is even more unimaginable. This army has colluded with the Communists to harm the people and has committed evils together. There is no distinction between leaders and followers. Shen Guanghan, in particular, eliminated the anti-Communist militia in the Yan Yong area and created red terror for more than a year, making his crime even more heinous. Now, like fish struggling in a pot and mantises trying to stop a chariot, they want to preserve their strength with empty words in order to rekindle the flames. We ask, since the rebel army's rebellion, how much has the nation's vitality been destroyed by it, and how many people in Fujian have been killed by it? If they have any conscience at all, what else can they say except to retreat and apologize to the people of the country? We dare to ask for the meaning of eradicating evil and thoroughly annihilating them in order to cleanse the source of the disaster. We are extremely agitated and distraught. Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Congress of All Counties in Southern Fujian, Zheng Fengnian, Yang Tuoyuan, Lan Changze, Xie Ying, Chen Jun, Xia Wang, Yaohan Wang, Li Hou, et al. Imprinted on the 22nd." (Central Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Fourth Plenary Session Declaration</h3>
<p>National Consciousness Will Dominate the Future of National Affairs</p>
<p>Concentrate National Strength, Replenish National Power, Save the Nation and Seek Survival</p>
<p>Unite Sincerely and Accomplish the Great Task of Revolution and National Salvation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is as follows: Our Party held the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in the capital this time to review past work and examine future policies. Amidst pain and vigilance, we deeply feel that the past year since the Third Plenary Session has been a period of extreme internal and external difficulties. During this year, our Party and the people of the whole country have experienced unprecedented hardships in dealing with these successive changes. However, this process of hardship and struggle has given us an important revelation, that is, the great power of national consciousness will dominate everything. The future of national affairs and the revolutionary mission of our Party have coincided with the aspirations of the people of the whole country. This is what all the participants in this plenary session are inspired by, and it is also what they cannot fail to use as a source of encouragement. Tracing back to the time when the Japanese army occupied the three northeastern provinces, in January last year, there was the alarm at Yuguan, followed by the loss of Rehe. In the battles of Xifengkou, Lengkou, and Gubeikou, our soldiers braved the power of aircraft and heavy artillery, fought bloody battles, and defended their positions. More than 40,000 people were killed or wounded, and the loss of civilian lives was even more incalculable. This kind of heroic and tragic battle is rarely seen in the history of our country. This fully proves that the reason why our country has failed to achieve the goal of resisting humiliation and avenging its shame is due to the lack of national strength, but the morale of the soldiers is actually very useful. However, the reason for creating this heroic record is the mobilization of the national consciousness of defending the country with death. When the war in the north was tense, the bandit suppression troops were urgently mobilized, causing the dying Red bandits to take the opportunity to break through and run rampant again. However, since the encirclement and suppression plan was continuously implemented, all the soldiers were filled with righteous indignation and fought with twice the usual vigor. They repeatedly defeated the main force of the bandits, recovered important areas, and the effect of annihilation can be expected soon. The expectation and encouragement of the people of the whole country for the bandit suppression military operations are also unprecedented. This also fully proves that the Red bandits' conspiracy to use foreign troubles to endanger the nation and the race has only strengthened the reaction of the deep national consciousness of our military and civilians throughout the country. The victory of the bandit suppression military operations has already reached the point of success. However, Chen Li Nuo, a rebellious traitor in Fujian, suddenly lost his mind at this time and launched a rebellion to destroy the Party and abandon the country, with the aim of frightening people and shaking the foundation of the country. However, as soon as the banner of rebellion was raised, the whole country condemned it. The pseudo-government in Fuzhou was in danger in less than ten days and collapsed in less than a month. The advocacy of the rebellion was extremely bizarre, and the suppression was also unprecedentedly swift. On the day when the national army recovered Fuzhou, the national emblem of the blue sky and white sun flew all over the city, and the enthusiasm of the people to welcome it was truly like seeing the light again. This especially shows that the Three People's Principles of saving the country, left by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, are the true sustenance of the entire nation's life. Anyone who is ignorant of this principle and vainly hopes to make a plan for self-harm and self-destruction, once in contact with the vigorous and fiery national consciousness, will not fail to be defeated and destroyed. Looking back on the past year, every time the country encounters a crisis of survival, the potential national consciousness of the whole country will exert its great power once. We would like to express our highest respect and condolences to the soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country in the battles of resisting humiliation, suppressing bandits, and quelling rebellions. Reflecting on the past, we feel even more that in this year, the composure and firmness of the will of the people of the whole country, the clarity and correctness of their understanding, and their ability to maintain order and make arduous progress in the state of national hardship and rural decline are sufficient to be a guarantee for the revival of our country. This conclusion is especially to be presented to the whole Party and the whole country as a source of inspiration and uprising. The great plan of saving the country and seeking survival has myriad aspects, but it can be summarized into the following two guidelines: First, it is not enough to save the country and seek survival without concentrating national strength. Second, it is not enough to save the country and seek survival without replenishing national power. This is generally recognized by all enlightened people in the country, and it is also what our Party has been committed to over the years. Looking at the changes in national affairs and the trends in the international situation, we are even more convinced that these two major prerequisites are absolutely necessary to be realized. In modern times, the first element of nation-building is to make the country respond from head to tail and connect branches and trunks to form a tightly organized machine. The second element is to make the country's blood circulate smoothly and its body full, forming a healthy machine both internally and externally. If either of these two elements is missing, or if there is organization but no strength, or if there is strength but no organization, then it will not be enough to stand on its own in the international community, nor will it be suitable as a tool to promote the interests of the people. Therefore, from the perspective of national politics, both unity and construction are absolutely necessary. Anything that hinders unity and construction is hindering the great plan of saving the country and seeking survival. From the perspective of the elements that make up the country, whether it is all the members of our Party or all the people of China, unity and effort are absolutely necessary. Anyone who cannot practice unity and effort is delaying the great plan of saving the country and seeking survival. The danger of the Chinese nation is extreme. Lost territory has not been recovered, and those who seek to harm us are now borrowing the remnants of the imperial system and falsely claiming titles. If we do not rise up quickly to consolidate national unity, complete all construction, and establish the foundation for resisting humiliation, the country will inevitably fall into fragmentation and be beyond salvation. Moreover, the international situation is already pressing us. Therefore, this meeting, after careful consideration, believes that what should be revealed today is the clear outline related to the foundation of the country. All the paths that the whole country has confirmed as unchangeable are the goals that all comrades of the Party and compatriots of the whole country should unite and work together to achieve. What the country expects from our Party is not about much talk. What our Party is painfully vigilant about and takes as its own responsibility is only to practice it. This meeting believes that at this time, we should use the spirit of not being arrogant and not being afraid of telling the truth, overcoming selfishness and uniting the masses, to strive to consolidate the foundation of the revolution and establish the foundation for saving the country. As for the decisions made by the previous meeting, whether they have been hindered in the middle and have not been implemented, or have been in progress and have not been completed, and the plans of this meeting on various facilities such as politics, military affairs, economy, education, and Party affairs, we vow to promote them with a consistent spirit and concrete steps. We hope that the sincere unity of all comrades of the Party will create the sincere unity of the people of the whole country and our Party. We hope that the hard work of all comrades of the Party will move the people of the whole country, and we will expect each other to make double efforts, self-purify and self-sacrifice, and do our best to be sincere. With one heart and one mind, we will reverse the dangerous situation. The survival and development of the country and the nation, and the completion of the great cause of revolution and national salvation must be sought in the unanimous sincerity and efforts of the whole country. This is the declaration. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Another Alarm in Xinjiang Shu</h3>
<p>The largest central city in the southern part of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang has recently undergone a huge change. With the support of Hui chieftains, a so-called new government has been established. The content of this new government is still vague and unclear, even according to Reuters and TASS. What is known on the surface now is: first, the leader of the new government is a Hui merchant; second, it seeks independence and separation from China; third, it excludes Han people; fourth, it sends representatives to unite with the Kingdom of Afghanistan; fifth, it invites Hui people exiled in India and Japan to train troops. All of these indicate the opinions of some Hui people in Xinjiang Province, and their words of expelling Han people are especially enough to stir up the emotions of the Hui people. They believe that this kind of proposition conforms to the nature of history and can confront the Han people and achieve the results of self-determination. However, they do not know that Xinjiang is located between two major powers, and the Hui people in Xinjiang are still in the era of agricultural economy and cannot compete with the commercial economy. Once independent, they will only be used by foreigners and will not realize that they will become a continuation of India.</p>
<p>Many of the Han officials serving in Xinjiang Province are stubborn in their thinking. Not only is there no construction in politics, but it also makes the local Hui people full of grievances, causing neighboring countries to have ambitious desires and often covet them. Regarding this rebellion of the Hui people, we are reluctant to make harsh criticisms at this time due to the remoteness of the roads, the obstruction of transportation, and the extreme alienation of the relationship between the two sides. However, today, the political hub of Xinjiang Province is still in the hands of the Han people. If the provincial government can know the importance of this matter and quickly respond with sincerity, even if it is not enough to quell the rebellion immediately, it may be possible to prevent the rebellion from expanding further, so as to seek recovery slowly.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang incident has been revealed for a long time, and the central government has also paid attention to this early on. It has twice sent senior officials to Xinjiang to conduct on-the-spot investigations into the causes of past changes in Xinjiang Province and the essential ways to design governance in the future. Huang Musong's comforting has become a thing of the past, and Luo Wengan's inspection has just returned. What they contribute to the central government must be practical and feasible plans. Therefore, when the Hui people's problem in the southern part of the country suddenly breaks out, the central government will surely have a plan in mind and there is no need for us to worry about it.</p>
<p>Xinjiang has an area of ​​5.36 million square miles and a population of approximately 2.5 to 3 million. Some argue that Xinjiang is entirely barren, with a sparse population and a climate that is not very suitable. However, in fact, the Gobi Desert only accounts for one-fifth of the total area of ​​Xinjiang Province. Its hindrance to the survival of the population and the obstruction of the development of transportation are also limited. However, due to the separation of the Tianshan Mountains, it is divided into the northern and southern parts, and both the northern and southern parts have rivers flowing through them, with abundant water and grass, which are suitable for both animal husbandry and farming. In the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains, although it is called severe cold, it is at most only 20 degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale, which is better than the climate of Heilongjiang Province. The reason why the population is sparse and transportation is inconvenient is because the country has never paid attention to the northwest. Moreover, the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains is becoming more and more tense due to the independence of Outer Mongolia and the success of the Soviet-Western Railway.</p>
<p>Now the dispute between Hui and Han has gone from secret brewing to exposure. From the surface observation, it does not seem to be very serious. However, due to the years of famine and military disasters in Xinjiang Province, if those ambitious countries add to the sowing of discord behind the scenes and take the opportunity to profit, the resulting changes are really difficult to predict. Therefore, we believe that whether the affair in Shule is true or not, the government should quickly make arrangements and announce the policy of governing Xinjiang, so that the Han people have something to rely on and the Hui people can realize it as soon as possible in order to reverse today's decline.</p>

Sun's representative, Wang Shouxin, visited He on the morning of the 25th. Wang Lun met with him on his behalf and informed him that the central government's telegram still charged the branch with handling the matter. He's intention was to hope that Sun's army could quickly withdraw to its original defense area and hand over Dengkou and the occupied territory of Ningxia Province to the 15th Route Army for defense, and then develop Woye for reclamation. On the 25th, neither side sent a telegram to Beiping, and the situation on the front line was unclear. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hou Cheng, who was previously ordered to go to Taiyuan to meet with Yan Xishan, heard that the result was satisfactory. The Shanxi authorities are working hard to act as a third party to mediate and dissuade Sun's troops from advancing. As for the central government's handling of this matter, due to the facts, it must be carefully considered before a decision can be made. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of Sun's troops advancing westward, the two armies are still confronting each other for days. Pingluo is still surrounded by Sun's army, and the fighting in Ligangpu is even more intense. Sun's troops are now breaking through Ligangpu and heading towards the provincial capital of Ningxia. The troops of Gansu and Qinghai provinces are now actively advancing.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ningxia Provincial Committee sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, forwarding it to the Fourth Plenary Session, requesting that Sun's army be ordered to stop advancing westward and requesting a swift solution. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: Although the military authorities have strictly ordered to stop the conflict between Sun and Ma's armies, neither side has sent a telegram to Nanjing, and it is still difficult to know whether the war has stopped. It is said that the central government is quite dissatisfied with Sun's army's arbitrary westward advance and will order Zhu Shaoliang, the pacification director of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, to be responsible for stopping it nearby. Chiang Kai-shek met with Sun Dianying's representative, Lu Yuting, and Ma Hongkui's representative, Liang Hejun, on the 25th and inquired in detail about the Sun-Ma conflict.

According to what he told reporters, the military affairs in Fujian Province will soon come to an end, and he is going there specifically to take charge. The remnants of the rebellion are still being cleared up, and there are no other military post-war affairs. However, after Fujian Province has been ravaged by the rebellion, the people are suffering deeply, and attention should be paid to the reorganization of civil administration. The selection of county magistrates will be particularly careful, in order to alleviate the people's suffering and financial difficulties.

<h3>Japanese Military Strategy Against Russia According to a Certain Source</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, there are frequent clashes between Japanese and Russian outposts in the Dongning area. The Japanese strategy against Russia is divided into three routes: central, left, and right. The left route is in the Dongning and Suifenhe area, with mostly defensive works. The central route runs from Heihe to Mohe, with the aim of crossing the Heilongjiang River from Mohe and cutting off the Siberian Railway. A large motor road between Heihe and Mohe has been built, with a width of 48 feet, and many stations have been set up along the road, which seems to be taking an offensive stance. The right route is in Manzhouli, also on the defensive. The three routes are commanded from Harbin, and the general station is also located there. This is the first phase of the war plan. The second phase is divided into offensive and defensive sections. If the central route wins, the right route will also take an offensive stance.

<p>The Thief, Si Zhengmin, Has Been Arrested and All Stolen Antiques Have Been Recovered</p>
<p>(Jinan) Seventy-one antiques, worth more than 100,000 yuan, were stolen from the art exhibition room of the Provincial Library at 4 am on the 22nd. Han ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly arrest the thief. The thief's name is Si Zhengmin. After stealing the items that night, because there were too many to carry, he sank three Ming porcelain Longquan plates into Daming Lake outside the museum. When he went to retrieve them at 6:30 pm on the 24th, he was caught on the spot by Zhao Shiqi, a patrol officer of the Public Security Bureau of the museum. He was taken to his house to search for the stolen goods, but nothing was found. Now, he is being questioned in detail at the Public Security Bureau. His wife, Liu, confessed that they were hidden in the attic of the living room, where the tiles were lifted up, put in, and covered again. He was then taken back to search for the stolen goods, and they were all recovered without missing a single item. Si confessed that he used to be a worker at the Electric Light Company. After joining the Communist Party, he surrendered and became a member of the Anti-Communist Team of the Provincial Party Headquarters. Later, he was expelled and is now unemployed. He climbed over the wall alone that night. The people in the museum had not yet slept and were hiding in the women's restroom. He opened the door and entered to steal the items after four hours. Han decided to interrogate him personally tomorrow morning and then execute him. Among the stolen items, the Wucai Wanli Porcelain Vase, the Song White Porcelain Incense Burner, the Song Mingquan Burner, the Jiajing Plain Yellow Plate (eight in total), and the Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures are all worth a lot of money. There were Song and Yuan version samples in the room, but Si knew they were samples and useless, so he only stole the copied and unique versions. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Chen Zongcheng Summons Representatives of Workers in Beiping for Talks</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Zongcheng summoned representatives of workers from factories all over the city for talks at the auditorium of the Social Affairs Bureau at 2 pm on the 25th and inquired in detail about the labor situation. More than 30 representatives from the Tram Workers' Union, Danhua Match Factory, Beer Company, etc. attended. Chen Ponong, the section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, was present. Chen first described the nature of the International Labor Office and his purpose in coming to the north to investigate. He hoped that the representatives would report on the actual situation of the workers in detail so that they could study it together. Then, each representative reported one by one. Chen finally encouraged them with three points: (1) The International Labor Office is very concerned about the labor movement in China and is willing to cooperate with China to seek to increase happiness and strive to the end. (2) Chinese workers have always had the virtues of being hardworking and enduring hardships, which are unmatched by other countries. They should maintain this spirit from beginning to end. (3) At this time when the country is in great distress and the labor movement should be improved, it is hoped that they will unite and obey the government's guidance to deal with the difficulties with their entire strength. The representatives were very excited. The meeting lasted for two hours. According to Chen, the impression he got from this inspection was very good. The workers' lives are already hard, and the working hours are long. It is really necessary to improve this in the future. The International Labor Office is very willing to help the Chinese labor movement and improve the lives of workers. After Chen goes to Tianjin next week, he will return to Shanghai to prepare to attend this year's International Labor Conference. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Discovery of Japanese Kidnappers in Fengrun</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a report from a certain government agency in this city, Zheng Jiugao, a resident of Wangjia Village in Fengrun County, and the wealthiest man in the county, was suddenly confronted by four Japanese and three Chinese accomplices at 8 a.m. on the 25th. They drove a large cart straight to the village's security team headquarters.  They drew pistols and searched for Zheng Jiugao. Upon Zheng's appearance, they immediately forced him onto the cart and fled west.  County Magistrate Zhang Renli, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched one hundred police officers to pursue them. They encountered the bandits at Renjia Village.  The bandits opened fire and resisted arrest. After an hour-long battle, the bandits were overwhelmed and completely captured. They were handed over to the county government and then transferred to the Tangshan Public Security Bureau for legal processing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>British Envoy Departs for China</h3>
<p>(London) The new British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, departed today for Marseille to board a British company steamer bound for Shanghai. A considerable crowd saw him off at the station, including Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon and his wife, and numerous officials from the Foreign Office. The Chinese Minister, Guo Taiqi, was unable to attend due to illness and sent Dr. Chen, a member of the embassy, as his representative, presenting Lady Lampson with a bouquet of flowers. Minister Lampson, speaking to a Reuters reporter before his departure, said he was proceeding directly to Shanghai and expected to remain there for about ten days. He did not understand Chinese but hoped to learn it. Accompanying him were Lady Lampson and their three daughters; their son remains in England for his studies. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Progress in Technical Cooperation Between League of Nations and China</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Issues Report</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Joseph Avenol issued a report today outlining the progress of technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China in the areas of health, transportation, and transit, as well as on economic, financial, cultural, and administrative matters. The report stated that League of Nations experts were working closely with Chinese authorities with remarkable results, especially the three-year plan to reorganize health affairs, which included establishing hospitals in the capital and forming mobile medical teams. The report specifically mentioned the Shanghai anti-cholera vaccination program, stating that cholera has now been eradicated in Shanghai. In 1932, over one million people in Shanghai were vaccinated. Regarding road construction and water conservancy projects, the report stated that great efforts are underway, the most notable being the highway system. A total of 1,405 kilometers of highways have been built in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, connecting to Shanghai and linking with over 2,000 kilometers of existing highways. The road construction program envisions building 22,000 kilometers of new roads, with the project divided into five phases. The report also mentioned assistance to the silk industry, public screenings of educational films, administrative improvements, and the reorganization of telegraph and telephone services.

<h3>Great Fog in London</h3>
<p>City in Darkness, Trains Crash, Traffic Halted</p>
<p>(London) A heavy fog fell today in the London suburbs, the worst in years. Accidents occurred frequently, with thirty-seven known injuries. Reports of further incidents continue to arrive. The fog began at 3 a.m. and thickened an hour later. By 8 a.m., all of London was exceptionally dark. Workers were idled due to transportation disruptions. Some workers, unable to reach their offices, returned home to rest. Later, there was a heavy frost, making the streets extremely slippery. Some people were even seen ice skating in the streets. A transport truck, a bicycle, and five other vehicles collided in one location. Trains continued to operate as usual, but were later delayed due to the adverse weather. By 11 a.m., the fog covered all of London like a blanket, extending as far as 60 miles to Kent, Surrey, and Southampton. Visibility was limited to ten or fifteen yards. The small ferries across the Thames attempted to operate, but were forced to suspend service due to the weather. In the afternoon, the fog seemed to abate slightly in central London, but increased again at night. All parking areas in the city were full, as drivers, deeming the roads too slippery, parked their cars and took the subway home. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Four people have died and hundreds injured in collisions caused by the Great Fog in London. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Trends in Japanese Politics: Diet Thwarts Military Faction's Power</h3>
<p>House of Representatives Resolutely Attacks Military Interference in Politics</p>
<p>A Change Since the Assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the Seiyukai's first day of interpellation speeches, Tokonami Takejiro fired a major salvo, strongly advocating for the unification of political parties to uphold parliamentary politics. On the second day, Ando Masazumi went a step further, pressing the military on the issue of the military's statement that was sowing discord between the military and the people. Shimada Toshio also issued a warning to Prime Minister Saito and Hatoyama Fumio regarding this issue, attacking the military. The military's camp was unexpectedly weak in response, creating a deep sense that the military could be swayed. The Seiyukai is secretly celebrating its victory and plans to pursue the attack further in the budget committee. However, some believe that pressing the advantage too far would provoke the military's emotions, intensify the conflict between political parties and the military, and potentially lead to unfortunate incidents. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether they will continue the pursuit or stop at this point. The trend is highly noteworthy. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In this session of the Diet, the atmosphere in the House of Representatives is extremely tense, with Seiyukai representative Tokonami's speech advocating for parliamentary politics and Minseito representative Machida Chuji's advocacy of constitutionalism. Furthermore, Ando Masazumi's speech regarding the division between the military and the people had the effect of warning the military against rash actions. In the past, the Diet's approach to military issues was to abandon its right to deliberate on national affairs and simply go through the motions. However, in this session, the Diet is freely expressing opinions and deliberating on military issues. The intention is not to overthrow the military or oppose the military, but to uphold parliamentary politics. The efforts of the parties, whose credibility was damaged after the May 15th Incident, to restore their credibility can be seen here. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokonami Takejiro, a leader of the Seiyukai, strongly advocated for upholding constitutionalism at the beginning of his interpellation speech, while simultaneously advocating for the necessity of a united front among political parties. Machida Chuji, representing the Minseito in the House of Representatives on the 24th, expressed agreement with Tokonami's views. Finally, he added that in this difficult situation, cooperation among political parties to achieve a stronger and more powerful national policy is the most urgent task, thereby clarifying the party's position. This is further promoting an atmosphere of cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties, which is attracting considerable attention from all quarters. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Interpellations in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Jealousy of Our Country's Air Force Development</p>
<p>Saito Does Not View the Current Situation Optimistically</p>
<p>Will the Military No Longer Interfere in Politics?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The third day of the House of Representatives convened at 1:28 p.m. First, Hachisuka Saburo took the podium to discuss the Navy's Second Supplementary Plan, as follows:</p>
<p>For future disarmament conferences, fundamental countermeasures should be established. As for appearances, there have been many failures and few gains, such as the London Treaty. Is there any intention to revise or abandon it?</p>
<p>He also said, "There is the fact that American capital has invaded China's aviation industry. What are the authorities' views on this?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi rose to respond:</p>
<p>From the perspective of national defense security, we are carefully studying the fundamental principles of disarmament treaties or conferences, etc.</p>
<p>As for the development of the air forces of our neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, our countermeasures should be practical and effective. The government is also working hard to study this.</p>
<p>Next, Ogawa Gotaro took the podium and raised the following questions:</p>
<p>If a budget that favors military spending is implemented, it will only make the military-industrial complex more prosperous and have nothing to do with revitalizing rural areas. As a result, rural and urban areas will not be able to share the benefits equally. This unfairness is extreme. Is it ultimately the military's intention to strengthen the current capitalist system?</p>
<p>He also discussed the issue of military discipline as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding military interference in politics and political opinions of military personnel, what are the military authorities' thoughts on this?</p>
<p>He further discussed financial and economic issues as follows:</p>
<p>Does the meaning of the so-called "inconvenient to state" tax increase period mean that it will not be implemented in 1935? Before the occurrence of a disastrous inflation, is it necessary to carry out a comprehensive tax increase?</p>
<p>He also discussed other trade relations and trade balance policies, demanding a response from the government. Finance Minister Takahashi rose to reply:</p>
<p>Regarding the idea of imposing a special tax on military industrialists, the intention is that after the tax increase, the national finances will improve. However, on the other hand, there will also be the issue of not being able to avoid issuing deficit bonds, so it is better not to do it.</p>
<p>If taxes are not raised temporarily for a year or two, the people will have the resources to be active, so it is not advisable to be too drastic.</p>
<p>Next, Naval Minister Osumi replied:</p>
<p>Military personnel currently in service are prohibited from interfering in politics and should abide by this. If there are illegal military personnel in this regard, they should be dealt with. It goes without saying. However, military personnel, even in active service, cannot help but be concerned about politics, which influences national power. It cannot be said that it is unreasonable for them to cultivate political common sense in this sense.</p>
<p>Then, Army Minister Hayashi spoke as follows:</p>
<p>The procurement of military supplies is also carried out by industrialists below the middle class. National defense and politics are inseparable. Therefore, it is a natural and reasonable occurrence that those who are overly concerned about national defense may rise up to study politics or make political arguments. It cannot be said that this never happens. Ogawa further questioned:</p>
<p>According to the answers given by the Army and Navy Ministers, their tone seems to approve of military interference in politics. What is the Prime Minister's view on this answer?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito rose to reply:</p>
<p>There is nothing unreasonable in the answers given by the two ministers.</p>
<p>The Army Minister added:</p>
<p>My answer did not mean to approve of interference.</p>
<p>After this explanation, Ogawa's questioning came to an end. Next, Haraguchi of the Seiyukai began questioning: "Observing the current international situation, armaments are certainly necessary. However, under the pretext of an emergency, military spending has been abnormally increased, and the people cannot but have doubts. How will this be explained?" This was an investigation into the military budget problem, which Finance Minister Takahashi will answer. Afterwards, Nakano Seigo began questioning with sharp arguments, and the atmosphere in the Diet became tense. The gist of his questions is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and other cabinet members have very different understandings of the current situation. The Foreign Minister often uses "crisis" as a catchphrase, and responds handsomely to the recent pronouncements of the great powers. Does he ultimately have the determination to adjust the essence of diplomacy? Please respond. Regarding the issue with Soviet Russia, there is a sense of relying on something without fear. Is there an active passion to resolve the issue with the Soviets? Please also answer clearly.</p>
<p>Regarding the recognition of stabilizing the financial world, can a semi-administrative and semi-judicial industrial inspection agency be established, modeled after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission? Is there such an intention? Next, regarding the agricultural issue, he launched a more intense barrage at the government. Then he talked about financial issues, and his conclusion was as follows:</p>
<p>The crisis is not limited to 1936. There must be epoch-making reforms to deal with it. Currently, our country's trade is suffering from the blows of the combined economy, and the situation has not improved. Therefore, there are export control measures and production control organizations. But how to reconcile production control with the welfare of the masses? This leads to the necessity of financial control and the need to establish an economic general staff headquarters. Self-sufficiency within the country is not the spirit of a newly emerging Japan. In an emergency, there are unavoidable circumstances. In this situation, what is the understanding of the cabinet members?</p>
<p>Nakano's questions lasted for more than an hour and a half. Finally, Prime Minister Saito replied:</p>
<p>The government is not optimistic about the current situation and should work together with the people of the whole country to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>Afterwards, no ministers responded. Nakano again took the podium to demand a response, and the Diet became agitated. Foreign Minister Hirota then made a brief explanation:</p>
<p>In today's complex international relations, it seems appropriate not to make extreme remarks. We should be careful in this matter.</p>
<p>Later, Commerce Minister Nakajima responded, and the meeting adjourned. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>The House of Peers Will Follow Up</h3>
<p>Questioning on Military Discipline Issues</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the previous statement issued by the military regarding the movement to sow discord between the military and the people, Prime Minister Saito stated in his reply in the House of Representatives that he was completely unaware of it and considered it unexpected, and that the motivation for its publication was very weak. After consultations between various factions, the truth will be investigated, and an urgent interpellation will be raised at an appropriate opportunity. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kensei Nao, a member of the Upper House, has decided to raise impeachment-like questions to Prime Minister Saito, Education Minister Hatoyama, Naval Minister Osumi, and Army Minister Hayashi regarding thought problems and the revival of discipline and military discipline. The Diet atmosphere regarding this discipline issue is quite tense, and the government may not be allowed to rest easy. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Hirota and Wakatsuki in Agreement</h3>
<p>Japanese People Feel Like They Have Taken a Cooling Medicine</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito believes that Foreign Minister Hirota's response to Machida Chuso's question regarding the international crisis of 1935 is completely consistent with the opinions normally held by President Wakatsuki. Hirota's response this time can dispel the concerns of the people, and social unrest can be naturally eliminated as a result. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italian Public Opinion Ridicules Hirota</h3>
<p>Engaging in Aggression in the Name of Peace</p>
<p>Japan's Untrustworthiness Has Alerted Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Europe Should Unite to Deal with the Far East Problem</p>
<p>Rome: It is reported that the Japanese ambassador to Rome has been instructed by his government to make a friendly recommendation to the Italian government regarding Italian newspaper commentaries on Japan. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about an article by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently published in Hearst newspapers. Simultaneously, Italian newspapers are no longer silent about Foreign Minister Hirota's speech on the opening day of the Diet, and are publishing articles evaluating and refuting Japan's claim to be a pillar of peace in the Far East. Tavoncetti, a reporter for the important Fascist assembly's "Tribune" wrote an article containing mockery, stating that the result of Japan's advocacy of peace has been that the United States has decided to build 120 warships, and that the British, Australian, and New Zealand representatives expressed panic at the naval conference in Singapore. The article concludes by saying that the countries of Europe should urgently unite to deal with the Far East problem. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome: Several newspapers here have commented on Foreign Minister Hirota's recent speech in the House of Peers. The Labor Newspaper of the Pan-fascist Party concludes, "Is the Japanese-style peace the only possible peace in East Asia?" The newspaper quotes the words Hirota used to explain his so-called peace policy, comparing them with the facts in the Far East, and states that according to Hirota, what Japan seeks can be summarized as peace. However, Japan's plans to expand its influence continue unabated. When Japan wants to conquer East Asia, any country that hinders its progress, by whatever means, is viewed by Japan as a threat to peace, preparing for war. As we see it, this so-called country is implicitly referring to Soviet Russia. The "Tribune" also states that Japan believes that peace means that all countries can recognize the facts that Japan has initiated and developed. As of now, these established facts include the establishment of "Manchukuo" and actions in Jehol. Japan can be said to have done as it pleased in Jehol, apart from encountering weak resistance from China. As for the formal activities of the League of Nations Council, they cannot help but make people laugh. According to Hirota, after Japan withdrew from Geneva, "its commercial and diplomatic relations with other countries are closer and more amicable than before, which is fortunate." The "Tribune" then discusses the naval issues of Britain and the United States, stating that the United States has passed a bill to build 120 warships to strengthen the Navy in preparation for the naval treaty discussions in 1936, and Britain is concerned about ensuring the security of Australia and New Zealand, etc., because these places are sparsely populated and are the focus of Japanese imperialism, etc. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>A Troubled Autumn in Europe</p>
<h3>France and Germany Disagree on Disarmament, Austria and Germany Face Friction Again</h3>
<p>Austria Protests German Direction of National Socialist Movement</p>
<p>Will Bring Suit in League of Nations if Unsatisfied Response</p>
<p>(Berlin) Austria today formally lodged a diplomatic protest with Germany, stating that Germany should not secretly direct the Austrian National Socialist movement and declaring that if Germany's reply is not satisfactory to Austria, Austria will appeal to the League of Nations. According to reliable sources, it is expected that the German reply will not acknowledge this responsibility, so the League of Nations will soon encounter a major dispute again. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Germany Feigns Deafness and Muteness, Austrian Chancellor Reaches Point of Intolerance</h3>
<p>(London) The fact that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss says that Austria feels it has reached the point of intolerance regarding the activities of the National Socialist Party has caused the authorities of European countries to focus their attention on Berlin and Vienna. Dollfuss sent a note to Germany a week ago, strongly protesting interference in Austria's internal affairs. Austria has not yet responded. Those who pay attention to modern history point out that Germany is feigning deafness and muteness. What people generally worry about is that the debate on international law is playing out on the world stage, and the disarmament issue will be shelved behind the scenes.</p>
<h3>Austrian-German Territorial Dispute Brought to the League of Nations May Not Be Effective</h3>
<p>The Austrian Chancellor does not want to ask the League of Nations to stop the propaganda of the German National Socialist Party unless absolutely necessary, because he knows that this move will not only embarrass the League of Nations, but also exacerbate the existing resentment between Germany and Austria. Britain believes that Germany has not invaded Austrian territory, and it is doubtful whether Austria's appeal to the League of Nations is advisable or effective. Although Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that the League of Nations may intervene when there is a situation that endangers international relations, since the material evidence is not complete, it is feared that the impassioned speeches of international law scholars will not have a positive effect, but will only cause resentment. Austrians are now all arguing about politics, but the real difficulty lies in the provinces economically linked to Germany, which desperately want to resolve the dispute between the two countries. They are dissatisfied with Dollfuss, not without patriotism, but because trade with Germany is their only means of survival. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Rumors Spreading in Paris of a Secret Collaboration Between Japan and Germany</h3>
<p>(Paris) People here generally have a skeptical attitude towards the disarmament issue. Recently, there has been a rumor that Japan has a secret agreement with Germany. According to information obtained by reporters, Japan, in view of the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia, deeply feels the future loneliness of the Japanese people. In addition, the mutual assistance between the United States and Russia in manufacturing warships and aircraft is even more frightening. Furthermore, both Germany and Japan have withdrawn from the League of Nations, but currently, the two countries have not shown any cooperation on the disarmament issue in Geneva. Recently, the Japanese Ambassador to France, Saito, stated that Japan believes that the current situation of the disarmament conference seems to be too Europeanized. If attention can be paid to the global situation in the future, Japan can definitely rejoin the discussion. The United States now adopts the same attitude towards the League of Nations disarmament issue as Japan, because the United States does not want to interfere in Europe's own political problems.</p>
<h3>League of Nations, Upholding French Will, Formulates Three Disarmament Judgments</h3>
<p>After recently consulting with British Prime Minister Simon and representatives from other countries such as Belgium, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, France's attitude towards Germany has become increasingly tough. France will formally propose in the League of Nations to draft a disarmament treaty and hand it over to Germany to decide whether to join the discussion. The success or failure of this conference depends solely on this. The reporter has learned that the League of Nations Executive Council has formulated three judgments as follows: (1) France will never recognize German Chancellor Hitler's proposal to increase German military strength to 300,000 and retain semi-militarized organizations. (2) The Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference can proceed through diplomatic means, but the final negotiations should be held publicly in the Geneva venue. (3) In order to show its sincerity and sacrifice for the sake of the Disarmament Conference, France will submit all proposals to the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Recently, the trend of the Disarmament Conference is that Britain and France are indeed cooperating, and the United States, Japan, and Russia may all have representatives participating in the future. There will be a detailed discussion on disarmament in the Far East and all military actions. As for Germany, the outcome will definitely be slightly beneficial. (National News dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>France and Germany Have Different Views on Disarmament, British Cabinet Seeks a Basis for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon, chaired by Prime Minister MacDonald, which lasted for one and a half hours. Two main issues were on the agenda: disarmament and Anglo-French commercial relations. When discussing the disarmament issue, Foreign Secretary Simon presented the report of the Cabinet's disarmament sub-committee meeting of the previous day to the cabinet members for review. The content consisted of several recommendations drafted by specialized agencies, prepared to serve as the basis for a new British mediation. It is generally believed that this proposal is based on the following considerations: (1) Reducing the importance of the "disarmament trial period" and seeking a term that can satisfy Germany's desire for equality in armaments. (2) Germany's demand for 300,000 troops can only be recognized up to 200,000. An attempt will be made to find a compromise between the two. (3) In addition, a compromise will be sought on armaments, particularly with the hope that France can specify a period and quantity for its own armament reduction, but only on the condition that Germany simultaneously fulfills its obligations. The British government intends only to submit the foregoing proposals to France and Germany through normal diplomatic channels. These proposals can be modified during the course of the negotiations. After discussing disarmament, the Cabinet then reviewed the Austrian issue. Londoners are not very willing to submit this matter to the League of Nations, because the League of Nations is currently unable to deal with this matter effectively. It would be more beneficial if the countries geographically more closely related to the matter were to deal with it. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Balkan Pact Encompass Five Points</h3>
<p>Agreement on Mutual Non-Aggression</p>
<p>Disputes Subject to Public Judgment</p>
<p>Formal Establishment Expected by the End of This Month</p>
<p>(Paris) Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Romania are expected to sign the Balkan Pact in Athens at the end of this month. It is reported that the content of the pact includes the following points: (1) All three parties have agreed to a non-aggression pact; (2) All disputes, unless otherwise legally resolved or handled under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, shall be submitted to an arbitration tribunal for judgment; (3) Each signatory country agrees to the establishment of a permanent arbitration tribunal; (4) If an arbitration tribunal cannot resolve a dispute, the case shall be sent to the Hague Peace Tribunal or the League of Nations; (5) If any signatory country is recognized by the League of Nations as having been invaded by another country, the other signatories shall rise up and provide joint assistance; (6) If the political and territorial status quo of the Balkan Peninsula countries must be maintained, the signatory countries shall assist each other.

<h3>Strengthening Far East Defenses: Modernizing Singapore Naval Base</h3>
<p>Construction Progress Must Not Be Delayed</p>
<p>Dilapidated Warships Rushed for Repair</p>
<p>British Naval Conference Held in Secrecy</p>
<p>(London) The Singapore Naval Conference, held yesterday aboard the flagship HMS Kent of Vice Admiral Sir Frederic Charles Dreyer, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Station, has not released a single word so far. Although the Admiralty states that this is a routine event, public opinion generally believes that this conference is the preliminary stage for making decisions of great importance to the Empire, the world, and Singapore itself. To consider the communications of the Far East, Australia, and the Pacific, the future of the naval base must be decided. The representatives attending were the Commanders-in-Chief of the British naval forces stationed in China, the East Indies, and Australia, who are responsible for protecting British interests in the western Pacific. The agenda must include modernizing Singapore into a strong naval base. Although the British government advocates a hasty policy for the Singapore naval base, there is credible reason to believe that the construction program delayed by the 1930 Imperial Conference will soon be actively continued. This project includes building a double-sized dry dock, a warship repair factory, and strengthening general defenses. Currently, British warships in the East requiring repairs must return to the home country for that purpose; if there were a well-equipped base in the Pacific, thousands of miles of travel could be avoided. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Dispatching Additional Warships to the Far East is Untrue</h3>
<p>(London) The British Far East Naval Conference is currently being held in Singapore, with the HMS Kent serving as the venue. The matter is confidential, leading to rumors. Recently, a rumor from Hong Kong claimed that a large British fleet would sail to the Far East in the spring, and all Rainbow-class submarines would be transferred to China. When a Reuters reporter visited the authorities here today, they dismissed this claim as completely unfounded. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>US House Passes Naval Appropriations Bill</h3>
<p>Totaling Slightly Less Than 300 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Vinson Bill's Inclusion Unsuccessful</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed the naval appropriations bill. The Naval Affairs Committee originally intended to incorporate the Vinson Bill, which proposed the construction of 120 new ships, into the appropriations bill as an amendment, but it ultimately failed. According to the naval appropriations bill, $284,747,000 is allocated, of which $33,619,000 is for the construction of new ships, including several aircraft carriers and four 10,000-ton cruisers. Additionally, $18,880,000 is allocated for naval aviation, including $6,131,000 for the purchase of new aircraft. However, no funds were allocated for the replacement of the Akron airship, which was lost at sea last year. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Meets with Gu Zhizhong, Head of the Shanghai Journalists Delegation</h3>
<p>Liu Discusses Three Steps for Governing Sichuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chengdu, 24th: Liu Xiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan, met with Gu Zhizhong, head of the Shanghai Journalists' Sichuan-Kang Investigation Delegation, at his office at 2 p.m. on the 22nd. He stated to Mr. Gu that although Sichuan Province cannot yet be said to be well-governed, it is progressing towards a bright future. He, himself, has three steps for governing Sichuan: pacifying bandits, post-disaster relief, and development. However, due to economic and other reasons, these three steps cannot be carried out simultaneously. Currently, all parties in Sichuan are working hard to pacify bandits, and because the people have suffered greatly from bandits, they are generally able to rise up and resist them. Therefore, the elimination of bandits is not far off. Regarding post-disaster relief, Liu hoped that everyone would change their thinking to create a new Sichuan in the future. In terms of development, Liu strongly advocated the improvement of local products and the fundamental construction of industries. Finally, he said that the current education system is not suitable and advocated the adoption of a production system in secondary education. During the implementation of these three steps, Liu hoped that the central government and the people would provide guidance and assistance. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>Situation of the Panchen Lama's Arrival in Nanjing</h3>
<p>| Whether to Return to Tibet Depends on the Central Government |</p>
<p>Beijing News: Due to a telegram summons from the Central Government, the Panchen Lama came south to report on the recent situation in Mongolia and Tibet. He departed from Xilin Gol League on the 17th of this month, arrived in Beiping on the 19th, and took a special train south on the 22nd. He arrived in Pukou on the afternoon of the 24th. Prior to this, the National Government received the date of departure of the Panchen Lama and notified all Yuan, ministries, commissions, and military and political organizations through the Office of the Military Council, and each sent a representative to the station to welcome him. The Gendarmerie Headquarters also sent the 6th Gendarmerie Regiment and increased security from the station to the wharf to protect him. Those who arrived at the station to welcome him included Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan; He Yaozu, representative of Chairman Chiang; Chu Minyi, representative of President Wang; Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission; Zhao Pilian, Vice Chairman; Huang Musong, Deputy Chief of Staff; Chen Zhuo, Director of the Police Department; and all the staff of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Panchen Lama's Beijing Office, Mongolian representatives to Beijing, fellow villagers from Mongolia, Tibet, and Qinghai residing in Beijing, more than a thousand monks of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and three Tibetan representatives, including Huang Zhengqing, who arrived in Beijing from Gansu the day before. At 1:10 p.m., when the Panchen Lama's special train entered the station, the military band of the National Government and the Police Department played music, and the military police raised their guns to salute. After the train stopped, Dai Chuanxian first boarded the decorated car and presented a flower basket to express his congratulations. After the Panchen Lama accepted it, he presented each of the welcoming staff with a Hada scarf and shook hands with them to express his gratitude. Then, under the leadership of Dai Chuanxian, he got off the train and walked to the ferry. At 1:30 p.m., he crossed the river and landed on the shore. He then entered the city in a car with Dai Chuanxian and went to the Shennong Gang No. 5 Office to rest.</p>
<p>That afternoon at 3 p.m., the Panchen Lama met with reporters and released a statement, the main points of which were: (1) During my visit to Mongolia for several years, the Mongolians deeply felt the care of the Central Government and were able to obey its orders. Last winter, Inner Mongolia requested autonomy and held a meeting of princes in Bailingmiao. In order to convey the virtues of the Central Government, I rushed to comfort them on one hand and sent representatives to Beijing to report on the other. Therefore, the Central Government specially sent Minister Huang to Mongolia to discuss the matter in detail. After several twists and turns, this serious issue was resolved. Recently, I heard that the Mongolian representatives were dissatisfied with the autonomy plan approved by the Central Government. I have not seen the content of the plan, but I believe that the Central Government will have a way to resolve it. (2) I am deeply saddened by the passing of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. Currently, the Tibetan affairs are being handled by the regent. Politics and religion in Tibet are all as usual. I hope that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama will appear soon to stabilize the Tibetan situation. (3) It has been more than ten years since I left Tibet. In the spring of last year, I had the intention of returning to Tibet. Initially, it was due to the Rehe Incident, then to mediate the Mongolian situation, and recently I was summoned by the Central Government, which prevented me from going. As for whether I will return to Tibet at this time, it remains to be discussed. In short, I will follow the orders of the Central Government. I have not yet decided which route to take to enter Tibet. (4) This time, I will visit the central authorities to report on everything. I have no proposals for the Fourth Plenary Session, etc.</p>
<p>That afternoon at 2 p.m., after the Panchen Lama arrived at the office, Shi Qingyang, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Zhao Pilian, and others visited him successively. At 2:30 p.m., President Wang also visited the Panchen Lama's office and left after talking for about 20 minutes. Afterwards, Chairman Lin sent his Chief of Staff, Lu Chao, and Chairman Chiang also sent personnel to meet him. Upon learning of the Panchen Lama's arrival in Beijing, the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters sent a letter inviting him to attend the Fourth Plenary Session as an observer.</p>
<p>The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission believed that the Panchen Lama had traveled a long distance to Beijing to discuss border affairs with the Central Government and had worked extremely hard. Therefore, a banquet was held at 6 p.m. that afternoon to welcome him. During the banquet, Shi Qingyang and Zhao Pilian successively delivered welcoming speeches, and the Panchen Lama gave a thank-you speech. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>Progress in Bandit Suppression on the West Bank of the Gan River</h3>
<p>Xiao, Kong, and Zhang Factions All Thwarted</p>
<p>Yongxin Will Soon Be Recovered After Being Captured Again</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the Fujian Incident occurred last year, the Zhu-Mao pseudo-First Front Army has gathered in the Tai Ning, Jian Ning, and Ninghua area, and the military operations to suppress the communists in eastern Jiangxi have been quiet. However, the various factions on the west bank of the Gan River have been actively trying to restrain them. The bandits there were originally divided into three major factions: (1) Xiao Ke's pseudo-Eighth Army, commander of the pseudo-Gan-Xiang-Bian Military Region; (2) Kong Hechong, commander of the pseudo-Gan-E-Xiang-Bian Military Region and commander of the pseudo-Sixth Army Corps; (3) Zhang Shou, leader of the pseudo-E-Nan Military Region and leader of the pseudo-Southeast Soviet. When Xiao's bandits crossed the Gan River eastward from Wan Tai, Kong's bandits roamed from Shanggao and Gaoan through Xin'gan to the vicinity of Nanchang. Zhang's bandits attacked Yangxin and Chongtong in southern Hubei. This was because the bandits' nests were running out of supplies, and they had to leave their nests to loot. At that time, He Jian, commander of the Fourth Route Army, ordered Chen Jicheng, Liu Yinggu, Liu Jianxu, and the First, Second, and Third Columns to encircle and suppress them separately. Xiao's bandits, who crossed the Gan River, were defeated by the Wang and Luo Divisions. Gao Yongsheng's faction, which disturbed Gaoan, Fengxin, and Jingan near Nanchang, was also defeated by Tan Daoyuan and others. Gao Cun, his old nest in Wanzai, was also recovered by the Zhong Brigade. As for Zhang Shou's pseudo-1st, 7th, and 3rd and pseudo-North Jiangxi divisions, about 4,500 men with about 2,300 guns, after being driven back by Chen Jicheng and the Guo Rudong, Li Jue, and Feng Xingxian divisions, they fled to Daqiaopu, Zoumalu, and Zijing Mountain and were surrounded and severely attacked by Chen's forces, killing many bandits. Overall, the bandit forces seem to be incapable of anything.</p>
<p>Liu Yinggu, of the Second Column, convened a military meeting in Pingxiang to formulate strict military plans and political post-disaster plans for the central route of western Jiangxi. The Rural Cooperation Committee is organizing work relief in Pingxiang, Lianhua, and Ninggang. Yongxin County, after being captured by the bandits again, has not yet been recovered. Moreover, after Wang Dongyuan and Chen Guangzhong's divisions went south to Chongyi to take over the defense, the local forces were weakened. The defense has been redistributed and, after deployment, Yongxin will be recovered in one fell swoop. (January 22)</p>
<h3>The Course of the Hui Tong Steamer's Burning and Destruction by Bandits</h3>
<p>Three to Four Hundred Passengers Perished</p>
<p>Hankou Shipping Guild Dispatches Steamer to Recover Bodies</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Hui Tong small steamer, which plies between Hankou and Huangshigang, departed Huangshigang on the 20th, fully loaded with passengers and cargo heading west. That evening, while passing Baho Wharf and arriving near Yanji, it suddenly burst into flames. Hundreds of passengers perished simultaneously, and cargo losses were estimated in the tens of thousands. The steamer is owned by the Chunhe Company and is currently managed by the Jianghan Shipping Bureau. It originally sailed the Xiang River and recently began plying the Huangwu route, this being only its third voyage. After the incident, the company established the Hui Tong Steamer Disaster Temporary Relief Center at the Minquan Hotel on the 22nd, providing shelter and relief to the fifty-odd passengers rescued by the China Merchants Bureau's Jiang'an steamer. On the 23rd, the Shipping Guild dispatched the Hanfu steamer to recover bodies. In the past two months, two accidents have occurred involving Hubei Province's small steamers. On December 11th of last year, the Luan差 steamer was sunk by the Wanxiang steamer, and hundreds of new recruits were buried in the bellies of fish. Unexpectedly, not long after, the Hui Tong was burned. Three to four hundred passengers, half died by fire and half by water, making it even more cruel than the previous incident. Therefore, people in society are paying close attention. To clarify the truth, the reporter specially visited Xu Chunzhai, the manager of the company, at the Minquan Hotel. According to him, on that day, the steamer was heading west when several bandits, disguised as passengers, reached Yanji near Baho and suddenly brandished pistols, forcing the steamer to stop. While they were arguing, a fire suddenly broke out in the cabin, and the cargo of leather, oil, and cotton was ignited. Unable to be rescued, it sank. The bandits had prepared small boats in advance, used them to escape. The reason the bandits set the fire was because they had attempted a robbery in the Yanji area last week but failed. Nine members were captured by the crew and sent to the 47th Division Artillery Battalion stationed in Baho for interrogation. Two were executed, and the rest were released. Now, they have caused trouble in Yanji again, likely due to the suspicions and revenge of the bandit gang. According to another investigation, the fire was caused by cotton and oil loaded on the deck. The oil was steamed by the heat from the boiler and rolled down, catching fire. The boiler was burned and exploded, becoming uncontrollable. The steamer carried a lot of cargo and was overcrowded with passengers. Passengers filled the top of the deck. After the fire broke out, they all perished in the flames. The rest fell into the water. The so-called bandits setting the fire may be to shirk responsibility. The competent authorities for small steamers are the Navigation Administration Office of the Construction Department. Originally, small steamer inspection stations were set up in Wuxue, Tuanfeng, Baotazhou, and Hankou. However, due to the headquarters' order to reduce staff, the three stations in Wuxue, Tuanfeng, and Baotazhou were abolished, leaving only the one in Hankou. Therefore, small steamers departing from Hankou to other places can still be inspected, but those coming to Hankou from other places cannot perform their duties. The route survey and crew examinations were originally handled by the Navigation Administration Office but are no longer under its control. Before the Hui Tong incident, it had run aground several times. The mate was newly replaced, and the route survey and crew examinations may also have been negligent. The company's greed for loading more goods was the source of the disaster. The authorities have decided to deal with this strictly. (24th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Murderer Escorted to Suzhou for Appeal</p>
<p>The case of the murder of the owner Xi Weiquan and his wife of the Xiyongda Rice Store on Huayang Bridge, involving the arrest of the principal offender Shen Ahe, as well as the deceased's brother Xi Weisheng, concubine Song Xiaomei, and unrelated robbers Shen Abing and Wu Zixiang, has been thoroughly investigated by the Songjiang County Court. Xi Weisheng, Song Xiaomei, and Shen Ahe were sentenced to death for premeditated murder. The robbers Shen Abing and Wu Zixiang were each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. The convicts, being dissatisfied with the verdicts, filed appeals with the Jiangsu High Court within the statutory period. The High Court approved the appeals and scheduled a hearing for the 27th of this month.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Octogenarian Marries</p>
<p>At the Da Hongyun Auditorium on Daoqian Street inside Xumen, an eighty-year-old man recently married a twenty-eight-year-old virgin, causing a sensation. Tea houses and taverns spread the news as a good story. It is now known that the man's name is Shen Hongxi, and he is seventy-nine years old. He is from Qingpu and owns 3,000 mu of fertile land and 300,000 yuan in cash. He has two sons, one doing business in the area and one working in the banking industry in Shanghai. His eldest daughter-in-law is also fifty years old. However, his wife passed away early, so he handed over the family property to his sons and daughters-in-law to manage, and built another house to live with a widowed woman he had living with him. The bride's surname is Xu, and she lives in Cao Hu Xu Lane in Suzhou. She is a cousin of Shi Junqing, the current chairman of the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce. The root of this matter is that the old man had an affair with a woman he had hired, but the eldest daughter-in-law rebuked and drove the woman away. The old man was angry and took back half of his family property, vowing to marry one wife and one concubine for his amusement. It is heard that the choice of the concubine is being sought and negotiated.</p>
<h3>Puyi Orders "Dragon Robe" to be Woven in Suzhou: A Rumor</h3>
<p>Suzhou silk and satin used to be sold to China and abroad during its golden age. During the Qing Dynasty, a weaving office was specially established, and officials were assigned to manage the tribute items. It is heard that recently a Japanese trading company in Shanghai came to Suzhou to order the weaving of "two pieces" (i.e., weaving a dragon robe) for Puyi to wear when he ascends the throne during his self-proclaimed reign on March 1st. However, it is difficult to find which family is taking on the weaving order as the matter is highly confidential. It is also being investigated that most of the looms in the industry used to weave this "two pieces" are no longer available, so it is difficult to find out for the time being.</p>

It is now heard that the Provincial Government has approved the Ministry of Finance's reply, which briefly states: "Regarding the earlier dispatch from your Provincial Government, Jian Zi No. 128, we have already ordered the Lianghuai Transport Commissioner to telegraph that the construction of the Sanhe Dam requires approximately 50,000 yuan and that Shao Wenbin is responsible for the concurrent management, etc. We have also approved it in a telegram. We are hereby replying for your information." With the funds for the project secured, it should not be difficult to complete it on schedule.</p>

<p>Siyang County Magistrate Requests Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Siyang has long been known as a bandit-ridden area, especially the northwest two townships. Now, in the Beixiang Lirenji Beiyangzhuang area of the county, the notorious bandit Ding Zhaohuai and others have taken advantage of the current heightened winter defenses and the transfer of local troops to gather their followers, forming groups and looting everywhere. After receiving the news, the provincial security team stationed in the county, together with the police brigade, went to suppress them. However, the bandits were numerous and powerful and could not be wiped out by a small number of troops. Therefore, on the 21st, the Siyang County Magistrate Chen Weijian telegraphed Li Shouwei, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Provincial Security Guard stationed in Pu, requesting the dispatch of troops to suppress the bandits. Today (22nd), Commander Li, in addition to telegraphing the 3rd Battalion stationed in Zhongxingzhen to rush to assist, also dispatched two companies from the 2nd Battalion stationed in Pu to provide aid.</p>

The adulterous couple regarded Ji Quan as a thorn in their side and secretly conspired to murder him. Liu氏 asked Tang Baohua's father to help. Together they strangled Ji Quan to death. Afterwards, the deceased's young son leaked the secret, and the Public Security Bureau solved the case. The three murderers were arrested and sent to the court for trial. The criminal court sentenced Tang Baohua and Ji Liu氏 to death for jointly plotting the murder. Tang Zhilian, the accomplice, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Bai Weixiang, the township head of the Second District Gongtian Township in this county, was accused by Xu Yongnian and other villagers of the area for shooting dead seventeen poor people during the flood in the 20th year. The former Cheng Cheng, the person in charge of trials, ruled that Bai was guilty of instigation and sentenced him to five years in prison. Bai refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Suzhou High Court. The court has completed the trial, ordering the release of Bai on bail. Xu and others appealed to the Supreme Court, and the court ordered the steaming of bones for examination. After the county government received the order, it has been decided to start the examination at the Gongtian Temple in the Second District on the old New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Six Bandits Executed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Security Office found that Zhu Rensheng (Laoyashun Sheng) was a bandit in the Chongde Yima area. He repeatedly colluded with others to kidnap Dr. Wei Boqin on a boat on Tang Bridge in Tongxiang and demanded a ransom of eight thousand yuan. He also joined others in robbing the police station of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Gongtang, Hang County, taking guns, bullets, silver, and other items. He fled to Shanghai and was tracked down and captured. The kidnapped person and wooden shell guns were found in Yima. Fifteen suspects were subsequently arrested, confessing that the case was led by an Anhui fugitive. Zhu Rensheng, Zhang Fuxue, Zhu Xiangqing, Zhu Donglin, Zhu Shunfang, and Shen Awang all admitted to jointly committing the robbery and kidnapping and were sentenced to death according to law. Yesterday, the identities of the six bandits were verified, and they were escorted to the border area between Hangzhou, Chongde, and the three counties for execution by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Leader of Sheng County Bandits Escorted to Ningbo for Trial</p>
<p>Li Shibin, a notorious bandit from Sheng County, twenty-nine years old, was the leader of the Sheng gang in Shanghai. After the kidnapping case on Jinlong Street in the British Concession in Shanghai occurred several years ago, the Municipal Council was arresting people very urgently. He knew it would be difficult to stay for long, so he fled to the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area. He committed kidnapping again in that area, so he was no longer tolerated by the authorities. He fled to Shaoxing, where he has been hiding for more than two years. Zhao Yisheng, the chief of the Second Security Branch in Ningbo, received a secret report knowing the location. He dispatched Zhao Shunfa, the captain of the security bureau's detective team, deputy captain Jin Yuting, and other detectives, who traveled to Shao overnight. Yesterday, Zhao and others captured the bandit Li Shibin at Ren's house on Huafei Street in Shaoxing, and took him to the Ningbo Security Bureau for interrogation. Yesterday, Shao Liyuan, an accomplice of the Li bandit, was captured at the Longshan Teahouse in Shaocheng and taken to the Ningbo Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Cai Yuanpei Left for Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Attending Today Morning's Central Supervisory Committee Plenary Session</p>
<p>Ratification of the Expulsion of Li and Chen from the Party</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee closed yesterday afternoon and the Central Supervisory Committee's Plenary Session will open in Nanjing at nine this morning. In addition to the Supervisory Committee members staying in Nanjing, Cai Yuanpei, a Supervisory Committee member in Shanghai, also left for Nanjing by train at three yesterday afternoon to attend the session. It is heard that the meeting will discuss the ratification of the expulsion of Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others from the party. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cai and Chen Go to Nanjing: Central Supervisory Committee member Cai Yuanpei has not been to Nanjing for a long time due to his poor health. Yesterday, Cai received a telegram from Nanjing urging him to go to Nanjing to attend this morning's Central Supervisory Committee Plenary Session. He immediately left for Nanjing by train at three yesterday afternoon with his wife. Central Supervisory Committee member Chen Bijun also came to Shanghai for business a few days ago and took the night train to Nanjing last night to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Discussion Content: The Central Supervisory Committee's Plenary Session was convened once before the New Year, but it was adjourned due to the lack of a quorum. This time, taking advantage of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee being held in Nanjing, a plenary session was convened to discuss more important agenda items, the most important of which is the ratification of the expulsion of Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Chen Youren, and Nai Fangzhenwu from the party. In addition to the Central Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing, including Lin Sen, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Zhang Ji, Wu Zhihui, Shao Lizi, Liu Yazi, Zhang Xueliang, Chu Minyi, and Enke Batu, Cai Yuanpei and Chen Bijun have arrived in Nanjing one after another yesterday to attend the meeting. This time, there are enough members to form a quorum, so there should be no problem of adjournment.</p>
<p>Cai's Remarks: Before leaving Shanghai yesterday afternoon, Cai told reporters who visited him that he had only received the notice yesterday that the Central Supervisory Committee was convening a plenary session. He had planned to go to Nanjing before the Fourth Plenary Session, but he had postponed it repeatedly due to his poor health. Although his health is slightly better than before, going to Nanjing is still a struggle. He is not very familiar with the agenda to be discussed at this plenary session, but the ratification of the expulsion of Li and Chen (Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu) and others from the Kuomintang is one of the items to be discussed at the meeting. Because there were not enough people present at the last Central Supervisory Committee meeting, it was adjourned. This time, it is hoped that it will be held successfully and that it will not be a problem. He has to attend the China Education Foundation Committee of the Sino-American Geng Funds this time, so he plans to stay in Nanjing for a few more days. He will return to Shanghai after the committee meets on February 2nd.</p>

<h3>China and Britain Did Not Stop Test Reporting</h3>
<p>Engineering and Reporting Tests are Currently Underway</p>
<p>The Results of the 24-Hour Test Reporting Were Very Good</p>
<p>Wen Yuqing Went to Nanjing to Ask for the Official Reporting Date</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reported that the China-UK report being prepared by the International Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications has been tested for 24 hours non-stop by the International Radio Station from the 15th of this month. According to the spokesperson of the station, since the China-UK report has been tested for 24 hours non-stop, the daily results have been very good. According to the original plan, the non-stop test report was originally scheduled for one week. In order to carefully check every part of each component and each project, the test reporting period was extended to avoid failing. However, according to the daily test results, all the components and parts of each machine have been completed. In the future, official reporting will be able to cope with it easily. It was previously rumored that the Ministry of Communications had tentatively set the opening ceremony of the China-UK official report for the 3rd of next month and would be held at the Zhenru Radio Station. The exact date has been asked by Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Administration, who is visiting Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, in Nanjing.

<h3>Money Industry Leader Qin Runqing Publishes Opinions on Currency Revolution</h3>
<p>Recent Cash Surplus Does Not Imply Money Shortage</p>
<p>Issuing Non-Convertible Currency Will Lead to a Dead End</p>
<p>The "Ability Standard" System Is Extremely Difficult to Implement in Our Country</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Qin Runqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, recently replied to a letter from Legislative Yuan member Jiao Yitang, stating: "Mr. Yitang, upon returning from Ningbo, I received your letter. I deeply admire your plan for a currency revolution to save the nation. However, in my humble opinion, the theory of the 'ability standard system' is somewhat fanciful and can only serve as material for scholars to discuss. It seems difficult to implement in the immediate future. Take our country as an example. From exchanging cloth for silk to casting currency and establishing a monetary system, people have been accustomed to using coins for thousands of years. Only recently has paper money become popular, but it is always based on full cash reserves. If a company suspends convertibility, panic ensues. Ignoring distant events,</p>
<p>The Scars of Wuhan Have Not Yet Healed. The Wuhan cash concentration incident occurred seven years ago, and Hubei's finances have not yet recovered to their former state. The plight of bill holders at that time is still fresh in my mind. If the limited amount of non-convertible paper money caused such severe harm in one area, then the unlimited issuance of substitute vouchers planned by Mr. Liu would almost certainly drive the people of the country into destitution. Recently, there have been widespread reports of a cash surplus in the country, and I have not heard of a money shortage. If it is said that the countryside is poor, this is fundamentally due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, leading to rural bankruptcy. Even if Mr. Liu's plan is implemented, those who rely on claiming the substitute vouchers would only be the wealthy. The common people in the countryside have no possessions, and even finding enough to eat is difficult. Where would they get the capital to exchange for vouchers? Moreover, the result of excessive issuance of substitute vouchers would inevitably lead to soaring prices. Even if wages could be increased, the rate of increase would be difficult to keep up. The consequences would be that farmers and workers throughout the country would be driven to desperation and take desperate risks. Although the world is evolving daily, the term 'paper standard' remains an ominous term in economics.</p>
<p>Germany's Experience Serves as a Warning. After the Great War, Germany lost battles and territory, and owed hundreds of millions in reparations, leaving its finances in dire straits. The Minister of Agriculture was at a loss.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to use the printing press in place of the mint, with bundles of paper money being taken to the market to exchange for a loaf of bread. There were many people in the country at the time who had lived there. The state of national commotion, with no one able to live in peace, is not</p>
<p>difficult to recall. If Mr. Liu's words were true, then Germany would have implemented it long ago and should have wiped away the shame of defeat and become invincible. Why, then, did they immediately reform the currency system and destroy the old, excessively issued paper money as soon as they had a way out, fearing that they would not be able to do so completely? Furthermore, although the idea of ​​currency inflation is advocated by the United States, the United States is suffering from overproduction, while my country is suffering from underproduction. The situations are completely opposite, so how can we force a fit? Moreover, the United States' currency inflation plan also focuses on gradual progress. Therefore, even though it is known as the "Gold Dollar Kingdom," it has hesitated to issue a plan for some non-convertible bonds, and has not yet implemented it. At most, it will only reduce the gold dollar component.</p>
<p>Technocracy. This is a term in "technical politics," originally coined by a veteran of that country. It was not initially valued by scholars. Only in recent years, with the New World shrouded in depression and unable to recover, did Americans, in their resentment, suddenly hear of the novelty of the theory and spared no effort to spread it, treating it as a rare commodity. By the time President Roosevelt took office, the situation had been renewed, and the project had gradually succeeded. Thus, the term "technocracy" faded away like a flash in the pan and is about to become a historical term. Why do people treat it like worn-out shoes, while we still cherish it like a precious treasure, considering it to be on the same path?</p>
<p>Currency Needs Are Inherently Small. To say that the average amount of silver coins in the hands of people throughout the country is less than three yuan, and to regard this as evidence of chaos and money shortage, is not an accurate argument. We do not need to look back to the rule of Emperors Yao and Shun. Even in the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the country was at peace. The wealth of the country at that time was far beyond what we can imagine today. How much currency did the people of the whole country have in their hands at that time? Even Mexican silver coins from that time can still be seen in the coastal provinces. Even the total value of copper coins is less than one-tenth of today's copper coins. It can be seen that the amount of currency has nothing to do with national strength. It all depends on the evolution of the people's living standards for increase or decrease. For example, the cost of living in the United States is extremely high, and ordinary wages cannot be less than five or six yuan per day. Therefore, the amount of currency needed is naturally large, and the amount of currency in the hands of each person is also large. The same applies to the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. As for our country, the cost of living is low. A daily wage of two or three yuan is only seen in major trading ports, and a family of seven farmers and workers can live comfortably on tens of dollars a year. Since the need for currency is small, the amount in hand cannot be compared with that of the United Kingdom and the United States. If we add inflation, it is no different from feeding an adult's portion to a child's stomach, which will inevitably cause bloating and premature death. In short, even the "ability standard system" is something that the Soviet Union is still hesitant to implement. To say that it can achieve long-term stability and prosperity in our country, I am unlearned and cannot fathom its profoundness. I have taken the liberty of answering your questions and offer my humble opinions. I hope you will forgive my candor and remain in good health.</p>
<h3>Korean Ahn Chang-jin Arrested Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Cotton Industry Control Committee Central China Investigation Team Departs</h3>
<p>Led by Liu Jusheng, First to Hankou</p>
<p>Then to Henan and Other Places for Investigation</p>
<p>The National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Committee, in order to investigate the situation of the cotton industry throughout the country, has organized investigation teams that have set off in different directions. It is reported that in addition to the investigations into cotton raw materials and textile and dyeing factory manufacturing that have already begun, the production and sales of cotton textiles nationwide are also on the predetermined investigation list. The Marketing and Transportation Department has already organized the Central China Investigation Team, led by the head of the team, Mr. Liu Jusheng, to first go to Hankou, and then to various places in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan for on-site investigations. At the same time, letters have been sent to the provincial governments and relevant organizations such as the Municipal Government General Chamber of Commerce and Cotton Industry Association of each port to provide convenience when the investigation team arrives.</p>
<h3>Joint Chamber of Commerce Submits to Zhejiang Finance Department Requesting Exemption from Business Tax for Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Products Factory Joint Association has submitted a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department, requesting that the Hangzhou National Products Exhibition Hall, which has recently been forced to pay business tax by the Zhejiang Provincial Business Tax Bureau, be exempted from taxation in accordance with regulations. The original document is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Joint Chamber of Commerce: The Hangzhou National Products Exhibition Hall writes to the Joint Chamber of Commerce, stating: "The National Products Exhibition Hall is a part of the entire National Products Exhibition Hall. Merchants participate in business and are in a position to assist the government in promoting national products. According to the principles of the Business Tax Law, government-run enterprises are not subject to taxation. However, exhibition hall shops are subject to restrictions everywhere and are not comparable to shops that are purely for profit. According to the law, there is no possibility of taxation. The Capital National Products Exhibition Hall, the Shanghai Commodities Exhibition Hall, and the National Products Exhibition Halls in Hebei, Hunan, and other provinces all exempt business tax for shops in their attached business areas. The original intention is very clear, and the method is very appropriate. However, the Zhejiang National Products Exhibition Hall is also under the rule of the National Government. Repeated requests have been made to exempt the business tax of the shopping mall, but they have never been approved. The business nature is the same, so how can the government's treatment be different? The total amount of business tax to be levied in the entire venue is only more than 1,000 yuan. The sluggish business of the shopping mall is on the verge of collapse. If it is exempted, it will not have any impact on the overall tax revenue of Zhejiang Province, but it will have endless benefits for the continuation of the life of national products. Recently, the Business Tax Bureau has been urging the shopping mall to pay taxes, and the entire venue is in a state of anxiety and panic. It is generally believed that the business of the shopping mall is precarious, and the government does not maintain or rescue it. How can it be willing to rob Peter to pay Paul? It is inappropriate both legally and emotionally. It is decided to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance again and send telegrams to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the tax exemption be achieved. Otherwise, any sacrifice will be made. It is highly expected and grateful to be able to appeal to your association to lead the national products and establish a reputation."</p>
<p>Submission to the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The Joint Chamber of Commerce submits to the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department, stating: "The submission is for the matter of submission. It is reported that a public letter from the Shopping Mall Joint Association attached to the Zhejiang Provincial National Products Exhibition Hall stated, (omitted)... The meeting found that all undertakings promoted and encouraged by the government are exempt from various donations and taxes. Moreover, the National Products Exhibition Hall is a government-run enterprise and is not subject to taxation. How can we bear to destroy the business of the sluggish shopping mall with this mere tax, violating the original purpose of government promotion? Thinking about it quietly, the Business Tax Bureau will never have such a cruel heart. Therefore, we specially appeal to your department to examine and approve the order to the Business Tax Bureau to exempt the shopping mall from business tax, so as to promote and benefit national products. This is for the public good."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua Steamer Damaged in Collision</h3>
<p>Due to Beikang Steamer Chasing Yuehang in the Baihe River</p>
<p>The Tonghua steamer originally sailed the Haizhou Laoyao route. Recently, due to the congestion of combined transportation goods, it was reassigned to a larger ship for navigation. In the North China route, it is currently the winter ice age. The Tonghua has a shallow draft due to its load, so it changed its route to Tianjin. Jiang Changqing, the owner of the Tunan ship, was transferred to Tonghua to familiarize himself with the ship. After arriving in Tianjin and unloading the cargo, Tonghua left Tianjin on the 19th of this month to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, after sailing out of the Baihe River, the Beikang steamer of the Northern Company collided with the Tonghua's hull from behind while traveling forward. This was truly beyond the bounds of reasonable collision at sea.</p>
<p>Report on the Cause: The Tonghua steamer's owner, Jiang Changqing, reported the truth about the collision to the head office, stating: "The Tonghua steamer sailed from Tianjin to the Baihe River on the 19th of this month at 11:18 a.m. It is currently the ice age, and the water level is shallower than usual. While the Tonghua was sailing forward, the Beikang steamer of the Northern Shipping Company also set sail from Tianjin and wanted to overtake the Tonghua from behind. The ship suddenly opened up a special fast speed and rushed forward. When it was close to the Tonghua and about to pass, the Beikang hit the Tonghua's outer hull steel plate and other parts. Fortunately, the Tonghua dodged quickly and did not cause a tragic accident."</p>
<p>Demand for Compensation: After receiving the report from Captain Jiang and sending personnel to the Tonghua steamer to inspect the damage, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a letter to the Northern Company, stating that the Beikang steamer was chasing the ship ahead on the same route in the Baihe River during the shallow water ice age, increasing its speed, making it impossible for the Tonghua to prevent or avoid the collision, which was a violation of navigation regulations and caused the accident. All repair losses to the Tonghua steamer caused by the Beikang collision should be the full responsibility of the Beikang steamer. While sending a letter, the company also had the damaged parts repaired so that it could sail to Nanhua.</p>

<h3>Joint Chamber of Commerce Requests Enactment of Regulations to Punish Traitorous Merchants</h3>
<p>Severely Punish Those Who Collude With Foreigners to Deceive Society</p>
<p>Regulations on Country of Origin Labeling Should Be Implemented Early</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Products Factory Joint Association recently received a report from the Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association regarding the discovery of "headless" counterfeit light bulbs and requested that measures be taken to stop them. The association specially submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "The submission is for the matter of 'headless' light bulbs being imported by taking advantage of loopholes, requesting that they be taxed as finished products and that regulations to punish traitorous merchants be swiftly enacted to achieve practical results.' It is found that the dumping of Japanese goods in the domestic market is becoming more and more serious. Our country is the first to bear the brunt, and industry and commerce are suffering the most. The association submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on February 12 of last year, clearly stating the situation of Japanese goods being dumped and requesting that Japanese light bulbs be taxed as dumping goods. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a secret telegram No. 16348, ordering the Committee for the Review of Dumped Goods to deliberate and respond, based on which to review and handle the matter. Unexpectedly, the Japanese are cunning. Before our country has implemented the collection of dumping tax on Japanese light bulbs, they have changed their methods and used their cunning to import light bulbs without copper heads, pretending to be raw materials, reducing costs, and encroaching on the market. From this, it can be inferred that there are rumors that Japanese goods are being transported and unloaded in the leased territories within their sphere of influence, colluding with traitorous merchants, selling under fake brands, and evading customs duties. Such facts have traces to be found, and the harm is not limited to the light bulb industry. In the humble opinion of the association, in addition to ordering all customs offices to tax light bulbs without copper heads as finished products or semi-finished products and strictly ordering secret investigations into smuggling and tax evasion, the regulations on country of origin labeling should be implemented early. At the same time, regulations to punish traitorous merchants should be enacted separately. Any Chinese merchant who colludes with foreign merchants to engage in various improper transactions, disrupts the domestic market, directly affects national tax revenue, endangers national products, indirectly deceives society, and weakens national strength should be severely punished if there is concrete evidence. In this way, even if the country's military force is not enough to resist strong neighbors, punishing traitorous merchants will not be difficult. Punishing one will serve as a warning to others, and we will achieve the practical effect of drawing firewood from under the cauldron. Whether it is appropriate, the letter from the Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association is hereby submitted to your department for examination and implementation. Both national treasury revenue and the future of national products will benefit from this. We earnestly submit this with respect." At the same time, the association also submitted a request to the National Tariff Committee to levy tax on headless light bulbs at the rate of finished products.</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association</h3>
<p>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Unequal Tax Revenue Between Chinese and Foreign Companies</p>
<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association held a supplementary general meeting of members at the Central Western Restaurant auditorium on Four Horse Road. A total of 28 members attended, four of whom were representatives without formal letters, so the meeting was changed to a discussion meeting. The temporary chairman, Wu Tingsheng, opened the meeting as usual. First, the chairman reported on the process of the Ministry of Finance agreeing to allocate 300,000 yuan for the development of the tobacco industry, briefly stating that Chinese merchants have weak capital and are often subjected to economic oppression by foreign merchants, so they requested the government to allocate 500,000 yuan from tax revenue to develop their businesses. Later, Mr. Wu and Mr. Shen Bao represented the association in petitioning, and Minister of Finance Kong agreed to allocate 300,000 yuan. Then, the issue of safekeeping was discussed. Since this fund is a subsidy for Chinese merchants, it should naturally be kept by Chinese merchants. Next, Mr. Huang Ziping gave a speech on how the government's change in tax collection methods has affected business, briefly stating that according to the Unified Tax Gazette and the Tax Gazette, when the three-level tax was implemented, British-American Tobacco Company sold 30,472 boxes per month, totaling 2,417,403,822 yuan, while Chinese merchants sold 68,422 boxes, totaling 2,006,252,647 yuan. Since the change to the two-level tax, British-American Tobacco Company has sold 48,808 boxes per month, totaling 2,726,392,522 yuan, while Chinese merchants have sold 44,323 boxes, totaling 2,554,466,996 yuan. From this, it can be seen that since the change to the two-level tax, Chinese merchants have sold 24,009 boxes less, which is 24,099 fewer boxes of cigarettes, but the tax has increased by 548,214,340 yuan, causing foreign merchants to sell 18,336 more boxes, which is 18,336 more boxes of cigarettes, but the tax revenue has only increased by 308,988,700 yuan. The disadvantage of the two-level tax to Chinese merchants is evident, and we should find ways to improve it. Moreover, each time the tax is changed, Chinese merchants sell fewer packages of cigarettes. A table is shown below:</p>
<p>Tax Level   Anhui (Susong)   Hubei (Huanggang)   Zhejiang (Xinchang)   Henan (Champion)   Hubei (Guangshui)   Henan (Junzhou)   Total Annual Sales</p>
<p>Seven Level   12,000 Packages   80,000 Packages   50,000 Packages   30,000 Packages   10,000 Packages   50,000 Packages   390,000 Packages</p>
<p>Three Level   90,000 Packages   50,000 Packages   40,000 Packages   20,000 Packages   30,000 Packages   265,000 Packages</p>
<p>Two Level   40,000 Packages   30,000 Packages   15,000 Packages   15,000 Packages   115,000 Packages</p>
<p>Therefore, each time the tax rules are changed, sales decrease. After Mr. Huang's report, the meeting was changed to the next discussion due to insufficient attendance.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the reporter met with Mr. Huang to discuss the unequal phenomenon of cigarette tax between Chinese and foreign companies. According to him, Chinese merchants have small capital and can only engage in business. The average capital for each box of low-grade cigarettes is 65 yuan, but the current tax is 80 yuan. This tax is calculated as a percentage, which is 120 percent on a value of 100. Foreign merchants have large capital and mostly deal in high-grade cigarettes. The average capital for each box is 220 yuan, but the tax is 80 yuan, which is only 36 percent. We cannot accept this unequal treatment. However, we are not resisting taxation. According to my opinion, whether it is Chinese or foreign merchants, if the tax is 100 percent on a value of 100, the government can increase tax revenue by 60 million yuan per year.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Prompt Dredging of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>And Clearing of Stranded Vessels</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "The submission is for a factual petition. On the 22nd of this month, the Shanghai Inland River Steamer Industry Association, a member of the association, stated in a letter that 'the Suzhou Creek extends west to Xiepu and east to Su and Chang, and is a vital passage for inland river navigation. In recent years, due to the increasing silting, when the tide recedes, the number of ships traveling to and from is too large, and they are all stranded on the silt, unable to sail. Although the tide has risen greatly recently, as the end of the old year is approaching, the goods from the countryside coming to Shanghai for sale are extremely crowded, and the American wheat ordered by the flour mills is also being imported one after another, and are being transported to the mills for use. These ships are very large, resulting in congestion. The regular ships from Suzhou and Wuxi belonging to our companies are therefore blocked in the area of ​​Sampan Factory Bridge and Yidaikou, unable to approach the wharf. They have been congested since the 11th of this month, and have been suspended for eight days. Although the past two days have been high tides, the ships jammed still could not be cleared completely. In the winter season of low tides and small tides, if we do not request the authorities to take measures to provide relief, not only will water traffic be completely cut off, but also the suspension of our company's ships will result in great losses to our business. In desperation, we request your association to promptly forward the matter to the authorities and take measures to clear the congestion in order to maintain business and facilitate navigation.' Based on this, the association sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation, and verified that the facts were completely consistent with the above. It was also found that ship congestion is of great importance to water security. If measures are not taken quickly to clear the congestion, not only will the steamer industry be affected, but all industries will suffer its impact, and water security will also be greatly disrupted. Based on the above situation, we urgently prepare a letter and forward it to your association, requesting you to promptly forward it to the Public Security Bureau of the Municipal Government, and take measures to provide relief in order to maintain security and facilitate transportation." Based on this, the Suzhou Creek is the only important waterway for inland river navigation. Recently, due to increasing silting, when the river tide recedes, many ships traveling to and from are stranded in the area of Sampan Factory Bridge and Yidaikou, which not only hinders</p>
<p>Communication also accumulates goods, making it necessary to dredge them as soon as possible. In accordance with the facts, we hereby submit a request, asking your government to examine and approve it, and order the competent bureau to estimate the work and start dredging immediately. At the same time, order the Public Security Bureau to order the water patrol team to find ways to clear the ships that accumulate every day, so as to maintain water security and benefit travelers. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>
<h3>Request for Private Airlines to Participate in Intermodal Transport Submitted for Review and Approval</h3>
<p>Can Be Submitted to the Ministry in One Week</p>
<p>The Implementation Period for Participation Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>The Municipal Aviation Association Is Actively Handling the Matter</p>
<p>Private shipping companies' participation in water-land intermodal transport has been decided by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. The shipping bureaus must first open their ships, wharves, routes, etc., and report them to the ministry, and then the ministry will review and approve them. The Shipping Association is actively preparing for this matter. The latest news is checked as follows:</p>
<p>Proposed Rush: Since the Municipal Shipping Association has been fighting for the participation of private shipping companies in intermodal transportation, it is now gradually showing signs of success. However, in view of the fact that China Merchants Group has recently been actively conducting intermodal transportation matters with the Ministry of Railways on routes other than the Longhai Railway, and private companies have not yet achieved their participation goal, the Municipal Shipping Association specially convened representatives of shipping companies on the 11th of this month to discuss urgent measures. As a result, it was decided that the first step would be to submit all private airlines to the ministry and request that they be included in intermodal transportation.</p>
<p>Submission Format: The Municipal Shipping Association specially drafted a form and distributed it to private shipping companies, ordering them to fill it out as soon as possible so that they could be submitted to the ministry for review. The submission format is as follows: The submitter is a private shipping company. Now, I would like to participate in water-land intermodal transportation. I hereby list the items that should be opened for your review. They are: (1) Company name, (2) Location of the head office and branches, (3) All ships, listed by ship name, total tonnage, and route, (4) Wharf police station, (5) Approval to allow XX ship to regularly travel on XX route and conduct intermodal transportation with XX railway, (6) Willing to join the private-state-run water-land intermodal transportation office and share its expenses in proportion to the tonnage of goods transported. This submission is respectfully submitted to XX Department. The submitter's name and the person in charge's name.</p>
<p>Urgent Filling and Reporting: The Municipal Shipping Association is aware that many companies have filled in and submitted the forms according to the table, but there are still those who have not filled them in. Beiyin urgently submitted the forms to the ministry, so it issued an urgent notice to the shipping companies, stating: "In view of the fact that the participation in water-land intermodal transportation was previously decided by the Executive Committee, the submission format was sent to the companies for filling in as early as the 11th of this month. Now that it has been a long time, many members have filled in the submission and sent it to the association, and have urged the association to forward it to the ministry as soon as possible. There are still some who have not filled it in. Now that China Merchants Group is working hard to advance intermodal transportation on various routes, private airlines must not miss the opportunity again. Please make sure that your company submits the submission before the 31st of this month, otherwise it will be regarded as unwilling to join intermodal transportation. The Municipal Shipping Association will forward the ships' tonnage, routes, warehouses, wharves, etc., of the private airline companies that have been filled in and submitted to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways for review and approval. After being approved to participate in intermodal transportation, the companies will form a general agency to undertake intermodal transportation to manage the matter. It is estimated that the submission can be forwarded to the ministry for review in one week."</p>

<h3>Third Day of the National YMCA Convention</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling's Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) was the third day of the 12th National Convention of the Chinese Christian YMCA. In addition to all the group discussions proceeding as usual, the main events were the discussion of the revision of the constitution of the National YMCA Association and Mr. Zhang Boling's speech, the topic of which was "Cooperative Nation Building." He said, in brief, that cooperation is the key to nation building today. The biggest illness of the Chinese nation is selfishness. If the people of the country cannot get rid of the illness of selfishness after being humiliated several times, then the Chinese nation will have no reason to exist in the world. Today, the YMCA can see the source of the illness, prescribe the right medicine, and promote cooperation, which is a gospel for the country. The efficiency of the YMCA's work has always been admired by people across the country. For example, the sports that are so popular today are the result of the promotion of YMCA cadres 30 years ago. If the YMCA can promote cooperation with the spirit of promoting sports, then the nation's illness of selfishness will be cured immediately, and we can wait and see.</p>
<h3>Work Report of the Legal Department of the Public Works Bureau for the Previous Year</h3>
<p>The head of the Legal Department of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession's work report for 1933 stated that the agreement with the courts in the concession was extended on February 8 of that year. Since the establishment of the court three years ago, there have been several difficulties and differences of opinion in the work, but there have been no serious disagreements. The judges and the representatives of the Public Works Bureau are friendly and mutually respectful. Therefore, all differences of opinion have been resolved satisfactorily. During the period of 1933, the criminal section of the court, with the assistance of the Public Works Bureau, was very smooth. There were as many as 33,134 minor and major criminal cases this year, and by the end of the year, only 42 cases remained unresolved, excluding appeals. An average of 89 cases were handled per day, and the number of cases unresolved in one year was less than half a day's work. This speed is rare in other courts. The ratio of the number of sentences to the number of prosecutions this year was 92.5%, which is a high score and shows the effectiveness of the prosecution and the hard work of the police department's investigation and preparation work.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the number of people prosecuted in the First Special District Court and the Jiangsu High Court this year was 128,889 (101,570 in 1932). Among them, 94,625 people committed minor offenses attached to the law and did not appear in court. The bail was confiscated according to regulations. In 1,130 cases, the charges were withdrawn due to insufficient evidence. In addition, a total of 33,134 minor and major criminal cases were concluded (26,217 in the previous year), of which 30,676 people were found guilty and sentenced, and 2,458 people were acquitted. The ratio of those sentenced to the number of prosecutions was 92.5%. Since the establishment of the two laws on April 1, 1930, the total average of this ratio has been 92.3%.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there were also 2,215 private criminal cases, 6,303 cases of violations prosecuted by the health and public affairs departments (3,181 cases in the previous year), and 7,973 cases of violations prosecuted by the motor vehicle section (5,591 cases in the previous year).</p>
<p>Of the appeals filed by the Public Works Bureau, there were 25 this year. In addition, there were 11 appeals from the previous year that were not concluded, for a total of 36. Of the 30 appeals that were tried and concluded, 11 were dismissed, 3 were remanded for retrial, and 16 were given heavier sentences. At the end of the year, there were 6 unresolved appeals, including 2 in the Supreme Court and 4 in the High Court.</p>
<p>Of the 655 appeals filed by the defendants, adding the 119 cases not concluded the previous year, there were a total of 774 cases. Among them, 700 cases were tried and concluded. As a result, 452 were dismissed, 40 were withdrawn, 46 were acquitted, 116 had their sentences reduced, 16 had their sentences increased, 25 were remanded for retrial, 2 were not accepted, 1 was dismissed, and 2 cases were transferred to the city court for trial due to incorrect jurisdiction. There were 74 appeals not concluded at the end of the year, including 59 in the Supreme Court, 14 in the High Court, and 1 in the District Court.</p>
<p>Of the "transferred cases" filed by government offices outside the concession, there were 185 cases involving 352 people. Among them, the evidence was established for 312 people, and they were ordered to be transferred. 14 people were released due to insufficient evidence. 15 people were released on bail pending trial. 1 person was sent to the Japanese authorities. 10 people had their original cases withdrawn.</p>
<p>Unresolved cases: As of December 31, 1933, there were 42 cases in the local and high courts, plus 80 unresolved appeals, for a total of 122 cases. In addition, there were 8 cases where the defendant was in temporary custody.</p>
<p>Probation cases: There were 515 new cases where imprisonment was suspended, and 22 cases where probation was granted on appeal. 91,232 criminal documents were served by the police department, and 7,168</p>
<p>documents were served by judicial police. A total of 117,311 civil documents were served by bailiffs.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Official Repeatedly Receives Extortion Letters</h3>
<p>Received Five Letters in Succession Demanding $5,000</p>
<p>Police Dispatch Detectives to Stake Out and Arrest Criminals</p>
<p>He Weikangpu, styled Zejin, a senior official in the Ministry of Industry, residing at No. 48, Fukang Lane, Xinza Road,</p>
<p>suddenly received a threatening letter from a criminal gang on October 5 last year, containing fierce words and intending to extort $5,000. It also specified a time and place to negotiate payment. After receiving the letter, Ji ignored it. Unexpectedly, the criminal gang sent a letter every two days. By this month, Ji had received five letters in succession, and also made telephone inquiries from time to time. Ji then prepared a reply, stating, "I am not a wealthy family, please do not send any more letters," and handed it over to rickshaw driver Lu San to deliver to the place specified by the criminal gang. In order to avoid trouble, Ji</p>
<p>moved to the Chinese district, No. 2, Lane 2, Xin Village, Yanan Road and Connaught Road, a few days ago. Unexpectedly, the criminal gang was well-informed, and on the 23rd of this month,</p>
<p>Ji received another threatening letter, demanding $5,000 and ordering that the money be sent to the wastepaper basket on the bamboo fence behind the public toilet on Changping Road between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. on the 24th. If he did not comply, danger would ensue. At this point, Ji had no choice but to report the letter to the chief inspector's office of the General Police Station, which informed the Gordon Road Police Station in charge. The police chief immediately ordered detectives to investigate the matter that night. They saw a bamboo</p>
<p>fence</p>
<p>without a wastepaper basket. Until yesterday morning, Chinese detectives Zhu</p>
<p>Hanbo and Cai Liu, Western detective Moore, and Chinese detective Zhao Qingkui, as well as private detectives, all disguised themselves at 8:30 a.m., some as rickshaw pullers with rickshaws in hand, some as vendors with shoulder poles, and secretly waited near the toilet. They saw a wastepaper basket hanging on the bamboo fence. Ji Kangpu sent rickshaw driver Lu San as a representative to put a paper package disguised as $5,000 in banknotes into</p>
<p>the wastepaper basket. Until 11:00,</p>
<p>A Criminal Gang Appears: Xu Alin from Tongzhou, Chen Asan from Chongming, and Zhu Zhangming from Pudong. Xu rode a bicycle to the destination on Changping Road and handed the bicycle over to Zhu for safekeeping. Xu and Chen walked to the back of the toilet and carefully checked the wastepaper basket. Seeing that the paper package was there, Chen pretended to urinate, and Xu touched the paper package and hid it on his person. At that time, the detectives who had been waiting for a long time had witnessed the actions of these people. At this point, they gave a secret signal, and the ambush detectives came out together and arrested Xu and the other two, along with the paper package and bicycle, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian, in addition to prosecuting the three defendants under Article 370 of the Criminal Code for</p>
<p>extortion and attempted fraud, and Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, also stated the circumstances of the case. He said that the victim, Ji Kangpu, had moved to the Chinese district a few days ago, but the criminal gang had learned of Ji's address, and Ji had received a call from the criminal gang yesterday morning, which was quite surprising, because Ji had only moved recently, and the phone was newly installed, and Ji's name and address were not on the phone book. It was strange how the criminal gang had learned of it, so the prosecution requested a postponement of the case for investigation. Then, according to the victim, Ji Kangpu, he stated the circumstances of receiving the letters. According to the witness Lu San, after he was ordered to put the paper package into the wastepaper basket yesterday morning, at about 11:00, the defendant Chen Asan came and asked me if I was</p>
<p>sent from the west (because Ji lived in western Shanghai). I replied yes, and asked if I had brought the money. I replied yes. Xu Alin then took the paper package from the wastepaper basket and hid it on his person before being arrested by the detectives. The defendant Zhu Zhangming was holding the bicycle and standing by the side of the road, etc. Questioned, the defendant Xu Alin confessed that the matter was entirely done by Qian Afu, who was at large. Because I came to Shanghai from Suzhou on the second day of the lunar month and met Qian behind Carter Road and Baker Road, I was invited to Qian's house on Matt Hirst Road. Qian suddenly said that he had a classmate who was quite wealthy, and he had written a letter instructing me and Chen Asan to go and get the money. On the 23rd night, Qian led us to Changping Road to identify the address, and I went home to sleep. Qian hung up the wastepaper basket, and yesterday morning I went to Qian's house. A friend of Qian's, someone A, arrived on a bicycle, so I switched to riding it and went to Changping Road with Chen Asan. I saw Zhu Zhangming passing by and asked Zhu to take care of the bicycle temporarily, and took the paper package and was arrested. Qian and others were standing in the nearby fields, etc. Chen Asan confessed to going with Xu to get the money, but said he did not know about the threatening letters. Zhu Zhangming's confession was evasive. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained for another seven days for questioning.</p>

<p>Three Yuan Per Prostitute Per Month to Be Borne by Brothels</p>
<p>The French Consul General in Shanghai, in order to rectify the issue of brothels in the concession keeping prostitutes with infectious diseases, amended Article 7 of the Public Works Bureau's regulations on the management of brothels and promulgated it for implementation. The method is to order each brothel to be subject to medical examination by a doctor, and to be examined every half month thereafter. The examination fee is 1.5 yuan per prostitute per examination, which should be borne by the brothel owner.</p>
<h3>Gang Fight Between Robbers and Police in the Countryside of Houjia Lane, Haige Road</h3>
<p>Both Sides Battled on Barren Land for a Long Time</p>
<p>A Chinese Policeman Shot and Wounded in the Arm Still Fought Back</p>
<p>|Two Wounded Robbers Detained in Hospital One After Another|</p>
<p>At around 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a gunfight between robbers and police occurred at the intersection of Haige Road, Houjia Lane, the Chinese district, the Public Concession, and the French Concession. As a result, one robber was captured on the spot, one robber was detained in the hospital, one robber escaped, and one Chinese policeman was shot and wounded. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Brothers Diligently and Frugally Manage Their Household: Houjia Lane (i.e., Third Embankment Lane 5) opposite the Chinese Funeral Parlor on Haige Road in western Shanghai is located at the intersection of the Chinese and Concession districts. It is a remote and sparsely populated area with only a dozen villagers living in separate households. Wang Maozi and Wang Shudong are brothers who work as farmers. They are diligent and frugal in managing their household. Although the property inherited from their ancestors is very small, they can make ends meet by saving on expenses. In recent years, they have accumulated some savings. At the same time, because of the busy farming, the two brothers were unable to take care of everything, so they hired a farm worker to help. Unexpectedly, they were coveted by bandits.</p>
<p>Bandits Suddenly Arrived in the Middle of the Night: At around 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning, when the Wang brothers and the farm worker Xiao Di were all asleep, several bandits suddenly came to the outside of the Wang brothers' house and pried open the door. One of the bandits used a flashlight to shine inward to scout. At that time, the farm worker Xiao Di happened to wake up to go to the toilet. The bandits heard the sound and were very happy. They hid on both sides of the door and waited for Xiao Di to come out. They rushed up together, forbade him to make a sound, and forced him to lead them inside to search each room. The Maozi brothers were also awakened, and because they could not resist, they let them do as they pleased. The bandits were very disappointed that the Wang brothers had nothing of value, so they quickly rolled up some better clothes and fled outside.</p>
<p>Calling for Help from All Sides: After the bandits walked out of the door, the Wang brothers and the farm worker Xiao Di shouted to catch the robbers. At the same time, the neighbors also heard the alarm and responded. The bandits saw that things were not going well and planned to flee west. At that time, police officers No. 2480 and No. 3002 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station happened to be passing by. They heard the alarm and saw black shadows running wildly in front of them. They knew that they were not good people, so they used flashlights to investigate and chased after them. The bandits saw the police officers</p>
<p>chasing closely behind and opened fire backwards in desperation.</p>
<p>Chinese Policeman Shot and Wounded: Therefore, the two police officers also returned fire. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle on this barren land for a long time. Chinese police officer No. 3002 was shot in the right arm, but he did not flinch and continued to fight. Before long, two black shadows fell to the ground, and at the same time, the bandits' gunshots stopped. The police officers knew that they had been injured, so they rushed forward to arrest them, but they had already disappeared. It turned out that the bandits had escaped. Police officer No. 2480 quickly sent the injured police officer No. 3002 to the police hospital for treatment and reported to the police station to pursue the escaped wounded bandits.</p>
<p>Wounded Robber Voluntarily Went to the Hospital: After receiving the report, the police station dispatched telegrams to various police authorities, asking them to pay attention. At the same time, they notified all hospitals in the city to pay special attention to patients with gunshot wounds. As expected, at around 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a man suddenly came to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road and requested treatment for a gunshot wound on his leg. After the hospital made detailed inquiries, it was said that his name was Hu</p>
<p>Rongsheng, 24 years old, from Shandong, and lived on Tailasite Road in the French Concession. When asked why he was injured, he was vague. The hospital suspected him</p>
<p>and reported it to the police station. The police were dispatched to the hospital and took him to the police hospital. The bullet was removed from his leg, and after examination, it was indeed the bullet fired by the two police officers, No. 3002 and No. 2480. Knowing that he was the bandit they were searching for, they immediately placed him under surveillance.</p>
<p>Another Escaped Bandit Captured: Not long after, the police station suddenly received a call from the French police station, saying that there was a man with a gunshot wound in the abdomen at Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road. He was seeking treatment at the hospital with evasive language and had been detained by the police station. After receiving the report, the Public Concession Police Station rushed to bring the man back and sent him to the police hospital for treatment. After examination by the hospital doctor, it was found that he was also the escaped bandit, so he was also placed under surveillance. When asked his name, he said that his name was Xu Wenzhuo, 22 years old, and lived on Taoerfeisi Road in the French Concession. He also confessed that he had gone to rob and opened fire to resist arrest. There were a total of three bandits who went with him that day. Therefore, the police station is still strictly pursuing the escaped bandit. As of the time the reporter drafted the manuscript, it was learned that a clue had been obtained.</p>
<h3>Inland River Thaws, Ships Resume Navigation</h3>
<p>But Due to the Cold Weather, Travel is Slightly Slower Than Before</p>
<p>Wusong River Blocked, Changed Course</p>
<p>After heavy snow in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the inland river shipping was interrupted due to the freezing of the waterways. In addition, the siltation of the Suzhou River became increasingly serious, blocking the ships. Now, all inland river ships have completely resumed navigation. However, ships in Wuxi, Qingpu, and other places have changed course to the South Huangpu River. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Thawing and Resumption of Navigation: Merchant Shipping, Ning Shao, Gong Mao, Xie Xing, Tai Dong, Yuan Tong, Rui Shengxiang, Li Xing, and other inland river shipping companies operating ships on the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Huzhou, Shanghai-Wuxi, Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Zhangjiagang, Shanghai-Qingpu, and other routes. Previously, due to heavy snow in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the waterways were frozen, causing ships to Qingpu, Changshu, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places to stop sailing. Ships to Hangzhou, Huzhou, and other places were delayed each time. After the ships tried to break the ice and with continuous sunny days, the waterways thawed, and inland river ships in all places have completely resumed navigation. However, due to the cold weather, travel is slightly slower than usual.</p>
<p>Changing Course: As for the Wusong River, due to the increasing siltation, as the lunar New Year is approaching, ships from various villages are sailing to Shanghai to purchase</p>
<p>goods or sell goods, which is very crowded, causing ships at the Shanban Factory Bridge and other places to be congested. Ships sailing to Shanghai-Wuxi and Shanghai-Qingpu are changing course to the South Huangpu River each time they set sail. However, the journey is about 100 li longer than the original route, so they must arrive late, causing the schedule to be disrupted. It is reported that the trade association has requested that measures be taken to dredge the river to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Report on the Embezzlement Case of Over 80,000 at the Consolidated Tax Bureau to the Ministry of Finance: Discovery Process</h3>
<p>Subordinate Staff Deng Darong's Account of the Origin of the Embezzlement</p>
<p>Bureau Chief Wang Zongzhu Voluntarily Requests Punishment for Negligence</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Deng Darong, a second-class staff member of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau in this city, forged the Bureau Chief's seal and fraudulently obtained over 80,000 yuan in tax funds from the Central Bank. This was discovered at the end of last year during the year-end settlement. The Bureau had already detained Deng and sent him to the local court for interrogation, as previously reported. Bureau Chief Wang Zongzhu, considering the seriousness of the matter, yesterday submitted a detailed report of the incident</p>
<p>to the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Affairs Department, requesting review. The original text obtained is as follows: (Omitted above) Upon investigation, the tax funds collected by the various inspection offices under this Bureau were previously remitted to the Bureau in cash, or transferred to the Bureau through banks for verification and receipt, and were uniformly deposited in the Bank of Communications for safekeeping and remittance. Since April of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), after the implementation of the "Regulations for the Central Bank to Manage the Collection and Remittance of Consolidated Taxes" as ordered by the former Consolidated Tax Department, or through other entrusted commercial firms,</p>
<p>funds were transferred to the Shanghai Head Office. Each month, a document was falsely submitted to the Bureau for inclusion in the receipts. However, at that time, the Central Bank only had a consolidated tax account and no account for this Bureau. In August of the same year, an order was received from the Department, through a notification from the Central Bank Business Bureau, stating that the tax funds remitted by the inspection offices were part of this Bureau's income. Although the offices were directly remitting funds to the Central Bank Business Bureau in accordance with the regulations, according to the supervisory system, the Bureau should still</p>
<p>review and include the amount in the accounts</p>
<p>and submit a supplementary document for verification in order to correct the accounting. The Bureau immediately reported this to the former Consolidated Tax Department, which approved a letter to the Central Bank Business Bureau, referring to the method of the Shandong-Henan Consolidated Tax Bureau, to open a separate account for this Bureau. All tax funds remitted by the offices under the Bureau's jurisdiction should first be included in this Bureau's account, and then transferred to the Department by the Bureau issuing checks. Consequently, on September 23 of the same year, two signed seals were sent to the Central Bank Business Bureau for record. This was the beginning of the establishment of an account for this Bureau's tax funds in the Central Bank. According to the "Regulations for the Central Bank to Manage the Collection and Remittance of Funds for the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Department,"</p>
<p>Article 10 stated: "The seal for withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Tax Department shall be signed and issued by the Consolidated Tax Department and the local consolidated tax bureaus or inspection offices. All checks shall also be kept separately. Furthermore, the checks of each bureau or office shall only be signed and used when remitting funds on the 25th of each month. No checks may be signed or withdrawn in addition to what is specified.” Therefore, when this Bureau remitted these tax funds each month, the checks issued by the bases specified "Pay to the order of" followed by "Tax Affairs Department" on the check, and the words "or bearer" were crossed out, indicating that the amount of the check was specifically for transferring funds to the Tax Affairs Department account. The checks were</p>
<p>personally signed</p>
<p>and stamped with the ivory seal bearing the two characters "Zong Zhu". This ivory seal was specifically for signing checks for remitting funds. Now, upon investigation, Deng Darong, an auditor in the First Section of this Bureau, has been responsible for handling the remittance of various tax funds and auditing the remittance affairs of various branch offices. The disposition and regulations have been established accordingly. Therefore, the number of remittances submitted to the Bureau by the various inspection offices and the number listed in the Bureau's Central Bank account are all audited by this staff member. When this Bureau prepares a document at the end of the month to remit funds to the Department, the cashier also sends the check to this staff member for checking, filling in the details, and returning it for signing and remittance to the Department. This staff member rarely took leave, except for a few days of sick leave before the New Year holiday. On the 4th of the month, he had not yet returned from leave. On that day, the Nanjing Inspection Office submitted the December wheat flour tax. Because the staff member was on leave, the remittance document and attachments were received by the cashier. The cashier, noting that the remittance was for the December wheat flour tax, checked the records and found that the Nanjing Inspection Office had only remitted wheat flour tax up to October. The cashier inquired why the Central Bank had not yet listed the November tax, and after an investigation, it was discovered that the bank had already listed the November tax, but this Bureau's records did not include this amount, indicating an apparent irregularity. Upon further inquiry, it was learned that someone had repeatedly withdrawn cash from the Central Bank, and the Central Bank provided the cash withdrawal checks for review. The seal and signature</p>
<p>did not match.</p>
<p>It was determined that someone had fraudulently withdrawn the funds. Upon examining the back of the check, it was discovered to be stamped with the "Duan Ji" seal and a receipt stamp from the Shanghai China Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Furthermore, it was discovered that Deng Darong had issued checks under the name of "Duan Ji" from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which had been seen by the Bureau's staff. The fraudulent signature was clearly the work of this staff member. Subsequently, it was discovered that this staff member had secretly gone to Guangdong during his leave and returned to Shanghai on the Empress of Asia ship on the 6th of this month. Therefore, people were secretly dispatched to wait and bring him in for questioning. The staff member was immediately dismissed and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for custody. A report was made to the Tax Affairs Department, and auditors Chen Jun and Lü Chunming were dispatched to the Bureau to jointly open the staff member's official iron cabinet and the drawers of his residence. A forged stone seal and Central Bank checkbook, deposit slips, and other items were found. In addition, three remittance documents from the Hangzhou Inspection Office and two from the Changzhou</p>
<p>Inspection Office, as well as one remittance document from the Nanjing Inspection Office, totaling six documents, were found unfiled. A batch of Central Bank Business Bureau receipts and payment notices were also concealed and seized. As for this Bureau's account at the Central Bank,</p>
<p>according to regulations, the Bureau could only issue checks for</p>
<p>transferring funds to the Department and could not withdraw cash. Furthermore, the only deposits</p>
<p>were remittances from various inspection offices, and no cash deposits were made. The staff member's duty was only to audit the amounts. However, in the staff member's iron cabinet and drawers, a forged seal, check stubs, and deposit slips were found. When questioned about where the seal and checks came from, how he was able to withdraw cash from the Central Bank, and how he delivered the cash, he claimed: "In April of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), due to a temporary need, I planned to secretly withdraw tax funds from the Central Bank. I secretly carved a Bureau Chief's seal in advance. When filling out checks for remitting funds, I secretly stole the check receipt form from the checkbook and fraudulently obtained a checkbook from the Central Bank. I filled out two checks, stamped them with the secretly carved seal, and withdrew cash from the Central Bank. The Central Bank initially</p>
<p>refused to pay because the seal did not match.</p>
<p>I then signed two more checks, still using the secretly carved seal, and sent a letter to the Central Bank in the name of the Bureau Chief, requesting payment. This letter was also stamped with the secretly carved seal, and the Central Bank then paid. From then on, I obtained a Central Bank checkbook for this Bureau's account. I continued to use the secretly carved seal to fraudulently obtain cash from the Central Bank. Later, fearing that this would be discovered during the mid-year settlement in June, I devised methods to cover it up. Because the Bureau's remittances are required to be completed in full each month, and the various inspection offices are located at different distances, it often takes almost a month to complete the full remittance. At that time, the next month's tax funds from the inspection offices near Shanghai may also be remitted. Therefore, I delayed sending the remittance documents from the offices near Shanghai to the cashier, so that the cashier's daily report could not include them, and the accounting department also</p>
<p>could not record them.</p>
<p>In this way, although the funds had arrived at the bank and the documents had arrived at the Bureau, the cashier, accounting, and auditing departments of this Bureau had no way of knowing. I was then able to move funds from the future to cover for the past. During the account reconciliation in June and at the end of the year (i.e., semi-annual), if there were discrepancies in the amounts, I would fraudulently withdraw more funds or return some cash to the Central Bank to ensure that the bank's deposit balance matched the amount listed in the Bureau's account for the half-year settlement, preventing the Bureau's departments from discovering it. As for the amount overdrawn, because it has been a long time, I cannot remember. I know that this is a capital crime, and I only ask for leniency." Upon examining the situation, the ingenuity of the scheme and the skill of the cover-up are beyond the expectations of ordinary people. The Bureau Chief believes that, according to regulations, this account at the Central Bank can only be transferred for remittance and cannot be withdrawn</p>
<p>in cash. I never expected that this staff member would dare to forge a seal and fraudulently obtain funds.</p>
<p>It is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>As for the amount overdrawn, we will discuss with the Central Bank and request that the account statements of this Bureau from the opening of the account to the end of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) be copied and sent to us. We will then compare them in detail with the Bureau's general ledger. It is estimated that a total of 84,348.28 yuan in taxes was fraudulently obtained. Furthermore, the staff member returned 27.07 yuan to the Central Bank, so the actual amount fraudulently withdrawn was 84,321.21 yuan. According to the records, the Hangzhou Inspection Office remitted 154.70 yuan for the November wheat flour tax in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Furthermore, the Hangzhou Inspection Office remitted 13,457.43 yuan for the same month's cotton yarn tax, and the Hangzhou Inspection Office remitted 25,500 yuan for the same month's match tax. Furthermore, the Changzhou Inspection Office remitted 3,211.27 yuan for the same month's wheat flour tax, and the Changzhou Inspection Office remitted 31,771.22 yuan for the same month's cotton yarn tax. Furthermore, the Nanjing Inspection Office remitted 10,226.59 yuan for the same month's wheat tax, totaling 84,321.21 yuan,</p>
<p>which precisely matches the amount of the staff member's fraudulent withdrawal from the Central Bank. This is the result of the investigation of the staff member's forgery of the seal and</p>
<p>fraudulent obtainment of tax funds.</p>
<p>In summary, the staff member fraudulently obtained 84,321.21 yuan in taxes. When he was detained, he turned over 212 yuan in Shanghai banknotes and 750 yuan in Hong Kong banknotes. Furthermore, it was discovered that the staff member had accounts under the name of "Duan Ji" at the Shanghai China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which could be recovered for a total of 13,001.20 yuan. The remaining amount is 71,358.01 yuan. The staff member's forgery of the seal and fraudulent withdrawal of tax funds are confirmed by evidence and testimony. He has disregarded the law and should be severely punished to serve as a warning. The Bureau Chief's improper use of personnel and failure to detect the crime is inexcusable and should be subject to strict disciplinary action.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned situation of this case was first submitted by the Bureau Chief to the Minister of Finance for review. The Minister instructed that the staff member be transferred to the court for interrogation and prosecution. Following this instruction, on the 15th of this month, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, requesting that the staff member be transferred to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court for interrogation. In addition to dispatching personnel to the First Special District Local Court to file a lawsuit and attach a civil suit with various evidence, and to report the court's interrogation situation at any time after the prosecution, a document is submitted to request review of the case of Deng Darong, a staff member of this Bureau, forging a seal and fraudulently obtaining tax funds from the bank, and the process of transferring him to the court for interrogation in accordance with the instruction. In addition to submitting this to the Minister of Finance, this is respectfully submitted to the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo Exhibits Two-Headed Snake</h3>
<p>Obtained by Physician Wang Chang of Suqian</p>
<p>Two Heads, One Body, Approximately One Zhang Long</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo began exhibiting a two-headed snake yesterday. It was captured by physician Wang Jing of Suqian. It has two heads, one body, and is approximately one zhang in length. Its entire body is light yellow, interspersed with black markings. Its two eyes are bright and piercing, and its appearance is quite frightening. The exhibition is said to last for one month, after which Mr. Wang will take it back.</p>
<h3>Low Water Levels in the Yangtze River: Strict Precautions Against Banditry on Salt Barges</h3>
<p>Upper Yangtze Shallow Water Fees Increased by 50%</p>
<p>Since the Yangtze River's upstream water level has dropped significantly, the river's water is only five chi deep. Ships traveling to Hunan have all been forced to stop, and goods are being transferred to barges. The Hongzhen and Hongting, two vessels of the Sanbei Company, were transporting salt into Hunan on this trip. They should have already arrived since departing from Hankou. However, yesterday, the Shashi Branch sent a telegram stating that the Hongzhen and Hongheng ships had not yet arrived. The Juyan Salt Warehouse is very anxious about this. During periods of shallow water, riverboats are often stopped, and bandits in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, due to the central government's blockade, lack salt and pay special attention to salt transport ships. If they are stranded for a long time, there is a risk of banditry. The Shashi Branch of the Juyan Salt Warehouse should quickly dispatch barges to transport the salt from the Hongzhen and Hongheng ships as soon as possible to avoid danger. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company ordered the Hankou Branch to quickly send a tow barge to transport the salt.</p>
<p>The six Shanghai companies' upper Yangtze shallow water fees were originally increased by 30% on the 13th of last month. Because the water level has been falling daily and ship navigation is difficult, it was publicly agreed yesterday that the previous 30% increase would be abolished and replaced with a 50% surcharge based on the fixed price, with the funds being used for operational support.</p>
<h3>Update on the French Municipal Council's Suspension of Rickshaw Licenses</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Merchants Continue to Petition the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>Industry Association Announces Registration</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the French Municipal Council's restriction on rickshaw licenses has resulted in a portion of small-scale rickshaw merchants in the French Concession being unable to obtain January licenses. As a result, over 2,000 rickshaw pullers who rely on this for a living have become unemployed. Rickshaw merchants, in particular, are complaining bitterly and are requesting the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association to find a solution. The Association, fearing that unemployment would lead to trouble, has been holding meetings to discuss countermeasures while also comforting the unemployed rickshaw merchants and pullers, urging them to remain calm and refrain from any rash actions. The Association has also petitioned higher authorities for intervention and has elected representatives to petition the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to appeal to the French authorities in order to achieve the goal of issuing supplementary licenses. Furthermore, in order to comply with Chairman Cheng of the Taxpayers' Association, a detailed report was submitted yesterday to investigate the unemployed rickshaws and conduct registration. The submitted registration form is as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Taxpayers' Association: We are submitting a further petition requesting your review and assistance. The number of operating rickshaws in this city is limited to 10,000 by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement. In the Chinese areas of Nanshi, Beishi, Pudong, and Huxi, the Public Utilities Bureau has set a limit of 10,000. The French Concession, located between the Chinese and British areas, has never had a fixed number of rickshaw licenses. While the British Settlement issues licenses in numbered order up to 10,000, and the Chinese area of Nanshi has 6,014 rickshaws, approximately 5,000 rickshaws supplementally obtain French licenses due to their proximity. Since the January 28th Incident in the past, some rickshaw merchants from Zhabei moved to Nanshi to operate. Furthermore, unlicensed rickshaws in the Caojiadu area of Huxi have been expanded from 600-700 to over 3,100 by the Public Utilities Bureau in the name of reorganization, and the French Concession in Xuhui and Xinhua Districts has been designated as their operating area. More of these rickshaws also obtain French licenses for compensation. As a result, the number of French licenses, which was previously around 5,000 in addition to the Special District, has been increasing daily. In order to maintain traffic, the French authorities have stipulated that, in addition to the 10,000 British licenses, the maximum number is 7,000. This is not a problem during the summer and autumn months, as most rickshaw pullers return to their hometowns to farm. However, during the cold winter months, many impoverished laborers and bankrupt farmers from northern Jiangsu come to Shanghai, and there are even more people who rely on pulling rickshaws for a living. This creates a shortage of the 7,000 rickshaw licenses. Therefore, all 7,000 rickshaw licenses for November and December of last year were eagerly snatched up within three to five days. This year, the French authorities stipulated that old licenses from December 1933 would be exchanged for new licenses for January 1934. Furthermore, starting this month, all those with January rickshaw licenses have been ordered to provide a guarantor and pay the fees. However, rickshaw merchants have had French licenses for 300-400 rickshaws, and now they have suddenly been suspended, resulting in approximately 2,000-3,000 pullers sharing five or six rickshaws losing their livelihoods. The rickshaw merchants are suffering losses because their empty rickshaws parked outside their doors are subject to police intervention. Therefore, the losses suffered by rickshaw merchants over the past two months are countless. In the past, merchants still naively hoped that the French authorities would take care of the rickshaw owners who have been paying operating fees for many years. However, after two months, this hope has been dashed. Thousands of rickshaw pullers have lost their homes due to the suspension of business, and dozens of small businesses, on which more than a thousand people depend for food and clothing, are in constant anxiety. If a solution is not found soon, it will be related to social order and the livelihoods of the poor. Therefore, we are submitting a detailed report of the situation, as well as a copy of the registration form, and respectfully request your association to forward it to the French Municipal Council, to review the donation records and provide remedies to save the livelihoods of the poor and maintain social stability. The merchants will be extremely grateful and will wait for your instructions. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession. The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association, Rickshaw Merchant Representatives Li Pingyu, Yu Shanjiang, Jiang Heshang, Chen Changsheng, Liu Qikuan, Zhou Jungong, Zhang Zhengkui, Li Wanzhang, and others, jointly submitted on January 24, 23rd year of the Republic (1934).</p>
<p>Investigation and Registration: The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association is investigating and registering the names of those whose rickshaw licenses have been suspended by the French authorities: Chen Changsheng 17, Yu Shanjiang 7, Xu Huangfu 10, Zhu Qiyuan 2, Fan Youkuan 5, Chen Yousi 1, Xu Kaiyou 2, Zhu Baohuan 6, Li Pingyu 40, Wang Dengcai 6, Li Helong 1, Liu Dasan 1, Xu Xiangji 2, Wang Bixi 4, Xiong Chunhua 4, Ju Ganxin 17, Liu Changjiang 8, Liu Zhengyin 5, Chen Fujiang 11, Zhang Gui 3, Liu Guang'an 1, Cao Asan 1, Xu Shurong 1, Yuan Dehua 1, Wang Huaiyi 1, Lü Xiushan 7, Ma Chunhong 2, Zhou Jungong 9, Zhang Zhengkui 3, Wu Jixiang 6, Wu Chongyin 1, Jiang Ruiliang 12, Tian Jingen 2, Wang Fengyou 2, Ma Chengfang 4, An Genlin 16, Chen Jinshan 7, Li Zhiliang 40, Su Genlin 3, Gu Changsheng 3, Sun Zhaofang 1, Zhang Huailin 2, Chen Shouchang 9, Wang Taikang 5, Zhao Yougao 4, Chen Guolin 1, Xie Zhengfang 1, Li Wanzhang 1, Chen Xin 10, Zhu Qiming 1, Wu Wanqing 1, Jiang Jianqun 9, Shen Yousheng 3, Liu Qikuan 24. The above total is 346 vehicles, with the majority owning only one vehicle.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Tax Exemption Cases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Committee recently discussed several requests for tax exemption. One case involved a subordinate temple of a Buddhist temple at 476 Avenue Edward VII, with an estimated annual rental value of 3,600 yuan and a quarterly tax of 126 yuan. The location is a five-bay Chinese-style urban building, with only the upper floor being used for religious purposes. The Committee stated that tax exemptions for temples must be for buildings located in sacred places and not used for other purposes, so the request should not be approved. Another case involved a request for tax exemption for a portion of 0A310 Dongjiaxing Road, which was intended for private worship. The Committee found that the location did not meet the requirements for tax exemption and was also being used for commercial activities, so it also recommended disapproval. Another case involved a dispute over the estimated rental value of 15,600 yuan for a warehouse at 784 and 796 North Suzhou Road. The Committee decided to uphold the original assessment. All of the above cases have been approved by the Board of Directors on Wednesday of this week and will be implemented accordingly.</p>

<h3>Over Three Million Yuan in Profit for Two Railways: Employee Bonuses Issued Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Total of 560,000 Yuan, One Month's Salary per Person</p>
<p>The Two Railways Union Has Understood and There Are No Problems</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Administration had an operating income of over 20 million yuan last year, with a net profit of approximately 3 million yuan. The Administration requested the Ministry of Railways to approve the issuance of bonuses in accordance with the Ministry's "Regulations on Year-End Bonuses for Railway Employees." The Ministry subsequently approved the allocation of 20% of the profits as bonuses for employees, estimated to be approximately one month's salary per person. However, the Two Railways Union believed that last year's profits for the two railways were more than this amount and sent representatives, including Chen Boqun, to petition Director Huang Boqiao, requesting the issuance of two months' salary, etc. However, there was no satisfactory result.

<h3>Annual Report of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander</h3>
<p>1933 Was a Peaceful Year</p>
<p>Construction Started on the Volunteer Corps Headquarters Building</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas, the recently relieved Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, submitted his work report for the past year to the Municipal Council, stating that in March of that year, the various units of the Volunteer Corps were thoroughly inspected by Major General Fleming, Commander of the British Forces in Shanghai. According to his inspection report, the Corps is capable of defending the Settlement and assisting the police</p>
<p>in maintaining order</p>
<p>and security. 1933 was a peaceful year, so the Volunteer Corps was not ordered to mobilize. The Corps members were diligent in their inspection and training, and their efficiency improved daily. However, there is still a need for progress in drills such as unit transfers. As for the firearms used, the number of automatic weapons has been increasing daily. The Corps members have not slackened in their training in this area. However, the number of personnel is insufficient, far from the prescribed number. This is extremely important for the defense of the Settlement. The purpose of the B-level reserve team was to attract veterans to join, but after forming two teams, the number of applicants has been</p>
<p>extremely disappointing.</p>
<p>This must be addressed urgently. Construction has started on the Volunteer Corps headquarters building, and each team will now have a delivery room to facilitate communication. This will be convenient not only during mobilization but also on ordinary days. Furthermore, a manager has been assigned to the shooting range, which has been needed for a long time, greatly benefiting the training of Corps members. The Russian unit has achieved excellent results as before after the commander was assigned. Most of the unit members have been replaced by young people, who are comparable to the old members, and they pay close attention to exercise. The Corps members are healthy and satisfactory. Colonel Thomas expressed his deep gratitude to the Board of Directors for their support and to the various departments of the Municipal Council for their</p>
<p>cooperative spirit.</p>
<p>He was especially proud of the Corps members' service and spirit of sacrifice. Regarding the number of Corps members, the prescribed number for the Chinese unit in the Volunteer Corps is five</p>
<p>officers and 120 members. The current number is seven officers and 164 members, including active duty and A-level reservists, which exceeds the prescribed number.</p>

<h3>Pudong Eggs Accumulate in Large Quantities; International Trade Bureau Plans to Promote Use</h3>
<p>Letter from Chuansha County Government Seeks Solutions</p>
<p>The County Produces Over Three Million Eggs Annually</p>
<p>Pudong has long been famous for its egg production, so farmers generally regard raising chickens as an important side business. The eggs produced are sold in this city. However, due to the economic downturn and commercial stagnation in recent years, sales have been greatly affected, resulting in large-scale accumulation in rural areas. In light of this, the Chuansha County Government has sent a special letter to the International Trade Bureau in this port, requesting assistance in finding outlets and developing sales plans. The original letter roughly stated: This county has 26,557 households, each of which usually raises Pudong laying hens. On average, each household produces 120 eggs per year, totaling 3,864,840 eggs annually. Recently, due to stagnant sales, households' interest in raising chickens has waned, which has also affected the county's chicken-raising promotion plan. The only solution now is to find ways to expand egg sales. We kindly request you to investigate and determine export outlets for this trade, so that farmers' livelihoods can be improved, and so on. After receiving the letter, the International Trade Bureau immediately instructed the Guidance Department to draft a plan and reply.</p>

<h3>Manager and Apprentice Die from Coal Gas Poisoning</h3>
<p>At No. 34 Rongchang Lane, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, Xu Zengfu (age 22, from Nanjing), the manager of the Yicheng Yarn Belt Factory, and his apprentice Zhang Xincai (age 17), along with friends Fan Kaiyou and Ni Baochun, slept in the same room. Yesterday, due to the severe cold, they closed the doors and windows tightly and placed a coal briquette stove in the room for heating. Unexpectedly, after the four fell asleep, the small room was filled with fumes all night, and all of them suffered from coal gas poisoning. When colleagues broke into the room around 7 a.m. the next morning, they saw Xu and the others lying unconscious on the bed. Realizing that they had been poisoned, they rushed them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After the doctors administered injections and medication, Fan and Ni were fortunate enough to recover, but Xu Zengfu and Zhang Xincai died one after another due to excessive poisoning. The bodies were then transported by special vehicle to the coroner's office, pending examination by the court this morning.</p>
<h3>Dancer Sues for Seduction and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Luo Meimei, a dancer from Ningbo at the Vienna Dance Hall, recently hired lawyer Zhou Yongding to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Zou Shunsun, a local resident and owner of the China Woodware Company at No. 660 Jing'an Temple Road, of seducing her into illicit relations and abandoning her. She requested that he be punished according to the law and, in a separate civil suit, demanded a one-time payment of 11,440 yuan for living expenses. Her complaint has already been published in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the trial, but the defendant, Zou Shunsun, did not appear. Lawyer Gu Hanli appeared in court on his behalf and requested a postponement, stating that Zou was currently collecting accounts in Nanjing. The plaintiff, Luo Meimei, appeared with her lawyer, Zhou. Judge Xue Lanru questioned Luo Meimei about her age and place of origin. Because the defendant was absent, the case could not proceed, and the hearing was postponed to the afternoon of the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Apprentice's Tragic Death Case Postponed Pending Examination by the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Shi Shaoxing, an apprentice at the Xufutai Western Tailor Shop on Dalian Bay Road, died suddenly. When the authorities examined the body, a hole was found in the back of his head, with blood flowing freely. The forensic doctor determined that the injury was caused by a sharp pair of scissors before death. However, the shop owner, Xu Futai, and his wife, Ms. Chen, both denied committing the crime, while the deceased's uncle, Shi Qixiang, insisted that he had been brutally murdered by the Xu couple. Lawyer Wu Peng filed a criminal lawsuit against Xu and his wife for cruel murder, requesting the death penalty. This has been reported in this newspaper. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special District Court. The defendants, Xu Futai and his wife, failed to appear despite being summoned. The plaintiff, Shi Qixiang, testified that the deceased was his second nephew. On the night of the 13th of this month, his eldest nephew, Shaozhou, came to report that Shaoxing had died. However, on the night of the 12th, the two brothers had come to his place to borrow money to return to their hometown. On the morning of the 13th, Shaozhou saw him drinking water on the road and borrowed money from Shaozhou to buy snacks. On the morning of the 15th, he went to the coroner's office and suddenly saw blood flowing from the right side of the deceased's head, and his clothes were stained with blood. The blood on the cement floor was also not yet dry. The deceased had often told him that the shop owner and his wife treated him very harshly and often beat him. Therefore, this tragic death must have been a case of murder, and he demanded a strict investigation, and so on. Shi Shaozhou then took the stand and testified that he saw Shaoxing drinking water on the road on the morning of the 13th and gave him money to buy snacks, after which he did not see him again. The deceased had no previous illness, and his mind was normal. At 5 p.m. on the 13th, he suddenly heard the old clerk say that his brother had died. He rushed to Xu Futai's shop and saw his brother's body, which was already stiff, and saw blood near his head, especially a lot of blood at the back of his head, a tragic sight to behold. He immediately rushed to inform his uncle and accompanied him to the coroner's office on the morning of the 15th, and so on. The court had previously instructed the Health Department of the Municipal Council to examine the cause of the injury to the deceased's head, but no report has yet been received. The hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Coal Gas Poisoning Nearly Claims Three Lives</h3>
<p>Chen Liansheng, a Ningbo native living at No. 18 Luoxiang Local House, Hudong District, works in a Yangshupu yarn factory. His hard-earned income is sufficient for food and clothing. His wife, Sun, 25 years old, was due to give birth, and suddenly went into labor a few days ago. He hired a midwife, Ms. He, to assist with the delivery, and also lit a charcoal stove for warmth. Unexpectedly, the house was small and narrow, without doors and windows. Chen Liansheng's sister, Zhu Yuan, entered the room after shopping and saw her sister-in-law lying stiffly on the bed, while the midwife had fainted on the floor, and the baby was also breathless. She then felt the coal gas fumes, which were unbearable. She cried for help loudly. Neighbors gathered, and opinions varied, but no one knew what to do. Fortunately, a neighboring woman was quick-witted and sent someone to inform Liansheng and also called female doctors Qian Shuzhen, Yuan Huiyu, and Xu Cuizhen of the Hongkou People's Maternity Hospital to rush to the rescue. They said it was caused by coal gas poisoning. At that time, the parturient's uterus had also prolapsed, so surgery was performed to restore it to its original position. Fortunately, the poisoning was mild, and the parturient and midwife regained consciousness one after another. The baby was cyanotic all over, and although artificial respiration was used to barely save it, it was in a terrible state.</p>

<p>Reading Problems</p>
<h3>How to Train Our Minds (2)</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Xu Lezhen (continued)</p>
<p>In short: Our attitude toward a person's pursuit of knowledge should be:</p>
<p>(1) For the practical use of life, starting from needs, and strongly denying the attitude of "learning for the sake of learning";</p>
<p>(2) Learning life from life, reading is just a means; cultivating the organization of our minds from life, not relying solely on a certain rationality.</p>
<p>(3) Not creating a perfect person first and then recognizing society, but gradually expanding the boundaries of recognition in the struggle of social life; recognizing the reality of the environment is our most urgent need; but we do not</p>
<p>Can we look at it coldly and be satisfied? What should we do after we know it? We still have to do something!</p>
<p>The above is a superficial contribution to your attitude. Whether it is correct, I hope you and the general readers will correct it. Below, I will answer a few of the questions you asked: (1) The science that can train a person's mind to be rigorous, sound, and sensitive, I think the most appropriate answer is logic, but other sciences such as mathematics and natural sciences also have this effect.</p>
<p>(2) Logic can not only "organize our thoughts" but also correct the misconceptions of common sense. A person who does not understand logic is often trapped in contradictory thinking throughout his life, unable to correctly understand all phenomena. He often mistakenly regards fragments as the whole, showing the ignorance of "fetishism," and he is still complacent, thinking that he has grasped the truth. Therefore, some people call logic the science of methodology. It suggests the correct method of "recognition."</p>
<p>Studying logic does not necessarily require advanced mathematics, but it cannot be separated from "reality." It must be grasped in daily life. A person who has not attended school can also have a very logical mind. It can be seen that there is a certain logic in life, which has already implied everything to those who are loyal to life. This science can only obtain some rules in books; and it is strangely difficult to understand, but a person who has experienced life will naturally understand it as soon as he reads it.</p>
<p>(3) We should study materialist dialectics. But we must also read books on formal logic.</p>
<p>(4) The purpose of reading foreign languages ​​is a means of seeking knowledge or a need for a career. Since you have already self-studied to the ability to read foreign classics, you do not have to give up English in order to study other sciences. You better read some related English works while doing a certain study.</p>
<p>Finally, I still hope that you can propose a more practical and systematic personal reading plan for discussion.</p>

<h3>Taking Advantage of Weaknesses</h3>
<p>— Tian Xiu</p>
<p>Weakness is a person's shortcoming. Whether it is a habitual habit or something done, as long as you show it significantly, you never want to cover it up, but those who are clever discover it, and like magicians, they use it in a set, and it can be taken endlessly and used inexhaustibly. On a small scale, it is a personal way to make money. If applied internationally, it is the only magic weapon for aggression! How can it be said that it is a personal way to make money? Not to mention anything else, take Shanghai as an example. It is said that there are many people who pretend to be Mu Lao (another name for Pak-to-tings), who are strong and loud in their words, and their appearance is the most popular (to be popular is to be good). They also have many errand runners who run for him and listen for him. As long as they encounter opium, gambling, red pills, strips (women), and other illegal and prohibited things, they will try their best to run into that place. Their momentum is fierce and they will first give you a threat. If you buy his account (naturally you have to buy his account), he will immediately change his tone and say that everyone is from the same family, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, so the big things will turn into nothing in a while, but the five or ten yuan bills have been put into their coat pockets.</p>
<p>Looking at culture and art, which magazines, novels, books, dramas, movies, etc. are not using this set of tricks? What they use is nothing more than the two most obvious and common points of sexual desire and superstition. Just pay attention to the advertisements in the daily newspapers to prove it. Look at the dramas performed on the stage, most of which are superstitious about theocracy and vigorously maintain the so-called cause and effect retribution. The films on the screen are marked with legs that are fragrant and no stars that are not naked, with tempting advertisements, plus a ban on selling tickets to children under the age of sixteen to attract general erotic audiences. Novels and books are also depicting the affairs of men and women, and even the social news of the daily newspapers, as long as it involves private affairs between men and women, they are vigorously publicized with great fanfare, so their publications are increasing in sales day by day. As for the use between groups, there is no need to seek far, just look at the bad neighbor who makes goodwill a cliché. At first, they took advantage of the Qing government's confusion, and in the Jiawu year, they cut off Korea and Taiwan. In the Republic of China, they took advantage of Yuan Lao Tou's desire to be emperor and signed the Twenty-One Demands. They also used the new and old warlords to seize power and provided them with weapons, ammunition, and money to fuel the civil war. Using the strategy of defeating them one by one, they easily obtained the four eastern provinces, and also used... used... The past cannot be said, and the future cannot be said, alas! I don't know if our weaknesses are too many? Or is it that people are good at using them? I need to ask the smart readers.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Yao Zirang</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Yao Zirang has already passed away, and the people of Shanghai mourn him. During his life, he enjoyed a reputation for integrity. Without dwelling on it, I would like to collect a few anecdotes, some of which may be unknown to people, and briefly describe them as follows:</p>
<p>The establishment of academies in Shanghai was first promoted by Longmen, and during the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was the Gezhi Academy. It was established by Tang Jingxing, an observer, along with Danish lawyer Dan Wen, and Westerner Fu Lanya. They hired Tiannan Dun Sou (Wang Tao) as the supervisor of the academy, dividing the year into four seasons for setting topics and inviting the authorities to set questions for the scholars. Their merits were judged to determine the rankings, and those at the top were given rewards from the academy's funds. The authorities also allocated funds and encouraged them to boost interest. Therefore, Gezhi and Longmen were opposed. At that time, Longmen emphasized classical texts, while Gezhi focused on current affairs. Those listed in Longmen were considered the old school, while those listed in Gezhi were considered the new school.</p>
<p>The new school included figures such as "Wang Zuo Cai," "Zhong Tianwei," "Yin Zhi Lu," and "Xu Ke Quan," who were often ranked as super-class; while in the old school, Li Zhongjue (Ping Shu) and Yao Zirang occasionally stood out, holding the highest reputation in Longmen.</p>
<p>In a certain year, the education supervisor of Songjiang Prefecture, when observing local customs, set the topic as "Strategies for Coastal and Maritime Defense." Yao and Li competed. Yao argued that "preventing foreign aggression is the key to controlling the powers, and self-strengthening is the fundamental task, ultimately aiming for a situation where the emperor is virtuous and the defense lies in appeasing the barbarians," as the goal. Li, on the other hand, emphasized "the importance of the southeast sea ports, especially Wusong," with the most insightful statement being, "allowing the enemy to attack our fixed fortifications with mobile artillery, while we counter with fixed artillery against mobile ships." Yao and Li's essays were both highly praised by their teachers and included in the "Jiangzuo School Scholar Records." Yao's nephew, Liang (named Wen Dong), had a different personality from Zirang, being more rigid and conservative. He once corresponded with Tiannan Dun Sou. His younger brother sometimes mocked him, but the older brother retorted, criticizing his impracticality. Yao Zirang's son, Mengsao, unfortunately died tragically in Harbin. Upon hearing the news, everyone mourned, but his father said: "This is probably fate. I knew this would happen, but I didn't listen and it ended up like this. What else can I blame?" as if he had foreseen it. The scholarly atmosphere in Shanghai has gradually declined in recent years, and some are even criticized for academic cliques. However, Yao Zirang, amidst the ups and downs, still took it upon himself to promote integrity and eliminate corruption. Looking to the future, in the Chun Shen and Hu Du regions of Shanghai, I fear there will be no such central figure. Alas!</p>
<h3>Spectator's Guide for Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Hu Xuguang</p>
<p>(1) The later you arrive, the better. Movie theater patrons mostly like to stand up and let you rub past them, stepping on their toes, which they especially welcome.</p>
<p>(2) Before sitting down, stand and take off your coat. If the glasses of an old gentleman in the next seat or the hat of a young lady in the front row unfortunately block your coat's path, then the glasses and hat are not sensible and should go to the floor; it's none of your business. While taking off your coat, feel free to stand there for a while. The people behind you are here specifically to admire your back.</p>
<p>(3) Sitting on an old lady after finding the wrong seat is also something that should happen in the dark. Who told that old lady to sit according to the seat number?</p>
<p>(4) The synopsis must be read aloud. If you brought a girlfriend, you should explain the plot and dialogue in the film clearly, like a teacher lecturing her. The beneficiary will definitely not be just your girlfriend.</p>
<p>(5) When the main character in the film sings, you should clap to the rhythm and raise your voice to sing along with him. Patrons pay money, and a small part of it is to watch the play, but the majority is to listen to you sing.</p>
<p>(6) Predict the plot of the movie, pull on the person in the next seat, and tell them what's going to happen. Most movie theater customers are idiots, and the people sitting next to you are especially foolish. They paid money to not only watch the play but also to have their minds enlightened. Their gratitude will be endless, of course.</p>
<p>(7) The play should be realistic and have interruptions. You should cough a few times and spit a few times along with the plot of the movie to show realism. Sunflower seeds, peanut shells, and banana peels are also necessary interruptions.</p>
<p>Inside the Hongmiao Temple, incense smoke flickers. I, a devoted patriot, feel at ease in my old age.</p>
<p>In front of the racecourse, I feel a sense of desolation. Buildings like Hua An stand tall like black gallows in the shadows. In the night wind, the nearby street trees stretch out iron branches, clasping the silver string moon, singing naturally.</p>
<p>The door of Carso is half-open, flowing with hot "jazz." Eupetic rhythm involuntarily crossed inside. My stomach is already full, let's have a cup of "Kafei." Across from me is a modern girl, talking about sand crabs, but she herself is an old crab. The bright white fox collar can't hide the wrinkles at her temples.</p>
<p>"My wandering soul is accustomed to freedom, again treading willow catkins across Xie Bridge"... A long afterimage accompanies me on my way home.</p>
<h3>The Night Before</h3>
<p>— Cai Dezhi</p>
<p>The neon lights, inlaid in the lead-gray sky, truly resemble a dim ancient bronze mirror, a touch of red, a moment of melancholy.</p>
<p>All day long, cramming for the night school exam, Saturday night is a rare treat. I left the office and lightly stepped into the Le Xiang Hotel, ate a comfortable dinner. Coming outside, I felt happy in my heart, the taste of the dishes was not bad.</p>
<p>Passing the Palaoe Hotel, through the glass windows facing the street, gentlemen and ladies were still sipping tea leisurely. Elegant lighting, classical wall decorations, and a pianist on the music stage were playing a tune. An artistically styled hairstyle, a young man's face.</p>
<p>Advertisements for airline tickets, with blue backgrounds and white letters, fluttered everywhere like bargain flags. Roosevelt, the monster who advises the public to restrain their luck-seeking mentality during national crises, should first show his face on Nanjing Road, so he won't embarrass himself again next time.</p>
<p>Chen Yumei's hypnotic songs have already been sung all over Nanjing Road, but they are still a hit. There are so many pedestrians, and so many women. Carelessly, I bumped into someone. "Why don't you have eyes?" I only blame myself for being so engrossed in watching, earning myself a scolding for my trouble.</p>
<p>If there are only rough materials and unfinished products around the Great World, then this is where the refined products are. Eel-like bodies, dazzlingly decorated with poisonous scales. Charming amber, evenly spread on Claire La Belle-style powder. De Ge Paila's darling lady, a consumer of 1.4 million Western cosmetics!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Difficult to Endure the Pain, Focusing on the Music to Encourage Sentiment, Unsuccessful Farewell to the Flying Talisman</p>
<p>The shop assistant did not reply but smiled as he looked at him. Then he said, "Doesn't the Second Master contribute a share?" Ji Zhi said, "They didn't send me an invitation, how can I give a gift?" As he spoke, he turned around and walked towards the study in his house. His books had all been moved to the Dagongmen Village School. This was his elder brother's study. He casually took a book from the bookshelf and sat down at the writing desk to read. Opening the book, it turned out to be a copy of the Amitabha Sutra. He thought to himself, "Things in the world are so contradictory. My elder brother is a most enthusiastic person, yet he has this kind of Buddhist book on his bookshelf." So he casually opened the book and looked at the first line: "Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was in the Jeta Grove, Anathapindika's Park, in the country of Shravasti." After reading it, he could guess the general meaning but could not fully understand it. Holding the book in his hand, he raised his head slightly and thought for a moment. Then he thought, "Who cares if I understand it or not, I'll just use it to relieve boredom. Fortunately, there are explanations after the sutra text, so I can patiently read on and calm myself down. Otherwise, I would go crazy today." So he carefully read the explanations and understood them clearly, then continued reading down a few lines. He felt he could barely understand a little, then came a long string of Sanskrit transliterated names of people, such as Elder Shariputra, Maha Maudgalyayana, Maha Kasyapa, Maha Katyayana... He saw that there were two lines of this, not only not knowing what they meant, but also feeling a little dizzy. Just as he was spacing out, the sound of loud music entered his ears. He thought, "This must be a flower carriage going to pick up the bride." I don't want to listen to this kind of sound, I'll go play in the backyard. At this time, his elder brother, Houzhi, had recovered from his illness by eighty or ninety percent. He placed a rattan chair in the sun in the backyard, lay on the rattan chair, and held a magazine to read. His sister-in-law was also knitting a woolen sweater on a small chair next to him. Ji Zhi slowly walked over and said to Houzhi, "You've only just recovered a little, you don't need to read." Houzhi said, "It's good you're here. After today, you can go back to school to teach tomorrow. I've already recovered, so I don't need you to take care of me at home."</p>

<h3>Solitary Lament for a Cold Soul</h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>Walking alone with a stick, not with much enthusiasm to appreciate the scenery of West Lake after a long absence. But, occasionally seeing fallen leaves on the dike and withered trees at the foot of the mountain, when a sense of winter's desolation fills my heart, a desolate heart will recognize the true meaning of life. Perhaps it's because I don't have this kind of mood when I casually invite two or three friends to hang out! Wine, women, and boring small talk will give us boundless joy. Not to mention this desolate winter afternoon, even the fragrance of flowers and songs of birds in spring would let the charming delicate voices and dazzling calves occupy the poet's spirit first. Nature doesn't want boring tourists to disturb its poetic realm. Loneliness is the return of all things. People with lonely hearts, stumbling in nature's realm of solitude, everything is silent in the silence where there is no noise. A heart like stagnant water will also ripple with the spring of life.</p>
<p>Frozen clouds like gray ice lie motionless, staying at home, and worrying about a furnace of red charcoal. Endless troubles are smoked by the flames until I can't breathe. "Let's take a walk outside!"</p>
<p>"Where to go? I guess the cold plum blossoms on Gushan have already announced the spring news!" Carrying a cane, I have decided where to go.</p>
<p>The bustling streets stir the beating of life. Even in the cold winter, the east end of the street is red-eyed at the automobile's power, lying in the alley and daydreaming. Let this old man eat some dim sum! After a single negotiation, he agreed to his request. A snail-like posture, regretting that I called him to pull the cart, the conflicting consciousness of selfishness and charity is stirring again.</p>
<p>The desolate lakeside is filled with sparse yellow leaves. White water and gray mountains, West Lake has lost its former beauty.</p>
<p>In winter, on a hazy, snowy winter afternoon, walking alone on Bai Causeway, I often think of the life of the poet-monk Manshu wearing a bamboo hat and straw sandals, and feel sympathy as if I experienced it myself. Ah! Manshu's life is autumn and winter.</p>
<p>No one on the long causeway, slowly chanting wildly, a few gusts of cold wind pass through the drooping willows, chilling people to the bone. This is a gift in loneliness, you won't meet it if you don't go out.</p>
<p>From the Gushan Road lined with willow branches, one can hear the roaring of steam whistles from the opposite bank, which are the shuttle buses of the Grand Auditorium Cinema. Entertaining oneself in the dark in the cinema during the day is a proper pastime for civilized people.</p>
<p>"If you want to ask about the news of the plum blossoms, why wait for the cranes to return!" Since Lin Hejing left the world, his loving wife and beloved children were also unwilling to stay here. It's good, the soulmate of life and death is gone, why bother staying alone and suffering unnecessary torture. The three hundred cold blossoms have long gone with the flying cranes, leaving only a few plants that are greedy for the world, which are also withered with sparse branches and flowers.</p>
<p>Light green, faint red, lush, delicate, the delicate makeup of the past, the lingering dream shadows, still vaguely in a piece of cold cloud, longing for past joys.</p>
<p>In tranquility, in coldness, I seem to hear the towering ancient trees, rustling to express some sympathy to people. Perhaps there is no such sympathy in the fickle human world!</p>
<p>"The plum blossoms in Gushan are not good, Lingfeng is much better, and there are more people there!"</p>
<p>A few exclamations floated in my ear, on the noisy way home in the car.</p>

<h3>Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China Holds Public Exhibition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Opening on the 28th of this month at the Institute on Chengxian Street</p>
<p>Ten Years of Effort Accumulating Extremely Rich Resources Domestically Unparalleled</p>
<p>Collecting All Species of Flounder in the World Particularly Valuable</p>
<p>Separate Room Dedicated to Displaying Animals and Plants Needed by Middle Schools</p>
<p>The Hainan Biological Science Collection Group, initiated by the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, departed from Beijing on the 15th of this month to collect specimens in Hainan. The staff at the Institute, feeling the recent attention of the public to biological science, and also due to the invitation of the Nanjing Middle School Teachers' Biological Research Association for the Institute to hold a public exhibition as soon as possible, so that Nanjing students and the general public can observe and learn, in order to enhance their knowledge of biological science, began to prepare for the public exhibition immediately after the departure of the Hainan Collection Group. Now everything is ready, and it is scheduled to be held in Beijing for two weeks starting on the 28th of this month. During this exhibition period, it is free to visit without purchasing tickets. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening in Beijing for a Two-Week Period</p>
<p>Nanjing Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China</p>
<p>, Public Exhibition, decided to open at the Institute in Wende Lane, Chengxian Street, on the 28th of this month. The exhibition period is two weeks. The exhibits this time are the research achievements of the Institute over the years. All domestic animal and plant species, regardless of high or low level, that have been studied by the Institute, are displayed one by one, labeled with scientific names, Chinese names, and place of origin, and have maps recording their distribution. It is a real-life portrayal of the native products of the country. Examining material evidence, unlike other exhibitions that emphasize ornate decoration, can be achieved in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Exhibits Mostly Practical Science</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Science Society of China, this time the exhibits in each room are not only pure science, materials related to taxonomy and geographical distribution, but also related to practical science. For example, the wood specimens in the plant section, the branches, leaves, fruits, seeds, and wood of each plant, and their distribution are all clearly explained one by one. Specimens and enlarged color pictures of commonly seen and edible algae are displayed. And the fungi related to agricultural crops and forest tree diseases are arranged according to the natural environment to show their natural growth state. In the animal section, such as human parasites, not only are the male and female adults collected, but also their cocoons and larvae, and even their intermediate hosts, such as snails and water snails, are collected as much as possible, and supplemented with drawings to show their life process and the symptoms of the patients. Therefore, it not only demonstrates the richness of our country's natural products and the achievements of academic research, but also shows the public's common sense of hygiene and touches on economic appreciation and use.</p>
<p>Valuable Varieties in the Classification Room</p>
<p>As for the classification room, there are many rare and valuable specimens. The cones of various pine and fir plants are displayed in taxonomic order, which is rare in the country. The specimens of the Cashew family of higher plants are particularly complete. Corals and sea lilies are displayed, and what is particularly rare is that the Institute has collected all species of flounder in the world, which are also displayed in the exhibition room, showing the panorama of flounder, which is truly a treasure trove unparalleled in the world. The collection of fish can be said to be the first in the country, and the number of other animal and plant species displayed is also difficult to compare with domestically. The Institute's ten years of effort can be seen here.</p>
<p>A Separate Room for Middle School Specimens</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of the Nanjing Middle School Teachers' Biological Research Association, the Institute has set up a separate room dedicated to displaying animal and plant specimens needed by middle schools, and the process of specimen taxidermy and slide preparation is also shown in detail with brief explanations, so that students can understand it at a glance. At the same time, the Institute's research papers are also stored in multiple copies in the library for sale.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Educational Society Opens</h3>
<p>Chairman Liu Tingfang Delivers Opening Address Zheng Xigu Reports</p>
<p>Central Party Department Zhang Zifan Ministry of Education Gu Shusen Encouraging Words</p>
<p>Afternoon Reading Papers and Discussing Education Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) The second annual meeting of the Chinese Educational Society opened at 9:00 am on the 25th at the Central University Gymnasium. The opening ceremony is divided into the following details</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Members Ma Ketan, Gong Qichang, Wu Yunrui, Zhao Naizhuan, Tai Shuangqiu, Zhao Yan, Jiang Qi, Du Yuanzai, Yu Rensheng, Zhang Yi, Gu Huizhi, Ou Yuanhuai, Ma Zhenyao, Zhuang Zexuan, Wang Tang, Shen Guanqun, Yuan Dunli, Yuan Xueli, Shen Zishan, Zhao Mian, Gu Shusen, Peng Baichuan, Xu Chengyuan, Guo Yicen, Ni Wenya, Gao Juefu, Zhou Ruizhang, Liu Tingfang, Chen Lijiang, Yang Lianggong, Gu Mei, Xu Keshi, Zhong Daozan, Du Zuozhou, Chen Zunmei, Cao Peiyan, Wang Zhuoran, Gao Junshan, Wang Junyi, Zhang Zhonghuan, Zheng Xigu, Mao Yanwen, Zhang Zhenyu, Li Xinian, Zhou Bangdao, Wu Yanin, Tong Runzhi, Luo Tingguang, (Peng Baichuan representative) Fang Wanbang, Wang Shulin, Zhang Gengxi, Xie Xunchu, Sun Dezhong, Tan Tiankai, Zhu Junyi, Liu Yichang, Wang Chunrong, Cao Zuozhong, Luo Guangying, Li Qingsong, Huang Jianzhong, Chen Jianxiao, and guests Zhang Zifan of the Central Party Department, Wang Chongzhi, Director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Chen Yuguang of Jindai, and dozens of principals of primary and secondary schools in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 am, chaired by Liu Tingfang, recorded by Yang Bingxun, and emceed by Wu Yunrui. After performing the ceremony, the chairman delivered the opening speech, briefly stating that the Chinese Educational Society was established during the national crisis. At this time of national crisis, everyone knows that education to save the country is like a distant water that cannot put out a nearby fire. However, as long as those engaged in education can make up their minds, the so-called speed is sometimes possible, and the goal can always be achieved. Therefore, although people in the education field know that educational undertakings are slow, there is nothing more important than this. Everyone must have this hope in mind, and education is the entire science of life. To save the country, we must start with education. After the establishment of this association, not much work has been done in the past. The work that should be done after this second annual meeting will be discussed at the meeting. This session is held in Beijing, and I am very grateful to the preparatory personnel in the capital and the Zhongda Luo Principal and Dean of the College of Education for their efforts and equipment, etc. Then Zhang Zifan of the Central Party Department delivered an encouraging speech, briefly stating that China has many problems to solve, but the most important is education. In the past two years, the domestic education community has published many education reform plans, and the Central Committee also resolved many proposals on education at the Third Plenary Session. But all of you can see that there are many places such as education administration, education system, education equipment, etc., that feel dissatisfied. If you want to reform many dissatisfactions, you must take care of the country and the nation. But under this modern dark society, the will of the general youth is not firm, their thoughts are troubled, some are content to degenerate, some are seeking resistance, some only know how to study, regardless of the country, and even participate in meaningless struggles. Therefore, this situation is truly an obstacle to the future of the reform movement. Therefore, on the one hand, the government is still overcoming difficulties and continuing to carry out reforms, and on the other hand, it hopes that the education community will lead the youth, correct their mistakes, and carry out reforms on the same track. The Chinese Educational Society is organized by well-known people in the education field. In the future, it will study good methods and plans to help the government and guide the youth. The future is very promising, etc. Then Gu Shusen of the Ministry of Education delivered an encouraging speech, briefly stating that he is a member, although Minister Wang ordered him to represent the meeting, but speaking as a member, since the outbreak of the national crisis in China, the education administration has paid special attention to national rejuvenation and production education. Therefore, in recent years, the Ministry of Education has made changes to the curriculum and revisions to laws and regulations based on these two major goals. However, the regulations drafted by the Ministry are mostly subjective and have too few objective opinions. Because the domestic education community itself does not have the organization of academic research groups, the opinions sought are only sought from those known by private individuals, which is not as effective as gathering wisdom from all sources, so when it is put into trial implementation, it is not completely satisfactory. It is difficult to avoid the feeling of building a car behind closed doors and not being able to adapt to the situation. Now that the Chinese Educational Society is established, it can truly be the largest advisory body to help the administrative side. In the future, it should cooperate with the administrative side practically. He hopes that the association will be an educational experimental institution, because the educational society has a plan for three kinds of experimental work, requesting experiments: (1) Mass education, (2) Industrial science experiment (3) Primary school production education experiment, (industrial science refers to agricultural and industrial production experiments in rural normal schools). Therefore, he hopes that this association will have three points: (1) I hope to be the central organization for education experiments, (2) I hope to be a government consultant advisory or suggestion organization (3) I hope to expand the organization, on the one hand, increase the strength to produce greater effects, and at the same time, I can gather more experts to study various professional problems separately. Then Zheng Tonghe reported on the association's affairs, briefly stating that this association held its founding meeting in Shanghai on January 28, and one year has passed since then, and reported one by one the various important tasks that the board of directors has gone through. Regarding the experimental work that Gu Si has hoped for from this association, he also made a report stating that the experiment of mass education has been entrusted to Wuxi Education College for experimentation, and the experiment of industrial science has been carried out by Huangdu Township Teacher, both of which have achieved good results. The experiment of primary school production education has also been entrusted to several places to handle, but the situation of its work has not been reported to the committee. He then reported on the income and expenditure of funds.</p>
<p>Then Jin Da Principal Chen Yuguang, Zhongda Provost Chen Jianxiao, Wang Chongzhi, Director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and others delivered speeches successively. Then the chairman replied, took a photo, and the meeting adjourned. In the afternoon, papers were read and education issues were discussed.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Meeting</h3>

First, the papers were read: (1) Liu Tingfang read on behalf of the Director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau (Dr. Marek and Danish Public School) (2) Tong Runzhi read the general situation of junior middle schools and the implementation of the curriculum in our country (3) Chen Zunshan read on behalf of Pan Wenan, vocational education and national defense, (4) Zheng Tonghe read on behalf of Sheng Xixi, a study of the Chinese academy system, then passed the proposal submitted by the board of directors to the association to carry out research work (1) The annual meeting decides on research topics, and the committee is responsible for carrying out the research, and asks each branch to assist, (2) Introduce the experimental research of each education institution, (3) Solicit individual research from each member, and decide on the central research problems for the next annual meeting from the 16 special topics proposed by the board of directors and temporarily proposed by the party members, including (1) Teacher training, (2) The direction and curriculum of the education department of the university, (3) The implementation of production education, etc.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm, and the meeting will continue on the 26th.</p>

<h3>New York Museum of Natural History Sends Personnel to Sichuan and Xikang to Collect Specimens</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese American Yang Dize to Depart Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese American Yang Dize, commissioned by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow morning aboard the Minsheng Shipping Company's Yongnian steamer. He will travel to Sichuan, Xikang, Qinghai, Gansu, and other provinces to collect specimens of flora and fauna. He will also cooperate with the Natural History Museum of the Academia Sinica in China in collecting these specimens. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Yang at his Shanghai residence yesterday and learned the following details:</p>
<p>A Year-Long Journey Yang Dize's ancestral home is in Guangdong. He grew up in the United States and therefore holds American citizenship. For the past five years, he has traveled back and forth between China and the United States. Two years ago, he ventured alone into Tibet, Xinjiang, and other provinces to explore and collect numerous animal specimens. This time, representing both the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and the Natural History Museum of the Academia Sinica in China, he will travel to Xikang, Sichuan, Qinghai, and other provinces to collect specimens. The trip is scheduled to last one year, but he hopes to complete the assigned work within ten months, so he expects to return to Shanghai around November of this year.</p>
<p>Planned Route The route for this trip has already been planned. After arriving in Chongqing from Shanghai on the Yongnian steamer, he will switch to a boat to Ziyang. From Ziyang, he will travel overland through Ya'an to the Jinsha River area. He will then travel north into Qinghai and arrive in Gansu. He plans to stay in Xikang, Qinghai, and Gansu to collect specimens of flora and fauna. He will then take the Longhai Railway from Lanzhou back to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he will hand over the collected specimens of flora and fauna to the Academia Sinica first. The museum will keep those specimens it does not already have, and the rest will be taken back to the United States by Mr. Yang to report on his mission.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel In addition to his wife, Mr. Yang will be accompanied by his younger brother, Di Lin. Their passports and other documents are all prepared. He also carries a letter of introduction from Cai Yuanpei, the president of the Academia Sinica. Besides luggage, Mr. Yang's party is carrying a six-inch handgun, one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, and three shotguns with three hundred and fifty thousand rounds of ammunition. They have also obtained a transport permit from the National Government military authorities.</p>
<h3>Promoting Social Education Should Focus on the National Language</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) The Ministry of Education, based on a submission from the National Guoyu (National Language) Education Promotion Association, requests that all provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus, when promoting social education, should focus on the National Language. The measures are as follows: (1) Staff members of all levels of educational institutions who are handling social education must recognize and pay attention to phonetic symbols and be able to write in the National Language; otherwise, they will not be employed. (2) People's schools should first teach phonetic symbols to help with literacy. (3) People's reading materials and various official announcements should use the National Language. Phonetic symbols should be added to the edited text and news as appropriate. (4) Public places such as people's schools, education halls, libraries, and reading rooms should purchase Guoyu charts, phonetic books and newspapers, phonetic symbol machines, and other materials to display and promote their study and use.</p>
<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Distributes Winter School Subsidies</h3>
<p>For the year 1933, 83 private Chinese schools within the Public Settlement have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council to receive subsidies. According to reports from the Director of Education and the Acting Director of Health, with the exception of one school, the rest have made satisfactory progress and are willing to follow the Council's instructions to improve in all aspects. The Board of Directors has approved the distribution of winter subsidies to all schools except the one mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reviews Budget of Chinese Schools</h3>
<p>The draft budget for this year for the Shanghai Municipal Council's five private Chinese primary schools, five Chinese middle schools for boys and girls, one normal school, and the Chinese Education Office has been submitted to the Education Committee. After discussion, the Committee decided to remove several items from the proposed additions, such as radio equipment, film preservation cabinets, and counting machines. It also requested the Director of Education to further reduce the number of experimental laboratory instruments and specimens. Other items can be listed as they are and transferred to the Finance Committee for review. This case has been submitted to the Board of Directors at its meeting on Wednesday for approval and record.</p>
<h3>Attention Students' Families of Municipal Schools</h3>
<p>Official Receipts Required for Fee Payments</p>
<p>Announcement Issued by the Municipal Education Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau announced yesterday: "It has been found that municipal primary schools, middle schools, and kindergartens in this city collect tuition and construction fees from students. According to the accounting regulations of this city, one copy of the official four-part receipt co-printed by this Bureau and the Finance Bureau must be issued to be considered legal. This Bureau has issued a notice to all municipal schools to comply with this regulation from the second semester of this year.

<h3>County Education Bureau Withholds January Funds for Guantao Elementary School</h3>
<p>Due to Unclear Handover by Former Principal</p>
<p>Wang Shengfu (also known as Wang Boying), the principal of Guantao Primary School in the Second District of Shanghai County, was dismissed by order of the Education Bureau due to unsatisfactory school management as determined by the bureau's inspection. He Yunwen was appointed as the new principal. The new principal, He, accompanied by Huang Zhenzhong, a representative from the Education Bureau, went to the school yesterday to take over. However, Wang Shengfu not only failed to provide a clear inventory of the school's equipment and books but also refused to hand over the school seal. As a result, the new principal's handover was unsuccessful. Currently, to rectify the situation, the Education Bureau has decided to temporarily withhold the school's January funds until the handover is clear.</p>

<h3>Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce Notifies All to Reject Donations Solicited in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Instructs All Agencies and Schools to Take Note</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued the following instruction to all its affiliated schools and agencies yesterday: "A letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manila, Philippines, states: 'To whom it may concern, in recent years, business in the Philippines has been declining daily. Chinese merchants, both large and small, are in precarious situations and struggling to survive. However, those who come to the Philippines to solicit donations from the mainland are arriving one after another, even more than before. Given this situation, if we do not carefully consider and control the situation, currency will flow out, and the markets will become empty, leading to a continuous decline and eventual ruin. Considering this, to protect the position of the Chinese community in the Philippines, this Chamber convened a joint meeting on December 5th with the Chinese Educational Association, the Chinese Benevolent Society, and various Chinese trade associations. They all agreed that it is necessary to sympathize with the difficult times and stop donating money to allow for recovery and benefit trade. It was decided that 'starting from next year (1934), all those who come to the Philippines to solicit donations from the mainland will be rejected. If necessary, a joint meeting of the above-mentioned organizations will be convened to resolve the matter.' Based on this, we hereby record the case and instruct you to take note and inform all local agencies and organizations. If anyone intends to go abroad to solicit donations, they should not go to the Philippines to avoid unnecessary travel and wasted time.'"</p>

A request should be submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for record. We hereby inform you of this matter and hope that you will accept the position.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Continuing the Discussion on "Shanghai Style"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Congwen defines "Shanghai Style" as "the combination of a scholar's talent and sentiment with commercial competition, thus establishing our current concept of the term 'Shanghai Style.'" Mr. Xu Maoyong raises an objection, believing that "if there truly is a distinction between 'Shanghai Style' and 'Beijing Style' in the literary world, then I believe commercial competition is a characteristic of the former, while a scholar's talent and sentiment are characteristics of the latter." This made me recall a passage from Mr. Lu Xun's lecture on a glimpse of Shanghai literature and art. When the Shanghai foreign settlement was first opened, talented scholars, often melancholic and sickly, came from all over. They regarded Zhang Garden as the Grand View Garden and the prostitutes as the Twelve Beauties of Jinling, believing that "only talented scholars can pity these fallen beauties, and only beauties can recognize the unfortunate scholars," thus becoming like celestial couples. Unfortunately, they later "discovered that the beauties did not become prostitutes out of a thirst for talent but purely for money. They felt it was unacceptable for the beauties to want money from the talented scholars, so they devised various ingenious methods to subdue the prostitutes, not only avoiding being tricked but also taking advantage of them." Therefore, the initial form of Shanghai Style was talented scholars plus fools, which later progressed to become talented scholars plus hooligans.</p>
<p>In a shop window in East Xinqiao, there is a painting with the famous line "The Eight Immortals Playing Mahjong" inscribed on it. Of course, it should also have a painting of "The Eight Immortals Hunting Pheasant" to make it perfect, but we are already satisfied. It interprets the meaning of "Shanghai Style" more clearly than thousands of words. The Eight Immortals are so pure and lofty, so detached from the mundane world; but once they arrive in the foreign settlement, they cannot help but "modernize" and live a "mahjong-playing" life. We ordinary people are even more likely to do so. The imposing Lake Society next to Stealing Chicken Bridge was formerly the famous Shou Sheng Nunnery. According to investigations, in the secret chambers, in addition to various cosmetics, there are also substances like white turbid powder. In the west gate, there is a grand residence with many wives and concubines, whose master is the abbot of a certain mountain. The one who performed rituals at the Great World in 1933 was none other than Zhang, the Heavenly Master, who had left Longhu Mountain. This Shanghai foreign settlement has its own greatness. Any powerful demon, no matter what kind of disguise it wears, whether it is a Taoist robe, a Buddhist cassock, or a long gown and mandarin jacket, will eventually reveal its true form in this large mirror, with a long tail dragging behind it.</p>
<p>Writers and artists, though also fox spirits who have cultivated themselves for thousands of years, have beautiful patterns such as "morality," "purity," and "spiritual life" embroidered on their outer garments; however, in the "mirror that reveals demons," their true forms are still revealed. From the perspective of the Beijing Style, this is of course a bit glaring, with such a long tail dragging outside the outer garment. But what can be done? This is where the divergence between "Beijing Style" and "Shanghai Style" comes in: knowing that it cannot be concealed, simply drag the tail out, this is "Shanghai Style"; twisting and turning, still trying to lengthen the outer garment and cover the tail, this is "Beijing Style." The sage said: Better "Shanghai Style" than "Beijing Style." It is always too tiring to constantly pay attention to the hem of the outer garment. In the terminology of Shanghai Style, there are so-called X-style and Y-style things, such as a 1934-style car, a 1934-style cheongsam, which in commercial competition, is called "market price." Unfortunately, the 1933-style Shanghai Style writer has been kicked out of the commercial competition market; new books are weighed and priced by the pound, and friends who solicit manuscripts can hardly even afford the northwest wind. The characteristic of merely "commercial competition" has also been crossed out. Looking at it this way, the 1934-style Shanghai Style writer is not enough with "talented scholar" plus "hooligan," there should be another kind of addition; unfortunately, I don't understand mathematics, I don't know how the formula in "Euclidean" geometry should be arranged!</p>
<h3>Going to the Yi Regions</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>"Men go to the Yi regions, women often remain widows. If they return alive, they bring epidemics; if they die, they are abandoned by the roadside."</p>
<p>Listening to the temporary travel companions, dragging out their voices, singing the folk songs of the Zhendongzhou people, a wisp of melancholy quietly wrapped around my heart. Following them as they turned down the hillside, I felt as if I lacked the strength that a traveler should have.</p>
<p>At the foot of the slope, a narrow, elongated wilderness, misty and desolate, stretched out to the gray horizon. This was the Yi region I was about to journey to, the miasmic and rainy Yi region.</p>
<p>High mountains, dark and gloomy high mountains, with white mists like turbans on their heads, stretched along both sides of the wilderness, appearing savage and fierce. In those white mists on the mountaintops, the homes of the wild people were hidden. Their lives, it was said, consisted of coming down the mountains to plunder the Bai Yi people in the wilderness and passing travelers.</p>
<p>At that time, it was probably past Qingming (Tomb-Sweeping Day). In the Han regions, it was still a warm spring, but here (called the Yi Fang Ba by the Yunnan people, and written as Ganya in the Yuan History) it was already like summer, with a stifling heat everywhere: the heat of the mist, the heat of the rain, the heat of the humidity.</p>
<p>My travel companion (a middle-aged man) said that before Qingming and up until September of last year, there was no shortage of sunny days here. There was a good sun every day, and you wouldn't see a single drop of rain. But now, we're out of luck. It rains several times every day. The rain here is not like the rain in the Han regions, it's poisonous and terrifying (you can easily get sick). And then there's the miasma, the miasma! God bless us! As he said this, his whole body trembled as if he had been suddenly attacked. He immediately rebuked me kindly, saying that as a young man, why didn't I come out in the twelfth lunar month? Was I here to die now?</p>
<p>As I listened to him, I saw the Bai Yi women on the road. Many of them had clear brows and bright eyes, and some of the farm girls were even more beautiful than Han Chinese women. So I said, aren't the people here living well?</p>
<p>"These are Yi people!" he retorted loudly; immediately citing many terrible cases of Han people getting miasma poisoning here. I had nothing to say, so I used one sentence to counter him, which was to say, then what are you doing in the Yi region now?</p>
<p>"Oh God, it's to earn a living, to support my family," he groaned in distress. Because I wanted to win the argument, I replied with a smile: "Aren't I the same as you?" In fact, at that time, I had no family, nor was I only working to support myself; most of the reason was because I was tired of the reality of my environment, so I wandered around like a gypsy. However, in order to see novel sights, I had come to such a discouraging place, so naturally, I couldn't help but feel a little melancholy.</p>
<p>"Then, are you doing the same kind of business as me?" he asked, his eyes flashing cunningly.</p>
<p>"What? What business are you doing?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Er... er..." he didn't answer, just humming his folk song of the Zhendongzhou people.</p>
<p>Later, when we reached the Ba Mu wilderness and were searched by plainclothes Burmese police, I learned that he, my very good travel companion, was smuggling opium. If I had known earlier, I would have put on the same mature expression as him and offered my advice like he rebuked me. But he, along with the contraband, was taken to prison that time, and I never saw him again.</p>

<p>The steam whistle howls. The locomotive, bulging its belly, charges forward, black smoke billowing straight up, trailing behind it in the wind.</p>
<p>Mountains, fields, and forests all recede.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, the train resembles a long snake. 'Ker-thump... ker-thump...' the rhythmically clanging wheels keep turning non-stop: Shanghai-Nanjing Express!</p>
<p>In the first-class carriage:</p>
<p>Spacious, clean, comfortable…</p>
<p>With a high-priced cigar in his mouth, standing by the glass looking at the scenery outside the train; in this "dignitary's" heart: 'It's winter, the beautiful fields are all withered and yellow.' His daughter throws aside a novel and relaxes. She looks at her father and, after a while, speaks:</p>
<p>'Dad, I'm not going back when we get to Shanghai!' 'What are you saying? What do you plan to do in Shanghai?'</p>
<p>'Study.'</p>
<p>'You can study in Nanjing. Why?'</p>
<p>'Isn't Shanghai better?... Sigh, let's talk about it slowly. Dad, I'm a bit hungry, let's order something to eat!'</p>
<p>Having said that, she stretches lazily and "ha"-s, exhaling.</p>
<p>Then, fifteen minutes later, a lot of things are brought.</p>
<p>While eating, the daughter smiles and strokes the "dignitary's" face.</p>
<p>In the second-class carriage:</p>
<p>Dragon Well tea, melon seeds, tabloids…</p>
<p>A section chief half-lying in his seat, reading a tabloid. He is middle-aged and sports a small mustache. A woman and her husband, sitting opposite him, both look tired, their eyes closed, dozing off. The section chief's eyes slip over from the newspaper. They linger on the woman's delicate face for a minute or two. Suddenly, the steam whistle howls again, the woman opens her eyes, and the section chief quickly looks back at the newspaper.</p>
<p>The woman takes a sip of Dragon Well tea.</p>
<p>The husband is sleeping like a pig. She glances indifferently at her slightly plump husband and shakes her head.</p>
<p>As the section chief changes to another newspaper, he thinks to himself: 'Not bad, this woman is desirable! But…' and touches the mustache on his lip.</p>
<p>In the third-class carriage:</p>
<p>Long gowns, melon-cap hats, noisy voices…</p>
<p>A Jiangbei woman, in such cold weather, bares her breasts to feed her child. A layer of darkness covers her face…</p>
<p>Suddenly, the child abandons the nipple and starts crying, crying loudly. A man wearing a melon-cap hat, sitting not far away, grumbles:</p>
<p>"Damn it! What are you crying for? Damn it…"</p>
<p>But how could the child understand people's annoyance? He continues to cry loudly, crying.</p>
<p>Noisy, clamorous,…</p>
<p>Women, children, men,…</p>
<p>The ticket inspector walks past here, followed by armed soldiers. An old man, seeing them pass, begins to talk to his daughter-in-law:</p>
<p>'The last time I went to Shanghai, I traveled fourth class… You don't know, the people in fourth class are all like pigs, so pitiful, so… That time, there were two poor people who didn't have money to buy tickets and were almost thrown off halfway! I saw them crying and even pleaded on their behalf to the ticket inspector!'</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing Express! The rhythmically clanging wheels keep turning non-stop: 'Ker-thump... ker-thump!...' Looking from afar, the train resembles a long snake.</p>
<p>Mountains, fields, and forests all recede.</p>
<p>The steam whistle howls. The locomotive, bulging its belly, charges forward, black smoke billowing straight up, trailing behind it in the wind.</p>
<p>Woo… woo… woo…</p>
<h3>On "Jealousy" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>The simplicity of the plot, especially the focus on the theme of jealousy, can easily make us think that the play will be lengthy, rambling, and tedious. But Pierre Hamp, worthy of being the son of the homeland of modern drama, writes very well. Through extremely appropriate and concise dialogue, he keeps the entire play developing tightly until the end, without paralyzing the characters due to the excessive expression of psychology, and without making the dialogue fall into looseness or tedium due to the scarcity of concrete facts. Although only four characters appear, he arranges them very well, with no unnecessary appearances and very few unnecessary words.</p>
<p>But if we examine it from an ideological perspective, the author commits the mistake of a vague consciousness. He sets the event against the backdrop of World War I, and the characters are also heavily influenced by the devastation of the war. However, he places the husband's jealousy under a generalized situation for a deep explanation. Although the words of this unfortunate couple occasionally reveal that the war destroyed this young man and caused their lives to suffer misfortune, the author certainly did not explain that the general public's disillusionment with hope and weariness of life after the war led to this morbid psychological suspicion. This fact can be proven by Blanche's thoughts and words. She says: "His country is attracting me. It is as if a door has suddenly opened, and from this door, I see a path that I have been seeking for a long time... Perhaps it is happiness." After the war, the countries of Germany, Austria, and France were destroyed, but only the United States was able to maintain a new and prosperous capitalist country. Europeans, looking at the tragic scenes around them after the war, could not help but yearn for the flourishing America. Blanche's remarks are merely representative of the general opinion of Europeans. However, in this play, the author says that it is because of the husband's unreasonable jealousy that she feels disillusioned, feels the ruthlessness of daily life, and endures the pain of abandoning her beloved person to run to a strange land.</p>
<p>In order to make the husband's jealousy a powerful reason for destroying their happy life, the author feels very difficult, especially because this is in dramatic literature, and this difficulty is shown very clearly. He painstakingly and meticulously uses the methods of French naturalism to dissect the psychology of jealousy, in order to make up for the development of events and show unnatural traces. But he ultimately cannot find a particularly appropriate reason, but only the old explanation of the conflict between love and jealousy. The impact of the war is only ancillary. He has André say: "I love you too much, I will love you more appropriately in the future. I don't know how to love you properly now. What returned to you from the Darmstadt camp was a barbarian, a person ruined by suffering." And, "... a kind of sinister suspicion sometimes covers my reason. It is just like an irresistible fever that is infected in people. If I didn't love you so much, it wouldn't have come to this. Ah! Forgive me!..." At the same time, in order to give André's jealousy a considerable basis, the author further arranged an anecdote, that is, the matter of the wife's friend, Jeanne. When André was in captivity, one of his companions named Weber died. At the time of his death, he revealed this secret to André - the secret love between Weber and Jeanne. André, due to the shock this matter gave him, later reasoned: "This man thought his woman was pure, and I also thought my woman was pure." "This man never left his woman. Me, I was away from home for four years." In this way, her jealousy seemed even more reasonable.</p>
<p>But, no matter how the author tries to make up for it, how he wants to convince the reader of the reason for jealousy destroying life, we can see another truth from the events he describes - if that is a faithful depiction of reality - that a powerful reason that destroyed their happy life. That is, the inevitable decline of their lives was bestowed by the war and determined by their era. For example, André, after returning home after four years of captivity, even if his wife did not give him any cause for suspicion, would they have lived happily together? That would also have been impossible. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Father and Daughter (7)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Miss, I'm disturbing you."</p>
<p>The female guest was so humble, so polite, and her voice was so pleasant. She deliberately took a step or two, gazing at the portrait hanging in the study. She knew her eyes were not mistaken. Her heart was pounding. She said to the woman, "Please sit down. You can take off your coat first."</p>
<p>Seeing the female guest take off her coat, she went over to take it and hung it on the coat rack behind the door. The female guest sat down, and she herself sat in the seat opposite.</p>
<p>The maid brought two cups of tea, placing them in front of them.</p>
<p>"Do you live in this city?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm just passing through. Once, oh, once I lived here too."</p>
<p>"Did you come to this city specifically to play?"</p>
<p>"Not really, I'm with my husband…"</p>
<p>The female guest stopped suddenly when she got to this point, as if something had grabbed her heart, and a little embarrassment was revealed. Seeing this, she let her drink some tea, and seeing her pick up the tea, she herself also raised the teacup to her lips. "We're going to X, passing through here, we'll only stay for two or three days."</p>
<p>After the female guest finished speaking, she fixed her eyes on a piece of plain silk hanging on the wall, on which were embroidered four lines of poetry about love between men and women. She remembered seeing that strange decoration when she was very young. She took a cigarette from her cigarette case and offered it to the female guest. "Would you like a cigarette?"</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>Because she was watching so intently, she was startled by her words, and she thanked her a little flusteredly. She struck a match and lit the cigarette for the guest. The female guest seemed very skilled and cleverly held the cigarette between the index and middle fingers of her right hand, which showed that she was a fan of cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Do you have something important to see my father about?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, just came to see him. He's an old friend of mine."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so!——"</p>
<p>She deliberately prolonged her voice.</p>
<p>"How has he been lately?"</p>
<p>"Very good, everything is fine,——"</p>

<h3>FINANCIAL AND GOLD MARKET SHORT COVERING GAINS MOMENTUM</h3>
<p>Reached a peak of $715.80</p>
<p>Resulted in a surge of $11.10</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was extremely active, reaching a high of $715.80, and</p>
<p>then fluctuating around the $10 mark. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw a contraction in England and stability in the US, exchange rates also fell, the forward silver price at the Metals Exchange dropped by amounts ranging from 2.5 to 5%, London spot gold rose by one penny, US cotton fell by four points, and US futures contracted by 0.25. Stocks, on the other hand, experienced a slight rise. The opening price for futures was $703.40, showing a steady trend. After the opening, interbank activity focused on buying US dollars, with a speculator named Wu bravely covering short positions. HSBC adjusted its exchange rate downwards, intensifying the internal market and creating excitement, leading to rapid increases. Subsequently, Qiao Zhibu's blockage of US dollar supply and banks' weak appetite resulted in a lack of buyers in the foreign exchange market. A Reuters dispatch from Washington reported that a new US Treasury bond issue of $1,000,000,000 had risen above its subscription price, and that the Senate was debating President Roosevelt's currency system proposal, but these news items had no real impact. In reality, the hardening of the foreign exchange market led to a weakening of the gold market, gradually retreating into the $10 range within the customs area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Reuters dispatch reported that President Roosevelt, while accepting restrictions on the currency bill period, opposed management of the stabilization fund by a five-member committee. It also reported that a Congressman named Davis proposed selling surplus agricultural products abroad in exchange for silver bars, with the silver bars being purchased at 25% above world prices for use as silver reserves. This caused another brief dip, but in the afternoon and subsequent market sessions, prices consistently fluctuated around the $10 mark, due to continued interbank buying of US dollars. Although banks blocked supply, there was considerable uncertainty, leading to instability in the gold market. The price of smelted silver was $1,095, with limited supply. What follows is a record of the day's market conditions.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was $706.20, up $7.80 from the previous close. Physical goods opened at $6.00. The foreign exchange market opened with the near-term selling price for British pounds at 1 shilling 4 1/8 pence and US dollars at $33.50. Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yugan, Changxiang, and Laijin advanced from $5.70 to $8.20. Yida, Yongda, and Decheng sold off, falling to $7.10. It was anticipated that HSBC's exchange rate would contract by 0.125 for British pounds and 0.375 for US dollars. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Mao Yongda, Changxiang advanced steadily. After entering the market, Mitsui and Zhengjin bid for May US dollars at 8.125, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Mao Yongheng, Xinghui, and Xiang all advanced, rising to $10.05. Hengyu provided goods, although with a slight dip. However, with the East Asia Zhengjin and Shanghai heavily bidding for May US dollars at 7.5, Gan Changxiang, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yong, and others advanced even further to $12.50. Zhengjin released May US dollars at 6.875, and the Dalian group Hengtai sold off, falling to $0.08. Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongyi, Chengda, Changxiang, Dafa, Yong Yongfeng, and others jointly bought in. Anticipation of HSBC's exchange rate contracting by 0.125 for British pounds and 0.25 for US dollars caused gold prices to surge. Qingfa and Yongbing Xing aggressively bought the most, rising to $5.80. Zhengjin and Hubei released April US dollars at 0.375 and May at 0.5625. Unfavorable foreign news caused Jiatai, Yifeng, Yongyi, Da Yong, Zhifeng, Yongrui, and Kang to sell off at the high, retreating to within $4.00. Later, the foreign exchange market suddenly loosened, with Sassoon and Qiao Zhibu both supplying. May US dollars at 6.875 were difficult to sell, and Hengxing, Yida, Yongyuan, Chang Yongheng, and Yu all sold off. April US dollars at 6.875 and May at 8.75 found no appetite from banks, and prices retreated to within $1.00. Hengxing, Hengxingyuan, and Fuan resold, and Bing Xing also supplied. Hubei released April US dollars at 0.75, causing a fall to $0.082. Finally, due to the aggressive buying by physical goods dealers such as Dafa, Yongda, and Changxiang at the low, the morning closed at $710.90, with physical goods quoted at $0.08.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening price was $711.90, with physical goods opening at $1.50. Fuyu and the Dalian group advanced, rising from $1.50 to $2.30. Zhengjin released March US dollars at $0.50, while Shanghai blocked sales of the same month at 5.625. Hengyu, Zhaofeng, and Chang sold off, falling to $0.092. Yuanmao Yong took the opportunity to buy in at the low, rising to $0.05 for a time. However, due to Hubei releasing April US dollars at 0.75, Fuan, Bingxing, and Yuanmao Yong sold off, and prices retreated to $0.092. Later, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Dafa Yong accepted the offer, and the internal market fluctuated, rising to $10.08. Zhengjin continued to block sales of March US dollars at 5.625 and $0.50. Yuanchun and Dafa Yong Hengyu sold off, but Yicheng bought in, causing some struggle. When Hubei released March US dollars at 0.625, Yida Yong sold at $0.089. Changsheng Yong limited its purchases, and the market stabilized. Interbank activity continued to buy US dollars. April US dollars at 6.875 suddenly became difficult to settle, and Hengyu, Daxing Yong, Yuanchang Yong, and others competed to buy, rising to $711.20. Mitsui released May US dollars at 9.375, and although Bing Xing bought in, Yuanda Yong and Fuyu sold off, falling to $0.093. Bing Xing continued to buy, and market sentiment was uncertain. After fluctuating, the closing price was $709.50, with physical goods quoted at the same price. The market was slightly stable after closing. The highest price for the day was $715.80, and the lowest was $705.70, with a fluctuation of $10.01. The result was a rise of $11.10 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The price adjustment was due to HSBC's US dollar exchange rate contracting by a total of 0.625 to $32.875, resulting in a standard gold price of $730. Based on the closing price, the deduction was approximately $20, slightly more than $2 higher than the previous close. The registered price for this month was $734, for February $725, and for March $711. The morning margin call was $734, and the afternoon margin call was $733. The price of smelted silver was $1,095. There were few transactions in the market, with limited supply. In the first session, the Tianjin group sold less than 1,000 taels to Yingfeng, Hengtai, and Kangrun at $1,095, which were then resold by fellow traders to the Tianjin group at approximately $1,097-1,098. There were few transactions. In the subsequent market session, out-of-town merchants accepted 1,100 taels of 99.3% fineness from Dadecheng and Dafengheng for sale to the Tianjin group, which were purchased by money shops at $1,101.50. At the same time, Tianjin goods were also swapped out, but there were still few swap transactions. As a result, there were still 1,561 forwards remaining for January and 6,489 for February. Transactions in the market were quite active overall. Qingfa Yongbing Xing, Dachangxiang, Huixiang, Hengtai, Ganchangxiang, Dafa Yong, Yong Yongfeng, Hengxingyuan, Hengchang Yongyi, Yu Zhifeng, Yongchang Shengsheng Yong, and others were primarily on the buying side. Hengxing, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuanchun, Ruikang, Renfa Yongtong, Chun Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanheng, Sida, Futai, Hengtai Fengcheng, Shunli Wanxing, and others were primarily on the selling side. Yuanchang Yongyi Cheng Xianghe first sold and then bought, while Daxing Yong Fuyu Yongde and others first bought and then sold. The Dalian group and Shunli jointly traded over 3,300 lots, netting over 600 lots. Wanxing jointly traded over 2,800 lots, netting over 500 lots. The Guangdong group Hengxing bought over 200 lots and sold approximately 1,100 lots. The total number of transactions for the day was 67,389 lots in the morning and 22,246 lots in the afternoon. The total number of March chips was 36,491 lots, with a total of 38 long positions and 60 short positions.</p>

This is a typical phenomenon at the end of the year. Trading volume was also low, with only 31,350 strings traded, representing a value of $11,000.</p>
<h3>FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES REMAIN LOW, LIQUIDITY REMAINS ABUNDANT</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange rates in the market remained low. Both the morning and afternoon sessions were at 4%, a slight decrease of 1% compared to the previous day.

<h3>SECURITIES AND BOND MARKETS EXHIBIT STRONG VOLATILITY</h3>
<p>| The outcome is still more gains than losses |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange experienced considerable fluctuations in the trading of this month's contracts, which were expiring on the last day. While short covering was still quite urgent, short selling and long positions were also actively emerging, resulting in extremely active trading. At the opening in the morning, various groups rushed to cover short positions, and prices only slightly improved by 0.12 to 0.65, with selling still occurring in numbers 4 and 46. Each item saw new highs again. February salt tax also reached $50. In the second session, major players continued to sell aggressively. Long positions were exiting, and new selling was significant. Selling of number 20 was especially strong, causing prices to uniformly fall back by about $0.50. First short covering, then long covering, also confirmed the reporter's predictions. The major players' goods were absolutely unwilling to be bought back, so long positions inevitably squeezed out. From the opening in the afternoon until 4 o'clock, the market was initially flat and then showed signs of weakness. During the auction of unified tax, there was still selling in number 20, and this month's contracts continued to weaken slightly. Although long-term contracts still saw selling, a large number of orders suddenly entered number 15, raising prices by 0.20 to 0.30, creating a tense situation on the trading floor. The salt tax also rose along with it, and this month's contracts broke through $51 again, reaching a new high. Long-term contracts also broke through the $50 mark. Short gold contracts experienced a squeeze, with this month's contracts surging by $0.90, completely reversing the previous rise and fall, demonstrating the urgency of both floating long and short positions. By the time the market closed at over 7 o'clock, price trends had stabilized, with consolidation slightly lower by 0.12 to 0.23, and the rest slightly better by 0.23. The salt tax was flat and weak, but short gold contracts fell sharply by $0.50 to $0.60. Today, only one month's futures for February were traded. As a result, market prices still saw more gains than losses, although fluctuations were only between $0.05 and $0.60. The total transaction volume was approximately 26 million, the details of which are omitted.</p>
<h3>NEW YORK RAILROAD STOCKS ADVANCE</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that the New York stock market was quite active on the 24th. Although long positions took profits, and commercial news was mixed, railroad stocks advanced due to favorable railroad reports, so the market remained firm. Speculative bonds rose sharply, high-quality bonds remained firm, and US government bonds saw minimal fluctuations due to the stabilizing influence of the Treasury Department's bond offerings. The total number of shares traded for the day was 3.36 million. According to Steel Century reports, the steel workload is currently at 32% because the needs of the automotive industry have not yet been realized, but large orders are expected in the next two weeks. Small consumers, including farm equipment factories and railroad machinery manufacturers, are purchasing more. It is reported that producers will increase the prices of sheet metal and other products if various groups continue to lack orders. The wheat market is sluggish and lacks excitement. A cold wave is developing in the Northwest, and there is currently no rain in the drought-stricken areas of the South, so it may be advisable to buy in. Private reports of cotton acreage reduction are disappointing, and even official opinions are not as optimistic as before, hinting at the possibility of mandatory legislation, but it will take longer. Fertilizer sales have increased, but caution is advised until there is a clear development. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<h3>YARN AND COTTON: FORWARD YARN PRICES REMAIN FIRM AND HIGH</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and lacks excitement. The surrounding environment is poor, and actual sales are sluggish, leading to weak sentiment. Some expect development in the coming spring. Forward prices are firmer, and Japanese yarn prices are cheap, which has increasingly impacted Chinese yarn. However, cotton prices are firm and high, causing difficulties for factories. In summary, it is still difficult to reduce cotton yarn inventories.</p>
<p>People's Standard: Quiet and Firm</p>
<p>The People's Standard market opened, with little trading in the market, and the market sentiment was flat. Each month rose by 0.12. It was reported in the afternoon that spot yarn transactions were slow, with nearly the same rise of 0.12 for far contracts. The total number of transactions for the day was 5,100 bales. Source Da sold 800 bales, Dachang sold 250 bales, and Gengfeng sold 500 bales. Tongfu bought 500 bales, Gengfeng bought 400 bales, Shenyu bought 350 bales, and Yongda bought 250 bales.

<p>Inland 129 Wuhu 5 Fujian 10</p>
<h3>GENTLE BREEZE OF BUYING IN FEBRUARY COTTON</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending firmer again. Because there are not enough delivery chips this month, the market is firmer than the yarn market. February contracts are especially popular because there are few business days at the beginning and end of the lunar year, and it is expected that it will be difficult for those delivering goods. Those taking long positions are becoming more numerous. However, overseas cotton markets are showing signs of softening.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Hardening</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened, and buying sentiment remained strong. Each month rose by</p>
<p>0.05 to 0.10. Later, near contracts rose by 0.05 to 0.10, and far contracts fell by 0.05. The total number of transactions for the day was 56,000 dan. Chunjie sold 4,000 dan, Tongji sold 1,000 dan, Dafeng sold 4,300 dan, Deji sold 1,200 dan, Jifeng sold 3,000 dan, and Shenchang sold 2,300 dan.

<h3>US COTTON LONG POSITIONS LIQUIDATED, RESULTING IN WEAKNESS</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was supported by Wall Street, and long positions were liquidated. The market was mixed, and the spot price fell by 5 points, while the futures price fell by 2 to 7 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 1 point, and futures prices rose by 7 to 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to slight selling by European exporters and liquidation of long positions. Later, the market recovered due to European exporters buying Omra cotton, resulting in a flat price for Jagra, a decrease of 0.5 rupees for Omra, and a decrease of 1 rupee for White Luo Creek. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dispatch from the 24th).</p>

<h3>Tea Exported in the 22nd Year</h3>
<p>｜Published by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau: 11% Increase Compared to the Previous Year｜</p>
<p>Customs figures for tea trade in the 22nd year have not yet been released, but a comparison of the export inspection numbers from the Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus reveals that they have</p>
<p>exceeded the 21st year by 11%. The prices of black tea from Hubei and Hunan were also higher than in the 21st year. Although Ping-Shui and Huizhou green teas fell by 40%, they remained stable with little fluctuation. Therefore, those engaged in sales and management in the 22nd year, except for the significant losses in Qimen tea and some unfavorable situations in Jiangxi Ninghong tea, mostly had some remaining profits to be made.</p>
<p>Amidst the global economic panic, the export of all products has suffered a severe decline. The fact that the tea industry can exhibit this phenomenon is not to be considered an unsatisfactory outcome. Enclosed is a table of the quantities of black tea, green tea, and brick tea exported to various countries in the last two years (unit: dan).</p>

<p>The order of the numbers in the above table is based on the quantity from each country, and the total numbers are the sum of countries such as Russia, Africa, America, and England. Silk tea accounts for more than half of Africa’s total, followed by the United States. Black tea is primarily dominated by England, followed by England. The brick tea category is completely dominated by Russia. The increase/decrease numbers are detailed in the previous table. However, the increase in black tea is mostly low-grade tea from Hubei and Hunan. Other teas exported to Russia include a small amount of rough tea and a</p>
<p>batch of scented tea, which is the latest type of tea imported by Russia.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice: Near-Term Futures Fall, Long-Term Rise</h3>
<p>Wheat Futures Show Little Fluctuation</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, due to the factory's previous two boatloads of wheat sold on credit, the market sentiment had softened. Additionally, shipments of fixed-price wheat were arriving continuously, with two new shipments expected by the end of the month. Small factories were making purchases of foreign wheat and</p>
<p>immediately hedging in the market. Large factories were taking a wait-and-see approach, but not taking advantage of small dips to cover their positions. Short-term speculative traders, considering the situation of the factories, were also selling at any time. However, while short-term speculative traders and retail investors were selling near-month contracts, they were buying back long-term contracts. Therefore, the longer-term months rebounded after a period of weakness, while near-month contracts lacked covering demand, and bulls were eager to sell. With small factories also hedging, the market could not hold steady. The closing price for this month was down 1.25 points, February and March were each down 0.25 points, April was up 0.5 points, May was up 2.5 points, and June was up 7.5 points.</p>
<p>There were no spot transactions for wheat, and inventory was low. Asking prices still ranged from $4.10 to $4.15. Wheat futures saw very little trading volume throughout the day due to year-end settlements, with neither side actively participating. Market prices showed little fluctuation, with the closing price down only 0.01 points for the current month, and minimal changes for other months.</p>
<h3>Increased Price of Guest Indica Rice Leads to Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, landlords of Guest Indica rice, noting the smooth sales of Kehua rice and limited arrivals, raised prices by 0.10 dollars. As a result, the Fujian traders reduced their purchases, with only over 200 bags of Nanjing machine indica rice transacted. Both local merchants and rural estates inquired about prices. Yesterday's market saw the transaction of 200 bags of Hunan machine oil rice at $7.10, 100 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice at $7.25, 25 bags of machine Yuan rice at $6.50, and 300 bags of Nanjing machine rice at prices ranging from $6.28 to $6.09, similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrivals of Late Rice</h3>
<p>｜Thick粳 Rice Sales Sluggish, Prices Slightly Lower｜</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of over 80 shipments arrived from various origins, amounting to over 10,000 piculs, with late rice accounting for half of the total. Fortunately, the outgoing path for wholesalers turned active, so the market conditions did not show much decline. However, goods such as Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sixi, and Xilian rice, and the 3,000 plus bags delivered by the Northern Tianjin Tanggu traders, the Southern Xiamen traders, and upper-tier warehouses saw a slight adjustment of 0.06 dollars. Due to the relatively abundant arrivals of thick 粳 rice from various traders, the local shop wholesalers became less active, and the market conditions softened by several cents, approaching a dime. Duyang tip rice, on the other hand, did not show excessive fluctuations, and both Yinbian and Yuan rice were seen to be turning fixed.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 35-36 shipments arrived from various routes along the river. The outflow of various goods in the market was average, and the prices of high-quality white 粳 rice and white Yuan rice were firm. Medium and lower grades saw slight price declines of nearly a dime, while Yangdu Bujian rice also showed a softening trend. Early thin rice and Yin Yuan guest tip rice were firm.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Push Peanuts Higher</h3>
<p>Due to the Impending Lunar New Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot transactions of miscellaneous grains were unusually scattered. Total transactions for all grains in the market did not exceed 3,000 bags. For soybeans, two truckloads of Zhengyangguan beans, two truckloads of Yingzhou beans, and one truckload of Bengbu beans were offered, with no price changes. Wholesalers from inland areas and local merchants purchased them. The remaining Niuzhuang red sorghum was offered at 500 bags, priced at $3.02. Kaiyuan corn was offered at 110 bags, priced at $3.05. Nanjing Minglu green beans were offered at 150 bags, priced at $3.47. Tancheng raw red peanuts were offered at 110 bags, priced at $5.10. Shuanggou peanuts were offered at 300 bags, priced at $6.30. Market prices, except for the rising peanuts and the weakening raw kernels, remained generally stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Clearing Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Chaoqing Sugar Opens Lower</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw rising customs gold and standard gold prices, and a slight contraction in Dutch exchange rates, leading to a tighter trend. The association clearing price for 24 grade coarse sand white common goods was $19.70, an increase of $0.10 from the previous day. Transit goods were $6.70, an increase of $0.15 from Tuesday. Dutch red Gao Chen goods were cleared at $16.20, an increase of $0.20. New Gao goods were quoted at $15.85, and new lower-grade goods were cleared at $15.45. Taikoo sugar tightened further yesterday, with quotations up $0.30. B Mark was quoted at $20.30, but no transaction was made. Zhenyu No. 1 reduced white rose another $0.10 to $18.90. Numbers 2, 3, and 4 each retreated $0.20 per grade. Changxing Trading Company continued to offer over 3,000 bags of Zhengmian Dutch white sugar, still at $19.00, but refused to offer further, taking a tight view on the lower market. There were more upper-grade Chaoqing sugar than lower-grade sugar, so market trends varied depending on the quantity. 200 plus bags were offered yesterday, priced at $12.20 to $12.00, and lower-grade sugar was priced at $11.45 to $11.20, down $0.23 to $0.12 from the previous day. Hainan red Xushengji offered over 200 bags, priced at $13.65.</p>

<h3>Year of Peace</h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>The famous prophetic Mrs. Bones has recently, with her insightful prophetic vision, said that</p>
<p>1934 will be a "Year of Peace" with "absolutely no wars." It is inherently as difficult for all prophets to "speak subtly and hit the mark" about world affairs as winning first or second prize in an aviation lottery. However, regarding the "Year of Peace" that Mrs. Bones is spouting nonsense about (whether it is "as if echoing sound" or has no efficacy, the words of any prophet cannot escape the category of "spouting nonsense"), I believe that, apart from our noble nation fundamentally being listed as an exception, there is a degree of objective possibility in the extrapolation of international trends, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, esteemed readers have likely watched at least one or two "National Operas." Those who have watched National Opera will definitely not forget: Whenever "Golden Leopard," "Antian Assembly," "Changban Slope," and other "stage is filled with fire," "heavenly soldiers and generals" "full martial arts" scenes appear, there must be two or three minutes of tranquility on stage, the curtain is lowered, intermittent gongs are struck, and the stagehands clear the tables and chairs, changing the battle scene, clearing space, so that those martial artists can "wrestle barehanded" and "fight with weapons." After these procedures are completed, only then are the gongs and drums beaten loudly, waiting for the generals and soldiers to rush out, point generals, assemble formations, and start fighting... gradually intensifying the performance. The current international stage is also like the stage of our noble nation's national opera, just temporarily quiet to clear the stage before the "full martial arts" are performed. Although international wars are absolutely inevitable, the imperialist powers almost all have something to wait for. Jin Yuan Guo, on the one hand, wants to be busy finding a way to recover from the Blue Eagle Movement, and on the other hand, wants to wait for the completion of the one hundred and one major warship construction plans. Wooden Clog Country must calmly digest Manchuria, and also complete its "emergency time plan" before 1936 in terms of military and political aspects. Other countries such as Britain, France, and Italy are all frantically preparing for war on the one hand, and doing everything possible in diplomatic alliances on the other hand. In addition to this, various conferences to do what humans can are to be held, and "</p>
<p>Peace" is to be advocated. Therefore, judging from the extrapolation of various facts, it is not entirely a fantasy to say that this year can become a "Year of Peace."</p>
<p>Second, if we want to make the "Year of Peace" a "domestic product," I am afraid that there will be very few days possible. Because among our compatriots who like to play with guns and cannons, the warlords in Fujian Province last year killed and slashed a lot, creating a full martial arts performance, eager to play, and this year it seems that the excitement has not subsided, and "continued efforts are still needed." Don't you see Sun Dianying and Ma Hongkui? Now they have the determination to "destroy this dynasty for food" and are doing the opposite work of "Year of Peace." Therefore, apart from a few important people who will again</p>
<p>"go abroad" (Chen Zhenru and Li Renchao will probably have to "go abroad" this year), most of the groups of Adou (foolish sons), mostly will not have the blessing of enjoying the "Year of Peace."</p>
<p>Third, superstitious things like prophecies are most popular in our China, but are rarely seen in the countries of foreign adults. However, the Year of Peace that Mrs. Bones recently spouted nonsense about has caused a sensation in various countries, attracting attention. What is the reason for this? Because humanity's immersion in superstition becomes more profound when faced with turbulent times. When the world is full of waves and disaster lies in ambush everywhere, the encounters and experiences of life often reach the extreme of strangeness and change, and it is extremely difficult to grasp and control them according to one's own will. Thus, many people who run into walls in human affairs and become "monks who are two feet tall and unable to figure things out" unconsciously seek spiritual comfort from the aspect of "destiny" from subjective depression. The increasing popularity of Chinese astrology and the widespread attention drawn by Western prophecies are both for this reason. The imperialists, whose heads are dizzy from war crises and economic panic, also want to think about what "destiny" is like outside of "human affairs."</p>
<p>Although the "Year of Peace" is the advance team of the "Year of Great War," the world, which is deeply worried about war, is happy to hear the prophecy of the "Year of Peace." In that case, Mrs. Bones, in this year of multiple difficulties, is also a "gospel messenger" who temporarily anesthetizes.</p>
<h3>Words on Warming by the Fire</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>On cold days, people cannot avoid warming themselves by the fire. This act of warming by the fire was probably passed down from distant ancestors and existed in ancient times. However, in modern times, with the prosperity of science, the method of heating with steam pipes and water radiators has defeated the "ancient method" of warming by the fire. Although this is a lament for the decline of ancient customs in the sense of preserving national essence, it is also fortunate for the rapid progress in the enjoyment of human happiness. As for the method of warming with steam pipes and water radiators, it can only be enjoyed by a few people in big cities, so let's not talk about it for now. Let's talk about warming by the fire now.</p>
<p>Those who can install a stove at home to warm themselves by the fire are naturally not as wealthy as those who install steam pipes and water radiators at home, but "it is better to be below than above," and warming by the stove is, after all, much warmer than installing a brazier to warm oneself. Those who can install a brazier at home to warm themselves by the fire are naturally not as good as those who install a stove at home, but it can also be said that it is "better to be below than above," and a brazier is still much warmer than freezing without a brazier. This kind of philosophy of life of "it is better to be below than above" is also called "contentment" and "keeping to one's fate," and should be "strictly obeyed." Therefore, I installed a brazier at home, feeling content and living in peace.</p>
<p>But last night, before going to bed, I was greedily reading a beloved book in bed and forgot to extinguish the fire in the brazier. Under the attack of the toxic quality of carbon monoxide, I fell asleep drowsily and did not wake up until lunchtime today. After everyone knocked on the door and shouted loudly, I finally woke up a little like waking up from a dream. I almost suffocated to death in this small room with the windows and doors closed. | This is really because my fate is still good and my luck has not declined | At the same time, I saw in today's newspaper that a certain family's nanny died of suffocation from warming by the fire in a small room, which made me break out in a cold sweat. Because of my own near suffocation and the stimulus of knowing that someone had really suffocated to death from the newspaper report, I was temporarily blinded by greed and imagined that if everyone could enjoy steam pipes and water radiators ... Of course, this is a non-divisional thought, but in fact, this thought is not illegal. How can it be said that it is not illegal? The prosperity of science and the result of the shift of the times naturally lead to the electrification of cities progressing to the electrification of rural areas. Where electrification has already occurred, steam pipes and water radiators can naturally be installed for heating, but this era of electrification in both cities and rural areas is far, far away.</p>
<p>However, today's newspaper published a news item similar to a commentary called "Development of Home Electrification," saying, "For electricity, factories, transportation, and traffic, everyone is amazed by its wide use and its grand effect. However, in modern times, with the prosperity of science, the use of electricity... therefore, there is the realization of home electrification... Today, there are no less than tens of millions of such families being built, and it can be asserted that in the future, it will increase to hundreds of millions." Then, the era of "home electrification" that "will increase to hundreds of millions in the future" and is "assertable" is not too far away.</p>
<h3>Winter Tonics</h3>
<p>— Bao Xu</p>
<p>Once it's winter, the newspapers are filled with advertisements from pharmacies, saying that winter is the best time to take tonics, and everyone should take some tonics, which can eliminate diseases, prolong life, nourish Yang, and benefit longevity.</p>
<p>Of course, in these years, the national fortune is declining day by day. If everyone can take some tonics and everyone can eliminate diseases, prolong life, nourish Yang, and benefit longevity, this will have an indirect impact on the future of our nation, not to mention that our own bodies can be very strong, and if we have children, then our future children, because of heredity, will naturally all be as strong as us. Then, even if we are destroyed by the enemy, are we still afraid that our own children will always have a day to retaliate for this "irreconcilable" hatred? At that time, let us wait and see! I am afraid that those neighboring countries will say "the Yellow Peril" is coming again!</p>
<p>Therefore, there is really no difference between Chinese and Western culture. Although Hitler in Germany is now promoting eugenics and heredity, in China, we are also promoting it. However, there is some difference in the method. The Germans rule the world with "hegemony," while we Chinese rule the world with "benevolence." The only difference is in this!</p>
<p>Therefore, the appearance of tonics in such years, if we think about it with a little logic, who can say that it is not appropriate? I therefore look in the mirror every day to see my own face, feeling that it is almost getting yellower and thinner day by day, and I also quite want to take some tonics to replenish myself, and a few friends who care about me also advise me on this when they meet me. Those friends who understand Western medicine say, "You must get some blood-replenishing injections to make your body strong!" Those friends who understand Chinese medicine say, "You must eat some ginseng or deer antler to make your body strong!" And myself, after hearing their words, I can only respond with a smile.</p>
<p>Naturally, I thank them all for their kindness. Whether they advise me to get blood-replenishing injections or eat ginseng or deer antler, although the methods are different, the principle of replenishment is always the same, right?</p>
<p>However, at this winter season, people like me, or people who are not as good as me, the things they are worried about every day are not about the internal replenishment of the body, but about the external clothing of the body. "The whole family is in the wind, and the clothes for September have not been cut," this line of poetry coughed up from free blood, at this winter season, is it not protesting to the season for many people?</p>
<p>The reason why I smiled it off is right here.</p>

<h3>Manli's Freedom (7)</h3>
<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>He enjoyed reading newspapers, treating it as a kind of work.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say before that not reading newspapers calms the mind, but reading newspapers makes one crazy? Why do you enjoy</p>
<p>reading newspapers now?" I asked him this way.</p>
<p>"The previous concept was wrong. The more evil society is, the more we should face the evil of society. Newspapers tell us the evils of society, and we should study the root causes of the evils of society to see if the theory matches the facts, and then we can move forward to achieve success in theory and practice." He answered calmly like that.</p>
<p>He not only didn't drink alcohol, but he also didn't smoke cigarettes! The Jai Alai court was even more like a relic of the previous century to him.</p>
<p>Apart from teaching classes, he stayed at home reading books, writing manuscripts, or meeting guests and chatting. It was rare to see him go out, although you might still find him taking a walk in the park after dinner.</p>
<p>I occasionally asked him, "What about Manli?"</p>
<p>He just shook his head with a smile on his painful expression.</p>
<p>I regretted that I shouldn't have brought up his personal affairs and uncovered his wounds. I was afraid he would go crazy again, so I quickly changed the subject and talked to him about the weather being too cold that day. However, in my heart, I was asking myself, "He shook his head, what does that mean? Does it mean it's over? Does it mean he's already not thinking about it anymore?" I replied to myself in this way, "His heart has been bitten by the poisonous snake of sorrow, and even his heart is numb."</p>
<p>The second time I went to look for him, he disappeared!</p>
<p>Don't worry, listen to me tell you.</p>
<p>I went to look for him the day after he disappeared. As soon as I entered the door, your servant Ou asked me anxiously and busily,</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, have you seen Mr. Tang?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He, he left the house yesterday and hasn't come home!"</p>
<p>"Hasn't come home?" I was shocked.</p>
<p>"Yes, hasn't come home. Usually, he doesn't leave the house all day on Monday, which I found strange</p>
<p>, unexpectedly, he still hasn't come home today!"</p>
<p>"Did he take anything with him?"</p>
<p>"No, he just left wearing an old cotton robe, without even changing out of his suit!"</p>
<p>He liked to wear that old cotton robe at home, saying that it was warmer than a suit, which I had seen, but he always changed into a suit before leaving the house, so why did he leave wearing that old cotton robe, and why hasn't he come home even now</p>
<p>? | I immediately became uneasy in my heart.</p>
<p>I called every place where his friends were to ask... they all said he hadn't come.</p>
<p>I told them all about his disappearance. Before long, his friends all came to your house.</p>
<p>Everyone kept questioning your servant Ou, but the servant Ou could only... a few... (the words are missing after that) ... Afterwards, he resigned and disappeared.</p>

<h3>Literary Figures Value the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>England and America Face Each Other Across the Ocean</p>
<p>Works of Equal Stature are Together Adapted for the Silver Screen</p>
<p>Regarding England: The British film industry, which closely follows America's Hollywood, has recently produced works that show a trend of surpassing it. Moreover, many Hollywood stars have been courted by the British film industry, with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Jr. being the most notable. Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. has decided to produce films of the "Robin Hood" type in London, England, while Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is currently filming "Catherine the Great". Catherine was a famous Russian monarch in European history, and she authored a "History of Russia". The British literary figure and idealist H.G. Wells caused a sensation in Europe and America with his "Outline of History", which has also been translated in our country. Wells' ideal work, "The Shape of Things to Come", has been acquired by a London film company for adaptation into a film. Wells pays close attention to the film industry and has recently been visiting various British film companies. The figure (A) shows him visiting the set while Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is filming. The second person from the right is Wells, and the last person on the left is director Paul Czinner.</p>
<p>Regarding America: The German Emil Ludwig, famous for his biographies of historical figures such as "Napoleon", "Bismarck", "Goethe", and "Lincoln", recently had his masterpiece "Napoleon" acquired for filming by MGM, who hired him as a consultant for the film. Although Ludwig is a world-renowned biographer, he is very interested in film and has met many film industry figures during his visit to Hollywood, among whom Charlie Chaplin is the most highly regarded. He says that Chaplin's life story is enough material for him to write a biography, but he believes that Chaplin's personality is extremely complex, and he needs sufficient time to fully understand his dynamic character. Finally, Ludwig visited United Artists, the company to which Chaplin belongs, and happened to meet the comedic star Eddie Cantor and a group of United Artists executives. The figure (B) shows the scene taken at the United Artists studio, with the person standing to Ludwig's right being Darryl F. Zanuck, the producer of "42nd Street" and "Gold Diggers" from Warner Bros.</p>

<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Bombshell"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>When film artists lack good material, they depict their own lives. This may be because the general public is very envious of the private lives of stars, so these sketches of star private lives have become fragrant bait for fishing. The audience's foreign coins and banknotes fill the pockets of the producers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, film artists using their own lives as the object of depiction is like novelists writing novels centered on novelists. It will certainly be more authentic because it is depicting oneself. As for film entrepreneurs selling the secrets of the studio, it is ultimately a</p>
<p>pathetic and laughable method of last resort.</p>
<p>"Bombshell", like last year's "Hollywood on Parade", is a record of the lives of stars. As mentioned above, this kind of record is indeed written very authentically.</p>
<p>An actress becomes a famous star due to the promotion of the company's publicity manager. As a result, her life becomes luxurious and comfortable. Many men pursue her. Her every move becomes the best material for newspapers. At this time, she does not refuse to associate with the person who promotes her and must also deal with the director. At the same time, because of the rascality of her father and brother, she tries to cover up all the ugly things. Like old-fashioned parents who do not want their sons to marry ugly female stars, so-called true love seems to have nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>These should be true depictions of their private lives. However, the screenwriter cleverly wrote the publicity manager, played by Lee Tracy, as a master of seduction, and said that the reason why noble sons cannot marry female stars is entirely due to his cunning manipulation, as if to explain that there is nothing between them. In fact, we feel that it is unnecessary. Anyway, the ugly society teaches people to live in ugliness. Everything is not a superficial moral issue that can explain all social phenomena, are our subjects, but when we choose subjects, we must strictly use good subjects. We certainly do not agree with the author using the method of makeup to cover up the truth, and they even intersperse this subject into a light and boring story of seduction, which is even more unacceptable to us. However, here, we can see the American casual and happy style.</p>
<p>In terms of being carefree and happy, not only are Lee Tracy and Jean Harlow the most suitable actors, but the director is also a master of this. He writes Jean Harlow as a typical American movie star, not only starting from powdering and applying lipstick, but also depicting the scene where a maid leads three dogs entangled around her, which is even more profound and detailed. As for Lee Tracy, with his eloquent specialty, playing a clever, lively, and brazen role, he also has special success. Since films such as "Moscow Nights" and "The Mayor of Hell", his nonsense skills will not be forgotten. In addition, Frank Morgan also performed very well.</p>
<p>As for the expensive sets and clear sound, they are originally the characteristics of American films. People who intend to be entertained may as well have a happy time.</p>
<h3>Gary Cooper Loses and Regains Love</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw Mr. Donglin's "Gary Cooper's Broken Heart" news in the Shen Bao Film Supplement. I felt that the text was a bit of a hindsight, because while he was talking about Gary Cooper's broken heart, Gary Cooper had already found his lover and was already engaged to her. That lucky woman is called Sandra Shaw. She was originally a famous New York socialite, originally named Veronica Balfe. She has an uncle named Cedric Gibbons, who is a producer in Hollywood, and his wife is Dolores del Río, the star of "Bird of Paradise". A year ago, Sandra came to Hollywood to visit her uncle, and Dolores held a grand banquet for her to entertain guests. Many producers saw her at the banquet and were amazed by her beauty, and they all asked her to act in movies. She first signed a six-month contract with RKO, and later transferred to Goldwyn. Although she is a newcomer to the film industry and lacks experience, she cannot play major roles, but her bright future is guaranteed by everyone. Unexpectedly, she later met Gary Cooper and fell in love at first sight, willing to give up her career as a star and marry a film person. Not long ago, she had already agreed with Gary Cooper to return to New York to meet her future parents-in-law, and it is expected that they will soon become a loving couple.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gary Cooper's parents were extremely opposed to all his previous romances, such as with Clara Bow and Lupe Vélez, etc., but now they are very much in favor of this Sandra Shaw, and they say that Miss Shaw will definitely be a good wife and mother in the future, so the two elders are very happy to have a good son and daughter-in-law.</p>
<h3>Family Harmony Also Needs to be Declared in the Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>It is common to publish marriage announcements in the newspaper, and it is also common to publish divorce announcements. But it is strange to publish something in the newspaper that is neither a marriage nor a divorce. Recently, Hollywood stars Neil Hamilton and his wife, because of rumors that they would soon divorce, posted an announcement in a newspaper saying: "Mr. and Mrs. Neil Hamilton hereby solemnly declare that they</p>
<p>have been married for eleven years, and their relationship has always been very deep. Although there have been various rumors in the outside world, which have been published in this newspaper and all other newspapers, and there have been various hearsay rumors: slander and gossip, which are quite terrible. We hereby inform the public that the past eleven years have been harmonious and seamless: and countless eleven years to come will continue in the same way, without change," etc. From the above advertisement, it can also be seen that Hollywood is shaken by the divorce trend, so that the families of ordinary people are shaken by it.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Broadway Thru a Keyhole (6)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Clark asked her to dance, and she was even more flattered and flustered. She spun on the smooth floor to the soft music of the foxtrot; she wanted to close her eyes and have an endless beautiful dream, she was running in the clouds illuminated by the moonlight, she was relying on only a handsome man's arms, embracing her waist very securely. Soon, the night came to an end, and Clark came to see her again the next day, and came to see her every day. They swam together by the sea, galloped together in the wilderness, and lay drunk and dreamy in the cool shade of the palm trees. When the sun and moon were dim and only the stars were shining in the sky, they were still wandering on the beach. It was on such a night that Clark first pulled Joan Holland into his arms, and for the first time his lips met hers. When he hugged her tightly, she did not resist at all, and she simply closed her eyes and enjoyed the unrestrained, passionate kiss of the person she had long loved.</p>
<p>It was late at night when she hurriedly returned to the hotel. In the hallway of the hotel, there happened to be a member of Locky's gang, whom Joan originally knew, but because Joan arrogantly ignored him, he held a grudge and immediately sent a telegram to Chuck, telling him to report all of Joan Holland's actions to Locky. Five minutes later, Locky made a long-distance call, ordering Joan Holland to return to New York immediately. Joan returned to New York, where Locky and Chuck greeted her at the station and immediately took her to her apartment. When Joan arrived at the apartment, she took off her coat, and Locky immediately questioned her about the affairs in Erie. Joan initially wanted to hide it, but then Locky said Clark Brian's name and asked what was going on. He said, "It's not that I don't trust you, but I must know my own position. I have always taken care of you first, and you know it yourself. You say that I treat you so well, that's all my own willingness, there's no need to mention it. You don't owe me anything either. Just knowing you is already my reward. But if you want any changes, why not tell us and we can discuss it." Joan was afraid that something would be unfavorable to Clark, and in the end, she did not dare to tell him the truth, only saying, "Don't you know my heart?" Locky then picked her up and kissed her passionately. On the one hand, she did not dare to disobey Locky, and on the other hand, she felt sorry for Clark.</p>
<p>Soon after Joan Holland returned to New York, she saw a small news item in the newspaper saying that Clark Brian had been sued by the manager of a dance hall in Erie for breaking the contract and demanded compensation of $100,000. When she saw this news, she felt as if a great disaster was coming and became uneasy. One night, after her performance, she was about to remove her makeup in the dressing room when suddenly there was a knock on the door. She thought it was Locky, so she shouted, "Come in." But the person she saw coming in the mirror was not Locky, but Clark Brian. She floated around and was hugged by Clark. For a moment, she forgot everything, only Clark's fiery hot kiss. She whispered, "Oh, Clark, I missed you so much. Hold me tighter so I can feel that you really came. I will never let you leave me again." After Clark hugged her tightly, she suddenly shivered and quickly pushed him away, staring at him and saying, "How did you come? What if Locky finds out?" (To be continued)</p>
