<p>再觀兩地收回之實况更難使吾人遽抱樂觀不惟當地之僞滿機關如郵局稅關等皆未迅卽消滅儼然與我分庭抗禮卽號稱歸還之行政權與警察權亦橫遭剥奪殊不足以言金甌無缺我方駐榆警察迄今仍持木棒站崗以視僞警全副武裝每日趾高氣揚招掏過市不能不令人有喧賓奪主之感此事雖由陶尙銘氏迭次交涉而日方祇允華警配置短劍手銃絕對不得參用大槍手銃亦祇限五十枝當地甫經接收日鮮浪人滋擾堪虞區區手銃五十枝以言維持治安尙嫌不足防止匪患更無所恃我方駐古北口之警察保安隊人數及槍枝等日方亦要求有所限制意在不得超過五百人站崗警察且不得携帶槍枝推測日方心理殆欲限制我方維持治安之實力間接養成匪患以留其隨時干涉之餘地且聞榆關日本浪人及日本憲兵隊終日出入於公安局縣政府中調查我方措施我方雖不勝其煩而無法拒絕由此種種皆可窺見日人居心之一斑吾人愼勿徒震交還之美外而遽以爲滿足也</p>

<p>日本自佔我東北四省後其對華政策顯有變遷之必要蓋前乎此其目的首在囊括東北之資源與主權後乎此則首在奪取關内之市塲今佔領東北之目的旣逹華人排日風潮亦漸歸平靜爲日人計自應避免軍事行動而培養我關内市塲之購買力以爲日貨傾銷之尾閭矧日本之國際外交早陷孤立無援地位如不在華竭力縮小其武裝行動之範圍則必將促成各方應付公敵之聯合戰線而日瀕危殆之境廣田新外相關於外交方針之演說有云「中國速復其治安與繁榮乃帝國衷心所希望」其意殆欲一方打開外交之出路一方挽回中國之市塲雙管齊下面面俱到確爲其内在心理之表現</p>
<p>日方渴望關内外通車通郵等問題早日解决過去數月且時時慫恿我方與僞滿直接商洽使我在事實上承認僞國爲其他各國逐一承認之先導幸我方態度堅决雖有初次之接洽而卒歸停頓最近日方因輸關與古北口旣已交還認爲通車通郵等事件已有賡續談判之可能</p>

<p>（東京）　外務省雖命駐莫斯科日大使抗議蘇俄飛機飛過韓邊界之行動、但陸軍省不甚重視此事、又據陸軍省發言人語路透訪員、俄兵開槍射撃日飛機事、陸軍省亦不重視之、蓋司機關槍之兵士或誤認日飛機越過邊界、故開槍射撃之也、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　聞諸可恃方面、英日紡織業之談判、現已臻甚複雜之階段、但英代表否認討論業已中止之說、聞雙方將集議於商部、而努力謀取出路、日代表團頻與東京接洽、而英代表已曾開秘會數次、討論所爭各點、如談判果破裂、則在英人市塲中抵制日貨競爭之呼聲、勢將愈高、而此事或將由外交方面辦理之、（廿八日路透電）</p>

<h3>復辟謠諑蠭起奧大利政局不安</h3>
<p>寓比沃都大公活動</p>
<p>法捷反對王室復權</p>
<p>維也納　過去三十六小時内、奧國謠諑蠭起、或謂復辟在卽、或謂有人陰謀暗殺副總理費氏、所謂奧國國社黨監督哈璧赫前在播音演說中對奧總理杜爾夫斯博士所發之哀的美敦書、將於今日滿期、故大局殊形不安、而外方干涉之恐慌、更爲復辟之消息增其糾紛、據傳、維也納與不魯塞爾附近某邸（卽自稱奧國未來君主沃都大公之寓所）間近時有機密消息互相來往、路透電社不魯塞爾訪員曾傳出關於此事之消息、謂邇來沃都大公邸異常活動、但據該邸所發表之正式文告聲稱、大公不欲赴奧國云、</p>

<p>抱維持奧國獨立决心</p>
<p>國社主義固深所贊同</p>
<p>但内政不願受人控制</p>
<p>不輕言復辟恐引起隣國反感</p>
<p>維也納　史泰漢堡極力否認内衛團與陶爾斐斯政府間發生意見之謠言、據稱、吾人計畫在與奧總理密切合作下、實現吾人之進行程序、吾人無意採用武力或其他不忠於國之計畫、吾人現决定以忠誠與奧總理杜爾夫斯全合作、吾人對之、有絕對之信仰、所有謠言、皆係某方有意散佈云云、（廿八日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納　史仄漢堡今日答報界代表之問話、謂内衛團主張立卽取銷排斥哈浦斯堡王室寓奧之法律、但復辟問題、此時尙不能草草作答、該問題非純爲奧國之事務、且涉及鄰邦之前途、故奧國不能貿然提出也、至於舉一攝政王者、則因奧國意法無此規定、碍難實行、内衛團深知奧國赤化份子軍火充足、故劇烈之衝突、恐終不能免、惟顯明之障碍旣經掃除、當前急務爲效忠於困苦之國民、史氏又述及國社主羲、謂内衛團對於德國國家主羲與汎德主羲、甚爲贊同、但欲貫澈此種主義、最佳之方法厥爲維持奧國之獨立耳、吾人殊歡迎與德恢復友交、但不願以奧國内政、受國社主義之控制而易得之云、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>星期後、渠將重作其仇視奧政府之活動、此種言論、直同哀的美敦書、今午限期已滿、奧國頗形惶慮、蓋以奧總理杜爾夫斯已切實拒絕其合作之要求也、現尙未有何事變、但警察已凖備一切、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>意軍八千駐防奧邊</h3>
<p>維也納　現悉最近奧國社會黨叛亂時、曾有意大利軍隊八千人進駐巴都亞、凖備在緊急時馳往奧國邊境、聞當局雖未决定採取若何必要辦法、但該項軍隊已充分凖備對付任何事變（廿八日路透電）</p>
<h3>邊界衝突謠言稽</h3>
<p>奧德邊界發生事端之謠言、已由奧總理杜爾夫斯對維也納路透訪員聲明皆屬無稽之談、據稱、奧國一切安謐、今正戒備、以防邊界發生事變、又稱、奧政府並未派兵開往捷克邊界、僅命輔助軍數隊開至上奧地利亞、以維持該處公安云、（路透）</p>
<h3>意奧匈締經濟同盟</h3>
<p>係經法國之贊同</p>

<p>維也納　外傳法國對於意奧匃三國議訂經濟同盟、將有所舉動、又謂奧軍與内衛團現正調往德奧邊界、以防二月二十八日以後發生意外事變云云、茲由政府公報局發表文告、加以否認、據謂奧國輿意匃所討論者、並未涉及關稅同盟問題、僅求依照一九三二年十月間斯特萊隆會議所商定、而經法國贊同之决議成立三國間之密切經濟合作、而根據優待稅則締結分配之恊定云、（廿八日國民電）</p>

<h3>法報不信奧將復辟</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　此間外交界對奧國哈布斯堡皇室復辟之消息、頗爲懹疑、感認爲係報紙傳聞、不足徵信、故亦不願加以評論、惟謂復辟之事、除引起政治上困難以外、並與奧匃兩國政府對列强所作之諾言相反、緣一九二零年二月四日與一九二一年四月一日各國大使會議、曾兩次照會奧匃政府、謂哈布斯堡皇室之復辟、將視爲與和平條約之根本相反、同盟各國不獨不能承認、且並不能容忍、當時奧匃兩國曾復文承認遵守各國之警告、至於匃牙利則自查理士王復辟失敗之後、亦允許不再如此項嘗試、其諾言尤爲正式云、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>滇人對英兵侵佔班洪之主張</h3>
<p>民衆外交後援會發表宣言</p>
<p>公佈班洪劃界交涉之經過</p>
<p>昆明通信、英兵日前由緬侵入滇邊後、形勢極爲緊張、頃雲南民衆外交後援會、對於此案發表宣言、原文如下、</p>
<p>「吾國不幸、變亂迭乘、内訌相繼、外侮日臻、自「九一八」後、東北淪陷、國力不競、失地未復、言之痛心、吾汁與强隣接壤、其危殆情勢、實不亞於東北、有識者咸惄怒然憂之、於是組織救國會、募集救國基金、力謀建設邊防、用固吾圉、而杜覬觎、此亦吾滇民衆救國之唯一途徑也、乃方事綢繆、警耗傳來、英帝國主羲者、竟不顧公理、蔑視約章、乘吾國家多事不遑不遑顧及邊陲之際、重施强佔片馬之故技、派兵據我班洪、實逼處此、寗能坐視、吾滇民衆、爲保全領土計、爲維護國權計、不能不一致奮起、誓與帝國主義者相周旋、以盡人民愛國之天職、爰聯合各團體、組織雲南民衆外交後援會、羣策羣力、藉作政府後盾、</p>
<p>查班洪爲我領土、富有五金各鑛、英人垂涎、爲日已久、前此所以逡巡遲徊者、徒以葫蘆王内向情殷、不受籠絡、近則圖窮七見、利用漢奸、遂不惜明目張膽、憑藉武力、肆行侵据、（後附班洪槪况節略、藉明眞象）竊班洪地雖一隅、關係吾國之領土主權、實重且鉅、應付之方、惟有懇請政府、嚴重抗議、據理力爭、責令英兵先行撤退、並停止英緬人等在該地之一切活動、免致發生意外、釀成重大糾紛、而永久之根本解决辦法、則在懇請政府、速與英人勘界、蓋能勘界、則拖角問題、片馬問題、班洪問題、移椿問題、私椿問題、以及已定界未定界之一切未了問題、均可得一總解决、否則英人之陰柔蠶食、其禂不亞於日人之强暴鯨吞、蓋旣得拖角、乃進而佔片馬、得片馬、進而佔班洪、若得班、則將進而據迤西各縣、不出十年、吾滇或將爲東北之續、言念及此、不寒而慄、故吾滇民衆、應認定以勘界爲解决糾紛防止侵略之唯一方法、努力將事、期其實現、並望全國民衆、起而援助、滇省政府與中央政府、尤應通力恊作、切實交涉、非逹到勘界目的、决不中止、此爲本會揭　之第一義、</p>
<p>班洪雖爲吾國領土、然距省治窵遠、久已視若蠻荒、益以頻年多故、未克着意經營、故關於該地一切情形、多屬糢糊、折衝樽俎、輒被蒙混、今欲與英人交涉劃勘、非先從事調查不爲功、否則不知彼、並不知已、無論交涉少所憑依、卽使正義伸張、物歸故主、恐亦無從開發建設、故吾滇民衆、應速組織視察團、實地從事於調查工作、庶能有裨外交、並爲他日建設張本、一舉兩得、莫善於此、此爲本會揭　之第二羲、</p>
<p>凡此二羲、望我滇人、脚踏實地、埋頭做去、繼續努力、持之以恒、勿懾於英人威勢、而存畏葸之心、勿激於一時憤怒、而越逾珔軌、勿事過卽忘、致貽五分鐘熱度之譏、勿秦越相視、致遭一盤散沙之消、庶乎領土可保、國權能張也、顧亭林之言曰、「天下興亡、匹夫有責」、子輿氏之言曰、「國必自伐、而後人伐之」、何去何從、是在吾人之自擇自勉而已、謹此宣言、諸希公鑒、」</p>

<h3>桂省經濟調查印象記（五）千家駒</h3>
<p>不過在另一方面、公路的開發、却也不是没有牠的反作用的、牠影響於廣西全省經濟地位的、第一·就是促進廣西對外貿、易入超問題的嚴重化、公路築好了、汽車和汽油是不得不仰給於國外的、這我們祇要一看廣西海關的報告册、汽車之輸入始自民九、爲值不過八·九一八海關兩、至民十七年、突躍至二二三·○一九海關兩、十八年一二九·四六○關兩、二十年二五·七○二關兩、汽油之輸入、民十五年尙不過一五三·三九三加崙、值五四·二一八關兩、民十八年突增至四四九·四一二加崙、值二○六·四七一關兩、二十年爲三六三·一五六加崙、值二三三·七一三海關兩、汽車與汽油輸入巨額的增加、無疑地是促使桂省漏巵增加的、第二·公路在運輸交通上的意義、是不能與鐵道或輪船相提並論的、現在廣西所使用的汽車、載重量大率在二噸２半以下、除便利行旅外、不但於運輸農産品上一無用處、就連運輸商品、也作用甚小、因爲運費太貴、與不能載大量物品的緣故、所以除少數物品如煙土洋紗等可由公路運輸外、其他的商品、是不能享公路之利的、第三·牠加深了政府與人民间的隔閡、廣西的公路建築、有三種股本、一爲田股、卽凡公路所經過之處、按值没收人民田産、作爲股本、但所謂「股票」、多未發給、而田賦依舊負担、二爲工股、卽徵發民伕築路、名義上是說給四角錢一天、但事實上往往僅發一二角伙食費、餘二角作爲工股、三爲路股、卽商股、名雖商民自由捐輸、實帶强迫勸募之意、由此可知公路是完全由人民的金錢與法血築起來的、但自公路築成後、農民之牛車馬車、反不許通行、（因其易有損壤路面）他們反因此而失去了固有的運輸工具、農民是坐不起汽車的、坐車的多爲稍有資産者或公務人員、每當車輛一過、塵土萬丈、躱避稍緩、叱駡立至、當我們坐在車上、每看到農民那副敢怒而不敢言的苦臉、總覺得異常的難過、此外、廣西還有一種特殊現象、爲他省之所不經見者、卽汽車夫生活之奢侈與氣燄之嚣張、他們每月的收入、比普通一個縣長還要豐裕、廣西縣長俸給通常爲毫洋百四十元、但普通一個汽車夫的收入、最少爲八十元、多有至二百元者、（俸金亦不過四五十元但額外收入極豐）、汽車夫特殊地位之所以養成、一方面是由於大規模公路建設後、司機求過於供、再則因廣西素無此項人材之訓練、不得不到廣州去召請、物以稀爲貴、一到邊僻的廣西、他們自然要夜郎自大、對待顧客或老百姓、都以太上皇自居了、關於這種情形、我們曾有一次和黃主席談過、黃主席說他們也早有所聞、現正想辦司機人員養成所、招考初中畢業學生、加以訓練、果能亭樣、我們認爲是最有效的辦法了、</p>
<p>公路在經濟上、雖不及鐵道來得重要、但在交通上和軍事上、却自有其存在的價值的、補救公路在運輸上的缺點、我們以爲第一·應該准許農民牛車及馬車的通行、惟爲避免損壤路面計、不妨規定牛車車輪應有的寛度或尺寸、或者輪子上包以膠皮、近年來膠皮的價格正一落千丈、如由政府大批購買進來、轉售給農民、我們深信農家是可以負担得起的、第二·政府可多購買載重汽車、現在美國的貨車載重量、竟有逹十噸的、這在目前廣西鬆軟的沙土路面、自然弗克勝任、但如略將路面及橋梁改良、用四五噸的載重車、當不至於陷下、建設廳不妨以養路費收入、多購買此種貨車、以爲商品運輸之用、運費尤宜公允低廉、以减輕商品的成本、如果這二層實行後、公路就不會像現在這樣「僅便行旅」了、</p>

<h3>開發新省</h3>
<p>中央對於開發西北問題、業已分頭進行、西北各省地廣人稀、而礦産富饒、已爲人所共悉、故開發西北、卽爲我國惟一之出路、新疆地處西邊、地廣藏富、甲於其他各省、國人之關心於國事者、已先後分赴該地考察、均認新疆之開發、爲刻不容緩、行政院汪院長有鑒於此、卽命本人籌備新疆建設計畫委員會事宜、受命後、卽分函各院部選聘熟悉該省情形者充任委員、現已聘任李景樅·唐柯三·等二十五人爲委員、李唐等對於新疆情形知之較詳、故對於計議新疆建設、當能各抒所見、現已定下週内、在京舉行首次會議、以後當每週或二週開會一次、將所得貢諸各主管機關、盡量進行、該會係隸於行政院、會議由本人召集、其所討論之問題、以建設爲限、如發展新省交通·開發礦産·施行敎育·等等、至於政治問題、亦將加以研究、該省戰事、現未有正式報告、南疆喀什噶爾之情形、中央方面、迄今尙未得可靠報告、因交通不便、電訊艱難、各報所載消息、盡係外電、其中所傳、難免不有相當作用、所以對於新省交通之建設、更爲惟一要務、實不容片刻稍緩也、</p>

<h3>中外重視提高銀價</h3>
<p>羅斯福電令滬總領查覆</p>
<p>外僑公會電羅主張愼重</p>
<p>國際貿易局謂與我不利</p>
<p>自本市銀行公會電美總統羅斯福氏、抗議提高銀價政策、以該電並未經由外交方式送逹、羅氏亦無覆電、惟據可靠消息、羅氏對此、確已極端重視、並分電美國商務機關調查、同時本埠外僑公會、亦電羅氏、請其愼重處理、茲將各情分誌於次</p>
<h3>參赞領事奉令調查</h3>
<p>羅斯福自接本市銀行公會抗議電文、表示提高銀價、對於我國將蒙不利後、昨已分電廣東路三號美國商務參贊安諾爾·裘廉·及總領事克寗瀚·調查我國金融狀况、物價指數、商務實情、將來實施銀價提高政策後、對於中國究竟有無弊害、該總領及參贊等接電後、已製定表格、分飭專門人員、向各有關係機關及中外銀行、詳密調查、安諾爾與克寗瀚二氏、對於中國情形、非常熟悉、美人視爲「中國通」、羅斯福對於二氏之報告、極爲重視、大約美提高銀價標凖及步驟、須俟二氏報告到美、加以研究後、始能决定、</p>
<h3>外僑電羅主張愼重</h3>
<p>大陸報云、上海外僑公會、上星期五日、開總務委員會會議、議决電致羅斯福總統、請其愼重考慮美國國會議立白銀法制所及於中國之影響、該電已於昨晚（二十七）拍出、文曰、「上海外僑工會計有十二國之代表、敬請閣下考慮所議白銀任何法制所及於中國之影響、吾人以爲此項法制、宜以關於美國之銀價爲限、而不可牽及世界銀價、中國繁榮所必要者、端賴銀價必須依一般物價之漲高而增進、中國因銀價低廉、得免受世界經濟厄運之重大影響、而其他各國、因用高價圓幣單位、致獲有害之結果、乃以减低蹩值爲補救之計、對華輸入、必須以其輸出或對華之放欵抵付否則中國白銀將源源流出、銀價之漲高、將使地價與貨價一落千丈、而有禁止白銀出口或徵收白銀出口稅之必要、則中國勢將處於受管理的圓幣基礎矣、此電昨夜始發出、故尙未接有覆電、</p>
<h3>林康侯談悉聽政府</h3>
<p>據南京電傳、有中政會已通過、批准銀恊定消息、申時社記者、當卽趨訪銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏、叩詢對於批准恊定之意見、據林氏談、銀行公會前曾電致中央、請暫緩批准銀恊定、此係銀行界同業之意見、惟採納與否、悉聽政府自主、銀行界並無意見可以發表、惟政府一面旣已批准恊定、一面對於美方將來提高銀價時、自必有妥善之對策、吾人現祇有靜觀美方政策之推移、隨時再定應付之方針云、</p>
<h3>去年現銀出口大增</h3>
<p>昨據國際貿易局發表、我國爲用銀國家、銀之對於我國不啻爲人生命脈、茲美總統羅斯福以施行貨幣政策使美元價格低落、銀價提高、此種政策、對於我國白銀頗有逐漸流出之危機、我國頻年以來、農村破産、物價低落、外貨充斥市塲、入超年增一年、白銀流出、不知凡幾、按海關報告、民國二十一年、我國輸出現銀價值爲國幣五七、六四五、四九一元、至去年已增至九四、二八八、九三六元之鉅、其中出口美國者約占全數百分之七十以上、若此番美國政策實行、於吾國民生計經濟、將更不利、其入超與白銀輸出、將更可觀、茲將兩年來我國現銀出口各國統計如下、</p>

<h3>匯豐銀行年會討論</h3>
<p>字林報云、匯豐銀行於上星期六日、在香港舉行股東年會時、主席丕爾斯之演說中、曾涉及銀問題、謂三年之前、諸君之主席、述及白銀地位時、曾希望有關係各政府、停止足使地位惡化之任何計畫、吾人今仍抱此意見、以爲就中國而論、志在以人爲的方法、提高銀價之政府的干涉、或可必其有害無益、職是之故、吾人對倫敦世界經濟會議所訂之白銀恊定、不加贊許、此舉樹一希圖管理白銀供給之前例、雖因涉及之數額、比較尙小、故其及於銀價之影響、亦殊微細、今後似仍將如是、但旣訂成國際恊定、規定人爲的市塲、限制供求之自由運行、殊足鼓勵白銀之投機家也、全世界幣價之低落、已使銀價與各種圓幣相比而漲高、同時中國出口貨價、亦隨以高起、中國漸須輸出白銀、以付其輸入品之貨欵、此實不祥之兆、吾人試略觀下列數字、更可明瞭其地位、溯一九三零年底止以前之七年内、印度與中國平均、共約銷費世界所供白銀百分之六十六、卽每年約二萬萬盎司是也、一九三一年銷費數落至一萬一千六百萬盎司、一九三二年落至五千二百萬盎司、一九三三年印度銷費約爲一千萬盎司、中國則白銀輸出之數、超過輸入數一千五百萬盎司、由此可見向來銷費世界白銀供給三分之二者、今已離開白銀市塲矣、雖世界白銀産額、已由平均每年約二萬四千萬盎司落至一萬六千三百萬盎司、而上年所供給之總數、仍多至二萬七千三百萬盎司、此較過去七年中平均之供給、並未多减、故白銀供給、今有一萬五千萬盎司以上、仍無人過問、大約悉在投機家手中也、余意、諸君當深知目前不穏定之狀態、實由有突然採行政府計畫之可能性所造成、蓋此舉可使局勢一宿全變、而使商家陷於甚困難之地位、且使經營匯兌業之銀行家、大增其累也云云、</p>

<h3>法女飛行家希爾滋昨晚未到滬</h3>
<p>昨晨由港出發沿途天氣惡劣</p>
<p>法領事署昨卽分電各處查詢</p>
<p>昨晚始悉遇霧折回汕頭降落</p>
<p>法國女飛行家希爾滋女士、此次駕愛西班諾瑞士廠所造之飛機、作第二次巴黎與東京間橫斷飛行、途中慺受挫折、其志不衰、前日由河内飛抵香港、卽於昨晨出發來滬、預定昨日下午一時許可抵此、但截至昨晚止、音信杳然、各方頗關心女士安、</p>
<p>全、晚得確訊、因遇霧在汕頭降落、人心始安、茲分誌各情於後、</p>
<h3>飛機式樣</h3>
<p>此次希爾滋女士所駕飛機、較上次來華飛機爲大、該機係愛西班諾瑞士（按譯意爲西瑞公司）飛機廠出品之三百三十號布來歸脫（Ｂｒｅｇｕｅｔ）陸路行頗機、有六百五十匹馬力之發動機、飛行頗速、計每小時可行二百三十基羅米逹、飛機標誌爲（Ｆａｋｆｍ）由香港抵滬、僅須六小時可逹、</p>
<h3>久候未到</h3>
<p>昨日、本埠法領署所得消息、謂希女士已於昨晨七時十五分、由香港偕原助手勃萊克斯（Ｂｒａｘ）氏乘機出發來滬、計其行程、共七百英里、約下午一時許可抵此、因此各關係方面代表、如保安處長楊虎、特派股長王成志、率機器脚踏車機關槍保安隊一小排、至飛機塲爲之保護、此外歡迎者有航恊會秘書長林我將、法總領事梅理靄、領事古阿發、法捕房警務總幹法伯爾、法恊會代表伍丁耐、美國航空隊長阜祿大佐、以及法捕房政治部主任山多揚、曁中法各界士女等多人、均前往虹橋飛機塲歡迎、同時公安局護照檢查處、亦特派姚昌震·張非凡二人、前往飛機塲准備檢騐入境護照、及有無違禁品等、但各方歡迎人、直候至下午四時四十分、仍未見該飛機到滬、以電話向法領署及有關係各方詢問、亦未接有關於希女士之任何報告、於是各歡迎人不耐、相繼返寓休息、</p>
<h3>天氣不佳</h3>
<p>昨日據虹橋飛機塲所接報告知由杭州至香港間、華南各埠之氣候、頗爲惡劣、以此情形測之、希女士昨晨自香港出發後、未見到滬、當係因天氣不佳而被阻無疑、但中途降落於何地、迄無消息、</p>
<h3>音信查然</h3>
<p>昨晚中外各界紛電法領署探訪消息、法領署方面、亦分電福州·厦門·等處詢問、迄無飛機踪跡、音信杳然、聞女士所乘之飛機、並無無綫電之裝置、故各方對女士之安全問題、異常關心、</p>

<h3>試騐經過</h3>
<p>昨日由局長蔡旡忌氏發表意見、大意略云、本局今日召集中外茶商、討論實行改用無毒黃色色料之意義、及進行辦法、（一）本局自去年奉實業部令、從事於禁止有毒色料茶葉之出口、此事對於我國緑茶之對外貿易、關係極爲重要、蓋此種有毒色料之亟待禁止、爲本局檢騐政策上重要使命之一、固不待其他各國有所表示後、始始着手實行也、（二）惟關於本局去年所奉之辦法中、以時期及代替品之關係、一時頗難實行、嗣經中外茶商要求、由本局呈請實業部轉予通融一年、於本年新茶上市後、再行執行、業經實部核准、並於去年函令各中外茶商知照在案、（三）本局爲執行部令及解决茶商之困難起見、特於去年費長時期之歲月、由化騐處指定周技正、從事於無毒黃顔料之試製、幸在極短時期、業已完成、關於有毒及無毒黃色色料之利弊、及其創製之經過、周技正業已另擬報告書一份、可請到會諸君參考、（四）新發明之色料之成本、均較舊有之毒色料强大三分之一、二者並計、卽較强三分之二、而預計成本、無毒茶色色料自一至五號、每磅約高一倍、而六至八號、相差無幾、倘有大量之製造、以共同管理、則其價格較廉也（五）今日討論之重要問題有二、（甲）如何製造及販賣本局發明之無毒顔料、（乙）如何執行及監督各地茶商一致改用新顔料、並通知上海茶商恊會及洋莊茶業公會、去年並由本局派員赴徽屬各縣及紹興溫州各地宣傳、惟深恐少數茶商、陽奉陰違、故須請茶商共同實行、至本局發賣之無毒色料如有盈餘、則以充茶業上公共研究及公共事業之用、</p>
<h3>取締辦法</h3>
<p>該局並通告各中外茶莊行棧、使用無毒色料及檢騐辦法五項、（一）登記製茶工廠、爲本局便於指導監督起見、先令上海土莊茶號登記、其登記時期、約在本年二三月以前、（二）規定色料、查法國一九三二年七月七日頒佈、着色茶運入法屬地方規程、第一二條「各種茶混合而成者、及用靛青·薑黃·滑石·或石膏·等色料著色之緑茶、不在禁銷之例」、靛青因爲一般商人所習用、故青色已無甚問題、薑黃之用、以稍帶澀味、實際不無窒碍、本局從事研究、淡黃深黃等之代用品、已完成、而深黃如三魚等之代用品、業已試製完成、不久卽可分發各行棧、先爲試用、當亦有其結果、故關於着色色料、其有現成品物可用者、則擬加以指定、未有相當品物可用者、則擬由本局代爲製定、將色料頒佈、、（三）通令呈送茶樣、通令茶棧及土莊茶號、每種茶葉運到或製成之後、分佈茶樣於各洋行時、對本局亦須呈送一份、以便先行檢查、一經發現有違禁之着色、卽由本局通知茶棧及洋行、禁止賣買、爲事前之處理、以免引起意外之風波、此項辦法、於本年新茶上市時實行、（四）登記本年着色茶容量、明年新茶上市之前未售完之陳茶、茶商慣例、拚在新茶中出賣、勢必漁目混珠、對於取締上極感困難、擬在本年内定期令中外茶商將已存緑茶、卽行到局登記、同時並派人切實查明、免有隠瞞、凡經登記之緑茶出淨時、發現有毒色料者、卽照章嚴格取締、（五）請部通令産茶各省、製造緑茶茶商、注意色料、現在本局色料已决定、業已呈請通令各緑茶製造商注意、</p>
<h3>領導參觀</h3>
<p>該局爲使中外各茶商明瞭新創製無毒黃色色料起見、特將有毒色料茶葉及無毒色料茶葉分别用水冲於茶盅内、察看顔色深淡及茶質口味、結果、各茶商均認爲滿意、參觀畢、至五時散會、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<p>研究國際問題應該</p>
<p>先從什麽地方着手？　（三）</p>
<p>研究國際問題，第一，我們應站在史的唯物論的觀點，應特别注意經濟的背景。一切國際現象都是世界經濟變動的反映，離開資本主義經濟的體系及變動力去研究今日的國際問題·只是癡人說夢。要了解最近的國際事件，我們就得了解資本主義第三時期的經濟恐慌的特質，資本主義已由相互的妥恊而謀逹到　時和緩經濟的恐慌，和政治的危機的企圖，在一九三三年已遭受最後的慘敗了，進而來到的一九三四年自然是更露骨的進入備戰的階段，在這基礎上，必然會有，巴黎的血案，奥東的巷戰美國收買白銀，軍備　賽，秘約，同盟的歸結，同時，一致的向中國進攻，並聯合佈置反蘇戰爭。這一切構成目前國際的局勢，而其基礎不外於資本主義經濟的瓦解，世界經濟的動向已另轉入一新的方向。這就是國際紛爭的一切根本，分析國際問題　　的綫索。</p>
<p>第一，我們應從流動的過得中，矛盾的統一中去研究，各個國際事件的發生，都是過程中某一階段的産物，同時是矛盾的，彼此對立而又統一在一定的範疇中。一切國際現象都有一定的因果關係，者是連續的動，我們只能在動態中，才能得國際問題的眞象。譬如就國際聯盟說罷，國際聯盟本是英法意日旁國主義者宰割弱小民族殖民地及鎭壓世界革命的機關，一直發展到現在，它的本質上雖然没有變化，但目前這機關却有着防止德國法西斯蒂挑戰的作用，在某　意義上，它暫時反有存在的價值。如果看不清這點，也在此時高唱打倒國際聯盟，這無異援助了德國國社黨，加速帝國主義戰爭的暴發。又如現在奥國社會黨失敗了，就看作奥國資産者政治的穏定，那是完全錯誤的。社會黨的失敗，由然有它的客觀原因；主要的是它的政綱不能取得大衆的擁護，雖然這次流血有廣大民衆參加，可是因爲領導不能統一，致使大衆陣營的力量分散，與政府克制的力的對比上不相匹敵。但是，革命就鎭壓了麽？那又不然，這次社會黨的失敗，或者反有糾集大衆統一至　堅固正確領導，從此走上更頑强的肉搏的可能。並且奥國事件的發生，正是由於貧富兩羣團間對立的尖銳化上的産物，是資本主義没落過程必有的現象，不能卽謂少數專政的勝利。所以我們只能就其發展過程去探討，才能認識奥國事件的眞相。</p>
<p>第三，我們應注意從聯繋中去研究。這就是說，現在世界上没有那一件國際事件是究全不與人家相干的。中國的「匪」思，看來好像是中國問題，不干他人的事，其實不然，英國　會就非常關心，美法日各國更不敢輕視。這是因爲中國是他們大家的市塲，市塲不靜，會影響到他們的買賣，生産，勞資鬥爭，失業，社會的紊亂，甚至資本主義崩潰瓦解等等。</p>
<p>以十不過略爲提示了幾個原則。要想正確研究國際問題，自然對於社會科學應有相當的素養。尤其對於經濟學及史的唯物論應有正確的知識。以外，就是能將這些原理應用到實際上去。這是比較困難的一個問題，如果你用的方法不精，自然你不能有正確的估計，如果方法上有了毛病，那就更是南轅北轍了。（關於這一個問題，本部自學叢書中有怎樣自學國際問題一書，下月可以出版，可供參改，此地恕不多贅）。</p>
<p>（三）一個不懂外國文字的人，也可以研究國際問題，不過，對於研究資料的搜集範圍方面要仄狹些罷了。至若不懂經濟羣則比較困難。因爲一個研究者最低限度也應該懂得資本主義經濟的構造與動向，否則實不易入手。至於如何滿足你的慾望，自然只有你化一點時間去讀幾本最初淺而可靠的經濟學原論的書，或者，向懂得經濟學的朋友前去作一點經濟學上初步知識的討論　！</p>
<p>四，研究經濟學要從何處着手，說來話長，祇好留在有機會時再談，好在本部不久有關於這類書籍研究法的出版，可供發放。在出版前，我覺得你還可參放本報二月二十一，二十二，二十三日讀書問答欄所發表之社會科學的初步讀法一文。</p>
<p>以外，關於搜集研究資料要特别注意。資料的來源，自然不出「看報」，「看雜誌」，但報紙雜誌大多是有背景的，你得有辨别某家通訊社是那一帝國主義的御用機關，某一雜誌，是以那一派政治的立塲爲其背景。你不知道材料來源，宣傳機關的作用，你雖有正確的研究方法，仍然一無用處。</p>
<p>承你不恥下問，我們非常歡迎，等你讀了此文後，還有不明瞭或不滿意的地方，我們望你再來信討論，至於我們意見也請你及一切讀者不客氣的批評。</p>

<h3>技藝佳妙沈林策領導</h3>
<p>沈氏開塲頗佳、第三槍三十一點、第七槍三七點、兩次流利而又清爽之巨數發現後、沈氏巳超出五十餘點、至第十槍聶珂耳忽而一手得五一點、雙方形勢均衡、上下在十數左右、顧在各種擊法推測將來、沈氏多材多藝、較有把握、果然槍無處發、每出必獲、轉輾至第四十槍時、沈氏迪以二一·三九·六八·二一·二一·二五·二二之巨數、相加而成四五七比三五三之領導多獲、二○四點、此爲沈氏之黄金時代、</p>
<h3>長勁十足聶珂耳反勝</h3>
<p>目的七百五十點、巨數也、非一時可以達到、技藝經騐之外、尚有待長勁爲之後盾也、沈氏斯時漸露疲狀入後尤覺不支、聶珂耳則不然、長勁十足、四七·二○·六五·五○·二三·三八·三○繼續産生、先達目的、沈氏亦連得三八·二五·二六·二四·二四·等數、屆精力不濟、功虧一簣、卒以七三二比七五○受挫、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>春雪</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>我記得俗諺道：「做天難做四月天，　要溫和麥要寒。」因爲四月裏的天氣，正是麥穗長成的當兒，是要以冷爲宜，而同時又是養蠶的時節，蠶兒却非溫暖不可。適宜了麥，便損傷了蠶；愛護了蠶，便吃虧了麥；二者不可得兼，所以這四月裏的天公，也實在不容易做哩！</p>
<p>現在初春，還没有到四月，似乎做天不難，孰知却亦非易。因爲在這二月的天氣，忽然大釀春寒，有的地方，竟下了大雪。春寒本是常事，所謂「春寒凍死老黃牛，」舊傳「二月初八，張大帝生日，吃凍狗肉。」不都是表明春寒的利害嗎？可是不下雪還好，一下雪又闖下禍來了。</p>
<p>原來雪這樣東西，須下得合時，下得適當。在臘月裏下梜名爲「臘雪，」有益無害，愈大愈好，田裏害蟲，都可凍死，明年田事順利，且爲豐年之兆。便是「瑞雪」。一交春苓，倘然下雪，名爲「春雪」，春雪有傷春熟，於農田有損無益，所以這一回的天，下了春雪又受到農民不少的怨言。</p>
<p>說是去年風調雨順，五穀豐登，尙且農村破産，農民呌苦，天公不加救濟，反下傷農之雪，倘然今年加以災殃，田事荒歉，那更不堪設想。所以春雪之下，實是天的不識相，天的不知趣，凡是不識相和不知趣，無論是人是天，便是挨駡。也是應該。</p>
<p>不要說雪，要下得其宣，便是說雨，也是如此，下得其時，便是「時雨」，久旱逢雨，更稱「甘霖」。反轉來說，下不得時，非是「霪雨」，便是「暴雨」。我願天公，自知悔悟，將功靡罪，時降「甘雨」，以補「春雪」之愆。暴雨勿至，霪雨勿見，裨益農事，嘉惠蒼生，吾知怨天者必將頌天，恨天者必將德天了。</p>
<p>做天旣難，做人更難，所作所爲，要人勿怨；一言一動，要人稱頌；德之所至，恨從何來？也在求其適合時宜，嘉惠洯衆而已。</p>
<h3>老敎授</h3>
<p>— 壽丞</p>
<p>老敎授把將堕至鼻尖的厚玻璃眼鏡抬了抬，啞着喉嚨嚷·頸際的青筋·一根根緊突着·脣邊的灰黃色稀鬚，随着嘴的張翕而聳動着·</p>
<p>全敎室青年緊張的情緒，全凝注在他那揮舞動搖的手指｜｜這裏充塞了他畢生的心血，熱情，和厚望·他盡力講解，一遍，兩遍，不憚厭煩的重復·不顧自己的聲嘶，不管自己的力竭，他唯一的願望，祇求没有個學生肯含糊過去</p>
<p>偶然，瞥見有學生在竊竊私語，或者向窗外閒眺·那他可怒透啦，殺坯，種生，頓足大駡·可是隔不多時，他就走近剛纔被責的同學身畔，用枯瘠的手撫摩他的柔髪，關藹地，懇切地，告誡他：孩子，不要恨，我吧，爲了你的將來，我纔埋怨你啊！</p>
<p>每次，當他講授完畢一個段落的時候，他總得凑近同學的面前，含着懇摯的熱望，問着懂嗎？懂嗎？直等到大家都點頭表示明澈了解了他所講的一切，於是他滿足的微笑了·但最後他還要聲明：不要欺騙我啊！這是很容易懂得的，祇要你們肯用心·</p>
<p>有時，他偶爾很高興的誇耀自己的學識和經歷，但不一會，他就轉變道！我老了，不中用啦！你們正年青哩，努力啊！我希望你們將來個個都比我老朽强！</p>
<p>不論是嚴寒或酷暑，甚至，沾染了疾病，他總挾着皮包，到學校上課·某次，有位同學對他道：先生，你的身子不大清健，應該安息些時呀！他却答道：我是負有造成青年的鉅大責任，怎敢任意缺席！如果我荒癈了你們的學業，呌我如何對得起你們父兄的期望啊！</p>
<p>他衣袖老是粘滿了白粉筆屑，那挾在腋下晦黯破舊的書面，早没有當年鮮艶的色彩；可是我們老敎授的精神啊，永遠像太陽般的健在！</p>
<h3>隨筆</h3>
<p>— 趙廷芳</p>
<p>Ｓ先生講國語文，講到郭沫若一首新詩｜｜｜雨後的宇宙，似淚洗過的良心，他突然發怒道：「這呌什麽話？太胡鬧極了！淚在眼裏，心在肚裏，相隔一層肚皮，如何連在一塊兒？眞正豈有此理！咳！淚都能够洗心呵！</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>童時私塾先生敎對聯語，我素性頑皮他便常常將難題給我做，做不好，定打乎心，一天他出個五字聯：「人愛肥鷄母，」我想了半天，雖可勉强回答，却不敢對了上去，害得我哭笑不成，臨到放晚學，他呌我過去駡道：「頑皮東西！」這點事就難對了嗎？你可對着「我跟胖婆娘」呀！我不禁撲赤的一聲笑了，把鼻涕噴了老師的書案，老師也微微地笑道：「去罷！」</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>新小說家多標榜着象徵派，浪漫派，寫實派等等，以自炫有所宗承。現在最風行的，首推寫實一派，但我總覺尙有幾分矯揉造作。遠不如前三年在家鄕東山脚下上墳，經過一家茅屋農舍底門上的一副新年對聯：「春花春酒春富貴，臘鷄臘膀臘香腸，」比較寫實來得有趣！</p>

<h3>戀愛隨筆</h3>
<p>— 母澤卿</p>
<p>戀愛像一張無定期的支票，能否兌現，就看人技術如何？</p>
<p>熱戀在産生甜蜜以後，彷徨和恐怖便來了！</p>
<p>聰明人的初戀是秘密的，他怕人笑他拿空頭支票。平凡人的戀愛是公開的，他深恐别人不知道他的幸運。</p>
<p>舊式女子的愛，好像寗靜的湖水，没有潮汛，新式女子的愛，好似標金的價格，時常有漲落。</p>
<p>初戀時總想把對主佔有。佔有後又想放鬆了。</p>
<p>家書抵萬金，情書比萬金更值重價。</p>
<p>女子不喜歡愛文學家，伊怕在失戀後把伊當作題材。</p>
<p>一個女子同男子逹到了熱愛，距愛的焦點快進的時候，伊不承認在同男子「愛」伊只承認是「好」。</p>
<p>在戀愛中的人有五病：相思病，憂鬰病，神經病，腎病，失眠症。</p>
<p>結婚是戀愛走向墳墓，遠離也是一樣，天將愁味釀多情，起盋是個對折。</p>
<p>精神戀愛與肉體戀愛之间，只隔一層神秘的薄紙，弄破後一文不值。</p>
<p>有人以爲「一見生情」的戀愛是感情衝動，只是雙方一時的玩意兒。然而循着愛之程序而完成的戀愛，而塞礎也有一半是建在沙土上。</p>
<p>爲了試探的緣故，女子總是尋機會折磨男子。有時男子是覺得愈痛苦而愈快樂，有時又覺得不得忍受。假如男子能度過或勝過女子的試探與折磨，女子却更能死心地熱愛。</p>
<p>男女偎抱時，只恨時间過去太快。</p>
<p>痴情人爲舊式女子所讚美，但新式女子只覺得可憐可笑。</p>
<p>有纞愛經騐的男子怕有經騐的女子，兩個都是老手，反而没有眞情和趣味可言。女子有同樣的心理。</p>
<p>初見面時的「愛之喜樂」具有錯綜的思想，在敬和愛之思想後，剩下的只有「可憐」了！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十五回</p>
<p>淚臉送人辭家歸遠氏</p>
<p>風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>自强看了一看表，又過了址分鐘了，便向趙翁道：你没有什麽話了嗎？趙翁道：有話我昨天都說了，没什麽可說的了，凡事你自己保重。江氏在一邊揷嘴道：對了，凡事你都要保重。自强不曾說什麽話，又掏出表來看看。趙翁道：呌小林來和你拿着行李，你先到汽車站上去等着罷。我們都送你到車站上去。自强笑道：兩位老人家都送我，我怎樣敢當，讓桂枝送我也就行了。趙翁心裏總是體恤着兒子的，旣然他說讓嬌妻單獨的去送，也許這裏面另外有什麽緣故，於是向江氏望着道：我們不送也好。江氏根本就不曾說要送，趙翁如此說着，自然也就不認可的而認可了。自强在堂屋中間，呆站了一會，回頭向院子裏看了兩眼，依然還是站住。桂枝看他想走而又不想走的樣子，便道：到汽車站上還有幾步路呢，我們先走罷。自强於是向趙翁呌了一聲爸，又向江氏呌了一聲老太太，然後說一聲我走了，手取下了帽子，深深的鞠了兩個躬，戴上帽子，突然作個立正式，向後轉着，立刻開了大步子，走了出去。當他走的時候，頭也不扭轉來看上一看。只聽到那皮鞋聲　的　的響着，一路響出了大門去。小林提着提箱提包，在後跟着，桂枝却是很快的搶了向前，緊緊的隨在他身後。自强走起來自很快的，到了大門外，他的步子可就停了，向桂枝道：兩位老人家，說了什麽嗎？桂枝還不曾答復他的話，後面却有人呌道：自强，你到了營裏，馬上就跟我寫信來呀。（三二四）</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>記馬里剌嘉年華會</h3>
<p>— 顔文初</p>
<p>二十餘年來，一年一度之嘉年華會，世人似已厭之。而菲政府方面，乃屢極力提倡舉行，一則在此商業衰落中，馬里剌爲菲律濱首者，得此點綴，四方觀客雲集，市面轉有生氣，正如進一帖興奮劑，可以提醒精神。一則市民終歲勤勞，暑季苦熱，雨季苦濕，春初有此勝會，爲精神上調劑，在婦孺更覺生氣勃勃。而本届之嘉年華會，在我華僑方面，尤有一記價值。</p>
<p>其最足點綴此勝會風光者，爲菲律濱女士（卽花后）之選舉。此二十年中恢復數年前舊制，初選之權，在各日報與曾經註册之雜誌，複選之權在股東。（每股十元，由會中給予優美徽章，免購入門劵，有五夜入大禮堂，觀各種表演並與跳舞權利）十餘年前，菲督夏里遜女公子，有意爲此皇冕繼承人，結果逐鹿者多，主持人折衷辦法，破例分爲東西二后，兩宫並治，可見此十六夜之寳座光榮，非尋常閨秀可容易得來。不謂今年菲律濱女士，中國女子，竟得最多票數。開華會的未曾有紀錄，亦僑界破天荒之韻事。查女士係僑商陳而鏗女公子，肄業國民大學音樂科，陳君與菲政界多交遊，朋輩爲多方運動，始得良好結果。</p>
<p>全會開幕十六夜，有四次大遊行，第一次爲普通遊行，凡機關社團商店等皆可加入，或羣衆結隊，或裝飾花車，中華商會所裝飾花車爲三十年前之中國，與三十年來中國兩現象，評判發表，竟以寓意深遠得首奬。第二次爲敎育遊行，各僑校童子軍亦予加入，殿以華倁敎育會裝飾之花車，其命意爲世界公理被飛機大砲所壓迫，和平之神與地球距離尙遠，評判結果，以裝飾華麗勝，得第二奬。此可謂搔不着癢處也。</p>
<p>在大禮堂中每夜表演，皆變更節目，本月四號下午四點，爲兒童日，函請各國僑校加入。其表演先後，由抽籤决定，首爲日校女學生，共二百餘人，短衣藍裙，分站外中内三圓週，作國旗舞，其步伐與音樂，甚爲拍合。次爲菲男女童百餘人，作青年男女追求，爲種種新式跳舞。三爲西班牙童男女表演古代三王子爲鬥牛之戲，觀其得勝後，觀男女歡忻歌舞作樂。四爲我橋女校表演木蘭從軍，時間關係，（祇限二十分鐘）故祇演古宫裝之木蘭將軍，身率兵士，躬赴前敵，劍影刀光，舞弄生姿。五爲美童演村居鄕民，受紅夷包圍，全家覆亡，幼女被紅敵掠去，改換服裝，亦不表示結局。總觀各國表演，雖屬雛形，各肖國性。日本帶有軍國臭味；菲人不脫追求本色；西班牙尙多宗敎色彩；我國則古色古香。美人選舉，評判員七人，四爲女界領袖，三爲西中日領事夫人，閉幕後宣佈，中國得首奬，日本得第二奬，其評語爲裝束象徵優美，發揚東方女權云。</p>

<h3>國貨界當前的兩大危機</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>誰也知道，在國是個生産落後的國家，所以，對於生産額和消費額，是只有二與五之比，而「産不敷求」的現象，也就自然的造成年來我然的趨勢，看農村破産了，手工業是總歸於天演淘汰了，現在，我們所急需的，自然只有希望着國物生産事業之勃興，冀以稍補自己之不足，而挽過去之頽勢，可是痛心的事實，却又把我們熱烈的希望所粉碎，所謂新興工業，實在是仍在更得漏殘，四顧茫茫的黑夜裏，黑漆一團，荆棘叢生的前途，他的進展與呆滯，自然可想而知，並且，細審他的内在之矛盾與衝突性，種種現象之惡劣，實在是只有在開倒車，單以眼前的情勢而論，國貨界當前，就有兩大危機的存在，假使不速躱免而有繼續性的話，那麽都可制國貨廠商於死命。</p>
<p>（一）同業類軋的嚴重性　這個問題，人家往往稱是國人的特性，但我說，毋寗說他是國人的死症的因爲，這種劣根性的表露，我可截金撃鐵的判定他是國貨進展前途最大的魔障，往往一個企業，他的出品和名譽，很受社會的需要和歡迎，可是偶爾因爲一二新廠的貶價，遂足引起整個企業自相踐踏之導火綫，什麽跌價競爭，製造次貨，「副號」「特價」之聲，擾攘市面，甚者違背公會定章，推翻以前議案，狂悖行動，不一而足，而最後總不免因成本關係，而出於偸工减料一途，因此，社會失去信仰，日漸淘汰，而至於不救。</p>
<p>（二）外貨傾銷的深刻化　帝國主義者眼見世界經濟恐慌的日益深刻化，危機無法克服，市塲日趨狹窄，生産過剩，失業日衆，於是盡量地企圖將危機損失，盡可能範圍内想轉嫁到中國，而傾銷政策，變本加厲，尤其是日本，這殺人不眨眼的惡魔，近更政商聯合，以有組織，有計劃的策略，實肄業大規模的傾銷，别的不說，單據前日報載日米二百萬石運華，自然已够號稱「以農立國」的我們所恐怕了。</p>
<h3>照妖鏡</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>近以市上流行之無頭燈泡，與無綫電收音機，價格低廉，出乎意外，其實大都爲日貨。販賣者圖良心汨滅，唯利是圖，購用者果具血氣，自應嚴格審愼，切勿爲「貪便宜」之一念，以禍國害民。</p>
<p>有服務關上之客來言，謂日前關中查到在匯山碼頭上岸之數十箱鉛筆，必以爲日貨無疑，詎揭開之後，爲大華鉛筆，與原有者之牌子，竟難判别，此中肄問，迄今未明，求我爲之探查，惜大華廠處在香港，不知究竟如何，可見選購用品之不易也。</p>
<p>老友某君，至某所購一派克自來水筆，用後卽覺不良，適遇某友，因言此爲日本仿製之副牌筆，其價不及派克自來水筆六分之一，而形式字樣，不易判辨。某君馳詢商務參贊安諾，安亦力言其贋，某君以出高價，而得贋品，極爲憤慨，正告販賣商與購貨者，今後應千萬注意。如果識虽不清，還是信任國貨公司，較爲可靠。</p>
<p>風雨飄搖，危機四伏，我國貨前途，實未許樂觀，而值此千鈞一髮，禍迫眉睫之際，我主國貨者，其將將如何斟酌局面，殫精絕慮，以冀打開此嚴重之局勢，而挽已倒之狂瀾。</p>
<h3>女傭的愛國心</h3>
<p>— 趙孝揚</p>
<p>張媽整整地辛勞了一個月，領得了四塊錢的工錢，欣冲冲的到某路上去剪些寒冬的衣料。</p>
<p>等到買了回來，她很得意地拿給媽看！</p>
<p>「太太我買到便宜了！這件衣料祇合着六分錢一尺，花樣倒也不差！」</p>
<p>凑巧給倩姊看見了！頓然發現了這衣料上的痕跡！</p>
<p>「張媽！你買了東洋貨了！所以價錢這樣便腚，你瞧！這衣料的邊縫上，不是黏着一張很清晰的（Ｍａｄｅ　ｉｎ　Ｊａｐａｎ）的標幟麽？」</p>
<p>倩姊的目力，畢竟是高明得多啦！　　「什麽？我明明是在ＸＸ商店裏買的呵！」張媽總有些兒懹疑，她仔細把衣料看了一遍，覺得織製十分簡陋，</p>
<p>「可不是上了當啦！告訴你吧！這類店舖子，專斡這種投機事業的，表面上，大吹大擂地說是提倡國貨，實際上却不斷的把仇貨輸了進來！說起來眞使人心痛呢！」</p>
<p>倩姊滔滔地解釋給她聽</p>
<p>「呵！小姐，這件衣料我不要做了！可是棄掉倒有些不合算，還是給小寳當作尿布吧！唉！這班不顧廉恥的奸商，遲早終有失敗的一天呢！」</p>
<p>張媽滿腔的愛國心，引起了傅姊無限的感激，接着倩姊同她到附近的國貨商塲裏去剪了些國産的自由呢衣料，價錢雖比較貴一些，可是質料却是結實極了！</p>
<p>我想，一個目不識丁的女傭，居然有這樣一片眞誠的愛國心，眞使我感到十二分地敬仰和欽佩，不知幾位摩登小姐聽見了！要作何感想呢？</p>
<h3>誰是谁非？</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>誰都知道：事實是最雄辯！他和她的夫人愛國女生結婚之第，總覺得二性生活琴瑟不調！他是一位摩登式的西裝青年，她是一位不喜修飾，酷愛儉德的一位愛國女子。</p>
<p>他誤認爲都市裏的姑娘，是不變公式的好虛榮！好奢華！當他倆初婚的時候，他爲討好夫人起見，公畢回來！總買些舶來品脂粉進貢，他一壁向夫人微笑道：</p>
<p>Ｍｙ　Ｌｏｖｅ。你這個喜歡嗎？她不踩，也不理，她芳衷一縷……的在想，「中國的青年男子，爲什麽要這樣的無恥｜去媚外呢？不，也許他玩弄女性的媚内性成叱！唉！」</p>
<p>片晌：她纔莊重的同丈夫說：</p>
<p>「中國人請說中國話！中國人請用中國貨，這堕落的東西！還是請你　　給你心理所愛的摩登姑娘吧！」</p>
<p>他聽到這裏，不覺火從心頭起「想這女子太不識抬舉了，新婚伊爾，非但得不到甜蜜的快樂，竟受着一股無處發洩的氣憤！志不同，道不合，他媽的！决定和她離婚，看她怎麽樣？」他悻悻然的溜之大吉｜她也感覺無趣｜傷心她的遇人不淑｜也就回了娘家，隔了不多幾天，雙方果然涉訟了|是他的主動，要求法官准許離異，法官傳詢她糾紛的事實，她侃侃而談的陳述一過，末了｜還說誰是誰非？自有公論！恰巧這位法官，是服用國貨的信徒，並且，奉到司法部的功令，要厲行服用國貨，有違者處罰的明文！法官聽她陳訴之後，也不禁火從心頭起，拍案駡他，無恥！駡他是帝國主義者的走狗奸商的走狗！判他一個「媚外棄妻」罪！要繋之囹圄，他才懺悔的想：想不到女子有這般的魔力！我不該魯莽啊……」他的夫人，看他有悔悟的樣子，就向法官力保，寛其旣往！法官答應了！他惶悚而很恭敬的跟着她歸去！</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年婦女應做到的幾件事</h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>今年是婦女國貨年。婦女對於提倡國貨，所負的責任該是多麽重大？現在我撇開一切空話不談，只談一般婦女在本年度應該做到的幾件事。</p>
<p>（一）不論衣食住的所需，立志不用洋貨，只用國貨，少用一分錢的洋貨，卽爲國家挽回一分利權，切忌口是心非，嘴上說着提倡國貨，而實際上却是洋貨的大主顧。</p>
<p>（二）規勸丈夫不用洋貨，假使自己的丈夫是歡喜用洋貨的，你應該正色的勸告他，不要再用洋貨。</p>
<p>（三）假如你已經有了孩子，那末他的生活所需，如衣服，玩具等，决不可購用洋貨，應一律購用國貨。</p>
<p>（四）勸告親友服用國貨。</p>
<p>以上所說，也許是老生常談，但如果大家都能如此做，其收効之宏，一定是很大的。</p>

<h3>提高銀價與可驚之入超數</h3>
<p>— 仰莾</p>
<p>最近江海關稅務司發表本年本市一月份國際貿易狀况，入超竟逹四千餘萬元之多，爲數年來空前之突增，觀測未來，尙有繼續奔腾之勢。</p>
<p>可驚哉此入超額，眞足以制中國人之生命，而淪於萬刧不復之地。吾嘗推究原因，其主要問題，在乎世界各國銀價之提高，蓋銀價一高，不啻使用金國家之金幣降低，而其國内貨物之市價，尤覺傾銷國外之合算，中國旣爲用銀之國，恰爲各國銷貨最適且之市塲，而外貨之來如潮如湧，不可遏止，經此提高以後，在國外之貨物，固然輸入合算，侵奪國貨之銷路，而國貨價格，不啻無形減低，益有不易支持之勢。此更關於國貨前途之生死問題。一月份可驚之入超，雖原因不止一端，而食銀價提高之賜，無可諱飾。加以國人眼光短淺，利己心重，甘冒不韙，購入日貨而冒充國貨者，旣不乏人，專圖私利，不顧大局以販賣日貨爲得計者，更大有人在。人之無良，人之無恥，一至於此，尤爲痛心不置，我人含生負氣，一息尙存，自當秉茲良心，以燭奸慝，並願愛國人士值此婦女國貨年中，共起奮鬭，以挽利權。而於銀價問題，亦當切實研究，共謀救濟也。</p>

<h3>婦女國貨年與家庭手工業</h3>
<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>過去了一個國貨年，跟來了一個婦女國貨年，總之國貨還需要提倡，更需要製造；然而試觀已成立之國貨工廠，其數有幾？其成績已属難得！而其能力尙嫌到不足！這也是事寔的問題，本來一個工廠的要辦得完美，除掉鉅太之資本而外，舉凡工作管理，材料支配，勞工糾紛，等全属應得注意，而辦理因難的問題，尤其是在現今中國缺少資本和人才的當兒，更覺得辦理大工廠之棘手，那麽，怎樣？棘手就不辦了嗎？不，吾們在這種從農業過渡到工業之時代，旣然不能完全舉辦大工廠，那末就大家來提倡家庭手工業，以資普週，而挽救燃眉之急，這樣除掉一部份重工業由國家經營而外，餘可以不用大規模的工業，儘可由家庭作單位而深入民間去，其給營的本錢幾百元也好，幾千元也好，其集合時家庭四五家也好，十家二十家也好，如是一來，吾想在天災頻仍的蹇運中生活着的農民，或許也可因餘暇之從事工業而得以稍蘇其困，亦未可知則在提倡國貨而外，更解决了一部份的農村經濟，是誠一舉而貳得者也。</p>
<p>在華北不是有國貨的着毛織品在製造嗎？那種大量的羊毛織品，可並不是從燒煤的工廠中製出，而是華北農民，耕餘的工作成績，此宗事業之首倡者，是基督敎青年會的人員，本來華北每年有無數量羊毛被棄捨了，這是極可惜的一筆浪費，可是旣没有工廠，不抛棄也没有出路，青年會有見於此，於是到紡織工業最進步之英國，把她們百年前農民用來織羊毛的簡單人工機械，給搬運中國來，稍中改良，令木匠倣造，設學校訓練敎導人材，一而十之，十而百之，分頭深入農民家庭，使鄕村婦女利用廢物間暇，織造物品。像此種十人家的舊傢伙，或許有人要說到落伍等等的高調，吾以爲這並不是可恥，而寔在爲目前中國大可寔施的一方法。現在華北的成績是如此，只要你明白之後，定然會發出「好！不差！這到一種辦法！」的批評與想吧！旣然，事寔是如此，那末全國各處，大可以繼續努力，而一致提倡家庭手工，是亦上策。</p>
<p>家庭手工業之重要，和必須提倡，旣如上述，而在本年之所謂婦女國貨者，提倡家庭手業，當更爲合時矣，爲的是婦女爲家心之重心，尤其在現代中國，婦女職業不景氣之時機，有的坐守家庭，不若另謀出路，憑各個之財力能力，分頭或合，主辦家庭手業，似乎更爲合算適宜，這並不是說家庭工業不需要男子，其寔娘兒們要掙扎得平等地位，這眞是極平坦的一條大道，而且婦女從事於家庭工業，對於家庭中主婦的責任，亦可隨時照顧，不必虞他，而可以放胆的幹，親愛的女同胞：大槪看到這頁報紙諸位，總是什麽學校畢業或肄業的智識階級，請接受記者的意，把你們每天化在妝飾，賭博，或其他娛樂所浪費掉的精神與金錢，轉移到從事家庭工業的一途，吾想定可以收獲得比現在更好的幸福，這的確是公私兩便，救國拯民的一大要圖，記着吧！努力吧！看在這婦女國貨年的期中，給婦女與國界放一異光！</p>

<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>電報與道路（下）</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>電報雖傳遞甚速，瞬息千里，然亦有時不無略感遲滯。此種遲滯之原因，不祇一項，若經收發報人，向局臺作一度之詢問，當可充分明瞭。今有駛車赴某地者，中間經行道路，或在修理，暫停車輛往來，在此種情形下，不得不繞道以逹。於是原定十五分鐘可至目的地者，因繞道關係，須增加五分鐘。此爲事實所難免，亦可與電報互爲此證。例如滬潯（九江）直逹，偶因災害損及綫路，一方因在急速修理，同時電報傳送，亦不能不使其稍有停留，此時如滬漢及漢潯綫路可通，則改拍漢口，再轉九江。凡此調度，不一其例。均可目爲繞道；所遲之時間，卽爲繞道之時間，以電路如血脈之互通，費時自屬甚暫也。</p>
<p>通常有所謂「綫路擁擠」，此名稱在報紙記載電報消息上，亦屬屢見。實際綫路之擁擠，卽電報之擁擠。電報何以發生擁擠？則可說大部分與時局攸關。時局緊張之際，官軍各電，紛至沓來，其性質卽極重要而機密，按章自應提前拍送，此如路上行車，忽遇風馳電掣之救火車，不得不讓道，任其先行通過。又官軍電報旣多，恍同交通要道，電車汽車以及人力車種種，集於一處，駕車者遇此，須守先後之秩序，不能任意加足速力矣。</p>
<p>尙有一層，厥爲電報之受檢查。平日電報不受檢查，經過業務上簡單之手續，分别拍送，爲時極速。若遇時局發生變化，軍事機關，卽有檢查電報之舉。電報一經檢查，則於拍送時間之外，又增加若干檢查時間。戒嚴時期，通行車輛，亦多到處停車，備受檢查，試問一查再查，車之經行，尙能照平時所定時間到逹否？通報與行車，殊可等量齊觀也。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見道路交通，與電報交通，極多相似之點；祇以道路往來，衆目共見，行車遲滯，或者發生事故，視爲當然，卽無足怪。至於發寄電報，局中傳遞情形，一經道破，初無二致，乃明於道路者，未必明乎電報，此則電信内容，未經宣佈，外界責難，斯未能免。本人此作，或者以爲對於服務電信界人員，多所廻護，其實此種現象，盡多事實足資證明，各界不乏明逹之士，苟經調查（調查極所歡迎，）當知電報本身，正確迅速，間或遇有遲滯，固有種種之原因在也。</p>
<h3>「打電報到北平去」</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>讀海上某報記載，知大東書局所發行的自然敎科書第七册中，有「打電報到北平去」一課，内容大意：「由上海打電報到北平，須經南京及天津電報局接轉，一兩天後可到」滬平電報，而由京接轉，爲時又須一兩天，在稍具電信智識者讀之，難免引起駭怪，作者的一枝筆，簡直是「驚人之筆」！</p>
<p>其實這位著作家，如果一定要做這課「打電報到北平去」而又怕出報費，不妨勞駕至電報局或無綫電台詢問處，作一度詢問。閉門造車，開門也能合轍。當然不致編撰失實，鑄成大錯。</p>
<p>不過話又要說回來了，敎科書的作家，在社會上總可說是智識階級分子，然而對於電信常識，尙未能充分明瞭，則一般非智識階級者，更可想而知，所以灌輸電報電話無綫電普通學識，使一般均能了解利用，實在是「當務之急」。</p>
<h3>過去一年中有綫電報綫路之施設（上）錢家廣</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>已修整之幹支綫計五千三百七十一公里</p>
<p>已增設之新綫路計二千一百零四公里。</p>
<p>就原桿加掛綫條計一千零九十三公里。</p>
<p>增設水綫一處。修通水綫六處。其餘正　　在修整改築中者。計二十二大段。</p>
<p>有綫電報之在我國，約有五十餘年之歷史，全國綫路的及十萬餘公里。雖與面積相比便，較諸各國，尙覺瞠乎其後：然自開創至今，中間所經，受政治之影響，與地方之變亂，及財力之蹶竭，施設方面，備遭打撃，斯實非短篇幅中所能盡道也。至就原有各綫，加以區分，重要者稱爲幹綫，次要者稱爲支綫）幹路以通信繁忙，故綫條之數，率較支路爲多。此亦係一種區别，幹綫支配，計有漢平，（漢口通北平）滬漢，（上海通漢口）滬福，（上海通福州）福廣，）福州通廣州）津浦，（天津通浦口）漢渝，（漢口通重慶）青滬，（青島通上海）烟濟，（烟台通濟南）平恰，（北平通恰克圖）北寗，（北平通遼寗）遼哈，（遼寗通哈爾濱）哈黑，（哈爾濱通黑河）平蘭，（北平通蘭州）九廣，（九江通廣州）廣邕，（廣州通南寗）武桂，（武昌通桂林）桂南，（桂林通南關）長畢，（長沙通畢節）西瀘，（西安通瀘州）渝滇，（重慶通雲南）雲辛，（雲南通小辛街）雲龍，（雲南通龍州）等處現已設立幹綫工務處，專事維護者計漢平，滬漢，滬福，福廣津浦，漢渝，青滬，烟濟，平恰，廣邕十處。此外分佈各省，成立各城市間之通信聯絡，槪稱爲支綫，歸各電報局負責維護。</p>
<p>綫路之造成，其主要吕卽爲木桿，綫條，木擔（在支綫上，因綫條數少，間亦不用木擔。）隔電子（普通或稱磁碗，每具速直脚或弦鈎。）四種。木桿之壽命，視木質之良窳，而有區别，平均約自六年至八年，苟維持得法，至多亦不逾十載，綫條雖較耐久，然經風雨剥蝕，架設年遠，外皮率起銹腐，對於通信電汉，增加阻力，故實際上縱未斷裂，而可用時間，亦不過十八年也。此外木擔隔電子壽命尤短，視沿綫情形，各有不同，實非一律。是知綫路一經造成，平時之管理巡護，應期周密，而壽命所限，欲謀通信之良好，更非審察實情加以修換不可。</p>
<p>我國維持幹支綫路辦法，從前每侈談「三年一小修，五年一大修。」所謂大修，卽將全綫澈底整理完善，但在軍閥秉政時代，於電政施設，往往祇顧目前，不圖將來，綫路雖已超過維持年限，亦未嘗未雨綢繆，祇作臨時補苴之計。譬如大厦，東傾四漏，荏苒因循，危象疊見。迨國民政府交通部成立之後，規定施政大綱，於綫路整理，特加注意。此所以歷年各幹支綫，除受匪亂影響，或災害（如大水颶風等）外，縱綫路建設過久，各處通信，均能暢逹無阻，至於積極整理，以圖刷新，亦繼續在努力進行迄未稍懈。過去去一年中探詢交通部關於綫路之施設，已覺蔚然可觀，今年更將多所建樹，綫路爲有綫電通信之重要工具，整理舊路與擴充新路，同時並進，通信前途，庶乎有豸。因舉所聞，誌之如次。</p>
<p>已修整之綫路</p>
<p>（一）計畫　遍佈全國之各路幹支綫，加以調查，除新設者外，未經大修者，多則十餘載，少亦七八年，若全部施行更換，事實上爲不經濟，財力上亦感不及。斟酌情形，於是預定十年輪流抽換辦法，卽將幹路各桿綫朽爛者，每歲抽換十分之一，如此十年之内，悉數換齊，周而復始，可以保持綫路壽命，適符年度。至於各處支綫，則酌量緩急，視察情形，除舊更新，亦期普遍，雖未能如幹綫一律辦法，然分省整理，固預定精密之步驟矣。</p>
<p>（二）統計　在過去一年中，交通部修整有綫電報綫路，總計爲五千三百七十一公里。茲就幹支綫兩項，加以區分，列舉如下。</p>
<p>（甲）幹綫｜｜總數爲三千七百三十二公里</p>

<h3>分道式自動話機之槪况（續）</h3>
<p>— 錦</p>
<p>愛德溫斯話局所裝用</p>
<p>（二）選擇器之優點</p>
<p>史端橋式自動機之選擇器，有兩種動作，卽上升與橫轉，此式僅用一種橫轉式選擇器，每個共有接綫瓣口一百零二個，排成半圓形，故其零件，可互用維持，自較兩種動作之選擇器方便省事。機件總重量較輕，佔地亦少，卽接綫所需時間，不論本地或長途，均較他式自動機爲速，且傳音亦較佳。</p>
<p>此器之本身，另附特種設備，爲他式所無，卽遇有話務特别繁忙時，可於數秒鐘内，以簡單之動作，將話務較簡處之選擇器，移置於話務特忙之處，以資調濟，故平日所用選擇器之數量，得以减少。</p>
<p>（三）話務紀錄設備之優點</p>
<p>本式自動機，備有自動紀錄話務之記數表，此表與用戸綫上所用者相似，以備考察選擇器使用情形而資配置。</p>
<p>（四）關於小交換機幹綫號碼之優點</p>
<p>（按此指小交換機用連那幹綫，接綫時須挨次試綫者而言。）縱使其末尾兩字爲零，亦無妨碍。各小交換機組，可隨意擴充，毋庸改號，且單號用戸，亦可參座其間。</p>
<p>（五）關於小分局間之接綫辦法</p>
<p>凡同一地方，有分局數處，而其他域並不甚大者，所有隣近局間用戸之交換，大率採用直接制，卽全由用戸操縱之。但對於相距較遠（非隣近局）之小分局，其通話綫路，經由中間一個或一個以上分局轉接者，爲節省中繼綫及便於分配路由起見，採用留號（Ｓｔｏｒａｇｅ）或變那（Ｔｒａｎｓ：ａｔｉｏｎ設備，蓋此種分局間用戸之通話次數不多，故祇備數留號或變號裝置卽可。又如遇通隣近分局之直逹綫路，均被佔用時，繼來之呌號，可另由中央局轉接。此種交換接續（Ａｌｔｅｒｎａｔｔｖｅ　Ｔｒｕｎｋｉｎｇ）可省去中繼約三分之一。以上兩項辦法，該局均可採用云。（完）</p>
<h3>關於福州的電報交通</h3>
<p>記者</p>
<p>閱二月六日天津大公報短評「福州的電報交通」，略謂福州訪員所發的有綫電報，總得經過七八天才能收到等語。據電報方面人員稱：「福州電報之所以稽延，並非因電綫遭受破壤，尙未修復，必須繞道轉遞之故。實因自陳銘樞李濟深等在閩倡亂後，中央抽調大軍入閩討伐，軍行所及，各地電局報務倍增，而江山建甌間電綫，又被軍事委員會交通處佔去兩綫，接通軍用電話。以致建甌浦城杭州各局，雖經加裝高速度收發報機，添派工作人員，積壓電報仍難疏通。至福州一處，則因南北各路電綫，均已阴斷，所有電報，除由無綫電接轉外，殊無繞道傳遞之可能。無綫電方面又因有綫電阻斷後，單獨負擔兩方報務，來往電報殊難清理，故不免積壓。至於閩事結束以後，沿途毁綫早於上月二十四日完全修通，惟因仍被軍隊佔用，不能立卽恢復滬福直逹工作。迨至本月六日，經與沿綫駐軍多次商酌，滬福直逹電綫方得接通，此後福州電報當能照常傳遞，可無積壓之虞矣」云云。記者按：自閩變發生，交通方面首當其衝者，厥爲電報。如軍隊割斷電綫也，佔借電綫也，檢查電報也，多發軍電也，在在無不予私人電報以致命傷！是以在軍事時期，私人電報，偶爾稽延，容或有之。但此種事實，實爲電信界人員極願避免者也。</p>
<h3>京滬長途電話與新聞界</h3>
<p>— 汪啓堃</p>
<p>本刋上期載有葉仲華先生之「電信界與新聞界之合作談」一文，叙述電信界對於新聞界之服務情形，而致其希望於二者間之合作。惟原文僅述電報方面情形，未及電話方面，爰贅數言，以廣其意。</p>
<p>近來新聞界之傳遞新聞，大都於電報外兼用長途電話。以南京與上海間而言，新聞之由長途電話傳遞者，或不在電報數量之下。電話局對於報館所發之長途電話，素極注意，力求其便利；且其所傳遞之消息，並不受檢查，故不致稽延，當爲新聞界所熟知。</p>
<p>惟是京滬間因電綫不多，報館使用長途電話之時間又大都相同，不免一時擁塞，不得已改發加急電話，以求提前輪及。又交通部近來對於報館所發長途電話，於接通後要求取消者，新規定須繳通話費三分之一，普通電話則否。以上二事或尙難使新聞界十分滿意。交通部有見於此，去年已决定沿京滬公路，另設京滬直逹長途電話綫四對，可用作六對，刻已開工，在三四個月内卽可告成，届時各報館可隨時通話，無需提前加急。至於長途電話於接通後要求取銷一事，現亦改爲報館與普通用戸受同等待遇，且另定期實行。况京滬間新話綫完成後，通話暢利，不致受掛號過多之影響，自可减除臨時要求取消之一舉。</p>
<p>依照京滬間長途電話歷年之營業統計，苟於現有電綫外另加一對，已可應付一切；今斯突增六對之多，需費五六十萬元，其目的可謂完全謀新聞界之便利。吾人於此，亦可覘電信界對於新聞界之服務精神也。</p>
<h3>國音電報</h3>
<p>— 徐隠蘆</p>
<p>我國文字複雜，部位繁多，實不如英文僅用二十六字母卽可組成各個不同字句那樣簡單，所以在電報拍發上，就必須要用法定的數碼來代表每一個字，卽普通所謂四碼。電報在未拍發之前，須先將電文譯成四碼，收報處再將四碼譯成中文，電報貴乎迅速，這樣輾轉翻譯，在時間上說已太不經濟，在手續上說又很麻煩，所以鐵路，輪船，及電信機關所發之公電，爲求敏捷便利起見，多半採用英文。但是號稱有數千年文化歷史的我國，自己拍發給自己的電報，反要採用英文，這不能不說是我們的一種恥辱和慚愧！</p>
<p>用英文旣不尊重國體，用四碼又有雙重翻譯的麻煩，於是改革我國電報的聲浪就一天一天的膨漲。可是改革電報的基本條件，就必須另創一種電報，使人一見卽解，不必轉譯，經過長時期的研究，國音電報就在這醞釀聲中而産生了！</p>
<p>所謂國音電報，就是以法定的符號來代表注音字母收發而成的電報，發報人祇須寫注音字母，收報人讀音就知文意，手續旣簡，時间又省，電員收發如遇有疑問時，可以立卽在機上詢問，錯誤减少。還有種國音縮字簡號代表固定的名稱或成語，以節省電報的數字，如「國民政府」祇須寫　　　　，「等因奉此」　　　　，如專用遇有名詞音同意異或深奥的字句，就先用傳聲來調凖，傳聲共有一個：陰陽平，上，去，入，如切音不凖，字就要讀别了，然後再用傳部來區别這字的部屬，傳部共一百○二個，份化各部，比較四碼容易記，如「電」字；國音是「　｜　　｜　」，「　｜　」就是電字的讀音。「　」是傳聲，表示它是去聲「　　」是傳部，代表它是雨字部，雖然一個字要用六個注音符號來代夫，可是用到傳聲部的字究是少數，所以我們祇須把傳聲傳部記熟，無論什麽字都可以解决了！在没有記熟與普通之前，還可以查前交通部拚音研究會編定的「國音電報彙編。」</p>
<p>發到國外去的電報，亦有一種國音羅馬字母電報，就是用羅馬字來代替國音，在組織上非常健全。此外國音電報還負有一種重大的使命，就是搆通語言統一！促成文化進步！</p>
<p>無論什麽事在創辦時，都要比較困難些，國音電報當然不能例外。可是我們要抛開個人的利害和情感，純理智的爲社會着想，立刻就可以意想到有積極推行與普遍的必要了！</p>
<p>國音電報，必須首先由我們電信界同仁來推行。這是當然的，但如果，社會上莫名其妙，其效果仍等於零，所以我們一方面固然要由電信界着手試騐，一方央尤須積極宣傳，普遍到社會上去應用。</p>
<p>現在我再來介紹國音電報在鐵路方面推行的經過：民國十一年前交通部在北平開第四次運輸會議，國音電報發明人四洮鐵路代表譚耀宗先生提議鐵路電報改用國音電報，决議由四洮鐵路先行試辦，十四年七月四洮鐵路完成改革的使命，經過三年的試騐時期，其中迭受阻碍，經過不少波折，但熱心和毅力，終得到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>自四洮鐵路改革成功之後，東北各路羣起仿傚，不久亦皆完全成功，現在東北各路一律用國音電報，都感覺比洋文與四碼便利得多。（九一八事變後東北各路有强迫用日文電報說，果眞則東北各路數年來慘淡經營之國音電報，將摧殘無餘。）</p>
<p>十九年三月鐵道部爲尊重國體起見；首先通令全國各鐵路，凡路用文字，一律須用中文，關於鐵路電報，亦依照東北各路的先例，决定改用國音電報，於是就聘請兩位東北國音電報專家，來部設立國音電報訓練班，由部内及京滬，津浦，膠濟，湘鄂，南潯等路，各派員若干出席研究，先後兩期畢業成績都很美滿，就派畢業學員先後回路推行，次第開班傳習，並先由京滬津浦與鐵道部來往電報實行改用國音，迄今三載，效用頗佳。繼之隴海道清及其他各路，亦已傳授完畢，現在津浦京滬各路爲謀國音電報早日完成起見，又組織國音電報推行委員會，積極進行，我們相信最近的將來，鐵路電報，完全國音化了。</p>
<p>科學的發明，隨社會需要而進步，一切新的代替了舊的，完善的淘汰了不健全的，我們不是認爲用英文電報之不合嗎？我們不是感覺用四碼電報之不便嗎？那麽我們就必須要去積極改革。改革就非國音電報不可！我們要早日完成改革的使命；必有我們電信界同仁羣起努力！</p>
<p>編者按：交通部對於推行國音電報一節，以舊交通部於民國址七年編　　印之國音電報彙編，與中央現行之注音符號新標凖，頗多不同之處，　　已派員修改，並將原稿携赴北平國語統一籌備委員會詳細核校。聞該　　編不日審定完畢，卽可着手進行云。</p>
<p>半月消息</p>
<p>— 社友</p>
<h3>郵電兩局行將實行合設</h3>
<p>交部爲便利民衆通訊及節省經費起見，最近特令郵政總局派員來京與該部電政司商定郵電合設辦法，並飭各有關之郵電局迅照該項辦法進行合設事宜。茲將該辦法重要各點探誌如下：</p>
<p>（一）三等及三等　以下電局應與郵局合設一處，先從江蘇浙江河北三省試辦。</p>
<p>（二）各通商大埠郵局設有支局者，電局得在郵政支局内設立收報處。電局設有分收發處者，郵局得在各該處内設立郵政支局。惟營業時間仍照所在局之營業時間爲凖。</p>
<p>（三）各通商大埠交部設有市内或長途電話者，電話局得在各郵局裝設公用電話。</p>
<p>（四）設有電局地方而尙未設有郵局者，電局内得設郵寄代辦所，由電局代辦　　　　　。</p>
<p>（五）各地郵電兩局尙未合設一處者，電局及話局均應代售郵票及收寄普通信件。</p>
<p>上述辦法大約兩個月内卽可陸續實行，此後各地民衆通訊，必大感便利也　　。</p>
<h3>鐵路電報免加過綫費</h3>
<p>鐵路車站代收及代轉電報，原爲便利未設電局而有車站各處民衆之通訊而設，惟此項鐵路電綫經轉電報除照電局價目收費外，每字尙須加收過綫費二分，似於發報人多所負擔。茲聞交部爲澈底便利民衆，並發展鐵路電報業務起見，已定自三月一日起，將該項加收之過綫費通飭各電局，並咨請鐵道部轉飭各車站，一律免收，俾與電局收費一律云。</p>
<h3>郵轉電報免收郵資</h3>
<p>交部近以郵轉電報本爲便利未設電局各處之民衆通訊而設，所有原來每電加收之郵資二角五分，亟應免收，俾偏僻城市之民衆，與大城市之民衆享同等利益。此項免收郵資辦法，聞交部已定自三月十五日起，郵局與電局一律實行云。</p>
<h3>局台來報電封預先印繕</h3>
<p>報務繁忙之電局電台，每日來報輒有一千或數百通以上，如電報之封套隨時開寫，則各報勢必多所稽延。交部現爲改進業務起見，聞已飭令繁忙局台對於來報多之商行或住戸，預先印妥或寫妥多數電封。分戸放置一特製之電封架上，以便隨時取用。此項辦法實行後，來報投送更可迅速異常云。</p>

<h3>標花晨跌午回</h3>
<p>丨新定棉花等級表丨</p>
<p>棉市晨跌午漲、但形勢尚硬、以各路來貨未見踴躍、人心尚佳、惟印棉仍落、故賣方依然抛出加碼、現棉交易不旺、前途若何、仍恃外棉伸縮也、歐洲政局不寗、美棉或受影響、因此有一部傾向抛空、就底盤而論、逢跌可進矣、</p>

<h3>糧食　蘇同粳略提半角</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來稀、計共二十餘號、（三千餘石各路銷塲則似較活絡、本街店胃自初市開手、形勢卽頗栗落、市况略能升色、惟因久疲之後、終覺無力、故共所納之蘇同帮粳行情、略提五分外、其餘常帮南港等粳及北洋尖等價、猶居定盤、悉無上落、客帮包胃雖銷而不强、但終以吃盤難鬆、遂致南北洋兩帮所進之青角松泗西練晚稻近二千包、市况仍惟平平耳、隂變元求無軒輊</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮到船十五六號、市上各貨銷胃尚佳、市形白粳杜尖早薄稻埠尖客尖價形定立、羊尖疲數分、</p>
<h3>本街暢辦客秈</h3>
<p>昨客秈客化其淡、但本銷甚旺、市面依然站住、後市以目下到銷兩平而論、形勢尚有一度盤旋、昨市客帮只有福州去紅糙三百包、寗波去紅糙二百包、其他均無問津、本街胃口反貪、全市辦去江西機早晚及紅糙砶靖沙市糙米南京糙米蕪湖無錫機秈共計二千七百餘包、行情與前市相似、</p>
<h3>黄豆市勢暫無變動</h3>
<p>昨黄豆市形平定、市價惟中下貨略緊一二分、廠家吃價有限、高貨出口有而不暢、市勢暫無變動、昨計成交正陽關豆三車、臨淮關豆二車、濉溪口豆三車、蚌埠豆四車、亳州豆三車、潁州豆三車、又大粒豆百餘包、肥河豆二車、</p>
<h3>糖市砂粗白回小五分</h3>
<p>昨糖市公會劃盤四二四粗砂白仍减十九元七角五分、但少問津、轉口高貨六元七角八分、成交百餘包、九號嗬　仍十五元九角、太古糖Ｂ嘜二十元零一角五分、比少五分、成交祗數十包、石門高片青開出百餘箱、價爲九元、潮青續開四百餘包、價自十一元五角十一元二角十一元十元零八角十元零五角、市象緊秀、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲銷轉機難</h3>
<p>（二底洋棧存絲益薄）本埠經營華絲出口洋行鑒於日絲在海外市塲廉價傾銷、華絲價仍難立住、對於囤積現絲均不敢冒險進行、去歳入冬以來、歐美各洋行均乏巨額期絲之購進、咸持隨購隨裝之旨、是以洋棧存絲益薄、昨爲二月底、分赴各洋行絲樓實地調查、悉共計廠白黄灰各絲經存額不滿八百包、其中預備運赴美洲者二百三十五包、運赴歐洲者三百五十三包、亞洲者一百九十包、</p>
<p>（輯里乾經運滬日减）浙湖所産之複摇經、（卽輯里經）自受日絲侵銷以來、上身輯里經美銷幾告絕跡、是以潯（南潯）震（震澤）産地各絲行大半停工、絲産日减、運滬寥落、上月中共祗裝到下身乾經二百四十七包、以應印莊（卽白頭洋行）需求、</p>
<h3>五金竹節鋼條走銷活潑</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條新近客銷甚爲活潑、故連日開出爲數有六七十噸之多、而本街建築帮交易亦頗興旺、數日來訂出亦有二百餘噸之鉅、行情二分元每噸一百三十元、三分元一百二十七元五角、方貨則統盤估一百十二元、比之先前均見進步、聞連日海外定價逐見步升、故本埠行情、恐一時不易回跌也云、</p>
<h3>瓦楞鐵内盤鬆動</h3>
<p>瓦楞鐵連日因走銷不廣、而到貨甚旺、兼之東洋貨大削其價、致英貨内盤行情亦步鬆動、如二十二號二十四號開十二元四角、三十六號十三元二角、二十八號十三元八角、比之先前多見下降、查近日祗有少許買賣、</p>

<h3>不知其味</h3>
<p>— 敦龐</p>
<p>前幾天，白燕先生談起鸕鶿，說他們雖然追逐游魚爲主人效力，自己却難得一飽。這使我記起「世說新語」中的一則：</p>
<p>「顧榮在洛陽，嘗應人請，覺行炙人有欲炙之色，因輟己施焉。同坐嗤之。榮曰：「豈有終日執之，而不知其味者乎」？後遭亂渡江，每經危急，常有一人左右己。問其所以，乃受炙人也。」</p>
<p>「終日執之而不知其味，」也可作鸕驚的考語。原來世上有這種的動物，本有這樣的人類，而顧榮却在前面加一個「豈有」，後面加一個「乎」，大驚小怪，徒見其少所見而已。</p>
<p>唐人有咏蜜蜂詩曰：「採得百花成蜜後，爲誰辛苦爲誰忙？」亦以喩勞動而無享受的人們。然而人間的勞動者决比不上鸕鶿和蜜蜂。</p>
<p>鸕鶿我也見過，牠們在捕魚以前雖難得一飽，但當工作完畢的時候，牠們是有得飽的。那時候，牠們和漁人一同心滿意足，分列在竹筏兩旁，振刷羽毛，「甲！甲！」地笑語着，頗得休息之樂。到家以後，主人並不要牠們做别項工作，牠們又没有種種生活上的憂慮，所以其實是很幸福的。</p>
<p>至於蜜蜂，則只要看牠們終日一面勞動，一面「嗡！嗡！」地吟詩，便像一羣「陶淵明」式的「農夫」。牠們的生産品雖被剥削，但在别的各方面，牠們並不陷於奴隸狀態。</p>
<p>而且，鸕鶿之於魚，蜜蜂之於蜜，到底不能說是「不知其味」的，卽使在被剥削的狀態之下，也還能嚐到一部分。若貴族們所享受的龍肝，鳳髓，山珍，海錯，做Ｂｏｙ的可眞無分。因此那個行炙人，受了顧榮的一餐之賜，遂感激不盡了。</p>
<p>顧榮的話，不過是一個不懂事的貴族的獃話，但也是今日尙不能解答的一個問題。</p>
<h3>讀書雜記</h3>
<p>— 袁澈</p>
<p>『饒｜命！』</p>
<p>他們的聲音是尖銳的。他們大半都是青年。</p>
<p>他們跳進砲彈洞去，蹲伏着。我們有幾個弟兄走到洞邊，便對那擁作一團的德軍射撃。有許多緊握着的手從烟囱形的坟墓裏伸出來作揖。手兒顫抖不住，表示求情乞憐。可是誰也没有一點憐惜之心。弟兄們向着那洞射撃。…</p>
<p>以上一段，是抄自哈里遜所著「將軍死在床上」的文章，讀時使我異常激動起來，不禁記起了另一件類此的更悲慘更可怕的事情。那是在幼年時候，聽見我的大舅父講的。他本人係由小兵出身，經過許多戰爭，才做到連長，「而他的生命，也在滇軍逼臨成都時，龍泉驛那一役喪失了的。雖是已死十多年，但他那大孩子一樣愛玩的風度，至今猶保存在我的記憶的深處哩。當他請假回來，碰着我在外祖母家的日子，他便把我和其他小孩，排立在一塊，喊着「向左轉」「向右轉」「臥下，前面敵人來了」，做兵操那樣有趣的游戲。這樂得我終日都把他纏着，就是他向外祖母她們講着戰塲的故事時，我也要橫臥在他的膝上，一面聽，一面搔摸他的手和下巴的。便在如此情景之中，我聽見了屠殺俘虜的慘劇，使我忘記不得。</p>
<p>他那時一提起滇軍，便是很憤慨的。他不呌他們做滇軍，只呌他們是「滇娃兒」，（雖是三個字，却應唸成兩個音，娃兒須拚在一塊讀）因爲，據他說，「滇娃兒」一捉住了他們這邊的弟兄，總是活活地用刺刀戳死，毫不放鬆的。所以他們對待那些解除了武裝的滇軍，便用着更慘更毒的方法，來瀉他們的仇恨。他說有一次在火綫上，圍來好些滇軍，他們不管那些可憐人，怎樣哀哀地告饒，只是瘋狂地向着嘴巴，向着眼睛，向着肚子，用刺刀亂戳。後來覺得還是不痛快，便有人提議，把剩下的那些嚇昏的俘虜，用繩子綁着足倒吊上樹去，高高地懸在空中。然後由一人攀登上樹，拿刀將俘虜的腸子，從肛門内挖了出來，拴在枝上，隨卽放鬆吊他的繩子，於是俘虜的身子，便很慢地墜落下來，而全血的腸子呢，使像一條索子似的，長長地掛在空中，俘虜是異樣地哀嚎着，奇慘地死去。大家復仇的心，這才歡快地滿足了。大舅父說到這裏，也搖頭說，這太慘酷點。外祖母，母親和姨娘她們，則嚇得打抖，連聲唸着阿彌陀佛　把這和哈里遜所寫的相比，中國人在殘殺這方面，無論如何是要比洋鬼子進步些，像這樣屠殺俘虜，只是其中一件小小的事情吧了。</p>
<h3>兩個自殺者</h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>還過去得不久，朱湘先生突然自殺了。以詩人兼大學敎授的他而自殺，論情理是應該在社會上激起一點波浪的。然而結果却輕悠悠地消失下去了，正如那抛在海中的碎石一樣。最近，艾霞女士又於人們都在闔家歡聚的爆竹聲中自殺了。就社會的習慣說，以一個身爲女子而又在作明星的她底自殺，是可以像黃慧如黃白英那樣聳動人們底視聽的。然而這消息却珔如舊歷的新年一樣，現在已經離我們遠了。也許是事件底本身没有故事的興味吧。從此，我們可以知道社會已經麻木到了何種的程度，而人們底自殺已經成爲一椿見慣不驚的尋常事件了。</p>
<p>但，朱湘先生們底自殺，尤其是像這樣兩個不同型的人各自以不同的出發點而走上相同的道路，不管怎樣總是一個值得思慮的社會問題，生在社會中的我們是應該加以深思熟慮的。</p>
<p>朱湘先生底生平，我不大知道。但，自從我在「文學」上見了他那篇「說作文」的文章以後就頗有一點爲他擔心了。因爲那種藝術至上的神秘見地，其結果不是有意識地損害了别人，就是無意識地斷送了自己。艾霞女士底生平，我也不大清楚，但據許多朋友說，她是一位比較進步而曾經和社會奮鬥過來的女子，萬不料終於還是從艱險的人生長途上開了小差。</p>
<p>據說：朱湘先生底自殺，主要的是爲了失業；艾霞女士底自殺，主要的是爲了失戀。失業與失戀，本來是人生中的兩大苦痛的源泉，但並非除了自殺以外就無别路。而且在事實上，也還有廣大的失業和失戀的人們在活着。所以，他們底自殺，自然應該由社會來負責任，但進一步的說明却不能不從他們底自身中去尋求。朱湘先生是一位詩人，而且是一位在他那環境中所稱許的天才詩人。詩人而有天才，當然是很可貴的，但如果自己也以爲自己是天才，覺得自己底一言一行都是宇宙社會底法則和眞理，结果便會脫離社會和人羣而走到無人居處的另一個世界去，而與社會和人羣隔得很遠的世界就是「死」。艾霞女士是會自己以爲自己是很聰明的，至少好那種只有人向她買好的環境是不會使她相信她是不聰明的，自然她就兩眼可以望着天空漫不經心地走着那些並非熟悉的路了。這樣地走路往往纔是會走到斜坡乃至懸崖上去而終於將自己跌死。一個聰明的女子，本來是有很好的前途的，而最大的可怕就是那聰明被她自負地賣弄使其反轉成了毁滅自己的東西。因爲在一種聰明底賣弄當中，她很容易使别人失掉自己，也很容易使自己失掉虽人，結果往往就同時使自己失掉了自己。這是我見得太多的世故，只希望艾霞女士並不是這樣！</p>
<p>一切近乎責備的話，亦不必說了。他們總算是拿出了他們底最後的生命來表明了他們那顆不會殺人只會自殺的善良的心。他們並不曾借取别人底生命來持續自己底生命。</p>
<p>自殺是怯懦的也是勇敢的，是值得非難的也是值得同情的。就社會的意義說：人雖然是自有其生命，但並不是爲了自身而存在，宇宙還在繼續不斷地成長，地球還在繼續不斷地運動，而人就是保延它們底生命的裔帶，一個人萬不能對人類社會不負責任。社會太黑暗了，應該努力使它光明；人類太可怕了，應當努力使它改善。卽使要死，最低限度也應該使那些造成黑暗的可怕的人先死如個在自己底前面。在生命的賭博中，死不是一筆最大的本錢嗎？所以一個人底自殺，是怯懦的也是值得非難的。但如果就個人的德行來說，有時却又是勇敢的也是值得同情的。自殺底本身就需要最大的勇氣，至少是表明了自己不能苟且偸安地生活下去。一個人，靜悄悄地活着又靜悄悄地死去，到底有什麽意味呢，更進一步說，並不是一切人都是有意義的生存着的：有些人是爲了生存也爲了意義，卽有意義地生存着並爲有意義的生存奮鬥，最後甚至抛棄了自己底生存去爭取意義；有些人却只是爲生存而不爲意義乃至毁叛一切的意義而罪惡地生存着。對於一個不能爲有意義的生存奮鬥或有意義地生存下去，但以並不企圖罪惡地生存下去的人，在消極方面自殺也未嘗不是他們一種善於自處的手段，這中間是可以包含着無數的悲哀和苦衷的。而且，當着一般人連死的自由都被剥奪了的時候，他們這種自己充分自由地處置自己底生死的行爲，或者在他們自身還以爲是一種反抗而感到滿足。我們能够再脫什麽嗎？不過，這畢竟缺乏了一點悲壯，卽是脫死得太不悲壯了。</p>
<p>正如前面說過的一樣，朱湘先生和艾霞女士雖然都走着自殺的道路，但他們底出發點是截然不同的；一個可以說是舊的當中那不能也許是不願吃人的一個，一個可以說是新的當中那不曾也許是不肯吃苦的一個，所以一個是因懹材不遇而自殺，一個是因心無鬥志而自殺。不待說，我們就此可以看出在新舊底鬥爭中那兩方面的不能急轉直下的人們底必然的命運，而朱湘先生和艾霞女士不過是站在較前面的兩個犧牲者。</p>
<p>現在這社會，天天都在繼續不斷地殺人，其實自殺的是很多的，那裏祇止朱湘先生和艾霞女士兩個！不過一般社會的習俗是只見着那浮在面上的事物。我不能免俗，故只就近提出他們兩人來說說，也可以莫是發表了我底意見。</p>
<h3>佛印湖</h3>
<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>這幾天來心裏頗不寗靜，無事時，常喜歡冥想。尤其是故鄕的佛印湖：那蒼翠的山光，澄碧的水色，時時深切地逗起我的懹戀。</p>
<p>當我在家時，每感到苦悶的當兒，就常喜約二三友人同到那裏去兜一個圈子。沿着坦平的湖濱馬路，在樹蔭下徐步着。嗅着那不知名的香草散佈的芬芳，覩着那燦爛的野花吐着的肥葩，心頭就感到非常的欣悅。</p>
<p>有時，或登臨山巓，遠眺曠野，見那如井的田疇，起伏的青翠的稻浪，以及隠在緑樹叢中寺院的一角紅牆，就好像讀着一首有韻的散文詩似的。在那裏，常喜流連很久很久，而不忍舉步回去。</p>
<p>清明時，兩旁山上的墳頭，飄着如帶的白紙。遠望好像青草叢中飛舞的粉蝶。有時，在蔚藍的天邊，釘上無數紙鳶的黑點，頗似夏晚的繁星。當陰暗天氣，山坳裏流出嫠婦的哀啼，那宛轉欲絕的聲音，在湖上蕩漾着，使這幽靜的湖山更添上無數的凄凉。</p>
<p>夏天，赤日似火燒般射在地面。但在佛印湖的柳蔭下，却仍很清凉。這時，就可以瞧見有不少的茶客，在傍山依水的柳蔭下，佔着一個座位；慢慢地品着清茶；懶懶地說着閒話。</p>
<p>我在苦熱的時候，也常喜跑到這裏來。先向湖濱的茶社泡一壼清茶，然後再在柳蔭下佔一張小几。隨着日影的移動而遷易我的位置。</p>
<p>水畔的垂柳，輕扇着微風；湖听游魚，喋接着水藻。在這幽靜的景况下，聽着孤寂的蟬嘶，心頭就不禁興起「富貴浮雲」之感。</p>
<p>有時，天氣雖不很煩熱，我也常喜跑到這裏來。對着一壼清茶，安閒地冥想；在這裏獨自個兒坐一個大半天。雖然我對於品茗是並無這種癖好。</p>
<h3>瑪麗·馬奇納夫的日記（四）Ｓｔｅｐｐｅｎ　Ｌｅａｃｏｌｔ作</h3>
<p>— 曄子譯</p>
<p>五天以後｜鄂多和我兩個人不願死！我們將一同逃走了，等亞歷克西到來的時候，我們已經遠了。不過，鄂多對我說，空手出走是不好的。因此，我每天拿一個包裹給我那騎士，呌他把這些包裹放在他的旅館中。前天，我把一隻首飾匣交給他。昨天聽了他的話，我把銀行中的存欵提出來，今天，他又聰明地呌我把我的爸爸和媽媽的紀念物偷出來……所以，在今天晚上，我打算趁爸爸睡熟的時候，把他的金錶拿到手；……等到明天，鄂多和我，我們兩人就將永遠離開這裏了。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>次日晚上｜｜我的心碎了！我所害怕的事突然發生了；…亞克西到來了。他和鄂多打架！……看那樣子眞可怕呀！……我和鄂多在牧塲上，忽然，亞歷克西出現了，他的身材本來高大，勢頭又很兇。我喊道：</p>
<p>「鄂多！我愛…走罷……不要殺他！」</p>
<p>鄂多猶豫了一會，就逃走了……他逃得多麽高尙！然而，亞歷克西追了上去。他們就打起來！……啊！多可怕的樣子！……亞歷克西抓住鄂多的腰圍，把他當作一塊石頭似的抛弄。</p>
<p>他的褲子碎裂了；鄂多跌落在草地上；亞歷克西用脚踢他，又把他拖起來，用一個木枷壓在他的肩上。然後，托起他的屁股，把他投入河中。我的可憐的鄂多開始在河中掙扎，把頭伸出枷外。</p>
<p>突然，亞歷克西轉身向我走來，把我挾着回到我家去，一面喃喃地講着情話。……</p>
<p>眞是要命！我將和亞歷克西結婚了，同時，那個可憐的鄂多的情形，闖入我的想像。我想到他帶着木枷在水中掙扎。河水將把他帶到第聶青，帶到布恪，帶到伏爾加，然後帶到裏海。但那個裏海和别的海並不　通，那末，鄂多也許來遠要在那裏面打滚了……我以碎了。我要哭了。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談離婚問題</h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>｜我贊同離婚，却非提倡離婚｜</p>
<p>一般人一聽見離婚這事就認爲是「離經叛道」，其實這是錯誤。確然，離婚在中國的歷史過程中，常時帶有悲劇的意味。然而我們當知道，這並不是離婚的本身，而是過去的社會制度加它的服飾。反之，離婚才是解除男女間的悲劇的，它才是現在我們男女間的福音。這也許會引人驚異。</p>
<p>本來依迁夫子們的思想看來，離婚誠然是「離徑叛道」，因爲他們腦筋中的社會是重禮敎的，女子的信條便是從一而終四字，婚姻的敎條是没有犯着破壤貞操，事長不敬等事就不會有離婚的事件。自然，這時候，假使你要離婚了，你妻子必然犯着那女子七條大罪的某一條，於是社會運用着它的制裁的權力，這女子便要開始受社會的種種虐待了。加之這種女子本没有單獨謀生的技能，而她的氏族方面除了一點可憐嫁妝外，又不能給她一點經濟的帮助。這離婚的結果確有點悲劇的味兒。我們確也感覺那般迂夫子們所感覺的也有些是處。</p>
<p>不過，這依然是支離破碎的。假使我們用着平靜的心去思考，我們仍然會發覺那般迂夫子們的愚蠢可憐。無論觀察，思想一個什麽事物，總應當逼立在這事物前，注視它。讓它眞確的實影，刻在我們心中，留下深刻的印象。再讓我們愼重的思考起來。這樣我們才可以鑽入這事物的核心，才可以了悉它眞正的面目。</p>
<p>這樣，我們回過頭來考察這目前的離婚問題。在男女的結合間，爲甚麽要發生離婚的現象呢？能這樣想，便算是逼對這問題的實面了。再推廣想着那星體的隕落，熟果的離枝，黨派的分歧，同盟國的戰鬥。繼之以推敲它們的原因。則我們一定可以知道，它們之所以要分離，是因爲在它們各自發展的過程中，發生了劇烈的衝突，這衝突一到絕無解决的餘地，便不能不分開了。循着這一樣的方式，就可去找男女結合間的矛盾。我們知道，在戀愛的階段中，情感常易掩飾個性。我們去觀察愛人，總是全力的去發掘她（或他）優美的地方，而全不在意於她的壤處。後來，便因着各人都感到對方是充滿了美處，各人都感到了滿足，於是便結合起來。在結婚後的生活中，不論男人或是女人，對於自己的個性，或本性上的　僻，就不不像在戀愛過程中那樣愼重的掩抑起來了。這裏便發生個性相合與不相合，優美之處能持續與不能授續的問題了。比如你是個有文學嗜好而又敏感的人，可是你的丈夫却是學科學的，他的腦筋只是Ｗ十Ｙ＝Ｘ，在你們的生活進程中，當然會因嗜好之不同而隔閡起來。好像你在你丈夫回來的時候，希望他能擁抱你一會；在睡覺之先，你願意他和你說一陣情話，而你的丈夫却認爲是最無聊而乏味的事情。好像你和你丈夫的談話之中，你談的是那一章詩，那一篇小說是如何的深刻，然而你丈夫所對你談的，却只是那解剖室裏的事情。再好像你是個愛潔爽，喜交際的，而你丈夫却邊幅不修，與世離絕。這許多，自然是你們性格不相持的地方了。這時候，假使你們同居得更久，你們的性格的發展就愈會使你們隔閡。於是本來是一對最親蜜，最親近的人，現在却成了最疏遠，最陌生不過的結合了。在這樣的疏隔，不關切的生活中，自然更會引起彼此的深重的痛苦的人，任便你站在那一種立塲上說，總不會在他的生命中，希望痛苦的生活與他永在的。反之，他却是最願意爲幸福而奮鬥。假使我們是處在這樣的一種男女結合的痛苦生活中，那我們捨了離婚之外，還有别的辦法没有？所以，我一談到這離婚問題，却有相當的贊成。我之所以贊成，是因爲在自然界不能强合强離，而在人類的男女間，也是不能强合强離的。不能合了，總是要離。如不順着這自然律的支配便只有無窮的痛苦。至於離婚對於女子不利，事實亦殊不對。一般之所謂不利，第一是再嫁之難，第二是兒女之累，關於再嫁之難這一點，一般人總以爲處女的身價，比非處女者高；再嫁之婦，總是有瑕之玉了。這，當然不值有識者一嗤，最下流不過了。他們理論的中心黠，不外以爲處女最能具有一種堅卓的贞操觀，而再嫁的女人好像是喪失了她貞操的保證了，貞操觀念是不是直接系於於處女膜呢？没有處女膜的女人就一定比處女放蕩，情愛不專麽？這是一種多麽可憐的笑話，我覺得對於這種意見，除了認爲是下流不堪，再没有别的話可說了。至於兒女的拖累，我覺得這是無問題之問題。因爲在離婚的敎條中，凡是先行提出離婚那方面，他是必然要擔負兒女的生活費。這種生活費的擔負，當然不是種社會的懲罰，而是種個人應盡的義務。爲了生活痛苦的解脫，精神鎖練的掙除，當然是應盡這種義務。</p>
<p>結語：我贊同離婚，却非提倡離婚。</p>
<h3>宿舍裏</h3>
<p>— 眉君</p>
<p>秋風是這樣的高爽，在近於荒郊裏，尤瀰漫着清幽的氣息，但未免看些凄寂而蕭條之態。我沉如死水的心波，每每會湧上莫名的浪濤，險約的如在嗚咽，是抑悶吧？</p>
<p>在中學裏是歡躍的想慕這所謂神聖的大學府，用盡了心力，才得遂了心願，居然的踏進了大學之門，帶着興奮，希奇，而又恐懼的心理在聽課。但是，開首就是分外使人不適，男同學們的眼光，比馬路上的白相人還可怕，無論是銳射，或者是默視，以至似溫柔的，都格外的刺人；高聲，低語，也不過令我感到他們的一舉一動，都相當的隠舊着一種可厭而可怖的，不可近之的味道。抱着熱誠，懹滿希望的新生活，開首了一個多月，已經淡淡乏味了。我說不出一個究意呵！</p>
<p>没有知心的友人可以訴說無限牢騷，只有或一來和日記見面，洩悶而稍暢心神。</p>
<p>我是極力想沉靜清定點，但週遭的氣味令人窒息，有些現象，眞有些古怪。</p>
<p>日間已感到没趣，想夜晚總較可以安適些兒，但是研究學識的大學宿舍，竟有點像上海市内的茶館或戲院一般的嘈雜，鬧得人厭倦了。不幸我們的女生宿舍是和男生絀舍爲鄰，晚上常常是從男宿舍那邊傳來喧鬧的聲音：不是幽清抑揚的歌聲，卽是不能成調的呌唱，而且每一種聲音，似乎都食有什麽深意般，這深意令人彷彿意識到有些可怕。雜着戲謔而銳利的哈哈大笑和喊呼，留聲機亦開起來，有時曲不成曲的廣東腔和京調一齊混起，聽不出什麽，只是一片不入耳之音。麻雀牌的聲音，幾乎亦可以聽到，不過不大清楚吧了。習以爲常的一到晚便如此開演着。我想，他們的書是怎樣在讀呢，學校當局在幹什麽的。這樣校風，不由人想到敎育神聖已經破産了。</p>
<p>今晚聽到他們那俗不可耐的歌：　　…只要你的心…</p>
<p>眞使人替他們難爲情哩。那個較文雅些的工會彈得琴來，可是，終覺不大入調，雖然我不懂琴，他們那些聲音，固然是討厭，但也似有一種什麽力量在着，更使人感到特别的鬰抑，有多少女同學弄得也没有心緒用功，只好低低的唱起歌來，有時我實在太悶了，也會不自覺的隨和他們幾聲，但總竟是無味。我的心魂，究意何處去？</p>
<p>昨晚的怪現象，我實在覺得嫌惡：同房有二位同學，似倒嘻笑自如，好像什麽挑動了她，是黃昏後，九時多的時分，凉快，清適的夜氣中，我安靜的在溫習我功課，忽然窗邊的床位的那二位女同學嘻笑而驚異的舉動，突擾動了我，抬頭一望，有一道電筒的白光，閃閃的從黑暗的窗外射進窗内來，一直照到靠近窗旁的臺子上。我一時十分驚怪，但一霎間我卽明白這道光是從男宿舍那邊射過來的，我轉而頓然呆住，到窗邉一看，隠約還可見到對面男宿舍窗内的幾個人影在蠕動的動着，好像在做什麽事情。我着實氣憤了，向同房女同學破口大駡這些所謂大學府的高等流氓。她們亦帶笑的指手劃脚在批評。我不等她們的意見如何，卽伸手把窗門關了起來，但還没有關好，對面那些男同學已傳出來一陣特别嚮亮而帶勝利的意味的笑聲。這一陣笑聲，是刺傷了我的心，我覺得突然的，我的兩頰在發熱，身亦奔騰特别快些，再也靜坐不下來，感到羞愧，難堪而又可怕，睡下去只是翻來復去，不能入夢，溫柔的被窩，舒適的氣味，都消失去了。細細相去，更加感到苦惱和失望，使我不能不懹疑這種生活。</p>
<p>熄燈後我仍是糢糊輾轉的不能成睡，漸漸的，似科幽靜多了。</p>
<p>醒來的時候，我的心緒不知怎樣更亂了些，抱着自己的頭，感到壓迫而又空虛。敲斷心絃的夜鐘一點……三點……</p>
<p>早上起來後，睡在窗邊的女同學，還告訴我說，窗門關了後，又有幾次再看到電筒發出來的光，在窗門的玻璃上徘徊，如果不是閃動的，也許會疑是月光呢。大約女同學也夜裏受了些兒擾擾，至是亦板着正經臉孔，駡那些够無聊的大學生。這種舉動是多麽野蠻而可畏呢！我加了一層被侮辱的感覺在心裏。</p>
<h3>電影明星與舞女</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>先前，我們對於電影明星和對於舞女總覺得有彼此之分，兩者在社會上的地位及價值有不可同日而語之處，至少電影明星比舞女稍勝一籌，就在一般人的心理中亦留下比較美滿的印象。到了目前，事實已大謬不然了，影片商人純粹抱着一種唯利主義，無往而不利用明星的大腿胸作爲招徠生意的招牌，試一留心每日的新聞紙，肉麻肉感的大幅廣告觸目皆是，這種性慾主義的虱行不獨中國爲然。歐美影界尤其有過無不及。本　在這資本主義社會裏頭，任何畢業都免不了商品化，影片商爲要增加營業上的進益起見，遂競相傚尤，標奇立異，愈下流愈妙，藉此博取一斑低級趣味的小市民層，由是肉麻的製片大批産生，電影空氣被攪得臭氣薰天自然不在話下了。</p>
<p>而女明星之樂得犧牲色相是無可諱言的事，正因爲女明星能够犧牲色相，大腹便便的老閭不愁生財無術，女明星降至如今這個田地，比之以一塊錢擁抱的舞女只是五十步與一百步之差，我們不妨舉出一二件事來作說明，前者有大華舞女李麗的走上銀幕，結果還是回到爵士音樂的環境中過其原來生涯，最近則有曾令人嘖嘖稱怪的梁賽珍由銀幕生涯改行爲舞女，他們都說是因爲明星的入息遠不如舞女多多，爲滿足的供給，祇有走此一條路。這都是由哀之言，痛快的說話。其實由明星而舞女，與科由舞女而明星，要之不外是個人一種生活環境的變遷，有何值得稱怪。况且一切人的思想行動根本就不能擺脫經濟力的支配，爲要求得一個較適舒的生活而改換其生活方式，苟不論其所改換的新生活爲如休，但我們斷不可從表面上而决定其行爲是錯誤或堕落，而應該就客觀條件去加以批評。許多奔逐於夜街頭賣淫賣笑的女人，何能够單純非難是她自己甘願堕落嗎？那些堕落的人們並不是他們自願堕落。而是客觀的事實使然。</p>
<p>老實說，在目前電影明星與舞女是一而二，二而一的，世界經濟恐慌的浪頭席捲了全球，電影事業的衰敗日甚一日，從事電影的明星們莫不深感地位的動搖舉未來的厄運。世界薪俸最高的好萊塢的一般明星，尙發生生活的恐慌，其他更不言可喩了。作爲遊閒階級迷宫的跳舞廳，如某紳士階級資産階級一日未崩潰，舞廳終是一日不會消滅的，長此以後，一般無出路的明星，也許都會相繼羣趨於舞女之一途，也未可知咧。</p>
<h3>打的門檻</h3>
<p>— 陶誕</p>
<p>「打」，似乎是野蠻的；可是在這只有强權，没有公理的現代，倒反不如利用武力，能佔着一些便宜。同時；「打」也是必需的。在怨恨的時候，想要人百不打，時常會在身體上弄出毛病。所以從前有一批有錢的老爺太太們｜現在還有，長買了許多了頭，預備在自己不愉快的時候，做發洩怒的架子。所以我說：可以打人時，打打何妨？不過，打有打的門檻，門檻不精的，不但打不着人，也許反要挨打，打人者，可不愼乎？</p>
<p>打有打的目標，打人的，切不可不自量力，胡亂動手。你必須明瞭「知己知彼，百戰百勝，」的原理，你須備有　，你先應當自己忖度一下，你能吃得他的回手不能？所以業於個子大一點的，身材高一點的人物，你還是採「長期抵抗」的方法，退讓一步爲妙，所謂態度鎭靜，沉着應戰，免吃眼前虧。反之；碰着拳頭發癢的時候，看到了癆病鬼，鴉片鬼等等，甚至於婦人孺子，那一批弱小民族，就不妨撈起袖口，扳出拳頭，顯一顯身手，我敢保險使你不致吃虧。</p>
<p>說起打，就免不掉聯想到駡。要打人了，那就必須先駡，這也是有理由的。好像雙方開戰，在没有動兵以前，必先有一番通電宣言，歷陳對方的罪跡，使别人都相信我們是爲正義而犧牲。打前必駡，也就是同一原理。那末，使旁觀者都能批評對方的不好，說你是有理的。就是他眞的没有十分錯，你也不妨捉着他一件小事｜不干你也不要緊，就小題大做，信口瞎說，只要駡得響就是了。</p>
<p>也許你在没有動手以前，已經害怕，這簡直是懦夫的行爲。其實，是用不着担憂的。反正你打輸了，就老着臉皮，對對方握握手，慶祝他的成功。對觀衆呢？就不妨說：「勝敗乃兵家常事，豈足道哉？何况失敗又是成功之母，試看明年的這一天罷。」明年的這一天，乃當然還是不來爲妙，大丈夫志在四方，遠而避之，又何不可。進一步說，萬一你眞的爲了打人，犧牲了性命，那也没有什麽道理的，十六年後，還不另是一條好漢？</p>
<p>最後：我先聲明！我對於打，雖是没有經騐，但這一大段門檻，在理論上，我敢說是可以成立的；你們不相信的，不妨試一試看。至於打出了人命官司，那是你的拳頭一靈，我不能負責。</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>這也要自殺嗎！</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是北平人，茲有難題，亟待指示迷津，請在業餘信箱欄答覆。</p>
<p>一個弱小的女子甲，今年十九歲，當很小很小的時候，由父母說與一個親戚乙爲妻。後來他們時常見面，覺得未婚夫非常粗魯，尤其那個强硬的性情，因此，她自定婚以來，始終没有她的未婚夫，在她腦海之中。她悲哀極了，恒有死志，她主張無論如何，總不能嫁他，乙是我的至友，我對他有相當的感情。所以先前我就勸甲不要趨於極端，但是毫無效果。可是甲對我却非常鍾情，常常表示願與乙解約，而嫁我。我因爲受她的好感，並且各方面細察，覺得她良心好，加之一天一天的接近，最近已逹愛情最高峯的時期。她的父母，也是同意於我，我們倆，口頭亦已訂婚了，她的父母也贊成了。假使我不認識乙的話，當然不成問題。然而假使我不與甲結婚，甲事實上也要另找對偶，卽勉强結婚，最後也要離婚：因爲甲未愛我之前，正在物色對偶，並且已有决心，死不結婚，以正名分，以便另圖。所以我覺得事實上没有對不起乙的地方，然而告訴乙，我不是一個朋友，但若因此離甲，則尙有對不起甲的地方。我現在處於極困難的境遇，又愛甲，又怕對不起乙，所以萌了厭世之念，到首都中國大旅社開了房間，凖備一死，以謝甲乙。然而我是個弱者，到此二天，猶疑不决，看見貴報的業餘信箱，又有偸生之念，萬一你們能夫我出一個好主意，或者尙有苟活的希望，望你速覆　在報上覆，我姓程，名字恕不予宣佈出來，則感謝隆情，恩同再造矣。另有小問題三段，亦請一併答覆。</p>
<p>（一）我對甲和乙是愛情神聖呀？是顧全友誼呢？</p>
<p>（二）如應以愛情爲重，固然須犧牲這個朋友，不與往來，然仍想與他往來，有妙法否？</p>
<p>（三）甲乙俱是我的朋友，設此難題爲甲所問，則甲對乙，及對我，應如何呢？請代甲設身處地而指導之。</p>
<p>程啓二月二十日於首都中　　　　　　　　　　國大旅社</p>
<p>答：程君，不要去自殺，這是無需自殺，而且人根本用不着自殺的，雖則編者所供獻你的辦法，或許不是個最好的辦法，但辦法，祇要你極力去找，終究是有的，何必要從自殺方面着想呢？</p>
<p>結婚總要以愛情爲基礎，這是事實，不是理想。來函所請的「女子學」，她已經一點都不愛「乙」，那末，她嫁一「乙」，當然她本人不消說是葬送了，然</p>

<h3>Takeover of Gubeikou Postponed</h3>
<p>｜Temporarily Postponed to March 4｜</p>
<p>Reasons Being:</p>
<p>Japanese Troop Rotation Not Yet Completed</p>
<p>Addresses of Various Agencies Undetermined</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng Returns to Beiping with Liu Youxun and Huo Shi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Yin Rugeng met with Matsui in Gubeikou on the 26th, due to the incomplete troop rotation between the Ogawa Regiment of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army and the Nagami Regiment of the 7th Division, and the undetermined addresses of agencies such as the Sasaki Bureau and the Public Security Bureau, it was decided to postpone the takeover to March 4th. There are currently over two hundred Japanese troops stationed in Gubeikou, more than eighty puppet border police, and eight or nine Japanese military police. A puppet border police office is also located at the foot of Nantianguan slope. Inspections of passersby are very strict. Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping tonight with Liu Youxun and Huo Shi, and will go again on the 3rd to handle the matter. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng left Gubeikou this afternoon and arrived in Beiping this evening. Due to the Japanese agencies not being withdrawn from Gubeikou, the takeover is postponed to March 4th. Japanese representative Matsui also returned to Chengde on the 28th and will return to Gubeikou on the 4th. Except for the two eastern passes of the five small passes nearby where Japanese troops are stationed, the rest have been recovered by us. At Nantianguan Gubeikou, pedestrians are inspected very strictly after 8 PM. The troop rotation between the 8th and 7th Divisions of the Japanese Army should be completed within a week. The thirty members of the War Zone Security Team transferred by us are temporarily stationed in Shixia Town and will be sent to Gubeikou after the takeover. When Yin Rugeng arrived, the public welcomed him with lanterns and dragon dances. A group of Chinese traitors in Gubeikou agitated the Japanese to oppose our takeover, so the Japanese side also seemed hesitant. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a phone call from Miyun, Yin Rugeng secretly went to Chengde on the 26th to visit Matsui, but did not meet him. He returned to Gubeikou on the 27th and returned to Beiping in the afternoon. The postponement of the takeover of Gubeikou was originally due to the one-day enthronement of the Japanese puppet government, and there were no responsible Japanese personnel to handle it. The takeover on March 4th is also just a verbal agreement, and it is still difficult to predict whether it can be handled as scheduled. Currently, only Guan Qinghua, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and two attendants are left in Gubeikou to negotiate everything. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Gubeikou was not returned to China this morning. The Japanese military authorities requested a postponement of the handover ceremony because the military barracks were not yet completed, so it has been postponed to March 4th. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Cables Various Counties, Setting a Deadline for Eliminating Opium Seedlings</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Provincial Government cabled various counties, setting a deadline of twenty days to eliminate opium seedlings, and requiring the county magistrate to be responsible for reporting. Personnel will be sent to investigate. If there is any falsehood, severe punishment will be imposed immediately upon discovery. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>The 7th Route Army Has Been Organized</h3>
<p>Transferred to Henan for Training by Liu Zhi</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: The former 19th Route Army has been reorganized by order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek by Wei Lihuang into the 7th Route Army, comprising four divisions with three regiments each. The organization is now complete. The division and regimental commanders will be determined by the military authorities, and fixed numbers will be assigned. The Ministry of Military Affairs will submit a formal appointment in the coming days. The commanders are: 49th Division Commander Wu Chengren, 60th Division Commander Chen Pei, 61st Division Commander Yang Bufei, and 78th Division Commander Wen Chaoji. All divisions have now been transferred to Henan for training by Liu Zhi, and will be assigned other tasks after three months. (Central News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Decides to Approve Silver Agreement</h3>
<p>The Issue of the United States Raising Silver Prices</p>
<p>To be Properly Addressed by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In addition to resolving to approve the Silver Agreement, the Central Political Council on the 28th also made specific decisions on stabilizing silver prices and preventing the export of raw silver. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Silver Agreement, the Central Political Council held a review meeting on the 27th. It was generally agreed that the effect of the agreement was to stabilize silver prices and seek international exchange stability, and that the government should approve joining. As for the US raising silver prices, this is another issue, and the Executive Yuan should entrust proper countermeasures to effectively prevent it. A review opinion was drafted and submitted by the Standing Committee for discussion at the Central Political Council on the 28th. After a long period of research, it was decided to pass it according to the review opinion and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan meeting in two days can bring it up for discussion. (Central News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi took the train to Shanghai on the night of the 20th. It is said that after careful research by various committees at the review meeting on the 27th regarding the Silver Agreement, opinions were signed and submitted for discussion at the Central Political Council on the 28th, and it has been resolved to pass it and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that the Silver Agreement was approved by the Central Political Council on the 28th. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Jiangle</h3>
<p>Chiang Orders Recovery of County Seat in Three Days</p>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Army in Western Fujian Presses on Changting</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Military News: The fighting in Jiangle is fierce. Chairman Chiang cabled General Sun to recover the county seat of Jiangle County within three days. The bandits of Gaotan Shuinan under Jiang were defeated by the 264th Route Army on the 27th. The large bandit suppression army in western Fujian has now made contact with the various armies in northern Fujian and is pressing on Changting. Wei Lihuang will go to Xiamen today to meet Chiang Ting-wen and then go to Longyan to establish the forward headquarters. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The two divisions of Leng Xin and Lu Xingbang completely recovered Sha County on the 25th.

The trenches made by Sun's army have all been destroyed by the Ningyuan army. Also, Sun's army is currently digging tunnels against the city wall of Ningyuan, but the work is difficult due to the frozen soil.

Currently, they are still suppressing bandits, asking the provincial government for money, and disobeying the provincial government's orders, which is very strange. Also, each county in the war zone used to have ten districts, which was too large. A method has now been drafted to merge them in the field to reduce governance. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

The security was extremely tight. Li Zongren is said to be coming to Guangdong in two days to meet with Chiang.

After arriving in Guangdong, he consulted with various military and political leaders and has had considerable results. He plans to return to Xiamen by plane on the 2nd. The military affairs of the Eastern Route are now aimed at developing in the northwest. Because the main force of the bandits is gathered there, the bandit suppression troops of this route have begun to concentrate.

The Central army will take over the defense of Longyan, Zhangping, Ningyang, and Liancheng and can mobilize within a week. It is rumored that a certain Wen from the southwest committee is the director of the Post-War Relief Office in southern Fujian, but this is not the case. Currently, the militias Peng Tangzong are attacking Yongchun in two directions, one occupying Dabao and the other holding a standoff in Xiaohu. The fighting is very fierce. The 3rd Division of Zhangzhou has concentrated and can set out to Longyan in three days. There is no Central army in Longyan yet.

According to Chiang's words, public order in Fujian Province is gradually recovering, and post-war reconstruction work is currently underway. The public views Chiang's arrival in Guangdong as extremely important, as it proves that the tense situation between Nanjing and Guangdong is gradually easing. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Political Commentary</p>
<h3>The Return of Yuguan and Gubeikou</h3>
<p>In late May of last year, China and Japan signed the Tanggu Truce Agreement. Our troops withdrew to the area west and south of the line connecting Yanqing and Lutai, while the Japanese army continued to occupy the war zone and did not immediately comply with the agreement to "return to the line of the Great Wall." After repeated negotiations by our side, Yuguan was handed over on February 9th of this year, and Gubeikou was scheduled to be handed over on February 28th. Yuguan had been occupied for one year and thirty-seven days from the time it fell to the time it was recovered. Gubeikou had also been occupied for more than eight months. There are no fewer than sixteen passes on the Great Wall, large and small. Among them, the Japanese have built barracks in five major passes such as Panjiakou, Lengkou, Jiumenkou, Yiyuan Kou, and Jielingkou, citing the instability of the bandit atmosphere as an excuse for refusing to withdraw at the same time, which is obviously inconsistent with the agreement. In the Yuguan area, in addition to the original Japanese troops stationed there according to the Boxer Protocol, the remaining troops have been moved, but the barracks outside the city south of the railway have been greatly expanded and can garrison more than a division. Before the move, they also threatened to return at any time. The Japanese army in Gubeikou also said that there were no suitable houses outside the pass and refused to withdraw immediately. Their intention was to build barracks in Qingshiliang outside the pass and move there after the construction was completed. Judging from their arrangements, they all have deep intentions. If there is an emergency, the Japanese troops in the two places are close at hand and can arrive in an instant. The so-called troop withdrawal is just deceiving people.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual situation of the recovery of the two places, it is even more difficult for us to be optimistic immediately. Not only have the puppet Manchukuo agencies such as post offices and customs not been eliminated quickly, but they also seem to be on equal footing with us. Even the administrative power and police power that are said to have been returned have been stripped away, which is not enough to say that the territory is intact. Our police stationed in Yuguan are still holding wooden sticks on guard, while the puppet police are fully armed and strutting through the city every day, which cannot but make people feel that the guest is taking over the role of the host. Although Tao Shangming has repeatedly negotiated this matter, the Japanese side only allows the Chinese police to be equipped with short swords and pistols and absolutely not to use large guns. The number of pistols is also limited to 50. It is feared that Japanese and Korean thugs will cause trouble in the area after the takeover, and fifty pistols are hardly enough to maintain public order and even less to prevent bandits. The Japanese side also requires that the number of police and security teams stationed by our side in Gubeikou and the number of guns be limited, intending not to exceed 500 people, and that the police on duty not carry guns. It is speculated that the Japanese side intends to limit our ability to maintain public order and indirectly cultivate bandits in order to leave room for them to interfere at any time. Moreover, it is said that Japanese thugs and Japanese military police in Yuguan are constantly entering and leaving the Public Security Bureau and the county government to investigate our measures. Although our side cannot bear the trouble, we cannot refuse. From all this, we can see a glimpse of the Japanese people's intentions. We should not be satisfied with the beauty of the handover.</p>
<p>Given the disparity in strength between China and Japan and the low credibility of the Japanese side, what can we do if the various passes of the Great Wall are captured by the enemy and not returned for a long time? Why would the Japanese be willing to show us favor and actually return Yuguan and Gubeikou? According to our observations, there are probably two reasons: First, to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment in various quarters; and second, to lure our country to negotiate with them on issues such as through traffic and postal services between inside and outside the Customs in order to de facto recognize the hatred of the puppet Manchukuo. Let us discuss them separately.</p>
<p>Since Japan occupied our four northeastern provinces, its policy toward China has obviously undergone a change. Before this, its purpose was primarily to encompass the resources and sovereignty of the Northeast. After this, it primarily aimed to seize the market inside the Customs. Now that the purpose of occupying the Northeast has been achieved, and the anti-Japanese wave among Chinese has gradually subsided, for the Japanese people, it is appropriate to avoid military action and cultivate the purchasing power of our market inside the Customs to be the tailwater of Japanese goods dumping. Moreover, Japan's international diplomacy has long fallen into a state of isolation and helplessness. If it does not make every effort to narrow the scope of its armed actions in China, it will inevitably promote a united front of all parties to deal with the common enemy, and Japan will be on the verge of danger. Guangtian, the new foreign minister, said in his speech on diplomatic policy, "China's rapid recovery of its security and prosperity is the sincere hope of the empire." Its intention is probably to open up a diplomatic outlet on the one hand and recover the Chinese market on the other. It is a true expression of its internal psychology to take a two-pronged approach and take care of everything.</p>
<p>The Japanese side is eager to resolve issues such as through traffic and postal services between inside and outside the Customs as soon as possible. In the past few months, it has repeatedly encouraged our side to directly negotiate with the puppet Manchukuo to make us de facto recognize the puppet state as the precursor to other countries recognizing it one by one. Fortunately, our side's attitude is firm, and although there was an initial contact, it eventually stopped. Recently, the Japanese side, because Yuguan and Gubeikou have been returned, believes that events such as through traffic and postal services can continue to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the Japanese side's handover of the two places are nothing more than the above. Now, we want to tell the national public: (1) Under the current environment, when negotiating the recovery of lost territory, it is in the interest of the authorities to seek perfection. However, various parties have already been skeptical of our signing of the Tanggu Truce Agreement. If the conditions originally stipulated in the agreement cannot be fulfilled by the Japanese people one by one, how can we comfort the hopes of our people? For the authorities, they should continue to work hard to demand that the Japanese people return all the passes of the Great Wall and strive to get rid of the restrictions on our administrative and police powers regarding the recovery of various places. (2) We should continue to adhere to our past attitude on events such as through traffic and postal services with the puppet Manchukuo to avoid the suspicion of de facto recognizing the puppet organization. Previously, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance planned to send personnel to inspect and proceed as appropriate. However, because public opinion indicated that this matter was similar to establishing customs duties on the border and its abuses were no different from through traffic and postal services, the matter was terminated. From now on, we hope that our authorities will continue to respect public opinion and consider diplomacy and not lose sight of the big picture because of small things. (3) When the contacts between the recovered passes and the interior are well strengthened, setting up long-distance telephones and opening up highways are particularly urgent. It is necessary to proceed as soon as possible without delay. (4) It should be recognized that the return of Yuguan and Gubeikou is the result of the Japanese side fulfilling the Tanggu Truce Agreement and changing its diplomatic policy toward China. We should never be complacent about it. Before the entire China-Japan issue is resolved, we should always hold on to the original intention of recovering the Northeast and strive to implement it.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Russo-Japanese relations have suddenly turned sour. News arrived in Tokyo this morning that Russian troops shot down a Japanese military aircraft on February 17th at the confluence of the Amur and Songhua Rivers. However, details of the incident vary. Some say that everyone on board was killed, while others say that there were no casualties. Another report suggests that it is unknown which country's people shot down the Japanese aircraft. The Ministry of the Army stated regarding this matter that it has not yet received an official report, but a ministry spokesman said that Russian planes flew over the Korean border twice, on February 23rd and 25th. (February 28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry has now learned that the strange aircraft that flew over the northern Korean border on the 23rd was a Soviet Russian plane. Therefore, today it sent a telegram to Ambassador Ota, instructing him to call the Moscow government to serious attention. (February 28th, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Hunchun Consulate to the Foreign Ministry, at 11:00 AM on the 24th, eight cavalrymen from Kropotkin suddenly crossed the border, invading Tiandaopaozi in "Manchukuo" and investigating the terrain in that area before leaving. Recently, with the arrival of strange planes and the invasion of cavalry, the actions of the Soviet side have been quite active, causing anxiety among the Korean people. (February 28th Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, strange aircraft have frequently flown over Jilin and northern Korea. The Foreign Ministry telegraphed the Governor-General of Korea, requesting an investigation into the truth of the matter and an immediate report. According to their report today, at 3:30 AM on the 23rd, aircraft flew over Gyeongwon, Sinheung, Gyeongseong, Unggi, and Najin in Hamgyeongbuk-do. At 5:30 AM, they entered Hunchun County and flew towards the Soviet Union. At 3:00 PM on the 25th, an aircraft appeared over Liudaogou in "Manchukuo" on the opposite bank of Gyeongseong, and flew through Qidaogou and Badaogou towards the Soviet Union from Hedaogou. The Foreign Ministry plans to investigate further and, if the strange aircraft indeed belong to Soviet Russia, will lodge a protest. (February 28th Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an official military report, on February 23rd, Russian troops used machine guns to fire at a Japanese aircraft scouting near the confluence of the Amur and Songhua Rivers. The aircraft was participating in "bandit suppression" operations at the time. It is reported that the pilot only suffered minor injuries, and the fuselage had a bullet hole. It is also reported that a similar incident occurred on February 12th, but the aircraft was undamaged. (February 28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Foreign Ministry ordered the Japanese ambassador in Moscow to protest the Soviet Russian aircraft's actions of flying over the Korean border, the Ministry of the Army does not attach much importance to this matter. Furthermore, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of the Army speaking to a Reuters reporter, the Ministry of the Army also does not attach importance to the matter of Russian troops firing at the Japanese aircraft, because the soldiers operating the machine guns may have mistakenly thought that the Japanese aircraft had crossed the border and therefore opened fire.

<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the Anglo-Japanese textile negotiations have now reached a very complex stage. However, British representatives deny reports that the discussions have been suspended. It is reported that both sides will convene at the Ministry of Commerce and strive to find a way out. The Japanese delegation frequently contacts Tokyo, while the British representatives have held several secret meetings to discuss the points of contention. If the negotiations break down, calls for boycotting Japanese goods in the British market will likely intensify, and the matter may be handled through diplomatic channels.

<h3>Japanese House of Peers Urgent Interpellation of Education Minister Hatoyama</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Saito Replied That He Will Deal with It Soon</p>
<p>Hatoyama Expressed Intent to Find a Good Solution</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's plenary session of the House of Peers began at 10:42 AM. First, Mr. Otsuka Koreshige addressed the chamber regarding</p>
<p>Then, listing various inauspicious events in education, he began his interpellation, saying,</p>
<p>Any one of these events is enough to impeach the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. We do not have the time to discuss each of these events in detail, because there are even more urgent issues at hand. We have read extremely severe and dishonorable criticisms of Education Minister Hatoyama in the newspapers. Moreover, according to Mr. Okamoto Ikki's speeches in the House of Representatives on February 8th and 15th, it is a regrettable thing that the Education Minister himself, in the position of an elder statesman of the academic world, was found at an inquiry. This is also regrettable for the Saito Cabinet. His Majesty the Emperor is extremely concerned about education. How should the Education Minister feel about this in his heart? If the Education Minister can clear away the doubts and make the situation clear to the education world, it would be something that the entire nation would eagerly desire. I hope that Prime Minister Saito will handle this matter decisively.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito answered,</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Education Minister Hatoyama, various rumors have been circulating, and the matter has become an issue in the House of Representatives. Even a special committee has been established. It is appropriate to wait until the results are clear before taking appropriate action.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Otsuka still wanted to pursue the matter, but due to the order of speaking, Mr. Nomura Tokushichi questioned him, saying,</p>
<p>I also agree with Mr. Otsuka's question. Please ask Education Minister Hatoyama to give a clear explanation.</p>
<p>Education Minister Hatoyama ascended the platform and answered with extreme caution, as follows:</p>
<p>I have not met Mr. Nomura in these past few years. I originally did not intend to say a word regarding Mr. Otsuka's speech. However, now that I have been moved by Mr. Nomura, I must make a brief statement. Recently, criticisms of me have been prevalent in society. I am deeply concerned that this will have a great impact on the education world. Therefore, I intend to approach this matter with a clear and calm mind and find a good solution. The meeting adjourned at 11:42 AM. (February 28th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

He also departed on the ship. (February 28th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Former French Education Minister's Travels in the Far East</h3>
<p>Lectures in China and Japan Did Not Involve Politics</p>
<p>Marseilles: French Senator Anatole de Monzie, former Minister of Education and initiator of the Cité Universitaire in Paris, was invited to give lectures in China and Japan last month. He recently returned to Marseilles aboard a French mail ship and issued a statement to our correspondent, recounting his lectures in Tokyo and Kyoto, saying, "My lectures in Japan did not involve politics in order to avoid causing disputes. I only expounded a noble concept, which is the mutual understanding of outstanding individuals from various countries to seek the cooperation of all nations. At present, the whole world is plagued by economic depression, and the cause of the depression is mostly due to misunderstandings and divisions among nations. To eliminate these misunderstandings and divisions requires the joint efforts of intellectuals from the East and the West. Japanese intellectuals warmly supported my proposal, which greatly moved me. After leaving Japan, I went to Beijing and Shanghai, where I was welcomed everywhere. I met with a large number of important Chinese officials. They are familiar with Western culture and all said that it is a pity that the Far East and the West have long been separated by misunderstandings. I then pointed out to them the contribution of the Cité Universitaire in Paris to bridging the feelings of students from various countries." (Note: The Cité Universitaire in Paris is located in the suburbs of Paris and has dormitories for students from various countries at the University of Paris.) "I am confident that the lectures I gave in China will have the same effect as in Japan." Anatole de Monzie is scheduled to depart from here for Paris tonight.

<h3>British Political Parties Dissatisfied with Current Cabinet Policies</h3>
<p>(London) Opposition to Foreign Secretary Simon's strategy has ended, but unrest continues within the various political parties. The Liberal Party and the extreme Conservatives are extremely dissatisfied with Prime Minister MacDonald. Both sides are criticizing the Prime Minister's social policies and his attitude on the issue of disarmament, but for different reasons. (February 28th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Budget Bill Passed by Senate in its Entirety</h3>
<p>Returned to the Chamber of Deputies for Reconsideration</p>
<p>New Cabinet Overcomes Current Difficulties</p>
<p>(Paris) The hope of new Prime Minister Doumergue that the budget bill for the current period would be passed by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate before March 1st has now been realized. After being passed by the Chamber of Deputies, the budget bill was submitted to the Senate today, where it was passed by a large majority of 296 votes to 13. However, it was accompanied by several amendments that will be sent back to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion. These amendments do not seem to pose any difficulties. The speedy passage of this bill was due to the fact that both houses approved the entire vote without voting on each item. Doumergue has thus overcome a major current difficulty. The reason why previous cabinets collapsed shortly after being formed was their failure to overcome this difficulty. (February 27th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate today approved the government's full power to cut political expenses by order before June 30th by a vote of 277 to 19. Prime Minister Doumergue stated that he would resign if he did not obtain full power, hence the Senate's vote. (February 27th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Startling New Discoveries in French Swindle Case Continue</h3>
<p>Involving Many Important Political Figures</p>
<p>Hubert Pierlot Also Among Those Implicated</p>
<p>Investigative Committee Has Begun Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Dismissed</p>
<p>(Paris) The waves of the French Stavisky scandal have now resurfaced, affecting many important political figures who were previously considered beyond suspicion. Today was the first meeting of the parliamentary Stavisky case review committee, and startling facts were discovered when they examined the documents related to the case. According to Stavisky's wife, Stavisky had lunch with former Minister of Commerce Durand in a large restaurant, but Durand still insists that he had no prior acquaintance with Stavisky. When Durand was in office, he advised insurance companies to purchase fake bonds from Bayonne in an official document. Furthermore, Stavisky's wife said that former Finance Minister Pierre-Étienne Flandin also dined with her husband at the Stresa Conference, but Flandin also denies ever seeing Stavisky. In addition, the owner of the L'Éclair newspaper, Dubarry, received a large amount of funding from Stavisky, and the newspaper has now been ordered to cease publication. However, Dubarry stated today during questioning by the parliamentary committee that the person who first introduced him to Stavisky was former Prime Minister Chautemps. Furthermore, the committee reviewed the number of checks issued by Stavisky during his lifetime, totaling as many as 800. Although only a portion has been collected, the names on them are already shocking. Apart from the 40 million francs that Stavisky spent himself, the banker Homer received as much as seven to eight million, and Stavisky's secretary Romaniello also received this amount. In addition, the amounts received by business tycoons, members of the Chamber of Deputies, and important political figures were also in the millions of francs, showing how lavishly Stavisky spent his money during his lifetime. (February 27th, Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The parliamentary committee investigating the responsibility for the February 6th incident worked actively this afternoon. It was decided to obtain various documents on Thursday, examine them first, and then summon various witnesses for questioning next week, such as former Paris Police Chief Chiappe, former Prime Minister Chautemps, former Director of the Judicial Police Gischia, and former Director of the National Detective Squad Domegue. As a rule, civil servants are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of matters within their duties. The government has now allowed the parliamentary investigation committee to allow civil servants who are summoned to testify before the committee not to maintain confidentiality. (February 27th, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Stavisky swindle case has been postponed for trial nineteen times. The committee responsible for investigating this matter has submitted a report, determining that the prosecutor of the Seine department, Pressard (the brother-in-law of former Prime Minister Chautemps), committed errors in his duties and should bear major responsibility. The Council of Ministers met at 9:00 PM tonight, and Minister of Justice Henry Chéron presented the report to the cabinet for review and asked President Lebrun to sign two orders, one to cancel the order appointing Pressard as a judge of the Supreme Court on February 3rd, and the other to appoint the public prosecutor of the Paris Court, Gommier, to replace Pressard as the prosecutor of the Seine department. As for Pressard, he will be appointed to another position. (February 27th, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Three Defendants in German Reichstag Fire Released</h3>
<p>Naturalized as Russian Citizens</p>
<p>Arrived in Moscow and Were Welcomed</p>
<p>(Moscow) The defendants in the German Reichstag fire, Dimitrov, Popov, and Tanev, members of the Bulgarian Communist Party, were released from prison in Berlin and immediately flew to Russia. With the prior permission of the Russian authorities, they were naturalized as Russian citizens. When the three arrived at the airport here today, the crowd cheered, "Long live Dimitrov!" "Long live the Bulgarians!" They were then taken by cars prepared by the authorities to the Luxe Hotel, where rooms had already been reserved. A Reuters reporter visited them at the hotel, and Dimitrov, with a cigar in his mouth, said as he smoked and talked that although he had not suffered physical torture in prison, the mental and nervous pressure was sometimes worse than physical torture. The three Bulgarians were extremely happy and anticipated that demonstrations of joy would take place across the country after the news of their arrival was released. Lenin's wife and Lenin's sister presented Dimitrov with large bouquets of flowers. (February 28th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rumors of Restoration Abound, Austrian Political Situation Unstable</h3>
<p>Archduke Otto's Activities in Belgium</p>
<p>France and Czechoslovakia Oppose Restoration of the Monarchy</p>
<p>Vienna: Over the past 36 hours, rumors have been rampant in Austria. Some say that a restoration of the monarchy is imminent, while others say that someone is plotting to assassinate Vice Chancellor Fey. The deadline for the ultimatum that the Austrian National Socialist Party supervisor Habicht issued to Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss in a previous radio address is due today, so the overall situation is particularly unstable, and fears of foreign interference are adding to the confusion caused by the rumors of restoration. It is reported that there have been secret messages exchanged recently between Vienna and a residence near Brussels (the residence of Archduke Otto, who claims to be the future monarch of Austria). A Reuters correspondent in Brussels has reported on this matter, saying that there has been unusual activity at the Archduke Otto's residence recently, but a formal statement issued by the residence stated that the Archduke does not wish to go to Austria.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, a key figure said that the French government is now doing its utmost to oppose the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. At the same time, political circles in Prague have denied the rumors that Czech troops are advancing towards the Austrian border, but have stated that the Czech government is now firmly opposed to the restoration of the monarchy in Austria.

<h3>Austrian Home Guard Expresses Determination to Cooperate with the Government</h3>
<p>Holds Determination to Maintain Austrian Independence</p>
<p>National Socialism Is Deeply Approved Of</p>
<p>But Unwilling to Have Internal Affairs Controlled by Others</p>
<p>Not Lightly Mentioning Restoration for Fear of Arousing Neighboring Countries' Displeasure</p>
<p>Vienna: Starhemberg strongly denied rumors of disagreements between the Home Guard and the Dollfuss government. It is claimed that we plan to implement our program in close cooperation with the Austrian Chancellor. We have no intention of using force or other plans that are disloyal to the country. We are now determined to cooperate with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss with complete loyalty. We have absolute faith in him. All rumors are being intentionally spread by someone. (February 28th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vienna: Starhemberg said today in response to questions from media representatives that the Home Guard advocates the immediate repeal of laws excluding members of the Habsburg monarchy from residing in Austria, but the question of restoration cannot be answered hastily at this time. That question is not purely an Austrian matter but also involves the future of neighboring countries, so Austria cannot rashly raise it. As for electing a regent, it is difficult to implement because there are no such provisions in Austrian law. The Home Guard is well aware that Austrian communist elements have sufficient weapons, so violent conflict may ultimately be unavoidable. However, now that obvious obstacles have been removed, the pressing task is to be loyal to the suffering people. Starhemberg also mentioned National Socialism, saying that the Home Guard strongly approves of German National Socialism and Pan-Germanism, but the best way to implement this ideology is to maintain Austrian independence. We welcome the restoration of friendly relations with Germany, but we are unwilling to have Austrian internal affairs controlled by National Socialism.

<h3>Ultimatum Requiring Cooperation with Germany Expires</h3>
<p>Authorities Prepare Everything to Cope with Events</p>
<p>Vienna: The Austrian National Socialist Party inspector Habicht previously announced to the Austrians by radio, urging them to cooperate with Germany, otherwise, one</p>
<p>A week later, he will resume his activities against the Austrian government. This statement is like an ultimatum, and the deadline expired this afternoon. Austria is quite worried because Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has firmly rejected his request for cooperation. There have not been any incidents yet, but the police have prepared everything.

<h3>8,000 Italian Troops Stationed on Austrian Border</h3>
<p>Vienna: It is now known that during the recent Austrian Socialist Party rebellion, 8,000 Italian troops were stationed in Padua, ready to rush to the Austrian border in an emergency. It is reported that although the authorities have not decided what necessary measures to take, the troops are fully prepared to deal with any incidents. (February 28th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Border Conflict Rumors Denied</h3>
<p>Rumors of incidents occurring on the Austro-German border have been denied by Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss to a Reuters reporter in Vienna, who stated that everything in Austria is peaceful and that they are now on guard to prevent incidents from occurring on the border. He also stated that the Austrian government has not sent troops to the Czech border but has only ordered several auxiliary troops to Upper Austria to maintain public order there. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Italy, Austria, and Hungary Form Economic Alliance</h3>
<p>With the Approval of France</p>
<p>Austrian Authorities Issue Announcement</p>
<p>Vienna: Rumors have spread that France will take action regarding the economic alliance agreed upon by Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and that Austrian troops and the Home Guard are being transferred to the Austro-German border to prevent unexpected incidents after February 28th. The Government Information Office has now issued an announcement denying these rumors. It is said that the discussions between Austria and Hungary did not involve the issue of a customs union but only sought to establish close economic cooperation between the three countries in accordance with the resolutions agreed upon at the Stresemann Conference in October 1932 and approved by France, and to conclude an agreement on the allocation of preferential tariffs. (February 28th, Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Austrian and Hungarian Prime Ministers to Meet in Rome</h3>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös are now scheduled to go to Rome around March 12th for three days to discuss plans for the economic resolution of the Danube countries with Italian Premier Mussolini. The plan stipulates that the three countries will mutually grant tariff concessions and open up a sea route for Austria and Hungary through Trieste and Fiume. This can be seen as proof that Italy is changing its attitude towards Germany. According to a Reuters dispatch from Rome, Italian political circles deny that Italy, Austria, and Hungary have a plan to form a formal political group along the lines of the Little Entente, which is formed by the three countries of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Italian political circles also firmly stated that the cooperation between Italy, Austria, and Hungary emphasizes economics, that the plan is not aimed at antagonizing any country, and that it can benefit Germany and the Little Entente countries. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to "Magyar Hirlap", former Hungarian Prime Minister Count Bethlen will go to Rome in the first week of March. It was originally scheduled for the Austrian and Hungarian prime ministers to meet with Italian Premier Mussolini in Rome in March. Bethlen's visit to Italy today is before the meeting of the three prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, but it is said that Bethlen's visit to Mussolini is of a private nature.

<h3>Tyrol Provincial Assembly Dissolved</h3>
<p>At the same time, the Tyrol province in western Austria has taken organized professional national action. The provincial assembly has dissolved itself and handed over its duties to the governor, who will add three representatives of the Home Guard to the provincial government and organize a so-called advisory committee of twelve representatives from the industrial, commercial, and religious sectors. The committee plans to serve temporarily until the local councils are reorganized according to the "Guild" system, which is what the Home Guard demands. (February 28th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Disbelieve Austrian Restoration</h3>
<p>(Paris) The diplomatic circles here are quite doubtful about the news of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family in Austria, considering it mere newspaper rumors and not credible. Therefore, they are unwilling to comment on it. However, they state that the restoration would not only cause political difficulties but also contradict the promises made by the Austrian and Hungarian governments to the great powers. On February 4, 1920, and April 1, 1921, the Conference of Ambassadors of various countries sent notes to the Austrian and Hungarian governments twice, stating that the restoration of the Habsburg royal family would be regarded as fundamentally contrary to the peace treaty. The allied countries would not only fail to recognize it but also be unable to tolerate it. At that time, Austria and Hungary replied acknowledging their compliance with the warnings from various countries. As for Hungary, after the failure of King Charles' restoration attempt, it also agreed not to attempt such a thing again, and its promise was even more formal. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Spy Agency Uncovered in Hungary</h3>

<p>Budapest A large-scale espionage case has recently been uncovered here, with the agency spread throughout the country. The police have not announced the number of people arrested in this case, but it must be quite a few. According to a government announcement, people from all walks of life were involved in the case. This spy agency specialized in gathering information about military strength and military training methods. According to private sources, this agency was established under the orders of a certain neighboring country. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>King of Bulgaria Arrives in Berlin</h3>

<p>(Berlin) The King of Bulgaria arrived in Berlin from Coburg this morning. It is reported that the King will only stay in the German capital for one day. In addition to visiting President Hindenburg, he will also offer a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

<h3>US Congress Refuses to Meet with Hunger Marchers</h3>
<p>Labor Party's Motion Ultimately Rejected</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons tonight rejected a motion to extend the session to draw the attention of Members of Parliament to the Prime Minister's refusal to meet with representatives of the unemployed. The motion was proposed by Buchanan, a left-wing leader of the Labor Party, and seconded by Labor opposition leader Samuel and others from the Independent Liberal Party. They were met with jeers when seconding the motion. The motion was ultimately rejected by 270 votes to 52. In response to questioning, Prime Minister MacDonald stated that previous governments and the Trades Union Congress had refused to meet with representatives of the unemployed. He believed that meeting with representatives of the unemployed, whether privately or in Parliament, would not benefit the unemployed. No government or prime minister would allow such politically motivated behavior. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>US Establishes New Bank to Develop Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Extends Huge Loan to Cuba</p>
<p>For the purpose of purchasing silver</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States will establish two specialized banks to develop trade relations with China and Soviet Russia. In addition to this, it is possible that banks will be established in South America and Europe. However, due to political relations, a special bank will be established to manage trade with Cuba, separate from the banks managing trade with other countries. The bank established for Cuban trade will have a capital of 11 million yuan, and its business will be to replace the China Consortium in making loans. According to those in charge, after this bank is established, it will lend several million yuan to the Cuban government. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is expected here that the US government will lend several million yuan to the Cuban government to purchase silver in the US. The exact amount is still unknown, but it is generally believed that this silver will be minted into Cuban currency. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) It is still unknown how much silver Cuba will purchase from the US, but well-informed sources say 20 million yuan. According to the New York Times, this plan could dispel the opposition of Cuban sugar producers to the Cuban sugar quota. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In addition to serving as the chairman of the newly established Export-Import Bank, Peek also serves as a foreign trade consultant, thus wielding almost dictatorial power in foreign trade. Peek stated last night that agriculture must restore its proper place in national life, which shows that the authorities intend to emphasize agriculture and de-emphasize industry. This matter involves many tariff revisions. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>US Launches Blue Eagle Movement, Plans Extensive Program</h3>
<p>To Revise and Organize Industrial and Commercial Regulations</p>
<p>To Stabilize Prices and Suppress Under-Selling</p>
<p>Johnson Convenes Meeting of Industrialists</p>
<p>So that they may freely express their criticisms</p>
<p>(Washington) General Johnson, Director of the Economic Recovery Administration, declared to a majority of industrialists today that an extensive plan has been formulated to revise and organize the various regulations of American industry and commerce. In addition, he plans to organize public meetings so that all interested parties can express their opinions. Before any criticism from various parties, Johnson explained in advance that he firmly believes that the economic recovery plan is making progress, and said that he has formulated an extensive plan to correct any imperfections in the recovery measures. The main points of his plan are roughly as follows: (1) Establish more uniform and fair rules to stabilize prices and use more effective methods of suppressing price drops below cost. (2) Unify wage rates and working hours for competing industries, and divide the country into several regions according to wage levels, so as to reduce working hours and increase wages. (3) Protect small businesses from the oppression of monopolies. (4) Establish new methods to make the various sectors more receptive to various regulations. (5) Stipulate the conditions for the allocation of funds for the Regulations Affairs Bureau (i.e., the Recovery Bureau) so as not to be influenced by oppression and other forces. (6) Delete conflicting provisions in various regulations to make them perfect. (7) Set up representatives of labor and consumers on the councils of the Regulations Affairs Bureau (i.e., the Recovery Bureau), with government representatives participating. (8) Solve various methods used in labor-capital conflicts and make good use of them. General Johnson concluded that organizing meetings to allow all parties to express their opinions is a sincere effort to remedy the shortcomings of the various regulations. In addition, Johnson also declared to more than 4,000 people that if necessary, various regulations can be amended by order of the President. After the amendments, if industrialists make requests, they can still be corrected. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Canada Ratifies Silver Agreement, New York Silver Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>(New York) The securities market today was relatively quiet. Although there was slight improvement in the bearish news during today's trading, it is generally expected that there will be no major changes in the short term, as there is still no concrete news about the Securities Market Control Act. Therefore, the best approach at present seems to be to remain neutral.</p>
<p>The silver market opened weaker today, then rebounded slightly, and finally was firmer. This was probably the result of Canada ratifying the London Silver Agreement.</p>
<p>The cotton market position is actually more stable than before. Some experts advise people to buy when prices fall. Buying interest was strong at the opening, and the market was firm, but later selling pressure was stronger.</p>
<p>Rubber prices tended to weaken today, as other markets in the US were generally uncertain, and there was no concrete news about the rubber restriction plan. Therefore, although overseas news was not bad, it could not revive the morale here. Several parties advise operators to continue to realize profits until there is definite news about the restriction measures. Wheat prices initially fell and then rose today. The reasons for the rebound were: first, the firmness of the Winnipeg wheat market; second, the over-selling of positions. Since this actual position is already more stable than before, there is a saying in the wheat market that it is quite safe to buy now. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Change of British Troops in Pingjin</h3>

<h3>Prelude to a Farce in Changchun</h3>
<p>｜Puyi is Preparing to Don Robes and Mount the Throne｜</p>
<p>(Changchun) The various preparations for Puyi's usurpation have been completed here. The officials of the "Manchukuo" executive government have completed various plans, and the court robes have also been made. The palace is setting up the objects to be used during the court session, so that they can be used after March 1st. According to the old customs of the late Qing Dynasty, the emperor was not easily seen when he ascended the throne. Therefore, only a small number of Japanese and "Manchu" people and Mongolians can participate in the usurpation ceremony. The newly built Temple of Heaven has four layers and three stone steps. The jade seal of the puppet emperor has already been made. The first ceremony will be held in the Temple of Heaven, and the second will be held in Puyi's palace. It has not yet been decided what kind of ceremonial dress Puyi will wear when he usurps the throne, but an upper general's ceremonial dress and a court dress embroidered with golden dragons have been made. Puyi will wear the uniform at the Temple of Heaven. There is now a new 1934 model car for Puyi's use, but it does not carry a crown, only a French monk's gauze cap embroidered with the "Manchukuo" flag and decorated with gemstones. This cap was custom-made in Japan. At present, the population of Changchun has suddenly increased. The people have no particularly enthusiastic expression, but it is feared that more people will come here before Thursday. Some Japanese have already arrived here, and Mongolians with strange costumes are often seen on the streets. Foreign reporters, film and sound film experts have come here to prepare to take news.

<p>(Nanjing) The representatives of Inner Mongolia met at 2:00 p.m. on the 28th to discuss the eight principles of the Inner Mongolia Autonomy Measures passed by the Central Political Council. They all agreed that they were in line with the actual situation and decided to accept them unanimously and report to each league and banner. President Wang is scheduled to summon the representatives for talks at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st. According to the representatives, the previous plan had some points that could be discussed, so they asked for a review in Beijing. Fortunately, Wang, Jiang, Dai, and other authorities made revisions and submitted them to the Central Political Council. This morning's passage is in line with the Inner Mongolian situation, and we have decided to accept it and are very grateful to the central government for its concern for Inner Mongolian autonomy. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian representatives considered that the eight principles for solving the Mongolian autonomy issue passed by the Central Political Council on the 28th were suitable for the Mongolian situation. Therefore, in the afternoon, they convened a meeting of representatives in Beijing and resident representatives to decide that the representatives should report to the princes of each league and banner and send a telegram to thank the central government for its good intentions. They will also issue a written telegram to the whole country in the name of the representatives in Beijing to express their acceptance. According to a certain representative, they plan to visit President Wang on the 1st to thank him for handling the Mongolian affairs. They also intend to state their opinions on the organization and location of the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee and the organization methods of the league and banner governments for reference. Although the central government has determined the principles on the issue of Mongolian banner taxation, the specific distribution method still needs to wait for them to report to the princes of each league and banner in Mongolia and the authorities of the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces to consult in detail, formulate opinions, and then send a telegram to the central government for review before a decision can be made.

<h3>Britain Expresses Determination Not to Recognize the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to responsible sources today, the US government will in no way recognize "Manchukuo" when Puyi usurps the throne tomorrow. According to those close to the government, the State Department has never even considered this. All kinds of rumors published in American and foreign newspapers are fictitious. A week ago, local newspapers published rumors that the US, upon hearing that Germany would recognize "Manchukuo" in order to promote German commerce, was now also considering this. Now that it has been denied by non-official but highly reliable sources, all rumors should be dispelled. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Telegram Again Claims Germany Will Recognize the Puppet State</h3>
<p>There is also a saying that Austria is preparing to recognize</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Consul General of Germany in Harbin, Barze, rushed to Tokyo to contact the German Ambassador to Japan, because Germany is going to be the first to recognize "Manchukuo," which will implement imperial rule on March 1st. As a result of the German Ambassador's understanding of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the negotiations between Germany and Manchuria proceeded smoothly. Therefore, Germany's formal recognition of "Manchukuo" is now rapidly progressing. After Germany, Austria is said to be preparing to recognize "Manchukuo." (Dentsu Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen to Inspect Northwest</h3>
<p>Departure in Three Weeks</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian also plans to go</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen met with reporters at Shenshi on the 28th and said that the development of the Northwest is extremely important, so he decided to go and inspect it in person. The departure is scheduled in about three weeks. He will take the Jinpu Railway and then the Longhai Railway. The director of the Xi'an Office, Liu Wenshan, and a group of 17 people have already set off and will arrive soon. In the future, he will also go to Lanzhou, Qinghai, and Ningxia, and then transfer to Sichuan. He is afraid that he will not be able to go to Xinjiang due to time constraints. The date of his return to Beijing will depend on the situation. The scope of the inspection will include the conditions of roads, water conservancy, bridges, agriculture, forestry, industry, commerce, animal husbandry, and social economy and culture. In addition to rectifying the Northwest health cause, the Central Committee also plans to establish a veterinary institute. President Dai has always paid close attention to the situation in the Northwest, and it is gratifying that he can go with him. As for the silver issue, it is handled by the Ministry of Finance, and no opinions have been expressed. Song Kaiyun agreed to a certain newspaper company's request to accompany him to the Northwest. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Presidents Wang and Dai visited Song Ziwen at noon on the 28th and discussed for a long time. Song will return to Shanghai within a few days to prepare his luggage and will accompany Dai to inspect the Northwest next month. According to a Central News Agency reporter, they will first go north to Xi'an, then to Lanzhou, cross the Han River from Lan, and then enter Sichuan by plane. The trip to Xinjiang was cancelled. The Northwest is our lifeline. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have caused the people to suffer extremely. We should actively develop it. A Northwest Office has now been established in Xi'an. I plan to personally promote the development of roads and water conservancy there. The important roads are: one is the section from Xi'an to Lanzhou, extending to Xinjiang, and the other is the section from Xi'an to Sichuan, which is also planned. The loans for cotton and wheat are calculated in gold coins. The increase in the price of silver has no impact. The rumor that there are losses is not accurate. However, the output of national cotton this year and the difficulty in selling cotton are being negotiated to reduce orders and modify contracts. I am the person involved in the White Silver Agreement, so it is inconvenient to express my opinion. I also did not attend today's Central Political Council meeting. I am also unable to express my opinion on the countermeasures for the US raising the price of silver because I am not in charge. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Yunnanese People's Stance on the British Troops' Occupation of Banhong</h3>
<p>The People's Diplomacy Support Association Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>Announcing the Process of the Banhong Boundary Demarcation Negotiations</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: After British troops invaded the Yunnan border from Burma a few days ago, the situation became extremely tense. Recently, the Yunnan People's Diplomacy Support Association issued a declaration on this case. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Our country is unfortunate, with disasters occurring one after another, internal strife following internal strife, and foreign insults increasing day by day. Since the 'September 18th Incident,' the Northeast has fallen, the national strength is insufficient, and the lost territories have not been recovered, which is heartbreaking. Our province borders strong neighbors, and the dangerous situation is no less than that of the Northeast. People with insight are all worried and angry. Therefore, they organized a national salvation association, raised national salvation funds, and strived to build border defenses to secure our territory and prevent covetousness. This is also the only way for the Yunnanese people to save the country. However, just as things were being planned, alarming news came. The British imperialists, disregarding justice and treaties, taking advantage of our country being preoccupied with many affairs and unable to attend to the border areas, repeated the old trick of forcibly occupying Pianma, sent troops to occupy our Banhong, and are forcing us into this situation. How can we sit idly by? For the sake of preserving territory and safeguarding national rights, the Yunnanese people must rise up in unison and vow to fight the imperialists to fulfill the patriotic duty of the people. Therefore, we have united various groups to form the Yunnan People's Diplomacy Support Association, pooling our wisdom and strength to serve as a backing for the government.</p>
<p>It is verified that Banhong is our territory and rich in various metal minerals, which the British have coveted for a long time. The reason why they have hesitated in the past is simply because the Hulu King's inclination towards us was strong and he could not be bribed. Recently, with their cunning revealed, they have not hesitated to blatantly rely on force to carry out aggression. (A brief outline of Banhong is attached below to clarify the truth.) Although Banhong is only a small corner of land, it is of great importance to our country's territorial sovereignty. The only way to deal with it is to earnestly request the government to lodge a strong protest, argue on the basis of reason, and demand that the British troops withdraw first, and stop all activities of British and Burmese people in the area, to avoid accidents and major disputes. The permanent fundamental solution is to earnestly request the government to demarcate the boundary with the British as soon as possible. If the boundary can be demarcated, all the outstanding issues of the Tuojiao issue, the Pianma issue, the Banhong issue, the Yichun issue, the Sichun issue, and the determined and undetermined boundaries can be resolved comprehensively. Otherwise, the British's insidious encroachment will be no less than the Japanese's violent annexation. Having obtained Tuojiao, they will then occupy Pianma; having obtained Pianma, they will then occupy Banhong. If they obtain Banhong, they will then occupy the western counties of Yunnan. In less than ten years, our Yunnan may become a continuation of the Northeast. Thinking of this, we cannot help but shudder. Therefore, the Yunnanese people should recognize that demarcating the boundary is the only way to resolve disputes and prevent aggression, and strive to achieve it. We also hope that the people of the whole country will rise up to help, and that the Yunnan Provincial Government and the Central Government will work together to negotiate earnestly, and will not stop until the goal of demarcating the boundary is achieved. This is the primary meaning of the purpose of this Association.</p>
<p>Although Banhong is our country's territory, it is far from the provincial capital and has long been regarded as a wilderness. Moreover, due to frequent troubles in recent years, we have not been able to pay attention to management. Therefore, the situation in the area is mostly vague, and we are often misled in negotiations. If we want to negotiate and demarcate with the British, it will be futile if we do not first conduct an investigation. Otherwise, if we do not know the enemy and ourselves, we will have no basis for negotiations, and even if justice is upheld and things are returned to their rightful owners, there may be no way to develop and construct it. Therefore, the Yunnanese people should quickly organize an inspection team to conduct on-site investigations, which can help diplomacy and lay the foundation for future construction, which is the best of both worlds. This is the secondary meaning of the purpose of this Association.</p>
<p>For these two meanings, we hope that the Yunnanese people will be down-to-earth, work hard, continue to work hard, persevere, not be intimidated by the British's power and harbor fear, not be motivated by temporary anger and overstep the bounds, not forget things after they are over and leave a bad name for five-minute enthusiasm, and not treat each other as strangers, lest we suffer the dissipation of a pile of loose sand. Then, our territory can be preserved, and our national rights can be asserted. Gu Tinglin said, 'The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual.' Mencius said, 'A country must first be attacked by itself before others attack it.' What to do is up to us to choose and encourage ourselves. This declaration is hereby made in the hope of public scrutiny."</p>
<p>Attached: Brief Outline of Banhong</p>
<p>(A) Location of Banhong: Banhong is under the jurisdiction of the Upper Hulu King, commonly known as the Savage Mountains, located in the southwest corner of this province, bordering Shuangjiang County to the east, Burma to the west, the Gengma and Mengding indigenous officials of Shunning and Zhenkang counties to the north, and the Menglian indigenous official under Lancang County to the south. The area is rich in various metal minerals, and gemstones and jade are found everywhere. The people are collectively referred to as "savages."</p>
<p>(B) History of the Banhong Boundary Demarcation: In the winter of the 25th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1899 AD), our side sent Liu Wansheng, the garrison of Tengyue, and Chen Can, the circuit intendant of western Yunnan, to demarcate the boundary together with the British official Skerd according to the original map agreed upon by Xue Fucheng, the envoy to Britain, and the British Foreign Office. At the meeting in Huban, it was agreed according to the yellow line on Xue's map that the areas belonging to Banhong would belong to us, and the areas belonging to Banguang would belong to Burma. During the demarcation, Skerd suddenly said that the longitude and latitude of Xue's map did not match the text of the treaty, and presented another small map, requesting that the boundary be determined according to the red line on the map. As a result, all the areas of Banhong and the lands of the indigenous officials of Mengjiao and Mengzhe were all designated as belonging to Burma. Liu Zhen and Chen Dao insisted that the British official had changed the line and encroached on the land, and agreed to each draw a line and request instructions from their respective governments. Subsequently, in the lines proposed for concession by both sides and the line reviewed and instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although the lands of the two indigenous officials of Mengjiao and Menglian were still designated as belonging to British Burma, the areas of Banhong remained completely belonging to us. This is a rough outline of the demarcation situation on that day.</p>
<p>(C) Current Situation of Banhong: It was recently reported that on December 14th of the twenty-second year, seven or eight British people suddenly arrived in Banhong, summoned the local people, and held a secret meeting. On the 19th, it was discovered that there were about 2,000 British soldiers, each carrying equipment and tools. Wherever they went, they immediately built roads for automobiles and repaired iron bridges on the Banhong River. It was also reported that Ma, a Hui Muslim from Bannong, was a descendant of those who fled from Yongchang after Du Wenxiu's defeat. He had considerable influence in the area and had been contacted and drugged by the British, willingly serving as a dog for the British. He secretly offered the map of the Banhong factory and used small favors to win over the Hulu King. The Hulu King refused, so the British used force to oppress and carry out aggression. This is a general overview of the recent situation in Banhong.</p>
<h3>The Western Route Army Encircles the Xiao and Gao Bandit Gangs</h3>
<p>He Jian Encourages the Soldiers</p>
<p>To Complete the Entire Mission</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the First Column of the Western Route Army broke through Xiao Ke's old nest, Yongxin, and the Second Column recaptured Kong Hechong's old nest, Xiaoyuan, the bandits lost all their support and fled in panic. Except for Kong Hechong, who is hiding in the deep mountains of Lianhua and Yongxin in western Jiangxi and has no ability to move for the time being, the two bandits Xiao Ke and Gao Yongsheng (Gao was the commander of the pseudo-16th Division under Kong Hechong) fled from Wanzai, Yifeng, Gaoan, Xiushui, and Wuning to the area between Ruichang and Wuning on the border of Hubei and Jiangxi, running hundreds of li in two weeks. Before they could catch their breath, Liu Yinggu, Commander of the Second Column of the Western Route Army, immediately led Peng Weiren's division of the First Column, Zhu Yaohua and Yue Sen's two divisions of the Second Column, and Zhong Guangren's brigade, together with Guo Rudong's division and Li Zongjian and Liu Peixu's two independent brigades of the Third Column, into long-pursuit teams and interception teams, using a large encirclement to strive to encircle and annihilate them. The deployment is as follows: (1) Liu Yinggu himself is stationed in Wuning, commanding the three divisions of Peng, Zhu, and Yue, and Zhong Guangren's brigade, to pursue closely, so that the bandits have no time to flee. (2) Guo Rudong and the two brigades of Liu and Li are assembled on the border of Ruichang, Wuning, and southern Hubei to intercept, so that the bandits cannot flee into southern Hubei. At the same time, Chairman Chiang was telegraphed to deploy the Northern Route Army to coordinate the interception in the De'an area. It seems that with the Yangtze River in front, pursuing troops behind, and heavy troops guarding dangerous passes on both sides, the bandit gang of more than 10,000 people is now trapped in a heavy encirclement, gathering in the Yangduan, Xiaoao, and Henggang areas between Ruichang and Wuning, becoming fish in a kettle. Liu Yinggu is currently actively deploying troops, pressing forward step by step, and expects to drive the bandits into a corner and launch a general attack from all sides to annihilate them. Therefore, there will be a fierce battle in the Yangduan and Henggang areas in the coming days. He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Army, anticipates that the two bandits Xiao and Gao will definitely be annihilated this time, and yesterday issued an order to encourage the commanders of the First, Second, and Third Columns, Liu Jianxu, Liu Yinggu, and Chen Jicheng, and the Jiangfang Commander Li Yunjie along the Gan River, as well as the army and division commanders of the Western Route Army, to make further efforts to complete the entire mission. The telegram provided very detailed instructions on the direction that the various units should strive for in the future. The original order stated, "It has been found that since our army has been pursuing and suppressing bandits in western Jiangxi and southern Hubei, it has achieved repeated successes, fought fiercely with the bandit gangs many times, and recovered many bandit areas. The old nests of Xiaoyuan, Meihua, and Yongxin have also been successively recovered. The bandits' base has been completely lost. Although their main force has not yet been annihilated, they have already become fish in a kettle and are expected to have difficulty surviving. Moreover, the two gangs of Xiao and Gao have become increasingly desperate after being repeatedly oppressed by our army and are having difficulty catching their breath. Although they are currently entrenched in the mountainous areas on the border of Ruichang and Wuning, attempting to survive, the combined forces of our army have been formed, and the units pursuing and suppressing them are all particularly diligent. It will not be difficult to capture them in one fell swoop. What the commander-in-chief hopes from the various units in the future is: (1) The Second and Third Columns should maintain close contact and strive to press the two bandits Xiao and Gao to the northeast in a large encirclement, coordinating with the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway troops to annihilate them in the Ruichang-Wuning border area or drive them into the Yangtze River to be submerged. (2) The First Column's troops in the eastern border of Lianhua and Chaling should quickly advance eastward and maintain contact with the Yongxin troops to eliminate the remaining bandits in the Yongxin-Lianhua-Mi (Gang) area. If necessary, the Anfu and Taianli troops should also advance southwestward as soon as possible to restore the normal state of the counties in southwestern Jiangxi. (3) The troops along the Gan River in western Jiangxi should strive to build more blockhouses and fortifications to create an iron wall on the west bank of the Gan River, so that the bandits in eastern Jiangxi have no possibility of fleeing west. This matter has been repeatedly ordered to be strictly complied with, but it has not been effectively done. Efforts must be intensified in the future, and the existing fortifications should not be considered sufficient. (4) Division Commander Tao (Guang) should comply with the new order and quickly complete the fortifications and blockhouses on both sides of the Yuan River, so that the bandits in southwestern Jiangxi and northeastern Jiangxi cannot communicate. (5) The troops currently stationed in southern Hubei should quickly eliminate the remaining bandits, and the troops repairing the riverbank should rush to construct continuous fortifications and strive to prevent the bandits in the areas to the north from crossing south. (6) The units clearing and suppressing Xiaoyuan and the western parts of Wanzai and Yifeng should make special efforts to clear and suppress and report as soon as possible that they have been cleared. The above are the duties of the commanders of the various units and are also a good opportunity to complete the entire mission of our army. It is hoped that everyone will understand this intention, muster the last of their courage, and achieve the glorious reputation of saving the country and the nation. There are high hopes for this."

<h3>A Male Floating Corpse Found in the Northern Suburbs of Songjiang</h3>
<p>A male corpse was suddenly found yesterday in Shiwutu, outside the North Gate of the city. The corpse was about thirty years old and wearing a dark blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers. The Shiwutu township police reported to the Procuratorate, which dispatched an official to the countryside today for an examination. The examination revealed no injuries to the body, and it appeared to be a suicide by drowning. A coroner's report was filled out and submitted, and the Procuratorate will issue a notice to claim the body. The township police have been instructed to provide a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>A Rural Woman Run Over and Killed by a Bus on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road in Suzhou</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, a long-distance bus on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road, the third direct Suzhou-Jiaxing bus departing from Suzhou, Suzhou No. 3, with Tang Qisheng as the driver and Guan A'gen as the co-driver, was driving near Bridge No. 46, about three kilometers away from Shengze, at 12:16 PM, when they suddenly saw a rural woman 400 meters ahead, slowly walking and blocking the road. They immediately honked the horn to warn her, but the woman was deaf and continued to walk slowly as before. In an instant, the bus was close to her, and the driver urgently steered to the left to avoid her, but because there was a small river on the left, it was impossible to avoid her. The woman was knocked down by the rear fender, and her head was crushed by the wheels and she died. After the incident occurred, Wang Bi, the director of the Shengze Public Security Bureau, and the supervising inspector of Wujiang County rushed to investigate the truth and reported it to the county government. Magistrate Wang went to the countryside yesterday (the 28th) to investigate. It is reported that the deceased was named Shen Bao, 48 years old, from Qizizhen. Her husband's name is Shen Baguan. Shen Bao was returning home from a relative's gathering that day and unexpectedly met with this disaster. The driver who caused the accident returned to Suzhou that day to report the details of the accident to the Suzhou General Bureau. It is said that the accident was not the driver's fault, but was caused by the deceased's deafness, her failure to avoid the bus, and her panic after seeing the bus, resulting in this tragic accident of a person being killed by a bus on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road for the first time since it opened.</p>
<h3>A Strange Tale of a Birth of Five Monkeys</h3>
<p>A woman named Pu, a villager in the Li family area, four li west of Chefang outside the Fengmen Gate, 39 years old this year, suddenly gave birth to five monkeys at 10:00 PM on the night before last (the 27th). Mother and children are still safe, and the neighbors all think it is a strange event. The number of people going to see them is overwhelming.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Wuxi Construction Bureau</h3>
<p>The Construction Bureau of this county was merged into the county government at the end of February last year, and a technical office was established separately to comprehensively manage construction matters. Zhang Dezai, a native of the county, was appointed as the technical director to handle all affairs. It has been more than a year since then. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considered local construction to be important, and it was decided through a provincial government meeting to restore the construction bureaus of six counties, including Wuxi. Director Zhang was still appointed to take charge of the Construction Bureau of this county. The county was informed and the letter of appointment and seal were issued. Preparations are now complete, and the bureau is still attached to the county government. It is scheduled to be formally established today. On the one hand, Director Zhang is re-compiling the budget and submitting it to the county for verification.</p>
<h3>Implementation of New Measuring Instruments in the Rice Industry</h3>
<p>Since receiving the order to promote weights and measures, the county government of this county has been actively carrying out the work. Weighing instruments have been replaced with the new system in accordance with the order, but measuring instruments have not been implemented. This is because it is difficult to implement the new system for measuring instruments used in the rice and bean industry. After the Rice and Bean Industry Association persuaded various rice shops and warehouses to adopt the new system, a meeting was held to discuss the intention of promotion and explain it in detail. It was agreed that starting from April 1st of this year, new instruments would be prepared. Once ready, the county government would be requested to send inspectors to the meeting for verification. It was decided that the new system would be uniformly adopted from May 1st to standardize the measurements.</p>
<h3>Active Development of Long-Distance Telephone by the Construction Department</h3>
<p>The development of long-distance telephone in Jiangsu Province is far behind that of Zhejiang Province. Only the following twelve counties have exchanges that are slightly formed and can communicate with each other: Nanjing, Lishui, Jurong (including the rural lines of Tianwang Temple and Chenwuzhuang), Zhenjiang (including the rural lines of Sibaitou, Gaozi, and Tanzhu), Danyang (including the rural lines of Lucheng and Erling), Jintan, Liyang, Wujin (including the rural lines of Banzha and Benniu), Yixing (including the rural lines of Shushan Dingshan, Xushe, and Zhangzhu), Jiangyin, Changshu, Wuxi, Wuxian, and Wujiang. In Wuxi, the following nine rural lines have been registered: Dangkou, Zhangjingqiao, Donghutang, Chenshu, Yangjian, Xueyanqiao, Yanjiaqiao, Hudai, and Zhaimen. At the same time, they can connect to the urban telephone for conversation. After the new machines are replaced, the connection will be more responsive, and words can be used to represent speech. Dedicated messengers from the exchange will deliver the messages back and forth, making it more convenient for users. Recently, Director Shen of the Construction Department believed that long-distance telephone only focused on the south of the Yangtze River, while the major cities in the north of the Yangtze River were still lacking. Expansion should be accelerated, poles and lines should be laid, and efforts should be made to proceed. He specially sent Technician Li Yangmeng to make practical plans and decided to connect Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Taixing, and Nantong from the Zhenjiang water line. It can be implemented in the shortest time, and it is expected that communication between the north and south of the Yangtze River will be possible after autumn.</p>
<h3>Changshu Water Police Sentenced to Imprisonment for Transporting Opium</h3>
<p>Pu Jinrong, a water police patrol officer stationed in Nantong, transported hundreds of pounds of opium through Baimao Port in this county earlier this month. He was discovered and intercepted by the local police team and sent to the county judicial office for investigation. In order to conclude the case as soon as possible, the county government sentenced Pu Jinrong to one year and six months in prison and fined him 2,500 yuan for the crime of selling opium on the 27th. Pu declared in court that he was dissatisfied and filed an appeal.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Election Fraud Case in the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The county Chamber of Commerce here held a re-election of executive and supervisory committee members in October last year. Among them, half of the old executive committee members should have been removed by drawing lots in accordance with the regulations. Unexpectedly, when Wu Zhongying, a member of the Party Department, was drawing lots, a member of the money industry discovered on the spot that the drawing of lots was fraudulent because there were differences in length and thickness. Therefore, it was immediately revealed and all ballot papers were sealed and sent to the county government. However, the issue of re-election was shelved. Now the business of the association is still maintained by the old members. Chairman Pang Jiegong has submitted the above situation to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for explanation and has received a reply that there is nothing inappropriate. Therefore, the elected committee members are of course valid, and it is scheduled to elect standing committee members and chairman on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Consolidation of the Public Security Bureau in Nantong County</h3>
<p>Due to insufficient funding and numerous malpractices, more than 20 public security sub-bureaus in Nantong County have been consolidated. It was decided at the county administrative meeting to abolish all public security sub-bureaus. The provincial department has approved the establishment of seven sub-bureaus and six branch offices in the entire county, which will be implemented on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Bribery Case of Private Sale of Drugs by a Pharmacy</h3>
<p>Taihe Pharmacy on Nandajie in the city secretly sold and manufactured red pill drugs. The apprentice leaked the information to the outside and urgently bribed the police officer with 400 yuan to settle the matter. County Chief Cheng ordered Fu Qianzhi, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to thoroughly investigate the matter due to public outcry.</p>
<h3>Opium Smugglers Intercepted in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Chen Rongtai, an opium smuggler from Luodian Lane, Yongsheng Street in the city, hired a small boat to privately transport nine large packages of opium (weighing about 500 to 600 taels) from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Patrol Chief Wang Changze led police officers to investigate separately. At 9 pm on the 27th, Yang Qilai and Yang Zuoshi, the boatmen transporting the opium, were arrested outside Bianyi Gate and five packages of opium (weighing 300 taels) were seized. They were taken to the general bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Landlords Shot by Bandits in Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Three bandits suddenly broke into the home of Dai Minglan, a farmer in Jizai Township in the second district of the county, and kicked open the back door. At that time, Dai was not asleep and woke up his family upon hearing the sound. They each held hoes, forks, and rakes to resist the bandits. Because the bandits were outnumbered, they planned to escape through the side door. Unexpectedly, Dai Minglan held a wooden stick and blocked their way. One of the bandits was extremely angry and shot Dai, hitting him in the waist. He fell to the ground and died immediately. The family has reported to the district office and transferred the report to the county government, requesting an order to strictly arrest them.</p>
<h3>One Person Burned to Death in a Fire</h3>
<p>Zhou Baoying's family, residents of Maben Town in the county, started a fire due to carelessness the night before. At that time, the wind helped the fire. Although the neighbors tried their best to put out the fire, it was ineffective. As a result, four houses were burned down. Zhou's young child was unable to be rescued due to the intense fire and was burned to death, which is also tragic.</p>
<h3>Jiasan Jizheng Rice Shop Closed Down</h3>
<p>Jizheng Rice Shop outside the West Gate has been open for more than 30 years. Its business is the best in the county. In recent years, it has suffered a lot of losses due to the impact of the rural economic bankruptcy. It suddenly closed down. Anjiu and other Qianzhhuang in the city owed the rice shop a debt of about 35,000 yuan. Representatives were immediately sent to file a lawsuit in the local court. Yesterday, the representatives of the Qianzhhuang were summoned by the court president, accompanied by Clerk Chen, and led the bailiffs to seal up and detain part of the shop's real estate, including 29 storefronts, the entire rice shop, rice factory, rice warehouse goods, and many other real estate properties, for auction and repayment.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Economic Survey of Guangxi Province (V) Qian Jiaju</h3>
<p>However, on the other hand, the development of highways is not without its negative effects. The first impact it has on the economic status of Guangxi Province is to aggravate the serious problem of Guangxi's foreign trade deficit. Once the highways are built, automobiles and gasoline have to be supplied from abroad. We only need to look at the report of the Guangxi Customs. The import of automobiles started in the ninth year of the Republic, with a value of only 8,918 customs taels. By the seventeenth year of the Republic, it suddenly jumped to 223,019 customs taels. 129,460 customs taels in the eighteenth year, and 25,702 customs taels in the twentieth year. The import of gasoline was only 153,393 gallons in the fifteenth year of the Republic, worth 54,218 customs taels. In the eighteenth year of the Republic, it suddenly increased to 449,412 gallons, worth 206,471 customs taels. In the twentieth year, it was 363,156 gallons, worth 233,713 customs taels. The huge increase in the import of automobiles and gasoline undoubtedly contributed to the increase in Guangxi's deficit. Second, the significance of highways in transportation is not comparable to that of railways or ships. The automobiles currently used in Guangxi have a load capacity of mostly less than 2.5 tons. In addition to facilitating travel, they are not only useless for transporting agricultural products, but also have little effect on transporting goods because the freight is too expensive and they cannot carry large quantities of goods. Therefore, except for a few items such as opium and foreign yarn that can be transported by highways, other goods cannot enjoy the benefits of highways. Third, it deepened the estrangement between the government and the people. There are three types of shares for the construction of highways in Guangxi. One is land shares, that is, wherever the highway passes, the people's land is confiscated according to its value as shares. However, the so-called "shares" are mostly not issued, and the land tax is still borne. The second is labor shares, that is, the conscription of people to build roads. In name, it is said to be paid 4 jiao a day, but in fact, only 1 or 2 jiao is often issued for food, and the remaining 2 jiao is used as labor shares. The third is road shares, that is, commercial shares. Although the name is free donation by merchants and civilians, it is actually a forced solicitation. From this, it can be seen that highways are completely built with the money and blood of the people. However, after the highways are built, farmers' ox carts and horse carts are not allowed to pass (because they are easy to damage the road surface). As a result, they have lost their inherent means of transportation. Farmers cannot afford to take cars. Most of the people who take cars are people with a little property or public officials. Whenever a car passes by, the dust rises high, and if they are slow to avoid it, they will be scolded immediately. Whenever we sit in the car and see the bitter faces of the farmers who dare to be angry but dare not speak, we always feel extremely sad. In addition, Guangxi also has a special phenomenon that is not seen in other provinces, that is, the extravagant life and arrogant atmosphere of the drivers. Their monthly income is more abundant than that of an ordinary county magistrate. The salary of a county magistrate in Guangxi is usually 140 yuan, but the income of an ordinary driver is at least 80 yuan, and many earn up to 200 yuan (the salary is only 40 or 50 yuan, but the extra income is extremely abundant). The special status of drivers is formed because the demand for drivers exceeds the supply after the large-scale highway construction, and because Guangxi has no training for this type of talent, it has to be recruited from Guangzhou. Scarcity makes it valuable. Once they arrive in the remote Guangxi, they will naturally act like the kings of Yelang and treat customers or ordinary people as emperors. We once talked to Chairman Huang about this situation. Chairman Huang said that they had heard about it for a long time and are now planning to set up a driver training school to recruit junior high school graduates for training. If they can do this, we believe it is the most effective way.</p>
<p>Although highways are not as important as railways in terms of economy, they have their own value in terms of transportation and military affairs. To remedy the shortcomings of highways in transportation, we believe that first, farmers should be allowed to use ox carts and horse carts. However, in order to avoid damaging the road surface, it may be stipulated that ox cart wheels should have a certain width or size, or that the wheels should be covered with rubber. In recent years, the price of rubber has plummeted. If the government purchases it in large quantities and resells it to farmers, we are confident that farmers can afford it. Second, the government can purchase more heavy-duty trucks. The load capacity of American trucks has reached 10 tons. This is naturally not possible on the current soft sandy road surface in Guangxi. However, if the road surface and bridges are slightly improved, using 4 or 5-ton trucks will not cause them to sink. The Construction Department may use the road maintenance fee income to purchase more of these trucks for the transportation of goods. The freight should also be fair and low to reduce the cost of goods. If these two measures are implemented, highways will not be "just for travel" as they are now.</p>

<h3>German Ambassador's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce Confirms No Recognition of the Puppet Manchukuo</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the German Ambassador, Dr. Trautmann, yesterday: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Your telegram has been read. Two days ago, a telegram released by a semi-official German news agency was published in Chinese newspapers. This telegram is sufficient to prove that the rumors you mentioned are false. You can make satisfactory publicity." Trautmann, January.</p>
<h3>Wang Delin, Kong Xianrong, and Others Telegraphically Condemn the Puppet Manchukuo's Usurpation of the Imperial Title</h3>
<p>Wang Zhigang, a member of the General Staff of the Northeast Volunteer Army, came to Shanghai from the front line in Jilin with a telegram from the army opposing the puppet country's usurpation of the imperial title. The following is an excerpt: "To all national institutions, public organizations, and overseas and domestic elders and brothers, We understand that since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese bandits have forcibly occupied Shenyang, then Liaoning Province, and then annexed Heilongjiang and Rehe Provinces. At the same time, they have been holding the puppet Puyi and organizing the so-called Puppet Manchukuo. Recently, they have committed an even more rebellious act, violating the will of the people, and intend to usurp the imperial title on March 1st to consolidate their rebellious foundation. The bad news has spread and the whole country is shocked. The four northeastern provinces are lands within the entire territory of the Republic of China. Now the Japanese and puppet regimes ignore public opinion and arbitrarily destroy them. Anyone with a conscience can tolerate this? For two years, our army has fought bloody battles in eastern Jilin, avoiding dangers and fearing sacrifices. We will never recognize this absurdity. We swear to lead 100,000 soldiers and fight against the enemy and rebels between the Changbai Mountains and the Heilongjiang River. If the Northeast is not recovered in one day, this will will not be relaxed in one day. I dare to tell the world about our sincere intentions. I hope that the people of the country will be aware of the pain of lips and teeth being cold, make plans for a rainy day, and rise up together to provide assistance. I would be deeply grateful. Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army, Kong Xianrong, Commander-in-Chief, Wu Yicheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Front, and all commanders and soldiers."</p>
<h3>Temporary Martial Law Today</h3>
<p>Wen Hongen, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a phone call from the municipal government yesterday afternoon ordering the implementation of temporary martial law from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on March 1 (today). After receiving the order, Director Wen immediately ordered all districts to comply.</p>
<h3>Interview with Chu Minyi</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chu Minyi, secretary of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by night express train from Nanjing at 7:30 a.m. yesterday. Chen Shaokuan, the Minister of the Navy, and Gan Naiguang, the vice-minister, arrived in Shanghai with Chu. After getting off the train, Chu returned to his residence on Avenue Albert and then went to the Sino-French School to handle school affairs. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the school and asked about the progress of the Xinjiang Construction Planning Committee. The following is a record of his interview:</p>
<h3>Developing New Provinces</h3>
<p>The central government has already begun to develop the Northwest region. It is well known that the Northwest provinces have vast land and sparse population, and are rich in minerals. Therefore, developing the Northwest is the only way out for our country. Xinjiang is located in the west, with vast land and abundant resources, which is the best among all provinces. People who care about national affairs have successively gone to the area to conduct inspections, and they all believe that the development of Xinjiang is urgent. Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan was aware of this and ordered me to prepare for the Xinjiang Construction Planning Committee. After being appointed, I sent letters to various departments to select and appoint those familiar with the situation in the province to serve as members of the committee. Twenty-five people, including Li Jingcong and Tang Kesan, have been appointed as members. Li Tang and others know more about the situation in Xinjiang, so they should be able to express their opinions on the planning of Xinjiang's construction. It has now been decided to hold the first meeting in Nanjing within the next week. After that, meetings will be held every week or every two weeks, and the contributions will be presented to the competent authorities for implementation as much as possible. The committee is under the Executive Yuan. The meetings are convened by me, and the issues discussed are limited to construction, such as developing new provincial transportation, developing mineral resources, and implementing education. Political issues will also be studied. There are no formal reports on the war in the province. The central government has not yet received reliable reports on the situation in Kashi, southern Xinjiang, due to inconvenient transportation and difficult communication. The news published in various newspapers is all foreign telegrams, and there is bound to be considerable manipulation among them. Therefore, the construction of transportation in the new province is the only important task, and it cannot be delayed for even a moment.</p>
<h3>Panchen's Southern Tour</h3>
<p>Chu continued, "In addition to handling school affairs and attending the board of directors of the Sino-French Pharmacy, I came to Shanghai this time to contact Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, and others about welcoming the Panchen Lama to Shanghai. Vice-Chairman Zhao Pilian of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and others hosted a banquet for the Panchen Lama in Nanjing last night, and I was also present. During the banquet, the Panchen Lama mentioned the famous scenic spots in the south of the Yangtze River and expressed his intention to visit them. The Panchen Lama left Tibet for the south in the first year of the Republic of China and has been to Nanjing three times. However, he only visited Hangzhou and other places once in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. He decided to leave Nanjing for Shanghai around March 20 and stay for a short time before going to Hangzhou for a temporary residence. He also plans to lecture several times in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. After the weather warms up, he will go to Qinghai and other places. As for the date when the central government specially sends Ambassador Huang Musong to Tibet, there is no definite date yet."</p>
<h3>Silver Issue</h3>
<p>Chu also said, "The silver price issue will be submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion this morning, and there will be a concrete decision. Raising the price of silver will be detrimental to our country. The central government is paying close attention to this and will organize a special committee to conduct a serious study. The issue of currency reorganization will also be studied in detail. As for the cases decided by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, they have been sorted out and implemented separately. The case of reforming the provincial system is also in progress. The rumors that the central government will order Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces to conduct trials first are not true."</p>
<h3>Shandong Political Visiting Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi Groups Leave Shanghai for Guangzhou on the 3rd</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Groups Leave Nanjing for Hangzhou the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>| Four Others Are Sent to Europe to Study Education |</p>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Government organized a political visiting group, which departed from Jinan the day before yesterday and arrived in Nanjing. The Guangdong and Guangxi groups of the delegation left Nanjing for Shanghai yesterday morning and are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Guangdong on the 3rd. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang groups are scheduled to leave Nanjing on the 3rd to visit the cities along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway and then go to Hangzhou and other places after arriving in Shanghai. In addition, four others are sent to Europe to inspect education, scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship on the 14th.</p>
<h3>China and Foreign Countries Attach Importance to Raising Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Telegraphed the Consul General in Shanghai to Investigate and Reply</p>
<p>Foreign Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Roosevelt Advocating Caution</p>
<p>International Trade Bureau Said It Was Detrimental to Us</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Banking Association telegraphed US President Roosevelt to protest the policy of raising silver prices, as the telegram was not delivered through diplomatic channels, Roosevelt did not reply. However, according to reliable sources, Roosevelt has indeed attached great importance to this and telegraphed the US commercial agencies to investigate. At the same time, the local foreign chambers of commerce also telegraphed Roosevelt, asking him to handle it with caution. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Consuls Sent Orders to Investigate</h3>
<p>After receiving the protest telegram from the Shanghai Banking Association stating that raising silver prices would be detrimental to our country, Roosevelt telegraphed Arnold C. Kuhlman, the US Commercial Counselor at No. 3 Guangdong Road, and Consul General Clarence E. Gauss yesterday to investigate our country's financial situation, price index, and commercial realities, and whether there would be any harm to China after the silver price raising policy is implemented in the future. After receiving the telegram, the Consul General and the Commercial Counselor formulated forms and ordered experts to conduct detailed investigations to the relevant agencies and Chinese and foreign banks. Arnold and Clarence are very familiar with the situation in China and are regarded by Americans as "China hands." Roosevelt attaches great importance to their reports. It is estimated that the US standard and steps for raising silver prices must wait until the reports of the two arrive in the US and are studied before they can be decided.</p>
<h3>Foreign Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Roosevelt Advocating Caution</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Shanghai Foreign Chamber of Commerce held a general affairs committee meeting on Friday last week and resolved to telegraph President Roosevelt, asking him to carefully consider the impact of the silver system legislation proposed by the US Congress on China. The telegram was sent out last night (27th) and read: "The Shanghai Foreign Chamber of Commerce, which has representatives from 12 countries, respectfully requests Your Excellency to consider the impact of any silver system legislation on China. We believe that this legislation should be limited to the price of silver in the United States and should not involve the world price of silver. What is necessary for China's prosperity is that the price of silver must increase in accordance with the increase in general prices. China has been able to avoid the major impact of the world economic crisis due to the low price of silver, while other countries have used high-priced round currency units, resulting in harmful results, and have reduced the value of the currency as a remedy. Imports to China must be paid for by its exports or loans to China, otherwise Chinese silver will flow out continuously. The increase in the price of silver will cause land prices and commodity prices to plummet, and it will be necessary to prohibit the export of silver or impose an export tax on silver. Then China will be on a managed round currency basis. "This telegram was sent out last night, so no reply has been received yet.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Said He Would Listen to the Government</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Nanjing, the news that the Central Political Council has approved the silver agreement has been passed. A reporter from Shin Shi News visited Lin Kanghou, the secretary-general of the Banking Association, and asked for his opinion on the approval of the agreement. According to Lin, the Banking Association had previously telegraphed the central government, requesting a temporary delay in approving the silver agreement. This is the opinion of the banking industry colleagues. However, whether to adopt it or not is up to the government's own decision. The banking industry has no opinion to express. However, since the government has approved the agreement, it will inevitably have appropriate countermeasures when the US raises silver prices in the future. We can only wait and see the development of the US policy and re-determine the response policy at any time.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Silver Exports Increased Significantly</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, our country is a silver-using country. Silver is the lifeblood of our country. US President Roosevelt is implementing a monetary policy to lower the price of the US dollar and raise the price of silver. This policy has a gradual outflow crisis for our country's silver. In recent years, our country's rural areas have gone bankrupt, prices have fallen, foreign goods have flooded the market, and the trade deficit has increased year by year. Silver outflows are countless. According to customs reports, the value of silver exported from our country in the 21st year of the Republic of China was 57,645,491 yuan in national currency. By last year, it had increased to 94,288,936 yuan, of which exports to the United States accounted for more than 70% of the total. If the US policy is implemented this time, it will be even more unfavorable to the people's livelihood and economy, and the trade deficit and silver exports will be even more considerable. The following is a statistic of silver exports from our country to various countries in the past two years:</p>
<p>Country Name 21st Year of the Republic of China 22nd Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>British India Burma 8,872,569 9,348</p>
<p>Annam 1,246 196,020</p>
<p>Hong Kong 12,233,728 18,241,402</p>
<p>United Kingdom 213,542 215,115</p>
<p>Japan 53,845 113,908</p>
<p>Dutch East India 115,268 46,385</p>
<p>Philippine Islands 14,122</p>
<p>Singapore, etc. 517,511 1,662,834</p>
<p>United States 968,574 70,958,492</p>
<p>Kwantung Leased Territory 2,799,000</p>
<p>Other Countries 34,767,491 22,310</p>
<p>57,645,774 94,288,936</p>
<h3>HSBC Bank Annual Meeting Discussion</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao (North-China Daily News) reported that at the HSBC Bank's annual shareholders meeting held in Hong Kong last Saturday and Sunday, Chairman Peel mentioned the silver issue in his speech. He stated that three years ago, the chairman at the time mentioned the status of silver and hoped that all relevant governments would cease any plans that would worsen its status. We still hold this view, believing that government intervention aimed at artificially raising silver prices in China could only be harmful. For this reason, we do not approve of the silver agreement reached at the London World Economic Conference. This sets a precedent for attempting to manage the supply of silver. Although the amount involved is relatively small, its impact on silver prices is also very subtle. It seems that this will continue to be the case in the future. However, the establishment of an international agreement that regulates artificial markets and restricts the free operation of supply and demand is enough to encourage silver speculators. The decline in currency values worldwide has caused silver prices to rise relative to various currencies. At the same time, the prices of Chinese export goods have also risen accordingly. China is gradually needing to export silver to pay for its import goods, which is an ominous sign. We can better understand the situation by briefly looking at the following figures: In the seven years leading up to the end of 1930, India and China together consumed an average of approximately 66% of the world's silver supply, which is approximately 200 million ounces per year. In 1931, consumption fell to 116 million ounces, and in 1932, it fell to 52 million ounces. In 1933, India consumed approximately 10 million ounces, while China's silver exports exceeded imports by 15 million ounces. From this, it can be seen that those who previously consumed two-thirds of the world's silver supply have now left the silver market. Although the world's silver production has fallen from an average of approximately 240 million ounces per year to 163 million ounces, the total supply last year was still as high as 273 million ounces. This is not much less than the average supply in the past seven years. Therefore, there are now more than 150 million ounces of silver that no one is concerned about, and they are mostly in the hands of speculators. I believe that you are well aware that the current unstable state is caused by the possibility of the sudden adoption of government plans, which can completely change the situation overnight and put merchants in a very difficult position, and greatly increase the burden on bankers engaged in foreign exchange business, and so on.</p>
<h3>Public Commemoration of Wu Tiyun Scheduled</h3>
<p>To be Held on April 1st</p>
<p>Resolution by the Sponsors Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Central Committee member Wu Chaoshu passed away in Hong Kong, Wu's relatives and friends, as well as people from across the country and friendly nations, were all saddened. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and former Minister of Railways Ye Gongchuo, who had a deep friendship with Commissioner Wu during his lifetime, initiated the holding of a memorial meeting for Commissioner Wu and solicited sponsors from all walks of life. It is now reported that the number of people who have agreed to participate as sponsors has reached several hundred. The sponsors' meeting was held at 2:00 PM yesterday in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge to discuss the arrangements for the memorial meeting and to appoint a preparatory committee to immediately begin preparations.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The sponsors who attended yesterday, representing groups, included Huang Zaoxiong representing the Municipal Education Association, Yu Zhenhui representing the Municipal Agricultural Association, Lu Danlin representing the Road Association, Tao Leqin representing the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, Zhang Yichen and Hu Fengxiang representing the First Special District Citizens' Association, Xu Xingchu representing the Chinese International Society, Jiang Yiping representing the Lawyers Association, and Huang Renzhi representing the Shanghai Local Association. Representatives from government agencies included Yu Ming representing Executive Yuan President Wang, Fu Bingchang representing Legislative Yuan President Sun, Ding Shuhua representing the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, Fan Shouzhi representing the Two Roads Administration, Li Dachao representing the Shanghai Municipal Government, Lin Meiyan representing the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang Mengjie representing the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Yu Ming, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, Wang Qikun representing the Shanghai Municipal Commodity Inspection Bureau, Zhou Hanmei representing the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, Gao Yang, President of Jiangsu Educational College, as well as Xue Dubi, Li Liejun (represented by Li Mi), Cai Yuanpei, Ma Qijun, Wang Zhengting, Chen Ce, Wang Qi (represented by Zhou Nianhang), Zhang Huichang, Liu Haisu Wang Jingqi, Ye Gongchuo, Luo Panhui, Lin Gengbai, and over a hundred others.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, all the sponsors stood up to observe a three-minute silence for Commissioner Wu. Then, Chairman Ye Gongchuo reported, stating that Commissioner Wu's learning and knowledge had always been admired by his colleagues, and his handling of foreign affairs was particularly praised in diplomatic circles. He had contributed greatly to the party and the country. Unfortunately, he suddenly fell ill and passed away in Hong Kong. This is a loss for China. Everyone was shocked and saddened by this sad news. It is the intention of the colleagues that there is a need for a centralized expression regarding the passing of Commissioner Wu, as it can show mourning and make an impression on society. Therefore, I and President Sun Zhesheng initiated the holding of a memorial meeting and notified all parties to solicit opinions. Now, over thirty central government departments and provincial governments, as well as over ten local party headquarters, forty-odd groups, and over four hundred and fifty individuals have joined. Commissioner Wu will be buried on March 13th, and large-scale memorial services will be held in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Mrs. Wu will come to Shanghai from the north immediately after Commissioner Wu's burial, and the memorial meeting will be held at that time. However, the holding of the memorial meeting is only of a temporary nature. We should formulate permanent memorial measures, one being to establish a scholarship fund, and the other being to establish a school. These two matters are already complicated, so we will determine them after Mrs. Wu comes to Shanghai and we solicit her opinions. Now, we will ask you to discuss the methods for holding the memorial meeting.</p>
<h3>Resolution Methods</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the discussion began, and the following was resolved: (1) Memorial meeting proposal: It was decided that the meeting would be held at 2:00 PM on April 1st at the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. (2) Publication of a commemorative album: It was decided that the preparatory committee would compile and print it. The order of compilation would be: 1. Commendation certificate from the National Government; 2. Portrait of Commissioner Wu; 3. Calligraphy of Commissioner Wu; 4. Biography of Commissioner Wu. (3) Establishment of the Tiyun Scholarship and preparation for the Tiyun Memorial School: Deferred for discussion. (4) Funding for the memorial meeting: It was decided that the Zhongshan Culture and Education Center would temporarily provide funds, and the sponsors would share the costs in the future.

<h3>Charity Federation Requests Reduction of Land Value Tax for Charity Organizations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation recently investigated the Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of land value tax, which was first implemented in the areas of South Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong. The Federation believes that most of its funds come from land income. Once the land value tax is implemented, the source of funds for charity organizations will inevitably be reduced, which will greatly affect the future of charitable undertakings. Yesterday, it submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Finance Bureau, along with two copies of the property list, requesting that, in addition to the exemptions permitted by regulations, the remaining tax be reduced by half.</p>

<h3>French Female Aviator Hirth Did Not Arrive in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Departed from Hong Kong Yesterday Morning with Bad Weather Along the Way</p>
<p>French Consulate Immediately Sent Telegrams to Various Places for Inquiry Yesterday</p>
<p>Learned Last Night That She Encountered Fog and Returned to Shantou to Land</p>
<p>French female aviator Hirth, who is making her second transcontinental flight between Paris and Tokyo in an airplane manufactured by the Hispano-Suiza factory, encountered setbacks along the way, but her ambition has not diminished. She flew from Hanoi to Hong Kong the day before yesterday and departed from Hong Kong yesterday morning to come to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive here at 1:00 PM yesterday. However, as of last night, there was no news. All parties were quite concerned about the safety of the lady.</p>
<p>Now that the news has been confirmed that she landed in Shantou due to fog, people are relieved. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Airplane Model</h3>
<p>The airplane that Ms. Hirth is flying this time is larger than the one she flew to China last time. The airplane is a Breguet land-based aircraft No. 330 produced by the Hispano-Suiza aircraft factory (translated as the Swiss Company), with a 650-horsepower engine. It flies quite fast, estimated to travel 230 kilometers per hour. The airplane's designation is (Fakfm). It only takes six hours to travel from Hong Kong to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Long Wait Without Arrival</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local French Consulate received news that Ms. Hirth had departed from Hong Kong with her assistant Brax at 7:15 AM yesterday morning to come to Shanghai. The journey is 700 miles and it was estimated that she would arrive here around 1:00 PM. Therefore, representatives from all relevant parties, such as Security Chief Yang Hu, Special Section Chief Wang Chengzhi, led a small platoon of motorcycle machine gun security team to protect the airfield. In addition, those who came to welcome her included Aviation Association Secretary-General Lin Wojiang, French Consul-General Melia, Consul Gu A'fa, French Concession Police Chief Faber, French Association representative Wu Dingnai, US Air Force Captain Fulu, as well as French Concession Political Department Director Shandoyang, and many Chinese and French gentlemen and ladies, all went to Hongqiao Airport to welcome her. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau Passport Inspection Office also sent Yao Changzhen and Zhang Feifan to the airport to prepare to inspect entry passports and whether there were any contraband goods, etc. However, the welcomers waited until 4:40 PM and still did not see the airplane arrive in Shanghai. They called the French Consulate and other relevant parties to inquire, but did not receive any reports about Ms. Hirth. Therefore, the welcomers became impatient and returned to their residences to rest one after another.</p>
<h3>Poor Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to reports received from Hongqiao Airport, the weather in various ports in South China between Hangzhou and Hong Kong was quite bad. Based on this situation, it can be inferred that Ms. Hirth did not arrive in Shanghai after departing from Hong Kong yesterday morning, undoubtedly because she was blocked by bad weather. However, there was no news as to where she landed in the middle of the journey.</p>
<h3>No News</h3>
<p>Last night, various Chinese and foreign circles telegraphed the French Consulate to inquire about news. The French Consulate also telegraphed Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places to inquire, but there was no trace of the airplane. There was no news. It is said that the airplane Ms. Hirth was traveling in did not have a radio, so all parties were extremely concerned about the lady's safety.</p>
<h3>Returned to Shantou</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Shantou, 28th Dispatch: Famous French female aviator, Ms. Hirth, flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Because she encountered fog in the middle of the journey and could not identify the route, she was forced to return 100 kilometers north of Xiamen. After noon, she landed in Shantou. Once the weather improves, she still intends to fly to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Convened Tea Merchants Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Crackdown on Toxic Colored Tea Leaves</p>
<p>Use of Non-Toxic Colorants</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry's Commodity Inspection Bureau received the French government's ban on the import of colored toxic tea in 1932, considering that this matter concerned a large export of the country's agricultural products, if implemented, it would greatly impact international trade. Therefore, Chief Technician Zhou of the Bureau has been engaged in researching non-toxic colorants and has now invented them. After trial production and testing, they were very satisfied. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, they convened a conversation with Chinese and foreign tea merchants and requested tea merchants to use this non-toxic colorant and announced five measures. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Those who attended yesterday, in addition to Commodity Inspection Bureau Director Cai Wuji and Tea Inspection Section Chemical Experiment Group Technician Zhou Zhenjun, included Yu Jinming of the Shanghai Tea Industry Association, Tao Zhensheng of the Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association, Tang Zhenxian, Tang Bingchen, and Dong Lai of China Tea Company, Yu Qintai of Yili Tea Company, Zhu Bogen of Yongxiang Tea Company, Hong Xinyuan and Hong Binxing of Wanyuan Tea Company, Piao Qiaosheng of Xiehe Foreign Company (Nicholson P.), Qiaopo (C.L. Chopdn) of Tongfu Foreign Company, Tang Bingxi of Yingfaxing, Wang Chunrong of Wanchengyu, Zheng Jianyuan of Yuanfengrun Tea Company, and Shan Huapu of Yongxinglong Tea Company, totaling over thirty representatives.</p>
<h3>Trial Process</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Director Cai Wuji gave a speech, the general idea being: The significance and implementation methods of the Bureau convening Chinese and foreign tea merchants today to discuss the implementation of changing to non-toxic yellow colorants. (1) The Bureau has been engaged in prohibiting the export of toxic colorant tea leaves since receiving an order from the Ministry of Industry last year. This matter is extremely important to the foreign trade of green tea in our country. The urgent need to prohibit such toxic colorants is one of the important missions of the Bureau's inspection policy, and it will be implemented before other countries make any expressions. (2) However, regarding the measures received by the Bureau last year, it was quite difficult to implement them in terms of timing and substitutes. Later, at the request of Chinese and foreign tea merchants, the Bureau requested the Ministry of Industry to allow a one-year grace period, and to implement them after the new tea was on the market this year. The Ministry of Industry approved this and notified all Chinese and foreign tea merchants last year. (3) In order to implement the Ministry's order and solve the difficulties of tea merchants, the Bureau specially spent a long period of time last year, with the Chemical Experiment Department designating Chief Technician Zhou to engage in the trial production of non-toxic yellow pigments. Fortunately, it has been completed in a very short time. Chief Technician Zhou has drafted a separate report on the advantages and disadvantages of toxic and non-toxic yellow pigments and the process of their creation, which can be consulted by everyone present. (4) The cost of the newly invented colorant is three-tenths stronger than the old toxic colorant. The two together are two-thirds stronger. The estimated cost of non-toxic tea colorant from numbers one to five is about twice as high per pound, while the difference between numbers six to eight is negligible. If there is a large amount of manufacturing and common management, the price will be lower. (5) There are two important issues for discussion today: (A) How to manufacture and sell the non-toxic pigments invented by the Bureau; (B) How to implement and supervise tea merchants in all localities to uniformly change to the new pigments, and notify the Shanghai Tea Merchant Association and the Foreign Tea Industry Association. Last year, the Bureau also sent personnel to various counties in Anhui Province and Shaoxing and Wenzhou to promote the pigments. However, it is deeply feared that a small number of tea merchants will outwardly agree but inwardly disobey, so tea merchants must jointly implement the measure. If there is a surplus from the sale of non-toxic colorants by the Bureau, it will be used for public research and public undertakings in the tea industry.</p>
<h3>Crackdown Measures</h3>
<p>The Bureau also notified Chinese and foreign tea companies and tea houses of five measures for using non-toxic colorants and inspection: (1) Registering tea factories: In order for the Bureau to facilitate guidance and supervision, the Shanghai local tea companies will be registered first. The registration period is approximately before February and March of this year. (2) Specifying colorants: Article 12 of the regulations promulgated by France on July 7, 1932, regarding the import of colored tea into French territories, states that "Green tea that is mixed with various teas and colored with indigo, turmeric, talc, or gypsum is not prohibited." Indigo is commonly used by merchants, so there is not much problem with blue. The use of turmeric has a slightly astringent taste, which is actually obstructive. The Bureau has been engaged in research, and substitutes for light yellow and deep yellow have been completed. Substitutes for deep yellow such as Three Fish have also been trial-produced and will soon be distributed to various tea companies for trial use. There will also be results. Therefore, regarding coloring colorants, those with existing products available will be designated. Those without equivalent products available will be made by the Bureau, and the colorants will be announced. (3) Issuing a notice to submit tea samples: When tea houses and local tea companies transport or produce each type of tea leaf and distribute tea samples to various foreign companies, they must also submit a copy to the Bureau for preliminary inspection. Once a prohibited coloring is discovered, the Bureau will notify the tea houses and foreign companies to prohibit sales, as a precautionary measure to avoid unexpected disturbances. This measure will be implemented when the new tea is on the market this year. (4) Registering the capacity of colored tea this year: The old tea that has not been sold before the new tea is on the market next year is customarily blended and sold in the new tea, which is bound to mix the spurious with the genuine, making it extremely difficult to crack down. It is planned to order Chinese and foreign tea merchants to register the existing green tea with the Bureau within a certain period this year. At the same time, personnel will be dispatched to thoroughly investigate and prevent concealment. Those who are found to have toxic colorants when the registered green tea is sold out will be strictly cracked down in accordance with the regulations. (5) Requesting the Ministry to notify tea-producing provinces and tea merchants manufacturing green tea to pay attention to colorants: Now that the Bureau's colorants have been decided, a request has been submitted to notify all green tea manufacturers to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Leading Inspection</h3>
<p>In order for Chinese and foreign tea merchants to understand the newly created non-toxic yellow colorant, the Bureau specially used water to brew toxic colorant tea leaves and non-toxic colorant tea leaves separately in tea bowls to observe the color depth and tea quality and taste. As a result, all tea merchants were satisfied. After the inspection, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>New Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, Peng Hu, Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Zhu Yaoting, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, was transferred to the position of Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, the Ministry of Communications appointed Peng Hu, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to replace him. Director Zhu instructed Secretary Zou Hongbin to be responsible for handling the handover, and he has already gone to his new position. The newly appointed Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, Peng Hu, also took office at the Bureau yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Arrived at the Bureau to Take Over</h3>
<p>After Peng was appointed as the Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, he resigned from his position as Deputy Director of the General Affairs Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to General Manager Liu Hongsheng, and went to the Maritime Administration Bureau to take over with Chou Lunjie, He Daoyun, and others at 9:00 AM yesterday. After Peng arrived at the Bureau, he met with the original important staff members, inquired briefly, and expressed that he still intended to rely on them. As for the handover, former Director Zhu Yaoting had instructed his subordinates to rush to complete it when he was appointed to the new position, so Director Peng had already completed the handover when he took office yesterday.</p>
<h3>Appointed Staff</h3>
<p>After Peng arrived at the Bureau, the former secretary and the chiefs of the first and second sections had resigned and gone to Zhejiang with Director Zhu to take on their new positions. Therefore, Chen Baoyan was appointed as secretary, Chou Lunjie as chief of the first section, and He Daoyun as chief of the second section.</p>
<h3>Expressed Opinions</h3>
<p>According to Peng, he will not make changes to the internal staff in order to maintain skilled personnel, but will strive to increase efficiency in handling affairs. He also said that he is not good at publicity and will devote his efforts to planning and engaging in practical work. Peng expressed that there were not many achievements in the shipping industry in the past, so it is necessary to urgently seek to save our declining shipping industry. Peng's courtesy name is Shinian, and he is from Liuyang, Hunan. He has a Master of Arts in Political Science from Stanford University in the United States and has served as Secretary of the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Central Training Department, and Deputy Director of the General Affairs Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Visited Chen Jiliang</h3>
<p>Chen Jiliang Can Be Discharged from the Hospital in Three to Five Days</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan left Beijing by night train at 11:00 PM the night before last and arrived at the North Station at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road to visit Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet, and left after talking for about half an hour. Commander Chen has been ill for nearly a month. According to attending physician Chen Cheng, Commander Chen has been doing well in recent days. His diet and actions are normal, and his back pain has completely healed. A stone in his waist and ribs has been discharged and no further surgery is needed. He can be discharged from the hospital after three to five days of rest.</p>
<h3>Chambers of Commerce and Others Nominated Employer Representatives for the International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Ministry of Industry Yesterday for Submission to the National Government for Appointment</p>
<p>The 18th International Labour Conference, decided by the 64th session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, will be held in Geneva on May 11, 1934. The Ministry of Industry previously notified the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to jointly nominate attendees with the China National Federation of Industries and submit them to the government for appointment. The Federation has now jointly nominated Wang Zhisheng as the employer representative of the Republic of China to attend the 18th International Labour Conference, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for submission to the National Government for appointment. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Presenting the matter of complying with the order to jointly nominate employer representatives to attend the 18th International Labour Conference and requesting submission to the National Government for appointment. It is humbly noted that the reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guozi No. 522, in the notification from your Ministry, Laborzi No. 2582, dated December 18 of last year, stated that the 64th session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office decided that the 18th International Labour Conference would be convened in Geneva on May 11 of next year, requesting that it be noted. The current Conference is for the election of members of the Governing Body, and in order for our country to participate in the election, all attendees should be decided as soon as possible in order to prepare and facilitate the process. The methods for sending representatives and consultant secretaries to attend the current Conference have been proposed by this Ministry and passed by the Executive Yuan. All methods for sending employer representatives and consultant secretaries will still be proposed jointly by the China National Federation of Industries and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and submitted to the government for appointment as before. The nomination of these candidates is urgently needed, in addition to issuing separate instructions, we are notifying the Federation to immediately jointly nominate these personnel with the China National Federation of Industries and report to the Ministry for submission for appointment.

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Correction of Tianjin's Illegal Collection of Teeth Tax</h3>
<p>Fruit Industry Representatives Go to Tianjin to Petition</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Beiping Political Affairs Branch of the Executive Yuan and the Hebei Provincial Government, stating that the teeth tax originated in the Qing Dynasty and has been continued since the Republic of China. Its nature is a business tax levied on specially licensed businesses. Therefore, the teeth tax post and the tax are often mentioned together. The target of taxation is shops, not goods, which is different from the Likin tax. The tax amount is usually determined by the remoteness of the area, the size of the shop, and its grade. Therefore, each teeth tax post, even in prosperous areas, and according to the type of business, those who should receive the first-class teeth tax post pay up to several yuan. Among them, there are examples of long-term teeth tax posts that are limited to being renewed every twenty years. Such a situation is clearly verifiable. The scope of teeth tax post registration and tax payment is limited to tooth rows. The so-called tooth row refers to the tooth brokers who buy and sell on behalf of customers. Self-purchase and self-sale, those who do not operate by collecting commissions, are of course not within the scope of teeth tax. However, the interim regulations on teeth tax formulated by Tianjin Municipality are completely different from this. Article 3 of its regulations states that the teeth tax rate should not exceed 3% of the price of goods and should be borne by both the buyer and seller, with the buyer bearing 2% and the seller bearing 1% in principle. According to this method, it is clearly a goods tax rather than a teeth tax post. Therefore, the teeth tax collection office levies tax on each batch of goods transported from other places or from other places to Tianjin, and issues tax bills. The text printed on the tax bill states, "This tax bill is issued so that the bureaus and checkpoints along the way can check the freight bills and stamp them for release without delay or obstruction. If there are any discrepancies such as concealed goods or mismatched freight bills, they will be detained and punished without leniency." This is clearly a Likin checkpoint. This is by no means a so-called teeth tax post. This is the actual situation of the current teeth tax in Tianjin, which violates the national government's order to abolish Likin. Furthermore, in terms of the Tianjin fresh goods teeth tax, it is divided into two major markets, located in the Xihe and Yuhe areas. There has never been a tooth row in the Haihe area. It is of a passing-through or self-purchasing and self-selling nature. In September of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Tianjin authorities recruited merchants to contract the teeth tax and added the Haihe area. The contractor Zhao Yuqi won the bid. Tianjin merchants protested for three months because there had never been a teeth tax in the Haihe area. Zhao withdrew from the contract. Finally, the Tianjin Fresh and Dried Fruits Industry Guild requested that the Haihe be exempted from the teeth tax and changed to an annual apportionment of 37,000 yuan for all fresh fruits, regardless of north or south. In September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the guild's contract expired. In February of this year, a new merchant, Chen Xizhi, won the bid with 150,800 yuan, five times the previous amount. After taking over, he recruited more than 300 teeth tax clerks and set up offices along the way to check everywhere. Regardless of whether they were carrying goods on their shoulders or in small quantities, even if they were not going through the tooth row, they had to be assessed and taxed. They also intercepted and taxed goods passing through the Haihe area. If their demands were not met, they would detain the goods and arrest people to show their power. Two batches of sugarcane and tangerines from Shanghai to Tianjin have been detained. After the two batches of goods were detained, the Shanghai Fruit and Local Goods Industry Guild sent a telegram to the Mayor of Tianjin with some statements. The Mayor of Tianjin replied in a telegram that he did not mention whether the teeth tax was levied according to the price of the goods, whether the goods should be taxed once they arrived, and a tax bill issued, so that the bureaus and checkpoints along the way could check and stamp them, whether each was a teeth tax, regardless of whether they were carrying goods on their shoulders or in small quantities, whether they were going through the tooth row, and whether officials should be sent to intercept and detain goods passing through the Haihe area. He only attributed this matter to the replacement of contractors and the guild's failure to contract. This avoided the legal point of contention and focused on the defense of trivial matters. Shanghai fruit merchants, under these circumstances, believed that the municipal government had no way to appeal and requested to appeal to the higher-level competent authorities. The chairman of the Shanghai Fruit and Local Goods Industry Guild, Cai Run, requested to attend the meeting. As mentioned above, the teeth tax should not be levied on each item. The Haihe area has always been without tooth brokers. Where do the tooth brokers come from? This is especially the focus of Tianjin fresh fruit merchants. Respectfully, a special representative was sent to bring the petition to the front to petition, hoping that it would be approved that the collection of fresh goods teeth tax in Tianjin violates the tax law and contradicts the Likin abolition plan, and that it should be corrected.</p>

<h3>Seeing Things, Thinking of People, Difficult to Rejoin the Broken Mirror, Kang Keling Girl's Fragrant Nest Destroyed</h3>
<p>Since the Couple has Already Separated, Both Parties Have No Restrictions</p>
<p>Yao Wenhui is Out of Reach and Destroys Everything</p>
<p>Resulting in Double Charges of Damage and Theft</p>
<p>A clerk in the stationery department of Shui'an Company, the most famous Ms. Kang Keling, is famous for her beautiful name, and her Kang clothing, her social activity, is especially praised, so she has won the pursuit of the opposite sex. Since she has retired to the back for two years, Ms.'s fragrant name has not been mentioned by people. I do not know that the river of love she has passed has just arrived in the middle of the stream.</p>
<h3>Changes into a Sea of ​​Hate</h3>
<p>Now she is actually facing her divorced husband in court. Therefore, the process of her separation and the cause of the lawsuit are described as follows: Ms. was originally from Weiyang, her name is Tan Shuqing, she is 22 years old this year, and the reason why she got the name of Kang Keling is because she specialized in selling Kang Keling ink pens when she served in Yong'an. At that time, a group of erotic fanatics pursued Ms., and they all scrambled to be the first, and as a result, Yao Wenhui got it. Yao is from Jiang, and Chang Tan is three years old. He is beautiful and talented, and he is married, which is really</p>
<h3>A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>Then on September 17th of the year before last, the wedding was held at Moore Church on Sanma Road. Unexpectedly, the two parties could not maintain a happy love after their marriage. On October 12th of last year, they suddenly divorced. Tan hired lawyer Wang and Yao hired lawyer Chen to negotiate the divorce and sign the agreement. A son, the crystallization of love, was taken away by Tan to raise him. From then on, the husband and wife separated, and the two never met again. Tan then took his beloved son and lived in Room 2 of No. 10, Lane 15, Kader Road,</p>
<h3>Foreign Apartment</h3>
<p>However, since the divorce, Yao has not been able to completely forget Tan, so he must visit the apartment every week. When the beloved son and wife are facing each other, the past cannot help but be recalled. People are not made of wood or stone, so who can be ruthless? Therefore, Yao deeply desires to rejoin the broken mirror, but Tan sees it indifferently, making it difficult to speak. At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yao visited again. Tan had already gone out. The tea boy of the apartment, Li Qingquan, allowed him to open the door and enter the room because Yao was a regular customer. Yao entered the room and saw things and thought of people. Out of jealousy, he took</p>
<h3>Sharp Scissors</h3>
<p>a pair, and a kitchen knife, and cut or cut the clothes and bedding that Tan placed in the room. Even a shoe or a sock was destroyed, and all the hard things such as cups and basins were smashed. All the things in the room were not intact. The destruction work lasted for an hour. Then he took paper to write, writing several passages, mostly claiming that Tan Xueqing would not heal, was arbitrary and romantic, abused love, and liked to make friends with the opposite sex. The names of certain people involved in the book remained even when he left, so he put the burning match on the bed, imitating</p>
<h3>Chu People Lighting a Fire</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Li Qingquan passed by the window after Yao left and saw smoke in the room. He took the water to extinguish the fire and was able to avoid burning the house. At 11:00 PM, Ms. Tan returned to the apartment and saw the mess in the room. After being told the details by Li, she reported to the Xinzha Police Station, saying that the damaged items were estimated to be worth 1,500 yuan. In addition, the 35 yuan of Zhongnan banknotes in the wallet were also stolen. The chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives Xu Huanqing and Bother to come to No. 3, Shanghai Villa, Huanlong Road, French Concession,</p>
<h3>Yao Wenhui's Home</h3>
<p>to search, but Yao did not return home, so there was nothing to gain. Then, according to Tan, Yao is fond of dancing and stays in various dance halls every night. The detectives then took Ms. Tan to look for Yao in various dance halls. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, they found Yao in the La Lihua Garden dance hall. Yao still wanted to resist arrest, and his friends echoed him from the side, but he was eventually captured. At 9:00 AM, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu Zuzu conducted the trial. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu clarified the case and presented the 10 yuan of Zhongnan banknotes and two dominoes that were found in the defendant's pocket, saying that these were all stolen goods and requested that they be punished according to the law. Tan Xueqing explained</p>
<h3>The Destroyed Objects</h3>
<p>The situation was explained, and the defendant was questioned. He admitted without hesitation to the destruction of the objects, saying that yesterday he went to the plaintiff's place to take her home, but he decided to destroy them after seeing the plaintiff's gorgeous clothes, because without beautiful clothes, she could not be fashionable, and without being fashionable, she could not be romantic, and without being romantic, she would be difficult to make friends with the opposite sex, so she could avoid falling in the future. As for the banknotes, I thought they were illegally obtained, so I tore them up and threw them out the window, and did not take them, etc. After the interrogation, Judge Wu immediately sentenced the defendant to a fine of 100 yuan for the crime of destruction and a fine of 50 yuan for the crime of theft, and ordered him to pay a fine of 120 yuan, and the stolen goods were handed over to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Pu'an Renovated and Reopened</h3>
<p>Tomorrow First Flight</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qingdao liner Pu'an was seriously damaged after being hit by the Blue Funnel Line's Philoctetes. It was immediately sent to the Jiangnan Shipyard for major repairs. All the work was completed yesterday. Because Qingdao has a large amount of inventory waiting to be shipped and there are many passengers with first-class seats, the company has decided to resume normal flights starting tomorrow. The issue of responsibility for the collision will be determined after both parties conduct a public trial.</p>
<h3>Salt Tide Enters Songkou Again</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been sunny and warm, and the tide in Wusong has shrunk, causing seawater to invade again. When the water rose the day before yesterday, the water tasted salty, and it was even worse yesterday. Most of the residents of Songdi had stored fresh water in advance, so they were not affected by the salt tide. If the salt tide does not recede again, the tap water in this port will also have a salty taste.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Breaks Three Gambling Dens in a Row</h3>
<p>A Total of Twenty-Eight People Arrested</p>
<p>Recently, Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has noted that during the Chinese New Year, many idle citizens often take the opportunity to gamble. Although repeated orders have been issued, the gambling trend has not been curbed. Therefore, he secretly ordered his subordinates to strictly ban gambling. As a result, a group of gamblers have been migrating and avoiding in various ways. They even gamble on ships, hoping to escape the eyes and ears of the police. However, in the past two days, the Inspectorate and the Police Brigade have cracked down on three gambling dens. Two of them were seized on ships, and they are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Xin Ning Shao</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, on the Xin Ning Shao ship at the Ning Shao Wharf, gamblers Tong Arong, Xu Liexin, Li Amao, Wang Yongkang, Yin Ruigen, Zhang Heshang, Shen Longfu, Bao Acai, Wang Menghong, Zhao Sitang, Huang Pinchai, and other eleven people were seized, along with the gambling tools and capital, and taken to the headquarters for punishment.</p>
<h3>Hong Xing Wheel</h3>
<p>The night before last, a gambling den was cracked down on the Hong Xing Wheel in Nanshi, and a total of eight gamblers, Wu Wenhua, Qian Atang, Chen Jincai, Bao Arong, Gong Tingnan, Dong Jinrong, Wang Kaishi, and Zhang Shunfa, were seized, and all gambling tools and gambling capital were seized, and they were sent to the Judicial Division for trial.</p>
<h3>Nine Mu Land</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Section Chief Shen of the First Section of the Second District of Nanshi led many police officers to the home of Li Ruisheng at No. 43, Nine Mu Land, and cracked down on a gambling case. The gambling head Li Ruilong was arrested on the spot, and the gamblers Li Mengsheng, Zhou Changyi, Xu Laosan, Ling Shoukui, and other nine people were arrested, along with the gambling tools, and were sent to the Third Section for trial.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Hai'an Donates Money to Liang Tongfang</h3>
<p>Liang Refuses and Returns the Money</p>
<p>Health Slightly Recovered, Will Visit Tang</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang, an anti-Japanese patriot, was deeply saddened by the national crisis and the plight of his comrades. He witnessed it with pain and developed a sense of world-weariness. On the 25th of last month, he attempted to commit suicide by smoking opium at the Lao Dongfang Flag Club. Fortunately, the tea servant noticed and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, and he was out of danger. Liang's family led him out of the hospital for recuperation at about 3:00 PM on the 26th of last month. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. According to reports, Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs in this city, was very sympathetic after seeing the news of Liang's suicide attempt in the newspapers. At about 8:00 PM on the 26th of last month, he ordered a confidant to bring a letter to Renji Hospital to inquire about and comfort him, and attached 20 yuan in silver dollars to donate to Liang to maintain his temporary living expenses. At that time, the hospital called lawyer Yao Zhaoli because Liang had been discharged from the hospital at about 3:00 PM that afternoon, asking Liang to come to the hospital to bring the money and letter. Liang believed that other people's money could not be obtained without labor, so he still asked the visitor to return the donated money. The letter brought by Tang is recorded as follows: "Comrade Tongfang, I just read the newspaper and learned about the situation. Please come to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office at No. 133, Xinzha Road, for a chat after you recover from the treatment. At the same time, please take care and be cautious for the country. My brother is young and intelligent, and has a bright future. Why do you need to do this? I hereby present 20 yuan of national currency. Please check and receive it. I wish you a speedy recovery. Sincerely, Tang Hai'an, February 26th." On the 27th of last month, Liang also sent a letter to Tang, stating the reason why he did not accept Tang's assistance. It is also recorded as follows: "Kaiyuan, please review. Yesterday, I received your letter and learned everything. Tongfang is uneducated and deeply loved and assisted. I am very grateful. I think what I cannot endure is actually the spirit, not the material. Brother Minsheng still shines shoes for a living as a major general. How can a little boy like me not pull a rickshaw to make a living? Even if I don't pull a rickshaw, I can maintain my food, clothing, housing, etc. There is absolutely no problem. However, I see that China, as a nation with the longest culture and the most prosperous population, is drunk and dreaming, numb and indifferent, suffers insults and does not resist, and fights brothers in the country. It is so sad. Tongfang cannot kill enemies on the battlefield to fulfill his responsibilities as a commoner. He only lives like a slave of a fallen country. I would rather die quickly. Therefore, the idea of ​​suicide arises spontaneously. Now, after being rescued by Renji Hospital and escaping danger, and after being persuaded by Mr. Yao Zhaoli, I feel that although this life is not as heavy as Mount Tai, I am not willing to be as light as a feather. Therefore, as soon as I recover my health, I will immediately listen to your instructions to follow. I am grateful for your assistance, and I will ask your friend to bring it back. I hope you will forgive me. Sincerely, I wish you good health. Liang Tongfang, February 27th."</p>
<h3>Fourth Series of Books Continued Reservation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Commercial Press published the Fourth Series of Books in the eighth year of the Republic of China. The books collected are all rare and good books that are not seen in the world. Therefore, both editions have sold as many as 5,000 copies. Since its publication, scholars at home and abroad have requested that the sequel be printed for more than ten years. The library has responded to the needs of the times and is preparing to continue the sequel, searching extensively and collecting dozens of hundreds of thousands of volumes of fine manuscripts from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Mr. Zhang Jusheng, a director of the library, also personally went overseas and traveled to the two capitals to seek information. Collectors at home and abroad have produced rare and unusual books for assistance. Before January 28, the library had compiled the complete list of the sequel, which was more beautiful and rich than the first edition. Just as it was about to be sold for reservation, the Japanese army disturbed Shanghai, and the library's general factory and Oriental Library were destroyed. Fortunately, the fine copies included in the sequel were mostly stored in external warehouses and were not completely destroyed. Since the resumption of business, the library has reorganized and started selling reservations for the Fourth Series of Books Sequel on January 15 of this year. It is stipulated that about 10 volumes will be published every week, and 500 volumes will be published every year. It is printed with the beginning of editing and printing, and includes the books planned to be published this year and next year. Those who see this list say that the elites of East Asian collectors are all gathered here. This is not a false reputation. The publication method is also as convenient as the first edition. Those who purchase reservations and those who purchase individual species can view them on schedule first. The books published in January and February, such as the Song Dynasty edition of Mr. Donglai's Poetry Collection, the Song Dynasty edition of the Pingzhai Collection, the Song Dynasty edition of the Kuotanlu, and the Zhuoguge edition of the Huijian Qianlu Houlu Sanlu Yuhua, are all lost books in China, and the only remaining copies in the world. In addition, there are huge productions such as Taiping Yulan and Cefu Yuangui, which were not even prepared by the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, the Jiaqing's Revised Unified History, 560 volumes, only has the present copy and has never been printed. Now all of them have been obtained by the library and included in the sequel, which is truly an unprecedented great cause in the East Asian publishing world.</p>
<h3>Number of Visitors to the Public Concession Park</h3>
<p>According to the report of the director of the Public Concession Park Management Department in January, the number of visitors this month was 26,233 for Zhao Sheng Park and the Zoo, 54,677 for Hongkou Park, 7,966 for the Bund Park, and 34,887 for Huishan, Zhoushan, Singapore, and various parks, and Nanyang Road, Suzhou Road, and Kunshan Square. The total number of visitors was 123,763.</p>
<h3>Son Threatens Mother with Gun for Extortion</h3>
<p>Purchased a Six-Chambered Old, Rusty Handgun from a Used Goods Stall</p>
<p>Aimed at His Elderly Mother, Who Was Extremely Frightened and Called for Help</p>
<p>Ding Wang, a local old woman residing at No. 2, Tedeli, Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, is 66 years old. She has a son named Afu, who is 33 years old this year. He used to work in a rice shop, but due to improper behavior, he has been unemployed since. He is lazy, has a base nature, and is addicted to vices. Lacking any skills to make a living, he daily demands money from his mother for his expenses. Recently, his mother, Ding Wang, unable to bear his constant demands and having no means to provide for them, has sternly refused and denied him any money each time Afu asks. Unexpectedly, Afu came up with a bizarre idea: he spent money to buy a six-chambered automatic old, rusty handgun from a used goods stall in the Chinese area. It had no bullets. He intended to use it to threaten his mother when asking for money. If she refused, he could use the gun to intimidate her, and she would be forced to give him money out of fear. He felt very pleased with himself. One night before, around 9 PM, Afu went home with the gun and demanded money from his mother in a forceful tone. Wang, not understanding his intention, refused. Afu immediately pulled out the handgun from his side, aimed it at his mother, pretending to shoot, in order to threaten and coerce her into giving him several silver dollars. His mother was terrified and screamed for help. Neighbors, hearing the noise, came to inquire. The old woman told them what had happened. Upon learning the truth, the neighbors condemned Afu's actions. Ding Wang had the neighbors help her bind Afu with ropes. She then rushed to the French police station to report that there were robbers in her house committing robbery, requesting them to arrest them immediately. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately dispatched a large squad of Chinese and foreign detectives, armed and wearing steel vests, in a police car to rush to the address to surround and capture the suspects. When the detectives arrived at the old woman's house, they saw no trace of robbers, only Afu bound and lying on the ground with the handgun placed on the table. They questioned the old woman and learned the truth: it was her son threatening her with a gun to extort money. They untied Afu and took him and the handgun to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Yao Zhaodi, presented the case, stating that the police station still needed to conduct a detailed investigation and requested that the defendant be remanded in custody for two weeks for further investigation and interrogation. He also submitted the handgun as evidence. The plaintiff, Ding Wang, then testified about her son's threatening her with a gun and demanding money. Afu's testimony was evasive. The court ordered a further hearing on March 9, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>The Second Collection of Yue Yuan's Secret Manuscript Will Be Published</h3>
<p>Widely Collects Lost Sayings of Past Generations</p>
<p>Extensively Gathers Unique Words from Ancient and Modern Times</p>
<p>Compiled into a Rare Secret Manuscript</p>
<p>After the publication of the first collection of Yue Yuan's publications in the Siming Series, scholars across the country regarded it as a model because it extensively collected lost sayings of past generations and gathered unique words from ancient and modern times. Now, Mr. Zhang Yongni has compiled the second collection, extensively gathering rare editions and collecting from classics, culling and adding whatever is sufficient to instruct the world, into 171 volumes, which have already been sent for engraving and are expected to be published next month. The essence of the second collection is even greater than that of the first. Upon investigation, there are countless famous books and records in Siming throughout history, numbering thousands, but more than half have been lost due to the distance of time. Even those that occasionally survive are often unclear due to errors and omissions in the text. For example, Sun Shiyi's "Textual Research on the Extraneous Records," "Collection of Mr. Xuechu," "Record of Hermitage on Bian Mountain," "Remaining Drafts of Qingxi," "Posthumous Collection of Chen Liangmo," "Guo Yiyan," "Complete Collection of Qian Sule," "Special Collection of Xue Weng," "Forbidden Drafts of Yuyi," "Collection of Zhang Huanjing," "Posthumous Writings of Vice Minister Feng," "Posthumous Works of Wang Yi," "Grave Records of the Two Vice Ministers Feng and Wang," "Remaining Affairs of Liujingtang," "Collection of Tunyuezi," "Record of Upright Qi in Xuejiaoting," "Unofficial History of Haidong," "Record of Loyalty and Righteousness in the Song Dynasty," "Ready-Made Words," "Drafts of Supervising Villages," "Chronological Literary Drafts of Qianzhicaotang," "Words of Advice from Cuncaolu," and 22 other kinds, all of which are secretly kept at home. After Mr. Zhang's careful analysis, collection of lost items, and comparison of discrepancies, they have been formed into a unique collection. The set is priced at 50 yuan, and pre-orders are 40 yuan. If both sets are pre-ordered, the price is only 80 yuan. It is sold on behalf of Aiwenyi Road, Jueyuan No. 11.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting and Dinner of the Nanyang Alumni Association</h3>
<p>Held at the New Asia Hotel on March 10th</p>
<p>The Nanyang Public School Alumni Association will hold its annual meeting and dinner at the New Asia Hotel New Building on Beisichuan Road and Tiantong Road on March 10th.

Alumni from Beijing, Shanghai, and surrounding areas will definitely bring their families to join in the fun. Tickets are priced at 2.50 yuan per person and can be purchased at the association (Mainland Commercial Plaza No. 540) before March 5th in order to reserve seats.</p>
<h3>Telephone Installed in Sanlintang, Pudong</h3>
<p>Sanlintang Town in Pudong, Shanghai County, has always been a prosperous commercial center and an important thoroughfare. The Fourth District Office, recognizing that the town's lack of telephone service has caused delays in communication, which is crucial for local defense and autonomous development, has raised substantial funds through District Chief Fu Dianying's efforts and hired workers to install the service. The switchboard is located inside the District Office. The majority of the work has now been completed, and the sound quality is very clear. It is reported that the District Office will negotiate with the city to connect the service to the urban area after all the work is completed, in order to facilitate communication.</p>
<h3>The Italian Consulate Investigates Two Italians in the Jardine Matheson Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Continued Hearing Next Monday</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, Italians Tangbulinis and his son were accused of being involved in the fraud case against Jardine Matheson Bank. Yesterday (February 27), they were interrogated again by the police court of the Italian Consulate. The Russian Aiani and Jiaxing, who have already been convicted in the same case, both testified that Tang had signed checks to withdraw money from the Guohua Bank. The name signed was J. Rice. Tang's son had deposited a fake check for 136,688.25 yuan into the Guohua Bank. Aiani also claimed that Tang's son did not dare to deposit the second fake check for over 188,000 yuan, so Jiaxing took it. Tang received about 5,300 yuan, and his son received 2,800 yuan. Aiani produced a piece of paper with many J. Rice written on it, which Tang had used to practice his signature. Sang Qimu claimed that he went to Puxi Western Firm on January 15 to collect money and personally saw Tang sign a check.

<h3>Crowlae Detained on a Small Boat</h3>
<p>Waiting for a Convenient Ship to Send Him Back to the United States</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, Crowlae, who was sentenced two years ago to one year of imprisonment on McLeer Island for smuggling opium from China to various cities on the west coast of the United States, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (February 27) afternoon on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru. The Passport Management Officer of the Public Security Bureau refused him permission to land because his passport had expired in 1930 and had not been approved by Chinese consular officials in the United States or Japan. The real reason, it is said, is that Crowlae is inherently restless, and it is feared that he will resume opium trafficking in China. The original intention was to send Crowlae back to his point of departure on the same ship, but the crew of the Shanghai Maru refused to take him. Therefore, Crowlae is temporarily detained on a small boat in the Huangpu River, waiting for a convenient ship to send him back to the United States. The reason for detaining him on a small boat is that if he were detained in Nanshi, the Chinese officials would have no right to detain him and would have to hand him over to the US Consulate. It is said that the Public Security Bureau informed the US Consul General in Shanghai in advance. Crowlae was the first person to import ice cream into Shanghai, hence the nickname "Ice Cream Man."</p>

<h3>The Dadao Bookstore Case Postponed</h3>
<p>The textbooks published by Dadao Bookstore contain a subject that uses telegrams as teaching materials. The telegram sent to Beiping takes two days, which was discovered by the members of the Electric Administration Public Welfare Association of the Ministry of Communications. They believe that the police's statement is not true and that using it as a school textbook will give readers a bad impression of the Electric Administration and greatly affect the telegram business. The president of the association, He Jiacheng, and the vice president, Yu Ziran, in order to maintain the reputation of the Electric Administration, specially hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint of defamation with the First Special District Court against Shen Junsheng and Jiang Xicen, the persons in charge of Dadao Bookstore, and Hu Yanli, Zhang Ruonan, Lu Changkang, and Chen Zhizhong, who compiled the book, requesting that they be punished according to the law.

Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang of the First Special Court held a hearing to summon Hu, Zhang, Lu, and Chen, the four defendants who compiled the book, but they were all in Nanjing and could not surrender themselves. The two defendants, Shen and Jiang, hired a lawyer to appear in court and stated that they are currently in the process of mediation and requested a postponement. The plaintiff's lawyer did not object, so Judge Huang postponed the hearing to March 14th afternoon.</p>

<h3>Robbery in Guqing Lane, Fangbang Road</h3>
<p>Loss of Property Worth Over a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Robbers Opened Fire, Fortunately No One Was Injured</p>
<p>Zhang Ruibo, a local resident of Guqing Lane No. 1, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, is 35 years old and has been working in the banknote room of the Bank of Communications on the Bund for more than ten years. His life is still considered affluent. Zhang is generous and extravagant, which has been coveted by bandits. One day before yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, four robbers with local and Ningbo accents, wearing bronze-colored long gowns and blue cloth long coats, and wearing copper basin hats, carrying two handguns, knocked on Zhang's door under the pretext of visiting Zhang Ruibo. Chen Buxiang (27 years old), a coachman from Yancheng at Zhang's house, opened the door and welcomed them in, and replied that Zhang was not at home. Unexpectedly, the robbers had already pulled out their handguns and threatened the coachman. Then they drove the housemaid and others into the Shun Chun Flower Edge Company opened by Shen Bing, which was located in the downstairs wing, and imprisoned them. One robber watched over them and guarded the gate. The other three robbers rushed upstairs to the bedroom of Ling Xiangsheng's mother (Zhang's mother-in-law) in the living room and Zhang's room in the wing. They used kitchen knives to pry open the cabinets and drawers, and robbed more than 300 yuan in cash and a ring, worth more than 500 yuan. They also took a gold ring inlaid with a cat's-eye gemstone, which was deposited by Ms. Xiang Zhilian, who lived in the same lane at No. 2. It was of great value. At that time, the housemaid of the landlord, surnamed Chen, walked back to the drying platform from the grass room upstairs. The robber caught a glimpse of her and grabbed her. The maid screamed for help. The robber was anxious and fired a shot. Fortunately, it did not hit her. The bullet destroyed a hole in the willow Goubi in the east pavilion of the atrium, and the bullet landed in the drainpipe there. The robbers then fled through the main gate. Afterwards, after checking the lost property, the municipal Public Security Bureau, District 1, was notified. At the time, Zhang's wife carried out a pearl necklace that she had borrowed from a relative with the surname of Someone, but it has not been returned, so it was not stolen. Only when Zhang's wife returned home did she find out.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Re-Appeals to the National Government to Establish a Rayon Factory</h3>
<p>Requests Reduction of Import Tax Before the Factory Is Established</p>
<p>In order to rescue the critically endangered domestic silk industry, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association submitted a request to the National Government in November of last year to allocate funds to establish a rayon silk factory. However, a long time has passed, and no approval has been received. Therefore, yesterday, they resubmitted it to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the factory be established quickly. The original text is extracted as follows: "A report is hereby submitted to continue the discussion and sincerely request approval for the rapid establishment of a rayon factory, in order to save the silk industry from the current crisis. The association held a meeting of representatives of the silk industry guilds from the two provinces in January of last year, and resolved to request a loan of 20 million US dollars from the US Cotton Commission to establish a rayon factory to rescue the endangered domestic silk, etc. A special report has been submitted to the case. Now, the silk industry is even more depressed and unsustainable. The number of factories that have closed down is increasing. Even those that survive are in danger of collapsing. Alas, the domestic silk, which is famous for its silk, has such a phenomenon of being on the verge of extinction. What is the reason? The association has investigated the causes and will report them in detail. First, silk merchants adhere to old methods and use all-natural silk for weaving silk, without improving it, resulting in products that are not beautiful in color and are not as pretty as rayon foreign silk, and the price is too high, and sales are not widespread. Because various woven silk fabrics and silk goods made of foreign rayon are sold in abundance, our country's officials and people compete with them because they are pretty and bright in color, and they buy them one after another. As a result, domestic silk has been greatly dwarfed and cannot compete, and it has fallen sharply to the point of being eliminated. Later, enthusiastic people went to foreign countries to investigate and practice silk weaving, and learned all its secrets. After returning to China, they imitated the foreign silk weaving method and also took rayon to interweave into silk. Its beautiful color is indeed similar to that of foreign silk, and the price is low and the quality is good. As a result, the sales gradually expanded, and China's silk industry slightly improved. However, due to natural disasters and man-made disasters, foreign aggression and internal strife, traffic congestion has come one after another, and rayon imports have been repeatedly taxed, resulting in high costs of domestic silk, which is not as good as foreign silk, resulting in a slump in business. Moreover, the Eastern neighbors do not tax the import of foreign rayon, which is higher than the tax in our country, so the cost of Eastern silk is light, and our silk merchants have to buy heavily taxed rayon raw materials to make silk, and the price of silk is naturally expensive. Comparing the two, the difficulty of selling is self-evident. No wonder China's silk industry is on the verge of failure. However, if we want to protect the survival and revival of domestic silk, it is important to establish our own rayon factory, study the products carefully, and produce a large amount for national needs. Otherwise, the silk will be even more chaotic, and domestic silk will not be able to survive. The association held a meeting of representatives of silk industry guilds from the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang this month to discuss the relief of the silk industry and jointly studied the matter. It was resolved that: (1) We will continue to submit a request to the government to establish a rayon factory as soon as possible, in order to provide fundamental relief. (2) Before a rayon factory is established, we should increase the import tax on rayon in order to reduce the cost of domestic silk, so that it will not be sold by foreign silk, and we should increase the import tax on foreign rayon woven products in order to mix with domestic silk. The association investigated that rayon silk has almost become a necessary raw material for weaving silk, and there is no possibility of eliminating it. It is necessary to find a way to make it ourselves and use it as much as possible, in order to save the silk from danger, and both the national economy and people's livelihood will benefit. It is not something that can be resisted by taxation. The higher the rayon tax rate, the heavier the cost of domestic silk and the slower the sales, the easier it is for foreign silk to be sold, and the more foreign silk is sold, the more domestic silk is defeated. The association, in order to maintain the livelihood of workers in silk weaving factories in the two provinces, hereby follows the weaving and submits a report to respectfully request the National Government (Yuan, Council, Ministry) to approve and implement it, and we are eagerly awaiting orders.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Society Begins Recruiting Members Today</h3>
<p>Banquet for All Circles Held at the Great Eastern Restaurant Last Night</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Red Cross Society promulgated the relevant regulations and implementation details, it has been actively carrying out its affairs. Now, with the approval of the Ministry of Interior, it will begin recruiting members from March 1st to April 30th. Following the precedents of various countries, the Chairman of the National Government and the ministers of various ministries are invited to be honorary commanders-in-chief. The president of the association, Wang Yiting, the vice president, Chen Qiaqing, the standing committee members Zhu Xiaoji, Zan Hanzhi, Wen Linting, Guan Lanzhi, and Wang Dujiu, a total of seven people, will be the standing committee members for recruiting members. They will open today and plan to train wartime paramedics, purchase rescue materials, and acquire offshore hospital ships after the recruitment of members is closed. They will also train foreign language nurses in preparation for wartime. However, China has never had an offshore hospital ship. Some people mistakenly believe that merchant ships can be transformed. If this is successful, it will be a new era in China's maritime hygiene history. Last night at 7 o'clock, the association held a banquet for all circles at the Great Eastern Restaurant. Standing Committee Member Wang Peiyuan presided over the meeting, and dozens of guests and reporters from all circles attended. They dispersed at about 9 o'clock, and the hosts and guests all enjoyed themselves.</p>
<h3>"Tai Shun" Boat Hook Damaged</h3>
<p>Loss Less Than Ten Yuan</p>
<p>No Negotiation with Sanbei</p>
<p>The "Tai Shun" ship of the China Merchants Bureau, which arrived in Beijing from Fujian this time, was setting sail back to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The "Feng Pu" ship of the Sanbei Company, heading straight to Fuzhou, was also at the same pier and sailed first. During the voyage, it collided with and damaged two of the "Tai Shun" ship's davits holding the sampan. The damage was very minor, so it was not taken seriously. When the "Tai Shun" returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th, the shipowner, Yang Xiang, immediately reported the "Feng Pu" ship's collision with the davits to the bureau. At that time, the shipowner and the bureau's engineering personnel inspected and estimated the loss to be less than ten yuan. After the inspection by the shipping department, it was determined that there was no need to negotiate with Sanbei and that the repairs could be done by themselves, costing at most five or six yuan to complete.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang Sumin's Talk on the Silver Price Issue</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Sumin, Director of the Banking Department of National Jinan University, gave a speech yesterday on the silver price issue, saying that there is a strong voice in the US Congress to raise the price of silver. Some advocate setting the gold-silver ratio at 1:20, and some even advocate setting the ratio at 1:12. Today's market price is 1:70. If the silver price is artificially raised several times, it will undoubtedly disrupt China's exchange rate and commodity prices. There are two ways for our country to defend itself: First, implement an export tax on silver, with the tax rate depending on the extent to which the US government raises the price of silver. The effect of this method is equivalent to prohibiting the export of silver, but not as drastic. However, it is necessary to prevent the smuggling of silver and Chinese banks' depositors from withdrawing cash and depositing it in foreign banks at the same time. Second, the Chinese government should not only allow people to transport silver out, but also transport it out in large quantities to buy US dollars or gold bars as a basis for changing the monetary standard. At the same time, it must decouple domestic currency from the silver standard. I think these methods are all worthy of research, but their relationship is complex and cannot be easily explained.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Asks to Kindly Transfer Displaced Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>

<p>A Total of Fifty-Three Men and Women</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that fifty-three displaced refugees, both men and women, from Baoding, escaped from the flood last year and came to Shanghai after many twists and turns, requesting relief and repatriation. Yesterday, they specifically wrote to the Xinwei Relief Society in this city to arrange for their repatriation. The original letter is recorded as follows: "According to the refugees Li Ziwei and others' report to the bureau, 'We, a total of fifty-two men, women, and children, are all from Hejian, Baoding. We escaped from the flood last year and came to Shanghai after many twists and turns. Our hometown is still able to be settled down, and our wives and children are sick again, so we are very eager to return home, but we have no money for travel and can only sigh helplessly. Now, we earnestly request relief and repatriation,' etc. According to this, these people, supporting the old and carrying the young, have been wandering in a foreign land, which is truly pitiful. Now, we specially prepare a letter and send Yin Guanzhi, the director of the relief section of this bureau, to hold the investment meeting, hoping that you will investigate, arrange for reception, and repatriate them back to their hometowns. This is to the Xinwei Relief Society, attached is a list of refugees. Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau."</p>

I hereby request you to correct this. Sincerely, Jin Chuxiang.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Where Should One Start When Studying International Issues? (3)</p>
<p>When studying international issues, first, we should stand from the perspective of historical materialism and pay special attention to the economic background. All international phenomena are reflections of global economic changes. Studying today's international issues without considering the capitalist economic system and its dynamics is just wishful thinking. To understand recent international events, we must understand the characteristics of the economic panic in the third period of capitalism. Capitalism's attempt to ease economic panic and political crises through mutual compromise had suffered a final defeat in 1933. Consequently, 1934 naturally entered a stage of more blatant preparation for war. On this basis, there will inevitably be the Paris massacre, the street fighting in Austria, the US buying up silver, the arms race, secret treaties, and the conclusion of alliances. At the same time, they will jointly launch an offensive against China and jointly deploy an anti-Soviet war. All of this constitutes the current international situation, and its foundation lies in the collapse of the capitalist economy. The direction of the world economy has turned to a new direction. This is the root of all international disputes and the clue to analyzing international issues.</p>
<p>First, we should study from the fluidity of the past, the unity of contradictions. The occurrence of each international event is a product of a certain stage in the process and is also contradictory, mutually opposed, and unified within a certain category. All international phenomena have certain cause-and-effect relationships, which are continuous movements. We can only obtain the truth about international issues in a dynamic state. For example, let's talk about the League of Nations. The League of Nations was originally an organization for Anglo-French-Italian-Japanese power chauvinists to carve up small nations, colonies, and suppress world revolutions. It has been developing until now, and although its essence has not changed, this organization currently has the role of preventing Germany's fascist challenge. In a certain sense, it temporarily has the value of existence. If you don't see this point and shout to overthrow the League of Nations at this time, it is tantamount to helping the German National Socialist Party and accelerating the outbreak of imperialist war. For example, now that the Austrian Socialist Party has failed, it is completely wrong to see it as the political stability of the Austrian bourgeoisie. The failure of the Socialist Party naturally has its objective reasons. The main reason is that its political program cannot win the support of the masses. Although a large number of people participated in this bloodshed, the leadership could not be unified, which dispersed the power of the mass camp and did not match the government's restraining force. But has the revolution been suppressed? Not necessarily. The failure of the Socialist Party this time may have gathered the masses to unify under stronger and more correct leadership, and from then on embarked on the possibility of more tenacious hand-to-hand combat. Moreover, the occurrence of the Austrian incident is precisely due to the sharpening of the opposition between the rich and poor groups, which is a necessary phenomenon in the process of capitalist decline and cannot be said to be a victory for the dictatorship of a minority. Therefore, we can only explore its development process to understand the truth of the Austrian incident.</p>
<p>Third, we should pay attention to studying from the perspective of connections. That is to say, there is no international event in the world now that is completely unrelated to others. China's "bandit" suppression seems to be a Chinese problem that has nothing to do with others, but in fact, the British Parliament is very concerned, and countries such as the United States, France, and Japan dare not take it lightly. This is because China is everyone's market. If the market is not stable, it will affect their trade, production, labor-capital struggles, unemployment, social disorder, and even the collapse of capitalism.</p>
<p>The above are just a few principles. To correctly study international issues, you must naturally have a considerable understanding of social sciences. In particular, you should have a correct understanding of economics and historical materialism. In addition, you must be able to apply these principles to practice. This is a more difficult problem. If you don't use the methods well, you naturally can't have a correct estimate. If there are problems with the methods, it will be even more irrelevant. (Regarding this issue, there is a book in the Self-Study Series on how to self-study international issues, which will be published next month and can be used for reference. I won't go into detail here).</p>
<p>(3) A person who does not understand foreign languages can also study international issues, but the scope of research materials will be narrower. However, it is more difficult if you don't understand economics, because a researcher should at least understand the structure and dynamics of the capitalist economy, otherwise it is difficult to get started. As for how to satisfy your desires, you can only spend some time reading a few of the most basic and reliable books on economic theory, or discuss preliminary knowledge of economics with friends who understand economics!</p>
<p>4. It would take a long time to say where to start studying economics, so I'll have to talk about it when there is an opportunity. Fortunately, this department will soon publish a book on research methods for this type of book, which can be distributed. Before publication, I think you can also refer to the article "Preliminary Reading Methods of Social Sciences" published in the Reading Q&amp;A column of this newspaper on February 21, 22, and 23.</p>
<p>In addition, pay special attention to collecting research materials. The sources of information naturally come from "reading newspapers" and "reading magazines," but most newspapers and magazines have a background. You must be able to distinguish which imperialist organization a news agency is the mouthpiece of and which political position a magazine takes as its background. If you don't know the source of the material and the role of the propaganda machine, even if you have the correct research methods, it will still be useless.</p>
<p>We are very happy that you are not ashamed to ask questions, and we welcome you to write to us again to discuss any points that are unclear or unsatisfactory after reading this article. We also ask you and all readers to criticize our opinions frankly.</p>

<h3>Hunan Education Director Zhu Jingnong Talks About Hunan Education</h3>
<p>Hunan Education Director Zhu Jingnong came to Beijing a few days ago to discuss middle and primary school regulations and entrance examination regulations with the Ministry of Education and report on education matters in the province. He went to the Ministry of Education on the afternoon of the 27th and met with various officials of the Ministry to discuss matters. Because of our friendship, the reporter casually talked about education in Hunan. A brief summary is as follows: (1) There are many schools in Hunan Province. There are more than 23,000 primary schools with more than 840,000 students. There are 170 middle schools (including all levels of vocational schools) with more than 30,000 students. There is one university in Hunan for higher education with more than 500 students. The number of students in private Xiangya Medical College and Qunzhi College of Law and Politics varies from one to two hundred. (2) Education funding: universities receive more than 300,000 yuan, and the actual expenditure on education in the province is 1.8 million yuan. However, there is a lot of local education funding, which amounts to more than 9 million yuan when calculated together. (3) Vocational education: there are nine provincial vocational schools, including two senior schools (one agriculture and one industry) and seven junior schools (six male schools and one female school). There are many vocational schools run by local and private individuals, with more than 100 schools. (4) Normal education: there is one independent normal school, and six schools (three male and three female) have normal departments in middle schools. There are many rural normal schools. There are currently sixty rural normal schools in 75 counties in the province. The trend in the province is to develop joint rural normal schools as much as possible, because joint schools in several counties can concentrate talent and economy better than individual schools in each county. The three counties formerly under Yuanzhou have now been united to establish a joint rural normal school. The five counties formerly under Yuezhou are also jointly establishing a joint rural normal school, which is currently being piloted. (5) Social education: The provincial popular education center runs a popular newspaper with wide sales of tens of thousands of copies. The farmer education center runs three experimental zones: the western zone is centered on Hunan University, the southern zone is centered on Xiuye Agricultural School, and the northern zone is centered on the people's education center itself. It experiments with culture (short-term free education for adults and remedial education), agriculture (improving agriculture and introducing farmers), autonomy, sanitation, and other work. Each county has a district library, all of which have Wan You Wen Ku.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Physical Examinations for Government-Funded Students Studying Abroad Due to American Notification that Many Chinese Students Studying in the US Have Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Announcement of Measures for Physical Examinations of Government-Funded Students Studying Abroad</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved a consultation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that it had received a note from the US Embassy Office in Beijing, stating, "Recently, there have been many cases of students from various countries developing tuberculosis while studying in the United States. This disease was latent when these students applied for visas, and once it develops after entering school in the US, it often causes many difficulties and requires a lot of money. This is because those suffering from this disease do not seek immediate treatment before departing for the US. According to US law, students sent to the US by foreign governments do not need to present a physical examination certificate to obtain a government-funded student visa. However, government-funded students should undergo the same examinations as other students, with special attention paid to whether there is latent tuberculosis. The US Embassy hereby requests the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct its subordinate agencies to inform government-funded students applying for passports to the US about this matter. The relevant authorities of the US government plan to implement this measure, that all government-funded students, regardless of nationality, must undergo examinations. Students applying for visas are generally examined by doctors designated by the relevant US consular officials. For government-funded students from your country, only a written statement from a US consular official or a doctor designated by your Ministry of Education is required for recognition." In addition to notifying the various passport issuing agencies, it is appropriate to consult for reference. After approving the consultation, the Ministry of Education specially formulated five articles of measures for the physical examination of government-funded students selected by provinces and cities yesterday, and instructed all colleges and universities above junior college level, as well as the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, to comply. The order stated, "It is hereby ordered that all provinces and cities must conduct physical examinations for students selected for government-funded study abroad, as stipulated in the Ministry's regulations for studying abroad. In order to effectively implement this, five items of physical examination measures for government-funded students selected by provinces and cities have been specially formulated. When selecting government-funded students for study abroad in various countries in the future, these must be followed. In addition to distributing copies, a copy of the measures is attached for the information of the 'Departments,' 'Bureaus,' and 'Schools,' and to inform the students accordingly."</p>
<p>Attached: Measures for Physical Examination of Government-Funded Students Selected by Provinces and Cities (1) When provinces and cities hold selections for government-funded students studying abroad, they should conduct physical examinations for all candidates in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Regulations for Studying Abroad. (2) The physical examination in the preceding paragraph shall be conducted by qualified hospitals or doctors designated by the education departments and bureaus of the respective provinces and cities. The physical examination form must be signed by the hospital or doctor to be valid. (3) The education departments and bureaus of the respective provinces and cities shall submit two copies of the physical examination forms of the candidates who passed the preliminary examination, along with the documents stipulated in Article 13 of the Regulations for Studying Abroad, to the Ministry for review. (4) If the Ministry deems it necessary to re-examine the physical examination forms of the candidates who passed the preliminary examination, it may order the candidate to undergo a re-examination at a designated hospital or doctor. (5) After the Ministry has reviewed and approved the physical examination forms of all candidates, one copy will be kept by the Ministry for future reference, and the other copy will be stamped with the word "Examined" by the Ministry and issued to the candidates along with the certificate of passing the re-examination for their receipt.</p>

<h3>Letter from the General Assembly of Provincial Primary and Secondary Schools and Social Education Institutions in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>A letter from the General Assembly of Provincial Primary and Secondary Schools and Social Education Institutions in Fujian Province states: Dear Editor, I have read the education news in your newspaper on February 20, with the headline "Fujian Education Sector Demands Repayment of Old Debts from the Puppet Government, Chen Yi Believes It is an Outrageous Action" and the sub-headline "Out of Consideration, Abolish Past Years' Debts and Advance the February Expenses by Half a Month." After investigation, this does not match the facts. The situation is briefly clarified and corrected as follows:</p>
<p>When Zheng Zhenwen took over as Director of the Education Department in November of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], during Director Cheng Shimei's tenure, the education expenses were only short by half a month. Director Cheng served as the Director of Education in Fujian for four years, and the expenses owed for half a month were very limited. Director Zheng, in terms of law and reason, could not ignore the debt simply because it was owed during Cheng's tenure. As for Zheng's tenure from November of the 21st year of the Republic to November of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], he accumulated more than two months of debt. After the establishment of the puppet government, the schools maintained themselves by borrowing money, and the teachers and staff worked with empty stomachs for another two months. Therefore, including the previous debt, there were more than four months of debt in total. Even if Director Zheng ignored the efforts of the education sector and the fact that the schools borrowed money to maintain themselves during the puppet government period, what reasons would he base his decision to cancel the debts prior to November of the 22nd year of the Republic on? This is the first point. When the principals and staff representatives of the provincial schools negotiated the debts before February 8, they only asked the education authorities to be responsible for economizing expenses or to wait until the government's finances were slightly better before gradually repaying them. There was absolutely no outrageous action. This is what all social figures in Fujian saw and heard. However, Director Zheng neglected his duties. After the departmental meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, he used dangerous words to confuse the situation. Chairman Chen detained the representatives Huang Xianming and Rao Shibin at the Provincial Public Security Bureau at midnight on the 8th. Afterwards, he pushed all the responsibility onto Chairman Chen. His illegal and unreasonable, insidious and despicable actions, trampling on human rights and insulting personal dignity, are now being reported to the Ministry of Education of the National Government by all provincial schools and staff in Fujian Province, hoping to obtain the final judgment of justice and fairness. This is the second point. After Zheng Zhenwen took office as Director of the Education Department of Fujian, he often sent news reports on educational facilities to the Shanghai newspapers for publication. However, in reality, they are far from the propaganda materials.</p>
<p>Regarding the above points, please still publish them in your newspaper's education news column. Sincerely, the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, the General Assembly of Provincial Primary and Secondary Schools and Social Education Institutions in Fujian Province, February 25.</p>

<h3>Liu Fuzong Must Work Hard in the Third Sino-British Cue Sports Match</h3>
<p>Against Englishman Ge Ling at 5:30 pm</p>
<p>Yesterday Shen Lince Lost Eighteen Points</p>
<p>China Still Leads by Four Hundred and Six Points</p>
<p>In the second Sino-British International Cue Sports Competition, Shen Lince competed against Nie Keer yesterday. Shen won first but lost later. In the competition of seven hundred and fifty points, he lost eighteen points. After the two matches, China still leads by four hundred and six points. Today, in the third match, China's Liu Fuzong will compete against England's Ge Ling. The competition will begin at 5:30 pm. Both players have good skills, and the final outcome will depend on each individual's efforts.</p>
<h3>Shen Lince Leads with Excellent Skills</h3>
<p>Shen started off well, with thirty-one points on the third shot and thirty-seven points on the seventh shot. After two fluent and refreshing high scores were revealed, Shen had surpassed fifty points. By the tenth shot, Nie Keer suddenly scored fifty-one points with one hand, and the situation of both sides was balanced, fluctuating by about ten points. Based on the prediction of various shooting methods in the future, Shen, with his versatility, was more confident. Sure enough, every shot he made was successful. When it came to the fortieth shot, Shen led by a score of 457 to 353, a difference of two hundred and four points, with high scores of 21, 39, 68, 21, 21, 25, and 22. This was Shen's golden age.</p>
<h3>Nie Keer Reverses with Full Endurance</h3>
<p>The goal is seven hundred and fifty points, a huge number that cannot be reached in a short time. In addition to skills and experience, it also requires endurance as a backing. At this time, Shen gradually showed signs of fatigue and felt increasingly unsustainable. Nie Keer, however, was not like that. With full endurance, he continued to generate scores of 47, 20, 65, 50, 23, 38, and 30, reaching the goal first. Shen also scored 38, 25, 26, 24, and 24, but his energy was exhausted and he failed. In the end, he lost by a score of 732 to 750.</p>

<h3>Kaitai Cup Pharmacy Soccer Tournament</h3>
<p>| Sino-British Defeats Nationalist to Gain Right to Re-examination |</p>
<p>On the silent Chinese football field, as the morning sun had just risen, and the first light was breaking, the Sino-British Nationalist forces launched a fierce battle for over an hour before it ended. As a result, the Sino-British team won the right to re-examination with a score of three to zero. The first group, Integrated vs. Huaying, was unable to compete due to the wet ground after the snow on the 25th. According to the resolution, a make-up game has been scheduled for March 11th.</p>

<h3>The 6th Nanjing Basketball Tournament is About to Begin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing News) The Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Public Stadium has consistently achieved remarkable results in hosting various sports competitions over the years. In recent years, social sports in Nanjing have been thriving, thanks to the stadium's efforts in promoting them. The citywide basketball championship has been held since the spring of the 17th year of the Republic, with a history of five or six years. Now, for the sixth edition, the stadium has recently revised its regulations and sent letters to various places to solicit members. It is learned that registration has already begun on the 24th of this month and will close on the 5th of next month. The competition will begin on the 10th and is expected to conclude by the end of March. Nanjing is a region with a concentration of talent, and there is no shortage of strong teams. It is hoped that they can participate in a timely manner and contribute to the grand event.</p>
<h3>The Municipal No. 1 Stadium Revises the Regulations for the Amateur Basketball Association</h3>
<p>The fourth amateur basketball competition organized by the Municipal No. 1 Stadium will begin registration on March 3rd. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The newly drafted regulations of the association are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  The purpose of this association is to promote amateur sports among industrial and commercial circles, strengthen physical fitness, and improve skills.</p>
<p>2.  This association will hire three committee members to manage the association's affairs.</p>
<p>3.  All amateur basketball teams from industrial and commercial circles can join this association, but the teams must not include students or physical education teachers (the qualification restrictions are detailed in the amateur qualification regulations for various competitions at this stadium). If this is violated, once discovered, the team's competition qualification will be immediately revoked, and they will never be allowed to participate in any competitions at this stadium.</p>
<p>4.  Each team is limited to twelve players, and each person is only allowed to join one team. The joining procedures are detailed in the registration form.</p>
<p>5.  Once a team is registered, they cannot change players or increase or decrease the number of people. When registering, a six-inch photo of all team members must be submitted. Those without photos or with photos without names will not be allowed to participate in the competition.</p>
<p>6.  Registration will be from March 3rd to March 25th.</p>
<p>7.  The competition rules will be implemented according to the latest rules of the Chinese National Sports Association.</p>
<p>8.  The competition location will be the outdoor basketball court at this stadium. The balls used for the competition will be provided by the association. The referees for the competition will be hired by the association. The competition dates and times will be scheduled by the association.</p>
<p>9.  Teams that are more than ten minutes late for the scheduled competition time will be considered to have forfeited. If both teams are not present, both will be considered to have forfeited. A team that forfeits twice will have its competition qualification revoked. Once the competition qualification is revoked, all previous competitions will also be considered invalid.</p>
<p>10. The competition dates are set for Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday. Each team must arrive at the stadium on time according to the schedule arranged by this association and must not be late. Whether or not there will be a postponement due to rain can be inquired by calling Zhang Longhai at 21089 in Nanshi. If a team has a special reason and wants to reschedule the competition, they must first obtain the consent of the opposing team and jointly submit a letter to the association two days in advance. It will only be effective after being approved by the association.</p>
<p>11. The competition method will be a single round-robin system (if there are many teams, they will be divided into groups according to their skill level, and each group will hold a single round-robin competition). The winner gets one point, and the loser gets zero points. After the round-robin is over, if two teams have the same score, a tie-breaker will be held. If three or more teams have the same score, the knockout competition method will be used to determine the championship.</p>
<p>12. If a team or player is reported or discovered by an association staff member to have violated the competition rules, and after investigation it is confirmed, the result of that competition will be considered a failure, regardless of the outcome. In severe cases, the entire team's competition qualification will be revoked. The same penalties apply to those who exhibit barbaric behavior during the competition and refuse to obey the referee's decisions.</p>
<p>13. Players without numbers on their jerseys will not be allowed to play.</p>
<p>14. Teams must not protest on the spot during the competition or suspend the competition for any reason. The protest letter should be submitted to the committee of this association within two days after the fact. Whether the reasons for the protest are sufficient will be notified by this association in writing, but the decision of the committee is the final judgment, and the protesting team may not object again.</p>
<p>15. These regulations are valid from the start of registration to the end date. If there are any unaddressed matters, they may be proposed for amendment by the committee.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Spring Snow</h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>I remember the old saying: "It's hard to be the sky in April, needing both warmth and cold." Because the weather in April is when the wheat ears are growing, requiring coldness, while it's also the silkworm raising season, and silkworms need warmth. If it's suitable for the wheat, it harms the silkworms; if you protect the silkworms, you sacrifice the wheat. You can't have both, so it's really not easy being the sky god in April!</p>
<p>It's still early spring now, not yet April, so it seems being the sky wouldn't be difficult, but in fact, it's not easy either. Because in this February weather, a great spring chill suddenly brews, and in some places, it even snows heavily. Spring chill is a common thing, as the saying goes, "Spring chill freezes old yellow cows to death." The old saying "On the eighth day of the second month, the birthday of Emperor Zhang, eat frozen dog meat" doesn't it all show the harm of spring chill? But it's okay if it doesn't snow, once it snows, trouble comes.</p>
<p>The thing about snow is that it has to fall at the right time, appropriately. Snow falling in the twelfth month is called "winter snow," and it's beneficial without harm, the heavier the better. Pests in the fields all freeze to death, and next year's farming will be smooth, a sign of a bountiful year. That's "auspicious snow." Once spring arrives, if it snows, it's called "spring snow." Spring snow harms spring crops, and is detrimental to farmland. So this time, the sky, by snowing in the spring, has earned many complaints from farmers.</p>
<p>It's said that last year the weather was favorable, the harvests were abundant, yet the rural villages went bankrupt, and the farmers cried in bitterness. The sky god didn't offer relief, but instead sent snow that harmed the crops. If this year is struck with disaster, and the fields are desolate, that would be unthinkable. So the spring snow shows the sky's lack of consideration, the sky's lack of sensitivity. Anything that lacks consideration and sensitivity, whether it's people or the sky, deserves to be scolded. It's only right.</p>
<p>Don't just talk about snow, it needs to fall appropriately; the same goes for rain. If it falls at the right time, it's "timely rain." Rain after a long drought is even called "sweet dew." Conversely, if it doesn't fall at the right time, it's either "torrential rain" or "downpour." I hope the sky god will realize its mistake, atone for its crimes, and send down "sweet rain" to make up for the transgression of the "spring snow." May torrential rain not come, may downpours not be seen, benefiting farming and bestowing kindness on the common people. I know those who blamed the sky will surely praise it, those who hated the sky will surely be grateful to it.</p>
<p>Being the sky is hard, but being human is even harder. Everything you do must be without resentment from others; every word and action must be praised by others. Where virtue reaches, where does hate come from? It also lies in seeking what is suitable for the time, and bestowing kindness on the masses.</p>
<h3>The Old Professor</h3>
<p>— Shou Cheng</p>
<p>The old professor pushed up the thick glasses that were about to fall off his nose, and shouted in a hoarse voice. The veins on his neck were bulging tightly, and the sparse, gray-yellow beard around his lips twitched as his mouth opened and closed.</p>
<p>The tense emotions of the entire classroom of young people were focused on his waving, shaking fingers｜｜This place was filled with his lifelong dedication, passion, and high hopes. He explained painstakingly, once, twice, repeating tirelessly. Ignoring his own hoarseness, regardless of his own exhaustion, his only wish was that no student would be willing to be vague about understanding anything.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he caught sight of students whispering or gazing idly out the window. Then he would be furious, calling them good-for-nothings and blockheads, stamping his feet and scolding loudly. But not long after, he would approach the classmates he had just reprimanded, stroking their soft hair with his thin, withered hand, warning them with kindness and sincerity: Child, don't hate me. It's for your future that I scold you!</p>
<p>Each time, when he finished teaching a section, he would always lean close to the students, asking with sincere hope: Do you understand? Do you understand? Only when everyone nodded, indicating a clear understanding of everything he had taught, would he smile with satisfaction. But in the end, he would still declare: Don't deceive me! This is easy to understand, as long as you are willing to put your heart into it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would happily boast about his knowledge and experience, but after a while, he would change his tone and say: I'm old, useless now! You are young, work hard! I hope that each of you will be stronger than this old man in the future!</p>
<p>Whether in bitter cold or sweltering heat, even when afflicted with illness, he always brought his briefcase to school to teach. Once, a classmate said to him: Sir, you are not in good health, you should rest for a while! But he replied: I have the great responsibility of shaping young people, how dare I be absent arbitrarily! If I neglect your studies, how can I face the expectations of your parents!</p>
<p>His sleeves were always covered with white chalk dust, and the cover of the obscure and worn book he carried under his arm had long lost its vibrant colors; but the spirit of our old professor is forever as strong as the sun!</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhao Tingfang</p>
<p>Mr. S. lectured on Chinese language and literature, lecturing on Guo Moruo's new poem ｜｜｜"The universe after the rain, like a conscience washed by tears." He suddenly raged: "What kind of talk is this? Utterly ridiculous! Tears are in the eyes, the heart is in the belly, separated by a layer of skin, how can they be connected together? Truly absurd! Ha! Tears can even wash the heart!"</p>

<p>When I was a child, the teacher in the private school taught couplets. I was naturally mischievous, so he often gave me difficult problems to solve. If I didn't do well, he would surely beat me. One day, he gave me a five-character couplet: "People love fat hen." I thought for a long time. Although I could barely come up with an answer, I didn't dare to say it. I couldn't help but laugh and cry. When it was time to dismiss in the evening, he called me over and scolded: "Mischievous thing!" Is this little thing so hard to answer? You can answer with "I follow the fat woman"!" I couldn't help but burst out laughing, spraying snot on the teacher's desk. The teacher also smiled slightly and said, "Go!"</p>

<p>Many new novelists flaunt themselves as symbolic, romantic, realistic, etc., to show that they have something to follow. The most popular now is the realistic school, but I always feel that there is still some affectation. It is far inferior to the New Year couplet on the door of a thatched cottage at the foot of Dongshan Mountain in my hometown three years ago, which I passed on my way to worship at the ancestral graves: "Spring flowers, spring wine, spring wealth; Winter chicken, winter leg, winter sausage," which is more interesting for being realistic!</p>

<h3>Love Notes</h3>
<p>— Mu Zeqing</p>
<p>Love is like a non-term check; whether it can be cashed depends on the person's skill.</p>
<p>After the sweetness of being in love is produced, hesitation and terror come!</p>
<p>The first love of a smart person is secret; he is afraid that people will laugh at him for taking a blank check. The love of an ordinary person is public; he is deeply afraid that others will not know his luck.</p>
<p>The love of an old-fashioned woman is like a quiet lake, without tides. The love of a new-fashioned woman is like the price of bidding for gold, which often fluctuates.</p>
<p>In first love, one always wants to possess the other person. After possession, one wants to relax.</p>
<p>A family letter is worth ten thousand gold; a love letter is worth even more.</p>
<p>A woman does not like to love a writer; she is afraid of being used as material after a broken relationship.</p>
<p>When a woman and a man reach a passionate love, when they are close to the focus of love, she does not admit that she "loves" the man; she only admits that she is "fond" of him.</p>
<p>People in love have five illnesses: lovesickness, depression, neurosis, kidney disease, insomnia.</p>
<p>Marriage is love heading towards the grave; leaving is the same. Heaven brews the taste of sorrow into love, and starting again is a discount.</p>
<p>Between spiritual love and physical love, there is only a layer of mysterious thin paper; once broken, it is worthless.</p>
<p>Some people think that "love at first sight" is an emotional impulse, just a temporary game for both parties. However, the love that is completed by following the process of love, the foundation of which is also half built on sand.</p>
<p>For the sake of testing, a woman always looks for opportunities to torment a man. Sometimes the man feels more pain and more pleasure, and sometimes he feels unbearable. If a man can overcome or overcome the woman's temptations and torments, the woman can love him more wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>When a man and a woman cuddle, they only hate that time passes too quickly.</p>
<p>A lovesick person is praised by old-fashioned women, but new-fashioned women only find it pitiful and ridiculous.</p>
<p>A man with love experience is afraid of a woman with experience; both are veterans, and there is no true love and fun to be found. Women have the same mentality.</p>
<p>The "joy of love" at the first meeting has complicated thoughts; after the thoughts of respect and love, what remains is only "pity"!</p>

<p>Zi Qiang looked at his watch. Another ten minutes had passed. He said to Zhao Weng, "Do you have anything else to say?" Zhao Weng said, "I said everything I had to say yesterday. There's nothing more to say. Take care of yourself in everything." Jiang interjected from the side, "That's right, you must take care of yourself in everything." Zi Qiang didn't say anything. He took out his watch again to look at it. Zhao Weng said, "Have Xiao Lin come and carry your luggage with you. You go to the bus station first and wait. We'll all see you off to the station." Zi Qiang laughed, "How dare I accept that both of you old people see me off? It's fine if Gui Zhi sees me off." Zhao Weng was always considerate of his son. Since he said to let his beloved wife see him off alone, there might be another reason behind it. So he looked at Jiang and said, "It's okay if we don't see him off." Jiang never even said that she wanted to see him off. Zhao Weng said this, so naturally she accepted what she didn't agree to. Zi Qiang stood in the middle of the hall for a while, turned his head and looked into the courtyard twice, and still stopped. Gui Zhi saw that he wanted to leave but didn't want to, so she said, "It's still a few steps to the bus station, let's go first." So Zi Qiang called Zhao Weng "Dad" and Jiang "Old Lady," and then said "I'm leaving." He took off his hat, bowed deeply twice, put on his hat, suddenly stood at attention, turned around, and immediately took large steps, and walked out. As he walked, he didn't turn his head to look. He only heard the sound of leather shoes ringing, ringing all the way out the door. Xiao Lin carried the suitcase and bag, following behind. Gui Zhi quickly rushed forward, closely following behind him. Zi Qiang walked very quickly. When he reached the outside of the gate, his steps stopped. He said to Gui Zhi, "Did the two old people say anything?" Before Gui Zhi could answer him, someone called out from behind, "Zi Qiang, as soon as you get to the camp, write me a letter right away!"

<h3>A Record of the Manila Carnival</h3>
<p>— Yan Wenchou</p>
<p>For more than twenty years, the annual Carnival has seemed to bore the world. However, the Philippine government has repeatedly tried its best to promote it. One reason is that in this period of commercial decline, Manila, as the capital of the Philippines, can be embellished by this event. Visitors from all directions gather, and the market turns to be lively, just like taking a shot of stimulant, which can awaken the spirit. The other reason is that the citizens work hard all year round, suffer from the heat in the summer and the wetness in the rainy season, and this grand meeting in early spring serves as a spiritual adjustment, making women and children feel more energetic. And this year's Carnival has a more memorable value for our overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The most attractive aspect of this grand event is the election of the Philippine Lady (i.e., the Flower Queen). For these twenty years, the old system of a few years ago has been restored. The right to the first election rests with the newspapers and magazines that have been registered, and the right to the second election rests with the shareholders. (Each share is ten yuan, and the association gives a beautiful badge, exempting the purchase of admission tickets, and has the right to enter the Grand Auditorium for five nights to watch various performances and dance.) More than ten years ago, the daughter of the Philippine Governor Harrison intended to be the successor to this imperial crown. As a result, there were many contestants, and the host compromised by dividing the crown into two queens, East and West, ruling in parallel. It can be seen that the glory of this sixteen-night throne is not easily obtained by ordinary young ladies. Unexpectedly, this year, a Chinese woman received the most votes for Philippine Lady. This is an unprecedented record for the Chinese Association, and a groundbreaking event in the overseas Chinese community. It is learned that the lady is the daughter of overseas Chinese merchant Chen Erheng, a student of the Music Department of the National University. Mr. Chen has many contacts in Philippine political circles, and his friends campaigned in many ways, which led to good results.</p>
<p>The entire meeting opened for sixteen nights, with four major parades. The first was a general parade, which could be joined by all agencies, societies, and shops, either in groups or with decorated floats. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce decorated a float depicting China thirty years ago and the two phenomena of China over the past thirty years. The judges announced that it won the first prize for its profound meaning. The second was an educational parade, and the scout troops from various overseas Chinese schools also participated. The float decorated by the China Zhizhi Education Association was at the end, and its intention was that the universal principles of the world are oppressed by airplanes and cannons, and the distance between the god of peace and the earth is still far away. The judges decided that it won the second prize for its gorgeous decoration. This can be said to be scratching where it doesn't itch.</p>
<p>Every night in the Grand Auditorium, the program is changed. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month at 4:00, it was Children's Day, and overseas Chinese schools from various countries were invited to join. The order of their performances was determined by lottery. First, there were more than two hundred female students from Japanese schools, wearing short clothes and blue skirts, standing in three concentric circles, performing the national flag dance, and their steps and music were very harmonious. The second was more than a hundred Filipino boys and girls, performing the pursuit of young men and women, performing various new-style dances. The third was Spanish boys and girls performing the ancient Three Princes fighting the bull, watching them after their victory, watching the men and women sing and dance happily. The fourth was our Qiao Girls' School performing Mulan joining the army. Due to time constraints (limited to twenty minutes), only Mulan General in ancient palace costume was performed, leading the soldiers in person to the front lines, with the shadows of swords and the light of knives, dancing gracefully. The fifth was American children playing villagers, surrounded by Red Indians, the whole family was wiped out, and the young girl was plundered by the Red Enemy, and the change of costumes did not indicate the ending. Overall, although the performances of various countries are rudimentary, each shows the national character. Japan has a military smell; Filipinos do not shed their pursuit of color; Spain still has a lot of religious color; and our country is antique. There were seven judges for the Miss Beauty election, four were female leaders, and three were the wives of the consuls of the West, China, and Japan. After the closing ceremony, it was announced that China won the first prize and Japan won the second prize. The judges' comments were that the costumes were elegant and symbolic, and promoted Eastern women's rights.</p>

<h3>The Two Major Crises Facing the National Goods Industry</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that our country is a country with backward production, so the ratio of production to consumption is only two to five. The phenomenon of "supply falling short of demand" has naturally created a trend of increasing reliance on foreign goods in recent years. We see that the countryside is bankrupt, and handicrafts are inevitably being eliminated by natural selection. Now, what we urgently need is to hope for the flourishing of domestic production enterprises, hoping to slightly make up for our own deficiencies and reverse the past decline. However, the painful reality shatters our ardent hopes. The so-called emerging industries are still fraught with difficulties. Looking around in the vast darkness, the future is full of thorns. The progress and stagnation of these industries can be imagined. Moreover, upon careful examination of their internal contradictions and conflicts, the various adverse phenomena are actually only going backward. To speak only of the current situation, there are two major crises facing the national goods industry. If these crises are not quickly avoided and continue, then they could prove fatal to national goods manufacturers.</p>
<p>(1) The Seriousness of Cutthroat Competition Among Companies in the Same Industry. People often call this a characteristic of Chinese people, but I say, let us rather call it the cause of a deadly ailment of Chinese people. Because of the manifestation of this inferior national character, I can categorically assert that it is the biggest obstacle to the progress of national goods. Often, a company's products and reputation are well-received and welcomed by society, but occasionally, because of the price reduction by one or two new factories, it is enough to ignite the fuse for the entire industry to trample on itself. All sorts of price wars, the manufacturing of inferior goods, and the clamor of "secondary brands" and "special prices" disturb the market. In severe cases, they violate the articles of association of trade associations, overturn previous resolutions, and commit outrageous actions, without end. And in the end, they inevitably resort to cutting corners and reducing materials due to cost concerns. As a result, society loses faith, gradually eliminates them, and they become beyond salvation.</p>
<p>(2) The Intensification of Foreign Goods Dumping. Imperialists, seeing the deepening of the world economic panic and the inability to overcome the crisis, with the market becoming increasingly narrow, overproduction, and rising unemployment, are trying as much as possible to shift the crisis losses to China within a possible range. Their dumping policies are becoming more and more severe, especially Japan, this ruthless demon. Recently, it has even combined government and business, using organized and planned strategies to carry out large-scale dumping. Not to mention other things, just the 2 million stones of Japanese rice transported to China, as reported the other day, is naturally enough to frighten us, who claim to "build the country on agriculture."</p>
<h3>Exposing Mirror</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of headless light bulbs and wireless radios circulating on the market have been surprisingly low. In fact, most of them are Japanese goods. Sellers, with a conscience that has been obliterated, seek only profit. Purchasers, if they have any spirit, should be strictly cautious and must not, for the sake of the thought of "cheapness," harm the country and the people.</p>
<p>A customer who had business with customs officials came to say that customs officials recently discovered dozens of boxes of pencils unloaded at the Huishan Wharf, undoubtedly suspected of being Japanese goods. However, after opening them, they were found to be Dahua pencils. It was difficult to distinguish them from the original brand. The doubt in this case has not yet been clarified. He asked me to investigate it. Unfortunately, the Dahua factory is located in Hong Kong, and it is not known how it is. It can be seen how difficult it is to choose and purchase supplies.</p>
<p>A friend of mine purchased a Parker fountain pen at a certain place, but found it to be of poor quality after using it. He happened to meet a friend who said that it was a counterfeit pen made in Japan, with a price less than one-sixth of that of a Parker fountain pen, and the form and wording were difficult to distinguish. My friend rushed to consult An Nuo, the commercial counselor, who also strongly stated that it was a counterfeit. My friend was extremely indignant that he had obtained a counterfeit product at a high price and told the seller and the purchaser that they should pay close attention in the future. If discernment is unclear, it is still more reliable to trust domestic goods companies.</p>
<p>Amidst wind and rain, and with crises lurking everywhere, the future of our national goods is indeed not promising. At this critical moment, when disaster is imminent, how will those who advocate national goods deliberate on the situation, exhaust their wisdom, and strive to open up this serious situation and reverse the already collapsing tide?</p>
<h3>The Patriotism of a Female Servant</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiaoyang</p>
<p>Zhang Ma labored diligently for a whole month and received four dollars in wages. She happily went to a certain road to buy some clothing material for the cold winter.</p>
<p>After buying it back, she proudly showed it to her mistress!</p>
<p>"Madam, I got a bargain! This clothing material only costs six cents a foot, and the pattern is not bad!"</p>
<p>It happened that Qian Jie saw it! She immediately discovered the traces on the clothing material!</p>
<p>"Zhang Ma! You bought foreign goods! That's why the price is so cheap. Look! Isn't there a very clear (Made in Japan) label stuck on the edge of this clothing material?"</p>
<p>Qian Jie's eyesight is indeed much better! "What? I clearly bought it in the XX store!" Zhang Ma was somewhat suspicious. She carefully looked at the clothing material and felt that the weaving was very simple.</p>
<p>"That's right, you've been tricked! Let me tell you! These kinds of shops specialize in this kind of speculative business. On the surface, they loudly promote national goods, but in reality, they are constantly importing enemy goods! It's really heartbreaking to talk about!"</p>
<p>Qian Jie explained to her in a torrent of words.</p>
<p>"Ah! Miss, I don't want to make this clothing material! But it's a bit wasteful to throw it away, so I'll just use it as a diaper for Xiao Bao! Alas! These unscrupulous merchants who disregard shame will eventually fail one day!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ma's full of patriotism aroused Fu Jie's infinite gratitude. Then, Qian Jie accompanied her to a nearby national goods store to buy some domestically produced Free Ni clothing material. Although the price was relatively more expensive, the quality was extremely strong!</p>
<p>I think, a female servant who is illiterate actually has such a sincere patriotism, which makes me feel extremely admired and respectful. I wonder what several modern ladies would think when they heard this!</p>
<h3>Who is Right and Who is Wrong?</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Everyone knows: Facts are the most eloquent! He and his patriotic female student wife always felt that their married life was disharmonious! He is a modern Western-dressed young man, and she is a patriotic woman who does not like to dress up and loves thrift.</p>
<p>He mistakenly believed that girls in the city are invariably fond of vanity and extravagance! When they were first married, in order to please his wife, he always bought imported cosmetics as tribute when he came back from work! He smiled at his wife and said:</p>
<p>"My Love. Do you like this?" She did not step forward, nor did she pay attention. A wisp of her heart……was thinking, "Why do Chinese young men have to be so shameless｜to flatter foreigners? No, maybe he is manipulating the domesticating power of women! Alas!"</p>
<p>After a while, she said solemnly to her husband:</p>
<p>"Chinese people, please speak Chinese! Chinese people, please use Chinese goods. This degenerate thing! Please... give it to the modern girl you love!"</p>
<p>When he heard this, he couldn't help but feel anger rising from his heart. "Thinking that this woman is too unappreciative, not only can't she get sweet happiness in the early days of her marriage, but she is suffering from a burst of anger that has nowhere to vent! Their goals are different, their paths are incompatible, damn it! He decided to divorce her, see how she is?" He left resentfully｜She also felt bored｜Sad that she had married the wrong person｜So she went back to her parents' home. After a few days, the two sides were indeed involved in a lawsuit｜It was his initiative to ask the judge to allow the divorce. The judge summoned her to inquire about the facts of the dispute. She stated it eloquently, and finally｜Also said, who is right and who is wrong? There is public opinion! It happened that this judge was a believer in using domestic goods, and he had received an order from the Ministry of Justice to strictly enforce the use of domestic goods, with clear provisions for punishment for those who violated it! After hearing her statement, the judge couldn't help but feel anger rising from his heart, and slammed the table and scolded him, shameless! Scolding him for being a running dog of imperialists and a running dog of unscrupulous merchants! He was sentenced to a crime of "abandoning his wife to curry favor with foreigners!" He had to be imprisoned, and he repented and thought: I didn't expect women to have such magic power! I shouldn't have been so rash..." His wife, seeing that he had a look of repentance, strongly pleaded with the judge to forgive him. The judge agreed! He followed her home in fear and very respectfully!</p>
<h3>Several Things Women Should Do During the Women's National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>This year is the Women's National Goods Year. How important is the responsibility that women bear for promoting national goods? Now I put aside all empty talk and only talk about a few things that women in general should do this year.</p>
<p>(1) Regardless of the needs of clothing, food, and housing, make up your mind not to use foreign goods, but only to use domestic goods. Saving one penny on foreign goods is to recover one penny of rights and interests for the country. Beware of saying one thing and doing another, saying that you are promoting national goods on your lips, but in reality, you are a big customer of foreign goods.</p>
<p>(2) Persuade your husband not to use foreign goods. If your husband likes to use foreign goods, you should advise him sternly not to use foreign goods anymore.</p>
<p>(3) If you already have children, then their daily necessities, such as clothes and toys, must not be purchased from foreign goods, and all should be purchased from domestic goods.</p>
<p>(4) Advise relatives and friends to use domestic goods.</p>
<p>What I have said above may be clichés, but if everyone can do so, the effect will definitely be great.</p>
<p>Contribution</p>
<h3>Rising Silver Prices and Alarming Trade Deficit Figures</h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>Recently, the Jianghai Customs released the international trade situation in this city in January of this year. The trade deficit reached more than 40 million yuan, an unprecedented increase in recent years. Observing the future, there is still a trend of continued surge.</p>
<p>Alarming, this amount of trade deficit is truly enough to control the lives of the Chinese people and plunge them into an abyss of no return. I have tried to investigate the reason, and the main problem lies in the increase in the price of silver in various countries around the world. Since the price of silver is high, it is tantamount to lowering the gold coins of gold-using countries, and the market price of goods in their countries feels even more worthwhile for dumping abroad. China, as a silver-using country, is precisely the most suitable market for various countries to sell goods, and the arrival of foreign goods is like a tide, unstoppable. After this increase, goods abroad are of course worthwhile to import, encroaching on the sales of domestic goods, and the price of domestic goods is implicitly reduced, making it even more difficult to support. This is even more related to the life and death of the future of national goods. Although the alarming trade deficit in January is due to more than one reason, the gift of rising silver prices cannot be denied. In addition, the Chinese people have short-sighted vision and are heavily self-interested, risking impropriety, purchasing Japanese goods and pretending to be domestic goods, and there is no shortage of people who do so. There are even more people who focus on private interests and consider selling Japanese goods as a good plan, regardless of the overall situation. The lack of conscience of people, the shamelessness of people, has reached this point, which is even more painful. We, bearing life and carrying spirit, while one breath still exists, should uphold this conscience to illuminate the treacherous, and also wish patriotic people to rise up together in this Women's National Goods Year to save rights and interests. And the silver price issue should also be thoroughly studied, and jointly seek relief.</p>
<p>Family Talk</p>
<h3>Women's National Goods Year and Family Handicrafts</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>A national goods year has passed, and a women's national goods year has followed. In short, national goods still need to be promoted and manufactured. However, if we look at the national goods factories that have been established, how many are there? Their achievements are already rare! And their capabilities are still insufficient! This is also a matter of fact. Originally, to run a factory perfectly, in addition to huge capital, all aspects such as work management, material allocation, and labor disputes should be paid attention to, and the problem of difficult management, especially in today's China where capital and talent are lacking, feels even more difficult to run a large factory. So, what to do? Just because it's difficult, don't do it? No, in this era of transition from agriculture to industry, since we cannot completely run large factories, then let everyone promote family handicrafts to help the common people and alleviate the urgent need. In this way, in addition to a part of heavy industry being operated by the state, the rest can not require large-scale industry, and can be carried out in the people's homes as units. The capital to run this can be hundreds of yuan, or thousands of yuan. The gathering can be four or five families, or ten or twenty families. If this is the case, I think that farmers living in the unfortunate times of frequent natural disasters may also be able to alleviate their difficulties by engaging in industry in their spare time. It is not known that in addition to promoting national goods, it also solves a part of the rural economy, which is truly achieving two things with one effort.</p>
<p>Isn't there domestically produced woollen goods being manufactured in North China? Those large quantities of woollen goods are not made in coal-burning factories, but are the work results of North China farmers in their spare time. The initiators of this cause were the personnel of the YMCA. Originally, a countless amount of wool was discarded every year in North China, which was an extremely regrettable waste, but since there were no factories, there was no way out without discarding it. The YMCA, seeing this, went to England, the most advanced country in the textile industry, and brought back their simple manual machinery that farmers used to weave wool hundreds of years ago, slightly improved it, and asked carpenters to imitate it, and set up schools to train and teach talents, one to ten, ten to hundreds, and went deep into farmers' families in separate groups, so that rural women could use waste materials and spare time to weave articles. Someone may say high-sounding things like being backward about this kind of old equipment for ten families, but I think this is not shameful, but is a method that is very practicable for China at present. Now the results in North China are like this, as long as you understand it, you will definitely issue a criticism and thought of "Good! Not bad! This is a way!" Since the fact is like this, then all parts of the country can continue to work hard and promote family handicrafts together, which is also the best policy.</p>
<p>The importance of family handicrafts and the need to promote them are as described above, and in this year's so-called women's national goods, promoting family handicrafts is even more timely, because women are the center of gravity of the family, especially in modern China, when women's careers are in a slump, some stay at home, it is better to find another way out, relying on each person's financial resources and abilities, separately or jointly, to run family handicrafts, which seems to be more cost-effective and appropriate. This does not mean that family industry does not need men. In fact, for girls to struggle for equal status, this is truly an extremely flat avenue, and women engaged in family industry can also take care of the responsibilities of housewives in the family at any time, without worrying about him, and can boldly do it. Dear female compatriots: Those of you who see this page of the newspaper are probably intellectual classes who have graduated or studied at some school. Please accept the reporter's intention and transfer the spirit and money you spend on makeup, gambling, or other entertainment every day to the path of engaging in family industry. I think you can receive better happiness than now. This is indeed a major plan that benefits both the public and private and saves the country and the people. Remember! Work hard! Look at this period of the Women's National Goods Year and let the women and the national border release a different light!</p>

<p>Voice of the Telecom World</p>
<h3>Telegraph and Roads (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Although telegraphs are transmitted very quickly, traveling thousands of miles in an instant, there are times when they are somewhat delayed. The reasons for this delay are not just one. If the sender and receiver ask the office counter once, they can fully understand. Now, if someone drives to a certain place and the road in the middle is under repair, temporarily stopping vehicles from coming and going, they have to take a detour to reach their destination. Therefore, the original 15 minutes to reach the destination must be increased by 5 minutes due to the detour. This is a fact that is difficult to avoid, and can also be used as evidence for telegraphs. For example, the Shanghai-Xun (Jiujiang) direct line, occasionally due to disasters that damage the line, one side is repairing it quickly, and at the same time, the transmission of telegraphs cannot but make it slightly delayed. At this time, if the Shanghai-Hankou and Hankou-Xun lines are open, then change to sending to Hankou, and then transfer to Jiujiang. All these dispatches are not uniform. All can be regarded as detours; the time delayed is the time of the detour, and the time spent is very temporary because the circuits are interconnected like blood vessels.</p>
<p>There is usually the so-called "line congestion." This term is also frequently seen in newspapers reporting telegraph news. In fact, line congestion is telegraph congestion. Why does telegraph congestion occur? It can be said that most of it is related to the current situation. When the situation is tense, the telegraphs of the government and army come in droves. Their nature is extremely important and confidential. According to the rules, they should be sent in advance. This is like encountering a fire engine whizzing past on the road, and you have to give way and let it pass first. Also, with so many government and army telegraphs, it is like a transportation hub, with trams, cars, and human-powered vehicles gathered in one place. Drivers must follow the order of priority and cannot arbitrarily increase their speed.</p>
<p>There is also another level, which is the inspection of telegraphs. Usually, telegraphs are not inspected. After simple business procedures, they are sent separately, which is extremely fast. If there is a change in the situation, the military authorities will have an inspection of telegraphs. Once a telegraph is inspected, some inspection time is added in addition to the sending time. During martial law, vehicles passing through are also often stopped everywhere for inspection. If you ask again and again, can the vehicle arrive at the time set in peacetime? The telegraph and the driving car can be equated.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that there are many similarities between road traffic and telegraph traffic; only because road traffic is seen by all, and delays or accidents in driving are considered natural, there is nothing to be surprised about. As for sending telegrams, the transmission situation in the bureau, once exposed, is no different. Those who are clear about roads may not be clear about telegrams. This is because the content of telecommunications has not been announced, and external accusations cannot be avoided. This article of mine may be considered to be defending the people serving in the telecommunications industry. In fact, there are many facts to prove this phenomenon. There is no shortage of enlightened people in all circles. If an investigation is conducted (investigations are very welcome), they will know that the telegraph itself is accurate and fast. Occasionally, there are delays, which are due to various reasons.</p>
<h3>"Send a Telegram to Beiping"</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>Reading a report in a Shanghai newspaper, I learned that in the seventh volume of the natural science textbook published by the Great Eastern Book Bureau, there is a lesson called "Send a Telegram to Beiping." The main idea of the content is: "To send a telegram from Shanghai to Beiping, it must be transferred through the Nanjing and Tianjin telegraph bureaus, and it can arrive in one or two days." The Shanghai-Ping telegram must be transferred by Beijing, and it takes another one or two days. Those who have a little telecommunications knowledge cannot help but be horrified when they read it. The author's pen is simply an "amazing pen"!</p>
<p>In fact, this writer, if he must do this lesson "Send a Telegram to Beiping" and is afraid of paying the newspaper fee, may as well take the trouble to go to the telegraph bureau or wireless radio station inquiry office for an inquiry. Building a car behind closed doors can also fit the rut when opening the door. Of course, it will not lead to inaccurate compilation and major mistakes.</p>
<p>However, I have to say again that the writers of textbooks can generally be said to be members of the intellectual class in society, but they have not been able to fully understand telecommunications common sense, so it is even more conceivable for those who are not intellectual class. Therefore, instilling common knowledge of telegraph, telephone, and wireless radio so that everyone can understand and use them is really an "urgent matter."</p>
<h3>Establishment of Wired Telegraph Lines in the Past Year (Part 1) by Qian Jiaguang</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>5,371 kilometers of main and branch lines have been repaired.</p>
<p>2,104 kilometers of new lines have been added.</p>
<p>1,093 kilometers of lines have been added to existing poles.</p>
<p>One new underwater cable has been added. Six underwater cables have been repaired and opened. The remaining 22 major sections are currently under repair and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Wired telegraphs have been in China for over fifty years, with a total length of over 100,000 kilometers. Although this is relatively small compared to our area, it is still lagging behind other countries. However, since its inception, it has been affected by politics, local disturbances, and financial difficulties. The establishment of these lines has been severely impacted, which cannot be fully described in a short article. As for the existing lines, they are divided into main lines (幹綫) and branch lines (支綫). Main lines have more communication traffic, so the number of wires is usually greater than that of branch lines. This is also a kind of distinction. The main lines controlled include Hanping (Hankou to Beiping), Huhan (Shanghai to Hankou), Hufu (Shanghai to Fuzhou), Fuguang (Fuzhou to Guangzhou), Jinpu (Tianjin to Pukou), Hanyu (Hankou to Chongqing), Qinghu (Qingdao to Shanghai), Yanji (Yantai to Jinan), Pingqia (Beiping to Qiaqitu), Beining (Beiping to Liaoning), Liaoha (Liaoning to Harbin), Hahei (Harbin to Heihe), Pinglan (Beiping to Lanzhou), Jiuguang (Jiujiang to Guangzhou), Guangyong (Guangzhou to Nanning), Wugui (Wuchang to Guilin), Guinan (Guilin to Nanguan), Changbi (Changsha to Bijie), Xilu (Xi'an to Luzhou), Yudian (Chongqing to Yunnan), Yunxin (Yunnan to Xiaoxinjie), Yunlong (Yunnan to Longzhou), etc. Currently, main line engineering offices have been established in these locations, specifically for maintenance. These include Hanping, Huhan, Hufu, Fuguang, Jinpu, Hanyu, Qinghu, Yanji, Pingqia, and Guangyong. In addition, communication links established between various provinces and cities are generally referred to as branch lines, which are maintained by the respective telegraph offices.</p>
<p>The main components of line construction are wooden poles, wires, wooden crossarms (sometimes not used on branch lines due to fewer wires), and insulators (commonly called porcelain bowls, each with a straight foot or string hook). The lifespan of wooden poles varies depending on the quality of the wood, averaging about six to eight years. With proper maintenance, it may not exceed ten years. Although wires are more durable, they are eroded by wind and rain, and the outer layer tends to rust after being installed for many years, increasing resistance to telegraph communication. Therefore, even if they are not broken, their usable lifespan is only about eighteen years. In addition, the lifespan of wooden crossarms and insulators is even shorter, varying depending on the conditions along the line, and not uniform. Therefore, once a line is built, the daily management and inspection should be thorough. Due to the limited lifespan, in order to ensure good communication, it is necessary to carefully inspect the actual situation and carry out repairs and replacements.</p>
<p>In the past, the maintenance of main and branch lines in China often boasted "minor repairs every three years, major repairs every five years." Major repairs involved completely overhauling the entire line. However, during the era of warlord rule, telegraph facilities were often focused on immediate needs, neglecting the future. Even if the lines exceeded their maintenance lifespan, no preparations were made, and only temporary patching was done. This is like a building that is leaning and leaking, with dangerous signs appearing repeatedly due to procrastination. After the establishment of the National Government's Ministry of Communications, the policy guidelines emphasized line maintenance. Therefore, over the years, except for the impact of banditry or disasters (such as floods and typhoons), the main and branch lines have generally been able to communicate smoothly, even if the line construction was too old. The active efforts to renovate and refresh the lines have also continued without any slackening. In the past year, inquiries to the Ministry of Communications about the establishment of lines have revealed considerable progress. More achievements will be made this year. Lines are an important tool for wired telecommunications, and the simultaneous advancement of repairing old lines and expanding new lines will likely lead to a promising future for communication. Therefore, I have recorded what I have heard as follows.</p>
<p>Repaired Lines</p>
<p>(1) Plan: Surveying the main and branch lines across the country, except for newly established lines, those that have not undergone major repairs have been in service for more than ten years, or at least seven or eight years. Replacing all of them would be uneconomical and financially unsustainable. After considering the situation, a ten-year rotating replacement plan was devised. That is, one-tenth of the rotten poles and wires on the main lines will be replaced each year. In this way, all of them will be replaced within ten years, and the cycle will begin again, which can maintain the lifespan of the lines and meet the annual requirements. As for the branch lines, the urgency is assessed, and the situation is inspected. Old ones are replaced with new ones, aiming for widespread coverage. Although it is not possible to implement the same plan as the main lines, a precise step-by-step plan has been made for provincial-level maintenance.</p>
<p>(2) Statistics: In the past year, the Ministry of Communications repaired a total of 5,371 kilometers of wired telegraph lines. The two categories, main lines and branch lines, are distinguished and listed below.</p>
<p>(A) Main Lines: Total of 3,732 kilometers</p>
<p>Hankou to Jiujiang: 272 kilometers</p>
<p>Shunde to Zhangde: 138 kilometers</p>
<p>Tianjin to Jinan: 348 kilometers</p>
<p>Xuzhou to Pukou: 374 kilometers</p>
<p>Hejigang to Yangxin: 40 kilometers</p>
<p>Qingjiang to Xuzhou, Taizhuang, Lianshui: 421 kilometers</p>
<p>Gaomi to Xinpu: 316 kilometers</p>
<p>Nanjing to Datong: 190 kilometers</p>

<p>Ouchikou to Wuxizui: 17 kilometers</p>
<p>Shanghai to Gaochangmiao: 11 kilometers</p>
<p>Ankang to Shiquan: 150 kilometers</p>
<p>Hangzhou to Huzhou: 132 kilometers</p>
<p>Nancheng to Nanfeng: 69 kilometers</p>

<p>Gaoyou to Xinghua: 52 kilometers</p>
<p>Beiping to Gubeikou: 134 kilometers</p>
<p>Xingan to Yongfeng: 69 kilometers</p>
<p>The above refers specifically to landlines. In addition, the repair of underwater cables in various locations in the 22nd year [of the Republic] included Gaochangmiao to Chuansha, Xiamen to Gulangyu, Yantai to Weihaiwei, and Anqing to Yinjiahui, whether via inland rivers or by sea. Dredging and construction were all completed and restored.</p>
<h3>Overview of Step-by-Step Automatic Telephone Exchanges (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Installed at Edwin S. Telephone Exchange</p>
<p>(II) Advantages of Selectors</p>
<p>The selectors of the Strowger automatic telephone exchange have two movements, namely, stepping and rotation. This system only uses one type of rotary selector, each with a total of 102 connection sockets, arranged in a semicircle. Therefore, its parts are interchangeable and easier to maintain, which is more convenient and less troublesome than selectors with two movements. The total weight of the machine is lighter and takes up less space. The time required for wiring, whether local or long-distance, is faster than other types of automatic telephone exchanges, and the sound transmission is also better.</p>
<p>This device itself is also equipped with special equipment that other types do not have. That is, when the telephone traffic is particularly busy, the selectors in areas with simpler traffic can be transferred to areas with particularly busy traffic in a few seconds with simple actions, in order to make adjustments. Therefore, the number of selectors used on weekdays can be reduced.</p>
<p>(III) Advantages of Traffic Recording Equipment</p>
<p>This type of automatic telephone exchange is equipped with an automatic traffic recording meter, which is similar to the one used on the user line, to facilitate the examination of the usage of selectors and the allocation of resources.</p>
<p>(IV) Advantages Regarding Trunk Line Numbers for Small Exchanges</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the trunk lines used by small exchanges, which require sequential line testing during connection.) Even if the last two digits are zero, it does not matter. Each small exchange group can be expanded at will without changing numbers, and single-number users can also participate.</p>
<p>(V) Regarding the Connection Method between Small Branch Offices</p>
<p>In the same area, if there are several branch offices and the area is not very large, the exchange of users between all neighboring offices is mostly done directly, that is, entirely controlled by the user. However, for small branch offices that are relatively far apart (non-neighboring offices), whose communication lines are relayed through one or more intermediate branch offices, in order to save trunk lines and facilitate route allocation, a "storage" or "translation" equipment is used. Since the number of calls between users in such branch offices is not large, only a few storage or translation devices are needed. Also, if the direct lines to neighboring branch offices are all occupied, the incoming call number can be relayed by the central office. This "Alternative Trunking" can save about one-third of the relay. The bureau can adopt both of these methods. (The End)</p>
<h3>Regarding Telegraph Communications in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Reporter</p>
<p>Having read the short commentary "Telegraph Communications in Fuzhou" in the Tianjin Dagongbao on February 6, it roughly stated that the wired telegrams sent by reporters in Fuzhou took seven or eight days to be received, etc. According to personnel from the telegraph side, "The reason for the delay in Fuzhou telegrams is not because the telegraph lines have been damaged and have not been repaired, and must be forwarded via a detour. It is actually because after Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others initiated the rebellion in Fujian, the central government dispatched a large army to Fujian to suppress it. As the army marched, the telegraph offices in various places doubled the amount of reporting, and the Jiangshan-Jian'ou telegraph lines were occupied by two lines by the Transportation Department of the Military Affairs Commission to connect military telephones. As a result, although the Jian'ou, Pucheng, and Hangzhou bureaus have installed high-speed transmitting and receiving machines and added staff, it is still difficult to clear the backlog of telegrams. As for Fuzhou, all the telegraph lines in the north and south have been cut off, and all telegrams can only be relayed by radio, and there is no possibility of transmitting them via a detour. After the wired telegraphs were cut off, the wireless radio alone was responsible for the reporting of both sides, and it was difficult to clear the incoming and outgoing telegrams, so it was inevitable that there would be a backlog. As for the damaged lines along the way after the end of the Fujian incident, they were completely repaired as early as the 24th of last month, but because they are still occupied by the army, the direct Shanghai-Fuzhou work cannot be restored immediately. It was not until the 6th of this month that, after several consultations with the troops stationed along the line, the direct Shanghai-Fuzhou telegraph lines were connected. From then on, Fuzhou telegrams will be transmitted as usual, and there will be no need to worry about backlog," and so on. The reporter notes: Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the first aspect of transportation to be hit was telegraphs. For example, the army cuts off telegraph lines, occupies and borrows telegraph lines, inspects telegrams, and sends many military telegrams, all of which are fatal blows to private telegrams! Therefore, during wartime, it is possible that private telegrams may occasionally be delayed. However, this kind of fact is something that people in the telecommunications industry are extremely willing to avoid.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between the Beijing-Shanghai Long-Distance Telephone and the Press</h3>
<p>— Wang Qikun</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, an article by Mr. Ye Zhonghua, "A Discussion on Cooperation Between the Telecommunications Industry and the Press," described the service of the telecommunications industry to the press, and expressed his hope for cooperation between the two. However, the original article only described the situation of telegraphs, without mentioning telephones, so I would like to add a few words to broaden its meaning.</p>
<p>Recently, the press has mostly used long-distance telephones in addition to telegrams to transmit news. Taking Nanjing and Shanghai as an example, the news transmitted by long-distance telephones may not be less than the number of telegrams. The telephone bureau has always paid close attention to the long-distance calls made by newspapers and magazines, and strived to make them convenient; moreover, the news they transmit is not subject to inspection, so there is no delay, which should be well known to the press.</p>
<p>However, due to the small number of telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai, and the fact that newspapers and magazines use long-distance telephones at the same time, it is inevitable that there will be congestion at times, and it is necessary to change to express calls in order to be scheduled earlier. In addition, the Ministry of Communications has recently stipulated that newspapers and magazines that request cancellation of long-distance calls after they have been connected must pay one-third of the call fee, while ordinary calls do not. The above two matters may still not be fully satisfactory to the press. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications decided last year to set up four pairs of direct long-distance telephone lines along the Beijing-Shanghai highway, which can be used as six pairs. Construction has started and will be completed in three or four months. At that time, newspapers and magazines can make calls at any time without having to rush in advance. As for the cancellation of long-distance calls after they have been connected, it has now been changed to treat newspapers and magazines the same as ordinary users, and a fixed date has been set for implementation. Moreover, after the completion of the new telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai, calls will be smooth and will not be affected by excessive registration, so the temporary cancellation can be reduced.</p>
<p>According to the operating statistics of long-distance telephones between Beijing and Shanghai over the years, adding one pair of telephone lines to the existing telephone lines is enough to cope with everything; now suddenly adding as many as six pairs, costing five or six hundred thousand yuan, the purpose can be said to be entirely for the convenience of the press. From this, we can also see the spirit of service of the telecommunications industry to the press.</p>
<h3>National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph</h3>
<p>— Xu Yinlu</p>
<p>Chinese characters are complex and have many parts. They are not as simple as English, which uses only 26 letters to form different words and sentences. Therefore, in telegraph transmission, it is necessary to use a legal code to represent each character, that is, the so-called four-character code. Before a telegram is transmitted, the message must first be translated into a four-character code, and the receiving station then translates the four-character code into Chinese. Speed is essential for telegrams, and such translation is too uneconomical in terms of time and very troublesome in terms of procedures. Therefore, public telegrams sent by railways, ships, and telecommunications organizations mostly use English for the sake of speed and convenience. However, it must be said to be a kind of shame and embarrassment for our country, which claims to have a cultural history of several thousand years, to use English to send telegrams to ourselves!</p>
<p>Using English does not respect the national system, and using the four-character code has the trouble of double translation, so the wave of reforming my country's telegrams is swelling day by day. However, the basic condition for reforming telegrams is to create another kind of telegram that can be understood at a glance without translation. After a long period of research, the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph was produced in this brewing sound!</p>
<p>The so-called National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph is a telegram that is sent and received using the legal symbols to represent the phonetic alphabet. The sender only needs to write the phonetic alphabet, and the receiver knows the meaning of the text by reading the pronunciation. The procedures are simple, and the time is saved. When telegraphers have questions about receiving and sending, they can immediately ask on the machine, reducing errors. There is also a kind of National Phonetic Alphabet abbreviation to represent fixed names or idioms, in order to save the number of telegrams, such as "National Government" (國民政府) only needs to write　　　　, "Because of this order" (等因奉此)　　　　. If you specialize in using nouns with the same sound and different meanings or obscure words and sentences, you must first use pronunciation to adjust it. There are a total of one pronunciation: Yin, Yang, Ping, Shang, Qu, Ru. If the cut sound is not accurate, the word will be read differently. Then use the transmission department to distinguish the department affiliation of the word. There are a total of 102 transmission departments, dividing the various departments, which is easier to remember than the four-character code. For example, the word "electricity" (電); the National Phonetic Alphabet is "　｜　　｜　", "　｜　" is the pronunciation of the word electricity. "　" is the pronunciation, indicating that it is the Qu sound "　　" is the transmission department, representing that it is the Yu character department. Although a word requires six phonetic symbols to replace it, the words used in the pronunciation department are few, so we only need to memorize the pronunciation and transmission department, and any word can be solved! Before memorizing and generalizing, you can also check the "National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Compilation" compiled by the former Ministry of Communications Pinyin Research Association.</p>
<p>Telegrams sent abroad also have a kind of National Phonetic Alphabet Roman alphabet telegraph, which uses Roman characters to replace the National Phonetic Alphabet, and the organization is very sound. In addition, the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph also bears a major mission, which is to promote language unity! Promote cultural progress!</p>
<p>Anything will be more difficult when it is first started, and the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph is of course no exception. However, we must put aside personal interests and feelings, and think purely rationally for the sake of society, and we can immediately think of the need for active promotion and universality!</p>
<p>The National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph must first be promoted by our colleagues in the telecommunications industry. This is of course the case, but if the society is confused, the effect is still zero, so on the one hand, we must start the trial from the telecommunications industry, and on the other hand, we must actively publicize it and apply it to the society.</p>
<p>Now I will introduce the progress of the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph in the railway sector: Before the 11th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Communications held the Fourth Transportation Conference in Beiping. Mr. Tan Yaozong, the representative of the Sidao Railway and the inventor of the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph, proposed that the railway telegrams should be changed to the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph. The resolution was that the Sidao Railway should conduct a trial first. In July of the 14th year, the Sidao Railway completed its reform mission. After a three-year trial period, it was repeatedly obstructed and experienced many twists and turns, but enthusiasm and perseverance finally achieved the final victory.</p>
<p>Since the reform of the Sidao Railway was successful, the railways in the Northeast followed suit, and soon all were completely successful. Now all the railways in the Northeast uniformly use the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph, and they all feel that it is much more convenient than foreign languages and the four-character code. (It is said that after the September 18th Incident, the railways in the Northeast were forced to use Japanese telegrams. If this is true, the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegrams that have been painstakingly operated by the railways in the Northeast for several years will be completely destroyed.)</p>
<p>In March of the 19th year, the Ministry of Railways, in order to respect the national system, first ordered all railways across the country to use Chinese for all road use texts. Regarding railway telegrams, it was also decided to change to the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph in accordance with the precedent of the Northeast railways. Therefore, two Northeast National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph experts were hired to establish a National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph training class in the ministry. Officials from the ministry and Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, Xiang-E, and Nan-Xun railways were sent to attend the research. The graduates of the two phases were very successful, and the graduates were sent back to the road to promote the class teaching one after another, and the Beijing-Shanghai Tianjin-Pukou and the Ministry of Railways began to use the National Phonetic Alphabet for telegrams. It has been three years since then, and the effect is quite good. Subsequently, the Longhai Road Qing and other roads have also been taught. Now the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Shanghai roads are actively promoting the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Promotion Committee in order to complete the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph as soon as possible. We believe that in the near future, the railway telegrams will be completely National Phonetic Alphabet.</p>
<p>Scientific inventions progress with social needs, everything new replaces the old, and the perfect eliminates the unhealthy. Don't we think that using English telegrams is inappropriate? Don't we feel that using four-character code telegrams is inconvenient? Then we must actively reform. Reform must be the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph! We must complete the mission of reform as soon as possible; our colleagues in the telecommunications industry must work together!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the promotion of the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph, the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Compilation compiled and printed by the former Ministry of Communications in the 20th year of the Republic of China differs greatly from the current new standard of phonetic symbols of the Central Government. The Central Government has already sent personnel to revise it, and has taken the original manuscript to the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee in Beiping for detailed review. It is said that the compilation will be finalized soon, and work can be started.</p>

<h3>Postal and Telegraph Bureaus to Implement Joint Establishment</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate public communications and save expenses, the Ministry of Communications recently ordered the General Post Office to send personnel to Beijing to discuss the joint establishment of postal and telegraph bureaus with the Telecommunications Department of the ministry, and ordered the relevant postal and telegraph bureaus to expedite the joint establishment in accordance with the plan. The main points of the plan are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Third-class and lower-class telegraph bureaus should be jointly established with post offices in one location, starting with a trial in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces.</p>
<p>(2) For post offices with branches in major commercial ports, the telegraph bureau may set up receiving stations in the post office branches. For telegraph bureaus with receiving and sending branches, the post office may set up post office branches in each location. However, the business hours will still be in accordance with the business hours of the bureau where they are located.</p>
<p>(3) In major commercial ports where the Ministry of Communications has established city or long-distance telephones, the telephone bureau may install public telephones in each post office.</p>
<p>(4) In places where a telegraph bureau has been established but no post office has yet been established, a postal agency may be set up in the telegraph bureau, and the telegraph bureau will act as an agent for postal services.</p>
<p>(5) In places where postal and telegraph bureaus have not yet been jointly established, the telegraph bureau and the telephone bureau should sell stamps and receive and send ordinary letters.</p>
<p>The above plan will be implemented in succession in about two months. After that, public communications in various places will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3>Railway Telegrams Exempted from Additional Line Fees</h3>
<p>The railway station's collection and transfer of telegrams was originally set up to facilitate communication for the public in places where there are no telegraph bureaus but there are stations. However, in addition to charging according to the telegraph bureau's price list, each word of this railway line's transferred telegram must also be charged an additional line fee of two cents, which seems to be a burden on the sender. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications, in order to thoroughly facilitate the public and develop the railway telegram business, has decided that from March 1, the additional line fee that has been charged will be announced to all telegraph bureaus, and the Railway Department will be requested to forward it to all stations, so that all stations will be exempted, so that the fees are the same as those of the telegraph bureaus.</p>
<h3>Postal Transfer Telegrams Exempted from Postage</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications recently stated that postal transfer telegrams were originally set up to facilitate public communication in places where telegraph bureaus are not set up, and that the original postage of 25 cents per telegram should be exempted so that the public in remote cities can enjoy the same benefits as the public in large cities. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications has decided that from March 15, the post office and the telegraph bureau will implement this exemption of postage.</p>
<h3>Bureau and Station Telegram Envelopes Pre-Printed</h3>
<p>Telegraph bureaus and stations with busy reporting services often receive more than 1,000 or hundreds of telegrams per day. If the envelopes for the telegrams are written at any time, the reporting of each telegram will inevitably be delayed. In order to improve business, the Ministry of Communications has now ordered busy bureaus and stations to pre-print or write a large number of telegram envelopes for merchants or residents who receive a lot of telegrams. They are placed in a specially made telegram envelope rack for each household, so that they can be taken out and used at any time. After this method is implemented, the delivery of telegrams will be even faster.</p>

<h3>Financial Central Political Council Approves Silver Association Standard Gold to Fall Ten Yuan Three</h3>
<p>Central Bank Opens Spot to Support</p>
<p>Market Trend Once Rose Midway</p>
<p>The gold market suddenly fell yesterday. Although the mid-way situation was stabilized by the central bank opening spot and tight internal trading, various unfavorable news and rumors suddenly flourished, and finally became weak. In the early morning, although the overseas silver market shrank and the exchange rate also decreased slightly, the forward silver price on the gold exchange market rose by 4.5% to 5.3%. US cotton rose by two points, US wheat rose by 1/8. Canada approved the Silver Association agreement, and people's hearts became tired. The gross opening price fell immediately, but did not break the 40 yuan mark. After the opening, the bank's appetite was healthy and the exchange market tightened. HSBC listed the British and American rates unchanged. The central bank opened more than 400 bars (the price was based on the futures standard plus two yuan, opened by Wing Fung, Heng Tung, Tung Fung, Wing Tai, Hong Yun, Da De Cheng, Da Fung Heng, etc., with very thin interest. Today's Tianjin goods are made according to the standard plus 13 yuan, and the Tianjin gang has a purity of 99.1%, which is about 13 points higher than the futures standard. After calculation, there is only less than two yuan of interest, and it tends to rise. After a large number of households sold off, people's hearts suddenly became timid, and unfavorable news such as India reducing silver tax, China signing the Silver Association agreement, and the London silver market closing suddenly increasing by half a penny, spread. The exchange market also hardened, breaking the 40 yuan mark, and the selling pressure was overwhelming, causing a severe decline. The price of pure gold was 955 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 942.3 yuan, a decrease of 5.5 yuan from the previous close. The spot opened at 2.3 yuan. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of British exchange rate at 1 shilling 4.5 pence, and the US exchange rate at 34.9375 yuan. Hengxing went on the market to sell heavily, at 2.1 yuan. The Yokohama Specie Bank and McAlister were firmly supporting the June US dollar at 4.375, and were still stable. Later, Mitsui supported the June US dollar at 3.75, and Hengyu, Yicheng, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Mao Yonggan, Changxiang, Tianfeng, Yongchunyuan Yong and others all entered. It was expected that HSBC's listing would not move, and it rose to 4.2 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong Bing Xing Hongli sold off, although it fell by one yuan, but with the central bank opening spot, the market was purchased by Tung Fung, Yonggan, Changxiang and others. Meifeng supported the June US dollar at 3.75 and 3.125 hedge, and Tianfeng also entered, rising to 5.1 yuan. Not long after, Dade Cheng Gan Changxiang sold off, and the price went downstream. The news gradually deteriorated, and the internal trading also slightly loosened. Hengxing Yifeng Yong sold to within 4 yuan, but it was still calm. Later, the news suddenly turned bad, and Cuitai, Fuyu, Hengyu, Ruixing, Zhifeng, Yongdaxing Yong and others sold together to 2 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang Zhifeng Yong Fuyu sold again, breaking the 40 yuan mark. Finally, people's hearts became very weak and the selling pressure was sharp. Dade Cheng Yuanchun Tianfeng Yong and others even came to sell heavily, falling to 36.9 yuan. The noon closing was 937.5 yuan. After the market closed, short covering was slightly prevalent, rising to 8 yuan, and finally remained within 8 yuan. Spot trading was at 7.8 yuan. The highest price in the first half of the day was 945.1 yuan, and the lowest price was 936.9 yuan, a difference of 8.2 yuan. As a result, it fell 10.3 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The prices announced were: HSBC Bank's US dollar listing remained unchanged at 34.375 yuan, equivalent to a standard gold price of 1006 yuan. According to the closing price, about 69 yuan was deducted, which was 10 yuan more than the previous close.

<h3>Grains: Jiangsu-Zhejiang Early Rice Slightly Up by Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Various out-of-town groups have arrived with a total of over twenty firms (over 3,000 shi). Sales in various markets seem relatively active. Since the market opened, shops on this street have been quite sluggish. The market situation has slightly improved, but due to prolonged fatigue, it ultimately feels weak. Therefore, the quotations for Jiangsu-Zhejiang early rice accepted by everyone have slightly increased by five fen. The prices of other common Nan-gang varieties of rice and North China pointed varieties remain stable with no changes. Although the purchase of rice from out-of-town brokers is happening, it is not strong, but ultimately it is difficult to loosen the purchasing of goods, resulting in approximately two thousand packages of early green rice and late Songjiang and Xilian rice from the North and South China regions maintaining an average market performance. Prices remain unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fifteen or sixteen boats arrived from various groups from downstream. Sales of various goods in the market are still good. The price of white rice, Du-pointed rice, early Bo rice, and Bu-pointed Ke-pointed rice is fixed. Sheep-pointed rice is weak by a few fen.</p>
<h3>This Street Has a Smooth Sale of Ke Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian and Ke Hua were quiet, but local sales were very strong, and the market remained steady. Considering that the current supply and sales are balanced, the market situation may fluctuate for some time. Yesterday, only three hundred packages of Fuzhou unpolished red rice and two hundred packages of Ningbo unpolished red rice were available from out-of-town brokers, with no inquiries about anything else. Local demand was insatiable, and the entire city sold a total of over two thousand seven hundred packages of Jiangxi machine-processed early and late rice and unpolished red rice, and Zhejing, Shashi unpolished rice, Nanjing unpolished rice, and Wuhu and Wuxi machine-processed Xian rice. Quotations were similar to the previous market day.</p>
<h3>Soybean Market Shows No Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday the soybean market was stable. Prices for middle and lower grade goods were slightly tight by one or two fen. Factories had limited buying prices. High-grade exports were available but not smooth. The market showed no temporary changes. Yesterday's transaction volume included three truckloads of Zhengyangguan beans, two truckloads of Linhuaiguan beans, three truckloads of Suixikou beans, four truckloads of Bengbu beans, three truckloads of Bozhou beans, three truckloads of Yingzhou beans, more than one hundred packages of large-grain beans, and two truckloads of Feihe beans.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Granulated White Sugar Slightly Recovers by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Association set the plate at 424, and the price of rough granulated white sugar was still reduced by 19 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, but there were few inquiries. The price of high-grade re-exported goods was 6 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen, and over one hundred packages were traded. Number 9 cargo still cost 15 yuan 9 jiao, Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20 yuan and 1 jiao 5 fen, down by 5 fen. Only dozens of packages were traded. Over one hundred boxes of high-grade Shimen slices were opened, with a price of 9 yuan. The opening price of Chaozhou green was continued for over four hundred packages, with prices ranging from 11 yuan 5 jiao, 11 yuan 2 jiao, 11 yuan, 10 yuan 8 jiao, to 10 yuan 5 jiao. The market appeared tight and refined.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Sales Difficult to Revive</h3>
<p>(Inventory of Second-Grade Foreign Warehouses is Dwindling) The foreign firms in this port dealing in Chinese silk exports, recognizing that Japanese silk is being dumped at low prices in overseas markets and that Chinese silk prices are still difficult to stabilize, are unwilling to take risks by stockpiling existing silk. Since the beginning of winter last year, European and American firms have lacked large-scale purchases of forward silk, adhering to the principle of buying and shipping as needed. Therefore, the inventory of silk in foreign warehouses is dwindling. Yesterday, at the end of February, a field investigation was conducted at the silk warehouses of various foreign firms, and it was found that the total inventory of factory white, yellow, and gray silks was less than 800 bales, of which 235 bales were prepared for shipment to the Americas, 353 bales to Europe, and 190 bales to Asia.</p>
<p>(The Amount of Zhe Silk Transported to Shanghai is Decreasing Daily) Since the invasion of Japanese silk, the American sales of the compound-reeled silks produced in Zhejiang and Hunan (i.e., Ji Silk) have almost disappeared. As a result, most silk firms in the Xum (Nanxun) and Zhen (Zhenze) producing areas have suspended operations, and silk production is decreasing daily. Only a total of 247 bales of lower-grade dry reeled silk were shipped to Shanghai last month to meet the demands of Indochina firm (i.e., White Head foreign firm).</p>
<h3>Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bars Sell Actively</h3>
<p>Ribbed steel bars have recently been selling very actively, so the daily opening quantity has been as high as sixty or seventy tons. Transactions by construction groups on this street have also been quite brisk. In the past few days, orders have been placed for more than two hundred tons. The price for 2-fen material is 130 yuan per ton, and for 3-fen material, it is 127 yuan 5 jiao. Square material is generally estimated at 112 yuan, which is an improvement compared to before. It is said that overseas quotations have been gradually rising in recent days, so the market in this port may not easily decline in the short term.</p>
<h3>Corrugated Iron: Domestic Prices are Loosening</h3>
<p>The sales of corrugated iron have not been widespread in recent days, while arrivals have been very strong. In addition, East Asian goods have greatly reduced their prices, causing the domestic prices of British goods to gradually loosen. For example, the opening price for No. 22 and No. 24 is 12 yuan 4 jiao, for No. 36 it is 13 yuan 2 jiao, and for No. 28 it is 13 yuan 8 jiao, which is a decrease compared to before. It has been observed that there have been only a few transactions recently.</p>

<h3>Not Knowing Its Taste</h3>
<p>— Dun Pang</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Bai Yan talked about cormorants, saying that although they chase fish to serve their masters, they rarely get their fill. This reminded me of a story in "A New Account of Tales of the World":</p>
<p>"When Gu Rong was in Luoyang, he once attended a feast. He noticed that the barbecue chef had a longing look on his face for the roasted meat, so he stopped eating his portion and gave it to him. The others at the table laughed at him. Gu Rong said, 'How can there be someone who handles it all day long and does not know its taste?' Later, when chaos broke out and he crossed the Yangtze River, there was always someone by his side in times of danger. When asked why, it was the man who had received the roasted meat."</p>
<p>"Handling it all day long without knowing its taste" can also be used as a comment on cormorants. It turns out that there are such animals in the world, and there are such humans, but Gu Rong adds a "How can there be" at the beginning and a "eh" at the end, making a fuss and showing only his limited insight.</p>
<p>A Tang Dynasty poem about bees says, "After gathering hundreds of flowers to make honey, for whom is the hard work, for whom the busy effort?" This is also a metaphor for people who labor without enjoyment. However, human laborers are definitely not comparable to cormorants and bees.</p>
<p>I have also seen cormorants. Although they rarely get their fill before catching fish, they do get their fill when their work is done. At that time, they and the fishermen are content, lined up on both sides of the bamboo raft, shaking their feathers, chattering "Gaa! Gaa!" and enjoying the pleasure of rest. After returning home, the master does not ask them to do other work, and they have no worries about life, so they are actually very happy.</p>
<p>As for bees, just watching them laboring all day long while humming poems "Buzz! Buzz!" is like a group of "Tao Yuanming"-style "farmers." Although their products are exploited, they are not in a state of slavery in other aspects.</p>
<p>Moreover, cormorants in relation to fish, and bees in relation to honey, cannot be said to "not know its taste" after all; even in a state of exploitation, they can still taste a part of it. If the dragon liver, phoenix marrow, delicacies from land and sea enjoyed by the nobles, those who are hired as 'boys' truly get nothing. Therefore, the barbecue chef, having received a meal from Gu Rong, was endlessly grateful.</p>
<p>Gu Rong's words are just the silly words of an ignorant aristocrat, but they are also a question that cannot be answered even today.</p>
<h3>Reading Notes</h3>
<p>— Yuan Che</p>
<p>'Spare my life!'</p>
<p>Their voices were shrill. Most of them were young.</p>
<p>They jumped into the shell hole and crouched down. Some of our brothers went to the edge of the hole and shot at the huddled Germans. Many tightly clasped hands stretched out from the chimney-shaped grave, begging for mercy. But no one had any pity. The brothers shot at the hole...</p>
<p>The above passage is copied from Harrison's article "The General Died in Bed." Reading it made me extremely excited and reminded me of another similar but more tragic and terrifying thing. It was when I was a child that I heard it from my maternal uncle. He himself started as a soldier and went through many wars before becoming a company commander, "and his life was lost in the battle of Longquanyi when the Yunnan army approached Chengdu. Although he has been dead for more than ten years, his childlike, playful manner is still preserved in my memory. When he came back on leave, he would line me and other children up at my grandmother's house, shouting 'Turn left,' 'Turn right,' 'Lie down, the enemy is coming,' making such an interesting game of military exercises. This made me happy to pester him all day long, even when he was telling my grandmother and aunts stories about the battlefield, I would lie across his lap, listening while scratching his hands and chin. It was in such a scene that I heard the tragedy of the massacre of prisoners, which I could not forget.</p>
<p>At that time, whenever he mentioned the Yunnan army, he was very angry. He didn't call them the Yunnan army, he just called them "Yunnan brats" (although it is three characters, it should be pronounced as two syllables, "brats" must be read together), because, according to him, whenever "Yunnan brats" caught any of their brothers, they would always stab them to death with bayonets, without any mercy. So they treated the disarmed Yunnan army with even more cruel and vicious methods to vent their hatred. He said that once on the front line, many Yunnan soldiers were surrounded. They did not care how pitifully those poor people begged for mercy, but frantically stabbed at their mouths, eyes, and stomachs with bayonets. Later, they felt that it was still not satisfying, so someone suggested tying the remaining frightened prisoners upside down on trees with ropes, hanging them high in the air. Then one person climbed up the tree, took a knife, dug out the prisoner's intestines from his anus, tied them to a branch, and immediately released the rope holding him up. Then the prisoner's body would fall down slowly, and the bloody intestines would hang in the air like a rope. The prisoner died with strange wails and in a terribly tragic way. Everyone's heart of revenge was then happily satisfied. My uncle shook his head when he spoke of this, saying that it was too cruel. My grandmother, mother, and aunts were so frightened that they trembled, chanting "Amitabha" repeatedly. Comparing this with what Harrison wrote, the Chinese were undoubtedly more advanced than the foreign devils in terms of cruelty. Such a massacre of prisoners was just a small matter.</p>
<h3>Two Suicides</h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>Not long ago, Mr. Zhu Xiang suddenly committed suicide. His suicide as a poet and university professor should have caused a bit of a stir in society, in reason. However, the result disappeared lightly, just like a pebble thrown into the sea. Recently, Ms. Ai Xia also committed suicide in the midst of the firecracker noises when everyone was gathering happily with their families. According to social custom, her suicide as a woman and a star could have caused a sensation like that of Huang Huiru and Huang Baiying. However, this news has already left us as quickly as the Lunar New Year. Perhaps the event itself lacked the interest of a story. From this, we can know to what extent society has become numb, and people's suicides have become a commonplace event that no longer surprises.</p>
<p>However, the suicides of Mr. Zhu Xiang and others, especially when two such different types of people each embark on the same path from different starting points, is still a social problem worth considering, and we who live in society should think deeply about it.</p>
<p>I don't know much about Mr. Zhu Xiang's life. However, since I saw his article "On Writing" in "Literature," I have been a little worried about him. Because such a mystical view of art for art's sake inevitably leads to either consciously harming others or unconsciously ruining oneself. I am also not very clear about Ms. Ai Xia's life, but according to many friends, she was a relatively progressive woman who had struggled with society, so it was completely unexpected that she would finally desert from the arduous path of life.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Zhu Xiang's suicide was mainly due to unemployment; Ms. Ai Xia's suicide was mainly due to heartbreak. Unemployment and heartbreak are originally the source of two major pains in life, but there is no other way besides suicide. And in fact, there are still a large number of unemployed and heartbroken people living. Therefore, their suicides should naturally be the responsibility of society, but further explanation cannot but be sought from themselves. Mr. Zhu Xiang was a poet, and a genius poet praised in his environment. It is certainly valuable to be a poet with genius, but if one thinks of oneself as a genius, feels that one's every word and deed is the law and truth of the universe and society, the result will be to detach oneself from society and people and go to another uninhabited world, and a world very far from society and people is "death." Ms. Ai Xia may have thought herself very clever, at least the kind of environment in which only people buy her goodwill would not make her believe that she was not clever. Naturally, she could walk those unfamiliar roads with her eyes on the sky, carelessly. Walking in this way often leads to slopes and even cliffs, and finally falling to one's death. A clever woman originally has a very good future, but the greatest danger is that the cleverness is flaunted so self-importantly that it turns into something that destroys herself. Because in the midst of flaunting cleverness, she can easily cause others to lose themselves, and also easily cause herself to lose others, and the result is often to lose herself at the same time. This is a worldly wisdom that I have seen too much of, and I only hope that Ms. Ai Xia was not like this!</p>
<p>There is no need to say anything that is close to blame. They can be said to have taken out their last lives to show their kind hearts that would not kill others but would only commit suicide. They did not borrow the lives of others to continue their own lives.</p>
<p>Suicide is cowardly and brave, worthy of condemnation and worthy of sympathy. From the perspective of society, although a person has his own life, he does not exist for himself alone. The universe is constantly growing, the earth is constantly moving, and people are the offspring that protect their lives. A person must not fail to take responsibility for human society. Society is too dark, and we should strive to make it bright; humanity is too terrible, and we should strive to improve it. Even if one has to die, at a minimum, one should make those who create darkness and terror die before oneself. In the gamble of life, is death not the greatest capital? Therefore, a person's suicide is cowardly and worthy of condemnation. But if we look at it from the perspective of individual virtue, it is sometimes brave and worthy of sympathy. Suicide itself requires the greatest courage, at least it shows that one cannot live in a compromising and opportunistic way. What does it mean to live quietly and die quietly? Furthermore, not everyone lives meaningfully: some people live for survival and for meaning, that is, they live meaningfully and strive for meaningful survival, and finally even abandon their own survival to strive for meaning; others live only for survival and not for meaning, even destroying all meaning and living sinfully. For a person who cannot strive for meaningful survival or live meaningfully, but does not attempt to live sinfully, in a passive way, suicide may not be a good way for them to deal with themselves, and this can contain countless sorrows and pains. Moreover, when the freedom to die is deprived from ordinary people, their actions of disposing of their own lives and deaths with full freedom may be felt as a kind of resistance and satisfaction by themselves. What else can we break away from? However, this ultimately lacks a bit of tragic grandeur, that is, dying is not tragic enough.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, although Mr. Zhu Xiang and Ms. Ai Xia both walked the path of suicide, their starting points were completely different; one can be said to be one who cannot, and perhaps does not want, to eat people in the old, and one can be said to be one who has not, and perhaps does not want, to endure hardship in the new, so one committed suicide because of resentment at not being recognized, and the other committed suicide because of a lack of fighting spirit. Needless to say, from this we can see the inevitable fate of those who cannot make a sudden turn in the struggle between the old and the new, and Mr. Zhu Xiang and Ms. Ai Xia are just two victims standing at the forefront.</p>
<p>In today's society, killing is going on every day, and in fact, there are many suicides. It is not limited to Mr. Zhu Xiang and Ms. Ai Xia! However, the customs of general society only see the things that float on the surface. I cannot avoid being vulgar, so I will only mention them to express my opinion.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Seal Lake</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>These past few days my heart has been quite restless, and I often like to meditate when I have nothing to do. Especially the Buddhist Seal Lake in my hometown: the verdant mountain scenery and the clear blue water deeply evoke my nostalgia at all times.</p>
<p>When I was at home, whenever I felt distressed, I would often invite two or three friends to take a stroll there. Walking slowly under the shade of the trees along the flat lakeside road. Smelling the fragrance of unknown herbs, and seeing the brilliant wild flowers exuding fat calyxes, I felt very happy in my heart.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would climb to the top of the mountain to look out over the wilderness, seeing the well-like fields, the undulating green waves of rice, and the corner of a red wall of a temple hidden in the green trees, just like reading a rhythmic prose poem. I often lingered there for a very long time, and could not bear to go back.</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival, the tombs on the mountains on both sides fluttered with ribbon-like white paper. Looking from a distance, they looked like powder butterflies flying in the grass. Sometimes, countless black dots of kites were nailed in the blue sky, quite like the stars in the summer evening. When the weather was gloomy, the mournful cries of widows flowed out of the mountain hollows, and the gentle and dying sound rippled on the lake, adding countless desolations to this quiet lake and mountain.</p>
<p>In summer, the scorching sun shone on the ground like fire. But under the willows of the Buddhist Seal Lake, it was still very cool. At this time, you could see many tea drinkers occupying a seat under the willows leaning against the mountain and water, slowly sipping tea, and lazily talking idly.</p>
<p>When I was suffering from the heat, I often liked to run to this place. First, I would brew a pot of tea at the lakeside tea house, and then occupy a small table under the willows. I would change my position as the shadow of the sun moved.</p>
<p>The drooping willows by the water gently fanned the breeze; the fish in the lake talked to the algae. In this quiet scene, listening to the lonely cicadas chirping, the feeling of "wealth and honor are floating clouds" could not help but arise in my heart.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if the weather was not very hot, I often liked to run to this place. Facing a pot of tea, I meditated peacefully; sitting alone for most of the day. Although I have no such addiction to tasting tea.</p>
<h3>The Diary of Mary Machinaff (IV) by Stephen Leacock</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ye Zi</p>
<p>Five days later - Oddo and I do not want to die! We shall escape together, by the time Alexis comes, we are already far away. However, Oddo told me that it is not good to leave empty-handed. Therefore, I give a parcel to my knight everyday, telling him to put these parcels in his hotel. The day before yesterday, I gave him a jewellery box. Yesterday, listening to him, I withdrew the savings from the bank, today, he cleverly told me to steal the keepsakes of my father and mother… Therefore, tonight, I intend to take my father’s gold watch whilst he is asleep… By tomorrow, Oddo and I, the two of us will leave this place forever.</p>
<p>X X X X X X X X X</p>
<p>The following night - my heart is broken! The thing that I feared suddenly happened; … Alexis has arrived. He and Oddo are fighting! … It looks really scary!... Oddo and I were in the pasture, suddenly, Alexis appeared, his stature was originally tall, and his momentum was very fierce. I shouted:</p>
<p>“Oddo! I love… Let’s go… do not kill him!”</p>
<p>Oddo hesitated for a moment and then escaped… How noble he escaped! However, Alexis chased him. They then fought! … Ah! What a scary sight! … Alexis grabbed Oddo’s waist, tossing him around like a stone.</p>
<p>His pants tore; Oddo fell on the grass; Alexis kicked him, then dragged him up, and pressed a wooden yoke onto his shoulders. Then, lifting his butt, threw him into the river. My poor Oddo began to struggle in the river, his head sticking out of the yoke.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Alexis turned around and walked towards me, held me, and brought me back to my house, muttering sweet words…</p>
<p>This is really killing me! I am going to marry Alexis, at the same time, the situation of that poor Oddo, intrudes into my imagination. I thought of him struggling in the water with a wooden yoke. The river will take him to the Dnieper, to the Bug, to the Volga, and then to the Caspian Sea. But that Caspian Sea is not connected to other seas, so maybe Oddo will roll around in it… My heart is broken. I want to cry. (The End)</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Divorce</h3>
<p>— Nai Shuo</p>
<p>| I Support Divorce, But Do Not Advocate for It |</p>
<p>The general public, upon hearing the word "divorce," immediately deems it "heretical and rebellious," which is, in fact, a misconception. Indeed, divorce has often carried a tragic connotation in Chinese history. However, we must understand that this is not inherent to divorce itself, but rather a product of the social system of the past and its trappings. Conversely, divorce is the very means to resolve tragedies between men and women; it is the gospel for modern relationships. This may sound surprising to some.</p>
<p>Originally, according to the doctrines of those conservative Confucian scholars, divorce was indeed "heretical and rebellious" because their societal mindset was deeply rooted in ritual and ethics. The creed for women was to remain faithful to one husband until death, and the dogma of marriage was that divorce should not occur unless there were offenses such as violating chastity or disrespecting elders. Naturally, in such a time, if you wanted a divorce, your wife must have committed one of the seven great sins of women, and society would exert its power of sanction, subjecting the woman to all sorts of abuse. Moreover, such women lacked skills to independently earn a living, and their families, apart from a meager dowry, could not offer any economic support. The outcome of divorce was indeed somewhat tragic. We do acknowledge that there is some validity in the sentiments of those conservative Confucian scholars.</p>
<p>However, this remains fragmented. If we contemplate with a calm mind, we will still discover the foolishness and pitiableness of those conservative Confucian scholars. When observing or thinking about anything, one should always stand before it, gaze at it, and allow its true and concrete shadow to be etched in our hearts, leaving a profound impression. Then, let us carefully ponder. Only in this way can we delve into the core of the matter and fully understand its true nature.</p>
<p>Thus, we turn back to examine the current issue of divorce. In the union of men and women, why does the phenomenon of divorce occur? To think this way is to confront the real aspect of the problem. Further expanding, consider the fall of celestial bodies, the detachment of ripe fruit from branches, the division of political factions, and the battles between allied nations. Continuing to examine their causes, we can certainly understand that their separation is due to intense conflicts arising during their respective developmental processes. When these conflicts reach a point where there is no possibility of resolution, they cannot but separate. Following the same pattern, we can find the contradictions in the union of men and women. We know that during the stage of courtship, emotions often easily mask individuality. When we observe our beloved, we always strive to uncover her (or his) virtues and pay no attention to her flaws. Later, because everyone feels that the other person is full of virtues and everyone feels satisfied, they unite. In married life, whether man or woman, they no longer cautiously suppress their own individuality or inherent quirks as they did during courtship. This is where the issues of compatibility and incompatibility of personalities, and the ability or inability to sustain virtues arise. For example, if you are a sensitive person with a literary hobby, but your husband is a science student whose mind only thinks in terms of "W + Y = X," you will naturally become estranged due to the difference in hobbies. It's as if when your husband comes home, you hope he will embrace you for a while; before going to sleep, you want him to tell you romantic words, but your husband considers it the most boring and dull thing. It's as if in your conversation with your husband, you talk about how profound a certain poem or novel is, but your husband only talks about things in the dissection room. It's also as if you are neat and sociable, while your husband is slovenly and reclusive. These are naturally the places where your personalities do not match. At this time, if you live together longer, the development of your personalities will only further distance you. Thus, a couple who were originally the closest and most intimate people now become the most distant and unfamiliar union. In such alienated and indifferent lives, deeper pain will naturally arise. No matter which standpoint you take, no one would hope for a painful life to remain with them forever. On the contrary, they are most willing to fight for happiness. If we are in such a painful life of a male-female union, then what other option do we have besides divorce? Therefore, when I talk about the issue of divorce, I have considerable support for it. My support is because in nature, forced unions and separations are impossible, and in the human world, forced unions and separations are also impossible. If a union is impossible, separation is inevitable. If one does not follow the dictates of this natural law, there will only be endless suffering. As for divorce being disadvantageous to women, the facts are not entirely true. The so-called disadvantages generally include the difficulty of remarriage and the burden of children. Regarding the difficulty of remarriage, people generally believe that the value of a virgin is higher than that of a non-virgin; a remarried woman is always considered flawed jade. This, of course, is not worth a scoff from those with knowledge; it is the most vulgar thing. The central point of their theory is nothing more than that virgins are most likely to possess a firm sense of chastity, while remarried women seem to have lost the guarantee of their chastity. Is the concept of chastity directly tied to the hymen? Are women without a hymen necessarily more promiscuous and unfaithful in love than virgins? This is a pathetic joke. I feel that besides considering such opinions vulgar and unbearable, there is nothing else to say. As for the burden of children, I feel that this is a non-issue. Because in the tenets of divorce, the party who initiates the divorce is bound to bear the living expenses of the children. This burden of living expenses is certainly not a form of social punishment, but a personal obligation that should be fulfilled. For the sake of liberating oneself from the pain of life and breaking free from mental shackles, it is certainly an obligation that should be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I support divorce, but I do not advocate for it.</p>
<h3>In the Dormitory</h3>
<p>— Mei Jun</p>
<p>The autumn breeze is so clear and refreshing. In this near-rural area, it is especially filled with a serene and secluded atmosphere, but it inevitably seems somewhat desolate and bleak. The waves of my heart, as still as dead water, often surge with inexplicable tides, faintly seeming to sob. Is it depression?</p>
<p>In middle school, I eagerly longed for the so-called sacred halls of the university. I used all my efforts to fulfill my wish, and actually stepped into the gate of the university, listening to lectures with excitement, curiosity, and fear. However, the beginning was particularly uncomfortable. The gazes of the male students were even more terrifying than those of the hooligans on the street. Whether it was sharp, or silent, or even seemingly gentle, they were all particularly piercing. Loud or low voices only made me feel that their every move contained a kind of distasteful and terrifying flavor that was unapproachable. A new life full of enthusiasm and hope had become faintly dull after just over a month. I can't say what the reason is!</p>
<p>I have no close friends to confide in and vent my endless complaints. I can only occasionally meet with my diary to vent my frustrations and slightly soothe my mind.</p>
<p>I am trying hard to be calm and clear, but the surrounding atmosphere is suffocating, and some phenomena are truly strange.</p>
<p>During the day, I already feel bored. I thought the night would be more comfortable, but the university dormitory, meant for studying, is as noisy as a teahouse or theater in Shanghai, making people weary. Unfortunately, our female dormitory is adjacent to the male dormitory. At night, noisy sounds often come from the male dormitory: not clear and melodious singing, but rather out-of-tune shouting, and every sound seems to have some deep meaning, a deep meaning that makes one vaguely aware of something terrifying. Mixed with playful and sharp laughter and shouts, the phonograph is also turned on. Sometimes Cantonese and Beijing opera tunes are mixed together in a discordant way, and one can't make out anything, just a bunch of unpleasant noises. The sound of mahjong tiles can almost be heard, but not very clearly. It has become customary to have this show every night. I wonder how they read their books, and what the school authorities are doing. With such a school spirit, one can't help but think that the sanctity of education has gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>Tonight, I heard their vulgar song: "...As long as your heart..."</p>
<p>It really makes me feel embarrassed for them. The more cultured one in the union can play the piano, but it always feels out of tune, even though I don't understand the piano. Those sounds of theirs are, of course, annoying, but they also seem to have some kind of power, making one feel particularly depressed. Many female students are so disturbed that they have no heart to study and can only sing softly. Sometimes I am really too bored and will unconsciously join them for a few sounds, but it is always tasteless. Where is my soul going?</p>
<p>Last night's strange phenomenon really disgusted me: two classmates in the same room seemed to be laughing and joking freely, as if something had provoked them. It was after dusk, around 9 pm, in the cool and pleasant night air, I was quietly reviewing my homework when the giggling and surprised movements of the two female classmates on the window-side bed suddenly disturbed me. I looked up and saw a beam of white light from a flashlight shining into the room from the dark outside the window, directly onto the table near the window. I was very surprised at first, but in an instant, I understood that this light was coming from the male dormitory across the way. I turned and was suddenly stunned. Looking at the window, I could vaguely see a few shadowy figures moving and wriggling in the windows of the male dormitory across the way, as if they were doing something. I was really angry and burst out cursing at these so-called high-class hooligans of the university. They were also laughing and gesturing as they criticized. Without waiting for their opinions, I reached out and closed the window, but before it was fully closed, the male students across the way let out a particularly loud and victorious laugh. This burst of laughter pierced my heart, and I felt suddenly that my cheeks were burning, and my body was rushing faster, unable to sit still, feeling ashamed, embarrassed, and terrible. Lying down, I just tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep, the gentle quilt and comfortable smell all disappeared. Thinking about it carefully, I felt more distressed and disappointed, making me unable to doubt this kind of life.</p>
<p>After the lights were turned off, I was still vaguely tossing and turning, unable to sleep, and gradually it seemed much quieter.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I don't know why my mood was even more chaotic. Holding my head, I felt oppressed and empty. The night bell rang, cutting off my heartstrings...one o'clock...three o'clock...</p>
<p>When I got up in the morning, the female classmate who slept by the window also told me that after the window was closed, she saw the light from the flashlight hovering on the glass of the window several times again. If it wasn't flashing, one might have suspected it was moonlight. Perhaps the female classmate was also disturbed a little in the night, so she also put on a serious face and scolded those boring college students. How barbaric and terrifying is this behavior! I added another layer of feeling insulted in my heart.</p>
<h3>Movie Stars and Dancers</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Previously, we always felt there was a distinction between movie stars and dancers. Their social status and value were incomparable. At least, movie stars were slightly better than dancers, and they left a more fulfilling impression in the minds of the general public. But now, the reality is far from that. Film merchants purely adhere to a profit-driven ideology, making use of movie stars' thighs and breasts as advertising gimmicks to attract business. A quick glance at the daily newspapers reveals large, sensational advertisements that are everywhere. This kind of sexual fetishism is not unique to China. The film industry in Europe and America has even gone further. In this capitalist society, any profession is inevitably commodified. Film merchants, in order to increase their business profits, compete to imitate each other, creating novelties and eccentricities. The more vulgar, the better, to cater to the low-level tastes of the petty bourgeoisie. As a result, sensational productions are produced in large quantities, and the film industry's atmosphere becomes naturally foul-smelling.</p>
<p>And it is undeniable that female stars are happy to sacrifice their beauty. It is precisely because female stars can sacrifice their beauty that wealthy bosses do not worry about being unable to make money. Female stars have fallen to this level, only fifty steps away from dancers who embrace for a dollar. We can cite one or two things to illustrate. Earlier, there was the case of Li Li, a dancer from Da Hua Dance Hall, who went on to the silver screen, but ended up returning to the jazz music scene to live her original life. Recently, there was the case of Liang Saizhen, who once surprised people by switching from a career on the silver screen to becoming a dancer. They all say that it is because the income of a star is far less than that of a dancer, and to satisfy their needs, they only have this one path. These are all words of sorrow, frank words. In fact, whether it is from star to dancer, or from dancer to star, it is nothing more than a change in an individual's living environment. There is nothing to be surprised about. Moreover, everyone's thoughts and actions cannot fundamentally escape the control of economic power. In order to seek a more comfortable life and change their lifestyle, regardless of how the new lifestyle is changed, we cannot superficially decide that their behavior is wrong or degenerate, but should criticize it based on objective conditions. How can we simply criticize the many women who run to the streets at night to sell their bodies and smiles as willingly degrading themselves? Those who fall are not willingly degraded. But objective facts make it so.</p>
<p>Honestly, movie stars and dancers are one and two, and two and one. The wave of the world economic panic has swept the globe, and the decline of the film industry is getting worse every day. The stars engaged in film are deeply aware of the shaking of their status and the misfortune of the future. Even the general stars of Hollywood, who have the highest salaries in the world, are experiencing life's panic, let alone others. As a maze for the leisure class, as long as the gentleman class and bourgeoisie do not collapse, the dance hall will not be eliminated for a day. In the long run, the general stars who have no way out may all flock to the path of becoming a dancer, who knows.</p>
<h3>The Threshold of Fighting</h3>
<p>— Tao Dan</p>
<p>"Fighting" seems barbaric, but in this modern world where only power exists and there is no justice, it is better to use force to gain some advantage. At the same time, "fighting" is also necessary. When resentful, wanting someone to be patient is likely to cause health problems. So, in the past, a group of rich masters and ladies - and there are still some now - bought many slaves in advance, ready to use them as a frame to vent their anger when they were unhappy. So, I say: When you can hit someone, why not hit them? However, there is a threshold for hitting, and those who are not proficient in the threshold will not only fail to hit anyone, but may also be beaten instead. Those who hit people, can't you be careful?</p>
<p>Fighting has its own goal. Those who hit people must not overestimate their abilities and act rashly. You must understand the principle of "know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." You must have the confidence, and you should first consider whether you can withstand his counterattack. So, for those who are taller and bigger, it is better to adopt a "long-term resistance" method, taking a step back as a good strategy. So-called calm attitude, calm response, avoid eating immediate losses. Conversely, when your fists are itchy, seeing consumptives, opium addicts, etc., or even women and children, those small and weak nationalities, you may as well roll up your sleeves, pull out your fists, and show off your skills, and I guarantee that you will not suffer losses.</p>
<p>Speaking of fighting, you can't help but think of cursing. To hit someone, you must first curse, and this is also reasonable. Like when two sides go to war, before mobilizing troops, there must first be a telegram declaration, listing the other side's crimes, so that others will believe that we are sacrificing for justice. Cursing before fighting is the same principle. Then, the spectators can all criticize the other party's shortcomings, saying that you are reasonable. Even if he really doesn't have much wrong, you may as well catch him on a small matter - it doesn't matter if it doesn't concern you, just make a big fuss over a small issue, and speak nonsense as you please, as long as you curse loudly enough.</p>
<p>Maybe you are afraid before you start, which is simply the behavior of a coward. In fact, there is no need to worry. Anyway, if you lose, just put on a straight face, shake hands with the other party, and congratulate him on his success. To the audience? You may as well say: "Victory or defeat is commonplace in war, why bother mentioning it? Moreover, failure is the mother of success, look at this day next year." Of course, it is still best not to come on this day next year. A great man has ambitions in all directions, and why can't he avoid it from afar. Further, if you really sacrifice your life for hitting someone, there is no reason for that. Sixteen years later, you will still be a good man?</p>
<p>Finally: I declare first! Although I have no experience in fighting, I dare say that this whole threshold is theoretically established; if you don't believe it, you may as well try it. As for fighting and causing a lawsuit involving human life, that is because your fist is too effective, and I cannot be responsible.</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Does This Also Warrant Suicide!</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am from Beijing, and I have a difficult problem that requires guidance. Please answer it in the Amateur Mailbox column.</p>
<p>A weak girl, Jia, is nineteen years old this year. When she was very, very young, her parents betrothed her to a relative, Yi, as his wife. Later, they often met and found that the fiancé was very rude, especially his stubborn temperament. Therefore, since the engagement, she has never had her fiancé in her mind. She is extremely sad and has always had thoughts of death. She insists that no matter what, she cannot marry him. Yi is my closest friend, and I have considerable feelings for him. So, I previously advised Jia not to resort to extremes, but to no effect. However, Jia is very fond of me, often expressing her willingness to cancel the engagement with Yi and marry me. Because I am fond of her, and after careful observation in all aspects, I feel that she has a good conscience. Coupled with the fact that we are getting closer day by day, we have recently reached the peak of love. Her parents also agree with me, and we two have verbally engaged. Her parents also agree. If I didn't know Yi, there would certainly be no problem. However, if I don't marry Jia, Jia will in fact have to find another partner, that is, force a marriage and divorce in the end: because Jia was looking for a partner before she loved me, and she had already decided that she would rather die than marry, in order to clarify her name and plan another. So, I feel that in fact I have not wronged Yi. However, if I tell Yi, I am not a friend. But if I leave Jia because of this, then I still wronged Jia. I am now in a very difficult situation, loving Jia but afraid of wronging Yi, so I have the idea of ​​loathing the world. I opened a room at the China Grand Hotel in the capital, ready to die to thank Jia and Yi. However, I am a weak person. After two days here, I am still hesitant. Seeing your newspaper's Amateur Mailbox, I have the idea of ​​stealing my life. If you can give me a good idea, there may still be hope for survival. I hope you will reply soon, reply in the newspaper, my surname is Cheng, I will not announce my name, then I will be grateful, and the kindness will be the same as rebuilding. There are also three small questions, please answer them together.</p>
<p>(1) Should I put love for Jia above the sacredness of love? Or friendship for Yi?</p>
<p>(2) If love should be prioritized, of course this friend must be sacrificed, and there should be no contact with him. But I still want to contact him. Is there a good way?</p>
<p>(3) Jia and Yi are both my friends. If this difficult problem was asked by Jia, then how should Jia treat Yi and me? Please put yourself in Jia's shoes and guide her.</p>
<p>Cheng Qi, February 20th, at the Capital China Grand Hotel</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Cheng, don't commit suicide. There is no need to commit suicide. Moreover, people don't need to commit suicide at all. Although the method offered to you by the editor may not be the best method, as long as you try your best to find it, there is always a method. Why do you have to think about suicide?</p>
<p>Marriage should always be based on love, which is a fact, not an ideal. The "girl" you requested, she doesn't love "Yi" at all, so if she marries "Yi", she will certainly be ruining herself, not to mention that...</p>
