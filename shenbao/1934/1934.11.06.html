<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北的水利</h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>水利是關於農業最大的問題。我江蘇數千萬人民渴望的導淮。經省政府竭力提倡之下。已初步實現了。當然是我政府整理水政之第一偉舉。近聞華北水利委員會。亦議定開鑿河北省萬全縣洋河大渠。以利其所屬區域的農業灌溉。這也可謂為開發華北水利的動機。南方的導淮。在初步。北方的開濬洋河大渠。亦僅有此决議。且就全國地方事業上看去。似乎與整個國民經濟的關係很微。受益的也是局部。但我們知道水利灌溉事業。在今日事實上已引起全國上下的深刻注意。而且這一問題。在南方固然重要。而在北方各地區。尤覺不可稍緩。蓋長江以南。雖亦感受旱災。然以雨量較多。河流交义較繁。或不甚感到雨水過少的苦痛。即偶然感到。人工之補救。也較容易。至於北方各省區。尤其是察哈爾等。河流更少。如要實行農業上的開發。那非先從水利上着手不可。</p>
<p>現在華北真正享有水利的地方。實在太少。其最著名的。要推蒙古河套。和陝西涇惠渠的附近地方。次之。如輝縣的百泉。彰德的水野。平西的玉泉。太原的晋祠等。亦都能實行灌溉。並種植稻子了。但是受惠的地方。究不普遍。就大體上講還算不得水利。至於多數的地方。非特在農村中没有溝渠。作水利的工具。即號稱城市和省會亦都缺乏水道。任排洩汚水之用。夏秋之季。雨量稍多。便如洪水横流。四處氾濫。到了冬天。河道乾渴。又可成為天然的道路。汾河如此。滹沱河上流也如此。這種情形。如不加以人工改造。和自然相鬥争。農民的生計那有復蘇的希望。</p>
<p>在北方最感水利需要的。是河南省從中牟到商丘一帶地方。因為當地雨量不足。灌溉無方。所以土質漸次磽瘠。有多少植物栽種不活。長此以往。再過數百年。恐怕有變成一片石田之虞。所以横在我們眼前的。有兩種病態的事實。一種是不斷的發生水災。一種是逐漸變成石田。追本溯源。則是水利不修的結果。</p>
<p>疏通溝渠。本是水利事業中的要圖。從事於大規模的復興農村運動。尤其少不了這一套。但其收效往往是局部的。有制限的。原來必須當地有了天然的河流或其支流。纔能因勢利導開渠濬溝。實收灌溉之利。北方河流既少。自然很難普遍。惟有鑿井一事。所受天然的制限比較的少。幾乎隨處都可以鑿井得泉。祗是目前窮困達於極點的華北農民。那有鑿井的餘資。所以説到鑿井。不僅要公家的水利機關作探查水源的顧問。指導鑿井的工作。還得動用公欵。開鑿較大的公井。供給農民使用。即不然亦須低利貸欵。專為農民鑿井之用。有合作社地方的。儘可委託合作社去辦。那末。水利事業的好處。纔能比較的普遍於華北民間。</p>
<p>至於華北原有的河流。亦正須設法疏濬。不然。那些漸見污塞的河道。都不免有釀成水災的危險。現在要疏濬黄河。事實上有多少的困難。但先行疏濬各小河。如淇水。衛水。滹沱河。猪龍河之類。總還是地方政府的財力所能勉强作得到的。就在必要時。也許可得中央政府特殊的補助。不過經營這種重大的水利工程。不僅須有的欵。還要有計劃和人才。不如鑿井一事來得輕而易舉。</p>

<h3>怡生輪綁架案内李希庭已返滬</h3>
<p>槍殺一人病死一票</p>
<p>怡和洋行怡生輪、本年三月十二日、在福州洋面、被盗刦掠、臨行綁去旅客六人、久未釋放、直至近日、匪首始將肉票李希庭（上海華昌泰夥）放岀、李刻已由香港來滬、據談在匪窟内歷盡痛苦、饒有趣味、兹將詳情分述如下、</p>
<p>困居山洞　被架六人、由匪帶到廣東惠州鄉間沿海山中、六人所居之處、係在濱海高山頂上石洞内、洞甚深廣、可居多人、六票並不在一處、每一肉票、派匪二三人看守、日間不許岀洞、食宿均在洞中、至夜稍得自由、每間四五天、即須遷地、但仍在山洞中、恒於夜間行之、不令得知路徑、但知爬山越嶺而已、</p>
<p>待遇甚好　六人綁架到山、第一天、由匪首傳知匪衆、殺豬設宴、慶賀凱旋、各肉票亦各給予肉食待遇肉票、每日三餐、魚肉兩項、恒不斷絶、數月後、李希庭與匪混熟、日間亦不十分拘束、有時且由匪約、同往雀戰、故漸可自由行動、蓋匪知其確無財産也、</p>
<p>接洽贖票　六月間匪令各票通知家屬、納欵取贖、最先接洽者、為一粵籍商人、在香港旅館中、談判贖票、結果、以四千元代價、首先釋放、餘五人中、獨李無人至港、與匪商贖、匪首為欲明瞭各農家庭狀况起見、密遣羽黨兩人、至上海廣東兩處、秘密調查、故各人家庭真相、匪均洞知、</p>
<p>兩人已死　各肉票久居山洞、水土不報、無一不患脚氣病、内有一自京到粵之學生、竟因脚氣病、致全身發腫、匪首曾請醫代治、結果仍死於匪窟、尸體抛入海内、另一南京肉票、因其家屬派人到港、與匪接洽時、密報警探、欲將匪代表掩捕、結果、匪未被獲逃歸山中、報告匪首後、匪首立將該票拖至山上用手槍擊斃、棄尸海中、</p>
<p>釋李原因　李希庭略明醫理、兼知相術、匪資有患花柳病者、有生横痃症者、由李為之開方治愈、李又為匪首論相、大為激賞、匪徒多以老李呼之、李屢求釋放、匪首允俟肉票張正宇、與怡和香港大班西崽何某、贖欵講妥後、即行放岀、</p>
<p>二票贖價　張正宇及何某兩人、由其家屬再度與匪在港談判、已經議妥、張何兩票、各繳二千元、俟欵到即放、據匪首言、渠行刧怡生輪、船上祗得五千餘元、綁架六人、贖價全得、亦僅八千元、若輩費用甚巨、故此案尚須虧本、</p>
<p>李已來滬　張何兩票贖欵解决、匪首即放李希庭、先由匪首派一匪盗、引李下山、代雇一漁船、將李押居船底、上用漁網壓身、不令其知路徑、送到汕頭上陸、復由匪贈給川資、在汕代雇長途車票、接至廣九路車站、令其自購車票、至港一切費用、均由匪首交給、在港稍留一二日、李即乘太古公司輪到滬、現已安抵上海、仍回華昌泰服職、言張正宇何西崽不久亦可到來矣、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>他這樣的説着，就走到井邊去。放下一隻籐簍，那滑車嚕嚮上一陣，直把整大捲的繩索都放完了，那老人才轉着滑車的扶手，約莫有一分鐘之久，轉起那隻籐簍來。志前也是好奇心重，要看這井如何的深，竟會放下這一大捲繩子去。走到井口向裏看時裏面却是黑沉沉的，看不到底。那老人兩手捧了籐簍子，就待舉起來喝。志前道；這水淸嗎？怎麽不能喝呢？那老人放下籐簍，就將地上的瓦碗，舀了一大碗給志前看，伸着手笑道；這樣的水，你們喝嗎？志前看時，那碗裏的水，黄黄的，還有些細絲般的雜物，飄在面上，却是看不到碗底。便道：有這樣渾，你們平常都是喝這個嗎？老人微笑點點頭。志前道：呀！我今天才知水這樣不好。這真有碍衛生啦。老人笑道：這個你老爺放心。你們喝的，那都是西關的水。這小西天每個月喝水的錢就是一百多塊呢。他説着，端起那碗來，又待要喝。志前連連摇着手道：你不必喝這個了。凉水本來就不能亂喝，這樣的水，凉的更是喝不得。你不舒服的人，仔細喝着病上加病。你既説我喝的西關水，我房間裏有熱茶，可以去喝兩碗。那老人望着他笑道：老爺，我怎好？他停頓了，説不下去。程志前笑道：你是瓦匠，我是教畫匠，用不着客氣，來。那老工人倒不在乎喝他這口茶，覺得他這個人和氣勁兒，雖不能和他交個朋友，和他談幾句，也是快活的。果然就跟着他後面到他房間外來。走到房門口，他就停止了。志前招着手道：你進來呀？不要緊的。（五七）</p>

<h3>龍飛快</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>來往蘇山之間的航船，在我們東山人都呌它「龍飛快」因為它比普通的航船快，開行時船梢與船頭兩面用四支櫓，遇到順風是掛帆再加櫓摇，所以小火輪也比不上它，它的路是打胥口木瀆而岀太湖走着直徑到東山，不比小火輪灣灣曲曲地走那條内江，時間上可節省多多。</p>
<p>東山一切吃的用的都可託「龍飛快」上帶買的，船上很忠實的會給你如數辦到，他們很歡迎你去託他們帶東西，他們可向店家拿一些回扣之外，又多少可向託帶的人取些「水脚，」所以他們的船開回一次山，總是裝得重要的。</p>
<p>在小火輪没有行駛的時候，「龍飛快」的生意實在不錯，非但託帶貨物，並且往來的旅客亦必定要趁他們的船，對於趁客也優待得很，收了你四毛小洋船資還有一餐兩葷一素的午飯供給，假使你坐在船裏悶，船裏常備着「横涇燒酒」賣給你喝，不歡迎喝酒的在艙裏可躺一𥇰，所以旅客雖然擠在這末低低的船艙裏，倒也不覺得旅途上的寂寞。</p>
<p>現在可就兩樣了，他們小火輪與小火輪的生意亦競争得很厲害，由一艘而到了三艘，票價大家售低，像去年坐「烟棚」只要小洋兩角，而且設備也比較周到，坐位也舒服，「龍飛快」是望塵莫及，自然將要被淘汰掉了。</p>
<p>「龍飛快」所希望的，最好遇到發大水或旱災，小火輪水小不能行而水大亦不能過，吸水淺與過橋洞兩方面都妨碍它的行走，像今年夏的大旱，「龍飛快」做到了一筆好生意，就是遇到十分水淺的地方船行不動，他們會把船背着縴或下水拔一段，不過船資是漲一點，每客須大洋一元，午飯也要外加了，然而，畢竟這生意不是常常的，逞閙災的時候做些生意也實在太可憐了。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （汪瘦秋）</p>
<p>假如有人看到把四萬萬元的鈔幣，送到火裏燒掉的時候，無論是守財奴，或是豪士，總要嘆息一聲吧？但是現在我們一刹那的烟火中，！香烟，！每年就要耗費四萬萬元的金錢，怎不見人嘆息一聲呢！</p>
<h3>通海啓三縣災况寫真</h3>
<p>— 慎初</p>
<p>南通海門啓東三縣，向稱樂土，所産米麥粱豆棉花土布，既足自給，且有大量岀口。惟近年以來，農産歉取，副業失敗，民生已不堪聞問，今歳又罹重災，秋穫絶望，鄉民飢寒交廹，隱患之深，非僅三縣民衆，滬上與三縣為鄰，似亦頗多影響也。通海啟三縣轄境，近年水利欠修，水旱忽於防範，農民又墨守成規，不事改良，以致所穫恒不足以糊口。所恃以補助生活者，則在蠶桑與紡織，惟蠶桑事業，以絲價跌落，早歸消滅，即紡織手工業，因土布暢銷地點，淪入僞國範圍，苛加關税，幾值百抽五十，銷路又歸斷絶。是該三縣民生，雖在秋穫豐收，已難乎其仰事俯蓄，况當連年歉收，積重難返之後，今歳先以旱災，繼遭蟲害，而致秋收絶望乎。</p>
<p>海門東部以及啓東全境。農産品幾全為雜糧，今嵗苦旱，赤地千里，收穫全無。海門西部以及南通東南區，以産棉為大宗，夏季天旱，繼則花果徧受蟲害，秋收之時，又復陰雨連綿，僅存花果，亦皆腐爛，棉花收量，每畝僅二三斤，甚或有以兩計者。南通其餘部份。雖尚差勝一籌，但亦僅得三四成收穫，然竟有誤以豐收聞者。</p>
<p>三縣農民，以積歉之餘，已乏蓋藏，在種植雜糧之區，以受旱災，全失收穫，明春食荒，固所不免，即近日啓東北部，以及南通墾牧南區，已有以豆糠果腹者。無怪未及冬防，匪氛已熾，尋至年近春初，必更不堪設想矣。</p>
<p>三縣有識士紳，深以隱患堪虞，已着手辦賑，並擬開闢中心河以資救濟。中心河者，為横貫通海啓三縣便利交通灌溉之巨河，二十年前，邑紳劉惠定創議興築，惜具芻議，天奪此老，未竟厥功。當此災饉之際，續舉偉業，不僅饑寒交廹之農民，得有衣食，亦足為三縣民衆垂千百年之庥也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>毁滅的前夜</h3>
<p>— 月</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后雖然已在門外給那十六名太監抬進來了，可是一忽兒却還不得就到，於是我便凑着在跪候伊老人家的時候，又偷眼向四面張望了一回。這一次的張望，已比先前更淸楚些了：我看那幾座大建築物的外形，雖和北京有些異樣，但顯然已曾受過一番改造的工夫，不再像是幾百年前的舊宫殿了。這一番改造和翻新的工夫，也都是乾隆皇帝當日所規劃的。我們見了他的手澤，而便不禁要緬想這位英明淸正的大政治家的文才和武略，發生一種熱烈的仰慕。</p>
<p>隔了十分鐘模樣，太后的鸞輿已打正中那一扇大門裏慢慢地抬進來了，沉悶而單調的古樂，兀自在吹打着；但空氣是格外的嚴肅了，像一個人獨自在荒凉的古廟裏，向一尊狰獰可怖的神像膜拜一樣。其莊嚴肅穆的情狀，實非筆墨所能形容。我們但聽一陣悉悉索索的脚步聲在石階上響動，便知道鸞輿已快升殿了；可是大家都依舊屏聲息氣的俯伏着，誰也不敢抬起眼皮來望一望。接着，又聽見鸞輿着地的聲音，像風吹葉落的聲音一樣的輕。因為那十六名太監都是十二分的謹慎小心，當然不會有大的聲響了。他們把鸞輿歇下肩來之後，慌忙也就近處的空地上跪了下去，形成另外一堆的顔色；而太后的玉趾，便在同時開始踐上了伊的故鄉的土地。</p>
<p>太后在一路進來的時候，想必也不免已打那轎簾的隙縫裏窺看過，但伊所能窺見的，當然是很少很不淸楚的；因此伊老人家一下了輿，便站住着身子，用一種非常關切的神態，盡量向四面八方流覧着。（一六七）</p>
<h3>我們纔是東洋人</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>友輩閒談之間，偶然講起東洋人—日本人。一位朋友説：「稱日本人為東洋人，是根本錯誤的。」我以為日本人向來都稱東洋人的，為什麽不對呢？不免要辯論一番。</p>
<p>最後，辯論的終結，我認為勝利應該屬於朋友的；因為他的説數，是有根據而且有理由的。他説：「在讀書時代，曾聽經學兼地理教師姚明煇先生講過西洋和東洋是對等的名稱，中國地大物博，應為東洋的主人翁，日本渺小的島國，不足代表東洋的資格。所以中國人稱為東洋人才對；如果，獨讓日本稱為東洋人，那是絶對不對的。」那末，我們都應稱為東洋人以自豪，不該放棄權利，而讓東洋人佔去便宜了。</p>
<p>朋友又連帶講起姚明煇先生所戴的帽子上，總寫着「太平洋人」四個字。度其用意，是何等的廣闊，以為太平洋畔的霸權，惟我中國可以獨攬啊。</p>
<p>而今渺小的日本人的氣燄怎樣？太平洋的形勢又怎樣？未免使理想中的主人翁的我們，慨嘆不置吧！</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>湖筆</h3>
<p>— 病鴛</p>
<p>筆岀在浙江湖州的，即世俗名之為「湖筆」，已有悠久歷史，和偉大聲名！但所産祗皆兼毫，而無羊毫。自從那智永和尚發明以純粹羊毫製筆之後，於是羊毫筆在湖州，又開了有價值的紀錄。按智永在當日是卓錫於湖州善連鎮永勝寺中，所以直到今日，善連鎮還是以産筆著名。製筆作坊，鱗次櫛比，觸目皆是。大約該鎮居户，以製筆為生的，十家之中，就有五家。莫要小覷了這小小生産事業，它在我國輕工業中，的確佔有很大的地位呢。近年來各地都高喊着農村破産，生計滅絶，獨有這筆業，幸而還没有現岀狼狽情形。即以善連鎮一地而論：每年届岀貨之季，各地莊家和小販，紛紛而來採辦，其市塲勝况，以較從前，似尚無甚差别。</p>
<p>兼毫，係用兎毛和羊毛，合配而製成的。其原料兎羊，均取索於楓涇，嘉善，嘉興，石湖蕩，周王廟，王店，斜橋，長安，許村，臨平各地。因為上述各地方所岀産之羊兎，實優於岀處，且尤宜於製筆。據説：每製筆一枝，必須經過二三十次之手續。其法：關於整理兎毛，大概先取生毛，泡沸水中，使柔馴，提岀，以特製之梳梳之，然後刀切之。若為羊毛，則於同樣整理後，必再以水蒸之，俟刀切齊，分其層次，裹之以紙，摘之使匀，修之務净；中間復用小烙鐵燒紅，細燙毫根，排疊平舒，無力再捲，察其火候，恰到好處，即注膠毫端，而一筆之大功，至此始告初成。所以凡屬精筆，稱作，「宿」字的，即言其「宿垢」已經去盡無存了。無論羊毛兎毛，其生性均為捲曲，并帶反彈力。若欲求其舒直柔馴，作書時，能隨腕指揮，則全在製造之「泡」「蒸」「修」「燙」之上。功夫愈深，岀筆就愈精良！</p>
<p>筆類繁多，除掉兎毫之外，尚有貂狼鷄等毫，亦屬大宗製筆之用；不過均要摻雜羊毛，方能合宜。兎毛之色，則有黑白灰三種之分；筆中有稱作「紫毫」的，那就是黑兎毛所製，其性質亦比他色的為挺硬。而兎毛之形，又有方扁和三角之别。三角形的，絶對不適合製筆。設若在一枝筆中，竟無意摻入三角式的毛，且祗須一根，那麽這枝筆，任憑是如何精製的，已成為廢物。即便强雜於大宗中銷售，而被一不幸的顧主購去，他在寫字時，必大受影響！俗語説：「善書者不擇筆，」這話我認為不能成立。須知「工欲善事，必先利器」，不但是作書，這才是中肯的教訓呢？所以製筆者，對於三角式的兎毛，是深惡痛絶，在取材之際，要下十分的功夫，揀剔考察。但甄别之法，也不過全憑目力而已。</p>
<p>關於筆業，却有大小兩行。製大字筆的原料，多取材於猪鬃和馬鬃。惟製大筆者，不能造小筆，造小筆的，又不會製大筆，這是毫無疑義的。若湖筆，則屬於小字筆一行，他們對製大字筆，也是素不相謀。記得在淸代光緒年間，有個日本人，深慕中國的毛筆，尤慕湖筆，製造絶精。他特地親赴我國浙省善連鎮，專心一意，造訪某一家筆作，陳以甘辭，奉上厚幣，請求學習製造之法。該作坊却也不好意思拒絶，就收了他三百元，答應教授。此日人祗學了三四個月，對一切情形，早皆了然於胸。不過東洋人為世界上最深心的民族，他還恐此家作坊，未能盡傳其秘。居常無事，就闖東家，跑西家，希圖暗中考察。然而終於莫得金針之度，無可奈何，祗好廢然而去！</p>

<h3>麥倫中學勞力運動</h3>
<p>完成偉大工程　舉行演説比賽</p>
<p>上海兆豐路麥倫中學、年來實施「活的教育」、提倡勞心勞力之合作、上星期舉行「勞力運動週」、舉辦（一）勞力講座、由劉菓蘩傅淸淮唐希賢諸氏演講、（二）全校師生整潔比賽、（三）級際勞力演講比賽、由朱懋澄王其培沈體蘭諸氏評判、結果高中第一名田常青、初中第一名嚴孝森、（四）各班由導師領導進行勞力工程、計高三高二各築磚路一條、高一初三各修跑道一圏、初二甲修理全校竹籬、初二乙組填平操塲、初一甲組搬運全校各處垃圾、初一乙組掃淸全校操塲、精神十分飽滿、成績甚佳、前日晨由英人畢禮克、校工張富明、評判以高一初三兩班工程最為偉大、於星期一紀念週時、分發奬品、以資鼓勵云、</p>
<h3>教育部最近改進專科以上學校要點（六）</h3>
<p>照右表二十一年度文類畢業生較二十年度减少百分之零·八、實類畢業生較二十年度增加百分之零八、分析來説、二十一年度除文商兩科畢業生較二十年度增加外、法科及教育科畢業生、均有减少、並且减少的百分數還很大、實類畢業生、理科與醫科、均較二十年度增加、農科工科雖减少、可是减少的百分數却是很小、於此可以證明、文類畢業生確有减少的趨勢、實類畢業生確有增加的趨勢、不過所增加和减少的數量並不大、這裏我們要聲明的、就是二十一年度的畢業生、都是幾年以前入學的、所以文類畢業生减少並不多、實類畢業生增加亦不多、如再過幾年全國的文類畢業生一定比現在减少很多、實類畢業生一定增加很多、因為我們要以畢業生一項來看注重實科和限制文法科的效力、一定要再過幾年、等現在的學生畢了業、方可以看得岀來、</p>
<p>最後就新生來説、二十一年度各校錄取新生總數為一萬零三百五十二人、二十二年度為一萬零九百一十人、其科别如左表、</p>
<p>科别　二十一年度　二十二年度　二十二年度比二十一年度增减數</p>
<p>文　　25.2％　　　26.2％　　　＋1.0％</p>
<p>法　　23.2％　　　21.0％　　　－2.2％</p>
<p>教育　　9.9％　　　　7.7％　　　－2.2％</p>
<p>商　　　5.1％　　　　5.3％　　　＋0.2％</p>
<p>合計　60.4％　　　60.2％　　　－3.2％</p>
<p>理　　12.3％　　　17.3％　　　＋4.4％</p>
<p>農　　　4.4％　　　　5.2％　　　＋0.8％</p>
<p>工　　13.3％　　　12.0％　　　－1.3％</p>
<p>醫　　　6.0％　　　　5.3％　　　－0.7％</p>
<p>合計　36.6％　　　39.8％　　　＋3.2％</p>
<p>照名表看來、二十二年度新生、除文科商科較較二十一年度稍有增加外、法科及教育科均各减少百分之二·二、以實類來説、僅工科醫科新生較二十一年度略為减少、理農各科、均較二十一年度增多、而尤以理科增加為最多、綜合來説、二十二年度文類新生較二十一年度减少百分之三·二、實類新生較二十一年度增加百分之三·二、這裏我們更可以證明注重實科和限制文法科的效力了、現在全風學術工作諮詢處正擬詳密調查專科以上學校畢業生就業狀况及各機關團體需才情形、教育部將據以籌畫今後大學各院及各種專科學校之發展或限制、將來招生比額、當即依此而為更詳密的規定</p>
<p>除以上所説的五點而外、尚有重要改進事項數點還須附帶報告的就是、（一）厲行視察、教育部對於專科以上學校、每年例須派員視察、以為改進的根據、本年四月起、曾先後選派專家十餘人、將專科以上學校、作通盤的視察、以期獲得整個的改進計畫、視察方法、採取分科視察制度、被視察的學校、共計四十餘校、視察時特别注意學生上課缺課情形、教員上課缺課及兼職兼課情形、學校經費分配狀况、學生程度及考試狀况、課程編制、學校紀律、圖書儀器等預備、衛生設備、軍訓及體育狀况等項、現已根據視察報告、分别令飭改進、（二）籌設研究所、教育部為養成高深學術人才及完成最高階段的學制起見、本年曾制定研究所規程公布施行、除北京大學淸華大學中山大學等校已設有研究所令照新章積極整理外、並就國立大學中之辦理已著成績者、籌設各科研究所、現已由部令飭開始籌設者、有中央大學武漢大學等校、（三）補助私立專科以上學校、已在前面充實設備項内略為提及、此次補助費、係於本年春間呈准由國庫年撥七十二萬元、定為私立專科以上學校補助費額、補助標準、注重實科、其贊額不得少於百分之七十、補助項目為設備費及教席費、請求補助者共四十一校、經審查委員會嚴密審核後、决定補助者三十二校、以科别言、理農工醫等科佔百分之八○·七、文法商教育等科佔百分之一九·三、以費别言、設備費佔百分之八一·五、教席費佔百分之一八·五、此外如飭聘校外委員參加畢業考試、改良訓育及軍事訓練辦法、督促各校注重本國實際問題之研究、取締成績不良之私立專科以上學校、均經分别見諸實施、此地也不必多説了、不過我們從上面各點看起來、全國專科以上學校、可説是已有相當的進步、但是這種進步、並不見得若何大若何速、還有一屑、數量上的進步、是從平均數方面得來的、質量上的進步、是從大體上視察得來的、若是個别的看地來、數量和質量上的進步、更加參差不齊了、所以教育部目前的主要工作、是要使平均的進步加大加速、同時使個别的進步、也漸漸趨於整齊、而毫無進步希望的學校、仍要繼續加以取締、進個可説是教育部今後改進專科以上學校的中心工作、（完）</p>

<h3>現實典型及其他</h3>
<p>— 野</p>
<p>辛人先生在其「典型與現實」一文中，把藝術作品之所具有典型和非有不可的原因，歸之於藝術和開末拉之不同處即藝術底特殊性—「…在這里藝術有着偉大的，啓蒙的教育的力量，藝術並非少數人底消閒玩物，而是大多數人的最珍貴的精神底食糧，因此之故，倘若藝術不典型化，那末牠只是抄寫浮面的現象，只是寫岀「河面的泡沬，」不能表現「河底的巨流；」結果流於現實底歪曲，或現實的單純化，機械化。這樣的藝術是有毒的東西，或是䘮失啓蒙的教育的力量，同時也就䃸失了為藝術底資格。」我以為這段話是相當混亂的，這段話用之於藝術底社會價值的評價則可，用之於為什麽藝術作品具有典型和非具有不可這一問題上，至少也是不很恰當的。</p>
<p>我的意思這樣；客觀的現實是多面性的，同時也是典型底的；在這些多面性中也就存有最本質的（典型底的）若干面在，藝術為着要抓住現實底本質，那麽牠最非深入其核心，緊抓住現實底多面性中最本質底的，也即是最典型底的因素不可，於是，藝術底典型化，也正是形象的地被表現於其中，且為其基礎的，現實底典型反映。也只有做過這一點，那作品才是本質底現實性底的，藝術底典型化，並不是也不能是為了保持或提高的啓蒙的教育的作用才成立的；相反地，每一偉大的劃時代的作品，都是典型底的，為的牠通過形象而表現了特定歷史階段上客觀現實底本質（現實底多面性中之最具典型性的方面，藝術底非典型化或類型化，這原因不僅在作家底藝術才能和表現的不足，同時也是作家對於現實生活底膚淺的皮相的理解所致，作家對於現實於認識方法，跟現實之文學的再現底方法，兩者雖然不是同一的，然而這其間之存在着統一的聯繫，該是自明的事實吧。因而在文學批評上我們不但要檢討或一作品底形式技巧在表現上的效果即其積極性；同時也得檢討創作底實踐本身，即，那作品曾否正確地反映活生生的客觀的現實，在這一反映過程上作家底世界觀是助長了這一現實底文學的再現呢，還是朦糊了以至於歪曲了這一表現。俺得説，真正的哲學者底世界觀是包含着極少矛盾的，那麽，最偉大的藝術家也該是完滿地獲得其世界觀跟創作方法的統一者吧。</p>
<h3>急灘舟</h3>
<p>— 柳凡</p>
<p>如果旅行過長江上游，如果搭過川江輪的話，誰都知道有名的淸灘吧！從宜昌起，河面就漸漸地開始狹窄起來，兩岸的山峯像决鬥樣向河中間擠，越走進去，越擠得緊；河面被逼得只一線了，水更急流着，似挣扎，又似忿怒，因為很遠地就聽到了水的吼聲。</p>
<p>於是，輪船一次又一次地拉着長哨；這哨聲，在萬山中不斷地比原來更大聲地回響着。前者是警告船員，後者似乎是在鼓勵輪船的前進。機器間的警鐘在響，工人們很小心地檢視機器，開足馬力，加油；全班水手動員，在船頭上用長竹竿量兩旁的水，大聲喊着水的深度，并隨時報告着刻在山石上的水標。台上的領江，縮小了自己的心，左望望，右望望，站起來，坐下，敏捷地旋轉着策定方向的輪盤。</p>
<p>輪船像「分水牛」樣，分着水路前進，水却像頑皮小孩，拚命地猛樸船頭，跑上甲板，一瞬，把船頭吞了，跟着又吐岀來，又吞，又吐，……威嚇發着巨哮，又帶誘惑性的幻現岀白的浪花。總之，她是用全力在阻止輪船的前進。</p>
<p>當心；水中全是人目看不見的亂石，只要一碰，一碰就够了，不是船立刻撞破，至少也有個大洞，或許大得不可收拾，因而沉没，小也弄得手忙脚亂，飽喫虚驚，打上灘去，固然要費些氣力，説不定撞在三尖石上，了此一船；但既到灘頭，要退下來，更不容易。常常有船不上不下，左右兩難，因此撞沉的也着實不少，</p>
<p>冬麽險急的灘，冬麽大的水聲，可又冬麽好看的浪花啊，許冬船望着這洶湧澎湃的灘頭，遲疑着不敢前進，許多船碰在灘石上沉没了，更有許多船勇毅地打過灘去。却從没有，從没有一隻船久持着灘上不動：</p>
<p>我記得有一次，在軍隊裏，是打敗仗吧，我們的船在淸灘曾打了六個鐘頭的上水，好容易才拚上去。縁因是大領江生病，二領江代行職務，當然在技術方面「推扳」一些，最糟的是船裏最主要的機器「車葉子，」壞了一個，船的馬力，更减少許多。這時，全船的人都跑岀艙面來了，全都望着這掀天地水勢發愁，四面都是水聲，一個接一個地浪頭迎面打來，被攻擊着的船身，不能前進一步，因為這時的水力恰和船力相抵。船發氣了，機器更激烈地震動着，努力向上衝；到半中腰，又退了回來，連衝連退，究因了船力太薄，不能順利地衝過這險惡的灘頭。</p>
<p>忿怒抓住船上每個人的心，大家都埋怨領江的失職，有些人竟想離船走去，他們對領則絶望了，以為始終没有打過這難灘的可能，而且這灘尚離我們目的地（川中）還遠。在我心裏那時却起了個滑稽的念頭，我恨水，我覺得水不是不明白有了熟識航路的領江，任你用怎樣大的力，也無法阻撓的，况這輪船必經過這灘，一百個灘，達到她要達到的目的地，雖然一不小心，便會撞破，雖然許會耽誤她的航程；但最終仍必要達到她的要達到的處所。因為過多的人，非走此路便死，况根本只有此路可通！我一面望着頑固地發瘋般圍攻着上灘船的水，一面瞎想着這幼稚而可笑的心思，我忘記了水性的向下，她仇視着，抵抗着任何向上的東西，縱便抵抗是徒勞無益！</p>
<p>領江改變航路了，并命令着所有的水手和許多船客，在船頭上跳，這樣可以减少水的來勢，同時加强了船身的抵抗力。終於從右側方打上灘去了。</p>
<p>這使我得到一個教訓。航路，領江，機器，在船的進行上都起着巨大的作用，更認識了急灘的舟，不進則退。</p>
<p>人生旅途上，想不會兩樣吧！</p>
<h3>窮</h3>
<p>— 周龍光</p>
<p>我認為拿「窮」字來做題目，這篇文章，有許多人，都無從下手，不是過來人，説來也不切題；不是在「窮」字中，翻過無量數觔斗的人，説來也不動聽；我自然是個内行了，但是「窮」，是弱者的悲吟，中國社會上的心理，是「憎人富貴惡人窮」的，你就説到怎樣的可憐！悽慘！别人反咒你「自作孽」，根本博不到同情心，還是不説的好。</p>
<p>記得敝鄉從前有某甲刻自著的專集，書前的叙文，自叙他幼年的「窮」苦，有這樣幾句道：「陶士行稱「環堵蕭然，不蔽風雨，」就認為「窮」極了，孰知余僅一斗室，向東之墻，反為暴雨所侵倒，而多年無力補葺。」某甲之處境，還勝我一籌，我連想三面有墻之斗室，亦不可得！舍下（其實早已無舍，姑且借用吧）的斗室，早逢刧火，至今還是寄人籬下，所以我真够得上「窮」的資格，窮得無話可説，勉强借前人的「去年窮，無立錐之地，今年，錐也無。」的陳語來形容吧！</p>
<p>但是為「窮」而悲傷的，原不自我始；唐朝韓退之，已經做過「送窮文」，而退之呌窮，是想官做，他在京師三上宰相之書，説得多麽廹切。然夷考其内容，猶曰：「愈今者，惟朝夕芻米僕賃之資是急！」説來説去，還是因為豢馬和僱用僕人的費用，無從岀着，可見退之不是真窮，他還有馬與僕哩。</p>
<p>三百年前，又岀了一「窮鬼」戴南山。他是真窮，差不多和我現在一樣，但他剛剛活在淸初，「文字獄」正盛，他想做點罵街式的文章，岀岀胸中的氣，也不敢下筆，他只得寫一篇小品文，名曰「窮鬼傳」。内中有一段精彩的道；</p>
<p>「子（指窮鬼）以窮為名，其勢固足以窮余也：議論文章，開口觸忌，則窮于言；上下坑坎。前巔後躓，俯仰跼蹐，左支右吾，則窮于行；蒙塵垢，被刺譏，憂衆口，則窮于辨；所為而拂亂，所往而刺謬，則窮于才；聲勢貨利不足以動衆，磊落孤憤不足以諧俗，則窮于交遊；抱其無用之書，負其不覊之氣，挾其空匱之身，入所厭薄之世，則在家而窮，在邦而窮：」</p>
<p>戴先生是借此，稍稍發洩點憤懣：然而，人窮到「議論文章，開口觸忌，」也真够受了！我平生是不善于發議論的，所以比戴先生痛快些，胸中也没有什麽憤懣。閑來無事，就抱一部「太上感應篇」，或者是「般若波羅密多心經」讀讀，早已忘記「窮」了，不過，最近又接我的老婆的信，説：「天寒了！大孩子没棉衣，小孩子還赤脚，老母親病後，想喝點黄豆湯……」㗒！不看了。我本來忘記「窮」，又讓老婆瞎三話四的，寫了滿紙「窮話」，倘被别人看見，會不理我的，她不知道社會上的心理，都是憎惡窮人的呀，就是「窮」，也得要裝着不「窮」的樣子，這名呌「挺肚裝胖子」，不這樣，便呌你窮得連水都没得喝啦。</p>
<h3>談談木刻（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生</p>
<p>木刻刀主要的是鑿刃其鍊火較辣，我國舊用皆為偏鋒，原始而不靈，故率採用内山書店代售的木柄木刻刀。每具元半者算中上貨色，在國内就要算最良的木刻刀了。每副有五把頭或七把頭不等。七把頭岀手較鋭，五把頭則適合於大寫。故我是並用兩副。此物實際為一種皮肉層劃刀，微與古人木刻用刀有岀入。不過每個從事木刻的人，似宜備有印具，如美（德）貨上等黑印墨；調墨具（片刀，石板）及橡膠滚。印紙以吴淞路××堂木板畫用紙為最善，普通用英國肯特銅板紙亦佳，惟最覺麻煩者，厥為木材，一般用鷄公樹（木）此物我國常少人植，因其質地嫩嫋，既不可作傢具，亦不合當紫燒，滬上因圖章業廣，故有買處，不過每索倍蓰價值。又必託相熟木匠代鉋與介紹木料代買。且改板後即得大小凡二三百塊，安置既苦不便，移動更感麻煩。此外磨刀與石亦須充分研究，絶不能每把皆委之磨刀匠，為要得心應手還是要自家來幹才好（滬戰前第三期東方雜誌載揚州竹刻家楊××先生一文可資借鏡）磨刀主『油磨』便於避銹，因此物形多，每有僻當銹澀，即須想盡方法才能復原（一般是將石磨成各型以適刀位）。石以五金舖之德製人造剃刀石為善，外則須具粗（沙石）細（青石）嫩（羊肝石）各程度石，刻板採舊法須上油，烘後開刀，甚妙。生手磨刀應注意避免手尖磨傷。刀之最考究者，必先利其器，以用英國手牌錯刀自製為最。製刀是有各種秘法的。但若初學者以Lino入畫，就不必。</p>
<p>用刀亦有種種秘法，舊走人物大多視若家珍不肯傳授我等。（中國為木刻始祖，木刻反見没落亦以此）我在專攻木刻之一年餘中所得很可憐，因為教的人太半都是無科學頭腦之輩，要教亦不合教授法。木刻比較漫畫難，但比漫畫給人的興趣還要來得濃。所以我們要决心去研究時，困難種種都需要解决或避免的</p>
<p>。現時青年藝人每執全牛一毛之法，都閉户埋頭苦幹，不願進而公開討論技術問題實足阻塞木刻之前途和造境，故敢率爾操觚以引起國中木刻藝人，方家，大雅之注意，或可望抛磚之效也。無疑的：今之木刻，等於前幾年的漫畫，會有像現在的漫畫界一樣發達起來的時候的。</p>

<p>劉：我想舖板可以不用拿岀去，王掌櫃，你拿岀去不也是没有地方放嗎？</p>
<p>掌：那不是變了我白借給你們錢嗎？</p>
<p>劉：不過借錢那有這樣大利息？我們得還你一付舖板呢？</p>
<p>（夥計上，交錢後即下，掌櫃接錢交劉。）</p>
<p>卜：王掌櫃是最好俠義的，反正我們一有錢就還你兩付新舖板呢？</p>
<p>掌：好吧！</p>
<p>劉：夥計（夥計上）把舖板搬岀去！（夥計搬舖板下，掌櫃也助着而下。）</p>
<p>韓：非打倒不行！</p>
<p>劉：已經被我的智力打倒了！</p>
<p>韓：要澈底打倒非用我拳頭不行！</p>
<p>劉：老韓！你别夢想，是需要智慧的。</p>
<p>卜：朋友，别閙啦！快收拾吧，用智慧也好，用拳頭也好，總之戀愛尚未成功，革命是不能努力的！</p>
<p>（大概已收拾就結了。夥計上。）</p>
<p>夥：卜先生，有位小姐來找你，</p>
<p>（劉作腔）</p>
<p>卜：我們快岀去，讓老韓在這兒辦第三步。夥計！請張小姐進來吧！（卜劉下）</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>公債市塲花樣多九六突漲一元許</p>
<p>惟收盤近遠忽現倒掛</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、因盤旋過久、忽起變動、金融界某某大銀行、每盤均有買進、北帮及甯帮、對於九六、尤感特别興趣、此中消息如何、已與前各次謡傳整理不同、當然别有作用、觀各帮之奮勇收買、似非無的之矢、表面情形、或有整六高漲之後、連帶提高、且其價格低小、易於入手、故九六此次之漲、其情形又與前數次兩途、或尚有繼續增高之可能、然亦難説、九六之整理、不是一件易事、即使整理、所好亦祗少數、故前途如何、祗局中人自知之、昨日經過、上午開盤、整六不因隔日漲上獨多而示弱竟又猛漲半元、可見此項公債、空頭實多、而其現貨究屬有限也、次盤繼續上漲一二角、尚屬平穩、此時塲上、即有九六看高之傳説、故午後開盤、九六猛漲四角半、整六亦續好三角半、收盤整六竟穿岀七十元大關、九六再漲四角半、惟漲時檯面多頭搶帽子等、均恐復蹈前次覆輙、紛紛了結、故本月漲四角半、下月祗好五分、已成倒掛之局面市價結果、計漲起數角至一元有零、成交總數、計共約二千萬元左右、兹將其漲跌情形、列表於後、（單位元）</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>加税利於做多標紗續呈堅硬狀</p>
<p>標紗市續堅、形勢穩定、海外棉業狀况平靜、現紗銷路尚暢、廣東内地兩帮進胃頗健、買方議論、謂各廠存底較前抽空不少、因之新費户束手、兼之增加統税一事、尚未决定、致人無飄摇不定云、</p>
<p>金鷄又好八九角　標紗前市開盤、因塲中賣户缺乏、而增加統税一事、多説利於多頭、故市氣堅挺、各月均漲四·六·七·八角、午後聞現紗銷路良好、仍有一千五百包、且售價趨漲、故賣户缺乏、各月均漲一·二·四角、全日成交統計三萬六千包、查賣岀大孚七百五十包、通記六百包、穗隆一千包、錦昌四百包、振大四百包、泰興六百包、均昶九百包、恒德六百包、益昶六百包、潤康七百五十包、大昶八百包、源大一千零五十包、元德五百包、信誠五百包、買進大豐一千包、賡豐七百包、大福六百包、慎記八百五十包、同興四百五十包、長豐二千三百五十包、達記一千包、森康七百包、元一二千二百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>紗銷做至一千五百包　現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮買去統計一千五百包、行情漲五角至一元光景、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市抵空尚殷</p>
<p>棉市趨堅、因各路來源不旺、而漢埠消息、市價報漲、致多路活動、金價堅穩、惟外棉疲弱、紗市堅挺、致人心稍昂、散空抵補者較衆、然現棉消費不暢云、</p>
<p>鄭標好二角半　標棉前市開盤、市氣甚緊、塲中買風較濃因散空抵補而堅後以大户抛岀、略見回下、結果各月均漲二·三·四角、午後獲利者了結、致檯面略鬆、各月回跌五分至一二角、全日成交統計六萬七千七百擔、查賣岀通記一千七百擔、大豐二千三百擔、源大三千四百擔、泰興一千一百擔、賡豐四千八百擔、恊生一千三百擔、信誠四千一百擔、德記一千一百擔、源興昌一千一百擔、長和二千四百擔、長豐二千三百擔、大昶一千一百擔、買進裕大一千七百擔、慎昌四千一百擔、慎記三千七百擔、長豐四千二百擔、潤康一萬零二百擔、同和二千五百担、益豐一千一百担、一日間最低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉廠需不旺　現棉銷路依然平滯、廠需不旺、來源計姚花二百六十六包、通花七百五十包云、</p>
<p>印度棉區天氣不利</p>
<p>上週棉市、自停市以後、因棉區天氣報告不利、即行步昂、蓋棉區雖需雨水、但如最近之大陣雨、頗有損害棉質之慮也、週内成交、較平均减少、大致高價時多頭脱手、跌價時運輸商買進、現貨市况無特色、廠家略有進意、遠東頗見活動、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>米價步昂中期粉麥漲勢連續</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼漲之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回小一二角左右、故開價時、市氣曾見疲滯、較之前週收價、相差無幾、旋以津帮略有遠期生意、而日來米價、又復步昂、致人心良好、喊價步高、迨至下午開盤、市氣繼續俏利、廠家祗聞福新略岀、餘則不動、又以米價之故、内地帮頗有吸收、故交易雖未大暢、市面則有繼漲增高之勢也、結果本月份至一月份各漲三分二釐半、二月份好三分半、三月份漲三分七釐半、四月份漲四分、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈穩固之象、以洋麥報價、雖芝加哥坎拿大均小一二角左右、惟現洋麥之報價、則洋行方面、未有活動、因此市塲抛户甚稀、買户則頗急切、各月份喊價、遂好二三分之譜、迨至下午開價、以粉市之回振、及米價之欣欣向榮、抛户愈稀、漲度又覺可觀、此種情形、將來非得國外之接濟、市面有易漲難跌之勢也、結果本月份漲六分、十二月份漲八分、一月份漲一角、二月份漲九分、三月份開至四元一角四分、較之前週初開時、計好一角半、現麥因廠胃停頓、擯住未開、</p>
<p>澳洲蟲患更劇、國外市况挺秀、故支加哥雜糧開盤緊穩、但一般對於國外雜糧進口之競争、不無恐懼、加以週末軋平小麥市價於是下跌、</p>
<p>洋米成交六千噸</p>
<p>客米成交近七千包開價漲起半元以上</p>
<p>無錫帮亦採辦客秈</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、一致上騰、交易尤見熱閙、期洋麥晨間開價尚低、後被内地本街争辦、價亦激漲角半、統市由永大公司抛岀三月份四百噸、價祗五元二角、後由達孚岀三月份一千噸、價已至五元三角二分、合義岀一千二百噸、又漲二分、為五元三角四分矣、福家岀一千噸、扯五元三角三分、二月份由達孚岀一千噸、價址五元二角八分、永大公司即裝四百噸、價五元一角半、合義十一、十二月期五百噸、價五元一角八分、其他回籠與了結者、亦有五六百噸、價亦相似、總計成交達六千噸有零、現洋米開西貫五千包、特高貨價至十一元六角、大市貨亦至十一元三角、比之上週末較漲四五角、</p>
<p>客秈昨日到頭不多、消化甚活、尤以内地帮最貪、無錫帮與本街争辦、價乃激漲半元以上、全市開岀六千八百五十六包、</p>
<p>厚新粳猛漲半元</p>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源轉多、計到四十餘號（貨共六千餘石）、其市况自前日轉向後、昨開手即有帶緊之象、及至後市天雨忽滂沱不止、人心特起重大之變化、售方喊聲驟見緊張、形勢紊亂、本街銷化既活、故雖客帮包胃祗青島　辦二百餘包、而如各色晚稻價繼能上升二三角、若野白稻等厚新粳、際此需要起色、計行情猛騰有半元之譜、餘外杜洋尖等及陰變元各花色俱隨帶起二三尺不等、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到埠十三四號、河存日稀、只七八十艘、市銷新粳破粳薄稻新陳白元陰元零胃不甚緊俏、新羊杜尖新陳埠客尖略化、市形新粳高貨價漲二三角、中次加三四角、破粳新羊尖加二角外、新陳白元陰元新杜尖新陳埠客尖薄稻價形亦加二三角、</p>
<p>黄豆行情升漲角外</p>
<p>昨日黄豆市價、比較上週末須漲角外、原因（一）因無錫産米區蒞本市採辨大批洋客秈米、（二）因産價日高、（三）因去路活潑、所以市氣激漲統市成交車輪各豆有七八千包、銷胃推内地本街多數、福州泉州次之、廠家辦去穎州陳豆兩車、價做三元、浦東杜豆來源仍稀、市價亦見回升、昨開四元九角八至五元、共祗交易五十餘包、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>本綿白又跌一角</p>
<p>日糖暗中進岀頗熱閙</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金無甚上落、趨勢平平、公會划盤二四粗砂白、現貨普通十八元七角半、本棧貨十八元八角半、均乏變動、轉口貨呌漲乏受、仍划五元四角二分、荷赤無上落、亦無成交、本廠綿白、續見疲跌、振裕一號又小一角、為十六元九角、振記一號呌十七元一角、未成、查本綿白長疲短俏、完全為劣貨活動所致、邇來公會交見雖未公開、但暗中進岀頗為熱閙、糖業昔日本有糖子子之譽、今如是行動、故公會方面、昨接得某方警告函、未知業此者亦有動於中否、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>木耳地價猛漲不已</p>
<p>亳紅棗升起三角</p>
<p>木耳邇來漢市因有江西帮不問價之高低、依市採辦、步步騰漲、昨電興安耳又漲三元許、為九十一元八角、划申已近百○七元、而魁耳更緊、竟升至一百二十八元、划申須一百四十餘元、看勢尚有續緊意、此間行盤、鼎盛航空牌小包耳呌一百○五元、勢亦堅緊、亳州紅棗前以到多關係曾小至七元二角、行方以價到低盤、頗有進胃、昨日開價已回升三角、開七元半、成交二三百包、售價隨升、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>婦女喜穿駝色呢大衣</p>
<p>女色大衣呢、邇來生意大好、二十元上下一件大衣、銷路尤暢、因之四元左右普通女大衣呢走銷日廣、駝色今庚頗為時行、普通法蘭羢均須開售五元模樣、絲點女大衣呢為五元六角半、人字波浪形為四元五角、各式斜花均為五元净盤、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>紅緑茶交易均稀</p>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、轉趨沉靜、各歐莊均以上星期發岀大批電報、尚未回音、多持觀望態度、全市僅祗恊和福時天祥等行、買進珍眉針眉兩項緑茶、共計四百餘箱、售價較前無漲跌、至珠茶貢熙等貨、及祁門兩湖紅茶、交易均趨寥落、市况漸形衰淡、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>青鉛本街交易獨旺</p>
<p>青鉛交易、久告寂寞、近來已有轉機氣象、蓋本街油漆公司黄丹廠等均有鉅量辦去、而印書房製造廠等亦有點綴、故市上買賣尚稱熱閙、惟岀口生意不見發動、行情每担售十五元、而喝價亦有要十五元二角半者、昨雖天雨、查開岀仍有七八百條之多、聞同業之批岀者、多為法租界一帶五金號、而北蘇州路五金號則祗少許售岀云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>自謙果然是美德麽？</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>前天讀了「龍」先生的「自負」一文，不免動了我「處世藝術」不易之感。</p>
<p>「自負」便是「驕傲，」「驕傲」果然不好，但自負的反面，便是「自謙，」但「自謙」果然是美德麽？我到也不敢説，因為過於「自謙」的人，在歷史上看來，毛病岀得很多：「王莽謙恭下士，」「王安石累徵不起，」這樣矯揉造作的人，結果閙岀了許多大亂子。</p>
<p>即如肥水之捷，「謝安得驛書，方與客圍棋，攝書置牀上，了無喜色，圍棋如故，客問之，徐答曰。小兒輩遂已破賊，既罷還内，過户限，不覺屐齒之折，」謝安雖未曾閙岀甚麽亂子，但他故示鎮靜，「太不自負」的樣子，也未免不近人情，所以作史的人，描寫他作僞的態度，就在那「屐齒之折」四字中，把謝安心急如火，得意忘形的神情，完全表現岀來，我想「自負」的人，到還比「自謙」的好些，真是「僞君子不若真小人」。</p>
<p>天下的文章，厄拉浙江最好，浙江的文章，厄拉紹興最好，紹興的文章，厄拉家兄最好，家兄的文章，還要小弟筆削筆削，這是紹興人相傳的妙語。</p>
<p>又如「鄧艾口吃，語稱艾艾，晋文王戲之曰，艾艾為是幾艾，對曰，鳯兮，鳯兮，故是一鳯，」又如「陸雲與荀鳴鶴素未相識，甞會張華坐，華曰，今日相遇，勿作常談，雲因抗手曰，雲間陸土龍。荀曰，日下荀鳴鶴。」抗手二字，明明寫岀陸士龍驕傲的樣子，猶如上海的白相人，往往把胸堂一拍，大指一豎，同一神情。</p>
<p>這樣心直口快，毫不客氣的人，我雖是十分相信，因為他肚子裏什麽，一説岀來也是什麽，表演岀來的也是什麽，但是從傍人聽來，總覺得過於吹牛，有些刺耳，到底也不合「處世的藝術，」這樣「自謙」不好，「自負」也不好，究竟怎樣一種態度，方才算得不抗不卑，盡得中庸的道呢？</p>
<p>唐朝的李林甫，人稱他是「蜜口刀心。」就是我們俗語所説的「嘴裏撈岀糖來，心裏摸岀刀來」同一説法，推廣一些，就是要「言行不一致，」滿面孔「仁義道德，」滿肚皮「男盗女娼，」一口裏儘管説得怎樣天花亂墜的好聽，做的事情儘</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>可怎樣地惡劣。這就是所謂中庸之道麽？</p>
<p>不，這决非是中庸之道，所謂中庸之道者，就是「八方無碍」「四面調匀」人家説好，我便説是不差，人家説不靈、我説真是豈有此理所謂「和其光了同其塵，」這庶幾可稱為中庸之道而已。因此我便想到中庸之道的兩個標準人物，就寫在下邊，作為結論：</p>
<p>漢京師為請平恩侯許伯入第，丞相御示將軍中二千石皆賀，酒甜樂作，長信少府擅長卿起舞，為沐猴與狗鬥。坐皆大笑。</p>
<p>宋韓伲冑，嘗與家客游南園，過山莊，顧竹籬茅舍曰，此真田舍間氣象，但少鷄鳴犬吠耳，俄聞犬嘷叢薄，視之乃師鐸也，伲冑大笑。</p>
<h3>唐山毒死五百人</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>八十年前林則徐關於禁吸鴉片的奏摺有云：「若不施禁，數十年後，匪特無可歛之財，且無可練之兵」，對於「阿芙蓉」蠱害人民之弊，言之極為闢透。牠（櫻粟）之影響於國家民族者，不僅在於消極的荒時廢業，而且在於積標的弱民弱國；這句「鴉片亡國」的警語，徵以而今目下的情形，我想仍然適用。俗話説得好，「㨮刀和烟籖，能挑萬畝田」，因參入烟霞，而盪家破産者有之，毒深致病以死者有之，至若在烟癮的脅廹之下，所産生岀來的社會罪惡，更是難以數計。</p>
<p>可是我門的民族總有這斷不了的劣根性，明知其害，仍然要嗜之成癖，尤其是許多名公巨賈，對待「雲膏」的愛好，髣髴竟成了無「毒」不丈夫一樣。因之上行下效，至於販夫走卒之在「太谷犖犖」旁而送入枉死城者，不知幾許。日帝國主義就利用了這一弱點，來實行牠對中國亡國滅種的大計。「新滿洲」之力行「三毒政策」無論矣，我們且看看隨平瀋通車以俱來的事實。前兩日天津電云：「唐山日洋行林立，毒禍蔓延，受害致死者，為數殊足驚人。公安局呈報，本年一月迄九月，倒斃者二八三人，内毒發身死者一七零人：礦區倒斃者四一零人，毒發身死者三三零人。」</p>
<p>記着！僅唐山一地，九月之中，因毒發而「倒斃」者，已達五百；如以戰區各地，（東北更不用説），兩三年内，以及非「倒斃」而「疾終正寝」者概數計之，其數之「驚人」，尚可想及？軍用汽車所載「特貨」一輛一輛的從長城各口進來，朝鮮販毒者的充斥，在在均應引起我們的警惕。試一想及，我國人民於吞雲吐霧中，洋錢成批的送入敵人腰包；既食之後，精神萎靡，意志消沈，子子孫孫也不會「反滿抗日」；最後一息俱絶，人死而土歸於人，我們將興若何的感喟？</p>
<p>在我們看見這一血肉糢糊的紀載時，實在没有廣東時賢們救國救民救種（即暗寓搓麻雀抽大烟逛堂子三事）的閒情逸趣：然而在南方各地正在槍斃毒犯之時，又將何以慰這無數毒發倒斃的魂？</p>
<h3>村中雜景</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>六月的天，毒太陽火盆似的燃燒着，天空永遠是一大片藍青，澄淸的，一塊雲朶没有，一點雨意更没有，雨成為珍珠那麽貴重，望天降雨，就彷彿望天落下珍珠一樣。太陽灑到河裏，河水就乾涸，灑到田裏，那緑色的稻苗便化成赤色的枯草，一叢工萎下去，倒下去。那噙住着一個飄渺的希望，同時萎下去了。可是到了後來，連河裏池裏的水也乾竭了。而天老是一大片藍青色，仍没一點雨意，長長的日子了，都是這樣的。</p>
<p>僅有的希望亦宣告破滅了。於是跟着氣候的惡劣，人們的性子都變得非常惡劣起來。</p>
<p>再没有誰想到自己的田，想上田去，就會無端的謾罵着。他們罵着，夫罵别人，也罵自己。而每個人都綳着臉兇很地，像想了一肚皮的氣憤。成天我找人吵閙，逢着一個不對勁，便互相秋起脬子來揍打一陣。有如别人看自己是仇敵一樣的看别人。</p>
<p>好像所有的人們都染了瘋狂症了。男子鎮日價在外頭閙亂子，偶然有了錢全不像平時。那樣把家裏的女人去安家，却去拚命喝酒，喝得醉醺醺的便拐回家，於是女人又哭哀着臉的咕魯什麽，</p>
<p>—你到獨單個子在外邊尋快活，家裏不管了，明天没米下鍋了，知道了麽，没良心的傢伙。</p>
<p>—你娘的，嫁人去，烏家，我徧不管你便怎麽着。</p>
<p>每次都是紅着眼睛的回答。每個男子也都是這樣回答他的女人的。亂使性子有時把女人拖過來打一頓。用這事洩氣。於是女人就放聲大哭了。往早的日子女人説的話男人是没一句不聽的，要哪樣便哪樣，可是現在不同了。男人聼見女人一開口就冒火。每天便那麽的儘吵架，你怨他，他怨你。家不成家了。女人也不把男子看成自己的丈夫，男人也不把女人看成自己的妻子。什麽都像孽債似的。</p>
<p>連女人的性情亦變成男子一樣的兇很了，一天到晚老不儘嘴的咒　　的，罵男人，打兒子。沉着臉，什麽不想，應該做的也不去做。如同失去了感覺。呆呆的坐在門口上，成天儘着天岀神，像要從那裏找岀了什麽東西來，而天老是不變，永遠一大片藍青邊，澄淸的，没一塊雲朶。怎麽會得有雨來呢，天真是瞎了眼睛啊！又那麽罵了，另後重重的太息着。許多人都同樣太息着，望着不變的天。</p>
<p>吃什麽去呢？一些日子後村里無論如何站不了了。得另外想法去，於是男人一個個離了家，離了村中向别地方去了，接着女人要去了。村里便頓然的形岀異樣的凄凉寂寞來，可是天依滿是不變的。</p>
<h3>「哇！媽！夜報要　？」</h3>
<h3>故都雜寫</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>行</p>
<p>提起故都，就會使人想起「無風三尺土，有雨滿地泥」這一句形容故都的辭句來。前些時，我也還懷疑這話或是岀自詩人所誇口，好像「白髮三千丈」那樣的荒唐，及至足履其地，才明白這倒是句實話。</p>
<p>故都，雖也是個住有百多萬人家的大城市，而且又是數百年來的帝王之鄉，但説起道路來，就未免要使人嘔氣了。柏油路，除幾處熱閙的街市外，不等説是没有了，就像個樣的石子道，也是很少看見的。鬆散的泥土道，大約是經不起驢車，馬車，黄包車，……時時刻刻的輾軋吧，許多條路的中間，竟凹陷一兩多尺深。天一落雨，就積蓄着一窪窪汚髒的泥水，行人們，如果捨不得犧牲鞋襪，從汚泥中渡過，就只得停着脚，眼睁睁地看着天空着急了。</p>
<p>這地的土質，説來也是快特别的；不管是多麽濕潤的泥土，經了一二天的好太陽晒過，都漸漸地變為乾燥了。這時，就使一點兒風也没有，車輛來往的走着，天空也常會被灰白的塵霧所蓋滿。人在塵霧中走着，要是眼睛和鼻子，不是生來特别好，就保不得不會發生毛病了。</p>
<p>毛厠到處都有，「注重衛生」的牌子，到處都張掛着，但，十一二歳以下的孩子，好像是誰賜給他們一種特權似的，是可以隨地便溺的；並且驢，馬，狗，……這些畜生，又是特别多，他們拉</p>
<h3>東南西北</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>報載有鄂人王芝生者，專在大光明及南京等電影院中偷竊呢帽，先亦購票入塲，電影及半，舉足鈎前挑座下之帽，揚長而去，此中人名之曰「脚釣魚，」較之在電車乘客頭上硬幹之「抛頂宫，」藝術有天壤之别矣。</p>
<p>我們稍稍注意社會新聞，這類鈎心鬥角的偷竊行為，真是層岀無窮，無論破案迅速，及科以徒刑，而幹没本錢生意之繼起者有增無减。</p>
<p>一方面果然是這些游手好閑之徒不肯習上，另一方面無工可做也是實在的情形，在褲子帶無可再緊的時候，就挺而走險了。幹幹「脚釣魚，」比較起來還是安分守己之輩，殺人越貨的新聞不是每天多着嗎？</p>
<p>這是我們耳目所聞所的事，恐怕暗中更甚於此，王芝生雖已科刑六月，那些後起之秀的「姜太公」或者又有新發明了吧？</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>矢的地方，也多是在人行道上，如果留心看看，在每一條胡同裏，人屎馬糞，是到處都可以發現的。這一些，如在白天，跑路當然不會發生什麽問題，但一到夜晚，就有些不妥了；因為路面是那麽的崎嶇，路燈是那麽的暗淡，——許多胡同連路燈也是没有的——移開一步，尚保不得是否能站得牢，那裏還能顧慮得到這許多呢？所以，夜晚逛街，帶回一脚臭糞，這是很平常的事的。</p>
<p>「行」，在許多人的腦子中時常憧憬着的故都，就有了這麽多的苦難！</p>

<h3>組織開發西北恊會</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>前幾天本欄載有余俊傑君一文，由余君發起組織西北考察團，對於西北先作實地的考察。這個辦法我很贊成，希望他很快的組織起來。現在我有幾個關於組織和進行上的幾個意見，特寫岀來，供各同志的參考。</p>
<p>（一）開發西北，是一件很浩大的工作，假使我們個人或祗集二三位同志，就想岀發到萬里遥遠的西北去做開發的工作，是很危險的；不獨人力經濟，均感困難，而且人地生疎，萬難達到成功的目的。是以吾人必須徵求多數的同志，先來組織一個開發西北的恊會。</p>
<p>（二）這個恊會的目的和組織的方法—一·恊會的宗旨是以推進開發西北的工作，和恊助開發西北的同志為主體，二·徵求合法的發起人，召集一次發起人會議，主持一切事務，三·會員的徵求，基金的籌募等等，均待發起人會議後决定。</p>
<p>（三）開發西北的方法—許多軍隊在岀征之前，必先組有先鋒隊，從事前方的佈置，然後大軍方可順序前進。我們開發西北的步驟，也是這樣的。首先組成健全的團體，然後從多數的同志中，選擇專門人才，另組一個開發西北的通商隊（即先鋒隊），以經商來着手，將東南土産及各都市的物品。推銷到西北去，將西北的物産，輸運到都市來，後方恊會的工作，是籌劃經濟物質等方面，以供給前方。一方面集中人才，等到前方順利，而有相當根基的時候，再將後方的多數同志，源源的送到西北去工作。這樣的進行起來，似乎有點把握點。</p>
<p>上述幾點，不過約略談談，至於詳細的計劃，還有待於多數同志共同的研究，現在不必詳談，深望有志西北事業的同志，通函討論。並乞編者先生代為鼓吹，以觀厥成。周少堂，通訊處：上海九江路一五○號中國聯運社。</p>

<h3>中西建築的比較</h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>近年以來，建築界中常有一種疑問，就是「中國建築和西洋建築的優劣」這個問題的解答，不能够隨便的下斷語，因為牠們關係整個國家的歷史，和整個民族的風俗和習慣，所以一直到現在，雖然費去許多建築師和工程師的研究，現在尚未有相當的解决。</p>
<p>在這個問題没有解决以前，我們可以用工程師的目光，細細的把中西二種建築，從各方面比較一下，然後從這個比較中，也許可以得到相當的解决辦法。</p>
<p>一，中西建築外表的比較</p>
<p>中西建築第一種的不同點，當然是在外表，一個建築物的外表，足以代表每一國家的文化和民族的習慣，我國建築外表第一特點，就是「雄巍」和「雅麗」，外人名謂富於藝術性的「東方色彩」，這是誰也不能否認的，因為有四千年的歷史關係，所以我國的建築，富於古國的氣味，牠們是寛廣的，而傲漫的雄踞着，同時牠們幽嫻地富於曲折，像少女微笑的引誘，但是歐美建築的外表，完全不同，牠們堅强地踞着，足以代表牠們新興的國家，牠們都充滿着「進取」和「勇敢」的氣味，這是牠們第一個特色。</p>
<p>二，中西建築材料的比較</p>
<p>我國建築用的材料，大半採用木，石，磚，瓦，等，木料中以杉木，松木和椐木用得最多，近來雖漸漸採用洋松木，但尚不普遍，吾國一切的建築材料，向來没有標準的尺寸，例如磚瓦等製造各異，木材截面的面積，也没有一定的表格，這都因為機器不發達，一切材料都賴手工的採取和製造。</p>
<p>歐美的建築材料，除掉上述的幾種外，尚有水泥，鋼，鐵，和鋼骨水泥等，因為他們機器的發達，所以一切的材料，都用機器採製，所以木料的長度和截面，都有一定的標準，鋼，鐵，水泥，都有一定的化學成分，他們對於每一種材料的引力，壓力，剪力等，都有詳細的試騐，每種材料經過材料試騐機後，都記錄着很詳細的結果，使工程師選擇容易，近年以來，我國各大都市雖漸漸地採用水泥，鋼鐵等為建築材料，但是尚不能普遍，全國大半的區域，仍然採用固有的建築材料。</p>
<p>三，中西建築設計的比較</p>
<p>中西建築的最重要的分别，是在於設計，我國自來建築的設計，大都憑工人的經騐，力的分析，詳細的製圖，都付缺如，這種全憑經騐的建築，雖然有時很安全，但是憑現代工程的目光看來，這種建築制度，已成為落伍之流，這是無可疑義的，歐美建築的不同點，就在這上面。他們在設計的當兒，對於整個建築的内力和外力的分析很詳細，各種意外的外力。如風，雪，雨，等都加以考慮，然後選擇材料，這種材料都有一定的形狀，例如工形丁形等等，牠們有一定的堅固，足能勝任一切考慮過的力量，絶對不會發生任何危險，這種科學化的設計的結果，足以使他們建築數層到數十層的堅固建築物。</p>
<p>四，中西建築器械的比較</p>
<p>二十世紀是一切機械的世紀，我國建築類皆賴人工，其效率極小，例如人工打樁，最多不過三四尺。歐美各國，利用機器打樁，可深至四五十尺，相去不啻十餘倍，所以數十層的建築可以巍峙。近年來電銲的採用，殆已普遍歐美，鋼鐵建築物的接筍處，從前都用鉸釘緊接，不但損傷鋼鐵的力量，並且有損美觀，現在可以用電氣銲接，在幾分鐘内，能够把巨大的接筍處，溶解為整塊金屬，其力量的增加幾乎要五倍於前，任何的一切，他們都利用機械以得到最高的效率。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，中西建築最緊要的不同點在「設計」，「建築器械」，和「材料」，我國建築的唯一缺點，就是因為這三種的關係，處現在科學化的二十世紀中，我們憑「經騐」和「手工」的建築制度，是不能存在的。</p>
<h3>歐洲奴隸時代之建築發源地（下）</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>（乙）幼發拉的河流域的建築</p>
<p>在講到埃及建築的時候，我們就想到在梯搿里司河及幼發拉的河流域（Tigris　and　Euphrates　Valley）的許多美麗的建築，也是一樣的雄壯與偉大。這裏是歷史上有名强悍的民族白勃龍Babylon人民居住的地方，所以無疑的他們的岀品一定隨處都顯露着堅强的特性。不過他們所建的房屋，和我們所説的埃及式的，就有許多根本不同的地方。</p>
<p>第一，在幼發拉的河及梯搿里司河的兩旁，没有豐富的石礦，所以白勃龍人就設法想岀了用日光烘磚的方法來，供給他們建造房屋的材料。用了磚，在建築上就可以有彎曲的地方，不必像埃及建築的這樣直率簡單了。於是在白勃龍人所建的巍大的廟宇和宫殿上，我們發見有弧拱建築法的地方，這是埃及人所極難做到的。</p>
<p>第二，白勃龍人民住的地方，時常受到外界的侵犯，所以他們的建築才能，因此就移到别的事物上去。在他們居住的城市區域四周，都有極堅固的城墻保䕶着，彷彿我國的一樣，也有敵樓雉堞之類。並且在他們的廟宇上，都有很古怪尖頂的高塔，其意義恐怕也在於瞭望偵察吧。直到現在，我們還脱不了這尖塔的建築，尤其是教堂等地方。</p>
<p>此後，有安西里人Assyrian佔據了這地方，他們帶來了石建築的方法。再後，又有卡兒笛人來了Chaldean，他們對於磚與石的兩種建築，都供獻了許多改良。所以在那時候，白勃龍地方的花園，宫室，以及廟宇等建築，就成了世界聞名的奇觀。</p>
<p>在這許多偉大的建築中，數百年來，在式樣上很少改變。尤其我們所不應忽略的，就是牠們仍都是建造在虐政和奴隸制度的基礎之上的。</p>
<p>（丙）愛琴海邊的建築</p>
<p>在同時代這數世紀中，建築却在愛琴海Agean中的許多小島上勃發起來，特别是著名的克里的Sea島。在這裏我們可以看見有許多的建築法，很新式的，同我們現在的差不多。他們的房屋不再像埃及或白勃龍人民所造的那樣簡單了。在一所房屋之内，也包括許多房間，廳堂，以及走廊之類。家庭的舒適程度是特别的進步，房屋内除了油漆，裝飾之外，更有浴室，泉水，陰溝，種種的設備，很像我們現在的一個摩登的家庭。愛琴海中的許多小島，天然的成了一座溝通東西的石橋，從這裏才産生岀此後數千年來歐洲繁盛的文化來。</p>
<p>這早年驚人的文化，産生在愛琴海中，後人有呌牠Grete，是紀念克里的的一個古代的國王，名米諾Minoan。這米諾的文化與建築，雖距今有五千餘年之隔，却是非常的摩登化。在哪沙Minas地方的一座皇宫，好比是一個小城市，一共有四層樓，裏面有廣大的演講廳，有天然泉水的浴室，還有戲院，至於排泄溝渠與衛生的設備，更屬完備。一切都是遠勝過於埃及或白勃龍人所能做到的。</p>
<p>但是我們亞洲的地方在那時候究竟怎樣呢！我們已經有長足的進步了。建築在中國已很發達，顯然我們的文化，開發實在歐洲之前。在這裏我們不能多講，當另為一文，作我國建築發達史之考。</p>
<h3>戲院建築論（下）</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>（七）休息　好多的影戲院。是没有休息室的。有時我們去得早一些。上一班影戲没有映完。那便很討厭。除了立在買票處之外。没有别法可想。時間長一些。又是氣悶。又是脚酸。怪討厭。近來有幾家戲院。雖然已有休息處的設備。但我們覺得地方總太小。而且又没有凳子坐。所以我們希望以後所新建的戲院。能够都有休息室的設備。而且要多放些凳子。</p>
<p>（八）冷熱　以前在戲院裏面。除了熱天用風扇。冷天用火爐之外。更没有什麽其他冷熱的裝置的。直到最近。有幾家戲院裏面。都裝起冷熱水汀了。然而這種冷熱的裝置。也要温度調劑得宜。倘然過熱和過冷。夏天在戲院裏很凉。走到外面忽然熱起來。冬天在裏面很暖。走到外面去冷得發抖。一冷一熱。均非所宜。已有好多觀衆為了冷熱的不調而害病了。所以也不可不謹慎呢。</p>
<p>（九）便所　在戲院的裏面。盥洗室當然也是必需的設備。但設置的地位。在建築的時候。也須經過相當的考慮。和觀衆所坐的地方太近了要有臭氣。太遠了岀進很不便。因此。地位非得折衷。不遠又不近才好。有幾家戲院。建在地下層。可把臭氣完全隔絶。當然是一個很好的方法。在盥洗室的上面。我們很希望都有電燈或牌子指示。因為有的戲院。會使人找不到便所呢。</p>
<p>（十）防火　為了戲院是公衆的塲所。萬一發生了危險的事件。便會肇成慘禍。所以一所戲院。在建築的時候。所用的材料要堅固。以避免坍塌的危險。尤其是火警。太平門的多設。防火藥品的購置。是必要的事件。除了火險之外。此外危險的事件很多。雖然危險的有無發生。要看管理的如何。但建築的時候。如能先加注意。關心於各種禍患的防止。也未始不可消滅禍患。而增進觀衆的安全呢。</p>
<h3>行人道上種樹之必要</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>在行人道上種植樹木，自古已有此法。周官以「道無樹木，為邦政不修之徵。」甘棠遺愛，政有由來，蓋行為人生四大要素之一，都凡徜徉憇息，皆賴此蔽天遮陰，以適應其行的需要。降至後世，市廛湫溢，閭閣不修，路政漸失，列樹凌亂；即有栽種，亦因灌溉失時，或摧殘頻加，十年之功，終於難成。直至現代，科學進步，世界各國，以植樹為建築市政之要圖，故列强對於植樹，確有一日千里之勢。而我經濟衰落之中國，鍳於大勢所趨，亦能勉力做去，栽培森林，發展種藝，每年舉行植樹大典，同時各省提倡造林，殆深知此項建築，其利益實非等閒：（一）對於自然界，可以防止水旱風雹等天災。（二）對於生産物，可以供給建築製造燃料及畜牧等之用途，（三）對於人生觀，可以改良環境，點綴風景，絶對的有益衛生。</p>
<p>所以在現代，關於行人道上，種植樹木，既屬不容稍緩之舉，各省各市，應一律施行有系統的栽樹，人民應與合作保護，行之既久，自然成績斐然！在都市省會之樹木，大約在十年之後，即可長成，是不特可以調節空氣，蔭及行人，並且可以銷解汚質，抑制塵沙，增加城市之美觀。尤其裨益人民之衛生，其功用最大，蓋樹木之為物，既宜夏復宜冬，有調和氣候之效能，而且樹木之呼吸，適與人類相反，可以吐養吸炭，故居屋之前後，及街道之兩旁，果有成行巨樹，則人類無論居行，莫不感覺精神愉快，以及促使身體健康，於是可以知種樹於行人道上，對於建築市政，猶其餘事，對於人民住行健康問題實大，若再推而廣之，則雖欲養成强健民族，亦必賴植樹，而無所疑義！</p>

Therefore, there was talk that the aircraft might fly directly to Baotou. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Flies to Nanjing</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing by large aircraft at noon on the 5th from Shanghai. He immediately went to his ministry to handle official business. At 3:00 PM, he gave a lecture at Jinling Women's College. After attending the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 6th, he will take a plane north at 2:30 PM to inspect water conservancy and finance. He will first go to Beiping, then to Zhangjiakou to meet Chairman Chiang, and finally to his ancestral home in Shanxi Province to handle affairs at Mingxian School. The inspection is scheduled for ten days, and Councilor Li Qingxuan and others will accompany him. (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Kong Xiangxi telegraphed that he will fly to Taigu at 1:00 PM on the 7th. (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Wang Chonghui said, "I have reported to Chiang on my trip to the southwest. I don't know if Kong Xiangxi will arrive in Beiping today or tomorrow. I may visit the Ming Tombs today. I originally intended to take this opportunity to visit the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, but I am not sure if I will be able to go. There has been no correspondence with the Southwest recently. After I return south in a few days, I will stay in Shanghai and do not plan to travel to the Southwest again." (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Lu Muting, Director of the Hebei Department of Finance, and Li Zaizhong, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Finance Bureau, are scheduled to go to Beiping on the morning of the 6th to meet with Finance Minister Kong to request instructions on the reorganization of finances in Hebei Province and Tianjin. The second step in Hebei's plan to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes is being drafted. After the abolition, the police and education funds in various counties will be shaken, and there are no ways to offset the budget shortfalls. The province's plan to change the dental tax to a business tax has resulted in losses of more than ten times the revenue and is therefore not feasible. The city's financial income has recently decreased compared to the past, and a military subsidy is planned to request a complete exemption or reduction from the Ministry of Finance. Lu and Li are meeting with Kong for this matter. (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>

<h3>Zunhua-Yutian Militia Defend Yanshan Pass</h3>
<p>Blocking Bandits from Outside the Pass</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the evening of the 3rd, more than 200 bandits were discovered in Xiezhuangzi, Yutian County, advancing towards the county seat. The county's militia has rushed to intercept them and has dispatched 300 militia members from Zunhua to provide support. More than 500 militia members from Zunhua and Yutian counties are still at Yanshan Pass, blocking bandits from outside the pass. That group of bandits has gathered outside the pass, reaching 600 people. Every one or two days, they send out small teams to disturb the militia defense lines inside the pass and probe the strength of the team's defenses, so the militia cannot be withdrawn to the county. Each militiaman receives 60 cents for meal expenses per day, which are apportioned among the people of the two counties. More than 30,000 yuan has already been apportioned. Although the farmers suffer from the apportionment, there is nothing they can do. (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>

<h3>President Wang Reports on Three Important Tasks of Last Week</h3>
<p>At the National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 5th. Wang Zhaoming, Chu Minyi, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Yipeng, Wei Huai, and other officials from various ministries and commissions, totaling more than 600 people, attended. President Wang presided over the ceremony and reported on two important tasks of the previous week: (1) matters concerning disaster relief between the central government and various provinces; (2) the reasons and purpose for convening the National Examination and Appointment Conference. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] President Wang reported on the National Government's Memorial Week on the morning of the 5th. His original words are as follows: (1) Regarding the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, following the previous week's report, there is something to report. Last week's report explained the recapture of Shicheng, Xingguo, and Ningdu, and the old nest of Ruijin was on the verge of attack. In this week, there was news of the recapture of Changting. Undoubtedly, the bandits in Ruijin have been hit in the waist. The recapture of Ruijin, Yudu, and Huichang is not far off. The original plan for bandit suppression was to encircle the bandit nest. When breaking the bandit nest, the bandits inside the nest were to be completely annihilated. Under these circumstances, the bandits either resist to the end or try to escape. Recent news is that some bandits plan to escape through the defense area of the Southern Route Army. It is hoped that the Southern Route Army will follow the original plan, strike head-on, and prevent them from escaping. The goal of recapturing the bandit nest and annihilating the bandits will then be achieved simultaneously. (2) In the previous two weeks, the central government decided on urgent disaster relief matters. Last week, Minister Kong was designated as the chairman and other members were to proceed as soon as possible. It was also stipulated that all civil servants with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or more would donate one yuan, those with 100 yuan would donate two yuan, and those with more than 100 yuan would donate 2% of their salaries. Originally, the central government wanted civil servants to maintain integrity and ensure a moderate standard of living. These two points are complementary. Therefore, the central government has regulations that do not allow civil servants to solicit donations casually. Even expenses for weddings, funerals, childbirth, birthdays, etc., should be limited to avoid waste. This is to protect them from various unreasonable compulsions of social customs. The central government's hard work in maintaining the integrity of civil servants' lives can be seen from this. However, disaster relief is different from other matters. This year, the disasters in various provinces are severe, as everyone knows. In addition to the government's efforts to provide relief, we also hope that social groups will assist in the relief efforts. Therefore, as civil servants, we must lead by example and advocate for social groups. We are already unable to sleep peacefully and eat well due to the disasters in various provinces and the displacement of disaster victims. Therefore, we must be happy to support the central government's proposal to donate salaries for disaster relief. (3) The National Examination and Appointment Conference was held on November 1st and closed today. There will be detailed reports on various proposals in the future, which need not be repeated. However, we must pay attention to the fact that examination and appointment belong to the independent authority of the Examination Yuan. This time, Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, presided over the National Examination and Appointment Conference. Central government agencies such as the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Control Yuan were invited. Provincial agencies such as the directors of civil affairs and education departments were also invited. This is because examination and appointment are naturally under the jurisdiction of the Examination Yuan, but they are closely related to other agencies. In particular, the central government and the provinces must be linked as a whole. Therefore, in order to gather wisdom and benefit, this conference was held. At this conference, there were detailed resolutions on the problems that should be supplemented and revised in various examinations and appointments. We hope that after this conference, the examination and appointment system will be more complete and achieve the important goals of "selecting the virtuous and capable" and "making the best use of talents."

<h3>Li Jingzhai's Report at the Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Government held its 155th Memorial Week on the morning of the 5th. Zhongwei Ju Zheng, Li Jingzhai, Gu Zhenggang, Li Ciwen, and all staff members, totaling 500 people, attended. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, and Li Jingzhai reported on the issue of land consolidation and provincial district division, stating that the provincial and county areas of our country follow the old system of the Qing Dynasty, with complex and chaotic boundaries, unequal areas, and many obstacles to security, administration, and the promotion of autonomy. It is imperative to re-survey and delineate them. I believe that this matter must be carried out simultaneously with land consolidation. Not only will results be easily achieved, but also expenses will be saved. The provincial and county boundary lines of the United States are all straight lines, becoming square, which is better than the triangular and network division methods. We should also follow the example of the United States when dividing provincial districts. After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.

<h3>After Implementation of Silver Export Tax, Outflow of Silver Has Gradually Decreased</h3>
<p>A Banker Details the Pros and Cons of Chinese and Foreign Banks</p>
<p>Proper Savings Should Be for the National Economy</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since the implementation of the silver export tax, silver exports have gradually decreased. The policy of collecting silver export tax has been effective in preventing the outflow of silver. However, according to reports, many foreign banks are still shipping silver abroad from Shanghai. I recently met with a banker, who said that since the government levied a silver export tax, there is no profit to be made from buying and selling silver. Except for supplementing the import surplus and filling the international exchange rate, there should be no further silver exports. However, some foreign banks are still shipping silver because speculative wealthy merchants and corrupt officials and politicians, who have lost their credibility, believe in foreign power and entrust their ill-gotten wealth to foreign banks, buying US dollars, British pounds, and other foreign currencies, flowing silver into the vaults of foreign banks and exchanging it for foreign banknotes, believing that this will bring peace of mind and that personal property can be passed down forever. Little do they know that foreign banks are unreliable and foreign currencies are unreliable. In the past twenty years, the examples are countless. Taking banks as an example, such as the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, the Russo-Asiatic Bank, the Banque Industrielle de Chine, the Sino-American Maoye Bank, the Sino-Japanese Exchange Bank, and the Banque Franco-Chinoise pour le Commerce et l'Industrie, etc., the amount of losses suffered by Chinese depositors due to the bankruptcy of these banks is shocking. Taking currencies as an example, such as the Russian ruble, the German mark, the French paper franc, and the Japanese old banknotes, the number of losses suffered by Chinese people who collected these banknotes due to devaluation or suspension is incalculable. All of these are the lessons that foreign banks and currencies have taught the Chinese people. However, they are still obsessed and believe that foreign banks and foreign currencies are reliable. It is lamentable. Recently, most countries have adopted currency control and inflation policies, concentrating cash and storing it as a reserve. The currencies circulating in the market are all banknotes and fractional coins made of base metals. Once an emergency occurs, a paper order can be issued to suspend cash withdrawals. In this case, what methods will the foreign banknotes in our hands have to avoid devaluation or worthless losses? The harm of draft banknotes is a lesson not far away. Recently, the government has strictly regulated the banking industry and closely supervised it. Most domestic banks are also down-to-earth, seeking the development of legitimate business to fulfill their financial circulation duties. The government is actively promoting legitimate savings for the people. For example, the recently formulated Savings Bank Law has very strict supervision of banks. Everything is done to protect the interests of savers. At the same time, banks are also seeking various conveniences for savers. Compared with foreign banks, which rely on unequal treaties as a shield and cannot be supervised in peacetime, and cannot be sanctioned after bankruptcy, the difference is like heaven and earth. However, the general public with huge sums of money do not think about the national economy and do not bother to weigh the gains and losses of Chinese and foreign banks. They blindly believe in foreign banks and currencies. What is taken from our people is sent abroad, resulting in the outflow of silver, which has a great impact on the national economy. They are truly pests of the nation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Construction Department Reports Siphon Silt Land Reclamation Situation</h3>
<p>[Jinan] When Chiang passed through Shandong, he ordered the Construction Department to report the details of the province's siphon silt land reclamation. The department has now reported that the completed Puta, Licheng, Qihe, and the junction of Qingcheng and Qidong have 67,000 mu of silt land that cost only 30,000 yuan. The province's sandy and alkaline land along the Yellow River that can be reclaimed by siphon irrigation amounts to 170,000 hectares in 15 counties. The equipment cost is 4.47 million yuan, which can be completely silted into fertile land. Also, the Ai Mountain Dam in Dong'e County diverts Yellow River water for irrigation and siltation, which can irrigate 7,300 hectares of good farmland and reduce the Yellow River's water volume by one-tenth. The project cost is 1 million yuan. The Economic Commission has allocated 600,000 yuan, and the rest will be borne by the province. The second step of surveying and design is now underway.

<h3>The Closing of the Examination and Personnel Conference</h3>
<p>Expanded Memorial Week Held at the Examination Yuan</p>
<p>Dai Jitao Delivers Closing Remarks</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Examination and Personnel Conference held an expanded memorial week at the Examination Yuan's auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 5th.  Approximately 300 people attended, including all representatives to the conference and all staff members from the Examination Yuan, the Examination Commission, and the Ministry of Personnel.  The event was chaired by Central Representative Ye Chucang. After the performance of rituals, Dai Chuanxian gave a report, stating in brief, that it was of great significance to hold a memorial service for the Premier at the Examination Yuan together with representatives from central and local organizations. The Premier's memorial to Li Hongzhang in his youth still resonates with readers decades later, deeply moved by the Premier's consistent sorrow for saving the country and loving the people. Establishing a blueprint for the Republic of China, there are three sentences in the Premier's memorial: "If education is proper, there will be no wasted lives; if encouragement is appropriate, there will be no suppressed talent; if appointments follow principles, there will be no opportunists." These are not only significantly related to the duties of the Examination Yuan, but also the root of future national administration. The cause of China's decline lies in the opposite of these three sentences. However, personnel and administration cannot be achieved solely by the Examination Yuan. Therefore, these three sentences were taken as working principles, and this conference was convened to discuss everything. Personnel and administration are like a bolt of cloth, and these three pieces of instruction are like a ruler. The Examination Yuan can only carefully use this ruler to measure the scholars of the world, he said. At 9:00 AM, the fifth general assembly was held in Mingzhi Building. Approximately 100 people attended, including both attending and observing representatives. The assembly was chaired by Dai Chuanxian.  After the performance of rituals, Wang Yongbin, the Secretary-General of the assembly, read the minutes of the previous meeting. Then, the draft declaration was passed, with the original drafting committee responsible for refining the wording. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM, and the closing ceremony commenced. Chairman Dai Chuanxian played music and conducted the ceremony. Dai Chuanxian delivered the following closing remarks: Since the opening of this conference, we have followed the Premier's instructions, received guidance from the central government, leadership from various officials, and cooperation from political, educational organizations, and groups nationwide, in order to fulfill its mission and build a new foundation for examination and personnel administration. All resolutions passed are extremely important issues. In the future, these resolutions will be reported to the central government, formulated into laws and regulations, and earnestly implemented. This will not only provide a basis for the work of this Yuan but also provide great assistance to all political and educational endeavors. As we close the conference, the colleagues of this Yuan respectfully and sincerely accept all resolutions, diligently and cautiously strive to implement them, and especially hope that all political and educational organizations and groups at the central and local levels will make their best efforts to promote success and progress. He wished the conference complete success and the development of the cause and thanked everyone for their efforts and wished everyone health. Following this, Central Representative Ye Chucang gave a speech, stating in brief that employing people according to law and retiring people according to law are the foundation of personnel and administration. The discussions at the conference in recent days have all been related to such issues. In the future, a good foundation can be laid for personnel and administration. He wished the conference success and the implementation of the resolutions. Next, National Representative Deng Jiayan gave a speech, stating in brief that the conference had been extremely successful. He (1) appreciated the efforts and discussions of the representatives; (2) hoped that all resolutions could be diligently implemented. Subsequently, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, Deputy Minister of Interior Gan Naiguang, and Director of Political Affairs of the Executive Yuan Peng Xuepei delivered speeches successively. Finally, Director of Education of Gansu Shui Zi delivered a reply on behalf of the speakers. Thus, the grand National Examination and Personnel Conference concluded amidst melodious music. The conference had originally planned to host all representatives for a tour of Qixia Mountain on the 5th at noon, but due to rain, the venue was temporarily changed to a banquet at Jiming Temple. In the evening at 6:00 PM, the representatives attended a banquet given by Chairman Chiang and He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, and He Yaozu at the Lixing Society, where the atmosphere was extremely pleasant. In addition, the New Asia Society's Northwest Development Association and the Northwest Problems Research Association also scheduled a banquet for the Northwest Border representatives attending the conference at 4:00 PM on the 6th.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>North China's Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Water conservancy is the biggest issue concerning agriculture. The guidance of the Huai River, longed for by tens of millions of people in Jiangsu, has been preliminarily realized through the vigorous promotion of the provincial government.  This is undoubtedly the first great feat of our government in regulating water administration.  Recently, it was heard that the North China Water Conservancy Commission has also agreed to excavate the Yang River canal in Wanquan County, Hebei Province, to benefit agricultural irrigation in its affiliated areas. This can also be said to be the motivation for developing water conservancy in North China. The guidance of the Huai River in the south is in its initial stages, and the excavation of the Yang River canal in the north is only a resolution. Moreover, looking at the national local undertakings, it seems to have a very small relationship with the entire national economy. The benefit is also partial. However, we know that water conservancy and irrigation have, in fact, aroused the deep attention of the entire nation. Moreover, this issue is crucial in the south, but it is even more urgent in the northern regions. Although areas south of the Yangtze River also experience drought, they are less affected by insufficient rainfall because of the greater amount of rain and more abundant rivers. Even if they occasionally feel it, artificial remedies are easier. As for the northern provinces, especially Chahar, there are even fewer rivers. If agricultural development is to be implemented, it must start with water conservancy first.</p>
<p>Currently, there are too few places in North China that truly enjoy water conservancy. The most famous of these are the vicinity of the Mongolian Loop of the Yellow River and the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi. Secondly, places such as Baiquan in Huixian, Shuiye in Zhangde, Yuquan in Pingxi, and Jinci in Taiyuan are also able to carry out irrigation and grow rice. However, the benefits are not widespread. On the whole, it cannot be considered water conservancy. As for most places, not only are there no ditches in the countryside for water conservancy, but even the so-called cities and provincial capitals lack waterways for draining sewage. In the summer and autumn seasons, when there is a little more rain, floods run rampant everywhere. In winter, the riverbeds dry up, becoming natural roads. The Fen River is like this, and the upper reaches of the Hutuo River are also like this. If this situation is not artificially transformed and fought against nature, how can there be hope for the recovery of farmers' livelihoods?</p>
<p>The area most in need of water conservancy in the north is the area from Zhongmu to Shangqiu in Henan Province. Because of insufficient rainfall and no way to irrigate, the soil is gradually becoming barren. Many plants cannot be planted successfully. If this continues, in a few hundred years, it may turn into a stone field. Therefore, there are two morbid facts before us. One is the continuous occurrence of floods, and the other is the gradual transformation into stone fields. Tracing back to the source, it is the result of neglecting water conservancy.</p>
<p>Dredging ditches is an important part of water conservancy projects. Engaging in large-scale rural revitalization movements is especially indispensable. However, its effectiveness is often partial and limited. Originally, there must be natural rivers or their tributaries in the local area to take advantage of the situation to dig canals and ditches, and actually benefit from irrigation. There are few rivers in the north, so it is naturally difficult to generalize. The only thing that is less restricted by nature is well-digging. Almost everywhere can dig a well to get a spring. However, the farmers in North China, who are currently extremely poor, do not have the surplus funds to dig wells. Therefore, when it comes to digging wells, not only do the public water conservancy agencies need to be consultants for exploring water sources and guiding well-digging work, but also public funds must be used to dig larger public wells for farmers to use. If not, low-interest loans must be used specifically for farmers to dig wells. In places with cooperatives, you can entrust the cooperatives to do it. In that case, the benefits of water conservancy projects can be relatively widespread among the people of North China.</p>
<p>As for the original rivers in North China, we also need to find ways to dredge them. Otherwise, those rivers that are gradually becoming clogged will inevitably have the danger of causing floods. Now, there are many difficulties in dredging the Yellow River. However, it is still within the financial capacity of the local government to dredge the small rivers first, such as the Qi River, Wei River, Hutuo River, and Zhulong River. When necessary, it may also be possible to obtain special subsidies from the central government. However, operating this kind of major water conservancy project requires not only funds but also planning and talent. It is not as easy as digging a well.</p>
<h3>A Shocking Case of Trafficking Chinese People</h3>
<p>Smuggled into the US from the West Indies</p>
<p>Only 18 Out of 38 People Were Rescued</p>
<p>Four People Were Thrown into the Sea Due to Illness En Route</p>
<p>Keansburg, New Jersey Today, a tragic case of human trafficking occurred here. Four out of thirty-eight people died tragically, and the rest were detained. Government secret agents obtained a lead, learning that traffickers were hiding Chinese people in a farmhouse near this small town. They raided the place this afternoon and found eighteen Chinese people. Two of them had studied at a Chinese university and spoke fluent English. They recounted the various sufferings they endured when they were secretly trafficked into the United States from the West Indies. It is said that there were a total of thirty-eight Chinese people being trafficked. They gathered in the area of ​​Trinidad, where the traffickers had contacted accomplices in the United States. They then hired a cargo ship. These thirty-eight unfortunate Chinese people were secretly hidden in the cabin. After sailing into the sea for several hours, four of them could not withstand the wind and waves, and cramped in the bottom of the cabin, the air was extremely turbid. They succumbed to seasickness. When the ship approached the coast of the United States, preparing to land and smuggle them into the country, these four were already seriously ill. The traffickers heartlessly threw all four into the sea. The remaining thirty-four people were carefully packed into taro bags and transported ashore in New Jersey. They were then transported to this farmhouse in cargo trucks. Sixteen people had already been sold. Those who are currently detained are waiting to be sold, and so on. The eighteen detained Chinese people have now been sent to Ellis Island to be deported to China. Government officials are searching for the sixteen who were sold. (4th, National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The First Fierce US Election Competition Since the North-South American War</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's New Deal Faces a Litmus Test</p>
<p>Both the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Optimistic</p>
<p>The California Gubernatorial Race is Perilous</p>
<p>[Washington] Tuesday is the date of the US midterm elections, with forty-seven states holding votes simultaneously. Whether President Roosevelt's "New Deal" has the faith of the people will be tested by this election. In the past, every government has suffered losses in congressional seats during the midterm elections in the second year of its term. In recent governments, the average loss of congressional seats has been forty-seven. Therefore, if the Democratic Party's losses in this election do not exceed thirty-five seats, it can be considered that the people have expressed confidence in the President's policies. However, Democratic Party leaders hope that the election results may lead to an increase in the party's seats, while the Republican Party claims that it can increase its seats in the House of Representatives by as many as sixty. Postmaster General Farley, chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee, stated today that the Democratic Party can seize at least four seats from the Republican Party in the Senate. However, the outcome is still unpredictable, as the states of New York and Massachusetts have the most seats and may lean towards the Conservative Party. As for the gubernatorial elections in each state, the competition between California's socialist writer Upton Sinclair and the current Governor Merriam is the most noteworthy. It is said that government leaders have expressed opposition to Sinclair's "End Poverty in California" plan as it is difficult to implement. In total, thirty-one senators, three hundred and thirty-two representatives, and thirty-three governors must be re-elected on Tuesday. Twenty-four of the current governors are affiliated with the Democratic Party. (4th, National Dispatch)</p>
<p>[New York] New measures will be subjected to the most severe test in the electoral arena in a few hours. Politicians across the country now acknowledge this year's general election as the most important since the North-South American War and expect the Democratic Party to hold a majority in Congress. However, extremism has now passed its peak. It seems certain that former socialist writer and reformer Upton Sinclair, as a Democratic candidate, will lose the California gubernatorial seat. The betting odds on Sinclair's reelection are only one to five against incumbent Governor Merriam. The Republican Party is unlikely to win a considerable victory in both the Senate and the House of Representatives this time because Republicans are unwilling to directly challenge President Roosevelt's New Deal, as he is very popular. It is generally believed that government relief funds will be a major factor in people supporting the New Deal. It is heard that several Democratic leaders have warned impoverished voters that they should support Democratic candidates if they want to continue receiving relief benefits. The Republican Party claims that it has no hope of winning Congress in the face of this "unprecedentedly large campaign expense in American history." New York Governor Lehman is currently a candidate for reelection, and it is generally believed that he will win by a landslide. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>San Francisco There are currently three candidates for California Governor: incumbent Governor Merriam, Upton Sinclair, and Welfare Progressive Party candidate Haight. Haight said somewhere today that no matter who is elected between Merriam and Sinclair, it will cause a serious bloody battle. Sinclair replied that if he is elected, there will be no bloodshed. But for Merriam, he agrees with Haight, because Merriam has no plans or political views for dealing with the economic crisis. Sinclair said today that he has received news that 208 experienced New York gangsters have been recruited to California to conspire to switch ballot boxes. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Melbourne The rankings of the England-Australia obstacle flight race have been announced today as follows: Champion English aviators Scott and Black, runner-up Dutch aviators Parmentier and Moll, third place Australian young aviator Melrose.

<h3>European Political Instability Leads to Shake-Up of Gold Bloc</h3>
<p>Observations by US Financial Authorities</p>
<p>[New York] Financial authorities here generally believe that developments in the European political situation will cause some gold bloc countries to abandon the gold standard. According to general opinion in Wall Street, the current situation in Europe is extremely dangerous. It is only a matter of time before France and other gold standard countries abandon the gold standard, and this will cause the world to become unstable again, and international monetary warfare is feared to be inevitable. However, most experts say that the theory of international monetary warfare is too pessimistic. If countries abandon the gold standard, the result may be to promote international monetary coordination. (4th, National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Kerosene Policy Promotes Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>Open Door Policy Benefits Only Japan</p>
<p>Naval Equality Difficult to Grant Japan's Request</p>
<p>[Washington] Naval authorities here expressed satisfaction today that British views on Japan's request for naval equality have gradually aligned with those of the United States. It is believed here that Japan's plan to establish a kerosene monopoly in "Manchukuo" is the greatest force in shifting British opinion. US naval leaders stated today that Japan's kerosene monopoly plan is indicative of the outcome that should be expected if the United Kingdom and the United States were to yield to Japan's naval equality request. Furthermore, after Japan's naval equality, other commodities besides kerosene will also be annexed to Manchuria, and the so-called "Open Door" will only be enjoyed by Japan.

<h3>Naval Talks Enter Second Week, Stalemate Difficult to Break</h3>
<p>Three-Nation Representatives Sit and Wait Quietly</p>
<p>Britain and Japan Hold Secret Consultations</p>
<p>[London] The naval talks' stalemate has now entered its second week, but it is still proceeding in silence. The representatives of the UK, US, and Japan are all sitting and waiting quietly. The US representatives are sitting in the West End hotel waiting for the Japanese representatives to act. The Japanese representatives are waiting for Britain to make a suggestion. They expect British Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira to hold secret talks today and hope that the British Foreign Secretary can find a way to break the stalemate. At the same time, the British representatives are also eagerly awaiting Japan to propose a new proposal other than the unwelcome equality proposal. The US side now believes that the current stagnant situation can only be changed by Japan putting forward a "less resistant" plan. The US side now expects that Japan will soon indicate that it is willing to discuss limited equality, that is, an agreement to achieve equality in a few years. This kind of suggestion should at least allow the talks to reopen. However, the US general election is scheduled to be held tomorrow, so the US representatives are deeply pleased that no surprising developments have occurred in the naval talks, as such developments may overturn the Democratic Party's chances of winning.</p>
<p>If the outcome of the naval talks is unsuccessful, the US Pacific coast states will be even more panicked and may show their reaction by opposing President Roosevelt's party.</p>
<p>In private talks with Britain and the United States, Japan explained that Japan intends to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty at the end of this year. Japan is currently not urgently announcing the abolition of the treaty and is likely to issue it within two weeks. (5th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Colonel House's Optimistic Tone Seems Premature</h3>
<p>Japan's Request Remains Unwavering</p>
<p>Reaching a Compromise Ultimately Difficult</p>
<p>[New York] Colonel House, a confidant of the late President Wilson, assisted the late President in many plans during the Versailles Peace Conference. He recently expressed his opinion on the London naval negotiations, saying that he has great confidence in the outcome of the negotiations and expects that an agreement on limiting naval armaments will definitely be reached. According to reports, Colonel House had this optimistic tone after a long talk with President Roosevelt. (4th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Colonel House, the late President Wilson's close friend and most trusted advisor, said in New York today that a naval compromise is possible. The US delegation regards this statement as unfounded, saying that the possibility of a naval compromise today has not improved compared to when the Japanese delegation first put forward its plan. Japan is still demanding equality, while Britain and the United States are demanding maintaining the ratio system. According to the current situation, it is very difficult to reach a compromise.

<h3>Kerosene Dispute: Japan Replies to Anglo-American Protest</h3>
<p>Cunning Wording Shifts Responsibility</p>
<p>Does Not Acknowledge Violation of Equal Opportunity</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the oil control issue in "Manchukuo," the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States protested to the Japanese government on August 21 and 31. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a reply to the case at 6:00 PM on the 5th and handed it over to the ambassadors to the United Kingdom and the United States for separate delivery to the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. A summary of its main points is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The control of oil in "Manchukuo" originally belonged to the policy of the "Manchukuo" government, which the Japanese government cannot interfere with and is in an inconvenient position to explain. However, based on information from various sources, the Japanese side has learned that the "Manchukuo" Petroleum Company was established based on the special regulations promulgated on February 21 of this year. Upon investigation, the regulations did not grant the company any exclusive rights. The regulations of the company and the company's fund also do not stipulate restrictions on any nationality. Furthermore, the "Manchukuo" government gives as much consideration as possible to the interests of foreign residents and merchants residing in the country. Therefore, it feels that those involved in relations between the two countries should negotiate directly. Judging from this situation, since it has not predetermined differential treatment for Japanese and other foreigners based on their nationality, the so-called open door policy has not been found to have any violation of the facts.

<h3>Japanese Mandated Island Report</h3>
<p>Discussion Raised by League of Nations Committee</p>
<p>Japan Sends Mr. Ito to Attend</p>
<p>Refusal to Allow Solar Eclipse Observation Group to Enter Causes Criticism</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Mandate Committee opened a meeting this morning to discuss the Japanese government's report on the mandated islands in the Pacific. According to reports, the islands are located north of the equator and originally belonged to Germany. After the European War, Japan was entrusted with their mandate in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. Japanese Ambassador to Switzerland Ito represented the Japanese government at the discussion today. Participants repeatedly asked Ito whether the report that Japan does not allow foreigners to visit the islands was true. The American astronomical expedition's plan to go to observe the solar eclipse a year ago was rejected by the Japanese authorities, which was cited by the audience as the main evidence. Ito replied that he was unaware of these twists and turns. The Japanese authorities may have taken this precaution out of caution. He will investigate the events mentioned. He believes that the Japanese government itself has also organized a solar eclipse observation group and invited governments such as Soviet Russia to send scientists to participate in this work. The committee adjourned until this afternoon. (5th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Expansionism Rises Amidst Continued Disarmament Efforts</h3>
<p>Main Committee Issues Notice of Convening</p>
<p>But Date Still Not Determined</p>
<p>[Geneva] With militarism rearing its head in several parts of Europe, and the possibility of naval competition becoming a subject of widespread discussion, there has suddenly been an announcement that the Disarmament Conference is about to resume its work. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, after conferring with British Foreign Secretary Simon and American representative Davis in London a few days ago, has now convened the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference to meet here for deliberation.

<p>[Geneva] The main committee of the League of Nations today issued a notice convening a special session on November 20 to deal with the serious situation in the Saar region and discuss other important issues. When Chairman Henderson of the main committee issued the notice, he did not specify the particular issues to be discussed, but it is believed that the crisis in the Saar region is the main reason for convening the special session, as France declared last week that it had concentrated troops in the Nancy area in preparation for dealing with a German occupation of the Saar.

<h3>Gold Mine Case Resolved Amicably Between Britain and Russia</h3>
<p>Russia Agrees to Pay £3 Million to Cancel Concession Rights</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Lena Goldfields dispute was resolved last night. The Government Concessions Committee has signed an agreement completely resolving all the points of contention that have adversely affected Anglo-Soviet relations for the past five years. The Soviet Russian government formally announced this morning that the agreement had been officially signed. The Lena Goldfields dispute has lasted for five years. The Soviet Russian government has now agreed to pay the British side £3 million as the price for resolving the outstanding issues. The London Arbitration Tribunal initially ruled that the Soviet Russian government should pay the British £10 million to compensate for the British equipment used in the Lena Goldfields. At that time, Moscow was only willing to offer £1 million. The Lena board of directors then reduced the amount to £3.5 million. The final settlement was finally fixed at £3 million. The Lena Goldfields Company of Siberia was established in 1925 and obtained the right to mine gold for 30 years and the right to mine other minerals in the southern Altai region of the Urals for 50 years. It is said that the company failed to raise enough capital to develop the mine. These mining rights were cancelled by Soviet Russia in 1929. Most of the creditors are British, and the company is also run by British financiers and entrepreneurs. (5th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The agreement regarding the Lena Goldfields case was signed today at the bedside of Mr. Marshall, the general manager of the Lena Goldfields Company, as Mr. Marshall is currently suffering from influenza and unable to go out. The representative of the Russian government who signed the agreement was Derifanov. The agreed compensation of £3 million will be paid by the Moscow Narodny Bank. After the agreement is approved, a down payment of £50,000 will be paid first, and the remaining amount will be paid in installments every six months for 20 years. The notes for the installment payments can be transferred, but no interest will be added. The settlement of this gold mine case is due to the Russian government's desire to use it to improve friendship between Britain and Russia. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Egyptian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>Cairo It was heard today that the Egyptian cabinet resigned yesterday. King Fuad of Egypt has not yet appointed a new prime minister. The most vocal candidates to succeed him are former cabinet leader Nessim, former envoy to Britain Afifi, and former Minister of Justice Maher. On the 26th of last month, Egyptian Prime Minister Yehia accused British Acting Agent in Egypt, Peterson, of attempting to interfere in Egyptian internal affairs, which strained relations between Britain and Egypt. Because King Fuad of Egypt had been ill for a long time, and the Egyptian constitution did not have a provision for appointing a regent when the king was incapacitated, the prime minister consulted with Peterson on the steps to be taken. After Peterson telegraphed the British government, he advised the prime minister to appoint a cabinet leader as a liaison between the Egyptian cabinet, the Egyptian king, and the agent. However, this suggestion was not welcomed by the prime minister, hence the accusation that Peterson was interfering in Egyptian internal affairs. But two days later, the Egyptian king issued an edict appointing Muhammad Ziva as cabinet leader. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Discusses Budget Proposal</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Fujii Explains the Deliberation Process</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The first day of the budget cabinet meeting, convened specifically to deliberate on the fiscal year 10 budget proposal and the newly established temporary income tax, opened at 2:20 PM on the 5th. First, Finance Minister Fujii explained the deliberation process and results of the fiscal year 10 ordinary account budget proposal. Next, Naval Minister Osumi and Army Minister Hayashi spoke. Subsequently, all cabinet members stated that they could understand Finance Minister Fujii's painstaking efforts in the current extraordinary fiscal situation. However, the original proposal as deliberated by the Ministry of Finance was only received today and there was no time to examine its contents. They could not express opinions on the deliberation proposal and would wait for inspection before further discussion. Their meaning seemed to indicate some dissatisfaction and contained an implication of requesting additional funding. Finance Minister Fujii replied that for the sake of maintaining fiscal credibility, it was necessary to gradually reduce deficit bonds. He hoped for understanding of his position and requested that matters be handled properly before the major exercises. The cabinet meeting on the 5th only heard Finance Minister Fujii's report. Further discussions will be held tomorrow. Those who raised questions today included Agriculture and Forestry Minister Yamazaki, who asked the Finance Minister whether the temporary income tax would continue to be implemented permanently. The Finance Minister replied that it was entirely temporary in nature. Finally, Prime Minister Okada stated regarding the convening date and duration of the temporary Diet session that he hoped it could be decided at the cabinet meeting on the 6th.

<h3>Austro-Hungarian Maintenance of Friendly Relations</h3>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Visits Austrian Authorities</p>
<p>Political and Economic Matters Both Involved</p>
<p>Vienna Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös's visit here seems to be largely of a reciprocal nature. Gömbös arrived here at 12:15 PM today and immediately went to the war memorial to lay a wreath. After that, he successively visited Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg. A banquet was then hosted by the Prime Minister and his wife. After lunch, the Prime Minister accompanied him to the church to visit the tombs of former Prime Minister Seipel and Dollfuss. From there, he returned to the Hungarian embassy. Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg then visited the embassy to reciprocate. Gömbös then paid a visit to President Miklas and Prince Starhemberg. He departed for Rome at 8 PM. Although Gömbös's meeting with Austrian authorities was brief, the government still issued a statement saying that Austro-Hungarian relations were close and friendly. The Hungarian Prime Minister discussed general political conditions with Austrian authorities, as well as economic issues related to the two countries. Opinions were also exchanged on Hungary's proposed cultural cooperation plan. (Note: When Gömbös recently visited Warsaw, he established a cultural cooperation agreement with Poland, and later intended to expand the scope of this agreement.) (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Balkan Small Country Solidarity Strengthens</h3>

<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Issues Remarks Before Leaving Turkey and Returning Home</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey The Balkan Entente Political Conference recently held its meeting in the Turkish capital.

No matter what incidents occur, the Balkan Entente has a way to deal with them without hesitation. Our work is certainly to seek the interests of our own countries, but we have never neglected the interests of our neighboring countries. For example, although Bulgaria has not signed the Balkan Pact (Note: The signatories to the Balkan Pact are Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece), we still treat it with a friendly attitude."

<h3>German Education Minister Reinstated, Tens of Thousands of Farmers Celebrate</h3>
<p>Police Stand Guard, Ignoring the Crowd</p>
<p>Lüneburg Today, tens of thousands of farmers from various parts of Bavaria gathered in the city square here to celebrate the reinstatement of the head of the South German Church. Although Governor Streicher stated that any form of demonstration was not allowed, the farmers enthusiastically cheered when Bishop Meiser of Bavaria arrived on the scene. Although the police had deployed a cordon around Meiser's car, the crowd ignored it, vying to greet Meiser. At the same time, church officials declared that Streicher's claim that Bishop Meiser had joined the German Church led by Archbishop Müller and was subject to the Archbishop's restrictions was completely fabricated. Bishop Meiser was previously suspended by Archbishop Müller for opposing the German National Church. Later, a delegation of parishioners visited German leader Hitler, presented the whole matter, and was reinstated through Hitler's efforts. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Taiwan Bombing Incident</h3>
<p>A Youth Throws a Bomb at a Police Station</p>
<p>Hunted for Months, He Commits Suicide</p>
<p>[Xiamen] Taiwan news, on September 29th in Keelung a bomb was thrown at the police station and exploded, injuring two people and destroying a wall. This was an unprecedentedly serious event in Taiwan. It happened to be the day after Prince Nashimoto visited Taiwan on his return journey, and two days before Prince Nashimoto visited Taiwan. The Governor-General recognized it as a major event and banned its publication. The bomber was a Taiwanese youth, Zheng Qinghuo, 21 years old. He escaped at the scene. That night, he was surrounded and arrested at a Lin's house. Zheng seized the opportunity to escape, severely injuring police officers Lin and Chen Shui with a knife, and escaped again. The entire Japanese police force in Taiwan was mobilized to arrest him. After months of failing to capture him, two police officers were punished. The ban was lifted on October 26th, allowing reporting. Subsequently, Zheng appeared in the Xiajiaoxi Village, Malin Tribe of Keelung on October 28th, plotting to raise travel expenses. When the police detectives received the report, they rushed to arrest him in large numbers. Zheng was surrounded in a rice field. Knowing that he could not escape, without waiting for the detectives to approach, he stabbed himself in the abdomen with the Taiwanese knife he was carrying. His intestines came out and he bled profusely, but he sat upright and calm. The police beat him from behind with a wooden stick without moving him. Then they arrested him. They only knew that he had committed suicide when they sent him to Yilan Hospital. He died due to excessive bleeding. He did not make any confession. The villagers considered him a Taiwanese revolutionary youth. Bombing the police station was unprecedented in the Japanese rule of Taiwan, and it happened during the visit of two princes. Not being able to arrest him for months especially exposed the Japanese police's incompetence. (5th Special dispatch)</p>

<p>Xiamen Communication: The military campaign against the Communist bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi has two focal points: one is Shicheng, and the other is Changting. After the fall of Guangchang, the Red bandits once discussed abandoning their old nests in Fujian and Jiangxi and fleeing outward, but ultimately decided to hold onto their old nests to the last ditch. Their plan was (1) to place heavy troops north of Shicheng to defend against the National Army, and (2) to place relatively heavy troops to defend Changting to the death. Those defending Shicheng were the pseudo-13th and 5th Army Groups, and those defending Changting were the pseudo-9th Army Group and the 24th Division of the 1st Army Group, while also taking care of Shicheng. Changting is 80 li from the old nest of Ruijin, close to the bandit core, and extremely important. On September 26th, both route armies simultaneously issued a general attack order. As for the Eastern Route Army's advance on Changting, preparations began after Liancheng was captured on June 1st. Changting's east borders Liancheng, and is a north-south mountain range. It is extremely dangerous above Jiuxian to Tongcheng. However, there is a road that can pass through the mountains from Pengkou West to Wenfang Zhongwucun, and Baiyi Yangling controls its mouth. It is truly Changting's only important gateway. If Baiyi Yangling is not defended, it is equivalent to Changting's gateway being wide open, with no defense to hold. Therefore, the bandits built extremely strong fortifications at Baiyi Yangling. The Eastern Route Army's attack on Changting thus had Baiyi Yangling as its only target. Once Baiyi Yangling falls, it is in fact the recovery of Changting. After that, it can be driven straight in. After four months of preparation, the full-line attack began at dawn on September 26th. Wenfang was occupied that day. At noon on the 27th, Baiyi Yangling was captured in one fell swoop, and the remaining positions nearby were cleared. On the 29th, the bandit's front-line headquarters was captured, and temporary fortifications were rushed to be built. On October 4th, the second line of the bandit's defense, Nanshan Dam, was attacked. The bandits retreated slightly, and on the 6th, the National Army arrived at Hetian. The bandits had already abandoned Hetian and retreated first, and it was immediately recovered. At the same time, the bandit forces in Changting also abandoned the city and retreated west back to Ruijin, leaving a few remaining bandits to guard the city. Because Changting, with the loss of Baiyi Yangling, had no defense to hold, the bandits only resisted slightly at Nanshan Dam, and then abandoned Hetian and Tingcheng and went west. Moreover, the bandits defending Baiyi Yangling were originally the entire pseudo-9th Army Group, the entire pseudo-24th Division, and a part of the pseudo-1st Army Group. However, as the Northern Route Army launched a general attack at the same time, the bandits had no choice but to transfer the entire pseudo-1st Army Group to Shicheng, leaving only the pseudo-9th Army Group and the pseudo-24th Division to fight. However, the most elite of the bandit's main force was the pseudo-1st Army Group, followed by the 3rd, 5th, and 9th Army Groups. On the day the Eastern Route Army arrived at Hetian, Shicheng was also captured by the National Army. Although the terrain of Hetian is not dangerous, it is extremely important. It borders the upper reaches of the Ting River. Downstream, it passes through Huilong, Shanghang, Fengshi, Dabu, and Sanhe, reaching Shantou in Guangdong Province, which is the sea outlet for the bandit area. The bandits' supplies were previously transported by the Ting River, reaching Changting and then transferred to the bandit area. After the National Army captured Hetian, it immediately blocked the river, and transportation was completely cut off. The bandit area's supplies were also completely cut off. This alone is enough to determine the bandits' fate. And as the army entered Hetian, it could have driven straight into Changting. However, since the fifth bandit suppression campaign, the plan has been to take gradual progress, gradually rush to build roads and bunkers, and rush to build the Pengkou-Wenfang-Zhongwucun-Nanshanba-Hetian road (Pengkou to Zhongwucun is 40 li, and Zhongwucun to Hetian is 60 li). By the end of October, the road was completed. Jiang Dingwen arrived in Longyan from Zhangzhou on the 29th, and Li Yanping, commander of the Fourth Column, flew to the Hetian front on the same day. Once Jiang arrived in Longyan, he ordered the capture of Tingcheng. On the 30th, the army in Hetian advanced towards Tingcheng from Caifang. At 11:00 AM on the 1st of this month, the leading troops of the 9th Division were the first to enter the city. The scattered small bandits in the city had already fled west, and over ten remaining bandits and a large number of propaganda items were captured. Subsequently, Li Yannian also personally led his troops into the city. Lin Sixian, the administrative inspector of the Seventh District, also entered the city with the army to handle the aftermath. The bandits only left a part to defend Xinle, a mountain range on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, to cover Ruijin. However, after Shicheng was captured by the National Army, the bandits knew that they could not hold it for long. Xingguo and Ningdu were subsequently recovered by the National Army, making it even more difficult to stand. They thought of breaking through and fleeing west, and most of them had already reached Dayu and Shangyou in southwestern Jiangxi. There are not many bandits left in the old nests of Ruijin, Yudu, and Huichang. The armies pressing in from the northeast will soon recover the bandit nests. Changting was originally the seat of Tingzhou Prefecture and is an important town in western Fujian. It borders the Ting River and connects to Shantou. In 1927, when the Communist bandits launched an uprising in Nanchang, He Long and Ye Ting led their troops to Guangdong, passing through Tingzhou, which was the beginning of the bandit's capture of Tingcheng. In the winter of that year, Guo Fengming of the Second Mixed Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army was transferred from Quanzhou to Changting. Guo was a native of Changting and was quite effective in defending Ting. In the spring of 1929, Zhu De and Mao Zedong captured Ting, and Guo was killed in battle. The four regiments of his troops retreated to eastern Ting. The four regimental commanders could not cooperate and killed each other, and the brigade advanced and retreated, giving the bandits an opportunity to take advantage of it. By the summer of 1931, Brigade Commander Lu Xinming (Guo's third regimental commander, succeeding Guo) could not resist the pressure of the bandits and retreated to Liancheng. From then on, Changting was long occupied by the bandit area. Because it is close to Ruijin and controls the upper reaches of the Ting River, it is the transportation hub of the bandit area. Therefore, the bandits valued it, no less than a pseudo-capital (November 3rd).</p>
<h3>Southern Route Army Pursues and Attacks the Ganzhou Bandits on Three Routes</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, Dated the 25th, 26th, and 27th of last month. The Communist bandits desperately charged in the area of Wujing, Xinfeng. The Southern Route Army staunchly defended the front lines, eventually defeating the Communist bandits. Unable to achieve their goals, the bandits turned to retreat northwards via the rear route, crossing the Gan River from Wangmu Ferry and Wangfu Ferry, and attempting to camp at the border of Nankang. On the 29th, a part of them passed Qinglong, where they were intercepted and suppressed by the Southern Route Army's Wu Jianhong division. After a day of fierce fighting, until 7 PM, the bandits began to flee northwest from Qinglong. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were killed, over a hundred were captured, and over a hundred rifles were seized. It is reported that about 30,000 Communist bandits intend to escape along the old route of Xiao Ke. In addition to consolidating the defense lines of San'nan, Junmen, and Yuling, the Southern Route Army has decided to divide its forces to pursue and attack. The border between Guangdong and Jiangxi has been newly fortified and is now free of remaining bandits. Between Yudu and Huichang, there are still some bandits who have not retreated. The troops stationed on the Junmen front line are currently protecting refugees and organizing harvesting teams to cross the Zhang River and harvest the grain in the bandit-controlled areas of Huichang.

<p>Patrol Officer Killing Incites Public Outrage</p>
<p>The case of Zhu Deming, a patrol officer in the 8th District of South Pudong Public Security, causing a death while arresting gamblers, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that this case has aroused public outrage. In addition to the district chief Li Zongtai sending a telegram to the county government and public security bureau to severely punish the offender, more than ten citizens, including Yang Huai Ruo, have jointly requested an investigation to legally punish the patrol officer and the quack doctor involved. Zhu and Ren were transferred from the county bureau to the court's procuratorate for interrogation on the afternoon of the 5th. As a result, both the patrol officer and the doctor were released on bail pending further questioning and verification after summoning District Chief Li and other witnesses.</p>
<p>Jinshan</p>
<p>District Chiefs Resign En Masse</p>
<p>Since taking office, the magistrate of Jinshan County, Tu Kaiyu, has been out of step with public sentiment and has been repeatedly accused. Recently, he was ordered to handle the Baojia system and arbitrarily reduced the district administrative expenses when compiling the budget, and did not follow regulations to comprehensively allocate defense funds to the fullest extent. Local people are deeply dissatisfied. The district chiefs, finding it difficult to handle affairs and unable to maintain their positions, submitted their collective resignation on the 4th. It is said that their intention to resign is very firm.</p>
<p>Agricultural Extension Institute Achieves Good Results in Rice and Cotton Cultivation</p>
<p>Since Bao Jiezhi, a local resident, took over the county's agricultural extension institute, he has worked hard to manage it, and the results have been quite good. Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, the institute, in order to increase agricultural production and promote seedlings, invited people from all walks of life yesterday to hold a performance evaluation meeting for rice and cotton cultivation. According to the evaluation results, the best rice crop was Yishi Xin 314, with the number of grains per panicle ranging from 156 to 246. The best cotton crop was improved white-seeded cotton, with each cotton plant having 20 to 46 bolls, which is unprecedented in agricultural fields. Compared with ordinary farmland, the yield has increased by more than double. It is also reported that the institute will distribute the seeds to farmers in appropriate quantities for promotion.</p>

<p>Two Robbery Cases Occur on Water and Land</p>
<p>As winter approaches, bandits are rampant on both water and land routes. Although the authorities have strictly cracked down on them, the bandits still appear and disappear unpredictably, and remain unafraid of the law. At about 1 AM yesterday morning, a ship from Suzhou to Changzhou, fully loaded with goods, was passing through the Wu Dijing area in Gaoqiao, which is under the county's jurisdiction. Suddenly, it was encountered by more than ten bandits, each holding weapons such as pistols and iron rulers, forcing the ship to stop. They then jumped onto the ship, overturning cabins and emptying boxes, searching and robbing at will. After more than ten minutes, the bandits escaped with their loot. After inspecting the losses, the goods and cash carried by various merchants from Suzhou and Changzhou were all robbed, totaling more than 500 yuan. The shipowner, Wu Hefu, has reported the information to the Shipping Association, which has forwarded it to the county government, requesting the arrest of the robbers and the recovery of the stolen goods. Also, Xu Xianggen, a villager from Xujia Village, Cao Wang Township, in the county's Third District, has been making a modest living by operating a pig boat. Unfortunately, he attracted the covetousness of bandits. At about 10 PM the night before last, more than ten bandits suddenly robbed him of all his silver dollars, gold jewelry, and clothing, causing a loss of more than 200 yuan. It is said that he has not yet reported the incident to the county government to request an arrest.</p>
<p>Wuxi-Jiangyin Highway to be Repaved with Gravel</p>
<p>When the Wuxi-Jiangyin Highway was built, it had a cinder surface for vehicle traffic, and it has been several years since. However, the entire road is not very complete, especially the northern section (i.e., the Jiangyin section of the road surface), which is even more rugged. Whenever there is heavy rain, water accumulates into ditches, which is inconvenient for both vehicles and pedestrians. The Wuxi-Jiangyin Long-Distance Bus Company, in view of this, has planned to pave the road with a gravel surface after several considerations. It has now been approved by the provincial government. The paving cost, totaling 36,000 yuan, will be paid by the company in advance. The project will start construction soon. At the same time, the company has obtained the exclusive right to operate on the road for 20 years.</p>
<p>Resolutely Oppose Increasing the Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The government's recent plan to increase the unified tax on cotton yarn has aroused opposition from the cotton textile industry across the country. After holding meetings and passing resolutions, they issued declarations and insisted on fighting to the end. However, the Cotton Textile Industry Association of this county recently heard that the industry in Shanghai, under an unofficial name, had requested the government to change to a four-level tax system. This violates the resolutions and public opinion of the general meeting. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened yesterday afternoon, and it was decided to immediately send telegrams to the Shanghai Tax Bureau, the Customs Bureau, and the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation, stating that if any individuals use the name of the industry to make separate contacts regarding the increase in the unified tax, any claims that are not decided upon by a public meeting are invalid.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Soybean Industry Asks for Withdrawal of the Anhui Province Miscellaneous Grain Relief Donation</p>
<p>Lin Yibao, Chairman of the Wuyi Soybean and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, telegraphed yesterday (4th) to President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Headquarters, Minister Chen of the Nanjing Ministry of Industry, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways, Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior, and the Rural Reconstruction Committee, stating that reports indicate that the Anhui Provincial Government, in order to raise funds to relieve the famine, has issued a notice to collect donations on miscellaneous grains. Regardless of whether they are transported out of the province by cart or boat, a donation of five dimes is levied per dan, which is equivalent to restoring the likin tax at a rate of 5%. Reading this caused great consternation. China's commercial market is becoming increasingly desolate, and the rural areas have become bankrupt. The entire country is in a state of panic, and there is no way to hide it. Taking this year's disaster areas as an example, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are rich areas, but they have been hit the hardest by the disaster. If Anhui Province can freely establish an agency to collect donations, why can't Jiangsu and Zhejiang establish one? Other provinces that have suffered from floods, droughts, and partial disasters are everywhere. Why can't they also establish relief donation offices? If Anhui Province initiates this, other provinces will follow suit, and the likin tax that has harmed merchants and people for decades will be completely restored. However, how will our government explain the order issued in 1933 that rice, wheat, soybeans, and grains should circulate freely throughout the country and should not be subject to any donations? Is this not in conflict with the clear order issued at home and abroad in 1930 that the central government would resolutely abolish likin and increase taxes? Since Anhui Province is subordinate to the central government, it should take into account the authority of the central government and consider the public sentiment of the entire country. This illegal collection agency should be revoked immediately. This would be fortunate for the whole country, not just for one industry. I respectfully request that you quickly order the Anhui Provincial Government to comply and find other remedial measures. I cannot express enough my eagerness to await your orders.</p>

<p>Poor Autumn Harvest in the Huainan Reclamation Area</p>
<p>The reclaimed areas in the counties of Huainan, Tongtai, and others have suffered from severe drought this summer, and early autumn has brought repeated wind and rain, causing great damage to cotton seedlings. The autumn harvest has now been completed, and the companies have reported the disaster situation. The cotton harvested is less than 30% of previous years. The total revenue is only around 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Xiulun Silk Factory Stops Production</p>
<p>The Xiulun Silk Factory outside the South Gate of Jiaxing has been run by Shi Heling this year. There are a total of 400-500 female workers inside the factory, engaged in silk reeling and other tasks. The silk produced by the factory is sold to other locations and has gained quite a reputation. Now, the factory has temporarily stopped production since the day before yesterday because the silkworm cocoons it had in stock have all been reeled. Most of the female workers have also returned to their villages. The factory will resume production once a large portion of raw materials has been transported in.</p>

<h3>Article 9 of the Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegrams to the Whole Country</p>
<p>Striving for Passage According to the Original Proposal</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce convened its 37th Standing Committee meeting on October 29th, and nominated Standing Committee member Li Kuian to go to Beijing to attend the Legislative Yuan's review of the Commercial Registration Law, as previously reported. After receiving a report from Standing Committee member Li on the circumstances of his attendance, the association immediately notified chambers of commerce in all provinces and cities throughout the country, requesting that they unanimously strive for passage of Article 9 of the Commercial Registration Law in accordance with the original draft to the Legislative Yuan. The two articles are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Kuian's Letter on the Attendance Process: Respectfully, I, Kuian, was nominated to attend the review of the Commercial Registration Law as a representative. I went to Beijing on the 30th, and at 9 AM on the 31st, I went to the joint meeting of the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan with Chen and Luo, the representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The meeting began at 9:30 AM, chaired by Committee Member Ma Yinchu. At the meeting, Kuian presented each of the four opinions discussed by our association in detail and copied them onto another paper and handed it to Chairman Ma for selection. However, regarding the second article, that the manager should be jointly and severally liable regardless of whether or not he is registered, Chairman Ma Yinchu quite agreed with his statement. Other committee members disagreed, saying that the manager's responsibility was too great, and it would be difficult to find a suitable manager. If they were afraid of the manager cheating, the shareholders would have the responsibility to supervise at any time. As a result, it would be given considerable restrictions. The remaining articles will be decided in the implementing rules. As for the second article of the draft, the registration procedure is to be carried out by the parties concerned to the competent authority in the place of business. The representatives said that registration directly by the parties concerned would be quite obstructive to the system of commercial organizations. Please add that the parties concerned should report to the trade association, which should be transferred to the chamber of commerce, and the chamber of commerce should issue a certificate. The government should then register on this basis. Article 9 is the most important condition of the original draft. Some committee members still disagreed. The representatives insisted that this article could not be changed. Articles 17 and 28 are not very clear. After much discussion, please add details to avoid abuses. The remaining results of the discussion of the standing committee's proposal are that the drafter will reorganize the opinions presented and notify them by letter that day, convene a meeting, and re-examine them. The circumstances of the attendance are hereby sent to you for your reference.</p>
<p>Telegram to the whole country to strive for consistency: The chambers of commerce in all provinces of the country and the chambers of commerce in all cities have jointly investigated and found that this association previously received letters and telegrams from various chambers of commerce, because Article 681 of the Civil Code on Obligations stipulates that partners are jointly and severally liable for debts, and the rights and obligations are not balanced. The request to forward the amendment to the meeting was sent by this association to the Legislative Yuan, requesting amendments. The reply was that the article need not be amended, and a Commercial Registration Law would be enacted in the future to remedy the situation. This association again sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, requesting that this association be allowed to nominate representatives to attend the revision of the Commercial Registration Law. On October 27th of this year, a letter was received from the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan requesting the nomination of representatives to attend the joint meeting of the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan on October 31st of this year to present their opinions. The 17th Standing Committee meeting was convened by this association and Standing Committee member Li Kuian was elected as the representative of this association to go to Beijing to attend the joint meeting of the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan and present his views. The representative has already returned to Shanghai after completing his mission and prepared a report to the association. The ninth article of the law, the name and address of the partners, and the type and amount of capital contribution, if they have been registered by the individuals themselves with the competent government authority in the place of business, may bear the responsibility for sharing losses within the limits of their capital contribution, and the same applies when shares are transferred or changed. This is the most important thing. It has not yet been decided. It is appropriate to copy the report and send it to your association for your information. I hope that you will unanimously strive for passage of the original draft to the Legislative Yuan to remedy the situation. To the next meeting, this association will again nominate representatives to attend and report separately.

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Various Industries to Raise Funds for Dredging the Songjiang River</h3>
<p>Deadline for Reporting the Estimated Donation Amount</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the industry associations yesterday, saying, "On the 2nd of this month, this association convened two meetings to raise funds for dredging the Songjiang River as ordered by the municipal government. The representatives of various industries attending the meeting all agreed that dredging the Wusong River is indeed an essential plan, but at this time of commercial depression, raising large sums of money is not easy. The municipal government should be requested to not only allocate 50,000 yuan, but also allocate as much as possible. For example, the annual ship donation income is a huge amount, and the municipal finance bureau should have the numbers to check. It is most appropriate to allocate it for dredging the Songjiang River. Also, the dredging fee collected by the Jianghai Customs has accumulated quite a lot, and the municipal government can negotiate with the customs authorities to allocate some of it for application. As for the industries concerned, they should also be exempted from difficulties and considerately help raise funds. The records are on file. In addition to responding to the municipal government, we are sending special letters to the relevant industry associations, assuming that fundraising measures, each industry according to the situation, applicable what kind of measures, after discussion and decision, before November 20, estimate the amount of donations, and reply to the meeting, so as to coordinate the measures, I hope you will investigate and comply."</p>
<h3>Worrying Future of Food</h3>
<p>米米Rice from Various Places Comes to Shanghai, Supply Falls Short of Demand</p>
<p>Late Rice Harvest is Poor, Price Will Continue to Rise</p>
<p>This year, due to the impact of the drought in various places, the autumn harvest has been reduced, and rice prices have soared. After the authorities and various sectors have tried their best to save the situation, rice prices have gradually fallen back, and people's hearts have been slightly stabilized. However, in recent days, rice prices have risen again. According to reliable sources in the rice industry, since the early rice harvest, sources from various places have been enthusiastic, but in the first half of the month, not only have sources become scarce, but the number of people coming to Shanghai from various places to handle food has increased. Even rice-producing areas, such as Wuxi and other counties, also come to Shanghai to purchase large quantities of rice from time to time. On average, tens of thousands of shi of rice are transported from Shanghai to the interior every day, so that the Shanghai market has a situation where supply falls short of demand. Furthermore, according to general observations, whether the current rice price can return to stability depends entirely on how the late rice harvest is. If the late rice harvest is not very good either, rice prices will continue to rise. Therefore, those who are concerned about the people's food are worried about the future of food.</p>

Last year, he suffered from a hernia due to overwork, which started during his efforts to relieve the famine in Shaanxi and gradually worsened during his relief efforts for floods and affairs in the Northeast. He went to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for surgery, and everyone was concerned. Now, fortunately, his illness has improved slightly, and he has come to Shanghai temporarily. Following his doctor's advice, he still needs to continue his recuperation and cannot stay for long. Therefore, we are holding this welcome today to express our sincere regards and comfort him during his departure. Mr. Wang Xiaolai also stated that General Zhu has three "no's": (1) No love for money, (2) No fear of death, (3) True gold is not afraid of fire. Mr. Zhu thanked everyone for their kindness and said that his visit to Shanghai this time was because he was still recovering from his illness and would have to return to Zhejiang tomorrow to sweep tombs. He was unable to visit everyone individually, and was both grateful and apologetic. He also said that in the past, following behind all of you gentlemen, the Northeast refugee relief matters that were handled, when closed last year, he sent the income and expenditure report books to everyone for review. Today, taking advantage of this opportunity for discussion, he also brought the documents that had been submitted to the government for review, for everyone's reference. Mr. Cha Mianzhong explained the contents of the documents, followed by Xu Jingren, Chu Huiseng, He Dekui, Ren Jinpin, Zhang Xiaolin, Qu Shaoyi, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Binhe who spoke successively, all expressing their deep respect and comfort to General Zhu. Mr. Zhang Xiaolin also said that he usually does not give speeches or praise others, but today he feels that General Zhu is worthy of our praise, and with a clear conscience, he cannot help but say a few words. Finally, everyone stood up and wished General Zhu good health before dispersing.</p>

<h3>Pan Hongsheng's Coffin Was Sealed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life Paid Their Respects</p>
<p>Requesting Donations from All Sectors to Comfort the Survivors</p>
<p>Typesetting Workers Donated Fifty Yuan for Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Aiding the Funeral of Patriotic Martyr Pan Hongsheng held the sealing of Pan's coffin yesterday at 1:00 PM. Special representatives were sent to pay their respects and presented clothing as a token of mourning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sealing of the Coffin Yesterday: The Committee for Aiding the Funeral of Patriotic Martyr Pan Hongsheng held the sealing of Pan's coffin yesterday. The ceremony was very solemn, with family members performing the kneeling sacrifice and representatives from various organizations offering sacrifices. The rituals included the safe closure of the coffin. The Shanghai Citizens' United Association's district branches, road merchant associations, embroidery industry, antique industry, trade associations, the China Manufacturers' Federation, Renci Primary School, Shanghai School, and others presented clothing as a token of mourning. More than twenty representatives, including Chen Binghui, Chen Jiufeng, Liu Zhongying, Zhang Xianfang, Zhang Yichen, Zheng Dongshan, Fang Peicheng, Ma Junshuo, and Wang Hesong, were sent to pay their respects and participate in the funeral. Pan Hongsheng had a white-haired elderly mother, a blind elderly father, and siblings who were all deeply grieved. Those who heard of this could not help but shed tears.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations: Since the committee's funeral office announced the request for donations from all sectors, donors have included the China National Products Company (100 yuan), Ningbo Industrial Bank (100 yuan), Zhang Zilian (50 yuan), Ye Jiaxing (100 yuan), Chaozhou Shanghai Association (10 yuan), Qu Zhenhua (50 yuan), Huademao Shunji (20 yuan), and Wing On Silver Company (5 yuan). Yesterday, Yang Xiyuan, a typesetting worker, donated 54.8 yuan, which he had saved over two years by economizing on food and clothing, to help Pan Hongsheng's family with funeral expenses. The above funds were deposited with the Ningbo Industrial Bank at the Shanxi Road intersection and transferred to the funeral office within the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Citizen's Daily News will also publish a special edition on the day of the funeral as a token of mourning.</p>
<p>Letter to the Press: The Patriotic Martyr Association sent a letter to various newspapers yesterday, stating: Since the September 18th Incident, people from all walks of life, motivated by righteous indignation, have risen up to carry out patriotic movements. In our city, there were iron-blooded youths who planned negative work and organized anti-traitor groups to warn traitors, hoping to promote awakening. Therefore, they inevitably acted rashly and violated the law. However, the judicial authorities did not understand the patriotic martyrs' painstaking efforts and did not relax in the slightest, resulting in Liu Chongwu, Cao Songshou, and others being severely punished. Martyr Pan Hongsheng suffered excessive injuries and unfortunately passed away. However, many martyrs are still in prison. Considering that the press is the mouthpiece of the people and the vanguard of the people, we request that from today onwards, you publish articles on the aftermath of the patriotic martyrs and the support and care of the surviving families, hoping to awaken people in society, which will be a blessing to the national revival. We respectfully submit this to you and hope that it will be approved.</p>
<p>Soliciting Support for the Survivors: The association sent letters to major commercial firms yesterday, requesting donations to comfort the survivors: Since the Japanese bandits invaded and occupied our territory on September 18th, public sentiment has been angry, especially after patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng disregarded everything and participated in the January 28th Shanghai Battle. Unable to achieve his goals, he lamented the visibility of national demise and hated the treachery of merchants, so he gathered comrades to form a blood-soul anti-traitor group to carry out patriotic work, resulting in him being subjected to legal sanctions, trapped and ill in prison, suffering serious injuries, and finally dying of illness on November 3rd. However, Martyr Pan has a disabled elderly father and a senile elderly mother. His family's situation is truly tragic. Therefore, we colleagues have initiated the funeral to express our patriotic enthusiasm and request donations from all sectors. We believe that your esteemed firm's business is thriving and its reputation is well-known. We have long admired your esteemed firm's enthusiasm for social welfare, so we are sending a special letter earnestly requesting a donation to meet the needs. This matter concerns patriotic youth and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country, and we are sure that it will be supported by all sectors.</p>
<p>Scheduled Funeral: The association sent letters to various organizations yesterday, stating that the funeral of patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng will be held on the 11th, and representatives will be sent to carry the coffin ropes: Patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng was injured by the police during the patriotic movement, leading to his illness and death on the morning of the 3rd of this month. At the time of his death, he still did not forget the call to save the country and resist foreign insults. Alas, the martyr sacrificed his life for the country, and all who have hearts mourn him. We are now preparing to erect a monument for his funeral and commemorate him, as well as support his family. Funds are greatly needed, and we hope that all sectors will donate and praise his immortal spirit. Please provide elegiac scrolls and sacrificial texts to comfort his soul. The funeral is scheduled for 1:00 PM on the 11th of this month, and we hope that you will send representatives to carry the coffin ropes.</p>
<h3>Mei Wushi Refuses Settlement in the Xin Renhe Steamer Tragedy</h3>
<p>Specially Entrusting Lawyers Tang Hao and Others</p>
<p>To File a Statement with the Court Objecting</p>
<p>The Xin Renhe Steamer of the Nanshi Yuxing Company, previously involved in a drug trafficking incident, suspected that five hawkers, including Ma Koubao, were informants. As a result, Manager Gu Shaoqing, after secretly discussing with Tang Jingseng and others, on April 12th of last year, tied Ma Koubao, Mei Laoer, Zhou Datong, Wei Jincheng, and Shen Xinliang together with lead wires and boulders, covered them with burlap sacks, and sunk them to the bottom of the sea. The matter was reported by their families, and shipowner Sun Xingsheng, comprador Chen Baosheng, and others were sentenced separately and ordered to pay 10,000 yuan in private compensation to the five deceased families.</p>
<p>Forced to Sign: Now, more than a year and a half has passed. Gu Shaoqing and others have not only failed to return the defendants' bail money and compensate the private lawsuit, but have also demanded additional loss fees ranging from 50 to 300 yuan per person as agency fees for the deceased, or fees for reinstatement or promotion for those who have not been arrested. As a result, the families of the deceased have petitioned the Shanghai Local Court to continue to detain Li Shouyi and others. Tang Jingseng and others, fearing that the matter would escalate, entrusted Gu Shaoqing's younger sister, Qian Maozhao (currently the company's accountant), and brother-in-law Xu Taiyuan (currently the steamer's chief officer, i.e., those who previously conspired in the murders), to secretly invite the families of the deceased to the company to intimidate and lure them with benefits, and opened Room 435 of the Central Hotel to force them to sign. As a result, some of the victims fell for their tricks. However, half of the deceased's families, including Mei Wushi, ignored them and entrusted lawyers Tang Hao and others to file a statement with the court, declaring their opposition.</p>
<p>Filing a Statement of Opposition: The original statement is recorded below: Regarding the case of the arrest and request for interrogation of the murderers, it is stated that the petitioner's son, Mei Laoer, and others were falsely accused of theft by shipowner Sun Xingsheng and others of the Xin Renhe Steamer, and were premeditatedly murdered by being tied with lead wires and boulders, covered with burlap sacks, and sunk to the bottom of the sea to eliminate evidence, which was extremely cruel. Fortunately, justice prevails, and some of the murderers have been sentenced by your court. However, those who conspired at the time are still at large, and there are more than forty people, including Wang Guanxian, Zhu Shunlin, and Li Shouyi, who have not yet been arrested. Therefore, the trial should be suspended until they are apprehended. Recently, my nephew Mei E told me that he saw in the newspaper that your court had arrested the runaway murderer Li Shouyi and others on the Xin Renhe Steamer, and that they would be interrogated. The petitioner is old and frail, grieving for the violent death of her son, and her daughter-in-law has remarried. She is blind and lonely. Upon hearing this news of divine justice, she could not help but feel extremely saddened and wept. Therefore, she is submitting this petition to your court, requesting that you punish them according to the law to comfort the souls of the dead. It has been found that the murderers are allowed to return to their positions by the steamer company, which means that their key figures had no choice but to admit to pre-event conspiracy, and it can now be confirmed that they are conspirators. Furthermore, it has been reported that there are more than just Li Shouyi and others who have been reinstated, but there are other individuals serving in important positions on the steamer. The steamer company appears to possess great powers, which is why they were not arrested with the rest of them. It is our hope that your court will conduct an investigation and hold them accountable, so that the masterminds do not go unpunished. Living or dead, we will be grateful. Furthermore, the steamer company, due to the arrest of Li Shouyi and others, is deeply concerned that the situation will escalate. It is said that Gu Shaoqing, Tang Jingseng, Mao Maozhao, Xu Taiyuan, and others have opened Room 435 of the Central Hotel to entice the remarried daughter-in-law, Mei You, and other victims with money to prevent the situation from escalating and involving the remaining murderers who have escaped. In addition to this statement, we hereby declare that the petitioners have not participated in any private settlement. We request that your court pay attention to prevent the remaining murderers from escaping justice.</p>
<h3>Peng Horen and Four Others Specialize in Kidnapping Elementary School Students for Ransom</h3>
<p>Disguising Themselves as Rickshaw Pullers to Aid in the Abduction</p>
<p>Chen Qiyun Cried Loudly, and the Gang Police Pursued and Apprehended Them</p>
<p>Recently, a type of petty kidnapping case has been discovered in this city. Initially, general kidnappers targeted the propertied class in the city, who are qualified to be ransomed. But these have been preparing automobiles and hiring bodyguards to protect them. Kidnapping them has become expensive and difficult to achieve. Recently, kidnappers have had a sudden new idea to gather accomplices near the gates of elementary schools to kidnap elementary school students without weapons. The kidnappers then send a letter to the family demanding ransom money of several hundred yuan. After receiving the ransom money, they release the kidnapped student. The parents are afraid to report to the police to investigate. It happened yesterday around 12PM that Dongming elementary school 3rd grade student Chen Qiyun (age 10), who lived inside the New Kai River and near the Guanyin Temple street, was heading home when he suddenly ran into 5 kidnappers. The kidnappers had been hiding at that place. One kidnapper had even disguised himself as a rickshaw puller and rented a rickshaw which was parked near the road. When the kidnappers saw Chen, one ran up and grabbed Chen. Afterwards, he jumped into the rickshaw and sped away. Seeing that he was being grabbed by a stranger, Chen cried loudly, which was heard by the 21st guard Fu Kangnian, who was keeping watch. Fu Kangnian pursued the rickshaw to the gate of the Small World Entertainment Center. There, guard Liu Guangzhi stopped the rickshaw. Liu apprehended the kidnapper inside the rickshaw, the kidnapper disguising himself as the rickshaw puller, and the small hostage Chen Qiyun. All were brought to the district Yimiao police station. When Station Chief Liu questioned the criminals, one of the kidnappers reported his name was Peng Horen, age 21, from Tongzhou, currently residing at no. 9, Rixinli, Hujunying. Peng Horen stated that he and his accomplices Amao (nickname Old Gun), Yin Agen, Yin Miaochuan (disguised as the rickshaw puller), Genbao, and the other 5 of them had gathered to kidnap Chen today. Yin Miaochuan reported that he was age 19, from the same Tongzhou village as Peng, and that the rickshaw was rented from the Kunji rickshaw shop near the Xichao Temple. Yin also reported that he had participated in similar petty kidnappings near the Xujiahui area. The police were immediately dispatched to search and found the kidnapped student's father named Chen Mengxiong, currently age 53, from Fujian, acting as a manager at the Hengkang miscellaneous grain shop near no. 6 Run Deli in the Fuyou Road Baoren lane. The family had been saving money, which is why the kidnappers targeted them. Chen was immediately summoned to the police station to reclaim his child. The 2 captured kidnappers, the rickshaw, and the case were transferred to the city police bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Huai River Conservancy's 160,000 Laborers Face Difficulties in Food Procurement</h3>
<p>Daily Need is 2,000 Shi of Jiangbei Rice, Merchants Raising Rice Prices</p>
<p>Now Entrusting the Jiangsu Bank Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Department to Purchase</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Jiangsu Province Huai River Conservancy project officially began on the 1st of this month, enlisting a total of 165,000 laborers from various counties. The project is quite large. Jiangsu Finance Director Zhao Dihua, considering that the daily rice needs of these laborers are approximately 2,000 shi, or if using flour, 200,000 jin, sent staff to Gaoyou, Dongtai, and Zhengtong in Jiangbei to purchase food, intending to raise grain prices in Jiangbei and adjust the situation for disaster victims in Jiangnan. His intention was excellent, but many grain merchants did not understand this and saw it as an opportunity to profit. They purchased grain from farmers at low prices and arbitrarily raised prices to sell to the government, making purchasing difficult. He ordered purchasing personnel to temporarily halt purchases and entrusted the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to purchase instead. It is reported that after accepting the commission, the bank's Deputy Manager Hou Houpei made a special trip to Shanghai to contact the Jiangsu Bank headquarters' Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Office to negotiate the purchase of rice and flour, and sent staff to Wuhu and other places to negotiate purchases.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Woman is the Principal Culprit in Trafficking Red Pills</h3>
<p>Afraid of Arrest, She Fell and Was Injured While Climbing Out of a Window</p>
<p>Discovered During an Investigation of a Theft Case</p>
<p>Yulin Road detective Dong Yufu and detective Tang Pengfei, at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, cooperated with Western detectives to investigate a theft case at No. 59, Lane 713, Kunming Road. They were suspicious of No. 57 next door and saw that the local Li Shiyu and the Anhui maid Fei Zhang were having lunch at the table in the kitchen. They did not appear flustered. When they questioned them, the local Li Linsheng and the Anhui Fei Guangzhong suddenly came down from the stairs, their hands stained red. They were very suspicious. The detectives searched the upstairs and found a large quantity of the drug "red pills" in a wooden cabinet. There were 220 ounces of finished product and 504 ounces of raw material. The cabinet contained equipment for baking the pills, as well as scales, sieves, and rollers. Upon questioning, they learned that the principal culprit was a Huzhou woman, Zhang Wang, who was hiding at No. 82, Fengyu Lane, Saposai Road in the French Concession. The detectives arrested the four men and women, Li Linsheng, and went to the French Concession and, together with detectives from the police station, went to arrest Zhang Wang at the address. Seeing the Chinese and Western detectives arrive, she knew that she had been exposed. She climbed out of the window, trying to escape to No. 81 next door, but fell and was injured. She was arrested, and three account books were found in the room. A Jiaxing man named Yang Lunyuan, who had been keeping the accounts, was also arrested. Along with Li Linsheng and others, totaling one thousand people, and the evidence, they were taken back to the police station and detained separately. Zhang Wang was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, with the exception of Zhang Wang, they were all sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the events and requested a postponement. The various exhibits were inspected. Detective Huang then presented the investigation of the case. Judge Wu Zehan questioned each of the defendants and ordered that they be returned to custody separately and scheduled for re-examination.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fuzhang Sends a Letter to the Taxpayers Association Expressing His Views on the Election</h3>
<p>Supporting the Principle of Universal Suffrage</p>
<p>Zhou Fuzhang, standing committee member of the Seventh District Branch of the First Special District Citizens' United Association, sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association expressing his views on the association's election regulations, supporting universal suffrage for citizens. The letter stated: Esteemed Sirs, I, Fuzhang, am aware that your association is the highest group for protecting the rights of taxpayers in the Public Concession. For the sake of the citizens of the First Special District, you have fought fearlessly and unyieldingly against the Concession authorities. This glorious history is clear to all and does not need to be elaborated upon. However, in previous elections, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office and the Municipal Government had to be sent to supervise the elections, which demonstrates the seriousness with which your association conducts elections. However, I note that the annual elections of your association are divided into three groups: (1) the Citizens' Group, (2) the Native Place Group, and (3) the Commercial Group. Each of these three groups produces twenty-seven representatives, totaling eighty-one representatives. From these, twenty-seven executive committee members are elected, who then elect Chinese directors and committee members to bear the important mission of the several million taxpayers within the concession. However, those who are not respected and trusted by both Chinese and foreigners should not be allowed to fill these positions. Therefore, your association should be based on the entire citizenry within the Public Concession who have tax obligations; otherwise, they should not be entitled to the right to vote. Now that your association seeks a legitimate election, you have sent a notice to representatives soliciting opinions on the election regulations. Fortunately, representatives Zhang Yichen and Zhang Xianfang have proposed the standard of universal suffrage for citizens. I, Fuzhang, am concerned about the rights of Chinese taxpayers and dare not remain silent. Therefore, I have convened a general meeting of our association members to discuss this matter. It was resolved to agree with the election opinions of Representatives Zhang and others. I am sending this letter to your association for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Case of Indecent Monastic Behavior</h3>
<p>Further Trial Held Yesterday at the Special Court No. 1</p>
<p>Further Hearing Awaits Victim's Recovery</p>
<p>The monk Hui Tang, formerly ordained at the White Cloud Temple, was expelled from the temple for violating monastic rules. He then resided at No. 157 North Fujian Road. Around 3 PM on the 20th of last month, Hui Tang visited his friend Miao Yaoting at No. 224 nearby. Miao was out, leaving only his ten-year-old daughter, Miao Abao, at home. Hui Tang, seized by bestial instincts, brutally violated Abao. As Hui Tang suffered from gonorrhea, Abao was infected. The parents discovered the incident and reported it to the French Concession police. Detective Xie Zhiguang was dispatched to arrest Hui Tang and bring him before the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Miao Abao, after being violated, was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Doctors found that the severity of Abao's gonorrhea was quite high, making a quick recovery unlikely. Therefore, she remained hospitalized. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the trial at the Criminal Court No. 8. According to the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the victim Miao Abao is still in the hospital. The doctor said that a detailed examination would be conducted again this afternoon. If the gonorrhea is mild, she could be discharged in two or three weeks; otherwise, it would take at least two or three months. Therefore, she could not appear in court and a postponement was requested. Judge Wu ordered Hui Tang to be remanded in custody, and the case was postponed to the 14th for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Ferry Adds New Ships in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Contract Awarded to He Xing Shipyard</p>
<p>The Navigation Administration Department of the Hubei Construction Department, due to the rapid development of Wuhan ferries and the insufficient number of ships, planned to add two steel ferries to improve transportation. This was approved at a provincial government meeting. Subsequently, it was decided to name the new ships "Jian Xia" and "Jian Yang" and to invite bids in both Hubei Province and Shanghai. The first ship, "Jian Xia," has been contracted to He Xing Shipyard in Shanghai. The contract has been signed. The ship will be 110 feet long, 21 feet wide, 8 feet 6 inches deep, with a draft of 6 feet, a carrying capacity of 60 metric tons, and a speed of 14 kilometers per hour. The construction cost is 62,000 yuan, and the completion time is nine months. It will have water tanks, allowing it to operate even in strong winds and waves.</p>
<h3>Li Xiting Returns to Shanghai in the Yi Sheng Ship Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>One Killed by Gunshot, One Died of Illness</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yi Sheng Ship was robbed on the Fuzhou sea in March of this year. The pirates kidnapped six passengers before leaving, who had not been released for a long time. Recently, the ringleader released the hostage Li Xiting (partner of Shanghai Hua Chang Tai). Li has already returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to him, he experienced great suffering in the bandit's den. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Confined in a Mountain Cave The six kidnapped individuals were taken by the bandits to the coastal mountains in the countryside of Huizhou, Guangdong. They were held in a stone cave on a high mountain by the sea. The cave was very deep and wide and could accommodate many people. The six hostages were not kept together. Each hostage was guarded by two or three bandits. They were not allowed to leave the cave during the day, and they ate and slept in the cave. They were given a little more freedom at night. Every four or five days, they had to move to a different location, but still in the mountains. They were always moved at night to prevent them from knowing the route, only knowing that they were climbing mountains and crossing ridges.</p>
<p>Treatment Was Quite Good On the first day the six people were taken to the mountains, the bandit leader informed the bandits to slaughter a pig and hold a banquet to celebrate their victory. Each hostage was also given meat. The hostages were provided with meat and fish at every meal, three times a day, without interruption. After several months, Li Xiting became familiar with the bandits and was not closely guarded during the day. Sometimes he was even invited by the bandits to play mahjong, so he gradually gained freedom of movement. The bandits knew he had no property.</p>
<p>Negotiating Ransom In June, the bandits ordered each hostage to notify their families to pay the ransom. The first to negotiate was a Cantonese merchant who discussed the ransom in a Hong Kong hotel. As a result, he was released first for a price of 4,000 yuan. Among the remaining five people, only Li had no one come to Hong Kong to negotiate the ransom with the bandits. The bandit leader, wanting to understand the family circumstances of each hostage, secretly sent two henchmen to Shanghai and Guangdong to conduct secret investigations. Therefore, the bandits knew the true situation of each family.</p>
<p>Two People Have Died The hostages had been living in the mountain cave for a long time, and they could not adapt to the environment. All of them suffered from beriberi. One student from Beijing to Guangdong died of beriberi, causing his whole body to swell. The bandit leader had a doctor treat him, but he still died in the bandit's den. His body was thrown into the sea. Another hostage from Nanjing had his family send someone to Hong Kong. When they contacted the bandits, they secretly reported to the police, hoping to arrest the bandit representative. As a result, the bandit escaped back to the mountains. After reporting to the bandit leader, the bandit leader immediately dragged the hostage to the mountain, shot him with a pistol, and threw his body into the sea.</p>
<p>Reasons for Li's Release Li Xiting had some knowledge of medicine and physiognomy. Some of the bandits were suffering from venereal diseases, and some had scrofula. Li prescribed medicine for them, and they recovered. Li also told the bandit leader's fortune, which greatly pleased him. The bandits often called him Old Li. Li repeatedly asked to be released. The bandit leader promised to release him after the ransom for the hostages Zhang Zhengyu and He, the comprador of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, was settled.</p>
<p>Ransom Price of Two Hostages The families of Zhang Zhengyu and He negotiated with the bandits again in Hong Kong and reached an agreement. Zhang and He each paid 2,000 yuan, and they would be released upon arrival of the money. According to the bandit leader, they only got over 5,000 yuan on the Yi Sheng ship robbery. The total ransom for the six kidnapped people was only 8,000 yuan. Their expenses were huge, so this case was still a loss.</p>
<p>Li Has Arrived in Shanghai After the ransom for Zhang and He was settled, the bandit leader released Li Xiting. The bandit leader sent a bandit to take Li down the mountain and hired a fishing boat to take Li to Shantou. Li was held at the bottom of the boat, and a fishing net was pressed on his body to prevent him from knowing the route. The bandit gave Li travel expenses, and Li hired a long-distance bus ticket at Shantou and then took a train ticket at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station. All expenses to Hong Kong were paid by the bandit leader. After staying in Hong Kong for one or two days, Li took a Taikoo company ship to Shanghai. He has now safely arrived in Shanghai and has returned to Hua Chang Tai to work. He said that Zhang Zhengyu and He, the comprador, will be able to come soon.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Merchants in the Special Zone Petitioned the Public Works Department Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resulting in Representatives Being Sent to Await a Reply This Morning</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Oppose Registration and Request Relief Measures Be Determined</p>
<p>Rickshaw owners in the Special Zone, due to the illegal and excessive fines imposed by the Vehicle Committee, which undermine Chinese legal rights, petitioned the Public Works Department yesterday regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers. Both rickshaw owners and pullers submitted opposing petitions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Result The rickshaw owners in the Special Zone, due to the illegal and excessive fines imposed by the Vehicle Committee, which undermine Chinese legal rights, sent representatives Jin Chunlin, Wang Kunyi, Qiu Jiyang, Hou Shaoan, Hua Zhongfeng, Bao Zhenhuang, Zhao Rongnan, Lü Yuzhai, Yin Zhifang, Wang Runtao, and others, totaling over a thousand rickshaw owners, at 10 AM yesterday, to petition the Vehicle Committee and the Public Works Department. Their demands were: 1. Punish the Vehicle Committee for illegal and excessive collection of rent. According to the Public Works Department's vehicle regulations, violations by various vehicles are usually notified or warned to the owners in advance to allow them to explain their reasons. If they are not satisfied, they can petition the court for punishment. The Vehicle Committee ignores this and imposes penalties arbitrarily, which violates the vehicle regulations and undermines Chinese legal rights. This should be corrected. 2. The Vehicle Committee is organizing the registration of rickshaw pullers, with a deadline for owners to report. There are over 100,000 public rickshaw pullers in Shanghai, who have come to Shanghai to earn a living due to bankruptcies in the rural inland. The Vehicle Committee suddenly ordered that each rickshaw be registered for three pullers. How will the remaining 70,000 pullers be accommodated? This has not been stipulated. The registration measures should be implemented early to avoid turning 70,000 rickshaw pullers into starving corpses. 3. The hasty decision to change to a standard rickshaw that has not been practically suggested by rickshaw owners or pullers within one month should be withdrawn. 4. Rickshaw samples should be manufactured according to the agreement of August 6 to facilitate improvements. 5. The rickshaws and materials currently in operation by the owners should be allowed to be used up to maintain business and show consideration. The Public Works Department was received by He Dequi, and the Vehicle Committee was received by Chairman Maxi, who agreed to convey the requests for consideration. They set 9 AM this morning for rickshaw owners to send representatives to await a reply.</p>
<p>Submission to the Public Works Department Over a thousand registered rickshaw owners in the Special Zone jointly submitted a letter to the Director of the Public Works Department, stating: "Respected Sir, regarding the reforms to the rickshaw system by your bureau, the resolution stated that improvements should be made to the design of public rickshaws as soon as it is feasible. Considering the wording, improving the rickshaw design must consider whether rickshaw owners can afford it economically, whether the timing is appropriate, and whether the materials are suitable before implementation. This clearly implies waiting. Previously, our members believed that the Vehicle Committee's 13 proposed measures were all impossible to implement and repeatedly sent representatives and written requests for delays and leniency, but to no avail. On August 6, your Excellency, showing consideration for the difficulties of business and taking the facts into account, convened a meeting with rickshaw owner representatives to negotiate and agree that each rickshaw owner would reduce rickshaw rent and bear mutual aid fund expenses to help rickshaw pullers. Other issues could be discussed without causing significant damage to rickshaw owners. Regarding the rickshaw design improvement, it was agreed that it must be implemented after rickshaw owners and pullers have considered it and reached an agreement. This resolution was approved by your bureau's Board of Directors on August 7. Since this resolution has been agreed upon by both parties, rickshaw merchants should abide by it. However, not long after, the Vehicle Committee suddenly displayed a new rickshaw design that had not been practically suggested by rickshaw owners or pullers at the vehicle inspection station on Gongping Road as the standard for new rickshaws. All rickshaw owners were greatly alarmed because the design only emphasized aesthetics and was easily damaged, without considering the repairs for the owners, the burdens for the pullers, and the safety of the passengers. Such vehicles are difficult to use publicly. Representatives Gu and Hou were sent to visit the Chairman of the Vehicle Committee to explain the reasons. It was agreed that the guild would refer to the practical suggestions of rickshaw owners and pullers to create another sturdy and lightweight rickshaw sample to be submitted to the Vehicle Committee for approval. We complied with the instructions and made a sturdy and suitable rickshaw sample, which was 25 pounds lighter than the standard rickshaw sample set by the Vehicle Committee. We submitted it for review, but unexpectedly, on October 13, the Vehicle Committee suddenly announced the new rickshaw design, still using the previously autocratic rickshaw design as the standard, without adopting the practical suggestions of rickshaw owners and pullers. We sent representatives to negotiate with the Vehicle Committee, but they refused to discuss it, citing that the design had been approved by the Board of Directors of your bureau. Subsequently, on the 19th, the vehicle inspection station ordered that any slightly old vehicles must be replaced with new vehicles within one month. Within ten days, over a hundred vehicles had already been ordered to be replaced. Considering that there are over a thousand rickshaw owner households, most of whom only have one or two rickshaws, at a time when the market is sluggish, business is depressed, and they are heavily indebted, and they are also reducing rickshaw rent and paying mutual aid fund expenses in accordance with the new regulations, resulting in reduced income and increased burden, the Vehicle Committee, disregarding the difficulties of rickshaw merchants and violating the spirit of the agreement, secretly requested the Board of Directors to force the replacement of vehicles that are not suitable for public use. Even if rickshaw owners go bankrupt and rickshaw pullers lose their jobs, it will be difficult to comply with the order. Moreover, the 9,990 rickshaws currently in operation by rickshaw owners all comply with the designs designated by your bureau over the years and have passed the monthly inspections in accordance with the regulations. There are a large number of materials stored in preparation for operation. If they are discarded and not used, the loss is about one million yuan. The cost of making new rickshaws is also one million yuan. Rickshaw owners pay donations and obtain licenses to operate in accordance with the regulations, and their behavior is legal. The undue and additional losses suffered should be considered and compensated by your bureau to prevent rickshaw owners from going bankrupt, rickshaw pullers from losing their jobs, and affecting public security. We have always admired your Excellency's consideration for the difficulties of business and your overall view. We believe that you will not sympathize with this measure of the Vehicle Committee. Therefore, we specially submit this petition, requesting that the Vehicle Committee's (1) hasty decision to change to a standard rickshaw that has not been practically suggested by rickshaw owners or pullers within one month should be withdrawn, (2) rickshaw samples should be manufactured according to the agreement of August 6 to facilitate improvements, and (3) the rickshaws and materials currently in operation by the owners should be allowed to be used up to maintain business and show consideration. This is truly convenient for the public. We humbly request your compliance."</p>
<p>Joint Submission by Rickshaw Pullers Rickshaw puller representatives Chen Guoliang, Qian Youfu, Xu Qingzi, Xu Zhaoyuan, Yao Shengting, and over 50,000 others, are strongly advocating for the rickshaw puller registration issue. They submitted a letter to the Public Works Department stating: "We are submitting this letter to address the new regulations, which are ostensibly aimed at helping rickshaw pullers but are actually detrimental to them. The registration procedure requires verifying the rickshaw puller's physical health to qualify for registration; otherwise, registration will be denied, and the rickshaw puller will not be able to pull a rickshaw. In the Special Zone, there are 10,000 rickshaws, and each rickshaw company and contractor employs over 80,000 rickshaw pullers, which can be verified and examined in the records. These 80,000 rickshaw pullers are assigned work in two shifts, each shift lasting 12 hours. Each shift works every other day. One rickshaw worker pulls one shift and rests for one shift. Although each shift is scheduled for 12 hours, the shift change time is 3 PM. A physically strong rickshaw puller can work for a maximum of 8 to 9 hours per shift. It is difficult to pull any longer. Although the rickshaw rental for work is 12 hours, a rickshaw worker can pull a maximum of 14 shifts a month. Under the budget for renting a rickshaw, there are 62 to 63 shifts per month, including day and night shifts. There is also a type of rickshaw pulling by the old or the less skilled, who pull shifts to fill the 12 hours outside the 8 to 9 hours, called "pulling the rickshaw's rear end" at night. Under this calculation, 10,000 rickshaws have over 80,000 rickshaw pullers pulling rickshaws to make a living. Unexpectedly, your bureau's Rickshaw Committee's new regulations require 30,000 rickshaw pullers to register before they can pull rickshaws. What about the remaining 50,000 rickshaw pullers, whose families number over 100,000? How will their livelihoods be secured? If this new regulation is followed, ostensibly to help rickshaw pullers, it will actually leave the majority without food and send rickshaw pullers to their deaths. Where is the conscience? What is the intention? Once the registration procedure is opened, the livelihoods of these over 100,000 poor people will be cut off, leading rickshaw pullers to take risks. Who will be responsible for the problems that will inevitably arise from these poor rickshaw pullers? We request a reply to this. Regarding your bureau's measures to help rickshaw pullers, you repeatedly state that helping rickshaw pullers is the premise. For over a year, where is your bureau's Rickshaw Committee's record of helping rickshaw pullers? We request a reply to this. Is it possible to manage 10,000 rickshaws with 30,000 registered rickshaw pullers? We request a reply to this. If 30,000 rickshaw pullers are registered, how will the livelihoods of the remaining 50,000 rickshaw pullers be secured? We request a reply to this. Was the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society, organized by the Rickshaw Committee, legal? We request a reply to this. Is your bureau repeatedly advertising for public rickshaw registration to collect a 30,000-yuan registration fee from rickshaw pullers? We request a reply to this. Our union has been approved by the Central Party Headquarters' Mass Movement Guidance Committee and is not an informal organization. We have repeatedly petitioned your bureau to withdraw the rickshaw puller registration order, but your bureau has not corrected it for many days. In all respects, it harms the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers. Our association expresses dissatisfaction and especially requests again that the rickshaw puller registration order be withdrawn. Is this appropriate? We await your prompt instruction and command with anticipation."</p>
<h3>The Bloody Case After the Divorce of Er Herui</h3>
<p>Injured by the Two Younger Brothers of His Divorced Wife</p>
<p>Hospitalized for a Month, He Came to Court Ill Yesterday</p>
<p>—The Defendant Denies Everything—</p>
<p>Er Herui, from Tianjin, is 41 years old. He used to work in the Feng Army in the three northeastern provinces. Recently, he has been working in the import and export department of the Salomon Foreign Company on Sichuan Road in Shanghai. A year ago, he married Liang Peiling (26 years old this year), a woman from Zhongshan, Guangdong. They lived together for about a year after the marriage. However, due to the woman's frequent social activities, the couple had disagreements. They agreed to divorce between the summer and autumn of this year. The two sides disputed over alimony. The woman was dissatisfied with Er. On the night of September 30, Er went to the residence of the famous film director Wang Cilong at No. 43 Shencheng Lane, Gansidong Road, French Concession, to discuss something. Liang Peiling found out and invited her younger brothers Liang Yuegu (20 years old), Liang Yuehan (18 years old), and her sister Peiqin (24 years old, married to Jin Xiangyi, a sound film engineer who studied in the United States and is currently the engineer of the Cathay, Grand Theater, Great Shanghai, and other movie theaters) and their mother to Wang Cilong's house.</p>
<p>At Wang Cilong's House Yuegu and Yuehan entered the house and called Er Herui out to reason with him. Er, not expecting trouble from the Liang brothers, walked out of Wang Cilong's backyard with the film director Wang Ying, who was from Shandong. He was immediately attacked by Yuegu and Yuehan with knives and axes, and sustained injuries to his head and arms. The assailants fled. Wang Cilong hired a car to take the injured Er Herui to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He reported it to the French police and engaged Qu Cheng as his lawyer, who filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, charging Liang Yuegu, Liang Yuehan, Liang Peiling, and Liang Peiqin with aggravated assault under Article 295 of the Criminal Law, accusing them of using knives and axes to intentionally inflict serious harm to vital parts of his body, causing permanent disability, and requesting that they be severely punished according to the law. The court reviewed the complaint and summoned them once, but the plaintiff was seriously injured and did not come to court, so the hearing was postponed. Yesterday, Judge Xiong Huiping continued the trial in the Criminal Court No. 2. The plaintiff Er Herui had not yet recovered from his injuries.</p>
<p>Head Wrapped in White Cloth He was escorted to the court by his family. The defendants, except for Peiqin, came to court with their defense lawyer. The judge asked the plaintiff Er Herui, "Did you say to the police that you were unwilling to report the incident?" Er replied, "I slept in the hospital for 29 days after I was injured. How could I go to the police to say this?" The judge showed Er a copy of the reconciliation agreement, which was sent by the police after investigating the case, and asked, "Is this your signature?" Er replied, "Regarding this signature, I was in the hospital and, when I was under anesthesia, her (referring to Peiling) sister came and held my hand to sign it. I was so seriously injured. How could I be unwilling to report it? Moreover, Wang Ying was present when I was attacked." While speaking, he showed the injuries on his head and right fingers to the court for inspection. "I accuse Yuegu of holding an axe and Yuehan of holding a knife to attack me. According to Wang Ying, Liang Peiling, Liang Peiqin, and their mother were also present, so I am accusing all four of them." The judge questioned Yuegu and Yuehan, and they all denied using</p>
<p>Knives and Axes to Injure The Plaintiff. Yuehan claimed that he was injured in the right arm by the plaintiff because the plaintiff came to hit his sister, etc. Liang Peiling testified that she divorced him because he often beat her. Because she introduced Er to borrow 400 yuan from someone before, and after the divorce, the creditor demanded this money. She went to Er's place on September 30 to get the money. Er gave her a 50-yuan bank check and then asked her to go upstairs to talk, but she refused. He snatched back the check, scolded her, chased her out, and slapped her. After she returned home, her younger brothers returned, and after she told them what happened, they went to reason with Er, resulting in a fight. She rushed up to persuade them and was also hit on the head, causing bleeding, etc. At this point, the judge called the witness Wang Ying to testify that he saw Yuegu holding an axe and Yuehan holding a knife to commit the crime. He went up to persuade them and was also cut on his right arm, but fortunately, he was not injured. Wang Cilong testified that he did not see the crime. At this point, the judge ordered a postponement to investigate the signature problem with the police and then summon witnesses for questioning. He also ordered the plaintiff Er Herui and the defendants Liang Peiling and Liang Yuehan to go to the hospital today to await a forensic examination and ordered Yuegu, Yuehan, and Peiling to post bail pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Vehicle Committee Meets with Rickshaw Owner Representatives</h3>
<p>At 10:15 AM on Monday, ten representatives from the rickshaw guild went to the Public Works Department. The Vehicle Committee received them and first discussed the issue of eight rickshaw owners being fined for overcharging rickshaw fares. The rickshaw owners expressed their objections. The committee replied that according to the license regulations, the licenses of these vehicles could be revoked. However, because the Vehicle Committee was handling such violations for the first time, it did not fully exercise its authority and only suspended the licenses for one month. However, to avoid rickshaw pullers suffering from not having a rickshaw, the Vehicle Committee could withdraw the order to suspend the licenses, provided that the eight rickshaw owners each voluntarily donated 20 yuan to the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society to show compensation. Subsequently, the representatives still expressed some doubts about the evidence of overcharging rickshaw rent. The Vehicle Committee replied that each case had two witnesses, but the Vehicle Committee could not force the rickshaw pullers to confront the rickshaw renters because rickshaw pullers had suffered greatly in the past for publicly reporting the facts, so the Vehicle Committee could not force rickshaw pullers to come forward. The rickshaw owners then asked whether the rickshaw pullers selected by the rickshaw owners would have obligations to the selecting owner after being registered. The Vehicle Committee replied that there was no such interpretation. The rickshaw owners also asked what would happen to those who were left out after 40,000 rickshaw pullers were registered (30,000 recommended by rickshaw owners and 10,000 more to be registered). The Vehicle Committee said that this business could only support so many rickshaw pullers. If there were no restrictions on the number of people, competing to rent rickshaws, the living conditions of rickshaw pullers would not improve. Also, those who were not registered could pull rickshaws elsewhere outside this district. The Public Works Department could not take any responsibility for unregistered rickshaw pullers. The representatives then left, but indicated that there might be other issues that needed to be discussed with the Vehicle Committee. The Vehicle Committee replied that they could be received at any time and were welcome to discuss.</p>

<h3>Intense Competition Between Chinese and Foreign Insurers for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Four New Ships</h3>
<p>In order to revitalize the national shipping industry, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSN) previously negotiated a loan of over five million yuan with the Central Gengkuan Committee to build the Hai Yuan, Hai Heng, Hai Li, and Hai Zhen ships in the United Kingdom. These have now been completed. The Hai Yuan has already arrived in Shanghai, and the other ships will arrive in succession. The CMSN, given the importance of the matter, adopted a bidding system for the insurance of the ships. None of the domestic Chinese insurance companies have the capacity to undertake this business, and none of the foreign companies have the ability to bear this burden alone. Therefore, any company that undertakes the insurance must share the responsibility with other companies. It is reported that both British, American, and Chinese companies submitted bids, and their prices were similar. However, the CMSN intends to have a British company handle the insurance. Among the companies that submitted bids, only two are British. One is very insistent and unwilling to share any of the responsibility with Chinese companies after undertaking the insurance. The other is willing to have Chinese companies share half of the insurance amount after undertaking the insurance. Therefore, the Chinese insurance industry is very dissatisfied. The CMSN is a state-owned enterprise, and although the ships were purchased with British Gengkuan loans, it is a joint venture with the central government. Therefore, the insurance amount should be split equally between Chinese and foreign companies to be fair. Therefore, they are currently in contact with Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the CMSN. It is said that the annual premium for the Hai Yuan, Hai Heng, Hai Li, and Hai Zhen ships will reach several hundred thousand yuan, which is a substantial amount in the insurance industry.</p>
<h3>Grandeur of the Chrysanthemum Exhibition in Qingyang Port Held by Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, to encourage people from all walks of life to appreciate chrysanthemums, held a Chrysanthemum Exhibition at the Qingyang Port Railway Garden Hotel. This chrysanthemum exhibition differs from others in that it does not only display chrysanthemums planted by the organizers themselves, but also gathers exhibits from chrysanthemum experts in Shanghai, Zhenru, Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places, totaling more than a thousand pots. It collects the strengths of many, so there are many rare and unusual varieties. Moreover, the location combines the beauty of mountains and waters, with clear and beautiful scenery. In addition to appreciating the chrysanthemums, visitors can also enjoy the scenery. The exhibition opened on November 3rd in a sunny and warm atmosphere. Around a thousand people from China and abroad came to visit. At around 10:00 AM, Central Committee member Cheng Tianfang, Kunshan County Magistrate Peng Baichuan, the first Director of the Railway Zhong Wenyao, representatives from various organizations such as the Hangzhou Municipal Government, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Education Bureau, as well as various judges, arrived one after another. They were welcomed by Deputy Director Wu, Director Xu of the General Affairs Department, Deputy Director Cao, and Deputy Director Liu of the Transportation Department, who led them on a tour to admire the various famous chrysanthemums. A banner with the words "Chrysanthemum Exhibition" was placed at the garden gate, and a signing area was set up inside the gate. Each visitor was given a chrysanthemum exhibition commemorative badge, a ballot, and a color-printed chrysanthemum postcard titled "A Flock of Geese Singing in the Clouds," which was the masterpiece of painter Sun Fuxi. Route signs were placed along the way, and chrysanthemums were displayed on both sides of the path. The rest were arranged under bamboo sheds, on stone platforms, in front of flower houses, and around lotus ponds, either stacked high like mountains, placed singly on the ground, or arranged around gardens, with twists and turns, creating a variety of changes within the order. The exhibits from various places and gardens were still displayed separately and not mixed up. The chrysanthemum mountain was made of wooden steps, either in the shape of a square pyramid or a triangular prism. The two ends of the triangular prism formed a triangle, each covered with a triangular white cloth, on which the names of famous scenic spots were written. The route was surrounded by lead wire as a railing, and the exit was located at the gate drink, next to the ballot box, for guests to cast their votes to evaluate the grades of each flower. At noon, a banquet was held for the guests in the corridor, where Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng of the Railway Administration gave a speech, the general idea of which was that the chrysanthemum exhibition was fortunate to have the enthusiastic participation of various gardens, the enthusiastic support of the local government, the generous appointment of judges by celebrities from all walks of life, and the guidance of distinguished guests, enabling the railway to achieve this grand event in the shortest possible time. He expressed his deep gratitude to the colleagues and explained the purpose of holding the chrysanthemum exhibition. Finally, he expressed his hope that the guests would not hesitate to give their guidance on any inadequacies in the facilities or inappropriate arrangements, and that all sectors would continue to provide assistance for the continued holding of the chrysanthemum exhibition next year. After the banquet, the guests and hosts took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. Central Committee member Cheng Tianfang presented a horizontal plaque inscribed with the words "Holding Essence and Chewing Flowers," and the famous painter Xie Gongzhan painted two chrysanthemums and then inscribed the words "The Glory of Two Roads" in the courtyard, which added a lot of color to the exhibition. November 4th happened to be a Sunday, and the weather was excellent. The number of visitors from all walks of life reached a thousand, similar to the grandeur of the opening day.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Elopes with Paramour and Dies in Another Village</h3>
<p>Court Investigation Confirms Facts</p>
<p>Old Mother Cries Upon Hearing News</p>
<p>—Arguments Concluded, Sentence to Be Announced on the 9th—</p>
<p>Ding Xu, housewife of the Changfa Grocery Store at No. 401 Route LaFayette in the French Concession, has two daughters. The elder daughter, Xiuzhen, is already married. The younger daughter, A'duo, is seventeen years old and still unmarried. Due to financial reasons, A'duo works at the Dali Sock Factory nearby. Last year, she fell in love with Zhao Xiren, a factory worker from Anhui. On the 13th day of the first month of this year, A'duo eloped with Zhao to his hometown in Anhui without her mother's knowledge. It wasn't until June of this year that Xu learned of the situation through Zhao's friend, Wu Meigong, and entrusted Wu to bring clothes and other items to Anhui and hand them over to A'duo. At that time, A'duo was sick in bed and soon passed away. Wu immediately came to Shanghai to report to Xu. Xu did not believe him and mistakenly thought that he was colluding with Zhao. She then hired lawyer Ni Jiong to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhao Xiren for abduction and Wu Meigong for fraud with the Second Special District Court. The court approved the charges and ordered them to be summoned. The defendants arrived at the court one after another and testified to the previous situation. Xu claimed that she did not know whether her daughter had died or been sold after being abducted and requested an investigation. The judge ordered Zhao to be detained and Wu to be dismissed, and ordered a letter to be sent to She County, Anhui, for investigation and then returned for further questioning. It is now known that the Second Special District Court received a reply from the She County government stating that A'duo had indeed died of illness. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiong held a hearing to continue the interrogation. The plaintiff, Ding Xu, and her lawyer arrived at the court. After the court announced the letter from She County, Xu cried uncontrollably. She then recounted the circumstances of her daughter's abduction. When questioned, Zhao Xiren admitted to having a relationship with A'duo, but claimed that the girl's mother knew about it beforehand and that they intended to come to Shanghai to get married. Unfortunately, A'duo died of illness. He asked for leniency. Wu Meigong testified that he was entrusted by the plaintiff to go to the countryside to find her and did not know how she was abducted. He was being falsely accused. After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered the arguments to be concluded and announced that the sentence would be announced on the 9th. Zhao was still detained pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>"Diplomatic Yearbook of the Late Qing Dynasty" To Be Published</h3>
<p>A Monumental Work Compiled After the "Historical Materials on Diplomacy in the Late Qing Dynasty"</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Historical Materials Compilation Office at No. 7 Nandian, Beiping, was founded by Wang Yanwei and his son. They collected all the diplomatic memorials, edicts, letters, and telegrams from the sixty to seventy years of the late Qing Dynasty and compiled them into the book "Historical Materials on Diplomacy in the Late Qing Dynasty." It was exquisitely printed on Julianzheng historical paper, totaling 120 volumes. Hu Shih and others wrote prefaces, praising it as one of the nine great treasures of Chinese historical materials in the last forty years. Many people in Europe and the United States subscribed to it, especially the Japanese, which shows the concern of foreigners for our country's diplomacy. In recent years, Wang's son, Xiyin, has expanded the book, compiling the "Western Expedition Chronicles," "Diplomatic Historical Materials of the Xuantong Dynasty," and a three-book index to the entire book, and attaching sixteen exquisitely printed maps. All have been published one after another. The total number of books has increased to 160 volumes. Still, he believes it is not enough.

With one reading, the major diplomatic events of the late Qing Dynasty are clearly understood. The historical materials are sold together, and the special price for the entire book is only ninety yuan.</p>

<p>As he said this, he went to the well. He lowered a rattan basket, and the pulley creaked upward for a while, until the entire roll of rope was used up. Only then did the old man turn the pulley handle for about a minute, reeling up the rattan basket. Zhichuan was also very curious and wanted to see how deep this well was, that it would use up such a large roll of rope. When he walked to the well and looked inside, it was dark and he could not see the bottom. The old man held the rattan basket with both hands, preparing to lift it up and drink. Zhichuan said, "Is this water clean? Why can't you drink it?" The old man put down the rattan basket, and used a tile bowl on the ground to scoop a large bowl for Zhichuan to see, extending his hand and smiling, "Would you drink this kind of water?" When Zhichuan looked, the water in the bowl was yellowish, and there were some fine thread-like impurities floating on the surface, so he could not see the bottom of the bowl. Then he said, "It's so muddy, do you usually drink this?" The old man smiled and nodded. Zhichuan said, "Ah! Only today do I know that the water is so bad. This is really detrimental to hygiene." The old man smiled and said, "Don't worry, sir. You drink water from the West Gate. The Little Western Paradise spends more than a hundred yuan a month on drinking water." As he spoke, he picked up the bowl, again preparing to drink. Zhichuan repeatedly shook his head and said, "You don't have to drink this. Cold water is not good to drink casually, and it's even worse to drink this kind of cold water. If you're not feeling well, you'll get even sicker. Since you said I drink West Gate water, I have hot tea in my room, you can go and drink two bowls." The old man looked at him and smiled, "Sir, how can I?" He paused and couldn't go on. Cheng Zhichuan smiled and said, "You are a tile worker, I am a painting teacher, no need to be polite, come on." The old worker didn't care about drinking his tea, he felt that this person was very kind, although he couldn't make friends with him, talking a few words with him was also pleasant. Sure enough, he followed behind him to outside his room. When he reached the door, he stopped. Zhichuan waved his hand and said, "Come in? It's okay." (57)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Dragon Flies Fast</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>The ships that travel between Su and Mountain, we Dongshan people call it "Dragon Flies Fast" because it is faster than ordinary ships. When sailing, four oars are used on both the stern and bow. When there is a tailwind, sails are raised in addition to oar rowing, so even small steamships can't compare. Its route is from Xukou and Mudu, exiting Taihu Lake and traveling directly to Dongshan, unlike small steamships that take the winding inland river, saving a lot of time.</p>
<p>Everything to eat and use in Dongshan can be entrusted to "Dragon Flies Fast" to buy. The ship will faithfully handle everything for you as promised. They are very happy for you to entrust them with bringing things. They can get some kickbacks from the stores, and also get some "water feet" from the people who entrust them with bringing things. Therefore, their ships are always loaded with important things when they return to the mountain.</p>
<p>Before small steamships were running, the business of "Dragon Flies Fast" was really good. Not only did they carry goods, but also travelers would definitely take their ships. They were also very accommodating to passengers, charging 40 cents for a ride and providing a lunch with two meat dishes and one vegetable dish. If you felt bored sitting on the ship, "Hengjing Shaoxing Wine" was available for sale. For those who didn't like drinking, they could lie down in the cabin. Therefore, although passengers were crowded in this low cabin, they didn't feel the loneliness of the journey.</p>
<p>Now it's different. The small steamship business is also very competitive. From one ship, it has grown to three. Everyone is selling tickets at low prices. Like last year, sitting in the "shed" only cost 20 cents, and the facilities were also better and the seats were comfortable. "Dragon Flies Fast" is beyond reach and will naturally be eliminated.</p>
<p>What "Dragon Flies Fast" hopes for most is to encounter a big flood or drought. Small steamships can't travel when the water is too shallow or too high. Shallow draft and bridge clearances both hinder their travel. Like the great drought this summer, "Dragon Flies Fast" did good business. When the water was very shallow and the ship couldn't move, they would carry the ship by towing it or pulling it through the water. However, the fare was a bit higher, requiring one yuan per passenger, and lunch also had to be paid for separately. However, this business is not always available. It is really too pitiful to do some business during times of disaster.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Wang Shouqiu)</p>
<p>If someone saw four hundred million yuan in banknotes being burned in a fire, whether they were a miser or a generous person, they would sigh, right? But now, in the blink of an eye, our fireworks, cigarettes, cost four hundred million yuan every year, why doesn't anyone sigh!</p>
<h3>True Picture of the Disaster in Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong Counties</h3>
<p>— Shen Chu</p>
<p>Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong counties have long been known as lands of happiness. The rice, wheat, sorghum, beans, cotton, and homespun cloth produced are not only sufficient for self-sufficiency, but also have a large amount of exports. However, in recent years, agricultural production has been poor, side businesses have failed, and the people's livelihood has become unbearable. This year, they have suffered another major disaster, with no hope for the autumn harvest. Villagers are suffering from hunger and cold. The deep hidden dangers affect not only the people of these three counties, but also Shanghai, which is adjacent to these three counties.</p>
<p>In recent years, the three counties of Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong have lacked water conservancy repairs. Droughts and floods have occurred suddenly without prevention. Farmers are also sticking to old ways and not making improvements, resulting in yields that are constantly insufficient to make a living. What they rely on to supplement their lives is sericulture and textiles. However, the sericulture industry has declined and disappeared due to falling silk prices. The hand-weaving industry, due to the fact that the places where homespun cloth was sold were under the control of the puppet state, has faced high tariffs, almost 50 percent, and sales have been cut off. The people's livelihood in these three counties, even with a bountiful autumn harvest, would be difficult to make ends meet, let alone after years of poor harvests, with accumulated problems that are difficult to reverse, and this year's drought followed by pest damage, resulting in no hope for the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of Haimen and the entire territory of Qidong, agricultural products are almost entirely coarse grains. This year's severe drought has left the land barren for miles, with no harvest at all. In the western part of Haimen and the southeastern area of Nantong, cotton production is the main source of income. In the summer, there was a drought, followed by widespread pest damage to the flowers and fruits. During the autumn harvest, there was continuous rain, and all the remaining flowers and fruits rotted. The cotton yield is only two or three catties per mu, or even calculated in liang. The remaining parts of Nantong, although still better, have only achieved 30 to 40 percent of the harvest. However, there are even those who mistakenly hear about a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>Farmers in the three counties, with years of accumulated deficits, lack storage. In areas where coarse grains are planted, they have suffered a drought and lost their entire harvest. Famine is inevitable in the spring. Even in the northern part of Qidong and the southern reclamation area of Nantong, some people are already filling their stomachs with bean husks. It is no wonder that before winter precautions can be taken, banditry has already intensified. It is inevitable that things will become even more unimaginable near the Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Enlightened gentry in the three counties are deeply concerned about the hidden dangers and have started to organize disaster relief and plan to open up a central river for relief. The central river is a giant river that runs through Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong counties, facilitating transportation and irrigation. Twenty years ago, the local gentry Liu Huiding proposed building it, but unfortunately, he died before completing his great work. In this time of famine, continuing this great undertaking would not only provide food and clothing for the farmers suffering from hunger and cold, but would also bring benefits to the people of the three counties for thousands of years.

<h3>The Eve of Destruction</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<h3>Record of Imperial Fragrance Drifting</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager had already been carried in by the sixteen eunuchs outside the door, she still couldn't arrive immediately. So, while kneeling and waiting for Her Old Highness, I stole another glance around. This time, the view was clearer than before: I saw that the shapes of the large buildings, although somewhat different from those in Beijing, had obviously undergone some modification, no longer resembling the old palaces of centuries ago. These modifications and renovations were all planned by Emperor Qianlong. Seeing his handiwork, we cannot help but yearn for the literary talent and martial prowess of this wise and upright statesman, and develop a warm admiration.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, the Empress Dowager's imperial carriage was slowly carried in through the central gate, and the monotonous and dull ancient music was still being played; but the atmosphere was extraordinarily solemn, like a person alone in a desolate ancient temple, worshiping a ferocious and terrifying statue. The solemn and awe-inspiring situation is beyond description. We only heard a rustling sound of footsteps on the stone steps, and knew that the imperial carriage was about to ascend the hall; but everyone still held their breath and prostrated, and no one dared to look up. Then, we heard the sound of the imperial carriage landing, as light as the sound of wind blowing leaves. Because the sixteen eunuchs were all extremely cautious and careful, of course there would be no loud noise. After they put the imperial carriage down from their shoulders, they hurriedly knelt down on the nearby open space, forming another pile of colors; and at the same time, the Empress Dowager's jade feet began to tread on the land of her hometown.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager must have peeked through the gaps in the curtain on her way in, but what she could see was of course very little and very unclear; therefore, as soon as Her Old Highness got out of the carriage, she stood and looked around as much as possible with a very concerned expression. (167)</p>
<h3>We Are the Orientals</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shouruo)</p>
<p>During a casual chat among friends, we happened to talk about Orientals—the Japanese. One friend said, "It is fundamentally wrong to call the Japanese Orientals." I thought the Japanese had always been called Orientals, so why is it wrong? I couldn't help but argue.</p>
<p>In the end, at the end of the debate, I thought that victory should belong to my friend; because his argument was based on facts and reasons. He said, "During my school days, I heard Mr. Yao Minghui, a teacher of classics and geography, say that the West and the East are equivalent names. China is a vast and resource-rich country and should be the master of the Orient. Japan is a small island nation and is not qualified to represent the Orient. Therefore, it is right for Chinese people to be called Orientals; if we let the Japanese be called Orientals alone, that is absolutely wrong." In that case, we should all be proud to be called Orientals, and we should not give up our rights and let the Japanese take advantage.</p>
<p>My friend also mentioned that Mr. Yao Minghui always wrote the words "Pacific Person" on the hat he wore. Considering his intentions, how broad they were, thinking that only China could exclusively dominate the hegemony on the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>What about the arrogance of the small Japanese people today? What about the situation in the Pacific? It can't help but make us, the ideal masters, sigh with emotion!</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3>Huzhou Brush</h3>
<p>— Bing Yuan</p>
<p>Brushes produced in Huzhou, Zhejiang, which are commonly known as "Huzhou Brushes," have a long history and a great reputation! However, only mixed-hair brushes are produced, and there are no goat-hair brushes. Since the monk Zhi Yong invented the art of making brushes with pure goat hair, goat-hair brushes in Huzhou opened a valuable record. According to historical records, Zhi Yong was based in Yong Sheng Temple in Shanlian Town, Huzhou, so even today, Shanlian Town is still famous for brush production. Brush-making workshops are lined up one after another, everywhere you look. Roughly speaking, among the residents of the town who make a living by brush-making, there are five out of ten families. Don't underestimate this small production industry; it does indeed occupy a large position in China's light industry. In recent years, all regions have been shouting about rural bankruptcy and the extinction of livelihoods, but fortunately, this brush industry has not yet shown a distressed situation. Even taking Shanlian Town as an example: every year when the goods are shipped out, merchants and peddlers from all over the country come to purchase them, and the market situation seems to be no different from before.</p>
<p>Mixed-hair brushes are made of rabbit hair and goat hair combined. The raw materials, rabbits and goats, are all obtained from Fengjing, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Shihudang, Zhouwangmiao, Wangdian, Xiqiao, Chang'an, Xucun, and Linping. This is because the goats and rabbits produced in the above-mentioned places are actually superior, and are especially suitable for brush-making. It is said that each brush must go through twenty to thirty steps. The method: Regarding the cleaning of rabbit hair, first take the raw hair, soak it in boiling water to soften it, take it out, comb it with a specially made comb, and then cut it with a knife. If it is goat hair, after the same cleaning, it must be steamed again, and after the knife is cut evenly, divide it into layers, wrap it in paper, pick it to make it even, trim it to make it clean; in the middle, use a small red-hot iron to finely iron the hair roots, arrange them flat, without force to curl them again, check the heat, just right, then inject glue into the tip of the hair, and the great work of a brush is initially completed. Therefore, all fine brushes, called the "Su" character, mean that their "old dirt" has been completely removed and no longer exists. Regardless of goat hair or rabbit hair, their nature is curved and has resilience. If you want it to be smooth, straight, soft, and obedient, and can be guided by the wrist when writing, it all depends on the "soaking," "steaming," "trimming," and "ironing" in the manufacturing process. The deeper the skill, the finer the brush produced!</p>
<p>There are many types of brushes. In addition to rabbit hair, there are also sable, wolf, and chicken hair, which are also used for large-scale brush production; however, they must be mixed with goat hair to be suitable. Rabbit hair comes in three colors: black, white, and gray; brushes called "purple hair" are made of black rabbit hair, and their nature is also stiffer than other colors. The shape of rabbit hair also has square, flat, and triangular distinctions. Triangular shapes are absolutely unsuitable for brush-making. If a triangular hair is unintentionally mixed into a brush, even if it is just one, then this brush, no matter how well-made it is, is useless. Even if it is forced into the bulk sales and purchased by an unfortunate customer, he will be greatly affected when writing! As the saying goes, "Good calligraphers do not choose their brushes," I don't think this is true. It must be known that "if a workman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." Not only for calligraphy, this is the pertinent lesson. Therefore, brush-makers deeply hate triangular rabbit hair and must put in a lot of effort to select and examine the materials. However, the method of discrimination is entirely based on eyesight.</p>
<p>Regarding the brush industry, there are large and small categories. The raw materials for making large-character brushes are mostly taken from pig bristles and horse mane. However, those who make large brushes cannot make small brushes, and those who make small brushes do not know how to make large brushes. There is no doubt about this. Huzhou brushes belong to the small-character brush category, and they have never been involved in making large-character brushes. I remember that during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a Japanese man deeply admired Chinese brushes, especially Huzhou brushes, for their excellent manufacture. He specially went to Shanlian Town, Zhejiang Province, to visit a brush workshop with all his heart, presented sweet words, and offered generous gifts, requesting to learn the manufacturing method. The workshop was too embarrassed to refuse, so they accepted 300 yuan and agreed to teach him. This Japanese man only studied for three or four months, and understood everything. However, the Japanese are the most scheming people in the world, and he was still afraid that this workshop had not fully imparted its secrets. He often went to the east house and the west house, hoping to secretly investigate. However, he was unable to find the key, and had no choice but to leave in frustration!</p>

<h3>Concrete Implementation of the Ban on Dancing for University Professors and Students</h3>
<p>Professor and Student Self-Improvement Groups and Secret Investigation Teams</p>
<p>Director Pan Talks About the Need for Strict Supervision by Each School</p>
<p>Military Training Committee Indicates Strict Implementation of Military Training</p>
<p>Since the joint university conference resolved to strictly prohibit university students from entering dance halls to dance, it has aroused considerable attention from people in society. A Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday made special inquiries to various parties for their opinions, and the records are as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Supervision by School Authorities A Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday visited Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau to inquire about his opinion on the prohibition of university students from dancing. Pan said that university students entering dance halls to dance should of course be prohibited. As for how to prohibit it, it can only be done by strict supervision by the school authorities and by the example of the president and professors. As for sending police to the venue for arrests, it is realistically impossible, and most of the dance halls are located in the concessions, which is beyond the reach of the municipal government's police force.</p>
<p>Strict Implementation of Military Training According to a person in charge of the Municipal National Military Training Committee, the most effective way to prohibit university students from dancing is to strictly implement military training to cultivate students' disciplined life and the habit of enduring hardship. Therefore, military instructors in various schools should not only teach students to drill and attend classes, but also pay attention to the students' spirit and discipline at all times. They only hope that the university authorities can cooperate fully to assist, and the problem of banning dancing can be solved easily.</p>
<p>Professors Form Self-Improvement Associations Currently, a considerable number of university professors in Shanghai enter and leave dance halls. Most university professors who do not have a hobby of dancing agree with the point that professors should set an example in prohibiting students from dancing. They have jointly initiated the organization of a University Professors Self-Improvement Association, soliciting professors from various universities to participate, and have formulated a covenant. Those who join the association swear that if they are found dancing in a dance hall again, they will be punished according to the covenant after being reported.</p>
<p>Students Form Secret Investigation Teams According to the persons in charge of the student unions of Jiaotong, Soochow, Shanghai University, Great China, Fudan, and Business School, the students of various schools are currently preparing to organize secret investigation teams. Each evening, one person is dispatched from each school to secretly investigate various dance halls in this city. In addition to investigating and reporting students dancing at the venue to the school for punishment, if professors are found dancing at the venue, their names will be immediately announced.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Turmoil Subsides</h3>
<p>President Guo Arrives at the School Yesterday</p>
<p>(Hangzhou, 5th) Guo Renyuan returned to the school on the 5th to resume his duties due to the Ministry's firm retention. The turmoil at Zhejiang University has subsided.</p>
<h3>Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan Handles Registration of Those Without Certificates</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianwen, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, believes that it is inappropriate for self-funded students studying in Japan to come to study without having obtained a study abroad certificate in their home country. He recently organized the registration of students studying abroad without a study abroad certificate for investigation. Yesterday, he also reported it to the Ministry of Education of our country for the record.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih Talks About the Employment Problem of University Students</h3>
<p>Must Have the Ability and Knowledge to Take on Responsibilities</p>
<p>The Reason for Unemployment Should First Be Sought in Oneself</p>
<p>Hu Shih, Dean of the College of Arts of Peking University, recently came to Beijing to attend the examination and qualification conference. A reporter from Riri News Agency met him at his residence on the morning of the 4th and asked about the employment problem of university graduates. Hu said that due to the busy schedule of the conference, he could only make the following remarks: I teach at Peking University and have seen many university graduates. Except for a very small number who have special circumstances, most of them can find a decent job after graduation. There are even many who accumulate in the school because they do not need a diploma to find employment. The small number who cannot find employment is because they have learned but cannot apply it, especially those who study philosophy, whose avenues are narrower. For example, Gu Jiegang switched from studying philosophy to history, and Chen Gongbo also switched from studying philosophy to engaging in industry. Therefore, if you want to work happily and have no fear of unemployment, the first thing you must have is the ability and knowledge to take on responsibilities. Each year, the graduates of Yenching University can be snatched up by others in advance because the graduates of previous years have been able to give society a good impression after employment. On the other hand, those who cannot find employment after graduation should seek the reason why they cannot find employment. There is no need to blame heaven and earth, but only blame themselves. If you have ability, why worry about not having food to eat? As for unemployment relief, it is another social problem. Giving the unemployed jobs is also a real responsibility that society should fulfill.</p>
<h3>Employment Survey of Nanjing University Graduates</h3>
<p>Nanjing University graduated a total of 114 students in the last semester, including 18 from the College of Liberal Arts, 14 from the College of Science, 32 from the College of Agriculture, and 50 from the Agricultural School. According to the school's survey results, they are now all working in various places, and no one is unemployed.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Nantong Public Education Museum in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Tangshan Farmers Education Museum was completely moved to Nantong at the end of September this year and renamed the Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Public Education Museum. The museum's report on its work over the past year in 1933 shows that the public school is the central organ for implementing public education, with culture, politics, and economics as the goals of its efforts. First, it handles public school organization, alumni associations, charitable associations, etc., with language education as the center and political and livelihood education as the sum. Second, it establishes rural education advancement associations, with political education as the center and language and livelihood education as supplementary. Third, it handles cooperative agricultural extension and guidance, etc., with livelihood education as the center and language and political education as supplementary. These three implementations have already had considerable factual manifestations in eliminating illiteracy, improving rural society, and promoting agricultural production. Details are omitted. Regarding the work of the Guidance Committee, in addition to being responsible for researching and experimenting with public education academics and promoting its own business, the museum was also responsible for guiding the public education organs of various counties in Jiangsu Province to cooperate and promote the public education business of various counties. Subsequently, because there are still several provincial public education centers in Jinzhen and other places, the museum's inclusion of the entire province's guidance often overlaps with its business. In 1933, the hall issued provincial social education organs to guide various counties' social education methods, dividing them into six public education districts. The museum then specialized in guiding the social education business of Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Jurong, Jintan, Lishui, and Gaochun counties. It has prepared reports and statistics on the social education research and investigation matters of these eight counties. In order to increase the interest and intelligence of the staff of various county museums in handling cooperative businesses, it held a cooperative discussion meeting in Beijing during the summer vacation to lecture on rural economics and cooperative and practical issues (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo to Hold Goldfish Exhibition on the 18th</h3>
<p>Soliciting Products to End on the 15th</p>
<p>At the Same Time, Expanding the Garden Area and Improving the Cages</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Zoo has been open for more than a year since its opening. It has raised more than 60 kinds of animals, large and small, such as tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, peacocks, white cranes, pythons, and crocodiles. The number of visitors to the garden every day is extremely crowded. Recently, the garden held a goldfish exhibition and expanded the garden area and improved the aquatic animal house. Details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Holding a Goldfish Exhibition The garden, in order to promote the noble entertainment of citizens and seek to improve the varieties of goldfish, is scheduled to hold a goldfish exhibition on the 18th of this month. Since the announcement of the exhibition rules and the method of soliciting products, the number of people who have gone to register and register products in recent days has been extremely enthusiastic. The registration period is scheduled to end on the 15th. Those who raise good varieties of goldfish can register at the garden before the 15th so that they can be displayed at that time for exhibition. Excellent varieties from other places are also welcome to participate at the same time.</p>
<p>Improving Animal Greenhouse The garden originally had an aquatic pavilion, and the heating equipment installed inside was still insufficient in temperature after being burned and applied last winter. Tropical animals still have difficulty surviving the winter. In order to meet the needs, the garden has applied for funds to convert the original hot water pavilion equipment to hot air pipes to increase the temperature. It has now been completed. In addition, the entrance and exit of the aquatic animal house were originally in the center, and people watched from both sides. When the number of people was large, it was often crowded and impassable, and the order was very chaotic. The entrance and exit have now been changed to both sides, so that people can visit in order and do not have to go back and forth.</p>
<p>Actively Expanding the Garden Area The garden area of the garden is extremely narrow and insufficient for application. The existing Indian elephants, because there is no suitable place to be placed, temporarily set up temporary sheds in the deer sheds to raise the elephants in them. On the one hand, they are actively proceeding to buy seven points of civilian land connected to the southwest corner of the garden for the construction of elephant field houses. Currently, they are processing the purchase procedures and will soon be able to expand and apply.</p>
<p>Statistics of Visitors The number of visitors to the garden is really beyond expectations. In the past year, it has reached more than 1,189,000 people. The statistics of visitors in the last three months are as follows: a total of 50,907 people in August, a total of 94,589 people in September, and a total of 106,710 people in October, which is more than 26,000 more than the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park and the Zoo.</p>
<h3>Relocation of the Secondary School Education Association</h3>

<p>(Nanjing, 5th) The Ministry of Education ordered the various departments and bureaus to say that, according to the National Compilation and Translation Hall, all secondary school textbooks of various bookstores must be submitted for review and revision. The incomplete parts that have been submitted before must be submitted all at once during the next submission, and must not be submitted piecemeal, so as to facilitate review and restrict resources. The Ministry of Education also requested that the department and bureau immediately instruct various bookstores to comply with the order.</p>
<h3>Famous Epigrapher and Archaeologist Shan Cigang Appointed Professor at Pingyi College of Art</h3>
<p>Shan Cigang, a famous epigrapher and archaeologist from Yongjia, is proficient in all kinds of writing. When he was in Shanghai, every scrap of his paper was cherished as a treasure. It is said that he was hired by the National Art College of Ping a month ago as a professor of Sinology, and also teaches calligraphy in regular classes. Famous people in Ping, such as Hu Shih and Qian Xuantong, are all old friends of his. From then on, the educational circles in Peiping will have another expert.</p>
<h3>Educational Film Association Organizes Film Teaching Group</h3>
<p>The Education Bureau Orders Teachers from Various Schools to Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all primary and secondary schools in the city, stating that the Chinese Educational Film Association's official letter stated that the International Federation President Dr. Fei Ge's letter roughly stated that in order to develop the use of educational films as a teaching tool, it is proposed that teachers from various countries and schools at all levels who are willing to devote their time and energy to film education organize a film teaching group called the Teaching Film Vanguard, and a brief plan is prepared to entrust the organization of the Chinese film teaching group. Approved, the effectiveness of film teaching has attracted the attention of people in our country's education circles in recent years. The association's request should be supported to seek cooperation. However, the bureau's teachers at all levels of schools are quite numerous, and there are many who are interested in film teaching. In order to conduct a thorough solicitation, it is proposed that the bureau order the public and private schools at all levels under its jurisdiction to forward the inquiry to the teachers. If there are those who are willing to devote their time and energy to film education, the schools should submit the report to the bureau for collection and transfer, so as to start organizing a film teaching group for joint discussion. In addition to the separate letters, a copy of the original letter is enclosed. Please check and reply. Approved, all schools are hereby notified that if any teachers are willing to engage in film teaching, they should report it as soon as possible for collection and reply.</p>
<h3>Jinling Alumni Association Primary and Secondary School Salary Arrears Crisis, Teachers and Staff Petition the Education Bureau</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency, No. 339 Wuzhou Road, this city, Wang Huanzhang, the principal of the primary and secondary schools of the Jinling University Alumni Association, used all the tuition fees collected to repay debts, resulting in the teachers' salaries being unpaid for several months. Therefore, he repeatedly requested assistance from Chairman and School Director Wu Dongchu. After several consultations between the school directors and principals, the principal, accompanied by school director representative Wei Wenhan and others, talked to the teachers and staff, especially promising to pay salaries on November 1. The teachers and staff were overjoyed to hear the news, thinking that the rain was coming. Unexpectedly, a draft came suddenly on October 30, roughly stating that they would not be responsible for the salaries owed before November, etc. The teachers and staff were asked to sign their names before they could be paid, otherwise they would be ignored. The teachers and staff of the school believe that the arrears of salaries have been paid to the east and cannot be signed at all. They have repeatedly requested them, but they were not accommodated.

<h3>Key Points for Recent Improvements in Colleges and Universities by the Ministry of Education (6)</h3>
<p>According to the table on the right, the number of liberal arts graduates in 1932 decreased by 0.8% compared with 1931, and the number of science graduates increased by 0.8% compared with 1931. Analytically speaking, except for the increase in the number of liberal arts and commerce graduates in 1932 compared with 1931, the number of law and education graduates decreased, and the percentage of decrease was very large. Among science graduates, the number of science and medical graduates increased compared with 1931, and although the number of agriculture and engineering graduates decreased, the percentage of decrease was very small. From this, it can be proved that the number of liberal arts graduates has a decreasing trend, and the number of science graduates has an increasing trend, but the number of increases and decreases is not large. What we want to state here is that the graduates of 1932 were all those who entered school several years ago, so the number of liberal arts graduates decreased little, and the number of science graduates increased little. If a few more years pass, the number of liberal arts graduates in the country will definitely decrease much more than now, and the number of science graduates will definitely increase much more. Because we want to look at the effectiveness of emphasizing science and limiting liberal arts and law subjects from the item of graduates, we must wait a few more years, until the current students graduate, before we can see it.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of new students, the total number of new students admitted by various schools in 1932 was 10,352, and in 1933 it was 10,910. The departments are shown in the table on the left:</p>
<p>Department 1932 1933 Increase or Decrease in 1933 Compared with 1932</p>
<p>Liberal Arts 25.2% 26.2% +1.0%</p>
<p>Law 23.2% 21.0% -2.2%</p>
<p>Education 9.9% 7.7% -2.2%</p>
<p>Commerce 5.1% 5.3% +0.2%</p>
<p>Total 60.4% 60.2% -3.2%</p>
<p>Science 12.3% 17.3% +4.4%</p>
<p>Agriculture 4.4% 5.2% +0.8%</p>
<p>Engineering 13.3% 12.0% -1.3%</p>
<p>Medicine 6.0% 5.3% -0.7%</p>
<p>Total 36.6% 39.8% +3.2%</p>
<p>Looking at the table, in 1933, except for the slight increase in liberal arts and commerce students compared with 1932, the number of law and education students decreased by 2.2% each. In terms of science, only the number of engineering and medical students decreased slightly compared with 1932, while the number of science and agriculture students increased compared with 1932, and the increase in science students was the largest. Comprehensively speaking, the number of liberal arts students in 1933 decreased by 3.2% compared with 1932, and the number of science students increased by 3.2% compared with 1932. Here we can further prove the effectiveness of emphasizing science and limiting liberal arts and law subjects. Now the All-China Academic Work Consulting Office is preparing to conduct a detailed survey of the employment status of college and university graduates and the talent needs of various institutions and organizations. The Ministry of Education will use this as a basis to plan the development or restriction of various colleges and various specialized schools in the future. The enrollment quota in the future will be based on this for more detailed regulations.</p>
<p>In addition to the five points mentioned above, there are several important improvement items that must be reported incidentally: (1) Strictly implement inspections. The Ministry of Education must send personnel to inspect colleges and universities every year as a basis for improvement. Since April of this year, it has successively selected more than a dozen experts to conduct a comprehensive inspection of colleges and universities in order to obtain a comprehensive improvement plan. The inspection method adopts a departmental inspection system. A total of more than 40 schools were inspected. During the inspection, special attention was paid to students' attendance and absenteeism, teachers' attendance and absenteeism and concurrent jobs, the school's financial distribution status, students' level and examination status, curriculum, school discipline, library equipment and other preparations, sanitary equipment, military training and sports, etc. Now, according to the inspection report, orders have been issued for improvement separately. (2) Preparing to establish research institutes. In order to cultivate high-level academic talents and complete the highest stage of the education system, the Ministry of Education formulated and promulgated the regulations on research institutes this year. In addition to Peking University, Tsinghua University, Sun Yat-sen University, and other schools that have established research institutes and are actively reorganizing according to the new regulations, it will also prepare to establish research institutes in various departments in national universities that have achieved significant results. The Central University and Wuhan University, etc., have now been ordered by the ministry to start preparations. (3) Subsidizing private colleges and universities has been briefly mentioned in the previous item on enriching equipment. This subsidy was approved by the national treasury in the spring of this year to allocate 720,000 yuan annually as the subsidy amount for private colleges and universities. The subsidy standard focuses on science subjects, and the amount of support shall not be less than 70%. The subsidy items are equipment fees and teaching fees. A total of 41 schools applied for subsidies. After strict review by the review committee, it was decided to subsidize 32 schools. In terms of departments, science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine accounted for 80.7%, and liberal arts, law, commerce, and education accounted for 19.3%. In terms of fees, equipment fees accounted for 81.5%, and teaching fees accounted for 18.5%. In addition, such as ordering off-campus committee members to participate in graduation examinations, improving training and military training methods, urging schools to pay attention to the research of domestic practical problems, and banning private colleges and universities with poor performance, have all been implemented separately. There is no need to say more here. However, from the above points, colleges and universities across the country can be said to have made considerable progress. However, this kind of progress does not seem to be very big or very fast. Furthermore, quantitative progress is obtained from the average, and qualitative progress is obtained from a general inspection. If you look at it individually, the quantitative and qualitative progress is even more uneven. Therefore, the main task of the Ministry of Education at present is to make the average progress bigger and faster, and at the same time, to gradually make the individual progress more and more uniform. Schools that have no hope of progress will continue to be banned. It can be said that this is the central work of the Ministry of Education in improving colleges and universities in the future.

<h3>Realistic Archetypes and Others</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>In his article "Archetypes and Reality," Mr. Xin Ren attributes the reason why artistic works possess archetypes and must possess them to the difference between art and the camera, that is, the particularity of art - "...here, art has a great, enlightening, and educational power. Art is not a pastime for a few, but the most precious spiritual food for the majority. Therefore, if art is not archetypal, then it is only copying superficial phenomena, only writing about "the foam on the river," and cannot express "the huge current at the bottom of the river;" as a result, it degenerates into the distortion of reality, or the simplification and mechanization of reality. Such art is poisonous, or it loses its enlightening and educational power, and at the same time loses its qualification as art." I think this passage is quite confusing. This passage can be used to evaluate the social value of art, but it is at least not very appropriate for the question of why artistic works have archetypes and must have them.</p>
<p>My meaning is this: objective reality is multifaceted, and it is also archetypal; among these multifaceted aspects, there are also some of the most essential (archetypal) aspects. In order to grasp the essence of reality, art must delve into its core and tightly grasp the most essential, that is, the most archetypal, factors in the multifaceted aspects of reality. Thus, the archetypalization of art is precisely the archetypal reflection of reality that is expressed in and forms the basis of the image. Only by doing this can the work be essentially realistic. The archetypalization of art is not and cannot be established in order to maintain or improve the enlightening and educational effect; on the contrary, every great and epoch-making work is archetypal because it expresses the essence of objective reality (the most archetypal aspect of the multifaceted aspects of reality) in a specific historical stage through images. The non-archetypalization or typification of art is not only due to the writer's lack of artistic talent and expression, but also to the writer's superficial understanding of real life. The writer's method of understanding reality and the method of literary reproduction of reality are not the same, but the unified connection between them should be a self-evident fact. Therefore, in literary criticism, we must not only examine the effect of the formal techniques of a work in expression, that is, its positivity; but also examine the creative practice itself, that is, whether the work has correctly reflected the living objective reality. In this reflection process, does the writer's worldview promote this literary reproduction of reality, or does it obscure and even distort this expression? I must say that the worldview of a true philosopher contains very few contradictions, so the greatest artist should also be the one who completely achieves the unity of his worldview and creative method.</p>
<h3>Boat in a Rapid Current</h3>
<p>— Liu Fan</p>
<p>If you have traveled on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, if you have taken a Sichuan River boat, everyone knows the famous Qingtan! From Yichang, the river gradually begins to narrow, and the mountain peaks on both sides squeeze towards the middle of the river like duels. The further you go in, the tighter the squeeze. The river is forced into a line, and the water flows more rapidly, like struggling and angry, because the roar of the water can be heard from far away.</p>
<p>Then, the steamer pulls the long whistle again and again; this whistle, constantly echoes in the mountains louder than the original. The former is a warning to the crew, and the latter seems to encourage the ship's progress. The alarm in the engine room is ringing, the workers are carefully checking the machine, running at full power, refueling; the entire crew is mobilized, measuring the water on both sides of the bow with long bamboo poles, loudly shouting the depth of the water, and reporting the water level marked on the mountain stones at any time. The pilot on the stage, shrunk his heart, looking left, looking right, standing up, sitting down, and skillfully rotating the wheel to determine the direction.</p>
<p>The steamer advances like a "splitting water buffalo," but the water is like a naughty child, desperately plunging into the bow, running onto the deck, and in an instant, swallowing the bow, and then spitting it out again, swallowing again, spitting again, ... threatening with huge roars, and illusioning white waves with seduction. In short, she is using all her strength to stop the ship from advancing.</p>
<p>Be careful; the water is full of invisible rocks, as long as you touch one, one touch is enough, either the ship will be immediately broken, or at least there will be a big hole, perhaps too big to repair, and thus sink. It may cause a mess, a false alarm. It takes some effort to get ashore. It is hard to say that hitting a three-pointed stone can end this boat; but once you get to the beach, it is not easy to get back down. Often boats are neither up nor down, in a dilemma, and many sink because of this.</p>
<p>What a dangerous rapid, what a loud sound of water, but what beautiful waves, Many boats hesitated to move forward, looking at this turbulent beach, many boats sank on the beach stones, and many more bravely hit the beach. But never, never has a boat stayed on the beach for a long time:</p>
<p>I remember once, in the army, perhaps because we were defeated, our boat was stuck on the Qingtan for six hours, and it was hard to get up. The reason was that the chief pilot was sick, and the second pilot was acting on his behalf, and of course he was a little "clumsy" in terms of technology. The worst thing was that the most important machine on the boat, "the paddle wheel," was broken, and the ship's power was greatly reduced. At this time, everyone on the boat ran out of the cabin, all staring at the sky-high water and worrying. There was water everywhere, and one wave after another hit the face. The attacked hull could not move forward because the water force at this time was exactly the same as the ship force. The ship was steaming, and the machine vibrated more violently, trying to rush upwards; to the middle of the mountain, and then returned, rushing back and forth, because the ship's strength was too weak to smoothly rush through this dangerous beach.</p>
<p>Anger seized the hearts of everyone on the boat. Everyone complained about the pilot's dereliction of duty. Some people even wanted to leave the boat. They were desperate for the pilot and thought that it was impossible to get through this difficult beach, and this beach was still far from our destination (Sichuan). But in my heart, a funny thought arose at that time. I hated water. I felt that water did not understand that with a pilot who knew the route well, no matter how hard you tried, you could not stop it. Moreover, this ship must pass this beach, one hundred beaches, to reach the destination she wants to reach. Although if you are not careful, you will break it, although it may delay her voyage; but in the end, she must reach the place she wants to reach. Because too many people will die if they do not take this road, and there is only this road! I forgot that the nature of water is downward. She hates and resists anything upward, even though resistance is futile!</p>
<p>The pilot changed his route and ordered all the sailors and many passengers to jump on the bow, which could reduce the power of the water and strengthen the ship's resistance. Finally, he attacked the beach from the right side.</p>
<p>This taught me a lesson. The route, the pilot, and the machine all play a huge role in the ship's progress. I am even more aware that a boat in a rapid current either advances or retreats.</p>
<p>The journey of life is probably not different!</p>
<h3>Poor</h3>
<p>— Zhou Longguang</p>
<p>I think taking the word "poor" as the title of this article, many people will have no way to start, if they are not experienced, it is not relevant; if they have not turned countless somersaults in the word "poor," it is not pleasant to say; I am naturally an expert, but "poor" is the lament of the weak, the psychology in Chinese society is "hating people who are rich and despising people who are poor," even if you say how pitiful and miserable! Others curse you "self-inflicted," and you can't get sympathy at all. It's better not to say it.</p>
<p>I remember that someone in my hometown used to carve his own anthology. The preface to the book described his childhood "poverty" in a few sentences: "Tao Shiheng said that "the walls around are sparse, not sheltering from the wind and rain," and he thought it was "poor" to the extreme, who knows that I only have a small room, and the wall facing east is invaded by heavy rain and has been unable to repair it for many years." Mr. So-and-so's situation is even better than mine. I even thought that I could not get a small room with three walls! My house (actually there is no house long ago, let's borrow it for the time being) was destroyed by fire long ago, and I am still living under someone else's roof, so I am really qualified to be "poor," so poor that I have nothing to say, let's reluctantly borrow the old saying "Last year I was poor, there was no place to stand an awl, this year, there is no awl." to describe it!</p>
<p>However, I am not the first to be sad for "poverty"; Han Tuizhi of the Tang Dynasty has already written "Sending Poverty Away," and Tuizhi cried for poverty because he wanted to be an official. He wrote to the prime minister three times in the capital, saying how urgent it was. However, after examining its contents, it still says: "I am now only in urgent need of the resources for fodder, rice, servants, and rents!" After saying it again and again, it is still because the expenses of feeding horses and hiring servants cannot be paid, which shows that Tuizhi is not really poor, he still has horses and servants.</p>
<p>Three hundred years ago, there was another "poor ghost" Dai Nanshan. He was really poor, almost like me now, but he just lived in the early Qing Dynasty, when the "literary inquisition" was in full swing, and he wanted to write some scolding articles to vent the anger in his chest, but he did not dare to write. He had to write a short essay called "Biography of the Poor Ghost." There is a wonderful passage in it;</p>
<p>"You (referring to the poor ghost) are named after poverty, and your power is enough to make me poor: discussing articles and writing, speaking out is taboo, then poor in words; up and down pits, front falls and back stumbles, bowing and crouching, left support and right, then poor in walking; covered with dust, ridiculed, worried about the public, then poor in辯; what is done is disordered, what is gone is ridiculed, then poor in talent; sound and profit are not enough to move the public, upright and lonely are not enough to harmonize the customs, then poor in friendship; holding useless books, bearing unruly air, taking a empty body, entering the world of厭薄, then poor at home, poor in the country:"</p>
<p>Mr. Dai borrowed this to vent his anger a little. However, it is really enough to suffer when people are so poor that "discussing articles and writing, speaking out is taboo!" I have never been good at making arguments, so I am more comfortable than Mr. Dai, and there is no anger in my chest. When I have nothing to do, I hold a copy of "Taishang Ganying Pian," or "Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra" to read, and I have long forgotten "poverty," but recently I received another letter from my wife, saying: "It's cold! The older children don't have cotton clothes, the younger children are still barefoot, and after the old mother is sick, she wants to drink some soybean soup ..." Alas! Don't read it. I originally forgot "poverty," and my wife wrote "poor words" all over the paper. If others see it, they will ignore me. She doesn't know that the psychology of society is to hate poor people, even if they are "poor," they have to pretend not to be "poor." This is called "sticking out your belly and pretending to be fat." If you don't, you will be called so poor that you have no water to drink.</p>
<h3>Talking about Woodcut (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingsheng</p>
<p>The main thing about woodcut knives is that the chisels have a relatively sharp temper. In the past, China used all slanted edges, which were primitive and not flexible. Therefore, they usually used the wooden-handled woodcut knives sold by Uchiyama Bookstore. Each one and a half yuan is considered medium-quality goods, and it is the best woodcut knife in China. Each set has five or seven heads. Seven heads are sharper, while five heads are suitable for large writing. So I use two sets together. This thing is actually a kind of skin layer knife, which is slightly different from the knives used by the ancients for woodcut. However, everyone engaged in woodcut should have printing equipment, such as high-quality black printing ink from the United States (Germany); ink mixing tools (blade, stone slab) and rubber rollers. Woodblock printing paper from ×× Hall on Wusong Road is the best printing paper, and ordinary Kent copperplate paper from England is also good, but the most troublesome thing is wood. Generally, Cratoxylum formosum is used. This thing is rarely planted in China because its texture is tender and beautiful, so it can neither be used as furniture nor be suitable for burning. There are places to buy it in Shanghai because the seal industry is wide, but the value is doubled. You must also ask an acquaintance carpenter to plane it for you and introduce you to a wood dealer. After the board is changed, you will get two or three hundred pieces of various sizes. It is inconvenient to place them, and it is even more troublesome to move them. In addition, you must also fully study sharpening knives and stones. You must not entrust every knife to a knife sharpener. To get the most out of it, you have to do it yourself (the third issue of Oriental Magazine before the Shanghai war published an article by Mr. Yang ××, a Yangzhou bamboo carver, which can be used as a reference). The old method of carving boards requires applying oil and baking before cutting, which is very wonderful. Beginners should pay attention to avoiding scratching their fingertips when sharpening knives. The most elaborate thing about knives is to sharpen them first, and it is best to make them yourself with British hand-cut steel knives. There are various secret methods for making knives. But beginners don't have to if they draw with Lino.</p>
<p>There are also various secret methods for using knives. In the past, people who walked around with figures mostly regarded them as treasures and refused to teach us (China is the ancestor of woodcut, and the decline of woodcut is also due to this). What I learned in the year or so I spent specializing in woodcut was very pitiful, because most of the people who taught were people without scientific brains, and the teaching was not in line with the teaching method. Woodcut is more difficult than comics, but it gives people more interest than comics. So when we are determined to study it, various difficulties need to be solved or avoided.</p>
<p>At present, young artists each follow the method of taking a hair from the whole ox, and bury themselves in hard work behind closed doors. They are unwilling to publicly discuss technical issues, which is enough to block the future and creation of woodcut. Therefore, I dare to write rashly to attract the attention of woodcut artists, experts, and connoisseurs in the country, and hope that it will have the effect of throwing a brick. There is no doubt that today's woodcut is equal to the comics of a few years ago, and there will be a time when it will develop like the current comics world.</p>
<h3>Scenery of Beiping (One-Act Comedy) (IV)</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: How much are you planning to sell it for?</p>
<p>Liu: Take off one plank, sell for two yuan.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Why take off one yuan?</p>
<p>Liu: We can squeeze a bit wider on that bed!</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Can the price be a little lower?</p>
<p>Liu: That won't do.</p>
<p>Han: Are you still going to buy it? But we can't do it without cash.</p>
<p>Liu: (Shakes hand behind back) Shopkeeper Wang! It's even better if you buy it! I believe you can get two yuan from the other tenants.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: I won't have the money until the day after tomorrow, but...</p>
<p>Han: We need the money to spend now...</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: But I can borrow it from the clerk for you.</p>
<p>(Calls) Clerk! (Clerk enters) Move this plank out too!</p>
<p>Liu: Give us the money first!</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Clerk Zhang (Signals with his eyes), do you have money? Lend me two yuan.</p>
<p>Clerk: I'll go get it for you! (Exits)</p>
<p>Liu: Shopkeeper Wang is truly chivalrous!</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: You're too kind, you're too kind.</p>
<p>Liu: I think the plank doesn't need to be moved out. Shopkeeper Wang, you don't have a place to put it even if you take it out, do you?</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Then wouldn't I be lending you money for nothing?</p>
<p>Liu: But what loan has such high interest? We have to return a plank to you?</p>
<p>(Clerk enters, hands over the money and exits. Shopkeeper takes the money and gives it to Liu.)</p>
<p>Bu: Shopkeeper Wang is the most chivalrous. Anyway, we'll return two new planks to you as soon as we have the money, okay?</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Alright!</p>
<p>Liu: Clerk! (Clerk enters) Move the plank out! (Clerk moves the plank out, the shopkeeper also helps and exits.)</p>
<p>Han: We must overthrow them!</p>
<p>Liu: I've already overthrown them with my intelligence!</p>
<p>Han: Thoroughly overthrowing them requires my fists!</p>
<p>Liu: Old Han! Don't dream, it requires wisdom.</p>
<p>Bu: Friends, don't make a scene! Let's pack up quickly. Whether with wisdom or with fists, in short, love hasn't succeeded yet, the revolution can't strive forward!</p>
<p>(They have probably packed up already. Clerk enters.)</p>
<p>Clerk: Mr. Bu, a young lady has come to see you.</p>
<p>(Liu makes a theatrical gesture)</p>
<p>Bu: Let's go out quickly, let Old Han handle the third step here. Clerk! Please let Miss Zhang in! (Bu and Liu exit)</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Gold Market on the First Day of the Autumn Races Continued to Rise by Two Yuan and Three Jiao in Mediocrity</p>
<p>Frequently Hovering Around the Ninety Yuan Boundary During Half a Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market encountered the first day of the autumn races, and the market was closed later, resulting in a very leisurely market situation for half a day. Although it was slightly weak due to the foreign exchange market and the silver equalization tax in the middle, it finally rose. The overall trend hovered around ninety yuan, which was very mediocre. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US declined, the forward silver market also fell by 1.5 li, foreign exchange rates were flat, and London pure gold rose by one penny. The preliminary trading opened and immediately rose above ninety yuan, but soon after, it was reported downstream. The morning opening was flat, and the central bank's listing was announced, with both the UK and the US flat, the customs gold unit slightly rising by one li, and the standard price of gold rising to 991 yuan and 8 jiao. The market opening was extremely flat, and banks still had a buying appetite, pushing it above ninety yuan. However, there was a high supply. HSBC's listing showed both the UK and the US flat and downstream. At this time, due to the inconsistent appetites of the banks, the gold price also fluctuated, but the market was limited. When the silver equalization tax listed by the central bank was initially reported as unchanged, it once rose above ninety-one yuan. Not long after, a correction message was transmitted, indicating that the equalization tax was actually half a point lower. Large households were not concerned, taking advantage of the high supply, while retail investors had to rush to sell, resulting in a decrease after the increase, falling back to within eighty-eight yuan. Such news did not have a significant impact on the gold market. Many people maintained their positions at low prices, but with limited transactions on the trading floor, the overall trend became stable again, and the sentiment also stabilized. The afternoon was extremely mediocre. Finally, with the overall trend improving, buyers became slightly active, but there was no supply, and it gradually rose above ninety yuan. Short covering also started, and the market became brisk. The market closing closure in the afternoon boosted buying. There were many people observing for half a day, so only over 18,000 shares were traded. The market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 989 yuan and 1 jiao, flat compared to the closing price on Saturday afternoon. The central bank's listing was announced, with both the UK and the US flat, and the customs gold tax rising by one li. The opening was stable, with slight fluctuations. With Fuxing Yongda Fa Yong and others entering, it rose to 90 yuan and 6 jiao. Fuxing Yongheng Yu Yuan Chun and others sold, and the bank Huabi Kensei's recent shilling was four pence. Anticipating that HSBC's listing of the UK and the US would remain unchanged, it fell back to 88 yuan and 3 jiao. Huabi bought December's shilling at 0.0625. Futai Hengfu Yu Hengyu all entered, gradually rising. Citibank bought January's US dollar at 0.25, rising to 90 yuan and 5 jiao. Maijiali HSBC locked in January's shilling at 4 pence. Zhaofeng Changfu Yu Hengyu sold, falling to 88 yuan and 3 jiao. The sentiment remained flat, and the market was stable. Yuqing Yong Sen Chang Yongheng Yu Wanxing Yu Mao Yong and others had a slight buying appetite. The first report came that the silver equalization tax was unchanged, rising to 91 yuan and 3 jiao. Large households were not affected, Fuxing Yong sold down sharply and still declined. Not long after, a correction message came, saying that the tax was actually reduced by half a point. Retail investors rushed to sell, immediately falling to 87 yuan and 6 jiao. However, large households still did not pay attention, and Hengyu took advantage of the remaining strength to buy, resulting in an increase, but there were still fluctuations. As the overall trend improved, Hengyu Yuqing Yu Tianfeng Zhaofeng Changda Fayong Yongfeng Dade Cheng Yuli and others jointly bought, gradually rising above 90 yuan. Due to the market closing closure, retail investors also took the opportunity to cover their positions. Chinese merchants also bought March's shilling at 0.9375, rising to 91 yuan and 6 jiao. Dadecheng Tongfu and others also accepted it. Fuyu Yuli took the opportunity to sell at high prices, falling to 0.08 jiao. Hongxing entered the market, and retail investors strongly supported the price, rising to 1 yuan and 6 jiao. There was some supply at high prices. The afternoon closing was 991 yuan and 4 jiao. The market was stable after closing. The highest price for half a day was 991 yuan and 6 jiao, and the lowest price was 987 yuan and 6 jiao, with a fluctuation of four yuan. It continued to rise by 2 yuan and 3 jiao compared to last week.</p>
<p>The closing price was listed at the central bank's standard price for gold, rising to 991 yuan and 8 jiao. In terms of the closing price, it was slightly squeezed, less than 2 yuan less than last Saturday. The old standard for November, with HSBC's US exchange rate unchanged, remained at 32 yuan and 6875, equivalent to a gold price of 1058 yuan. Account registration for this month was 991 yuan, December was 991 yuan, and the replenishment in the morning was 991 yuan. The price of pure gold was estimated at 999 yuan and 1 jiao. The spot market was short of short positions, and the water step fell. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang sold over a thousand taels to Yingfeng Heng, and Da Feng Heng several hundred taels, according to an additional 11 yuan. The swap was to be advanced by the short side. Although the long side was willing to advance, there was a lack of short positions. Yingfeng Heng Xingsheng Dada offset 140 shares, and the discount price was 1 yuan and 2 jiao, which may be due to the interest rate for over 20 days. The remaining November shares were reduced to 735, with a total of 11 long parties and 5 short parties.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was leisurely. In summary, Dadecheng Futai Heng Ding Zhaofeng Changfu Yu Fuan Dachang Xiang Shen Kang, etc. were on the buying side, while Tongtaichang Yongli Tongfu Hengyu Yu Yuanchun Hengchang Yong, etc. were on the selling side. Dafayong Yongfeng Yuli Fuyu advanced first and then exited. Hengyu Yuqing Yongheng Tai exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing did about 700 transactions, with a slight profit. Shunli did over 300, with a slight loss. The Guang gang Shengda Hengxing were all quiet. The total number of transactions in half a day was only 18,725. The total number of December chips was 29,169, with a total of 56 long positions and 59 short positions.</p>
<p>Public orders were collected and settled on the same day. Yingfeng Heng released 140 orders, and the collected orders included Yuan Yi 63, Yifeng Yong Tianfeng 21 each, Daxing Yong 14, and Fuyu Dadecheng Qian Changxiang 7 each. The closing price was 991 yuan.</p>
<p>The British and American Silver Markets Reported a Contraction, Foreign Exchange Rates Were Apparently Flat but Tight</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, London's silver prices for both near and far terms decreased by 1.25, US silver fell by 0.25, forward silver prices contracted by 1.5 li, London raw gold rose by 1 penny, British exchange rate against the US contracted by 0.0375, the US against the British remained unchanged, the British against the French decreased by 0.15 pounds, and the US against the French did not change. The morning opening of the exchange market showed a recent selling price, with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling and 4 pence, and the US exchange rate at 33 yuan and 25 fen, which was tighter by 0.0625 compared to last Saturday for both the British and American rates. After the opening, the central bank's listing showed the British and American rates as flat, and the customs gold increased by 1 li. The process was generally flat, and banks still had a buying appetite. HSBC's listing showed the British and American rates as flat, and banks slightly tightened the shilling. After entering the market, banks traded with each other, but there were not many transactions, and the process was very mediocre. The announcement of the silver equalization tax made it difficult for the exchange market to change. Finally, Chinese merchants had a buying appetite again, and the underlying trend slightly tightened. By the time of the afternoon closing, the recent selling price was the British exchange rate at 1 shilling and 4 pence, and the US exchange rate at 33 yuan and 25 fen, which was tighter by 0.0625 compared to last Saturday for both the British and American rates. The buying appetite of Chinese merchants and banks varied, and Chinese merchants roughly bought 120,000 pounds of shillings and over 50,000 yuan of US dollars. There were not many transactions in half a day. The half-day transaction record is as follows:</p>
<p>The British exchange rate opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence, Huabi bought December's 0.0625, Citibank sold January's 0.04 to Huabi, Macalister · HSBC blocked the same month at the same price, Macalister blocked March's shilling at 3 pence 0.9375, Mitsui sold January's shilling at 4 pence to Citibank, Zhengjin · Korean blocked the same month at the same price, Overseas Chinese sold the same price and 0.0625 swaps to Jincheng for November, Huayi sold February's 0.04 to Youli, Huabi blocked January's at the same price, Macalister blocked March's shilling at 3 pence 0.9375, the closing price in the afternoon was the recent selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence, the forward price was 3 pence 0.9375, and the purchase price was increased by 0.0625.</p>

<p>Various Industries Need Funds in a Leisurely Manner, Foreign Collateral is Unlikely to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, although it was Monday, and also the 5th day of the month, according to the previous prosperous situation, the market atmosphere should have been quite strong. However, due to the current sluggish market and the difficulty for various commercial sectors to need funds, the procedures and operations of the financial sector were quite leisurely and not vigorous. The foreign collateral head cushion was quite abundant, so it was difficult to expect foreign collateral to rise. Yesterday, the morning and afternoon markets were still at 1 jiao and 2 fen, which was slightly better by 2 fen than the previous day, Sunday, but the same as the end of last week, which shows the sluggishness of the market atmosphere. The initial increase for loan extensions was 2 fen, but it was still a free extension afterwards. The transaction volume for collateral tickets was over 2.8 million in the morning market, and over 500,000 for new transactions. The transaction volume in the afternoon market was over 300,000, and the transaction volume in the small general meeting was over 400,000. The transaction volume for foreign collateral loans was over 800,000 for withdrawals and over 1.5 million for new loans. The banknote withdrawal was over 900,000, and the issuance was over 1.4 million. The customer traffic flow was a total of over 500,000. The bank's collection and settlement, foreign banks' collection and settlement of bills was around 3 million, the collection and settlement of various goods, foreign exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous items was 5.2-3 million, foreign exchange settlements were over 800,000, special exchange items were over 500,000, and warehouse exits were 400,000. Chinese banks' collection and settlement of bills was over 3.2 million, the collection and settlement of various goods, foreign exchange taxes, mortgages, and miscellaneous items was over 6 million, special exchange items were over 700,000, foreign exchange price items were over 800,000, and warehouse exits were 800,000.

In addition, the total amount of exchange at the city's Clearing House on the 5th was 12,098,215.97 silver dollars, including 6,217,648.72 silver dollars in cash and 5,880,567.25 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<p>The Price Difference Between Single and Double Mill Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the morning market price for Jiangnan small mill dollars was 830 yuan and 0.5 jiao, and the afternoon market price was changed by 2.5 yuan, to 828 yuan. The result was worse by 2-3 yuan. The transaction volume in the morning market was 11,000 jiao, and in the afternoon market was 3,000 jiao. The morning market price for Guangdong small mill dollars was 749 yuan and 5 jiao, and the afternoon market price was 750 yuan, which was 1.5 yuan better than the previous day. The transaction volume in the morning and afternoon markets was 140,000 jiao, and in the afternoon market was 80,000 jiao. Copper coins remained the same, still at 320,000 characters, with a transaction volume of 35,100 strings, equivalent to 11,000 yuan in mill dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Public Bond Market Has Many Variations, the '96' Suddenly Rose by Over One Yuan</p>
<p>However, the Closing Prices Showed an Inverted Structure for Near and Far Terms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange suddenly changed due to prolonged fluctuations. Certain major banks in the financial sector had purchases in every session. Northern and Ningbo merchants were particularly interested in the '96' bond. The news behind this is different from previous rumors of reorganization, and there is certainly a different effect. Observing the vigorous buying by various merchants, it does not seem to be aimless. On the surface, there may be a connection to the surge in the '66' bond, raising it along with it. Moreover, its price is low, making it easy to acquire. Therefore, the rise of the '96' bond this time is different from the previous few times, and there may still be a possibility of continued increase. However, it is difficult to say. The reorganization of the '96' bond is not an easy task. Even if reorganized, it would only benefit a few. Therefore, only insiders know what the future holds. Yesterday's proceedings: At the opening in the morning, the '66' bond did not show weakness due to the large increase in the past day, and even surged by half a yuan again. This shows that there are many shorts in this public bond, but the actual cash is limited. In the second session, it continued to rise by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, which was still stable. At this time, there were rumors in the market that the '96' bond was expected to rise. Therefore, at the opening in the afternoon, the '96' bond surged by 0.45 yuan, and the '66' bond also continued to improve by 0.35 yuan. At the closing, the '66' bond even exceeded the 70 yuan mark, and the '96' bond rose by another 0.45 yuan. However, during the rise, many longs in the trading floor grabbed hats, fearing a repeat of the previous failure, and closed their positions one after another. Therefore, this month's increase was 0.45 yuan, but the next month was only 0.05 yuan, creating an inverted structure. In terms of market price results, it rose by several jiao to over one yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 20 million yuan. The rising and falling situation is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Tax Increase Favors Long Positions, Marked Yarn Continues to Show a Strong State</p>
<p>The Marked Yarn Market Continues to be Strong, with a Stable Situation. Overseas Cotton Industry Conditions are Calm, and Current Yarn Sales are Smooth. Guangdong and Inland Merchants Have Strong Buying Appetites. Buyers Discuss that the Inventory of Various Factories Has Been Significantly Reduced Compared to Before. As a Result, New Users are Hindered, and the Matter of Increasing the Unified Tax Has Not Been Decided, Causing People to Feel Uncertain.</p>
<p>The Golden Rooster Also Improved by 0.8 to 0.9 jiao. At the Opening of the Marked Yarn Market, Due to a Lack of Sellers in the Market and a General Belief that the Increase in the Unified Tax Favored Long Positions, the Market Atmosphere was Firm. Each Month Rose by 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 jiao. In the Afternoon, it was Heard that the Current Yarn Sales were Good, Still at 1,500 Bales, and the Selling Price Was Increasing. Therefore, Sellers Were Lacking, and Each Month Rose by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 jiao. The Full-Day Transaction Statistics Reached 36,000 Bales. Da Fu Sold 750 Bales, Tong Ji 600 Bales, Suilong 1,000 Bales, Jinchang 400 Bales, Zhenda 400 Bales, Taixing 600 Bales, Jun Chang 900 Bales, Hengde 600 Bales, Yichang 600 Bales, Run Kang 750 Bales, Dachang 800 Bales, Yuanda 1,050 Bales, Yuande 500 Bales, and Xincheng 500 Bales.

The Highest and Lowest Prices and Closing Prices for One Day are as Follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Reached 1,500 Bales. The Current Yarn Sales are Still Good. The Statistics for Each Merchant's Purchases Throughout the Day Reached 1,500 Bales. The Market Price Rose by 0.5 jiao to About 1 Yuan. The Purchase Amount of Each Merchant is as Follows:</p>
<p>The Cotton Market's Resistance to Shorts is Still Strong</p>
<p>The Cotton Market is Trending Stronger Because the Sources from Various Routes are Not Prosperous, and the Price in Hankou's News Report is Rising, Causing Activities on Many Routes. The Gold Price is Firm and Stable, but Foreign Cotton is Weak, and the Yarn Market is Firm, Raising People's Spirits Slightly. There are More People Offsetting Scattered Shorts, but Current Cotton Consumption is Not Smooth.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Improved by 0.25 jiao. At the Opening of the Marked Cotton Market, the Market Atmosphere was Very Tight. The Buying Appetite in the Market was Stronger Because Scattered Shorts Covered Their Positions, Leading to Firmness. Later, with Large Households Selling, it Slightly Declined. The Result Was That Each Month Rose by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 jiao. In the Afternoon, Those Who Made Profits Closed Their Positions, Causing the Market to Loosen Slightly. Each Month Fell Back by 0.05 to 0.1-0.2 jiao. The Full-Day Transaction Statistics Reached 67,700 Dan. Tong Ji Sold 1,700 Dan, Dafeng 2,300 Dan, Yuanda 3,400 Dan, Taixing 1,100 Dan, Gengfeng 4,800 Dan, Xie Sheng 1,300 Dan, Xincheng 4,100 Dan, De Ji 1,100 Dan, Yuanxingchang 1,100 Dan, Changhe 2,400 Dan, Changfeng 2,300 Dan, and Dachang 1,100 Dan. Yuda Bought 1,700 Dan, Shenchang 4,100 Dan, Shen Ji 3,700 Dan, Changfeng 4,200 Dan, Run Kang 10,200 Dan, Tonghe 2,500 Dan, and Yifeng 1,100 Dan. The Lowest Price and Closing Price for One Day are Listed Below:</p>
<p>The Current Cotton Factory's Demand is Not Strong. The Current Cotton Sales are Still Stagnant, and the Factory's Demand is Not Strong. The Source is Estimated at 266 Bales of Yao Cotton and 750 Bales of Tong Cotton.</p>
<p>The Weather in the Indian Cotton Region is Unfavorable</p>
<p>Since the Cotton Market Stopped Trading Last Week, It Has Been Rising Steadily Due to Unfavorable Weather Reports in the Cotton Region. Although the Cotton Region Needs Rain, the Recent Heavy Rains May Damage the Quality of Cotton. The Transaction Volume During the Week Was Less Than Average. Generally, Longs Sold at High Prices, and Transportation Merchants Bought at Falling Prices. The Spot Market Situation Was Not Distinctive, and Factories Had a Slight Intention to Enter. The Far East Was Quite Active. The Statistics for Last Week are Attached Below (Unit: Thousand Bales):</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The Rice Price Stepped Up, and the Medium-Term Flour and Wheat Showed a Continuous Rising Trend</p>
<p>After the Opening of the Flour Market in the Morning, the Market for Each Month Presented a Phenomenon of Initial Flatness Followed by a Rise. The Quoted Prices for Foreign Wheat in Chicago and Canada Fell Slightly by 0.1-0.2 Jiao. Therefore, at the Opening Price, the Market Atmosphere Was Fatigue and Stagnation, and the Difference from the Closing Price of the Previous Week Was Almost Nil. Then, with the Tianjin Gang Having Some Forward Business and the Recent Rise in Rice Prices, People's Hearts Were Good, and Bidding Prices Stepped Up. Until the Opening of the Market in the Afternoon, the Market Atmosphere Continued to be Brisk and Profitable. The Factories Only Heard That Fuxin Slightly Produced, and the Rest Did Not Move. Also, Due to the Rice Price, the Mainland Gang Quite Absorbed. Therefore, Although the Transaction Was Not Very Smooth, the Market Had a Continuing Rising and Increasing Trend. As a Result, Each Month from This Month to January Rose by 0.0325, February Improved by 0.035, March Rose by 0.0375, and April Rose by 0.04.</p>
<p>After the Opening of the Wheat Market in the Morning, the Market for Each Month Presented a Phenomenon of Stability. Although the Quoted Prices for Foreign Wheat in Chicago and Canada Were Both Slightly Down by 0.1-0.2 Jiao, There Was No Activity in the Foreign Company's Quoted Prices for Current Foreign Wheat. Therefore, There Were Very Few Sellers in the Market, and Buyers Were Quite Eager. The Bidding Price for Each Month Improved by 0.02-0.03. Until the Opening Price in the Afternoon, with the Flour Market's Recovery and the Rice Price's Thriving Prosperity, Sellers Became Scarcer, and the Rise Was More Spectacular. This Kind of Situation Will Inevitably Lead to Easy Rise and Difficult Fall in the Market Without Foreign Assistance. As a Result, This Month Rose by 0.06, December Rose by 0.08, January Rose by 0.1, February Rose by 0.09, and March Opened at 4.14 Yuan, Which is Estimated to Be 0.15 Yuan Better Than When It Initially Opened at the Beginning of the Previous Week. Because the Factory's Stomach Stopped, the Current Wheat Was Rejected and Not Opened.</p>
<p>The Australian Pest Disaster is More Severe, and the Overseas Market is Thriving. Therefore, Chicago's Miscellaneous Grains Opened Tightly and Stably. However, in General, There is Some Fear of Competition from the Import of Overseas Miscellaneous Grains. In Addition, the Closing Price of the Wheat Market at the End of the Week Fell.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Traded 6,000 Tons</p>
<p>Guest Rice Traded Nearly 7,000 Bags, and the Opening Price Rose by More Than Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The Wuxi Gang Also Procured Guest Indica Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Guest Indica Market Rose Unanimously, and the Transaction Was Particularly Lively. The Opening Price of Foreign Wheat in the Futures Market in the Morning Was Still Low, but Later It Was Coped With by the Mainland and Local Streets, and the Price Was Also Spurred to Rise by 0.15 Jiao. Yongda Company Threw Out 400 Tons of March Unified Market, and the Price Was Only 5.2 Yuan. Later, Dafu Produced 1,000 Tons of March, and the Price Had Reached 5.32 Yuan. Heyi Produced 1,200 Tons, and the Price Rose Another 0.02, to 5.34 Yuan. Fujia Produced 1,000 Tons, Drawing 5.33 Yuan. Dafu Produced 1,000 Tons in February, and the Price Was 5.28 Yuan. Yongda Company Immediately Loaded 400 Tons, and the Price Was 5.15 Yuan. Heyi's November-December Term 500 Tons, and the Price Was 5.18 Yuan. Other Round-Trips and Closings Also Had 500-600 Tons, and the Price Was Similar. In Total, the Transaction Reached More Than 6,000 Tons. Current Foreign Rice Opened at 5,000 Bags in Xiguan, and the Price of Special High-Quality Goods Reached 11.6 Yuan, and the Price of General Market Goods Also Reached 11.3 Yuan, Which Was 0.4-0.5 Jiao Higher Than the End of Last Week.</p>
<p>There Was Not Much Guest Indica Yesterday, and the Digestion Was Very Active, Especially Because the Mainland Gang Was the Most Greedy. The Wuxi Gang Competed with the Local Street, and the Price Spurred to Rise by More Than Half a Yuan. The Whole City Opened 6,856 Bags.</p>
<p>Thick New Japonica Rice Rose Sharply by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the Sources of Various Gangs Turned More, Counting Over 40 Items (a Total of Over 6,000 Shi of Goods). After Its Market Situation Turned Around the Day Before Yesterday, Yesterday's Opening Had a Tightening Trend. When There Was a Sudden Torrential Rain in the Back Market, People's Hearts Had a Major Change. The Sellers' Shouts Suddenly Became Tense, and the Situation Was Chaotic. Because the Local Street's Sales Were Active, Although the Guest Gang Only Packed About 200 Bags in Qingdao, the Prices of Various Late Rice Grains Continued to Rise by 0.2-0.3 Jiao. If Wild White Rice and Other Thick New Japonica Rice Experienced a Turn for the Better, It is Estimated That the Market Rose Sharply by Half a Yuan. Du Yangjian and Other Flowers and Yinbian Yuan All Rose by 0.2-0.3 Chi.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 13-14 Items of Goods Arrived at the Port Under the River. The River Storage is Increasingly Sparse, Only 70-80 Ships. The Market Sales of New Japonica Rice, Broken Japonica Rice, Thin Rice, New Chen White Yuan, and Yin Yuan Are Not Very Tight. New Yang Du Jian and New Chen Bu Ke Jian Are Slightly Digested. The Market is Shaped by New Japonica Rice High-Quality Goods Prices Rising by 0.2-0.3 Jiao, and Middle and Second-Quality Prices Rising by 0.3-0.4 Jiao. In Addition to Broken Japonica Rice and New Yang Jian Rising by 0.2 Jiao, the Prices of New Chen White Yuan, Yin Yuan, New Du Jian, New Chen Bu Ke Jian, and Thin Rice Also Rose by 0.2-0.3 Jiao.</p>
<p>Soybean Prices Rose by More Than 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's Soybean Market Price Was More Than 1 Jiao Higher Than Last Weekend. The Reasons Were: (1) The Wuxi Rice-Producing Area Came to This City to Procure Large Quantities of Foreign Guest Indica Rice, (2) The Production Price Rose Daily, (3) The Output Route Was Lively. Therefore, the Market Atmosphere Spurred a Rise in the Unified Market Transaction of 7,000-8,000 Bags of Cartwheel Beans. The Sales Outlets Pushed the Majority of the Mainland and Local Streets, Followed by Fuzhou and Quanzhou. The Factories Procured Two Trucks of Chen Dou from Yingzhou, and the Price Was 3 Yuan. The Source of Pudong Du Beans Was Still Sparse, and the Market Price Also Rebounded. Yesterday's Opening Was 4.98-5 Yuan, and Only Over 50 Bags Were Traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Local Refined White Sugar Fell Another 0.1 Jiao</p>
<p>Japanese Sugar's Secret Inflow and Outflow Were Quite Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday's Sugar Market's Trend Was Flat, With the Customs Gold Not Fluctuating Much. The Guild's Marked Price for 24 Coarse Sand White Was 18.75 Yuan for Ordinary Spot Goods and 18.85 Yuan for Local Warehouse Goods, Both Lacked Change. The Transfer Cargo Was Called at a Rise but Lacked Acceptance, Still Marked at 5.42 Yuan. Dutch Red Had No Rise or Fall, and There Was No Transaction. The Local Factory's Refined White Sugar Continued to Decline, and Zhenyu No. 1 Fell Another 0.1 Jiao, to 16.9 Yuan. Zhenji No. 1 Was Called at 17.1 Yuan, but It Did Not Succeed. It Was Found That the Local Refined White Sugar Was Long-Tired and Short-Brisk, Which Was Entirely Due to the Activity of Inferior Goods. Although the Guild's Delivery See Was Not Public Recently, the Secret Inflow and Outflow Were Quite Lively. The Sugar Industry Used to Have the Reputation of Sugar Sons, but Now With Such Actions, the Guild Received a Warning Letter From a Certain Party Yesterday, It Is Unknown Whether Those Engaged in This Will Also Have a Movement in the Middle.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>The Price of Black Fungus Rose Sharply Without End</p>
<p>Bo Red Dates Rose by 0.3 Jiao</p>
<p>Lately, in the Hankou Market, Black Fungus Has Been Rising Step by Step Because the Jiangxi Gang Procured According to the Market Regardless of the Height of the Price. Yesterday, the Price of the Xingan Fungus Rose Another 3 Yuan, to 91.8 Yuan, and the Quoted Price in Shanghai Was Close to 107 Yuan. Moreover, the Price of the Kuier Was Even Tighter, Soaring to 128 Yuan, and the Quoted Price in Shanghai Was Required to Be Over 140 Yuan. It Seems That There is Still a Continuing Tightening Intention. The Market Disc Here, Dingsheng Aviation Brand Small Package Fungus Is Called at 105 Yuan, and the Trend is Also Firm and Tight. The Bozhou Red Dates Had Decreased to 7.2 Jiao Before Because of the Large Arrival Relationship. The Trading Side, With the Price Reaching the Low Plate, Had a Good Eating Stomach. Yesterday, the Opening Price Had Rebounded by 0.3 Jiao, Opening at 7.5 Yuan, and 200-300 Packages Were Traded, and the Selling Price Followed the Rise.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>Women Love Wearing Camel Hair Overcoats</p>
<p>Recently, women's overcoat fabrics have been selling very well. Overcoats priced around 20 yuan are particularly popular. As a result, ordinary women's overcoat fabrics priced around 4 yuan are also selling in increasingly large quantities. Camel color is very fashionable this year. Ordinary flannel is being sold for around 5 yuan. Silk-dotted women's overcoat fabric is priced at 5 yuan and 65 cents. Herringbone wave patterns are priced at 4 yuan and 50 cents. Various diagonal patterns are all priced at a net 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Both Green and Black Tea Transactions Are Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port city turned quiet. European firms had sent out a large number of telegrams last week, but have not yet received replies, and are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach. Only companies such as Xiehe, Fushi, and Tianxiang bought a total of more than 400 boxes of Chun Mee and Needle-Shaped Mee green teas. The selling price did not increase or decrease compared to before. Transactions of pearl tea, Gongxi tea, as well as Qimen and Hubei black teas, have all become scarce, and the market situation is gradually declining.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Pig Lead Transactions Are Uniquely Prosperous on This Street</p>
<p>Pig lead transactions have been quiet for a long time, but recently there have been signs of a turnaround. This is because paint companies and yellow lead factories on this street have purchased large quantities, and printing houses and manufacturing plants have also bought some for decoration. Therefore, the market trading is still quite lively. However, export business has not been seen to start up. The market price is 15 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and there are asking prices as high as 15 yuan and 25 cents. Although it rained yesterday, it is estimated that 700 to 800 bars were still sold. It is said that most of the wholesalers are hardware stores in the French Concession, while only a small amount was sold by hardware stores on North Suzhou Road.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Is Self-deprecation Really a Virtue?</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>The other day I read Mr. "Long's" article "Self-confidence," and I couldn't help but feel that the "art of dealing with the world" is not easy.</p>
<p>"Self-confidence" is "arrogance," and "arrogance" is indeed not good, but the opposite of self-confidence is "self-deprecation." But is "self-deprecation" really a virtue? I don't dare say that, because historically, people who are too "self-deprecating" have had many problems: "Wang Mang was humble and courteous to scholars," "Wang Anshi repeatedly declined appointments." Such artificial people ended up causing many big problems.</p>
<p>For example, in the victory at Fei River, "Xie An received the express letter, and was still playing Weiqi with guests. He put the letter on the bed and showed no sign of joy, and continued to play Weiqi as before. The guest asked him about it, and he slowly replied, 'The children have already defeated the bandits.' After finishing the game, he returned home, and when he crossed the threshold, he unknowingly broke the heel of his shoe." Although Xie An did not cause any major chaos, his deliberately calm, "not too self-confident" appearance was still a bit inhuman. Therefore, the historian, in describing his pretentious attitude, used the four characters "broke the heel of his shoe" to fully express Xie An's anxious and ecstatic expression. I think "self-confident" people are still better than "self-deprecating" people. It is truly "a hypocrite is not as good as a true villain."</p>
<p>The essays in the world, those from Zhejiang are the best; the essays from Zhejiang, those from Shaoxing are the best; the essays from Shaoxing, those from my elder brother are the best; my elder brother's essays still need my younger brother to revise them. This is a wonderful saying passed down among the people of Shaoxing.</p>
<p>Another example is "Deng Ai stuttered, saying 'Ai, Ai.' King Wen of Jin joked with him, saying, 'How many Ais is 'Ai, Ai'?' He replied, 'Phoenix, phoenix, is still one phoenix.'" Another example is "Lu Yun and Xun Minghe had never met before. Once they were sitting with Zhang Hua, Hua said, 'Today we meet, let's not talk common talk.' Yun then raised his hand and said, 'Lu Tulong from the clouds.' Xun said, 'Xun Minghe under the sun.'" The two characters "raised his hand" clearly show Lu Shilon's arrogant appearance, just like the Shanghainese 'bai xiang ren' (loungers), who often pat their chests and give a thumbs up, the same expression.</p>
<p>I really believe in people who are so straightforward and impolite, because whatever is in their stomachs is what they say, and what they show is what they are. But from the perspective of onlookers, it always feels like they are boasting too much, which is a bit jarring, and ultimately does not conform to the "art of dealing with the world." If such "self-deprecation" is not good, and "self-confidence" is also not good, what kind of attitude is considered neither arrogant nor servile, and fully embodies the Doctrine of the Mean?</p>
<p>Li Linfu of the Tang Dynasty was known as "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted." This is the same as what we commonly say, "sugar comes out of the mouth, a knife comes out of the heart." To extend it a bit, it means "inconsistent words and deeds," a face full of "benevolence and morality," a stomach full of "male thieves and female prostitutes," saying all sorts of flowery words but doing</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>terrible things. Is this what is called the Doctrine of the Mean?</p>
<p>No, this is definitely not the Doctrine of the Mean. The so-called Doctrine of the Mean is "unobstructed in all directions" and "harmonious on all sides." If people say it's good, I say it's not bad; if people say it's not effective, I say it's really unreasonable. The so-called "harmonizing with their light and assimilating to their dust" can perhaps be called the Doctrine of the Mean. Therefore, I thought of two standard figures of the Doctrine of the Mean and wrote them below as a conclusion:</p>
<p>When the capital city of the Han Dynasty asked Marquis Xu Bo of Pingen to enter his residence, the prime minister and the generals of the Two Thousand Dan class all offered congratulations. The wine was sweet and the music was playing. Zhang Changqing, the Lesser Official of Changxin, stood up and danced, imitating a monkey fighting with a dog. Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Han Nizhou of the Song Dynasty once toured the South Garden with his family and guests. Passing by a mountain village, he looked at the bamboo fences and thatched huts and said, "This is truly the atmosphere of the countryside, but it lacks the crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs." Suddenly, they heard a dog barking in the bushes. Upon closer inspection, it was Shi Duo. Nizhou laughed loudly.</p>
<h3>Five Hundred People Poisoned to Death in Tangshan</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, Lin Zexu's memorial regarding the prohibition of opium smoking stated: "If prohibition is not enforced, in a few decades, not only will there be no wealth to collect, but also no soldiers to train." He spoke very clearly about the harm that "Afurong" (opium) causes to the people. Its impact on the country and the nation lies not only in the passive waste of time and abandonment of work, but also in the progressive weakening of the people and the country. The warning "opium will destroy the country" is, I think, still applicable to the current situation. As the saying goes, "A chopper and a pipe can chop through ten thousand acres of fields." Some have been ruined and bankrupted by getting involved in opium, and some have become seriously ill and died from the addiction. As for the social evils that arise under the compulsion of opium addiction, they are even more difficult to count.</p>
<p>But our nation always has this incurable bad habit. Knowing the harm, we still become addicted to it, especially many famous officials and wealthy merchants, whose love for "Yun Gao" (opium paste) seems to have become like "no poison, no true man." As a result, those above influence those below, to the point that countless peddlers and coolies are sent to their deaths next to the "Tai Gu Luo Luo" (a type of opium). The Japanese imperialists have taken advantage of this weakness to carry out their grand plan to destroy China. The "New Manchuria's" vigorous implementation of the "three poisons policy" is obvious. Let's look at the facts that have come with the opening of the Shenyang-Pingjin railway. A telegram from Tianjin a few days ago stated: "Japanese companies are rampant in Tangshan, and the scourge of poison is spreading. The number of people harmed to death is truly alarming. The Public Security Bureau reported that from January to September of this year, 283 people died on the streets, of which 170 died from poisoning; 410 people died on the streets in the mining area, of which 330 died from poisoning."</p>
<p>Remember! In Tangshan alone, in September, as many as 500 people "died" from poisoning. If we count the number of people in various war zones (not to mention the Northeast) within two or three years, as well as those who did not "die on the streets" but "died peacefully in their beds," the "alarming" number can be imagined. Military vehicles carrying "special goods" come in and out of various passes of the Great Wall, and Korean drug dealers are rampant, all of which should arouse our vigilance. Just imagine, as our people swallow clouds and spit fog, foreign money is sent into the enemy's pockets in batches. After consuming it, their spirits are weakened, their will is depressed, and their children and grandchildren will not "resist the Manchus and fight against Japan." When their last breath is exhausted, people die and the land returns to others. What kind of sighs will we have?</p>
<p>When we see this bloody record, we really do not have the leisurely mood of the Guangzhou worthies to save the country, save the people, and save the race (which implicitly refers to playing mahjong, smoking opium, and visiting brothels). However, when various places in the South are executing drug dealers, how will we comfort the wronged souls of the countless people who have died from poisoning?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Scenes from the Village</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>The weather in June, the poisonous sun burning like a brazier, the sky is always a large expanse of blue, clear, without a single cloud, and even less of any sign of rain. Rain has become as precious as pearls. Hoping for rain is like hoping for pearls to fall from the sky. The sun shines on the river, and the river dries up. It shines on the fields, and the green rice seedlings turn into reddish-brown withered grass, wilting and falling one after another. That tenuous hope that it holds is also wilting away. But later, even the water in the rivers and ponds dried up. And the sky is always a large expanse of blue, still without a trace of rain, that's how all the long days have been.</p>
<p>The only hope has also been declared shattered. Then, following the harsh climate, people's personalities have become very bad.</p>
<p>No one thinks of their own fields anymore, and going to the fields only results in unwarranted scolding. They scold others, and they scold themselves. And everyone is wearing a stern face, as if they have a bellyful of anger. All day long, I'm looking for someone to argue with. If I meet someone who's not right, they'll grab each other by the testicles and beat each other up. It's as if everyone sees everyone else as an enemy.</p>
<p>It's as if all the people have gone mad. The men are out causing trouble all day long, and when they happen to have money, they don't settle down their women at home like they usually do. Instead, they go out drinking recklessly, and when they're drunk, they stagger home. Then the women cry with mournful faces and grumble about something.</p>
<p>—You go out looking for pleasure by yourself, and you don't care about the family. We won't have any rice to cook tomorrow, you know that? You heartless bastard.</p>
<p>—Your mother's, go marry someone else, you black crow, I won't care about you no matter what.</p>
<p>That's how they answer every time, with red eyes. Every man answers his woman like that. In a fit of anger, they sometimes drag the woman over and beat her up. They use this to vent their anger. Then the woman cries loudly. In the old days, men would listen to every word their women said, and do whatever they asked. But now it's different. Men get angry as soon as they hear a woman open her mouth. Every day is just endless arguing, you blame him, he blames you. The home is no longer a home. The women no longer see the men as their husbands, and the men no longer see the women as their wives. Everything is like a karmic debt.</p>
<p>Even the women's tempers have become as fierce as the men's. All day long, they keep cursing and scolding the men, beating the sons. With a sullen face, they don't think about anything, and they don't do what they should do. It's as if they've lost their senses. They sit blankly in the doorway, staring at the sky all day long, as if they're trying to find something there. But the sky is always the same, always a large expanse of blue, clear, without a single cloud. How can there be rain? The sky is really blind! They curse like that, and then sigh heavily. Many people are sighing the same way, looking at the unchanging sky.</p>
<p>What are we going to eat? After a few days, the village can't stay in any way. We have to think of something else. So the men leave home one by one, leaving the village and going to other places. Then the women have to leave. The village suddenly takes on an unusually desolate loneliness, but the sky is still unchanging.</p>
<h3>"Wow! Mom! The Evening News is ...?"</h3>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>Walking</p>
<p>Mentioning the old capital will remind people of the saying, "Three feet of dust without wind, mud everywhere with rain," which describes the old capital. Some time ago, I still suspected that these words came from a poet's exaggeration, like the absurdity of "three thousand feet of white hair." But after setting foot on that land, I realized that it was actually the truth.</p>
<p>Although the old capital is also a large city with more than a million people, and it has been the home of emperors for hundreds of years, the roads there are enough to make people angry. Asphalt roads, except for a few bustling streets, are non-existent. Even pebble roads that look the part are rarely seen. Loose dirt roads probably can't withstand the donkey carts, horse carts, rickshaws... constantly rolling over them, so the middle of many roads is actually sunken one or two feet deep. When it rains, puddles of dirty mud accumulate, and if pedestrians are unwilling to sacrifice their shoes and socks to wade through the mud, they have to stop and watch the sky anxiously.</p>
<p>The soil quality in this place is also quite special. No matter how wet the mud is, after a day or two of good sun, it gradually becomes dry. At this time, even if there is no wind, the vehicles coming and going will often fill the sky with a gray-white dust. Walking in the dust, if your eyes and nose are not particularly good, you can't guarantee that you won't have problems.</p>
<p>Public toilets are everywhere, and signs that say "Pay attention to hygiene" are hung everywhere, but children under the age of eleven or twelve seem to have been granted a special privilege to urinate anywhere. And donkeys, horses, dogs... these animals are particularly numerous, and they defecate</p>
<h3>Southeast Northwest</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>The newspaper reports that a certain Wang Zhisheng from Hubei specializes in stealing felt hats in cinemas such as the Grand Shanghai and Nanjing. He also buys a ticket to enter the venue first. When the movie is halfway through, he lifts his foot to hook the hat from the seat in front of him, and then walks away. People in this line of work call it "foot fishing," which is vastly different in artistry from "tossing the top palace," which involves forcibly taking a hat from the head of a passenger on a tram.</p>
<p>If we pay a little attention to social news, this kind of intriguing theft is truly endless. No matter how quickly the cases are solved and how severely the perpetrators are sentenced, the successors who do business without capital continue to increase.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is indeed that these idlers are unwilling to learn a trade. On the other hand, it is also a real situation that there is no work to do. When the belt can no longer be tightened, they take the risk. Engaging in "foot fishing" is still a relatively law-abiding type, aren't there more news about murder and robbery every day?</p>
<p>These are things we hear and see, and I'm afraid things are even worse in the dark. Although Wang Zhisheng has been sentenced to six months, perhaps those up-and-coming "Jiang Taigong" will have new inventions?</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>where people walk. If you pay attention, you can find human feces and horse manure everywhere in every alley. These things, of course, won't cause any problems if you're walking during the day, but they're a bit inappropriate at night, because the road surface is so rough and the street lights are so dim—many alleys don't even have street lights—if you move your foot, you can't even be sure if you can stand firmly, so how can you pay attention to so many things? Therefore, it is very common to bring back a foot of smelly feces when you stroll around the streets at night.</p>
<p>"Walking," in the minds of many people, the old capital that is often yearned for, has so many hardships!</p>

<h3>Organizing a Northwest Development Association</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>A few days ago, this column published an article by Mr. Yu Junjie, in which Mr. Yu initiated the organization of a Northwest Inspection Group to conduct an on-site inspection of the Northwest first. I agree with this method very much and hope that he will organize it quickly. Now I have a few opinions regarding the organization and implementation, which I am writing out for the reference of all comrades.</p>
<p>(1) Developing the Northwest is a very vast undertaking. If we, as individuals or just two or three comrades, want to set off to the remote Northwest to do development work, it is very dangerous. Not only will manpower and finances be difficult, but also the unfamiliarity with people and places will make it difficult to achieve success. Therefore, we must solicit the support of a large number of comrades and first organize a Northwest Development Association.</p>
<p>(2) The purpose and organizational methods of this association—1. The purpose of the association is to promote the development of the Northwest and to assist comrades who are developing the Northwest as the main body; 2. Seek legal initiators to convene an initiators' meeting to preside over all affairs; 3. The solicitation of members, the raising of funds, etc., will all be decided after the initiators' meeting.</p>
<p>(3) The methods of developing the Northwest—Many armies form an advance force before going on an expedition to prepare the front lines, and then the main force can advance in order. Our steps for developing the Northwest are the same. First, form a sound organization, and then select specialized talents from the majority of comrades to form a Northwest Commerce Team (i.e., the advance force) to start with business, promoting the specialties of the Southeast and the goods of various cities to the Northwest, and transporting the products of the Northwest to the cities. The work of the rear association is to plan economic and material aspects to supply the front lines. On the one hand, concentrate talents, and when the front lines are smooth and have a considerable foundation, then send the majority of comrades from the rear to the Northwest to work in a steady stream. Such an approach seems to have a bit of certainty.</p>
<p>The above points are just a brief discussion. As for the detailed plan, it still needs to be studied jointly by the majority of comrades. There is no need to discuss it in detail now. I deeply hope that comrades who are interested in the Northwest cause will write letters to discuss it. And I beg the editor to advocate for it to see its success.

<p>Opening: "Yingying's Prayer"</p>
<p>The faint moon hangs deep before the West Chamber, with Hongniang attending the beautiful young lady. Seeking lodging at an endless inn, the two golden hairpins chime. Jade pendants sway with the sound of pearls, and a white silk robe carries an unusual fragrance. Jade ornaments face golden bracelets on her chest, and a string of pearls adorns her clothing, dazzling the eye. Silk trousers are embroidered with flowers, and a pink skirt flashes around her slender waist. Bow shoes step lightly around the flower street, where the peony blossoms have faded from the Peony Pavilion. Raising her head before the Night Cloud Pavilion, she sees nine-flowered lanterns hanging high. In her heart, she hopes to meet Zhang Junrui, encountering a kindred spirit beneath the Palace of Eternal Life. He will go through much hardship and care, like Kongming among the Three Kingdoms. The bright moon shines in the Emerald Garden, and a brocade-clad figure runs nimbly, like a clever spirit. May the wedding night come soon, and may the crier announce his fame. May she pluck the osmanthus from the lunar palace in autumn, and may they become a married couple for a hundred years, united in red thread. May they be forever together, never growing old.</p>

<p>Quiet scholarly atmosphere under the Silk Floss Pavilion. In the bell and drum tower, the clepsydra drips slowly. The eaves bells ring, tinkle. Cui Yingying calls to Hongniang with the voice of an oriole. Hongniang ah... the moon is bright, shining in the empty sky. Go see if Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Master Zhang is in his study. Deep thoughts, deep affection. The lovely pair, pair of beauties leaving the West Chamber. Late night, night after night, standing on the flower street. Grasses green, green grasses hiding ponds. Look, dense layers, layers of dense monks' quarters. Winding paths, paths winding around the corridors. Step by step, step into the pavilion. Adding, adding incense to the burner. Yingying bows, bows to the moonlight. Sweetly, sweetly, whispering to the heavens. Fragrance drifts, drifts into the study. Wishing him, quickly, quickly stepping into the osmanthus palace. The clever, clever maid, Hongniang. Lightly, lightly, calls out to her mistress. Miss ah, wait, wait, wait a moment, the Madam will know. Angrily, angrily, scolding Little Meixiang. Dew faintly, faintly, be careful of the dew. The moon moves, moves over the flower wall. Miss says repeatedly, yes, yes, yes. Steps busily, busily, returning to her room. Unsure of the day when they will be paired.</p>

<h3>A Comparison of Chinese and Western Architecture</h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a question often raised in architectural circles: "What are the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese and Western architecture?" It is not possible to make a simple judgment, because they are related to the entire history of the country and the customs and habits of the entire nation. Therefore, even after much research by architects and engineers, there is still no satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Before this question is resolved, we can use the perspective of an engineer to carefully compare the two types of architecture, Chinese and Western, in all aspects. Perhaps from this comparison, we can obtain a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>1.  Comparison of the Appearance of Chinese and Western Architecture</p>
<p>The first difference between Chinese and Western architecture is, of course, in appearance. The appearance of a building can represent the culture of each country and the habits of its people. The first characteristic of Chinese architecture is "magnificence" and "elegance," which foreigners call artistic "Oriental color." This is undeniable. Because of its four thousand years of history, Chinese architecture is full of the atmosphere of an ancient country. They are broad and proudly majestic, while at the same time, they are quiet and full of twists and turns, like the seductive smile of a young woman. However, the appearance of European and American architecture is completely different. They are firmly established, representing their newly rising countries. They are full of the spirit of "aggression" and "courage." This is their first characteristic.</p>
<p>2.  Comparison of Building Materials of Chinese and Western Architecture</p>
<p>Chinese architecture mainly uses materials such as wood, stone, brick, and tile. Among wood materials, fir, pine, and elm are used the most. Although Western pine has gradually been adopted recently, it is still not widespread. All building materials in our country have never had standard dimensions. For example, the manufacture of bricks and tiles varies, and there is no fixed table for the cross-sectional area of wood. This is because machines are not developed, and all materials rely on manual extraction and manufacturing.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned types, European and American building materials also include cement, steel, iron, and reinforced concrete. Because of their developed machinery, all materials are extracted and manufactured by machines. Therefore, the length and cross-section of wood have certain standards, and steel, iron, and cement have certain chemical compositions. They have detailed tests for the tensile strength, compressive strength, and shear strength of each material. Each material is tested by a material testing machine, and detailed results are recorded, making it easy for engineers to choose. In recent years, although major cities in our country have gradually adopted cement and steel as building materials, it is still not widespread. Most areas of the country still use traditional building materials.</p>
<p>3.  Comparison of the Design of Chinese and Western Architecture</p>
<p>The most important difference between Chinese and Western architecture lies in the design. In the past, the design of Chinese buildings mostly relied on the experience of workers. The analysis of forces and detailed drawings were lacking. Although this kind of architecture that relies entirely on experience is sometimes very safe, from the perspective of modern engineering, this architectural system has become outdated. There is no doubt about this. The difference in European and American architecture lies in this. During the design process, they analyze the internal and external forces of the entire building in detail. Various unexpected external forces, such as wind, snow, and rain, are all taken into consideration, and then materials are selected. These materials have certain shapes, such as I-beams and T-beams. They have a certain degree of strength and are able to withstand all the considered forces, so there is absolutely no danger. The result of this scientific design is that they can build solid buildings from several to dozens of stories high.</p>
<p>4.  Comparison of Architectural Equipment of Chinese and Western Architecture</p>
<p>The twentieth century is the century of all machines. Chinese construction relies entirely on manual labor, and its efficiency is extremely low. For example, manual pile driving is only three or four feet at most. In European and American countries, machine pile driving can reach forty or fifty feet deep, more than ten times the depth. This is why dozens of stories high buildings can stand tall. In recent years, the use of electric welding has become widespread in Europe and America. In the past, the joints of steel structures were tightly connected with rivets, which not only damaged the strength of the steel but also detracted from the aesthetics. Now, electric welding can be used to melt the huge joints into a whole piece of metal in a few minutes, and the increase in strength is almost five times greater than before. They use machinery in everything to achieve the highest efficiency.</p>
<p>In summary, the most important differences between Chinese and Western architecture lie in "design," "architectural equipment," and "materials." The only shortcoming of Chinese architecture is due to these three factors. In the scientific twentieth century, our architectural system based on "experience" and "manual labor" cannot survive.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Architecture in the Era of European Slavery (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>(B) Architecture in the Tigris-Euphrates River Valley</p>
<p>When we talk about Egyptian architecture, we think of the many beautiful buildings in the Tigris and Euphrates River Valley, which are equally majestic and grand. This is where the Babylonians, a historically strong and tough people, lived. Undoubtedly, their products reveal strong characteristics everywhere. However, their houses, and the Egyptian style we are talking about, have many fundamental differences.</p>
<p>First, there are no rich stone mines on either side of the Euphrates River and the Tigris River, so the Babylonians came up with a method of using sun-dried bricks to provide materials for their house construction. Using bricks, there can be curved places in the architecture, which is not as straightforward and simple as Egyptian architecture. Therefore, in the towering temples and palaces built by the Babylonians, we find places with arched architecture, which is extremely difficult for the Egyptians to do.</p>
<p>Second, the Babylonians were often invaded by the outside world, so their architectural talents were transferred to other things. The urban areas in which they lived were surrounded by extremely strong walls for protection, just like ours, and there were also things like enemy towers and crenellations. Moreover, their temples had very strange pointed towers, the meaning of which was probably also for observation and reconnaissance. Until now, we still cannot get rid of the construction of these pointed towers, especially in places such as churches.</p>
<p>Later, the Assyrians occupied this place, and they brought the method of stone construction. Later, the Chaldeans came, and they contributed many improvements to both brick and stone construction. Therefore, at that time, the gardens, palaces, and temples in Babylon became world-famous spectacles.</p>
<p>Among these many great buildings, there have been few changes in style over the centuries. What we should not ignore is that they are still built on the basis of tyranny and slavery.</p>
<p>(C) Architecture on the Aegean Coast</p>
<p>During the same centuries, architecture flourished on many small islands in the Aegean Sea, especially the famous island of Crete. Here we can see many architectural methods, very modern, almost the same as ours now. Their houses are no longer as simple as those built by the Egyptians or Babylonians. A house also includes many rooms, halls, and corridors. The comfort of the family is particularly advanced. In addition to paint and decoration, the house has bathrooms, springs, sewers, and various facilities, very much like a modern family now. The many small islands in the Aegean Sea naturally formed a stone bridge connecting east and west, from which the prosperous European culture of the next few thousand years was born.</p>
<p>This early amazing culture originated in the Aegean Sea, and later generations called it Grete, in memory of an ancient king of Crete named Minoan. The Minoan culture and architecture, although separated by more than five thousand years, is very modern. A palace in the Minas area is like a small city, with a total of four floors, including a large lecture hall, a bathroom with natural springs, and a theater. The drainage ditches and sanitation facilities are even more complete. Everything is far superior to what the Egyptians or Babylonians could do.</p>
<p>But what about our Asia at that time? We have already made great progress. Architecture in China was very developed, and it is clear that our culture developed before Europe. We cannot talk too much about this here, and we will write another article to examine the history of the development of our country's architecture.</p>
<h3>On Theatre Architecture (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>(7) Rest There are many cinemas without a rest room. Sometimes we arrive a little early. The previous movie hasn't finished showing. That's very annoying. Apart from standing at the ticket office, there's no other way to think. If the time is a little longer, it's stuffy and your feet ache. It's really annoying. Recently, some cinemas have already equipped rest areas. But we think the place is always too small. And there are no benches to sit on. So we hope that the cinemas built in the future can all have rest room equipment. And put more benches.</p>
<p>(8) Cold and Heat In the past, in the cinema, apart from using fans in hot weather and stoves in cold weather, there were no other cold and heat devices. Until recently, some cinemas have installed cold and hot water radiators. However, the temperature of these cold and heat devices should also be adjusted properly. If it is too hot or too cold, it is very cool in the cinema in summer. When you walk outside, it suddenly becomes hot. It is very warm inside in winter. When you go outside, you shiver from the cold. One cold and one heat are both not suitable. Many viewers have gotten sick due to the imbalance of cold and heat. So you must be careful.</p>
<p>(9) Toilets Of course, restrooms are also necessary facilities inside the cinema. But the location of the setting. Must also undergo considerable consideration when building. It is too close to the place where the audience sits and there will be a bad smell. Too far and it is very inconvenient to enter and exit. Therefore. The location must be compromised. Not too far and not too close is good. Some cinemas. Built on the basement level. Can completely isolate the bad smell. Of course, it is a very good method. Above the restroom. We really hope that there are lights or signs to indicate. Because some cinemas. Will make people unable to find the toilet.</p>
<p>(10) Fire Prevention Because cinemas are public places. In the event of a dangerous incident. It will cause a tragedy. So a cinema. When building. The materials used must be strong. To avoid the danger of collapse. Especially fire. The multi-setting of emergency exits. The purchase of fire-resistant drugs. Is a necessary event. In addition to fire insurance. There are many other dangerous events. Although the occurrence of danger depends on how it is managed. But when building. If you can pay attention first. Concern for the prevention of various disasters. It is also possible to eliminate disasters. And increase the safety of the audience.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Planting Trees on Sidewalks</h3>
<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>Planting trees on sidewalks has been a practice since ancient times. Zhou officials considered "the absence of trees on roads as a sign of poor governance." The legacy of Gan Tang's love has its origins in this. Walking is one of the four essential elements of life. All resting and leisurely strolls rely on these trees to provide shade and adapt to the needs of walking. Descending to later generations, markets became crowded, and residences were not repaired. Road administration gradually deteriorated, and rows of trees became disordered. Even if planted, they often failed due to untimely irrigation or frequent damage, undoing ten years of effort. Until modern times, with the progress of science, countries around the world have made tree planting a key element of urban construction. Therefore, the great powers have indeed made rapid progress in tree planting. And China, with its declining economy, can also strive to keep up with the trend, cultivating forests, developing planting techniques, and holding grand tree planting ceremonies every year. At the same time, provinces promote afforestation, deeply understanding that the benefits of this construction are not ordinary: (1) For the natural world, it can prevent natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and hail. (2) For production, it can supply construction, manufacturing, fuel, and animal husbandry. (3) For the human view of life, it can improve the environment, embellish the scenery, and is absolutely beneficial to health.</p>
<p>Therefore, in modern times, planting trees on sidewalks is an urgent task. All provinces and cities should implement systematic tree planting, and the people should cooperate in protecting them. After a long period of implementation, the results will naturally be remarkable! The trees in cities and provincial capitals can grow in about ten years. They can not only regulate the air and provide shade for pedestrians, but also dissolve pollutants, suppress dust, and increase the beauty of the city. It is especially beneficial to the health of the people, and its function is greatest. Trees are suitable for both summer and winter and have the effect of regulating the climate. Moreover, the respiration of trees is the opposite of that of humans, as they can release oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. Therefore, if there are rows of large trees in front and behind houses and on both sides of streets, humans will feel refreshed and healthy whether they live or walk. It can be known that planting trees on sidewalks is more than just a matter of urban construction; it is a major issue for the living and health of the people. If we extend this further, it is necessary to rely on tree planting to cultivate a strong nation, without a doubt!</p>
