<p>時評</p>
<h3>整理幣制</h3>
<p>素</p>
<p>近數月來。我國貨幣制度之整理問題。又引起國内公私各方之嚴重注意。卽以政府方面言。其己見諸事實者。則有幣制研究委員會之成立。顧將來全國幣制整理工作究能實現至何程度。此時猶未易言。甚望政府當局能高瞻遠矚。以謀整理方針之貫澈也。</p>
<p>夫幣制之統一。原爲國力强盛之反映。徵之現代先進國家。莫不皆然。反之。在今日國際關係之下。凡經濟上比較落後之國家。其國民實力之發展旣有所未逮。故其相因而生之貨幣制度。亦不能如先進國家之健全。全換言之。我國過去貨幣制度之所以形成極端紊亂之狀態。實有關於民經濟實力之薄弱。今欲從事於舊制之整理爬梳。使歸統一。以便利財富之流通。根要辦法。惟有集合國民之全體力量。開發産業。夫而後健全之貨幣制度得有所附麗而持諸永久也。</p>
<p>惟茲事體大。頭緒固甚紛繁。形勢亦多扞格。然舍此又鮮有捷徑可尋。數十年來言幣制改良者。儘多鉅製鴻文。讜言名論。卽客卿中精琦氏之議論。及甘未爾之主張。亦多有注意之價値。然關係國計民生之通貨制度。卒未嘗因是而有所改革。其故果安在哉。亦曰國民經濟之落後猶是。國際情勢之複雜猶是。雖具满腔熱忱以謀幣制之整理與統一。亦仍難能也。</p>
<p>吾人鑒於過去整理幣制之失敗。深冀今後能不蹈此覆轍。然其事則大難。無已。姑在治標範圍内。就較易着手而又應行注意之一事。爲負整理幣制之責者言之可乎。</p>
<p>我國通貨流通之現狀。實爲舉世所罕有。硬幣無論矣。卽就紙幣而論。流行於租界區域以内者。旣有本國各銀行之鈔票。復間有洋商銀行之兌換劵。至其準備何若。則往往不爲當地人民所知。此外在内地各處。甚至有以私人商店之地位。而發行類似紙幣之錢票或代價劵者。坐是。全國紙幣之種類。乃益趨複雜。夫吾國號稱銀本位國。然因紙幣之發行不能集中於一機關。從而充紙幣準備之現金亦呈分散之狀態。銀之屬諸各大發行銀行者。固居全國之少數。而屬諸政府機關者。則爲數尤微。一旦欲於此種狀態之下。使紙幣發行及現金準備爲事實上之集中。自感極大之困難。此則亟宜着手整理者也。今後我國果能於此一端。樹立根本整理之方針。使發行統一。準備集中。則未始非整理幣制之一助也。</p>

<h3>英報言之鑿鑿</h3>
<p>俄法訂軍事同盟</p>
<p>防衛性質五年爲期</p>
<p>日德兩國爲理想敵</p>
<p>技衛合作守望相助</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據今日星報載稱、法俄軍事恊定已於十一月二十二日由法外長賴伐爾與俄外委李維諾夫、各代表其本國政府在日内瓦正式接受、該報又稱、法俄商約亦於十二月十日最後簽字、聞軍事恊定規定以五年爲期，期满經雙方同意、得展長五年、並規定藉交換航空委員與軍事委員團以相輔助、法國委員團將赴俄國考察蘇俄軍事上之一切努力、俄國委員團亦將抱同一目的赴法考察、該恊定立卽發生效力、蘇俄將在法國技師指導下建造法國式飛機之引擎、法國將以小號坦克車四百輛運往俄國、俾可適用於各地、而法俄兩國軍事參謀部將以密碼由無綫電直接商榷一切、該恊定第一條聲明此純爲防衛性質、規定兩國參謀部交換技術的情報、以相合作、第二條指出日德兩國爲最可能之敵國、第三第四兩條規定航空之積極合作、第五條載明如蘇俄被日本攻擊、則法國不待商請、立卽担任以戰具供給蘇俄、其價値不得超過四十萬佛郎、如法德開戰、則蘇俄須以同樣價値之糧食供給法國、該恊定未言及出兵事、星報探悉法俄兩國稍緩將考慮波蘭之地位、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>東京回訓電逹倫敦</h3>
<p>海軍談話明日休會</p>
<p>三國將發共同宣言</p>
<p>重開日期並無規定</p>
<p>日本定耶誕節後通告廢約</p>
<p>英日由外交途徑賡續磋商</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英美日三國海軍代表、頃已商定决議草案、規定海軍談判延期舉行、并另就外交途徑繼續磋商、此項决議草案、已電逹東京及華盛頓政府請其查照、俟獲得復文表示同意後、此項决議案卽可成立、烸軍談話於是告一段落、該决議草案規定各項如下、</p>
<p>（一）此次談判中參加各方、得以明瞭對方意見、係屬有益之舉、（二）海軍談判延期舉行、（三）主張在短時期内重開海軍談判、（四）重開談判曁由外交途徑繼續磋商之日期、均由英國政府决定之。</p>
<p>至三國代表最後一次全體會議、仍定於星期四日在外交部舉行、又外相西門海外自治領地大臣湯姆斯均於今晨在海外自治領地部内、召集各自治領代表向其報告海軍談判最後進展情形、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日午後英外相西門至下院與美代表台維斯集議時、以英國所擬暫停英美日三國海軍談話之方案交與台氏、聞此方案並未規定談話復開之日期、但建議英代表如獲有續開談話之新根據、可再召集代表開會、又聞美言對此方案、以大體言、當可有美满響應、英代表明日將以此方案送交日代表、徵其同意、今日列席與會者、除西門與台氏外、尙有英外部克萊基與美使署參贊河塞頓、此殆爲英美主要代表間之最後一次集會、在舉行全體會議以前、所有之談判、將由次要人員辦理之、衆料本星期四日海軍談話將告休會、而日本將於星期五日或星期六日宣佈華盛頓海軍條約之廢止、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國政府向美國代表所提出之海軍談話延期文件、極爲簡賅、僅紀錄表面各種觀點、而於阻止談話産生圓满結果之各項困難、則未窮其本源、至關於重開談話之日期、因英國爲海軍談話之發起者、故當由英國决定之、在重開談話之前、並可由英國政府就外交途徑繼續磋商、蓋在實際上、英國與日本政府業已就外交途徑有所磋商、日本政府已以一九三五至一九三六年之海軍造艦程序、通知英國政府、此項造艦程序尙不出華盛頓海軍條約之範圍、（按華盛頓海軍條約宣告廢止後、其有效時期仍須至一九三六年底爲止）英國方面認爲满意、惟英國所欲明瞭者、則爲一九三六至一九三七年之造艦程序、日本究作何種打算、關於此層、現正盼待日本方面之答覆、但預料山本中將必將答覆、謂一九三六年至一九三七年之造艦計劃尙未决定、不能奉告云、由此可見英國已與日本以事外交談判、正與其他各海軍國從事外交談判相同、此外東京政府或將要求在倫敦繼續海軍談判、然此不過、爲一種善意之表示、日本之觀點並未有所變更、故三國談判不能因日本有此要求而繼續舉行也、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>東京回訓内容</h3>
<p>根本原則不變更</p>
<p>（東京）　外務海軍兩省接到日代表之請訓電報恊議對策之結果、决定根本方針、於本日明晨卽將發出回訓、其内容如左、</p>
<p>（一）日本對於軍縮之根本方針、一定不變、（二）英美兩國之休會提議、日本有授準備、但要確定重開日期、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　倫敦豫備會商訌於十九日午後四時召開三國圓桌會議、關於停會之共同宣言案有所採擇、然後暫行閉幕、至上項宣言案之内容、已於十八日由松平大使向廣田外相請訓、内中有擬定在英國認爲適當之時期再行開會之辭句、日本政府原希望明示再開日期、但考慮招請方面之英國立塲、縱令再次陳述、希望亦不過如是、故結局仍承認以英國認爲適當之時期再行召開豫備會商、對於此案似無異議存乎其間、故將此意業於十八日夜間發出訓令、電逹松平駐英大使矣、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　廣田外相關於停會宣言、已向松平大使發出訓令、此外尙有所謂對日英妥恊試案之訓令問題、現聞該訓令尙須逗延一兩日、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日代表覲英</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　海軍談判現已决定延期、在實行延期之前、日本方面未見有何建議、按照慣例、出席國際會議之外國代表、須俟會議工作完全結束時、方覲見國君、因此日本首席專門委員山本及駐英大使松平、將於本日午後、由英王喬治五世在伯金罕宮予以接見、山本頃並向哈瓦斯社記者發表談話、謂「有人詢問吾人、謂日本是否準備於必要時、將華盛頓海約满期後之日本造艦程序通知他國、抑知日本造艦程序尙未確定、此一問題不免引起重大困難」云云、山本於本日午間設宴欵待英美日本國代表團各專家、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日樞府通過廢約原案</h3>
<p>聖誕節後發出通告</p>
<p>（東京）　通告廢除華府海約問題、可於十九日在樞密院會議承認政府原案、當屬確實情形、政府訂於二十一日在閣議席上决定最後之手續、但發出通告之日期、因文件上之整理及其他等之關係、尙需時日、且一方面美國政府以及各國均在聖誕假期之中、有所未便、故結局該項通告之發出、當在聖誕節經過之二十六日以後云、（十八日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日上午十時、在宮中東溜間由日皇親臨開樞府本會議、提議華府條約之廢棄通告、經正式通過、卽日交與政府、因此政府召開閣議、正式决定後再奏請裁准、然後經齋藤駐美大使通告美國國務院、該通告全文如下、</p>
<p>逕啟者、本大使根據本國政府訓令、得通報閣下如後、引爲榮幸、日本政府根據一九二二年二月六日在華盛頓署名之限制海軍軍備條約、第二十三條之規定、對於美國政府通告有意廢棄該條約、日本駐美大使齋藤博、美國國務卿赫爾閣下、（十八日電通電）</p>
<h3>法對海約態度維持原來立塲</h3>
<p>海軍預算廿九萬萬佛郎</p>
<p>（巴黎）　參議院今晨討論海軍預算案時、海軍委員會主席黎阿發表宣言、謂德國海軍大有進步、法國海上防衛、殊嫌不足、應請政府設法修改華盛頓海軍條約、俾將法國原有之海軍總噸數加以擴充云、海軍部長庇特利當笑稱、法國向以華盛頓條約僅能满足當時之需要、至於日本要求法國共同宣告廢約、所以未加贊同者、則因法國不欲爲難英國、且不欲有離異之嫌故也、但法國對於華盛頓海約之立塲、則仍與一九二二年在華盛頓會諸中所說明者相同云、討論結束後、參院乃投票通過海軍預算案、計總額逹二十九萬零三百佛郎、較上屆海軍預算計增加二千四百萬佛郎、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美擬放棄海上自由促進英美合作</h3>
<p>國際監察軍火較易收功</p>
<p>一般認爲美入國聯先聲</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　據今日此間表示、美國傳统的海洋自由政策、在戰時某種條件下將自動放棄、參議員奈氏今日向美聯社稱、彼將提出議案、禁止美國商船於戰時與交戰國作商業往來者懸掛美國旗、此項提案之宗旨、在欲避免美國因保護其人民經營中立商業而被牽入將來戰爭之漩渦奈氏並謂、政府若干方面甚贊成其主張、且彼宣布此言之時、國務總理赫爾亦曾於最近表示國務院正在研究美國對於將來戰爭之中立政策、據政治觀察者之意、此項擬議之辦法、實爲美國修改或放棄海洋自由政策之先聲、因歐戰時、美國參戰卽爲維護此項政策也云、羅斯福總統顧問若干亦信美國應放棄此種對於駛往交戰國之船隻要求中立權利之政策、蓋自一八一二年來、美國已屢屢爲此而陷入國際漩渦、將來當更不勝其煩、並聞羅總統自身亦甚注意此事、據若干觀察者之意、此係總統主張限止戰爭利益及國際控制軍火運輸之自然結果、參議員奈氏並稱、此舉亦爲促進國際和平之表示、此間頗有種種懸測、卽總統旣知國民及國會公意贊成修改美國政策之後、是否將與其他國家共同討論、若干方面且懸測美國是否將於海軍條約廢止之後、以此事向英國提出、作爲兩國討論之前提云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美國前所堅持「海上自由」之傳統政策、頃有放棄之可能、一般人視此爲美國加入國聯會之第一步驟、蓋關於中立國船舶在交戰區域通行之權利問題、倫敦與華盛頓兩方面之見解、素相懸殊、卒致釀成嚴重爭議、茲美國若果抛棄此項政策、則國際間亦卽失去爭執機會之一故也、此間對於美國此舉、極感興趣、但在外交公文到逹之前、仍認爲係屬試探性質、將以覘美國輿論之動向如何、特際此美國參議院委員會調查軍火貿易、因而發生一種運動、主張國際統制軍火貿易之時、美國乃有放棄海上自由之議、亦非偶然之事、此則有可斷言者也、至關於國際統制軍火貿易問題、華盛頓苟欲與倫敦相接近、則英國輿論、自必樂於贊成、吾人猶憶十一月二十四日樞密大臣鮑爾溫在格拉斯哥保守黨會議發表演說、其中一段、謂在美國態度未能明白之前、則英國海軍决不能單獨對世界任何一國作武裝封鎖、其意若曰、世所主張對於侵略國加以制裁一層、在美國若非抛棄海上自由原則、而不堅持與交戰國通商、則封鎖侵略國、施以制裁、卽無異引起美國之反對、於以見海上自由原則、若果予以抛棄、則國際監察軍火貿易、自必較易爲力、而美國亦卽與國聯會較相接近矣、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美國國務院擬向總統羅斯福提出建議、主張將中立原則、完全加以修改、卽美國素向主張之海上自由原則、亦有放棄之可能、英國報界以爲白宮政見有所更變、于茲可見、晨郵報載稱、「羅斯福總統準備放棄海上自由之舉、對於英國政策、必有良好影響、或能促使英國參加歐洲大陸安全計劃、（按國務院新擬之原則、今後凡他國間發生戰爭、美國船舶、如冒險航行於作戰海面、則美國政府不予保護、如此則每値實行制裁、而封鎖侵略國港口時、英國卽無須顧及美國、而可放手爲之、）自最近十八月以來、美國態度往往出人意外、此次之事、尤非一般人意料所及、放棄海上自由一事、尙屬一種意思、雖未成爲具體提案、但國務卿赫爾業已提出研究、或已取得羅斯福總統之贊可、此其爲事、實足注意、則以美國政府傳統政策、擬加以重大變更故也、每日快報則謂「美國此舉、如果成爲事實、則英美兩國戰爭之最大潛能性、卽由此排除矣、英美兩國如果携手、則世界無戰爭之可能、而世界和平因亦獲有一大進步矣」云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>尼加拉圭鑿新運河</h3>
<p>美國商業國防均有利</p>
<p>海委會主席舊案重提</p>
<p>（華盛頓）衆院海軍委員會主席文生氏、現提出三十年前會爲人所主張在尼加拉圭築一運河、以輔助巴拿馬運河之建議、謂尼加拉圭運河之建築、實屬必要、因在五年内加拿大運河之閘門將嫌太小、不能安全容納現所造之新船也、渠故主張採行築此新運河之舊計畫、估計其費約需七萬二千二百萬元、新運河在商業上與國防上皆甚有利益、渠不久將與羅總統討論此事云、國會一般意見、大都贊成建築尼加拉圭運河、此運河造成後、將長一百七十二哩、乃由大西洋岸格萊墩經台細杜河桑若安河與尼加拉圭湖而逹太平洋岸白列墩、最合實用之航路、美國前曾得尼加拉圭國政府之同意、遣派工程隊四百人及以傑德溫中將爲領袖之測繪團、偕陸軍與民事工程師各二人、前往測量溝通兩大洋之路綫、測見共長一百七十七哩、其中七十哩穿過尼加拉圭湖、五十五哩穿過各河、此測繪團於一九三一年事竣回國、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）衆院巴拿馬運河事務小組委員會主席李氏今日聲稱、穿過尼加拉圭溝通太平洋大西洋之運河、至少在二十年内無此需要、蓋在商業上並無急需、在軍事上此時亦並不切要也云、李氏之言係因衆議員文生氏宣布、將在國會提議建築尼加拉圭運河而發、關於開鑿尼加拉圭運河事、今日東京方面雖有反響、文生氏則緘口不言、蓋東京外務省曾稱文生氏「不合時宜之宣言」、係表示美國之欲鑿此運河、實爲戰略關係、因所有商業交通之需要、巴拿馬運河已足以應付也、文生氏今日祇稱、其計劃如得國會通過、將先實行兩點、卽組織委員會研究運河路綫及其開鑿費用、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>林陸相將於明年視察傀儡實况</h3>

<h3>從排華的見解想到他們的友敵（續）</h3>
<p>但專勢又有出乎意料者，如前星洲殖民地代輔政司海尼氏，前月在牛津皇家帝國社暑期學校演講中，對於華僑創設的功續，雖曾表示驚異，但歸納其見解，竟有抑華的主張，未免遺憾、海氏對華僑之不满及過慮、約分下列三點：（一）華僑在馬來亞人口過多，如、霹靂及雪蘭莪之華僑、反較馬來人爲多、將來馬來亞有成爲中國第十九省之庭。（二）應擁護馬來人之利益以抑華人。（三）華僑　土生爲忠順英國之住民、而新移入之華僑則否。</p>
<p>關於第一點，查霹靂，霉蘭莪兩地華僑所以多的緣故，是因爲該地錫鑛區域廣大。據馬來亞聯邦鑛務年報所載、一九三○年調查的結果，馬來亞錫鑛租借地之總面積爲一八一·八一八英畝·其中霹靂占一一四，一○八英畝，雪蘭莪占四三·六八一英畝，兩地共占一五七·七八九英畝，丨丨即全馬來亞錫鑛總面積百分之八十六又七强。錫鑛暫時没有别　工人可適用，只有華僑最合宜，女是華僑最多之緣故，或許海氏不知道這個由經濟上分析得到的事實，所以驚奇起來，那也就難怪了。至於人多，旣是以工業經濟的條件建立一個行省·又是政治活動的問題，只須問問海氏、香港的華人最多，爲什麽不是中國的一個特别市？那末，他說話的評價，就立刻解决了。</p>
<p>關於第二點，所謂當擁護馬來之利益以抑華人，我想這句話，實在是没有從經濟的原則及經濟的事實去觀察所引起的誤解。曾記得有位英國人說過這句話：「要是没有華僑，恐怕亦不會有現在的馬來亞吧。」可知道華僑在馬來亞之經濟的發展，只是造成當地的繁榮，不過從繁榮裏赚得一點生活的資料。當地的繁榮，就是馬來人的繁榮，亦就居留地各種居民之「共存共榮。」不從經濟的事實及經濟的原則視察，只是籠統的說擁馬抑華，實在忽略了華僑因何而多，該地又何需這樣多中國人，我們從很多方面固可解答，但就最簡單的話可說是，該地華僑所努力的工作，歐西人不願做，而士人（馬來人）又不能做，這决不是我們的自負，的確是歷史以來的事實，海氏亦許忘記而誤解，假如有人再問一句，擁馬抑華是否同時擁美或抑英呢？那末，海氏又將若何的應對呢？</p>
<p>關於第三點，所稱華僑之土生爲忠順英國之住民，而新移入之華僑則否，也是帶着有色眼鏡所看到的情景。實際上從一般的情形說來，華僑之天性，忠實和平，在海外之勤苦，不特是任何國人所不及，而遵守當地之秩序法律，又是任何國人所難以比衡的。華僑土生旣習於純服之性情，此即華僑天性之遺延。或許新移入之華僑，對於當地情形不如土生之明瞭，且其帶有宗祖國觀念較厚，故而引起海氏誤認爲不忠順之表現，亦未可知。但是華僑由祖國帶到冒險犧牲的精神，海氏能多多從事實上去加細考察，就曉得華僑有助益於英國統治之處了。（未完）</p>

<h3>哈佛輪船昨已完全沈没</h3>
<p>挪威領署昨訊人證</p>
<p>保險公司打撈洋米</p>
<p>國聞社云、大發行代理之同德輪船公司同德輪船、自前晨與美順公司代理之挪威國哈佛輪船碰撞後、哈佛輪昨已完全沉没、所裝暹邏廣玉隆米廠運交上海伍廣際隆行洋米一萬六千五百包、則正由廣際隆雇工打撈、同時挪威駐滬總領事館、則傳集哈佛輪船人員、前往訊問、至同德輪船、將於今日拖入船塢修理、茲將各情分紀如下、</p>
<p>哈佛沉没　哈佛輪船、出事後、雖有匯德豐公司派大號駁船三艘、綁紥哈佛船邊、增加托力、减輕吃水、然以船頭之洞、浸水太多、且米被水浸、體量亦漸加重、故延至昨晨、依然沉没、匯德豐駁船、以襯托無效、亦解纜離去、</p>
<p>暹米來源　哈佛輪所裝洋米、爲上海四川路專營米木森林業·及各埠匯兌出入口貨之伍廣際隆行暹邏總生（廣源隆總行）所運來、該行在暹設有廣玉隆米廠·及廣金隆火鋸·等廠、此次運來一萬六千五百包洋米、曾分向揚子·怡和·紐錫蘭·等三家保險公司保險、惟共保若干、則廣際隆尙未接到暹邏總行之通知、</p>
<p>打撈洋米　哈佛旣已沉没、米浸水後、勢必膨漲、萬一超過船艙容積太鉅、船體且將炸裂、故昨已由廣際隆會同保險公司、僱用熟諳水性孔武有力之小工四人、着橡皮外衣、入艙撈米、但昨僅撈出四百餘包、今日將續繼打撈、</p>
<p>領館傳訊　駐滬挪威總領事館、根據哈佛輪報告、爲明瞭責行問題起見、昨日下午三時、特傳集該輪船主領江大副二副老軌等、到四川路一百十號、由該館副領事吉爾德爾、在靜室中、從長訊問、首傳船主蘇里訊問、至一小時、以次傳訊領江等、直至下午七時、尙未蕆事、</p>
<p>報告航局　江西路一三一號同德輪船公司、昨具函報告航政局云、逕啟者、敝同德輪、於本日晨、在浦中與挪威船哈佛相撞、敝輪船曾被撞壞、其詳細情形、容俟船主報告送來後、再行呈報、特先報告、卽祈查照備案爲荷、</p>
<p>航局檢騐　交通部上海航政局、前日下午、曾派技術員王新元、前往浦東陸家嘴、將哈佛輪船檢騐一過、惟王技術員、昨尙未將書面報告、呈復到局、至於同德輪船、本定於昨日、派員引航政局及保險公司騐船師、前往浦東四址三號浮筒、檢騐損壞情形、嗣以船中進水、不易透視、爰改定於今日（十九）拖進浦東（董家渡對面）椰松造船廠老船塢中、將水排出、明（二十）日再行檢騐云、</p>

<p>大戰危迫中上海防空建設重要</p>
<h3>蘇公望昨播音演講</h3>
<p>望市民集中力量建設防空</p>
<p>防空講座、自本月十八日起、每星期二下午四時二十分至五時、在中西電台、分請防空專家播音、昨爲第一次講演、由蘇公望氏講「大戰危迫中上海防空建設的重要、」立論頗爲精警、茲將蘇氏講稿刋錄如左、</p>
<p>二次大戰是必然性</p>
<p>自從「一九一八」的事變發生以後、日本運用其優越的武力、佔領我東北四省、造成了遠東方面的嚴重形勢、同時倫敦的經濟會議、日内瓦軍縮會議、結果都歸於失敗、而國際間和平條約、也同樣的等於廢紙、世界和平的秩序、已充分的感到了四面的威脅、因而開始展開了第二次大戰的序幕、爲了列强經濟的衝突、利害的予盾、於是「戰爭」便成爲了唯一解决的方法、我們看到最近在倫敦舉行的海軍預備會議、日本帝國主義因爲要實現强佔東亞大陸的企圖、堅持海軍比率的平等、甚至不惜孤立形勢的惡化喊出廢止海約的口號、而　於極端、這樣嚴重事態的發展、充分的暴露了、第二次世界大戰的必然性、尤其是遠東戰爭的必然性、但是我們分析這種大戰的内　和結果、不論日美戰爭先發動、或是日俄戰爭先發動我們中國都是不免於捲入漩渦的、特别是首當其衝的上海、那末、我們在這種嚴重的恐怖中、是不是甘願任人蹂躪、任人殺戮、任人侵佔呢、當然人類絶不會束手待斃的、不僅是不會束手待斃、而且還得考慮有效的應付方法、維護我們的領土、延續我們的生存、更從而復興我們的民族、這裏我們所謂有效的方法、就是健全的軍備、强固的國防、</p>
<p>戰爭形式多趨空軍　但是現在軍事方面的戰爭形式、自從歐戰以後、已是大大的改變了、因爲飛機的發明進步、戰爭工具發展的結果、已經轉入了新興、而更殘忍慘酷的形式了、曩昔人類听視爲神仙領域的太空世界、乃因航空器的發明、已經暢行無阻、因此現在的戰爭形式、除了陸地海洋之外、又開拓了空中、屠殺人類的新戰塲、同時戰爭的形式、也已由平面的陸海戰、而趨於立體的空中戰、已往的爭奪陣線、拼殺敵軍的局部戰、現在進而擴爲襲擊都市、毁滅敵國國力的全部戰、戰爭的範圍、因此也就没有前綫後方之别、和戰區非戰區之分、殺戮的目標、也不是在兵而是在民、因爲空中的敵機的進襲、旣没有山川的險阻、無處不可破空而深入、所以他的摧毁殺戮的範圍、也就没有界限了、一且戰爭開始、敵機進襲、國家的領土、人民的生命、都有玉石俱焚之虞、絶無倖免的可能、美國政治家勞塞爾說、「不出十年、歐洲發生大戰、大部份限於空中戰鬥、參加作戰的飛機、不下數萬架、大戰最長的時間、不過十二小時、」這簡單的幾句話、已經十足的顯示了未來大戰的趨勢、及現代空軍的力量、</p>
<p>國防首要建設防空　爲了空軍發逹的結果、應付的工具也就與時俱生、依照科學發明的定律、凡有主動的壓力、即有被動的反抗力、凡有新的兵器發明、即有抵禦的兵器發現、所以現時國防上的首要條件、就是防空的設備了、雖然、現代戰爭的中心工具、已經頌向於空軍、殘忍毒殺的程度、較之曩昔陸海軍殺人的效力、茜於千萬倍、但是現在各國除了講求軍事航空而外、同樣正在從事防空建設、於是大聲疾呼的喊着、「無防空即無國防、無國防即無民族」的口號、以期國民對於防空的認識、因爲現代國防的戰爭準備、設使僅作陸地海洋的平面抵抗、而缺乏了空中防衛的立體抵禦、無異是前爲拒狼、後不防虎、敵機空襲之　、就祇　束　待斃、任其摧毁屠殺而已、</p>
<p>世界各國儘力提倡　最近世界各國、提倡防空　備、如顚如狂、國民亦無不視爲切身　害之急圖、相率奮發其「愛國」精神、儘力援助政府的防空建設、及個人防護的設施、演習訓練、不斷施行、蓋戰爭的先决問題、是全在如何維護國力、置之安全、然後才可以言戰、惟能守始能攻、惟能維護國家的生存立塲、始能摧毁敵人的戰鬥能力、當着戰爭開始的時候、對方必挾其空軍主力、襲擊敵國的政治中心區、軍事策源地、重要的都市組織、以及一切有關作戰的力量、我們要抵禦、要制勝、那末先决的問題、也就是要有安全的秩序、和不斷的工商業之製造、而後民心得能鎭定、軍實得以補充、因此現在軍事的方面、不特要有防空的設備、就是非戰區域、也同樣的需要、健全的防空設施、試觀我國科學落後、國防軍備非常薄　、尤其是防空建設、簡直一無所有、證以淞滬戰役、日本倭軍的飛機、肆行轟炸、我們堅持數十天的國軍、終以没有防空的設備、而不能不宣告退却、忍辱停戰、結果我們滬市精華的閘北一帶戰區、受其轟炸、無辜的良民、死傷枕藉、公私的財産、損失無窮、我們在這一個無限的損傷之中、痛定思痛之餘、是已充分的感到没有防空的設備、就是没有安全的保障、換句話說、國防的準備、没有防空的設施、是不足以抵禦侵略的敵人、人民的生命、没有防空的設備、是不足以得到延續的生存、</p>
<p>淞滬華北慘敗敎訓　年來國人雖受　東北淪亡、淞滬華北戰役慘敗敎訓、曾有一度提倡航空救國的熱烈情緒、一呼百應、頗有相當的成績、可是大家都忽略了國土防空的整個問題、我們旣要謀以我機驅逐敵機、使其不能侵越我領土的上空更而掩護我要地、消滅其摧毁屠殺的力量、當然不能不充實我們防空的航空建設、以期保守、再行言攻、但同時一遇敵機投彈散毒、那未我們更不能不有抵禦解救的準備、所以我們不但先要有健全的軍事防空而且是要有普遍的民間防空、使人民得以　事於解救轟炸、避免毒殺的慘禍、進一步而保全其生命、維護其財産因此我們民間防空設施、確是刻不可緩、不能稍一忽視的、但是要實施民間防空、人民就得要知道敵機空襲所施的爆炸彈、燒烯彈、毒氣彈的防禦措施和解救的方法才能獲得實效、因爲空軍襲擊敵國後方的要地、和屠殺人民的手段、祇有這樣三種、我們能够有應付這三種手段的解救設施、也就可以說是有了民間對空的防護　以我國領土之遼闊、海岸綫之延長、現時旣乏防空設施、一旦戰爭爆發、整個河山、固將盡淪敵人空軍之手、隨時隨地、都有覆滅的可能、然而首當其衝的、更是各處的重要都市、</p>
<p>防空建設更不容緩　上海爲遠東的交通樞紐、世界巨大商埠並且是我國的經濟中心、國都的第一道防綫　假使敵人空軍侵襲、必然的較任何地方視爲重要那末我們上海所受的危難、也就勢必較任何地方爲慘烈、這是不容諱言的、因此上海地勢的重要、在整個國防條件上、防空建設、更不容緩、現在上海繁盛地區的面積、總共不過二百四十方里如果以現代空軍所使用的毒氣彈、在一方里之　、施用三十公斤的毒氣、能可毒殺、一切人畜做比例、那末、二百四十方里的地方、祇要七千二百公斤的毒氣就可把我們上海三四百萬的人口、整個毒死、而且現在飛機所携帶的重量、通常是在一千公斤以上、假使敵人空軍、已抱定了來毒殺我們上海的目的、至多也祇要五六架飛機、就可成功、何况他所施行的空襲手段、是毒氣彈·燃燒彈·同時投彈的、那末我們上海的禍難、更是無可避免了、况且將臨的大戰、一旦發生、由不是某幾國的單獨戰爭、必然的會引起世界各國的總動員、造成人類的大屠殺、我們曉得宣戰的對象、旣然是多數國家、那末、所謂安全區域的上海租界、也是同樣的免不了空軍轟炸毒害的危險、或者因　精華集中於租界、其危險反而慘烈、這種將有的險象、並不是過甚其　、前兩天公共租界的防空演習、祇要我們從其盾意上去探討一下、也就知道了不是偶然的動作、是値得上海人民大大的警覺的、</p>
<p>集中力量救己救人　但是這種危險、固然是令人畏懼、令人悚戰、可是這種禍難的解救的方法、就祇有賴乎全上海的市民一致動員、集中全力、來作救己救人的防空建設、不然、全市的繁榮、旣將變爲瓦礫的空塲、而此時市民健全的身軀、也就是來日横飛的血肉、俗語所謂、「上海灘、上海灘、必有一日變爲黃浦江」、時至今日、上海的地位、旣是感覺到這樣的危險、我們如不自覺的積極從事防空建設、俗語是有實現的可能、那末、我們如果是想要保存國家領土的安全、維護生命財産之存續、就祇有集中我們自動的力量、死裏逃生、建設鐵網的防空、抵禦敵人、捍衛國土、才是唯一的生路云、</p>

<p>Ｘ二七在滬</p>
<h3>神秘女發表談話</h3>
<p>在滬廣交遊　恃日語爲生</p>
<p>邂逅法軍官　演出今日事</p>
<p>一二八滬戰時曾爲日軍偵探</p>
<p>外論社本埠特訊、關於駐日某國大使館武官輔佐泰氏密克羅氏、利用日本婦人、以挑色戰術、進其間諜工作、業誌各報、泰氏利用日本婦人甚多、其中聞最主要者、卽僑居上海之門無照子其人、門無照子係神户某英語學校卒業、抵華後、歷遊南京·漢口·香港·等處、最後僑居上海、以敎授歐美人之日本語爲生、</p>
<p>混血女　但傳聞照子係日人與葡人之混合種、交際甚爲廣大、一二八滬戰時、照子曾一度爲日軍偵探、頗有功於日本、故日方仿歐戰時、德國某有名間諜之往事、亦譽照子爲Ｘ二七號、故凡道及Ｘ二七號者、幾無人不知、足與川島茅子相嫓美、該女現寓件虹口南洋路二○八號公寓之八號室、年雖四十、而貌甚美、獨身居處、生活極爲神秘、而門無照子亦屬一西洋崇拜論者、故在滬避忌與日人來往、照子與泰氏結識、亦係淵源於敎授日語、其中自有若干隱情、但此事在東京揭發之後、門無照子在上海亦同受影響、惟照子爲表白其個人心跡、特發表談話如下、</p>
<p>美男子　茲閱日本新聞、不勝駭異、初閱本地邦字新聞、以爲謠傳、微夜未眠、然翌朝英文報紙登載、竟將泰氏名字、亦揭出來矣、此事來之驟然、眞屬夢想所不到、泰氏中尉、乃我之日木語生、我三年半前、從内地到上海、歷遊中國各地、個中非常無聯、不得已乃在英文報紙特登廣告、敎授日本語文法、不意此廣告、竟爲泰氏中尉所見、就學於我、此爲莫可預料之事實也、當時泰氏爲砲艦之一員、彼爲靑年白色之優美男子、舉措非常優雅、在我處學習日本語、爲期不過六閱月、</p>
<p>間諜報　後卽轉任法領印度支那之東京領事館、復行學習日語、未幾彼以三角戀愛關係事件發生、旋歸馬賽、當時彼海軍部缺乏日本之翻譯官、泰氏卽進行其留學日本計劃、果然試騐及格留學期爲一年、在其赴日時、途次上海、再來訪我、此時我適從法租界搬到公共租界爲其在日之生活便利計、特貢獻到日之種種意見、此時我房中尙有其他學生、亦係某國之武官、彼等二人相見、以英語交談、彼此甚歡、泰氏便問「貴國之諜報工作、現歸何種機關工作、」該武官卽答、「一切皆屬於大使館」我非軍人、當然不悉其彼等會談之情節、</p>
<p>一年來　不過我以爲彼等到日本之目的、完全爲研究日本語、故介紹有東京知人之家庭、同時並勸其斷絶社交、專心攻讀、而且主張其抵京之後、若能與日本之上流家庭及日法語之交換敎授相結識、則殊有諸多方便也、彼抵東後、卽來信告知其現狀、我以爲彼此男女關係、究易惹起外人注意、函知其以後自重、乃去年十二月間、彼以任期屆满、準備歸國、先致書於我、痛論日本語之難解、一年來並無多大心得、我勸其一國語言、非一朝可期、循序漸進、自有成就、彼以我之言爲忠告、特别表示謝意、</p>
<p>絶音信　乃今閱新聞所載、完全與事實相反、此爲我不勝悲感之事實也彼之信乃本年四五月間被警察注意、我七月間搬家後、曾有告知其搬家之事、由大使館轉交、以後簡直音信斷絶、我爲彼之日本語良師、此在我平常通之忠告敎訓當中見之、謂我與彼爲間諜工作之活動、則非我所逆料者也、我非吃茶店、跳舞塲·咖啡館·之女性、任何時候、亦未忘誇稱日本之意識云云、日前報載日本憲兵已將其拘捕審訊、押解東京、觀此談話、可知未盡詳確、Ｘ７２固仍在挾其言語技術、逍遙滬上也、</p>

<h3>主將罰出江灣敗得可惜</h3>

<p>四比五比四三負二分</p>
<p>江灣與麥令、昨晚相遇於西靑籃球會甲組賽中、江灣表演極佳、競爭之劇烈、實爲本季寒中所僅有、上半時交綏之初、麥令即以四比○、六比一佔先、復旦幾經激鬥、一鼓作氣、脫類而出、最盛時代曾以十六比八佔絶對優勢、嗣後麥令緊緊相逼、形勢極爲嚴重、彼來此往、大有難分軒輊之勢、上半時完了、麥令仍以二十三十二十一追出二分、江灣之所以小挫、蓋由於周逹雲陳宗祺均被罰下塲、以致元氣大傷、下半時内雙方更形接近、忽起鵲落、比數捉摸不定、江灣曾兩度以一分之差而佔先、最後戰成四三比二時、張錦華亦因犯規四次、被罰出塲、於是麥令乘隙猛襲、先成四三比四三之和局、距結局一分鐘時、復爲麥令約翰遜近擲中的、結果江灣終以四十五比四十三、二分之差、遭受敗并、另一塲曁南大勝持志、形勢傾於一面、比較六十九比十九、</p>

<h3>一場足球大戰約翰滬江和局</h3>
<p>約翰曾以三比一佔優</p>

<h3>啦啦隊各有特色</h3>
<p>兩校同學到塲助威者、共有七八百人、約翰並帶銅鼓到塲、雙方校歌開塲、繼作各種啦啦調、約翰由三人導領、其中某君擅機巧運動、登塲作連環空心觔斗博得掌聲不少、滬江到塲較遲、由五人領導、其中有兩位女性、且一爲碧眼黃毛之西洋女子、白褲黑衫、嬌聲滴滴、足使約翰啦啦隊减色</p>
<h3>論球藝約翰較勝</h3>
<p>以球藝而論、約翰實較滬江爲佳、攻勢亦以約翰爲盛、且短傳美妙、全隊平均聯絡一致、徐承勛之左内衛穩健老練、足稱個中翹楚、中堅李華興、亦殊出色、前鋒吳振邦勇敢善戰、兩翼尙佳、善開角球惜朱文極長力不足、未後一無作爲、滬江馮念華之中堅、四面招顧、百無一失、前鋒以錢敬鏞最佳、錢君固昔日東華名將也、兩翼軟弱、全仗中間三人、兩隊守門均庸俗不堪然約翰之不勝、實射門不佳耳、</p>

<p>三時三刻、日色無光、含有雨意、啦啦隊打起精神、作加油工作、滬江開球先攻、來往未久、約翰右翼王秉惠帶球攻進、被阻於滬江陳家導、約翰陳繼思竄上刧得、殺至門下、滬江周公亮非法阻擋、被罰十二碼球、約翰左内衛徐承勛主踢、一舉成功、首開紀錄、</p>
<h3>三比一滬江受屈</h3>
<p>滬江頗有膽怯之病、約翰前鋒得以猖獗行事、傳遞美妙、使滬江疲於奔命、更以守門胡褒躡手躡足、膽小如鼠、不數分鐘、又被吳振邦攻入一球、滬江力圖報復、錢敬鏞勇冠三軍、約翰在門前三十碼處被罰任意球、錢敬鏞一脚踢出、球勢甚急、正對門中、約翰守門撲空、球乃飛入網中、奪回一城、未幾、滬江守門遲疑誤事、吳振邦又下一　、約翰以三比一遙佔上風、</p>
<h3>上半時三三和局</h3>
<p>滬江全軍震怒、努力反攻、錢敬鏞與約翰馬立斯搶球互跌、潘昭凱坐收漁利、送至約翰門前、時約翰内衛站立太出、遠水不濟近衣、反身不及、被滬江李汝超怒射中鵠、成三與二之比、約翰馬立斯　球滬江門前、被約翰前鋒又湧入一球、但爲越位不計、王秉惠送出角甚佳、亦不濟事、約翰攻勢極盛、不料後方空虚、滬江偷渡陳倉、錢敬鏞又立一攻、成三比三和局、於是滬江聲勢大振、他汝超猛射一球、約翰守門一個轉身、仆地救出、美妙無比、嘆觀止矣、</p>
<h3>下半時徒勞往返</h3>
<p>上半時終了、已鐘鳴四下、天色陰沉、益顯暮色蒼茫、除非搶燈夜戰、决難終局、故踢至二十五分之過半數時間、裁判員宣佈停賽、雙方無所獲、以三比三和局而散、此二十五分鐘間、競爭形勢、殊爲緊張、滬江兩人衛特别賣力深　高壘、使約翰不得越雷池一步、但約翰勢如破竹、圍攻不已、聯珠砲射、然大都軟弱無力、或成野球、一無可獲、負負而已、</p>
<h3>京都籃球盟主國體再度征滬</h3>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任敎平視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>於是就在胡嫂子站起來站起來的聲中，眞個的站起來了。不知不覺的，也就把那根香烟接到了手裏。他不會抽烟、又不敢放下，拿了那根香烟在手上，没個作道理處。加之他和賈多才站着很近，差不多是鼻息相通。越是這樣相隔得近，那賈多才越不老實，向月英臉上，狠命的看着。他並不是犯了近視，要這樣才看得見，他是要借了這個機會，細細的看月英的皮膚如何。可憐月英在不許害臊的情形之下，只得通紅了臉子，讓他看着。胡嫂子笑道，你呆在那裏作什麽？把香烟送到賈老爺嘴裏，擦根洋火替賈老爺點上。你要知道，姨太太伺候老爺，就是這樣的伺候。月英因他當面說破了，不能不照着他的話辦，這就將烟送到賈多才嘴邊，他眞的一彎腰，把烟捲啣住了，自然，那臉上是帶了笑容的。他手扶了桌子，在手邊便有一盒火柴。於是拿起來擦了一根，直伸着向烟捲頭上送來。這當然是一個外行的姿式，賈多才於是一伸手將他的手握住，讓他扁平過來，這才把烟點上了。他笑着放了手，才道；以後點烟，要學這個樣子，要不然，會把吸烟的人眉毛都燒掉了。月英怕他當面看，他索興來握住了手，便是難爲情，也只有忍受了。胡嫂子看到，却是從旁凑趣道；這樣說起來，賈老爺是答應這件事了。賈多才笑道：你何以見得，我是答應這件事呢？胡嫂子笑道：你不是說了以後全要照這個樣子和你點香烟嗎？賈多才笑這：我是譬方這樣的說。假使我說的辦法，你們都願意，這事就成了。（九三）</p>
<h3>屠牛場</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>在那寛闊的馬路上，矗立着一宅高大的鋼骨水泥築成的工塲，四週給矮矮的圍墻包圍着，給水冲得成了淡紅色的血液，不絶地從水槽裏向外流着。</p>
<p>這是一個屠牛塲，這是一個供給全都市裏每一個菜市裏發售鮮牛肉的總機關。</p>
<p>據說，每一條牛，在屠宰機器裏，是儘也用不到二分鐘，不只可以喪失了生命，皮給整張的揭掉，而且心臟肝肚，都已給整理就緒，整個肢體，也都給支解開，洗濯乾凈了。用這種機器的敏捷的動作屠牛，說的是很合乎人道的，因爲這比了用土法宰牛，使每一條牛，挨了幾十刀，還没斷氣的，自然是强得多了。</p>
<p>但是當我每天打從屠牛塲前面經過時，常見成羣的牛，給牛主人押着走進屠牛塲去待戮。說也可怪，每一條牛走到離屠塲門口十丈左右時，總是放緩着步子不肯走。牛主人不住地用鞭着，可是鞭了一下，走了二步，又立住了。有的索性跪在地下，不肯站起來。有的竟從眼裏淌出淚來，長鳴不已，似乎都知道生命是快要斷送了。</p>
<p>頑童們每天是那麽的等待着牛羣的光臨，每天是持着小竹竿，打着牛臀爲笑樂，可是當牛兒跪在地上長鳴時，也有給怔住了，不知不覺的把小竹竿兒掉在地下的。一直到牛羣給主人用力的一一拉進了用鋼骨水泥築成的屠牛塲裏，才没精打彩的走開去。</p>
<p>過了不多一會兒，水槽裏的血水，便又汩汩地流出來，又過了一會，蒸發着熱氣的整塊的牛肉，已裝上運貨車，送到市上去發賣了。</p>
<p>接着，門口又來了一羣待屠的牛。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 水鍔</p>
<p>中國人喜歡把一雙手籠在衣袖裏，所以遇事都「袖手旁觀」。</p>
<p>不但袖手，又往往喜歡紥褲脚，所以一旦有事，大家都「裏足不前」。</p>
<h3>「厚臉先生」</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>我的古怪朋友很多，厚臉先生其一也。先生本姓鄒，父急病死，其母再醮於黃某，乃亦跟着姓黃，或有非難之者，彼忿然作色曰：「這是我的孝思，報娘恩，亦是我的自由，我再姓上張，鄭，李，趙，都不容誰求管！」衆皆啞口無言，暗笑而退，此「厚臉」之名之所由來也。</p>
<p>先生的容貌，雖不異於常人，但亦獨具風格，鼻子扁而大，眼圓小如鼠，嘴唇厚而且闊，笑時作吃人狀，面團，本係富者之相，但在煩邊有麻子三五點，不免壞了風水，兩眉濃黑，略帶兇態，故其面部表情，常呈尷尬之色。友輩以其天性尙稱忠厚，樂與交接。然而，先生固一多情稱子也，常託友人爲其作伐，且攝就大夥照片，分送如發傳單。適某團體開會，到有一女會員，先生卽以Ｘ委員代表名義向伊大獻殷勤，代脫大衣也，換手巾也，初以卡片進，繼示以著作，旋該女因内急，彼自充嚮導，不料直逹内室，爲其他如厠女賓呼斥而退，反責女賓腦筋陳舊不止。於是「厚臉」之名傳播益廣矣。</p>
<p>某日，我正在家中欵待兩位妻舅，冷盆四色，紹酒兩斤，正待舉筷，而厚臉先生至矣，乃急拉其至廂房中，告以今日爲内親叙談家事，不便呌先生做入幕之賓，並暗示其速去，可是他却無動於中，堅要我介紹介紹，無奈，只得速之入座，一句話還没出口，他已筷下如雨點，且吃且說道：「人生在世，什麽都還本是空的，只有吃，才最實惠，兄弟生平相信吃，就是死了棺材不要都可以。」凑巧這時鄰婦在駡偷嘴貓兒：「畜生，明天買包砒霜毒死你！」厚臉先生似有所感，未終席卽引去。</p>
<p>翌晨來一函云：「昨日至後門，方知我已誤會駡聲，再想回進來，似有關面子，因有令親在座故也，肉絲菜心未得大嚼，可惜，可惜······」其臉之厚，一至於此，嘆觀止矣。因作「厚臉先生」，以揚仁風！</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第十九章　狐仙塔</p>
<p>「今天，我們必須上狐仙塔去走一遭，那邊也是一處很有名的所在！」當我們展謁歷代帝皇的遺物之後，第二天早上，太后的悉思已减殺了許多；伊梳洗過後，便計劃着要想出去遊玩了。伊的行動當然是絶對可以自由的，伊儘可不必徵求我們的同意，隨便把我們帶到什麽地方去；但伊往往歡喜賣弄伊自己的見聞，每逢有一件新的事物發生，或是將上一處新的所在去之前，伊總得先給我們說一些大槪的情形。這時，伊又照例的向我們說道：「關於狐仙的故事，我們已經聽到了好久了！這座狐仙塔，便是懺悔以後的修鍊之所，我們旣到了奉天，少不得要去走一遭，不然是很可惜的！」</p>
<p>「那末，它的故事是怎樣的呢」？我們一半爲好奇心所驅使，一半爲凑伊的趣起見。便一同向伊請問底細。</p>
<p>伊果然很得意地笑了，立卽允許告訴我們：其實我們就是不問，伊也必自動會告訴我們的。於是我們便聽到了一節聞听未聞的關於千年九尾狐的故事。以下是太后的話：</p>
<p>「在這位狐仙没有降生爲一頭狐狸之前，它畢竟是怎樣的一頭野獸呢，這是没有一個人能够答復的；就是天上的玉帝，也許也說不出來。大家只知道它的前生必然是一種很兇惡可怕的東西，對於人類，也祇是有害而無益的。但詳細的情形，就不淸楚了。」（二○三）</p>

<h3>上海的戰爭文藝之一</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>丨丨關於鴉片戰爭的詩歌</p>
<p>對於上海史有準確認識的人們，都很明白鴉片戰爭和上海是怎樣的關係。如今舊事重提，我們都不免爲淸政府的顢預無能而歎恨。雖然這樣，那吳淞之戰的經過，實是一段悲壯的史實。那些流傳下來的詩歌，描述當時事態的波動，我們現在讀起來，還感覺得那「民族英雄」的偉大呢。</p>
<p>一八四二年六月九日，英國兵艦開到吳淞海口附近；制台牛鑑駐節寳山城裏，江南提督陳化成駐守西砲台，徐州鎭總兵駐守小沙背，署蘇松鎭總兵周世榮駐守東砲台。到十二日，英軍連檣而進，我軍嚴陣以待。那時緊張的情景，眞如楊晋階所說：</p>
<p>「雲昏朝灑千夫淚；</p>
<p>月冷宵沈萬灶烟。」</p>
<p>又如蔣敦復在　頴川將軍行」裏說：</p>
<p>「峨峨巨砲東西臺，樓船横海風烟開，</p>
<p>此是江南金鎖鑰，紅羊萬里唱檀來。」</p>
<p>十六日，戰事開始，陳化成對壘開砲，適軍都家重大創傷。後適軍向東砲台，小沙背攻打，小沙背兵先退，東砲台兵接着潰敗，牛鑑棄城而逃，寳山城遂入英軍手。但這時西砲台却還是竭力抵抗，至死不　，結果，陳提督等八十一人殉難。</p>
<p>貝靑喬，有名的蘇州文士，曾諷咏其事說：</p>
<p>「海蜃妖氛逼幟竿，爭看仗鉞奮桓桓。</p>
<p>睢陽毅魄能爲厲，請劍應先斬賀蘭。」</p>
<p>蔣敦復氏也說：</p>
<p>「豈有龍韜稱節制，漫勞虎僕誤軍籌。</p>
<p>萬事從來悲掣肘，如此雄關偏失守！」</p>
<p>對於稱爲「制台」的牛鑑，都表示不满；而宣揚陳化成的壯威和勇敢，貝氏在「滬瀆謁陳忠愍公祠」詩裏更加有力的了，如下：</p>
<p>「一戰甬江口，督臣死，提臣走。再戰吳淞口。提臣死，督臣走。三戰乃及金陵城，江濤寂靜不聲，陳將軍後誰敢兵。君不見，走者棄諸市；死者長如生。長如生，尸祝徧我海徼氓。」</p>
<p>原來，英軍自經攻下吳淞，上海以後，便得溯江而上，打下鎭江，進窺南京；於是淸廷忍辱議和，江寗條約訂定，上海開關商埠。（租界的劃定，又是一事）蔣敦復氏的詩裏，表示十分感槪，說：</p>
<p>「江頭告敗日紛紛，死事流傳尙未眞。</p>
<p>霸上棘門等兒戲，蕭娘呂姥各全身。</p>
<p>聞道今年已通市，朝廷自爲蒼生計。</p>
<p>鐲租詔下萬人歡，可憐六郡良家子。</p>
<p>此役，除陳化成等外，上海地方官死難的只有典史楊慶恩一人，浙省也只有縣丞李同陽，吳史余福，以及總督裕謙而已。貝靑喬另著一首詩說，</p>
<p>「唱徹臨江節士歌，歌聲流憤满關河，</p>
<p>如何爲國捐軀者，祇是聾丞醉尉多。」</p>
<p>他是對於當時士氣的消沈，官塲的卑怯，都駡盡了。</p>
<p>這些詩歌，將永久的流傳，流傳民族的幽光。</p>

<p>昨日洋米市况、形勢初居半象、繼有洋商以二月份小絞四元八角四分之價求售、二三月份回籠小絞前開四元八角八分者、今山泰　萬豐等售出已撳小一分、及至午後以匯水縮短、四　八角四分之二月小絞未能成議、市上人心又復安定矣、現洋米由本　辦去機米二千二百包、因地去碎米二百包、價均微軟、回籠期米成交九百噸、客秈昨有　沙　活動、本街亦暢市面甚佳、但内地停頓、行情亦　上分　好云、</p>
<p>本市定購之洋米絡續來滬、計前日挪威　　哈佛號裝載𨗴維米一萬六千五百包紐滬　、不　被撞沉入浦底、昨日已從事打撈、又昨被招商入浦東楊家渡兩棧、聞今日法公司之安得來朋號到滬、有四　米一萬九千包、預定存儲招商局中棧云、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>新枝赤開十三元</p>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢稍佳、公會劃盤　四粗砂白現貨十八元四角半、比前日升五分轉口貨呌五元角半、萬九號　赤十四元半、比升角、普通八九號呌十四元、轉口貨呌五元、太古糖及本廠棉白均原價無變動、國産首量新石門片靑到百包、當即開出、價爲十一元、新枝赤到十七包、開十四元、新潮靑近日地價以申市見降、变有隨鬆、但　昨訊、因現市均須虧本、故到汕之貨漸稀價乃復緊、且此間銷路正旺、後市似無鬆望也、</p>
<p>本埠糖之進口、向以日本及嗬囒爲大宗、惟近日日　進口略見减少、嗬囒糖前日（十七）渣華　可之芝巴德號進口、裝載　萬包之鉅、</p>
<h3>閘北貨</h3>
<p>金山枝號盤暗鬆</p>
<p>金山枝内以走銷呆滯、市勢　　逾　、號盤無正　開出行號零華成交價亦暗鬆不少、如普通貨、較好者亦不上三十元、次明更無論矣、何時　、售出更見紊亂、惟市價至此、似可轉定耳、</p>

<h3>我們的時代和文學</h3>
<p>— 狄舟</p>
<p>我們試睜開眼看，這時代人類的全生活，丨社會的，文化的，是如何地在普遍的洪浪中翻騰！我們試靜溯過去的歷史，怕找不出像目前這樣豐富，蓬勃的生活狀態吧！最淺顯的例是：在任何一天裏，我們都知道人類是如何地絞盡着他們的腦汁，和使盡着他們的力量丨或是大規模的生産建設完成了，或是多數的生産機關破産了，或是有價値的科學發明成功了，末了，或是戰鬥的遂行丨戰爭，軍擴，談判，擾亂······</p>
<p>這些，都可以由每日的報章雜誌，來報知我們。縱然在目前這萬花筒一般的繁饒現象中，給與人們的喜悅和哀痛，兩不相等，以及給與人們的影響和作用，各有相異，但我們不能不說：這時代，是曠古未有的偉大的時代，不倫自那一方面說！</p>
<p>這樣，今代的文學，能有怎樣的發展呢？丨這是値得考察的一個問題，同時，對於現代的文學靑年們，是一個不能不提出而要求回答的問題。</p>
<p>由史官看，古希臘的悲劇，只在當時保持着均衡的純熟的奴隷文化裏可以産生。也只在十六世紀下期英國的手工業和商業資本逹到高度的發展的條件下，才使英國的文化急速提高，才出現了莎翁的國寳似的戲劇　批評家並未抺殺個人的天才，但個人的天才，是存在於社會裏面。所以燦爛的藝術，偉大的作品的産生，只在這當的社會條件底下，才有可能。並且，不同的社會狀况和條件，産生出不同的藝術或作品。莎翁的悲劇之不同於古希臘的悲劇，便是後一點的說明。「鐵流」。「士敏土」。「毁滅等無聯的紀念碑的名著，只能在軍事結束之後才出世，便是前一點的最好的例子。</p>
<p>而今代的社會條件是怎樣的呢？目前的社會具象是給與文學以怎樣的發展條件呢？我們可從兩方面的來考察。</p>
<p>第一：目前社會諸具象，最高度地反映了人類的理性内容的全部。自古至今的舊的模樣，以及近代才雛型，現今才突進的新的恣態，都同時有血有肉地存在着。黑格爾所連聲讚嘆的「安蒂峨尼」一劇裏人類的「崇高」，烏拉迪米爾所神往的托爾斯泰的作品裏的一個時代全景的展開，等等，現在是更加遼闊，更加深遠，更加湛邃地呈示於人們之前了。丨這是說，今代的現實，供給了文學一個豐满無比的内容。以它在發展中的旋律和顫動，它，不但提未了遍山满谷的「平凡」材料，而史格外地，指劃出中心的，「意義」所在的内容。由這點說，今代的周圍，提供了以前所没有過的偉大的文學内容的素材。丨不是嗎，認眞的人們不是在吸收這素材，組織這素材，而孕育成蘇聯，日本，德國······的朝陽似的輝煌之光嗎？</p>
<p>第二：文學新地的開拓，至目下止，已留下了不少搖撼着今代人們的心靈的紀念碑。這些，至少是做爲今代文學的開拓者的路標，而光芒四射地存着。一般說來，現在我們有偉大地創作的條件。自思想的批判，以至新技巧的應用，都有多量的模型和充足的經騐了。但這條件，因各地的歷史的發展的不同，顯出程度上的差異。例如中國，目前的「這種」狀况，或不能說是很好的産生偉大作品的適當條件。丨雖是這樣，那條件的存在，却是無可置疑的事實。時代在要求偉大作品的産生。它已提供了偉大作品所需要的種種東西，而翹首等望着。但它也散佈了很多的困難和障碍。丨這只有由文學開拓者努力和奮鬥，而得以解决。這也卽是：文學開拓者盡了他對於時代的任務。</p>
<p>總之，今代要求着它的文學創作者，不能不刻苦地生活和不能不刻苦地寫作！過去的時代没有過像今日的偉大和豐饒：過去也没有過這樣的時代，在動向中授予創作者以寫作的能力，和苛刻地懇切地要求他産生出偉大的作品來！</p>

<h3>文藝雜筆</h3>
<p>— 再靑</p>
<p>「黃葉」入詩，最饒意象，作「黃葉小談」以後，我又看到了不少。如吳少芸的「白蓮憔悴人尋社，黃葉蕭條鵲噪村」，「秋聲黃葉裏，山影暮烟中」以及「竹光如海碧雲停，遠寺鐘聲幾度聽。行盡招堤黃葉路，隔江山色到門靑」（靈隱全韜光），都可以說是難得的佳句。近看哀宏道詩，亦時用「黃葉」，但佳句不多。不過，看他的「辟將黃葉止兒啼」，却想起「黃葉」在佛書裏也偶而採用，但意義是不同的。吳麟徵與其伯父生白畫云：「又聞伯父片紙不入都門，此晚節所雖當。今要津飽厭梁肉，區區黃葉，未足止兒啼，何如並省之以安淸白，伯父意或謂此邪」？其意與袁詩正同，是以「黃葉」作爲不能使人满足的事物的隱喻。「黃葉」爲什麽這樣的引起詩人的興味呢？張大　曾經作如此想：</p>
<p>秋葉純黃者上，班衣次之，水紅又次之，卉之品　，　麗於此。乃其憔悴之神，多在爛熳之際。其紅鮮，以悴徵縮；其綠膩，而紫暗：其黃特韻，然無綠。離落之致殆盡，而　華不在，豈　家所謂色嫩者耶？老　麗霜，不安寗也。夏初乞之朗僧，甚早，不堪其憂；今盛弊榮，致足撫掌。持螯拍浮之甜，十餘日，豈顧問哉！</p>
<p>此則見「筆談」第八卷，可見其對於「黃葉」的理解，較之李君　輩，是深入一些的。「黃葉」所以爲舊詩人珍視，確是由於這裏所說的「無餘」和「殆盡」。一種生命絶滅的象徵，一種肅殺秋聲中的哀歌，最足以襲擊多愁善感的詩人。至於並不帶着傷感眼去看「黃葉」的，大槪不在秋季，或者祇可用「缺陷美」作爲說明。「黃葉」，根本上就不是一種健康的表徵。「小步閒吟，意都不忍」，感傷的詩人，其心懷是大抵如此的。</p>
<h3>小說的描寫與内容</h3>
<p>— 丁一山</p>
<p>說大體，不說枝節：看主流，不看支流。</p>
<p>小說是一種描寫的表現的社會科學性的讀物：牠所寫的對象是人，牠描寫「人」爲個體生存及生殖（或種族延續）而努力而活動的諸現象，牠描寫人與自然界，社會，及個人的關係，這些關係的表現或是暗示，或是模仿，或是衝突，或是合作，或是爭鬥，或是妥恊，或是克服，或是投降，或他種性質類似的。這此關係的起因或動機是人的人在的必满足的慾望（Ｄesires），而結果或是悲或是喜，或二者羼雜而有。小說和别種描寫的社會科學（如歷史地理）相異處是：别的皆訴諸我們理性的了解，而小說却訴諸我們理性的了解與情感的欣賞二者。</p>
<p>小說不僅是一種欣賞的藝術，牠同樣地是一種知識。牠所描寫的以及要使我們明白的是人在大自然體系中相對位，團體及個人在社會中相對的地位，人類活動的動機，以及這些活動與自然界，社會，及生物環境的諸關係。牠們具體的及不可見的歷程，心理狀况，以及牠們的實在的和可能的結果。小說可以是人類行爲斷切面的現象的描寫，但更多的時候是有系統性的描寫。牠含有一種曆史性，且許可相當限度的想像。牠描寫過去，也描寫將來。牠描寫已經是的和現在是的（Ｗnat　it　was＆Ｗhat　it　is）較多，而描寫將要是的和應該是的（Ｗhat　it　will　be　and　Ｗhat　it　oughtto　be）較少，因爲讀者可以根據過去的及現在的去推想將來，而預言式的小說是不十分合理的。</p>
<p>小說不告訴我們學說與原理，像其他描寫的社會科學那樣，但牠可以暗示地或隱約地採用學說與原理使所描寫的現象更淸楚，讓讀者自己去體會發現。牠的客觀的範圍是人和自然的及社會的及生物的諸環境的關係，因此牠　描寫包括自然風景，城市與鄉村，制度與體系，個人行爲及其特性，心理狀况，以及人在各方面活動的悲的或喜的結果。許多小說是描寫人與社會環境（偏重制度方面）及生物環境（偏重人的方面）的關係的。例如描寫海邊漁民及陸地農民，則必寫到人與自然界的鬥爭，如對風雨旱蟲災害等。中國的水災旱災最足表現農人與自然界的爭鬥及關係，雖然到現在還没有用這類材料寫成的好著作問世，我們仍然可以明白這道理。寒帶人與地理環境及荷蘭人與水爭鬥的現象尤足顯出人與自然界的關係。小說的描寫，在方法外，態度上並不與别的描寫的社會科學（如史地）大異。如小說中的地方色彩，便是表示小說含有地理性。</p>
<p>至於方法，小說是用事實的描寫使我們認識大自然，社會，及人性，有時牠也試作解釋，但和歷史，地理，社會學所做的不同；後者全是客觀的叙述與解釋，而小說却含有不悖實情的合理的想像，因爲小說中當然地包括藝術成份，而藝術成份是使化裝過的事實對於讀者能生更大的效果。有許多小說做成了電影，這使我們更明白小是某時某地一種生活的描寫，生活的方面不限定，範圍的大小也不限定。拿歷史，地理，及社會學來對比着看，由小說編成的電影更幫助我們明瞭小說是一種訴諸我們情感與理智的。事實上，人事是有奇特異常的，有如統計學上曲綫圖的兩端的事例，而個人所有的經騐，智識，見解是有限的，有時我們看了小說中所寫的人事奇特處，有時超過，有時不及，眞正的奇特的人事，便不該以個人純粹主觀去看。除了社會學中案例研究法（Ｃase　study）與小說有相似處外，其他社會科學皆作槪括的叙述與研究，是抽象的，槪念的：小說的描寫則是具體的，現實的，接近我們的生活。因爲如此，所以小說是最能表現人的各種立塲及心理而最爲我們注意與歡迎的。</p>
<h3>明天（二十）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吴向隅譯</p>
<p>他們倆立在那兒好像啞子似的。老頭子在窗口心緒不寗與對他自己喃喃自語。突然他刺耳的喊出：「貝珊，我看見你。我要告訴哈利。」</p>
<p>她動了一動，像要跑開的樣子，但又停下來，舉起她的兩手放在兩邊的面頰上。小海格波特影子很糢糊與很大，一動也不動像一個銅人一樣。在他們的頭上，老人的聲音在那瘋狂的夜裏抖顫與責駡。</p>
<p>「趕開他，我的親受愛的。他只不過是一個流浪人。你所需要的是你自己的一個好的家庭。</p>
<p>那個傢伙没有家丨他不像哈利。他决不是哈利。哈利是明天回來。你聽見麽？再隔一天」，他咕嚕得更興奮了，「你不必怕丨哈利將要娶你。」</p>
<p>他的聲調發出來很尖銳與瘋狂，和外面海堤大風猛吹的嘯聲相呼應。</p>
<p>「他一定要娶你。我一定呌他這樣做，如果小，」丨他發了一個誓，我明天給他一先令呌他滾開，把我所有的東西都傳給你。我一定這樣做。傳給你。讓他去餓死。</p>
<p>窗門又乒乓地放下了。</p>
<p>哈利吸了一口深長的氣，向前一步走近貝珊。「原來是你丨就是那找定的女孩子，」他用低小的聲音說。她並没有移動，仍舊身體一半背着他，把頭壓在她的兩手的手掌中。「我老實講，」他接下去說，口角上帶了一絲看不見的笑。我有絶大的心願想停留下來······」</p>
<p>他的手臂抖得非常厲害。</p>
<p>「停留一星期，」他毫不思議地說。</p>
<p>她的兩手急遽地掩上她的面孔。</p>
<p>他走上來靠她很近，輕柔地握牢她的手腕。她感覺她的呼吸在一隻耳朶上。</p>
<p>「我是在困雖中丨就是這一次，丨也許只有你可以看得淸淸楚楚。他想把她的面孔撥開。她抵拒。於是她讓他去，退回一些，他問，「你有錢麽？我現在要走開了。」</p>
<p>她很快地忸怩地點頭，他等待着，眼睛看在别處，在别一方面，她混身戰抖，低了頭，去找她衣裳上面的一個袋子。</p>
<p>「錢在這兒，」她低聲說。「呀，去吧！爲上帝的原故，去吧！」如果我有再多一些丨再多一些丨我要都給你，使你忘記丨使你忘記一切。」</p>
<p>他伸出了他的手。「不是怕！我没有忘記世界上你們中間的一個。有些女子給我的不單是金錢丨但我現在是一個乞丐丨你們女人時常把我從困難中救出來。」</p>
<p>他昂然走近會客室的窗口，從窗門上溜出的暗黑的光亮中，看一看他手掌的錢幣。那是一枚半「先佛令」（等於半鎊）。他把它放進袋中。她側立在那兒，她的頭垂着，像受了傷似的，他的兩臂無力地垂在他的兩邊，像死了似的。</p>
<p>「你不能收買我，你也不能被人家收買。」他說。</p>
<p>他把他的帽子少許用力一按地戴好在頭上，過後，她覺得她已被他有力兩臂的擁抱所提起。她的兩脚已離開地面；她的頭仰起；他用着沉默而同時有力的熱情，像煞要很快地獲得她的靈魂似的，在她的面上傾注雨點般的吻。他吻她的蒼白的頰，她的堅硬的額，她的長的睫毛，她的暗淡的唇；漲潮的的韻節的起落和嘆息，隨着他的兩臂有力的擁抱，他克服一切的　憐而俱來。這正像着海，衝毁保護那鎭上的人家的堤防，送來一個浪花漫過她的頭上一般。這浪花過去了！她蹣跚地　回來，她的兩肩靠着牆，疲乏無力，正如在一個暴風雨與毁壞　隻後，在那地方擱了淺一樣。</p>
<p>她過了一會復睜開了眼；耳傾聽那堅定的整齊的帶着勝利的脚步聲走開，手開始聚攏她的衣　，眼總瞪視着她的前面。突然她疾馳到出開着的門走向黑暗中與荒凉的街上去。</p>

<h3>吹牛的機會</h3>
<p>— 馬</p>
<p>死爺，死娘，是吹牛的機會。因爲爺娘死了，於是乎而有訃聞，有哀啟，就在這個裏頭，吹牛的機會便是到了，他待爺待娘，怎樣地孝順，怎樣地服侍，而自己呢？怎樣能幹，怎樣偉大，便可借死人的口氣，來大吹一番，大擂一番，這是一個吹牛的絶好機會。</p>
<p>要人聞人死了，也是吹牛的一個機會，無論其人和某聞人，某要人，是否相識，或不相識，可以不問，便懇懇切切地做了一付輓聯，或者題辭之類，說死者對我怎樣的「深資倚畀」，怎樣地「推心致腹」，怎樣地「言聽計從」好在死者已死，無從起來證明。任你爛吹牛皮，傍人也無從知悉，這也是一個吹牛的絶好機會。</p>
<p>開會也是吹牛的機會，不過此處吹牛，還帶一些拍馬性質，一方面吹自己的牛，一方面還可送秋波到死者家屬去，原是一舉兩得的事，因爲死者已死，嘸啥拍頭，而其未死的家屬，則尙可拍也，於是拍之有餘味焉。此又是吹牛而兼拍馬之絶好機會也。</p>
<p>不過牛儘管吹，而第一個條件，便是要爺娘死，要人聞人死，死，則一死無對證」「死人肚裏自得知」便可隨意吹牛，就是傍人要笑掉牙齒，他也可不管。這種人我無話可說，只有深深地佩服他面皮眞厚，腦筋眞靈。從前我對於吹牛拍馬，曾作兩偈，茲錄如后，聯以奉贈。</p>
<p>吹牛偈</p>
<p>問道吹牛何物，其中妙趣無窮，任說經天緯地，原來色卽是空。</p>
<p>拍馬偈</p>
<p>拍馬儘多手段，祇有一語中庸，呼牛喚馬隨便，顔厚鐵甲十重。</p>
<h3>約翰劇社公演觀後</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>已是怱怱的快要一年了。</p>
<p>一年前、曾經和幾個同志想把約翰劇社組織起來，在聖誕節前來一次比較有意義的公演，可是終於因了客觀條件的種種限制和事實上的困難，組織約翰劇社的計劃終於成了泡影。</p>
<p>然而想不到在一年以後的今日，因了在校幾個同學的苦幹的精神，而終於把約翰劇社組織起來了，終於公演了，在很荒凉的乾枯的沙漠裏，能够莠出這麽一顆靑靑的嫩芽，我感到一陣莫名的欣慰。</p>
<p>導演是請孫瑜先生担任的，可是因爲孫瑜先生的工作繁忙，實際的責任是由黃嘉德先生負起的。</p>
<p>戲凡三齣：田漢的「名優之死」，陳秉權的「王八」和熊佛西的「劊子手」。</p>
<p>似乎用不着再在這裏討論到「名優之死」的劇本的本身上了，這裏把三幕改成了二幕，憑了幾個演員的努力，所得到的效果是足以自豪的。但是，飾楊大爺的秦復基演來稍微過火，有些文明戲化。汪津生飾的劉振聲稍嫌不够。至於藍業申和藍業慶飾的女角，後來雖很努力，但是男扮了女裝總覺得有點勉强，當因了他裝腔作勢而引起了台下的閧笑的時候，我不由地想起了「劊子手」裏劊子手妻的對話：「不要笑了，笑了使人怪難受的。」眞的，我心裏感覺到難受，同時，我感覺到一種恥辱和一種憤槪。朋友，别忘了藏在你們背後的一隻黑手哪！</p>
<p>第二齣是陳秉權自編自導自演的「王八」，除了他的演劇的天才是値得我們贊美以外，這一個純以少爺少奶間吃醋閙撇扭爲題材的劇本是不及「名優之死」和「劊子手」來得有意義的。然而，他的舉止也太嫌輕浮。</p>
<p>末一齣是「劊子手」，這在熊佛西過去的諸劇本中，是比較可取的一個。也許是舞台間太大了的緣故，這裏的布景太空洞，太單調。宗惟賡先生的燈光在這裏打得很好，飾「劊子手」的張世榮很認眞，朱文極飾收房租者稍嫌生疏，張訓禮很努力，而監業申所飾的劊子手妻比在「名優之死」裏更好了。</p>
<p>三齣戲所收的效果，比較是最末一齣獲得更多些。而霄雿樂團所奏的國樂，確乎能使人起一種悠然的懷古的情緒。</p>
<p>客觀的條件的制限和事實上的困難我却瞭解得很淸楚，然而這一次的公演竟能有這樣美满的成績，諸社員的努力苦幹的精神是確乎値得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>朋友，希望你們好好珍護着這顆生長在荒凉的乾枯的沙漠裏的嫩芽吧：我在這裏祝福着你們！</p>
<h3>學校生活漫寫之二——笑料</h3>
<h3>鬚</h3>
<p>— 千代子</p>
<p>從窗格中望到對過的高牆上，淡黃的冬日之影已經横斜在西邊，我直覺得已坐了整個下午了。手旁買司干的烟罐中，烟枝逐漸地少去，無聯耐的撫摩着自己的下頦，驚奇着鬚子硬得刺手。這是個新的發現，終於像期待着半天的大事般的從寫字檯抽屜中找尋出那破碎的鏡子來。</p>
<p>一個不完整的面影在鏡中顯露了，我以爲背後站立着另外一個人，但是這孤獨的小樓中，除了孤獨的主人以外，那蜷伏在門邊的「哈兒」牠能保證從没有見過一個生客；不過還是不信任似的旋過頭來瞥了一眼，牆壁上掛着一張二十四寸的放大像片，那决不是鏡中的人影。</p>
<p>彷佛荒漠一般的心境，這時候無端騷擾起來，站起身，摔摔烟捲，在一堆蒙蒙灰積的書籍中搜尋出一張自己的像片。雖然是記不起那一年的事情了，但淸楚地記着是和那張二十四寸放大像片是同一天攝的；她不是一般的年靑嗎？怎的，鏡中的人影變了樣呢？</p>
<p>重坐下來，對牆的陽光不知什麽時候悄悄的走了丨我已經計算過幾千百回，她是悄悄地來，悄悄地去的；也曾想追尋她的踪跡，可是到那裏去追尋呢？這問題就纒繞着我到現在。不，現在應該暫時抛棄牠，待我來詳細地比較這兩個不同的影和像。</p>
<p>這眞是個奇蹟，在任何部份都不見有絲毫雷同的地方，那就不能錯怪我以爲背後另外站着一個人了。在一個問題尙未解决的時候，我又被第二個問題纒住了；於是竭力自己解釋，這兩者之中，總有一個是我自己。我先拿鏡子來試騐，照到牆壁上，是二十四寸放大的像片，照到門角，是「哈兒」的倦態，照我的衣服，是那襲破舊的棉袍，這鏡子</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>雖已破碎了，還是和從前一樣，在主人面前照出一張美的的面影那般準確；然則丨那像片一定錯誤了，我一查牠的背面，寫着一行小字，一九二九年春日攝於西子湖畔。這呌我怎麽辦呢，我淸楚地記得，一千九百二十九年春天到過杭州，那牆壁上二十四寸的放大像同是綠柳絲絲的背景，那可以斷定鏡中的人影是我，像片也是我，不由地舉起手來撫摩着下頦，那硬得刺手的鬚子呵，你能告訴我一九二九攝影的我到那裏去了，同時那二十四寸放大像片的主人到那裏去了？哼，就那樣悄悄地來，悄悄地去嗎！</p>
<p>「哈兒，你知道嗎，爲什麽呌起來呢？」</p>
<p>當牠堅起耳朶狂吠的時候，原來包飯作送夜飯來了。天色已經完全黑暗，自然那淡黃的冬日之影是無可追尋了，好罷，讓一切在黑暗中我將不見那二十四寸的放大像片，不見這兩個不同的像與影；可是硬得刺手的鬚子却還是撫摩着牠呢！舊的問題，新的問題，將永遠纒繞着我，卽便在黑暗中。</p>
<h3>瘋女</h3>
<p>— 毓炯</p>
<p>凛列的寒風，呼呼的刮着那吳淞海濱的幾隻帆船，茫茫的海水，被寒風不斷的吹打着起着有節奏的音韻，和滾滾不停的波浪，由於海風的撲得過大的緣故，波濤給冲到石子上去。我歡喜在那石子的路上走來走去：在課餘的時候，便操着手在石子路上來回的繞着圈子。雖然是寒冷的天氣，但，美麗的　　，究竟容易逗起人好逛的心理。這一天，晚飯之後，海濱正漲着一上一下的潮水，往日被舖满了靑草的一條岸旁的馬路，正掩埋得看不見那路的踪跡，夕陽西下，冬天也有着不少美麗的海景，無數的輪船，飄揚着各種不同的旗幟，有的放出嗚嗚的汽笛聲響，驚動了在海水中藏着的魚兒躍來跳去怪好看的。突如其來的，從我的前面走過，披着一條綠色圍巾，臉圓圓的一個少女，獨個子在路旁漫步着，我把視綫從海的中央移轉過來，注射到她的身上，我的心有些不安定起來，怎麽一個人若有所思似的在走，該不是想「自殺」吧？一種懷疑的思緒，在我下意議裏潛伏着而還没有說出口的時候，忽然來了一個熟識的飯館老闆，陳二麻子追逐着她的後面，用着很惡劣的態度，在她的脚後跟，一步一步的緊追着她的身子，像是在嚕囌什麽似的，我更加疑懼起來，莫不是想吊這女人的膀子麽？怎麽她會一聲不響的讓他這人追來咧？我開始抑制不住自己的好奇心，終於將這個熟識的飯館老板陳二麻子攔阻着問他爲什麽要這麽跟着這個女人？究竟她是誰呢？無限的焦愁，顯在她的臉上可以看得出在她心底深處，是蘊藏着多少心事啊！在我將陳二麻子攔住再追她這一刹那之間，她轉過頭來的時候，她的臉色已轉變成鬆懈的，而没有先前那般的急迫，由於陳二麻子的解釋少了他的飯賬及詳細述說她槪况之後，我才知道她是一個帶有神經性質的瘋女，而且這被稱爲瘋女的她，亦就是我同考進此校半年多的一個同學，平時因爲同學人數的過多，簡直就似乎毫不認識她一樣的，一直到這一天，我才知道她的底蘊。</p>
<p>從此我回到學校，倒常常聽到她的一些身世，和她在學校裏面的一些瘋後的行爲。據說她是三年前在四川的Ａ軍官手裏的第九姨太太，處在這種地步她常是受上面的八層泰山的高壓和任意的打駡，又兼Ａ軍官升了師長，而她終於被遺棄了！從此，經過了無數生涯的刺激，她的神經老早就有些不大淸楚了！在學校裏，她往往發出一些高聲的呌啼，和裝出一些惹人發笑的舉動。在這些時候，誰又眞能同情她飄零的身世呢？假使有人眞正的安慰起她來的時候，一顆顆的淚珠便從她的眼眶裏淌出來。我們知道她不是没有理性，没有感情，而她的理性和感情，是被惡劣的現實所朦蔽，所昏亂啊！</p>
<p>光陰眞像流水，自從日本的砲火轟壞了Ｃ大學之後，這瘋女的足跡，聽說是四處飄浪。然而，她那深沉的，婉轉的，夾着北風怒吼的哀號，有的時候，還在我的耳鼓旁邊縈繞着。</p>
<h3>新書當廢紙賣</h3>
<p>— 宋元</p>
<p>去年的書局，新書論斤賣，已經駭人聽聞；現在的書局，於報上封面廣告大登着「新書當廢紙賣」，不禁令人驚心動魄，嘆書業之不景氣一至於此，而感文化前途的黯澹無光了。</p>
<p>本來書籍便宜，是讀書人喜歡不過的事。在這農村經濟破産城市工業凋敝的時代，讀書人爲满足求智慾起見不得已買書，對於書籍的費用，等於生活的費用，書籍便宜，卽生活費用减少，新書當廢紙賣，是應該認爲這一現象對於讀書人，對於文化前途，都是很有利益的了。可是，我們要知道，書局是商人營利的機關，他們賣書目的在於賺錢，如今大登廣告，「新書當廢紙賣」，很明顯地告訴我們說，「没有人買書，不得了呀！」爲什麽没有人買書呢？簡單一句話就可以答覆：讀書人没有錢。讀書人對於書籍的費用，旣然是等於生活的費用，如今百業不景氣，讀書人生活都感困難。這種生活以外的買書費用，自然就採取减縮政策不管了。文化事業所頼以促進的，除報紙雜誌以外，只有新書：如今讀書人不買新書，以致「新書當廢紙賣」，文化前途實在令人杞憂。說不一定，將來各書局的新書，都當廢紙賣，而由紙烟店南貨店將新書一頁一頁地，拿去作包花生米和雜貨用了。</p>
<p>新書業以今年爲「雜誌年」，已經告訴我們說，新書的銷路不行，只有雜誌是生意經，如今某書局大登廣告「新書當廢紙賣」，新書的購買力不及雜誌的購買力，更爲明證。可是，在這號稱「雜誌年」的雜誌購買力，是不是比較以前增大了呢？這却也是値得注意的問題。據我所知道的，商務印書館的東方雜誌是老牌子，銷路最大，可是今年并不見得比較以前好。又文藝雜志如「現代」與「文學」也算銷路最大的刋物，可是今年也并不見得比去年好。「現代」雜誌且因書局的營業不振關係而停辦了。</p>
<p>社會是這樣的百業不景氣，國民經濟是這樣的一日比一日的破産崩潰，新書的購買力是這樣的一落千文，文化前途眞是不得了！</p>

<h3>幾位電影巨頭口中的女演員的基本資格（下）</h3>
<p>格雷菲士（ＤavidＷardＣrifilh）大導演，是不用介紹的了。無論是誰，他在已往二十五年之中，要是看過一二次電影的，没有不曉得格雷菲士的名子。幾個他所「發現」，而一手提拔起來的，是瑪麗璧克馥，島格拉斯范朋克，魯道爾夫范侖鐵諾，魯爾華爾許，范逹克（亦是一位名導演），里昂巴里穆亞，李却巴塞爾姆斯，康絲登塔美治，瑙瑪希拉等等。他亦是給雪爾維亞薛妮，克蒂黛考爾白，吉斯德莫禮斯等，第一次鏡頭試騐的人。他對於一個女子，要想厠身於現代的影界，所應具備的資格，最重要的是天才。他說：「從前在默片時代，一個女子，祇要有上得鏡頭的美貌，和做功的靈活，就可以做女演員了，但是現在，一切都已變更了。現在要在影界立足，比較從前有加倍的難。就是極不重要的部份，亦要給有經騐的人去做，因爲祇是人經騐的人，才知道怎樣背誦對白，而使影片成爲整個活的東西。所以一個没有經騐的女子，要在現在挿進電影界，事先一些籌備都没有，是極困難的。她應當預先練習着表演和對白，而最好練習的地方，就是在小戲班裏。在攝影塲中做一個臨時演員，或一個瑣碎角色，而希望一步一步上升，而成爲一個電影明星，那是永遠難以成功的。在現在的攝影塲中所需要的，是喉嚨工作。現在有聲電影中的女伶，没有再比漢倫海斯更好的了，但是她在加入影界之前，曾在戲劇界做過多少年。多少别的女優，在有聲電影界成名的，亦都是從戲劇界出身的，她們已經從舞台上先得到許多必具的經騐的」。</p>
<p>麗蓮泰許門（ＬilyanＴa　hman）未死之前，最後一個導演，就是吉士德歐斯康（ＣhesterＥrsking)。他在泰許門死後，稱讀她道：「她是最不意氣用事，最容易導演的女伶了，雖然她帶着很重的病，那種病她自己知道會斷送她的生命，而是我們所不知道的，但是她仍舊每天從上午九時，工作到下午五時。她並不要求什麽優異的待遇，她和别的演員，一同融洽合作，從頭到底，一絲不苟。她的死，全影城都爲之震悼」。歐斯康對於新進女演員的選擇問題說：「我第一個在她身上所尋求的條件，是她的外貌，就是攝影方面的外表。第二個條件，是她的神情。她如果有些個性的話，她談話時的神情，走路的神情，以及坐立的神情，都可以將她的個性顯露出來的。第三個條件，是她的能力。能力不是可以立即發現的，但是等到發現了之後，她拍演第二張片子的時候，那就要先加以考慮了。不過有一件事，凡是想加入影界的女子，所必須明白的，就是做女伶是要辛勤工作的。那些以爲做了女明星，就一世榮華不盡的人，是一定要失意的。一個人要是不能全身全心的去做，結果必定是慘敗。要成功，必須要多年的工作，那裏並没有什麽終南捷徑」。</p>
<p>亞塞爾霍金斯（ＡrtliurＨopkins）是一個舞台上的巨頭，他就是聘用了凱絲玲赫本，在柏里莫斯戲院扮演「驕矜與歧視」一齣戲的人。他對於選擇演員的方法，有如下的意見：「最重要的條件，當然是普遍的工作上的相宜，和與某一角色的特别適合，所謂適合者，係包括外貌，言談，知識，以及個性等等而言的。那是各種資格混合而成的，並不是指一個特點而說的。經騐是應當有的，但並不是必須的。新進的人才，在適當領導之下，可以進步得很快，如果她具備優伶的質地的話。在排戲的時候，總是先將重要角色布置好了之後，才去尋覓次等角色的。有的時候，你祇要讀了脚本，就早已成竹在胸，某人飾某角，某人飾某角，不必多事尋求了」。</p>
<p>還有一位埃第道林（ＥddieＤowling）他是名伶，製作家，而兼導演的人。他現在正導演着一張歌舞諷刺片。他說：「我第一樣尋求的是天才。没有天才的人，是於我們絶對無用的。但是天才不是一看就看得出來的。譬如這裏一一屋子的新進的人，都是你不認識的，你所能做到的，僅是檢幾個個性出衆的人，或是態度特别超越的人。美麗固然是重要的，但是比較天才，就要次一級了。許多大明星，並不是十分美麗的。一個有八九分姿色的人而具有天才，比之具有十分美貌而天才平庸的人，要好得多了」。從以上所說的，你們可以得到一個大約可靠的結論；就是：「美麗，尤其是容色美，是很有用塲的，但是並不是十二分必須的。你一定要具有其他别的條件才興」！（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「焚屍案」</h3>
<p>— 石斧</p>
<p>Ｍurder　on　Ｔhe</p>
<p>Blackboard丨南京映</p>
<p>連續地映了許多探案的影片，彷彿是着了福爾摩斯大偵探的迷一般，可是卽使有精彩的我們也應該看得膩煩了，何况這繼「鵝池慘案」之後，再來上這一部「焚屍案」呢？</p>
<p>這故事的單純，祇要看它一樣地跟着别人家的老調，把屍首弄得無影無踪，顯出奇之又奇，但可惜我們對於這種毁屍滅跡的老套，委實看得够了，何况這並非情理所有的事，所以在這一點上，劇本已失去了重心，加以導演的手腕平弱，我們一面看戲一而要替他在細細研究，不啻也做了一次偵探一樣，這是因爲全劇缺乏緊張的情緒，所以使你能從容運思於一面看戲之外，我以爲劇中主人翁，（女校長蕙絲EdnaＭayＯliver飾）的一種做作，未免過火。</p>
<p>關於舖叙方面，旣嫌零碎，而佈局方面，又那樣的呆板，地窖下幾個塲面的鏡頭地位，我們簡直看得迷了方向。當探長派拍剛去出一枝雪茄要燃火，第一個塲面緊接着又取第二支雪茄，我們很容易看出翦接的疏忽。對白方面的趣味也不算高級，結尾的一段有些狗尾續貂之嫌。</p>
<p>至於說到本題譯意「黑板上的暗殺案」造意雖尙新奇，可是諸如毒藥，手槍，花瓶，女舄之類的東西，在偵探片中本不算希奇，何况在這裏不過是在黑板上寫的一個短樂譜中隱含着兇手的名字，這眞是非常笨拙了！</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>看了「百花洲」後</h3>
<p>— 武生</p>
<p>看了「百花洲」後，不禁使我替天一額首稱慶，眞的，「百花洲」在劇本的意識上講，是已超越了天一過去的許多片子而較「紅樓春深」，「春宵曲」等更有意義的了。</p>
<p>雖然，「百花洲」仍逃不了男女間的戀愛糾紛，但它却告訴了我們，戀愛是苦痛的，戀愛是葬送我們前程的惡魔，是騙取我們靑春的仇敵，我們應該抛棄戀愛，爲國家社會努力，創造我們遠大的前程！</p>
<p>劇旨是着這樣的意義，但因劇作者不能正確的去理解現實，以及導演的技術軟弱無力，不免破壞了全劇的力量，這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>演員中以陳玉梅的周雲香，葉秋心的李桂芳，比較努力，李英亦佳，但有些過火。</p>
<p>攝影，佈景均尙佳，惜字幕多了些。</p>
<p>總之，「百花洲」該是天一公司比較過去成功而値得一看的作品。</p>

<h3>「上海廿四小時」觀後</h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>我們在這裏所看到的，乃是上海黑暗的片斷，畫面已經失去了它的連貫性，處處地方都顯出了生硬和不自然。當然，我們應該原諒導演是爲了環境的關係，並不是他的過失呀！</p>
<p>然而，這張片子依舊有其可取之處，至少，牠的内容，我們可以看出牠完全是眞實的抒寫，不架空，不虚渺，最成功的地方，我以爲要算幾個對比了，例如他一面寫一個童子重傷得快要死了，但是他没有錢請醫生醫治；而又一方面寫到一個買辦的太太，却付了二十兩銀子的賬給獸醫院，這種人不如獸的對比，是何等的深刻動人而有力量！惟有眞實的抒寫，才能打動人們的心坎，我以爲。</p>
<p>畫面雖失了連貫性，但是每一個獨的畫面，却仍然是很好的，例如：開頭的畫面和結尾的畫面所映出的上海街景，是多麽的淸晰美麗！</p>
<p>導演雖聞有疏忽之處，但大體說來，那使人满意，有不少的地方，我們正可以看出他處理這個故事的愼重。不過這裏他似乎只注重幾個主角，而忽略了其餘的演員，以致全片情節，有點不大調和，如胡雯龍直可以說毫無表情。此外如跑狗塲舞塲中的臨時演員，亦嫌太呆板了。</p>

<h3>金蓮刧（Have　Heart）(四）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>吉梅在汽車裏，告訴莎麗說，他不久就要得到像這輛汽車一樣的車了一輛。他說：「現在替你開車的，你知道是誰？他已是一個大人物，右姆斯法拉赫德丨地方經理。」莎麗深黑色的眼睛，不覺睜得很大的，透出歡悅的光彩。她低聲喊道：「哦，吉梅，你升了嗎？」吉梅點着頭道：「是的。許多人之中，祇有我一個人升任地方經理。」莎麗這個時候，一方面替吉梅高興，一方面替自己高興，能够和這位地方經理同車，她暫時忘記了她是個跛足的女郎。不過不久她的迷夢就驚醒了，因爲吉梅突然將車煞住了，對着莎麗道：「你知道這是什麽地方？羅斯蘭跳舞廳丨我們下來跳「會子。」莎麗被他一說，嚇了一大跳，一切的快樂。都烟消雲散了。她旣不能進跳舞廳，亦不能告訴他是什麽理由。她一方面說不出，一方面坐着不動，儘着吉梅去催。後來她忽然想到一個計策，推却了他跳舞的請求，而吉梅亦似乎很满意的，而不堅持了。這樣一個晚上，很快樂地過去了。等到吉梅將莎麗送到家門口的時候，莎麗自己一個人下了車，就呌吉梅不要下來。她說她願意站着，看他將車了開走。但是吉梅不肯。他說：「我一定要送到你門裏。我有一個特别的理由。」莎麗不覺納罕道：「你有什麽特别的理由？」吉梅道：「我想，要是你眞的很快活，像你所說的一樣，或者你會讓我吻你一下子的。」他說着，帶着無限希望看着莎麗。莎麗躊躇了一回，然後說道：「難道你和人家接吻，一定要在門裏的嗎？」吉梅聽了，立時將莎麗抱在懷裏，呌了一聲：「安琪兒，」和她吻着。莎麗被他一吻，吻得她满心歡喜　　，一回，他將吉梅推開了道：「好了，你去嗎。我就站在這裏和你擺擺手吧。」吉梅　　　　不捨地看着她道：「好，安琪兒，我明天來看你。」他說着就跳進了車子，開着走了。</p>
<p>吉梅走了之後，直等到他回到公司，去放好車子的時候，才發現莎麗的一隻狗，還在他的車子裏。他跳下了車子，那隻狗亦跟着跳了下來。它開始汪汪地呌起來了。吉梅連忙喝阻，但是已經來不及了。看夜的巡捕已經聽見了，而走過來了。吉梅連忙抱了那隻狗，向公司裏奔了進去。他在過道裏奔着，躱進了一間大廳旁邊的小屋子，那間小屋子，正對着購房間的門。說時遲，那時快，那個看夜巡捕已經追了進來。他剛走到賬房間的門口，突然間一個人，剛從賬房裏倫錢出來，他走到看夜巡捕的身後，將一個東西打在他的頭上。那個看夜巡捕立即倒下去了。這個時候，吉梅的手一鬆，那只狗立即竄了下去。它追着那個强盜。那個强盜看見狗上來，一脚就將它踢開了。吉梅連忙從小屋子裏走了出來，走過了大廳，想去引那隻狗進來。這時那隻狗狂嘷了一聲，從另外一間屋子裏直飛出來，確是被那個强盜踢出來的。吉梅連忙將它抱住了，躱到桌子底下去。他一些不作聲的四面看着。一回兒，他看見一隻手，從那屋子裏伸了出來，去擰電燈的開關。那個人將電燈擰滅了丨就逃出去了。在那人。</p>
<p>伸手去擰開關的時候，吉梅看見他的手臂上刺着花紋，是一個銀元的樣子。吉梅等到强盜逃走之後，他亦就立即帶了莎麗的狗，逃了出來。（未完）</p>

<h3>Qu Fangpu Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visits Wang and Sun to Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee Member and Guangdong Finance Department Director Qu Fangpu, along with Yang Dezhao, Section Chief He Shaoqiong, Wen Zhongqi of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and Liu Peiquan of the Guangdong Aviation Committee, arrived in Nanjing on the 18th and stayed at the Central Hotel. At 10:00 AM, he visited He Yingqin, at 11:00 AM, he visited Sun Ke, and at 3:00 PM, he visited President Wang at the Railway Department official residence. Wang immediately hosted a banquet for Qu, Wen Zhongqi, He Shaoqiong, and others on the evening of the 18th, inviting President Sun and Yang Dezhao to accompany. Sun scheduled a banquet for Qu and others on the evening of the 19th. According to He Shaoqiong, Qu's visit includes a personal letter from Director Chen Jitang to President Wang. In addition to reporting on the bandit suppression situation, the main task is to report on the economic situation of Guangdong Province. The current income and expenditure of the Guangdong Finance Department is short by about 10 million yuan annually. In recent years, efforts have been devoted to construction expenses, reaching more than 10 million, so the financial situation is increasingly difficult. As for requesting central government subsidies, due to the central government's own financial difficulties, no solutions have yet been discussed. He plans to stay in Nanjing for about three or four days before returning to Guangdong. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qu Fangpu, accompanied by Yang Dezhao, and Wen Zhongqi, He Shaoqiong arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 18th. According to him, he originally intended to attend the Fifth Plenary Session and report to Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Minister Kong, and the central authorities on the recent financial situation in Guangdong Province, the progress of the bandit suppression work in the Southern Route, and request instructions on the future bandit suppression policy. However, due to unfinished business in Guangdong, he was unable to attend. After arriving in Shanghai, he met with Kong and Song, and reported separately on the financial and construction situation in Guangdong Province. His visit to Nanjing is to pay respects to Chairman Lin, President Wang, and the central authorities, to report on everything, and to request instructions from Chiang on the location of the visit. He will go to see Chiang after receiving a reply. He will report on the progress of the bandit suppression work in the Southern Route and request instructions on future policies. He emphasized that his visit to Nanjing is purely to report to the authorities and has no other tasks. After visiting the various authorities, he will return south. As for the bandit suppression work in Guangdong Province, there are currently no traces of bandits on the border between Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi. The remnants of bandits fleeing west have also been strictly blocked. Chen Jitang has also prepared a plan to dispatch elite troops to suppress them and has submitted it to Chairman Chiang for review. When he was in Hong Kong, he met with Mr. Hu, but due to the short time, they did not talk much, so it is not known when Hu will come north. He did not have time to meet with Wang Liangchou. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qu Fangpu, accompanied by Yang Dezhao, visited He Yingqin and Presidents Wang and Sun at around 10:00 AM on the 18th to report on everything. A banquet was held for Qu at Wang's Railway Department official residence at 7:00 PM on the 18th, with Yang Dezhao and others accompanying. (Central Social News of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qu Fangpu said that the date and location of the meeting with Chairman Chiang has been telegraphed to Fenghua by Yang Dezhao for instructions. If Chiang's arrival in Nanjing is not fixed, then he and others will go to Zhejiang within a few days, otherwise they will stay in Nanjing to wait temporarily. After Guangdong Province abolished excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the income and expenditure for the second half of this year is short by 4 to 5 million yuan, that is, a monthly shortage of tens of thousands of yuan, and we still hope that the central government will provide appropriate subsidies. When he met with Finance Minister Kong in Shanghai, he mentioned this opinion. He brought two types of documents with him, the Guangzhou Three-Year Construction Plan and the Provincial Statistical Monthly, to present to the central government and distribute to all parties, so that they can understand the situation in Guangdong.

<p>(Taiyuan) After the death of Yan's father, it is scheduled to hold a memorial service tomorrow according to custom, marking the third seven-day period. Yesterday, he telegraphed the central government agencies to sincerely resign from all his concurrent positions, so as to observe mourning at home. Chiang and Wang have both sent telegrams of condolence. The entire provincial government of Shanxi, the provincial committee, and all parties have also sent telegrams of condolence. Zhao Pilian telegraphed Yan from Nanjing, immediately returning to Shanxi to offer condolences in person. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan Xishan sent a special telegram to the Central Executive Committee, the National Government Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission on the 17th due to his father's death, saying that he had been unfilial and that his late father had passed away due to illness on the 17th. He said that he had spent most of his 20 years serving the country and very little time attending to his parents. He was deeply saddened by the sudden tragedy and deeply believed that although his body could still serve the country, there would be no more days to serve his parents. He pleaded for consideration and approval to resign from all his concurrent positions, so as to observe mourning at home and atone for his previous faults. He urgently presented his request, hoping for understanding. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Water Conservancy Expert Nie Yufu Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Makes Preparations for Departure and Inspection</p>
<p>(Nanjing) League of Nations water conservancy expert Nie Yufu and his wife arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. The Water Conservancy Department of the Economic Commission sent staff to receive them and they temporarily rested at the League of Nations Expert Office in Gaoloumen. At 4:00 PM, he and his secretary, Sima, went to the Economic Commission to meet with Secretary-General Qin Fen to discuss the situation of departing and inspecting various water conservancy projects. As a result, Mr. Nie was not very familiar with the organization and engineering of China's water conservancy agencies and the historical evolution of various rivers. It was decided that he would first conduct a considerable amount of research with the Water Conservancy Department of the Economic Commission in Nanjing, and then set off north for inspection. The original departure date of the 20th was changed to the end of the month. Tan Zhen and Zhang Jiong of the Water Conservancy Department will accompany him on the trip. The inspection period is from the end of this month to the end of March next year, and the locations are the same as those of Wo Motu, who has already departed. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nie Yuren, the water conservancy expert from the League of Nations to China, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 18th. In the afternoon, he visited Qin Fen to discuss the inspection of water conservancy projects in various places. Nie was originally scheduled to go north on the 20th to inspect projects such as the Yongding River and the Hai River. Because it was his first time in China, he did not fully understand the implementation of water conservancy in China and the plans. After contacting the Economic Commission, he is expected to leave Beijing and go north at the end of the month. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Said Before Leaving Hong Kong that the Results of this Trip Were Satisfactory</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Chonghui said on the 18th, "My efforts in running between Nanjing and Guangdong are not only coming to an end, but are also very close to success. Judging from recent facts, the postponement of the Fifth Plenary Session and the cooperation in bandit suppression are both good signs of practical cooperation." Wang boarded the President Cleveland liner in the evening and will set sail for Shanghai on the morning of the 19th. Wang also said, "I have not heard of Sun going south again, and Hu's whereabouts are also uncertain." (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Chonghui and Sun Danlin left Hong Kong on the President Cleveland liner at 12:00 PM on the 18th and went to Shanghai. Many people, including Cheng Tiangu, came to the port to see them off. Hu Mulan also rushed over from the province to see them off. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Chonghui is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the President Cleveland liner at 12:00 PM on the 18th and return north. Before leaving, he hosted a reception for the Hong Kong press at the Gloucester Hotel at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and made a statement, saying that after returning to China and traveling north and south, he was extremely gratified to see that comrades from all sides had a unanimous opinion on sincere unity. The results of this trip south with Sun Zhesheng were particularly satisfactory. Now that everything in Hong Kong is over, he decided to return north tonight and visit friends in Beijing and Shanghai to bid farewell, because the holiday of the Hague Tribunal is about to end and he will have to go abroad to resume his post in early January.

When discussing issues such as the organization of the city government and the compensation of city councilors, the committee members debated fiercely. As a result, the city government will still have six bureaus: Social Security, Public Security, Finance, Public Works, Education, and Health. Land Administration, Public Utilities, and Port Affairs bureaus may be added if necessary. If there are special local circumstances, the six bureaus may also be merged. However, city governments with bureaus are limited to the capital and cities with a population of over one million. The rest are based on the principle of setting up sections. As for the draft of the city councilors' compensation, the original plan was for unpaid positions, which would be tantamount to restricting workers from running for election. In the future, the number of city councilors will inevitably be monopolized by the wealthy, so it is advocated that city councilors should be given allowances during the meeting period, so that the general working class will not have to worry about going into public service hungry when they are elected. As a result, the entire meeting unanimously approved the passage. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to meet at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss matters. (8) The Legal System Committee of the Yuan, together with the Autonomy Law Committee, reported on drafting the draft Implementation Law of the City Autonomy Law. Resolved: The second reading was amended and passed according to the draft, and Huang Youchang and others were instructed to reorganize the text and submit it to the meeting for discussion. Then, the draft amendment to the Civil Procedure Law was reviewed. First, Luo Ding reported on the amendment process, stating briefly that since the central government decided that the court should adopt a three-level, three-trial system, it was necessary to amend the Civil and Criminal Procedure Laws. The main points of the civil procedure amendment are nothing more than expanding the scope of provisional execution, limiting the amount of benefit in appeal cases, and concentrating debates. The purpose of the amendment is to make the litigation process more convenient and to quickly resolve disputes between the two parties. Two-thirds of the articles in the amendment are the original articles of the current law, and the rest are newly amended this time. After Luo finished speaking, the discussion began. The first part, 243 articles, was passed the second reading in full according to the amendment, and it was decided to continue the discussion on the afternoon of the 19th.

<h3>Jixian Residents Resist Taxes</h3>
<p>Two Village Chiefs are Arrested as a Result</p>
<p>The Poor People's Party Surrounds the County Government</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It has recently been discovered in Jixian that the Poor People's Party is entering and leaving various villages every day. There are often meetings with many people, and there are also communist speakers, which is very intense. Communist propaganda is often found in the villages. The county chiefs of Zunhua and Jixian have jointly taken action to suppress them. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Several months ago, there was an organization of the Poor People's Association in Jixian, with more than 300 participants, under the pretext of requesting the abolition of excessive taxes and implementing tax resistance. When Wu Minghao was the county chief of Jixian, he had taken action to suppress them. Recently, the association has resumed tax resistance. County Chief Wang Xinggong advised them that their actions were inappropriate, but to no avail. The day before yesterday, he arrested two village chiefs and detained them in the county jail. The Poor People's Association then gathered more than a hundred people and went to the county government to surround it and petition. It was unresolved until late at night. Wang Xinggong has telegraphed the Ji-Mi Public Security Office to request instructions. It is reported that the members of the Poor People's Association are extremely complex, including traitors, communists, and hooligans. It has been decided to strictly deal with them to ensure local peace. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>A Rehe Golden Buddha Appears in a New York Museum</h3>
<p>(Beiping) China originally had three gilded Buddhist statues, one stored in Beiping, one in Mount Wutai, and one in the Potala Temple in Rehe. The gilded Buddhist statue stored in Rehe was three zhang tall and about one zhang wide, with exquisite carvings and unparalleled beauty. In March of last year, one month before the fall of Rehe, it was stolen by an official of Rehe Province and brought to Beiping, where it was sold to a merchant of antiques in Shanghai for 10,000 yuan. The official then regretted that the selling price was too low and recovered it at the original price, secretly transported it to Shenyang, and stored it in a private residence of a chairman. Later, it was mortgaged to a church in Nanguan, Shenyang. In the winter of last year, an American antique dealer bought it for 540,000 silver dollars and transported it to the United States. The gilded Buddhist statue is now on display in a New York museum. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>Zhu Shiqin Returns to Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the War Zone Reorganization Committee sent Zhu Shiqin to mediate the dispute between the Yutian Security Team and the local militia, the leaders of both sides have expressed their willingness to obey orders and earnestly reorganize. The dispute can be said to have come to an end. Zhu returned to Beiping last night because the incident had a solution. This morning, he visited Huang to request detailed instructions. He will still go to Yutian in three or four days. Zhu said that the details of the dispute between the local militia in Yutian will be announced by the War Zone Reorganization Committee. On this trip to Yutian, he first went to Tangshan and transferred to Fengrun, where he stayed overnight. He went to Yutian the next day. After arriving there, the situation was still quite serious. Except for Erjia Tofu Workshop, all the shops in the city were closed. After he mediated and lectured to the relevant parties, six shops reopened the next day, and most of them resumed normal business on the third day, and the situation eased. The telegrams and telephones between Beiping and Yutian are also open as usual. Because the incident has come to an end, it is necessary to request detailed instructions on the follow-up matters from Zi Huang, so he rushed back to visit them separately. When he passed through Tianjin last night, he had already visited Yu Shang and Chen all the details. After arriving in Beiping, he visited Huang again this morning to request instructions. He will still go to Yutian in three or four days. (Special dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) After Bei Hai, the customs officer of Qinhuangdao Customs, was wounded when he inspected the Japanese steamship Lunhu at Shihekou on the 10th, Bei Hai has not sailed overseas all the time, and the steamship has been remotely monitored. Because the steamship heard that the incident had expanded, after unloading the goods, the crew went ashore at night, and on the night of the heavy fog, the ship was burned to destroy the evidence. After Agerd, the customs commissioner of Qinhuangdao Customs, met with Yiga in Beiping, he returned to Qinhuangdao on the 17th. This matter will quietly await the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' negotiation. After the Japanese ship of smuggled goods caused trouble at Shihekou, the Japanese side knew that they were in the wrong, and Yiga has notified the Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner to wait for someone to investigate the truth before discussing it further.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Monetary System</h3>
<p>Su</p>
<p>In recent months, the issue of reorganizing China's monetary system has once again drawn serious attention from various public and private sectors within the country. Taking the government's perspective, the establishment of the Currency System Research Committee is an example of something already put into practice. However, it is still difficult to say to what extent the national currency system reorganization will be realized in the future. It is hoped that the government authorities can take a broad and long-term view to ensure the thorough implementation of the reorganization plan.</p>
<p>The unification of the monetary system is originally a reflection of a strong national power. This is true for all modern advanced countries. Conversely, under today's international relations, the economic development of relatively backward countries has not yet reached its full potential. Therefore, their currency systems, which arise as a consequence, cannot be as sound as those of advanced countries. In other words, the extremely chaotic state of China's past currency system is related to the weakness of its people's economic strength. Now, if we want to reorganize the old system and unify it to facilitate the circulation of wealth, the fundamental solution is to gather the strength of all the people and develop industries. Only then can a sound monetary system be established and maintained permanently.</p>
<p>However, this matter is of great importance, and the complexities are numerous and there are many obstacles. However, there are few shortcuts to be found. For decades, there have been many great works and brilliant arguments about monetary system reform. Even the arguments of foreign advisors such as Mr. Jingqi and the proposals of Mr. Ganweier have considerable value for attention. However, the currency system, which is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, has never been reformed as a result. Where is the reason for this? It is still due to the backwardness of the national economy and the complexity of the international situation. Even with full enthusiasm to reform and unify the monetary system, it is still difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>In view of the past failures in reorganizing the monetary system, we deeply hope that we can avoid repeating this mistake in the future. However, this is a difficult task. For now, within the scope of addressing the symptoms, can we speak to those responsible for reorganizing the monetary system about one thing that is easier to start with and should be paid attention to?</p>
<p>The current state of currency circulation in our country is rare in the world. Hard coins are one thing. As for paper money, within the concession areas, there are not only banknotes from various domestic banks, but also occasional exchange coupons from foreign banks. As for their reserves, they are often unknown to the local people. In addition, in various places in the interior, some private shops even issue money tickets or value coupons similar to paper money. As a result, the types of paper money in the country are becoming increasingly complex. Although our country is known as a silver standard country, the issuance of paper money cannot be concentrated in one institution, and the cash reserves for paper money are also in a dispersed state. The silver belonging to major issuing banks accounts for only a small portion of the country, and the amount belonging to government agencies is even smaller. Once we want to concentrate the issuance of paper money and cash reserves in fact under this situation, we will feel great difficulty. This is what should be started to be reorganized urgently. In the future, if our country can establish a fundamental reorganization plan in this regard, making the issuance unified and the reserves centralized, it may not be a bad thing to help reorganize the monetary system.</p>

<h3>English Newspapers Speak Unequivocally</h3>
<p>Russia and France Sign Military Alliance</p>
<p>Defensive in Nature, Five-Year Term</p>
<p>Japan and Germany as Ideal Enemies</p>
<p>Technological and Defense Cooperation, Mutual Assistance</p>
<p>(London) According to today's Star, the Franco-Russian military agreement was formally accepted on November 22nd by French Foreign Minister Laval and Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, representing their respective governments in Geneva. The report also states that the Franco-Russian trade agreement was also finally signed on December 10th. It is heard that the military agreement stipulates a five-year term, which can be extended for another five years with the consent of both parties. It also stipulates that aviation and military committees will be exchanged to assist each other. The French committee will go to Russia to investigate all Soviet Russian military efforts. The Russian committee will also go to France with the same purpose. The agreement will take effect immediately. The Soviet Union will build French-style aircraft engines under the guidance of French technicians. France will transport 400 light tanks to Russia for use in various places. The military staff departments of France and Russia will directly discuss everything via radio in code. Article 1 of the agreement states that this is purely defensive in nature, stipulating that the staff departments of the two countries exchange technical information to cooperate with each other. Article 2 points out that Japan and Germany are the most likely enemies. Articles 3 and 4 stipulate active cooperation in aviation. Article 5 states that if the Soviet Union is attacked by Japan, France will immediately supply the Soviet Union with war equipment without consultation, with a value not exceeding 400,000 francs. If France and Germany go to war, the Soviet Union must supply France with food of the same value. The agreement does not mention the dispatch of troops. The Star has learned that France and Russia will consider Poland's position at a later date. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Returns Instructions to London</h3>
<p>Naval Talks to Adjourn Tomorrow</p>
<p>Three Countries to Issue Joint Statement</p>
<p>No Date Set for Reopening</p>
<p>Japan to Announce Treaty Termination After Christmas</p>
<p>UK and Japan to Continue Consultations Through Diplomatic Channels</p>
<p>(London) Naval representatives from Britain, the United States, and Japan have recently agreed on a draft resolution to postpone naval negotiations and continue consultations through diplomatic channels. This draft resolution has been telegraphed to the governments in Tokyo and Washington for their review. Once approval is received, the resolution will be established, and the naval talks will come to an end. The draft resolution stipulates the following:</p>
<p>(1) It is beneficial for all parties participating in this negotiation to understand each other's opinions. (2) The naval negotiations are postponed. (3) It is advocated that naval negotiations be reopened in a short period of time. (4) The date for reopening negotiations and continuing consultations through diplomatic channels will be determined by the British government.</p>
<p>The last plenary session of the three countries' representatives is still scheduled to be held at the Foreign Office on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Simon and Overseas Territories Minister Thomas both convened representatives from various autonomous territories at the Overseas Territories Department this morning to report on the latest progress in the naval negotiations. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, when British Foreign Secretary Simon met with U.S. Representative Davis at the House of Commons, he handed over the British-proposed plan to suspend the naval talks among Britain, the United States, and Japan to Davis. It is heard that this plan does not stipulate the date for the resumption of talks, but suggests that if the British representative obtains new grounds for continuing the talks, he can reconvene the representatives for a meeting. It is also heard that the United States is likely to respond favorably to this plan in general. The British representative will send this plan to the Japanese representative tomorrow to seek their consent. In addition to Simon and Davis, British Foreign Office officials Craigie and American Embassy Counselor Houghton were also present at today's meeting. This is likely to be the last meeting between the main British and American representatives. Before the plenary session is held, all negotiations will be handled by secondary personnel. It is expected that the naval talks will adjourn this Thursday, and Japan will announce the termination of the Washington Naval Treaty on Friday or Saturday. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The document on the postponement of the naval talks, submitted by the British government to the U.S. representative, is extremely concise, only recording various viewpoints on the surface, and not exhausting the root cause of the difficulties that prevented the talks from producing a satisfactory result. As for the date of reopening the talks, since Britain is the initiator of the naval talks, it should be determined by Britain. Before reopening the talks, the British government can continue consultations through diplomatic channels. In fact, the British and Japanese governments have already consulted through diplomatic channels. The Japanese government has notified the British government of its naval shipbuilding program for 1935 to 1936. This shipbuilding program does not fall outside the scope of the Washington Naval Treaty. (Note: After the Washington Naval Treaty is declared terminated, its validity period will still last until the end of 1936.) The British side believes that it is satisfactory. However, what Britain wants to understand is what kind of plans Japan has for the 1936 to 1937 shipbuilding program. The answer from the Japanese side is currently awaited. However, it is expected that Vice Admiral Yamamoto will definitely reply that the shipbuilding plan for 1936 to 1937 has not yet been determined and cannot be informed. From this, it can be seen that Britain has engaged in diplomatic negotiations with Japan, just as it is engaging in diplomatic negotiations with other naval powers. In addition, the Tokyo government may request the continuation of naval talks in London. However, this is only a gesture of goodwill. Japan's viewpoint has not changed, so the three-country talks cannot continue because of Japan's request. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Tokyo's Return Instructions</h3>
<p>Fundamental Principles Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the Foreign and Navy Ministries receiving the telegram requesting instructions from the Japanese representative and consulting on countermeasures, it was decided to maintain the fundamental policy, and return instructions will be issued early tomorrow morning. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's fundamental policy on disarmament will definitely not change. (2) Japan is prepared to accept the proposal for adjournment from Britain and the United States, but it is necessary to determine the date for reopening. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The London preparatory conference will convene a three-country roundtable meeting at 4 p.m. on the 19th to adopt a joint declaration on the adjournment, and then temporarily close. The contents of the above-mentioned declaration were requested by Ambassador Matsudaira from Foreign Minister Hirota on the 18th, including a clause stipulating that the meeting will be reconvened at a time deemed appropriate by the United Kingdom. The Japanese government originally hoped to specify the reopening date, but considering the position of the inviting party, the United Kingdom, even if it is stated again, the hope is only that. Therefore, the ending is still to recognize that the preparatory conference will be reconvened at a time deemed appropriate by the United Kingdom. There seems to be no objection to this, so this intention has been issued as an instruction on the night of the 18th, telegraphed to Ambassador Matsudaira in the United Kingdom. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has issued instructions to Ambassador Matsudaira regarding the adjournment declaration. In addition, there is the issue of so-called instructions on a draft compromise between Japan and the United Kingdom. It is now heard that these instructions still need to be delayed for a day or two. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Meets the King</h3>
<p>(London) Naval negotiations have now been decided to be postponed. Before the postponement is implemented, no suggestions have been seen from the Japanese side. According to custom, foreign representatives attending international conferences must meet with the monarch only when the work of the conference is completely over. Therefore, Japanese Chief Expert Committee Member Yamamoto and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira will be received by King George V at Buckingham Palace this afternoon. Yamamoto also issued a statement to the Havas News Agency, saying, "Some people have asked us whether Japan is prepared to notify other countries of Japan's shipbuilding program after the expiration of the Washington Naval Treaty when necessary, or whether Japan's shipbuilding program has not yet been determined. This question inevitably raises major difficulties." Yamamoto hosted a banquet at noon today to entertain experts from the British, American, and Japanese delegations. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Privy Council Approves Draft to Terminate Treaty</h3>
<p>Notice to Be Issued After Christmas</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is certain that the government's original plan to notify the termination of the Washington Naval Treaty will be approved at the Privy Council meeting on the 19th. The government has scheduled the final procedures to be decided at the cabinet meeting on the 21st. However, the date of issuing the notice will take time due to the arrangement of documents and other factors. Moreover, the US government and other countries are all on Christmas holiday, which is inconvenient. Therefore, the ending is that the issuance of the notice will be after Christmas on the 26th. (Domei, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 10 a.m. today, the Emperor personally opened the Privy Council's main meeting in the East Room of the Imperial Palace. The proposal to abandon the Washington Treaty was officially passed and handed over to the government on the same day. Therefore, the government convened a cabinet meeting, formally decided, and then requested the Emperor's approval. Then, Ambassador Saito in the United States notified the US State Department. The full text of the notice is as follows:</p>
<p>To Your Excellency, the Ambassador has the honor, according to the instructions of his government, to inform Your Excellency as follows: The Japanese government, in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Treaty Limiting Naval Armaments signed in Washington on February 6, 1922, hereby notifies the Government of the United States of its intention to terminate the said Treaty.

<h3>France's Attitude Towards Naval Treaty Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Naval Budget 2.9 Billion Francs</p>
<p>(Paris) When the Senate discussed the naval budget bill this morning, the chairman of the Naval Committee, Lear, issued a statement saying that the German navy has made great progress, and France's maritime defense is seriously insufficient. He requested the government to find ways to amend the Washington Naval Treaty to expand France's original total tonnage of naval vessels. Naval Minister Pittly said with a smile that France has always believed that the Washington Treaty can only meet the needs of the time. As for Japan's request for France to jointly declare the termination of the treaty, the reason why it was not approved was because France did not want to embarrass Britain and did not want to create a sense of alienation. However, France's position on the Washington Naval Treaty is still the same as that explained in the Washington meetings in 1922. After the discussion, the Senate voted to pass the naval budget bill, with a total amount of 29.03 billion francs, an increase of 24 million francs compared to the previous naval budget.

<h3>US Plans to Abandon Freedom of the Seas, Promote US-British Cooperation</h3>
<p>International Supervision of Arms Easier to Achieve</p>
<p>Generally Considered a Prelude to US Joining League of Nations</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources here today, the traditional American policy of freedom of the seas will be automatically abandoned under certain conditions in wartime. Senator Nye told the Associated Press today that he will introduce a bill to prohibit American merchant ships from flying the American flag when conducting commercial transactions with belligerent countries in wartime. The purpose of this proposal is to avoid the United States being dragged into future wars by protecting its people's neutral commerce. Nye also said that some aspects of the government strongly support his proposal, and when he announced this statement, Secretary of State Hull also recently stated that the State Department is studying the United States' neutral policy towards future wars. According to political observers, this proposed method is actually a prelude to the United States' revision or abandonment of the freedom of the seas policy, because the United States' participation in the European War was to maintain this policy. Some of President Roosevelt's advisors also believe that the United States should abandon this policy of demanding neutral rights for ships sailing to belligerent countries, because since 1812, the United States has repeatedly been drawn into international vortexes for this, and will be even more overwhelmed in the future. It is also heard that President Roosevelt himself is paying close attention to this matter. According to some observers, this is a natural result of the President's advocacy of limiting war profits and international control of arms transportation. Senator Nye also said that this move is also an expression of promoting international peace. There is much speculation here about whether the President, knowing that the public and congressional opinion support amending the American policy, will discuss it with other countries. Some even speculate whether the United States will propose this matter to Britain after the naval treaty is terminated, as a prerequisite for discussions between the two countries. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The United States' traditional policy of "freedom of the seas," which it has insisted on in the past, is now likely to be abandoned. It is generally seen as the first step for the United States to join the League of Nations, because the views of London and Washington on the issue of the right of neutral ships to pass through war zones have always been very different, eventually leading to serious disputes. If the United States abandons this policy, then the international community will lose one of the opportunities for disputes. This move by the United States is of great interest here, but until diplomatic documents arrive, it is still considered to be exploratory in nature, to see how American public opinion moves. It is also not accidental that the United States has the idea of abandoning freedom of the seas at a time when the US Senate committee is investigating the arms trade, and a movement has arisen advocating international control of the arms trade. It can be asserted that if Washington wants to approach London on the issue of international control of the arms trade, British public opinion will certainly be happy to support it. We still remember Privy Councilor Baldwin's speech at the Conservative Party conference in Glasgow on November 24, in which he said that before the United States' attitude is clear, the British Navy can never independently impose an armed blockade on any country in the world. His meaning is that the claim to impose sanctions on aggressor countries, if the United States does not abandon the principle of freedom of the seas and insist on trading with belligerent countries, then blockading aggressor countries and imposing sanctions is tantamount to causing opposition from the United States. From this, it can be seen that if the principle of freedom of the seas is abandoned, then international supervision of the arms trade will inevitably be easier to achieve, and the United States will also be closer to the League of Nations. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The US State Department plans to submit a proposal to President Roosevelt, advocating that the principle of neutrality be completely revised, and that the principle of freedom of the seas, which the United States has always advocated, may also be abandoned. The British press believes that a change in the White House's views can be seen here. The Morning Post reported, "President Roosevelt's preparation to abandon freedom of the seas will have a good impact on British policy, or may promote Britain's participation in the European continental security plan. (According to the new principles proposed by the State Department, in the future, whenever war breaks out between other countries, if American ships risk sailing in combat waters, the American government will not protect them. In this way, whenever sanctions are implemented and aggressor countries' ports are blockaded, Britain will not need to take the United States into account and can do it freely.) Since the last 18 months, the United States' attitude has often been unexpected. This matter is even more unexpected to the general public. The abandonment of freedom of the seas is still an idea and has not become a concrete proposal, but Secretary of State Hull has already proposed research or has obtained President Roosevelt's approval. This matter is really worth paying attention to, because the traditional policy of the US government is to be significantly changed." The Daily Express said, "If this move by the United States becomes a reality, then the greatest potential for war between Britain and the United States will be eliminated. If Britain and the United States join hands, there will be no possibility of war in the world, and world peace will also have made great progress." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>New Canal to Be Dug in Nicaragua</h3>
<p>Beneficial to US Commerce and Defense</p>
<p>Chairman of the Naval Committee Re-proposes Old Proposal</p>
<p>(Washington) Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Committee, has now put forward a proposal that was advocated 30 years ago to build a canal in Nicaragua to assist the Panama Canal. He said that the construction of the Nicaraguan Canal is necessary, because within five years, the locks of the Canadian canal will be too small to safely accommodate the new ships being built. Therefore, he advocates adopting the old plan to build this new canal, estimating that it will cost approximately 72.2 million yuan. The new canal is very beneficial in terms of commerce and national defense. He will discuss this matter with President Roosevelt soon. The general opinion of Congress is mostly in favor of building the Nicaraguan Canal. After this canal is built, it will be 172 miles long, from Clayton on the Atlantic coast via the Taizidu River, the San Juan River, and Lake Nicaragua to Brito on the Pacific coast, the most practical route. The United States had previously obtained the consent of the government of Nicaragua to send an engineering team of 400 people and a survey team led by Lieutenant General Jedwin, accompanied by two army and civil engineers, to measure the route connecting the two oceans. The survey showed that it was 177 miles long, 70 miles of which passed through Lake Nicaragua, and 55 miles passed through various rivers. This survey team returned to the country after completing its work in 1931. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Lee, chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Panama Canal, stated today that there is no need for a canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans through Nicaragua for at least 20 years, because there is no urgent need in terms of commerce, and it is not essential at this time in terms of military affairs. Lee's remarks were made in response to Congressman Vincent's announcement that he would propose the construction of the Nicaraguan Canal in Congress. Although there were repercussions in Tokyo today regarding the construction of the Nicaraguan Canal, Vincent remained silent, because the Tokyo Foreign Ministry called Vincent's "untimely declaration" a sign that the United States wants to dig this canal for strategic reasons, because the Panama Canal is sufficient to meet all commercial traffic needs. Vincent said today only that if his plan is passed by Congress, two points will be implemented first, namely, organizing a committee to study the canal route and its excavation costs.

<h3>Minister of the Army Hayashi Will Inspect the Puppet State's Reality Next Year</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi has long wanted to inspect the reality of "Manchukuo" after the Incident. Moreover, this time, he is also serving as the president of the Manchukuo Affairs Bureau while reforming the Manchukuo policy. Therefore, in terms of his actual duties, in addition to military affairs, he must inspect the reality of all aspects, such as the South Manchuria Railway and other aspects, in order to deepen his understanding. He is scheduled to go to "Manchukuo" to inspect around May, when the new agency's preparation is completed. Minister of the Army Hayashi made the following statement on the above-mentioned situation on the 18th: "Since I am also serving as the president of the Manchukuo Affairs Bureau this time, it would be inconvenient to do anything without inspecting the reality of "Manchukuo." Therefore, I feel it is necessary to go to Manchukuo to observe in detail the aspects that have not been communicated so far. However, the timing of going to Manchukuo is currently due to parliamentary relations and waiting for the commander of the South Army to take office. It is generally appropriate to do so when the new agency's preparation is completed." (Domei, 16th)</p>

<h3>Tax Evasion and Smuggling of Foreign Goods In and Out of China</h3>
<p>Britain Considers it Detrimental to Legitimate Trade</p>
<p>Cadogan Discussed it with Our Government</p>
<p>(London) Mendes, a Conservative Party member, asked the government in the House of Commons today to pay attention to the increasing tax evasion and smuggling of foreign goods into China after the increase in tariffs, and asked the government to discuss this matter with the Chinese government. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he was aware of the rampant smuggling of foreign goods in and out of China, which was detrimental to legitimate trade. The British Minister to China, Cadogan, had frequently discussed this with the Chinese government. He knew that the Chinese authorities had increased the number of anti-smuggling vessels. He felt that in this situation, there was no need to issue special instructions to Minister Cadogan. Conservative Party member Peter MacDonald inquired about the results of the British industrial delegation's investigation in Manchuria. Colville, Under-Secretary of State for Commerce, replied that the delegation was of a private nature. He had heard that the Federation of British Industries would soon publish a report on the delegation's work. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Yugoslav Foreign and Agriculture Ministers Resign</h3>
<p>Due to Handling of Geneva Diplomacy</p>
<p>No Words of Comfort from Cabinet</p>
<p>Public Demonstrations Against Hungary and Italy</p>
<p>(Belgrade) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić and Agriculture Minister Krnjajić resigned today due to disagreements with other cabinet members regarding domestic policy. It is believed that the two ministers had long intended to resign, and this was merely a pretext. The two ministers were displeased that the cabinet had accepted their report from Geneva on resolving the Yugoslav-Hungarian dispute without a single word of comfort. At the same time, the people of Yugoslavia have begun to express their dissatisfaction with the League of Nations' handling of the case. This morning, 5,000 people attempted to march to the Hungarian and Italian embassies to protest the League of Nations' resolution of the case, but were dispersed by a large contingent of police. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Belgrade) Another serious anti-Hungarian and anti-Italian demonstration took place here today, with over 10,000 participants. They attempted to storm the Italian and Hungarian embassies. During the demonstration, the Yugoslav Minister of War received praise from the crowd. The Yugoslav police were fully mobilized and temporarily closed traffic to the two embassies. Speakers shouted anti-Hungarian and anti-Italian slogans. Observers said that the capital of Yugoslavia had never seen such a serious action. The movement was launched last night and dispersed this morning. The situation in the capital is still very tense this morning. Speakers shouted warnings to pedestrians. The demonstrators last night were mostly students and paid homage at the tomb of the former king, expressing their dissatisfaction with the Geneva mediation and demanding that those responsible for the Marseilles massacre be severely punished. They initially gathered in the square of the grand theater, and 10,000 people gathered at their call, all members of patriotic groups. Speakers claimed that Yugoslav youth were patriotic and that this demonstration was the last time they would demonstrate, as they had decided to sacrifice themselves for the country next time. The demonstrators passed in front of the palace, singing patriotic songs and cursing Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya. The crowd was furious, and the police were barely able to cope. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Case of British Officer in the Saar to be Handled Judicially</h3>
<p>丨Question from Simon's Members丨</p>
<p>Another Conflict Occurs in a Café</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conflict between British police officers and the public in the Saar region, Foreign Secretary Simon recently issued a statement in the House of Commons, stating that this incident would not cause any political disputes, so there was no reason to fear. The jurisdiction of the Saar police force belongs entirely to the Saar Regional Administrative Commission, and the British government is not responsible for the recruitment and selection of personnel for this police force. Simon then gave an objective account of the incident and expressed regret, saying that the international force and the British government had nothing to do with the incident. Lansbury, leader of the Labour Party in the House of Commons, immediately asked whether it would be better to establish a common legal system for the international force and the recruited police force. Simon replied that the recruitment of Saar police in Britain was with the consent of the British government. Lansbury then asked whether the British government would be directly involved in the case if the British officer was beaten to death by the crowd. Simon then cut off the debate on this question, saying that it was more appropriate for the Saar Administrative Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of the International Force to take the necessary measures after consultation. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Saarbrücken) A second conflict occurred here today. The main figures were Major Hesley, the Chief of Police under the Saar Governing Commission, and Prince Lowenstein, a German national.

The cause of the conflict is unknown. However, according to Hesley, this matter may cause him to resign, and the attitude of the Chairman of the Governing Commission has not yet been expressed.

<p>Simon Calls it a Conflict in East Africa</p>
<p>British Border Commission Did Not Participate</p>
<p>Italy Demands Four Things from Abyssinia</p>
<p>(London) In the House of Commons today, members asked Foreign Secretary Simon to issue a statement regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Simon said that the British-Abyssinian Border Commission had arrived in the Walwal area of British Somaliland, a place where the Somalis had lived for generations. The area was under Italian control, and the Italian officers stationed there did not seem to have been informed of the Border Commission's movements. When the Commission requested to stay in the area, the Italian officers refused. The British representative protested, and the Border Commission withdrew to a place 30 miles inland. The Border Commission did not participate in the serious conflict between Italian and Abyssinian troops on December 5. After hearing about the conflict, the Border Commission received orders from London to withdraw from the area. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Officials announced today that on December 6, Italian Somaliland troops and a large Abyssinian army fought at Ualual, resulting in 30 Italian soldiers killed and 60 wounded.

The Abyssinian government has appealed to the League of Nations. The Italian government argues that the case was caused by Abyssinian soldiers firing on Italian sentries first. The Abyssinian government has also requested that the case be submitted to arbitration according to the Italian-Abyssinian Treaty of August 2, 1928. The Italian government replied that the details of the case were clear and there was no need for arbitration. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Survey of the Currency System in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xizhe, who went to Sichuan to investigate the currency system, reported that the Sichuan currency is roughly divided into (A) coins. Those that are relatively common throughout the province are (1) Sichuan Dragon Dollars of the Great Qing Dynasty, (2) Yuan Shikai silver dollars, (3) Sun Yat-sen silver dollars, (4) Sichuan-Yunnan half-yuan silver coins, and (5) Sichuan single and double silver coins. They are further divided by area. For example, Chengdu only uses Sichuan Dragon Dollars of the Great Qing Dynasty and Sichuan-Yunnan half-yuan coins. Sun Yat-sen silver dollars require a premium. Chongqing can use all of them because it is close to the Yangtze River. Jiangjin uses Sichuan Dragon Dollars of the Great Qing Dynasty and Yuan Shikai silver dollars. Those that use single silver coins do not use half-yuan silver coins. (B) There are dozens of types of copper auxiliary coins, ranging from 20 cash to 10,000 cash. The value varies from place to place, and the large number in circulation is impossible to calculate. The reason for the large number is the wars. In the past, every war in Sichuan took its expenses from the people. The people's strength was exhausted, and the financial resources were depleted. The military authorities then set up coin mints to cast copper coins. The value was not based on the composition, but on the marked number as the standard. For example, a copper coin the size of a square inch marked with 10,000 cash was used by the army as 10,000 cash, and one marked with 5,000 cash was used as 5,000 cash. Refusal to accept them was considered a crime. After the war, without military backing, the price fell. When the people used them to pay taxes, they still had to pay according to the market price. Therefore, the official minting price was one thing, and the market price was another. The official minting continued without stopping, and the currency system became more chaotic and beyond repair. (C) Auxiliary coins are divided into private bank deposit slips, village notes, and banknotes. In addition to the few banknotes issued by the Bank of China, the majority are deposit slips and village notes. All of the people's real estate can be mortgaged to private banks according to its value. The redeemer is responsible for the redemption, and the issuer takes a handling fee based on the chapter. The more deposit slips and village notes there are, the more chaotic the market finance becomes. (Special Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng To the Editors of the Shanghai Shenbao: We are deeply surprised to read your newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing on the 7th of this month stating that a breach of the Yellow River dike occurred half a li outside Puyang City in southern Hebei, rushing straight to the suburbs, with waves more than a zhang high over the city walls. Fortunately, the old Yellow River Jin Dike blocked the water, preventing it from reaching the city walls. However, the city is low-lying and there is a risk of it being submerged. The county magistrate is overseeing laborers day and night to rush to plug the Jin Dike. After investigating, this committee member was inspecting the project at Batou Jiugu Road on the 7th and 8th and did not hear of any breach of the Yellow River dike. When I instructed the Yellow River Affairs Bureau to investigate and reply, the steam telegram stated that the Jin Dike is half a li south of Puyang City. Currently, the water situation there is lower than before due to rush repairs to plug the breach, and there is no breach. Since this matter concerns the water situation and engineering conditions, the truth should be ascertained. We hereby telegraph your editorial department to investigate and make corrections to show the truth. We also hope to receive a reply. Respectfully, Kong Xiangrong, Member and Director of the Work Relief Group of the National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Ship Smuggles Tax and Shoots at Inspectors</h3>
<p>Japanese Ships Injure Many</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Both Sides in Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence Since Shanhaiguan was occupied by the Japanese army, the gateway to China has been opened. Japanese merchants have taken the opportunity to freely trade goods and sell them in the interior of our country, resulting in an influx of Japanese goods in North China. After the closure of Shanhaiguan, tax cards were increased, and the import of Japanese goods by land was restricted. Qinhuangdao Customs has also strictly inspected due to changing circumstances. On the surface, there is no blatant leniency, but Japanese merchants are still overbearing, fearless, and deliberately smuggling goods. Moreover, smuggled goods are not directly unloaded and taxed in Tianjin, but are secretly transported by merchant ships to the Shihe area for transfer to the interior. On the 8th of this month, while inspectors from Qinhuangdao Customs were on patrol, they suddenly saw a Japanese merchant ship loaded with goods secretly transporting them to Shihe. They immediately stopped it and attempted to inspect it, but the merchant ship refused to be inspected and set up machine guns on the deck to shoot at the inspectors, injuring many people. Threatened by violence, the inspectors were unable to stop it and only copied the ship's number and reported it to Qinhuangdao Customs to find a way to negotiate. Acte, the Customs Commissioner of Qinhuangdao Customs, regarded Iwai, the head of the Japanese special affairs agency in Shanhaiguan, as unavailable, so he rushed to Beiping. He reported to the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee and negotiated with Iwai. Iwai immediately telegraphed to summon the important officials of the puppet organization customs, Uchida and Harada, to come to Beiping for inquiry. Uchida and Harada arrived in Beiping on the 13th and stayed at the Fusang Hotel on Chongwenmen Avenue. They went to the Beijing Hotel to meet Iwai and report everything. After hearing the report, Iwai visited Yin Tong on the 14th to exchange views. At noon today (15th), he invited relevant personnel from both sides to the Beijing Hotel to discuss solutions, including Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Acte Iwai, Uchida, Harada, and Fujiwara, the Superintendent of Postal Affairs of the puppet organization. The meeting lasted for about three hours. Our side focused on punishing the Japanese merchant ship and guaranteeing that such unfortunate events would not happen again in the future. The details of the discussion are not known. For the sake of facilitating contact, Iwai moved from the Beijing Hotel to the Fusang Hotel tonight (15th). Negotiations will continue tomorrow (16th). After both sides reach a result in Beiping, they will submit it to their superiors for approval. (December 15th)</p>

On the same day, the Public Security Bureau, together with the Water Patrol Team, captured one of the robbers, Zhao Zhiyi, and interrogated him, who confessed without hesitation. The County Chamber of Commerce, at the request of the merchants, stated that during the winter defense period, robbery in broad daylight meant that merchants had no security, and requested severe punishment. The case was forwarded to the provincial authorities for severe punishment to deter bandits. The suspect has made a confession and handed it to the county government for trial. Today (the 18th), County Magistrate Jin ordered Xie Jingshan, Lao Jiaqi, He Pengnian, and Yu Jinghe, four shopmates from Rifeng Silver Shop, to appear in court. At the same time, a team was dispatched to sign and extract the suspect for questioning. Zhao Caishu, a clerk, presided over the trial.

<p>Wuxi: Tax Bureau Official Assaults People While Collecting Taxes</p>
<p>This year, the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office in this county has repeatedly had disputes due to its attempt to double the tax collection. After repeated mediation by the Chamber of Commerce, it was settled. Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, Pan Shusheng and two other officials from the office went to Xingda Small Cigarette Shop at the entrance of Taiping Lane to collect a license tax of four yuan. However, the shop was opened by an old woman, Chen Zhang, with a small capital and bleak business. Her daily sales profit was less than one yuan, and it was extremely difficult to maintain her business. Therefore, she requested that the tax payment be postponed until the Winter Solstice. Unexpectedly, Pan and others not only refused but also made loud noises and smashed the large glass on the counter. They also entered the counter and searched for cigarettes in the shop. Zhang was shocked and stepped forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, Pan pushed Zhang hard. Zhang was old and weak, and immediately fell to the ground and fainted, losing consciousness. The police arrived and took Pan to the Second Sub-bureau and presented him to the General Bureau for interrogation. The injured person was sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. After receiving a life-saving injection, she gradually recovered. Due to the serious injury, she is still being treated in the hospital.</p>

Yesterday (the 17th) at around 7:00 PM, after dinner, the gate was about to close, and after a little while someone knocked on the door, pretending to be buying rice. The people in the shop pulled the bolt and opened the door, and two robbers suddenly broke in, each holding a box gun, aiming at Yuan Chansheng and Xu Chanrong, strictly prohibiting them from making a sound, and demanding hundreds of yuan for travel expenses. After searching the account counter and other places without success, Yuan Chansheng was slapped a few times, and then they went inside to search and rob. In the second entrance, they found more than two hundred and forty silver dollars inside the treadle, and then they carried the money and left. Afterwards, the shop reported to the nearby police team for pursuit, but there was no trace.</p>

<p>Gaoyou: Small Steamship Encountered Danger Midway. Gu Zhutong, the Pacification Director stationed in Jiangxi, his younger brother and daughter, accompanied by his bodyguard, adjutant Wu Zhenxiang, and four guards, took the Henggui small steamship of the Fuhuai Company from Qingjiangpu to Zhen. On the 12th at about 9:00 PM, when they arrived south of Yingfanshui and north of Xiaohanzi in Ziying Dam, more than 30 lake bandits suddenly appeared and ordered the steamship to stop on the west embankment of the Grand Canal. At the same time, the Qinghuo class Xinbao of the Datong Company, fully loaded with passengers and goods, was also approaching. At that time, there was no way to stop the steamship. In the midst of the crisis, the patrol post of the 19th Squadron of the Water Public Security Team saw it and fired a warning shot. Afterwards, the entire team set off and fired across the river. After an hour of fighting, the bandits drove their boat towards Jieshou. The two steamships were escorted south by Yan Fei, the captain of the 16th Squadron of the Gaoyou Water Public Security Team.</p>
<p>Changshu: Gang of Thieves, Disguised as Refugees, Rob</p>

<p>Hangzhou: Three Major Shops Close in Succession</p>
<p>The Yixing Hosiery Factory and Yixinxing General Goods Store in Baoyoufang, Hangzhou, are both solely operated by merchant Wu Genxi. Their business has been good on weekdays. Recently, due to excessive credit sales and poor economic turnover, both shops simultaneously declared liquidation on the 17th. The amount of debt is 40,000 to silver money shops, 50,000 to depositors, and more than 30,000 to higher level trading shops, totaling more than 110,000 yuan. The inventory is less than 30,000 yuan, and the accounts receivable from Shanghai Jiangsu are 50,000 yuan, which are all old accounts from previous years and are difficult to collect. In reality, they are only worth 10% of their value. The creditors have held a meeting to discuss solutions. Furthermore, the Cheng Songmao Foreign Goods Store in Bijiaofang, an old store that has been open for 60 years, has also announced liquidation due to the decline in business. It owes 50,000 yuan to silver money shops and 30,000 yuan to higher level trading shops, totaling 80,000 yuan. Through mediation, it was decided to repay 60% in cash and issue Xinglong bills for the remaining 40% to be paid in installments.</p>
<p>Haimen: Wealthy Household Forces Death by Demanding Debt</p>
<p>Dai Zhang, the mother of farmer Dai Guozhang in Andong Township, Fifth District, borrowed ten silver dollars from Lu Tingzai, a wealthy household in the township, in the spring of last year, with the agreement to repay it in the early winter of the same year. Unexpectedly, for two years, there have been successive famines, and there has been no ability to repay. The day before (the 15th), Lu demanded repayment from Dai Zhang but was unsuccessful, so he wantonly insulted and scolded her, and said that he had already reported to the county government for arrest. Neighbors persuaded him, and Lu left unhappily. Dai Zhang was stimulated by this and became extremely resentful, and the thought of ending her life came to her mind. That night, she hanged herself. When her family discovered it, she had already died.</p>
<h3>Tax Police Assault Merchants, Causing Market Strike</h3>
<p>The 19th Detachment of the Tax Police in Wuling Village, Qidong, sent more than 30 team members to search for smuggled salt at Shen Chunmao's grocery store in Yinyang Town on the morning of the day before (the 13th). As a result, nothing was found. The shop owner, Shen Songru, argued with them and was hit in the chest, spitting blood. Nearby merchants Yu Qingxiang and Jiang Xuehai stepped forward to persuade, but were arrested by the tax police and taken to the team headquarters for detention. Thereupon, the merchants of the entire town were greatly angered and immediately went on strike and sent representatives to the county government to petition, requesting County Magistrate Li to write to the tax police team to release the arrested merchants and punish the assaulting team members. County Magistrate Li agreed to immediately send personnel to investigate and deal with the matter thoroughly. The representatives then withdrew. The next day (the 14th), after repeated negotiations between the county government and the team, there was still no result. As a result, stores in Jiangxia Village also joined the strike. As of yesterday (the 15th) afternoon, the matter had not been resolved, and the unrest may escalate.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Their Friends and Enemies from the Perspective of Anti-Chinese Sentiment (Continued)</h3>
<p>However, some specialists have expressed unexpected opinions. For example, Mr. Hainsworth, the former Deputy Colonial Secretary of Singapore, expressed surprise at the achievements of overseas Chinese in his lecture at the Summer School of the Royal Empire Society in Oxford last month. However, summarizing his views, there was a regrettable advocacy for suppressing the Chinese. Mr. Hainsworth's dissatisfaction and over-concern with overseas Chinese can be divided into the following three points: (1) The overseas Chinese population in Malaya is too large. For example, the number of overseas Chinese in Perak and Selangor is more than that of Malays. In the future, Malaya may become the 19th province of China. (2) The interests of Malays should be supported to suppress the Chinese. (3) The overseas Chinese born locally are loyal residents of the United Kingdom, while newly immigrated overseas Chinese are not.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the reason why there are so many overseas Chinese in Perak and Selangor is because the tin mining area there is vast. According to the annual report of the Malayan Federal Mining Bureau, the result of the survey in 1930 showed that the total area of tin mining leased land in Malaya was 181,818 acres. Among them, Perak accounted for 114,108 acres and Selangor accounted for 43,681 acres. The two places together accounted for 157,789 acres, that is, 86.7% of the total tin mining area in Malaya. At present, there are no other workers suitable for tin mining, only overseas Chinese are the most suitable, and women are the most缘故 of overseas Chinese. Perhaps Mr. Hainsworth did not know this fact obtained from economic analysis, so he was surprised. That is not surprising. As for the large population, since it is an economic condition to establish a province, it is also a political activity issue. Just ask Mr. Hainsworth, why is Hong Kong, with the largest number of Chinese, not a special city in China? Then, the evaluation of his words will be solved immediately.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, the so-called supporting the interests of Malays to suppress the Chinese, I think this sentence is indeed a misunderstanding caused by not observing from the economic principles and economic facts. I remember that a British person once said this sentence: "If there were no overseas Chinese, I am afraid there would be no Malaya today." It is known that the economic development of overseas Chinese in Malaya only creates local prosperity, but earns a little living information from the prosperity. Local prosperity is the prosperity of Malays, and it is the "co-existence and co-prosperity" of various residents in the settlement. It ignores the reason why there are so many overseas Chinese and why the place needs so many Chinese. We can answer from many aspects, but in the simplest words, it can be said that the work done by overseas Chinese is not something that Europeans and Americans are willing to do, and it is not something that scholars (Malays) can do. This is by no means our arrogance, it is indeed a historical fact. Mr. Hainsworth may have forgotten and misunderstood. If someone asks again, does supporting Malays to suppress the Chinese also mean supporting America or suppressing England? Then, how will Mr. Hainsworth respond?</p>
<p>Regarding the third point, the claim that overseas Chinese born locally are loyal residents of the United Kingdom, while newly immigrated overseas Chinese are not, is also a scene seen with colored glasses. In fact, generally speaking, overseas Chinese are inherently honest and peaceful. Their diligence and hard work overseas are not only unmatched by any other nationals, but their compliance with local order and laws is also unmatched by any other nationals. Overseas Chinese born locally have become accustomed to a pure and docile temperament, which is the legacy of the innate nature of overseas Chinese. Perhaps newly immigrated overseas Chinese do not understand the local situation as well as those born locally, and they have a thicker concept of the ancestral country, which has caused Mr. Hainsworth to mistakenly believe that it is a manifestation of disloyalty. However, the spirit of adventure and sacrifice brought by overseas Chinese from their motherland, if Mr. Hainsworth can examine it more closely from the facts, he will understand that overseas Chinese are helpful to British rule.

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Solemnly Declares Inflation Absolutely Untrue</h3>
<p>Tang Shoumin Also Said There Was No Such Need</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: Recently, rumors in the market that the government would implement inflation and reduce the fineness of silver coins have caused gold prices in the market to skyrocket, changing rapidly, and people's hearts are shaken, unable to rest at ease. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, in particular, stated to reporters from Huadong News Agency at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance at 8 pm last night that although there have been various rumors recently, claiming that the government will implement inflation and reduce fineness, the government itself has no such intention and no such proposition. All the external rumors are untrue. Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, also declared to reporters from Huadong News Agency last night that China absolutely does not need inflation. Shanghai is originally a market of rumors, and all the rumors are just speculations by speculators to confuse the public. As for the amount of silver reserves, it is irrelevant to the overall situation. The rice, cotton, and other goods needed by Shanghai are all transported from other places. If goods from the interior are needed, silver will naturally flow into the interior, which is absolutely irrelevant to the overall situation. This is how it can be called mobile finance. Ten years ago, the silver reserves in Shanghai were much less than they are now, but there were no chaotic phenomena at that time, which is clear evidence. (Note: The current silver reserves in Shanghai are still 300 million.) As for the silver transported to foreign ports by foreign banks, it must be transported back when the time is right. The government may be able to find a way to compensate for all the lost balancing tax. However, as for the rumor that the balancing tax will be refunded, this is a matter for the government, and I personally do not know the inside story.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

According to Mr. Liu, when interviewed by reporters, the communist bandits entrenched in Henan Province have been completely suppressed after painful encirclement and suppression. The remaining bandits are fleeing to Sichuan Province, but their numbers are small and their weapons are not complete. It is expected that they can all be eliminated in the near future. Currently, the financial revenue and expenditure of Henan Province are roughly balanced, and various constructions have gradually been put on track. What needs to be carried out urgently at present is the rehabilitation of the bandit areas and the relief of the victims of floods and droughts. The provincial government is making proper arrangements for this, and strive to advance both work relief and emergency relief at the same time. Fortunately, the rural harvest this year is still abundant, and there should be no more famine next spring. I came here to take the opportunity to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, and to travel to Shanghai for a short time, and to visit relatives and friends in Shanghai. Besides, there is no important task. After staying in Shanghai for a while, I will return to Henan to perform my duties.</p>

Manufacturers and exporters who want to promote their products abroad can write to the Guidance Office of the Trade Bureau for introduction.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Develops Trade with Nanyang</h3>
<p>Gather Exporters Today to Exchange Ideas</p>
<p>Nanyang is a vast region with thousands of islands, a warm climate, and abundant products. Hundreds of millions of overseas Chinese have lived and resided there for more than 700 years. Most of the industrial and commercial undertakings are controlled by overseas Chinese. Therefore, China occupies a considerable position in trade with Nanyang. In recent years, the universality of economic panic and the sharpness of commercial competition have had a profound impact on export trade. The International Trade Bureau, in order to seek to rescue and strive for development, seeks the opinions of various merchants on how to enable domestic goods manufacturers to sell their products in Nanyang, how to make overseas Chinese adopt domestic goods in their hearts, how to seek convenience in exchange rates, and reduction in freight. All must be discussed in detail and implemented step by step. It is decided to convene a meeting at the Bureau at 1040 North Bund of New Rubbish Bridge at 2:00 pm today (the 19th). The Bureau has now notified various merchants related to export trade to Nanyang to send representatives to attend and discuss everything.</p>

<h3>The Harvard Ship Has Completely Sunk</h3>
<p>Norwegian Consulate Received Witness Testimony Yesterday</p>
<p>Insurance Company Salvages Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The Tongde ship of the Tongde Shipping Company, which is represented by Dafaxing, collided with the Norwegian Harvard ship, which is represented by Meishun Company, the day before yesterday morning. The Harvard ship completely sank yesterday. The 16,500 bags of Siamese Guangyulong Rice Factory rice shipped to Shanghai Wu Guangjilong Firm are being salvaged by Guangjilong's hired workers. At the same time, the Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai summoned the Harvard ship's personnel for questioning. The Tongde ship will be towed into the shipyard for repairs today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Harvard Sinks: After the Harvard ship had an accident, although Whitedaway Company sent three large barges to tie up to the side of the Harvard ship to increase support and reduce draft, the hole in the bow caused too much water to enter, and the weight of the waterlogged rice gradually increased. Therefore, it still sank yesterday morning. The Whitedaway barge was ineffective in supporting it and also untied its cable and left.</p>
<p>Siamese Rice Source: The foreign rice loaded on the Harvard ship was transported by Shanghai Sichuan Road's Wu Guangjilong Firm, which specializes in rice, timber, forestry, and exchange import and export goods (Guangyuanlong Head Office) from Siam. The firm has Guangyulong Rice Factory and Guangjinlong Sawmill in Siam. The 16,500 bags of foreign rice transported this time were insured by Yangzi, Jardine Matheson, and New Zealand Insurance Companies. However, Guangjilong has not yet received notification from the Siamese head office regarding the total amount of insurance.</p>
<p>Salvaging Foreign Rice: Now that the Harvard has sunk, the rice will inevitably swell after being soaked in water. If it exceeds the capacity of the cabin too much, the hull will explode. Therefore, yesterday, Guangjilong, together with the insurance company, hired four strong, water-savvy workers to wear rubber outerwear and enter the cabin to salvage the rice. However, only more than 400 bags were salvaged yesterday, and the salvage will continue today.</p>
<p>Consulate Summons: The Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai, based on the Harvard's report, in order to clarify the issue of responsibility, summoned the ship's captain, chief mate, second mate, and chief engineer to 110 Sichuan Road at 3 pm yesterday. The Deputy Consul Jilder questioned them in a quiet room. He first questioned the captain, Suri, for an hour, and then questioned the chief mate and others until 7 pm, when the matter was still not completed.</p>
<p>Report to the Navigation Bureau: Tongde Shipping Company, 131 Jiangxi Road, yesterday sent a letter to the Navigation Administration Bureau stating: "Sir, our Tongde ship collided with the Norwegian ship Harvard in the Huangpu River this morning. Our ship was damaged. The details will be reported after the shipowner's report is sent. We hereby report it for your reference."</p>
<p>Navigation Bureau Inspection: The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications sent technician Wang Xinyuan to Lujiazui, Pudong, the day before yesterday afternoon to inspect the Harvard ship. However, technician Wang has not yet submitted a written report to the bureau. As for the Tongde ship, it was originally scheduled to send a member of the Navigation Administration Bureau and an insurance company ship surveyor to the No. 3 buoy at the four sites in Pudong to inspect the damage. Later, due to the water entering the ship, it was difficult to see through. It was changed to today (19th) to be towed into the old dock of the Coconut Pine Shipyard (opposite Dongjiadu) in Pudong to drain the water, and then inspected again tomorrow (20th).</p>
<h3>Philippine Speaker Quezon Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday to Return to the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government and Others Sent Representatives to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Mr. Quezon Went Ashore for a Short Rest and Left Shanghai in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Former Philippine Senate President Quezon passed through Shanghai on the President Coolidge of the Great American Company yesterday to return to the Philippines. The ship entered port at 1 am yesterday morning and berthed at buoys 12 to 13 in the center of the Huangpu River. Municipal Government representative Tang Shixuan and Zhao Tiezhang, representative of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to welcome him by taking a small launch of Great American Company from the Customs Wharf at 7 am yesterday morning. Mr. Quezon took the company's launch across the Huangpu River at noon and went ashore at the Customs Wharf. He went straight to the Cathay Hotel to rest. Then, at about 4 pm, he took the company's launch across the Huangpu River again and boarded the original ship. He left Shanghai at 5:30 pm to return to the Philippines. According to Mr. Quezon, when interviewed by reporters from Xinxin News Agency yesterday, he felt a little uncomfortable due to the fatigue of the journey, and he had to take the original ship back to the Philippines at 5:30 pm this afternoon (that is, yesterday). The time for staying in Shanghai was limited, so he was unable to accept the invitations from all walks of life in Shanghai to give a lecture on international issues. He apologized for this. It is also learned that various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the International Affairs Research Association originally planned to hold a grand banquet that day to entertain Mr. Quezon, but because he was unwell, he politely declined, so it has been temporarily cancelled.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese General Tang Juwu Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Carrying Out Work to Save His Hometown</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: Tang Juwu, a famous anti-Japanese general from the Northeast who led the People's Self-Defense Anti-Japanese Army in the areas of Huai'ren, Tonghua, and Andong in Liaoning Province for two years, has been traveling to Shanghai from Beiping, Hankou, and Nanjing since entering the customs. He arrived here a few days ago. The reporter of Xinsheng News Agency specially visited him at his residence. According to him, although the land in Northeast China has been lost, the hearts of the people are still alive. The people in various places are eagerly hoping that the people of the country will have a proper solution for the Northeast, and they are all waiting for an opportunity to launch an uprising. Therefore, I am very optimistic about the atmosphere of unity in the country. However, the Japanese are using opium, white flour, morphine, gambling, and pornography to anesthetize the people in the Northeast. Although the local people know the harm, they can't do anything about it. I hope that my compatriots in the country will not poison themselves. As for my coming here, because I failed to save the entire Northeast, I came to Shanghai to prepare for the work of saving my hometown. There are many fellow villagers from the Northeast who are stranded in Shanghai and have no home to return to. I plan to find a way to help them. When there is an opportunity in the future, I will return to the Northeast to continue my original aspiration of resisting Japan. Mr. Tang also firmly believes that although the Northeast is temporarily lost, it will eventually be recovered by us. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that the people of the country can work hard and strive to work hard, and not be poisoned by foreigners and poison themselves. It is heard that since Mr. Tang arrived in Shanghai, he has met with important figures in the Northeast business community, such as Shi Bingyan, to discuss the work of saving his hometown.</p>

<p>In the Face of Imminent War, Shanghai's Air Defense Construction is Important</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Radio Broadcast by Su Gongwang</h3>
<p>Urging Citizens to Concentrate Efforts on Building Air Defenses</p>
<p>An air defense lecture series began on the 18th of this month. Every Tuesday from 4:20 PM to 5:00 PM, air defense experts will broadcast on the China-West Radio station. Yesterday was the first lecture, given by Mr. Su Gongwang, who spoke on "The Importance of Shanghai's Air Defense Construction Amidst the Impending Great War." His arguments were quite insightful. Mr. Su's lecture manuscript is published below:</p>
<p>The Second World War Is Inevitable</p>
<p>Since the "1918" incident, Japan has used its superior military force to occupy our four northeastern provinces, creating a serious situation in the Far East. At the same time, the London Economic Conference and the Geneva Disarmament Conference both ended in failure, and international peace treaties were similarly reduced to waste paper. The order of world peace has been severely threatened on all sides, thus beginning the prelude to the Second World War. Due to the economic conflicts and conflicting interests of the great powers, "war" has become the only solution. We see that at the recent naval preparatory conference in London, Japanese imperialism, in order to realize its ambition to forcibly occupy the East Asian continent, insisted on equal naval ratios, even at the risk of isolating itself and shouting the slogan of abolishing the naval treaty. Such a serious development fully exposes the inevitability of the Second World War, especially the inevitability of war in the Far East. However, when we analyze the internal cause and the results of this great war, whether a war between Japan and the United States breaks out first, or a war between Japan and Russia breaks out first, China will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Shanghai, in particular, will bear the brunt. In this serious terror, are we willing to be trampled upon, slaughtered, and invaded? Of course, humanity will never sit idly by and wait for death. Not only will we not sit idly by, but we must also consider effective countermeasures to protect our territory, continue our existence, and thereby revive our nation. What we call effective methods here are sound military preparations and strong national defense.</p>
<p>Warfare Increasingly Trends Towards Air Power</p>
<p>However, the form of military warfare has greatly changed since the European War. Because of the invention and progress of airplanes, the resulting development of war tools has entered a new, more cruel, and more tragic form. The space world, which humans once regarded as the realm of the gods, is now unhindered due to the invention of aircraft. Therefore, the current form of warfare has expanded to include the air, in addition to land and sea, as a new battlefield for slaughtering humans. At the same time, the form of warfare has also shifted from two-dimensional land and sea battles to three-dimensional air battles. Past local battles of vying for front lines and fighting enemy troops have now expanded to include all-out battles of attacking cities and destroying the enemy's national strength. Therefore, the scope of war has no distinction between front and rear lines, or between war and non-war zones. The target of slaughter is not soldiers but civilians. Because enemy planes invading from the air have no natural barriers and can penetrate deep without obstruction, the scope of their destruction and slaughter is also limitless. Once the war begins, enemy planes will invade, and the country's territory and people's lives will be at risk of being destroyed, with no possibility of escaping. The American politician Rausell said, "Within ten years, a great war will break out in Europe, most of which will be limited to air combat. No less than tens of thousands of planes will participate in the war. The longest duration of the war will be no more than twelve hours." These few simple words fully demonstrate the trend of future wars and the power of modern air forces.</p>
<p>National Defense's Top Priority is Building Air Defenses</p>
<p>As a result of the development of air forces, countermeasures arise with the times. According to the law of scientific invention, wherever there is active pressure, there is passive resistance. Wherever new weapons are invented, weapons to resist them are discovered. Therefore, the primary condition for national defense at present is air defense equipment. Although the central tool of modern warfare has turned to the air force, and the degree of cruel poisoning and killing is thousands of times more effective than the killing power of the past land and sea armies, all countries are now engaged in air defense construction, in addition to studying military aviation. Thus, they are loudly shouting the slogan, "Without air defense, there is no national defense; without national defense, there is no nation," in order to make the people aware of air defense. Because modern national defense war preparations, if only making two-dimensional resistance on land and sea, and lacking three-dimensional air defense, is tantamount to rejecting wolves in the front and not guarding against tigers in the back. When enemy planes attack from the air, we can only wait for death, allowing them to destroy and slaughter at will.</p>
<p>Countries Around the World are Striving to Promote It</p>
<p>Recently, countries around the world have been promoting air defense preparations as if they are crazy. The people also regard it as a matter of urgency and are vying to promote their "patriotic" spirit, doing their best to assist the government's air defense construction and personal protection facilities. Exercises and training are constantly carried out. The prerequisite for war is how to maintain national strength and place it in safety, and only then can we talk about war. Only by being able to defend can we attack. Only by being able to maintain the country's survival position can we destroy the enemy's combat capabilities. When the war begins, the other side will inevitably take its main air force to attack the political center, military source, important urban organizations, and all war-related forces of the enemy country. If we want to resist and win, then the prerequisite is to have a safe order and continuous industrial and commercial manufacturing, so that the people's hearts can be calmed and military strength can be replenished. Therefore, in the military aspect now, not only must there be air defense equipment, but also non-war zones need sound air defense facilities. If we look at our country's scientific backwardness, national defense military preparations are very weak, especially air defense construction, which is simply non-existent. As evidenced by the Songhu battle, the Japanese army's planes wantonly bombed. Our national army, which persisted for dozens of days, had to announce a retreat and endure humiliation to stop the war because it had no air defense equipment. As a result, the Jing'an area of our Shanghai city, which was the essence of the war zone, was bombed, innocent people were killed and injured, and public and private property was infinitely lost. In this infinite damage, after the pain subsided, we have fully felt that without air defense equipment, there is no safe guarantee. In other words, national defense preparations without air defense facilities are not enough to resist invading enemies. People's lives without air defense equipment are not enough to be prolonged.</p>
<p>The Lessons of the Disastrous Defeats in Shanghai and North China</p>
<p>Although the people of the country have suffered the painful lessons of the fall of the Northeast and the disastrous defeats in the Shanghai and North China battles in recent years, there was once a heated mood of advocating aviation to save the country. One call brought a hundred responses, and there was considerable success. However, everyone has overlooked the overall issue of national air defense. If we want to use our planes to drive away enemy planes, so that they cannot invade the airspace over our territory, and to cover our important areas and eliminate their destructive and slaughtering power, we must of course enrich our air defense aviation construction in order to preserve it before talking about attack. At the same time, once enemy planes drop bombs and spread poison, we must have preparations for resistance and rescue. Therefore, we must not only have sound military air defense, but also universal civilian air defense, so that the people can be engaged in rescuing bombing and avoiding the tragedy of being poisoned, and further protect their lives and maintain their property. Therefore, our civilian air defense facilities are indeed urgent and cannot be ignored in the slightest. However, to implement civilian air defense, the people must know the defensive measures and rescue methods for the explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, and poison gas bombs used by enemy planes in air raids in order to achieve practical results. Because the means by which the air force attacks the enemy's rear areas and slaughters the people are only these three types. If we can have rescue facilities to deal with these three means, we can be said to have civilian air defense protection. Given the vastness of our country's territory and the length of our coastline, and the current lack of air defense facilities, once war breaks out, the entire country will inevitably fall into the hands of the enemy's air force, and there is a possibility of destruction at any time and anywhere. However, the most important cities in various places will bear the brunt.</p>
<p>Air Defense Construction Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>Shanghai is a transportation hub in the Far East, a huge commercial port in the world, and the economic center of our country, and the first line of defense of the national capital. If the enemy's air force invades, it will inevitably be regarded as more important than any other place. Then the difficulties Shanghai will suffer will inevitably be more tragic than any other place. This is undeniable. Therefore, given the importance of Shanghai's terrain, air defense construction is even more urgent in terms of the overall national defense conditions. Now the area of the prosperous area of Shanghai is only more than 240 square miles. If we use modern air force's poison gas bombs, using 30 kilograms of poison gas in one square mile can poison all humans and animals. Then, in an area of 240 square miles, only 7,200 kilograms of poison gas can poison our entire population of three or four million in Shanghai. Moreover, the weight carried by airplanes now is usually more than 1,000 kilograms. If the enemy's air force has already decided to come and poison us in Shanghai, it will only take five or six planes at most to succeed. What's more, the air raid methods they implement are poison gas bombs and incendiary bombs dropped at the same time. Then the disaster in Shanghai is even more inevitable. Moreover, when the impending great war breaks out, it will not be a separate war between certain countries, but will inevitably cause a general mobilization of countries around the world, resulting in a human massacre. We know that since the target of the declaration of war is a majority of countries, then the so-called safe area of the Shanghai Concession will also inevitably be at risk of air force bombing and poisoning. Perhaps because the essence is concentrated in the concession, the danger is even more tragic. This impending danger is not an exaggeration. The air defense exercises in the Public Concession a couple of days ago, as long as we explore it from the standpoint of defense, we will know that it is not an accidental action. It is worth a great deal of vigilance for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Concentrate Efforts to Save Yourself and Others</p>
<p>However, this danger is of course frightening and terrifying, but the only way to resolve this disaster is to rely on the united mobilization of all the citizens of Shanghai to concentrate all their efforts to build air defense to save themselves and others. Otherwise, the city's prosperity will turn into a field of rubble, and the healthy bodies of the citizens at this time will be flying flesh and blood in the future. As the saying goes, "Shanghai Bund, Shanghai Bund, will one day turn into the Huangpu River." Now that Shanghai's position is felt to be so dangerous, if we do not consciously and actively engage in air defense construction, the saying may come true. Then, if we want to preserve the safety of the country's territory and maintain the continuation of life and property, we can only concentrate our automatic strength, escape from death, build an iron-net air defense, resist the enemy, and defend the country. This is the only way out, he said.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Sent a Telegram of Condolence to Yan Xishan of Shanxi on the Death of His Father</h3>
<p>After the death of Mr. Yan Xishan's father, Shutang, in his hometown due to illness, important central figures sent telegrams of condolence.

The original text is recorded below: "To Director Yan Baigong of Taiyuan, upon hearing of the passing of your respected father, I am extremely shocked and saddened. Your filial piety is innate, and you must be extremely grieved. However, remembering your father's high virtues and great prestige, admired by the whole country, and having personally seen you establish the country's territory and appease the homeland, with a good steed, there are no regrets. I urge you to accept the change and control your grief, and take care of yourself for the sake of the country. I respectfully send a telegram of condolence, your brother, Kong Xiangxi, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Preparation for the Construction of a Fire Brigade in the Central District</h3>
<p>The Directors of Preparation and Standing Committee Members Have Been Elected</p>
<p>The city is preparing to build a fire brigade in the central district. Previously, Wang Xiaolai and other members of the Zhabei Fire Brigade Union initiated a request to the municipal government to allocate more than three acres of land at the corner of Xiangyin Road and Guoji North Road to build a club, in order to protect the safety of citizens in the area. Since the two bureaus of public works and land jointly surveyed and erected boundary markers to determine the location, Zhang Qiansan and Li Jinyu and other directors of the association have enthusiastically sponsored the accumulation of funds to carry out the design of this plan. Architectural experts were specially hired to conduct a precise study and draw up the latest palace-style drawings, which are quite solemn in scale. It is estimated that the cost will be around 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the association convened directors and committee members of various fire brigades in Zhabei yesterday to discuss in detail and actively prepare. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Binyan, and Chen Songyuan were elected as the directors of preparation on the spot. The original directors, committee members, and directors of each association are naturally the directors of preparation. In addition, nine people, including Chen Weihan, were elected from the directors of preparation to serve as standing committee members to be responsible for preparing everything. As for the funds, there are already ways to raise them. Once the municipal government approves it, construction will begin on a scheduled basis.</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing and Others Telegraphed the Chairman of Jiangxi Requesting that Shanghai's Domestic Manufacturers Not Be Discriminated Against</h3>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Rehabilitation Donation Should Be Given the Same Treatment as Hunan and Hubei</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association participated in the Jiangxi Provincial Exhibition, but the province's tax bureau collected a bandit suppression rehabilitation donation, which was not given the same treatment as manufacturers in Hunan and Hubei. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the chairman of the province, Xiong Shihui, requesting that he order the tax bureau to give equal treatment and no longer discriminate. The original telegram said, "To Your Excellency Tianyi, Chairman, Shanghai China National Products Manufacturers Association is participating in the China National Products Jiangxi Provincial Exhibition, which has been postponed again and again due to various reasons. Participating manufacturers have suffered considerable losses. However, your province's collection of bandit suppression rehabilitation donation has not been given the same treatment as manufacturers in Hunan and Hubei, which has caused various manufacturers to blame the association. We believe that national products are still in their infancy, and it is essential to promote and publicize them. Therefore, we specially telegraph to request that you immediately order the tax bureau to give the same treatment as manufacturers in Hunan and Hubei, collecting 50% to alleviate the concerns of merchants and maintain national products. We are sincerely grateful, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, respectfully."</p>

<h3>The Case of Malfeasance by the Haimen Party Committee</h3>
<p>Trial Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Bingyu, Cao Dingshi, and others, the fourth executive committee members of the Haimen County Party Department, were recently accused by 71 party members who filed a complaint with the higher party department, alleging that Chen and others had received bribes from the Yuantai Company (a drug agency) of 340 yuan per month, etc. The higher authorities designated the Shanghai District Court to hear the case. After investigation by the prosecutor, they were prosecuted for malfeasance. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Guan Liting specially opened the 10th courtroom to hear the case and ordered the detention of Chen Bingyu and Cao Dingshi to be brought to the court. According to Chen, he is 35 years old, from Haimen, and is an executive committee member of the Haimen County Party Department. He has an elderly mother and two children at home and owns 40 acres of farmland. He graduated from Nantong Zhongshan School and has been working in party affairs for less than three years.

He has a mother, a sister, and a brother and sister-in-law at home. He studied at the university until the first year, but did not graduate. He absolutely denies the matter of the Yuantai Company. The question officer stated that the witnesses were not complete and the lawyer had not reported, so he ordered the hearing to be adjourned. The two defendants were returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association Jointly Implements Labor Relief and Emergency Relief in Gaochun</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association and the China and Foreign Righteousness Relief Association jointly implemented labor relief and emergency relief in Gaochun County, Jiangsu Province. Mr. Ling Daoyang was publicly appointed as the director of relief and set off immediately. The association has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate the disaster situation in Gaochun. Although it is slightly lighter than Liyang, the total number of disaster victims is more than 98,000, which cannot be resolved without a large amount of money. Due to the shortage of funds, they had no choice but to change their policy and implement labor relief. The China and Foreign Righteousness Relief Association allocated 9,000 yuan for relief, and the association allocated 6,000 yuan for relief. Work will begin soon. If there is any surplus money from the labor relief, emergency relief will be added to it. It is better than nothing. In this biting cold wind, all the great philanthropists, caring for the afflicted, will surely be moved.</p>

<p>X27 in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Mysterious Woman Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Extensive Socializing in Shanghai; Makes a Living with Japanese Language Skills</p>
<p>Encounters French Officer; Leading to Today's Events</p>
<p>Served as a Japanese Spy During the January 28th Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Our Shanghai Correspondent Reports: Regarding the military attaché's assistant of a certain country's embassy in Japan, Mr. Taishi Microw, who used Japanese women to implement a "seduction tactic" to advance their espionage work, it has been reported in various newspapers that Mr. Taishi used many Japanese women, among whom the most important is said to be Ms. Mon Mutsumi Noriko, residing in Shanghai without a license. Mon Mutsumi Noriko graduated from a certain English school in Kobe and, after arriving in China, traveled to Nanjing, Hankou, Hong Kong, and other places. Eventually, she settled in Shanghai, making a living by teaching Japanese to Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p>Mixed Race Woman: It is rumored that Noriko is of mixed Japanese and Portuguese descent. She is very socially active. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Noriko once served as a Japanese spy and made significant contributions to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese side, imitating the actions of a famous German spy during the European war, also praised Noriko as "X-27". Consequently, almost everyone knows about "X-27", making her comparable to Kawashima Yoshiko. This woman currently resides in Apartment 8, No. 208 Nanyang Road, Hongkou. Although she is forty years old, she is still very beautiful. She lives alone and her life is very mysterious. Mon Mutsumi Noriko is also a Western worshiper, so she avoids associating with Japanese people in Shanghai. Noriko's acquaintance with Mr. Taishi also originated from teaching Japanese, and there are some hidden details within. However, after this matter was exposed in Tokyo, Mon Mutsumi Noriko was also affected in Shanghai. Therefore, to clarify her personal sentiments, Noriko has issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Handsome Man: I have read the Japanese newspapers and am extremely surprised. When I first read the local Japanese newspaper, I thought it was a rumor, and I couldn't sleep that night. However, the next morning, the English newspaper published it, even revealing Mr. Taishi's name. This matter came so suddenly, it was truly unimaginable. Lieutenant Taishi was my Japanese language student. Three and a half years ago, I came to Shanghai from the mainland, traveling to various parts of China. There was absolutely no connection. Out of necessity, I placed an advertisement in the English newspaper, teaching Japanese grammar. Unexpectedly, this advertisement was seen by Lieutenant Taishi, and he became my student. This was an unforeseen fact. At the time, Mr. Taishi was a member of a gunboat. He was a young, handsome man with elegant manners. He studied Japanese with me for no more than six months.</p>
<p>Spy Report: Later, he transferred to the Tokyo Consulate in French Indochina and continued studying Japanese. Not long after, a love triangle incident occurred, and he returned to Marseille. At the time, the Navy lacked Japanese translators, so Mr. Taishi pursued his plan to study in Japan. As expected, he passed the exam and was granted a one-year study period. On his way to Japan, he visited me again in Shanghai. At this time, I had just moved from the French Concession to the Public Concession. For the convenience of his life in Japan, I offered various suggestions for going to Japan. At this time, there were other students in my room, also military attachés from a certain country. The two met and spoke in English, enjoying each other's company. Mr. Taishi asked, "Which agency is currently handling your country's intelligence work?" The military attaché replied, "Everything belongs to the embassy." I am not a soldier, so I naturally do not know the details of their conversation.</p>
<p>One Year: However, I believed that their purpose in going to Japan was solely to study Japanese. Therefore, I introduced them to families in Tokyo that I knew. At the same time, I advised them to cut off social interactions and concentrate on their studies. Moreover, I suggested that if they could get to know upper-class Japanese families and Japanese-French language exchange professors after arriving in Tokyo, it would be very convenient. After arriving in Tokyo, he wrote to inform me of his current situation. I thought that a male-female relationship would easily attract the attention of outsiders, so I wrote back advising him to be careful. Around December of last year, he wrote to me, saying that his term was expiring and he was preparing to return home, lamenting the difficulty of understanding Japanese, saying that he had not made much progress in the past year. I advised him that a country's language cannot be mastered in a day. Progress gradually, and success will come naturally. He took my words as a sincere suggestion and expressed his special gratitude.</p>
<p>No News: Now, reading the newspaper, what is reported is completely contrary to the facts. This is a fact that I cannot bear. His letter was noticed by the police in April or May of this year. After I moved in July, I informed him of the move, which was forwarded by the embassy. After that, there was simply no news. I am his good Japanese language teacher. This can be seen in my usual sincere advice and teachings. To say that I and he are engaged in espionage activities is something I never expected. I am not a woman from tea houses, dance halls, or cafes. At any time, I have never forgotten to boast of Japanese consciousness, etc. It was recently reported that the Japanese military police had arrested him for interrogation and escorted him to Tokyo. Judging from this statement, it can be known that it is not entirely accurate. X72 is still taking advantage of her language skills and living freely in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Military and Police Thoroughly Suppress Pirates After the Hijacking of the Xin Hai Men Steamer</h3>
<p>Many Bandits Killed; Pursuit Continues</p>
<p>Passengers and Crew Rescued and Arrived in Ningbo</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Agency reports: The Xin Hai Men steamer of the Xin Hai Men Steamer Company, en route from Ningbo to Wenzhou, was hijacked by pirates. After military and police suppression, the kidnapped passengers and crew were rescued, and many bandits were killed. The details, as learned by our correspondent from the shipping industry in Shanghai, are as follows:</p>
<p>Military and Police Suppression: After the Xin Hai Men steamer was infiltrated and hijacked by Taizhou pirates, the company reported to military and police units in various locations. Subsequently, the 6th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force, together with the 2nd Brigade of the Water Police, dispatched armed military and police to suppress the pirates in the Yanshan Mountains near Niushenmen in Taizhou Prefecture. Upon arriving at the mountains, the military and police engaged in a fierce battle with the pirates.</p>
<p>Many Bandits Killed: After the 6th Regiment of the Security Force and the 2nd Brigade of the Water Police jointly engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits, the pirate leader, Wang Daoshou, a well-known Taizhou bandit, resisted desperately. After several days of suppression, many bandits were killed. In the end, the pirates, unable to resist, fled in disarray. However, the bandit leader had already fled after hearing the news.</p>
<p>All Rescued: After the pirates fled, the Security Force rescued all thirty-plus passengers and crew members of the Xin Hai Men steamer. In addition to dispatching police to continue the pursuit, the rescued passengers and crew were sent back to Ningbo. They passed Haimen on the 15th of this month and arrived in Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>Mao Li Nearly Hijacked</h3>
<p>Dinghai Water Police Seize Pirates</p>
<p>Steamer Expected to Arrive Today</p>
<p>The Mao Li Steamer Company, located at No. 4 Hengxin Lane, Nan Shi Wai Ma Lu, operates the Mao Li steamer, which departs from Shanghai every Thursday for Dinghai, Shipu, Huangyan, and other locations. The steamer departed from Shanghai last Thursday (the 13th) at 5 PM, carrying cargo and passengers to the aforementioned ports. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in Shanghai that the steamer had seized bandits and nearly suffered a hijacking in Dinghai. Last night, a reporter went to the company to inquire and was informed by Mr. Miao of the company that the Mao Li steamer departed from Shanghai last Thursday and arrived in Dinghai at noon the next day (the 14th). When the water patrol team boarded the ship for inspection, they discovered bandits among the passengers (the exact number is unconfirmed) and a pistol, which they took away for interrogation. This inspection inevitably delayed the steamer's schedule. Therefore, after leaving Shipu, it went to Huangyan and then returned to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. As for the details, they will only be known after the steamer arrives this morning.</p>
<h3>Streetcar Door Closures Should Prevent Passenger Injuries</h3>
<p>Chinese Ratepayers' Association Requests Attention from the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, According to a letter from Mr. Zhang Yu Xiang, 'Upon investigation, it has been customary for streetcar operators to close the doors only after passengers have boarded the streetcar. Recently, due to overcrowding, streetcar operators have been careless, often closing the doors while passengers are still boarding. If a passenger is not careful, their fingers may be pinched, resulting in minor skin injuries or serious bleeding and broken fingers. A merchant suffered this harm himself a week ago. Afterwards, he reflected on his humble background and realized that his livelihood depends entirely on the income from his ten fingers to support himself. If they were to be crushed off, what would his family rely on? The pain and reflection are still frightening. Considering that riding streetcars is unavoidable for a large part of society, if the door closure procedures are not improved, I fear that more than one person will follow in the merchant's footsteps. Now, I propose the following measures: (1) Notify the streetcar authorities to leave a gap where passengers place their hands when boarding to prevent finger pinching or to install rubber bands. (2) The streetcar operator should sound the whistle once before closing the door and twice when starting the streetcar to provide a warning to notify passengers to be prepared. If the above two measures are deemed acceptable, I request that your association consult with the Public Works Department to notify the streetcar authorities to make improvements as soon as possible to prevent accidents and ensure safety,' etc., have been received. Accordingly, we respectfully request your department to instruct the streetcar company to earnestly prevent this behavior that can injure people's hands and feet. To this end, we address this to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Water Connection Fees for Building Construction in the City Center</h3>
<p>Lu Genquan Sues Tan Heng for Damaging Reputation</p>
<p>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Does Not Charge Fees</p>
<p>Lu Genquan, the owner of Lu Gen Ji Construction Company on Ningbo Road, recently hired lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Jiang Chiping to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against Tan Heng, an engineer at Heng Yao Construction Real Estate Company at No. 1 Suzhou Road, for damaging his reputation and violating Article 330 of the Criminal Code. The main points of the lawsuit are as follows: Lu Genquan has been operating Lu Gen Ji Construction Company in Shanghai for many years and has a good reputation. On August 15th of this year, he contracted to build a Western-style residence on Jiangwan Zhengde Road, downtown, as planned by the defendant. Engineer Tan introduced the owner, Yu Jinyu, to Lu, and they signed a construction contract. However, on September 1st, owner Yu Jinyu suddenly notified the workers on site that all construction work must be stopped before the tap water is connected. Upon receiving the notice, Lu immediately sent a letter to Heng Yao Company the next day, stating that the owner should be responsible for the delay in the completion date. Unexpectedly, Heng Yao Company suddenly sent a letter asking about the 230 yuan water installation fee. Lu was baffled and did not reply. Later, another letter was sent urging him to inquire. Lu, not understanding the defendant's intention, replied that he would ask the owner for the fee after receiving the official receipt. However, on November 8th, Lu suddenly received Order No. 654 from the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Bank Trust Real Estate Stock had complained that Zhabei Water and Electricity Company required the owner to pay a 270 yuan water connection fee and ordered him to come to the bureau for questioning. Lu complied and, after speaking with Director Xu Peihuang, learned that Tan Heng had fabricated facts, impersonated Lu's name, falsely claimed that Zhabei Water and Electricity Company required a water connection fee of over 200 yuan, and attempted to defraud the owner, Yu Jinyu. At that time, Lu immediately denied that this had happened. However, the Public Utilities Bureau stated that if Lu did not thoroughly clarify the truth, his business license would be revoked. Lu Genquan stated that the water connection issue was discussed once on September 3rd by the owner, Tan Heng, and the plaintiff at the defendant's company. At that time, the plaintiff also stated that he did not know whether a fee was required for water connection and that he should inquire with Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to find out. Therefore, on the 4th of the same month, he entrusted Zhou Baolin, the owner of Chongxingchang Water and Electricity Company, which specializes in water and electricity installation, to inquire with Zhabei Water and Electricity Company on his behalf. He was informed that no fee was required, and the plaintiff immediately instructed Zhou Baolin to inform the defendant that no fee was required for water connection. Now, the defendant has used fraudulent means to spread rumors to Yu Jinyu, causing Yu to mistakenly believe and order the workers on site to stop all construction work to damage the plaintiff's reputation. There is no doubt that the plaintiff has never made such a request, so what grounds does the defendant have to spread rumors in front of Yu to have the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau impose administrative sanctions on the plaintiff and damage his reputation? How can he remain silent? Therefore, he is filing a lawsuit according to law, requesting that the defendant Tan Heng be summoned to court and punished according to law, and requesting that the defendant be ordered to publish the entire verdict in the newspaper to restore the plaintiff's reputation." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the Fifth Criminal Court summoned the parties for questioning. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Lu Genquan, and his agents, lawyers Wu and Jiang, explained the above situation and stated that the case was very serious because the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau intended to revoke the plaintiff's business license based on the report. Therefore, in order to maintain his reputation and clarify the truth, the plaintiff had to seek a legal solution. Witness Xu Baolin then testified that he was entrusted by Lu to inquire with Zhabei Yongdian Company and that no fee was required for water connection and that he had informed Tan Heng. The court adjourned the case for seven days due to the defendant's absence and ordered the plaintiff to summon the defendant to court for further verification.</p>
<h3>Robbery with Gunfire Occurs in Broad Daylight on Dalin Road</h3>
<p>Concerns Over Plundered Concubine and Monk</p>
<p>Patrol Leader He Apprehends Two Robbers</p>
<p>The home of Jiang and Shang, a cement merchant residing at No. 1, Alley 18, Dalin Road, has accumulated some savings in recent years, making him a target for robbers. Yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, five robbers suddenly arrived. One robber wore a blue cloth short coat, one wore a Mackinaw coat, one wore a black short coat, and one wore a serge long gown. All spoke with a local accent. The robbers saw a female customer surnamed Huang enter through the back door and immediately rushed inside. One robber guarded the door as a lookout. Among the four robbers, the one wearing the blue cloth short coat drew a gun and monitored the men and women inside the house. The three robbers went upstairs to search and plunder, taking away Central Bank banknotes worth $1,110, $12 in silver coins, a gold bracelet, a beaded bracelet, a gold pin, a pair of gold silk earrings, two gold rings, and a gold ear pick. After the robbery, the robbers attempted to flee in all directions. At that time, the victim Jiang and Shang had reported to the 26th Precinct police. The police immediately reported by telegraph to the patrol leader Zhang Yaodong of the Sanguantang Police Station, who immediately reported by telephone to West Gate Branch Bureau Chief Li. Patrol teams were immediately dispatched under Patrol Leader He Xixing, leading police officers Zhang Yao and Zhang Yanong. Meanwhile, Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda, stationed at the bureau, led all detectives to pursue the robbers separately. At 3:05 PM, Patrol Leader He and police officers Zhang Yao and Zhang Yanong spotted two suspicious individuals ahead and bravely pursued them. Seeing the police following them, the robbers immediately fired several shots, which missed. However, Patrol Leader He and others continued to bravely advance and apprehended the two robbers at the intersection of Fang Xie Road and Tai An Street (i.e., the back gate of the Cui Yuan Pawnshop on Zhonghua Road). A 6-inch Browning pistol was found on the robber Han Huaicheng, and a 4-inch Browning pistol and six bullets were found next to the robber You Changfu. The other three robbers escaped without a trace. The apprehended robbers, Han Huaicheng and You Changfu, as well as the pistols and bullets, were taken to the West Gate Branch Bureau. After a brief interrogation by Branch Bureau Chief Li, they were handed over to Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda for interrogation of their accomplices. When Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda dispatched detectives, they apprehended two male and female suspects in the French Concession and took them to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over Embezzled Compensation in the Da De Steamer Tragedy</h3>
<p>Plaintiff is a Simple Rural Farmer</p>
<p>Bian Jialu Presents Evidence of Payment</p>
<p>Ping Laiyin, a native of Baipu Township, Nantong, transported yellow sprouts to Shanghai for sale in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic. After finishing his business, he boarded the Da De steamer of the Da Da Company to return home. Unfortunately, the steamer caught fire and burned midway, resulting in the deaths of most of the passengers. Ping also perished at the age of 30. Later, the families of the victims entrusted the Zhenwei Law Firm, composed of lawyers Bian Jialu, Huang Zengjie, and Xu Zai, to negotiate with the Da Da Company for compensation. After being entrusted, the law firm organized the Da De Steamer Disaster Victims' Families Committee to conduct negotiations. Ping's elder brother, Ping Laiyou, learned of this in his hometown and sent a letter to the Zhenwei Law Firm, requesting to register and join. As a result of the negotiations, the Chinese Jisheng Association intervened and received $3,040 from the Da Da Company, which was distributed by the Zhenwei Law Firm to the families of the victims to settle the case. More than two years have passed since then. Recently, Ping Laiyou, the elder brother of Ping Laiyin, claimed that the compensation received did not match the total amount and entrusted lawyers Xia Zukun, Xue Jiaqi, and Qian Ying to negotiate with Bian Jialu. The Shanghai Bar Association also convened both parties for mediation without resolution. Ping then entrusted his cousin, Han Jingquan, the owner of the Xinshun Yuan stove shop at No. 8 Wu Jia Lane, South Qianjia Tang, Huanlong Road, French Concession, to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing lawyer Bian Jialu of forgery and embezzlement of compensation, requesting an investigation and also filing a civil lawsuit to recover the $3,040 compensation. The court accepted the lawsuit and summoned the parties once, but the hearing was postponed because the plaintiff's agent, Han Jingquan, was also listed as a plaintiff, which was procedurally incorrect. The court ordered the plaintiff, Ping Laiyou, to appear in court for questioning. This has already been reported in the previous newspapers. However, according to the defendant's defense, this case was handled by lawyer Huang Zengjie. Initially, the agency negotiated with the Da Da Company, but without success, and the process was suspended. Later, the families of the victims went to the Da Da Company themselves and negotiated for days, and the secretary of the board of directors of the Da Da Company, Wang Yinqiao, introduced the Chinese Jisheng Association to provide relief funds and dismissed the families to return home. The representatives of the families of the victims also signed a settlement agreement with the Da Da Company. The contract was only signed and sealed by lawyer Huang Zengjie as proof. Afterwards, the funds were received and distributed to the families for collection. Ping Laiyou entrusted lawyer Xia Zukun to send his clerk, Wang Xueming, to collect the funds on his behalf in May of the 21st year of the Republic. The case was heard again the day before yesterday by Judge Xiong Huiping and the Second Criminal Court, who summoned both parties and witnesses for trial. The plaintiff, Ping Laiyou, was dressed in coarse clothes, completely a simple rural farmer, and arrived at court with his agent lawyer. The judge asked him what he was accusing him of, but Ping's language was unintelligible and his answers were irrelevant. His agent lawyer then stated the plaintiff's intent to sue. The defendant, Bian Jialu, presented various evidentiary documents to the court. Witness Wang Xueming was summoned to court and denied collecting Ping Laiyin's compensation on his behalf. The judge showed him a receipt for $40, but Wang claimed that he had not signed such a receipt. The judge asked Bian Jialu who wrote this receipt, and Bian replied that it was written by the law firm's clerk, Qin Zemin, who is now also a lawyer. The judge then summoned lawyer Huang Zengjie as a witness, but he did not appear. The court then adjourned the case for the 21st day for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Murder by Scissors Yesterday Autopsied</h3>
<p>Police Vigorously Apprehending the Fugitive Murderer</p>
<p>Rongchangxiang Western-style Clothing Store at No. 174 Yongji Lane, Tangshan Road, is opened by Ningbo native Shu Rongzhang. Around 9 AM on the 16th of this month, the store's employees, Zou Huibao (27 years old) and Chen Qifu (21 years old), both from Ningbo, suddenly had a disagreement during breakfast. Zou suddenly grabbed a pair of sharp scissors used for tailoring Western-style clothes and threw them at Chen, hitting him in the waist and penetrating about an inch. Blood gushed out, and Chen immediately fell to the ground. Zou, frightened by the sight, ordered another employee, Zhou Xingbiao, to hire a rickshaw to take Chen to the hospital for treatment. Zou walked alongside the rickshaw. However, on the way to East Xihua Road, Zou saw that Chen's injuries were worsening and immediately abandoned him and fled. The rickshaw puller looked back and saw that he was gone, so he took the injured Chen back to the store. However, Chen had already died. The store then reported to the nearby police station, which in turn reported to the Huishan Police Station. Detectives were ordered to investigate and the body was taken to the Ferren Road Autopsy Center. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Local Court, along with medical examiners Wei and Zhang, and court clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the center to examine the body. Zhou Xingbiao testified that he was 23 years old, from Ningbo, and that yesterday morning, he, Zou, and Chen were having breakfast at the store. Chen dipped youtiao (fried dough sticks) into the soy sauce bowl as he ate, and Zou criticized him for being unhygienic. The two then had an argument and began to fight each other. He persuaded them to stop. Zou saw that Chen was still muttering and cursing, so he grabbed a pair of scissors from the workbench and threw them at him, causing the incident. At the time, the deceased was wearing a wool shirt, a short shirt, and a padded jacket. Store owner Shu Rongzhang testified that he was out buying vegetables at the time and did not know what had happened. Chen Ji, the deceased's uncle, also testified. Guo then ordered that the deceased, Chen Qifu, male, had died from being stabbed in the chest with scissors before death.

<h3>Apprentice Burned to Death by Gasoline</h3>
<p>Burns Flesh; Fire Poisons Heart</p>
<p>Playful Apprentice Already Indicted</p>
<p>Yang Ahua, a 16-year-old from Ningbo, was an apprentice at the Yuanheng Automobile Repair Company at No. 744, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. Around 2 PM on the 12th of this month, while he was working, he was playfully joking with his fellow apprentice and senior apprentice, Wang Xiaolong (18 years old, from Pudong), causing Yang to fall into a porcelain basin full of gasoline. Yang's clothes were covered in gasoline. Yang did not think much of it and continued to work with the blowtorch he was holding. Because the left sleeve of his shirt was also covered in gasoline, it was ignited by the heat, and Yang's clothes caught fire and burned his flesh. After being rescued, he was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Ghisi. He died in the hospital the next morning due to fire poisoning and ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Autopsy Center, and Wang Xiaolong, who was playfully joking with him, was taken into custody for investigation. The case was later reported to the Special No. 2 Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren examined the body and confirmed that the deceased had died from burns and ordered the senior apprentice, Yang Guilin, to arrange for burial. The day before yesterday, the police brought witness Chen Xien (49 years old, from Tongzhou) to court and escorted Wang to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted the trial. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the facts of the case and indicted Wang for negligent homicide. The court questioned the defendant, Wang Xiaolong, and the witness, Chen Xien, in detail and adjourned the case for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Shanghai North Station to Sell Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Third Class Tickets</h3>
<p>Adding a New Type of Third Class B Ticket</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration recently received letters from passengers stating that the Shanghai North Station only had one window for selling Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo third class tickets, causing delays in purchasing tickets. They requested improvements. After the bureau instructed the Transportation Department to deliberate, it was decided that the number of third-class passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line at Shanghai North Station is not currently large, with about four to five hundred tickets sold daily. However, during the spring months of March and April, the number of tourists increases suddenly, making the third-class ticket window seem crowded. To prepare for this eventuality, it has been decided to add a type of Third Class B ticket and prepare a ticket booth, date stamper, and printer for use when necessary, to improve passenger convenience.</p>

<h3>### Wang Xingsheng and Others Sue Datong Correspondence School for Fraud</h3>
<p>Datong Denies Having These Two Students</p>
<p>Simultaneously Counter-suing and Requesting Detention</p>
<p>丨The Court Still Needs to Investigate and Reschedule the Hearing丨</p>
<p>The Datong Trust Bank Correspondence School at 128 Museum Road was newly established this spring, with a board of directors consisting of prominent Shanghai business figures such as Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Xu Qianlin, and Gu Xinyi, with Lu Yaoming as the principal, Sun Bingzhong as the chief of affairs, and Zhang Zongzai as the head of teaching. After registering with the Shanghai Education Bureau, the school began advertising for students, promising graduation in six months and collecting tuition fees from each student. According to the prescribed curriculum, lectures, assignments, and other materials were issued. All teaching and inquiries were handled by correspondence. In August of this year, Wang Xingsheng and Wang Xinnan each sent letters to the school's directors, stating that they were correspondence students who had registered and paid fees on February 10th, holding receipts issued by Sun Bingzhong. Principal Lu had also successively sent them more than thirty mimeographed lectures and one assignment paper, stating that the mimeographed lectures were temporary and would be replaced with printed ones in the future. However, after waiting for a long time, there was no replacement. They sent letters urging the school to provide printed lectures, but to no avail. They said that this situation appeared to be fraudulent, and that they were questioning the school about it. They also submitted a report to the Municipal Education Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation. After receiving the letters, the directors investigated with the school authorities, but Lu Yaoming and others denied that the Wangs were correspondence students. Lu even sent a letter to the address written in the Wangs' letter, "Zhangjia Lane, West Gate, Baoshan County," to investigate, but</p>
<p>There Was No Such Person. They concluded that the actions of the two Wangs were deliberately intended to damage the school's reputation and filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government. After several court hearings by the county's trial officer, the defendants were never summoned, making it difficult to proceed. They then petitioned the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office to issue an arrest warrant. In fact, the two Wangs were hiding at sea and continued to spread letters unfavorable to the school last month to vent their anger. Lu Yaoming, because the Baoshan County Government had petitioned the High Court for an arrest warrant, also published notices in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers to arrest the two Wangs. On the 24th of last month, the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that Wang Xinnan was hiding in the French Concession and requested assistance from the French police to</p>
<p>Arrest Xinnan. Under interrogation by the Second Special District Court, he was granted bail pending trial. After Xinnan was released on bail, he and Xingsheng jointly hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation of fraud against Lu Yaoming in the First Special District Court, recounting that they had registered and paid fees at the correspondence school on February 10th and that they had received mimeographed lectures from the school, which initially stated that they would be replaced with printed ones in the future, but this had not happened. Finally, they stated that Lu Yaoming's publication in the newspaper denying that they were students of the school was an attempt to defraud them of their money and requested that he be investigated according to the law. Lu also appointed lawyer Yuan Yangan to submit a defense, arguing that (1) the school began enrolling students on March 5th of this year, and the Wangs said they registered on February 10th,</p>
<p>Which Was Inconsistent With the Timeline. (2) All students who paid tuition were given receipts, admission certificates, and registration numbers, but the Wangs had none of these documents. (3) The lectures held by Wang Xingsheng may have come from the printing office or from someone else. These three points proved that the Wangs were not Datong students. He also stated that the Wangs had fabricated facts and falsely claimed to be students and filed a counter-suit, demanding that they be punished for false accusation. He further Zheng Zhang stated that they had been approved by the Jiangsu High Court for a long time and had not been captured. Now that they had filed a lawsuit, he requested</p>
<p>Prompt Detention, so that the Baoshan County Government could be informed and send someone to the court to bring them in. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court opened a hearing before Judge Yinghua. The plaintiff, Wang Xingsheng, and his representative lawyer were present. The defendant, Lu Yaoming, and his witness, Sun Bingzhong, and his defense lawyer, Yuan Yangan, were also present. First, Wang Xingsheng stated the facts of the lawsuit and presented the receipt for tuition fees issued by Sun Bingzhong and the mimeographed lectures and assignment papers as evidence to prove that he was indeed a Datong student, arguing that if he was not a correspondence student of the school, how could he have these items? However, the defendant Lu Yaoming firmly denied this, claiming that there were no Wangs among the school's students. The judge, recognizing the seriousness of the case, ordered both parties to leave after explaining that the case still needed to be investigated and that they would be notified of the rescheduled hearing date.</p>
<h3>Sassoon Discusses Remedies for Silver Issues</h3>
<p>Reuters Shanghai, 18th - Sir Victor Sassoon, Chairman of E.D. Sassoon &amp; Co., Ltd., made the following remarks to a Reuters reporter today regarding the silver market. When asked for his opinion on how to remedy the current silver crisis, Sir Sassoon replied that he knows that the United States now understands that raising the price of silver will not help U.S. trade with China, because the amount of silver that China can export is relatively small. Therefore, imports to China depend on exports from China. However, since U.S. monetary policy requires a large accumulation of silver, the United States must buy it from abroad. The problem seems to be finding a way for the United States to obtain the silver it needs without raising the price of silver excessively, which would harm China's interests. He believes that since the United States is prepared to buy silver at a price higher than the current silver price, it may as well contact the Indian government to recover all the silver that India purchased from the United States after the war at the original price. In this way, the surplus silver in the Indian government's treasury can be transferred to the U.S. government's treasury. At the same time, the U.S. government can make a clear statement that it is not prepared to buy existing silver, but is willing to enter into contracts with silver mines to buy newly mined silver. If what the U.S. government buys matches the output of the mines, and the price it is prepared to pay makes silver mining profitable, then the United States will certainly be able to obtain a large amount of silver without disrupting the world market. As world prices rise and Chinese exports fetch higher prices, the rise in silver prices will naturally not cause difficulties. However, the rise in silver prices must be in line with the rise in Chinese export prices. He believes that this suggestion can be adopted, so that the United States can increase its silver reserves, and China can avoid the same financial panic that the United States has to deal with.</p>

<h3>Wang Liansheng and Others Acquitted in a Copper Coin Murder Case</h3>
<p>A gangster, Wang Axiong, argued with the Shuntai Cigarette Paper Shop at 132 Gansidong Road in the French Concession around September 10th over exchanging a double mill coin for a single copper coin. Gao Anjun, a Shandong native who used to be Police Officer No. 78 in the French Concession, happened to be hanging out in the store, intervened, and slapped Wang, driving him away. Wang then left in anger. On the 17th of the same month, Wang gathered a gang with weapons to take revenge on Gao. At 1:00 p.m., he met Gao in front of the Xinshangye Tai Meat Shop at 85 Remi Road and shot him dead. Later, the police investigated the murderer. It was discovered on October 21st that someone was extorting 1,000 yuan from the Shuntai Cigarette Paper Shop to settle with the family of the deceased. After the shop reported this to the French police, they found that Wang Liansheng, also known as Wang Daodao, and Shao Liangeng, accomplices in the case, had fled to Hankou after the incident and recently sneaked back to Shanghai, hiding in the Dongfang Hotel on Sanma Road. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Wang and Shao and hand them over to the Second Special Court. The French Concession police lawyer filed charges of murder and extortion. The deceased's wife, Gao Hu, also filed an incidental civil suit. The defendants hired lawyers Ehsen and Wang Shizong to defend them, denying involvement in the murder. The trial judge, Cao Jun, considered it a major case involving human life, sought details, held repeated hearings, summoned various witnesses for questioning, and declared the debate closed, scheduling the sentencing. This was reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the scheduled sentencing date. At 2:30 p.m., Judge Cao presided over Criminal Court One and ordered the two defendants to be brought to court. Wang Liansheng and Shao Liangeng were acquitted, and the incidental civil suit was dismissed. The defendants were temporarily held in the detention center during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Ancient Military Strategies Published</h3>
<p>Modern military books are constantly evolving, and there are many works. However, in terms of research on military strategy, in addition to ancient military methods that can be explored, there are few specialized books. Ancient military methods vary with the times and weapons, and researchers often find it difficult to choose and discard. Mr. Xin, in view of this, compiled the book "Ancient Military Strategies" based on his research. All ancient military strategists' subtle points on military theory that do not lose their timeliness are cited extensively and included as much as possible. The book is indeed a compilation of the great achievements of ancient military strategists and brings together the mysteries of ancient military strategists. Mastering this book will enable one to win battles and become a famous general. At a time when national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, not only military strategists should have this book in their hands, but people throughout the country must also strive to read it quickly. The book is now published by the Military Book Publishing House and sells for 30 cents.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Cares About Local Security</h3>
<p>Yesterday, They Sent a Letter to the Military and Political Authorities to Ban Vagrants</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai received a letter from fellow villagers Tang Zuxiang and others stating that vagrants in Jiangbei were traveling in groups in the Yinzhou area, extorting money from household to household. Considering this was related to local security, they sent a letter to the Ningbo Zhejiang Provincial Security Second Division, Yinxian County Government, and Yinxian Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating that, according to a letter from their members Tang Zuxiang and others, they had recently heard that vagrants in Jiangbei were rampant in places such as Mahu in Yinxi, traveling in groups during the day, extorting money from household to household, and occupying temples at night, wantonly damaging them. If one complies with their demands, their greed is insatiable; if one does not comply, the harassment is even worse. The villagers have suffered deeply and have no way to complain. The cause of the Bai Liangqiao melee lies in this. During the winter defense period, if they are not quickly banned, not only is security worrying, but the trouble may spread and become difficult to control. Therefore, they urged the association to forward their request to the Security Department, Yinxian County Government, Public Security Bureau, and other military and political agencies to promptly ban them. Those who are law-abiding and have jobs should be ordered to quickly find local guarantors to sign a guarantee. Those who have no guarantors or jobs should be ordered to leave the country and not stay, in order to ensure the safety of the villagers and stabilize the area. It was also mentioned that the vagrants in Jiangbei traveling in groups and extorting money seriously hindered security. During this winter defense, the situation is particularly important. Tang's suggestion that those who have jobs should find guarantors to sign a guarantee and that those who have no jobs should be ordered to leave the country is essential. In light of the aforementioned situation, they urgently asked the Director (County Chief, Bureau Chief) to order the affiliated public security agencies to strictly ban them and take appropriate precautions to stabilize the area. They also asked to be informed of the progress.</p>

The East China Sea and Taiwan Strait are overcast with rain, and the northeast monsoon is quite strong. Also, before 3:00 PM yesterday, within the previous 24 hours, the temperature in this city was: maximum 52.7, minimum 47.5. On the same day last year: maximum 58.1, minimum 28.2.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing at the behest of the parties involved. The manager of the British firm, Messrs. Butterfield &amp; Swire, has stated that upon reading the December 18th issue of the (Shen Bao), they saw the article "Thirty-One Cases of Red Pill Raw Materials Seized on Ningbo Ship." The article stated that thirty cases of red pill raw materials were purchased from Butterfield &amp; Swire, which is quite surprising. Upon investigation, this firm sold to a Mr. Chen on December 15th an item that is a type of milk powder, with the English name "National Milk Sugar," which is not a raw material for red pills and contains no toxic substances. It is shipped from the United States to China and has a formal customs permit, and is not a prohibited item. The report's statements are entirely inconsistent with the facts. We respectfully request that you correct the record and prevent the spread of misinformation, thus upholding journalistic integrity. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao Editor-in-Chief, Lawyer Xi Ya Fu, December 18th.</p>
<p>Note: This newspaper stated yesterday that the goods were "entrusted to our shipowner Mr. Chen by a certain Mr. Fang, a customer within Butterfield &amp; Swire on Haimen Road in this city." There was no mention of "purchased from Butterfield &amp; Swire." This is hereby clarified.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Resolutions from the National Vocational Education Conference (Part 1)</h3>
<p>On the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, the Ministry of Education, taking advantage of the National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Achievement Exhibition held in Beijing, convened a National Vocational Education Discussion Conference, bringing together administrative personnel in charge of vocational education from the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, and inviting many vocational education experts to Beijing. All conference proceedings have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. The conference discussed and resolved fourteen cases, which were handled by the Ministry of Education separately. Now, the Ministry of Education has organized the full text of the resolutions, which is recorded below for the reference of readers:</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Vocational Education Discussion Conference</p>
<p>Case 1: Regarding Vocational Education Administrative Personnel</p>
<p>The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should establish full-time positions for personnel to handle and inspect vocational education. (Proposed by the Ministry of Education)</p>
<p>Special funds and personnel should be allocated for vocational school career guidance and promotion to ensure effective implementation. (Proposed by the Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education)</p>
<p>Resolved:</p>
<p>(1) Within the department in charge of school education, there must be at least one full-time staff member each to handle vocational education and career guidance.</p>
<p>(2) One or two supervisors or instructors must be designated, and specialized talent must be hired on a temporary basis to be responsible for inspecting vocational schools at all levels.</p>
<p>For the above two measures, please order the education departments and bureaus of each province and city to implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Case 2: Regarding Vocational Education Funding</p>
<p>How should provinces and cities implement the standards set by the Ministry for the establishment and funding of secondary schools? (Proposed by the Ministry of Education)</p>
<p>The standard for the allocation of funds for promoting vocational education should be at least 30% of the funding for secondary education.</p>
<p>(5) If it is not possible to meet the standard as scheduled, please consider the facts and make appropriate adjustments. (Proposed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education)</p>
<p>Resolved:</p>
<p>(1) Provinces and cities that already have predetermined plans to implement the standards set by the Ministry year by year, and have been approved by the Ministry, should earnestly promote them within the specified time limit.</p>
<p>(2) Provinces and cities that do not yet have predetermined plans to implement the standards set by the Ministry should formulate them as soon as possible, submit them to the Ministry for approval, and implement them accordingly.</p>
<p>(3) When allocating new funding to vocational schools, provinces and cities should prioritize improving the equipment of existing vocational schools, followed by establishing new vocational schools.</p>
<p>(4) If provinces and cities have special difficulties, and the Ministry of Education verifies that they are true, the date for completing the standards may be extended appropriately, but limited to one or two years.</p>
<p>(5) When provinces and cities implement the standards set by the Ministry, the Ministry of Education will check the degree of achievement or special difficulties and provide subsidies as appropriate.</p>
<p>(6) Please recommend that the central government allocate 3 to 5 million yuan annually from the 24th year onwards to subsidize vocational education in various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Case 3: Regarding Vocational Education Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>How should the implementation of laws and regulations on vocational education be supervised and promoted? What suggestions do you have? (Proposed by the Ministry of Education)</p>
<p>Please order each province and city to pay special attention to agricultural teaching and practice in rural teachers' schools and rural primary schools to promote agricultural education. (Proposed by the Fujian Provincial Department of Education)</p>
<p>It is proposed to reduce the financial burden on vocational school students and clearly define the amount of fees paid by vocational school students. (Proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education)</p>
<p>The specialization of junior vocational schools should be as simple as possible to facilitate implementation and practical application. (Proposed by the Anhui Provincial Department of Education)</p>
<p>Resolved:</p>
<p>(1) It is hoped that provinces and cities will supervise the implementation of the provisions in the vocational education laws and regulations regarding the establishment of departments, funding, equipment, and practice.</p>
<p>(2) Existing middle schools that still have vocational departments may continue to exist as a type of experimental school if they already have considerable equipment, teachers, and achievements, and have been specially approved by the Ministry of Education. Existing junior vocational schools that have been converted from junior middle schools and must in fact retain junior middle school classes, and have been approved by the Ministry of Education, may be temporarily allowed to have affiliated junior middle school classes. As for the increase of agricultural subjects in rural normal schools and the increase of education subjects in junior vocational schools, which is a change to a small part of the curriculum, flexibility should naturally be granted.</p>
<p>(3) The establishment of vocational schools should be based on a single department as a principle. Departments of the same nature can establish two or more departments. If the school's economic, talent, and equipment aspects all have the possibility of setting up multiple departments, and there is in fact a need to set them up, and it has been approved by the Ministry of Education, then it may be established.</p>
<p>(4) Vocational school students should still pay fees in accordance with the regulations. It is hoped that provinces and cities will find ways to reward or subsidize private vocational schools with excellent achievements. Private vocational schools that have not received public subsidies may be allowed to be flexible, with the approval of the competent educational administrative authority, if the fees paid by students exceed the number specified in the regulations.</p>
<p>Case 4: Regarding the Establishment of Short-Term Training Courses Affiliated with Senior Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Please allow senior vocational schools to establish special vocational departments, following the example of the special normal departments affiliated with normal schools (Proposed by the Fujian Provincial Department of Education). Please order the provinces and cities to establish agricultural instructor training classes as soon as possible to relieve rural areas and enrich production (Proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education). Simple vocational schools should be established in the capital and various provinces and cities (Proposed by the representative of Henan Province).</p>
<p>Vocational schools should combine junior and senior levels to suit the national conditions of our country, so as to improve students' technical ability and cultivate them into sound professional talents (Proposed by Nanjing City).</p>
<p>All major middle schools and primary schools above the sixth grade should have affiliated vocational supplementary schools or vocational supplementary classes.</p>
<p>More district and town vocational supplementary schools should be established in each city and county to improve farmers' production knowledge and skills. (Proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education)</p>
<p>Resolved:</p>
<p>1. Provinces and cities may, in view of the needs of the locality and for the sake of finding employment for middle school graduates, establish short-term vocational training courses within senior vocational schools. However, it is not appropriate to establish agricultural and industrial departments. Detailed measures should be separately formulated and announced by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>2. The conference recommends that the Ministry of Education consult with various ministries and commissions to order the agencies under their jurisdiction in each province and city to consult with the local competent educational administrative authorities to handle short-term training courses or workshops when they are needed.</p>
<p>3. Provinces and cities should consult with the local construction bureaus, finance bureaus, and other agencies to handle the establishment of vocational schools before deciding to establish departments.</p>
<p>4. It is appropriate for vocational schools to combine junior and senior levels.</p>
<p>Case 5: Regarding the Establishment and Reorganization of Departments in Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Provinces and cities should, based on the industrial conditions and the types of talents needed in the industry in their own provinces and cities, reorganize the existing vocational schools' departments and determine the types of departments to be established in the future. (Proposed by the Ministry of Education)</p>
<p>Please order the education departments of each province to investigate the quantity and nature of vocational needs in their respective important regions, in order to create standards for vocational talent cultivation (Proposed by Cheng Zhenji and He Qingru).</p>
<p>Resolved: The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should quickly establish a vocational education design committee to be responsible for investigation, research, and promotion. Its tasks are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Investigate the industrial conditions, types of occupations, and the talents needed by all sectors of society in the province and city.</p>
<p>2. For the existing public and private vocational schools' departments in each province and city, a detailed investigation should be conducted to determine whether there are any biases or deficiencies, whether they correspond to the needs, and whether the graduates of each department are conveniently employed. If the established subjects do not correspond to the needs, how should reasonable control be implemented and other departments be reorganized?</p>
<p>3. For the future addition of departments to public and private vocational schools, a concrete plan should be formulated and implemented in stages.</p>
<p>4. Provinces and cities should formulate the following three standards when promoting vocational education in the future, design, and promote them:</p>
<p>(1) Establish more vocational supplementary schools and junior vocational schools.</p>
<p>(2) The establishment of senior vocational schools should be based on a single industry and one school for each industry as a principle.</p>
<p>(3) The establishment of commercial vocational schools must be limited.</p>
<h3>Chiang and Liu to Arrive in Manila the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chinese Representatives Sent to Congratulate Philippine University President on Inauguration</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) Chiang Menglin and Liu Zhanen previously traveled to the Philippines on the Jefferson liner to attend the Far East Higher Education Conference. The liner was wrecked in Hong Kong, and they changed to the Zhangde liner. They are expected to arrive in Manila on the 21st. According to Manila reports, the President of the University of the Philippines was inaugurated on the 17th. Our Consul General to the Philippines, Deng Zongying, represented our side in attending and delivering a congratulatory message. (Nanjing, 18th) Chiang Menglin and Liu Zhanen left Hong Kong on the Zhangde liner on the 18th to attend the East Asian Higher Education Conference. Accompanied by Lingnan University professors Chen Rongjie and Xu Gantang.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Cooperates with China Academic Work Advisory Office</h3>
<p>When China planned to establish a National Academic Work Advisory Office, it wanted to establish a branch office in Geneva. Later, due to limited funding, only one office was established domestically. Regarding overseas investigations and introductions, the Ministry of Education previously sent letters to ambassadors abroad, requesting them to assist in the investigation and other work of the National Academic Work Advisory Office. Recently, the Advisory Office also translated the organization regulations and work plan of the office into a general report in French, and sent it to groups similar to the advisory office in the League of Nations, hoping to obtain cooperation from like-minded organizations. The League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation resolved to establish an Academic Work Advisory Office and first organize a small committee to collect data for consultation. Among the six members of the small committee, there is one Chinese, Yuan Tong. Yuan recently sent a letter to the Ministry of Education reporting the general process of the League of Nations' decision to establish an advisory office and first organize a small committee, saying that detailed information will be presented in person after returning to China from Italy next month. In this situation, China's Academic Work Advisory Office can have more opportunities for assistance and cooperation in the future. In addition, the National Academic Work Advisory Office has issued more than 1,300 registration forms for investigation and introduction, and there are currently more than 260 copies that have been completed and submitted. The current situation of matching registered talents with the needs of various parties is being consulted separately, and more than 60 people have more promising prospects. The office is currently consulting separately with the Economic Commission, the Nanchang Office of the Military Council, and other agencies that need talents.</p>
<h3>This City's National Military Training Association Plans to Centralize Military Training Next Year</h3>
<p>Approximately 4,700 Students to Participate Citywide</p>
<p>After the Training Headquarters and the Ministry of Education promulgated the amended student military training measures, from next year onwards, the duration of student military training in high schools and equivalent schools in all provinces and cities will be reduced from the original two years to one year. That is, military training will be received for one year after the start of the first year of high school, and military training will no longer be received in the second year. The shortened year will be made up for by holding centralized training within three months after the end of the second semester of the first year, and all provinces and cities were ordered to implement this from the 20th year. After receiving the order, the National Military Training Committee of this city has drafted a detailed plan for centralized training and submitted it to the Training Headquarters for review. In total, approximately 4,700 military training students in this city will participate in the centralized training next year. The organization of the general team, and the training location has been submitted to the municipal government to contact the racecourse to borrow the field. The nursing training for female students will be held for the first time, and there are many inconveniences in terms of equipment. Jiang has ordered a temporary exemption. Schools participating in centralized military training will no longer hold summer training, but summer training for schools above the specialized level will still be implemented in accordance with the original measures.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan and Others Will Host a Banquet for Student Representatives Who Initiated the National Goods Year</h3>
<p>Education and Business Circles Will Unite and Cooperate</p>
<p>Shanghai national goods industry leaders Wu Zhihao and Fang Yexian, etc., in view of the fact that the 23rd year of the Republic of China is about to end, plan to set another national goods year number for the 24th year of the Republic of China. They previously asked Director Pan of the Education Bureau to host a banquet for enthusiastic people in the education sector at the Coriander Restaurant of a certain school, and asked young students to take on the responsibility of promoting national goods next year. Young students are the most energetic, most promising, and most rational and knowledgeable citizens in the country. In other words, today's young students are truly the outstanding elements of the future revival of China. If next year's national goods movement can be effectively promoted with the full mobilization of students, it will definitely enable national goods to increase production and reduce the record of foreign goods trade deficit. The influence of the enthusiastic appeals of the student community may cause unscrupulous merchants, who strive to invade and sell Japanese goods, to be condemned by their conscience and abandon their actions that harm the interests of the country. This view was highly appreciated by the enthusiastic people in the education sector who were present that day. However, it is hoped that the national goods business community and the education sector will cooperate to help students promote the national goods production movement. Therefore, it was decided that next year would be the Year of National Goods for Students, and Pan Gongzhan, Wu Zhihao, Fang Yexian, Chu Huiseng, Zheng Xigu, Chen Jimin, Lin Kecong, Pan Yangyao, and Ren Jinpin were appointed to formulate rules and plans, and to preside over the expansion and preparation of the initiative. It is now heard that the articles of association, plans, and work outline have been drafted, and Director Pan will use the Shanghai Local Coordination Association on Jing'an Temple Road on the 20th of this month for detailed discussions. As soon as the discussions have yielded results, a preparatory meeting of sponsors will be held on a scheduled date to convene representatives from the education and business sectors.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Students Association in Shanghai Writes to Various Schools Requesting Exemption of Fees for Sichuan Students</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Students Association in Shanghai held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees at the association's address at Huiping Middle School yesterday. Representatives from more than ten schools, including Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Sino-French Industrial College, Jinan University, Guanghua University, Zhonggong University, Huiping University, and Tongji Vocational School, attended. Chairman Wang Qi and recorder Li Ke followed proper procedures and the chairman reported the opening of the meeting, followed by reports from various departments on the progress of their work. After that, the discussion began. The resolutions are as follows: (1) In the name of the students' association, submit a request to the Executive Yuan: 1. Order the Military Affairs Commission to quickly send troops to Sichuan to suppress the Communist bandits, so as to curb the source of chaos and stabilize people's livelihoods. 2. Reorganize Sichuan's finances, and strictly order the Sichuan authorities not to privately manufacture hard and soft currency in the future. 3. Strictly order the Sichuan authorities to abolish all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. (2) In the name of the association, submit a request to the Ministry of Education: 1. Issue a notice to all national universities to exempt Sichuan students from tuition and miscellaneous fees. 2. Request the allocation of funds to subsidize private universities, and exempt Sichuan students from tuition and miscellaneous fees in accordance with the free education policy for Sichuan students in national schools. 3. Issue a notice to all public and private universities to establish student loan departments to provide relief to financially struggling Sichuan students. (3) Send letters to the principals of major middle schools, requesting them to provide practical assistance to the free education movement for Sichuan students, and hoping to exempt Sichuan students from tuition and miscellaneous fees. (4) The association should publish a journal in the near future to serve as a platform for the association to conduct academic research and express opinions. (5) The association will hold a friendship ball game championship for Sichuan student associations from various major middle schools at Jiaotong University during the winter vacation.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Education Delegation Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A delegation of principals from Tianjin municipal elementary schools, organized as the Jiangzhe Education Observation Group, with a total of nine members, led by Liu Jingyu, the first section chief of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, headed south on the 7th of this month. They spent four days in Beijing, visiting the labor exhibition, and the equipment, teaching methods, management, and school administration of various elementary schools. Special attention was paid to vocational and production education. They left Beijing on the 13th to visit Wuxi, passed through Suzhou and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. They stayed at the Huizhong Hotel. Yesterday morning, they visited the municipal government, the municipal education bureau, the Public Concession North District Elementary School and other places. At 7 p.m., they went to Jinling Spring for dinner at the invitation of the Commercial Press. After dinner, they went to the Grand Theatre to watch a play. They will take an early train to Hangzhou this morning, stay for four days, and return to Shanghai. They will not stay any longer and will transfer to Jinan from Beijing to visit before returning to Tianjin. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with the leader of the delegation, Mr. Liu, at the hotel yesterday. According to his account, there are more than 220 municipal and private elementary schools in Tianjin, with approximately 40,000 children enrolled. Excluding private schools, approximately 60% of children are not receiving education. There are a total of 22 provincial, municipal, private, coeducational middle schools. Universities and specialized schools include Nankai University, Beiyang Institute of Technology, Women's Teachers' College, Industrial College, College of Law and Commerce, College of Industry and Commerce, Teachers' College, College of Fisheries, and College of Commerce, totaling eight colleges. The Municipal Education Bureau allocates and subsidizes a total of more than 700,000 yuan for social education expenses throughout the year, adopting self-study guidance methods and paying attention to labor and vocational education. Vocational classes have been established in two elementary schools for experimentation. Although the equipment of each school cannot be said to be perfect, it is getting better year by year, because each school is allocated 50 to 60 yuan of equipment fees per month, which are used exclusively for purchasing educational supplies and references, such as instruments, models, and specimen supplies. The current Education Department has decided on a future policy to restrict and merge existing middle school classes, and expand vocational education. On the one hand, this will enable more school-age children to have the opportunity to attend school, and on the other hand, it will enable students in school to acquire considerable life skills, because most middle school graduates in Tianjin cannot continue their education and feel a sense of unemployment panic.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Strictly Punishes Those Who Extort Money in the Name of Education</h3>
<p>East Asia Elementary School Affairs Director Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>There are no fewer than a thousand private schools in this city. While there are many who are enthusiastic about establishing schools, it is inevitable that there are also those who extort money in the name of education. Therefore, the unfortunate incidents of principals absconding with funds have occurred. Principals such as Cheng Shiyu of Qianchuang Elementary School, Yun Jin of Dajiang Middle School, and Zheng Zhaoyang of Huhua Elementary School have absconded with the tuition and boarding fees paid by students. The municipal education authorities are very angry about this, believing that this trend must not be allowed to continue. In addition to issuing an order from the bureau to strictly ban it, they also sent letters to various courts requesting strict orders for arrest. It is now heard that Zhang Yingjie, the absconding affairs director of East Asia Elementary School, has been arrested and is being detained in the Public Security Bureau, where he is being investigated strictly to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shaolin Impersonates a Professor at Central University</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Sun Zuji, a lawyer representing the initiators of the Universal Education Promotion Association, has filed a lawsuit with the local court against Zhang Shaolin for swindling money from children. It has now been found that Zhang is also impersonating a professor at Central University, swindling people everywhere. His business card states that he is a professor of political science at the College of Law of National Central University, but there is no Zhang Shaolin among the professors at Central University. The university has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and Public Security Bureau requesting investigation.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Orders Elementary Schools to Pay Attention to Preventing Students at Renhui Elementary School from Being Swindled out of Jewelry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued a special order to public and private elementary schools yesterday regarding the incident of students at Renhui Elementary School being swindled out of jewelry: According to the report submitted by Pan Renwei, the principal of Renhui Elementary School, Chai Yongkang, the brother of Chai Xingju, a female student in the first grade of the school, came to the school on the afternoon of December 4th and claimed that his sister Xingju was on her way home from school on the morning of that day when she suddenly met a person claiming to be Xingju's father, who ordered her to accompany him home. He also said that she should take off the gold rings she was wearing on her ears, fearing they might be lost, and wrap them in a handkerchief and hide them in her pocket. However, when she wrapped them in the handkerchief, the swindler took the opportunity to steal them. Xingju was young and ignorant and believed it to be true, and was thus swindled out of a pair of gold rings. The school requests that the school pay attention to the matter. The situation has been reported to the Mongol Road Police Station, and the school has also notified the families of the students to pay attention. Therefore, the city is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and such villains are certainly not few. If precautions are not taken in advance, it is feared that similar incidents will occur in other schools. In view of the above situation, in addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau ordering the police to investigate and arrest them at any time, the schools are hereby ordered to admonish the students and notify their families to pay attention to prevention. This is the order.</p>

It is heard that the content is extremely rich, especially the articles "The Truth About the League of Nations," "The Meaning of Property Rights," "The Principles of Ownership," and "Lawyer Practice," which are all able to create their own ideas and express what previous people have not expressed. The society has also invited professors Wang Qufei, Wang Xiaowen, Wang Hanzhang, Zhou Dingmei, Shi Linzhang, and Ke Zhu to be tutors, and held a banquet for the professors at the Huibin Restaurant on Sanma Road at 7 p.m. on the 14th.</p>

<h3>The Main Player Was Penalized Out, Jiangwan Lost Sadly</h3>
<p>Leading All the Way, Success Failed at the Last Moment</p>
<p>Four to Five, Forty-Three to Forty-Five, Lost by Two Points</p>
<p>Jiangwan met with McCray last night in the Group A competition of the West China YMCA basketball league. Jiangwan performed exceptionally well, and the intensity of the competition was truly rare this season. At the beginning of the first half, McCray took the lead with 4-0 and 6-1. After several fierce battles, Fudan broke out and once held an absolute advantage of 16-8. Subsequently, McCray pressed closely, and the situation became extremely serious. The back-and-forth exchanges made it difficult to determine the victor. At the end of the first half, McCray still trailed by two points, with a score of 23-21. Jiangwan's slight setback was mainly due to Zhou Dayun and Chen Zongqi both being penalized off the court, resulting in a significant loss of vitality. In the second half, the two sides were even closer, with the score fluctuating unpredictably. Jiangwan had twice taken the lead by one point. When the final score reached 43-42, Zhang Jinhua was also penalized off the court for committing four fouls. As a result, McCray seized the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, first tying the score at 43-43. With one minute remaining, McCray's Johnson made a close shot, resulting in Jiangwan suffering a defeat with a score of 45-43, a difference of two points. In another match, Jinan decisively defeated Chi Chih, with the situation leaning heavily to one side, the score being 69-19.</p>

<p>Ended in a 3-3 Draw</p>
<p>Only Played 25 Minutes in the Second Half</p>
<p>The intercollegiate football match between St. John's University and Shanghai University was held at Shen Park yesterday afternoon for the third final. Students from both schools came to cheer, but due to the late start time (3:45 PM), only 25 minutes were played in the second half, ending in a 3-3 draw. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>St. John's University</p>
<p>Zhu Wenji</p>
<p>Xu Chengxun Bao Shantong Wu Zhenbang</p>
<p>Mao Yixin Li Huaxing Wang Guangtao</p>
<p>Zheng Zhengren Maurice Chen Jisi</p>
<p>Wang Binghui</p>
<p>Shanghai University</p>
<p>Pan Zhaokai</p>
<p>Zhou Gongliang Chen Jiadao Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Hu Qiu Liu Xing Feng Nianhua Tang Yongchun</p>
<p>Feng Yulai Li Ruchao</p>
<p>Huang Wenfan</p>
<h3>Cheerleading Squads Have Their Own Characteristics</h3>
<p>There were 700 to 800 students from both schools who came to cheer. St. John's even brought a bronze drum to the field. Both sides sang their school songs at the beginning and then performed various cheers. St. John's was led by three people, one of whom was skilled in acrobatics, performing a series of hollow somersaults to win a lot of applause. Shanghai University arrived later, led by five people, including two women, one of whom was a Western woman with blue eyes and blonde hair, wearing white pants and a black shirt, speaking in a delicate voice, which made St. John's cheerleading squad pale in comparison.</p>
<h3>In Terms of Football Skills, St. John's is Better</h3>
<p>In terms of football skills, St. John's is indeed better than Shanghai University. St. John's also has a stronger offensive, and their short passes are beautiful. The whole team is well-coordinated. Xu Chengxun's left inside forward is steady and experienced, worthy of being called a leader. Center back Li Huaxing is also very outstanding. The forwards Wu Zhenbang are brave and good at fighting, and the wingers are also good at opening corner kicks, but unfortunately, Zhu Wenji's strength is insufficient, and he did nothing in the end. Shanghai University's Feng Nianhua is a center back who takes care of all sides and is foolproof. Among the forwards, Qian Jingyong is the best. Qian is indeed a famous player from Donghua in the past. The wingers are weak, relying entirely on the three people in the middle. The goalkeepers of both teams are mediocre, but St. John's failure to win is really due to poor shooting.</p>
<h3>Penalty Kicks Break the Silence</h3>
<p>At 3:45 PM, the sun was dim and there was a hint of rain. The cheerleading squads perked up and worked hard to cheer. Shanghai University kicked off first. Before long, St. John's right winger Wang Binghui dribbled the ball in, but was blocked by Shanghai University's Chen Jiadao. St. John's Chen Jisi rushed up to intercept it, and killed it to the door, Shanghai University's Zhou Gongliang was illegally blocked, and was penalized a penalty kick, St. John's left inside forward Xu Chengxun took the kick and succeeded in one fell swoop, setting the first record,</p>
<h3>3-1 Shanghai University Suffers</h3>
<p>Shanghai University has a morbid fear, and the St. John's forwards can act rampant, passing beautifully, making Shanghai University run around exhausted. Moreover, the goalkeeper Hu Bao is cautious and timid as a mouse. In a few minutes, Wu Zhenbang scored another goal. Shanghai University tried to retaliate, and Qian Jingyong bravely crowned the three armies, St. John's was penalized a free kick 30 yards in front of the goal, Qian Jingyong kicked out, the ball was very fast, right in the middle of the door, St. John's goalkeeper missed the ball, and the ball flew into the net, regaining a city, before long, the Shanghai University goalkeeper hesitated and made a mistake, Wu Zhenbang scored another , St. John's took the lead with 3-1,</p>
<h3>First Half 3-3 Draw</h3>
<p>The entire army of Shanghai University was furious and worked hard to counterattack. Qian Jingyong and St. John's Maurice grabbed the ball and fell each other, and Pan Zhaokai reaped the benefits of the fisherman and sent it to the St. John's door. At that time, the St. John's inside guard stood too far out, and the distant water could not quench the thirst nearby, and he could not turn around in time. He was angrily shot by Shanghai University's Li Ruchao, and the ratio became 3 to 2. St. John's Maurice touched the ball to the Shanghai University gate, and was poured into another ball by the St. John's front, but it was not counted because of offside, Wang Binghui sent out a very good corner, but it did not help, St. John's offensive was extremely strong, but unexpectedly the rear was empty, Shanghai University smuggled into Chen Cang, Qian Jingyong made another attack, and became a 3-3 draw, so Shanghai University's momentum greatly increased, and he Ruchao fiercely shot a ball, and the St. John's goalkeeper turned around and saved it to the ground, which was wonderfully incomparable, Sigh to the point of perfection,</p>
<h3>Second Half Toil in Vain</h3>
<p>At the end of the first half, the clock had struck four times, the sky was gloomy, and the twilight was even more obvious. Unless the lights were grabbed for a night battle, it would be difficult to end the game. Therefore, after kicking to more than half of the 25 minutes, the referee announced the suspension of the game. Both sides gained nothing and dispersed with a 3-3 draw. During these 25 minutes, the competitive situation was very tense. Two guards from Shanghai University put in extra effort and built high fortresses to prevent St. John's from crossing the Lei Pond for a step, but St. John's was like a broken bamboo, besieging endlessly, and the artillery shells were fired in a string, but most of them were weak and powerless, or became baseballs, and there was nothing to gain, only failure.</p>

<h3>Independent College Football Championship: Tongde Defeats Southeast to Win Final Right</h3>
<p>One to Zero</p>
<p>The football championship of the Joint Sports Meeting of Independent Colleges has already begun. Last Sunday (16th) at 2:00 PM, Tongde Medical College and Southeast Medical College met at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui. More than a hundred cheerleaders from both schools came to cheer. The two sides began to contact in the silver whistle. Tongde faced the sun, and the geographical advantage was not good. In the first 15 minutes, the ball was always in the Southeast's territory, circling and not going away. The Southeast responded calmly and did not make any mistakes. Once, Tongde's left winger Shi Guozhang intercepted the ball and sent it to the center, but unfortunately the center Li Shimo was too hasty, and the ball crossed the crossbar. After that, the Tongde forwards had many opportunities to shoot, but they all failed to score due to their eagerness to succeed, which was a pity. After Southeast's bad luck had gone, they relied on their rapid passing to launch a combined attack. The Tongde gate was full of Southeast cavalry, with long-range shots and close kicks, and the momentum was mighty. Tongde's goalkeeper showed off his skills, catching and blocking from left to right, sending Adu one by one, turning danger into safety. The first half ended with zero to zero, and neither side gained anything. After the lemon time, Tongde, in view of the inviolability of the Southeast in the first half, changed its formation, transferred fresh troops to the field, and captain Lin Qingchi led the three armies to kill the forbidden city of Southeast. Five minutes later, the center Li Shimo received reinforcements from the rear, calmly kicked towards the gate, and the goalkeeper of Southeast punched with both hands, and the ball went into the bottom of the net at will, and the record was opened. Since the Southeast lost a city, how could it be willing to show weakness, the five forwards connected and counterattacked, like a landslide and tsunami, with a million-foot-tall arrogance, Lin Qingchi, the town of Tongde, sat in the Central Plains, running back and forth, driving the ball out one by one, preserving half of the country, until the last ten minutes, the Southeast's attack gradually showed laxity, Tongde took the opportunity to attack, but gained nothing, and the second half ended with a result of one to zero, Tongde won the final right, and returned in triumph, Tongde's lineup is as follows,</p>
<p>Shi Guozhang</p>
<p>Jiang Delin Shen Minshu down</p>
<p>Tu Jifa Luo Jingbo up</p>
<p>Li Xiongzhang Lin Qingchi Li Shimo</p>
<p>Xiang Xiangsheng Zhang Yutai up You Deliang down</p>
<p>Luo Jingbo down Gong Zongde</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Poor Girl Should Not Be Ashamed to Take on the Role of a Teacher, and a Tutor Is Not Worth Respecting; Empty Humility Is in Vain</p>
<p>So, amidst Hu's repeated urgings to "stand up, stand up," she truly stood up. Unknowingly, she had taken the cigarette in her hand. She didn't know how to smoke and didn't dare put it down, so she held the cigarette without knowing what to do with it. Moreover, she and Jia Duocai were standing very close, almost within breathing distance. The closer they were, the more restless Jia Duocai became, staring intently at Yueying's face. He wasn't nearsighted and needed to see her up close; he wanted to take this opportunity to examine Yueying's skin closely. Poor Yueying, unable to be embarrassed, had to blush and let him stare. Hu chuckled, "What are you doing standing there like a fool? Bring the cigarette to Master Jia's mouth and light it for him. You need to know that a concubine serves her master like this." Yueying, unable to defy her words, had to do as she was told. She brought the cigarette to Jia Duocai's mouth, and he indeed leaned over, holding the cigarette butt in his mouth, naturally with a smile on his face. He held the table, and there was a box of matches nearby. He picked it up, struck a match, and reached out to light the cigarette. Of course, this was an amateurish gesture. Jia Duocai reached out and held her hand, flattening it, before lighting the cigarette. He smiled and released her hand, saying, "Next time you light a cigarette, you have to learn this way, or you'll burn the smoker's eyebrows off." Yueying was afraid of him staring at her face, and he actually held her hand, so she could only endure the embarrassment. Hu, seeing this, chimed in, "Does that mean Master Jia agrees to this matter?" Jia Duocai laughed, "What makes you think I agree?" Hu smiled, "Didn't you say that in the future, she'll have to light your cigarettes this way?" Jia Duocai laughed, "I'm just saying that as an example. If you're all willing to do as I say, then this is settled." (93)</p>
<h3>Slaughterhouse</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>On that wide road stands a tall steel-and-concrete factory, surrounded by a low wall. Blood, diluted by water and turned light red, flows incessantly from the drains outside.</p>
<p>This is a slaughterhouse, the central mechanism supplying fresh beef to every market in the city.</p>
<p>It is said that each cow, in the slaughtering machine, takes no more than two minutes not only to lose its life and have its skin completely peeled off, but also to have its heart, liver, and stomach prepared, and its entire body dismembered and washed clean. Slaughtering cows with such a machine's swift actions is said to be humane, because it is naturally much better than slaughtering cows in the old way, where each cow suffered dozens of cuts before dying.</p>
<p>But as I pass the slaughterhouse every day, I often see groups of cows being led into the slaughterhouse by their owners to await their execution. Strangely, every cow slows down its pace about ten yards from the slaughterhouse door, refusing to walk. The owners whip them constantly, but after being whipped, they take two steps and then stop again. Some simply kneel on the ground, refusing to stand up. Some even shed tears from their eyes and cry out incessantly, as if they know that their lives are about to end.</p>
<p>The mischievous children wait for the arrival of the cows every day, using small bamboo sticks to hit the cows' rumps for amusement. But when the cows kneel on the ground and cry out, they are stunned, unknowingly dropping their small bamboo sticks on the ground. Only after the owners forcefully pull the cows one by one into the steel-and-concrete slaughterhouse do they walk away listlessly.</p>
<p>Not long after, bloody water from the drains flows out again, and after a while, chunks of beef steaming with heat are loaded onto trucks and sent to the markets for sale.</p>
<p>Then, another group of cows waiting to be slaughtered arrives at the door.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Shui E</p>
<p>The Chinese like to keep their hands in their sleeves, so they always "stand by with their hands in their sleeves" when something happens.</p>
<p>Not only do they keep their hands in their sleeves, but they also like to tie up their trouser legs, so when something happens, everyone is "bound and unable to move forward."</p>
<h3>Mr. Thick-Skinned</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>I have many eccentric friends, and Mr. Thick-Skinned is one of them. Mr.'s original surname was Zou. His father died suddenly of illness, and his mother remarried a Mr. Huang, so he followed her in taking the surname Huang. Some people criticized him for this, and he angrily retorted, "This is my filial piety, repaying my mother's kindness. It is also my freedom. Even if I take the surname Zhang, Zheng, Li, or Zhao, no one has the right to interfere!" Everyone was speechless, smiled secretly, and retreated. This is how the name "Thick-Skinned" came about.</p>
<p>Mr.'s appearance is not different from ordinary people, but it is also unique. His nose is flat and large, his eyes are round and small like a rat's, his lips are thick and wide, and he looks like he is eating people when he smiles. His face is round, which is originally a sign of wealth, but the three or five pockmarks near his temples spoil the feng shui. His eyebrows are thick and black, slightly fierce, so the expression on his face is often awkward. His friends are happy to associate with him because he is generally honest and kind. However, Mr. is indeed an amorous person who often asks his friends to act as matchmakers for him, and he takes large group photos and distributes them like flyers. Once, a certain organization held a meeting, and there was a female member. Mr. immediately, in the name of Representative X Committee Member, showed great enthusiasm towards her, helping her take off her coat and change her handkerchief. He first presented her with a card, then showed her his works. Later, the woman had a sudden urge to use the restroom, and he volunteered to be her guide, unexpectedly taking her directly to the inner room, where he was shouted out by other female guests using the restroom, and he instead accused the female guests of being old-fashioned. Thus, the name "Thick-Skinned" spread even more widely.</p>
<p>One day, I was entertaining two of my wife's brothers at home. There were four kinds of cold dishes and two pounds of Shaoxing wine. Just as we were about to pick up our chopsticks, Mr. Thick-Skinned arrived. I quickly pulled him to the side room and told him that today was a family gathering for my relatives and that it was not convenient to invite Mr. to be an intimate guest, and I hinted that he should leave quickly. But he was unmoved and insisted that I introduce him. Helpless, I had to quickly invite him to sit down. Before I could even say a word, his chopsticks were already moving like raindrops, eating and saying, "Life in this world is all empty. Only eating is the most practical. I believe that eating is my life's purpose. Even when I die, I don't need a coffin." Coincidentally, at this time, the neighbor woman was scolding a cat that was stealing food, "You beast, tomorrow I'll buy a bag of arsenic to poison you to death!" Mr. Thick-Skinned seemed to sense something and left before the end of the meal.</p>
<p>The next morning, a letter arrived, saying, "Yesterday, when I went to the back door, I realized that I had misunderstood the scolding. I thought about going back in, but it seemed to involve face, because there were your relatives present. It's a pity that I didn't get to gorge on the shredded pork and vegetable heart..." His thick skin was such that one could only sigh in admiration. Therefore, I wrote "Mr. Thick-Skinned" to promote benevolence!</p>

<h3>Pawnshops in Europe and America (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhengping</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>In Germany, in addition to private pawnshops, there are state-run, city-town-village-run, and public organization-run public pawnshops. The capital is subsidized by the organizers and does not rely on fundraising. The interest rate is from 6% to 12%, while private pawnshops charge from 12% to 24% annual interest. The term is half a year to a year, and if one is unable to redeem the item at the time, one can pay in installments. After the term expires, the item can be auctioned off immediately. Before the sale, the pawnor can redeem the item by paying a special handling fee. If there is a surplus after the sale, it must be returned to the pawnor. The authorities are responsible for compensating for any loss of the item.</p>
<p>(7) Austria</p>
<p>Austria's public pawnshop industry is similar to that of Germany. The loan interest rate is from 5% to 10% annual interest. The smaller the pawn amount, the lower the interest rate charged, which is its characteristic. The term is also usually one year, and the liability for compensation is the same as in Germany.</p>
<h3>Records of Faint Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter Nineteen: Fox Immortal Pagoda</p>
<p>"Today, we must take a trip to the Fox Immortal Pagoda; it is also a very famous place!" After our visit to the relics of the past emperors, the Empress Dowager's melancholy had lessened considerably the next morning. After getting dressed, she planned to go out for a tour. Her actions were, of course, absolutely free. She did not need to ask for our consent and could take us wherever she pleased, but she often liked to show off her own knowledge. Whenever something new happened, or before going to a new place, she would always tell us some general information first. At this time, she told us as usual: "We have heard about the story of the Fox Immortal for a long time! This Fox Immortal Pagoda is the place of cultivation after repentance. Now that we have arrived in Fengtian, we must take a trip, or it would be a pity!"</p>
<p>"Then, what is its story?" We asked her for details, partly driven by curiosity and partly to amuse her.</p>
<p>She smiled very proudly and immediately agreed to tell us. In fact, even if we didn't ask, she would definitely tell us automatically. So we heard a story about the thousand-year-old nine-tailed fox that we had never heard before. The following are the words of the Empress Dowager:</p>
<p>"Before this Fox Immortal was born as a fox, what kind of beast it was, no one can answer. Even the Jade Emperor in heaven probably couldn't say. Everyone only knows that its previous life must have been a very fierce and terrible thing, which was only harmful and not beneficial to humans. But the detailed situation is not clear." (203)</p>

<h3>One Aspect of Shanghai's Wartime Literature</h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>丨丨 Poems about the Opium War</p>
<p>Those who have an accurate understanding of Shanghai's history are well aware of the relationship between the Opium War and Shanghai. Now that we revisit the past, we cannot help but sigh at the Qing government's ignorance and incompetence. Nevertheless, the battle of Wusong is a tragic and magnificent historical event. The poems that have been passed down, describing the turmoil of the time, still make us feel the greatness of those "national heroes" when we read them today.</p>
<p>On June 9, 1842, British warships arrived near the Wusong estuary. Governor Niu Jian was stationed in Baoshan City, Jiangnan Admiral Chen Huacheng was stationed at the West Fort, the Xuzhou Garrison General was stationed at Xiaoshabei, and Acting General Zhou Shirong was stationed at the East Fort. On the 12th, the British troops advanced in a line of ships, and our army waited in full battle array. The tense situation at that time was truly as Yang Jinjie described:</p>
<p>"Clouds darken, morning sprinkles with tears of thousands;</p>
<p>Moon chills, night submerges in smoke from ten thousand stoves."</p>
<p>And as Jiang Dunfu said in "Ode to General Yingchuan":</p>
<p>"Towering giant cannons on the east and west platforms, towering ships cross the sea, wind and smoke arise,</p>
<p>This is the golden key to Jiangnan, ushering in ten thousand miles of peace."</p>
<p>On the 16th, the battle began. Chen Huacheng opened fire against the enemy, causing significant casualties to the enemy forces. Later, the enemy attacked the East Fort and Xiaoshabei. The troops at Xiaoshabei retreated first, and the troops at the East Fort then collapsed. Niu Jian abandoned the city and fled, and Baoshan City fell into the hands of the British. However, the West Fort still resisted with all its might until death, and as a result, Admiral Chen and eighty others died in battle.</p>
<p>Bei Qingqiao, a famous scholar from Suzhou, once wrote a satirical poem about the event:</p>
<p>"Sea mirage demons press against the flagpoles, eagerly watching the ax-wielding valiant ones.</p>
<p>The unwavering spirit of Suiyang can become a vengeful ghost, a sword should first be used to behead Helan."</p>
<p>Jiang Dunfu also said:</p>
<p>"How can there be strategic planning worthy of a commander, merely laborious tiger servants misleading military planning.</p>
<p>All matters have always been marred by interference, such a strategic pass is lost!"</p>
<p>They all expressed dissatisfaction with Niu Jian, who was called "Governor", and praised Chen Huacheng's bravery and courage. Bei Qingqiao even more forcefully expressed this in the poem "Visiting the Memorial Temple of Duke Zhongmin Chen in Hudou", as follows:</p>
<p>"In the first battle at the Yongjiang estuary, the governor died, the admiral fled. In the second battle at the Wusong estuary, the admiral died, the governor fled. The third battle reached the city of Jinling, the river waves are silent, no sound is heard. After General Chen, who dares to send troops? Do you not see that those who fled are abandoned in the market, those who died live on forever. Live on forever, their spirits are revered by the people of the coast."</p>
<p>Originally, after the British army captured Wusong and Shanghai, they could sail up the Yangtze River, capture Zhenjiang, and threaten Nanjing. As a result, the Qing court endured humiliation and negotiated peace, and the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, opening Shanghai as a treaty port. (The establishment of the concessions was another matter.) Jiang Dunfu expressed deep feelings in his poem, saying:</p>
<p>"Defeat was reported on the riverbank, news spread, but not all was true.</p>
<p>Basha and Jimen were like child's play, Xiao Niang and Lü Mu each escaped unscathed.</p>
<p>I heard that trade has already begun this year, the court itself plans for the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>When the decree to demarcate concessions was issued, ten thousand people rejoiced, but pitiful were the good families of the six prefectures."</p>
<p>In this battle, apart from Chen Huacheng and others, only Yang Qing'en, the registrar of Shanghai, died in the fighting among the local officials in Shanghai, and only Li Tongyang, the county magistrate of Zhejiang, Wu Shi Yu Fu, and Governor Yu Qian died. Bei Qingqiao wrote another poem, saying:</p>
<p>"Sing aloud the song of the loyal martyr of Linjiang, the song flows with anger, filling rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>How is it that those who sacrifice their lives for the country are mostly deaf officials and drunken lieutenants."</p>
<p>He thoroughly condemned the demoralization of the time and the cowardice of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>These poems will be passed down forever, preserving the light of the nation.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Exchange Market Turns Firm</p>
<p>The Standard Gold Price Falls 6.6 Yuan</p>
<p>Rumors After Closing Suggesting the Bullish Trend Has Not DimINIshed</p>
<p>After the gold market experienced a surprising surge recently, the market fell back yesterday. However, investor confidence remains high, and the bullish trend persists. There were many interruptions during the day. During this time of extreme financial tightness, bullish rumors resurfaced, and the upward trend resumed after the close. Initially in the morning, overseas silver markets in both England and the United States contracted. However, major players said that the United States had bought forward silver at the close, with the Montevideo forward silver price contracting by between 0.06 and 0.09. Exchange rates continued to fall, and London spot gold rose by 7.5 pence. People were uneasy about inflation. Mr. Mau was already denying that the news was spreading. Off-market trading was rumored to be around 98.89, which was relatively stable compared to the previous day's close. However, major players such as Fuyong, Yuan Maoyong, Fufu, and Ren Fayong sold and forecast a fall. The Central Bank's posted rates revealed that the pound was flat and the U.S. dollar contracted by 0.0625. The customs gold unit rose by 0.01. The standard gold price was 1004.6 yuan, which had little impact, and investor confidence was slightly weak. After opening, major players continued to offer, and prices gradually fell. However, due to investor uneasiness, there were frequent interruptions after prices fell. The situation was uncertain, and investor confidence remained bullish. Later, demand from major players exceeded supply. It was learned that the HSBC posted rates would reveal that the pound was flat and the U.S. dollar contracted by 0.0625, which would still be able to boost prices. The psychology of brokers was clearly uncertain. While supply was still abundant, banks were scrambling to cover their positions. At this time, the overall trend was stable but fluctuating. Chinese merchants seemed tired and continued to supply, and the foreign exchange and gold markets followed suit and fell. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it was still 6.5%. The exchange rate, calculated at 1 shilling and 5.4375 pence, contracted by 0.125. After falling, there was still a rebound, and banks then reversed course and sold. The exchange market slightly firmed, and the situation within the market suddenly showed that supply exceeded demand, gradually falling to within 90. Despite some fluctuation, it was difficult to push prices up because Sassoon was selling shillings. Later, banks took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and the Central Bank also intervened to maintain prices, which then rebounded. However, sellers continued to be active, and the underlying trend weakened in the afternoon, and the market fell back into the 90 yuan range. After opening, investor confidence was relatively stable, and prices gradually rose to above 90 yuan. However, as Indian silver was initially reported to have risen by 2 annas, there was still a downward trend. Major players took advantage of the low prices to purchase.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Financial Circles Gradually Absorb</p>
<p>Public Bonds Stage a Major Rally</p>
<p>The 20th Customs Bond Rises 1.85 Yuan, the Largest Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, rumors continued to circulate in the Chinese Securities Exchange that the paper money policy was very favorable, and that currency devaluation was a huge undertaking. It was heard that financial giants and economic experts from across the country had formed a committee to plan the steps to be taken. However, because this matter was of great importance, temporary or alternative transitional measures were being considered, with opinions varying widely. Therefore, market prices initially showed signs of hesitation and disorder, but then rose in a straight line. Although the foreign call loan rate was as high as 0.3, the rising trend could not be contained. The foreign call loan rate may continue to rise, and the market price may inevitably experience a period of disorder. In addition, the settlement period was approaching, so there was still much turbulence. Yesterday's events saw an initial decline of 0.3 to 0.5 jiao, suggesting a possible decline. However, as financial circles gradually absorbed bonds, mostly through brokers acting on behalf of others to avoid attention, the subsequent market prices turned upward, rising 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. The trend reversed, and in the next round, a major rally occurred, with the rising trend intensifying, rising by several jiao to over 1 yuan. In the afternoon, due to time constraints, only one round of trading was conducted, and short sellers continued to cover their positions, with prices rising another 0.1 to 0.4 jiao. As a result, market prices rose across the board, by several jiao to 1.85 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 33 to 34 million. The comparison of the rising and falling results is listed in the left table (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Yarn Prices Decline in Reaction</p>
<p>The yarn market opened rather weakly this morning, due to overly激烈的涨势 of the previous day. Rumors of an oversupply of goods and a paper currency policy circulated. Upon reading the newspapers today, there was absolutely no record of these events. The enthusiastic atmosphere suddenly turned cold. Simultaneously, some news emerged suggesting a reluctance to take delivery of yarn this month. As other firms had already sold off, the market became increasingly sluggish, and prices subsequently fell. However, the future situation remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Gold Chicken Brand Falls by 1.5 Yuan. Pre-market trading of standard yarn saw prices open lower due to a weakening trend in foreign cotton and the previous day's rumors of significant 通货膨胀 and paper currency policies. These rumors were found to have minimal basis in newspaper reports today. Simultaneously, falling gold prices caused significant pessimism in the market, with a decrease in buyers, leading to a reactive price decline. Prices for all months fell by 1.2, 3, and 5 jiao. The afternoon session opened with the market remaining flat and weak, but some hedging activity led to a slight rebound, with prices for all months rising by 1 or 2 jiao. Sales included 2,500 bales of Gengfeng, 800 bales of Chang, 3,300 bales of Shunda, 400 bales of Yuan Yi, 450 bales of Taichang, 1,400 bales of Cheng, 1,350 bales of Deji, 650 bales of Yuan Da, 900 bales of Shenji, 1,850 bales of Dafeng, 2,150 bales of Yuda, 400 bales of Yuan Da, 650 bales of Jinchang, 1,050 bales of Mingde, 1,000 bales of Shenchang, 400 bales of Senkang, 550 bales of Hengde, 3,250 bales of Changfeng, and 550 bales of Runkang.

<p>Cotton Market Weakens. Prices decline further. Due to yesterday's excessive涨势, U.S. cotton prices have weakened, and the inflation situation has not yet materialized. The fall in gold prices has led to the release of speculative positions, and spot cotton sales in the market remain sluggish. The market sentiment has suddenly changed, but the Indian cotton market remains strong.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton: Speculative Positions Released. The Zheng Standard cotton market opened lower due to a 10-point drop in U.S. cotton prices.

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened quietly, with prices declining slightly by 0.02 yuan. The market was weak in the morning due to domestic and international selling pressure and hedging by cotton farmers. (200,000 bales of certified cotton are still awaiting sale or hedging.) Brokers were the main buyers, with little actual demand. Brokers intend to wait for the announcement of the new Penkehai case allocation method before proceeding with their strategy. (The upcoming production quota will be set at 11 million bales, causing anxiety.) In the end, sales by Japanese firms led to a decline of 0.07 to 0.08 yuan by closing. Spot demand is quiet, and the fundamentals are still stable. Although the yarn market is firm, buyers are not interested in current prices, resulting in a flat closing. Spot prices fell by 0.10 yuan, and futures prices fell by 0.06 to 0.10 yuan. British spot cotton fell by 1 point, and futures fell by 2 or 3 points. Indian cotton rose due to buying by market manipulators and European exporters. Ping Guolan and Bai Luoxi rose by 1.25 rupees, and Mule rose by 1.5 rupees. (Excerpt from the original telegram, dated the 17th.)</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Activity from Out-of-Town Merchants</p>
<p>Standard Flour Gradually Strengthens</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for various months generally remained stable and volatile. With the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago continued to fall by about 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan, and Canada fell by about 0.02 and 0.04 yuan. When prices opened, because the quotation for foreign wheat was low, both inside and outside the industry took a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the initial market was loose and uneventful. Subsequently, trading in various sessions remained weak. However, as factories did not sell off aggressively, the market remained buoyant. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market slightly picked up. Due to hedging and tight supply this month, out-of-town merchants had slight demand, and prices stabilized. For longer-term months, out-of-industry buying remained active, and prices gradually increased. As monthly exchange rates frequently contracted, ordering spot wheat inevitably caused further anxiety. As a result, this month was slightly better by 0.005 yuan, January was better by 0.0125 yuan, February was better by 0.015 yuan, March was better by 0.0175 yuan, April was better by 0.02 yuan, and May was better by 0.0175 yuan.</p>

With the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by about 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan, and Canada fell by 0.03 and 0.04 yuan. After quotations, trading in various months remained inactive, and prices fluctuated little. In the afternoon sessions, the current month initially fell by 0.03 and 0.04 yuan due to approaching delivery. However, it then slightly improved. Quotations for longer-term months remained low. Selling was limited because settlement was approaching, and there was no aggressive trading inside or outside the market. As a result, this month was slightly down by 0.005 yuan, January and February were down by 0.01 yuan, and March was better by 0.01 yuan. In the spot wheat market, there was a slight increase in trading, and prices also rose slightly by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. Shandong wheat opened at 4.06 yuan, and Xuzhou Yao wheat opened at 4.03 yuan.

<h3>Our Era and Literature</h3>
<p>— Di Zhou</p>
<p>Let us try to open our eyes and see how humanity's entire life in this era—social, cultural—is churning in a universal torrent! Let us try to quietly trace the history of the past; I fear we cannot find a state of life as rich and vigorous as the present! The simplest example is: on any given day, we know how humans are racking their brains and exhausting their strength—either large-scale production and construction are completed, or most production mechanisms go bankrupt, or valuable scientific inventions succeed, and finally, or the execution of battles—wars, military expansion, negotiations, disturbances...</p>
<p>These can all be reported to us by daily newspapers and magazines. Even though in this kaleidoscopic phenomenon, the joy and sorrow given to people are unequal, and the influences and effects given to people are different, we cannot but say: This era is a great era unprecedented in history, no matter from which aspect!</p>
<p>In this way, what kind of development can the literature of this era have? This is a question worth examining, and at the same time, it is a question that must be raised and answered for modern literary youths.</p>
<p>From the historian's perspective, the tragedies of ancient Greece could only be produced in the balanced and sophisticated slave culture of that time. Only under the conditions of the high development of handicraft and commercial capital in England in the late sixteenth century could English culture be rapidly improved, and Shakespeare's national treasure-like dramas appear. Critics have not erased personal genius, but personal genius exists in society. Therefore, the production of brilliant art and great works is only possible under appropriate social conditions. Furthermore, different social situations and conditions produce different art or works. The difference between Shakespeare's tragedies and ancient Greek tragedies is an illustration of the latter point. "The Iron Flood," "Cement," and "The Rout" are famous works that could only be produced after the end of military affairs, which is the best example of the former point.</p>
<p>So, what are the social conditions of this era? What kind of development conditions does the current social image provide for literature? We can examine it from two aspects.</p>
<p>First: The current social images reflect the entirety of humanity's rational content to the highest degree. Old appearances from ancient times to the present, as well as new postures that were only prototypes in modern times and are now surging forward, all exist simultaneously with flesh and blood. The "sublimity" of mankind in the play "Antigone" that Hegel repeatedly praised, the unfolding of an entire era in Tolstoy's works that Vladimir longed for, etc., are now presented to people in a more vast, profound, and insightful manner. This is to say that the reality of this era provides literature with an incomparably rich content. With its developing melody and tremors, it not only extracts the "ordinary" materials all over the mountains and valleys but also extraordinarily indicates the central content where the "meaning" lies. From this point of view, the surroundings of this era provide materials for great literary content that were not available before. Isn't it true that serious people are absorbing these materials, organizing these materials, and nurturing them into the brilliant light like the rising sun of the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany...?</p>
<p>Second: The exploration of new literary frontiers has, up to now, left behind many monuments that shake the souls of people in this era. These, at least, exist as signposts for the pioneers of contemporary literature, radiating light. Generally speaking, we now have the conditions for great creation. From ideological criticism to the application of new techniques, there are many models and sufficient experience. However, these conditions show differences in degree due to the different historical developments in various regions. For example, China's current "this kind of" situation cannot be said to be a suitable condition for producing great works. Even so, the existence of that condition is an undeniable fact. The era is demanding the production of great works. It has provided all the things needed for great works and is looking forward to it. But it also spreads many difficulties and obstacles. This can only be resolved by the efforts and struggles of literary pioneers. This is also: literary pioneers have fulfilled their mission to the era.</p>
<p>In short, this era demands that its literary creators must live hard and write hard! The past era has never had the greatness and richness of today; the past has never had such an era, which grants creators the ability to write in the trend and earnestly and sincerely demands that they produce great works!</p>

<h3>Literary Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zai Qing</p>
<p>"Yellow Leaves" entering poetry are most evocative. After writing "Small Talk on Yellow Leaves," I have seen quite a few more. For example, Wu Shaoyun's "Wilted white lotus, people seeking society, desolate yellow leaves, magpies chirping in the village," "Autumn sound in yellow leaves, mountain shadow in twilight smoke," and "Bamboo light like sea blue clouds stopping, distant temple bell sounds heard several times. Walking to the end of Zhaoti's yellow leaf road, across the river, mountain color reaches the green door" (Lingyin Quan Taoguang) can all be said to be rare good lines. Recently, reading Ai Hongdao's poems, he also often uses "yellow leaves," but there are not many good lines. However, seeing his "Splitting Yellow Leaves to Stop Children from Crying," I am reminded that "yellow leaves" are also occasionally used in Buddhist books, but the meaning is different. Wu Linzheng and his uncle Shengbai painted clouds: "I also heard that my uncle does not send a single piece of paper to the capital, which is what he should do in his later years. Nowadays, important positions are fed up with meat, and a small amount of yellow leaves is not enough to stop children from crying. Why not simplify it to ensure purity? My uncle may mean this"? His meaning is the same as Yuan's poem, using "yellow leaves" as a metaphor for things that cannot satisfy people. Why do "yellow leaves" arouse poets' interest so much? Zhang Dai once thought like this:</p>
<p>Autumn leaves that are pure yellow are superior, variegated colors are next, and water red is next, the quality of the flowers, is beautiful here. But their haggard spirit is mostly in the midst of brilliance. Their red is fresh, taking wilting as a sign of contraction; their green is greasy, and purple is dark; their yellow is particularly rhythmic, but without green. The meaning of separation and fall is exhausted, and the flower is not there, is it what the gardener calls tender color? Old trees are beautiful in frost, not peaceful. Begging for it from Lang Seng at the beginning of summer was too early, unbearable for its worries; now it is thriving and glorious, enough to clap and praise. The sweetness of holding a crab and paddling for more than ten days, how can it be considered!</p>
<p>This can be seen in the eighth volume of "Notes," which shows that his understanding of "yellow leaves" is more profound than that of Li Jun and his like. The reason why "yellow leaves" are cherished by old poets is indeed due to the "nothing left" and "exhausted" mentioned here. A symbol of the extinction of life, a lament in the midst of the bleak autumn sound, is most likely to attack sentimental poets. As for those who do not look at "yellow leaves" with sentimental eyes, it is probably not in autumn, or perhaps only "imperfect beauty" can be used as an explanation. "Yellow leaves" are fundamentally not a sign of health. "Walking slowly and humming, the intention is unbearable," the sentimental poet's heart is mostly like this.</p>
<h3>Descriptions and Content in Novels</h3>
<p>— Ding Yishan</p>
<p>Speak of the general, not the details; look at the mainstream, not the tributaries.</p>
<p>A novel is a kind of descriptive and expressive social scientific reading material: the object it writes about is people, it describes the various phenomena of "people" striving and acting for individual survival and reproduction (or the continuation of the race), it describes the relationship between people and nature, society, and individuals. The expressions, hints, imitations, conflicts, cooperation, struggles, compromises, overcoming, surrender, or other similar qualities of these relationships. The causes or motives of these relationships are the desires of people that must be satisfied, and the results are either sad or happy, or a mixture of both. The difference between novels and other descriptive social sciences (such as history and geography) is that others appeal to our rational understanding, while novels appeal to both our rational understanding and our emotional appreciation.</p>
<p>A novel is not only an art to be appreciated, but it is also a kind of knowledge. What it describes and what it wants us to understand is the relative position of people in the system of nature, the relative position of groups and individuals in society, the motives of human activities, and the various relationships between these activities and the natural world, society, and the biological environment. Their concrete and invisible processes, psychological states, and their real and possible results. A novel can be a description of the phenomenon of a cross-section of human behavior, but more often it is a systematic description. It contains a historical nature, and allows for a considerable degree of imagination. It describes the past, and it also describes the future. It describes what it was and what it is more, and it describes what it will be and what it ought to be less, because readers can infer the future based on the past and present, and prophetic novels are not very reasonable.</p>
<p>Novels do not tell us doctrines and principles, like other descriptive social sciences, but they can implicitly or vaguely adopt doctrines and principles to make the phenomena described clearer, allowing readers to experience and discover them themselves. Its objective scope is the relationship between people and the natural, social, and biological environments, so its descriptions include natural landscapes, cities and villages, institutions and systems, individual behaviors and their characteristics, psychological states, and the sad or happy results of people's activities in various aspects. Many novels describe the relationship between people and the social environment (emphasizing institutional aspects) and the biological environment (emphasizing human aspects). For example, when describing fishermen by the sea and farmers on land, it is necessary to write about the struggle between people and nature, such as against wind, rain, drought, insect pests, etc. China's floods and droughts are most sufficient to express the struggle and relationship between farmers and the natural world. Although there are still no good works written with this kind of material, we can still understand this principle. The phenomenon of people in cold regions fighting with the geographical environment and the Dutch fighting with water especially shows the relationship between people and nature. The description of novels, in method and attitude, is not very different from other descriptive social sciences (such as history and geography). For example, the local color in novels means that novels contain geographical nature.</p>
<p>As for the method, novels use factual descriptions to make us aware of nature, society, and human nature. Sometimes they also try to explain, but it is different from what history, geography, and sociology do; the latter are all objective narratives and explanations, while novels contain reasonable imagination that does not violate the facts, because novels naturally include artistic components, and artistic components are to make the disguised facts have a greater effect on readers. Many novels have been made into movies, which makes us understand that novels are a description of a life in a certain place at a certain time, the aspect of life is not limited, and the size of the scope is not limited. Taking history, geography, and sociology for comparison, movies adapted from novels help us understand that novels appeal to our emotions and intellect. In fact, personnel matters are peculiar and abnormal, like the examples at both ends of the curve in statistics, and the experience, knowledge, and understanding of individuals are limited. Sometimes we read the peculiar places of personnel matters written in novels, sometimes it exceeds, sometimes it falls short. The truly peculiar personnel matters should not be viewed with pure subjective views. Except for the case study method in sociology, which is similar to novels, other social sciences all make generalized narratives and studies, which are abstract and conceptual: the description of novels is concrete, realistic, and close to our lives. Because of this, novels are the most able to express the various positions and psychology of people and are the most noticed and welcomed by us.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (20)</h3>
<p>— Written by (Joseph Conrad), translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>They stood there like mutes. The old man, restless at the window, muttered to himself. Suddenly he shouted shrilly: "Bessan, I see you. I'll tell Harry."</p>
<p>She stirred as if to run away, but stopped, raising both hands to her cheeks. The little Haggipots shadow, blurred and big, stood motionless like a bronze man. Above them, the old man's voice quavered and scolded in the frantic night.</p>
<p>"Drive him away, my dear. He's only a vagrant. What you need is a good home of your own.</p>
<p>That fellow has no home—he's not like Harry. He'll never be Harry. Harry's coming back tomorrow. Do you hear? One more day," he mumbled more excitedly, "you don't have to be afraid—Harry's going to marry you."</p>
<p>His tone was sharp and frantic, echoing the howl of the wind blowing against the seawall outside.</p>
<p>"He has to marry you. I'll make him do it, if little," he swore, "I'll give him a shilling tomorrow to get out of here, and give all my belongings to you. I'll do it. Give it to you. Let him starve."</p>
<p>The window slammed shut again.</p>
<p>Harry took a long breath and took a step closer to Bessan. "So it's you—the girl who's been found," he said in a low voice. She didn't move, still half-turned away from him, her head pressed into the palms of her hands. "Honestly," he went on, a faint smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "I have a great desire to stay······"</p>
<p>His arms trembled terribly.</p>
<p>"Stay for a week," he said incredibly.</p>
<p>Her hands flew to cover her face.</p>
<p>He came up very close to her, gently gripping her wrists. She felt his breath on one ear.</p>
<p>"I'm in trouble—this time, perhaps only you can see it clearly. He tried to push her face away. She resisted. So he let her go, backing away a little, he asked, "Do you have any money? I have to leave now."</p>
<p>She nodded quickly and awkwardly, he waited, looking elsewhere, in another direction, she trembled all over, lowering her head, to find a pocket on her clothes.</p>
<p>"The money is here," she whispered. "Oh, go! For God's sake, go! If I had a little more—a little more—I would give it all to you, to make you forget—to make you forget everything."</p>
<p>He held out his hand. "Don't be afraid! I haven't forgotten one of you in the world. Some women have given me more than just money—but I'm a beggar now—you women often save me from trouble."</p>
<p>He strode to the window of the parlor, and in the dim light filtering out from the window, he looked at the coins in his palm. It was a half-sovereign (equal to half a pound). He put it in the bag. She stood there sideways, her head drooping, as if wounded, her arms hanging limply at her sides, as if dead.</p>
<p>"You can't buy me, and you can't be bought by anyone," he said.</p>
<p>He pressed his hat a little harder on his head, after which, she felt herself being lifted up by the embrace of his powerful arms. Her feet had left the ground; her head was raised; he poured down kisses on her face with silent but powerful passion, as if wanting to quickly capture her soul. He kissed her pale cheeks, her hard forehead, her long eyelashes, her dim lips; the ebb and flow and sighs of the tide, accompanied by the powerful embrace of his arms, came with a pity that overcame everything. It was like the sea, breaching the dyke protecting the townspeople's homes, sending a wave over her head. The wave passed! She staggered back, her shoulders against the wall, exhausted, just like after a storm and destruction, stranded in that place.</p>
<p>After a while, she reopened her eyes; her ears listened to the firm, orderly, triumphant footsteps walking away, her hands began to gather her clothes, her eyes always staring ahead. Suddenly she sped to the open door and went out into the darkness and desolate street.</p>

<h3>Opportunity to Boast</h3>
<p>— Ma</p>
<p>The death of one's grandfather and mother is an opportunity to boast. Because one's grandfather and mother have died, hence there are obituaries and mourning announcements, and within these, the opportunity to boast arrives. How filial he was to his grandfather and mother, how he served them, and as for himself? How capable and great, he can use the deceased's tone to boast and brag, which is an excellent opportunity to boast.</p>
<p>Hearing of the death of a celebrity or important person is also an opportunity to boast. Regardless of whether he knows the celebrity or important person or not, he can sincerely make a funeral couplet or inscription, saying how the deceased "deeply relied on" him, how they "opened their hearts and stomachs" to him, how they "listened to him and followed his advice." Fortunately, the deceased is dead and cannot rise up to prove it. Let you boast to your heart's content, and bystanders cannot know. This is also an excellent opportunity to boast.</p>
<p>Holding a meeting is also an opportunity to boast, but boasting here also carries a bit of flattery. On the one hand, he boasts about himself, and on the other hand, he can also send sidelong glances to the deceased's family, which is originally a win-win situation, because the deceased is dead and can't be flattered, but his surviving family members can still be flattered, so the flattery has an aftertaste. This is also an excellent opportunity to boast and flatter.</p>
<p>However, you can boast as much as you want, but the first condition is that your grandfather and mother must die, or that a celebrity or important person must die. When they die, there is no proof. "Only the dead know what's in their stomachs," so you can boast at will, even if bystanders laugh their teeth off, he can ignore it. I have nothing to say about this kind of person, I can only deeply admire his thick skin and quick mind. In the past, I wrote two verses about boasting and flattery, which are now recorded below and offered as a gift.</p>
<p>Verse on Boasting</p>
<p>Asked what is boasting, its wonders are endless, let you say it traverses heaven and earth, originally form is emptiness.</p>
<p>Verse on Flattery</p>
<p>Flattery has many means, only one word is moderate, calling a cow or a horse is casual, the face is thick with iron armor ten layers.</p>
<h3>After Watching the Public Performance of the John Drama Society</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>It's already been almost a year in a hurry.</p>
<p>A year ago, I and several comrades wanted to organize the John Drama Society and have a more meaningful public performance before Christmas, but in the end, due to various limitations of objective conditions and practical difficulties, the plan to organize the John Drama Society finally fell through.</p>
<p>However, I didn't expect that a year later today, thanks to the hard work of several classmates in the school, the John Drama Society was finally organized and finally gave a public performance. Being able to sprout this green bud in a very barren and dry desert, I felt an inexplicable gratification.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yu was invited to be the director, but because Mr. Sun Yu was busy with his work, the actual responsibility was borne by Mr. Huang Jiade.</p>
<p>The plays are three: Tian Han's "Death of a Famous Actor," Chen Bingquan's "Turtle," and Xiong Foxi's "Executioner."</p>
<p>It seems that there is no need to discuss the script of "Death of a Famous Actor" itself here. Here, the three acts have been changed to two acts, and with the efforts of several actors, the effect obtained is enough to be proud of. However, Qin Fuji, who played Master Yang, acted a little too much and became somewhat like a civilized drama. Wang Jinsheng's Liu Zhensheng was a little lacking. As for the female roles played by Lan Yeshen and Lan Yeqing, although they worked very hard later, it always felt a bit forced for men to dress up as women. When their affectations caused laughter from the audience, I couldn't help but think of the executioner's wife's dialogue in "Executioner": "Don't laugh, laughing makes people feel uncomfortable." Really, I felt uncomfortable in my heart, and at the same time, I felt a kind of shame and indignation. Friends, don't forget the black hand hiding behind you!</p>
<p>The second play is Chen Bingquan's self-written, self-directed, and self-performed "Turtle." In addition to his talent for acting, which is worthy of our praise, this script, which is purely about the jealousy and quarrels between young masters and young mistresses, is not as meaningful as "Death of a Famous Actor" and "Executioner." However, his demeanor is also too frivolous.</p>
<p>The last play is "Executioner," which is a relatively commendable one among Xiong Foxi's past plays. Perhaps because the stage was too large, the scenery here was too empty and monotonous. Mr. Zong Weigeng's lighting was very good here. Zhang Shirong, who played the "Executioner," was very serious. Zhu Wenji, who played the rent collector, was a little unfamiliar. Zhang Xunli worked very hard, and Lan Yeshen, who played the executioner's wife, was better than in "Death of a Famous Actor."</p>
<p>Of the effects received by the three plays, the last one was relatively more successful. And the national music played by the Xiaodian Orchestra did indeed evoke a leisurely nostalgic mood in people.</p>
<p>I understand the limitations of objective conditions and practical difficulties very clearly, but this public performance was able to achieve such satisfactory results. The hard work and spirit of the members are indeed worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Friends, I hope you cherish this sprout growing in the barren and dry desert: I am blessing you here!</p>
<h3>Random Sketches of School Life, Part Two - Humor</h3>
<h3>Beard</h3>
<p>— Chiyo-ko</p>
<p>Looking out from the window lattice at the high wall across the way, the pale yellow winter shadows were already slanting westward. I felt as if I had been sitting here all afternoon. The tobacco tin of "Buy cigarettes" beside my hand was gradually emptying, and I was idly stroking my chin when I was surprised to feel the prickly stubble. This was a new discovery. Finally, as if anticipating a major event for half a day, I searched out the broken mirror from the desk drawer.</p>
<p>An incomplete image appeared in the mirror. I thought someone else was standing behind me, but in this lonely small building, besides the lonely owner, only "Haru," huddled by the door, could guarantee that a stranger had never been seen. Still, distrustful, I turned my head to glance. On the wall hung a twenty-four-inch enlarged photograph, which was definitely not the figure in the mirror.</p>
<p>As if in a desert-like state of mind, I was suddenly disturbed. I stood up, flicked the cigarette ash, and searched out a photograph of myself from a pile of books covered in dust. Although I couldn't remember which year it was, I clearly remembered that it was taken on the same day as the twenty-four-inch enlarged photograph. Wasn't she young? How could the figure in the mirror have changed so much?</p>
<p>Sitting down again, I noticed that the sunlight on the wall had quietly disappeared. I had calculated thousands of times that it comes and goes quietly. I had even tried to trace its whereabouts, but where could I go to find it? This question has been缠绕ing me ever since. No, I should temporarily abandon it now and compare these two different shadows and images in detail.</p>
<p>This is truly a miracle; there is not the slightest resemblance in any part, so it's no wonder I thought someone else was standing behind me. Before one question was resolved, I was缠绕ed by a second. So I tried my best to explain to myself that one of these two must be me. First, I used the mirror to test it. When I pointed it at the wall, it reflected the twenty-four-inch enlarged photograph. When I pointed it at the corner of the door, it reflected "Haru's" weary state. When I pointed it at my clothes, it reflected the tattered cotton robe. Although this mirror</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>is broken, it is still as accurate as before, reflecting a beautiful image of its owner. Then, the photograph must be wrong. I checked the back and saw a line of small words: "Taken in the spring of 1929 by the West Lake." What am I supposed to do? I clearly remember visiting Hangzhou in the spring of 1929. The twenty-four-inch enlarged photograph on the wall also has a background of swaying green willows. It can be determined that the figure in the mirror is me, and the photograph is also me. Involuntarily, I raised my hand to stroke my chin. Oh, that prickly beard, can you tell me where the me photographed in 1929 has gone? And where has the owner of that twenty-four-inch enlarged photograph gone? Hmph, did they come and go so quietly!</p>
<p>"Haru, do you know why you're barking?"</p>
<p>As it perked up its ears and barked wildly, the restaurant delivery man brought the night meal. The sky was completely dark. Naturally, the pale yellow winter shadows were impossible to trace. Very well, let everything be in darkness. I will not see that twenty-four-inch enlarged photograph, nor will I see these two different images and shadows. But I am still stroking the prickly beard! Old questions, new questions, will forever缠绕 me, even in the darkness.</p>
<h3>Mad Woman</h3>
<p>— Yu Jiong</p>
<p>The piercing cold wind howled, blowing against the few sailboats on the Wusong seashore. The vast seawater was constantly beaten by the cold wind, creating rhythmic sounds and ceaseless waves. Due to the excessive force of the sea wind, the waves crashed onto the pebbles. I enjoyed walking back and forth on the pebble road. During my free time, I would walk with my hands in my pockets, circling back and forth on the pebble road. Although the weather was cold, the beautiful scenery ultimately stirred up people's desire to stroll. One day, after dinner, the tide was rising and falling on the seashore. The road along the shore, which used to be covered with green grass, was now buried and the path was no longer visible. The setting sun cast a beautiful seascape even in winter. Countless ships, flying various flags, emitted whistling sounds, startling the fish hidden in the sea, which leaped and jumped, making quite a sight. Suddenly, a girl with a round face, wearing a green scarf, walked past me alone, strolling along the roadside. I shifted my gaze from the center of the sea and focused it on her. My heart began to feel uneasy. Why was someone walking along as if lost in thought? Could she be thinking of "suicide"? A suspicious thought lurked in my subconscious without being spoken when a familiar restaurant owner, Chen Ermazi, chased after her, his attitude quite nasty, closely following her footsteps, as if mumbling something. I became even more suspicious. Could he be trying to take advantage of her? Why would she let him chase her without saying a word? I could no longer contain my curiosity. Finally, I stopped the familiar restaurant owner, Chen Ermazi, and asked him why he was following this woman. Who exactly was she? Infinite anxiety was evident on her face, revealing how many secrets were hidden deep in her heart! In the moment that I stopped Chen Ermazi and chased after her again, her expression turned to relief, no longer as urgent as before. After Chen Ermazi explained that she owed him money for meals and gave a detailed account of her situation, I learned that she was a mad woman with a nervous condition, and that this so-called mad woman was actually a classmate who had entered the school with me more than half a year ago. Usually, because there were so many students, I hardly seemed to recognize her at all, until this day, when I learned her background.</p>
<p>From then on, after returning to school, I often heard about her past and her mad behavior in school. It was said that three years ago, she was the ninth concubine of Officer A in Sichuan. In this position, she was constantly subjected to the high pressure and arbitrary beatings from the eight higher-ranking wives. Moreover, when Officer A was promoted to commander, she was finally abandoned! Since then, after experiencing countless shocks in her life, her nerves had long been somewhat unclear! At school, she often let out loud cries and acted in ways that made people laugh. At these times, who could truly sympathize with her drifting fate? If someone truly comforted her, tears would stream from her eyes. We knew that she was not without reason or emotion, but that her reason and emotion were obscured and confused by the harsh reality!</p>
<p>Time is truly like flowing water. After the Japanese artillery fire destroyed C University, the whereabouts of this mad woman were said to be wandering everywhere. However, her deep, melodious, and mournful cries, mixed with the howling of the north wind, sometimes still echo in my ears.</p>
<h3>New Books Sold as Waste Paper</h3>
<p>— Song Yuan</p>
<p>Last year, bookstores selling new books by the pound was already alarming; now, bookstores are running prominent advertisements on newspaper front pages, proclaiming "New books sold as waste paper," which can't help but be shocking and heart-wrenching, lamenting the depression of the book industry to such an extent, and sensing the dim and lusterless future of culture.</p>
<p>Originally, cheap books are what scholars like most. In this era of rural economic bankruptcy and urban industrial depression, scholars have no choice but to buy books to satisfy their desire for knowledge, and the cost of books is equivalent to the cost of living. Cheap books mean a reduction in living expenses. Selling new books as waste paper should be considered a phenomenon that is very beneficial to scholars and the future of culture. However, we must know that bookstores are profit-making institutions for merchants, and their purpose in selling books is to make money. Now, running prominent advertisements, "New books sold as waste paper," clearly tells us, "No one is buying books, this is terrible!" Why is no one buying books? A simple sentence can answer: Scholars have no money. Since the cost of books for scholars is equivalent to the cost of living, and now that all industries are depressed, scholars are struggling to make a living. The cost of buying books beyond this living expense is naturally subject to a reduction policy, regardless. What the cultural cause relies on to promote, besides newspapers and magazines, is only new books. Now, scholars are not buying new books, so that "new books are sold as waste paper," the cultural future is truly worrying. It's hard to say that in the future, the new books of all bookstores will be sold as waste paper, and the cigarette shops and general stores will take the new books page by page and use them to wrap peanuts and groceries.</p>
<p>The new book industry has declared this year as the "magazine year," which has already told us that the sales of new books are not good, and only magazines are good business. Now, a certain bookstore is running a prominent advertisement, "New books sold as waste paper," and the purchasing power of new books is not as good as the purchasing power of magazines, which is further proof. However, in this so-called "magazine year," has the purchasing power of magazines increased compared to before? This is also a question worth paying attention to. As far as I know, the Commercial Press's "Eastern Miscellany" is an old brand with the largest sales, but this year it doesn't seem to be better than before. Also, literary magazines such as "Les Contemporains" and "Literature Quarterly" are also considered the best-selling publications, but this year they also don't seem to be better than last year. "Les Contemporains" magazine has even been suspended due to the poor business of the bookstore.</p>
<p>The society is in such a state of depression in all industries, the national economy is collapsing and bankrupting day by day, the purchasing power of new books is falling sharply, the cultural future is really terrible!</p>

<p>The fiery flames stir the clouds in the distant sky. Young Zhou Lang burned Red Cliff. Moreover, it is said that Wolong returned to Xiakou. Immediately, the order was given to dispatch heroes. After issuing the order, Guan Gong was angry. Why didn't Guan be sent to stop Cao? Kongming was forced to have no choice but to tell the whole story. He said he was afraid that he would consider the old friendship and not recognize the blade to behead him. Guan Gong's liver fire was provoked. The military order was written on the spot and handed over in person. He hurriedly mounted his horse and advanced forward. Five hundred soldiers followed him with their swords. Suddenly, it was reported that the enemy troops were in a panic. Zhang Liao was the one who was wearing a crooked helmet and unloaded armor in front. A group of civil and military officials were haggard. Cao Cao didn't even wear a robe. With a roar of cannons, the mountains and valleys shook. Guan Gong stood on his horse with his sword in hand. Ambush soldiers intercepted and fought. He was so frightened that his heart was broken and he dared not escape. The Cao bandit knew that his feelings could be moved. He knelt down and begged bitterly with tears like a tide. Guan Gong couldn't bear it when he saw it. He had to stroke his long beard and look behind the formation. The bandit general took the opportunity to fly his horse over. Suddenly, he heard a thunderous roar and it was difficult to sit firmly. They all fell off their saddles and dared not run.</p>

<p>Supplement of Shenbao in this city Film Special</p>
<h3>Basic Qualifications of an Actress in the Words of Several Movie Moguls (Part Two)</h3>
<p>David Ward Griffith, the great director, needs no introduction. Anyone who has seen a movie once or twice in the past twenty-five years knows Griffith's name. He "discovered" and single-handedly promoted several stars, including Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, Raoul Walsh, Van Dyke (also a famous director), Lionel Barrymore, Richard Barthelmess, Constance Talmadge, Norma Shearer, and others. He also gave Sylvia Sidney, Claudette Colbert, and Giselle Morlais their first screen tests. According to him, the most important qualification for a woman who wants to enter the modern film industry is talent. He said, "In the silent film era, a woman only needed to be beautiful on camera and agile in her movements to become an actress, but now, everything has changed. It is now doubly difficult to gain a foothold in the film industry compared to the past. Even the most insignificant parts must be given to experienced people because only experienced people know how to recite lines and make the film a complete, living thing. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for an inexperienced woman to enter the film industry now without any prior preparation. She should practice acting and dialogue in advance, and the best place to practice is in a small theater troupe. Hoping to become a movie star by working as an extra or in a minor role on a film set and rising step by step is never likely to succeed. What is needed on a film set now is vocal work. There is no better actress in sound films than Helen Hayes, but she had worked in the theater for many years before joining the film industry. Many other actresses who have become famous in the sound film industry also came from the theater, where they had already gained many essential experiences on the stage."</p>
<p>Lilyan Tashman's last director before her death was Chester Erskine. After Tashman's death, he praised her, saying, "She was the least temperamental and the easiest actress to direct. Although she was suffering from a serious illness, an illness that she knew would end her life, but which we did not know, she still worked every day from nine in the morning to five in the afternoon. She did not ask for any special treatment, and she worked harmoniously with other actors, from beginning to end, meticulously. Her death shook the entire film city." Erskine said of the selection of new actresses: "The first condition I look for in her is her appearance, that is, her appearance on camera. The second condition is her expression. If she has some personality, her expression when she speaks, her expression when she walks, and her expression when she sits and stands can all reveal her personality. The third condition is her ability. Ability cannot be discovered immediately, but once it is discovered, it must be considered when she is filming her second film. However, one thing that all women who want to join the film industry must understand is that being an actress is hard work. Those who think that becoming a movie star will bring endless wealth and glory are bound to be disappointed. A person who cannot devote themselves wholeheartedly is bound to fail miserably. Success requires years of work, and there is no shortcut."</p>
<p>Arthur Hopkins is a stage mogul who hired Katharine Hepburn to play in "Pride and Prejudice" at the Barrymore Theatre. He has the following opinions on how to choose actors: "The most important condition, of course, is general suitability for the work and special suitability for a particular role. Suitability includes appearance, speech, knowledge, and personality, etc. It is a mixture of various qualifications, not just one characteristic. Experience is desirable, but not essential. New talents can improve quickly under proper guidance if they have the qualities of an excellent actor. When rehearsing a play, the important roles are always cast first, and then the secondary roles are sought. Sometimes, you only need to read the script to know in advance who should play which role, without having to look for it."</p>
<p>There is also Eddie Dowling, a famous actor, producer, and director. He is currently directing a song and dance satire film. He said, "The first thing I look for is talent. People without talent are absolutely useless to us. But talent is not something you can see at a glance. For example, if there is a room full of new people you don't know, all you can do is pick out a few people with outstanding personalities or particularly transcendent attitudes. Beauty is certainly important, but it is secondary to talent. Many big stars are not very beautiful. A person with eight or nine points of beauty who has talent is much better than a person with ten points of beauty who has mediocre talent." From what has been said above, you can draw a rough and reliable conclusion: "Beauty, especially facial beauty, is very useful, but it is not absolutely essential. You must have other qualifications to succeed!" (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "The Cremation Case"</h3>
<p>— Stone Axe</p>
<p>Murder on The</p>
<p>Blackboard丨Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>After continuously showing many detective films, it seems that we have been fascinated by the great detective Sherlock Holmes. However, even if they are wonderful, we should be tired of watching them, let alone this "Cremation Case" after the "Goose Pond Tragedy"?</p>
<p>The simplicity of the story lies in the fact that it follows the old tune of others, making the corpses disappear without a trace, showing the strangeness of the strange. But unfortunately, we have seen enough of this old trick of destroying corpses. Moreover, this is not something that is reasonable, so in this respect, the script has lost its center of gravity. In addition, the director's skills are weak. While watching the play, we have to study it carefully, which is like being a detective again. This is because the whole play lacks a tense atmosphere, so you can think calmly while watching the play. I think the pretentiousness of the protagonist (Headmistress Withers, played by Edna May Oliver) is a bit too much.</p>
<p>In terms of exposition, it is too fragmented, and in terms of layout, it is so rigid. We are simply lost in the direction of the camera positions in several scenes in the cellar. When Inspector派拍剛 went out to take out a cigar to light, the first scene immediately followed by taking out the second cigar, we can easily see the negligence of the cut. The humor in the dialogue is not considered high-level, and the ending is a bit of a dog's tail.</p>
<p>As for the translation of the title "Murder on the Blackboard", the idea is still novel, but things such as poison, pistols, vases, and women's shoes are not uncommon in detective films. Moreover, here it is just that the name of the murderer is hidden in a short piece of music written on the blackboard, which is really very clumsy!</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Watching "Hundred Flowers Continent"</h3>
<p>— Warrior</p>
<p>After watching "Hundred Flowers Continent," I couldn't help but celebrate for Tianyi. Really, "Hundred Flowers Continent," in terms of the consciousness of the script, has surpassed many of Tianyi's past films and is more meaningful than "The Deep Spring in the Red Chamber" and "Spring Night Serenade."</p>
<p>Although "Hundred Flowers Continent" still cannot escape the love disputes between men and women, it tells us that love is painful, love is the demon that buries our future, and the enemy that deceives our youth. We should abandon love and strive for the country and society to create our great future!</p>
<p>The purpose of the play is to convey such meaning, but because the playwright cannot correctly understand reality, and the director's technique is weak and powerless, it inevitably destroys the power of the whole play, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Chen Yumei's Zhou Yunxiang and Ye Qiuxin's Li Guifang worked harder, and Li Ying was also good, but a bit over the top.</p>
<p>The photography and scenery are good, but the subtitles are a bit too many.</p>
<p>In short, "Hundred Flowers Continent" should be a more successful and worthwhile work to watch compared to Tianyi Company's past works.</p>
<h3>Movie Gossip</h3>
<p>Twentieth Century Company plans to bring "The Mighty Barnum" to the screen, with Adolph Menjou playing Barnum's partner, Wallace Beery's wife Jean Harlow playing Mrs. Barnum, and Wallace Beery playing Barnum.</p>
<p>Mary Nolan's estate has now been fully accounted for, slightly exceeding 50,000 pounds.</p>
<p>MGM, in view of the business success of "Tarzan and His Mate," has specially invited Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan to co-star in a new Tarzan film, and the location team has already set off for Africa for on-location filming.</p>
<p>Twentieth Century Company is now looking for a dog as amazing as Rin Tin Tin to co-star with Frank Lloyd in "The Call of the Wild," adapted from Jack London's novel.</p>
<p>Eddie Cantor's recently starring comedy "Kid Million" has been completed and will soon leave the United States for England.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours"</h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>What we see here are fragments of Shanghai's darkness. The picture has lost its coherence, and everywhere shows stiffness and unnaturalness. Of course, we should forgive the director for the sake of the environment, it is not his fault!</p>
<p>However, this film still has its merits. At least, in terms of its content, we can see that it is a completely true portrayal, not an empty or ethereal one. The most successful part, I think, is several contrasts. For example, he writes that a child is seriously injured and is about to die, but he has no money to hire a doctor; and on the other hand, he writes that a comprador's wife pays a veterinary hospital twenty taels of silver. This contrast between people being worse than animals is so profound, moving, and powerful! Only a true portrayal can touch people's hearts, I think.</p>
<p>Although the picture has lost its coherence, each individual picture is still very good. For example, the street scenes of Shanghai reflected in the opening and ending scenes are so clear and beautiful!</p>
<p>Although the director has been heard to have some negligence, generally speaking, it is satisfactory. In many places, we can see his caution in handling this story. However, here he seems to only focus on the main characters, and neglects the rest of the actors, so that the plot of the whole film is a bit uncoordinated, such as Hu Wenlong, who can be said to have no expression at all. In addition, the extras in the dog racing arena and dance hall are also too stiff.</p>
<h3>Tianyi Tidbits</h3>
<p>▲ "Hundred Flowers Continent" is released, and the audience regards it as a masterpiece, and Chen Yumei's acting skills and Wen Yimin's directorial skills are especially praised.</p>
<p>▲ "Model Youth" was completed yesterday, and the art department is rushing to produce subtitles.</p>
<p>▲ Nanhai beauty Hu Dieying came to Shanghai and stayed in Tianyi Village. After a short rest, she will work under the mercury lamp.</p>
<p>▲ The sound blockbuster "Renzhu" (i.e., "Empty Valley Orchid") is Tianyi's super-special work for the second half of this year, and the release date is just around the corner.</p>
<p>▲ Chen Yumei will co-star in a film with Hu Dieying, and the script is yet to be decided.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Golden Lotus Tribulation (Have Heart) (Four)</h3>
<p>— Uncle Min</p>
<p>Jimmy told Sally in the car that he would soon get a car like this. He said, "Do you know who's driving for you now? He's a big shot, James Farrell, the local manager." Sally's deep black eyes widened involuntarily, revealing a joyful light. She exclaimed softly, "Oh, Jimmy, have you been promoted?" Jimmy nodded, "Yes. Out of many people, I am the only one who has been promoted to local manager." At this time, Sally was happy for Jimmy and for herself, being able to be in the same car with this local manager, she temporarily forgot that she was a lame girl. But soon her dream was awakened, because Jimmy suddenly slammed on the brakes and said to Sally, "Do you know where this is? Roseland Ballroom. Let's go down and dance." Sally was shocked by what he said, and all the happiness disappeared. She could neither enter the ballroom nor tell him why. She couldn't say it on the one hand, and she sat still on the other, letting Jimmy urge her. Later, she suddenly thought of a plan, rejected his request to dance, and Jimmy seemed very satisfied and did not insist. Such an evening passed quickly and happily. When Jimmy sent Sally to her doorstep, Sally got out of the car by herself and told Jimmy not to get out. She said she wanted to stand and watch him drive the car away. But Jimmy refused. He said, "I must send you to your door. I have a special reason." Sally couldn't help but wonder, "What special reason do you have?" Jimmy said, "I think, if you are really happy, like you said, maybe you will let me kiss you for a moment." As he spoke, he looked at Sally with infinite hope. Sally hesitated for a while, then said, "Do you have to kiss people at the door?" Jimmy heard this, immediately hugged Sally in his arms, cried out "Angel," and kissed her. Sally was so happy with his kiss, and after a while, she pushed Jimmy away and said, "Okay, you go. I'll just stand here and wave goodbye to you." Jimmy looked at her reluctantly and said, "Okay, Angel, I'll see you tomorrow." He said and jumped into the car and drove away.</p>
<p>After Jimmy left, it wasn't until he returned to the company and put the car away that he found Sally's dog in his car. He jumped out of the car, and the dog followed him. It started barking. Jimmy hurriedly stopped it, but it was too late. The night watchman had already heard it and walked over. Jimmy quickly picked up the dog and ran into the company. He ran in the hallway and hid in a small room next to the hall, which was directly opposite the door of the cashier's room. No sooner said than done, the night watchman had already chased in. He had just walked to the door of the cashier's room when suddenly a person came out of the cashier's room with money. He walked behind the night watchman and hit him on the head with something. The night watchman immediately fell down. At this time, Jimmy's hand loosened, and the dog immediately窜了下去. It chased the robber. When the robber saw the dog coming up, he kicked it away. Jimmy quickly came out of the small room, walked through the hall, and wanted to lead the dog in. At this moment, the dog howled madly and flew straight out of another room, indeed being kicked out by the robber. Jimmy quickly hugged it and hid under the table. He looked around silently. After a while, he saw a hand stretching out from the room to turn off the light switch. The person turned off the light and ran away.</p>
<p>When the person reached out to turn off the switch, Jimmy saw a tattoo on his arm, which looked like a silver dollar. After Jimmy waited for the robber to escape, he immediately took Sally's dog and escaped. (To be continued)</p>
