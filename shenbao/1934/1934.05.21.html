<p>— 英</p>
<p>籌備已久之全國財政會議本日在南京開幕與會人物除財部要員及各省市財政負責長官外。尙有負社會物望之專家多人。聚朝野於一堂謀度支</p>
<p>之改革。獻籌决策。集思廣益。詎得謂非今日之盛事耶。然以目前形勢觀之。則尙須亟加以十分之勉力焉。猶憶第一次全國財政會議之召集尙爲十七年七月間事。其時國民政府已將北洋軍閥推翻。開始與國民爲更新之運動。故頗擬結束雜亂無章之戰時財政。而樹立發展生產之國民財政。吾人鑒於當時政府之所宣傳。民意之所表示。未嘗不認爲前途光明。然而韶光易駛。六年去矣。今乃以召集第二次會議聞。而會議之目的。除整理税收。調節開支等數端外。尙未見有進一步更新計劃之表示。今日各種事業。百孔千瘡。財政當道。縱李賢勞。恐亦不免有心餘力絀之嘆。今茲會議。出於勵精圖治奮發有爲之動機。固爲國人所共見。惟能否不蹈往者之覆轍。則非會議席上可得而左右。無己。姑就我國財政之最大病態三點。指而出之可乎。第一。支出膨脹之不合理也。查中央預算之支出。在北京政府時代。每年恒不過五萬萬元左右。國府奠都南京而後。支出膨脹不己。而生產建設之經費。仍未見加厚。以目前一年度而論。預算支出己達八二八·九二一·九六四元之鉅。而軍費一項。己佔四一五·六○○·○○○元。此外實際支出。未見於報告者。或猶不止此數也。</p>
<p>第二。經常收入之萎縮也。現時中央收入。仍以關鹽兩税爲大宗。關鹽屬於物税性質。較諸英美以人民所得税爲收入要目者。優劣懸殊矣。近年商業蕭條。工商敝疲。東北淪亡以後。税源之損失甚巨。於是中央經常收入。大受打擊。節流不成。轉謀開源。公債之發行。與時俱積。特税之收入。亦不易速除。最近前財長宋子文氏西北歸來。嘗謂特税『苦於無法移替。卒致烟禁難施。』誠慨乎其言之矣。</p>
<p>第三。賦税制度之窳敗也。吾國賦税制度。窳敗久矣。國府累以改革税制。爲勵精圖治之一端。然歷年以來。舊税不减。新捐日密。中央之功令如山。地方之弁髦如故。坐是貨物不能流通。生產不能發達。皆因税制腐敗。爲厲之也。吾國不能於第一次財政會議之情勢下積極樹立一新耳目之財政政策而加以實行深覺坐失時機。今則商業之蕭條益甚國際之侵凌益張上述三點之病態。能否不至於加重　進於改善。全視今後之努力如何深望出席財政會議諸君。皆能認定此三點對象。製定確切可行之補救方案不求理論之動聽。而但求實際之適用。斯諸君之職責盡矣至其能否盡量推　行則有待於將來實行者之决心與毅力何如耳。</p>

<p>吳縣蠶區、大致分（一）光福（二）木凟、（三）洞庭東西　山（四）香山四區、其中除木凟一區、現仍墨守土法、不知改良外、其餘均己購用改良蠶種、採用新法養育、光福一區、由吳縣農業推廣所設立指導處敎導農民育蠶、已有六七年之歷史、成績頗佳、今春蠶事、亦甚順利、惟蘇農校指導之光福善人橋一帶、其早帮蠶因受天時影響、夭殤甚多、晚期尙在頭眠中、當不致再生變故、洞庭東山、農民育蠶者較少、西山仍舊繁榮、該處改良蠶種、以寳塔及虎牌一種、佔絶對多數、養育經過亦佳、香山爲一工業區、農事以育蠶爲主、前年秋間、由葑溪蠶種製造塲出資開辦指導所、敎導農民改用新法育蠶、經三年之努力改良、採用新法之蠶戶、由五六十家增至一千餘家、每年繭量增多、品質亦見優良、今春蠶事、發育特佳、大有豐收之望、土種蠶多死亡年來已漸絶跡、無錫向爲蠶種最大市塲、歷年蠶汎、均可銷售改良種六十萬張、今春因農民經濟益趨破產、購買力薄弱、僅售去四十萬張、該縣指導所、向山縣立農塲主辦、今春復有華新絲廠出鉏資舉辦大規模指導所、實行敎導蠶戶、目下早帮蠶、已過　眠、晚帮尙在頭眠、發衣良好、收成可望、</p>
<p>江蘇蠶種統制節、業由江浙蠶業改進管理會議决、於今秋實行劃分模範區與非模範區、模範區由繭行於收繭時、每担抽取十二元、俾將欵項購買蠶種、强迫農民養育改良蠶種、非模範區則另行設立公賣所、以便農民就近購買、該會現已劃定無錫縣及吳縣洞庭東西山爲模範區、最近並將在滸墅關·光福·横經·香山·四處、設立蠶種公賣所、（申時社）</p>

<p>— 千家駒</p>
<p>但是這種農村放欵、究竟能不能把農民從高利貸的囚籠中解放出來呢、這裏我紀錄一一段主持該區農民放欵的高元勳先生親口對我們説的話、一這種放欵在農村中的作用是微乎其微的、農民依然要求援於高利貸</p>
<p>、依然受困於商人資本的高度剝削下、因爲這裏的貧民太多了、區區三五萬元錢、實在是杯水車薪、於事無濟、據我們的估計、本區内的農民負債額要達三十萬元、如要救濟他們、至少要有五十萬塊錢、才能眞正免除高利貸資本對他們的剝削、其實、高利貸還不要緊、最可怕的是商人的操縱農產物價格、例如這裏－有一家收屯舖廣興隆、他們一當春荒時、就借花生麩或谷米給農民、約定將來歸還蔗糖、這種花生麩本不過値價二三元的、這時却以最高的價格八九元借出去、以月利三分起息、等到農民將甘蔗收成後、這時因背了滿身的債、不能不立刻拿到榨糖舖去榨、這種榨糖舖也是廣興隆他們所開的、於是就可以收取筆乎續費、當然其中可以拿些便宜的、待糖榨成後、收糖的公司也是他們、這時立刻又可以把糖價壓得很低、譬如柳州的糖、當價高時（八九月間）本可以每擔賣十三四元的、這時出糖時、約十一文</p>
<p>十二月）却祗能賣五六元、經由這種的榨取、農村才一天天貧困下去、商人或地主才肥胖起來了、現在向我們這裏借欵的百分之九十　是佃農、這些佃農都是由自耕農破產下來的、</p>
<p>高先生這段話是値得我們深切地注意的、因爲商人資本之剝削農民、不僅柳州爲然、全中國莫不皆然、而農村放欵之因資金缺乏難收實效、也不僅是墾殖水利試辦區所感受的困難、而是所有中國的所謂農民銀行、信用放欵合作社、所共同感受着的困難、試辦區的人口總共不過四萬、而所負的債額已達三十餘萬元、那麽廣西一千二百萬人口、負債額至少當達一萬萬元左右、這樣嚴重的農村金融問題、是不是單靠信用放欵所能解决、這也許値得我們反省了吧、</p>
<p>除農林機關外、柳州又是廣西省營工廠的試辦地、近年桂省新辦的三種工業－硫酸廠·酒精廠··機械廠、除硫酸廠設在梧州外、餘均設於柳州之鷄喇（離城約十里）硫酸與酒精同爲近代基本之化學工業、機械廠之重要更爲吾人所周知、因之我們在柳之最後一天、就去參觀他們、</p>
<p>酒精廠之籌設、原始於民國十六年、當時桂省當局鋭意開闢公路、因而慮及汽車燃料之消耗、以火酒可供替代汽油之用故於廣西酒精廠的籌備、後以經費拮据、進行遲滯、十八年軍興以後、政局擾攘、遂全部陷於停頓中、直到民國二十年、兩廣合作後又繼續開辦、二十一年六月遂珔式開工、該廠每日工作八小時、約得火酒八百斤、三天之後、分溜一次、可得九址八度之酒精一千四百斤、酒精的原料暫用桔水、所謂桔水就是甘蔗榨糖後之蒸溜水、皆係柳州土產、現在各方商人都知酒精廠需用桔水有存貨的、就持貨來廠試騐優劣、然後商定價格、交付定銀、按期［運回工廠存儲、但因桔水的供給有限、而且成本也太貴了、現在他們每製成斤酒精成本要　角七分、再加上統税運費等等、運到廣州成本　要四角左右、而廣州的售價也不過此數、據説他們也未嘗不知道用桔水成本之昂貴、但因草創之時當局所懸念者、不在成本之重輕、而在機器合用與否、開工後、出品好不好、有沒有銷路、這幾項問題、所以暫時桔水來試騐、他們原來的計劃、本是想用雜糧的、所以廠址亦不設在交通利便、地當衝要的梧州、而設在地曠人稀、什糧豐富的柳州、他們現在正計劃以雜糧造酒精以雜糧製酒精後所剩下之糟粕、飼養家畜復以家畜賣價、換取雜糧、兩項開支、適可相抵、這樣就可以把原料費完全省下來了、現在柳州酒精廠的產品、百分之九十爲銷往廣州、我們深信酒精工業如能發達起來、不惟足以抵制桂省之一部分漏巵、且也是我國民族工業中最有希望者之一種、不過觀了柳州酒精廠後、有點我們認爲美中不足的、就是該廠自改隸工商局後、（昔隸建設廳、十　年三月後歸工商局）局長楊綽　先生將他們的會計亦歸併於工商局、以致不但酒精的成本多少、銷塲如何、售價若干、廠中人完全莫明其妙、就連我們問起了該廠最近是賺錢還是折本、損益如何的問題、自廠長以至會計主任都瞠目不知所答、這一方面固然是楊君做事負責精神的表現、但一廠而無獨立的會計、我們却終期期以爲不可的、</p>

<p>案查民衆等二十四家公司、呈請改訂捲烟税級一事、其呈文係直呈本署、其後民衆代表人黃子屏提議書、及捲烟公會會員大會審查意見書、　由捲烟公會轉署、綜其大體、原呈係請求改級、在文内僅述及七級爲最有利於華商、並無何等方案提出、但其所作税級算式表則、又主張三級、並以八十元爲低級税額、是其對於級數之主要意見、先後已自相抵觸其後續擬提議書、忽然另作主張、謂低級税八十元可以更改、是提議書之主要目的、不啻爲减税請求、與原呈僅以待遇平均、改訂税級、爲目的者大異、至該會員大會審查税制委員會之審查意見書、不過將原呈及提議書所主張者、加以擴充解釋、對於改善税級、仍未擬出具體方案、可資考慮、其原呈及兩書所採統計、惜均未能研究明確、茲特舉其主張較爲重要者、合併審核、順次説明於後、（凡原呈曾列舉之事項、如在提議書及審查意見書又重舉者、卽以原呈爲主、歸納審核、以免重複、）（一）原呈列舉、捲烟統税開辦及改税時間之錯誤、原呈云、捲烟統税、係於民國十八年開辦、十九年十一月、二十年二月、二十一年三月凡三經改税、由十八年七月至十九年十一月爲七級税時代、十九年十一月至二十年二月、爲舊三級時代、二十年二月至二十一年三月、爲新三級税時代、二十一年三月至今、爲二級税時代、本署查捲烟統税、係於民國十七年二月開辦、十七年十二月、十九年十月、二十年二月、二十一年三月、二十二年十一月、凡五經改税、卽由十七年二月至十一月爲舊七級時代、十七年十二月至十九年九月、爲新七級時代、十九年十月至二十年一月、爲舊三級時代、二十年二月至二十一年三月二十日、爲新三級時代、二十一年三月二十一日至二十二年十二月四日、爲舊　級時代、二十二年十二月五日迄今、爲新二級時代（二）原呈叙述華商倒閉家數之失實、原呈云、七級税時代、華商共有一百五六十家、二級税時紛紛倒閉、今則僅存四五十家、本署查捲烟商號之組織有兩種、一係設有機廠之商號、普通稱爲烟廠、一係不設廠而委托他廠代捲之商號、普通稱爲烟公司或烟號、據擋案考察、烟商納税購花有案者、二十年内、烟廠有八十七家、又不設機廠而委托他廠代捲者九十家、合共一百七十七家、又二十一年内、烟廠八十三字、不設而委托代捲者四十四家、合共一百三十九家、故以三年總數比較、烟商之購花納税者、爲數恒在一百四十家左右、其中烟廠總占八十至九十家、尙能維持平衡、並無原呈所云一百五六十家、今則僅存四五十家之事實、（三）原呈釋及附列英美銷用印花比</p>
<p>較表與納税數目表、均有錯誤、關於銷用印花之解釋、據原呈云、銷用印花數目、在三級税時代、英美平均數目爲三零四七二、其他公司、爲六八四二二、是英美銷烟數量、僅及其他公司之四成零、不及五成、在二級税時代、英美平均數目、爲四八八零八、其他公司、爲四四三二三、則英美銷烟數量、已此諸其他公司、超過四八五、又關於納税數目之解釋、據原呈云、三級税時代、英美烟公司平均數目爲二·四一七·四零三·八二二其他烟公司、爲二·零六·二五二·六四七、是英美之負担多於華商四十一萬零、在二級税時代英美烟公司平均數目、爲二·七二六·三九二·五二二、其他烟公司爲二·五五四·四六六·九九六、則英美之負担、多於華商僅十七萬零等語、該原呈人等、並根據上述之解釋、分别作成三級税及二級税時代、英美烟公司與其他烟公司銷用捲烟統税印花比較表、及其納税數目比較表、本署詳閲原有公報及印花税欵賬簿、查見原呈採用統計、對於印花表致誤之點有四、（一）未考察當時發售印花實况、自捲烟統税開辦起、至二十一年二月止、前捲烟統税處或前統税署印花、曾分兩處發售、一在庫劵基金委員會、一在前捲烟税處、或前統税署、原統税公報所登、英美烟公司銷用印花分等表、卽該公司向基金委員會購領之印花數目、其他烟公司銷用印花分等表、係指前統税署出售之印花數目、又公報所登納税數目表内之英美（甲欄、爲向前統税署購花之價値、英美（乙）欄、爲向基金委員會購花之價値、當時均經按月、在納税表附註欄　、加以註明、此項納税表内所列英美（乙）欄之税欵、核與英美銷用印花分等表價値欄之總數必相等、是兩表原可互證、（例如二十年一月份統税公報納税數目表内、英美（乙）欄計一·七一六·九○一元二五○爲英美向基金委員會購花數目、與原登英美銷用印花分等表價値欄之總數一·七一六·九○一元二五○相等、）故原呈人所編印表内、其他公司一欄所列數目、實仍含有英美一部份購花、計一級八九三四張、（内有舊三級花一張）二級三七·三三九七張、三級三○六·○○六張、（内有舊三級花一·六五二張、）共爲新舊印花三四四·二三九·一張、折合税欵、計一千五百二十一萬九千五百九十二元七角在内、原呈採用統計、事前並未查詢明白、遽施片面論斷、以致引用錯誤、（附英美二十年一月至二十一年二月、在署購花數目表、）（二）二十年二月及二十一年三月、因改訂税率、均有舊税印花退回、應予照數减除、原呈計算時、並未注意、（三）二十一年三月爲新舊税交替時期、本應分别將新舊印花數目列出方合實在情形、原呈竟省去三月不算、自有未合、（四）印花應按税等計算面價、方能與實收税欵相符、原呈不辨等級、亦未經以税率折合税額、與税欵表相互對核、安得不發生誤會、（例如原送印花表内六月份英美爲二四·五六○張、而税欵表内則爲二○四八·六二九元、惟按諸實際、其張數應分一級六○張、二級二·五○○張、三級二二·○○○張、折合税欵、計一·○七八·八○○九、）又原呈對於税欵表致誤之點有四、（一）上述改税時商人退還舊税印花、其所値面價原呈在税欵表内、已予扣算、惟印花表内、並未照數减除、是印花與税額作爲對照核算之效用已失、統計自難得其眞相（二）前統税公報所例税欵、包含雪茄烟税在内、原呈槪未淸算明白、（三）自二十年十一月舶來捲烟改徵金單位關税全額、所有統税卽經免除、但仍由海關按月</p>
<p>將所收關税劃撥五分之四到署、是原列税欵中、尙有此項舶來品撥税在内、應予劃出不計、方能表現國製捲烟納税之眞象、原呈復未審查及此、（四）三級税時代、舶來品進口存棧、至二級税施行</p>
<p>時、始補税出廠、以及其他補税問題發生所收之零星補税、均經歸入税欵總數内登記、此項補税、不在當時發售之一級印花數目内、亦應提出不計、乃原呈一律認爲國製紙烟税欵、殊嫌混同、茲特依據上列各點、將原送印花比較表、及税欵比較表、分别更正另編、加以説明、俾明眞相、附列本署改正三級税及二級時捲烟印花分等明細表、及捲烟税收試算表、又查三級税經過時期爲十五個月、爲便利統計比較起見、對於二級税、亦採取十五個月之數、（未完）</p>

<p>答羅志，沈楓，楊立會諸君</p>
<p>『我缺乏研究文學的天才，』一我的個性不近於研究哲學啊！』我們在許多讀者的來信中，談話裏常常看見，聽到這類的　句。他們張着失望的眼睛在羨慕現代許多有『天才』的作家，『個性』近於某一學問的研究者，自己郤已失了自信，無勇往　進的雄心去研究文學、探　哲理。他們以爲『天才』『個性』都是由於天生的，這與一個人生得有一雙『旣　且貴』的父母一樣，完全不能由你作主。他們對於這些智識，仍是萬分欣　，猶如行丐的人看見了『山珍海味』仍會口纔一樣，但是祇是　嘆，不能　前進一步，去取得他們。</p>
<p>這是一種非常錯誤的觀念，它有阻碍學習的進程、消蝕靑年的熱力的作用、它將使人自甘自棄、認自　是個低能兒，祗有安於貧愚，永遠低首俯伏於那些統治他們的智識的『天才』</p>
<p>之前，一動也不敢一動。</p>
<h3 id="c200">我們要首先除去種錯學！ <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>自然進成這種錯覺不是一回簡單的事，它有它的社會基礎，及其他複雜的因素的。我們爲了使廣大的讀者能了解以下的解説起見，特爲將近來許多來信中，談话中很活躍的提出來的質問，組成下面對話，以助讀者展讀本篇通信的興趣。</p>
<p>－先生！『天才』到底有沒有，應該怎樣解釋呢？</p>
<p>－依我的意見，所謂『天才』决不能解作是天生的，它仍是由於社會生活的環境所决定的。你知道，愛迪生是一個大科學家，大槪總可算個『天才』罷。他只能出生於二十世紀的今日，郤不能早生於中世紀。他只能生於資本主羣高度發展的美國、郤不能出生於『印度』『中國』？</p>
<p>－－這是怎樣説的？</p>
<p>－－這就是因爲愛迪生的發明不是由他老先生的身上長有與别人身上不同的細胞，他的發明是建築在美國科學發達的條件上。要有了前人的自然科學智識的遺產，科學機械的設備，社會的需要，纔能育成他的才能的發展的條件。在中世紀自然科學智識還不够得很，缺乏了他的發明的前提，若就印度，中國説，這種殖民地的環境下、也是不許可有這類人才出生的。所以印度只能生出『太戈　』，中國目前能出生的是『某神童』之類的人物，能够發明的只是『科學　乩圖』。你不要笑，如果美國的愛先生不幸生在中國，他也許變爲愛神童了，這一點也不奇怪啊！</p>
<p>－－先生不覺得白種人的智能高我們麽？－－目前白種人一般的文化水凖高過我們，自然不能否認，但這不是説他們的人種生來比别人高，是他們社會生活條件比我們好！講到人種的智能，是無分别的。現在白種人裏的資本家及其拳養的學者、都在製造白人優於雜色人種的瞎説，這無非想用人種優越去統治殖民地的奴隸，使這些奴才們不要反抗，甘心去媚事主人啊！愛迪生的發明，我們不能從人種質的優越去解釋，只能從社會條件去解釋啊！－－先生，拿美國與中國比，以上的解釋我是贊同的，但是，在同一環境内，譬如同在美國，或中國的環境内，爲什麽各個人而有種</p>
<p>種的差異呢？我總覺得『天才』是有的，並且一半也是由於天生的。</p>
<p>－－各個人的差異的原因，複雜得很，世間上就沒有二張樹葉是完全一致的。但就一般極明確的差異説也是由社會條件造成的。不同的生活，造出不同的身體，不同的智力，不同的思想。有錢的人吃得很肥胖，饑餓的人不免是枯瘦，有錢的人能够從幼稚園讀到出洋留學，無錢的人一生是文盲，有錢的人總想世界昇平，億萬斯年，無錢的人只恐天下不變，這一切都不是偶然的。所謂『天才』，都是由於後天環境的養成，並不是天生的優種。一個文盲要想成爲愛迪生固然不可能，卽要成一位泰戈爾也只是幻想。因爲他缺乏表達他的能力的條件。譬如就何君説，因爲高小尙未畢業，所以對於文學的欣賞還不能像大學生一樣的方便，這是因爲缺乏素養，不是自已的『天才』不及别人。當今中國的文學家，有許多是因爲有比何君更好的素養，有的是從艱苦中鍜鍊出來的，他們因爲不相信『王侯將相』有一定的種子，他們</p>
<p>不相信『天才』，他們要去苦鬥，結果也竟成了功。但是，中國從文盲出身的作家到底到現在還沒有，因爲文盲要成爲作家，還要通過識字的階段，如果中國文字能够馬上將它簡單化，將文盲肅淸，那時今日被認爲低下的人羣中不知要生出幾多『天才』作家來呀！所以造成目前個人的差異的是社會制度，社會環境束縛你的發展了，它得許多同質的人，造成許多不同的種顃，就猶如同一種子播於沙漠之野與肥美的土壤生出不同的結果一樣，這與種子的本身並無多大關係。所以，我説『天才』並不是天生的。</p>
<p>－－我還有點懷疑，爲什麽同一父母，同一小的生活環境而出生的人也有逈然不同的差</p>
<p>異呢？</p>
<p>－－不錯！這種差異也是有的。並且差異總是永遠會有，這就是説宇宙間沒有兩件完全相同的事物。但現社會下同一父母生的子女賦有不同的愚智，一大半也還是由於各人出生後的時間中受到較優或較壞的社會生活的影響。如果將這種原因不管，所存留的差異，並不是壞的事。因爲這些差異並不會束縛他們的發展</p>
<p>，不過，决定他們向不同的方向發展罷了。這正是充實宇宙的豐富，不是人爲的戕賊人的智能。總之，在將來社會内，愚智這兩個字漸漸要被消滅了。『天才』也只能留作恭維，慶賀一個成功者的祝辭，不是限於一部份人的身份，更不能解作是『天生』的了。將來如果還有這個名詞、那是人人可以獲取的勝利的標幟。－－照先生的解説，像我們這樣缺乏發展條件的人，不是一輩了無發展的希望嗎？</p>
<p>－－完全不是這樣？我們缺乏發展條件，我們更應創造利於我們大衆的發展條件。譬如就你（指何君）説，你旣然在高小畢業，又想研究文學，發展的道路上固然很是艱辛，但不是説你就不能開一條路走。在這裏成爲問題的還不是客觀上的困難，倒是你觀念上的錯誤。如果你相信『王侯將相』必定出自『王侯之門』</p>
<p>你自已却是平庸的種子，缺乏某種『天才』，你</p>
<p>自然沒有征服環境的决心，你自然不免在這觀念中消蝕去你的生活的活力了。如果你在觀念上有了改造，你不妨利用你現在生活範圍内許可的條件，一步一步去推進，你要成文學家，一方面實際的體騐生活，一方面培養文字的乎段，你在文學上自然也可望開出一條道路。卽就一個文盲説，祗要他不安於『命運』，他自然會起來，第一步改善自己最低限度的生活，生活改進了，他會要求擴大自已的認識，要求識字，讀書了，他還會要求别人能做自己也能從事的任何一部門的社會工作了。所以，我們覺得你並不是一輩子無希望，而要看你努力不努力！</p>
<p>－－我現在全懂了。智能的高低全然另有社會的原因，及自己努力征服環境的程度而定。所謂『天才』他並不是一般人做不到的，只是别人或者沒有機會，或者不肯奮鬥，先生，你看對不對？</p>
<p>對的！還有疑問麽？</p>
<p>－－沒有了。我本來還有一個問題，卽個性的差異，現在聽了先生對於一天才的解釋這一個問題，也就連帶解决了。『個性』自然也是環境育成的，是不是？</p>
<p>－－是！</p>
<p>－－那末，個性也是應該可以改變的了。我常常聽見許多朋友説，他的一個性近於文學大半是不懂數學的。我現在覺得個性旣然可由環境而改變，研究文學的人，不也可以變成高興研究數學者麽？</p>
<p>－－自然可以！現在許多靑年人對於個性有一種誤解，他們並不了解什麽是個性，他們以爲什麽東西容易研究，就認爲與自己個性接近，否則卽不接近。所以你的朋友以爲文學和社會科學是容易研究的束西，可以少費氣力。數學要演題，要按步就班，所以較難。其實，好多人都是把學問看得太便宜的東西，一遇到困難，就以爲與個性不近，因之中途將研究的東西棄置了。其實，文學，社會科學都不比數學容易，都非用過苦功不可。個性固然是由環境育成，却不能憑一點淺薄的知識的嘗試，就可斷定自己的個性不近。研究學問貴在適於自己研究的條件是對的，沒有學習化學的條件，一定强之在追求它却也不必，但如果因難而卽斷定爲不適自己的個性則是不錯。個性因爲是由環境决的，自然可改造它。譬如，目前中國大衆有了解民族危機的必要，了解國際政治的必要，却不能因爲什麽個性不近，去忽視國民</p>
<p>應有的認識，我們應如何改造它、使它與自己發生興趣，改變以前造成這忽視政治的原因，迥避實踐的『個性』。至於自己的生活條件適宜於往某一學問進展的人，除不應忽略了共同的認識外，其他專業却可由他自由發展，不必相强，也無相强他轉入某一特種學問的理由。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>鸞輿的内部全是用杏黃色的貢緞幔起來的那些貢緞的顏色，都是特别的鮮艷，而且是時常在更換着的。待到太后快要使用到它的時候，李蓮英便親自走過去，用心察看一番，倘有什麽汚漬，或缺少了什麽東西的話，便立卽調補好。及至太后走進鸞輿的時候，旁邊還得臨時加上一道布幔，團團地圍着，使一切的人，都不能偷看伊；連被派着槓抬這乘鸞輿的那些太監，也絶對看不見伊。一直等到伊在鸞輿裏坐穩之後，那一道布幔才撤去；同時那些轎夫，便小心翼翼地擔負起這副千金重擔來。如果萬一不幸而因爲其中有一個轎夫走錯了一步路，以致於使坐在鸞輿裏的太后一跤翻下輿來，或雖不曾翻下，而己受了一些驚嚇，那就鬧大了！至多在半天工夫以内，這十六名轎夫的腦袋便得一齊吊下來了！不過據我所知道，這樣的事情，事實上是從沒有發生過的：因爲給太后抬這乘鸞輿的十六名轎夫，可説是打全中國幾萬幾千史轎夫裏頭所挑出來的</p>
<p>顶兒，尖兒，無論如何，决不會走错一步的。就是他們自己，也往往自負得了不得；而且以爲能給太后當差，眞旬是一椿最光榮的事情。他們所穿的服裝，又是十二分美麗的；頭上是戴着普通的圍帽，却沒有頂子或翖領一類的裝飾物！上身穿的淡紅色的背心；下面穿的是湖綠色的長褲；脚上是深黑色的靴子，但並不是長統。</p>
<p>他們不論在起步的時候，或行走的時候，都是十二分的小心；當然，他們也知道殺頭不是一件有趣味的事情！三八）</p>

<p>古時有句話：『怒是猛虎，慾是深淵。發怒誠然是很傷身體的，據心</p>
<p>理學家的研究，人在發怒的時候，一切作用都會停止，假使在吃飯時發脾氣，竟會使你吃不下飯。所以拿破倫也有一句話説：人不能爲自制之習慣，其身體亦不能康健。我們要遏止忿怒，唯有在『忍耐』兩字下做工夫，如果忍耐工夫做得到家，怒氣自然會遏制下去的。西哲稽羅説：『我們勝忿怒，要如勝勁敵』。吉福生亦説：『怒時數一到十，而後出言。大怒時數一至百』。他們這一種説法，無非要呌粗暴的人，多做些忍耐工夫。古書上有一叚記述，很値得介紹一下：富弼少時，人有駡之者，佯爲不聞；人曰：駡汝。弼曰：恐駡他人。又曰：呼君名。弼曰：恐同姓名者。其人大慚。</p>
<p>我們血氣方剛的靑年人，最容易動怒發氣，我們不妨學學富弼，但是我們要記着：『氣血之怒不可有，義理之怒不可無。</p>

<p>朋友Ｗ君以電話約我到他那兒－賈西義路去一趟，因爲時間迫促得很，便在黃家闕路喊了部人力車搭上去·有彈性的膠皮車輪，在滑溜溜的柏油路－大林路上滾動着，沒有聲，尤其不會擺動，兩眼向着沿途的住宅，籬笆，老虎灶，烟紙店，記憶不清的行人慢慢地巡視，覺得有無限的逸致，比坐在什麽汽車裏的人們要舒服！</p>

<p>看了一遍。看完了後，他不由冷笑着，自言自語的道：這不是夢話嗎？手上拿了那封信靜靜的沉思了一遍，想着，這件事不應當瞞着母親，直接告訴了他，有什麽風潮發生了，也可以母子們商量着來對付，多一個年老人指揮着，總多一番見識。於是毫不猶豫的，拿了那封信衝到江氏屋子裏去，將信一舉，沉着臉道：媽！你瞧，這不是笑話嗎。甘二爺好好的寫一封信給我，囉哩囉唆，説上一大堆。江氏立刻也就紅了臉，喘着氣道；你瞧什麽？你嚷什麽？説着，他就站起身來，搶着先關上了門。這才低聲道：這可胡鬧了，他寫信給你，信上説了些什麽？你念給我聽聽。桂枝紅着臉，先不念信，便綳着臉道；這眞是一件笑話。（三八八）</p>

<p>— 陳師誠</p>
<p>嚴州據之江上游，距胥口三十里，東下武陵，西趨歙縣，南達蘭溪，有交通要道，自杭江鐵路成，而形勢爲之一變矣。余與胡子伯翔等遊七里瀧竟，舟達嚴城時，已鏱鳴八下，聞汽艇至嚴東關而止，關距城的約三里，須步行往，今雨久水漲，故得直達嚴城焉。舍舟而陸，相偕至王萬春進晚餐。</p>
<p>嚴城形勢險要，土地肥沃，天富之國也。年來穀賤傷農，所入僅足納賦税，以致百業凋零，民窮財盡，我華以農立國，江浙又以富庶稱，而農村破產若是，匪患之多，良有以也。三十一日晨七時半發。出東門右折行，八時一刻至七郎廟。廟臨江而築，氣勢雄偉，門有額曰『古建昌殿一。殿供安樂王七郎神位，廟右有漸江亭，亭樓，可以登覽。南望錢江，波</p>
<p>平如鏡，近山朝拱，遠樹含烟，爲心曠神怡者久之。</p>
<p>八時五分離廟行，渡江趨南高峰。峰頂有巽塔，以地居嚴城巽位故名。十時五分至天寗寺，寺居塔畔，殊簡陋，乃相偕登塔，塔係磚建，僅五層可登，層十六級至二十級不等。北望嚴城，如居釜底。按諸形家言，亦福地也。下，趨寺索茗解渴，寺僧以醃菜及鹹蘿蔔進，味殊可口，頃刻　盡數器。詢其製法，則於冬令醃菜時置蘿蔔缸底而已。住持名功圓，和藹可親，而面有菜色。十一時行，雇小舟渡。舟狹長如梭，無艙，同行者凡八人，幾不能容。十一時四十分抵嚴東關，登陸就味我家餐。畢，羣　登北高峰。</p>
<p>峯在嚴東關外，地居嚴城卯位，故峯頂之搭，卽以卯名。與南高峯隔江對峙。二時十分行，出嚴東關，峯已聳立目前矣，山勢陡削，道狹如羊腸，曲折迥環，作之字形。鼓勇而登，未及册腰，已氣喘不能止。二時三十五分至　通古寺，寺背山面江，勢殊壯麗，殿有嶺西劉宗標聯曰『拔地孤峯，啓科第三元之瑞。』『驚天一柱，鎖江流萬頃之波』。聯語似有所指，惜寺僧不解文義、雖詢之而茫然無以對也。住持名普昌，　居士而守廟者也，策杖爲導，往遊卯塔，塔亦磚建，雄峙峯頂，高出寺上約十餘丈，七級均可登。二時十分至塔頂，俯瞰錢江，蜿蜓如帶，　溪迤邐南來，會於峯前。北望烏龍，雄奇挺秀，羣山環繞，如虎踞龍蟠，烟樹迷離，呈羣黛色，帆牆隱約，時去時來，一幅天然圖盡也。</p>
<p>折而下，循故道行。路狹而曲，土多沙質，滑不留足。三時三十五分至神仙井，井在寺東，有二口，並列如人目然。水微呈白色。普昌云，北井源　溪，南井源徵州，雖並列山　，而淸濁各異。視之果然。山居艱於行汲，得此良便。造物之奇，　此益信。</p>
<p>四時十分行，折回嚴城，五時一刻進興仁門。東湖已在望矣。　有六　醫院及嚴子　祠。屋多彷西式建築。　右卽西湖，地位較東湖狹小。瀏覽片時，與盡而返。</p>

<p>自來言傷寒者。皆宗仲景傷賽論。而言傷寒論者。皆不能脱離六經。以余觀之。傷寒論之最無意義者。六經也。最謊謬者。六經之説也。六經者何。太陽。沙陽。陽明。太陰。少陰。厥陰也。其名始見於内經十二經脈十二經筋。其命名之義。又皆從巫祝之言而生。素問至眞要大論曰。『帝曰。陽明。何謂』</p>
<p>也。歧伯曰。兩陽合明也。帝曰。厥陰。何謂也。歧伯曰。兩陰交盡也』。其義則靈樞陰陽繫日月篇詳之矣。其言曰。『寅者。正月之生陽也。主左足之少陽。未者。六月。主右足之少陽。卯者。二月。主左足之太陽。午者。五月。主右足之太陽。辰者。三月。主左足之陽明。巳者。四月。主右足之陽明。此兩陽合於前。故曰陽明。申者。七月之生陰也。主右足之少陰。丑者十二月。主左足之少陰。酉者八月。主右足之太陰。子者十一月。主左足之太陰。戍者九月。主右足之厥陰。亥者十月。主左足之厥陰。此兩陰交盡。故曰厥陰。』馬玄臺注曰。以正二五六月爲少陽太陽。而三四朋居於其中。則彼二陽合明於其前。故曰陽明也。以七月八月爲陰之初生。而十一十二爲陽之初生。惟九十月則爲陰之盡。故曰厥陰也』。則其所謂太少等者。以正月爲少陽。二月爲太陽。三月爲陽明。六月爲少陽。五月爲太陽。四月爲陽明。七月爲少陰。八月爲太陰。九月爲厥陰。十二月爲少陰。十一月爲太陰。十月爲厥陰也。然考之易緯。以冬至爲十一月中。應足太陰。與靈樞十一月太陰合。以小寒爲十二月節。應手太陰。與靈樞十二月少陰不合。以大寒爲十二月中。應足少陰。與靈樞十二月少陰合。以立春爲正月節。應足少陽。與靈樞正月少陽合。以雨水爲正月節。應手少陽。與靈樞正月少陽合。然鄭注以爲於脈宜爲手太陽。則與靈樞不合矣。以驚蟄爲二月節。應足太陽。與靈樞二月及陽合。以春分爲二月中。應手太陽。與靈樞二月太陽合。以淸明爲三月節。應足陽明。與靈樞三月陽明合。以榖雨爲三月中。應足陽明。與靈樞三月陽明合。以立夏爲四月節。應手陽明。與靈樞四月陽明合。以小滿爲四月中。應足太陽。與靈樞四月陽明不合。以芒種爲五月節。應足太陽。與靈樞五月太陽合。以夏至爲五月中云。應手陽脈。據靈樞例宜作太陽。然易緯所分配。不盡與靈樞合。則其所謂陽脈者，不知指何陽也。以小暑爲六月節。應足陽明。與靈樞六月少陽不合。以大暑爲六月中。應手少陽。與靈樞六月少陽合。以立秋爲七月節。應足少陽與靈樞七月少陰不合。以處暑爲七月中。應手太陰。與靈樞七月少陰不合。以白露爲八月節。應足太陰與靈樞八月太陰合。以秋分爲八月中。應手少陽。與靈樞八月太陰不合。以寒露爲九月節。應足蹶陰。與靈樞九月厥陰合。以霜降爲九月中。應足蹶陰。與靈樞九月厥陰合。以立冬爲十月節。應手少陽。與靈樞十月厥陰不合。以小雪爲十月中。應心主脈。心主者。手厥陰也。與靈樞十月厥陰合。以大雪爲十一月節。應手心主。與靈樞十一月太陰不合　此以月値爲言。其理旣不根。其數又各異。可以知其不可據矣。</p>

<p>在這種情形之下，魚肝油，石灰質，維太命，及太陽光的照射，可應用於相當的時間，以便使嬰兒的骨頭有相當的發展。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>在各種官覺方面，嬰兒的感　覺發達最早、對於那些經過他們嘴裏的食物的情狀，最先明瞭。所以母親們要當心那些嬰兒容易到手的東西而且不要把尖利的物件給小孩玩弄。</p>
<p>嬰兒的聽覺並沒有完全發達、過了兩個月，我們有時看見嬰兒的頭會蹆着聲嚮的方向而旋轉的。</p>
<p>一個嬰孩假使是健康的，在二個月後，就開始的會笑了。在六個月至八個月之間，我們可以聽到小兒的喃喃學語的聲調，九個月至十個月，就能够喚着『爸爸！媽媽！』這些正是大人所盼望的説話了。一待過了週歲，就能認淸字句。</p>
<p>到了二週歲，嬰兒對於説話的能力，己有相當的發展了，在這個當兒，做父母的同他們再不要説那些咿唔的『孩語一，要説正式的説話，使小兒們那些不通的『孩語』容易忘却。</p>

<p>這個時候，在嬰兒的食料中，就該預備着石灰質。</p>
<p>嬰兒每天應當要有相當的運動。因爲合法的運動不但可以使呼吸靈便，消化力增加，而且可以帮助發育，矯正身體的姿勢，得到良好的動作。</p>
<p>嬰兒在四個月後，就可開始舉行戶内體操，做母親的要想法子使他的孩子對於體操感到興趣，在舉行體操的時候，唱些歌曲等或其他的動作。</p>
<p>體操的時間，起初有五分鐘就够了，以後逐漸增加到十五分鐘爲止。</p>
<p>在將要用餐或者餐後不久的當兒，體操一定不可舉行，否則就要把消化力耗去了。</p>
<p>體操的時候，嬰兒一定要醒着而且不要過餓。總之，最緊要的是要有規定的時間，運動完畢，要立刻把衣服替他穿好，不致着冷。</p>
<p>體操沒有開始舉行的時候，頂好是去請敎醫生，得到他的指導。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>最後，我要使母親們對於那些小寳貝發生意外危險的時候，知道一些應会的立法。</p>
<p>如果做母親的發覺到她的孩子是很不舒服的時候，先把他安放在床上，然後測量他的體溫。</p>
<p>假使體溫是很高的，可以用一條在熱水裏浸過了的布（或毛巾）包裏着上身，這樣是會發生効力的。</p>
<p>有時嬰兒的咽喉也該注意到的，因爲有許多的病，往往從那裏發生出來。皮膚割開或其他的微傷、用碘酒塗上，再把綳布裏着。燙傷的時候，用石灰水或棉子油包札。</p>
<p>抽筋或痙攣的病，先使小兒躺着，再用冷布裏着頭部及心口。</p>
<p>遇到外來物件給小兒吞到肚裏去，</p>
<p>或是弄到耳朶裏，或鼻子裏去的時候，就要立刻去請醫生。</p>
<p>我希望上面所説的意見與方法，至少給年靑及未來的平親們有一些用處和帮助的。（完）</p>

<p>（二十九）疫痢</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做疫痢？</p>
<p>（答）是夏秋間專侵三歲到六歲小兒的一</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>種危險的泄瀉病。</p>
<p>（問）他的病原是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）病原未明，大槪似乎像痢疾細菌或大腸菌之類。</p>
<p>（問）小兒怎樣容易起疫痢呢？</p>
<p>（答）他的誘因是亂食不易消化的水果，糖果，多飲冷飲，夜間睡眠中受寒等。（問）這種病爲什麽是危險的呢？</p>
<p>（答）因爲疫痢能使病兒呈劇烈的中毒症狀之故。</p>
<p>（問）染病之後，發病之前，有沒有潛伏期？</p>
<p>（答）有數小時到二十四小時的潛伏期。（問）發病的開始時是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）病兒忽然脱力，不活潑而靜臥。</p>
<p>（問）發病時病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）體溫上昇（發熱）到攝氏表三十八度至三十九度：同時排出二三回的惡臭軟便或泄瀉。糞便中混有不消化物和粘液。不久，體溫更上昇到四十度至四十一度。大便的性狀是粘液血便，並無裏急後重，一天可十數回。此外也有在發病時起嘔吐，吐出褐色或珈啡渣樣物質。大便中也混有黑色的東西。這都是消化</p>
<p>器中出血而變成黑色的。</p>
<p>（問）腹部有什麽現象？</p>
<p>（答）病兒的腹部，稍陷沒，柔軟，往往有腹鳴和壓痛。</p>
<p>（問）此外還有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）此外有昏睡，痙攣，脈搏頻數微弱，皮膚蒼白，四肢冷却，面色靑白等而死。</p>
<p>（問）最兇險的有多少時間經過？</p>
<p>（答）經過最劇烈的，經過十二小時到二十四小時因心臟麻痺而死。</p>
<p>（問）輕的經過怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）輕的在一二天内，體溫下降，各種病狀漸漸消散而治瘉。</p>
<p>（問）還有更輕症的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）也有單是數冋泄瀉，輕度發熱或排泄數回的粘液便就止。這樣的病狀，好像普通的胃腸卡他兒。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣診斷呢？</p>
<p>（答）凡小兒悉突然脱力，倦怠，橫臥的時候，就應該置疑於本病。至若有高熱嘔吐，中毒症狀，粘液便而無裏急後重的時候，那一定可以診斷是本病了。（問）豫後的危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）年齡愈小愈危險，肥胖的小兒反比瘦削的爲不良。死亡率有百分之二三十。</p>
<p>（問）疫痢的治療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）和病疾相同。尤其要注意他的心臟，常用强心藥。若有中毒症狀的時候，須注射生理食鹽水等。</p>
<p>（問）預防方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）和痢疾同，就是把病人的糞便消毒，禁食不熟和不消化的不潔食物。注意飲料的潔等。</p>
<h3 id="c283">麻瘋病之醫治問題 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 高明强</p>
<p>國際麻瘋會議，曾於一九三一年一月九日，在斐列賓馬尼刺舉行，到會參加者，多爲各國從事麻瘋工作富有經騐之醫師，共有二十餘人。會議日期，計二星期之久，誠爲醫學界空前之盛舉也。所有議决案件，皆揭載於斐列賓科學雜誌。旋由紐約伍德紀念剷除麻瘋基金會印千單本，分發全球各大醫學團體。本文卽譯自該會議决報告書中關於醫治之一節　幸讀者勿以等閒視之。—譯者</p>
<p>治療麻瘋，必須用普通療法與特種療法二者並進，方易見效。而此等療法，尤須隨各個病人而異，不能一槪施行也。</p>
<p>（一）普通療法麻瘋病之普通療法、與施用於其他長期之傳染病者，大致相仿。但多數對於此症有經騐之醫師，以爲有損抵抗力之疾病，麻瘋病人必須竭力避免，實爲醫治見效之重要關鍵。又如食物質量之支配得宜，亦頗關重要。其他如個人之衛生，適當之運動，精神之娛快，輕易之工作等，均於醫治上有相當之價値，不可不注意也。</p>
<p>（二）特種療法凡關於治療之手續及消滅病區之企圖，均可稱之爲特種療法，諸如藥劑與手術之施用等皆是。</p>
<p>藥劑之應用最廣者，莫如大楓子油及此油之各種製劑。油之最常用者，名ＨｙｄｎｏｏａｒｂｕｓＷｉｇｈｔｉａｎａ。及Ｈ·ａｎｔｈｅｌｍｉｎｔｉｏａ（此二種皆屬大楓子類，並爲此類中之最佳者。）此等油之製劑中，最能引起治療上之注意者，則爲脂酸之二烷　與鈉鹽。以臨診上之結果觀之，此等油類及其各種製劑，於醫治上之價値，幾爲相同。故應用時之選擇，大都着重於獲得之簡易，轉運之利便，質地之純潔與保藏之永久等。</p>
<p>二烷　在各大醫治中心，應用頗廣，且爲各處從事醫治麻瘋者所樂用。推其原因，由於製造此藥之步驟，能使其每次之出品，爲固定均匀而有一定之凖則。又如注射時之不起局部反應，亦較他種製劑爲優。且此種反應，可以加千分之五之碘，而减輕之。有些醫師，則喜用純油及脂酸鈉鹽。此等藥劑，雖可用以肌肉注射或皮下注射，但施行表皮注射之效果，則不如二烷　之佳，故尙少試用也。</p>
<p>注射之方法有肌肉，皮下，表皮及靜脈等。選擇之法，當視藥劑之性質而定。例如純油不宜於表皮注射，而以用二烷爲佳；而純油與二烷　，均不宜於靜脈注射等，皆不可不加以注意。而皮膚上之病區，往往可由表皮注射法，而易於消散。至於各種藥劑用量之多少，並無一定之凖繩，必須視病人之耐受性而爲斷也。</p>
<p>其他油劑之如Ｈｙｄｎｏｃａｒｐｕｓ類應用者，亦有數種。惟所得經騐，尙不足以評定其價値也。</p>
<p>爲使病人易於恢復計，常採用控制發熱性反應（Ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌｌａｂｌｅｆｅｂｒｉｌｅｒｅａｃｔｉ）</p>
<p>ｏｎ）。諸如紫外光綫，放射熱，熱浴，等物理療法，皆於麻瘋病人極有裨益也。</p>
<p>其他藥劑如金製劑及他種重金類製劑等，亦經試用，但必須十分愼重。氱化碘（ｉｏｄｉｄｅｓ）於多數病人，不甚相宜。依經騐而論，此種藥劑，祇能用於體格壯健，而於大楓子類製劑有大量耐受性之病人。</p>
<p>醫治之標凖與鑑定現時欲得一標凖之醫治方法、尙非其時。最能使人滿意之方法，則爲Ｈｙｄｎｏｃａｒｐｕｓ油類之表皮注射。同時可與肌肉注射法並用。麻瘋爲慢性之疾病，故醫治所用之方法與藥劑之有效與否？必須施用後一年或數年·方可决定。且現時尙無正確之方法，可以評定醫治之價値也。臨床及顯微鏡下之檢騐，每多錯誤，非手術精巧，訓練有素，細心查騐者，不能勝任也。</p>

<p>— 沈恭</p>
<p>（三）鉍劑。鉍之應用於治療梅毒。始自近年。然大多不單用而爲合併療法之輔佐藥。較諸砒，鉍，及水銀之功效。諸家報告。殊不一致。</p>
<p>砒九：鉍七：水銀五（Ｆｒｉｅｂｏｅｓ）</p>
<p>砒：十鉍七：水銀四（Ｍｉｌｉａｎ）</p>
<p>砒十：鉍六：水銀四（Ｇｏｕｇｅｒｏｔ）</p>
<p>但勃洛克氏Ｂｒｏｃｑ則謂鉍之功效。並不較偉於水銀云。</p>
<p>（四）碘劑。碘劑於第一期梅毒。效力薄弱。然至後期。則其效頗大。碘劑一入體内。逮分解後始起作用。用法亦有注射及内服兩種。惟副作用亦所難免。</p>
<p>藥固可療病。然亦可殺人。故處理適當與否。爲醫家學技之分岐點。梅毒之能否全愈問題。現猶諸説紛紜。莫衷一是。要之，在病家能早期受適當之治療。則其成績速而確。所以感傳梅毒後。就醫問題。頗有出入。蓋應用藥品。貴有層次也。譬如梅毒之第一期。主在注射砒劑，而兼行鉍劑，或水銀療法。在第二期，則宜先用水銀或鉍劑。二三星期後。再注射砒劑。至第三期，則碘劑可以去發疹。但欲完全治療。亦非賴砒劑，鉍劑，及水銀不可。在患内臟，或神經梅毒病人。則先生碘鉍及水銀之治療。然後再徐行砒劑之注射。是故患者往往以爲注射十次，已得治愈。而事實上每有欲速則不達之憾。蓋療病貴在治本。若僅顧外表。轉致弄巧成拙。而釀成所謂潛伏性梅毒。潛伏性梅毒者。卽外表毫無梅毒徵候。而血液仍呈陽性反應者也。若患潛伏性梅毒者愈衆。則遺傳之機會亦愈多。而先天性梅毒病人。自亦隨增。對於治療，較爲周折。絶不似傳染後早期之直捷也。當此世界不景氣。而我國人尤貧。在衣食困頓之下。致不能受適當之治療者。不可枚舉。間亦有家計富裕。因惑於廣告。誤於庸醫者。亦比比皆是。此蓋僅知六○六，九一四之藥性。而不知藥性入體後所以發揮之情形故也。今時醫每利用世人心理。施其愚誘。以速愈爲餌。引致病人。而受其欺者。且卒不自悟。可勝嘆哉。於此吾不禁大聲疾呼曰，梅毒一宜注意預防。二須在早期行頓挫療法。三切需受長時間之合併療法。哀此滿目瘡痍。幸毋惑乎世之讕言也可。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第三章發生結核之誘因</p>
<p>結核菌旣然到了氣管枝或肺部裏面，那末，肺結核病從此就發作了嗎？這也是不一定的。尋常肺結核病的構成，是附帶有二個條件的。第一個是『外因』</p>
<p>，這就是結核菌怎樣侵襲人體，上面所講過的傳染途徑了。第二個是誘因，怎麽樣呌誘因呢？我們要曉得，每一個人的身體適應狀態，是各自爲别的：換名話説，抵抗力的程度，是人人不同的。照上面吸入傳染所説過的，結核菌在飛散半空塵埃的時候，是隨時隨地可以侵襲人體的：所以無論是那一個，在一天裏面，總有一二個結核菌侵入氣管裏面去的。這樣一來，不是個個都成了肺結核病人了嗎？但事實上决對不會如是的。普通身體健全的人，是具有抵抗力，來消滅侵襲的細菌的：卽使不幸細菌成功了，有時也不過發生微小的局部變化，並不是個個都蔓延成患，構成一般人所稱謂（臨床上所可證明）的本病的。但如果是身體衰弱，抵抗力薄弱的，先天後天有缺黠的，那末，當然是和前者不可同語，容易構成的了。這一種容易構成的狀態，就是本章所提出的『誘因』。　　肺結核的誘因是怎麽樣的呢？此中頂要緊的，當然是尋常所稱謂的癆瘵質了。具有此種體質資格的人們，大慨是：面狹長，長頸，窄胸，肋骨斜向下行，鎖骨上窩陷凹狠深，手足細長，肌肉和脂肪質是發育不良的。他的容貎軟弱，面色蒼白，齒牙整齊，吸氣肌薄弱，心臟和血管系都容易興奮的。像這樣體質，是狠容易發生結核的。他的原因，大半是先天的。</p>
<p>關於肺部的肺尖，也是最容易構成肺結核之傳染的。因爲肺尖的呼吸運動，是比較狠微弱的，他的換氣作用，比其他的肺部都少：假使結核菌和塵埃都達到肺尖，那裏排除是狠難的。此外，肺尖的血液供給，也比較其他的肺部少，這種情形，對於結核病的構成和進展，都是狠有利益的。肺結核的易構成與否，和年齡上也是不無關係的。尋常在十八歲以上。三十歲以下的，患此者比</p>
<p>較數目最多：小孩也不少。在四十歲以上的，可就比較的少了，卽使有，病勢的進展，大半也是慢性的。但在六十歲左右的老年人，明顯的例也是狠不少的。在性别上的統計，是男子多於女子的，這當然是接觸傳染的機會比較多的緣故了。</p>
<p>關於人們所處的環境，居住的地方，職業的塲所，過去的急性病，以及所患的慢性病等種種；和肺結核病的發生，都是狠有關係的。像居處卑濕，日光空氣都不流通，一天到晚，工作於密閉的工塲，和穢汚空氣的裏面：或因經濟地位的落後，致每日三餐不周全，食物的缺乏滋養品，更加是意中事。這幾種情形，都可以促進肺結核的構成的。對於病患方面，像糖尿病，傷寒，百日咳，麻疹，慢性氣管枝炎，氣枝支肺炎，等種種，都可以减弱人們身體的抵抗力的：對於肺結核的發生或進展，當然助力也是狠不小的。關於先天性肺動脈狹窄和　血肺二種狀態，也可以當作結核之誘因的。但他的原由究竟，我覺得太徧於學理方面了，不是一般沒有學過醫的人們所可領略的，所以此處也就節去不談了。（本章完待續）</p>

<p>尤有進者，『霍亂』與『虎列拉』三名，字雖不同，音實相近，虎列拉之本字旣爲Ｃｈｏｌｃｒａ，則Ｃｈｏｌｅｒａ之一字其爲霍亂之譯音，似無可疑。故言其疾病之源，則生於東亞，言其名詞之祖，則出於中華，今舍含有義意之定名，而從有音無意之日譯，轉相傳譯，而眞義全失，吾國人士又復變本加厲，簡稱虎疫，一若鼠疫之外，復有所謂大蟲疫者，事之可笑，寗過於此。新進之士，自有并霍亂之名而不知者、非所謂數典而忘祖耶？夫奴性不改，則獨立難期，醫學名詞，至微也，而拜外精神之表現，已無餘矣！糾而正之，亦關心世道人心者之責也。世之君子，以爲如何？</p>

<p>— 恒沙</p>
<p>世間不乏各種偉大的名理，説來動聽，作出文章來奇漂亮，發於行事，也　去有時很可觀，但我們知道那是要不得的。</p>
<p>卽以佛理而論吧，勸人爲善，作事慈悲，敎義難道本身不很健康嗎？將軍的圖書，不妨篆刻『佛門弟子』；社會上的蟊賊，也正可自號『居士』；刮地皮討姨太太之暇，略捐些錢修佛廟，刻佛經，於是成了老牌正人君子。如果聽野狐談禪理，倒覺其名理超超，忘其爲野狐。陸游有詩道：『組繡紛紛衒女工，詩人於此泣途窮』，此之謂也。</p>
<p>那道理，莊子早己有胠篋篇，無庸解釋了。并仁義而竊取之，成爲擁護自己的武器，有什麽方法可想呢？去問問官僚吧，請坐，别忙，他可以解釋的頭頭是道。東西洋的名理，隨手拈來，説一個天花亂墜；爭地盤呢，解除民衆的痛苦呀！搶飯碗呢，當仁不讓呀！事情弄糟了呢，中國沒有人才呀！甚而至於一敗塗地呢，那是以退爲進呀，也是易經中的道理！</p>
<p>於是，老百姓只好啞口無言，唯唯而退。</p>
<p>但有時一個闊人突然一下窮光了，或權貴突然倒坍，則眞面目於是畢露，啼笑俱非，這時仁義道德之類是不行的。縱令佛法，説畢竟皆空，也不行，無以爲慰，所以莊子于胠篋之餘</p>
<p>，也另著有盜跖篇，也許是後人假造的吧，但那思想大致是一貫的。</p>
<p>然而，邏輯亦有窮時，易理終於未濟，名理之名理己被佔盡，世界依然要改變的，爲的是老百姓往往無理可講而實是執着説不出之理。設若日本人一旦呑滅了中國呢，我們無疑的，名理又向那方面去了。</p>
<p>但這也仍然不足畏的，無理之理要打破有理之理，騙來騙去騙穿了，也就不足爲奇。滿人在淸朝統治漢人還不嚴密嗎，文治武功不都到了極致嗎，然而终于有民國，何也？</p>

<p>—爲故友陳行叔逝世三週紀念作—</p>
<p>（一）在一個微風習習的初夏的傍晚，太陽已掛上了樹梢，片片游雲在天空中卷舒蕩漾，我，懷挾著輕微感傷的情緒，獨自憑著樓窗愴神。腦海裏飄瞥著許多回過去離合悲歡的迹象以後，一時間想起了三年前在法國逝世的陳行叔－－屈指今日恰巧三整年了－－我心中頓然感到沉重的壓迫。他是一位絶對超越的典型靑年。他以一身包孕著人類各項的優點：他擅著絶世的聰明，他懷著深　的修養，他具有機警的才能與玲瓏的手腕，他能運用他特殊的理智來注視一切事物的變化，他能發揮他鋭敏的見地來應付一切疑難的來臨，他不倨傲，不板滯，不狡滑，不刻薄，始終保持著溫和的態度給予任何人以良好的印象。我們一領略到他優雅的風格，纒綿的情調，婉孌的談吐，便都會不自覺地傾倒於他。然而也正唯他太聰明了，太多思慮了，他能够透澈地了解别人，却不能了解自己；他能够以自己的靈感，給别人以安慰，却不能從别人身上得到自己的安慰。這樣，他就免不了走上憂　之路。同時他又偏重了學問的追求，忽視了身體的攝護，終於在博士論文未曾草竣以前，就患腸結核去世了。他的死耗頗震動一部份中外的學者。無疑地這是人才的惋惜，不僅是私誼的悼傷。關於他的整個學問思想，總該有人替他作傳，今且無庸細説。我所惓惓不能自己的，倒是一些情感上的片段的結想，有不能不借楮墨來抒寫一下的。我原是從他小時候就認識他的一個人。在我們幾個人中他是一向被視爲小弟弟的；可是他灼燁的光采，常被我們奉作漆室的明燈，他對於我們溫</p>
<p>煦的含量，又像是冷窖中添上一隻蒸氣的暖爐。現在是：凍氣未消，暖爐先撤，夜色猶濃，靈光忽昧。怎敎我們不摧懷傷心呢！</p>

<p>我同行叔第一次晤面，大約是在民國初年。那時我與他的四哥—叔諒—同在本地縣立高小裏念書。有一天，當退課的時候，我發見一個約摸七八歲年齡的孩子，在學生寢室外的走廊上徘徊著。他清秀的眉目，紅潤的臉龐，以及不時流露著的和婉的微笑，很引起許多同學高興的注意。後來知道他是叔諒的弟弟從鄉下特來探望他哥哥的，大家便都欣悦地同他去交談了。原想逗著他玩弄，出乎意外的是他的談吐非常斯文條理，不像一個七八歲孩子所能講得出的；而且問答之間，他的態度也大方得同大人一般，這自然使我們驚奇了—當時小學生的一般學齡，似乎比現在提得高一些，所以我們同學，大都己在十四五歲左右，很能懂得一些世故人情了。從那時起，他便給我留下一個不可磨滅的印象。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>他入中學時還只十四歲，優異的成績博得全校一致的贊譽。不但每試輒冠曹偶，而且還顯示了許多學課以外的貢獻。他有著特殊的抱負，却不常同人隨便談起的。他不像普通『優秀』學生一般爲考試而用功，他喜歡在課本外找知識以融會他一貫的企求。他不屑於試卷成績的高低，而只苦無法自凂。對於每次名列前茅，他固然沒有一些『沾沾』，反以爲别人根據榜上題名來恭維自己的是太瞧不起他了。爲了要避免他人注意的集中，他極力學習隨便，幹一些頑皮的行逕，甚至觸犯校章而被記過了，他只是微笑而己。他對於同學是這</p>
<p>樣的和易親善，幾於每個人都保持一些相當的友誼，他的言論又是這樣的委婉鬆快，幾於每一句話都能打動别人的心坎。他眞是一個玲瓏剔透的妙人兒，他眞是一個小精靈！</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>我與他開始接近，還在五四運動以後。那時我們辦了一個小小的刋物，他我之外，還有一位胡仲持，一位毛無止。編輯，校對，印刷，發行，差不多都要我們接洽料理，忙瘁是忙瘁極了，可是在彼此恊調之下，辦事是很有條理的，特别是行叔舒展他巧妙而熨貼的手腕，給我們以萬分熱烈的興趣，雖像我一向懶散的人，經他的鼓舞督促，也樂於從事了。刋物上的著作，在我們只不過隨便發表一些感想，他却常有新頴的思想，流利的筆調，可以發人深省的。還記得有一次他的隨感錄中這麽説：</p>
<p>『···偶然游行郊外，覺得這個天然的美，眞使人捨棄不得。必裏便想：假使我隔絶塵世，淸淸靜靜的享那天然的美的快樂，那眞是有樂趣有意味的人生啊！因此一想，覺得吾人之所以爲人，無非是因爲前面受了快樂的招誘，後面受了死亡悲慘的迫促，才去兼程猛進的做人，可見得人生確是被感情役使的了。</p>
<p>』······</p>
<p>『所以我的斷語是：感情的人生是積極的，理性的人生是消極的，感情的人</p>
<p>生是出世法，理性的人生是入世法；依生物學上講來，生活之本能，起於自保的要求，我們在目前這個境界，自然只好以消極的入世法爲滿足了。』</p>
<p>這樣一個出世法的仰慕者，是出於一個十五六歲的靑年，誰也會覺得驚異的罷。促持曾經慷慨地説：『這麽一個小弟弟，我們一班哥兒們眞是望塵莫及啊！』這句話，當時就被一致的公認了。</p>
<p>刋物的發行，比較上最感困難了。我們辦這刋物的動機，原爲喚起市民的愛國熱忱，當然希望有甚多的讀者；可是經費一無着落，印刷紙張是需錢的，普遍送閲勢難辦到，不得不從售賣入乎，爲了定戶的寥寥，我們只得冒著杲杲毒日，挾著我們心血澆裏乎自掬養的緖晶品，到街上去沿門『兜售』</p>
<p>了。這在我們自然不習慣，可也只得勉强從事。分途『兜售』</p>
<p>的結果，我們乎中的份數，常不及行叔銷得多，原因是他的一番委婉表示，容易博得市民的同情—我則往往連一份都不曾銷得。可是後來，他發覺多數市民賣了我們刋物以後，只隨便的一看就棄置了，他老大不高興起來，憤憤地對我們説：『我們費了偌大心血與精神，得不到一些代價，倒像是受了他們的布施，這還有什麽意義呢！』討論的結果，我們刋物終於就此停止了。</p>
<h3 id="c289">我們爲什麽將米抛在新郎新婦身上呢 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>鄭振鐸譯民俗學序論，中有一節解釋『我們爲什麽將米抛在新郎新婦身上？』『有的人將説，這是祝福，米乃是豐富多實的角徵。中國人則以米實行同一禮節，（主婦當新娘走進她的將來之家時，便將米抛在她的頭上。）米乃是豐富的象徵』我看，這個解釋有些錯誤，不問西里卜斯，印度古民族瓦特斯，英國某幾個地方的風俗是怎樣。</p>
<p>我國的習俗，當新娘走出轎門，抛在她的身上的，不僅是米，還有茶葉，碎紅紙之類。其意不在祝福，而在驅邪。處</p>
<p>女的貞操，在封建社會看得非常神秘，覺得時時有魔鬼乘機在擾亂；卽在這大典進行中，魔鬼還拚着大力作最後的搗亂。新郎頭上蓋着紅巾，轎門上掛着米節，米節上繫着萬年曆銅鏡裁衣尺等實物，布成八卦大陣，使魔鬼不得其門而入。新娘一出轎，趕把茶葉米撒了上去，使魔鬼遠遠避去，以完成圓滿功德。茶葉米之用，在平常替病人趕煞送星宿也有同樣的意義。</p>
<p>茶葉米何以有驅邪趕煞的作用呢？人類對於維持生命的事物，都認爲有無上的神力。茶葉解渴，米飯飽腹，得之則生，失之則死，不待説是世間最有力量的；以此類推，秤尺米篩曆本之類，直接間接和維持生命有關的，都變成我們的衛士。魔煞，我們目不能見，耳不能聞，我們請這些有神力的衛士來對付他們。撒米的眞正意義，應該這樣解釋才對。</p>
<p>新婚中的祝福習俗，另有一種儀文。新娘將嫁之日，自洗澡穿衣梳頭戴花，由年老長親爲之詠誦，每做一事，卽有一番祝福語。新娘自家門至轎門，足不粘地，以米袋席地，遞傳而過，名曰傳代。房中帳被衣裳，無不深染靑色，祝其親愛。新婚日，贈客禮物，有瓜子花生之類，祝其子孫綿延。</p>
<p>這種種祝福儀文，和抛茶葉米截然兩段，各不相關，也不可</p>
<p>混作一談。</p>
<p>或問：『俾斯麥嘗謂』熱帶的人拜太陽，因爲太陽在熱帶地方是危險的有熱力的；條頓種拜雷電也是因爲相類的理由。在這種事體裏頭又露出人類的性質，與狗相同，他們愛敬他們所怕的人。』他的解釋，豈不是極正確嗎？』我們該同意</p>
<p>於他的説法，自來拜太陽，拜火拜蛇，以及生殖崇拜，一切素樸的唯物觀，可説是爲神敎</p>
<p>的起源。相信茶葉米可以驅邪，其心理的起源，原是相同的。</p>
<p>我的解釋如此。</p>
<h3 id="c290">剌激 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>行爲論者以刺激去解釋行爲</p>
<p>，謂『一切行爲皆本之於刺激，但刺激的返覆，結果也將減其强度，一直到了最後，會微弱得有點近於麻木不仁。如果同樣的刺激再返覆下去，就會自己連一點感覺也不知道』。這確也頗近於事實。</p>
<p>戀愛是一種較複雜的刺激，有人説，結婚是戀愛的墳墓，這大槪就因戀愛這種刺激達到結婚後就近於飽和了。如果不生新的刺激，舊的刺激就難再引出昔日的情愛。</p>
<p>恐怖也是一種不簡單的刺激。但恐怖的返覆，也能使人麻木，不再恐怖了。俗話説：膽子是嚇大的』，並非無理。幼小時，大人常常用妖怪，老</p>
<p>虎相恐嚇，初聽時，確也有幾分害怕，久聞就不相信了。一個人黑夜出行，開始總不免提心弔膽，見神見鬼的。走慣了晚路的人，刺激旣多，反覺得夜行多趣。</p>
<p>我初次看殺頭時，覺得未免可怕，實在還沒看淸楚就嚇跑了，後來因爲天天有了看殺頭的機會，也就平常了，到了自己朋友也被殺了時，簡直還可替别人從屍堆中去認屍，這眞是非以前所料及的。</p>
<p>總括一句，刺激的返覆可以變更它的本質，是一種眞理。所以做母親的人們利用恐怖政策去嚇嚇孩子，雖然可用於一時，結果反會使孩子大膽起來，生出對於長上輕蔑，不信任的心情。</p>

<p>到柏林的第一天，雨微微地下着。上午，他倆在幾個博物餘去參觀了一會。歐靜麗覺得身體有些不舒服，下午便留在旅館裏。</p>
<p>『我這不舒服，頗奇怪，我倆去訪一個醫生，好不好？』歐靜麗説。</p>
<p>『好，就去。』</p>
<p>他倆就在康德街找到一個醫生。歐靜麗操着德語説了一會。醫生頻頻點頭，玄却半個字也不懂。接着，歐靜麗被引到内室去，過了幾分鐘才出來。歌靜麗請４玄付了商量費，便辭了醫生，仍回到旅館裏。</p>
<p>『親愛的，我有孕了！』歐靜麗一進房門，便帶着頑皮的神氣説。『眞的嗎？』這於玄是一個晴天霹靂。</p>
<p>『怎不眞的，剛才醫生證明的。』她坐到玄身邊來，玄攬住她的腰，她嬌憨地説：我預備考試的時候，你那樣不斷地要求我·我偷懶，我省略了那些預防的手續。這半半個月來，我身體早就有些異樣；果然是這一回事了』！</p>
<p>『親愛的，你問明了毁滅的方法嗎？』玄担心地問。</p>
<p>『問那個做什麽？』</p>
<p>『你不預備解除這來錯了的小生命嗎？這個我倆不能保留的小生命！』</p>
<p>『你爲甚麽説這樣的話？老實話，我正歡喜着呢！你不説過，我倆這段戀愛，沒有什麽相』</p>
<p>稱的紀念品嗎？現在不是紀念品自已來了嗎？難道還有比這更相稱的紀念品？現在你又説不能保留了！』</p>
<p>『保留是可以的·你得犧牲你的家庭，同我回巴黎去！這樣，我們便呆以保留這小生命了』</p>
<p>！』</p>
<p>『親愛的，你原諒我：關於這一點，我的意見。又和你的不同。現在我正要回家去，第一，這旣成的事實，利於我倆婚事的進行；第二，我母親可以看護我和我倆的孩子·你自以爲能够懂婦女們的事嗎？</p>
<p>『如你從前所説的，你母親旣然是那樣自尊心重，她又如何能容忍未嫁的女兒，生下一個孩子呢？</p>
<p>『這是兩回事！這其間因素完全不同。好比我生孩子和嫁你，你，敎會對這兩事的態度，就截然不同的。對家庭，我更有辦法。—總而言之，我不願意犧牲我倆情愛的結晶！我也仍然要回家去。明年三四月間，我解懷以後，我抓着最早的一個機會，便携了孩子來巴黎找你，你不喜歡嗎！</p>
<p>『喜歡的』，玄無可奈何地答了。他知道歐靜麗的固執的脾氣；他體會到女子天性中的母愛；他深信女性應付這種難關的天賦的才能，他沒有什麽别的話可説。他再從反面一想：也許因爲有了這新生命，目前的别離，才不是永訣！有了這一度橋，歐靜麗才可永遠地屬於他呢！他倒又覺得心安理得了。</p>
<p>他倆在栢林度蜜月似地又游覽了幾天，歐靜麗才預備搭車南下。頭一夜，彼此互訴了無數的語言，共結了無數的盟誓！第二天，這永遠嫻雅，窈窕的姑娘，在車窗裏苦笑着揮手，便被火車載去了！玄的眼淚如綫地掉下來。</p>
<p>怱怱地離開了柏林那傷心地，玄獨自回到巴黎。追憶這兩年來的一塲美夢，他沉溺在一種無名的惆悵和焦急裏！每夜，他的夢魂，便辛苦地追隨着多腦河的流水東去！</p>

<h3 id="c292">財部整理田賦之兩提案 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 劉支藩</p>
<p>最近財政部召開全國財政會議，於今日在京開會，召集各省財政當局討論田賦之整理苛捐雜税之廢除及地方預算之編製等項實際重大問題。聞此次會議，尤側重於整理田賦之討論，財部並已擬具兩提案在未提出會議以前、先將此項提案徵詢各省當局及地方人士之意見、期收集思廣益之效，此種虚懷若谷，勵精圖治之精神，良用欽佩。不侫攷察各縣財政有年，對於田賦積弊情形，亦略知一二，覩財部對整理田賦之兩提案，深覺肯中時弊，精　扼要。按財部行將提出會議之兩提案，一爲舉辦土地陳報之計劃，一爲减輕附加以救濟農村經濟之方策，兩提案中除擬具詳細辦法外、對於當今田賦積弊及農村經濟破產之原因，分析甚詳，茲將此二提案原文錄於篇首，以資參攷：</p>
<p>提案（一）</p>
<p>提議整理田賦先舉行土地陳報以除積弊而裕税源敬請公决事</p>
<p>查我國税制，以田賦爲最古，其積弊亦以田賦爲最深；千百年來因革遞變，名目龐雜，税率參差，省異而縣不同，目前魚麟圖册，多半無存，糧戶黃册，亦欠完備。各縣田賦之征收，僅憑胥吏私藏之書册，積習相沿，弊　百出，遂致田糧不符，或有田無糧，有糧無田，而一切衛屯山蕩及城市宅地，在昔以特殊原因，未入册升科者，更所在多有，於是影射隱瞞，飛泗詭寄，中飽包辦，種種弊混，相因而生；人民之所出，不能滴滴歸公，政府之收入，遂日趨於疲困，欠不在民，收不入官。以言根本整理之法，固在舉行淸丈，改征地價税；然按諸現時之國勢民情，人才經濟，尙非短時間所能收效。目前整理田賦，惟有急則治標，治標之法，莫先於舉行土地陳報，先使土地業主將其戶名，田地坐落，四址面積，糧額，自行陳報登記，給以憑證，各縣得據以編成比較正確完備之正式征册，其田糧不符者，藉此得以糾正，有田無糧者，藉此可以升補，有糧無田者，亦藉此可以删除，而原有税率等則紛繁者亦可分别裁併，俾糧　　　，不致畸重畸輕，有此初步工作　　　　　　　　　　先有所稽攷；將來實施淸丈或查報地價等治本之圖，方始便於推行。現在各省政府亦類知田畝與賦額相差甚鉅，惟其淸查之法，皆專以派遣官吏行之，地方利害，民衆憂疑，則多未顧及，故往往辦無成效，其或以用人不當，釀起風潮，此殆謀之不臧，固非事不可行，欲矯其弊，惟有設法使人民對於土地陳報，發生自身之利害關係，然後事方易舉，而效亦易見。茲擬具辦法大網如下：</p>
<p>（甲）各省政府就地方情形詳訂土地陳報章則由縣遴選公正士紳法團代表組織淸賦機關分區勸導人民從事土地陳報以便政府編造征册更訂科則等事宜</p>
<p>（乙）由中央明白規定此次陳報新增之賦額准留充各該地方經費并用以抵補附加藉資奬勵</p>
<p>（丙）凡有地無糧或地多糧少依限陳報者一律准予升補不迫旣往城市無糧宅地尤須儘先舉辦其有隱匿不報經人舉發者應查明從嚴處罰或沒收其隱匿田畝所有罰欵及沒收田畝准分成提充本縣及本區鄉辦理公益之需並奬勵舉發人</p>
<p>（丁）凡依限陳報者或延期陳報者准酌减或酌增其税欵以示奬懲不陳報之土地卽認爲喪失產權移轉抵押繼承均以土地陳報憑證爲有效</p>
<p>（戊）凡辦理陳報人員經政府考核并抽查陳報地畝認爲成績優良者分别予以奬勵</p>
<p>（己）由縣選用原有册書委爲有給員吏并加以切實保障令將原有征册和盤托出以供查核</p>
<p>（庚）由省政府仿照建築師會計師等登計辦法厘定專章考選有測繪學識或經騐人員給以執照准在各縣執行測丈業務以便人民隨時委託測丈田畝</p>
<p>以上所擬辦法，僅就整理田賦之簡易能行者，舉其大端而言之；惟期行之有效，不敢妄談高深。至關於一切法規及實施手續，當由中央與各省察酌地方情形，分别辦理。是否有當，理合提請公决。</p>
<p>提案（二）</p>
<p>提議减輕田賦附加以救濟農村解除民困敬請公决事</p>
<p>查各省田賦，除少數冋無附加者外，大都附過於正，數字雖有不同，而民力難支則一。近自裁厘之後，舉凡一切地方事業，更紛紛於田賦項下，巧立名目，隨正帶征，其間固不乏必需之費，然濫支溢收，亦比比皆是，而各鄉區之遇事攤派，其弊尤甚。昔之以厘金病商者，轉而以附加病農。現在男賦附加超過正税，其至竟。達二十倍以上，値茲農村經濟破產，民力萬分憔悴之際，若不急圖挽救，情勢趨演，民困日深，而共產黨徒，得有所假借，以煽惑民衆，前途隱憂，何堪設想，是以田賦附加，應度察民力，大事削减，然欲圖田賦附加之切實削减，必須將縣地方財政，先納之於整個範圍之中，使田賦附加及其用途，區鄉臚列報縣，縣府　核報省，然後縣地方收支，眞相始能明瞭，而附加之欵，若者立裁，若者暫緩，若者削减，若者限期停征，方有途徑可循，而裁减之後，如果必須抵補，亦始有正確之數額可稽。故確定縣地方預算，實爲限制附加之不二法門。茲擬具辦法大綱如下：</p>
<p>（甲）確定縣地方財政預算將全縣一切經常臨時收支各欵無論縣府各機關以及區鄉公所經收經会均一律編列槪算經縣審查後報請省府嚴加審核</p>
<p>（乙）省政府審核縣地方預算應以田賦附加總額不超過正税爲限其已核准列入預算之縣事業費如因制附加有不敷時除將土地陳報新增之地税留縣彌補外得呈請省府核准撥欵補助如省預算不敷時並得呈請中央核明特准恊濟</p>
<p>（丙）縣地方一切財政收支無論爲縣欵區欵均應由縣財政機關統一審核分别公告並准由各法</p>
<p>團隨時稽查賬目</p>
<p>（丁）縣預算審定公布後遇有預算外之收支非事前經省政府專案核准者應由省厘定懲罰規章從嚴處辦</p>
<p>以上所擬辦法，在使縣地方有確定之預算，以杜苛派濫支，俾附加得實行减輕·爲人民解除痛苦，卽所以救濟農村，遏止亂萌。是否有當，理合提請公决。</p>
<p>　從上兩提案原文觀之，讀者當知財部整理田賦之整個計劃矣，其前案以舉辦土地陳報爲整理田賦之先决問題，後案則以减輕負擔救濟農村爲目前最急最大之任務。茲就管見所及，謹將此兩提案内容，分别評述，藉供全國財政會議與會諸君之參考：</p>
<p>（甲）關於土地理報一案者：</p>
<p>（一）整理田賦究應一律先行舉辦土地陳報否？</p>
<p>查我國田賦，亟須整理，此固盡人皆知；第如何整理，則議者紛紛，莫衷一是。大體言之：洽本莫如淸丈，而治標則莫若查編徵糧册籍；土地陳報，僅查編徵糧册籍方法之一而巳。惟以地方情形，各省互殊，縣各互異，則其查編圖册之方法，自不能削足適履，强其一律。有甲縣應舉辦土地陳報者；有乙縣應舉辦士地調查者；又有丙縣因摧收底册久經收回，祗須舉辦戶名更正卽能適用者。各縣情形旣不同，則其方法，應責由各省政府斟酌各縣情形，分别核定整理方法未可抺煞事實，一律先行舉辦土地陳報者也。按諸江蘇各縣情形，則江寗江陰宜興溧陽等縣，田賦積弊最深，固應舉辦土地陳報；而江南田賦積弊較輕縣份，以及江北各縣，因其情形有别，則應否一律舉辦土地陳報，尙待熟慮之者，例如江北各縣，己有數縣請求於戶口調查時，同時調查田賦，人力財力，均甚經濟，洵輕而易辦一舉兩得之事也，又江南如吳縣等，己將摧收底册收回，所有業戶產權之移轉推割歷史，記載極爲詳盡；如能將其業戶姓名住址，設法更正，則此次册籍，較土地陳報册尤爲完善，蓋陳報册對於以前產權移轉之歷史，斷難查報詳盡無遺也。或謂推收底册，僅係原額有糧册籍，而於隱匿無糧田地，仍無法查出，此誠堪審慮之點。竊以爲查擠隱糧，斷非陳報所可奏效，而非淸丈不爲功。蓋土地陳報，對於查擠隱糧，有可能而不可必。旣聽人民自報，則有多報之者，亦有少報之者，衡諸人情，前者少而後者多，於是多少相冲銷，其能新增出者，仍恐寥寥無幾。爲今之計，對於田賦積弊最深各縣份，應舉行土地查報，一面由政府督率各區鄉鎭，辦理土地陳報；一面由各省地政機關與財廳密切合作，舉行查丈。使陳報與查丈·同時進行，旣可補陳報之不足，又可免將來淸丈之繁難，則簡單的淸丈旣已行，而詳盡的魚鱗册籍復獲，洵至善至美之舉。現蘇省土地淸丈之計劃，業經重新釐訂，已與不合主張頗相近矣。至其他册籍齊全縣份，及前淸已辦淸丈各縣，母庸舉辦土地查報，祇須整頓弓尺推收及田賦徵收制度可耳（二）對於提案所擬各項辦法之批評</p>
<p>（一）對於辦法大綱甲項，應請考慮下列諸點一本辦示大綱，適用於舉辦土地查報各縣；其毋庸舉辦土地查報各縣，不適用之。</p>
<p>二查土地查報，貴在實際推行，應由各省政府愼造各縣縣長，負責切實進行，似不必一律組織淸賦機關。</p>
<p>三查田賦淸查之法，固不應專以派遺官吏行之；然聽民自報，雖力加勸導，亦恐難收實效。故除一面陳報外，同時卽應行舉查文。</p>
<p>四本項條文應修正如左：</p>
<p>『各省政府應酌察地方情形分縣舉辦土地查報詳訂章則由縣遴選公正士绅法團代表參加並督率各區鄉鎭長指導人民從事土地陳報並會同省縣地政機關酌派測丈人員隨時　户查丈之』</p>
<p>（二）對於乙項，應請考慮下列諸點：</p>
<p>一土地陳報之結果，究竟能否新增賦額，尙成問題，能將以往不實在之假册籍，變爲確鑿可靠而與原額相符者，已足望矣：欲求能多出巨量額田，則非同時實施查丈不爲功。否則新增賦額，爲數必寥寥無幾矣。</p>
<p>二如陳報與查丈，同時進行，則隱匿田畝，可悉數查出，而新增賦額必大。但其新賦用途，又須按照各省情形，分别規定，　可一槪而論也。</p>
<p>三就各省現情論，新增賦額之用途至省有四：爲减輕田賦附加之抵補一也，輔助縣地方事業經費二也，償還未省舊債三也。留充全省重要建設事業經費四也。凡此種種，均須由各省酌量分配撥補之。</p>
<p>四本項條文應修正如左：</p>
<p>『由中央明白規定此次查報新增之賦額以百分之四十充各該省重要建設事業經費以百分之六十留充各該地方事業經費並用以抵補附加藉資奬勵』</p>
<p>（三）對於丁項應請考慮下列各點：</p>
<p>一查依限或延期陳報者，准酌减或酌增其税欵一項，其用意無非予陳報者以物質利害之奬懲而已。惟增减税欵，卽加重或减輕人民之負擔，關係至重且鉅，應從長計議，未可輕率從事；且奬懲之方法甚多，毋庸變更賦額，免滋</p>
<p>流弊。</p>
<p>二本項規定應修正如左：</p>
<p>『凡在規定期限内陳報者槪不收費延期陳報者每畝罰收手續費洋五角（罰金加重奬懲自明如此規定似較變更賦額者爲優）不陳報之土地卽認爲喪失產權凡移轉抵押繼承均以土地查報憑證爲有效』</p>
<p>（四）對于己項，應考慮下列各點：</p>
<p>一查繳册書底册，各縣情形不同，有可以繳出者，有不能繳出者，更有圖書册書，混雜不分，册籍散亂，册書秘本亦屬淆亂不明者。此種舊册，勢難完全繳出；卽令繳齊，亦屬無用二陳報册與舊征册，根本不同，無從核對，欲强而核對之，勢必經多少人員，費多少時日，而核對結果，大多數必不相符，則何去何存，以何册爲根據？是徒滋紛擾無濟於事。</p>
<p>三本項條文，原應取銷；但爲消極免除陳報阻撓起見，仍有保留之必要。</p>
<p>（乙）關於减輕田賦附加一案者：</p>
<p>本提案所辦擬法大綱各條，大致尙妥；惟有仍須考慮之者，厥爲减輕田賦之標凖，按提案内之辦法乙項，有『田賦附加總額不超過正税』等語，是附加之核减，悉依正税爲凖，然正税之高低，各省不一，而一省之中，各縣互殊。就江蘇一省言，銀米正供各别，大抵蘇屬各縣，平均每畝征米九升一合零；松屬每畝八升零；常屬每畝六升零；而靖江獨輕每畝僅二升有奇；鎭屬每畝三升五合；太屬之嘉定寳山，每畝二升六合，崇明並無賦，而太倉獨動，與蘇屬等。惟江北各屬，則减輕尤甚。合就銀兩而論，則蘇松常鎭太各屬不同，而各縣之中，又各則互異，其糧賦之參差，科則之繁複，殆亦莫可究詰。蘇省各縣田賦科則，輕重懸殊，負担不一，前淸减賦風潮，卽由此而起。按銀米正税，各縣輕重不一：如南通每畝正税有高至一元零者，他如上海八角二分，靑浦松江七角六分，吳縣七角五分，金山七角四分，奉賢川沙常熟，均高至七角一分以上；又如鎭江每畝高至六角二分，句容僅三角零，江寗僅二角六分；又如崇明啓東高郵漣水等縣，每畝正税最高税率，均在一角以下。而如皐一縣，每畝正税最高亦僅一角六分，全縣正税，共收七萬元，附税收至一百三十七萬餘元之鉅，超過税已在十六倍以上；而按諸百一標凖，正附併計，尙未超過限度。可見各縣正税之高低，與其附税比例之參差，其限度標凖，殊難規定，此乃就一省觀察所得之結果者也。</p>
<p>茲再就全國而論，各省田賦正供，高低互殊，大抵以江浙諸省爲最高，四川預征最鉅、冀省賦税甚輕，湘卾正税輕而附加重，魯省每銀一兩征至四元，而冀省每兩不過二元有奇；蘇省每兩雖僅二元零伍分，然漕米每石征至五元之鉅，爲華北各省所無之現象，故忙漕正供合計，仍較其他各省爲重，惜坊間參證資料不多，未能悉舉全國各省賦税輕重懸殊之實例，要如上所述，已足槪見各省情形未可一律强同者也。</p>
<p>在此省異縣殊之實際狀况下，其核减田賦附加之方法，除按各省農村經濟社會實况分别酌定外，其最要之减賦標凖，鄙見以爲無論如何，不能一律以『附税不得超過正税』爲凖，而應分别各省人民負担情形詳加核定，其原征銀米過重之區，帶征附税應嚴限在正税以下，或最高只能與正税相等；其原征銀米過輕之縣，得較原征正税酌量增高，以矯正過去原征銀米參差之弊，而期負担之公平。</p>
<p>以上所述，均不過就財部己行咨各省市徵求意見之兩提案本身而言，亦不過藉此以表示</p>
<p>個人對整理田賦之理想於萬一。惟全國田賦整理問題，至爲龐雜，欲予詳加論斷，殆非本題範圍以内事，容俟他日再撰長篇詳論之，願我有志改革田賦之高明達士，對財部此項提案，急起精研，詳加辯　，俾全國目前最近切而積弊亦最深之嚴重的田賦問題，獲得最完善之整理方法，以供財政會議之决擇，而期全國一致的見諸實行焉。</p>

<h3 id="c293">論銀行經營房地產 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 俊思</p>
<p>過去一年中·銀行事業的發榮滋長·臻於極點；綜觀一年之中，新行的創設，分行的成立，不下數十餘家，而此數十餘家銀行，莫不大獲其利，各盈餘數萬，數十萬不等。此種現象，於表面上觀之，固爲可慶的盛事，然吾們倘加以精細的檢討，則不難愰然了悉此種現象，實爲銀行畸形的發展，經濟社會組織不健全之反應，因爲銀行事業。决不能脱離休戚相關，相依爲命的工商業而獨榮，所以其影響所及，非惟毫無裨益於困苦的人民，並且對整個社會，更有莫大的爲害。查其原因，蓋自世界經濟恐慌以來，工商不振，百業凋零，銀行對於投資咸感缺乏出路，在在棘手，而農村之加速破產，内地之不靖，又使資金集中都市，流進銀行，銀行家旣感資金之投資困難，又目見各地游資蜂蠭而來，於是不得不羣趨於公債與地產二途。在這種情形下，公債的投資與地產的賣買，卽成爲各銀行於此畸形發展中之主要業務，因爲誰都知道：公債的投資，較其他一切企業之投資爲穩妥，而地產的買賣、又較其他一切企業容易獲利；不過，公債的投資直接固取自國家，間接却取自民衆，其有害於國民經濟之發展，不言可喻；而地產亦如是，表面固振與市面，促進都市的繁榮，實際則造成地價飛漲，使一般平民生活益趨因苦，而陷經濟社會於極端杌隉不安之中。</p>
<p>銀行於其經營固有銀行事業之餘，兼營地產事業，爲近幾年來的事實，泊乎今日，滬上各銀行大都有地產部的設立，由對於地產富有經騐之人材，專司其事；其所營的業務，與普通地產公司大致彷佛，約略言之，可分三點：（一）地產賣買：（二）辦理押欵；（三）房產經租。而地產賣買又可分二項：（甲）銀行受銀東的委託，需要具有某種條件的地皮若干時，銀行卽生注意，留心物色，某處地段適當，某處價廉物美，若能成交，銀行卽可抽多量的佣金，以作酬報：反之，業主若有地皮出售，亦可委託銀行地產部辦理，若能售出，銀行照例可抽佣金。（乙）銀行時常觀察某區市面將日趨繁榮，地價將日見高貴，於是銀行就乘先出低資購進，然後靜待時機，善價售出，短時期内獲利之大，遠非他種企業所能望其項背（二）辦理押欵－擁有房產和地產的業主，遇有要事，急需現金來週轉時，輒將其所有的產業，抵押於人，抵押所得，以救燃眉之急，於此銀行卽運用其過剩的資金，作大量的押欵業務，或保息保贖，或劃租作息，而利息之厚，往往能打至八九厘或一分。（三）房產經租－銀行代擁有房地產的辦理收解等事，而酌量收取手續費。除此之外，吾們可觀察近年來的銀行界，有一並遍的趨勢，卽爲銀行自置房地產，綜觀上海熱鬧市區，富麗堂皇高挿雲霄的高樓大厦，莫不爲各銀行的自置產業，（銀行大厦雖有地皮非銀行所有而是租的，然其屬於自建則一。）銀行本身固然是所需有限，無用多量的辦事處，故各銀行大厦，除三層自用外，一二層以上皆闢爲寫字間，以供出租，於此種情形之下，其按月可收可觀之房租，是必然的結果，其預算的成功，亦爲無可諱飾的事實，不過，我們默察銀行界的這種趨勢，已漸漸有衰落的傾向。</p>
<p>無疑的，銀行自建大厦，出租冩字間，除了交通便利，處境優良的外，有許多銀行的寫字間，都空關着而無人過問，這種現象，證明寫字間的衆多，巳是供過於求，而將入於失敗之列，同時我們也知道，工商的不振，使一般人對於商業，都無心經營，裏足不前·而銀行家更單顧了自己的利益·任意將房租提高·使</p>
<p>房客受到重大的担負，所以我們敢説，在目前銀行對於自建的大厦，出租寫字間，也許尙能保持相當的成功，倘此風不斷，銀行不從另方面謀發展業務，則將來的危險，是無法避免的事。</p>
<p>我們看到，在社會經濟的機構中，與民衆最感到切膚相關的，莫如在支出項下房租支出的浩大；房租的浩大，使一般民衆都感到極大的威脅；對於商家，因房租高昻而營業困難，於是有大部分的商家，感到不能維持，而足危殆的現象，這種現象在去年　歷年底，最爲顯著，雖然大體説來，這現象的由來，是受世界經濟恐慌的影響，但房租的昂貴，使小民不勝担負，亦不失爲主要的原因；而於民家，一則爲了地價的飛漲，一則爲了農村破產，農村人口逐漸脱離農村，往都市謀生，故亦增高至極度，而就在這種情形下，產生了二房東，三房東等特别名目，往往一宅之内，居住者達七八家，人口衆多，衛生不講，居住問題的不能解决，於斯爲極。所以有一部分人士感到自身的痛苦而起來大聲疾呼，要求擺脱，所以减租運動的熱烈提倡而得到反應，不是偶然的而是必然的事實。</p>
<p>同時，我們也看到地產的於銀行。並不是件正當的業務，在這裏，我們應得問一句，難道因爲資金的缺乏出路，而銀行就應該不思打開僵局，專營一些不正當的公債與地產嗎？銀行的代客買賣地產，雖不失爲服務社會，但應該注意的，被服務的究竟是社會中佔少數的富人。我們從另一方面講，銀行是大衆的服務機關，不應當爲了博取目前的一點利益，而忽略了大衆的福利，至於地產的買進賣出，全憑投</p>
<p>機取巧，更非是銀行家應採的營業方針，次於押欵，誰都知房地產是不動產，銀行收受不動產以作抵押借欵，其危險的程度，是何等的深。再次，於房產經租，我們不想説什麽，不過，我們眼見到銀行走上銀行所不應走的路上去，覺得銀行以後應該改變方針，移銀行地產部的力量，去爲社會大衆謀福利，以求解决社會民衆的居住問題。</p>
<p>無論是在理論方面或是實際方面，這並不是不可能的事，銀行利用過剩的資金，在商業市區斟酌情形，收買或租賃適當地皮，建築大批市房，以供出租，這種市房的建築，並不要求富麗堂皇，只要求能切於實用，而最重要的，就是銀行在可能範圍中，應將其房租打至最低限度，以减輕在這苛捐雜税中商人的担負：這種舉止，直接旣是爲商人打開一條出路，間接亦可促進商業的繁盛，市面的振興，就是在</p>
<p>銀行本身也，可使其地位更加鞏固，信譽益發優著，次再應於離開都市稍遠而交通便利的郊外，建築新村式的住宅，這種住宅，或適於中等家庭居住，或適於較次的平民居住，用以解决一般民衆的居住問題。考查這種舉動，對於社會固是件偉大的貢獻，就是銀行本身，按月能收相當的房租，亦並不是無利可圖。不過，所得的利益，不及買賣地產的豐潤是無可諱飾的，但吾們知道，一個銀行對於社會有它相當的責任，决不能爲了貪目前的微利，而忽略了它更重要偉大的使命，所以我以爲銀行應該做幾點服務社會的成績給我們看看，减輕民衆担負，解决民衆居住問題，這是很重要的工作，希望銀行界不要等間忽視！</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>因爲中國各省農村破產；外侮頻來，急須自救，所以當局已將目光移注到西北去了。於是，朝野人士，也一致地，熱烈地，嚷着到西北去，到四北去。但是這决不是空口喊到西北去，便會到西北去的；開發西北是需要偉大的計劃和巨量的經費纔行。更須有多數人的决心苦幹，首先應從農村入手，視事而施。不然，結果還是喊的人多，去的人少，而做的更不必説，當然是沒有的了。西北地處邊隀，區域廣泛，人烟稀少；而因其土質肥沃，故農產極爲豐富，不過連年天災爲崇，致使西北農民，盡成哀鴻！但是，最近幾年以來，内亂頻仍，外患侵凌，當局執政者又以鞭長莫及，不遑兼顧，的確也是一大原因。不久，國府要人邵力子，宋子文，戴傳賢等，均曾親赴西北，作週詳之視察。現對建設西北，已擬定幾項具體辦法；（一）灌漑，因西北旱災己久，所以灌漑事業，實爲開發西北的當前急務。（二）畜牧爲農林副業，而且是有益於農的事業；因此，也不可以缺少的。（三）防治獸疫，旣有了畜牧事業，那末，獸疫的防治工作，亦極爲重要的。（四）農村合作，改良方法，充實力量，以增農基的鞏固。</p>
<p>吾們對於上面這幾項建設西北的辦法，毫無懷疑的地方；可是·吾現在所要説的幾點，却不是那麽簡單的事情；乃是吾要敬向開發西北當局，應提出來貢獻的一些兒意見。無疑的，這是吾們未到西北以前應做的工作，未談建設西北以前應有的凖備。</p>
<p>怎樣纔能够去開發西北，這是一個绝大的疑問；然而，這問題的本身，吾們無論如何總是値得研究的。現在依吾的主張，要去開發西北，只要利用犯人和貧民，送赴西北去充墾荒工作的苦役；一方面由政府撥出巨大的經費，去興辦各項建設事業，同時，並希望金融界和資本家，儘量地投資農林事業或建設事業，俾使得其發展與繁榮。至於商業，敎育，衛生，治安，交通，水利，農墾等，各項建設，皆宜分别設立而促進之。所有選派到西北去的犯人，應酌量减其罪刑幾分之幾，刑期滿後，再分别給予相當工作。貧民應每人給他幾畝山地，和幾畝田；在建設期内，可以自由耕種，不收地租地價，不徵任何捐税。更宜斟酌情形，創辦實業工廠，招收失業工人前去工作：方可救濟和建設並進</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>講到開發西北，應分爲幾步步驟，定奪後，再遂步進行；第一步凖備，第二步試行，第三步實施。俟這三步完成後，便可更進一步建設，改進了。吾想照這樣辦法，雖不敢説事半功倍，可是至少也有相當成績的。</p>

<p>— 白榕</p>
<p>遠東動會開幕以後，我國除足球以外，别的都很少希望，尤其是田徑賽，幾乎全軍覆沒。眞是十足惋惜的事。可是消息傳來，我國女子游泳竟由楊秀瓊等的努力連奪幾個冠運。不但關心運</p>
<p>動的人聽聽興奮，卽我們每一個中華人民，都要爲之雀躍三百的。報紙上又説：菲島人批評我國女選手非比賽運動而來，是比賽美麗而來的。這樣一來，竟完全推翻了這些無聊的批評。於是引起我一些小小的感想：運動的目的在於培養强健的體力，除此以外，還可以涵育德性，訓練智慧，並造成健而美的體格，這是人所共知的事實。在二十世紀的新時代裏，舊日衡量美醜的標凖己經全不適用，林黛玉式東方型纎弱體格己經成了被淘汰被擯棄的東西。在這時代，懸爲我們美麗標凖的，是康健的，力的，活躍的精神。可是這祇能由平素勤習運動注意養生可以得到，决非以人工的矯揉造作所能弄成功。塗巴黎香粉，搽蔲丹指油，點痣，燙髮，不過是把封建時代的修飾技術拿來用新的方法複演一下罷了。人雖然披着『摩登』的外衣，骨子裏却和林黛玉式的女子毫無兩樣。奢侈，病弱，浮艷，處處在開着倒車，處處在做着『腐化』工作。這現象，在都市裏已是數見不鮮的事實。</p>
<p>因之，我們希望敎育當局能一面遏抑奢侈浮華的學風，一面提倡健美的運</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>動。而在體育塲上，尤應注意眞的强健體格之培鍊，和眞的競技精神之養成，把體育的眞諦散播於學生們頭腦之中。　　至於代表整個民族出席國際運動會的選手，更應特别愼重，因爲他們的一舉一動都與全國的名譽有關。過去的不提，卽以這次遠運而論，菲島人對我女選手之汚蔑當然過於狂妄，可是我門反躬自問，我國的『女健兒們』是否眞有引起人誤會的地方呢？爲什麽他們對别國的女選手不加嘲笑而單單嘲笑我們呢？因爲這，我想起有一隊女球隊員因打球時在腿上搽粉因而引起異邦人譏笑的事，越覺得社會人士應當大聲疾呼來遏制這種不良的傾向。一個隊員的奢華浮艷會影響到全體選手，而全體選手的背後則站着整個的民族。代表中國的選手不但應把國旗縫在衣上，並且也應將牠縫在整個的心上。這樣纔會嚴肅從事，而不會想到這是到外國去出風頭，去賽美，而結果祗帶回來譏笑，却沒帶回一點錦標！</p>
<p>這次楊秀瓊等能以實力競爭，爲國增光，是値得佩服的，可是我並沒以成敗來抺殺其他女選手，卽以排球而論，女選手們失敗後的痛哭雖是好勝心受了摧折，可是也可看出她們愛國的熱忱。我希望各選手歸國之後，能互相督促，避免虚榮的誘惑，刻苦地鍜鍊出更强健的體格來。康健的美麗纔是不折不扣的眞正美麗，體力充足的光榮纔是貨眞價</p>
<p>實的光榮，眞懂得這個，那麽蔲丹·香粉·唇膏，都變爲毫無意義的了。</p>
<h3 id="c305">關於托兒所與兒童公育 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 師石</p>
<p>最近本市當局創辦了一處較具規模的</p>
<p>托兒所，這在『社會建設』的意義上，無疑的是很有價値的，我國歷來一般類此的塲合，如固有的育嬰堂保赤所與普育堂等等，大都爲了收容被擯棄的無主孩提而設，僅是一種在狹義的人道主義下所營慈善事業而己，像這種具有社敎思相的純粹代育機關，在我國似乎還是創舉，而設辦托兒所的理論根據，大抵基於歐美『兒童公育』的學説，這對於社會進化，婦女經濟，和嬰兒敎養諸問題，都有密切的關繫，所以此次本市與辦托兒所，假如其動機不僅爲了具文式的外觀裝點，我人便不妨假定的認爲普遍實施公育的第一步驟，那末，這問題似乎不是沒有注意的價値的。</p>
<p>兒童公育在歐美頗呈活躍，而在蘇俄更能切實施行，著有成效。他們對於公育的設施，殊形縝密，規定每若干人口間，必需特設一公育區，包括收生處，胎兒所，哺乳所，嬰孩醫院，嬰孩遊憇塲，幼稚園，兒童體育塲，兒童健生房，兒童小工藝塲，兒童圖書館，兒童感化院等等，並遴聘專家，組織兒童研究所，對於兒童生理兒童心理兒童敎育兒童訓育等，隨時研討，推諸實行，以期臻於至善至美之境，這種大規模的公育機關，直會給予我人以莫大的憧憬咧，關於主張兒童公育的理論體系，在歐美約可分爲兩派：一是社會主義派，可以蕭伯納等人爲代表，他們特别着眼於社會進化的效率上，認婦女爲『社會人，』</p>
<p>並非附屬於家庭之一員，所以主張改革家庭制度，解放婦女的地位，以提供於社會的任務，而養育兒女的責任，當然應由社會負担了，二是女性主義派，可以基爾曼等爲代表，他們着眼於婦女本身的權益，主張婦女的經濟獨立與職業的解放，以公育來調劑她們的家累，這兩派的主張，各有學理上根據，立塲雖不相　，但對實施公育的結論，却珠塗而同師的。</p>
<p>此次本市創立托兒所，其立塲想亦不外上述二派，筆者膚受淺嘗，當然不能在學理上有所非議，不過就我人觀察現時我國的社會情况，國民經濟，文化程度和家庭觀念的種種相，是否亟需推行公育，覺得尙有存疑之點値得細加商榷的。</p>
<p>現代我國的社會機構，由於國民經濟的突蹶與文化水凖的低落，十足顯現其畸形的病態，婦女們從事於職業，實際上　是　　短時的靑春，所謂負趨社會的任務，更是一個淸秋盡夢而已，有人説女性以結婚爲唯一職業，雖屬誚語而實有至理，那末現社會旣不能爲一般育有兒女的母親保留著相當的職位，這種專供代育的托兒所，當已失去了存在的必要性，而且婦女對於兒女本有一種天然的『母職，』此種母職在倫理上是絶對的義務，對社會是一種相對的義務，而兒童是未來社會的中堅，婦女扶育兒女臻於身心的健全、也就是替社會服務，這種任務的眞價値，較諸在機關裏當花瓶商塲中當活招的職業，其偉大與卑微，何啻宵壤，是則托兒所的存在，更顯然的失去了他的理論根據了。</p>
<p>再説兒童與家庭，復有不可須臾離的相互關繫，兒童是家庭的幸福中心，夫婦勃谿，往往以兒女爲維繫情感的工具，而兒孫繞膝，才能搆成天倫之樂。杜威説『沒有兒女便使家庭Ｈｏｕｓｅ成爲房屋Ａｃｍｅ所以推行公育，必將破壞家庭的完整。家中僅剩幾個大人，成爲冷酷世界，有何生趣可言。而家庭又是兒童的生活之樂園，父母之愛，是兒童生命上唯一的糧食，否則便難生存，今欲以弱嫩嬰孩，托命於不相干的第三者，眞是莫大的殘酷行爲，據法國巴黎一市統計，公育兒童的死亡率超過尋常兒童三倍以上，那末托兒所不成了一個絶大的危機嗎？並且現時我國經濟躓厄，民窮財盡，中產以下的家庭，决無餘力向托兒所按月支付一筆代育費，如有兩個以上的兒女，實遠不如自已哺乳的節省。所以托兒所設立，事實上却徒爲一般沾花惹草的紈袴子弟大開方便之門，結果恐將成爲私生子與姦生子的尾閭；這與舉辦托兒所的初衷，未免違離太遠了。</p>
<p>以上是筆者個人的主觀見解，也許有人會譏爲落伍。但我相信我的態度是很誠篤的。</p>

<p>編者先生</p>
<p>『布衣救國這個口號能救國麽？』數年前（在一九一八』『一二八』的時候，我已經着手過這個運動了。那時因我還是一個未滿師的學徒，智識淺陋，力量單薄，不能遍勸國人，甚屬憾事。那時所暢勸的。皆屬於我的知己，如『親戚』</p>
<p>友朋』『宗族』等等。當然，效力是有限的，現在際此國家危急之秋，又觸起我的遺憾，所以，寫此一封信來請問你了。</p>
<p>（一）如何宜達全國，使人人都購買國</p>
<p>棉布</p>
<p>（二）鄉　中行此法是很容易的（因他們節儉之數）而對於繁華的都市如『上海』『漢口』『南京』等是很難行的。何法可以改善易行？</p>
<p>（三）對外貨的布匹，如何制止其暢銷？其　銷　原因何在？</p>
<p>（四）此問題對於國家利益的深淺。</p>
<p>（五）中國土布　爲何不能爲大多數人消費？</p>
<p>（六）以何法鼓舞大衆購買土布的熱心。</p>
<p>（七）國内土地寬宏，棉花出產爲何獨稀？何法使鄉人改良，增加收穫，使工廠不用外棉。</p>
<p>以上問題請你盡力指導，不但有益</p>
<p>於國家，人民經濟亦得微微活動矣。我現在在櫃檯上做生意的時候，兼宣傳我</p>
<p>的主張，勸農民切勿購買外布，外布是不及中國布耐久堅牢並經濟的？我雖然是這般苦心規勸，不知天公能使我達到願望否？專上敬祝</p>
<p>撰祺許竹友</p>
<p>答：你所詢的問題有許多是重複的，所以合籠來答覆你。救國的口號多得很，如『讀書救國』『航空救國』等等，『布衣救國』不過這些口號中的一個而已。提倡『布衣救國』者的宗旨不外二</p>
<p>者，發揚儉樸美德和開展民族經濟。你所注重的是後者，現在我們就來討論後者的意義。</p>
<p>在一百年前我們决不會有這個口號，我們那時穿的都是土布，但是穿土布的結果我們的國家却沒有得救，反而堕入更悽慘的命運中。現在提倡土布的原因，就是國民用『外布』者日多，而用『國布』者日少，所以，我們要使人民都買土布，必定要使『外布』在華沒有人買，没有人用考外貨所以在華傾銷的原因，不外乎二者，物美價廉，和外貨在華有種種特權，可不受苛捐雜税的囉唣　　所以，我們要發達本國的民族經濟，或較具體地説，振興本國實業，或更切實地説，國民大人都用自己貨物，以免利權外溢，我們就應當把外貨在華傾銷的條件取消。外國布物美價廉，我們本國布物更美價更廉。加高關税的税率，使外國貨成本檯高，同時取消苛捐雜税，使本國布價錢降低。這樣，國布還有不行銷的道理麽，還有誰肯去買外國布的道理麽？</p>
<p>編者對於一切有志救國的人都是非常欽敬的，但對於他他所採取的手段却常常不能滿意，提倡『布衣救國』者的動機是很純正的，但這種運動却未必能見諸實行，其效果也不見得於國計民生有補。人窮了，不要救國也穿土布，反之，受愛國心的鼓勵，而穿土布，則終究是不能持久。卽使能持久，也救不了國。鄉下農民有許多都是穿『土布』，但國家却不因他們穿了土布而獲救，他們自己反而窮困異常，要國家去救。推而廣之，人人都穿『布衣』，但人人都鬧窮，國家變成了『穿布國』，但要常受帝國主義者的壓迫，這樣，『國家』『人民』又得了什麽救呢？抛開目的不説，單就實現上講，則前面我們所説的使人民用『國布』不用『外布』的兩種有效方法，在現狀下，也必不能見諸實行。取消外國在華所受特權，或要求加高關税，現在一般胆小，如　的人們，怎敢向外國提出，自己造出東物美價廉的貨，當然能抵制外貨。不過拿今日的我國及世界各國的各經濟結構作一比較，這也是不可能的。</p>
<p>因此，我們知道要救中國，不是靠着枝枝節節的補救所能奏效的。我們救中國的唯一方法就是解除帝國主義者加在中國身上的一切束縛，亦卽是中山先生遺囑所説的『取消一切不平等條約。』</p>
<p>至於如何去實現，則編者認爲，我們唯有堅决的抱着寗爲玉碎不爲瓦全的態度，與帝國主義者相週旋，纔能達到目的。編者</p>

<h3 id="c310">爲什麽明星做不得母親（下） <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>好萊塢生產率的低降</p>
<p>明星生子即犧牲前程</p>
<p>我們首先要提到的，當然就是那位以『好母親』著名的葛蘿利亞史璜遜了。她是嫁過幾個丈夫的，但是婚姻並沒有阻檔她的前程。她後來因愛孩子心切，但是不敢自己生孩子，就抱了幾個螟蛉子女，就還沒有影響到牠的前程。直等到她仍舊感覺到膝下空虚而必須自己生孩子，她的前程就受了極大的打擊。她自己作了母親就喪失了明星的地位。她雖拚命地奮鬥着，要想重返銀幕，但是她的那種艱難困苦，比之牠從前做游泳女子時候努力向上，還是有過之無不及也。最近她雖然已經博得影界當局的同情，而由舊僱主米高梅公司給了她一個合同，但恐那亦不過米高梅對於一個容顏老去的女明星一個同情的表示而己。瑙瑪希拉總是常常被人提到，而認爲做母親不足以毁壞前途的一個女明星。但是讓我們來較比精密些地來考查一下。她的確是個大明星－有驚人的美貎，特出的個性，和表演的特才。她又嫁了那麽大勢力的電影企業家，歐爾文泰爾伯－他亦是竭力帮助她爲重返銀幕而奮鬥的一個人。但是，自從她做了母親之後，比較以前如何？她生子後所主演的片子是ＡＦｒｅｅＳｏｎｌ可是那張片子，可以説是於她毫無裨益。那張片子，造就了克拉克蓋博，里昻巴里摩亞，和李思廉郝華德等幾個人的更大的聲名，而瑙瑪希拉反　依然故我，毫無進展。雖然她的容顏未老藝術不减，自己又努力，又有一位勢力炙手可熱的丈夫帮助她，但是要她能够恢復以前第一流主角的地位，恐怕是其難無比了。　　我們再舉一個例，就是海倫黛蕙芙德麗絲（ＨｅｌｅｎＴｗｅｌｖｅｔｒｅｅｓ）。她在幾年以前，放棄了銀幕生涯，去生一個孩子。那時她所處的是一等角色的地位，薪水是每週二千七百美金。但是她輕輕地放棄了。她本來想生個孩子，休養過幾個月，就可以重登銀幕的。她不知道，她冒了絶大的危險，所以等到她生子以後及恢復了體康之後，她發現了她明星的地位，已經降到一個普通演員的地位了。並且她還要從頭做起，因爲覓事的艱難，她竟不得不屈就小角色而支小薪水了。她説：『我要證明我的能力一絲沒有退步，因此我不得不竭力奮鬥一。不錯的，她的能力一些沒有喪失，但是影界之中，瞬息千變，在她生兒子的幾個月中，世界已經不是她從前的世界了。</p>
<p>這種例子，眞是不勝枚舉。蓓蓓但尼爾絲亦是其中的一個。其他名氣較小一些的，更不必提了。有人説一個女明星生兒女在先，成名在後的，她的兒女不見得會影響到她的地位的。卽如瑪琳黛德麗許，她在未成名之先，早就有了瑪麗亞。但是她却總不敢在『凱塞琳女皇』（ＳｃａｉｌｅｔＥｍｐｒｅｓｓ）裏，讓她的女兒和觀衆見面。後來她雖讓她的女兒在那張片子裏一露色相，但是結果如何，她還有些惴惴不安。她的確是個小心到萬分的人了。（完）</p>

<p>的傷感，損傷了甚至於消失了向上的熱情，因此，傷感的手法，對於前進的作家，應當廢棄不用；爲了劇的效果之有力的强調。那末對於這種寫上層社會之生活靡爛的傷感手法的運用，又應當怎樣解釋呢？也許有人説；他們在減亡過程中的傷感，我們且讓他們嘆息去罷，對於我們可以無關。不過這一理由不是完全正確的，當聰明的作者，利用了强調的傷感，而要我們同情我們所不應同情的人，於是這是作者的勝利，而對於脆弱的觀衆們，却是一種損失了，雖然作品中間，並沒有若何程度的毒汁。　　記得華納公司的女婿（卽『亡命者』的導演洛萊）在日本發表談話之中，曾經説過華納公司製作影片的特點，主要的是故事的新穎，甚至於經常請好些人從報章雜誌上找取劇本材料。這句話從洛萊嘴中道出，我們很可相信。那末這『浮生若夢』的故事之所謂曲折離奇，的確不是偶然的了。</p>
<p>的確，浮面的看來，這裏的故事是十分離奇曲折的。關於這一點，我想是不必抄説明書介紹的，反正看過的人總會承認的。然而正因爲爲了有意使其曲折，所以是使用着詭辯的方法組織起來的。免不了在結構上有不够眞實的地方，而許多過於理想化了的地方，便將革蘭茜絲所飾的舞女，寫成一個超人了。　　自然我們懂得劇作者是使女主人公李力向上的，在舊觀念的解釋之下，她從舞女的生活中成爲賢妻良母。她雖然有着愛好賭博的遺傳性，她雖然精於賭博，但是她却想努力做人，利用她的巧技而敎誡自己的女兒不要賭博，甚至於對於博棍也是如此。就是這樣，她成爲一過超人，她因爲殺人的嫌疑而坐了二十年牢，到後來爲了女兒而甘受罪，雖然因着流氓的政治勢力而得免於罪。更顯明的是在船上偶然的認識了賭棍之後，立刻便良心發現的將赢來的錢還給他，這决不是一般平凡人所能做到的。　　然而，劇作者始終是一個詭辯家，在他的創作手法中，這種小的地方是不會給人注意的。譬如他始終不使那女兒認識母親，這增加了極大的悲劇力量。　　自然，這作品的主題是反對賭博。而另方面對於法律，也是相當暴露了不淸明的缺點。但是從主人公的個性發展來説，這個却是女人的墮落沒有其必然性的。不過他是詭辯的强姦了觀衆的感情，這一個不應爲我們同情的人，終於使人們同情了。</p>
<p>説到詭辯與强姦，耶末我們當然不會忽略這一位現在中國察看『煤油燈』之外景的法人導演ＲｏｂｅｒｔＦｌｏｒｅｙ了。他使用着極純熟的電影手法强調了劇的傷感。編輯的經濟，叙述的淸順，不濫用音樂，不趨俗的製造噱頭或讀張，在極細微之中，用着靜的音響以增加劇中人心理變化，對於劇中人充分的使其戲的發展。</p>
<p>感傷是劇的一切，感傷也是導演人最大的勝利。</p>
<p>主角凱第蘭茜絲又飾了和『未了塵緣』同一情調的角色，然而是她獲得了自己所主演的全部作品中最高的成績了</p>

<p>這是喬治·凱萊（ＧｅｏｒｇｅＫｅｌｌｖ）的喜劇改編的作品，輕鬆，滑稽，和一些</p>
<p>輕微的對人生的諷刺。</p>
<p>故事的大部分，是由巧合凑成的，結束，也可以説是不近情理，但是在那編劇者無意之中，却反映了不少對於現代婚姻問題的諷刺，而微微地透漏了一些小市民層的悲哀。當然，這祗是無意中的流露和反映而已。</p>
<p>一個善於誇示富有而實質上却是貧窮的俸給生活者，因爲一個偶然的機會而娶了一個地產公司所有者的女兒，但是結婚之後就因爲『本質』暴露，而『大受岳家奚落』，『女尤悲憤之至，促其離去』。這一段倒是日常可以聽到和看到的事情。以後，經過了轉輾流浪，淪落到街頭『掮廣告牌者』，這也是現階段薪給生活者（尤其是歡喜裝闊的薪給生活者）所該有的遭遇，可是，美國影片當然不讓這樣悲劇地終塲，於是照例的再用一兩個偶然的機會，使他『時來運來』</p>
<p>，夫婦重歸於好。很明白，祗要觀衆稍稍淸醒一點，就可以知道這種『時運』之不可多得，而這樣的夫婦是往往不能『重歸於好』的。</p>
<p>反映社會之眞實的地方，都很動人，如受岳母的奚落，和受妻子的譏諷等等，但是，那些關於『時運』的地方，就不免使人感到是在做戲。史本塞·屈萊山的好演技，値得一看。</p>

<p>明星公司因爲太看重這部片子的緣故，所以不惜以全力赴之，女演員有宣景琳，高情蘋，艾霞等，的一批，男的有龔稼農，鄭小秋，王徵信等的一批，但事實告訴我們，這部『二對一』並未因有這許多的優秀演員，而演出較爲優美的成績，原因是因爲故事太散漫以義識太糢糊，導演者旣得不到指揮進展的中心，演員更抓不到發揮情感的目標，所以除了跳舞，唱歌，喝香檳酒外，可説什麽都沒有了，這是我們深引爲可惜的地方！</p>
<p>演員個人的表情，龔稼農與王徵信比較好些，女演員都是毫無情感之可言，兩次的比球，因爲凑接太多的毛病，所以很欠緊張，但明星爲什麽要以全力而來演這麽淺薄的一個劇本呢？除了感覺無戲作之外，恐怕也是爲了避免操刀者的吹求吧。</p>

<p>殷納絲跑到亞爾的公事房裏的時候，哈雷己經拿到了五千塊錢走了。殷納絲不知道，還要呌亞爾設法使哈雷不要走。亞爾告訴她，哈雷剛劇拿到五千塊錢。殷納絲聽了，就跳了起來和他大鬧。她駡他。　説：『我一向當你是朋友，原來你是這樣沒有心肝的』亞爾由着她去鬧，因爲他自己知輕他做的事，完全是爲殷納絲，並沒有做錯。况且他自已亦是深愛著她，現在哈雷走了，他可以慢慢設法使她忘懷於哈雷的。殷納絲正在吵鬧的時候，李却跑了進來，他告訴亞爾説，哈雷要和雷那德夫火一同逃走了。亞爾不相信道：『你瘋了吧！』</p>
<p>李却哼著道『我瘋了？他們剛才分手。我看住了她。她後來從邊門溜了出去，走停哈雷的車子裏去了。她現在還在車子裏等著哈雷，等他表演完了，就要動身的。』殷納絲聽呆了，一時説不出話來。亞爾勃然大怒道：『拐逃巴黎最有勢力的一個人的妻子！這是他對我的報答！我的酒店都要開不成了！』</p>
<p>亞爾立卽走到邊門外面，尋著了哈雷的車子，他拿着電筒向車子裏照著，果然看見雷那德夫人微做一團。他説道：『雷那德夫人，一千個對不住。有人告訴我説你走錯了。到别人』</p>
<p>的車子裏去了。』美麗的麗安妮説道：『不錯的，但是謝謝你這樣小心。我的丈夫和我要和這車的主人一同回家哩。』亞爾道：『好極了。我去告訴雷那德先生，説你在這裏等著裏。』</p>
<p>麗安妮連忙攔住道：『不用，不用，他自己會來的。』亞爾念頭一轉，心想不能不換個策略。他説道：『雷那德夫人，我們什麽時候，可以開誠布公呢？』雷那德夫人假裝不明向道：『什麽開誠布公？』亞爾於是很冷靜地説道：『你要明白，你的丈夫是我的一個知交，亦是常常照顧我得酒店的。要是我讓他的夫人做錯了什麽事，他一定怪我的，明白嗎？』麗安妮很生氣地道：『不明白！』亞爾於是很鄭重地警告她道：『要是你諮這裏和哈雷同走了，你要終』</p>

<h3 id="e2">To Preside Over Financial Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Speaks with Secretariat Staff - Schedules Meetings with Provincial Representatives</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because the National Financial Conference will open on the morning of the 21st, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, along with Counselor Li Yuwan and Secretary Zeng Rongpu, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on a Ford aircraft on the afternoon of the 20th. They landed at the Ming Palace Airport at 5:45 p.m. Vice-Minister Qin Fen and Kong's sons and daughters were all there to welcome him. After disembarking, Kong told people that his hopes for the financial conference would be detailed in his opening remarks, and that after this conference, the nation's finances would be able to obtain fully practical consolidation measures. He then boarded a car to rest at the Ministry of Finance. At 7 p.m. in the evening, he called a meeting of key personnel from the conference secretariat to discuss the arrangements and proposals from various parties, asking in great detail. He also personally inspected the general assembly venue for a week. It is reported that Kong will schedule meetings to receive representatives from various provincial governments and directors of finance departments in order to consult on the local financial situation in various provinces and remedial measures. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Bingfang, secretary of the financial conference, stated that the conference secretariat had received over one hundred proposals as of the 20th. However, some of them were provincial financial plans for the 23rd year, temporarily converted into proposals. The secretariat is currently sorting them out separately. If they are proposals, they will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion. If they are plans, they will be submitted to the review committee for reference. As for the mission of this conference, it can be divided into two parts: 1. Establish slightly tighter restrictions on provincial budgets, so that they cannot be arbitrarily increased in the future; 2. Reduce the burden on the people. Recently, outsiders have misunderstood the purpose of the conference, thinking that after reducing miscellaneous levies, new items will be established to compensate. It is expected that the general assembly will overturn this proposal. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ning Nanshan, Director of the Shaanxi Finance Department, arrived in Beijing from Shaanxi on the 20th to attend the financial conference. He stated that Shaanxi Province is currently still peaceful, and bandits have been gradually suppressed. However, due to years of disasters and droughts, the financial situation is exceptionally strained. Although efforts have been made to rectify the situation, income still cannot cover expenditures. After the reduction of land taxes, it will be even more difficult to sustain. He has come to discuss compensation measures with the central government to help maintain the situation. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Secretariat of the Financial Conference held a reception for reporters at 5 p.m. on the 19th. Gao Bingfang, an official of the conference, reported on the methods for providing news, mainly as follows: (1) The conference has received a total of seventy-five proposals to date. The content can be summarized in four words: practical and detailed. In particular, the proposals from various experts do not contain any empty talk of theory, and are all concise and practical. (2) Eighty members have already registered. All provincial governments have representatives, and all directors of finance departments and bureaus are rushing to attend the meeting. (3) The conference will focus on the situation in various provinces and discuss them in detail in order to find good and feasible solutions. (4) The conference will focus on reducing land tax surcharges and abolishing miscellaneous levies. As for the methods of providing news, the main points are: to prepare more printed materials, designate personnel and locations to receive reporters, and provide as much publicly available information as possible.

<p>(Beiping) In Anyingzhai, the fifth district of Miyun County, on the morning of the 17th, Yang Zicheng, a pseudo-police patrol leader, led more than ten police officers to establish a branch office there and began investigating household registrations and fields. In Zunhua County, a large number of traitors are fooling villagers into planting cotton. Currently, some farmers have even plowed up their fields to plant cotton. It is said that their intention is that the Japanese are preparing for war against Russia, and cotton is a key raw material for manufacturing military supplies. Because the climate in the Northeast is not suitable, they are finding ways to do so within the customs. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Recently, several employees of the Osaka Industrial Company of Japan have established a cotton planting committee in the county to provide farmers with loans and fertilizers and encourage the planting of Japanese cotton, planned by the Japanese. The association has also established more than ten county branches in Lulong, Fengrun, Zunhua, Qian'an, Miyun, etc., intending to seize the cotton-producing areas of North China for the Japanese to enjoy.

<p>(Tianjin) Four Japanese planes flew from Chengde to Malanyu on the 19th and landed at the local airfield. In addition, more than 300 Japanese troops arrived in the area from Jinzhou. All the hotels and restaurants in the town were occupied, and some who could not find accommodation went to Saheqiao to temporarily reside. Japanese troops are stationed in the Malanyu long-distance telephone and telegraph bureau to handle military communications. The military long-distance telephone line built by the Japanese troops between Malanyu and Saheqiao has been completed and was tested on the 18th.</p>
<p>(20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops in Jixian began withdrawing to Malanyu yesterday morning, divided into two batches. The first batch of more than 150 people, led by a lieutenant, withdrew at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. The remaining 50, led personally by Hayashida, completed their withdrawal at 2:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The security team under Wang Zhanyuan has arrived in Jixian from Sanhe. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There has been a sudden increase in Japanese troops in Malanyu, and five Japanese planes have flown in from Jinzhou, bringing the total to over twenty, and many puppet troops have also arrived. They are conducting various combat exercises day and night. (20th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese troops in Jixian withdrew to Malanyu on the 19th, the Wang Zhanyuan unit of our Second Security Brigade returned to Jixian at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon to maintain order. In addition, Yin Rugeng has been negotiating with the Japanese side for days regarding the takeover of Malanyu, and progress has been made. It is expected to be realized next month. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming plans to convene a meeting of county chiefs in the Luanyu Administrative Region in Tangshan on the 25th to discuss diplomatic and administrative matters in various counties. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of the passes on the Great Wall that have not been taken over was raised for consultation at the Yuguan meeting this time. Malanyu is expected to be taken over next month. Matsui is scheduled to fly from Chengde to Changchun on the 27th of this month to discuss the matter with the headquarters of the Kwantung Army. The remaining passes, such as Jieling, Lengkou, Yiyuan, and Xifeng, are all stationed with Japanese troops and puppet police and gendarmerie, making a solution difficult. It has been agreed that the puppet police in Gubeikou will withdraw from the first of next month. The withdrawal point for the puppet police is in Bashikaying, which is in the boundary of Luanping County. The Japanese troops in Gubeikou have decided not to move. The Japanese troops in Saheqiao in Xifengkou have recently been building barracks, intending to stay for a long time. The entrance of Xifengkou is equipped with a puppet police station, and the director is a Japanese named Harada Yuichi, who is very strict in inspecting travelers. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Yu Xuezhong Talks About the Special Police Problem in the War Zone <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the newly formed special police in the war zone, according to the Tanggu Agreement, were originally to number 9,000, but we have now formed 8,000, with 5,000 rifles, divided into two general brigades. The first brigade leader is Zhang Qingyu, currently stationed in Cangxian, and the second brigade leader is Zhang Yantian, currently stationed in Caicun. The general brigade is divided into eight districts, and the detachments will be</p>
<p>stationed in the Luanyu and Jimin districts to maintain order. In addition to the Ye Lei and Liu Zuo Zhou units, the remaining units of Wei Yonghe, Zhou Yuying, and Dou Xizhe are all being transferred back for rest. However, during the rotation, it is feared that bandits will take the opportunity to cause trouble, so the various disputes in the war zone must first be resolved with the Japanese side before implementation can be carried out. As for the Jixian dispute, the Japanese side was initially extremely rude, intending to confiscate the light and heavy machine guns of our militia security team. After Commissioner Yin's negotiations, it has now been resolved. As for the abolition of excessive levies, it should be handled urgently, but it can only be maintained if there are compensation measures, otherwise, all administrative affairs will have to be completely suspended. Reports that Hebei Province has as many as 300 kinds of excessive levies are somewhat exaggerated. In reality, there are only dozens. If the central government can provide subsidies for political expenses, it can be completely abolished. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch) (Beiping) The newly trained security team in the war zone has completed its training and, after negotiations with the Japanese side, is scheduled to move to the war zone for rotation on July 1. It is divided into two large brigades, the first brigade, Zhang Qingyu's unit, stationed in the Luanyu district, and the second brigade, Zhang Yantian's unit, stationed in the Jimin district. The original security teams of Dou Xizhe, Wei Yonghe, Zhou Yuying, etc., are all transferred back for training. Zhao Lei and Liu Zuozhou will remain in Luandong, defending the original positions.

<h3 id="e6">Qin Fen Talks About League of Nations Technical Cooperation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen, Secretary of the Economic Council, recently returned to Nanjing after being summoned to Jiangxi by Chairman Chiang to discuss various tasks in the recovered bandit areas. He stated that the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China only involves sending experts to provide technical guidance, so the League of Nations Advisory Committee accepted Lehman's recommendation to send several more technical experts to China to assist the Construction Commission. China will send personnel to foreign countries to carefully study all practical technologies. In addition, there is no other assistance of any other nature. At present, China must also redouble its efforts to break through difficulties, and there is no need to completely rely on others. Regarding the League of Nations' discussion of China's technical problems, all details have been reported to the central government by Representative Gu by telegram, and the content is roughly the same as that reported in various newspapers. As for the term of office of advisor Lehman, it expires in September of this year. Whether he will return to China to work again will be decided by the League of Nations.

<p>Misinterpretation of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<h3 id="e8">British Foreign Secretary's Remarks Cause Repercussions - US Sees as Unfortunate as Previous Remarks Recognizing Japanese Privileges - Shi Makes Statement That Treaty Signatory Countries Should Bear Dual Obligations <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Washington dispatch of the London Observer regarding Chinese affairs stated that the British Foreign Secretary Simon's remarks yesterday regarding not being responsible for the integrity of the Nine-Power Treaty are considered as unfortunate as the British Foreign Secretary's previous remarks recognizing Japan's special rights in China. If Japan disregards this treaty and frustrates the principle of open door, there is nothing to be done, as the United States cannot maintain it alone, nor may it be willing to maintain it jointly with other countries. However, the United States still relies on Britain's diplomatic assistance as the best way to prevent China from being slaughtered. This is why Secretary of State John Hay made the declaration to maintain China's open door. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) When British Foreign Secretary Simon answered a question from Labor Party member Clipper in the House of Commons on the 18th of this month regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, he stated that the Washington Nine-Power Treaty only stated that the signatory countries should respect China's political independence and territorial integrity, and there was no provision for maintaining China's independence and integrity by force. Recently, Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, issued a statement stating that Foreign Secretary Simon's words are only partially true. Because China is a member of the League of Nations, and the Treaty of Peace to which the League of Nations Covenant belongs, Britain is also one of the signatories. According to Article 10 of the Covenant, member states should not only respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other member states, but also have a joint obligation to maintain them and prevent foreign aggression.

<p>(Beiping) Northeast people who fled into the Customs after the September 18th Incident either did not dare to return to their hometowns to manage their property due to fear of the Japanese, or were not allowed. For years, everything has been in the hands of the Japanese. The Japanese, in order to win over certain figures, instructed relevant parties that, with the exception of the property of Zhang Xueliang and Feng Yong, which is absolutely confiscated, the remainder can be returned. Therefore, Cao and Lu, four key figures of a certain faction, who are currently residing in Tianjin, organized the Manchurian Industrial Trust Company in the Japanese concession of Tianjin to handle this matter. Since its establishment, it has been three months, and the commission has earned more than one million yuan. The method is to extract a commission of 200 yuan for every 10,000 yuan, and then the company pays a tax of 100 yuan to the puppet government. After hearing the news, Northeast people in the Customs have approached the company for assistance. It is said that most of the property of well-known Northeast people has been returned as requested. However, in the divorce case between Feng Yong and his wife Jiang Jintao, the judgment ordered Feng to pay Jiang over 500 hectares of land near the Beida Camp and several pawnshops. The puppet government has approved Jiang to receive them. In addition, due to the fact that Feng owned all the assets, they were priced and auctioned. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">National Financial Conference Opens <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— English Translation</p>
<p>The long-awaited National Financial Conference opened today in Nanjing. In addition to key officials from the Ministry of Finance and responsible officials for finance from various provinces and cities, many experts with social reputation are also participating. Bringing together the government and the public to discuss reforms to the national budget and offer strategies. Gathering ideas from various sources, how can it not be called a major event today? However, considering the current situation, we must urgently make great efforts. We still remember that the first National Financial Conference was convened in July of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928]. At that time, the National Government had overthrown the Northern Warlords and began a movement to rejuvenate the country with the people. Therefore, it intended to end the chaotic wartime finance and establish a national finance that develops production. Considering what the government publicized at that time and what the public opinion expressed, we could not help but think that the future was bright. However, time flies, and six years have passed. Now, we hear about the convening of the second conference. The purpose of the conference, besides streamlining tax revenue and adjusting expenditures, does not seem to include any further renewal plans. Today, various undertakings are riddled with problems. Even if the financial authorities are as diligent as Li Xian [a famous Tang Dynasty chancellor known for his diligence], they may still sigh that they have the will but lack the strength. This conference stems from the motivation to strive for prosperity and vigorously advance, which is acknowledged by the people of the country. However, whether it can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past cannot be determined by the conference itself. May I point out three of the biggest problems with our national finance? First, the unreasonable expansion of expenditures. According to the central budget expenditures, during the Beijing government era, it never exceeded 500 million yuan per year. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, expenditures expanded without limit, but the funding for production and construction has not increased. Taking the current year as an example, the budgeted expenditure has reached a huge sum of 828,921,964 yuan, and military spending alone accounts for 415,600,000 yuan. In addition, the actual expenditures not included in the report may be even more than this amount.</p>
<p>Second, the shrinking of regular revenue. Currently, the central government's revenue still relies heavily on customs and salt taxes. Customs and salt taxes are commodity taxes. Compared with the United States and the United Kingdom, where people's income tax is the main source of revenue, the advantages and disadvantages are vastly different. In recent years, commerce has been sluggish, and industry and commerce have declined. After the loss of the Northeast, the source of tax revenue has been greatly reduced. As a result, the central government's regular revenue has been severely hit. Attempts to cut spending have failed, and instead, efforts are being made to increase revenue. The issuance of public bonds has accumulated over time, and special tax revenue is not easy to quickly eliminate. Recently, former Finance Minister Song Ziwen, upon returning from the Northwest, said that special taxes "are difficult to replace, ultimately making it difficult to enforce the ban on opium." These are truly heartfelt words.</p>
<p>Third, the corruption of the tax system. Our country's tax system has been corrupt for a long time. The National Government has repeatedly regarded reforming the tax system as one of the key aspects of striving for prosperity. However, over the years, old taxes have not been reduced, and new levies have become increasingly dense. The central government's decrees are like mountains, while the local officials treat them like worn-out shoes. As a result, goods cannot circulate, and production cannot develop, all because of the corruption of the tax system. Our country failed to actively establish and implement a refreshing financial policy in the situation of the first financial conference, deeply regretting the missed opportunity. Now, the slump in commerce is even worse, and international aggression is even greater. Whether the above three problems will worsen or improve depends entirely on future efforts. I sincerely hope that all those attending the financial conference can identify these three issues as targets, formulate concrete and feasible remedial plans, and seek practical application rather than pleasing theoretical solutions. This will be fulfilling your duties to the fullest. As for whether it can be fully implemented, it depends on the determination and perseverance of those who implement it in the future.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota hosted a luncheon on the 19th for Ambassador to China Ariyoshi, who is returning to his post on the evening of the 23rd, as well as Vice Minister Shigemitsu, and Directors-General and Department Heads such as Kurasu, Togo, and Amau.

<p>(1) The Japanese government and China jointly assume responsibility for maintaining peace and promoting prosperity in East Asia, and reject all actions by third countries that interfere or use the name of cooperation with China to engage in political means.</p>
<p>(2) Resolving pending issues between China and Japan is a prerequisite for establishing Sino-Japanese friendship and establishing peace in East Asia. If China is sincere, Japan will not hesitate to provide any effort to help resolve pending issues.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese government will always provide well-intentioned guidance to China's requests, avoid local negotiations, and assist the Chinese government in order to restore its prosperity and unification. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(New York) According to the opinion of former Secretary of War Baker, if countries continue to compete in armaments, a second world war is inevitable. However, Baker also stated that if the United States cooperates with other countries to maintain international peace, it can still be salvaged. More than ten organizations promoting international peace have distributed petitions throughout the United States. Baker expressed his opinion on this, and the petition seeks national opinions on the United States formally joining the League of Nations. Baker's declaration stated, "There is no doubt that countries around the world are rapidly falling into an arms race. If this trend continues, a second tragic world war will be the inevitable result. Politicians can only say and do what their national public opinion and wishes dictate. Therefore, a formal collection of opinions, such as that initiated by the League of Nations Association, is essential. The League of Nations Association advocates that the United States declare the conditions for its accession to the League of Nations, so that the government of our country, representing a vast land and a large population, can fully understand the will of the people and act accordingly. The forces of law, justice, and peace throughout the world are now fighting against the forces of suspicion, fear, and aggression. Therefore, if the United States can express its cooperation as soon as possible, it may be able to avert the dangerous situation." (National News dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) A Washington dispatch from the London Observer states that the wave of calls for a European arms embargo has now sparked discussions in the United States regarding sanctions. The Senate previously held a position against sanctions, but months ago, President Roosevelt expressed his opinion that the United States should join European powers in supporting sanctions, and the Senate changed its attitude. Now, due to the arms embargo issue, sanctions discussions have been revived. Statistics on US Arms Exports to China The statistics on US arms exports have recently been released. Exports to China in the first three months of this year totaled US$1.1 million, mostly aircraft engines and parts. In addition, excellent American technicians, pilots, and powerful salesmen have gone to China. Therefore, those discussing arms embargoes are now paying attention to this statistic. It is expected that the Senate will handle this matter after research. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated today that the US government has consulted with major countries on the issue of an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay. Hull declared that the US has taken the lead in controlling the international arms trade, and is now awaiting the participation of other governments before taking further action. Hull hopes that other countries that have sold arms to Bolivia and Paraguay will be consistent in their words and actions and implement the highly touted arms embargo to achieve practical results. He is currently awaiting replies from various countries explaining their policies and intentions, paying more attention to the replies from countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. Hull currently does not want to announce which governments he has contacted or from which countries he has received replies. The government is also using a special Senate investigating committee to thoroughly investigate American arms companies, paying particular attention to international conspiracies among major companies to create war rumors and incite arms races. The first to be investigated are domestic arms manufacturers, bankers, merchants, chemical plants, and schemes and profiteering plots between aircraft and shipbuilding plants. Secondly, it will investigate in detail the collusion between these companies and major European arms dealers, and their activities in South America, China, and Japan. The scope of this investigation is as broad as the situation caused by the recent European espionage case. The Senate's secret investigators have been granted the power to act as appropriate, so that no suspected person, company, or organization is missed. These secret investigators will be busy collecting materials in the coming months and reporting to the Special Committee on Armaments. (National News dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The US Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to hold a joint meeting today to commemorate the centennial of the death of French General Lafayette, who helped the US achieve independence. Innumerable ceremonies have been held in major American cities this year to commemorate Lafayette, but the most solemn of these is the ceremony held by the Congress today, as President Roosevelt will personally attend and deliver a speech before the authorities of each state and the diplomatic community. French Ambassador de Laboulaye will also deliver a speech. President Lebrun sent a letter to the United States on behalf of the French people, expressing friendly respect to the American people and Congress. The letter stated that the relationship between the United States and France has roots in humanitarianism and will be everlasting. General Lafayette, who is jointly commemorated today, is not only French but also an American citizen. It concluded that the alliance between France and the United States is one of the main conditions for maintaining world peace, and that the two countries should adopt paths that love peace and respect personality in order to continue to seek progress and prosperity. Other important French figures, such as Foreign Minister Barthou, the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees of both houses, also took the opportunity to send telegrams to the speakers of the US Congress, promoting the friendship between the two countries for over a century, stating that whenever reason and justice are threatened, the two countries always unite to protect them.

France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, China, and Japan are all among those to whom telegrams were sent. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations took swift action today to prevent unnecessary sacrifices in the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay. The League of Nations today telegraphed 31 countries around the world requesting them to join the arms embargo against Bolivia and Paraguay. The United Kingdom and the United States are the major countries that manufacture and export arms and weapons, and they have now taken the lead in the embargo movement and believe that it will definitely succeed. It is a historic first for all countries to act in concert to stop the war. The United Kingdom advocated this action as early as November 1932, when it negotiated with various countries in order to realize a global arms embargo. In early 1933, the League of Nations formally exchanged views with various countries, and most countries expressed their willingness to take joint action, but only if the United States, France, Italy, and Germany agreed. At that time, the United States stated that it had no authority to implement it because it had not obtained congressional approval, which led to an interruption. President Roosevelt submitted a special message to Congress on Friday, requesting immediate approval of the 1925 Geneva Convention on the Supervision and Control of the International Arms Trade, which further called for the League of Nations to take further control. Senator Pittman's bill, which specifically authorizes the government to announce an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay, is expected to pass the Senate this week. (National News dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Brazilian Capital, Rio de Janeiro The dispute between Peru and Colombia over the Leticia border in South America has been mediated by Brazil and has now ended. Today, Brazilian Foreign Minister Franco claimed that the warring parties have now established an agreement to end hostilities based on the methods he proposed. It is heard that after the signing of this agreement, diplomatic relations between the two countries will be restored immediately. Leticia was ceded to Colombia six years ago, but Peruvians occupied it in September 1932, causing each side to refuse to yield, leading to war in February of the following year. The League of Nations tried to mediate last June, sending an American, a Brazilian, and a Spaniard as administrative commissioners of Leticia, but the final resolution was actually facilitated by Brazil.

<p>(Geneva) Regarding the Saar issue, the Administrative Council has decided to postpone the discussion until the extraordinary meeting on May 30. French Foreign Minister Barthou recently gave an interview to the French press, saying that the diplomatic negotiations this time were extremely difficult, and that some of the circumstances were contradictory. He could not tell them now, but he had always worked with a sincere spirit to ensure that France's attitude was in accordance with the peace treaty, and that France had interpreted the treaty in a fair and open manner, and that it sought to be accurate and unmistakable. He participated in the preparations for the Saar vote, and he never forgot this idea of peace. He had great faith in the efforts of the special committee on the Saar issue, and the Italian representative Alaya encouraged it with a fair attitude, which was especially unforgettable. He had made concessions on this issue, which seemed controversial, but there were still some points that he could never concede. He never retreated. For example, the date of the Saar vote could only be determined after the freedom of the voters and the safety of all residents were effectively guaranteed. He insisted on this throughout. If he had failed to demand guarantees of the freedom of voters and the safety of residents, and had proceeded to approve the date of the vote, he would have been not only a traitor to France, but also a criminal of the League of Nations, because the rights of both would have been harmed. Now that the Saar issue has been decided to be postponed for discussion, he should not say much more, because the special committee on the Saar issue is still continuing negotiations, and speaking too much may hinder the negotiations. Until the last moment, he still hoped that this meeting would be successful. Although he was unable to achieve his wish, the French delegation had nothing to hide. When the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvenes to discuss this matter, the French representatives will speak frankly about what they have seen, and the French will have no shame in the face of those in the world who are sincere and thoughtful.

<p>Sofia After the Bulgarian Prime Minister failed to organize a cabinet in the parliament, the parliament has been dissolved, and all political parties have suspended their activities. The military dictatorship was immediately established. This afternoon, Prime Minister Mushanov entered the palace to meet with King Boris to report on the failure of the organization. At the same time, the political situation took a sharp turn. King Boris ordered former Railway Minister Georgiev to form a cabinet, and at the same time gave the full power of the dictatorship to the King, and signed an edict dissolving Parliament. After receiving the order, Georgiev immediately engaged in the organization of the new cabinet. It is heard that there will be many military officers in it, such as General Vathev, who will be responsible for the Ministry of Military Affairs and Communications, and General Bogadiev, etc. Georgiev recently issued a declaration stating that the basis of the new government is the support of the army. Georgiev also announced to the people of the country that they should maintain order and wait quietly for results, and declared that the new government's foreign policy is to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries, and other domestic affairs, such as improving the economy, eradicating communism, and abolishing the party system, etc. Sofia is still under martial law, and major streets are guarded by heavy troops, and machine guns are erected in important locations.

<p>There have been rumors of troop movements in Bulgaria. It was not until last night that they were confirmed. Former Prime Minister Mushanov was ordered by King Boris to try to form a new cabinet, but after two days of negotiations, he resigned. Last night, the national army set out and occupied all the major strategic locations in the capital and provincial cities. The residences of former cabinet members were all guarded. Traffic in the city was completely blocked at 3:00 in the morning and entered a state of lockdown until noon. At 10:00 in the morning, King Boris signed three orders: (1) Former Prime Minister Mushanov did not need to handle routine affairs; (2) Georgiev was appointed as Prime Minister, temporarily serving as Foreign Minister; (3) Mitilev was appointed as Minister of the Interior, temporarily serving as Minister of Justice, and Todorov as Minister of Finance. It is estimated that the position of Foreign Minister will be held by Ambassador to France Batolov. In addition, the King signed an order merging the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Railways into the Ministry of Communications, and merging the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, Labor, and Agriculture into the Ministry of Economy. It is difficult to determine what attitude public opinion holds towards the coup, but it is credible that most people express sympathy for the new government. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>The new government issued a proclamation to the people of the country, explaining the reasons for the change of government, saying that the various political groups in the country were divided, and that disputes often arose between politicians and individuals. The party system of government has completely failed, and people are panicking. Administrative facilities have lost their normal state. Under these circumstances, a stable government could not be formed, and it was imperative to organize a "nationally united" government beyond political parties. In this state of national disintegration, only the army stood independently, embracing the ambition to stop the crisis and save the country. The new government was able to accomplish its transformation because of the power of the army.</p>

<p>The measures taken by the new government have been particularly noted by the newspapers. For example, the central agencies have been reduced from ten ministries to eight ministries, and the local areas have been reduced from sixteen provinces to seven provinces, and the towns have been reduced from 2,700 to 800, in order to save government expenses. The town and city councils are about to be dissolved, and the town chiefs and mayors will also serve as magistrates, all of whom will be appointed by the central government. According to reports, the future parliament will only have 100 members, of whom 75 will be appointed by the government, and the remaining 25 will be elected by professional groups. The old parliament had 274 members. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Reports of King Boris's assassination are completely unfounded. Military action began at two o'clock this morning. All public institutions have been occupied by military authorities, and crucial locations are heavily guarded by artillery and machine gun units. A notification was issued to shops and offices to cease work, so those going to work were turned back and pedestrian traffic was prohibited. Besides armed patrols, the streets were deserted. Prime Minister Muraviev was awakened early in the morning by his servant, who told him that the prime minister's residence was surrounded by troops. He urgently telephoned Minister of War Kissov, but a military officer answered, saying that private conversations were not allowed at this time. Muraviev said, "I am the Prime Minister." The officer replied, "You are not the Prime Minister." Then the phone line was cut. Other cabinet members who tried to make phone calls received the same response. Even the newly appointed cabinet members were quite surprised, as police officers went to their residences, urged them to get up, and took them to the police station. At first, everyone thought they had been arrested, but upon arriving at the police station, the police chief informed them that they had all been honorably appointed to the new government. After the troops occupied the capital, they simultaneously and strictly monitored incoming and outgoing communications. Even telephone calls from embassies required the approval of the authorities. When British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen left the embassy, he was escorted by a military officer. A Reuters reporter only managed to get to the British Embassy at noon. As of now, hundreds of left-wing party members and communists have been arrested. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The current cabinet's disciplinary problems have been fully exposed, causing great concern within the government. The cabinet's total resignation is certain, as a major incident involves not only Kuroda, the Vice Minister of Finance, but also Ohno Ryuta, the Chief of the Special Banks Section of the Banking Bureau, who was summoned by the prosecutor's office again this morning at seven o'clock. It is possible that this will affect important figures in the government, and the government's panic has reached an extreme level. Although they appear calm on the surface, they are secretly considering measures to deal with the aftermath. In particular, the responsibility of Finance Minister Takahashi for supervising his subordinates and Prime Minister Saito will become a problem. Before the regular cabinet meeting on the 22nd, the Prime Minister will summon the Finance Minister, the Interior Minister, and the Minister of Justice to hear about the situation and then discuss the government's course of action. Currently, the cabinet's total resignation is only a matter of time. However, considering that the Kuroda case is still under preliminary examination, they will temporarily observe the situation with caution, fully discuss measures to deal with the aftermath, and then carry out the total resignation.

<p>(Tokyo) With the formal indictment of Finance Vice Minister Kuroda Hideo yesterday, Finance Minister Takahashi feels the greatest responsibility. Political circles expect Takahashi to resign to take responsibility, but his resignation is bound to trigger a violent movement to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, the resignation will have to take the form of a total resignation of all cabinet members. Finance Minister Takahashi is most concerned about this point. Although today is Sunday, the heads of the government are in frequent contact to find a good way to deal with the situation. (China United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kuroda Vice Minister issue has affected Ohno, the Chief of the Banking Section, and Aida, the administrator, and it is becoming increasingly urgent that it will reach Okubo, the Director of the Banking Bureau. The Ministry of Finance and the government are experiencing a major shock, and Finance Minister Takahashi's decision to advance or retreat is being given more attention, putting the political situation in crisis.

This morning at nine o'clock, they summoned Aida Iwao, the former Prime Minister Hamaguchi's son-in-law, who is the supervisor of the Taiwan Bank and the Korea Bank of the Ministry of Finance. At 9:10, they summoned Shito Motojiro, a supplementary bank inspector, investigated by Kuroda. The Director of the Banking Bureau, Okubo Teiji, himself feels in danger. Ohno, the Chief of the Special Banks Section, is the son-in-law of the former Minister of Justice, Hara Yoshimichi, and has a relationship with the 囗囗 problem under the order of Kuroda, the Vice Minister. Therefore, both Aida and Shito are suspected of taking bribes. (Dentsu dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Although the military is not entirely satisfied with the Saito Cabinet, they still consider it to have a compliant nature that listens to military orders. In this era of difficult childbirth for the next cabinet, they are still willing to support the current cabinet. However, since Elder Statesman Saionji came to Tokyo, he has been striving to restore constitutional government and suppress Hirayama, the Vice President of the Privy Council from the military faction, which has caused great indignation. Moreover, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties recognize that it is not yet time to restore party politics and are planning to recommend General Ugaki, the Governor-General of Korea, as the next Prime Minister. Ugaki is determined to come to Tokyo on the 27th or 28th of this month to campaign. Ugaki is the most feared by the current military. Therefore, the military believes that if the Saito Cabinet carries out a total resignation, it will inevitably be taken advantage of by the political parties and the Ugaki faction, which is causing great concern. Therefore, they may plan to maintain the current cabinet. The corruption case of Finance Vice Minister Kuroda has actually stirred up disputes among various factions in the Japanese political and military circles, and its trend deserves the most attention.

(2) He met with Minister of the Imperial Household Makino and Prime Minister Saito to have Ichiki Kitokuro, a supporter of constitutionalism, appointed as the President of the Privy Council, suppressing Vice President Hirayama. (3) In preparation for his death, he agreed that Privy Council President Ichiki and Minister of the Imperial Household Makino would act as Elder Statesman to assist the Emperor.

<p>Bombing Case Near Vienna</p>
<h3 id="e37">Twelve Incidents in One Day; Retaliatory Acts by the Nazi Party; Military Police Deployed; Bombers All Escape <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>This morning, more than a dozen locations on the national railways and power lines throughout Austria were bombed simultaneously, and all of the perpetrators escaped without being caught. It is widely believed that these are retaliatory acts by the Nazi Party against the current government, and that they were carefully planned. Throughout the day, the Ministry of Public Security has made every effort to obtain the perpetrators with the assistance of the military police, but so far has achieved nothing. Among these twelve bombing incidents, three occurred in the suburbs of the capital. After several railway bridges were bombed, only broken rails remained suspended in the air. In Salzburg, two huge power poles were also blown up, plunging the entire city into darkness. There are six other bombing incidents that have been formally reported here, and there are several other cases of bombs being discovered but not detonated along railways in various places. The government has offered a reward to apprehend the main culprits in this case, and reports of bombings are still coming in. For example, this afternoon, three more locations on the tracks between Gamisch Partenkirchen and Innsbruck were bombed, resulting in very heavy losses. According to statistics, among the cases that have been reported today, all lines connecting the capital, except for the Franz Josef line, have been affected. (National Press dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Chicago: The Chicago Union Stockyards were careless today, and the fire spread extremely quickly. Within an hour, the entire area of one square mile was surrounded by flames. Before long, the fire spread to a hotel and two banks, and fanned by a strong wind, it threatened to move towards the northwest residential area. The people, seeing their houses in danger, were indescribably panicked. There were also several thousand spectators, and the police widely deployed sentry lines to prevent looting. Firefighters from within several miles rushed to help put out the fire. Seeing the dryness of the water, residents also organized water-carrying teams to fetch water from a distance to help. However, the fire continued to burn for several hours before it could be contained. The firefighters tried various methods to stop the spread of the fire. The fire was aided by the strength of the wind and was unstoppable. Therefore, they tried to place explosives at key points to reduce the fire's intensity. In this disaster, in addition to destroying several houses, several ammonia warehouses and oil pools were also destroyed. It is currently believed that twenty people were injured, including one police officer, and the losses exceed ten million dollars. It is truly a major disaster for Chicago. It is also said that the telephone operators at the stockyards did not leave their posts until the flames reached their switchboards and the telephone lines were burned. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Chicago: It is now believed that the cause of the fire is the same as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, caused by someone unintentionally throwing an unextinguished cigarette butt into a bale of hay in a stable. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Chicago: It is estimated that the total loss from the fire reaches ten million dollars, including the destruction of fifteen large buildings, many residences, countless cattle and sheep sheds, warehouses, etc. Empty cars and freight-loaded vehicles were also affected. There is no definite report on the loss of livestock. A portion of the elevated railway line was also burned, leaving only a few steel pillars. The remaining houses are only great skeletons of steel, but still remain. Nearly three thousand people assisted the firefighters in fighting the blaze. All buildings within a radius of three kilometers were affected by the disaster. According to records, the slaughterhouse burned down employs a number of personnel equal to one-sixth of the entire population of Chicago, occupying an area of three square kilometers. The livestock sold and slaughtered there amounts to 15 million head per year. Now, the slaughtering machinery in the slaughterhouse has also been completely burned. According to an airmail pilot, he saw the flames soaring straight into the clouds, reaching a height of 1,200 meters, from the sky 120 kilometers away from Chicago. He thought that the entire city of Chicago was on fire. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The opening ceremony of the Third Iron Exhibition was held at the Taimiao at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Qian Zongze, Yu Yan, Zheng Baozhao, Zheng Daobao, Ge Guangting, He Yingqin, Yuan Liang, Wang Shuchang, Belgian Envoy Ji Youmu, and guests from all walks of life, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Qian Zongze, as chairman, reported on the significance of the Iron Exhibition, stating that the purpose of this event is to spread culture, support the development of national industry and commerce, enable society to understand the functions of railways, promote industry, regulate the economy, strive to promote production, increase national strength, and revive our Chinese nation. He hopes that the people of the whole country will guide and assist to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort. Next, Yu Yan reported on the preparations and the reform of railway administration. He Yingqin then gave a speech, stating that China was originally a country with backward production. In recent years, it has been plagued by Red bandits and the international situation is dangerous. Rural bankruptcies and industrial and commercial decline occur everywhere, and all construction cannot be carried out. Therefore, the central government has decided on a major plan to save the nation and survive, striving to suppress the Red bandits and promote production and construction. The opening of the Iron Exhibition at this time is of profound significance, as it can statistically analyze railway products across the country to provide opportunities for improvement. At the same time, material development, knowledge exchange, national assimilation, and military speed are all closely related to transportation. If transportation is inconvenient and transportation is hindered, the country and the people will suffer countless losses. While promoting production, we must strive for construction, hoping that everyone will follow the Premier's industrial plan, accelerate the completion of several main lines running through the country, and hope that future iron exhibitions will spread throughout the country, so that various productions will develop accordingly, and achieve the goal of prosperity and strength. Finally, Yuan Liang, Wang Shuchang, and others gave speeches one after another. The meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock. After the ceremony, guests were invited to visit the exhibition hall. The Beining and Pinghan Pavilions were the most neatly arranged, except for the Specialty Pavilion. The Pinghan Pavilion also made a model train that actually ran in the hall, which was especially praised by the guests. The exhibition officially opened on the 20th. For the sake of popularization, no tickets will be charged for the first three days, and admission is free. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Industry, the plan to establish a newspaper manufacturing factory was originally intended to be a joint official-commercial venture with major newspaper offices and bookstores in Shanghai. However, due to the January 28th Incident, the commercial parties had insufficient funds, so it was suspended. Since the demand for newspaper materials is very high in the country, after the nationalized ammonium sulfate factory was turned over to commercial operation, the 255,000 pounds of British Boxer Indemnity loan originally used to establish the ammonium sulfate factory, along with the 88,750 pounds of British Boxer Indemnity surplus due to the Ministry of Industry, totaling about 4.84 million national currency, will be used as the foundation for the newspaper factory. Four million yuan in public bonds will be issued, and the factory will be operated independently by the government. The Ministry's proposal and plan have been approved by the Administrative Yuan. The distribution of the factory's capital of 4.1 million yuan is planned as follows: 1.9 million for pulp and papermaking machinery, 1.9 million for hydroelectric power plants, and 300,000 for base buildings. The plan has now been sent to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board for review. The board of directors is expected to approve it on the 28th of this month. This paper factory can produce about 35 tons of newspaper per day. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Kailian, the Director of Finance of Hunan Province, arrived in Nanjing. It is said that Hunan Province has always been financially poor. Although it has been reorganized over the years, it still cannot make ends meet. Therefore, the living expenses of public officials are still paid at a discount. However, construction projects have not been stopped due to lack of funds. At present, the progress of Hunan's highways is very rapid and can be called well-connected in all directions. The highway from Changsha to Nanchang will also be completed next month and will be open to traffic directly. There is also good news: After Mr. Tang invented the charcoal car, its structure was not as flexible as a gasoline car, so he further researched it. Now he has invented the use of alcohol instead of gasoline. After testing, the combustion power is no different from gasoline, and the price of alcohol needed per hour is cheaper than gasoline. The provincial government is currently planning to build a small-scale alcohol factory with a capital of 300,000 yuan. It is expected to be completed in the second half of the year. The raw materials for alcohol production are red potatoes and sorghum produced in Hunan Province. Once the alcohol factory is successful, all cars running on highways in Hunan Province will be converted to use alcohol, which can save a lot of money every year. (20th special telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Ping Shen Through Train Problem <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yin Tong Talks About the Process of Negotiating the Through Train</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, published a speech after returning to Beiping, summarizing the process of the Yuguan Conference: After the Tanggu Armistice Agreement was signed on May 31 last year, the things we gradually resolved were the counties in the Luan Yu Ji Mi war zone and the reception of various ports of the Great Wall, the reorganization of the security team in the war zone, etc., which were all successfully concluded. The most difficult problem was the through train problem on the Tang Yu section of the Beining Railway. After extreme negotiations, the through train on the Tang Yu section was finally realized on August 13, and we were able to avoid direct relations with the puppet organization. At this time, the Japanese asked for a through train to Ping Shen. Due to various relations, we allowed them to talk about it again two months later. I took office as Director of the Beining Railway Bureau on October 27 last year. At that time, it was two months after the through train on the Tang Yu section. The documents requesting negotiations on the through train from the Japanese had been piled up on my desk. After I took office, I discussed this matter at the first bureau affairs meeting. At the same time, I had a meeting with specialized personnel in the bureau and drafted several plans, which I personally sent to the central government for reference. But the central government suddenly denied the through train negotiations in December last year, so we could not talk about it anymore. It is rumored that I discussed the through train matter in Yu this time. Without a clear order from the central government, why should I automatically do this? Moreover, my visit to Yu and meeting with various people was a chance encounter. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Notorious Bandit in Southern Fujian, Lin Jing, Executed by Firing Squad in Quanzhou - Five Members of Lin's Group Executed at the Same Time - <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: Lin Jing, a notorious bandit in Xianyou, was previously incorporated into the 7th Regiment of the Security Team. He擅自移防仙遊 and had extorted money from the people. Song Xiqian, commander of the 36th Division and garrison commander of Quanzhou, disarmed Lin's troops in Putian on April 17, arrested 33 officers from Lin and below and sent them to Quanzhou. The people of Xianyou and Putian accused them of being victimized. The Party Department and Chamber of Commerce of Xianyou, Putian, and Jinjiang sent telegrams requesting that they be executed on the spot. Later, the provincial government ordered them to be sent to the province for interrogation. The people of Xingquan still insisted on execution on the spot. Song Xiqian returned to Quanzhou from Xiamen on the 7th and sent a telegram to the provincial government, saying that the people were angry and asked for permission to execute them on the spot. The special Party Department of the 36th Division also sent a telegram to the province requesting that it comply with public opinion. At the same time, various community organizations in Xingquan sent telegrams to the province, saying that Lin Jing had been harming Putian and Xianyou for ten years. Hearing that his gang was active in the province, they asked Commander Song to execute him on the spot to appease public anger and stop rumors. Therefore, the provincial government telegraphed the Quanzhou Garrison Command on the 12th, ordering Lin Jing and five of his gang to be executed by firing squad in Quanzhou. After receiving the telegram, Song Xiqian brought out Lin and his battalion commander Yang Da, company commander Yang Keng, Lin De, Lin Ying, and adjutant Fu Zixiong at 9:30 am on the 13th and tied them to Zhongshan Park for execution. When Lin was brought out, he still thought he was being sent to the province. When he saw the troops lined up and the executioner interrogated him, his face changed. He still pleaded with the executioner to convey his request to the division commander to give him a few more days, saying that someone outside was guaranteeing him. He pleaded several times and was finally pushed to the execution ground, where he died immediately after being hit by four bullets. The other five people also died together. Lin Chunmeng, the Xianyou Party Committee, was shot and killed by Lin this spring. His wife Huang Qingxia went to the execution ground to watch the execution. After the execution, the Quanzhou Garrison Command announced that "the case investigated that Lin Jing, Yang Da, Yang Keng, Lin De, Lin Ying, and adjutant Fu Zixiong (all from Xianyou), the commanders of the 7th Security Regiment, had been harming Putian and Xianyou for more than ten years, committing adultery, looting, arson, and murder, doing everything they could. The people cried and swallowed their voices. Last time, the provincial government approved the reorganization, originally hoping that they would repent and start anew. However, since the reorganization, the regiment commander and others have continued to do evil and abuse the good, adding to the harm. There must be several complaints or accusations from the people in all directions who come to the headquarters every day. In view of their crimes, it is impossible to record them all. In order to eliminate violence and maintain peace, the headquarters dispatched a team to disarm them and reported the situation to the Fujian Provincial Government for Chen and he. Now we have received a telegram authorizing execution on the spot to show vigilance, and we should comply. In addition to signing and sending the criminals to the execution ground for execution, we should announce it to the public." According to reports, Lin Jing is 34 years old this year and is from Dayun Village, Xianyou. He came from the green forest and was accepted as the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Marine Corps. In 1919, he rebelled in Xianyou, and his firearms increased to more than 2,000 guns. Later, he was accepted as the 2nd Detachment of the Provincial Defense Army and transferred to Fuqing. Because of the harsh taxes, it caused a civil revolt. Thousands of people died in Fuqing, and 500 of Lin's troops also died. The provincial government ordered the suppression. In 1921, the Communist bandits captured Zhangzhou. Lin was reorganized by the navy as the 1st Detachment of the Suppression Red Army and stationed in Dongshan. Later, it was resolved by the 49th Division. Lin returned to Xianyou. During the 19th Route Army, Lin was accepted as the 4th Detachment of the People's Self-Defense Army, with more than 2,000 people. Later, it was reorganized as the 7th Security Regiment, with a thousand and three hundred guns in a response point. Then it was disarmed and arrested. Chen Guohui, a bandit in southern Fujian, belonged to Quanyong, and Lin belonged to Putian and Xianyou, both of whom were the only giants. (May 17)</p>

<p>Wuyuan Communication: Since Fang Shao's Red Communist bandits, who were based in the Xinjiang River basin of Eastern Jiangxi, were heavily encircled by the Central Army, they have repeatedly conquered the key passes of the bandits. The Red Communist bandits suffered heavy losses, and with the loss of all geographical advantages, they had no danger to rely on. The internal appearance suddenly showed panic, and the army could not be formed. The 囗囗 and two divisions are now advancing to Henfeng Aluminum Mountain to encircle and capture, in order to take advantage of the victory to annihilate them. The two troops of the marching camp are fighting in the Shangrao area, and the advance is even more fierce, and the number of bandits killed is even greater. The forced people in the bandit area and the coerced bandits without military training have all taken the opportunity to escape danger and start anew, and they have left the bandits and surrendered. The momentum is gradually disappearing. Recently, the main force of the false 10th Army, due to the step-by-step pressure of various armies,窜至德兴暖水葛源附近, hoping to invade the border between Zhejiang and Anhui. According to the military intelligence of Leping, the bandits in southern Germany are currently attempting to harass and resist our army's advancement in three routes. The false 10th Army is in the middle road, in the Fenghuangling · Jietianqiao · Lianhuatang false 11th Army in the left and right two roads, the left road is in the Yangbo · Majia · area, the right road is in Chongxi · Rao Erdun · area, which is currently surrounded by the armies of Zhejiang and Anhui in layers. The 囗 division has advanced from Tongbu Ducun to conquer the new Hengde Xing, and the 囗 brigade is advancing behind. The bandits have no power to resist. There are occasional scattered bandits who take the opportunity to invade and 窜, no less than throwing themselves into the net, which is easier to achieve the effect of annihilation. According to a guest from Shangrao, the Red Communist bandits in the Guangxin Aluminum Mountain Guangfeng area have suffered most of their strength after being painfully suppressed by various armies. The supplies in the bandit area are strictly blocked by the national army and cannot be obtained anywhere. They feel very difficult. They will be completely eliminated soon. The local military and political authorities have set up several reception centers to recruit refugees. All people who escape from the bandit area, the young and strong are given food for ten days and then given agricultural and industrial jobs. The old and young who are unable to work are given half a liter of rice per day to support their lives. At the same time, Yushan has a Qingxiang Post-Disaster Committee to handle the soothing and editing of refugees, setting up editing, soothing, construction, and financial groups, and organizing a bandit suppression propaganda team with various agencies. The work is quite hard. Wherever the bandit suppression armies go, they try to rescue the people in the bandit area, so the people welcome the national army with all their heart. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Expected Bumper Harvest for Suzhou and Wuxi Silkworms <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Favorable Climate Leads to Excellent Development</p>
<p>Silkworm Seeds to be Under Unified Control This Autumn</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The two counties of Suzhou and Wuxi, situated near Taihu Lake, possess abundant mulberry fields and a renowned silk industry. Furthermore, with the early improvement of rearing methods and the excellent quality of cocoons, the silk industry has been steadily growing. However, it has been affected by the recent decline in silk prices and the bankruptcy of rural villages, leading to a gradual decrease in the number of silkworm farmers. Currently, the Department of Construction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces has established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Improvement Management Association to implement unified control, improve silkworm breeds, and compel farmers to purchase them in order to seek relief. This spring, the cold weather greatly affected silkworm farming, but fortunately, the county's silkworm rearing was delayed. The weather has now turned favorably warm, and the silkworms are developing well. Most of them have already passed their third molt and are developing excellently. In a week, they will be ready to spin cocoons. A bumper harvest of cocoons is expected this summer. Yesterday, our reporter investigated the situation from various sources, as follows:</p>
<p>The silkworm area in Wuxian County is roughly divided into four districts: (1) Guangfu, (2) Mudu, (3) the East and West Mountains of Dongting, and (4) Xiangshan. Among these, except for the Mudu district, which still adheres to traditional methods and does not know how to improve, the rest have purchased improved silkworm breeds and adopted new rearing methods. In the Guangfu district, the Wuxian County Agricultural Extension Office has established a guidance center to teach farmers how to raise silkworms, which has been going on for six or seven years and has achieved good results. This spring's silkworm farming is also going smoothly. However, in the Guangfu Shanzhen Bridge area, guided by the Suzhou Agricultural School, many of the early-hatched silkworms have died due to the weather's impact. The late-hatched ones are still in their first molt and should not experience any further mishaps. Few farmers in Dongting East Mountain raise silkworms, while West Mountain remains prosperous. The improved silkworm breeds in that area, especially the Pagoda and Tiger brands, account for the absolute majority. The rearing process is also good. Xiangshan is an industrial area, and silkworm farming is the main agricultural activity. In the autumn of the year before last, the Fengxi Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant invested in opening a guidance center to teach farmers to adopt new silkworm rearing methods. After three years of efforts and improvement, the number of silkworm farmers adopting new methods has increased from fifty or sixty households to more than a thousand. The annual cocoon yield has increased, and the quality has also improved. This spring's silkworm farming has been developing exceptionally well, with great prospects for a bumper harvest. The native silkworm breeds have mostly died and have gradually disappeared in recent years. Wuxi has always been the largest market for silkworm seeds. In previous years, the annual silkworm sales could reach 600,000 sheets of improved seeds. This spring, due to the increasing bankruptcy of farmers' economies and weak purchasing power, only 400,000 sheets were sold. The county's guidance center is hosted by the Shanxian County Agricultural Farm. This spring, the Huaxin Silk Factory has also invested in establishing a large-scale guidance center to teach silkworm farmers. Currently, the early-hatched silkworms have passed the 3rd molt, and the late-hatched ones are still in their first molt. They are developing well, and a good harvest is expected.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Silkworm Seed Unified Control Regulation has been decided by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Improvement Management Conference and will be implemented this autumn. Model areas and non-model areas will be designated. In the model areas, cocoon merchants will deduct twelve yuan per load when collecting cocoons to purchase silkworm seeds and force farmers to raise improved silkworm breeds. In non-model areas, public sales offices will be established to facilitate farmers' purchase. The association has now designated Wuxi County and the East and West Mountains of Dongting in Wuxian County as model areas and will soon establish silkworm seed public sales offices in Hushu Pass, Guangfu, Hengjing, and Xiangshan.

<h3 id="e103">An Impressionistic Record of Economic Survey in Guangxi Province (Continued) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>However, can this kind of rural lending really liberate farmers from the clutches of usury? Here, I record what Mr. Gao Yuanxun, who presides over the farmers' lending in this district, said to us: "The effect of this lending in rural areas is minimal. Farmers still seek help from usury and are still trapped under the high degree of exploitation by merchant capital. Because there are too many poor people here, a mere thirty or fifty thousand yuan is really a drop in the bucket and of no help. According to our estimates, the farmers' debt in this area amounts to 300,000 yuan. To help them, at least 500,000 yuan is needed to truly eliminate the exploitation of usurious capital. In fact, usury is not the main problem. The most frightening thing is the manipulation of agricultural product prices by merchants. For example, there is a collection and storage shop called Guangxinglong. When there is a spring famine, they lend peanut cakes or grain to farmers, agreeing to return sugar cane in the future. These peanut cakes are worth only two or three yuan, but they lend them out at the highest price of eight or nine yuan, with a monthly interest rate of three percent. When the farmers harvest the sugar cane, they are burdened with debt and have to take it to the sugar pressing shops, which are also opened by Guangxinglong. Thus, they can collect exorbitant fees. Of course, they can get some cheap sugar. After the sugar is pressed, the company that collects the sugar is also them. At this time, they can immediately suppress the sugar price very low. For example, the sugar in Liuzhou, when the price is high (between August and September), can be sold for thirteen or fourteen yuan per load. However, when the sugar is produced (October to December), it can only be sold for five or six yuan. Through this kind of exploitation, the rural areas are becoming poorer day by day, and the merchants or landlords are becoming richer. Now, 90 percent of those who borrow money from us are tenant farmers. These tenant farmers have all gone bankrupt from being self-sufficient farmers."</p>
<p>Mr. Gao's words deserve our deep attention because the exploitation of farmers by merchant capital is not unique to Liuzhou, but is the same throughout China. And the difficulty of achieving practical results due to the lack of funds for rural lending is not only the difficulty felt by the Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Area, but also the difficulty felt by all of China's so-called farmers' banks, credit lending cooperatives. The total population of the pilot area is only 40,000, and the debt amount has reached more than 300,000 yuan. Then, the debt amount of Guangxi's 12 million people should be at least 100 million yuan. Can such a serious rural financial problem be solved by relying solely on credit lending? Perhaps this is worth our reflection.</p>
<p>In addition to agricultural and forestry institutions, Liuzhou is also a pilot area for Guangxi's provincial-run factories. The three new industries in Guizhou Province in recent years—sulfuric acid plant, alcohol plant, and mechanical plant—except for the sulfuric acid plant located in Wuzhou, the rest are located in Jila (about ten miles from the city) in Liuzhou. Sulfuric acid and alcohol are both basic chemical industries in modern times, and the importance of mechanical plants is even more well known. Therefore, on our last day in Liuzhou, we went to visit them.</p>
<p>The planning of the alcohol plant originally started in the 16th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the authorities of Guizhou Province were determined to open up highways and were therefore concerned about the consumption of automobile fuel. They thought that alcohol could be used as a substitute for gasoline, so they prepared for the Guangxi Alcohol Plant. Later, due to financial constraints, progress was slow. After the military uprising in the 18th year, the political situation was chaotic, and everything was completely stalled. It was not until the 20th year of the Republic of China, after the cooperation between Guangdong and Guangxi, that they continued to start. In June of the 21st year, it officially started production. The factory works eight hours a day, producing about 800 catties of alcohol. After three days, it is distilled once, yielding 1,400 catties of 98-degree alcohol. The raw material for alcohol is temporarily using tangerine water, which is the distilled water after sugarcane is pressed for sugar. These are all local products of Liuzhou. Now, merchants from all over know that the alcohol plant needs tangerine water and have inventory. They bring the goods to the factory to test the quality and then negotiate the price, pay a deposit, and transport it back to the factory for storage on schedule. However, because the supply of tangerine water is limited and the cost is too expensive, it now costs seven dimes per catty of alcohol to make. Adding the consolidated tax, transportation costs, etc., it costs about four dimes to transport to Guangzhou, and the selling price in Guangzhou is only this amount. It is said that they also know that the cost of using tangerine water is expensive, but because the authorities were concerned at the beginning not about the cost, but about whether the machine is suitable or not, whether the product is good after starting, and whether there is a market. So they temporarily used tangerine water to test. Their original plan was to use miscellaneous grains, so the factory site was not set in Wuzhou, where transportation is convenient and the land is in the center, but in Liuzhou, where the land is vast and the miscellaneous grains are abundant. They are now planning to make alcohol from miscellaneous grains. The residue left over from making alcohol from miscellaneous grains is used to feed livestock, and the livestock is sold to exchange for miscellaneous grains. The two expenditures are just offset, so the cost of raw materials can be completely saved. Now, 90 percent of the products of the Liuzhou Alcohol Plant are sold to Guangzhou. We firmly believe that if the alcohol industry can develop, it will not only be enough to resist a part of Guizhou Province's leak, but also one of the most promising national industries in our country. However, after visiting the Liuzhou Alcohol Plant, there is something that we think is not perfect, that is, after the factory was changed to the Industry and Commerce Bureau (formerly under the Construction Department, after March of the 10th year, it belonged to the Industry and Commerce Bureau), Director Yang Zhuo also merged their accounting into the Industry and Commerce Bureau, so that not only the cost of alcohol, how the sales are, and what the selling price is, the people in the factory are completely inexplicable. Even when we asked whether the factory has been making money or losing money recently and how the profits and losses are, from the factory director to the accounting director, they all stared blankly and didn't know how to answer. On the one hand, this is a manifestation of Mr. Yang's responsible spirit, but a factory without independent accounting is something we ultimately think is not good.</p>

<p>Yang Letian, a resident of this county, used the means of a Jianghu quack to defraud Bao Ruxun and others of a large sum of money in Shanghai. After Bao reported to the police, Yang was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. Bao also hired lawyer Ye Fokang to handle the legal procedures for this case. Last month, Yang was sentenced to two years and six months in prison. Regarding the part of the private lawsuit for the return of the defrauded money, the plaintiff recently found that Yang had a house in Jiangxiqiao Town, his hometown. On the previous day, it was approved by the Special Court to send a document to Wuxi. The local branch court sent an executive officer to Jiangxiqiao to seal the house for auction. However, it is heard that the house does not belong to Yang Letian but to his brother Yang Zhongshan. An objection has already been raised.</p>

Detective Team Leader Ni Gusheng led detectives to various places to investigate secretly. According to recent reports, the murderers in this case traveled between Shanghai and Taixing. On the 18th, they took a midnight train to Changzhou. Team Leader Ni and others guarded near the North Gate all night. On the morning of the 19th, they arrested four bandits, Zhu Zhilin, Gao Xida, Zhu Mao, and Gao Wang, in two places, Dashutou Shuangxianli. They also seized multiple pieces of ammunition, stolen goods, and clothing. They were taken to the county government for interrogation. They confessed that they were instigated by Qiu Yifeng (Qiu is the director of the slaughter tax, who was repeatedly accused by Yu Canrong, and the case has not yet been concluded) and promised to give them 200 yuan. Gao Wang (who had an affair with Qiu) and Gao Xida hired Zhu Zhilin and others to come to Changzhou to assassinate. The county government obtained the confession and sent the police to arrest Qiu Yifeng. However, Qiu had heard the news and fled, so he could not be arrested. However, the truth is revealed, and everyone is relieved.</p>

<p>Zhang Bin, the captain of the Sixth Police Team of Jiangdu, reported that Wang Jiayuan and others, residents of Sujiazuikou Village, robbed cultivated cattle. The police officer Dai Chengfa and others were ordered to arrest them. They were attacked by Wang Jiayuan's father, Wang Yingkuan, who gathered people to assault the police and seize weapons. It is now learned that the police officers Jin Wen and Liu Guangxi, who were taken away by the gang, fled back to the team in a panic on the evening of the 18th, claiming that the box cannons and rifles they were carrying had been taken away. The report was immediately sent to the police brigade headquarters and forwarded to the county government. County Magistrate Ma immediately summoned Wang Yongnian and Wang Yingkuan, who were in custody, for interrogation. The injured policeman Dai Chengfa also came to court to confront them and confirm the facts. According to Wang Yingkuan's confession, Wang owed 20 yuan for membership fees and took the cow as collateral, which was not robbery. The assault on the police and seizure of weapons was due to a misunderstanding at night that the police team was a bandit and did not dare to resist arrest. The seized guns and cannons had been handed over to the village head Li Deyi, but their whereabouts were unknown. It was ordered that Wang Yingkuan be shackled and sent to prison, and Wang Yongnian be sent to the police detective team for custody, pending investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Origin and Preparatory Situation of Convening the National Financial Conference The Ministry previously received <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>an order from the Executive Yuan in the 149th Executive Yuan meeting to reduce the additional tax on cultivated land and abolish miscellaneous taxes and levies. The implementation measures were telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance, and it was ordered to be noted, along with copies of the implementation measures. It was found that item three of the original document stipulated that the Ministry of Finance should convene representatives from the provincial and municipal financial authorities and economic circles in Beijing in June of this year for a meeting. The Ministry of Finance should comply with this. Preparatory committee members were appointed on March 26 to engage in preparations. However, the issues to be discussed at the meeting, such as reducing the additional tax on cultivated land and abolishing miscellaneous taxes and levies, are all related to local budgets. The start of the 23rd year is approaching, so the date of the meeting was slightly advanced to May 21 of this year. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting and approved for advance. Immediately, five types of conference regulations were formulated. Based on these regulations, relevant ministries, committees, and offices, as well as provincial and municipal governments, were consulted to recommend representatives, and the directors of the provincial and municipal finance departments and the directors of the municipal finance bureaus were asked to attend the meeting in Beijing. The proposals, reports, and plans should be sent to the Ministry ten days before the conference for collation. Experts were also selected and hired to attend the meeting for joint discussion. The internal and external personnel of the Ministry of Finance who should attend the meeting were also designated separately. Subsequently, on April 11, Qin Fen, the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry, was appointed as the Secretary-General of the conference, and personnel were selected to organize the Secretariat to start work. The published regulations, the members of the conference preparatory committee, and the titles of the important officials of the Secretariat are listed below.</p>

The conference is scheduled to open this morning at 9:00 AM in the capital. Financial authorities from various provinces and cities have arrived in Nanjing one after another to report in. Mr. Kong considers the conference to be of great importance to the future national finances, so he took a plane to Nanjing at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Cai Zengji, director of the local finance bureau, and others also arrived in Nanjing last night to attend the conference.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways yesterday issued instructions to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, stating that the National Financial Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance is about to open, and the Ministry of Railways will also send personnel to attend. This is an opportune time to propose the abolition of existing improper and excessive levies and miscellaneous taxes on railways nationwide in order to reduce the burden on merchants and civilians. All freight on each railway, in addition to freight charges, all other taxes of any nature, should be urgently reported by telegraph, including the name of the tax and the general tax rate, and then continue to submit detailed reports. It is essential to handle this matter conscientiously. After receiving this order, the railway bureaus immediately ordered their subordinates to investigate and report.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Rent Dispute in Xicheng Lane: Mediation with Representatives of Both Sides Convened Yesterday, Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily Soon <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Xicheng Lane on Ximen Road and Malan Road in the French Concession has more than 140 houses. Since the landlord Sun Chuanfang took back the houses and managed them himself, he organized the Yiyuan Company to inform all tenants that they must uniformly renew their contracts and are not allowed to be in arrears with their rent. Staff are sent daily to collect and extort payments. The content of the contract is entirely one-sided, and other examples are particularly harsh. It stipulates that the rent must be paid in full by the fifth of each month, otherwise they will be ordered to vacate the house. The intention is nothing more than to make the old tenants unable to live, so that new tenants can be replaced, and huge small rents can be collected, or it is beautifully called deposit rent. In addition to three months, an additional 3 yuan per room will be charged for tap water. Subletting by three tenants is also restricted, which has aroused the resentment of all tenants and caused disputes that have lasted for many days. The current tenants, in addition to hiring lawyer Wu Kaisheng to protect their rights and interests in accordance with the law, have submitted the landlord's illegal and coercive contract to the Shanghai Committee for Reviewing Rent Disputes, requesting verification. The committee convened representatives of both sides to a meeting at the Fenglinqiao Association at 3:00 PM yesterday to mediate the dispute. Tenants' representatives Yao Xingyuan, Gu Mingjia, Weng Jixiang, Zhang Xingren, and Jiang Zhenfang, as well as landlord's representative lawyer Wu Zhenming, attended on time. Chen Lengseng, director of the Committee for Reviewing Rent Disputes, interviewed the representatives of both sides separately and then ordered the representatives of both sides to talk on the spot. The focus of the dispute was on the articles of the contract. In addition, regarding the harassment by rent collectors, Mr. Chen advised both parties that since the tenants had hired lawyer Wu to handle the matter, each tenant should raise opinions or make improvements to any unfavorable conditions in the contract and submit them to lawyer Wu together. Lawyer Wu would then schedule a negotiation with landlord's representative lawyer Wu to resolve the matter. The tenants could also request the landlord to replace the harassing rent collectors. At that time, there were no objections to this method, so it was decided to proceed in accordance with this principle to resolve the matter as soon as possible, and the results would be reported to the Review Committee for cancellation. The parties deliberated until around 4:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>A dispute that has been going on for a long time is expected to be resolved soon.</p>

<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the first Persian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Austrufan, has been ordered to come to Shanghai and has now rented a consulate building. Mr. Austrufan told a New Voice News Agency reporter yesterday morning that the consulate building he has found is very suitable in location at No. 5, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple. The location is conveniently located between the Xieqiao General Association and the Italian Consulate-General. The consulate will move in and begin operations on June 15. When the consulate is established in the future, a number of officials will be dispatched to Shanghai from Persia. The number will depend on the needs after establishment. The number of Persian overseas Chinese in China is not large, about 100 people, including a small number of overseas Chinese residing in the northeast. There are also very few Chinese traveling to Persia. He hopes that the relationship between China and Persia will become closer in the future, and that commerce will gradually develop. Persia is currently moving forward on the road of development, and China is also becoming stronger and more prosperous. In addition, the reporter learned that the first certificate from the King of Persia to the Chinese government was sent to Shanghai yesterday (19th). Mr. Austrufan plans to personally take someone to Nanjing to submit the certificate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs after the establishment of the consulate.</p>

<p>The Party and government organs are inspecting the antiquities of the Palace Museum stored in Shanghai. It was reported the previous day that the inspection would begin today (21st). A reporter from the Nationalist News Agency specially drove to the residences of Committee Members Wu Xiu and Cai Hongtian of the Municipal Party Department yesterday. According to them, since the Municipal Party Department received the order from the Central Government to allow the museum to hire experts to identify the antiquities, it notified the Shanghai Office of the museum to set a date to begin the inspection. However, the office only verbally agreed to open the inspection on the 21st (today) and did not provide a formal notice. Therefore, the department sent staff member Lin Mengsen to contact Ouyang Banghua, the section chief of the office, yesterday. He said that because the office had not received a reply from the municipal government, the inspection might not be held on the 21st. The date of commencement would depend on the municipal government's reply. However, Wu and Cai said that as they were responsible, they were eager to open the inspection as soon as possible so that it could be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Eight Provinces Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Entire Business is Determined to be Government-Run; The Central Government Approved 1 Million as Capital; All Commercial Shares Paid by Various Provinces will be Returned <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that since November 27 last year, representatives from eight provinces established a preparatory office in Shanghai to determine commercial shares of 1 million. The provincial and municipal governments and rice merchants raised funds for the remaining 1 million of working capital, which was allocated by the central government. The business was of a government-supervised and merchant-operated nature, and Gu Xinyi and Wu Huanru were elected as the director and deputy director to carry out the preparatory work. The deadline for payment of shares was January 10 this year. When more than half of the commercial shares were paid, a shareholders' meeting was held to officially establish the bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Difficulty in Raising Funds <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Up to the beginning of last month, only Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui and Shanghai provinces and cities had paid their shares, totaling 350,000 yuan. Other provinces repeatedly urged but failed to remit. As a result, the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau became virtually stagnant. Bureau Director Gu Xinyi went to Jiangxi last month due to difficulties in raising funds, and met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request instructions. It has been decided that:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Government-Run <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The central government previously approved 1 million of working capital as operating capital. The transportation and sales head office will be located in Shanghai and chaired by Gu Xinyi, appointed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Branch offices or transportation and sales agencies will be established in various commercial port areas in the country, and will be determined at any time depending on the business situation. Now, after the Jiangxi Camp orders arrive in Shanghai, they will start to proceed. Dagong News Agency reporters went directly to Mr. Gu yesterday to inquire about the matter. It is said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is very concerned about relieving the rural areas, so he attaches great importance to the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau. Unfortunately, after half a year, the shares of the provinces are still less than half, which is very regrettable. Now that it has been decided to be government-run, the provinces have already paid</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Commercial Shares will be Returned <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>It is purely operated by the government, but 200,000 yuan of the 350,000 yuan of commercial shares were raised by the provincial and municipal governments and included under the commercial share item. Whether this share will be fully refunded in the future or allocated as an official operating capital item still needs to be requested for instructions before it can be handled. The name and authority of the government agency to which the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau is affiliated must be determined by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After the above two issues are resolved, it can be officially established.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables to Order the Release of Soybean Cakes Detained in Guangdong Province. The Place of Origin Should be Distinguished and No Blanket Detention Should be Allowed <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received cables from the Guangdong Provincial Northern and Southern Ports Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Association, stating that the Guangdong Provincial donation tax contractors, without distinguishing the origin of soybean cakes, forcibly stated that the products of factories in Shanghai and Hankou were imported from the Eastern Provinces, resulting in the detention of more than 20 boats of bean cakes, amounting to more than 18,200 pieces. The Chamber asked for assistance, and the Chamber cabled to the Guangdong Provincial Government for release. This was recorded in the previous report. It is now learned that the Chamber has received a letter from the local Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association, stating that the Guangdong contractors are forcibly detaining soybean cakes from the Shanghai Xixi Factory. The Chamber has cabled the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Guangdong Provincial Government, asking them to order the release immediately to protect the domestic soybean cake production. The original cable is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Cable to the Executive Yuan <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Nanjing:</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, we received a letter from the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association, stating that: “Our factory’s soybean cakes were detained in Guangdong and designated as imported from the Eastern Provinces, and heavy taxes were forcibly collected. We implore a cable order for immediate release, pending instructions with utmost urgency.”</p>
<p>Upon investigation, soybean cakes, peanut cakes, and other similar products are manufactured by factories located in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hankou, all with distinguishable county jurisdictions and verifiable factory locations. Furthermore, the soybeans needed as raw materials are a common agricultural product in various provinces and are not exclusive to the three Eastern Provinces. The five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, located near the production areas, still have a surplus of local materials. Since the customs blockade of the three Eastern Provinces, the taxation of soybeans transported to Shanghai has been heavy. For the sake of profit, merchants would never abandon the nearby and cheap sources in favor of distant and expensive ones. The Guangdong contractors are ignorant of the commercial situation and unwilling to investigate the matter honestly. They only know to rely on their arbitrary and fabricated claims, intending to maximize profits by illegal means. This is an egregious act of destroying the real economy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hereby cable to the esteemed Ministry and Department to request a review and order the Guangdong Provincial Government to strictly instruct the Chenfeng Company to faithfully comply with the original plan, distinguish the place of origin, and clarify the boundaries of taxable and tax-exempt products. No blanket detention should be allowed to cause disturbances and accumulation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Letter to the Guangdong Provincial Government <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Factories that can manufacture soybean cakes are all located in Wuxi, Kunshan, and Wujin counties in Jiangsu Province, and within the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The soybeans used are sourced from the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu, near the production areas. There are verifiable factories and verifiable facts. Therefore, we hereby attach a photo form and submit this letter for review and forwarding to the contractors, to check each one and quickly release the wrongly detained goods. If you think there is something that must be taken seriously, in the future, for soybean cakes shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong, our association can notify the Miscellaneous Grain Association to issue a certificate, certifying the name of the factory and the place of origin of the raw materials, which will be carried with each shipment to Guangdong for identification. We hope you will check and implement this.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Problems Worth Noting in the Sino-Japanese Consolidation of Old Debts; Total Debt Amounted to More Than 590 Million <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that, according to reliable sources, the issue of Sino-Japanese consolidation of old debts is still under discussion and has not been formally proposed. From the perspective of our country, if the Japanese side really has this proposal, the authorities have no reason to refuse. However, there is a more difficult point worth noting or studying by the Chinese people, that is, Japan also has a considerable number of old debts regarding the construction of railways in Northeast China. For example, the 2.47 million loan for the Xin-Feng-Ji-Chang Railway in April 1908, the 5 million loan for the Si-Zheng Railway in December 1915, the 6.5 million loan for the Ji-Chang Railway in May 1917, the 2.6 million short-term loan for the Si-Zheng Railway in December 1918, and the 22.5 million loan for the Si-Tao Railway in 1919 and 1920 are considered by the Japanese side to have no relationship with our country, and are instead being negotiated with the puppet created by Japan (last year Japan had already made this informal statement). Therefore, when consolidating Sino-Japanese old debts, this point really involves the issue of recognizing the puppet organization. However, some people think that it will not be so difficult. In order to avoid de facto recognition of the puppet organization, our country still recognizes that there is this debt for old debts in the Northeast, but it must be stated that under the Japanese force of grabbing and occupying, the Chinese government cannot fulfill the obligations of the loan contract until the Northeast is recovered, and it is stated that the right to claim damages is reserved. According to a reporter’s investigation, the total number of Sino-Japanese debts is more than 590.47 million Japanese yen. In addition, there is the Nishihara loan of 110 million yuan, which our country has never recognized.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since twenty-four manufacturers, including the Chinese tobacco factory merchants and the public in this city, requested the improvement of the cigarette tax rate, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance has prepared an audit explanation for this case, criticizing the errors in the numbers cited by the Public and other companies, and advising tobacco merchants not to be misled by tax reductions and to focus on developing their business. The original text of the explanation is found as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Public and twenty-four other companies requesting the revision of the cigarette tax tiers, their petition was directly submitted to this department. Later, the proposal by Huang Ziping, representative of the Public, and the review opinions of the Cigarette Association's General Assembly were transferred to the department by the Cigarette Association. Overall, the original petition requested a revision of the tiers, mentioning only that the seven-tier system was most beneficial to Chinese merchants, without proposing any specific plan. However, its tax tier calculation table advocated a three-tier system and set 80 yuan as the low-tier tax amount. Its main opinions on the number of tiers were contradictory. The subsequent proposal suddenly made a different claim, stating that the low-tier tax of 80 yuan could be changed. The main purpose of the proposal was no less than a request for tax reduction, which was very different from the original petition's purpose of equal treatment and revision of the tax tiers. As for the review opinions of the Tax System Review Committee of the General Assembly of Members, it merely expanded and explained the claims made in the original petition and proposal, without proposing any concrete plan for improving the tax tiers that could be considered. The statistics adopted in the original petition and the two documents were unfortunately not clearly researched. Now, the more important claims are specifically listed, audited together, and explained in sequence below. (Items listed in the original petition that are also mentioned in the proposal and review opinions are mainly based on the original petition and summarized for auditing to avoid repetition.) (1) The original petition listed errors in the time of the opening and revision of the cigarette consolidated tax. The original petition stated that the cigarette consolidated tax was opened in 1929 and revised three times in November 1930, February 1931, and March 1932. The seven-tier tax era lasted from July 1929 to November 1930, the old three-tier era lasted from November 1930 to February 1931, the new three-tier tax era lasted from February 1931 to March 1932, and the two-tier tax era has lasted from March 1932 to the present. This department's investigation shows that the cigarette consolidated tax was opened in February 1928 and revised five times in December 1928, October 1930, February 1931, March 1932, and November 1933. The old seven-tier era lasted from February 1928 to November, the new seven-tier era lasted from December 1928 to September 1930, the old three-tier era lasted from October 1930 to January 1931, the new three-tier era lasted from February 1931 to March 20, 1932, the old two-tier era lasted from March 21, 1932 to December 4, 1933, and the new two-tier era has lasted from December 5, 1933 to the present. (2) The original petition's description of the number of Chinese merchant bankruptcies is untrue. The original petition stated that there were a total of 150 to 160 Chinese merchants in the seven-tier tax era, but they closed down one after another during the two-tier tax era, and now only 40 to 50 remain. This department's investigation shows that there are two types of cigarette merchant organizations: one is a merchant with a machine factory, commonly known as a cigarette factory, and the other is a merchant that does not have a factory and entrusts another factory to roll the cigarettes, commonly known as a cigarette company or cigarette shop. According to the archives, 87 cigarette factories paid taxes and purchased flowers in 1931, and 90 did not have a machine factory but entrusted another factory to roll the cigarettes, totaling 177. Also in 1932, there were 83 cigarette factories and 44 that did not have a factory but entrusted another factory to roll the cigarettes, totaling 139. Therefore, comparing the total number of merchants paying taxes for the three years, the number has consistently been around 140, with cigarette factories accounting for 80 to 90, maintaining a balance. There is no truth to the original petition's claim that there were 150 to 160 and now only 40 to 50 remain. (3) The original petition's explanation and appended comparison table of British and American sales of stamps and tax payment table both contain errors. Regarding the explanation of the sales of stamps, the original petition stated that the average number of stamps sold by British and American companies in the three-tier tax era was 30,472, while other companies sold 68,422. The quantity of cigarettes sold by British and American companies was only 40% of that of other companies, less than 50%. In the two-tier tax era, the average number of stamps sold by British and American companies was 48,808, while other companies sold 44,323. The quantity of cigarettes sold by British and American companies has exceeded that of other companies by 485. Regarding the explanation of the number of tax payments, the original petition stated that the average number for British and American cigarette companies in the three-tier tax era was 2,417,403.822, while other cigarette companies paid 206,252.647. The British and American companies' burden was 410,000 more than that of Chinese merchants. In the two-tier tax era, the average number for British and American cigarette companies was 2,726,392.522, while other cigarette companies paid 2,554,466.996. The British and American companies' burden was only 170,000 more than that of Chinese merchants. The petitioners based their explanations on the above and separately created a comparison table of the sales of cigarette consolidated tax stamps and a comparison table of tax payments for British and American cigarette companies and other cigarette companies in the three-tier and two-tier tax eras. This department has carefully reviewed the original gazettes and stamp tax account books and found four errors in the statistics used in the original petition regarding the stamp table. (1) The original petition did not examine the actual situation of stamp sales at the time. From the opening of the cigarette consolidated tax to February 1932, the stamps of the former Cigarette Consolidated Tax Office or the former Consolidated Tax Department were sold in two places: one at the Coupon Fund Committee and the other at the former Cigarette Tax Office or the former Consolidated Tax Department. The table of British and American cigarette companies' sales of stamps by grade published in the former Consolidated Tax Gazette refers to the number of stamps purchased by the companies from the Fund Committee. The table of other cigarette companies' sales of stamps by grade refers to the number of stamps sold by the former Consolidated Tax Department. The tax amount listed in the tax payment table in the gazette is also divided into British and American (Column A, the value of flowers purchased from the former Consolidated Tax Department, British and American (Column B, the value of flowers purchased from the Fund Committee). At the time, this was noted monthly in the tax payment table's annotation column. The tax amount listed in the British and American (Column B) of the tax payment table must be equal to the total in the value column of the table of British and American sales of stamps by grade. The two tables can be mutually verified. (For example, in the tax payment table in the January 1931 Consolidated Tax Gazette, the British and American (Column B) counted 1,716,901.250 yuan as the number of flowers purchased by British and American companies from the Fund Committee, which is equal to the total in the value column of the table of British and American sales of stamps by grade, 1,716,901.250 yuan.) Therefore, the number listed in the other companies column in the stamp table compiled by the original petitioners still contains a portion of British and American purchases, totaling 8,934 first-grade stamps (including 1 old third-grade stamp), 37,3397 second-grade stamps, and 306,006 third-grade stamps (including 1,652 old third-grade stamps), for a total of 344,239.1 new and old stamps, equivalent to a tax amount of 15,219,592.7 jiao. The original petition adopted statistics without inquiring clearly beforehand, leading to erroneous one-sided conclusions and incorrect citations. (Attached is a table of British and American purchases of flowers at the department from January 1931 to February 1932.) (2) In February 1931 and March 1932, old tax stamps were returned due to tax rate revisions and should be deducted accordingly. The original petition did not pay attention to this during calculation. (3) March 1932 was a transitional period between the old and new taxes. The number of new and old stamps should have been listed separately to reflect the actual situation. The original petition omitted March, which is not appropriate. (4) Stamps should be calculated according to their face value by tax grade to match the actual tax revenue. The original petition did not distinguish grades or convert tax rates into tax amounts for mutual verification with the tax amount table, inevitably leading to misunderstandings. (For example, in the original stamp table, British and American companies had 24,560 stamps in June, while the tax amount table shows 2,048.629 yuan. However, according to the actual situation, the number of stamps should be divided into 60 first-grade stamps, 2,500 second-grade stamps, and 22,000 third-grade stamps, equivalent to a tax amount of 1,078.8009.) The original petition also made four errors in the tax amount table. (1) The face value of the old tax stamps returned by merchants at the time of the above-mentioned tax revisions was deducted in the tax amount table, but the number was not deducted in the stamp table, so the utility of comparing and verifying stamps and tax amounts was lost, and it was difficult to obtain the true picture from the statistics. (2) The tax amount listed in the former Consolidated Tax Gazette included the cigar tax, which the original petition did not clearly account for. (3) Since imported cigarettes changed to collecting the full amount of the gold unit customs duty in November 1931, all consolidated taxes were waived, but the customs still allocated four-fifths of the collected customs duty to the department monthly. The original tax amount still included this allocation from imports, which should be excluded to reflect the true picture of tax payments from domestically produced cigarettes. The original petition also failed to examine this. (4) During the three-tier tax era, imported goods were stored in warehouses until the two-tier tax was implemented, when they were subject to supplementary tax before leaving the factory, and other supplementary tax issues arose. The supplementary tax collected was recorded in the total tax amount. This supplementary tax was not included in the number of first-grade stamps sold at the time and should also be excluded. However, the original petition uniformly considered it to be the tax amount for domestically produced cigarettes, which is confusing. Based on the above points, the original stamp comparison table and tax amount comparison table have been corrected and recompiled separately with explanations to clarify the truth. Attached are the corrected detailed table of cigarette stamp grades and the cigarette tax revenue trial calculation table for the three-tier and two-tier tax eras. Also, the three-tier tax period lasted for fifteen months. For the convenience of statistical comparison, the number of months for the two-tier tax is also taken as fifteen. (To be continued)</p>

<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the filial daughter Cao E was from Shangyu, Kuaiji. Her father, named Yan, was skilled in stringed instruments and singing and was a shaman. On the fifth day of the fifth month of the second year of Han An (the reign of Emperor Shun of Han), he drowned while praying to welcome the gods. Cao E was fourteen years old and cried along the river for seventeen days before jumping into the river and dying. After several days, she floated out with her father's corpse in her arms. Nine years later, the county magistrate Du Shang reburied her and Han Zhan Chun wrote a wonderful epitaph to record the miracle. In the first year of the Han Yuanjia era, a temple was built by the river to honor the filial daughter. Zhu E of the Song Dynasty and Zhu E of the Ming Dynasty were worshiped continuously in all dynasties. In the tenth year of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the temple was once destroyed by fire, but only the rear hall was affected. On July 19, 1929, the entire temple was burned down, becoming scorched earth. The old yellow silk tablet from two thousand years ago was destroyed in an instant, and there was no one to rewrite it like Cai Bian, which is a shame to the ancients. Now Shanghai and Zhejiang gentlemen and merchants Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, Wang Zhengying, etc., have initiated the reconstruction of the Filial Daughter Temple as a plan to revive traditional morality and have established a preparatory committee, issued donation books, and are raising funds from all walks of life. It is hoped that during this period when the New Life Movement is sweeping the country, there will be enthusiastic donations to support and protect the typical figures in history, and that alms will be collected to accomplish this great undertaking.</p>

Any citizens who wish to receive vaccinations can go directly to the branches, this bureau, or the health offices and clinics in each district for vaccinations.

<p>The Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals, noting that there are often cruel acts inflicted on innocent animals in the market, such as suffocating pigeons with small coin pouches, cutting the tongues of pheasants to kill them, breaking the tails of snails, hanging chickens and ducks upside down, and skinning frogs, etc., points out that such behavior was previously prohibited by the Shanghai Mixed Court, with offenders being fined. Using innocent animals as food is already inappropriate, and to cause them more pain before death is even more unbearable for the benevolent. They have specifically sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, requesting that they issue a ban in accordance with the previous Shanghai Mixed Court's ban on cruelty to living beings, in order to protect living beings and curb cruelty.</p>
<h3 id="e171">A Domestic Helper Dies Tragically from Abortion at a Westerner's Home; The Paramour Flees Without a Trace; The Doctor is Still Under Investigation <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Fang Zhang, a woman from Hangzhou, 39 years old, residing at 162 Hart Road, was widowed. Zhang was quite romantic and worked as a domestic helper in a Westerner's home. Unaccustomed to living alone, she had an affair with someone, and after repeated clandestine meetings, she became pregnant. Recently, in order to save face, Ms. Zhang intended to remove the fetus, so she hired a doctor to perform an abortion. Unexpectedly, although the fetus was removed from the abdomen, she fell ill and her condition worsened day by day. A few days ago, she was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died shortly after. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that the man had fled without a trace, and the female doctor who performed the abortion was from Fahua Town in Shanghai West. She first gave Ms. Zhang medicine and then performed surgery. Since the detectives knew that the female doctor lived in the Chinese area, they were unable to investigate. The Sixth District Public Security Bureau has been notified to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Philemon Road. Zhang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the office to examine the body. Shou Tianxi testified that he was 35 years old, from Hangzhou, and had been living in his hometown as a merchant. He learned of the matter and came to Shanghai, temporarily residing at the home of a friend at 231 Xinyili, Morling Road. The deceased was his uncle's wife. She had been working as a domestic helper in a Westerner's home in Shanghai. Her husband had already passed away and she had several children. He did not know the rest of the details. Since none of her family members were here, he requested permission to claim the body. Prosecutor Zhang accepted the testimony and ordered an examination, which determined that the deceased, Fang Zhang, died of peritonitis caused by an abortion. The body was handed over to Shou Tianxi to be taken back for burial.</p>

In the evening, he peeped through a crack in the board and saw Wang counting the bills, all of which were cancelled banknotes. He remained silent and secretly stole several hundred yuan the next day. Wang returned home and found out, causing a great commotion. The news spread, and Wang's usual loan sharks and creditors from his gambling days also arrived. Wang knew things were not good, so he repaid his debts and distributed dozens of yuan to each person. Those who received this benefit included Meng Guopei, Wang Jinkui, Wang Qixian, Wang Li, Zhou Wang, and Lu Yang. Wang knew that the matter had been publicized and was dangerous, so he took the money and fled back to Jiangbei, living the life of a small rich man. However, the news gradually leaked out due to the large number of people involved and was learned by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Meng was arrested and confessed the reason, so detectives Sun Shucheng, Zhang Yuzhuo, Zhou Wenhai, and Yang Zhongjin were sent to Jiangbei to arrest Wang Baokang and others. However, the detectives used their authority to seize the stolen money and divide it among themselves, and raped Lu Yang. After arriving in Shanghai, the case was investigated in the Third Division of the Public Security Bureau. Due to many flaws in the handling of the case, after strict questioning of the defendants, this shocking and absurd incident was discovered. Therefore, the detectives were detained and sent to the District Court for public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Zhang sentenced them all to minor punishments. Wang Baokang was fined 200 yuan for encroachment and 50 yuan for gambling, totaling 220 yuan. Meng Guopei and Wang Jinkui were each fined 80 yuan for receiving stolen goods. Wang Qixian was fined 90 yuan for receiving stolen goods and gambling. Sun Shucheng was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for encroachment. Zhang Yuzhuo, Zhou Wenhai, and Yang Zhongjin were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Wang Li, Zhou Wang, and Lu Yang were not guilty because they were women.</p>
<p>A Horrible Incident</p>
<h3 id="e173">A Russian Commits Suicide While Drunk, Yimalef was in the Hat Business, A Bullet to the Temple, He Died Instantly <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>In room 2 on the second floor of the Western-style apartment building at 847 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession lived Yimalef, a White Russian traveler, 46 years old, who was in the hat business. He was addicted to alcohol, and most of his income was spent on it. Yimalef also had a natural bad habit, that is, he must drink when he sees alcohol, he must get drunk after drinking, and he must cause trouble after getting drunk. His wife, Al Zhaomiler (48 years old), often advised him, but Yimalef still drank heavily as usual, without any repentance, which often caused disputes between the couple. Yesterday at about 4:15 PM, Yimalef was drinking again, and as a result, he was drunk and didn't know what he was doing. He suddenly felt a sense of being in a foreign land and of family discord. He suddenly had the idea of committing suicide, and hid in the kitchen alone, opened a pistol and committed suicide. The first bullet grazed his left forehead, and the second bullet hit his right temple, killing him instantly. His wife heard the sound and rushed over, but Yimalef had already fallen in a pool of blood. She immediately reported to the police station. The police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and then sent the body to the forensic examination office on Taras Road, waiting for the court to send someone to examine it.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Contribution of the United Premium Company - A New Strategy for Developing Industry and Commerce <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The United Premium Co., Ltd. was initiated by prominent figures in this city and organized in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law of the Co., Ltd., and has been approved for registration by the Ministry of Industry and issued a license No. 662. After the company was established, it set up an office on the third floor of 110 Sichuan Road in order to save time and realize its goals as soon as possible, so that all sectors could enjoy its benefits, and actively proceeded. It hired lawyer Liu Shifang as its legal advisor and accountant Xu Yongzuo as its auditor. On the one hand, given that this type of business has been popular in Europe and the United States for many years and has achieved remarkable results, people in those countries have believed that it is the only good strategy to promote business to increase sales of existing goods and to gain a position for new goods. However, in China, this is the first of its kind. In order to improve, a special commissioner was sent to the United States for detailed investigation, and the results of the investigation have been sent to Shanghai. The opening is near, around mid-July. The details are summarized below:</p>
<h3 id="e175">Business <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The company's business, the greatest goal, is to assist merchants and develop business. Because today all industries are in recession and the public's purchasing power is shrinking, it is necessary to supplement excellent quality and fair prices with premiums. Then the public will not receive unexpected benefits, and manufacturers can increase business, benefit each other, and adjust each other, so that the market can be restored to prosperity. However, the current premium methods are carried out independently and have no strong appeal or considerable interest. Now the company specially prints joint premium coupons and sells them to manufacturers for joint application, attaching them to goods to be given away. Those who get the coupons can accumulate a certain amount and exchange them for various premiums they like at the premium exchange offices set up by the company. Because of the ease of getting the coupons, the variety of premiums, and the intense interest, and careful calculation, this is a great cost-saving method. This method is popular in Europe and the United States, and adopters have benefited three times over. For example, the Winterford Company in the United States increased its business by as much as 81 percent by using this premium coupon. Now the company's approach is roughly similar to that of the United States' greatest joint profit-sharing company, but it also fits the current social situation in China and is enough to solve the difficulties of merchants. Therefore, if handled properly, success can be assured.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Premiums <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The premiums used by the company are mainly novel and practical. All are ordered from major famous factories. More than 700 types have been selected by the company, and the selection is still in progress. In the future, there will be a dazzling array, which is predictable.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Exchange Office <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The company's premium exchange office in this city is attached to the Guangshi Company on Nanjing Road. In other places, it is handled by branches of the China Travel Service, including Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Bengbu, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Jinchang, Hangzhou, Quanhua, Guangzhou, and Kaifeng, etc. Later, it will also add to the places in succession in order to seek popularization. In places outside this city where there is no premium exchange office, coupon holders can exchange premiums by mail to the Shanghai General Management Office of the company.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Catalog <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>In order to make the public understand the premium exchange method and various premiums, the company will print 500,000 copies of the premium catalog for widespread distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Instructions <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The company has printed a book entitled "How to Promote Sales and Develop Business" for merchants to understand the company's business and the advantages of joint premiums. Merchants can write to the company for a copy, which will be sent immediately.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, commonly known as Buddha's Birthday. Jing'an Temple in Shanghai West is extremely lively every year on this day.

The Jing'an Temple Police Station specially dispatched dozens of mounted patrols and special police to patrol and maintain traffic on both sides and set up more posts. At the same time, the Sixth District Public Security Bureau also strengthened security within the boundary. The British-owned Public Bus Company and Tram Company temporarily increased the number of runs. Because the Women's National Products Association had a temporary market, there were even more visitors. The total sales yesterday reached more than 60,000 yuan. The vendors along the way were also making ten times the profit, and the lively situation was unprecedented.</p>

<p>Wang Mo, courtesy name Bingqing, a native of Shaoxing and chief of the Document Section of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, nearly sixty years old, left his residence at 9 Xinmale Lane, South Chengdu Road, at about 9 a.m. on March 21 this year and took the No. 4 tram to the Taxation Department (on the Bund, New Customs Building) to work. Just as he was getting on the tram, he was suddenly hit by a private car No. 592 driven by a chauffeur named Gao Chunsheng and owned by a Russian doctor, Mikechi. Because of his old age and serious injuries, he died despite medical treatment. The French police department transferred Gao to the Second Special District Court for prosecution on the charge of causing death by negligence in business operations. Wang Jiazhen, son of the victim, also hired a lawyer to file a private suit, seeking damages of 30,000 yuan. After the trial, Gao Chunsheng was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to compensate the victim's family for 5,000 yuan in losses. The details have been reported in previous newspapers.

<p>There are many people who practice Taijiquan these days. However, few people can understand the mysteries of its body use. Practicing in this way is like not practicing at all. Mr. Yang Chengfu of Guangping has been proficient in Taijiquan for generations and has obtained the true inheritance of Wudang. He used to set up accounts in the old capital, and his followers were like clouds. He came south last year in response to the invitation of the Guoshu Museum. Those who admired his name and went to ask for instruction were more numerous than the carps crossing the river. That is how moving and admirable he is. It is now heard that Mr. Yang lamented the weakness of the country and believed that only by promoting martial arts could survival be ensured. Furthermore, because there were very few books on Taijiquan in the market that combined body use, he published his true inheritance as "Complete Book on Taijiquan Body Use". He revealed all the true essence of Taijiquan body use, and the basic training methods and pushing hands, etc., are all attached with illustrations. Chiang Kai-shek, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, and other gentlemen have seen it and exclaimed it as an unprecedented masterpiece in the Guoshu world, and personally inscribed it to promote it. Now the first volume of the book has been published. Shanghai Dadong Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, Author's Bookstore, Mr. Zhang Yincang's Doctor After Yard Bu Yaxuan at 195 Confucius Temple, Nanjing, and other places are all selling it on consignment. Those who have not learned Taijiquan must have this book in hand, and those who have already learned Taijiquan but have not yet obtained the mystery of body use must read it once.</p>

After the formal opening ceremony, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that radio is a modern scientific endeavor, particularly important for maritime safety. The organization of the Welfare Association aims to achieve the following principles: In terms of academics, radio technology has made rapid progress in recent years, and service personnel should have opportunities to discuss and improve their knowledge. In terms of service, there should be adequate communication to facilitate mutual assistance in work. Radio operators serve at sea and bear significant responsibility, often sacrificing their lives in maritime disasters. However, their treatment is not always ideal, so a group organization is urgently needed to improve their livelihoods. Subsequently, Comrade Xu Zhennan, Director of the Labor Guidance Section of the Maritime Workers' Special Party Branch, delivered a speech, stating that radio operators are high-ranking sailors with heavy responsibilities. The Party Branch greatly approves of the establishment of this association and hopes that all members will strive for the overall benefit of the association. He also hopes that responsible personnel will handle matters responsibly, so that the association's affairs will prosper. He believes that all members have received higher education and will not disappoint the Party Branch's expectations. The meeting then commenced to discuss association affairs and review the association's constitution, scrutinize application forms and membership cards, and resolved that the second preparatory committee meeting would be held at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month, still at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Welfare Association, chaired by Ding Junyu.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Genius and Personality <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Answering Mr. Luo Zhi, Mr. Shen Feng, and Mr. Yang Lihui</p>
<p>"I lack the genius to study literature." "My personality is not suitable for studying philosophy!" We often see and hear such sentences in letters from many readers and in conversations. They look with disappointed eyes at many modern writers who have "genius" and those whose "personalities" are suited for studying certain subjects. They themselves have lost confidence and lack the ambition to study literature and explore philosophical principles. They think that "genius" and "personality" are innate, just like being born to "both wealthy and noble" parents, which is completely beyond your control. They still admire these knowledge holders very much, just like beggars still salivate when they see "delicacies from land and sea." However, they can only sigh and cannot take a step forward to acquire them.</p>
<p>This is a very wrong concept. It hinders the progress of learning, erodes the enthusiasm of young people, and will make people give up on themselves, recognizing themselves as low-achievers who can only be content with poverty and ignorance, forever bowing their heads to those "geniuses" who control their knowledge, daring not to move even a bit.</p>
<h3 id="e200">We Must First Eliminate Mistaken Learning! <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The natural formation of this misconception is not a simple matter; it has its social foundation and other complex factors. To enable a wider audience to understand the following explanation, we have compiled the following dialogue, based on frequently raised questions in recent letters and conversations, to aid readers in their interest in reading this communication.</p>
<p>- Sir! Does 'genius' exist at all, and how should it be explained?</p>
<p>- In my opinion, the term 'genius' should never be interpreted as innate; it is still determined by the environment of social life. You know, Edison was a great scientist, probably considered a 'genius'. He could only have been born in the 20th century, not in the Middle Ages. He could only have been born in the highly developed capitalist group of the United States, not in 'India' or 'China'?</p>
<p>- What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>- It's because Edison's inventions were not due to him having different cells in his body compared to others; his inventions were built on the conditions of scientific development in America. The conditions for nurturing his talent's development required the legacy of natural scientific knowledge from predecessors, scientific machinery equipment, and social needs. In the Middle Ages, natural scientific knowledge was insufficient, lacking the premise for his inventions. As for India and China, the colonial environment there would not allow for the emergence of such talents. Therefore, India can only produce 'Tagores,' and China currently can only produce figures like 'certain child prodigies,' whose inventions are merely 'scientific Ouija boards.' Don't laugh, if Mr. Edison of America were unfortunately born in China, he might have become a child prodigy himself, which wouldn't be surprising at all!</p>
<p>- Sir, don't you think that white people have higher intelligence than us? - It cannot be denied that white people generally have a higher cultural standard than us at present, but this does not mean that their race is born superior to others; it is that their social living conditions are better than ours! When it comes to the intelligence of races, there is no distinction. Currently, the capitalists among white people and the scholars they support are fabricating absurd claims that white people are superior to mixed-race people. This is nothing more than wanting to use racial superiority to rule the slaves in the colonies, so that these lackeys do not resist and willingly flatter their masters! We cannot explain Edison's inventions from the superiority of racial qualities, but only from social conditions! - Sir, I agree with the above explanation when comparing the United States and China, but why do individuals have differences in the same environment, such as in the United States or China? I always feel that 'genius' exists, and it is partly innate.</p>
<p>- The reasons for individual differences are very complex. There are no two identical leaves in the world. However, even the most obvious differences are caused by social conditions. Different lives create different bodies, different intellects, and different thoughts. Wealthy people eat a lot and become obese, while hungry people are inevitably thin and emaciated. Wealthy people can study from kindergarten to studying abroad, while poor people are illiterate all their lives. Wealthy people always want world peace and lasting prosperity, while poor people are afraid of the world changing - none of this is accidental. So-called 'geniuses' are all cultivated by acquired environments, not innate superior breeds. It is impossible for an illiterate person to become an Edison, and it is only a fantasy to become a Tagore because he lacks the conditions to express his abilities. For example, in the case of Mr. He, because he has not yet graduated from elementary school, he cannot appreciate literature as easily as a university student. This is because he lacks cultivation, not because his 'genius' is inferior to others. Many of today's Chinese writers have better cultivation than Mr. He, and some have been forged in hardship. Because they do not believe that 'princes and generals' have a fixed lineage, they do not believe in 'genius,' they want to struggle hard, and as a result, they have succeeded. However, there are still no writers in China who come from illiteracy, because an illiterate person must go through the stage of literacy to become a writer. If Chinese characters can be simplified immediately and illiteracy can be eliminated, then how many 'genius' writers would emerge from the people who are now considered inferior! Therefore, it is the social system that creates the current individual differences. The social environment restricts your development. It creates many different species from many homogeneous people, just as the same seed sown in the desert and fertile soil produces different results, which has little to do with the seed itself. Therefore, I say that 'genius' is not innate.</p>
<p>- I still have some doubts. Why do people born of the same parents and in the same small living environment have such vastly different differences?</p>
<p>- That's right! Such differences do exist. And differences will always exist, which means that there are no two completely identical things in the universe. But in the current society, the different intelligence of children born of the same parents is largely due to the influence of better or worse social lives in the time after each person's birth. If these reasons are ignored, the remaining differences are not bad things. Because these differences do not restrict their development but only determine their development in different directions. This is precisely enriching the universe, not artificially harming human intelligence. In short, in the future society, the words 'foolishness' and 'wisdom' will gradually be eliminated. 'Genius' will only be used as a compliment, a congratulatory speech to celebrate a successful person, not limited to the identity of a part of the people, and even less can it be interpreted as 'innate.' In the future, if there is still this term, it will be a symbol of victory that everyone can obtain. - According to your explanation, people like us who lack the conditions for development have no hope of development in this life?</p>
<p>- Not at all! We lack the conditions for development, and we should create conditions that are conducive to the development of our masses. For example, in your case (referring to Mr. He), since you have graduated from elementary school and want to study literature, the road to development is certainly very difficult, but it does not mean that you cannot open a path. What is problematic here is not the objective difficulties, but the errors in your concepts. If you believe that 'princes and generals' must come from 'the houses of princes and generals,' that you yourself are a mediocre seed, lacking some kind of 'genius,' then you naturally have no determination to conquer the environment, and you will inevitably erode the vitality of your life in this concept. If you have a transformation in your concepts, you may use the conditions permitted in your current living range to advance step by step. If you want to become a writer, you can actually experience life and cultivate your writing skills at the same time, and you can naturally hope to open up a path in literature. Even for an illiterate person, as long as he is not content with 'fate,' he will naturally rise up, first improving his minimum living standard, and when his life improves, he will demand to expand his knowledge, demand to be literate and read, and he will also demand that others can do any part of the social work that he can also engage in. Therefore, we feel that you are not hopeless in this life, but it depends on whether you work hard!</p>
<p>- I understand everything now. The level of intelligence is entirely determined by social reasons and the degree to which you strive to conquer the environment. The so-called 'genius' is not something that ordinary people cannot achieve, but it is just that others either do not have the opportunity or are unwilling to fight. Sir, do you think that's right?</p>
<p>- That's right! Do you have any other questions?</p>
<p>- No. I originally had another question, which is the difference in personality. Now that I have heard your explanation of the term 'genius,' this question has also been solved in connection. 'Personality' is naturally also cultivated by the environment, isn't it?</p>
<p>- Yes!</p>
<p>- Then, personality should also be changeable. I often hear many friends say that one's personality is close to literature and that most of them do not understand mathematics. Now I feel that since personality can be changed by the environment, can't a person who studies literature also become someone who likes to study mathematics?</p>
<p>- Of course! Many young people now have a misunderstanding about personality. They do not understand what personality is. They think that whatever is easy to study is close to their personality, otherwise it is not close. Therefore, your friends think that literature and social sciences are easy to study and require less effort. Mathematics requires performing problems and following step-by-step procedures, so it is more difficult. In fact, many people regard learning as too cheap, and when they encounter difficulties, they think it is not close to their personality, so they abandon what they are studying halfway. In fact, literature and social sciences are no easier than mathematics and require hard work. Personality is certainly cultivated by the environment, but it cannot be determined that one's personality is not close based on a shallow attempt at knowledge. It is right to value the conditions suitable for one's own research, and there is no need to force oneself to pursue it if there are no conditions for learning chemistry, but it is wrong to determine that it is not suitable for one's own personality because of difficulties. Because personality is determined by the environment, it can naturally be transformed. For example, the Chinese masses currently need to understand the national crisis and international politics, but they cannot ignore the knowledge that citizens should have because of some personality that is not close to it. How should we transform it, make it interested in ourselves, and change the reasons that caused this neglect of politics and avoidance of practice? As for those whose living conditions are suitable for advancing in a certain field of knowledge, in addition to not ignoring common knowledge, other specialties can be freely developed by him, and there is no need to force each other, nor is there any reason to force him to switch to a certain special field of knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e201">The Fragrant Cloud Records of Imperial Incense <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>- Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The interior of the imperial carriage was entirely draped with apricot-yellow tribute silk. The colors of these silks were particularly vibrant and were frequently changed. When the Empress Dowager was about to use it, Li Lianying would personally go over and carefully examine it. If there were any stains or missing items, he would immediately have them repaired or replaced. When the Empress Dowager entered the imperial carriage, a cloth curtain would be temporarily added around it, so that no one could peek at her. Even the eunuchs assigned to carry this imperial carriage could not see her. Only after she was seated securely in the imperial carriage was the cloth curtain removed; at the same time, the porters carefully took on this heavy burden. If, unfortunately, one of the porters took a wrong step, causing the Empress Dowager in the imperial carriage to fall, or even if she didn't fall but was frightened, it would be a major incident! At most, within half a day, the heads of these sixteen porters would all be hanging down! However, as far as I know, such a thing has never actually happened: because the sixteen porters who carried this imperial carriage for the Empress Dowager could be said to be the best of the best selected from tens of thousands of porters in China. In any case, they would never take a wrong step. They themselves were often very proud and thought that being able to serve the Empress Dowager was truly the most glorious thing. Their clothing was also very beautiful: they wore ordinary skullcaps, but without any decorations such as tops or feathers! They wore a light red vest on their upper body; below, they wore lake-green trousers; on their feet were dark black boots, but not long ones.</p>
<p>Whether starting or walking, they were very careful; of course, they knew that being beheaded was not an interesting thing! (38)</p>

<p>There is an ancient saying: "Wrath is a fierce tiger, desire is a deep abyss." Getting angry is indeed very harmful to the body. According to research by psychologists, when people are angry, all functions stop. If you lose your temper while eating, it will make you unable to eat. Therefore, Napoleon also said: People who cannot form a habit of self-control cannot have healthy bodies. To curb anger, we can only work hard on the word "patience." If patience is achieved, anger will naturally be curbed. The Western philosopher Cicero said: "We must conquer anger as we conquer a strong enemy." Gifford Johnson also said: "When angry, count from one to ten before speaking. When very angry, count from one to one hundred." These statements are nothing more than calling on rude people to do more patience. A passage recorded in ancient books is very worth introducing: When Fu Bi was young, someone scolded him, and he pretended not to hear. Someone said: "He is scolding you." Bi said: "I am afraid he is scolding someone else." He also said: "He is calling your name." Bi said: "I am afraid it is someone with the same name." The man was very ashamed.</p>
<p>We young people with vigor and vitality are most prone to getting angry. We might as well learn from Fu Bi, but we must remember: "The anger of blood and qi cannot be had, but the anger of righteousness and reason cannot be without."</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Substitute Rickshaw Puller <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>- Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>My friend Mr. W called me and asked me to go to his place - Rue Mercier. Because time was very tight, I hailed a rickshaw on Rue du Consulat and got on. The elastic rubber wheels rolled silently on the smooth asphalt road - Avenue Dubail, especially without shaking. My eyes slowly surveyed the residences, fences, tiger stoves, incense paper shops, and indistinct pedestrians along the way, feeling infinitely leisurely and comfortable, more so than those sitting in cars!</p>
<p>"Avenue Dubail!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Avenue Dubail!"</p>
<p>On the movable iron tongs of the rickshaw's canopy hung a Jiangbei man who looked like a rickshaw puller, which I could tell from his accent. He pulled the iron tongs and followed the rickshaw closely. The rickshaw puller turned his head and said the name of the road to him, and he squeezed out a sentence very concernedly</p>
<p>"Rue de la Porte de France!"</p>
<p>When we arrived at Rue de la Porte de France, the rickshaw puller called out the street sign as usual: but there was no response, was he panting too hard to squeeze out a word, or did he understand and take it for granted? I didn't ask about Pont de France, Rue de Zikawei, Rue du Marché, Rue Bayle. The rickshaw puller called out as usual, but with a slightly hoarse voice, not as loud as at the beginning; therefore, sometimes he "understood tacitly," and sometimes he could only make a couple of echoes from the bottom of his throat. After passing Lokawei, even the rickshaw puller didn't announce it publicly. Undoubtedly, that was because he himself was also "baffled," because he was asking me where to run,</p>
<p>No matter how small a "trade" is, if we are not "hereditary" or "noble," and we want to make it a career, we should put in some practical effort and spend a sum of expected losses. This substitute rickshaw puller wasted precious time and exhausted his strength, just for the sake of future gains. There is nothing in sight. I thought,</p>

<p>Chapter 29 - Returning to the Injured Foot, Sadness, Solitary Survival, Listening to Hua, Greed, Blood Oath, Common Loyalty</p>
<p>When Yang Guizhi received Gan Binzhi's letter, she knew that something was not right, but refusing to accept it and holding each other at the gate would only make things worse if a second person saw it. So, regardless of everything, she quickly took the letter from Lianjiang. From Binzhi's point of view, he believed that where there is a will, there is a way, and he didn't feel anything strange, but Guizhi was determined to leave Binzhi. Binzhi giving her such a letter, she naturally regarded it as a kind of demon. It was not only shy, but also considered extremely immoral. Therefore, she didn't bother to delay at the gate and turned around and went back to her house. Fortunately, Zhao Weng was not at home, so she closed the door and read Binzhi's letter from beginning to end. After reading it, she couldn't help but sneer and say to herself: Isn't this a dream? She took the letter in her hand and pondered it quietly, thinking that this matter should not be concealed from her mother. If she told her directly, and if there was any turmoil, the mother and son could discuss it together. Having an older person to direct them would always provide more knowledge. So, without hesitation, she took the letter and rushed to Jiang's room, raised the letter, and said with a calm face: Mom! Look, isn't this a joke? Gan Er Ye wrote a letter to me in good faith, rambling and saying a lot. Jiang's face immediately turned red, and she gasped and said; What are you looking at? What are you shouting about? Saying that, she stood up and rushed to close the door first. Only then did she whisper: This is nonsense. He wrote a letter to you, what did he say in the letter? Read it to me. Guizhi blushed and didn't read the letter first, but said with a taut face; This is really a joke. (388)</p>

<p>In order to understand the actual situation of the rural economy and to find a possible way out, our school held a rural production survey. Although we solemnly conveyed the motives and purposes of our survey to the farmers in advance, the following incident still occurred on the first day.</p>
<p>"Sir! Thank you! Don't write us down in the book!" An old farmer who was nearly fifty years old begged us tremblingly.</p>
<p>"Uncle! It doesn't matter, it doesn't cost you any money. This is held in our school, and we can guarantee it!" I said sincerely to him.</p>
<p>"Alas! Sir! Some time ago, someone from the town went to the countryside, nailed a piece of foreign lead skin on my door, and asked us for a string of money! Also, my said that if your names are written down, the superiors will come to arrest you to fight the Communists!" he said.</p>

<p>- Chen Shicheng</p>
<p>Yanzhou is located in the upper reaches of the Zhijiang River, thirty miles from Xukou. It goes east to Wuling, west to Shexian County, and south to Lanxi. It has important transportation routes. Since the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiang Railway, its situation has changed. I and Hu Ziboxiang and others traveled to the Seven-Li Rapids. When the boat reached Yancheng, it was already eight bells down. I heard that the motorboat stopped at Yandongguan, about three miles from the city. You have to walk there. Now it has been raining for a long time and the water has risen, so you can reach Yancheng directly. Abandoning the boat to go ashore, we went to Wang Wanchun for dinner together.</p>
<p>Yancheng has a dangerous terrain and fertile land. It is a rich country. In recent years, the low price of grain has harmed farmers, and the income is only enough to pay taxes, resulting in the decline of all industries, the poverty of the people, and the exhaustion of wealth. Our country, China, is based on agriculture, and Jiangzhe is known for its prosperity, but rural bankruptcy is so, and the many bandits are well-founded. We set off at half past seven on the morning of the 31st. Leaving the east gate and turning right, we arrived at Qilang Temple at a quarter past eight. The temple is built facing the river, with a majestic momentum. The door has a plaque that says "Ancient Jianchang Hall." The hall enshrines the spirit of Anle King Qilang. To the right of the temple is the Jianjiang Pavilion, a pavilion tower, which can be climbed to view the scenery. Looking south at the Qiantang River, the waves</p>
<p>It is as flat as a mirror, with mountains facing each other, and distant trees containing smoke. Those who are open-minded and happy will stay for a long time.</p>
<p>Leaving the temple at five past eight, we crossed the river and headed towards Nangaofeng. There is a Xun Pagoda on the top of the peak, named because the land is located in the Xun position of Yancheng. At five past ten, we arrived at Tianning Temple. The temple is located next to the pagoda and is very simple. We went to climb the pagoda together. The pagoda is built of bricks, and only five floors can be climbed, with sixteen to twenty steps per floor. Looking north at Yancheng, it is like living at the bottom of a cauldron. According to the words of various physiognomists, it is also a blessed place. Downstairs, we went to the temple to ask for tea to quench our thirst. The monks in the temple offered pickled vegetables and salted radishes, which tasted very delicious. In a moment, all the utensils were eaten up. Asked about its method, it was only to put the radish at the bottom of the vat when pickling vegetables in winter. The abbot's name is Gongyuan, who is amiable and kind, but his face is pale. At eleven o'clock, we hired a small boat to cross the boat. The boat is narrow and long like a shuttle, without a cabin. There were eight people in the same company, and it was almost impossible to accommodate them. At forty past eleven, we arrived at Yandongguan, landed and had a meal at Taste My Home. After that, the group climbed Beigaofeng.</p>
<p>The peak is outside Yandongguan, and the land is located in the Mao position of Yancheng, so the tower on the top of the peak is named after Mao. It stands opposite Nangaofeng across the river. At ten past two, we left Yandongguan, and the peak was already towering in front of us. The mountain is steep and narrow, and the road is narrow like a sheep intestine, winding and circling in a zigzag shape. We mustered up our courage to climb, but before reaching the waist of the book, we were already panting and unable to stop. At thirty-five past two, we arrived at Tonggu Temple. The temple faces the river with its back to the mountain, and the momentum is very magnificent. There is a couplet on the palace by Liu Zongbiao of Xiling: "Pulling up a lone peak, opening the auspiciousness of the third yuan of the imperial examination." "A pillar that shocks the sky, locking the waves of ten thousand hectares of the river." The couplet seems to refer to something, but unfortunately the monks in the temple do not understand the meaning of the text, so they asked and could not answer. The abbot's name is Pucang, a lay Buddhist who guards the temple, using a stick as a guide, and went to visit Maota. The tower is also built of bricks, towering on the top of the peak, about ten feet higher than the temple, and all seven floors can be climbed. At ten past two, we arrived at the top of the tower, overlooking the Qiantang River, winding like a belt, and the creek meandering from the south, meeting in front of the peak. Looking north at Wulong, it is majestic and beautiful, surrounded by mountains, like a tiger crouching and a dragon盘, the smoky trees are blurred, presenting a group of dark colors, and the sailing walls are looming, sometimes going and sometimes coming, a natural picture is exhausted.</p>
<p>Turning down, we followed the old road. The road is narrow and winding, and the soil is mostly sandy, making it slippery and not leaving enough feet. At thirty-five past three, we arrived at the Immortal Well. The well is located in the east of the temple, with two mouths, arranged side by side like human eyes. The water is slightly white. Pucang said that the source of the North Well is Creek, and the source of the South Well is Zhengzhou. Although they are located side by side in the mountains, their clarity is different. Looking at it, it is true. Mountain residents have difficulty in fetching water, so they get this good convenience. The strangeness of creation is all the more convincing.</p>
<p>At ten past four, we returned to Yancheng, and entered Xingren Gate at a quarter past five. Donghu is already in sight. There are six hospitals and the Yanziling Ancestral Temple. Most of the houses are built in Western style. To the right is West Lake, which is smaller than East Lake. After browsing for a moment, we left and returned.</p>

<p>Special Issue of the 10th Far Eastern Games</p>
<h3 id="e208">Unhappy Closing of the Far Eastern Games: Our Delegation Withdraws from the Executive Committee, Firmly Expressing Opposition to the Illegal Amendment of the Charter. Disappointing Basketball Championship Loss to the Philippines Last Night. Our Country Wins Football Championship 4-3 Against Japan. <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games concluded yesterday. During the Executive Committee meeting, our country's representatives, unwilling to accept illegal pressure, collectively withdrew. The outcome regarding the amendment of the charter resulted in a stalemate. While the Philippines agreed to our country maintaining Article 3 of the charter, which stipulates that "the admission of new member states requires the unanimous approval of existing member states," they also proposed amending Article 10 of the charter, which would allow non-member states to participate in exhibition matches. Our country firmly opposed this, leading to a heated debate. Our representatives resolutely withdrew midway through the meeting. Although the Japanese and Philippine representatives continued the meeting, no concrete results were achieved. Japan even declared the dissolution of the congress last night. The Executive Committee also passed many motions. Women's tennis, volleyball, swimming, diving, shooting, boxing, and wrestling will all be upgraded to official championship events starting from the next Games. In the all-around competition, the 3000-meter steeplechase will be added, and a 5000-meter long-distance run will be added to the track and field events. All competition events of yesterday's congress, except for tennis, where only three groups were held (the Philippines led 2-1), which still need to be completed today, have been resolved. In the football final, our country defeated Japan 4-3, retaining this sole championship. In the China-Philippines basketball final, although our country fought hard in the first half (a 20-20 tie), the Philippine team ultimately defeated us 44-33. The championship continued to be won by the Philippines. The Philippines-Japan baseball final ended in a 2-2 tie and was terminated due to darkness, resulting in the championship being awarded to the Philippines. In the China-Philippines women's tennis exhibition, each side won once. Our national team is scheduled to return on the 23rd and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 28th. The long-anticipated 10th Far Eastern Games have thus come to a close.</p>
<p>Opposing the Illegal Amendment of the Charter</p>
<h3 id="e209">Our Representatives Resolutely Leave the Venue. The Philippines Proposes Amending Article 10, Allowing Non-Member Countries to Participate in Exhibitions. The Compromise Clearly Shows Collusion. Japan Even Declares the Dissolution of the Far Eastern Games. <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 20th) The Far Eastern Athletic Association Committee continued its meeting at the Columbia Club at 10:00 AM on the 20th. Those in attendance included Honorary President Ryozo Hiranuma, Chinese representatives Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, and Ma Yuehan, Japanese representatives Matsuzawa, Abe, and Shibuya, Philippine representatives Bumbucanao, Schnees, and Arras, Chairman Vargas, Secretary Ylaran. The Dutch East Indies were not present. Members of various subcommittees also participated. The reports of the various subcommittees were discussed and passed after amendments. The discussion was completed at 1:15 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Philippines Argues to Maintain Article 3 <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Then, the issue of amending the charter was discussed, and the atmosphere at the meeting immediately became tense. First, Philippine representative Arras reported on the proceedings of the two special committee meetings on the 19th, stating that all parties had engaged in friendly and open discussions but could not reach a result. It was decided that each representative would submit a separate report to the congress. The Philippine side's opinion was that Article 3 of the charter should be maintained, requiring unanimous approval from all members for the admission of new members. However, Article 10 could be amended to allow the host country to invite non-member countries to participate in competitions. The Dutch East Indies and Annam were regarded as non-member countries. Arras's report lasted fifteen minutes before it was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Hao Says the Charter Does Not Need Amendment <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Next, Chinese representative Hao Gengsheng reported, stating that the Japanese side proposed amending Article 3 of the charter to allow more new members to join. The Far Eastern Games have been established for over twenty years, and the spirit has always been good. After the passage of Article 3, two new members, the Dutch East Indies and Annam, have already joined without difficulty. Therefore, there is no problem with Article 3, and the charter does not need amendment. The Japanese proposal is particularly puzzling, he said. This lasted twelve minutes before completion.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Japanese Representatives Are At A Loss For Words <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Japanese representative Abe then spoke, reiterating that the addition of new members would make the congress even more vibrant. Furthermore, this matter is very small, so why does China insist on it? His words were extremely clumsy and devoid of reason, so he finished in only seven minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Hao Gengsheng Rebukes Him Sharply <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng rose again to refute the Japanese representative's remarks, stating that the admission of new members is not hindered by the charter. Since the Japanese side claims that amending the charter is a trivial matter, then why propose it and why insist on it?</p>
<h3 id="e214">We Do Not Agree to Participation in Competitions <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Shen Siliang stated that he agreed with the Philippine representative Arras's proposal to maintain Article 3. However, amending Article 10 to allow non-member countries to participate in competitions seems to violate the principle of Article 3 of the charter, and China cannot agree to it.</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Chairman Proposes a Temporary Recess <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Vargas proposed a temporary recess of several minutes for Hao Gengsheng, Arras, and Abe to hold another meeting. The three representatives consulted for about ten minutes before reconvening.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Our Side Opposes Holding a Vote <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Vargas advocated holding a vote on the Philippine proposal. Shen Siliang solemnly declared his opposition, stating that if Article 10 is amended, it would completely contradict the purpose of Article 3. Furthermore, the Japanese side's purpose in proposing to amend Article 3 is to increase membership. If the Philippine proposal is adopted, wouldn't the Dutch East Indies and Annam, which have already been recognized as members, be turned into non-members? This is completely inconsistent with both the principles of justice and the spirit of amending the charter.</p>
<h3 id="e217">A Minority Should Not Oppress the Majority <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, even if other articles are amended, they must be passed by a two-thirds majority of all members. Currently, only three member states are present. China has already opposed the amendment. If the Philippines and Japan agree to the amendment, only two members agree, which means that a minority is oppressing the majority, completely violating the spirit of the charter. China absolutely cannot bear this responsibility, Shen concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Our Proposal to Submit to the World Congress <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Abe spoke in favor of Arras's proposal. Vargas again intended to hold a vote. Shen Siliang stood up again to object, speaking eloquently with a strong attitude and sufficient reasoning. He also proposed that the issue of amending the charter be submitted to the World Sports Congress for resolution, or that a separate committee to amend the charter be convened for discussion at the next Games.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Our Country's Representatives Withdraw En Masse <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side expressed opposition. Our country's representatives were greatly angered and stated that if the meeting insisted on amending the charter passed by all members with the agreement of a minority, China could not bear this responsibility and could only withdraw from today's meeting to demonstrate its support for the spirit of the charter. Shen also stated that China would still invite all countries to participate in the next Games in Shanghai. After speaking, all of our representatives withdrew at 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Japanese and Philippine Parties Hold Private Meetings <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Japan and the Philippines continued to meet for one hour and resolved: (1) Article 10 of the Far Eastern Athletic Association charter, as proposed by Arras, should be amended. The championship competitions of the Far Eastern Games are limited to amateur athletes from member associations and countries permitted to participate. (2) If China is unable to host the next Games, they will be held in Tokyo. (3) A meeting will be convened next year to discuss the charter and matters related to the next Games.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Extremely Absurd: The Philippines' Compromise Proposal. Maintain Article 3, Amend Article 10. Non-Member Countries May Participate in Exhibitions. <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 20th) The regular congress, which was on the verge of collapse, convened at the Columbia Club at 10:30 AM today. Today was the second day of the congress. The Dutch East Indies had already returned home yesterday and were therefore absent today. First, the report of the Constitutional Committee from last night was presented. This was to make the Japanese proposal to amend the constitution an addendum to the constitution. Therefore, Japanese committee member Abe immediately stated that the amendment to the constitution was not an addendum and requested a correction, which was acknowledged by the entire congress. Following the review of the committee report, Dr. Vargas first declared, "Before discussing the constitutional issue, I hope to discuss the technical issues." The proposal was unanimously supported. The technical committee reported:</p>
<p>1.  The organization of the competition committee shall be irrespective of nationality.</p>
<p>2.  Track and field athletics will continue with the three championship systems of track, field, and all-around. The 5000-meter race will be included in the track events.</p>
<p>3.  The 3000-meter steeplechase will be included in the all-around competition and will be held on the second day of the competition. The decision was passed without objection. Reports from the swimming, basketball, volleyball, and football committees were also presented. At 12:40 PM, the constitutional issue was finally addressed. First, Philippine committee member Arras of the Constitutional Committee reported on the proceedings of the Constitutional Committee last night, stating that due to differences of opinion, the committee's report could not be produced. The amendment proposed by Japan was to abolish the clause in Article 3 that requires unanimous approval for the admission of new members and to add clauses stating that it should be based on a two-thirds majority of those attending the congress or the unanimous agreement of the executive committee. After a break, the meeting reconvened. The Philippines proposed another amendment, that Article 3 of the constitution, which stipulates that all must vote unanimously to admit new member countries, need not be amended. However, Article 10 should be amended to allow sovereign countries outside the member countries to be invited to the congress on behalf of a generation of coordination between China and Japan regarding the frontal conflict over Article 3. Japan supported the new Philippine proposal, but the Chinese side strongly opposed and refuted the Philippine proposal, stating that according to the Far Eastern Athletic Association League rules, amending the constitution requires a two-thirds vote of all representatives at the regular congress. Now that the Dutch East Indies have returned home and Annam is not present, it does not reach two-thirds, and they strongly rejected it. Regarding the Japanese and Philippine proposals, both Japan and the Philippines reiterated that the so-called two-thirds refers to two-thirds of those attending the congress, which is obviously sufficient. Thereupon, the Chinese side, because it needed to argue again, said that China absolutely opposes it. Although the competition in progress will continue to participate, but the matter has come to this, there is no need to stay in the congress, and the Chinese side left together. The meeting was then held only by Japan and the Philippines. The Japanese side then requested a decision on the amendment to Article 3, but was rejected by the Philippines. As a result, the amendment to Article 10 in the Philippine proposal was passed without objection. Furthermore, at the eleventh congress in 1938, the Chinese side had proposed to hold the meeting in Shanghai. However, given the current situation, it is possible that China may withdraw from the Far Eastern Congress, so Japan requested that the 1938 congress be held in Japan. The Philippines replied that since the Chinese side had made a request first, it was difficult to change it. If the central government does not implement the request to hold the meeting in Shanghai, then the meeting can be held in Japan. Japan had no choice but to agree. Furthermore, since other amendments still need to be reviewed, it was decided to convene a temporary congress at the end of this year or in the spring of next year and adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Illegally Passed: Our Country Resolutely Opposes. The Agreement of Two-Thirds of All Members Should Include Annam and the Dutch East Indies. <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 20th) After the report of Philippine Constitutional Committee member Arras at today's Far Eastern Athletic Association regular congress, Chinese representative Hao Gengsheng said, "According to the current constitution, the Dutch East Indies and Annam are newly joined countries, and the current constitution is not inconsistent. However, Japan has proposed amendments, and I don't know what the true constitution is." Japanese representative Abe replied, "Japan proposed the amendment for the prosperity of the congress, but the Chinese committee members opposed this clause, which is difficult to understand." Representative Hao Gengsheng elaborated in detail that the constitution has no defects. At that time, the meeting was adjourned for lunch and reconvened in the afternoon. The Philippines proposed a motion: "Do not amend Article 3 of the constitution, amend Article 10 (China, Japan, and the Philippines are full member countries, and all other countries are participating countries)." The Chinese side stated that Article 14 of the constitution states that amendments to the constitution require the consent of more than two-thirds of the representatives of the regular congress. Therefore, it should be interpreted as two-thirds of the entire group of China, Japan, the Philippines, Annam, and the Dutch East Indies. At that time, the committee members from Japan and the Philippines said, "The interpretation of two-thirds of the countries attending the congress is correct. Regardless of the rules of procedure, the principle of adopting a majority of those present is adopted to establish a principle. If the number of absentees is added, such an interpretation has never been heard before." The Chinese representative then said that he was not responsible for the decision against the constitution. Thereupon, the Chinese committee members left the chamber together, at 2:45 PM. Afterwards, only the committee members from Japan and the Philippines remained. Therefore, if the constitution is not amended, the counterfeit country will not have formal member country qualifications. Therefore, the Japanese side waited until this congress was completed before dissolving the current Far Eastern Congress and organizing a new competition association. It requested the understanding of the Philippines. The Philippine side unofficially agreed to this proposal. The various clauses decided by Japan and the Philippines today are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Article 3 of the constitution is not amended. Newly participating countries are not called full member countries, but are invited to attend and compete for the championship.</p>
<p>(1) A special congress to amend the constitution is scheduled to be held at the end of this year or in the spring of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Japanese Representative Declares Dissolution of the Congress <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(Japan United Press, Manila, 20th) The Japanese delegation, because its proposal to amend Article 3 of the charter was unsuccessful, declared the dissolution of the congress tonight.</p>
<p>A Penalty Kick Determines Fate: Our Country Wins the Football Championship</p>
<h3 id="e224">4-3: We Led 3-1 When Li Tiansheng Was Sent Off. Japan Tied 3-3, Fortunately Hui Tang Scored a Penalty. Tan Jiangbai Was the Hero of Our Team. <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Manila, 20th Dispatch) Our country won the football championship, defeating Japan 4-3 yesterday afternoon, achieving a record of three wins in three matches. In the first half, Tan Jiangbai scored consecutive goals, giving our country a 2-0 lead. After leading 3-1 in the second half, our country's key defender, Li Tiansheng, was sent off, and the situation immediately became tense. Japan took the opportunity to invade twice, tying the score at 3-3. Finally, our country's star player, Li Huitang, scored a penalty kick, defeating Japan 4-3. The match unfolded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e225">Tan Jiangbai Scores with a Header <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Japan kicked off, and our army immediately took the offensive, launching a major attack. Japan was forced to retreat and defend tenaciously. Our army besieged relentlessly. After five minutes, Liang Rongzhao sent a high ball from behind. Tan Jiangbai accurately judged the ball's trajectory, calmly jumped up, and scored the first goal.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Hui Tang Misses a Penalty <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>After scoring the first goal, the four stands erupted in cheers. Our country continued to make progress, not yielding in the slightest. While besieging in front of the goal, the Japanese team's left defender touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty. Li Huitang took the kick, but unfortunately, he used too little force, and the ball rolled along the ground. The Japanese goalkeeper caught it, which was a great pity.</p>
<h3 id="e227">The Flying General Descends from the Sky <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Continuing to persevere and apply pressure, Li Huitang intercepted the ball and sent it flying to the right. The ball went very high. Tan Jiangbai aimed at the ball and flew towards it. In the blink of an eye, Tan Jiangbai scored again. It was exactly fifteen minutes after the start of the match. Our army then took a 2-0 lead. The first half also ended.</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Japanese Army Fights Like Cornered Beasts <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>After the half-time break, the Japanese army showed some improvement and repeatedly fought like cornered beasts. After fifteen minutes, they harassed in front of the goal continuously. Huang Jiliang received the ball, but in the midst of the chaos, he threw it not far enough. The Japanese army's right inside forward lightly lifted it and kicked it in, making it 2-1.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Li Tiansheng Is Actually Sent Off <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Five minutes later, our army still had the advantage, attacking the enemy. Li Huitang kicked a high ball, which landed in the net. Although the Japanese goalkeeper jumped up to save the ball, his hand brushed against it, but it still entered the goal. Unexpectedly, at this time, our army's main defender, Li Tiansheng, was penalized by the referee for violating the rules and was sent off. After this blow, our army's defense line was greatly shaken.</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Score Is Tied at 3-3 <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army seized this opportunity, deploying all its forces. Our country was caught off guard and was actually scored against three times in five minutes. However, one of the goals was scored by hand, which the referee disallowed. After this change, a 3-3 tie was suddenly created between China and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e231">A Penalty Kick Establishes Dominance <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The situation suddenly became tense, and both sides fought to the death. Our army used all its might, pressing fiercely towards the enemy's阵. During another siege, the Japanese army's right defender was again seen touching the ball with his hand. Therefore, our team had another chance to score a penalty. Li Huitang, learning from the past, used an extremely powerful shot. The goalkeeper was helpless. As a result, our country won 4-3.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Tan Jiangbai Is the Hero <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Tan Jiangbai was the hero of our team, scoring consecutive goals in the first half.</p>
<p>His performance was the most satisfactory. Li Huitang did not show any special characteristics. The Japanese team's skills were mediocre and far inferior to ours. However, their stamina and fighting spirit were unmatched by other countries. (Central News Agency, Manila, 20th) The lineup of our team in the China-Japan football match held at 4:30 PM on the 20th was as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Li Guowei Li Huitang</p>

<p>In recent years, our country, both government and public, have been promoting physical education with all their might. Recently, under the pressure of strong neighbors, it has become even more enthusiastic, hoping to revive the nation. However, promoting physical education cannot be accomplished by empty talk, nor can it be achieved by simply holding a few sports meets. We should first earnestly study the principles of physical education and competitive training methods to make rapid progress and achieve satisfactory results. More than one hundred physical education experts across the country have jointly written "Physical Education Books," which cover all aspects of physical education principles, administration, history, architecture, gymnastics, track and field, swimming, ball games, dance, etc. It is published by the Shanghai Diligent Bookstore and is well-known throughout the country. Recently, according to the primary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, they jointly wrote "Primary School Physical Education Teaching Materials," a total of 25 volumes. With this set of the latest teaching materials, primary school physical education teachers can teach students in lower, middle, and upper grades for six years. In addition, "Diligent Physical Education Monthly" is China's only regular physical education publication, with rich text and illustrations, emphasizing both theory and technology. Special issues on primary and secondary school physical education are popular throughout the country. The eighth issue is "The 10th Far Eastern Games Special Issue, Volume 1," which has already been published. The ninth issue is the Far Eastern Games Special Issue, Volume 2, which is an essential monthly magazine for physical education instructors, athletes, and school libraries. The whole year of twelve issues is sold for only two yuan, with no domestic postage. Overseas add two yuan and two jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Tongji University's 27th Anniversary Celebration <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 27th anniversary of National Tongji University. The university held a grand celebration ceremony. The meeting was held in the university's auditorium starting at 9:00 AM, with many dignitaries present, which can be called a grand event. After the ceremony, President Weng Zhilong reported on the general situation of the university, saying that the graduates of the university over the past 27 years have gained considerable reputation in society. In the past four years, the number of students has increased from 548 to 863, and there is still a regret that the supply cannot meet the demand. As for the economic aspect, although there has been an increase every year, it is still not very generous due to the huge expenses of adding senior vocational schools, higher surveying departments, affiliated middle schools, two colleges of public health research institutes, and sending students to study abroad. Regarding the development of undertakings, the medical school, in addition to adding a public health lectureship and cooperating with hospitals in Changzhou, Jintan, and Wuxi, is preparing to add a hospital, because the Baolong Hospital is not enough to accommodate the increasing number of interns. In addition to adding a higher surveying department this year, the College of Engineering is preparing to cooperate with the Ministry of Communications to add shipbuilding, aircraft, and mechanical engineering departments to meet the needs of the country. As for the equipment aspect, the school buildings have been repaired completely after being destroyed by the January 28th Incident. However, the German donation of materials for factories and research institutes is very appreciated. In addition, the library and hydraulic research institute have been completed, but the swimming pool is still under construction. President Weng finally expressed his gratitude to the government authorities and the German consul for their various assistance to the school. After the president's report, representatives from the Party Committee gave speeches. Guests such as Cai Jimin, President of the Academia Sinica, Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education, the German Consul General, representatives from the German Alumni Association and the Tongji Alumni Association, and Huang Boqiao all gave speeches successively, with many words of encouragement, and congratulated President Weng for his talent. Then, the unveiling ceremony of the memorial碑 for the late Professor Shi Lou'na, Dean of the College of Engineering, and Professor Oteman, Dean of the Affiliated Middle School, was held. Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two-Road Railway Bureau, and Shen Junyi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, unveiled the monument with solemnity. After the ceremony and photography, President Weng led the guests to visit the research institutes and test sites of various departments. It is said that the guests praised them repeatedly.</p>

<h3 id="e278">Elaborating on Typhoid Fever (1) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Those who discuss typhoid fever invariably follow Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Cold Damage. And those who discuss the Treatise on Cold Damage cannot escape the Six Channels. In my view, the most meaningless aspect of the Treatise on Cold Damage is the Six Channels. The most preposterous aspect is the theory of the Six Channels. What are the Six Channels? Taiyang, Shaoyang, Yangming, Taiyin, Shaoyin, Jueyin. Their names first appeared in the Inner Canon's Twelve Meridians and Twelve Tendon Meridians. The meaning of their names all originated from the words of shamans and diviners. The Treatise on Absolute Essentials from the Simple Questions states: "The Emperor asked, 'What is Yangming?'" Qi Bo replied, "It is the merging of the two Yangs." The Emperor asked, "What is Jueyin?" Qi Bo replied, "It is the complete intersection of the two Yins." The Spiritual Pivot's Yin-Yang Relationship with the Sun and Moon chapter explains its meaning in detail. It states: "Yin signifies the birth of Yang in the first month. It governs the Shaoyang of the left foot. Wei signifies the sixth month. It governs the Shaoyang of the right foot. Mao signifies the second month. It governs the Taiyang of the left foot. Wu signifies the fifth month. It governs the Taiyang of the right foot. Chen signifies the third month. It governs the Yangming of the left foot. Si signifies the fourth month. It governs the Yangming of the right foot. These two Yangs combine in front, hence the name Yangming. Shen signifies the birth of Yin in the seventh month. It governs the Shaoyin of the right foot. Chou signifies the twelfth month. It governs the Shaoyin of the left foot. You signifies the eighth month. It governs the Taiyin of the right foot. Zi signifies the eleventh month. It governs the Taiyin of the left foot. Xu signifies the ninth month. It governs the Jueyin of the right foot. Hai signifies the tenth month. It governs the Jueyin of the left foot. These two Yins intersect completely, hence the name Jueyin." Ma XuanTai commented: "Taking the first, second, fifth, and sixth months as Shaoyang and Taiyang, with the third and fourth months residing within, these two Yangs combine and illuminate in front, hence the name Yangming. Taking the seventh and eighth months as the initial birth of Yin, and the eleventh and twelfth months as the initial birth of Yang, only the ninth and tenth months represent the end of Yin, hence the name Jueyin." Thus, what is referred to as Tai, Shao, etc., designates the first month as Shaoyang, the second month as Taiyang, the third month as Yangming, the sixth month as Shaoyang, the fifth month as Taiyang, the fourth month as Yangming, the seventh month as Shaoyin, the eighth month as Taiyin, the ninth month as Jueyin, the twelfth month as Shaoyin, the eleventh month as Taiyin, and the tenth month as Jueyin. However, examining the Apocryphal Texts of the Book of Changes, the winter solstice is considered the middle of the eleventh month, corresponding to the Taiyin of the foot, which aligns with the eleventh month Taiyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Lesser Cold is considered the solar term of the twelfth month, corresponding to the Taiyin of the hand, which does not align with the twelfth month Shaoyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Greater Cold is considered the middle of the twelfth month, corresponding to the Shaoyin of the foot, which aligns with the twelfth month Shaoyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Beginning of Spring is considered the solar term of the first month, corresponding to the Shaoyang of the foot, which aligns with the first month Shaoyang in the Spiritual Pivot. Rain Water is considered the solar term of the first month, corresponding to the Shaoyang of the hand, which aligns with the first month Shaoyang in the Spiritual Pivot. However, Zheng commented that it should correspond to the Taiyang of the hand in terms of the meridian, which does not align with the Spiritual Pivot. Startling of Insects is considered the solar term of the second month, corresponding to the Taiyang of the foot, which aligns with the second month and Yang in the Spiritual Pivot. Spring Equinox is considered the middle of the second month, corresponding to the Taiyang of the hand, which aligns with the second month Taiyang in the Spiritual Pivot. Pure Brightness is considered the solar term of the third month, corresponding to the Yangming of the foot, which aligns with the third month Yangming in the Spiritual Pivot. Grain Rain is considered the middle of the third month, corresponding to the Yangming of the foot, which aligns with the third month Yangming in the Spiritual Pivot. Beginning of Summer is considered the solar term of the fourth month, corresponding to the Yangming of the hand, which aligns with the fourth month Yangming in the Spiritual Pivot. Lesser Fullness is considered the middle of the fourth month, corresponding to the Taiyang of the foot, which does not align with the fourth month Yangming in the Spiritual Pivot. Grain in Ear is considered the solar term of the fifth month, corresponding to the Taiyang of the foot, which aligns with the fifth month Taiyang in the Spiritual Pivot. Summer Solstice is said to be the middle of the fifth month, corresponding to the Yang pulse of the hand. According to the example of the Spiritual Pivot, it should be Taiyang. However, the allocation in the Apocryphal Texts of the Book of Changes does not entirely align with the Spiritual Pivot. Therefore, what is referred to as the Yang pulse, it is unknown which Yang it refers to. Lesser Heat is considered the solar term of the sixth month, corresponding to the Yangming of the foot, which does not align with the sixth month Shaoyang in the Spiritual Pivot. Greater Heat is considered the middle of the sixth month, corresponding to the Shaoyang of the hand, which aligns with the sixth month Shaoyang in the Spiritual Pivot. Beginning of Autumn is considered the solar term of the seventh month, corresponding to the Shaoyang of the foot, which does not align with the seventh month Shaoyin in the Spiritual Pivot. End of Heat is considered the middle of the seventh month, corresponding to the Taiyin of the hand, which does not align with the seventh month Shaoyin in the Spiritual Pivot. White Dew is considered the solar term of the eighth month, corresponding to the Taiyin of the foot, which aligns with the eighth month Taiyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Autumn Equinox is considered the middle of the eighth month, corresponding to the Shaoyang of the hand, which does not align with the eighth month Taiyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Cold Dew is considered the solar term of the ninth month, corresponding to the Jueyin of the foot, which aligns with the ninth month Jueyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Frost's Descent is considered the middle of the ninth month, corresponding to the Jueyin of the foot, which aligns with the ninth month Jueyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Beginning of Winter is considered the solar term of the tenth month, corresponding to the Shaoyang of the hand, which does not align with the tenth month Jueyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Lesser Snow is considered the middle of the tenth month, corresponding to the Pericardium meridian. The Pericardium is the Jueyin of the hand, which aligns with the tenth month Jueyin in the Spiritual Pivot. Greater Snow is considered the solar term of the eleventh month, corresponding to the Hand Pericardium, which does not align with the eleventh month Taiyin in the Spiritual Pivot. This discusses things in terms of the value of the month. Its reasoning has no root, and its numbers are all different. It can be known that it cannot be relied upon.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Dedicated to Young and Future Mothers (4) <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Dashi</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, cod liver oil, calcium, vitamins, and exposure to sunlight can be applied for a considerable amount of time in order to allow the baby's bones to develop adequately.</p>
<p>XXXXX</p>
<p>In terms of various senses, the infant's sense of taste develops earliest, and they understand the condition of the food that passes through their mouths first. Therefore, mothers should be careful about things that infants can easily get their hands on and should not give sharp objects to children to play with.</p>
<p>The infant's sense of hearing is not fully developed. After two months, we sometimes see the infant's head turning in the direction of the sound.</p>
<p>A baby, if healthy, will begin to smile after two months. Between six and eight months, we can hear the infant's babbling sounds. Between nine and ten months, they will be able to call out "Papa! Mama!" These are the words that adults are looking forward to hearing. Once they pass their first birthday, they will be able to recognize words.</p>
<p>By the age of two, the infant's ability to speak has developed considerably. At this point, parents should no longer speak to them in childish "baby talk," but should speak formally to make it easier for the children to forget their incomprehensible "baby talk."</p>
<p>I know that every infant's mother wants to know about teething, so I will write down what we have personally observed here:</p>
<p>The average infant sprouts their first tooth in the sixth month, and then one tooth each month thereafter, so that by the second year they should have twenty teeth.</p>
<p>At this time, calcium should be prepared in the infant's diet.</p>
<p>Infants should have adequate exercise every day. Because legitimate exercise not only makes breathing easier and increases digestive power, but also helps development, corrects posture, and achieves good movement.</p>
<p>Infants can begin indoor gymnastics after four months. Mothers should try to make their children interested in gymnastics, singing songs or doing other movements while performing gymnastics.</p>
<p>The duration of gymnastics should initially be only five minutes, gradually increasing to fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Gymnastics must not be performed just before or shortly after meals, otherwise it will consume digestive power.</p>
<p>During gymnastics, the infant must be awake and not too hungry. In short, the most important thing is to have a set time, and to put clothes on him immediately after the exercise so that he does not catch a cold.</p>
<p>Before starting gymnastics, it is best to consult a doctor and get his guidance.</p>
<p>XXXXX</p>
<p>Finally, I want to make mothers aware of some of the laws they should know in case of unexpected dangers to their little darlings.</p>
<p>If a mother finds that her child is very uncomfortable, she should first put him in bed and then measure his temperature.</p>
<p>If the temperature is very high, a cloth (or towel) soaked in hot water can be wrapped around the upper body, which will be effective.</p>
<p>Sometimes the infant's throat should also be noted, as many diseases often arise from there. Cuts or other minor injuries to the skin should be dabbed with iodine and then wrapped in a bandage. In case of burns, use lime water or cottonseed oil to wrap.</p>
<p>In the case of cramps or convulsions, first lay the child down, and then cover the head and chest with a cold cloth.</p>
<p>In case of foreign objects being swallowed by the child,</p>
<p>or getting into the ears or nose, a doctor should be consulted immediately.</p>
<p>I hope that the above opinions and methods will at least be of some use and help to young and future parents. (The End)</p>
<p>Note: "Kilocalorie" is a medical term for measuring heat.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Regarding "Ideal Medical Association" Response to Mr. Pang and Mr. Chen <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Since I published the article "Ideal Medical Association" in this journal, Mr. Pang Jingzhou provided "further interpretation" of my humble article, and Mr. Chen Fangzhi even added a stern "review." I, being ignorant and simple-minded, have not been able to deeply understand the ways of the world. I believe that the lack of progress in the Chinese medical community in recent years is due to the divergent opinions of various factions. A medical association is an organization that represents the entire medical community, and what is called the national general medical association is like the central government of a country. A government cannot have two, so how can a medical association have three? Therefore, I advocated the union of the three associations in order to achieve the effect of unified authority. When power can be concentrated, it will naturally have more than enough resources to deal with internal and external affairs. I speak from the heart, and there is no so-called background. Moreover, since it is called "ideal," it is not yet certain whether it will become a reality. Although I have been practicing medicine for many years, I seem to have done nothing more than teach and treat patients. Therefore, I dare not claim to be able to understand the inside story of the medical community deeply. What I know, others also know. And as for the three major medical associations, I have no relationship with them whatsoever, and I am in a different field than those who manage them. Therefore, I dare to take the position of a fourth party, represent the opinions of ordinary colleagues, and publish the article "Ideal Medical Association." "Without desires, one is firm," as the ancient saying goes. The merits of my humble opinion are to be judged by the public, but I am deeply confident in my "desirelessness." Now, after reading Mr. Pang's article, I realize that what I said only followed the popular view, that there are no factions within the medical community, and that unity is not difficult. Therefore, I was overjoyed and knew that my previous belief that unity was not easy was just a杞人憂天杞人憂天's worry. Before I could finish celebrating, Mr. Chen's article came out. After repeatedly reading it, I realized that not only are there divisions between factions within the medical community, but also that opinions are like fire and water, and that unity will never be possible. Then, I could not help but feel sad and know that those who have been working hard for unity are like the Foolish Old Man moving mountains. The mountain cannot be moved, but if you insist on moving it, this is why the Wise Old Man of Hebei laughed and left. Mr. Chen is a senior in the medical community and has been in politics for many years. Using his experience in politics, he infers the situation of the medical community. Seeing that the political situation has not been unified in the past 20 years, he anticipates that the medical community cannot be united. This kind of insight is different from those of us who only know the superficial aspects. Therefore, he expressed his honest opinion and enlightened me. This is what I should thank Mr. Chen for. As for saying that what I said seems to have a background, and that the idea of unity is equal to eliminating dissidents, I am a pure doctor, with no political skills and no factions to speak of. Then what do I love and hate, that I must flatter one party and make enemies with another? This is what I want to declare to Mr. Chen.</p>

<p>(29) Epidemic Dysentery</p>
<p>(Question) What is epidemic dysentery?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a dangerous diarrheal disease that specifically attacks children aged three to six during the summer and autumn.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>(Question) What is its cause?</p>
<p>(Answer) The cause is unclear, but it seems to be similar to dysentery bacteria or E. coli.</p>
<p>(Question) Why are children susceptible to epidemic dysentery?</p>
<p>(Answer) The contributing factors are eating indigestible fruits and candies, drinking excessive cold drinks, and being exposed to cold while sleeping at night.</p>
<p>(Question) Why is this disease dangerous?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because epidemic dysentery can cause severe toxic symptoms in sick children.</p>
<p>(Question) After infection, before the onset of the disease, is there an incubation period?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is an incubation period of several hours to twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the initial symptoms of the disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) The child suddenly loses strength, becomes inactive, and lies quietly.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms when the disease breaks out?</p>
<p>(Answer) The body temperature rises (fever) to 38 to 39 degrees Celsius: at the same time, two or three foul-smelling soft stools or diarrhea are discharged. The stool contains undigested matter and mucus. Soon, the body temperature rises further to 40 to 41 degrees. The nature of the stool is mucus and blood, without tenesmus (straining) or feeling of incomplete evacuation, and it can occur dozens of times a day. In addition, vomiting may occur at the onset, with brownish or coffee-ground-like substances being vomited. The stool also contains black things. These are all from bleeding in the digestive tract that has turned black.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the abdominal symptoms?</p>
<p>(Answer) The child's abdomen is slightly sunken, soft, and often has abdominal sounds and tenderness to the touch.</p>
<p>(Question) What other symptoms are there?</p>
<p>(Answer) Other symptoms include drowsiness, convulsions, rapid and weak pulse, pale skin, cold limbs, and a pale face, leading to death.</p>
<p>(Question) How long does the most severe stage last?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most severe stage lasts twelve to twenty-four hours, leading to death from cardiac paralysis.</p>
<p>(Question) What happens in milder cases?</p>
<p>(Answer) In milder cases, the body temperature drops within one or two days, and various symptoms gradually disappear, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there even milder cases?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are also cases where there are only a few episodes of diarrhea, a mild fever, or the discharge of a few stools containing mucus, and then it stops. These symptoms resemble ordinary gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>(Question) How is it diagnosed?</p>
<p>(Answer) Whenever a child suddenly loses strength, is tired, and lies down, this disease should be suspected. If there is a high fever, vomiting, toxic symptoms, mucus in the stool, but no tenesmus, then this disease can definitely be diagnosed.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the degree of danger after the prognosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The younger the age, the more dangerous it is. Obese children are worse off than thin children. The mortality rate is twenty to thirty percent.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for epidemic dysentery?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is the same as for ordinary dysentery. Special attention should be paid to the heart, and cardiotonics are often used. If there are toxic symptoms, physiological saline, etc., must be injected.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the preventive measures?</p>
<p>(Answer) They are the same as for dysentery, which is to disinfect the patient's feces and prohibit the consumption of uncooked, indigestible, and unclean food. Pay attention to the cleanliness of drinks, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e282">The Treatment of Leprosy <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Mingqiang</p>
<p>The International Leprosy Conference was held in Manila, Philippines, on January 9, 1931. Most of the participants were experienced physicians from various countries engaged in leprosy work, totaling more than twenty people. The conference lasted for two weeks, which was an unprecedented grand event in the medical field. All the resolutions were published in the Philippine Journal of Science. Subsequently, the Wood Memorial Fund for the Eradication of Leprosy in New York printed one thousand copies and distributed them to major medical organizations around the world. This article is translated from the chapter on treatment in the conference's resolution report. I hope readers will not treat it lightly. —Translator</p>
<p>The treatment of leprosy must be carried out with both general therapy and specific therapy in order to be effective. Moreover, these therapies must vary according to each individual patient and cannot be applied uniformly.</p>
<p>(1) General Therapy The general therapy for leprosy is roughly similar to that used for other chronic infectious diseases. However, most physicians with experience in this disease believe that diseases that impair resistance must be avoided by leprosy patients as much as possible, which is an important key to effective treatment. Furthermore, proper management of the quality and quantity of food is also quite important. Other factors such as personal hygiene, appropriate exercise, mental well-being, and light work all have considerable value in treatment and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>(2) Specific Therapy All procedures concerning treatment and attempts to eliminate disease areas can be called specific therapy, such as the application of drugs and surgery.</p>
<p>The most widely used drug is chaulmoogra oil and its various preparations. The most commonly used oils are named Hydnoocarpus Wightiana and H. anthelmintioa (both of which belong to the chaulmoogra family and are the best of this class). Among the preparations of these oils, the most noteworthy for treatment are the ethyl esters and sodium salts of fatty acids. From a clinical point of view, these oils and their various preparations are almost identical in therapeutic value. Therefore, the choice of application mostly focuses on ease of acquisition, convenience of transportation, purity of quality, and permanence of preservation.</p>
<p>Ethyl esters are widely used in major treatment centers and are favored by those engaged in leprosy treatment everywhere. The reason for this is that the manufacturing process of this drug enables each product to be fixed, uniform, and have a certain standard. Moreover, the lack of local reaction during injection is superior to other preparations. Furthermore, this reaction can be reduced by adding five parts per thousand of iodine. Some physicians prefer to use pure oil and sodium salts of fatty acids. Although these drugs can be used for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, the effect of intradermal injection is not as good as ethyl esters, so it is rarely tried.</p>
<p>Injection methods include intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, and intravenous. The method of selection should be determined by the nature of the drug. For example, pure oil is not suitable for intradermal injection, and ethyl esters are better; and pure oil and ethyl esters are not suitable for intravenous injection, etc., all of which must be paid attention to. Moreover, skin lesions can often be easily dissipated by intradermal injection. As for the amount of various drugs used, there is no fixed standard and it must be determined according to the patient's tolerance.</p>
<p>There are also several other Hydnocarpus-like oil agents used. However, the experience gained is not yet sufficient to evaluate its value.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the patient's recovery, controllable febrile reactions are often adopted. Physical therapies such as ultraviolet light, radiant heat, and hot baths are all very beneficial to leprosy patients.</p>
<p>Other drugs such as gold preparations and other heavy metal preparations have also been tried, but must be very careful. Iodides are not very suitable for most patients. Based on experience, this type of drug can only be used for patients who are physically strong and have a high tolerance for chaulmoogra-like preparations.</p>
<p>Standards for Treatment and Assessment It is not yet time to obtain a standard treatment method at present. The most satisfying method is intradermal injection of Hydnoocarpus oils. At the same time, it can be used in combination with intramuscular injection. Leprosy is a chronic disease, so the effectiveness of the methods and drugs used in treatment must be determined one or several years after application. Moreover, there is currently no accurate method to assess the value of treatment. Clinical and microscopic examinations are often erroneous and cannot be performed without skilled surgery, trained personnel, and careful examination.</p>
<h3 id="e283">On the Treatment of Syphilis (Can 606, 914 Completely Cure Syphilis?) (Part Two) <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Gong</p>
<p>(3) Bismuth preparations. The application of bismuth in the treatment of syphilis began in recent years. However, it is mostly used as an auxiliary drug in combination therapy rather than used alone. Compared with the efficacy of arsenic, bismuth, and mercury, various reports are inconsistent.</p>
<p>Arsenic nine: Bismuth seven: Mercury five (Frieboes)</p>
<p>Arsenic ten: Bismuth seven: Mercury four (Milian)</p>
<p>Arsenic ten: Bismuth six: Mercury four (Gougerot)</p>
<p>However, Brocq said that the efficacy of bismuth is not greater than that of mercury.</p>
<p>(4) Iodine preparations. Iodine preparations are weakly effective in the first stage of syphilis. However, in the later stage, the effect is quite large. Iodine preparations only take effect after being decomposed in the body. There are also two methods of administration: injection and oral administration. However, side effects are also unavoidable.</p>
<p>Drugs can cure diseases, but they can also kill people. Therefore, proper handling is the dividing point between medical skills. The question of whether syphilis can be completely cured is still controversial and there is no consensus. In short, if patients can receive appropriate treatment early, the results will be fast and sure. Therefore, the issue of seeking medical attention after being infected with syphilis is quite different. The application of drugs is valuable in that it has a hierarchy. For example, in the first stage of syphilis, the main treatment is injection of arsenic preparations, combined with bismuth preparations or mercury therapy. In the second stage, mercury or bismuth preparations should be used first. After two or three weeks, arsenic preparations should be injected again. In the third stage, iodine preparations can be used to remove rashes. However, complete treatment also relies on arsenic, bismuth, and mercury preparations. In patients with internal organ or neurosyphilis, treatment with iodine, bismuth, and mercury should be done first. Then, arsenic preparations can be injected slowly. Therefore, patients often think that they have been cured after ten injections. In fact, there is often regret that they want to be fast but fail to achieve it. Curing diseases is valuable in that it treats the root cause. If only the appearance is taken into account, it will turn out to be a clumsy attempt and lead to so-called latent syphilis. Latent syphilis means that there are no signs of syphilis on the outside, but the blood still shows a positive reaction. If more people suffer from latent syphilis, there will be more opportunities for heredity. And the number of congenital syphilis patients will also increase accordingly. The treatment is more troublesome and not as straightforward as in the early stage after infection. At this time, the world is in recession, and the Chinese people are especially poor. Under the difficulties of food and clothing, the number of people who cannot receive appropriate treatment is countless. There are also occasional wealthy families who are confused by advertisements and misled by quack doctors. This is because they only know the properties of 606 and 914 drugs, but do not know the situation after the drug properties enter the body. Nowadays, doctors often use people's psychology to use their stupidity to lure patients by using a quick cure as bait. Those who are deceived by them do not realize it in the end. It is lamentable. Here, I cannot help but loudly shout that syphilis should first pay attention to prevention. Second, a setback therapy should be performed early. Third, long-term combination therapy must be received. Woe to this sight full of sores. Do not be confused by the false claims of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e284">A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (5) <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Inducing Factors for the Occurrence of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Now that tuberculosis bacteria have reached the trachea or lungs, does that mean that pulmonary tuberculosis will immediately develop? This is also not certain. The formation of ordinary pulmonary tuberculosis involves two conditions. The first is the "external cause," which is how tuberculosis bacteria invade the human body, as mentioned in the transmission routes above. The second is the inducing factor. What is meant by an inducing factor? We must understand that each person's physical adaptation status is different: in other words, the degree of resistance is different for everyone. As mentioned in the airborne transmission above, tuberculosis bacteria can invade the human body anytime and anywhere when they are scattered in the dust in the air: so no matter who it is, one or two tuberculosis bacteria always enter the trachea in a day. In this case, wouldn't everyone become a pulmonary tuberculosis patient? But in fact, it will never be like this. Ordinary healthy people have resistance to eliminate invading bacteria: even if the bacteria are unfortunately successful, sometimes only minor local changes occur, and not everyone spreads into a disease, forming what is generally called (clinically provable) the disease itself. But if the body is weak, the resistance is weak, and there are congenital and acquired defects, then it is of course not the same as the former and it is easy to form. This easy-to-form state is the "inducing factor" presented in this chapter. What are the inducing factors of pulmonary tuberculosis? The most important of these is of course what is commonly called the consumptive constitution. People who have this kind of constitution are generally: narrow face, long neck, narrow chest, ribs sloping downward, deep hollows in the supraclavicular fossa, slender hands and feet, and poor development of muscles and fat. His appearance is weak, his complexion is pale, his teeth are neat, his inspiratory muscles are weak, and his heart and vascular system are easily excited. Such a physique is very easy to develop tuberculosis. The reason for this is mostly congenital.</p>
<p>The apex of the lung is also the easiest place to form tuberculosis infection. Because the respiratory movement of the apex of the lung is relatively weak, and its gas exchange is less than that of other parts of the lung: if tuberculosis bacteria and dust reach the apex of the lung, it is difficult to remove them from there. In addition, the blood supply to the apex of the lung is also less than that of other parts of the lung. This situation is very beneficial for the formation and progression of tuberculosis. Whether or not pulmonary tuberculosis is easily formed is also related to age. Generally, the number of cases is highest in those over eighteen and under thirty: there are also many children. In those over forty, there are relatively fewer cases, and even if there are, the progression of the disease is mostly chronic. But in the elderly around sixty years old, obvious cases are also quite a few. In terms of gender statistics, there are more men than women, which is of course because there are more opportunities for contact infection.</p>
<p>Regarding people's environment, place of residence, place of work, past acute illnesses, and various chronic diseases; all of these are very related to the occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Like living in a humid place where sunlight and air do not circulate, working in a closed factory all day long, and in dirty air: or because of the backward economic situation, the three meals a day are not complete, and the lack of nutritious food is even more likely. These situations can all promote the formation of pulmonary tuberculosis. In terms of disease, diseases such as diabetes, typhoid fever, whooping cough, measles, chronic bronchitis, and bronchopneumonia can all weaken people's body resistance: and of course, they are also a great help to the occurrence or progression of pulmonary tuberculosis. Regarding congenital pulmonary artery stenosis and blood loss from the lungs, these two conditions can also be regarded as inducing factors for tuberculosis. But I think the reason for this is too biased towards academic theory and cannot be understood by people who have not studied medicine, so I will not discuss it here.

<h3 id="e285">Correction of the Name of Cholera <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The name "Zhendan" originated from Buddhist books, and the name "Zhina" originated from Japan. In essence, they all refer to China, but the Chinese people use them without careful consideration. They use foreign transliterations to replace our original characters. Therefore, saying "stupa" for pagoda and "bhikkhu" for monk is already the case in ancient books and cannot be changed. However, it is not as bad as it is in modern times.</p>
<p>Since the eastward transmission of Western culture, new medicine has become increasingly developed, causing a huge shock. As a result, many medical terms have been transliterated, but their errors are quite alarming. Some deviate in pronunciation, and some deviate in meaning. They follow foreign translations without asking what the true meaning is. Scholars advocate it, and the common people agree with it. For decades, no one has realized it. Although the government has reviewed and approved it, the errors still persist after the review and approval. It is assumed that since it has been used for a long time, it has become a habit, and it is inconvenient to change it once. Then how can there be a revolutionary spirit? If, although it has been reviewed and approved, this has not been seen, then the reviewers are also difficult to exonerate from the responsibility of acting hastily! In the past, I once said that the character "jia" in thyroid should be changed to "dun." "Jia" is armor, and "dun" is a weapon for defending against soldiers. To say "dun" is to deeply understand its shape, and to say "jia" is to have no direction to point to. The Japanese say that "dun" is "jia," so it is not an error to use it. In our country, "jia" and "dun" are already distinguished, so their shapes are different. Continuing to use it without changing it is a great mistake! As for typhoid, it is the transliteration of the Western name Typhus Abdom. The Japanese read "zhi" as "chi," so it matches the pronunciation. Our country reads "zhi" as "zhi su qie," which is a deviation in pronunciation. It is only because the Japanese translated it first, and we follow it later, without any independent opinion, and we say what others say. This is why Japan wants to have China. I have examined the disease "cholera." It originated in Asia. The English, French, and German countries all call cholera Cholera. The Japanese medical community translates the sound of Cholera as "torareera," and the etymology of the word Cholera has not yet been determined. Some say it comes from Greek, meaning "bile flow" or "ditch diarrhea," and some say it comes from Latin, meaning "evil disease." There are various opinions, and there is no consensus. What is certain is that it is not an ancient European term.</p>
<p>What is even more advanced is that the three names "cholera" and "torareera" have different characters, but their pronunciations are actually similar. Since the original character of torareera is Cholera, then the word Cholera seems to be undoubtedly the transliteration of cholera. Therefore, when it comes to the source of the disease, it was born in East Asia, and when it comes to the ancestor of the term, it came from China. Now, we abandon the established name containing meaning and follow the Japanese translation that has sound but no meaning, translating each other, and the true meaning is completely lost. Our Chinese people have intensified and abbreviated it as "tiger plague," as if there is a so-called big insect plague in addition to rat plague. Nothing is more laughable than this. The new generation of scholars know the name of torareera but do not know cholera. Is this not what is called forgetting one's ancestors? If the slave nature is not changed, independence is difficult to achieve. Medical terms are the most trivial, but the expression of a spirit of worshiping foreigners is already complete! Correcting it is also the responsibility of those who care about the world and people's hearts. What do you gentlemen of the world think?</p>

<h3 id="e286">Famous Principles <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Hengsha</p>
<p>There is no lack of various great principles in the world, which sound pleasant, make beautiful articles, and are quite impressive when acted upon, but we know that they are not desirable.</p>
<p>Let's take Buddhist principles as an example. To persuade people to do good and be compassionate, aren't the teachings themselves very healthy? Generals' books may be engraved with "Buddhist disciple"; social scoundrels may also call themselves "lay Buddhists"; after scraping the land and taking concubines, they donate some money to repair Buddhist temples and print Buddhist scriptures, and thus become old-fashioned gentlemen. If you listen to wild foxes talking about Chan Buddhist principles, you feel that their principles are super-super, forgetting that they are wild foxes. Lu You has a poem that says: "Silks and embroideries show off women's work, poets cry poor here," this is what it means.</p>
<p>That principle, Zhuangzi already had the "Opening Coffers" chapter, there is no need to explain it. Stealing with both benevolence and righteousness, becoming a weapon to protect oneself, what method can be thought of? Go ask the bureaucrats, please sit down, don't be busy, he can explain it clearly. Western principles, picked up at random, say one thing in a flowery way; fighting for territory, it's to relieve the suffering of the people! Snatching jobs, it's to be unwilling to give way! If things go wrong, it's because China has no talent! Even to the point of a complete defeat, it's to retreat to advance, it's also the principle in the Book of Changes!</p>
<p>Therefore, the common people have to be silent and retreat.</p>
<p>But sometimes a rich man suddenly becomes poor, or a powerful person suddenly collapses, then the true face is revealed, neither crying nor laughing, at this time benevolence and morality are not working. Even if Buddhism says that everything is empty, it is not working, there is nothing to comfort them, so Zhuangzi also wrote the "Robber Zhi" chapter in addition to the "Opening Coffers" chapter, maybe it was fabricated by later generations, but that thinking is roughly consistent.</p>
<p>However, logic also has times of exhaustion, the principles of the Book of Changes are finally incomplete, the principles of principles have been occupied, the world still needs to change, because the common people often have no reason to talk about but are really persistent in unspeakable reasons. If the Japanese once swallowed China, we undoubtedly, the principles will go to that side again.</p>
<p>But this is still not terrible, the principle of no reason will break the principle of reason, cheating and cheating through, it is not surprising. Were the Manchus not strict in ruling the Han people in the Qing Dynasty, did not the civil and military achievements reach the extreme, but in the end there was the Republic of China, why?</p>
<h3 id="e287">Reminiscences <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Bi</p>
<p>— Written for the Third Anniversary of the Death of My Late Friend Chen Hangshu —</p>
<p>(I) On a breezy early summer evening, the sun was already hanging on the treetops, patches of wandering clouds were rolling and rippling in the sky. I, harboring a slight feeling of sadness, leaned against the window alone, lost in thought. After many memories of past reunions and separations, joys and sorrows flashed through my mind, I suddenly remembered Chen Hangshu, who passed away in France three years ago -- today happens to be the exact third anniversary -- and I suddenly felt a heavy oppression in my heart. He was an absolutely transcendent typical youth. He embodied all the virtues of mankind: he possessed unparalleled intelligence, he harbored profound cultivation, he had keen talent and exquisite skills, he could use his special intellect to observe the changes of all things, he could exert his sharp insights to cope with the arrival of all difficulties, he was not arrogant, not rigid, not cunning, not mean, always maintaining a gentle attitude to give anyone a good impression. Once we experienced his elegant style, lingering emotions, and graceful conversation, we would all unconsciously fall for him. However, it was precisely because he was too smart, too thoughtful, that he could thoroughly understand others but could not understand himself; he could use his inspiration to give comfort to others but could not get his own comfort from others. In this way, he could not avoid embarking on the road of melancholy. At the same time, he focused too much on the pursuit of learning, neglecting the care of his body, and finally died of intestinal tuberculosis before his doctoral thesis was even drafted. His death shook a part of scholars at home and abroad. Undoubtedly, this is a pity for talent, not just a private mourning. Regarding his entire learning and thought, someone should write a biography for him, so I won't go into details now. What I am constantly thinking about is some emotional fragments and connections, which I cannot help but express in writing. I was the one who knew him since he was a child. Among the few of us, he was always regarded as a little brother; however, his bright and radiant light was often regarded by us as a bright lamp in a dark room, and his warmth towards us was like adding a steam heater to a cold cellar. Now, the cold air has not dissipated, the heater has been removed first, the night is still dark, and the aura is suddenly gone. How can we not be devastated and heartbroken!</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>My first meeting with Hangshu was probably in the early years of the Republic of China. At that time, his fourth brother, Shuliang, and I were studying at the local county high school. One day, when school was dismissed, I found a child of about seven or eight years old wandering in the corridor outside the student dormitory. His delicate eyebrows, rosy cheeks, and the gentle smile that he occasionally revealed attracted the attention of many students. Later, I learned that he was Shuliang's younger brother who had come from the countryside to visit his brother, and everyone happily went to talk to him. Originally, we wanted to tease him, but unexpectedly, his conversation was very civilized and organized, unlike what a seven or eight-year-old child could say; and between questions and answers, his attitude was as generous as an adult, which naturally surprised us -- at that time, the general school age of primary school students seemed to be higher than it is now, so our classmates were mostly around fourteen or fifteen years old and could understand some worldly affairs. From that time on, he left me with an indelible impression.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>He was only fourteen years old when he entered middle school, and his excellent grades won unanimous praise from the entire school. Not only did he always win first place in every exam, but he also showed many contributions outside of schoolwork. He had special ambitions, but he didn't often talk about them casually with others. He was not like ordinary "excellent" students who studied for exams; he liked to find knowledge outside of textbooks to integrate his consistent pursuits. He disdained the high or low scores on test papers, but only suffered from the inability to satisfy himself. For always being at the top of the list, he certainly didn't have any "smugness"; on the contrary, he thought that others were looking down on him too much for complimenting him based on the list. In order to avoid the concentration of other people's attention, he tried his best to learn to be casual, doing some naughty things, and even violated the school rules and was punished; he just smiled. He was so friendly and amiable to his classmates that he maintained a considerable friendship with almost everyone, and his words were so tactful and relaxed that almost every sentence could touch the hearts of others. He was really an exquisite and ingenious person, he was really a little elf!</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>My close association with him began after the May Fourth Movement. At that time, we ran a small publication; in addition to him and me, there were also Hu Zhongchi and Mao Wuzhi. Editing, proofreading, printing, and distribution were almost all handled by us. We were extremely busy, but under mutual coordination, the work was very organized. In particular, Hangshu unfolded his skillful and impeccable skills, giving us a very enthusiastic interest. Even someone like me, who has always been lazy, was happy to engage in it under his encouragement and supervision. The writings in the publication were just some casual feelings published by us, but he often had novel ideas and fluent writing, which could be thought-provoking. I still remember that once he said in his random notes:</p>
<p>'...Occasionally walking in the suburbs, I feel that this natural beauty is really reluctant to give up. I can't help but think: if I were isolated from the world, quietly enjoying the pleasure of natural beauty, that would be a truly joyful and meaningful life! Because of this thought, I feel that the reason why we are human is simply because we are attracted by the joy in front and forced by the misery of death behind, so we go all out to be human, which shows that life is indeed manipulated by emotions.'</p>
<p>'So my judgment is: a life of emotion is active, a life of reason is passive, a life of emotion is a transcendent way, and a life of reason is an worldly way; according to biology, the instinct of life originates from the need for self-preservation, and in our current situation, we can only be satisfied with the passive worldly way.'</p>
<p>Such an admirer of transcendence coming from a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth would surprise anyone. Cuchi once said generously: 'This little brother is really beyond the reach of our group of brothers!' This sentence was unanimously recognized at the time.</p>
<p>The distribution of the publication was relatively difficult. The motivation for us to run this publication was to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of the citizens, and of course we hoped to have many readers; however, there was no funding, and printing paper cost money, so it was difficult to send it out universally. We had to start from selling it. Because there were so few subscribers, we had to brave the scorching sun, carrying the crystal of our heart's blood, and go to the streets to 'peddle' door to door. This was naturally unfamiliar to us, but we had to reluctantly engage in it. As a result of 'peddling' separately, the number of copies sold by us was often less than that sold by Hangshu, because his tactful expression easily won the sympathy of the citizens -- I often didn't sell even one copy. But later, he found that most citizens threw it away casually after buying our publication. He became very unhappy and said angrily to us: 'We have spent so much effort and energy without getting any reward, it's like receiving their alms, what's the point!' As a result of the discussion, our publication finally stopped there.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Why Do We Throw Rice at the Bride and Groom? <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In Zheng Zhenduo's translation of "Introduction to Folklore," there is a section explaining "Why do we throw rice at the bride and groom?" 'Some will say this is a blessing; rice is a symbol of abundance. The Chinese also perform the same ceremony with rice (the hostess throws rice on the bride's head as she enters her future home). Rice is a symbol of abundance.' In my opinion, this explanation is somewhat incorrect, regardless of the customs of the ancient ethnic groups of Celebes, India, and certain parts of England.</p>
<p>In our country's custom, when the bride steps out of the sedan chair, what is thrown on her is not only rice, but also tea leaves, shredded red paper, and the like. The meaning is not to bless, but to exorcise evil. The virginity of a virgin is seen as very mysterious in feudal society, and it is felt that demons are constantly taking the opportunity to cause trouble; even during this grand ceremony, the demons are desperately making a final disturbance. The groom's head is covered with a red scarf, and the sedan chair door is hung with rice stalks. The rice stalks are tied with objects such as a ten-thousand-year calendar, a copper mirror, and a tailor's ruler, forming a Bagua array to prevent demons from entering. As soon as the bride gets out of the sedan chair, tea leaves and rice are quickly sprinkled on her to make the demons stay away, so as to complete the perfect merit. The use of tea leaves and rice has the same meaning in ordinary times for driving away evil spirits and sending away stars for patients.</p>
<p>Why do tea leaves and rice have the effect of driving away evil spirits? Humans believe that things that maintain life have supreme divine power. Tea leaves quench thirst, and rice fills the stomach. Getting them means life, and losing them means death. Needless to say, they are the most powerful things in the world. By analogy, things like scales, rulers, rice sieves, and calendars, which are directly or indirectly related to maintaining life, become our guards. We cannot see or hear demons and evil spirits, so we ask these powerful guards to deal with them. The true meaning of sprinkling rice should be explained this way.</p>
<p>There is another kind of ritual text for blessing customs in marriage. On the day the bride is about to marry, from bathing, dressing, combing her hair, and wearing flowers, the elderly and senior relatives will recite blessings for her. Every time she does something, there is a blessing. From the bride's own door to the sedan chair door, her feet do not touch the ground. A rice bag is placed on the ground, passed on from person to person, called passing on the lineage. The curtains, quilts, and clothes in the room are all deeply dyed blue, wishing them love. On the wedding day, gifts are given to guests, such as melon seeds and peanuts, wishing for the continuation of their descendants.</p>
<p>These blessing rituals are completely separate from sprinkling tea leaves and rice, and they are not related or confused.</p>
<p>Someone asked: 'Bismarck once said, "People in the tropics worship the sun because the sun is dangerous and hot in the tropics; the Teutons also worship lightning for similar reasons. In these matters, human nature is revealed, which is the same as dogs, who love and respect those they fear." Isn't his explanation extremely accurate?' We should agree with his statement that worshiping the sun, fire, snakes, and reproductive worship are all simple materialist views that can be said to be the origin of theism. Believing that tea leaves and rice can drive away evil spirits has the same origin in psychology.</p>
<p>That is my explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Stimulation <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Fu</p>
<p>Behaviorists explain behavior with stimulation, saying, "All behavior is based on stimulation, but the repetition of stimulation will also reduce its intensity, until in the end, it will be so weak that it is almost numb. If the same stimulation is repeated, one will not even feel it at all." This is indeed close to the truth.</p>
<p>Love is a more complex stimulation. Some say that marriage is the tomb of love, which is probably because the stimulation of love becomes nearly saturated after marriage. If no new stimulation occurs, it is difficult for the old stimulation to evoke the old love.</p>
<p>Terror is also a non-simple stimulus. But the repetition of terror can also numb people and no longer be terror. As the saying goes: "Courage is frightened." It is not unreasonable. When young, adults often use monsters and tigers to scare them. At first, they are indeed a little afraid, but after hearing about them for a long time, they no longer believe them. A person who travels at night will inevitably be worried at first, seeing gods and ghosts. People who are accustomed to walking at night have more stimulation and find night travel more interesting.</p>
<p>The first time I saw a beheading, I felt it was a bit scary. I ran away before I really saw it clearly. Later, because I had the opportunity to see beheadings every day, it became commonplace. When my own friend was killed, I could even help others identify the body from the corpse pile, which was really unexpected before.</p>
<p>In short, the repetition of stimulation can change its nature, which is a truth. Therefore, mothers who use terror tactics to scare their children, although it can be used for a while, will eventually make the children bolder and give birth to a contemptuous and untrustworthy mood for the elders.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Eugenie (5) <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>On the first day in Berlin, it was drizzling slightly. In the morning, they visited several museums for a while. Eugenie felt a little unwell, so she stayed in the hotel in the afternoon.</p>
<p>'I feel a bit strange. Shall we go visit a doctor?' Eugenie said.</p>
<p>'Okay, let's go.'</p>
<p>They found a doctor on Kant Street. Eugenie spoke in German for a while. The doctor nodded frequently, but Xuan didn't understand a word. Then, Eugenie was led to the inner room and came out after a few minutes. Eugenie asked Xuan to pay the consultation fee, and they returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>'Darling, I'm pregnant!' Eugenie said with a mischievous expression as soon as she entered the room.</p>
<p>'Really?' This was a bolt from the blue for Xuan.</p>
<p>'Of course it's true, the doctor just confirmed it.' She sat down next to Xuan, and Xuan put his arms around her waist. She said coquettishly: 'When I was preparing for the exam, you kept asking me... I was lazy, I skipped those preventive measures. My body has been a little different for the past half a month; it turned out to be this!'</p>
<p>'Darling, did you ask about the methods of termination?' Xuan asked worriedly.</p>
<p>'What do you ask that for?'</p>
<p>'Aren't you going to terminate this little life that came wrong? This little life that we can't keep!'</p>
<p>'Why do you say such things? To be honest, I'm happy about it! Didn't you say that our love doesn't have any fitting souvenirs? Now, isn't the souvenir coming on its own? Is there any more fitting souvenir than this? Now you're saying we can't keep it!'</p>
<p>'It can be kept... You have to sacrifice your family and go back to Paris with me! That way, we can keep this little life!'</p>
<p>'Darling, forgive me: on this point, my opinion is different from yours again. Now I'm going home. First, this fait accompli will facilitate our marriage; second, my mother can take care of me and our child. Do you think you can understand women's affairs?'</p>
<p>'As you said before, since your mother is so proud, how can she tolerate her unmarried daughter giving birth to a child?'</p>
<p>'These are two different things! The factors involved are completely different. It's like my giving birth and marrying you. The attitude of the church towards these two things is completely different. I have better ways to deal with my family. — In short, I don't want to sacrifice the crystallization of our love! I still want to go home. Next March or April, after I give birth, I will take the earliest opportunity to bring the child to Paris to find you. Don't you like it?'</p>
<p>'I like it,' Xuan replied helplessly. He knew Eugenie's stubborn temper; he understood the maternal love in a woman's nature; he was convinced of women's innate ability to deal with such difficulties, and he had nothing else to say. He thought about it from the opposite perspective: maybe because of this new life, the current separation won't be forever! With this bridge, Eugenie can belong to him forever! He felt at ease again.</p>
<p>They toured Berlin for a few more days as if on a honeymoon, and Eugenie prepared to take the train south. The first night, they told each other countless words and made countless vows! The next day, this eternally elegant and graceful girl waved goodbye with a bitter smile in the train window and was taken away by the train! Xuan's tears fell like strings.</p>
<p>Hurriedly leaving Berlin, that sad place, Xuan returned to Paris alone. Recalling this beautiful dream of the past two years, he was immersed in an unnamed melancholy and anxiety! Every night, his dream soul struggled to follow the flow of the Danube eastward!</p>
<p>May the God of Love bless the holy Eugenie and the little life she is carrying! (End)</p>

<p>Comments on the National Financial Conference Amidst the Noise</p>
<h3 id="e291">Two Proposals by the Ministry of Finance for Reorganizing Land Tax <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhipan</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance convened a national financial conference, which opened today in Beijing. Financial authorities from various provinces were summoned to discuss practical and important issues such as the reorganization of land tax, the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and the preparation of local budgets. It is reported that this conference will particularly emphasize the discussion of reorganizing land tax. The Ministry of Finance has already drafted two proposals and, before submitting them to the conference, seeks the opinions of authorities and local figures in various provinces, hoping to gather diverse perspectives. This spirit of humility and dedication to governance is truly admirable. Having examined county finances for many years, I have some understanding of the long-standing abuses in land tax. After reading the two proposals of the Ministry of Finance on reorganizing land tax, I deeply feel that they address the current malpractices and are concise and to the point. According to the Ministry of Finance, the two proposals to be submitted to the conference are: one is a plan to conduct land reporting, and the other is a strategy to alleviate surcharges in order to revitalize the rural economy. In addition to providing detailed measures, both proposals analyze in detail the current abuses in land tax and the causes of rural economic bankruptcy. The original text of these two proposals is recorded at the beginning of this article for reference:</p>
<p>Proposal (1)</p>
<p>Proposal to Conduct Land Reporting Prior to Reorganizing Land Tax to Eliminate Long-Standing Abuses and Enrich Tax Revenue, Requesting Public Decision</p>
<p>It is found that among our country's tax systems, land tax is the most ancient, and its long-standing abuses are also the most profound. Over the past centuries, through various changes and reforms, the categories have become numerous and complicated, the tax rates are uneven, and differ from province to province and even from county to county. Currently, most of the cadastral registers no longer exist, and the grain household registers are also incomplete. The collection of land tax in each county relies solely on books secretly kept by clerks. This accumulated habit has led to numerous abuses, resulting in discrepancies between land and tax, or land without tax, and tax without land. Moreover, there are many cases of garrison lands, mountain wetlands, and urban residential lands that were not registered and taxed in the past due to special reasons. As a result, practices such as concealment, fictitious transfers, and embezzlement have arisen one after another. What the people pay cannot fully go to the public, and the government's revenue is declining daily. The debt is not with the people, and the revenue does not enter the government. Speaking of fundamental reorganization methods, the solution lies in conducting a comprehensive land survey and reforming to collect land value tax. However, considering the current national situation, popular sentiment, talent, and economy, it is not feasible to achieve results in a short time. Currently, to reorganize land tax, the only option is to treat the symptoms urgently. The best way to treat the symptoms is to conduct land reporting first, requiring landowners to report and register their household names, land locations, boundaries, area, and tax amount themselves, and provide them with certificates. Each county can then use this information to compile a more accurate and complete formal tax register. Those with discrepancies between land and tax can be corrected accordingly, those with land but no tax can be supplemented, and those with tax but no land can also be deleted. Furthermore, the original complex tax rates can also be separately reduced and merged, so that tax amounts are fair and not excessively heavy or light. With this preliminary work in place, there will be a basis for future investigation. In the future, implementing fundamental solutions such as comprehensive land surveys or land value assessments will be easier to promote. Currently, governments in various provinces also generally know that there is a significant difference between the amount of land and the amount of tax. However, their methods of investigation are all carried out exclusively by dispatched officials. The local interests and public concerns are often not taken into consideration, so they often fail to achieve results. Or, due to improper use of personnel, turmoil arises. This is due to poor planning and not because the matter is infeasible. To correct this, the only way is to find ways to make the people have a vested interest in land reporting, then things will be easier to do, and the effect will be easier to see. The following is a draft outline of measures:</p>
<p>(A) Provincial governments should formulate detailed rules for land reporting based on local conditions. Counties should select impartial gentry and legal representatives to organize land survey agencies to persuade people to engage in land reporting, so that the government can compile tax registers and revise tax laws.</p>
<p>(B) The central government should clearly stipulate that the increased tax revenue from this reporting will be retained to fund local expenses and used to offset surcharges as an incentive.</p>
<p>(C) All those who have land but no tax or more land than tax and report within the time limit will be allowed to supplement their tax. Those who conceal and fail to report will be investigated and severely punished or their concealed land will be confiscated. All fines and confiscated land will be divided to be used for public welfare needs in the county and district, and to reward informants.</p>
<p>(D) Those who report on time or delay their reporting within the extended time limit will be allowed to have their tax amount reduced or increased appropriately to show rewards and punishments. Land that is not reported will be deemed to have lost its property rights. Transfers, mortgages, and inheritance will be valid only with the land reporting certificate.</p>
<p>(E) Government officials who handle the reporting and check the reported land, and are deemed to have achieved excellent results, will be rewarded accordingly.</p>
<p>(F) The county should select the original bookkeepers and appoint them as paid officials, and provide them with real protection, ordering them to fully disclose the original tax registers for verification.</p>
<p>(G) Provincial governments should, in imitation of the registration methods of architects and accountants, formulate special regulations to examine and select personnel with surveying knowledge or experience, issue them licenses, and allow them to carry out surveying businesses in various counties, so that people can entrust them to survey their land at any time.</p>
<p>The above-proposed measures are only the major points of the easy-to-implement reorganization of land tax. The only goal is for the measures to be effective, and I dare not discuss profound theories. As for all the laws and regulations and implementation procedures, the central government and the provinces should carefully consider local conditions and handle them separately. Whether they are appropriate, I hereby request a public decision.</p>
<p>Proposal (2)</p>
<p>Proposal to Reduce Land Tax Surcharges to Revitalize the Rural Economy and Relieve the People's Hardship, Requesting Public Decision</p>
<p>It is found that in various provinces, land tax, with the exception of a few that have no surcharges, mostly have surcharges exceeding the original tax. Although the numbers are different, the people's ability to bear it is the same. Since the abolition of likin, all kinds of local undertakings have been establishing various items under the land tax, collecting surcharges along with the original tax. Among them, there is no lack of necessary expenses, but excessive spending and over-collection are also common, and the arbitrary apportionments in various rural districts are even worse. The merchants who were formerly afflicted by likin are now afflicted by agricultural surcharges. Currently, agricultural surcharges exceed the original tax by more than twenty times in some cases. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and the people are extremely distressed, if no urgent efforts are made to save the situation, the situation will develop further, the people's hardship will deepen, and communist bandits will be able to take advantage of this to incite the public. The hidden worries for the future are unbearable to imagine. Therefore, agricultural surcharges should be greatly reduced based on the ability of the people to bear them. However, in order to effectively reduce agricultural surcharges, the county's local finances must first be incorporated into the overall scope, so that agricultural surcharges and their uses are listed by district and township and reported to the county, and the county government verifies and reports to the province. Then, the true picture of the county's local revenue and expenditure can be clarified, and there will be a way to determine which surcharges should be immediately abolished, which should be temporarily postponed, which should be reduced, and which should be suspended within a time limit. After the reduction, if it is necessary to offset the reduction, there will also be an accurate amount to verify. Therefore, determining the county's local budget is the only way to limit surcharges. The following is a draft outline of measures:</p>
<p>(A) Determine the county's local financial budget, and all regular and temporary revenues and expenditures of the entire county, whether collected and disbursed by county government agencies or district and township offices, should be included in the estimates. After being reviewed by the county, it should be reported to the provincial government for strict review.</p>
<p>(B) The provincial government's review of the county's local budget should be limited to the total amount of agricultural surcharges not exceeding the original tax. If the approved county business expenses included in the budget are insufficient due to the reduction of surcharges, in addition to using the increased land tax from land reporting to make up for it, it can apply to the provincial government for approval to allocate funds for subsidies. If the provincial budget is insufficient, it can also apply to the central government for verification and special approval for assistance.</p>
<p>(C) All county local financial revenues and expenditures, whether county funds or district funds, should be uniformly reviewed and publicly announced by the county financial authorities, and all legal entities should be allowed to check the accounts at any time.</p>
<p>(D) After the county budget is finalized and announced, any revenues and expenditures outside the budget that have not been approved by the provincial government in advance should be severely punished in accordance with the punishment regulations established by the province.</p>
<p>The above-proposed measures are to enable the county to have a definite budget, to prevent arbitrary levies and excessive spending, so that surcharges can be effectively reduced, relieving the people's pain, and thus revitalizing the countryside and curbing the rise of chaos. Whether they are appropriate, I hereby request a public decision.</p>
<p>From the original text of the above two proposals, the reader should know the entire plan of the Ministry of Finance for reorganizing land tax. The former proposal regards conducting land reporting as a prerequisite for reorganizing land tax, while the latter proposal regards reducing the burden and revitalizing the countryside as the most urgent and greatest task at present. Based on my personal observations, I would like to comment on the contents of these two proposals separately for the reference of the attendees of the National Financial Conference:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Land Reporting Proposal:</p>
<p>(1) Should land reporting be uniformly conducted first to reorganize land tax?</p>
<p>It is true that our country's land tax urgently needs reorganization, and this is known to everyone. However, how to reorganize it is a matter of debate and there is no consensus. Generally speaking, the most fundamental solution is a comprehensive land survey, while the best way to treat the symptoms is to check and compile registers of grain tax. Land reporting is only one of the methods to check and compile the registers of grain tax. However, considering the local conditions, the provinces are different from each other, and the counties are different from each other. Therefore, the methods of checking and compiling maps and registers cannot be forced to fit everyone, and one cannot be forced to be the same. There are counties that should conduct land reporting; there are counties that should conduct land surveys; and there are counties that only need to conduct household name corrections because the bottom registers of tax collection have long been recovered. Since the conditions of each county are different, the method should be the responsibility of the provincial governments to consider the conditions of each county and separately determine the reorganization method. Facts should not be obliterated, and land reporting should not be uniformly conducted first. According to the conditions of various counties in Jiangsu, the counties of Jiangning, Jiangyin, Yixing, and Liyang have the deepest long-standing abuses in land tax and should conduct land reporting. However, for counties in Jiangnan with lighter abuses in land tax, and for various counties in Jiangbei, because their conditions are different, whether land reporting should be conducted uniformly is a matter to be carefully considered. For example, in various counties in Jiangbei, several counties have requested that land tax be investigated at the same time as the household registration survey, which is very economical in terms of manpower and financial resources, and is indeed easy to implement and a win-win situation. Also, in Jiangnan, such as Wu County, the bottom registers of tax collection have been recovered, and the history of the transfer and assignment of property rights of all owners is recorded in great detail. If the names and addresses of the owners can be corrected, then this register will be more complete than the land reporting register, because it is difficult to investigate and report in detail and completely the history of previous property rights transfers in the land reporting register. Some may say that the registers of tax collection are only registers of the original tax amount, and there is still no way to find out about concealed, tax-free land. This is indeed a point worth considering. I believe that investigating and squeezing out concealed grain tax cannot be achieved by reporting, and cannot be accomplished without a comprehensive land survey. Land reporting, for investigating and squeezing out concealed grain tax, is possible but not certain. Since people are allowed to report themselves, there are those who over-report and those who under-report. Considering human nature, the former are few and the latter are many. Therefore, with the amount of over-reporting and under-reporting offsetting each other, the amount that can be newly added is still likely to be very little. For the present plan, for counties with the deepest abuses in land tax, land investigation and reporting should be conducted. On the one hand, the government should supervise the various districts, townships, and towns to handle land reporting; on the other hand, the land administration agencies and finance departments of various provinces should closely cooperate to conduct land surveys. Making reporting and surveying go hand in hand can both make up for the shortcomings of reporting and avoid the complexity of future comprehensive land surveys. Then, a simple comprehensive land survey has been carried out, and a detailed cadastral register has been obtained, which is a very good and beautiful thing. Currently, the plan for land survey in Jiangsu Province has been re-established, and it is already quite similar to the non-conforming claims. As for other counties with complete registers, and counties that have already completed land surveys in the former Qing Dynasty, there is no need to conduct land investigation and reporting, only the system of bow rulers for tax collection and land tax collection needs to be rectified. (2) Criticism of the various measures proposed in the proposal</p>
<p>(1) For the general outline of measures in Part A, please consider the following points: 1. The general outline of this plan applies to counties that conduct land investigation and reporting; it does not apply to counties that do not need to conduct land investigation and reporting.</p>
<p>2. The key to land investigation and reporting is to actually implement it. The provincial governments should carefully select county magistrates in various counties to be responsible for its real implementation. It does not seem necessary to uniformly organize land survey agencies.</p>
<p>3. The method of land tax investigation should not be carried out exclusively by dispatched officials; however, even with strong persuasion, it may be difficult to achieve real results if people report themselves. Therefore, in addition to reporting on the one hand, investigation should be carried out at the same time.</p>
<p>4. This item should be revised as follows:</p>
<p>"Provincial governments should consider the local conditions and conduct land investigation and reporting in various counties, formulate detailed rules, select impartial gentry and legal representatives to participate, and supervise the various district and township heads to guide the people to engage in land reporting, and also jointly assign surveying personnel to visit and survey households at any time in cooperation with the provincial and county land administration agencies."</p>
<p>(2) For Part B, please consider the following points:</p>
<p>1. Whether land reporting can actually increase the tax amount is still a question. It is enough to hope that the previously unreal false registers can be turned into reliable and consistent registers with the original amount. If you want to produce a huge amount of additional land, it cannot be accomplished without implementing surveying at the same time. Otherwise, the number of newly added tax amounts will be very small.</p>
<p>2. If reporting and surveying are carried out at the same time, then concealed land can be found out in full, and the newly added tax amount must be large. However, the use of the new tax must also be separately stipulated according to the conditions of each province, and cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>3. Judging from the current situation in various provinces, there are four uses for the new tax amount in the provinces: one is to reduce the compensation for agricultural surcharges, two is to subsidize county local business expenses, three is to repay outstanding provincial debts, and four is to reserve it for important construction projects throughout the province. All of these must be considered and allocated by the provinces.</p>
<p>4. This item should be revised as follows:</p>
<p>"The central government should clearly stipulate that 40% of the newly added tax amount from this investigation and reporting will be used for important construction projects in the provinces, and 60% will be retained for local business expenses and used to offset surcharges as an incentive."</p>
<p>(3) For Part D, please consider the following points:</p>
<p>1. The item of allowing to reduce or increase tax amounts appropriately for those who report on time or delay their reporting is intended to provide material incentives and punishments for reporters. However, increasing or decreasing tax amounts means increasing or decreasing the burden on the people, which is of utmost importance and should be carefully considered. There are many other methods of rewards and punishments, and there is no need to change the tax amount to avoid generating malpractices.</p>
<p>2. This item should be revised as follows:</p>
<p>"Those who report within the prescribed time limit will not be charged any fees. Those who delay their reporting will be fined 50 cents per acre for handling fees (the penalty for increasing rewards and punishments is clear. It seems to be better to stipulate this than to change the tax amount). Land that is not reported will be deemed to have lost its property rights. All transfers, mortgages, and inheritance will be valid only with the land investigation and reporting certificate."</p>
<p>(4) For Part E, please consider the following points:</p>
<p>1. The conditions for submitting registers are different in each county. Some can be submitted, some cannot be submitted, and some have maps and registers mixed up and indistinguishable, the registers are scattered, and the secret copies of the registers are also unclear. It is difficult to completely submit these old registers; even if they are all submitted, they are useless. The reporting register is fundamentally different from the old tax register, and there is no way to verify them. If you want to force a verification, it will inevitably take many personnel and many days, and the verification result will mostly be inconsistent. Then what to go to and what to save, and what register to use as a basis? It is useless to create disturbances.</p>
<p>2. This item should originally be cancelled; however, in order to passively eliminate obstacles to reporting, it is still necessary to keep it.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the Proposal to Reduce Land Tax Surcharges:</p>
<p>The various articles in the general outline of measures proposed in this proposal are generally appropriate; however, there is still something to consider, which is the standard for reducing land tax. According to item B in the proposal, there are words such as "the total amount of land tax surcharge shall not exceed the original tax", that is, the verification and reduction of the surcharge is based on the original tax as the standard. However, the level of the original tax varies from province to province, and even within a province, the counties are different from each other. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, the original silver and rice taxes are different. Generally speaking, the average tax in the counties under the jurisdiction of Suzhou is 9.1 liters per mu; 8 liters per mu in Songjiang; 6 liters per mu in Changzhou; and Jingjiang is the lightest, with only a little over 2 liters per mu; 3.5 liters per mu in Zhenjiang; 2.6 liters per mu in Jiading and Baoshan in Taicang; Chongming has no tax, and Taicang is the only one that moves, which is the same as Suzhou. However, the reduction is even greater in various counties in Jiangbei. Combining the silver tax, the Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Taicang counties are different, and the counties among them are also different from each other. The disparity in grain tax and the complexity of the tax laws are almost impossible to investigate. The disparity in the land tax laws in various counties in Jiangsu Province, the heavy and light burdens, and the reduction of tax trends in the former Qing Dynasty, originated from this. According to the original silver and rice tax, the county's heavy and light tax amounts are different: for example, Nantong has an original tax as high as one yuan per mu; others such as Shanghai 82 cents, Qingpu Songjiang 76 cents, Wu County 75 cents, Jinshan 74 cents, Fengxian Chuansha Changshu, are all as high as 71 cents or more; and Zhenjiang is as high as 62 cents per mu, Jurong is only 30 cents, Jiangning is only 26 cents; also, in counties such as Chongming Qidong Gaoyou Lianshui, the highest tax rate of the original tax per mu is less than 10 cents. And in Gaoyou County, the highest tax rate of the original tax per mu is only 16 cents, and the total original tax of the county is 70,000 yuan, and the surtax is as high as 1.37 million yuan, exceeding the tax by more than 16 times; and according to the 1% standard, the total amount of original tax and surtax has not exceeded the limit. It can be seen that the level of the original tax in each county and the disparity in the proportion of its surtax, its limits and standards, are difficult to stipulate. This is the result of observing one province.</p>
<p>Now, looking at the whole country again, the original land tax in various provinces is very different. Generally speaking, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the highest, Sichuan's advance levy is the largest, Hebei's taxes are very light, Hunan and Hubei's original tax is light and the surcharges are heavy, Shandong's levy is 4 yuan per tael of silver, and Hebei's levy is only a little over 2 yuan per tael; although Jiangsu's levy is only 2 yuan and 5 cents per tael, the levy on rice is as high as 5 yuan per shih, which is a phenomenon that is absent in various provinces in North China. Therefore, the total amount of busy transport and original tax is still heavier than in other provinces. Unfortunately, there are not many reference materials in the market, and it is impossible to list all the examples of the disparity in the heavy and light taxes in various provinces across the country. As mentioned above, it is enough to see that the conditions in various provinces cannot be forced to be the same.</p>
<p>Under the actual conditions of the different provinces and counties, the method of verifying and reducing land tax surcharges, in addition to separately determining them according to the economic and social realities of the rural areas of each province, the most important standard for reducing taxes, in my humble opinion, should not be uniformly based on "the surtax shall not exceed the original tax", but should be carefully verified according to the people's burden in each province. The areas where the original tax on silver and rice is too heavy, the surtax should be strictly limited to below the original tax, or at most can only be equal to the original tax; the counties where the original tax on silver and rice is too light may be appropriately increased compared to the original tax, in order to correct the past disparity in the original silver and rice tax and to achieve fairness in the burden.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned are only the proposals themselves that the Ministry of Finance has sought opinions from various provinces and cities, and it is only intended to express</p>
<p>my personal ideals for reorganizing land tax in one in ten thousand. However, the national land tax reorganization problem is extremely complex, and to make a detailed judgment is probably not within the scope of this topic. I will wait for another day to write a detailed discussion on it. I hope that those with lofty ideals who are determined to reform land tax will immediately study this proposal of the Ministry of Finance in detail and make detailed distinctions, so that the most urgent and deeply rooted land tax problem in the country can be obtained with the most complete reorganization method for the decision of the financial conference, and it can be implemented uniformly throughout the country.</p>

<h3 id="e292">On Banks Operating Real Estate <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Junsi</p>
<p>In the past year, the flourishing of banking businesses reached its peak. Looking at the year as a whole, the establishment of new banks and branches numbered no less than dozens, and each of these dozens of banks profited greatly, with surpluses ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. On the surface, this phenomenon is certainly a celebratory event. However, if we examine it carefully, it is not difficult to realize that this phenomenon is actually an abnormal development of banks and a reflection of an unsound economic and social organization. This is because the banking industry absolutely cannot thrive independently, divorced from the closely related and interdependent industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, its impact not only provides no benefit to the struggling people but also poses a significant harm to the entire society. Upon investigation, the reason for this is that since the global economic depression, industry and commerce have been sluggish, and all sectors have declined. Banks have felt a lack of outlets for investment, facing difficulties everywhere. The accelerated bankruptcy of rural areas and the unrest in the interior have further concentrated funds in cities, flowing into banks. Bankers, feeling the difficulty of investing funds and witnessing the influx of idle capital from various places, have had no choice but to flock to government bonds and real estate. In this situation, investing in government bonds and buying and selling real estate have become the main businesses of various banks during this abnormal development. This is because everyone knows that investing in government bonds is more secure than investing in any other enterprise, and buying and selling real estate is easier to profit from than any other enterprise. However, investing in government bonds directly takes from the country and indirectly takes from the people, and its harmful impact on the development of the national economy is self-evident. The same is true for real estate. On the surface, it stimulates the market and promotes urban prosperity, but in reality, it causes real estate prices to skyrocket, making life increasingly difficult for the general public and plunging the economic and social order into extreme instability and unease.</p>
<p>In addition to their inherent banking operations, banks engaging in the real estate business is a recent phenomenon. Nowadays, most banks in Shanghai have established real estate departments, staffed by experienced personnel who specialize in this area. Their business operations are roughly similar to those of ordinary real estate companies, and can be roughly divided into three points: (1) Real estate sales and purchases; (2) Handling mortgages; (3) Property leasing. Real estate sales and purchases can be further divided into two categories: (A) When a bank is entrusted by a shareholder to find a piece of land that meets certain conditions, the bank pays attention, carefully looking for suitable locations. If a certain plot of land is suitable and the price is low, the bank can earn a large commission upon completion of the transaction as compensation. Conversely, if a property owner has land for sale, they can also entrust the bank's real estate department to handle it. If it can be sold, the bank can collect a commission as usual. (B) Banks often observe that the market in a certain area will become increasingly prosperous, and land prices will become increasingly expensive. Therefore, banks take the opportunity to buy in at low prices and then wait for the right opportunity to sell at a good price. The amount of profit earned in a short period is far beyond what other enterprises can hope to achieve. (2) Handling mortgages - When owners of real estate encounter important matters and urgently need cash for turnover, they often mortgage their properties to others. The proceeds from the mortgage are used to solve their immediate needs. In this regard, banks use their surplus funds to engage in large-scale mortgage business, either guaranteeing interest and redemption, or allocating rent for interest, and the high interest rates often reach 8% or 9% per month. (3) Property leasing - Banks manage the collection and settlement of rent for property owners and charge a handling fee accordingly. In addition, we can observe a common trend in the banking sector in recent years, namely, banks owning their own real estate. Looking at the bustling urban areas of Shanghai, the magnificent high-rise buildings that reach into the clouds are all owned by various banks (although the land on which some bank buildings stand may not be owned by the bank but leased, they are still self-built). The banks themselves certainly have limited needs and do not need a large number of offices. Therefore, in each bank building, except for the three floors used by the bank itself, the floors above the first and second floors are all used as offices for rent. In this situation, it is inevitable that they can collect considerable rent every month, and the success of their budget is an undeniable fact. However, we have observed that this trend in the banking sector is gradually showing signs of decline.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in addition to convenient transportation and excellent location, many bank offices are empty and unattended. This phenomenon proves that there is an oversupply of offices, which are entering a state of failure. At the same time, we also know that the sluggishness of industry and commerce has made most people reluctant to engage in business, and they are hesitant to move forward. The bankers are only concerned about their own interests and arbitrarily raise rents, causing</p>
<p>tenants to bear a heavy burden. Therefore, we dare to say that banks may still be able to maintain a considerable degree of success in building their own buildings and renting out offices at present. However, if this trend continues and banks do not seek to develop their business in other ways, the future danger will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>We have seen that in the socio-economic structure, nothing is more closely related to the people than the huge expense of rent in their expenditures. The high cost of rent poses a great threat to the general public. For businesses, the high rent makes it difficult to operate, and as a result, a large number of businesses feel unable to sustain themselves and are in a precarious state. This phenomenon was most evident at the end of last year. Although, generally speaking, the origin of this phenomenon is influenced by the global economic depression, the high rent, which small people cannot afford, is also a major reason. As for private homes, on the one hand, it is due to the soaring land prices, and on the other hand, it is due to rural bankruptcy. The rural population is gradually leaving the countryside and seeking a livelihood in the cities, so the rents have also increased to the extreme. In this situation, special terms such as "second landlords" and "third landlords" have emerged. Often, seven or eight families live in one house, with a large population, neglecting sanitation, and the problem of housing cannot be solved to the extreme. Therefore, some people feel their own pain and stand up to cry out loudly, demanding to get rid of it. Therefore, the enthusiastic promotion of rent reduction movements and the resulting response are not accidental but inevitable facts.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also see that real estate is not a legitimate business for banks. Here, we should ask a question: Is it because of the lack of outlets for funds that banks should not think about breaking the deadlock and specialize in some illegitimate government bonds and real estate? Although banks' buying and selling of real estate on behalf of customers is a service to society, it should be noted that the people being served are only a small number of wealthy people in society. From another perspective, banks are public service institutions and should not ignore the welfare of the masses in order to gain a little current benefit. As for the buying and selling of real estate, it all depends on</p>
<p>speculation and trickery, which is not a business policy that bankers should adopt. Secondly, as for mortgages, everyone knows that real estate is immovable property. The degree of danger for banks to accept immovable property as collateral for loans is extremely deep. Again, as for property leasing, we don't want to say anything, but we have seen banks going down a path that banks should not be going down. We feel that banks should change their policies in the future and shift the power of the real estate department to seek the welfare of the general public in order to solve the housing problems of the people in society.</p>
<p>Whether in theory or in practice, this is not an impossible thing. Banks use surplus funds to consider the situation in commercial urban areas, buy or lease suitable land, and build a large number of urban houses for rent. The construction of these urban houses does not require magnificence, but only practicality, and the most important thing is that banks should reduce their rents to the lowest possible level within the scope of possibility to reduce the burden of merchants in these exorbitant taxes. This move directly opens up a path for merchants and indirectly promotes commercial prosperity and market revitalization. Even for</p>
<p>the banks themselves, it can make their position more solid and their reputation even more outstanding. Secondly, they should build new village-style residences in the suburbs that are slightly away from the city but have convenient transportation. These residences are either suitable for middle-class families or for lower-class people to live in, in order to solve the housing problems of the general public. Investigating this action, it is certainly a great contribution to society, and for the banks themselves, it is not unprofitable to collect considerable rent every month. However, it is undeniable that the profits obtained are not as abundant as buying and selling real estate, but we know that a bank has a considerable responsibility to society and cannot ignore its more important and great mission for the sake of greed for current small profits. Therefore, I think banks should show us some achievements in serving society, reducing the burden on the people, and solving the housing problems of the people. This is a very important task, and I hope that the banking community will not neglect it!</p>

However, the short sellers of Bond No. 5 seemed to be turning their heads, and the major bulls showed no signs of activity on the surface. It was vaguely heard that a portion had already swapped outside the market, so although the delivery was gradually approaching, there was no trend of infighting. Although there were rumors, the market hardly felt any concern before there was any proof, because people's hearts were more stable than in the past, and experience was richer. Unsubstantiated rumors were not enough to shake their basic concepts. Based on this speculation, in the current chaotic environment, such as the Sino-Japanese negotiations that are neither close nor far, the Southwest National Defense Conference that is neither here nor there, Huang Fu's several hesitations in going north, the Japanese's uncertainty about North China and South China, and their confusion, so that they cannot agree on anything, and the determination of the League of Nations to cooperate with us technically, none of them cannot affect the rise and fall of the public bond market. However, because of the stability of people's hearts, unsubstantiated rumors did not cause waves. From this, it can be inferred that the recent ups and downs of the public bond market depend entirely on the unbalanced relationship between the supply and demand of chips, with slight increases and decreases. Significant changes will still depend on changes in the environment. Last week, the market was stagnant and sluggish on Monday, no less than the previous week. Market prices rose and fell by one or two jiao. On Tuesday, the Bei Bang sold out slightly more, with a slight decrease of three or four jiao. On Wednesday, due to the swap relationship, it went back up three or four jiao. Thursday was still hovering, and transactions were only swaps, and market prices rose and fell very little. On Friday afternoon, there seemed to be a squeeze on short sellers, and it suddenly improved by two, three, to eight or nine jiao, which was one of the best days of last week. On Saturday, it returned to the path of hovering, rising and falling alternately, with a fluctuation of only five fen or one jiao. In addition to swaps, there were very few new transactions, so the trading was also quite quiet. As a result of the one-week market price, it rose slightly from two, three jiao to seven, eight jiao. The total number of transactions was 48,141,000 yuan. The results of its high, low, rise and fall are shown in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was dull and unremarkable, with industry observers taking a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 pound notes, and futures prices rose by 2 pound notes to 4 pound notes. The Mumbai cotton market and the Liverpool cotton market were both closed.

<p>A New York dispatch on the 18th reported on the cotton market during the week, saying that at the beginning of the week, the market was calm, with supply slightly higher and prices falling. At the same time, bulls closed due to the loosening of securities and the fall of wheat. However, the supply in the South has been thin, so when prices fell, transactions were extremely rare. Currently, there is an opinion that regarding the expansion policy, the market is waiting to see what methods and when President Roosevelt will use to exercise the powers granted to him by his parliament. The general trend of the market is to wait for developments. The weather is generally good, but there is continued rain in the east. The cotton field is expected to be between 27 million and 30 million acres. The cotton cloth market is extremely quiet, and factories have not taken any real action to reduce working hours. Spot prices</p>
<p>are also quiet, but the basis price is firm.</p>

<p>Short and temporary, with no major adverse effects</p>
<p>(Liangzhu) The Liangzhu area of Hangzhou is also an improved sericulture area. This year, many farmers hatch improved breeds, while silkworm farmers in places such as Liuxia also raise native breeds due to economic reasons. However, due to the bad weather, the seeds of native breeds are unsound and have weak resistance, resulting in a loss of 60-70%. The silkworm ants in the improved areas have undergone scientific new methods of full relief by instructors, and there have been no major changes in the silkworm ants. When the weather turned sunny and warm during the first dormancy, the temperature was suitable, and the silkworm ants developed smoothly. The early batch of silkworms has been on the cocooning frames for four or five days, and in another two hundred days, they can be taken off the frames. However, the heavy thunderstorm last night for half an hour caused the silkworms on the cocooning frames to stop spinning silk. Fortunately, the thunder was not loud, and they resumed cocooning as usual after a while.</p>
<p>(Yuanhua) The improved breeds hatched by farmers in Jinshidun and other places hatched later due to the cold weather. During the second and third dormancy, the temperature was insufficient, and the continuous rain for ten days caused the humidity to be too high, and the silkworms changed. The instructors worked hard to coordinate and provide universal assistance, and finally used human power to control the bad weather. When the third dormancy was sufficient, the weather turned sunny and warm. During the first dormancy, the silkworm ants developed healthily. The early silkworms have all gone up the mountain to cocoon, and in three or four days, they can be taken off the frames. Last night, there was heavy rain, coupled with huge thunder. The silkworms on the cocooning frames must not hear thunder. Fortunately, it was very temporary and the thunder was still small, but the spinning of silk stopped and soon returned to normal.</p>
<p>(Shuanglin) This year is also an improved sericulture area, and farmers are raising improved breeds. However, due to the bad weather, hatching was late. During the first two dormancies, the instructors ran around to rescue them, working extremely hard. When entering the third dormancy, the weather was clear and sunny, and the silkworm ants developed smoothly. The early batch has been in the third dormancy and has sufficient mulberry leaves, and some have started to wake up from the first dormancy. The late batch has also been in the third dormancy and has been feeding on mulberry leaves for many days. Last night, there was a heavy thunderstorm, but the fresh mulberry leaves stored in advance by the instructors were enough for one day and night of feed, and there was no impact. However, the early batch of native silkworms raised by farmers suffered heavy damage during the second dormancy, and there were few remaining silkworms.</p>

<p>Lily flowers, recently due to the lack of remaining stock, the market suddenly rose. It is found that the goods on the ground and the goods handled by Shenxing are limited. It is reported from Zhenjiang that it has reached 20 yuan. The market here is also opening at 20 yuan for village dishes in the countryside. The market is calling for 22 yuan for Zhuang dishes, but it has not yet become a market. The rest of the middle and sub-grades have also followed the high trend, and the trend is tight and beautiful.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of various gangs are relatively large. It is estimated that more than 20 brands of late rice and more than 30 brands of thick japonica and various colors have arrived (a total of more than 7,000 dan). The sales have been sluggish for several days, and the stock in the port is thicker, about 100 brands (approximately tens of thousands of dan).</p>
<p>The market situation is characterized by slow sales, and it seems difficult to rise for a while. The initial market opening lacks beauty. Furthermore, the wholesale appetite is dull, and people's hearts are even more unstable. However, sellers are still trying to pull it back, and the market form is particularly stubborn. Transactions are sparse. Until noon, the Beiyang gang包胃 came out, only handling 1,500-1,600 packages of late rice from Sisi, Songjiang, and Liantang, and the buying was extremely strict. Then the sellers knew that the market color was difficult to change, so they changed their original intentions and quickly sold them off. The shop on the street then thought about moving, and the situation was able to move slightly. However, as a result, the prices of various colors have fallen back, with varying degrees of variation. For example, late rice is small near the foot, thick japonica fell by two or three jiao, and the North Ocean tip fell by one jiao, and the price changed by 3 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e301">Going to the Northwest <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Because of the bankruptcy of rural areas in all provinces of China, and frequent foreign invasions requiring urgent self-salvation, the authorities have turned their attention to the Northwest. Consequently, people from both official and public circles are unanimously and enthusiastically clamoring to go to the Northwest, to go to the Northwest. However, simply shouting to go to the Northwest will not make it happen; developing the Northwest requires grand plans and massive funding. It also requires the determination and hard work of many people, starting with the rural areas and implementing measures based on the situation. Otherwise, the result will still be more people shouting than going, and even less actually doing anything, which of course will be nonexistent. The Northwest is located on the border, with a vast area and sparse population. However, due to its fertile soil, agricultural production is extremely rich. Unfortunately, years of natural disasters have turned the Northwest farmers into a group of lamenting victims! Furthermore, in recent years, frequent internal turmoil and foreign invasions, coupled with the authorities being unable to effectively manage or adequately care for the region, have indeed been major contributing factors. Not long ago, key figures of the National Government, such as Shao Lizi, Song Ziwen, and Dai Chuanxian, personally went to the Northwest to conduct thorough inspections. Several concrete measures have now been proposed for the construction of the Northwest: (1) Irrigation, as the Northwest has suffered from drought for a long time, irrigation is the most urgent task for developing the Northwest. (2) Animal husbandry is a supplementary industry to agriculture and forestry, and is beneficial to agriculture; therefore, it cannot be neglected. (3) Prevention and control of animal diseases; with animal husbandry, the prevention and control of animal diseases is extremely important. (4) Rural cooperation, improving methods, strengthening forces, to enhance the foundation of agriculture.</p>
<p>We have no doubts about the above measures for developing the Northwest; however, the points I want to make now are not such simple matters; rather, they are some opinions that I wish to respectfully offer to the authorities developing the Northwest. Undoubtedly, these are tasks we should do before going to the Northwest, preparations we should make before discussing the construction of the Northwest.</p>
<p>How can we develop the Northwest? This is a huge question; however, the question itself is always worth studying. According to my suggestion, to develop the Northwest, we only need to utilize prisoners and the poor, sending them to the Northwest to engage in the hard labor of reclaiming wasteland; on one hand, the government should allocate huge funds to undertake various construction projects, and at the same time, it is hoped that the financial community and capitalists will invest as much as possible in agricultural and forestry industries or construction projects, so as to promote their development and prosperity. As for commerce, education, sanitation, public security, transportation, water conservancy, agricultural reclamation, and other construction projects, they should all be established and promoted separately. All prisoners selected to go to the Northwest should have their sentences appropriately reduced by a certain percentage, and after their sentences are completed, they should be given appropriate jobs separately. Each poor person should be given a few acres of mountain land and a few acres of farmland; during the construction period, they can freely cultivate the land, without paying land rent or land prices, and without being subject to any taxes. It is also advisable to consider the situation and establish industrial factories, recruiting unemployed workers to go there to work: in order to advance both relief and construction.</p>
<p>When it comes to developing the Northwest, it should be divided into several steps, decided upon, and then carried out step by step; the first step is preparation, the second step is trial implementation, and the third step is implementation. After these three steps are completed, we can take a further step in construction and improvement. I think that with this method, although I dare not say that it will achieve twice the result with half the effort, at least it will have considerable success.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Lost Check <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Peng</p>
<p>Since the New Life Movement was launched, whether it's carrying lanterns or attending meetings, if you have this "hard expansion" badge, you can pass without hindrance. I heard that although grass skirt striptease was banned, those swaggering Russian women are still performing on stage, with advertisers cleverly calling it fitness, which is naturally also part of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Now that "Peach Blossom River" and "Dance Partner's Song" are banned, why not say that this is the New Life Movement, promoting healthy and beautiful voices, so that these charming and delicate famous songs can be heard in the world a few more times!</p>
<p>The so-called tricks are known to everyone, but each has its own skill. In the past, when the Northern Expedition was completed, opening your eyes revealed a "Sun Yat-sen World." Barber shops were called "Sun Yat-sen," Western restaurants were also "Sun Yat-sen," "Sun Yat-sen" rubber shoes, and "Sun Yat-sen" Hong Kong beef. Compared with today's New Life Movement, it can be seen that mankind has exhausted its intelligence.</p>
<p>Last year there was a time called the "Prize-Winning Cigarette" era, where ten empty packs could be exchanged for a prize coupon, with top prizes of several thousand or ten thousand yuan, etc. Later, the government, fearing that it would steal the business of aviation lottery tickets, ordered a ban. But this kind of good business has to find a way to continue; so now someone has invented the "lost check," and there's no way to stop it. In a few days, the cigarettes handed over from others all had that bird-like, non-bird-like trademark. After all, everyone loves money, a huge sum of a thousand yuan. Since you're smoking anyway, why not smoke XX brand! And the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance only issued an order saying that this move might cause other cigarette factories to follow suit and hold cash prize giveaways, which would violate the department's regulations, so they would no longer be allowed to publish the winners' names in the newspapers, etc. However, the company claims that these "lost checks" are invented for the sake of the company's reputation and will be redeemed with half the amount in cash, so they will definitely continue to do so. Looking at it this way, that bird-like, non-bird-like trademark will definitely spread like wildfire! Although the New Life Movement prohibits smoking, the cigarette company has a new invention that is unprecedented and unparalleled, which is also the newest life in the sound of the New Life Movement. The old cigarette companies that used to appeal with prize coupons, hurry up and move forward! As long as you're not stupid, you're bound to have a more wonderful trick than the "lost check" to promote your goods. I'm paying attention to this big advertisement every day!</p>
<h3 id="e303">Thoughts on the Far Eastern Games <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Rong</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Far Eastern Games, our country has had little hope in anything other than soccer, especially in track and field, which has been almost completely wiped out. It's truly regrettable. However, news came that our country's women's swimming, through the efforts of Yang Xiuqiong and others, had won several championships in a row. Not only were those who care about sports excited to hear this, but every one of us Chinese people had to jump for joy three hundred times. Newspapers also said: Filipinos criticized our country's female athletes for coming not to compete in sports, but to compete in beauty. This completely overturned these ridiculous criticisms. This aroused some small thoughts in me: The purpose of sports is to cultivate a strong physique. In addition to this, it can also cultivate morality, train intelligence, and create a healthy and beautiful physique. This is a well-known fact. In the new era of the twentieth century, the old standards for measuring beauty and ugliness are no longer applicable. The frail physique of the oriental type like Lin Daiyu has become something that has been eliminated and discarded. In this era, what is held up as our standard of beauty is a healthy, strong, and active spirit. But this can only be obtained through diligent exercise and attention to health, and it can never be achieved through artificial affectation. Applying Parisian perfume, applying scarlet nail polish, adding beauty marks, and perming hair are just taking the decorative techniques of the feudal era and re-enacting them in a new way. Although people are wearing the clothes of "modernity," their bones are no different from those of women of the Lin Daiyu type. Extravagance, weakness, and frivolity are everywhere, driving backward and doing "corrupting" work everywhere. This phenomenon is already a common sight in cities.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that the education authorities can, on the one hand, curb the extravagant and frivolous academic atmosphere, and on the other hand, promote healthy and beautiful sports. In the sports field, we should pay special attention to the cultivation of true strong physiques and the formation of true competitive spirit, and spread the true meaning of sports to the minds of students. As for the athletes who represent the entire nation in international sports games, they should be especially cautious, because their every move is related to the reputation of the entire country. Not to mention the past, even in this Far Eastern Games, the Filipinos' slander of our female athletes is of course too arrogant, but we should ask ourselves, do our country's "female athletes" really have places that cause misunderstandings? Why do they mock us alone and not the female athletes of other countries? Because of this, I remembered the story of a female ball team member who was ridiculed by foreigners for applying powder on her legs when playing ball, and I felt even more that people in society should loudly call for curbing this bad trend. The extravagance and frivolity of one team member will affect all the athletes, and behind all the athletes stands the entire nation. Athletes representing China should not only sew the national flag on their clothes, but also sew it on their entire hearts. Only in this way will they be serious and not think that this is a trip abroad to show off and compete in beauty, and as a result only bring back ridicule and no trophies!</p>
<p>This time, Yang Xiuqiong and others were able to compete with strength and bring glory to the country, which is worthy of admiration, but I did not erase the other female athletes with success or failure. Taking volleyball as an example, the female athletes' crying after the defeat, although their competitive spirit was thwarted, can also be seen in their patriotic enthusiasm. I hope that after the athletes return to China, they can encourage each other, avoid the temptation of vanity, and painstakingly forge a stronger physique. Healthy beauty is genuine beauty without discount, and the glory of sufficient physical strength is genuine glory. If you truly understand this, then scarlet rouge, perfume, and lipstick will all become meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="e304">On Nurseries and Public Childcare <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities in this city established a relatively large-scale nursery. This, in terms of "social construction," is undoubtedly very valuable. In the past, similar places in our country, such as the inherent infant homes, baby protection centers, and universal nurseries, were mostly set up to accommodate abandoned, ownerless infants and children. They were merely charitable undertakings operated under a narrow sense of humanitarianism. Pure childcare institutions with socio-educational ideals like this seem to be groundbreaking in our country. The theoretical basis for setting up nurseries is generally based on the European and American theory of "public childcare." This has close relationships with issues such as social evolution, women's economy, and infant education and upbringing. Therefore, if the establishment of nurseries in this city this time is not merely a formalistic, superficial decoration, we may as well assume that it is the first step in the widespread implementation of public childcare. In that case, this issue seems to be worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Public childcare is quite active in Europe and America, and can be effectively implemented in Soviet Russia, achieving effective results. Their facilities for public childcare are particularly meticulous, stipulating that a public childcare area must be specially set up for every certain number of people, including enrollment offices, fetal centers, lactation centers, infant hospitals, infant playgrounds, kindergartens, children's sports fields, children's health rooms, children's small craft workshops, children's libraries, children's reformatories, etc. Experts are also selected and hired to organize children's research institutes, studying children's physiology, children's psychology, children's education, and children's training at any time, implementing them in practice, in order to achieve the most perfect and beautiful state. Such large-scale public childcare institutions will directly give us great yearning. Regarding the theoretical system advocating public childcare, in Europe and America, it can be roughly divided into two schools: one is the socialist school, represented by people such as George Bernard Shaw. They particularly focus on the efficiency of social evolution, believing that women are "social beings" and not members attached to the family. Therefore, they advocate reforming the family system, liberating women's status, in order to provide for social tasks, and the responsibility of raising children should naturally be borne by society. The second is the feminist school, represented by people such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman. They focus on women's own rights and interests, advocating women's economic independence and occupational liberation, using public childcare to regulate their family burdens. The arguments of these two schools each have a theoretical basis, and although their positions are different, their conclusions on the implementation of public childcare are similar.</p>
<p>The position of this city's nursery establishment this time is probably no exception to the above two schools. As a superficial and inexperienced person, the author certainly cannot make any criticisms in terms of theory. However, based on our observation of the current social situation in our country, national economy, cultural level, and various aspects of family concepts, whether it is urgent to promote public childcare, I feel that there are still points of doubt that are worth discussing in detail.</p>
<p>Due to the economic collapse and the low cultural level, the social structure of modern China fully shows its deformed morbid state. Women are engaged in occupations, but in reality, it is only a short-term youth. The so-called task of following society is only a dream of a clear autumn. Some people say that marriage is the only profession for women, although it is a joke, it is actually the truth. Then, since the current society cannot retain considerable positions for mothers who have children, this kind of nursery dedicated to childcare has already lost its necessity of existence. Moreover, women have a natural "maternal duty" towards their children. This maternal duty is an absolute obligation in ethics, a relative obligation to society, and children are the mainstay of the future society. Women raising children to be physically and mentally healthy are also serving society. The true value of this task, compared with the profession of being a vase in an institution or a living advertisement in a mall, is like the difference between heaven and earth. Then the existence of nurseries has obviously lost its theoretical basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, children and families have an inseparable relationship. Children are the happy center of the family. Couples often use children as a tool to maintain emotions, and having children and grandchildren around the knees can create family happiness. John Dewey said, "Without children, the house becomes just a building." Therefore, promoting public childcare will inevitably destroy the integrity of the family. Only a few adults are left in the family, which becomes a cold world, and what is the fun of life? And the family is the paradise of children's lives. Parental love is the only food in children's lives, otherwise, it is difficult to survive. Now, wanting to entrust weak infants to unrelated third parties is truly a great cruel act. According to statistics from the city of Paris, France, the mortality rate of public childcare children is more than three times higher than that of ordinary children. Then, doesn't the nursery become a great crisis? Moreover, in the current state of economic turmoil and poverty in China, families below the middle class will definitely have no extra money to pay a childcare fee to the nursery every month. If there are more than two children, it is far less economical than breastfeeding on their own. Therefore, the establishment of nurseries, in fact, only opens the door wide for those frivolous playboys, and the result may become the tail of illegitimate children and adulterous children; this is too far from the original intention of running nurseries.</p>
<p>The above is the author's personal subjective view, and perhaps some people will ridicule it as being outdated. But I believe my attitude is very sincere.</p>

<h3 id="e307">National Salvation Through Simple Clothing <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>"Can the slogan 'National Salvation Through Simple Clothing' save the country?" Several years ago (in 1918 and 1932), I had already started this movement. At that time, because I was still an apprentice who had not completed his apprenticeship, my knowledge was shallow and my strength was weak, and I could not persuade people all over the country, which was a great regret. What I advocated at that time was all to my confidants, such as "relatives," "friends," and "clansmen," etc. Of course, the effect was limited. Now, at this time of national crisis, my regret has been aroused again, so I am writing this letter to ask you.</p>
<p>(1) How should it be communicated to the whole country so that everyone buys domestic cotton cloth?</p>
<p>(2) It is easy to implement this method in rural villages (because of their frugality), but it is difficult to implement in prosperous cities such as "Shanghai," "Hankou," and "Nanjing." What method can be improved and made easier to implement?</p>
<p>(3) How to stop the sales of foreign cloth? What is the reason for its sale?</p>
<p>(4) How deep is this problem for the interests of the country?</p>
<p>(5) Why can't Chinese native cloth be consumed by most people?</p>
<p>(6) How to encourage the public's enthusiasm to buy native cloth?</p>
<p>(7) Why is the production of cotton in China, which has a wide land, so scarce? What method can be used to encourage the villagers to improve and increase the harvest so that the factory does not use foreign cotton?</p>
<p>Please give your best guidance on the above issues, which will not only benefit the country, but also slightly activate the people's economy. When I am doing business at the counter now, I also publicize my views and persuade farmers not to buy foreign cloth. Foreign cloth is not as durable, strong, and economical as Chinese cloth. Although I am persuading them so painstakingly, I don't know if God can make me achieve my wish? Sincerely wish you</p>
<p>Xu Zhuyou</p>
<p>Answer: Many of the questions you asked are repetitive, so I will answer them all together. There are many slogans for saving the country, such as "Saving the country by reading" and "Saving the country by aviation," etc. "Saving the country by simple clothing" is just one of these slogans. The purpose of advocating "saving the country by simple clothing" is nothing more than two things: promoting the virtue of frugality and developing the national economy. What you pay attention to is the latter, and now we will discuss the meaning of the latter.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, we would never have had this slogan. We all wore native cloth at that time, but as a result of wearing native cloth, our country was not saved, but fell into a more miserable fate. The reason for advocating native cloth now is that more and more people are using "foreign cloth" and fewer and fewer people are using "domestic cloth." Therefore, if we want to make people buy native cloth, we must make "foreign cloth" not be bought or used by anyone in China. The reason why foreign goods are dumped in China is nothing more than two things: good quality and low price, and foreign goods have various privileges in China and are not subject to harsh taxes. Therefore, if we want to develop our country's national economy, or more specifically, revitalize our country's industry, or more practically, have the people all use their own goods to avoid the outflow of interests, we should cancel the conditions for foreign goods to be dumped in China. Foreign cloth is of good quality and low price, and our domestic cloth is of better quality and lower price. Increase the tariff rate to raise the cost of foreign goods, and at the same time abolish harsh taxes to lower the price of domestic cloth. In this way, is there any reason why domestic cloth will not sell well? Is there any reason why anyone would want to buy foreign cloth?</p>
<p>The editor is very respectful to all those who are determined to save the country, but he is often not satisfied with the means he takes. The motivation of those who advocate "saving the country by simple clothing" is very pure, but this kind of movement may not be put into practice, and its effect may not be beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If people are poor, they will wear native cloth even if they don't save the country. On the other hand, if they are encouraged by patriotism to wear native cloth, they will not be able to last in the end. Even if it can last, it will not save the country. Many farmers in the countryside wear "native cloth," but the country is not saved because they wear native cloth. On the contrary, they themselves are extremely poor and need the country to save them. By analogy, everyone wears "simple clothes," but everyone is poor, and the country becomes a "simple clothing country," but it is often subject to the oppression of imperialists. In this way, what salvation have the "country" and the "people" gained? Leaving aside the purpose, just in terms of realization, the two effective methods we mentioned earlier for making people use "domestic cloth" instead of "foreign cloth" will definitely not be put into practice under the current situation. Abolishing the privileges enjoyed by foreigners in China or asking for higher tariffs, how dare ordinary timid people like carp raise these demands to foreign countries? Of course, making things with good quality and low price themselves can resist foreign goods. However, comparing the economic structure of our country today with those of other countries in the world, this is also impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, we know that to save China, it is not possible to achieve results by patching up bit by bit. The only way we can save China is to remove all the shackles that imperialists have placed on China, that is, to "abolish all unequal treaties" as mentioned in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will.</p>
<p>As for how to achieve this, the editor believes that we can only achieve our goal by firmly holding the attitude of preferring to be shattered like jade rather than surviving like a tile, and by dealing with the imperialists. Editor</p>

<p>— By English writer George Gissing, translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>Mr. Dymond was not versed in psychology. But he immediately and very clearly saw the moral crisis he had been living through. Moreover, the question of poverty once again taught him a truth.</p>
<p>After breakfast, he immediately went downstairs and knocked on Mr. Shag's office door. "What is it?" the bookbinder asked, his mouth full as he ate his fourth piece of bacon.</p>
<p>"Sir, I would like to request a leave of absence for an hour or two this morning. There is something important that I need to do."</p>
<p>Mr. Shag replied with the elegance befitting a man of his type, "I suppose you can go ahead and do as you please. I wasn't paying you any salary anyway."</p>
<p>The speaker bowed and withdrew.</p>
<p>Two days later, he wrote another letter to Mrs. Weale. The letter read as follows:</p>
<p>"The money you so kindly sent, which I have received, has now been distributed. To ensure the proper use of these funds, I have entrusted the cheque and a clear statement of its intended use to a local pastor. He has kindly included a list of the beneficiaries' names in an attached letter, which I believe will satisfy you.</p>
<p>"But, you will ask me, why did I seek the help of the pastor? Why do I not, based on my own experience, aid the poor people in whom I have a personal interest? Why is this pleasure not given to myself -- I, the man dedicated to a mission of mercy?</p>
<p>"The answer is both simple and clear. I have lied to you.</p>
<p>"I do not live in this place of my own free will. I am not dedicated to charitable work. I am merely – no, no, I WAS – a poor gentleman who, at one time, because of a foolish speculation, lost his fortune and, ashamed to explain this to his friends, fled into an unfortunate life of seclusion. You see, I have added shame to misfortune. I do not wish to tell you how close I came to doing something bad.</p>
<p>"I have learned a skill, which I believe will supplement my meagre income and allow me to live a better life than before. If possible, I ask you to forgive me and forget me henceforth.</p>
<p>Your tedious S.T. Dymond"</p>

<h3 id="e309">Why Stars Cannot Be Mothers (Part 2) <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Dao</p>
<p>Hollywood's Declining Productivity</p>
<p>A Star's Motherhood Means Sacrificing a Career</p>
<p>The first person we must mention is, of course, Gloria Swanson, known as a 'good mother'. She has been married several times, but marriage has not hindered her career. Later, because of her intense love for children but her reluctance to give birth herself, she adopted several children, which did not affect her career. It wasn't until she still felt empty and had to have her own children that her career suffered a great blow. Becoming a mother herself meant losing her status as a star. Although she struggled desperately to return to the screen, her hardship was even greater than when she worked hard as a swimmer in the past. Recently, although she has won the sympathy of the film industry, and her former employer MGM has given her a contract, it is feared that this is merely an expression of MGM's sympathy for an aging actress. Norma Shearer is always mentioned as an actress whose motherhood was not enough to ruin her future. But let us examine this more closely. She is indeed a big star - with stunning beauty, a distinct personality, and a talent for acting. She also married a powerful film entrepreneur, Irving Thalberg - who was also doing his best to help her fight to return to the screen. However, how does her career compare to before she became a mother? The film she starred in after giving birth was A Free Soul, but that film did her no good. That film made Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, and Leslie Howard even more famous, while Norma Shearer remained the same, with no progress. Although her looks have not aged, her artistry has not diminished, she works hard herself, and she has a powerful husband to help her, it will probably be extremely difficult for her to regain her former position as a first-rate leading actress. Let's take another example, Helen Twelvetrees. Several years ago, she gave up her film career to have a child. At that time, she was in a top role, earning $2,700 a week. But she gave it up lightly. She originally thought that she could have a child, rest for a few months, and then return to the screen. She did not know that she was taking a great risk. So, after she had her child and recovered her health, she found that her status as a star had dropped to that of an ordinary actress. And she had to start all over again. Because of the difficulty of finding work, she had to take on small roles for small salaries. She said: 'I want to prove that my abilities have not diminished at all, so I have to work hard.' It is true that her abilities have not been lost at all, but the film industry changes in an instant. In the few months that she was giving birth, the world was no longer the world it used to be.</p>
<p>There are countless examples like this. Bebe Daniels is also one of them. There is no need to mention other less famous actresses. Some people say that if an actress has children before becoming famous, her children will not necessarily affect her status. For example, Marlene Dietrich, before she became famous, already had Maria. But she never dared to let her daughter meet the audience in 'The Scarlet Empress'. Later, although she allowed her daughter to show her face in that film, she was still somewhat uneasy about the result. She is indeed a very careful person. (End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e310">Review of "The House on 56th Street" - Da Guangming Theater <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Based on past observations and experience, we believe this is a very marketable work. After watching it, the playwright grabs the audience's sympathy with a sentimental sophistry, and the Chinese audience is relatively easy to accept the atmosphere of tragedy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the clear and understandable narrative method from beginning to end makes it relatively easy for people to understand.</p>
<p>I think that most people will not deny that this is a thoroughly sentimental work. Of course, some explanation must be added to the nature of sentimentality. The sentimentality of 'Storm in a Teacup' damaged and even destroyed the enthusiasm for progress. Therefore, the sentimental method should be abandoned by progressive writers; for the sake of a powerful emphasis on the effect of the play. Then how should we explain the use of this sentimental method of writing about the decadent lives of the upper classes? Perhaps some people will say; let us let them sigh at the sentimentality in their decline process, it has nothing to do with us. However, this reason is not entirely correct. When a clever author uses the emphasized sentimentality to make us sympathize with people we should not sympathize with, then this is the author's victory, but for the vulnerable audiences, it is a loss, although there is no poison of any degree in the work. I remember that Warner Bros.' son-in-law (i.e., Lorell, the director of 'The Story of Louis Pasteur') once said in an interview in Japan that the main feature of Warner Bros.' film production is the novelty of the story, and they even often ask many people to find script materials from newspapers and magazines. We can very well believe this statement from Lorell's mouth. Then the so-called twists and turns of the story of 'The House on 56th Street' are indeed not accidental. Indeed, on the surface, the story here is very bizarre and tortuous. Regarding this point, I think there is no need to copy the instruction manual to introduce it, anyway, people who have seen it will always admit it. However, precisely because it is intentionally made tortuous, it is organized using the method of sophistry. It is inevitable that there are not enough real places in the structure, and many overly idealized places write the dancer played by Claudette Colbert as a Superman. Naturally, we understand that the playwright is making the heroine Lily move upward. Under the interpretation of the old concept, she became a virtuous wife and mother from the life of a dancer. Although she has a hereditary love of gambling, and although she is proficient in gambling, she wants to work hard to be a good person, use her skills to teach her daughter not to gamble, and even do so for the gamblers. In this way, she became a Superman. She was imprisoned for twenty years on suspicion of murder, and later was willing to suffer for her daughter, although she was acquitted because of the political power of the gangster. What is even more obvious is that after accidentally meeting the gambler on the ship, she immediately repented and returned the money she had won to him, which is definitely not something that ordinary people can do. However, the playwright is always a sophist. In his creative methods, such small places will not be noticed. For example, he never lets the daughter know her mother, which increases the great tragic power. Naturally, the theme of this work is against gambling. And on the other hand, it also exposed the shortcomings of unclear laws. However, from the perspective of the protagonist's personality development, this is that the woman's fall does not have its inevitability. However, he sophistically raped the audience's emotions, and this person who should not be sympathized with finally made people sympathize. Speaking of sophistry and rape, of course we will not ignore Robert Florey, the French director who is now in China inspecting the exteriors of 'Oil Lamps'. He emphasized the sentimentality of the play using extremely skilled film techniques. The editing is economical, the narration is clear and smooth, no abuse of music, no trendy manufacture of gimmicks or exaggerations, and in the slightest, static sounds are used to increase the psychological changes of the people in the play, and the actors are fully allowed to develop their dramas. Sentimentality is everything in the play, and sentimentality is also the director's greatest victory. The protagonist Claudette Colbert played a role with the same sentiment as in 'Imitation of Life', but it was the highest achievement she has achieved in all the works she has starred in.</p>
<h3 id="e311">"The Show-Off" - Cathay Theater <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>This is an adaptation of George Kelly's comedy, which is light, funny, and contains some slight satire on life.</p>
<p>Most of the story is made up of coincidences, and the ending can be said to be unreasonable, but in the playwright's unintentional, it reflects a lot of satire on modern marriage problems, and slightly reveals some of the sorrows of the petty bourgeoisie. Of course, this is just an unintentional revelation and reflection.</p>
<p>A salary earner who is good at showing off his wealth but is actually poor marries the daughter of a real estate company owner by chance, but after marriage, his 'nature' is exposed, and he is 'greatly ridiculed by his in-laws', and 'the woman is extremely angry, and urges him to leave'. This is something that can be heard and seen every day. Later, after wandering and drifting around, he falls to the streets as a 'sandwich board man', which is what salary earners (especially those who like to show off) should encounter at this stage. However, American films certainly do not allow such a tragic ending, so as usual, they use one or two accidental opportunities to make him 'get lucky' and the couple reconcile. It is very clear that as long as the audience is a little sober, they can know that such 'good luck' is rare, and such couples often cannot 'reconcile'.</p>
<p>The places that reflect the reality of society are very touching, such as being ridiculed by the mother-in-law and ridiculed by the wife, etc. However, those places about 'good luck' inevitably make people feel that they are acting. Spencer Tracy's good acting is worth seeing.</p>

<p>— Hou Yuhong</p>
<p>Because the Star Company values this film too much, it spares no effort to go all out. The actresses include Xuan Jinglin, Gao Qingping, Ai Xia, etc., and the actors include Gong Jianong, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Wang Zhengxin, etc., but the facts tell us that this 'Two Against One' has not achieved more excellent results because of so many excellent actors. The reason is that the story is too scattered and the meaning is too vague. The director cannot get the center of directing the progress, and the actors cannot grasp the goal of expressing emotions. Therefore, except for dancing, singing, and drinking champagne, it can be said that there is nothing. This is what we deeply regret!</p>
<p>The individual expressions of the actors, Gong Jianong and Wang Zhengxin are better, and the actresses have no emotions to speak of. The two ball games lack tension because of too many splicing problems. But why does the Star Company want to go all out to perform such a superficial script? In addition to feeling that there is no drama to perform, I am afraid it is also to avoid the demands of the directors.</p>

<p>— Shu Ming</p>
<p>When Yvette ran into Al's office, Harry had already taken the five thousand dollars and left. Yvette didn't know and still wanted Al to find a way to stop Harry from leaving. Al told her that Harry had just taken the five thousand dollars. When Yvette heard this, she jumped up and made a big scene with him. She scolded him. She said, 'I always thought of you as a friend, but it turns out you are so heartless!' Al let her make a scene because he knew very well that what he did was entirely for Yvette and he had done nothing wrong. Moreover, he himself deeply loved her. Now that Harry had left, he could slowly find a way to make her forget about Harry. While Yvette was making a fuss, Li suddenly ran in. He told Al that Harry was going to run away with Mrs. Renard. Al didn't believe it and said, 'Are you crazy!' Li snorted and said, 'Am I crazy? They just broke up. I was watching her. She later sneaked out through the side door and went to Harry's car. She is still waiting for Harry in the car, waiting for him to finish his performance before leaving.' Yvette was stunned and couldn't speak for a moment. Al was furious and said, 'To abduct the wife of one of the most powerful men in Paris! This is how he repays me! My hotel is going to be ruined!'</p>
<p>Al immediately went outside the side door and found Harry's car. He took a flashlight and shone it into the car and sure enough, he saw Mrs. Renard curled up. He said, 'Mrs. Renard, a thousand apologies. Someone told me that you went to the wrong car. You went to someone else's car.' The beautiful Liane said, 'That's right, but thank you for being so careful. My husband and I are going home with the owner of this car.' Al said, 'Great. I'll go tell Mr. Renard that you're waiting here.'</p>
<p>Liane hurriedly stopped him and said, 'No, no, he'll come himself.' Al had a change of heart and thought that he had to change his strategy. He said, 'Mrs. Renard, when can we be frank with each other?' Mrs. Renard pretended not to understand and said, 'What frankness?' Al then said very calmly, 'You have to understand that your husband is a close friend of mine and often takes care of my hotel. If I let his wife do something wrong, he will definitely blame me, understand?' Liane said angrily, 'I don't understand!' Al then warned her very solemnly, 'If you leave here with Harry, you will regret it for the rest of your life!' Liane said angrily, 'How dare you--come and talk to me like that!' Al touched his pocket and said slowly, 'I have the guts, but not as big as Harry's. Do you know where Harry got the money to run away with you?' Liane couldn't speak for a moment. Al then took out the diamond necklace and showed it to her and said, 'He sold me your necklace.' After he finished speaking, he put the necklace in her hand and said, 'This is a small gift from me, please accept it, madam.' Liane grabbed Al's hand. She got out of the car and walked back into the ballroom with Al. Harry and Yvette had just taken the stage to perform the whip dance. Yvette stood solemnly at the door of the ballroom, listening to the music of her whip dance, preparing to take the stage. She was inserting a sharp knife into her garter. The knife was originally an accessory in the whip dance. A moment later, the two of them took the stage and the atmosphere in the entire hall was extremely tense. (To be continued)</p>
