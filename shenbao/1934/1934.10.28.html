<p>據最近的消息。諮詢處所發出的登記表只有一百五十份。而失業的大學畢業生前來登記的還不過一百二十人。我們相信實際上的失業人數。必不止於這一點。登記初步之所以不甚踴躍。固然和諮詢處成立期間的短促有關。而最大的理由。恐怕還是因爲一般失業者感覺諮詢處的介紹缺乏獲得職業的把握。然而那一百二十個實行登記的人。却並不因此而遲疑其行動。可知其希望獲得職業和信仰諮詢處的心理實在是異常的濃厚。現在離開今年暑期開始的時候。已不下四個月了。據我們的猜測。這一百二十人中。除了少數的例外。至少已飽嘗了四足月失業的痛苦了。靑年人在相當的限度内受些磨難和打擊。未始没有好處。過了限度以外。就難免不失望消極甚而至於横决。諮詢處在進行介紹工作的初期。固然應該特别愼重。但亦不可不認清牠本身是一個非常期中的政府機關和普通民營性質的介紹所逈然不同。就是其介紹的範圍雖不限於政府一隅。亦以政府機關的成分居多。普通的介紹所荐人就業。當然須注重對外的信用。然後才可維持其本身的營業。而諮詢處以一政府機關的資格。爲其他的政府機關荐人。就可無須顧慮到這一層。平心而論。在現狀之下。依這樣介紹方法而謀得的信置。總不會十分的優越。所以其所需要的人才標準亦不應該十分的嚴格。如果諮詢處的目標偏重爲謀人者求眞才。而不偏重爲謀業者求生活。結果所能帮助的只不過是極少數優秀的失業份子。不免忽略了大多數的人。我們以爲諮詢處最初幾次的介紹。對於被介紹人的品性道德。固須特别注重。對於他們的知識和技能的標準。不妨抑低一些。而其介紹的範圍則應儘先向政府機關去求安揷。那末對外的信用問題。亦就可以不致發生了。最初幾次有了相當的成就。然後才能引起其他失業者的重視。至於往後用什麽方法去隨時安揷每年專科以上的畢業生。當然不是諮詢處的權力所能過問的。這事的整個解决。是全中國政治的和社會的組織問題。談何容易。如果只就治標方面而論那就大半要看這次考銓會議的結果如何了。</p>
<p>我們知道考試院銓叙部對於專科以上畢業生的出路問題早已鄭重的考慮。最近就想在考銓會議中提。議公務員應每年舉行一年考。三年舉行一總考。成續惡劣的。實行淘汰。高等考試每年秋季舉行一次。被淘汰的公務員。卽由每屆高考及格人員按期遞補本來一個現代國家的。政府。對於專門人才。應當盡量任用。而不當僅以介紹爲限。萬一中央和地方政府的地盤。大半爲一部分人所覇佔。而覇佔地盤的人。又多靠其特殊的背景或相互間的勾結而維持其濤命。那末因了銓選不公登庸冗濫的結果。自然不能不引起有知識的失業靑年的憤懑。這次銓叙部的擬議。如能眞正提出以至於實行。那確是在當今環境下最切實而澈底的辦法了。希望銓叙部當局在考銓會</p>
<p>議中能够貫澈他們的成議。</p>

<h3>美當局宣布日欲霸遠東市塲</h3>
<p>油問題續向日交涉</p>
<p>日本掩飾識者齒冷</p>
<p>（華盛頰）政府官員今日表示、「滿洲國」之煤油專賣卽日本獨霸遠東後排擠外國商業之一種方式、而滿政府之煤油專賣計劃、適與日本在倫敦海軍談話提出之要求同時發表、故其意義非黨重大、東京方面雖稱、對於此事並無關係、但外界則認此爲飾詞、蓋以日本固曾明白担負「滿洲國」外交之責也、再者、日本半官性質之南滿鐵路將握該專賣公司之大多數股權、至於日本外務省發言人所稱、抗議應向「滿洲國」提出云云、華盛頓官塲對之至爲冷淡、而認其爲故弄狡猾、美國駐日大使格魯聞將奉令向日本繼續交涉此事、非至獲得滿意結果不止、「滿洲國」雖非門户開放政策之條約國、惟其官員曾担保永久維持門户開放主義、况日本係屢次聲明盡力維持開放門户政策、美國政府堅决主張煤油專賣實違反日本與外國簽訂之種種條約、英國與荷蘭亦已進行交涉、（二十六日國民電</p>

<h3>倫敦泰晤士報所載日本建議内容</h3>
<p>將軍艦分防禦攻擊兩種</p>

<p>防禦軍艦三國任意决定</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本代表團口頭提出之海軍建議、雖未公布、但泰晤士報自稱可向讀者說明其大略、其言曰、「日本代表雖未用書面堤出建議、但吾人已知其將軍艦分爲防禦攻擊兩種、凡航空母艦·裝甲艦·巡洋艦均屬於攻擊之列、易言之、卽倫敦條約所謂「Ａ級」軍艦、且備有六时口徑以上之砲位者是也、東京政付欲以上兩種軍艦分别加以限制、例如屬於攻擊性質之航空母艦·裝甲艦·及巡洋艦、各國可保有之艘數及噸數、均應歸於一律、不稍寛假、尤其是航空母艦如能完全廢除、日本並不反對、至防禦性質之軍艦、則包括小噸位之巡洋艦·驅逐艦·與潛水艇、所謂小噸位之巡洋艦、卽其砲位口徑至多不過六时者是也、又屬於攻擊性質之三種軍艦、就總噸數加以限制、而屬於防禦性質軍艦之噸數如何分配、則英美日三國得任意决定之、此外日本代表團在理論上雖主張該國海軍應與英美絕對平等、但又表示東京政府並非在實際上卽欲建造與英美兩國相等之海軍、蓋該國海軍最同高額數、當俟必要時始乃達到也、」云云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）政府高級當局今日宣稱、據日本所建議之海軍計劃、三海軍國各應得之總噸位將較日本現在海軍力爲低、日本之計劃將使三國大减軍備、尤以英美兩國爲甚、故該計劃告成之時、三國之海軍比率將爲二·二·二及三·三·三云、該高級官員繼稱、日本預料英美兩國將拒絕此項計劃、是則日本將表示讓步而成立三·三·三比率云、外交討論會今日公布世界海軍調查報告稱、一九三一年以來、日本軍費已增加一倍、日本軍費佔政府預算總額自百分之二十五、增至百分之四十三、前途亦無核减之望、該報告稱、各國之海軍費、除德國外、均較戰前爲高、現在各國預算中之軍費、英佔百分之十六、德佔百分之十七、美佔百分之十八意佔百分之二○·八、法佔百分之二二·三、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>僞國問題影響海軍談判</h3>
<p>美日不舉行專家會議</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍預備會議因日本提出新軍縮案、前途頗多難關、現在除軍縮問題外、尙有「滿洲國」機會均等及日英同盟等說發生、會議空氣極有微妙關係、「滿洲國政府」之舉動對於英國有直接利害關係、故一般言論界重視「滿政府一、二十七日各報力說英美兩國政府提出抗議、日滿兩國對此如何處理爲門户開放之試題、實業界方面因「滿政府」新計劃尙未實際運用、不願表示意見、（二十七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英美兩國代表團對於日本軍縮案之意見、現在大體明瞭、美國代表團因日本主張大軍縮案、露骨的表示反對意見、然英政府對於艦型縮少方針之利害關係、與英國不同、故雖反對日本提案、然欲處於調停日英兩國間之地位、英國在專家委員會欲與日本審議艦種别問題、然日代表堅持先議原則之方針、英國對於日本提案出於何種態度、下週會議可以窺知、美國代表團之態度比英强硬、故日美專家委員會暫無舉行希望、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>事誠有之、且仍反對梟首之刑以代槍斃也、此事現已定奪、盤谷政府已不顧王意而行、惟此不足爲王遜位之原因、至於剥奪王上之否决權一事、此間未有所聞」云云、該文牘並代王發言、對新加坡傳來之消息表示駭異、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>汕頭通信、英國將星架坡商埠改爲軍港、其關係於東亞之嚴重性、可以想像而知、頃有星洲報界某君到汕、據談星洲海陸空軍事、正在擴展中、查一八一九年前、萊佛士爵士爲星洲總督時、下令建造一砲臺、僅置八磅及十磅之小砲、且以磚石建一火藥庫及兵房於海岸、兵房僅能容三十名戍兵、同時並設營房兩座、以供偶然事變之用、在海傍又設兩所保護輪船之砲隊兵房、在沙灘嘴設一堡壘、駐砲兵一隊而已、萊佛士以爲在此種防衛設備之外、再在深海中設一瞭望塔、便認爲防衛力量、可以無恐、且其時駐防海峽及明沽連之兵力、僅有孟加里士步兵第廿團之第二營、其指揮官、分駐星洲·檳榔嶼·明沽連三地、庸知時至今日、一切皆改變矣、星架坡乃一小島、面積爲二百二十英方里、海陸空軍、連年日益拓展、當地民衆對此、尙多疑問、究竟星洲地方、將成爲遠東之「馬爾他」乎、抑東方之「直布羅陀乎、或爲全英領海外土中、最强勁之砲壘乎、星架坡今日之設備、是否可以充分抵抗外來海陸空軍之侵襲歟、以上皆南洋人士、對今日星洲所抱之疑問、</p>
<p>今日星洲陸軍、由總司令李榮氏所統轄者、計有步兵一營·砲兵兩旅·以及附設之化學隊·電車隊·高射砲·坦克車·工兵隊·騎兵隊等、警訊隊亦已設立、此外有空軍二中隊之魚雷擲彈機、及速度最快之飛船隊一隊、至西里打軍港内、更有種種設備、但至若何程度始算終點、固無人能知之也、目下駐軍之實力如何、亦無人能曉、大英輪船瑪鑾腦、本係常川航行英澳一綫、取道於哥倫坡者、本年三月東來載有軍官七名、士兵三百名、以補充第一第二兩高射砲隊、本年秋季、又得悉有重砲隊將到星、連以前共有四種砲隊、查連年每一軍事季節、新軍官與士兵遠國際商業電訊</p>

<h3>戰區清理會下月一日成立</h3>
<p>將按步就班做去</p>
<p>戰區可益趨安定</p>

<h3>籌備經過</h3>
<p>黃郛北返後、鑒「戰區」内一切懸而未結各問題、應亟予解决、灤榆薊密兩區專員公署、雖分主其事、但黃仍以時間上事實上種種周章、殊有專設機關負責清理之必要、「戰區」清理委員會之組織、卽發軔於此、經黃召殷同李擇一等詳商結果、决定卽予籌備、該會組織、極爲簡單、所需經費、爲數甚少、</p>
<h3>所負任務</h3>
<p>該會任務、據該會某委員表示、槪分兩點、（一）清理「戰區」内各縣對外對内一切未結事件、（二）指導各縣縣長防範一切糾紛之辦法、關於前者、所謂對外、係向日方接洽日方應履行之事件、所謂對内係注意公安設施、與保安隊訓練之指導、關於後者、厥爲防範一切不幸事件之發生、黃委員長剏辦地方行政人員訓練所、旨卽在此、惟在現狀之下、將先由清理委員會予以指導、如此按步就班做去、則「戰區」情形、當可益趨安定、</p>
<h3>展緩原因</h3>

<h3>委員人選</h3>
<p>委員名單、頃尙未公布、據悉確已决定者、共計七人、卽殷同·李擇一·殷汝耕·陶尙銘·朱式勤·岳開先·許壽生是也、由七人中指定常委三人、由殷同·李擇一·朱式勤担任、常委之下、設主任秘書一人、由王弼侯担任、該會工作人員若于、俱由政整會調用、不另支薪、以節公帑、該會組織條例全文、與委員名單、至遲本月底可分别公布、</p>
<h3>清理期限</h3>

<p>各自爲壘之居民</p>
<p>二十四日發武威、福音堂赫牧師夫婦、將來欲赴新疆、今亦搭車同行、惟聞新路尙阻、擬到酒泉下車、另候機會、上午經郭家舗·四十里舗·懷安驛·昌隆堡·等村落、人民居室、大半荒凉、長行六十餘里、所見田壘、十之六七、因山洪肆虐、全被冲壤、滿舗拳大石子、如隴東之人爲「砂地」、惜不能如砂地之可耕種也、途多碎石、車行顚簛、大小河流、不下二十餘道、渡時誤陷深處、水卽湧入脚坂、浸入車箱油管、而將機油逐出、以致抛錨中流、嗣經他車引退、或雇人拖出、彼行此滯、凡十餘次、至於來往路人、爲便渡河起見、率性將褲脫抱而行、至達目的地時始穿之、旁觀者雖覺不雅、彼等則處之泰然、</p>
<p>自蘭州西至嘉略關、長城邊垣、斷斷續續、與驛道併行、昔惟報告邊警、傳遞消息之烟墩、沿途每五里一組、每組五墩、普通高一立方丈、若在要口及關外戈壁、距離稍遠、有高三四丈、且築營壘於旁者、然以年代久遠、多已坍塌不堪矣、惟武威西部永昌東北鄕、民家散居、尙沿明代備北寇之風、各自爲壘、卽於居室之外、另築圍墻二三道、中建瞭望台、高亦三四憎、形勢緊嚴、儼若江西新建之碉堡等　是日本欲行達永昌、但因泥塗多水、晚抵永昌東鄕之某段道上、卽止而露宿於月下、夜來風吼如雷、翌晨展視、則見左右靑山、已換披雪衣矣、</p>
<p>嗣卽整裝出發、經三十里舗·孫家莊·東岡·各村、於上午十一時、到永昌城、自武威到此、欲傳百六十里、但按汽車里程表、僅三十二英里、約合百零六里、城高三丈、雉碟完固、車入東門、隨出西門、守城槍兵、倉猝見車、未予盤查、且爲敬禮、城之中央、建一樓、高四層、矗立雲霄、額聯無數、東向有曰「民淳俗美」、西向有曰「柔懷西城、」體大筆勁、頗覺精神、夾道植樹、粗纔拱把、枝葉暢茂、蕆蕤可愛、中有高至四丈餘者、古秀尤不多觀、其他寺廟亦甚多、惟街人殊覺寥落耳、</p>
<p>永昌因水利缺乏、地價非常低廉、租地面積、鮮以「斗」「畝」稱、多以「幾晝夜水」計、譬某某莊户等、約共集錢二百五十千文、卽可租獲一晝侂水之地、所謂一晝夜水者、卽俟山洪暴發、在所指租地之範圍内</p>
<p>、莊户得盡量引水灈漑、爲時一晝夜、水至何處、卽爲所租地之四至、是謂「一晝夜水」之租地、俗則簡稱「租一晝夜水、」尙有租一晝夜半水、或二晝夜水以上者、水有大小、地分平斜、所泡地面、自有差别、但據農稱人、普通一晝夜水、所泡之地面、約可播麥種二十石左右、若雨水及時、收成約爲八九十石、（每石麥重三百斤、價三十元、）否則隔年僅得一種、或僅得種其一部份、該地田賦、除正糧歸地主繳納外、餘如每石地、應納軍糧二斗、軍草三百斤、以及其他雜差雜欵、槪歸莊户負責、迨租至十年二十年之定期、地主將押租錢二百五十千文、如數退還莊户、卽行解約、若地面漸耕漸肥、莊户酌納小租、請求續耕、可不退田、然此種情形、多見諸十餘年前、今因水利廢弛、產品銳减、而農民負担、反日益加重、莊户請求續田情事、蓋已絕無而僅有、至於金川流域、河陰翳、水磨聲聞數里、地味膏腴、景象美觀、而地價雖較提高、然亦未見特殊起色也、</p>
<p>永昌西行、十里或十數里、都有村落、地居金川上游、到處靑草碧揚、惟民居大半倒塌、男女衣着、亦襤褸不堪、皆受疊次</p>
<p>灵禍之影響、視之殊覺不忍耳、過空心墩（距城四十餘里）、道旁堅明代將軍張臣紀功碑、苔痕斑斑、傾斜若將仆地、十五里水泉驛、民屋雖多、僅見中年婦五六人</p>
<p>、都帶烟容、肚飢購食、無有賣者、十餘年前、此間爲一有名空宿站、今竟衰敗如此、思之令人寒心、二十里古城窪、漢時曾設日勒縣於此、古堡殘缺、民屋寥寥數間、幾乎全成廢墟、然村東尙正建一高三層之魁星閣、椽柱已架設竣工、但無力覆土蓋瓦、木料已渐漸褪失新色、以若彼凋敝之農村、而猶大事迷信建築、鄕村人民之愚昧固可哀、而鄕村敎育之缺乏尤可懼也、十餘里、南北兩山、漸次接近而成峽、厥名山丹峽、南望焉支山、層峯積雪、蜿蜒若畫、人多統稱祁連山、實亦祁連山之北行支脈也、山上盛產虊材、而以大黃爲最、尙有紅藍、可爲染料之用、昔漢武帝遺將攻取祁連焉支二山、匈奴爲之歌曰、失我祁連山、使我六畜不蕃息、失我焉支山、使我婦女無顏色、</p>
<p>山丹峽形勢險峻、得失極關重要、出峽爲峽口驛、邊垣爲城、居民尙熱鬧、十五里豐城舗、二十五里新河驛、日暮而宿、自永昌至北、途長四十九英里、約合一百六十二里、新河驛屬山丹縣、有土堡、周約三里、已多坍塌、居民百餘家、回人經營商舗、漢人多事耕牧、驟聞車至、羣擁圍觀、中老年人、衣棉衣褐（用羊毛缐織成者、）左肩多縫紅布一塊、大約四方寸、并佩古錢·符錄、用驅病魔、十二三歲之男孩、不着衣褲、項繫鐵質練銷、經冬若不去之、祈福必反以致病、女孩亦褲可不着、惟足則不可不纏、因作放足及破除迷信之勸導、未識彼等領略否也、有關帝廟、殿宇舊朽、所立碑石中、有清道光九年山丹北山漢夷分界一碑、略云、長城邊垣之外、六十里内、漢民仍得採食、六十里以外、卽爲蒙人之住牧地、他如玄天廟·三官殿·等、較關帝廟倒塌更甚、佛像暴露、居民各就像位、另築泥穴以藏之、局</p>

<h3>突然失愼</h3>
<p>昨日下午一時半、該處工人正在抽水間屋上、用火將鉛皮接頭時、不知如何、火星忽落於作房下面之本片上、一經着火頓時延燒、頃刻烈熖飛騰、該作房業已冒穿屋頂、因是項作房一定全用木料所搭致全部被焚、</p>

<h3>綏遠印象</h3>
<p>（續）　許振華</p>
<p>（二）綏西農村中之地獄與天堂，綏遠全省面積一百四十九萬方里，山地佔百分之三十五，沙漠佔百分之二十五，平原僅百分之四十，而一部份平原，又因時受含有齡鹼山水之冲淹，變爲黑鹼地，不宜耕種，其餘亦因氣候雨量之失調，生產力甚爲薄弱，所產五穀雜量僅小麥，糜</p>
<p>米，蕎麥，玉蜀黍等幾種，有時種一畝地之小麥，只收二百斤，每斤價洋二分五厘，合計大洋五元而已，土地價値如此，而又捐稅重重，農民生計，可想而知，鄕野間一片荒凉，往往行四五十里，或一二百里，始見一村，村或二三十家，或四五十家，房屋構造，多爲黃土，間亦有鑿山洞而行窟居者，其法先削山岩斜坡爲平壁·横鑿一二丈深，頂爲拱圓形，窟之一半爲坑，坑旁爲灶，灶以土管接成烟囱，上通山頂，窟之入口爲門，門旁更鑿小孔爲窗，以通光綫，侅僱工鑿窟，普通亦需十二三元一間，與建土房，所費相等，農民衣料·夏則土布，冬則羊皮，食品以小麥，審麥，糜米，羊肉爲主，至於白麵，價格稍昂，只欵待上賓時偶爾用之，非日常所食也，村民之衣食住，如此簡單，計一人一日所費，値洋五分而已，然多數農民猶家無隔夜糧，記者一行十餘人，於赴崑多崙召途中，曾投宿一小村，名因六窰子，晚間購買食糧時，村民竟謂五六家中，所有餘糧，不足十人一餐，其生活貧困至此，直不　人間地獄矣。</p>
<p>但在綏西此等地獄般農村中，有時竟發現塔尖高聳之西式洋樓，四周圍以城堡，槍砲警備森</p>
<p>嚴，盜匪不敢正視，室中設備，堂皇富麗，電燈，沙發，地毬，鋼琴，無綫電，舉凡都市中最新之物質享受，無不應有盡有，與一般村民日常生活相比，眞無異地獄中之天堂，借度此天堂生活者，均爲西僑，國人則絕尠也。綏西之天主敎勢力（非基督敎），實不容吾人忽視，全綏遠現不有敎徒五萬人，敎堂四十八所，隱隱之中，社會上之經濟權，政治權，敎育權，均操於敎堂之乎，每一敎堂，均有大批地產，如薩拉齊縣之五神宮村敎堂，有地百頃，小巴拉蓋村敎堂有地五百頃，包頭之山洱兒村敎堂，有地二百頃，耕種敎堂土地者，悉爲敎民，收租辦法，三七分成，敎堂簙得三成，佃户得七成，國稅由敎堂担負，地方稅爲村公所公費，修築堡壘費，及各種雜捐，由佃户担負，敎堂中之神交父即爲大地主，一年收穫甚豐。敎育方面，在綏西一帶鄕間，國人自辦之學校，寥若晨星，間有一二私塾，小學，亦多殘缺不全，設備簡陋，天主敎區内之鄕間，則大多於敎堂内附設學校，今以薩縣之二十四頃地村爲例，該村共有居户百餘，人口二千，而敎民佔十分之九以上，敎堂有地一百十頃，創辦男女初中各一所，男女完全小學各一所，男幼稚院一所，敎職員共二十餘人，内比國女敎師五人，專授法文，數學，理化，男女學生六百餘，此外又設有孤女院一所，凡貧家女嬰，父母無力赡養者，敎堂爲之收養，供衣食，授敎育，此等女子，長大後，多終身爲天主敎服務，以二千人口之一小材，敎育發達如此，誠屬可驚，今全村識字者，已有十分之七，男女兒童，無一失學，數年之後，將全村盡成智識份子，惟此等智識份子，係由天主敎所造成，心目中但知神父，而不知有國，記者曾問一年約十齡之高小學生曰，你是那裏人，對曰二十四頃地，又問二十四頃地歸那一國管，而該生竟膛目不知所答，小學敎育如此，亦痛心事也。敎區人民之無知者，惟神父之言是從，即敎外人，一聞神父二字，亦莫不談虎色變，記者於薩縣之某小村中，曾親見一敎民因觸神父之怒，跪地叩首求恕，而神父則怒目呵責，狀至凶暴，敎區中之神父，實無異一地之酋長，新近陜北三邊農，民因不堪法國神父虐待，派代表赴西安，請求收回敎區土地，嗣由陜省府派員到北平，恊同冀晋察綏陜五省外交專員靳志，與法方交涉，法方要求以原價三分之二由中國贖回，此事交涉，迄今尙在進行中，按三邊爲安邊，定邊，靖邊，地本屬綏逮，今歸陜西管轄，庚子拳亂時，有法國天主敎士爲富地人民所殺，翌年法與陜甘總督交涉，將三邊土地一方劃與法人建築敎堂，法人得寸進尺，國佔民地，復自收租稅，處理人民爭訟，侵佔民地益廣，儼若其殖民地，天主敎堂勢力，亦爲西北問題之一，宰國人注意及之。（未完）</p>

<p>開幕禮節仿照遠東運動會秩序</p>
<p>（本報駐菲特約記者顔文初寄）</p>
<p>岷里刺華僑自組織全菲華僑體育恊進會後、丵對運動提倡不遺餘力、本屆雙十節、特籌備國慶運動大會、其發出宣言如左、</p>
<p>在此國難期中、而欲過事舗張、爲祝國慶、不特多數僑胞中、無此興高采烈心理、即居留地人士、或且以我不知痛定思痛、故際斯國慶期屆、爲欲稍事點綴、惟有提倡運動會、於臥薪嘗膽中、爲訓練驕健體魄之舉、則有用之精神·金錢·與時間、始不投於虚牝、（中略）竊念國民爲國家份子、際斯國難當頭、非有强健體魄、誠不足以捍身而衛國、歐戰後德國爲凡兩賽宮和約所束縛、不能盡量爲軍事訓練、即代以大規模之體育運動、我國現際處境、雖不若當時德國到山窮水盡地步、然國民體質孱弱、較之德人、何啻霄壤、所期他日收復失地、報讐雪恥、非文弱身體、所能從事、則此雙十節運動會之目的、非徒在競爭一日揣手短長、奪此錦標已也、爲欲作有實效之提倡、而華僑體育恊進會、即由此開其端、願我僑胞以業餘寳貴光陰、從事於體魄鍜鍊、稗他日結回國、參加祖國全國運動會、或且得遴派選手出席世界萬國運動會、則將來僑界體育進步、亦可謂由此雙十節開其端矣、（下略）</p>
<p>（一）成立籌備委員會宣言旣由華僑體育恊會發出、即成立國慶運動大會籌備委員會、舉華僑敎育會會長楊啟泰爲主席、聘前曁南大學體育主任陳掌諤爲緦幹事、分設經濟·競賽·獎品·宣傳·整隊·審判·各組委員會、皆函請僑界商·學·報界各智議分子加入、於十月一日開始辦公、期限甚逼、幸各組皆加速率進行、故皆有條不紊、</p>
<p>（二）各社團及敎育界踴躍加入在岷里刺各種球類組織、本極發達、故報名參加者、三十五單位、共六十四隊、關於足球·計九隊、關於籃球·計十五隊、關於排球·計男子九隊、女子三隊、關於網球·計六隊、關於游泳·計四隊、又個人加入二人、關於田徑賽·計七隊、又個人加入八人、除缺欠棒球Ｂsse　Ball與國衛外、可謂應有盡有、具有遠東運動會、與全國運動會雛形、各隊選手合計六百餘人、惜因籌備時間大爲急促、故州府及外埠各華僑團體、無由加入、亦大可惜也、</p>
<p>（三）開幕時之盛况大會於國慶日下午二時半、假座黎撒新運動塲、（即遠東大會足球塲）行開幕典禮、門外中美菲三國旗飄、演台上亦佈滿國徽、並設無綫電放音機、故演講及報告成績時、聲音傳佈、清楚可聽、至塲之中央、足球塲及跑徑、均修理完整、分外悅目、四週觀衆、均能一覽無遺、開幕時屆、各隊選手、按照拈團次序、先排列於塲外空地、然後由二三六團童子軍軍樂隊、高奏進行曲領導於前、華僑中學·中西學校·中山學校·靑年會各童子繼之、次爲第一女學參加表演女生隊、次爲女選手隊、次爲各社團加入男選手隊、環繞全塲一週、軍樂攸揚、步伐整齊、全塲觀衆、氣象亦十分嚴肅、繼集中司令臺前、司儀宜佈開會、首由童子軍樂隊奏黨國歌、次吹號升大會旗、再由大會會長楊啟泰佈告</p>
<p>開會宗旨、略謂當此國難時期、提倡體育、乃救國根本要圖、蘥必有健全之國民、而後有健全之國家此次因籌備時間短促、而各界參加、至爲踴躍、即遠在碧瑤之僑胞亦派隊與會、此種精神、令人欽佩無已云云、</p>
<p>（四）中華駐菲鄧總領事演說略謂運動有三要點、一爲大家鍜鍊自已體魄、以應付環境、二大家應有合作精神、三應服從評判、互相切磋云云、（五）由菲律賓體育恊會代表現任交通部長亞拉氏演說、略謂菲律賓體育恊會、自然鼓勵及促進旅菲人士之體育精神、又中菲二國在地球上同一隅、彼此友誼系統上、均有密切關係、中菲人民、均不欲亦不能打破此密切關係云</p>
<p>、（六）各隊選手代表誓詞、（僑中代表女選手）開幕典禮旣畢、各項田徑决賽、即在萬目睽睽之下舉行、其足球塲中、則有第一女學校表演亞鈴操與手巾舞、爲引起觀衆之雅興焉、</p>
<p>（五）開始運動此次大會籌備時間匆促、未能提前舉行决賽、而田徑賽因種種關係、又欲在一天結束、故分爲上午豫賽、下午决賽之折衷辦法、上午各田徑選手、齊集黎撒運動塲、在烈日之下、舉行豫賽、各選手因豫賽有奪取决賽之權、莫不努力應賽、豫賽時各隊參加人數多者、分爲若干組、每組首三名、成績最佳、得决賽權、故上午除一萬米賽跑、及四百米接力爲决賽外、其餘决賽、皆在下午行開幕典禮後舉行、而不遠千里而麩來之碧瑤華僑靑年會足球隊、與岷埠華僑尙義社足球隊、同時在塲上作友誼的表演、碧瑤隊因乘夜坐長途汽車、無充分睡眠時間、亦不得實地練習機會、故以○對六之比、敗於尙義、五點後、爲南精對靑南足球比賽、雙方皆實力雄厚、上半塲各無所獲、下半塲南精攻進一球、乃距完塲十五分鐘間、評判員以天色黑暗、不能再戰、宣告停賽、未予判决、大會最高裁判委員會、照章取消下半塲、重予以比賽時間云、</p>
<p>（六）觀衆之踴躍黎撒運動塲、距華僑市區近、來往小摩託車賽一元、國慶日各商户、過半未停交易、而是日觀衆三千餘人、（門票分三角一角）恐菲人見有此大規模組織、益生疑忌、故除少數與體育塲有關係者、請其參加外、全不敢在外報宣傳、自開幕典禮行後、僑界對體育印象極佳此地市政府在星期日、不許營業、將來即以推廣體育、爲打破僑界靑年不正當之娛樂云、</p>
<p>（七）各項比賽現積極進行開幕日除田徑决賽及足球比賽二塲外、其餘各種運動、因各選乎職業關係、不能效遠運會繼續進行、祗擇星期六夜·及星期日夜、分類舉行、大槪足球·籃球·排球·加入者多、其比賽法、用淘汰制兼循環制、即各項各甲乙兩組、各自循環比賽、然後以各組優勝第一二隊再循環比賽、預排日期、須至耶誕節前、方能閉幕云、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗起伏範圍小</h3>

<p>據日商某洋行調查、九月份上海棉紗存底共計九萬○七百八十包、較八月底减少一萬四千六百六十一包、其中九月份日紗存底爲一萬七千三百六十五包、較八月份增加一千七百六十四包、華英紗存底爲七萬三千一百四十五包、較八月底减少一萬六千四百二十五包、日紗之增加、由於原棉高貴、不欲將製品廉價出售、華廠紗因中秋結賬關係、各廠多頭廣價賣出、故存量大爲减少、一方面因深秋天冷、需要轉旺、銷路遂見起色、茲將支數存量統計列下、（單位包）</p>

<h3>糧食滙率關係標粉昂騰</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈一致堅騰之象、以洋麥報價芝加哥坎拿大兩處均微好一角左右、當開價時業内外人心、以匯率之一時不易平落、對於此後現麥定貨、恐難接近、兼之本月份距交割已近、廠家籌碼、仍逐步收回、因此開價娐好、以後各盤、即見買氣甚湧、市面步步上升、迨至下午開盤、本月份因廠方續好、一部份人心、更甚濃厚、因此喊價步步高昂、查此次之高漲、大部分原因、純爲白銀加稅以後、金價横跳、遂致影響物價之上升、故此後之轉變、與匯率實大有關係也結果本月份高漲五分半、十一月份漲四分半、十二月份漲三分二厘半、一月份漲三分七厘半、二月份漲三分半、三月份漲三分七厘半、</p>
<h3>近期麥抵空獨漲七分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平定之態、以洋麥報價、祗好一角左右、當開價後、交易未見暢旺、市面上落無幾、迨至下午開盤、初尙平定、旋以粉市繼續高漲、市塲人心、又爲帶振、各月份買氣熱鬧、市面步佳、本月份又爲交易最後一日、空户多數抵補、市百曾高至八角二分、遠期人心雖佳、終恐洋麥之接近、故業外人未敢放胆收買也、結果本月份漲七分、十一月份漲四分、十二月份漲五分、一月份漲三分、二月份漲三分、現麥市面、連擯多日、昨始做開、以標粉麥步堅、喊價亦高起三五分不等、開山東麥三元八角半、徐州麥三元八角三分、瑤灣六合麥三元八角、江北麥三元七角四分、計一萬包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>支加哥小麥初因國外電訊不良、利物浦市價跌二便士、多頭從事了結、價格下跌、入後以澳洲收成消息惡劣、聞該淫雨爲災、於是空方大起恐慌、從事抵補、市價挻進、逆糾市價將更行回</p>

<h3>河下米市亦無精彩</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源轉稀、祗到二十餘號（貨共三千餘石）、人心略堅、惟銷塲方面、本街仍平常、客帮續有靑島烟台等帮採納五六百包、故市形僅能轉定、其餘窰種六種及白稻野稻等厚新粳、與夫杜洋尖等價、悉都無甚上落、變陰元各無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到頭十八九艘、市上各色銷胃、新更窰種早市呆滯、午市微俏、破粳尙稱活絡、陳白元酒户續化、新羊尖胃溶仍化、新杜尖新陳埠客尖平常、市形新更高料疲格、中次軟數分、陳白元加起一二角、窰種高貨定立、中次小一二角、新羊尖加角外、破更新杜尖陰元新陳埠客尖價形平定、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>糖市提莊靑突漲半元</h3>
<p>丨受匯兌的支配丨</p>
<p>昨日糖市因値週六、今日無裝出交易寥寥、越勢更見軟弱、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨普通呌十八元八角、本棧貨十八元九角、稍有交易轉中貨呌五元七角、八九號荷赤划十四元二角半、小去五分、轉口貨因前日有致到萬餘件、市勢驟鬆、降去二角半、划五元一角半、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌原盤、無交易、本廠綿白又呈步跌局面、昨振裕一號十七元三角、小去一角、潮帮號家開出新到白色提靑九十四包、價爲十三元半、突升三角、查地價因汕頭匯水大縮、現爲一千○五十餘元、較前縮去（比最高率）八十元外、以匯水按算、每擔須加高元許、故申汕市價、又入倒懸地步、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>薄馬口鐵銷路活躍</p>
<p>三十五磅薄馬口鐵、近來客帮若汕頭天津諸帮、均有採辦市象、已不若先前之冷落、而本街味精廠香烟公司等亦盡量收買、故數日中開出有二百餘箱之多、行情扶搖直上、每箱開至五十五元、比前好起一元、查新近海外定價極高、而同業購定者極少、後市市貨頗有不够分銷之槪、綠其趨勢方面、殊甚樂觀也、</p>

<h3>志向</h3>
<p>— 玲</p>
<p>志向是每人都有的，志向也是無窮盡的，有了這個志向，還有那個志向；小時有小的志向，大了有大的志向；無論大的志向，小的志向，志向中再有志志向，志向如了願，又再產生新志向，一直不斷的，除非你死了，志向才停止，但是志向仍没有成功。</p>
<p>世界的演進，不會停止，他發明了這樣東西，别人更發明了比他還要有益於世界的東西，這樣斷續不斷的發明，使世界的文化不斷的進步；現在世界文化進步到這樣的好，恐怕不久的將來一定要進步到比現在還要好。</p>
<p>一個人的希望，也不會斷絕的，小的時候，希望是很小的，但是長大後，希望自然而然的會大起來。總之，年歲越高，希望更大，所以人類的希望，也不會停止的</p>
<p>我們的國父孫中山先生，他的一生，做了很多而很偉大的事業，到他逝世的時候，革命的志向還没有完全成功。</p>
<p>我們做任何事情，若說志向成功，便是没有志向，小朋友，你們記着吧。</p>
<h3>世界名人的童年</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>▲愛迪生</p>
<p>後前没有電燈，到晚上暗騰騰的多少不方便：從前没有電話，電報，要和遠處的朋友們通消息，多少不方便：從前没有電車，交通又是多少不方便。從這些東西發明以後，我們享受了多少幸福，後來發明了活動有聲電影，我們又不知得了多少的愉快，小朋友們可知道這些東西的發明人是誰呢？他就是世界最大發明家愛迪生。</p>
<p>愛迪生雖然是個偉大的發明家，但他小時候却不曾受過怎樣高深的敎育，他僅僅在小學校中讀過三個月的書、因爲他對於所受的敎育，感覺不到興趣，所以學校中的課程一點不注意，以致成續異常惡劣，結果就被學校開除了。以後祗是他母親就他的個性敎他讀書，給了他極良好的敎育。</p>
<p>他從小注重實騐，無論什麽事情，都要經過實騐，才肯深信。他知道母鷄會孵卵，他也曾經去親自實騐過，把許多鷄蛋，擺在草堆裏，自已也倣效母鷄一樣把身體去伏在上而孵，這雖然近乎是笑話，但他的實騐精神，於此可見一班了。</p>
<p>愛迪生喜歡化學，也從幼小時候開始了，十一歲的時候，在地下室中闢了一間小小的化學試騐室，整天廢寢忘食地在地上室中從事化騐的工作。有條不紊，眞和理化實騐室一樣的佈置得很整齊，這些就是他後來成爲大發明家的根基，我們千切不能忽視他的。</p>
<p>愛迪生享壽八十四歲，發明的東西，大大小小，一共有一千多種，對世界，是創造了無數的利益啊。</p>

<h3>民族英雄岳飛</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>岳飛，誰都知道他是一個英雄，他是宋朝人，那時金兵和現在的日本一樣的打到中國來，要想奪了宋朝的江山，把中國捉去了兩個太子，金國的大將金兀术，帶了十萬大兵，浩浩蕩蕩，殺到中國來，一路勢如破竹，守土的將士們死的死了、降的降了。那時出了一個岳飛，他從小便是一個勇敢的好孩子，從小便抱了愛國的志向，他的母親把他背上刺了「精忠報國」四個大字，他那時看見國家危險萬分了，就起來抵抗金兵，屢戰屢勝，後來皇帝封了他做大元帥，他便領了大兵，好像猛虎添翼一般，殺得金兀术，大敗而逃，復國指日可待。可恨那時有一個奸臣秦檜，在皇帝面前進了讒言，將岳飛用十二道金牌召回，在風波亭害死了。</p>
<p>小朋友！現在的中國比宋朝時候的中國更危險了！日本帝國主義這樣的長驅直入，可憐竟没有像岳飛這樣的好男兒來阻擋！</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們努力罷！我願你們立定救國的志向，來做岳飛第二！</p>

<h3>幾種特異的魚</h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>我們知道，這地球上，無論陸地動物，水族動物，和植物，很多特異的。</p>
<p>今天同小朋友們先來研究幾種特異的魚：</p>
<p>一，水彈魚　水彈魚都產在東印度地方的淡水裏，體長五六寸，形狀扁的。水彈魚在游泳的時候，常把頭伸出水面，身體斜直着。在這時候，如果見到一種飛虫在水面飛過，便吸了一口水，用足力氣，噴射到飛蟲身上去，飛蟲因没有防備，給射落在水裏，水彈魚就把它當做了食糧。</p>
<p>二，飛魚　飛魚喜住在海裏各處暖的地方。飛魚身體很小，最大的要算美國加利福尼地方的，也只十八时長左右。飛魚飛的時候，大槪被敵人迫逐得没法躱避了，纔用力撥動尾兒，衝出水面，在空中飛着，約飛了二百碼仍舊落到水裏，飛魚並不像飛鳥般常在空中飛行的。</p>
<p>三，巢魚　巢魚在歐美是一種常見的魚類。體狹長側扁，背脊上有兩個或三個棘刺的，都住在淡水裏，背脊上有十個或十五個棘刺的，都住在海洋裏。巢魚在造巢時候，總擇泥底的凹處地方，做造巢的塲所，然後纔將水底所有的枯葉，草莖等纖維的東西作造巢材料。</p>
<p>四，帆魚　帆魚產於太平洋，印度洋，及大西洋的西部。帆魚是一種大魚，體長竟在六尺以外。背上的鰭，豎出於水面像帆，所以我們呌它做帆魚。帆魚的上顎，長如一把劍，帆魚就把這東西當做捕食及防禦的利器。</p>
<p>五，鮟鏮魚　鮟鱇魚都住在海底，我國沿海出產很多。體長五尺左右，頭部大，身體漸小，直小到尾部。在鮟鱇魚頭部的上顎上，生逢着三根觸鬚，兩根上端尖的，一根上端有一塊很小的瓣膜。小朋友，這根生有瓣膜的觸鬚，眞像漁翁的釣竿，那瓣膜就是香餌，祗要這觸鬚搖動，遠遠的小魚，都以爲吃的東西，游近這鬚來，鮟鱇魚就把這觸鬚縮近嘴邊，等小魚離嘴邊近了，它就張口呑下。</p>
<p>小朋友，左圖裏就是五種特異的魚的形狀：</p>
<h3>柳</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>團團的一個圓池，池的四周，栽着四五株的垂柳，一絲絲的柔條下垂着，織成了一張自然的翠緑的簾子。</p>
<p>每天早晚，常有一雙雙一對對的鳥兒，在柳蔭中唱着悅耳的歌曲，直到驚動了它們，它們才很伶俐的飛開去了。</p>
<p>在夏天，一隻一隻的蟬，躱在幾株柳條上，哼着「知了知了」整天的鬧個不了。到得秋風一起，葉兒一片一片的飄下，那蟬聲也隨着消滅了。</p>
<p>這一片片的黃葉，從樹上飄到池裏，水面上好像蓋上了一張淡黃的絨氈。池裏的游魚，三三兩兩，每見一片黃葉飄到水面，當作是食物，便很快的游過去爭吃了。</p>
<p>在夏天晚上，天空中蔚藍得没有一片雲，雪白的明月，隱隱的躱在柳梢頭，旁邊還鑲着幾點閃閃的明星。在那兩株垂柳的主幹上掛了一張紅緑條紋布的吊牀，我就躺在這吊牀上，搖來搖去，看看明月，吹吹凉風，多麽爽快呀！</p>
<p>忽有一件小東西，着在我的臉上，我疑是什麽飛蟲，用手一摸，原來是一片柳葉，它也來給我報個信，說是秋天已經來了。</p>
<p>柳！可愛的垂柳！什麽人都願意和它做朋友的。現在夏天雖然過去了，而我時常還是戀戀不捨的要在柳蔭下徘徊一會兒。</p>
<h3>敎堂模型的製法</h3>
<p>— 景元</p>
<p>小朋友們！猜想你們在學校裏是已經學過剪裁的工藝了吧？我有許多小朋友告訴我他們對於小工藝是感覺到特别的興趣，其實又何嘗祗是他們幾個感覺到特别的興趣呢？世界上成羣的小朋友多同樣地感覺到興趣。因爲它能啟發兒童的科學思想，又能展示兒童的研究能力，所以小工藝對於兒童敎育的關係是很密切的。這裏讓我來介紹一間極簡單的敎堂模型的製法給你們，可以倣照了去試做一下。</p>
<p>材料：馬糞紙一塊··尺一柄，小刀一把膠水一瓶，朱紅色油光紙一張。</p>
<p>製法：先把馬糞紙砌成如圖一，二，三，三種平面雛形，不過如圖三所示的黑色大門是要砌去的。同時在三張圖裏的虚綫，是指明當砌的時候，應該輕輕地不要把它砌斷，祗要有一條刀痕便於摺疊就好了。（倘若要製大一點的話，那可以照上面的圖依比例放大幾倍就是了。）然後把砌好的拼起來，如圖四所示。再拿紙條兒在裂縫處貼好，乾後再拿油光紙很細心的貼上去。至於頂上的十字架，可以用細鉛絲製就揷進去，完成一所精美的禮拜堂。</p>
<h3>西沙米在那裏</h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>從前閱讀童話，記得有一個故事··大槪是在一座山中·有一個奇怪的洞，那兩扇洞門常是關閉着的，除非你會說一句術語，高呌一聲：「西沙米快開」，牠才會開。這洞裏有無數的金銀寳貝，其時有一人得了仙人的指示，他把洞裏的金銀寳貝裝了幾蔴袋，以驢馬杭育杭育的運了出來，當時我看了就覺得非常艷羡，心想那裏有仙人也來指示我一下才好呢！這種幻想，我想童年時代的弟妹們，或許是有一般的同感吧</p>
<p>小朋友們不要說，這是一個謎了嗎？其實，說穿了你們方知道這是一個極容易猜的謎，那末謎底是什麽呢？就是我們的家庭。</p>
<p>誰都有家庭哪！恐怕小朋友們天天在家庭裏，大多數感覺不到家庭的好處？這也難怪你們啦！吃慣了甜東西的人，也不會知道苦是怎樣的味兒了啊。</p>
<p>我們只要想想：我們的學費，除了我們自已的家庭，别的家庭肯替我們擔負嗎？我們每天吃飯，睡覺，奔向别的家庭裏去，永久享受，辦得到嗎？最最愛你的，還不是你們自已家庭裏的人嗎？家庭裏有無量的溫馨情愛，這些就是無數的金銀寳貝，或許比金銀寳貝更値錢；因爲把金銀寳貝也換不動可寳貴的家庭中的溫馨情愛呀！所以我現在明白「西沙米」的寳洞，就是我們的家庭，我們的家庭裏有比「西沙米」更寳貴的東西，我們身在寳洞之中，不要自已不知道呀，小朋友們！</p>
<h3>動物也能遊戲嗎！</h3>
<p>— 沛芳</p>
<p>咱們小朋友，天性活潑，没有不喜歡遊戲的，拍拍皮球，踢踢揵子，盪盪鞦韆，放放風箏，着着各種的兒童棋，都是課餘没事時候，常常玩要的事。卽如聖人孔子，小時候也喜歡陳設俎豆：所以後來長大，喜歡研究禮樂等事，成功一位聖人。老萊子年紀七十多歲，常着了五綵斑斕的衣服，在他的父母膝前，作種種的遊戲，弄得父母哈哈大笑。明初，大儒王冕，雖然喜歡讀書，但他常坐在佛膝上讀書，不是他也喜歡遊戲嗎？這幾位聖賢　，尙且喜歡遊戲，遊戲不是無益的事，可以證明了。</p>
<p>人的天性，喜歡遊戲；動物的天性，亦然。咱有一天，登山遊玩，瞧見兩隻甲殼，蟲扛了一顆泥丸，在地上轉動，很像咱們踢皮球，打籃球一般，十分好看。咱想：這是它們正在遊戲，不要捉它，敗它清興。原來這個甲殼蟲，名呌「蜣螂轉丸」不是莊周早已說過的嗎？</p>
<p>咱們常常畜幾頭白鼠在籠裏，籠裏裝設二架鐵絲做的車輪。這幾頭白鼠，吃飽了没得事做，必定爬上車輪，把前脚拚命地來推動，好像農夫戽水一般，俗名呌做打秋千。這不是白鼠的遊戲嗎？</p>
<p>遊戲只要不過度，便是有益衛生，活血脈，助消化，最是有益呢。古人瞧了「熊經鳥申，」這樣的遊戲動作，便發明了「拳術」，拳術也是遊戲的一類，且能健身禦敵咧。小朋友們，學幾套「拳術」玩玩吧！</p>
<h3>鉛筆</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>距今約四百年以前，英國康白蘭特地方的礦山，發見了一種黑鉛，當時礦中的工人，把黑鉛塗抹地上，覺得很潤黑明晰，因此遂轟動了全國，各處都爭奇購買這黑鉛，英政府也公布法律，禁止黑鉛輸出國外，黑鉛的寳貴，竟比墨汁墨水還要珍重，一時富豪名人，差不多用黑鉛寫信，認爲最摩登的。這黑鉛就是今日我們日常所用鉛筆的祖先，其後有一位法國人名康德者Ｃonte用粘土混了黑鉛，燒成現今所用鉛筆的芯，這是鉛筆改良第一步的成功。後來德國的巴伐里亞·奥大利的菩海米亞·印度的舍龍·墨西哥等地方，也漸漸發見黑鉛，於是鉛筆遂風行全球了，從前看作很珍貴的物口，祗有富豪們理用的東西，到了這時，也不稀奇，逐漸的普及到一般人了。我國的鉛筆，首自日本輸入，約在四址年以前，因爲日本明治三十年仿製鉛筆後，即陸續輸入我國，以前雖有少數人使用，可是都爲幾家洋行裏的私用品。脫到鉛筆的製法，是什麽樣呢？我把簡單的乎續，說明一下：</p>
<p>（一）筆桿，鉛筆桿的材料，產於美國西達地方，是一種蔭森士木，木質細緻鬆脆，除了美國外，各國所出的，都不及它，日本貨是北海道產的阿拉木代用，我國所用的上等材料，也是從美國輸入的最多，製桿之法，先把木板烘乾，除去板中的水分，放在斷木機上截成細長的桿形，再用鑿孔機，鑽成筆芯的溝，然後用膠汁拚合，加電熱乾燥，灌入筆芯，再放削軸機上，銼成圓形或六角形。</p>
<p>（二）筆芯，製造鉛筆的芯，乎續很煩，因爲芯是用黑鉛，粘土，炭素等材料鍊成的，其配合成分的多少，有硬軟的分别，黑鉛的成分多的鉛筆軟，爲３Ｂ、４Ｂ、等，Ｂ即表黑而軟的意義，粘土成分多的鉛筆爲硬，如Ｈ、２Ｈ之類，Ｈ表硬而淡的意義，ＨＢ爲不軟硬，其他有７Ｂ、７Ｈ、等鉛筆，那是特别用的，調製筆芯，須費一星期工夫，先把粘土與黑鉛炭素等成分配好，放在石臼中，每日搗拌，等到鍊合後，用棒調布得極薄匀凈，以没有細粒爲度，用灌芯機裝入細孔中，灌好筆芯後，再放在鍋中，密封烘乾，至于五色鉛筆的筆芯成分，爲顔料粉，粘土，蠟等混和所製的，與黑鉛筆製法不同之點，就是不放在鍋中烘乾，各種鉛筆等筆芯灌好後，最後塗上紅黃緑等顔色漆，可是塗漆的手續，亦很麻煩，普通須用塗軸機塗漆八次，才能顯出美麗的色彩，等到塗漆完畢，用切桿機，截斷一定長度，最後用電　機，燙上各種商標記號，照這樣看起來，我們平常所用的鉛筆，外觀好像很簡單，其實經過種種複雜手續啊</p>

<h3>「流浪少女日記」讀後感</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>丨吳似鴻作現代版丨</p>
<p>這年頭，有人勸娜拉回家，說婦女的責任在家庭裏和床舗上，我現在推藨這本『流浪少女日記。』</p>
<p>同時在生與死，光明與黑暗打得不可開交的今日，我又覺得對於這具有戰鬥性的『流浪妇日記』作一點儉察，對於作者的戰略作一點批評也不是浪費的事情。</p>
<p>這本書包含着『流浪少女日記』，「毛姑娘」，還鄕紀」，「羅娜」四個短篇。第一篇是日記，「毛姑娘」和「羅娜」是小說，「還鄕記」是散文。</p>
<p>作者在全書裏揷入一種對於現狀的澈底的反感，這一個正確的前提無疑的給予了本書以價値。縱然流浪少女並不足以使我們模效，但對於那些抱着敬意來眺望自已身上的鎖鍵的人們和那些默然讓别人把鎖鍵加到她身上來的人們當是新鮮血球的輸入。不過，我們知道，没有認識的行動固然是瞎的，認識了而盲動，也實在不能恭維，不但無補於實際，並且他的認識也必然成問題。作者對於她所憎厭的現狀採取了何種戰略呢？這是値得我們注意的，這裏，作者就頗使我們惋惜了，因爲作者一貫地走了個人主義的道路。</p>
<p>「她順着脚步兒，孤孤零零的走，</p>
<p>像人生之毫無目的。」</p>
<p>「明天就走？</p>
<p>到什麽地方去？</p>
<p>在路上走着的時候再想吧丨丨丨丨反正一切事情都受着命運的支配的。</p>
<p>作者是何等樣的人，自已說得很清楚了。感情不在理智控制下活動，無凖備，無計劃，而且是孤零零的好！對於生活缺少暖氣，對於且的失去了一種確信，（我相信作者走她的路，是意識着某種目的的。）結果是「茫無頭緒」，甚至吾們自已的運命交託給命運！</p>
<p>「茫無頭緒」的人除掉相信命運外，還常常易於走入這樣一個極端，即是對於一切的否定。</p>
<p>「「這惡毒的世界没有一個不是近視眼，沙眼，或完全盲眼。·············」</p>
<p>作者對於一切的否定，是對於這惡毒的世界還未曾認議清楚的緣故。世上儘多近視眼，沙眼，盲眼，但是你假使說「没有一個不是」近視眼，沙眼，盲眼，那是因爲代首先眼睛害了毛病的緣故。「暴雨梨花」那張影片裏談瑛說過這樣一句話：「「我所見到的只是黑暗！」」因爲談瑛扮的是一個盲子。</p>
<p>雖然作者的感情格富於發酵性。她不斷的昂奮，不斷的掙扎，但眼睛害了毛病，一切的企圖常常只是安慰安慰自已的空論。</p>
<p>「「唉，一切都不必管他，我非努力自已去建造戤個世界不可。」」分明作者把個人的力量佔計的過份了。</p>
<p>「毛姑娘」在四個短篇中是最成切的一篇。雖然主角毛姑娘未免太理想化了一點，尤其在後面的描寫。</p>
<p>「丨丨我不知道怎麽會要瘦起來的。飯吃是要吃，不過有時吃了要嘔。</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>丨丨我不曉得怎麽會嘔，也不曉得什麽病。祗是想吃酸的東西。</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>「丨丨有時候肚子會動。」</p>
<p>「丨丨······癩子死了之後誰到你牀上睡過？</p>
<p>丨丨隔壁三嬸的女兒。······</p>
<p>丨丨還有誰？</p>
<p>丨丨我也忘記了，日子已經很長，恐怕是嘉福司務吧。」</p>
<p>作者爲了要强調毛姑娘的渾樸，爲了要購得讀者對毛姑娘最大的同情，筆端帶了極詼諧的氣分，把毛姑娘寫成笑話中的𤛔大姐，將嚴肅的題材冲淡了。毛姑娘不是精神病患者，那樣的描寫不是過火的有損眞實了麽？</p>
<p>然而「毛姑娘」畢竟還是比較成功的，無論在技巧上，在題材的把握上，在故事的結構上。除掉上面一點微小的疏忽，這篇作品幾乎是無可疵議了。</p>
<p>「還鄕記」也寫得很流利爽快，尤其是和同學們的對白。這完全是活生生的事實，吳女士那樣的還鄕是勇敢的，離家也是勇敢的。這裏跳躍着一個潑刺的，不甘屈服，不甘就範的女子。不過個人主義，浪漫和虚無的色彩，這裏也依然很强烈。吳女士誠不失爲英雄，但這一英雄是孤軍。「管他呢」「管他呢」的精神固可佩服，但這是不能解决問題的。要和這惡毒的社會鬥爭你必須管管這社會，必須首先去認識牠。</p>
<p>最後一篇「羅娜」不能不說是一篇失敗的作品。故事的組織很不近情理，結束得又鬆懈而朦朧。羅娜旣早有離開家庭的决心，何必那樣委屈求全的等待到上城才逃跑呢？在草蓬子裏吹口琴，賣花生米而到音樂學校裏去上課，都矯情得過份。和少年的奇異戀愛，更荒誕可笑。最後放進秋姑這一人物，描寫得使人不解。羅娜到底走的是什麽話，也没有暗示出來，結束的毫無精彩。</p>
<p>我們的吳女士穿着到處有人圍着看的衣服，「梳着兩只小辯子」，說些女子們不敢說的話；作品中的羅娜，在草蓬子裏吹口琴，惹得「没事做的男女小孩都攏來看她」，「窮到這種地步，還要吹那不能當飯吃的琴。」使人們想到十八世紀法蘭西浪漫派藝術家們的紅襯衫，長髮，盡量蒼白的臉。這種在形式上儘量地怪僻，表明對於現社會生活形態的否定之理想化，本來也未可厚非；但是你只在形式上做功夫，實際上對於現社會未損毫髮，就變做要不得的了</p>
<p>普得汗諾夫說：『倘若浪漫派底藝術作品，曾因牠底作在對於資產階級的叛逆而得到許多的利益，則從一方面，牠們由於這個叛逆底實際的無内容，蒙了不少的損失了。』吳女士雖不是那樣的浪漫派藝術家，但是這批評對於她也還是相當的適用的。</p>
<h3>娼妓問題</h3>
<p>— 姚斐</p>
<p>自從上海公共租界大捕「雉妓」以來，娼妓問題，頓又引起社會注意，所謂廢娼，禁娼，救娼，肅清雉妓，等等呼聲，不斷地散見大小報紙，關於這個問題，當「五四運動」之後，也曾經討論過一番，然而在廢，禁，或救這些觀點上，結論是一致，可是怎樣去做才有實效，却並汉得着圓滿的答案，現在問題重提，不惟是原封未動，而且愈顯着嚴重了！據說咱們是禮義之邦，所謂租界地的當局，又素講人道，爲什麽會弄到娼妓充斥，汉有辦法，成了日趨嚴重的問題？這是大堪研究的，爲研究問題的便利，先舉幾個事實來：</p>
<p>一，「···官兒的消遺，消受左擁右抱嬌妻艷妾，自然被限於一二等紅人的大官。在面京没有公娼，那班孤身漢，因此追逐私娼···其次是聽清唱，不用說是醉翁之意不在酒，靠近夫子廟的茶店，在五點鐘之後，充塞着掛徽章的政府各部院的小官僚，有時爲了捧角，而發生爭風吃醋的醜劇，···」</p>
<p>二，立法院審議刑法修正案，關於妨害風化罪之「强姦罪」，現行法原定姦淫未滿十六歲女子，以强姦論，修正案改爲十四歲，雖經激烈辯論，卒以二十九人對四十人，照「修正案」通過。</p>
<p>三，「旱災遍佈着江南，而溧陽更是赤地千里，可憐嗷嗷待哺的災黎，即不得不流離他鄕，所以有許多溧陽女子就跑到無錫來，爲了飢寒的交迫，她們也就顧不到廉恥地出賣皮肉，任有錢的男子去蹂躪，因此激動了藏汚淫窟的九成里的諸龜鴇的怒火，居然堂而皇之的於茶肆中大開其四桌會議，以謀對付溧陽的舶來妓女丨議决，一致驅逐溧陽女子出境···</p>
<p>四，一父母價賣未成年子女與人爲養子女，除妨害自由，或妨害風化，依各本條處斷外，不成立妨害家庭」（見院字第八八六號解釋丨關於刑法和誘略誘的）故父母價賣生女爲娼，雖經法院罰辦，仍可領回现賣！並不受法律制裁。</p>
<p>五，全國各都市均有「花捐」（即妓捐）之徵收，南京雖名禁娼，而所謂「清唱歌女」仍行徵捐的，至於如上海之租界，妓院更公開營業！自長三「（高等娼妓）似重雉妓（即最下娼妓丨通稱野鷄）都各有捐！</p>
<p>六，上海公共租界，此次雖大捕雉妓，然僅由捕房以「違警」起訴，罰欸每人最高額不過十五元，不能繳納，則改爲數自拘役，過後仍交龜鴇們領回。</p>
<p>七，販賣人口法條，已經廢除，法院凡遇人口買賣案件，槪以刑法第二百五十七條，第二百五十八條，第二百四十九條，第三百一十五條等罪刑處斷，然對於娼妓，除經拘捕，治以違警處罰外，全國法院之檢察官絕少以上列各條起訴根究者（按「營利略誘罪之成立，不必得有實利，且不須告訴，見七年上字第九八九號判例！）至於特區法院（在租界内的）之法官，受恊定束縛，據云檢察官且無權對於此點論告！</p>
<p>由上面所舉的事實，我們可以看出··</p>
<p>第一，縱慾無度，以蹂躪摧殘婦女來逞其獸性的，都是飽暖以上的有錢有勢的男子們！（如一例）旦一般人尙爲色情</p>
<p>狂者，作護符。（如二例）第二，婦女淪落流爲娼妓，多爲飢寒所迫，近年天災人禍，加緊農村破產，工商凋敝，致貧家婦女逼入娼妓一途的一天多一天。（如三例）第三，營淫業的人，被政府認爲正當職業，（如五例）刑法上雖有和誘略誘罪刑的條文，但法官們站在男子的利益上却並不引用。（如七例）而父母之價賣子女，在刑法上乃屬享有親權之正當行爲。（如四例）第四，租界上拘捕雉妓，只因其違犯警規，並非爲着禁娼，龜鴇們之經營淫營，乃爲華洋兩重官家所保護（見六七兩例）！</p>
<p>於是我們可以明白··</p>
<p>一，在男權社會裏面，蹂躪摧殘婦女以及經營淫業，不惟不算犯罪，實際還受政府法律保護的！</p>
<p>二，在現社會下，對於「娼妓」，不論是主廢，禁，或救，都是做不到的。</p>
<p>三，嫖娼狎妓的，都是有錢有勢的男子們，被蹂躪摧殘的却是被壓迫受剥削的貧窮婦女！在這種塲合，並没有所謂禮義廉恥，更無所謂人道，亦有獸慾，獸慾，獸慾！</p>
<p>由此可見娼妓之產生，是有其社會組織的根源的，所以要將這問題作根本的解决，必需把這個社會有所改革</p>
<h3>粵南的婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 郎瑛</p>
<p>粵南地方遼闊，現在我所指的僅是靠近南海之濱的台山縣，其他各縣大都是不同的，僅是這小小一縣的婦妇生活，也頗有値得告訴讀者的。</p>
<p>台山縣是一個富有的地方，文化也頗發達，但因經濟的支配不同，婦女的生活，亦有其天壤之别，她們有許多是過着很舒適的生活！有許多都在黑暗的封建勢力底下過着痛苦的歳月</p>
<p>台山一縣往南洋及美洲謀生的男人極多，可以說是佔了全縣男人三分之一。他們在外國一混便十年八年，甚至到老死的時候也不歸國的，所以，他們的妻子都在家里過着寂寞的生活。他們每年都匯寄了許多錢回來供給家庭的費用，所謂「金山客」，這些佔了全縣很大的權威，因爲他們都是靠着美金的高價而富有的。至于「南洋客」呢，則多是在外國做苦力的，錢很少，而且大多數是窮苦的大衆，所以，在出洋的兩種人中，眞是天堂地獄之分。不過這兩年來世界經濟的恐怖，不但南洋的工人被驅逐回國，而美國的華僑也遭同一的命運，失業紛紛，停止匯欵，台山縣頓成死縣，一切的都破壞不堪了。</p>
<p>以前，鄕俗中有；「有女嫁金山客」的念頭，每一個父母都紛紛要把女兒配金山客的，一是禮金高貴，二是人家富厚，有權威，做岳父母的也得沾光。三是女兒可以享福，不作勞苦工作，儘日清閑度日。「三姑六婆」之流，也以介紹「金山客」的妻妾爲榮。所以，美貌的少女，都走上這條路。但她們完全不顧慮到女兒的永遠幸福，因爲，凡去外國的人最少也是三數年才歸國一次的，甚至是一生也不歸國的。那麽，這可枉誤了女兒的靑春呵！</p>
<p>以前，我的一個表姊告訴我！她也是！金山客的妻子！她說做女人最好嫁給在家里做事的男人，因爲，丈夫一去外國，一個人活守寡，多麽枯燥啦。而且她是堅决地反對她的妹妹們再要嫁給金山客··</p>
<p>「你們看，像飛一樣白白的替他守空門已經三年啦；」</p>
<p>這是經騐告訴她們，所以，這幾年來，稍爲讀過幾年書而有反抗的勇氣者，都羣起爭取自由，不願意嫁給金山客的。她們曉得，錢是不能够安慰她們的靑春的，况且禮敎束縛底下，决不由她們有非法的念頭，倘如一經發覺和别男子通姦的話，遭受慘刑後還被驅逐，夫家不留，母家也不容足立。那麽，不是只不一條死路嗎？</p>
<p>至于一般勞苦大衆的家庭裏除了每日勞働以外，她們倒都能够享受性愛的幸福。雖然封建的家庭還束縛着她們，壓制她們，使她們没有滿足的生活，但，近年來，敎育漸漸的普迵遍，她們大多數從姊妹朋友中學到了反抗封建家庭的壓制·反以媳婦的權威壓制丈夫，家姑等是很多的。而且，這種反抗的勢力展開得很利害，她們大多數都有主婦的權威的。其他的生活上的種種，和各地只是大同小異而已。</p>
<p>富有的家庭的女兒和媳婦的生活，似乎特别該提出來說明的。所謂富有的人家除了一切地主（而這些也大多是華僑的。）大商家以外，便是往國外做工的華僑！金山客！家庭了。她們没有男人，而主持着家庭，小兒女是到學校讀書。媳婦呢，她們的丈夫一結了婚便離家了。她們孤獨地守着，一切勞動可以不大去幹。她們天天有空，和别人家談天。但現大入學校讀書的也是是不少的。當然，她們很少是拿着求學的目的，不外是消磨了整年的孤獨生活而已·</p>
<p>所以，台山各小學都有很多的少婦混在小孩們羣里讀書·就是中學校吧，她們也佔了不少的位置呢。然而，無論如何，她們是不能够解决性慾的，靑春時候的苦悶呀！爲了種種的緣故，發生夫貞，私奔，師生間發生了戀情等等的新聞。</p>

<p>每天推着空車往家裏走時心裏便打上個疙瘩，行市是永也漲不了，任牠五大枚一斤六大枚一斤，但一合洋價便少得不像話了，然而家裏是有六張空嘴在等着，老伍每天到米麵舗買本地麵時總像不敢多搭一句似的，深怕當秤的人一聲鼻哼··</p>
<p>「本來漲了行市的啦！」</p>
<p>老伍在心裏吟唸着··六七口人呢，全是帶着黃紙般的皮膚的呀！霍地便想起，這應該說是八口人的，因爲女人的肚子裏還藏着一個啦！</p>
<p>「八個半月，還多一點······」揪着女人的肚子，老伍在肚子裏計算着。再一看旁邊便是一條從七歲排起的人頭扶梯。</p>
<p>「眞他媽的兩年一個不差一釘點兒！」但他想到這是「孼由自造」時，便又苦着臉嘿嘿地樂了。不過祗有那兩個，腰板還能挺得很直的老爹娘，是使老伍没法不承認自已這份子「福氣」··不是誰問起了時都會讚嘆一聲··「老伍··您好大的福氣！爹娘雙全！」</p>
<p>女人是個能吃苦的，當第四個孩子快要降生時，她還是在白菜畦裏忙着揀蟲子上糞，心裏祗計算着「該匀出點地來弄油菜了」，對於這多睜眼的小四滿不在心。老伍却老爲這個花着心計，覺得第四個孩子是留不得的，當女人有點不願意這計劃時，老伍便陰着嗓子··</p>
<p>「白菜喂不飽這一羣呀！」女人看一看身邊的人頭扶梯······便也接不下話頭去，肚子裏嚥着苦水。</p>
<p>預先幾天，老伍便在行商時留着神，打聽人家可有誰家要抱孩子，這惹的販鷄蛋賣燒餅的同伴們都樂了··</p>
<p>「頂好俺也把自已那個四威的送人哪」</p>
<p>！</p>
<p>「媽媽的，兩年一個！俺也没這麽大的興頭！」那塌鼻樑的又要起來了··「老伍你是自作自受𡀂！」�</p>
<p>老伍伸着紫紅的手把菜車推走幾步，躱開了這些嘲笑，在這時候，他没有心緒和人家鬥樂兒，藏着一堆愁苦。</p>
<p>孩子終於没半點遲延的又來了，祗是瘦癟一點，小手兒像鷄爪子似的。見到是個小子，老伍放心一點，這會給他不少便利。</p>
<p>第二天天才黎明時，他把孩子裝在白菜車面上，用藍布遮着，孩子很乖，竟不動聲息地躺在那裏，隨着車前行着。當老伍夾着苦涩澀的音調招呼同伴們揭開藍布時，孩子的小眼微歙着。</p>
<p>「有人要麽？」老伍那麽低聲問着。接着又是··「有人要麽」？······</p>
<h3>法與我們</h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>中國的老古調兒，有所謂『有治人，無治法』；而近今的時賢，則又主對人無問題，對法須斟酌。這主法治的精神，算是一大進步了。隨着這進步，男女平權也便成了定讞。試翻開現行法律和大清法律來比較，婦女地位的增高，不要說鄕愚要嘡目昨呑，就連時賢也要驚嘆。</p>
<p>現行法律中有許多女權的規定，簡直是在西歐的先進國家之上，這眞値得我們感謝。不過感謝是感謝將來，感謝將來這法令完全實現的一天。若論現在，許多不良的事實，點汚了法律的尊嚴。譬如禁止人口買賣，現行刑法本有明文規定··然偏有不肖的窮苦之徒，甘冒不諱，拿自已的妻女出賣。隨處的婢妾娼妓，無用說都是買賣而來。這還說是平常小户··若至前些時哄動平津的張故元帥作霖之女鮑張氏虐待使女致死一案，則又知禮守法的貴胄之家，亦復有如此行爲。可知出賣妻女的不肖之徒太多，好人家不買又將奈何？此等時節，法律的本身，也祗好飲恨呑聲了。</p>
<p>近日立法院正在將法律修改。關於風化方面，修正草案，本已加入處罰有婦之夫與人通姦的一條，但昨日開會，已被多數委員反對而删去。又現行刑法，規定姦淫未滿十六歲之女子者以强姦論，而修正案則减爲十四歲；幾經委員諸公熱烈的辯論，終於通過成立。今後有婦之夫，姦淫十四歲以上尙無丈夫的小姑娘，當可别無問題··這當又歸於婦女年的碩果了。</p>
<p>數年來大都市裏頽廢的生活，刺激到少女們的性的知識，成者有早熟的可能。可是大多數被姦淫的少女，如雛妓，童工，婢女之類，都由質樸貧苦的鄕村而來··十六歲以下的她們，那裏談得上發育？然而時運製造了城中有那許多急色的哥兒，勢必需要她們發育上有長足的進步··如果今後十四歲以上的姑娘，而有因被姦而殘病死亡，那卻是命裏注定了的。</p>
<p>自量！一切唯有量自已的力。男女平等的原則已行之二十年，女子没有組織，没有奮鬥的能力，到現在光景還是這樣！法律有如浮在天空的太陽，縱有普照的光明，也要你在地上站得住一角地位，不是被踏在他人的脚下，然後才拜見得到。所以縱令有絕對男女平權的法律，婦女的解放豈竟說可能？而况今日的法律，還是這個光景呢？</p>

<h3>眞理</h3>
<p>— 雉明</p>
<p>太陽，地球，水，整個字宙，整個自然界，都是具體地客觀地存在着的，這是誰也没有辦法否認的眞理。人類的思想乃客觀事物之反映，要客觀事物有其眞實存在性，我們才能認識眞理，因而在我們的意識中才有眞理存在。人類的意識中的主觀的眞理，是客觀眞理之反映，但客觀眞理却是獨立於我們的觀念之外而眞實存在的。一般玄學家之否認客觀事物的眞實存在性，否認客觀眞理，以爲眞理完全是人類主觀的產物，以爲客觀事物是依存於人類的觀念的，這完全是信仰主義的表現。若依此，則人類的觀念又是從何而來的呢？在人類没有出現以前就眞實存在的客觀事物又是依存於什麽的呢？這恐怕只有依據「上帝創造萬物」的原理來回答問題了，眞是神秘之至！</p>
<p>烏利亞洛夫說：「······對於客觀眞理的否認，是不可知論，又是主觀主義」</p>
<p>，這種否認客觀眞理的荒謬，我們考慮下述自然科學史的眞理實例，已可顯見了。自然科學確言地球早存在於人類未出現惟前，這一眞理不容有絲毫疑慮的餘地。照物質論的認識論觀點看來，被表象者獨立於表象之外而存在（外界對於意識的獨立）這一主張是很和科學眞理相一致的，實際上，外在世界獨立於人類意識這一原理，是物質論的根本命題。地球在人類未出現以前早已存在着，這笙科學的確說是個客觀的眞理。這種立塲和馬哈派哲學及其對於眞理的學說是不相兩立的。因爲，如果眞理是人類經騐的一種組織形態，則對於地球於没有人類經騐以前早已存在的任何主張，不能算是眞理了。」一般經騐批判論者之謂「眞理是人類經騐的一種組織形態」，也和神學家觀念論者之謂眞理爲上帝所命定或爲人類主觀的產物一樣，都是否認客觀眞理的存在，都是玄妙的不合理的說法，所不同者，只是在於他們所用的名詞有别而已。</p>
<p>眞理旣是客觀地存在着的，當然就有其絕對性。無論自然界或人類社會，在一定的時間和空間中，都必然有事物的一種存在形式，這存在形式並非抽象地出於幻想，而是具體地客觀地存在着的，因而便是無容否認的絕對眞理。爬蟲類雖然只是在地球的全部歷史中的一定時間内才有其存在，但謂地球成立後有一個時期有爬蟲類動物存在，這總是不能爭論的眞理。一九三四年奥大利總理杜爾夫斯在維也納被刺身死了，這雖然並非一件了不起的事，但在人類的歷史過程中有這一件事出現，確是不能否認的事實丨丨丨眞理。所以，我們說在事物之客觀地絕對地存在的意義上，眞理是有其絕對性的。如果否認眞理的絕對性了，其結果便只有走入神學世界之一途丨</p>
<p>但是，一切事物都在不住運動，不住變化中，事物的絕對存在是有時空的限制的，因而眞理的絕對性也非受時空的限制不可丨丨超時空的絕對眞是不</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>會有的。說在地球的歷史中某一時期内有爬蟲類動物存在，固是絕對眞理，但若說無論在什麽時期内都有這東西存在，那便大錯而特錯了。地球存在於宇宙存在的某一時期中，於此時期之外就没有其存在，因之若謂在宇宙存在的某一時期内有地球，固是絕對眞理，但若說在宇宙存在的任何時期内都有地球，那眞理便成爲謬誤了。在人顃社會中，眞理不但要受時空的限制，而且在生活不同的人羣中也有不同的眞理。很顯然的，基督敎的禁欲主義在中世紀是被當作眞理而受人們擁護的，但在目前誰還承認這是眞理呢？殺人的事情在現代的我們看來當然是不對的，但被襲於定期的饑餓的緑島的愛斯基摩人却有殺病人和老人的習慣，且以爲這是善事。丨丨丨這樣看來，和眞理之有絕對性一樣，眞理又是有相對性的。因爲事物是眞實存在的，所以眞理有絕對性；又因爲事物是在不斷變化中，其存在要受時空的限制，所以眞理又有相對性。由是，眞理便是絕對的又是相對的了。</p>
<p>因爲事物是確實存在的，又是不斷變化着的，這「確實存在」與「不斷變化」都是事物的本質，所以依存於此的絕對眞理和相對眞理並非絕對對立着的。没有絕對眞理，便没有相對實理，相對眞理乃絕對眞理之積累的產物；反之，没有相對眞理，便不會有絕對眞理，絕對眞理是相對眞理形成的。所以，絕對眞理與相對眞理又是矛盾的，又是統一的，有其矛盾的統一性，亦有其統一的矛盾性。</p>
<p>總之，眞理是具體的。無論客觀眞理與主觀眞理，無論絕對眞理和相對眞理，都有具體地存在着的事物爲依據，都非抽象的幻想。太陽與地球，封建社會與基督敎，拿破崙與杜爾夫斯，在宇宙，人類的歷史過程中確有其存在，所以我們才能說這存在是眞理，否則便是錯誤。這是丨丨我們對眞理的解說。</p>

<h3>體力與事業</h3>
<p>— 尹馨</p>
<p>丨丨兩個有興味的統計丨丨</p>
<p>能負荷大事的人必先有濔滿的精神。否則，機會之來，終因自已的精神萎靡頽敗，不能應付非常的時機。如俾士麥，當締結和約的時候，有人說他：「俾士麥服軍裝狀貌魁梧，若和他對立談話，則見一皤然白髮，老態婆娑的老翁。故觀於儀容的强弱，勝敗之數已定了。」</p>
<p>西諺有云：「健全的精神，寓於健全的身體。」軀幹雄偉的，他的精力也必彌覺充滿。美國曾有人因爲研究「軀幹和人身的關係」，曾就國中各界領袖，調查其身高及體重，作成兩個極有興趣的統計：</p>
<p>四十種領袖的身高如下：</p>
<p>類别　平均高度</p>
<p>（以英尺寸</p>
<p>計算其小數　　點則表明每　　寸之幾）</p>
<p>改革家　五、一一、四</p>

<p>警察長　五、一一、一</p>
<p>社會黨組織者五、一○、九</p>
<p>鐵路總理　五、一○、九大學校長　五、一○、八</p>

<p>市立學校監督五、一○、四</p>
<p>工團團長　五、一○、四</p>
<p>敎會會長　五、一○、四</p>
<p>公司總理　五、一○、四</p>
<p>禁酒家　五、一○、三</p>
<p>靑年會幹事　五、一○、三</p>
<p>世界工黨　五、一○、三</p>
<p>發明者　五、一○、二</p>
<p>著作家　五、一○、二</p>
<p>售貨經理　五、一○、一</p>
<p>藝術家　五、一○、一</p>
<p>市長　五、一○、○</p>
<p>工廠監督　五、九、八</p>
<p>保險經理　五、九、七</p>
<p>心理學家　五、九、七</p>
<p>慈善會會長　五、九、六</p>
<p>法院院長　五、九、六</p>
<p>哲學家　五、九、六</p>
<p>商人　五、九、四</p>
<p>車頭房監督　五、九、三</p>
<p>禁酒會職員　五、九、二</p>
<p>講師　五、九、二</p>
<p>製造家　五、九、○</p>
<p>工黨之組織者　五、八、二</p>
<p>出版家　五、七、九</p>
<p>音樂家　五、五、六</p>
<p>從這統計中，我們可以無疑地看出兩點：一，各界領袖，大多是軀幹高大的。其中以行政首領爲尤甚；二，大凡如藝術家，發明家，著作家等，智力優越的，則軀幹不如行政領袖高大。</p>
<p>又，四十種領袖的體重，統計如下：</p>
<p>類别　平均重量</p>
<p>（以磅爲單位）</p>
<p>清道監督　二一六、七</p>
<p>警察長　二○二、四</p>
<p>看守長　一九一、二</p>
<p>慈善會會長　一九○、四</p>
<p>救火會會長　一八九、四</p>
<p>靑年會幹事　一八八、六</p>
<p>銀行行長　一八六、八</p>
<p>工廠監督　一八六、七</p>
<p>工團團長　一八六、三</p>
<p>工黨之組織者　一八六、一</p>
<p>參議員　一八五、○</p>
<p>禁酒家　一八四、九</p>
<p>售貨經理　一八二、八</p>
<p>世界工黨　一八二、二</p>
<p>省長　一八二、○</p>
<p>改革家　一八一、七</p>
<p>大學校長　一八一、六</p>
<p>公司經理　一七九、八</p>
<p>市立學校監督　一七八、六</p>
<p>車頭房監督　一七七、○</p>
<p>市長　一七六、九</p>
<p>主敎　一七六、四</p>
<p>禁酒會職員　一七六、三</p>
<p>保險經理　一七五、二</p>
<p>出版家　一七一、九</p>
<p>律師公會會長　一七一、五</p>
<p>社會黨之組織　一七一、○</p>
<p>者</p>
<p>經濟社會學家　一七○、八</p>
<p>敎會會長　一六九、八</p>
<p>發明家　一六九、四</p>
<p>法院院長　一六九、○</p>
<p>藝術家　一六五、七</p>
<p>商人　一六三、七</p>
<p>講師　一六二、三</p>
<p>音樂家　一六一、九</p>
<p>哲學家　一五八、四</p>
<p>著作家　一五八、四</p>
<p>心理學家　一五五、三</p>
<p>從上表中看來，各界領袖的體重，都可說在常人的水平綫上。又行政領袖常較智力領袖爲重，這也是因各適於其職務的緣故。</p>
<p>人的體重與身高，不一定與事業的成就成正比例。譬如法院院長平均身高五尺九寸又六，較之看守長平均身高五尺十一寸又三，相差一寸有奇。看守長誠雄偉矣，難道法院院長就不如看守長嗎？又如心理學者，著作家，哲學家等，體重居最低地位，但如達爾文，斯賓塞，舉世導師，萬流宗仰，而體力未必最碩偉的。</p>
<p>話雖如此說，但人的體重與身高者，實較適宜於謀事業的成就的。</p>
<p>身體的輕重高低，受之天禀，亦有賴於後天的鍜鍊。身材短小者，也未嘗不可訓練成精悍的人。拿破崙是短小而精悍的人，故不失爲一代怪傑。</p>
<p>— 訓練與修養</p>
<h3>從楊墨的思想説到青年的修養</h3>
<p>— 熊石</p>
<p>孟子最反對的是楊朱和墨翟，但我勸人最好能爲墨，若不能，求其次，須爲楊。現在我且把楊朱和墨家的思想研究一下，就可以證明孟子偏見批評的不當。</p>
<p>（一）楊朱的消極思想</p>
<p>第一，楊朱主張「不損人不利已」。孟子枰擊楊朱，是斷章取義的捉了「拔一毛而利天下不爲也」這一句話。其實楊朱篇中明明在「拔一毛而利天下不爲也」一句下面，跟着一句「集天下於一身不取也」。楊朱與伊尹的「一介之微不以與人，一介之微不以取人」之說不謀而合。然孟子是重伊尹而輕楊朱的。</p>
<p>「不損人，不利已」，這雖是一種消極的思想，但觀乎世人因欲達利已的目的，於是不能不損人，世間多數損人的行爲，無非都由於「利已」，天下因此就多事了。</p>
<p>第二，楊朱反「名」。「名」與「實」，實在是兩件事，享受虚名的並不一定有「實」，有「實」的並不一定卽爲有「名」的，故楊朱說：「名無實，實無名。」</p>
<p>社會上常常可以見到某一件事請「名人」列名，請「名人」題簽，社會上一般人上「名人」的「名」的當，而蒙無窮的害的，不一而足。故論語孔子解釋「名人」爲「攝名而行違」，名人所能爲之事，卽在表面文章博取虚名。</p>
<p>平心思之，今日社會中的每個分子，若均能不務虚名，面幹實在工作，則天下何至混亂至此？</p>
<p>（二）墨家的積極思想</p>
<p>墨家的思想，有一部墨了，但文義奥僻，至今尙有未能一一解釋者。綜其精湛，可分爲三部分：（一）兼愛，非攻，守備；（二）節儉；（三）紀律生活。</p>
<p>第一，兼愛，非攻和守備。</p>
<p>（甲）墨子的兼愛，孟子卽以此爲罪墨的口實。孟子以爲墨子「老吾老以及人之老」，以自已的父親無異别人的父親，「是無父也」，其實這種批評是極寃枉的。要知人世間一切罪惡都起源於「分别心」，因爲有「人」「我」的觀念，一切罪惡才因此而起。凡一事有利害衝突，非犧牲他人而利已，卽犧牲自已以利他，若不能去除「人」「我」的「分别心」，則賊他人之家以利自已的家，破壞他人的國家以利自已的國家，天下一切禍源便永無滅絕之日了。</p>
<p>（乙）墨子主張非攻。處戰國羣雄爭覇戰爭混亂的狀態之下，殺人盈城，殺人盈野，滿目瘡痍，悽絕人寰。但一般人的觀念，以爲一已殺人固爲罪惡，爲國家去殺人反爲功績。打個譬喩，一段粉筆，吾人認爲白色，若一匣粉筆，我人卽認爲黑色，不是錯誤得太可笑嗎？殺一人者固黨判罪，殺百人者更當判罪。這是墨子在論理上主張「非攻」。</p>
<p>（丙）守備。當戰國時宋國向守亦主張弭兵之說，所謂弭兵，正合現在國際聯盟，海牙國際法庭等等一樣，只從道德的立塲上去勸人息爭，可是終無辦法。墨子看破這點，主張必有後盾（卽有守備）然後才能談得到非攻。當時公輸般造飛鳶雲梯助楚攻宋，墨子由魯奔走十日十夜至楚，與公輸般論攻守的技術，楚才停了攻宋的計畫。故曰：非攻心須能守，這是墨子在技術上去反對戰爭。</p>
<p>第二，墨子主張節儉</p>
<p>（甲）節用　世上儘管有「吃不下」的人，但又充滿了「没得吃」的人。墨子主張節用。他的標準「以奉給民用卽止」，卽生活最低標準所必需者爲限度。若吃得太多和過分，卽在自已的一份食物之外，搶了别人的食物，「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨」卽是此等寫照。故墨子要人把不急之務廢止，享用過甚者應節用。</p>
<p>（乙）節葬　在古時常將珍物殉人之葬，將可以供作生產之財貨，埋之於地，甚至因此惹起翻屍倒棺的禍患，實極無意識的舉動。因這種奢侈的習</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>尙，所以貧窮的只好幾代的祖宗暴露着不葬。墨子就極力反對舗張，眩耀闊綽，說「棺三寸足以朽體，衣衾三領足以覆惡」，這是墨家的節葬主張。</p>
<p>（丙）廢樂　本來陶情治性，莫善於樂，但墨子爲什麽廢樂呢？墨子生當亂世，戰國時的「樂」，也必與現在所習聞的靡靡之音相類似吧！我們每天清晨，走上街道，商店中的收音機就在「好寳寳，要睡覺」。試問這種頽廢沉迷的音樂，對於身心究竟有什麽益處呢？</p>
<p>第三，紀律生活</p>
<p>墨家的精神，就在紀律嚴肅這一點。墨家的宗敎領袖呌做鉅子，有無上的權威。有鉅子「復　」者僅一子，犯殺人罪，宋君曰：汝子殺人當死，但念你只一子，已飭大赦了。胆鉅子說：雖蒙王赦，但墨家「殺人者死」爲鐵的紀律，非死，則將有不行之法，遂殺子。又，羊城君有友爲鉅子某，給符令守城。羊城君出征，不料羊城爲楚圍，鉅子某唯死守羊城，子弟勸之曰：白犧牲性命，將斷墨家之續，而對羊城亦無益，曷若棄城而走？但鉅子某謂：羊城君以重任予我，若我棄城而走，從此人皆以爲墨家中無忠節之士，可託之人，以後人將不必在墨家中求，這無異自絕墨家生命也，於是鉅子及衆弟子俱殉羊城。這種「赴湯蹈火，决不旋踵」的精神，决不是空口「訓練」所可成就，只有自已的精神表現，以自苦爲極，方能有後來繼續的子弟。</p>
<p>（三）結語</p>
<p>墨子是以積極的精神，以自苦爲極，來救人救世，實足爲吾人法則。但若不能做到；則楊朱消極的不損人不利已，不務虚名，而重實際，也已救已而有餘。望有爲的靑年愼檡之。</p>

<p>生活</p>
<h3>塌車夫</h3>
<p>— 長發</p>
<p>我們常時在輪船碼頭，火車站和工廠的附近，看見一種笨而且重的巨型的車子，上面層樓疊屋地裝上了各種各樣的貨物，由着好幾個外表健壯而實不甚健康的人推推拉拉地把牠不知運到什麽地方去。這種車子呌做「塌車」，推推拉拉的那種人自然就是「塌車夫」了。</p>
<p>這種塌車的構造是異常簡單的：兩個笨重的鐵輪子夾着一根極堅實的輪軸，上面覆以一種長丈餘頗爲笨厚的木車床，車床兩邊緊靠着輪子的地方有兩根長而粗的車柱，車床下面則有可放零星雜物的無蓋的小櫃。車柱的構造比較巧妙，牠分爲兩節，在不需要的時候可以把犣拆下；在貨物多，佔地位大時可以再裝上去，以便多載貨物。</p>
<p>塌車夫使用塌車的方法是前面的人拉，後面的人推。拉的人多少没有一定，多半要視貨物的輕重而來决定需要人數的多寡。但普通不能少過三個人（就是空車子也要兩個人拉），因爲用塌車夫運載的貨物决不是分量少而又輕的，非有相當人力，你不能動牠一毫一髮。用四五個人拉很普通；用二三十人拉的也有，但這是比較少見罷了。</p>
<p>推的人就像是船上掌舵的人，雖然也要用很大的氣力，但人多了反礙手礙脚，不甚方便，通常用一個人到兩個人就够了。塌車本來是着重拉的（這一點和「老虎車」差不多），這也就是牠和普通的手車，小車······不同的地方。</p>
<p>塌車夫出了大氣力把貨物送到老遠老遠的堆棧裏，作塲裏，工房裏，店舗裏······流着黑汗，呼吸着都市的烟煤氣，喘吁吁地前行着······這並算不得是他們生活中最辛苦的一頁，這甚至於是給他們一個閒談休息的機會。他們在這種時候可以瀏覽馬路上的景緻，還可以相互談談閒話。</p>
<p>最磨折他們，需要他們拿出最大的力量來應付的是裝卸貨物的這件事。裝貨火車和輪船貨艙裏時常有一些笨重無比怪形怪樣的貨物，當火車或輪船到埠的時候，就頑强地要求着他們拿出巨量的勞力來對付。碼頭上自然也還另有一批搬卸貨物的碼頭工人，但塌車行的老板（這種人大半與交通機關有關係）在有錢可賺時也是要吩咐他的手下人從事艱苦的勞動的。至於客人來「提貨」，則裝貨上車的勞苦工作毫無疑問地是落到他們的身上來了。貨棧裏那貨的山高聳着：「山積」的貨他們得一包一包地，一簍一簍地，一箱一箱地，一捆一捆地，一袋一袋地，一條一條地，一件一件地，搬上他們的塌車（有許多貨是用運貨汽車運送的）：那三四百斤的重載毫不留情地壓在他們背上，壓得他們不得不從氣管中哼出一些「哼呵哈，哈呵哈」的簡單歌詞來，冀以减少他們背上這種難於忍受的壓力。有些不能重摜的貨物，如玻璃，磁器，藥品，和一些其他箱裝的貨物，是不能立刻丢下的，需要他們停住忍受若干時：在這種塲合他們也就只得咬着牙齒等待别的同伴來解救他們了。蠶豆大的汗珠子從他們的臉上落下來。一種無邊的疲乏和痛苦的雲霧籠罩上了他們的全身。用袖口揩去額上的汗點，吐一口氣，他們可又得從新去從事那些未完的工作！</p>
<p>他們這種工作大都是有害衛生的。這並不是我爲了他們的背上負重三四百斤而替他們担心，而是這種工作在本質上有礙健康。任何種貨物，特别是紛類如麵粉，香末之類，你只須稍一搬動，立刻會有粉的霧圍繞在你的周圍，而且立刻擴散傳播在全貨房裏：任何在貨房裏工作的人都呼吸着這粉的霧，都從口腔裏吐出一種不白不黃不黑，也白也黃也黑的濃痰來，面上身上也疲這粉的霧掩没得糢糊莫辨，找不到那裏是眼睛，那裏是鼻子，也看不出你穿的衣服是白的抑是黑的了。此外可以重摜的貨物，如一袋裝的瓜子，花生，黃豆，緑豆，芝蔴，小麥，和一些布類，洋紗，絨綫，羊毛，···之類，則每一着地，也不可避免地有灰塵的霧乘機飛塲，環繞包圍着那些工作的人們。好在他們是些不懂而且不講衛生的小工們，是全不在乎這些的。</p>
<p>他們這樣辛勞的工作着，所得的報酬却亦非常有限。通常替客家搬運貨物，大抵是按件計算的多。貨物重些的，路遠些的，要的代價自然是要多些。普通送里把路二三百斤的貨物大致每件從二角到三角。路遠而又重的，五角七角一件的也有。也有包送的，價籤自然没有一定。講價時塌車夫是不能置一辭的，他們是受僱於老板，一切對外的事自有老扳負責。他們出力，從老板　裏取得工錢。工錢多少没有一定，視每天老板作的生意多寡而定。老板把從客家得來的錢對半拆分給他們是很不錯的了，通常是四六或三七分的多，甚至有二八分的。不久前我在天津大公報上看到天津有一個替麵粉廠運貨的塌車老板，就因爲二八分賬爲塌車夫所不滿以致發生了毆打傷人的風潮。實際上，塌車夫每月平均多亦不過賺到十多塊錢，火食還是自吃自的。</p>
<p>他們有時也有些額外收入。客家有時要在貨棧裏將貨物「過秤」，他們替客家稱一件可得到五分到一角錢。這錢自然也是要和老板分的。有時有些可以吃食的貨物，如分瓜子花生之類，偶然遺落了一點，他們可以半公開或秘密地掃起來拿回家去。貨棧裏規矩很嚴，偸竊的事雖也問或有之，但一查到馬上是要被開革的，所以收於嘗試的人也不很多。</p>

<h3>齒部衛生談</h3>
<p>— 黃炳基</p>
<p>齒之衛生學係論齒及口中各部纖維之康健，亦卽使身上各機體能工作如常，營養如恒之謂也。夫不潔之口，乃危害人身康健之唯一原因，蓋空氣中千萬微生物皆從口中呼出而成肺癆，肺炎，喉痧，喉核炎，喉管炎及傷風等重症，故不潔之口皀疾病之口，人有康健之口，决無疾病，反言之，疾病之人决無康健之口也。</p>
<p>一國及國民之文明程度，可以牙刷之銷路推測之，故著名黑人學者「華盛頓」嘗言：『牙刷爲增進文明最大之功具也。』彼曾鼓勵學生養成齒潔之習慣，使之自愛而增進文明，意誠遠哉丨蓋清潔之齒永不腐爛，不潔之口足使齒朽，進而髓質暴露，疼痛異常；若再不愼，則齒槽膿腫，非特痛苦難堪，且將成爲急性血毒症而死，寗不可畏？牙肉之浮腫，亦因流液之結成牙垢及食物碎屑之累積而成，以致牙根之薄膜漸漸發炎，濃汁繼之而出，結果，齒乃脫落。他若口炎，咽喉炎，喉核炎，以及一切疾病，皆從口中不潔而生也。</p>
<p>作者邇來曾檢查海上學校諸生，其患齒病之數，於三千三百六十八男女孩童中，祗百分之廿三生有健全之齒，百分之七十齒均腐朽，此種事實，能不令人驚駭？據美國海陸軍募兵處報告，有無數良好軍人，因牙齒之瑕疵而不能服務；在一九一七年投考陸軍中之百分之十九，亦失敗於齒之不健。當余在芝加哥六年實習期内，見該處之中國兒童及成丁者亦患同樣之病，年老之人百分之九十皆患各種齒槽膿腫之病，間有病勢頗重，齒骨漸斷而脫落，皆以無識之故而自入地獄，惟有靑年學生對於齒部頗爲留愼而已。</p>
<p>嬰兒生後至血牙出齊時之口部衛生，頗爲重要，其死於餵養不當者，較任何原因爲多，故液腺及牙齒未生之前，其食物除乳之外都不適宜也。當嬰兒初進食物時，其口部之清潔，爲母及乳母者務須格外留意。其法以藥水棉花一方包於洗凈之右手大拇指上，浸於硼砂酸中，取出而放入口中，移過舌之上面，而尤須在舌之下部及牙肉與牙齒之間整刷之，候齒齊出後，每日應以軟刷擦牙三四次。若遇病孩，其口更須注意，蓋無數微生物將於此時滋生，而釀成大禍也。</p>
<p>永久之齒約於六歲至十一歲左右逐漸而生成，蓋此時血牙受牙根之收縮而漸脫落。小孩在三歲至六歲間，須避過度之刺激物品或不周之營養，蓋値永久之齒在發達時期，小孩之精力减少，而神經系之疾病易於叢生，其小兒因口病齒朽及殘疾等之刺激而變成劣性者，比比皆是，可不愼哉！以心理學觀之，不齊之齒，歪形之顎，以及缺嘴等，足使活潑小兒失其快樂，由同伴之譏笑而將可愛之性情一變而爲兇暴殘忍矣。</p>
<p>由此觀之，口之衛生實爲重要。清潔之法，當備良好牙刷一柄，絲絨一塊，括舌器一個，及清水等，刷牙之時須上下内外兼顧，惟絲絨用惟移去食物之碎屑，而牙簽或亦可用，但不可損害牙肉之纖維而已。</p>
<p>小兒應敎以用鼻呼吸之法，蓋不正當之呼吸易生喉病，喉核炎，傷風，喉管炎及肺癆等疾病，而咀嚼器具之不健，尤足使所食之物難以消化，胃腸等病因之而生焉。</p>
<p>吾人須知良好之血液皆由良好之食物而來，然須經正當之咀嚼，消化，融化及酸化等程序。無健全之齒，不能作適當之咀嚼；無適當之咀嚼，食物卽不易消化；無新鮮之空氣，則食物難與養氣化合。故康健者，增進快樂之途徑：世人苟能得康健之道，實勝於登極樂之天堂也。</p>

<p>開篇「長相思」</p>
<p>秋雲淡薄菊花香。丹桂枝殘滿地黃。爲道常山風景好。西河柳掩映那茜紗窗。只見那山慈姑娘慵倚木香榻。終朝凝想花繽郎。思往事。暗心傷。曾記得去年半夏近端陽。相逢驀地在牡丹旁。荷花池畔言甜密。琥珀杯常滿鬱金香。玫瑰花下把想思訴。實指望白頭翁百歲永成雙。不料君冲宵遠志不尋常。投入川軍竟赴戰塲。到而今沉香殒殞玉喪性命。害得奴終身漂泊浮萍似。紅花抛盡懶梳妝。聽門外續斷杜鵑啼不住。芭蕉夜雨最心傷。那堪獨活更凄凉。</p>

<p>無綫電新聞</p>
<p>祗有話劇，在現中國無綫電中佔有了含有敎育的成份，也可以說，它證明了整個的無綫電節目中，不全是有閑文學底的麻醉性，在這兒，我先來介紹一下這一個話劇團體里的人物看：要介紹的是觀音劇社，此劇社里的人物，當我們合攏了眼睛也會憧憬底地捉摸着他們在舞台上的形態的，陳大悲，他努力劇戲劇運動是從民元前時代的春砌社始，胖胖底身材，和靄可親的舉止，雖然他已老了一點，但他還那麽地精神，繼續努力着他這理想中的事業戲劇。倉隱秋，她是觀音社里有歷史了的人，播演話劇的經騐，她確實已有了非常的把握，雖說她僅是一個經騐底電影的從業員，但，她扮演傻大姐一流的人物，的確是有着天賦的意識形態。</p>
<p>顧文宗，我們是老朋友了，他從小的時候就演着兒童劇，他的戲劇常識是跟着他的年齡在增加着，如令，我們已時常在銀幕里看得見他的成績了，他是一個矮矮的小胖子。</p>
<p>劉一了，他本來不是預備來到播音機前顯下身手的，他也没有準備過上銀幕里去出一下鋒頭的，他就是盡他可能作的事情作，舞台上的印像，使我永遠地泯滅不了，文章的烈性，使我再翻開來看仍興盦，可是，他不幸得很，曾經住過了兩個月的公安局大飯店。</p>
<p>靜雅，這位姑娘是値得人去敬愛一下的，純處女的尊嚴，是會使人感覺到一種神秘的想像，同時她的生活也很嚴肅的，除了在播音室里爲敎育大衆服務着，另一個時間里，另一個所在中，他是幹着另一有意義的工作。</p>
<p>本埠元昌電台，自播送李昌鑑聞聲戲以來，深得聽衆歡迎，故於晚間一時至二時曾添加李昌鑑講故事節目，茲因天氣漸冷，晚間節目暫行停止，惟以聽衆要求，日有百數十起，爲特訂於今日起，每晚一時至二時先行播送聞聲戲三天，并有該台主任張悌君担任配音，該台周率一一二○云。</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Arrives in Beiping Yesterday, Will Visit Chiang and Stay a Few Days Before Heading South</h3>
<p>Chiang Continues to Undergo Physical Examination at Xiehe Hospital</p>
<p>Director of the Five Departments of Hebei Province Arrives in Beiping, Receives Instructions and Returns to Tianjin</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Chonghui arrived in Beiping from Shanghai this morning. Chiang Kai-shek and Huang Fu's representative, He Qigong, representatives from the Political Readjustment Committee, Zhang Jianchu, Yuan Liang, Wang Shuchang, and over a hundred others welcomed him at the station. After alighting from the train, Wang proceeded to the Beijing Hotel. According to him, it has been seven years since he left Beiping. This visit is to see old friends and to discuss his journey south with Chiang Kai-shek. He will stay for a few days before heading south. Whether he will go to Hong Kong and Guangdong again is yet to be decided. The Southwest shares the same fervent desire for unity as the central government. His trips back and forth are purely in a private capacity, conveying the opinions of both sides. The specific methods will be decided by the authorities. While in Hong Kong, he met with Hu Hanmin. Chiang Kai-shek is currently in the hospital for a physical examination, and when he will visit him is yet to be decided. When the British Manchurian Industrial Survey Group set out, they issued a declaration stating that the mission was limited to business surveys and would not involve political activities. As for their recent actions, he has not paid attention due to his travels. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Chonghui passed through Tianjin on the through train from Shanghai to Beiping at around 6:00 AM on the 27th without disembarking. Yu Xuezhong's representative, Cha Yao, Wang Tao's representative, Zheng Shifen, the presidents of the two high courts in Tianjin, the police chief, and over ten reporters welcomed him at the station. Mr. Wang, wearing a blue silk robe, was amiable and composed. According to Wang, although the central government has expressed its desire multiple times, he is returning home on vacation and should return to The Hague within the year. This trip to Beiping is only intended for a three-day stay before returning south. When reporters inquired about Mr. Wang's views on North China and overall diplomacy, Mr. Wang replied that North China can temporarily achieve stability now. Although the situation between Japan and Russia was tense, the issue of the sale of the China Eastern Railway is gradually being resolved, and conflict is unlikely to occur recently. As for national diplomacy, he believes that the only way out is to "seek it within ourselves." First, national strength should be strengthened, and second, there should be active diplomacy, with international promotion also being indispensable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Chairman Chiang moved into Xiehe Hospital last night, he continued his physical examination this morning. Director of the Five Departments of Hebei Province was summoned to Beiping by Chiang Kai-shek via telegram to receive instructions yesterday and paid his respects yesterday afternoon. Wei Jian, Shi Jinghuan, and Lin Zongchengxiu returned to Tianjin last night. Zhou Binglin and Lu Muyuan returned to Tianjin on the same train this morning. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The entire committee of the Military Sub-Committee, including Wan Shansong and others, is scheduled to host a public banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek on the evening of the 28th, with Yang Yongtai and Huang Fu invited to accompany them. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The joint expanded commemorative week of the Beiping municipal party and government agencies, scheduled for next Monday, was originally intended to have Chiang Kai-shek attend and give instructions. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek has decided to send Secretary-General Yang Yongtai to attend on his behalf as he is undergoing a physical examination. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Soong May-ling is going to Yenching University today to attend a tea party to welcome graduating students from Wellesley College. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng Arrive in Beiping to Report on Political Affairs</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng, to report on the administrative and diplomatic situation of the Luan-Yu-Ji-Mi area, went to Beiping together at 9:00 AM this morning. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng arrived in Beiping on the same train this morning. Tao said that the situation after the opening of the Hebei Administrative Conference was excellent and that it could be closed the day after tomorrow. Today, each group is holding a review meeting and will return to Tianjin tomorrow night to continue attending the conference. Yin said that the matter of receiving the Eastern Mausoleum of Malan峪 was not continued with the Japanese side because he was attending the administrative conference in Tianjin. He will return to Tianjin tomorrow and return to Beiping to handle everything after the administrative conference closes. It is rumored that Yin and Tao are scheduled to visit Huang Fu this afternoon to report everything. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Encourages Liu Xiang</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Telegraphed Victory to the Capital</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin replied to Liu Xiang's telegram, saying that the central government is very concerned about the situation in Sichuan Province and is very pleased to hear of his reinstatement. He hopes that he will support the difficulties in the future so that the entire Sichuan Province can gradually be governed, which is what he expects. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei again yesterday, reporting on the defeat of the bandit He. According to a telegram from the front, in the battle of Shazichang, the commander of He’s pseudo-7th Division, Lu Dongsheng, was indeed killed. The pseudo-faction Zhong Caisheng was appointed, etc. The brigade has occupied Da Gai Mountain, and the bandits have retreated to Lingbingxi. The bandits in Longchi were also defeated by the brigade, and they have occupied Shi Cui Mu Wang, and the bandits have fled to Yinjiang. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Korean Vagrants Widely Establish Gambling Dens in Tangshan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) There are currently two "flower club" gambling dens and two "Bao Bureau" gambling dens established by Japanese and Korean vagrants in Tangshan, run by gangsters Gao Junpeng and Gu Laoer, luring men and women to gamble, and equipped with 30 bicycles to go to various villages to persuade farmers to come and gamble. The police chief is unable to ban them. Countless people have been bankrupted by gambling. Zhao Xun, the police chief of Tangshan, has requested Tao Shangming to negotiate with the new Japanese consul in Tianjin, Kawagoe, to ban them. Tao has negotiated once, but no results have been obtained. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Xun, the police chief of Tangshan, came to Tianjin this morning to request instructions on the security issues of the Kailuan mines in eastern Tangshan. He is waiting in Tianjin as Provincial Director Wei Jian has gone to Beiping and has not returned. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>The Third Route Army Recovers Ningdu</h3>
<p>Only Three Counties Remain in the Bandit Area</p>
<p>Yu Hanmou Arrives in Wujing to Supervise the Battle</p>
<p>Refugees from Changting Prepare to Return Home</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The General Headquarters announced the good news from the front.

<p>The Legislative Yuan Passes the Entire Amendment to the Criminal Code in the Second Reading</p>
<h3>Lengthy Discussion of the Crimes of Assault and Abortion</h3>
<p>A Third Reading Will Be Held on the 31st</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a general meeting on the 27th, both in the morning and afternoon. Sixty-three committee members, including Lin Bin, attended. Chairman Sun Ke passed the entire amendment to the Criminal Code in the second reading. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a general meeting at 9:00 AM on the 27th to continue discussing Chapter 22, the crime of murder, and Chapter 23, the crime of assault, Article 279 of the Criminal Code. There was no major dispute over the previous articles, and they were passed in the second reading according to the amendment. Article 280, "Anyone who knowingly has venereal disease and engages in indecent acts or adultery with others, causing them to be infected, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years, detention, or a fine of not more than five hundred yuan." Zhou Wei said that social interaction is now open, and there are many people suffering from venereal disease, which is transmitted to each other. It should be included in the chapter on security measures and given relief. Jiao Yitang said that this article should be deleted because the health administration can provide relief. Luo Ding and Liu Kejun said that anyone who knowingly has venereal disease and transmits it to others, whether a prostitute or a married couple, should be punished to protect the health of the people and strengthen the nation. Fu Bingchang said that, according to Italian law, it is more progressive to only punish those who knowingly have venereal disease and conceal it from others. Di Ying said that this article is new, and the penalty should be reduced during the trial period. Lü Zhiyi said that venereal disease does not include leprosy, which is also very harmful and should be included. After discussion, the chairman submitted it to a vote, and the article was amended to read, "Anyone who knowingly has venereal disease or leprosy and conceals it from others and engages in indecent acts or adultery, causing them to be infected, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than five hundred yuan." Zhou Wei also proposed including it in the chapter on security measures, which most committee members agreed to and was submitted to the Criminal Law Committee for research. Article 281, "Anyone who abuses a male or female under the age of sixteen or uses other methods to harm their natural physical development shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years, detention, or a fine of not more than five hundred yuan." Tao Lüqian said that Chinese people care about face and are afraid of being detained. If it is a fine, they do not care, so the fine should be deleted. Zhou Wei said that there are also people who have money and do not care about face, so both sides are well taken care of. Liang Hancao said that those who intend to profit by growing children into strange shapes and publicly exhibiting them should be severely punished. Zhang Guoyuan said that those who use other people's children as prostitutes should also be severely punished. Chen Changheng, based on Liang's meaning, requested adding an item, "Anyone who commits the crime in the preceding paragraph with the intention of making a profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than five years." The chairman submitted Chen's meaning to a vote, and most agreed, so it was passed in the second reading. There was no objection to Article 282. Chapter 24, the crime of abortion, Article 283, "(1) A pregnant woman who takes medicine or uses other methods to have an abortion shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, detention, or a fine of not more than one hundred yuan." "(2) A pregnant woman who follows others to have an abortion shall be subject to the same penalty." Wang Kunlun said, "(1) A pregnant woman should be allowed to have an abortion due to illness, (2) She can also have an abortion due to economic difficulties, because the children born in families that cannot afford to raise them are undernourished, and not raising them after giving birth is contrary to the meaning of breeding the nation. We advocate breeding the population, not the whole country being sick men or uneducated people." Lou Tongsun, Sun Weidong, and Yao Chuanfa said that China does not suffer from too many people but from too few people, but pregnant women who have abortions due to illness after being diagnosed by a doctor should not be punished. Jiao Yitang said that abortion violates customs, and strict restrictions should be imposed to maintain public order, so he advocated maintaining the original plan. The chairman then submitted it to a vote, and few people supported Jiao's proposal, and few people supported deleting it. Both were rejected. Most people supported indicating separately in the case that women with</p>
<p>diseases who have abortions after being diagnosed by a doctor should not be punished. The meeting was adjourned at noon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued the discussion at 2:30 PM on the 27th on Chapter 24, the crime of abortion, Articles 284 to 287; Chapter 25, the crime of abandonment; Chapter 26, the crime of obstructing freedom; Chapter 27, the crime of defamation and damaging credit; Chapter 28, the crime of obstructing secrets; Chapter 29, the crime of theft; Chapter 30, the crime of robbery, highway robbery, and piracy; Chapter 31, the crime of embezzlement; Chapter 32, the crime of fraud, breach of trust, and usury; Chapter 33, the crime of intimidation and kidnapping for ransom; Chapter 34, the crime of stolen goods; and Chapter 35, the crime of destroying and damaging property. All were passed in the second reading according to the amendment. However, in Chapters 25 and 26, according to Deng Zhexi and Jiao Yitang's proposal, Articles 311 and 317 of the original chapters were restored separately. The order and wording of the restored articles were organized and submitted by the chairman to the Criminal Law Committee for review and reserved for discussion before the third reading. The reason for the restoration was to promote the Chinese virtues of filial piety and to prevent children from abandoning or offending their direct blood relatives and elders. In addition, in Article 338 of Chapter 32, the "three" years of imprisonment was changed to "five." After the entire second reading was passed, Huang Youchang and Shi Shangkuan believed that the deletion of Article 234 greatly harmed marriage and family happiness and each proposed a new case as a remedy. The chairman also submitted it to the Criminal Law Committee for review and reserved it for discussion before the third reading. Secretary-General Liang Hancao reported that the 78th regular meeting would be held at 2:00 PM on the 31st to read the amendment to the Criminal Code for the third time, and the meeting was adjourned at 4:30 PM.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Respectful Word to the Academic Work Advisory Office and the Ministry of Personnel</h3>
<p>Ting</p>
<p>In late July of this year, the administrative authorities were stimulated by the vocational sports of Peking University students and decided to establish a National Academic Work Advisory Office to engage in three types of work: registration, investigation, and introduction. The Ministry of Personnel also intends to raise the issue of unemployment among graduates of specialized schools and above at the upcoming National Examination and Personnel Conference for discussion.</p>
<p>According to recent news, only one hundred and fifty registration forms have been issued by the Advisory Office, and only one hundred and twenty unemployed university graduates have come to register. We believe that the actual number of unemployed people must be more than this. The reason why the initial registration was not very enthusiastic is certainly related to the short period of time since the establishment of the Advisory Office, but the biggest reason is probably that the general unemployed feel that the Advisory Office's introduction lacks the certainty of obtaining employment. However, those one hundred and twenty people who implemented the registration did not hesitate to act because of this, which shows that their psychology of hoping to obtain employment and believing in the Advisory Office is indeed extremely strong. It has been no less than four months since the beginning of the summer vacation this year. According to our conjecture, among these one hundred and twenty people, with a few exceptions, at least four full months of unemployment have been suffered. It may not be bad for young people to suffer some hardships and setbacks within a considerable limit, but beyond that limit, it is inevitable to be disappointed, negative, and even desperate. The Advisory Office should certainly be particularly cautious in the initial stages of carrying out introductory work, but it must also recognize that it is a government agency that is very different from ordinary private-run introduction agencies. Even though its introductory scope is not limited to the government alone, government agencies account for the majority. Ordinary introduction agencies naturally need to pay attention to external credibility in recommending people for employment in order to maintain their own business. However, the Advisory Office, as a government agency, can recommend people to other government agencies without having to worry about this. In all fairness, under the current situation, the credibility obtained by this method of introduction will not be very superior. Therefore, the standard of talent it requires should not be very strict. If the Advisory Office's goal focuses on seeking true talent for those seeking employment and not on seeking life for those seeking work, the result will only be able to help a very small number of outstanding unemployed people, and it will inevitably ignore the majority of people. We believe that the first few introductions of the Advisory Office should pay special attention to the character and morality of the introduced person, and the standard of their knowledge and skills may be lowered somewhat. Its introductory scope should be as far as possible to seek resettlement in government agencies. In that case, the issue of external credibility will not arise. Only when there are considerable achievements in the first few times can it attract the attention of other unemployed people. As for what methods to use in the future to resettle graduates of specialized schools and above every year, it is certainly not something that the Advisory Office has the power to ask about. The overall solution to this matter is a problem of the political and social organization of the entire China. How easy is it to talk about? If only in terms of treating the symptoms, then it will mostly depend on the outcome of this examination and personnel conference.</p>
<p>We know that the Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan has long been seriously considering the issue of the future of graduates of specialized schools and above. Recently, it has been thinking of proposing at the examination and personnel conference that civil servants should hold an annual examination every year and a general examination every three years. Those with poor results will be eliminated. Higher examinations will be held once every autumn. The eliminated civil servants will be replaced by the successful candidates of each higher examination on a regular basis. Originally, a modern country's government should employ specialized talents as much as possible and should not limit itself to introduction. If the central and local government domains are mostly occupied by a portion of people, and those who occupy the domain mostly rely on their special background or mutual collusion to maintain their lives, then the result of unfair selection and excessive recruitment will naturally inevitably cause the resentment of knowledgeable unemployed youth. The proposal of the Ministry of Personnel this time, if it can truly be put forward and implemented, would indeed be the most practical and thorough method in the current environment. We hope that the authorities of the Ministry of Personnel will be able to implement their agreed proposals at the examination and personnel conference.</p>

<h3>The Puppet State's Revised Tariffs Cause Overstocking of Local Luan East Products</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet state’s revision of tariffs, effective from October 15th, levies taxes on products from our territory at more than double the previous rate. For example, a bolt of native cloth is taxed at 55 percent, and a yard of Qing City cloth must be sold for 3 jiao 4 fen when transported to Liaoshen to avoid losses. This has resulted in the inability of local Luan East products to be transported into the Northeast. This winter, the tax on each pair of felt shoes produced in Luan East is over 4 jiao. When transported into the puppet territory, each pair must be sold for over 4 yuan, including shipping costs. As a result, goods are piling up, affecting the economic activity of six or seven counties. (October 27th Special Dispatch)</p>

The firm had insurance for 500,000 yuan, and the losses are estimated at 100,000 yuan. (October 27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. Authorities Announce Japan's Desire to Dominate the Far Eastern Market</h3>
<p>Oil Issue Continues to be Negotiated with Japan</p>
<p>Japan's Disguise Makes Those with Knowledge Wince</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials stated today that the kerosene monopoly of "Manchukuo" is a way for Japan to exclude foreign commerce after it has dominated the Far East. The Manchukuo government's kerosene monopoly plan was released simultaneously with Japan's demands in the London Naval Talks, so its significance is unusually important. Although Tokyo claims that it has no connection with the matter, the outside world believes this to be a disguise, since Japan has clearly assumed responsibility for the diplomacy of "Manchukuo." Furthermore, the semi-official South Manchuria Railway of Japan will hold a majority stake in the monopoly company. As for the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman's claim that protests should be submitted to "Manchukuo," Washington officials are very cold to it and consider it to be cunning. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew will be ordered to continue negotiating this matter with Japan until a satisfactory result is obtained. Although "Manchukuo" is not a treaty country of the Open Door Policy, its officials have guaranteed that they will permanently maintain the Open Door Policy. Moreover, Japan has repeatedly stated that it will make every effort to maintain the Open Door Policy. The U.S. government firmly insists that the kerosene monopoly violates the various treaties signed by Japan and foreign countries. Britain and the Netherlands have also initiated negotiations. (October 26th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan and the Puppet Regime Collude</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the recent protests by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands to the Japanese government regarding "Manchukuo"'s policies violating the Nine-Power Treaty do not violate the treaty. It also believes that these protests should be submitted to "Manchukuo." (October 27th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo Foreign Ministry" issued a statement on the 27th regarding the protests from Britain and the United States based on the principle of equal opportunity in "Manchukuo" under the Nine-Power Treaty, stating that "Manchukuo" has not yet received the protest and cannot express an opinion. "Manchukuo" is a newly established country and should not be subject to the protest based on Article 3 of the Nine-Power Treaty. The declaration of the founding of "Manchukuo" has clearly stated the Open Door Policy. This is the national policy of "Manchukuo" and will not change. However, policies implemented under the sovereignty of "Manchukuo" will certainly not conflict with the Open Door Policy. (October 27th Japan United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After attending the cabinet meeting this morning, Minister of the Army Hayashi told reporters that Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are negotiating with Japan over the Manchukuo kerosene monopoly. In fact, such negotiations should be conducted with "Manchukuo." Manchuria has never prohibited foreigners, nor has it closed the door to foreign merchants. The Asahi Shimbun criticized this statement today, saying that "Manchukuo" has neither violated treaties nor violated the open-door policy of other parties. "Manchukuo" is an independent country and can freely manage industries such as the oil industry. Moreover, "Manchukuo" has not granted the monopoly to the Manchuria Oil Company. The organizational law of the company does not discriminate against or protect any foreigners. (October 27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Vilify Japan</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers today severely criticized Japan over the Manchukuo kerosene monopoly. The Daily Express editorial stated that there has never been a case of cynicism greater than Japan's reply regarding the Manchuria kerosene monopoly. The great powers, watching Japan's aggression and not daring to speak out for justice, have long since prepared a huge club for people to hit them on the back. Japan is now subtly pointing out that the great powers have created their own problems. In short, the kerosene monopoly is only the starting point. Talk of a tobacco monopoly is already rampant, and other events will follow in succession to show how Japan and "Manchukuo" uphold the principle of the open door. The Daily Mail stated that Japan will act as it pleases and do whatever it wants in Manchuria for the development of Japanese interests. Our task is to remember the Mutiny Empire and not forget it.

<h3>Recent Situation of U.S. Silver Purchases</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department announced today that the U.S. imported a total of 4,127,620 yuan of silver in the week ending October 19, compared to 2,011,984 yuan in the previous week. This time, 1,363,688 yuan were purchased from China, compared to 570,237 yuan in the previous week. This time, 1,651,779 yuan were purchased from the United Kingdom, compared to 248,408 yuan in the previous week. This time, 778,500 yuan were purchased from Mexico, compared to 829,245 yuan in the previous week. The Treasury Department also stated that the government's gold reserves are now 7,992,936,405 yuan, setting a new record. (October 27th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Sir Ouseley Samuel said in a speech in the Farnham area today that he hopes to sing the tune of raising world silver prices to increase the purchasing power of the East and revive world trade. He has now learned his lesson. President Roosevelt, in order to get the votes of the silver-producing states, is using artificial methods to raise silver prices and disrupt Chinese trade. President Roosevelt's move to destroy the principle of supply and demand has harmed U.S. trade with China, and Sino-British trade may also be affected. The Far East is bound to occupy an important part in the revival of world trade, but raising silver prices has only caused the revival of world trade to falter. (October 26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Egypt Prepares for Regency</h3>
<p>Cairo The King of Egypt issued an order today appointing Ahmed Ziwar Pasha as the leader of the cabinet. The King of Egypt has been ill for a long time, hence this appointment to enable him to act as regent, as the Egyptian constitution does not have a provision for establishing a regent when the King is indisposed.

<p>(London) Egypt today sent a letter of protest to the British Foreign Office through its Chargé d'affaires in Britain, objecting to the tone of British newspapers criticizing the Egyptian government's conflict with the British Agent. The British government immediately replied in stern terms, stating that British newspapers have freedom of speech, and that the British government has complete confidence in Paterson, the Acting Agent in Egypt. The Egyptian Agent is the former British Ambassador to China, Lampson, who is currently on vacation. The Egyptian Prime Minister accuses Paterson of interfering in Egypt's internal affairs.

<h3>Secessionist Movement in Australia</h3>

<h3>British Bombers to be Equipped with Cannons</h3>
<p>(London) British bombers will henceforth be equipped with gun mounts and cannons. The British Air Ministry recently ordered a number of such aircraft from British factories to avoid the difficulty of firing shells when the aircraft is flying at high speed. These aircraft can shoot accurately even when flying at a speed of 200 miles per hour, and the gunner can sit securely in the aircraft cabin to aim. No matter what position or situation the aircraft is in, the shells can hit the target. As for the firing of shells, it is all done automatically, the same as firing on the gun mounts of armored ships. (October 26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Thorns Between Britain and Japan Gradually Removed After Second Naval Negotiation</h3>
<p>Between the Washington Treaty and the Japanese Proposal</p>
<p>Britain Plans to Seek a Compromise, But It Is Still Difficult</p>
<p>(London) After two meetings between the representatives of Britain and Japan today on the naval talks, although the situation has not changed, the difficulties have been reduced. This morning, the British and Japanese representatives continued to discuss the outline of the Japanese proposal. In the afternoon, the Japanese Chief Representative Yamamoto, the British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, and a number of experts continued the discussion in a subcommittee. As a result of the two talks, Britain seems to have realized the details of the Japanese proposal and thus realized its practical scope. Since the Japanese representatives have not yet put forward any specific requirements, Britain is taking this opportunity to make arrangements in advance so that the negotiations can continue. Otherwise, once the Tokyo government's precise plan is put forward, the negotiations will be impossible. People are now seeking a compromise solution between the Washington Treaty and the Japanese proposal to avoid a naval arms race. It would be acceptable to acknowledge that the ratio of 5:5:3 in the Washington Treaty should be changed to 5:5:4. There is no great hope for this attempt, as the U.S. side has consistently adhered to its original position, and the Japanese side has also rejected the principle of naval ratios. Therefore, the British attempt to mediate has little chance of success. The British and American representatives are now scheduled to meet again on Monday of next week. The U.S. Chief Representative Davis and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira will meet tomorrow. (October 26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Proposals as Reported by the London Times</h3>
<p>Battleships Divided into Defensive and Offensive Types</p>
<p>Total Tonnage to Limit Offensive Warships</p>
<p>Defensive Warships at the Discretion of the Three Nations</p>
<p>(London) Although the Japanese delegation's verbal naval proposals have not been made public, The Times claims to be able to explain their general outline to its readers, stating, "Although the Japanese representatives have not submitted their proposals in writing, we have learned that they will divide warships into two categories: defensive and offensive. Aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers all fall into the category of offensive vessels, or in other words, what the London Treaty calls 'Class A' warships, and those equipped with guns of 6-inch caliber or greater. The Tokyo government wants to restrict these two types of warships separately. For example, the number and tonnage of offensive aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers that each country can possess should be uniform and without any leniency. In particular, Japan would not object to the complete abolition of aircraft carriers. Defensive warships, on the other hand, would include small-tonnage cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. So-called small-tonnage cruisers are those whose guns have a caliber of no more than 6 inches. Furthermore, the total tonnage of the three types of offensive warships should be restricted, while the allocation of tonnage for defensive warships can be freely determined by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In addition, although the Japanese delegation theoretically advocates absolute equality between the country's navy and those of the United Kingdom and the United States, it also stated that the Tokyo government does not actually intend to build a navy equal to those of the United Kingdom and the United States in practice. The country's navy will only reach the same high amount when necessary," and so on. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Says Understanding Has Been Reached with the UK</h3>
<p>Principles Set Before Numbers</p>
<p>(London) After the second Anglo-Japanese meeting, Plenipotentiary Matsudaira told reporters that during the second Anglo-Japanese conference, both sides had exchanged fairly in-depth opinions on important points and had discussed detailed points. Plenipotentiary Yamamoto also told reporters that during the Anglo-Japanese experts' meeting, there were fairly detailed questions about the Japanese proposal, but opinions were exchanged frankly. Whether the future will be in favor or against is another matter, but the contents of the Japanese proposal and Japan's attitude have been largely understood, and it can be judged what the future opinion of the Japanese side will be. At that time, numbers were not mentioned, and efforts were only made to advocate principles, but there was not much discrepancy between the claims of the two sides. Some differences were quite large, but the third point was largely reached. This time, Japan's attitude and international relations since the Manchurian Incident are largely different from those at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Although the United Kingdom put forward some numerical proposals, Japan only put forward fundamental policies such as a common maximum limit and did not mention numbers, because if the principle is recognized, subsequent problems can be expected to be resolved. It would be good to hold another meeting of experts, but it is generally expected that this will be the end of it. The meeting with American experts has not yet been decided. Furthermore, a tripartite meeting of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will not be held for the time being, as the initial purpose is to hold bilateral meetings separately. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The second Anglo-Japanese meeting, which was held on the 26th, was very tense. British Prime Minister MacDonald suggested that Japan should provide more specific and technical cases for the sake of holding the meeting and requested Japanese representatives to explain various technical points. The Japanese representatives explained that Japan considers the sudden defense of the maximum tonnage as a fundamental principle and hopes to conclude a new treaty and discuss specific details with the countries concerned under friendly relations. The most important point in the British side's questions was what is the specific number of the maximum tonnage that Japan is referring to? However, Japan did not state its number, only saying that it is willing to negotiate with various countries to determine this number. Furthermore, when implementing disarmament, offensive weapons such as aircraft carriers and battleships should be abolished or reduced first. (Nichiren dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Second US-Japan Meeting</h3>
<p>Japan Demands Absolute Equality</p>
<p>(London) After the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and U.S. naval representative Davis, it is generally known that the Japanese naval plan calls for absolute equality. This morning, Ambassador Matsudaira visited Davis, who kept him for lunch and held talks. Several points of the naval plan proposed by the Japanese delegation, (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senior government officials announced today that, according to the naval plan proposed by Japan, the total tonnage that the three naval powers should each obtain will be lower than Japan's current naval power. Japan's plan will greatly reduce armaments for the three countries, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, when the plan is completed, the naval ratio of the three countries will be 2:2:2 and 3:3:3. The senior official continued, saying that Japan anticipates that the United Kingdom and the United States will reject this plan. In that case, Japan will indicate concessions and establish a 3:3:3 ratio. A diplomatic discussion group released a world naval survey report today, stating that since 1931, Japan's military expenditure has doubled. Japan's military expenditure accounts for 25% of the total government budget, increasing to 43%, with no hope of nuclear reduction in the future. The report stated that the naval expenditures of all countries, except Germany, are higher than before the war. Currently, the military expenditures in the budgets of various countries account for 16% in the UK, 17% in Germany, 18% in the US, 20.8% in Italy, and 22.3% in France. (National dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Puppet State Issue Affects Naval Negotiations</h3>
<p>US and Japan Do Not Hold Experts' Meeting</p>
<p>(London) The naval preparatory meeting faces many difficulties due to Japan's new disarmament proposal. In addition to the disarmament issue, there are also sayings about the "Manchukuo" equal opportunity and the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and the atmosphere of the meeting is extremely delicate. The actions of the "Manchukuo government" have a direct interest in the United Kingdom, so general opinion circles attach importance to the "Manchukuo government." On the 27th, various newspapers strongly advocated that the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States lodge protests. How Japan and Manchukuo will handle this issue is a test of the open door policy. Business circles are unwilling to express their opinions because the new plans of the "Manchukuo government" have not yet been put into practical use. (Nichiren dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States delegations on the Japanese disarmament proposal are now generally clear. The United States delegation openly expressed opposition to Japan's proposal for a large disarmament plan. However, the British government's interests in reducing ship types are different from those of the United Kingdom, so although it opposes the Japanese proposal, it wants to be in a position to mediate between the United Kingdom and Japan. The United Kingdom wants to discuss the issue of ship types with Japan in the Experts Committee, but the Japanese representative insists on the policy of discussing principles first. What attitude the United Kingdom will take towards the Japanese proposal can be seen in next week's meeting. The attitude of the United States delegation is stronger than that of the United Kingdom, so there is no hope for a US-Japan Experts Committee to be held for the time being.

<h3>Siamese King and Queen Stay in Europe for a Long Time, Suddenly Causing Rumors of Abdication</h3>
<p>Displeased with the Article of Decapitation in the New Criminal Law</p>
<p>The Cabinet Ignores the King's Decree and Acts Its Own Way</p>
<p>Rumors of Abdication Now Denied</p>
<p>(London) A telegram came from Singapore this morning saying that the King of Siam intended to abdicate. The King of Siam's official documents today completely denied this claim to the Associated Press. This rumor was said to have originated from the British Embassy in Bangkok. The King of Siam's denial statement was entrusted by telephone from the King of Siam's residence in Krenlai to the Associated Press to announce to the world. The King and Queen of Siam have been in Europe for several months. The King of Siam's documents declared, "His Majesty is displeased with some articles in the new criminal law,"</p>
<p>It is true, and he still opposes the death penalty by beheading instead of shooting. This matter has now been decided. The Bangkok government has acted against the King's wishes, but this is not a reason for the King to abdicate. As for the deprivation of the King's veto power, nothing has been heard here," and so on. The documents also spoke on behalf of the King, expressing shock at the news from Singapore.

Purasat delivered the opening speech, vehemently criticizing the British White Paper policy and the Indian government's economic policy. He concluded by saying, "We are fighting with bare hands, with the weapon of morality, against a government equipped with the latest destructive machinery, to fight for justice. God will help us."

<h3>British Aviator Flies Back to London from Australia</h3>
<p>Plans to Set a Round Trip Record</p>
<p>Melbourne British aviators Jones and Waller arrived in Melbourne from London in less than five days, taking fourth place in the race. They flew back to London from here at 7:05 this morning, hoping to break the aviation record from Australia to England and set a new round trip record. Although the departure time this morning was very early, the send-off was very grand. According to the records, the aviation record from Australia to England is currently held by Morrison, who completed the entire journey in 8 days, 22 hours, and 25 minutes in August 1931. Jones and his partner are now flying back in the original plane, following the same route as before, but if possible, they plan to stop at fewer places along the way. The mechanic repaired the plane all night to ensure a smooth journey for the two aviators.</p>
<p>Several planes participating in the England-Australia Air Obstacle Race are still flying en route. According to the regulations, the deadline is the 16th.</p>
<p>So far, only four planes in the race have arrived safely at their destination. By noon today, another plane has flown to Australia. This plane is piloted by New Zealand aviators McGregor and Waller. They flew from Bulunait Tang to Croncori yesterday and plan to stop there briefly before heading to Charlie Zhen.</p>
<p>During the race, in addition to the unfortunate death of British Air Force officer Gilman and others a few days ago, another extremely unfortunate incident occurred last night. The plane piloted by Dutch aviators Asghis and Gaisen Dofer crashed into a car equipped with searchlights on the edge of the airfield when it took off from Allahabad last night, causing it to catch fire immediately and the entire plane was burned down. Fortunately, Asghis and others jumped out of the plane in time to avoid disaster and were not injured.</p>
<p>The plane that was ranked sixth in the process, piloted by Hewitt and Keyes, flew from Corbin to Darwin Port last night.</p>
<p>The seventh plane, piloted by Leach, flew from Batavia to Rumban yesterday. The eighth plane, piloted by Melrose, flew from Singapore to Darwin Port. The ninth plane, piloted by Hansen, has landed in Singapore. The tenth plane, piloted by Wright, is far behind and just arrived in Karachi yesterday. Staker and Tengler, who participated in the speed and obstacle races, withdrew shortly after and returned to England. They arrived in Marseille from Athens yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Although Japan has formally announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, it is still paying close attention to various League of Nations affairs. Recently, it has also taken action to seek its substitute participation in some parts. For example, it was learned today that Japan has subtly probed the powers on the issue of its relationship with the League of Nations after February next year. According to reliable sources, the Japanese government is eager to retain its official representative status on some League of Nations committees. The League of Nations also stated today that the Japanese government, in addition to participating in the League of Nations' social, cultural, and technical affairs, is also striving to maintain its voting rights in the Administrative Council when the League of Nations Administrative Council considers appointing new members to such committees. Japan's voting rights are stipulated in the 1931 Drug Control Convention. Given the recent developments, the question of what Japan's true relationship with the League of Nations will be in the future has now become a question that people in Geneva are speculating about.

<h3>US Bankers Meet with Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Cooperate to Promote the Recovery Movement</p>
<p>(Washington) Four officials of the American Bankers Association, led by the new chairman Hecht, met with President Luo today to inform him that</p>
<p>The Bankers Association is prepared to actively cooperate to promote the recovery movement, saying that bankers are very willing to lend to the industrial sector, and claiming that the four of them are members of the All-American Football Team composed of banking, agriculture, labor, and capital. Hecht will discuss a plan today to protect exporters from the danger of exchange rate fluctuations. The way to do this is to use a leveling fund to regulate export trade. Exporters who need to receive payment abroad can sell their foreign exchange to the leveling fund, and the fund will bear the risk of receiving payment abroad. This plan is currently being studied by a special committee composed of the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Important Railway in Northern Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Dalian Correspondence, 24th) According to news from the South Manchuria Railway Bureau, the new North Manchuria Railway line from Bei'an (transliteration) to Chengqin (transliteration), 136 kilometers long, will be opened to traffic on December 1. The above two locations are not found on ordinary maps, but they will soon become important centers. Bei'an is the junction of the Harbin-Bei'an line and the Qiqihar-Bei'an line, and Chengqin is not far from the border town of Heihe. The reason why this road is important is that it passes through a soybean production area and facilitates the transportation of troops. The South Manchuria Railway Bureau started construction of this line on April 4, 1933, and will soon hand it over to the Manchukuo government.</p>
<h3>Leningrad Public Library</h3>
<p>(Tass, Leningrad Communication, September 25) The Leningrad Saltykov-Shchedrin Public Library is second in scale only to the Library of Congress in the United States, so it ranks second in the world. The library has a collection of 6,250,000 volumes, and its readers are all over the Soviet Union. Before the revolution, the library had a collection of 3,500,000 volumes, ranking fifth in the world. After the revolution, the books collected by the royal family and important public libraries were incorporated, and the collection of books was greatly expanded. Among the library's treasures are 225,000 types of manuscripts and autographs. Regarding materials on Russia, there are more than 230,000 foreign-language "Russian Department" books, and Russian books have everything they should have. The famous Voltaire collection, with more than 8,000 volumes, is also one of the library's treasures. In addition, there are 2,100 of the oldest printed books, which are extremely important for the study of printing history. The books collected by the library are not only provided to readers in Leningrad, but also allow people across the country to enjoy them through the method of exchanging books with various libraries. The library's methods and experiences are often provided to other libraries and institutions. Various group activities are currently underway, such as allowing readers to ask questions or discuss the content of books. This work has been very effective. In recent years, the number of readers in the library has increased rapidly. It is estimated that the total number of readers in 1933 was 607,000, and the number of books used reached 1,850,000.</p>

<h3>French Radical Party Congress</h3>
<p>Nantai The Radical Socialist Party held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the report submitted by former Aviation Minister Gut. Gut's report was about diplomatic issues and the threat of war to the world. Gut said that the actions of the League of Nations have lost their effectiveness, and various nations have no credibility in it. However, due to current economic difficulties and the diplomatic isolation of Germany, there is no possibility of war breaking out in the short term. Gut said that we should strive for peace building, but the view of fully preparing to prevent conflict should not be adopted. The Radical Party urges France and Russia to approach each other. The Soviet Union is in favor of equal rights for all countries. International organizations cannot exist without equal rights. Gut then said, "Helio Pengu and Dara Di are both successors to Briand's achievements." Foreign Minister Barthou, who was brutally poisoned in Marseille, was also continuing the same policy. Barthou worked for peace until his death. At this point, the chairman of the conference, Xu Dang, ordered the audience to be silent for one minute to mourn Nan Wang Alexander and Barthou. Gut断 also requested the expansion of the powers of the League of Nations, saying that in order to solve the major international problems now, to break the arms race, and to make the old Europe have a flexible organization that can adapt to modern needs, the only way is to promote one method of the League of Nations Covenant. Gut also said that in order to maintain the progress already made in security, there must be universal disarmament internationally, and even if the scope of the disarmament convention is limited, it should be supplemented by a monitoring system. An international police force should be established to guarantee the safety of European countries. Gut believes that 1,000 well-equipped fighter jets are enough to be used as an international police force. Gut finally opposed private free manufacturing of military fire, demanding government control and gradually nationalizing the factories that manufacture military equipment.</p>
<p>Talbos, a member of the Radical Socialist Party, proposed a motion stating that "When there is a serious conflict between the two houses, or a serious conflict between the cabinet and the House of Representatives, only the people have the right to judge right and wrong."

The association advocates studying a draft to stipulate that when the government and the parliament conflict, the people can vote on the issues in dispute between the two parties, so as to maintain the solemnity of the principle of sovereignty in the people.</p>
<p>In the resolution prepared by the Radical Socialist Party Congress, there is a paragraph that says, "This congress supports all reform plans that aim to stabilize the cabinet and make political operations appropriate. However, various measures that increase personal power in the future to harm the freedom of the Republican system cannot be recognized." This paragraph was passed with four votes missing from the entire body. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Repairing the 60-Li Tang River in Haining</h3>
<p>Water and Drought Disasters Can Be Prevented</p>
<p>The Lives of Living Beings in Seven Districts Will Be More Secure</p>
<p>This year's drought in Zhejiang Province has been particularly severe in Haining. The Haining Drought Relief Association, together with charitable organizations in Shanghai, is currently handling emergency relief. However, due to the vastness of the disaster area, work relief is still necessary. Feng Liutang, a member of the association, suggested repairing the 60-li Tang River in the county as a form of work relief. This would not only prepare for water and drought and rescue disaster victims, but also prevent tidal disasters, providing more security for the lives of living beings in seven districts (Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, Taizhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou). This is a move that benefits in multiple ways. The original proposal roughly stated, "Thinking of the heavy disasters our county has suffered this year, although emergency relief has been raised and distributed, it is like a cup of water trying to put out a cartload of fire, only alleviating the immediate emergency. The days ahead are long, and severe cold is approaching quickly. We should urgently approach the issue from the perspective of work relief to appease the disaster victims and slightly ease the concerns for winter defense... Upon investigating the 60-li Tang River, which provides irrigation and drinking water for the people along the coast east of the city, it has been silted up for many years since it was dredged in the early Qing Dynasty and has never been properly managed. In the early years of the Republic, when Mr. Jie Wenliu was in Zhejiang, he recognized the necessity of repairing it during an inspection of Ning. He ordered a team to survey and estimate the work, but he left before it could be done. Since then, although local people have repeatedly appealed to the province and county for funds to redredge it, the silting of the Tang River has remained the same for more than 20 years, which is a pity. The river connects to the 25-li Tang River northwest of the city, which in turn connects to the Upper Tang River, which leads directly to Hangzhou. The so-called 'using the water of West Lake to irrigate the fields of Haining' is achieved through this connection. When there is surplus water in the Tang River, it is discharged into the Lower Tang River, such as the Yuanhua Tang River and the Zhangjiang Tang River. In this way, the network is interconnected, and the regulation is effective, with discharge appropriate for the situation, so there is no fear of floods or droughts. Since the 60-li Tang River has been silted up, there is no way to draw water during droughts and no way to store water during floods. Both water and drought become disasters, and the farmland water conservancy in the 60-li area is only seen to decline, not prosper. The people's livelihood is deteriorating, and there is not enough food. Families have no savings to protect against famine. This year, we have encountered a rare drought, making the hardship and suffering even more unbearable. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is issuing a large number of public bonds to fund work relief. The main details of the projects have been seen in newspapers, but are not detailed. However, it has not been mentioned how to carry out work relief in Haining, which has suffered the most severe disasters. It is unlikely that it has been abandoned. However, Liu believes that the most important work relief in our county is to repair the 60-li Tang River. The reasons are summarized below... (1) The 60-li Tang River starts outside the East Gate of Haining, extends eastward, and ends at Huangwan Town, occupying more than half of the county's area. Therefore, from the perspective of the majority of farmland water conservancy and rural revitalization, it should be dredged first. (2) The coastal customs are stronger, the land is barren, and it is more difficult to make a living. Dredging the 60-li Tang River will benefit the disaster victims along the coast east of Haining, preventing them from becoming destitute. Therefore, from the perspective of work relief and local security, dredging the 60-li Tang River is the most appropriate project. (3) From the perspective of tidal disasters, although there is a prepared embankment river for emergencies, if the 60-li Tang River is repaired, there will be a place for appropriate discharge, not only protecting the coastal area, but also providing more security for the lives of living beings in seven districts, which is more beneficial. As for the methods, (1) consult the old survey records and consider the current situation to estimate the work and calculate the costs. (2) Recommend representatives from the townships along the river to form a committee under the supervision of the province and county to oversee the entire river repair. Establish engineering offices in sections to manage the river work. (3) Request funds from the public bonds issued by the provincial government and implement them during the winter slack season. The above is only a summary of the main points. If it can be implemented, the disaster victims along the 60 li of the coast will benefit greatly, preparing for water and drought, and preventing tidal disasters. This is a move that benefits in multiple ways."</p>

<h3>Singapore Military Port Actively Deployed</h3>
<p>Zhangyi Designated as a Military Area</p>
<p>Military Port Can Be Completed Next Year</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The British transformation of the Singapore trading port into a military port has unimaginable implications for East Asia. Recently, a certain gentleman from the Singapore press visited Shantou, reporting that Singapore's naval, land, and air forces are being expanded. It is noted that in 1819, when Sir Stamford Raffles was the Governor of Singapore, he ordered the construction of a battery, equipped only with small 8-pound and 10-pound cannons. A brick and stone gunpowder depot and barracks were built on the coast, the barracks capable of holding only 30 soldiers. At the same time, two barracks were established for occasional emergencies. Two artillery troop barracks were also set up by the sea to protect ships, and a fort was set up at the mouth of the beach, garrisoned by a team of artillerymen. Raffles believed that in addition to this defensive equipment, a watchtower in the deep sea would make the defensive strength invincible. At that time, the forces stationed in the straits and Menggalian consisted only of the Second Battalion of the 20th Bengal Infantry Regiment, with its commander stationed in Singapore, Penang, and Menggalian. Who knew that everything would change by today? Singapore is a small island with an area of 220 square miles, and its naval, land, and air forces have been expanding year by year. The local people have many questions about this: Will Singapore become the "Malta" of the Far East, the "Gibraltar" of the East, or the strongest fortress in all British overseas territories? Is Singapore's current equipment sufficient to resist invasion by foreign naval, land, and air forces? These are all the questions that people in Southeast Asia have about Singapore today.</p>
<p>Today, the Singaporean army, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Li Rong, consists of an infantry battalion, two artillery brigades, and attached chemical teams, tram teams, anti-aircraft guns, tanks, engineering teams, cavalry teams, and more. Alert teams have also been established. In addition, there are two squadrons of torpedo bombers and a squadron of the fastest airships in the air force. In the Seletar Military Port, there are even more facilities, but no one knows when it will be finished. No one knows the actual strength of the troops stationed there. The British ship Maluanna, which regularly sails the England-Australia line via Colombo, came east in March of this year carrying seven officers and 300 soldiers to supplement the First and Second Anti-Aircraft Gun Squadrons. In the autumn of this year, it was learned that a heavy artillery squadron would arrive in Singapore, bringing the total to four types of artillery squadrons. Every military season, new officers and soldiers arrive from afar in an endless stream. Barracks and official residences are being built rapidly by hired Chinese workers, but they are not enough. Soldiers come and go like weaving between the small mountain at the foot of Wangjia Mountain and Fort Canning. The formerly quiet recreation area has been completely changed. The land of Zhangyi, with 1,690 acres on Singapore Island, has been designated as a military area. The entire hill of Mukagomatti has been designated as an artillery garrison. Artillery is also stationed in Palau Brani. Pulau Brani is a garrison for engineers. Mukagomatti and Pulau Brani are small islands near Singapore. The western gateway and the Johor Strait, the eastern gateway, both shield the military port of Singapore. The area of Alexandra has been designated for the construction of barracks for standing armies. Additional artillerymen can be stationed there later. Zhangyi District has been further expanded by 1,400 acres for military construction. New barracks are currently being built along the coastline from the 13 and a half stone marker to Tanjung Changi. The coastline shaded by coconut groves has been transformed into a military port that can accommodate large warships. The equipment was completed a year early. Previously, this place was a summer resort, but the government has notified all the small bungalows and swimming pools on the beach that they do not need to be repaired anymore, as they will soon be designated as military areas by the army. There are currently 15 barracks in Zhangyi, and nine newly built houses will be completed next year. Now that the army's power is so strong, military experts have decided that Singapore will be mainly based on the navy and air force. In 1935, the Seletar Naval Base will be completed, and as the air force's four-year plan is implemented, four squadrons of aircraft will come to Singapore. The navy and air force will continue to expand rapidly next year.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>In the London foreign exchange market this morning, the market was very quiet and unremarkable, except for occasional intervention by the Equalization Fund.

<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market opened steadily due to better news from Liverpool. Prices rose by three to four basis points, and sentiment improved. There is currently a government plan to have the Equalization Fund assume the exchange risk for US export trade. It is generally believed that if this measure is implemented, the export trade of various goods such as cotton can benefit.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat opened with little change from yesterday. According to general opinion, all aspects of the domestic situation are favorable to bulls. The amount of wheat needed for livestock is considerable. Even with foreign wheat, the supply may not be sufficient.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Before the opening of the New York stock market, a factor favorable to the market was the report on national retail trade, indicating that domestic sales continue to expand. A factor unfavorable to the market was the pressure currently on steel stocks. The commercial report for the third quarter was disappointing, leading to a trend of valuation based on actual income under current conditions. When securities opened this morning, the market was sluggish but still stable. Price fluctuations were small, and sentiment was increasingly pessimistic. The outlook for the near future is very uncertain. Operators expect that stock prices will still need to be tested once. The market prices of New York securities are listed below:</p>

<p>Those coming to Singapore from afar are constantly arriving. Barracks and official residences are being built rapidly by hired Chinese workers, but they are not enough. Soldiers come and go like weaving between the small mountain at the foot of Wangjia Mountain and Fort Canning. The formerly quiet recreation area has been completely changed. The land of Zhangyi, with 1,690 acres on Singapore Island, has been designated as a military area. The entire hill of Mukagomatti has been designated as an artillery garrison. Artillery is also stationed in Palau Brani. Pulau Brani is a garrison for engineers. Mukagomatti and Palau Brani are small islands near Singapore. The western gateway and the Johor Strait, the eastern gateway, both shield the military port of Singapore. The area of Alexandra has been designated for the construction of barracks for standing armies. Additional artillerymen can be stationed there later. Zhangyi District has been further expanded by 1,400 acres for military construction. New barracks are currently being built along the coastline from the 13 and a half stone marker to Tanjung Changi. The coastline shaded by coconut groves has been transformed into a military port that can accommodate large warships. The equipment was completed a year early. Previously, this place was a summer resort, but the government has notified all the small bungalows and swimming pools on the beach that they do not need to be repaired anymore, as they will soon be designated as military areas by the army. There are currently 15 barracks in Zhangyi, and nine newly built houses will be completed next year. Now that the army's power is so strong, military experts have decided that Singapore will be mainly based on the navy and air force. In 1935, the Seletar Naval Base will be completed, and as the air force's four-year plan is implemented, four squadrons of aircraft will come to Singapore. The navy and air force will continue to expand rapidly next year.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Autonomy Movement Under Japanese Rule</h3>
<p>Taiwanese People Suspend Petition for the Establishment of a Taiwan Parliament</p>
<p>Nakagawa Autonomy Case: City and Township Officials Are Half Elected by Officials and Half by Civilians</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: This year, the autonomy movement in Taiwan has been quite active. Taiwan Governor-General Nakagawa has therefore drafted a reform plan for the autonomy system, instructing Interior Bureau Chief Obana to take it to Tokyo to discuss it with the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. Since Japan occupied Taiwan, its policy of governing Taiwan has entirely adopted the methods of ruling colonies. The local people have absolutely no political power. In recent years, although autonomous organizations have been established in various cities, towns, and villages in Taiwan, the councilors of these cities, towns, and villages are completely appointed by the government and are not elected by the people. Therefore, it is still an official governance system. The political movement of the Taiwanese people, at its most intense eight years ago, organized the "Minzheng Party," led by Jiang Weisui, and published the "Taiwan Xinminbao" weekly as its organ, expressing great sympathy for our country's Kuomintang. Its mode of movement took the parliamentary policy of democratic politics, making movements for autonomy and the establishment of a Taiwan Parliament. Jiang was originally the son of a poor man. Later, the Governor-General of Taiwan released hundreds of hectares of official wasteland for Jiang to develop. Jiang was thus seen by the general public as a landlord class, and his attitude gradually became more moderate, resulting in the loss of general faith. Thus, internal divisions also arose. Later, Jiang died of pneumonia, and the Minzheng Party disintegrated. Except for some radicals who turned into revolutionary secret societies, the majority of the Minzheng Party members tended toward Japan's appeasement, and the Xinminbao was changed to a daily newspaper. Its attitude became one with the Japanese. The autonomy movement that has arisen this year is being presided over by members of this Minzheng system. Its main objectives are (1) to establish a Taiwan Parliament (like the Philippines) and (2) to have the councilors of the autonomous organizations of cities, towns, and villages be entirely elected by the people. Its leaders are Lin Xiantang, Yang Zhaojia, and others. Among them, Yang is especially a backbone. Yang is still young, a student who has studied in Japan, and his family is wealthy. He is really a big landlord in Taiwan, and he has extensive contacts in Taiwan and Tokyo. Taiwan Governor Nakagawa is currently loudly advocating in Taiwan that "Taiwan is the front line of national defense, uniting against foreign countries." To ease the Taiwanese people, he has drafted a reform plan for the autonomy system: (1) half of the city, town, and village councilors are elected by civilians, and half are appointed by officials; (2) cities are decision-making bodies, and towns and villages are advisory bodies. According to Taiwan's so-called autonomy system, cities are equivalent to our country's county and city councils, and towns and villages are equivalent to our country's township and street neighborhood system. It has been decided that the system will be implemented in Showa 10 (i.e., next year). After the Taiwan Governor made the decision, the Taiwanese side expressed dissatisfaction, but there was no active opposition. At the same time, in the early part of last month, a meeting of "people of goodwill from all over the island regarding the rule of Taiwan" was convened in Taichung. As a result of deliberation, the approval of those of goodwill from all over the island who care about the rule of Taiwan was solicited, and an opinion was submitted to the Governor-General of Taiwan, and signatures were collected for a petition to establish a Taiwan Parliament. The following agreement was made: "We, in view of the recent domestic and international situation, suspend the petition for the establishment of a Taiwan Parliament." September 2, Showa 9, Lin Xiantang, Chen Xin, Huang Chaoqing, Luo Wanche, Wen Chenglong, Yang Jixian, Lu Lingshi, Zhuang Suixing, Lu Panshi, Chen Shuofang, Xu Jiazhong, Ding Ruitu, Cai Xianyu, Xie Yaodong, Yang Zhaojia, Chen Fengyuan, Cai Nianxiang, Cai Shigou, Huang Chengcong, Lin Boting, Lin Cheng recording, Xie Rongzhong, Zheng Songyun, Guo Fa, He Jingliao, Liao Decong, Lin Jietang, Zhang Shenlei, Wu Haishui, Shen Rong, Wu Qiuyi, Wu Wenlong, Lin Hu, Qiu Dejin, Hong Yuanhuang. In addition, for the opinion on the rule of Taiwan, Lin Xiantang, Yang Zhaojia, Cai Shigou, Chen Xin, Ye Rongzhong, Lin Chenglu, Zhuang Suixing, Chen Fengyuan, and other eight people were selected as drafting members. Recently, the approval of the people of the entire island has been obtained. Seeing this, the petition for the establishment of a Taiwan Parliament has been withdrawn. Also, Interior Bureau Chief Obana went to Tokyo to contact the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs had no objection to Nakagawa's original plan for half of the city and township councilors to be elected by officials and half by civilians, and for the city to be a decision-making body. As for the town and village being an advisory body, it is more reasonable for the town and village to be a decision-making body. Autonomy must first be decided by the town and village decision-making bodies. It has not yet been decided. Nakagawa went to Tokyo on the 17th, and Princes Fushimi and Nashimoto visited Taiwan last month and this month. They will discuss the Taiwan autonomy case with the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. Also, the Governor-General's Office's budget proposal for Taiwan Showa 10 nominally lists 500,000 yuan for autonomy expenses, with a final budget of 380,000 yuan. Taiwan's so-called autonomy problem, the city council is a decision-making body, and half are elected by officials. The town and village are only for consultation, and the meeting to establish the Taiwan Parliament has been revoked. In reality, it is still official governance, and the Taiwanese people cannot do anything about it. As for the visit to Taiwan by Princes Fushimi and Nashimoto, it is to promote the "Taiwan National Defense First Line, Southern Gate Key" movement, not for autonomy. (22nd)</p>
<h3>War Zone Clearance Committee to Be Established on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>Will Be Done Step by Step</p>
<p>War Zone Can Become More Stable</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The organizational regulations of the War Zone Clearance Committee, after being carefully drafted by Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others, were submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Political Consolidation Council (and have been approved, and it has been determined that it will be formally established on the first of next month. The preparations, the tasks it is responsible for, and the candidates for committee members are described below.</p>
<h3>Preparation Process</h3>
<p>After Huang Fu returned north, he realized that all the unresolved issues within the "war zone" urgently needed resolution. Although the Luanyu Jimmi Special Commissioner Office was responsible for these matters, Huang still felt that, due to various logistical and practical considerations, it was necessary to establish a dedicated agency to take charge of the cleanup. The organization of the "War Zone" Cleanup Committee originated from this need. After Huang summoned Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, and others for detailed discussions, they decided to proceed with preparations. The committee's structure was extremely simple, and the required funding was minimal.</p>
<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>According to one of the committee members, the committee's tasks can be broadly divided into two points: (1) to resolve all outstanding issues, both internal and external, in the counties within the "war zone"; and (2) to guide the county magistrates in preventing all kinds of disputes. Regarding the former, "external" refers to negotiating with the Japanese side on matters that the Japanese side should fulfill, while "internal" refers to paying attention to public security facilities and providing guidance on the training of security teams. Regarding the latter, the aim is to prevent the occurrence of all unfortunate events. Chairman Huang's establishment of the Local Administrative Personnel Training Institute is precisely for this purpose. However, under the current circumstances, the Cleanup Committee will provide guidance first. By proceeding step by step in this manner, the situation in the "war zone" should become increasingly stable.</p>
<h3>Reason for Postponement</h3>
<p>After the organizational regulations of the committee were approved by the Executive Yuan, the official establishment was originally scheduled for the 25th. However, some committee members, such as Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming, are currently attending the first phase of the Hebei Provincial Administrative Conference in Tianjin, and committee member Zhu Shiqin is currently in the south. All of them must return to Peiping by the end of the month. For this reason, it was decided to postpone the establishment to the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Committee Member Selection</h3>
<p>The list of committee members has not yet been announced. It is understood that a total of seven people have been confirmed: Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Zhu Shiqin, Yue Kaixian, and Xu Shousheng. Three standing committee members will be appointed from these seven, namely Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, and Zhu Shiqin. Under the standing committee members, there will be one chief secretary, to be filled by Wang Bihou. The committee's staff will be transferred from the Political Reorganization Council without additional salaries, in order to save public funds. The full text of the committee's organizational regulations and the list of committee members will be announced separately by the end of this month at the latest.</p>
<h3>Cleanup Period</h3>
<p>According to the organizational regulations, the legally defined existence period of the committee is six months. During these six months, all outstanding issues within the "war zone" will be resolved. If the time is insufficient, the Political Reorganization Council will extend it as appropriate at that time.

<h3>Northwest Inspection Report</h3>
<p>By our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Residents Fortifying Themselves</p>
<p>Wuwei, 24th. Reverend and Mrs. He of the Gospel Church are planning to go to Xinjiang in the future, and they are also traveling on the same vehicle. However, it is heard that the new road is still blocked, and they plan to get off at Jiuquan to wait for another opportunity. This morning, we passed through villages and settlements such as Guojiapu, Sishilipu, Huaianyi, and Changlongbao. Most of the people's dwellings are desolate. After traveling more than sixty li, six or seven out of ten of the fields we saw were embankments. Due to the ravages of mountain floods, they have all been eroded, with cobblestones the size of fists covering the ground, like the "sandy land" of Longdong. Unfortunately, it cannot be cultivated like sandy land. The road is full of gravel, and the vehicle travels bumpily. There are no fewer than twenty large and small rivers. When crossing, we mistakenly sank into a deep spot, and water poured into the footboard, infiltrating the oil pipe in the vehicle box and expelling the engine oil, causing us to stall in the middle of the stream. Later, we were pulled out by another vehicle or hired people to drag us out. The traffic was delayed by this more than a dozen times. As for the passersby, in order to facilitate crossing the river, they simply took off their pants and held them up while walking, putting them on only when they reached their destination. Although onlookers felt it was unseemly, they were calm and unconcerned.</p>
<p>From Lanzhou westward to Jiayuguan, the edges of the Great Wall are intermittent and run parallel to the post road. In the past, the only beacon towers for reporting border police and transmitting news were arranged every five li along the way, with five towers in each group. The ordinary height is one cubic zhang. In strategic locations and the Gobi Desert outside the pass, the distance is slightly longer, with some towers reaching three or four zhang in height, and fortified camps are built next to them. However, due to the passage of time, most have collapsed and are in disrepair. Only in the northeast townships of Yongchang in western Wuwei, where people live scattered, do they still maintain the Ming Dynasty tradition of preparing for northern invaders, fortifying themselves individually. That is, outside their dwellings, they build two or three additional walls, with watchtowers in the middle, also three or four stories high, in a tight formation, resembling the blockhouses newly built in Jiangxi. In this way, Japan wanted to reach Yongchang, but because the mud was plentiful and watery, they stopped and bivouacked under the moonlight on a certain section of the road in the eastern township of Yongchang, arriving late. When we inspected the next morning, we saw that the green mountains on the left and right had already changed into snowy garments.</p>
<p>Then we packed up and set off, passing through the villages of Sanshilipu, Sunjiazhuang, and Donggang. At 11:00 a.m., we arrived at Yongchang City. From Wuwei to here, it should have been 160 li, but according to the car's odometer, it was only 32 English miles, which is approximately 106 li. The city wall is three zhang high, and the crenellations are intact. The car entered through the east gate and immediately exited through the west gate. The defending soldiers, suddenly seeing the vehicle, did not conduct an inspection, but saluted instead. In the center of the city, there is a building, four stories high, standing tall in the clouds, with countless plaques. Facing east, it reads "Simple Customs and Beautiful Folkways"; facing west, it reads "Gentle Embrace of the Western City." The lettering is bold and vigorous, giving a sense of spirit. Trees are planted along the road, with trunks only as thick as an arm span, but the branches and leaves are luxuriant and delightful. Among them, some are more than four zhang high, and their ancient beauty is especially worth seeing. There are also many other temples, but the people on the streets seem sparse.</p>
<p>Yongchang lacks water conservancy, so land prices are very low. The area of rented land is rarely measured in "dou" or "mu," but mostly in terms of "how many days and nights of water." For example, a certain villager gathers 250,000 cash to rent land for "one day and night of water." The so-called one day and night of water means that when mountain floods erupt, within the designated range of the rented land, the villager can divert water as much as possible for irrigation, for a period of one day and one night. Wherever the water reaches, that defines the boundaries of the rented land. This is called renting land for "one day and night of water," commonly abbreviated as "renting one day and night of water." There are also those who rent for one day and a half of water, or two days of water or more. The water varies in size, and the land varies in slope, so the area covered varies. However, according to farmers, one day and night of water can generally irrigate an area sufficient to sow about 20 shi of wheat. If rainfall is timely, the harvest will be about 80 or 90 shi (each shi of wheat weighs 300 jin, worth 30 yuan). Otherwise, in alternate years, only one planting is possible, or only part of it can be planted. In addition to the regular grain tax paid by the landlord, the tenants are responsible for other taxes and levies, such as two dou of military grain and 300 jin of military fodder for each shi of land. When the lease expires after 10 or 20 years, the landlord returns the deposit of 250,000 cash to the tenant in full, and the contract is terminated. If the land gradually becomes fertile, the tenant can pay a small rent and request to continue cultivating without returning the land. However, this kind of situation was more common more than ten years ago. Now, because water conservancy has been neglected and production has sharply declined, while the farmers' burden has increased, requests from tenants to continue cultivating are practically non-existent. As for the Jinchuan River basin, the riverbanks are shaded, and the sound of watermills can be heard for several li. The soil is fertile, and the scenery is beautiful, but although land prices are relatively high, there has been no special improvement.</p>
<p>West of Yongchang, villages can be found every ten or more li. The area is located in the upper reaches of the Jinchuan River, with green grass and clear streams everywhere. However, most of the dwellings have collapsed, and the clothing of men and women is tattered, all due to the repeated effects of calamities. It is truly unbearable to witness. Passing through Kongxindun (40 li from the city), on the roadside is a monument erected to commemorate the merits of General Zhang Chen of the Ming Dynasty. The moss is mottled, and it is leaning as if about to fall. At Shiquanyi Station (15 li), there are many dwellings, but only five or six middle-aged women are visible, all wearing a sorrowful expression. I was hungry and tried to buy food, but there was nothing for sale. More than ten years ago, this was a famous post station. Today, it has declined so much that it is chilling to think about. At Guchengguo (20 li), the Rile County of the Han Dynasty was once located here. The ancient fort is dilapidated, and there are only a few houses left, almost all in ruins. However, a Kuixing Pavilion with three stories is being built in the east of the village. The rafters and pillars have already been erected, but there is no strength to cover it with soil and tiles. The wood is gradually losing its new color. It is lamentable that in such a dilapidated rural area, people are still engaging in superstitious construction. The ignorance of the rural people is pitiable, and the lack of rural education is even more alarming. After ten more li, the mountains on the north and south gradually converge to form a canyon, called the Shandan Gorge. Looking south at Yanzhi Mountain, the layered peaks are covered with snow, winding like a painting. Many people collectively call it Qilian Mountain, but it is actually the northward branch of the Qilian Mountain range. The mountains are rich in medicinal materials, the most abundant being rhubarb. There are also red and blue plants that can be used as dyes. In the past, Emperor Wu of Han sent generals to capture the two mountains of Qilian and Yanzhi. The Xiongnu sang, "Losing my Qilian Mountain makes my livestock unable to prosper. Losing my Yanzhi Mountain makes my women lose their color."</p>
<p>The Shandan Gorge is strategically important. Exiting the gorge is the Xiakouyi Station. The border is a city, and the residents are still lively. At Fengchengpu (15 li) and Xinheyi Station (25 li), we stayed for the night. From Yongchang to the north, the distance is 49 English miles, which is approximately 162 li. Xinheyi Station belongs to Shandan County. There is an earthen fort, about three li in circumference, but it has mostly collapsed. There are more than a hundred households of residents. Hui people run shops, and Han people mostly engage in farming and animal husbandry. Suddenly hearing the arrival of the vehicle, the crowd gathered around to watch. Middle-aged and elderly people wear cotton or woolen clothing (woven with wool), with a piece of red cloth, approximately four square inches, sewn on their left shoulders, and they wear old coins or talismans to ward off illness and evil spirits. Boys aged twelve or thirteen do not wear clothes or pants, but wear iron chains around their necks, not removing them even in winter, believing that praying for blessings will prevent illness. Girls also do not necessarily wear pants, but their feet must be bound. I made attempts to persuade them to unbind their feet and abandon superstitions, but I don't know if they understood. There is a Temple of Guan Yu, but the buildings are old and dilapidated. Among the stone tablets, there is a "Shandan North Mountain Han-Yi Boundary Tablet" from the ninth year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, which roughly states that Han people can still gather food within 60 li outside the edge of the Great Wall, while beyond 60 li is the grazing land for the Mongols. Other temples, such as the Temple of the Jade Emperor and the Temple of the Three Officials, are even more dilapidated than the Temple of Guan Yu. The Buddha statues are exposed, and the residents have each built mud holes in accordance with their positions to store them. The cramped and absurd situation causes everyone who sees it to laugh and be amazed.</p>

<h3>Two Ice Factories Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Yesterday (27th) at 11:00 AM, a fire broke out accidentally at the Tianhu Ice Factory on the shore of Huxiao Pond outside Xumen. Two ice storage buildings were reduced to ashes. At the time, due to a strong south wind, the Public Prosperity Old Ice Factory, more than ten zhang away, was also affected, and three ice storage buildings were destroyed. The fire was extinguished at 12:00 PM. The losses of the two ice factories are estimated to be over 10,000 yuan, and 300 dan of farmers' rice straw were also burned. It is heard that the fire was started by a deaf and mute beggar who was cooking near the factory at the time. He abandoned the fire in the factory building, causing it to be burned down. The beggar fled and disappeared after realizing that he had caused the disaster.</p>
<h3>Local Opium Paste Shops Open for Business</h3>
<p>All local opium paste shops in Wu County have now opened. 15,000 taels of opium paste have already been transported to Suzhou, and another 8,000 taels can be transported to Suzhou immediately. The Anti-Opium Association summoned the operators of the local opium paste shops yesterday (27th) for a briefing and stipulated that the price of opium paste should be 2 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen per tael.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank Improves Weiting Woolen Blanket Industry</h3>
<p>The woolen blanket industry in the Weiting district outside Loumen used to sell well both domestically and internationally, with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of yuan. Now, due to a lack of innovation and capital, it has declined severely. To revive this industry, the Farmers Bank plans to issue cash loans in Weiting. There are currently 500 weaving households in the district, residing in 11 villages. The Agricultural Bank plans to encourage these weaving households to jointly form a cooperative, with a branch in each village, to jointly purchase raw materials, improve weaving techniques, and store, transport, and sell their products. It is estimated that in the first year after implementation, the output can be increased to 256,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>County Government Holds Autumn Survey Meeting</h3>
<p>This year's drought is extremely severe, and various districts have reported crop failures. The County Government previously dispatched investigators to conduct surveys, and the Liangting also sent Ye Tiesheng and Tang Xixiang to Wuxi to conduct re-surveys, which have been completed. However, the Civil Affairs Department has now sent Wang Weifan to Wuxi to conduct a re-survey. As the reports of crop failures submitted by various districts are still incomplete, County Magistrate Yan specially convened a meeting of the district chiefs and bureau chiefs to discuss the autumn survey. It was decided that, except for the first, second, sixth, and tenth districts, where there was a significant difference in the numbers surveyed by the provincial committee, a reasonable adjustment should be made to the percentages. The remaining districts should submit two copies of the failure report within one week, based on the listed numbers of completely failed disaster-stricken fields. (2) The first district requested an increase of 1,950 mu, requesting an additional 10%.</p>
<h3>Ministry Commissioners Come to Wuxi to Inspect Factories</h3>
<p>Lu Dihuan, Head of the Hygiene Section of the Central Factory Inspection Office of the Ministry of Industry, and Commissioner Qin Hongji, were ordered to come to Wuxi to inspect the types and actual conditions of occupational diseases occurring in various factories. They will begin by examining the physical condition of the workers in order to supervise the completion of the first phase of factory inspection in this county. At the same time, they will also handle factory registration, which has been instructed by the Construction Department to the County Government. Yesterday, Lu and Qin, accompanied by Cheng Qiyuan, a factory inspector from the Jiangsu Construction Department, came to Wuxi and stayed at the Wuxi Urgent Hotel. They immediately visited the County Government Construction Bureau, met with Secretary Ye and Director Zhang, and requested that personnel be dispatched to assist in the inspection. Hu Wenyu, a staff member of the Workers' Section of the Central Party Headquarters Mass Movement Committee, also came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to meet with Xu Chizi of the County Party Committee to discuss issues such as restoring the General Labor Union and to investigate the labor movement.</p>
<h3>Suzhou-Changzhou Area</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Opium Addicts Surround the Anti-Opium Association</p>
<p>Recently, the Public Security Bureau has been extremely strict in arresting opium addicts, causing panic among the general addicts, who have nowhere to smoke. On the morning of the 25th, the Public Security Bureau arrested Sun Daxing, who ran a smoking and sales establishment, causing a great uproar among the opium addicts. Opium addicts and the owners of 42 smoking and sales establishments in the city area were summoned to a meeting upstairs in the Weichahu Teahouse in front of the temple. More than 400 opium addicts attended. It was decided to petition the County Anti-Opium Association and use the return of the security deposit as a condition for negotiation. After the discussion, hundreds of opium addicts marched towards the Anti-Opium Association. When they reached Tacang, they sent Gu Jinhong, He Zhixiang, and three others as representatives, while the rest surrounded the gate, quietly awaiting news. After arriving at the association, the representatives presented their opinions. Cao Junzai, a member of the investigation department of the association, replied: (1) Before the formal licenses are issued, each sales and smoking establishment is allowed to make preparations. (2) License holders are allowed to smoke with one lamp and one pipe. After the representatives informed the opium addicts, they were satisfied, and the crowd dispersed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou-Changzhou Area</h3>
<p>New District Chief of the Fourth Water District Takes Office</p>
<p>After the Provincial Government decided to appoint Wang Tianchi as the new District Chief of the Fourth Water District, Wang officially took over yesterday. The former District Chief Gong went to the Civil Affairs Department to report on the handover process. At the same time, the leaders of the major brigades in the district, in view of the long-standing problems of public security on the water and the extremely difficult financial situation, gathered in the province during this transition period to seek a comprehensive improvement. Xu Hongjin, leader of the 15th Brigade, Huang Tianmin, leader of the 16th Brigade, Liao Ziying, leader of the 17th Brigade, Zhang Liyou, leader of the 18th Brigade, and Yin Xiongfei, leader of the 19th Brigade, paid a visit to the Director of the Civil Affairs Department to request instructions on reorganization measures.</p>
<h3>County Conducts County-Wide Traditional Chinese Medicine Certification</h3>
<p>The Zhen County Government previously received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to promulgate the "Jiangsu Province Regulations for the Management of Traditional Chinese Medicine Certification" and the "Forms for Resume Guarantee and Teacher Certification." It was stipulated that certification should be conducted every May and October, and the County Organizing Certification Committee was instructed to strictly comply with and report. It also received a telegram from the Civil Affairs Department, requesting that it immediately submit certification documents and related procedures to the County for application for a business license. From the date of the announcement, there will be a ten-day period for application. Those who have not applied or have applied but failed the review should promptly register at the County Government Dispatch Office to await submission of a request for periodic certification. A fifteen-day registration period will be allowed from the date of the announcement.</p>

<p>Drowning of Boatman During Civilian Boat Levy</p>
<p>Yang Zean, a native of Henan, worked as a boatman. He recently transported grain to Wuhu and sailed to Yangzhou. His boat was docked in the west of Lujin Town. However, Tang Xing, a town soldier, was tasked with levying civilian boats. He took his younger brother Xijun with him to levy in the river. When Yang saw this, he moved his boat to another location. Xijun ordered him to stop moving and boarded the boat to reprimand him severely. Yang's younger brother, Yang Si, still ignored him and set sail, lost his footing, and fell into the water and died. Zean, grieving over his brother's death, grabbed Xijun and took him to the local water police, who sent him to the Jiangdu Court. After a hearing by the District Prosecutor's Office, Tang Xijun was detained. Yesterday morning (26th), Prosecutor Meng went to conduct an examination.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

<p>Huai River Diversion to Sea Project News</p>
<p>The Huai River diversion project was originally planned with both routes, into the Yangtze River and into the sea. Now, the Provincial Government is focusing on the sea diversion project and established the Sea Diversion Engineering Office in Qingjiang on the 1st of this month. Director Xu Xinwu and Deputy Director Chen Hefu are carrying out all the work. Although Director Xu is currently on leave due to mourning, Deputy Director Chen and Chief Engineer Ge Hanlou are still working day and night to supervise the work. Regarding the surveying work, Team Leader Sun Zenrong has completed the on-site survey, which measures approximately 160 kilometers from Yangzhuang in Huaiyin to Taozikou entering the sea in Funing. It has been decided to use the abandoned Yellow River channel above Qitao in Lianshui, and below Qitao to the sea, a new river with a bottom width of 35 meters will be excavated, with a total excavation of 66.6 million cubic meters. The number of workers to be recruited in each county and the length of the engineering sections have been announced: 20,000 people in Huaiyin, section leader Wu Guoxian; 20,000 people in Huaian, section leader Zhang Hongchang; 25,000 people each in Lianshui and Funing, section leaders Lu Yuanxu and Zhou Baohongqi; 15,000 people in Yancheng, section leader Lü Qingquan; 10,000 people each in Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, and Siyang, section leaders Guan Cheng, Chen Lihui, Mao Feng, and Pan Jiwen; and 5,000 people each in Jiangdu, Taixian, and Dongtai, section leaders Jiang Xingxiao, Zhong Qiwen, and Gao Yunchang.

<p>Bandits Rampage and Shoot Victim</p>
<p>The home of Bao Shaoting in Puxiang Township, District 8 of the county, was broken into by a group of bandits at dawn on the 25th. They broke open the gate and entered the house with the intention of looting. At that time, Shaoting tried to escape, but the bandits shot him, hitting Bao in the buttocks, and he fell and died in the ditch to the west. Bao's wife, Shen, was seriously injured. The bandits then looted as they pleased and left in a roar. Afterwards, Bao Shaoting's younger brother, Bao Shaozhu, filed a report with the County Government requesting investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>Rice Boat Capsizes, Six Drown</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a rice boat from Xingyi in the northeast of District 5 of this county capsized in Shagou Lake. It was carrying a boatload of rice and over ten passengers, a total of 18 people. However, the boat was small and heavily loaded, causing the boat to sit low in the water. The boatmen tried their best to row out, but the rudder was damaged, and at the same time the boat capsized in the lake, and everyone fell into the water. The fishing boats in the lake discovered the incident and came to the rescue, but only 12 people were rescued, and the other six drowned.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Sudden Objections to Highway Project</p>
<p>The Provincial Government believed that the construction of a highway was necessary between the Caojianong bus station and the Pinghu bus station and instructed the Provincial Highway Bureau to order Ding Shouchang, the former director of the Pingjia section engineering office, to conduct a survey along the route with staff members and begin construction soon. However, Shen Songqing and other elders of the county came out in opposition and submitted a petition to the County Party Headquarters, stating that recently, engineers sent by the Provincial Highway Bureau had established an office to rebuild the Zhaping Highway and were surveying and enclosing land, working intensely, which caused anxiety among the people. They stated that in the 17th and 18th years, land was enclosed twice, but the land price was never paid, and the land tax was never waived. Now, enclosing land again would inevitably increase the people's losses, which was a cause for concern. The route from Quan Gong Pavilion in this county, passing through Huanggu Fang, Dayan Fang, Chujing Fang, Qingxi Fang, and Xujia Dai Township to the south gate of Pinghu, all passes through high-quality farmland. This year, the drought has been a disaster, and the Provincial Government is discussing relief measures. It seems inappropriate to rebuild the highway at this time, which would cause much unrest. They requested that the Provincial Party Headquarters be forwarded to the Provincial Government, ordering the relevant departments to immediately stop the reconstruction project and withdraw the personnel stationed in Pinghu in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. It is heard that the County Party Headquarters has approved their request and forwarded it to the Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Visited Ningbo Yesterday</h3>
<p>He will make a short trip and return to Shanghai in a few days.</p>
<p>He visited the City God Temple and the Guohuo Company in the morning.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 23rd, Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government visited friends and extended his visit to national physician Lu Zhong'an to treat his old ailments. Yesterday morning, he made a brief trip to the City God Temple, then went to the Nanjing Road Dalu Department Store, to visit the China National Products Company and Ms. Chen Sixuan's painting exhibition. At 5:00 PM, he boarded the Ningxing ship of the Sanbei Company to Ningbo, making a short trip. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Visiting the City Temple</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, Chairman Lin, accompanied by a servant, drove to the Chenghuang Temple (City God Temple) gate on Fangbang Bridge in the city. After the car stopped, he got out and walked into the temple for a visit. He was dressed in a black cloth mandarin jacket, a blue cloth lined robe, a felt hat, and leather shoes. He carried a walking stick and appeared very energetic. In the Leguzhai antique shop, No. 153 Yuyuan Road, west of the Huanlong Bridge, owned by Ningbo native Wang Jisheng, he spent five silver dollars to purchase a Qinghua (blue and white) porcelain bowl and basin, both made in the ancient kiln of the Ming Dynasty. Upon learning of this, Liu Yunfang, the chief of the Yimiao (City Temple) police station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, immediately led inspector Hu Qiuqiao and eight police officers to provide protection. Chairman Lin left by car at 8:45 AM.</p>
<h3>Visiting an Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>After leaving the City Temple, Chairman Lin drove directly to the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road. He first went to the third floor to view Ms. Chen Sixuan's painting exhibition. He browsed through the first and second rooms, expressing great appreciation for the exhibited paintings. He inscribed the four characters "Cang Shi Xiu Yi" (meaning ancient, solid, refined, and elegant) on the guest book and purchased a framed colored painting of chrysanthemums and rocks. Ms. Chen's displayed artworks were ancient and refined, and her Qinglü (blue and green) and Qianjiang (light red) paintings were exquisitely done. Her other floral paintings were also exceptionally lifelike and could be called meticulously crafted works.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin then went to the second floor to visit the China National Products Company. Accompanied by Shen Jinghui, the business director of the company, the chairman toured the various departments. The chairman deeply praised the arrangement of the products. A photograph was taken to commemorate the occasion (see picture). The chairman's attire was simple and dignified, truly a role model for the nation. The company's staff and customers initially did not know he was the Chairman of the National Government. After inquiring, they learned his identity and expressed their utmost admiration.</p>
<h3>Taking a Steamer to Ningbo</h3>
<p>The chairman returned to his residence for lunch. At 5 PM in the afternoon, he boarded the company's Ningxing steamer and departed from Shanghai for Ningbo. Few people went to the wharf to see him off, as the ship set sail at 5 PM, and Mr. Lin had arrived at the Sanbei Steamship Company wharf at the 16th Pier by car as early as 3:30 PM in the afternoon. Therefore, few outsiders knew about it, and those who knew did not expect Mr. Lin to board the ship so early. Only Guan Gong, the chief of the Wai Ma Lu First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led more than twenty armed police officers to provide protection at the wharf, along with Yu Qiaqing, the general manager of the Sanbei Company. Mr. Yu even offered his own large cabin to Mr. Lin for the journey. It is said that this trip of Mr. Lin's was entirely for sightseeing purposes and involved no official duties. He will stay in Ningbo for a day or two before returning to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Mr. He's Admonition</h3>
<p>After the inspection, Mr. He delivered an admonitory speech, saying: "Respected officials, respected comrades, I am very pleased to come here today to inspect and see that everyone's drills are proficient and your spirit is high. Under the leadership of Mayor Wu and Director Yang, you are responsible for maintaining the security of the entire city of Shanghai. This responsibility is as important as that borne by soldiers. Since you have undertaken such an important responsibility, you should keep the following three things firmly in mind at all times and strive to implement them earnestly. First, be loyal to your duties. The responsibility for ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the millions of citizens of Shanghai has been entrusted to you by the nation. As the name implies, you should do your best in all matters related to the safety of the lives and property of millions of citizens. There is no need to wait for the supervision of superiors, nor is there a need to wait for the demands of citizens. As long as it is a matter within your responsibility, you should work sincerely and earnestly. If you can continue to make such efforts, the prosperity of Shanghai and the safety of its residents can be adequately guaranteed. Second, obey orders and strictly observe discipline. This is the only natural duty of the military and police. The orders of the army commander must be carried out down to the brigade commander and regimental commander, and the orders of the brigade commander and regimental commander must be carried out down to the battalion, company, platoon, and squad leaders. Only then, at any time, will there be no problems of uneven steps or disordered actions. The security team should also be like the army, and the word 'obedience' must be truly practiced in order to achieve its mission. As for the necessity of observing discipline, it is an important turning point in the life and death of the military and police. A disciplined army will surely gain the support of the people, and a disciplined gendarmerie will surely gain the love of the people. Since you have received very strict training, you must already have a deep understanding of these two points. I am raising them today only to hope that everyone will pay extra attention. Third, cooperate effectively with the people. 'The military and police are the armed forces of the people, and the military and police must cooperate effectively with the people.' These two sentences are often heard in our society. As the name implies, your relationship with the people is particularly close, and you should cooperate effectively with the people. Only in this way can the people have a close relationship with us. We are the vanguard of the people, and the people are our rearguard. The two are mutually dependent and cannot be separated. Only then can the responsibility of maintaining law and order be easily completed. There are still many things I want to say today, but because of time constraints, I can only offer these important points to you. I hope that everyone will work harder from now on, strive forward, support the National Government, and consolidate the country. We must start with our own efforts. Only our own efforts are reliable and the way to self-reliance and self-existence."</p>
<h3>Wu and Yang's Responses</h3>
<p>After Mr. He delivered his speech, Mayor Wu and Director Yang successively delivered their responses. Mr. Wu said, "The points mentioned in Minister He's speech today are all basic conditions for soldiers. If all soldiers can do this, they can be said to have fulfilled their responsibilities. I hope that all officers and soldiers can make efforts to act in accordance with the points mentioned by Minister He, so as to fulfill the natural duty of soldiers to be loyal to the country." Mr. Yang replied, "Today, the security team invited Minister He to inspect, which has two meanings: (1) We must recognize the greatness of Minister He, because Minister He has made extraordinary contributions in the revolutionary process; (2) We ask Minister He to lead us, so that we can follow. Today, we are grateful for Minister He's practical instructions. All our officers and soldiers should express our gratitude to Minister He," and so on. After Mr. Yang finished his reply, the inspection ceremony was immediately completed.</p>
<h3>Czech Independence Day Today</h3>
<p>Czech expatriates hold grand celebrations</p>
<p>Today is Czech Independence Day, and Czech officials and businessmen stationed in Shanghai are holding celebrations as usual, happily and joyfully, which is bound to be lively. The Czech Republic's fame in the Far East began during the European War. At that time, the Czech Republic was revived and a republic was established. The Czech expatriate army, which fought in Siberia, then occupied the Siberian Railway to return home. They finally abandoned the land route at Vladivostok and returned by waterway. The Czech expatriate army was composed of Czechs and Slovaks among Austrian prisoners in Russia, who fought on the Russian front and in French and Italian territories to seek Czech independence. According to Czech state building, far from the Middle Ages, in European political life, very famous. At that time, the country name was Bohemia, with Prague as its capital, and also as the center of European politics. This was the golden age of the Czech Republic. The religious reform in history originated in Bohemia. The Czechs bravely resisted the Catholic crusaders in order to fight for religious freedom. At that time, the whole of Europe's thoughts were all based on Prague. Until today, countless ancient buildings still stand majestically, which is sufficient to show the clear sign of its glorious era in the past.</p>
<h3>Dr. Masaryk, President of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>In 1526, Ferdinand of the Habsburg dynasty claimed to be Emperor of Bohemia, and thus the glorious page in history came to an end. The Germanic dynasty tried its best to incorporate the Bohemian kingdom into its territory. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Czechs revolted to resist, but unfortunately failed, and the country was subjugated. However, the ambition for independence was never forgotten. In the mid-19th century, the Czech nation was shaken by the European political tide, and its ambition was latent and ready to act. Just as the European War broke out, God gave it the opportunity, so it openly resisted the Habsburg dynasty and was hostile to Austria-Hungary. At that time, its political leaders, Professor Masaryk and Dr. Benes, fled overseas to engage in the struggle for the liberation of the Czech nation. Czech generals and soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian army on various fronts mostly defected to the Allied forces. Before long, they became independent teams and fought alongside the Allied forces in France, Italy, and Russia, and their achievements were outstanding. On October 28, 1918, the establishment of the Czech Republic was announced in Prague, and the foreign race had been subjugated for three hundred years. To this end, they finally restored their freedom and independence, and the joy of the people can be imagined. Therefore, every day is a national holiday to celebrate. The Czech new state has only been established for more than ten years, and thanks to cautious diplomacy, clear internal affairs, and stable economy, it has been able to secure the peace of the rock in the middle of the powerful countries of Central Europe. Although the Czech Republic is surrounded by dictatorships in this extremely dark era, it still faithfully adheres to the system of civil government and the National Assembly, and its policies are characterized by stability. Since the founding of the country, Professor Masaryk has served as the head of state, and no one has changed. Mr. Ma is a pioneer among world politicians, and his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Benes, has also been in power since 1918, and his talents are outstanding in the negotiation arena. The sole purpose of his foreign policy is to maintain peace in Central Europe, continue the cooperation of European countries in the League of Nations, and unite Yugoslavia and Romania to form a small covenant, which has contributed a lot to maintaining peace in Central Europe in the past ten years. Recently, Greece and Turkey were encouraged to join and expanded into the Balkan Pact, in order to maintain peace in Southeast Europe. The peace policy pursued by the small covenant countries echoes that of France. This year, it is cooperating with Soviet Russia, because Soviet Russia is now having something to do in the Far East, so the guarantee of peace in Europe is also very important.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Czech Republic, it has made great progress in society, culture, and economy. The land of Bohemia, formerly under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was already prosperous. Czech goods, with the Austrian insignia, were exported to all over the world, and were famous for their exquisite quality. Today, the commercial goods with the words "Made in Czechoslovakia" are often welcomed by the public, because the materials are carefully selected, and their engineers and craftsmen are good at what they do. Czech products are famous all over the world, including glass, porcelain, textiles, ironware, leather, boots and shoes, machinery, and hardware, and its agricultural products such as sugar and malt are also special products. Czech exports are of good quality, and the country's reputation is spread around the world with the arrival of commercial goods. The number of foreign visitors is increasing year by year, because there are many hot springs in the territory. Those who soak in them can cure diseases and strengthen their bodies. Before the European War, European monarchs often visited, and King Edward VII of England especially went there several times. This year, many Indian princes, as well as the King and Queen of Siam, have come. In recent years, economic disasters, such as raging tides, have broken out and affected the whole world, and the Czech Republic has certainly suffered a lot. Its exports have been sharply reduced, but this young country in Central Europe has made every effort to reduce national expenses, so it has been able to weather the difficulties safely, so it has not caused serious political repercussions, like its neighbors. This also depends on the Czech people's profound achievements in culture and society, and they know that the disasters that make the world's economic institutions move cannot be remedied only by changing the political system. Only by working diligently, sacrificing generously, and striving to adapt to the new environment can we be able to do it. Today, the Czech Republic cannot boast of an amazing move, but as the ancient saying goes, "Those who speak less are beautiful in quality," and so is the founding of a country.</p>

<h3>Cigarette Factory Association Resolutely Opposes Guangdong Province's Re-imposition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association has repeatedly received reports from fellow businesses and members in Guangdong Province that Guangdong Province is monopolizing business by controlling cigarettes and re-levying additional taxes, destroying unified tax regulations. The association has repeatedly sent letters and telegrams, but has not been approved, and on the 24th of this month, it promulgated control regulations, requiring all tobacco merchants to register and acknowledge within three days, otherwise their sales rights in Guangdong will be revoked. In view of this situation, members of both the Guangdong and Shanghai associations find it difficult to cope. Therefore, a business committee meeting was convened yesterday to devise passive resistance in order to gain the understanding of the authorities. The resolutions and a letter from the Hangzhou Cigarette Industry Association are recorded below. To the esteemed readers, having read the report that the Guangdong government has started cigarette control on the 22nd of this month, monopolizing prices and restricting sales quotas, using the name of construction to carry out violent taxation, violating the principles of unified taxation, and disrupting national law, 2. It not only damages the government's prestige but also places tobacco merchants in a dead end. Moreover, disasters are now widespread throughout the country, and the treasury funds of various provinces are exhausted. If they follow suit, the impact will be unimaginable. We should ask your association to maintain its unyielding spirit and continue its opposition to curb the violent extortion of the local officials and save the tobacco merchants from difficulties. Our colleagues are in the same boat and dare to be the rearguard. This special letter is presented for your consideration, and we ask that you keep us informed of the handling of this case at any time. Furthermore, the decision (1) Before the Cantonese regime and additional measures are canceled, please ask the tax office to stop issuing licenses for cigarettes destined to Guangdong as an effective response. If any Chinese or foreign tobacco factory privately transports cigarettes to Guangdong from other ports and it is confirmed by colleagues to be detrimental to their business, the tax office should be requested to suspend the issuance of transportation licenses for the factory's cigarettes, whether they are transported to unified tax areas or non-unified tax areas, in order to avoid harming the business of their colleagues. (2) Starting from October 27th, for all Shanghai-shipped cigarettes to Guangdong, whose additional tax is paid to the Guangdong Control Committee, the unified tax will be reviewed separately by the Association. If it is found that the control was promoted by the company that is willing to pay the additional tax, the Tax Office should not refund the cigarette unified tax.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Fellow Association Requests Sichuan to be Listed as a Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Letter to the Drought Relief Association</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai, due to the disaster situation in Sichuan being no less than that in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, has specially written to the Drought Relief Association, requesting that it be included in the relief area. The original letter is as follows: To the esteemed readers, we are pleased to learn of the establishment of your association, which is a great relief. Hundreds of millions of disaster victims are fortunate to have a savior. In Sichuan this year, spring, summer, and autumn have all suffered from untimely rainfall, causing severe damage to crops, and have also suffered from floods and severe droughts, disaster upon disaster, resulting in a very serious disaster situation. Our association has repeatedly received reports from home letters that the disaster area has reached dozens of counties. The Sichuan provincial government has also telegraphed the central government to report the disaster situation, which is on record. The severity of the Sichuan disaster is no less than that of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. We have recently seen that the areas your association plans to provide relief to do not include Sichuan Province. We assume that you are unaware of the disaster situation in Sichuan, so we have sent this special letter, respectfully requesting that you treat everyone equally and include Sichuan as a relief area, which would be greatly appreciated. Tens of millions of disaster victims will praise your virtue together. The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Fu Xiao'an Will Inspect the North</h3>
<p>Regarding the Establishment of Branch Offices for the Bank of Communications</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications of China was founded in the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty, and has now been in existence for thirty-eight years. It was the pioneer in the establishment of banks by Chinese people. Tracing back to the time of its initial establishment, the bank set up branch offices in the capitals of various provinces and in various treaty ports, and its business flourished greatly, and it was once very prosperous. Later, due to the Boxer Rebellion and the turbulent situation, it gradually closed down its branch offices in other ports one after another. In recent years, in addition to establishing branch offices in Nanjing, Hankou, Xiamen, Suzhou, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Dinghai, Nantong, Daishan, and other places, it still lacks presence in the northern provinces. The bank's shareholders, especially those who are from the north, as well as people from all walks of life in Pingjin and Qingji, all believe that the banking business in the north is now booming, and that the bank, being the earliest bank established in the country, should assess the situation and immediately establish branch offices. They have sent letters to the bank's board of directors, requesting that branch offices be established in major cities in the north as soon as possible to regulate social finance and facilitate the public. The board of directors has fully adopted this proposal and has publicly elected Chairman Fu Xiao'an to go to Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other major cities to first conduct an on-site inspection of the social situation and commercial conditions. It is heard that Mr. Fu is currently arranging everything and will soon depart for the north.</p>

<h3>Hamsden's Grand Circus Performs Amazing Feats Today</h3>
<p>At the West End of the Great World</p>
<p>The British Hamsden Grand Circus, after arriving in Shanghai in full force the day before yesterday, has chosen the west end of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII and will start performing today. The program includes a Burmese-trained parrot show, divine horse skills, motorcycle long jump, beauty on horseback, and monkey racing, among other thrilling and daring skills that are rare in the world and were not featured in the previous Haijingbo Circus. There are many other amazing programs that will be performed in sequence every day. However, in the past, ticket prices were expensive, and many ordinary people were deterred by the high prices. Now, in order to treat customers favorably, Southern Motors is reducing seat prices at the cost of great sacrifice, with prices of only 30 cents, 60 cents, 1.20 yuan, and 2 yuan. A full private box costs only 10 yuan, which can be said to be a good opportunity for popular entertainment. One can imagine that Avenue Edward VII will be bustling today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Qingpu New Village Plan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Qingpu New Village at the end of the Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai and the Shanghai-Qingpu Road was initiated by Cao Sanjue and other returned overseas Chinese. Twenty thousand yuan of capital has been raised, and the investors were invited to the Youth Association the night before last to report on the preparations and plan the village as follows: (1) Purchase 60 mu of land. 40 mu have already been purchased for 80,000 yuan, approximately 2,000 yuan per mu. After the full amount has been purchased, village roads, small parks, and sports fields will be built. After deducting the land occupied above, there will be approximately 50 mu left, which will be divided into 50 plots to build 50 small Western-style houses. (2) All kinds of construction, the place is close to the market town and the road is already open to traffic, so schools, vegetable fields, parks, and golf courses, security teams, etc. have been established. When the new payment is established, telephones and electricity will be connected from Shanghai, and a bus company will be negotiated to add stations. It takes about 18 minutes from the new village to the concession. The water problem will be solved by self-drilling artesian wells. It is planned to continue to collect investors and start construction next year.</p>
<h3>Major Construction on the West Sports Club Road</h3>
<p>The West Sports Club Road is quiet and picturesque, known in Shanghai. Since the Shanghai Municipal Government built the city center, the East and West Sports Club Roads have become the thoroughfare between the concession and the municipal government. The traffic is heavy and convenient. The general residents regard it as the most suitable virgin land to live in. Financiers and investors have invested and built houses in accordance with the requirements of residents to solve the housing problem for the general public. Recently, major construction is underway in the West Sports Club Road area. The new buildings with painted beams and carved pillars can be seen from afar. The Xinhua No. 1 Village under construction is the largest in scale. The electric poles have been erected one after another. Small schools are being planned and cooperative shops will also be opened. It is expected that the entire project will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting the Bureau of Public Works to Improve Waste Disposal</h3>
<p>Citizens' 37th District Branch</p>
<p>Letter to the Taxpayers Association for Forwarding</p>
<p>The Citizens' 37th District Branch of North Fujian Road is located near a manure truck wharf. The manure trucks come and go, often not stopping until noon, and leaving spills all over the ground, which is unbearable. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Chinese Taxpayers Association, requesting the Bureau of Public Works to improve the situation. The original letter is recorded below: To the esteemed readers, according to repeated statements from the majority of the members of our association, the manure dumping on this road does not always follow the time stipulated by the Bureau of Public Works Sanitation Department, often extending until near noon, and the manure trucks are damaged and leaking, resulting in manure all over the ground, which is harmful to public health and greatly affects the business on this road. We should ask your association to send a letter to the Sanitation Department of the Bureau of Public Works, requesting it to quickly reform the situation. According to this, this road is located near the manure truck wharf, so it is impossible to prevent their coming and going. However, the manure dumping time is extended until near noon, which violates the regulations of the Bureau of Public Works Sanitation Department. Furthermore, the manure trucks are damaged and leaking, causing waste on the road, causing pedestrians to swallow their voices and avoid them. As a result, the business of the shops on this road has been greatly affected. This situation not only hinders public health but also damages the reputation of the Bureau of Public Works Sanitation Department. We should ask your association to forward this letter to the Bureau of Public Works Sanitation Department, requesting it to quickly order its subordinates to urge the manure collectors to ensure that manure is not dumped after 9:00 AM and to improve the old manure trucks to avoid manure leakage and to promote public health, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Fire at Jiangnan Shipyard Yesterday, Wang Dasheng's Workshop Burnt Down</h3>
<p>The Pumping Room of the New Dock Was Slightly Affected</p>
<p>The Fire Truck Suddenly Sank in the Sand and Mud</p>
<p>The pumping room of the No. 3 New Dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard suddenly caught fire at about 1 PM yesterday. Fire brigades from all sections sent vehicles to rescue. The workshop of Wang Dasheng, the construction contractor, was completely burned down, and the pumping room was also affected. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Building a New House</h3>
<p>After the completion of the first phase of the new No. 3 dock of the shipyard, there is a water pump installed on its west side. Now a new house is being built to house the machine, which is being contracted by Wang Dasheng Construction Company. It has been gradually completed. In order to facilitate the work, the construction company has built a temporary workshop on the west side of the house.</p>
<h3>Sudden Fire</h3>
<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday, the workers were using fire to connect the lead sheets on the roof of the pumping room. For some unknown reason, sparks fell on the wooden planks below the workshop. Once it caught fire, it immediately spread. In a short time, the flames soared, and the workshop had already broken through the roof. Because the workshop was built entirely of wood, it was completely burned down.</p>
<h3>Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>When the fire broke out, the shipyard staff immediately notified the fire brigades of each section by telephone. At the same time, the guards of the shipyard not only dispatched soldiers to maintain order at the fire scene, but also took out all the pumps with the help of all the guards to assist in the rescue. The fire trucks of the fire brigades from each section also arrived one after another and tried their best to rescue. The fire was put out at about 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Loss Statistics</h3>
<p>After investigation, in addition to the complete burning down of the construction company's workshop, the western roof, windows, and walls of the pumping room were also slightly affected. Fortunately, the new dock water pump worth more than 100,000 yuan inside the house was not affected at all. According to the construction foreman, the estimated loss this time is about 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fire Truck Sinks</h3>
<p>When the fire broke out, five or six fire trucks from various fire brigades arrived at the scene. One of the fire trucks from the South District was parked near the new dock, by the Huangpu River. Because the mud there was extremely loose, when the water was pumped for rescue, the body of the truck shook, causing it to sink. The front and rear wheels were all trapped in the sand and mud and could not move. Fortunately, there was a crane next to the shipyard, so the crane was used to lift the fire truck and place it on the ground, so it could drive out on its own.</p>
<h3>Ocean Rice from Guangdong to Shanghai Resembles Japanese Rice in Color</h3>
<p>A Total of More Than 2,000 Bags Are Sold by Guangdong Merchants</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Is Suspicious and Is Now Investigating</p>
<p>Suddenly, more than 2,580 bags of ocean rice transshipped from Guangdong were transported to Shanghai by the Shandong and Yushun ships the other day. Yesterday, samples were sold in the market. The sellers were rice merchants from Guangdong stationed in Shanghai. The color and rice quality resembled Japanese Taiwanese ocean rice. The rice industry is paying close attention. A reporter from Dagong News Agency inquired about the details from all parties yesterday, and recorded them as follows:</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Sells Rice Shipped to Shanghai the Other Day</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, due to the drought and damage to agricultural products, the price of rice has risen continuously due to the lack of transportation sources. At the same time, rice merchants have ordered more than one million bags of ocean rice from Saigon and Siam to regulate food for the people, causing criticism from all walks of life. Unexpectedly, the other day (the 26th), the first batch of ocean rice transshipped from Guangdong, more than 1,580 bags, was loaded and transported to Shanghai by the Taikoo Shipping Company's Shandong ship and the China Merchants Bureau's Yushun ship. The sellers are four or five Guangdong rice shops stationed in the north and south markets in Shanghai, and Guangdong rice brokers sell samples. The opening price for the first-class rice is 10 yuan and 6 cents, and the opening price for the second-class rice is 10 yuan and 5 cents. The ocean rice is now being unloaded and stored.</p>
<h3>Rice Samples Resemble Japanese Rice in Color</h3>
<p>The ocean rice transshipped from Guangdong to Shanghai is long and mixed in grains and coarse white in color, which is completely similar to the rice produced in Taiwan, Japan. There was a lot of discussion in the rice market yesterday, and it was believed that Guangdong has a temperate climate and has no rice production. The people's food relies entirely on supplies from other provinces and ocean rice. There has never been surplus rice for transshipment. Now, the first batch of ocean rice, more than 2,500 bags, has suddenly been transported. According to the rice sample research, it is indeed Taiwanese rice. Because the customs in Guangdong and other places have not yet levied import tariffs on rice, rice merchants buy ocean brown rice for speculative purposes, and then whiten it in Guangdong to avoid public attention. One package can be purchased for three yuan. Now the rice industry group is conducting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Ocean Rice are Transported and Sold Inland</h3>
<p>A Chinese merchant, Mr. Feng, ordered more than 100,000 yuan worth of ocean rice from Saigon, and the first batch of 37,455 bags transported to Shanghai by the Norwegian merchant ship Leijiniev arrived. The Dagong News Agency reporter inquired from the rice industry and learned that the ocean rice did arrive in Shanghai. Mr. Feng is a representative of the money industry. However, this batch of ocean rice has been in Shanghai for many days, but it has not been seen on the market. According to the situation in the Shanghai rice market, the price of rice is still fluctuating and there is no certainty for promotion. Part of it has now been transported to the inland for sale.</p>
<h3>Elephant Shell Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Association Mediation</p>
<p>Signing a Settlement Agreement</p>
<p>The city's medical community and Dongjiang Fritillaria Cooperation have been at odds for a long time over the issue of elephant shells. The other day, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Zhongzhi, and Fang Jiaobo of the Ningbo Fellow Association convened various related groups to hold a meeting for mediation, and invited Yingbin Secretary of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province to attend. The general situation has been recorded in previous reports. The mediation meeting on that day started at 2:00 PM and did not end until 11:00 PM. The Chinese medicine industry had many disputes with the cooperative and the Ningbo pharmacies. The representatives of the Chinese medicine industry repeatedly contested the conditions and stated that they were entrusted by their colleagues and could not arbitrarily take the painful steps of retreat. After repeated consultations by Yu Fang and others, and promising to explain the meeting to the Chinese medicine industry at any time, the conditions were finally agreed upon, a settlement agreement was signed, and it was decided that the Shanghai Chinese Medicine and Pharmaceutical Association, together with the Fritillaria Cooperation and the Ningbo four pharmacies, would publish the results of the mediation in the newspaper. The resolutions of the Chinese medical community's alternative medicines and the Chinese pharmaceutical community's failure to prepare elephant shells were all cancelled from the date of publication in the newspaper. The elephant shell problem, which has been in dispute for several months, can now be satisfactorily resolved, which is also good news for the medical community in the city. The content of the conditions are: (1) The price increase of the second sale by the pharmacy should be cancelled, and the original contract price for the first new contract this year (i.e., the first sale) should be restored from the date of establishment of this contract to show fairness. The goods that the pharmacies in Ningbo have already sold to various ports will still be fulfilled according to the original purchase price. The samples of Yuanbaobei and Zhubei should be marked first for future delivery standards (1) Regarding the industry's production and sales cooperation and how the cooperative's manufacturing, planting and permanent fundamental stability methods should be improved, all parties will be called together within one month from now to discuss the matter in detail and decide on a time for implementation. (1) This settlement will be signed and kept in the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai for record. The Fellow Association will make four copies and distribute them to all parties, each holding one copy for record, and all parties will jointly publish the settlement in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Huji University Female Student's Tragic Death Case</h3>
<p>Private Prosecution Part Has Been Reconciled</p>
<p>Public Prosecution Scheduled for Sentencing on the 31st</p>
<p>The case of Wu Yongmei, a female student at the Jinan University in Zhenru, who was hit and killed by a car driven by Lan Fuming, has been publicly tried by the Criminal Court of the District Court without a conclusion. Lan paid 5,000 yuan as bail to be released pending a decision. The details have been reported previously. It is now learned that this case was resumed in the Fifth Tribunal by Judge Zhang Shao at 3:00 PM yesterday. On the plaintiff's side, Ouyang Shu and Hua Shuxian, and the private prosecution's attorney Su Xingnan, arrived, while the defendant Lan Fuming, along with his attorneys Wang Zaoshi and Lan Ren, arrived in court. After the judge ascended the bench, he first asked Lan Fuming whether the private prosecution had been reconciled outside the court. Attorney Wang Zaoshi said, "The private prosecution issue has been discussed with the plaintiff's attorney." The official said to Ouyang Shu and Hua Shuxian, "Are you willing to reconcile outside the court?" Ouyang and others replied, "Yes, we have already agreed." So, the private prosecution attorney Su left the court first. The official then invited Prosecutor Zhang Zi to the court to make a statement, and then began the debate. Attorneys Wang and Lan rose and defended the defendant for a long time. As a result, it was considered the conclusion and scheduled to be sentenced at 10:00 AM on the 31st of this month. The defendant still paid the original bail.</p>
<h3>The International and Franco-Chinese Savings Societies Request Deferral of Security Deposits</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Replies Disapproving of Concessions</p>
<p>Since the central government promulgated the Savings Bank Law, all savings banks must deposit a quarter of their total savings deposits with the Central Bank as security, in accordance with Article 9 of the law. The Chinese savings banks in this city have complied with the regulations and made deposits. The Ministry of Finance has also organized a Savings Bank Deposit Security Reserve Committee to implement the matter. Foreign merchants in China who operate savings accounts must also comply with the regulations. Therefore, the International Savings Society and the Franco-Chinese Savings Society, etc., must pay. Later, Committee Member Simen of the International Savings Society sent a letter to the Savings Bank Deposit Security Reserve Committee, stating that the payment of the security reserve must wait until the board of directors meeting next month (November) before it can be decided, and requested not to be included in the legal banking group. The standing committee member of the Association, Ye Zhuotang, reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Association, stating that it must still be handled in accordance with the law and no concessions would be allowed. Therefore, the Association has also sent a special letter notifying the International and Franco-Chinese Savings Societies to comply.</p>
<h3>時代日報 Damaging Xiang Kangyuan</h3>
<p>The police have filed a public prosecution against Lai Lansheng</p>
<p>Lai says he has apologized and reconciled</p>
<p>The "Shidai Ribao" (Times Daily) tabloid, located at No. 221 Baige Road, Shanghai, is run by Lai Lansheng. On the seventh of this month, the newspaper published an article titled "The Real Reason for Xiang Kangyuan's Failure." The article stated that Xiang Kangyuan's Kangyuan Can Factory was dealing in Japanese goods, and that Mr. Xiang had engaged in speculation, losing over one million yuan, leading to the factory's closure. Xiang Kangyuan, upon seeing the report, found it to be entirely baseless, as the factory was thriving. Since the publication of the news, the Kangyuan factory had suffered immense damage. He immediately reported the matter to the Xinzha police station for investigation and invited representatives from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to inspect the factory. Following the investigation by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, it was determined that all the points reported by the "Shidai Ribao" were untrue. The Chamber of Commerce issued a certificate to that effect. The Xinzha police station, through detective Li Shizhong, also confirmed that "Shidai Ribao" had deliberately damaged Xiang Kangyuan's reputation and credit. The case was then reported to the Legal Department of the Public Works Bureau, and Qian Xun, a lawyer from the department, filed a public prosecution under Article 330 of the Criminal Law, which deals with crimes of damaging a person's reputation and credit. Deng Baosun, a judge of the First Special Court, summoned Lai Lansheng yesterday morning. After hearing the case presented by lawyer Qian, the court was requested to handle it according to the law. Lai Lansheng stated that the article was submitted from an outside source, and he was occupied with other matters at the time and did not personally review it. After its publication, he negotiated a reconciliation with Mr. Xiang Kangyuan through the introduction of lawyer Xue Dubi. The newspaper published a report on the Kangyuan factory's inspection to clarify the misunderstanding caused by the previous article and published large advertisements in major newspapers to apologize to the plaintiff. Therefore, he argued, the case had already been settled. However, Mr. Zhu, the representative of Xiang Kangyuan, denied that a reconciliation had been reached, stating that the publication of the apology advertisement was a unilateral action by the defendant. The court pointed out that the case was subject to prosecution based on a complaint, and Xiang Kangyuan's personal appearance was required to express whether he wanted to prosecute. The court adjourned the case until Xiang Kangyuan appeared in court for further verification.</p>
<h3>A Large-Scale Arrest of Prostitutes</h3>
<p>Over one hundred people at Qinglian Pavilion</p>
<p>Over thirty people at Xiamen Road</p>
<p>The Public Security Department of the Public Concession, recognizing the prevalence of clandestine prostitution within the concession, which greatly hinders traffic and security, issued a strict prohibition order, which was reported in this newspaper. Since the issuance of the prohibition order, the Lao Zha police station, due to the high concentration of prostitutes within its jurisdiction, immediately dispatched detectives Xue Zhiwen, Yao Jia Gui, Zhang Wenjun, and others to strictly enforce the law in shifts. In the month prior, they apprehended one to two thousand prostitutes. Furthermore, the Yueji Han Village within the jurisdiction of the Hongkou police station had the largest number of prostitutes than any other location in the area, however, through the strict enforcement of law by detective Zhu Mengwei and others, the area has gradually been cleaned up. Recently, detective Xue of the Lao Zha police station discovered that the Qinglian Pavilion teahouse located at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road was a gathering place for prostitutes. As the prostitutes had noticed that the police were arresting them on various roads, they started gathering at this teahouse. On the previous night around 9:00 PM, Mr. Xue, along with a large group of detectives, drove to the teahouse, surrounded it, and then went upstairs to arrest the prostitutes one by one. They arrested one hundred and thirty prostitutes, transported them in six large cars back to the police station, and placed them in custody. Subsequently, detectives Xue and Yao, upon receiving a search warrant from the First Special Court, arrested over thirty prostitutes at No. 7, Rongshou Lane, Xiamen Road. Yesterday morning, they were all escorted to the Ninth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where Judge Shen Shanzeng severely punished them separately.</p>

<h3>The China National Products Sales Company Organizes a Joint Market for Various Factories</h3>
<p>The entire second floor is provided free of charge</p>
<p>Opening is scheduled for November 11th</p>
<p>The China National Products Sales Joint Company was established by prominent industrialists such as Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yu Qiaqing, and Wu Zhihao. Since its establishment, the company has been actively promoting the establishment of national product companies in various regions, advocating foreign trade, assisting production, and encouraging industry, sparing no effort. Previously, the company's original office address at No. 500 Henan Road was insufficient for its needs, and on the 12th of this month, it moved to No. 261 Nanjing Road. Currently, to promote domestic products and concentrate the strengths of various factories to jointly advance, the company has specially allocated the entire second floor and part of the ground floor to assemble thirty local factories known for their excellent products and reputation to organize a joint market. This market is provided free of charge, without rent, to demonstrate the company's determination to promote domestic products. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a joint meeting of domestic product manufacturers was held in the company's conference room to jointly discuss the implementation process. Attendees included Chu Yidong of Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Zhou Wenyuan of Wuzhou Pharmacy, Gao Shen of Yixin Factory, Cai Hanzhang of Guanshengyuan, Zheng Hairuo of Lihua Hosiery Factory, Ding Hongchuan of Zhenhua Pottery Factory, Shen Riqiang of Xinxin Factory, He Miao of Peacock Collar Company, Bi Zaichang of Zeng Kang Silk Scarf Shop, representatives from East Asia Woolen Textile Company, Gan Dounan of Lixing Thermos Factory, Zhang Jingyao of Guanyi, Chen Xin of Yifeng, Shen Peilin of Family Industrial Society, Xu Wenzhao of Jinglun Shirt and Socks Factory, Zhou Songshou of Yonghe Industrial Company, Feng Shijie of Jingxin Handkerchief Factory, Hu Yongtang of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, Qiu Xingchi of Huali Time, Shi Chunshan of Zhendan Lieban, Sun Daosheng of Dongmei Tobacco Company, Xu Zhichao of Tongxing Industrial Society, Yang Huannan of Fuhua Company, Zheng Dongshan of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Wu Zhihao and Zhu Dechao of China National Products Sales Joint Company. Chairman Wu Zhihao first reported the significance of the meeting. (The long speech is omitted.) The following resolutions were then made: (1) The market was named the "Joint Market of Thirty National Product Factories." (2) A committee consisting of the thirty manufacturers was formed, and Zhu Dechao, Sun Daosheng, Shen Peilin, Xu Wenzhao, and Gan Dounan were appointed to draft the regulations, to be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. (3) The opening was set for November 11th, and the closing for December 12th. (4) Each factory would be responsible for its own display and sales. (5) Ding Hongchuan, Chen Xin, and Gao Shengkang were responsible for the solicitation group, and Sun Cailiang, Li Heling, and Zhang Jingquan were responsible for the review group. It was reported that Ningbo Industrial Bank, to support production, would offer national product revolving loans to all manufacturers participating in the joint market organized by the sales company, to assist with the promotion of national products. The China National Products Sales Joint Company issued this announcement on October 27th.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech on the Construction of the City Center Area</h3>
<p>The United Pacific Association held its October dinner meeting yesterday in the city center area. Mayor Wu said in his speech, "Today, the United Pacific Association's October meeting is held at the city center government building. The city government considers this a great honor. Everyone present today is a leader in all circles of Shanghai, so today I would like to discuss with you 'The Construction of the City Center Area,' which I believe you will be happy to hear about." Shanghai originated from Shanghai County, which was established in the 27th year of the Yuan Dynasty (i.e., 1290 AD). Today's Nanshi in Shanghai is the birthplace of Shanghai. The population at that time, and lacking accurate research and statistics, however, according to historical records, in the tenth year of Daoguang (i.e., 1830 AD), the population of the entire Shanghai County was over 540,000. On November 17th of the 23rd year of Daoguang (i.e., 1843 AD), the Chinese government, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Nanjing, announced Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports. The Shanghai Public Concession was established in the 25th year of Daoguang (i.e., 1845 AD), and the French Concession was established in the 30th year of Daoguang (i.e., 1850 AD). At that time, the population of Shanghai County, which is now the Nanshi area, was only about 40,000 people. The population within the concessions was only three to four hundred people. The number of foreigners in the Public Concession was only over one hundred, and the number of foreigners in the French Concession was only twenty to thirty. At that time, not only was Shanghai County a traditional Chinese city, and most people relied on agriculture, fishing, and handicrafts for a living, but today's Public Concession and French Concession were also mostly agricultural areas and mudflats ninety years ago, merely appendages to Shanghai County. Reflecting on the desolate situation of that time, the lights were not even as numerous as the fishing lights in the Huangpu River, and all facilities were naturally extremely rudimentary. Who could have imagined that Shanghai would be so prosperous ninety years later? Now, Shanghai has a population of over 3.4 million, an increase of eighty times. Since the establishment of the Shanghai concessions, new knowledge from Europe and America has flowed in from Shanghai, and foreign residents in Shanghai have also planned and constructed Shanghai based on modern urban planning. The Shanghai concessions have now been established for ninety years. These ninety years can be considered a period of concession construction. Today, as we look back on history, Shanghai County was adhering to outdated methods and had no construction. Modern urban planning and implementation were lacking. Even in the construction of the concessions, general plans were not made with consideration for fifty or one hundred years in the future, so that various facilities and construction could not fully adapt to the needs of today's economic and social development. This is something that all people in Shanghai regret. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, with his great and extraordinary vision, carefully considered and looked far ahead, discovering the defects and crises in Shanghai's development. He personally drafted a "Greater Shanghai Plan" to save and develop Shanghai. Eight years ago, when the Shanghai Municipal Government was established, it began planning and preparing to gradually realize the Greater Shanghai Plan. Although Shanghai is one of the world's five largest cities, the increase in Shanghai's population is much faster than other major cities. In the past, the people living in Shanghai differed due to differences in nationality, political, economic, and social relations, and their interests were also inconsistent. As a result, construction was generally done for immediate needs, without considering the needs of fifty or one hundred years in the future, and focused on local interests rather than the interests of the general public. Therefore, our Greater Shanghai construction plan today seeks to avoid repeating these mistakes. All plans and facilities must strive to consider the current interests and needs of the general public, while also striving to adapt to Shanghai's future prosperity and development. The construction of the city center area is part of the Greater Shanghai construction plan and the beginning of Greater Shanghai construction. The city center area covers an area of over 5,400 mu, equivalent to 830 acres and 3.3 square kilometers. It is planned as the location of the city's highest administrative organs, and in the future, various public and important institutions will be gradually relocated here. The Shanghai Municipal Government chose this area as the city center area because it not only has a vast area but also borders the Huangpu River and is adjacent to Wusong, Jiangwan, the Public Concession, Zhabei, and other areas. There is also a railway that connects them. In addition to the above conditions, there is another important condition, which is the Qiujiang Wharf. The Qiujiang Wharf is the deepest water point in Shanghai. Once constructed, it will become Shanghai's only excellent wharf. Not only that, but the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway will also be extended to the Qiujiang Wharf. In this way, water and land transportation will be connected, and future development is expected. At the same time, there will also be a wharf set up in Wusong, with crane equipment and other facilities. Therefore, the city center area will not only be the center of municipal construction but also the hub of water and land transportation, connecting sea transportation to land transportation and reaching the Chinese interior. As for the progress of the construction in the city center area, all public utility facilities in the city center area are gradually being completed. In terms of private investment, in addition to land purchases, many residences and new buildings have been constructed. The Municipal Government is now actively working on the design and construction of all public facilities in the city center area, such as public sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, museums, and libraries, which are all under construction. Other projects, such as the Municipal Central Hospital, are large in scale and can accommodate 200 beds. The Municipal City Center Area School, the vegetable market, and small-scale department stores will all begin construction this month. It is expected that the above-mentioned buildings will be completed successively around October of next year. As the Sixth National Games have been scheduled to be held at the new sports field in Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival next year, construction must be accelerated. The construction of the city center area will not only promote the revitalization of Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other war-torn areas, but also increase the prosperity of Shanghai. What is regrettable is that after the Shanghai war, the Municipal Government, with its limited financial resources, must strive for the aftermath and revitalization of the war-torn areas while also striving for the construction of the city center area, which inevitably leads to the difficulty of attending to one thing and losing another. Therefore, many constructions cannot be fully realized as expected and meet the expectations of the citizens. Your visit today is just a small accomplishment of the city government since it moved from the old city area to the city center area in January of this year. The above has briefly explained the past, present, and future of Shanghai. In short, the construction of Greater Shanghai is of great importance to the future prosperity of Shanghai and the lives of all people in the city. The difficulty of this task is well known to the people of Shanghai. It is hoped that all citizens will support and participate in the process so that the Municipal Government can fulfill its responsibilities and meet the greatest expectations of the citizens. The great construction capabilities inherent in our Chinese nation can also be restored and demonstrated in the construction of this world-renowned metropolis."</p>

<h3>Dr. Zhang Sumin's Lecture on the Silver Export Tax Problem</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Sumin, Head of the Banking Department of National Jinan University, lectured on the issue of silver export tax to colleagues at the Ning Shao Life Insurance Company Club the other day. He briefly stated that since the government implemented the silver export tax, many people from all walks of life have expressed their opinions. However, such issues are too specialized, and even experts' statements may cause misunderstandings if their wording is slightly careless. According to his personal view, it can be divided into four points: (1) The effect of the silver export tax is the same as prohibiting silver exports. The only difference is that it is superficially more peaceful and can avoid panic among merchants and civilians. (2) The purpose of the silver export tax is to prevent silver exports, but its effect is to suppress domestic silver prices. Lowering silver prices means lowering currency prices and raising commodity prices. This is a form of inflation. Some commentators do not realize this, while others support the silver export tax but oppose inflation at the same time, which is quite confusing. (3) The large number of silver exports from our country in recent months is not entirely due to the increase in the trade deficit. Even if the only reason is the trade deficit, reducing the trade deficit cannot be achieved by a meaningless slogan of "buying domestic goods." Reducing the trade deficit requires finding ways to promote domestic goods overseas. Imposing a silver export tax and reducing the value of the national currency is indeed a practical way to promote domestic goods. Other methods of promotion include improving quality and reducing costs. Merely hoping that customers will buy goods is an old-fashioned business method. Actively promoting goods is a modern business method. Therefore, we should advocate the slogan of "promoting domestic goods" to replace the slogan of "buying domestic goods." (4) The final effectiveness of the silver export tax depends on whether the government can prohibit the smuggling of silver exports. As for the foreign exchange stabilization fund, 100 million yuan is probably still too little. If foreign banks intend to disrupt the market, this amount can be easily exhausted.</p>
<h3>Shed Dwellers at Wuzhen Road Forced to Relocate, Social Bureau Mediates, Temporary Residence Permitted</h3>
<p>Shed dwellers express dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Yu Sihai has been released</p>
<p>The shed dwellers between Wuzhen Road, Xinmin Road, and Xinjiang Road in Zhabei, who previously opposed the forced relocation of houses by the landlord Yu Chang Company, had petitioned various party and government agencies. Now, the Social Bureau has convened both parties for mediation, and it was decided that if the landlord renovates the houses, all shed dwellers must relocate in February of next year. If the houses are not renovated, they can continue to live there. However, the shed dwellers still express opposition to this. Yu Sihai, a shed dweller who was previously accused of sending threatening letters, has been released by the Public Security Bureau after the Social Bureau investigated and found that the letters were sent under a false name. Currently, the shed dwellers are investigating the truth of the case and plan to ask the court to investigate.</p>
<h3>The 20th Anniversary of the Danyang Association</h3>

<h3>Injured Apprentice Dies from Injury at Taiyi Factory</h3>
<p>No way to investigate family members</p>
<p>Corpse handed over to the hall for collection</p>
<p>On August 19th of this year, at around 8:00 AM, a fire broke out at the Taiyi Wheat Flour Factory in Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, due to negligence. The fire spread and caused the building to collapse, resulting in the death of the factory owner Zhang Jingchu and several workers, as well as injuries to nearly 30 people, including male and female workers and passersby. The details were reported in previous newspapers. The families of all those who died and were injured simultaneously formed a committee to demand compensation for medical expenses and other expenses from the factory. It is now reported that these matters have been concluded and brought to an end. Unexpectedly, Song Acai, a boy of 14 years old who lived near the factory and was from Ningbo, was learning carpentry in Shanghai. He was passing by the factory on that day and was injured in the head. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After more than two months of treatment, he died from the deep wound to his brain on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, which dispatched a detective to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. It was impossible to investigate the deceased's family members, and the Taiyi factory refused to acknowledge responsibility for collecting the body and providing a coffin, stating that the deceased's family or teacher had not requested registration at the factory when he was injured. Yesterday, the police reported the matter to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the hall, and after examining the body and confirming that the deceased had died from injuries sustained in the collapse, ordered the corpse to be temporarily handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for temporary burial, pending identification by family members.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiheng, 18 years old, from Ningbo, was an apprentice at the Shenkang Hardware Store on Annam Road in the French Concession. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the store owner sent him to install glass at the residence of a certain family at No. 1182, the intersection of Jingan Temple Road and Seymour Road. He carelessly fell from the third floor, breaking his skull and bleeding profusely. He was found by detective No. 103, who sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died before reaching the hospital and was transferred to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>New Information on the Inaugural Voyage of the Hezhong Muyou Steamer</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Hezhong Wharf and Warehouse Company at Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi has been very successful in its business. Recently, it has expanded its navigation department and purchased a Muyou express steamer to operate the new Shanghai-Xiangshui port route. It is reported that Xiangshui port is a major export port for miscellaneous grains and products from Guanyun, Funing, and Lianshui counties. Since the launch of the steamer, the transportation of various exports from Xiangshui, such as wheat, mung beans, sesame seeds, soybeans, red sorghum, cotton, cottonseed, melon seeds, peanut kernels, and yellow rice, has become more convenient. As a result, Shanghai grain merchants are enthusiastically procuring goods from that area. It is reported that the company has collected various samples of products to allow Shanghai merchants to understand their qualities, and they are displayed in the navigation department on the third floor of the company. All are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Employee and Dancer Flee Together</h3>
<p>Defrauding 7,300 yuan</p>
<p>Shangguan Hougeng, also known as Chen Shaoying, from Haining, Zhejiang, was an employee of the Shen Da Transportation Company at Zhengjia Wood Bridge. He often went to dance halls to dance, which resulted in a illicit relationship with a dancer named Gao Xiaomei. However, Shangguan's monthly salary was very low, which was not enough for his lavish spending. On the fifth of this month, taking advantage of the fact that the company's accountant had taken leave and left him to act as accountant, he devised a plan to defraud the company of 7,300 yuan in cash and fled with the dancer Gao Xiaomei, disappearing without a trace. The company has now reported the case to the police and requested their arrest.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case Against Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Zhu Ziyun</h3>
<p>Zhu Ziyun, a traditional Chinese medicine throat and pediatric doctor from Jiangwan, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Cai Ziying from Yangzhou for medical malpractice resulting in death. Judge Wu Zehan has summoned him once, however, because the plaintiff's address was unknown, he was ordered to be served by public announcement, and the hearing was postponed to November 7th. Now, it is learned that after the opening of the court, Cai Ziying hired a lawyer to submit a statement to the Special Court stating his location. Judge Wu summoned Cai yesterday afternoon. According to Cai, he is from Yangzhou and resides at No. 41, Yishun Lane, Changming Road, Tokyo Road, which is difficult to find. Therefore, he requested that the documents be sent to his lawyer for delivery. He also stated the details of the lawsuit, claiming that his son, Shunbao, who was less than 30 months old, developed a fever in July. After recovering, he still had chills and fever, so he was introduced to the defendant Zhu Ziyun for treatment on July 16th. Unexpectedly, the medicine used by Dr. Zhu was all hot and spicy, such as aconite and cinnamon. After taking the medicine, Shunbao became extremely thirsty and even more feverish. Until 10</p>
<p>If not seen a slight improvement, but presented a dangerous situation. On the 26th, his condition became extremely dangerous, and Zhou Ziyu and others were called in for a consultation. They believed that it was caused by incorrect medication and prescribed a formula using rhino horn tips, antelope horn tips, and Zixue Dan to try to save his life. The medicine cost over 24.3 yuan. However, it did not save his life, and he died. Therefore, he submitted the prescription to the court. After reviewing the case, Judge Wu ordered that the hearing be postponed to November 7th.</p>
<h3>Li Sheng Chemical Factory's "Lux" Cream Being Counterfeited</h3>
<p>Li Sheng Chemical Industrial Factory, located at No. 6, Zilai Village, Xinqiao Street, Min'guo Road, produces LUX cream. Its quality is excellent, and its price is low. Since its introduction to the market, it has been warmly welcomed by ladies from all walks of life and is the most well-established skin cream among domestic products. Recently, some people have been counterfeiting and selling it to seek illicit profits. After the Public Security Bureau and the French Concession Police successively cracked down on these activities, the counterfeit criminals have been transferred to the court for legal punishment. To prevent consumers from mistakenly purchasing counterfeit products and to stop others from counterfeiting and selling them again, Mr. Wu Cairong, the factory manager, has specially commissioned Mr. Pan Xulun (accountant), Lawyer Bao Changdong, and Lawyer Yao Hongxi as representatives to publish an announcement in the newspaper, soliciting reports. Anyone who can truthfully report the counterfeit LUX cream will be handsomely rewarded. The names of the informants will be kept strictly confidential to avoid any trouble. In addition, customers who purchase LUX cream in bulk are advised to trade directly with the factory.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Shanghai Mental Hospital</h3>
<p>Branch located in Chunjiang Villa, Connaught Road</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest commercial port in East Asia, with a population of over three million. However, only a small number of people live in affluence. Recently, the rural economy has collapsed, the commercial sector in Shanghai has declined, and the number of unemployed has surged. The strong become desperate and take risks, while the weak suffer various stimuli and struggle to make a living. Some commit suicide, and others become mentally ill. Mr. Gu Wenjun from Chuansha, out of compassion for the suffering of those afflicted with mental illness, established the Shanghai Mental Hospital on Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, at his own expense last spring. Based on the secret recipes passed down through seven generations of his family, he came forward to help the world. Since its opening, the hospital has cured more than two hundred men and women suffering from mental illness. Subsequently, as the wards in Ren'an Lane became insufficient, he added the first branch in Chunjiang Villa, Connaught Road, in June of this year. He rented two Western-style three-story buildings, creating over fifty wards for patients. The location is quiet, and the air is fresh, making it an ideal place for treating mental illness. Since its establishment, many patients from other provinces and cities have been sent to the hospital for treatment, and remarkable results have been achieved, with patients recovering and being discharged. Therefore, the families of patients are all satisfied and grateful.</p>
<h3>Zhang Derong Commits Suicide by Smoking Opium Under Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>Zhang Derong, a 38-year-old man from Yangzhou, lived at No. 25, Lane 138, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. He usually made a living selling vegetables. Recently, due to poor business, his income could not cover his expenses, leading to severe economic hardship. As a result, Zhang frowned all day, sighed constantly, and felt resentful of life. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, he had a quarrel with his wife, Ms. Wang, over trivial household matters. Afterwards, Zhang became even more resentful and developed a desire to end his life. He made an excuse to go out, bought opium, and secretly ingested it. Upon returning home, he was already suffering from poisoning and collapsed on the bed, groaning incessantly. His wife discovered him, was horrified, and immediately took him to Tongren Hospital. However, the medical treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported the incident to the Hongkou Police, who ordered an investigation. The body was then transported to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, the prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the office to examine the body. Based on the report from Chinese police chief Zhu Mengwei, Tang determined that the deceased, Zhang Derong, had indeed died by taking poison. The body was released to Zhang's wife, Ms. Zhang Wang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Announces Regulations for Classified Business Management</h3>
<p>After the French Concession Municipal Council submitted and the French Consulate General in Shanghai approved the "Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council Regulations for Classified Business Management" on August 28, 1928, it has been amended several times. Since the last amendment (May 10, 1934) was implemented, the council has revised these classified business regulations again, totaling eighteen articles. The Municipal Council resolved to submit it to the French Consul General in Shanghai for approval, abolished the previous regulations, and decided to implement the new regulations. The regulations state that all workshops, factories, arts and crafts, work sites, markets, shops, and all industrial or commercial businesses that endanger or hinder public order, sanitation, tranquility, or public morality shall be subject to these regulations. However, the articles are quite lengthy. Important points are excerpted below. Managers or agents who violate these regulations shall be fined between one and one thousand yuan and may be subject to other legal penalties. In case of an offense, a fine of between ten and two thousand yuan may be imposed, and the business license may be revoked upon the recommendation of the Municipal Council Board of Directors. If dissatisfied with the rejection, an appeal may be filed with the Council Board of Directors within three days of receiving the rejection notice (this appeal should be sent to the Classified Business Office). All classified businesses approved or unapproved by the French Consulate General or the Council before the promulgation of these regulations must comply with the regulations within one year of the promulgation.</p>
<h3>Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Regular Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Discussing Plans for Work Relief, Agricultural Relief, and Emergency Relief</p>
<p>According to investigations, the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai found that this summer, 36 counties including Huang'an and the Dabie Mountains Special District in Hubei Province suffered the most severe drought. Xiangyang and 12 other counties were the next most severely affected. This drought was even more severe than the droughts of 1927 and 1928 and the floods of 1926 and 1931. Statistics show that the affected area is 88,607,959 square miles, with 3,526,598 disaster victims. The loss of grain is 29,423,400 dan, and the monetary loss is estimated at 88,270,300 yuan.

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Impressions of Suiyuan</h3>
<p>(Continued) Xu Zhenhua</p>
<p>(II) The Hell and Heaven of the Western Suiyuan Countryside: The entire province of Suiyuan covers an area of 1,490,000 square miles. Mountains account for 35%, deserts 25%, and plains only 40%. Some plains are often flooded by alkaline mountain water, turning into black alkaline land unsuitable for cultivation. The remaining land suffers from imbalanced climate and rainfall, resulting in very weak productivity. The main crops are only a few types of grains and miscellaneous crops, such as wheat, millet, buckwheat, and corn. Sometimes, planting one mu (unit of area) of wheat yields only 200 jin (unit of weight), with each jin priced at 2.5 fen (unit of currency), totaling only 5 yuan (unit of currency). With such land value and heavy taxes, the livelihood of farmers is imaginable. The countryside is desolate. Often, one has to travel forty to fifty li (unit of distance) or one to two hundred li to find a village. A village may have twenty to thirty or forty to fifty households. Most houses are made of yellow earth, and some are cave dwellings dug into the mountains. The method is to first cut the mountain slope into a flat wall, then horizontally dig one or two zhang (unit of length) deep, with a rounded arched top. Half of the cave is a pit, with a stove beside the pit. The stove is connected to a chimney made of earthen pipes, leading to the top of the mountain. The entrance of the cave is a door, with a small hole dug beside the door as a window to let in light. Hiring workers to dig a cave usually costs twelve to thirteen yuan per cave, equivalent to building an earthen house. Farmers' clothing is made of coarse cloth in summer and sheepskin in winter. Their food mainly consists of wheat, millet, sorghum, and mutton. As for white flour, the price is slightly higher, and it is only used occasionally when entertaining guests, not as daily food. The villagers' clothing, food, and shelter are so simple that one person's daily expenses are only worth five fen. However, most farmers still have no grain for the next day. The reporter and his party of more than ten people stayed in a small village called Yinliu Yaozi on their way to Kundulun Zhao. When buying food in the evening, the villagers said that the surplus grain of five or six families was not enough for ten people for one meal. Their lives were so poor that it was truly a living hell.</p>
<p>However, in such hellish rural areas of western Suiyuan, Western-style buildings with towering spires are sometimes found, surrounded by castles with strict gun and artillery defenses. Robbers dare not look directly. The interior is magnificently furnished, with electric lights, sofas, globes, pianos, and radios. All the latest material enjoyment of the city is available, which is truly like heaven in hell compared to the daily life of ordinary villagers. Those who enjoy this heavenly life are all Westerners, and there are very few Chinese. The influence of Catholicism (not Christianity) in western Suiyuan cannot be ignored. There are currently 50,000 believers and 48 churches in the entire Suiyuan. Implicitly, the economic, political, and educational rights in society are all in the hands of the churches. Each church has a large amount of land. For example, the Wushenggong Village Church in Salachi County has 100 qing (unit of area) of land, the Xiaobalagai Village Church has 500 qing of land, and the Shan'eer Village Church in Baotou has 200 qing of land. Those who cultivate the church's land are all church members, and the rent is divided 30/70. The church receives 30%, and the tenant farmers receive 70%. The national tax is borne by the church. Local taxes, such as village public expenses, fortress construction fees, and various miscellaneous levies, are borne by the tenant farmers. The priests in the church are actually big landlords, with abundant annual harvests. In terms of education, in the rural areas of western Suiyuan, the schools run by the Chinese themselves are as rare as morning stars. There are only one or two private schools and elementary schools, most of which are incomplete and poorly equipped. In the rural areas within the Catholic Church area, most of the schools are attached to the churches. Taking the 24 Qingdi Village in Sa County as an example, the village has more than 100 households and a population of 2,000, of which more than 90% are church members. The church has 110 qing of land and has established one junior high school for boys and girls each, one complete elementary school for boys and girls each, and one kindergarten for boys, with more than 20 teachers and staff, including five female teachers from Belgium who specialize in French, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and more than 600 male and female students. In addition, there is also an orphanage for girls. Poor families with female infants whose parents cannot afford to raise them are taken in by the church, provided with food and clothing, and given education. Most of these women serve the Catholic Church for life. For such a small village with a population of 2,000, the education is so developed that it is truly astonishing. Currently, 70% of the entire village is literate, and no male or female child is out of school. In a few years, the entire village will be intellectuals. However, these intellectuals are created by the Catholic Church, and they only know the priest in their hearts and do not know the country. The reporter once asked a senior elementary school student about ten years old, "Where are you from?" The student replied, "24 Qingdi." When asked, "Which country does 24 Qingdi belong to?" The student was stunned and did not know how to answer. Such elementary school education is also a painful thing. The ignorant people in the church area only follow the priest's words. Even non-church members turn pale at the mention of the word "priest." The reporter personally saw a church member in a small village in Sa County kneeling on the ground and kowtowing for forgiveness because he offended the priest, and the priest scolded him angrily, looking extremely fierce. The priests in the church area are actually no different from chieftains in a place. Recently, farmers in Sanbian, northern Shaanxi, unable to bear the abuse of French priests, sent representatives to Xi'an to request the recovery of the church area's land. Subsequently, the Shaanxi Provincial Government sent personnel to Beiping to negotiate with the French through Jin Zhi, the diplomatic commissioner of the five provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shaanxi. The French side demanded that China redeem the land at two-thirds of the original price. This negotiation is still in progress. According to the records, Sanbian is Anbian, Dingbian, and Jingbian, and the land originally belonged to Suiyuan but is now under the jurisdiction of Shaanxi. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, a French Catholic priest was killed by the people of Fudi. The following year, France negotiated with the governors-general of Shaanxi and Gansu and demarcated a piece of land in Sanbian to the French to build a church. The French took an inch and wanted a foot, occupying civilian land and collecting taxes and handling people's disputes, encroaching on more and more civilian land, as if it were their colony. The power of the Catholic Church is also one of the problems in the Northwest, and it should be paid attention to by those who govern the country. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The China Football Association opened yesterday. Two matches in the "Zhong" group were held in Zhenru and Jiangwan, respectively. The Zhenru team lost to Weihua three to four due to its weak forward strength. Fudan University defeated Commercial College four to zero.</p>
<p>Weihua Defeats Zhenru. Zhenru is the Jinan University team, which has long been famous, but in recent years, its talents have been scattered, and its strength has been greatly reduced. Weihua is formed by the merger of Youth, Lafayette, etc., and its strength is average. They are all promising materials. Yesterday, the two teams met at Jinan University in Zhenru, and the competition was quite fierce. There were many excessive actions, but the performance was quite satisfactory. In the first half, Weihua scored two goals by Zhu Xiaoyun and Fu Zhibin, leading Zhenru by two to zero. At the beginning of the second half, Fu Zhibin scored another goal, and Zhenru was in danger of being defeated by three to zero. The entire army was angry and immediately launched a crusade, aggressively advancing. Wang Nanzhen made the first contribution, and Qiu Zhenan disturbed the enemy's border, sneaking across Chencang, also making a contribution. After losing two goals in a row, Weihua carefully and jointly resisted. Zhang Guowei launched an uprising in the frontier and scored another goal, taking the lead by four to two. Seeing that time was pressing, Zhenru made a final effort and won back a city by Hui Rongzhong. As a result, Weihua won by four to three. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Weihua</p>

<h3>A Record of the Manila Overseas Chinese Sports Meet</h3>
<p>36 Organizations and 64 Teams Participate</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held at the Far Eastern Games Football Field</p>
<p>The opening ceremony follows the order of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>(Special correspondent Yan Wenchun sent from the Philippines)</p>
<p>Since the Manila Overseas Chinese organized the Philippine Overseas Chinese Sports Association, they have spared no effort in promoting sports. This year's Double Tenth Festival specially prepared a National Day Sports Meet, and its declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>In this time of national crisis, if we want to overspend and celebrate the National Day, not only most overseas Chinese do not have this happy mood, but even the residents of the place may think that we do not know how to learn from pain. Therefore, on the occasion of the National Day, in order to decorate it slightly, we can only promote the sports meet, and in the midst of perseverance, take measures to train a strong physique, so that the useful spirit, money, and time will not be invested in vain. (Omission) I think that the people are members of the country, and when the country is in trouble, a strong physique is not enough to defend oneself and defend the country. After the European War, Germany was bound by the Treaty of Versailles and could not carry out military training as much as possible. Instead, it was replaced by large-scale sports activities. Although my country's current situation is not as desperate as Germany's at that time, the people's physical fitness is weaker than that of the Germans. What is expected is that in the future, we will recover the lost land and avenge the humiliation, which cannot be done with a weak body. Therefore, the purpose of this Double Tenth Festival Sports Meet is not only to compete for the length of a day and win this championship. In order to make effective promotion, the Overseas Chinese Sports Association will start from this. I hope that my overseas Chinese will use their precious spare time to engage in physical training, and in the future, they will return to the country and participate in the National Games of the motherland, or they may be selected to attend the World Games, so that the future progress of overseas Chinese sports can be said to have started from this Double Tenth Festival. (Omission)</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of the Preparatory Committee. After the declaration was issued by the Overseas Chinese Sports Association, the Preparatory Committee for the National Day Sports Meet was established, and Yang Qitai, the president of the Overseas Chinese Education Association, was elected as the chairman. Chen Zhang'e, the former sports director of Jinan University, was hired as the chief secretary. Committees for economy, competition, prizes, publicity, team organization, and referees were established, and letters were sent to various intellectual members of the overseas Chinese business, academic, and newspaper circles to join. They started working on October 1st, and the deadline was very tight. Fortunately, all groups accelerated the progress, so everything was in order.</p>
<p>(2) Active Participation of Various Organizations and the Education Sector. Various ball sports organizations in Manila are very developed, so 35 units registered to participate, with a total of 64 teams. There are nine football teams, fifteen basketball teams, nine men's volleyball teams, three women's volleyball teams, six tennis teams, four swimming teams, two individual participants, and seven track and field teams, as well as eight individual participants. Except for the lack of baseball and national defense, it can be said that everything is available. It has the prototype of the Far Eastern Games and the National Games. There are more than 600 athletes in each team. Unfortunately, due to the urgency of the preparation time, overseas Chinese groups in various states and foreign ports could not join, which is also a great pity.</p>
<p>(3) The Grandeur of the Opening Ceremony. The conference was held at the new Rizal Sports Field (the football field of the Far Eastern Games) at 2:30 PM on National Day. The flags of China, the United States, and the Philippines fluttered outside the gate, and the stage was also full of national emblems. Wireless radio sound systems were installed, so the speeches and reports of results were clear and audible. The central football field and running track were repaired and looked particularly pleasing to the eye. The audience around the square could see everything at a glance. When the opening ceremony arrived, the athletes of each team lined up in the open space outside the field according to the order of the draw, and then the marching band of the 236th Boy Scout Regiment played a marching song in the front, followed by the Boy Scouts of the Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Zhongxi School, the Zhongshan School, and the Youth Association, followed by the girls' team participating in the performance of the First Girls' School, followed by the women's team, followed by the men's team of each organization, circling the entire field for a week. The military music was melodious, the steps were neat, and the atmosphere of the entire audience was also very solemn. Then, they gathered in front of the command stand. The master of ceremonies announced the opening of the meeting. First, the Boy Scout Band played the Party and National Anthem, then blew the trumpet to raise the conference flag, and then Yang Qitai, the chairman of the conference, announced the</p>
<p>purpose of the meeting, saying that in this period of national crisis, promoting sports is the fundamental plan to save the country. Only a healthy nation can have a healthy country. This time, due to the short preparation time, all sectors participated very actively, and even the overseas Chinese in Baguio sent a team to participate. This kind of spirit is admirable, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Deng, the Consul General of China in the Philippines, gave a speech, saying that there are three main points in sports: first, everyone should train their own physique to cope with the environment; second, everyone should have a spirit of cooperation; and third, they should obey the referees and learn from each other, etc. (5) Mr. Yala, the Minister of Transportation, representing the Philippine Sports Association, said in his speech that the Philippine Sports Association naturally encourages and promotes the sportsmanship of people living in the Philippines. Moreover, China and the Philippines are in the same corner of the earth, and the friendship between them has close relations in the system. The people of China and the Philippines do not want to and cannot break this close relationship.</p>
<p>(6) The athletes' oath (female athletes representing the Overseas Chinese Middle School). After the opening ceremony, the finals of various track and field events were held under the watchful eyes of everyone. In the football field, the First Girls' School performed dumbbell exercises and towel dances to arouse the audience's interest.</p>
<p>(5) Start of the Sports Meet. The preparation time for this conference was short, and the finals could not be held in advance. Moreover, due to various reasons, the track and field competition had to be completed in one day, so a compromise method of preliminary rounds in the morning and finals in the afternoon was adopted. In the morning, all track and field athletes gathered at the Rizal Sports Field and held the preliminary rounds under the scorching sun. Each athlete worked hard to compete because the preliminary rounds had the right to win the finals. During the preliminary rounds, the teams with a large number of participants were divided into several groups, and the top three in each group with the best results were given the right to the finals. Therefore, except for the 10,000-meter race and the 400-meter relay, which were finals, the remaining finals were held in the afternoon after the opening ceremony. The Baguio Overseas Chinese Youth Association football team, which came from thousands of miles away, and the Minbu Overseas Chinese Shangyi Society football team performed a friendly performance on the field at the same time. Due to the long-distance bus ride at night and insufficient sleep time, the Baguio team also did not have the opportunity to practice on the spot, so it lost to Shangyi with a score of 0 to 6. After 5 o'clock, there was a football match between Nanjin and Qingnan. Both sides were strong, and neither side gained anything in the first half. Nanjin scored a goal in the second half, but 15 minutes before the end of the match, the referee announced the suspension of the match because the sky was dark and could not be fought again, and did not give a verdict. The Supreme Arbitration Committee of the Conference canceled the second half in accordance with the rules and re-matched the time.</p>
<p>(6) The Enthusiasm of the Audience. The Rizal Sports Field is close to the overseas Chinese urban area, and the small motorcycle ride is one yuan. On National Day, more than half of the merchants did not stop trading. More than 3,000 people attended the event on that day (the tickets were divided into three and one corner). Fearing that the Filipinos would become more suspicious of this large-scale organization, except for a few people who were related to the sports field, they were invited to participate, and they did not dare to publicize it in the foreign newspapers. Since the opening ceremony, the overseas Chinese community has had a very good impression of sports. The local municipal government does not allow business on Sundays, and will promote sports in the future to break the improper entertainment of young people in the overseas Chinese community.</p>
<p>(7) Various Competitions are Actively Underway. In addition to the track and field finals and two football matches on the opening day, the remaining various sports are held separately on Saturday nights and Sunday nights due to the occupational relationships of the participants. The general football, basketball, and volleyball have many participants. The competition method uses a combination of elimination and round-robin systems, that is, each item is divided into two groups, A and B, and each group competes in a round-robin, and then the top two teams from each group compete in a round-robin again. The scheduled date must be before Christmas to be able to close the curtain.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the National Vocational and Labor Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Venue Remains at the Mingzhi Building of the Examination Yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education is organizing the National Exhibition of Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Education Achievements for the 23rd year of the Republic, scheduled to open on December 1st. The preparatory staff appointed by the Ministry of Education, including Gu Zhaolin, Tang Xifen, Zhou Bangdao (Standing), Dai Yingguan, Wu Yan Yin, Zhong Lingxiu, Xu Yi, Yu Dehui, Li Jiaxiang, and Cui Daozan, held a meeting yesterday (only Zhong Daozan returned to the meeting after inspecting vocational education in Beiping). It was decided that the exhibition venue would remain at the Mingzhi Building of the Examination Yuan (currently not needed due to the extended session of the Fifth Plenary Session and will be fully available for the exhibition after November 15th). The internal organization of the exhibition is divided into four groups: (1) General Affairs and Reception Group, with one director in charge of all affairs of the group, divided into documentation, general affairs, accounting, and reception sections; (2) Collection and Display Group, with a director overseeing product collection, arrangement, and display sections; (3) Judging Group, with seven to nine judges and five secretaries, responsible for the examination, allocation, research, evaluation, and awarding of achievements; (4) Editorial Group, divided into editorial and advertising sections. All the above positions, except for the ten preparatory staff members appointed by the Ministry of Education as mentioned above, have not yet been assigned.

<h3>Changshu Schools Discover Misappropriation of Large Sums of Money by the Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>The Changshu County education funds are severely in arrears, with some schools owed for as long as thirteen months. After the new director, Lu Jingmo, took office, he initially promised to make payments on time. He previously obtained approval from the Finance Department to borrow 37,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank and only released the funds for August and half of September. According to the county's education expenses, approximately 16,000 yuan is needed each month. Based on the amount borrowed, it should not have been limited to only one and a half months. Currently, according to the schools' investigation, the Bureau of Education reported to the Department of Education that the expenses for July, August, September and March of this year had been released. However, the schools have only received the full amount for August and 50% for September, with nothing received for the rest. There are also concerns about the expenses for July. On the afternoon of the 25th, a large number of principals gathered to inquire with the bureau. More than ten people, including Sun Gongyuan, principal of the county's junior high school, attended. Director Lu received them and the principals stated that they had recently seen in the newspaper that the Bureau of Education had reported to the Department of Education that the education fees for July, August, and September had been released, but the principals had not actually received the fees for July. Now, teachers are demanding the July education fees based on the Bureau's report, and the principals have no way to respond, so they have come to inquire. Director Lu replied that the funds for July had indeed not been released. As for the report to the Department of Education, they should not interfere. The principals, seeing no results, went to the county government to petition. According to County Magistrate Zhai, the Bureau of Education's report had not been forwarded by the county government and was sent directly, so the contents were unknown. He promised to investigate and make supplementary payments. The representatives were then satisfied and left. According to outside investigations, the amount involved is approximately over 10,000 yuan. The Bureau of Education had misappropriated the funds due to other overspending. However, fearing investigation by the county government, they directly reported to the department using express mail. Now that it has been discovered, the truth should come to light soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Pan Gongzhan as Representative to the Tenth Anniversary of Great China University</h3>

<h3>Jiaotong University Establishes Automotive Mechanical Engineering Department at the Request of the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>Subsidized by the Economic Commission with 8,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Preparations are Complete and Classes Have Officially Begun</p>
<p>The National Economic Commission believes that in recent years, as more highways are being built in various provinces, there is an urgent need to reserve talent in automotive machinery. During the previous conference of the communications commissions of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai, it was resolved that the Economic Commission would establish a training institute for highway machinery and vehicle personnel, to be organized by the commission's highway office. The original plan was divided into advanced machinery, general machinery, and vehicle affairs classes. The Economic Commission believed that training for advanced machinery personnel should be conducted in a specialized department within a university of mechanical engineering to meet the need. Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Commission, considered that National Jiaotong University was the highest institution for cultivating mechanical talent. He instructed the Commission's highway office to send personnel to Shanghai to negotiate with the university and promised to provide a one-time subsidy of 8,000 yuan to cover the costs of equipment for opening the department. The university, considering the importance of talent cultivation, agreed to add an automotive mechanical engineering division to the fourth year of the College of Mechanical Engineering starting this year. Classes have officially begun. In terms of curriculum, the first semester includes automotive engineering, automotive design, automotive engineering experiments and repair, and road engineering. The second semester includes automotive management, automotive design, automotive engineering experiments and driving, automotive transportation, aircraft engines, and other subjects. All the equipment needed for this division, such as automotive engines with chassis, automotive engine accessories, automotive repair equipment, automotive testing equipment, tire repair equipment, and vehicles for driving, will be purchased with the 8,000 yuan subsidy. The teaching expenses for the division will be covered by the university.</p>

<p>London pure gold rebounded, the standard gold price rose by $2.10</p>
<p>▲Negative news caused the market to weaken again after rising▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw London pure gold rebound, and confidence was boosted by the expectation that customs gold would rise. Market prices subsequently rebounded. However, rumors about silver taxes were rampant, and the outlook remained pessimistic. Powerful players continued to sell, fearing special changes. Sentiment was uneasy, and buying interest remained weak. In the morning, overseas silver markets and Anglo-American silver markets were flat, forward silver markets contracted, exchange rates also fell, and London raw gold rebounded by nine pence, further boosting confidence. The pre-market</p>
<p>preparatory trading opened higher at $82.30, and then continued to rise. After the market opened, the Central Bank's listed exchange rates showed the British rate flat and the American rate down by 0.0625. Customs gold rose by one cent, and the standard gold price increased to $991. Even after the announcement, sentiment remained positive, but bank buying was weak, and bid prices were low. Although prices rose, there were many offers, but banks were taking advantage of the low prices. As a result, prices were easily raised again after falling. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced its exchange rates, with both British and American rates flat. At this time, the overall trend fluctuated. After the market opened, rumors spread that the equalization tax would be raised by half a percent, and buying interest suddenly surged, approaching the $90 mark. However, major players were indifferent and sold on the high, making it difficult for prices to rise further. Shortly after, the Central Bank announced that the equalization tax would remain unchanged at 8.25%, and the British exchange rate was calculated at one shilling four pence and seventy-five. Small investors rushed to sell, causing prices to fall. However, none of these developments had a significant impact. Major players took advantage of the low prices to buy, and prices rose again after falling. Powerful players repeatedly supplied gold, and even though the Guangdong community took the opportunity to buy slightly on the cheap, the gold market still fluctuated and fell. This was largely due to renewed rumors about the banking sector, such as the equalization tax being calculated based on the date banks reported customs declarations (previously, it was calculated on the date of shipment, making banks unwilling to supply bills of exchange due to excessive risk), and the proposed cancellation or reduction of the 10% surtax. These negative rumors caused significant unease, and selling pressure mounted, causing the gold market to break through the $80 mark. However, buyers still took advantage of the low prices to become active, and prices rose above $80 by noon, managing to maintain the rebound. Although the total amount of contracts remained at over 34,000, long positions exceeded short positions. Currently, there are 61 long positions and 56 short positions. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $986, up $6.70 from the previous close. Fuyu Sheng, Datong Yi, and other firms increased their contracts, rising to $8. Yuankang Xiang, Shenkang, and</p>

Fuchang Richang Hengxing advanced to $7. Tongchun Heng Yu, Fuyu Yifeng Yong supplied contracts, falling back to $5.40. After the market entered, Yongli Yuanmao Yong Dafayong and others took contracts. Initial rumors of a half-percent drop in the equalization tax caused prices to rise to $9.90.

Dalian Gang, Hengxing Yuanyi Cheng took contracts, gradually rising to $3.50. However, the overall trend was weak, and many small investors panicked. Coupled with the supply from Hengxing Fuxing Yong Futai Heng Hengxing Yuan and others, prices fell to $79.30. Dalian Gang and Yicheng Yuanxing and others urgently bought in, and although there was supply from Fuchang Yuqing Yong and others, prices fluctuated and rose to $82. The noon closing price was $981.40. After the close, Hengxing Yuanyi Cheng</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchants Leaning towards Supplying Foreign Exchange, Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the London large bar and New York silver markets were flat. Canadian silver forward rates rose slightly by 0.01 to 0.03 cents. London raw gold rose by nine pence. The British rate against the US rate contracted by 0.0125, the US rate against the British rate</p>
<p>contracted by 0.0375, the British rate against the French rate remained unchanged, and the US rate against the French rate fell by 0.0375. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices, with the British rate at one shilling four pence and the American rate at $33.125, reflecting a tightening of 0.0625 for the British rate and 0.25 for the American rate compared to the previous close. However, the situation was uncertain. After the opening, banks' appetite for buying was normal, and Chinese merchants had to supply slightly cheaper. However, with the Central Bank's customs gold rate rising by one cent and the gold market stable, the domestic market was stable. Nevertheless, the underlying trend tended to ease. HSBC's announcement of its exchange rates, with both British and American rates flat, and the equalization tax remaining unchanged, kept the exchange market calm. However, based on the equalization tax calculation for today, the British rate needed to be one shilling three pence and eighty-seven and a half to ship silver for export. As a result, banks, aside from trading against each other, lacked the appetite to sell. However, with rumors causing the gold market to fall, Chinese merchants had the appetite to sell, making the process slightly difficult. It was hoped that the news would lead to some activity in the banks' positions. By the noon close, the near-term selling price was one shilling four pence and 0.0625 for the British rate and $33.3125 for the American rate, reflecting a flat British rate and a tightening of 0.0625 for the American rate compared to the previous close. Banks such as MacGary slightly arbitraged. Chinese merchants netted approximately over twenty million dollars in American currency and a small amount in British currency. In addition, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu slightly arbitraged American dollars. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Showed Weak Sentiment in the Aftermarket</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only traded for November. December futures must be listed on the 29th after the handover. The market trading was very light, and the trend was still uncertain. Only Numbers 48 and 53 were sold in the first lot of the morning, which was extremely enthusiastic. After the auction, the follow-up fell sharply by six jiao. The military reduction followed with a slight six and a half jiao. The situation was still</p>
<p>quite fierce. However, after the market opened, the buying interest of retail investors was not weak, and the decline gradually subsided. The follow-up was only slightly down by one or two jiao, which stabilized people's sentiment. The second round was unanimously up by five fen and one jiao, and the military reduction rebounded by three jiao and a half. In the afternoon, transactions decreased sharply.

<p>New York Stock Market Still Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th), the New York stock market continued to decline. The poor business report of Bethlehem Steel Company, the continued drop in gasoline prices, and the further decline in the bonds of Baldwin Locomotive Works on the small exchange led to the market collapsing. However, pressure eased before the close, and there was a slight rebound. The bond market trended downward, and the small exchange was also dragged down by Baldwin. Chicago wheat rose due to short covering caused by unfavorable Australian wheat news. The total volume traded was 870,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Auction, Yarn Fluctuations Small</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the trend is becoming increasingly stable. After the wild ups and downs, most people are cautious and have reduced the scope of their operations. As a result, the number of yarn stored for auction has decreased by one-third. Market fluctuations are minimal, and people are waiting quietly for opportunities. Both sides will then decide the winner, so the number of transactions is very small.</p>
<h3>Jinji Trading Sparse, Market Weak</h3>
<p>The opening of the yarn auction market was marked by continued weakness in American cotton. Trading in the market was very limited, and the market sentiment was extremely scattered. Fluctuations in each month were minimal. As a result, each month fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 jiao. Empty boards were traded twice this month and in December. In the afternoon, it was reported that gold prices were flat. The opening still had a decline of 0.1 to 0.2 jiao. Later, it was reported that sales of spot yarn were 1,000 and several tens of bales, and market sentiment tightened slightly. As a result, each month was flat, with no ups or downs.

<h3>Cotton Rebounds by About Two Jiao</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quite weak due to the continuous decline in American cotton and the softening of Indian cotton. Exchange rates are stable, and there is a lack of new buyers in the market. Most of the industry is generally in a short position.</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales have become quiet again, causing people to calm down. However, Tongcheng Company turned from short to long, and the market atmosphere was slightly higher in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao, Tongcheng Turns Long</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton auction market was marked by a continued decline in American and Indian cotton. Transactions in the market were very sparse, gold prices were flat and weak, exchange rates were unchanged, and the market sentiment became looser. Each month fell by 0.15 to 0.25 jiao. The opening in the afternoon was very weak, but Tongcheng Company continued to buy, and the closing price rebounded again. As a result, each month rose by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Stock at the End of September in Chinese, British, and Japanese Mills</h3>
<p>▲Chinese Mills Decrease, Japanese Yarn Increases▲</p>
<p>According to a survey by a certain Japanese trading company, the total stock of cotton yarn in Shanghai in September was 90,780 bales, a decrease of 14,661 bales compared to the end of August. Among them, the stock of Japanese yarn in September was 17,365 bales, an increase of 1,764 bales compared to August. The stock of Chinese and British yarn was 73,145 bales, a decrease of 16,425 bales compared to the end of August. The increase in Japanese yarn is due to the high cost of raw cotton, and a reluctance to sell finished products at low prices. Chinese mills sold yarn at various prices due to the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement, so the stock decreased significantly. On the other hand, due to the cold weather in late autumn, demand is increasing, and sales are improving. The statistics of yarn count stock are listed below (unit: bales):</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Market Shows Weakness</h3>
<p>The American cotton market is narrow and hesitant, people are panicking, bulls are exiting, and the South is dumping. Liverpool is selling October futures for next year, but industry demand is increasing, and the market is maintained. Prices are unchanged, and external interest remains weak. Spot sales are sluggish. Near the close, the market price fell slightly due to the decline in the stock market. The domestic market is stable, and traders anticipate that the market price will not fall sharply. The spot price fell 5 points, and the futures price fell 4 to 6 points. British cotton futures fell one point. The Indian cotton market is sluggish and unremarkable. 平果爾 fell 1.75 rupees, 奥姆辣 fell 0.75 rupees, and 白羅溪 fell 1.25 rupees. Original telegram left (dated 26th).</p>

<h3>US Cotton Exports Decreased Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 26th of last month reported on the cotton market conditions for the week, stating that at the beginning of the week, the New York cotton market showed a trend of sharp decline. Later, due to industry purchases to cover short positions and news of slightly active domestic yarn mills' demand for spot cotton, the market became more stable. However, general trade was very quiet, and buyers were unwilling to follow the rising trend. Government loans are clearly absorbing cotton to prevent it from flooding the market, thus maintaining the market price. However, merchants are now hoping for a revival in consumer demand to help the rising trend. The climate in the South is not conducive to the development of late cotton. Several places in the western cotton belt have hopes of increasing production. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace believes that US cotton exports have decreased, which is not so much due to higher cotton prices as to the difficulty of purchasing cotton funds in the United States. According to European news, cotton spinners are still purchasing raw cotton from non-US sources, and the quantity is increasing. It is uncertain how much US cotton the world will need this season. This is what everyone here is paying attention to.</p>

<h3>Grain Exchange Rate Relationship Causes Flour Prices to Rise</h3>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, flour prices for all months showed a consistent upward trend. The price of foreign wheat was slightly better by about 1 cent in both Chicago and Canada. At the opening price, people inside and outside the industry believed that the exchange rate would not easily fall in the short term, and it would be difficult to get close to future spot wheat orders. In addition, this month is close to delivery, and factory chips are still gradually being recovered. Therefore, the opening price was favorable. Afterwards, the buying interest was very strong, and the market rose step by step. When the afternoon market opened, this month's prices rose higher and higher due to the continued favor of the factory and a more intense sentiment among some people. It can be seen that the main reason for this surge is purely that the gold price jumped horizontally after the silver tax was increased, which led to the rise in commodity prices. Therefore, the subsequent changes are greatly related to the exchange rate. As a result, this month rose by 5.5 points, November rose by 4.5 points, December rose by 3.25 points, January rose by 3.75 points, February rose by 3.5 points, and March rose by 3.75 points.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Offsets Shorts, Uniquely Rises by 7 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the market opened in the morning, the market conditions for each month were generally stable. The price of foreign wheat was only better by about 1 cent. After the opening price, trading was not active, and the market fluctuated little. When the afternoon market opened, it was still stable at first, but then the flour market continued to rise, and the market sentiment was boosted again. The buying interest in each month was lively, and the market improved. This month is also the last day of trading, and most short positions were covered. The market price once rose to 8.2 points. Although the sentiment for the long term is good, there are still fears of foreign wheat approaching, so outsiders did not dare to boldly buy. As a result, this month rose by 7 points, November rose by 4 points, December rose by 5 points, January rose by 3 points, and February rose by 3 points. The spot wheat market, which had been suspended for many days, finally opened yesterday. Due to the firm price of standard flour wheat, the asking price also rose by 3 to 5 cents. Shandong wheat opened at 3 yuan and 85 cents, Xuzhou wheat at 3 yuan and 83 cents, Yaowan Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan and 80 cents, and Jiangbei wheat at 3 yuan and 74 cents, totaling 10,000 bags, which were reportedly handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat initially fell due to unfavorable foreign telegrams and a 2 pence drop in Liverpool prices. Bulls engaged in liquidation, and prices fell. Afterwards, due to bad news about the Australian harvest, it was heard that heavy rain had caused disasters. As a result, the shorts were greatly panicked and engaged in hedging, and market prices rose. It is expected that market prices will return higher, but not by much.</p>

<h3>The Rice Market in He Xia is Also Unremarkable</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of supply from various gangs turned scarce, with only about 20 ships arriving (a total of more than 3,000 piculs of goods). Sentiment was slightly firm. However, sales in the market remained normal. Customer gangs continued to purchase 500 to 600 bags from Qingdao and Yantai, so the market shape could only be stabilized. The prices of other kiln types, six types, white rice, wild rice, and other thick new japonica, as well as Du Yangjian, etc., did not fluctuate much. There was no difference in the overcast price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 ships arrived from various places in He Xia. Sales of various colors in the market. New Geng kiln types were sluggish in the early market, but slightly better in the afternoon market. Broken Geng was still considered active. Chen Baiyuan continued to be converted by wine merchants. New Yangjian was still being melted. New Du Jian, new Chenbu, and Kejian were normal. The market shape for new higher-priced materials was tired, and the secondary price was soft by a few cents. Chen Baiyuan rose by 1 or 2 jiao. High-priced kiln types were fixed, and the secondary price was slightly lower by 1 or 2 jiao. The price of new Yangjian plus jiao, broken Geng, new Du Jian, overcast yuan, new Chenbu, and Kejian were stable, without much fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Lifts Offerings, Green Color Suddenly Rises by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>丨Subject to Exchange Rate Influence丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was quiet due to it being Saturday, with few transactions. The trend became weaker. The association's closing price for ordinary #24 coarse sand white spot was 18.8 yuan, and the local goods were 18.9 yuan. Some transactions were made at 5.7 yuan for medium goods. #8 and #9 Dutch red were closed at 14.25 yuan, down 5 cents. Re-export goods were released due to the arrival of over 10,000 pieces the day before, and the market trend suddenly loosened, falling by 25 cents to close at 5.15 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was offered at the original closing price, with no transactions. The local mill's fine white sugar also showed a declining trend. Yesterday, Zhenyu #1 was 17.3 yuan, slightly down 10 cents. Chao Gang's firms offered 94 newly arrived white lifted green color sugar at a price of 13.5 yuan, a sudden increase of 30 cents. It was found that the land price in Shantou shrank greatly due to the exchange rate, now at more than 1,050 yuan, a decrease of 80 yuan compared to the previous (highest rate). Based on the exchange rate calculation, each dan must be increased by about 1 yuan, so the market price in Shanghai and Shantou has entered a state of inverted hanging again.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Tinplate Sales are Active</p>
<p>Recently, customers from Shantou, Tianjin, and other gangs have been purchasing 35-pound tinplate, and the market situation is no longer as deserted as before. The monosodium glutamate factories and cigarette companies on this street are also buying as much as possible, so more than 200 boxes have been opened in the past few days. The market price has risen sharply, opening at 55 yuan per box, up 1 yuan compared to before. It was found that the latest overseas prices are extremely high, and very few colleagues have made purchases. The market supply is likely to be insufficient for distribution in the future. Its trend is very optimistic.</p>

<h3>Ambition</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Everyone has ambition, and ambition is endless. With this ambition, there is also that ambition; there is a small ambition when young, and a big ambition when older; whether it is a big ambition or a small ambition, there is ambition within ambition. If ambition is fulfilled, new ambition is generated again, continuously, unless you die, ambition will stop, but ambition has not yet succeeded.</p>
<p>The evolution of the world will not stop. He invented this thing, and others invented something more beneficial to the world than him. This discontinuous invention makes the world's culture continuously progress; now the world's culture has progressed to be so good, I am afraid that in the near future, it will definitely progress to be better than it is now.</p>
<p>A person's hope will not be cut off either. When young, hope is very small, but when grown up, hope will naturally become bigger. In short, the older you get, the bigger the hope, so human hope will not stop.</p>
<p>Our founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, did many great things in his life, but his revolutionary ambition was not fully successful when he passed away.</p>
<p>If we say that ambition is successful in doing anything, then there is no ambition. Children, remember that.</p>
<h3>Childhood of World Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>▲Edison</p>
<p>There were no electric lights before, and it was so inconvenient to be dark at night: there were no telephones and telegraphs before, and it was so inconvenient to communicate with friends in distant places: there were no streetcars before, and transportation was so inconvenient. After these things were invented, how much happiness we have enjoyed. Later, motion picture sound films were invented, and we don't know how much pleasure we have gained. Children, do you know who invented these things? He is the world's greatest inventor, Edison.</p>
<p>Although Edison was a great inventor, he did not receive any advanced education when he was a child. He only studied in a small school for three months, because he did not feel interested in the education he received, so he did not pay attention to the school's curriculum at all, resulting in extremely poor grades. As a result, he was expelled from school. Afterwards, only his mother taught him to read according to his personality, giving him a very good education.</p>
<p>He paid attention to experiments since he was a child, and he would not believe anything until he had experimented with it. He knew that hens could hatch eggs, and he had also personally experimented with it, putting many eggs in a haystack and imitating a hen by lying on them to hatch. Although this is almost a joke, his experimental spirit can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Edison liked chemistry, and it started when he was young. At the age of eleven, he opened a small chemistry laboratory in the basement, devoting himself to chemistry work in the basement all day long. Organized and orderly, it was arranged neatly just like a physics and chemistry laboratory. These are the foundations for him to become a great inventor later, and we must not ignore him.</p>
<p>Edison lived to be eighty-four years old, and invented more than a thousand things, large and small, creating countless benefits for the world.</p>

<h3>National Hero Yue Fei</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>Yue Fei, everyone knows that he is a hero. He was a person of the Song Dynasty. At that time, the Jin soldiers, like the current Japanese, fought into China, wanting to seize the Song Dynasty's Jiangshan. The two princes were captured by the Jin kingdom. The Jin kingdom's general, Jin Wuzhu, led 100,000 soldiers, mighty and majestic, and killed into China, all the way like a broken bamboo. The soldiers defending the territory died or surrendered. At that time, a Yue Fei appeared. He was a brave and good child since he was a child, and he had the ambition to love the country since he was a child. His mother tattooed the four characters "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" on his back. At that time, he saw that the country was in extreme danger, so he rose up to resist the Jin soldiers and won repeatedly. Later, the emperor named him Grand Marshal, and he led a large army, like a tiger with wings, killing Jin Wuzhu and fleeing in defeat, and the restoration of the country was just around the corner. It is hateful that at that time there was a traitor, Qin Hui, who slandered in front of the emperor and summoned Yue Fei back with twelve gold medals and killed him in Fengbo Pavilion.</p>
<p>Children! Today's China is more dangerous than China in the Song Dynasty! Japanese imperialism is driving straight in like this, and it is a pity that there is no good man like Yue Fei to stop them!</p>
<p>Children! Work hard! I hope you will make up your minds to save the country and become Yue Fei the Second!</p>

<h3>Several Unique Fish</h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>We know that on this earth, whether land animals, aquatic animals, or plants, there are many unique ones.</p>
<p>Today, let's first study several unique fish with the children:</p>
<p>1. Archerfish Archerfish are all produced in the fresh water of East India. They are five or six inches long and flat in shape. When archerfish are swimming, they often stick their heads out of the water and keep their bodies straight obliquely. At this time, if they see a flying insect flying over the water surface, they will suck a mouthful of water and use all their strength to spray it on the flying insect. Because the flying insect has no defense, it is shot down into the water, and the archerfish uses it as food.</p>
<p>2. Flying Fish Flying fish like to live in warm places everywhere in the sea. Flying fish are very small in size, and the largest one is in the California region of the United States, and is only about eighteen inches long. When a flying fish flies, it is probably forced by an enemy to have no way to avoid it, so it tries hard to move its tail and rushes out of the water, flying in the air for about two hundred yards before falling back into the water. Flying fish do not fly in the air as often as birds.</p>
<p>3. Nesting Fish Nesting fish are a common type of fish in Europe and the United States. They are slender and laterally compressed, with two or three spines on the back. Those that live in fresh water have ten or fifteen spines on the back, and those that live in the ocean. When nesting fish are building nests, they always choose a recessed place at the muddy bottom as the nesting site, and then use all the fallen leaves, grass stems, and other fibrous things at the bottom of the water as nesting materials.</p>
<p>4. Sailfish Sailfish are produced in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the western part of the Atlantic Ocean. Sailfish are a large fish, and the body length is more than six feet. The fins on the back stand out from the water like a sail, so we call it sailfish. The upper jaw of the sailfish is as long as a sword, and the sailfish uses this thing as a weapon for hunting and defense.</p>
<p>5. Anglerfish Anglerfish all live on the seabed, and there are many produced along the coast of our country. The body is about five feet long, the head is large, and the body gradually becomes smaller, straight down to the tail. On the upper jaw of the anglerfish's head, there are three tentacles, two with pointed ends and one with a small flap at the end. Children, this tentacle with a flap at the end is like a fisherman's fishing rod, and the flap is the fragrant bait. As long as this tentacle shakes, the small fish in the distance think it is something to eat and swim close to this tentacle. The anglerfish shrinks this tentacle close to its mouth, and waits for the small fish to get close to its mouth, then it opens its mouth and swallows it.</p>
<p>Children, the left picture shows the shapes of five unique fish:</p>
<h3>Willow</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>A round pond, with four or five weeping willows planted around the pond, the soft strands hanging down, weaving a natural emerald green curtain.</p>
<p>Every morning and evening, pairs of birds often sing melodious songs in the willow shade until they are disturbed, and then they fly away very cleverly.</p>
<p>In summer, one cicada after another hides on several willow branches, humming "zhile zhile" all day long. When the autumn wind rises, the leaves fall one by one, and the cicada's voice disappears with it.</p>
<p>These pieces of yellow leaves float from the tree to the pond, and the surface of the water seems to be covered with a light yellow velvet blanket. The fish in the pond, in twos and threes, whenever they see a yellow leaf floating on the water, they treat it as food and quickly swim over to scramble for it.</p>
<p>On summer nights, the sky is blue without a cloud, and the snow-white bright moon is hidden vaguely at the tip of the willow tree, with a few twinkling stars inlaid beside it. A hammock made of red and green striped cloth was hung on the main trunk of those two weeping willows, and I lay on this hammock, swaying back and forth, looking at the bright moon, blowing the cool breeze, how refreshing!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a small thing landed on my face. I suspected it was some kind of flying insect. I touched it with my hand, and it turned out to be a willow leaf. It also came to give me a message, saying that autumn has already arrived.</p>
<p>Willow! Lovely weeping willow! Everyone wants to be friends with it. Now that summer has passed, I often linger under the willow shade reluctantly for a while.</p>
<h3>How to Make a Church Model</h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Children! I guess you have already learned the craft of tailoring in school, right? Many of my friends have told me that they feel particularly interested in small crafts. In fact, how can it be that only a few of them feel particularly interested? There are many groups of children in the world who feel the same interest. Because it can inspire children's scientific thinking and display children's research abilities, small crafts are closely related to children's education. Here, let me introduce to you a very simple way to make a church model. You can imitate it and try it out.</p>
<p>Materials: A piece of cardboard, a ruler, a small knife, a bottle of glue, and a sheet of vermilion glossy paper.</p>
<p>Production method: First, build the cardboard into three kinds of planar prototypes as shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3. However, the black door shown in Figure 3 should be removed. At the same time, the dotted lines in the three figures indicate that when building, you should gently not cut it off, just have a knife mark to facilitate folding. (If you want to make a larger one, you can enlarge the above figure proportionally by several times.) Then put the built ones together, as shown in Figure 4. Then take the paper strips and stick them on the cracks. After drying, carefully stick the glossy paper on it. As for the cross on top, you can make it with thin lead wire and insert it to complete a beautiful chapel.</p>
<h3>Where is Sesame in the West?</h3>
<p>— Miao Shen</p>
<p>When I used to read fairy tales, I remembered a story... roughly it was in a mountain. There was a strange cave. The two doors of the cave were always closed unless you could say a term and shout, "Open Sesame quickly." There were countless gold and silver treasures in this cave. At that time, a person received instructions from an immortal. He loaded several sacks of gold and silver treasures from the cave and transported them out with donkeys and horses. At that time, I felt very envious when I saw it, and thought that it would be nice if there was an immortal to instruct me! I think children in childhood may have had a common feeling like this.</p>
<p>Children, don't you say, is this a mystery? In fact, if I tell you, you will know that this is a very easy mystery to guess. So what is the answer to the mystery? It's our family.</p>
<p>Everyone has a family! I am afraid that children are in the family every day, and most of them do not feel the benefits of the family? This is also no wonder to you! People who are used to eating sweet things will not know what bitterness tastes like.</p>
<p>We only need to think: who will bear our tuition fees besides our own family? Can we go to other families every day to eat, sleep, and enjoy them forever? Aren't the people in your own family the ones who love you the most? There is boundless warmth and love in the family, and these are countless gold and silver treasures, which may be more valuable than gold and silver treasures; because gold and silver treasures cannot exchange for the precious warmth and love in the family! So I now understand that the "Sesame" treasure cave is our family. There are things in our family that are more valuable than "Sesame." We are in the treasure cave, and don't be unaware of it, children!</p>
<h3>Can Animals Also Play Games?!</h3>
<p>— Pei Fang</p>
<p>Our little friends are naturally lively and all love to play games. Patting a ball, kicking a shuttlecock, swinging on a swing, flying a kite, and playing various children's board games are all common pastimes during their free time after class. Even the sage Confucius, when he was little, liked to arrange sacrificial vessels. That is why, when he grew up, he liked to study rites and music, and eventually became a sage. Lao Laizi, at the age of seventy, often wore colorful clothes and performed various games in front of his parents, making them laugh heartily. In the early Ming Dynasty, the great Confucian Wang Mian, although he loved to read, often sat on the Buddha's lap to read. Wasn't he also enjoying himself? These sages and worthies all liked to play games, which proves that playing games is not a useless activity.</p>
<p>Human nature loves to play games; so does animal nature. One day, I was hiking and saw two beetles carrying a mud ball, rolling it on the ground, much like we kick a soccer ball or play basketball. It was very interesting. I thought: they are playing, so I shouldn't catch them and spoil their fun. It turns out that this beetle is called "dung beetle rolling a ball." Didn't Zhuang Zhou already say this?</p>
<p>We often keep a few white mice in a cage, and the cage has two wire wheels installed. These white mice, after eating their fill and having nothing to do, will definitely climb onto the wheels and push them with their front paws as hard as they can, like farmers drawing water with a waterwheel, which is commonly called swinging. Isn't this the white mice playing?</p>
<p>As long as the game is not overdone, it is beneficial to health, invigorates the blood, and aids digestion. It is most beneficial. In ancient times, people observed game-like movements such as "bear stretching and bird flexing," and then invented "fist techniques." Fist techniques are also a type of game and can strengthen the body and defend against enemies. Little friends, learn a few sets of "fist techniques" and play!</p>
<h3>Pencil</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>About four hundred years ago, a type of black lead was discovered in the mines of the Cumberland region of England. At that time, the workers in the mine smeared the black lead on the ground and found it to be very smooth, black, and clear. As a result, it caused a sensation throughout the country, and people everywhere competed to buy this black lead. The British government also promulgated laws prohibiting the export of black lead abroad. The value of black lead was even more precious than ink and writing ink. For a time, wealthy and famous people almost used black lead to write letters, considering it to be the most fashionable. This black lead is the ancestor of the pencils we use daily today. Later, a Frenchman named Conte mixed clay with black lead and baked it into the core of the pencils we use today. This was the first successful step in improving the pencil. Later, black lead was gradually discovered in Bavaria in Germany, Bohemia in Austria, Ceylon in India, Mexico, and other places. As a result, pencils became popular all over the world. What was once regarded as a very precious item, only used by the wealthy, became less rare and gradually spread to the general population. Pencils were first imported into our country from Japan, about forty years ago. Because Japan began imitating pencil production in the Meiji 30s (1897-1907), they were successively imported into our country. Although a few people used them before, they were all private goods in a few foreign firms. As for how pencils are made, what is the process like? I will explain the simple steps below:</p>
<p>(1) The pencil shaft: The material for the pencil shaft comes from the cedar region of the United States. It is a type of shaded forest wood with fine, loose texture. The wood from other countries is not as good as it. Japanese goods use wood from Hokkaido as a substitute. The high-quality materials used in our country are mostly imported from the United States. The method of making the shaft is to first dry the wood board to remove the moisture in the board. Then, it is cut into long, thin rod shapes on a wood-cutting machine. Then, a hole-drilling machine is used to drill grooves for the pencil lead. Then, it is joined together with glue and dried with electric heat. The pencil lead is inserted, and then it is placed on a shaft-shaping machine and filed into a round or hexagonal shape.</p>
<p>(2) The pencil lead: The process of manufacturing the pencil lead is very complicated because the core is made of black lead, clay, carbon, and other materials. The amount of each component determines the hardness or softness. Pencils with a high black lead content are soft, such as 3B, 4B, etc. B represents black and soft. Pencils with a high clay content are hard, such as H, 2H, etc. H represents hard and light. HB is neither soft nor hard. There are other pencils such as 7B, 7H, etc., which are for special use. The preparation of the pencil lead takes a week. First, the clay, black lead, carbon, and other ingredients are mixed well and placed in a stone mortar. They are stirred and mixed every day. After they are well combined, they are spread extremely thinly and evenly with a stick until there are no fine particles. A core-filling machine is used to load them into small holes. After the pencil lead is filled, it is placed in a pot, sealed, and baked dry. As for the pencil lead composition of colored pencils, it is made of a mixture of pigment powder, clay, wax, etc. The difference from the black lead pencil manufacturing method is that it is not baked dry in a pot. After the pencil lead of various pencils is filled, it is finally coated with red, yellow, green, and other colored paints. However, the painting process is also very troublesome. Usually, a shaft-coating machine must be used to apply the paint eight times to show the beautiful colors. After the painting is completed, a shaft-cutting machine is used to cut it to a certain length. Finally, an electric iron machine is used to stamp various trademarks and signs. Looking at it this way, the pencils we usually use may seem very simple in appearance, but in fact, they go through all sorts of complicated procedures.</p>

<h3>Several Outstanding Women in European History</h3>
<p>— Shou Zi</p>
<p>(1) Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland (1542-1587). After her husband, Francis II of France, died, she returned to Scotland to rule and employed rather ruthless methods. The people of the country were dissatisfied with her and she was forced to go to England. Due to political reasons, she was eventually beheaded.</p>
<p>(2) Queen Elizabeth of England (1533-1603). She was a lifelong spinster. England under her rule had many virtuous policies, and literature was also very developed. England's victory over the Spanish Armada was during her reign, and thus she gained dominance at sea.</p>
<p>(3) Joan of Arc, French heroine (1412-1431). She came from a peasant family. During the Hundred Years' War between England and France, the English army surrounded Orléans. She put on men's military uniform and defeated the English army. But in the end, she was captured by the English army and burned to death.</p>
<p>(4) Madame de Staël, French female writer (1766-1817). She married a poor Swedish ambassador. During the French Revolution, she was one of those who suffered. She wrote many works, including comedies, tragedies, novels, essays, and letters.</p>
<p>(5) George Sand, French female writer (1804-1876). She married at the age of eighteen and returned her property to her husband nine years later, which can be considered a polite divorce. Later, she became friends with writers and philosophers. Her works are quite well known in China.</p>
<p>(6) Catherine II, Empress of Russia (1729-1796). Her husband, the Russian Emperor Peter, was a useless person and was eventually deposed and killed by her. Russia under her rule was very strong and its power expanded outwards.</p>
<p>(7) Madame de Sévigné, French female letter writer (1626-1696). She lost her parents at a young age, and when she grew up, she married a wasteful husband. Her husband died in a duel, leaving her with only one son and one daughter. Her letters were written to her daughter after she got married and were extremely beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>(8) Madame de Maintenon, wife of Louis XIV of France (1635-1719). She came from a bad family and married a disabled poet. After he died, she was recruited into the palace to take care of the princes. She gradually manipulated politics. After Louis XIV died, he secretly married her, and her power grew even greater.</p>
<p>(9) Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria (1717-1780). She was a capable empress who worked hard for the country's strength. Her son was the enlightened monarch Joseph II, and her daughter was Queen Antoinette during the French Revolution. She was a pure woman in an era that admired romance.</p>
<p>(10) Josephine, wife of Napoleon (1763-1814). Her first husband was an important figure in the French Revolution and unfortunately died on the guillotine. She had great political influence, and Napoleon's rise to prominence was due to her. But later she divorced Napoleon.</p>
<p>(11) Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI of France (1755-1793). She was extremely fond of luxury, so some say that she was the source of the French Revolution. But she was very courageous. When she went to the guillotine, her demeanor was as usual.</p>
<p>(12) Christina, Queen of Sweden (1626-1689). She was beautiful and capable. She succeeded her father as king and had a very good political record. Later, she abdicated and lived a free life, but her political influence was still very great.</p>
<p>(13) Catherine de Medici, Queen of Henry II of France (1519-1589). She was a warrior against Protestants. The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in French history was started by her. In the end, she was disliked by both Protestants and Catholics and lost her throne.</p>
<p>(14) Queen Anne of England (1665-1714). She was the last ruler of the Stuart Dynasty. During her rule, England was plagued by fierce party strife. Her administration was greatly influenced by the soldier Marlborough and his wife.</p>
<p>Looking at the above, France has the most outstanding women in European history, with a total of eight, while England has only three. Other countries such as Russia, Austria, and Sweden have one each.</p>
<h3>Reflections After Reading "Diary of a Vagrant Girl"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>丨Modern Version by Wu Sihong丨</p>
<p>In this day and age, some people advise Nora to go home, saying that women's responsibility lies in the family and in bed. I now recommend this "Diary of a Vagrant Girl."</p>
<p>At the same time, in today's world where life and death, light and darkness are fighting fiercely, I also feel that it is not a waste of time to make a simple examination of this combative "Diary of a Vagrant Girl" and to make a little criticism of the author's strategy.</p>
<p>This book contains four short stories: "Diary of a Vagrant Girl," "Mao Girl," "Homecoming," and "Luo Na." The first story is a diary, "Mao Girl" and "Luo Na" are novels, and "Homecoming" is prose.</p>
<p>The author inserts a thorough sense of revulsion towards the status quo throughout the book. This correct premise undoubtedly gives the book value. Even though the vagrant girl is not enough for us to imitate, it is a fresh blood cell input for those who look at the shackles on their own bodies with respect and those who silently let others add shackles to her. However, we know that unrecognized action is certainly blind, and it is really not flattering to recognize and act blindly. It is not only of no help to the actual situation, but also its recognition must be problematic. What kind of strategy did the author adopt towards the status quo she hated? This is worthy of our attention. Here, the author makes us quite regretful, because the author has consistently taken the path of individualism.</p>
<p>"She walks alone, following her footsteps,</p>
<p>Like life is aimless."</p>
<p>"Leaving tomorrow?</p>
<p>Where to go?</p>
<p>Think about it while walking on the road丨丨丨丨 Anyway, everything is subject to the control of fate."</p>
<p>The author made it very clear what kind of person she is. Emotions move without being controlled by reason, unprepared, unplanned, and lonely! Lacking warmth for life, losing a kind of certainty for the future (I believe the author is aware of a certain purpose when she takes her path). The result is "clueless," even entrusting our own destiny to fate!</p>
<p>People who are "clueless" often tend to go to such an extreme besides believing in fate, that is, the negation of everything.</p>
<p>""This poisonous world is full of myopic eyes, trachoma, or completely blind eyes.···············""</p>
<p>The author's negation of everything is because she has not yet clearly recognized this poisonous world. There are many myopic eyes, trachoma, and blind eyes in the world, but if you say that "there is not one that is not" myopic, trachoma, blind eyes, it is because your eyes were the first to have problems. In the movie "Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm," Tan Ying said this sentence: ""All I see is darkness!"" Because Tan Ying plays a blind person.</p>
<p>Although the author's emotions are highly fermentable, she is constantly excited, constantly struggling, but her eyes have problems, and all her attempts are often just empty theories to comfort herself.</p>
<p>""Oh, I don't have to care about anything. I must work hard to build my own world."" Clearly, the author has overestimated the power of the individual.</p>
<p>"Mao Girl" is the most pertinent of the four short stories. Although the protagonist Mao Girl is a bit too idealized, especially in the later descriptions.</p>
<p>"丨丨I don't know why I'm getting thinner. I have to eat, but sometimes I vomit after eating.</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>丨丨I don't know why I vomit, and I don't know what's wrong. I just want to eat sour things.</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>""丨丨Sometimes my stomach moves.""</p>
<p>"丨丨······Who slept on your bed after Lai Zi died?</p>
<p>丨丨The daughter of the third aunt next door.······</p>
<p>丨丨Who else?</p>
<p>丨丨I forgot, it's been a long time. Maybe it was Jiafu's servant."</p>
<p>In order to emphasize Mao Girl's simplicity and to gain the reader's greatest sympathy for Mao Girl, the author wrote with a very humorous tone, writing Mao Girl as Auntie Cao in the joke, diluting the serious theme. Mao Girl is not a mental patient. Isn't that kind of description excessive and detrimental to the truth?</p>
<p>However, "Mao Girl" is still relatively successful, whether in terms of technique, the grasp of the theme, or the structure of the story. Except for the above-mentioned minor negligence, this work is almost impeccable.</p>
<p>"Homecoming" is also written very fluently and briskly, especially the dialogue with the classmates. This is completely a living fact. Ms. Wu's homecoming is brave, and leaving home is also brave. Here, a lively woman jumps out, unwilling to succumb, unwilling to submit. However, the colors of individualism, romance, and nihilism are still very strong here. Ms. Wu is indeed a hero, but this hero is a lone army. The spirit of "who cares" is admirable, but this cannot solve the problem. To fight this poisonous society, you must take care of this society, you must first get to know it.</p>
<p>The last story, "Luo Na," has to be said to be a failed work. The organization of the story is very unreasonable, and the ending is loose and vague. Since Luo Na had already made up her mind to leave home, why did she wait so aggrievedly until she got to the city to run away? Playing the harmonica in the grass shed, selling peanuts, and going to music school are all too pretentious. The strange love affair with the young man is even more absurd and ridiculous. Finally, the character of Aunt Qiu is put in, and the description is incomprehensible. What kind of road Luo Na took in the end is not hinted at, and the ending is uninteresting.</p>
<p>Our Ms. Wu wears clothes that everyone around her looks at, "combs two small braids," and says things that women dare not say. Luo Na in the work plays the harmonica in the grass shed, causing "idle men, women, and children to come to see her," "So poor, and still playing that harmonica that can't be eaten." It makes people think of the red shirts, long hair, and as pale faces as possible of the French Romantic artists of the eighteenth century. This kind of formal eccentricity, which shows the idealized negation of the existing social life form, is not to be blamed; but if you only work hard in form and actually do not damage the existing society at all, it becomes unacceptable.</p>
<p>Plekhanov said: "If romantic art works have gained many benefits because of their rebellion against the bourgeoisie, then on the one hand, they have suffered a lot of losses due to the actual lack of content in this rebellion." Ms. Wu is not that kind of romantic artist, but this criticism is still quite applicable to her.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Prostitution</h3>
<p>— Yao Fei</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Public Concession made a major arrest of "wild chickens" (prostitutes), the issue of prostitution has once again attracted social attention. The so-called calls for abolition of prostitution, prohibition of prostitution, rescue of prostitutes, and eradication of wild chickens have been constantly seen in major and minor newspapers. This issue was also discussed after the "May Fourth Movement," but on the point of view of abolition, prohibition, or rescue, the conclusion was consistent, but how to do it effectively has not been obtained a satisfactory answer. Now that the issue is raised again, it is not only untouched, but also becoming more serious! It is said that we are a state of etiquette and righteousness, and the authorities in the concession area are always humane. Why has it become such a serious problem that prostitution is rampant and there is no solution? This is worthy of in-depth study. For the convenience of studying the problem, let's first list a few facts:</p>
<p>1. "···Officials' entertainment, enjoying the left embrace and right hug of charming wives and concubines, is naturally limited to high-ranking officials of the first and second class. There are no public prostitutes in Nanjing, so this group of bachelors pursue private prostitutes···Secondly, it is to listen to Qingchang (singing without musical instruments). Needless to say, the drunkard's intention is not in the wine. The teahouses near the Confucius Temple are filled with petty bureaucrats from various ministries and courtyards of the government with badges after 5 o'clock. Sometimes, for the sake of supporting the corners (favorite singers), ugly dramas of jealousy and fighting occur···"</p>
<p>2. The Legislative Yuan deliberated on the amendment to the Criminal Law regarding "rape" under the crime of endangering public morals. The current law originally stipulates that raping a woman under the age of sixteen is considered rape. The amendment changed it to fourteen years old. Although it went through fierce debate, it was finally passed by a vote of 29 to 40, according to the "amendment."</p>
<p>3. "Drought is rampant in Jiangnan, and Liyang is even more barren. The poor famine victims who are waiting to be fed have no choice but to be displaced. Therefore, many women from Liyang ran to Wuxi. Because of the hunger and cold, they could not care about shame and sold their flesh, allowing wealthy men to trample on them. This aroused the anger of the pimps and brothel owners in Jiuchengli, who brazenly held a four-table meeting in the teahouse to discuss how to deal with the imported prostitutes from Liyang丨It was decided to unanimously expel the women from Liyang···"</p>
<p>4. "If parents sell their underage children to others as adopted children, unless it hinders freedom or endangers public morals, it will be punished according to the respective articles, and will not constitute endangering the family" (see Yuan Zi No. 886 explanation丨regarding the Criminal Law and seduction and abduction). Therefore, even if parents sell their daughters into prostitution, they can still be redeemed after being fined by the court! And will not be subject to legal sanctions.</p>
<p>5. All cities in the country collect "flower donations" (ie, prostitute donations). Although Nanjing nominally prohibits prostitution, the so-called "Qingchang singers" are still taxed. As for the concessions like Shanghai, brothels operate more openly! From Changsan ("(higher-class prostitutes) to wild chickens (ie, the lowest-class prostitutes), they all have their own donations!</p>
<p>6. Although the Shanghai Public Concession has made a major arrest of wild chickens this time, the police only prosecute them for "violating police regulations." The maximum fine per person is only fifteen yuan. If they cannot pay, they are changed to several days of detention, after which they are still led back by the pimps.</p>
<p>7. The law on trafficking in persons has been abolished. Whenever courts encounter cases of buying and selling people, they are generally punished under Article 257, Article 258, Article 249, and Article 315 of the Criminal Law. However, for prostitutes, in addition to being arrested and punished for violating police regulations, the prosecutors of the national courts rarely prosecute and investigate them under the above-mentioned articles (Note: "The establishment of the crime of seduction for profit does not necessarily require actual profit, and does not require a complaint, see the precedent of Shang Zi No. 989 in the seventh year!") As for the judges of the Special District Court (in the concession), they are bound by agreements. It is said that the prosecutors have no right to argue on this point!</p>
<p>From the facts listed above, we can see··</p>
<p>First, those who are intemperate in their lust and ravage and destroy women to satisfy their bestiality are all wealthy and powerful men above the level of being well-fed! (such as example one) Even ordinary people are still sex maniacs, making amulets. (such as example two) Second, women who fall into prostitution are mostly forced by hunger and cold. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have intensified the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce, causing more and more poor women to be forced into prostitution every day. (such as example three) Third, those who engage in the sex industry are recognized by the government as legitimate occupations, (such as example five) and although there are articles on the crime of seduction and abduction in the criminal law, the judges stand on the side of men's interests and do not cite them. (such as example seven) And the parents' selling of their daughters is a legitimate act of enjoying parental rights in criminal law. (such as example four) Fourth, the arrest of wild chickens in the concession is only because they violate police regulations, not for the sake of prohibiting prostitution. The pimps' operation of the sex business is protected by both Chinese and foreign officials (see examples six and seven)!</p>
<p>So we can understand··</p>
<p>1. In a patriarchal society, ravaging and destroying women and engaging in the sex industry is not only not a crime, but is actually protected by government laws!</p>
<p>2. Under the current society, it is impossible to achieve "prostitution" no matter whether it is abolition, prohibition, or rescue.</p>
<p>3. Those who patronize prostitutes are wealthy and powerful men, while those who are ravaged and destroyed are the poor women who are oppressed and exploited! In this arena, there is no so-called etiquette, righteousness, or shame, and no so-called humanity, only bestial desire, bestial desire, bestial desire!</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the emergence of prostitution has its roots in the social organization. Therefore, to solve this problem fundamentally, it is necessary to reform this society.</p>
<h3>Women's Life in Southern Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Lang Ying</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong is vast, and I am referring only to the Taishan County near the South China Sea; other counties are mostly different. Even within this small county, women's lives vary greatly, and there are things worth telling readers.</p>
<p>Taishan County is a wealthy place with a relatively developed culture. However, due to different economic factors, women's lives differ greatly. Many live comfortable lives, while many others endure painful years under the dark forces of feudalism.</p>
<p>Many men from Taishan County seek a living in Southeast Asia and the Americas, accounting for perhaps a third of the county's male population. They stay abroad for ten or eight years, or even until their death, never returning home. Therefore, their wives lead lonely lives at home. Every year, they remit large sums of money to support their families. These "Gold Mountain Sojourners" hold considerable influence in the county because they are wealthy due to the high value of American dollars. As for the "Southeast Asian Sojourners," most work as coolies abroad, earning very little money, and are mostly poor. Thus, there is a stark contrast between these two types of overseas workers, like heaven and hell. However, in the past two years, the global economic crisis has not only led to the expulsion of workers from Southeast Asia but also the same fate for Chinese immigrants in America. Unemployment is rampant, remittances have ceased, and Taishan County has become a dead county, with everything in ruins.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a saying among the villagers: "Marry your daughter to a Gold Mountain Sojourner." Every parent eagerly sought to marry their daughter to a Gold Mountain Sojourner because the bride price was high, the family was wealthy and influential, and the parents-in-law would benefit as well. Furthermore, the daughter could enjoy a life of leisure without hard labor, spending her days in idleness. Matchmakers took pride in introducing wives and concubines to Gold Mountain Sojourners. As a result, beautiful young women embarked on this path. However, they completely disregarded their daughters' lasting happiness because those who went abroad returned home only once every few years, if ever. This wasted their daughters' youth!</p>
<p>In the past, one of my cousins told me that she was also the wife of a Gold Mountain Sojourner. She said that it was best for a woman to marry a man who worked at home because living like a widow while the husband was abroad was so dull. She resolutely opposed her sisters marrying Gold Mountain Sojourners.</p>
<p>"Look, I've been wasting my youth guarding an empty house for him for three years!"</p>
<p>This was her experience. Therefore, in recent years, those who had received some education and had the courage to resist have risen up to fight for freedom and refuse to marry Gold Mountain Sojourners. They understand that money cannot console their youth. Moreover, under the constraints of traditional morality, they were not allowed to have illicit thoughts. If discovered having an affair with another man, they would be subjected to cruel punishment and then expelled, unwanted by both their husband's family and their own. Would that not lead to certain death?</p>
<p>As for the families of the working class, they can enjoy the happiness of sexual love in addition to their daily labor. Although feudal families still constrain and suppress them, preventing them from having a fulfilling life, in recent years, with the gradual spread of education, most have learned from sisters and friends to resist the oppression of feudal families and even use their authority as daughters-in-law to suppress their husbands and mothers-in-law. This form of resistance is spreading fiercely, and most of them have the authority of a mistress of the house. Other aspects of their lives are largely the same as in other places.</p>
<p>The lives of daughters and daughters-in-law in wealthy families seem particularly worth explaining. The so-called wealthy families, besides the landlords (who are mostly overseas Chinese), large merchants, and the families of overseas Chinese workers, or Gold Mountain Sojourners! They have no men at home, and the women are in charge. The children go to school. As for the daughters-in-law, their husbands leave home immediately after marriage. They guard their homes alone, and can avoid most of the labor. They have free time every day to chat with other women. However, many now attend school. Of course, they rarely do so with the intention of pursuing an education; it is merely to alleviate their year-long loneliness.</p>
<p>Therefore, many primary schools in Taishan have young married women studying alongside children. Even in middle schools, they occupy a significant number of positions. However, in any case, they cannot resolve their sexual desires and the frustration of their youth! For various reasons, news of marital infidelity, elopement, and affairs between teachers and students often surface.</p>

<h3>Selling Without Value</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Old Wu, the cabbage vendor, has been frowning and sniffling for the past few days, like a blocked chimney that can't be cleared.</p>
<p>Every day, as he pushes his empty cart home, a knot forms in his heart. Prices never seem to rise. Whether it's five or six big coins per catty, it's still ridiculously little when converted into silver dollars. Yet, six mouths are waiting to be fed at home. Old Wu always seems hesitant to say too much when buying local noodles at the rice shop, fearing a snort from the person doing the weighing.</p>
<p>"Prices were supposed to go up!"</p>
<p>Old Wu mutters to himself. Six or seven people, all with skin as yellow as paper! Suddenly, he remembers that it should be eight people, because his wife is pregnant!</p>
<p>"Eight and a half months, a little more..." Old Wu calculates in his head, touching his wife's belly. Next to him is a human ladder of heads starting from age seven.</p>
<p>"Damn it, exactly one every two years!" But when he thinks that this is "retribution for his own sins," he forces a wry smile. Only his two elderly parents, who still stand straight, make it impossible for Old Wu not to acknowledge his "blessing." Whenever anyone asks, they all exclaim, "Old Wu, you are so blessed! You have both parents!"</p>
<p>His wife is a hard worker. When she was almost eight months pregnant with their fourth child, she was still busy picking bugs and fertilizing the cabbage patch, only thinking about "setting aside some land for rapeseed." She doesn't care about the soon-to-arrive little one. Old Wu, however, is worried and feels that they cannot afford a fourth child. When his wife hesitates about this plan, Old Wu says grimly:</p>
<p>"The cabbages can't feed this bunch!" His wife looks at the human ladder beside her and can't say anything, swallowing her bitterness.</p>
<p>A few days in advance, Old Wu keeps his ears open while trading, asking if anyone wants to adopt a child. This amuses his egg-selling and pancake-selling companions.</p>
<p>"It would be best if I could give away my fourth kid too!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, one every two years! I don't have that much energy!" The one with the flat nose chimes in, "Old Wu, you're getting what you deserve!"</p>
<p>Old Wu pushes his cabbage cart away a few steps, avoiding the ridicule. At this moment, he's not in the mood for jokes, carrying a mountain of sorrow.</p>
<p>The child finally arrives right on time, only a bit skinny, with little hands like chicken claws. Seeing that it's a boy, Old Wu feels a bit relieved, as it will give him some convenience.</p>
<p>The next day, just as dawn breaks, he puts the child on the cabbage cart, covering it with a blue cloth. The child is very well-behaved, lying there without a sound, as the cart moves forward. When Old Wu, with a bitter tone, calls out to his companions and reveals the blue cloth, the child's little eyes are slightly narrowed.</p>
<p>"Anyone want him?" Old Wu asks softly. Then again, "Anyone want him?"...</p>
<h3>Law and Us</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>There is an old Chinese saying, "There are rulers, but no laws to rule by." Modern scholars advocate that there is no problem with people, but the law must be carefully considered. This spirit of the rule of law is a great step forward. With this progress, gender equality has become a settled matter. If you compare the current laws with the laws of the Great Qing Dynasty, the increase in the status of women is not something that ignorant villagers can easily accept, and even modern scholars will be amazed.</p>
<p>Many provisions in the current laws on women's rights are even more advanced than those in Western European countries, which is truly something to be grateful for. However, the gratitude is for the future, for the day when these laws are fully implemented. As for the present, many bad facts stain the dignity of the law. For example, the prohibition of human trafficking is clearly stipulated in the current criminal law, but there are unscrupulous and poor people who risk being punished and sell their wives and daughters. The concubines and prostitutes everywhere are all bought and sold. This can be said to be ordinary small households. As for the case of Bao Zhang, the daughter of the late Marshal Zhang Zuolin, who caused a sensation in Tianjin and Beijing some time ago, who abused her maid to death, it shows that even aristocratic families who abide by etiquette and laws also engage in such behavior. It can be seen that there are too many unscrupulous people who sell their wives and daughters, and what can be done if good families do not buy them? At this time, the law itself has to swallow its anger.</p>
<p>Recently, the Legislative Yuan is amending the law. Regarding morality, the draft amendment has included a clause to punish married men who commit adultery with others, but it was opposed and deleted by a majority of committee members at yesterday's meeting. Also, the current criminal law stipulates that raping a girl under the age of sixteen is considered rape, while the amendment reduces it to fourteen; after a series of enthusiastic debates by the committee members, it was finally passed and established. In the future, married men who rape young girls over the age of fourteen who do not have husbands should have no other problems. This should be attributed to the fruitful results of Women's Year.</p>
<p>In recent years, the decadent life in big cities has stimulated the sexual knowledge of young girls, resulting in the possibility of precocity. However, most of the girls who are raped, such as child prostitutes, child laborers, and maids, come from simple and poor villages. How can they talk about development before the age of sixteen? However, times have created so many eager young men in the city, who need them to make significant progress in their development. If girls over the age of fourteen become disabled or die from being raped in the future, it is destined.</p>
<p>Measure! Everything depends on measuring one's own strength. The principle of equality between men and women has been practiced for twenty years, but women do not have organizations or the ability to struggle, and the situation is still like this! The law is like the sun floating in the sky. Even if there is universal light, you must stand on a corner of the ground, not be trampled under the feet of others, before you can see it. Therefore, even if there are laws that absolutely guarantee gender equality, can women's liberation be said to be possible? Moreover, the current law is still in this state?</p>

<h3>Truth</h3>
<p>— Zhi Ming</p>
<p>The sun, the earth, water, the entire universe, and the entire natural world all exist concretely and objectively, which no one can deny. Human thought is a reflection of objective things. Only when objective things have their real existence can we recognize the truth, and therefore the truth exists in our consciousness. The subjective truth in human consciousness is a reflection of objective truth, but objective truth exists independently of our ideas and is real. The general metaphysicians deny the real existence of objective things, deny objective truth, and think that truth is entirely the product of human subjectivity, that objective things depend on human ideas, which is entirely a manifestation of beliefism. If so, then where do human ideas come from? What do objective things that existed before the appearance of human beings depend on? I am afraid that this can only be answered according to the principle of "God created all things," which is extremely mysterious!</p>
<p>Ulyanov said: "......The denial of objective truth is agnosticism and also subjectivism." The absurdity of this denial of objective truth can be clearly seen by considering the following truth examples from the history of natural science. Natural science affirms that the earth existed long before human beings appeared, and there is no room for doubt about this truth. From the perspective of materialist epistemology, the proposition that the represented exists independently of the representation (the independence of the external world from consciousness) is very consistent with scientific truth. In fact, the principle that the external world is independent of human consciousness is the fundamental proposition of materialism. The fact that the earth existed before human beings appeared is indeed said by science to be an objective truth. This position is incompatible with Mahha philosophy and its theory of truth. Because, if truth is an organized form of human experience, then any claim that the earth existed before there was any human experience cannot be considered truth." The so-called "truth is an organized form of human experience" by general empirical critics, like the theologians and idealists who say that truth is ordained by God or is the product of human subjectivity, both deny the existence of objective truth, and are mysterious and unreasonable statements, the only difference being in the terms they use.</p>
<p>Since truth exists objectively, it naturally has its absoluteness. Whether in the natural world or in human society, in a certain time and space, there must be a form of existence of things, and this form of existence is not abstractly from fantasy, but concretely and objectively exists, and therefore is an undeniable absolute truth. Although reptiles only exist in a certain period of the earth's entire history, it is always an undeniable truth that there were reptiles in a period after the earth was formed. Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss was assassinated in Vienna in 1934, which, although not a great event, is indeed an undeniable fact in the historical process of mankind: truth. Therefore, we say that in the sense that things exist objectively and absolutely, truth has its absoluteness. If the absoluteness of truth is denied, the result can only be to go into the world of theology 丨</p>
<p>However, everything is in constant motion and change, and the absolute existence of things is limited by time and space, so the absoluteness of truth must also be limited by time and space 丨丨Absolute truth beyond time and space is not</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>will not be. It is an absolute truth to say that there were reptiles in a certain period in the history of the earth, but it is a big mistake to say that this thing exists at any time. The earth exists in a certain period of the universe's existence, and it does not exist outside this period. Therefore, it is an absolute truth to say that there is an earth in a certain period of the universe's existence, but if it is said that there is an earth in any period of the universe's existence, then truth becomes a fallacy. In human society, truth is not only limited by time and space, but also has different truths in different groups of people. Obviously, the asceticism of Christianity was regarded as truth and supported by people in the Middle Ages, but who still recognizes this as truth today? Killing is certainly wrong in our modern eyes, but the Eskimos of Green Island, who are attacked by periodic hunger, have the habit of killing the sick and elderly, and think this is a good thing. 丨丨丨In this way, like the absoluteness of truth, truth also has relativity. Because things really exist, truth has absoluteness; because things are constantly changing and their existence is limited by time and space, truth also has relativity. Therefore, truth is both absolute and relative.</p>
<p>Because things exist for sure and are constantly changing, and both "existing for sure" and "constantly changing" are the essence of things, the absolute truth and relative truth that depend on this are not absolutely opposed. Without absolute truth, there is no relative truth, and relative truth is the product of the accumulation of absolute truth; conversely, without relative truth, there will be no absolute truth, and absolute truth is formed by relative truth. Therefore, absolute truth and relative truth are both contradictory and unified, having their contradictory unity and their unified contradiction.</p>
<p>In short, truth is concrete. Whether objective truth or subjective truth, whether absolute truth or relative truth, all have concrete existing things as their basis, and are not abstract fantasies. The sun and the earth, feudal society and Christianity, Napoleon and Dollfuss, certainly exist in the universe and the historical process of mankind, so we can say that this existence is truth, otherwise it is wrong. This is 丨丨our explanation of truth.</p>

<h3>Physical Strength and Career</h3>
<p>— Yin Xin</p>
<p>丨丨Two Interesting Statistics 丨丨</p>
<p>People who can handle big things must first have overflowing energy. Otherwise, when the opportunity comes, they will eventually be unable to cope with extraordinary opportunities due to their own mental weakness and decline. Like Bismarck, when concluding the peace treaty, someone said of him: "Bismarck's appearance in military uniform was burly, but when talking to him, he saw a white-haired, old and swaying old man. Therefore, observing the strength and weakness of his appearance, the number of wins and losses has been determined."</p>
<p>A Western proverb says: "A sound mind is in a sound body." Those with magnificent bodies must have more energy. Someone in the United States once studied the "relationship between the body and the human body" and surveyed the height and weight of leaders from all walks of life in the country, and made two very interesting statistics:</p>
<p>The height of forty leaders is as follows:</p>
<p>Category　Average Height</p>
<p>(in English inches</p>
<p>Calculate the decimals, which indicate the</p>
<p>Indicate the number of inches)</p>
<p>Reformer　5, 11, 4</p>

<p>Warden　5, 11, 3</p>
<p>Governor　5, 11, 2</p>
<p>Police Chief　5, 11, 1</p>
<p>Socialist Organizer　5, 10, 9</p>
<p>Railway President　5, 10, 9 University President　5, 10, 8</p>
<p>Economist　5, 10, 8</p>
<p>Sociologist</p>
<p>Bank President　5, 10, 7</p>
<p>Senator　5, 10, 6</p>
<p>Bishop　5, 10, 6</p>
<p>President of the Bar Association　5, 10, 5</p>
<p>Municipal School Superintendent　5, 10, 4</p>
<p>Union Leader　5, 10, 4</p>
<p>Church President　5, 10, 4</p>
<p>Company President　5, 10, 4</p>
<p>Prohibitionist　5, 10, 3</p>

<p>World Labor Party　5, 10, 3</p>
<p>Inventor　5, 10, 2</p>
<p>Author　5, 10, 2</p>
<p>Sales Manager　5, 10, 1</p>
<p>Artist　5, 10, 1</p>
<p>Mayor　5, 10, 0</p>
<p>Factory Supervisor　5, 9, 8</p>
<p>Insurance Manager　5, 9, 7</p>
<p>Psychologist　5, 9, 7</p>
<p>Charity President　5, 9, 6</p>
<p>Court President　5, 9, 6</p>
<p>Philosopher　5, 9, 6</p>
<p>Merchant　5, 9, 4</p>
<p>Roundhouse Supervisor　5, 9, 3</p>
<p>Prohibition Officer　5, 9, 2</p>
<p>Lecturer　5, 9, 2</p>
<p>Manufacturer　5, 9, 0</p>
<p>Organizer of the Labor Party　5, 8, 2</p>
<p>Publisher　5, 7, 9</p>
<p>Musician　5, 5, 6</p>
<p>From this statistic, we can undoubtedly see two points: First, most leaders from all walks of life are tall and strong. Among them, administrative leaders are the most prominent; second, intellectual superiors such as artists, inventors, and authors are not as tall as administrative leaders.</p>
<p>Also, the weight of forty leaders is statistically analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Category　Average Weight</p>
<p>(in pounds)</p>
<p>Street Cleaning Supervisor　216.7</p>
<p>Police Chief　202.4</p>
<p>Warden　191.2</p>
<p>Charity President　190.4</p>
<p>Fire Chief　189.4</p>
<p>YMCA Officer　188.6</p>
<p>Bank President　186.8</p>
<p>Factory Supervisor　186.7</p>
<p>Union Leader　186.3</p>
<p>Organizer of the Labor Party　186.1</p>
<p>Senator　185.0</p>
<p>Prohibitionist　184.9</p>
<p>Sales Manager　182.8</p>
<p>World Labor Party　182.2</p>
<p>Governor　182.0</p>
<p>Reformer　181.7</p>
<p>University President　181.6</p>
<p>Company Manager　179.8</p>
<p>Municipal School Superintendent　178.6</p>
<p>Roundhouse Supervisor　177.0</p>
<p>Mayor　176.9</p>
<p>Bishop　176.4</p>
<p>Prohibition Officer　176.3</p>
<p>Insurance Manager　175.2</p>
<p>Publisher　171.9</p>
<p>President of the Bar Association　171.5</p>
<p>Socialist Organizer　171.0</p>
<p>Economist Sociologist　170.8</p>
<p>Church President　169.8</p>
<p>Inventor　169.4</p>
<p>Court President　169.0</p>
<p>Artist　165.7</p>
<p>Merchant　163.7</p>
<p>Lecturer　162.3</p>
<p>Musician　161.9</p>
<p>Philosopher　158.4</p>
<p>Author　158.4</p>
<p>Psychologist　155.3</p>
<p>From the above table, the weight of leaders from all walks of life can be said to be on the normal level. Also, administrative leaders are often heavier than intellectual leaders, which is also due to the suitability of each to their duties.</p>
<p>A person's weight and height are not necessarily directly proportional to the success of their career. For example, the average height of the court president is five feet nine inches and six, which is more than one inch different from the average height of the warden, which is five feet eleven inches and three. The warden is truly magnificent, but is the court president inferior to the warden? Also, psychologists, authors, philosophers, etc., have the lowest weight, but such as Darwin, Spencer, world teachers, and the admiration of all, their physical strength is not necessarily the most impressive.</p>
<p>That being said, people with weight and height are actually more suitable for achieving career success.</p>
<p>The weight and height of the body are inherited from nature and also depend on acquired training. People with short statures can also be trained to be capable people. Napoleon was a short but capable man, so he is still a generation of eccentrics.</p>
<p>— Training and Cultivation</p>
<h3>From Yang Zhu's and Mo Di's Thoughts to the Cultivation of Youth</h3>
<p>— Xiong Shi</p>
<p>Mencius was most opposed to Yang Zhu and Mo Di, but I advise people to be like Mo Di if possible, and if not, then at least like Yang Zhu. Now I will study the thoughts of Yang Zhu and the Mohists, which will prove Mencius's biased criticism to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(1) Yang Zhu's Passive Thought</p>
<p>First, Yang Zhu advocated "not harming others for self-interest." Mencius attacked Yang Zhu by taking out of context the phrase "he would not pluck out a single hair to benefit the world." In fact, in the Yang Zhu chapter, the sentence "he would not pluck out a single hair to benefit the world" is clearly followed by the sentence "he would not take the whole world for himself." Yang Zhu's saying coincides with Yi Yin's saying, "He would not give a single mote to others, nor would he take a single mote from others." However, Mencius respected Yi Yin but belittled Yang Zhu.</p>
<p>"Not harming others for self-interest" is indeed a passive thought, but observing that people inevitably harm others in order to achieve their own interests, most of the harmful behaviors in the world are nothing more than due to "self-interest," and the world is therefore full of troubles.</p>
<p>Second, Yang Zhu opposed "fame." "Fame" and "reality" are indeed two different things. Those who enjoy empty fame do not necessarily have "reality," and those who have "reality" do not necessarily have "fame." Therefore, Yang Zhu said, "Fame has no reality, and reality has no fame."</p>
<p>In society, it is common to see certain matters where "famous people" are listed, or "famous people" write inscriptions. The general public is often fooled by the "fame" of "famous people" and suffers endless harm as a result. Therefore, Confucius in the Analects explained "famous people" as "seizing fame and acting contrary to it." What famous people can do is to engage in superficial work to gain empty fame.</p>
<p>Thinking calmly, if every member of society today could avoid pursuing empty fame and instead engage in practical work, how could the world be so chaotic?</p>
<p>(2) The Mohists' Active Thought</p>
<p>The Mohists' thought is contained in the book Mozi, but the text is obscure, and even today, not everything has been explained. In summary, its essence can be divided into three parts: (1) universal love, non-aggression, and defense; (2) frugality; (3) disciplined living.</p>
<p>First, universal love, non-aggression, and defense.</p>
<p>(A) Mencius used Mozi's universal love as an excuse to condemn him. Mencius believed that Mozi "treats his own parents the same as other people's parents," which is "being without a father." In fact, this criticism is extremely unfair. It should be known that all evils in the world originate from "discrimination." Because there is a concept of "self" and "others," all evils arise from this. Whenever there is a conflict of interest, either others are sacrificed for self-interest, or oneself is sacrificed to benefit others. If the "discrimination" between "self" and "others" cannot be eliminated, then stealing from others' families to benefit one's own family, and destroying other people's countries to benefit one's own country, the source of all disasters in the world will never be eradicated.</p>
<p>(B) Mozi advocated non-aggression. In the chaotic state of the Warring States period, where warlords were fighting for supremacy, people were killed in cities and fields, and the land was full of devastation, the scene was utterly desolate. However, the general view was that killing one person was a crime, but killing for the country was a merit. To use an analogy, if we consider one piece of chalk to be white, but a box of chalk to be black, isn't that a ridiculously wrong conclusion? Killing one person should be punished, and killing a hundred people should be punished even more. This is Mozi's argument for "non-aggression" on a logical level.</p>
<p>(C) Defense. During the Warring States period, Song Guo also advocated the idea of abolishing war. The so-called abolishing war is the same as the current League of Nations, the Hague International Court, etc., which only try to persuade people to cease fighting from a moral standpoint, but ultimately there is no solution. Mozi saw through this point and argued that there must be a backing (i.e., defense) before one can talk about non-aggression. At that time, Gongshu Ban built flying kites and cloud ladders to help Chu attack Song. Mozi traveled ten days and ten nights from Lu to Chu to discuss the techniques of attack and defense with Gongshu Ban, and Chu then stopped the plan to attack Song. Therefore, it is said that the heart of non-aggression must be able to defend. This is Mozi's opposition to war on a technical level.</p>
<p>Second, Mozi advocated frugality.</p>
<p>(A) Frugal use. In the world, although there are people who "cannot eat," there are also many people who "have nothing to eat." Mozi advocated frugal use. His standard was "to stop when it is enough to provide for the people's use," that is, to limit oneself to the minimum necessary for living. If one eats too much and excessively, it is stealing food from others in addition to one's own share. "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death" is a depiction of this situation. Therefore, Mozi wanted people to abolish unnecessary tasks and those who enjoy excessively should practice frugality.</p>
<p>(B) Frugal burial. In ancient times, it was common to bury precious objects with the dead, burying wealth that could be used for production, and even causing disasters of overturning coffins and exposing corpses, which was an extremely unconscious act. Because of this extravagant custom, the poor had to leave their ancestors exposed without burial for generations. Mozi strongly opposed extravagance and showing off wealth, saying that "a three-inch coffin is enough to rot the body, and three layers of clothing are enough to cover the ugliness." This is the Mohist advocacy of frugal burial.</p>
<p>(C) Abolishing music. Originally, music is the best way to cultivate emotions and regulate temperament, but why did Mozi abolish music? Mozi lived in a chaotic world, and the "music" of the Warring States period must have been similar to the decadent music we hear today! Every morning, when we walk down the street, the radios in the shops are playing "Good baby, go to sleep." I ask, what benefit does this decadent and addictive music have for the body and mind?</p>
<p>Third, disciplined living</p>
<p>The spirit of the Mohists lies in discipline and seriousness. The religious leader of the Mohists was called the Giant, who had supreme authority. There was a Giant named "Fu" who had only one son. The son committed murder, and the ruler of Song said: "Your son should die for murder, but considering that you have only one son, I have ordered a general amnesty." But the Giant said: "Although the king has pardoned him, the Mohist 'whoever kills must die' is an iron discipline. If he does not die, then the law will not be enforced," so he killed his son. Also, Yangcheng Jun had a friend who was a Giant, who gave him a talisman to guard the city. Yangcheng Jun went on an expedition, but Yangcheng was besieged by Chu. The Giant was determined to defend Yangcheng to the death. His disciples advised him, saying: "It is a useless sacrifice to lose your life, which will cut off the Mohist lineage, and it will not benefit Yangcheng. Why not abandon the city and flee?" But the Giant said: "Yangcheng Jun has entrusted me with an important task. If I abandon the city and flee, from now on, everyone will think that there are no loyal and trustworthy people in the Mohist school. People will no longer seek help from the Mohist school. This is tantamount to cutting off the Mohist life." So the Giant and all the disciples died defending Yangcheng. This spirit of "going through fire and water without turning back" cannot be achieved by empty "training." Only by one's own spiritual expression and extreme self-suffering can one have subsequent disciples.</p>
<p>(3) Conclusion</p>
<p>Mozi used an active spirit and extreme self-suffering to save people and the world, which is truly a model for us. But if one cannot achieve that, then Yang Zhu's passive not harming others for self-interest, not pursuing empty fame, and valuing reality is already more than enough to save oneself. It is hoped that ambitious young people will choose carefully.</p>

<p>Life</p>
<h3>Cart Pullers</h3>
<p>— Changfa</p>
<p>We often see a kind of clumsy and heavy giant cart near the shipping docks, train stations, and factories. It is loaded with various goods stacked like houses, and several people, who look strong but are not very healthy, push and pull it to who knows where. This kind of cart is called a "collapsing cart," and the people who push and pull it are naturally called "cart pullers."</p>
<p>The structure of this kind of collapsing cart is extremely simple: two clumsy iron wheels clamp a very sturdy axle, which is covered with a wooden bed that is more than ten feet long and quite thick. On both sides of the cart bed, close to the wheels, there are two long and thick cart posts. Under the cart bed, there is a small, unlidded cabinet for storing miscellaneous items. The structure of the cart posts is relatively ingenious. They are divided into two sections. When not needed, they can be removed. When there are many goods occupying a large area, they can be reinstalled to carry more goods.</p>
<p>The way cart pullers use the collapsing cart is for people to pull in front and people to push in the back. There is no fixed number of people pulling. Most of the time, the number of people needed depends on the weight of the goods. But usually there cannot be fewer than three people (even an empty cart needs two people to pull), because the goods transported by cart pullers are definitely not small or light. Without considerable manpower, you cannot move them a hair. It is very common to have four or five people pulling. It is less common to have twenty or thirty people pulling.</p>
<p>The people pushing are like the helmsmen on a ship. Although they also have to use a lot of strength, having too many people hinders and is not very convenient. Usually one or two people are enough. The collapsing cart originally focuses on pulling (this is similar to the "rickshaw"), which is what differentiates it from ordinary handcarts and small carts.</p>
<p>The cart pullers exert great effort to send the goods to distant warehouses, factories, workshops, shops... Sweat drips from their brows, they breathe in the smog of the city, and they move forward panting... This is not the most difficult page in their lives; it is even an opportunity for them to chat and rest. At this time, they can browse the scenery on the road and talk casually with each other.</p>
<p>The most torturous thing for them, requiring them to exert the most strength, is the loading and unloading of goods. There are often some incredibly heavy and strangely shaped goods in the loading trains and ship cargo holds. When the trains or ships arrive at the dock, they stubbornly demand that they use huge amounts of labor to deal with them. There is naturally another group of dockworkers at the dock who handle the unloading of goods, but the bosses of the cart pulling companies (most of these people have relationships with transportation agencies) also instruct their subordinates to engage in arduous labor when there is money to be made. As for customers coming to "pick up goods," the laborious work of loading the goods onto the cart undoubtedly falls on them. The goods in the warehouse are piled high like mountains: they have to carry the "mountainous" goods one package, one basket, one box, one bundle, one bag, one strip, one piece at a time onto their carts (many goods are transported by freight cars): the heavy load of three to four hundred catties ruthlessly presses on their backs, forcing them to hum simple lyrics of "hmm ha ha, ha ha ha" from their windpipes in order to reduce the unbearable pressure on their backs. Some goods that cannot be dropped heavily, such as glass, porcelain, medicine, and some other boxed goods, cannot be dropped immediately and require them to stop and endure for a certain period of time: in this case, they have to grit their teeth and wait for other companions to rescue them. Sweat beads the size of broad beans drip from their faces. A boundless cloud of fatigue and pain envelops their entire bodies. Wiping the sweat from their foreheads with their sleeves and exhaling a breath, they have to start over and continue the unfinished work!</p>
<p>Most of their work is harmful to their health. This is not because I am worried about them carrying three to four hundred catties on their backs, but because this work is inherently detrimental to health. Any kind of goods, especially powdery ones such as flour and incense powder, will immediately create a fog of powder around you as soon as you move them, and immediately spread throughout the entire cargo room: anyone working in the cargo room breathes in this fog of powder and coughs up a thick phlegm from their mouths that is not white, not yellow, not black, and also white, also yellow, also black. Their faces and bodies are also covered by this fog of powder, making it difficult to distinguish where their eyes are and where their noses are, and it is also impossible to tell whether the clothes you are wearing are white or black. In addition, goods that can be dropped heavily, such as bags of melon seeds, peanuts, soybeans, mung beans, sesame, wheat, and some cloth, yarn, velvet, wool, etc., will inevitably create a cloud of dust that takes the opportunity to fly around and surround the people working. Fortunately, they are small workers who do not understand and do not pay attention to hygiene and do not care about these things at all.</p>
<p>They work so hard, but the rewards they receive are very limited. Usually, for transporting goods for customers, the price is mostly calculated per piece. The heavier the goods and the farther the distance, the higher the price will naturally be. Generally, for delivering goods weighing two to three hundred catties a short distance, the price is generally from two to three corners per piece. For long distances and heavy goods, there are also prices of five to seven corners per piece. There are also all-inclusive deliveries, and the price is naturally not fixed. Cart pullers cannot say a word when negotiating prices. They are employed by the boss, and the boss is responsible for everything externally. They work hard and get wages from the boss. There is no fixed amount of wages. It depends on how much business the boss does each day. It is very good if the boss divides the money he gets from the customers in half with them. Usually it is more of a 40/60 or 30/70 split, and some even have a 20/80 split. Not long ago, I saw in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao that there was a cart pulling boss in Tianjin who transported goods for a flour mill and the carters were dissatisfied with the 20/80 split. Actually, the average cart puller earns no more than ten dollars a month, and they have to pay for their own food.</p>
<p>They sometimes have some extra income. Customers sometimes need to "weigh" the goods in the warehouse, and they can get five to ten cents for weighing one piece for the customer. This money is naturally also divided with the boss. Sometimes, if some edible goods, such as melon seeds and peanuts, are accidentally dropped, they can sweep them up semi-publicly or secretly and take them home. The rules in the warehouse are very strict, and although thefts do sometimes occur, anyone who is caught will be fired immediately, so not many people dare to try it.</p>

<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>A Talk on Dental Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Huang Bingji</p>
<p>Dental hygiene is concerned with the health of the teeth and the various tissues in the mouth, so that the various organs in the body can function normally and be nourished constantly. An unclean mouth is the only cause of harm to human health. Countless microorganisms in the air are exhaled from the mouth and become serious diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, scarlet fever, tonsillitis, laryngitis, and colds. Therefore, an unclean mouth is the mouth of disease. A person with a healthy mouth will never have disease. Conversely, a sick person will never have a healthy mouth.</p>
<p>The level of civilization of a country and its people can be inferred from the sales of toothbrushes. Therefore, the famous Black scholar "Washington" once said: "The toothbrush is the greatest tool for promoting civilization." He once encouraged students to develop the habit of cleaning their teeth, so that they would love themselves and promote civilization. His intention was truly far-reaching. Clean teeth never decay, but an unclean mouth will cause teeth to decay. Further, the pulp will be exposed, causing extreme pain. If one is not careful, a tooth abscess will form, which is not only unbearably painful, but will also become an acute blood poisoning that can lead to death. Is that not frightening? Swelling of the gums is also caused by the formation of tartar and the accumulation of food debris, which gradually inflames the membrane of the tooth root, followed by the outflow of pus, resulting in the loss of teeth. Other diseases such as stomatitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and all diseases, are caused by uncleanliness in the mouth.</p>
<p>Recently, the author examined students at maritime schools and found that among 3,368 boys and girls, only 23% had healthy teeth and 70% had decayed teeth. Is this not alarming? According to reports from the U.S. Army and Navy recruiting offices, countless good soldiers could not serve because of dental defects. In 1917, 19% of those who applied for the army also failed due to unhealthy teeth. During my six-year internship in Chicago, I saw that Chinese children and adults there also suffered from the same disease. Ninety percent of elderly people suffered from various periodontal abscesses, and some had severe conditions, with tooth bones gradually breaking and falling out, all because of ignorance that led them into hell. Only young students paid relatively close attention to their teeth.</p>
<p>Oral hygiene from the time a baby is born until the milk teeth are all out is very important. More infants die from improper feeding than from any other cause. Therefore, before the salivary glands and teeth have developed, no food other than milk is suitable. When the baby first starts eating solid food, the mother and wet nurse must pay extra attention to the cleanliness of the mouth. The method is to wrap a piece of medicated cotton wool on a thoroughly cleaned right thumb, soak it in borax acid, take it out and put it in the mouth, move it over the top of the tongue, and especially scrub under the tongue and between the gums and teeth. After all the teeth have come out, brush the teeth three or four times a day with a soft brush. If the child is sick, even more attention must be paid to the mouth, as countless microorganisms will breed at this time and lead to disaster.</p>
<p>Permanent teeth are gradually formed around the ages of six to eleven, as the milk teeth gradually fall out due to the contraction of the tooth roots. Children between the ages of three and six should avoid excessive stimulation from objects or inadequate nutrition, as the permanent teeth are in the developing stage, the child's energy is reduced, and nervous system diseases are easily prevalent. Many children become vicious because of stimulation from oral diseases, decayed teeth, and disabilities. How can one not be careful? From a psychological point of view, uneven teeth, crooked jaws, and cleft lips can make lively children lose their happiness and turn their lovable personalities into violent and cruel ones due to ridicule from their peers.</p>
<p>From this point of view, oral hygiene is really important. For cleaning, prepare a good toothbrush, a piece of silk floss, a tongue scraper, and clean water. When brushing your teeth, you must take care of both the inside and outside of the upper and lower teeth. Silk floss is only used to remove food debris, and toothpicks can also be used, but they should not damage the tissue of the gums.</p>
<p>Children should be taught to breathe through their noses, as improper breathing easily leads to throat diseases, tonsillitis, colds, laryngitis, and tuberculosis, and the unhealthiness of the chewing apparatus makes it difficult to digest the food, leading to diseases of the stomach and intestines.</p>
<p>We must know that good blood comes from good food, but it must go through proper chewing, digestion, melting, and acidification. Without healthy teeth, proper chewing cannot be done; without proper chewing, food is not easily digested; without fresh air, food is difficult to combine with oxygen. Therefore, health is the way to increase happiness: if people can find the way to health, it is truly better than ascending to paradise.</p>
<h3>Opposition</h3>
<p>— A K</p>
<p>Recent news from the Shanghai Esperanto Association: The Shanghai Esperanto Association is one of the few academic groups in the country. Established more than two years ago, its affairs are very developed, with more than a thousand members and footprints all over China and abroad. Recently, the association held its third member congress to discuss new guidelines for the 1935 World Esperanto Congress and other important matters. The association recently launched an excursion to the suburbs. Dozens of male and female members took a bus to Wusong and Baoshan, enjoying the scenery along the way and distributing pamphlets, which aroused the interest of people from all walks of life in Esperanto. It is also heard that the association has held many Esperanto training classes, cultivating many Esperanto teachers. The ninth training class is scheduled to begin in early November, with a duration of two months and a tuition fee of only three yuan. Those who aspire to learn this language of the new era can directly contact the association at Yongpingfang, Carter Road to obtain the charter and register.</p>

<p>Yao Xiao praises Pang Xueqing's Pearl Pagoda 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Longing"</p>
<p>Autumn clouds are light, chrysanthemums are fragrant. Osmanthus branches are withered, yellowing the ground. They say the scenery of Changshan is good. Western River willows obscure the canvas window. All one sees is the young Miss Shanci leaning languidly against the catalpa bed. Thinking all day long among the gorgeous flowers. Remembering past events, her heart is secretly wounded. She remembers last year, midsummer near Duanwu. They met suddenly next to the peony. By the lotus pond, their words were sweet. Amber cups were always filled with turmeric liquor. Under the rose flowers, they expressed their longing. Hoping to be a couple forever, like the white-headed old man. Unexpectedly, the gentleman has lofty ambitions. Joining the Sichuan army to go to the battlefield. Now, agarwood has fallen and jade has perished. Forcing me to drift aimlessly like duckweed all my life. Red flowers have been thrown away, and she is too lazy to dress up. Listening to the endless crying of the cuckoos outside the door. The rain on the banana leaves at night is the most heartbreaking. How can one bear to live alone and be even more desolate.</p>

<p>Radio News</p>
<p>Only spoken drama occupies an educational component in current Chinese radio. It can also be said that it proves that not all radio programs are a numbing form of leisurely literature. Here, let me introduce the figures in this spoken drama troupe first: I want to introduce the Guanyin Drama Society. When we close our eyes, we can imagine their forms on the stage. Chen Dabei has been working hard in the drama movement since the Chunqie Society before the Republic of China era. With his chubby figure and amiable demeanor, although he is a bit old, he is still so energetic, continuing to work hard on his ideal career of drama. Cang Yinqiu is a historical figure in the Guanyin Society. She certainly has a very good grasp of her experience broadcasting spoken dramas. Although she is only an experienced film worker, she certainly has a gifted ideology when playing silly older sisters.</p>
<p>Gu Wenzong, we are old friends. He has been performing children's dramas since he was a child. His drama knowledge is increasing with his age. Now, we can often see his achievements on the screen. He is a short, chubby fellow.</p>
<p>Liu Yile was not originally prepared to show off his skills in front of the microphone, nor was he prepared to show off on the screen. He just did what he could. The impression on the stage can never be erased from my mind. The passion of the article makes me still interested when I reopen it. However, he was very unfortunate and once lived in the Public Security Bureau Hotel for two months.</p>
<p>Jingya, this girl is worthy of being loved. The dignity of a pure virgin will make people feel a kind of mysterious imagination. At the same time, her life is also very serious. In addition to serving the public for education in the broadcasting room, in another time, in another place, she is doing another meaningful job.</p>
<p>Since broadcasting Li Changjian's news drama, the local Yuanchang Radio Station has been deeply welcomed by the audience. Therefore, Li Changjian's storytelling program was added from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM in the evening. Because the weather is getting colder, the evening program will be temporarily suspended. However, due to audience requests, there are hundreds of them every day, so it is specially scheduled to broadcast news dramas for three days from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM every night, and the station's director Zhang Tijun will be in charge of the dubbing. The station's frequency is 1120.</p>
<p>Mail on Behalf: To Mr. Yuan Jinru, your letter has been received. Due to space constraints, this publication was unable to comply. We apologize and will consider it in the future.</p>
<p>Sincerely, the Broadcasting Program Editing Office</p>
