<p>自本埠公共租界工部局人力車管理委員會頒布領照新章後。人力車同業公會。卽揚言反抗。循至最近。風潮擴大。情形嚴重。此事有關於十四萬平民之衣食生計。洵堪注意。按照工部局决議。自八月份起凡請領人力車執照者。均須先將管理委員會所發之車主證書呈請查騐。而在領取車主證書前。則應聲明情願遵守新章。新章内容。係根據工部局人力車委員會之建議第四欵至第十六欵。而經該局董事會議議决者。言其概要。則爲（一）從速實行照主登記册。（二）創辦車夫登記制度。（三）規定公用人力車租最多每廿四小時小洋八角。（四）規定車資。每英里小洋二角。每小時小洋六角（五）取締野鷄包車。此次反抗風潮。實由車商組織之同業公會爲主體。而細察新章項目。與車商最有切膚利害關關係者。則僅爲照主登記與車租减低之二項而已。</p>
<p>吾人在討論兹事是非之前。應先承認現行人力車制度及人力車夫生活確有改良之必要。但工部局與同業公會對於改良之方針。則顯相廻異。據工部局之觀察。現行制度之缺點。大半因執照操於少數人之手。任其壟斷。遂使一籌莫展之車夫。被人利用。而無可奈何。聞自一九二四年起。該局爲管理交通起見。將執照數目加以限制以來。卽發生三種主要弊端。卽（一）執照之持有人。因此得有壟斷價值。并使車夫出頗高之租價。（二）發生「野鷄」包車。（三）使公共租界内之人力車式樣較遜於其他城市。是以工部局新章之主要對象。在於取締執照之非法壟斷。非法賣買。而在人力車委員會報告書中目爲控制執照買賣及轉讓之同業公會。遂致首當其衝。反之。同業公會則僅肯承認「車商因故改業將車輛出賣有之。但絶不應有僅將執照作買賣等情。「（見本報三月二十一日殷芝齡氏談話。）此言而確。則反對照主登記。似有無的放矢之嫌。此點本爲事實問題。絶不能勉强掩飾也。</p>
<p>吾人以爲同業公會及一般車商。旣不承認有賣買執照情事。則反對新章之主要理由。惟在車租减低之一端。然按諸實際。减租一事亦儘有商量之餘地。聞工部局方面。本定七月一日起减租至每日小洋八角。嗣經展緩由八月一日起。改爲每日小洋十角。明年一月一日起。始减爲八角。可見局方並未堅持原議。而同業公會方面。亦承認有酌减車租之必要。並曾上書工部避。擬减至小洋十二角。足徵雙方對於現行車租。皆覺太重。所差者。在於减少之數量。而非爲减少之原則。此後誠能設法廢除包頭制度。由車夫直接向車行拉車。車行固可遵守新章。而無所困難。在車夫亦始可享受實惠。</p>
<p>由是觀之。此次人力車風潮。照理不至於發生。其所以至於醞釀迄今。甚至於有猛烈爆發之虞者。或者雙方猶未能相見以誠。而工部局對於改革方案之進行。操之太急。亦未能諱言。卽如同業公會表示。欲求包頭制度之廢除。不可不先改良車夫生活。使其脱離包頭之經濟關係乃可。自爲切要之談。如不此之圖。而高談减低車租。必不能廢除車商與包頭之契約。而車夫或至無車可拉。亦正爲意中事也。</p>
<p>總之。吾人爲十四萬平民之生計及社會安寗秩序計。切盼雙方勿走極端。各以妥恊精神而謀最後之轉圜也。</p>

<p>昨夜警察得報、國社黨預備二次起事、因此維也納又宣布戒嚴、高級警官告美聯社訪員稱、全國警察準備動員、以防止上星期之事變、再在斯狄里亞及其他各省發生云、</p>

<p>希特勒氏與反對共和政體之中、有根本之異點、彼不僅向共和政體、而深知已有戰勝統系之方針、對於戰役將士、懸想昔日發現之光榮、爲已失之幸福起見、希氏毫無顧忌、然彼厭惡恢復昔日情形之計劃、希氏已知戰役前國内之租金何若也、自戰役起、租金日增、是時政體之主權人毫無拯救之策、迨後驟形戰役崩潰、立卽屈服於紅黨之下、足以表示政治内政部之弱點焉、實彼等引軍隊至極點時而失民衆之心也、</p>
<p>希氏知失敗之源當根本剷除之、且當超越中級德國世界哲學之缺點、西歷一九一八年發生一項運動、此項運動於戰役前若干年已露萌芽、自一八七一年帝國後、經濟日增之速、因平分地權論説變遷、至宇宙間最以實業爲本之各國、已顯然矣、此項驟然變遷、於中等財産者漠不關心、由是實利主義之傾向生焉、尙未佩帶主持自由思想之假面具、但另有懷疑派·操縱派·利用自由主義、陽奉陰違、故意毁損民主政體而已、中等財産階級者已得口頭之益、而未確知應得者爲何、西歷一九一八年中級人民讚助紅黨、希民知彼等於最後只有反動、絶無力再恢復帝國、另有大多數民衆、自詡代表有財産之民衆、然彼等之間、可謂風馬牛不相及、希氏欲與之共同負責、然希氏知彼之欲望與痛苦、感觸受第二三級之待遇、以世界財産爲種種價格之方策、中級民衆之痛苦與彼等之假作仁慈、萬惡極矣、德國工人因被内部不滿意所驅使、絶不被馬克斯主義所麻醉、彼等深知實利主義之論説粗而易解、而外表尋求資本主義之仇敵已實現於外、國家觀念與國家結合無形消滅、且被奸雄所毁、而中級民衆信仰萬國主義由是而生、世界各國無如德國信仰馬克斯主義之多、且無一他國反對份子已得有廣大之容積希氏自煽動後、自有經騐、後有嫉妒者竭力倡自私之野心、希氏不得不棄其工作、然尙未有人熱心此種藐視國家繁榮者於仇敵面前、絶無膽敢爲社會主義之工作、由此可知四載有半之苦戰付於流水、國内産生無限叛逆、卽人民之崩潰、實由此也、且帝國旗幟消滅於世、亦未必不由此也、德國勞工階級、在百萬殉難將士目中、似爲負責者、而前方戰士、係各有職業者、徒然玉碎而已、希氏自信當有雙式工作、當復興人民有國家思想、然後國家方復得回復工作、無論何項德人、當如希氏之爲國爲民也、黨爭情形、希氏首創國民社會主義、救濟德人生存於世、爲開始挣扎紀念日、彼時有歐戰時作戰者、係一伍長、響應希氏、另有一同志、善趨行政之途、被約倡行希氏所創之主義、雖於黑暗時期、拯德觀念穏立不動、卒得妙策、借以集合新氣象、民氣因之日勝、（未完）</p>

<p>分治蝗卵治跳蝻治飛蝗三步進行</p>
<p>京訊、中央農業實騐所、爲消除各省蝗災起見、曾於六月初召開江浙皖冀魯豫湘七省治蝗會、决議各項治蝗辦法、該所爲研究全國蝗蟲分佈情形、爲割狀况及防治方法計、特請中大農學院敎授鄒鍾琳爲特約治蝗研究員、於上週赴山東·河北·河南·江蘇　四省調查研究、同時並派本所病蟲害系技士任明道、及蝗蟲調查員錢聲浩二人、分赴安徽江蘇兩省調查蝗害狀况、頃悉該所對治蝗防治方法、現已擬有辦法、亟録如下、　供關心農事者之參考、</p>
<p>治蝗卵法　（一耕鋤法、蝗蟲的卵　産在地面下約有一二寸深、牠受了四週土壤的保護、常能安然過多而孵化、我們若把蝗卵週圍的土壤除去、牠就很容易受傷而失去生活力、所以在荒地發現蝗羣遺卵時、我們可用犂深耕土壤、把卵塊翻出地面、這時卵塊或受太陽的照射而乾死、或被冰雪凍結而凍死、或被各種鳥類看見而吃掉、此外尙有一部份的卵塊、直接被犂破壞而致死、如蝗蟲産卵在河岸、堤埂　路旁等處、不能用犂深耕時、可用鋤代犂把土壤鋤起、敲碎土塊、使蝗卵暴露於空中、受着外界的氣候的變化及天敵的侵害而死亡、在夏蝗産卵的地方、尤應趕速耕鋤、稍失時機、就很容易孵化爲秋蝻、食害我們的禾苗、此時因天氣極熱、卵塊耕起後、很容易給太陽晒死的、（二）掘卵法、在蝗蟲産卵的區域内、巡視土表微微凸起或滿佈小孔的地方、用鋤剷或掘卵器掘起卵塊、設法破壞牠的組織、使牠不能孵化、或把牠喂給雞鴨吃、此外尙可用尾插（柄用木製頭用鐵製）擇有蝗卵的地方、用揷穿入土中、掘毁蝗卵、或用長約一尺、直徑約一寸的竹竿、把下面二寸多長的部份、用也斜削成一斜面、下端稍尖、用時把這竹竿尖端揷入小孔旁邊、再把竹午一轉、向上一挑、卵塊便可掘出、　　治跳蝻法　（一）掘溝法、掘溝防治跳蝻、是很有成效的方法、跳蝻當遷移的時候、成羣結隊的向前進行、我們可以在蝻羣跳躍的前方、掘溝攔住、溝的長度、没有一定、可依蝻羣蔓延的面積做標準、溝的闊度、應以蝻的齡期做標準、因爲各齡蝻的跳躍力、都不相同、蝻齡愈大、跳躍力亦愈强、普通所用的溝、溝面的闊要三日餘寸、深約三尺至四尺、這樣溝的兩壁、就成爲内向傾斜形了、溝裏掘起的泥土、應該堆置在跳蝻遷移的前方、使牠不能跳過溝而跌入溝中、溝壁要光滑、使蝻跌入後不能爬出、再在溝内每隔五六尺處挖一深坑、跳蝻躍入溝中、自然會向坑裏跌落、溝掘成後、治蝗的人排列成行、包圍跳蝻、趕入溝中、然後用籃或網把牠撈起、掘坑掩埋、以免腐臭、將來還可以利用做肥料、（二）圍打法、在平原荒地或茅草灘上、發生了跳蝻、可用圍打法撲滅之、圍打時先在蝻區之中央、竪一面旗幟、打蝻的人、各自預備掃帚（用竹梢或柳條紥成）或特製之撲蝗帚一把、齊赴蝗區、把蝻羣圍在中間、成一圓圈、然後用帚將蝻羣向中央旗幟處驅逐、慢慢的把包圍圈子縮小、待蝻羣寗集在一處後、太家即用帚盡力把牠打死、或者在圍打之前、在蝻區中央掘一深坑（坑的深度和口徑、以能容納當地蝻羣爲度）、然後取蘆蓆若干張、每張以竹夾之、以便兩手握持、打蝻的人、各持蘆蓆一張、包圍蝻羣、逐漸向中央圍驅、使蝻落入坑中、或以囤積糧食用的棧摺代蘆蓆、亦甚便利、用時兩人各執棧摺的一端、逐漸向中央圍縮、迫蝻跳入坑裏、坑滿後、即掩土埋之、再另換地點、如法進行、（三）鴨啄法　用鴨啄食蝗蝻、效力很大、按照我們以往的經騐、每一隻大鴨、在一天中、能吃掉蝗蝻二斤、若用一千隻鴨去吃蝻、在一天中就能吃去二千斤、例如去年江蘇武進滆湖一帶、發生大批秋蝻勢甚猖獗、經沿湖船放鴨啄食（每天有萬頭未成長之鴨吸食、大約每天能消滅蝻羣五十担、經過七八天後、沿湖的蝻羣、都被吸食盡凈、鴨啄法的效力固然很大、惟鴨食食過度、往往容易致死、這是應該注意的、例如今年江蘇江寗縣龍潭地方、用鴨啄蝻、因所食過多、以致四萬餘頭之鴨羣、脹死了四五百頭、所以利用鴨啄法、在事前應注意幾點、第一要在附近有水的地方、第二不宜給鴨吃的過飽、第三要每隔半點鐘後　趕鴨下水游泳和吃水、第四給鴨休息、如此則鴨吃蝻後、便容易消化、而不會死了、（四）油殺法、洋油（即普通點燈用的火油）殺蝗蟲的效力很大、如在河旁或湖邊發生了跳蝻、我們先在水面噴澆薄油一層、然後驅蝻入河、使蝻體觸油窒息而死、應用這種方法時、如河水流動、則應先在河流的兩頭、用竹竿或草純擱住　使油不致失散、又用掘溝法時、溝中灌以水、水面略灑洋油、跳蝻跌入溝中即觸油死亡、此法比較單掘溝而溝裏不灌水的功效要大得多、在近水之處、得應用此法（五）網撈法　在河流附近發生跳蝻時、常見有蝻羣渡河、這時可在蝻羣的週圍、用竹竿或草純攔住、趕牠到近河岸的旁邊、因跳蝻在水中、不能跳躍、故我們可用竹篩或鐵紗製成的網在水中打撈、撈出後掘坑埋葬、有時河邊上發生跳蝻、也可用人工驅入河内、然後撈捕、（六）毒何法、跳蝻食料不多的地方、可以撤布毒餌給牠吃、吃牠吃下肚去、就會中毒死亡、毒餌的做法、用麥麩三十份、白砒（可用國貨白信石（砒霜）代替、每斤價約四角）和飴糖各一份、先把糖溶在水裏、再把麥麩和砒混和、倒入糖水、拌攪均匀、再加入清水（約二十五份）使麥麩濕潤至成豆渣狀爲止、倘能在麥麩裏加入些香料（如橘汁·橙汁·檸檬汁·）則更好、這樣便容易使香味發散、誘蝻來吃、撒布時期、應在早晨和傍晚、否則容易晒乾而失去效力、毒餌的用量、視蝻的多寡而定、每畝約三斤、其價值麥麩每斤約值銀三分、白砒每斤約七角五分、飴糖每斤約五分、如用麥麩三十斤、白砒和飴糖各一斤、製成毒餌、共計需銀約一元七角、用以撒布於七畝之而積、則每畝僅需銀二角四分、尙屬經濟、撒布毒餌的方法用手將麥麩揑成　狀、在蝗區每隔相當距離（蝻羣稠密處每二方尺内撒一顆、稀散時每五方尺内撒一顆）、撒佈一顆、但須注意餌内有毒、家畜家禽等、宜禁止入内、（七）袋集法、在稻田裏發生跳蝻、不能應用其他方法防治時、可用捕蝗袋掃捕而撲殺之、又飛蝗於晚間及清晨停息在植物上、不能飛動時、亦可採用此法、</p>
<p>治飛蝗法　（一）捕捉法、飛蝗的飛翔强力很大、不容易防治、惟在天雨的時候、或傍晚至早晨氣溫降低、露水降落的時候、飛蝗翅上沿着雨水或露水、不能飛翔、最容易捕捉、飛蝗停落的地方、大都在蘆葦、高梁和雜草裏、我們可以趁牠停落的時候去捕捉、捕捉時須聚集大羣的人、携帶竹簍蔴袋等物、同時進行、捉到的蝗蟲、隨時揑死、放在簍或袋裏、等到簍或袋裝滿後、即掘坑埋葬、以免腐臭、倘若日問無暇捕捉、可在夜裏點了燈籠、按照上法去捉、這種方法、如大家能努力去做、收效一定很大、去年江蘇武進縣治蝗、用錢收買飛蝗、有弟兄二人、自言用半夜工夫、在蘆葦捕獲飛蝗二百多斤、這就是很好的例子哩、</p>

<h3 id="c117">輸出入主要品 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>再就輸出　入主要商品而言、本月份輸入方面以米榖爲第一位、計五０六二·八八金單位、五金第二、計四·一０二·六九金單位、棉花第三、計三·三六七·四七六金單位、其他如機器達二·九００二二一金單位、紙達一·八一０·三七六金單位、棉貨達一·０二六·八一八金單位、此外爲煤油·小麥·糖·等、均達八十餘萬金單位、至於本年六個月來輸入首位、則允推棉花、蓋以美棉進口關係、其他則爲五金米榖煤油、輸出方面、以茶爲最多、計共五·００八·四六八元、蛋産品次之、計共三·七二五·六三八元、此外如棉紗亦達三·五八三·七二一元、桐油達三·００八·一一八元、皮貨達二·０四七·五八三元、至於綢緞花生、均在一百六七十萬元間、本年六個月輸出總數、以皮貨爲最多、棉紗蛋産品及茶等次之、如與上年上半年輸出總額比較、各貨均趨下落、尤以生絲减落最慘、僅皮貨一項、略有增加而已、</p>
<h3 id="c118">各埠貿易情形 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>至就輸出入埠别而言、當以上海爲銷納之要埠、本月份輸入計四五·五九五·八七七元、占總額百分之五二·四、輸出計二四·四七六·九０九元、占總額百分之四九·八、其重要可知、其他各埠、輸入以九龍天津膠州次之、輸出以廣州天津漢口膠州次之、各埠與上月比較、上海膠州輸出入、均趨减退、天津輸出略低、漢口輸出增加一倍、九龍輸出入均有增加外、餘均平穏、</p>

<p>談考察經過及青海政情</p>
<p>中央社云、青海右翼輔國公雅楞丕勒、號清齋、爲青海第二十九旗盟長之介弟、於前年奉令、分赴全國各地、考察工商業、以作建設該省之參考、已於日前由港抵滬、定日内返省復命、中央社記者、昨往訪雅氏於其寓所、詢以關於此次考察經過及青海政情、據談如次、</p>
<h3 id="c126">考察經過 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>雅氏首談、此次考察經過云、二十九旗人士、鑒於青海建設之重要、故派本人分赴全國各地考察、足跡所經、計河北·山東·山西·陜西·江蘇·浙江·廣東·廣西·四川·等省、對於各地工商業之狀况、曾加以詳細之調查、俾作將來建設青海之參考、而認廣西全省之建設、最有朝氣、並最合作青海之借鏡、任務現已告竣、擬在滬稍事勾留、卽返青復命、同時並希望全國工商界集資赴青海投資、換言之、青海滿地黄金、無人拾取、故希望國人前往甚切、更望各界先行組織考察團體、前往考察、</p>
<h3 id="c127">地廣人少 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>青海於民國成立後、置青海辦事長官於西寗、嗣因庫倫西藏、屢起事端、復增置蒙番宜慰使、至民國四年、兩職均取消、改設寗海鎭守使、管轄青年全部、國民政府成立後、十七年明令劃甘肅西寗道七縣及青海全部爲青海省、全省面積約二百五十餘萬方里、東西相距約二千五百里、南北一千八百餘里、如閩浙皖贛四省之大、人口僅有六百十九萬五千人、不及四川省人口十分之一、其民族最多爲蒙藏二族、漢回二族次之、全省政治經濟敎育等權、則操諸回族之手、氣候與河北山東等省相似、</p>
<h3 id="c128">敎育衰落 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>青海人士、因歷史上關係、心目中只知有當地王公、故王公之權力極大、其文化低下、智識淺薄、故敎育之振興、實爲當今惟一急務、現在全省小學、共有五十餘所、省會所在地之西寗、僅有中學校及職業學校四所、境内鑛産藏蓄之富、四於全國、如鹽·金·銀·鋼·煤·煤油·翠玉·鉛·鐵·燐等、均尙未加以開發·工商業亦極幼稚、工業僅賴手工編織、商業以藥材爲出口大宗、輸入以布·糖·酒、等最多、</p>
<h3 id="c129">交通不便 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>青海因交通不便、致與内地阻隔、故開發青海、應先從交通建設入手、目下該省交通狀况、陸路以西寗爲中心、（一）由西寗出發向東行、經過甘肅之皐蘭、越六盤山、而通西安、是爲通内地大道、（二）由西寗出發、向西南行、越南山叢嶺、經鄂陵札陵兩海之間、又越巴顔喀喇山脈、西經玉樹、過當拉嶺、通西藏拉薩、是爲本省境内大道、又爲通西藏大道、（三）由西寗出發、繞青海沿岸、經都蘭寺、　過柴達木、西北行而通新疆大道、（四）由本省向西南渡黑水、可通西藏、向東南可通川邊之松潘、沿東北入甘肅境、可進長城各口而通寗夏、正南沿長江河流、或越崑崙南支、均可入西康、汽車路有二綫、（一）蘭湟汽車路、自甘肅蘭州至青海湟源、長四百五十里、此路已成、（二）西寗循環汽車路、自西寗起經武威、寗夏·西凉·天水·仍止於西寗、長二千七百五十里、此路尙在修築、水路交通、因水道深淺不等、甚感不便、若加疏濬、則水運便利、當不亞内地江南各省、不過冬季結冰時、難通舟楫而已、本省現在水運情形極簡單、非若内地之用船隻、自西寗至湟蘭、有皮筏沿湟通行、郵政在西寗設有總局、各縣設有分局、西北通本省都蘭、西南通西藏拉薩、對内地往來郵件極多、電報僅有一綫、總局設西寗、經皐蘭通内地各省云、</p>

<h3 id="c130">工部局人力車務委會昨日招待新聞界 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>解釋車委會之目的</p>
<p>車商車夫仍多懷疑</p>
<p>中央社云、公共租界工部局人力車務委拒絶不領、屈時勢必發生人力車無地執照員會、昨日招待各報社記者、對車商　反對委員會之設施、及逾期未領車之執照等、由該會委員長麥西·朱　澄·王志仁·詳爲報告、兹將麥西之報告探誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c131">改革目的 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>該會委員長麥西氏、首申明兩點、（一）該會之目的、謂委員會之組織、並非與車商爲難、而在改善車夫生活、改革車輛式樣、以冀人力車業務之發展、委員會爲達到此目的、或有與車主利害衝突之點、固在意料之中、但委員會則始終以車務之發展爲其職志、（二）日前報載虞洽卿出任調停爲委員會拒絶之訊、絶非事實、虞氏曾介紹車商數人、到會接洽、渠本人絶未發表意見、更無調停之事、况虞氏亦華董之一、在工部局組織之下、共同努力、渠熱心社會事業、素爲各界及同仁所推崇、渠對此事、有所主張、委員會當樂於接受、自無拒絶之事、</p>
<h3 id="c132">拉洽經過 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>（三）麥西氏繼報告與車商接洽之經過云、車主領取證書、係由工部局通過頒佈、自六月一日起至七月二十一日截止、當時車商反對同業公會、並阻止車主來會領證、迨限期旣届、車商領袖數人到會、正式請求委員會展期截止、並担保車主、當如期請領執照、會方接受其請求、卽展期至三十日爲止、詎展期一星期後、未見有車主來會領照、其不顧信用、出爾反爾、殊非誠意與會恊謀、至頒發車主證書之意義、蓋以由人代捐、發見種種流弊、（四）車商方面、更宜傳委員會之目的、在消滅人力車業、以助電車及公共汽車等營業之發展、此説與事實恰成相反、委員會之工作、係根據工部局之規定、其一切設施、在其他營業、頗表反對之意、蓋其於取消人力車、頗有妨碍、一般意見、以爲經如此改革、人力車得繼續存在、（五）車商有以車夫登記、並以四萬人爲限之規定、謂爲不顧苦力之生活、而加以宣傳者、在委員會所有登記之規定、蓋欲予車夫以人格上之地位、而規定四萬人、亦以維持車夫較優之生活、現租界内有車一萬輛、以四萬人分配之、當不致影響其收入、</p>
<h3 id="c133">救濟會事 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>（六）關於人力車夫互助會事、係車夫自動之發起、在二三月前、車夫到工部局請求組織救濟會者甚多、局方因由車夫自行組織、不能專一事權、還恐不能得宏大之效果、故經規定、徵納捐欵、每車每月一元五角、並推舉委員、組織保管委員會、專管此欵、並支配用途、作人力車夫生活敎育衛生等之設施、絶不移作他用、車商方面、希圖破壞、惡意宣傳、自不足信、而其本身對救濟車夫、亦宣傳甚力、但對减低車租、何不卽行、其徒事宣傳可知、（七）車商有謂、依照委員會規定、减租後、將不能營業、但會方已接得二千餘新車主之請求、發給車照約二萬輛、並謂願接受一切規定、可知减租後、車主亦可營業、而現在車商此種反對、顯不足憑云、</p>
<h3 id="c134">發證展期 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>現工部局發給車主證書、已於昨日截止、期内已到局領取者、依車輛計算、約爲百分之四十五、（計四千五百輛）八月份之新車照、將按證書發給、至發照日期、原定至八月六日截止、現因税務處手續未備、展自八日起至十三日止、逾期不捐照者、將禁止營業、又車商申言、如此事不卽解决、將實行罷租、據麥西氏語記者、希望不發生此種糾紛、否則如擾亂公共治安、則必嚴予處置、又减租事亦定於下月一日起實行云、</p>
<h3 id="c135">車商態度 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>新聲社云、人力車業同業公會特區辦事處、全體會員車同、准今晨依照歷來辦法、向公平路人力車騐車處持現行車主證書、領取騐車證、俾再向捐務處納捐領取執照、如捐務處定要車商憑事租證書及遵照新章領取執照、則一致拒絶不領、届時勢必發生人力車無執照而不能營業、如最短期内是項問題仍未得解决、則下月十四日起、公共租界人力車、勢必因無營業執照而全部停頓、又查工部局人力車委員會所發車主證書、因未經代捐人證明、及登報公告、故已發之證書、雖僅二百餘份、但各車主所領新證書、送交人力車同業公會審核者、已有一百八十一張、業經該會以公會車主登記册及市公用局登記册核對、已發現車主姓名錯誤者、竟有三十五人之多、計車輛一百七十七輛、同業公會因鑒於人力車委員會所發車主證手續不公開、以致舛誤甚多、一再要求愼重辦理、均置不理、認其目的、似非眞在保障車主産權云、</p>
<h3 id="c136">車夫公函 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>人力車夫代表昨致工部局函云、敬呈者、竊近數月來、鈞局致力於人力車問題之研究、及車夫之救濟事宜、不惜以重大之犧牲、完成是項艱巨之工作、足徵關懷貧民痛苦、佩甚佩甚、而所定計劃、均以車夫利益爲中心、則車夫等何幸蒙此厚惠、實將没齒不忘、惟檢視鈞局新定辦法中、尙有二點滋人疑慮、不敢苟且、兹分述疑點於次、（一）查鈞局現組織互助會、辦理車主救濟事業、意至良而法至美、惟又規定該會費用、由車夫擔任、責令車商每輛每日向車夫徵收小洋一角、總計每月小洋三十角、復又採用包捐性質、着車商每月繳納大洋一元五角、其他之數、似歸爲車商酬勞、查救濟車夫之費用、取自車夫本身、已屬不當、而况助長車商、取此非法利益、用意究屬何在、似此辦法、在車夫則利害相衡、不能平允在鈞局反有助長車商剥刻車夫之嫌、此疑問者一也、（二）查鈞局現訂車租、每日小洋十角、未知此項租金數目、係包括華法英三照會範圍而言、抑係單獨英照之車租、若係包括三照會全體而言、則鈞局是否已徵得華法當局之同意、或華法當局是否曾賦予鈞局有此種特殊權力、否則僅指英照而言、倘華法兩當局亦仿此而行、則車租豈非將增至三十角耶、較之原有十三四角之車租、豈非轉爲加租耶、此疑問者二也、總上二點、世德等因不敢以小人之心、有所猜度、惟願鍔局早有明白解釋、以釋羣疑、不勝感禱待命之至、此上公共租界工部局、上海市十萬人力車夫代表張世德·王富貴·陳禄才·徐少三·高萬福·李三、</p>

<p>两人早有苟且行爲</p>
<p>突然爭吵發生慘案</p>
<p>昨晨八時許、滬西小沙渡路海防路口、發生一血案、死者爲姑丈與舅嫂、情節離奇、兹將各情紀述於下、</p>

<p>李劍雲浦東南匯縣人、年三十五歲、家住滬西小沙渡路海防路口第八一零號、並開設春泰恊記營造廠、李妻陸氏、亦南匯籍、初陸氏因乃母寵愛異常、未令出閣、而招劍雲入贅伊家、陸氏有一弟、娶妻陳氏、名瞻蓮、同爲南匯人、夫婦間情感尙佳、李劍雲因早夕相見、且爲一家人、故彼此甚爲親睦、</p>

<p>詎在前年間、陳氏之夫忽爾病卒、當時李親爲内弟料理喪事、倍顯殷勤、誰知李見舅嫂陳氏風姿綽約、早存不良之念、况又文君新寡、李乃時向陳氏誘以甘言蜜語、不久陳氏果被誘惑、墮其彀中、兩情繾綣、備極恩愛、詎時機不密、被陳妻陸氏發覺、與夫大起交涉、並責以大義、但李置若罔聞、反與陳氏實行同居、</p>

<h3 id="c173">重提前議 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>不料日前陳氏忽接乃兄墨權來函、内中專係叮囑陳氏、速與李劍雲結婚、並稱否則將來難免自悔等語、因此陳氏又同劍雲重提前議、而李仍含糊作答、陳氏心中不滿、大起衝突、昨晨八時許、李陳兩人同時起身、卽在房内盥洗、陳氏見李神色鎭靜、乃又向其詰問結婚辦法、詎兩人談未數語、又起爭吵、各不相讓、</p>
<h3 id="c174">男女同死 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>李劍雲見陳氏愈爭愈烈、一時氣憤不過、竟向身畔拔出其自備之馬牌六寸手槍、向陳氏連發兩槍、一中太陽穴、一中胸部、當塲倒地、血流如注、斃於寢室内、　時李之女傭、在房中見女主被主人槍殺、駭極而號、亟亟反身奔出呼救、同時李見已肇大禍、乃亦舉槍向自已太陽穴開放一槍、倒於陳氏屍旁、及女傭鳴捕到來、則均已氣絶身死、乃急報告戈登路捕房、派探前往查勘一過、一面派車將男女兩斃、分送寳隆廣仁兩醫院、檢視一過、轉送騐屍所待騐、一面派員通知屍屬、</p>

<p>近來接到讀者紛紛的來信聲明久不通信的原因；並要求不即取銷登記，仍想做一個我們的讀書朋友，在這一點，我們是非常欣慰的。在有幾封來信中，還談到我們對於讀者的態度的問題，關於這一點，我們似乎不得不再説幾句：</p>
<p>我們對於讀者的關係一向是基於共同的興趣與無强制的友情上。我們之間不是學校學學生之間的關係。我們之間的紐帶，在形式方面説是比學校與學生之間要鬆懶，但是精神上却更堅守。這可用七月以來的事實去説明。</p>
<p>旣然如此，爲什麽我們對於久不爱信的讀者還要一再催促，還要用取消登記去督促呢？爲什麽還要發成績調查表去考察讀者的成績呢？這不是一種矛盾嗎？</p>
<p>不！這不是矛盾。我們雖是朋友，但不是普通的朋友。我們現在都是出於心願的，在正正經經的談學問。我們不是文人，談學問不是爲消閑，我們都是一面爲了生活挣扎一面還想獲得一點知識，以應付自已的生活。我們的友情旣然是這樣嚴肅的，那就不僅應作知識的交通，還應有生活的督促。所以我們對於讀者採用一切形式的督促都是基於這一原則。這是一。</p>
<p>第二，就我們的工作方面説，雖然是誠心的爲人服務，不必偏重形式，但凡做一項事情，總不能不用科學的學理。我們不能無計劃的，亂喊讀書，隨便作答。我們爲了工作，必要作出各類統計、方纔能澈底了解自已做了一些什麽，讀者是否受到實益。過去的不够與錯誤何在，今後各該怎樣？如果讀者成分有了變動，自然我們應與之相適應，我們對於讀者生活實有十分明瞭的必要。</p>
<p>第三，現在發現「讀書問答」的人一天天多了。外埠有源源不絶的人來參加讀書指導部，他們態度萬分誠懇，我們無理由可以隨便拒絶，同時我們人手有限，又不能把工作無限澎漲。所以我們唯一辦法是取消興趣已减退的朋友的登記，讓興趣好的朋友補入。這是這次關於取消登記實際的原因。</p>
<p>總之：我們極希望我們與讀者間不需要一點强制，但不能不有一些必要的「形式」。因爲讀書也不能是完全「無政府主義的」。</p>
<h3 id="c189">談「新詩歌」創作專號 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>盧火</p>
<p>介紹一本大家能讀懂的詩歌</p>
<p>中國的新詩歌運動，歷史也有十多年了。但是，在這十多年中所産生的詩歌，都是我們看不懂聽不慣的東西，那此詩歌是給一般知識份子去欣賞的。不是寫給我們看的。</p>
<p>前個月本報「讀書問答」介紹了一本「新詩歌」歌謡專號給我們。看了之後，覺得非常的愛好牠，因爲裏面没有難懂和歐化的句子，没有玩甚麽使人頭昏的技巧，裏面叙述的都是和我們比較接近的生活，尤其這些歌謡是很合我們的口胃的。因此，我時常都盼望着牠的創作專號早日出來和我們相見現在，繼着歌謡專號，這本創作專號又和我們見面了。這本創作專號裏面一共有三十六篇創作讀了之後，把一些感想寫在後面：</p>
<p>這些作品中，有一篇「阻運」（詩劇）和「六士兵」（大衆合唱詩）是值得特别注意的。因爲這是很新鮮的形式，「阻運」寫得很好。描寫統治者對於農民的剥削。非常動人，同時，作者「抗喲……嗨呀……」的舟子的唱聲，運用得自然有力，變成一種有節奏的自然音樂。「大衆合唱詩」，雖是很需要的，但是我覺得「六士兵」是没成功。我曾經呌好幾人來合唱過，但是不能合唱的地方很多，唱起來也不緊張，聽不懂，有許多人物説的話就非要和做戲一般的先介紹同來不行。我希望他們以後多刊點這樣的詩，並且要比這更進步能够合唱的。</p>
<p>那三十四篇詩作，除了「偉大的愛」之外，都是很可多讀的作品，不過，全部看來，在表現方法上是不統一的，如「夜的流浪者」，「我在守望着」等是受了新月派的影響，「砸石子的姑娘」，「蛙」，「秋收」，等有點像「現代」詩的形式。其餘「行不得呀哥哥」，「煤這傢伙」，「守堤者，「寄父親」，「小三子」，「祖父的牛」…………等的形式是比較自由的，詞句也比較自然。</p>
<p>長詩中，我最愛：「煤這像伙」，「我們的堡，「寄父親」，「祖父的牛」和「小三子」。他們描寫各種生活，從生活中看出了他們的「路」。同有空喊，没有狂呌。用沉重細膩的筆調，寫出了各種生活的前苦，一種纒綿的情感捆住了讀者的心。</p>
<p>短詩中，我最愛「村莊的午後」和「砸石子的姑娘。前者在短短的十幾句中，把農村的輪廓，過去的繁榮，目前的崩潰都很活潑地表現出來了。後者了把砸石姑娘的生活和社會的矛盾表現得很好。</p>
<p>「蛙」那一篇是很和「現代」詩相近，寫得太過朦朧了，大衆是看不出主題來的。「海風」的寫法似乎是回憶的，　但我覺得不一貫，不太過合。「偉大的愛」是郭沫若時代的浪漫手法，同時和全本的詩歌是調和不來的。</p>
<p>不過，無論如何，我們要承認，「新詩歌」是中國詩壇僅有的奇葩，牠是敢擺脱一切舊皮囊創作歌唱給大衆聽的詩歌，我敢向不是知識階級的朋友們介紹這一本書。</p>
<p>這一本是我們看得懂的自已的詩歌！</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>除却上面我已經講過的這幾輛專用的車子而外，其餘的車子，便是那些太監們所居住的。但因人多車少的緣故，直擠得密密層層地連一些空隙也没有，簡直像快要堆起來的一樣，我雖不曾常去參觀，不知道他們究竟是怎樣居住着的，不過推想他們的情形，必然和那些扁聽子裏所裝的沙丁魚没多大差别。</p>
<p>在中國，却没有「沙丁魚」這個名稱，但我旣想到了這一個有趣味的比例，當然不肯忍耐着不發表，於是我終於向一個太監説道：</p>
<p>「你們這些人擠在那幾輛車子裏，眞像小魚一樣！」接着，我並將外國人怎樣把沙丁魚裝進那些扁聽子裏去的情形，詳細講給他聽，他聽了，自已也忍不住笑起來了；於是我這一釋話，便由他立卽代爲傳佈出去，一人傳十，十人傳百，不消多少工夫，所有的太監全知道了！當然也瞞不過李蓮英！但是李蓮英本不和他們住在一起，他也有一輛專用的車子，我這個話當然也不是挖苦他，他聽了當然也不能生氣！不過其餘的太監聽人家把他們呌做小魚，心上也未必會高興吧？</p>
<p>在北京，人們對於太監有一個極普遍通用的别名，喚做「雄雞兒」，因爲那些太監的喉音，總是很尖很高的，眞是雞啼的聲音一般無二，所以這個别名，大家都一致認爲十分確當。我想太監們自已也還願意承受，因爲「雄雞」總比「小漁」好一些。</p>
<p>讀者試想：一千名太監，每個人都穿着全套的制服，而他們所佔的幾輛車子，却實在只能容得下四百個人：那樣舒服的生活，你們能忍受得慣嗎？（九四）</p>
<h3 id="c192">求婚之道 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>求婚是件藝術的事情，不能蠢幹，要做得聰明，要隨機應變。</p>
<p>譬如你和伊一同去游泳，你就可以在池中造成你的機會，把伊捉住，便來無蹤去無影似地對伊説：「我總想找一個背景向你求婚，你説這背景好不好？一給伊一個猝不及防。要是伊有允意，而且是個頑皮的姑娘，伊會問道：「什麽背景？」向了便笑着游開去。那時，你可追上去，再把伊促住，問題就這樣解决了。</p>
<p>像這樣的機會不是很多嗎？</p>
<p>只是你要講得婉轉而清楚，要讓伊聽請你的字眼，聽懂你的意思。要是那時候伊再裝糊塗，你不必重複申説，説了還是得不到伊的許可的，很明顯。我記得有一位先生爲了話講得含糊，失去了一個機會。他對一位小姐説：「我愛你。」小姐説：「謝謝你」先生以爲小姐謝絶：小姐在等着先生進一步的請求，預備答應，可是没有等到，於是這事情就這樣過去了。後來小姐有了另一位戀人，這位先生便去看那戀人，要請他讓步。乞憐在無論什麽事中都要不得，何况在男女之間的愛的塲合？這位先生的失敗自然是意中事。</p>
<p>還有，一般人總以爲求婚是男的向女的提出的，這，有許多伶俐的小姐在偷笑。伊爲你設計了一個局面，你不知道，你把它輕易地辜負？有的知道了却並不應用，以爲再維持一下原狀，且待更成熟的時期。這，在前者是蠢，不用説，在後者也是蠢，因爲那時以後伊給你的是逐漸冷淡，或者甚至於突然的嫌棄，朋友？决不是你所想像得到的更成熟啊？</p>

<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>千里盲子是吾邑（長興）著名的一個惡訟，在一千里以内的訟事，一經它承辦以後，没有不勝訴的。有兩樁事，可以證明它的本領不錯！</p>
<p>一天已在歲暮的時候，它由湖州回長興去，在船内，舟子儘管向它訴苦，它問舟子可是要錢用？如果是要錢用的話，船過虹星橋的時候，你儘管向有錢人家的水閣樓上猛力撞去！舟子諾諾連聲，到了虹星橋，果眞把某姓家的水閣樓柱撞坍了。這家人向舟子理論，千里盲子走到船頭上，把舟子打了一個耳刮子，駡道：「你眞混賬，把船摇到人家家内去了嗎？我千里盲子不見，難道你也不見嗎？今天請你們把他送到縣裏去」。這人家因震於千里盲子的威名，又自知私佔官河有罪，反出了二百塊錢，給與舟子，以作修船之費。</p>
<p>某縣長上任時，聞千里盲子惡名，買盜誣贓，捉他到案。千里盲子自已躱入叉袋内，命家人扛入縣堂，問盜曰：「我千里盲子，今生同你無怨，前生與你無仇，你爲什麽説我坐地分贓？但你可知道我面上有麻無麻？有髭無髭？盜瞠目不能答，良心發現，説是縣長買盜誣良」縣長愕然。不上幾天，縣長就被千里盲子所控，打入牢獄。</p>

<p>某巨公素以工詩善畫稱，自奉甚儉，冬不裘，夏不綢，食無重味，深居簡出，於世事幾不問不聞。惟嗜茶成癖，一日三茗，竟無間日，有小環曰清香者，於雜作之外，專司其事，從不假手他人，據其語人，平生未嘗飲他人茶，可知其飲茶之精究也。公之所嗜，爲龍井與鳳尾，至如茶葉之貯藏，烹煮之得宜，茶壺之古雅，確有獨到處，所藏之茶壺，以紫砂居多，形形色色，大小不一，常用者三把，均曼生壺也，以此晨夕更替不稍紊亂特名之曰晨壺，中壺，惟臨睡所飲之壺，不曰夕壺，晚壺，而曰夢壺云。一日有僧自普陀來，餽以眞鳳尾茶二筒，時適庭中荷花盛開，公卽以鳳尾一掇，置之花中，輕縳之，翌晨取出，清香雋永，别饒風味，是日也，小環臥病，故命老媼如法泡之，旋以壺進，公啟壺蓋，卽有所悟，曰：老婢無知，竟私啜我之荷香鳳尾茶耶，立喚之前，痛戒至再，而媼誓不認，公曰：余一生飲茶，知之稔矣，夫茶之初泡也，其葉載沉載浮，狀態凌亂，以此測之，百不爽一，而此茶獨否，試觀壺中之葉，其瓣尖齊向壺嘴，稍傾猶可，今且被汝私啜盡凈矣，汝尙何言耶？媼赧而退。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>他向來看報，是不注重國家大事。到了今日，就突然會感到這緊要新聞是自已最關切的文字。這張小報上，不過很簡單的説，敵於前天晚上，用飛機大砲唐克車克三種利器，進攻平安堡。守堡子的國軍，拚命抵抗，後來彈盡援絶，堡子就失陷了。至於軍隊下落如何，那就不知道。可是在城裏死守的，是不是趙自强這些人呢？更是不知道。於是除了所看的這分小報小算，繼續又拿起第二分報紙來看。看到第三份，便是大報，那大報上索興將平安堡三個字登的特别的大，内容大意是説，敵人猛力進攻，國軍又猛力死守，營長寳芳與城同殉，此戰雖全軍覆没，給東北軍爭回不少榮譽，東北軍應有以自勉。桂枝對這些文言，不十分懂，但是猜想着决不是什麽好消息。他現在急於要知道這事情的究竟，這就不能再瞞着老人家了。於是拿了一大捧報紙，走到趙翁房門口，先呌了一聲爹。趙翁許久才抖顫着聲音答道：你進來。桂枝走了進去時，只見趙翁一手伏在桌子上，壓住一張報紙一手揑了乾毛手巾，只管向眼睛上去揉擦。雖是那樣揉擦着，那眼涙水依然不斷的向下滾着，這個樣子，分明這位老人家也得着這不好的消息了。便呆了一呆，站着向趙翁望了道：爹你也瞧見報了嗎？趙翁摇子兩摇頭，又點了兩點頭道：這……這没有什麽，當軍人的，那是應當的。他説着話時，嗓子眼裏，不由得哽咽着，無法子向下説了去。桂枝不必問什麽消息，只看到公公這一番情形，早是眼涙水像串線一般，掛在兩邊臉上。身不自主的靠了房門站定，不住的息息率率哭了起來。（四四五）</p>

<p>我不知道影片能給我一些什麽好處，除了錢。錢對于我這種人是有用的，因爲我已是七十八歲的人了。」世界的大文豪，俏皮的老頭子，伯納，蕭這幾句話，眞够幽默得很。</p>
<p>本來在這個世界，除了錢，還有什麽值得人去玩味的吧？何獨是影片，何獨是對七十八歲的老頭子？</p>
<p>伯納，蕭幸而没有生在中國，所以他還能有定額的進欵，給他支配，處理，和養老。然而在中國呢？</p>
<p>中國的文學家就從來是不值錢的。中國摇筆管的文人，是連最低限度的物質生活費用，也難有着落啦！</p>

<h3 id="c198">洗面的要訣 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>水爲皮膚衛生上，不可缺的要素，然而用如何的水洗面爲最宜，與何種人應用何種的水，各各不同。水有硬水軟水的區别，凡含有石灰鹽，馬克乃西亞Magnusium鹽等，謂之硬水。如用這水洗滌皮膚不健全的人，往往受了刺激，皮膚愈覺粗糙，（井户的水，亦有硬水，）就是擦了肥皂，亦没有效用，硬水經過煮沸，或加些硼酸，硼砂，或加些克里西林Glycerin就變爲軟水。</p>
<p>洗面的次數，不能一定，往往因職業上的關係，每天洗十數次的也有的，普通每次飯後洗三次或臨臥時洗一次，美容上的洗面水，用冷水爲宜，古來有句話：用冷水洗面，雖到老境，尙能保持童顔的，但是冷水與溫水，都有除去脂肪的力，脂肪多的肌膚。或生面庖的人，那以溫水洗滌爲宜，又如常出汗的與脂肪多的部分，患糖尿病，腎臟病，泌尿器病人的陰部，有腋臭人的腋窩，生痔瘡人的肛門，應當每日多洗，如有分泌物，可用亞鉛華與滑石末各一半混合，等到洗凈後，撲在各部，貧血與皮膚柔軟的人，不宜冷水洗面，有濕疹與膿痂疹等皮膚病時，不宜多洗，因爲患濕疹的人，大抵皮膚裏弱，如患急性炎症，皮膚要起赤腫，糜爛，就是結了加皮，亦非常　癢，這時應忌硬水，他如膿痴疹的葡萄狀球菌（或稱連鎖狀球菌）因徽菌而起的皮膚病，洗面時稍不注意，就傳染到面的全部，皮膚不健全的人，當洗面後，應用乾布輕輕摩擦，若使用肥皂，是否含有遊離阿爾加里（Alkali）可用舌尖砥肥皂，如舌尖感到很刺激而淋痺的，斷定其爲不良品，可是肥皂的品質雖好，是否適宜吾人的皮膚，應當注意，假使很刺激皮膚的，就不可再用了。在肥皂没有發明以前，都用糠爲洗臉料，現今醫學界亦認爲有效，譬如患面皰與其他紅腫等皮膚用糠一撮，浸在熱水中洗面（用布袋縫好）是很適宜的，洗後應把糠屑洗凈，不可留在皮膚，免得發生皮下作用。倘若出外旅行，滑相當的軟水，切不可　洗，如因患病，不能用水洗面時，那末，用清凉漿Cold　Cream或酒精（酒精與水各半混和）用藥水棉花輕輕揩拭，除去面上污垢，（切不可入眼）洗後用毛巾把酒精氣味拭凈。余平日都用硼酸洗面，旣可免皮膚病發生，且硼酸水洗眼洗口冲鼻，尤有利益，况且硼酸價格極賤，每磅不到二角可供二十天之用，尤其於清晨或臨臥時有硼酸洗口，可免喉症與傳染病發生，價廉物美，諸君不防試用一下啊。</p>

<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>在承繼文學遺産的聲浪中，脸的人在主張是「學習技巧」。説從中國的過去的文學中，學不到什麽，而是須從外國的作品中去學習。我們的眼睛是要向外看。</p>
<p>這種説法，大致是不錯的。不過，實在説，並不是向裏看或向外看的問題。我們是應從文學的史的發展中，去着眼。誠然，中國文學，是落後的。但是把問題限制於某一歷史階段中，是可以這樣主張的。</p>
<p>中國文學之比外國落後，只能就近代市民文學而言。而且，不是因爲民族或國家的不同，主要是因爲中國没有近代的資本主義。</p>
<p>如果是要從近代的市民文學求營業，那麽，從中國過去的文學作品中找不到什麽。這是事實。而近代的市民社會的文學所給與我們的好處，是比較多，也是無容非議的。這不是中國與外國的問題，而是，世界史的問題。</p>
<p>加果説要從現代作家中，去學習創作方法，自然是應當學習巴比塞，紀德，高爾基，瓦塞曼等等的歐美作家，而不應當一味模仿張天翼或其他的作家。學習張天翼，誰都知道，是不會有出路的。這是一個很明鮮的文學史上的問題。因爲，我們的現在的社會，是落後的。</p>
<p>然而，所謂文學遺産云者，并不是專指近代的市民社會的文學而言。荷馬的二大史詩，是遺産，原始的歌謡，也是遺産。如果説保阿樓（Boileau）的詩，是遺産。當然，杜甫的詩，也是遺産。「水滸傳」的技巧，也不見得不如「喜劇故事」（Roman　Comique）或吉勒·卜拉（Gil　Blas）。然而，在近代市民社會以前，在産業革命以前的西歐文學作品中，是有好些可以提供給我們以文學創作方法的。而，在我個人的經騐中，杜甫的確給了我很多的好處，日本詩人北川冬彦也説過，從杜甫得到了好些的指示。</p>
<p>「學習技巧」，並不是模仿技巧。對於過去的文學作品作精確的研究，得到正當的認識，而由之獲得新的技術，新的創作方法，是承繼文學遺産的問題。主要點是在於把舊的技巧發展一下。如果作「考貝」式的學習，也許是有害的。那樣一來，也許會把文學的遺産縮小到最小範圍，以至於最後會有人否定了文學的遺産。這是含有着很大的危險性的。</p>
<p>對於世界人生的正當的認識，是最要繁的。有正確的歷史的了解，什麽文學遺産都可以承繼，從什麽樣的作品中，都多少可以發明新的技術。波多萊爾，以及世紀末的象徵主義的諸詩人，都給我們以很好的養料的。王維，杜牧等的詩，自然也是同樣。主要的點，是在於我們的認識與展開的問題。</p>
<p>是創作方法之確立，或技術之獲得，而不是考貝式的學習技巧。是歷史的問題，而不是中與外的問題。從舊的作品三究中，獲得新的技術，是要點。自然，主張從杜甫求生活，并不是要作舊詩。正如從左拉求生活，用不着拿法國文寫作同樣。</p>
<p>有人從中譯高爾基的作品中學習，但因爲譯本關係，學會了些新辭藻，而没得到高爾基的眞精神。這不是學習技術，而只是奴性的模仿。</p>
<p>我們所要注意的，是在於怎樣地去承繼文學遺産。這是歷史的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c259">叫喚的藝術 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 林熙寄自北平</p>
<p>偶從新街口走過。看見西瓜攤上擺着金字塔似的一片片的西瓜，瓜販拿着蒲扇一面驅着蠅子，一面拉長了嗓子呌喚：「大塊兒的沙　兒的哩，鬧塊兒啦。」那聲音就像磁石，不管你食不食，總得順着牠往瓜攤上看他兩眼。這於是使我想起呌喚的藝術。</p>
<p>這「鬧」字來得非常有　勁；説到「鬧」，大概總會令人想起：走個十里八里後，再剖瓜解暑的情形。西瓜是那麽富於水分，尤其是沙　兒的，咬起來淋淋欲漓；一不小心，那又綿又脆的沙　兒，説不定會斷下來，掉下去。所以食來總得相當地快，咬一口是一口，猶豫不得：食後抹抹手，擦擦嘴，再痛快地喘牠　聲：「唉」！這情景全讓一個鬧字描透了。</p>
<p>我説要把鬧字換個「食」，那可太没勁了。用邏輯説來，那便未免過於「通稱」。這就像説「船」之使人感到意境糢糊，不如説「漁船」或「輪船」來得「特稱」一些。説「輪船」會使人想到浪和速：説「漁船」會使人想到風和帆，而只説「船」那似乎便有看上下的必要了。曾思王之渙的「白日依山盡，黄河入海流，　欲窮千里目，更上一層樓，」之所以妙，全妙在一個樓字。頭三句無異於告訴你千里景還在後面，這半吞半吐的説法，眞使你心裏不大痛快；等他一説出「樓」來，這才使你喘一口氣。這是因爲「樓」是平音，正在你「上」的當兒，你的願望還在「欲」中，等你上到了，這才平，才舒痛，才能窮千里目：看入海的黄河，看遠山，看白日，看烟，看霧，前前後後，　地球簡直就是一個大圓圈，這够多平的。有一樓字，前後文才不白費；要把「樓」改成「塔」呢？那便糟了　！這一來不但黄河不「流」，簡直就是當你呼吸之際，等你剛一呼便一拳把你心打碎，呌你始終跟死心塔一樣喘不過那一口氣來。鬧字之所以來得有勁，往這方面去找理由，大概便對了。</p>
<p>這是由「鬧」西瓜想到的。説到更廣處，依我走過的城市來説，呌喚的藝術，北平的小販，必然是錦標隊了。呌喚的目的，簡單説來便就是宣傳，不過這種宣傳帶着一個即刻要達到的目的；延遲了便會餓肚子。因之響亮便是第一個要件；這一層，北平的小販，無疑地佔着頭把交椅。看他們那麽一歪頭，半撫着耳根，那聲音簡直就可以跳過房簷，一直竄到人家的院心去。我住的這條胡同，每日黄昏必有兩個響亮的嗓子在那裏震，一個是「炸豆腐開鍋」，另一個是「餛飩開鍋」。清晨也有兩個，一個是豆腐漿，一個是杏仁茶。我就奇怪，凡是碰着應當開鍋的，他們總把「開鍋」放在後頭；而且那兩個字又總被拉得那麽長那麽震，聽來就眞像有那麽一個鍋在你面前苦苦那麽開了似的。這妙處，我想大概便在這個鍋字，鍋字念來，初是那麽撅長了嘴唇，然後帶點餘音縮回去；因之使我想到蓋着蓋的鍋：開起來是那麽苦苦魯魯的，等你一掀蓋，那就像海退了潮，聲音越響越遠；這就正像把嘴唇往回那麽一縮一樣。所以開鍋二字，一面是説水在開，一面是形容了鍋蓋被掀開時的情景；這一來，够有多大的誘惑性呀！呌喚的藝術，有如是者。</p>
<p>賣瓜的不説瓜苦。宣傳總離不了過甚其詞，小販們也曉得這些；像一大個兒的棗兒啦，一大子兒一大碗哩，這種呌喚，小孩們聽了簡直會在媽媽身邊竄起來的。實際上一個大子兒也就是七八個，跟一大碗還差得老遠。不過細想起來，這三個「大」字，也想眞喊得够妙。還有誇張得神形畢肖的，便是將蘿蔔賽梨，將杮子比窩瓜。當秋風挾沙土以俱來時，北平市上，隨處可見又紅又光的大杮子，大固是够大的，但比諸窩瓜，也無怪老太太們會説：「窩瓜够多大的——胡扯」！然而杮子販們却總衆口一辭地呌喚：「窩瓜大的杮子，咬澀了白咬哩」這寥寥數字，眞把一個杮子形容得够瞧，大還不説，大而不澀，可就不易了。冬之夜，和「硬麵誖誖」同爲詩人們所讚嘆的要算是「蘿蔔賽梨　；辣了換」的那個凄　的調兒了。</p>

<p>是的，車水的工作，目前是頂重要的一宗，現在的田地裏，不需要耙鋤，只需要「水」！</p>
<p>「啊，」兒子一面回答，一面另外提議着「明天白天也别下田了，來車水罷。」</p>
<p>説完，他就加快了脚步。爹爹没有回他話，他在忖思着兒子的意見。</p>
<p>到家了。</p>
<p>三口人的家，吃起飯本來很簡單的，這些日以來，尤其簡單－不，該説是緊縮罷，縮得每餐除了糠粰加雜的米飯外，只有一碗鹹菜湯。這，王阿興的心裏還不以爲足，他倒想一家人不吃一粒米纔好。他料到久旱之後，一定是個歉收的年成，將來米價一定暴漲的，爲顧慮到日後，眼前就應該節省。然而，無論怎樣節省，减縮，人活着，總是不能不吃的，他在飯桌上眼看兒子狼吞虎嚥的情形，心裏就覺得陣陣發痛。</p>
<p>兒子又何嘗捨得多吃，實在是一天的勞力消耗後需要酬報呀。</p>
<p>「阿大，我看你倒比從前能吃了。」</p>
<p>王阿興話到唇邊停了好幾次，到後終於痛心地説出來這句話。他是不痛愛兒子麽？不。但他又恐懼年終的歉收，他怕那不幸的結局，因而他忍不住説出這樣苛薄的話語。</p>
<p>兒子死釘着爹爹的臉，没有回話，僅只呌了一聲「爹」，這雖只是一個字，却含有一番説不出口的隠痛在着。媽媽替兒子鳴着不平，很很地説：</p>
<p>「你還不讓他吃飽麽，不吃飽那來的力氣！没有力氣能作田麽？有車水麽？」</p>
<p>吃過飯太陽已經沉入西方的樹梢後，王阿興也不歇息，竟然忘記了每天飯後照例要抽的一遍旱烟，催着兒子一道走出家門。</p>

<p>— 星野</p>
<p>在一百五十年以前，這個「太平洋的樂國」，還不曾爲世界所知道。本來她是一個王國。王國歸併入美國，已有三千多年。現在夏威夷故君的銅像，還依舊巍立港口，受當地人民膜拜。島上的種族，非常複雜，黄的，白的，棕的，褐的，繪成了東西混合的圖畫。在三十六萬人口之中，日本人便佔住了十四萬，差不多在八個夏威夷居民中，便有三個日本人。亞洲人方面，更有六萬菲列賓，三萬中國人，三千高麗人。歐洲人方面，葡萄牙人三萬，英國，美國，德國，及俄羅斯人大約四萬。至於純粹的夏威夷人，本來有二十萬之多，但現在只剩了二萬了。夏威夷人和歐洲人的混合種，約有一萬五千；與亞洲人的混合種，約有一萬二千。由上面　些數字看來，夏威夷人種的複雜，也很够引起好奇者的興趣了。</p>
<p>輪船停在港口，你便可以聞到夏威夷植物一種特有的香味。黄黑色皮膚的本地女郎，散披着漆黑的頭髮，用健而美的四肢，在海灘前游泳。海水是碧綠的，太陽照在沙灘上，反射出像孔雀尾一樣的色圈。當晚上七小時以後，微微的海風，很凉爽而溫柔的拂着全港。夏威夷一天中最好的時間，於是時開始。山上山下，電燈像繁星般在黑夜中輝耀。我便在這個時候，雇着一輛汽車，在島的四圍開駛。夏威夷的馬路，造得非常精緻，道旁低低的小屋，多是日本人開的舖子。許多年輕的女郎，穿着蟬翼樣的薄羅的衣裳，在街上東西南北的閒走。圜臉的是日本人。黑色臂膀的是夏威夷人，穿着分又旗袍的是廣東人，又高又大，前胸挺着的是美國人。他們都很悠閒自得。尤其是小巧身軀的中國人和日本人，好像燕子一樣的輕，小鯽魚一樣的游來泳去，在享受着清夜的微　，和椰子樹下特有的沉靜空氣。</p>
<p>夏威夷的海灘，是世界最出名的游泳地點。可惜我來得太晚，只能在沙灘上走了幾步，鞋裏面帶來許多細粒白沙。灘邊的小店，電燈開得雪亮，有不少青年男女，在那邊狂歡狂飲。數里以外，更有一個「夏威夷村」，那是一個露天的跳舞塲，一切佈置，完全是土人的原來樣子。村的週圍，是很高的椰子樹，樹下點着椰子油的燈，許多八九齡的夏威夷童子，赤身披着紅布，來做招待。村内有四五個跳舞女郎，大半也是夏威夷種。她們披着用草編成的裙子，在跳舞着柔肢軟體的本地舞蹈，他們所唱的歌，靡靡中還帶着幽美，有時歌中也揷着幾句英文。着舞的大概是船上的客人。美國人最喜奇特·所以在椰子樹下大舞大笑的人，大部份都是在紐約看慣了跳舞的來客。</p>

<p>— 堯</p>
<p>據南京中央研究天文所公佈本月二十六日將有「月蝕」，查二十六日適爲廢曆六月十五日，俗爲月半，不待消息之傳來，人民早已籌備着是日之慶祝大典。</p>
<p>「月蝕」俗謂「吃月亮，所以我國古之造字家也深知以後將有所「月蝕」的事情發生，早已代我們兒孫打算着，把「食虫」合爲一字來形容這麽一回事。普通的下層階級地民衆，腦裏深印着每年將有一次「黑月亮吃白月亮」的一回事，他們不知道「月蝕」「不月蝕」底歷來祗知道老年者曾告訴他們，這「月吃月」的一回事，是很恐怖的，假如這「白月給黑月」吃進了不出來，這個世界馬上就會滅忘的…………。所以要來齋物慶祝，放砲竹，打鑼，來嚇走這個「黑月亮」，如果嚇不走，那就糟了，社會卽刻就會不亂，世界上就没有太平的日子了！………。他們這種不科學的理解，正實足代表了半封建的次殖民地而被帝國資本主義經濟侵略間接統治的中國，整個底暴露了這不合法的現社會的組織。</p>
<p>「月蝕日」各處地民衆熱烈的打着鑼，大放砲竹，風雲緊急，好似一二八白川大將陣亡消息傳布時同樣嚴重的狀態。必迫！的空氣佈滿了滬地各街道，從晚七時許起直至九時許，這中間足足有二個小時是極嚴重的時期。總算徼倖如願了民衆的意思，白月没有給黑月吃掉；否則，世界不知將像什麽樣子。同時正可以表示鑼鼓和砲竹的力是足以嚇走了那個「黑月亮」的，合如「活佛張天師設壇求雨，總允給他求下了幾次，顯了他們的法力…………」彷彿似的。</p>
<p>整個中國的社會經濟，在給資本帝國主義嚴重侵略下的今日，農村經濟破産的波浪已開始傳進都市，可是在這種狀態之下，人民依舊没有覺悟性，在平時不得一飽的末落階級和小資産階級「月蝕日」感覺有無限的興奮，正如在大世界天韻樓等游戲塲似的，寗願苦了自已將錢用來慶祝，麻醉自已認爲有意義的一晚，另一方面却給爆竹齋物商人做了一筆應時生意，增加了他個人的腰包到也是一舉兩得的事。</p>
<h3 id="c265">從學生作强盜説起 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>日前報載滬西凱旋路，一西婦被盜匪四名所刧，後巡捕弋獲盜匪一名，據供行刦四人向來都是讀書的學生云云。此一事實出現在上海社會裏，本不足奇，我想一般讀報的人，必多馬虎的在眼底一晃就漾過去了，不會像姦情一類的低級新聞之足惹人注目，這也爲的是上海人的環境特殊所致。當一晃的時候，更不會去展開它的究竟與結果，那當然更是意中之事。</p>
<p>然而，在較爲認眞的一般人看來，却覺得這不但值得我們注目，而且值得我們去悉民心研究，</p>
<p>中國辦了幾十年來的新敎育，到現在，多少人在喊着「敎育破産」，這種學生行刦的事件的演出，這還不是第一次，才眞正打起了這破産現象的旗面，很痛心的印證在我們的眼裏。</p>
<p>敎育儘管辦下去，學校儘管年年增多，無非製造出一大羣的高等遊民，這是什麽原故呢？癥結是如此：（一）視敎育爲獨立的事業，只管爲敎育而辦敎育，没有注意到敎育與社會的關聯，所以弄出畸形的現象。（二）視敎育爲「營私」機會，不顧到敎育的目的，不顧到敎育的出路。（三）因緣於第二點，一般從事敎育的人，大家向都市裏跑，愛在都市裏辦敎育，不願到廣大的農村去，辦敎育，</p>
<p>廣大的農村裏，成羣的基本國民，有的很徼倖的在迂夫子們面前吟幾句「白眼文」，如三字經之類，實際上還是有眼瞎子，與文盲仍舊一樣。</p>
<p>另一方面，一批一批的中學大學畢業出來的學生，又向那裏去呢？社會上是没法安揷，安揷不了。</p>
<p>中學生還有一部分學生，父兄存着一顆溫熱的心，自已也抱着一個偌大的希望，從中學的後門出來，快步的就踏上大學的前階，此種還算是幸福兒，百分之中不知佔着多少。</p>
<p>然而大學畢業了，却千眞萬確的只有死路可走。然而有誰敢，誰願意去走死路？於是事實便這樣展開：</p>
<p>很少數，因爲仗着祖父的厚蔭，一拐兒跑到外國去，留學去，這是天之驕子，能有幾人。其次惟有回到老家去吃老米飯，檸黄臉老婆的大腿，喂小孩的飲食，抱小核玩耍，我有好幾位大學畢業了的朋友就是這樣。再有一大批，頗具愧赧的心理，覺得大學畢業了而竟没有出路，還説回家去吃老米，那眞是寗願餓死都市犯不着。然而果眞去餓死麽，却又不能，於是花樣出來了，甚麽危險的勾當，都去冒險嘗試。</p>
<p>作强盜不過是其中的一種。請試睜圓眼睛看看，社會上有多少罪惡的事，有許多是向來讀書的學生們弄出來的。　　問題是這樣的嚴重，究竟怎樣解决，這種責任試問誰負的呢？</p>

<p>日本文人廚川白村氏，在他的著作「遊美印象記」裏，曾這樣説過：「進飯廳的時候，女跑在前，男的唯恭唯敬地跟在後頭，這是美國夫婦；女的跟男的，一邊談笑，一邊環住手跑着的，這是法國夫婦；男的挺着胸突着肚跑在前面，女的跟在他後頭的，這是英國夫婦。」（大意如此）廚川白村氏所以引出這個例子，看他的意思，大致是贊美美國男子的「尊重女性」，别國的男子是跟不上他們的，所以廚川白村氏還這樣肯定的説：「美國是女子的黄金國！」</p>
<p>自從歐風吹進了我們這古老的國家</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，「尊重女性」的事似乎我們也注意過了，但也只是注意而已，在實行方面，因爲一般人們智識程度的不均衡。於是就不能得到普遍的效果；譬如常常在電車上面，我們便看見過女的伸出短短的手吊住籐圜，男的泰然的坐在座位上。這事雖小，却也足以表示一般人尙未了解「尊重女性」是什麽一回事。</p>
<p>今晚工作完畢，當我跑到馬路上時，看見路旁有一對青年男女在吵架，男的穿着挺漂致的西裝，女的看來也是一個受過敎養的女子。他倆最初只是吵着吵着，吵到頂點的時候，却打起架來了；結果是女性的打不過男的，男的只是一拳一拳的向女的打過去。這時候，圍攏來看熱鬧的人們中，有一個血氣旺盛的年青人，挺身而出，不但爲女的解圍，却也望男的一拳一拳打過去。原先跟女的吵架的那人，顯然是比較文弱，不能不退後到牆壁脚去，一邊還喊着：</p>
<p>「我們是自家人，你别管閒事！」</p>
<p>那血氣旺盛的年青人却答得巧妙：「不管你們是不是自家人，你在外面打女人我們就要打轉你；你們旣是自家人，有事何不回家去理論，街上打什麽架？」</p>
<p>還是女的跑出來解圍，這事方告結束了！</p>
<p>這事有什麽意義哩？爲什麽我要提出來説哩？無他，這也是表示着：尙有一些人是了解尊重女性的。</p>
<p>「尊重女生，」一定還有些人要反對，他們會這麽説：「爲什麽要尊重女性？不是大家平等就好嗎？我們不要像以前一樣壓迫女性就好了！」可是，這般人却忘記了女性的特點：因爲她們在生理上，在體力上，經過了學者們的證明，是遠不如男人的；所以男人，不單是像易方朔那種人，有了一妻三妾而還要娶一個十三歲的女孩爲第四妾的事我們要極力反對，就是讓一個女人站在顚簸的電車裏，男的却泰然的坐着的事，我們也要反對的！前者是使男女的地位得以平等，後者便明明是含着「尊重女性」的意味了！</p>
<p>雖然，男人應該處處的「尊重女性」，而女的却也不應該以爲得到了男人的尊重，便處處表現出傲態，目空一切了！</p>

<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>住在喧囂擾攘的大都市裏，而又享受不到都市文明的清福的人們，往常總在渴慕着幽閒清靜的農村生活。在他們的腦子中常想着：在春天，遍野都是鮮艷的花朶，滿溪滿澗都是清靜的流水，可愛；在夏季，到處都是青翠滴的林叢，吱吱唱和的鳴蟬，可愛；及至滿地落葉的深秋，遍山遍野白雪的殘冬，那種蒼凉嚴肅的是景象，也覺可愛。如是個詩人，只要到那裏逛上幾天，就能帶回不少令人魂銷的詩篇，如是個散文家，只要坐在東廂裏，探頭外面看看兩旁的原野，也就能寫成許多令人神往的小品了！（許多遊記小品之類，就是這樣寫成的）。</p>
<p>但是，農村到底眞的像人們腦子中所想像的，詩人筆下所描畫的那樣美麗嗎？這恐也只是坐在轎子裏，聽了依啞的水車聲，就忙的吟哦着「和風送得桔槹聲」，這樣動人的詩句：像魯迅在「風波」中所寫的，坐在酒船上，探頭看見摇着大芭蕉在閒談着的鄉人，立就大發詩興，説：　無思無慮，這眞是田家樂呵」！這種浮面的觀察吧！至於九斤老太説的是什麽話，他們是聽不到的，農民們一年到頭忙的不了，還過不得活的情形，他們是未曾看見，——或不願意看見的。</p>
<p>「復興農村」，「到農村去」，……這些口號，前些時，是曾經一通很響亮的呌過的：但，這也只是大家高興時，才來呌呌而已，從來看見誰個動手來實行過；甚且，時至現在，連呌也覺得厭煩，無味，而漸行靜寞了　！——或許農村的興衰，與這些睡在都市裏來讚歎農村的人，原就没有多大關係的！</p>
<p>現在，把農村描畫成世外桃源的遊記，將農民生活刻畫得多麽悠閒自適的詩篇，又是到處都可看見了；這那呌人不歎佩這班藝術家們想像力的高强處呢！</p>

<p>在女人中間，以奶奶階級爲最無用。生活費靠老爺挣來；烹茶弄飯，掃地，抹桌子，洗衣服，折疊被窩，要假手於老媽子；過河買船票，上電影院買門票，要弟弟妹妹效勞。……總之，除了吃飯，抹牌時，少不了要勞動兩隻玉手外，其餘的時間，最好長躺在摇椅上，呌婢女們來捻腿子舒服。</p>
<p>奶奶的前身，有些是舊式的小姐，有些是新式的女學生，有些是摩登的交際花。但是，舊式小姐會做女紅，新式女學生會打乒乓球，織洋繩子衣服，摩登交際花會行握手禮，算來也不是毫無用處的；惟一變而爲奶奶階級後，行握手禮則怕害羞，做女紅織衣服是不耐煩，打乒乓球則没有氣力。一句話，女人做了奶奶後，根本就成了一架無用的廢物。</p>
<p>奶奶可憐論</p>
<p>然奶奶們，又是女人中間最可憐者。</p>
<p>小姑娘，可以蹦蹦跳跳，老太婆，可以嘻嘻哈哈；而奶奶們不能焉。</p>
<p>奶奶階級自身没有幸福，以老爺階級之幸福爲幸福。世上的老爺們，不能個個有幸福：而老爺的幸福，有些是要分給父母，有些要分給兒女，有些要分給朋友，甚至於有些要分給敵人。故就整個的奶奶階級言，眞是無絲毫幸福可言。</p>
<p>老媽子感着工作厭倦不高興幹了，馬上就可以尋找新的，婢女受了委曲，亦可以私自逃走。惟奶奶階級的運命，則是被註定了的：新的環境不容易找，逃走嗎？那有勇氣？所以奶奶階級的苦，是要一輩子吃下去。</p>
<p>奶奶造孽論</p>
<p>其實奶奶階級，是一個造孽作惡的階級。</p>
<p>屬於老爺這個階級的人們，除了極少數外，大都在社會上有「正經事」可幹的：社會如失掉了男子們的活動，則這個社會馬上就會死滅。但是奶奶階級就不肯顧全這個大局，她們不管三七二十一，總希望把自已的老爺具年長月的摟在懷裏心吓肝吓的她們才認爲是幸福，她們只曉得充實自已的小世界，不知在自已小世界外，還有一個大大天。</p>
<p>拿破崙説：「女子是一副生兒子的機器」！但是有許多奶奶們太不識相了，自已的環境不容養育兒子，她居然把兒子生出，甚至接二連三的儘量生下去。這就要影響老爺的事業，加重過活的負担。社會上有許多男子都是因爲得要瞻養家庭而犯了罪。這筆賬，不能不爲在奶奶階級上。</p>
<p>然奶奶階級如果都不會生兒，則人數又未免要絶滅：所以不生兒子，也是罪惡。</p>

<p>據説南京中央軍官學校的游泳池，「近來每至夜間，輒有哭聲，同時水浪亦頗響動」。據聞「該游泳池，日前曾溺斃九期學生一人」。於是「上項消息，是否卽因是而起」，雖「殊不可知」；惟證之「前次天氣炎熱時，常有學生或勤務兵等，夜間偷至池旁鼾息納凉，近已無人前往」云云，眞是「事出有因」，「查有實據」的奇蹟，「眞值得科學家之研究」了。</p>
<p>中國雖是古文明國之先進，可是科學却並不怎麽昌明。就有幾位科學家，恐怕也是忙於國家大事，决没有工夫來研究這些「未知生焉知死」的無聊問題，或免强地研究了仍舊拿出塊無鬼論的招牌來敷衍一下，而没有什麽足以鎭邪搜鬼的法寳來治他；讓該溺斃的九期學生某冤鬼，依然肆無忌憚地搗鬼下去，弄得學生不能安心地練習泅術，勤務兵不敢偷來鼾息納凉，可怎麽辦呢？而且月初，我們的中國小姐，美人魚楊女士從南是獻技回來，不是要在京中表演嗎？該鬼若膽敢興波作浪，以楊小姐的健勇，固然不甚要緊。可是要「哭泣甚哀」的話，那英雄涙難保不驚碎美人兒的芳心呢。</p>
<p>因此，我敢學廣州劉日東同志的禁止男女同游與同行的條陳法，獻一個方策道。</p>
<p>首先請我國六十三代張天師到南京去設壇畟法，將該水中的九期生某，追薦超渡，俾脱鬼蜮，永登仙籙，敕封該池龍王，鎭守該池。那末不但該池水致再有溺死與作祟情事，就是此後若逢天旱，南京居民還可以多一　雨龍王，好多沛幾寸甘霖了。</p>
<h3 id="c271">故居 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 白舍</p>
<p>懷念故居的一份心兒是三年來没有一天不存着的，但是祗限於懷念罷了。兩個月以前，我從南國的一個水城趁船到上海來，第四天的早晨便進吳淞口了，吳淞口的敗亂與愴凉都是預期的，但是我却爬到了船桅的繩梯上，伸長着　子向着我的故居望，黑烟在我的面前的攪動，那時似乎在綠樹林的後邊露出了一塊白牆，一個小窓，但是待我再要仔細看時，却又並没有什麽可以見到的。故居曾遭砲擊，自然是千眞萬確的事情，不過我總不能够相信我的故居也會和别個建築一樣地已經潰爛，像一堆廢墟，甚至如同踏平了的荒墳。</p>
<p>最近我從上海搬到一個小街上來住，心中便有着一陣懽欣，一陣悲痛，因爲這裏距我故居業已很近。在我每一次坐車到火車站去，總得在故居的左近經過，每在經過的時候，我總把頭扭轉着看，這時我的人兒雖然坐在車上，心兒早便離開了，我恨人生爲什麽要這樣地愴惶？連經過故居的時候都不能一看故居。</p>
<p>但是機會終於有一天要來到，在一個炎熱逼人的下午，我便僱車往故居的附近，也不知由於什麽心理的驅使，我在未到故居之前便下了車子，在荒草亂石間辨認了舊時光的道路，很快地走向慣走的地叚。卵石路上似乎没有那時的光了，自然是由於行人稀少的原因，小水塘裏的水已經乾涸，我也不敢再侈求這裏會傳出喧鬧的蛙聲。我轉了一個彎兒，脚的經騐告訴我這已經是故居的所在了，但是我却還向着前面行進，行不幾步，又後打轉了，因爲望前去，更不像是我的故居了。</p>
<p>朝西邊望去，矮林和我眼睛的角度與距離證明我已站在故居的門前，矮林前已不見少男少女的步履，回過頭來一看，是誰，給我頭上潑了一桶冷水？我的天啊，這没有了門，没有了屋頂，没有了……光光的一片空曠，你呌我怎麽相信，你呌我怎麽相住，相信這是我的故居？</p>
<p>幾片碎磚，這是我掛着畫幅的粉牆嗎？幾枝小草，這就是我的財物的一切嗎？焦土，是晚的生命的痕迹嗎？是嗎？是嗎？是的啊！媽媽的，眞果是的嗎</p>
<p>這裏就是我披着黑衣作畫的地方嗎？這裏就我和我的好友們開着殷紅的葡萄酒的地方嗎？是的，綠電燈在桌子上就像一瓣荷葉，那麽綠電燈呢？我何曾不知道世間的一切是都會變的，百年前的樂園會做了拘禁囚犯的牢獄，荒土下邊，也會造起了華貴的舞榭，但是我的故居啊，你總變得太快了吧，是的，我的故居是不久以前才從荒土上造起，不久之後又復打成灰烟，我的故居，你不覺得你存在的時日太短促，你變得太快了嗎？</p>
<p>太陽是漸漸地西沉了，這不是我在窓下忘懷了一切在躭心於繪畫的時候了嗎？但是我要哭，我要對着夕陽痛哭，故居呢？故居啊！</p>
<p>再要看見我的故居，除非在懷念中</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個没有深切學識的青年，不過幼時在私塾裏念過七年書的罷。也没有學過甚麽工藝，簡直連學徒的生活都没有做過。現在有一件事求先生加意的指導。</p>
<p>無學無識的我，想在社會上謀一較優的位置，不消説是困難到極點。所以數年以來，總是在家裏閒着。現在可説時運亨通，得到某某公司裏一個做文牘員的朋友的介紹，我到他的公司裏做文牘員了。這當然是喜出望外的，但像我這樣的程度，那裏能够稱職呢，因此我就回覆了一句，恐怕没有這樣能力罷」！他立刻回覆説，「不要緊的，一切事情我可相助你呢。於是就做了這公司的文牘員，到現在已經兩個月了。説起來也慚愧，眞的兩個月來的文件，除了簡單的少許外，全賴他來相助成功的。但仔細一想，長此依賴旁人，雖則他是自願相助，日久被主任先生知道，畢竟難勉被逐出的。因此我想用公餘之暇來自修。據同事説，在這裏爲文牘員，也不是難　，祗要具有高中程度就够應付了。但是我這樣的程度修至高中程度最快需要多少時間呢？我現在的程度等於若何程度呢？自修的文學課本那幾本最爲完善呢？自修的程序法子怎樣纔妥善呢？以上的問題都是我目前急需知道的。請先生給予我解答吧！倘先生還有比自修更好的方法，還請予我加意的指導。這是我十二分的感謝你了。此祝</p>
<p>撰安　　劉少安謹上</p>
<p>答：你旣有這樣好的朋友，肯出心出力的提拔你，機會是極難得的。所以，在這時候，你的確應當努力自修，設法趕上。一個人祗要有决心，有毅力，什麽事都學得會，學得好，照你現在的學力程度，固然是幼稚，但你决不是没有學習文牘的資格。你現在一方面練習，一方面就可應用，况且，又有那位好朋友，可以請他從旁指敎你，所以你的學習，較之一般人自修公牘，要切實些，進步也要迅速些。至於高中程度，　原是一句籠統的説話，實際上會做公文祗要國文通順再熟習公文的程式，就可動手，在高中裏所讀的其他學科大都是用不着的，所以，你現在直接去學習公文好了，不必再兜圈子，去「修至高中程度」的學力。練習公文不是死習範本所可奏效，也不是死記一些套語，就可應用主要的是多看目前來往的文牘，同時再自已提起勇氣，嘗試一下，等到自已做好後，覺得不妥當，地你再去參看範本，看看自已的毛病在那裏，這樣，進步就很快了。會文堂所出的「現行公文程式詳解一這本書還好，你可購備」本作參考之用。</p>

<p>跳上磅機，一個大眼睛的美麗的面形映在他面前的玻璃鏡裏。旋過頭去，兩個驚恐着「呀」了出來。</p>
<p>「多久不見了。」</p>
<p>「是。買一點東西。」</p>
<p>一個在前，一個在後，像會意地，向化妝品部走去。</p>
<p>女職員笑容可掬地迎接他們。她俯近向玻璃櫃選擇她需要的香品，那個站在背後，露出頭來，彷彿一對新婚的夫婦。</p>
<p>「這。」她伸出纖纖的食指指着玻璃櫃裏一個精美的粉盒。</p>
<p>「這是飛斯蓓之。」他頭凑得璨近一點。</p>
<p>女職員忙授出來説：「這牌子到上海還没有兩個月，價錢也便宜；」她翻過盒底來「四元九角半。」</p>
<p>「好的，拿兩盒，」她敏捷地從手提袋内抽出一張十元鈔票。</p>
<p>那個從褲袋裏掏出手帕來掩了掩鼻子。</p>
<p>從化妝品到手帕部，一個在前，一個在後。</p>
<p>這樣，那樣，她選了幾種花色的手帕，最後揀了一條最大的絲質的對他説；「你也買一條嗎？」</p>

<p>從手帕部慢慢的走向前去，他問；</p>
<p>「還有什麽東西要買？」</p>

<h3 id="c274">「電影大衆語」檢討聲中之三面觀 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 莫衰</p>
<p>無論它是「文白戰爭」之下的産物。無論它是少數「特殊者羣」的發現。「大衆」語·文·的建設，是爲着「大衆」的能説，能懂，能寫，能讀；「統一語文」這個確切的需要；至少是值得我們來登高一呼的。</p>
<p>事實上我們看見些什麽呢？白紙黑字上面，給予我們一些抽象的論調；别説，這是國人的「慣技」。</p>
<p>最近本刊對於「大衆語」與雷影的檢討文章，給我們讀得够了。炳颺先生在「大衆語與電影題材」一文内説：假如我們所採取的題材，是以江南某某農邨爲中心的，那在這裏我們就不能完全使用「國語」在這裏我們就不得不引用若干方言和土語……但丹楓先生一篇「大衆語在電影中之運用」中的意思又説：大衆語旣非「文言」「白話」，更非「方言」「土語」是另有一個方式的建造可是也不過僅僅舉例説了一句「天不下雨，怎麽辦？」</p>
<p>唐納先生因着丹楓先生在文中寫了一句「在目前我們極力反對廣東語對白的聲片之攝製」也來了一大篇聲討，原因是唐納先生在每日電影裏發表過一篇「粤語聲片與大衆語建設」，他是贊同製片家攝製粤語片的；不過也有許多地方是説了偏面的話。例如：「照丹楓先生的説法，現在在電影上提倡國語可以帮助文言的消滅，可是結果廣東觀衆不懂國語，怕不要像不懂英語而看英美聲片一樣的隔膜和難理解」那末照唐納先生的説法，廣東聲片給不解粤語的觀衆看了，就不會像不懂英語而看英美聲片同樣的發生隔膜，難理解麽？以事實來講，在目下的中國，被認爲官話式的國語，至少要比廣東方言普遍一些吧。</p>
<p>大衆語在電影的建設上，已形成如下的三種理論：（一）是炳颺先生的以「方言「「土語」的混入「國語」而成「大衆語」，這是一件不可能的事：事實上我們特殊的中國，一省有一省的「方言」「土語」，一鄉有一鄉的「方言」「土語」，甚至每每一城市南門－北門東門－西門的言語可以找出許多許多絶對不同的話來。因着「方言　」「土語」的不統一，當然甲地的語言，在乙地的人就完全不能聽得懂；如果我們的電影題材是以某某農邨爲中心而混入該地「方言土語」的話，將來拍攝的電影，也祗可限於在某某農邨放映了，除非再另譯其他農邨的「方言」「土語」在另一個放映的所在。</p>
<p>（二）是丹楓先生的非「文言」「白話」「方言」「土語」，而需要建造另一簡而易解的語句在電影的運用裏的所謂「大衆語」，但在未開始建造出什麽東西來之前，我們暫可不談。</p>
<p>（三）是唐納先生主張高度發展「方言」的溶化，使它成爲自然化的大衆語（詳本刊二十三四兩日唐納先生原著）不過事實上不會像唐納先生的理想，説得這樣輕鬆而這樣單純的。譬如就以「粤語聲片」來説，第一這「粤語聲片」是否能呌非粤籍的大衆去欣賞？第二設或偶而一觀，是否能使它們澈底地了解？第三卽使能一知半解，是否能使他們在廣東語言和本人語言發生溶化的作用？這是很應該注意的一件事，何况我們不能單拿一二處「方言」來使它高度的溶化，便認爲是「大衆語」，我們應當拿全國的「方言」來溶化，才算是符合唐納先生所説的所謂自然生長的「統一國語」；那末中國小而言之數十種，擴而主允之數百種方言，需要同時高度發展，恐怕全中國的電影公司，也不够支配吧？如果一時來一部廣東片，一時來一部江西片，那時更弄得非驢非馬，進退兩難了。</p>
<p>末後我得説：在這時我們可以先把「大衆語」這個美名，完全放棄。我們來幹統一語文的工作，我主張少些「高談闊論」多些「埋頭苦幹」。我們希望每個人去實施每個人的主張。若干年以後，誰的主張是幹到統一語文成功了的一天；也便是「大衆語」誕生的一天；也便是誰主張創造「大衆語」到達「勝利」目的的一天。</p>
<h3 id="c275">悼曼麗特蘭漱 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>據聖巴巴拉傳來的消息，説是經過一度苦病之後，老明星曼麗特蘭漱，終於在二十八日的那天逝世了，享年六十一歲。曼麗特蘭漱，這次所患的病，非常的複雜，包括心病和腎臟病。她在患病期内，已死去過兩次，但都復蘇的。直到這一次她才不能再爲生命而挣扎了。她在一八七三年十一月九日，誕生於加拿大到一八八六年便獻身舞臺，第一次與觀衆見面。那時她祗十三歲。她對於她的職業，肯專心去研究一直到了一九一四年，才投身電影界。後來又曾有一度脱離影界，重上舞臺。Tillie's　Punclured　Romance是一部笑劇，也是她所拍攝的第一張影片，接着Tuyboat　Anine要算最成功的作品。在她所主演的影片之中，她工作非常熱心，所需要她的，她什麽都願意去帮忙。她所主演的影片，已有不少的成功，直到現在她已日好萊塢最可愛的明星了。幾百萬的電影觀衆聽見了她逝世的消息，誰都要非常的憐惜。這位大明星的故世，好萊塢多少要受一些重大的損失吧？</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱是死了，然而在這個世界上，對於她的印象，却是永不磨滅的。我們相信，至少在這個二十世紀中，民有的人，將不會遺忘她所給予的深刻印象，她的私生活，正和銀幕上相同，充滿了愉快的色彩。自十三歲加入貝納脱麻爾登劇團，表演戲劇，恰在十九世紀末葉，以迄於最近，所演的Her　Sweetheart一片爲止，她的印象，早已深入全世界的人心了。她的電影生活，開始在麥克桑納脱在最成名的時代，和她訂了合同，主演Tillie'　Puncturod　Romance以後才得成名。接着她所主演的名片，有Anna　Christia　Emma　Min　a　nd　Bill　Tugboat　Annie　却有相當的成功，而也許最成功的作品便是最近的Dinner　At　Eight了。和她交情很密的朋友很多，而且其中又有好多是名人，她對待朋友正和她在銀幕上一樣，非常誠懇而眞摯的。對於慈善事業，生平更最喜贊助。整千萬的影迷，在這世界上，知道了曼麗特蘭漱的死耗，將誰都要惋惜，而幾千個和她相熟的人，更將爲她悲悼呢！</p>
<p>「柳暗花明」一片，爲新進明星康絲登柯敏斯所主演，故事悲歡並俱，演出非常動人，不日將在國泰開映。</p>
<h3 id="c276">麗琳哈蕙生平 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 海青</p>
<p>偉大，耐苦的麗琳哈蕙是成功的了。她拍片的衆多給人深刻的印像。她的歌喉，舞態更沉醉了幾多人！看了她嬌小的身段，總以爲是個多病的林黛玉了，但不，她却是運動界的大明星呢！她會拍球，游泳，走繩，滑冰。最難得的她能騎劣性的馬，她有不可屈的毅力；前進的精神；這一切助成了她目前的聲譽。每天她終是很忙的奔走，就在家裏也是不好靜的，尤其是有記者們來探問，來替她拍照時。</p>
<p>麗琳哈蕙她的作颼，小鳥依人般的神態，孩子般的脾氣，差不多每張片子裏都能看見的。更爲了有天賦的歌喉，所以在她的片子裏，清歌一曲總不會少的。「龍翔鳳舞」·「桃花村」，「鳳求凰」等都能切合她和個性盡量發展表演出來。她很合乎那些輕鬆而帶歌舞的作品，而每次的演出終不會使人失望的。</p>
<p>她生在倫敦，今年已是二十七歲了。她原是德國人，但母親却是英籍，她除了英德文之外更會説法文。所以她的片子，是有時英文，有時德文，有時法文，但都同樣的流利可喜的。</p>

<p>黎灼灼由香港來滬。本來是預備担任聯華三廠楊小仲導演的「漩渦」女主角，但黎因香港有戲拍不得已而返香港，所以「漩渦」的角色便另選了旁人。黎灼灼是善游泳的，她的游泳技術在「破浪」裏曾一現身手，但據人説她在那裏並没能盡量發揮。她此次到滬，在寒暑表一百多度的那些天，她天天早晨就跑到蘭園游泳池去，她的種種游泳技巧的表現、的確是高得多。聯華同人因此都呼她美人魚第二，尤其是林楚楚，陳燕燕，黎鏗等，因見她游技的精敏都非常羨慕，所以一同去游泳時，他們要灼灼做出幾種姿式來給他們看，灼灼呢，是很富風趣的，有時也竟要裝做老師的神氣，比如黎鏗游不好，她抱起來就打他的屁股，如今灼灼回香港了，楚楚，燕燕、黎鏗他們都少了一個游泳的伴侣。</p>

<p>— 信之</p>
<p>憶迪的眼睛，四面追尋着克新斯，但是看不見他。她知道克新斯一下是在和那個潘其先生談話哩。克新斯確是正在和潘其談話，但是他談了三五句後之後，他已知道那個談話是多餘的。他已决定了他的後步。潘其是　惟一可以拯救他的人，但是尋遍了潘其的已往的歷史，亦没有發見他對於一位流血垂斃的敵人，能發現些惻隠之心的。潘其是從貧苦之中努力奮鬥出來，以躋於士紳之列的。他是嘗遍了飢寒失望的滋味的。他亦嘗經歷過失敗和慘遇。最後他亦嘗到了勝利的滋味。他有了錢，勢力也有了。朋友亦團聚在他的四周了。機遇亦俯拾即是了。至於宫室的富麗，起居的豪華，尤其小焉者也。但是種種一切的最後，他却没有學到過「仁愛」兩個字。「你聽着，潘其，」这百克新斯最後的請求，「你要是少錘擊我……給我一些喘息的機會……事態並不至於惡化到厲害的程度……我的産業還有不少哩。」潘其毫無人心的説道：「你没有一角錢，不是你已經欠了二十種方法的。不過你不用這樣憂慮，和你同病相憐的，亦正不少哩……亦不盡是像我這樣粗魯之人，儘有許多閲閥世家在其中呐。」克新斯聽了，默然無語。潘其奸笑着，站了起來，開了克新斯陳設精雅的書齋，走到大客廳裏去了。</p>
<p>憶迪在第二次表演之前，急速地換好了衣服，覺得有許多閒暇，就抽空從大羣中溜了出來，偷偷地開了克新斯書齋的門，走了進去。克新斯　正在書桌前坐着。他看見一位不速之客，突然而來，他連忙將開着的抽屜推上了。他在不知不覺中，自已搊着雙手，好像剛才放下了一件冰冷的東西，要將手搊搊熱似的。他神思恍惚，目無所覩的看着憶迪。憶迪媚笑着道：「我恐怕驚擾了你了吧。」他似乎目光清楚些了，他很覺得奇怪地看着他道：「不要緊。」憶迪就老實不客氣地在他的桌子角上坐下了。她嬌嘘着道：「你一定是世界上最快樂的人了。」克新斯苦笑着道：「什麽東西使你這樣想的呢？」憶迪笑道「因爲世界上的東西，你已經是無所不有的了。你看，多末美麗的家室……并且……」她自命聰明地虚擬着：「已經定了親，不久要結婚了。」克新斯似乎很佩服她的小聰明，又笑了一笑道：「我旣没有定親，亦没有結婚。」憶迪彎着腰，凑了上去追問道：「那，你怎樣沈得開的呢？」克新斯縐着眉假作思索之狀説道：「或者是因爲我從來没有遇到過你吧。」他拿出香烟來敬着客，但是憶迪婉却了。他説道：「唔，連這點小罪惡都没有的嗎？」憶迪説道：「人家都説歌女怎樣怎樣的浪漫風騷。不過像我，克新斯先生，我到了百老匯這許多時候了，但是我現在還是和我剛離家的時候一樣。」她拍着克新斯的手。他覺得克新斯有些不相信她的話，她於是嘿然坐了下來，拿了桌上一個小銅人把玩着。她説道：「我亦是醉心於美術的一個人。」（未完）</p>

<p>The Minor Issues in the War Zone Have Been Substantially Resolved</p>
<p>Both Ministries Are Properly Planning Measures to Relieve Drought and Flood Disasters in Various Provinces</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang Zhaoming of the Executive Yuan finished addressing Boy Scout trainers at Central University in Nanjing on the morning of the 30th, a reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about various recent foreign and domestic political issues. President Wang then issued a written statement as follows: (1) Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, has been traveling back and forth this time with the aim of resolving various disputes within the war zone, such as the expulsion and suppression of undesirable elements, and the elimination and reorganization of security teams. Although these are minor issues, the suffering of the people within the war zone is considerable. This time, they have been substantially resolved. As for other issues, such as economic cooperation, they were not mentioned. (2) Vice Minister Tang was recently sent to Moganshan again to urge Commissioner Huang to return to Beiping as soon as possible. Although the central government determines the principles of diplomacy and is responsible for implementing these principles, relying on Commissioner Huang's talent to be stationed and deal with all disputes that have occurred or may occur nearby. (3) Droughts have repeatedly occurred in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, while floods have been reported in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. Regarding the prevention of droughts and floods, we should focus on fundamental construction, but for short-term measures, there is nothing more urgent than regulating food supply and providing work relief. The Ministries of Finance and Industry are currently properly planning measures. (4) Students graduating in Beiping are petitioning in Nanjing for employment issues. The government believes this is an issue that must be paid great attention to. Not only should solutions be sought for each graduate to serve society, but the country's huge expenditure of money to cultivate talents must also be properly allocated so that various social undertakings can be handled by capable people. The Economic Committee originally intended to establish a work consultation office within the education group to achieve the goal of talent control. It is now being promptly established or planned by the Ministry of Education and is currently under review and implementation. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) President Wang cabled the chairmen of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang governments and the mayor of Shanghai on the 29th, saying, "In recent days, farmers in rural areas have been suffering from drought and praying for rain. We cannot help but feel the urgency of their suffering. However, when we think of the lack of popular education and the inability to instill common sense in the general public, we cannot help but feel emotional. Although it is not appropriate to interfere excessively and cause disturbances during their activities, attention should be paid to the enlightenment of common sense before and after the event. Lectures and illustrations should be used in conjunction to explain the prevention of droughts and floods based on scientific principles, and emphasis should be placed on practical experiments to enable people to rely on human efforts to eliminate superstition. As for Shanghai, which is a global transportation hub and where the public's attention is focused, and where the common sense of the citizens is relatively widespread, it is different from rural farmers. However, there are also events such as setting up altars to pray for rain, which is not only superstitious but also close to deception. It is appropriate to prohibit it as soon as possible to quell stubborn feelings. I hope you will comply accordingly." (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Luo Jialun: Solving Youth Employment</p>
<p>Ye Chucang: The Government's Determination to Provide Disaster Relief</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held its 141st memorial week at 8:00 a.m. on the 30th. Central Committee members Ju Zheng and Luo Jialun, and all working comrades, totaling about 500 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided, and Luo Jialun gave a report entitled "Solving Youth Employment and Seeking Political Stability." He briefly stated that after graduating from university, youths are competing to find a way out due to the difficulty of obtaining employment, and some are even going astray, affecting politics. This undesirable situation is not caused by a single reason but is composed of many aspects. In terms of the country and society, the education system and policies are imperfect, the assessment and appointment system is not established, and the social economy is depressed. In terms of schools, the curriculum is scattered, and the status of the school is not valued by the general public. In terms of families, they have not fulfilled their responsibility to guide their children. The youths themselves have not established a good atmosphere, strictly abided by discipline, and worked hard. Taken together, the terrible phenomenon of today has been created. To find a solution, in the author's research, it is believed that it is nothing more than: (1) Implementing planned education, that is, establishing schools and cultivating talents, and planning as a whole with social uses and needs. (2) Establishing a civil service appointment system, that is, rigorously enforcing examinations, so that the able can be selected. After the speech, the meeting adjourned at 9:20.

The Ministry of Communications believes that detouring to Weihai will extend the route by 200 miles, consume a lot of time, and lengthen the working hours of the pilots, which will have an impact on flight safety. In addition, the area is remote and close to the sea, and there may not be many passengers, and the number of mail items will be sparse. For the sake of facilitating air transportation between Shanghai and Beiping and seeking time economy, there is currently no need to detour to Weihai. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

Regarding the train crash in Beidaihe on the night of the 28th and the rumors that Zheng and Wang were injured, Zheng stated today that there was no such thing.

Yin Tong's wife suffered a cut on her forehead in the car. He and Wang were not injured. Zheng Baozhao said that he went to Yuguan to inspect the railway line's situation because what he is in charge of is the affairs of the Railway Bureau's Improvement Committee. Recently, he discovered that there are points that need improvement in the traffic, so he went to various stations to investigate. It is certainly not the case that he went to Yuguan to meet with the Japanese side, because Director Yin handles foreign affairs himself, and he never inquires about them. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Ningxia talked about the area of several hundred miles north of Dengkou around Sansheng Palace, which has always been within the sphere of influence of the Catholic Church. Westerners only pay 2,000 yuan in rent to the Mongolian king every year and then own the land there, earning 400,000 yuan a year. They also force local residents to convert to Christianity. The priests have become the actual rulers there, and the power of the official authorities is extremely weak. Now, all parties in Ningxia hope that the central government can recover it as soon as possible to protect national rights. According to Wang Daliaaya of the Alxa Banner, who is currently staying in Beiping, Sansheng Palace was originally under the jurisdiction of the banner. The lease to the church began during the Boxer Rebellion. The treaty signed at that time is still in his hands. According to the treaty, it is very easy to recover. It is currently planned to recover it to allow the Mongolian people to learn farming, and preparations are currently underway. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession issued the new regulations for rickshaw licenses, the Rickshaw Trade Association immediately threatened resistance. Recently, the craze has escalated, and the situation is severe. This matter concerns the livelihood of 140,000 common people and deserves attention. According to the Municipal Council's decision, from August onwards, those applying for rickshaw licenses must first submit the vehicle owner certificate issued by the Management Committee for verification. Before obtaining the vehicle owner certificate, they must declare their willingness to abide by the new regulations. The content of the new regulations is based on clauses 4 to 16 of the Rickshaw Committee's recommendations, which were approved by the Municipal Council Board. In summary, they are: (1) Implement vehicle owner registration as soon as possible. (2) Establish a rickshaw puller registration system. (3) Stipulate a maximum rental of 80 cents per 24 hours for public rickshaws. (4) Set fares at 20 cents per mile and 60 cents per hour. (5) Crack down on illegal chartered rickshaws. This resistance craze is mainly led by the Trade Association, organized by rickshaw owners. Upon closer inspection of the new regulations, the items most directly affecting the interests of rickshaw owners are only vehicle owner registration and the reduction of rickshaw rental fees.</p>
<p>Before discussing the rights and wrongs of this matter, we should first acknowledge that there is indeed a need to improve the current rickshaw system and the lives of rickshaw pullers. However, the Municipal Council and the Trade Association clearly have different approaches to improvement. According to the Municipal Council's observations, the shortcomings of the current system are mostly due to the control of licenses in the hands of a few, allowing them to monopolize the market. This leaves helpless rickshaw pullers exploited and with no recourse. It is said that since 1924, when the Municipal Council limited the number of licenses for traffic management purposes, three major drawbacks have emerged: (1) License holders have gained monopolistic value, causing rickshaw pullers to pay high rental prices. (2) The emergence of "illegal" chartered rickshaws. (3) The style of rickshaws in the Public Concession is inferior to that of other cities. Therefore, the main target of the Municipal Council's new regulations is to crack down on the illegal monopoly and sale of licenses. The Trade Association, which the Rickshaw Committee report identifies as controlling the buying and selling of licenses, is therefore the first to be affected. Conversely, the Trade Association only admits that "some rickshaw owners sell their vehicles when they change careers due to certain reasons, but there should absolutely not be any buying and selling of licenses alone." (See Mr. Yin Zhiling's speech in this newspaper on March 21st.) If this is true, then the opposition to vehicle owner registration seems to be a shot in the dark. This point is a matter of fact and cannot be forcibly concealed.</p>
<p>We believe that since the Trade Association and rickshaw owners in general do not admit to the buying and selling of licenses, the main reason for opposing the new regulations lies only in the reduction of rickshaw rental fees. However, based on reality, there is still room for negotiation on the issue of rent reduction. It is said that the Municipal Council initially planned to reduce the rent to 80 cents per day from July 1st, but later postponed it to August 1st and changed it to 100 cents per day. Only on January 1st of next year will it be reduced to 80 cents. This shows that the Municipal Council has not insisted on its original proposal. The Trade Association also admits that there is a need to appropriately reduce rickshaw rental fees and has submitted a letter to the Municipal Council proposing a reduction to 120 cents. This indicates that both parties feel that the current rickshaw rental fees are too high, and the difference lies in the amount of reduction, not the principle of reduction. If a way can be found to abolish the "baotou" system (subcontracting system) and have rickshaw pullers rent directly from rickshaw companies, the rickshaw companies can abide by the new regulations without difficulty, and the rickshaw pullers can also enjoy real benefits.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the current rickshaw craze should not have occurred. The reason why it has been brewing until now, and there is even a risk of a violent outbreak, may be that the two parties have not been able to meet with sincerity. It cannot be denied that the Municipal Council is too hasty in implementing the reform plan. As the Trade Association has stated, to abolish the "baotou" system, it is necessary to first improve the lives of rickshaw pullers and free them from the economic relationship with the "baotou." If this is not done and there is only talk of reducing rickshaw rental fees, it will not be possible to abolish the contracts between rickshaw owners and the "baotou," and rickshaw pullers may even have no rickshaws to pull, which is exactly what is expected.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for the sake of the livelihood of 140,000 common people and the order and stability of society, we sincerely hope that both parties will not go to extremes and will work together in a spirit of compromise to find a final solution.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Vienna is in a State of Panic; New Austrian Government Established <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Former Minister of Education Schuschnigg Appointed as Prime Minister</p>
<p>Starhemberg Retains Position as Deputy Prime Minister</p>
<p>Christian Heimwehr Faction Equally Divided in Key Positions</p>
<p>Vienna: The leader of the Heimwehr demanded that the position of Prime Minister must belong to their faction. President Miklas ignored his request and announced this morning that he had entrusted the task of forming a cabinet to Schuschnigg, the former Minister of Education. Prince Starhemberg, the commander-in-chief of the Heimwehr, will remain as Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently serve as Minister of Public Security, thus expanding his power compared to before.</p>
<p>Last night, the police received information that the Nazi Party was preparing for a second uprising. As a result, Vienna was again placed under martial law. A high-ranking police officer told an Associated Press reporter that the national police were prepared to mobilize to prevent the events of last week from recurring in Styria and other provinces.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Heimwehr in various regions held a meeting last night and decided to demand that key positions such as the Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Public Security be held by Heimwehr figures. It is also reported that Fessl, an important member of former Chancellor Dollfuss's cabinet, also supported this proposal. This resolution has been sent to Prince Starhemberg for submission to President Miklas. The Heimwehr's resolution also stated that they did not object to Schuschnigg serving as Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Outside, there was much speculation about this decision by Austria's powerful figures. Some said that the Heimwehr was brewing a coup and promoting Prince Starhemberg as dictator. Others said that the Nazi Party in Vienna had received secret orders to rise again. At a time when rumors were rife, the police were striving to respond. Machine guns were densely deployed at major intersections, and public offices and government buildings were heavily guarded. Vienna was in a state of panic. However, according to a high-ranking police officer who spoke to an Associated Press reporter, this preparedness was only to prevent any unexpected events after Dollfuss's funeral.</p>
<p>Many members of Dollfuss's government retained their positions in the new cabinet, with only slight adjustments. The power of the new Prime Minister, Schuschnigg, is not as great as that of the late Chancellor Dollfuss. However, he will concurrently serve as Minister of Defense, Education, and Justice, with General Zehner as Deputy Minister of Defense. Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg will concurrently serve as Minister of Public Security, a position previously held by Chancellor Dollfuss himself. Fessl, a former non-departmental cabinet member of the previous government, now serves as Minister of Interior. Waldner, the former Minister of Justice, has been transferred to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was also previously held by Dollfuss. The ministers of the other three departments remain unchanged: Stockinger as Minister of Commerce, Buresch as Minister of Finance, and Stummer as Minister of Public Welfare. The new Prime Minister, Schuschnigg, is generally recognized as a prominent monarchist with extensive experience in key positions and unparalleled political talent. He is also taciturn, resembling a university professor, and is a scholar of great learning, especially in political and economic studies. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Cabinet Members Well Allocated <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Vienna: Last night's cabinet meeting decided to appoint Dr. Schuschnigg, the 39-year-old Minister of Education and leader of the Farmers' League, as Prime Minister. Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Heimwehr, was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently heads the Ministry of Public Security. Therefore, Prince Starhemberg is responsible for commanding the Gendarmerie and the Auxiliary Army. The cabinet meeting lasted for eight hours before the organization of the new cabinet was finalized. Although the appointment of Dr. Schuschnigg as Prime Minister appears to be a victory for the Christian Social Party, the positions of Public Security, Foreign Affairs, and Interior are all led by Prince Starhemberg, representing the Heimwehr faction. Therefore, in reality, the victory belongs to the Heimwehr. The new Prime Minister is enthusiastic about religion and has a mild demeanor, which is not greatly resented by various opposition parties. Prince Starhemberg convened a cabinet meeting yesterday, requesting a reorganization of the cabinet to restore public confidence. Initially, it was thought that the meeting would result in Starhemberg taking power. People in the capital were deeply afraid that the Heimwehr would follow in the footsteps of the Nazi Party and cause turmoil. Therefore, the atmosphere was extremely tense, and all public offices were heavily guarded at the time. Now that the seats in the new cabinet have been properly allocated, public sentiment should gradually stabilize. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Vienna: After the establishment of the new "compromise cabinet," a new wave of turmoil has been avoided, and Vienna has temporarily become peaceful. Dr. Schuschnigg's appointment as Prime Minister is indeed a victory for Catholicism. However, the fact that the Heimwehr has obtained the four most important positions of Deputy Prime Minister, Public Security, Foreign Affairs, and Interior is also sufficient to be considered a victory for the Heimwehr. Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Heimwehr, relinquished the position of Prime Minister to Schuschnigg, which is generally seen as not necessarily permanent. Fessl's joining the cabinet is considered strange by many, as it is well known that the Christian Social Party opposes him. However, because the Heimwehr strongly supported Fessl, he was able to secure an important position in the new cabinet. Prince Starhemberg originally hoped for the position of Prime Minister, but President Miklas entrusted the task of forming a cabinet to Dr. Schuschnigg. Therefore, Starhemberg compromised and took the position of Deputy Prime Minister. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Vienna: Except for the ongoing confrontation between the Nazi Party and government forces near Salzburg, the Nazi rebellion throughout the country has been quelled. The city of Salzburg is particularly quiet. A special concert was held today to commemorate the late Chancellor, with a large number of attendees and no unexpected incidents. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Zagreb: 600 Austrian Nazi Party members who fled into Yugoslav territory have been detained in a refugee camp near here. It is said that 800 comrades are still holding out in the Austrian border mountains, hiding behind rocks and treetops, shooting at Austrian troops, determined to fight to the end. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Vienna: According to unconfirmed reports, some members of the Nazi Party attempted to secretly enter a hospital to rescue Rintelen, the former ambassador to Italy. A nurse noticed their suspicious behavior and informed the police by phone. As a result, those attempting the rescue were arrested and imprisoned. Train traffic between Germany and Austria has now resumed, but passengers are subject to strict questioning. Germans must have special passports. Apart from trains, border traffic remains completely closed. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

The special military court is composed of one judge and three military officers. The authorities have taken strict precautions to prevent interference by violent crowds during the trial. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Vienna: Pannetae, the Austrian National Socialist who broke into the Prime Minister's Office and committed the murder during the incident on the 24th, admitted today that he shot and killed Chancellor Dollfuss, but claimed that the motive for the murder was personal revenge. Pannetae admitted to joining the National Socialist Party and said that he had been discharged from the military by Dollfuss because of this, so he took the opportunity to vent his anger. He will be brought before a military court for trial. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Vienna: A mysterious suicide occurred here last night. A police officer named Dupla jumped from a window and fell to his death in the street. After investigation, it was learned that Dupla and ten other police officers had been assigned to guard the Prime Minister's Office on the day of the incident. Today was the scheduled date for the trial, but unexpectedly, he jumped from the window and committed suicide at the beginning of the trial. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Rome: Italian newspapers have published extremely激昂 anti-German remarks, saying that Germany is not only responsible for the death of Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss, but also has a conspiracy to subvert the Austrian government. They are determined to denounce Germany as a barbaric country, and say that Mussolini and Hitler previously gathered in Venice to discuss establishing the lowest level of common compromise in Europe. Only six weeks later, the two fascist countries are glaring at each other over the Austrian issue. Rumor has it that Prince Ottokar is in Belgium observing the people's assembly, waiting to return home to restore the Austrian monarchy. The prince is a fervent Catholic and is opposed to the Nazi Party. The Roman Curia values him highly. A few months ago, Mussolini could have welcomed the prince's restoration, but since the prince declared to the public that he demanded the return of South Tyrol, which was ceded to Italy based on the treaty, the Italian Prime Minister has stated that if the prince does not change his tune, he will not be able to obtain Italy's support. It is believed that the authorities in Yugoslavia would like to see Austria owned by the Nazi Party, and the Czech government is also opposed to the restoration of the Austrian monarchy. Although Italy and the two Slavic countries have all deployed troops to the border, the border remains quiet, but the crisis is latent. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian people cannot help but be suspicious of the appointment of German Deputy Chancellor Papen as ambassador to Austria. However, if the Italian government is concerned that Germany is interfering in Austria's internal affairs, will it also be in a position to be accused of interfering in Austrian affairs?</p>
<p>This is the question. It is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini wants to obtain the assistance of Britain and France to guarantee Austria's independence. Furthermore, Italy and Yugoslavia may also establish an understanding to deal with the events that may occur after Austria. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome: The four divisions of the Italian army sent to the Austrian border have now occupied the key mountain passes in the Alps: (1) the Brenner Pass, facing the Austrian city of Sterzing; (2) the Reschen Pass, facing the Austrian city of Nauders; (3) the San Candido Pass, facing the city of Silian; (4) the Tarvisio Pass, facing the Austrian city of Villach. The support troops and headquarters are located in Bolzano and Udine. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris): French newspapers have been quite pleased since the Vienna incident, as a rift has developed between Rome and Berlin. However, Italy's military actions have raised questions in some public opinion, especially among left-wing newspapers. They also support that the League of Nations should intervene in this matter. Former Foreign Minister Pongot wrote an article in the News today, saying that the joint action of France, Italy, and Britain is indispensable, but this is not enough, as the Austrian issue should be investigated in the League of Nations organization, so that representatives of all countries can participate in it, especially the Little Entente countries, because the Little Entente countries are more concerned about Austria's independence than other countries. Pongot also said that the future existence of Austria depends on the economic restructuring of the Danube River basin, and the economic restructuring of the Danube River basin can only be promoted by the alliance of the Danube countries. In addition, nationalist daily newspapers, in addition to acknowledging that Italy's surveillance after the Austrian incident has indeed removed the imminent danger, the situation of unilateral intervention has indeed been opened as a result. The socialist People's Daily said that there are many who maintain Austria's independence, but the danger of those who maintain it may not be less than the other danger that those who maintain Austria's independence want to remove.

<p>Vienna: Last night, the border between Austria and Bavaria was tightly sealed. Many travelers who tried to go to Germany from Austria were unable to cross the border. Rumors near the border said that Austrian soldiers in Germany had mutinied because their request to invade Austrian territory was not granted. After the mobilization of the national defense forces to suppress the mutiny, the rebellion did not expand. (Havas, 29th)</p>

In that year, Japan invested more in the construction and development of chemical manufacturing plants than in other industries, and the Soviet Union's economic plan also paid special attention to this industry. The Department of Commerce believes that the development of the chemical industry in the two countries deserves attention, because Japan's occupation of Manchuria has created a tense situation in the Far East, and both Japan and Russia clearly want to actively develop an independent chemical industry to be prepared for emergencies and no longer rely on foreign countries.

However, the delay in building 102 warships and the time required to implement the most advantageous naval plan will force the United States to participate in the 1935 naval conference as the third naval power. Britain and Japan have already reached the full extent allowed by the treaty, so they can attend the conference with confidence.

Subsequently, People's Committee Chairman Molotov hosted a banquet for Seljamaa, accompanied by government officials. Moscow Soviet Chairman Bulganin also entertained Seljamaa, accompanied by Litvinov and others.

<p>(Moscow): The following TASS communiqué has been released here: Estonian Foreign Minister Seljamaa, during his stay in Moscow, had several conversations with Litvinov. They discussed general issues of Soviet-Estonian relations, and expressed satisfaction with the progress of these relations and the increasing understanding and mutual trust between the two countries. When exchanging views on the international situation, they reached the following conclusion: that cooperation between the two countries in international events to consolidate peace in Eastern Europe, and their joint participation in international actions that could achieve the above-mentioned goals, would certainly produce results beneficial to the interests of both countries. They also agreed that, since both the Soviet Union and Estonia are willing to preserve stable peace, it is necessary to continue efforts to strive for peace in the current European political situation, and that it is also necessary to adopt a supportive attitude towards new problems and new proposals for stable peace that arise in this context. Based on the above points, the Estonian Foreign Minister made the following statement to Litvinov: "The Estonian government declares its supportive attitude towards the spirit of the Eastern Mutual Assistance Pact to be signed by the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and the Baltic countries. However, since Estonia does not have the original text of the pact, it must reserve the right to make necessary additions when it receives the plan."</p>

<h3 id="e32">German Interior Minister on Hitler's Policies <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, July 23) Since Hitler came to power in Germany, he has been actively rectifying internal affairs. To understand the details, this reporter went to the German Ministry of the Interior to meet with Minister Frick and inquire about Hitler's future major policies. The answers were as follows:</p>
<p>In November 1918, the German army was forced to return home by the Red Party. On the march, they were made to salute the red flags carried by the Marxist thugs. However, the achievements of the soldiers who sacrificed themselves in four and a half years of bloody battles were all in vain. Furthermore, the ideals of the German soldiers to resist oppression were almost completely wiped out. The hardworking masses were once again sacrificed for the ideals of overseas opposition scholars. Millions of German soldiers died for the benefit of insignificant people, and no one cared. This was already obvious. One of the German soldiers, Mr. Hitler, could not ignore this point. He proved that the children of the nation should have a kind of latent heroic spirit. In 1914, he already had patriotic enthusiasm, equal to the enthusiasm to resist to the end. Later, the war ended and a treaty was signed, causing the German people to lose their freedom for generations. Because of this, the people with national ideas were greatly disappointed. In the dark period of German history, Mr. Hitler felt that he should pay attention to domestic society. Recalling the world war and its final collapse, he began to build the fundamental foundation.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler's fundamental difference from those opposing the republican government is that he not only opposed the republican government, but also deeply understood that there was a winning system. For the war soldiers, he imagined the glory of the past and, for the sake of lost happiness, Mr. Hitler had no scruples. However, he hated the plan to restore the old situation. Mr. Hitler already knew what the rent in the country was like before the war. Since the war, the rent has increased day by day. At that time, the sovereign of the political system had no rescue plan. Later, the war suddenly collapsed, and he immediately succumbed to the Red Party, which was enough to show the weakness of the political internal affairs department. In fact, they lost the hearts of the people when they led the army to the extreme.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler knew that the source of failure should be eradicated fundamentally, and that the shortcomings of the middle-class German world philosophy should be transcended. In 1918, a movement occurred. This movement had already sprouted several years before the war. Since the empire in 1871, the speed of economic growth has been increasing. Due to the changes in the theory of equal division of land rights, it has become obvious that the country is the most industry-based in the universe. This sudden change has been indifferent to the middle class, and as a result, the tendency of pragmatism has emerged. It has not yet worn the mask of advocating free thought, but there are other skeptics, manipulators, and utilizers of liberalism, who are superficially compliant and deliberately destroy the democratic system. The middle class has gained verbal benefits, but does not know for sure what it should get. In 1918, the middle class supported the Red Party. The people of Germany knew that they would only be reactionary in the end and had no power to restore the empire. There was also a majority of the people who claimed to represent the people with property, but they were as different as horses and cows. Mr. Hitler wanted to be jointly responsible with them, but Mr. Hitler knew their desires and pain, and felt that they were treated as second- and third-class citizens. The world's property was used as a strategy for various prices. The pain of the middle class and their hypocrisy were extremely evil. German workers were driven by internal dissatisfaction and were never anesthetized by Marxism. They knew that the theory of pragmatism was rough and easy to understand, and that the external search for the enemies of capitalism had been realized externally. The national concept and national unity were invisibly eliminated and destroyed by traitors. The middle class's belief in internationalism was born from this. No country in the world believes in Marxism as much as Germany, and no other country's opposition has gained such a large volume. After Mr. Hitler incited, he had his own experience. Later, those who were jealous tried their best to advocate selfish ambition. Mr. Hitler had to abandon his work, but no one was enthusiastic about this kind of contempt for national prosperity. In the face of the enemy, he had no courage to work for socialism. From this, it can be seen that four and a half years of hard fighting were in vain, and infinite rebellion was produced in the country, that is, the collapse of the people, which was actually due to this. Moreover, the destruction of the imperial flag in the world may not be due to this. The German working class, in the eyes of millions of martyrs, seemed to be responsible, while the frontline soldiers were merely holders of various occupations who died in vain. Mr. Hitler was confident that he should have a two-pronged approach. He should revive the people with national ideas, and then the country could regain its work. No matter what kind of German, he should be as patriotic as Mr. Hitler. In the situation of party struggle, Mr. Hitler pioneered National Socialism to save the Germans living in the world. It was the beginning of the struggling commemorative day. At that time, there were combatants in the European War who were corporals and responded to Mr. Hitler. Another comrade was good at administrative affairs and was invited to advocate the doctrine created by Mr. Hitler. Even in the dark period, the concept of saving Germany stood firm and was able to come up with a wonderful plan to gather new atmosphere. The morale of the people has been increasing day by day.

<p>(Paris) The German newspaper "Paris Daily" published here stated that the relationship between German President Hindenburg and Chancellor Hitler is still extremely tense. Two regiments of the National Defense Force are currently stationed near Neudeck and are in a state of alert. Their only task is to ensure the freedom of President's personal actions. As for Prussian Prime Minister Goering, he recently seemed to propose to President Hindenburg to protect the President with his guards. The President refused, saying that the National Defense Force could be responsible for the protection. If Goering's guards marched to Neudeck, their weapons would be disarmed. At that time, anyone who dared to resist would be regarded as a traitor and arrested according to law. Seeing that the President's attitude was so firm, Goering cancelled the previous proposal.

<p>The United States Expresses Non-Interference</p>
<p>Manila Two hundred representatives met in the House of Representatives here today to draft a constitution for the Philippine Republic based on the Philippine Independence Act. The form of the constitution is a republic, so the Philippines and China will be sister republics in the Far East. And those who follow the US Congress will take the Philippines as the beginning. The constitutional convention opened at 10:00 this morning and was convened by Senate President Quezon. Quezon is the leader of the Philippine independence movement and is said to be the first president of the Philippine Republic. However, Quezon is not a representative of the constitutional convention. It was hoped that Governor-General Murphy would attend the meeting and give a speech, but this did not happen. It is said that this is an expression of the United States' unwillingness to interfere in the constitutional convention. The representatives talked loudly in the conference hall until Speaker Quezon arrived at the hospital to stop it. Quezon delivered a short speech, congratulating the constitutional convention on its greatest success. (National News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>(Taiyuan) Grain prices in various parts of Shanxi Province have soared in recent days, generally by more than one-third.

Furthermore, there is a situation of "a market exists without goods," causing widespread panic. The provincial government is planning relief measures and intends to prohibit grain exports.

<p>Report by the Soviet Union's Karakhan</p>
<p>July 25, Tokyo Asahi Shimbun special dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Karakhan recently published an article on Mongolia, stating, "The number of Japanese military personnel inspecting and traveling in Inner Mongolia is increasing daily. Russia should pay close attention to Japan's invasion of Outer Mongolia. To ensure the security of 'Manchukuo,' Japan intends to annex Inner Mongolia. Judging from the recent situation in Inner Mongolia, the people of Inner Mongolia harbor displeasure towards Japan. Japan will forcibly annex Inner Mongolia to fulfill its ambition." It is believed that Karakhan's visit to Kulun is of profound significance, as many of Karakhan's entourage are senior army officers. He will take this opportunity to secretly plan military cooperation between Russia and Mongolia to resist Japan's advance.</p>

<p>Huang, Tang, and Yin in Secret Discussions at Huang's Residence</p>
<p>Huang's Return North Is Undecided</p>
<p>Moganshan correspondence: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, again carrying the order of Director Wang, came to Moganshan to urge Huang Fu to leave the mountain as soon as possible and preside over the overall situation in North China. Tang took a small chartered car from Shanghai at 5:00 AM on the 29th, passing through Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and arrived at Yucun Station at 11:00 AM. He changed to a sedan chair and climbed the mountain, resting in room 103 of the Railway Hotel. After a light meal, he went to Huang Fu's private residence at number 509 to meet with him, conveying Wang's request for Huang's return to the north and discussing various major diplomatic strategies towards Japan in North China. Yin Tong also arrived at Huang's residence before 10:00 AM. The three of them discussed and studied the North China issue in a secret room until 11:00 PM late at night, when Tang and Yin returned to their residences. The reporter visited Tang at dawn and was told, "After I, representing Director Wang, urged Chairman Huang again, he stated that he would of course continue to be responsible for the overall situation in North China. However, it is still the height of summer, and the situation in North China does not seem to require an immediate return to the north. He plans to postpone the trip for a while and set a date later. He may need to go to Lushan at the beginning of next month. Regarding the establishment of checkpoints and tax collection at Gubeikou, the Japanese side intends to request a special permit to be refunded when passing through the checkpoints after paying taxes, but it has not yet been proposed. The rampant banditry in the war zone is actually caused by collusion with unscrupulous officials, and the people are suffering extremely. The newly formed security team may be able to make up for it in the event of security. The tomb of Prince Chun in Tongzhou being robbed and destroyed has a significant impact on the future of diplomacy. The various issues in the war zone are being prepared for takeover. The bombing case in Tudian has been handled well, and the dead and wounded have been compensated. Yue Kaixian, the diplomatic commissioner of Chahar Province, will leave Beijing to take office in Chahar. If no accidents occur, diplomacy in North China can proceed smoothly, otherwise it is unpredictable. I will return to Shanghai and then go to Beijing to report the urging process to Director Wang. The trip to Lushan needs to be decided temporarily." The reporter also visited Yin Tong, who said, "Chairman Huang will be able to go north in the short term. The trip to Lushan is based on a telegram from Chairman Chiang, and he will return north along the way in the future. Now that the war zone issue can be gradually resolved, it will be necessary to focus on rescuing the rural economy. In addition to the 5 million yuan of war zone bonds issued last year to handle relief work, which is the same as the bankrupt rural areas in the south, there are still more than 1 million yuan of loans to be used as a cooperative fund for rural areas. There are a total of five provinces and two cities in North China, with 1,500 cooperatives. It is planned to borrow huge sums of money from the banking industry to promote expansion, and it is also planned to improve primary politics, train talents, and improve the lives of the people in the war zone. The Japanese army has not withdrawn from Gubeikou Jianchangying and other four locations. The Chahar Eastern Incident is being studied for resolution. There is no truth to the claim that the Japanese side is investing in the Changcheng Shmenzhai Coal Mine. The report is likely inaccurate. After Minister Gu of the Railway Department returns to Beijing, I will meet with him and visit Director Wang and Zhang, and then return to Peiping to resume my duties." (July 30)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Equal Treatment for Chinese and Foreign Nationals <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Nationals Do Not Pay Taxes</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Burdens Increase Even More</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: The Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce held a meeting on the 26th, chaired by Hong Hongru, to discuss ways to rescue the declining Xiamen economy. It is often said that there are many kinds of donations and taxes in the city's commerce, and the burden on merchants is very heavy. However, foreign-owned shops mostly refuse to pay various donations and taxes. In fact, there are many Japanese and Taiwanese nationals in Xiamen, occupying an important position in the commercial field. Since foreign nationals can be tax-exempt, their burden is naturally lighter. The Donations and Taxes Bureau cannot obtain the tax from foreign nationals, so it seeks to compensate from domestic merchants, thus the burden on domestic merchants is increasing. They cannot compete with foreign nationals, and more and more people are trying to avoid taxes by becoming foreign nationals. Therefore, it was decided, "The association should petition the provincial government and the Department of Finance to ensure equal treatment for Chinese and foreign taxpayers." At the same time, since Xiamen already pays land rent, shop tax, and a police donation based on the standard of the shop tax, which are all considered land taxes, it was decided to request "the consolidation of land tax collection." The Chamber of Commerce's document to the Provincial Government and the Department of Finance is recorded below,</p>
<p>"Petition for a petition. Xiamen is a commercial port, the hub of southern Fujian, and the economic center of the province. The prosperity or decline of the area is closely related to the future of Fujian Province, and it is extremely important. In recent years, it has been affected by the depression in Southeast Asia, and domestic areas have suffered repeated accidents. Rural areas in southern Fujian have gone bankrupt, and the burden of excessive taxes and levies is too heavy for the people to bear, resulting in a decline in commerce and financial depletion. If we do not try to rescue it quickly, the future will be disastrous. I would like to present my humble opinion as follows: A. Chinese and foreign treatment should be equal. In Xiamen, where Chinese and foreigners live together, foreign nationals use their foreign nationality as a shield to resist the payment of various donations and taxes (such as shop tax, land rent, police donation, deed tax, business tax, etc.). Government tax revenue cannot be reduced, and those who are lost to foreign nationals are taken from Chinese nationals. The burden on Chinese merchants is becoming heavier, and it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain, and bankruptcies are frequent, while merchants of foreign nationality are tax-free and bear a lighter burden. More and more people are joining foreign nationality. If this continues, in a few years, Xiamen, although not a continuation of the Northeast, will no longer belong to us. Thinking of this makes me shiver. This is the first. B. Land tax should be collected in a consolidated manner. In Xiamen, land rent is collected for business buildings, and shop tax is also collected. The public security police donation is collected monthly according to the standard of the shop rent. All three of these are land taxes, but different agencies are established, wasting public funds, building houses on top of houses, and collecting taxes repeatedly. This not only violates the central government's principle of a unified tax system, but also violates the meaning of your excellency's efforts to relieve the people's pain by reducing and abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. This is the second. C. Business tax should be collected in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry. Since the abolition of the Likin tax in Xiamen, business tax has been implemented. Tax authorities do not comply with the regulations of the Ministry. For example, the business tax on seafood is a disguised form of fishing tax, and the business tax on fruit is a disguised form of fruit donation. The business tax on fir wood and red material is a disguised form of fir wood and red material donation. These taxes have either been abolished by the central government or have a tax rate of no more than two per thousand. The fishing tax has been abolished by the central government. The business tax rate for the fruit, fir wood, and red material industries is set at two per thousand by the Ministry. However, the tax authorities contract it out to others, and the tax rate is more than fifty per thousand. Other business taxes are not collected in accordance with the tax rates set by the Ministry, and the Business Tax Assessment Committee is not established in accordance with the law (this association once sent a letter to the Tax Bureau to establish a Business Tax Assessment Committee, but the Tax Bureau ignored it). How can the people bear such outrageous levies? This is the third. The above are all matters of great importance to the future of the local and national government. What the heart feels is dangerous, and it is difficult to be silent. For this reason, it is appropriate to submit a document petitioning your excellency to quickly plan a rescue measure and to request investigation and implementation. The local government is fortunate, and the country is fortunate. Respectfully submitted to Chen, the Governor of Fujian Province, and Xu, the Director of the Department of Finance of Fujian Province, and Hong Hongru, the Chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce.

<h3 id="e90">Many Dangerous Works on the Grand Canal in Shandong Province <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Tuhai River Overflowed and Breached</p>
<p>The Duke Zhou River Is Also in Danger</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: Shandong Province has been experiencing cloudy and rainy days for days, and the water level of various rivers has risen sharply, creating dangerous situations. The Yellow River and the Northern Grand Canal have risen the most violently. The Yellow River rose sharply yesterday. Although the water level has dropped slightly today (28th), the current is still turbulent, and the work situation is still quite tense. The Wanfu, Zhushui, Yun, and Si rivers in southern Shandong have also increased, but fortunately, no major accidents have occurred. The Northern Grand Canal rose nine feet sharply the other day, and rose another four meters yesterday. The water overflowed, and dangerous works emerged one after another. The provincial highway bridge of the Grand Canal at the Dongguan Dasi in Liaocheng was washed away by the flood at night, flowing north and cutting off transportation. The embankment on the east bank of the Grand Canal was eroded by water and was about to overflow and breach. Laborers are desperately rushing to protect it. The water in the Yanggu Shouzhang Grand Canal rose four meters, a total of twelve Chinese feet. Acheng Town and the Twelve Lianwa overflowed and were about to breach. The Tuhai River overflowed due to the backflow of the Grand Canal. The Duke Zhou River also had dangerous works. The county heads and the fourth section chiefs of the counties along the coast are supervising the laborers to plant willows and block the river, rushing to protect it day and night. The Department of Construction received warning telegrams from all parties today (28th), as if snowflakes were flying. In addition to reporting to the provincial government, they have strictly ordered river workers in various parts of the Northern Grand Canal to actively rush to protect it, hoping to ensure safety. The water level of the Yellow River and the telegrams received by the Department of Construction are recorded below,</p>
<h3 id="e91">Yellow River Water Level <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong Province has dropped slightly today (28th). The water level at Lishengtun in the upper reaches is 57.17 meters.

<h3 id="e92">River Warning <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Construction received warning telegrams, (1) The Liaocheng project was completed and accepted on the 26th. The current of the river is turbulent. The water head from Yanggu and Shouzhang is more than three meters high. The Tuhai River is full. The north and south banks of Sitouhe and the north and south banks of Wang Guangyu Bridge have all overflowed and are in danger. Fortunately, the fourth section chief gathered the crowd to plant willows, temporarily ensuring safety. If the water rises again, it will be difficult to ensure the safety of the Grand Canal itself. Inspector Zhao Xuntai and Xue Guangzhen thank you. (2) The canal water continues to rise, and dangerous conditions are emerging. Behind the Dongguan Dasi is the provincial highway over the Grand Canal. The entire bridge at that location collapsed at night. The bridge wood drifted north. After chasing it for a mile, we finally caught it. The embankment east of the bridge is thin and will roll to the east. We are rushing to protect it. The confluence of the canal and the Tuhai River and the confluence of the canal and the Zhou Gong River are very critical. We are rushing to block them. Liaocheng County has a construction inspector, Yan Dengyou. (3) The water from the upstream Yanggu and Shouzhang of the canal is quite large. The water in Acheng Town and the Twelve Lianwa is very large, and the river water has risen to four meters, overflowing and collapsing. It is worthy of worry. Please send someone to investigate the truth in order to release the water and avoid danger. Liaocheng County has a construction inspector, Yan Dengyou. (4) The following is a report on the continued rise of the canal water: 1. The canal water has risen to more than three meters. We have led the laborers to guard the embankment, and it seems that there is nothing to worry about. 2. The Tuhai River and the canal water have backed up, and the water is full. It has collapsed on the south bank of Wang Guangyu Bridge. We have now led the laborers to complete the blockade and are guarding the river day and night on both sides. 3. The Zhou Gong River and the canal water have risen, and the water is even greater. The north and south banks are being replenished by the laborers. First, I will send this telegram, and then I will continue to report. Liaocheng County has a construction inspector, Yan Dengyou. (28th)</p>

<p>Bandits in Western Fujian Defeated and Fled Back to Ruijin</p>
<p>Shantou correspondence: When Chen Zhang's brigade of the Southern Route Army was stationed in Shanghang and Yongding in southern Fujian, Zhou Lixing's regiment, a remnant of the 19th Route Army, asked Chen to recruit them. Chen immediately telegraphed the headquarters for instructions. Chen's brigade has now moved to Luotang in Xunwu, and Zhou's unit has been recruited by Huang Renhuan's division. They are now concentrated in Yongding awaiting reorganization. The bandits in Changting have broken through several times, but were defeated. On the 20th, the pseudo-24th Division attacked Dayangba in Shanghang, but was repelled by the Shi Division. According to intelligence, the main force of the Red bandits Zhu De was between Changting, Gucheng, Shicheng, Ninghua, Guihua, and Qingliu. The Central Army immediately advanced towards Ninghua. On the 20th and 21st, they fought a major battle with the bandits' garrison division, the Young Pioneers, and guerrillas, totaling about 5,000 people, for two days and nights. On the morning of the 22nd, the bandits collapsed. Peng Dehuai's bandits abandoned Ninghua and retreated to Changting. Luo Binghui's bandits, who harassed Jianyang, also retreated to Jinxi and Lichuan. It is also heard that no less than 30,000 bandits have retreated to Ruijin, Yudu, and Huichang. In western Fujian, only a few thousand guerrillas were left to contain the Eastern Route Army. After the bandits' main force moved to southern Jiangxi, a large number of bandits suddenly appeared on the north bank of the Zhang River in Xinfeng. Ships and rafts gathered on the upstream of the north bank. The Southern Route Army feared that the bandits would cross the river and attack, and the front line was on high alert. It is heard that Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Red Russian advisors have returned to the Ruijin Nankeng Command from western Fujian. It is also heard that the Northern, Eastern, and Central Route Bandit Suppression Armies are pressing hard on the bandits' backs. A major battle is expected to take place in southern Jiangxi soon.

Recently, the Gannan Political Affairs Commissioner's Office organized an investigation team to inspect various counties in Gannan to carry out investigation work in order to promote reforms. The results of the investigation show that during the bandit suppression period, general administration was not on track, and there were many excessive and miscellaneous taxes and levies in various counties, and the burden on the people was heavy. The office specifically scheduled a meeting of responsible representatives from various counties on the 15th of next month to discuss the abolition of excessive and petty miscellaneous donations and to prepare methods to compensate for the loss. After investigation, the land tax of each county will also be sorted out.</p>

<p>Beijing News: Overseas Chinese are scattered in various ports overseas, and there has always been a lack of detailed investigation and accurate statistics. Now, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that in the midst of rescuing overseas Chinese citizens, it is necessary to have an accurate investigation and statistics on the distribution and number of overseas Chinese. Therefore, it specifically investigated various overseas Chinese organizations and based its findings on reports from embassies and consulates in various locations. The statistics have now been completed, totaling 7,838,895 people. The regions and numbers of overseas residents are recorded as follows: United States 74,954 people, Canada 42,100 people, Mexico 25,000 people, Peru 5,704 people, Chile 2,700 people, Brazil 820 people, Argentina 600 people, Colombia 1,000 people, Venezuela 2,826 people, Central American countries 94,000 people, West Indies 36,400 people, Germany 1,800 people, France 17,000 people, United Kingdom 8,000 people, Portuguese Timor in Southeast Asia 3,500 people, Dutch East Indies in Southeast Asia 1,232,650 people, British North Borneo in Southeast Asia 75,000 people, British Malaya Archipelago in Southeast Asia 1,709,392 people, Siam 2,500,000 people, India 15,000 people, Vietnam 381,417 people, Burma 193,598 people, Korea 41,303 people, Taiwan 46,691 people, Japan 20,074 people, South Africa 4,500 people, New Zealand 2,854 people, Australia 15,500 people, Indian Ocean Islands 5,000 people, Philippine Islands 110,500 people, Pacific Islands 1,200 people, Hawaiian Islands 27,179 people, Lithuania 7 people, Finland 7 people, Soviet Russia 251,500 people, Denmark 900 people, Norway 3 people, Sweden 23 people, Turkey 7,000 people, Yugoslavia 37 people, Bulgaria 7 people, Romania 4 people, Switzerland 149 people, Italy 274 people, Hungary 49 people, Austria 98 people, Czechoslovakia 250 people, Poland 139 people, Belgium 550 people, Netherlands 8,000 people, Portugal 1,200 people, Spain 90 people, Luxembourg 52 people, Latvia 2 people, Estonia 3 people, Tahiti 5,000 people, Georgia 2,300 people, Fiji 75 people, Hong Kong 825,645 people, Macau 119,875 people, total 7,838,895 people.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Locust Control Methods Formulated by the Agricultural Experiment Station <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Divided into three steps: controlling locust eggs, controlling nymphs, and controlling adult locusts</p>
<p>Beijing News: In order to eliminate locust plagues in various provinces, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station convened a locust control meeting in early June involving seven provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Hunan, resolving various locust control measures. In order to study the distribution of locusts throughout the country, the conditions of the plagues, and prevention methods, the station specifically invited Professor Zou Zhonglin of the National Central University's College of Agriculture to be a special locust control researcher. Last week, Zou went to Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces to investigate and research. At the same time, Ren Mingdao, a technician from the Department of Plant Pathology and Entomology of the station, and Qian Shenghao, a locust investigator, were sent to Anhui and Jiangsu provinces to investigate the locust plague conditions. It is now understood that the station has formulated methods for locust control and prevention, which are recorded below for the reference of those concerned with agricultural affairs.</p>
<p>Locust Egg Control Method: (1) Plowing Method: Locust eggs are laid underground at a depth of about one or two inches. They are protected by the surrounding soil and can often safely overwinter and hatch. If we remove the soil around the locust eggs, they will easily be injured and lose their vitality. Therefore, when locust eggs are found in wasteland, we can use plows to deeply till the soil and turn the egg masses to the surface. At this time, the egg masses will either dry out due to exposure to the sun, freeze to death due to ice and snow, or be seen and eaten by various birds. In addition, a portion of the egg masses will be directly destroyed by the plow and die. If locusts lay eggs on riverbanks, dikes, roadsides, etc., where plowing is not possible, hoes can be used instead of plows to turn up the soil and break up the clods, exposing the locust eggs to the air, where they will die from external climate changes and natural enemies. In areas where summer locusts lay eggs, plowing should be done quickly. If the opportunity is missed, they will easily hatch into autumn nymphs and eat our seedlings. At this time, because the weather is extremely hot, the egg masses will easily be dried out by the sun after being plowed up. (2) Egg Digging Method: In areas where locusts lay eggs, patrol for areas where the soil surface is slightly raised or full of small holes. Use a hoe or egg digger to dig up the egg masses, trying to destroy their structure so that they cannot hatch, or feed them to chickens and ducks. In addition, a "tail插" (a tool with a wooden handle and an iron head) can be used to select areas with locust eggs, insert it into the soil, and destroy the locust eggs, or a bamboo pole about one foot long and about one inch in diameter can be used, with the lower two inches or so cut diagonally into a sloping surface with a slightly pointed end. When using it, insert the pointed end of the bamboo pole next to the small hole, then turn the bamboo pole and lift it upwards to dig out the egg mass. Locust Nymph Control Method: (1) Ditch Digging Method: Digging ditches to control locust nymphs is a very effective method. When locust nymphs migrate, they move forward in swarms. We can dig ditches in front of the nymphs to block them. The length of the ditch is not fixed and can be determined based on the area covered by the nymphs. The width of the ditch should be determined based on the instar of the nymphs, because the jumping ability of nymphs of different instars is different. The larger the nymph instar, the stronger the jumping ability. The width of the ditch surface should be more than three 日餘 inches, and the depth should be about three to four feet. In this way, the two walls of the ditch will be inwardly inclined. The soil dug from the ditch should be piled in front of the migrating nymphs to prevent them from jumping over the ditch and falling into it. The ditch walls should be smooth so that the nymphs cannot crawl out after falling in. Deep pits should be dug in the ditch every five or six feet. Locust nymphs will naturally fall into the pits after jumping into the ditch. After the ditch is dug, locust control personnel should line up and surround the locust nymphs, driving them into the ditch. Then, use baskets or nets to scoop them out and bury them in pits to prevent rot. They can also be used as fertilizer in the future. (2) Encirclement and Beating Method: If locust nymphs appear in plains, wastelands, or thatch fields, they can be wiped out using the encirclement and beating method. When encircling and beating, first erect a flag in the center of the nymph area. The people beating the nymphs should each prepare a broom (made of bamboo tips or willow branches) or a specially made locust-beating broom. They should all go to the locust area and surround the nymph swarm in the middle, forming a circle. Then, use the brooms to drive the nymph swarm towards the central flag. Slowly shrink the encirclement. After the nymph swarm gathers in one place, everyone should use their brooms to beat them to death as much as possible. Or, before encircling and beating, dig a deep pit in the center of the nymph area (the depth and diameter of the pit should be able to accommodate the local nymph swarm). Then, take several reed mats, each clamped with bamboo so that they can be held with both hands. The people beating the nymphs should each hold a reed mat, surround the nymph swarm, and gradually drive them towards the center, causing the nymphs to fall into the pit. Alternatively, use stack folds used for storing grain instead of reed mats, which is also very convenient. When using them, two people should each hold one end of the stack fold and gradually shrink towards the center, forcing the nymphs to jump into the pit. After the pit is full, cover it with soil and bury it. Then change to another location and proceed in the same way. (3) Duck Pecking Method: Using ducks to peck locust nymphs is very effective. According to our previous experience, each large duck can eat two catties of locust nymphs in a day. If a thousand ducks are used to eat nymphs, they can eat two thousand catties in a day. For example, last year in the Hugel Lake area of Wujin, Jiangsu, a large number of autumn nymphs appeared and were very rampant. Duck were released along the lake to peck at them (tens of thousands of immature ducks sucked them up every day, and could eliminate about fifty "dan" of nymph swarms). After seven or eight days, the nymph swarms along the lake were all sucked up. The effectiveness of the duck pecking method is certainly great, but ducks often die easily from overeating. This should be noted. For example, this year in Longtan, Jiangning County, Jiangsu, ducks were used to peck nymphs, but because they ate too much, four or five hundred of the more than 40,000 ducks died from bloating. Therefore, when using the duck pecking method, several points should be noted in advance: First, there should be water nearby. Second, the ducks should not be fed too full. Third, the ducks should be driven into the water to swim and drink water every half hour. Fourth, give the ducks a rest. In this way, the ducks will easily digest after eating the nymphs and will not die. (4) Oil Killing Method: Petroleum oil (i.e., kerosene used for ordinary lighting) is very effective in killing locusts. If locust nymphs appear by a river or lake, we can first spray a thin layer of oil on the water surface, and then drive the nymphs into the river, causing the nymph bodies to suffocate and die from contact with the oil. When applying this method, if the river water is flowing, bamboo poles or straw piles should first be used to block the ends of the river to prevent the oil from dispersing. Also, when using the ditch digging method, fill the ditch with water and sprinkle a little petroleum oil on the water surface. Locust nymphs will die immediately after falling into the ditch and coming into contact with the oil. This method is much more effective than simply digging a ditch without filling it with water. This method should be used in places near water. (5) Net Scooping Method: When locust nymphs appear near rivers, it is common to see nymph swarms crossing the river. At this time, bamboo poles or straw piles can be used to block the nymphs around the periphery, driving them to the side near the riverbank. Because locust nymphs cannot jump in the water, we can use bamboo sieves or iron wire nets to scoop them up in the water. After scooping them out, bury them in pits. Sometimes, when locust nymphs appear on the riverbank, they can also be driven into the river by humans, and then scooped up. (6) Poison Bait Method: In places where locust nymphs have little food, poison bait can be scattered for them to eat. After they eat it, they will be poisoned and die. To make poison bait, use 30 parts of wheat bran, one part each of white arsenic (which can be replaced by domestically produced arsenic, priced at about four 角 per catty) and maltose. First, dissolve the sugar in water, then mix the wheat bran and arsenic together, pour in the sugar water, and stir evenly. Then, add clean water (about 25 parts) to moisten the wheat bran until it is like bean curd residue. If some spices (such as orange juice, lemon juice) can be added to the wheat bran, it will be even better, as this will easily make the aroma spread and attract the nymphs to eat. The spreading period should be in the morning and evening, otherwise it will easily dry out and lose its effectiveness. The amount of poison bait to use depends on the number of nymphs. About three catties per mu. The price of wheat bran is about three 分 of silver per catty, white arsenic is about seven 角 five 分 per catty, and maltose is about five 分 per catty. If 30 catties of wheat bran, one catty each of white arsenic and maltose are used to make poison bait, it will cost about one 元 seven 角 of silver, which can be used to spread over an area of seven mu, costing only two 角 four 分 of silver per mu, which is still economical. To spread the poison bait, knead the wheat bran into the shape of 餅 with your hands, and spread one 餅 every certain distance in the locust area (one 餅 should be spread within every two square feet in densely populated areas, and one 餅 should be spread within every five square feet in sparsely populated areas). However, it must be noted that the bait is poisonous, and livestock and poultry should be prohibited from entering the area. (7) Bag Collection Method: When locust nymphs appear in rice paddies and other methods cannot be used for control, locust-catching bags can be used to sweep and kill them. This method can also be used when adult locusts rest on plants in the evening and early morning and cannot fly.</p>
<p>Adult Locust Control Method: (1) Capture Method: Adult locusts have very strong flying ability and are not easy to control. However, when it rains, or when the temperature drops from evening to morning and dew falls, the wings of adult locusts are covered with rainwater or dew and they cannot fly, making them easiest to capture. Adult locusts mostly land in reeds, sorghum, and weeds. We can capture them when they land. The capture must gather a large group of people, carrying bamboo baskets, hemp bags, and other items, and proceed at the same time. The captured locusts should be pinched to death at any time and placed in baskets or bags. After the baskets or bags are full, bury them in pits to prevent rot. If there is no time to capture them during the day, lanterns can be lit at night and captured according to the above method. If everyone can work hard to do this, the results will definitely be great. Last year, Wujin County, Jiangsu, used money to buy adult locusts. Two brothers claimed to have captured more than 200 catties of adult locusts in the reeds in the middle of the night. This is a good example.</p>

<p>The Director of the Field Tax Office is Accused of Corruption</p>
<p>Zhu Xiyun, the director of the Wuxian County Field Tax Collection Office, was accused by someone to the county government last month, listing facts and alleging that he had engaged in embezzlement and corruption, embezzling more than 100,000 from the national treasury. The county government ignored this matter. Now, Gu Zhixin, Zhang Shiyi, and others have accused Zhu to the provincial government in the name of citizens, listing seven facts and requesting that officials be sent to Suzhou to supervise the local party and government agencies to investigate in detail and severely punish him. It is also said that Chen Lisui, a former employee of the Field Tax Office, colluded with Zhu in corruption. Later, because the share of the loot was too small, he reported the secret to the former provincial government. Because an official of the provincial government was familiar with Zhu, he notified Zhu, and Zhu dismissed Chen and introduced him to a branch of the Field Rent Office. At the same time, he tried to eliminate the case invisibly.</p>

<p>Gu Jingting, a doctor in Jiaozhi Town, seduced Yin Shuzhen, a 20-year-old girl who lived in his home, into having sex last year. This spring, Shuzhen gave birth to a son. Gu suddenly abandoned her and married a woman named Wang in Kunshan this summer. Yin Shuzhen then sued the court. The prosecutor's office investigated and prosecuted the criminal court for obstructing morals and family. After repeated trials, Gu categorically denied the seduction and rape. Shuzhen recounted the circumstances of the rape in court and presented a birthmark on Gu's lower body as evidence. The verdict was announced on the 30th. Gu Jingting was sentenced to three years in prison. After hearing the verdict, Gu stated in court that he would not accept it and would appeal.</p>

<p>Li Wencai, a villager in Dongshandushuibqiao Village, 44 years old, lived with his wife, Yao, 30 years old, his eldest son, Jinmin, 7 years old, and his second son, Jinlin, 3 years old. The family of four ran the Lidechang Opium Den. At 12 o'clock the night before, Li and his wife were sleeping upstairs when a fire suddenly broke out in the shop downstairs. When they woke up in a dream, the fire was already raging and burning to the bed. Although they shouted for help, no one dared to go upstairs to rescue them because the ladder had also been burned. Li and his wife hugged their youngest son, Jinlin, and jumped into the river from the back building. Fortunately, the water was shallow and they were not drowned, but the clothes on their bodies, hands, feet, and faces were all burned. They were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Both the husband and wife died of heart attack from the fire toxins shortly after. Their eldest son, Jin Guan, did not escape and was buried in the fire. Only the youngest son, Jinlin, had lighter injuries. On the 30th, the bailiff came to the city to report to the court for an inspection.</p>

<p>The weather is dry, the river water is shallow and dries up, and there are problems with drinking water in the urban area. The river banks in the rural areas can be seen to the bottom, and farmland irrigation is impossible. Seedlings wither and are difficult to save. The villagers are anxious and cannot sleep or eat. They have all stopped killing and are praying for rain to show their solemnity. On the 27th of this month, residents of Nancangmen outside Guangfu Gate, such as Guo Rongting, initiated a joint prayer for rain, hiring more than a dozen Taoist priests to set up an altar and perform rituals in the Ning Shao Fellow Association. They also erected a high wooden platform on the field, with five paper dragons in green, yellow, red, white, and black, and a red-faced paper figure behind, with the words "Dongyuan Palace" and "Expel Plague and Drive Away Epidemics" written on it. They offered incense and cases. Two Taoist priests were chanting scriptures there. In addition, there were more than 200 Buddhist women chanting Buddhist scriptures in unison, limited to five days. Every day, the old masters held Chao boards and kowtowed to the five dragons, expressing their desire for the heavens to draw water. Although their actions are foolish, their will is sincere. For days, the onlookers have been crowded, and the roads have been blocked.</p>

<p>The more than 700 workers of the Yingchang Match Factory in this port followed the 嘗政 decision and went to work at the factory at 7 am the day before yesterday (28th). Because no one from the factory was in charge, the Match Workers' Union telegraphed the Party, government, and police to send personnel to enforce it. Later, Ruan Yanying, Zhou Mingjun, Jiang Jun, and others were selected by the three parties to go to persuade them and were given 200 yuan for maintenance costs. By about 10 pm on that day, the workers were still in the factory and refused to return home, requesting that the representative designate a date for the factory to open in order to provide relief. Then, Ruan Yanying, the representative of the county government, stated that the factory would be decided to open before August 1. The workers had previously scheduled the factory to open on the 26th, then postponed it to the 28th, but it still did not open. They were afraid that this time before August 1 would also be a fabrication. At that time, the representatives of the various supervisors gave the workers a final and firm answer, stating that if the factory could not open before August 1, the supervisors of the various departments would organize a maintenance committee to decide to open the factory in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers. 各 left the factory and went home to sleep. Yesterday (29th) morning at 7 am, the match workers held a meeting of supervisors and directors, attended by Bu Shouming, Wang Fulin, and 14 others, to discuss the method of distributing the maintenance fee. The resolutions were: 1. Old members will be paid. 2. Those who go home will not be paid. 3. Those who do not arrive will not be paid.</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Yin Tong, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, returned after the Dalian Conference and immediately went to Moganshan to meet with Huang Fu to report on the conference results. He has not yet come down the mountain to Shanghai. Only Chen Qingwen, the Chief of the Traffic Department of the bureau, remained at the hotel. Yin's luggage, which was sent back from Dalian, totaled more than thirty pieces and was entrusted to the China Travel Service for transportation. Unexpectedly, at 10 PM on the 28th, a man resembling a servant came to the Railway Bureau and asked to reserve two sleeping berths, claiming to be the servant of Chief Chen Qingwen. Because Chen planned to go to Beijing, the Railway Bureau prepared two sleeping berths for him, assuming he was Chen's servant. At the same time, the China Travel Service also received a phone call stating that Chen was going to Beijing tonight and asked them to send Yin's luggage to the train for Chen Qingwen to take with him. The China Travel Service also did not suspect anything and processed the large pieces of luggage with baggage tickets to be transported to Beijing by the Railway Bureau. However, according to the Railway Bureau's regulations, the remaining two small suitcases could be carried by passengers. Therefore, they were sent to Chen Qingwen's sleeping berth. Unexpectedly, at 11 PM that night, when the train was about to depart, the so-called Chief Chen Qingwen of the Beining Railway Traffic Department never boarded the train, and the man who had reserved the berth had also left. Moreover, the whereabouts of Yin and his entourage were kept extremely secret. For a moment, it was impossible to inquire. In that instant, it was discovered that the two small suitcases placed in Chen Qingwen's sleeping berth by the China Travel Service had disappeared. Initially, it was thought that the suitcases might have been mistakenly taken by Chen Weiqing, a secretary of the Ministry of Finance, because Chen Weiqing was also taking the train to Beijing that night, and his sleeping berth was next to Chen Qingwen's. However, it was later found that Chen Weiqing had not taken the suitcases from the adjacent room. Therefore, the whereabouts of the items are currently unknown. The Railway Bureau and the China Travel Service are still investigating whether Yin's luggage was lost or stolen, and whether the man claiming to be Chen Qingwen's servant was a thief who took them. They are conducting a thorough investigation to uncover the truth.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Foreign Trade Gradually Declining <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau released</p>
<p>The foreign trade situation for June</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the International Trade Bureau released the following information yesterday regarding China's foreign trade in June and the first half of this year:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Imports and Exports Both Decline <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In June, China's foreign trade saw a slight decline in both imports and exports compared to the previous month. Imports were 86,259,413 yuan, and exports were 49,172,796 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, the decline was even greater. Imports decreased by 23,839,473 yuan, and exports decreased by 1,030,594 yuan, with imports declining the most. Although this may seem like a good phenomenon on the surface, the reason is undoubtedly a sign of the general economic decline of the nation. The trade deficit for this month was 37,086,617 yuan. The total trade deficit for the six months of this year was 301,305,122 yuan, a decrease of 35.02 percent compared to the 474,641,566 yuan for the same period last year.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Countries of Import and Export <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>As for the countries of import and export, the United States still leads in imports, totaling 20,556,214 yuan. Japan is second, totaling 9,833,351 yuan. The United Kingdom is third, totaling 9,244,156 yuan. Germany is fourth, totaling 7,755,428 yuan. Next are Annam and British India, each with more than six million yuan. Compared with the same period last year, the United States and India have slightly increased, while Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany have all decreased, with Annam decreasing the most. In exports, Hong Kong still leads, totaling 8,405,240 yuan. Japan is second, totaling 8,166,611 yuan. Next is the United States, totaling 7,412,547 yuan. As for the United Kingdom, it also reached 6,372,877 yuan. Germany and France, and other countries are below two million yuan. Hong Kong has slightly increased compared to the same period last year, while the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom have all decreased, with Japan decreasing the least.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Main Import and Export Goods <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>As for the main import and export commodities, rice is the top import for this month, totaling 5062.88 gold units. Metals are second, totaling 4,102.69 gold units. Cotton is third, totaling 3,367.476 gold units. Other imports include machinery at 2,900,221 gold units, paper at 1,810,376 gold units, and cotton goods at 1,026,818 gold units. In addition, kerosene, wheat, sugar, etc., all reached more than 800,000 gold units. As for the top import for the six months of this year, it should be cotton, due to the import of American cotton. Others include metals, rice, and kerosene. Tea is the largest export, totaling 5,008,468 yuan. Egg products are second, totaling 3,725,638 yuan. Other exports include cotton yarn at 3,583,721 yuan, tung oil at 3,008,118 yuan, and leather goods at 2,047,583 yuan. Silk and peanuts are between 1.6 and 1.7 million yuan. The total export volume for the six months of this year is the largest for leather goods, followed by cotton yarn, egg products, and tea. Compared with the total export volume for the first half of last year, all goods have declined, especially raw silk, which has declined the most. Only leather goods have slightly increased.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Trade Situation in Various Ports <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>As for the ports of import and export, Shanghai is the main port for sales. Imports for this month totaled 45,595,877 yuan, accounting for 52.4 percent of the total. Exports totaled 24,476,909 yuan, accounting for 49.8 percent of the total. This shows its importance. Among other ports, Kowloon, Tianjin, and Jiaozhou are next in imports, and Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, and Jiaozhou are next in exports. Compared with last month, Shanghai and Jiaozhou have decreased in both imports and exports. Tianjin's exports are slightly lower, Hankou's exports have doubled, Kowloon's imports and exports have increased, and the rest are stable.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Silver Still Has a Trade Surplus <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the import and export of gold and silver, the total import of silver coins and raw silver for this month was 165,510 yuan, and exports reached 13,101,937 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 12,936,427 yuan. For the six months of this year, the total surplus of silver coins and raw silver was 28,764,437 yuan. The total surplus of gold coins and raw gold was 18,169,488 gold units. Although both show a decrease compared to the surplus in the same period last year, it is still not something to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>A government document states, "Submitted to maintain domestic rice and prevent foreign rice imports to aid agriculture, requesting review and approval for implementation to save the bankrupt rural areas." According to the statement from the 26th branch of this association, "There has been a drought this year (the original text has been recorded in previous newspapers, omitted), sincerely praying," etc. Foreign rice imports result in the outflow of profits every year. The result of bankrupt rural areas is due, in part, to this problem. Our government is currently planning to revitalize the countryside. Domestic rice should be maintained. The price of rice is related to the people's food. On the one hand, foreign rice imports should be prevented. On the other hand, the government must strictly investigate those who hoard and speculate and give them appropriate punishment so that the rice supply is abundant and will not be raised in price by unscrupulous merchants, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people. It is necessary to prevent foreign rice imports and make appropriate arrangements to maintain agriculture. It is appropriate to submit a document to your government for review and implementation. Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Soybean and Rice Trade Association Held an Extraordinary General Meeting Yesterday and Decided to Abandon the Purchase of Foreign Rice <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Convened a Food Meeting</p>
<p>Scheduled to be held at Cuixiu Hall this afternoon</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, due to opposition from all parties to the purchase of foreign rice and the Ministry of Finance's refusal to approve tax exemptions on imports, convened a general meeting of all members at 3 PM yesterday and decided to abandon the purchase. The food meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to be held at Cuixiu Hall today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e122">Attending Representatives <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>

<h3 id="e123">Decision to Stop Purchasing <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The chairman first reported that the motive for the previous proposal to purchase foreign rice, the approved tax exemption for imports, and the subsequent decision by the Ministry of Finance that the tax could not be reduced or exempted because it had been passed by the Legislative Yuan, as well as letters of opposition from rice industry groups from various regions, were reported. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters one after another, and the Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association sent a letter and received a telegram from the Changsha Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the purchase of foreign rice not be made. The proposal was discussed, and it was decided that the government could not exempt a portion of the tax on the purchase of foreign rice, so it should be abandoned for the time being. Other internal matters were also discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Food Meeting <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>

<h3 id="e125">Qinghai Prince Ya Lengpile Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Talking About the Inspection Experience and the Political Situation in Qinghai</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Ya Lengpile, the Assistant State Duke of the Right Wing of Qinghai, also known as Qingzhai, is the younger brother of the leader of the 29th Banner of Qinghai. Two years ago, he was ordered to go to various parts of the country to inspect industry and commerce as a reference for the construction of the province. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago and is scheduled to return to the province to report his mission within a few days. A Central News Agency reporter visited Ya at his residence yesterday and asked him about the inspection experience and the political situation in Qinghai. According to Ya's remarks,</p>
<h3 id="e126">Inspection Experience <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Ya first talked about the inspection experience, saying that the people of the Twenty-ninth Banner, in view of the importance of Qinghai's construction, sent him to various parts of the country to inspect. He visited Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces, and conducted a detailed investigation of the industrial and commercial conditions in various places to serve as a reference for the future construction of Qinghai. He believes that the construction of Guangxi Province has the most vitality and is the most suitable for Qinghai to learn from. The mission has now been completed, and he plans to stay in Shanghai for a while before returning to Qinghai to report his mission. At the same time, he hopes that the industrial and commercial circles of the whole country will raise funds to invest in Qinghai. In other words, Qinghai is full of gold, and no one is picking it up, so he hopes that the people of the country will go there very much. He also hopes that all sectors will first organize inspection groups to go there for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Vast Land and Sparse Population <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Republic of China, Qinghai established the Qinghai Office Director in Xining. Later, due to the frequent incidents in Kulun and Tibet, the Mongol-Tibetan Appeasement Commissioner was added. In 1915, both positions were abolished and replaced by the Ninghai Garrison Commander, who governed the entire Qinghai region. After the establishment of the National Government, in 1928, it was ordered that the seven counties of Xining Dao in Gansu and the entire Qinghai region be designated as Qinghai Province. The province has an area of approximately 2.5 million square miles, with a distance of approximately 2,500 miles from east to west and more than 1,800 miles from north to south, as large as the four provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. The population is only 6.195 million, less than one-tenth of the population of Sichuan Province. The largest ethnic groups are Mongol and Tibetan, followed by Han and Hui. The political, economic, educational, and other powers of the province are in the hands of the Hui people. The climate is similar to that of Hebei and Shandong provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Declining Education <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Due to historical reasons, the people of Qinghai only know the local princes in their minds, so the power of the princes is extremely great. Their culture is low, and their knowledge is shallow, so the revitalization of education is the only urgent task at present. There are now more than 50 elementary schools in the province. Xining, where the provincial capital is located, has only four middle schools and vocational schools. The province's mineral resources are the richest in the country, such as salt, gold, silver, steel, coal, kerosene, jade, lead, iron, phosphorus, etc., which have not yet been developed. Industry and commerce are also extremely immature. Industry relies only on manual weaving, and medicine is the main export in commerce. Cloth, sugar, and wine are the most imported.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Inconvenient Transportation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Qinghai is separated from the interior due to inconvenient transportation. Therefore, the development of Qinghai should start with transportation construction. At present, the transportation situation in the province is centered on Xining by land. (1) Starting from Xining and going east, passing through Gaolan in Gansu, crossing Liupan Mountain, and reaching Xi'an, this is the main road to the interior. (2) Starting from Xining, going southwest, crossing the mountain ranges, passing between Erling and Zhaling Lakes, and crossing the Bayan Har Mountains again, passing Yushu in the west, crossing Dangla Mountain, and reaching Lhasa in Tibet, this is the main road within the province and the main road to Tibet. (3) Starting from Xining, circling along the coast of Qinghai, passing Dulan Temple, crossing Chaidamu, going northwest, and reaching the main road to Xinjiang. (4) Crossing the Blackwater from the province to the southwest can reach Tibet, and going southeast can reach Songpan on the border of Sichuan. Along the northeast into Gansu, you can enter the Great Wall and reach Ningxia. Due south along the Yangtze River, or crossing the southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, you can enter Xikang. There are two automobile roads. (1) The Lanhuan Automobile Road, from Lanzhou in Gansu to Huangyuan in Qinghai, is 450 miles long. This road has been completed. (2) The Xining Circular Automobile Road, starting from Xining, passing through Wuwei, Ningxia, Xiliang, Tianshui, and still ending in Xining, is 2,750 miles long. This road is still under construction. Water transportation is very inconvenient due to the uneven depth of the waterways. If dredged, water transportation will be as convenient as in the provinces south of the Yangtze River. However, it is difficult to travel by boat when the river freezes in winter. The current water transportation situation in the province is extremely simple, unlike the use of boats in the interior. From Xining to Huanglan, there are rafts along the Huang River. The post office has a general office in Xining, and each county has a branch office. The northwest connects to Dulan in the province, the southwest connects to Lhasa in Tibet, and there are many postal items to and from the interior. There is only one telegraph line, with the general office in Xining, passing through Gaolan to the provinces of the interior.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Explaining the Purpose of the Committee</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners and Pullers Still Have Many Doubts</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee rejected non-registration. The rickshaw business must be the result of the fact that rickshaws cannot have licenses. The members of the committee, Maxi, Zhu Cheng, and Wang Zhiren, gave a detailed report to reporters from various newspapers yesterday on the facilities of the Committee opposing the Rickshaw Owners Association and the licenses for rickshaws that have not been claimed after the deadline. The report of Maxi is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Purpose of Reform <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Maxi, first clarified two points: (1) The purpose of the Committee is not to make things difficult for rickshaw owners, but to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers and reform the style of rickshaws in order to develop the rickshaw business. The Committee anticipates that there may be conflicts of interest with the owners in order to achieve this goal, but the Committee will always take the development of rickshaw affairs as its mission. (2) The report that Yu Qiaqing's appointment as mediator was rejected by the Committee is absolutely not true. Mr. Yu introduced several rickshaw owners to the meeting for contact, but he himself never expressed his opinion and there was no mediation. Moreover, Mr. Yu is also a Chinese director. Working together under the organization of the Municipal Council, he is enthusiastic about social work and is respected by all sectors and colleagues. The Committee will be happy to accept any proposal from him on this matter, and there is no reason to reject it.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Consultation Process <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>(3) Mr. Maxi then reported on the consultation process with the rickshaw owners. The certificates for rickshaw owners were issued by the Municipal Council from June 1 to July 21. At that time, the rickshaw owners opposed the trade association and prevented the rickshaw owners from coming to the meeting to receive the certificates. When the deadline was reached, several rickshaw owners' leaders came to the meeting and formally requested the Committee to extend the deadline and guarantee that the rickshaw owners would apply for licenses as scheduled. The meeting accepted their request and extended the deadline to the 30th. However, one week after the extension, no rickshaw owners came to the meeting to apply for licenses. Their disregard for credibility and inconsistency are not sincere cooperation with the meeting. The significance of issuing the rickshaw owner certificate is to eliminate all kinds of malpractices in donation collection. (4) The rickshaw owners should also convey the purpose of the Committee to eliminate the rickshaw industry and help the development of trams and buses. This statement is completely contrary to the facts. The work of the Committee is based on the regulations of the Municipal Council. All its facilities are quite opposed to other businesses, because it has an impediment on the elimination of rickshaws. The general opinion is that after such a reform, rickshaws can continue to exist. (5) Some rickshaw owners have registered rickshaw pullers and limited the number to 40,000, saying that this disregards the lives of the coolies and is promoting this. All the registration regulations of the Committee are intended to give the rickshaw pullers a position in terms of personality, and the stipulation of 40,000 people is also to maintain a better life for the rickshaw pullers. There are now 10,000 rickshaws in the concession, and the distribution of 40,000 people will not affect their income.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Relief Association Matters <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(6) Regarding the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association, it was initiated automatically by the rickshaw pullers. Two or three months ago, many rickshaw pullers went to the Municipal Council to request the organization of a relief association. The Municipal Council believed that the rickshaw pullers' own organization could not concentrate power and was afraid that it would not achieve great results. Therefore, it was stipulated that donations would be collected at 1.5 yuan per car per month, and a committee would be elected to organize a custodial committee to manage the funds and allocate them for rickshaw pullers' livelihood, education, and health facilities. The rickshaw owners are trying to undermine it and are spreading malicious propaganda, which is not credible. They themselves are also promoting the relief of rickshaw pullers very vigorously, but why not reduce the rickshaw rent immediately? Their propaganda can only know. (7) Some rickshaw owners said that they will not be able to operate after reducing the rent according to the regulations of the Committee, but the meeting has received requests from more than 2,000 new rickshaw owners to issue about 20,000 rickshaw licenses, and said that they are willing to accept all regulations. It can be seen that the rickshaw owners can also operate after reducing the rent, and the current opposition of the rickshaw owners is obviously not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e134">License Extension <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's issuance of certificates to rickshaw owners has ended yesterday. During the period, about 45 percent (4,500 vehicles) of those who went to the bureau to receive them were calculated by vehicle. The new rickshaw licenses for August will be issued according to the certificates. The date for issuing the licenses was originally scheduled to end on August 6, but it has been extended from the 8th to the 13th due to the tax office's unprepared procedures. Those who do not donate licenses after the deadline will be prohibited from operating. The rickshaw owners stated that if this matter is not resolved immediately, they will implement a rent strike. Mr. Maxi told reporters that he hoped that this kind of dispute would not occur. Otherwise, if public security is disturbed, it will be severely punished. The rent reduction will also be implemented from the 1st of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Rickshaw Owners Attitude <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Rickshaw Industry Association's Special Zone Office, all member cars, approved this morning to take the current rickshaw owner's certificate to the Fair Road Rickshaw Inspection Office in accordance with past practices to obtain the vehicle inspection certificate, and then go to the Donation Office to pay donations and obtain a license. If the Donation Office insists that the rickshaw owners obtain the license with the lease certificate and in accordance with the new regulations, they will unanimously refuse to obtain it. At that time, rickshaws will inevitably be without a license and unable to operate. If this issue is not resolved in the shortest possible time, from the 14th of next month, the rickshaws in the Public Concession will inevitably be completely suspended due to the lack of a business license. It is also found that the rickshaw owner certificates issued by the Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee have not been certified by the donor and announced in the newspaper, so although only more than 200 copies of the issued certificates have been issued, 181 copies of the new certificates received by the rickshaw owners have been submitted to the Rickshaw Industry Association for review. It has been found that there are as many as 35 people with incorrect names on the list of rickshaw owners registered by the association and the list registered by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, totaling 177 vehicles. The industry association believes that the procedures for issuing rickshaw owner certificates by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee are not public, resulting in many errors, and has repeatedly requested careful handling, but has been ignored. It believes that its purpose is not to truly protect the property rights of rickshaw owners.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Carters' Public Letter <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the representatives of the rickshaw pullers sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating: "Respectfully submitted, in recent months, your bureau has devoted itself to the research of rickshaw problems and the relief of rickshaw pullers. You have spared no significant sacrifice to complete this arduous task, demonstrating your concern for the suffering of the poor, which is greatly admired. The plans you have set are centered on the interests of the rickshaw pullers. How fortunate are we to receive such generous favors, which we will never forget. However, upon reviewing the new regulations set by your bureau, there are still two points that cause concern, which we dare not ignore. We hereby list the points of concern as follows: (1) Upon investigation, your bureau is now organizing a mutual aid society to handle the relief work for rickshaw owners, with good intentions and excellent methods. However, it is also stipulated that the expenses of the society will be borne by the rickshaw pullers, ordering the rickshaw companies to collect one small silver coin from each rickshaw puller per day, totaling thirty small silver coins per month. Furthermore, a lump-sum donation is adopted, requiring rickshaw companies to pay one dollar and fifty cents in silver each month, with the remaining amount seemingly going to the rickshaw companies as compensation. It is inappropriate for the expenses of relieving rickshaw pullers to be taken from the rickshaw pullers themselves. Moreover, it is unclear what purpose is served by aiding rickshaw companies to obtain these illegal profits. This method seems to create a conflict of interest for the rickshaw pullers and gives the impression that your bureau is helping rickshaw companies to exploit them. This is our first question. (2) Upon investigation, your bureau has now set the rickshaw rental at ten small silver coins per day. We do not know whether this rental amount includes the scope of the Chinese, French, and British license agreements, or whether it is solely for the British license. If it includes all three license agreements, then has your bureau obtained the consent of the Chinese and French authorities, or have the Chinese and French authorities granted your bureau such special power? Otherwise, if it only refers to the British license, and if the Chinese and French authorities also follow suit, then wouldn't the rickshaw rental increase to thirty small silver coins? Compared to the original rickshaw rental of thirteen or fourteen small silver coins, wouldn't this be a rent increase? This is our second question. In summary, we dare not harbor small-minded suspicions. We only hope that your bureau will provide a clear explanation as soon as possible to dispel public doubts. We are extremely grateful and await your instructions. Submitted by: Zhang Shide, Wang Fugui, Chen Lucai, Xu Shao San, Gao Wanfu, Li San, Representatives of the 100,000 Rickshaw Pullers of Shanghai Municipal Public Concession."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Foreign Press Reports <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the executive committee of the Rickshaw Owners' Association is currently engaged in informal negotiations with the authorities of the Public Works Department. The outcome may be a compromise reached at the last hour to salvage or at least postpone the riots caused by the new rickshaw regulations. According to reliable sources, if the negotiations proceed at the current rate, the Public Works Department may formally announce within days that it will postpone the implementation of part or all of the new regulations for one month, so that both parties can continue to discuss and resolve the current disputes in a proper manner. However, the actual nature of the compromise has not been disclosed by either party. According to responsible sources, if the two parties can reach an agreement, the Public Works Department will announce it in the form of a response to the Rickshaw Owners' Association's petition. Whether the postponement of the implementation of the new regulations will be for all or part of them is still unknown. However, it is heard that the clauses regarding reducing the daily rental fee to a maximum of ten copper coins, the rickshaw owners collecting one copper coin from the rickshaw pullers per day, and the rickshaw owners paying one dollar and fifty cents in advance to the Public Works Department per rickshaw to cover the expenses of establishing a mutual aid fund will all be postponed. If an agreement cannot be reached at the last hour, 60,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession will be unemployed by next Monday. The last hour is not as previously rumored on Wednesday, the day the new regulations for rickshaw licenses were to be implemented. According to rickshaw owners, the Public Works Department is withholding the issuance of new licenses for August due to the rickshaw owners' non-compliance with the new regulations. However, according to the usual practice, rickshaws can still operate on the streets of the Public Concession with July licenses until August 6th, which is next Monday morning. Although the Public Works Department may issue licenses to new rickshaw owners who declare their compliance with the new regulations, if the old rickshaw owners break with the Public Works Department, the number of rickshaws on the streets of the Public Concession will inevitably be small. This is because, as of the end of last week, there were only four new model rickshaws and a few new-style rickshaws in the concession. Moreover, new rickshaw owners cannot obtain licenses for the French Concession and the areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government. It is heard that the French Concession authorities are prepared to issue August licenses to 144 licensed rickshaw owners, and it is unlikely that the number of licenses will increase. Furthermore, the Public Works Bureau and the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government require the seal of the Rickshaw Owners' Association to issue licenses. Therefore, even if new rickshaw owners can obtain licenses from the Public Works Department, the rickshaws still cannot operate in the French Concession and the areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e138">First Summary of Travel Industry's Aviation Patriotic Donation <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the collection of the travel industry's aviation patriotic donation has been quite smooth since it was implemented on April 15th. Due to procedural issues, a few hotels temporarily suspended collection, which affected the overall collection. After the Municipal Government explained to the authorities of the two concessions that this patriotic movement should continue, the office of the Chief Captain of the Aviation Association obtained this satisfactory result and convened a meeting of travel industry representatives from the entire city on the 25th of last month to discuss promotion methods. The general meeting unanimously resolved to resume collection on July 10th. Later, due to the inability to complete various procedures in time, the notification to the entire travel industry to continue collection was postponed to the 28th of this month. Investigation officers were assigned to inspect various situations in different areas, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the office, in addition to notifying the travel industry to continue collection, also dispatched officer Zhang Yuliang to collect the aviation donations that the hotels had collected in the past, which were used for the first summary calculation.

<h3 id="e141">Tax Affairs Department Replies to Ministry of Finance: Customs Documents in Chinese <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department yesterday replied to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "According to Instruction No. 1349 of the Department, a document from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was issued by the Ministry, stating that the Shanghai Pen and Ink Industry Association proposed that the government order all customs houses in the country to implement the use of Chinese in official documents. After discussion, the general meeting believed that customs houses have been using Chinese for correspondence and announcements in recent years, or using both Chinese and Western languages together. However, tax bills and other documents still use Western languages, which merchants find most difficult. It was resolved to petition the Ministry of Finance to order all customs houses to use Chinese as the main language in all documents and request approval for implementation. Upon investigation, application forms, official announcements, and replies to merchants should all be mainly in Chinese. The internal documents, registers, books, and records of the customs house should be gradually changed to Chinese. It was ordered to comply with these instructions repeatedly in 1929. The petition states that tax bills and other documents are still mostly in Western languages, so it is ordered that all documents of the customs house be changed to Chinese in accordance with the previous order from the date of receipt of the document and reported truthfully. Having received this order, it has been found that since the order was issued in 1929 to use Chinese as the main language in application forms, official announcements, and replies to merchants, all customs offices were notified to change all application forms and documents related to merchants to Chinese. As for internal documents, registers, books, and records, they should also be gradually changed to Chinese to avoid confusion. The fourth 08 return document was prepared and requested for inspection and verification. Over the years, we have made every effort to plan and change the application documents to Chinese as much as possible. Currently, all formats are in both Chinese and English. Occasionally, there are several types of documents that, for the convenience of foreign merchants, include English notes in addition to Chinese. However, all are mainly in Chinese. As for declarations and tax bills, multiple copies are often filled out, and Chinese merchants often voluntarily use English typewriters for speed and convenience. As for filling out declarations and tax bills in Chinese, it should be at the merchants' convenience. There seems to be no difficulty in customs accepting them all. The reason for the previous order is to present the current situation in writing for your consideration. (Omitted below) Acting Inspector General of Customs, Loford."</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau Announces Collection of Land Value Tax in Yinxiang and Pusong Districts Starting Tomorrow <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Two-Month Deadline for Payment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued an announcement stating: "Announcement regarding the collection of the Provisional Land Value Tax Regulations and the scope of collection, and the start date of collection in this city.

Currently, the land in the Yinxiang District, including the fifth and sixth map districts Zhang, Lai, Shu, and Cang, and the land in the Pusong District, including the first map district Di, Huang, have been assessed for land value by the Land Valuation Committee and submitted by the Land Bureau in conjunction with this bureau to the Municipal Government for approval and announcement. All land within the above-mentioned areas that has been assessed for land value shall be subject to the second installment of the 1933 land value tax at a rate of six-fifths (i.e., the tax for the five months of the second half of 1933, from August 1 to December 31). Collection will begin on August 1 of this year, with a two-month deadline for payment, ending on September 30 of this year.

<h3 id="e143">Ministry of Railways Corrects Procedures for Handling Freight <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Proposed Improvements</p>
<p>Instructions Issued to Railway Bureaus Yesterday for Compliance</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that there are areas in the handling of freight by various railways that need to be corrected and improved. Therefore, it has proposed improvements and issued instructions to railway bureaus for compliance yesterday. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Ministry of Railways Instructions <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Industry Department Instruction No. 10441 states that according to the report by Deputy Director Tan Yaozong of the Ministry's Business Department and others who inspected the Ping-Sui Railway, it was found that other railways had areas in the handling of freight procedures that needed to be corrected and improved. Therefore, a checklist is hereby copied and issued for compliance and improvement. This order is issued.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Points for Correction <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The points that should be corrected in the handling of freight procedures are as follows: (1) In the arrival station stub of the freight bill, the arrival time is sometimes not filled in. Attention should be paid to filling it in at any time in accordance with the regulations. (2) When filling out freight bills, the detailed address columns for the consignor and consignee are too brief, often only stating the station name or "(station)" and so on, and sometimes they are even left blank. They should be filled out in detail in accordance with the regulations. (3) There is a lack of understanding of the calibration of scales and the method of using standard weights. The previous Ministry order on the use of standard weights for calibrating scales should be followed in accordance with the law. (4) The signatures of railway staff and station names on freight bills and various registers should no longer be in Western languages or Western language abbreviations. They should all be in Chinese. Those who affix seals should also affix seals in accordance with the regulations to uphold the national system and clarify responsibilities. (5) In the "method of payment of freight" column on the freight bill, the words "paid in advance" are arbitrarily written as "prepaid," "paid in cash," or "already paid." They should all be written as "paid in advance" to comply with the regulations and avoid confusion. (6) All stations with two or more small scales should be numbered together with all parts to prevent accidental misuse. (7) The station names of the departure station on the freight bill should be pre-stamped with the station name stamp to avoid temporary writing, which saves time and is clearer. (8) From now on, relevant department heads, section chiefs, and station managers of various railways should frequently contact local merchants, convene discussions at any time, and explain transportation methods and benefits, so that the responsible transportation system and other systems penetrate deeply into the private sector. This will inevitably have a remarkable effect on the development of railway transportation.</p>

<p>Playing on the Escalator and Falling Inadvertently</p>
<p>Burns from Boiling Water Cause Body Injuries and Death</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaoxizi, a seven-year-old child from Jiangbei, lived at No. 10, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, French Concession. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, he was playing with another child on the escalator when he accidentally lost his footing and fell. There happened to be a pot downstairs filled with boiling water. He fell directly into the pot. Because it was hot summer and his clothes were thin, the child was scalded by the boiling water and suffered injuries all over his body, a tragic sight. The French police were immediately notified and Officer No. 166 was dispatched to investigate the truth. The child was rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance. Due to the severity of the injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died of his injuries at noon.</p>

<p>Convenient Location for Transportation</p>
<p>Perpetrator Zhang on the Run, Source Unknown</p>
<p>Shengshun Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, faces North Railway Station Road and backs onto the old platform of the Songhu branch line. At about 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, the Zhabei Fifth District Office suddenly received a tip claiming that a large-scale red pill operation was located at No. 41 Shengshun Lane, specializing in selling to various locations along the Jinghu Railway. After hearing the news, Liang Fuchu, the district chief of the office, personally led Inspector Wang Zhizhang and other police officers to secretly investigate the address. They knocked on the door and entered the house, where they saw that several floorboards in the hall had been lifted. Upon closer inspection, there was a cellar underneath. There was nothing else in it. Knowing that something was amiss, Director Liang turned to check the west wing. The door was locked. He led the inspectors to climb in through the window and saw two large rattan boxes in the room. A middle-aged woman was directing two apprentice-like people to move the two rattan boxes backward. Director Liang asked what was in the boxes, but she hesitated and did not answer. He ordered them to put them down and open the boxes. It was discovered that they were filled with thread pills, 66 packages in total, with 10,000 pills in each package, totaling 600,000 pills. The woman and her apprentices were immediately detained and taken to the Fifth District Office along with the drugs. Director Liang personally interrogated her. According to the woman, who identified herself as Zhang Yinshi, 31 years old, from Danyang, the drugs were transported from the concession and then packaged and transported by her lover, Zhang Chaogang. Zhang works as a car guard on the Jinghu Railway. The cellar in the hall was used to hide the pills. When transporting the pills, they were moved from the back door to the old platform of the Songhu branch line and then sent to the train. Because each batch of drugs that arrived could not necessarily be transported immediately, they had to wait until Zhang himself was on duty with the train before he could take them out. When asked where Zhang was hiding and the source of the drugs, she hesitated and did not answer. Director Liang believed that the case was a criminal matter and filed a document with the General Bureau yesterday along with the drugs and prisoners. At the same time, he sent a document to various district offices to pursue the main perpetrator and the drug-making operation in order to thoroughly investigate the matter. If Zhang can be arrested, the source of the drugs will not be difficult to uncover.</p>

<p>Oda Shigeo Escorted Back to Japan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that Oda Toshio, a resident of Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture, claimed to be an explorer in January of this year. He went to Hankou and stated that he would travel through Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces before going to Nanyang for exploration. He repeatedly solicited donations there. Later, the Japanese consul in Hankou discovered the extortion and, after a severe reprimand, ordered him to return to Japan. Unexpectedly, he secretly came to China again and used the same tricks. The Consul General in Hankou knew that he had no intention of exploring and was solely seeking extortion as his goal. In addition to escorting him from Hankou to Shanghai, he also informed the police of the local Consulate General to escort him back to Japan on the Shanghai Maru today.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society Southeast Headquarters previously prepared a form and sent it to all branches, requesting them to fill it out as the disaster areas in the southeastern provinces were very large in order to coordinate the relief efforts. Yesterday, the office received a telegram from the Fuzhou branch reporting the severe flood in Yongtai. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society, the flash flood in Yangri Mountain, Yongtai County, Fujian Province, has caused unprecedented devastation. Countless people and livestock have been swept away, and houses have been destroyed. The disaster area covers more than 200 miles, with more than 100,000 victims camping in the open air, exposed to rain and sun, and dying one after another. Urgent assistance is needed. Please provide sufficient relief and quickly send personnel to investigate the disaster area to save those on the verge of death." After receiving the telegram, the association convened a meeting to discuss relief measures and appealed to all sectors of society on their behalf.

<h3 id="e153">Resolution of Rent Reduction Dispute in Yi'an Fang <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>10% Rent Reduction Effective from June</p>
<p>Street Cleaning Fees Also Cancelled Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Yi'an Fang housing complex on Rue Bourgeat (Xupu Stone Road) in the French Concession comprises forty or fifty buildings, owned by the Chinese Yi'an Company. The leasing is managed by lawyers Ye Shaoying and Yang Linzhi. Tenants, burdened by high rents and seeking rent reductions, formed the Yi'an Fang Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation Sixth District Branch. Their request for a 30% rent reduction was unsuccessful, leading tenants to withhold rent and deposit it in a bank. The landlord sued in the Second Special District Court, resulting in a dispute that lasted for over a month. The Citizens' Federation Sixth District Branch sent representatives Tong Lvzhang and Wu Guowei to mediate. The landlord showed understanding and appointed lawyers Ye and Yang to begin negotiations. As a result of discussions, it was decided that, starting from June, the original rent would be reduced by 10%. Street cleaning fees would also be cancelled simultaneously. Court cases would be withdrawn. The French Municipal Council tax would also be reduced proportionally to the rent reduction, based on landlord reporting. The Yi'an Fang Branch convened a general meeting of over forty tenants yesterday at 8:00 PM. Executive Director Huang Weiru and others reported on the peaceful resolution process. The tenants expressed satisfaction and decided that only members would enjoy the rent reduction benefit. Non-members would continue to pay the original rent as a warning to those who hesitated. It was also decided to host a banquet to thank all parties involved. All the above proposals were unanimously approved, and the meeting adjourned after 10:00 PM.</p>

On that day, Prosecutor Guo Wei was appointed by the court's prosecutor's office, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang and court clerk Wang Zuyi, to conduct an autopsy at the autopsy station. Since the cause of death could not be determined from the outside, forensic doctors Wei and Zhang were instructed to perform an autopsy. The forensic doctors determined that the cause of death was heart disease, triggered by stimulation at the time. The forensic doctors saw that Yu's head had slight injuries, so they also opened it to examine it, but found no damage. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo and others from the First Special Court again visited the autopsy station. The deputy chief of the patrol station reported that Ms. Yu Xin had been sent to the women's detention center. The patrol station is conducting an investigation.

<p>Zhang Fugen, a local resident, 34 years old, worked as a farmer. He currently lives at 12 Yangjia Port, south of Caohejing Town, western Shanghai. Years ago, Zhang married Ms. Zhuang from the Shijiazhaizhuang family in Meiyuan through a matchmaker. Less than two years after their marriage, Ms. Zhuang took her clothes and jewelry and eloped, and there has been no news of her for eight years. Since his wife disappeared, Fugen has been depressed, talking to himself all day long, as if suffering from a mental illness. Recently, the weather has been severely drought-stricken, and cotton and rice crops have withered, and farmland has cracked. Fugen told his old father that with such a year, how would they survive in the future? Rather than starve to death, it would be better to commit suicide. His father, Guan Quan, did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, Fugen used a kitchen knife to slash his neck around 9:00 PM the night before last. By the time Guan Quan discovered it, Fugen had already fallen in a pool of blood. He was rushed to Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi for treatment, but he had lost too much blood, and his throat was severed, so his life was unlikely to be saved.</p>

<p>Regulations for Awarding Honorary Gold Medals</p>
<p>Academic groups in Europe and the United States often have regulations for awarding honorary gold medals or medals to people who have made special contributions to construction projects. This is to encourage academic experts to devote themselves to construction projects. It can improve the country and society in small ways, and create happiness for mankind in large ways. The intention is excellent, so their countries are becoming richer and stronger, and talents are emerging in large numbers. It is not that they are not good at awarding and promoting success. The Chinese Institute of Engineers, in view of this, passed a resolution last year to award honorary gold medals, which was handed over to the board of directors for implementation. The fourteenth joint meeting of the board of directors recently passed seven articles on the method of awarding honorary gold medals. Anyone who receives the honor is not limited to members of the association, in order to achieve universality, but is limited to engineers of Chinese nationality. The methods are listed below: (1) The association may award honorary gold medals to people who have made special contributions to the engineering field in accordance with these methods. (2) The association's honorary gold medals are tentatively divided into one type. (3) Recipients of honorary gold medals must be Chinese citizens, but are not limited to members of the association. (4) The standards for special contributions in engineering are as follows: (A) Invention, (1) New engineering theories, (2) Mechanical items or manufacturing methods that benefit mankind and national defense, (B) Responsible for leading large-scale projects and solving technical difficulties to achieve success. (5) Any Chinese citizen who meets the standards of both items A and B of Article 4 may be proposed in writing by more than ten members of the association. After being approved by the association, the two departments of the board of directors will hire five experts to form a committee to review it. (6) If the review result is confirmed by the board of directors to comply with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of these methods, the association will award the honorary gold medal at the annual meeting. (7) If there are any matters not covered in these methods, the board of directors may amend them at any time.</p>

<p>Can Make Drinks Last Longer</p>
<p>Patent Requested from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Dong Guitao, a native of Ningbo, has been engaged in industry for many years. Three years ago, in view of the fact that soy sauce has a long history in China and is the only good thing for flavoring. After the opening of the sea, many of them are also sold abroad. Unfortunately, this thing is not durable. After a long time, it will grow white flowers, taste bad, or grow insects, which has a great impact on sales. Dong believes that foreign foods have a kind of preservative to prevent spoilage. However, there is hardly a special preservative for various foods in China, so he carefully studied and used scientific methods to refine a kind of Jiuwei Water. Not only can soy sauce not change its taste, but other liquid beverages such as local wine and Shaoxing wine will not change their taste after being put into this water. After several researches and experiments, it has been completely successful. The Datong News Agency reporter visited Dong yesterday and said that he has now been tested by the Industrial Testing Institute and requested a patent from the Ministry of Industry. At the same time, Ping Sheng Arts and Crafts Cooperative Society has been organized to manufacture this Jiuwei Water to revitalize the national soy sauce and other industries.</p>

<p>Stolen Seal to Change Safe Deposit Box Privately</p>
<p>Used a False Name to Threaten and Prevent Xu Bi's from Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>After Being Exposed, Father and Brother Returned Some of the Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Bi Furui Fled to Wuxi and Was Arrested</p>
<p>The woman, Ms. Xu, is over seventy years old. Her hometown is Shengze, Wujiang. The theft was discovered, but it was still unknown that Bi had done it, so she immediately reported it to the wife of the general tycoon Xu, known as the Fifth Madam Xu. Ms. Xu had private savings, bank stocks, pearls, diamonds, etc., worth about 100,000 yuan, all stored in safe deposit box No. 735 of the Zhongnan Bank. Ms. Xu had a nephew named Bi Furui, who was the accounting director of the Shanghai warehouse of the Beipiao Coal Mine Company. He was usually of good character, so he was deeply trusted by Ms. Xu. On July 20, 1932, Ms. Xu wanted to put jewelry into the vault, so she asked Bi to accompany her because she was old. Unexpectedly, Bi had bad intentions when he saw such valuable items. He deceived Ms. Xu because she was old and mentally weak, and took the opportunity to steal her seal. The next day, after accompanying Ms. Xu back to her hometown, he used the seal to go to the Zhongnan Bank and declared that the key to safe deposit box No. 735 was lost. He asked to open the box and change it to another box. The bank ordered him to find a shop to guarantee it. Bi found Xian Kanghua, Ningbo Road, to guarantee it. He transferred all the items from No. 735 to safe deposit box No. 1064. He then took out all the stored jewelry and stocks one after another, but Ms. Xu never knew the inside story.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1933, Bi learned that his aunt was coming to Shanghai to inspect the jewelry in the box. Fearing that things would be exposed, he wrote two threatening letters under a false name and sent them to Xu Bi's. The wording in the letters roughly stated that Xu Weixuan, your son, owes Yu 20,000 yuan. If it is not returned, you will be dealt with in Shanghai by considerable means. Ms. Xu was frightened when she received the letter and cancelled her plan to come to Shanghai. In the autumn of that year, she planned to come to Shanghai again, but she received two more threatening letters with bullets attached, and a young man in a suit came to Ms. Xu's house to make various threats, so she did not make the trip again. Unexpectedly, in May of this year, Ms. Xu suddenly decided to come to Shanghai. She wrote a letter to Bi Furui in advance and asked him to wait at the North Station on the 25th. Bi knew that he could no longer stop her, but remained calm and waited on time, and accompanied her to stay temporarily at the Shentai Hotel on Tianjin Road. Bi made an excuse to go out, and as soon as Bi went out, the man in the suit followed. Ms. Xu was shocked when she saw him and immediately moved to the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, and immediately went to the Zhongnan Bank to open the safe deposit box, only to find that her 100,000 yuan family fortune was completely missing. The case was assigned to Chief Detective Jiang Shangpei and Detective Mao Yunlong of the Concession Police to investigate.</p>
<p>At this time, Ms. Xu suddenly received a letter from Bi Furui, roughly admitting that he had done this, and saying that he was going to commit suicide. Bi Furui's father, Bi Yunbo (i.e., Yinbo), and Furui's brother, Yu Cheng Bingxie (i.e., Bingxie), also contacted Wang Fusheng (i.e., Fosheng), the Anhui captain of the Second District of the Jiangsu Water Provincial Public Security Team, and negotiated with Ms. Xu, willing to return 40% of the stolen goods as a settlement. Ms. Xu agreed. Wang immediately took the three members of the Bi family to Ms. Xu's residence at No. 6, Lane 60, Avenue Edward VII on the 24th of this month, and the stolen goods were part of them, including 214 bank stocks, 46 pieces of jade, 11 large colored gemstones, 6 small rubies, 4 sapphires, 211 pearls, and two gold diamond bracelets. Two gold bracelets were arrested and sent to the First Special Court by detectives Jiang and Mao. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for harboring stolen goods. Because Bi Furui was on the run and had not been arrested, the news was temporarily withheld.</p>
<p>The detectives Jiang and Mao learned that Furui was hiding in the New World Hotel in Wuxi, under the pseudonym Wang Jimin. They took the arrest warrant from the First Special Court to Wuxi on the 26th, but he was no longer there. After learning that he had gone to Suzhou, they rushed to Liumen and arrested him. He was brought back to the police station the day before yesterday. According to his confession, after Ms. Xu reported to the police station, he took the jewelry worth more than 20,000 yuan and fled to Yingkou. Unexpectedly, he was searched by the Japanese police there, who believed that he was providing assistance to the rebel army. All the jewelry was completely confiscated. Bi was released with a certificate from the Beipiao Company in Yingkou. Seeing his father Yunbo's advertisement in the newspaper, he was called back to Shanghai, so he returned to Wuxi. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case and prosecuted him for theft under Article 337 of the Criminal Law, requesting a joint trial with the Wang Fusheng case. Questioning Bi Furui fully confessed and hired lawyers Yuan Yangan and Fan Gang to defend him. Xu Bi's also hired lawyer Zhang Yuanmei to file a civil lawsuit. Judge Zhan Liangce verified the confession and ordered that the case be rescheduled for trial. Bi Furui was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>The Owner of the Construction Factory Shot His Aunt and Aunt and Then Killed Himself</p>
<p>The Two Had an Affair Long Ago</p>
<p>A Sudden Quarrel Leads to a Tragedy</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a bloody case occurred at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Haifang Road in western Shanghai. The deceased were the uncle and aunt. The details are bizarre. The circumstances are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e170">Getting Married into the Family <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Li Jianyun is from Nanhui County, Pudong, 35 years old, and lives at No. 810, the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Haifang Road in western Shanghai. He also runs the Chuntai Xieji Construction Factory. Li's wife, Ms. Lu, is also from Nanhui. Initially, Ms. Lu was extremely favored by her mother, and she did not allow her to marry, so she recruited Jianyun to marry into her family. Ms. Lu has a younger brother who married Ms. Chen, named Zhanlian, who is also from Nanhui. The couple had a good relationship. Li Jianyun saw each other early and late, and because they were a family, they were very friendly to each other.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, Ms. Chen's husband suddenly died of illness in previous years. At that time, Li personally handled the funeral affairs for his brother-in-law, showing great diligence. Who knew that Li saw that his aunt, Ms. Chen, was graceful and attractive, and had bad intentions long ago. Moreover, she was a young widow. Li then tempted Ms. Chen with sweet words. Soon, Ms. Chen was indeed tempted and fell into his trap. The two were affectionate and extremely loving. Unexpectedly, the opportunity was not secret, and Li's wife, Ms. Chen, discovered it and had a big dispute with her husband and condemned him with great righteousness. However, Li turned a deaf ear and lived with Ms. Chen.</p>

<p>Ms. Lu could not think of any way to do this, so she often ridiculed and persuaded her sister-in-law. Unexpectedly, the two were deeply in love and regarded Ms. Lu as a thorn in their side. In April of this year, she came to Shanghai from Nanhui and lived in the construction factory on Xiaoshadu Road, living together like a couple. Recently, Ms. Chen believed that because Ms. Lu's relationship had not ended, there would inevitably be trouble in the future, so she often forced Jianyun to take further action to drive Ms. Lu out or implement a divorce. However, Li was reluctant to say anything because of his love for his wife, but he could not bear to disappoint his lover, so he perfunctorily dealt with the matter.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen recently received a letter from his elder brother, Moquan, which specifically urged Mr. Chen to quickly marry Li Jianyun, stating that otherwise, he would inevitably regret it in the future, and so forth. Therefore, Mr. Chen once again raised the previous proposal with Jianyun, but Li still responded vaguely. Chen was dissatisfied and a major conflict arose. Yesterday morning, around 8 o'clock, Li and Chen both got up at the same time and immediately washed up in the room. Chen saw that Li looked calm, so he questioned him again about the marriage arrangements. Unexpectedly, the two had only exchanged a few words when another argument broke out, neither yielding to the other.</p>

<p>Seeing that Chen became increasingly agitated, Li Jianyun, overwhelmed with anger for a moment, drew the Mauser six-inch handgun he had prepared and fired two shots at Chen in quick succession, one hitting the temple and one hitting the chest. Chen fell to the ground on the spot, bleeding profusely, and died in the bedroom. At that moment, Li's maid, seeing the mistress being shot by the master, was terrified and screamed, quickly turning around and running out to call for help. At the same time, Li, realizing that he had caused a major disaster, also raised his gun and fired a shot at his own temple, collapsing next to Chen's corpse. By the time the maid had summoned the police, both were already dead. The police were immediately notified at the Gordon Road Police Station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. A vehicle was sent to transport the bodies of the man and woman separately to the Bao Long and Guang Ren Hospitals for examination, and then to the coroner's office to await examination. Staff were also dispatched to notify the families of the deceased.</p>

The plaintiff, Huang Futang, and the defendant, Kuang Menghuai, editor of the Shanghai newspaper, agreed that the Shanghai newspaper would publish a correction in its original position for three days to avoid litigation.

<h3 id="e188">A Word about Canceling Registration <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Recently, we have received many letters from readers stating the reasons for not communicating for a long time; and requesting that their registration not be canceled immediately, still wanting to be our reading friends. We are very gratified by this. In some letters, there were also discussions about our attitude towards readers. Regarding this, we seem to have to say a few more words:</p>
<p>Our relationship with readers has always been based on common interests and unforced friendship. We are not in a school-student relationship. The bond between us is formally looser than that between a school and its students, but it is more firm in spirit. This can be explained by the facts since July.</p>
<p>If that is the case, why do we repeatedly urge readers who have not written for a long time, and even use cancellation of registration to urge them? Why do we still issue achievement survey forms to examine readers' achievements? Isn't this a contradiction?</p>
<p>No! This is not a contradiction. Although we are friends, we are not ordinary friends. We are now all willing to seriously discuss scholarship. We are not literati, discussing scholarship is not for leisure. We are all struggling for life while still wanting to acquire a little knowledge to cope with our lives. Since our friendship is so serious, it should not only be a communication of knowledge, but also a supervision of life. Therefore, all forms of supervision that we adopt for readers are based on this principle. This is one.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of our work, although we are sincerely serving others and do not need to emphasize form, we cannot do anything without scientific theory. We cannot blindly shout about reading without a plan or answer questions at will. For the sake of our work, we must make various statistics in order to thoroughly understand what we have done and whether readers have benefited from it. What were the past shortcomings and mistakes, and what should be done in the future? If there are changes in the composition of readers, we should naturally adapt to them. We really need to have a very clear understanding of readers' lives.</p>
<p>Third, it has now been found that there are more and more people asking "Reading Q&amp;A". People from other cities are constantly joining the Reading Guidance Department. Their attitudes are very sincere, and we have no reason to refuse them casually. At the same time, we have limited manpower and cannot infinitely expand our work. Therefore, our only option is to cancel the registration of friends whose interest has decreased and let friends with good interest fill in. This is the actual reason for canceling registration this time.</p>
<p>In short: We sincerely hope that there is no need for any coercion between us and readers, but we cannot do without some necessary "forms". Because reading cannot be completely "anarchistic".</p>

<p>Introducing a Book of Poetry That Everyone Can Understand</p>
<p>The new poetry movement in China has a history of more than ten years. However, the poems produced in these ten years are things that we cannot understand or get used to. These poems are for the appreciation of the general intellectuals, not written for us.</p>
<p>The previous month, this newspaper's "Reading Q&amp;A" introduced us to a "New Poetry" folk song special issue. After reading it, I felt very fond of it, because there were no difficult or Europeanized sentences, no dizzying techniques, and the descriptions were all of lives that were closer to ours. Especially, these folk songs are very much to our taste. Therefore, I have always been looking forward to the early release of its creative special issue to meet us. Now, following the folk song special issue, this creative special issue has met us again. There are a total of thirty-six creations in this creative special issue. After reading them, I wrote some thoughts behind:</p>
<p>Among these works, "Obstructing Transportation" (poetic drama) and "Six Soldiers" (mass chorus poem) are worth special attention. Because these are very fresh forms, "Obstructing Transportation" is well written. It depicts the rulers' exploitation of the peasants, which is very moving. At the same time, the author's use of the boatmen's singing, "Hang yo... Hai ya..." is natural and powerful, turning it into a kind of rhythmic natural music. "Mass Chorus Poem" is very necessary, but I think "Six Soldiers" is not successful. I have called several people to sing it together, but there are many places where it cannot be sung together. It is not tense to sing, and it is difficult to understand. Many characters' words must be introduced like a play before it works. I hope they will publish more such poems in the future, and they should be more advanced and able to be sung together.</p>
<p>The other thirty-four poems, except for "Great Love", are all worth reading. However, looking at the whole, the expression methods are not uniform. For example, "Night Wanderer" and "I am Watching" are influenced by the Crescent School, and "Stone Crushing Girl", "Frog", "Autumn Harvest", etc. are somewhat like "modern" poems. The forms of the rest, such as "Can't Go, Brother", "Coal This Fellow", "Dike Keeper", "To Father", "Little Sanzi", "Grandpa's Cow"... are more free, and the words are more natural.</p>
<p>Among the long poems, I love "Coal This Fellow", "Our Fort", "To Father", "Grandpa's Cow" and "Little Sanzi" the most. They depict various lives, and see their "way" from life. They all have empty shouts, and no crazy cries. With heavy and delicate strokes, they write out the past suffering of various lives, and a kind of lingering emotion binds the hearts of readers.</p>
<p>Among the short poems, I love "Village Afternoon" and "Stone Crushing Girl" the most. The former vividly expresses the outline of the countryside, the past prosperity, and the current collapse in just a dozen sentences. The latter expresses the life of the stone crushing girl and the contradictions of society very well.</p>
<p>The poem "Frog" is very similar to "modern" poetry, and it is written too vaguely. The public cannot see the theme. The writing of "Sea Breeze" seems to be a memory, but I don't think it is consistent, not too suitable. "Great Love" is a romantic technique of Guo Moruo's era, and it is not harmonious with the whole book of poems.</p>
<p>However, in any case, we must admit that "New Poetry" is the only rare flower in the Chinese poetry world. It is a poetry that dares to get rid of all the old shells and create songs for the public to listen to. I dare to introduce this book to friends who are not intellectuals.</p>
<p>This is our own poetry that we can understand!</p>

<p>—Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Apart from the special vehicles I have already mentioned above, the remaining vehicles are where the eunuchs live. However, because there are many people and few vehicles, they are squeezed so densely that there is no space left. It's almost as if they are about to pile up. Although I haven't visited often, I don't know how they live. However, I imagine that their situation must be not much different from the sardines packed in those flat cans.</p>
<p>In China, there is no name for "sardines", but since I have thought of this interesting analogy, I certainly can't help but publish it. So I finally said to a eunuch:</p>
<p>"You people are squeezed into those vehicles, just like small fish!" Then, I explained to him in detail how foreigners pack sardines into those flat cans. After listening, he couldn't help but laugh. So my release of this word was immediately spread by him. One person told ten, ten people told a hundred. In no time, all the eunuchs knew! Of course, it couldn't be hidden from Li Lianying! But Li Lianying didn't live with them anyway. He also had a special vehicle. My words were certainly not sarcastic to him, so he certainly couldn't be angry! But the other eunuchs might not be happy to be called small fish by others, right?</p>
<p>In Beijing, people have a very common nickname for eunuchs, called "雄雞兒" (male chicks), because the voices of those eunuchs are always very sharp and high, just like the sound of a rooster crowing. So everyone agrees that this nickname is very appropriate. I think the eunuchs themselves are willing to accept it, because "雄雞" (rooster) is always better than "小漁" (small fish).</p>
<p>Readers, imagine: a thousand eunuchs, each wearing a full set of uniforms, but the few vehicles they occupy can only accommodate four hundred people. Can you endure such a comfortable life? (94)</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Way to Propose <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>Proposing is an art. You can't be stupid. You have to be smart and adapt to the situation.</p>
<p>For example, if you and she go swimming together, you can create your opportunity in the pool, grab her, and say to her in a traceless way: "I always wanted to find a background to propose to you. Do you think this background is good?" Give her a surprise. If she agrees, and she is a naughty girl, she will ask: "What background?" Then she will smile and swim away. At that time, you can chase after her, grab her again, and the problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Aren't there many opportunities like this?</p>
<p>Just make sure you speak tactfully and clearly, so that she can hear your words and understand your meaning. If she pretends to be confused at that time, you don't have to repeat your explanation. It's obvious that you still won't get her permission if you say it again. I remember a gentleman who lost an opportunity because he spoke vaguely. He said to a lady, "I love you." The lady said, "Thank you." The gentleman thought the lady refused. The lady was waiting for the gentleman to make a further request, preparing to agree, but she didn't wait. So this matter passed. Later, the lady had another lover. This gentleman went to see that lover, wanting to ask him to give way. Begging is not allowed in anything, let alone in the arena of love between men and women. This gentleman's failure is naturally expected.</p>
<p>Also, people generally think that proposing is a man proposing to a woman. Many clever ladies are secretly laughing at this. She designed a situation for you, but you don't know. You easily let it down? Some know it but don't use it, thinking that they will maintain the status quo for a while, waiting for a more mature period. The former is stupid, needless to say. The latter is also stupid, because what she gives you after that is gradual indifference, or even sudden disgust. Friend? It's definitely not the more mature period you imagined, right?</p>
<h3 id="e193">Thousand Mile Blind Man <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Bophong</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Blind Man is a famous rogue lawyer in our county (Changxing). In lawsuits within a thousand miles, once he takes on the case, there is no one who does not win. There are two things that can prove his ability is good!</p>
<p>One day, near the end of the year, he was returning to Changxing from Huzhou. In the boat, the boatman kept complaining to him. He asked the boatman if he needed money. If he needed money, when the boat passed Hongxing Bridge, he should crash into the waterside pavilion of a rich family! The boatman agreed repeatedly. When they arrived at Hongxing Bridge, he really crashed into the waterside pavilion of a certain family and broke the pillars. This family argued with the boatman. Thousand Mile Blind Man walked to the bow of the boat, slapped the boatman in the face, and scolded, "You are really bastard, did you shake the boat into someone's house? Can't you see me, Thousand Mile Blind Man? Today, please send him to the county." This family, intimidated by the reputation of Thousand Mile Blind Man, and knowing that they were guilty of privately occupying the official river, instead gave two hundred yuan to the boatman as the cost of repairing the boat.</p>
<p>When a certain county magistrate took office, he heard of the bad name of Thousand Mile Blind Man and framed him with stolen goods, arresting him. Thousand Mile Blind Man hid himself in a sack and ordered his family to carry him into the county hall. He asked the thief, "I, Thousand Mile Blind Man, have no grievances with you in this life, and no enemies in the previous life. Why do you say that I am sharing stolen goods on the spot? But do you know if I have pockmarks on my face? Do I have a beard?" The thief stared blankly and could not answer. He realized his conscience and said that the county magistrate had bought the thief to frame the good." The county magistrate was stunned. In a few days, the county magistrate was sued by Thousand Mile Blind Man and thrown into prison.</p>

<p>— Xiong Yu</p>
<p>A certain magnate is known for his poetry and painting skills, and is very frugal in his self-support. He does not wear fur in winter or silk in summer, eats no heavy flavors, lives in seclusion, and hardly asks or hears about worldly affairs. Only addicted to tea, three cups a day, without interruption. There is a maid named Qingxiang who, in addition to miscellaneous chores, specializes in this matter, never relying on others. According to her, she has never drunk tea made by others in her life, which shows how exquisite his tea drinking is. What the magnate likes are Longjing and Phoenix Tail. As for the storage of tea leaves, the suitability of cooking, and the antiquity of the teapot, he does have a unique approach. Most of the teapots he collects are made of purple clay, in various shapes and sizes. The three commonly used ones are all Mansheng pots. He uses them in the morning and evening without any confusion, and specifically names them Morning Pot, Middle Pot, and the pot he drinks before going to sleep is not called Evening Pot or Night Pot, but Dream Pot. One day, a monk came from Putuo Mountain and gave him two tubes of genuine Phoenix Tail tea. At that time, the lotus flowers in the courtyard were in full bloom. The magnate immediately took a pinch of Phoenix Tail and placed it in the flower, tying it lightly. He took it out the next morning, and it was fragrant and timeless, with a special flavor. On this day, Qingxiang was ill, so he ordered an old woman to brew it according to the method. Soon, she brought the pot in. The magnate opened the lid of the pot and immediately realized something. He said, "The old maid is ignorant and secretly sipped my Lotus Fragrance Phoenix Tail Tea!" He immediately called her over and scolded her again and again, but the old woman swore not to admit it. The magnate said, "I have been drinking tea all my life and know it well. When tea is first brewed, its leaves float and sink, and the state is chaotic. This can be used to measure it, and it never fails. But this tea is not like that. Look at the leaves in the pot. Their tips are all facing the spout. It's okay to tilt it slightly, but now you have secretly sipped it all up! What else can you say?" The old woman blushed and retreated.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirty-Two: The Generals Enjoy Themselves with Pleasure All Day Long, and the Old and Young Cry, How Many Soldiers Return?</p>
<p>He used to read newspapers and didn't pay attention to national affairs. Today, he suddenly felt that this important news was the text he was most concerned about. This small newspaper simply said that the enemy attacked Ping'an Fort the night before yesterday with three kinds of weapons: airplanes, artillery, and tanks. The national army defending the fort resisted desperately, but later ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, so the fort fell. As for the whereabouts of the army, it is not known. But are Zhao Ziqiang and his men the ones who died defending the city? I don't even know. So, besides reading this small newspaper, he continued to pick up the second newspaper to read. When he saw the third copy, it was a large newspaper. The large newspaper simply printed the three characters "Ping'an Fort" in a particularly large font. The content generally said that the enemy attacked fiercely, and the national army defended desperately. Battalion Commander Bao Fang died with the city. Although this battle was completely annihilated, it won back a lot of honor for the Northeast Army. The Northeast Army should encourage themselves. Gui Zhi didn't understand these classical Chinese very well, but he guessed that it was definitely not good news. He was now anxious to know the truth of the matter, and he could no longer hide it from the old man. So he took a large stack of newspapers and walked to the door of Zhao Weng's room, first calling out "Dad". Zhao Weng trembled for a long time before answering, "Come in." When Gui Zhi walked in, he saw Zhao Weng with one hand resting on the table, pressing on a newspaper, and the other hand pinching a dry towel, rubbing his eyes all the time. Even though he was rubbing like that, the tears still kept rolling down. Obviously, this old man had also received this bad news. He was stunned for a moment, standing and looking at Zhao Weng, he said, "Dad, have you seen the newspaper too?" Zhao Weng shook his head twice, then nodded twice, and said, "This...this is nothing, soldiers, that's what they should do." As he spoke, his throat couldn't help choking, unable to say anything further. Gui Zhi didn't need to ask what the news was. Seeing the old man's appearance, tears were already hanging on both sides of his face like a string of beads. He leaned against the door of the room involuntarily, and kept sobbing. (445)</p>

<p>— (Tao Ran)</p>
<p>"I don't know what benefits movies can give me, except money. Money is useful to people like me, because I am already seventy-eight years old." The world's great writer, the playful old man, Bernard Shaw, these words are really humorous.</p>
<p>Originally, in this world, besides money, what else is worth savoring? Why only movies, why only for a seventy-eight-year-old man?</p>
<p>Fortunately, Bernard Shaw was not born in China, so he can still have a fixed amount of income to allocate, handle, and for retirement. But what about in China?</p>
<p>Chinese writers have never been worth money. Chinese writers who wield pens can hardly even afford the minimum living expenses!</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, why did the suicides of Zhu Xiang and Zhang Baiyi happen one after another?</p>

<h3 id="e198">The Key to Washing Your Face <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Water is an indispensable element for skin hygiene, but what kind of water is most suitable for washing your face, and what kind of water should be used by what kind of people, are all different. Water has the distinction between hard water and soft water. Any water containing lime salt, Magnusium salt, etc. is called hard water. If you use this water to wash the face of someone with unhealthy skin, it will often be stimulated and the skin will become rougher. (Well water can also be hard water.) Even if you use soap, it will not be effective. Hard water can be turned into soft water by boiling it, adding some boric acid, borax, or adding some Glycerin.</p>
<p>The number of times you wash your face cannot be fixed. Often, due to occupational reasons, some people wash it more than ten times a day. Usually, you wash it three times after each meal or once before going to bed. For beauty, it is advisable to use cold water to wash your face. There is an old saying: washing your face with cold water can maintain a youthful appearance even in old age. However, both cold water and warm water have the power to remove fat. It is advisable to wash with warm water for skin with a lot of fat or people with acne. Also, for parts that often sweat and have a lot of fat, the genitals of people with diabetes, kidney disease, and urinary tract diseases, the armpits of people with body odor, and the anus of people with hemorrhoids, you should wash them more often every day. If there is secretion, you can mix half zinc oxide and half talcum powder. After washing, apply it to each part. People with anemia and soft skin should not wash their faces with cold water. People with skin diseases such as eczema and impetigo should not wash too much, because people with eczema generally have weak skin. If they have acute inflammation, the skin will be red, swollen, and eroded. Even if scabs form, it will be very itchy. At this time, hard water should be avoided. For skin diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus (or chain-like Streptococcus) in impetigo, if you are not careful when washing your face, it will spread to the entire face. For people with unhealthy skin, after washing your face, you should gently rub it with a dry cloth. If you use soap, whether it contains free Alkali can be determined by tasting the soap with the tip of your tongue. If the tip of your tongue feels very irritating and numb, it is determined to be a bad product. However, even if the quality of the soap is good, you should pay attention to whether it is suitable for our skin. If it is very irritating to the skin, you should not use it again. Before soap was invented, rice bran was used as a facial cleanser. Today, the medical community also considers it effective. For example, it is very suitable to use a pinch of rice bran soaked in hot water to wash the face (sewn in a cloth bag) for skin with acne and other red swelling. After washing, you should wash off the rice bran residue and not leave it on the skin to avoid subcutaneous effects. If you are traveling outside and can't find suitable soft water, never wash your face. If you can't wash your face with water due to illness, then use Cooling Cream or alcohol (half alcohol and half water) and gently wipe off the dirt on your face with medicinal cotton (be careful not to get it in your eyes). After washing, wipe off the smell of alcohol with a towel. I usually wash my face with boric acid. It can prevent skin diseases, and it is especially beneficial to wash the eyes, mouth, and nose with boric acid water. Moreover, boric acid is very cheap, less than two cents per pound, which can be used for twenty days. Especially in the morning or before going to bed, washing the mouth with boric acid can prevent throat diseases and infectious diseases. It is cheap and good. You may want to try it.</p>

<p>Jiangxi People's Eyes Are Not Satisfied</p>
<p>Locals All Shout "It's Not Worth It"</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The long-awaited water sports meet initiated by the New Life Club was held today at 1 PM at the swimming pool outside the department. At the same time, the opening ceremony of the swimming pool was also held. People in Nanchang, shocked by the name of Yang Xiuqiong, even though the sun was scorching, the edge of the swimming pool was crowded with people, craning their necks and looking forward with great enthusiasm. The conference period is set for three days, and the ticket price is four dimes. Today is the first day. The reporter also bought a ticket to enter the venue this year, so I picked up some scenes and recorded them as left.</p>
<h3 id="e203">A Glimpse Inside and Outside the Venue <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>A shed platform is set up in the venue, divided into command platform, guest platform, news reporter platform, rescue platform, music platform, etc., connected from left to right. As for the men's and women's dressing rooms and the athletes' rooms, they are arranged in a corner under the platform. The river bank and the waterfront are for citizens to visit. The ticket office is located inside the first gate of the venue. The swimming pool is marked in a corner of the Gan River, about 50 meters from the shore. The diving platform is about 25 meters high and divided into three levels, also built in the water. Inside and outside the venue, there are social scouts, police, etc. to maintain order, military police to suppress, and many white cloth New Life slogans are hung, such as "Visitors, please walk one by one", etc.</p>

<p>The organizer did not have corresponding restrictions on guests in advance, so the temporary stage was occupied by wives and ladies. The command platform, the guest platform, and even the music platform, all turned into the sound of orioles and swallows, like a women's guest platform. Although the organizer later issued various warnings through the loudspeaker to ask them to leave the stage, it was ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Liu Xiangxiu First in Total Points in the Women's Group <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>

<p>The conference was originally scheduled to be held at 1 PM, so the audience gathered around 12 noon. It was postponed to 2 PM and had not yet started. Someone holding a loudspeaker standing on the highest level of the diving platform repeatedly shouted "Prepare to start the meeting now", but the meeting did not start until 2:30 PM for the third time. It is said that the New Life is new on land but not necessarily new on water.</p>

<p>The auditorium was originally set on the command platform, but because the platform was too crowded with guests, the platform could not bear the weight. At that time, the meeting was about to begin, and suddenly there was a loud noise, and there was a tendency to collapse. The mermaid was squeezed in the middle and was shocked. The auditorium was temporarily moved to the stage.</p>

<p>In the middle of the competition, Yang Zhijie's younger brother first performed driving backwards for 25 meters. At that time, his father also automatically joined the driving backwards outside the venue, like a father and son competing in doubles.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Shouting It's Not Worth It <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The reason why today's conference audience is so crowded is because of the call of the mermaid alone. If the local athletes compete, there is no excitement, which is in the intention. Unexpectedly, the Yang sisters' performances were only 50-meter prone swimming and breaststroke. Finally, only the mermaid alone performed 50-meter backstroke, which was very brief. When the announcer shouted "Ms. Yang's performance program is over today", the audience left the venue one after another. The local old timers, feeling that their eyes were not satisfied, shouted "It's not worth it" and left.</p>

It is said that if the association decides to participate in the World Games, it will first add the football team and women's swimming, because these two items are more promising.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Ministry of Education Reforms Four Shanxi Schools <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>National Normal, Sixth Normal, and Third Women's Normal Ordered to Become Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Law and Education Colleges Ordered to Merge into Shanxi University</p>
<p>(Taiyuan Correspondence) Recently, a restructuring plan has suddenly emerged in educational circles in Bingyuan. One aspect is the order from the Ministry of Education for the National Normal School in the provincial capital, the Sixth Normal School in Linfen, and the Third Women's Normal School in Daixian to be converted into vocational schools. The other aspect is the order for the Law College and the Education College in the provincial capital to be merged into Shanxi University. The Education Department has followed the Ministry's orders and is implementing these plans separately. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e219">Two Instructions from the Ministry of Education: (1) The expenses of Shanxi Normal Schools are excessively high, and the number of graduates exceeds the demand. Starting from the 23rd year, the National Normal School should cease enrollment and be converted into a vocational school. The nature of its departments should be based on local needs. (2) The number of classes and students at the Shanxi Provincial Sixth Normal School and the Third Women's Normal School are both scarce. Starting from the 23rd year, they should cease operations and be converted into vocational schools. Their existing students should be merged into other equivalent schools. After receiving the order, the Education Department immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Provincial Government for review and record. <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<h3 id="e220">Instructions from the Provincial Government <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government believes that since the Ministry of Education has issued an order, it should be followed. Moreover, the province is currently in a period of construction, and there is a shortage of talent in various industries. The existing vocational schools seem too few. In addition to finding ways to improve the existing vocational schools, a resolution was passed at a provincial government meeting instructing the Education Department to properly implement the Ministry of Education's instructions starting from the 23rd year.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Implementation by the Education Department <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the clear orders from the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government, the Education Department, in addition to drafting a general plan for the conversion and submitting it to the Ministry for approval, also separately notified the Sixth Normal School in Linfen, the Third Women's Normal School in Daixian, and the National Normal School in the city to implement the Ministry's orders. Furthermore, considering that the subjects and nature of vocational schools are crucial to the future of provincial construction, the Education Department specially requested the Provincial Government to forward a request to the Provincial Government Design Committee to review and determine the subjects to be offered by the National Normal, Sixth Normal, Third Women's Normal, and the First, Second, and Third Vocational Schools for this year based on local needs.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Committee Discusses Subjects <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the Education Department's document forwarded by the Provincial Government, Yan, the Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government Design Committee, immediately appointed Ji Zequan, the Director of the Education Department, Yu Ping, the Director of the Finance Department, Wang Qian, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Yang Sicheng, the Director of the Design Office, to jointly study the subjects to be taught in each vocational school and grade this year, in accordance with the curriculum standards for vocational schools promulgated by the Ministry and taking into account the needs of various localities in the city. Wang Ping was instructed to be responsible for convening the meeting. These officials have held several meetings at the Finance Department, and it is reported that a general decision has been made. After submitting it to Yan for approval, the Provincial Government will be instructed to forward it to the Education Department for implementation. The Education Department is currently actively planning the conversion.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Question of Merging the Law and Education Colleges <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Recently, rumors of merging the Law and Education Colleges into Shanxi University have been rampant. This reporter believes that this matter is of great importance to higher education in Shanxi and is eager to know the details. Therefore, this reporter visited President Feng Lun of the Law College at the Law College at around 8:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd). The reporter asked about the rumors of merging the Law and Education Colleges into Shanxi University, which have been circulating widely. Could you tell me about the progress? Feng smiled and replied to the reporter, "The Ministry of Education has long intended to merge the Law and Education Colleges into Shanxi University, but the specific merger plan has not yet been finalized. I don't know much about the situation at the Education College. I will only discuss the situation at our college. I am the president, and due to financial constraints, everything is very difficult. I am eager to resign and make way for someone more capable. I have previously submitted my resignation, but it has not been approved. In addition, my colleagues at the college are willing to reduce their salaries to maintain the college, so I have to reluctantly continue. However, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. I am very happy to hear about the merger. I have repeatedly discussed the matter with Director Ji and President Wang of Shanxi University, but no results have been obtained so far. However, it must be realized sooner or later. This matter will be further negotiated after Director Ji returns to Bing, otherwise, enrollment this year will still be a problem."</p>

<p>Responsible for Answering Three Points</p>
<p>(1) Student Employment Advisory Office Decided to Be Established</p>
<p>(2) Investigate the Number of Unemployed Graduates</p>
<p>(3) Consult with the Examination Yuan to Hold Examinations</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th Dispatch) Tan Poqian, the representative of the Vocational Movement in Beiping staying in Nanjing, was invited by Premier Wang to the Executive Yuan on the 30th. After Tan first stated his wishes, Wang replied, "I sympathize with the fact that university students are unable to find employment and have organized the Great Alliance of Vocational Movements. I am responsible for answering three points: (1) The National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Education established the National Student Employment Advisory Office last month, but it was suspended due to financial reasons. Now, regardless of whether there are funds, preparations will be made for its establishment next month. If the association cannot be established, the Executive Yuan will establish a National Student Employment Advisory Office to investigate the talent needs in various regions, so that talent can be used to its full potential. (2) Investigate the number of unemployed graduates from various universities and make an overall plan. (3) Consult with the Examination Yuan to hold examinations so that those with expertise will not have no opportunity to serve the country and society." His words were very sincere.</p>

<p>Excessive Costs Cannot Be Met</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th Dispatch) Gong Zizhi, the Director of the Yunnan Education Department, came to Nanjing and presented to the Ministry of Education a plan to establish a school in each of the more than thirty counties in Yunnan, according to the degree of need, with varying levels. The estimated cost is 10,000 yuan per month, or 120,000 yuan per year. Wang Shijie, the Minister of Education, said that the costs are excessive, and the government may not be able to allocate the full amount. If the funds were to be allocated from the Ministry of Education's original border education funds, these funds have not yet been received and cannot be used. Therefore, this matter will be discussed and another method will be devised.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Private Shanghai Mongolian and Tibetan School Approved for Registration <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th Dispatch) Prominent figures in Shanghai and disciples of the Panchen Lama established the Mongolian and Tibetan Academy in Shanghai and began enrolling students. Regarding the registration matters, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to investigate, and the facilities were found to be in compliance. Approval can be granted, but the name is not appropriate. The word "Academy" implies too large a scale and should be changed to "Private Shanghai Mongolian and Tibetan School". Minister Wang has approved this, and an order will be issued immediately.</p>

It is reported that in order to ensure that the postponement message is widely known, the association, in addition to publishing notices and notifying the relevant agencies for verification, also sent hundreds of copies of the recruitment brochure to the education bureaus of Fujian, Zhejiang, and the city, and issued a notice to all schools with summer military training.

<p>Expanding Facilities and Actively Striving Forward</p>
<p>Lisheng Elementary School, registered with the Municipal Education Bureau, was originally located on Rue Sapoce in the French Concession. It has always been known for its strict training, complete curriculum, and excellent reputation. Recently, due to the increasing number of students, the original location was difficult to develop. In order to facilitate students and develop school affairs, the school authorities recently relocated to a new building at 366 Rue Amiral Bayle (corner of Huanghe Road). The school building is spacious, with plenty of light and air, and has been completely arranged. Enrollment has begun. The teachers and staff employed by the school are all registered with the Municipal Education Bureau, qualified, and experienced in teaching. Therefore, the educational achievements are excellent. Graduates of each class who pursue further studies are always accepted, such as at Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School, Provincial Shanghai Middle School, and Private Zhengshi Middle School. Graduates of the school are always at the top of their class. From now on, the school will work harder and strive forward, focusing on the development of new life and physical education classes. It is also reported that in addition to all the old students continuing to enroll, children from Rue Amiral Bayle, Huanghe Road, Wangzhi Road, Avenue Paul Beau, and Route Doumer have been flocking to register and apply for admission in recent days.</p>

<p>Japanese schools have always attached importance to the situation in our country. Since the September 18th Incident, Chinese has been made one of the main foreign languages, and students have been sent to travel to various ports in our country. Recently, in addition to the students of the Chinese Language Department of Osaka, the Chinese Travel Group of Chiayi Middle School in Taiwan, a group of twenty-two people led by teacher Shiozaki Noboru of the school, arrived in Shanghai on the Changsha Maru of the Osaka Merchant Shipping Company.

<p>Since moving to the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Amiral Foch, the Shanghai Japanese Correspondence School has greatly expanded. Many more professors have also been hired to grade papers. Therefore, the homework done by the students is not accumulated. After receiving it, it is immediately corrected and returned. This has already been praised by the general student body. The pronunciation notes in the elementary class use three types of phonetic symbols so that people from all over the world do not have problems with pronunciation, which is the most difficult thing for beginners to read Japanese. The explanation of the grammar in the text is detailed, especially in other matters. Therefore, after completing the elementary class, it is possible to read ordinary Japanese books and newspapers. The advanced class studies literary works and advanced grammar. If the advanced class work can be completed, then any Japanese books and newspapers can be understood at a glance. It is reported that the school is constantly enrolling students, and detailed rules can be sent by mail upon request.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Financial News: Silver Prices and Exchange Rates Rise, Gold Falls by Four Yuan <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Spot Goods Arriving Amount to Approximately 10,000 Taels</p>
<p>Swap Discount Falls to One Yuan</p>
<p>After the gold market suddenly rallied at noon on Saturday of last week, the shorts seemed to waver. However, overseas silver markets rose, and yesterday's situation was difficult to sustain. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw increases in England and stability in the US. The Far East Gold Exchange was closed for forward silver prices. London raw gold remained unchanged, exchange rates rose slightly, US cotton rose seven points, and US wheat rose two and seven-eighths points. Public sentiment reversed, and initial bids for physical goods immediately fell to around 92 yuan. Preparatory transactions were made at 2.5 yuan and 3 yuan. The market situation after opening was relatively stable and could still rally. However, with bank demand exceeding supply, a decline was inevitable. The HSBC Bank announced its exchange rates for British and American currencies, which remained unchanged. At this time, the situation was most stable. Later, the exchange market was flat before rebounding. However, with differing sentiments and high-selling activity in the market, it soon faced setbacks again. Bank demand remained tight, and the gold market gradually softened. However, the situation was extremely stable, with no unexpected changes, and transactions were not large. The trend was mostly bullish. The afternoon market was flat. A telegram from Bombay reported a decline of one anna and a "do not move" message, indicating a slight rise. However, the trend remained weak, and large traders vigorously sold off, leading to a decline. However, with normal domestic bank trading and buyers still willing to participate, coupled with bargain hunters, gold prices were maintained, and the closing was relatively stable. The fluctuations throughout the day were narrow, with both rises and falls appearing weak, mainly due to limited trading. A large amount of Tianjin goods arrived, and Eastern goods also landed, totaling about 10,000 taels of spot goods. In addition, with the maturity of public bonds approaching, the swap discount fell back to one yuan. The price of fine gold was calculated at 1004 yuan and 3 jiao, with Tianjin goods priced at an additional 13.5 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 992 yuan and 8 jiao, down 3 yuan and 2 jiao from last Saturday. Physical goods opened at 3 yuan. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices: British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 0.09375, and American exchange at 33 yuan, 75 fen, and 8125 against the odds. Fuyu, Qingfa Yong, Dadecheng, Hengtai, Runchangyu, Zhaofengchang, Dingtai, and others submitted bids, rising to 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The British Bank offered US dollars for October at 34 yuan. Dafa Yong, Yifeng Yong, Yuqing Yong, and Yonglilai sold, reducing it to 2 yuan and 1 jiao. The exchange market was still flat. Hua Bi bought US dollars for August at 8125. Fuyu, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Dingtai, Yongde, Dachangxiang, Zhaofengchang, and others jointly submitted bids, gradually rising to 4 yuan. Shunli, Yongli, Dadecheng, Yuqing Yong, Yifeng Yong, and Fuxing Yong sold at high prices. Shanghai offered US dollars for November at 125, reducing it to 2 yuan and 7 jiao. HSBC Bank's listed prices remained unchanged. At this time, due to Yuqing Yong and Dingtai buying at low prices, the bank traded US dollars for September at 9375, once rising to 4 yuan and 2 jiao. However, the trend was extremely uncertain. With Fuyu, Yicheng, Hongli, and Hengyu providing bids, the bank offered US dollars for October at 34 yuan and November at 125, falling again to 2 yuan and 3 jiao. Fuyu, Tianfeng, Yuanchun, and Yongfeng submitted bids, rising to just over 3 yuan, but still struggling. Soon, Tianfeng bought strongly, rising to 3 yuan and 4 jiao. Zhaofengchang, scattered traders Dekang, Yiyu, and Qianchangxiang successively sold bids, retreating to 2 yuan and 2 jiao. Dafa Yong, Yuqing Yong, and Fuxing Yong still had a buying appetite, maintaining the price. The noon closing was 992 yuan and 4 jiao, with physical goods bid at 1 yuan and 8 jiao. After the market closed, Chengkang and Zhaofengchang supplied physical goods, slightly weakening the market.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 992 yuan, with physical goods opening at 1 yuan and 9 jiao. Fuxing Yong, Fuyu, and others bought. Bombay also fell one anna. It then rose from 1 yuan and 9 jiao to 2 yuan and 6 jiao. McCali sold US dollars for October at 34 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, and Chengkang vigorously sold, retreating to within 2 yuan. Dadecheng Donglai vigorously sold, retreating to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. Although Zhaofengchang and Fuxing Yong advanced to 1 yuan and 9 jiao, Dadecheng's selling pressure remained strong, falling again to 1 yuan. McCali submitted US dollars for November at 1875. Zhaofengchang, Tongfengheng, Fuxing Yong, Hengtai, and others jointly bought in, each reaching over 2 yuan. Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng were still selling, stabilizing the price. Finally, Tongfengheng still advanced, closing at 992 yuan, with physical goods bid at 2 yuan and 8 jiao. After the market closed, Yongli, Dingtai, Hengxingyuan, and Qingyu advanced, causing prices to rise. Checking the day's prices, the highest price was 994 yuan and 2 jiao, and the lowest price was 991 yuan, a fluctuation of 3 yuan and 2 jiao. As a result, the price fell back 4 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was due to HSBC Bank's listed US dollar exchange rate remaining unchanged at 33 yuan and 5 jiao, resulting in a gold price of 1032 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen, approximately 41 yuan weaker based on the closing price, a decrease of 4 yuan compared to last Saturday. August ledger entries were 996 yuan, and September entries were 992 yuan. The morning water supplement was 996 yuan. The price of fine gold was calculated at 1004 yuan, 9 jiao, and 3 fen, approximately 11 yuan and 5 jiao. Spot goods continued to arrive, nearly 10,000 taels. Swaps were even cheaper, and cash plus water became cheaper. Tianjin goods were priced at an additional 13 yuan and 5 jiao. Transactions were chaotic, with both local and out-of-town merchants participating. Generally, Yingfenghong bought 1,400 taels, in addition to covering short positions for August, at a total price of approximately an additional 12 yuan. On the swap side, due to the influx of spot goods and the approaching maturity of public bonds, the discount was even lower. Opening prices immediately saw Yingfenghong discount 1.5 yuan, which was offered by Yuanmaoyong, Huixiang, Yicheng, and Huiyuan, totaling over 300 entries. Yuanmaoyong discounted 105 entries to Qianchangxiang, retreating to 1 yuan and 3 jiao. Later, Yongfeng discounted at 1 yuan, while Shenkang discounted 5,006 entries to Tongyi at 1 yuan and 3 jiao. August ledger entries were particularly busy. Yuanheng transferred 35 entries to Yuanmaoyong, Dingtai transferred 140 entries to Fuxing Yong, Huixiang transferred 28 entries to Changshengyong, and so on, mainly because August was approaching. August entries totaled 17,276 entries, with seven long positions and twenty-three short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was light. In total, Tianfeng, Fuxing Yong, Hongxing, Dingchang, Yuqing Yong, Yingfenghong, Xianghe, Yuanshengyong, Futaiheng, Dachangxiang, Yicheng, Huixiang, Tongfengheng, Hengxing, and others were on the buying side.

<p>Many Covering Shorts and Turning Long</p>
<p>Soars One Yuan and Thirty-Four Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to Huang Fu's impending trip north and expected progress in North China diplomacy, the savings reserve was poised to be implemented. The market's share supply was bound to be insufficient, and there were whispers of a large long position organization with ample financial resources, potentially leading to a monopoly. Those with short positions saw the opportunity and either closed their positions early or turned long. Close to the financial sector, Nos. 5, 24, 46, and 53, etc., made daily purchases. Although Nos. 4, 16, 38, and 54, etc., were short, the market still felt a lack of shares, and the rising trend was strong. Only 96 remained listless, but it also improved slightly. The trend was feared to surge dramatically. The 80% rate on unified salt tax was imminent. Yesterday's developments saw a high opening, rising from 3-5 jiao to 6-7 jiao. Afterwards, the rising trend strengthened. In the second round, short position covering and long position turning gradually increased, and the rising trend became even stronger. The unified salt tax surged by 9.5 jiao, and the rest also rose by 3-5-7 jiao, etc. With stable environment and urgent need, the future cannot be underestimated. According to the market results, the good ones rose from 5-6 jiao to 1 yuan and 4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 21,700,200 yuan. The rising and falling results are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e244">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Shows Signs of Autumn Sales <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is good, as continuous procurement from the North Road continues, and business from other areas is also not bad, likely a precursor to the autumn sales season. As a result, public sentiment is better, but Japanese merchants still sell when prices rise, putting pressure on futures yarn. The overseas cotton industry is also stable. Regarding spot yarn, the market should see rising prices. The listed yarn market is closed for one day due to end-of-month settlement matters. Spot yarn purchases by merchants totaled over 1,000 bales. Prices are trending higher. Some transactions with the Tianjin gang have not yet been finalized and will not be included. These will be added tomorrow. The purchase amounts for each gang are listed below.</p>
<p>Tianjin 500, Guangdong 255, Shantou 25</p>
<p>North Gang 120, Jiangxi 10, Wuhu 15</p>
<p>Inland 140, Ningbo 5, Peers 25</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat, but the foreign cotton situation is still firm. However, the situation for new cotton production in this port is, according to some reports, good. Therefore, public sentiment is flat, and the market's need for spot cotton is calm. The futures cotton market is closed for one day due to end-of-month settlement matters. Spot cotton transactions are scarce.</p>

<p>The City Yarn and Cloth Exchange</p>
<p>Because the recent weather remains hot, from July 31 (Tuesday) to August 11 (Saturday), the afternoon auctions will be suspended, except for the normal morning meetings and transactions. All collections and payments should also be completed before 12:00 noon. This has already been announced in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e246">July Yarn and Cotton Settlement Volumes Not Huge <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yarn 58,000 Dan, Cotton 5,850 Bales</p>
<p>July's listed cotton was delayed until February 19 due to the National Government's revision of the catty system. The first session price was 36 yuan and 9 jiao, rising slightly to over 7 yuan. Later, due to the sluggish yarn market, the dull sales of raw cotton, and the flat Indian and American cotton markets, the lowest price was 33 yuan and 6 jiao. Afterwards, a certain cotton firm organized a long position company, and the pressure to squeeze the shorts was severe. With weak supply from all sources, they purchased large amounts and had strong control. Market prices rose sharply. At the same time, yarn prices trended higher, and the cotton market rose even more sharply. The highest price was 39 yuan and 6 jiao. However, the foreign cotton situation did not change much. Before long, a certain cotton merchant took the opportunity to profit and sold off large quantities, and market prices plummeted by over 1 yuan. Although there was a long period of hovering, the result was that the yarn mills declined, and most factories implemented reduced hours. The need for raw cotton decreased, and the Han and Huang gangs prepared to deliver large quantities, overwhelming the market. The lowest price was 25 yuan and 3 jiao. The result was a remainder of 58,000 dan, and the settlement price was 36 yuan. However, the actual delivery amount was only 2,500 dan. The goods, such as Tongzhou fire engine, Shaanxi Shashi, etc., were mostly delivered independently outside. The Han and Huang gangs were the majority of the delivering parties, and the receiving factories were not strong. Cotton merchants also had names. The brokers' names and the bale amount of the delivering and receiving parties are listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn: July's Jinji Listed Yarn was listed for auction on February 28 during the reform of the standard yarn. The first session price was 182 yuan, rising about 3 yuan. Later, due to disappointing spring sales and Japanese yarn being sold everywhere, it became more difficult for domestic yarn to gain a foothold. The lowest price fell within the 170 yuan mark. Then, in mid-April and May, during the old cotton era, the stored cotton was not thick, and there were rumors of cotton merchants controlling the market. Cotton prices rose step by step, causing yarn mills to gradually fall into difficulties. Some yarn mills, due to expensive cotton and cheap yarn, had difficult business operations and had to take the path of reducing and suspending work to maintain survival. Thus, work was reduced, stored yarn gradually decreased, and the price of rented yarn in the north was the cheapest for Chinese yarn. Therefore, the Tianjin gang came to Shanghai to purchase Chinese yarn in large quantities. Due to these two major reasons, public sentiment was agitated, triggering the activities of speculators. The market rose directly from 170 yuan, reaching a high of 185 yuan and 6 jiao. Extending to the recent period, due to Japanese merchants selling off, customer sales also stopped for a while. Also, the 30,000+ bale stocks in the warehouse still had no proper solution. In the final session, the 180 yuan mark was broken, and the price fell back to 178 yuan. The result was a remainder of 5,850 bales, and the settlement price was 179 yuan. The actual delivery was only 20 Jinzhong brand yarn and 300 bales. The receivers were mostly Ruida and financial circles engaged in arbitrage. The broker names and bale amounts of the delivering and receiving parties are listed below.</p>

<p>In June, the number of bales of cotton yarn manufactured by Japanese yarn mills in Shanghai and shipped to various destinations was 35,614, a decrease of 4,764 bales from the previous month. This was due to the decline in Grade 3 yarn and the unfavorable exchange rates for exports. The buying interest in the Japanese and overseas markets also shrunk considerably. The sales numbers for each port are listed below (Unit: Bales).</p>

<h3 id="e248">Frightening Rise in Grain and Flour Prices <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The flour market, after opening this morning, showed another relentless surge in prices for all months. Imported wheat was quoted at Chicago, up 90 cents to one dollar, and Canadian wheat up 50 to 60 cents. When the opening prices were announced, sentiment was already agitated, due to the urgent need for grain after the North Manchurian floods, coupled with rising prices for imported wheat. Unseasonal droughts and floods within the country, and recent nervous activity in Tianjin, all contributed to a worsening environment of demand exceeding supply. Concerns remain that the situation may further tighten. In the early trading, due to strong sales to the North, Tianjin, Dalian, Yingkou, and other northern regions showed brisk purchases, causing the market to jump by 4, 5, or 6 cents. At that time, major factories sold over 100,000 bags, but the surge barely subsided. In the second and third trading sessions, large players such as silver houses also offloaded 500,000 to 600,000 bags, seeming to calm the market slightly. However, as northern purchases remained strong, short sellers rushed to cover, causing market sentiment to rise again. With no major sellers continuing to offer, it was impossible to lower buying interest, and the market entered a surging phase. It is said that major players released over one million bags, but the market continued to soar, demonstrating the severity of the situation. Total daily trading reached 2.6 million bags, reportedly a recent record. As a result, this month's prices surged by 7.5 cents, August to October each rose by 8 cents, November rose by 7.75 cents, and December rose by 9 cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market, after opening this morning, showed a uniform surge in prices for all months. Imported wheat was quoted at Chicago, up 90 cents to one dollar, and Canadian wheat up 50 to 60 cents. At a time when sentiment was already favorable, the rise in imported wheat gave a further boost, and sentiment became even more frantic. Quotations from production areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were being snapped up by dealers and traders, and prices had already risen sharply. Around the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, prices had reached about $5.50 per bag, resulting in strong buying interest and a steadily rising market. However, the abundance of the wheat crop is generally acknowledged by both public and private sectors. The problem lies with the tight market, causing deliveries to be scattered and irregular. As a result, August rose by 6 cents, September rose by 8 cents, October and November each rose by 10 cents, and December rose by 12 cents. Current spot wheat prices have jumped 7 or 8 cents due to the surge in flour and wheat futures. Prices are: Nan-Suzhou, Wuhe, and Bengbu wheat at $3.48, Xuzhou and Shandong wheat at $3.50, Gaoyou and Daqiao wheat at $3.40, Mingguang wheat at $3.45-3.46, Huangqiao wheat at $3.43, Pukou wheat at $3.43, Yangzhou wheat at $3.24, down to $3.21. Fuxin sold 12,000 bags, and Xinda sold 6,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Government Loan of Wheat Should Be Made Public to Ease Flour and Wheat Fever <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>The flour and wheat market has now entered a frenzied state, defying reason. Initially, the price surge was triggered by drought in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, severely impacting the autumn harvest. Rice prices rose due to the weather, and the flour and wheat markets were shaken. Subsequently, when rain fell, the market seemed to ease. However, the North Manchurian floods raised concerns about the loss of autumn grain there, and grain from within the country had to supply the Northeast. Northern purchases thus became inevitable. In recent days, rumors have spread that the government is lending flour, which is about to be imported, priced at $2.55. It is said that 1.4 million bags are being shipped in August, with 400,000 bags each for Tianjin, Shanghai, and Xiamen, and the remaining 200,000 bags to be distributed elsewhere. At a time of tight market conditions, this large-scale aid provides some relief, and the government's concern for the people's suffering will become evident to the world. However, recent rumors in the market claim that this loan of flour has already been purchased in advance by powerful individuals. At a time of intense pressure and dire food shortages, this is utterly unreasonable. The severity of the current situation is no less than the extraordinary measures taken during the great flood of 1931. Fortunately, there is a global surplus, with the government lending flour and wheat, and manufacturers actively ordering imported wheat. The public, after difficulties, should not face widespread starvation. Now, the situation is different from the past. Foreign countries are experiencing famine, and China, which lacks statistics, has a wheat crop that should be more than sufficient to cope. However, manipulation by human desires is preventing the price surge from being stopped. If this batch of loan flour can be made public for relief purposes, then the trend will be like the stabilization of imported wheat prices, which immediately calms the market. This kind of relief is something that the authorities should consider.</p>
<h3 id="e250">River Rice Shows Weakness in Shanghai <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) The sources of supply for each region are similar to before, still only about seven or eight boats (approximately 1,200 to 1,300 *shi* of cargo). Since the market turned sluggish the day before yesterday, and now coinciding with the end of the month, sales have become even more stagnant. Local trading has stopped, and purchases from other regions have also completely ceased. The situation is quiet, and the market is showing weakness. Although common regional varieties such as Su-Tong and Nan-Gang *jeng* rice are able to hold steady due to their scarcity, late-season *qingjiao* and Song-Si rice prices have fallen by 10 to 20 cents due to limited inquiries. Du-Jian rice is also holding firm due to a lack of supply. Yang-Jian rice, on the other hand, is showing weakness, nearing 10 cents. Yin-Bian rice, due to a lack of supply and desirable taste, is showing unique strength. The general trend for new *jeng* rice remains similar, with prices opening at $12.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, another 80 *shi* or so of Dong-Xin new *jeng* rice arrived, and the taste was average, with prices remaining stable. About fourteen or fifteen boats arrived from the river regions, with sales of all varieties being average. The market price of white *jeng* rice is down slightly by about 10 cents, while thin rice is holding steady. The price of white *yuan* rice is up slightly. The remaining varieties are showing a peaceful trend.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Imported *Xian* Rice Sells Well to Inland Regions <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, prices rose by 20 cents... over 10,000 bags were opened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for imported *xian* rice was again briskly purchased by inland regions, and the market trended towards tightening again. Furthermore, the inventory of old imported rice has been decreasing daily, causing囤积者(ton jī zhě) to hold firm. Demand is strong both locally and inland. Newly ordered Saigon rice has not yet arrived in Shanghai. The earliest arrivals will be in about a week, or earlier for those who ordered earlier. Therefore, the market and sentiment are both hopeful. In Hunan, rice production varies from place to place. Shipments from inland are still arriving continuously. Unpolished rice transferred from Hankou and Shashi is also arriving in a steady stream. However, yesterday, inland appetite was very strong, and all newly arrived rice was sold. Therefore, the market is quite tight, and prices have jumped from 10 cents to as much as 20 cents. A total of 2,000 bags were opened in the Shanghai market and distributed between local and inland buyers. It is said that 8,230 bags of *xian* rice from various regions were all purchased by inland buyers.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Oil Market; Oil Market Brisk, Bean Market Firm Too <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The bean oil and peanut oil market is quite brisk, and production prices are rising daily. Local stocks are not high, and distribution to various rural areas continues actively. Yesterday, over 1,500 items of various oils were transacted (for prices, please see the market price column). The soybean market remains firm, with factory sales continuing. Transactions involved eight or nine carloads of various beans, and 300 bags of Hankou beans. Local purchases involved three carloads of various beans. High-quality goods are holding firm. New Jiujiang Chengmeng beans arrived and were sold out, with market prices unchanged. Over 800 bags were transacted, mainly purchased by Ningbo and local buyers. 200 bags of new Hankou green flour were opened at a price of $2.75, split between Ningbo and local buyers. Sales of these beans are sluggish, and the market appears weak. The second batch of new Jiujiang Jiangqiao beans was opened yesterday, but sales were not good, and prices were reduced to $3.30.</p>

<p>The initial price of fresh Hunan lotus seeds in Hankou was around $39, but it has since fallen. The current market price is $30, a drop of about $9. The opening price was $34-$35. Ningbo merchants are showing a purchase trend. Temporarily set. The current value of white lotus seeds has been affected by the gap between old and new supplies. The market price remains firm and high.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Sugar Market; Raw Sugar and White Sugar Rise Slightly with Customs Gold <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rebound in customs gold after weakening, reaching a low of 1.998 and closing at 2.005, hence the firm and stable trend. The guild set price of $20 for spot 24 raw sugar and white sugar has not been achieved in recent days. Yesterday, it was sold at $19.97. Goods from this shop were sold at $20.10 to $20.05. Coarse grains were sold at $20.15 to $20.13, all up 5 cents. High Dutch red sugar was sold at $15.50, and ordinary No. 8 or 9 was sold at $15.30, both up 10 cents. Taikoo A grade rose 5 cents to $20.45. Wood factory cotton white No. 1 remained unchanged at $19. A number of Chaoqing packages were opened, with special grades at $14 and standard grades at $13.78. The same as refined sugar, with over a hundred packages continuing to be opened. Xingbai was sold at $17.80, Xingchi at $14, and Xinghuaqing at $12.20, all with little change.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Silk and Tea; Overseas Silk Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Waste Silk Sales to Germany Halted. Wild silk cocoons and waste materials produced in provinces such as Sichuan and Hubei, including *ti hu*, *wan hu*, *jin zi*, and *xian wei ba* (generally referred to as waste silk by customs), were traditionally sold to Germany. Foreign firms in Shanghai such as Friedemer and Meishishi shipped several hundred pieces to German territories each month. Affected by the Austrian political upheaval, German silk exports have become sluggish, and waste silk shipments to Germany have completely stopped. Recently, two German mail ships, Rheinland and others, have departed without any waste silk bound for German territories.</p>
<p>New Sichuan and Hubei Silk Shipments to Shanghai Scarce. Factory silk and coarse silk produced in Sichuan and Hubei provinces were popular among foreign merchants. Recently, due to repeated declines in overseas silk prices, the cost of new Sichuan and Hubei silk is not low, and European merchants in Shanghai are offering extremely low prices, making sales difficult. Therefore, shipments to Shanghai are scarce. Since the beginning of summer, imports by river steamers have been very limited. New Sichuan and Hubei silk shipments to Shanghai are limited to small postal packages of yellow factory silk delivered by the postal service daily.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Sales Stagnant. In overseas markets, silk factories remain sluggish, and the price decline has not stopped. Morning telegrams of Shanghai silk being auctioned off to European and American markets were not seen yesterday. European merchants and silk shops are still suppressing prices and purchasing cautiously, while Chinese silk merchants are finding it difficult to sell and are preparing to suspend operations and wait for an opportune time. The market is quiet, with no transactions reported.</p>
<p>Rayon Prices Firm and High. Rayon sales are weak, but market prices are quite firm and high. This is because the stock of Italian goods in warehouses is quite scarce. Second-grade 120 denier re-exported rayon is selling for $365 per case (up $5). Second-grade 50 denier rayon is selling for $382 per case (up $2). Local silk factories purchased over ten cases each. Prices for other goods are also firm, with no fluctuations. Transactions are sporadic. Since the large-scale import of Japanese goods, sales have not been strong. 120 and 150 denier goods have followed Italian goods and are extremely firm.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Brisk Transactions of Select Top-Grade Tea <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign tea merchants in Shanghai actively sought out select top-grade green tea from tea estates. British firms such as Jinlong, Tongfu, and Yihua were all actively purchasing, and transactions were unusually brisk. However, the opening market price for the top grade was $160, and the price for the second grade was $130, down $6-7 to $10 compared to the previous. Sales of ordinary wholesale tea remain sluggish. Transactions in *zhen mei*, *gong xi*, and other items are declining. The overall trend is difficult to see as positive. In addition, although foreign firms have sent out sporadic telegrams for Qi-Men and Hunan black tea, there have been very few replies. The situation is also not as good as before.</p>

<h3 id="e257">This is a Question of History <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Amidst the clamor of inheriting literary heritage, some people advocate "learning techniques." They say that we can't learn anything from China's past literature, and we must learn from foreign works. Our eyes should look outward.</p>
<p>This argument is generally correct. However, in reality, it's not a question of looking inward or outward. We should focus on the historical development of literature. Admittedly, Chinese literature is lagging behind. But this assertion holds true only when limiting the issue to a specific historical stage.</p>
<p>Chinese literature lags behind foreign literature only in terms of modern urban literature. Moreover, this isn't due to differences in ethnicity or nation, but mainly because China lacks modern capitalism.</p>
<p>If we seek profit from modern urban literature, we won't find much in China's past literary works. This is a fact. And the benefits that modern urban society's literature provides us are more numerous and undeniable. This isn't a question of China versus foreign countries, but a question of world history.</p>
<p>If we want to learn creative methods from modern writers, we should naturally study European and American authors like Barbusse, Gide, Gorky, Wassermann, and others, instead of blindly imitating Zhang Tianyi or other writers. Everyone knows that imitating Zhang Tianyi won't lead anywhere. This is a very clear issue in literary history, because our current society is backward.</p>
<p>However, the so-called literary heritage doesn't only refer to the literature of modern urban society. Homer's two great epics are heritage, and primitive ballads are also heritage. If Boileau's poems are heritage, then Du Fu's poems are certainly also heritage. The techniques of "Water Margin" aren't necessarily inferior to "Comic Novel" or "Gil Blas." Moreover, there are many pre-modern urban society and pre-Industrial Revolution Western European literary works that can provide us with literary creative methods. And, in my personal experience, Du Fu has indeed given me many benefits. The Japanese poet Kitagawa Fuyuhiko has also said that he received many instructions from Du Fu.</p>
<p>"Learning techniques" isn't imitating techniques. Conducting precise research on past literary works, gaining proper understanding, and thereby acquiring new techniques and new creative methods, is the issue of inheriting literary heritage. The main point is to develop old techniques. Copying-style learning may be harmful. In that case, one might narrow down the literary heritage to the smallest scope, until finally someone denies the literary heritage altogether. This contains a great danger.</p>
<p>The most important thing is a proper understanding of the world and life. With a correct historical understanding, any literary heritage can be inherited. New techniques can be invented from any kind of work. Baudelaire and the symbolist poets of the fin de siècle all provide us with good nourishment. The poems of Wang Wei and Du Mu are naturally the same. The main point lies in the issue of our understanding and development.</p>
<p>It's the establishment of creative methods or the acquisition of techniques, not copying-style learning techniques. It's a question of history, not a question of China versus foreign countries. Gaining new techniques from the study of old works is the key point. Naturally, advocating learning from Du Fu doesn't mean writing old-style poetry. Just as learning from Zola doesn't require writing in French.</p>
<p>Some people learn from translated works of Gorky, but due to the translations, they only learn some new vocabulary without gaining Gorky's true spirit. This isn't learning techniques, but merely slavish imitation.</p>
<p>What we need to pay attention to is how to inherit literary heritage. This is a question of history.</p>
<h3 id="e258">The Art of Calling <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xi, from Beijing</p>
<p>I happened to walk past Xinjiekou. I saw watermelons stacked like pyramids on the watermelon stalls. The vendors, fanning away flies with palm-leaf fans, stretched their throats and shouted, "Big juicy watermelons, have a bite!" The sound was like a magnet; whether you wanted to eat or not, you couldn't help but look at the watermelon stall. This made me think of the art of calling.</p>
<p>The word "bite" is very forceful. When you hear the word "bite", you're likely to think of cooling off after a ten-mile walk with a watermelon. Watermelons are so full of moisture, especially the juicy ones, that they almost drip when you bite into them. If you're not careful, the soft, crisp flesh might break off and fall. So you have to eat them quickly, biting hard and without hesitation. Afterwards, you wipe your hands and mouth, take a deep breath, and say, "Ah!" This scene is perfectly captured by the word "bite".</p>
<p>If I were to change "bite" to "eat", it wouldn't be so exciting. Logically, it would be too generic. It's like how saying "boat" makes people feel vague, whereas saying "fishing boat" or "steamboat" is more specific. Saying "steamboat" makes people think of waves and speed, while saying "fishing boat" makes people think of wind and sails. Just saying "boat" seems to require looking up and down. The brilliance of Wang Zhihuan's poem, "The white sun sinks behind the mountains, the Yellow River flows into the sea, to see a thousand miles further, climb another story," lies entirely in the word "story." The first three lines are no different from telling you that a thousand miles of scenery are still ahead. This half-spoken, half-swallowed way of speaking really makes you feel uncomfortable. When he says "story," that's when you can breathe a sigh of relief. This is because "story" is a level tone. Just as you are climbing, your wish is still in "to want." Only when you reach the top does it become level, comfortable, and you can see a thousand miles: see the Yellow River flowing into the sea, see distant mountains, see the white sun, see smoke, see mist, front and back. The earth is simply a big circle. That's enough flatness. With the word "story," the preceding and following text are not wasted. What if "story" were changed to "tower"? That would be terrible! Not only would the Yellow River not "flow," but it would be as if, just as you were breathing, you would have your heart broken the moment you inhaled, and you would never be able to catch your breath, just like a lifeless tower. The reason why the word "bite" is so forceful can probably be found in this line of reasoning.</p>
<p>This is what I thought of from "biting" watermelon. Speaking more broadly, based on the cities I've walked through, the peddlers of Beijing must be the champions of the art of calling. The purpose of calling is simply to advertise, but this kind of advertising has an immediate goal to be achieved; delaying it will lead to starvation. Therefore, being loud is the first requirement. On this point, the peddlers of Beijing undoubtedly occupy the top spot. Look at them tilting their heads and half-stroking the roots of their ears. Their voices can simply jump over the eaves and go straight into people's courtyards. In the alley where I live, there are two loud voices that resonate there every evening, one is "Fried tofu opening the pot", and the other is "Wonton opening the pot." There are also two in the morning, one is soymilk, and the other is almond tea. I'm curious, whenever they happen to be "opening the pot," they always put "opening the pot" at the end; moreover, those two words are always stretched out and vibrated so much that it really sounds like there's a pot in front of you bitterly "opening" like that. I think the beauty probably lies in the word "pot." When the word "pot" is pronounced, the lips are initially pursed so long, and then they are pulled back with a little aftertaste; therefore, it makes me think of a covered pot: opening it is so bitter and continuous, and when you lift the lid, it's like the tide receding, and the sound is louder and farther; this is exactly like retracting the lips. Therefore, the words "opening the pot" mean that the water is boiling, and at the same time they describe the scene of the pot lid being lifted; how tempting this is! The art of calling is like this.</p>
<p>Those who sell melons do not say the melon is bitter. Advertising always involves exaggeration, and the peddlers also know this; for example, "Big dates!" or "A big bowl for a dime!" When children hear this kind of calling, they will simply jump around their mothers. In reality, a dime is only seven or eight, far from being a big bowl. But thinking about it carefully, those three "big" characters are really shouted quite wonderfully. There are also exaggerations that are both vivid and lifelike, such as comparing radishes to pears, and persimmons to squashes. When the autumn wind brings sand and soil, big, red, and shiny persimmons can be seen everywhere in the markets of Beijing. They are certainly big enough, but compared to squashes, it's no wonder that old women would say, "How big are squashes - nonsense!" However, the persimmon vendors always shout in unison, "Squash-sized persimmons, it's okay to bite into them even if they're astringent!" These few words really describe a persimmon well enough; it's not just big, but not astringent, which is not easy to find. On winter nights, along with "hard noodles," what poets praise is the sad tune of "radish better than pears; spicy, can exchange."</p>

<p>Yes, the work of drawing water is the most important thing right now. The fields now don't need plowing, they only need "water!"</p>
<p>"Ah," the son replied, proposing another idea, "Let's not go to the fields during the day tomorrow either. Let's draw water."</p>
<p>Having said that, he quickened his pace. The father didn't answer him, he was pondering his son's suggestion.</p>
<p>Arrived home.</p>
<p>Meals for a family of three were originally very simple, but in recent days they have been especially simple - no, it should be said they have been compressed. Compressed to the point that besides rice mixed with bran, there was only a bowl of pickled vegetable soup for each meal. Even so, Wang Axing didn't think it was enough, he even wished the family didn't eat a single grain of rice. He expected that after a prolonged drought, there would definitely be a poor harvest, and rice prices would definitely skyrocket. To prepare for the future, they should save now. However, no matter how much they save and reduce, people can't live without eating. He felt a pang of pain in his heart as he watched his son wolf down his food at the table.</p>
<p>It's not like his son wanted to eat more, it was simply that he needed to replenish himself after a day's labor.</p>
<p>"Ah Da, I think you can eat more than before."</p>
<p>Wang Axing's words hovered on his lips several times, before he finally said it painfully. Was it that he didn't love his son? No. But he was also afraid of a poor harvest at the end of the year, he was afraid of the unfortunate outcome, so he couldn't help but say such harsh words.</p>
<p>The son stared fixedly at his father's face, without replying, only calling out "Father." Although it was just one word, it contained a hidden pain that he couldn't express. The mother spoke up for her son, saying angrily:</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to let him eat his fill? How can he have the strength if he doesn't eat his fill! How can he work in the fields without strength? How can he draw water?"</p>
<p>After eating, the sun had already set behind the treetops in the west. Wang Axing didn't rest, and even forgot to smoke his usual pipe of tobacco after the meal. He urged his son to leave the house together.</p>

<p>The dog sticks out his tongue and has no strength to bark. There is not a single sound in the bamboo forest. You can't find a single bird up or down the mountain, and you can't hear a single insect chirping to the left or right of the lake. An old man is dozing off in the field, a fishing rod for catching shrimp has slipped into the lake, the inside of the white sail is all dreams, and there are people sleeping in the thatched pavilion. I'm running wildly in this landscape because I'm looking for signs of vitality and joy, but everywhere there's tiredness and sorrow, and I'm really puzzled. So I sing foolishly by the lake, hoping for rain to break the stillness. When laughter ripples on the lake, I want to jump into that joyful lake.</p>

<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, this "Happy Land of the Pacific" was not yet known to the world. Originally, it was a kingdom. The kingdom has been annexed into the United States for over three thousand years. Now, the bronze statue of the former monarch of Hawaii still stands tall in the harbor, worshiped by the local people. The races on the island are very complex, with yellow, white, brown, and tan skin tones, creating a mixed picture of East and West. Among the population of 360,000, Japanese people account for 140,000, almost three out of every eight Hawaiian residents are Japanese. In terms of Asians, there are also 60,000 Filipinos, 30,000 Chinese, and 3,000 Koreans. In terms of Europeans, there are 30,000 Portuguese, and about 40,000 British, American, German, and Russian people. As for pure Hawaiians, there were originally as many as 200,000, but now only 20,000 remain. The mixed race of Hawaiians and Europeans is about 15,000; the mixed race with Asians is about 12,000. Judging from the above figures, the complexity of the Hawaiian race is enough to arouse the interest of curious people.</p>
<p>When the ship stops at the harbor, you can smell a unique fragrance of Hawaiian plants. Local girls with yellowish-black skin, their jet-black hair scattered, swim in front of the beach with their strong and beautiful limbs. The sea is emerald green, and the sun shines on the beach, reflecting color circles like peacock tails. After seven o'clock in the evening, the slight sea breeze gently and coolly caresses the entire harbor. The best time of day in Hawaii then begins. On the mountains and hills, electric lights shine like stars in the dark night. At this time, I hired a car and drove around the island. The roads in Hawaii are very exquisitely built, and the low huts along the road are mostly shops opened by Japanese people. Many young girls, wearing cicada-wing-like thin silk clothes, stroll east, west, north, and south on the streets. Those with round faces are Japanese. Those with black arms are Hawaiians. Those wearing split cheongsams are Cantonese. Those who are tall and big with their chests out are Americans. They are all very leisurely and content. Especially the small-bodied Chinese and Japanese, as light as swallows, swimming back and forth like small crucian carp, enjoying the cool breeze of the clear night and the unique tranquil air under the coconut trees.</p>
<p>The beaches of Hawaii are the most famous swimming locations in the world. It's a pity that I came too late and could only walk a few steps on the beach, bringing many fine grains of white sand into my shoes. The small shops by the beach are brightly lit, and many young men and women are having a wild time drinking there. Several miles away, there is also a "Hawaiian Village," which is an open-air dance floor, with all the decorations in the original style of the natives. The village is surrounded by very tall coconut trees, with coconut oil lamps lit under the trees. Many eight or nine-year-old Hawaiian children, naked and draped in red cloth, serve as hosts. There are four or five dancing girls in the village, mostly Hawaiian. They are wearing skirts made of grass and dancing the local dance with soft limbs. The songs they sing are melodious and graceful, sometimes with a few English words inserted in the songs. Those dancing are probably guests from the ship. Americans like novelty the most, so most of the people dancing and laughing under the coconut trees are visitors who are used to seeing dancing in New York.</p>

<h3 id="e263">Lunar Eclipse <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the Astronomical Institute of the Central Research Institute in Nanjing, there will be a "lunar eclipse" on the 26th of this month. It is found that the 26th is exactly the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the abandoned calendar, commonly known as the Mid-Month, and the people have already been preparing for the celebration ceremony on that day before the news comes.</p>
<p>"Lunar eclipse" is commonly known as "eating the moon," so the ancient Chinese creators of characters also knew that there would be "lunar eclipse" events in the future, and they had already planned for our grandchildren, combining "eat insect" into one word to describe this matter. The ordinary lower-class people have deeply imprinted in their minds that there will be a "black moon eating the white moon" once a year. They do not know the history of "lunar eclipse" or "no lunar eclipse," they only know that the elderly told them that this "moon eating moon" is very terrifying. If the "white moon" is eaten by the "black moon" and does not come out, the world will be destroyed immediately.... Therefore, they want to fast and celebrate, set off firecrackers, and beat gongs to scare away this "black moon." If they cannot scare it away, then it will be terrible, and the society will immediately be in chaos, and there will be no peaceful days in the world!... This unscientific understanding of theirs truly represents the semi-feudal, semi-colonial China that is indirectly ruled by the economic aggression of imperial capitalism, completely exposing the illegal organization of this current society.</p>
<p>On the "lunar eclipse day," the people in various places enthusiastically beat gongs and set off firecrackers, and the situation was urgent, as serious as when the news of General Shirakawa's death in the January 28th Incident spread. A sense of urgency! The air was filled in the streets of Shanghai, from about 7 pm to about 9 pm, this middle two hours was an extremely serious period. Fortunately, the people's wishes were fulfilled, and the white moon was not eaten by the black moon; otherwise, the world would not know what it would be like. At the same time, it can be said that the power of gongs and drums and firecrackers is enough to scare away the "black moon," just like "the living Buddha Zhang Tianshi set up an altar to pray for rain, and he always granted him a few times, showing their magic power..."</p>
<p>The entire Chinese social economy is under the serious invasion of capital imperialism today, and the wave of rural economic bankruptcy has begun to spread to cities, but under this condition, the people still have no awareness. The declining class and petty bourgeoisie who cannot get enough to eat at ordinary times feel infinite excitement on the "lunar eclipse day," just like in the amusement parks such as the Great World Tianyun Tower, they would rather suffer themselves and use the money to celebrate, anesthetizing themselves and thinking it is a meaningful night, but on the other hand, it also makes a timely business for firecracker and fast merchants, increasing their personal pockets, which is also a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Starting from the Students Becoming Robbers <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>The other day, the newspaper reported that on Triumph Road in western Shanghai, a Western woman was robbed by four robbers. Later, a patrolman arrested one of the robbers, who confessed that the four who committed the robbery had always been students. This fact is not surprising in Shanghai society. I think most people who read the newspaper will just glance over it and not pay much attention to it, unlike low-level news such as adultery, which is enough to attract attention. This is also due to the special environment of Shanghai people. When glancing over it, they will not go to explore its cause and effect, which is of course also expected.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of more serious people, they feel that this is not only worthy of our attention, but also worthy of our thorough understanding and research of people's minds.</p>
<p>China has been running new education for decades, and now, many people are shouting "education bankruptcy." The performance of this kind of student robbery is not the first time, it is truly raising the flag of this bankruptcy phenomenon, painfully imprinted in our eyes.</p>
<p>No matter how much education is carried out, and no matter how many schools increase year by year, it is nothing more than creating a large group of high-level vagrants. What is the reason for this? The crux is as follows: (1) Regarding education as an independent undertaking, only running education for the sake of education, without paying attention to the relationship between education and society, so creating a deformed phenomenon. (2) Regarding education as an opportunity for "personal gain," regardless of the purpose of education, regardless of the way out for education. (3) Due to the second point, most people engaged in education are running to the cities, loving to run education in the cities, and unwilling to go to the vast rural areas to run education.</p>
<p>In the vast rural areas, groups of basic citizens, some are very fortunate to recite a few sentences of "white-eyed text" in front of pedantic scholars, such as the Three Character Classic, but in reality, they are still blind and illiterate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, where are batches of middle school and university graduates going? There is no way to place them in society, they cannot be placed.</p>
<p>Some middle school students, whose parents have a warm heart, and they themselves hold a great hope, come out of the back door of middle school and quickly step on the front steps of university. This kind of student can be regarded as a happy child, but I don't know what percentage they account for.</p>
<p>However, after graduating from university, there is only a dead end to go, that is absolutely true. However, who dares and who is willing to go to a dead end? So the fact is unfolding like this:</p>
<p>A very small number, because they rely on the thick shade of their ancestors, turn to foreign countries to study, these are the darlings of heaven, how many can there be? Secondly, they can only go back to their hometown to eat old rice, hug the thighs of yellow-faced wives, feed their children, and play with small walnuts. I have several friends who have graduated from university who are like this. Another large group, with a rather ashamed mentality, feel that they have graduated from university but have no way out, and saying to go home to eat old rice is really better to starve to death in the city. However, can they really go to starve to death? Then they cannot, so tricks come out, and they risk trying everything dangerous.</p>
<p>Becoming a robber is just one of them. Please try to open your eyes and see how many sinful things in society are done by students who have always studied. The question is so serious, how to solve it, who is responsible for this?</p>

<p>— Nai Ling</p>
<p>The Japanese writer Hakuson Kurakawa once said in his book "Impressions of Traveling in America": "When entering the dining room, the woman runs in front, and the man follows respectfully behind, this is an American couple; the woman follows the man, talking and laughing while holding hands, this is a French couple; the man sticks out his chest and belly and runs in front, and the woman follows behind him, this is an English couple." (The general idea is like this) The reason why Hakuson Kurakawa cited this example, judging from his meaning, is roughly to praise American men for "respecting women," and the men of other countries cannot keep up with them, so Hakuson Kurakawa also affirmed: "America is the golden country of women!"</p>
<p>Since the European wind blew into our ancient country</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>, the matter of "respecting women" seems to have been noticed by us, but it is only noticed, and in terms of implementation, because of the uneven level of knowledge of the general people. Therefore, it cannot achieve universal effect; for example, we often see on the tram that women stretch out their short hands to hold the rattan ring, and men sit comfortably in their seats. Although this matter is small, it is enough to show that the general public has not yet understood what "respecting women" is all about.</p>
<p>Tonight, after finishing work, when I ran to the road, I saw a young couple arguing by the roadside. The man was wearing a very fashionable Western suit, and the woman looked like a well-educated woman. They were just arguing at first, but when they reached the climax, they started fighting; as a result, the woman could not beat the man, and the man just punched the woman one punch after another. At this time, among the people who gathered to watch the excitement, there was a vigorous young man who stood up, not only to rescue the woman, but also punched the man one punch after another. The person who was arguing with the woman earlier was obviously weaker and had to retreat to the foot of the wall, shouting:</p>
<p>"We are family, mind your own business!"</p>
<p>The vigorous young man answered cleverly: "Regardless of whether you are family or not, if you beat a woman outside, we will beat you; since you are family, why don't you go home to reason, why fight in the street?"</p>
<p>It was the woman who ran out to mediate, and the matter was concluded!</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this matter? Why do I want to bring it up? Nothing else, this also shows that there are still some people who understand respecting women.</p>
<p>"Respect women," some people must still oppose, they will say this: "Why respect women? Isn't it good for everyone to be equal? We don't want to oppress women like before!" However, these people have forgotten the characteristics of women: because they are physically and physically, after scholars have proven, they are far inferior to men; therefore, men, not only like Yi Fangshuo, had a wife and three concubines and wanted to marry a thirteen-year-old girl as the fourth concubine, we must strongly oppose, even letting a woman stand in a bumpy tram, and the man sits comfortably, we must also oppose! The former is to make the status of men and women equal, and the latter clearly contains the meaning of "respecting women"!</p>
<p>Although men should "respect women" everywhere, women should not think that they have gained the respect of men, and show arrogance and look down on everything!</p>
<h3 id="e267">Countryside and City <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>People who live in noisy and bustling big cities but cannot enjoy the blessings of urban civilization always yearn for a secluded and quiet rural life. In their minds, they often think: in spring, the fields are full of colorful flowers, and the streams and valleys are full of clear flowing water, lovely; in summer, everywhere is lush green jungle, chirping and singing cicadas, lovely; and in the late autumn with fallen leaves all over the ground, and the bleak winter with white snow all over the mountains and fields, the desolate and solemn scenery is also lovely. If it is a poet, as long as he walks there for a few days, he can bring back many soul-stirring poems, if it is an essayist, as long as he sits in the east wing and looks out at the fields on both sides, he can also write many fascinating sketches! (Many travel notes and sketches are written in this way).</p>
<p>However, is the countryside really as beautiful as people imagine in their minds and as depicted in the poet's pen? This may only be sitting in a sedan chair, listening to the creaking sound of the waterwheel, and busily chanting "the gentle breeze sends the sound of the waterwheel," such a touching line; like Lu Xun wrote in "Storm in a Teacup," sitting on a wine boat, looking out and seeing the villagers chatting while shaking large plantain fans, he immediately burst into poetic inspiration, saying: "Without thought and without worry, this is truly the joy of a farmer's family"! This kind of superficial observation! As for what Old Lady Nine Pounds said, they cannot hear it, and the situation that farmers are busy all year round and still cannot live a good life, they have not seen it—or are unwilling to see it.</p>
<p>"Revitalize the countryside," "Go to the countryside,"... these slogans were once shouted very loudly some time ago: but this is just everyone shouting when they are happy, and I have never seen anyone actually do it; even now, they feel tired and tasteless even shouting, and gradually become silent!—Perhaps the rise and fall of the countryside has little to do with these people who sleep in the city and praise the countryside!</p>
<p>Now, travel notes depicting the countryside as a paradise, and poems depicting the life of farmers as so leisurely and comfortable, can be seen everywhere again; this cannot help but admire the strong imagination of these artists!</p>
<h3 id="e268">Grandma Class Theory <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Sheng</p>
<p>Among women, the grandma class is the most useless. Living expenses are earned by the husband; brewing tea and cooking rice, sweeping the floor, wiping the table, washing clothes, and folding quilts, all have to be done by the old maids; buying boat tickets to cross the river, and buying tickets to go to the cinema, all have to be done by younger siblings.... In short, except for eating and playing mahjong, where one has to use both jade hands, the rest of the time, it is best to lie on a rocking chair and ask the maids to rub their legs for comfort.</p>
<p>The predecessors of grandmas, some are old-fashioned young ladies, some are new-style female students, and some are modern socialites. However, the old-fashioned young ladies can do needlework, the new-style female students can play table tennis and knit foreign rope clothes, and the modern socialites can shake hands, which can be said to be not entirely useless; only after becoming a grandma class, they are afraid of being shy when shaking hands, they are impatient to do needlework and knit clothes, and they have no strength to play table tennis. In a word, after a woman becomes a grandma, she simply becomes a useless waste.</p>
<p>Grandma Pitiful Theory</p>
<p>However, grandmas are also the most pitiful among women.</p>
<p>Young girls can jump around, and old women can laugh happily; but grandmas cannot.</p>
<p>The grandma class itself has no happiness, and takes the happiness of the husband class as its happiness. The husbands in the world cannot all have happiness: and some of the husband's happiness must be shared with parents, some must be shared with children, some must be shared with friends, and even some must be shared with enemies. Therefore, in terms of the entire grandma class, there is really no happiness at all.</p>
<p>When the old maid feels tired of working and is unhappy, she can immediately find a new one, and if the maid is wronged, she can also run away privately. However, the fate of the grandma class is doomed: a new environment is not easy to find, run away? Where is the courage? So the suffering of the grandma class must be endured for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Grandma Sinful Theory</p>
<p>In fact, the grandma class is a class that commits sins and does evil.</p>
<p>People belonging to the husband class, except for a very few, mostly have "serious business" to do in society: if society loses the activities of men, then this society will die immediately. However, the grandma class is unwilling to take into account this overall situation. They do not care about three or seven twenty-one, and always hope to hug their husbands in their arms and treat them as their hearts and livers, and they think they are happy. They only know how to enrich their own small world, and do not know that outside their small world, there is a big world.</p>
<p>Napoleon said: "Women are machines for bearing sons"! But many grandmas are too ignorant, and their environment does not allow them to raise sons, but she actually gives birth to sons, and even gives birth to as many as possible one after another. This will affect the husband's career and increase the burden of living. Many men in society commit crimes because they have to support their families. This account cannot but be placed on the grandma class.</p>
<p>However, if the grandma class does not give birth to sons at all, then the number will inevitably be extinct: so not giving birth to sons is also a sin.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Ghosts in the Swimming Pool <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Ping</p>
<p>It is said that in the swimming pool of the Central Military Academy in Nanjing, "recently, there have been cries at night, and the water waves are also quite loud." It is said that "a student of the ninth term drowned in the swimming pool some time ago." So "whether the above news is caused by this," although "it is impossible to know"; but based on the fact that "when the weather was hot last time, students or service soldiers often sneaked to the pool to snore and cool off at night, but no one has gone recently," it is really a miracle of "something happened for a reason" and "found to have factual basis," "which is really worthy of scientists' research."</p>
<p>Although China is an advanced ancient civilization, science is not very prosperous. There are only a few scientists, and I am afraid they are busy with national affairs and have no time to study these boring questions of "not knowing life, how can we know death," or reluctantly study and still take out a sign of no ghosts to perfunctorily deal with it, and there is no magic weapon to suppress evil and search for ghosts to cure him; let the wronged ghost of a certain ninth-term student who drowned continue to act recklessly, making students unable to practice swimming in peace, and service soldiers dare not sneak to snore and cool off, what to do? Moreover, at the beginning of the month, our Miss China, the mermaid Ms. Yang, came back from Nanshi to show her skills, isn't she going to perform in Beijing? If the ghost dares to make waves, with Ms. Yang's bravery, it is of course not very important. But if it dares to "cry very sadly," then the tears of the hero may shatter the heart of the beauty.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to learn from Guangzhou comrade Liu Ridong's method of banning men and women from swimming and walking together, and offer a plan.</p>
<p>First, please invite Zhang Tianshi of the 63rd generation to Nanjing to set up an altar and conduct a ritual, and chase after and transcend a certain ninth-term student in the water, so that he can escape the ghost world, ascend to the immortal ranks forever, and bestow the title of Dragon King of the pool to guard the pool. Then not only will the pool no longer have drowning and haunting incidents, but also if there is a drought in the future, the residents of Nanjing can have an extra rain dragon king, and rain a few more inches of sweet rain.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Former Residence <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Bai She</p>
<p>The longing for my former residence has been in my heart every day for the past three years, but it's been limited to just longing. Two months ago, I traveled by boat from a water city in the South to Shanghai. On the morning of the fourth day, I entered the Wusong estuary. The desolation and chaos of Wusong were expected, but I climbed onto the rope ladder of the ship's mast, stretching my neck to look towards my former residence. Black smoke swirled in front of me. At that moment, a white wall and a small window seemed to emerge from behind the green trees, but when I tried to look more closely, I couldn't see anything at all. My former residence had been shelled, that was certainly true, but I couldn't believe that it would be as decayed as other buildings, like a pile of ruins, or even like a flattened wasteland.</p>
<p>Recently, I moved from Shanghai to a small street, and I felt a burst of joy and sorrow because this place is very close to my former residence. Every time I take a car to the train station, I have to pass near my former residence. Every time I pass, I always turn my head to look. Although my body is sitting in the car, my heart has long left. I hate why life is so hurried? I can't even take a look at my former residence when passing by.</p>
<p>But the opportunity finally came one day. On a sweltering afternoon, I hired a car to go near my former residence. Driven by some unknown psychology, I got out of the car before reaching my former residence, and identified the old-time roads among the weeds and rocks, quickly walking towards the familiar ground. The cobblestone road didn't seem to have the light of those days anymore, naturally due to the sparse number of pedestrians. The water in the small pond had dried up, and I didn't dare to expect to hear the noisy croaking of frogs here anymore. I turned a corner, and my feet told me that this was where my former residence was, but I still continued to walk forward. After walking a few steps, I turned back again, because looking ahead, it didn't look like my former residence at all.</p>
<p>Looking towards the west, the angle and distance between the short forest and my eyes proved that I was standing in front of the gate of my former residence. The footsteps of young men and women were no longer seen in front of the short forest. Looking back, who poured a bucket of cold water on my head? My God, there's no gate, no roof, no... just a vast expanse of emptiness. How can you ask me to believe it, how can you ask me to believe that this is my former residence?</p>
<p>A few pieces of broken bricks, is this the powdered wall where I hung my paintings? A few blades of grass, is this all of my property? Scorched earth, is this the trace of evening life? Is it? Is it? Yes! Mother, is it really true?</p>
<p>Is this where I painted wearing a black robe? Is this where I opened bottles of deep red wine with my friends? Yes, the green light on the table was like a lotus petal, so where is the green light? I never didn't know that everything in the world changes, that a paradise a hundred years ago can become a prison for confining prisoners, and that magnificent dance halls can be built under the barren land, but my former residence, you have changed too quickly, yes, my former residence was only recently built on barren land, and soon after was reduced to ashes again. My former residence, don't you think that your days of existence were too short, that you changed too quickly?</p>
<p>The sun is gradually setting in the west. Isn't this the time when I forgot everything under the window and devoted myself to painting? But I want to cry, I want to cry bitterly towards the setting sun, where is my former residence? Oh, my former residence!</p>
<p>To see my former residence again, unless it's in my memory.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am a young man without deep academic knowledge, but I did study in a private school for seven years when I was young. I also haven't learned any craftsmanship, and haven't even been an apprentice. Now I have something to ask for your careful guidance.</p>
<p>For me, without learning or knowledge, wanting to find a relatively good position in society is extremely difficult, to say the least. So for several years, I have been idle at home. Now it can be said that my luck has turned, and I have been introduced by a friend who works as a clerk in a certain company to be a clerk in his company. This is of course unexpectedly delightful, but with my abilities, how can I be competent? Therefore, I replied, "I'm afraid I don't have the ability!" He immediately replied, "It doesn't matter, I can help you with everything." So I became a clerk in this company, and it has been two months now. Speaking of it, I'm ashamed, but for the past two months, all the documents, except for a few simple ones, have been successfully completed with his help. But thinking carefully, relying on others for a long time, even though he is willing to help, if the director finds out after a long time, I will inevitably be expelled. Therefore, I want to study on my own in my spare time. According to colleagues, being a clerk here is not difficult, as long as one has a high school level, it is enough to cope with it. But with my level, how long will it take to reach the high school level at the fastest? What level is my current level equivalent to? Which self-study literature textbooks are the most complete? What is the proper procedure for self-study? The above questions are what I urgently need to know. Please give me an answer! If you have a better method than self-study, please give me careful guidance. I would be twelve times grateful to you. Best wishes</p>
<p>Sincerely, Liu Shao'an</p>
<p>Answer: Since you have such a good friend who is willing to sincerely and wholeheartedly promote you, the opportunity is extremely rare. Therefore, at this time, you should indeed work hard to study on your own and try to catch up. As long as a person has determination and perseverance, they can learn everything well. With your current level of education, it is of course immature, but you are definitely not without the qualifications to learn clerical work. You can practice and apply at the same time, and moreover, you have that good friend who can guide you from the side, so your learning will be more practical and your progress will be faster than the average person who studies official documents on their own. As for the high school level, it is originally a general statement. In reality, to do official documents, you only need to have fluent Chinese and be familiar with the format of official documents to start. The other subjects studied in high school are mostly not needed. Therefore, you should go directly to learning official documents now, and don't go around in circles to "study to the high school level." Practicing official documents cannot be effective by rote learning of model texts, nor can it be applied by rote memorizing some stock phrases. The main thing is to read more of the current incoming and outgoing documents, and at the same time, gather your courage and try it yourself. After you have done it yourself and feel that it is not appropriate, then you can refer to the model texts to see where your problems are. This way, progress will be very fast. The "Detailed Explanation of Current Official Document Formats" published by Huiwentang is a good book, and you can purchase it for reference.</p>

<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>She jumped onto the weighing machine, and a beautiful face with big eyes was reflected in the glass mirror in front of her. She turned her head, and two surprised "Ah!" sounds came out.</p>
<p>"Long time no see."</p>
<p>"Yes. Buying a few things."</p>
<p>One in front, one behind, as if understanding each other, they walked towards the cosmetics department.</p>
<p>The female staff member greeted them with a beaming smile. She bent over to choose the fragrance she needed from the glass cabinet. The other stood behind, showing his head, like a newly married couple.</p>
<p>"This." She stretched out her slender index finger and pointed to a delicate powder box in the glass cabinet.</p>
<p>"This is Feisibeizhi." He brought his head a little closer.</p>
<p>The female staff member hurriedly handed it out and said, "This brand has only been in Shanghai for less than two months, and the price is also cheap;" she turned over the bottom of the box, "four yuan, nine jiao, and a half."</p>
<p>"Okay, take two boxes," she quickly pulled out a ten-yuan bill from her handbag.</p>
<p>The other took out a handkerchief from his trouser pocket and covered his nose.</p>
<p>From the cosmetics to the handkerchief department, one in front, one behind.</p>
<p>Like this, like that, she chose several kinds of colored handkerchiefs, and finally picked out the largest silk one and said to him, "Do you want to buy one too?"</p>
<p>The other nodded, and the money was handed to the female staff member from the handbag.</p>
<p>Slowly walking forward from the handkerchief department, he asked;</p>
<p>"Is there anything else you want to buy?"</p>
<p>"Let's have some ice cream."</p>
<p>They went through the side door to the ice cream parlor and sat down facing each other.</p>
<p>"Two sundaes." She instructed the waiter.</p>
<p>Colored ice cream was placed in front of them, and she skillfully scooped it up with a white copper spoon.</p>
<p>"It's really hot!"</p>
<p>"But my heart is cold!" She stared at the other person.</p>
<p>"Do you still hate me?" He moved his head a little closer.</p>
<p>"It's really hot." He pretended not to hear, and took out a new handkerchief to cover his nose.</p>
<p>After a while, without a word, the ice cream turned into water in the white porcelain basin.</p>
<p>"Mei," she stared at the other person for a long time, "are you married?"</p>
<p>"A woman who loved me ran away!"</p>
<p>"How venomous! There's no way!"</p>
<p>"So I'm not getting married again." He raised his head and called the waiter. She reached out and handed over a bill.</p>
<p>"Sorry for the trouble." He lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Always like that!" she said resentfully.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?" he smiled.</p>
<p>"Let's go home."</p>
<p>They stood up at the same time, and she walked towards the side door.</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same to go this way?" He pointed to the main door of the ice cream parlor.</p>
<p>"My car is waiting over there," she replied.</p>
<p>"Oh... oh... then goodbye." (End)</p>

<h3 id="e273">A Three-Sided View on the "Film Vernacular" Debate <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Shuai</p>
<p>Whether it is a product of the "Literary vs. Vernacular War," or a discovery by a small group of "specialists," the construction of a "vernacular" language for the masses—a language that the masses can speak, understand, write, and read; the definite need for a "unified language"—is at least worthy of our clarion call.</p>
<p>In fact, what do we see? Above the black characters on white paper, we are given some abstract arguments; don't say that this is a "habitual skill" of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Recently, we have read enough of the review articles on "vernacular" and film in this publication. In his article "Vernacular and Film Themes," Mr. Bingyang said: If the theme we adopt is centered on a certain rural village in Jiangnan, then we cannot completely use "Mandarin" here. Here, we have to quote some dialects and local languages... But Mr. Danfeng's article "The Application of Vernacular in Films" means: Vernacular is neither "classical Chinese" nor "vernacular," nor "dialects" or "local languages," but is constructed in another way. However, it only gives an example of saying, "If it doesn't rain, what should we do?"</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Na, because Mr. Danfeng wrote the sentence "At present, we strongly oppose the filming of Cantonese dialogue sound films" in his article, also came up with a large-scale denunciation. The reason is that Mr. Tang Na published an article "Cantonese Sound Films and Vernacular Construction" in Daily Film, and he agreed with filmmakers to film Cantonese films; however, many places also said one-sided words. For example: "According to Mr. Danfeng's statement, advocating Mandarin on the screen now can help eliminate classical Chinese, but as a result, Cantonese audiences don't understand Mandarin, and I'm afraid it will be as alienated and difficult to understand as watching British and American sound films without understanding English." Then, according to Mr. Tang Na's statement, if Cantonese sound films are shown to audiences who do not understand Cantonese, will it not be as alienating and difficult to understand as watching British and American sound films without understanding English? As a matter of fact, in the current China, Mandarin, which is considered official language style, is at least more widespread than Cantonese dialect.</p>
<p>The construction of the vernacular in film has formed the following three theories: (1) Mr. Bingyang's theory is to form a "vernacular" by mixing "dialects" and "local languages" into "Mandarin," which is an impossible thing: in fact, in our special China, each province has its own "dialects" and "local languages," and each village has its own "dialects" and "local languages." Even the language of the south gate - north gate east gate - west gate of each city can find many, many absolutely different words. Due to the inconsistency of "dialects" and "local languages," of course, the language of place A will be completely incomprehensible to people in place B; if our film theme is centered on a certain rural village and mixes in the "dialects" and "local languages" of that place, the films to be shot in the future can only be limited to being shown in a certain rural village, unless they are translated into the "dialects" and "local languages" of other rural villages in another screening location.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Danfeng's is not "classical Chinese," "vernacular," "dialects," or "local languages," but needs to build another simple and easy-to-understand sentence in the so-called "vernacular" used in film, but before we start building anything, we can temporarily not talk about it.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Tang Na advocates the highly developed dissolution of "dialects" to make it a naturalized vernacular (see Mr. Tang Na's original work on the 23rd and 24th of this publication), but in fact it will not be as easy and simple as Mr. Tang Na's ideal. For example, take "Cantonese sound films" as an example. First, can this "Cantonese sound film" allow the masses who are not Cantonese to appreciate it? Second, if they occasionally watch it, can they thoroughly understand it? Third, even if they can understand it partially, can it cause a dissolving effect between the Cantonese language and their own language? This is a very important thing to pay attention to. Moreover, we cannot just take one or two "dialects" to highly dissolve it and think it is "vernacular." We should dissolve the "dialects" of the whole country to be in line with what Mr. Tang Na said is a naturally growing "unified Mandarin"; then, the dozens of dialects in China on a small scale, and the hundreds of dialects on an expanded scale, need to be highly developed at the same time, and I'm afraid all the film companies in China will not be able to afford it? If there is a Cantonese film for a while, and a Jiangxi film for a while, it will be even more of a mess, and it will be difficult to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to say: At this time, we can completely abandon the beautiful name of "vernacular." We should do the work of unifying the language, and I advocate less "empty talk" and more "hard work." We hope that everyone will implement everyone's claims. After several years, whoever's claim is to achieve the success of unifying the language one day is also the day when the "vernacular" is born; it is also the day when whoever's claim to create the "vernacular" reaches the "victory" goal.</p>
<h3 id="e274">In Memory of Marie Dressler <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>According to news from Santa Barbara, the old star Marie Dressler finally passed away on the 28th after a period of suffering, at the age of 61. Marie Dressler suffered from very complex illnesses this time, including heart disease and kidney disease. She had died twice during her illness, but both times she was resuscitated. It wasn't until this time that she couldn't struggle for life anymore. She was born in Canada on November 9, 1873, and devoted herself to the stage in 1886, meeting the audience for the first time. She was only thirteen years old at the time. She was dedicated to her profession and was willing to study it until 1914, when she joined the film industry. Later, she once left the film industry and returned to the stage. *Tillie's Punctured Romance* was a comedy and the first film she shot. Following that, *Tugboat Annie* was considered the most successful work. Among the films she starred in, she worked very enthusiastically and was willing to help with anything that was needed of her. Many of the films she starred in have been successful, and she is now the most beloved star in Hollywood. Millions of moviegoers will feel very sorry to hear the news of her death. The death of this big star will cause some major losses to Hollywood, right?</p>
<p>Marie Dressler is dead, but the impression she left on this world will never be erased. We believe that at least in this twentieth century, the people will not forget the deep impression she gave. Her private life is the same as on the screen, full of happy colors. From the age of thirteen, when she joined the Benotto Meldon Troupe to perform drama, to the end of the nineteenth century, until recently, with the film *Her Sweetheart*, her impression has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of people all over the world. Her film life began when Mack Sennett signed a contract with her at the height of his fame, and she became famous after starring in *Tillie's Punctured Romance*. Following that, her famous films *Anna Christie*, *Emma*, *Min* and *Bill Tugboat Annie* were quite successful, and perhaps the most successful work was the recent *Dinner At Eight*. She had many close friends, and many of them were celebrities. She treated her friends as sincerely and genuinely as she did on the screen. She also liked to support charitable causes throughout her life. Tens of millions of movie fans in this world will regret hearing about the death of Marie Dressler, and thousands of people who knew her will mourn for her!</p>
<p>*Willow Dark, Flowers Bright*, starring the new star Constance Cummings, is a story that combines sorrow and joy, and the performance is very moving. It will be released at the Cathay soon.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Li Lin Haiwei's Life <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Qing</p>
<p>The great, hard-working Li Lin Haiwei is successful. Her numerous films have made a deep impression. Her singing voice and dancing style have intoxicated many people! Looking at her petite figure, one always thinks she is a sickly Lin Daiyu, but no, she is a big star in the sports world! She can play ball, swim, tightrope walk, and ice skate. What is most rare is that she can ride unruly horses. She has an indomitable will and a spirit of advancement; all of this has contributed to her current reputation. She is always very busy every day, and she can't stay still even at home, especially when reporters come to inquire and take pictures of her.</p>
<p>Li Lin Haiwei's style, her bird-like demeanor, and her childish temper can be seen in almost every film. Moreover, because of her gifted singing voice, there will always be a song in her films. Films such as *Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dancing*, *Peach Blossom Village*, and *Phoenix Seeking Phoenix* can all fit her personality and fully develop her performance. She is very suitable for those lighthearted works with songs and dances, and each performance will not disappoint.</p>
<p>She was born in London and is already twenty-seven years old this year. She is originally German, but her mother is British. In addition to English and German, she can also speak French. Therefore, her films are sometimes in English, sometimes in German, and sometimes in French, but they are all equally fluent and delightful.</p>

<p>Li Zhuozhuo came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Originally, she was going to play the lead actress in the "Whirlpool" directed by Yang Xiaozhong of Lianhua Third Factory, but Li had to return to Hong Kong because she had a play to shoot in Hong Kong, so the role of "Whirlpool" was chosen by someone else. Li Zhuozhuo is good at swimming. Her swimming skills were once shown in "Breaking Waves," but according to people, she didn't fully develop her skills there. This time she came to Shanghai, in those days when the thermometer was over 100 degrees, she ran to the Lanyuan Swimming Pool every morning. Her various swimming skill performances were indeed much higher. Therefore, her colleagues at Lianhua called her Mermaid II, especially Lin Chuchu, Chen Yanyan, Li Keng, etc., because they saw her swimming skills and were very envious. So when they went swimming together, they asked Zhuozhuo to make several poses for them to watch. Zhuozhuo is very humorous, and sometimes she even pretends to be a teacher, for example, if Li Keng doesn't swim well, she picks him up and spanks his bottom. Now that Zhuozhuo has returned to Hong Kong, Chuchu, Yanyan, and Li Keng have lost a swimming companion.</p>

<p>— Written by: Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Yi Di's eyes searched all around for Ke Xin Si, but she could not see him. She knew that Ke Xin Si must be talking with that Mr. Pan Qi. Ke Xin Si was indeed talking with Pan Qi, but after speaking three or five sentences, he already knew that the conversation was superfluous. He had already decided on his next move. Pan Qi was the only person who could save him, but searching through Pan Qi's past history, there was no discovery of him having any compassion for a bleeding and dying enemy. Pan Qi had struggled out of poverty to rise to the ranks of the gentry. He had tasted the bitterness of hunger, cold, and disappointment. He had also experienced failure and tragedy. Finally, he had also tasted the taste of victory. He had money, and he also had power. Friends also gathered around him. Opportunities were also easily available. As for the splendor of the palace and the luxury of daily life, these were especially minor matters. But after all of this, he had not learned the meaning of the two words "benevolence and love." "Listen, Pan Qi," Ke Xin Si made this last request, "If you would strike me less... give me some breathing room... the situation won't get so bad... I still have quite a bit of property." Pan Qi said inhumanely, "You don't have a single penny, haven't you already owed twenty different ways. But you don't need to worry so much, there are quite a few who sympathize with you... and they are not all as rude as me, there are many prominent families among them." Ke Xin Si listened and remained silent. Pan Qi smirked, stood up, left Ke Xin Si's elegantly decorated study, and walked into the large living room.</p>
<p>Before her second performance, Yi Di quickly changed her clothes, and feeling that she had some free time, she slipped out of the large crowd and secretly opened the door to Ke Xin Si's study and went inside. Ke Xin Si was sitting at his desk. When he saw an uninvited guest suddenly appear, he quickly pushed the open drawer closed. Unconsciously, he rubbed his hands together, as if he had just put down something cold and wanted to warm his hands. He was absent-minded and looked at Yi Di without seeing her. Yi Di smiled charmingly and said, "I'm afraid I've disturbed you." His gaze seemed clearer, and he looked at her strangely and said, "It's okay." Yi Di sat down impolitely on the corner of his desk. She coquettishly said, "You must be the happiest person in the world." Ke Xin Si smiled bitterly and said, "What makes you think that?" Yi Di smiled and said, "Because you already have everything in the world. Look, what a beautiful home... and..." she self-importantly speculated, "you're already engaged and will be getting married soon." Ke Xin Si seemed to admire her cleverness and smiled again, saying, "I am neither engaged nor married." Yi Di leaned forward and asked, "Then, how are you able to stand it?" Ke Xin Si frowned and pretended to think, saying, "Perhaps it's because I've never met you before." He took out cigarettes and offered one to the guest, but Yi Di politely declined. He said, "Oh, you don't even have this little sin?" Yi Di said, "People always say how romantic and flirtatious the singers are. But as for me, Mr. Ke Xin Si, I've been on Broadway for so long, but I'm still the same as when I left home." She patted Ke Xin Si's hand. He felt that Ke Xin Si didn't quite believe her words, so she silently sat down and picked up a small bronze figure from the table and played with it. She said, "I am also a person who is fascinated by art." (To be continued)</p>
