<p>美國總統羅斯福氏爲挽救美國經濟恐慌起見。曾於本月十五日向參衆兩院提出貨幣法案。其内容要點有三。第一爲降低美國貨幣之純金成分。第二爲由財部接管聯邦凖備銀行之藏金約四十萬萬元（平價）。第三爲設置匯兌平凖基金約二十萬萬元。在美國當局之意。以爲該法案果能實施。必足以提高物價。降低匯兌。而恢復繁榮。發展貿易。尤非此不足以圖功。然由吾人觀察。所謂抬高物價之目的。固未必實現之希望。卽匯價之操縱。恐亦不過加緊國際關係之對立。促成經濟統制之急速進行。故當此備戰恐慌日急之時。羅斯福此種政策。實可謂爲美國經濟武裝先發佈置之表示。而由此以引起之反響。則有未容忽視者也。</p>
<p>據哈瓦斯十八日華盛頓電。羅斯福貨幣計劃。現已以十五對一通過於衆議院幣制委員會。同時該委員會且稱［政府以二十萬萬元作爲基金。穩定匯兌。其目的卽在於防止美國貨幣之匯價。再度受英法之威脅。美國當有自衛之權云云。］由此以觀美國之所以急圖管理全國黄金。一方固在於應付英法操縱匯兌之力量。而尤在於保障美國在海外原有之市場。蓋美國在最近數年中。所受經濟恐慌之影響。損失重大。誠與英法有風雨同舟之况。然法則自始卽深溝高壘。嚴築稅壁。英日亦相繼降低幣價。嚴格操縱匯兌。坐是乃予美國海外市塲以重大之打擊。自羅斯福登台而後。始一反胡佛總統之所爲。首停止金本位之運用。不足則繼之以大舉購金政策。又不足。則繼之以今茲集中黄金統制匯兌之計劃。以爲如此一轉移間。可獲利至巨。由此設置平凖基金。達二十萬元。較之法國之巨量黄金。英國之平凖基金三萬五千萬鎊。自屬勢均力敵。而世界匯兌市塲。亦堪與諸雄相角逐矣。然而英法之敏捷善鬥。又豈可以小視。</p>
<p>試觀自羅斯福貨幣計劃提出而後。倫敦巴黎。卽已掀起嚴重之反響。本埠銀元對英美日之匯價亦一致趨向跌落此諸國貨幣跌價之結局。卽可見貨幣戰爭之激烈。已在躍起急進之中。目前美國國會以内。雖猶有一部份議論。不以由政府接管凖備銀行之黄金爲合法。而對於降低美元純金成分。沒收美元跌價利益。設置平凖基金諸問題。在原則上尚絕無不同意之空氣。蓋美國因受經濟恐慌之激盪。非此不足以圖掙扎。而英法諸國爲保護其市塲計。亦非此無法以謀應付。此貨幣戰之勢出於不得已也。惟是我國以積弱之餘。外匯日跌。則洋貨之披猖日甚。處如此經濟狂潮中。將如何謀經濟自衛之方耶。</p>

<p>中鮮各類人民集成獨立運動</p>
<p>間島是什麽、是島、是半島、或是名雖是島而實非島、在海洋中、抑在陸地上、我國版圖遼闊、又是地處關外、恐爲一般人所未及注意、卽將滿洲視作生命綫的日本、五年前間島民衆大暴動、日本貴族院有一議員說、［一彈丸島民的暴動、只派一軍艦、卽可了事、］是則日本貴族議員中、亦有認間島爲［島］者、實則間島非島嶼、他位於吉林東南部的陸地、而且是有山嶺的陸地、與朝鮮接壤、遥對日本新瀉、是從朝鮮到東北的必走的路徑、</p>
<p>查吾國地圖、向無間島之名、以圖們江自茂山以下、沿江多有灘地、而光霽略前假江之地爲大、縱約數里、寬約一里、計有地二千餘畝、原爲泥沙淤積、且與圖們江北岸相連、其後忍與岸離、使江流歧出、儼成一島、（或謂光絡七年韓民於圖們江北岸私掘一溝、使江流歧出、理或有然）韓民墾於是者、初尙歲納八千兩之租銀於我、光緒二十九年、韓官始名其地爲間島、指爲韓領、此間島名稱之所由來也、是年我延吉廳同知陳作彦、因平韓民之亂、與韓員訂草約十二條、第八條曰、古間島卽光霽谷假江地、向准鍾城韓民租種、今仍循舊辦理、是間島之應屬於吾國、且爲吉林省之一部、已成鐵案、中國勢力至是亦稍稍回復、及日俄戰局旣終、韓國爲日本所併吞、三十一年、日本駐韓軍司令官長谷川好道、巡視北韓、至會寗、韓民上書訴請保護間島墾民、又派代表至統監府訴之、時日本亦經調查間島地形利便、可資開發、遂於三十三年七月派兵往間島設統監府派出所、是爲日本與我國直接交涉之始、我國政府旣聞其事、乃派陳昭常邊務督辦、辦理防禦及勘界事宜、一面内務部向日使交涉、彼此爭　、久而不决、彼時日本以光霽略以東爲東間島、和龍峪一帶爲西間島、爲兩國未定之界、其所執之詞、亦不外往者韓民妄以圖們江北岸之地爲其所屬之理由、並無其他確證、終以我方所持理證眞確、毫不退讓、迨實統元年、安奉鐵綫交涉、以日本自由行動而解决、日使伊集院遂乘機解决中日間一切之懸案、間島問題、遂亦於是時解决、</p>
<p>自宣統三年中日安奉鐵路國境通車恊約成立以後、間島就成日本移殖朝鮮人民的特别區域、亦爲日本浪人的居留地、同時亦是朝鮮抗日志士的避難所、</p>
<p>間島鮮人、名難爲自由移殖、實則全被日人所驅策而來、旣來之、則耕之耘之、雖不能視爲樂土、亦尙可安居、但回望祖國之爲日本帝國主義所踐踏、不能無感於衷、間島旣形成爲特别區域、九一八前、東北當局之權力、旣不能及、而該地的居民、又極複雜、有目不識丁的朝鮮農民、與少數吉林的土著、有日本浪人、有朝鮮革命志士、有馬賊胡匪、良莠共煮於一爐、所以間島就成爲革命的策源地、也是盜匪的巢穴、現在的間島、已由抗日獨立運動、一變而成爲［人民革命政府］了、茲將其經過、詳述如下、</p>
<p>第一期　自一八九四年淸日戰爭後、朝鮮名爲獨立國、但鮮民之在日本的淫威下、水深火熱、正和現在的東北情形相似、到一九一○年、日本完全併吞了朝鮮以後、朝鮮憂國志士、恢復祖國之念、未嘗一日忘懷、於是渡豆滿江而羣向間島、度其亡命生涯、奔走其革命運動、這是鮮民革命的起點、</p>
<p>第二期　一九一九年、朝鮮國内獨立運動突起、間島居留鮮民羣起響應、獨立運動團體、有十餘個之多、一九二零年、日本派兵鎭壓、自朝鮮亡命於間島的革命志士、日益增加、於是設立各種學校、授以革命運動的敎育、培植反日思想、煞費苦心、一九二一年、朝鮮的共産黨、在京城設立中央本部、此輩向來主張獨立運動者、一變而爲共産宣傳了、更在間島之龍井、設立東洋學院、宣傳反日思想與共産主義、</p>
<p>第三期　這是由獨立運動轉入共産宣傳、以至於蘇維埃成立的過渡期、自一九二一年起、間島共産思想漸盛、直至一九二七年、被日本當局檢舉、兼之黨内派别爭鬭、異常猛烈、因之三四年間、活動漸見沉點、</p>
<p>第四期　經過一度沉點後、聲勢又漸浩大起來了、一九三零年五卅間島暴動後、據說在我國的共産黨員、亦有少數加入、於是間島共産的組織、益加完密、聲勢日益擴大、口號是打倒帝國主義、沒收在間島東拓公司的財産、沒收土地、不納捐稅、建設間島蘇維埃政府、</p>
<p>往昔日本對於間島、向取放任、及九一八奪取滿洲成功以後、於是動員軍隊、但一次壓平後、不久氣焰又熾、因當地農民居多數、當日［僞］軍到達時、彼等卽恢復常態、從事耕作、必要時、又羣集起事了、不過朝鮮人民的心坎中、志在反日而企圖獨立、對於共産思想、有時不能喚起彼輩的熱烈同情、所以最近的間島共産黨幹部、順應鮮民心理、激勵一般農民的反日感情、組織農民軍、以期打倒日本帝國主義爲目的、並聯絡東北失敗的義勇車、與日［僞］軍相抗持、一九三二年、據日本當局的調查、謂已有四區蘇維埃政府的成立、實行共産政治、領導民衆積極反日［僞］運動、茲將各團體分述於下、㈠反日會、由反日的鮮民與東北志士所組織、其中有地主、資本家農民、一致團結、反抗日本、以逐出日本勢力於東北領城爲宗旨、㈡反日農工遊擊隊、以武力驅逐日本勢力爲宗主、㈢反日自衛隊、以防禦日本勢力、與保衛地方爲主旨㈣農民委員會、以農民鬭爭爲策略而組織、保障貧農利益、團結農民羣衆、反抗日［僞］勢力、與土豪劣紳、高利貸等、㈤反日兵士代表大會、由義勇軍編成敢死隊、專事反日暴行工作、㈥少年先鋒隊、分組織·宣傳·訓練、等中小隊、由反日自衛指揮行動、專任步哨之任務、㈦人民革命政府、原爲反日民衆政府、後改爲人民革命政府、劃定區城、制定國境、實行蘇維埃政治、爲一切羣衆團體的中樞、</p>

<p>下午並在務本女中公開演講</p>
<p>丹麥是我們的一個理想國家</p>
<p>我國欲復興農村應以此借鑑</p>

<p>略謂、今日承蒙招待甚幸、丹麥地位適中、極宜於國際感情恊調之工作、現在丹麥之民衆學校敎育全國人民數達全人口四分之一、有人以爲丹麥民衆學校國家觀念極深、其實此非民衆學校之優點、蓋丹麥民衆學校創辦於浪漫時代、彼時國家主義盛行、故學校遂亦染有此種色彩、而丹麥民衆學校之特點、則在注重師生合作及語言感情之融通、丹麥哲人耿主敎有言曰、語言爲人格及生命力最高之表現、其言雖不重視文學、然丹麥農民現十九皆能識字、良以語言之敎導、激動之使然、丹麥民衆學校之敎課、其目的不在適合職業的需要、而在使人民回返其原來之環境、從事改進、民衆敎育、並不在考試學生、而在回答學生之問題、耿氏又以爲兒童尙在天眞時代、不可以重担之敎材壓之、是以在十四歲至十八歳之期間、不宜於受政治敎育、必待十八歲、方爲正當實行國民敎育之時期、因此時靑年對於各方面之問題發生興趣、故宜誘導之、從歷史上求得解答、</p>

<p>其目的不在改善本國、且在促進國際和平、余所主辦之國際成人敎育學院、卽本此使命而生、初辦時規模殊簡陋、現已逐漸繁榮、有各國學生約一百二十人、惟各國國民性不同、對於敎育所取態度亦異、經吾人盡力使其合作、現各人已能在同一課程下受敎、且感情亦融洽、儼然一小國聯矣、大凡國際機關若各國無誠意合作、而有互抱仇視態度、則永無成效可言、實則無一國可以自豪其本國之文明、已包括人類所有之優點、各國有各國之特長、故首在互相諒解、而後則眞正之大同世界可期實現云、</p>

<p>我在中學畢業後，就到社會上服務，迄今已有五年。初畢業時對於各種學科我都不大喜歡，因爲這時祇喜歡玩啊！做了事體之後，情形便漸漸不同，生活的鞭子，時時在抽打着我，使我整日價生活在煩悶，痛苦的情緒中。於是我便喜歡研究學問，爲的是好使我精神上愉快一點。因爲我事事都喜尋根究底的緣故，我便想讀歷史。這是我爲什麽要選定歷史作研究科目的由來。</p>
<p>我現在已經讀了好幾部一般的本國史，如各大書局的高中本國史敎本及王桐齡的中國通史之類，但是這些書讀了之後，仍舊不能得到什麽益處，因爲它們都未把人類丨中華民族丨的整個活動，社會變遷之槪况告訴我。使我知道過去對於現在的影響或因果關係。它們祗告訴我些大人物和英雄的名字，他們的本領是如何大，他們天賦的卓絕，好像這一般人是另外一種人，與我們凡人是逈然不同；它們祇告訴我些朝代的變更，政權的轉移丨丨如宦官貴戚權力的消畏；它們祗告訴我些國内和國外的戰爭，外族的侵犯，等等。至於爲什麽要如此，究竟當時是如何情形，它們却從未給我一些暗示。</p>
<p>後來我又讀了一些關於文物制度的歷史，但也是雜亂無章，毫無系統。總而言之，這些書都是把大部頭的史料書縮成簡本，而不是［史］。</p>
<p>現在我不能再依賴這些歷史大綱之類的書了，我要直接從史料中去研求了。</p>
<p>我本來打算從古代起一直往下研究，但是中國古書的文字非常艱深，我不能懂得。就是看了注釋，也仍然是莫名其妙。因此我覺得治中國史必先通訓詁之學，所以我現在第一步預備先研究［文字學］及考據之學。這種研究打算一年弄好。</p>
<p>等到這些都粗通之後，再去讀古書，有系統的把中國史書一部部的讀下去（我所擬讀的書另詳書目表）。</p>
<p>計劃雖則這樣定了，但是我却發生了以下的問題：第一，是研究時間的不足；洽國學眞是難極了，起初以爲文字學是不久可以弄通的，誰知買了本［文字學］讀了以後，覺得這樣東西也不是容易的事，非有長期間的學習不能粗通，不能應用。再想到二十四史那樣多的書，更不知需費多少時候纔能讀完。像我這樣讀書時間很少的人（每天晚上閑空時間頂多三小時）怎麽讀得完。第二，讀文字學及古史學（如資治通鑑之類）太枯燥不能引起我的興趣；第三，書籍的不充分，不敷研究之用。</p>
<p>有了以上數點，我對於我的讀書計劃發生了懷疑，恐怕它不能實現，故希貴部能給我解决困難。或者代我訂一個自學計劃，不過我却望你們注意到我的目的：我並不是想做史學專家；祇是要想明瞭現社會的過去的情形，使我了解現社會所以是這個樣了的原故而已。</p>

<h3 id="c184">娶妻的標準 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 琪玲</p>
<p>誰個男子不了娶妻？除非他是一個不健全的殘廢。但是誰也沒有破工夫去省察一下，怎樣的女子，才是標凖的妻？所以結果不圓滿的很多，他們的焦點，是沒有得到標凖的妻。</p>
<p>因此，我覺得這問題很有討論的必要，尤其一般將要結婚或有了戀人的靑年，更加亟應研究對方是否合於標凖妻的條件，然後結合。否則正所謂［貽誤終身］弄得爲害匪淺。</p>
<p>自我個人觀察所得，標凖妻須有下列六條件方可。</p>
<p>（一）品行良行　俗云［娶妻娶德］，倘若娶了一個［河東獅吼］或者［浪蕩不湛］的女子，那還有什麽家庭幸福！</p>
<p>（二）體格健全　有了［健全的母親才能生健全的孩子］，我這裏所說的，並不是要像體育家般的魁梧，祗要不是［身弱多病］就行了。</p>
<p>（三）面目端正　嬌妻惹禍，自古已然，所以我認爲黄臉婆子也可以，祗要伊不麻不疤，眼不斜，嘴不歪就行了。</p>
<p>（四）不愛摩登　至多三分摩登，必須七分古板。因爲所謂摩登的裝飾費，我們窮小子的一月薪水，還不够買一雙高跟鞋。</p>
<p>（五）精通文字　學貫中西的女子，果眞能去應用所學否？並且不是我看低女權，倘使敎妻出去賺錢來貼家用或養丈夫，中國還沒有到這個程度。所以粗通文字，也就行了。</p>
<p>（六）能襄家務　娶妻的第一個目的在［接後］，第二個目的就在助理家務，因有丈夫整日在外，假使妻也整日在外，或者袖手旁觀，對於一切家務毫不顧問，那還稱什麽［賢内助］呢？　以上六條，不過是我個人的觀察而已。</p>
<h3 id="c185">妻 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 寂寞徐生</p>
<p>算命先生說：［妻財子祿］可見這四件東西，是人們最關心的寶貝；否則算命先生何以不把别的寶貝來迎合人們心理呢。我現在不妨把第一件寶貝丨妻丨來談談。</p>
<p>人們那個沒有妻，那個不想娶妻，當然妻是重要的傢伙了。所以除了新人物喚妻呌做［吾愛］以外，普通人當新婚蜜月的時候，那個不喚［寶貝］的。當然，妻是精神肉體上的慰藉品，嘘寒問暖，抱衾與禂，生男育女，都是這寶貝的應盡義務；所以古人喚做［内助］啊。甚麽梁鴻孟光，親操井臼；相如文君，當罏賣酒；京兆畫眉，韻事流傳；歷史上都說是賢伉儷。便是美國大小說家華盛頓歐文，他做了一篇耐寒花傳，中有句道：［不經患難，人莫知其妻之賢淑也］。［當失意時，得枕畔温語，解我愁思；出門環覩，親戚故舊，無一親我，俱作鄙夷不屑之戕；獨至家庭，親愛依然，猶有獨尊之槪，其氣爲之一振。］歐文是個老　夫，尙且說出這種話來，可見中外人，沒有不把妻子當做寶貝的。</p>
<p>妻子的確是件寶貝，因爲［妻敎］比任何敎育爲有實用，甚麽母敎，父敎，兄敎，師敎，那裏及得來；所以［怕老婆］，是一個人成功的元素。俗語說得好，［怕老婆，會發財］。便是這個道理。一個人誰不希望發財，所以怕老婆的人很多了。現在普遍的妻敎，不外［發財］［做官］兩件事；也許發財做官的人，得力於［妻敎］罷。不過古人的妻敎，有與今人不同的。宋朝有一個楊朴，眞宗召他做詩；他說不能。眞宗問他臨行的時候，有人做詩送你嗎？楊朴道：沒有，只有老妻做了一首，說甚麽：［且休落拓貧杯酒！更莫猖狂愛吟詩！今日捉將官裏去，這回斷送老頭皮］。眞宗聽了大笑，便放他不去做官。現在做妻子的心理，完全和古人不同；所以做丈无的挖空了心思，拚命來掙錢，百般來鑽謀，想博妻子的一笑哩。</p>
<p>[P妻子</p>
<p>— 定華</p>
<p>［走出房門一把鎖，走進房間沒有火，着壞鞋子無人做，破了襪子無人補，有妻子那知道無妻子的苦。］上面是一首未婚者的相思歌，我家二叔在四年前還沒有娶妻的時候，好像也唱過。的確，一個人到了相當的年齡，結婚也是一件很需要的事，妻子所能給與你的好處，除了替你做鞋襪之外，在你失意的時候，妻子可以來安慰你，在你做某一樁事情能力够不到的時候，妻子可以來帮助你。、</p>
<p>但是娶妻也不是一件容易辦的事，旣要顧到對方的外貌，又要留意對方的内心，就是和你看中伊而伊看中你的愛人結婚，也是有問題的。瑞典文豪史特林堡的一篇［愛情與麵包］，就是描寫一位月賺二百五十克洛納的參事處職員，名呌法克的，在事前沒有把婚後麵包問題，和子女敎養問題詳細打算過，就去和他的愛人璐易斯結婚，後來到底演成了一幕悲劇，結果是妻子和兒子被丈人領去，債主們把他家裏所有的東西，一齊搬得精光丨丨椅子，架子，紅木床，刀，叉，盆，碟，盂，壺………</p>
<p>上面的一段故事，正指示出中國目前離婚事件，層出不窮的一種緣由！</p>
<h3 id="c186">理想的妻子 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 瑞卿</p>
<p>伊生長在富有詩意的古城裏；伊是一個學者的女兒，所以伊受過良好的敎育。</p>
<p>伊是一個最温和的，最美麗的，最懇摯的，最多情的，最高尙的；身體智識丨都很健全的人。</p>
<p>伊的温和，並晨庸愚，亦非懦怯；伊彷佛是夏日酷暑侵人後的一絲凉風，微拂着人們，便覺得氣爽神淸，遍體舒暢。</p>
<p>伊的美麗，不是裝飾，不是衣衫；伊生成曲綫的身段，漂亮的面龐，紅潤的皮膚，富有彈性的肌肉，聰明活潑的精神，於是人們覺得伊無一處不美。</p>
<p>伊的懇摯，不是虚僞，不是糾纒；伊沒有利己的私見，伊能够愛護丈夫，體貼入微；不管喜怒哀樂，一切都内心純眞的表現。</p>
<p>伊的多情，是永久的，是不變的；伊的高尙，是自然的，是自然的，是主觀的。</p>
<p>伊的身體，極美妙，極健康；不肥不瘦，修短適中。伊能運動，能跳舞能游泳，能………　　伊的智識，十分的正確：伊能書，能文，能會畫，能音樂，能唱歌，能酬應，能針黹，能烹調，有育子女，能持家………在社會上是一位交際花，在家庭内是一位賢主婦。</p>
<p>伊自幼便生長在我的心窩裏，伊的美德，才能和一切的一切，也都日進月增地漸漸長成。我無一日一時一刻一分一秒能够忘了伊。</p>
<p>但是伊如今却不知在何處？</p>
<p>正幻想着新婚之樂的朋友們！在你們預備娶妻之前，切不要忘記度量度量自己，可有解决婚後麵包問題，和子女敎養問題的能力？否則，徒然去串演一幕法克和璐易斯串演過的悲劇而已。至於妻的實惠是受不到什麽的，何苦來？！</p>

<p>— 炳華</p>
<p>星期六那天，到高橋去玩，回到家已過了吃晚飯的時間，一進門，妻的臉上就露了不高興神氣說：</p>
<p>［今天一定頑的有意思吧。］</p>
<p>［倒也沒什麽……］我就含糊答了一句，因我知妻已生了氣。</p>
<p>［我以爲你這樣晚不回來，怕你魂靈被人拘走了呢。］</p>
<p>［你總愛多說人，請你原諒我這一次，下次早回來］。我帶懇求聲調對妻說。</p>
<p>［愛回來不回來，反正以後我不管你了，家裏的事，你另請高明吧］。妻仍就是怒氣冲冲的。</p>
<p>於是爭吵因此開始了。</p>
<p>經過了三分鐘的靜默，我們各自含怒不言，抽了一根烟，心裏更覺煩惱的很，一人就跑到樓上去睡了，我雖閉着眼，但並沒有睡着。</p>
<p>過了不多一會，妻也上來了，伊鑡我和衣而睡，好像很可憐我的疲倦，伊輕輕地把我的皮鞋脫了，拿了條被兒，替我蓋上，而且把帳子放下，那時我就裝醒了，一眼看見妻的臉上怒氣早已消滅，我心裏如釋重負。</p>
<p>、［你還生我的氣嗎？揍我一頓，出出你的氣，好不好？］我撤嬌似的把頭靠在妻的身上。　　［誰生你的氣？………我現在更愛你了，你知道嗎？］妻從心坎中發生來的話。</p>
<p>一看桌上的鐘已到十點了。</p>
<p>［飯都忘吃了］。我倆不約而同的說。</p>
<p>［家裏菜飯都冷了。我們到外邊去吃好不好？順便去維也納跳無］。</p>
<p>［隨便你……］妻說完，和我接了個甜蜜的長吻。</p>
<p>［喲！你今天臉也不括，刺的人臉上痛的］</p>
<p>。妻笑着說。</p>
<p>［………］我也笑了。</p>
<p>在此相視而笑中，我們夫妻仍就和好如初。</p>

<h3 id="c188">談怕老婆 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 樂也</p>
<p>男性中心與女性中心爭辯，現在依然沒有閙得淸楚，也是一件不容易解决的事。提倡女權論者固然說，中國的婦女，已經在男子壓迫之下。呻吟了幾千年了，現在要抬頭的，要自動解放的。這一說並沒有錯。確實的，中國女子在禮敎束縛之下，已經過幾千年的痛苦，但是反對女權的男子又這麽說：中國女子雖受禮敎的束縛，這是名義上的，但事實上女權已高於一切。這一說也沒有錯，［怕老公］的不常聽見人說：［怕老婆］却已是家喻戸曉，十分普遍，幷且自古以來都有之。</p>
<p>［怕老婆］是一件很通行的事，現在因時代變遷的關孫，［怕老婆］與［管老公］的方式，也隨着變遷了，從前的女子，多數是纒足，終年不出戸庭，就是外出，也坐在轎子裏，婢僕擁護着，走過幾條街，那裏知道外邊的事？所以舊式女子管老公，祇是在家裏，及晚上限定一個回家時間，如有違犯，就待執行伊的裁制權丨一閫令，可是那個閫令的執行，只能限於閫以内。不能及於閫以外，男子在外幹什麽壞事，除非得到密報，否則斷然非胭脂虎能够管到的　　現在時代不同了，女子對外交際的偉大力量，已駕乎男子之上，男子所到的地方，如跳舞，游泳，戲劇，及其他娛樂塲所，也少不得女子的足跡，不但男子反做女子的高等隨從。男子在例行工作時候，若是消遣時間，他的夫人例有隨同行走的權利，或竟有强制伊的丈夫作何種消遣的可能，於是許多男子，想要幹他不規則的娛樂，也因爲監視，竟然不可能了。</p>
<p>所以現在女子，對伊丈夫的行動，因在隨時監視之下，至男子方面，要幹什麽不正當的娛樂，從前是怕老婆知！現在是怕老婆見，怕是</p>
<p>一樣的，不過方式有點不同罷了。</p>

<p>— ＭＯ</p>
<p>很偶然地在［神秘之街］邂逅到了一别十年的老同學Ｈ君，這使我獲到了意外的欣喜。照習俗。舊雨相逢，免不了假借杯盤，藉以互訴别來的衷曲。我也未能免俗，於是，便相將地跑上了過去照顧熟了的新雅茶室去。</p>
<p>在一個幽靜的角落裏坐下去。呌了兩盅茶，點了幾味下酒的小菜，幷來了一斤陳年花彫。　　侍者把酒菜端上來了。我們便一壁斟着酒，一壁閒談天。我們談到國家的隰杌不安，我們也談到母校的風雨飄摇；最後，我們談到了配偶的問題。</p>
<p>［您可曾結了婚］？Ｈ君君問我。</p>
<p>［慚愧得很！行年三十，中饋猶虚］。我忸怩地答着］。</p>
<p>［您是多麽地幸福］！Ｈ君帶着羨慕的口氣說　　［幸福嗎？眼見得所認識的同學與朋友，都各有着一位年靑貌美而摩登的夫人。當花晨，當月夕，在樹蔭下，在戲塲中，共同過着甜蜜的生活。有的更有了一個愛情的結晶，玲瓏可愛的小寶寶，來凑凑家庭的熱閙。而我呢，除了半箱行李，兩架舊書之外，剩下來的只是赤條條的單身漢。每當更殘人靜的時候，每當夜雨衾寒的當兒，是要怎樣地感到人生的孤寂，怎樣地感到單身的凄凉！像老兄的生活，那眞是幸福而使我羨煞呵］！我說完了話，深深地喝了一口花彫，注視着Ｈ君，等待他的意見。　　Ｈ君現着很傷感的態度說道：［老兄聰明人，怎麽也只見到結婚的樂處呢？俗語說：［結婚是戀愛的墳墓］！我現在可以下一轉語：［娶妻是有期徒刑的宣判！］自從我們從學校離别後，我很徼倖地在Ｋ省找到了一樁不能算小的差事，進欵倒也不少，生活問題也就解决了，便去物色我那未來的嬌妻。</p>
<p>［不久］，Ｈ君抽了一口烟，繼續說道：［在Ｋ省的一位新交，便替我介紹了一位在當地女中畢業的某女士和我認識。某女士，我現在的妻子，在那時，確是年輕貌美，學識才幹兩方面也不算壞，這樣，渴想着女人已久的我，便加速地由認識而朋友而愛人以至結婚。而我的有期徒刑的執行，便也在那個時候開始。</p>
<p>［我在未結婚以前，生活是多麽地舒適，行動是多麽地自由。一結了婚，便好像從事政治活動的人員碰着密探一般，處處受着妻的監視。這個倒也可以原諒伊。最難堪的是我的簿記上的數目字，也起了劇烈的變化。起初是從剩餘變化到收支相抵，後來郤變成了赤字。照我妻的學力，在這種情形乏下，伊原可以出去我點職業幹幹，藉以彌補我的不足。可是，勞動只該丈夫配去做，伊的工作，每日只是在怎樣修飾，怎樣裁製新衣，怎樣才可以誇耀同性，取悅異性。我，爲了女人，只有像啞子吃黄蓮般忍受着。</p>
<p>［過了兩年，那個被人稱譽作愛情的結晶的兒子産生了。不錯，兒子這東西，在人家是點綴家庭的缺憾。可是在我呢，郤像徒刑期滿的犯人出了獄重行犯罪，因而判處無期徒刑的宣示。什麽僱奶媽啊，做彌月啊，以及一切的負担，把我那挺直的軀幹，壓迫得成了個駝子。　　［現在，我那個狗兒，已經到了就學的年齡了，不給他唸書，有負了做父親的責任；給他唸書吧，在現代商業化的學校制度下，沒有錢是不能唸書的。爲了這種種我久想越獄。而您呢，我的老友卻渴想着那外被糖衣内充苦藥的滋味，何其不思之甚呢］？</p>
<p>Ｈ君說完了話，那雙飽經世故的眼睛，怪可怕的注射着我，在等待我那理想的反駁。我惟有像在尊嚴的家長的訓導下，只是Ｙｅｓ與Ｏ·Ｋ</p>

<p>抛棄舊有髮妻與孩子</p>
<p>旋與劉景桂小姐訂婚</p>
<p>忽又與滕爽女士結婚</p>
<p>據本月十九日北平京報載、去年全國運動會鉛球冠軍逯明、在天津南開中學時、卽代表我國出席遠東運動會、後轉學上海交通大學、、威名仍不稍减、先後赴遠東四次、現年三十有四矣、自南京參與全運歸來後、甫經兩週、卽與平市運動女將騰爽女士結婚、現逯明仍供職平綏路局下花園車站、昨日劉景桂女士自宣化函北平、申述在宣化與逯明定婚經過、並將依法起訴、茲將原函披露如次、全國父老同胞公鑒、我現在要舉發一個人面獸心的人、給諸位看看、說起他來、大槪平常注意體育消息的人、都知道的、就是那去年全國運動會的鉛球冠軍丨逯明、呸、幸虧是個鉛球冠軍、要是牌號再大點、更不知要造什麽孼呢、他丨逯明本來是個</p>
<p>村野鄙夫　父母望子心切、拿着汗滴禾下換來的錢、供他升學、誰知道他一入都市、便生異想、更因在體育界稍有微名、便竭力學起摩登來、唉、［摩登、摩登、天下多少罪惡、皆因此而生、］第一個問題、盤旋在他腦子裏的、就是老婺太不高明、怎樣也玩玩戀愛、跑回家去、旣不顧父母抛媳的痛心、又不顧髮妻舊日的愛情、竟把自己的女人孩子、驅出門外、女家本係平民、敢怒而不敢言、結果討了點贍養費完事、這是時代潮流、可以自由離婚、這不算什麽、離婚以後、緊跟著就是、</p>
<p>追求對象　了、西碰一個釘子、東抹一鼻子灰、這些事情、因爲有碍各位士的名譽我也不便詳述、最後在張家口碰見了滕女士、這位女士、别是慧眼、居然愛上了他、我們可以想到、他那受寵若驚的樣子、但是相處不久、又與滕女士要變卦了、於是一溜烟的跑到宣化、各處奔走、央及朋友、給他介紹女人了、他向别人懇切的表示說、［外方女子、簡直靠不住、不再講愛了、］隨着又把滕女士的一切一切、一五一十說了個體無完膚、他的朋友、聽了他這一套</p>
<p>甜言蜜語　以爲誠懇表示、絕無異詞、於是給他想辦法、其中有一位、曾經敎過我書的、便把我介紹給他、我向來是不講社交的、對於逯明的歷史、一點也不知道、可是我的先生給我介紹、我是十二相信、絕無差錯、便去徵來我的舅父、和一位堂兄的意思、（他們都是逯明的朋友）結果各方都很同意、在家長主婚之下、我和他訂了婚、眞是出人意外、在去年十一月一日的報紙上、我竟發見了他同滕女士結婚的消息、我得着這個消息、我恨懷疑他（逯明）的爲人、一方面</p>
<p>和我訂婚　一方面又和别人結婚、定了的而不結婚、不定婚的反而結婚、他這一套欺弱人的把戲、我一點也莫明其妙、不久他來找我了、據他說、［我和滕女士結婚、原是受人逼迫的、决非我的本願、］所以還求和我履行婚約、但是我以後才知道、原來滕女士允許負擔一部份他的前妻的贍養費、啊、我明白了、他要同時娶兩個女人、可是我能答應他這種要求嗎、他啼哭着、向我請求、幾次被我拒絕、他這個把戲、看看沒唱好、又託人調停着、</p>
<p>解除婚約　我也沒允許、這種社會蟊賊、衣冠禽獸、我能容他嗎、我有我的辦法、好了、這就是他［鉛球冠軍］出賣了愛情、出售了人格、而他所欺騙的人、竟是他的朋友的學生、我不禁想起林主席勸告運動員注意道德的話、劉景桂泣告、</p>

<p>意海軍球員、行動粗暴、故西聯會對之、異常注意、自與臘克斯兩次和局後、第一次二比二、第二次一比一、昨日乃作第三次重賽於虹口公園足球塲、西聯會爲鄭重其事起見、特由西聯副會長李特、親自出馬、執行裁判、並由馬許爾與勃脫爲巡邊員、兩人亦爲相聯之重要裁判、西聯會職員往觀者、亦有十餘人、比賽結果、臘克斯以三比一淘汰意海軍但意海軍不料因失敗而老羞成怒、賽畢、將李特包圍、謂比賽時間不足、尙差七分鐘、有欲將其手表拉下者、於是拳足齊下、將李特衣服、撕成碎片、幸該軍軍官及巡捕等趕來、方得解圍、動手之三球員、聞西聯决嚴重處置、至於比賽情形、昨日鳳勢甚大臘克斯上半時得風助、連中三球、下半時意海軍反攻無效、於將終局時、射中一球、成三比一之結果、</p>

<p>林肯與南華會相繼敗北</p>
<p>威爾殊聖約瑟躍登前茅</p>
<p>（香港特訊）上週香港足球發生巨大變化、維視一切之林肯陸軍、以一比四被威爾殊殺一個大敗、衆望所歸之南華會、以一比二敗於平庸之砲兵隊、聖約瑟與英海軍原在同等地位、勝負固難預料、結果聖約瑟以二比零勝、以上三組、勝負得失、與冠軍前途、均發生極大變化、香港之以三比一勝西洋會、固無足輕重也、茲將最近大勢述下、</p>
<p>隊名　已賽　勝　和　負　勝球　失球　得分</p>
<p>林肯隊十四　十　一　三　三一　十六　二一</p>

<p>砲兵隊十二　三　○　九　十八　三十　六分</p>
<p>四洋會十三　一　○　十二十一　五四　二分</p>
<p>南華戰砲兵一塲、是日港中球迷之往觀者、盈千累萬、較之去週南華戰林肯時、不遑多讓、是役南華出塲健將、與上星期戰雄極一時之林肯隊時、完全無異、而竟敗於自開賽以來、九敗二勝之弱旅砲兵隊、是則南華至敗之故、爲輕敵耶爲命這耶、抑砲兵之砲火犀利耶、記者不敢妄斷矣、　開最近之足球戰史來算一算賬、覺得與前一週者又差異得多、看來最有希望之南華、雄踞首席之林肯、現在竟敗、降到第三個位置、連亞軍也難得到、</p>
<p>現在最有冠軍希望者當推聖約瑟與威爾殊、大家同是失去四分、雙雙站在首席、雄視一切、聖約瑟之四分、有兩分是失於南華、有一分是失於警察、有一分是央於蘭開夏、同是二比二之和局而失、</p>
<p>列在第二位置者爲海軍隊、一共戰過十二回、失去六分、有四分是失於聖約瑟、一次是二比一、一次是二比零、餘之二分、一是二此二失於南華、一是一比失於林肯、</p>
<p>南華與林肯、都雙雙站在第三位置、同是失去七分、南華之七分、有二分是失於林肯、二分是失於香港會、二分是上週失於砲兵、一分是失於海軍、林肯之七分、二分是失於南華、二分是失於聖約瑟、二分是失於威爾殊、一分失於海軍、</p>
<p>現在之球賬算來雖是如此、再有變動否、眞不敢保說得定、南華戰砲兵、誰不說南華儘得勝利、誰知竟會一比二敗北、事實出出乎情理、弱者竟勝强旅、已不是僅見之一四事、</p>
<p>聖約瑟與威爾殊現在雖然高踞首席、但是强敵之未對壘者尙多、前途實不少荆棘、聖約瑟尙要與南華·林肯·威爾殊·中華·香港會對壘、威爾殊比約瑟還有對海軍兩塲、都是不易對付之隊伍、將來能否一帆風順、長驅直進、不再失敗、實不敢說、苟有失敗、又便不同、</p>
<p>南華現在雖名列第三、對冠軍亞軍、雖然動摇、不過希望不能說絕、若此後果能够不再戰敗、雖然不得冠軍、亞軍也穩得到、因爲聖約瑟與威爾殊對抗儘有一敗、雖戰而和、亦各失一分、南華再來敗他一回、又失兩分、那豈不是雖不得冠軍也得亞軍、海軍情况亦正相同、不過戰役未終、將來變化仍大、後事如何、且看將來始再可分解、今不過就目前之賬算一回而已、</p>

<p>— 陳鴻根</p>
<p>我國遠丁重農，各國未有或先者，蚩蚩之氓務農者十其八九，垂數千載而未易，於以見我國農業之重要。昔者以人口稀少，海禁未開，得善政者爲之導，猶可自足自給。惟自近世以還，受外患，内亂，天災，及苛政，之侵擾，復以農業之因循舊法，不圖自新，遂使自足自給之農村經濟。至於崩潰。言改革者或曰澄淸政治，或曰發展工商業，衆論囂囂，迄未見其有成。雖或由人謀之不臧。然亦緣目標之錯誤。蓋以農業旣爲邦本，今日之社會問題，雖因工商業之發展而日趨於繁雜，然莫不與農業問題相爲表裏，而農業問題，又以農佃制度，爲其核心。何則？自秦廢井田以還，發生私人租佃制，［田非耕者所有，而有田不耕也，………有田者一人，而耕者十人，是以田主日累其半而至於富强，耕者日食其半，以至於窮餓而無告，］（蘇河）此社會之所以擾擾而無安定之日也。然土地之集中究達若干若何程度，不能不有所推究，此本文所以就田産權分布之形態及其差異之原因略加陳述也。</p>

<p>言田産權之分布，卽指農人耕作之田地所有權之分配狀態。依農商部民國八年之統計、（表長從略，）全國農戸總數爲二九，五四八·五二九，其中自耕農佔百分之五八·七，佃農佔百分之二二·九，半自耕佔百分之一八，四·其佃農率最高者如福建浙江達百分之三四·三，安徽百分之三二·三，江蘇百分之三○·三，最低者察哈爾百分之九，六，其他陜西，山西，綏遠，諸省均甚低，敝校卜凱敎授曾於一九二一年就七省十七處二八六六農家作田産權之調查，華北之河北河南山西及皖北諸省，平均自耕農佔百分之七六·五，半自耕百分之一三·四，佃農佔百分之一○·一，其中佃農率最高者僅山西之五台，達百分之六○·二，安徽宿縣次之，爲百分之二○，其餘均在百分之五以内，而河北之鹽山及河南之開封佃農則付缺。如中東部之安徽江蘇浙江福建各處之自耕農平均爲百分之四八，二，半自耕，百分之二一·三，佃農百分之三○·五，其中如浙江之鎭海佃農率高至百分之七六·一，安徽之來安百分之五○·五，江蘇之江寗太平門百分之四八·四，其餘之蕪湖，連江，武進等處，均在百分之一三左右，總計南部大於北方者三倍而有餘，再據實業部之統計地權分布狀况如下；</p>
<p>華北　　　滿洲　　　中部　　　　南部</p>
<p>自耕農　六五·四　四七·三　四○·四○　三三·八</p>
<p>佃　農　一八·○　二八　　　三五·三九</p>
<p>譚平山氏於一九二七年亦曾發表農業人口階級之比例，其結論大致與前者相似。至於各省市縣等之調查，亦有數種資料可資參考，其</p>
<p>精確之程度或可較高。</p>
<p>江蘇省丨據江蘇農業調查錄（已發表之金陵蘇常滬海淮揚四道）所載田主佔百分之三七，三，半田主佔百分之二七·六，佃農百分之三六·一，實業誌所記之佃農百分率較小爲百分之二九，喬啓明氏亦曾調查崑山南通宿縣之狀况，崑山之佃農佔百分之七七，六，而宿縣只百分之二五，五。</p>
<p>浙江省丨據浙西廿縣八五村之調查，自耕戸數佔百分之三二，九，佃農戸數佔百分之三六·七，半自耕戸數佔百分之三○·四，其佃農率略較江蘇爲高，恰與農商部之統計結果相同。</p>
<p>山西陽曲縣丨山西農村敎育改進社之調查陽曲縣念個農村結果，自耕農多在百分之六○丨八○者爲多，榆林坪達百分之九三·五，佃農率之最高者爲黑土港百分之三○，三，其低者不及百分之一，可以證明有田産而務農者多。</p>
<p>雲貴丨其地人口稀少，佃農率較東南一帶，爲低，據二十一年鐵道部湘滇綫雲貴段經濟調查報告，該段共有農戸四六三·七五○，自耕者佔百分之四○，半自耕者百分之三○·佃耕爲百分之二○。</p>
<p>綜觀以上各種統計，則知我國佃農之百分率分布絕不一致，省異於省，縣異於縣，華北異於華南，關外又不同於關内。張心一君曾作比較如下：丨</p>
<p>東北區　　黄河流域　長江流域</p>
<p>及其北區　及其南區</p>
<p>自耕農　　五一％　　六九　　　三二</p>
<p>半自耕農　一九　　　一八　　　二八</p>
<p>佃農　　　三○　　　一三　　　四○</p>
<p>要言之，我國東南一帶佃農率最高，黄河流域最低，東北則介於二者之間。</p>
<p>㈡各地佃農率差異之原因</p>
<p>（一）經濟原因：</p>
<p>（Ａ）地價之高低丨地價愈高，則貧農購地之能力愈低，土地遂入於富者之手，而佃農亦以增矣。據國府主計處統計分全國爲七區，以東南區之二省地價爲最高廣東水田每畝最高達二五○·五元福建亦高至二○○元，次之則爲西南區，四川水田每畝二二五元，貴州二○○元，雲南一四○元，江浙每畝一百四五十元，黄河流域最高者如山東一七○元，河北一五○元，陜西普通每畝約值三十元，東北數省惟遼寗較高，水田高者約百元一畝，而黑龍江吉林高省普通田每畝只十元左右，低者不及一元，至於旱地之價格，亦以東南各部爲高，此所以其佃農率之較高也。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）工商業發達之程度丨丨在工商業發達之區域，其需用之農業品多，農家多行精密農作，以增加其生産，惟是種耕作，必需在充足之資本。一般農民財力薄弱，若購置田地，則所餘無多，流動資本（用於購買肥粉農具，工資等）必感缺乏，收獲因以减低，不若租入他人田地，以一已之資本供經營之費用，反形有利，我國東南沿海一帶，工商業極形發展，爲華北及關外諸省所遠不逮，宜乎其佃農率之較高矣。英國工業革命後，佃農之激增，亦卽由此。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）新地之關係丨丨我國農業始於河南一帶，洪邁容齋隨筆［成周之世，中國之地最狹，……其中國者，獨晋衛齊魯宋鄭而已］。後以人口漸孶，乃向南方擴展，攫土地成爲地主投資開發之處女地。其始則演爲封建制度，後乃蛻變爲私人之租佃制度。故南方之佃農日以增多，東北數省雖亦爲處女地，然以交通之不易，氣候之嚴寒，不宜種植，有淸一代又復禁止移民關外，故其佃農之百分率不若南方之高。</p>
<p>（二）自然的原因：</p>
<p>（Ａ）土質之關係丨丨我國南方宜於種稻，年有可收獲三次者。北方宜種麥，地方較遜於南方，且食米者佔全國人口三分之二，其需要多則其價必高，其獲利也亦必厚。地主自趨向南方種稻之地，以翼收得較高之地租。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）氣候之關係丨丨：</p>
<p>（甲）温度丨丨中國全部多爲大陸性氣候，而以北方及西北各省爲尤甚，温度變化常趨極端，北方一月分之温度，常在冰點以下，夏季炎熱。不减南方，是以有礙於農産物之生長。而長江及沿海之地，暖風時至，廣東則四時如春，絕宜作物之發育。　　（乙）雨量丨丨北方雨量甚少，而又分配不得其時，據德人ＨａｎｎｇｕｌｉｎｓＶｏｎ氏估計，北方平均每年落雨在二十一小時左右，其中百分之七○在六七八月降落，無補於作物之生長，江浙閩粤一帶雨量充足，分配又得其時，故地主多趨集於斯。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）災荒丨丨我國水旱之災時有所見，其地域多在北方，水災之起多由於黄河之汜濫，旱災則緣雨量之不足，據駐華英領事Ａ·Ｈｏｓｉｅ氏估計，自六二○丨丨一六一九年之間，中國發生之旱災北方有四四二次，中部三五二次，南部二五二次，淸光緒十五年之山東大旱，尤屬罕見，民十五年西北又發生重大旱災，自水災言，則在過去之最近一千年中，黄河流域幾無隔十年不發生水災一次，南方自唐宋以迄於淸代，僅南宋時浙江有水災十七次，地主自亦不願投資於災荒頻繁之地，以减少其收入也。（三）社會的原因</p>
<p>（Ａ）人口多寡丨丨丨人口密集之地，土地必不敷分配，佃農率亦必增高，我國現時人口，以四川，江蘇，浙江，廣東，福建等省爲最密，各約在三千萬左右，而山西陜西等省僅爲一千萬上下，再考立法院統計之人口密度，每英方里江蘇八一三人，浙江五五四人，山西一八三人，陜西一六四人，察哈爾一二人，由此</p>
<p>更足以顯明佃農百分率差異之原因。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）生活程度之高低丨丨南部農民生活較北方爲優，所用於食料等必需品以外之費用亦愈大，據卜凱氏調查華北各處每一農家之每年消費額爲一九○·三元六，中東部則爲二八八·六三元，南方之用度旣奢，若收入豐裕，則猶可維持，惟或遴荒歉，則生活難以爲繼，或挪借債欵，至於債台高築，不得不售其田地而淪爲佃農矣。十二，十七，于金大</p>

<p>二　銀的需要</p>
<p>銀的需要，一般說來，可分爲貨幣用，美術工藝及工業用，和印度人中國人的貯藏用三種。銀之做爲美術品，裝飾品，銀器具使用，無論誰都知道，用不着說明。</p>
<p>銀之做爲工業用，最主要者爲照相衛，特别是電影的軟片工業。據說電影軟片工業消費的銀每年約有六千萬盎斯，其中從不用的軟片以化學還元的銀約有百分之八十·故實際的消費額，每年約有一千二百萬盎斯。最近十年來美術工業用的銀消費額如下，其中大半爲美國所使用。</p>
<p>美術工藝及工業用的銀消費額（單位百萬盎斯）</p>
<p>一九二一　　五一　　一九二六年　未詳</p>
<p>一九二二　　六八　　一九二七年　四○</p>
<p>一九二三　　六一　　一九二八年　六一</p>
<p>一九二四　　五八　　一九二九年　五八</p>
<p>一九二五　　未詳</p>
<p>從此可見美術工藝及工叢用的銀消費額，大體每年皆在五六千萬盎斯左右，沒有很大的增减，故這一方面不能左右銀的價格是很明顯的。</p>
<p>貨幣用的銀，在現時除中國外，只有一二不重要的殖民地國家，其他金本位國及虚金本位國，雖也以銀爲補助貨幣；但最近已次第减少了。茲特中國及印度兩最大用銀國家從一九一四年以來每年鑄造銀幣額列表於下：</p>
<p>中國及印度銀幣鑄造額（單位千盎斯）</p>
<p>年次　　　英屬印度　　　中國　　　　　世界總鑄造額</p>
<p>一九一四　一八、九五九　七七、四九九　一九二、五○一</p>
<p>一九一五　五、九二一　一一○、二九四　二二五、一一六</p>
<p>一九一六　七五、一六二　七九、七六四　二九二、一四八</p>
<p>一九一七　九五、八二九　三七、八○六　二八六、五九六</p>
<p>一九一八　一四八、九○八　丨丨　　　　二三八、九九二</p>
<p>一九一九　一五二、二四一　七九、九四四　二九八、三○○</p>
<p>一九二○　三七、三四三　一一五、三七五　二二○、二一八</p>
<p>一九二一　四、九五五　　三五、○九五　　一五五、一六八</p>
<p>一九二二　一、八三四　一○○、九二八　　二二七、二一○</p>
<p>一九二三　二、四六四　九六、八六一　二二三、九九八</p>
<p>一九二四　九八五　　　一八、○二八　　一二○、四二一</p>
<p>一九二八　七六九　　　一四一、三四三　二一六、○九五</p>
<p>一九二九　一、○四一　九六、七五一　　一八五、四三三</p>
<p>一九三○　六二七　　　一○六、四七九　二○六、六一五</p>
<p>這樣看來，印度至一九一九年止，尙鑄造一億五千萬盎斯；但其後則非常减少，一九三零年僅鑄造六十二萬盎斯。中國近年來銀幣的鑄造額雖不見得十分增加；但實占世界總鑄造額半分以上。故中國的景氣如何，實與銀價有很大影響。</p>
<p>印度及中國人對於銀非常愛好，故小康之家大半皆用做蓄財手段而貯藏，據西拉斯氏計算，一九一九年三月末印度民間有三十七億二千九百萬盎斯，其後每年皆有輸入，現在至少已有四十二億盎斯以上，中國銀保有額也有二十五億盎斯以上，其中約一億五千萬盎斯係死藏銀。茲將印度及中國銀純輸入額列表於下：　　年次　　印度　　　中國　　　合計</p>
<p>百萬盎斯　百萬盎斯　百萬盎斯</p>
<p>一九一三年　七一　　　六一　　　一二二</p>
<p>一九一四年　五五　　　丨丨　　　五五</p>
<p>一九一五年　三三　　　丨丨　　　三三</p>
<p>一九一六年　九二　　　丨丨　　　九二</p>
<p>一九一七年　七四　　　丨丨　　　七四</p>
<p>一九一八年　一八○　　二四　　　二○四</p>
<p>一九一九年　一七○　　五三　　　二二三</p>
<p>一九二○年　　三　　　九二　　　九六</p>
<p>一九二一年　五七　　　三一　　　八八</p>
<p>一九二二年　七三　　　五一　　　一○四</p>
<p>一九二三年　一○○　　五○　　　一五○</p>
<p>一九二四年　九二　　　三五　　　一二八</p>
<p>一九二五年　一○一　　九○　　　一九一</p>
<p>一九二六年　九一　　　七三　　　一六四</p>
<p>一九二七年　九○　　　八五　　　一七五</p>
<p>一九二八年　八九　　　一二四　　二一三</p>
<p>一九二九年　八一　　　一三六　　二一七</p>
<p>一九三○年　一○○　　一二六　　二二六</p>
<p>一九三一年　五九　　　六七　　　一二六</p>
<p>從此可見，印度幣制改革後，銀的需要雖逐漸减少；但因銀價低落民間的蓄藏反而增加。</p>
<p>在這種供給過多，需要過少，和世界經濟恐慌日益深刻化的情勢下，銀價暴落是必然的現象，已用不着過於詳細說明；但銀價下落的足跡是怎樣，不妨再列一表以資參考。</p>

<p>三　羅斯福的白銀政策及其影響</p>
<p>上面我們已將銀價低落的原因略作一番檢討了。現在再看羅斯福的白銀政策，是否能够提高穩定銀價以增進國内外貿易，及對於中國將有怎樣影響。</p>
<p>據去年十二月二十二日哈瓦斯通信社紐約電，美參讀員世界經濟會議白銀决議案提案人畢德門，對此次羅斯福總統自山鼓鑄銀幣之决議，於表示熱烈贊成之餘，曾對報界發表談話說：［美國採取此種舉動後，各大座銀國，如加拿大，澳洲，墨西哥，祕爾等均將接踵而起效法美國。……羅斯福將世界銀價安定至每盎斯值美元六角四分半，如是可使中國，印度，墨西哥及南美各國之貨幣購買力與美幣相較增加百分之六十，並可使美國一般購買力增加百分之五十，且與抑低美元價格有同等之效力［。又羅斯福總統在其鑄造銀幣佈告中也說：他自己調查後，覺銀價有提高及穩定之必要，如是方可提高並穩定國内物價，且可增進用銀國之購買力，而保護美國對外貿易，使不受外國幣值低落之不利影響。從上面二引用文中，可見他們相信銀價每盎斯提高至美元六角四分半後，可使中國，印度，墨西哥及南美各國貨幣購買力與美幣相較增加百分之六十，以利美國對外貿易，及可提高並穩定國内物價，和使美國一般購買力增加百分之五十，以克服國内恐慌。但是各大産銀國，如加拿大，澳洲，墨西哥，祕爾等，是否將如畢德門所說將接踵而起效法美國，以及銀價每盎斯是否將長久的穩定於美元六角四分半呢？這是值得硏究的一個問題。我想恐怕將如倫敦金融界的觀察，謂美國收買黄金，幷未能左右世界價格，故此次美國銀政策，或將有同樣遭遇。當用銀國與産銀國在世界經濟會議中宣布其白銀出售之恊定時，銀價僅稍漲，但旋卽反動，故今後情形當亦如是。蓋美國投機家所存現銀，約有一萬五千萬盎斯急於售脫；雖去年銀産額僅爲一萬六千萬盎斯，較諸過去十年平均數减少八千萬盎斯，然世界積存之現銀固甚多也。及紐約華爾街方面的意見，以爲此種新貨幣政策，對於提高銀價未必能立卽發生顯著之效果；蓋太條銀除美國政府所收藏者外，存貨總數約違一萬○五百萬盎斯之多，此外美國産銀，僅占全世界白銀生産額六分之一，且依照倫敦白銀恊定，印度每年得在世界市塲售出白銀三千五百萬盎斯，而印度私人藏銀總數約七千五百萬盎斯，更不受恊定之約束，總計印度存銀達四萬二千二百七十八萬八千盎斯（據我們上面所引西拉斯氏的計算實不止此數）。一九三一年末，上海存銀曾達一萬九千零九十三萬四千盎斯。倫敦白銀恊定，雖規定中國不得鎔毁銀幣；但在中國大批使用之銀錠，其價在一兩至五兩者，則不在限制之列。此種銀錠，最近數月中因預料銀價將有漲勢，運往美國出售者，多至三千萬盎斯。由是觀之，美國銀價提高之傾向，或因外國銀貨大批侵入及最近美國國内對於白銀之劇烈投機而遭停頓亦未可知。從此可見美國政府欲維持比較長久的穩定六角四分半之銀價，除非禁止外銀輸入不可。但這樣又必失去世界的效力，無補於實際。所以欲永久恢復銀價，只有全世界諸主要國家一致恢復金銀兩中位制，及克服當前的世界經濟恐慌，使用解增加，才能達到目的。人爲的抑低或提高價格，歷史已經告訴我們，只不過是一時的興奮劑，是决不會長久的。</p>
<p>倫敦白銀恊定，得印度及美國之批准，似已確立其基礎。就使本年四月一日以前各簽字國都能够全部批准並付諸實行，而提高銀價，那也不過是四年的期間。在四年以後，這一鎖鍊一被切斷，從各國國庫中流出大批白銀於市塲，必更釀成比現時更低的價格無疑。</p>
<p>然現在就使丢開四年後的事情不說，單說羅斯福的白銀政策及倫敦白銀恊定，假定它能够提高銀價，那末對於中國將有怎樣影響呢？首先第一我們可以看見，銀價提高後，中國必更受用金國貨物輸入傾銷之侵略，同時另一方面又必然招來中國輸出激减。在這種入超較大的情况下。中國因爲缺乏金貨償付决濟差額，勢非輸出大量的銀貨不可；於是結果必然不可避的使中國國内銀行及紙幣流通額收縮，而引起銀行及商店之破産，和促進中國農村經濟之急速度的崩潰。其次我們可以看見，中國的存銀將因海外銀價騰貴之激制而大量流出，惹起中國金融之恐慌。又政府的財政收入，因海關收入的金銀算換額减少，也必激减而瀕於危機無疑。從此可見羅斯福的白銀政策及倫敦白銀恊定，實不過是美帝國主義企圖將恐慌的負担轉嫁於東方用銀諸國特别是中國的一種政策。故在現時世界經濟恐慌物價普遍低落各國一致實行通貨膨脹的情勢下，我們寗願銀價低落，而不願如羅斯福及倫敦白銀恊定那樣人爲的提高銀價。</p>
<h3 id="c230">蘇省田賦整理大綱 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>蘇省田賦之應如何整理，本刋第四十八期已言其槪要。茲據報告，蘇財廳對於各縣田賦整理工作，已定有完善之整個計劃，分縣逐步實行。而其所定計畫，可與本刋前文相參閱，故爲錄於後。想亦留心蘇財政者所注意也。</p>
<p>（一）查編田賦徵册　田賦最大之病原，卽在於無田賦圖册，缺乏徵收田賦之根據，自魚鱗册散失以後，各縣徵收官吏，均無各戸實徵底册可憑，僅憑留存之簿册，按戸追收，非假乎於書吏不可。田賦中一切弊端之根本　結，卽在於此。故先决問題，卽在於如何查得完備之田賦圖册，如何得到花戸册内之業戸姓名，關於此點，其治本辦法，當然爲實行淸丈，淸丈以後，可得完備圖册，各項問題，均得迎刃而解。然淸丈一點，時日旣長，費用甚巨，决非短期内所可辦到。在未淸丈以前，其查編田賦圖册方法，於各縣之中，就其未辦淸丈而册籍散失之區域，先行舉辦土地查報，或厲行普遍推收，由區鄉鎭長會同册書負賣辦理，並調集原有糧册，互相核對，　編戸領坵册，以爲目前徵糧之根據。</p>
<p>（二）整理田賦附稅　蘇省田賦附稅之繁雜，盡人皆知。人民對田賦之感受痛苦，亦以附加稅爲最甚。各縣任意加征，名目繁複，用途各殊。統計全省附加稅名目多至一百零五種，附稅之超過正稅，亦有至十餘倍以上。雖其中有正稅太低，以致附稅特别顯明高重者，然其繁而且雜，自無可諱言。人民不苦於正稅，而苦於附稅，附稅不能担負，連正稅亦不能繳納，影響省庫收入，尤爲重大。故整理田賦，目前亟應進行者，卽整理各縣附加稅。附加稅整理之方法，約有下列四點：㈠統一名稱，將各縣五花八門之附加稅名目，按其性質，分别歸併，另定百分支配比例，在串票上只應有省稅縣稅兩種名稱。㈡審核用途，現在分組進行，由廳組設地方預算審查委員會，召集各該縣縣長，切實審核其附加作途。㈢核减稅率，與審核用途同時進行，將各縣附加稅率過重者，嚴加核减，以輕人民負担。嗣後嚴禁各縣任意增徵附加稅捐。以上各項已在積極進行，聞以三個月爲整理完成之期。</p>
<p>（三）改良徵收制度　改善徵收制度，實行嚴厲稽核，爲田賦自前改進之要着。人民能明瞭納稅手續，則不致爲書吏所朦詐，官方能稽核徵收，則書吏不致虧吞稅欵，金庫制度能嚴厲實行，則稅欵可以按期解庫。聞整理各縣田賦急應進行者，如限令各縣公告各則田地科則，廢除銀米，改徵國幣，改善田賦納稅手續，改革串票，厲行業戸直接繳糧立法等項，</p>
<p>以上各項整理步驟、聞均係就第一期初步整理時期之各縣而言，其已在淸丈各縣，均將進行其第二期整理辦法，惟聞第二期計劃中，對於各縣實行田地淸丈，舉辦登記，及估定地價等項工作，與地地局有密切關係，將由財廳與省土地局合作進行，取密切聯絡之步驟也。</p>

<p>（續第五十四期）</p>
<p>㈢設備問題</p>
<p>講到設備，當然大學院，專門學校，都應該有相當的設備。古語說道：［工欲善其事，必先利其器］。這個原則，誰都不能反對。但是我們貧乏的國家，主持敎育事業的人，對於設備的標凖問題，也不有不降格以求。要曉得我們設備的目的，是爲敎授，是爲研究，所以設備的標凖，只要能敎授，能研究，就算了。極端的講一句，譬如要做培養細菌的工作，若是學校貧乏，得不到許多好孵卵箱，就是用熱水瓶來替代，也不見得做不成。譬如要做保留細菌現狀，不敎他發育，若是學校貧乏，得不到許多好冰箱，就是用幾隻木板箱，裏面放點木屑糠屑，再裝入點冰塊，也可以權代冰箱，對於遏止細菌的發育，也有相當的成績，不見得做不成功。這種窮相活現的研究工作，在我們貧乏的國家當中，應該有相當的提倡價值。我上他一個徽號，呌做［刻苦研究］，恰巧模仿衛生工作，和我上文已經說過的［刻苦衛生］相對立。所以我以爲對於醫學校的設備問題，只要求其可以敎授，幷且可以做得來研究工作就算了。若是爲了培養細菌，沒有錢買得許多好孵器，就是熱水瓶也行，若是爲了遏止細菌發育，沒有錢買得許多好冰箱，就是木板箱也行，至於萬萬不可缺不可代替的器物，當然是不可不備的。用這種主張，這種心理，這種計劃，去發展我國醫事敎育和醫學研究，那末我們的窮乏國家，方才有希望了。若是違反了這個主意，把整個國家經濟狀况忘却了，把自己的身體生在窮乏國家中當百姓的命運忘却了，糊裏糊塗，齷裏齷齪，脅肩諂笑的，弄到一點銅錢，就大擺大摇起來，自已坐着汽車，就瞅不起黄包車，看見坐了羊角車的人們，就不當他是人，自己用了熱水汀，就看見炭盆，不當他是東西，這不但心地見識和器量，不可爲訓，簡直說一句，是不願意窮乏的我國，醫育有所發展。抱這種主張的人，不若是别有作用，必定是神經有點錯亂的了。若是單單爲了敎授起見，使得學生見廣識大，免得被人家當做小家庭出身，那是更有辦法，只要多買幾種樣品的本子，把圖案一五一十說給學生聽，也就够了。再不然，領到各處去見識見識也够了。至於畢業以後，要到什麽地方去工作，那時工作的範圍，必有限定的方面，對於這限定的範圍裏面，所用的器械和手技，臨時學起來，少則幾個點鐘，多則兩三日，都可以學得，並不是醫學前途的大障礙。非明窗凈几不讀書，非良筆美紙不習字，這種人一定不是佳弟子，倒是養成了驕奢習氣，一出校們，到了窮乏的社會上去，是很容易失望灰心的吓。！但是我雖作此論，而對於學校，主張有得考究只管去考究，不過不要對於弄不到錢而無可考究的都一筆抹煞，一齊打倒，並且不要忘了扶助他們，使他們進步。</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>丨焦易堂的辭職丨</p>
<p>上星期各報，載有南京電息，大致道［十二日立法委員會議，委員焦易堂彭養光，因爲他們提出的國醫館條例遭受反對，不待會議終了，憤然退席，卽遞呈辭。］又息：［焦所擬國醫館條例中，館長簡任，科長委任各職，儼若衙署之組織，有人以駢枝機關，不應再設，起而反對，當由孫科主席付表决，結果以四十二權對十權否决，焦遂挾皮包逕出會塲，卽與彭養光同繕遞辭呈。］後來各報又載道：［焦彭兩委員，經孫院長的挽留，並允將國醫館條例重付審查，已打銷辭意］國云云。</p>
<p>根據以上的事實，已經足以將焦易堂的思想，見識，人品，學問，活畫出來，他那種一辭一銷的情形，宛然是撒嬌模樣。而且他自兼的國醫館長，必須要弄一個簡任職頑頑。</p>
<p>立法院是國家五院之一，就是五分之一的國事都靠這個會議來解决，並不是專門討論國醫的所在，焦氏因爲一案的不合私意，就挾皮包出會塲，那麽打算置其餘的責任在何地？置國事於何地？會議的表决，少數不服從多數，而能任意走出會塲，恐怕各種會議的委員，個個可以跑完，還有什麽事可議？以國家立法，交與這種人手裏，試問糟科不糟！</p>
<p>世界的醫學，已經趨向到大同，中國的醫界名稱，是不是應該用國醫二字來硬與西醫對峙，明白人早已不消說得，最近汪精衛先生的談話說得好：［醫，旣然要分出國醫與西醫來，那麽軍·也要分出拿大刀的國軍和拿機槍的西軍來了！所以只有科學的醫，與非科學的醫之分别，不應該另定什麽國醫的名目！］這一番話，透澈到十二分，而已得大多數人的同情，就是此次立法委員的否决國醫條例，也許就是汪先生一語破的之功，所以焦氏纔發了急了。</p>
<p>焦易堂對於國醫館，這樣的忠心，倒底不知他葫蘆裏賣些什麽藥，有人說他是另有政治作用，有人說他是不明白大勢的愚忠，然而就算照他告國人書裏的口氣，說什麽保存國粹，抵制外貨，也不過和義和團的［扶淸滅洋］一樣動聽。可惜而今的國事，要經過會議的制度，否則焦氏也只要如當年的端華肅順，矇蔽了西太后一人，倒可以將國醫館切切實實幹一個痛快呢。</p>
<p>焦氏的撒嬌法，已經發生了効力已經得到挽留的面子，其實還不算忠於國家，最好再來一次尸諫，索性留一封遺書給立法院長及其他委員，預料必能將國醫條例安然照辦，也省得紆廻曲折，來得付審查了。好在義和團要殺洋人，所以有八國聯軍來解决，而端肅才獲罪。國醫國醫並不傷洋人毫髮，當然沒有外人來干涉，我願保他非但不至於，戮屍也許還要受香花供養，成爲萬家生佛咧，</p>
<h3 id="c237">送别西裝後 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>因爲我的舍西（西裝）服中（中裝），很引起一般人的注意，雖然我的那篇［送别西裝文］，半含有遊戲的性質，但是了可以說得是我個人一種的覺悟，和對於親友們的宣傳，淳於髠莊周之倫，往往在滑稽中合有諷喻的意味，我的那篇文章，最低限度，也不可謂毫無目的的了！</p>
<p>我改穿中裝以後，已經有一個多月了！在這很短的時間以内，當然談不到有若何的成績，但是在衛生方面却已受到牠的利益了！我穿西裝十餘年來，每到冬令是時常地鬧着傷風的，雖然並不像一般人的拖鼻涕，鬧咳嗽，然而就這種輕微的傷風，總感覺到一種不適。自從舍棄西服改穿中裝以後，日期雖則很短，而冬令傷風的毛病也就跟着西裝别我而去了，至於身體上的温暖與舒適，也著實給我一種很好的印象！朔風凛冽的馬路上，似乎也並不覺得怎樣過度的難受。而一般領窄袖硬自以爲美觀的朋友們，一種縮瑟的樣子，自我觀之，有彼一時此一時之感呢！</p>
<p>我個人改穿中服後的經過是如此，至於我的學生們呢？從前也都是穿西裝的佔十分的七八，我是改穿中裝了！經我的幾度勸告以後，大部分已經改着中服了！他們從前也同我一樣鬧着冬令傷風的毛病，現在呢？也同我一樣的送别了這可惡的傷風了。從衛生方面講來，中國衣服，不能說是毫無益利的了！</p>
<p>慚愧得很，我的送别西裝的兩個宗旨丨丨提倡衛生和挽回利權，頭一項總算有了成績了！第二項則很難說，因爲我個人和我的許多學校裏的同學，力量究竟很小，杯水車薪，似乎無濟於事，這是要望愛國同胞加以一種提倡的啊！　　天下的事，利害相因，中裝的好處，已如上述，但是就沒有一點不便利的地方嗎？這却不然，中裝也有中裝的麻煩，這種麻煩，並不是中裝本身的麻煩，而是因穿中裝而引起的麻煩</p>
<p>中國人有着特别［懼外］與［拜外］的心理，不但眞正的外國人是怕他和崇拜他，就是模倣外國人的中國土産來貨，也同樣的怕他的崇拜他，爲了這一點，穿西裝的朋友，隨時隨地都比穿中裝佔上風得多，尤其是旅行的時候，一到了車站，就可以分别出來了！我從前穿西裝，從來沒有被車站的警察盤查過，現在我的衣服改變了！車站上的警察的態度也改變了！嚴厲的盤問，精密的檢查，彷彿不憚其煩似的，其實我的衣服雖不華麗，却也整齊，那裏知道他們是帶着顔色眼鏡子的呢？因此，我又感覺到彼一時此一時了！</p>
<p>中國人的心理是這樣，中國人穿西裝的心理也是這樣，不幸的中裝，遂不歸得不咎於牠了！</p>
<h3 id="c238">人體腸寄生蟲之危害驅除及預防 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>（慈航助産學校亞洲中學講演稿）蔣本沂</p>
<p>腸寄生蟲病是由腸寄生蟲的寄生而發生的，而腸寄生蟲的種類有這麽多，所以腸寄生蟲病的種類也有這麽多，要是把牠一個一個地寫出來，不但太麻煩，並且不必要。因此這兒只寫幾種常常看見的腸寄生蟲病；並且每一種病的寫述，也只有幾句非常簡單的綱要。讀者</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>要是在這兒找尋高深的材料，那一定會非常失望的，好在這是通俗醫學衛生常識，只要能够把簡單的東西講出來，使一般讀者，從此獲得些人體腸寄生蟲病的智識罷了。</p>
<p>現在把常常看見的幾種最普通的腸寄生蟲病寫在下面：</p>
<p>（甲）蛔蟲病</p>
<p>蛔蟲病在咱們中國非常普遍，大槪有五十％到七十％。明白地說，就是一百人中，有五十到七十人是有蛔蟲病的。</p>
<p>蛔蟲是寄生在咱們小腸裏的圓蟲子。雄的大槪有二百五十粍長，有四粍的横徑；雌的有四百粍長，有六粍的横徑，這種蟲子寄生着的時候，咱們就要發生許多病的症候，最明顯的就是：</p>
<p>一·異味症</p>
<p>有蛔蟲病的人！尤其是小孩子，口味往往跟平常人不同，喜歡吃壁土，庭土，粉筆，線香等平常人從來不吃的東西。</p>
<p>二·胃腸症狀</p>
<p>食慾亢進，或减退，嘔吐，噯氣，口臭，鼓腸，腹痛，營養障碍等。</p>
<p>三·毒性症狀</p>
<p>中毒性症狀，小兒最多。譬如突然發高熱，而起腦膜炎樣的症狀，暉眩，痙攣發作，癲癎發作，神經痛，鼻腔有痒感，聽力和視力障碍，記憶力，减退等。</p>
<p>四·腸穿孔</p>
<p>要是腸子有潰瘍面的時候，蛔蟲往往會把腸壁穿孔，從腸壁裏鑽出來，因此變成急性腹膜尖而死，不過這例子，比較的少見。</p>
<p>五·腸閉塞</p>
<p>要是有很多的蛔蟲團集在腸子裏，不容易出來，那末往往會生蛔蟲迁塞症而死，不過這種例子也是很少見的。</p>
<p>六·其他</p>
<p>蛔蟲有喜歡鑽小孔的性癖，所以有時候往往會鑽到咱們底氣管，鼻腔，涙管，輸胆管裏面去，而發生種種危險的症候。</p>
<p>蛔蟲病，是比較的最常見而不很危險的腸寄生蟲病的一種，可是已經有這麽厲害的病症，其他更不必說，那末對於人體腸寄生蟲是不是有驅除的必要呢？我想假使不是傻子，一定說［要］。現在再說别種腸寄生蟲病。</p>
<p>（乙）十二指腸蟲病</p>
<p>十二指腸蟲是一種寄生在十二指腸裏的小圓蟲，形狀比蛔蟲小得多，雌的有十二到十八耗的長徑；雄的另有六到十耗的長徑。蟲的顔色或者是帶黄白色，或者是類赤色。</p>
<p>十二指腸蟲病最重要的症候是貧血，所以有十二指腸蟲病的人，除了具備跟蛔蟲病差不多的症候以外，最著明的病症就是貧血。當病勢進行的時候，皮膚和粘膜慢慢地蒼白起來，爪甲因貧血的緣故，缺少營養，變成菲薄，容易破碎。牠底表面發現波濤狀的凹凸。心跳，呼吸困難。病勢更進行，就起水腫和出血的傾向。不但這樣，對於神經方面，也起種種病變，最明顯的，就是頭痛，耳鳴，眩暈，不眠症，多夢神經衰弱，腦貧血，癲癎發作，記憶力薄弱等。此外對於發育方面，也大受影響。譬如小兒時代就生了這種病，那未精神發育遲鈍，身體發育惡劣。婦人生了這種病，那末往往會發現月經閉止和流産等。</p>
<p>（丙）蟯蟲病</p>
<p>蟯蟲是一種比十二指腸蟲更小的腸寄生蟲。雄蟲長二粍到四粍，雌蟲長十二粍。</p>
<p>蟯蟲病雖然比蛔蟲病和十二指腸蟲病的危險少得多，不過給牠寄生着的時候，是非常討厭的。牠底最著明的症狀，就是肛門煩癢，尤其是在夜裏睡着的時候，因爲臀部温暖，蟯蟲便從腸子裏爬出來，在肛門周圍和會陰部的此膚面上産卵，那時不但使病人煩癢難過；並且無形中給養成了不良的習慣如手淫等。</p>
<p>蟯蟲病的症候，多半是局部的症候。譬如：因蟯蟲的局部刺戟而起的龜腺炎，陰莖勃起精液漏，攝護腺漏陰門炎，白帶，慢性直腸炎等。</p>
<p>（丁）鞭蟲病</p>
<p>鞭蟲病，也是一種非常流行的病，大槪有六十％到七十％。明白地說，就是一百人中有六十人到七十人的糞便中能够找到鞭蟲的蟲卵。</p>
<p>鞭蟲正如牠底命名一樣，像一根鞭子，前體細得像絲，後體比較粗，像一根鞭子的柄。牠底長徑，大有四十到五十粍。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二十四）肺結核（續）</p>
<p>（問）進行中的肺結核，症狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在進行期中，發熱繼續上昇，體重逐漸减少，肺内病變擴大，頰部潮紅，眼内有一種光澤，面色慘白，胸部刺痛，脊前增加，咯痰多量咳出痰中有粘液或膿狀物，咳嗽劇烈，反復咯血，肺内形成空洞。</p>
<p>（問）病人的外觀，有什麽特異之處？</p>
<p>（答）病人有肺癆體質，肋骨的斜度急竣，鎖骨突出，肩胛骨呈翼狀，胸壁因爲肺萎縮而陷沒，脊柱輕度前彎，羸瘦，（因爲脂肪消失，肌肉萎縮之故）心搏動範圍擴大並且昇高。</p>
<p>（問）病人發熱的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）發熱是肺癆病人症狀中最重要的一種。並且病人對於發熱，也非常重視。普通在攝氏表三七丨三八度之間，早晨低降，夕間上昇約零·五度。病勢進行，夕間有昇到三九丨四零度的。這種發熱，呌做消耗熱，最傷病體。</p>
<p>（問）結核病發熱的原因，在乎什麽？</p>
<p>（答）大槪是因爲結核病菌的毒素反應之故。</p>
<p>（問）結核病人除發熱外，還有什麽重要症狀。</p>
<p>（答）還有睡後出盜汗的症狀。</p>
<p>（問）病人咳嗽的狀態怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）肺癆病人的咳嗽以乾咳，微咳爲主，早間和晚間咳嗽較爲劇烈。</p>
<p>（問）咯痰的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在肺臟有空洞時，痰量增加；咯出的痰，是粘液性化膿性，而不很粘稠。從空洞中排出的痰，往往成塊狀，又含有血液的很多。</p>
<p>（問）已經患了肺癆病的人，能否免疫？</p>
<p>（答）原發性的肺部病竈，治愈的傾向較大；大都是留着一些枝氣官腺的變化痕跡而停頓起來的。這樣的狀態，到了後來再發的時候，又起新的病竈時候，却成了慢性而緩和的經過了。總之，在初回發病時，病人已經解到一點比較的免疫，所以到了再發的時候，能够這樣輕緩。</p>
<p>（問）肺結核預防方法，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）第一，是隔離：凡患開放性。肺結核的人，因爲他的咯痰中含有結核菌，應該把他隔離起來以免傳染到他人。乳兒最容易染病，又多危險；所以必須嚴密隔離。第二，病人咳嗽切勿對人面部，用布巾覆口，最爲重要。第三，咯痰，務必吐在痰盂中。其中放少許消毒藥液，像石炭酸水，來索爾水，石灰水等。第四，衣服應當行蒸汽消毒，日光消毒。第五，住宅病室，都要得到充分的日光，暢通空氣。掃除時，不要用掃帚以免灰塵飛揚開來。第六，結婚有夫婦間互相傳染之虞，婦人姙娠和娩産，都有危險，應注意。第七，營養，要充分供給，謹防感冒。</p>
<h3 id="c240">肺病預防之實施 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>凡疾病之發見愈早，則治愈之希望愈多，此人人而知者也，語有之云，上工醫未病。故吾人理想中之醫學最高峯，乃屬於預防疾病之工作。迨病發而施療治，抑亦末矣。</p>
<p>然在臨床實騐上，則有許多疾病，當其初起，痛苦殊鮮，必俟病勢增進，始感痛苦而求醫治，如心臟腎臟癌腫梅毒等症皆是，而要以肺病（肺結核）爲尤甚。以余壓年觀察來院就診之肺病患者，大抵爲已失去［正當治療時機］，以致病勢激進，始急迫求治者。此種患者，其體力大抵衰弱不堪，故於治療方面，極感困難。倘能於其初起時，卽加以治療，則事半功倍，其治療成績之優越，可斷言也。但以我國人民智識之幼穉，及對於疾病常識之缺乏，而欲望其能早期治療，是不啻責目盲者以視物之同爲不可能也。故於此惟有恃吾醫者之努力，在病人自以爲健康之時，卽施以檢查，方可達早期治療之目的，而亦卽肺病預防之實施也。</p>
<p>肺病爲傳染病，倘能早期治療，則易於撲滅，與公共衛生，社會健康，所關甚大。惟其早期檢查，甚爲困難，若祗行打診聽診，於初期之肺病，實不足以盡診斷之能事，其最可恃之早期診斷方法，非用愛克司光詳細檢騐，不能洞見其癥結之所在也。</p>
<h3 id="c241">Ｘ光對於自認健康者檢查之結果 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>吾人對於自認健康者，施行Ｘ光檢查，則屢可見其肺内石灰化之病灶及肋膜硬結肺瘢痕等，此種均爲不進行性病，患者約占百分之六至百分之十，而尤以六十歲以上老人爲多。但此種不進行性之肺病，患者雖一時痊愈，往往仍有復發而變爲進行性肺病之虞。</p>
<p>其次則可檢得一切肺病自初期浸潤以至極重篤之開放性等之進行性肺病，大都自十五歲至六七十歲，患此種進行性肺病者，以白勞寗博士Ｂｒａｕｎｉｎｇ之統計，約爲千分之五至千分之十，而此種患者，其始皆自以爲肺部乃絕對健康者也。</p>
<p>在外觀健康，而患有肺病或有開放性肺病者，多不自知，蓋其病象極微，固不易引起其注意也。但吾人對此不自覺性之肺病患者，則不能不加以重視，蓋若能早期發見之，一方可爲早期之治療，而一方可爲傳染之預防也。、</p>
<p>余嘗見體育家顧拯來氏，體極强健，初不知其肺部有若何之病變，但當一二八之役，氏因服務保衛團，積勞過甚，致肺病劇發。又光華大學體育指導員某君，無錫人，體格亦健碩逾恒人，因劇烈運動，而起咯血。此在Ｘ光上，均可檢得其病灶。故對於平日自以爲健康之人，卽對於不自覺性之肺病，若能施行Ｘ光嚴密之檢查，則肺病之發見者愈多，而隱蔽者愈少。換言之，卽病人自己尙未發覺，而其病灶已爲吾人所洞見，則於治療及預防二者，所關甚大，此卽施行Ｘ光檢查之佳良結果，而亦卽肺病預防實施之初步也。</p>
<p>總之，肺病之不自覺期，爲時甚久。吾人理想中之肺病預防必要辦法，祗有將全體民衆每年舉行Ｘ光總檢查一次至二次，俾病人於毫無痛苦時，檢出病灶，而早期撲滅之。但此舉於實際方面，施行極感困難。卽欲設法使各團體如學校機關工廠軍隊等處，分别施行檢查，而在我國衛生行政現時情狀之下，恐亦未易爲力。卽使能達到此種總檢查之目的，亦祗全體健康民衆之一小部份而已。換言之，此種Ｘ光總檢查，雖極重要，然祗能檢出不自覺性之肺病患者之一部分，其大部分之肺病患者，當在就醫時發現之也。</p>
<h3 id="c242">Ｘ光對於患病者檢查之結果 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>最近賀爾孟氏Ｈｏｌｌｍａｎｎ對於各種患者，用Ｘ光檢查後之統計如下。</p>
<p>診斷　肺病，肺炎　人數八八四，用Ｘ光檢查後，認爲肺結核者，爲二九五人，其屬於開放性者，爲一三七人。</p>
<p>診斷　乾性肋膜炎　人數一一三，用Ｘ光檢查後，認爲肺結核者，爲十六人，其屬於開放性者，爲五人。　　診斷　氣喘，氣管枝炎，肺氣腫　人數一六五人，用Ｘ光檢查後，認爲肺結核者，爲十五人，其屬於開放性者，爲五人。</p>
<p>診斷　流行性感冒，流行時三星期内，診察人數　人數一六三人，用Ｘ光檢查後，認爲肺結核者，爲十四人，其屬於開放性者，爲五人。　　診斷　流行性感冒，不流行時三星期内，診察人數　人數七十三人，用Ｘ光檢查後，認爲肺結核者，爲十四人，其屬於開放性者，爲六人。　　由此而觀，可知潛伏性肺病（肺結核）之多，同時且有開放性肺病存於其間，故其早期診斷，及時治療，於預防染傳，直與不自覺性肺病之早期檢出，同屬重要，而爲吾人所不容忽視者也。　　但當病人初診之時，自覺之症狀極微，頗難鑑别，卽病者有相當程度，而打診聽診，亦不可恃，非用Ｘ光檢查，實難得眞確之診斷。然多數醫師，未必盡有Ｘ光之設備，因此而致貽誤者，勢所不免。此匪僅我國爲然，卽醫學發達如歐美各國，亦恐有之。</p>
<p>蓋肺病初起，大都徵象甚微，或竟毫無痛苦，且其病狀又往往與他種疾病相類似，故易於誤認也。</p>
<p>但吾人爲實施預防計，若不能將此等不自覺性及潛伏性肺病，及早檢出而撲滅之，則肺病之蔓延，將何法以遏制之。故預防肺病，雖以早期診斷，施行治療於未發病之時，最爲有效，而早期診斷，則　Ｘ光檢查外，實無其他更確實之方法也。</p>

<h3 id="c244">漫駡 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 倪朔函</p>
<p>還有一種不滿於批評家的批評，是說所謂批評家好［漫駡］，所以他的文字並不是批評。</p>
<p>這［漫駡］，有人寫作［漫駡］，也有人寫作［謾駡］，我不知道是否是一樣的函義。但這姑且不管牠也好。現在要問的是怎樣的是［漫駡］。</p>
<p>假如指着一個人，說道：這是婊子！如果她是良家，，那就是漫駡；倘使她實在是做賣笑生涯的，就並不是漫駡，倒是說了眞實。詩人沒有捐班，富翁祗會計較，因爲事實是這樣的，所以這是眞話，卽使稱之爲漫駡，詩人也還是捐不來，這是幻想碰在現實上的小釘子。</p>
<p>有錢不能就有文才，比［兒女成行］並不一定明白兒童的性質更明白。［兒女成行］祗能證明他兩口子的善於生，還會養，却並無妄談兒童的權利。要談，祗不過不識羞。這好像是漫駡，然而並不是。倘說是的，就得承認世界上的兒童心理學家，都是最會生孩子的父母。</p>
<p>說兒童爲了一點食物就會打起來，是寃枉兒童的，其實是漫駡。兒童的行爲，出於天性，也因環境而改變，所以孔融會讓梨。打起來的，是家庭的影響，便是成人，不也有爭家私，奪遣産的嗎？孩子學了樣了。</p>
<p>漫駡固然寃屈了許多好人，但含含胡胡的撲滅［漫駡］，却包庇了一切壞種。</p>
<h3 id="c245">旅途斷片 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>如果說旅行的幸福，是在不斷地看見新的景物，得着新的刺激，那麽單以中國邊地這個範圍而言，在雲南西部旅行要算是第一幸福的了，自然，這之間，還要加上一個條件，就是說，不要在路上遇着剪徑的土匪。</p>
<p>雲南西部旅行之所以令人感到興味，而且懷戀不已的，便是有些地方的氣候，會在一天的旅程中，現出兩個國度那麽異樣的狀態，而且有些地方的生活，也會在一天的旅途中，劃出兩個世紀那麽不同的現象。</p>
<p>記得由昆明赴緬甸的那一年，約莫陰曆二月的時分，道經樂豐縣城，上午，看見城外原野中，蠶豆花開，油菜發綠，正是仲春的好時光，而氣候也是怪和煦的。翻過幾個山，在正午的光景，到了名呌小窪的地方（四圍高山，中係小小山谷，）便彷彿另到一個國度一樣，蠶豆葉子已經黄老了，正被農家收割着，陽光熱辣辣地晒人，簡直如同五月初頭時節。四週的樹木，也是蒼綠濃茂的，絲毫沒有春天的氣象了。到人家門前息氣，要水喝，狗却懶得吠人，躺在牆邊，吐着舌頭喘氣。人則裸背，睡在凉蓆上，享受初夏午睡的幸福。屋裏到處充溢着蒼蠅的鳴聲，表現出熱天特有的景色。入暮，至舍資地方，原野雖是已漸漸披上朦朧的夜色了，但春天的花香，和野草的氣味，却是可以嗅得着的。使人到了這兒，彷彿覺得正午消逝了的春天，晚上重又歸來了似的。</p>
<p>在樂豐城的晚上，每間舖面裏，點臭油的洋燈是不缺少的，然而在舍資街上呢，不過相隔一天的路程吧了，燈呵，舖子裏簡直是鳳毛麟角，不說少有用洋燈的，就是使香油燈的，也極不多見。那末，這樣看來，舍資街上的人，好像入夜就閉門睡覺，全不做生意的了。不，相反的，晚上也還熱鬧，而且街上也是通明大亮的。這因爲是每家舖面或住戸，都在壁上釘個鐵盤，放上小條的松明子，（卽松木含有多量松脂的）生起一小團熊熊的火，照耀全室的。走在街上，嗅着松烟的香味，看着如此的異景，追懷遠古的情調，便在旅人的心上，輕輕地浪漾着了。</p>
<h3 id="c246">活猪筏 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>解筏了。</p>
<p>像溜走似的，筏在水面毫無困難的順流而下；除了轉灣或者水淺的地方，不得不用一用竹篙以外，簡直用不到一點人力。</p>
<p>水色深碧，雪落在上面，雖則很輕，像鵝毛着地似的，聽不到一點聲音，可是在融化的時候，却也有水泡，如果仔細看，還可以看出水泡的形狀，圓圓的，彷彿是小魚從水底噴上來的口沫。</p>
<p>兩岸的高山上，雪已積得很厚了。白皚皚的，那樣的耀眼，就是灰黯的天色，也遮掩不了那種鮮潔的光澤。</p>
<p>三張活猪筏連在一起，前前後後，像綫條似的，在深碧的水面飄蕩。</p>
<p>猪呌得非常厲害，寒冷威脅着這些畜生。猪圈上　只蓋着一張竹簾子，四方八面都是空的，除了幾根粗杉木，沒有一點遮欄，雪很容易飄到它們的身上。而且它們又沒有東西吃，整天餓肚，所以那麽尖聲的呌着，不斷的咬着杉木。　　［這些畜生眞該死］！</p>
<p>老筏子憤憤的說，看他那種皺眉鬱臉的神氣，彷彿他從來沒有聽過猪呌。他戴着一頂箬帽，披着一件舊簑衣，一雙又長又大的牛皮靴子，一直穿到他的大腿上面，幾乎把全條褲子都遮掉了。</p>
<p>［我最怕碰到活猪，如果是火腿那就好了，不要說别的，吃也吃得爽快一點］！</p>
<p>於是他就絮絮的講起他撑火腿筏的時候，吃厭了火腿，甚至把肥肉抛到水裏去的事。他說只要你的肚子容得下，就是一頓飯吃掉半隻腿，火腿客人也不會講半句話。而且火腿筏上只有脂肪的，油膩的香氣，絕對沒有使人頭痛的猪呌和猪糞臭。</p>
<p>那糞臭實在是難聞的。雖是在那樣淸爽，那樣遼闊的江面上，那臭氣的刺鼻還是依然，彷彿你把多少浴在肥料裏的猪，關在一間不通空氣的小屋裏一樣。　　［這片筏是不是你自己的］？</p>
<p>我忽然想起來問。</p>
<p>［不，是我們東家的］。</p>
<p>筏子沉默了，他轉過頭去，唯恐我再問他的樣子。聽說這江面的筏，不論大小，全有筏東家。筏子要像黄包車夫一樣，出高價向他租來，條件非常的苛刻。所以這些筏子雖則不問寒暑的在這條江上來來回回，但結果還是不能糊口，更不能養家。</p>
<p>筏順流飄着。</p>
<p>山在兩岸連綿着，有時轉了幾個灣，似乎山脈中斷了，但不久却湧現出更雄偉，更重疊的峰巒。</p>
<p>這一帶村落很少，有也只是疏疏落落</p>
<p>的幾家。我們筏過的時候，因爲聽到猪呌，有許多赤脚的小孩子，從那積雪很原的穿屋中跑出來看。木橋倒很多，過了一條又是一條。</p>
<p>雪不斷是落着，天是灰茫茫的，我們的心情，他像天色一樣的黯淡。現在是新年　我們不能住在温肯的家裏，却要冒着颼雪跟洁猪在這江面旅行，難免有點悽凉之感。</p>
<p>黄昏逼近的時候，筏子把木筏繫在沿岸的枯樹上。在沙灘上，他擇了一塊比較乾燥的地方，搭起一個布蓬子，就在裏面墊上了一點隨筏帶來的稻草，當作床舖。</p>
<p>他生起火來。</p>
<p>猪却尖聲地呌着，咬着杉木，猪糞臭在黑黯中傳播開去。</p>
<p>這樣一直到第二天淸早，再解筏的時候…………</p>
<h3 id="c247">回敎徒不吃猪肉的問題 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 馬憶源</p>
<p>不吃猪肉底經騐，憎厭猪肉底感情，我都有過的。我的外祖對於回敎哲理很有研究，他常常以［體認眞主，誠心嚮善］勸人，大不以徒尙儀式，飾作善人者爲然。我幼小時，一天同他到街上去，遇見一個人提了一掛猪肉迎而闖來，我便急急地拉開他道：</p>
<p>［外爺！快讓呀！］</p>
<p>［什麽？］他不慌不忙地問。</p>
<p>［猪肉來啦！］</p>
<p>［有什麽要緊呢，這樣大驚小怪的。］</p>
<p>原來我們中國的回敎徒不僅不吃猪肉，卽摸觸都是禁忌的。被猪肉闖着了的衣服，浣洗後只能平常着用，不能再拿來上寺做禮拜。記得小時和非回敎的兒童打架，自覺尙稱得驍勇，但一見敵方手持猪油一塊趕來，便中好不戰而敗了！　　我的外祖對於猪肉只主張不吃，自然也不故意去摸觸，無意闖着了猪或猪肉，也認爲接觸了不潔的東西，但一洗卽可；見着猪肉也毋須像對鬼怪般地躱避。我當時不大明白他，只聽着一般阿洪（卽司敎）說他是［敎門不好］，是［外道］　　我的信仰底濃陰現在雖則已被近代的智識之光移消了，但關係回敎或回敎徒底問題，總特别引得起我的興趣，常想站在尊重他人底信仰底立塲上，略爲貢獻些習慣止應　改良的意見。同時也是對於研究社會學宗敎學的人供給些研究資料。本文算得一個發端。</p>
<p>我徧查近來才漢譯的可蘭經和英譯法譯等本，都只載有禁吃猪肉的條文而不及其他對猪底任何禁忌，就是漢文天方典禮底正文也僅有［勿啖豖］，［豕汚］二條。在附註底問答中才有這樣的一問一答；［誠如是說，戒食足矣，何苦於腥膩沾觸之際，疾僻以讐之？曰：此防微杜漸之義，不可不然爾］。</p>
<p>附註底意見是否中國特有，一時未能考知，但下述三次與他國回敎徒底談話，可供大家參考。</p>
<p>第一次我因事到馬賽，便抽暇去訪問埃及領事館底一位信奉回敎的秘書。我說明訪問的意思後，他很表示歡迎，我們便開始以下的問題：</p>
<p>［回敎禁吃猪肉，是否也禁沾觸猪或猪肉？］</p>
<p>［不，禁吃是可蘭經有明文規定，沾觸若被汚損，當然應該浣濯。］</p>
<p>［你在此間膳食是自炊，還是在普通飯店裏就食。］</p>
<p>［自然到飯店去吃，歐洲猪肉較牛肉貴，假使我要一盤小牛肉，他絕不至用猪肉來替代的。我們很可放心。］</p>
<p>［敝國回敎人並禁止摸觸猪或猪肉，衣服經沾觸時，雖浣洗後也不能再在做禮拜時穿着，是否合乎經義？］</p>
<p>［就我所知，可蘭經只有禁食的規定，其餘我便不敢說了。但我知道有一位朝過三次聖地的埃及回敎徒，他應當比我的宗敎智識更豐富，而他作的生意是養猪，養成了便賣與歐洲人。那末他怎能免了摸觸他所養的猪呢。我想恐怕只是不吃就可以了。］</p>
<p>［禁食底理由你能告我嗎？］</p>
<p>［這怕是因爲猪太骯髒，且有毒的關係。况且我們是住在熱帶地面的……］</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c248">父女（三） <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>但是母相是始終沒有回來，而父親說着同樣的話有三年，五年，十年了！</p>
<p>在這些日子裏，她看到父親傷愁而早添了一莖一莖的白髮；父親的健康也因爲縱酒而壞了下去。她想到父親在追憶自己所愛的女人之外，也在想着女兒不久戕要隨着所愛的男人走去。那麽留下他一個人，孤獨地過着殘餘的歲月。於是她就告訴父親，說她絕對不會抛下父親。</p>
<p>［是這樣子麽，是這樣子麽？］</p>
<p>父親用懷疑的眼光望着她，可是他的聲音不知道爲什麽在戰顫着。</p>
<p>［我不說一句假的，誇大的話。］</p>
<p>她記得那時候她是多麽肯定地望着父親的臉，她曾顯出怎樣卓異的樣子來。</p>
<p>［我不願意爲了我的緣故荒蕪了女兒的靑春。］</p>
<p>［可是我願意用我的靑春換取父親快活的日子，只是有一樣，］她頓了頓，［我不願意父親再沉湎在酒中，那會損害你的健康！］</p>
<p>［我答應你孩子。］</p>
<p>於是他們抱起來了，她覺出父親的熱涙淌在她的頸上，她自己也流了涙。</p>
<p>這樣他們度過了一年安順而美好的日子。她常是裝作小孩子，要父親忘記他的老年：她細心地伏侍着他，體貼得像一個忠心的情人。父親常是被感動得像有什麽話要說了，她却卽時岔開了，不要他說下去，她自己却說：</p>
<p>［我是您的女兒，所有的事情都是我應該做的。］</p>
<p>但是近來，父親是又被那舊日的憂鬱所襲繫了。他沒有明白地說出來，也許他在心中想過這是有一點對不起女兒的事；呆是又沒有法子遏制自己；在爲過往的思念所苦的時候，就自自然然地看着懸在墻上的那張肖像。那在他的眼睛裏不只是一張呆板的畫像，憑着他的心念，是可以笑也可以說話的東西了。他記起她的笑是如何地有着兩個可愛的笑渦，說起話來，就使人看見到有多麽好看的牙齒。他還記得在她的眼角那裏是有一顆殷紅的痣的，可是在這肖像上却沒有，因爲是被頭髮遮住了。他還能想起一切她所說過的話，那些空洞的話，憶起時便又像在他的耳邊低低地說着一樣。現在這一切都沒有了，只憑着追想纔能在他的心中閃過一陣淸晰的影子。</p>
<p>長大起來的女兒，有着和母親相同的美麗的面容，還有着一顆那麽好的心。他知道女兒的心是好的，是她的母親所不能比，也是一切的女人所不能比的。每次他這樣想着的時節，就能增加自己的信念，來忘掉那無情的女人；但是因了女兒，他也很容易地想到女兒的母親。他常常想一個人坐在那裏，或是散散步，使舊日的恩情在他自己的心中復活起來。他想避開女兒，因爲他知道這是多少有些對不起她的。</p>
<p>那天晚上他們就默默地坐在那裏，直到疲乏使他們的眼睛覺得枯澀，頭也微微地垂了下去。</p>
<p>［爸，睡了吧，時候已經不早了。］</p>
<p>［是麽？］</p>
<p>他抬起眼睛望望懸在墻上的鐘，已經是十一點二十五分了。</p>
<p>［眞是，快到十二點了，我還覺得纔只有一會兒。］</p>
<p>她故意這樣說了，其實這晚上，她覺得簡直是過了一年！</p>
<p>［好，我們睡覺去，睡覺去。］</p>

<p>我國國格與元氣，先天培養旣不足，後天斷　復努力］，實已弄成百孔千瘡之病夫，背疽剛封口，肚　又流血，誘來無數大綠頭蒼蠅，噏噏噏地在他週身飛繞着，伺機擇肥而噬！此老丨病夫丨一體被叮，甚至又成新瘡而將潰，其餘四體，若不帮忙驅蠅，或助打六百零六和九百十四，其不一體一體地被蠅叮死也幾希丨又如巨浪駭濤中之朽舟，大家合力同心，彌補罅隙，猶恐危局無法撑持，險灘難以渡過；倘若還要各懷貳心，各存私見，明裏暗裏，爭向一艘迎面駛來的卬艦，是將碎已舟，奪玉帛，食血肉的巨艦去吊膀子，你想這舟中人，是不是［頭頂三襟冠丨丨望着死處竄］的貨色？</p>
<p>報載中政會通過内蒙自治辦法十一樣，確是言之成理，不過一廻想到他的大阿哥丨丨外蒙今日之所以無影無踪，起初鬧的也是堂乎其皇的自治；何况今内蒙鬧自治之日益劇烈，適當東北失地巨痛之餘，且值僞組織將易名［滿洲國［，並已西侵察東，佔據趙家營子之際（均見十八日本報），那十一條较法之通過，我們當驚受恐的心靈，痛定思痛的思緒，已因此而惹起了一股熱辣辣，疼刺刺的感覺，好像在疼想着：［那隻兎，恐也快將不在那個窠裏了！］</p>
<p>可是天下之大，怪事眞是無奇不有。上段已經說過，值此國難嚴重，亟應共濟同舟之秋，那十一條自治辦法之通過，賣已覺其是不幸的過分之産物了！不料内蒙各盟旗代表，趙泰保等十四人，猶以爲未足，逕赴中政會，請願維持黄部長在百靈廟商定之原案，卽將自治區政府的職權再加大些（見十九日本報），［否則絕對不敢承受，只有泣血歸蒙，聽候宰割］。其求自治心之如何迫切？反對審查案之如何堅决？吾人可勿置議。讀彼等呈文。語氣似乎極像有一妻一妾之齊人，不幸家道中落，妻已隨姘頭竊逃，妾欲離異而不獲，不禁悻悻然曰：［妻竊逃，汝固無言！今妾正式提出經濟獨立，不，正式與汝謀和平之離異，汝反加以疑阻，何不受抬舉乃爾？］此種惡劣口脗，能不令人仇懣欲死嗎。</p>

<p>— 祖</p>
<p>大約是前四五年的事了吧，是夏天的某日，正是放暑假的前二天，也就是我初中畢業的那個夏天，學期考試已過，心中已快慰了一大半，尤其是與方探聽出了自己的分數是及格的，那是更快樂得無可言喻了。於是結了大隊同學，就到某老師處談談，某先生處坐坐。王老師的斗室全被我們一大隊的同學佔滿了，王老師忽然問起我：［祖，你預備升學嗎？］［升學的］我簡單的回答。［我主張你去進敎會學校。］王老師這樣心直口快地供獻我找學校的意見。［嚇！進敎會學校，想去學些流利的英語嗎？流利的英語又何補於事實呢？當亡國奴，當走狗嗎？還是進國立或省立的學校好。］許先生在驕矜地校正王老師的弱點。［老許，你說的還是進國立或省立的學校好，好求些實際的學問，這又是那裏的話呢？敎會學校所擅長的固然是不甚合乎實際所需要的流利的英語，但是你所說的國立學校和省立學校他們所注意的又是什麽呢？今天擁護這個，明天打倒那個？上半天開什麽自治會，下半天開學生會，其實開來開去開出些什麽花頭來呢？這個誰都不知道呀？其實靑年生活在現在的世界上，眞是難極了，沒有錢求學可繼續升學，，自己暗暗地流涙，而預備了錢去讀書的仍然又是處處感到困難，終於是［流利的英語］，和擁護，打倒，開會］都解决不來靑年麵包的問题呀，］</p>
<p>今天，數年後的今天了。我去參加一個××游藝會，在××游藝會儀式上輪到師長的訓話，有一位中年敎師登臺演講：［………像敎會學校裏禁止學生在校内自由活動，就是有什麽會議亦由敎師命令工地呆板地行着，本校今天××游藝會的成立完全是學生自動，學校方面全只處於旁觀者的地位，所以這精神是可敬可愛的，………］</p>
<p>當他演講完了後，在我的心中掀起了微微的浪化，浮起了無名的暗影。據說這××游藝會，是犧牲了好些學生整個的賓貴求學時間而育成的。學校是一個小社會，在校内除了讀死書以外，當然不反對課外的各種活動，但是所謂課外的活動，當然也應該有相當的限止，假使幹了些隨便什麽的鬼把戲，祇要地點是在學校以内的，就算是學校裏的課外活動，這總是很滑稽的。但是我始終認爲在幼小的時候，除了應該活潑些以外，好好地指導他們養成讀書習慣，這也是當敎師者應當的任務。</p>
<h3 id="c251">莫單取笑别人 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 何處去</p>
<p>西洋人拜着上帝，印度人拜着大神，回回人拜着活佛，中國人拜着祖先。不論這上帝，大神，活佛，祖先是死的是活的，是虚構的，是實有其人，是有偶象的，或是沒有偶象的，總之都是種偶象崇拜，都是種在實生活裏遇到了因境而求助於那或有或無的超人的神力來解救自己的存心，這其間要說軒輊之分是沒有的。</p>
<p>有些人信仰着上帝，於是而嘲笑着回回人，說他們那種崇拜是愚蠢的，是荒唐的，這正和着中國人之嘲笑西洋人之崇拜上帝，上帝的崇拜者之嘲笑着中國人的崇拜着祖先是一樣可笑的。</p>
<p>在戲幕裏看着滑稽角的表演固然是好笑的，然而這般發笑的觀衆未必就不是滑稽一種捧着生菜咬着的人們而嘲弄着活魚的生咬者，是不見得着實高明，也不見得便比後者文明一等的。</p>
<p>人們總覺得自己的便是好的。穿着西裝的便笑穿着袍套的，穿着袍套的便笑着穿西裝的人。但是冷眼旁觀起來，究竟那種又不是可笑的呢？</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>經濟危機日益深刻的現在，一般民衆的［命運］，若不自己起來積極的與以支配；便是［命運］來支配你，註定被恐慌的浪潮捲沒到饑餓線下，這已經是不待筮之著龜便［毫無疑義］。但是有許多人却不明乎此，想在整個社會的大衆均趨於貧困破産自殺與被殺的激蕩中，自己成爲［幸運見］，於是便齋戒沐浴，求神拜佛，希圖在神天庇祐之下，得要［財神菩薩］的來臨。這一種社會末期的現象，很足以表示一般人民對現狀［不勝憤懣］的消極態度，但亦是他們僥倖苟安的懦弱心理。這一種懦弱心理，正如僧伲和尙之利用爲鞏固神的［意旨］自己則大撈其錢一樣，亦爲社會統治者利用以［國家興盛］［民族前途］爲符咒，自己則大發其財。此其犖犖大者。至若在此上行下效的風氣下，商店公司飯食店也用［有×萬元的希望］來招致，實行其［虧本克己］的生財大道，則汗牛充楝，不勝贅言。</p>
<p>所以，我們現在抽香烟可以得奬，洗肥皂可以得奬，最近連在南京路日昇樓吃湯　也可得奬，若花上十只孫大頭來［熱心救國］可以希望成爲五十萬富翁，更是衆所周知的事。這說明我們中國在世界上雖爲極貧的國家，［財神菩薩］却遍地皆是，只要你［祖宗有德］，就可財星照臨。可是據十三日國民社電：美國也戕仿照我國辦法，决定發行國家奬劵了，這更使我們有［吾道不孤］之感。　　美國自羅斯福以挽救危機救濟失業作號召在複選勝利走馬上任之後，喧騰一時，白宮談話，倫敦會議，通貨膨脹，實業復興，再再都找到一服［仙丹］來一起資本制喥病入膏肓的沈疴。可是有些事違人願，蓋鷹旗幟雖飄揚於全國，直到現在幾於一年，失業人數仍然有一千多萬，市塲仍然不見怎樣繁榮，在通貨膨脹物價提高的情况下，市塲反而縮减，所謂産業復興美國，更有［前途茫茫］之歎。於是這一楊基人種命運之神的羅斯福，心勞日拙，漸漸在人民熱望［找工作，要麵包吃］的失望下，失去他的信仰。因此聰明的羅斯福便來一［金蟬脫殼一之計，使一般人民對挽救危機救濟失業之絕望不歸責於己，在饑餓的掙扎下，給他們以致富之機丨發行國家奬劵。於是成千，成萬呻吟於饑寒交迫的失業羣衆，揑緊肚子等侯［財運］的來臨，再不致鋌而走險，闖入過激的道路，國家太平，天下無事。是以所謂［國家］［復興］××奬劵之風盛一時，在這廣大民衆陷於極度貧困的現在，不出下述二個意義：</p>
<p>第一，由社會經濟制度之不健全而造成經濟危機以及人民的失業窮困，</p>
<p>第二，人民受失業破産之賜，幾乎除了赤手空拳之外，再不能用直接稅間接稅的形式在他們身上刮到什麽，</p>
<p>在此我們不妨重複的提醒希望［財運］降臨人們的警惕，在此經濟危機浪潮捲蕩世界的時候，你們的［命運］是山經决定了，不是爲［國家民族］多揮幾滴汗涙，便是爲［祖國］効身疆塲以作砲灰，所謂國家奬劵以及甚麽奬劵也者，正是引導你們走上這一路途的［蒙汗藥］丨若是自己不勇敢起來支配自己［命運］的話。</p>

<p>在現下的時代，有兩種人可以做人；其一，是資本家闊老的公子哥兒；其一，是吃賭飯，開窑子，做投機，開銀行的朋友；此外不要說起，委實難以做人！開廠，開店嗎？捐稅重重，放賬難收，夥計難用，房租昻貴：勉强敷衍，上上大吉；關門倒閉，不能怨天。這確是目下中國的現象，所以開廠開店，不是［生意經］。到學校讀書嗎？小學中學不要說起，大學畢了業，找一個六元月薪的練習生，也不容易辦到。况且讀書要有本錢，不比從前［平地一聲雷］，［白屋出公卿］。要是你老人家來頭大，路數闊，何妨捧着二只，三只，四只，五只……飯盌，否則任你天大本領，博學多能，沒有人來請敎，連半只飯盌，也不許你捧。所以讀書也不是［生意經］。做夥計，吃人家飯嗎？第一先要有門路，有了薦，還要保。薦保舒齊了，還要懂處世的門檻，勤勞耐心，要緊；識相拍馬；更要緊。要是你老人家照了舊道德的信條，甚麽禮，義，廉，恥，公正，去做人，保你處處碰壁，事事窒礙。新時代有新道德，難道熟讀修身敎科書的朋友，便適應於現代社會嗎？所以做夥計，吃人家飯，也不是［生意經。那末，什麽是括括呌的［生意經］呢？我以爲要在這黑暗徬徨的生活歷程中殺出一條血路來，便是快快摹倣探險新大陸的哥崙布！</p>
<p>現代靑年的呼聲，充滿着黯澹悽慘空氣的裏面。一切的刋物，都有悽慘呼聲的發出。其實，根本錯了丨假如請諸位在水門汀上告地狀，坐汽車的大人先生，難道跳下車來而施你嗎？在刦物上告地狀，其有何異！這些窮措大的寒酸文字，難道爲跳入大人先生的眼簾嗎？所以徒然做這些文章，不如自覺新地。</p>

<p>賈長沙的痛哭文章，屈靈均的行吟澤畔，不獨不打動君主的心坎，便是沉汨自殺，也是［屈死］吧了！</p>
<p>怎樣自覓新地呢？來打一名賭徒的術語道：呌做［打冷門］。人家都奔都市，我來奔田間。雖說農村破産，畢竟牧蓄，樹藝，販賣，可做的事很多很多。况且農村生活低，日光足，空氣好，人心比較良善，把酒桑麻，不問治亂，農村可做的事很多，難道只有都市一條路可走嗎？話要說了回來，都市未嘗不可走。第一擇業，倒要小心，不可不審愼。要是［人生的眞諦］，是在掙錢；那末，你老人家不能够追隨都市上的闊老；也須交接白相朋友，神而明之存乎其人，不難自［抖］起來的一日。否則，一肩舊貨擔，幾攤負販舖，克勤克儉，也還不致於挨餓。否則欺詐拐騙，偷盜擄掠，把女兒去做舞女，明星，鹹肉，兒子拾香烟屁股，拉黄牛過橋，搶馬龜，剝猪　，吃俸禄，開賭壺，也足以在上海灘上做［老太爺］。這些都是［冷門］也是哥倫布探着的新地！</p>
<p>閑言少說，書歸正傳。宇宙雖窄，噉飯究竟有地，千萬别隨俗淨沉，應該略用腦經，來打［冷門］，在刋物上告告地狀，是沒有用的。同時，各刋物的主編先生，曷勿把賓貴的篇幅，多登小實業小工藝等新穎實用稿件，使徬徨歧路的靑年，殺出一條生路來，不是比較有裨益嗎？</p>

<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>賣笑，通常是指的以皮肉供人娛樂的妓女，丨實際上的意義，已不是這兩　所能包容丨但也有用作本義爲止的。　　在去年十二月二十七日報上，曾有如下一條新聞。</p>
<p>世界新聞社倫敦訊：皮丹斯盤琳姑娘，爲全世界以［笑］賺取生活之女子，彼恐其倩笑一旦失衰，故保有笑險一千鎊。彼每星期須裝笑五十回，任各種新聞紙及雜誌攝取其肖影。彼近告人云；［我之笑，爲我最可賓貴之財産，不可失之，故保險千鎊。我有時倦於作笑，則直坐我之汽車，滅蹤遠出，數十日始歸耳］。</p>
<p>初讀這新聞，似乎覺得皮丹斯盤琳姑娘必是異常的高貴，有值得保險一千鎊的價值。但仔細一想，這情形却是十分可悲的。</p>
<p>笑是情感之極則，須是由衷的丨換句話說就是無所爲丨固不問你是［宛爾］或是［絕倒］，在内質上總有一個非笑不可的理由。我們不能强哭者以歌，正如不能强歌者以哭一樣。笑而於［裝］，已完全失去了［笑］的意義，實際上已與哭相近，丨或更過之。尋常所謂［倚門賣笑］云云，這不過是受主一方面的觀察罷了，在［賣］的這一方面看來，該是［淚］，是［血］。筵前的笑語，每流爲枕上的淚痕，幾曾在烟花塲中找得出一絲眞實的歡愉來！以他人的血，涙，供自己的笑資，人類是永遠這樣地殘酷的。皮丹斯盤琳姑娘的自驕，正顯得他的更可憐處。</p>
<p>但話又說回來了，以［笑］賺取［生活］，終究是一樁容易而又受人歡迎的事丨只要你不想起你是一個人，一個具有獨立人格的人來丨一般朝夕伺候於大人先生之門，以他人的喜怒爲喜怒的人，［生乎今之世］，幾到處皆是，固不只是皮丹斯盤琳姑娘的獨行。這一類人，也如皮丹斯盤琳姑娘一樣，昻然自得的奉　最可實貴之財産］丨笑丨如恐失之，却絲毫不覺得自己的可悲處。關於這一種的賣法，是該與　社會的迫害不得已而操皮肉生涯的賣笑婦，又當别</p>

<p>你又根據我的話說，</p>
<p>［他這樣的頽廢下去，我不能够害他，我還是離開他的好！］</p>
<p>［你要離開？到那裏去？］我是多麽驚訝的喲！</p>
<p>［我回我母親的地方去，丨可是我是逃婚出來的人，我又不願意回去！我是一個孤苦伶仃的人，就是要離開他，也是沒有路可走的呵！…］你說着放聲哭起來了！</p>
<p>你實在可憐，但敎我如何安慰你呢？我能够鼓勵你去找獨立的生活嗎？我不能够。因爲人傑是我的朋友，而且他是愛你的。我當時安慰你的話是多麽不着邊際的呵，我說，</p>
<p>［人傑不過是近來性情才變的吧了，他是很好的有爲的靑年，你不應該離開他，你一離開他更是害他了，他將不知道要頽廢到什麽地步呵！］</p>
<p>你默着。我也覺得沒有什麽話可說。</p>
<p>不一回，人傑回來了，他還是那樣的頽唐，同時又是發牢騷式的說話，我一提起他的頽廢丨和不顧生活的話，他却英雄氣槪十足地否認，我也只有帶譏刺地說他不頽廢就好了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，他跑到我那裏去，一進門就瘋狂似地大笑，這自然是［反常］，我十分詫異而憂愁。憂愁的是，一定是你離開他了，你離開他這事，我是知道的，但我沒有告訴他。假如我先告訴了他，他或者可以改變他的舉止，並且向你懺悔而得到你的諒解，那不是沒有事了嗎？那不是使他不至於那樣的瘋狂嗎？我後悔了，這是我的罪過！可是已經來不及了，你是離開他了，他是瘋狂了！天喲，我是一個罪人！</p>
<p>他瘋狂地哈哈大笑，好久才說出這麽一句話，</p>
<p>［我的曼麗，她，離開我，走了！］</p>
<p>說着又哈哈地大笑，倒在椅背上，兩隻漲血的眼睛膛看天花板。忽然間維我一個不提防，從椅子上站起，兩手抓住我的衣領大呌着，</p>
<p>［你看，我們的人生，就註定是演的悲劇嗎？］</p>
<p>他的遭遇，我是同情，他說這話，又正敲中了我的心弦，丨我也是在人生的路上演的悲劇呵！我那時又那裏能够安慰他呢？我也正正需要人們來安慰我的呵！</p>
<p>［我們的前途是沒有出路，我們的思想被毒蛇咬住，我們的情感有如火山在爆發，可是連自己的愛人都不能够給我一點安慰，我們，］他悲哀地慘呌着，［我們難道就已經走上墳墓之路了嗎？我們難道就注定應該自殺的嗎？］</p>
<p>我除了抱住了他在撫慰之外，我有什麽話可以安慰他呢？</p>
<p>［不行，不行！］他又慘呌着，［我們並非弱者，我們也不是混蛋的人，我們得趕上時代的前面，我們得爲有意義的犧牲而死，我們不能够自殺；自殺是弱者的行爲，自殺是可恥的行爲！…女人，女人女人是魔鬼！可是，…］他的聲音又變成輕微無力的了，［我愛她呵，我不能夥一天沒有　！你看，她是多麽美麗温柔，態度又是多麽大方，我們的女朋友當中　誰能够比得上如呵…］　　　這時　將他扶到荷于　　，給他一杯開水喝重我說</p>
<p>［開　　　　　　　　　對　　一樣　不是　笑話嗎？］</p>

<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（十四）［奮鬥］導演史東山（下）</p>
<p>［在目前的狀態之下，或是對於政治方面，你有什麽意見沒有？］我說。　　［我覺得無論在何種政治環境之下，對於政治上的錯誤，對於社會的不良，我們在國民立塲上總應當批判和指斥。固然電影應當和政治發生關係，但是要强制電影成爲政治的代言人，到底是極愚笨的方法。因爲這始終是不可能的事。除非電影藝人自身，對於某種政治感覺深切滿意的時候。］</p>
<p>［那末你以爲目前中國需要何種電影？］又是我間。　　［當然，現社會不會使我滿意，所以我以爲極需要暴露社會矛盾的影片。自然這得以事實證明，我個人是反對僅僅是暴露而無指示的影片的。我們應當使觀衆看了電影之後而成爲推動社會的動力。很顯然的，社會有毛病，民衆自身也有毛病。譬如說我們責備不抵抗，但自身更應當拿出抵抗的力量。有許多人常愛獨自坐着說風凉話，這是極不對的態度。……］</p>
<p>在這裏還說了許多，不必一一記載。其次我又說；</p>
<p>［現在我所要知道的是先生對於世界電影的意見了。］</p>
<p>［哼，這個題目很大。不過簡單的說，我以爲最近的俄國電影，的確很有宣傳的力量，他們的電影不僅是一種好玩的東西。英國的電影，近年來大有進步。美國電影，有少數作家在意識上極力掙扎着，力求上進。德國的影片，近來很少，沒有什麽新的意見。總之，各國的電影，都極力提高它自身之地位，而中國電影却不認淸其偉大的力量，眞是可惜。</p>
<p>［再說一句，電影必須以社會的變遷爲轉移，電影必須成爲觀衆所需要的東西。］</p>
<p>說到這裏，我便詢問他今後製片之程序了。他的回答是社會的，民族的相互並重，因爲二者都是目前所急迫需要的東西。譬如這一部［女人］是社會問題的，而下一部將爲民族問題的。其後我又問；</p>
<p>［你入電影以來，已經拍過幾部片子了？］</p>
<p>［這等想一想。］他說：［……哼，一共是十二部了。］</p>
<p>［其中重要的，自己認爲滿意的，可不可以列舉出來？］</p>
<p>［這個麽丨］他用着京戲中道白的調子。</p>
<p>［同性之愛］丨丨民國十四年（二十四歲）</p>
<p>［兒孫福］丨丨丨十五年</p>
<p>［王氏四俠］丨丨十五年</p>
<p>［奇女子］丨丨丨十七年</p>
<p>［姮娘］丨丨丨丨十九年</p>
<p>［奮鬥］丨丨丨丨二十一年（三十一歲）</p>
<p>最後我又問及他入電影界的經過。他的回答是；</p>
<p>［我原是一個學畫的人，好時在春光美術會。後來我因爲和但杜宇是朋友的原故，便在上海影片公司當演員了，其實不過是票友的性質。這是二十歲那一年的事。因爲能够畫畫的原故，間或畫了幾張字幕的佈景，這樣，漸漸的涉及佈景等等。直至二十三歲時，開始導演一部［楊花恨］，那是當時所謂騷姊姊韓雲珍主演的。…以後可以從略了。］</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c258">評［展覽會］ <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨明星出品·新光開映丨</p>
<p>展覽會大半是以［林家舖子］改編的，這是很明顯的事實。當然我們並不要求劇作者完全忠實於小說，因爲文學和電影，在創作過程中，有着極大的差異。但是這［展覽會］和原著之問，却是完全變了原質的東西，特别是在恊昌源（林家舖子）洋貨店倒閉之後，再加上一段原著所未有的［提倡國貨］，［展覽會］等等，却完全和整個的主旨相反了。我以爲這是最不聰明的方法。至於其他許多廢　了原作本意的地方，那當然是另一問題了。</p>
<p>農村破産，購買力减低，間接直接的敲詐剝削，商人之間的陰謀暗鬥，時事不靖，金融恐慌，商家的週轉不靈，小資本的商店，只有極凄慘的倒閉，這是最顯著而無可避免的事實。同時，在原著上也得明白的寫出：［不毁纔是作怪………老爺敲詐他，錢莊壓迫他，同業又中傷他，而又要吃倒賬，憑誰也受不了這樣重重的折磨罷？……］</p>
<p>這些，在電影上都以極晦澀的手法，相當的說了出來。但是，在後面劇作者突然加上一個莫明其妙的尾巴，其苦口婆戊的提倡國貨的精神，固在可嘉，可是在［展覽會］中却是極不通的矛盾了。他如恊昌源倒閉之後，那對門一家作惡多端的湧盛祥也跟着倒閉，說是受了恊昌源的影響，也是不能自圓其說的地方，這完全是怯弱的爲了迎合觀衆封建的旣成心理，而來一個天理昭彰的果報。當然，我們並不說湧盛祥還可獨存於這不景氣的年頭，但是爲了大快人心，又不能說出更好的理由。却不能不使人責難了。假使說，就在趙老闆逃走之後，他的生産被拍賣分攤；這一悲劇的收塲，不是更能加深商人們之刺激嗎？</p>
<p>導演的手法，我們不能忘記他在［香草美人］中相當的成功。但是在這一影片中，他却完全失敗了。</p>
<p>㈠我們不能很顯然的分出，那一家是湧盛祥，那一家是恊昌源，有時竟糊糊塗塗的以甲爲乙。這使我們想起華納出品的［生意經］，同樣是兩家對門的商店；眞是差得太遠了。</p>
<p>㈡劇中沒有感情，連一點幽鬱的空氣，都沒有很好的把握着。我以爲這是使觀衆最感覺掃興的地方。、</p>
<p>㈢佈景太簡單而且太假，雪以棉花白粉，紙片做成，這不是有意使人嘆氣麽？</p>
<p>㈣演員無戲可做，尤其是孫敏和王夢石他們，簡直只是一點細微的點綴。比較好的，當然還是謝雲卿，高逸安二人。王徵信次之，夏佩珍又次之，至於一位穿黑絨馬褂，以水烟袋爲裝飾品的飾錢莊老闆的，却眞敎人噴飯了。</p>
<p>㈤化裝太假，尤其是那位錢莊老闆。謝雲卿有幾塲也是同樣，我眞不懂爲什麽如此不愼重？</p>

<p>在過去一年中，珍妮蓋諾和却爾斯法雷的不合作問題，是震驚銀壇的一件大變動，甚至於法雷自動解除合同，脫離了福斯公司，對他們倆有相當好感的，都表示相當的惋惜。但據最近福斯公司正式的宣佈，蓋諾法雷再度搭擋，繼續合作兩部片，已經正式訂立合同了。在想望了好久的全世界影迷，誠然是較可喜的事實。就在法雷自己，也很想在再度合作中，掙扎出一個新形式，新自我來。所以，在合同訂立的事前，特别提出一條劇本有權取捨，要合乎他的調性，要有相當做戲的機會，他决不再是蓋諾的附屬品，他要全世界觀衆了解他是個富有個性的一員，並不是憑藉蓋諾的表演而倖致他聲名的。第一部片已在本月初開始工作，片名還沒有正式宣佈</p>

<p>— 思瀛</p>
<p>美國電影雜誌裏面，帶着滑稽口吻地說：希特勒的部下要和却利卓别靈勢不兩立了，其原因就是因爲這位笑匠的小鬍子，和德國堂堂總理，國家社會黨的領袖，希特勒氏的小鬍子，太不分上下高低了。又有人說却利自己不願保留那個小鬍子了，因爲恐怕被人家誤認爲希特勒。又有人說德國的國家社會黨已經向却利要求剃去他的小鬍子，因爲他那可笑的小鬍子，顯然他與他們的首領開玩笑了。但是我們要知道，却利的小鬍子，不是從今天帶起的。遠在希特勒的大名，被人家知道以前，這位笑匠早已用那小鬍子，大皮靴和手杖做他的商標了。依據商標法，希特勒還是冒牌哩！但是很顯然的一件事，就是却利卓别靈的片子，恐怕難以進德國的領土了。</p>

They moved from Jiaowei towards Tong'an, and there was news that the county seat was taken at 12:00 PM. This was mainly because the Central Army attacked Xianyou very urgently from the south, and the 19th Route Army was in a tight encirclement, so the matter was quickly resolved. Also, Yang Fengnian recently announced that Yang Sanhua, a separate detachment of the Anti-Rebel Army, captured Zhangzhou on the morning of the 21st and entered the city completely.

The telegram was led by Shen Guanghan, stating that Guanghan and others had decided to break away from the People's Government, support the Central Government, urge Li, Chen, Jiang, and Cai to leave first, and recommend Comrade Dai Ji to take over the maintenance.

<p>(Xiamen) The Central Army arrived in Xiamen to attack Zhangzhou. The 囗 brigade and 囗 brigade of the □ Division were transported from the provincial capital to Xiamen on six merchant ships, including the "Tai Shun," on the morning of the 20th. They docked behind Gulangyu and landed at Songyu Fugong at 11:00 AM, approximately 10,000 people. Two routes advanced towards Zhangzhou. Li himself supervised the troops. One route to Songyu arrived at Jiangdong Bridge in the evening, only thirty *li* from Zhangzhou. The 19th Route Army stationed in Zhangzhou had only one regiment, and upon hearing the news, they immediately retreated west of Zhangzhou. The Central Army could completely occupy Zhangzhou on the evening of the 21st. Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen left Zhangzhou by plane at 12:00 PM on the 20th, reportedly flying to Quanzhou. Cai Tingkai and Jiang Guangnai were in Quanzhou. Most of the 19th Route Army gathered in Xingquan. The Central Army crossed the Wulong River south on the 17th to pursue and arrived at Xianyou on the 19th, attacking the remnants of the 19th Route Army in Quanzhou. On the 21st, □ Division still had two regiments arriving in Xiamen and entering Zhangzhou to completely resolve the Fujian situation. The Guangdong troops had just arrived at the Fujian border. According to Shantou news on the 20th, Chen Jitang had ordered the cessation of entry into Fujian. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Military News: Two divisions of the Central Army can continue to arrive in Xiamen on the 21st. One division landed and entered Zhangzhou, and the other landed at the old town of Zhangpu, preparing to open up the Yunxiao Guangdong border area. The 4th and 5th detachments of Yang Fengnian's Anti-Rebel Army in southern Fujian captured Pinghe and Yongding on the 18th. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Military News: Over 3,000 Quan-Yong people's army, reorganized by Weng Zhaoyuan, defected in Yongchun Dehua. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The majority of the rebel army retreated south, passing through Yongtai. Our army is tracking and pursuing them. Also, our units advancing south from Shaxi are flanking and attacking Zhangzhou and Quanzhou from the east. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Song Yuanyuan, special envoy for Fujian pacification, said that after the rebel army retreated to southern Fujian, most gathered in Putian Hanjiang, while the rest were divided to guard Hui'an, Quanzhou, Tong'an, Zhangzhou, and other places, with a defense line of over 600 *li*, putting them in a most unfavorable position. The people's militia in southern Fujian are now being contacted by Yang Fengnian, Yu Chengyao, Gao Yi, Xu Ruilin, and others, and they have all launched a response to the Central Government. Among them, Yu Chengyao's Xingquan Anti-Rebel Army, reorganized from Weng Zhaoyuan's People's Self-Defense Army, totals over 10,000 men. Originally stationed in Yongtai, Dehua, Xianyou, Nan'an, Anxi, and other counties, they have made contact with the Central Army that arrived in Yongtai and Xianyou, cutting off the rebel army's transportation. Yang, Gao, Xu, and other units can also cut off their transportation in the Zhangnan area. Although the Nineteenth Route Army still has over 20,000 men retreating to southern Fujian, they are cut into several sections and can all be eliminated. The Guangdong troops have recently moved to the Fujian border, intending to reorganize the Nineteenth Route Army, but they are over 200 *li* away from the Fujian border, with Yang Fengnian's unit intercepting them in the Xiaoxi Shancheng area of Zhangpu. Even if the rebel army wants to flee to Guangdong, it will be difficult to pass through. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Fang Shengtao has returned to Nanjing after inspecting the northern Fujian area. His old illness has recurred, and he is currently receiving medical treatment. Fang said that the aftermath of the Fujian situation is complicated. The Central Government has appointed Chen Yi as chairman, and after the provincial government is organized, there will be relief measures. Although the rebel army has now retreated to the Zhangquan area of southern Fujian, the provincial defense forces in that area are strong. The provincial defense in northern Fujian has now been reorganized into the Northern Fujian Anti-Rebel Army, with two brigades. The southern Fujian provincial defense army has also been reorganized into the Southern Fujian Anti-Rebel Army, with a commander-in-chief and a deputy commander, commanding even more troops than in northern Fujian. Moreover, the provincial defense forces are familiar with the geography. The 19th Army cannot fight and the province will be completely cleared out of question. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan went to Fujian to command the navy and recover Fujian. He returned to Shanghai and transferred to Nanjing by the Ninghai warship. He said that after this departure, he first went to Sandu to consult with the commanders of various fleets on strategy, and then led the team to Fuzhou. Under our pressure, the rebel army resisted slightly and then collapsed. The provincial capital was then recovered. Because the Fujian provincial government has not yet been established, the commander of the First Fleet, Chen Jiliang, is stationed to maintain security. Once the new chairman Chen Yi arrives in Fujian and the provincial government is established, Commander Chen will lead the Marine Corps out of the provincial capital, and Chen will return to Shanghai to be stationed. The 19th Route Army has lost more than half of its strength this time, and is internally divided, and has no more combat capability. Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen are still obsessed and are still in Zhangzhou, intending to survive. Our frontline has passed Putian and Xianyou. According to my prediction, Zhangquan can be completely recovered in two or three days, and the campaign against Fujian can be completely concluded within a week. Reuters previously reported that the rebel army was reorganizing its remnants in Zhangzhou and other places, and wanted to attack Xiamen again, but that has now passed. The rebel side knows that the naval fleet and marine corps in Xiamen are very strictly deployed, and they dare not peep. Lin Guogeng, the commander of Xiamen's main port, is responsible for security and will also restore normalcy. This time, the entire navy fleet fought fiercely with the rebel army one after another, consuming a lot of ammunition. The details have not yet been calculated. The losses of naval agencies and buildings in various places in Fujian are about five to six hundred thousand, and repairs are underway. However, major repairs require too much money and are awaiting government appropriation. The details of the losses have been reported to the government for record. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Cui Guangxiu said that the southwestern proposals, in addition to being jointly signed by more than a dozen Central Committee members in Guangdong, were also jointly signed by Cheng Qian, Chen Jiayou, He Shizhen, Chen Zhongfu, Yang Shukan, and others after arriving in Shanghai. Zhang Zhiben, Sun Jingya, and others in Nanjing also jointly signed it. The committee members of Wang Jingwei and Sun Zhesheng will also be asked to co-sign the documents. Cui continued, "Although the content of the proposals is based on Hu Zhantang's eight demands, it is definitely not as exaggerated as reported by the outside world. These demands of Mr. Hu are also what the responsible persons of the Central Government have vigorously advocated in the past. Now that the southwestern committee members have re-submitted them, it is only to promote their implementation. Moreover, the opinions of the southwestern committee members are directed at the matter and not at the person. For example, in the political field, they only say how the political system should meet the needs, and there is no contention over positions." As for whether Mr. Hu will come to Nanjing to jointly shoulder the major responsibilities of the party and the country, he has not heard of it. Huang Xuchu, a central committee member from Guangxi province, left later than I did, and will arrive tomorrow morning, he said. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Pu Yi Plans to Go to Japan in Person to Express Gratitude</p>
<p>The United States is Extremely Pessimistic About the Far East</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When Pu Yi holds his enthronement ceremony in Changchun on March 1st, the Japanese side will, as usual, have representatives from the Manchurian institutions, including Ambassador Hishikari, attend. However, since this is the greatest event marking a new era for [Manchukuo], there is a proposal to dispatch a prominent figure as a special representative to participate at the same time as Ambassador Hishikari, to express the greatest congratulations on the implementation of the [Manchukuo] imperial system. The relevant authorities are currently negotiating, and it can be formally specified within the next few days. (21st Dentong Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The altar-like ceremony venue set up at Shuntian Daping for Pu Yi's grand [enthronement] ceremony on March 1st is scheduled to be completely completed by February 20th.

<p>(Changchun) This autumn in September, Pu Yi will visit the Japanese imperial family in Japan in the capacity of the head of state of [Manchukuo] to convey his gratitude for the imperial throne.

<p>(Washington) Important officials here are paying close attention to Pu Yi's recent proclamation of himself as emperor in [Manchukuo]. At a press conference with reporters from the New Voice today, they stated that the change of [Manchukuo] to an empire and the establishment of a new political system do not pose major problems for relations with Russia, but they are closely related to the interests of the United States. Although the US government still does not want to express any opinions, it is extremely pessimistic about the situation in the Far East, saying that it is like an arrow on a string, ready to be launched at any moment. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) What will be the attitude and policy of the Japanese army towards [Manchukuo] after the implementation of the imperial system? Naturally, it will be even more respectful to the [Emperor], and its guidance and assistance to [Manchukuo] will remain the same as before. (21st Dentong Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Impact of the British, American, and French Exchange Rate War <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>In order to save the American economy from panic, US President Roosevelt proposed a currency bill to the Senate and House of Representatives on the 15th of this month. The main points of the content are three. The first is to lower the pure gold content of American currency. The second is for the Ministry of Finance to take over approximately 40 billion *yuan* (par value) of gold stored in the Federal Reserve Banks. The third is to set up an exchange rate stabilization fund of approximately 20 billion *yuan*. The American authorities believe that if the bill can be implemented, it will definitely be enough to raise prices, lower exchange rates, and restore prosperity. Without this, it will be insufficient to achieve success. However, from our observation, the so-called goal of raising prices may not be realized. Even the manipulation of exchange rates may only intensify the opposition of international relations and promote the rapid progress of economic control. Therefore, at a time when the panic of war preparation is becoming increasingly urgent, Roosevelt's policy can be said to be a representation of the United States' economic arming and advance deployment. The repercussions caused by this are not to be ignored.</p>
<p>According to the Havas Washington telegram of the 18th, Roosevelt's currency plan has now passed the House Monetary Committee by a vote of fifteen to one. At the same time, the committee stated that "the government is using 20 billion *yuan* as a fund to stabilize exchange rates, and its purpose is to prevent the exchange rate of American currency from being threatened by the UK and France again. The United States should have the right to self-defense, etc." From this, it can be seen that the reason why the United States is rushing to manage the nation's gold is partly to cope with the power of the UK and France to manipulate exchange rates, but more importantly to protect the original market of the United States overseas. The economic panic of the US in the recent years has caused huge losses. It is certainly in the same boat as the UK and France. However, France from the beginning dug deep trenches and built high barriers, strictly constructing tax walls. The UK and Japan also successively lowered currency prices and strictly manipulated exchange rates. The result was a major blow to the overseas markets of the United States. Since Roosevelt took office, he reversed President Hoover's actions, first stopping the use of the gold standard, and then following up with a large-scale gold purchase policy. If that was not enough, he followed up with the current plan to concentrate gold and control exchange rates, believing that in such a shift, huge profits could be obtained. Setting up a stabilization fund of 20 billion *yuan* is equivalent to France's huge amount of gold and the UK's stabilization fund of 350 million pounds. The world's exchange market is also worthy of competing with various powers. However, the agility and combativeness of the UK and France cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>Looking at the serious repercussions that have been stirred up in London and Paris since Roosevelt's currency plan was proposed. The exchange rate of silver dollars in this city against the UK, US, and Japan has also consistently tended to fall. The fall in the currency prices of these countries shows that the fierce exchange rate war is already leaping up rapidly. Although there is still some debate within the US Congress, it is not legal for the government to take over the gold of the Reserve Banks, but there is no disagreement in principle regarding the reduction of the pure gold content of the US dollar, the confiscation of the depreciation benefits of the US dollar, and the establishment of a stabilization fund. The US is struggling from the shock of economic panic, and without this, it will be insufficient to make an effort. The UK, France, and other countries are doing this because it is the only way to cope with their markets. This is a necessary trend in the exchange rate war. However, as a weak country with rising foreign exchange rates, the rampant import of foreign goods is becoming more and more serious. In such an economic frenzy, how can we seek economic self-defense?</p>

<p>Sun Dianying Asks the Central Government to Send Personnel to Supervise the Departure</p>
<p>Zhu Shaoliang Telegram Urges Sun to Quickly Withdraw from Dengkou</p>
<p>The Military Commission Plans to Resolve the Sun-Ma Conflict</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui sent two telegrams to He Yingqin this morning. One telegram stated: "I have just received a report from Ma Binlin, the brigade commander stationed in Pingluo, at 8:00 PM on the 20th, stating that enemy troops surrounded Pingluo on the east, west, and north sides after 5:00 PM on the 19th, and launched a pincer attack that night. From 4:00 to 6:00 AM this morning, they bombarded heavily. Our officers and soldiers remained calm and alert and did not retaliate. I am determined to coexist with this city," etc. I ordered them to remain calm and hold firm, awaiting orders to attack. The other telegram stated: "I have just received a report from Ma Binlin, the brigade commander stationed in Pingluo, stating that at 5:00 PM today, Sun's infantry took a three-sided encirclement of Pingluo, and the enemy on the north side has begun a pincer attack," etc. Also, according to a report from Hao Jinyuan, the battalion commander stationed in Hongguangying, "At 7:00 PM today, Yang Houxiaozi's cavalry and Wang Suiqing's special service regiment are approaching the city, intending to attack Pingluo tonight to join forces with Yu Shiming's cavalry to attack Ligangbao," etc. It is clear that Sun's army is defying orders, resorting to arms, and attacking Ningxia, and there is no way to conceal it. Yet, they claim that my troops are blocking them and provoking them. This kind of trick of burying one's head in the sand cannot hide the truth from the world. For the sake of legitimate self-defense, I have ordered all units to prepare for war." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to He Yingqin at 2:00 PM on the 19th, stating that Yu Shiming gave the order to the army to attack Ligangbao from Woye at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month. The original text is very long. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed Wang Shiping, stating, "This time, the troops of my army stationed in the Sanshenggong area of Dengkou must pass through Shizuizi in Woye. Ma cannot understand and sent troops to intercept. He Yingqin telegraphed to stop, and I have ordered the troops advancing to Shizuizi to stop. As for the troops defending Wuyuan and Linhe, they are turning to Woye from the east bank of the river in Suiyuan. Ma again claimed that Woye is under the jurisdiction of Ningxia and sent troops to intercept, forbidding them to go to Woye. Woye originally belonged to the Ike Zhao League of Suiyuan. The map and geography cannot be arbitrarily fabricated. My army is stationed in Woye because there are few houses in Wulinhe. After negotiating with Yan Xishan, a part of the army is stationed in Woye to avoid freezing to death. The Ning Ma does not allow passage through Ningxia, and Suiyuan's territory does not allow marching. The wilderness is covered with ice and snow, and life is difficult. Isn't this deliberately putting the entire army in a dead end? Who started the trouble? Who is acting barbarously? Who is disregarding justice? I have telegraphed the central government, asking them to send high officials to supervise the departure and investigate the facts. I hope you can report this to He Yingqin and ask him to consider the suffering of tens of thousands of officers and soldiers who have survived the war and are now trapped in a dead end. Telegraphed the central government to quickly send high officials to investigate the truth. I support the central government and have no other intentions. I believe the central government can easily resolve this local matter with an order." (21st Dispatch) (Nanjing) Regarding the Sun-Ma conflict, since the telegram ordered the cessation of military actions and ordered Sun to stop advancing west, peace has been established on the front, and a part of Sun's army has arrived at Woye via Suiyuan and intends to advance towards Ma Hongbin's defense area on the east bank of the river. The General Staff of the Military Commission has drafted a plan for dealing with the situation, which will be decided after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing. The conflict is expected to be resolved. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Shaoliang telegraphed Nanjing on the 19th, stating that he had sent a telegram to Sun Dianying on the 14th, which read: "Commander Sun Dianying of Baotou, I have received your message. After your troops were ordered to stop advancing west, they suddenly launched an attack and occupied Dengkou, which is extremely alarming. You have also declared everywhere that your resorting to arms is only against a certain party and not against the central government. You are using the fallacious view of religious and ethnic interests as a conspiracy to provoke discord. You may think this is enough to deceive the public and facilitate your selfish plans, but you should know that the foreign enemy is pressing hard, and the people of the country are seeking unity to resist the enemy. How can such wild words be allowed to undermine this? Moreover, the Hui people are all part of the nation, have always obeyed the central government, supported the government, and love the country no less than others. How can they be discriminated against? Shao Yun has repeatedly yielded, unwilling to start a conflict in a time of national crisis and make fools of ourselves, giving others a laughingstock. But you have not realized this and continue to press on. Moreover, I have heard that some of your troops are of complex composition and make reactionary propaganda wherever they go. Your actions are not only a clear defiance of orders but also a great violation of public opinion. Therefore, I earnestly and sincerely advise you to consider the future of the country, not to ignore the inner warnings, and to quickly withdraw from Dengkou, leaving everything to be handled by the central government's clear orders. Otherwise, you will be the culprit of this conflict, or it may lead to even greater problems. Not only will the military and civilians of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia be forced to deal with you out of self-defense, but the people of the whole country will disapprove of your actions. If you fail to follow public opinion, success or failure is inevitable. What good can a mere show of force do? Sincerely yours, Zhu Shaoliang, cold." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin previously sent Hou Cheng with a personal letter to Jin to meet with Yan Xishan and negotiate the mediation of the Sun-Ma military conflict. After Hou arrived in Taiyuan, he met with Yan Xishan several times. Now that his mission in Jin is completed, he left Jin at noon today and will return to Beiping tomorrow noon to report.

<p>(Nanjing) Mongolian League and Banner representatives and representatives stationed in Beijing held a temporary talk meeting for fellow townsmen in Beijing on the afternoon of the 21st, with over a hundred people attending. They decided: 1. Submit to the Central Government that they cannot accept the autonomous method decided by the Central Political Council, and notify the compatriots across the country. 2. Regarding the aspects of the Central Political Council's decision on the autonomous method that do not conform to the Mongolian situation, submit them to the Central Government and notify the compatriots across the country. 3. Announce the circumstances under which Minister Huang accepted the eleven articles of the autonomous method in Bailingmiao and the review by the central authorities. 4. Send a letter to Minister Huang asking him to state whether he accepts the eleven articles of the Bailingmiao autonomous plan in order to clarify his responsibility. 5. Send a letter to President Dai, stating that he should take responsibility for the errors in the review of the autonomous plan as an important matter. 6. Request the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and Chairman Chiang to revoke the autonomous method decided by the Central Political Council this time, and promptly implement the original plan agreed upon in Bailingmiao. If there is still no result, the following methods will be adopted: 1. All representatives to Beijing will return to Mongolia and request punishment. 2. All representatives stationed in Beijing will resign from their original positions and return to Mongolia immediately. 3. All Mongolian personnel and students in Beijing will return to Mongolia. 4. Since the method allowed by Minister Huang is equivalent to zero, the original claim of Bailingmiao should be restored, and the local autonomous government should be organized by Mongolians themselves in order to unite and resist the enemy and avoid becoming a sequel to Eastern Mongolia. Yang Fen and others were appointed on the spot to assist the representatives in carrying out everything. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mongolian representative Sulu Yun stated that the representatives who came to Beijing have expressed their inability to accept the Mongolian autonomous method passed by the Political Council. In addition to requesting assistance after Chiang Kai-shek arrives in Beijing, they also plan to issue a denial letter and declaration within days, seeking fair criticism from the people of the country. In addition, Yu Youren, the president of the Supervisory Yuan, expressed sympathy for the demands of the Mongolian people and agreed to submit them to the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion in order to comfort the Mongolian people. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the Inner Mongolian representatives in Beijing have had many misunderstandings about the plan decided by the Central Government. The reporter visited Huang Shaoxiong to inquire about the truth. His statement is recorded as follows: "Many people outside believe that I was ordered to participate in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Conference and sign various conditions, but they do not know that the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Conference was an automatic conference of Mongolians, and there was no need for central personnel to participate. When I arrived in Bailingmiao, the conference had already closed. Only its presidium reported the progress of the conference and its demands to the Central Government. Regarding the Inner Mongolian request for autonomy, I can only answer the principles allowed by the Central Government. As for the detailed methods, the Central Government will naturally consider the circumstances of all parties and formulate, announce, and implement them. This is the highest decision-making power of the central government and cannot be determined by dispatched personnel or local personnel. Recently, Inner Mongolian representatives have had misunderstandings about the Central Government's final decision, and they do not seem to understand the above-mentioned reasons, and they are also unclear about the handling process. Because recently, Inner Mongolian representatives have also asked in writing whether I accept the eleven articles drafted by the Mongolian side in Bailingmiao. After receiving this letter, I felt very strange. Why did the representatives who came to Beijing this time and the previous representatives stationed in Beijing who had personally witnessed the process in Bailingmiao unanimously raise questions? It is very incomprehensible. The Inner Mongolian inspection report has been submitted to the Central Political Council. Because the text and materials still need to be supplemented and sorted out, it has not been published. In order to enable the representatives who have come to Beijing and people from all walks of life to understand the truth, the handling process will be selectively published first to dispel doubts. On November 10, I arrived at Bailing. On the 12th, Yun Wang, De Wang, and others sent more than 30 articles of the autonomous government organization law in the name of the presidium, requesting that they be submitted to the Central Government for record. I believed that it was too far from the Central Government's intention, and there was no need to discuss it. I did not agree to submit it and planned to return the original documents and return to Beijing to report. Later, after Yun Wang, De Wang, and others came to explain that it was a document sent to the Central Government and me for reference, I stayed to discuss it further. On the 13th, I talked with Yun Wang and De Wang about the autonomous issue. I believed that the Inner Mongolia's self-organization of the autonomous government had the risk of destroying the country's entire organization and affecting international relations, and the Central Government would never allow it. I instructed them to accept the Central Government's plan to set up local government affairs committees in separate provinces. At that time, Yun Wang did not express anything, while De Wang repeatedly stated the necessity and reasons for Inner Mongolia to organize an autonomous government. On the 14th, we talked again. De Wang still insisted on the entire autonomous government organization. I agreed that on top of the provincial organization, a joint meeting could be held once a year or two to facilitate communication. On the 15th, I made slight additions and deletions based on the plan set by the Central Government and attached practical issues. On the 16th, Yun Wang and De Wang sent representatives Bao Yueqing, Sulu Dai, and others to discuss and study together with representatives Li Songfeng, He Yangling, Kong Qingzong, and others. The representatives of Yun Wang and De Wang put forward eleven articles, the first of which still requested that Inner Mongolia set up a unified highest autonomous organ, and the other articles were also related to the first article. I immediately refused to discuss it. On the 17th, I ordered the entourage to prepare to return to Sui and ordered the entourage to return the documents. On that day, the representatives asked to stay for one more day, guaranteeing a satisfactory solution. At 12:00 PM, Yun Wang and De Wang sent Kang Ren and other representatives to submit their final written requests for two methods, A and B. On the 18th, Yun Wang and De Wang came to ask for instructions. I believed that Method A was still in line with the principles set by the Central Government and agreed to submit it to the Central Government for approval and implementation. Yun Wang and De Wang both expressed satisfaction and sent a Hao telegram (on the 19th) to express their gratitude. On the 19th, I set off to return to Sui. This is the outline of the handling process. In short, what I allowed to be submitted to the Central Government in Bailingmiao was Method A, which they put forward later, and not the eleven articles. However, the Inner Mongolian representatives in Beijing often claimed that they overthrew the eleven articles decided, but they did not mention the six items of Method A, which Yun Wang and De Wang finally requested in writing. It is very puzzling. As for the eleven principles set by the Central Government, they are roughly the same as the items in the final decision of Bailingmiao, and the various feasible issues in the eleven articles that were not decided in Bailingmiao were also selectively adopted." At this point, Huang showed the document finally submitted by Yun Wang, De Wang, et al. and the eleven articles of the Mongolian proposal that were not allowed to be submitted, as follows: Method A: ㈠ Name: Defined as the Mongolian First Autonomous Region Government, the Mongolian Second Autonomous Region Government, and so on. ㈡ Region: The Silingol League and the Chahar Ministry's banners are compiled into the Mongolian First Autonomous Region Government, the Ulanqab League and the Alxa Ejina banners are compiled into the Mongolian Second Autonomous Region Government, and other leagues and banners are compiled into districts according to the proportion. ㈢ Affiliation: The Mongolian Autonomous Region Governments are directly under the Executive Yuan. In the event of an event involving the province, the provincial government will consult on the method. ㈣ Powers: The Mongolian Autonomous Region Governments manage all government affairs of all leagues and banners within their respective regions. ㈤ Funding: The funding for the Mongolian Autonomous Region Governments is issued by the Central Government on a monthly basis. ㈥ Liaison: A joint meeting is set up between the Mongolian Autonomous Regions to discuss common matters between the autonomous regions. Method B: A unified highest autonomous organ of Mongolia is established, named the Mongolian Autonomous Committee, which is directly under the Executive Yuan and manages all government affairs of all leagues and banners. Its funding is allocated by the Central Government on a monthly basis. The original text of the eleven articles proposed by Mongolia but not allowed (omitted). (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Reconnoiter the Situation for Days</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army in Eastern Chahar attacked Zhao Jiaying outside Longmensuo again, after Huang sent Liu Shisun and Qin Dechun to negotiate with the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese military officer Shibayama received a telegram from Nishiyi, the commander of the 8th Division, stating that the Japanese army entered outside Longmensuo due to a misunderstanding in suppressing bandits and has now withdrawn to Heihe, hoping that the Chahar authorities will not increase troops to Eastern Chahar. After receiving the telegram, Shibayama forwarded it to He and Huang the day before. He had transferred the telegram to Qin. Qin replied to the Japanese side today that the Chahar Provincial Government has not increased a single soldier in Eastern Chahar, and the Chahar Eastern issue has come to an end and there is no need for further negotiations.

<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: After the 2nd and 4th districts of Guyuan were occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops, a large number of Korean people have now arrived. The villagers and villagers in the C district whose houses are slightly better have been occupied by them. Some villagers who are seeking refuge have retreated to Xinyuan County. The Japanese and puppet troops in Heihe often insert Japanese and puppet flags on the mountain peaks near the Great Wall line outside Longmensuo to create a false impression and spy on our defenses. The garrison troops in Zhao Jiaying, Hu Wenyu's regiment, are stationed in the trenches day and night on alert. (21st Dispatch) (Beiping) Most of the people in the Guyuan area have been forced to leave. The Japanese and puppet troops send cars out every day to reconnoiter the situation in Eastern Chahar.

<p>(Beiping) Shibayama received a telegram from Nishiyi, the commander of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army, stating that the Japanese army has withdrawn and hopes that the Chahar army stationed in Zhaojiatun and Longmensuo will withdraw to the west of the Great Wall line, and no troops shall be stationed outside the Great Wall line. After receiving the telegram, Shibayama visited He at Jurentang yesterday afternoon with Nishiyi's telegram to negotiate. After Shibayama left, He invited Qin Dechun to discuss. Qin said that Longmensuo is about 15 Chinese miles west of the Great Wall line, and we have never stationed troops outside the Great Wall line. The Japanese army's hope that Longmensuo will not station troops is an unreasonable request. He will inform the military officer Shibayama of this intention and telegraph Nishiyi. Qin also reported the general idea of Nishiyi's telegram and the reply to Song. Because Song is slightly better from his back pain in Tianjin, he plans to return to Beiping in three or four days to visit He and Huang and ask for instructions on how to deal with Eastern Chahar. After the matter is over, he will return to Chahar. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to return to Beiping from Tianjin tomorrow afternoon. After visiting Huang and He, he will not stay long and will return to Chahar immediately.

<p>The Dutch Territory Serves as a Petroleum Supply Base</p>
<p>To Prevent Wartime Occupation by Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from Chicago-based Japanese Consul Mutō to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chicago newspapers' special correspondent Sun Maosi reported, based on reliable sources, that the Netherlands, regarding its East Indies territory, has entered into a secret naval agreement with Britain. Moreover, the newspaper's editorial on the 18th explained this, intending to draw attention from various circles. The gist is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The dangerous target of the Dutch East Indies is obviously Japan. The reason is the petroleum issue. Because Japan has always relied on the Dutch East Indies for raw material supplies, especially the Japanese Navy. Its essential petroleum fuel is almost entirely obtained from the Bolonio region. Therefore, acquiring the Dutch East Indies is more necessary for Japan than any other issue and, at the same time, would inflict a major blow to Britain. Therefore, the major reason for the Netherlands wanting to place the East Indies under the protection of the British Navy in Singapore is this secret naval agreement. (Japanese United News, 21st)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Before the conclusion of the 78th session of the League of Nations Council, several extremely important events were considered and passed by the Council. The most significant of these was the decision on the methods for organizing the Saar region's self-determination vote next year. The matter was first presented by Mr. Arroxy, the League of Nations' special inspector for the Saar issue, who suggested that the Council should begin preparations for the issue immediately. Arroxy also advocated forming a small committee of three members. In addition to himself, he should be one of the members, and two other members of the Council should be appointed as members. Their task would be to study the Saar issue and report on how to conduct the vote. The report should be submitted at the Council's meeting in mid-May of this year. The Council expressed its agreement with Arroxy's suggestion and appointed Spanish representative Madaliaga and Argentinian representative Catillo to form a small committee with Arroxy and prepare a report. This report should include the following three items: 1) Studying the necessary methods to ensure that the people's self-determination vote is completed in a correct and lawful manner. 2) Considering what methods to use to protect the people's safety, so that they are not subject to any pressure or coercion from any party to interfere with the freedom of voting. 3) Deciding what steps should be taken to maintain law and order in the Saar region during the self-determination vote process. (National News, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Administrative Council unanimously passed a resolution on the Saar issue, stating that the League of Nations is determined to guarantee the freedom, secrecy, and accuracy of the plebiscite in the Saar region.

With the business of the Administrative Council completed, politicians are leaving here tonight. The British delegation is the first to depart for home. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations appointed special commissioners Mr. Arroxy, Mr. Medaliaga, and Mr. Gandhilo to specifically investigate the Saar region issue. 1) Investigate the election matters in the area. 2) Investigate the security of residents in the area. 3) Study the suggestions of the region's administrative committee regarding protecting the area and securing the people. Mr. Pengu said that this special committee is very important because there may be riots when the people of the Saar vote. (National News, 21st)</p>

<p>Pengu Explains Three Points Should Be Noted</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council of the League of Nations unanimously decided to appoint Italian representative Arroxy, Spanish representative Madagaliaga, and Argentine representative Gandilo to form a committee to submit a report on the methods of the Saar plebiscite. Arroxy proposed that the committee study various methods so that, when the Saar citizens vote, they can express their intentions freely and secretly in good conscience, without being subject to any threats, and that measures should be taken to maintain order during the voting period. This proposal was also passed by the entire body. French Foreign Minister Pengu explained that France is involved in the Saar issue, on the one hand, in the capacity of a party concerned, and on the other hand, as a member of the League of Nations. The reason why it is a party concerned is that the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that the Saar has the possibility of merging with France. However, the reason why France is concerned about the Saar issue is mostly because France is a member of the League of Nations. Because it has an obligation to guarantee the people's right to self-determination, not only France, but all members of the Administrative Council should find ways to ensure that the Saar vote is held in accordance with the law. There are three points that should be noted: 1) Protect the people of the Saar so that they can vote freely in good conscience. 2) Guarantee voters from mistreatment after the event, just as we have already granted guarantees to officials. 3) In addition, there is also the maintenance of order during the preparation of the vote, which should also be maintained. Since the League of Nations is the trustee of the Saar's sovereignty, the Administrative Council should find ways to arrange all of these things. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>The Narcotics Scourge in Puppet Manchuria Harms the Whole World</p>
<p>The Report Explains There Are Triple Dangers</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Gu Weijun delivered a speech at the League of Nations Administrative Council today, first describing the opium situation in China, and then saying that the establishment of an opium monopoly in Manchuria is sufficient to hinder the League of Nations' efforts to eliminate drugs. The Chinese government is particularly willing to provide the League of Nations with all relevant information that can be collected regarding the import of narcotics into Manchuria and Jehol. He greatly supports the opinion of the Opium Advisory Committee, namely that the countries producing and manufacturing the drugs should be asked to pay extremely strict attention to the applications for that region. Dr. Gu also said that the establishment of an opium state monopoly in Manchuria and Jehol is purely for profit and that the organized efforts to promote its production and consumption not only endanger the happiness of the Chinese people but may also harm all countries. The report of the Opium Advisory Committee stated that the committee had carefully considered the new phenomenon of Manchuria, also known as "Manchukuo," and believed that there are triple dangers in the area, namely: 1) In a place where opium production and consumption have already been excessive, the status of opium and other dangerous drugs has become more serious. 2) Persian soil has been imported into an area already full of drugs. 3) If the authorities do not plan appropriate measures to prevent the establishment of secret drug factories, the harm will not only affect China but also other countries. The report also mentioned that the smuggling of cocaine into India, which had decreased at some times, has recently increased greatly, and smugglers are using various new methods of transportation, even using private planes. The Administrative Council debated the report of the Opium Advisory Committee for a long time, and finally passed the report. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The opium issue has been resolved amicably today. When the League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting, Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun stated that he was pleased to announce that China had ratified the Opium Limitation Convention. Gu also stated that Manchuria and Jehol are still under foreign military occupation, and the situation of opium and narcotics in that area gives the Opium Advisory Committee legitimate reasons for anxiety.

<p>(Geneva) The Saar issue has been decided by the Administrative Council of the League of Nations. This matter has at least come to an end within the current session of the Administrative Council. The Administrative Council then continued to discuss the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay. The League of Nations sent a committee to South America to investigate the situation on the ground. The situation reported by the committee as of January 12th is that since the two countries have now resumed war, the investigation team cannot continue negotiations without receiving new instructions from the Administrative Council. The representative of Bolivia said that the League of Nations investigation team is commendable for fulfilling its mission with a bright attitude. The representative of Paraguay said that Bolivia's desire to extend the truce agreement is intended to take advantage of the opportunity to reorganize its troops in order to attack again. The Bolivian representative stood up to reply, and the Argentine representative also expressed his opinion. The report prepared by the three-member committee (composed of representatives from Ireland, Spain, and Mexico) responsible for the Great Chaco dispute was then passed.

<p>The Committee on Current Expenses Will Submit for Discussion</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations' Committee on Current Expenses discusses income and expenditure tomorrow, there will be a detailed discussion on the arrears owed by Germany and Japan. Germany and Japan are still required to pay membership fees and maintain the expenses of the League of Nations' new office within two years of withdrawing from the League of Nations. It is deeply believed here that both Germany and Japan will fulfill their obligations and pay the full amount. Recently, the League of Nations Secretariat received 600,000 Swiss francs from Germany, which is half of the pledged donation from 1932. It has been said that membership fees and other expenses will be paid soon. Japan's annual fee of 1,967,253 Swiss francs is now overdue, but Japanese representatives have stated that Japan will clear all debts, and the overdue annual fee will also be paid soon. The committee will also consider in detail the requests from small South American countries to reduce their annual fees. According to League of Nations experts, although Germany has not participated in League of Nations meetings, it has paid its annual fees, while the South American countries have participated in various affairs but have never paid. If Germany and Japan clear their debts this time, then they will necessarily demand that the South American countries repay their historical arrears. If their arrears are tolerated, then Britain will also stop paying in September of this year. Britain pays 3,466,499 Swiss francs to the League of Nations each year, accounting for most of the League of Nations' total current income, so it has a great influence on the League of Nations.

<p>Germany's Reply to France</p>
<h3 id="e59">Leaves Room for Continued Negotiations <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) According to what is revealed in the morning newspaper here, Germany's reply to the French memorandum still leaves room for continued negotiations. However, at the same time, it stated that, in principle, Germany cannot agree to the division of arms reduction into two stages, with the first stage being a trial period. Furthermore, Germany does not attach importance to the possibility of France reducing its military aircraft by 50%, because Germany itself has no air force. The morning newspaper further stated that the German reply requested the French government to clarify the points that were not clearly stated in its memorandum. This is a delaying tactic by the German government to resolve the disarmament issue. The Little Parisian newspaper stated that the content of the German reply is extremely complex and very difficult to analyze. The document not only contains requests for further explanations but also contains extremely strict observations and counter-proposals. Therefore, it is impossible to judge whether continued negotiations are possible without carefully reviewing it. (National News, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Extends the Meeting to Mid-February <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference decided today to extend the next meeting to February 13th, at which time it will decide the date for convening a plenary session. The reason for today's decision by the Steering Committee is that, at a time when various countries are conducting individual negotiations, they do not want to make too many changes to avoid hindering the future of disarmament. Therefore, Piness's proposal to immediately set a date for the next meeting was shelved. Furthermore, the meeting in mid-February will probably be convened in London. (National News, 20th)</p>

<p>◎Vienna: Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Su Wei Qu came here the other day and held talks with the Austrian government. Now the official business has been completed, and he has set off on his return to Rome at 10 p.m. Although the Austrian authorities are keeping the content of the talks a secret, the main points have gradually been revealed. Italy is determined to prevent National Socialism from advancing into Austria. This intention has been firmly stated by Su Wei Qu. In addition, Italy expresses sympathy for the pan-Germanic movement of the Austrian Patriotic League. It is well known that Su must have explained the parallel development of Italian and Austrian politics and its suitability when he spoke. As for the economic relations between the two countries, Italy has already decided to assist Austria in an effective way so that it can maintain its independence and restore its economy. Most of the talks focused on this matter. It seems that Su Wei Qu spoke earnestly on this matter. There is no doubt that Austria's diplomatic policy towards Germany is endorsed by Italy.

<p>Demonstrations in Front of the Russian Embassy in Japan</p>
<p>The Puppet State Changes its System, Dreaming of Recognition from Various Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that re-opening the war against Russia will frustrate the policy towards Manchuria. Before the management of Manchuria is successful, war must be avoided. Foreign Minister Hirota has met with the Russian ambassador several times, and his purpose is to seek a new path for breaking the deadlock in Japanese-Russian diplomacy. Foreign Minister Hirota agreed to release the Russian workers as a condition for re-opening the illegal negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway, intending to break the new situation. According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's policy towards Japan still emphasizes the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty first, but Japan still insists on starting with resolving outstanding issues. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy towards Russia is as follows: 1) First resolve the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, sweep away Russian political and economic forces from the entire territory of Manchuria. 2) Each of the Japanese, puppet, and Russian borders should designate 50 miles as a non-garrison area, using the non-militarized zone policy as a means to avoid war and maintain peace between the three countries. 3) Organize a border committee of Japan, Russia, and the puppet state to demarcate the border and handle local disputes between the three countries. 4) The Red Army must withdraw from the Russian territory in the Far East. 5) The Russian fisheries rights, oil issues, and forest issues must be resolved together. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy towards Russia is the opposite of Russia's policy towards Japan, and the military department does not fully believe in Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic policy. There are slight differences in the claims of both sides, and the future is still not optimistic. (Chinese United News, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota issued a formal statement of welcome at 5 p.m. yesterday on [Manchukuo]'s decision to implement a monarchical system. At the same time, he sent a telegram to the ambassadors abroad to explain the following intentions when they have the opportunity to dispel the misunderstandings of various countries, namely: 1) [Manchukuo]'s decision to implement restraint. The empire believes that this is sufficient to increase [Manchukuo]'s prestige as a new country in East Asia and consolidate the foundation of independence, and sincerely welcomes it. 2) I hope that all countries will frankly recognize this new fact that exists in East Asia in order to adjust international relations with Japan and [Manchukuo].

<p>The Seiyukai and Minseito Hold Party Conventions Separately</p>
<p>Both Speak of Upholding Parliamentary Politics</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Parliament reopens on the 23rd. Today, the Seiyukai convened a party convention. President Suzuki delivered a speech as follows: Withdrawing from the League of Nations, [Manchuria]'s independence, etc., Japan is facing extraordinary times both internally and externally. However, it is very dangerous to be confused by the calls for extraordinary times and follow foreign countries. We should base ourselves on traditional patriotism and economic strength and always implement national policies with an independent attitude. Politics, diplomacy, national defense, etc., are all organs of the entire country, and not exclusively owned by politicians and soldiers. Therefore, we should pay attention to this point and formulate national policies. Therefore, last year our party decided on the outline of national policies and submitted it to Prime Minister Saito. What kind of sincerity does the government have to implement it? You can fully examine it in parliament, but you should always be based on the country. Recently, there has often been discussion about political institutions, doubts about parliamentary politics, and welcoming the lawlessness of dictatorship, which is deeply regrettable. Japan's parliamentary politics can be seen clearly by looking at the Meiji Restoration's imperial decree. Its origin is in the past of the imperial ancestors, and today it is the duty of the people to complete constitutional politics. The theory of dissolving political parties is also misleading. Political parties have been organized for decades. Although there may be criticism during this period, we cannot but admonish each other to improve parliamentary politics. (Electrical News, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito held a party convention this afternoon. More than 3,500 people attended.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota explained the following policies regarding the diplomatic questions in this parliamentary session: 1) Regarding the relationship between diplomacy and national defense, he advocated unity. Diplomacy based on non-war and peace must also have a solid background of national defense strength. Also, regarding relations with Russia, it is rumored that there were differences of opinion with Land Minister Araki during the Five Ministers' Conference, which will be denied. 1) The Japan-US arbitration treaty for peaceful efforts towards the US has the possibility of realization in the future, and we should proceed cautiously at that time. Now we should be careful in our words and actions to promote national understanding. 1) Regarding the issue of the non-aggression treaty with Russia, it is not the time yet, which is the same as during Foreign Minister Uchida's era, and the attitude will not be changed. However, once the North Railway negotiations progress, the unpleasant atmosphere can gradually be swept away. 1) China must still maintain a quiet observation policy. [Manchukuo]'s monarchical system is a manifestation of the trend of East Asian policy, allowing European countries to understand that it is the cornerstone of the policy. 1) The Japan-India consultation is the foundation for improving Japan-India political and economic relations. In the future, based on the principle of mutual benefit and conciliation, we will adjust trade relations, and domestically, we should implement export control. (Electrical News, 21st)</p>

<p>Equalization Fund to Become a Permanent System</p>
<p>Financial Circles Express Willingness to Cooperate with the Government</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House of Representatives ratified President Roosevelt's previous actions regarding currency. By a vote of 360 to 40, it passed the currency bill to devalue the dollar and establish an equalization fund. All opposition was defeated. Various proposals from the authorities were quickly approved by the majority Democrats, while several amendments proposed by the Republicans were rejected. The currency bill is currently under review by the Senate Banking Committee and is expected to pass, possibly becoming law around January 23rd. Meanwhile, pro-silver factions in the Senate have drafted amendments aimed at raising the price of silver. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the Secretary of the Treasury has had his first talks with the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, and it is reported that the presidents have agreed to cooperate, the dollar devaluation plan is now facing severe criticism from the House of Representatives. Several amendments are currently pending, which may prolong the House debate. However, both Democratic and Republican leaders believe that President Roosevelt will secure a majority vote. Two of President Roosevelt's most trusted expert advisors will attend to answer various criticisms. It is expected that Professors Warren and Rogers will be able to overcome the opposition. The House of Representatives convened an hour earlier. Democratic leader Barnes warned the House not to leave their seats until the currency bill is passed. At the same time, Representative Somers, Chairman of the House Coinage Committee, stated today that President Roosevelt does not want the life of the equalization fund to be subject to time constraints. From this, it seems that the fund will become a permanent institution. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Current State of Anti-Japanese Resistance in Jiandao, Northeast China (Jilin Correspondence) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Account of Past Circumstances and its Organizational Content</p>
<p>Integration of Independent Movements by Korean and Chinese Peoples</p>
<p>What is Jiandao? Is it an island, a peninsula, or something nominally an island but not actually an island? Is it in the ocean or on land? Our country has a vast territory, and it is located outside the pass, so it may not be noticed by the general public. Even Japan, which regards Manchuria as its lifeline, experienced a major uprising of Jiandao residents five years ago. A member of the Japanese House of Peers said, "The uprising of the residents of a small island can be easily resolved by dispatching a warship." Thus, even some members of the Japanese House of Peers consider Jiandao to be an "island." In fact, Jiandao is not an island. It is located in the southeastern part of Jilin Province on land, and it is hilly land bordering Korea and facing Niigata, Japan, across the sea. It is a necessary route from Korea to Northeast China.</p>
<p>According to our country's maps, there is no place called Jiandao. The Tumen River from Maoshan downwards has many beaches along the river. The largest area of reclaimed land is in Guangji, which is about several li long and about one li wide, totaling more than 2,000 mu of land. Originally, it was silted up with mud and sand, and it was connected to the north bank of the Tumen River. Later, it separated from the bank, causing the river to diverge, forming what seemed to be an island. (Some say that in the seventh year of Guangxu, Koreans privately dug a ditch on the north bank of the Tumen River, causing the river to diverge, which may be true.) Koreans who cultivated here initially paid a rent of 8,000 taels of silver to us each year. In the 29th year of Guangxu, the Korean official began to call the area Jiandao and claimed it as Korean territory. This is the origin of the name Jiandao. In that year, Chen Zuoyan, the magistrate of Yanji Ting, negotiated twelve provisional agreements with the Korean officials to quell the unrest among the Korean people. The eighth article stated that the ancient Jiandao, which is the Guangji Valley reclaimed land, had always been permitted for Korean people from Zhongcheng to rent and cultivate, and this would continue to be handled as before. This establishes that Jiandao should belong to our country and is part of Jilin Province, which has become an ironclad case. Chinese influence also recovered somewhat at this point. After the end of the Russo-Japanese War and Korea was annexed by Japan, in the 31st year of Guangxu, Hasegawa Yoshimichi, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Korea, inspected North Korea and arrived at Huining. The Korean people submitted a petition requesting protection for the Jiandao settlers and also sent representatives to the Governor-General's Office to appeal. At that time, Japan also investigated the convenient topography of Jiandao, which could be developed. In the 33rd year of Guangxu, Japan sent troops to Jiandao to establish a branch office of the Governor-General's Office. This was the beginning of direct negotiations between Japan and our country. After our government heard about this, it dispatched Chen Zhaochang as the border affairs supervisor to handle defense and surveying matters. At the same time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs negotiated with the Japanese ambassador. They argued with each other for a long time without a resolution. At that time, Japan considered the area east of Guangjilue as East Jiandao and the area around Helongyu as West Jiandao, as an undetermined border between the two countries. The arguments they used were based on the reasons that the Koreans mistakenly regarded the land on the north bank of the Tumen River as their own, and there was no other definite evidence. In the end, our side held firm with accurate evidence. By the first year of Xuantong, the settlement of the Anfeng Railway Line negotiations was resolved through Japan's free action. Japanese Ambassador Ijuin took the opportunity to resolve all the pending issues between China and Japan, and the Jiandao issue was also resolved at this time.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Anfeng Railway Border Traffic Agreement in the third year of Xuantong, Jiandao has become a special area for Japan to transfer and colonize Korean people, and it has also become a residence for Japanese ronin. At the same time, it is also a haven for Korean anti-Japanese patriots.</p>
<p>The Koreans in Jiandao are nominally allowed to migrate freely, but in reality, they are all driven there by the Japanese. Once they arrive, they cultivate the land. Although it cannot be considered a paradise, they can still live there. However, looking back at their homeland being trampled on by Japanese imperialism, they cannot help but feel deeply moved. Since Jiandao has become a special area, before the September 18th Incident, the authority of the Northeast authorities could not reach it, and the residents of the area were extremely complex. There were illiterate Korean farmers, a small number of native Jilin residents, Japanese ronin, Korean revolutionary patriots, and bandits, good and bad mixed together. Therefore, Jiandao became a source of revolution and a den of bandits. The current Jiandao has transformed from an anti-Japanese independence movement into a "People's Revolutionary Government." The process is described in detail below.</p>
<p>The first phase: After the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Korea was nominally an independent country, but the Korean people were living in dire straits under the oppressive power of Japan, similar to the current situation in Northeast China. After Japan completely annexed Korea in 1910, Korean patriots never forgot their desire to restore their homeland. Therefore, they crossed the Tumen River and went to Jiandao in groups to live their lives as exiles and carry out their revolutionary movements. This was the starting point of the Korean people's revolution.</p>
<p>The second phase: In 1919, an independent movement suddenly broke out in Korea, and the Korean residents in Jiandao responded enthusiastically. There were more than ten independent movement organizations. In 1920, Japan sent troops to suppress them. Revolutionary patriots who had fled from Korea to Jiandao increased day by day. Therefore, they established various schools to provide education on the revolutionary movement and cultivate anti-Japanese thoughts, which took great pains. In 1921, the Korean Communist Party established a central headquarters in Seoul. These people, who had always advocated for the independent movement, transformed into communist propagandists. They also established the Dongyang Academy in Longjing, Jiandao, to promote anti-Japanese thoughts and communism.</p>
<p>The third phase: This was a transitional period from the independent movement to communist propaganda, leading to the establishment of the Soviet. Since 1921, communist ideology gradually became popular in Jiandao. Until 1927, it was exposed by the Japanese authorities. In addition, internal factional struggles were extremely fierce. As a result, the activities gradually subsided for three or four years.</p>
<p>The fourth phase: After a period of subsidence, the momentum gradually increased again. After the May 30th Jiandao Riot in 1930, it is said that a small number of communist party members from our country also joined. Therefore, the communist organization in Jiandao became more complete, and the momentum expanded day by day. The slogans were to overthrow imperialism, confiscate the property of the Jiandao Eastern Development Company, confiscate land, not pay taxes, and build the Jiandao Soviet government.</p>
<p>In the past, Japan adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards Jiandao. After the success of seizing Manchuria on September 18th, Japan mobilized its troops. However, after suppressing them once, the flames reignited soon after. Because most of the local people were farmers, they would return to normal and engage in farming when the [puppet] army arrived. When necessary, they would gather again and revolt. However, the Korean people's hearts are set on opposing Japan and seeking independence. Sometimes, they cannot arouse their enthusiastic sympathy for communist ideology. Therefore, the recent Jiandao Communist Party cadres have adapted to the psychology of the Korean people, stimulating the anti-Japanese sentiments of ordinary farmers, organizing peasant armies to overthrow Japanese imperialism, and uniting with the defeated righteous volunteers in Northeast China to fight against the Japanese [puppet] army. According to a survey by the Japanese authorities in 1932, four district Soviet governments have been established, implementing communist politics and leading the people in actively opposing Japanese [puppet] movements. The various organizations are described below: 1. Anti-Japanese Association: Organized by anti-Japanese Koreans and Northeast patriots. It includes landlords, capitalists, and farmers, who are united in resisting Japan, aiming to expel Japanese forces from the Northeast territory. 2. Anti-Japanese Workers' and Peasants' Guerrilla Force: Aiming to expel Japanese forces by force. 3. Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force: Mainly to defend against Japanese forces and protect the local area. 4. Farmers' Committee: Organized as a strategy for farmers' struggles, protecting the interests of poor farmers, uniting the peasant masses, and resisting Japanese [puppet] forces, local bullies, and usurers. 5. Anti-Japanese Soldiers' Representatives Conference: Composed of daredevil teams formed by righteous volunteers, specializing in anti-Japanese atrocities. 6. Young Pioneers: Divided into organizational, propaganda, and training teams, directed by the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force, specializing in sentry duties. 7. People's Revolutionary Government: Originally the Anti-Japanese People's Government, later renamed the People's Revolutionary Government. It designates districts, establishes national borders, implements Soviet politics, and is the central hub of all mass organizations.</p>

<h3 id="e82">War Situation of Japanese Army Invading Longmen <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations by Our Side Lead to Japanese Army's Retreat</p>
<p>Japanese Army Still Instigating Li Shouxin's Troops to Invade Westward</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping reports that since the transfer of Tang Yulin's troops from Chahar East to Zhangjiakou for training and the rebellion of Liu Guitang's troops, various Chahar provincial armies have been transferred to garrison the area. The Japanese army had an existing plan to invade Chahar Province, employing a gradual encroachment policy to seize our territory. Taking advantage of our troop transfers, they launched a sudden invasion, attempting to fulfill their grand ambitions. On the 15th of this month, Mori Ichiro, the Japanese commander of bandit suppression in Heihe, abruptly issued a preposterous notice to Zhang Renjie, our garrison commander in Chicheng. The notice was divided into four points: 1. The Great Wall line is the border between China and Manchukuo, and neither side may station troops there. Longmen in Chicheng belongs to the Great Wall line, and Chahar troops stationed there violate the agreement. 2. Troops stationed in the Chicheng-Longmen area should withdraw immediately. 3. If the troops are not withdrawn, the Japanese army will launch an attack. 4. Notices posted by the Japanese army on the Great Wall in the Longmen area have often been torn down by the Chinese side, which is an improper act. Hereafter, no Japanese notices may be torn down again, or the Japanese army will send troops to attack. A response was demanded by the 16th. This absurd notice was delivered to Zhang Renjie in Chicheng only on the morning of the 16th. While Zhang was seeking instructions, Japanese and puppet troops had already advanced towards Longmen, attacking Zhaojiaying, a position held by our troops. As for the enemy's strength, the Japanese army consisted of over 300 soldiers from a Heihe bandit suppression unit, and the puppet troops numbered over 400 from Zhang Haipeng's unit, carrying four machine guns and several small cannons. At dawn on the 16th, they advanced to the front of Zhaojiaying, a position held by our troops, and immediately fired upon the 5th Company of Hu Wenyu's regiment under Zhang Renjie's command. Our forward troops defended their positions, responding calmly while telegraphing the authorities for instructions. Contact was made between both sides in the afternoon and only stopped at night. Our side suffered slight damage, but the position remained unchanged.</p>
<p>After receiving a report of the battle at the front, Zhang Weifan, the chief of staff of the 29th Army in Zhangjiakou, urgently telegraphed Ping for instructions. Qin Decun then separately visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu to report everything. On the afternoon of the 16th, Huang Fu immediately sent a representative to negotiate with the Japanese military attache, Nemoto, at the Japanese embassy. Both sides agreed to first order a cessation of military action at the front and then send representatives to negotiate in Ping. Nemoto immediately telegraphed the 8th Division stationed in Chengde to convey this intention. Yesterday, the 8th Division responded, indicating agreement, stating that it was a misunderstanding, and had ordered the advancing Japanese troops to retreat immediately. Yesterday (the 17th), the Japanese army that invaded Longmen retreated towards Heihe. Our troops remain on high alert. Zhang Yunrong, the garrison commander of Zhangbei, also arrived in Chicheng from Dushikou yesterday to discuss defense of Chahar East with Zhang Renjie and Song Tielin. Song Zheyuan, the chairman of Chahar province who was visiting relatives in Tianjin, originally intended to come to Ping to discuss solutions to the Chahar East problem with the authorities, but due to an unhealed back ailment, he will not return to Ping for the time being. Everything will be handled by Qin Decun as his representative. This morning (the 18th), Qin received a telegram from Zhang Weifan reporting the situation at the front. The original telegram reads as follows: [To Director Qin Shaowen, Upon receiving a report from Deputy Division Commander Song Tielin: 1. Yesterday morning (16th), Japanese and puppet troops dispatched a small number of troops with four light machine guns to fire upon the 5th Company stationed at Zhaojiatun, carrying out harassment. Our 5th Company maintained calm and resisted steadfastly, and they retreated after about half an hour. 2. All our forward units remain in their original positions and have not moved. 3. I, the Division Commander, and Commander Zhang are both in Chicheng. Aside from already having submitted this report to the Chairman, I hereby notify you. Zhang Weifan, respectfully].</p>
<p>Although the Japanese army that invaded Longmen has retreated, they ordered Li Shouxin's puppet troops, who had already invaded the second and fourth districts of Guyuan, to advance westward towards the Guyuan-Binchang area. Upon receiving the Japanese army's order, the traitor Li inquired about the purpose of the advance, and the Japanese army replied that it was to inspect the situation and that they could go wherever they pleased. Li is currently hesitating. Our side now believes that the Japanese invasion of Chahar is still in progress, and is currently both negotiating with the Japanese side and maintaining strict vigilance to prevent unforeseen circumstances.

<h3 id="e83">Circumstances of the Navy's Participation in the Recapture of Fuzhou <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>First Intercepting the 19th Route Army at Shanhai</p>
<p>Then Two Regiments Entering the Provincial Capital in Two Routes</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou reports that after the successive losses of Gutian and Shuikou by the 19th Route Army, the troops at the front mutinied one after another, and the rear was bombed by airplanes. Soldiers scattered and fled, with no will to fight. Furthermore, the Central Army and Marines surrounded Fuzhou from Gutian, Yongtai, and Lianjiang in three routes. Knowing that it was difficult to maintain their position, they issued an order for a general retreat on the 12th. Upon hearing the news, personnel from various agencies panicked and fled on the 12th, leaving all equipment to be taken away by servants and nearby residents. Unexpectedly, on the 14th, the defeated soldiers of the 19th Route Army retreated to Shanhai, where they clashed with the navy. One company was disarmed. Cai Tingkai, in his capacity as the commander of the city defense, issued a proclamation, stating that they were still deploying defenses and preparing for battle in the suburbs of the provincial capital. Merchants, fearing the devastation of the area, urgently pleaded with Sa Zhenbing to mediate, willing to provide ten merchant ships in Shanhai to transport troops across the river, while also requesting the navy to allow them to pass and not intercept them. As a result, the remnants of the 19th Route Army went through the northwest and various villages, passed through Nanhai from Shanhai, and proceeded towards Fuqing. At around 7 PM on the 15th, the vanguard of the Central Army advanced to the vicinity of Hongshan outside the West Gate, engaging in a brief skirmish with the 19th Route Army, which had not yet retreated. The 19th Route Army retreated again towards Nanhai. By about 12 AM, the 19th Route Army in the suburbs of the provincial capital had completely retreated. The two regiments of the 2nd Marine Brigade, under Yin Jiaxun and Wei Feng, immediately entered the provincial capital on land and water routes to take over the defense of the city and the Nantai area. Chen Jiliang, the commander of the 1st Fleet of the Navy, also received an order from the Navy Department to lead the Chu Tai and Jiang Yuan warships from Mawei to station in Taijiang, showing up to pacify the people. Shops and businesses immediately changed to hang the Blue Sky White Sun flag and posted slogans welcoming Minister of the Navy Chen and Vice Minister Chen. In the afternoon, Jiang Dingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Hunan-Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, also arrived in the province with the 3rd Division under Li Yutang and the 9th Division under Li Yannian, stationing a part of them in the Pacification Commissioner's Office and Donghu, and the rest garrisoned outside the East, West, and North Gates. On the afternoon of the 17th, Jiang Dingwen and Chen Jiliang met at the Sanqiao Club. It is heard that Jiang intends to order the 3rd and 9th Divisions to continue pursuing the 19th Route Army in the direction of Yongtai and Fuqing. As for various Party and government agencies, they will wait for the central government to send personnel to take over. Chen Zhongjing, the special financial commissioner dispatched by the Ministry of Finance, arrived in the province on the 17th and will first take over various financial agencies and start levying taxes to avoid a standstill.

<h3 id="e84">Bandit Liu Flees West Along the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Lu Army Ordered to Return to Defend</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that after Liu Guitang's rebellion, he led over three thousand troops to flee to Southern Hebei, intending to return to his old nest in Southern Shandong. Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government and commander-in-chief of the 3rd Route Army, immediately dispatched troops to block him in Northern Shandong. Today, a long-distance telephone report from Linqing stated that on the night of the 16th, Liu Guitang's bandit troops fled near the Shahe Station on the Pinghan Railway. Due to the pursuit of the Hebei provincial cavalry brigade and Wang Qifeng's troops of the 3rd Division from behind, the bandits continued to flee west on the 17th. As of the report last night, Liu's bandits had fled west of the Pinghan Railway, heading towards Southern Henan, seemingly with no possibility of fleeing back to Shandong. From now on, the bandit suppression work will be the responsibility of Henan. Shandong has deployed anti-bandit troops in Western Shandong and Northern Shandong, including Li Yizhi's brigade of the 74th Division, Lin Binghai's 128th regiment of the 22nd Division, Zhao Renquan's militia regiment of the 2nd Route, Yun Qichang's brigade of the 81st Division, and Li Xuande's cavalry regiment. Zhao Renquan once led militia and Li Xuande's cavalry to pursue the bandits out of the province. Now that Liu's troops have fled west of the Pinghan Railway, they have been ordered by Chairman Han to stop the pursuit and return to their respective defense areas. Lin Binghai's regiment returned to Jinan, and Li Xuande's cavalry remained temporarily in Guantao and Qiuxian for vigilance. Zhao Renquan himself returned to Linqing yesterday, and his hybrid regiment also returned to defense today (the 18th). Zhan Shutang, the commander of the 81st Division, arrived in Fan County on the 16th with his directly subordinate battalions and companies, maintaining strict discipline, ensuring the peace of mind of merchants and residents. As Liu's bandits have fled far away, the alert in Fan County has been temporarily suspended to prevent their return. As for the actual strength of Liu's bandits, according to captured bandits, the bandits have over three thousand cavalry, over a thousand infantry, over two hundred camels, sixteen mortars and machine guns, and many rifles and box cannons. Along the way, they also confiscated guns from local militia and Lian Zhuang Hui, so they have plenty of guns. There are even bandits with two or several guns. (January 18th)</p>

<p>Yesterday (21st) around 10:00 AM, the Shanghai-Nanjing express train departing from Suzhou Station struck a man estimated to be about fifty years old as it left Wai Yangqi. He was dragged under the wheels to the Yang Bridge at No. 106.</p>

<p>The case of rebuilding the new prison in our county has been designed and planned by the previous two prison officials, Han and Kong, and the estimated cost is 40,000 yuan, which has been reported to the Ministry for approval. At that time, the Minister of Justice, Luo Wengan, happened to be inspecting Wuxi and also believed that it was necessary to rebuild the new prison. At the same time, Minister Luo, based on the inspection report of Wang Yuanzeng, Director of the Prison Department, proposed to rebuild the old prison in our county into a branch prison of the new prisons in Suzhou or Zhenjiang, with a capacity of 300 inmates. After Minister Luo received the report, he specially sent Director Wang to Wuxi to supervise the project. Mr. Wang arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday with technician Zhou Yuanfu. He first went to the prison for a detailed inspection, and then technician Zhou measured the open space behind the prison and sketched the drawings to prepare for the construction of the new prison, which took a long time. At the same time, the Wuxi Prison Improvement Association also held a meeting at the county government to discuss the prison construction funds, which were changed to 50,000 yuan. Half of the funds will be requested from the Ministry of Justice from the additional 50% surcharge, and the other half will be raised locally, so as to realize the project as soon as possible. According to Director Wang to the reporter, the drawings for this prison construction are drafted by the Ministry, and the project is the responsibility of the local government, and it will be realized in a short period of time.</p>

<p>The Jiang boat in Yangzhong County (i.e. Taipingzhou) set sail yesterday (20th) at 8:00 AM for Taixing, when it was suddenly overturned by wind and waves in Tiejinggang. The thirteen people in the boat, including the boat owner Guo Hongren and male and female passengers, all fell into the river. At that time, the British warship Innerde (transliteration) happened to pass by, and immediately stopped and lowered a sampan to rescue the people from the river. Only the son of Zhang Minggao drowned. Those rescued include Ma Changyin, Zhu Kuizhang, Huang Hengnan, Shi Guangzhu, Chen Bingwen, boat owner Guo Hongren, Luo Wangshi (pregnant), Wang Yongxiang, Dai Chenglin, and Zhu Qingcheng, as well as two children. Each person was given two dimes. The British warship passed through Jiangyin and stopped at 3:00 PM, and the adjutant Yuan Yongrui, sent by the Captain Arnerfu (transliteration), sent the people to the Charity Ferry Bureau. Yuan Junmei, the director, ordered each person to change out of their wet clothes, had them eat a hearty meal, and then arranged for them to be sent back to their hometown by the Dayuan River steamer.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Sharp Decline in Overseas Sales of Chinese Silk <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Total only two or three tenths of what it was before.</p>
<p>Silk factories are piled high with inventory and are shutting down one after another.</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, China's silk weaving industry has suffered a sharp decline in foreign trade due to the government's imposition of import duties on artificial silk and the impact of dumping by Japanese goods. Factories are shutting down one after another. Those that are struggling to maintain operations are only doing so by reducing working hours and lowering wages, just to maintain the current situation. The future is truly bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Important Reasons <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The silk fabrics produced by silk weaving factories are exported to foreign countries such as Southeast Asia and India, with an annual trade volume of about 18 million yuan. After the two increases in import duties on artificial silk in 1931 and 1932, the export of Chinese silk gradually decreased. Last year's exports totaled only two or three tenths of what they were before. In addition, Japanese goods are being dumped in Southeast Asia and India, making it difficult for Chinese silk to compete with Japanese goods in those areas. Chinese silk merchants' foreign trade is hesitant to move forward, regarding it as a daunting task. The recent months have seen the lowest level of Chinese silk exports ever. Moreover, Japanese artificial silk is not subject to tariffs, so its products can be dumped overseas. Artificial silk and silk are the most used materials for Chinese silk. Therefore, the use of silk has decreased accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e102">State of Decline <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of about 380 silk weaving factories in this city, with more than 4,800 looms, mostly in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. Now, due to the sharp decline in overseas sales of Chinese silk, inventory is piled up, production is excessive, and it is impossible to maintain operations. More than 20 factories have announced closures, such as Hongda Factory on Jumen Road, Taichangde on Tianbao Road, Minfeng Factory on Yangshupu Road, Meifeng Factory on Haizhou Road, and Yuanfeng Factory on Quren Road. Factories that have reduced wages include Hengfeng Factory on Pingliang Road, Wanbao Factory on Kangti Road, Baohua Factory on Yidingpan Road, as well as Yucun Factory and Jinxin Factory on Yangshupu Road, totaling more than 30 factories. As a result, labor disputes are rampant. The staff of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau have been busy with mediation recently.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Sales of Chinese Tung Oil in Danger <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The United States is experimenting with cultivation and increasing the amount of high-quality tung oil.</p>
<p>According to the Mainland Daily, the US Commercial Commissioner to China, Mr. Arnold, recently published an article on Chinese tung oil in a certain business newspaper. According to the article, tung oil has been a special product of China for hundreds of years. Because this product is a necessary ingredient in paint, 70% of China's tung oil exports are used by the US paint industry. If the supply can be uninterrupted, the US manufacturers will still import all of it from China. However, in 1921, the price of oil soared. In order to obtain a reliable supply, the US paint industry sought to produce this product domestically at a low price and high quality. The US Department of Agriculture had already experimented with planting tung trees in 1905, and now it is building on this foundation to seek development. Later, it gradually progressed, and its quality surpassed that of Chinese imports. This is because its refining method is superior to China's indigenous method. The tung oil produced in the United States is not only of good quality, but also its quantity is increasing day by day. This is because new uses have been discovered recently, so it is necessary to increase its production volume. The American planters should thank China for obtaining this profitable new industry. However, Chinese planters can also benefit from imitating the American refining method. The translator notes that everything in the world must be constantly improved in order to stand in an invincible position. China's silk and tea were originally major commodities for export, but their sales have been declining in recent years due to a lack of effort to improve manufacturing. Now, tung oil is repeating the same mistake. If urgent improvements are not made to compete with foreign goods, it is feared that in a few decades, China will also use imported tung oil for its own needs.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Crisis of National Tea is Deepening Day by Day <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Overseas sales of Chinese tea are decreasing year by year.</p>
<p>Sales in the Eastern Provinces have also become hopeless.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Times' local office, in recent years, China's tea exports have been almost entirely plundered by tea from India, Ceylon, Java, Japan, and Taiwan. Overseas sales of Chinese tea are on the verge of crisis. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai Times specifically inquired about the situation from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the International Trade Bureau, and tea merchants, and the following is a summary of the information obtained:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Overseas Sales on the Verge of Crisis <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In the past, tea was one of China's main exports. Recently, Chinese tea in overseas markets has been plundered by tea from Japan, India, and Ceylon. Chinese tea, which used to be the number one export in domestic trade, has now fallen to sixth place. The export volume has decreased by more than half when calculated over the past 60 years. The highest export volume of Chinese tea once reached more than 2 million dan per year, while tea exports in the last year (1933) were only slightly less than 700,000 dan, according to the Jianghai Customs report. The world's demand for tea has increased from 300 million pounds to 900 million pounds. This shows the decline in overseas sales of Chinese tea. The reason for this is that in recent decades, Japan, India, and Ceylon have had overproduction of tea and have implemented dumping policies. As a result, Chinese tea has been greatly affected. In addition, the global economic recession and China's internal unrest, poor agricultural harvests, and reduced production have further endangered overseas sales of national tea.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Chinese Tea Disappears in the Northeast <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The tea consumed annually in the four northeastern provinces used to be transported from Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang to various parts of the four provinces for distribution, amounting to 5 million catties per year, worth more than 4 million yuan. Since the September 18th Incident, the northeastern market has been completely seized by the Japanese puppets. In September of the year before last, the puppet state increased the import ad valorem tax on tea by 30%. As a result, Chinese tea, which used to monopolize the northeastern market, has fallen into a desperate situation. Japanese and Taiwanese tea took advantage of the decline of Chinese tea and monopolized sales in the Eastern Provinces. From May to the end of last year, about 2 million catties of Taiwanese tea were imported, worth 2 million yuan. As a result, the sales of Chinese tea in the three northeastern provinces have completely disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Tea Fields Lie Fallow, Tea Warehouses Close <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the decline in the tea market and the impact of financial tightening, inland tea warehouses have closed one after another. For example, in the two places of Wuyuan and Tunxi in Anhui, there were more than 300 tea warehouses that produced tea, but now only a few dozen can operate. In addition, of the 81 counties in Jiangxi Province, 50 counties produce tea. In recent years, due to the daily decline in overseas sales and the frequent ravages of the bandits, tea merchants have regarded operating in the tea industry as a daunting task, causing farmers who make a living by planting tea to abandon tea fields and seek other means of production because they have nowhere to sell the tea they produce. In most tea-producing areas across the country, tea gardens are left to lie fallow.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Industry Authorities Discuss Relief <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The crisis of national tea is deepening day by day. If it is not rescued quickly, not only will the overseas market be lost, but foreign tea will have a tendency to be imported. In a few years, national tea will be in danger of a fundamental collapse. It is learned that the Ministry of Industry has paid attention to this and has decided to revitalize the Chinese tea industry in order to remedy the situation. It has also issued orders to the agricultural administration authorities in various provinces to supervise farmers to work hard to plant tea, and to establish experimental farms in major tea areas to improve planting in the immediate vicinity, in order to improve the tea industry. It is also seeking to establish direct sales agencies abroad to avoid exploitation by foreign firms, in order to reduce costs and compete with Japanese tea and other teas to restore the glory of Chinese tea in the past.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily yesterday, the clandestine activities of red elements on North Sichuan Road in the city have become increasingly fierce recently. A few days ago, they even distributed unstable Japanese texts to the Japanese Navy. In addition, the Three L's Commemorative Week and the January 28th Anniversary are approaching, and it is rumored that unstable activities are underway. Three red Koreans who secretly came to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago are responsible for the guidance among the Koreans in Shanghai. They aim to achieve Korean independence and are in contact with the communist party. They plan to take advantage of the January 28th Anniversary to launch an attack on the Japanese Consulate General. Therefore, the police of the Consulate General have increased personnel and are on serious alert inside and outside the building in order to prevent any unexpected events. At the same time, they are working with the inspectors of the Public Works Department to defend the area near the Consulate General.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Second Special District Rent Reduction Movement Meeting <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Additional committee members appointed to expand the organization</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Shanghai Second Special District Rent Reduction Movement Committee held its fourth meeting at 434 Bubuh Road yesterday afternoon. More than ten committee members attended, including He Yuanming, Mao Yun, Wu Guowei, Zhang Gengshan, Wang Deyan, Huang Xianggu, Dong Kechang, Li Weiliang, Li Jiatai, Wang Shunfa, Gong Jingyan, and Zhang Zongyao. Huang Xianggu was elected as chairman. After the rituals, the chairman reported that since the January 28th War, the market in Shanghai has been sluggish, and the commercial depression has meant that many businesses have been unable to maintain operations and have declared bankruptcy. In view of this, the United Association of Citizens of the Second Special District initiated the organization of this committee in September of last year to achieve the goal of rent reduction in order to reduce the burden on citizens. However, due to the small number of staff, progress has been slow. Now that the rent reduction issue is the unanimous demand of the citizens, this committee should work hard to carry out the movement, but in order to gather opinions and benefit from each other's wisdom, the organization should also be expanded in order to achieve results. Then, the discussion began: (1) In view of the needs of the environment, the organization should be expanded. It was resolved that the Citizens' Federation should be reported to the committee for the appointment of Cheng Zhusun, Sheng Zhiren, Zhou Chunxiu, Cai Ruizhai, Feng Song, Wu Xiu, Shen Weixin, Huang E, Wang Longzhang, Zhu Xiaochun, Wang Shuji, and Gu Wensheng as members of this committee. (2) Announce in the newspaper that if any tenants in this district's neighborhoods and villages are being oppressed by landlords, they can report to this committee for handling. The resolution was passed. (3) It was decided to hold an expanded committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 27th of this month. The resolution was passed. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<p>Labor Union to Negotiate with Company Tomorrow</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She said that the Shanghai-Ningbo route of the Sanbei Company's Small Sanbei steamer, the expulsion of the middle cabin workers' dispute, the middle cabin association, convened an emergency delegates meeting yesterday to discuss how to deal with the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exported Yesterday Morning   The Small Sanbei Steamer, the route was changed five times the day before yesterday, and the middle cabin workers were expelled by the company. The Seamen's Union, fearing a bloodshed, negotiated and temporarily ordered 16 workers to leave the ship, while the remaining 15 workers continued to serve on the ship. In addition, the company added six new workers who had not joined the union to work on the ship. The ship was exported yesterday morning. Due to the union's many obstacles, all the old workers were allowed to handle the matter, and no incidents occurred. However, everyone was extremely resentful.</p>
<p>Delegates Meeting   The Seamen's Middle Cabin Association, with the case of the British-produced Swire Company's Wusong ship not yet resolved, this company is now trying to follow suit, which is intentionally destroying the labor movement. Therefore, at 1:00 PM yesterday, an emergency delegates meeting of various ships was held at No. 26 Jiuxiaochang Road. More than 100 middle cabin delegates from various ships attended. Chaired by Wang Min, the meeting discussed and decided to submit a request to the Seamen's Party Department, the Seamen's Union, and the Seamen's Branch to negotiate according to law and seek a solution as soon as possible. The Seamen's Union will hold a meeting on February 1 to discuss the entire reorganization of the middle cabin.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Returns to Shanghai   In order to avoid the expansion of the situation, the Seamen's Union has temporarily decided on a transitional method of half the work, and will discuss a solution after the company's manager, Yu Qiaqing, returns to Shanghai. It is now known that Mr. Yu has returned to Shanghai from Beijing today. The union has decided to negotiate with the company tomorrow to establish a permanent method. However, the workers stated that if the union cannot resolve the matter, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices when the ship arrives in Shanghai on the 30th to deal with the company.

<h3 id="e129">Declared Hunger Strike Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Demanding the Return of Workers' Savings</p>
<p>To Petition the Party and Government This Morning</p>
<p>Da Gong She reported that the Samsung Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road in East Shanghai was founded by Sheng Xingxun, Minister of Posts and Communications of the late Qing Dynasty, and has been in operation for more than 50 years, with a wide scope and employing more than 4,000 workers. These workers have an organization called the Tongshan Association, and each worker donates two days' wages each year. Over the years, the amount has reached more than 500,000 yuan, and the funds are handled by the factory manager, Sheng Yujun, stored in the bank, and a lot of real estate has been purchased in the Yangshupu area. In 1930, the factory was sold to the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, but the workers' savings have not yet been returned. A lawsuit was filed in court, and the court ordered Sheng Yujun to pay 120,000 to ensure his release. However, the lawsuit has not yet been judged, causing panic among the workers. After discussion, it was decided to seek a final solution to seek social justice.</p>

<p>The workers elected representatives to repeatedly demand that Sheng Yujun return the savings, but there was still no result. The workers believed that such a delay meant that the workers' representatives had other intentions, and severely criticized them. In order to prove their innocence, the representatives carried bedding to Sheng Yujun's residence at No. 122, Western Alley, Xinxingli, Tiantong Road at 7:00 AM yesterday and declared a hunger strike to seek a final solution. The workers on hunger strike include Gu Lansheng, Zeng Songshan, Lu Zhida, Ding Zhuting, Lu Wenbin, Sheng Zhongheng, Liu Binghai, and seven others.</p>

<p>To Petition the Party and Government Separately This Morning</p>
<p>The outer silverware workers in the gold shop industry in this city have been in a labor dispute due to their opposition to the bosses deducting wages. Fourteen companies have gone on strike, and the situation is quite serious. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e137">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Public Works Department to Strive for the Longan Industry Not to Be Subject to Miscellaneous License Fees <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Forty-Six Industries Jointly Assist</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, for the new miscellaneous taxes created by the Health Department of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, forcing the Longan industry to obtain food donation licenses, specially wrote to the Engineering Bureau to strive for exemption from paying the license. The original text is recorded as follows: Dear Sirs, On the 19th of this month, according to the Shanghai Dried Fragrant Longan Industry Association, as well as the postal transport industry, the coal industry, and other forty-six industry associations, they jointly stated in a letter that, according to a joint letter from 13 members including Rongchun, etc., our stores are opened on Fujian Road, and the oldest brand has been around for more than 50 years, and the next oldest is more than 10 years. (There are account books and house tax receipts as proof) There has never been a precedent for needing to donate licenses with cooked food stores. However, in November 1927 and July 1932, the Health Department of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau wanted to collect food donations from our stores, and they were all exempted after requesting the Chinese Taxpayers Association to argue on the basis of reason and the court to uphold justice. There are old cases to be checked. According to the first special district court of July 25, 1932, when Judge Shen of the Liao Police Court heard the case, he said that the Engineering Bureau's lawsuit against Rongchun Yongchun and other stores for violating regulations did not apply to Article 34 of the Yangjingbang. If they want to order the store to obtain a license, they must revise the Yangjingbang regulations before there is a basis. Judge Shen upheld justice and protected the rights of Chinese businessmen, and his merits are truly praiseworthy. The Engineering Bureau has repeatedly sued for seven years, hearing no less than dozens of courts. Our stores have repeatedly protested, denying the donation, embracing the spirit of unyielding struggle, fearing that it would affect the rights of the entire Chinese merchants in the country and the concession. Last year, the Health Department of the Engineering Bureau again sued our stores in the first local court of the special zone for opening food stores on Fujian Road on April 10, June 23, July 28, and November 30 without donating licenses to the Health Department, claiming that it violated regulations, which is inconsistent with the facts, because the items sold by our stores are mostly sandalwood and longan and other raw dried fruits, and other items such as walnuts and lychees do not interfere with hygiene. According to Article 34 of the Yangjingbang regulations, teahouses, restaurants, dance halls, storytelling venues, etc. must donate licenses, that is, the Chinese food sale shop license of the Engineering Bureau, which explains that this license is applicable to all shops selling fresh meat, fresh fish, poultry, vegetables, and cooked food. Judging from this, it can be clearly understood that our stores are not cooked food stores at all, nor are they food stores. The so-called cooked food store refers to customers eating in the store, not buying out. Then the goods sold by our stores are fundamentally different from food stores and cooked food stores. The Health Department's lawsuit for violating regulations is obviously unfounded. It is difficult to acknowledge that such harsh donations disturb merchants and illegal oppression. When Judge Deng of the First Special District Court heard the case on December 15 last year, he did not examine the regulations of Article 34 of the Yangjingbang and ordered a fine of 10 yuan and a supplementary donation, which was to despise the merchants and arbitrarily impose fines and supplementary donations. It is difficult to be satisfied. In addition to filing an appeal, we specially request your association to approve the transfer of the letter to the Chamber of Commerce and negotiate with the Engineering Bureau to cancel it, etc. After checking the above-mentioned sections on the right, they are indeed true. It is unfortunate that the store has been oppressed by this newly created harsh donation, and it is even more difficult to be convinced by the unfounded penalties of the court. In this time of commercial depression, how can it be allowed to be arbitrarily demanded and slaughtered without end? If we do not unite and strive, our small and weak merchants will have no survivors. Approving the letter and the reasons for it, we urgently join all trade associations to write a letter requesting your association to approve the transfer of the letter to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau to negotiate on the basis of reason to cancel the harsh donations, and ask the Chinese directors to assist in the struggle to relieve the difficulties and pain of merchants. According to this, after checking this case in September of last year, according to the same situation as before, after transferring the letter to your bureau for review and cancellation, you replied that the engineering bureau has the right to order this food shop to obtain a license according to the concession regulations, etc. However, after careful examination of Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Concession Regulations, the shops and venues that should be licensed are listed, and the shops not listed do not need to be licensed. It is certainly not possible to use the word "right" to force a license indefinitely. The items sold in sandalwood longan shops are mostly made through exquisite procedures, and there has never been a hygiene problem. It can be seen that they cannot be licensed. It is inevitable to have an abuse of power to charge a fee for native product stores that should not be licensed. The corresponding letter will continue to be sent according to the situation, and we hope that your bureau will check that the sandalwood longan store is not listed in Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Concession Regulations, and will not be forced to pay a license. It is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>On January 7 of this year, the Chinese Jisheng Association, according to the report of President Lu Zhang of the Chang'an Branch, said that Wugong Fufeng Qishan County and Zhouwu in the western part of Shaanxi Province have been hit by major disasters for many years. The fields have long been bankrupt. At the end of the year and the beginning of spring, there is no clothing and no food, and there is no way to help. Those who fled to the province came in droves. The branch plans to set up a porridge factory in the provincial capital, fearing that the disaster victims will hear the news and gather together, and the porridge will be too thin to cope with. They cannot give dry food in the province at their discretion. The number is temporarily set at 2,000 people, starting from the first day of the twelfth lunar month of the old calendar for a period of three months. The current price of grain in Xi'an is about one yuan per斗 for millet. It is estimated that 2,000 people will be given six taels of grain per person per day, calculated for three months, a total of more than 270 shi of grain is needed, about 3,000 yuan. The branch ran around calling for help, but there was no way to do it. They sent a letter begging for help and maintaining life, etc. When the association discussed with its colleagues again and again, they found that the funds were exhausted and it was difficult to raise funds. It was agreed that the association would first approve 1,000 yuan and reply by telegram to start immediately to comfort the victims. In this snow and ice day, the whole country is full of mourning, and how can a scoop of water save them? Those with a heart have to cry and appeal to our compassionate comrades.</p>

<p>Xu Denies Ever Writing This Book</p>
<p>Accuses Jin Wentang Owner of Fraud</p>
<p>Xu Zhenya, owner of Qinghua Bookstore on Jiaotong Road, is a prolific writer. However, his works are published by his own bookstore. Recently, the Jin Wentang Bookstore published a novel called [Counter-Romance of Laughter and Tears], which listed Xu as the author. After seeing it, Xu believed that he did not want to take credit for others' work, so he hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to sue Li Dingchen, owner of Jin Wentang Bookstore, for harming his reputation and defrauding money in the First Special District Court, stating that the defendant had arbitrarily added his name to the list of authors of the book and published advertisements in various newspapers to promote it as much as possible. The plaintiff is a literary man who has always respected morality and valued his reputation. He has never met the defendant, so how can he write and publish it? He does not know what kind of book the Counter-Romance of Laughter and Tears is. If the content is good, he dares not take credit for it. If the content is bad, he is even more unwilling to share the blame for others. Only name and instrument cannot be faked. The defendant never notified him before or after the incident. His behavior is tantamount to theft. He not only harmed the plaintiff's credit with fraud, but also used illegal means to defraud the money of book buyers. In order to achieve the purpose of defrauding money, he also published advertisements in various newspapers, saying that the old talent was desperately fighting for fame, and there were slogans guaranteeing how this book was with the plaintiff's reputation. The plaintiff's previous works were numerous, and their quality has its own evaluation, but there has been no writing in recent years, and the defendant actually used the Counter-Romance of Laughter and Tears, written by someone else, for the plaintiff to desperately fight for fame, and actually publicly insulted him. The defendant's behavior before and after constituted the crime of harming reputation and credit in Article 330 and Article 324 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff has always made a living by writing and publishing, but now he has been given a book of incongruous nature, Li Dai Zhang Guan, his reputation has been damaged, and his business has also been sharply reduced. The future losses are endless. For this reason, he filed a civil lawsuit incidentally, hoping that the defendant will be summoned to court as soon as possible and sentenced to the crime he deserves, and ordered to compensate for damages of 20,000 yuan. After being sued, Li Dingchen also hired a lawyer to file a statement to defend himself, and implicated the novelist Xu Zheshen, saying that the Counter-Romance of Laughter and Tears was originally introduced by Xu, and Xu was paid a fee. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit against Xu Zheshen for fraud. On Saturday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court opened a court to summon and question the three plaintiffs and defendants, but none of them came in person. Lawyer Yang briefly stated the case, and Li Dingchen's lawyer requested that the two cases be consolidated for trial, because they are the same fact, and combined trials are easier to understand and save time. The court agreed to the request and ordered both parties to come to court again at 3:00 PM next month for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Public Groups and Public Banquets in This City for Dr. Marek <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Public Lecture at Wuben Girls' High School in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Denmark is an Ideal Country for Us</p>
<p>My Country Should Learn From This to Revitalize the Countryside</p>
<p>Dr. Marek, an expert in adult education from Denmark and the Dean of the International People's College, visited China and gave a lecture at the Jiangsu Provincial College of Education in Wuxi. Yesterday, the Municipal Education Bureau and various groups in this city held a public banquet for Dr. Marek at the Bank Club at 12:00 noon. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, he gave a public lecture at Wuben Girls' High School. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Public Banquet <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The groups participating in the public banquet included Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Chen Bai, Zhou Feicheng, Hu Shuyi, Zhou Shang, Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Xu Zeyu, Ma Jiazhen, Kang Xuanyi of the University Education Association, Ma Gongyu of the Chinese Academy of Arts and Sciences, Huang Renzhi of the Vocational Education Association, Jiang Wenyu, Pan Yangyao, Yang Weiyu, He Qingru, Xu Xingchu of the International Society, Xu Zexiang of the Chinese Education Association, Chen Jicheng, Cao Yunxiang of the International Affairs Research Association, Chen Songchun of the Citizens' Education Center, Yang Minshi of the Shanghai Branch of the Film Association, Lu Shibai, Gu Xuchu of the Shenbao Amateur Tutoring School, Liao Maoru of Guanghua High School, and more than 50 others. Director Pan, the chairman, first gave a brief introduction, followed by Dr. Marek's speech.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Mr. Ma's Speech <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>He briefly stated, "I am very honored to be invited here today. Denmark's central position makes it highly suitable for international harmony. Currently, Denmark's folk high schools educate one-fourth of the entire population. Some believe that Danish folk high schools have a very strong sense of nationalism, but this is not necessarily a virtue of the folk high schools. Danish folk high schools were founded during the Romantic era when nationalism was prevalent, so the schools were naturally influenced by this. However, the unique characteristic of Danish folk high schools lies in their emphasis on teacher-student collaboration and the integration of language and emotion. The Danish philosopher Bishop Grundtvig once said, 'Language is the highest expression of personality and vitality.' Although he did not emphasize literature, the fact that almost all Danish farmers are now literate is due to the inspiration and guidance of language education. The purpose of the Danish folk high school curriculum is not to meet vocational needs, but to enable people to return to their original environment and engage in improvement. Folk education is not about testing students, but about answering their questions. Grundtvig also believed that children, while still innocent, should not be burdened with heavy educational materials. Therefore, during the ages of fourteen to eighteen, they should not be subjected to political education. Only after eighteen is it appropriate to implement national education, because at this time, young people become interested in various issues and should be guided to seek answers from history."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Danish Folk Education <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>"Its purpose is not only to improve the country, but also to promote international peace. The International People's College, which I run, was founded with this mission. When it was first established, it was very simple, but now it has gradually flourished, with about 120 students from various countries. However, people from different countries have different national characteristics and different attitudes towards education. We have made every effort to get them to cooperate, and now everyone can be educated under the same curriculum, and their feelings are also harmonious, like a small league of nations. Generally speaking, if international organizations lack sincere cooperation from various countries and harbor mutual animosity, they will never be successful. In fact, no country can boast that its own civilization includes all the advantages of mankind. Each country has its own strengths, so the first step is mutual understanding, and then the realization of a truly harmonious world can be expected."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Public Lecture <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>At 4:00 p.m., Mr. Ma gave a public lecture in the auditorium of Wuben Girls' Middle School, attended by more than 500 people. The chairman, Director Pan, gave an introduction, followed by the lecture, translated by Liao Maoru. The topic was ["Danish Folk High Schools and the Prosperity of Rural Society"]. Mr. Ma spoke fluent English with clear articulation and was truly a skilled speaker. The general idea was that the Danish national character is rational, and people are willing to work hard and not engage in empty talk. Farmers are literate and can apply scientific knowledge. The rural environment is particularly poetic and truly an ideal country for us. He then spoke about Denmark's land policy and cooperative undertakings.] Denmark has reached the point where tillers own their land, and the countryside is quite wealthy, so our country can use Denmark as a reference for revitalizing the countryside. After the lecture, lantern slides were shown to illustrate the situation in Danish folk high schools. Afterwards, the Shanghai branch of the Educational Film Association screened educational films, and the event ended at about 7:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Salted Fish Sales Stagnant, Fresh Fish Sales Booming</p>
<p>Mostly Japanese Goods in Marine Products Import</p>
<p>The fisheries situation in this city has always lacked precise statistics. Since the establishment of the Fisheries Guidance Center in this city, personnel have been dispatched to various fisheries markets every day to investigate the production and sales situation, and systematic records have begun to be kept. The production and sales situation of the fish market in this city for December of last year has been compiled and is excerpted below.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Reduced Imports <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, the total import volume of fish in this city in December of last year was 78,326 dan and 14 jin, a decrease of 19,391 dan and 68 jin compared with the previous month. The total value was 1,453,568.04 yuan, a decrease of 309,978.88 yuan compared with the previous month.</p>

<p>Order from the Ministry of Justice</p>
<p>To be followed by all courts in this city.</p>
<p>The First and Second Special District Courts, the Jiangsu High Court Branch, and the District Court in this city received an order from the Ministry of Justice yesterday, stating: "It has been found that many courts and prosecutor's offices in various provinces have established lawsuit writing offices, selected lawsuit writers to prepare lawsuits or legal documents on behalf of litigants, and formulated rules to be followed. This is extremely convenient for litigants who cannot write or are illiterate, and also prevents lawsuit brokers from monopolizing cases. The law is not flawed, but as it has been implemented for a long time, abuses have gradually emerged. Recently, it has been heard that these lawsuit writing offices either demand more than the fees that should be charged or try to force people to have them prepare lawsuits on their behalf in order to collect fees. If their demands are not met, they inevitably deliberately create difficulties, causing endless harm to the litigants, or delaying deadlines as a result. This situation, if serious, violates criminal law, and even if minor, clearly violates laws and regulations, harming both the rights of the people and the prestige of the court. It should be strictly investigated and prevented from becoming a source of abuse. Therefore, all courts should thoroughly investigate whether the courts or prosecutor's offices under their jurisdiction have lawsuit writing offices or similar organizations, and whether they have the above-mentioned situations. They should be rectified and not allow laws intended to benefit the people to turn into harms."</p>
<p>Local Yellow Wine Industry Association</p>
<h3 id="e154">Resolution on This Year's Rice Price Standard for Winemaking <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Local Yellow Wine Industry Association held a members' meeting the day before yesterday, chaired by Fang Zhongheng. The matters discussed are recorded below: (1) Discussion on what standard should be used for the price of each grade of rice for winemaking this year. Resolution: Regardless of contract brewing or self-brewing, the standard for each grade of rice is 14 shi and 7.5 dou. Each shi is calculated at 6.92 yuan, totaling 102.07 yuan. Each grade of wine is released for sale with a weight of 4,620 jin. This calculation is based on a discount of 848 from the former Haihu. (2) Discussion on the issue of tax registration for the industry. Resolution: The wine produced and stored by the industry should be registered in accordance with the regulations. However, if the brewed wine is sold to other ports, and inferior wine is found after it arrives at that port, the workshop, because the wine storage vessels were sealed in advance, may not know it themselves. Therefore, if there is an opening of an inferior wine can, the tax authorities should explain and guarantee that the brewer is not responsible. Furthermore, the registration should be based on a 90% standard (for example, 90 cans should be registered for 100 cans). After the registration form is filled out with the quantity and sealed, it should be sent to the association, which will compile it and report it to the tax authorities for record.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Court Judgment in the Ji Juemi Case <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the case of Ji Jueer being accused of seduction by Xu Yuying has been judged by the court. Ji Juemi and Yu Xiaomei were declared not guilty. The reasoning of the judgment is as follows: The main point of the prosecution is that on May 17 of this year (22nd year of the Republic), the defendants Ji Juemi and Yu Xiaomei seduced the plaintiff to Li's residence at No. 101 Cihou North Lane, Hadong Road, for fornication. On the 3rd day of the intercalary 5th month, they continued to fornicate at the Hongkou Hotel, with clothes, photos, and hospital records as evidence. The defendants are guilty of Article 240, Paragraph 2, and Article 244, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, etc. After the court hearing, the plaintiff's statements were mostly inconsistent with the indictment. (1) In court, she stated that Yu Xiaomei invited her to No. 101 Cihou North Lane, which is inconsistent with the indictment, which stated that Ji Juemi invited her. (2) In court, she stated that the fornication at that place occurred on May 12, which is inconsistent with the indictment, which stated May 17. (3) In court, she stated that she went to the Hongkou Hotel at 1:30 p.m. on the 3rd day of the intercalary 5th month, which is inconsistent with the indictment, which stated 6:00 p.m. (4) In court, she stated that Ji Juemi left the hotel more than two hours after the fornication at the hotel, and did not return until 9:00 a.m. the next morning, which is inconsistent with the indictment, which stated that she stayed at the hotel that night and continued to be fornicated. These are the facts claimed by the plaintiff herself, and the statements are obviously inconsistent, which is already cause for suspicion. The defendants all denied any seduction or continued fornication. Regarding the plaintiff's claim that she was given a set of clothes by Li Ziyu's wife after being fornicated at Li's residence at No. 101 Cihou North Lane, the court investigated and learned from Li Ziyu that Ji Juemi and Xu Yuying had never been to that place, and that he had not yet married a wife, so where would the woman's clothes come from? It is clear that the plaintiff's claim of fornication at Li's residence is untrue. As for the claim of continued fornication at the Hongkou Hotel and the gift of a photo from Ji Juemi, Ji Juemi strongly denied it, claiming that the photo was taken of him wearing mourning clothes with a memorial badge, which was originally published in the Hadong Rong'ailu and was widely available, making it easy to reprint. The court inspected the photos submitted by the plaintiff and found that they did not have Ji Juemi's signature or the photographer's studio. The clothing (mourning clothes with a memorial badge), clothing marks, and background patterns were no different from those published in the Rong'ailu. Although the plaintiff's agent, Gong Wenhuan, stated that the photos submitted by the plaintiff had two collars, which were different from the photos in the Rong'ailu, a close examination revealed that there was only a black line between the collars, not two collars. This black line could be easily added during reprinting and is not sufficient evidence that the defendant gave it. Moreover, the Shanghai Shangbao had already published this photo before the filing of this case, as can be seen from the court's case file No. 607 of the 22nd year of the Republic. The Shanghai Morning Post (December 23, 22nd year of the Republic) also published the same photo during the proceedings of this case, which further proves that the defendant's claim that this kind of photo was widely available and easy to reprint is credible. Although the waiter Xue Quanyuan stated that the person who opened room No. 8 at the Hongkou Hotel on June 25 (i.e., the 3rd day of the intercalary 5th month) was the defendant Ji Juemi, the hotel's register clearly stated that room No. 8 was for Li Zheng, 38 years old, from Guangdong, which is obviously inconsistent with the witness's testimony. Moreover, it has been half a year since June 25, the day of the court hearing. The witness is responsible for many as four rooms, and there is frequent traffic of guests. It is strange that the witness was able to remember every detail about the guest in room No. 8 on that day, such as their age, accent, when they opened the room, when the female guest came, when the guest left, when they returned, how much the room cost, and so on. Considering the circumstances of the reprinted photo, the defendant's accusation of falsehood is not without reason. As for the plaintiff's claim of going to the hospital for a diagnosis, since the alleged fornication is unfounded, there is no need to study it. Regarding the testimony of Zhang Danqing of Jishan Hospital, his diagnosis of the plaintiff was on May 14, which is inconsistent with the plaintiff's indictment, which stated that the fornication occurred on May 17. Zhou Hongzhang's diagnosis at the Red Cross Hospital on the 3rd day of the sixth month was that she had taken a small amount of ["Lysol"], and the reason for taking it was unknown. The testimonies of these two witnesses are not sufficient to corroborate the defendants' commission of fornication in this case. Based on the above, the plaintiff's case is clearly unprovable, and the defendants should be declared not guilty. Therefore, the plaintiff's age is irrelevant. Furthermore, Lin Ji, the director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, certified that the plaintiff was over 17 years old, so there is no doubt that the defendants did not constitute a crime. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment is made in accordance with Articles 357 and 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law as follows:</p>
<p>Various Circles in the City</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Xu Case Assistance Association Issues a Declaration <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Second Executive Committee Meeting is Scheduled for the 24th</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai All Circles Assistance Xu Yuying Case Committee has been working actively since its organization by representatives from all circles. Yesterday, it issued a special declaration, sent letters to various newspaper offices to uphold justice, and scheduled a second executive committee meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issuing a Declaration On January 16, various groups in Shanghai held a representatives' conference. A woman named Xu Yuying presented a case of being abused by Ji Juemi, and because she could not get justice through the law, she appealed to the conference. After careful discussion by the representatives of the various groups present, it was generally agreed that if there is still justice and fairness in the world, the case will ultimately not escape the final sanction of society. The various groups are a gathering of people from all walks of life, and it is their unshirkable responsibility to help the weak and uphold justice. Therefore, it was unanimously decided at the meeting to organize the Shanghai All Circles Assistance Xu Yuying Case Committee to seek a way out for the weak and to fight for the light of justice. Those who doubt that justice cannot exist today or that fairness cannot be achieved through money, we will see it in this movement. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Letter to Various Newspaper Offices Dear Editors, It has been found that the case of Ji Juemi abusing Xu Yuying has been tried by the court, and people are talking about it, causing much doubt. In order to maintain justice and help the weak in the judiciary, the organization of the "Shanghai All Circles Assistance Xu Yuying Case Committee" was established. It has been resolved by the first executive committee meeting of the committee to send a letter to your newspaper to uphold justice and to publish as much news as possible about the committee. Your newspaper is known for its fair and just opinions, and it is expected that you will sympathize with helping the weak and upholding justice. In the future, we hope that you will try to publish as much news as possible about our committee in order to promote justice. We sincerely hope for this. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Public Meeting After the establishment of the association, matters such as renting the association's address and collecting relevant information have been completed. In order to speed up the work, it has been decided to hold the second executive committee meeting on Wednesday, the 24th, at 2:00 p.m. to discuss all important cases. Notices have been sent separately.</p>

<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city sent a letter to its members yesterday regarding the change to the new system of weights and measures, stating: "Dear Members, We have recently received an order from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau stating that the National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry has inquired that Western medicines previously mostly used the British system, but recently many have adopted the standard system. However, the British system is still often mixed in. When using the standard system, Japanese and old translations are often used, such as calling centimeters grams or grams, cubic centimeters cc, and liters liter, which do not conform to the legally mandated names of the new system and are inappropriate. In the future, all Western medicine businesses must follow the unit names stipulated in Articles 4 and 6 of the Weights and Measures Law and Articles 52 and 53 of its implementation rules in order to comply with laws and regulations. In addition to separate inquiries, we also inquired about checking and forwarding the original articles of Articles 4 and 6 of the Weights and Measures Law and Articles 52 and 53 of its implementation rules, so that the association can forward them to all colleagues for compliance. We are attaching the original document printed and sealed and look forward to your pharmacy implementing it in accordance with these laws and regulations."</p>

<p>Zhenxing Wool Factory in this city, managed by Yang Yuan, invested 10,000 yuan to organize the Rural Side Business Assistance Association in Youxiang Town in order to revive the rural economy. Since its opening, it has been very effective. The association is located in the old silkworm farm in Nanxiang, covering an area of more than 30 mu, which is prepared for the establishment of planting and animal husbandry experiment fields in the future. There are currently only 30 looms, which have already been rented out. Only a few looms are kept in the association for teaching farmers to learn. Mr. Gu is very enthusiastic about this cause and plans to add dozens of looms to expand the scope and avoid regrets for the villagers.</p>

<p>Shi Jiucheng Donates 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Shi Hongdi, the great-grandson of Shi Jiucheng, the owner of the Nanjing Republic Bookstore, fell seriously ill last autumn. In a state of hopelessness, he vowed to heaven that if Hongdi recovered, he would donate money to help Northeast refugees. In less than ten days, he recovered miraculously. Therefore, in order to fulfill his vow, Shi specially prepared 200 yuan and entrusted the Shishi Xinbao of this city to hand it over to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association for distribution to the disaster victims in various places.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association specially invited accounting expert Pan Xulun to give a lecture on experiences in improving factory accounting at the Lianhua General Association. More than 40 people attended, including Ji Jiannan, Li Zhaohuan, Shen Jiucheng, Xu Yongzuo, Pan Yangyao, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Jiange, Cao Yunxiang, and Sheng Zhuosan. The lecture was recorded by personnel sent by Bingxun Stenography Agency. The main points were (1) Factories in our country do not have established standards for valuing inventory and depreciation, resulting in the loss of effectiveness of ordinary accounting. (2) It is still not possible to talk about adopting cost accounting in our country because of high costs and a lack of personnel. Therefore, it is best to use a permanent inventory system for bookkeeping and estimate the number of semi-finished products at the end of each month, which will almost cover the effectiveness of cost accounting. (3) For the accounting personnel in factories in our country, it is advisable to select young employees from the factory and send them to tutoring schools to learn, which is both economical and much better than hiring school graduates who are out of touch with the actual situation.</p>
<p>Investigation of a Case of Private Prostitute Falling to Her Death</p>
<h3 id="e162">Letter Requesting Punishment of Western Police Officer On-site <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Gan Zhigang's Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Police Officer Peier of the Old Gate Police Station, together with Chinese police officer Xu A Jin No. 642, went to the third floor of the Longfei Shoe Store on Zhejiang Road on the 5th of this month to investigate private prostitution, resulting in the tragic death of Wang Xiuzhen after falling from the building. Later, Gan Zhigang surrendered, stating that the deceased was his wife, and hired lawyer Wang Buyuan to file a criminal lawsuit against Xu A Jin with the First Special District Court, requesting punishment according to law. However, the police station determined that Wang Xiuzhen was actually a private prostitute. The case has been tried once by the Special Court, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, Gan Zhigang believes that since the Chinese police officer has already been prosecuted, he should wait for the court to make a judgment. However, at the same time, he feels that it is unfair that the Western police officer on-site is still not involved. Therefore, he hired lawyer Wang as a representative to send a letter to the Police Department of the Public Works Department, requesting that the Western police officer be dealt with fairly. The letter is as follows: "Dear Editors, I am writing to inform you that the party concerned, Gan Zhigang, and his mother-in-law, Wang Guo Shi, claim that his wife, Gan Wang Shi (i.e., Wang Xiuzhen), lived in the back room on the third floor of the Feilong Shoe Store at No. 431 Zhejiang Road. Gan Zhigang runs a rice store and leaves early and returns late. At around 5 p.m. on the 5th of this month, the Police Officer Peier of the Old Gate Police Station, together with Chinese police officer Xu A Jin No. 642, suddenly broke into the house, went upstairs, and knocked on the door. The civilian's wife, Xiuzhen, immediately opened the door. The police officer did not explain the reason and immediately slapped her in the face. The civilian's wife saw that they were very fierce, and her explanation was ineffective. The Chinese police officer, without asking questions, punched and kicked her. The Chinese police officer Xu A Jin was so violent. My mother-in-law tried to help, and the civilian's wife was grabbed and brutally beaten by the Western police officer. The civilian's wife was a young and weak woman who was innocently subjected to this brutality. In a very anxious situation, she shouted for help on the street from the window. The Chinese police officer Xu A Jin was extremely violent and ran forward to punch her, causing my wife to fall onto the cement platform on the second floor. At that time, her head was down and her feet were up, causing her brain to rupture and die on the spot. The situation of the civilian's wife's tragic death is indescribable. The Chinese police officer Xu A Jin knew that he had caused a disaster and, of course, his power was slightly reduced. However, the Western police officer was still on-site when the incident occurred, and did not stop it. After the disaster, he released my mother-in-law. Although there were private prostitutes such as Li Qiaozhen living in the front building, it had nothing to do with Zhigang. After the police officer entered the house, he did not ask the reason and immediately beat anyone he saw. Granted that prostitutes and private prostitutes have committed crimes, but according to the law, they are only guilty of violating police regulations. Arresting prostitutes is not comparable to arresting thieves. The two prostitutes Li Qiaozhen and Wang Jinfeng were both in the front building at the time and did not go out to solicit customers. The police officer should not have entered the house to search without authorization. According to our country's criminal procedure law, in addition to flagrant offenders or defendants who have been detained, people's homes may not be searched without reason. Although Li Qiaozhen and others were prostitutes, they were sitting at home and did not go out to solicit customers, so they were not flagrant offenders. The two police officers entered people's homes without authorization without detention or search documents, which is a violation of the law. After entering the house, they did not explain the reason or investigate clearly who was good or bad, and beat anyone they saw. The civilian's wife and mother-in-law repeatedly explained to them, but the police officer ignored them and beat them both. The civilian's wife was forced to retreat to the front room. The Chinese police officer chased after her. In a desperate situation, she called for help from the window, but the police officer punched her, causing her to fall to the second floor, where she was seriously injured and died. Xu A Jin's nature is inherently violent. The Western police officer, as the head, should have been careful in handling the matter when exercising his duties. The Chinese police officer killed an innocent person, and he is responsible beyond any doubt. The Western police officer is also difficult to shirk his responsibility. A lawsuit has already been filed against the Chinese police officer Xu A Jin, and the Western police officer Peier did not stop Xu A Jin's illegal actions, and his fault cannot be excused. Please ask your lawyers to jointly represent us and send a letter to the Police Department of the Public Works Department for a fair investigation in order to protect the people's lives and to warn against lawlessness. Sincerely, In view of this, we are sending a letter to your office as representatives to clarify the facts and request a fair investigation to protect the people's lives. Sincerely, To the Chief of the Police Department of the Public Works Department,"</p>

<p>The three-story Western-style house at No. 12, Alley 456, Rue Foochow was the location of a large-scale morphine manufacturing operation organized by Ningbo native Zhang Zheng-gao and others. Around 3:00 AM the previous morning, Chinese detectives Wang Runhe and Wang Guangqi of the Hongkou police raided the premises and arrested Jiang Jin-dao from Tongzhou, Tang A-jin, Zhang A-gen, Yu A-xian, the woman Chen Ji-shi, Chen Zhang-shi, all from Ningbo, and others. They also seized morphine manufacturing equipment, chemical apparatus, a large quantity of drugs, raw materials, white powder drugs, heroin, two ledgers, and a truck and taxi used for transportation, taking everything to the police station where the suspects were detained separately. This was previously reported. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case and requested an extension. A portion of the evidence was presented. When questioned, Jiang Jin-dao claimed that a small bag of morphine found on him was purchased by a friend, Wang A-san, because his wife suffered from stomach problems, and he had nothing to do with the operation. He asked for leniency. Tang A-jin confessed to working there for about three weeks, earning twelve yuan per month. The boss was Zhang Zheng-gao, Zhang A-gen was a young assistant, Chen Zhang-shi was his sister, and Chen Ji-shi was a servant. An engineer named Sun Yuan produced over ten liang of morphine every night. Zhang Zheng-gao lived at No. 15, Baolin Lane, Avenue Edward VII, and he frequently came to oversee everything. He did not know the other shareholders. Chen Ji-shi admitted to being a maid, earning five yuan per month, only cooking and doing laundry, and knowing nothing else. Zhang A-gen confessed that Zheng-gao was his father, and he wrote the two ledgers presented as evidence. The court asked him to write a few key words to verify his handwriting. Chen Zhang-shi said that she had come to Shanghai from Ningbo and was temporarily staying at her mother's house at No. 15, Baolin Lane, and knew nothing else. Yu A-xian said that he lived at No. 1, Tongfu Road and was not a shareholder in the operation, and his answers were evasive. Judge Xiao Xie-fen ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation and verification at a later date.</p>

<p>▲Zhang Dan'an Donates a Thousand Books: Zhang Dan'an, a calligrapher from Biling, has many students all over the world. His true script, running script, official script, and seal script each have their own characteristics. He has retired to Shanghai and enjoys calligraphy every day. However, Mr. Zhang is eccentric by nature and never shows his work to others easily. Last year, his close friend Mr. Wu, at the request of a book collector from Japan, offered a thousand taels of silver as a gift to ask for a piece of calligraphy, but Mr. Zhang refused. His high moral character can be seen from this. Recently, due to the repeated requests of relatives and friends, he reluctantly broke the rule and donated a thousand pieces of calligraphy to broaden his circle of friends. Anyone who presents today's newspaper issue to Mr. Zhang to request calligraphy within five feet will be charged a ink fee of one yuan, and a matching couplet with the inscription will be added. This offer is limited to one thousand pieces, and no more will be accepted beyond that. Four screen strips will cost two yuan. Paper will be provided. Mr. Zhang is not using this to make a profit, but only to amuse himself. Those at home and abroad who wish to obtain his calligraphy should send a letter to Mr. Chen Mengdie, c/o Yadong Bank, No. 44 Tianjin Road, Shanghai, or No. 58 Changsheng Street, Nine Acres, with the ink fee enclosed. The reply will be sent within five days.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e180">Reading Plan (3) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>I am very fond of history, especially Chinese history, but because I cannot enter university at present, I plan to study on my own in my spare time. I have written my "Self-Study Plan" below and respectfully request your guidance.</p>
<p>After graduating from middle school, I went to work in society and have been doing so for five years. When I first graduated, I did not like any of the subjects very much, because at that time I only liked to play! After I started working, things gradually changed. The whip of life was constantly lashing me, causing me to live in a state of boredom and pain all day long. So I became fond of studying, in order to make myself feel better mentally. Because I like to get to the bottom of everything, I wanted to study history. This is why I chose history as my subject of study.</p>
<p>I have now read several general national histories, such as the high school national history textbooks of major bookstores and Wang Tongling's "General History of China," but after reading these books, I still cannot get any benefit, because they do not tell me the overall activities and social changes of mankind, or the Chinese nation. They do not let me know the influence or causal relationship of the past on the present. They only tell me the names of some great figures and heroes, how great their abilities are, and how extraordinary their talents are, as if these people are a different kind of people, completely different from us mortals. They only tell me about the changes of dynasties, the transfer of power, such as the decline of the power of eunuchs and noble relatives. They only tell me about domestic and foreign wars, foreign invasions, and so on. As for why this is so, and what the situation was at the time, they never give me any hints.</p>
<p>Later, I also read some history about cultural relics and systems, but it was also chaotic and unsystematic. In short, these books are all condensed versions of large historical materials, not "history."</p>
<p>Now I can no longer rely on these history outlines and other books. I want to study directly from historical materials.</p>
<p>I originally planned to study from ancient times all the way down, but the text of ancient Chinese books is very difficult to understand. Even after reading the annotations, I am still at a loss. Therefore, I feel that in order to study Chinese history, one must first be proficient in philology. So my first step now is to prepare to study "textual studies" and archaeological studies. I plan to do this research for a year.</p>
<p>After I have a rough understanding of these, I will read ancient books, and read Chinese history books one by one in a systematic way (the books I plan to read are detailed in the bibliography).</p>
<p>Although the plan has been set, I have the following questions: First, there is not enough time for research. It is really difficult to study Chinese studies. At first, I thought that textual studies could be mastered soon, but after buying a "Textual Studies" book and reading it, I felt that this thing was not easy either, and it could not be mastered and applied without a long period of study. Then, thinking about the twenty-four histories, which are so many books, I don't know how much time it will take to finish reading them. How can someone like me, who has so little time to read (at most three hours of free time every night), finish reading them? Second, reading textual studies and ancient history (such as "Zizhi Tongjian") is too boring to arouse my interest. Third, the books are insufficient and not enough for research.</p>
<p>With the above points, I have doubts about my reading plan, fearing that it cannot be realized, so I hope your department can solve my difficulties. Or help me make a self-study plan, but I hope you pay attention to my purpose: I do not want to be a historical expert, I only want to understand the past situation of the current society, so that I can understand why the current society is like this.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Standards for Marrying a Wife <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ling</p>
<p>Which man does not marry a wife? Unless he is an unsound cripple. But no one has the leisure to examine what kind of woman is a standard wife? Therefore, many results are unsatisfactory, and their focus is not obtaining a standard wife.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that this issue is worth discussing, especially for young people who are about to get married or have lovers. It is even more urgent to study whether the other party meets the conditions of a standard wife before uniting. Otherwise, it is truly so-called [misleading for life], which can cause considerable harm.</p>
<p>Based on my personal observations, a standard wife must have the following six conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Good Moral Character: As the saying goes, [marrying a wife is about marrying virtue]. If you marry a woman who is a [Hedor Lion's Roar] or [frivolous and unchaste], then what family happiness is there!</p>
<p>(2) Sound Physique: [A sound mother can give birth to a sound child]. What I am saying here is not about being as robust as an athlete, just not being [weak and sickly].</p>
<p>(3) Proper Appearance: A beautiful wife can cause trouble, which has been true since ancient times. Therefore, I think an ordinary-looking wife is also acceptable, as long as she doesn't have pockmarks or scars, cross-eyes, or a crooked mouth.</p>
<p>(4) Does Not Love Being Modern: At most, three parts modern, and must be seven parts old-fashioned. Because the so-called modern decoration costs are not enough for us poor guys to buy a pair of high heels with a month's salary.</p>
<p>(5) Proficient in Writing: Can women with extensive knowledge of Chinese and Western studies really apply what they have learned? Furthermore, it is not that I look down on women's rights, but if you teach your wife to go out to earn money to support the family or support her husband, China has not yet reached this level. So, a basic understanding of writing is enough.</p>
<p>(6) Able to Assist with Household Affairs: The first purpose of marrying a wife is to [continue the family line], and the second purpose is to assist with household affairs. Because the husband is away all day, if the wife is also away all day, or stands by idly, without paying attention to any household affairs, then what can she be called a [good wife]? The above six points are just my personal observations.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Wife <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Lonely Xu Sheng</p>
<p>A fortune teller said: [Wife, wealth, children, and status]. It can be seen that these four things are the treasures that people care about the most; otherwise, why wouldn't the fortune teller use other treasures to cater to people's psychology? I might as well talk about the first treasure: the wife.</p>
<p>Who doesn't have a wife? Who doesn't want to marry a wife? Of course, a wife is an important fellow. Therefore, apart from new people calling their wives [My Love], when ordinary people are in their honeymoon period, who doesn't call them [Baby]? Of course, a wife is a source of comfort in spirit and body, providing warmth and care, sharing the bed, giving birth to sons and daughters—all of which are the wife's due obligations; therefore, ancient people called them [Inner Helper]. Liang Hong and Meng Guang personally wielded the pestle and mortar; Sima Xiangru and Zhuo Wenjun sold wine at the stove; Jing Zhao painted eyebrows, and the romantic stories were passed down; historically, they are all said to be virtuous couples. Even the great American novelist Washington Irving, in his essay "A History of New York," wrote: [It is only in times of distress that a man knows the virtues of his wife]. [When in despair, getting pillow talk, solving my worries; looking around when going out, relatives and old friends, none of them being affectionate, all acting disdainfully; only at home, affection is still the same, still with the air of being uniquely respected, and the spirit is boosted]. Irving was an old man, and he still said such things, which shows that people in China and abroad all regard their wives as treasures.</p>
<p>A wife is indeed a treasure because [wife education] is more practical than any other education. What about mother's education, father's education, brother's education, teacher's education? They can't compare; therefore, [being afraid of one's wife] is an element of a person's success. As the saying goes, [Being afraid of one's wife leads to wealth]. That is the reason. Who doesn't want to get rich, so many people are afraid of their wives. The current widespread wife education is nothing more than [getting rich] and [becoming an official]; perhaps those who get rich and become officials benefit from [wife education]. However, the wife education of the ancients was different from that of today. In the Song Dynasty, there was a man named Yang Pu, and Emperor Zhenzong summoned him to write poetry; he said he couldn't. Zhenzong asked him, "Did anyone write a poem to send you off when you left?" Yang Pu said, "No, only my old wife wrote one, saying: [Rest from your poverty and drunken revelry! Stop your reckless love of poetry! Today, you are being dragged into officialdom; this time, you'll lose your old head]". Zhenzong laughed loudly and let him go without making him an official. The mentality of wives today is completely different from that of the ancients; therefore, husbands rack their brains, desperately making money and scheming in every way, wanting to win a smile from their wives.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Wife <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Hua</p>
<p>[Lock the door when you go out, no fire when you come into the room, no one to make worn-out shoes, no one to mend torn socks, you know the suffering of being without a wife when you have one.] The above is a love song of unmarried people, and my second uncle seemed to sing it when he hadn't married four years ago. Indeed, when a person reaches a certain age, marriage is also a very necessary thing. Besides making shoes and socks for you, the benefits that a wife can give you are that she can comfort you when you are frustrated, and she can help you when you are not capable of doing something.</p>
<p>But marrying a wife is not an easy thing. You have to consider the other person's appearance and pay attention to their inner self. Even if you marry a lover who you like and who likes you, there are still problems. Strindberg's [Love and Bread] describes a clerk in the Council Office who earns two hundred and fifty kronor a month, named Fack, who did not carefully consider the bread problem after marriage and the problem of raising children in advance, and went to marry his lover, Louise. In the end, it turned into a tragedy, and the result was that his wife and son were taken away by his father-in-law, and the creditors took everything from his house: chairs, shelves, mahogany beds, knives, forks, pots, plates, basins, kettles…</p>
<p>The above story shows the reasons for the endless stream of divorce cases in China today!</p>

<p>— Rui Qing</p>
<p>She grew up in a poetic ancient city; she is the daughter of a scholar, so she has received a good education.</p>
<p>She is the gentlest, most beautiful, most sincere, most affectionate, and noblest; a person who is sound in both body and mind.</p>
<p>Her gentleness is neither mediocre nor foolish, nor is it cowardly; she is like a cool breeze after the scorching heat of summer, gently caressing people, making them feel refreshed and comfortable all over.</p>
<p>Her beauty is not decoration, not clothing; she has a shapely figure, a pretty face, rosy skin, elastic muscles, and a smart and lively spirit, so people feel that she is beautiful in every way.</p>
<p>Her sincerity is not hypocrisy, not entanglement; she has no selfish views, she can love and care for her husband meticulously; regardless of joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness, everything is a pure expression of her heart.</p>
<p>Her affection is permanent and unchanging; her nobility is natural and subjective.</p>
<p>Her body is extremely beautiful and healthy; neither fat nor thin, moderate in length. She can exercise, dance, swim, and…</p>
<p>Her knowledge is very accurate: she can write, compose, paint, play music, sing, socialize, sew, cook, raise children, and manage the household… In society, she is a social butterfly; at home, she is a virtuous housewife.</p>
<p>She has grown up in my heart since childhood, and her virtues, talents, and everything else have gradually grown day by day. I cannot forget her for a single day, hour, minute, or second.</p>
<p>But where is she now?</p>
<p>Friends who are dreaming of the joy of getting married! Before you prepare to marry a wife, don't forget to measure yourself. Do you have the ability to solve the bread problem after marriage and the problem of raising children? Otherwise, you will only be acting out a tragedy that Fack and Louise acted out. As for the practical benefits of a wife, you won't get any, so why bother?!</p>

<p>— Bing Hua</p>
<p>That Saturday, I went to Takabashi to play, and when I got home, it was past dinnertime. As soon as I entered the door, my wife's face showed displeasure and she said:</p>
<p>[You must have had fun today].</p>
<p>[Not really...] I answered vaguely, because I knew my wife was angry.</p>
<p>[I thought you wouldn't be back so late, I was afraid your soul had been taken away].</p>
<p>[You always like to say too much, please forgive me this time, I'll come back earlier next time]. I said to my wife in a pleading tone.</p>
<p>[Come back or don't come back, I won't care about you anymore, please find someone else to take care of the household chores]. My wife was still furious.</p>
<p>So the quarrel began.</p>
<p>After three minutes of silence, we were both angry and silent. I smoked a cigarette, and I felt even more annoyed. I ran upstairs to sleep, and although my eyes were closed, I didn't fall asleep.</p>
<p>Not long after, my wife came up too. She saw that I was sleeping with my clothes on, and seemed to feel sorry for my tiredness. She gently took off my leather shoes, took a quilt, and covered me, and put down the curtains. At that time, I pretended to wake up and saw that the anger on my wife's face had long disappeared. I felt relieved.</p>
<p>[Are you still angry with me? Beat me up to vent your anger, okay?] I leaned my head on my wife's body in a coquettish way. [Who is angry with you?... I love you even more now, you know?] My wife said from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>I looked at the clock on the table and it was already ten o'clock.</p>
<p>[I forgot to eat dinner]. We both said in unison.</p>
<p>[The food at home is cold. How about we go out to eat? And then go to Vienna to dance?]</p>
<p>[Whatever...] my wife said, and gave me a sweet, long kiss.</p>
<p>[Oh! You didn't shave your face today, it hurts my face].</p>
<p>My wife said with a smile.</p>
<p>[...]. I also smiled.</p>
<p>In this smile of looking at each other, our husband and wife were still as good as ever.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Talking About Being Afraid of One's Wife <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Le Ye</p>
<p>The debate between male-centered and female-centered has not yet been resolved, and it is not an easy thing to solve. Proponents of women's rights say that Chinese women have been groaning under the oppression of men for thousands of years, and now they want to stand up and liberate themselves. This is not wrong. Indeed, Chinese women have suffered thousands of years of pain under the constraints of ritual education, but men who oppose women's rights say that although Chinese women are constrained by ritual education, this is in name only, but in fact, women's rights are higher than everything. This is not wrong either. [Being afraid of one's husband] is not often heard, but [being afraid of one's wife] is a household name, very common, and has existed since ancient times.</p>
<p>[Being afraid of one's wife] is a very common thing. Now, due to changes in the times, the way [being afraid of one's wife] and [controlling one's husband] has also changed. In the past, most women had bound feet and did not leave the house all year round. Even when they went out, they sat in sedan chairs, with maids and servants protecting them, walking a few streets. How would they know about things outside? Therefore, old-fashioned women controlled their husbands only at home and set a time limit for returning home at night. If there was a violation, they would wait to exercise their power—a queen's command, but the execution of that command could only be limited to within the queen's chamber. It could not extend beyond the chamber. Unless they received a secret report, a man's misdeeds outside could definitely not be controlled by a virago. Now the times are different, and women's great power in foreign affairs has surpassed that of men. Places where men go, such as dancing, swimming, drama, and other entertainment venues, also cannot be without women's footprints. Not only do men become women's advanced followers. During a man's routine work, if he wants to kill time, his wife usually has the right to accompany him, or even has the possibility of forcing her husband to engage in a certain kind of entertainment. Therefore, many men, wanting to engage in irregular entertainment, are unable to do so because of surveillance.</p>
<p>Therefore, now women are constantly monitoring their husbands' actions. As for the men's side, wanting to engage in some improper entertainment, in the past they were afraid of their wives knowing! Now they are afraid of their wives seeing, and the fear is the same, but the method is a bit different.</p>

<p>— MO</p>
<p>Quite by chance, I encountered my old classmate Mr. H, whom I hadn't seen in ten years, on [Mystery Street], which gave me unexpected joy. According to custom, old friends meeting again cannot avoid borrowing cups and plates to tell each other what they have been doing since we last saw each other. I couldn't avoid this custom either, so we went together to the Xin Ya Tea House, which we used to frequent.</p>
<p>We sat down in a quiet corner. We ordered two cups of tea, a few appetizers, and a catty of aged Hua Diao wine. The waiter brought the wine and dishes. We poured wine and chatted casually. We talked about the country's precarious situation, and we also talked about the mother school's precarious state; finally, we talked about the issue of spouses.</p>
<p>[Have you gotten married?] Mr. H asked me.</p>
<p>[I'm ashamed to say! I'm thirty years old, and my wife's position is still vacant.] I answered coyly].</p>
<p>[You are so happy!] Mr. H said with an envious tone. [Happy? I see that the classmates and friends I know all have young, beautiful, and modern wives. In the bright mornings and moonlit evenings, under the shade of trees, in theaters, they live sweet lives together. Some even have a crystallization of love, a lovely little baby, to add to the family's liveliness. And me, besides half a box of luggage and two shelves of old books, what's left is just a stark bachelor. Whenever the night is waning and people are quiet, whenever it's a cold rainy night, how lonely I feel in life, how desolate I feel as a bachelor! Your life, old friend, is truly happy and makes me envious!] After I finished speaking, I took a deep sip of Hua Diao wine, watching Mr. H, waiting for his opinion. Mr. H said with a very sad attitude: [Old friend, you're so smart, how can you only see the joy of marriage? As the saying goes: [Marriage is the tomb of love]! I can now add a transitional phrase: [Marrying a wife is the pronouncement of a fixed-term imprisonment!] Since we parted from school, I was very lucky to find a job that couldn't be considered small in K Province, and the income was not small, so the problem of livelihood was solved, and I went to look for my future beautiful wife.</p>
<p>[Soon], Mr. H took a puff of smoke and continued: [A new acquaintance in K Province introduced me to a certain lady who graduated from a local girls' school. Ms. Someone, my current wife, at that time, was indeed young and beautiful, and her knowledge and talent were not bad. So, I, who had been craving a woman for a long time, accelerated from acquaintance to friend to lover to marriage. And the execution of my fixed-term imprisonment also began at that time.</p>
<p>[Before I got married, my life was so comfortable, my actions were so free. Once I got married, it was as if a person engaged in political activities had encountered a secret agent, and I was being monitored by my wife everywhere. This can also be forgiven. What's most unbearable is that the numbers in my bookkeeping also underwent drastic changes. At first, it changed from surplus to break-even, and later it turned into a deficit. According to my wife's academic ability, under these circumstances, she could have gone out and done some kind of job to make up for my shortcomings. However, labor should only be done by the husband. Her job every day is just to think about how to dress up, how to make new clothes, how to boast to the same sex, and how to please the opposite sex. I, for the sake of women, can only endure like a dumb person eating huanglian.</p>
<p>[Two years later, that son, who was praised as the crystallization of love, was born. That's right, sons are something that adorn the shortcomings of a family in other people's homes. But for me, it's like a prisoner who has served his term and is released from prison committing a crime again, and therefore sentenced to life imprisonment. What hiring a nanny, holding a full moon ceremony, and all the burdens, put pressure on my upright body and turned me into a hunchback. [Now, my dog is already of school age. If I don't let him go to school, I'll be failing in my responsibility as a father; but if I let him go to school, under the modern commercialized school system, you can't go to school without money. Because of all this, I have long wanted to escape from prison. But you, my old friend, are craving the taste of sugar-coated poison, how unwise!]</p>
<p>After Mr. H finished speaking, those worldly eyes stared at me terribly, waiting for my ideal rebuttal. I could only be like under the guidance of a dignified parent, just saying Yes and OK.</p>

<p>CUHK Dean of Academic Affairs</p>
<h3 id="e191">Sun Benwen Resigns: The Process <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Sun Benwen, the Dean of Academic Affairs at Central University, has also been a professor in the Department of Sociology at CUHK for many years. He is determined to study academics and lacks interest in administrative affairs. When Luo Jialun took over as the president of CUHK two years ago, he asked Sun to concurrently serve as the Dean of Academic Affairs. At that time, CUHK was in the aftermath of the turmoil. For the sake of the school's future and feeling Luo's sincere entrustment, Sun agreed to serve concurrently temporarily. In the year or so, the school has been rectified and stabilized, so he repeatedly resigned from the concurrent position of Dean of Academic Affairs to Luo, specializing in teaching in the Department of Sociology, so as to concentrate on academic research. Because Sun's intention to resign was very firm, Luo had no choice but to approve his resignation from the concurrent position, and hired Chen Jianxiao, a professor of educational psychology, to succeed as the Dean of Academic Affairs. In addition, Huang Jianzhong, the dean of the College of Education, was also repeatedly urged by Luo when he took over, before he agreed to temporarily serve as the dean concurrently. At the end of each semester, he firmly resigned from the authorities. At the end of this semester, Luo was unable to retain him any longer, so he asked him to specialize in teaching as a professor in the Department of Education and the Department of Philosophy, so that he could concentrate on academic research, in line with his personal interests. It is heard that Ai Wei has been asked to succeed as the dean of the College of Education. Ai has been a professor in the Department of Psychology at the school since Dongda.

<h3 id="e192">Emphasis on Cultivating Water Conservancy Talents <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Instructing domestic engineering colleges to expand water conservancy engineering courses</p>
<p>And establishing departments of water conservancy engineering in relevant engineering colleges</p>
<p>丨丨Proposal from the North China Water Conservancy Commission丨丨</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating: "Regarding the approval of the Ministry of Interior's letter No. 22 regarding land matters, it states, 'This Ministry has convened the Second National Internal Affairs Conference, and all resolutions adopted have been reported or circulated separately. Now, the North China Water Conservancy Commission has proposed that the conference recommend that the Ministries of Interior and Education emphasize the cultivation of water conservancy talents and establish a hydraulic engineering museum. This has been recorded in the minutes of the conference and sent to the Ministry of Interior for handling. The success of any undertaking depends on the planning and execution of specialized talents, and the training of talents should be based on the needs of society. Water conservancy is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and there are many urgent matters to be addressed. The original proposal suggests expanding courses related to water conservancy engineering in domestic engineering colleges and establishing departments of water conservancy engineering as appropriate to train technical personnel to undertake this arduous task, which is indeed an urgent priority. Furthermore, water conservancy is closely related to the interests of the people, and it is essential to impart basic knowledge. The original proposal to establish a hydraulic engineering museum is also an important plan. However, the equipment is complex and difficult to implement. The Ministry suggests collecting and displaying models, photos, and atlases of hydraulic engineering in museums or exhibition halls related to public education, which would be easier to implement and have the same effect. Regarding the above two items, we request that your Ministry review them and instruct relevant departments to implement them earnestly to promote education and water conservancy. The original proposal is enclosed for your review and handling. Thank you.' A copy of the original proposal has been sent to the Ministry. It is imperative to cultivate water conservancy talents and display models, photos, and atlases of hydraulic engineering. In addition to issuing separate orders and replies, a copy of the original proposal is enclosed to instruct the relevant departments to refer to the local situation and needs and handle it accordingly. This order, with the attached proposal (omitted)."</p>

<p>▲Positive reviews from German newspapers</p>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) Painter Xu Beihong brought more than forty of his works to Berlin. Introduced by the President of the Berlin National Academy of Fine Arts, the greatest contemporary German painter, he was able to hold a public exhibition in the "Berlin Artists' Association". The exhibition started in mid-November and lasted for several weeks. People in Berlin paid close attention to it.</p>
<p>The art world was particularly excited, and many reviews were published in major newspapers. The Berliner Tageblatt, the most widely circulated newspaper in Berlin, devoted half a page in its illustrated supplement on November 28 to reproduce five of Mr. Xu's animal paintings (Jiu Fang Gao, Lazy Cat, Amazement, Chicken, and Poetic Interpretation of the Six Dynasties). It also published a lengthy critique entitled "Animals from China", praising Mr. Xu's vivid and powerful depiction of animals, which were proud and unconventional. Two excerpts are translated below: "[...] Yes, it is precisely this pride that distinguishes them from ordinary beasts. They possess a unique life sentiment. The horse led to Jiu Fang Gao stands tall and proud, its eyes and nostrils expressing its life force, even more so than the posture of its body. And the eyes of this horse connoisseur, while sharply scrutinizing, are also full of the same noble and proud expression. He is full of passionate greatness." "[The animals in the paintings jump and run, as if they are all preparing for a new action. It is usually difficult to paint animals because it is hard to express their agility in such a lighthearted way. It is even harder to make them have flesh and blood with ink and oil paint, but it has been successfully achieved here."</p>

<p>The observation report on education in Anhui Province by Li Ximou, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education, is nearing completion. The original text is very long, and excerpts are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e195">㈠ Current Situation of Secondary Schools <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>One provincial senior high school, eight middle schools from the First to the Eighth, six girls' middle schools, one girls' normal school, one girls' secondary vocational school, nine secondary vocational schools from the First to the Ninth, three rural normal schools, one joint Anqing Six Counties Middle School, one Ning District junior middle school, Tongcheng County Middle School and county junior middle schools in various counties, and Xuan Cheng County Girls Junior Middle School, totaling twenty-four schools, four county secondary vocational schools, four private middle schools, fifteen junior middle schools, one girls' middle school, two girls' junior middle schools, one Wuhu Vocational School. There are a total of eighty-one secondary schools for both boys and girls in the province, with twenty-eight provincial schools, thirty joint and county schools, and twenty-three private schools.</p>
<h3 id="e196">㈡ Current Situation of Education Funding and Independent Plan <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Before the twelfth year of the Republic (1923), education funding in Anhui Province was uniformly allocated directly to schools by the province based on the approved budget. However, due to frequent shortfalls in fiscal revenue, arrears accumulated over the years, especially for administrative and other expenses. After several twists and turns, the province followed the independent model of Jiangsu and designated cigarette taxes as special funds. At that time, as it was a new initiative, the tax revenue was minimal. It was not until after the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), when tax rates were increased, that education funding gradually stabilized. Coincidentally, the central government reorganized finances and divided national and local taxes, and the cigarette tax was reformed into a unified tax, resulting in the loss of supplementary education funding. Later, due to the efforts of people throughout the province, the finance and education departments went to Beijing to negotiate, and the central government agreed to subsidize 100,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan per year. Currently, most of the annual education funding in the province relies on this subsidy. The remainder is allocated by the finance department from provincial funds according to the approved budget. The allocation of provincial education funds for the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933) is as follows: 158,180 yuan for education administration expenses (plus 9,000 yuan for temporary expenses), 572,333 yuan for higher education expenses (plus 36,000 yuan for temporary expenses), 1,325,509 yuan for secondary education expenses, 335,580 yuan for primary education expenses, 100,944 yuan for social education expenses, and 78,790 yuan for various education undertakings expenses (plus 10,200 yuan for temporary expenses). Regarding the procedures for claiming and disbursing funds, when the cigarette tax was designated as special funds in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the Jiangsu province's independent model was followed, and a Education Funding Management Office was established by the finance and education departments as the education funding management agency. The collection, disbursement, and auditing of tax revenues were all managed by this office. Since the cigarette tax was taken over by the central government, the source of education funding has been divided into provincial funds and central government subsidies. The responsibilities of the office have also changed accordingly. The monthly management and disbursement procedures are summarized below for provincial education agencies, except for universities, which are handled directly by the provincial treasury: A. The central government subsidy is claimed directly from the Ministry of Finance by the management office on a monthly basis. The education department then distributes the funds according to the monthly budget of each agency and issues a list to the management office for disbursement. B. Provincial funds are claimed from the finance department by the management office. The education department then distributes the funds according to the amount of funds received each time and issues a list to the management office for disbursement. (The province also has review procedures for the reimbursement of expenses and the organization of the auditing committee, which are omitted here.) The history of the independent education funding movement in the province is as follows: At the provincial education administration conference held in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), there was a proposal to unify education funding. In April of the same year, a Special Education Funds Management Committee was organized, designating 440,000 yuan from the land tax of Tongcheng and other ten counties, 600,000 yuan from the salt river and other customs duties, and a total of 1.53 million yuan from the tea customs duties as education funding. Later, the financial authorities advocated the unification of the treasury, overturning the previous plan. In July of the twelfth year of the Republic (1923), due to the efforts of people in the province, the provincial government designated the cigarette tax as special education funds. In April of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the provincial political affairs committee established the Education Funding Management Office as the special management agency for these funds. In February of the seventeenth year of the Republic (1928), the Ministry of Finance reformed the cigarette tax into a unified tax and subsidized 100,000 yuan per month from the central government to compensate for it. As for the independent education funding plan, according to the opinions of the provincial education administration authorities, there is no other way except to raise additional salt tax. The salt in Anhui Province is divided into three regions: the central part of Anhui sells Huai salt, with an annual volume of 800,000 packages. Previously, an additional three yuan was added to each package, generating an annual revenue of over 2 million yuan, which has now been taken back by the Ministry of Finance. The southern part of Anhui sells Zhejiang salt, and the northern part of Anhui sells Ji salt, and there is no such additional tax. The education authorities of the province believe that if the example of central Anhui could be followed and additional taxes could be added uniformly to be used as special education funds for the province, not only would the tax source be stable and the revenue reliable, but the quantity would also be greatly beneficial to future development.</p>
<h3 id="e197">㈢ New Allocation of Provincial Schools from the Twenty-Second Year of the Republic (1933) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The current secondary education funding in Anhui Province, as listed in the budget for the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), is 1,325,500 yuan. Among them, funding for ordinary middle schools accounts for slightly more than 39 percent, funding for normal schools accounts for slightly more than 30 percent, and funding for vocational schools accounts for slightly less than 30 percent. In order to meet the standards for the allocation of secondary education stipulated by the Ministry, one side intends to gradually increase funding, and the other side intends to increase or decrease or change the number and nature of schools. The provincial middle schools and normal schools are planned to be reorganized and divided into six normal school districts. ㈠ The names of all schools should be prefixed with the words "Provincial". ㈡ Each normal school district, except for the first district, which has separate normal schools for boys and girls, will have one normal school, all with separate departments for boys and girls, with classes taught separately. The fifth and sixth districts will also have one simple rural normal school each. ㈢ Each normal school district, except for the first district, which has separate senior and junior high schools, will have one middle school combining senior and junior high schools. The fourth district will also have one junior high school. ㈣ The original four normal schools, twelve middle schools combining senior and junior high schools, one senior high school, and two junior high schools, totaling nineteen schools, will be reorganized into seven normal schools, two simple rural normal schools, eight middle schools combining senior and junior high schools, one senior high school, and four junior high schools, totaling twenty-two schools. According to the latest planned distribution of secondary schools, ordinary senior high schools will have one senior high school in the provincial capital, Huizhou Middle School and the senior high school ordinary classes of Wuhu Middle School in southern Anhui, Fengyang Middle School and the senior high school ordinary classes of Yingzhou Middle School in northern Anhui, and the senior high school classes of Luzhou Middle School in central Anhui. There will be three girls' senior high school classes, one in Anqing, one in Wuhu, and one in Fengyang, distributed in southern, central, and northern Anhui, which seems appropriate. As for how to reorganize vocational schools and vocational departments in the future, so as to take both the principles stipulated by the Ministry and the needs of the local area into consideration, there is no different plan. However, according to the division of the province's administrative regions, there have been proposed vocational departments suitable for each region, such as agriculture (rice, wheat, cotton, flowers, vegetables, agricultural tools, miscellaneous grains, horticulture, landscaping), animal husbandry (cattle, bees, poultry), forestry, sericulture, tobacco, civil engineering, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e198">㈣ New Allocation Plan for Middle School Funding Starting from the Twenty-Second Year of the Republic (1933) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Judging from the total amount of secondary education funding in Anhui Province in the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), the percentage of its allocation, except for the funding for vocational schools, which does not meet the standards stipulated by the Ministry, is generally in line with the standards set by the Ministry of Education. According to the Measures for the Establishment and Funding Allocation Standards for Secondary Schools in Various Provinces and Cities stipulated by the Ministry of Education, starting from the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934), the newly added funding for secondary education in various provinces and cities should be used primarily for vocational and normal school funding. Those who are unable to increase it should gradually reduce the corresponding amount of middle school funding from the original funding to expand vocational education and normal education. It is found that the funding for normal schools in Anhui Province has already exceeded the standards stipulated by the Ministry. If the total amount cannot be increased, there will be no need to expand in the future. Currently, the most important expansion is vocational education funding. However, according to the current financial situation of Anhui Province, it is difficult to greatly increase education funding. If it is entirely dependent on newly added funding, it is doubtful whether the standards stipulated by the Ministry can be reached in six years. However, since the middle school funding in the province in the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933) is only equivalent to the standards stipulated by the Ministry, it is also unreasonable to gradually reduce it for the expansion of vocational education. Therefore, the province has no other way to expand vocational education funding except to transfer it from the education funding itself. It is found that the province has accumulated more than 40,000 yuan in education funding for studying abroad over the years. If the number of self-funded students in Europe and the United States is reduced starting from the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934), it is estimated that the current standards stipulated by the Ministry can be reached by the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937).</p>
<p>The Education Department of Jiangsu Province Instructs All Middle Schools</p>
<h3 id="e199">Five Matters That Accountants Should Implement <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Education Department of Jiangsu Province instructs all middle schools: "It is found that the system of accountants appointed by the Department has been implemented since the beginning of this academic year. Currently, in the initial stages, many have not been able to thoroughly implement the measures stipulated by the Department. Now, the first semester is about to end. The Department hopes that the principals and accountants of all schools will earnestly implement the following items: 1. The accountant is appointed by the Education Department to oversee the accounting affairs of the school and practice sites. Except for consulting with the principal on handling matters, they are not subject to interference from other staff members within the school to maintain the spirit of accounting independence. 2. The principal and the accountant shall jointly bear full responsibility for the economic affairs of the school and practice sites. All expenses of the school and practice sites shall not be disbursed unless approved by the principal and the accountant in advance. Receipts for all collections should be jointly stamped by the principal and the accountant. 3. When the administrative office of the school or practice workshop pre-claims funds from the accountant for miscellaneous expenses, each time shall not exceed one hundred yuan. A second pre-claim shall not be made until the funds pre-claimed the first time have been settled. Moreover, uses of five yuan or more, or those outside the budget scope, shall still be subject to approval by the principal and the accountant before disbursement. Otherwise, the accountant may deduct the expense. 4. Income funds from practice sites shall be turned over to the accountant at any time for registration and safekeeping, and shall not be retained by the site for other purposes. The accountant shall also conduct thorough audits at any time. If it is discovered that collections are not turned over in a timely manner, it shall be considered as concealment by the handler, and the principal shall be immediately informed for disciplinary action. If the circumstances are more serious, the Department shall be directly notified for handling. 5. The principal shall fully assist the accountant in exercising their functions within the prescribed scope. They should especially strive to eliminate obstacles and assist in the progress of reforming past accounting practices. If the above items cannot be earnestly implemented by each school, the principal shall be deemed negligent and the accountant shall be deemed to have failed in their duties, and they shall bear corresponding responsibility. The Department will conduct inspections at any time and will not tolerate any pretense. In addition to distributing separately, this order is hereby issued to the principal of the school for compliance. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e200">Chen Guofu and Others Initiate the Organization of the Chinese Cultural Advancement Association <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>▲Creating a Frontline for Cultural Revolution</p>
<p>▲Founders' Meeting Scheduled to be Held in Shanghai</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, and others, deeply aware that the pro-construction culture and the Proletarian culture are sufficient to undermine the Three Principles of the People's political and economic revolution, have initiated the organization of the Chinese Cultural Advancement Association to create a frontline for cultural revolution. A founders' meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai. The origins of its establishment, its organizational purpose, and the names of the founders are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Origins of Establishment　As the times evolve, the relationship between culture and politics and economy becomes increasingly inseparable. Politics and economy are the driving forces of culture, and culture is the nurturer of politics and economy. Moreover, in another sense, politics and economy have the power to promote culture, while culture can determine the form of future politics and economy. Often, culture leads by tens or hundreds of years before the form of politics and economy is completed. Or a culture arises in one place, while the politics and economy of another place is also subject to its influence. For example, Rousseau's theory of natural human rights and Marx's theory of capital both shine in different times and countries, which is the most obvious example. Therefore, the influence of a superior culture is greater than the power of political and economic conquest. For example, the emerging Soviet Russia, Fascist Italy, and even countries like Germany and Turkey are all engaged in cultural innovation at the same time as they transform their political and economic forms, which is based on this understanding. Our Mr. Sun Yat-sen also vigorously advocated cultural revolution at the same time as he worked hard for political and economic revolution, in order to enable the culture of the Three Principles of the People to promote each other with the politics and economy of the Three Principles of the People, and to complete the highest stage of revolution in which politics, economy, and culture are united. However, since the Kuomintang came to power in recent years, it has paid too much attention to politics and economy and neglected culture, so that the transformation of politics and economy cannot correspond to the transformation of culture. The feudal culture has stood firm and defended its solid fortress, while the Proletarian culture that usurps its place has taken the opportunity to invade, forming a situation of the guest dominating the host. However, without cultural revolution, how can we promote the success of political and economic revolution? Without a united front of cultural activists, how can we cope with cultural struggles? We are deeply aware that feudal culture and Proletarian culture are sufficient to undermine the Three Principles of the People's political and economic revolution, and we have the ambition to form a revolutionary cultural frontline. Therefore, we must take it upon ourselves to organize a cultural frontline of the Three Principles of the People. This is the reason for the initiation of the Chinese Cultural Advancement Association.</p>
<p>▲Organizational Purpose　㈠ This Association takes creating a cultural revolution frontline as its sole mission. Anyone who has the ambition of cultural revolution, whether an organization or an individual, can become a member of this Association. However, organizations are limited to those involved in education, publishing, news, film, drama, singing, dancing, painting, and illustration. ㈡ Before the government applies totalitarianism to cultural undertakings, this Association will infiltrate the meaning of self-regulation by organizations into its organization to achieve the purpose of organizing a cultural frontline. ㈢ This Association will establish various cultural undertakings to expand the purpose of cultural movements, such as establishing schools, newspapers, bookstores, theaters, and publishing regular and irregular publications. ㈣ This Association will establish various social and mutual aid organizations to enable groups or individuals joining the Association to maintain close contact and cooperation to achieve its purpose. Although the above is only a summary, the aim of our people is already clearly visible. We now offer twelve points of enthusiasm and hope that organizations and individuals engaged in cultural movements will actively participate and jointly accomplish the great task of cultural revolution. ▲Names of Founders　Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Daofan, Yu Jingtang, Cheng Tianfang, Yu Hongjun, Huang Boqiao, Ye Xiufeng, Cheng Zhongxing, Xu Shaodi, Song Diao, Wu Kaixian, Bai Chuan, Tong Hangbai, Ding Mocun, Li Zhaoli, Huang Xiong, Xuan Yi, Jiang Jianbai, Pan Gongbi, Zhu Xinong, He Xiya, Dong Xian Guang, Huang Tianpeng, Ma Chonggan, Fang Huanru, Qian Cangshuo, Xue Guangqian, Hu Pu'an, Tang Huimin, Chen Baohua, Tang Zeng, Zheng Zhengqiu Shao Zuiweng, Xu Shidan, Xu Xingchu, Xu Zexiang and more than one hundred people.</p>
<p>▲Meeting Scheduled The association is scheduled to hold a founders' meeting in Shanghai on the 24th of this month. An urgent notice was issued yesterday, stating, "It is hereby announced that a founders' meeting will be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th of January at No. 66 on the Third Ma Road. We hope that you will attend on time to participate in this grand event. This announcement serves as an invitation in lieu of a separate letter."</p>

<p>▲Instructing Universities to Discontinue Unnecessary Departments</p>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency, Local Dispatch) The Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that there are many universities in the country that are run seriously and meet the Ministry's regulations, but there are also not a few that are mediocre and lack proper equipment, has been actively rectifying them in recent years. It has recently sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations to ensure that they meet the Ministry's regulations and increase educational effectiveness. There has been significant success. It is now reported that a certain school still has a certain department that is not run completely, and the current situation in the country does not need this type of talent. Based on the inspector's report, the Ministry has decided to instruct several schools to temporarily suspend the department. It is reported that the circular has already been issued, but the schools that have received this instruction have not yet made any statement.</p>

<p>▲Pudong Middle School: Pudong Middle School, renowned in this city for its science programs, has seen improvements in its administration since Lin Zhongke took over as principal. The school has become more impressive. This semester, the entrance examination for new students was extremely rigorous. The admission brochure states that those who are not accustomed to a strict lifestyle and are unwilling to work hard need not apply. Recently, the school has also placed greater emphasis on Chinese and foreign languages and physical education and has newly hired several mathematics and science teachers. The school has won championships in cross-country and soccer finals. Because it is located in Pudong, it is rarely disturbed by the noise of the city, which is beneficial to the physical and mental development of the students.</p>
<p>▲Guo Xiang Women's Vocational School: Guo Xiang Women's Vocational School, a private institution located on Route Paul Beau in the French Concession of this city, has been operating for several years since its establishment. Ms. Hua Xunyang, the principal, manages the school strictly, resulting in remarkable achievements. Since Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Wu Xingya, Wang Jialie, and Chu Minyi have served as school directors, the school's foundation has become even more solid. In addition to being registered with the Education Bureau, it is currently undergoing the formal registration process. Currently, it offers a senior high school commerce program (first year), junior high school (first and second years), and an affiliated elementary school (grades one through six). The current semester concluded the other day. The next semester will begin on the 17th of this month, and applications for transfer students in elementary and secondary schools will be accepted. A large number of free student slots are also designated, and it is reported that registration is very active.</p>
<p>▲Minsheng Girls' Elementary School: Minsheng Girls' Elementary School, located on Route Joffre near Rue Baron Gros, has been established for twenty-three years. Many outstanding women have come from this school. In recent years, it has strived for improvement, with teaching focusing on practical application. This semester, due to a surge in student enrollment, Ms. Gu Ci, a teacher from Anhui Experimental Elementary School, has been hired to teach classes. Therefore, the future development is immeasurable.</p>
<p>▲Ziqiang Elementary School: Ziqiang Elementary School, located at the intersection of Gordon Road and Robison Road in western Shanghai, has been established for five years. Under the careful planning of Principal Shen Yongke, it has complete facilities and outstanding achievements and has long been registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. It has recently been reported that student enrollment has increased significantly, and the original school buildings are no longer sufficient. Therefore, starting this semester, a new school building has been opened on the east side of the Zizhong Clock on Wuda Road in western Shanghai, in three newly built Western-style buildings with a sports field to facilitate the physical and mental development of children. In recent days, the registration of new students has been very active, and the admission procedures are still being handled at the original school building. The school is scheduled to open on February 1st.</p>

<p>丨Result: 2-1丨</p>
<p>Slippery field diminishes performance</p>
<p>Yesterday, amidst howling winds and biting cold, the You You Football Team defeated the British Navy 2-1 at the China Baseball Field. This was a scene from the Western Union First Division League. The Navy's skills were mediocre and not worth mentioning. If the field had not been so slippery, diminishing the performance, the score difference would not have been so narrow. In the first half, You You played with great vigor, scoring two goals in a row. In the second half, the Navy rallied and scored one goal, resulting in a final score of 2-1. The performance of both teams is as follows:</p>

<p>After the two teams took their positions and the silver whistle blew, the You You forwards immediately adopted an aggressive offensive strategy. Staces made three crucial saves on the center-back line. The two Navy fullbacks, Aas and Edwards, under heavy pressure, still mustered their remaining strength to resist the You You attack, slightly diminishing its momentum. Han and Herbert found openings and frequently probed the You You defense. Jiang Shanqing stood firm, displaying a fierce demeanor. Chen Jiaqiu secretly provided support, and Nansen, receiving his assistance, penetrated the heavily guarded area and delivered a beautiful cross. Sun "Iron Leg" arrived at just the right moment and kicked the ball into the net, bringing smiles to the faces of three hundred fans.</p>

<p>Immediately after the kickoff, the Navy launched a fierce attack. Walker broke through the crowd and shot diagonally at the goal. Tang Yongchun reacted quickly, diving to block the shot and avert the danger. Huang Ruihua received the ball and passed it to Chen Huitang. Edwards failed to intercept effectively, resulting in a corner kick. Yongsen delivered the corner kick, and Edwards, attempting to clear the ball, inadvertently sent it forward. Liang Shutang intercepted it from the side and passed it to Sun Huipai, who demonstrated his 400-meter sprint speed, quickly breaking into the opponent's defensive line and crossing the ball to the center. Zhong Yongsen rushed to the scene, leaped into the air, and headed the ball into the net, leaving the Navy trailing 2-0 at halftime.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Situation Becomes Quiet <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>After the lemon break, the Navy showed renewed energy, and the offensive and defensive balance began to improve. Staces remained active, closely guarding Sun "Iron Leg" with great composure. As a result, the You You forwards appeared disorganized. Chen Huitang seemed immature, missing two excellent opportunities. The Navy forwards lacked coordination and relied solely on individual bravery, falling short of success. As time passed, the situation became quiet, with nothing particularly exciting to report. Xi Zhong and others seemed content to relax and be lazy, as if victory was already assured and no extra effort was needed.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Goal Falls <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>After a long period of chaotic play without any highlights, Staces repeatedly encouraged his teammates in the middle. Bye and Zhong Yongsen made simultaneous moves, while Edwards circled around to provide flanking support. The ball entered the center and was obtained by Robertson, who ran towards the You You penalty area. Liang Shutang turned to intercept, but Robertson passed to Walker, who passed it back into the center. Han Herbert advanced a few steps and powerfully kicked the ball. Tang Yongchun reached out to block, barely touching the ball, but it still went into the net. Afterwards, You You launched two fierce attacks on the opponent's defense, but they were unable to score. The game ended with a score of 2-1.</p>

<p>Due to improper scheduling, some teams in the Western Union First Division have already completed the first cycle and are advancing into the second, while others have only played seven or eight matches and have not yet finished the first cycle. Judging from the current situation, the French Chamber of Commerce still has seven matches remaining. With a record of ten wins and one loss, there should be no problem for them to secure the championship. Some say that the Tung Wah Chinese Athletic Association may be able to defeat the French Chamber of Commerce, but it will not be easy to shake their position. The Chinese Athletic Association has four losses and one draw, and their hopes are gone. Tung Wah and the Western Police still have a glimmer of hope, but Tung Wah's fighting spirit often cannot be sustained, as evidenced by their match against Jinan University. If they can remain undefeated in the future and hope that the French Chamber of Commerce loses to other teams, then Tung Wah may still be able to make a comeback and seize the championship. Jinan University is unstable due to the ongoing student unrest, and with strong opponents ahead, they cannot be optimistic. You You is full of vitality and has unlimited hope.</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Marriage Scandal of Lu Ming, National Games Shot Put Champion <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Abandoning His Wife and Children</p>
<p>Engaged to Ms. Liu Jinggui</p>
<p>Suddenly Married Ms. Teng Shuang</p>
<p>According to the Peiping Jingbao on the 19th of this month, Lu Ming, the shot put champion of last year's National Games, represented our country at the Far Eastern Games when he was at Nankai Middle School in Tianjin. Later, he transferred to Shanghai Jiaotong University, and his reputation has not diminished. He has been to the Far East four times and is now thirty-four years old. After returning from the National Games in Nanjing, he married Ms. Teng Shuang, a female athlete from Peiping, just two weeks later. Currently, Lu Ming is still employed at the Xiahuayuan Station of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau. Yesterday, Ms. Liu Jinggui sent a letter from Xuanhua to Peiping, recounting the details of her engagement to Lu Ming in Xuanhua and stating that she will file a lawsuit. The original letter is disclosed below for the public to judge: Fellow countrymen, please be aware of this inhuman person. Most people who pay attention to sports news know him. He is Lu Ming, the shot put champion of last year's National Games. Ugh, thankfully he is just a shot put champion. If his status were any higher, who knows what kind of evil he would commit. This Lu Ming was originally a</p>
<p>Country Bumpkin. His parents, hoping for their son's success, used the money they earned from hard labor to support his education. Who knew that once he entered the city, he would have strange ideas and try to be modern because he had a small reputation in the sports world. Alas, [modernity, modernity, how many sins in the world are born from this!] The first problem on his mind was that his old wife was not fashionable enough, and he wanted to have a romance. He went home and disregarded his parents' heartache and his wife's old love, driving his wife and children out of the house. The woman's family was ordinary and dared not speak out, and they settled for some alimony. This is the trend of the times, and divorce is free, so this is not much. Immediately after the divorce was the</p>
<p>Pursuit of a Target. He ran into snags everywhere. Because these things would damage the reputation of you gentlemen, I won't go into detail. Finally, he met Ms. Teng in Zhangjiakou. This woman, with discerning eyes, actually fell in love with him. We can imagine how flattered he was. But not long after, he was about to change his mind about Ms. Teng, so he ran to Xuanhua and asked his friends to introduce him to women. He earnestly told others that "women from other places are simply unreliable and no longer talk about love." Then he told everything about Ms. Teng in detail. His friends, listening to his</p>
<p>Sweet Talk, thought he was sincere and had no other intentions, so they tried to help him. One of them, who had once taught me, introduced me to him. I have never been one for socializing and knew nothing about Lu Ming's history. But I trusted my teacher completely and without error, so I consulted my uncle and a cousin (who were both Lu Ming's friends). As a result, everyone agreed, and with the parents arranging the marriage, I got engaged to him. It was a surprise when I found out about his marriage to Ms. Teng in the newspaper on November 1st of last year. When I got this news, I began to suspect Lu Ming's character. On the one hand, he</p>
<p>Was Engaged to Me, and on the other hand, he married someone else. He married someone else, so I was mystified by his trick of bullying the weak. Soon he came to me and said, "My marriage to Ms. Teng was forced and not my intention at all," so he still asked me to fulfill the marriage contract. But later I learned that Ms. Teng had agreed to bear a portion of his ex-wife's alimony. Ah, I understood. He wanted to marry two women at the same time, but could I agree to such a request? He cried and begged me, but I refused him several times. Seeing that this trick didn't work, he asked others to mediate to</p>
<p>Cancel the Engagement, but I didn't allow it. How could I tolerate such a social parasite and beast in human clothing? I have my own way. Well, this is how he, the "shot put champion," sold his love and personality, and the person he deceived was a student of his friend. I can't help but recall Chairman Lin's advice to athletes to pay attention to morality. Liu Jinggui tearfully reports.</p>
<p>The Third Replay of the Skota Cup Creates a Huge Wave</p>

<p>In the Skota Cup second-week third replay between La克斯 and the Italian Navy, La克斯 eliminated the Italian Navy 3-1. However, at the end of the match, a huge wave of violence against the referee occurred. The victim was Lieutenant Li Te, the vice president of the Western Union Football Association. His clothes were torn, and his watch was almost stolen, creating a major stain on the Western football world. This shows that violence on the football field is not limited to Chinese people.</p>
<p>Also, in another international football semi-final yesterday, England eliminated Scotland 4-1. England will now face the Jewish team in the final.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Italian Navy Causes Trouble with Violent Behavior <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Italian Navy players acted violently, so the Western Union Association paid close attention to them. After two draws with La克斯, the first at 2-2 and the second at 1-1, yesterday was the third replay at the Hongkou Park Football Field. To ensure the seriousness of the matter, the Western Union Association specially sent its vice president, Li Te, to personally referee the match, with Ma Xu'er and Bo Tuo as linesmen. Both men are also important referees in the Association. More than a dozen Western Union Association officials also attended. As a result, La克斯 eliminated the Italian Navy 3-1. However, the Italian Navy became angry due to the defeat. After the match, they surrounded Li Te, saying that the match time was insufficient and that there were still seven minutes left. Some tried to pull off his watch. Then, they used fists and feet, tearing Li Te's clothes to pieces. Fortunately, the Navy officers and police arrived in time to defuse the situation. The three players who started the violence are said to face serious punishment from the Western Union Association. As for the match itself, the wind was very strong yesterday. La克斯 took advantage of the wind in the first half and scored three goals in a row. In the second half, the Italian Navy's counterattack was ineffective. Near the end of the match, they scored one goal, making the final score 3-1.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was another international cup semi-final between England and Scotland held at Shen Yuan. The result was 4-1, with Scotland being eliminated. England controlled the entire match yesterday, but the performance was greatly hampered because the field had not dried after the snow. Scotland scored first, but England followed with three goals, making it 3-1. In the second half, England scored another goal, making the final score 4-1.

<p>Lincoln and South China Association Suffer Successive Defeats</p>
<p>Wales and St. Joseph's Rise to the Top</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Special Dispatch) Last week, there were significant changes in Hong Kong football. The seemingly invincible Lincoln Army suffered a major defeat, losing 4-1 to Wales. The highly anticipated South China Association lost 2-1 to the mediocre Artillery team. St. Joseph's and the British Navy were originally on equal footing, and the outcome was difficult to predict. In the end, St. Joseph's won 2-0. The results of these three matches had a major impact on the championship prospects. Hong Kong's 3-1 victory over the Western Association was not significant. The latest trends are described below:</p>
<p>Team Name Matches Played Wins Draws Losses Goals For Goals Against Points</p>
<p>Lincoln 14 10 1 3 31 16 21</p>
<p>St. Joseph's 12 9 2 1 32 13 20</p>
<p>British Navy 12 8 2 2 38 19 18</p>
<p>South China Association 12 8 1 3 32 13 17</p>
<p>Wales 10 8 0 2 37 14 16</p>
<p>Chinese Association 12 5 0 7 30 36 10</p>
<p>Hong Kong Association 13 5 1 7 30 35 11</p>
<p>Kowloon Association 11 3 1 7 17 27 7</p>
<p>Police 12 3 1 8 17 22 7</p>
<p>Lancashire 8 2 1 5 11 19 5</p>
<p>Artillery 12 3 0 9 18 30 6</p>
<p>Four Seas 13 1 0 12 21 54 2</p>
<p>The match between South China and the Artillery team attracted thousands of fans, even more than the match between South China and Lincoln last week. The players of South China who took the field were the same as those who fought the once-dominant Lincoln team last week, but they lost to the weak Artillery team, which had only two wins and nine losses since the start of the season. Was South China defeated because of underestimating the enemy or because of fate, or was the Artillery team's firepower so strong? The reporter dares not judge. Looking back at the recent history of football battles, it feels much different from the previous week. The South China team, which seemed the most promising, and the Lincoln team, which was firmly in first place, have now been defeated and dropped to third place, making it difficult to even get second place.</p>
<p>The teams with the best chance of winning the championship are now St. Joseph's and Wales, who have both lost four points and are standing in first place, overlooking everything. St. Joseph's lost two points to South China, one point to the police, and one point to Lancashire, drawing 2-2 in each case.</p>
<p>The British Navy is in second place, having played a total of twelve matches and lost six points. Four points were lost to St. Joseph's, once 2-1 and once 2-0. The remaining two points were lost to South China (2-2) and Lincoln (2-1).</p>
<p>South China and Lincoln are both in third place, having lost seven points. South China lost two points to Lincoln, two points to the Hong Kong Association, two points to the Artillery team last week, and one point to the British Navy. Lincoln lost two points to South China, two points to St. Joseph's, two points to Wales, and one point to the British Navy.</p>
<p>Although the current standings are like this, it is impossible to say whether there will be any changes. Who wouldn't have said that South China would win against the Artillery team, but who knew that they would lose 2-1? The fact that the weak defeated the strong is not just a one-off event.</p>
<p>Although St. Joseph's and Wales are currently at the top, there are still many strong opponents to face, and the road ahead is full of thorns. St. Joseph's still has to play against South China, Lincoln, Wales, Chinese, and the Hong Kong Association. Wales has two more matches against the Navy than Joseph, and they are all difficult teams to deal with. It is impossible to say whether they will have smooth sailing and continue to advance without failing again. If they fail, it will be different again.</p>
<p>Although South China is now in third place, their chances of winning the championship or runner-up are slim, but hope cannot be said to be lost. If they can avoid defeat in the future, they can still secure the runner-up spot even if they don't win the championship, because St. Joseph's and Wales are bound to lose one match against each other, or at least draw and each lose one point. If South China loses again, they will lose another two points, so they will not get the championship but they will get the runner-up. The Navy's situation is also the same, but the campaign is not over, and there will still be major changes in the future. What will happen in the future? Let's wait and see. This is just a review of the current standings.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Evolution of Land Ownership in China <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>Our country has long emphasized agriculture, a practice unmatched or predating other nations. Eight or nine out of ten common people are engaged in farming, a tradition that has endured for thousands of years, highlighting the importance of agriculture in our nation. In the past, with a sparse population and limited foreign trade, good governance could guide the people to self-sufficiency. However, since modern times, we have suffered from foreign invasions, internal strife, natural disasters, and oppressive governance. Furthermore, the stagnation of agricultural practices has hindered innovation, leading to the collapse of the self-sufficient rural economy. Those who speak of reform advocate for political reform or the development of industry and commerce. Despite the clamor of opinions, little progress has been made. Although human failings may be a factor, the error lies in the focus. Agriculture is the foundation of the nation. Today's social problems, while increasingly complex due to industrial and commercial development, are intertwined with agricultural issues, and the agricultural problem centers around the tenant farming system. Why? Since the abolition of the well-field system in the Qin dynasty, a private tenant system emerged. [Land is not owned by the tiller; some have land but do not till... One person owns the land, while ten till it. Thus, landowners accumulate wealth and become powerful daily, while tillers subsist on meager portions and become impoverished and destitute.] (Su He). This is why society is in constant turmoil without a day of stability. Therefore, the extent of land concentration must be investigated. This article aims to outline the distribution of land ownership and the reasons for its variations.</p>
<p>(1) The Current State of Land Ownership Distribution in China</p>
<p>The distribution of land ownership refers to the allocation of land rights among farmers. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's statistics from 1919 (tables omitted), the total number of farm households in the country was 29,548,529, of which self-cultivating farmers accounted for 58.7%, tenant farmers 22.9%, and semi-self-cultivating farmers 18.4%. The highest tenant farmer rates were in Fujian and Zhejiang, reaching 34.3%, Anhui 32.3%, and Jiangsu 30.3%. The lowest rate was in Chahar at 9.6%. Other provinces, such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, also had very low rates. Professor Buck of our school conducted a survey of land ownership among 2,866 farm households in seventeen locations across seven provinces in 1921. In North China's Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and northern Anhui provinces, self-cultivating farmers averaged 76.5%, semi-self-cultivating farmers 13.4%, and tenant farmers 10.1%. The highest tenant farmer rate was only in Wutai, Shanxi, reaching 60.2%, followed by Su County in Anhui at 20%. The remaining areas were all below 5%, while Yanshan in Hebei and Kaifeng in Henan had no tenant farmers. In contrast, the average for self-cultivating farmers in central and eastern Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian was 48.2%, semi-self-cultivating farmers 21.3%, and tenant farmers 30.5%. In Zhenhai, Zhejiang, the tenant farmer rate was as high as 76.1%, Lai'an in Anhui 50.5%, and Jiangning Taipingmen in Jiangsu 48.4%. The remaining areas, such as Wuhu, Lianjiang, and Wujin, were all around 13%. In total, the tenant farmer rate in the south was more than three times higher than in the north. Furthermore, according to statistics from the Ministry of Industry, the distribution of land rights is as follows:</p>
<p>North China　　　Manchuria　　　Central China　　　South China</p>
<p>Self-cultivating farmers　65.4　　　47.3　　　40.40　　　33.8</p>
<p>Tenant farmers　18.0　　　28　　　35.39</p>
<p>In 1927, Tan Pingshan also published a study on the proportion of agricultural population classes, and his conclusions were generally similar to the previous ones. There are also several sources of data for surveys of provinces, cities, and counties, which may be more accurate.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province | According to the Jiangsu Agricultural Survey Records (published for the Jinling, Suchang, Shanghai, Hai, Huaiyang four circuits), landlords account for 37.3%, semi-landlords 27.6%, and tenant farmers 36.1%. The tenant farmer percentage recorded in the Industrial Journal is smaller, at 29%. Qiao Qiming also investigated the situation in Kunshan, Nantong, and Su County. Tenant farmers account for 77.6% in Kunshan, but only 25.5% in Su County.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province | According to a survey of 85 villages in 20 counties in western Zhejiang, self-cultivating households account for 32.9%, tenant farmer households 36.7%, and semi-self-cultivating households 30.4%. The tenant farmer rate is slightly higher than in Jiangsu, which is consistent with the statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.</p>
<p>Yangqu County, Shanxi Province | A survey of twenty rural villages in Yangqu County by the Shanxi Rural Education Improvement Society found that self-cultivating farmers accounted for 60% to 80% of the population in most areas, with Yulinping reaching 93.5%. The highest tenant farmer rate was in Heitugang at 30.3%, and the lowest was less than 1%, proving that many people own land and farm it themselves.</p>
<p>Yunnan and Guizhou | Due to the sparse population, the tenant farmer rate is lower than in the southeast. According to the Economic Survey Report of the Hunan-Yunnan Railway Yunnan-Guizhou Section by the Ministry of Railways in 1932, there were a total of 463,750 farm households in the section, with self-cultivating farmers accounting for 40%, semi-self-cultivating farmers 30%, and tenant farmers 20%.</p>
<p>Overall, these statistics indicate that the distribution of tenant farmer percentages in our country is not consistent. It varies from province to province, county to county, North China differs from South China, and the Northeast is different from within the passes. Zhang Xinyi has made the following comparison: |</p>
<p>Northeast Region　　Yellow River Basin　　Yangtze River Basin</p>
<p>and its Northern Region　　and its Southern Region</p>
<p>Self-cultivating farmers　　51%　　　69　　　32</p>
<p>Semi-self-cultivating farmers　19　　　18　　CardArray</p>
<p>Tenant farmers　　　30　　　13　　　40</p>
<p>In short, the tenant farmer rate is highest in the southeast, lowest in the Yellow River Basin, and intermediate in the Northeast.</p>
<p>(2) Reasons for Differences in Tenant Farmer Rates in Different Regions</p>
<p>(1) Economic Reasons:</p>
<p>(A) Level of Land Price | The higher the land price, the lower the ability of poor farmers to purchase land, and the land falls into the hands of the rich, and the number of tenant farmers increases. According to statistics from the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the country is divided into seven regions, with the two provinces in the Southeast region having the highest land prices. The highest price for paddy fields in Guangdong reaches 250.5 yuan per mu, and Fujian is also as high as 200 yuan. Next is the Southwest region, with Sichuan paddy fields at 225 yuan per mu, Guizhou 200 yuan, and Yunnan 140 yuan. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is 140 to 150 yuan per mu. Among the Yellow River Basin, the highest is Shandong at 170 yuan, Hebei 150 yuan, and Shaanxi is generally worth about 30 yuan per mu. In the Northeast provinces, only Liaoning is relatively high, with high-quality paddy fields around 100 yuan per mu, while ordinary fields in Heilongjiang and Jilin are only about 10 yuan per mu, with some as low as less than 1 yuan. The price of dry land is also high in the Southeast region, which is why its tenant farmer rate is higher.</p>
<p>(B) Degree of Industrial and Commercial Development | In regions with developed industry and commerce, the demand for agricultural products is high, and farmers often engage in intensive farming to increase their production. However, this type of farming requires sufficient capital. Farmers generally have weak financial resources, and if they purchase land, there will be little left, and working capital (for purchasing fertilizer, farm tools, wages, etc.) will be lacking, resulting in reduced harvests. It is more beneficial to rent land from others and use one's own capital for operating expenses. The coastal areas of southeastern China have highly developed industry and commerce, far surpassing the provinces of North China and the Northeast, so it is reasonable that their tenant farmer rate is higher. The surge in tenant farmers after the Industrial Revolution in England was also due to this.</p>
<p>(C) Relationship to New Lands | Agriculture in our country began in the Henan area. Hong Mai's Rongzhai Essays [In the era of the Zhou dynasty, the land of China was the narrowest... Among them, China was only Jin, Wei, Qi, Lu, Song, and Zheng]. Later, as the population gradually increased, it expanded to the south, seizing land and turning it into virgin land for landlords to invest and develop. Initially, it evolved into a feudal system, which later transformed into a private tenant system. Therefore, the number of tenant farmers in the south increased day by day. Although the northeastern provinces are also virgin land, due to the difficulty of transportation and the severe climate, they are not suitable for planting. The Qing dynasty also prohibited immigration to the Northeast, so the percentage of tenant farmers is not as high as in the south.</p>
<p>(2) Natural Reasons:</p>
<p>(A) Soil Quality | Southern China is suitable for growing rice, and three harvests can be obtained in a year. Northern China is suitable for growing wheat, and the conditions are inferior to those in the south. Moreover, rice eaters account for two-thirds of the country's population, so the demand is high, the price is high, and the profits are also high. Landlords tend to go to the rice-growing areas in the south to get higher rents.</p>
<p>(B) Climate |:</p>
<p>(甲) Temperature | Most of China has a continental climate, especially the northern and northwestern provinces. Temperature changes often tend to be extreme. The temperature in northern January is often below freezing, and the summer is hot. It is not inferior to the south, which hinders the growth of agricultural products. In the Yangtze River and coastal areas, the warm wind arrives from time to time, and Guangdong is like spring all year round, which is very suitable for the development of crops. (乙) Rainfall | There is very little rainfall in the north, and the distribution is not timely. According to the German Hann Gulins Von, the average annual rainfall in the north is about 21 hours, 70% of which falls in June, July, and August, which does not help the growth of crops. The rainfall in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong is sufficient, and the distribution is timely, so landlords tend to gather here.</p>
<p>(C) Disasters | Disasters of floods and droughts are often seen in our country, and their regions are mostly in the north. Floods are mostly caused by the overflow of the Yellow River, and droughts are due to insufficient rainfall. According to the British Consul in China, A. Hosie, between 620 and 1619, China experienced 442 droughts in the north, 352 in the central region, and 252 in the south. The great drought in Shandong in the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign was particularly rare. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, a major drought occurred in the Northwest again. From the perspective of floods, in the past thousand years, there has been a flood in the Yellow River Basin almost every ten years. In the south, from the Tang and Song dynasties to the Qing dynasty, there were only 17 floods in Zhejiang during the Southern Song dynasty. Landlords are also unwilling to invest in disaster-prone areas to reduce their income. (3) Social Reasons</p>
<p>(A) Population Size | In densely populated areas, land is not sufficient for distribution, and the tenant farmer rate will inevitably increase. At present, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces have the highest population densities, each with about 30 million people, while Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces have only about 10 million people. Considering the population density statistics from the Legislative Yuan, Jiangsu has 813 people per square mile, Zhejiang 554, Shanxi 183, Shaanxi 164, and Chahar 12. This is enough to show the reason for the difference in the tenant farmer percentage.</p>
<p>(B) Level of Living Standards | Southern farmers have a better standard of living than northern farmers, and the expenses used for necessities such as food are also greater. According to Buck's survey, the annual consumption of each farm household in North China is 190.36 yuan, while in Central and Eastern China it is 288.63 yuan. If the spending in the south is extravagant and the income is abundant, it can still be maintained. However, in the event of a famine, it is difficult to maintain life, or borrow money to build up debts, so they have to sell their land and become tenant farmers. Twelve, seventeen, Yu Jindai</p>
<h3 id="e230">Roosevelt's Silver Policy and China (Continued) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Qi</p>
<p>2. The Need for Silver</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the need for silver can be divided into three categories: currency use, arts and crafts and industrial use, and storage by Indians and Chinese. Everyone knows that silver is used for art, decorations, and silverware, so there's no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>The main industrial use of silver is in the photographic industry, especially the motion picture film industry. It is said that the motion picture film industry consumes about 60 million ounces of silver per year, of which about 80% of the silver from unused film is chemically reduced. Therefore, the actual consumption is about 12 million ounces per year. The silver consumption for arts and crafts in the past ten years is as follows, most of which was used by the United States.</p>
<p>Silver Consumption for Arts and Crafts and Industrial Use (Unit: Million Ounces)</p>
<p>1921　　51　　1926　　Not Available</p>
<p>1922　　68　　1927　　40</p>
<p>1923　　61　　1928　　61</p>
<p>1924　　58　　1929　　58</p>
<p>1925　　Not Available</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the silver consumption for arts and crafts and industrial use is generally around 50 to 60 million ounces per year, without significant increases or decreases. Therefore, it is clear that this aspect cannot influence the price of silver significantly.</p>
<p>As currency, silver is currently used only in China and a few insignificant colonial countries. Although gold standard countries and de facto gold standard countries also use silver as subsidiary currency, they have been gradually reducing its use recently. The following table lists the annual silver coin minting volume of the two largest silver-using countries, China and India, since 1914:</p>
<p>Silver Coin Minting Volume of China and India (Unit: Thousand Ounces)</p>
<p>Year　　　British India　　　China　　　　　Total World Minting Volume</p>
<p>1914　　18,959　　77,499　　192,501</p>
<p>1915　　5,921　　110,294　　225,116</p>
<p>1916　　75,162　　79,764　　292,148</p>
<p>1917　　95,829　　37,806　　286,596</p>
<p>1918　　148,908　　丨丨　　　　238,992</p>
<p>1919　　152,241　　79,944　　298,300</p>
<p>1920　　37,343　　115,375　　220,218</p>
<p>1921　　4,955　　　35,095　　　155,168</p>
<p>1922　　1,834　　100,928　　　227,210</p>
<p>1923　　2,464　　96,861　　223,998</p>
<p>1924　　985　　　18,028　　　120,421</p>
<p>1928　　769　　　141,343　　216,095</p>
<p>1929　　1,041　　96,751　　　185,433</p>
<p>1930　　627　　　106,479　　206,615</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that India minted 150 million ounces of silver until 1919, but after that, it decreased significantly, minting only 620,000 ounces in 1930. Although China's silver coin minting volume has not increased significantly in recent years, it accounts for more than half of the world's total minting volume. Therefore, China's economic conditions have a significant impact on the price of silver.</p>
<p>Indians and Chinese have a great fondness for silver, so most middle-class families use it as a means of accumulating wealth and storing it. According to Silas, at the end of March 1919, Indian civilians had 3.729 billion ounces. Since then, there have been annual imports, and now there are at least 4.2 billion ounces or more. China's silver holdings are also more than 2.5 billion ounces, of which about 150 million ounces are dead silver. The following table lists the net silver imports of India and China:</p>
<p>Year　　　India　　　China　　　Total</p>
<p>Million Ounces　Million Ounces　Million Ounces</p>
<p>1913　　71　　　61　　　122</p>
<p>1914　　55　　　丨丨　　　55</p>
<p>1915　　33　　　丨丨　　　33</p>
<p>1916　　92　　　丨丨　　　92</p>
<p>1917　　74　　　丨丨　　　74</p>
<p>1918　　180　　　24　　　204</p>
<p>1919　　170　　　53　　　223</p>
<p>1920　　　3　　　92　　　96</p>
<p>1921　　57　　　31　　　88</p>
<p>1922　　73　　　51　　　104</p>
<p>1923　　100　　　50　　　150</p>
<p>1924　　92　　　35　　　128</p>
<p>1925　　101　　　90　　　191</p>
<p>1926　　91　　　73　　　164</p>
<p>1927　　90　　　85　　　175</p>
<p>1928　　89　　　124　　213</p>
<p>1929　　81　　　136　　217</p>
<p>1930　　100　　　126　　226</p>
<p>1931　　59　　　67　　　126</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although the need for silver has gradually decreased after India's currency reform, the public's storage has increased due to the low price of silver.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances of oversupply, insufficient demand, and the deepening of the world economic panic, the sharp drop in silver prices is an inevitable phenomenon and does not need to be explained in too much detail. However, it may be helpful to list another table for reference showing the trajectory of the silver price decline.</p>

<p>3. Roosevelt's Silver Policy and Its Impact</p>
<p>Above, we have briefly reviewed the reasons for the decline in silver prices. Now, let's look at whether Roosevelt's silver policy can raise and stabilize silver prices to increase domestic and foreign trade, and what impact it will have on China.</p>
<p>According to a New York dispatch from the Havas News Agency on December 22 of last year, Congressman Pittman, the proposer of the silver resolution at the World Economic Conference, expressed enthusiastic support for President Roosevelt's decision to mint silver coins. He told the press: "After the United States takes this action, major silver-producing countries such as Canada, Australia, Mexico, and Peru will follow suit and emulate the United States... Roosevelt will stabilize the world silver price to 64.5 cents per ounce, which will increase the purchasing power of the currencies of China, India, Mexico, and South American countries by 60% compared to the US dollar, and will also increase the general purchasing power of the United States by 50%, and will have the same effect as lowering the price of the US dollar." In his proclamation of minting silver coins, President Roosevelt also stated: after his own investigation, he felt that it was necessary to raise and stabilize silver prices in order to raise and stabilize domestic prices, increase the purchasing power of silver-using countries, and protect US foreign trade from the adverse effects of foreign currency depreciation. From the above two quotes, it can be seen that they believe that raising the price of silver to 64.5 cents per ounce will increase the purchasing power of the currencies of China, India, Mexico, and South American countries by 60% compared to the US dollar, to benefit US foreign trade, raise and stabilize domestic prices, and increase the general purchasing power of the United States by 50%, in order to overcome the domestic panic. However, will major silver-producing countries such as Canada, Australia, Mexico, and Peru follow suit as Pittman said, and will the price of silver be permanently stabilized at 64.5 cents per ounce? This is a question worth studying. I think it will probably be like the observation of the London financial community, which said that the US purchase of gold failed to influence world prices, so this US silver policy may have the same experience. When silver-using countries and silver-producing countries announced their silver sales agreement at the World Economic Conference, the price of silver only rose slightly, but then immediately reacted. Therefore, the future situation should be the same. It is estimated that speculators in the United States have about 150 million ounces of silver in stock that they are eager to sell. Although last year's silver production was only 160 million ounces, a decrease of 80 million ounces compared to the average of the past ten years, the world's accumulated silver is still very large. And the opinion of Wall Street in New York is that this new monetary policy may not have a significant effect on raising silver prices immediately; it is estimated that the total inventory of silver bars, excluding those held by the US government, is as high as 105 million ounces. In addition, US silver production accounts for only one-sixth of the world's silver production, and according to the London Silver Agreement, India can sell 35 million ounces of silver on the world market each year, while the total amount of silver held by Indian private individuals is about 75 million ounces, which is not restricted by the agreement. In total, India holds 422.788 million ounces of silver (according to Silas's calculation we cited above, the actual amount is more than this). At the end of 1931, Shanghai's silver reserves reached 190.934 million ounces. Although the London Silver Agreement stipulates that China cannot melt down silver coins, silver ingots widely used in China, with a price of one to five taels, are not subject to restrictions. In recent months, due to expectations that silver prices would rise, as many as 30 million ounces of these silver ingots have been shipped to the United States for sale. From this point of view, the tendency of the US silver price to rise may be stalled by the large-scale influx of foreign silver and the recent intense speculation in silver in the United States. From this, it can be seen that the US government wants to maintain a relatively long-term stable silver price of 64.5 cents unless it prohibits the import of foreign silver. But this would inevitably lose its global effectiveness and would not help in practice. Therefore, to permanently restore silver prices, only a unified restoration of bimetallism by all major countries in the world, and overcoming the current world economic panic, and increasing the use of solutions, can achieve the goal. History has already told us that artificially suppressing or raising prices is only a temporary stimulant and will never be long-lasting.</p>
<p>The London Silver Agreement, which has been approved by India and the United States, seems to have established its foundation. Even if all signatory countries can fully approve and implement it before April 1 of this year, and raise silver prices, that will only be for a period of four years. After four years, once this chain is broken, a large amount of silver will flow out of the national treasuries of various countries into the market, which will undoubtedly create a lower price than the current one.</p>
<p>However, even if we leave aside the matter of four years later for now, and only talk about Roosevelt's silver policy and the London Silver Agreement, assuming that they can raise silver prices, what impact will that have on China? First, we can see that after the price of silver rises, China will inevitably suffer more from the invasion of imported goods from gold standard countries, and at the same time, it will inevitably lead to a sharp decrease in China's exports. Under this situation of a large trade deficit, China, lacking gold to pay for the settlement difference, will inevitably have to export a large amount of silver; as a result, the circulation of domestic banks and paper money in China will inevitably contract, leading to the bankruptcy of banks and stores, and accelerating the rapid collapse of China's rural economy. Secondly, we can see that China's silver reserves will flow out in large quantities due to the stimulation of rising silver prices overseas, causing panic in China's finances. In addition, the government's fiscal revenue will inevitably decrease sharply and be on the verge of crisis due to the reduction in the amount of gold and silver conversion of customs revenue. From this, it can be seen that Roosevelt's silver policy and the London Silver Agreement are nothing more than a policy of US imperialism attempting to transfer the burden of panic to silver-using countries in the East, especially China. Therefore, in the current situation of world economic panic, widespread price declines, and consistent implementation of currency inflation in various countries, we would rather have silver prices fall than artificially raise silver prices like Roosevelt and the London Silver Agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Outline for Reorganizing Land Tax in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>This publication's 48th issue has already mentioned the main points of how Jiangsu Province's land tax should be reorganized. According to reports, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has established a complete and comprehensive plan for the land tax reorganization work in various counties, which will be implemented step by step by county. The plan it has set can be compared with the previous article in this publication, so it is recorded below. It should also be noted by those who are concerned about Jiangsu's finances.</p>
<p>(1) Investigation and Compilation of Land Tax Registers: The biggest cause of the land tax problem is the lack of land tax maps and registers, and the lack of a basis for collecting land tax. Since the loss of the Fish Scale Registers, the collection officials in various counties have no actual collection registers to rely on for each household, and can only rely on the existing books to collect from each household, relying on the clerks. The root cause of all the malpractices in the land tax lies in this. Therefore, the first problem to be solved is how to obtain complete land tax maps and registers, and how to obtain the names of the business households in the flower household registers. Of course, the fundamental solution to this point is to implement land survey. After the land survey, complete maps and registers can be obtained, and various problems can be solved easily. However, land survey takes a long time and is very expensive, and it is definitely not something that can be done in the short term. Before the land survey is carried out, the method of investigating and compiling land tax maps and registers is to first carry out land reporting in the areas of each county where the land survey has not been carried out and the registers have been lost, or to strictly implement universal promotion and collection, which will be handled by the district, township, and town chiefs together with the bookkeepers, and the original grain registers will be collected and cross-checked with each other to compile household and lot registers as the basis for the current grain collection.</p>
<p>(2) Reorganization of Land Tax Surcharges: Everyone knows the complexity of land tax surcharges in Jiangsu Province. The pain that people feel from land tax is also the most severe due to surcharges. Various counties arbitrarily impose surcharges, with complex names and different purposes. Statistics show that there are as many as 105 types of surcharges in the province, and the surcharges exceed the regular tax by more than ten times. Although some of them have regular taxes that are too low, which makes the surcharges particularly high, the fact that they are complex and complicated is undeniable. People do not suffer from the regular tax, but from the surcharges. If the surcharges cannot be paid, even the regular tax cannot be paid, which has a significant impact on the province's revenue. Therefore, the most urgent thing to do in the reorganization of land tax is to reorganize the surcharges in various counties. There are about four methods for reorganizing surcharges: (1) Unify the names. The various surcharge names in various counties should be classified and merged according to their nature, and the percentage distribution ratio should be set separately. Only two names should be on the string vote: provincial tax and county tax. (2) Review the uses. A local budget review committee will be set up by the department group, and the county magistrate of each county will be convened to thoroughly review the additional uses. (3) Reduce the tax rate. This will be done at the same time as the review of uses. The surcharge rates in various counties that are too high will be strictly reduced to reduce the burden on the people. In the future, various counties will be strictly prohibited from arbitrarily increasing surcharges and taxes. The above items are already in active progress, and it is said that the reorganization will be completed in three months.</p>
<p>(3) Improve the Collection System: Improving the collection system and implementing strict auditing are essential for improving the land tax. If people can understand the tax payment procedures, they will not be deceived by the clerks. If the authorities can audit the collection, the clerks will not embezzle the tax funds. If the treasury system can be strictly implemented, the tax funds can be deposited into the treasury on time. It is said that the urgent things to do in reorganizing the land tax in various counties include: ordering various counties to announce the land tax laws, abolishing silver and rice, changing to collecting national currency, improving the land tax payment procedures, reforming the string vote, and strictly implementing legislation for business households to directly pay grain.</p>
<p>It is said that the above reorganization steps are all for the counties in the first phase of the initial reorganization period. The counties that are already surveying the land will proceed with the second phase of the reorganization measures. However, it is said that the second phase plan is closely related to the land bureau in terms of implementing land surveys, conducting registration, and estimating land prices in various counties. The Department of Finance and the Provincial Land Bureau will cooperate to take close contact steps.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Finance: Foreign Exchange Reduced to Two Points <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, because it was Sunday and the banks were closed, there was no delivery of money as usual. The foreign exchange market price in the market was two points in both the morning and afternoon markets, a sudden decrease of three points compared to the previous day. The reason was that the transaction of exchange bills decreased sharply, and the market was very loose. It is estimated that the turnover in the morning market was more than 3.4 million, new transactions were more than 300,000, transactions in the afternoon market were more than 400,000, transactions in the Small General Association were more than 300,000, the remittance of foreign public bills by money houses was more than 28 million, and there was no delivery of foreign exchange. The amount owed by various routes was more than 300,000. The market price of subsidiary currency: the price of Jiangnan small foreign coins was 845 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were made, with 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of Guangdong small foreign coins was 791 yuan in the morning market and 791 yuan and 6 jiao in the afternoon market. Transactions were 40,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins was reduced by 1,000 wen to 294,000. Transactions were 33,810 strings, with a total value of 11,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Resulting in Gains Ranging from Several Cents to $1.35</p>
<p>From January 15th to 20th last week, the market prices at the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated dramatically. Since the Fujian Incident, after the recovery of Fuzhou, it seemed things might settle down. However, the 19th Route Army, like a cornered beast, continued to fight, and the Southwest mobilized again, sending large forces into Fujian, creating the impression of "playing the lute and singing." Although the conflict between Sun and Ma was a local issue, the possibility of escalation meant the central government couldn't ignore it. The Fourth Plenary Session had already convened, but the potential for hidden reefs ahead caused concern. With only a few days left for the Exchange's January futures contracts and approximately 80 million in margin accounts, the market, after a brief period of stability, experienced significant turbulence again within a day or two. Today marks the start of the final four days of trading for this month's futures, coinciding with the Fourth Plenary Session, suggesting further volatility in price fluctuations. On Monday, with the recovery of Fuzhou, market prices rose only slightly at the opening, with only the top stocks gaining a few cents. The rest generally weakened, resulting in an overall decline of about half a yuan, due to the general belief that the final hope had been realized, leading to a rush to sell. This unexpected trend created doubt, and steadfast investors were unwilling to blindly follow, leading to a stalemate on Tuesday and Wednesday, with prices fluctuating minimally. On Thursday, the short sellers' positions showed signs of weakening, and suddenly, a large amount of funds were spent on No. 46, but the market price only increased by 3-5 cents. On Friday, despite the pressure from No. 46's selling, the eagerness to cover short positions far exceeded it, and various bonds reached new highs. Troop Reorganization Bonds broke through 66 yuan, and Salt Tax Bonds surged past the 50 yuan mark. The rapid gains resulted in a sudden increase of over one yuan throughout the day. On Saturday, a frenzy of selling from No. 4, even more intense than No. 46, made it difficult for the market to sustain gains, showing slight signs of fatigue. Over the week, although the price fluctuations were significant, they were not the most extreme, mainly due to speculation about the success of the upcoming Fourth Plenary Session, causing some turbulence. Once the resolutions are announced, there will likely be even larger waves, especially considering the final three to four days of the month. The market ultimately saw gains ranging from several cents to $1.35, with a total transaction volume of 94,639,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market initially rose due to buying by industry peers, but later fell back due to profit-taking by longs and reactive selling. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 8 to 12 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering, resulting in gains of 1 rupee for Pingar, 2 rupees for Omra, and 1 rupee and 2.5 annas for White Broach.

<p>(South Shanghai) Supplies from various sources remain scarce, totaling only about 30 vessels (4,000-5,000 piculs). Among them, only about ten vessels of late rice have arrived. Buyers are actively seeking supplies, with the North China Tianjin group and the South China Xiamen group continuing to purchase. The market remains tight, with both groups purchasing a total of 1,200-1,300 bags of Qingjiao, Sisong, and other varieties, pushing prices up by 3 cents. As for the various types of thick粳rice and Doyang pointed rice, local stores are selling well, and the market has stabilized. Prices remain unchanged. Yinyuan rice, however, is showing weakness due to the sudden withdrawal of purchases by the liquor merchants. Bianyuan rice, on the other hand, is selling well in small quantities due to seasonal factors, so its price is standing out.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 145-146 vessels arrived from various locations along the river. Due to the river blockage of the previous days, which lasted for four or five days, a total of over 100 vessels arrived over the past few days. Sales were moderate, but transactions were slow. The market price of white粳rice was down a few cents. The demand for various grades of Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice was strong, and prices were stable. Du Yangbu, Jian, and early thin rice were generally stable.</p>

<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>(Continued from Issue 54)</p>
<p>㈢ Equipment Issues</p>
<p>When it comes to equipment, naturally, universities and specialized schools should have adequate facilities. As the old saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." No one can oppose this principle. However, in our impoverished country, those in charge of education must lower the standard for equipment. We must understand that the purpose of our equipment is for teaching and research, so the standard of equipment should be sufficient for teaching and research. To put it extremely, for example, if one wants to culture bacteria, if the school is poor and cannot afford many good incubators, using thermos bottles as a substitute is not necessarily impossible. For example, if one wants to preserve the current state of bacteria and prevent them from developing, if the school is poor and cannot afford many good refrigerators, using a few wooden boxes filled with sawdust and wood shavings, and then adding some ice, can also serve as a substitute for a refrigerator, and it will have a considerable effect in curbing the development of bacteria. It is not necessarily impossible to succeed. This kind of "poverty-stricken" research work should have considerable value in our impoverished country. I will give it a badge and call it "austere research," which happens to imitate health work and is the opposite of the "austere hygiene" that I mentioned above. Therefore, I believe that for the equipment issue in medical schools, we should only require that it be sufficient for teaching and research. If there is no money to buy many good incubators for culturing bacteria, then thermos bottles will do. If there is no money to buy many good refrigerators for curbing bacterial growth, then wooden boxes will do. As for the instruments that are absolutely indispensable and cannot be replaced, of course, they must be prepared. If we develop our country's medical education and medical research with this kind of advocacy, this kind of mentality, and this kind of plan, then our impoverished country will have hope. If we violate this idea, forget the economic situation of the entire country, forget that we were born as ordinary people in an impoverished country, act confused and filthy, flatter and smile obsequiously, and start swaggering around as soon as we get a little money, looking down on rickshaws while riding in cars, dismissing those who ride in small carts as if they were not human, and treating charcoal braziers as worthless after using hot water heaters, then not only is one's mind, insight, and capacity not worthy of emulation, but, to put it bluntly, one does not want medical education in our impoverished country to develop. People who hold this view must either have other motives or have a slight mental disorder. If it is solely for the sake of teaching, so that students can broaden their horizons and knowledge, and avoid being treated as if they came from a small family, then there are even better ways. Just buy several sample books and explain the diagrams to the students in detail, and that will be enough. If not, take them to see and learn from different places. As for where they will work after graduation, the scope of work will definitely be limited. The instruments and techniques used in this limited scope can be learned temporarily, in a few hours at the very least, and in two or three days at the most. This is not a major obstacle to a medical career. People who will only read in a bright and clean room and only practice writing with fine pens and beautiful paper are definitely not good students. They are only cultivating extravagant habits and are prone to disappointment and discouragement when they enter impoverished society! However, although I make this argument, I still advocate that schools should do research if they have the opportunity, but they should not dismiss and reject those who cannot afford to do research. Furthermore, they should not forget to support them and help them improve.</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>丨Jiao Yitang's Resignation丨</p>
<p>Last week, various newspapers published a Nanjing dispatch, which roughly stated: "On the 12th, at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan, members Jiao Yitang and Peng Yangguang, because the National Medical Center Regulations they proposed were opposed, left in anger before the meeting ended and immediately submitted their resignations." Another message said: "In the National Medical Center Regulations proposed by Jiao, the director was to be appointed by simplified procedure, and the section chiefs were to be appointed by commission, which resembled the organization of a government office. Some people opposed the establishment of another redundant agency, and Chairman Sun Ke put it to a vote. As a result, it was rejected by a vote of 42 to 10. Jiao then left the meeting hall with his briefcase and immediately drafted a letter of resignation with Peng Yangguang." Later, the newspapers reported: "After Chairman Sun's retention of Jiao and Peng, and the promise to resubmit the National Medical Center Regulations for review, the intention to resign has been withdrawn."</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, it is already sufficient to vividly depict Jiao Yitang's thoughts, insights, character, and learning. His act of resigning and withdrawing his resignation is just like a tantrum. Moreover, he, who also serves as the director of the National Medical Center, must obtain a simplified procedure appointment.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan is one of the five branches of the government, and one-fifth of the national affairs relies on this meeting to resolve them. It is not a place to exclusively discuss national medicine. Because one case did not meet his private intentions, Jiao left the meeting hall with his briefcase. Where does he intend to place his remaining responsibilities? Where does he intend to place national affairs? In a meeting, if the minority does not obey the majority and can arbitrarily walk out of the meeting hall, I am afraid that all the committee members of various meetings can run away completely. What else can be discussed? If the country's legislation is handed over to people like this, isn't it terrible!</p>
<p>The world's medicine is already tending towards unity. Should the Chinese medical community use the term "national medicine" to confront Western medicine, sensible people have already said so. Recently, Mr. Wang Jingwei's remarks were very good: "Since medicine is to be divided into national medicine and Western medicine, then should the military also be divided into the national army that uses broadswords and the Western army that uses machine guns! Therefore, there is only a distinction between scientific medicine and non-scientific medicine, and there should be no separate category of 'national medicine'!" This statement is extremely thorough and has won the sympathy of the majority of people. The rejection of the National Medical Center Regulations by the members of the Legislative Yuan this time may be due to Mr. Wang's insightful remark. That is why Jiao was so anxious.</p>
<p>Jiao Yitang is so loyal to the National Medical Center. In the end, I don't know what medicine he is selling in his gourd. Some people say that he has other political purposes. Some people say that he is foolishly loyal and does not understand the general trend. However, even according to the tone of his letter to the people, saying something about preserving national essence and resisting foreign goods is just as pleasant to hear as the Boxers' "Support the Qing and destroy the foreign." Unfortunately, today's national affairs must go through the system of meetings. Otherwise, Jiao could just like Duanhua and Sushun in those years, deceive the Empress Dowager Cixi alone and do a thorough job of the National Medical Center.</p>
<p>Jiao's tantrum has already taken effect and has already gained the face of being retained. In fact, it is not considered to be loyal to the country. It would be best to have another "corpse remonstrance" and simply leave a suicide note to the President of the Legislative Yuan and other members. It is expected that the National Medical Center Regulations will be safely implemented, and it will save the trouble of roundabout maneuvers to submit them for review. Fortunately, the Boxers wanted to kill foreigners, so the Eight-Nation Alliance came to resolve the situation, and Duan and Su were convicted. National medicine does not harm foreigners in the slightest, so of course, no foreigners will interfere. I guarantee that not only will he not be executed, but he may also receive incense and flower offerings and become a living Buddha of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e238">After Saying Goodbye to Western Suits <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Because my giving up Western suits for Chinese attire has attracted a lot of attention, although my article "Farewell to Western Suits" was partly playful in nature, it can be said to be a kind of personal awakening and a promotion to my friends and relatives. People like Chun Yukun and Zhuang Zhou often combined satire with humor, and my article, at the very least, cannot be said to be without purpose!</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since I changed to Chinese attire! In this short period of time, it is certainly impossible to talk about any achievements, but I have already received its benefits in terms of hygiene! For more than ten years of wearing Western suits, I often suffered from colds every winter. Although it was not like most people's runny noses and coughs, even this minor cold always felt uncomfortable. Since abandoning Western suits and changing to Chinese attire, although the time has been very short, the problem of winter colds has also left me with Western suits. As for the warmth and comfort of the body, it really gives me a good impression! On the streets where the north wind is whistling, it does not seem to feel too uncomfortable. And the friends who generally wear tight sleeves and hard shirts and think they are beautiful, their shrinking appearance, as I see it, there is a sense of "that time is different from this time"!</p>
<p>My personal experience of changing to Chinese clothing is like this, as for my students? In the past, Western suits accounted for 70-80% of them. After I changed to Chinese clothing, after my repeated persuasion, most of them have already changed to Chinese clothing! They used to suffer from winter colds like me, but now? They have also said goodbye to this hateful cold like me. From a hygienic point of view, Chinese clothing cannot be said to be without any benefits!</p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that my two goals in saying goodbye to Western suits, namely, promoting hygiene and recovering rights, have at least achieved the first goal! The second one is difficult to say, because my personal strength and the strength of many students in my school are very small, and it seems that it will not help. This is to hope that patriotic compatriots will give it a promotion! The things in the world are related to each other, and the benefits of Chinese clothing are as described above, but is there no inconvenience? This is not the case. Chinese clothing also has its own troubles. This trouble is not the trouble of Chinese clothing itself, but the trouble caused by wearing Chinese clothing.</p>
<p>Chinese people have a special psychology of "fear of foreigners" and "worship of foreigners." Not only are they afraid of and worship true foreigners, but also Chinese products that imitate foreigners. For this reason, friends who wear Western suits are always more advantageous than those who wear Chinese clothing, especially when traveling. Once you arrive at the station, you can tell the difference! When I used to wear Western suits, I was never checked by the police at the station. Now that my clothes have changed, the attitude of the police at the station has also changed! Strict interrogation and meticulous inspection, as if not afraid of trouble, in fact, my clothes are not gorgeous, but they are also neat. Where do they know that they are wearing colored glasses? Therefore, I feel "that time is different from this time" again!</p>
<p>The psychology of the Chinese people is like this, and the psychology of the Chinese people wearing Western suits is also like this. Unfortunately, Chinese clothing cannot be blamed on it!</p>

<p>(Lecture Manuscript from the Tzu Hang Midwifery School and Asia Middle School) Jiang Benyi</p>
<p>Intestinal parasitic diseases are caused by the parasitism of intestinal parasites. Since there are so many types of intestinal parasites, there are also so many types of intestinal parasitic diseases. Writing them out one by one would be both too troublesome and unnecessary. Therefore, only a few commonly seen intestinal parasitic diseases will be written about here; and for each disease, only a few very simple outlines will be given. Readers</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>who are looking for advanced materials here will surely be disappointed. Fortunately, this is popular medical and hygiene common sense, as long as simple things can be explained, so that the general reader can gain some knowledge of human intestinal parasitic diseases.</p>
<p>Now, let me write down some of the most common intestinal parasitic diseases that we often see:</p>
<p>(A) Ascariasis</p>
<p>Ascariasis is very common in our China, probably accounting for 50% to 70%. To put it clearly, 50 to 70 out of 100 people have ascariasis.</p>
<p>Ascaris is a roundworm that lives in our small intestine. The male worm is about 250 mm long and 4 mm in diameter; the female worm is 400 mm long and 6 mm in diameter. When this worm is parasitizing, we will develop many disease symptoms. The most obvious are:</p>
<p>1.  Pica</p>
<p>People with ascariasis! Especially children, often have different tastes from ordinary people, and like to eat wall soil, courtyard soil, chalk, incense sticks, and other things that ordinary people never eat.</p>
<p>2.  Gastrointestinal Symptoms</p>
<p>Increased or decreased appetite, vomiting, belching, bad breath, bloating, abdominal pain, malnutrition, etc.</p>
<p>3.  Toxic Symptoms</p>
<p>Toxic symptoms are most common in children. For example, suddenly developing a high fever and symptoms like meningitis, dizziness, convulsions, epilepsy, nerve pain, itchy nose, hearing and vision impairment, memory loss, etc.</p>
<p>4.  Intestinal Perforation</p>
<p>If there are ulcers in the intestines, ascaris worms often perforate the intestinal wall and burrow out of it, thus becoming acute peritonitis and dying. However, this example is relatively rare.</p>
<p>5.  Intestinal Obstruction</p>
<p>If a large number of ascaris worms gather in the intestine and cannot easily get out, it can often cause ascariasis obstruction and death. However, this example is also rare.</p>
<p>6.  Other</p>
<p>Ascaris worms have a habit of burrowing into small holes, so sometimes they often burrow into our trachea, nasal cavity, lacrimal duct, and bile duct, causing various dangerous symptoms.</p>
<p>Ascariasis is one of the most common but not very dangerous intestinal parasitic diseases, but it already has such severe symptoms. Needless to say about others, is it necessary to remove human intestinal parasites? I think if you are not stupid, you will definitely say [yes]. Now let’s talk about other types of intestinal parasitic diseases.</p>
<p>(B) Duodenal Worm Disease</p>
<p>Duodenal worm is a small roundworm that lives in the duodenum. It is much smaller than ascaris worms. The female worm has a long diameter of 12 to 18 millimeters; the male worm has a long diameter of 6 to 10 millimeters. The color of the worm is either yellowish-white or reddish.</p>
<p>The most important symptom of duodenal worm disease is anemia. Therefore, people with duodenal worm disease, in addition to having symptoms similar to those of ascariasis, the most prominent symptom is anemia. As the disease progresses, the skin and mucous membranes gradually become pale. Due to anemia, the nails lack nutrition and become thin and easily broken. Wavy bumps appear on its surface. Heart palpitations, difficulty breathing. As the disease progresses further, there is a tendency to develop edema and bleeding. Not only that, but also various lesions occur in the nervous system. The most obvious ones are headaches, tinnitus, dizziness, insomnia, dreaminess, neurasthenia, cerebral anemia, epileptic seizures, and poor memory. In addition, development is also greatly affected. For example, if a child gets this disease, their mental development will be slow and their physical development will be poor. If a woman gets this disease, she will often experience amenorrhea and miscarriage.</p>
<p>(C) Enterobiasis</p>
<p>Pinworm is an intestinal parasite even smaller than duodenal worms. The male worm is 2 mm to 4 mm long, and the female worm is 12 mm long.</p>
<p>Although enterobiasis is much less dangerous than ascariasis and duodenal worm disease, it is very annoying when parasitized by it. Its most prominent symptom is anal itching, especially when falling asleep at night, because the buttocks are warm, and pinworms crawl out of the intestines to lay eggs on the skin around the anus and perineum, which not only makes the patient feel itchy and uncomfortable, but also unconsciously develops bad habits such as masturbation.</p>
<p>The symptoms of enterobiasis are mostly local symptoms. For example: balanitis, penile erection and semen leakage, prostatitis, vulvovaginitis, leucorrhea, chronic proctitis, etc. caused by local irritation of pinworms.</p>
<p>(D) Trichuriasis</p>
<p>Trichuriasis is also a very popular disease, probably accounting for 60% to 70%. To put it clearly, worm eggs of whipworms can be found in the feces of 60 to 70 out of 100 people.</p>
<p>The whipworm is just as its name suggests, like a whip. The front body is as thin as a thread, and the rear body is relatively thick, like the handle of a whip. Its long diameter is about 40 to 50 millimeters.</p>
<p>Trichuriasis has no inherent symptoms, but when a large number of them are parasitizing, it can often cause stubborn diarrhea, even mucoid bloody stools, thus leading to anemia, high fever, and various neurological symptoms, eventually leading to death.</p>
<p>If whipworms parasitize in the cecum or appendix, they often cause cecitis or appendicitis.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(24) Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Continued)</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) During the progressive stage, the fever continues to rise, the body weight gradually decreases, the lesions in the lungs expand, the cheeks are flushed, there is a kind of luster in the eyes, the complexion is pale, there is stinging pain in the chest, the anterior spine increases, a large amount of sputum is coughed up, and the sputum contains mucus or pus-like substances, the cough is severe, and repeated hemoptysis occurs, and cavities form in the lungs.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any unique features in the patient’s appearance?</p>
<p>(A) Patients have a consumptive physique, the slope of the ribs is steep, the collarbone is prominent, the shoulder blades are winged, the chest wall is sunken due to lung atrophy, the spine is slightly forward-curved, and they are emaciated (because fat disappears and muscles atrophy). The range of heartbeats expands and rises.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the patient’s fever like?</p>
<p>(A) Fever is one of the most important symptoms of consumptive patients. And patients pay very much attention to fever. Generally, it is between 37 and 38 degrees Celsius, decreasing in the morning and rising about 0.5 degrees in the evening. As the disease progresses, it rises to 39 or 40 degrees in the evening. This kind of fever is called consumption fever, which hurts the body the most.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the reason for the fever in tuberculosis patients?</p>
<p>(A) It is probably due to the toxic reaction of tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>(Q) What other important symptoms do tuberculosis patients have besides fever?</p>
<p>(A) There is also the symptom of night sweats after sleeping.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the patient’s cough like?</p>
<p>(A) The cough of consumptive patients is mainly dry cough and slight cough, and the cough is more severe in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the condition of the sputum?</p>
<p>(A) When there are cavities in the lungs, the amount of sputum increases; the sputum coughed up is mucopurulent and not very thick. The sputum discharged from the cavities is often lumpy and contains a lot of blood.</p>
<p>(Q) Can people who have already suffered from consumptive disease be immune?</p>
<p>(A) The primary lung lesions have a greater tendency to heal; most of them stop with some traces of changes in the bronchial glands. When such a state recurs later and new lesions occur, it becomes a chronic and mild process. In short, at the time of the initial onset, the patient has gained some comparative immunity, so it can be so mild when it recurs.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the prevention methods for pulmonary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) First, it is isolation: People suffering from open pulmonary tuberculosis should be isolated to avoid spreading the infection to others, because their sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria. Infants are most likely to get sick, and they are also more dangerous; therefore, strict isolation is necessary. Second, it is most important for patients not to cough in the face of people and to cover their mouths with a cloth. Third, the sputum must be spat in a sputum cup. Put a little disinfectant in it, such as carbolic acid water, Lysol water, limewater, etc. Fourth, clothes should be steam-sterilized and sun-sterilized. Fifth, houses and sick rooms should have sufficient sunlight and ventilation. Do not use brooms when sweeping to avoid dust flying around. Sixth, marriage has the risk of mutual infection between husband and wife. Pregnancy and childbirth are both dangerous, so attention should be paid to them. Seventh, nutrition should be fully supplied, and colds should be prevented.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Implementation of Pulmonary Disease Prevention <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The earlier a disease is discovered, the greater the hope of curing it. Everyone knows this. There is a saying that the best doctor treats the disease before it occurs. Therefore, the highest peak of medicine in our ideal belongs to the work of preventing diseases. It is too late to apply treatment after the disease occurs.</p>
<p>However, in clinical experiments, there are many diseases that have very little pain at the beginning. You must wait until the disease increases before you feel pain and seek medical treatment, such as heart, kidney, cancer, and syphilis. Pulmonary disease (pulmonary tuberculosis) is especially the case. In my annual observation of patients with pulmonary disease who come to the hospital for treatment, most of them have lost [the opportunity for proper treatment], so they are urgently seeking treatment when the disease is escalating. Most of the physical strength of this type of patient is too weak, so the treatment is extremely difficult. If they can be treated at the beginning, it will be twice the result with half the effort. The superiority of the treatment results can be asserted. However, given the immaturity of knowledge of our people and the lack of common knowledge about diseases, wanting them to be able to get early treatment is tantamount to blaming the blind to see things as equally impossible. Therefore, we can only rely on the efforts of our doctors to conduct examinations when patients think they are healthy in order to achieve the goal of early treatment, which is also the implementation of pulmonary disease prevention.</p>
<p>Pulmonary disease is an infectious disease. If it can be treated early, it can be easily eradicated. It is closely related to public health and social health. However, early examination is very difficult. If only percussion and auscultation are performed, it is really not enough to fully diagnose early pulmonary disease. The most reliable method of early diagnosis is to use X-rays for detailed examination to be able to see the crux of the problem.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Results of X-Ray Examination of People Who Consider Themselves Healthy <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>When we perform X-ray examinations on people who consider themselves healthy, we can often see calcified lesions and pleural adhesions, lung scars, etc. in their lungs. This kind is all non-progressive diseases, accounting for about 6% to 10% of the patients, especially those over 60 years old. However, patients with this kind of non-progressive pulmonary disease, although temporarily cured, often have the risk of recurrence and becoming progressive pulmonary disease.</p>
<p>Secondly, all progressive pulmonary diseases from initial infiltration to extremely severe open diseases can be detected. Most of them are from 15 to 60 or 70 years old. According to the statistics of Dr. Brawing, about 5 to 10 per thousand of the patients suffering from this kind of progressive pulmonary disease are initially considered to have absolutely healthy lungs.</p>
<p>Most people who are healthy in appearance but have pulmonary disease or open pulmonary disease do not know it, because their symptoms are very slight, so it is not easy to attract their attention. However, we must pay attention to these patients with unconscious pulmonary disease, because if they can be discovered early, on the one hand, it can be treated early, and on the other hand, it can be prevented from infection. 、</p>
<p>I once saw Mr. Gu Zheng, a physical educator, who was extremely strong. At first, he did not know that there was any pathological change in his lungs, but during the January 28 Incident, Mr. Gu became ill due to overwork in serving the Security Corps. In addition, a physical education instructor at Guanghua University, a native of Wuxi, also had a physique that was stronger than ordinary people, and had hemoptysis due to strenuous exercise. These lesions can be detected on X-rays. Therefore, if we can carry out strict X-ray examinations on people who usually consider themselves healthy, that is, for unconscious pulmonary disease, the more pulmonary diseases are discovered, the less hidden they will be. In other words, even if the patient has not noticed it himself, his lesions have been seen by us, which is of great importance to both treatment and prevention. This is the excellent result of performing X-ray examinations, and it is also the preliminary step in the implementation of pulmonary disease prevention.</p>
<p>In short, the unconscious period of pulmonary disease lasts for a long time. The necessary method of pulmonary disease prevention in our ideal is to conduct a general X-ray examination for all the people once or twice a year, so that the lesions can be detected and eradicated early when the patient has no pain. However, this move is extremely difficult to implement in practice. It is also not easy to find ways to conduct separate examinations in various groups such as schools, institutions, factories, and troops under the current situation of our country’s health administration. Even if the goal of this general examination can be achieved, it is only a small part of the entire healthy population. In other words, this kind of general X-ray examination, although extremely important, can only detect a part of the patients with unconscious pulmonary disease, and most of the patients with pulmonary disease will be discovered when they seek medical treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Results of X-Ray Examination of Patients <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Hormann’s statistics after examining various patients with X-rays are as follows.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Pulmonary disease, pneumonia. Number of people: 884. After X-ray examination, 295 people were considered to have pulmonary tuberculosis, and 137 of them were open.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Dry pleurisy. Number of people: 113. After X-ray examination, 16 people were considered to have pulmonary tuberculosis, and 5 of them were open. Diagnosis: Asthma, bronchitis, emphysema. Number of people: 165. After X-ray examination, 15 people were considered to have pulmonary tuberculosis, and 5 of them were open.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Influenza, number of people examined within three weeks during the epidemic. Number of people: 163. After X-ray examination, 14 people were considered to have pulmonary tuberculosis, and 5 of them were open. Diagnosis: Influenza, number of people examined within three weeks when not epidemic. Number of people: 73. After X-ray examination, 14 people were considered to have pulmonary tuberculosis, and 6 of them were open. From this, it can be seen that there are many latent pulmonary diseases (pulmonary tuberculosis), and at the same time, there are open pulmonary diseases among them. Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment are as important as early detection of unconscious pulmonary diseases in preventing transmission, and should not be neglected by us. But when the patient first seeks medical treatment, the conscious symptoms are very slight and difficult to distinguish. Even if the patient has a considerable degree of illness, percussion and auscultation are also unreliable. It is really difficult to get an accurate diagnosis without X-ray examination. However, most doctors may not have X-ray equipment, so it is inevitable that they will be delayed. This is not only the case in our country, but also in developed countries in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Because pulmonary disease at the beginning mostly has very slight symptoms, or even no pain, and its symptoms are often similar to other diseases, it is easy to be misidentified.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of implementing prevention, if we cannot detect and eradicate these unconscious and latent pulmonary diseases as early as possible, how can we curb the spread of pulmonary disease? Therefore, preventing pulmonary disease is most effective by early diagnosis and treatment before the disease occurs, and for early diagnosis, there is really no other more reliable method than X-ray examination.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Announcement by Dr. Yu Yunxiu <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>In general, young people are rich in the spirit of research and are brave in reforming. Why is this? Because the idea of ​​profit and loss is not as strong as the heart of right and wrong. Nowadays, medical skills and science are advancing rapidly. Even in terms of the Chinese medicine regulations, there must be provisions for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and disinfection methods. Isn’t it necessary for Chinese medicine to supplement new knowledge? Gu or forced by facts, or regarding self-cultivation, the heart is long and the strength is short, and the situation is restricted, which is also inevitable. Dr. Yu Yunxiu has been studying new and old medicine for many years and knows that there are many Chinese medicine practitioners who are determined to follow him but cannot get what they want. Based on the idea of ​​rescuing the drowning and pointing out the lost, he opened the door of convenient training and learning, and complied with the requirements of all parties to set up a Chinese Medicine Supplementary Education Research Class, publish lectures, and teach new knowledge. Based on science, refer to old theories, consider the depth and add detailed explanations in order to help practice. This is not only to complete the medical field, but also the foundation of the scientification of Chinese medicine. I hope that young aspiring people will not miss it. There are printed brochures. Those who ask for them by mail should attach two points of postage, and they will be sent immediately. The registration date is from now until the end of January. The payment date is from now until the end of February. Yu’s Research Room (Corner of Haining Road North, Shanghai, Shanxi Road)</p>

<h3 id="e245">Random Scolding <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Shuohan</p>
<p>There is also a kind of dissatisfaction with critics, saying that so-called critics like to [randomly scold], so their writing is not criticism.</p>
<p>This [random scolding] is written as [漫駡] by some people, and [謾駡] by others. I don't know if they have the same meaning. But let's put that aside for now. The question now is what is [random scolding]?</p>
<p>If you point at a person and say: This is a prostitute! If she is a respectable woman, then that is random scolding; if she is really making a living by selling laughter, then it is not random scolding, but telling the truth. Poets don't buy official titles, and the rich only know how to calculate, because that's the way things are, so this is the truth. Even if it is called random scolding, the poet still can't buy a title. This is a small nail where fantasy meets reality.</p>
<p>Having money does not necessarily mean having talent, understanding the nature of children is not necessarily clearer than [having a houseful of children]. [Having a houseful of children] can only prove that the couple is good at giving birth and knows how to raise them, but it does not mean that they can talk nonsense about children's rights. To talk about it is just shameless. This seems like random scolding, but it is not. If you say it is, you have to admit that all the child psychologists in the world are the parents who are best at having children.</p>
<p>Saying that children will fight for a little food is wronging children, in fact it is random scolding. Children's behavior comes from nature, and also changes due to the environment, so Kong Rong would let his pear go. Those who fight are influenced by the family. Aren't there also adults who fight for family property and seize inheritance? The children learned the way.</p>
<p>Random scolding has wronged many good people, but vaguely extinguishing [random scolding] protects all bad seeds.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Fragments of Travel <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>If we say that the happiness of travel lies in constantly seeing new scenery and getting new stimuli, then in terms of the border areas of China, traveling in western Yunnan is the most fortunate. Of course, there is one condition that must be added, that is, not to encounter bandits robbing on the road.</p>
<p>The reason why traveling in western Yunnan is so interesting and unforgettable is that the climate in some places will show the different states of two countries in one day's journey, and the life in some places will also mark out two centuries in one day's journey. different phenomena.</p>
<p>I remember that the year I went to Myanmar from Kunming, around the second month of the lunar calendar, when I passed through Lefeng County, I saw broad bean flowers blooming and rape flowers turning green in the fields outside the city in the morning. It was a good time in mid-spring, and the climate was also very mild. After turning over a few mountains, at noon, when I arrived at a place called Xiaowa (surrounded by high mountains, with small valleys in the middle), it was as if I had arrived in another country. The broad bean leaves were already yellow and old, and they were being harvested by farmers. The sun was scorching hot, just like the beginning of May. The trees around were also lush green, without any spring weather at all. When I rested in front of someone's house and asked for water, the dog was too lazy to bark, lying on the wall, panting. People were bare-backed, sleeping on cool mats, enjoying the happiness of a midsummer nap. The sound of flies filled the house, showing the unique scenery of hot weather. In the evening, when I arrived at Shezi, although the fields were gradually covered with the hazy night, the fragrance of spring flowers and the smell of wild grass could still be smelled. It makes people feel as if the spring that disappeared at noon has returned again in the evening.</p>
<p>In Lefeng City at night, every shop has a stinky oil lamp, but on Shezi Street, it is only a day's journey away. Lamps, shops are simply as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Not to mention the use of kerosene lamps, even the use of sesame oil lamps is extremely rare. Well, in this way, it seems that people on Shezi Street close their doors and go to sleep at night, and do no business at all. No, on the contrary, the evening is still lively, and the street is brightly lit. This is because every shop or household nails an iron plate on the wall and puts small strips of pine wood (that is, pine wood containing a large amount of rosin) on it, lighting a small ball of raging fire to illuminate the entire room. Walking on the street, smelling the fragrance of pine smoke and looking at such a strange scene, recalling the mood of ancient times, it lightly rippled in the heart of the traveler.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Live Pig Raft <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiahuai</p>
<p>The raft was untied.</p>
<p>As if slipping away, the raft drifted effortlessly downstream; except for turns or shallow waters where a bamboo pole was needed, it barely required any human effort.</p>
<p>The water was a deep green. Snow fell on it, light as goose feathers touching the ground, unheard. Yet, as it melted, bubbles appeared. If you looked closely, you could see their round shape, like tiny fish spitting froth from the bottom.</p>
<p>On the high mountains on both sides, the snow had piled up thick. It was dazzlingly white, its fresh luster undimmed even by the gloomy sky.</p>
<p>Three live pig rafts were linked together, one after the other, drifting like lines on the deep green water.</p>
<p>The pigs squealed fiercely, threatened by the cold. The pigpens were covered only by a bamboo screen. All sides were open. Except for a few rough fir timbers, there was no barrier. Snow easily drifted onto them. And they had nothing to eat, hungry all day, so they squealed shrilly, constantly gnawing at the fir timbers. "These beasts deserve to die!"</p>
<p>The old raftsman said resentfully, his brow furrowed, as if he had never heard a pig squeal before. He wore a bamboo hat, a worn raincoat, and a pair of long, large leather boots that reached above his thighs, almost covering his entire trousers.</p>
<p>"I hate live pigs. If it were ham, that would be great. Not to mention anything else, you could eat your fill!"</p>
<p>Then he began to ramble about the time he poled a ham raft, tired of eating ham, even throwing fatty meat into the water. He said that as long as your stomach could hold it, you could eat half a leg in one meal, and the ham merchant wouldn't say a word. And the ham raft only had the fatty, greasy aroma, absolutely none of the headache-inducing pig squeals and pig manure smell.</p>
<p>That manure smell was truly unbearable. Even on that clear, vast river, the pungent odor remained, as if you had locked countless fertilizer-soaked pigs in a small, unventilated room. "Is this raft yours?"</p>
<p>I suddenly thought to ask.</p>
<p>"No, it belongs to our master."</p>
<p>The raftsman fell silent, turning his head away, fearing I would ask him more. I heard that all the rafts on this river, large or small, belonged to raft owners. The raftsmen had to rent them at high prices, like rickshaw pullers, under very harsh conditions. So, although these raftsmen traveled back and forth on this river regardless of the cold or heat, they still couldn't make a living, let alone support their families.</p>
<p>The raft drifted downstream.</p>
<p>The mountains stretched along both banks, sometimes turning several bends, seeming to break the mountain range, but soon emerging with even more majestic, overlapping peaks.</p>
<p>Villages were scarce in this area, only a few scattered here and there. As our raft passed, many barefoot children ran out of the snow-covered houses to watch because they heard the pig squeals. There were many wooden bridges, one after another.</p>
<p>The snow kept falling, the sky was gray, and our mood was as bleak as the sky. It was New Year's. Instead of staying in a warm home, we had to brave the wind and snow, traveling on this river with these pigs, inevitably feeling a little melancholy.</p>
<p>As dusk approached, the raftsman tied the raft to a withered tree along the shore. On the beach, he chose a relatively dry spot and put up a cloth shed, inside which he spread some rice straw brought with the raft, as a bed.</p>
<p>He started a fire.</p>
<p>But the pigs squealed shrilly, gnawing at the fir timbers, and the pig manure smell spread in the darkness.</p>
<p>This continued until the next morning, when the raft was untied again...</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Problem of Muslims Not Eating Pork <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Yiyuan</p>
<p>I have experienced not eating pork, and I have felt the aversion to pork. My maternal grandfather was very knowledgeable about Islamic philosophy, and he often advised people to "recognize the True Master and sincerely aspire to goodness," not valuing those who merely perform rituals and pretend to be virtuous. When I was young, one day I went to the street with him and met someone carrying a string of pork coming towards us. I hurriedly pulled him away, saying:</p>
<p>"Grandpa! Quick, let it pass!"</p>
<p>"What?" he asked calmly.</p>
<p>"The pork is coming!"</p>
<p>"What does it matter? Why are you making such a fuss?"</p>
<p>It turned out that we Chinese Muslims not only don't eat pork, but even touching it is taboo. Clothes that have been touched by pork can only be worn normally after washing, and cannot be worn to the mosque for worship. I remember when I was young, I used to fight with non-Muslim children, and I felt quite brave, but as soon as I saw the opponent holding a piece of lard and chasing after me, I would be defeated without a fight! My grandfather only advocated not eating pork, and naturally he didn't deliberately touch it. If he accidentally touched a pig or pork, he also thought he had touched something unclean, but it could be washed away; he didn't need to avoid seeing pork as if it were a ghost. At that time, I didn't quite understand him, and I only heard the general Ah Hong (i.e., religious leader) say that he was "not good at teaching," and was a "heretic." Although the dark shadow of my faith has now been removed by the light of modern knowledge, I am always particularly interested in issues related to Islam or Muslims, and I often want to stand on the position of respecting other people's beliefs and contribute some opinions on habits that should be improved. At the same time, I also want to provide some research data for people who study sociology and religion. This article can be considered a starting point.</p>
<p>I have thoroughly checked the recently translated Quran and English and French translations, and they only contain articles prohibiting eating pork and do not mention any other taboos against pigs. Even the main text of the Chinese Islamic Canon only has two articles: "Do not eat the pig" and "Pig filth." Only in the Q&amp;A in the annotations is there such a question and answer: "If that is the case, is it enough to abstain from eating it? Why bother to avoid contact with the fishy and greasy, and hate it as an enemy? Answer: This is the meaning of preventing slight deviations and stopping them at the beginning. It cannot be otherwise."</p>
<p>Whether the opinions in the annotations are unique to China, I have not been able to find out for the time being, but the following three conversations with Muslims from other countries can be used for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Marseille for business, I took the time to visit a secretary in the Egyptian consulate who was a Muslim. After I explained the purpose of my visit, he expressed his welcome, and we began the following questions:</p>
<p>"Islam prohibits eating pork. Does it also prohibit touching pigs or pork?"</p>
<p>"No, the prohibition of eating is clearly stipulated in the Quran. Of course, if touching causes pollution, it should be washed."</p>
<p>"Do you cook your own meals here, or do you eat in ordinary restaurants?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, I go to restaurants to eat. Pork is more expensive than beef in Europe. If I want a plate of veal, they will never replace it with pork. We can rest assured."</p>
<p>"Our country's Muslims also prohibit touching pigs or pork. If clothes are touched, even after washing, they cannot be worn again during worship. Is this in accordance with scripture?"</p>
<p>"As far as I know, the Quran only has regulations on abstinence from eating. I dare not say anything else. But I know that there is an Egyptian Muslim who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca three times, and he should have more religious knowledge than me, and his business is raising pigs, raising them and selling them to Europeans. Then how can he avoid touching the pigs he raises? I think perhaps it is enough not to eat them."</p>
<p>"Can you tell me the reason for the prohibition of eating?"</p>
<p>"This is probably because pigs are too dirty and poisonous. Moreover, we live in the tropics..."</p>

<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>But Mother Xiang never came back after all, and Father had been saying the same words for three, five, ten years!</p>
<p>During these days, she saw white hair grow on her father's head because of sorrow; her father's health also deteriorated because of excessive drinking. She thought that besides reminiscing about the woman he loved, her father was also thinking that his daughter would soon follow the man she loved and leave. Then he would be left alone, living out his remaining years in solitude. So she told her father that she would absolutely not abandon him.</p>
<p>"Is that so, is that so?"</p>
<p>Father looked at her with doubtful eyes, but his voice was trembling for some reason.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying anything false or exaggerated."</p>
<p>She remembered how firmly she looked at her father's face at that time, and how extraordinary she looked.</p>
<p>"I don't want to ruin my daughter's youth for my sake."</p>
<p>"But I am willing to exchange my youth for my father's happy days, but there is one thing," she paused, "I don't want my father to indulge in alcohol anymore, it will harm your health!"</p>
<p>"I promise you, child."</p>
<p>So they hugged, and she felt her father's hot tears flowing on her neck, and she herself shed tears.</p>
<p>In this way, they spent a year of peaceful and beautiful days. She often pretended to be a child, wanting her father to forget his old age: she carefully served him, as considerate as a loyal lover. Father was often so moved that he seemed to have something to say, but she immediately interrupted him, not wanting him to continue, but saying herself:</p>
<p>"I am your daughter, all these things are what I should do."</p>
<p>But recently, Father has been haunted by that old melancholy again. He didn't say it clearly, maybe he thought in his heart that this was a bit unfair to his daughter; but he couldn't restrain himself; when he was suffering from the memories of the past, he would naturally look at the portrait hanging on the wall. In his eyes, it was not just a stiff portrait, but something that could laugh and talk with his thoughts. He remembered how her smile had two lovely dimples, and when she spoke, people could see how beautiful her teeth were. He also remembered that there was a crimson mole at the corner of her eye, but it was not in this portrait, because it was covered by her hair. He could still remember everything she had said, those empty words, and when he remembered them, it was as if she was whispering in his ear again. Now all this was gone, and only by recalling could a clear shadow flash through his mind.</p>
<p>The grown-up daughter had the same beautiful face as her mother, and such a good heart. He knew that his daughter's heart was good, better than her mother's, and better than all women's. Every time he thought this way, he could increase his belief in forgetting that heartless woman; but because of his daughter, he could also easily think of his daughter's mother. He often wanted to sit there alone, or take a walk, so that the old affection could be revived in his own heart. He wanted to avoid his daughter, because he knew that this was somewhat unfair to her.</p>
<p>That night, they sat there silently until fatigue made their eyes feel dry and their heads drooped slightly.</p>
<p>"Dad, go to sleep, it's getting late."</p>
<p>"Is it?"</p>
<p>He raised his eyes and looked at the clock hanging on the wall, it was already 11:25.</p>
<p>"Really, it's almost twelve o'clock, I still feel like it's only been a while."</p>
<p>She said this deliberately, but in fact, that night, she felt like a year had passed!</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go to sleep, let's go to sleep."</p>

<h3 id="e250">Inner Mongolia Autonomy <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Our country's national character and vitality were insufficiently cultivated from the beginning, and not enough effort was made to restore them afterward, resulting in a country with a hundred holes and a thousand sores, a sick man. After a carbuncle on his back just healed, his belly started bleeding again, attracting countless large green-headed flies, buzzing around him, waiting for a chance to choose a fatty spot and bite! This old man [sick man] and his body are constantly being bitten, even forming new sores that are about to fester. If the rest of his body doesn't help drive away the flies or assist with salvarsan 606 and 914, is it likely that the whole body will be bitten to death by the flies, one part at a time? It's like a rotten boat in a huge, turbulent wave. Everyone is working together to patch the cracks, still fearing that the dangerous situation cannot be sustained and that the treacherous shoals cannot be crossed. If everyone still harbors ulterior motives and private views, secretly and openly trying to flirt with a huge warship sailing head-on—a warship that will crush the broken boat, seize jade and silk, and eat flesh and blood—do you think the people in this boat are the kind who are "wearing official hats but fleeing towards death"?</p>
<p>Reports say that the Central Political Council has passed eleven articles on Inner Mongolia's autonomous rule. They certainly sound reasonable. However, thinking back to the fate of its elder brother—Outer Mongolia, which has now disappeared without a trace—it also started with a grand and imposing autonomy. Moreover, Inner Mongolia's increasingly intense demands for autonomy come after the great pain of losing the Northeast and at a time when the puppet organization is about to change its name to "Manchukuo" and has already invaded Chahar East, occupying Zhaojiayingzi (all reported in the newspaper on the 18th). The passage of those eleven articles has caused our startled and fearful hearts and our thoughts after the pain to arouse a hot, stinging sensation, as if thinking with pain: "That rabbit is probably about to leave that burrow!"</p>
<p>But the world is so big, strange things are truly endless. As mentioned above, at this time of serious national crisis, when we should be helping each other in the same boat, the passage of those eleven articles on autonomy already feels like an unfortunate and excessive product! Unexpectedly, Inner Mongolia's league and banner representatives, Zhao Taibao and fourteen others, still thought it was not enough and went directly to the Central Political Council to petition for maintaining Minister Huang's original plan negotiated at Bailingmiao, that is, to further increase the powers of the autonomous region government (see the newspaper on the 19th), "otherwise we will absolutely not dare to accept it and will only return to Mongolia with tears of blood, awaiting slaughter." How urgent their desire for autonomy is, and how determined they are to oppose the review proposal is something we should not ignore. Reading their petition, the tone seems very much like a man in Qi who has a wife and a concubine. Unfortunately, his family fortune has declined, his wife has secretly fled with her lover, and his concubine wants a divorce but cannot get it, and he can't help but say resentfully: "My wife secretly fled, you have no say! Now my concubine formally proposes economic independence, no, formally seeks a peaceful divorce with you, but you hinder and doubt her, why are you so unappreciative?" Can this kind of vile tone not make people hate them to death?</p>
<h3 id="e251">Ought to be the Task <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>It was probably four or five years ago, it was a summer day, it was two days before the summer vacation, it was the summer when I graduated from junior high school, the term exams were over, and I was already more than half happy, especially after I found out that my score was passing, that was even more indescribably happy. So I gathered a large group of classmates and went to talk to a certain teacher, and sit with a certain Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang's small room was completely occupied by our large group of classmates. Mr. Wang suddenly asked me: "Zu, are you planning to go to high school?" "I am planning to go to high school," I replied simply. "I suggest you go to a mission school." Mr. Wang offered his opinion on finding a school so frankly and straightforwardly. "Hmph! Go to a mission school, do you want to learn fluent English? What good is fluent English to reality? To be a slave to a conquered country, to be a running dog? It is better to go to a national or provincial school." Mr. Xu arrogantly corrected Mr. Wang's weakness. "Mr. Xu, you said that it is better to go to a national or provincial school, to seek some practical knowledge. Where did that come from? What are national and provincial schools paying attention to? Today, supporting this, tomorrow overthrowing that? In the morning, opening some kind of autonomy association, in the afternoon, opening a student council, in fact, what kind of flowers are opened after opening and opening? No one knows that? Actually, young people living in the world today is really extremely difficult, those without money to study can continue to study, secretly shedding tears, and those who have prepared money to study are still facing difficulties everywhere, and finally [fluent English] and supporting, overthrowing, and holding meetings cannot solve the question of bread for young people."</p>
<p>Today, many years later. I went to participate in a ×× entertainment meeting. During the ceremony of the ×× entertainment meeting, it was the turn of the teachers and elders to give speeches. A middle-aged teacher took the stage to speak: "... Like mission schools, which prohibit students from free activities in the school, even if there are any meetings, the teachers order them to be carried out rigidly. The establishment of this ×× entertainment meeting at our school today is completely student-initiated. The school is completely in the position of an observer, so this spirit is respectable and lovely ..."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, a slight wave rose in my heart, and a nameless shadow floated up. It is said that this ×× entertainment meeting was cultivated by sacrificing the entire precious study time of many students. A school is a small society. In addition to reading dead books, of course, I do not object to various extracurricular activities in the school, but the so-called extracurricular activities should also have considerable limits. If they do some kind of ghost tricks at will, as long as the location is within the school, it is considered an extracurricular activity in the school, which is always very ridiculous. But I always believe that when they are young, in addition to being lively, they should also be guided to develop good reading habits, which is the task that teachers should do.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Don't Just Laugh at Others <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Where to Go</p>
<p>Westerners worship God, Indians worship the Great God, Muslims worship the Living Buddha, and Chinese people worship their ancestors. Regardless of whether this God, Great God, Living Buddha, or Ancestor is dead or alive, fictitious or real, has an idol or does not have an idol, in short, they are all kinds of idol worship, all kinds of seeking help from the superhuman divine power that may or may not exist to solve their own problems in real life when they encounter difficulties. There is no distinction between superior and inferior in this.</p>
<p>Some people believe in God, and then laugh at Muslims, saying that their kind of worship is foolish and absurd. This is just like Chinese people laughing at Westerners for worshipping God, and worshippers of God laughing at Chinese people for worshipping their ancestors, which is equally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Watching the performance of the funny character in the theater is certainly funny, but those laughing audiences may not be funny themselves. People who hold lettuce and bite it while mocking those who bite live fish are not necessarily truly clever, nor are they necessarily more civilized than the latter.</p>
<p>People always feel that their own is good. People wearing Western suits laugh at those wearing robes, and people wearing robes laugh at those wearing Western suits. But looking at it coldly, which is not ridiculous?</p>
<h3 id="e253">Fortune and Fate <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>In the current economic crisis that is deepening day by day, the "fate" of the general public, if they do not rise up and actively control it themselves; then "fate" will control you, destined to be swept by the tide of panic below the starvation line, which is already "undoubtedly" without needing to consult the tortoise shell. But many people do not understand this, wanting to become "lucky ones" amidst the agitation of the entire society's masses tending towards poverty, bankruptcy, suicide, and being killed. Therefore, they fast and bathe, pray to gods and worship Buddha, hoping to have the "God of Wealth and Bodhisattva" come under the protection of the divine sky. This kind of phenomenon at the end of society is enough to express the general public's passive attitude of "unsurpassed resentment" towards the status quo, but it is also their cowardly mentality of hoping for luck and living in peace. This kind of cowardly mentality, just like monks and nuns taking advantage of it to consolidate God's "will" while making a lot of money for themselves, is also used by social rulers to chant "national prosperity" and "national future" as spells, while making a fortune for themselves. This is the biggest of them. As for the wind of superiors and subordinates following suit, shops, companies, and restaurants also use "hope for × million yuan" to attract customers, practicing their road to wealth of "losing money and restraining themselves," it is as numerous as books and cannot be detailed.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can win prizes by smoking cigarettes now, we can win prizes by washing soap, and recently we can even win prizes by eating soup dumplings at Risheng Building on Nanjing Road. If you spend ten Sun Yat-sen silver dollars to "enthusiastically save the country," you can hope to become a millionaire worth 500,000 yuan, which is even more well-known. This shows that although our China is the poorest country in the world, the "God of Wealth and Bodhisattva" are everywhere, as long as your "ancestors have virtue," you can have the shining of a lucky star. But according to a report from the National News Agency on the 13th: the United States is also planning to imitate our country's method and has decided to issue national lottery tickets, which makes us feel even more "our path is not lonely."</p>
<p>After Roosevelt took office in the United States with the slogans of saving the crisis and relieving unemployment, there was a lot of noise, White House talks, London conferences, currency inflation, and industrial recovery, and again and again, he found a "magic pill" to treat the incurable disease of the capitalist system. But some things go against people's wishes. Although the Eagle flag flutters throughout the country, until now, almost a year has passed, and the number of unemployed people is still more than 10 million, the market still does not see how prosperous it is, and in the context of currency inflation and rising prices, the market has shrunk instead, and the so-called industrial recovery in the United States is even more "vague." Therefore, Roosevelt, the god of fate of this Yankee race, is becoming increasingly exhausted, gradually losing his faith under the disappointment of the people's desire to "find work and eat bread." Therefore, the clever Roosevelt came up with a plan of "golden cicada shedding its shell" to prevent the general public's despair about saving the crisis and relieving unemployment from being blamed on himself, and in the struggle of hunger, he gave them the opportunity to get rich - issuing national lottery tickets. Thus, thousands and tens of thousands of unemployed people groaning in hunger and cold clench their stomachs and wait for the arrival of "fortune," no longer taking risks and entering the path of extremism, the country is peaceful, and the world is fine. Therefore, the so-called "national" "revival" ×× lottery ticket wind is prevalent for a time. In the current situation where the broad masses of the people are mired in extreme poverty, it does not come out of the following two meanings:</p>
<p>First, the economic crisis and the unemployment and poverty of the people are caused by the imperfection of the social and economic system,</p>
<p>Second, the people are blessed by unemployment and bankruptcy, and almost nothing can be scraped from them in the form of direct taxes and indirect taxes, except for their bare hands.</p>
<p>Here we may as well repeatedly remind those who hope that "fortune" will come to be vigilant. At this time when the economic crisis is sweeping the world, your "fate" has been decided by the mountains, either to shed a few more drops of sweat and tears for the "nation and people," or to serve the "motherland" on the battlefield as cannon fodder. The so-called national lottery tickets and what lottery tickets are just "sleeping pills" to guide you on this path, if you do not bravely rise up and control your own "fate."</p>
<h3 id="e254">Carving Out a Path to Survival! <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Zhuzi</p>
<p>In this day and age, there are two kinds of people who can make a living: first, the sons of wealthy capitalists and old gentry; second, those who gamble, run brothels, speculate, or open banks. Anything else is simply too difficult to survive! Open a factory or a store? Heavy taxes, difficulty in collecting debts, troublesome employees, and exorbitant rent: managing to scrape by is the best outcome; closing down and going bankrupt is no cause for complaint. This is indeed the current state of China, so opening a factory or a store is not "good business." Go to school? Not to mention primary and secondary schools, even graduating from university and finding a six-yuan-a-month internship is not easy. Moreover, studying requires capital, unlike the old days of "rising from humble beginnings" and "commoners becoming officials." If your family has connections and influence, you can hold onto two, three, four, or five...rice bowls, otherwise, no matter how talented and knowledgeable you are, no one will seek your advice, and you won't even be allowed to hold onto half a rice bowl. Therefore, studying is also not "good business." Work as a clerk and eat someone else's rice? First, you need connections, and with a recommendation, you also need a guarantor. Once the recommendation and guarantee are settled, you also need to understand the art of dealing with people, diligence and patience are essential; knowing how to flatter is even more essential. If you adhere to the old moral code, with its principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, you are guaranteed to face obstacles and be hindered at every turn. The new era has new morals. Can those who are well-versed in ethics textbooks adapt to modern society? Therefore, working as a clerk and eating someone else's rice is also not "good business." So, what is this so-called "good business"? I believe that to carve out a bloody path in this dark and bewildering life journey, one must quickly emulate Columbus, the explorer of the New World!</p>
<p>The cries of modern youth are filled with a gloomy and miserable atmosphere. All publications are filled with these cries of misery. In reality, this is fundamentally wrong! If you were to file a complaint on the street, would the gentlemen and ladies in their cars jump out to help you? Filing a complaint with robbers is no different! Will these impoverished scholars' meager writings ever catch the eye of the gentlemen and ladies? Therefore, instead of writing these essays in vain, it is better to discover a new land for yourself.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Jia Changsha's tearful articles and Qu Lingjun's wandering by the riverbank not only failed to move the hearts of rulers, but even drowning oneself in the Miluo River would be a "wrongful death"!</p>
<p>How to find a new land for yourself? To use a gambler's term: it's called "betting on a long shot." While everyone is rushing to the cities, I will rush to the countryside. Although the rural areas are bankrupt, there are still many things that can be done: animal husbandry, planting trees, and trading. Moreover, rural life is less expensive, with plenty of sunshine, good air, and relatively kind people. One can drink wine and tend to hemp, not caring about governance and chaos. There are many things to do in the countryside. Is there only one path to take—the cities? Having said that, it's not like the cities are impossible to go to. First, choosing a career requires caution and careful consideration. If the "true meaning of life" lies in making money, then, if you cannot follow the wealthy old men in the cities, you must associate with idle friends. It all depends on the individual's ingenuity, and it is not difficult to "shake" yourself up one day. Otherwise, carrying an old goods pole or running a few stalls, being diligent and thrifty, you still won't starve. Otherwise, cheating, swindling, stealing, looting, selling daughters as dancers, actresses, or "salted meat," sons picking up cigarette butts, pulling yellow cattle across bridges, robbing pimps, skinning pigs, taking bribes, or running gambling dens are all enough to make you a "master" in Shanghai. These are all "long shots" and new lands discovered by Columbus!</p>
<p>Enough with the idle talk, let's get back to the main topic. Although the universe is narrow, there is still a place to eat. Do not blindly follow the crowd and sink into despair. You should use your brain a little and "bet on a long shot." Filing complaints in publications is useless. At the same time, why don't the editors of various publications put the valuable space to better use by publishing more novel and practical articles on small businesses and small crafts, so that the youth who are wandering on the wrong path can carve out a path to survival? Wouldn't that be more beneficial?</p>
<h3 id="e255">Selling Smiles <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>"Selling smiles" usually refers to prostitutes who provide entertainment with their bodies, but the actual meaning is no longer encompassed by these two words. However, it is also used in its original sense. On December 27th of last year, a news item appeared in the newspaper as follows:</p>
<p>London, World News Agency: Miss Petans Panlin is a woman who earns her living by "smiling" for the whole world. She fears that her beautiful smile may one day fade, so she has insured her smile for 1,000 pounds. She must smile fifty times a week, allowing various newspapers and magazines to capture her image. She recently told someone: "My smile is my most precious property and cannot be lost, so I have insured it for 1,000 pounds. Sometimes I get tired of smiling, so I just get in my car, disappear for dozens of days, and then return."</p>
<p>Upon first reading this news, it seems that Miss Petans Panlin must be extraordinarily noble, with a smile worth insuring for 1,000 pounds. But upon closer thought, the situation is quite tragic.</p>
<p>Smiling is the ultimate expression of emotion and must be heartfelt, that is, unintentional. Whether you "smile gently" or "laugh uncontrollably," there is always an underlying reason why you cannot help but smile. We cannot force someone who wants to cry to sing, just as we cannot force someone who wants to sing to cry. When smiling becomes "acting," it completely loses the meaning of "smiling" and is actually close to crying, or even worse. The common saying "selling smiles by the door" is only the observation of the host. From the perspective of the "seller," it should be "tears" and "blood." Laughter before a feast often turns into tears on the pillow. How often can a trace of true joy be found in the world of pleasure? Using the blood and tears of others for one's own laughter is a cruelty that humanity has always engaged in. Miss Petans Panlin's pride only makes her more pitiful.</p>
<p>But then again, earning a "living" by "smiling" is ultimately an easy and welcome thing, as long as you don't think of yourself as a person, a person with independent dignity. People who serve the gentlemen and ladies day and night, taking their joys and sorrows as their own, are "born in this world" and can be found everywhere. It's not just Miss Petans Panlin's unique behavior. These people, like Miss Petans Panlin, proudly regard their "smile" as their "most precious property," fearing its loss, but are completely unaware of their pitiful state. This kind of "selling" should be distinguished from the "selling smiles" of prostitutes who are forced into a life of prostitution due to social persecution.</p>

<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>You said again based on my words:</p>
<p>"I can't ruin him by letting him continue to degenerate like this. It's better for me to leave him!"</p>
<p>"You want to leave? Where will you go?" I was so surprised!</p>
<p>"I'll go back to my mother's place, but I'm someone who ran away from a marriage, and I don't want to go back! I'm a lonely person, and even if I want to leave him, there's no path for me to take!..." You said, and burst into tears!</p>
<p>You are truly pitiful, but how can I comfort you? Can I encourage you to seek an independent life? I can't. Because Renjie is my friend, and he loves you. My words of comfort at the time were so irrelevant. I said,</p>
<p>"Renjie is just acting differently recently, he is a good and promising young man, you shouldn't leave him, if you leave him, you will only ruin him more, he will not know how far he will degenerate!"</p>
<p>You were silent. I also felt that there was nothing to say.</p>
<p>Before long, Renjie returned. He was still so dejected, and at the same time, he was complaining. When I brought up his decadence and disregard for life, he denied it with heroic spirit. I could only sarcastically say that it was good that he wasn't degenerating.</p>
<p>A few days later, he ran to my place, laughing wildly as soon as he entered the door. This was naturally "abnormal," and I was very surprised and worried. I was worried because you must have left him. I knew you had left him, but I didn't tell him. If I had told him first, he might have changed his behavior and confessed to you and gained your understanding. Wouldn't that have been okay? Wouldn't that have prevented him from going so crazy? I regretted it. This was my fault! But it was too late. You had left him, and he was crazy! God, I am a sinner!</p>
<p>He laughed wildly for a long time before saying this:</p>
<p>"My Mary, she, left me, she's gone!"</p>
<p>Saying that, he laughed again, fell back on the chair, his bloodshot eyes staring at the ceiling. Suddenly, without warning, he stood up from the chair, grabbed my collar with both hands, and shouted,</p>
<p>"Look, is our life destined to be a tragedy?"</p>
<p>I sympathized with his situation, and his words struck a chord in my heart. I, too, was acting out a tragedy on the road of life! How could I comfort him at that time? I was the one who needed comfort!</p>
<p>"There's no way out for us, our thoughts are bitten by poisonous snakes, our emotions are like a volcano erupting, but even our loved ones can't give me a little comfort, we," he cried miserably, "are we already on the path to the grave? Are we destined to commit suicide?"</p>
<p>Besides hugging him and comforting him, what words could I use to comfort him?</p>
<p>"No, no!" he cried again, "We are not weak, we are not bastards, we have to catch up with the times, we have to die for meaningful sacrifices, we cannot commit suicide; suicide is the act of the weak, suicide is a shameful act!... Women, women, women are devils! But..." his voice became faint and weak again, "I love her, I can't live a day without her! Look, she is so beautiful and gentle, and her attitude is so generous. Who among our girlfriends can compare to her..." At this time, I helped him to the lotus throne and gave him a glass of water to drink 重I said</p>
<p>"Opening the　　　　　　　　　the same　isn't　a joke?"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his face changed immediately, the fire of anger burned in his bloodshot eyes, and he said to me fiercely.</p>

<h3 id="e258">A Visit with Chinese Film Artists (34) (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(XIV) "Struggle" Director Shi Dongshan (Part 2)</p>
<p>"In the current situation, do you have any opinions on political matters?" I asked. "I feel that no matter what the political environment, we should always criticize and denounce political errors and social ills from the standpoint of a citizen. Of course, films should be related to politics, but forcing films to become the mouthpiece of politics is ultimately a very foolish method. Because it is ultimately impossible. Unless the film artists themselves feel deeply satisfied with a certain political ideology."</p>
<p>"Then what kind of films do you think China needs at present?" I asked again. "Of course, I am not satisfied with the current society, so I think there is a great need for films that expose social contradictions. Naturally, this must be proven by facts. I personally oppose films that only expose without giving any direction. We should make the audience become the driving force for promoting society after watching the film. It is very clear that society has problems, and the people themselves also have problems. For example, we blame non-resistance, but we should also show the power of resistance ourselves. Many people often like to sit alone and make sarcastic remarks, which is a very wrong attitude..."</p>
<p>He said many other things here, which need not be recorded one by one. Then I said;</p>
<p>"Now what I want to know is your opinion on world cinema."</p>
<p>"Humph, this is a big topic. But simply put, I think the recent Russian films are indeed very powerful in propaganda. Their films are not just something fun. British films have made great progress in recent years. American films have a few writers who are struggling hard in their consciousness, striving to improve. German films have been scarce recently, with no new ideas. In short, the films of all countries are striving to raise their own status, but Chinese films do not recognize their great power, which is really a pity."</p>
<p>"To say another sentence, film must change with social changes, and film must become what the audience needs."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I asked him about his future film production plans. His answer was that social and national issues are equally important, because both are urgently needed at present. For example, this film "Woman" deals with social issues, and the next film will deal with national issues. Then I asked;</p>
<p>"Since you entered the film industry, how many films have you made?"</p>
<p>"Let me think about it." He said: "...Humph, it's twelve in total."</p>
<p>"Among them, can you list the important ones that you consider satisfactory?"</p>
<p>"This..." he said in the tone of a Beijing opera recitation.</p>
<p>"Homosexual Love"丨丨 1925 (24 years old)</p>
<p>"Children and Grandchildren's Fortune"丨丨丨 1926</p>
<p>"Four Heroes of the Wang Family"丨丨 1926</p>
<p>"Extraordinary Woman"丨丨丨 1928</p>
<p>"Hengniang"丨丨丨丨 1930</p>
<p>"Struggle"丨丨丨丨 1932 (31 years old)</p>
<p>Finally, I asked him about his experience in entering the film industry. His answer was;</p>
<p>"I was originally a person who studied painting, and I often went to the ChunGuang Art Association. Later, because I was friends with Dan Duyu, I became an actor in the Shanghai Film Company, but it was actually just an amateur role. This was when I was twenty years old. Because I was able to draw, I occasionally drew a few title backgrounds, and gradually became involved in set design and so on. Until I was twenty-three years old, I began to direct a film called "Yanghua Hen," which starred the so-called 'flirty sister' Han Yunzhen... The rest can be omitted."</p>
<p>The conversation ended here, and there is no need to record other idle talk in detail. On this day, we talked about social news and even national affairs, until about one o'clock in the afternoon, before braving the heavy snow to go home. (End of XIV)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e259">Review of "Exhibition" <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨Produced by Star, Premiered at XinGuang丨</p>
<p>"Exhibition" is largely adapted from "The Lin Family Shop," which is a very obvious fact. Of course, we do not require the playwright to be completely faithful to the novel, because literature and film have great differences in the creative process. However, "Exhibition" and the original work have completely changed their original essence, especially after the failure of Xie Changyuan's (Lin Family Shop) foreign goods store, plus a section of "promoting domestic products," "exhibitions," etc., which is completely contrary to the entire theme. I think this is the most unwise method. As for the many other places where the original meaning of the original work has been abandoned, that is of course another problem.</p>
<p>Rural bankruptcy, reduced purchasing power, indirect and direct extortion and exploitation, conspiracies and infighting between merchants, unrest in the times, financial panic, merchants' slow turnover, and small capital stores can only face a very miserable bankruptcy. This is the most obvious and inevitable fact. At the same time, it must be clearly written in the original work: "It would be strange if he didn't collapse... The master extorts him, the money shop oppresses him, and the same industry slanders him, and he has to eat bad debts, who can bear such heavy torture?... "</p>
<p>These things are all said in a very obscure way in the film. However, at the end, the playwright suddenly adds an inexplicable tail. The spirit of advocating domestic products with earnestness is commendable, but it is an extremely incomprehensible contradiction in "Exhibition." For example, after Xie Changyuan's bankruptcy, the YongShengXiang family, who had committed many evils, also went bankrupt, saying that it was affected by Xie Changyuan, which is also an unsustainable place. This is completely a cowardly act to cater to the audience's feudal established psychology and to achieve a retribution that is clear to all. Of course, we are not saying that YongShengXiang can still survive in this recession, but in order to make people happy, we cannot say a better reason. But it cannot but make people criticize. Suppose, just after Boss Zhao escaped, his production was auctioned off and shared; wouldn't this tragic ending deepen the stimulation of the merchants more?</p>
<p>We cannot forget the director's method in his considerable success in "Fragrant Grass Beauty." But in this film, he completely failed.</p>
<p>㈠We cannot clearly distinguish which one is YongShengXiang and which one is Xie Changyuan, and sometimes we mistakenly refer to A as B. This reminds us of Warner's "Business," which is also two stores across the street; the difference is too great.</p>
<p>㈡There is no emotion in the play, and even a little melancholy atmosphere is not well grasped. I think this is the place that makes the audience feel the most disappointed.</p>
<p>㈢The sets are too simple and too fake. Snow is made of cotton wool, white powder, and paper scraps. Isn't this intentional to make people sigh?</p>
<p>㈣The actors have no roles to play, especially Sun Min and Wang Mengshi, they are simply a little bit of fine decoration. The better ones are of course Xie Yunqing and Gao Yian. Wang Zhengxin is next, Xia Peizhen is next, as for a man wearing a black velvet mandarin jacket, decorated with a water pipe, who plays the owner of the money shop, it really makes people laugh.</p>
<p>㈤The makeup is too fake, especially the owner of the money shop. Xie Yunqing also has the same problem in several scenes. I really don't understand why he is so careless?</p>
<p>In short, this is a work below the standard line of the Star Company.</p>
<h3 id="e260">In Memory of Mr. Jin Chuansong <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Chuansong was a worker in the electrical department of the Lianhua No. 2 Factory, and also an excellent and hardworking technician in our film culture movement. At the end of 1933, when he participated in the film "Song of the Fishermen" directed by Mr. Cai Chusheng, he was accidentally stabbed in the foot by a nail on the photography field, and the wound festered and finally died in the Sports Hospital on January 10 of this year. To commemorate our loss of a loyal comrade, we held a memorial meeting at the Lianhua No. 2 Factory Club on the 14th of this month. At the meeting, we especially expressed our greatest respect for Mr. Jin's spirit of independently helping with work after being injured, and cited it as a model for each of our colleagues in the future. At the same time, it pointed out that only by improving the factory's internal medical equipment and developing the close mutual assistance spirit among colleagues can the recurrence of unfortunate events be reduced. At the same time, in order to commemorate Mr. Jin's great working spirit, it was decided to erect a bronze plaque in the second factory for permanent commemoration. Finally, the colleagues initiated a post-mortem donation to maintain the old age of Mr. Jin's mother, and the various post-mortem measures for Mr. Jin were also entrusted to the service department of the Colleague Association by the General Assembly for proper handling.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Screen Couple Gainor and Farrell to Collaborate Again <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— A Yun</p>
<p>In the past year, the problem of the non-cooperation of Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell was a major change that shocked the silver screen, and even Farrell voluntarily terminated the contract and left Fox, and those who had a good impression of them both expressed considerable regret. However, according to the recent formal announcement of Fox, Gainor and Farrell will partner again and continue to cooperate on two films, and a contract has been formally signed. It is indeed a more gratifying fact for movie fans all over the world who have been looking forward to it for a long time. Even Farrell himself wanted to struggle out of a new form and a new self in the re-cooperation. Therefore, before the contract was signed, he specifically put forward a clause that he had the right to accept or reject the script, and it had to conform to his tonality and have a considerable opportunity to act. He will no longer be an appendage of Gainor, and he wants audiences all over the world to understand that he is a member with a rich personality, and he does not rely on Gainor's performance to achieve his fame. The first film began work at the beginning of this month, and the title has not yet been formally announced</p>
<h3 id="e262">Charlie Chaplin and German Chancellor Hitler <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ying</p>
<p>An American film magazine said with a humorous tone: Hitler's subordinates will be at odds with Charlie Chaplin, because the little mustache of this comedian is too indistinguishable from the little mustache of Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party, the majestic chancellor of Germany. Some people also said that Charlie himself was unwilling to keep that little mustache, because he was afraid of being mistaken for Hitler. Some people also said that the German National Socialist Party has asked Charlie to shave off his little mustache, because his ridiculous little mustache is obviously joking with their leader. But we must know that Charlie's little mustache is not from today. Long before Hitler's name was known, this comedian had already used that little mustache, big boots, and cane as his trademark. According to trademark law, Hitler is still a counterfeit! But it is a very obvious thing that Charlie Chaplin's films may be difficult to enter German territory.</p>

<p>— By Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Judge Li Qi said: [What? Only you deserve that flower, because you yourself are more beautiful than a magnolia. But you haven't seen what's inside the flower yet.] Qiong saw a small package in the middle of the bouquet, and she went to take it. Li Qi quickly stopped her, saying: [Child, don't move it yet, it's not time yet. Wait until you get to your dressing room before opening it.] Qiong smiled coquettishly: [Whatever it is, it's great.] After she finished speaking, she took the flowers back to her dressing room.</p>
<p>Qiong Huilan returned to the dressing room, where Tex was waiting. She unfolded the small package and found a diamond-encrusted bracelet inside. Qiong Huilan exclaimed excitedly: [Tex, come and see, what is this! Judge Li Qi gave it to me! This thing is really beautiful, but of course I can't accept it.] Tex carefully examined the bracelet, then handed it back to Qiong Huilan, saying: [Hey, Qiong, you haven't really made your mark in this kind of place yet, but you have a lot of potential. So I want to tell you, you know people always say that a fool is born every minute in the world, but in fact, it's not like that at all. Fools are rare and hard to find. And, have you ever heard of anyone being poisoned to death by platinum?] After she said that, she stretched out her arm, looked at the bracelets covering her arm, and said: [These things will be very useful when I get older. You have to remember how these things are obtained; it's not by shaking your head from side to side, but by nodding your head up and down.] Now, do you still want to return that bracelet to that guy?] Qiong Huilan said: [Of course, I should return it to him.] Tex shook her head, displaying a look of hopelessness, and walked away.</p>
<p>Qiong Huilan was telling the truth; she said she didn't know Frank Luoqi, who introduced her to this nightclub. Luoqi was a notorious bad guy, and Tex Kalai was also not a good person. Of course, the nightclub she ran was not a reputable place. Qiong Huilan still remembered when she was a child, Frank was a friend of her older sister. At that time, everyone already knew that Frank was a bad kid in the neighborhood. Later, she heard people say that he had joined a gangster group. But she never knew that he had now become the most feared crime boss in New York. What does he do? He is the chairman of a [Chicken and Duck Insurance Association]. All chicken and duck merchants in the New York area must pay Frank Luoqi a protection tax according to the size of their business in order to safely deliver their goods to their customers' homes. Qiong Huilan's older sister, Yiseer, asked him to recommend her younger sister to a theater to study. In Tex's nightclub, Luoqi's words were law, so Qiong Huilan was sent here to work as a singer. One day, Luoqi and his bodyguard Chuck, and Chuck's woman Bierre, came to the nightclub to watch the performance. He gradually noticed the last woman in the row. Tex happened to walk over at this moment. (To be continued)</p>
